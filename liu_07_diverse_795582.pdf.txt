Abstract
Background: Salmonella paratyphi C, like S. typhi, is adapted to humans and causes typhoid fever.
Previously we reported different genome structures between two strains of S. paratyphi C, which
suggests that S. paratyphi C might have a plastic genome (large DNA segments being organized in
different orders or orientations on the genome). As many but not all host-adapted Salmonella
pathogens have large genomic insertions as well as the supposedly resultant genomic
rearrangements, bacterial genome plasticity presents an extraordinary evolutionary phenomenon.
Events contributing to genomic plasticity, especially large insertions, may be associated with the
formation of particular Salmonella pathogens.
Results: We constructed a high resolution genome map in S. paratyphi C strain RKS4594 and
located four insertions totaling 176 kb (including the 90 kb SPI7) and seven deletions totaling 165
kb relative to S. typhimurium LT2. Two rearrangements were revealed, including an inversion of
1602 kb covering the ter region and the translocation of the 43 kb I-CeuI F fragment. The 23 wild
type strains analyzed in this study exhibited diverse genome structures, mostly as a result of
recombination between rrn genes. In at least two cases, the rearrangements involved
recombination between genomic sites other than the rrn genes, possibly homologous genes in
prophages. Two strains had a 20 kb deletion between rrlA and rrlB, which is a highly conservative
region and no deletion has been reported in this region in any other Salmonella lineages.
Conclusion: S. paratyphi C has diverse genome structures among different isolates, possibly as a
result of large genomic insertions, e.g., SPI7. Although the Salmonella typhoid agents may not be
more closely related among them than each of them to other Salmonella lineages, they may have
evolved in similar ways, i.e., acquiring typhoid-associated genes followed by genome structure
rearrangements. Comparison of multiple Salmonella typhoid agents at both single sequenced
genome and population levels will facilitate the studies on the evolutionary process of typhoid
pathogenesis, especially the identification of typhoid-associated genes.

Background
Of the over 2500 Salmonella serotypes recognized to date
[1], about 1400 infect humans and other warm-blooded
vertebrates, which are classified into Salmonella subgroup
I (now often referred to as Salmonella enterica subspecies
enterica [2-4]). Although most of these Salmonella serotypes cause self-limiting gastroenteritis in humans, four
cause typhoid fever, a serious and potentially fatal systemic infection, including S. typhi (see a recent review [5])
and S. paratyphi A, B and C. It is a long unanswered question whether different Salmonella typhoid agents cause the
disease by similar or distinct mechanisms. As all Salmonella share high levels of genetic similarity, it is possible to
reveal genetic differences or similarities in pathogenicity
among the Salmonella typhoid agents by focusing on
genomic features common to some or all of the Salmonella
typhoid agents.
The extraordinary levels of genetic similarity among salmonellae were recognized first by genomic DNA re-association experiments [6], later by physical mapping [7,8],
and recently by whole genome sequencing [9-13]. In the
mid-1990s, physical mapping revealed an overall common genome structure among all Salmonella; it also
revealed special features of individual Salmonella lineages,
such as the major genomic insertions and rearrangements
of S. typhi [14-16] and S. paratyphi A [17], which were later
all confirmed by whole genome sequencing [9,11,12].
Sequence comparison of the Salmonella genomes further
reveals that about 13% of the genes in S. typhi are not
found in S. typhimurium [9,10], and many of these serovar-specific genes were apparently acquired by lateral
transfer of large DNA segments from other sources [18],
which, if 12 kb or larger, can be resolved on the physical
maps [14,17,19-22].
Several lines of evidence suggest that the typhoid agents
have not evolved by vertical descent of one from another,
as genetic distances are not closer among the typhoid
agents than each of them to the non-typhoidal salmonellae [12,23-25]. However, they may have common or similar routes of acquisition of genes coding for the typhoid
pathogenicity. Comparison of multiple typhoid agents
may lead to identification of these genes.
S. paratyphi C is a member of serogroup C1 [2], causing
typhoid in humans but, unlike S. typhi, also occasionally
infecting animals [26]. Previously we reported I-CeuI
maps on two S. paratyphi C strains, RKS4587 and
RKS4594, which are very different in size and organization of the seven I-CeuI fragments. In several ways, S. paratyphi C is similar to S. typhi, including the possession of a
large pathogenicity island, SPI7, with genes coding for the
Vi (virulence) antigen and other genes potentially associated with virulence [9,14,15,27-29]. It is thus of great sig-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/290

nificance to reveal the genomic features of S. paratyphi C
at higher resolution and involving a broader range of wild
type strains, and then compare them with those of S. typhi
to explore the evolution of the typhoid-associated pathogenicity. In this paper, we first report a high resolution
genome map of a representative S. paratyphi C strain,
RKS4594, featured with several insertions, deletions and
rearrangements. We then present genome maps of additional wild type strains of S. paratyphi C constructed with
I-CeuI, which reveal diverse genome structures among the
wild type strains of S. paratyphi C. Some strains have deletions in the highly conserved metE-argE region, which
have not previously been observed in any other Salmonella
strains.

Results
Cleavage of S. paratyphi C RKS4594 genomic DNA with ICeuI
I-CeuI is an intron-encoded endonuclease, with cleavage
sites in rrl genes [7,30-33]. Cleavage of S. paratyphi C
RKS4594 genomic DNA with I-CeuI generated seven fragments (Figure 1). This number is consistent with the previously analyzed Salmonella genomes [8], as all Salmonella
lineages have seven rrl genes.

In Figure 1A, there are bright as well as less bright DNA
bands, the latter being labeled as combinations of two or
three of the seven bright bands. These less bright DNA
bands are partial cleavage products showing the neighboring relationships of the seven I-CeuI cleaved DNA segments. Analyses of both complete and partial I-CeuI
cleavages resulted in the cleavage map of S. paratyphi C
RKS4594 in Figure 1B. In designation of the I-CeuI fragments, the same letters were used to label homologous
DNA segments in different Salmonella lineages. In S. typhimurium LT2, the order of the seven I-CeuI fragments is
ABCDEFG clockwise, but in S. paratyphi C RKS4594 the
order is ABCFDEG due to the translocation of fragment F.
Translocations of I-CeuI fragments are usually mediated
by homologous recombination between pairs of the rrn
genes [15,16,34,35], which usually have greater than 99%
sequence identity. The translocation of I-CeuI F in S. paratyphi C RKS4594 led to three hybrid rrn operons. The rrl
genes are used to exemplify the hybrid rrn operons in Figure 1B, shown as rrlC/B, rrlE/C and rrlB/E, but recombination may also occur in rrs.
XbaI and AvrII cleavages and transposon Tn10 insertion
analysis of the genome
XbaI cleavage generated 23 fragments, ranging from 684
kb (band A in Figure 2A) to 3 kb (band W, run out of the
gel in Figure 2A but seen on other gels). AvrII cleavage
generated 26 fragments, ranging from 866 kb (band A in
Figure 2B) to 11 kb (band Z, run out of the gel in Figure
2B). To determine the order of fragments in both XbaI and

description in the text about complete and partial cleavages of the genomic DNA with I-CeuI. (B) I-CeuI cleavage map of the
RKS4594 genome based on (A). The genome is circular; here it is shown as a linear map for the convenience of illustrating the
mapping procedure. Only parts of fragment A (2512 kb) are shown at the ends of the linear map. The remaining 6 fragments
are drawn to scale.

AvrII cleavages and locate genes on the genome of S. paratyphi C, we transferred the transposon Tn10 that was
inserted in known genes in S. typhimurium LT2 [36] to the
S. paratyphi C background by bacteriophage P22 mediated
transduction as previously described [19], but with the
introduction of O12 antigen-encoding genes to make S.
paratyphi C sensitive to P22 (details provided in Materials
and Methods). Since the Tn10 sequence contains both
XbaI and AvrII cleavage sites [37], the location of a Tn10
insertion can be determined by XbaI or AvrII cleavage and
PFGE analyses. DNA from a strain with a Tn10 insertion
in a specific fragment will lose that fragment, and two
fragments will be detected that sum to the size of the lost
fragment plus 9.3 kb, which is the size of Tn10. We determined locations for 66 genes, as shown in Figure 3.

A high resolution genome map of S. paratyphi C RKS4594
After summarizing experimental results obtained by
cleavages with I-CeuI, XbaI and AvrII, Tn10 insertion analyses and double digestions (technical details described
previously [36]), we constructed a high resolution
genome map for S. paratyphi C RKS4594 (Figure 3). XbaI
fragment P (55 kb) was not mapped on the chromosome;
it is a plasmid (pSPC on Figure 2A and 2B) with a copy
number of 3 to 5 as judged by brightness of the DNA band
when compared with other bands on a PFGE gel. In addition to an XbaI cleavage site, this plasmid also has an AvrII
site (See Figure 2B; the plasmid band migrates together
with the 60 kb AvrII fragment Q). Most genes are in the
same order as in S. typhimurium LT2, with the following
exceptions. The translocation of I-CeuI fragment F moves

Genome map of S. paratyphi C RKS4594
Genome map of S. paratyphi C RKS4594. The sizes of cleavage fragments on the map are shown to scale, and are listed in
Figs 1 and 2. Solid rectangles indicate insertions (Ins1–4) and open rectangles indicate deletions (Del1–7), numbered clockwise,
relative to S. typhimurium LT2; the sizes are roughly to scale. The gene thrL is taken as the beginning of the map for the convenience of comparison with other Salmonella maps. The double-headed arrow, with one end being between pncB (at 1061 kb) and
purG (at 1127 kb) and the other between pepN (at 2729 kb) and nadB (at 2783 kb), covers the region of inversion with respect
to the chromosome of S. typhimurium LT2.

the thiC gene (and all other genes between rrnB and rrnE,
data not shown here) to a new location; a very large inversion (estimated as 1602 kb) includes purG (at 1127 kb on
the map) and pepN (at 2729 kb on the map). On the
genome of S. typhimurium LT2, the region clockwise to
pncB (which, at 1061 kb in S. paratyphi C, is just outside
the inverted region) is occupied by prophage Gifsy-2 (45
kb in size), and the region counterclockwise to nadB
(which, at 2783 kb in S. paratyphi C, is just outside the
inverted region at the other end of the 1602 kb inversion)

is occupied by prophage Gifsy-1 (48 kb). The distance
between pncB and purG (66 kb) plus that between pepN
and nadB (54 kb) in S. paratyphi C RKS4594 (total 120 kb)
roughly equals the distance between pncB and pepN (47
kb) plus that between purG and nadB (72 kb) in S. typhimurium LT2 (total 119 kb). So, judged by the distances
between genes, it seems that two prophages with sizes
similar to those of Gifsy-2 and Gifsy-1 are present in S.
paratyphi C RKS4594, although their identities are
unknown. Because the inversion seems to include most

Page 5 of 10

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:290

genes of the two prophages, and because the prophages
are inverted in orientation in S. typhimurium LT2, we speculate that the exchange points of the inversion were
between genes in the two prophages. At the position of
Gifsy-2 in S. typhimurium LT2, S. typhi CT18 has a different
phage sequence, but at the position of Gifsy-1 in S. typhimurium LT2, S. typhi CT18 does not have a phage
sequence [9,10]. A similar inversion has not been
observed in other Salmonella serovars.
There are several genomic regions with increased distances between genes relative to S. typhimurium LT2,
which we speculate to be DNA segments acquired from
foreign sources during the evolution of S. paratyphi C. The
first (Ins1) is 35 kb between purG and guaA, and the second (Ins2) is 39 kb between purC and purF. It is possible
that both are prophages as judged by their sizes, or that
one or both might be summations of smaller insertions in
those regions from different sources. A 12 kb genomic
increase (Ins3) was located in the region between cheA
and dadX. In this region, there is a 50 kb phage-associated
DNA segment in S. typhi CT18 but not in S. typhimurium
LT2 [9,10]. It is not known whether the 12 kb is part of the
50 kb phage DNA or whether the whole 50 kb phage DNA
is here and there is a 38 kb deletion, collectively giving rise
to a net 12 kb increase of DNA in that region.
The largest insertion is the one between melR and mutL,
about 90 kb, in a location similar to that of SPI7 in S. typhi
[9,14,15]. As it is previously known that the genome of S.
paratyphi C carries a shorter version of SPI7 [29], we
assume that this 90 kb insertion probably is the S. paratyphi C version of SPI7.
We also located genomic regions of reduced distances
(possible deletions) between genes in S. paratyphi C
RKS4594 when compared with S. typhimurium LT2. Starting from the gene thr and moving clockwise, the first possible deletion is one about 15 kb between ahpC and nadA
and the second one is about 14 kb between bioA and aroA.
Whether they contain single deletions or several smaller
deletions would both be interesting, especially regarding
the gene loss involved, as the absence of some of the genes
may be associated with host restriction.
The distance between aroD and pyrF is 362 kb in S. typhimurium LT2 but only 347 kb in S. paratyphi C RKS4594.
In the same region on the genome of S. typhi CT18, there
is a 34 kb phage-associated DNA sequence. Depending on
whether S. paratyphi C RKS4594 contains this 34 kb phage
DNA, this organism has a deletion of 15 kb or 49 kb in
this region relative to S. typhimurium LT2.
S. typhimurium LT2 has prophage Fels-2 (35 kb) between
genes tyrA and tctE. In this region, S. paratyphi C RKS4594

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/290

is 65 kb shorter compared to S. typhimurium LT2. If Fels-2
is not present, there should be another 30 kb deletion in
S. paratyphi C RKS4594. Three additional regions of possible deletions of 17 kb (between lysA and pepP), 20 kb
(between mutL and argI) and 19 kb (between pepP and
serB) need further characterization. Although we do not
completely rule out the possibility that the reduced distances between genes actually resulted from translocation
of DNA segments instead of deletions, it is very unlikely,
as gene order is highly conserved in Salmonella and DNA
translocation does not generally occur except those mediated by recombination of rrn genes or other repeated elements.
Plastic genome structure of S. paratyphi C
To determine whether the genome structure of S. paratyphi
C is uniform and stable among the populations like that
of S. paratyphi A [17], or is diverse and plastic like that of
S. typhi [15,16,35], we made I-CeuI maps on S. paratyphi
C isolates gathered from different geographical areas over
a broad range of time. As shown in Figure 4A, individual
S. paratyphi C strains have obviously different PFGE patterns, especially regarding the partial cleavage bands,
which reflect different orders of the genomic DNA segments (Figure 4B).

Rather strikingly, two strains, RKS4589 and RKS4590,
have a 20 kb deletion in a region between rrlA and rrlB.
This region is extremely stable in Salmonella and no deletion has been reported in other Salmonella lineages. Currently, we do not know what genes have been deleted in
these two strains and whether they have identical deletions.

Discussion
The existence of different typhoid agents causing very similar clinical manifestations presents exceptional opportunities for elucidating their origin(s) and for understanding
the molecular mechanisms of host adaptability. Two of
the four human typhoid agents, S. typhi and S. paratyphi A,
have been studied at the level of physical genome maps
with a focus on genome structure in large numbers of isolates [14-17,35] and at the level of whole genome
sequence with a focus on individual genes and their regulation in representative strains [9,11,12]. When compared
with S. typhimurium, S. typhi has over 600 unique genes
[9]. It is reasonable to speculate that some of the S. typhispecific genes may be directly involved in typhoid pathogenicity, although cooperation with genes of the "core Salmonella genome", i.e., genes shared by most Salmonella
lineages, should also be important. If one assumes that
the typhoid agents share some or many typhoid-associated genes, then comparisons among them should help in
identification. Comparative studies between S. typhi and
S. paratyphi A, however, are so far not conclusive, because

they each have many genomic features not shared by the
other. Therefore, it is necessary to compare more than two
Salmonella typhoidal lineages to further highlight some
possible common genomic features. Additionally, it is
also possible that some typhoid agents may have evolved
vertically from a common ancestor and others may have
acquired typhoid pathogenicity horizontally. Systematic
genome comparisons among multiple typhoid agents are
rational approaches toward elucidating these evolutionary processes.
The main purpose of this study was to reveal large scale
genomic features of a representative S. paratyphi C strain
and overall genome structure of S. paratyphi C populations. On the high resolution physical map of S. paratyphi
C RKS4594, we resolved four possible genomic insertions,
totaling 176 kb, and seven possible deletions, totaling
165 kb, relative to S. typhimurium LT2. At this stage, we do
not know what genes are contained in the insertions and
what genes are involved and deletions, but localization of
these insertions and deletions on the genome will significantly facilitate comparative studies among the typhoid
agents.
A basic feature of the genome structure of S. paratyphi C is
its plasticity – large genomic DNA segments are arranged
differently in different wild type strains. In strain
RKS4594, we first revealed two rearrangement events,
including inversion of a 1602 kb segment covering the ter
region and the translocation of the 43 kb I-CeuI F fragment from its location between I-CeuI E and G as in S.
typhimurium and most other Salmonella genomes to the
location between I-CeuI C and D, leading to the order ICeuI ABCFDEG in S. paratyphi C (Figure 3). Diverse
genome structures among the S. paratyphi C wild type
strains representing different populations have resulted
from homologous recombination between rrn genes in all
analyzed strains except RKS4587, in which a very rare
inversion occurred between a site in I-CeuI fragment B
and a site in I-CeuI fragment C; we are now determining
the exact locations and identities of the exchange end
points (Liu, on-going project).
The previously analyzed typhoid agents have different situations regarding the stability of genome structure. We
first reported the rearranged genome structure of S. typhi
Ty2 [14,15] and then found that wild type strains of S.
typhi representing different populations have diverse
genome structures; we called this phenomenon "genomic
plasticity" [16,34]. Our interpretation of this phenomenon is that large insertions disrupt the physical balance of
the genome between ori and ter, and rearrangements will
rebalance the genome [35]. In contrast, the other extensively investigated typhoid agent, S. paratyphi A, at both
physical map and sequence levels, has a uniform genome

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/290

structure among different isolates, even though this
organism does have insertions totaling 100 kb clustered
together on the genome. Interestingly, the 2400 kb inversion, seen in all examined wild type strains of S. paratyphi
A, nearly completely restored the genomic balance [17],
making it unnecessary for the bacteria to further rearrange
the genome. The situation with S. paratyphi B, on the other
hand, seems much more complex, because, unlike S.
typhi, S. paratyphi A or S. paratyphi C, which are all monophyletic [4,14,15,23], bacteria under the name S. paratyphi
B seem to be genetically diverse. For example, the d-tartrate-positive subline (strains that ferment d-tartrate)
causes gastroenteritis instead of typhoid. Kauffmann proposed the name S. java for this subline [38], however Le
Minor et al. proposed that the name S. java be dropped
[39]. Even within the d-tartrate-negative and typhoidcausing subline, the diversity in genome structure, as
reflected by XbaI and AvrII cleavage patterns, is also significant [20]. Genome sequencing of a representative
typhoid-causing strain(s) of S. paratyphi B followed by
population analysis will provide insights into the phylogenetics and evolution of S. paratyphi B as a typhoid agent.
This study demonstrates that S. paratyphi C is similar to S.
typhi in the plasticity of genome structure. However, such
a similarity is not indicative of their relatedness. Instead,
this similarity suggests a similar route of evolution: acquisition of typhoid causing genes, disruption of physical
balance of the genome, and rearrangement of the genome
to restore the balance. This route may apply to S. paratyphi
A as well: the non-plastic feature of its genome may be
merely a result of the near complete restoration of the
genome balance by the 2400 kb inversion. It is not known
at present whether S. paratyphi B, monophyletic or
polyphyletic as it may turn out to be, has a stable or plastic
genome structure; however, it may too have followed a
similar route of pathogenic evolution. Revelation of genes
that contribute to the typhoid pathogenesis in the individual typhoid agents will update our knowledge on pathogenically similar but phylogenetically not directly related
bacteria. For achieving this goal, sequencing of additional
Salmonella typhoid agents is currently underway in several
institutions, and some of the sequencing projects are close
to or already at the finishing stages.
This study also revealed an unusual feature of S. paratyphi
C: unlike S. typhi wild type strains that do not have significant DNA content differences except SPI7 that is missing
from some S. typhi isolates [27], two S. paratyphi C strains
in this study have 20 kb deletions in a normally extremely
stable genomic region between rrlA and rrlB (Figure 4).
This finding suggests that genes in the deleted 20 kb DNA
are no longer needed at least in some S. paratyphi C
strains, or they are not needed by any of the typhoid
agents in general. It is possible that, considering the short

evolutionary history of the Salmonella typhoid agents
[40,41], these bacteria may have not yet eliminated all of
the non-selected genes, although some stochastic factors,
such as integration or excision of prophages that make
genomic rebalancing necessary, may have worked to help
streamline the genome by removing some of the presumably unneeded genes before they even had a chance to
become pseudogenes. These findings may help prioritize
genes for functional analyses by excluding large numbers
of genes from further study.

Conclusion
S. paratyphi C has diverse genome structures, possibly as a
result of large genomic insertions, e.g., SPI7. Although the
Salmonella typhoid agents may not be more closely related
among them than each of them to other Salmonella lineages, they may have evolved in similar ways, i.e., acquiring
typhoid-associated genes and making genome structure
rearrangements. Comparison of multiple Salmonella
typhoid agents at both single sequenced genome and population levels will facilitate the studies on the evolutionary process of typhoid pathogenesis, especially the
identification of typhoid-associated genes.

pPR1347 [42] carrying the genes coding for the long chain
O antigen into S. paratyphi C RKS4594 to make it sensitive
to P22. The P22 transduction experiments have been
described previously [19]. Briefly, we made P22 lysates
from a selected set of Tn10 insertion mutants of S. typhimurium LT2 by growing a 3 ml overnight culture in LB
broth of these selected Tn10 mutants and inoculating
these cultures with phage P22 at a multiplicity of infection
of 1:100, followed by co-incubation for 6 hours. After
removal of the cell debris by centrifugation, the lysates,
which contained approximately 1011pfu/ml of phage particles, were ready for use in the transduction. For transferring the Tn10 insertions to S. paratyphi C, we spread 100
µl overnight culture of S. paratyphi C carrying pPR1347
and 10 µl lysate onto an LB plate containing tetracycline.
A colony was picked up and re-streaked on another tetracycline plate for single colony isolation. One colony from
the second tetracycline plate was used for phenotype tests
and mapping.

Transfer of Tn10 insertions through bacteriophage P22
mediated transduction
A large number of Tn10 insertions into genes with known
functions have been established in S. typhimurium LT2 in
a great range of laboratories. We transferred Tn10 insertions from S. typhimurium LT2 to S. paratyphi C by bacteriophage P22 mediated transduction to locate these genes
through homologous recombination. As P22 infects only
Salmonella serovars that express O12 antigen but S. paratyphi C does not have O12, we transferred the cosmid
