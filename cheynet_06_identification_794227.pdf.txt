Abstract
The cellular HERV-W envelope/syncytin-1 protein, encoded by the envelope gene of the ERVWE1
proviral locus is a fusogenic glycoprotein probably involved in the formation of the placental
syncytiotrophoblast layer. Syncytin-1-induced in vitro cell-cell fusion is dependent on the interaction
with hASCT2. As no receptor binding domain has been clearly defined in the SU of neither the
HERV-W Env nor the retroviruses of the same interference group, we designed an in vitro binding
assay to evaluate the interaction of the HERV-W envelope with the hASCT2 receptor. Using
truncated HERV-W SU subunits, a region consisting of the N-terminal 124 amino acids of the
mature SU glycoprotein was determined as the minimal receptor-binding domain. This domain
contains several sub-domains which are poorly conserved among retroviruses of this interference
group but a region of 18 residus containing the SDGGGX2DX2R conserved motif was proved to
be essential for syncytin-1-hASCT2 interaction.

Findings
The cellular HERV-W envelope protein, also named syncytin-1, is a fusogenic glycoprotein probably involved in the
formation of the placental syncytiotrophoblast layer [13]. This protein, encoded by the envelope gene of the
ERVWE1 proviral locus [4] is synthesized as a gPr73 precursor and is specifically cleaved into two mature proteins, a gp50 surface subunit (SU) and a gp24
transmembrane subunit (TM) [5]. The HERV-W Env glycoprotein is phylogenetically related to an interference
group of retroviruses [6] that includes feline endogenous
virus (RD114), baboon endogenous virus (BaEV), simian
retroviruses (SRV-1, SRV-2), avian reticuloendotheliosis
viruses (REV-A) and spleen necrosis virus (SNV) [7]. All
retroviruses of this group share a common cell surface
receptor, the human sodium-dependent neutral amino
acid transporter type 2 (hASCT2) [8,9]. Accordingly, syn-

cytin-1-induced in vitro cell-cell fusion is dependent upon
interaction with hASCT2 [1] and also with the amino acid
transporter hASCT1 [10]. Moreover, HERV-W Env confers
host cell resistance to infection by SNV [11]. To date, no
RBD has been clearly defined in the SU of the HERV-W
Env interference group. Within the type C mammalian retroviruses, the SU subunit harbors three contiguous
regions consisting of the SU amino-terminal receptor
binding globular domain [12-14], a proline-rich region
(PRR) and the TM-interacting SU carboxy-terminal
domain. A similar RBD has been also delineated in the SU
N-terminal region of HTLV1, HTLV2 [15,16] and predicted in Mammary Tumor Virus [17] and Bovine Leukemia virus envelopes [18].
In this study, we have designed an in vitro binding assay to
evaluate the interaction of HERV-W envelope-derived sol-

uble SU domains with the hASCT2 receptor. We have
identified a 124 residue region of the mature SU as the
minimal domain that interacts with the hASCT2 receptor.
The HERV-W soluble SU subunit was constructed,
expressed and tested as follows. Firstly, we used the
phCMV-EnvW (clonePH74) expression vector containing
the complete env gene as a template to generate soluble
gp50 protein. In order to produce a soluble tagged gp50
protein, a full-length domain (phCMV-EnvSU) was constructed as a fusion protein containing a C-terminal
VHRGS(H6) sequence located just downstream from the
RNKR cleavage site replaced with an AAAR sequence (Figure 1A). Secondly, Env protein was recovered from cell
culture medium without serum after transient expression
in HEK293T cells. Finally, the binding assay using the soluble SU subunit was performed as previously described by
Lavillette [19]. Briefly, target cells expressing the relevant
receptor(s) were incubated with the supernatant containing the soluble envelope. The cells were stained with antihistidine antibody (anti-RGS(H4) Mab; Qiagen) to detect
soluble SU and analyzed by a fluorescence-activated cell
sorter (FACS Calibur, Becton Dickinson).
In order to verify that the soluble SU protein behaves similarly to the SU subunit within the context of the native
syncytin-1, we first examined the interaction of SU protein
with hASCT2 receptor using parental and receptorblocked TE671 human cells as target cells (Figure 1B).
Indeed, TE671 cells were originally used to demonstrate
the fusogenic properties of the native syncytin-1 protein.
The target cells were TE671 subclones stably expressing
the envelope glycoproteins derived from the GALV and
RD114 retroviruses that respectively recognize the PiT-1
[20] and hASCT2 (also named RDR for type D mammalian retrovirus receptor) [8,9] receptors, thus blocking the
accessibility of exogenously presented retroviral envelopes to these receptors, as previously described [1]. As
expected, the soluble SU protein bound to TE671 parental
cells, which express the receptors for several retrovirus
groups, to PiT1-blocked cells, but not to hASCT2-blocked
cells. These data confirmed that soluble SU protein, similarly to syncytin-1, recognizes the type D mammalian retrovirus receptor expressed on human cells and thus
behaves like retroviral glycoproteins of the interference
group.
To infer the sensitivity and specificity of the cell surface
binding assay, soluble SU subunit was bound to a panel
of target cell types expressing different combinations of
hASCT1 and hASCT2 receptors: TE671 cells which contain
hASCT1 and hASCT2 [10], HeLa cells which contain
hASCT2 but not hASCT1 [21], HEK293T cells which contain small amounts of both hASCT1 and hASCT2 [22],
and XC rat cell clones stably expressing either hASCT2 or

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/41

hASCT1 human receptors and derived from XC cells by
transfection of the pCD3.1VHR16/14 [9] and pCDNA3.1hASCT1 [10] expression plasmids, respectively (Figure
1C). In this assay, binding to HeLa cells was slightly
higher than to TE671 cells, demonstrating the different
expression and/or distribution of the hASCT2 receptor on
these target cells. In contrast, the HEK293T cells weakly
bound SU protein. Using XC-hASCT1 and XC-hASCT2
cells (Figure 1C), we showed that the SU subunit could
efficiently bind both to hASCT1 and hASCT2 receptors, as
observed for both cell-cell fusion and infection assays
[10].
Finally to exclude any potential binding of soluble SU
onto non-human ASCT-related receptor expressed by
parental XC cells, we compare the binding efficiency of SU
between parental XC cells and XC-hASCT2 or XC-hASCT1
cells (Figure 1D). As expected, the SU protein bound to
XChASCT2 and XChASCT1 cells but not XC parental cells
[1].
As the features of the SU recombinant protein have been
shown to be similar to the native syncytin-1 protein, we
designed a series of N- and C-terminal truncation mutants
in order to identify the RBD of syncytin-1 (Figure 2A). SU
versus truncated SU-derived proteins were tested for their
ability to bind hASCT2 receptor-presenting cells (XChASCT2) by flow cytometry and XC parental cells were
used as a control. Domains of the SU subunit were generated by PCR, subcloned into the phCMV-EnvSU expression vector and sequenced. EnvSU, Env69–313, Env233,
Env197 and Env168 proteins were expressed in transfected HEK293T cells and the expression level evaluated
by Western blot analysis (Figure 2B). EnvSU, Env233,
Env197 were expressed, secreted into the cell culture
medium and exhibited similar binding efficiencies (Figure 2C), demonstrating that the N-terminal 176 residues
of the mature SU are sufficient for hASCT2 recognition.
Interestingly, deletion of the 22–68 region leads to the
loss of receptor recognition, also suggesting its implication in the RBD. The Env168 mutant was poorly detected
in the supernatant, suggesting problems of expression,
secretion and/or stability for this truncated protein. Nevertheless, it still showed a weak binding capacity. Thus, in
order to obtain similar quantities of soluble recombinant
proteins derived from smaller N-terminal regions, we
decided to fuse those N-terminal fragments with a carboxy-terminal domain (residues 169 to 313) of the SU
protein (Figure 2A) which is unable to bind receptor (see
below). A homogenous expression level of Env169–313,
Env71, Env95, Env117 and Env144 truncated envelopes
in cell culture supernatants was confirmed by Western
blot analysis (Figure 2B). Only the Env144 protein bound
to its receptor (Figure 2C). In order to verify if the receptor
binding capacity of Env144 requires an interaction

between the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains of
this SU-derived construct, we substituted the 169–313
amino-acids in Env144 protein by an heterologous
sequence from EGF coding for 53 amino-acids. The binding of the fusion protein (Env144-EGF) was similar to that
observed for Env144, demonstrating that the carboxy-terminal part of the SU subunit does not contribute to receptor binding (data not shown).

syncytia containing one to ten blue nuclei, as previously
observed [1] (Figure 3A). Conversely, expression of
EnvSU in HEK293T lead to a decrease in syncytia formation characterized by about 270 syncytia per well and an
average of 25 ± 12 nuclei per syncytia containing two to
ten blue nuclei, indicating that wild-type envelope could
not efficiently interact with hASCT2 receptors on
HEK293T cells. Env144 protein expression induces a
decrease in fusogenic activity similar to the total SU
domain (240 syncytia per well, 26 ± 9 nuclei per syncytia).
Conversely, a non-receptor binding protein such as Env71
did not alter fusion efficiency (680 syncytia per well, 66 ±
35 nuclei per syncytia). This demonstrated that the
Env144 protein contains all determinants required for
hASCT2 receptor binding. In addition, the binding of
Env144 and EnvSU to the hASCT1 receptor was found to
be similar (data not shown).

To formally identify the Env144 protein as a functional
RBD product we have evaluated its properties to compete
with the wild-type envelope during receptor recognition,
using an heterologous cell-cell fusion assay [1,5]. Briefly,
TELCeB6 indicator cells expressing the wild-type envelope
and characterized by a nucleus expressing β-galactosidase
were co-cultured with HEK293T indicator target cells,
characterized by uncolored nuclei. The co-culture of both
indicator and producer cells leads to the formation of syncytia containing generally one or several blue nucleus and
tens white nuclei. The expression in HEK293T of any SU
subdomain exhibiting RBD properties would reduce syncytia formation by a receptor interference mechanism.
The fusion positive control was characterized by about
730 syncytia per well and an average of 77 ± 42 nuclei per

The absence of binding in cell surface assays using Env71,
Env95 and notably Env117 protein (Figure 2C) suggested
the loss of at least one receptor-binding determinant
within the 117–144 region. This region contains the
epitope of an anti-SU polyclonal antibody (anti-SU raised
against residues 112–129 of EnvW) [5]. This antibody was

Validation of RBD functionality
Validation of RBD functionality. A) Cell-cell fusion inhibition by the RBD. The wild-type HERV-W plasmid was transfected
in TELCeB6 wild-type envelope producer cells phenotypically characterized by a nucleus expressing β-galactosidase. The
HEK293T indicator target cells were transfected with antisense env gene (fusion control), Env71 (non-binding domain), Env144
(RBD) and EnvSU (inhibition control) plasmids. Producer cells were overlaid with HEK293T indicator cells transiently transfected with truncation mutants. Coculture were stained with X-Gal substrate then with May-Grünwald and Giemsa solutions.
The determination of the fusion activity of the transfected envelope was performed after 20 h of coculture. The total number
of syncytia in one well and the number of nuclei in each syncytia were determined. B) Binding inhibition by an anti-RBD antibody. The Env 144 protein was pre-incubated at 37°C for 1 h with the anti-SU and anti-TM antibodies (dotted line) [5]. Then,
XC-hASCT2 cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 h with the protein-antibody complex. The shaded histogram (Env144 incubated with XC-hASCT2) and white histogram (Env144 incubated with parental XC cells) were indicated as controls. The binding was analyzed by flow cytometry with an anti-histidine antibody (anti-RGS(H4)-Mab; Qiagen). C) Receptor binding domain.
Variable amino acids (aa) (green dot) among hominoids (upper-case), human (lower case) and neutral insertions preserving the
envelope functions (white dots) are indicated above the sequence [23]. Strictly conserved aa (grey boxes) and similar aa
(straight line) within the D interference group are underlined. Mutations altering spleen necrosis virus infectivity are indicated
as black dots [24]. Blue arrows covering aa 21–69 and 117–144 indicate deletions detrimental to hASCT2 binding. The red
arrow corresponds to the SU-EnvW peptide used for rabbit immunization and affinity purification [5].

used to detect native syncytin-1 in primary cytotrophoblasts [3] and in b30BeWo carcinoma cells [5]. Hence, the
Env144 protein was pre-incubated with the anti-SU antibody. The binding of the protein-antibody complex onto
the receptor was significantly altered in the presence of the
specific anti-SU antibody but not in the presence of a rabbit anti-TM antibody (Figure 3B). This result indicates that
this domain is essential for hASCT2 receptor binding.

In conclusion, we have used HERV-W SU soluble subunits
to determine that the 124 N-terminal amino-acids of the
HERV-W mature SU protein are sufficient to interact with
the hASCT2 and hASCT1 amino-acid transporters (Figure
3C). Although still not elucidated, the envelope-receptor
interaction seems to some extent to be tolerant of the RBD
amino acid content. Thus, 17 positions out of the 124 residues of the RBD were shown to be variable in ERVWE1
envelopes of hominoids and humans, without altering
the hASCT2-dependent fusogenic properties of each envelope variant [4]. In addition, a weak sequence conservation exists between retroviral members of the interference
group with the notable exception of three cysteine-containing motifs (PCXC, CYX5C and CX8–9CW) and a
SDGGGX2DX2R motif. Interestingly, it was shown previously that introduction of 5 residues downstream from
serine 51 (see Figure 3C) preserves the fusogenicity of the
syncytin-1 protein [23]. This suggests that the first 30 aa of
the RBD, that include the conserved PCXC motif, constitute an actual sub-domain. It should be noted that regions
of variable sizes are observed between the CYX5C and
CX8–9CW motifs of the retroviruses of the interference
group, which suggests a certain flexibility of the interdomain. In addition, the conserved SDGGGX2DX2R motif
seems to be directly involved in receptor interaction, as
supported by receptor-binding inhibition with a regioselective antibody and receptor recognition alteration due
to aspartic acid mutated residues in SNV-related retrovirus
[24]. Lastly, the carboxy-terminal end of the RBD presents
a conserved predicted alpha-helix located immediately
upstream of the SDGGGX2D sequence. Taken together,
these results suggest, for all the retroviruses of the interference group, the existence of 5 structurally or sequenceconserved sub-domains. Crystallography studies will be
required to confirm that these sub-domains interact.
Finally, as the syncytin-1 belongs to the HERV-W family,
many natural HERV-W truncated envelope ORFs probably
contain the RBD. When reactivated, these partial envelopes could interfere with the hASCT receptors, which suggests putative physiopathological functions for such
truncated envelopes.
