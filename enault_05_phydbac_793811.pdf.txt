Abstract
Background: The large amount of completely sequenced genomes allows genomic context
analysis to predict reliable functional associations between prokaryotic proteins. Major methods
rely on the fact that genes encoding physically interacting partners or members of shared metabolic
pathways tend to be proximate on the genome, to evolve in a correlated manner and to be fused
as a single sequence in another organism.
Results: The new "Gene Function Predictor", linked to the web server Phydbac proposes putative
associations between Escherichia coli K-12 proteins derived from a combination of these methods.
We show that associations made by this tool are more accurate than linkages found in the other
established databases. Predicted assignments to GO categories, based on pre-existing functional
annotations of associated proteins are also available. This new database currently holds 9,379
pairwise links at an expected success rate of at least 80%, the 6,466 functional predictions to GO
terms derived from these links having a level of accuracy higher than 70%.
Conclusion: The "Gene Function Predictor" is an automatic tool that aims to help biologists by
providing them hypothetical functional predictions out of genomic context characteristics. The
"Gene Function predictor" is available at http://www.igs.cnrs-mrs.fr/phydbac/indexPS.html.

Background
Annotating proteins of unknown biological function is
still a major bottleneck in the exploitation of genomic
information. The main approaches are all based on the
recognition of sequence similarity, from which functional
homology is inferred with various levels of confidence.
Methods such as BLAST, PSI-BLAST [1] or Pfam [2] are
used to automatically generate functional annotations to
a sizable fraction of the genes in newly sequenced
genomes. However, from 20% to 50% of genes [3] are still
annotated as being of unknown function, either because
they have no statistically significant matches in current
databases or because they only match uncharacterized

protein sequences from other organisms. To provide putative functional assignments to those proteins, comparative genomic approaches are now reaching beyond the
simple recognition of sequence similarity [4-6]. The reliability of these new methods, often referred to as genome
context analysis, is now steadily improving, due to the
almost exponential increase in the number of fully
sequenced genomes. They allow the detection of functionally linked proteins, either physically interacting partners
or members of shared metabolic pathways or cellular
processes. The functional association of proteins may
cause their encoding genes (i) to be part of a shared transcriptonal unit (Operon or Gene Cluster method), [7-9]

or to exhibit a chromosomal proximity conserved in several genomes (Gene Neighbor method) [10,11], (ii) to
have evolved in a correlated manner (Phylogenetic Profiles method) [12] or (iii) to have fused as a single gene in
another organism (Rosetta Stone method) [13,14].
Here we introduce the new "Gene Function Predictor" of
our web software Phydbac [15] based on the results given
by a combination of these non-homology based methods.
This database proposes putative associations between
Escherichia coli K-12 proteins as well as functional GO
term predictions derived from these associations. A blast
mode is also available to apply the method to any protein
sequence. In this study, we first describe separate improvements to the three major genomic context methods. An
integrated score combining their results is defined and
shown to predict protein pairwise associations more accurately than the ones already proposed in established databases such as Predictome [16], Prolinks [17] and String
[18]. We then take advantage of the pre-existing functional annotations of the putatively associated proteins to
assign them to GO categories [19]. The "Gene Function
Predictor" proved to be particularly useful for the «conserved hypothetical protein» subset, as shown on a specific example.

Implementation
This web tool is designed as a CGI script written in Perl
running on an Apache web server. This script first retrieves
genes through the process of the information entered into
a HTML Form. A target gene can either be retrieved by its
name or by the presence of a keyword in its annotation.
The putative associations and functional predictions are
then extracted by running a number of Perl scripts on a
database of pre-computed blast hits and auxiliary information. Results for the query are then displayed through
HTML pages. The "Gene Function Predictor" is accessible
through any browser.

Results and discussion
Data sources and scoring
In this study, genomic context analysis is applied to the
well annotated bacterium Escherichia coli K-12 (Figure 1).
This analysis is performed using the 150 completely
sequenced organisms available in Refseq, including 130
bacteria, 17 archaeal bacteria and 3 unicellular eukaryota.
E. coli protein associations available in Phydbac's "Gene
Function Predictor" are generated by three genomic methods : the phylogenetic profile, the colocalization and the
Rosetta Stone methods. Improvements to these different
methods and their implementation are described in the
following.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/247

Consensus phylogenetic profiles (P)
It is established that proteins evolving in a correlated
manner tend to participate in common metabolic pathways or constitute multi-molecular complexes. Using the
simplest type of phylogenetic profile, the co-occurrence of
genes is represented by a string of bits, each bit recording
the presence or absence of an ortholog to a given gene in
a genome [12]. In an earlier work [20], we proposed to
replace this binary scale by continuous values derived
from alignment scores.

Let Sab be the best Blastp bit score between a target protein
a and all proteins of a bacteria b and saa the self-score of
the a protein aligned with itself. Each point of the phylogenetic profile of a protein a is computed as : Rab = Sab/saa.
Each point of a profile is weighed proportionally to the
length and quality of the corresponding alignment.
Although this method was shown to improve on the
binary method of Pellegrini et al. [12], the profiles are
noisy. As we want no orthologs to be missed, even low
sequence similarities are considered, bringing back a certain amount of false positives.
To improve their quality, profiles now use the information contained in the profiles of genes from other species.
Introduced as a display feature in our web software Phydbac [15], Consensus Phylogenetic Profiles (CPP) are built
from the profiles of a target gene and of its putative
orthologs. The CPP of a gene has a non-zero score in a
given column (corresponding to a bacterium) if more
than half of its best matches in the other species has a
match in this bacterium. The score of the profile for this
column will then be the mean of the non-zero scores of
the different putative orthologs with the corresponding
bacteria. Figure 2 shows the profile of E. coli protein phoR,
the ones of its best homologs in different organisms and
the CPP of phoR built out of all those profiles. We note
that the CPP of phoR is similar to its simple profile except
at the columns corresponding to the two Neisseria meningitidis strains. Unlike phoR for which low sequence similarity matches are found in these strains, its best homologs
do not exhibit any matches in these two organisms, suggesting that no orthologs of phoR are present in them.
From the CPP of the 4271 protein coding genes of E. coli,
a pairwise P score is then computed. The P score is a correlation coefficient computed without the mean between
each pair of profiles, profiles being N-dimensional vectors, with N the number of sequenced genomes (here N =
150). The profiles are stored in a matrix R where Rik is the
value of the gene i profile at the column k corresponding
to bacteria k. The score Pij reflecting the coevolution level
between two genes i and j is then given by :

E. coli are compared to the ORFs of 150 genomes. (A) The P score applied to E. coli protein phylogenetic profiles allows to
identify protein pairs that evolved in a similar manner. For example, genes A and E are present in genomes 1, 2 and 150 and
absent in genome 3. (B) The C score is associated to gene pairs nearby in, at least, one genome. This score is computed from
the intergenic distances between E. coli genes and their respective homologs in all other genomes. The genes B and F (respectively red and green) are found only separated by 30 bp in genome 1 and by 5 bp in genome 3, resulting in a C score of 0.8
between those two genes. (C) The F score is computed for each domain fusion detected. In the example, domains of E. coli
genes C and D are found fused in a gene of genome 3. (D) Significant P, C and F scores are combined in an integrated score. (E)
Functional predictions are made out of the annotations of associated partners.

Pairs of gene products exhibiting the highest P scores are
the most likely to be functionally linked.
Detection of co-localizations (C)
The identification of pairs of genes part of the same
operon in a genome can also lead to their functional associations. Indeed, genes organized into operons, i.e. genes
transcribed into a single mRNA, are co-regulated and tend
to fill related roles in cellular processes of the organism.
Such genes are identified either by using intergenic distances separating genes [8], by analyzing conserved chromosomal adjacency between genes in a set of genomes [911] or more recently by combining these two sources of
information [21]. Because the assumption that genes separated by small intergenic distances are likely to belong to
a shared operon is true in all prokaryotic organisms
[8,22], the intergenic distances in all the genomes are
more informative than conserved chromosomal adjacencies. Our score C is based on intergenic distances separat-

ing colocalized gene pairs across all the genomes. Two
genes are said to be colocalized in a genome if these two
genes and the genes between them on the chromosome
are on the same strand and if all adjacent gene pairs of the
string are separated by less than 300 bp [11]. In E. coli,
more than 98% of the gene pairs being on an operon
described in RegulonDB [23] are separated by less than
this threshold of 300 bp. The distance associated to a colocalized gene pair is the maximal intergenic distance found
between them. For example, for three adjacent genes A, B
and C on the same strand, if A and B are separated by 5 bp
and B and C by 75 bp, we consider A and C to be colocalized with a distance of 75 bp.
To avoid artefacts due to the presence of redundant strains
and of evolutionary close species in the 150 genomes, we
restrict our analysis to 87 groups of similar organisms,
made on the basis of the multiple alignments of the 150
homologs of three conserved genes [15]. A pair of genes
found colocalized in Xanthomonas campestris and in the
two Xylella fastidiosa strains will only be considered as
colocalized in the group containing these organisms, the
minimal distance separating this couple in a genome of
this group being recorded.
The colocalization score C reflects the degree of confidence in the fact that genes are colocalized because of

BMC Bioinformatics 2005, 6:247

functional relationships, ie that genes are part of an
operon in a genome. The score between each gene i and j
of a target genome is :
2

 dij ( g)  
−
 

 200  

e
Cij = 1 − ∏  1 −

2
∀g∈Gij 





where Gij are the groups of genomes where i and j are
colocalized and dij(g) the minimal distance in base pairs
that separates i and j in a genome of the group g. The definition of C was derived from observed characteristics of
colocalized genes. A colocalization score between two
genes must always increase as groups in which these genes
are co-localized are found. Our C score was built in order
to verify this point. Indeed, C is equal to 1 minus a product of elements, each element, involving an intergenic distance, being comprised between 0.5 and 1. To calculate
these elements, an exponential function is used because
the information gained from an intergenic distance must
not be proportional to the length of this distance. Different formulas were tested and this C definition is the one
that gives the better results.

In contrast to the Operon or Gene Cluster method, our
score C is able to detect gene pairs distant in E. coli that
form an operon in other organisms (like genes B and F in
Fig. 1). Unlike the Gene Neighbor method, it can detect
operons present in only one organism (like genes A and E
in Fig. 1). Of course, not all of the E. coli gene pairs are separated by less than 300 bp in at least one genome. Only
199,262 of the possible 9,118,580 gene couples of E. coli
are found separated by less than 300 bp in at least one
genome, with an average score C of 0.48. A C average of
0.87 is found when considering the 2219 pairs of genes
present in the same operon described in RegulonDB [23].
Identification of gene fusion events (F)
Associations of genes can also be deduced with the
Rosetta stone technique [13,14] by detecting gene fusion
events. Two distinct genes of a given organism that are
found fused as a continuous sequence (referred to as the
Rosetta Stone sequence) in another genome tend to physically interact. Non-homologous proteins fused as a single
sequence are identified with the aid of the Pfam protein
domain database [2]. Rpsblast of all the Pfam domains
against all the proteins of 150 genomes and E. coli were
computed, using a threshold of significance of 10e-10 for
the expectation value of the alignments. Two E. coli proteins are determined to be fused if at least one domain of
each protein is found separately in a third protein of
another organism. As domains are relatively short compared to protein sequences, we did not consider overlaps

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/247

larger than 10 residues between the alignments of the two
domains on the Rosetta Stone sequence. The presence of
two domains in different proteins as well as on the same
coding sequence is of course not enough to be sure that a
real fusion event took place between genes coding these
proteins. But as such domains are likely to be functionally
linked, it is also true for the proteins in which the domains
appear separately. A score F is deduced from the probability that two genes are found fused by chance in another
single sequence described in [17]. This score F depends on
the number of sequences with which the two domains
considered exhibit a significant sequence similarity and
the number of sequences in which these domains are
found fused. The score F is computed for each of the
22,100 E.coli protein pairs for which a putative domain
fusion is detected.
Evaluation and comparison between P, C and F and the
integrated score
As the three scores P, C and F are based on different concepts, they are supposed to be independent and to provide
different valuable information. To integrate them appropriately into a unique score, we have to scale them by their
respective accuracy to predict genes that are functionally
linked. As P, C and F are continuous scores, a list of ranked
significant associations given by each approach allows to
calculate the fraction of associations involving two genes
annotated in the same COG category among associations
linking COG-annotated genes [24].

This success rate also allows us to compare the quality of
each score (Figure 3). First of all, we note that the information on coevolution is better retrieved when Consensus
Profiles are used (P) compared to our previous simple
profiles (P old). The increase of accuracy between P and Pold is higher by more than 30% for any number of predicted pairs. C gives even better results than P, with
15,600 predictions with an accuracy higher than 0.5
(12,800 for P). 1,743 of the 2,219 gene pairs in shared
operons of RegulonDB [23] have a C score higher than the
threshold corresponding to an accuracy of 0.5. The score
F associates 5,500 different E. coli protein pairs with a success rate higher than 50%.
The success rate is used to establish normalized scores
across the different approaches. This normalization procedure then allows the individual scores to be merged into
an integrated score in a simple way :
Sij = 1 - [(1-Pij) × (1 - Cij) × (1 - Fij)]
where i and j are two genes and with Pij, Cij and Fij set to 0
when no significant score is found for i and j. The quality
of predictions made with this integrated score S is significantly better than each of P, C and F on their own (figure

than the score P and more than 60% better than the score
F alone. For an expected success rate of at least 80 %,
9,379 pairwise associations are derived from the S score,
involving 2,500 E. coli genes. A coverage of 70 % (2,975
of the 4,278 genes) is obtained when considering an accuracy of 70 %.
Comparative benchmarking of databases
There are three major databases of putative associations
between prokaryotic genes derived from genomic context
analysis : Predictome, String and Prolinks. Each one
implements different methods with personal flavours. In
Predictome [16], phylogenetic profiling, gene neighbor
and domain fusion are implemented in their traditional
way and applied to orthologous families of genes defined
in COG. One of its major limitation is the absence of a
quality score for each prediction. In the earlier releases of
String [25], genomic analysis was also relying on COGs. A
protein mode is now available, based on continuous phy-

logenetic profiling, gene neighbor, fusion, as well as
experimental data and literature mining [18]. Prolinks
[17] uses binary profiles not based on COG data. For pairwise alignments, the homology is considered significant if
the e-value associated is lower than 10e-10. Text mining,
gene fusion, gene neighbor as well as a gene cluster
method are also implemented. For each method, they
developed their own probabilistic score. Prolinks and
String scale the different methods separately and then
compute a confidence score.
To compare those three databases to Phydbac, the associations were downloaded from their respective web sites.
As the accuracy of the putative links given by each database is tested against Gene Ontology data [19], we only
keep associations involving GO-annotated genes. 18,760
different associations between GO-annotated genes are
found in Predictome, 57,266 in String and 59,260 in Prolinks. For each database, each target gene annotated in at
least a GO class has a certain number of GO-annotated
genes associated to it. We select the same number of our
best GO-annotated predictions involving this target gene
and determine which database has the best accuracy for
each gene (Figure 4). Associations given by our method
more often imply genes belonging to the same GO category than associations of other databases.
We can note that Predictome gives better results for only
10 % of the genes (74% for Phydbac). This point is not
surprising as the release of Predictome is the oldest of the
three databases. String is the database that gives the most
different results to ours (only 11% of genes having similar
results). As we have seen, additional information, different to genomic information, has recently been added and
the gene cluster method is not used. In figure 4, we note
that results of Phydbac are more accurate than those of
String for 54% of the 2,907 GO-annotated genes that have
at least one association in String. Our putative associations are also better than those found in Prolinks. For 46%
of the 3,137 GO-annotated genes of Prolinks, putative
associations predicted by Phydbac imply two genes of the
same GO category more often than those found in Prolinks. A surprising result described in the Prolinks paper
(Bowers et al. 2004) is the fact that the integration of their
5 methods do not give better results than their Gene
Neighbor method on its own. Their final score for a gene
couple is the maximum value found with the 5 methods.
As we have seen, the different methods are supposed to
give independent information, and although this is not
strictly true, a combination of the different scores (as in
String and Phydbac) works better.
Assignment to GO categories
In addition to putative associations, we developed an
annotation procedure meant to assign genes to Gene

Ontology categories [19]. GO provides structured classifications that cover several domains of molecular and cellular biology. Gene products are described throughout three
non-overlapping domains : (i) Molecular Function
describes activities at the molecular level, (ii) Biological
Process describes biological goals accomplished by one or
more molecular functions and (iii) Cellular Component
describes locations at the level of subcellular structures
and macromolecular complexes. GO can be viewed as a
directed acyclic graph that represents a network in which
each term may be a "child" of one or more "parents". For
example, the function term "peptidyl-serine ADP-ribosylation", from the biological process vocabulary, is a
child of both terms "protein amino acid ADP-ribosylation" and "peptidyl-serine modification".

In our annotation procedure, each term is considered as
an independent class. For a target gene and for a fixed
accuracy threshold for S, a certain number of genes are
potentially linked to the target, associated to a total of t
annotations. Each GO term A appears nA times in the t
annotations (cases where A is a parent of one of the t
annotations are also counted) and NA times in the total
pool of the T annotations of E. coli genes. The probability
to draw at least nA annotations of the GO term A or of
child terms of A by chance out of t annotation is given by :

P( A by chance) =

NA

BMC Bioinformatics 2005, 6:247

For each target gene, GO terms with a value for this probability lower than 10e-10 are considered as putative functional annotations. The same procedure is repeated for
decreasing accuracy thresholds of S.
Considering E. coli genes already annotated with GO
terms, 1,725 GO term predictions are derived from the
4,006 links with expected success rate of 90%. 80% of
these 1,725 predictions are correct, i.e. already appear in
the annotations of genes. Out of these 1,725 predictions,
the 974 best, corresponding to a probability lower than
10e–13, have an accuracy greater than 85 %. When using
links with an expected success rate of 80% (9,379 pairwise
links), 70% of the 6,466 functional predictions are correctly inferred. Of course, predicted GO terms that do not
appear in the gene's annotation cannot be considered systematically as false predictions. Annotated genes may
have additional – yet unknown – functions or predictions
may represent the gene function on another level. For
example, yaeT, annotated in GO term as an "outer membrane"protein, which describes its location, is predicted to
participate in lipid A biosynthesis and metabolism, which
describes the biological process it may be involved in. For
an accuracy threshold of 60%, 16,280 GO term predictions are made for more than 1,500 E. coli genes.
Web interface and example
The "Gene Function Predictor" emulates two main different modes of operation. In the first mode, the predictions
can be made for any protein sequence pasted by the user
in a similar manner to Plex [26]. In this Blast mode, the
consensus profile of the given sequence is dynamically
created and the most similar profiles are determined
among the genes of the organisms processed in Phydbac.
The conserved neighbors on the chromosomes are also
determined by comparing the sequences found proximate
to the pasted sequence in all organisms. Genes associated
to the query by Rosetta Stone are identified by the
presence of conserved domains in this sequence. If some
associated partners are determined, an annotation procedure similar to the one described above is applied, even
though all the partners do not come from the same organism. This mode of operation is useful for genes of organisms whose sequence is not complete or not public.

The second mode of operation of the "Gene Function Predictor" is a database gathering the results described in the
study for processed organisms. Currently limited to E. coli,
this mode will be extended to all fully sequenced microorganisms. E. coli genes can be retrieved by their names or
by the presence of a keyword in their annotations. For any
gene queried, its most probable association partners as
well as its significant GO term predictions are displayed
on a single page. The confidence we have in the different
predictions is depicted through keywords and colours. For

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/247

example (Figure 5), yjgI, a protein annotated as "putative
oxidoreductase"is associated to a reductase (fabG) and to
other putative oxidoreductase (ucpA, ygfF) by coevolution (P) and 4 of its 7 best associated partners are acyl-carrier proteins and are significantely linked with yjgI by each
of the three methods (P, C and F). As acyl carrier proteins
are fundamental components of fatty acid biosynthesis,
the best GO term predicted for yjgI is "fatty-acid synthase
activity"and "fatty-acid biosynthesis"(Figure 5). The specific biochemical activity of yjgI cannot be deduced from
these results, but like its most probable partners, yjgI is
likely to be involved in fatty acid synthesis. Furthermore,
acyl carrier protein as well as acyl carrier protein synthase
are known to be essential for E. coli viability. Maybe this is
also the case for yjgI. For such proteins annotated as
"putative ..."or uncharacterized proteins, our tool provides hypothetical functions, either new or on another
level of description. The "Function Predictor" is fully
linked with the software Phydbac, as a closer analysis and
additional information can be retrieved through the display of the profiles, of the conserved gene neighbors and
of the gene fusion.

Conclusion
Although the huge amount of data provided in the past
few years from genome sequencing allows a large spectrum of research axes, the most serious problem of modern bioinformatics is still the quality and degree of
completeness of the annotation of sequenced genomes
[3]. Earlier versions of Phydbac made a step in this direction by providing an interactive resource on prokaryotic
proteins and on their context that may help microbiologists. But the different sources of information contained
in genomic data may not always be trivially extracted by
hand. The new "Gene Function Predictor"integrates the
different concepts to automatically predict putative functions for E. coli genes.
We have shown that the integrated score, from which the
putative pairwise associations are derived, gives better
results than any intermediate approach on its own. We
also compared our results to the best associations found
in major databases based on the same concepts. Our protein linkages proved to be more accurate.
GO assignments were also benchmarked and are highlighted with distinct colors when displayed on the web. As
GO is an annotation standard, the same procedure can be
computed for any prokaryotic organism. A future version
of the "Gene Function predictor", currently limited to E.
coli, will be extended to all fully sequenced micro-organisms, even though a Blast mode of operation is already
available.
