Abstract
Background: Catheters are the most common cause of nosocomial infections and are associated with
increased risk of mortality, length of hospital stay and cost. Prevention of infections and fast and correct
diagnosis is highly important.
Methods: In this study traditional semiquantitative culture-dependent methods for diagnosis of bacteria
involved in central venous catheter-related infections as described by Maki were compared with the
following culture-independent molecular biological methods: Clone libraries, denaturant gradient gel
electrophoresis, phylogeny and fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Results: In accordance with previous studies, the cultivation of central venous catheters from 18 patients
revealed that S. epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci were most abundant and that a few
other microorganisms such as P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae occasionally were found on the catheters.
The molecular analysis using clone libraries and sequencing, denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis and
sequencing provided several important results. The species found by cultivation were confirmed by
molecular methods. However, many other bacteria belonging to the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes,
Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were also found, stressing that only a minor portion of the species present
were found by cultivation. Some of these bacteria are known to be pathogens, some have not before been
described in relation to human health, and some were not closely related to known pathogens and may
represent new pathogenic species. Furthermore, there was a clear difference between the bacterial
species found in biofilm on the external (exluminal) and internal (luminal) side of the central venous
catheter, which can not be detected by Maki's method. Polymicrobial biofilms were observed on most of
the catheters and were much more common than the cultivation-dependent methods indicated.
Conclusion: The results show that diagnosis based on molecular methods improves the detection of
microorganisms involved in central catheter-related infections. The importance of these microorganisms
needs to be investigated further, also in relation to contamination risk from improper catheter handling,
as only in vivo contaminants are of interest. This information can be used for development of fast and more
reliable diagnostic tools, which can be used in combination with traditional methods.

Background
Intravenous catheters are a commonly used medical
device, but their use is often associated with increased
risks for infections [1]. In Europe more than 60% of all
nosocomial infections in European hospitals are associated with a catheter, the majority being central venous
catheters (CVC) [2].
Diagnosis of CVC-associated infection traditionally relies
on clinical features, quantitative cultivation, Gram staining, and acridine-orange leucocyte cytospin test of blood
samples [3-5] or on methods that can only be applied following CVC removal [6]. The international reference diagnostic method is Maki's semi-quantitative method
(1973), which is based on the removal of the catheter and
rolling the distal tip back and forth on an agar plate [3,7].
Fourteen colony-forming units (CFU) define an insertion
site infection [7]. There are, however, several problems
with these methods for diagnosis. It takes at least 2 days to
obtain a result and as only the catheter tip is rolled back
and forth on the agar plate, bacteria further up the catheter
and on the internal site are not included in the analysis.
Furthermore, it has been shown that many catheters
appear sterile (are culture negative) after removal in cases
where there were signs of infections [8,9]. These observations suggest additional diagnostic methods are necessary
in cases where CVC-related infections are suspected.
The problem with Maki's method, and other diagnostic
methods based on cultivation, is that they do not always
detect all microorganisms involved in the infections due
to the use of selective growth media and the poor viability
of some microorganisms on these media [10-12]. This
may be due to antibiotic treatment but more likely
because the microorganisms grow in biofilms. Biofilmforming bacteria behave quite differently from planktonic
cells and many cultivation-based diagnostic tools are
based on planktonic organisms [13]. A recent European
study of intravascular catheter-related infections found
that the microorganisms most often isolated from intravascular catheters were coagulase-negative staphylococci
(30–51.5%), followed by Candida spp., Staphylococcus
aureus, Enterococcus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. [3,14,15].
Acinetobacter spp. [3,16], Enterobacter spp. [3], Klebsiella
pneumonia [15] (all Gammaproteobacteria) and other bacteria have been identified less frequently. However, as
described above, many biofilm-forming bacteria are
poorly detected [11], so potentially several other bacteria
may be involved in the CVC-related infection without
being detected by traditional culture-based diagnostics.
This means that delayed or even incorrect diagnosis can
occur thus increasing the risk of relapse or systemic infection, resulting in pain and discomfort, a less satisfactory
outcome for the patient, technical difficulties for the
health care provider and significant costs for the health

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6890/8/10

service [17]. These problems demonstrate the need for
new diagnostic methods, independent of cultivation.
Molecular techniques have been used successfully for
identification of bacteria in other systems e.g. [18-20],
including some medico-related [6,21,22], but have only
been used for diagnosis of microbial infections in rather
few cases on individual CVCs using broad range 16S rRNA
gene sequencing (see e.g. [23,24]).
The aim of this study was to compare the traditional, culture-dependent methods for the diagnosis of bacteria
involved in CVC-infections with several culture-independent molecular methods to improve the diagnosis of
CVC-related infections.

Methods
Cultivation
All unselected central venous catheters sent to the Department for Clinical Microbiology, Copenhagen, during a 3
months period were included in this study. All catheters
were generally handled under aseptic conditions. The
catheter tips were analysed by Maki's semi-quantitative
method [7], where the catheter tips were rolled back and
forth on blood agar and incubated at 37°C and atmospheric air for 48 hours. Bacteria were further identified
using the Api kit (Biomerieux) of automatic systems for
identification, analysed on a ATB expression 1550 Vitek
Systems (Biomerieux). The cultivation and identification
was always performed by same trained individuals.

For blood culturing the BACTEC 9240 system was used
(BACTEC, Becton Dickinson, Sparks, Maryland, USA). A
minimum of two culture vials per patient, one aerobic
and one anaerobic was filled directly with blood according to the manufacturers instruction. Growth of microorganisms are detected by microorganisms releasing CO2
modulating the fluorescence level in the sensor of the
vials, which is subsequently detected by the instrument.
Cultures were continued for up to one week. If detected
positive, one mL from the vial was aliqouted aseptically
for light microscopy (direct unstained and after Gram
stain) and for culturing on a variety of agar plates (Statens
Seruminstitut, Copenhagen, Denmark) for growth
requirements and further identified using the Api kit of
automatic systems for identification, analysed on a ATB
expression 1550 Vitek Systems. The cultivation and identification was always performed by same trained individuals.
Isolation of biofilm and DNA extraction
The internal site of the catheters was flushed with approximately 10 mL DNA buffer (0.5 M Tris/HCl, 0.5 M NaCl
and 5 mM EDTA) and the biofilm was collected in a tube
(samples called internal/I). Biofilm from the external site
was removed with a scalpel and transferred to DNA buffer

Page 2 of 11

BMC Clinical Pathology 2008, 8:10

(samples called external/E). The catheter was then cut
open and biofilm from the internal site was removed and
transferred to the DNA buffer used to flush the internal
site (internal samples/I). For some catheters it was not
possible to separate biofilm from the internal from the
external site and a separate clone library was constructed
(mixed samples/M). The DNA extraction were performed
using the FastDNA® SPIN kit for soil from QBiogene. The
samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 10 min and the
supernatant was removed so there were approximately
100–150 μL sample left. The pellet was resuspended in
the remaining supernatant and transferred to the Lysing
Matrix E tube and DNA extraction was performed according to the protocol for the FastDNA® SPIN kit for soil. As
negative control a new catheter was rolled back and forth
on blood agar and flushed and scraped as mentioned
above.
16S rRNA gene amplification
The 16S rRNA genes were amplified by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) using Taq DNA polymerase with primers
8F (616V; [25]) and 1390R [26] targeting conserved
domains. The samples were amplified according to [20]
(using ANME primers, various numbers of cycles). Amplification of samples for DGGE were done using primer
341F-GC [27] and primer 907R [26]. Negative controls
including water and PCR mix were included for every five
samples and were always negative indicating there was no
contamination of the reagents. Stringent procedures were
employed to avoid contamination, e.g. by using a PCR
cabinet with UV light and all DNA handling was done
with aerosol filter pipette tips to avoid cross contamination.
Denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)
DGGE analyses of the amplicons were performed on 8%
polyacrylamide gels containing denaturant gradients of
20–70%. Electrophoresis was performed in 1 × TAE buffer
at 100 V overnight using the D-GENE™ gel system (Biorad) and the gels were stained with Sybr Gold solution.
The most intensive DGGE-bands were excised and prepared for sequencing. The excised bands were re-amplified with PCR and the PCR products were thereafter
purified with NucleoSpin Extract II Machery Nagel. The
similarities of the sequences from reamplified and cut
DGGE bands (approximately 550 bp) were analyzed
using the NCBI Blast search tool at http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/.
Cloning, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
The amplified 16S rRNA gene products were purified with
a Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Cloning was
performed using a TOPO TA Cloning® kit for sequencing
(Invitrogen life technologies). Plasmids were purified
using a Fastplasmid mini kit (Eppendorf). Purified plas-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6890/8/10

mids were amplified using M13 primers to test for inserts
with correct length. The clones were sequenced using a
MegaBase 100 DNA sequencing system (Amersham pharmacia). Similarity searches of the retrieved 16S rRNA gene
sequences against sequences deposited in publicly accessible databases were performed using the NCBI Blast search
tool at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/. All clones
were initially sequenced using the forward primer 8F, and
based on the results; they were grouped according to the
accession number of the closest relative in the NCBI database. Randomly selected members of each group were
sequenced using the reverse primers 1390R and 907R to
gain consensus sequences representing each group
(almost full length ~1350 bp). All the clones with the
closest relative being an uncultured bacterium were also
sequenced using the reverse primers. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified using search results of
at least 97% similarity. Checks for chimeric sequences
were conducted using the CHECK_CHIMERA program
from
Ribosomal
Database
Project
http://
rdp.cme.msu.edu and the program BELLEROPHON [28].
The ARB software was used for phylogenetic analysis
http://www.arb-home.de. The sequences were aligned
using the FastAligner, and subsequent manual refinement. Unambiguously aligned sequences were analysed
using the distance, parsimony, and maximum likelihood
approaches with default settings. Additionally, the Bacteria sequence conservation filter of the ssu_jan04_corr_opt
ARB database (available at http://www.arb-home.de) was
applied. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the
consensus sequences representing the different groups of
bacteria, then the partial sequences were added to the
existing consensus trees by the "add species to existing
tree" function in the ARB software. Prior a filter was made
to define which positions to be used in adding the partial
sequences (data not shown). Generally, the results
obtained by NCBI Blast Search corresponded well to the
positions in the phylogenetic tree. The coverage ratio (C)
for each of the clone libraries were calculated with C = (1
- (n1·N-1))·100%, where n1 is the number of OTUs containing only one sequence and N is the total number of
clones analysed [18].
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
The FISH procedure was performed on fixed biofilm [29],
and visualized with a Zeiss LSM 510 (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) confocal laser scanning microscope. The
following oligonucleotide probes were used: EUB338,
EUB338-II, and EUB338-III, called EUBmix (all Bacteria;
[30,31]), and GAM42a (Gammaproteobacteria; [32]). Oligonucleotides were 5'-labelled with 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-N-hydroxy-succinimide ester (FLUOS) or with
sulphoindocyanine dyes (Cy3) (Thermo Hybaid, Germany).

Results
Catheter samples
Eighteen central venous catheters were collected from
seven different wards at Copenhagen University Hospital,
Denmark (Table 1). Suspicion of infection was raised in
cases of blood cultures with low-level pathogenic bacteria
like coagulase negative staphylococci (especially if recurrent), positive blood cultures without another obvious
focus of infection or cases with signs of infection at insertion site of the CVC. Finally, some CVCs were sent for culturing as routine, even without suspicion of infection.

For 3 patients it was not possible to receive any data at all
about the catheterization. From the patients with available information, the time of catheterization ranged from
5 days to 3 months. In 9 cases there were suspicion of
infection and in 6 cases the catheter had previously been
changed, and in one case the catheter was changed several

times. All patients received antibiotic treatment before or
during catheterization based on suspicion of infection.
Cultivation data
Immediately after removal of the catheters from the
patients, the catheter tip was analysed by Maki's semiquantitave method (Table 2). S. epidermidis and other
coagulase-negative staphylococci were most abundant
and P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and some fungi were
detected on one catheter each. Cultivation did not detect
any bacteria on seven of the catheters although there was
suspicion of infections in four of these based on blood
cultivation data (Table 1). Two catheters had mixed
growth based on cultivation (1 and 18), and the bacteria
on catheter 18 could not be identified further. Coagulasenegative staphylococci, streptococci, E. faecium, C.
jeikeium, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and L. lactis were identified in blood samples mainly before the catheters were
removed.
Molecular methods
It was possible to separate the biofilm from the external
and internal sites for 14 of the 18 catheters. For 4 of the

Cultivation data from the 18 CVC investigated. All except those identified as mixed growth were quantified to more than 15 CFU.

catheters (sample number 9, 10, 12 and 18) this was not
possible and a separate clone library was constructed
based on subsamples from these mixed biofilms (called
mixed/M).
Clone libraries
The results are presented in Table 3 and they are based on
both partial and consensus sequences. All of the bacteria

detected by cultivation, excepting K. pneumoniae, were
also detected in the clone libraries, however in all cases a
large number of other bacteria were also present. The
most abundant clone on the external site was S. epidermidis, which was also found to be abundant by cultivation. Fungi were not included in the molecular analysis.

Further phylogenetic analysis of the sequences obtained
from the 3 clone libraries and their closest relatives found
by the BLAST search were performed in ARB. The methods
applied generally resulted in congruent tree topologies,
and the maximum likelihood tree is shown illustrating
the phylogeny of the consensus sequences (Figure 1).
Three phyla were represented in the clone library for the
external site: Proteobacteria (Beta-, Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria), the Firmicutes, and the Actinobacteria. The
group with most clones in this clone library was the Firmicutes, dominated by the staphylococci (constituted 59.7%
of the identified clones). "Uncultured Deltaproteobacteria"
was represented with 9 sequences (constituted 14.5% of
the identified clones) while a number of clones were
found 1–3 times. Two sequences (number 206 and 261)
were denoted "uncultured bacterium clone 654931" from
the BLAST search, but as can be seen by the phylogenetic
tree (Fig. 1), they seem to belong to the Betaproteobacteria.
The internal site was represented by 3 phyla: the Gammaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. The Gammaproteobacteria was the biggest group with 39 sequences
(62.9%), followed by the coagulase-negative staphylococci constituting 30.6% of the clone library.
The mixed sample contained Proteobacteria (Alpha-, Betaand Gammaproteobacteria), Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria.
Firmicutes accounted for the biggest group, followed by
the Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria. It was the only clone
library containing Alphaproteobacteria. The phylogenetic
relationship of clone number 107 was resolved using
ARB, which supported its relatedness to Corynebacterium
sp.
The coverage ratio for the 3 clone libraries was high for the
clone library of the internal site (96.8%) and for external
site (90.2%), indicating that most of the organisms in the
sample had been detected. The lowest coverage ratio is
from the mixed sample (85.8%), which was based only
on 35 sequences, compared to approximately 60
sequences for both the external and internal site.
Denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)
DGGE was performed on biofilm samples from the individual catheters in order to gain more information about
the bacterial diversity. In most DGGE lanes several bands
were present, which means that numerous species were
present in the original biofilms. The number of clear
bands ranged from 2 to 14. Selected bands were excised,
reamplified and sequenced in order to identify the bacteria represented by that band. Figure 2 presents a representative DGGE gel, demonstrating the variety of banding
patterns and the numbers represent bands applicable for
reamplification and sequencing. A band on the DGGE gel
is assumed to represent one bacterial species/subspecies

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6890/8/10

and accordingly there seemed to be several species present
in the biofilm on both the external and internal site of the
individual catheters. It was possible to cut out bands from
all the samples except from the internal site of catheter 16.
In the majority of the samples, more than one band was
applicable for reamplification and sequencing, even
though some of the bands appear rather weak on the
images. The presence of only one species was found in
biofilm from three catheter samples using DGGE, whereas
the biofilm from the other catheter samples was definitely
polymicrobial. The bacteria identified using DGGE are
described in Additional file 1. On many catheters the
DGGE results, especially the external site, were consistent
with the cultivation data. However, many other microorganisms were identified on the individual catheters and
significant differences were observed between samples
from internal and external site in most cases.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
The abundance of bacteria in most samples was too low
for FISH detection. To illustrate the potential of the
method, it was possible to locate Gammaproteobacteria in
sample 2 by FISH with probe GAM42a (data not shown).
Interestingly, the clone libraries and DGGE also detected
Gammaproteobacteria in this sample in contrast to the cultivation data (catheter 2, Table 2).

Discussion
The comprehensive combination of molecular methods
used in this study has not been used in relation to microbial colonization of CVC previously, but has recently been
used in another study related to human health on atherosclerotic lesions in patients with coronary heart disease
[21]. These methods substantially improved the diagnostic outcome in the study and thus strongly support the
finding in this study that the traditional culture-dependent methods can benefit from supplemental molecular
diagnostics.
Five important results were obtained from the comparison of the cultivation results with the results from the
molecular analysis using clone libraries, DGGE and
sequencing: 1) The species found by cultivation was also
found by molecular methods, 2) Many other bacteria (or,
more correctly, clones or sequences) were also found
stressing that only a minor part of the species present was
found by cultivation, 3) Some of these bacteria described
by molecular methods are not closely related to known
pathogens and may represent new pathogenic species or
harmless colonizers, 4) There was a clear difference
between the bacterial species on the external and internal
site of the CVC, 5) Polymicrobial biofilms seem much
more common than the cultivation-dependent methods
indicated. These results are further discussed below.

include coagulase-negative staphylococci, S. aureus, Enterococcus spp., Corynebacterium spp., Micrococcus spp., Burkholderia spp., Stenotrophomonas spp., Pseudomonas spp.
Acinetobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp.
Other bacterial species were found, which hitherto have
not been related to CVC colonization, but are well known
in relation to other infections. Acidovorax sp. (clones were
found with 94–99% similarity to known Acidovorax) was
initially classified as Pseudomonas, they are environmental
bacteria, found in soil, water and as plant pathogens, but
has recently been isolated from blood cultures from a
human patient with sepsis, indicating that this organism
has a pathogenic potential in the healthcare setting [33].
Massilia timonia (97–98% similarity) has been involved in
human infections, e.g. wound infections [34] and also
been isolated from blood cultures from an immunocompromised patient [35]. Peptostreptococcus octavius (93–95%
similarity) is a member of the human microflora and is
frequently isolated from sites of infections and comprise
approximately one quarter of all isolates from anaerobic
infections [36]. Both Massilia sp. and P. octavius are slowly
growing and fastidious and therefore may be difficult to
detect using the culture-dependent method, if the incubation time is less than 48 h and is not anaerobic. Propionibacterium acnes (98% similarity) is part of the normal
microflora of human skin and is recognized for its role in
acne vulgaris [37], but do also cause infections in patients
with implantable prostheses, where it has been associated
with prosthetic valve related endocarditis [38].

Microorganisms on CVC as detected by molecular methods
Many different bacterial species were found using the
molecular techniques and many of them have been isolated from CVCs in our study or in other studies. These

Lastly, some bacteria were identified that have not been
related to human health before e.g. the alphaproteobacterial Afipia, which have been isolated from hospital water
supply and is thereby present in the hospital environment
[39]. The clones identified as Afipia broomeae had a similarity of 98%. Bradyrhizobium sp. has been isolated in biofilm in dental waterline tubing [40], but not found to be
related to any human diseases. These are symbiotic nitrogen fixers that can be found in the roots of plants [41] and
they were identified with a similarity of 96–98%. The betaproteobacterial Delftia tsuruhatensis (96% similarity) is a
terephthalate-assimilating bacterium [42] and Diaphorobacter sp. (98% similarity) is a denitrifying bacterium [43]
and are both isolated from activated sludge.
On seven catheters no growth were observed with the cultivation, but all catheters were represented by bands on
the DGGE, which were possible to amplify and sequence,
except catheter 7, where "no significant match" was
achieved by sequence analysis. The results obtained by
DGGE from the catheters with no growth in many cases
showed bacteria, not normally isolated from central
venous catheters, including Delftia tsuruhatensis, Propionibacterium acnes and Afipia sp. They were also found in the

Page 8 of 11

BMC Clinical Pathology 2008, 8:10

clone libraries. However, the blood cultivation data from
these seven patients before the catheters were removed
correlated with DGGE results in catheter number 3 and
11, but not number 6, 10 and 12. A relatively big group
from the external site in the clone library was the "uncultured Deltaproteobacteria" and they were also detected in
biofilm from the external site of catheter 16 using DGGE.
Unfortunately, the clones could not be identified further.
The Deltaproteobacteria includes amongst others a large
group of sulfate-reducing bacteria [44].
Generally, most bacteria found by the DGGE approach
were also identified in the clone library, except some
uncultured organisms and some sequences related to Wolbachia and Jenibacter molonis. In contrast, many bacteria
were found only in the clone library, supporting that
DGGE only detects the dominating bacteria present in a
sample.
So even though many of the bacteria found in the clone
libraries have not previously been related to CVC-related
infections, several are related to the hospital environment
and may be involved in nosocomial infections. Many
sequences were found where the closest relatives were
uncultured organisms, of which the significance is
unknown. However, many of these results were based on
a relatively low similarity with known organisms, and
they could either be really unknown species or be a result
of PCR or sequencing errors. Therefore, the role of the
detected, but relatively unknown bacteria needs to be
resolved in future studies in order to investigate whether
they are of importance for biofilm-formation or pathogenicity.
The presence of many bacteria in the biofilm from the
CVC not detected by cultivation could potentially be due
to DNA from dead bacteria ("naked DNA"), either by natural death or antibiotic treatment, as all the patients
included in this study received antibiotics during catheterization. Interestingly, it was found using chinchillas as
model system that antibiotic-treated bacteria can persist
in a viable state for weeks and can be detected by molecular methods and not cultivation-dependent methods [45],
while bacterial DNA from non-viable microorganisms
could not be detected by any method. Due to the fact that
antibiotics often are used on patients with CVC-related
infections cultivation will be hampered and DNA based
techniques may be useful in such patient populations
[46].
Microbial populations on internal (luminal) and external
(exluminal) site of CVC
When the external and internal site of the catheters were
compared the differences in the microbial composition
was observed both using DGGE and by comparing the
three clone libraries. The clone libaries showed that bio-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6890/8/10

films from catheters from the external site was dominated
by the Firmicutes, especially the staphylococci. The second
most abundant group was the "uncultured Deltaproteobacteria" and they were only found on the external site. The
internal site of the CVC was colonized mainly by the Gammaproteobacteria. Another study conducted by Donlan
[15] supports these observations. It was found that the
extent and location of biofilm correlated to the duration
of catheterization: short term (< 10 days) catheters had
greater biofilm formation on the external surface and
long-term catheters (30 days) had more biofilm formation on the catheter inner lumen. Furthermore, some species of the Gammaproteobacteria, like Pseudomonas sp.
appeared to sustain growth in intravenous fluids better
than for example the staphylococci [15], which is in
accordance with our results.
Firmicutes and Actinobacteria were often detected using
DGGE, both on biofilm from the external and internal
site, while the "uncultured Deltaproteobacteria" were only
found on biofilm from the external site of catheter
number 16. This illustrates a preferential PCR amplification of these "uncultured Deltaproteobacteria" may have
occurred in the clone library. The mixed biofilm sample
was dominated in approximately equal extent by the Firmicutes, the Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria and was the only
clone library to include Alphaproteobacteria. DGGE
detected Alphaproteobacteria both in internal biofilm from
two samples and also in a mixed sample, exemplifying
few of the differences obtained by the two molecular
approaches.
As Maki's semi-quantitative method was used, the bacteria
identified by cultivation must primarily represent bacteria
on the external site of the catheters. This was, however,
not supported by this study. All bacteria identified by cultivation, except for K. pneumoniae, were found by rRNA
gene sequencing. This one missing species could either be
due to incomplete coverage of the clone libraries or
because of loss of material during the rolling of the catheter back and forth on the agar plate prior to the removal
of biofilm for the molecular analysis. Importantly, the
cultivation approach could have been more intensive in
this study, using e.g. sonication to remove cells or anaerobic cultivation techniques, which would probably have
resulted in a higher diversity in the detected microorganisms.
Polymicrobial infections
Using traditional cultivation some reported colonizations
on CVC have been polymicrobial, whereas monospecies
infections seem to be observed most common [14].
DGGE clearly demonstrated that catheters were in most
cases colonized with several species in contrast to the cultivation data primarily showing presence of one or none
species. However, in accordance with previous reports,
Page 9 of 11

BMC Clinical Pathology 2008, 8:10

separate bands were observed in some lanes in the DGGE
gels representing the same species, for example in sample
1 (external and internal site), sample 6 and 13 (external
site) and sample 8 and 11B (internal site) [47-49] and
may be due to more than one allele of 16S rRNA genes
being present in the same species or presence of different
strains of the identified microorganisms with differences
in only one or few base pairs. Interestingly, there seemed
to be an increased bacterial diversity in biofilm from catheters with a longer insertion time.
Molecular methods for diagnosis?
Theoretically Maki's semi-quantitative method, the international diagnostic standard [3] primarily detects bacteria
on the outer surface of the catheter [3]. However, methods
that detect and quantify biofilms both on the inner and
the outer surface of catheters will improve detection of
biofilm colonizations [15]. Improved methods are also
needed for diagnosis while the catheter still is in use [17].
This means that it is essential with an earlier and more
precise identification of the pathogens most frequently
associated with infections [50,51]. Improvements to the
measurement of the efficacy of antimicrobial agents on
these bacteria are also required, due to their growth in biofilms [51].

Our observations do not allow us to conclude that all bacteria detected in the biofilm on CVC are important for the
biofilm formation or pathogenicity [52]. There is also a
potential risk of catheter contamination during removal,
even though the clinicians work carefully and aseptically,
so we can not completely exclude the possibility that
some of the detected microorganisms (using cultivation
and molecular methods) did not colonize the catheters in
vivo. However, the present study provides a basic list of
potential pathogens related to colonizations of CVC, and
is a starting point for further investigations. The next step
could be to include more catheters in a similar study to
increase the available data. Development of a quantitative
PCR assay for quantification of the abundance of particular target organisms is also a possibility, e.g. directly on
catheter biofilm but also measured in blood samples
drawn through the CVC, which could detect the microorganisms on the internal site of the catheters still in situ [6].
