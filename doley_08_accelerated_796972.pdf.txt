Abstract
Background: Snake venoms consist primarily of proteins and peptides showing a myriad of potent
biological activities which have been shaped by both adaptive and neutral selective forces. Venom
proteins are encoded by multigene families that have evolved through a process of gene duplication
followed by accelerated evolution in the protein coding region.
Results: Here we report five gene structures of three-finger toxins from a viperid snake, Sistrurus
catenatus edwardsii. These toxin genes are structured similarly to elapid and hydrophiid three-finger
toxin genes, with two introns and three exons. Both introns and exons show distinct patterns of
segmentation, and the insertion/deletion of segments may define their evolutionary history. The
segments in introns, when present, are highly similar to their corresponding segments in other
members of the gene family. In contrast, some segments in the exons show high similarity, while
others are often distinctly different among corresponding regions of the isoforms.
Conclusion: Ordered, conserved exon structure strongly suggests that segments in
corresponding regions in exons have been exchanged with distinctly different ones during the
evolution of these genes. Such a "switching" of segments in exons may result in drastically altering
the molecular surface topology and charge, and hence the molecular targets of these three-finger
toxins. Thus the phenomenon of accelerated segment switch in exons to alter targeting (ASSET)
may play an important role in the evolution of three-finger toxins, resulting in a family of toxins
with a highly conserved structural fold but widely varying biological activities.

Background
Snake venom is a mixture of proteins and polypeptides
which can be divided into enzymatic and non-enzymatic
families [1]. Three-finger toxins are non-enzymatic
polypeptides which belong to a well characterized super-

family of snake venom toxins. Structurally they have similar folds, with three β-sheeted loops ('fingers') that are
stabilized by 4–5 disulfide bridges present in the central
core [2,3]. Despite their structural similarity, they differ
widely in their molecular targets. For example, members

of this family target various receptor/ion channel proteins
such as α1-nAChRs, L-type calcium channels and integrin
αIIbβ3 (Table 1). Such a wide diversity in their molecular
targets is due to changes in their primary sequences, while
keeping the basic molecular scaffold intact. Analysis of
amino acid sequences and gene structures will help elucidate the molecular evolution of these functionally important toxins.
As with other snake venom proteins [4-6], three-finger
toxins are also encoded by a multigene family [7-10] and
contain functionally diversified isoforms. These venom
protein families have evolved through a process of gene
duplication followed by accelerated point mutations in
the protein coding region [11-15]. For example, in phospholipase A2 genes, the dN/dS ratio in the coding regions
is higher than in the non-coding regions [4,16]. Such
adaptive Darwinian evolution plays an important role in
the evolution of novel gene functions, leading to functional diversity in each superfamily of toxins. The accelerated rate of mutations in venom proteins likely provides a
competitive edge in predator-prey interactions [17].
Until recently, three-finger toxins were thought to be
present only in venoms of the snake families Elapidae
[18]. However, we and others have demonstrated their
presence in the venoms of colubrid and viperid snakes
[19-22]. Recently we constructed a cDNA library from the
venom glands of Sistrurus catenatus edwardsii (Desert Massasauga) and identified a three-finger toxin family (0.83%
abundance) in the venom gland transcriptome [23]. As
three-finger toxins are uncommon in viperid venoms, we
performed RT-PCR using a separate pool of RNA as template and found five transcripts that encode three-finger
toxins [23]. They have a 21 residue signal peptide followed by a mature protein consisting of 64–68 residues,
and the ten conserved cysteine residues, which form five
disulfide bridges characteristic of most three-finger toxins,
are also present. These viperid toxins belong to the non-

conventional three-finger toxin subfamily that has the
fifth disulfide bridge in the first loop [24], and they were
named 3FTx 1 through 3FTx 5. 3FTx 4 and 5 differ only in
one residue in the mature protein, whereas all others are
distinct isoforms. All of them have nearly identical signal
peptide sequences, but the sequence identity in the
mature protein region is often low (31–60%) with the
exception of 3FTx 4 and 5 (94% identity) (Figure 1). A systematic comparison of amino acid sequences of the
mature proteins indicate that some segments are highly
conserved (60–100% identity) between two or three isoforms, whereas other regions are not (only 12.5–50%
identity) (see Additional file 1). Such similarities and dissimilarities in various other segments were observed
among these three-finger toxins and they appear to be
evolving through "switching" of various segments. To
understand the molecular evolution of these toxins, we
obtained the gene sequences of these three-finger toxins
using genomic DNA (gDNA) PCR and GenomeWalking
approaches. This is the first report of gene structure of
three-finger toxins from snakes of the family Viperidae.
The analyses of their gene sequences show that segment
"switching" occurs only in the exons, not in the introns.
This phenomenon of exchange is likely an important contributor to the gene evolution of this family of toxins
which exhibit numerous distinct pharmacological effects.

Results and Discussion
Gene structure
To understand the evolution of the three-finger toxins in
S. catenatus edwardsii venom, we determined their gene
structures (Figure 2A). We obtained the full length gene of
3FTx 3 by gDNA PCR. However, we obtained only partial
genes (from exon II to exon III) of the other four toxins by
gDNA PCR even after several attempts, perhaps due to
suboptimal annealing of the primers or the thermal
cycling profile. We performed GenomeWalking to obtain
the remaining gene segments from exon I to exon II (Figure 2A). At least 16 clones were sequenced from each PCR

product to obtain the gene sequences of all five three-finger toxins (2.246 kb for 3FTx 1, 2.145 kb for 3FTx 2, 2.186
kb for 3FTx 4, 2.167 kb for 3FTx 5 and 2.986 kb for 3FTx
3). The cDNA sequences were used to determine the exonintron boundaries (Figure 2B), which follow the GT-AG
rule of splice-donor and -acceptor sites [25]. Genes of all
five three-finger toxins have similar architecture, with two
introns and three exons, similar to those of elapid threefinger toxin genes. Sequence data was deposited in GenBank under accession numbers EU 293789, EU 293790,
EU 293791, EU 293792 and EU 293793, respectively. The
gene sequences were used to determine the phylogenetic
relationship with three-finger toxin genes from the snake
families Elapidae and Colubridae. The phylogenetic tree
was constructed using DNAMAN, and viperid three-finger
toxin genes form a separate cluster in the tree (Figure 3).
Intron I
Intron I plays an important role in the expression of various genes [26,27] and is the most variable region in elapid
three-finger toxin genes [28]. Sequence alignment of
intron I of the viperid genes revealed that it can be divided
into segments similar to elapid three-finger toxin genes
[28]. Segments I, II, V, VII and X are conserved in all the
genes except erabutoxin c gene (Figure 4). In 3FTx 1, 4, 5
and 2, segments III and IV are missing. New additional
segments IIIa, Va and Vc are present in 3FTx 1, 4, 5 and 2.
3FTx 1 has an insertion (segment Vb), whereas 3FTx 3 has
one additional segment identified as Vd (Figure 4). Interestingly, the additional segments in viperid three-finger
gene are short or long nucleotide repeats. Segment Va in
3FTx 1, 2, 4 and 5 has 19–27 continuous "TAA" repeats,
while the Vb in 3FTx 1 has 18 continuous "GAT" repeats.
These shorter repeats may represent microsatellite
sequences. The segment Vd in 3FTx 3 has three different
repeats: two repeats of TATTTCATTCCATTCCATATTTTCGATTCTATTCCTGTTCTG (red boxes), three repeats of
TCTATTCTATTCCACTCC sequences (blue boxes) and 14
and 27 continuous repeats of CTATT (pink boxes) (see
Additional file 2).

Addition/deletion of segments in intron I is also observed
in elapid and hydrophiid genes and was linked to the evolutionary diversification of these snake toxin genes
[28,29]. Intron I of all viperid three-finger genes are nearly
identical; among 3FTx 1, 2, 4 and 5 there is only a short
insertion (segment Vb) in 3FTx 1. 3FTx 3 is distinct from
other 3FTxs. It has two additional segments (IV and Vd
compared to viperid genes) and segment IIIa is missing
(Figure 4). The additional segments are either deleted
(elapid) or added (viperid) in the gene of three-finger toxins during their evolution, but the role of these insertions/
deletions in the expression of the three-finger toxins is
currently unknown. Interestingly, the region of exon-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/196

intron boundary is similar to elapid and hydrophiid genes
and seems to be conserved among all of them.
Intron II
Intron II of the elapid and hydrophiid three-finger toxin
genes is conserved and was thought to be not segmented
[28]. However, comparison of the intron II sequences of
viperid genes reveals that it also can be divided into segments, similar to intron I (Figure 5). Segments I, III and V
are conserved in all three-finger genes. However, 3FTx 1,
4, 5 and 2 genes have an additional common segment
(IV), and 3FTx 3 has one additional segments (II). Thus,
segmentation appears to be a common structural feature
of both introns, and the insertion/deletion of segments
may contribute to their regulation of expression. Further,
analysis of segments may facilitate understanding the evolutionary history of this unusual gene structural feature.
Segment switching in exons
Exons also appeared to have segments (Figure 1). As
expected because of overall size, the segments in exons are
much smaller as compared to those in introns (4–7 bp in
segment vii in exon II to 53 bp in segment i in exon III,
compared to 21–22 bp in segment X to 680 bp in segment
Vd in intron 1). Analysis of the gene sequences reveals that
the gain/loss of segments occurs in both introns and
exons (Figure 6). The segments in introns, when present,
show high similarities (>85% identity). In contrast, while
some exon segments show high sequence identity (60–
100% identity; shown in same colors), other segments
show low identity (12.5–50% identity; shown in different
colors). Such similarity/dissimilarity of segments is more
prominent in exon II and exon III. In exon II, there are
four different kinds of segment ii; in 3FTx 4 and 5 they are
identical, whereas in the other genes they are totally different (Figure 6). In the same way, segment v is similar in
3FTx 1, 4 and 5, whereas in 3FTx 2 and 3 it is different.
Segment vi is absent in 3FTx 1 but present in the other
genes; this segment is similar in 3FTx 4 and 5 but different
in 3FTx 2 and 3. Thus exon II appears to have evolved
through "switching" of segments, although the origins of
the "new" segments are not known. Similarly, exon III
also appears to have evolved through "switching" of segments. However, this phenomenon is not observed in
introns of these genes, although there are additions/deletions of a few short segments in introns (see Additional
file 1). The switching of segments in exons has far reaching effects on the biological effects of the toxins. The
changed segments will affect the overall surface properties
of the expressed protein (such as charge density and
hydrophobicity) and hence the function. In contrast, the
small additions/deletions in introns will not affect the
nature of the protein product, but may affect its expression. It is important to note that in spite of this segment
switching, positions of cysteine residues are conserved,

thereby maintaining similar disulfide pairing, folding
architecture and the overall three-finger fold of the mature
protein.
There are several possibilities that could explain the
observed switching of segments.
1. Splicing variations: The difference in isoforms of some
proteins due to change of segments can be easily
explained based on splicing variation [30]. However,
unlike these proteins, the segment switching in viperid
3FTx occurs within exon II and exon III. Among three-finger toxins, long-chain neurotoxins arose from short-chain
neurotoxins through an error in the splicing site [31].
Such an error leads to insertion of a short segment with
the fifth disulfide in the second loop. In viperid toxin
genes, however, the insertions of segments do not occur at
the intron-exon boundaries, so the mechanism of inser-

tions/deletions or switching of segments does not occur
due to errors in splicing.
2. Recombination: Distinct genes encoding isoforms of
proteins are also generated through recombination of two
related/unrelated genes [32,33]. In general, the segments
involved in such recombination events are fairly large
(700 to 2500 bp), and the segments that are exchanged in
exons of 3FTxs are probably much too small. Therefore,
canonical recombination may not be involved in these
exchange events.
3. Accumulation of point mutations: Accelerated point
mutations in three-finger toxins are common and they
lead to the evolution of several isoforms [10,11,14].
Although these point mutations occur in exon segments,
they may not explain such a distinct change in the
sequences of segments. This possibility requires the

repeated occurrence and accumulation of multiple point
mutations within each segment. Further, all the intermediates have to be selected through evolution. The absence
of intermediate isoforms, however, contradicts this possibility; and
4. Independent recruitment events: Venom protein genes
are thought to be recruited to the venom gland genome by
gene duplication of a normal physiologically important
gene and recruitment of the duplicated gene for expression in the venom gland [34]. It is possible, but not probable, that each of these isoforms has an independent
origin and their ancestral three-finger toxin genes were
recruited at different times. High similarity across numerous 3FTx genes in exon I, and introns I and II, supports
instead a single recruitment and lineage of these genes
and not multiple recruitment events. In the unlikely
events of independent recruitments, introns will have to
undergo convergent evolution to explain the high similarity while the exons will be undergoing divergent evolution. Therefore, segment switching results in divergence of
functional regions of exons (see below) while maintain-

ing the basic fold, rather than convergence upon a single
scaffold motif during independent recruitment.
Although the mechanism of the exchange of segments in
exons is unknown, it is apparent that these events play
important roles in the evolution of these toxins, in addition to the role that accelerated point mutations in the
exons plays in toxin evolution [10,11,14]. These point
mutations appear to alter the interaction surfaces of toxins
[35]. However, they affect one residue at a time and a
smaller molecular surface, and they may help in fine-tuning of functional sites of the molecule for interaction with
specific molecular targets. They may (a) enhance the affinity to a specific receptor or ion channel; (b) change the
specificity to another closely related receptor or ion channel; and (c) change the species specificity of the toxin to a
particular receptor. In contrast, accelerated exchange of
larger segments drastically changes parts of the interacting
loops or toxin surface. Therefore, these exchanges of segments may help in switching the molecular targets of toxins and hence affecting their pharmacological properties.
We propose that accelerated segment switch in exons to

alter targeting (ASSET) is a phenomenon which plays an
important role in "remodeling" a toxin toward a different
and novel receptor target (see below).
ASSET and evolution of molecular surfaces
To understand the impact of switching of segments on the
molecular surfaces of three-finger toxins in S. catenatus
edwardsii, we modeled all four distinct three-finger toxins.
As shown in Figure 7, the three β-sheeted loops in these
toxins are distinctly different from one another, as most of
them are replaced by segment switching (Figure 7, top
row). Further, the electrostatic potentials of these toxins
indicate that the charge distributions on their molecular
surfaces are also different. 3FTx 1 and 4 have more acidic
residues on the surface as compared to 3FTx 2 and 3 (Figure 7, middle and bottom rows). This drastic difference in
the charge residues on the surface is due to the exchange
of segments (see Additional file 1), but retention of the
similar molecular fold. Such a change in the charged residues might play an important role in switching the molecular targets. Since most of the functional sites are located
on these β-sheeted loops (for a review see, [36]), it is logical to propose that all of these novel viperid toxins have
distinct pharmacological properties. Therefore, ASSET
phenomena affect the molecular surfaces of three-finger
toxins significantly and alter their molecular targets, playing a crucial role in the evolution of the three-finger toxins.

Conclusion
Systematic analyses of gene sequences of Sistrurus catenatus edwardsii (Desert Massasauga) three-finger toxins indicate that short segments in exons II and III are changed
more rapidly compared to intron segments. We propose
that such a phenomenon (ASSET) of accelerated segment
switching in exons has the effect of rapidly altering the
molecular surface properties. This mechanism of rapid
change can provide a selective advantage to venomous
snakes in predator/prey coevolutionary arms races, resulting in a diversity of structurally similar toxins in a single
venom and allowing the venom toxins repertoire to stay a
step ahead of prey defensive responses [1,17]. Thus ASSET
plays an important role in changing the molecular target
and hence the pharmacology of these toxins.

Three-dimensional models of three-finger toxins from S. catenatus edwardsii venom gland transcriptome. Top row shows the
solid ribbon models. Segments are color coded as in Figure 1. Middle and bottom (180° rotation) rows show the electrostatic
potential of both the surface. The positively and negatively charged residues are shown in blue and red colors, respectively, and
the hydrophobic residues are shown in white color.

ABI PRISM® BigDye® terminator cycle sequencing ready
reaction kit was purchased from Perkin Elmer (Foster City,
CA, USA). Oligonucleotides were custom synthesized by
1st BASE (Singapore). All other chemicals and reagents
used were of the purest grade available.
Genomic DNA extraction
Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from the S. catenatus
edwardsii liver tissue (30 mg, previously stored in
RNAlater) using the DNeasy Tissue kit (Qiagen, USA)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNaseH was
used during the extraction to remove contaminating RNA.
The integrity of the isolated gDNA was confirmed by 0.8%

agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA was quantified spectrophotometrically.
gDNA PCR
gDNA PCR was performed to obtained the gene sequence
of 3FTx 3 using a gene-specific forward primer 5'ATGAAAACTCTGCTGTTGATCCTGGGGGT-3' and genespecific reverse primer 5'-GCCAATAGTCACTTTTAGAACTATTTGTTGCAGTTGTCTG-3'. The PCR reaction contained 1.0 unit of Long PCR Enzyme Mix, 1 μg of gDNA.
0.2 mM dNTP, 0.2 μM primers and 1 × Long enzyme mix
polymerase buffer in a total of 50 μL. The thermal cycling
reaction involved 35 cycles of one step each at 95°C for 15

s, 60°C for 15 s, 68°C for 3 min followed by a final extension step at 68°C for 10 min. The amplified PCR products
were extracted and cloned as mentioned below.
Construction of GenomeWalking libraries
The GenomeWalking libraries were constructed using the
Universal GenomeWalker™ kit (Clontech Laboratories
Inc, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Briefly, libraries were constructed with 3 μg of gDNA
restriction digested with DraI, EcoRV, PvuII and StuI. The
'genome walk' involved two sets of primers: adaptor
primer 1 (AP1-sense) 5'-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3' and nested PCR adaptor primer 2 (AP2-sense) 5'ACTATAGGGCACGCGTGGT-3', both provided in the kit,
and 25-mer and 27-mer gene-specific primers designed
from the signal peptide regions of cDNAs of all the threefinger toxins. Primary and nested PCRs were performed as
recommended by the manufacturer (BD GenomeWalker™) using Advantage Polymerase 2 Mix obtained
from Clontech Laboratories Inc (Palo Alto, CA, USA). The
50.0 μl reaction mixture consisted of 1 μl of DNA template (0.1 μg) (either from each library or from primary
PCR products), 1× PCR buffer (provided in the kit), 0.2
mM dNTPs, 0.2 μM appropriate adaptor primers, 0.2 μM
of appropriate gene-specific primers, 1× Advantage™ 2
polymerase mix. The thermal cycling profile used was as
follows: 7 cycles of 94°C for 2 s, 72°C for 3 min; 32 cycles
of 94°C for 2 s, and 67°C for 4 min followed by a final
extension at 67°C for 7 min. The PCR products were purified, cloned and sequenced.
Cloning and sequencing
PCR products were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, visualized by ethidium bromide staining and
purified using a gel extraction kit or PCR purification kit.
Purified PCR products were ligated either to pDrive vector
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or pCR®-XL-TOPO® vector
(Invitrogen, USA). Ligated vectors were transformed to
DH5a competent cells by heat shock. Kanamycin (100 mg
mL-1) was used for antibiotic resistance selection. Blue/
white colony screening was done on LB agar plates using
80 mg mL-1 X-gal and 0.5 mL L-1 of 100 mM isopropyl-βD-thiogalacto-pyranoside (IPTG) to select the positive
colonies.

DNA sequencing reactions were carried out using the ABI
PRISM® BigDye® terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (BDV3.1) according to manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA). DNA
sequencing was carried out using an ABI PRISM® 3100
automated DNA sequencer.

website. Multiple sequence alignment was done using
DNAMAN and online DIALIGN Multiple Sequence Alignments tool at BiBiServ [37]. A neighbor-joining tree was
constructed using DNAMAN version 4.1.5.1 (Lynnon BioSoft).
Molecular modeling
Three dimensional structures of three-finger toxins from
Desert Massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus edwardsii) venom
gland transcriptome were modeled using the online ITASSER server for protein 3D structure prediction [38].
The server predicts the folds and secondary structure by
profile-profile alignment (PPA) threading techniques. For
each protein, 3–4 models were obtained. The model with
the lowest free energy was used for further analysis. Ribbon structure diagrams and surface charge models were
created using the DS ViewerPro software to compare
potential differences in electrostatic charges of these
viperid 3FTx.
