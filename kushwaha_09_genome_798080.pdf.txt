Abstract
Background: In Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh and Oryza sativa L., a large number of genes encode
proteins of unknown functions, whose characterization still remains one of the major challenges.
With an aim to characterize these unknown proteins having defined features (PDFs) in plants, we
have chosen to work on proteins having a cystathionine -synthase (CBS) domain. CBS domain as
such has no defined function(s) but plays a regulatory role for many enzymes and thus helps in
maintaining the intracellular redox balance. Its function as sensor of cellular energy has also been
widely suggested.
Results: Our analysis has identified 34 CBS domain containing proteins (CDCPs) in Arabidopsis and
59 in Oryza. In most of these proteins, CBS domain coexists with other functional domain(s), which
may indicate towards their probable functions. In order to investigate the role(s) of these CDCPs,
we have carried out their detailed analysis in whole genomes of Arabidopsis and Oryza, including
their classification, nomenclature, sequence analysis, domain analysis, chromosomal locations,
phylogenetic relationships and their expression patterns using public databases (MPSS database and
microarray data). We have found that the transcript levels of some members of this family are
altered in response to various stresses such as salinity, drought, cold, high temperature, UV,
wounding and genotoxic stress, in both root and shoot tissues. This data would be helpful in
exploring the so far obscure functions of CBS domain and CBS domain-containing proteins in plant
stress responses.
Conclusion: We have identified, classified and suggested the nomenclature of CDCPs in
Arabidopsis and Oryza. A comprehensive analysis of expression patterns for CDCPs using the
already existing transcriptome profiles and MPSS database reveals that a few CDCPs may have an
important role in stress response/tolerance and development in plants, which needs to be validated
further through functional genomics.

Background
All eukaryotic genomes sequenced so far, contain a
number of genes that encode for proteins whose functions
are still unknown. These proteins have been documented
to be induced under specific set of conditions and participate in protein-protein interactions and/or sometimes are
also associated with mutant phenotypes [1]. These proteins with unknown functions are either called proteins
with obscure features (POFs) when they contain no previously defined domains/motifs, or proteins with defined
features (PDFs) when they contain at least one previously
defined domain/motif [1,2]. A protein domain is an evolutionarily conserved unit of protein sequence that can
evolve, function and exist independently of the rest of the
protein chain. In general, each domain is assumed to perform a specific function. An identical domain may appear
in evolutionarily and functionally unrelated proteins, and
therefore it is challenging to relate the presence of a
domain with overall functionality of the protein. One of
the possible approaches to address this important issue is
to use the microarray data as a tool to predict the function
of proteins having unknown functions, as suggested [3].
Recently, a number of these kinds of proteins have been
characterized in Arabidopsis and Oryza using transcriptome
studies as well as functional genomics tools, by raising
transgenic plants. It has been reported that some of these
proteins of unknown function(s) can indeed improve tolerance of transgenic plants to oxidative stress [4].
To understand the probable mechanism of abiotic stress
tolerance in Oryza sativa, we have made an attempt to
characterize several unknown members of the stress
responsive machinery [5]. A group of these proteins of
unknown functions were found to have cystathionine-synthase (CBS) domain and were differentially regulated
in the contrasting genotypes of rice indicating towards
their probable role in salinity tolerance. Thus, we assume
that these proteins may be participating in known pathways and networks and/or be involved in basic or specialized processes and also might comprise new and
undiscovered pathways.
CBS domains are found to be associated with several proteins of unrelated functions, such as inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK), chloride channels (CLC) and cystathionine--synthase (CBS). The importance of CBS
domain was realized by the observation that point mutations in the CBS domain cause several hereditary diseases
in humans [6]. CBS domain was first discovered by Bateman [7] in the genome of the archaebacterium Methanococcus jannaschii as a conserved domain in a group of
proteins. CBS domain exists not only in archaebacterial
proteins, but also in eubacterial and eukaryotic proteins
[6]. The name of the CBS domain was coined after its dis-

covery in human CBS enzyme, which is the first enzyme
involved in the reverse transsulfuration pathway in which
homocysteine is converted to cysteine via cystathionine.
In plants and bacteria, transsulfuration pathway operates
in forward direction leading to conversion of cysteine to
homocysteine by the action of cystathionine--synthase
and -cystathionase. While in mammals, reverse transsulfuration pathway is found in which cysteine is derived
from homocysteine by CBS and -cystathionase enzymes
(Figure 1). Yeast and some archaebacteria possess both
transsulfuration pathways [8].
In CBS protein, C-terminal CBS domain exerts an autoinhibitory effect on the CBS activity, while binding of SAM
(S-adenosylmethionine) with CBS domain induces a conformational change which relieves the autoinhibitory
effect. Mutation in CBS domains abolish or strongly
reduce activation by SAM and cause homocystinuria. CBS
domain of -subunit of AMPK acts as sensor of cellular
energy status and mutations cause a glycogen storage disease, which is clinically expressed as a familial hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy
(Wolff-Parkinson-White
syndrome) [9-12]. Scott et al. [13] reported that CBS
domain of IMPDH binds to ATP in a positive cooperative
way and activates IMPDH. ATP binding and activation
was abolished by a point mutation which corresponds to
the mutation causing retinitis pigmentosa [14]. Earlier
research shows that the CBS module in ATP-binding cassette transporter OpuA constitutes the ionic strength sensor whose activity is modulated by the C-terminal anionic
tail [15]. In CLCs, function of CBS domain remains unre-

solved and controversial. However, it has been shown that
CBS domains in human CLCs are required for its function
and/or expression because mutations in the CBS domain
of CLCs cause diseases due to CLC dysfunction [16-21].
However, in plants information available on CLCs is very
limited. The first CLC gene (CLC-Nt1) was identified from
tobacco [22], thereafter CLC genes were identified and
characterized from Arabidopsis [23-25] and rice [26], but
function of CBS domain in these CLC channel genes has
not been resolved.
The availability of complete genome sequence along with
the microarray expression and Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) data makes Arabidopsis an ideal
plant for study of newly identified protein family [27]. In
the present work, we have performed genome wide analysis in the two highly finished plant genomes i.e. Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa where we have identified
and classified the CDCPs based on their conserved features. To further establish their possible involvement in
development and abiotic stresses, we have analyzed the
expression of genes encoding CDCPs using MPSS database and already existing Arabidopsis microarray database
http://www.arabidopsis.org.

Results and Discussion
Identification and classification of CBS domain containing
proteins
In the present study, we provide information on the
CDCPs in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. For this,
the CDCPs were searched against the protein sequence
database for Arabidopsis and Oryza, using the HMM profile
of CBS domain obtained from Pfam database as described
earlier [28]. We propose a systematic classification of all
the CDCPs based on their structural features, as there are
no pre-existing reports on classification of CDCPs, till
date.

Whole genome analysis of Arabidopsis and Oryza, employing the standard bioinformatics tools (described in methods), identified a total of 34 proteins (encoded by 33
genes) in Arabidopsis and 59 proteins (encoded by 37
genes) in Oryza with a distinct CBS domain (Table 1).
These proteins could be classified into two major groups
comprising of proteins containing only a single and those
with two CBS domains. Apart from CBS domain, some of
these proteins also possess other structural domains based
on which we have further classified these proteins into
subgroups. Single CBS domain containing proteins were
further classified into 6 subgroups in Arabidopsis, while in
Oryza CDCPs were classified into 7 subgroups. Two CBS
domain containing proteins were classified into 2 subgroups in both, Arabidopsis and Oryza (Figure 2). The other
observed structural domains were: CorC_HlyC [29,30],
voltage chloride channel (CLC) [31-33], sugar isomerase

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/200

(SIS) [34,35], pentatricopeptide repeats (PPR) [36-38],
Phox and Bem1p (PB1) [39-41] and inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) [14]. Some of the members of the CBS domains containing proteins also possess
domain of unknown function (DUF21), while few other
proteins only possess the CBS domain(s) in their
sequences. In Arabidopsis, 25 proteins containing a single
CBS domain were found which are encoded by 24 genes
since one gene encoded for two alternate splice variants,
whereas in Oryza 46 proteins containing a single CBS
domain were found to be encoded by 37 genes. Interestingly, in Oryza an additional class of CDCPs having
IMPDH domain was observed, which was not found in
Arabidopsis. The existence of more number of CDCPs in
Oryza is due to alternative splice events which correspond
to the earlier report where it has been shown that in Oryza
36,650 alternate splicing events affected 8,772 genes,
while in Arabidopsis 16,252 alternate splicing events
affected 5,313 genes [42]. In case of two CBS domain containing proteins, 9 genes encode for 9 proteins in Arabidopsis, as no case of alternative splicing was observed,
whereas in Oryza 8 genes encode for 13 proteins. The
nomenclature has been assigned according to the
domain(s) present in the given sequence such as CBSX for
proteins containing only a single CBS domain,
CBSDUFCH1 for protein containing one CBS domain
along with DUF and CorC_HlyC domains, CBSCLC for
proteins containing one CBS domain and a CLC domain,
CBSDUF for proteins containing one CBS domain and a
DUF domain, CBSSIS for proteins containing one CBS
domain and a SIS domain and CBSPPR for proteins containing one CBS and a PPR domain CBSIMPDH for proteins containing one CBS domain along with an IMPDH
domain. Whereas, for two CBS domain containing proteins, CBSCBS nomenclature was given to the proteins
containing only two CBS domains, and CBSCBSPB for
proteins containing two CBS domains and one PB1
domain (Figure 2). A prefix At in case of A. thaliana and
Os in case of O. sativa proteins was assigned. For convenience, the alternative spliced forms were named as the
gene name followed by postscript alphabets such as 'a', 'b'
and so on.
Analysis of CBS domain containing proteins
Whole genome analysis of CDCPs in Arabidopsis reveals
the presence of 24 genes which code for 25 proteins containing only single CBS domain, while in Oryza 29 genes
coding for 46 proteins containing only single CBS domain
were found. In case of two CBS domain proteins, 9 genes
code for 9 proteins in Arabidopsis, while in Oryza 8 genes
code for 13 proteins [Table 1]. These proteins were further
classified on the basis of additional domain(s) present
within the sequence. The different sub-classes of these
proteins are as follows:

A. CBSX
A fraction of predicted CBS domain-containing proteins
harbor only single CBS domain (PF00571). CDCPs have
been reported to have the regulatory functions http://
www.sanger.ac.uk/Users/agb/CBS/CBS.html, however the
biological significance of these domains remains to be
elucidated. These CDCPs can act as binding domains for
adenosine derivatives and may regulate the activity of
attached enzymatic or other domains [43]. In some cases,
these proteins may act as sensors of cellular energy status
as they are activated by AMP and inhibited by ATP [44].
Recently, one of the Arabidopsis CBSX proteins (CDCP2)
has been purified and crystallized [45]. In case of Arabidopsis, 6 genes were found to encode for 6 CBSX proteins,
while in Oryza, a total of 22 CBSX proteins were categorized in this subgroup, which were encoded by 12 genes.
In Oryza, all the CBSX genes code for only one protein,
except for OsCBSX3, OsCBSX4 and OsCBSX7, which code
for 5, 6 and 2 proteins, respectively through the alternate
splicing mechanism.
B. CBSDUFCH
In case of Arabidopsis, this subgroup contains two proteins
which are encoded by two genes, while in case of Oryza,
two proteins are encoded by a single gene. These proteins
contain a domain of unknown function (DUF21)
(PF01595) at the N-terminus adjacent to a CBS domain

and a CorC_HlyC domain (PF03471) at the C-terminus.
DUF21 domain has no known function and is usually
present at the N-terminus of the proteins adjacent to a
CBS domain. The CorC_HlyC is a transport associated
domain and is found at the C-terminus of the proteins.
CorC_HlyC domain is also found in magnesium and
cobalt efflux protein CorC and some of the Na+/H+ antiporters. The function of this domain is unknown but it
might be involved in modulating the transport of ion substrates http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk.
C. CBSDUF
Proteins classified in this subgroup contain a DUF21
domain at the N-terminus, along with a CBS domain. In
case of Oryza, this subgroup contains four proteins, which
are encoded by three genes, as OsCBSDUF1 gene codes for
two proteins whereas, in case of Arabidopsis, this subgroup
contains seven proteins, which are encoded by seven
genes.
D. CBSCLC
These proteins belong to chloride channel protein (CLC)
family which sustains a wide variety of cellular functions,
including membrane excitability, synaptic communication, transepithelial transport, cell volume recognition,
cell proliferation, and acidification of endosomes and lysosomes. Earlier chimeric and deletion approaches had

Figure 2
Representation (unscaled) of the primary domain structure of the CDCP proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa
Representation (unscaled) of the primary domain structure of the CDCP proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana and
Oryza sativa. All the CDCPs were classified into two groups; single CBS domain containing proteins and two CBS domain
containing proteins. Single CBS domain containing proteins were further classified into seven subgroups based on the additional domain(s) present in their sequences. Proteins containing only single CBS domain and no other functional domain were
named as CBSX. Other proteins containing single CBS domain were named according to the presence of other functional
domain. Two CBS domain containing proteins were classified into two subgroups. Proteins containing only two CBS domains
and no other functional domain were named as CBSCBS and proteins containing two CBS domains and one PB1 domain were
named as CBSCBSPB. The subfamily CBSIMPDH was observed only in O. sativa.

suggested that CBS domain may influence gating of CLCs.
Past studies have suggested that mutation in the CBS
domain affects protein-protein interaction within CLC
protein subunits as well as between two subunits of the
dimer and that they influence the voltage dependence of
gating through the common gate [46]. Role of CBS
domain in the correct targeting (possibly related to correct
folding) of the CLC is in accordance with previous studies
with yeast CLC protein where mutation in the CBS
domain abolished its localization to the late golgi that is
seen upon its overexpression [47]. Earlier experiments
have shown that certain mutations in CBS domain affect
chloride channel gating but physiologically relevant regulatory role of CBS domains in CLC channels is yet to be
established [46]. In an earlier report, 7 CLC genes were
identified each from Oryza and Arabidopsis [48]. However,
in the present study we have identified total 10 genes
encoding 14 CLC proteins in Oryza. Whereas in case of

Arabidopsis, our results are in accordance with the previous
report as we found 8 CLC proteins encoded by 7 genes.
E. CBSSIS
Proteins containing sugar isomerase (SIS) domain along
with a CBS domain have been classified in this subgroup.
We have identified one CBSSIS gene encoding only one
protein in cases of both, Arabidopsis and Oryza. The SIS
domain is widespread and found in all species including,
prokaryotic, archaebacterial and eukaryotic proteins. In
general SIS domain is found in proteins that have a common role in phosphosugar isomerization as SIS domain
functions by binding to the phosphosugars. The SIS
domains are also found in a family of bacterial transcriptional regulators [34] as well as in a family of Escherichia
coli iron transporters [49].

F. CBSPPR
In both Arabidopsis and Oryza, this subgroup is composed
of a single gene encoding for a single protein, containing
a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motif and a CBS
domain. The PPR motif, first described by Small et al. [36]
is a degenerate 35 amino acid sequence closely related to
the 34 amino acid tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) motif.
PPR repeat motifs are structural motifs encoded by a large
number of genes in plants and other organisms, although
the PPR gene family is greatly expanded in plants. It was
hypothesized that this could be due to novel functions
served by PPR proteins in plants that are not required in
other organisms, or that PPR proteins replace functions
performed by other genes in other organisms. Also, restoration of male fertility is a plant specific function encoded
by PPR genes [50]. A genome-wide analysis of Arabidopsis
PPR family proteins has identified 441 members and their
further analysis revealed that PPR proteins play constitutive, often essential roles in mitochondria and chloroplast, probably via binding to organeller transcripts [51].
Many plant PPR genes that have been functionally annotated so far, are involved in either male fertility restoration
through modification or silencing of cytotoxic mitochondrial transcripts, or post transcriptional modulation of
plastid gene expression or plant embryogenesis and other
plant developmental processes [52]. Interestingly, among
large number of PPR proteins found in plants, only one
PPR protein, each in Oryza and Arabidopsis, contains a CBS
domain in the same reading frame. Occurrence of CBS
domain along with PPR repeat in a protein suggests that
this protein might be involved in the various cellular processes by sensing the cell energy status [13]. Structurally
characterizing the full length protein (PPR + CBS domain)
may shed light on this regulatory mechanism in plants.
G. CBSIMPDH
Proteins containing inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) domain (PF00478) along with CBS
domain has been classified in this subgroup. In Oryza,
only one CBSIMPDH gene has been identified, which
code for two CBSIMPDH proteins while in Arabidopsis, no
member of this subgroup has been identified. Interestingly, in Oryza CBSIMPDH proteins, CBS domain lies
within the IMPDH domain. IMPDH domain has been
identified in the sequence of IMPDH enzyme, which is a
key enzyme in the de novo guanosine nucleotide biosynthesis. Scott et al. [13] have shown that the CBS domain
of IMPDH binds to ATP in vitro and that the tetrameric
IMPDH binds ATP in a positive, cooperative way. They
have also observed that IMPDH was activated by ATP,
which was never reported earlier. This observation
strongly supported the verity that ATP binding to the CBS
domain allosterically activates IMPDH and consequently
XMP synthesis. If so, this mechanism would couple the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/200

GTP/dGTP biosynthesis to the cellular energy status i.e.,
high ATP levels [6].
H. CBSCBS
In this subgroup, proteins containing only two CBS
domains have been classified. In case of Oryza, 8 CBSCBS
proteins have been identified, which are encoded by 5 different genes. The OsCBSX7 gene, which has been classified in CBSX subgroup, also codes for a protein
OsCBSCBS1 containing two CBS domains. The
OsCBSCBS4 gene encodes for four proteins through an
alternative splicing mechanism whereas, in case of Arabidopsis, AtCBSCBS subgroup contains four genes, which
encode four proteins.
I. CBSCBSPB
These proteins contain Phox/Bemp1 (PB1) domain along
with the CBS domain. In case of Oryza, this subgroup possess 4 genes, which encode for 4 proteins, while in Arabidopsis 5 CBSCBSPB genes encode for 5 proteins. The PB1
domains are present in many eukaryotic cytoplasmic signaling proteins. They are dimerization/oligomerization
domains present in adaptor and scaffold proteins and
kinases that serve to organize platforms that ensure specificity and fidelity during cellular signaling. Recently, a
number of studies have provided valuable information on
the structural details that govern binding between the different PB1 modules and explain how they direct the formation of different macromolecular signaling complexes
[53]. Proteins containing the PB1 domain are conserved
in animals, fungi, amoebae and plants, which participate
in various biological processes [54]. The function of PB1
domain containing proteins in plants has not been
reported so far. Presence of PB1 domain, along with a pair
of CBS domains, in a single protein suggests that these
proteins might be involved in cellular signaling processes
through interaction with other proteins and/or ligands
(ATP, ADP or SAM). Characterization of these proteins at
physiological, molecular and structural level might shed
some light on their functionality.
Chromosomal distribution of CBS domain containing
proteins
In Arabidopsis, the family of 33 CDCP genes was found to
be distributed randomly on all the 5 chromosomes (Figure 3a), while in Oryza the family of 37 CDCP genes was
distributed on 9 out of 12 chromosomes (Figure 3b). In
case of Arabidopsis, maximum (10 in number) CDCP
genes, were found to be located on chromosome V, followed by 9 on chromosome I, 7 on chromosome IV, 5 on
chromosome III and 2 on chromosome II. While in Oryza
maximum (9 in number) CDCP genes were found to be
located on chromosome I, followed by 7 on chromosome
III, 6 each on chromosome II and IV, 3 on chromosome

VIII, 2 each on chromosomes IX and XII; and 1 each on
chromosomes V and VII.
The distribution of the CDCP genes on the 5 chromosome
of Arabidopsis and 9 chromosome of Oryza, at which they
were found to be located, is not uniform. Their chromosomal distribution pattern reveals that some CDCP genes
are found in clusters on certain chromosomes at various
chromosomal regions. Occurrence of cluster of genes
belonging to a family at certain chromosomes and chromosomal regions is common. Jain et al. [55] have
reported that among the 19 auxin responsive (SAURs)
genes present on chromosome IX, 17 are clustered
together at a single locus in tandem. Similarly, genes
encoding basic leucine zipper transcription factors

(OsbZIP) have also been reported to be present in clusters
at certain chromosomes and chromosomal regions [56].
In Oryza, 4 genes encoding two CBS domain containing
proteins were found in close vicinity at chromosome I.
Percent identity amongst all the four genes clustered was
found to be in the range of 30 to 60%.
The sequence information and analysis of the Arabidopsis
[57-60] and Oryza [61] whole genomes have revealed
numerous large-scale segmental duplications. Several
studies conclude that at least two rounds of duplications
might have probably occurred in the Arabidopsis genome,
with many losses and rearrangements, leaving a mosaic of
"segmental duplications" or "duplication blocks" [61-65].
Analysis of CDCP genes has revealed that some of these

Page 10 of 22
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:200

genes have been duplicated during the process of evolution in both, Arabidopsis and Oryza. Figure 3a shows the
duplicated CDCP genes in Arabidopsis and Figure 3b
shows the duplicated CDCP genes in Oryza. In Arabidopsis,
AtCBSX4 at chromosome I seem to be duplicated segmentally, and a domain duplication event might have
occurred, which have resulted in the appearance of
AtCBSCBS4 gene on the same chromosome.
AtCBSDUFCH2 gene at chromosome I was observed to be
duplicated to chromosome III as AtCBSDUFCH1. These
duplicated genes show 85% identity at the nucleotide
level and 79% identity at the protein level. AtCBSCLC8,
present on the chromosome III seems to be duplicated
segmentally to chromosome V as AtCBSCLC6 and at the
same time the gene observed to have undergone inversion. AtCBSCBSPB2 present at chromosome II seems to be
segmentally duplicated at chromosome III as
AtCBSCBSPB3. These genes share 86% identity at the
nucleotide level and 67% identity at the protein level.
Interestingly in Oryza, it was observed that during the
course of duplication the structural domains accumulate
variations in order to adapt to new function. For example
OsCBSDUF2 gene present on chromosome III got duplicated on chromosome I as OsCBSCBS5. In other instances
the CDCP genes were duplicated but retained their structural domains, like OsCBSCBSPB2 present on chromosome XI got duplicated as OsCBSCBSPB4 on
chromosome XII. OsCBSCLC9 on chromosome II was
found to be duplicated as OsCBSCLC8 on chromosome
VIII. OsCBSCBS2 located on chromosome I was observed
to be duplicated as OsCBSCBS3 on chromosome IV.
Sequence Analysis of CBS domain containing proteins
Sequence analysis of all the CDCPs shows an overall
homology amongst their own respective groups (see Additional files: 1 and 2). Alignment of CBS domain sequences
shows that the conserved domain also possesses some variations within themselves. Single CBS domain proteins of
Oryza have been observed to have a percent identity of
55% to 60% within themselves, and 30% with that of Arabidopsis except for the AtCBSX1 which showed identity of
more than 80% with OsCBSX1 and OsCBSX2. Similar
identity pattern was also observed for the OsCBSCLC proteins, which showed identity ranging from 30% to 80%
within their own subgroups and also with AtCBSCLC proteins. The OsCBSDUF proteins were observed to have
identity ranging from 50% to 60% with the AtCBSDUF
proteins. The OsCBSSIS1 protein shares 80% identity
with AtCBSSIS1 and OsCBSPPR1 protein shares 60%
identity with AtCBSPPR1 protein. OsCBSCBS proteins
share 40% to 75% identity among themselves. The two
CBS domain proteins also showed 50% to 70% identity
with the other two CBS domain members. Apart from
having variations, the CBS domain also accumulates large
insertions. The large insertion or deletion might have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/200

helped the CBS domain proteins to evolve in order to perform specific functions. Results from the sequence alignment suggested that the sequences might have evolved
according to the other functional domains present in the
sequences which might have led to their specialized functions.
Phylogenetic analysis of CBS domain containing proteins
To study the phylogenetic relationship amongst the
CDCPs in both Arabidopsis and Oryza, an unrooted tree
was constructed from the alignment of full length protein
sequences. Analysis of single CBS domain proteins in
both Arabidopsis and Oryza revealed that all the single CBS
domain containing proteins were divided into three
clades (Figure 4). It was observed that all the OsCBSX and
AtCBSX proteins clustered together in single clade, except
for OsCBSX8, OsCBSX9, OsCBSX11, OsCBSX12,
AtCBSX4, AtCBSX5 and AtCBSX6. The OsCBSX11 and
OsCBSX12 proteins were found in the clade with CBSCLC
proteins showing significant identity (52%) with that of
the CBSCLC proteins. The OsCBSSIS1 and AtCBSSIS1
proteins share cluster with majority of OsCBSX and
AtCBSX proteins. It was observed that OsCBSSIS1 and
AtCBSSIS1 proteins share 40% identity with each other.
All the OsCBSDUF and AtCBSDUF proteins were clustered together in the same clade. AtCBSPPR1, OsCBSPPR1
and OsCBSIMPDH proteins were also found to be lying in
the same clade along with CBSDUF proteins. OsCBSIMPDH proteins share 30% to 44% identity with the
CBSDUF proteins. Third clade comprises of the OsCBSCLC and AtCBSCLC proteins and it was also shared by
OsCBSDUFCH1 and AtCBSDUFCH1 proteins. Analysis of
two CBS domain containing proteins in Arabidopsis and
Oryza clearly showed three clades (Figure 5). The OsCBSCBSPB and AtCBSCBSPB proteins were observed to be
clustered together in one clade, while OsCBSCBS and
AtCBSCBS proteins were found to be divided in two separate clades. The first clade represented all the CBSCBS proteins except for OsCBSCBS4 and AtCBSCBS3. The large
number of alternative splicing observed in OsCBSCBS4
resulted in the separate clade showing the amount of variation adopted by these proteins with respect to the other
OsCBSCBS proteins. When observed at the sequence level
OsCBSCBS4 was found to have 50% to 60% identity with
other CBSCBS members. OsCBSCBS5 protein was found
to be closer to the OsCBSCBS4 protein showing an
increase in the copy number of the protein in Oryza due
to evolution which might be caused in order to adapt for
specific function. These results suggest that the CBS
domain containing proteins might have evolved differentially in order to adapt to the specific functions.

MPSS analysis of genes encoding CBS domain containing
proteins
Massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) provides
a sensitive quantitative measure of gene expression for
nearly all genes in the genome [66]. To study the expression of CDCP genes in various tissues/organs under different conditions, we extracted the information about the
MPSS tags available for both 17 base and 20 base libraries
representing 6 different parts of the plant from Arabidopsis
MPSS Project http://mpss.udel.edu/at/ and Oryza MPSS
project http://mpss.udel.edu/rice/ (see Additional files: 3
and 4). The heatmaps generated from these data are presented as Figure 6 and 7.

Analysis of CDCP genes in Arabidopsis and Oryza showed
that AtCBSX4 has no expression value in any of the tissues
under any condition according to the MPSS database

while in Oryza OsCBX12 has no expression values in the
MPSS database. In Arabidopsis, genes encoding for proteins with CorC_HlyC functional domain, which has a
major role in magnesium and cobalt efflux, along with
CBS domain seems to be expressed more in siliqua, leaves
and inflorescence. In Oryza, OsCBSDUFCH1 gene was
observed to show more expression in leaves and other
plant tissues, except roots. The gene AtCBSDUFCH1 is
expressed more in inflorescence of ap1-10, ap3-6 mutants
than in the normal condition of inflorescence.
AtCBSDUFCH2,
which
is
duplicated
from
AtCBSDUFCH1 on chromosome III, is expressed more in
leaves and seed. In case of Arabidopsis, CBSCLC genes
showed more expression in callus, roots and leaves overall
in the MPSS analysis, while in case of Oryza, OsCBSCLC7
seems to be more expressed in root tissues, while other
members were found to be expressed more in aerial part

CBSIMPDH1 genes were observed to maintain a constant
level of expression in all the plant tissues.

Whereas in Oryza, OsCBSCBSPB3 was observed to show
expression in the meristematic tissues and root while rest
of the genes of this subclass were found to have been
expressed in leaves also. In Arabidopsis, AtCBSCBSPB1
showed more expression in callus, root and normal inflorescence, while AtCBSCBSPB2 showed expression only in
normal inflorescence and siliqua. This data indicates that
CDCP genes exhibit a strict tissue specific expression
which is also developmentally controlled.

Among the groups of genes having two CBS domains,
MPSS analysis showed higher expression for all the
CBSCBS genes in all the plant parts in Oryza, whereas in
case of Arabidopsis, AtCBSCBS4 does not show expression
in any of the plant part considered for the MPSS analysis.
AtCBSCBS2 showed enhanced levels of expression in normal inflorescence, leaves and callus. While, AtCBSCBS3
showed expression in other inflorescence such as ap1-10,
ap3-6 and agamous mutant conditions but does not show
any expression in the normal inflorescence.

Expression profiles of genes encoding CBS domain
containing proteins under various stresses
To examine the expression of CBS domain containing
proteins under various abiotic stress conditions in Arabidopsis, we took advantage of the available data on transcriptional
profiling
http://www.arabidopsis.org/.
Analysis of microarray data indicated that some of the
CDCP genes are regulated by various abiotic stress conditions (Figure 8 and 9).

In Arabidopsis, AtCBSCBSPB1, AtCBSCBSPB2 and
AtCBSCBSPB3 showed expression in MPSS analysis.

may express as many as hundreds of cold shock proteins

under cold stress condition. CDCP genes showed altered
expression at 24 hr cold stress in root with respect to the
control, while in shoot some of the CDCP genes showed
early upregulation within 30 min and 1 hr of cold stress.
Some of the CDCP genes also showed up regulation at 12
hr to 24 hr cold stress conditions. AtCBSSIS1 gene was
found to be upregulated in shoots under cold and wound
stresses, while in roots, upregulation was observed only
under osmotic and salt stresses. In roots, AtCBSDUF3 and
AtCBSCLC7 showed upregulation in cold stress condition
at 12 hour and 24 hour. Under cold stress condition
AtCBSCBSPB4 and AtCBSCBSPB5 showed upregulation
within 24 hrs in roots but in shoots they showed biphasic
upregulation i.e. their expression was upregulated within
30 min of stress, followed by downregulation of expression and it was again upregulated within 24 hr of the
stress exposure. High (intense) light stress causes the formation of oxygen radicals in chloroplasts and has the

potential to damage them. However, plants are able to
respond to this stress and protect chloroplasts by various
means, including transcriptional regulation in the
nucleus. Although the corresponding signaling pathway is
unknown, there have been attempts to study its regulation
[68]. When exposed to UV light, CDCP genes showed
upregulation at 24 hr exposure in roots (also expressed at
early timepoints), while in shoot, UV light exposure from
1 to 3 hrs is found to be sufficient to induce the expression
of CDCP genes. Most of the CDCP genes maintain a constant level of expression during all the time period of the
UV exposure suggesting that these genes might play crucial role(s) in the light sensing mechanism. The complex
responses of plants to wounding have been extensively
studied in recent years, and numerous wound-responsive
genes have been identified in Arabidopsis [69]. Wounding
stress in shoot showed comparable expression at all the
time points while in roots CDCP genes showed expression

at 1 hr and 24 hr of exposure to stress. When exposed to
the genotoxic stress, the cell cycle is halted to gain necessary time for repairing DNA and genes required for repair
and protection of other cellular components endangered
by the genotoxic stress are activated. Some organisms do
respond to the abiotic stresses by way of apoptosis i.e.
eliminating the damaged cell [70]. On exposure to bleomycin (genotoxic), CDCP genes showed differential
expression in root and shoot at all the time points except
for the 6 hr in shoot, where none of the gene showed
enhanced expression. This data indicates that the CDCPs
might also play role in protecting the cells from the genotoxic stress. Under drought conditions, plants adapt themselves to maintain the cellular homeostasis. It has been

observed that sensitive plants suffer rapid irreversible cell
damage, essentially due to degradation of their membranes [71]. Membranes are main targets of degradative
processes induced by drought and it has been shown that,
under water stress, a decrease in membrane lipid content
is correlated to the inhibition of lipid biosynthesis [72,73]
and a stimulation of lipolytic and peroxidative activities
[74-77]. When observed under drought conditions, all
CDCP genes showed comparable expression at different
time points in root, while in shoot approximately all the
CDCP genes were found to be upregulated at 24 hr
drought stress, which indicates that plant takes some time
to adapt to the drought conditions, suggesting that
CDCPs might also help plants to adapt to drought stress.

This analysis revealed two important facts about the
CDCP genes. On the one hand, we could identify some
members (such as AtCBSX2, AtCBSX3, and AtCBSCBS1;
three in total) whose expression was found to be unaltered under any stress conditions, in either roots or
shoots. On the other hand, some genes could be identified (such as AtCBSX1 and others shown in Figure 10; sixteen in total) which were found to be differentially
expressed with respect to the control under all the stress
conditions in both, roots and shoots. Similarly, members
such as AtCBSDUFCH2, AtCBSDUF1, AtCBSDUF2 and
AtCBSCBS2 were altered under all stresses only in roots
(four in total). In contrast, two genes (AtCBSX6 and
AtCBSCLC8) could also be identified which were differentially expressed under all stresses only in shoots. It was
also observed that more CDCP genes were differentially
regulated under all stresses in roots tissues (20 in total)
than in shoot tissues (18 in total).

Salt and osmotic stress result in transient increase in a
cytoplasmic free calcium concentration, and disruption of
this calcium gradient affects downstream gene expression
[78]. Earlier, some attempts have been made to identify
the osmotic stress related genes in Arabidopsis [79]. Under
the condition of osmotic stress, expression of some of the
CDCP genes was found to be altered with respect to the
control in 30 min and 12 hr stress in roots, while in shoots
these genes showed higher expression at 1 hr and 24 hr of
osmotic stress. Under salt stress, CDCP genes were found
to be up regulated at 1, 6 and 12 hr time points in roots,
while in shoots these genes were expressed more in 1 hr
and 24 hr of salt stress. The analysis of expression of these
genes gives an idea that CBS domain containing proteins
might play an important role in drought, salt and osmotic
stress response/tolerance. Oxidative stress, arising from an
imbalance in the generation and removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), is a
challenge faced by all aerobic organisms [80,81].
Although ROS were originally considered to be detrimental to cells, it is now widely recognized that redox regulation involving ROS is a key factor modulating cellular
activities [82]. Oxidative stress seems to induce the expression of CDCP genes at 3 hr of stress in roots while in shoot
almost all the CDCP genes, which were differentially
expressed showed upregulation under oxidative stress.

The cystathionine -synthase (CBS) domain containing
proteins (CDCPs) comprise of a large superfamily of evolutionarily conserved proteins which are present in all
kingdoms of life. In plants, CDCPs were never reported
and hence their occurrence and possible function is still a
mystery. The present study has identified CDCPs in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa at the whole genome level.
We also propose their classification based on the presence
of CBS domain and various other functional domain(s)
present in them. The chromosomal position of genes
encoding CDCPs gives an insight into their distribution in
the whole genome of Arabidopsis and Oryza. In addition,
MPSS analysis reveals the differential expression of these
genes in various tissues and parts under stress conditions
in these plant species. Moreover, microarray expression
data gives an overview that the CDCPs might play an
important role in stress response/tolerance in Arabidopsis
under various stress conditions. Thus, it can be concluded
that CDCP genes exhibit strict stress and developmentally
regulated expression patterns in Arabidopsis and Oryza.
Certainly, there is a need to functionally validate the role
of these CDCPs which exhibit "induced expression patterns" under multiple stresses. Another major finding of
this work is the observed expansion of CDCP gene family
in Oryza as compared to Arabidopsis. This expansion has
been noticed in Oryza primarily because of presence of relatively more cases of alternative splicing as well as gene
duplications, possibly indicating towards the significant
involvement of CDCPs in development and stress
responses. This study will be helpful in commenting on
the structural and functional aspects of these unexplored
proteins with respect to their roles under various abiotic
stresses. Tools of functional genomics based on transgenic
approach can further help in testing the "candidature" of
these proteins with defined features towards improving

stress tolerance in crop plants. The leads provided here
would also pave the way for elucidating the precise role of
individual CDCP proteins in plants.

Methods
Search and analysis of CBS domain containing proteins
The CDCP protein sequences were retrieved from whole
genome sequences of Arabidopsis thaliana (TIGR version 5
and TAIR 8) and Oryza sativa (TIGR version 6). The
sequences obtained from TIGR were also cross checked
with TAIR8 sequences for any new instances of CDCP proteins in Arabidopsis. The domain structure of the CBS was
used to identify and classify the CDCP proteins using the
TIGR A. thaliana genome sequence version 5.0 and O.
sativa version 6.0. Profiles unique to the CBS domain were
used to screen all predicted proteins using the HMMER
software (version 2.3.2; http://hmmer.wustl.edu/. These
unique profiles are for Pfam HMM of CBS domain (accession no. PF00571) [83]. We have used these profiles as
default parameters in the hmmsearch program of the
HMMER package [84]. All the significant hits having positive scores were selected for classification and were then
examined individually for accessory domains that are usually present. This was accomplished by searching the
sequences against the Pfam database (version 21.0) to
map the known domains, such as Voltage_CLC,
CorC_HlyC, SIS, PB1, DUF21 and IMPDH1 (see Fig. 2 for
a schematic representation). This step, besides mapping
accessory domains to the CBS provides the basis of classifying these proteins. The percentage values of the
sequence similarity and identity within the groups were
obtained using BLAST. The respective CDCP protein
sequences were also cross checked from the TAIR8 database for presence of any additional alternative splice
forms in Arabidopsis.

For convenience, we have assigned name to protein
sequence according to the domains observed in the
respective protein sequence, where At is for Arabidopsis
thaliana and Os is for Oryza sativa. The chromosomal positions of the CDCP genes were obtained from TIGR version
6 for O. sativa and TIGR version 5, TAIR version 8 for A.
thaliana, and plotted using Dia version 0.96.1, an open
source gtk+ based diagram creation program.
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis
Multiple alignment analyses were performed using MUSCLE (version 3.6) program [85]. The unrooted parsimonious tree was plotted using protpars and drawtree program
of phylip package (version 3.66) [86] using default
parameters. Similarity and identity values among the protein sequences were analyzed using standalone BLAST
(version 2.2.15) [87]. The figures for final alignment were
prepared using Jalview multiple sequence alignment editor [88].

Expression analysis using MPSS database
Expression evidence from MPSS (Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing) tags was determined from the Arabidopsis
MPSS project http://mpss.udel.edu/at/ mapped to Arabidopsis and Oryza gene models. The signature was considered to be significant if it uniquely identifies an individual
gene and shows perfect match (100% identity over 100%
length of the tag). The normalized abundance (tags per
million, tpm) of these signatures for a given gene in a
given library represents a quantitative estimate of expression of that gene.
