evolutionary arms race between host two endosymbiotic polydnaviruses from Glyptapanteles parasitic wasps reveals new insights into the
<p>Comparative genome analysis of sequences
Glyptapanteles polydnavirus genome and parasite.</p>

Abstract
Background: Polydnaviruses, double-stranded DNA viruses with segmented genomes, have evolved as obligate
endosymbionts of parasitoid wasps. Virus particles are replication deficient and produced by female wasps from proviral
sequences integrated into the wasp genome. These particles are co-injected with eggs into caterpillar hosts, where viral
gene expression facilitates parasitoid survival and, thereby, survival of proviral DNA. Here we characterize and compare
the encapsidated viral genome sequences of bracoviruses in the family Polydnaviridae associated with Glyptapanteles gypsy
moth parasitoids, along with near complete proviral sequences from which both viral genomes are derived.
Results: The encapsidated Glyptapanteles indiensis and Glyptapanteles flavicoxis bracoviral genomes, each composed of 29
different size segments, total approximately 517 and 594 kbp, respectively. They are generated from a minimum of seven
distinct loci in the wasp genome. Annotation of these sequences revealed numerous novel features for polydnaviruses,
including insect-like sugar transporter genes and transposable elements. Evolutionary analyses suggest that positive
selection is widespread among bracoviral genes.
Conclusions: The structure and organization of G. indiensis and G. flavicoxis bracovirus proviral segments as multiple loci
containing one to many viral segments, flanked and separated by wasp gene-encoding DNA, is confirmed. Rapid evolution
of bracovirus genes supports the hypothesis of bracovirus genes in an 'arms race' between bracovirus and caterpillar.
Phylogenetic analyses of the bracoviral genes encoding sugar transporters provides the first robust evidence of a wasp
origin for some polydnavirus genes. We hypothesize transposable elements, such as those described here, could facilitate
transfer of genes between proviral segments and host DNA.

Background

The capacity to sequence and analyze complex genomes has
enabled rapid progress toward understanding atypical biological systems, such as the obligate mutualistic association of
polydnaviruses (PDVs) with certain parasitic wasps [1]. PDVs
have evolved a distinctive life strategy as they exist in two distinct forms, as a proviral form integrated into the genome of
male and female parasitoids [2,3], and in a virus form that is
replication deficient. PDV encapsidated genomes are unlike
any other viral genomes as they consist of multiple circular
double-stranded DNA molecules, referred to as segments.
Proviral DNA is amplified from the parasitoid genome, followed by excision, circularization, and encapsidation of segments into virus particles, and occurs only within female
ovarian calyx epithelial cells [4-6]. PDVs are also distinctive
in that they require two separate hosts to maintain their life
cycle. PDV virions are released into the oviduct lumen with no
obvious pathology to the primary host. During oviposition,
virions, wasp eggs and other parasitism-associated factors are
delivered into a secondary host, usually a lepidopteran, where
PDV gene expression disrupts immune functions, physiology,
and development [7-9]. Virion-induced pathology within the
secondary host ensures survival of the PDV proviral form
within the parasitoid life cycle.
Genome sequencing and analyses undertaken to elucidate the
genetic complement of PDVs relating to their unusual biology
have focused mainly on encapsidated viral genomes as isolated from female parasitoid reproductive tracts. Comprehensive genome studies have been conducted for representative
members of the two genera of PDVs, bracoviruses (BVs) and
ichnoviruses (IVs), described as obligate endosymbionts of
braconid and ichneumonid parasitoids, respectively. Braconid parasitoids harboring BVs are monophyletic and comprise the microgastroid complex of seven subfamilies
(Cheloninae, Dirrhoponae, Mendesellinae, Khoikhoiinae,
Cardiochilinae, Miracinae and Microgastrinae) with greater
than 17,500 species [10]. BV genomes sequenced to date are
exclusive to subfamily Microgastrinae, Cotesia congregata
BV (CcBV) [11], and Microplitis demolitor BV (MdBV) [12];
IV genomes sequenced include members from the ichneumonid subfamily Campopleginae, Campolitis sonorensis IV
(CsIV) [12], Hyposoter fugitivus IV and Tranosema rostrale
IV [13], and from subfamily Banchinae, Glypta fumiferanae
IV [14]. General characteristics that differ in sequenced
encapsidated BV and IV viral genomes include segment
number, size and abundance, while similar characteristics
include a low gene coding density, multiple intron-containing
protein coding genes and the presence of multi-gene families
[11-16].
Conventional concepts in virology do not adequately describe
the viral and proviral forms of PDV genomes. Encapsidated
PDV genomes sequenced to date lack known viral structural
proteins and DNA replication-associated enzymes, and there
is evidence that in CsIV, a gene coding for one structural pro-

Volume 9, Issue 12, Article R183

Desjardins et al. R183.2

tein is not encoded by the encapsidated genome [17]. It has
been hypothesized that PDVs have a viral ancestry and have
undergone reductive genome evolution, where replication
and coat protein genes have been transferred to other regions
of the wasp genome [18]. Although PDVs are classified as
viruses [1], a contrasting hypothesis is that PDVs have
evolved from genetic elements that have captured parasitoid
genes and a virion production system [19]. Here, we use the
term viral genome to represent segment sequences encapsidated in virus particles and proviral segment to represent the
linear integrated form of a circular viral genome segment. We
conservatively describe the proviral genome to encompass all
proviral segments and their excision motifs.
PDV viral genome sequences have advanced our understanding of PDV-mediated pathology in parasitism and have begun
to unravel evolutionary relationships of this unusual group of
viruses. However, very little is known about the composition
and sequence of PDV proviral genomes beyond the prediction
of proviral segment sequences. Early studies based on CsIV
showed that several proviral segments were flanked by
genomic DNA that was not encapsidated, suggesting CsIV
proviral segment sequences are dispersed in the wasp
genome [20-22]. In contrast, BV proviral segment sequences
are thought to be located at a single locus in a tandem array
[23-25]. This hypothesis is based on both in situ hybridization
evidence where probes from 3 of 30 different CcBV viral segments hybridized to the same region of a single wasp chromosome [25] and studies of CcBV and Chelonus inanitus BV
(CiBV) in which proviral segments were flanked on one or
both sides by a different proviral segment [23,24]. A direct
DNA sequence repeat was seen at the boundaries of the few
proviral segments examined [23], and it appears to mark the
site of proviral segment excision, possibly via conservative
site-specific recombination, as a single copy of the repeat was
noted within the corresponding circularized viral segment
[23]. A working model for BV viral segment production is that
they are derived from a large precursor molecule encompassing multiple proviral segments, which is amplified after excision of the precursor from the wasp chromosome [26,27].
Studies of CcBV and CiBV show that there is no replication of
mature viral segments [23,26-28].
Recently, we presented a global examination and description
of proviral segment sequences of a BV associated with Glyptapanteles indiensis (GiBV) [15], a parasitoid of gypsy moth.
In contrast to earlier concepts, our data showed that some but
not all of approximately 24 GiBV proviral segment sequences
are tandemly arrayed. We provided the first detailed analysis
of a major part of a PDV proviral genome, a 223 kbp locus
labeled proviral locus 1, which encodes a tandem array of 8
GiBV proviral segments separated by inter-segmental regions
that varies in length from 117 to 8,369 bp [15]. We also proposed that it was reasonable to consider inter-segmental DNA
separating tandemly arrayed proviral segments as components of the proviral genome. Structural and compositional

analyses revealed that this array of proviral segments was
flanked by 6-7 kbp sequence repeats and that proviral segment sequences had a distinct nucleotide composition from
inter-segmental and flanking non-segment DNA. Comparative sequence analysis revealed conserved motifs at the sites
of excision of segments from proviral DNA, which suggested
that there is directionality to the mechanism of segment excision, a conclusion also supported in CiBV [29]. The motifs we
identified are also found in other BV genomes, suggesting a
highly conserved mechanism of BV proviral segment excision. Analyses of DNA polymorphisms in the eight GiBV viral
segment sequences gave evidence for selection acting on both
protein-coding and non-coding DNA, indicating non-coding
segmental DNA may serve functional purposes [15].
Building on our previous work, we have expanded the knowledge of the BV proviral form through detailed analysis of an
additional five loci encoding GiBV proviral segments. Here
we revise our estimate of the GiBV viral segment number to
29, encoded by a minimum of 7 proviral loci, providing a
nearly complete description of the GiBV viral genome. In
addition, we provide equally extensive data showing similar
characteristics of proviral segment sequences of GfBV, a BV
associated with another wasp in the same genus as GiBV, G.
flavicoxis. Comparative analyses reveal a high degree of synteny between loci that code for GiBV and GfBV proviral segments as well as flanking DNA. Not all loci are flanked by
sequence repeat elements, but segment excision motifs have
been conserved. Proviral segment sequences exhibit clear differences in their nucleotide composition relative to flanking
DNA. GiBV and GfBV genes appear to be evolving rapidly,
and GiBV and GfBV contain a novel multi-gene family that
codes for sugar transporter proteins. We also identify a recent
insertion of a transposable element (TE) within a population
of GiBV and more ancient TEs associated with BV genomes.
This work represents the most comprehensive characterization of PDV proviral genomes and of the structural organization of proviral segments to date.

Results and discussion
Sequence characterization of GiBV and GfBV viral
genomes
In an early study, field inversion gel analysis of the GiBV viral
genome estimated the presence of 13 segments and a cumulative viral genome size of approximately 250 kbp [30]. At the
start of our project the viral genome characteristics of GfBV
were unknown, but presumed to be similar to those of GiBV.
We undertook a whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing
approach to sequence the GiBV and GfBV viral genomes.
Viral DNA was sequenced to approximately 8× coverage
using purified virions pooled from the calyx fluid of approximately 400 and 50 female wasps from G. indiensis and G. flavicoxis, respectively (see Materials and methods). Following
a manual effort to close sequence and physical gaps, we were
able to derive a complete consensus viral segment sequence

for 21 GiBV viral segments (8 of which were described previously [15]); 4 segments (numbers 17, 19, 21 and 29) remained
as partial sequences (Figure 1) due to technical difficulties
primarily associated with sequence repeats. GiBV viral segment 25 corresponded to the GiBV genome 'segment F' previously sequenced and characterized in detail [31,32]. For
GfBV, we were able to complete sequence analysis of 27 viral
segments and 1 (number 13) remained a partial sequence
(Figure 1). Nucleotide sequence polymorphisms occurred
more frequently in GiBV than in GfBV, and we presume the
higher sequence success rate for GfBV was due to sampling a
more homogeneous viral population relative to GiBV. The
discrepancy in GiBV viral genome statistics with earlier estimates [30] is due to finding multiple GiBV viral segments of
similar size, which would have co-migrated on the agarose
gel. The 25 GiBV and 28 GfBV viral segment sequences
totaled 489 kbp and 581 kbp, respectively. These aggregate
genome sizes and viral segment numbers have been further
revised based on proviral sequence data (described below).
Individual WGS sequence reads were deposited in the NCBI
Trace Archive [1643848625-1643870960, 18136165621813617310]. Consensus sequence for viral segments, which
ranged in length from 9.7 to 39.0 kbp for GiBV and 3.8 to 50.7
kbp for GfBV have been deposited in GenBank [GenBank:EU001243-EU001285].

Sequence characterization of loci encoding GiBV and
GfBV proviral segments
We previously reported that a radioactive probe from total
GiBV viral DNA hybridized at varying intensity to 127 clones
from a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library of 9,216
clones derived from G. indiensis larvae; 17 GiBV viral segment sequences for which probes were available mapped to
BAC clones that segregated into 7 distinct non-overlapping
groups [15]. A similar size BAC library from G. flavicoxis
yielded 154 clones that hybridized with total GfBV viral DNA.
A combination of BAC end sequencing of 60 BACs and 10
GfBV segment-specific PCRs also segregated these BAC
clones into 7 groups. GiBV and GfBV proviral segment
sequences not present in the selected BAC clones were isolated by rescreening the arrayed BAC libraries with radioactive viral segment-specific PCR products. Probes for GiBV
viral segment number 29 and 30 and GfBV viral segment
number 29 and 31 did not hybridize to any BAC clones, while
hybridizations of a probe for GiBV segment 28 proved to be
false positives. The former may be due to representational
bias in the BAC libraries that were screened.
A total of 11 BAC clones from G. indiensis (2 BAC clones were
from a prior study [15]) and 9 BAC clones from G. flavicoxis
have been sequenced. Clone selection was based on a combination of proviral segment sequence composition, BAC fingerprinting, and BAC end sequencing to try to ensure that the
BAC clones chosen for sequencing contained the greatest possible coverage of proviral segment sequences. The G. indiensis and G. flavicoxis BAC sequence data totaled 1.21 and 1.16

Mbp, respectively. The location of proviral segments within
the BAC clones was determined by sequence alignment of
viral segment sequences, as well as by searching for individual segment excision motifs (see below). Overlapping BAC
sequences were fused, if possible within an inter-segmental
region, to create pseudo-molecule sequences reducing unique
sequence data for G. indiensis and G. flavicoxis to 1.08 Mbp
and 1.00 Mbp, respectively. The length of contiguous
sequences ranged in size from 48.8 to 233.6 kbp for G. indiensis and 91.7 to 279.3 kbp for G. flavicoxis. Sequences were
annotated as described in Materials and methods. These data

have been deposited in GenBank [GenBank:EF710644EF710659; AC191960] was previously submitted [15].

Identification of novel GiBV and GfBV viral segments
Previously, using MEME [33], we discovered a highly conserved 6 bp DNA sequence embedded within an approximately 60 bp motif that appears to function as the site of
excision and circularization of 8 GiBV proviral segment
sequences [15]. The analysis of such motifs was expanded to
encompass all available viral and proviral sequence data for
GiBV and GfBV. Viral, 5' proviral and 3' proviral excision

motifs are shown in Figure 2. There are some differences, primarily outside the hexamer repeat, between the new consensus excision motifs for GiBV and those described previously
[15]. Additionally, the GfBV excision motif is highly similar to
that of GiBV. As we demonstrated before for GiBV, differences between the extended sequence motifs at each end of a
GfBV proviral segment indicate there is directionality to the
mechanism of segment excision from the site of integration.
Using the extended motifs and MAST [34] we searched BAC
sequences in order to detect the boundaries of proviral segment sequences for which we had partial viral segment

sequence data, and we extended this search to all BACs. In
addition to detecting some of the missing viral segment
sequences, MAST predicted the presence of four novel proviral segments for GiBV (numbers 9, 12, 16 and 18) and one
(number 8) for GfBV (Figure 1). All these potential proviral
segments had exact sequence matches to unassembled
sequences in the viral WGS sequence data. Sequence coverage in all cases was below one-fold and viral segment
sequence versions of the novel proviral segments could not be
assembled from the WGS sequence data alone. To determine
whether these sequences represented potential false positives, we searched all inter-segmental and flanking non-seg-

mental regions against the unassembled viral WGS sequence
data and found no evidence for them in the WGS data. Thus,
a combination of the viral and proviral sequence data predicts
that GiBV and GfBV viral genomes each contain 29 segments,
although 3 GiBV and 1 GfBV viral segments remain partially
sequenced (Figure 1).

mately 20 kbp. Additional primers were designed based on an
inter-segmental parasitoid sodium:neurotransmitter symporter gene present in the homologous GfBV region (Figure
3), which were then used in appropriate combination with
GiBV proviral segment 17 and 18 primers. An amplicon of
approximately 3 kbp (symporter to GiBV proviral segment
18) was obtained and end-sequenced (data not shown), verifying the predicted linkage. We were not able to link the large
gap from GiBV proviral segment 17 to the symporter, but the
data strongly support linkage of GiBV proviral segment 17
and 18 as occurs in GfBV. Synthetic oligonucleotides designed
to either side of the gap separating GiBV proviral locus 1
amplified an approximately 5 kbp product and end-sequence
data verified physical linkage of the two loci (data not shown).
The strong syntenic relationships between GiBV and GfBV
proviral genomes argue for the correct assembly and representation of GiBV proviral locus 2 and its linkage to proviral
locus 1 (Figure 3).

Loci encoding GiBV and GfBV proviral segments
exhibit a high degree of synteny
Based on GiBV and GfBV proviral segment location and conservation of gene order and sequence similarity within proviral segments, 27 of the 29 proviral segments were classified
into pairs of segment homologs (Figures 1 and 3). Each member of a segment pair was assigned the same number. Segments 16 and 30 appear to be unique to GiBV, while segments
27 and 31 appear to be unique to GfBV (Figure 1). In addition
to synteny between GiBV and GfBV proviral segments, there
is clear evidence for conservation of gene order and identity
of genes in wasp DNA flanking proviral segment sequences
(Figure 3). These data depict the near entirety of the GiBV and
GfBV proviral segments; loci encoding three GiBV and three
GfBV proviral segments remain to be identified (Figure 1).

The remaining GiBV and GfBV proviral loci (Table 1, Figure
3) contain either a single proviral segment (loci 4-6) or two
proviral segments in tandem array (loci 3 and 7). Locus 6 and
locus 7 sequences are only available for GiBV and GfBV,
respectively, but must exist for both genomes based on viral
segment sequence data (Figure 1). BAC clones containing loci
3-7 do not overlap with each other or with those encoding loci
1 and 2. The genomic context surrounding three proviral segment sequences from each virus remains unknown, and they
could occur as single or tandemly linked sequences. Unless
these proviral segments are linked to the loci we have already
defined (in which case there would be seven loci), our current
data indicate that GiBV and GfBV proviral segment sequences
will occupy eight or nine loci. It remains possible that
sequence analysis of the missing proviral loci may identify
additional viral segment sequences.

The largest region encoding proviral DNA in both species is
represented by two linked proviral loci, 1 and 2. GiBV proviral
locus 1 [15] and GfBV locus 1 consist of 8 proviral segments
each, while GiBV and GfBV proviral locus 2 consists of 12 and
13 proviral segments, respectively (Table 1). Although the
BAC clones we sequenced did not overlap at these loci, consideration of synteny suggests that they are linked (Figure 3).
Synthetic oligonucleotide primers were designed near the
ends of GiBV proviral segment 17 and 18 to close the existing
gap between BAC clones within GiBV locus 2. However, PCR
analysis of pupal stage G. indiensis parasitoid DNA failed,
possibly due the large size of the estimated gap of approxiLocus 2

*Measured from the 5' end of the first segment to the 3' end of the last segment. †Locus 2 contains a single segment with protein tyrosine
phosphatases (PTPs) and two segments with ankyrins (anks). ‡Characteristics of regions of these loci that were not sequenced were hypothesized
based on the equivalent locus in the other (GiBV or GfBV) genome.

We previously described two different long (6-7 kbp) tandem
repeats flanking GiBV proviral locus 1 (named L1R1 and
L1R2) [15]. These repeats were not found to universally flank
the remaining GiBV proviral loci or to flank GfBV proviral
locus 1. A long (7.5-8 kbp) tandem repeat similar to L1R1 was
found in DNA adjacent to GiBV proviral loci 4 and 5 (Figure
3, A repeats) but these repeats were not found in the homologous GfBV proviral loci. An additional smaller (1 kbp) repeat
similar to L1R1 was found on the 3' side of GiBV proviral locus
2. The L1R2 repeat was not found at any other GiBV proviral
loci, although L1R2-like repeats (approximately 1.5 kbp) were
found near GfBV proviral loci 4 and 7 (Figure 3, B repeats).
GiBV proviral locus 6 does have a long (approximately 6 kbp)
tandem repeat on the 3' side (Figure 3, C repeat), although it
does not share sequence similarity to either L1R1 or L2R2.

sequences are visually depicted in Figure 1. These data are
based on the combined sequences derived from BV viral and
proviral segments, which predicts that both BV viral genomes
contain 29 segments, with an aggregated genome size of
approximately 503 and 594 kbp for GiBV and GfBV, respectively. GfBV viral segments are, on average, 12% larger than
their homologous segment in GiBV, which appears to be due
to GfBV-specific tandem duplications of gene clusters. Three
GiBV and one GfBV viral segment sequence could not be finished with either viral WGS or BAC sequence data, and
assuming a 12% size difference between GiBV and GfBV seg-

As found in GiBV proviral locus 1 [15], inter-segmental
regions separating tandemly arrayed proviral segments in
both the GiBV and GfBV proviral genomes are generally small
(<1 kbp) and do not code for proteins. One exception is the
approximately 9 kbp region separating GfBV proviral segments 17 and 18, which codes for a parasitoid sodium:neurotransmitter symporter. As described above, a similar host
gene is likely to exist in the homologous region in G. indiensis.

ment homologs, we estimate that we are missing approximately 14 kbp of GiBV and <1 kbp GfBV viral genome
sequence data. We thus estimate a cumulative viral genome
size to be 517 kbp for GiBV and 594 kbp for GfBV.
The GiBV and GfBV viral genomes are predicted to encode
similar numbers of proteins, 197 versus 193, respectively, and
58% and 63%, respectively, of the genes are predicted to contain introns. Both genomes have a similar average G+C content (35-36%) and protein coding density (32-33%). The
genomes contain many gene families found in other bracoviruses, including protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), viral
ankyrins, C-type lectins, and cystatins; features of these gene
families are listed in Table 3. Encoded PTPs, ankyrins, and
cystatins are mostly predicted to be single exon genes while Ctype lectins are always predicted to be two-exon genes. PTPs
and ankyrins are not predicted to encode signal peptides
while C-type lectins and cystatins are often predicted to
encode them. Additionally, as reported for CcBV and MdBV,
the GfBV and GiBV genomes are predicted to encode a small
number of tRNAs (Table 2).
A high degree of partitioning is seen between viral segment
gene content when the segments are grouped by proviral
locus membership (Table 1). The majority of genes in locus 1
are predicted to encode signal peptides, while few genes in
any other loci are. Loci 1 and 2 both contain many proviral
segments, most of which encode hypothetical proteins of
unknown function and contain one intron. In contrast, the
remaining loci contain only one or two proviral segments and
predominantly encode PTPs and viral ankyrins that are not
predicted to contain introns. A recent study of CiBV showed
that genes on the same viral segment were generally
expressed in the secondary host in the same time period [35].
Since BV viral segments are present in virion DNA preparations in different abundances, the locus-specific partitioning
of GiBV and GfBV proviral segments may represent some
additional form of control over BV viral gene delivery.

Proviral segments and flanking regions show
fundamental sequence differences
Annotation of non-encapsidated DNA sequences flanking
GiBV and GfBV proviral segment sequences predicted the
presence of 78 and 71 genes, respectively. Nine genes that
flank GiBV proviral locus 1 were described previously [15].
Very few flanking genes showed similarity to known virus
(including PDV) genes; those that did are discussed below.
However, many had a high sequence similarity with insect
genes (78% for flanking genes and 29% for segment genes;
BLASTP, E < e-10). Additionally, flanking genes tended to
have more exons per gene than proviral segment genes,
although the difference was not statistically significant (2 ± 1
for segment genes and 3 ± 2 for flanking genes).
Proviral segment and flanking DNA are distinct not only at
the gene level, but on a nucleotide composition level as well.
Previously, we demonstrated that for GiBV proviral locus 1,
proviral segment sequences had nucleotide compositions
similar to each other and distinct from flanking sequences
[15]. We extended the analysis of trinucleotide frequencies to
encompass all available GiBV and GfBV proviral segment,
flanking, and inter-segmental sequence data. The results are
shown in Figure 4. The majority of proviral segment and
flanking sequences cluster into distinct groups, and the short
terminal-branch lengths indicate highly similar composition
within these groups. Inter-segmental regions also tend to
cluster together, although with a higher degree of variation,
indicated by the longer terminal-branch lengths. This was
expected as the generally shorter lengths of inter-segmental
sequences make calculating trinucleotide frequencies less
accurate. These results were consistent across both the GiBV
and GfBV sequence data.

GiBV and GfBV proviral segment genes are evolving
rapidly
As koinobiont endoparasitoids, PDV-carrying wasps develop
as larvae within caterpillars that are still undergoing development. Therefore, they are in an arms race with the caterpillars

and PDVs contribute to survival against attacks by the
immune system of a living caterpillar. Given this situation, it
is plausible to hypothesize that PDV genes on a whole must
evolve rapidly, particularly since conserved genes that typically control viral replication and particle formation appear to
be absent from the viral genome. We utilized sequence divergence between GiBV and GfBV genes to test this hypothesis.
All genes described here were divided into two sets: one
encompassing genes encoded by proviral segments, and one
including flanking genes. Genes were considered orthologs if
they had reciprocal best BLAST hits to each other and
appeared in syntenic positions. Using these criteria, we identified 72 orthologous gene pairs in the proviral segment gene
set and 41 in the flanking gene set.

In order to examine the strength and direction of selection
acting on these genes, the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) was calculated and a histogram
summarizing the results is shown in Figure 5. Detailed results
for each gene pair are shown in Additional data file 1. Flanking wasp genes predominantly have dN/dS values near 0
(median = 0.23, average = 0.38), indicating that they are
under strong negative selection, which is expected for genes
involved in essential cellular processes. On the other hand,

genes are evolving at significantly different rates than flanking genes (p < 0.001).
An alternative explanation for the dN/dS distribution of proviral segment genes centered around 1 could be that we predicted a large number of pseudo-genes, which would be
evolving neutrally; this would spike the dN/dS distribution
near 1. To test this possibility and more accurately assess positive selection, we conducted a more powerful test of selection, the McDonald-Kreitman (M-K) test [36], by comparing
divergence between the 72 orthologous gene pairs to polymorphisms within those genes in the GiBV viral shotgun
sequence data. Results of the test (Table 4) show significant
evidence for positive selection across GiBV genes as a whole
(p = 3 × 10-8), indicating that most of our gene models are not
false predictions and that many GiBV genes are under positive selection. Criticism of the M-K test suggests that a spurious significant result can be produced by purifying selection
acting on slightly deleterious mutations within a species
rather than positive selection between species [37]. However,
it is highly unlikely that slightly deleterious mutations alone
could account for the level of significance found in this analysis.
Closer examination of specific GiBV and GfBV gene families
also revealed evidence of potential positive selection, particularly within PTPs, cystatins, and C-type lectins (Table 3).
PTPs showed a highly significant pattern of positive selection
(p < 0.0001) using the M-K test, despite having an average
dN/dS below 1. Additionally, the C-type lectin and cystatin
analyzed had dN/dS ratios above 1, suggesting that these
genes are also under positive selection. While it is plausible
that gene families that had uniformly low dN/dS values might
be involved in core viral functions such as replication or
encapsidation, the only gene family found with such a dN/dS
distribution was the sugar transporters (average dN/dS =
0.23). As these genes are specific to GiBV and GfBV and not
found in other sequenced BVs, it seems unlikely that they
serve a core viral function.
In contrast to the high levels of positive selection detected
within proviral segment protein coding sequences, we previously reported that, within GiBV proviral locus 1, non-coding
segment DNA appeared to be under purifying selection [15].
However, when the analysis was extended to include all

sequence data, non-coding sites were evolving at comparable
rates to synonymous sites (data not shown). This suggests
that this conservation of non-coding DNA is either restricted
to GiBV proviral locus 1 or that previous results were affected
by limited sample size.

A wasp origin of GiBV and GfBV sugar transporter
genes
Little is known about the origins of PDV genes. Genes that
have sequence similarity to known eukaryotic genes, such as
those encoding PTPs, are thought to have eukaryotic origins
(see [38] for review). However, these gene families have such
diverse sequences within a single PDV genome that phylogenetic analyses have thus far been unable to determine an
exact origin of these genes. Recently, in an analysis of genes
from previously published BV genomes, Bezier et al. [39]
found that no BV genes were more similar to their insect
homologs than their vertebrate homologs, and phylogenetic
analysis did not suggest an insect (or any other) origin for any
BV genes.
Annotation of two pairs of GiBV and GfBV segment homologs
(segments 17 and 18) revealed a novel family of 8 genes with
a surprisingly complex intron-exon structure, consisting of 68 exons in each gene as opposed to an average of 2 ± 1 exons
in other viral genes. The eight genes are predicted to encode
major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter proteins,
which in general transport a wide variety of small solutes
across membranes [40]. The best BLASTP hits for all eight
proteins were matches to predicted insect sugar transporters,
particularly one from the honey bee Apis mellifera and one
from the parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis (approximately
45% amino acid identity to both). Such genes have not been
described within PDV genomes sequenced to date.
Bayesian phylogenetic analysis using a GTR+gamma+I
model was conducted on the 8 GiBV and GiBV sugar transporters and the 16 most similar transporters in insects. Three
sugar transporters from vertebrates were chosen as outgroups, as no other arthropod sugar transporters were
present in the GenBank protein database. The resulting phylogram is shown in Figure 6, with posterior probabilities
given above branches. The GiBV and GfBV sugar transporters
group strongly with an orthologous pair of sugar transporters
from Nasonia and Apis, suggesting that these genes share a
common hymenopteran ancestry. The sugar transporters did
not group with that of the silk moth, Bombyx mori, suggesting that these genes were not acquired from the secondary
host genome. The similarity of these genes to hymenopteran
sugar transporters is likely not due to convergence, as if the
genes were acquired from the secondary host genome, they
would most likely be expressed in the caterpillar host, and
therefore convergence should not drive the genes toward
wasp sugar transporters. The low dN/dS values calculated for
the sugar transporters (Table 3) suggest that they are under
purifying selection. We hypothesize that this, coupled with a

recent acquisition event, is why these genes still so closely
resemble their ancestral wasp genes. It is unclear why the BV
transporters would be under different selective pressures
than other described virus gene families such as PTPs. Nevertheless, this finding provides support for the hypothesis that
a large number of PDV genes have been acquired from their
primary host, but have diverged to such an extent through
positive selection that limited similarity remains with their
ancestral wasp genes.

the TE is much larger, overall, than typical p-elements, which
are only approximately 3 kbp in size. A single copy of the 8 bp
direct repeat exists in BAC clone 2C5, which lacks the TE and
most likely represents a point of replicative insertion for this
class II transposon. The TE insertion does not disrupt a gene.
Inclusion of the TE in the nucleotide composition analysis
shows that the TE strongly groups with flanking sequences,
rather than the segment sequence in which it is inserted (Figure 4).

A transposable element in GiBV proviral segment 11

The TE sequence is not depicted in the proviral locus 2
sequence presented here (Figure 3) as BAC clone 2C5 contained a complete sequence of proviral segment 11 while clone
1C20 did not. In addition, the consensus sequence derived for
GiBV viral segment 11 did not contain the TE. A BLAST search
of the TE against the unassembled GiBV viral WGS sequence
reads revealed four matching reads. These reads matched
internal parts of the TE and the junction between one of the
TE ends and viral segment 11, suggesting the TE is found in
some GiBV viral genomes at a low frequency. We hypothesize
that this TE was recently acquired from the wasp genome,
and has not yet been lost or gone to fixation in the GiBV
genome. If the TE was highly deleterious to the BV genome, it
would be unlikely to be present in the population. While this

The GiBV proviral locus 2 sequence was generated by merging sequences from overlapping BAC clones. One BAC clone
contained an 11,578 bp insertion in proviral segment 11 [GenBank:EU822800], which was not present in the other BAC
clone in the region of overlap. The insertion sequence in BAC
clone 1C20 is predicted to encode a single gene with sequence
similarity to transposase and was bounded by a perfect 8 bp
direct repeat with perfect 49 bp inverted repeats internal to
the direct repeats, suggesting that the sequence is a TE. Analysis of the transposase using ProteinRepeatMask [41] and
CENSOR [42] classified this transposase as Drosophila p-element-like. However, the 8 bp direct repeat (AAATTCCA) is
different from that typical of p-elements (GGCCAGAC), and

TE does not encode any genes other than a transposase, it
does suggest that TEs can enter a BV genome and become
packaged successfully. No evidence of this TE was found in
either viral or proviral GfBV sequence data.

CcBV-like genes are linked with GfBV proviral locus 7
and appear to be derived from Maverick TEs

(Figure 7). The gene homologous to CcBV 31.1 contains a DNA
Pol B2 domain, which in CcBV was annotated as a pseudogene due to a premature translational stop codon [11,43]. The
second and third genes in the block contain an integrase core
domain and a poxvirus-like DNA packaging domain, respectively. The CcBV genes were previously considered 'virus-like'
and were hypothesized to represent ancestral virus genes
within the BV genome [43].

GfBV proviral locus 7 contains proviral segment 28 and a partial sequence of proviral segment 27, and is flanked on one
side by approximately 95 kbp of non-segment DNA (Figures
3 and 7). The latter encodes some common TE elements
(Gypsy retrotransposon and Mariner-like) and, remarkably,
genes with sequence similarity to genes identified in the CcBV
viral genome (Figure 7). Additionally, this region encodes a
PTP gene, which is identical in nucleotide sequence to a PTP
gene at the 3' end of GfBV proviral segment 28 (asterisks in
Figure 7). MAST searches of this region using the GfBV proviral excision motifs did not reveal any potential excision
motifs, and BLAST searches of the region against the
unassembled GfBV viral sequence reads did not reveal any
matching hits, suggesting that this region does not contain
novel GfBV proviral segments.

However, ProteinRepeatMasker [41] and CENSOR [42] identified the block of three genes and the next two downstream
genes (Figure 7) as components of a Maverick TE. Mavericks
are a novel class of giant TEs [44], also known as Polintons
[45]. BLAST searches revealed homologs of all five genes to be
common components of Maverick TEs present in the recently
released genome sequence of the parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis. Nasonia belongs to a lineage of wasps separate from
those carrying PDVs, suggesting that these proteins are not of
BV origin. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the
tandem array of three genes in CcBV segment 31 represents
remnants of a Maverick TE that was transferred to the CcBV
proviral genome and has since become fixed.

The genes similar to those in CcBV include one that has
strong sequence similarity to CcBV hypothetical protein 30.5
and a block of three genes that are homologous to, and in the
same order as, CcBV segment 31 genes 31.1, 31.2, and 31.3

The Maverick-like array of proteins in the GfBV flanking
DNA is missing two components common to all Maverick
TEs: a coiled-coiled domain protein and terminal repeats.
The complete absence of terminal repeats coupled with the

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R183

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/12/R183

maintenance of open reading frames is particularly unusual.
Since TEs cannot function without terminal repeats, TE open
reading frames typically degrade rapidly after their terminal
repeats are lost. This suggests that selection on the wasp
genome is maintaining these open reading frames, although
their potential function is unknown. The abundance of both
TEs and BV-like genes encoded in DNA flanking GfBV proviral locus 7 may indicate that this region is a 'hotspot' for the
movement of DNA between proviral and flanking sequences.
It will be of interest to determine if similar sequences are
present in the homologous GiBV locus.

Conclusion

Here we provide a comprehensive sequence and computational analysis of the viral genome of BVs isolated from two
different Glyptapanteles species, G. indiensis and G. flavicoxis, and an analysis of proviral sequences from which
encapsidated viral genomes are derived. The sequencing of
both BV genomic forms, that is, viral and proviral segments,
was critical in developing a more complete definition of both
the viral genome as well as the structural organization of a
large component of the proviral genome, given that the latter
unexpectedly led to the discovery of four GiBV and one GfBV
viral segment not evident from sequencing the viral genome.
Although GiBV and GfBV proviral segments are not all tandemly arrayed, synteny between the two sets of sequences
and preliminary linkage data for GiBV suggest that approximately 70% of the 29 proviral segments in each genome are
clustered in a single genomic region consisting of two proviral
loci that span a region of approximately 580 kbp. Each locus
contains tandemly arrayed proviral segments separated from
each other by a short stretch of non-segment DNA (Figure 3).
The remaining GiBV and GfBV proviral loci identified contain
either one or two proviral segments. Most of the seven characterized loci are flanked by long stretches of non-segment
DNA that encode insect proteins. Not every proviral locus is
flanked by long tandem repeats, as was reported for proviral
locus 1 [15]. So it is presently unclear how proviral loci are
demarcated within the wasp genome sequence. Qualitative
and quantitative studies of proviral sequences at the time of
production of viral segments will be needed to accurately
delineate the boundaries of amplified proviral sequences. Our
sequence data are not incompatible with the hypothesis that
all proviral loci are linked in a macrolocus, as suggested for
CcBV proviral segments [25,27]. Additional mapping experiments, for example, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis using segment-specific probes or generation of a BAC
tiling path among loci should resolve the spatial relationships
among the GiBV and GfBV proviral loci. If present, a macrolocus encoding proviral segments would exceed 1 Mbp in size.
BVs are thought to have a monophyletic origin about 100 million years ago [46], a hypothesis supported by the high degree
of synteny between GiBV and GfBV proviral loci and flanking

DNA, as well as the highly conserved proviral segment excision motif among BVs [15]. The compositional difference in
sequences at proviral loci could be indicative of independent
origins of BVs, but they could also be the result of selective
pressures from the primary and or secondary host environment. It will be of interest to compare proviral loci from basal
micrograstrines, such as Microplitis, to those of more derived
miscogastrines such as Glyptapanteles. Such comparisons
could determine if there was an ancient site for BV integration
and, if such a site exists, the extent to which it has been conserved. In addition, whole host genome sequence data are
likely to contribute to a more complete understanding of the
evolution of BVs.
The functions and origins of PDV genes are often difficult to
define. Comparative sequence analyses revealed widespread
positive selection across a large number of GiBV and GfBV
genes, which supports their role in an 'arms race' between
virus and caterpillar. This rapid evolution may help to
obscure the origins of many PDV genes. However, GiBV and
GfBV both encode a gene family of sugar transporters not
found in other sequenced PDV genomes. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that these were wasp genes that were moved into
the proviral genome, providing evidence for an insect origin
for these BV genes. This suggests that the proviral BV genome
may be at least partially derived from the wasp genome, and
possibly represents a mosaic of an ancestral virus and more
recently inserted host genes.
Transposable elements represent a plausible mechanism for
acquiring virulence or other desirable genes from the host
[27,47]. Our evidence shows a p-element like and a Mavericklike element associated with BV genomes. Whether the latter
plays a role in BV biology is unknown, although it is interesting to note the similarities between the proposed methods of
replication in Mavericks [45] and PDVs, as both are hypothesized to replicate extrachromosomally from a circular or
stem-loop molecule. Both described TEs, the former recently
acquired and the latter ancient, could have served to move
core viral genes out of the ancestral BV genome to the host
genome and virulence genes into it. Alternatively, genes could
have moved out of the proviral genome by the degradation of
excision motifs of proviral segments, thereby creating
'pseudo-segments' that are no longer encapsidated.

Materials and methods
Rearing of parasitoid wasps
Outbred populations of G. indiensis and G. flavicoxis, solitary
and gregarious endoparasitoids of gypsy moths (Lymantria
dispar), respectively, were maintained at the USDA-ARSBeneficial Insects Introduction Research Unit, Newark, Delaware, until they were moved to Beltsville, Maryland in 2007.
The maintenance protocol and history of the G. indiensis colony was described previously [15]. G. flavicoxis was reared
under the same protocol with the exception that G. flavicoxis

parasitizes late third instar gypsy moth larvae. Cocoons
formed from parasitized hosts were stored at 24°C until adult
parasitoid emergence and then separated by sex. For BAC
library material, G. flavicoxis larvae were dissected from parasitized gypsy moth larvae 10 days post-parasitization, briefly
rinsed in phosphate buffered saline, flash frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored frozen at -80°C.

Virion purification and DNA extraction
Virions were purified from G. indiensis and G. flavicoxis
females using established protocols [48]. Briefly, female
wasps were anaesthetized in 75% ethanol and rinsed in phosphate buffered saline. Ovaries were dissected from the
females in a drop of phosphate buffered saline and ruptured,
draining the calyx fluid. Pooled calyx fluid was subsequently
filtered through a 0.45 μm filter to remove eggs and cellular
debris [49]. Viral DNA was extracted according to established
protocols [30].

Identification of BAC clones containing proviral
segment DNA
BAC libraries of G. indiensis and G. flavicoxis with a 120 kb
average insert size were constructed by Amplicon Express
(Pullman, WA, USA), using a partial BamHI digest inserted
into an MboI site of a pECBAC1 vector. A nylon filter arrayed
with 9,216 BAC clones was created from each library. In order
to identify BAC clones containing proviral segment DNA, BV
encapsidated viral DNA from each was radioactively labeled
with 32P-labeled α-dCTP (NEN/Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA,
USA) using the Redi-prime II DNA labeling kit (Amersham
Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Labeled DNA was then
purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA). The filter was pre-hybridized at 65°C for
at least 3 hours with Rapid-hyb Buffer (Amersham Biosciences) and 500 μg of salmon testes DNA (denatured at
100°C; Sigma-Aldritch, St. Louis, MO, USA). The probe was
added and allowed to hybridize overnight at 65°C. The filter
was then washed 2 times for 60 minutes each at 65°C with a
0.1 × SSC/0.1% SDS solution, wrapped in plastic wrap, and
autoradiographed using Kodac BioMax MS film.

version of physical gaps to sequence gaps using 'POMP'
(pipette optimal multiplex PCR) [52] and or/a 'Genome
Walker' kit (Invitrogen™).

Viral segment-specific PCRs and hybridizations
Primers were developed specific to individual identified GiBV
and GfBV viral segment sequences as described in [15]. PCR
was performed in a 10 μl solution that included 0.1 μl template DNA, 0.3 μl 50 mM MgCl2, 1 μl 10× PCR buffer, 0.2 μl
10 mM dNTPs, 7.9 μl H2O, 0.1 μl Platinum Taq (Invitrogen),
0.2 μl F primer (20 pm/μl), and 0.2 μl RC primer (20 pm/μl).
The PCR protocol was 94° for 2 minutes; 35 cycles of 94° for
30 s, 58° for 30 s, 72° for 45 s; followed by 72° for 7 minutes.
PCR products to be used for hybridizations were purified
using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Segmentspecific hybridizations were done as described above for total
viral DNA hybridizations.

Derivation of consensus segment sequences for GiBV
and GfBV
Because individual sequence reads could not be associated
with individual wasps, a conical consensus sequence was generated for each BV segment using the SliceTools package [53].
At a given position in a conical consensus, all bases with a
cumulative quality value within 50% of the highest cumulative quality value were assigned to that position.

Annotation
A combination of SoftBerry's FGENESH [54] using the honey
bee (A. mellifera) training set, and the Beijing Genome Institute's BGF [55] trained on the silkmoth (B. mori) were used
for gene prediction, in addition to the AAT package [56],
which allows spliced alignment of proteins to genomic DNA,
thereby revealing potential exon-intron boundaries. Gene
models from FGENESH were generally accepted except when
multiple other sources of information contradicted those
models. SignalP [57,58] and tRNAScan-SE [59] were used to
predict signal peptides and tRNAs, respectively. Transposable elements were annotated using ProteinRepeatMasker [41]
and CENSOR [42].

Viral and BAC clone sequencing

Motif analyses

Approximately 7.5 μg of BV encapsidated DNA was sheared
and DNA fragments in the size range 3.5-4.5 kbp purified
after separation by agarose gel electrophoresis. The fragments were blunt ended and, after addition of BstXI adaptors,
cloned into the BstXI site of pHOS2. Shotgun libraries were
similarly made for each BAC clone. Celera Assembler [50]
and TIGR Assembler [51] were used to assemble random
sequence data for BV and BAC clones. Gap closure was
assisted by a closure editor tool called Cloe that also permits
the manual inspection and editing of sequence data. A variety
of methods were used to close gaps, including re-sequencing
the ends of random clones, transposon assisted sequencing
(GPS, New England Biolabs™, Ipswitch, MA, USA) or 'microlibrary' construction of single or pooled templates, and con-

Excision motifs were generated by cutting out a sequence
extending 30 bp upstream and downstream from the GCT
excision site at the 5' and 3' boundaries of proviral segments
and at the GCT circularization site of viral segments for both
GiBV and GfBV. No additional alignment was conducted on
the sequences. All motifs were visualized using WebLogo
[60,61]. Proviral excision motifs were also generated with
these sequences using MEME [33], and the resulting motifs
were used to search BAC sequences for potential additional
proviral segments using MAST [34].

Comparative genomic analyses
Jaccard orthologous gene clusters between GiBV and GfBV
were calculated using Sybil [62]. Syntenic blocks were

defined as two or more adjacent orthologous gene clusters,
and the results were visualized using Sybil [62]. This information, in addition to conserved location (locus and position
within that locus) of proviral segments, was used to define
homologous segments between GiBV and GfBV.

silent and replacement substitutions. The number of silent
and replacement polymorphisms within the GiBV shotgun
sequence data for these genes with at least 3× coverage were
then calculated using previously described methods [15]. The
M-K test [36] was then utilized to test gene pairs for evidence
of positive or negative selection.

Phylogenetic and compositional analyses
For the phylogenetic analysis, GiBV and GfBV MFS transporter genes were searched against the GenBank non-redundant protein database using BLASTP. The top 18 hits from
unique organisms were downloaded from GenBank (N. vitripennis, [GenBank:XP_001607065; XP_001602960]; A.
mellifera, [GenBank:XP_001120868; XP_395522]; Tribolium castaneum, [GenBank:XP_973694; XP_973659], [GenBank:XP_966705; XP_966524]; Anopheles gambiae,
Aedes
egypti,
[Gen[GenBank:XP_311836];
Bank:XP_001649205]; Drosophila melanogaster, [GenBank:NP_611451; NP_524479; CAA73031; XP_001361445];
Drosophila pseudoobscura, [GenBank:XP_001358762];
Mus musculus, [GenBank:NP_035525; CAC36405]; and
Rattus norvegicus, [GenBank:NP_062103]). Additionally,
the single GfBV MFS transporter gene was searched against
B. mori expressed sequence tags in GenBank, and the single
strong hit (E = e-61; [Genbank:BJ985900]) was downloaded
from GenBank and translated. These sequences, in addition
to the eight MFS transporters predicted for GiBV and GfBV,
were aligned using ClustalW [63], and regions of ambiguous
alignment were removed using Seaview [64], resulting in an
alignment of 448 amino acids. The phylogenetic analysis was
conducted using MrBayes 3.1.2 [65,66], sampling every 1,000
generations for 1 × 107 generations. The first 50% of generations were discarded as burn-in, and posterior probabilities
were calculated from the remaining 501 sampled generations.
For the nucleotide composition analysis, relative trinucleotide frequencies [67] were calculated for all segment, intersegmental, and flanking sequences. A Euclidean distance
matrix was then constructed from those frequencies. The
sequences were then clustered using the neighbor-joining
algorithm in PAUP* [68] and the resulting tree was visualized
with Treeview [69].

Molecular evolution analyses
All proteins described here for each genome were divided into
two sets: those encoded by proviral segments and flanking
genes. For each set, BLASTP in WU-BLAST [70] was used to
search the GiBV (or Gi) proteins against the GfBV (or Gf) proteins and vice versa. Nucleotide sequences of reciprocal best
hit pairs that appeared in syntenic regions (in the same segment for proviral genes and in the same region for flanking
genes) were aligned using the cdna_fast_pair method in TCoffee [71], and pairs with ambiguous or frameshifted alignments were removed. The codeml program in PAML [72,73]
was used to calculate dN/dS (Ka/Ks) for the remaining gene
pair alignments. Pairs of proviral genes were further analyzed
by using codeml in PAML [72,73] to calculate the number of
