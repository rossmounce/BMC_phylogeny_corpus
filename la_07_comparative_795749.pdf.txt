Abstract
Background: The aim of this study was to analyze the genomic diversity of several Tropheryma
whipplei strains by microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization. Fifteen clinical isolates
originating from biopsy samples recovered from different countries were compared with the T.
whipplei Twist strain. For each isolate, the genes were defined as either present or absent/divergent
using the GACK analysis software. Genomic changes were then further characterized by PCR and
sequencing.
Results: The results revealed a limited genetic variation among the T. whipplei isolates, with at most
2.24% of the probes exhibiting differential hybridization against the Twist strain. The main variation
was found in genes encoding the WiSP membrane protein family. This work also demonstrated a
19.2 kb-pair deletion within the T. whipplei DIG15 strain. This deletion occurs in the same region
as the previously described large genomic rearrangement between Twist and TW08/27. Thus, this
can be considered as a major hot-spot for intra-specific T. whipplei differentiation. Analysis of this
deleted region confirmed the role of WND domains in generating T. whipplei diversity.
Conclusion: This work provides the first comprehensive genomic comparison of several T.
whipplei isolates. It reveals that clinical isolates originating from various geographic and biological
sources exhibit a high conservation rate, indicating that T. whipplei rarely interacts with exogenous
DNA. Remarkably, frequent inter-strain variations were dicovered that affected members of the
WiSP family.

Background
Tropheryma whipplei is a Gram positive bacterium responsible for Whipple's disease [1]. This chronic, multisystemic infection is mainly characterized by intestinal

malabsorption, but also involves other organs such as the
heart and central nervous system and is ultimately fatal
without appropriate treatment [2]. T. whipplei infection in
human beings is particularly interesting due to the wide

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:349

range of disease outcomes [3]. While it is known to be
associated with the environment [4,5], the natural reservoir of T. whipplei is still unknown.
In 2000, the first human isolate of this bacterium was successfully cultured in a fibroblast cell line [6]. This allowed
investigators to examine the phenotypic characteristics of
the bacterium, about which little had been known [1,7],
and made possible the sequencing of the 0.93 Mb genome
[8,9]. This major achievement has provided new perspectives on both the diagnosis and treatment of Whipple's
disease [10,11]. Among the first post-genomic applications was the successful design of a comprehensive culture
medium, based on computer modeling of metabolic networks, which allowed the axenic growth of the microorganism [12]. The use of the axenic culture medium for
diagnostic purposes has enabled isolation of several T.
whipplei strains from cerebrospinal fluid, blood, synovial
fluid, lymph node, cardiac valve, skeletal muscle, and
stool [3]. T. whipplei replication in the absence of eukaryotic cells has also facilitated the immunoproteomic analysis of this pathogen, which was conducted using sera
from patients [13]. Finally, the absence of eukaryotic
nucleic acids favored optimization of RNA extraction
[14], thus making microarray-based transcriptional studies possible [15,16].
The DNA microarrays allow for the identification of
changes in gene expression in response to specific stimuli
from the environment on a global scale. This technology
also provides a powerful tool to study genome variability
among strains. Thus, microarray-based comparative
genomic hybridization (CGH) was described as a good
alternative to whole genome sequencing [17], and has
been applied for several human pathogens [18]. Such an
approach was shown to be useful to assess genome plasticity and evolutionary trends including analysis of potential gene transfer events [19]. Moreover, CGH analysis was
found to be helpful in revealing gene polymorphisms
associated with distinct tissue tropisms or niche adaptation [20-22], in characterizing virulence factors [23-28]
and in providing putative vaccine candidate antigens
[23,29].
To date, two T. whipplei strains have been sequenced,
TW08/27 [9] and Twist [8]. These strains were isolated
from cerebrospinal fluid collected in Germany [9] and the
cardiac valve of a Canadian patient [6], respectively. A
comparative analysis of the two strains revealed a large
chromosomal inversion. This observation, associated
with a high nucleotide identity between both strains (>
99%), was considered to be an indication of a very active
genome rearrangement process [8]. Such genomic recombination was hypothesized to be mediated by the WND
protein-coding repeats within genes encoding the WiSP

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/349

membrane proteins and to be associated with changes in
the set of proteins exposed at the surface of the bacteria.
According to this perspective, recombination would constitute an adaptive response to the host defense or to environmental conditions.
Due to the variable pathological profiles which can result
from T. whipplei infection, we hypothesized that it could
be of interest to further define the genetic diversity of various strains. To obtain information on T. whipplei gene
content, we performed a comparative analysis of sixteen
clinical isolates by CGH using the whole T. whipplei Twist
strain cDNA microarray. Results were subsequently validated by PCR and sequencing.

Results
Accuracy of genomic DNA hybridization on T. whipplei
microarray
Screening for divergent or absent regions in T. whipplei
strains isolated in our laboratory was carried out using a
microarray chip containing PCR products from 804 genes
corresponding to 99.5% of the T. whipplei Twist genome
[15]. In the first step, the accuracy of the T. whipplei
genomic DNA hybridization assays was determined
through control experiments self-hybridizing Cy5-labeled
Twist with Cy3-labeled Twist. As expected, the corresponding GACK analysis, which allows coding sequence
(CDS) classification as either conserved or absent/divergent using a trinary output under stringent conditions
[30], showed that 100% of the CDSs were present. No
hybridization was observed against negative control
DNAs present on the microarrays. Accordingly, we concluded that both experimental and computational
processing were appropriate for analyzing our data.
Global analysis of conserved and divergent CDSs in the T.
whipplei genome
Given the estimated probability of CDS presence deduced
from the GACK analysis of the 45 hybridization profiles
obtained, it appeared that T. whipplei genomic sequences
were highly conserved across the 16 isolates tested (Table
1). These 45 hybridizations consisted of three repeats of
the hybridization of 15 distinct T. whipplei isolates vs. the
Twist strain. Comparative analysis showed that relative to
the Twist isolate, the percentage of conserved CDSs ranges
from 97.76% (strain Dig15) to 99.88% (strains Slow1B,
Neuro1, and DigNeuro14). The heat map visualization of
genomic variations showed that there were differences
spread across the entire genomes (Additional file 1). Only
34 genes from the Twist isolate were predicted to be
absent or highly divergent in at least one tested strain.
Reduced hybridization can result either from whole gene
deletion or from nucleotide sequence variation. In order
to clarify the nature of the observed deletion/divergence,
PCR were performed using specific primers located

upstream and downstream of the targeted CDSs. The electrophoresis migration profile obtained for TWT596 is
shown in Figure 1. Analysis of the 72 deletions/divergences showed a reduced PCR amplicon size consistent
with the gene deletion observed in the 27 cases (Table 2).
Sequencing of the PCR products with the same migration
profile as those obtained from the T. whipplei Twist strain
indicated that the lower hybridization resulted from a
sequence variation in 43/45 genes. Further analysis of
nucleotide changes resulted in the identification of one
silent mutation (TWT176 in Dig15 strain). The genes were
interrupted by STOP codons in 9 cases, and 3 of these
were related to TWT099, which encodes a protein of
unknown function. The observed sequence divergences
mainly induce amino acid changes. Interestingly, when a
gene exhibited variations in several strains, the amino acid
changes they trigger were found to be partly conserved
(Figure 2 and Additional file 2). In two cases of genes
encoding proteins of unknown function, TWT151 and
TWT722, the predicted deletion/divergence was not associated with nucleotide changes. These false-positive values
were not included in the dendrogram established from
the overall CGH assay including sequencing data. As
shown in Figure 3, Dig7, Dig9, Slow2, Endo5, Endo7,
Art1 and DigMus17 formed a group distinct from Neuro2,
DigADP11, Neuro1, DigNeuro18, Dig10, DigNeuro14,

Slow1B; and Twist. Dig15 appeared to be phylogenically
distinct from all other isolates.
Major genomic changes are related to genes encoding for
WiSP family proteins
The distribution of the 34 absent/divergent CDSs was analyzed according to their functional classification. Of these,
23 genes encoded hypothetical proteins. This corresponds
to 10% of unknown genes annotated in the T. whipplei
Twist genome. The functional category exhibiting the
most number of genes altered, including both deletions
and mutations, corresponds to membrane proteins. Thus,
4/15 proteins (26.7%) in the WiSP family were found to
be absent or divergent. While most of the genes (58.9%)
exhibited divergence in only 1 of the 16 examined strains,
more frequent changes were observed in the WiSP family
proteins (Table 2). TWT232 and TWT594 sequence variations were observed in 3 and 9 T. whipplei strains, respectively, while TWT596 was found to be absent in 6 strains
and divergent in another one. With the exception of
Slow1B, DigNeuro14 and Neuro2 strains, the WiSP proteins differed from Twist in all T. whipplei strains. Other
CDS variations shared by several T. whipplei strains encode
either hypothetical proteins (9 cases), membrane proteins
(1 case), or FtsE, a cell division ATP-binding protein

The amplicon size obtained using the primers TWT595F1

(which had nucleotide changes in the Dig7, DigADP11,
Art1, DigMusc17, and DigNeuro18 strains).
CGH analysis reveals a major deletion in T. whipplei
DIG15
A more detailed analysis was then performed on the
genomic region of T. whipplei DIG15 strain ranging from
TWT608 to TWT624. Several genes consecutively located
in this region were predicted to be absent/divergent in this

strain, and other genes were characterized as uncertain
(Table 3). PCR assays were thus designed to bridge each of
the putatively deleted regions. A 2,950 bp amplicon was
amplified using forward and reverse primers located on
TWT607 and TWT625, and further sequenced to determine the exact location of the deletion event (Additional
file 3). These data demonstrated that all 17 CDSs located
between TWT607 and TWT625 were absent in T. whipplei
DIG15. Half of these corresponded to proteins with
unknown functions (Table 3). Genes encoding previously
characterized proteins such as recA and ftsK were also
absent. The GC% value of this deleted region was 46.59%,
compared to 46.3% for the whole genome [8]. Interestingly, the boundaries of this deleted genomic region are
two genes that belong to the WiSP membrane protein
family, namely TWT608 and TWT624. The sizes of these
genes in the T. whipplei Twist strain are 1,044 and 2,070
nucleotides, respectively. Both genes share an N-terminal
WND domain that could trigger a recombination event.
From BLAST analysis, both genes were found to be 99%
identical over a 784 bp nucleotide fragment. In the DIG15
sequenced amplicon, the region without BLAST similarities to TWT607, TWT625 or their adjacent intergenic
spacer is only 563 nucleotides. This indicates that the
recombination event induced a deletion around 19 kb
within the WND domain-containing WiSP proteins. This
deletion was also observed by PCR in the primary isolate
stored after the first passage in the fibrosblast cell line (not
shown). This putative recombination event is shown in
Figure 4.

Discussion
One of the major results from the CGH analysis performed with a microarray composed of PCR products
amplified from the 0.93 Mb T. whipplei Twist genome
[15], is the remarkable preservation of the genomic content of the 16 T. whipplei isolates. As previously claimed
[31,32], one of the limitations of this technique is the failure to detect genes that were not spotted on the microarrays. However, the high genomic conservation rate
observed in this study is consistent with the fact that T.
whipplei gene family size is an ancestral feature. This suggests an evolutionary scenario where the isolates originating from diverse sources have all evolved from a common
ancestor.
The percentage of T. whipplei Twist probes exhibiting differential hybridization in other strains is in the same range
as those described for the Francisella tularensis [33],
Chlamydia trachomatis [22], Coxiella burnetii [28], and Rickettsia prowazekii species [24]. A common trait among these
pathogens and T. whipplei is a small genome size between
0.93–2.0 Mb, a marked AT nucleotide bias, and the loss of
several metabolic pathways, which explains their complex
nutritional requirements [8,34-37]. While F. tularensis can

replicate under axenic conditions in vitro, it is thought that
obligate host-dependent survival is required in its natural
life cycle [37]. The strictly intracellular niche of T. whipplei
is still under debate. However, the high level of similarity
between T. whipplei strains strongly suggests that these
microorganisms are mainly associated with host cells in
vivo. While free-living and facultative intracellular bacteria
might be constantly bombarded with foreign genes,

genetic exchange opportunities are limited for obligate
intracellular bacteria, which may result in few evolutionary events of gene transfer [38,39]. In contrast to what was
observed for T. whipplei and other host-associated pathogens, the CGH analysis performed on enteric bacteria
including Salmonella enterica [40], Campylobacter jejuni
[41], Helicobacter pylori [42], Shigella [27,31] or Enterococcus faecalis [43] evidenced 15 to 23% genetic variations.

Among the 34 lacking or divergent CDSs found in at least
one of the tested strains, 23 encode for proteins of
unknown function, which can be considered non-essential for bacterial survival and replication. This is mainly
the case for TWT041 and TWT099-encoded proteins,
which are deleted and interrupted, respectively, in several
T. whipplei strains. While strain-specific divergences were
shown for deoD (Dig7), ksgA (Dig15), and trpE (Dig15),
nucleotide changes in ftsE were observed in 31.25% of isolates. These modifications lead to amino acid changes in
4 isolates, the gene being interrupted in the fifth one.
Alignment of the whole ftsE Twist gene [8] with the TW08/
27 gene [9] showed 70% similarity, which is in disagreement with the 99% identity of both genomes at the nucleotide sequence level [8]. Recent evidence showed that FtsE
was absolutely required for the process of bacterial division in low osmotic strength conditions, because this protein ensures the stability of the septal ring assembly [44].
In contrast, this ABC transporter-type protein was
described as non-essential for bacteria grown under highosmolarity conditions, as shown by viable ftsE null
mutants [44,45]. Relationships between mutations within
the Aeromonas hydrophila ftsE gene and the filamentous
phenotype of the bacteria, which likely interferes with
opsonophagocytosis, were also observed [46]. These
authors hypothesized that the formation of large bacterial
aggregates that could not be ingested by phagocytic cells
could be used to evade the immune system. The relevance
of FtsE changes for each T. whipplei strains is questionable,
but it can be hypothesized that the protein plays a role in
adaptating to environmental change.
This CGH analysis showed that the WiSP proteins, heterogeneous surface proteins grouped into a family based on
several identifying features including WND repeats [9],
are highly divergent across the T. whipplei strains compared in this study. A high divergence rate of genes related
to surface structure proteins has been described for several
pathogens including Yersinia pestis [21], Campylobacter
jejuni [41], and Shigella [31]. The heterogeneity of the T.
whipplei WiSP proteins is consistent with observations
made in previous studies using a shotgun sequence
assembly of the T. whipplei strain TW08/27 [9]. Indeed,
these authors provided evidence for the existence of 44
loci located within the WiSP coding sequence TW570,
where variations that mainly resulted in single amino acid
changes were observed. PCR amplification and sequencing of the N-terminal region of this gene further revealed
variations when the same culture was collected at different
passages [9]. Comparing different isolates showed that
TWT594 and TWT596, which are partly homologous to
the TW570 gene of T. whipplei TW08/27 strain, either
exhibited several amino acid mutations or were lacking.
Amino acid changes were observed in the WiSP protein
encoded by TWT594 in 8 isolates, and a frame-shift muta-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/349

tion was found in another strain. Deletion of the gene
encoding the TWT596 WiSP protein was observed in 43%
of the strains analyzed. While 4.2% of the T. whipplei
CDSs appeared to have diverged in the Twist strain relative to the other 15 strains tested, this value increased to
26.7 % when genes that belong to the WiSP protein family
were considered. These data emphasize the diversity of
such membrane proteins across various strains. Altogether, these findings suggest that divergent evolution of
this select set of genes could be associated with development of bacteria which have similar genomic contents, in
different environments. WiSP proteins exhibit amino acid
hypervariation that could be responsible for various pathological features and immune system evasion.
There was a notable deletion of 17 CDSs corresponding to
19,052 kb in the T. whipplei DIG15 strain, ranging from
TWT608 to TWT624. PCR amplification carried out on the
primary isolate of DIG15 concluded that this evolutionary
event did not occur in vitro. As previously reported for the
chromosomal inversion seen in the T. whipplei Twist and
TW08/27 strains [8], this deletion event is associated with
flanking WiSP membrane protein family coding genes.
This fits well with the proposed role of the conserved Nterminal WND domain in these proteins, with respect to
promoting genome recombination [8]. The observed
deletion probably results from homologous recombination events across such conserved domains. A correlation
between the hypermutable regions of the F. tularensis
genome and the presence of repeated sequences has been
previously reported [33]. The majority of deleted genes in
the T. whipplei DIG15 strain encode proteins with
unknown function that can be considered as non-essential. DNA rearrangements are believed to contribute to the
fitness of a pathogen in specific environments. Thus, the
adaptation of bacterial pathogens from the Bartonella and
Rickettsia genera, to host-restricted vectors such as lice, was
associated with accelerated rates of genome degradation
[47]. Interestingly, both major genomic rearrangements,
such as the chromosomal inversion among Twist and
TW08/27 and the 19 kb deletion in DIG15, are located in
the same region which can be considered as the major
hot-spot for intra-strain differentiation in T. whipplei.

Conclusion
In summary, this work provides the first comprehensive
genomic comparison of several isolates of T. whipplei. It
reveals that clinical isolates originating from various geographic and biological sources exhibit a high conservation
rate, suggesting that T. whipplei rarely interacts with exogenous DNA. The frequent variations among members of
the WiSP membrane protein family is a remarkable trait.
The significance of these changes remains to be investigated.

Methods
T. whipplei isolates and preparation of genomic DNA
T. whipplei isolates (n = 16) used in this study are detailed
in Table 1. These strains correspond to the whole collection of T. whipplei isolates available in our laboratory
when the project was initiated. Of the available strains, 3/
16 were isolated from patients with endocarditis, which is
representative of Whipple's disease patients worldwide
[3]. None of the patients were related to each other or had
been in contact. All bacterial isolates used in this study
were grown under axenic conditions as previously
described [12]. Eighteen day-old bacterial cultures (300
ml) were collected by centrifugation 16,900 × g for 10 min
at 4°C. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 3 ml PBS
and stored at -20 C. DNA was extracted using the
QIAamp® DNA mini kit according to the manufacturer's
instructions (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France), and the DNA
concentration was determined by UV absorbance at 260
nm.
Genomic DNA labeling
In the microarray experiments described below, DNA
from the T. whipplei Twist strain was used as a reference,
whereas the DNA from other isolates was referred as test
DNA. DNA was labeled with Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP
(Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) for the test
and reference samples, respectively, using the BioPrime®
Array CGH Genomic Labeling System (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). For each hybridization, 1 µg of T.
whipplei Twist DNA and test DNA were primed with random octamers, and Cy3- or Cy5-labeled probes were generated under the extension and fluorescent nucleotide
incorporation activity of exo-Klenow polymerase. The levels of incorporation were quantified by absorbance measurement at 550 nm and 650 nm. Samples were processed
for hybridization on microarrays when the incorporation
levels were ≥ 50 pmol of fluorochromes per µg of DNA.
Microarray hybridization
This study used T. whipplei microarrays spotted with 804
DNA fragments amplified from the Twist strain by PCR
[15]. These 804 amplicons corresponded to 99.5% of
annotated CDSs from the T. whipplei Twist genome. These
microarrays also included DNA sequences from yeast
intergenic regions (Lucidea™ Universal Score Card™,
Amersham) that were used as negative controls. Following
a post-processing step, 7 µg of labeled DNA for each reference and test sample were pooled for hybridization onto
microarrays as previously described [15]. All experiments
were conducted in triplicate, yielding 12 independent
measurements for each condition (representing 4 technical and 3 biological replicates). After an 18-hour incubation at 42°C, the slides were washed, dried with
compressed nitrogen, and scanned with the ScanArray®
Express (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA, USA).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/349

Microarray data analysis
The signal intensity, local background for both fluorescence channels of each spot, and the preliminary exclusion of irrelevant values, as flagged, were determined from
TIF images using the QuantArray® Microarray Analysis
Software version 3.0.0.0 (Packard BioScience). Data filtering and normalization were then performed using the
Microsoft Excel software. Spots with background-corrected signal intensity (median) less than two-fold of the
background intensity (median) in both channels were
excluded from further analysis. The background-subtracted signals derived from the remaining spots were normalized by the global median method, and the
normalized log ratio of test/reference signal for each spot
was recorded. For each CDS and each comparative strain
analysis, the median value of 12 normalized log ratios of
the test/reference signal was used for GACK analysis [30].
Trinary output was then applied to determine if the CDS
was present, uncertain, absent, or divergent. When the
deduced estimated probability of presence (EPP) was
100%, genes were designated as present (assigned '+1').
Genes with 0% EPP were assigned into absent/divergent
category ('-1'). The lack of hybridization to a probe spot
can indeed result from the absence of the gene or it can be
due to divergence of the gene within a portion of the gene
including the probe. When the EPP values ranged between
0% and 100%, the presence or absence/divergence of the
gene remained uncertain. GACK calculates dynamic cutoff values and can generate improved identification of
absent/divergent genes independently of any normalization process that would be strongly influenced by differences between the reference strain and tested strains. In
our case, because the number of absent/divergent genes is
very small, the global median method of normalization is
reasonable.
PCR verification and sequence analysis
To validate the results predicted by CGH, all deletion/
divergence events were verified by PCR amplification and/
or subsequent sequencing. For every gene suspected to be
absent/divergent, one pair of primers was designed to
anneal to the upstream and downstream genes flanking
the target region. The reaction was performed with DNA
from each strain using the Expand High Fidelity PCR
(Roche, Penzberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All PCR products were examined using
1% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide.
When the size of the PCR amplicons was similar to that
obtained with T. whipplei Twist, the putative divergence in
nucleotide sequences was assessed through sequencing
(ABI PRISM® BigDye® Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing
Kit, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Obtained
sequences were compared to that of the T. whipplei Twist
strain by the CLUSTALW program [48]. All primers used
in this study are listed in Additional file 4.

Phylogenetic analysis
A numerical score was assigned to each CDS analyzed
based on the following criteria: +3 for present, -3 for
absent, and +1 for containing nucleotide variation. A dendrogram was constructed using hierarchical clustering
