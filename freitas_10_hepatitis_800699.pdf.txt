Abstract
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global public health problem. Long-distance truck drivers live apart from their
family for long periods of time, a lifestyle that favors at-risk behaviors such as unprotected sex with multiple partners and illicit drug use. As data concerning HCV infection in this population are still rare, this paper aims to investigate the prevalence, genotypes/subtypes, and the factors associated with HCV infection in long-distance truck
drivers in Brazil. A cross-sectional survey was carried out with 641 Brazilian long-truck drivers who were recruited at
a major truck stop located at kilometer 1,296 of the BR-153 highway, which is considered to be one of the longest
roads in Brazil. All individuals were interviewed, and their serum samples were tested for the presence of antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) by ELISA and immunoblot. Anti-HCV positive samples were tested for HCV RNA by PCR
amplification of the 5′ NC and NS5B regions and were genotyped using the LiPA assay and nucleotide sequencing,
respectively. Factors associated with HCV infection were identified with logistic regression. The prevalence of HCV
infection was 1.4% (95% CI: 0.7-2.8). History of blood transfusion, sharing of personal hygiene tools, illicit drug use
and HBV status were factors independently associated with HCV infection in the study population. HCV RNA was
detected in 8/9 anti-HCV positive samples, in which genotypes 1 (n = 3), 2 (n = 2), and 3 (n = 3) were determined
by LiPA. Using phylogenetic tree analysis of the NS5B region, subtypes 1a (n = 1), 1b (n = 2), 2b (n = 2) and 3a
(n = 3) were identified. These data show that the prevalence of HCV infection among Brazilian truck drivers was
similar to that observed for the general population. History of blood transfusion, sharing of personal hygiene tools,
illicit drug use and HBV status were predictors of HCV infection. The HCV genotypes/subtypes identified in the
study population are consistent with those circulating in Brazil.
Findings
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global public
health problem. Approximately 130-170 million individuals are thought to be infected worldwide [1]. On average, 80% of acutely infected individuals develop a
chronic infection. The principal long-term complications
of chronic hepatitis C are cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma [2]. HCV is characterized by a high degree of
genetic heterogeneity. Phylogenetic analysis of fulllength or partial sequences of HCV isolates has led to
the identification of six genotypes (1 to 6), each comprising multiple subtypes (designated a, b, c, etc) [3].
These genotypes and subtypes have distinct geographical
distributions, and information on their distribution is

needed to perform effective molecular and epidemiological HCV surveillance [4,5].
Long-distance truck drivers live apart from their
family for long periods of time, a lifestyle that favors atrisk behaviors such as unprotected sex with multiple
partners, including commercial sex workers, and illicit
drug use, which have been demonstrated to be predictors of HCV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections [6-9]. In spite
of these risk factors, there have been few investigations
on HCV infection in this population [9-12]. In a previous study, an overall HBV infection prevalence of
18.9% was found among long-distance truck drivers in
Brazil. Length of profession longer than 20 years, time
away from home lasting more than 15 days and a history of sexual transmitted infections (STIs) were associated with HBV infection [13]. However, no data are
available on HCV infection in this highly mobile

population in Brazil and more generally in Latin America. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence, genotypes/subtypes, and the factors
associated with HCV infection in long-distance truck
drivers in Brazil.
A cross-sectional study was carried out in a population of long-distance truck drivers in Brazil that had
been previously examined for HBV epidemiological status [13]. From October 2005 to October 2006, truck drivers were recruited once per month (on a Saturday or a
Monday, during the morning or afternoon) at a major
truck stop located at kilometer 1,296 of the BR-153
highway in Goiânia City, Central Brazil. This highway is
considered to be one of the longest roads in Brazil
(3,566.3 km), spanning the country from south to north
(Figure 1). A total of 771 long-distance truck drivers
from different regions of Brazil who stopped to refuel,
eat and rest at this stop were invited to take part in the
study. Of these, 641 agreed to participate, and informed
consent was obtained from all. There was no statistical
difference based on socio-demographic characteristics
between the participants and those who were unwilling
to participate (data not shown). The protocol used in
the present study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Materno Infantil Hospital in Goiânia city,
Goiás state. The participants were interviewed to collect
socio-demographic data and possible risk factors for
HCV infection. Blood samples were collected from all
participants, and sera were stored at -20°C.
All serum samples were tested using an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the presence of antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) (Hepanostika Ultra, Biomedical, Shanghai, China). Anti-HCV-positive samples

were retested by an immunoblot (Bioblot HCV, Biokit,
Barcelona, Spain) and submitted to RNA detection by a
nested PCR with primers complementary to the conserved area of the 5′ NC region of HCV [14]. A line
probe assay (Inno-LiPA HCV II, Innogenetics, Ghent,
Belgium) was used to determine the genotype of the isolates using amplicons of the 5′ NC region. Nucleotide
sequence analysis was performed after a semi-nested
PCR amplification of the NS5B region [15].
Prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI)
were calculated. Fisher’s exact test was used to evaluate
association between variables and HCV infection
(defined as positive for anti-HCV). These, estimated by
the odds ratio in univariate analysis, were further analyzed with a stepwise logistic regression model. Statistical significance was assessed at the 0.05 probability level
in all analyses. Statistical evaluations were performed
using SPSS, version 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, US, 1999).
The study group of 641 Brazilian long-distance truck
drivers was composed mainly of males (99.2%). The
mean age was 40.6 ± 10.1 years. The majority of the
participants were white (69.9%), married (77%), had
received eight years or less of formal education (fundamental education in Brazil) (68.8%) and were truck drivers for more than 10 years (62.6%). More than half of
the group (51.9%) reported a monthly income of US$
750 or less. Ten truck drivers were found to be antiHCV positive by ELISA. Of these, nine were subsequently confirmed as positive by immunoblot, resulting
in an anti-HCV prevalence of 1.4% (95% CI: 0.7-2.8).
Table 1 presents the univariate and multivariate analyses of the factors associated with HCV infection in
long-distance truck drivers in Brazil. In the univariate
analysis, sharing of personal hygiene tools, illicit drug
use and HBV status were predictors of HCV infection
and history of blood transfusion showed an association
with a borderline P value. These factors were independent associated with HCV infection in a multivariate
analysis.
Among the anti-HCV-positive samples, eight were
HCV RNA positive. The LiPA assay for the 5′ NC
region was able to determine the following genotypes: 1
(n = 3), 2 (n = 2), and 3 (n = 3). For subtyping analysis,
all eight HCV RNA-positive samples could be amplified
and sequenced in the NS5B region. Using phylogenetic
tree analysis of the NS5B region (Figure 2), subtypes 1a
(n = 1), 1b (n = 2), 2b (n = 2) and 3a (n = 3) were
identified.
The present study represents the first report on the
epidemiology of HCV infection in long-distance truck
drivers in Brazil. The prevalence of HCV infection
found was similar to that observed for the general population (1.42%-1.5%) [16,17]. Regarding data for truck drivers in other countries, the prevalence determined in

this study was within the confidence interval range
reported for Bangladesh (0.8%; 95% CI: 0.2-2.4), India
(3.0%; 95% CI: 0.8-9.2), and Eritrea (6.0%; 95% CI: 1.517.5) [10-12], but it was lower than that observed in
New Mexico, USA (8.5%; 95% CI: 6.5-11.0) [9].
Illicit drug use was the main predictor of HCV infection in the study population. Among the 81 truck drivers who reported illicit drug use, the majority had used
non-injecting drugs, including the anti-HCV-positive
individuals. The risk of HCV infection associated with
non-injecting drugs is probably linked to the usual practice of sharing of non-injecting drug implements, such
as pipes and straws, for smoking and sniffing/snorting
drugs, which could lead to blood-to-blood contact [18].
Additionally, one-third of truck drivers in the current
study reported regular use of amphetamines (“rebite”, an
oral stimulant), and most drivers also reported ongoing
alcohol consumption. These habits are frequent among
Brazilian truck drivers and appear to influence unsafe
sex practices [6-8].
In fact, risk behaviors such as unprotected sex with
multiple partners, including commercial sex workers,
and history of STIs were frequent among the truck drivers investigated but were not associated with HCV
infection. These data are consistent with findings
obtained among truck drivers in New Mexico, USA [9].
Other variables related to percutaneous exposure to
blood such as history of blood transfusion, sharing of
personal hygiene tools, and HBV status were independent associated with HCV infection in the study population. Regarding blood transfusion, HCV infection was
associated with this procedure before the introduction
of screening for anti-HCV antibodies in Brazilian blood
banks [4]. In fact, the anti-HCV-positive truck drivers
reported having undergone blood transfusions with
blood that had not been screened for anti-HCV antibodies (before November 1993). Similarly, but in lower
level, the sharing of personal hygiene tools has also
shown an association with HCV infection [19,20], as
well as HBV status [9].
Among the nine anti-HCV-positive truck drivers, all
but one were also HCV RNA positive, highlighting their
potential to transmit HCV. Further, these individuals
were infected with HCV genotypes 1, 2 and 3. These
genotypes were also detected in other populations in
Brazil, such as blood donors and chronically infected
patients. The HCV subtypes identified in the study
population (1a, 1b, 2b and 3a) are also consistent with
the subtypes circulating in Brazil [15,21-23].
These results must be considered in the context of the
study’s limitations. The study population does not represent all long-distance truck drivers in Brazil but only
those recruited at a large truck stop along the BR-153
highway in Central Brazil. Nonetheless, this is one of

Page 5 of 6

the longest and most important roads in Brazil, spanning the country from south to north, where longdistance truck drivers represent a highly mobile population. Moreover, given that there is a lack of available
data on the serological and molecular epidemiology of
HCV infection among long-distance truck drivers in
Latin America, these data provide valuable insight into
this topic.
In summary, the prevalence of HCV infection was
similar to that observed for the general population. History of blood transfusion, sharing of personal hygiene
tools, illicit drug use and HBV status were predictors of
HCV infection. The HCV genotypes/subtypes identified
in the study population are consistent with those circulating in Brazil.
