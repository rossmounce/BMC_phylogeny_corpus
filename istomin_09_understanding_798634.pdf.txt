Abstract
Background: The human innate immune system uses a system of extracellular Toll-like receptors
(TLRs) and intracellular Nod-like receptors (NLRs) to match the appropriate level of immune
response to the level of threat from the current environment. Almost all NLRs and TLRs have a
domain consisting of multiple leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), which is believed to be involved in ligand
binding. LRRs, found also in thousands of other proteins, form a well-defined "horseshoe"-shaped
structural scaffold that can be used for a variety of functions, from binding specific ligands to
performing a general structural role. The specific functional roles of LRR domains in NLRs and
TLRs are thus defined by their detailed surface features. While experimental crystal structures of
four human TLRs have been solved, no structure data are available for NLRs.
Results: We report a quantitative, comparative analysis of the surface features of LRR domains in
human NLRs and TLRs, using predicted three-dimensional structures for NLRs. Specifically, we
calculated amino acid hydrophobicity, charge, and glycosylation distributions within LRR domain
surfaces and assessed their similarity by clustering. Despite differences in structural and genomic
organization, comparison of LRR surface features in NLRs and TLRs allowed us to hypothesize
about their possible functional similarities. We find agreement between predicted surface
similarities and similar functional roles in NLRs and TLRs with known agonists, and suggest possible
binding partners for uncharacterized NLRs.
Conclusion: Despite its low resolution, our approach permits comparison of molecular surface
features in the absence of crystal structure data. Our results illustrate diversity of surface features
of innate immunity receptors and provide hints for function of NLRs whose specific role in innate
immunity is yet unknown.

Background
The innate immune system provides a first level of defense
against invading agents such as microbial pathogens and
toxins and plays a role in maintaining a stable, healthy
composition of the commensal microbiome. In mammals, the important role of continuously surveying the

environment is played by members of two protein families: extracellular Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and intracellular Nod-like receptors (NLRs), also referred to as
nucleotide-binding domain- and leucine-rich repeat-containing proteins. (In this manuscript we use NLR nomenclature as recommended by HUGO [1] as well as

alternative names, such as NOD and NALP, which are
more prevalent in current literature.) While individual
receptors from both families have distinct specific roles,
the overall function of the innate immune system requires
their complex, synergistic interaction. (For recent reviews,
see [2-4].)
Both TLR and NLR families belong to the oldest branch of
the immune system, the innate immunity, and have complex evolutionary history that started in the simplest multicellular organisms and went through significant
expansions and contractions in various lineages leading to
present day vertebrates and mammals [5,6]. For instance,
TLR and NLR families in some invertebrates, such as
amphioxus, have over 80 members. In early branching
vertebrates, such as sea lamprey and hagfish, a closely
related family of variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs)
provide a version of adaptive immunity, which was lost in
higher vertebrates [7].
In humans, the TLR family consists of ten proteins, which
have been a subject of intense experimental studies during
the past decade due to their critical role in immunity and
involvement in diseases such as Crohn's disease [8], cystic
fibrosis lung disease [9], inflammatory bowel disease
[10], familial Mediterranean fever [11], septic joint disease [12], and several others. TLRs sense the presence of
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by specific binding sites in their extracellular "horseshoe"shaped receptor domains consisting of multiple leucinerich repeat (LRR) motifs. Binding-induced conformational change and/or dimerization provides a signal to the
intracellular Toll/interleukin receptor (TIR) domain,
which in turn binds specific adaptor molecules, such as
Myd88, leading eventually to NF-κB transcription factor
activation and transcription of proinflammatory cytokine
genes [13]. From numerous experimental studies it is
known that the LRR domains of different TLRs specifically
interact with a rather diverse plethora of ligands, from
bacterial flagellin and ss/dsRNA to peptidoglycans to imidazoquinioline compounds. By integrating these signals,
the TLR receptors sense the microbial state of the immediate environment and define the appropriate level of
innate immunity activity.
The NLR family receptors provide complementary, but
less-studied and -understood, mechanisms of intracellular
PAMP detection and innate immunity regulation. Twentytwo genes coding for NLR proteins are found in the
human genome, typically consisting of a C-terminal LRR
domain (homologous to the ligand-binding domain of
TLRs), the nucleotide-binding oligomerization (NACHT)
domain, and the N-terminal effector domain. Several different effector domains can be found in human NLRs,
including the caspase recruitment (CARD) domain (in
NOD1-4, IPAF, and CIITA); the pyrin/PAAD (PYD/PAAD)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/10/48

domain (in NALP1-14); the baculovirus "inhibitor of
apoptosis" (BIR) domain (in NAIP); and an uncharacterized domain (in NLRX1), thereby partitioning NLRs into
at least four subgroups. The variety of effector domains in
other organisms, specifically invertebrates, is much larger
[6]. Following binding of a ligand to the LRR domain,
NALP1, NALP3, and IPAF are known to form multimer
complexes termed "inflammasomes." Inflammasome formation leads to a further sequence of molecular events:
activation of caspases and conversion of pro-interleukins
into their active form. Recently, inflammasomes were
shown [14] to be structurally similar to apoptosomes
[15], highlighting the evolutionarily conserved mechanism of activated oligomerization, carried our by nucleotide binding AAA [16] proteins belonging to two distinct
families: the NACHT family (PFAM PF05729, present in
the NLR family) and NBARC family (PFAM PF00931,
present in APAF family of apoptosis regulators).
After almost a decade since their discovery, information
on ligand specificities of the NLR family proteins remains
elusive. NOD1 and NOD2 are known to sense bacterial
cell wall-derived peptidoglycans γ-D-glutamyl-mesodiaminopimelic acid (iE-DAP) [17] and muramyl dipeptide (MDP) [18,19], respectively. The NALP1 inflammasome was shown to be activated by MDP in a two-step
manner [14]. The NALP3 inflammasome is activated by a
wide range of ligands: bacterial RNA, uric crystals, antiviral imidazoquinioline compounds R837 and R848, and
contact sensitizers (CSs) such as trinitro-chlorobenzene.
NALP3 mutations are known to correlate with a number
of autoinflammatory disorders, e.g., Muckle-Wells syndrome [20,21], and mutations in NOD2 gene are linked
to increased susceptibility to the chronic inflammatory
disorders such as Crohn's disease (CD), psoriatic arthritis,
and Blau syndrome [22]. IPAF is known to sense bacterial
flagellin [23,24], although whether flagellin is the direct
and the only IPAF ligand is under debate [25]. Finally,
CIITA that serves as a master regulator of major histocompatibility complex genes transcription is known to bind
many DNA-binding and co-activator proteins. Its LRR
domain was found to be involved in CIITA self-association [26] as well as in binding a novel zinc-finger protein
ZXDC [27]. The specific roles of other NLRs in innate
immunity (and/or in apoptosis) are at this point
unknown. At the same time, there is no direct structure
information on LRR domains of any of the NLRs. Given
the importance of understanding NLRs' function and the
lack of information on their structure and agonists, we
believed a theoretical study might provide some useful
insights and help design experimental efforts.
The main subjects of this work, the ligand-binding
domains of NLRs and TLRs, both consist of multiple leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs. LRRs are extensively used by
nature as building blocks for assembling scaffolds of proPage 2 of 15

tein interfaces, designed primarily for specific proteinprotein interactions. About 500 LRR-containing proteins
with diverse (and often unknown) functions have been
identified in the human genome. Due to the importance
of LRR proteins, they have been a subject of intensive
experimental work, with the first crystal structure of a
ribonuclease inhibitor [28,29] providing a major advance
in the field. These advances continue today, with over 170
structures of LRR-containing proteins, including three TLR
structures, solved through 2008. Much has been learned
about structural principles of LRR proteins organization
from theoretical and modeling perspectives [30-33].
Lastly, it is interesting to note that while LRR domains of
TLR and NLR proteins are homologous, they belong to
distinct sub-branches of the LRR family, and both have
close homologs that are not innate immunity receptors.
For instance, the families of LRR- and immunoglobulincontaining proteins, involved in cell-cell adhesion, are
closer related to TLRs than NLRs are, and on the other
hand, ribonuclease inhibitor, a protein not involved in
innate immunity, is closely related to NLRs but is much
more distant from TLRs. These observations suggest that
NLR, TLR, and VLR families have a very complex evolutionary history with multiple duplication, domain swapping, and domain recruitment events.
While it is generally believed that LRR domains of most
NLRs and TLRs are involved in direct binding of agonist
molecules, for NLRs there is little experimental proof of
this. Some evidence of direct agonist binding by NALP1
LRRs is given in [14]. When referring to "LRR ligands" in
this manuscript, we recognize that binding to LRR
domains is an assumption at this point, and that "ligands"
can be either the "danger signals" themselves, or the possible intermediate molecules [34].
Since the overall shape of LRR domains from different
proteins is relatively conserved, the functional similarities
and differences between them must be defined by specific
features of their surfaces. This would be true regardless of
whether LRR domains interact with immunity "danger
signals" directly or by means of intermediate molecules
(e.g. similarly to TLR4 binding LPS-loaded MD2, or CIITA
interacting with numerous transcription activator proteins), or the functionality is conferred by LRR interactions with other (e.g. NACHT or PYR) domains of NLRs.
The key point is that if LRR surface properties within a
given NLR/TLR pair are similar, they are likely to bind the
broadly similar type of molecules.
In this manuscript, we investigate surface features of the
twenty-two human NLRs, and by comparing them to
those of TLRs, attempt to predict likely similarities
between their functions. First, we have built homology
models for LRR domains of twenty NLRs. Second, we have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/10/48

investigated distributions of amino acid charge and
hydrophobicity across LRR domain surfaces and by means
of clustering analysis have quantitatively assessed their
similarities. Additionally, we have analyzed distributions
of consensus N-linked glycosylation sites within TLRs, in
order to support application of our approach to (presumably non-glycosylated) NLRs. While the simplicity of our
analyses requires care when interpreting the results, we
believe they may be helpful in designing future experiments to shed light on the role of NLR-coding genes in
human innate immunity.

Methods
Phylogenetic analyses
Multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees (see Figure 1)
were built using ClustalX2 [35]. The most divergent
sequence, NAIP, was used as an outgroup to root the tree.
The tree reliability assessment was conducted by means of
the bootstrap method using 1,000 tree samples. Several
other multiple alignment and tree building strategies produced essentially identical results (data not shown). Protein sequences and gene organization information were
obtained from the Ensembl database [36].
Homology modeling
In order to visualize structures and surface features of LRR
domains from human NLRs (see Figure 2), homology
models were built based on pairwise alignments of NLR
amino acid sequences with the sequence of porcine ribonuclease inhibitor (RI), whose X-ray structure (PDB id:
2BNH) was used as a template. The two proteins for
which the models were not built are NOD4 and NALP10.
NOD4 LRR domain consists of 43 LRRs, and all LRR-containing proteins with available structures are too small to
be used as a template. The second protein, NALP10, lacks
an LRR domain.

Amino-acid sequence alignments were manually refined
using the Swiss-Pdb Viewer [37] to account for additional
information obtained from the gene structure and from
structural comparisons between LRR proteins (see below).
Because of the high sequence similarity between the template and the prediction targets (50-60%), homology
modeling was performed by means of the SWISS-MODEL
server [38].
Electrostatics and hydrophobicity calculations were carried out for NLR homology models as well as for experimental crystal structures of two TLRs. They were
conducted utilizing MOE software (Chemical Computing
Group).

tal structure data, we mapped physicochemical features of
residues on the surface using existing knowledge about
LRR sequence-to structure-mapping [31-33].
The typical LRR sequence contains a conserved motif LxxLxLxxNxL, where L is leucine, isoleucine, valine, or phenylalanine, and N is asparagine, threonine, serine, or
cysteine. In NLRs there is a striking correlation between
their gene organization and amino acid sequence. Specifically, in NALPs, two consecutive LRR motifs
XLaaNaLaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaLaaLXLaaNaLaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaIaaL of length 28 + 29 = 57 residues
are encoded by a single exon [3], while we have found that
in NODs each LRR motif XLaaNaLaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaLaaL of length 28 residues is encoded by a single exon.
This unusual genomic structure has interesting structural
consequences, which would be a subject of a separate
publication [39]. These two facts have allowed us to make
reliable predictions for positions and boundaries of LRR
motifs in human NLR sequences. In TLRs such an unusual
structure-exon correlation is lacking, and the whole LRR
domain is typically encoded by one large exon.
Finally, from the available structures of other LRR-containing proteins it is known that the aaLXLaa pattern corresponds to a beta-strand in the inner concave surface,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/10/48

which is then followed by a C-terminal side loop, by an
alpha-helix on the outside convex surface, and by the Nterminal side loop. This property is very well conserved in
numerous LRR-containing proteins, and we have utilized
it to improve mapping between LRR sequence and structure. The residue X in the aaLXLaa motif was used as reference residue to define positions of all other residues on
the LRR surface (Figure 3A). The next 5 residues are
located on the C-terminal side (usually loop conformation), the next 12 residues are located in the outer convex
part (usually alpha-helical or loop conformation), and
finally the next 5 residues represent the N-terminal side
(usually loop conformation). In TLRs, the typical length
of the outer part is 9 residues, but there is much variation.
After we performed the sequence-to-structure mapping as
described above, we were able to partition the surface into
four parts and analyze distributions of amino acid properties such as charge and hydrophobicity within these parts
separately. Distribution of potential glycosylation sites
was also examined for extracellular TLRs.

surfaces shown in Figure 3B. The amino acid charge was
calculated assuming the pH of 7.0, and the hydrophobicity was quantified by hydropathy index ranging from -4.5
to +4.5 [40] with negative (positive) values corresponding
to hydrophilic (hydrophobic) properties.
Within a given protein, for each LRR motif i, we calculated
average charge (qi) and hydropathy (hi) separately for each
of the four surface regions. For an LRR domain with n
motifs, this produced 4 n values for charge and the same
for hydropathy. Next, in order to characterize the distribution of these values within each surface, we have calculated the first four moments, mk, (k = 0...3) of qi and hi
distributions:

With these definitions, the moment m0 is simply the average value, and the moment m2 is related to the square of
the standard deviation. The moments m1 and m3 reflect
additional details of the distributions, in particular the
directional trends (N-terminus being more/less hydrophobic or charged that the C-terminus).
The distributions of charge and hydropathy within one
protein are thus each characterized by a sequence of 4 surface × moments = 16 values. In order to quantify similarities of distributions within different proteins, we used
Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient, rS (it is similar to the usual Pearson's correlation coefficient, but
reduces the effect of outliers). The similarity between distributions was then defined as (1 - rS). Clustering analysis
was then performed by a complete linkage method utilizing Java Treeview software [41].
Glycosylation distribution analysis
Consensus N-linked glycosylation sites were predicted by
searching for patterns NxxS and NxxT in TLR sequences. In
globular proteins, such predictions greatly overestimate
the number of glycosylation sites, assuming that all sites
matching the pattern above are accessible to oligosaccharyltransferases in order for glycosylation to occur, while in
reality most of these sites are buried inside protein structure. In our case, however, such predictions can be much
more accurate because we could predict which of the
potential glycosylation sites were exposed to solvent.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis of NLR and TLR leucine-rich repeat
domain sequences
As a first step, we have performed a phylogenetic analysis
of LRR domains in NLRs and TLRs. Extreme sequence
length diversity among LRRs from these families makes
conducting such an analysis in a meaningful way nontrivial. This is further complicated by the fact that full length
multiple alignment of complete sequences contains
numerous large gap regions, which makes its truncation
difficult. To circumvent the latter problem, we built a multiple alignment using a 10-fold increased gap extension
penalty and truncated it from N- and C-terminal ends to
make its length similar to that of the shortest sequence
(see Additional File 1). The resulting alignment was then
used to build a rooted phylogenetic tree (see Figure 1 and
Methods). Among the NLR and TLR sequences, we also
included a sequence of human ribonuclease inhibitor (RI)
consisting of a highly-regular LRR domain closely homologous to that of LRRs in the NRL family.

The sequences group into three distinct clusters: (i) NALPs
and RI; (ii) CARD-containing proteins and NLRX1; and
(iii) TLRs. (Similar clustering was found when the multiple alignment was built using a default gap extension penalty and was used without truncation to infer a tree; data
not shown.) Surprisingly, the sequence similarity-based
phylogeny of the C-terminal LRR domain well agrees with
the classification of all these proteins based on the N-terminal effector domain. Within NALPs, there are three distinct subgroups: (a) NALP2, NALP5, NALP7, NALP8,
NALP14; (b) NALP4, NALP9, NALP11, NALP13; (c)
NALP3, NALP12, and RI. It is interesting to note that IPAF
and CIITA, as well as NLRX1 whose effector domain lacks
definitive classification, group together with CARD-containing NODs. This suggests that NLRX1 effector domain
might be CARD-like. This analysis supports known phylogenetic relationships between NLR and TLR families, but
it does not permit us to draw any conclusions regarding
similarities of surface features between TLRs with known
ligands and NLRs.
Homology models of LRR domains and sequence-tostructure mapping
In Figure 2 we present homology models for LRR domains
of twenty NLRs (except NOD4 and NALP10) along with
experimentally determined structures of two TLRs. The
first observation is that there is much diversity in the LRR
domain size - from 7 LRRs (in CIITA) to 19 LRRs (in
NALP5). An unusually large number of LRRs (43 LRRs) is
found in NOD4, whose model was not built because there
is no large enough template structure available (see Discussion). Second, coloring of the models according to surface electrostatic potential and hydrophobicity reveals
significant diversity of their surface features.

The models in Figure 2 are helpful in visualizing LRR
domain structures and could be used for explicit proteinligand docking; however they are not suitable for quantitative assessment of surface similarity. In order to quantitatively analyze the similarity of surface features of LRR
domains, we resorted to their reduced-resolution representation. First, we adopted a simple approach to implicitly
infer LRR domain three-dimensional structures from their
amino acid sequences (see Figure 3A and Methods). Second, we have partitioned the total surface of the LRR
domain of each protein into four regions (see Figure 3B
and Methods): concave inner surface (mainly betastrands), N-terminal side, C-terminal side, and convex
outer surface (mainly alpha-helices in NLRs and RI, and
loops or beta strands in TLRs). Before conducting a quantitative comparison of NLR and TLR surface features we
had to consider possible perturbations to TLR surface
properties due to glycosylation.
Role of glycosylation of LRR domain surfaces
It is well known that LRR domains in all ten human TLRs
are N-glycosylated due to their extracellular localization,
and in some of them glycosylation is essential for proper
function [42,43]. This is not surprising as glycosylation
can dramatically alter surface properties and thereby affect
ligand binding. Since NLRs are all known to be cytosolic
proteins their N-linked glycosylation is unlikely, which
complicates a direct comparison of their surface features
to those of TLRs. To understand the potential role of TLR
glycosylation in their ligand binding, we have performed
a search for consensus N-linked glycosylation sites within
TLR sequences, and analyzed their distribution over the
domain surfaces. The results are summarized in Table 1.

The TLRs that contain many consensus glycosylation sites
are TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9. In TLR3, all surfaces
except the C-terminal side that is known to bind dsRNA
contain several glycosylation sites. In TLR7, inner and
outer surfaces are likely to be glycosylated while side ones
are not, which is consistent with binding of ssRNA via one
of its side surfaces. Glycosylation of TLR8 and TLR9
resembles that of TLR3 in that only the C-terminal side
surface is glycan-free. In the rest of the TLRs, each of the
four surfaces contains no more then three potential glycosylation sites. As an additional step, we have also analyzed
NLR sequences for potential glycosylation (data not
shown), and found that they contain 0-2 consensus glycosylation sites per surface, with the only exception being
an N-terminal surface of NOD3, which interestingly contains 10 such sites.
These findings indicate that while glycosylation of some
TLRs certainly modulates their surface properties, in most
cases the ligand binding sites are located in non-glycosylated regions and, in addition, the overall surface area

affected by glycosylation is relatively small, so that global
surface comparisons such as those performed here are not
affected.
Hydrophobicity and charge distributions: clustering
analysis within full LRR surfaces
The two physico-chemical amino acid properties that critically affect ligand binding and whose distributions we
have thus analyzed are charge and hydrophobicity. Figure
4 shows an example of our clustering analyses of hydropathy distribution moments within each of the four
domain surfaces. The similarity measure in this analysis is
Spearman's correlation (see Methods). Based on clustering results, LRR domain pairs that have particularly similar hydropathy distributions and LRR numbers are: TLR5
and IPAF (both respond to bacterial flagellin, although for
IPAF this is under debate [25]); NOD2 (ligand: MDP) and
NALP8 (ligand unknown); RI (ligand RNase) and NALP7
(ligand unknown); TLR6 (ligand: diacyl lipopeptide) and
NAIP (ligand unknown); NALP4 (ligand unknown) and
NALP14 (ligand unknown); TLR1 (ligand: triacyl lipopeptide) and TLR10 (ligand unknown); TLR3 (ligand:
dsRNA) and NALP6 (ligand unknown).

Figure 5 presents results of a similar clustering analysis of
charge distributions. The domain groups with similar
hydrophobicity distributions are: RI (ligand: RNase) and
NALP9 (ligand unknown); NALP3 (ligands: RNA, small
molecules) and NALP2 (ligand unknown); TLR8 (ligands:
ssRNA, imidazoquiniolines) and NAIP; TLR3 (ligand:
dsRNA), TLR7 (ligands: ssRNA, small molecules), and
NALP6 (only 8 LRRs; ligand unknown).
Hydrophobicity and charge distributions within individual
LRR domain surfaces
In order to gain further insight into similarities of LRR surface features between NLRs and TLRs, we conducted a
careful manual inspection of similarity patterns across

Hierarchical clustering analysis of amino acid hydropathy distributions within LRR domains of NLRs and TLRs
Hierarchical clustering analysis of amino acid hydropathy distributions within LRR domains of NLRs and TLRs.
Color matrix shows values for first four moments (m0,..., m3; cf. Equation 1) of the hydropathy distribution over four LRR
domain surfaces: inner (concave), N-terminal side, C-terminal side, and outer (convex). Red coloring corresponds to positive
values of the moments, black to zero, and green to negative values. The measure of similarity between sequences of moment
values of LRR surfaces is the Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient, rS. The tree on the left is the result of hierarchical
clustering of pairwise distances by the complete linkage method. Length of edges is proportional to distances, dS, between
sequences of moment values and is defined as dS = 1 - rS. Grouping of LRR domains into clusters indicates overall similarity of
their hydrophobicity distributions.

individual biologically relevant surfaces, also taking into
account results of our TLR glycosylation analysis (cf. Table
1). We assessed similarities between LRR domains of all
32 proteins considered, as detailed below. (i) In NALP2,
which is known to sense MDP, the concave and side surfaces have both hydropathy and charge distributions that
are the most similar to NAPL3, which is known to bind a
diverse set of ligands, including MDP. (ii) NALP4 and
NALP14 have similar hydropathy distributions, but dissimilar charge distributions. (iii) NALP5 and NALP8 have
hydropathy and charge distributions similar to NOD1
(except over the outer convex surface) that binds iE-DAP.
(iv) NALP6 has the shortest LRR domain, containing only
6 LRRs. Its surface properties are similar to those of TLR3,
which contains 25 LRRs. Because the hydropathy and
charge distribution moments are normalized by the
number of LRRs in a given domain, similarity of distributions still allows to hypothesize that NALP6 and TLR3
may bind the same type of ligands, RNA motifs. (v)
NALP7 charge and hydropathy are similar to NOD2 and
NALP3 both binding MDP, suggesting small molecules as
probable ligands. (vi) The high similarity of NALP8
hydropathy distribution and size to those of NOD2 and
also NOD1 (whose convex surface hydropathy is different) suggests that they may share the same type of ligands-peptidoglycans. This is also supported by similarities in
their charge distributions, with the difference being a
more positively charged convex surface of NALP8. (vii)
The hydropathy and charge of NALP9 are similar to RI,
which binds RNase, thus suggesting that the NALP9 ligand may be protein-like. (viii) NALP11 shows hydropathy
similarity with TLR7 that binds ssRNA, most likely by one
of its side surfaces. NALP11 charge distribution is similar
to that of TLR7 and also TLR3 (which binds dsRNA at its
side surface) over its side surfaces, suggesting that ss/
dsRNA is likely to be among possible NALP11 ligands.
(ix) NALP12 surface properties do not exhibit any obvious
similarity to others. (x) The hydropathy distribution of
NALP13 is similar to that of NALP7 and NOD4, but neither of them has known ligands. (xi) NALP14 charge distribution on its concave surface is almost identical to that
of IPAF, and distributions over other surfaces are similar
to IPAF. The hydropathy distributions of these two NLRs
are similar within only its concave side. Assuming that
IPAF binds flagellin similar to TLR5, i.e., on its concave
surface [44], flagellin can be considered a likely ligand of
NALP14. (xii) NOD3 hydropathy has some similarity to
NALP3, but charge distribution is unlike that in any other
domain. (xiii) NOD4 concave and side surfaces have
hydrophobicity similar to NALP12, but the charge distribution is different. Also, NOD4 appears to have the largest
ligand-binding domain of all NLRs and TLRs: it contains
as many as 43 LRRs. (xiv) NLRX1 surface features do not
exhibit similarity with any other domain. (xv) NAIP
hydropathy distribution is similar to RI, while NAIP
charge distribution is similar to TLR8.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/10/48

It is interesting to note that the functional similarities
inferred based on comparison of molecular surfaces correlate well with experimental data where available, while
hypotheses based on evolutionary relationships shown in
Figure 1 generally lack such correlation. For example,
while the surface comparison and the known experimental data suggest that NALP2 and NALP3 are activated by
the same type of molecules, MDP, the phylogenetic reconstruction places NALP2 and NALP3 into two distinct subgroups in Figure 1, although both subgroups belong to the
NALP group. Similarly, whereas IPAF and TLR5 are known
from experiment to sense a common molecule (bacterial
flagellin) with which our surface analysis is in agreement,
in the phylogenetic analysis they are placed into two distinct groups. The closest agreement between surface-based
and phylogeny-based functional inferences appears to be
between NALP5 and NALP8.
The above surface similarity considerations, which we
believe are the most interesting results of this work, are
summarized in Table 2. For each NLR with unknown ligands, we indicate to which other TLRs/NLRs its charge and
hydropathy distributions are the most similar, and based
on this infer the molecules that are likely to be its ligands.
We would like to stress that because of low resolution of
our approach, the suggested similarity-based predictions
for putative NLR ligands should be considered with care.

Discussion
In this paper we use similarities between surface features
of two families of innate immunity receptors to reason
about their possible functional similarities. The validity of
this approach is supported by results presented here - for
instance, IPAF and TLR5, which despite distant phylogenetic relationship both respond to bacterial flagellin
(regarding IPAF, see [25]), show very similar distribution
of hydrophobic surface residues (cf. Figure 4). Other
examples include similarities in binding specificities and
hydrophobic distribution moments between TLR7 and
TLR8 (both sense RNA), between CIITA and TLR5 (both
respond to protein-like targets), similar charge distribution between NOD1 and NOD2 (both respond to similarly charged iE-DAP and MDP, respectively), and
between NALP2 and NALP3 (both sense MDP) (cf.
Figure 5).
These correlations suggest that surface similarities
between NLRs and TLRs found here may reflect possible
but as yet unknown functional similarities. For most NLR
genes the binding specificities are unknown, and only
indirect functional information, such as from RNA and
protein expression profiles, is available [45]. In the following, we have attempted to put the possible predicted
functional similarities within NLR families (cf. Table 2)
into the context of what is known from such experimental
studies. We realize that the questions asked in most of

those studies have quite distant relation to the NLR
molecular surface features we focus on here, therefore
such a comparison rarely allows for definitive conclusions.
Specific cases of similarities found here include predicted
functional similarity between NALP4 and NALP14, but
this doesn't allow for any inferences as the ligands for
both are unknown; it is only known that NALP14 plays a
role in spermatogenesis and its expression is restricted to
testis [46]. The similarity between NALP5 and NALP8

indirectly correlates with the fact that their transcripts are
both detected in reproductive organs (ovaries and ovaries/
testis, respectively [45]), but again neither of their binding
specificities is known. Their surface similarity to NOD1
indicates small molecules as potential binding partners,
but in contrast to MDP it is unlikely that they are bacteriaderived. It should be noted that NALP5 was also implicated as an autoantigen in autoimmune polyendocrine
syndrome type 1 [47], and also that transient expression
of recombinant NALP1 or NALP5 in neurons was found
to induce caspase-3 activation and apoptosis [48]. NALP6

(as well as NALP12) were suggested to play a role in
immunity by activating NF-κB signaling and caspase-1dependent cytokine processing [49,50]. Here we find similarity between the very short NALP6 LRR domain and the
TLR3, which suggests NALP6 may respond to RNA motifs.

TLR8 binding ribonuclease and RNA, respectively. Murine
Naip5 (one of seven paralogue genes) was shown to be
required for intracellular response to bacterial flagellin in
mice [53], which indirectly signifies NAIP's potential for
binding protein fragments.

An interesting observation is that NALP7, which is implicated in recurrent hydatidiform moles and reproductive
wastage in humans and is known to inhibit IL-1beta upon
stimulation with such small molecules as LPS in vitro [51],
appears in our analysis to have surface features similar to
NOD2 that binds MDP. On the contrary, NALP9, whose
expression profiles indicate its localization to testis and
ovary similarly to NALP5 and NALP8, in our analysis displayed most significant similarity to RI, which implies
other proteins as possible binding partners. NALP10 lacking the LRR domain was excluded from the analyses.
NALP11 showed charge distribution similarity with TLR3
and TLR7 implying potential to bind RNA, but we are
unaware of any reports on related experimental studies.
NALP12 has been shown to suppress the non-canonical
NF-κB pathway by inducing degradation of NIK (NF-κB
inducing kinase) [52], but its ability to form an "inflammasome" still awaits experimental proof. In our analysis
NALP12 surface properties did not display similarity to
any other proteins. Similarity of NALP13 to NALP7 and to
NOD4 did not allow us to draw any functional similarity
inferences, and we are unaware of experimental studies of
this receptor. The last member of the NALP family,
NALP14, displays a controversial similarity to IPAF
because it implies bacterial flagellin as potential ligand,
while NALP14 expression is restricted to testis [46]; this
however may point to NALP14 potential role of responding to other proteins.

Results in Figures 4 and 5 also point to a significant diversity of LRR domain surface features within both TLR and
especially NLR families. This diversity is apparent even
given the low resolution of our analyses. We believe this
is mostly a consequence of the need of the receptors to
recognize a group of very diverse ligands (from small molecules to protein/RNA/DNA fragments) and their binding
modes.

Surface features of NOD3, NOD4, and NLRX1 did not
provide us with an insight to make functional inferences.
Two observations however need to be mentioned here.
First, NOD3 contains unusually large number (as many as
10) of potential N-linked glycosylation sites on its N-terminal side, unlike in any other NLR and TLR. This however likely has little relevance to possibility of actual
NOD3 glycosylation, as currently there are no reports of it
being secreted. Second, as mentioned above, NOD4
appears to have extremely large number of LRRs (as many
as 43) making its LRR domain the largest among all NLRs
and TLRs. This implies that the NOD4 LRR domain structure may possess some of the following properties untypical for NLRs: (i) in-plane circular shape with very large
radius (i.e., low curvature); (ii) nonplanar, torroid-like
shape with regular radius (normal curvature); (iii) structure consists of two or more connected circular parts each
having regular radius/curvature. The actual three-dimensional shape of this domain thus represents a puzzle.
Lastly, NAIP surface properties resemble those of RI and

Finally, in NLRs the interactions between CARD/PYR/BIR,
NACHT, and LRR domains are likely to play important
roles in their oligomerization and activation. The relative
three-dimensional orientation of the LRR, NACHT, and
effector domains is likely to vary within the NLR family,
which is signified e.g. by generally large and highly variable size of the linker domain (connecting the NACHT and
LRR domains). We believe that this could be another possible explanation of the diversity of LRR domain surface
properties within NLRs, which in turn points to the possibility of diverse ligand-induced inflammasome activation
mechanisms.

Conclusion
We have built homology models and performed quantitative analyses of charge, hydrophobicity, and glycosylation
distributions of LRR domains in almost all human NLRs
and TLRs known today. These analyses, while conducted
without experimental knowledge of NLR structures, provide a low-resolution comparison of LRR surface features
between the two protein families. The validity of our
approach is supported by several cases when receptors
that bind similar ligands were found to have similar
charge and hydrophobicity distributions. Comparison of
NLRs with unknown functions to NLRs/TLRs that have
known ligands allowed us to infer possible functional
similarities, which can not be derived from conventional
phylogenetic analyses. We hope that our predictions will
be helpful in design of future experiments to decipher
roles of previously uncharacterized NLRs in human innate
immunity. We propose an experimental study to test
whether the NLR macromolecular ligands we predict
indeed modulate the activity of caspase-1 in the presence
and absence of the corresponding NLRs in vitro. Because of
the low resolution of our approach, our predictions
should be more reliable in cases where TLR/NLR known
ligands are macromolecular fragments, such as flagellin,
ds/ssRNA, or DNA motifs. Improving the reliability of
predictions and providing quantitative estimates for relative ligand binding affinities requires combined applica-
