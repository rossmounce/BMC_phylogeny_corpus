Genomic and transcriptomic analysis of the
AP2/ERF superfamily in Vitis vinifera

Abstract
Background: The AP2/ERF protein family contains transcription factors that play a crucial role in plant growth and
development and in response to biotic and abiotic stress conditions in plants. Grapevine (Vitis vinifera) is the only
woody crop whose genome has been fully sequenced. So far, no detailed expression profile of AP2/ERF-like genes
is available for grapevine.
Results: An exhaustive search for AP2/ERF genes was carried out on the Vitis vinifera genome and their expression
profile was analyzed by Real-Time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) in different vegetative and reproductive tissues and
under two different ripening stages.
One hundred and forty nine sequences, containing at least one ERF domain, were identified. Specific clusters
within the AP2 and ERF families showed conserved expression patterns reminiscent of other species and grapevine
specific trends related to berry ripening. Moreover, putative targets of group IX ERFs were identified by coexpression and protein similarity comparisons.
Conclusions: The grapevine genome contains an amount of AP2/ERF genes comparable to that of other dicot
species analyzed so far. We observed an increase in the size of specific groups within the ERF family, probably due
to recent duplication events. Expression analyses in different aerial tissues display common features previously
described in other plant systems and introduce possible new roles for members of some ERF groups during fruit
ripening. The presented analysis of AP2/ERF genes in grapevine provides the bases for studying the molecular
regulation of berry development and the ripening process.

Background
The AP2/ERF superfamily is one of the largest groups of
transcription factors in plants [1]. It includes all genes
coding for at least one APETALA2 (AP2) domain and
can be further separated into the ETHYLENE
RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF), the AP2, and the RAV
families. The AP2 domain, which is responsible for
DNA binding, was named after the Arabidopsis thaliana
APETALA2 protein identified by Jofuku et al. [2]. Subsequently, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) transcription
factors containing a motif related to the AP2 domain
were also identified [3]. Since these proteins are able to
bind an ethylene responsive DNA element (AGCCGCC),
they were classified as ERFs (Ethylene Responsive

Factors) and their DNA binding domain was named
after them [4].
The subdivision of the AP2/ERF group into families is
based on the number of AP2 domains present in the
proteins, together with the presence of other DNA binding domains. The AP2 family contains proteins with a
double, tandem repeated, AP2 domain [5]. The ERF
family genes code for transcription factors with a single
AP2 domain. Lastly, the RAV family encodes proteins
possessing a single AP2 domain plus an additional B3
domain, which is also present in other, non-ERF transcription factors [6].
Two major efforts to define a nomenclature for ERF
sequences have been published. Sakuma et al. [7]
divided the Arabidopsis ERF family into two subfamilies
based on the amino acid sequence of the DNA binding
domain: the CBF/DREB subfamily (group A) and the
ERF-like subfamily (group B), both further subdivided in
six groups. Nakano et al. [8] on the other hand,

Licausi et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:719
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/719

proposed an innovative classification for Arabidopsis
ERFs, based on the amino acid sequence of the whole
proteins, splitting the family into ten groups.
Despite the relatively high sequence conservation of
the AP2/ERF domain, the number of DNA elements
bound by different AP2/ERF transcription factors is
extremely wide [[3,9] and [10]].
The DREB group interacts with the core sequence
CCGAC [11], while the ERF group typically binds to an
AGCCGCC sequence, called GCC box [3].
In the AP2 family, a binding element gCAC(A/G)N(A/
T)TcCC(a/g)ANG(c/t) has been reported for the protein
AINTEGUMENTA (ANT) [12], and the same sequence
was shown to be bound by five other AP2 members
[13]. This DNA element is quite distinct from the consensus sequence CCGA/CC bound by the DREB/ERF
group and, surprisingly, is not composed of two similar
half sites, since the AP2 proteins contain a double AP2
domain [14].
AP2/ERF transcription factors regulate a number of
biological processes including development, reproduction, responses to hormones, adaptation to biotic and
abiotic stresses [15-18] and [19].
After the release of the whole genomic sequences of
several plant organisms, including Arabidopsis, rice
(Oryza sativa) and poplar (Populus tricocarpa), the AP2/
ERF transcription factor superfamily was analyzed, both
to place each member in an organized nomenclature
system, and to provide maps of their expression. To
date, two full genome sequences of highly homozygous
and heterozygous grapevine (Vitis vinifera) Pinot noir
genotypes have been carried out [[20,21] and [22]].
These two milestones provided a useful genomic platform to study this fruit crop. As AP2/ERF transcription
factors are involved in flower development and tolerance
to biotic and abiotic stresses, their superfamily represents one of the best pools to investigate, when searching for important grapevine traits. Since genome scale
analyses of the transcriptional response to the development and environmental stimuli require a precise and
complete annotation in order to provide reliable and
exhaustive data, we decided to annotate the ERF family
members and create a qRT-PCR platform that allows
investigating their expression profile.
A recent study suggested that 132 genes encoding
AP2/ERF proteins are present in the grapevine genome
[23]. However, a higher number of AP2/ERF genes is
present in Arabidopsis and poplar genomes (147 and
202 sequences, respectively). We therefore re-screened
the grapevine genome for AP2/ERF sequences, adopting
two different strategies, in order to accurately identify
AP2/ERF-like sequences in the Vitis vinifera genome.
In this study we provide a characterization of the grapevine AP2/ERF transcription factor superfamily and

Page 2 of 15

demonstrate that it is in fact composed of almost 149
genes. Moreover, using qRT-PCR platform encompassing the whole ERF/AP2 superfamily, we show how AP2/
ERF-like genes are expressed in both vegetative and
reproductive tissues at different developmental stages,
and we infer roles and putative targets for some of these
genes. Overall, our analysis suggests that AP2/ERF proteins play a strong role in ripening-related processes.

Results
Identification of the AP2/ERF family transcription factors
in Vitis vinifera

As result of an extensive search for AP2-domain containing proteins, 149 distinct AP2/ERF putative TFs
were identified (Additional file 1, Table S1). One hundred and twenty two genes encoding for proteins with a
single AP2/ERF domain were assigned to the ERF superfamily. The AP2 family was grouped into 20 genes, that
could be identified due to the tandem repeated double
AP2/ERF motif. Six genes, containing a single AP2/ERF
DNA binding domain together with a B3 type domain,
were assigned to the RAV family. A single AP2 protein,
GIDVvP00018355001, showed a low similarity to the
other ERF sequences although it is homologous to the
Arabidopsis ERF transcription factor At4g13040. A similar gene has also been identified in P. trichocarpa and
named Soloist [24]. Surprisingly, the Vitis gene annotated as Soloist in the grapevine genome by Zhuang et
al. [23] is not homologous to the poplar Soloist. Zhuang
et al. [23] named protein sequence GSVIVP000
25602001 as Soloist, although its similarity to the
sequences of Arabidopsis At4g13040 and PtSoloist is
rather low. On the other hand, GIDVvP00018355001 is
the closest homolog of both At4g13040 and PtSoloist in
the grapevine genome (Additional file 2, Figure S2).
Previous annotations of AP2/ERF genes in poplar [24]
and grapevine [23] followed the nomenclature proposed
by Sakuma et al. [7], based on a homology of the DNA
binding domain alone. However, Nakano et al. [8] proposed an alternative method, based on the presence of
domains that were different from the DNA binding
domain. Therefore we subdivided the grapevine ERF
genes into 11 groups, according to their similarity to the
Arabidopsis ERF sequences. Amino acid motifs located
outside the DNA binding domain are conserved among
the Arabidopsis [8] and Vitis ERF proteins (Additional
file 3, Table S3).
Taken as a whole, the ERF/AP2 superfamily has a similar number of genes in grapevine (149) and Arabidopsis
(147), while it is bigger in poplar (202) and rice (180).
The number of RAV genes is highly conserved among
species with six members in dicots and five genes in rice.
The AP2 family encompasses a similar number of genes
in V. Vinifera (20) and A. Thaliana (19), while this

Number of genes present in each family and group within the AP2/ERF superfamily in the plant species whose genome has been fully sequenced. A comparison

increases to 26 in poplar and 29 in rice (Table 1). The
Soloist protein, coded by a single-copy gene and characterized by a low conservation at the ERF DNA-binding
domain, was present in all the plant genomes considered.
Although the overall number of sequences belonging to
the ERF family was conserved in grapevine and Arabidopsis, noteworthy differences existed between groups
(Table 1). Group III, VIII and X had a very similar number of genes (Vitis to Arabidopsis ratio lower than 1.25 or
greater than 0.7). On the other hand, groups II, IV, VI,
VII, and VI-L in Vitis vinifera contained half the number
of members than Arabidopsis (Table 1). The opposite
trend was observed for groups V and IX, where the number of members was more than double compared to Arabidopsis. Interestingly, in the poplar genome, group IX
and V genes were also more than the twice their Arabidopsis counterparts. The poplar genome appeared to
have a higher number of ERF genes in most of the
groups. ERF proteins belonging to the Xb-like group
were not found in the grapevine genome.
Accuracy of protein predictions

Proteins sequences from the Genoscope database have
been deduced using an automated method [25]. However, this methodology is prone to errors [26]. We
found similar issues in grapevine predictions. In fact,
some gene annotations and intron junctions did not
match those of the Arabidopsis and poplar homologs.
We found unrealistic introns of 8.4 and 35 Kb predicted

in GSVIVP00009519001 and in GSVIVT0009456001
gene models respectively. Moreover the gene models
GSVIVT00021812001, GSVIVP00013482001, GSVIVT
00019482001, and GSVIVP00007524001 were predicted
to encode proteins that contained two or more ERF
domains. Since both of these sequences were homologous to Arabidopsis proteins belonging to the ERF
family and not to the AP2 family, we decided to split
each gene model into sequences encoding a single ERF
domain protein, using the closest Arabidopsis protein as
a template (GSVIVT00021812001: VvERF014 and
VvERF016; GSVIVP00013482001: VvERF029 and
VvERF030; GSVIVT00019482001: VvERF115, VvERF116
and VvERF119; GSVIVP00007524001: VvERF101 and
VvERF102). In order to test whether the prediction of
these dubious genes was correct, we compared the production of amplicons corresponding to single exons
with that of the predicted cDNA derived from exonjoining. The absence of an amplicon that corresponded
to exon joining, together with the correct amplification
of the single exon, was interpreted as an indication of
misprediction. The gene model GSVIVT00034010001,
which is supported by cDNA report evidence, was
used as a positive control. No amplification was
obtained using primers annealing to the N- and C- terminus of GSVIVT00009519001, GSVIVT0009456001
and GSVIVT00021812001, although an amplicon of the
expected size was obtained using primers that anneal
within the exons (Additional file 4, Figure S4). Since the

Licausi et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:719
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/719

present results revealed the possibility that other gene
structure predictions were partly incorrect, all dubious
sequences were checked and, where necessary, corrected, using Arabidopsis and poplar closest homologs
as templates (Additional file 1, Table S1).
Phylogenetic analysis

In order to investigate the evolutionary relatedness of
the identified sequences, together with the ERF genes
encoded by the other fully sequenced plant species, we
performed a sequence-based phylogenetic analysis.
The resulting phylogenetic tree (Figure 1) shows 15
clades, which correspond, according to Sakuma et al. [7]
and Nakano et al. [8], to the ERF, the AP2 and the RAV
superfamilies. The ERF superfamily is subdivided into
10 clades, which correspond to the group I-X as
described by Nakano et al. [8]. Although the VvSoloist
transcription factor contains a single AP2 domain, it
clusters together with the AP2 superfamily. Zhuang et
al. [23] identified two recent duplication events in the
grapevine genome: one occurring for members of the B3
group (VvERFB3-5 and VvERFB3-6, corresponding to
VvERF099 and VvERF100 in this study) and the second
in the DREB group (VvDREB-A4-12 and VvDREB-A4-13
corresponding to VvERF014 and VvERF016, respectively). However, we did not find a perfect identity
between VvERF014 and VvERF016 (Additional file 5,
Figure S5). Instead, we identified 17 genes encoding for
ERF-IX proteins characterized by a high sequence similarity (highlighted in red in Additional file 1, Table S1).
Four of these genes (VvERF080, VvERF082, VvERF083
and VvERF085) maintained a high sequence similarity at
a nucleotide level, outside the coding sequence

approximately 50 downstream and 150 bp upstream
(Additional file 6, Figure S6).
Chromosome position of the identified Vitis vinifera
AP2/ERF genes

The AP2/ERF genes were distributed unevenly among
the nineteen chromosomes of the grapevine genome
(Figure 2). Thirteen genes could not be assigned to any
specific chromosome. Chromosomes 3 and 12 appeared
to contain only one ERF gene each, followed by chromosome 13 (2 genes) and 1-10-17-19 (4 genes). The
highest number of ERF genes was found on chromosomes 7 and 16, with 20 and 22 genes respectively. The
high number of AP2/ERF sequences in these two chromosomes is mainly due to the presence of a close repetition of genes belonging to the same group. On
chromosome 7, the ERF groups IX and X accounted for
25% and 40% of the total ERF genes, respectively. This
feature is even more evident in chromosome 16, where
group IX accounted for over 90% of the total amount of
AP2/ERF genes. The repetition of genes in close distances seemed to be a typical feature of group IX. Interestingly, the same trend was observed for the
chromosomal location of group IX (group B3 according
to Sakuma et al., [7]) in the poplar genome [24]. As
already observed for MIKC gene subfamilies [26], also
AP2/ERF genes belonging to the same group were
located in chromosomal regions, which have been suggested to represent paralogous segments resulting from
ancestral polyploidization events [[20] and [22]]. For
instance VvERF018, VvERF019, VvERF022, VvERF027
(group III) are located on chromosomes 2, 15, and 16;
VvAP2-1, VvAP2-6, VvAP2-9 and VvAP2-10 are located
on chromosomes 9 and 11. Closely related members of
the group V (VvERF042 to VvER0F47) are located on
the chromosomes belonging to the same paralogous segment. Moreover, 50% of the ERF group VIII is located
on chromosomes 10, 12 and 19 (VvERF061, VvERF062,
VvERF063, VvERF064 and VvERF066).

et al., 2007). The distance bar is shown on the bottom of the tree.

Grape and wine production is strongly affected by environmental cues and pathogens during the development
of the plant. Since AP2/ERF genes have been reported
to play a role in plant development and in responses to
biotic and abiotic stresses, they represent ideal candidates to investigate the molecular regulation of these
processes. Although microarray platforms exist for the
grape genome, realtime-qPCR (RT-qPCR) is a very sensitive and cost-effective technique to analyze the expression of genes with rather low expression levels, such as
transcription factors [27]. We therefore designed a qRTPCR platform to analyze the expression of all 149 AP2/

ERF genes in the aerial vegetative and reproductive tissues of Vitis vinifera Cv. Corvina (Additional file 7,
Table S7). The expression patterns of the genes encoding for members of the ERF, AP2 and RAV families are
shown in Figure 3 (ERF family) and in Figure 4 (AP2
and RAV families). ERF family members (Figure 3) were
subdivided according to their respective group (I to X).
Only five genes (VvERF019, VvERF081, VvERF088,
VvRAV5 and VvRAV6) did not reach a detectable
expression level in any of the tissues considered.

Fourteen genes (VvERF004, VvERF005, VvERF007,
VvERF037, VvERF057, VvERF059, VvERF062, VvERF063,
VvERF064, VvERF076, VvERF117, VvERF121, VvERF122
and VvAP2-20) showed high expression levels in all tissues analyzed, irrespectively of the developmental stage
considered.
A broad variability of expression patterns within families
and groups was observed: for instance, in the ERF group
V, VvERF042 and VvERF043 were highly expressed in
leaf, inflorescence and stem tissues while VvERF046 and

was measured by RT-qPCR in aerial vegetative (leaves and stems) and reproductive (inflorescence, berry skin and berry flesh) tissues. For berry
and skin tissues two developmental stages (veraison and full ripeness) were analyzed. The relative expression value was calculated according to
the formula CtHK-CtGene. The results shown are from at least three independent replicates. Hierarchical clustering was used to represent the gene
expression within each family.

together with a big group of AP2 genes (VvAP2-09,
VvAP2-11, VvAP2-12, VvAP215, VvAP2-17, VvAP2-18
and VvAP2-19) (Figure 4). Surprisingly, none of the AP2coding genes, which have been reported to play a role in
flower development, were exclusively expressed in the
inflorescence tissues (Figure 4).
Expression pattern similarity did not mimic the
sequence similarity of ERF group IX. For instance,
VvERF084 and VvERF085, which share more than 95%
similarity, exhibited different expression patterns in fruit
tissues and VvERF109 displayed stem specificity whereas
its closest paralog, VvERF110, was poorly expressed in
the same tissue.
Ripening regulated AP2/ERF genes in grape berry

Figure 4 Expression profile of V. vinifera AP2 and RAV genes.
The expresssion of all AP2 and RAV genes identified in this study
was measured by RT-qPCR in aerial vegetative (leaves and stems)
and reproductive (inflorescence, berry skin and berry flesh) tissues.
For berry and skin tissues two developmental stages (veraison and
full ripeness) were analyzed. The relative expression value was
calculated according to the formula CtHK-CtGene. The results shown
are from at least three independent replicates.

VvERF047 reached high levels in the flesh of ripe berries
(Figure 3). Very few genes exhibited a specific single tissue expression: VvERF103 mRNA was barely detectable
except in leaf tissues, VvERF114 was highly expressed in
flesh tissues of the berry at the veraison stage and
VvAP2-03 showed a strong induction in skin tissues
during ripening (Figure 4).
Three ERF genes displayed a high expression in leaves,
stems and inflorescences and low levels in the berry tissues considered: VvERF027 (group III of the ERF family),
VvERF042 and VvERF043 (ERF group V) (Figure 3),

AP2 and ERF related transcription factors are assumed
to play a role in fruit development during the ripening
process in several species [[28,29] and [30]]. To identify
AP2/ERF genes whose expression changes during the
transition from veraison to full ripeness (stage III
according to Deluc et al. [31]), we analyzed the mRNA
levels of 149 AP2/ERF genes identified in skin and flesh
tissues.
Three genes increased their mRNA levels during
ripening in both skin and flesh berry tissues (VvERF072,
VvERF103 and VvAP2-3) and only VvERF018 decreased
its expression (Tables 2, 3). The highest number of differentially expressed AP2/ERF genes occurred in the
skin tissues, where 31 genes were up-regulated at least 4
fold, and 18 genes were down regulated (≤-4 fold)
(Table 2 and Figure 5). The opposite trend was observed
in the flesh tissues, where 18 genes were induced and 30
repressed. In all groups of differentially expressed genes
(DEGs), the ERF IX group was the most represented
(Tables 2, 3), although only among the up-regulated
ERF genes in the skin tissues the overrepresentation was
significant (P-value≤0.05). Within the ERF family, at
least one member from almost every group sequence
changed its expression from veraison to full ripeness. In
Arabidopsis and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), transcription factors belonging to the ERF group IX, such as
AtERF1 and SlPti4, are involved in the regulation of
plant response to biotic and abiotic stresses mediated by
ethylene and jasmonates [29,32]. Direct targets of
AtERF1 include pathogenesis related proteins, chitinases
and b-1,3-glucanases. Therefore it is tempting to speculate that the ERF genes belonging to group IX regulate
proteins involved in stress responses in grapes.
To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the expression of
genes encoding for b-1,3 glucanases (VvGlucb-1,
VvGlucb-2), class IV chitinase (VvChit4-1) and pathogenesis related proteins (VvPR10.1 and VvPR10L-b)
using RT-qPCR. VvGlucb-1 and VvGlucb-2, VvChit4-1,
VvPR10.1 and VvPR10L-b were induced in the transition

(Additional file 8, Figure S8). The same trend was
observed for several ERF-IX genes including VvERF086,
VvERF093 and VvERF098 (Figure 3 and Additional file
8, Figure S8). Moreover, the expression profile of ERFIX VvERF078 and VvERF085 is highly correlated with
that of genes encoding chitinases, b 1,3-glucanases and
thaumatin during different stages of berry development
in the dataset published by Deluc et al. [31] (Additional
file 9, Figure S9).
Only the VII group, which contains three members,
was not represented in any of the DEG lists (Figure 3,
Tables 2, 3). Four AP2 genes were induced and two
were repressed in the skin during the ripening phase

considered, whereas in the flesh only one gene was upregulated and two were down-regulated (Tables 2, 3).

Discussion
Comparison of the AP2/ERF superfamily across sequenced
plant genomes

In this study, a comprehensive search for genes encoding for AP2/ERF transcription factors encoded in the
Vitis vinifera genome was carried out, leading to the
identification of 149 genes. Previously, 132 AP2/ERF
genes had been annotated, as reported by Zhuang et al.
[23]. Eighteen newly identified genes encoded transcription factors belonging to groups II (VvERF013), III
(VvERF028 and VvERF029), V (VvERF041), VIII

VvERF071, VvERF073 and VvERF074), IX (VvERF094)
and X (VvERF118 and VvERF121) of the ERF family, to
the AP2 family (VvAP2-12 and VvAP2-17) and the RAV
family (VvRAV3 and VvRAV5) (Additional file 1, Table
S1). Our analysis did not identify GSVIVP00019513001
as an ERF gene due to its short sequence and the presence of two long introns. It is likely that this locus constitutes a pseudogene. This number of genes is
comparable with that of Arabidopsis but is only 70% of
the number found in poplar and 80% of the rice AP2/
ERF superfamily (Table 1).
The availability of the complete genome sequence of
three dicot species and one monocot enabled a comparison of individual families and groups using Nakano

et al.’s criteria [8]. Several ERF groups (II, III, VI, VII,
VIII, IX, X, VI-L and Xb-L) and the AP2 family contained more members in poplar than in grape and Arabidopsis (Table 1). A feature common to both woody
species Vitis vinifera and Populus trichocarpa is the
lower number of genes in group I in the ERF family and
the higher number in groups V and IX. In Medicago
truncatula, WXP1, a group I ERF, contributes to
drought tolerance by regulating the accumulation of
cuticular waxes [33] while, in Arabidopsis, this function
is performed by the SHYNE clade of ERF genes (SHN13), all belonging to group V [34]. Therefore, it is possible that the function of group I and V overlaps and the
increase in group V in woody dicot species poises the
lower number of group I genes. The expression of

homologs of the Arabidopsis SHN clade, VvERF043 and
VvERF044, in fruit skin tissues (Figure 3) is not unexpected, since waxy layers are produced to cover the
grape berries [35].
Compared to all the species considered in this study,
the grapevine genome has very small ERF-group II and
VII. In Arabidopsis, the ERF-VII genes are highly
expressed, suggesting to be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. Interestingly, also VvERF057 and
VvERF059 are highly expressed in all the tissues analysed in this study.
ERF-IX is the largest ERF group in poplar and grape
genomes, since it is almost twice as big as Arabidopsis
and rice (Table 1). Of the 40 ERF-IX genes identified,
17 exhibited a high sequence similarity not limited to
the coding sequence but also extended to the 5’and 3’
surrounding regions (Additional file 6, Figure S6). However, since the expression profiles of these genes did not
overlap completely, it is likely that their expression is
driven by different promoter sequences. Interestingly,
members of group IX displayed a particular clustered
organization along chromosomes 7 and 16 (Figure 2),
similar to the one observed in the poplar genome for
the same group, although in this species the tandem
repetition does not exceed four genes.
The tandem repetition of almost identical coding
sequences suggests that these duplication events in the
grapevine genome are quite recent. Moreover, it is

tempting to speculate on the molecular mechanisms that
led to the formation of such a long cluster of almost
identical sequences, maybe involving the interaction of
transposons or retroposons with the genomic sequence
encoding ERF-IX genes. Magnani et al. [36] showed that
a cyanobacterium (Trichodesmium erythraeum) possesses
a HNH endonuclease protein with an AP2 DNA binding
domain and suggested that the AP2 sequence approached
the plant genome as a lateral transfer from a viral or bacterial donor. Gene duplication is more likely to be
retained for gene families involved in signal transduction
and transcriptional regulation [37]. Nakano et al. [8] suggested that an increased number of genes in groups III
and IX might improve plant fitness since these genes are
involved in the regulation of environmental stress
responses. However, many other ERF groups, which do
not have a high number of members, play a role in stress
responses [8]. Therefore, the functional role of the ERFIX group alone does not seem enough to explain the high
number of genes in this family and their repetition on
chromosomes. Further analyses of the nucleotidic and
amino acid sequences of the genes belonging to this
family are likely to shed light on this topic.
Genes belonging to the RAV family are highly conserved among dicot species, which contain six members,
and not very different in rice (5 members) [38].
The number of AP2 genes is very similar between
Arabidopsis (18) and Vitis (19) and lower than that of

Licausi et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:719
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/719

poplar (29 members) (Table 1). The generally higher
number of AP2/ERF genes in the poplar genome is
likely to be a consequence of a recent whole-genome
duplication in the poplar lineage [39]. Curiously, a divergent member of the AP2 family, whose poplar homolog
has been called Soloist, is maintained in a single copy in
all plant genomes analyzed so far. The conservativeness
of the sequence, plus the fact that it is only weakly
related to other AP2/ERF genes, suggests that this gene
diverged from the AP2 family early in the evolution of
the plant species. Surprisingly, it also maintained its single copy feature during the separation of the monocot
and dicot and the spread of the eurosid clade [20].
Differential expression of AP2/ERF genes in aerial tissues
of Vitis vinifera

The development of an RT-qPCR platform (Additional
file 7, Table S7) encompassing the complete number of
AP2/ERF genes previously identified, together with
knowledge about the molecular function of their homolog in other plant species, may help in associating a role
with some of these transcription factors.
Traditionally, the expression of ERF genes has been
associated with the molecular response to ethylene,
from which their acronym derives. Although AP2/ERF
transcription factors are regulated by a number of physical-chemical stimuli, many ERF genes are indeed ethylene responsive and therefore have been suggested as
being involved in the ripening process in climacteric
fruits. Wine grape is considered to be a non-climacteric
fruit but ethylene still plays an important role during
development and ripening processes such as anthocyanin accumulation [40] and alcohol dehydrogenase
expression [41].
Although many ERF genes have been shown to play a
role in the response to abiotic and biotic stresses, only a
few genes have been described as regulators of organ
development. Two homologues of the developmentrelated ERFs AtLEP and AtBOL, VvERF067 and
VvERF068, are constantly expressed in the berry skin
tissues, whereas a vitis homolog of the cytokinin responsive factors exhibits leaf-specific expression.
Many members of the groups II, III and IX
(VvERF085, VvERF087 and VvERF089) were highly
expressed in all the tissues examined (Figure 3). In Arabidopsis, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and tomato
(Solanum lycopersicum), ERFs belonging to groups II
and III play a role in response to abiotic stress [[42] and
[43]] whereas group IX includes genes involved in the
response to pathogens [[44] and [45]]. The relatively
high expression of members of these groups in grapevine tissues, under non stress conditions, may represent
a default defence system, which was already present
before the pathogen attack or the environmental stress

Page 11 of 15

took place, activated only when a trigger signal is
perceived.
AP2 and RAV genes are the main actors in the determination of cell fate and development from meristems
to fully developed organs. However, with the exception
of VvAP2-5, the expression of AP2 and RAV genes in
the tissues considered was not restricted to a single
organ. On the other hand, VvAP2-5 is mainly expressed
in the inflorescence tissues (Figure 4).
Contrary to what was expected, the expression homolog of the AP2 gene, VvAP2-11, VvAP2-14 and VvAP215, was not restricted to floral organs but extended to
vegetative and fruit tissues (Figure 4). VvAP2-9, VvAP211, VvAP2-12 and VvAP2-17, which are homologs of
the Arabidopsis AIL-5, AP2, TOE1 and ANT genes
respectively, had a similar expression pattern, with the
highest expression in the leaf, inflorescence and stem,
but not in the fruit tissues (Figure 4). No member of the
AP2 or RAV family showed a fruit-specific expression
pattern.
Several ERF-IX members (VvERF074, VvERF079,
VvERF085, VvERF086, VvERF098, VvERF099, and
VvERF100) reached high mRNA levels in the skin tissues of the berry, but not in the flesh tissues (Figure 3).
This differential expression between skin and flesh
among members of group IX may reflect the need for a
constantly activated defence in the skin of the berry,
which is continuously exposed to pathogens attack. This
was not the case however in the flesh tissues, where
bacteria and fungi can only be present once the physical
barrier of the skin has been penetrated.
Expression changes of grapevine AP2/ERF genes in the
veraison to full ripeness transition

Skin and flesh tissues from grape berries differ greatly
during the transition from veraison to full ripeness with
respect to ERF-gene expression. In the skin, 31 genes
were up-regulated at least four-fold and 18 were downregulated. In the flesh tissues, only 18 AP2/ERF genes
were up-regulated and 30 down-regulated (Figure 5).
Group IX contained most of the genes induced or
repressed by ripening in both skin and flesh tissues of
the grapevine berry (Figure 5). Members of the same
group are up-regulated in apple and plum fruit during
ripening [28,46]. Deluc et al. [31] identified a small
number of ERF IX as being differentially regulated
throughout the development of the grape berry. This
was either due to the sensitivity limitation of the microarray technique or because the transcriptome of skin
and flesh tissues was not analyzed separately. The ripening-related induction of many members of group IX
suggests that the skin cells need to be prepared against
pathogen attack in a phase during which the berry is
enriched with sugars and therefore represents the ideal

Licausi et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:719
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/719

substrate for pathogen growth. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that VvGlucb-1, VvGlucb-2, VvChit41, VvPR10.1 and VvPR10L-b were up-regulated during
ripening, preferentially in the skin tissues, together with
ERFs belonging to group IX (Additional file 8, Figure
S8). In addition, in a more extensive series of developmental stages in whole berries (Deluc et al. [31]), the
expression of stress-related genes correlated with that of
ERF-IX members (Additional file 9, Figure S9). Moreover, increased levels of PR proteins and chitinases during the transition from veraison to ripening have been
reported for grape Barbera cultivar [47]. In wine, PR
proteins represent one of the most abundant classes of
proteins [31]. Since they can negatively affect wine
clarity and stability, their regulation may represent an
important trait for improving wine quality.
The ERF-V VvERF042 and VvERF046, homologs of
the Arabidopsis SHN1 gene, were induced in both skin
and flesh tissues, while VvERF044 was repressed. An
up-regulation of group V members during berry development was also reported by Deluc et al. [31]. In Arabidopsis, SHN1 regulates lipid biosynthetic pathways
towards cutin synthesis [48], while a barley SHN1homolog regulates lipid anabolism to generate organ
adhesion [49]. Of the direct targets of SHN1, Kannangara et al. [48] identified the Long Acyl-coA synthetase
2 (LACS2), which is required for cutin biosynthesis in
wild-type plants. Interestingly, in Vitis vinifera cv.
Cabernet, VvLACS7, a homolog of the Arabidopsis
LACS2, was reported to be up-regulated during ripening
[48] and its expression highly correlates with VvERF046
in the same subset (Spearman correlation coefficient
0.92). An equal number of ERF-III genes was induced
and repressed in the skin, whereas only two were upregulated in the flesh tissues (Tables 2, 3). Group III
encodes transcription factors involved in the crosstalk
between biotic and abiotic stress [50] and therefore may
play a similar role as group IX during the last phases of
ripening in the berry. Members of group IV, which were
also involved in stress response regulation, were induced
in the skin but not in the flesh (Table 2). The ripening
related induction of group VIII-ERF has already been
reported in plums [[30] and [51]]. Also in the grape
berry, three members were up-regulated in the skin tissues (Table 2).
Previous studies on ripening regulated transcripts
identified members of the group VII as being associated with ripening [[28] and [46]]. However, in our
transcriptional analysis, none of the three ERF-VII
genes showed a differential expression in the berry
skin or flesh in the transition from veraison to full
ripeness (Figure 3). It is possible that the ripeningrelated induction of these genes occurs at earlier stages
of the ripening process.

Page 12 of 15

Two AP2 genes, VvAP2-5 and VvAP2-16, homologs to
the Arabidopsis PTL3 (AIL-6) and PTL4 (BBM), respectively were strongly up-regulated in skin tissues during
ripening, whereas an AIL-9 homolog, VvAP2-9, was
repressed. In Arabidopsis, The PTL proteins act in a
dose-dependent way to regulate stem cell maintenance
and meristem boundaries in Arabidopsis, probably by
PIN-dependent auxin distribution [[52] and [53]]. Their
function in fruit development has not yet been studied;
however they represent interesting candidates as regulators of the transition from different ripening stages. The
RAV gene VvRAV2 was up-regulated in the skin tissues
(Table 2). Its closest Arabidopsis homolog, RAV2, has
been proposed to act as repressor, through the RLFGV
motif located at the C-terminus [54]. Since VvRAV2
maintained the presence of this motif, it is possible to
hypothesize a similar molecular activity.

Conclusions
In summary, in this study we identified 149 AP2/ERF
genes in the grape genome and characterized their
expression patterns in aerial vegetative, inflorescence
and berry skin and flesh at two different ripening stages,
veraison and full ripening. A comparison of homologs
from other species, whose genome has been sequenced,
together with their expression profiles, may help in an
understanding of the role of these transcription factors
in perennial plants. Vitis vinifera represent the only
woody plant whose genome is fully sequenced and
whose commercial value is due to fruit production.
Unveiling the role of AP2/ERF transcription factors in
the developmental and ripening processes in this species, may help molecular breeders in improving fruit
quality.
Methods
Identification of Vitis AP2/ERF genomic sequences

A search of the Vitis vinifera genome database was performed in order to find all members of the AP2/ERF
family. A double strategy to obtain every gene of the AP2/
ERF family in the genome was used. The sequences of all
members of the ERF family in the genome of Arabidopsis
thaliana were downloaded from the DATF database [55]
and the amino acid sequence of one or most representative
members (i.e. the maximum number of different conserved
motifs distinctive of each group) for each group defined by
Nakano et al. [8] were used as queries to search the grapevine genome database (Genoscope, CEA - Institut de génomique, France) using the BLAT program [56]. We also
used the consensus sequence of the ERF domain to search
the Vitis genome database on the NCBI web site. Every
sequence identified was subsequently checked against the
Arabidopsis and Poplar protein databases to confirm that it
belonged to the AP2/ERF superfamily. As a final quality

Licausi et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:719
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/719

check, we confirmed the presence of the AP2 domain in
every AP2/ERF Vitis vinifera gene candidate using SMART
[57].
Phylogenetic Analysis

Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were
conducted using MEGA version 4 [58]. To generate a
phylogenetic tree, complete AP2/ERF predicted proteins
Vitis vinifera were aligned using the ClustalW algorithm
version 2.0 [59]. The neighbour-joining method was
used to construct different trees, using the pair-wise
deletion option. The reliability of the obtained trees was
tested using bootstrapping with 1000 replicates.
Gene prediction testing

Genomic sequences predicted to encode ERF genes that
contained introns longer than 10 kb or that do not exist
in Arabidopsis or poplar were considered as not reliable
and four were (GSVIVT00021812001, GSVIVP000
13482001, GSVIVT00019482001, and GSVIVP0000
7524001) chosen as examples. A primer pair annealing
to the beginning and the end of the predicted coding
sequence was used to check the reliability of the prediction. Primer pairs annealing within exons of the predicted coding sequence were used as controls to test
that the gene considered was indeed expressed in the
cDNA sample used. GSVIVT00034010001 was used as a
positive control, since its coding sequence has also been
predicted by EST analyses and its structure is strongly
conserved by its homologues in different plant species
such as potato, rice, Arabidopsis, sorrel (Licausi et al.

Total RNA, extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, was subjected to DNase treatment using the TURBO DNA-free
kit (Ambion). Five micrograms of each sample were
reverse transcribed into cDNA using the Superscript III
reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR
amplification was carried out with the ABI Prism 6900
sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems), using a
power sybr-green master mix (Applied Biosystems)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Gene-specific primers (Additional file 7, Table S7) were designed
on regions not interrupted by introns using Quantprime
software [60], tested for the specificity of each amplification reaction. This was done by analyzing the dissociation curves of each amplicon and the primer efficiency
was calculated using LinReg [61]. For all primer pairs
and for all samples, the primer efficiency was between
1.7 and 2.0. Data were analyzed using 6900 SDS software 1.3 (Applied Biosystems). Dissociation curves for
each amplicon were analyzed in order to verify the

specificity of each amplification reaction. Transcript
levels were normalized against the average of the grapevine housekeeping (HK) genes: EF1- gene (BQ799343),
the ubiquitin gene (VvUB; CF406001), the actin gene
(AB073011) and the glyceraldehydes dehydrogenase
gene (EF192466). Relative gene expression in the transcriptomic analysis considering the different plant tissues was obtained by the formula CtHK-CtGene, where Ct
is the cycle number at which a reaction reaches a specified fluorescence level. Hierarchical clustering of the
gene expression data was performed using R software.
For the relative gene expression level related to the
ripening, the ΔΔCt [62] method was employed. Statistical analysis of ERF group overrepresentation among differentially expressed genes was performed applying the
Fisher’s Exact test [63].
