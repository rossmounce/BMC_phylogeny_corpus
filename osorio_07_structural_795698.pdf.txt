Abstract
Background: Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is a primordial process in
development and its dysregulation has a central role in the pathogenesis of many diseases.
Angiogenin (ANG), a peculiar member of the RNase A superfamily, is a potent inducer of
angiogenesis involved in many different types of cancer, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and also with
a possible role in the innate immune defense. The evolutionary path of this family has been a highly
dynamic one, where positive selection has played a strong role. In this work we used a combined
gene and protein level approach to determine the main sites under diversifying selection on the
primate ANG gene and analyze its structural and functional implications.
Results: We obtained evidence for positive selection in the primate ANG gene. Site specific
analysis pointed out 15 sites under positive selection, most of which also exhibited drastic changes
in amino acid properties. The mapping of these sites in the ANG 3D-structure described five
clusters, four of which were located in functional regions: two in the active site region, one in the
nucleolar location signal and one in the cell-binding site. Eight of the 15 sites under selection in the
primate ANG gene were highly or moderately conserved in the RNase A family, suggesting a
directed event and not a simple consequence of local structural or functional permissiveness.
Moreover, 11 sites were exposed to the surface of the protein indicating that they may influence
the interactions performed by ANG.
Conclusion: Using a maximum likelihood gene level analysis we identified 15 sites under positive
selection in the primate ANG genes, that were further corroborated through a protein level
analysis of radical changes in amino acid properties. These sites mapped onto the main functional
regions of the ANG protein. The fact that evidence for positive selection is present in all ANG
regions required for angiogenesis may be a good indication that angiogenesis is the process under
selection. However, other possibilities to be considered arise from the possible involvement of
ANG in innate immunity and the potential influence or co-evolution with its interacting proteins
and ligands.

Background
Angiogenesis, the physiological process involving the
growth of new blood vessels, is a primordial process in
development. The complex network of interactions
between pro- and anti-angiogenic regulators dictates that
any imbalance in this process can lead to disease. Indeed,
angiogenesis plays a central role in the pathophysiology
of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic retinopathy and
several heart diseases (reviewed in [1]). Angiogenin
(ANG), a potent in vivo inducer of angiogenesis, was first
isolated in a systematic search for angiogenic factors
secreted by human HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells
[2]. Its increased expression was subsequently documented in different tumors and in several instances correlated with the disease progression and aggressiveness
(reviewed in [3]). The use of antibodies [4-7], antisense
targeting [8] and inhibitors [9,10] has proven useful in
inhibiting the establishment, progression and metastasis
of tumors in mouse models, thereby establishing ANG as
a promising target for anticancer therapy. Furthermore,
ANG was shown to have in vitro antimicrobial [11] and
antiviral [12] effects, raising the possibility of its implication in the innate immune system. Recently, ANG mutations were described in amyotrophic lateral patients [13],
constituting the second angiogenic factor implicated in
this disease [14].
The human ANG gene comprises a single exon flanked by
small UTRs and codes for a 14 kDa polypeptide. The protein is synthesized with a 24 amino acid signal peptide
that is cleaved to produce a mature form with 123 amino
acids. Sequence analysis revealed its homology to the
Ribonuclease A (RNase A) superfamily, where it was
included and classified as RNase 5 [15,16]. ANG has three
main distinctive features when compared to the family
archetype bovine RNase A: (1) the characteristic ribonuclease activity towards poly-, di- and cyclic nucleotides is
104-106 lower and its enzymatic specificity is also different
[17]; (2) the region between residues 58–70 appears to
constitute a 'cell-binding site', independent from the
active site [18,19], probably involved primarily in protein-protein interactions; and (3) the region 31–35 constitutes a nucleolar localization signal [20]. All of these
features are essential to the angiogenic activity as shown
by directed mutagenesis experiments [20-23].
The RNase superfamily has a highly dynamic evolutionary
history, in which ANG occupies an important position.
The fact that only ANG/RNase 5-like ribonucleases are
found in non-mammalian vertebrates has led to the
hypothesis that the RNase ancestral was structurally similar to ANG. This ancestral enzyme was most likely
involved in host-pathogen interactions and did not possess an angiogenic activity [24]. A gene expansion
occurred before the divergence between placental and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/167

marsupial mammals, followed by a process of differential
gene duplication and retention between different orders
of the placental mammals, which resulted in the present
inter-species diversity of the RNase superfamily [25].
Diversifying (positive) selection had a strong influence in
the RNase A superfamily evolutionary pathway: eosinophil RNases, EDN and ECP, are among the most rapidly evolving coding sequences in primates [26], as are the
paralogous rodent eosinophil associated ribonucleases
(EARs) [27]. ANG genes suffered a rapid expansion in
rodents [28] – 6 genes and 3 pseudogenes in the mouse
genome, 2 genes in the rat genome – as the result of positive selection and gene sorting. ANG was also previously
shown to be under the effect of diversifying selection in
primates [29,30]. All primate species analyzed thus far
possess a single gene for ANG except for Pygathrix nemaeus
(Asian Douc Langur), in which the ANG gene appears to
have pseudogenized [31].
In this work we assessed the impacts of positive selection
on the primate ANG gene using: (1) a gene level evaluation of the non-synonymous/synonymous ratio (dN/dS)
and (2) a protein level evaluation of radical changes in
amino acid properties. Several sites under positive selection were detected in the different functional regions of
ANG and the effects in its structure and function have
been analyzed.

Results and discussion
Phylogenetic analyses
Neighbor-Joining (NJ), maximum-likelihood (ML) and
Bayesian (BAY) tree reconstructions of the primate ANG
coding sequences (table 1) presented similar overall
topologies (figure 1). ML and BAY trees were topologically
identical, the main difference relatively to the NJ tree
being the unresolved Homo/Pan/Gorilla trichotomy and
the positioning of Miopithecus talapoin. Overall, tree topologies were mostly coherent with the accepted phylogeny
of primates. The small differences detected are not surprising since the gene tree does not necessarily reflect the species tree [32].
Positive selection analyses
We first analyzed primate ANG genes for signatures of
positive selection using PAML [33]. This software uses a
maximum-likelihood approach to determine the nonsynonymous to synonymous rate ratio (ω), also designated Ka/Ks or dN/dS, a widely used measure to detect
departures from neutrality as indicators of selective pressures on protein coding genes. A ω > 1 indicates positive
selection, whereas ω = 1 indicates neutrality and ω < 1 is
indicative of negative selection. Branch models, where ω
is permitted to vary between lineages, were first tested. The
simplest model (one ratio), a very strict model allowing a

a good support for positive selection in the primate ANG.

a ω ratio above one, but only the two-ratio model for the
branch including Papio hamadryas, Macaca mulatta and

Cercopithecus aethiops (figure 1) presented a significant
LRT. We then tested three nested pairs of site models that
allow ω variation between codons: one admitting no positive selection (restricting ω ≤ 1) and another admitting
positive selection (M1a vs. M2a, M7 vs. M8 and M8a vs.
M8). Both positive selection admitting models, M2a and
M8, presented a significantly better fit to the data than

their neutral counterparts M1a, M7 and M8a (table 2).
The slightly more conservative model M2 detected 41% of
sites under positive selection (ω = 3.10), whereas M8
detected 49% of sites under positive selection (ω = 2.88),
indicating with a high degree of confidence that the ANG
gene is under positive selection. These results were consistent across all the tree reconstruction methods used.
Posterior Bayesian analysis through a Bayes Empirical
Bayes (BEB) methodology [34] allowed the determination of several amino acid sites under positive selection.
M2 detected four sites with ω > 1 having a posterior probability (PP) above 0.95 and four above 0.99, while M8
detected nine sites above 0.95 and seven above 0.99.
Either of the models detected several other sites with a PP
above 0.9. Similar results were obtained across all tree
topologies, with the exception of site 52 that only had a
strong support in the NJ topology. Since M2a is more conservative and M8 more prone to false positives [35], we
adopted an empiric threshold to consider candidate sites
under positive selection: a PP above 0.95 for M8 and
simultaneously above 0.90 for M2. Fifteen sites were
above the defined threshold (table 3).

Some concerns have been raised over the reliability of particular sites inferred to be under positive selection using
PAML [36]. Further support for the PAML results was
obtained using a complementary protein level approach
implemented in TreeSAAP [37]. This program performs
ancestral sequence reconstruction to determine and categorize evolutionary changes in 30 amino acid properties.
The number of radical changes per site was used as an
indicator of positive selection. An empirical threshold of
six properties with radical changes was adopted to further
support previous candidate sites. Most of the 15 PAML
sites had radical amino acid changes, which in five cases
had a number of properties above the defined threshold
(n ≥ 6) (table 3). Site 66 had the highest number of properties under selection (n = 16). In order to facilitate posterior analyses, a categorization was introduced: sites that
were above the defined threshold in TreeSAAP were designated as type I, whereas the remaining sites were designated as type II.
In order to assess if the sites under selection were only variant in angiogenin or throughout the whole RNase A
superfamily, the primate ANG sequences were compared
with a pool of 168 non-angiogenin RNase sequences

using the ConSurf web server [38]. This software calculates evolutionary conservation scores (1 to 9) based on
alignments and a reference structure (human ANG 3Dstructure) (figure 2). The sites under positive selection in
the primate sequences presented low conservation scores
of 1, except for site 52 that had a score of 3. Conservation
scores for sites 32, 34 and 52 were below the confidence
cut-off for ConSurf. When analyzed in the pool of RNase
sequences, sites 11, 84 and 103 presented a high conservation score of 7; whereas sites 4, 8, 51 and 34, 93 had
moderate conservation scores of 5 and 4, respectively. The
remaining sites had lower scores. It is striking that eight of
the 15 sites detected under selection in the primate ANG
gene, including three of the five type I sites, are highly or
moderately conserved in the RNase A family. Although
this might result in part from the structural and functional
divergence between the members of this family, it also
indicates that these sites are not subject to random variation throughout the family as a result of structural and
functional permissiveness on their locations.

The active site
RNase' A active sites can be divided in different subsites
corresponding to the binding sites of the phosphate (P0Pn), base (B0-Bn) and ribose (R0-Rn) moieties of each RNA
nucleotide (reviewed in [40]). The most important ones
are subsites: (1) P1, where scission of the P-O5' bond
occurs; (2) B1, where the 3' base binds and (3) B2 where
interaction with the 5' base occurs. Structural comparisons between RNase A and ANG have allowed the mapping and characterization of the different catalytic subsites
[41,42]. Only the P1 subsite (containing the catalytic triad
His-Lys-His) appears to be well conserved, the most striking structural differences residing in the B1 subsite that
appears to be blocked by Gln117 and partly by Phe120.

Structure-function analyses
To envisage possible structure-function implications of
positive selected sites in the ANG gene, the candidate sites
were mapped on the ANG X-ray structure (figure 3). Sites
clustered in particular regions of the protein structure, a
good indication of a non-random event. Four of the five
positive selection clusters were located within known
ANG functional regions: clusters 1 and 2 in the active site
region, cluster 3 in the nuclear location signal and cluster
4 in the 'cell-binding' site. Interestingly, positive selection
appears to act in all ANG's regions currently deemed

As expected due to functional constraints, no evidence for
positive selection was detected in amino acids with
important roles to the P1, B1 or B2 catalytic subsites. Cluster-1 of positive selected sites under positive selection was
located in the subsite P2 region, and included type I site, 4
(Ser) and three type II sites: 7 (Thr), 8 (His) and 11 (Thr).
These sites were all located within the first ANG α-helix,
neighboring several conserved important amino acids.
Site 4 presented the greatest diversity of drastic changes in
chemical and structural properties, linked to polarity,
hydrophobicity, bulkiness and structural conformation. A

essential for its angiogenic function. In order to obtain
further insights into the structural variations of these
regions, homology 3D-structure models were produced
for all the ancestral and current ANG sequences, using
SWISS-MODEL/Deep-view [39].

more reduced diversity was obtained for site 7 mostly
reflecting chemical changes, whereas sites 8 and 11 had
few and mostly conformational properties under positive
selection.
Interestingly, cluster-1 presented a proline in site 4 for two
of the primate species analyzed, Colobus guereza and
Macaca mulatta (figure 4). This amino acid may cause the
kinking of α-helices (reviewed in [43]) thereby affecting
the local structure of this region. To further evaluate the
effects of these substitutions, we compared the 3D-structure models for these two species with the 3D-strucutre
model inferred for the most recent common ancestral of
these, superimposing the protein backbones (figure 5).
Macaca mulatta ANG presented a significant backbone distortion that was not so pronounced in Colobus guereza
ANG. The overall structure of this region does not appear
to be significantly affected, given the good positional
overlap between the side chains of critical amino acids
like neighboring Arg5 and also Phe9 and His13. The location of site 4 at the beginning of the helix is perhaps allowing some distortion without significantly affecting the
position of critical amino acids.

Cluster-2 included four selected sites, type I sites 41 (Asp)
and 84 (His), type II sites 82 (Lys) and 93 (Gln), located
close or within the anti-parallel β-sheet formed by βstrands B1, B4 and B5. Sites 41 and 82 lie at the C-terminal region of the active site, while sites 84 and 93 are
located further up, facing the exterior of the protein. Site
41, neighboring two important active site residues Lys40
[P1 subsite] and Ile42 [B1 subsite] (table 4), presented a
total of seven amino acid properties suffering drastic
changes, namely properties pertaining polarity and size/
molecular weight. As for site 82, located close to another
residue of the B1 subsite Thr80, four properties were
detected concerning mostly the acid-base characteristics
and the buriedness of the residue. The second site under
positive selection in strand B4, site 84, presented a total of
six properties under selection related with polarity, acidbase properties and conformational properties. Finally,
site 93 (located between two important structural sites
Cys92 and Tyr94; table 4) had a total of five properties
detected pertaining to acid-base, size and conformationrelated characteristics.

trace with the relevant side chains visible. Each amino acid is numbered in colors according to the site category: type I sites are
numbered in red and type II in pink; other sites are shown in black.

Overall, the results for the two clusters located in the
active site region suggest that selective forces act in several
of the more permissive sites of subsites P2 and B1, shaping
the local chemical and conformational environment
without significantly interfering with the position critical
residues, which are probably subject to purifying selection.
The nucleolar targeting sequence
The nucleolar import of ANG was mapped in the position
31RRRGL35 [20], a region encompassing the c-terminal
region of helix H2 and the beginning of loop L2. ANG
import was further shown to be independent of the classic
nuclear localization signal-importin α/β pathway with a
proposed mechanism involving import through passive
diffusion and retention in the nucleus/nucleolus mediated by the NTS region [44].

Cluster-3 of sites under positive selection is located in this
region with a type I site 34 (Gly) and a type II site 32 (Arg).
Analysis of drastic changes in amino acid properties for
site 32 resulted in a total of five properties indicative of
changes in polarity and helical conformation. Site 34 had
an elevated number of drastic changes in properties as a
result of the broad diversity of amino acid substitutions
(figure 4). The chemical and structural divergence
observed for these two sites will surely influence the interactions with other proteins mediated through this region.

However, further clarification of the pathway for nuclear
import or retention and the amino acid sites involved in
both partners would be required in order to fully assess
the impact and possible causes for positive selection in
this region.
The cell-binding site
A putative 'cell-binding' site was first mapped to the
region between residues 60 and 68, as the proteolytic
cleavage of peptide bonds 60/61, 67/68 or both, abolished the angiogenic activity without significantly affecting the enzymatic activity [18]. Mutation of Arg66 [45]
and the substitution of ANG residues 58–70 for their
RNase counterparts produced similar results. Deamination experiments pointed out a second important residue,
Asn61, and also a possible second region containing
Asn109 [19]. The 'cell-binding' site was implicated in the
binding to α-actin [46,47], in particular residues Asn61
and Gly62, conserved in angiogenins [48]. However, the
interacting region remains elusive in other identified
interacting proteins as a putative 170 kDa receptor [49] or
α-2-actinin [50].

Cluster-4 of sites under positive selection partly overlaps
with the cell-binding site, including two type I sites: 63
(Asn) and Arg66 and a type II site: Val103. For the first of
these sites, a total of nine properties were subjected to
drastic changes: four chemical properties, four structural

properties and one uncategorized property. These are
mostly related to polarity and volume/spatial occupation.
Site 66 presented the highest number of properties subject
to drastic changes in this analysis with a total of 16 out of
31 properties – nine chemical and seven structural. Overall, the evolutionary changes observed for sites 63 and 66
influence the interactions performed by this region. However, further information about the interactions between
this region of ANG and other proteins would be required
in order to further evaluate the effects of positive selection
in this region.
Site 103 (Val) is a buried residue, but was also included in
this cluster, since its α-carbon is relatively close to sites 63
and 66 (93–63: 10.84 Å; 93–66: 12.84 Å; 63–66:9.98 Å).
This site is part of the hydrophobic core of the enzyme
(table 4) and only one structural property was detected.
The observed amino acid changes (figure 4) were replacements between branched-chain amino acids, conservative
in terms of hydrophobicity.
Clusters outside know functional regions
Cluster-5 had two type II sites, 51 (Arg) and 52 (Ser),
located in helix 3 outside of the main functional regions.
The support for site 52 as being under selection was weak,
only obtained with the NJ topology in PAML. As for site
51 no particular functional or structural information was
available, besides being a rather flexible residue (table 4)
that is exposed to the solvent. It has a total of five properties with drastic changes, mostly concerning acid-base and
conformational characteristics.
Driving forces for diversifying selection
Previous work by Zhang and Rosenberg [29] had reported
positive selection in the primate ANG gene and analyzed
its effects in terms of charge-altering substitutions. In this
study we present a more extensive analysis at the gene and
protein level and obtain evidence for positive selection in
all the ANG regions considered essential for angiogenesis,
a good indication that this is the main underlying process
for diversifying selection in this gene. However, it remains
elusive on whether it is physiological or pathological angiogenesis that drives ANG evolution.

Two events are generally used as reference for physiologic
and pathologic angiogenesis: placentation and cancer. All
the primate groups analyzed in this study have hemochorial placentas, the most invasive form of placentation,
where a direct contact between the placental and maternal
circulations is established. Expression studies are only
available for human placentas and indicate significant
increases in the ANG levels in last trimester placentas, correlating well with the dramatic increase in placental vessel
density and in fetal growth that occurs in this period [51].
Further ANG expression studies on other primate placen-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/167

tas, in particular those of lemurs and lorises that have
non-invasive epithelichorial placentation could help to
evaluate the existence of a connection between ANG levels, placentation type and positive selection on this gene.
Even if such a connection is established, the apparent
increasing gradient of placentation invasiveness over the
primate phylogeny must be seen with caution, given that
studies on mammalian placenta evolution [52,53] have
shown that the Eurtherian ancestral already had a deeply
invasive placenta and that the different forms of placentation currently observed were the result of clade-specific or
convergent evolution.
As for cancer, the overexpression of ANG has been documented in many tumors and appears to correlate well
with disease establishment, progression and in some cases
aggressiveness (reviewed in [3]). Many authors suggest
that tumor cells might increase ANG (and other angiogenic factors) expression to guarantee the blood supply
of the growing tumor, however, there is little information
on the genetic changes underlying this overexpression and
mutations in the ANG gene predisposing to cancer are
unknown.
It is noteworthy that invasive placentation and cancer progression share many features, like the invasive cell phenotype, vessel reorganization and neovascularization at the
site of implantation. Therefore, any evolutionary changes
that impact placentation are likely to have implications in
cancer. Previously, Zhang and Rosenberg [29] suggested,
based on the importance of ANG in pregnancy to embryo
vascularization, that diversifying selection could result
from an evolutionary 'conflict of interests' between mothers and fetuses. The same authors also compared ANG
evolution to another cancer-related protein under positive
selection BRCA1 [54], and suggested that the selective
pressures acting in these genes were more likely related
with the physiological functions of their encoded proteins
and not with cancer. The hypothesis of evolutionary conflict was recently analyzed by Crespi and Summers in relation to cancer [55]. These authors suggested that the
particular incidence of positive selection in cancer-related
genes is motivated by the strong ongoing selection generated by evolutionary conflict (antagonistic coevolution).
This hypothesis is based on the fact that the physiological
processes that involve antagonistic coevolution, like
resource acquisition and use, cellular replication and tissue growth are also critical to cancer predisposition. The
strong selection due to antagonistic coevolution would
drive the changes in conflict-related genes, and the pleiotropic effects of these changes would increase cancer risk.
The association between ANG mutations and disease has
only recently been observed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients [13], mostly from Irish and Scottish

descent. Seven different mutations where described in 15
individuals with both sporadic and familial forms of the
disease. These affected mostly conserved amino acids of
functional or structural importance like Arg31Lys(NLS),
Cys39Trp (S-S bond) or catalytic Lys40Ile (table 4), that
should result in moderate or severe impairment of ANG
function and therefore did not coincide with any of the
sites found to be under positive selection. The implication
of ANG in this disease is still obscure, given that these
mutations are rare, inexistent in other populations [56]
and, in fact, a moderate increase in ANG expression has
been documented in ALS patients [57].

exterior of the protein and can a priori modulate the interactions with other proteins or ligands. It is also noteworthy that some of the sites detected under positive selection
in this study were found to be involved in contacts with
the ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) in the crystal structure of
the ANG-RI complex (table 4). Furthermore, ANG has
been shown to stimulate rRNA production [60], possibly
mediated by binding to a specific rDNA non-transcribed
sequence [61]. More precise structural characterizations of
the interactions performed by ANG and its partners are
still lacking and will be essential to further assess which
are the critical amino acids and regions of the protein.

Although angiogenesis appears to take centre stage as a
driving force for positive selection in the ANG gene, it is
still possible that there are other processes contributing to
selective pressures. Several lines of evidence have accumulated supporting the existence of other ANG functions: (i)
the expression of ANG mRNA is low in the developing
fetus, reaching maximum levels in the adult, a pattern not
temporarily related to vessel development [58] and has a
widespread pattern of expression in many human cell
types [59]; (ii) ANG is a component of normal serum that
is upregulated in acute phase responses, suggesting an
involvement in host injury response [7]; (iii) human ANG
antimicrobial activity was also demonstrated in vitro
[11,12], but it is still elusive whether this is a result of the
ribonucleolytic activity or some other effect. The possible
ANG involvement in injury response and innate immunity constitutes another intriguing hypothesis for a selection driving force. The constant "arms-race" between host
and pathogens is a well known for maintaining a strong
selective pressure in immunity-related genes. A similar
possibility was raised in the mouse [24], whose six paralogous ANG genes were shown to be under positive selection, two of which presenting an antimicrobial activity
(ANG1 and ANG4). The role of ANG4 in gut innate
immunity was characterized in vivo [11]. Further characterization of human/primate ANG anti-microbial effects
is required in order to assess this hypothesis. Nonetheless,
this is yet another possibility that is compatible with the
theory of evolutionary conflict.

Conclusion

Finally, it is also important to consider the role that interacting proteins and ligands may have in the evolution of
ANG. We evaluated the solvent exposure of the residues
detected to be under positive selection by analyzing the
accessible surface area (ASA) using GETAREA (figure 6).
This program estimates if a residue is exposed at the surface or buried in the protein, based on the ratio between
side-chain ASA and the "random coil" values per residue.
Eleven of the fifteen sites presented an ASA ratio equal or
above 50% (7, 8, 32, 34, 41, 51, 63, 66, 84, and 93), three
above 40% (4, 11, and 52) and only one bellow 20%
(103). The majority of the sites is therefore exposed to the

In this work we aimed at evaluating in detail the amino
acid sites under positive selection in the primate ANG
gene, including its possible structural and functional
impacts. Using a maximum-likelihood gene level analysis
we obtained evidence for positive selection on the ANG
gene. Posterior site specific analyses allowed the identification of 15 sites with strong evidence of positive selection, further corroborated by a protein level analysis that
showed that five of these sites also had an elevated
number of amino acid properties suffering radical
changes. The mapping of these sites in the ANG 3D-structure revealed five clusters in specific regions within the
main functional regions of the protein. In the active site
region, positive selection appears to modulate the chemical and structural characteristics of a few permissive sites
without affecting the position of the critical residues. Significant chemical and structural divergence is further
observed in two other regions, the nucleolar location signal and 'cell-binding' site, clearly having a potential to
influence the interactions performed through them.
Given that evidence of positive selection was detected in
all ANG functional regions required for angiogenesis, it is
tempting to indicate angiogenesis as the process underlying selection. It is unclear, however, if it is physiologic or
pathologic involvement of ANG in angiogenesis that dictates the selective pressures. The two prototypical situations, placentation and cancer, share common features in
the primate species analyzed and the hypothesis of selective pressures motivated by antagonistic coevolution
appears to set a common ground explanation on how the
evolutionary changes motivated by physiologic processes
involving ANG can lead to an increased risk of cancer.
However, other processes may also influence ANG's adaptative evolution, and the possible involvement in innate
immunity is particularly interesting since the host-pathogen 'arms-race' is a common origin for selective pressure.
Also, one must consider the possibility of ANG/ligands
co-evolution given that most sites under selection are
exposed in the surface of the protein and can mediate
interactions. Future experimental characterizations of

will allow further evaluation of these hypotheses.

Methods
Sequence data
ANG coding sequences were retrieved from GenBank for
14 different species representative of the two main
branches of the simian primates: Platyrrhini (new world
monkeys) and Catarrhini (old world monkeys and hominids). Reference sequences were available for Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes, the remaining primate sequences
had been previously published [29,31] (see table 1 for
species and sequence reference numbers). In all alignment
and figures the names of the species were abbreviated as
the genus plus the first initial of the specific epithet and
the human amino acid sequence was used as reference for
sites.

Sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees
A protein based coding sequence alignment was constructed by aligning translated protein sequences using
the Clustal W algorithm [62] with default settings, in
MEGA version 3.1 [63] and retrieving the corresponding
DNA sequence. The alignment was straightforward, with
the introduction of a single 3 bp gap corresponding to an
insertion of an arginine residue in the Hominid lineage.
Gaps were removed from analyses. Phylogenetic trees
were constructed using three distinct algorithms: neighbor-joining (NJ) [64] with 1,000 bootstrap replicates [65]
in MEGA version 3.1; Maximum likelihood (ML) in Paup
4.0b10 [66] using PaupUp graphical interface [67] and
Bayesian analysis (BY) in MrBayes 3.1.2 [68]. For ML the
best substitution model was evaluated using Modeltest
3.7 [69] that determined SYM + G as the best-fit model,
according to Akaike's information criterion (AIC). The
best phylogenetic tree was determined using heuristic
search with nearest-neighbor interchange (NNI) and
nodes support was evaluated by bootstrapping with 1,000

Page 13 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:167

replicates. For Bayesian analysis the best substitution
model was evaluated through MrModelTest v2.2 [70], a
modified version of David Posada's Modeltest 3.6 rewritten to compare all of the 24 models that can be implemented in MrBayes version 3, which also selected SYM+G
as the best-fit model (AIC).
Evolutionary analyses
Alignments and the NJ/ML/BY trees were used for posterior molecular evolution analyses. Evidence for positive
selection on ANG was first evaluated using likelihood
ratio tests using the CODEML algorithm of the PAML
3.14b package [33]. We tested Branch models, the most
simple (one ratio) of which admits a single ω ratio for the
entire tree and the most general (free-ratios) which allows
a ω ratio for each branch. We also tested two ratios models
allowing a background ω ratio and a different ω for the
branch being tested, done for all the branches presenting
a ω > 1 in the free-ratios models. As null hypothesis we
used the one ratios model and two ratios models with a
fixed ω = 1 in the branch under analysis. The level of significance for these LRTs was calculated using a chi-square
approximation given that twice the difference of log likelihood between the models (2∆lnL) will asymptotically
have a χ2 distribution, with a number of degrees of freedom corresponding to the difference of parameters
between the nested models. We then used site models that
compare the fit of two nested site specific models to the
data – a neutral model that does not admit positive selection (ω < = 1) and a more general, alternative model that
admits positive selection (ω > 1). The one ratio model
(M0) and three pairs of site specific models were used, as
suggested in the PAML user's guide: M1a (NearlyNeutral)
versus M2a (PositiveSelection); M7 (Beta) versus M8
(Beta&ω) and M8a (Beta&ωs = 1) versus M8 (Beta&ω).
The significance of the LRT between the neutral and alternative model was assessed as described before and due to
possible complications with non-estimable parameters,
the following degrees of freedom were used, as they are
expected to be conservative [58]: M1a vs. M2a df = 2; M7
vs. M8 df = 2; M8a vs. M8 df = 1. Similar results were
obtained for all methods of tree reconstruction, reflecting
the robustness of PAML in respect to the phylogenetic tree
used.

A protein level analysis was performed using TreeSAAP
3.2 [37]. This program calculates the goodness-of-fit
between an observed distribution of changes in amino
acid physiochemical properties and an expected distribution that each amino acid replacement is equally likely
under selective neutrality. These are analyzed based on the
ancestral reconstruction inferred from the coding
sequence alignment and corresponding phylogenetic tree
using the CODEML algorithm. The program categorizes
the range of changes in amino acid properties in eight

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/167

magnitude categories from conservative to radical and calculates a z-score that indicates the direction of selection.
We chose to monitor positive radical variations (+6, +7
and +8. magnitudes) as they are expected to result in significant structural and functional changes on the protein,
thereby correlating with molecular adaptation and positive selection [71,72]. The number of properties under
positive selection per site was determined by summing the
number of unique properties in these magnitude categories per branch. All the 31 properties in TreeSAAP were
used and, in order to facilitate functional analyses, categorized in three groups: chemical, structural and others (see
additional file 3). Codon numbering is according to the
coding sequence alignment. Amino acid numbering is
according the coding sequence numbering minus the 24
amino acids of the signal peptide.
The conservation of the sites detected under selection in
the RNase A family was tested using the ConSurf web
server [38]. This program calculates conservation scores
for sites in a protein, based on a sequence alignment and
phylogenetic trees, through an empirical Bayesian
approach. Clustal-W alignments of the 14 primates
sequences used in this study and a pool of 168 non-angiogenin RNase sequences (obtained by 6 psi-blast iterations using the Homo sapiens sequence as query) were
submitted to the server. The 2ANG pdb file was used as
reference and the phylogenetic tree was the one generated
by ConSurf. Confidence intervals for the conservation
scores estimations are calculated and when the number of
sequences is small, the confidence interval tends to be
large. Amino acid positions that are assigned confidence
intervals that are too large are considered to be below the
confidence cut-off. This was the case for sites 32, 34 and
52 in the primate ANG alignment.
Structural analysis and homology modeling
The main functional regions and sites under positive
selection were mapped on the X-ray crystallographic structure of Human ANG, retrieved from the Protein Databank
as 2ANG [40]. Visualization and editing of the structure
were performed using pyMOL (DeLano Scientific, San
Carlos, CA, USA). Homology modeling was performed
for ancestral and current sequences, whereas the ancestral
sequences were reconstructed using PAML [33]. 2ANG
was used as template for Swiss-model [39] using the
project mode in DeepView/Swiss-pdb viewer. Briefly, the
pdb x-ray coordinates file 2ANG (without waters and heteroatoms) and the sequence to model were loaded in
DeepView and the resulting alignment manually corrected. This project was then submitted to the SwissModel server for automated model generation and energy
minimization, thereby creating the final optimized
model. The model quality was assessed by What-Check
[73] through Swiss-Model. Furthermore, given the high

degree of homology between sequences, the quality of the
models is expected to be high and depending mostly on
the quality of the alignment [74].
The surface exposure of amino acids was assessed using
GETAREA 1.1 [75] web interface. This program performs
analytical calculation of solvent accessible surface area
based on the atom coordinates of a PDB file and provides
an estimate of the solvent exposure based on the ratio of
the side-chain surface area to "random coil" value per residue. The "random coil" value of a residue × is the average
solvent-accessible surface area of × in the tripeptide Gly-XGly in an ensemble of 30 random conformations. Residues are considered to be solvent exposed if the ratio
value exceeds 50% and to be buried if the ratio is less than
20%
