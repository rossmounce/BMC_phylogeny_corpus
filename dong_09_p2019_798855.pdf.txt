Background
High rates of mutation in HIV infected individual allow
the virus to adapt rapidly in vivo to selective forces such as
anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and host immune pressure.
This provides an opportunity to determine the relative
contribution of different components of the immune
response to HIV-1 infection in driving viral diversity,
which may also facilitate assessment of their role in controlling viral replication. It is accepted that HIV-1-specific
cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) may drive the selection of
viral variants that can escape T-cell recognition but the
extent of this selective pressure has been controversial.

32.63% (232/711) of the mutations in the gag, pol and
nef genes leading to amino acid substitutions were associated with class I HLA molecules: of these, 27.16% (63/
232) were found within or close to known CD8+ T-cell
epitopes.

Conclusion
Taken together our data confirm that CD8+ T-cell pressure
has a major impact on HIV-1 viral diversity and represent
an important element of viral control in the infected host.

Methods
Two digit HLA typing; ELISPOT assay; HIV-1 sequence
analysis; HIV sequence clustering and phylogenetic analysis of HLA associations using the neighbour-joining
method, S-Plus 8.0, ''Partitioning around medoids''
(PAM) method and Stratification analysis by MantelHaenszel tests.

Results
Here we describe the consequences of HLA-associated
selection on viral diversity in the main targets of T-cell recognition following an outbreak of HIV-1 in a cohort of
258 former plasma donors in rural China. The surprising
finding that all the donors appear to have been infected
with the same strain of clade B HIV-1 ensured that the
analysis was not confounded by ''founder effect''. At least
