Abstract

In all three superkingdoms of life, DNA is packaged into compact structures by proteins [1]. While there are some general
similarities in the organization of the chromosomal DNA-

protein complexes in all three superkingdoms, there are radical differences in the proteins that are actually involved in
DNA-packaging. In bacteria, the proteins of the Hu/IHF family are the dominant chromosomal proteins and they assume

Conclusions: The Alba superfamily proteins appear to have originated as RNA-binding proteins
which formed various ribonucleoprotein complexes, probably including RNase P. It was recruited
as a chromosomal protein possibly only within the crenarchaeal lineage. The evolutionary
connections reported here suggest how a diversity of functions based on a common biochemical
basis emerged in proteins of the Alba superfamily.

refereed research

Results: Using sequence-profile searches, we were able to unify the Alba proteins with RNase P/
MRP subunit Rpp20/Pop7, human RNase P subunit Rpp25, and the ciliate Mdp2 protein, which is
implicated in macronuclear development. The Alba superfamily contains two eukaryote-specific
families and one archaeal family. We present different lines of evidence to show that both
eukaryotic families perform functions related to RNA metabolism. Several members of one of the
eukaryotic families, typified by Mdp2, are combined in the same polypeptide with RNA-binding
RGG repeats. We also investigated the relationships of the unified Alba superfamily within the
ancient RNA-binding IF3-C fold, and show that it is most closely related to other RNA-binding
members of this fold, such as the YhbY and IF3-C superfamilies. Based on phyletic patterns and the
principle of phylogenetic bracketing, we predict that at least some of the archaeal members may
also possess a role in RNA metabolism.

Background: There is considerable heterogeneity in the phyletic patterns of major chromosomal
DNA-binding proteins in archaea. Alba is a well-characterized chromosomal protein from the
crenarchaeal genus Sulfolobus. While Alba has been detected in most archaea and some eukaryotic
taxa, its exact functions in these taxa are not clear. Here we use comparative genomics and
sequence profile analysis to predict potential alternative functions of the Alba proteins.

a distinctive three-dimensional fold with long β-sheets, which
has thus far not been encountered in any other proteins [2].
In euryarchaea and the eukaryotes, proteins containing the αhelical histone fold are the predominant DNA-packaging
components of chromatin. Four or eight copies of the histone
fold domain oligomerize to form higher-order structures such
as the tetrasome and the octamer, which act as the principal
protein units of chromatin in eukaryotes and some archaea
[3-5]. The crenarchaea lack histones, but an alternative chromosomal protein, Sul7d, which contains a fold similar to the
chromodomain of eukaryotic chromosomal proteins, has
been characterized in the crenarchaeal genus Sulfolobus
[6,7]. However, homologs of this protein are not known from
other crenarchaeal genera, suggesting that the dominant
chromosomal protein of the crenarchaea may be vary
between different genera.
More recently, a novel chromosomal protein, termed Alba,
has been characterized in Sulfolobus, and was shown to coat
DNA densely without compacting it [8-10]. It was demonstrated that Alba is acetylated on a lysine residue and
deacetylated by Sir2, in a manner reminiscent of the
deacetylation of the eukaryotic chromosomal proteins [8,11].
Structural studies on Alba showed that it shared a common
fold with the DNase I and the carboxy-terminal domain of the
translation initiation factor IF3 [12], suggesting its origin
within a group of ancient nucleic acid-binding domains.
Homologs of Alba were also detected in most other archaea
and certain eukaryotes [10,12] suggesting that it was an
ancient protein that originated prior to the divergence of the
conserved genomic cores of the eukaryotes, crenarchaea and
euryarchaea from their common ancestor. The Alba homolog
from the euryarchaeon, Thermococcus zilligi, is depleted in
stationary phase along with the histones, but it is not known
if it physically associates with chromatin in this organism
[13]. While Alba is a dominant chromosomal protein in certain crenarchaea, studies on the chromatin of eukaryotes and
euryarchaea have not detected the Alba homologs as major
constituents of chromosomes in these lineages [5,14]. This
suggests that the highly-conserved Alba homologs, especially
those from organisms where there is no evidence for a major
chromosomal role, may have additional, as yet undiscovered,
functions.
In this work, we investigate the evolutionary history and the
functions of Alba homologs using comparative genomics and
sequence profile analysis. As a result of our analysis, we were
able to unify the Alba proteins with conserved protein subunits of eukaryotic RNase P and RNase MRP. We also show
that the Alba proteins are derived within the ancient RNAbinding IF3-C fold and are probably closest to the YhbY
superfamily of proteins, which is also involved in RNA metabolism. We present evidence that the Alba superfamily probably originated as an RNA-binding protein which formed
complexes with various small RNAs, and was recruited as a
chromosomal protein only, perhaps, within the crenarchaeal

lineage. This evolutionary connection with proteins involved
in ribonucleoprotein metabolism also throws light on the
potential functions of the eukaryotic members of the Alba
family.

Results and discussion
Characterization of the Alba superfamily and its
relatives
To gain a better understanding of the functional diversity and
provenance of the Alba protein, we initiated sequence profile
searches using the PSI-BLAST program (e-value threshold for
inclusion in profile was set at 0.01 for each iteration) and various archaeal homologs of the Sulfolobus solfataricus Alba
(gi: 15897841). In the initial iterations, these searches recovered homologs from nearly all archaeal genera with completely-sequenced genomes, except Halobacterium and
Methanosarcina, as well as multiple homologs from the
eukaryotes such as Kinetoplastids (Leishmania), Apicomplexans (Plasmodium), plants (Arabidopsis and rice) and animals. The searches also recovered the conserved Rpp20p/
Pop7p proteins from various eukaryotes: for example, the
human Pop7 was recovered in the iteration 6 with an e-value
= 10-5 in a search initiated with the Archaeoglobus protein
AF1956. The Pop7/Rpp20 proteins have been demonstrated
to function as subunits of two closely-related ribonucleoprotein complexes, namely RNase P and RNase MRP, which
process tRNA and rRNA, respectively, in vertebrates and
fungi [15-17]. Furthermore, the searches recovered a second
subunit of RNase P, namely Rpp25, from vertebrates [18], as
well as the RPP25-related protein Mdp2 from the ciliate Stylonychia lemnae, which has been shown to participate in the
process of macronuclear development [19]. Reciprocal PSIBLAST searches, seeded with various new members that were
detected in these searches, detected the archaeal Alba proteins with significant e-values and recovered approximately
the same set of proteins. For example, a search initiated with
human Rpp25 (gi: 12803357) recovered the archaeal Alba
orthologs with significant e-values (e = 10-4-10-7, iteration 23). The pairwise alignment in each of these cases spanned the
entire length of the minimal archaeal Alba protein, which has
been shown to comprise a single domain [12]. These observations suggested that all these proteins from diverse organisms, including the RNase P/MRP subunits Pop7/Rpp20 and
Rpp25, Mdp2 and Alba define an evolutionarily-related
superfamily of protein domains. Hereinafter, we refer to this
superfamily of domains as the Alba superfamily. Whilst most
of the eukaryotic proteins detected in these searches are
larger than the archaeal Alba proteins, analysis of their composition using the SEG program suggests that the Alba
domain of approximately 95 residues is the only globular
domain in these larger homologs.
When the multiple alignment of the Alba superfamily is
superimposed on the Sulfolobus solfataricus Alba crystal
structure (PDB: 1h0x), a number of defining features that are

inserts of variable lengths. The majority of archaeal members
of the superfamily are clearly distinguished by certain
sequence motifs, such as a GXKP signature in the loop
between strand-1 and helix-1 and the [KR]AVD signature in
helix-2 (in the single-letter amino-acid code). Several eukaryotic and few archaeal members lack the lysine (K16), which is

characteristic pattern of charged or polar residues associated
with the strand-2 and the helix-2 of the domain (Figure 1).
Both the eukaryotic and archaeal Alba domains possess a positive charge density of about 15-16% and share several fairly
conserved charged positions (Figure 1). The region between
the peculiarly elongated strands 3 and 4 in the carboxy-terminal hairpin is fairly variable: some members of the family

Multiple sequence alignment of the Alba family was constructed using the T-Coffee program after parsing high-scoring pairs from PSI-BLAST search results.
The alignment of the Alba superfamily is superimposed on the structure-based alignments with members of the IF3-C and YhbY superfamilies. The
secondary structure, derived from the representatives of these superfamilies with available structures, is shown above the alignment, with E representing
a β strand and H an α-helix. The box shows the shared loop, which is typically bounded by small residues in Alba and YhbY. The 95% consensus shown
below each family was derived using the following amino acid classes: hydrophobic (h: ALICVMYFW, yellow shading) and their aliphatic subset (l: ILV,
yellow shading); aromatic (a: FHWY, yellow shading); small (s: ACDGNPSTV, green) and their tiny subset (u: GAS, green shading); charged (c: DEHKR,
pink) and their basic subset (+: HKR, pink) and acidic subset (-: DE, pink); and polar (p: CDEHKNQRST, blue) and their alcoholic subset (o: ST, blue). A
'G', 'K' or 'E' shows the completely conserved amino acid in that group. The position corresponding to the lysine, which is acetylated in Alba, is shown in
red. The limits of the domains are indicated by the residue positions, on each end of the sequence. The 'R' to the right of the sequence denotes those
members that have the RNA-binding 'RGG' repeats at the C terminus. The numbers within the alignment are non-conserved inserts that have not been
shown. The sequences are denoted by their gene name followed by the species abbreviation and GeneBank Identifier. Species abbreviations are as follows:

suggesting that this modification does not have a universal
role in regulating the functions of this family. The residues
associated with the dimer interface are also fairly well conserved throughout the superfamily implying a conserved
dimeric quaternary structure. On the whole, despite differences between the various groups of the Alba family, the high
overall conservation, similar charge densities and similar
length of the cores of the secondary structure elements suggest that the basic biochemical properties are likely to be conserved throughout this superfamily.
To understand further the evolutionary relationships within
the Alba superfamily, we constructed phylogenetic trees with
the alignment of the Alba domain, using the neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood and Bayesian posterior probabilities methods. This phylogenetic analysis consistently
revealed the presence of two major eukaryotic families and
one archaeal family within the Alba superfamily (Figure 2a).
Within the archaeal Alba family there appear to have been lineage-specific duplications in Methanopyrus, Sulfolobus, Aeropyrum and Archaeoglobus, but it is not clear whether this
represents functional redundancy or specialization. One of
the eukaryotic families contains Pop7/Rpp20 orthologs from
yeasts, vertebrates, insects and Caenorhabditis elegans and
related proteins from plants and protists such as Leishmania
and Plasmodium. Based on the preferential grouping of the
above-mentioned plant and protist proteins with the animal
and fungal Pop7/Rpp20 proteins, we propose that these proteins are likely to possess the same function. Most members
of this eukaryotic family are typified by a synapomorphic carboxy-terminal extension with a FDxh signature (where h is a
hydrophobic residue, typically L; Figure 1).
The second eukaryotic family contains the ciliate Mdp2 protein, several animal proteins including RNase P subunit,
Rpp25 and uncharacterized proteins from plants and Plasmodium. These proteins are unified by a synapomorphic carboxy-terminal extension, which contains a characteristic
GYQXP signature. Several members of this family also have
long carboxy-terminal tails with repeats of the RGG motif

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/10/R64

(see below). Members of this family have been either lost
secondarily or diverged beyond recognition in the fungi and
the nematode C. elegans. This phyletic pattern may reflect a
certain degree of functional redundancy between the two
eukaryotic families of the Alba superfamily. The phyletic pattern and phylogenetic tree topology suggest that the Alba protein was present in the common ancestor of the eukaryotes
and archaea and subsequently duplicated in two paralogous
lineages, typified by Rpp20 and Mdp2/Rpp25, very early in
eukaryotic evolution. The average sequence divergence
within the eukaryotic families of the Alba superfamily (mean
p-distance = 0.75 for eukaryotic sequences; 0.73 within
Rpp20 family and 0.65 within Mdp2 family) was much higher
than that of the archaeal Alba family (mean p-distance =
0.45). While there could be a number of reasons for the accelerated divergence seen in eukaryotes, the functional
diversification of the RNase P complex into the related RNase
P and RNase MRP complexes, and a degree of relaxation of
constraints due to functional overlap between the two eukaryotic families, could be two of the plausible explanations.
As Alba is likely to have been present in the last common
ancestor of the eukaryotic and all archaeal lineages, we were
interested in investigating its deeper relationships with more
ancient proteins that could be traced back to the last universal
common ancestor (LUCA) of the extant superkingdoms of
life. Analysis of the structure of the Alba protein had shown
that it possessed the IF3 carboxy-terminal domain (IF3-C)
fold [12]. This fold is also present in DNase I [12], in the ribosomal protein S8, RNA 3'-terminal phosphate cyclase, R3H
[20], in the carboxy-terminal domain of archaeo-eukaryotic
prolyl tRNA synthetases (Pro-TRSC) [21] and in the RNA
binding proteins of the YhbY family (Figures 2b and 3). In our
earlier studies we had shown that the ancient RNA-binding
domain, the thiouridine synthase, methylase, pseudouridine
synthase (THUMP) domain, also belongs to this fold [22]. A
survey of the functions of the conserved superfamilies containing the IF3-C fold indicates that the predominant theme
is involvement in nucleic acid interactions, in particular RNA
metabolism (Figure 2c). Earlier, based on phyletic patterns

of the extant eukaryotes. The known or clearly predicted biochemical functions of the various superfamilies of this fold and their phyletic patterns have
been indicated along with their names. R stands for RNA binding and D for DNA binding. The '>' as in B>E in the phyletic patterns, indicates an ancient
transfer from bacteria to eukaryotes. The overall topology of the phylogram was derived using clustering based on DALI Z-scores, and specific shared
derived characters. The YhhP family was first identified and predicted to function as a redox regulator in reference [52]. The red lineages are those which
can be confidently traced to the LUCA, the black lineages are exclusively archaeo-eukaryotic and the green lineages are mainly bacterial with transfers to
eukaryotes.

and phylogenetic analysis, we had traced the RNA-binding
THUMP and S8 domains to LUCA [23]. The YhbY domain,
which is well conserved in bacteria, archaea and plants, has
been shown to be involved in intron splicing in plant chloroplasts [24-26]. It is physically associated with the ribosome in
bacteria and is encoded in an operon, along with ribosomal
proteins and RNase P subunits in archaea, suggesting an
ancient role in translation [24]. In phylogenetic trees of the
YhbY proteins, the archaeal and bacterial groups form distinct clusters which are clearly separated from each other by
a distinct branch (Figure 2b). Furthermore, the archaeal and
bacterial versions of YhbY are distinguished by specific
sequence motifs. The tree topology, conservation pattern and
function suggest that the YhbY domain was also likely to have
been present in the LUCA. Hence, at least three ancient members of the IF3-C fold which possess RNA-binding properties
potentially can be traced back to the point prior to the split
between the bacteria and the archaeo-eukaryotic lineages,
that is, the LUCA. These observations suggest that the ancestral version of the IF3-C fold is likely to have been an RNAbinding domain, which had already diversified into three distinct RNA-binding domains prior to the LUCA itself. Subsequently, Alba, the RNA 3'-terminal phosphate cyclase and
Pro-TRSC appear to have been derived at the base of the
archaeo-eukaryotic lineage, while IF3 and R3H were derived
at the base of the bacterial lineage (Figure 2c).
Clustering, based on pairwise-structural-alignment Z-scores
(obtained using the DALI program) and sequence similarity,
suggests that the closest relatives of the Alba superfamily are
IF3 and YhbY (Figures 2c and 3). Additionally, the YhbY and
Alba domains also resemble each other in occurring typically
in small (< 100 aa), single domain proteins, unlike IF3, R3H,
Pro-TRSC, S8, RNA 3'-terminal cyclase, THUMP and DNase
I amino-terminal domains, which occur in multidomain configurations. Furthermore, Alba and YhbY domains share a

Prediction of functional diversity within the Alba
superfamily
Only three sets of proteins of the Alba superfamily are experimentally characterized: Sulfolobus Alba, Rpp20 proteins
from yeast and vertebrates and the Rpp25 protein from vertebrates. The former has been shown to be the major chromosomal DNA-binding protein in the crenarchaeon Sulfolobus.
However, even in Sulfolobus, Alba coats DNA densely but
does not elicit significant compaction, suggesting that it is not
sufficient for chromatin organization and requires functional
partners, such as Sul7d [6]. Furthermore, at least in eukaryotes, even if Alba is a chromosomal protein it does appear to be
as abundant as some of the other proteins such as HMG I/Y,
HMG1 or related proteins [14]. Experimental studies on euryarchaeal chromatin have, so far, not yielded much evidence
for a major chromosomal role for Alba [5,8,27]. Hence, it is
conceivable that Alba was specifically recruited for a major
chromosomal function only in a particular lineage of
crenarchaea.
Rpp20/Pop7 from S. cerevisiae and humans has been demonstrated to be a shared, essential protein subunit common to
both RNase P and RNase MRP [15-17]. It is likely that other
members of the Rpp20 family, which are conserved widely
across the eukaryotic tree, perform a similar function in
RNase P. Human Rpp25, the only experimentally characterized member of the second eukaryotic family (Mdp2 family),
is also a RNase P subunit [18]. Several uncharacterized members of the Mdp2 family contain tripeptide RGG repeats carboxy-terminal to their globular Alba domain (Figure 1). RGG
repeats are found in a variety of eukaryotic ribonucleoproteins, such as nucleolin, FMRP and SAF-A and are known to
bind a variety of RNAs, including G quartet structures [2830]. As in the case of these eukaryotic Alba proteins, they
occur typically in conjunction with some other globular RNAbinding domain. Affinity of these repeats for RNA is modulated through the methylation of arginine in many RGG-box
proteins [31]. These observations suggest that, like Rpp25,
other members of the Mdp2 family could also function as a
RNase P/MRP subunit. The ciliate Mdp2, which is a member
of the second eukaryotic family, is exclusively co-expressed
along with Mdp1 and Mdp3 during macronuclear development [19]. The Mdp1 protein encodes a RNA binding protein
with the Piwi and PAZ domains, while Mdp3 encodes a β-propeller protein with the kelch repeats (L.A., unpublished
observations). The ciliate Piwi homologs, such as Mdp1, have
been proposed to bind small RNAs that direct the process of
DNA reorganization in macronucleus development, in a process related to gene silencing and repeat-induced mutagenesis
in fungi [19,32]. The exclusive co-expression of Mdp2 with

interactions

Using sensitive sequence profile analysis, we unify the
archaeal Alba proteins with the eukaryotic RNase P/MRP
subunits Pop7/Rpp20 and Rpp25, and the ciliate protein
Mdp2, which is involved in macronuclear development. The
Alba domain superfamily comprises three well-defined families, namely the archaeal family and two eukaryotic families,
typified by the Rpp20 and Mdp2 proteins, respectively. In
turn, the Alba domain is closely related to the RNA-binding
versions of the IF3-C fold such as YhbY and IF3-C. We
present data which suggest that the ancestral function of the
IF3-C fold was related to RNA interaction, and we present
evidence that both the eukaryotic lineages of the Alba superfamily are principally involved in RNA metabolism. In
addition to the RNase P complex, some of the Alba proteins
may form complexes with other RNAs and participate in
other regulatory processes, such as ciliate macronuclear
development. The high degree of conservation of Alba in the
archaea contrasts the poor conservation or mosaic phyletic
distribution of other chromosomal proteins such as Sul7d,
7KMK, HU, MC1 and histones. These observations, along
with the principle of phylogenetic bracketing, suggest that
Alba in archaea may additionally or, in some lineages, exclusively, possess a role in RNA metabolism. Thus, starting as an
ancestral RNA binding module, the Alba superfamily has colonized two functionally-distinct but biochemically similar
niches in RNA metabolism and chromatin structure. Experimental exploration of the observations and the functional
predictions reported here may help in improving our understanding of key processes in RNA metabolism.

information

The recruitment of RNA-binding domains for DNA-binding
roles in chromatin appears to have occurred on different
occasions in the course of eukaryotic evolution. A well-studied example of this process is provided by the HEH-fold
found in the SAP and LEM domains of eukaryotic chromatin
proteins. This fold is also present in proteins associated with
RNA metabolism, such as a domain of the lysyl-tRNA synthetase and the bacterial transcription terminator protein
Rho [35]. There is considerable diversity of chromosomal
proteins across the archaea, with no major type being universally conserved [6]. All known crenarchaea lack histones but
possess other proteins such as Alba or Sul7d, which is
restricted to Sulfolobus [6]. Several euryarchaea possess histones, but others, for example, Thermoplasma, lack them and
contain the bacterial-type HU protein instead [6]. Some

euryarchaea also possess a distinct chromosomal protein of
the MC1 family (incorporated into a multi-domain protein
with helicase and nuclease modules in some archaea), which
is also found in the PBCV virus [36,37]. Hence, it is conceivable that the archaea have explored a number of strategies for
DNA organization, with different strategies being selected by
different local, extreme niches. This diversity of chromosomal
proteins in archaea is consistent with a model where a conserved protein such as Alba, with an original function in RNA
metabolism, was recruited in some crenarchaea for chromatin-related functions. Interestingly, particular versions of
Sso10b from Sulfolobales [10] are considerably divergent
compared to all other archaeal Alba homologs (Figure 2a),
suggesting that they may have undergone divergence to perform exclusive roles in chromatin.

reviews

Thus, an ancestral role in RNA metabolism may be interpolated for both eukaryotic families of the Alba superfamily.
This is consistent with the ancient RNA-binding function of
the IF3-C fold, including the closest neighbors of Alba, such
as YhbY and IF3. The high degree of conservation of Alba in
both euryarchaea and crenarchaea is in contrast with the heterogeneity seen in the phyletic patterns of other major DNApackaging proteins within archaea (see below). Hence, based
on its conserved archaeo-eukaryotic phyletic pattern, which is
typical of several RNA-metabolism proteins [23], and by the
principle of phylogenetic bracketing (Figure 2c), we would
predict that most archaeal members of the Alba superfamily
could have an additional or exclusive role in RNA metabolism. Of the 10 proteins of the eukaryotic RNase P and RNase
MRP complexes that are conserved in eukaryotes, orthologs
of Rpp30, Rpp29, Rpp21 and Pop5 (has an additional paralog
Rpp14 in animals) are readily detectable in archaea [34].
Identification of the eukaryotic homologs of Alba as the subunits of RNase P/MRP implies that the archaeal Alba proteins
could function possibly as the primitive equivalent of the
Rpp20 and Rpp25 in the archaeal RNase P or a related ribonucleoprotein complex. This prediction is consistent with
both the phyletic pattern of Alba in archaea and the requirement of Rpp20 for viability in yeast. This is also consistent
with Alba retaining the basic ancestral RNA-binding property, after divergence from its functionally-related RNA-binding domains at the base of the archaeo-eukaryotic lineage. In
light of these predictions, it would be of interest to investigate
if the deacetylation of Alba by the Sir2 homologs might have
any relevance to RNA metabolism.

comment

Mdp1 suggests that the two may interact functionally with
each other. The above observations suggest that Mdp2 and
some of its relatives could potentially form other ribonucleoprotein complexes, which may perform functions in relation
to the small RNAs involved in ciliate DNA reorganization,
gene-silencing or allied processes. Members of the Mdp2
family are present in multiple copies in plants (Figure 2a) and
may correlate with a well-developed gene-silencing system in
this lineage [23,33].

iterated until convergence [38]. All large-scale sequence analysis procedures, such as determination of phyletic patterns,
were carried out using the SEALS package [39,40]. Multiple
alignments were constructed using the T-coffee program [41]
and corrected based on PSI-BLAST pairwise alignments and
structural alignments obtained with the DALI program. Similarity-based clustering of proteins was carried out using the
BLASTCLUST program [42]. The MEGA program (version
2.1) was used for phylogenetic inference with the neighborjoining algorithm [43]. The pairwise distances were estimated using the p-distance method. The Bayesian posterior
probability trees were constructed using the MRBAYES program [44]. The maximum-likelihood tree was constructed
using the following process: a least-squares tree was constructed using the FITCH program of the PHYLIP package or
a neighbor-joining tree with the MEGA program. This was
followed by local rearrangements using the ProtML program
of the Molphy package to arrive at the maximum likelihood
(ML) tree [45-47]. The statistical significance of various
nodes of this ML tree was assessed using the relative estimate
of logarithmic likelihood bootstrap (Protml RELL-BP), with
10,000 replicates.
Structural manipulations were carried out using the SwissPDB viewer version 3.7 program [48]. Searches of the PDB
database, or custom set of target structure with a given query
structure was conducted using the DALI and the VAST programs [49,50]. Interatomic distances in structure were determined using the Swiss-PDB viewer and ribbon diagrams were
constructed using the MOLSCRIPT program [51].
