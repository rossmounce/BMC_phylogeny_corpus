Abstract
Background: Phylogenies of certain bioenergetic enzymes have proved to be useful tools for
deducing evolutionary ancestry of bioenergetic pathways and their relationship to geochemical
parameters of the environment. Our previous phylogenetic analysis of arsenite oxidase, the
molybdopterin enzyme responsible for the biological oxidation of arsenite to arsenate, indicated
its probable emergence prior to the Archaea/Bacteria split more than 3 billion years ago, in line
with the geochemical fact that arsenite was present in biological habitats on the early Earth.
Respiratory arsenate reductase (Arr), another molybdopterin enzyme involved in microbial arsenic
metabolism, serves as terminal oxidase, and is thus situated at the opposite end of bioenergetic
electron transfer chains as compared to arsenite oxidase. The evolutionary history of the Arrenzyme has not been studied in detail so far.
Results: We performed a genomic search of genes related to arrA coding for the molybdopterin
subunit. The multiple alignment of the retrieved sequences served to reconstruct a neighborjoining phylogeny of Arr and closely related enzymes. Our analysis confirmed the previously
proposed proximity of Arr to the cluster of polysulfide/thiosulfate reductases but also unravels a
hitherto unrecognized clade even more closely related to Arr. The obtained phylogeny strongly
suggests that Arr originated after the Bacteria/Archaea divergence in the domain Bacteria, and was
subsequently laterally distributed within this domain. It further more indicates that, as a result of
accumulation of arsenate in the environment, an enzyme related to polysulfide reductase and not
to arsenite oxidase has evolved into Arr.
Conclusion: These findings are paleogeochemically rationalized by the fact that the accumulation
of arsenate over arsenite required the increase in oxidation state of the environment brought
about by oxygenic photosynthesis.

Background
Prokaryotes are able to use a plethora of organic and inorganic substances as electron donating/accepting substrates for their bioenergetic metabolisms. In contrast to
the substrate versatility of these bioenergetic chains stands
the relatively monotonous architecture of the enzymes
involved. These enzymes appear as variations on only a
small number of fundamental themes [1] and it seems
that many if not most of these enzymes and even complete bioenergetic chains are almost as old as life itself [24]. The enormous versatility of bioenergetic metabolism
makes particular sense in the first billion years of life on
Earth, prior to the rise of molecular oxygen in the biosphere, i.e. before this large reservoir of bioenergetic fuel
for aerobic respiration was available.
Arsenics are notorious for their toxicity. This deleterious
property nonwithstanding, reduced (arsenite) and oxidized (arsenate) arsenics are recruited by prokaryotes as
bioenergetic fuel. Two enzyme systems are presently
known to mediate the bioenergetic use of arsenics, i.e.
arsenite oxidase and respiratory arsenate reductase. A confusing multitude of acronyms denoting these two
enzymes can be found in the literature, whereof Aro (for
Arsenite oxidase) and Arr (for Arsenate reductase) appear
as the most sensible couple of acronyms to us. These
denominations are therefore used throughout this work.
The enzyme Aro serves as entry point for reducing equivalents issued from the oxidation of the arsenic oxianion
arsenite (AsIII) to arsenate (AsV) into bioenergetic chains.
The enzyme Arr, by contrast, plays the role of a terminal
oxidase in prokaryotic energy conversion (for reviews, see
[5-8]) and is thus situated at the opposite end of bioenergetic electron transfer chains with respect to its "sisterenzyme" Aro.
Both Aro and Arr are members of a large group of molybdopterin-containing enzymes, commonly referred to as
the DMSO superfamily. This superfamily is a textbook
example of the above mentioned construction-kit type
variation on a theme. The large catalytic molybdopterinsubunit is present in all members of the DMSO superfamily supplemented by a variable number of additional
subunits to spawn the multitude of individual subfamilies. In arsenite oxidase, the unique additional subunit is a [2Fe-2S] protein belonging to the family of Rieskeproteins [9].
We have previously studied the phylogeny of both subunits from arsenite oxidase [4-10] and have proposed on
the basis of these results that this enzyme has emerged
prior to the Archaea/Bacteria split more than 3 billions
years ago. Such an early emergence of an enzyme system
using arsenite as electron donor for bioenergetic chains

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/206

makes sense since arsenite is likely to have been present in
substantial amounts in the habitats of the early Earth.
Microbes capable of respiring arsenate have been discovered more than a decade ago [11,12]. A molybdopterin
enzyme responsible for this metabolic capacity was subsequently described and biochemically analysed in five different arsenate reducing Eubacteria [13-17]. More
recently, the corresponding enzyme in Shewanella sp.
ANA-3 was shown to be encoded by the "arr" gene cluster
[13] and the presence of arr-genes was demonstrated by
arrA amplification in 13 arsenate-respiring bacteria [18].
The typical arr operon contains arrA and arrB genes coding for hydrophilic proteins with molecular weights of
~96 kDa and ~26 kDa, respectively [13,15]. Based on the
lack of a membrane-anchoring subunit in most known
cases and the presence of a fully conserved twin arginine
translocation (TAT) signal in ArrA sequences, respiratory
arsenate reductase has been proposed to be a periplasmic
enzyme and to be in most cases soluble (reviewed by Stolz
et al. [8]). Whereas the Chrysiogenes arsenatis enzyme [15]
indeed was found in the soluble fraction, in Bacillus selenitireducens the arsenate reductase had to be purified from
membrane fractions [16]. In both cases, the purified
enzyme only contained the A and B subunits. However,
several cases of arr operons containing a gene coding for a
putative membrane protein have been reported (see Stolz
et al. [8]) suggesting a possible role of these proteins for
membrane-association of arsenate reductase in selected
cases.
The cofactor composition of the enzyme has been predicted from amino acid sequences and was confirmed by
metal analyses [15,16]. The amino acid sequence of ArrA
features two cofactor binding motifs: a cysteine-rich
stretch at the N-terminus predicted to coordinate an ironsulfur cluster and a molybdopterin dinucleotide-binding
domain. The amino-acid sequence of ArrB indicates the
presence of four cubane-type iron-sulfur clusters
(reviewed in Stolz et al. [8]). With respect to subunit composition, arsenate reductase is thus significantly different
from arsenite oxidase which contains a structurally completely unrelated [2Fe-2S]-protein (see above) rather than
the tetracubane-type ferredoxin subunit ArrB. In line with
this difference, previously published sequence comparisons indicated a quite distant relationship between arsenite oxidase and arsenate reductase with respect to their
Molybdopterin-subunits [7,8,18].
Such strong divergence between these enzymes is intriguing considering that the reaction of the catalytic site in the
two molybdopterin enzymes is the same, only in reverse.
No comprehensive phylogenetic study of the enzyme and
its relationship to other closely related subfamilies of the

DMSO reductase superfamily has been performed so far.
Previously reported phylogenies either considered only a
few members of the DMSO superfamily (when dealing
with Arr sequences [8]) or completely disregarded arr
genes (when dealing with a more general phylogeny of the
DMSO superfamily [19,20]). To gain further insight into
the evolutionary history of respiratory arsenate reductase,
we performed an exhaustive genomic search of genes
related to arrA and reconstructed the overall phylogeny of
arsenate reductase, arsenite oxidase as well as further
genes closely related to these enzymes.
Our genomic survey firmly established the previously proposed proximity of arsenate reductase to the family of
sulfide reductases but also unraveled the existence of a
novel clade even more closely related to arsenate reductase, the physiological function of which is still unknown.
The obtained tree topologies demonstrate that, unlike
arsenite oxidase, the respiratory arsenate reductase is a
more recent invention of the bacterial subtree and most
probably derives from an enzyme involved in sulfur
metabolism. The implications concerning paleogeochemical availability of respiratory substrates as a function of
the oxidation state of the environment are discussed.

Results
Data mining and sequence analyses
When we initiated this study, only eleven arrA sequences
from 26 arsenate respiring species were available. In the
four species Bacillus arseniciselenatis, Bacillus selenitireducens, Chrysiogenes arsenatis, Sulfurospirillum barnesii and
Desulfosporosinus sp. strains Y5 and DCB-2, only the arrA
gene has been sequenced (by PCR see [18,21]) and the
subunit composition of the enzyme is unknown. Only six
Arr operons were therefore available in previous analyses
[8]. Starting from this set of sequences, we searched for
further homologous genes in whole genome databases
using arrA from Shewanella ANA-3 as query sequence. This
search yielded a multitude of putative molybdopterinproteins. Only genes located near putative arrB sequences
(homologous to Shewanella arrB) and possessing the
three conserved motifs (shown in Figure 1), i.e. the TAT
signal sequence, the molybdopterin binding domain, and
the [4Fe-4S] binding domain, were retained in a first selection step. Intriguingly, many so-defined gene clusters contained a third gene adjacent to the arrAB diade. This gene
was already noticed previously and, due to its relatedness
to the psrC gene of polysulfide reductase (see below),
denoted as "arrC".

It is noteworthy that several of the species described to
respire arsenate lack the arrA gene [18] and their metabolic capacity to respire arsenate is therefore probably
conferred by a different, hitherto unknown, enzyme.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/206

As has already been noticed in the past [15,16,18,21],
BLAST scores indicate strong similarities between the catalytic A-subunits of Arr and of the enzyme polysulfide
reductase (Psr) and we therefore included Psr gene clusters in our data searches. However, since Psr is not the
focus of this work, only selected representatives of Psr
were considered for tree reconstructions covering as much
as possible the phylogenetic tree of species. BLAST
searches with PsrA from Wolinella succinogenes [22] as
query sequence recognized all arrA genes already retrieved
via ArrA from Shewanella ANA-3 but also yielded further
genes as discussed below. BLAST scores are therefore
insufficient to reliably distinguish between arrA and psrA.
However, as will be shown below, both the phylogeny of
the catalytic subunit and the distinctive organisation of
gene clusters allow an unambiguous identification of the
retrieved genes.
A further enzyme involved in bioenergetic sulfur metabolism and containing the three canonical subunits A, B and
C has been described in the literature, i.e. the tetrathionate
reductase (Ttr) from Salmonella typhimurium [23]. High
sequence similarities between the A-subunits from Ttr and
Psr have been noticed previously [23-26]. We therefore
decided to include Ttr sequences in our genome mining
approach. Using ttrA from Salmonella typhimurium as
query sequence, we searched for homologous genes in
whole genome databases. This search yielded a multitude
of putative TtrA proteins from which representative cases
were included in the phylogenetic reconstruction.
In addition to sequences which are closely related to
known arsenate reductases, we added the so far known
cases of arsenite oxidases [4,8], replenished with new
sequences retrieved during our present genomic survey.
We would like to emphasize that the partial AroA
sequences reported by Inskeep et al. [27] were not
included in our tree reconstruction. These sequences represent only a small fraction of the full-length protein and
including these partial ORFs substantially lowers the reliability of the obtained trees. Selected representatives of
the "standard" molybdopterin enzymes formate dehydrogenase [28,29], DMSO reductase [30] and nitrate reductase [31,32] have furthermore been included in the set of
sequences used for tree reconstruction (all protein accession numbers, related to its related enzyme and strain are
listed in the Additional file 1). For the DMSO reductase
case, only representatives containing the iron sulfur binding motif in the N-terminal domain of the molybdopterin
subunit [30] were considered.

Figure 1
Conserved motifs encountered in the sequences of the molybdo-subunits ArrA, UnkA or Psr/PhsA
Conserved motifs encountered in the sequences of the molybdo-subunits ArrA, UnkA or Psr/PhsA. a. To the
exeption of one subclass of the Unk sequences (see the text for more details), all three clades feature the TAT (twin-arginine
translocation) signal sequence at the N-terminus. b. All three types of molybdo-subunits contain the motif for binding an ironsulfur cluster (C-X2-C-X3-C-X27-C) near the N-terminus. c. Amino acid sequence alignment of the molybdenum-binding
domain indicates a conserved cysteine residue which is likely to represent the amino acid that coordinates to the molybdenum.

the Neighbor-Joining (NJ)-method is shown in Fig. 2. In
addition to the well-known clusters formed by DMSO and
nitrate reductases as well as formate dehydrogenases, the
tree features 6 well-defined clades (Figs. 2 and 3). The reliability of these clades is supported by their coincidence
with an evolutionary marker, i.e. the gene organisation of
A, B and C genes within the respective gene clusters. As
indicated in Fig. 3, the order of these three genes as well as
the location of the TAT motif varies between clades but is
conserved within each individual clade.
The Arr clade is characterized by either arrCAB or arrAB
gene clusters, i.e. positioning the gene encoding the membrane anchor protein upstream of the arrAB diade or completely lacking this gene (branches indicated by # on Fig.
2). No archaeal Arr representatives could be detected and
the retrieved sequences in fact arise exclusively from δ-, ε, γ-proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Chlostridia. The topol-

ogy of the Arr subtree differs significantly from that of species trees. Despite specific efforts, we only found three
new unambiguous arrA sequences i.e. those from
Alkalilimnicola ehrlichii, Geobacter lovleyi SZ, and
Shewanella sp. W3-18-1. Gene clusters coding for respiratory arsenate reductases therefore appear to be rare as
compared to those of their sister enzymes (see below). A
tentative rationalisation for this observation will be given
in the Discussion Section.
As mentioned above, the Psr enzyme is often cited as closest relative of respiratory arsenate reductases. Polysulfide
reductases (Psr) perform the respiratory conversion of elemental sulfur to H2S. Since S° is rather insoluble in aqueous solutions, an alternative form of sulfur, polysulfide, is
generally considered to be the actual substrate for sulfur
respiration. Polysulfide reductase from Wolinella succinogenes was the first enzyme from this class to be sequenced

(Nas, Nar, Aro or FdhH) or subfamilies (Unk). Arsenite oxidase (Aro) forms a separate and distant clade and is therefore used
as outgroup. Arsenate reductase (Arr), the new uncharacterized molybdoenzyme (Unk, see the text), tetrathionate reductase
(Ttr) and polysulfide reductase/thiosulfate reductase (Psr/Phs) form distinct but related clades. Whereas representatives of the
Psr/Phs clade all contain the anchor subunit, some representatives of the Unk and Arr clades (marked with #) were lacking this
subunit. aOnly the sequence of the A subunit of Bacillus arsenicoselenatis is known. bThe Arr of Sulfurospirillum barnesii has been
demonstrated biochemically to be composed of three subunits but only the A subunit has been sequenced. cThe Arr of Alkaliphilus oremlandii (formely Clostridium sp.) OhILAs and Alkaliphilus metalliredigenes have been published as composed of three
subunits. We failed, however, to detect a typical ArrC subunit in the Arr operon. On the other hand our study revealed Arr
operons in Geobacter lovleyi SZ, Shewanella sp. W3-18-1 and Alkalilimicola ehrlichei MLHE-1, the two first without and the last
with the third subunit C, respectively.

Schematic phylogenetic (unrooted neighbor joining) tree of the molybdenum subunits of the DMSO reductase superfamily
Figure 3
Schematic phylogenetic (unrooted neighbor joining) tree of the molybdenum subunits of the DMSO reductase
superfamily. Arsenite oxidase (Aro) forms a clade distant from arsenate reductases (Arr) with the dichotomy Bacteria (in
dark grey)/Archaea (in light grey) indicating that the origin of this enzyme pre-dates the divergence of domains. The same
dichotomy is also observed within the Psr/Phs and the Ttr clades. A corresponding dichotomy is less obvious for the Unk clade
and clearly absent in the Arr family. The operons of all four families: Psr/Phs, Ttr, Unk and Arr, have three genes in common
denoted A, B and C, coding for the molybdo-(with the TAT signal marked in black), iron-sulfur- and anchor-subunits, respectively. These three genes are arranged in the Psr/Phs operon in the same order as in the Escherichia coli dms operon, i.e. ABC.
In the case of the arr operon the order is CAB, C occasionnally missing (marked by #). In the case of the ttr and unk (when C
is present) operon, the order is BCA. In this family a subgroup (highlighted by the hatched circle), lacks the C subunit and the
TAT signal on the A subunit (marked by*) and contains abnormally large subunit B and therefore possibly represents a separate
type of enzyme.

[21] and homologous genes have been identified more
recently in the Archaea Pyrobaculum aerophilum [33] and
Archaeoglobus fulgidus [34]. In addition to the molybdopterin catalytic subunit PsrA and the tetracubane ferredoxin
PsrB, polysulfide reductase contains a third subunit
denoted PsrC. PsrC is a membrane-integral protein and is
considered to serve as membrane anchor for the extrinsic
subunits PsrA and PsrB. The PsrC protein seems to harbor
the site where quinol is oxidized and thus to furnish

reducing equivalents ultimately consumed in the reduction of polysulfide [35]. PsrC therefore is an indispensable part of the whole enzyme and is consequently present
in all Psr gene clusters.
In the Psr clade, gene clusters are arranged in the order
ABC, i.e. the gene coding for the catalytic molybdopterin
subunit is followed by that encoding the tetracubane iron
sulfur protein whereas the gene of the membrane-integral

Page 6 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:206

protein comes last (Fig. 3). In contrast to the situation in
the Arr cluster, the psrC gene is present in all branches of
the Psr clade. This operon organisation is by the way similar to that of DMSO reductase (dmsABC). The congruence
of phylogenetic grouping and gene cluster structure (Fig.
3) strongly corroborates the attribution of function suggested by the observed clade. The genes yielding several of
the branches in the Psr clade are not annotated in accordance with the clade, that is the Psr clade contains members
annotated as arrA or even featuring more exotic attributions suggesting the necessity of reannotating the aberrantly denoted genes.
It is noteworthy that one branch within the clade denoted
"Psr" in fact represents an enzyme which has been biochemically characterized in Salmonella typhimurium to be a
thiosulfate reductase (Phs) rather than a polysulfide
reductase [36]. The gene cluster encoding this enzyme in
Salmonella typhimurium features an "ABC-order", just as
the bona fide Psr cases do. Both Psr and Phs use electrons
from the quinone pool to reduce S° and S2O32-, respectively, to H2S. These enzymatically very similar reactions
thus seem to be catalysed by evolutionarily closely related
enzymes. The ensuing high sequence similarities between
the catalytic subunits of polysulfide and thiosulfate
reductases render a straightforward classification of genes
retrieved in our genome mining into one or the other
group of enzymes difficult. A possible clue for this purpose may reside in the length of the C-subunit. Whereas
PsrC from the biochemically characterized polysulfide
reductase from Wolinella succinogenes has 8 predicted
transmembrane (TM) helices, only 5 TM stretches are
observed in PhsC from the thiosulfate reductase of Salmonella typhimurium. According to this criterion, the
branches labeled DesDe, SalEn, HalHa and AlkEh would
be thiosulfate rather than polysulfide reductases. However, only a detailed functional characterization of all
members of this subclade will definitively settle this question and we therefore opted to denote the corresponding
branches as psr/phs.
The Psr/Phs clade is characterized by a profound cleavage
into archaeal and bacterial branches suggesting an origin
of this enzyme system prior to the divergence of domains.
In contrast to the notion frequently put forward that Psr is
most closely related to Arr, two additional clades are
observed in Figs. 2 and 3 in between the arsenate and the
polysulfide/thiosulfate reductase clusters. One of these
clades contains the biochemically characterized
tetrathionate reductase (Ttr) from Salmonella typhimurium
and we therefore call this subtree the Ttr clade. All
enzymes constituting this clade are encoded by gene clusters featuring the order BCA and an additional TAT signal
on the B subunit [26], differing from all other clades discussed so far. Similar to the Psr clade, however, the Ttr

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/206

subtree shows a deep bifurcation into archaeal and bacterial branches indicating an origin of this enzyme within
the common ancestor of the two prokaryotic domains.
A subset of sequences retrieved in this genome survey
forms a clade which contains neither bona fide Arr, nor
Psr/Phs, nor Ttr enzymes. Once again, this clade features a
conserved structure of its encoding gene cluster which differentiates it from the arr and psr/phs classes. The AB diade
is inverted in this clade and in some cases is separated by
the membrane anchor protein yielding a BCA order of
genes (Fig. 3), i.e. reminiscent of that seen in the Ttr clade.
In this group of sequences, all cases lacking the membrane-anchor protein cluster together (marked by # in Fig.
2), contain a larger tetracubane subunit (60 kDa instead
of 26 kDa) and lack the TAT signal sequence (marked by
* in Fig. 2) in the molybdopterin subunit. These cases
therefore form a distinct subgroup. Moreover, two long
proteobacterial branches (Azoarcus sp. EbN1 and Dechloromonas aromatica RCB) appear as outgroup to the remaining sequences in this group. A detailed inspection of their
A and B subunits' sequences clearly establishes their divergence from the main group. This clade therefore likely represents three distinct types of enzymes. For none of the
branches in this clade, the encoded enzymes have been
studied so far. The metabolic function/functions of this
class of enzymes is/are thus so far unknown and we correspondingly chose to label the respective genes as unkA,
unkB and unkC.
With respect to the previously studied set of arsenite oxidases (Aro) [4,8], our present genome survey detected several new genes strongly similar to those of Aro. Four of
these new sequences in fact do not cluster within the Aroclade but branch off close to this family. Although in all
four cases, the gene coding for a Rieske protein is present
upstream of the molybdenum-subunit, just as in genuine
Aro-operons, their gene clusters feature several conserved
ORFs not present in Aro operons. Furthermore, this set of
four sequences differs significantly from those of the Aro
cluster by several distinctive stretches of residues. The fact
that none of the parent species has been described to perform the oxidation of arsenite indicates that this clade represents a new subclass of molybdopterin-enzymes with
hitherto unknown function and we correspondingly
denote the catalytic subunits of this clade as as "ArolikeA".
With respect to the genuine Aro subtree, the phylogeny
shown in Figures 2 and 3 corroborates the conclusions
arrived at in our previous work suggesting this enzyme to
have already been present in the Last Universal Common
Ancestor (see [4]). An early origin of arsenite oxidase is
also predicted by the position of its Rieske subunit on a
tree encompassing arsenite oxidases and Rieske/cytb complexes [10]. The unrooted tree shown in Fig. 3 thus

Page 7 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:206

strongly suggests the clade containing Aro and the closely
related enzyme of unknown function (Arolike) as outgroup to the other molybdopterin enzymes. This scenario
contradicts that published by McEwan et al. [19] considering arsenite oxidases as having evolved from a Nas/Nap/
Fdh-type ancestor.
As discussed above, the phylogenetic trees shown in Fig. 2
and 3 are based on the sequences of the catalytic molybdopterin subunit, i.e. the A-subunit. Since Arr, Psr/Phs, Ttr
and Unk all contain the tetracubane iron-sulfur (B-) as
well as the membrane-integral C-subunit, it may appear
tempting to corroborate the A-phylogeny by those
obtained from these additional subunits. However, as we
have already stated in a previous article [1] and as is obvious from the results obtained by Rothery et al [20], these
two subunits are ill-suited for phylogenetic studies. The Bsubunit is a small protein of about 22 kDa featuring a high
number of strictly conserved residues necessary for ligating the four iron-sulfur clusters (cysteines) and maintaining the required loop structure (prolines). The number of
phylogenetically informative sites is therefore small and
insufficient to resolve the long evolutionary distances relevant to our work. The C-subunit, also being much
smaller than the A-subunit, is complicated by its complete
absence of fully conserved residues and by its variable
sequence length. Reliable multiple alignments of C-subunit sequences are difficult to attain as long as no 3D-structures are available.
The membrane-integral C-subunit
The "C"-genes retrieved for members of the Arr, Psr/Phs
and Unk-families all code for hydrophobic proteins of
about 30 kDa containing at least 5 predicted TM helices.
Members from all three families are obtained with significant expectation values in BLAST searches using any of
the individual ArrC, Psr/PhsC and UnkC sequences as
queries and the dmsC gene of DMSO reductases is also recognized. Multiple sequence alignments show that the
members of all four families are indeed related with significant sequence similarities in the C-terminal part of the
protein (not shown), but in contrast to what is observed
for the molybdopterin subunit, no fully conserved residue
positions are detected if all four families are compared.

The membrane-integral C-subunits of Arr, Psr/Phs, Unk,
Ttr and DMSO reductase thus probably represent a common module employed by these molybdopterin enzymes
for the purpose of membrane attachment and, most probably, mediating electron exchange with the quinone pool.
The absence of conserved residues such as histidines
argues against the presence of heme cofactors in these Csubunits, contrary to what is claimed in some annotations. Correspondingly, in none of the studied systems,
experimental evidence for heme prosthetic groups in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/206

these enzyme complexes has been reported. The C-subunits of these five families thus differ from other groups of
the molybdopterin superfamily, which can contain small
helix-bundle diheme b-type cytochromes (formate dehydrogenase and Nar nitrate reductase, [29,37-39]) or membrane-tethered globular tetraheme c-type cytochromes
(called the NapC/Nir-family, see for example [40]) to connect the intra-enzyme electron transfer to the quinone
pool.

Discussion
Arsenite oxidase and respiratory arsenate reductase are
phylogenetically only distantly related
Three enzyme systems are so far known to mediate redox
conversions of arsenics. One of them, i.e. the so-called
arsC/acr2-system, serve a purely detoxifying function, is
cytoplasmic and consumes ATP during the detoxifying
reduction (and extrusion from the cytoplasm) of arsenic
[for recent reviews see [5,41]]. The corresponding
enzymes do not contain metal-cofactors and are evolutionarily unrelated to the two systems dealt with in this
work, i.e. the bioenergetic enzymes arsenite oxidase and
respiratory arsenate reductase.

Arsenite oxidase is generally considered to catalyse the
two-electron oxidation reaction of AsIII to AsV and to pass
the reducing equivalents on to soluble periplasmic electron shuttle proteins, such as cytochromes or copper proteins [42-44]. The more recently discovered enzyme
respiratory arsenate reductase is thought to perform this
reaction in reverse. Although both enzymes indeed use
molybdopterin proteins from the DMSO reductase superfamily to catalyze this reaction, their subunit composition
differs substantially with Arr containing a tetracubane FeS protein rather than the Rieske subunit of Aro as second
subunit in the enzyme complex. Previous phylogenetic
analyses based on a small sample of sequences also indicated a rather distant relationship between these two
enzymes [8]. In order to better understand these puzzling
findings, we screened available genomes for gene clusters
related to arsenate reductase. The results detailed above
fully confirm the absence of a direct evolutionary link
between Aro and Arr.
Respiratory arsenate reductase instead forms a compact
phylogenetic clade which is most closely related to an
enzyme of so-far unknown function the representatives of
which also cluster together in a tight clade. Both these
clades are phylogenetically close to the groups of
polysulfide/thiosulfate (Psr/Phs) and tetrathionate
reductases (Ttr). Sequence homologies between Psr/Phs
and Ttr have already been emphasized [23-25].

Deducing evolutionary histories from the comparison of
enzyme and species phylogenies
As already discussed in previous articles [4,10] and corroborated by the extended data set of the present work,
phylogenies of both subunits of arsenite oxidase closely
match those of the parent species. Both archaeal and bacterial representatives of the enzyme have been detected
and the two domains are well-separated on phylogenetic
trees of Aro's molybdenum and Rieske subunits. This
enzyme complex thus shows distinctive characteristics
suggesting its evolutionary origin to pre-date the Archaea/
Bacteria cleavage some 3 billion years ago.

The situation is radically different for the phylogeny
obtained for Arr (Fig. 2). On the Arr subtree, (δ-, ε- and γ) proteobacterial sequences are intermingled with those
from Firmicutes and Chlostridia. Even the various proteobacterial lineages do not cluster together and δ-, ε- and γproteobacterial representatives seem almost erratically
scattered over this subtree. Despite specific effort to this
end, we were unable to find any archaeal members of this
family. This result is in accordance with the result of Malasarn et al. [18] who failed to amplify arrA genes in archaeal
AsV respiring species. The phylogeny of Arr thus provides
a textbook example of an enzyme distributed over a range
of species largely via horizontal gene transfer. The presently available sample of sequences would suggest an origin in a γ-proteobacterium followed by dispersal over the
other observed phyla. However, with increasing numbers
of genomes containing arr gene clusters, this specific scenario may well require modifications.
The detailed affiliation of the Arr subtree to those of the
Psr/Phs, Ttr and Unk-enzymes provides hints for the evolutionary origin of arsenate reductase. The overall tree
topology suggests that all three, Arr, Ttr and Unk, are
derived from an enzyme closely related to the ancestor of
Psr/Phs. Our genome search suggests that Ttr, originally
considered to be specific to Enterobacteriaceae [23], is
widely distributed among Archaea and Bacteria. Our
results futhermore suggest an early origin of this enzyme,
prior to the Archaea/Bacteria split. For the case of Arr, the
root of the enzyme appears to lie in the bacterial domain
according to the presently available ensemble of
sequences. The case is less clear-cut for the case of the Unk
enzyme, since in the absence of any biochemical/molecular biological evidence we propose to consider this group
as three distinct clades. Biochemical characterization of
selected enzymes is thus required before the clade previously called Unk can be interpreted properly.
We would like to note that in many previous articles dealing with phylogenies of members of the DMSO superfamily [8,20], the general aspect of trees differs
substantially from that of our tree by the predominance of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/206

deep branching nodes and very long branches. Although
no respective information is provided in the Materials and
Methods Sections of these articles, we strongly suspect
that the corresponding trees were reconstructed neglecting
the possibility of multiple substitutions. Regarding the
enormous evolutionary distances between the respective
enzymes, we consider this approach as erroneous and
would insist on the fact that multiple substitutions need
to be allowed for.
Sulfur respiration and the related enzymes are widespread
among Bacteria and Archaea [24]. In aqueous solution,
sulfur occurs in a variety of compounds including
polysulfides and polythionates. Diverse organisms are
able to use these sulfur species as respiratory electron
acceptors by reductively cleaving the sulfur-sulfur bonds.
In many cases, the enzymes catalysing these reactions contain a bis(molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide)molybdenum (MGD) cofactor at the catalytic site. The best studied
examples of such enzymes are the tetrathionate (Ttr)
[35,46], thiosulfate (Phs) [35] and polysulfide reductases
(Psr) [24]. It has been demonstrated that, in Salmonella
enterica, which contains both Ttr and Phs, Phs was unable
to restore a tetrathionate reduction in a ttr-mutant [25]
but reduced polysulfide. This result is in accordance with
the obtained phylogenetic tree suggesting that Psr and Phs
are phylogenetically much more closely related to each
other than to Ttr. Corresponding cross-reactivities of Arr
and Phs/Psr towards thiosulfate, polysulfide and arsenate
have not been studied so far. However, it is interesting to
note that Phs is capable of reducing chlorate to chlorite
[45]. This reduction involves an oxygen atom transfer, just
as the reduction of arsenate to arsenite, rather than the
sulfur-sulfur bond cleavage of thiosulfate reduction. It
therefore is tempting to consider that Phs/Psr may by
themselves be able to perform arsenate reduction. The
observed sequence homologies indeed suggest that arsenate reductase evolved from a Phs/Psr ancestor. Rather
than reversing the reaction mechanism of arsenite oxidase, evolution modified an enzyme of the sulfur respiration pathway, the ancestor of the Psr/Phs, to create the
arsenate reductase.
Paleogeochemical and bioenergetic constraints rationalize
the differing evolutionary histories of arsenate reductase
and related enzymes
Reduced arsenics such as arsenite are present in significant
quantities in modern hydrothermal environments and are
likely to have been so throughout Earth's history back to
the Archaean and Hadean era. It thus isn't astonishing
that life should have used this abundantly available
source of reducing equivalents via arsenite oxidase as electron donor to bioenergetic electron transfer chains already
in its early days.

In extant environments, the conversion of AsIII to AsV
requires the presence of molecular oxygen. O2, however,
is considered to have been virtually absent in the archaean
world, i.e. prior to its accumulation via oxygenic photosynthesis. Paleogeochemical evidence shows that molecular oxygen becomes detectable in the biosphere of our
planet by 2.4 Ga ago [46]. Almost certainly, oxygenic photosynthesis has produced O2 long before that date [47].
The time span needed to exhaust the reservoir of reductant
(mostly Fe2+) in the biosphere before net O2 started to
increase is a matter of dispute. It seems likely, though, that
prior to the Bacteria/Archaea cleavage, no O2 was produced photosynthetically [48]. During this period of
Earth's history, the ambient potential of the environment
was thus much lower than today and biological oxidation
of arsenite to arsenate was probably the only mechanism
producing oxidized arsenics. Moreover, the above mentioned reductant reservoir will have rereduced the arsenate formed by such oxidation mechanisms. Substantial
accumulation of arsenate had to await the increase of the
oxidation state of the biosphere brought about by oxygenic photosynthesis. Only at that moment, arsenate
turned into a potential substrate for bioenergetic chains
by serving as terminal electron acceptor. Based on the
phylogenies we observe on the respective enzymes, it
seems likely that at this time, an enzyme related to
polysulfide reductase has evolved into an arsenate reductase. The substantially lower redox potential of thiosulfate
( E 0 ’(S O 2- / HS − ) = -400 mV), and sulfur ( E 0 ’(S 0 / HS − ) = 2

of arsenic oxyanions, the chemistry of sulfur is complicated and multiple reaction pathways to arrive at a given
compound are accessible. Disproportionation reactions,
for example, may account for the production of relatively
oxidized sulfur species [49] even at low redox potentials.
A more detailed analysis of the enzyme tetrathionate
reductase has therefore been initiated in our group.
Considering basic bioenergetic features of respiratory
arsenate reduction, the energetic benefit of this mechanism is expected to be much lower than that or the other
systems discussed in this work. The oxidized oxyanion of
arsenic, i.e. arsenate, has a pK value slightly below 7,
whereas the corresponding pK is shifted by two pH-units
to more alkaline values in the reduced arsenite. At neutral
pH and below, the redox reaction of arsenic thus corresponds to
H2AsO4- + 3 H+ + 2 e- <---> H3AsO3 + H2O (below pK of
arsenate)
HAsO42- + 4 H+ + 2 e- <---> H3AsO3 + H2O (above pK)
Biochemically characterized respiratory arsenate reductases have been shown to be located on the periplasmic
side of the membrane [15,16]. This location can most
probably be generalized to all members of the family as
judged by the presence of the TAT signal in all retrieved
ArrA sequences. Such a reduction of arsenate and concommitant consumption of protons in the periplasm is
strongly counterproductive for a respiratory enzyme in
that it contributes to collapsing rather than generating the
proton-motive-force required for ATP synthesis.

275 mV), as compared to that of the AsV/AsIII couple (Em
= +60 mV) suggests that oxidized sulfur compounds were
available as electron acceptors already at much lower oxidation states of the environment, i.e. much earlier than
the arsenics. This fact rationalizes the evolutionary ancestry of sulfur-reducing mechanisms, as suggested by the
Psr/Phs phylogeny shown in Fig. 2, over that involving the
reduction of arsenate.
In this context, the case of the tetrathionate reductase is
intringuing. The phylogeny of this enzyme as shown in
Figure 2 clearly suggests a pre-divergence origin. Chemically, the most straightforward way to produce tetrathionate is via thiosulfate. The midpoint potential of this redox
couple is relatively high ( E 0 ’(S O 2- / S O 2- ) = +24 mV) and
4

The situation is less dramatic if not only the enzyme but
also its embeddedness in the bioenergetic chain is taken
into account. As discussed above, the presence of the
membrane anchor protein ArrC and its strong relatedness
to the PsrC subunit of polysulfide reductase, suggest that,
in the species where ArrAB is complemented by ArrC, the
electrons serving to reduce arsenate are derived from oxidation of a quinol binding at the ArrC subunit. Assuming
that the quinol binding site on ArrC was located such that
the protons arising from quinol oxidation are ejected into
the periplasm, the combined reaction would read as follows:
H2AsO4- + H+ + QH2 <---> H3AsO3 + H2O (below pK of
arsenate)

formation of tetrathionate from thiosulfate would thus
probably require a relatively high oxidation state of the
environment as detailed above for the case of arsenic.
However, in contrast to the simple redox couple AsIII/AsV

For the species where ArrC is absent, the enzyme appears
to be coupled to the quinone pool by other proteins. In
Shewanella for example, where only ArrA and ArrB are
present, a membrane-tethered periplasmic c-type cyto-

chrome, CymA, has been shown to be involved in the respiration of arsenate [50]. CymA is also required for
respiration of fumarate, nitrate, Fe(III), DMSO and nitrite
[51] and thus apparently acts as common branching point
between the quinone pool and multiple terminal oxidases. CymA belongs to the NapC/NirT family which has
been shown in other enzymes to mediate electron transfer
between the liposoluble quinone pool and molybdopterin enzymes. Several different solutions may therefore
be employed by different species to connect the two-subunit Arr enzymes to the quinone pool.
With increasing oxygen content of the environment,
bioenergetic mechanisms, optimized to the low redox
poise of an anoxic Earth, had to adapt to these environmental changes. This task has been achieved in several
phyla of the prokaryotes (both Bacteria and Archaea) by
increasing the redox potentials of all cofactors involved in
the respective energy conserving chains. Such a shift in
redox poise of whole chains necessarily implies the
replacement of the ancestral low potential (Em = -70 mV)
menaquinones by higher potential (Em = +100 mV) quinones such as ubi-, plasto- or caldariellaquinone [52,53].
As discussed above, the reducing equivalents for the
reduction of arsenate appear to be furnished directly by
the quinone pool. However, considering the above mentioned midpoint potentials of quinone species and of the
arsenate/arsenite couple, a substantial driving force for
electron transfer from the quinone pool to arsenate is only
expected if the pool is constituted by low potential
menaquinones. In line with this reasoning, almost all species containing Arr gene clusters indeed use menaquinone
for their liposoluble electron transfer. Even more intriguingly, one species which contains the Arr gene cluster but
uses the higher potential ubiquinone, i.e. Alkalilimnicola
ehrlichii has been shown to be unable to respire arsenate
[54]. Energetic considerations therefore predict that only
a very limited set of organisms can use arsenate for bioenergetic ends. These energetic constraints may well rationalize the small number of Arr gene clusters that we were
able to detect in published genomes as compared to those
of closely related enzyme systems.
