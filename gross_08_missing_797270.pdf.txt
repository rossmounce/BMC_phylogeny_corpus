Abstract
Background: Bordetella petrii is the only environmental species hitherto found among the
otherwise host-restricted and pathogenic members of the genus Bordetella. Phylogenetically, it
connects the pathogenic Bordetellae and environmental bacteria of the genera Achromobacter and
Alcaligenes, which are opportunistic pathogens. B. petrii strains have been isolated from very
different environmental niches, including river sediment, polluted soil, marine sponges and a grass
root. Recently, clinical isolates associated with bone degenerative disease or cystic fibrosis have
also been described.
Results: In this manuscript we present the results of the analysis of the completely annotated
genome sequence of the B. petrii strain DSMZ12804. B. petrii has a mosaic genome of 5,287,950 bp
harboring numerous mobile genetic elements, including seven large genomic islands. Four of them
are highly related to the clc element of Pseudomonas knackmussii B13, which encodes genes involved
in the degradation of aromatics. Though being an environmental isolate, the sequenced B. petrii
strain also encodes proteins related to virulence factors of the pathogenic Bordetellae, including
the filamentous hemagglutinin, which is a major colonization factor of B. pertussis, and the master
virulence regulator BvgAS. However, it lacks all known toxins of the pathogenic Bordetellae.
Conclusion: The genomic analysis suggests that B. petrii represents an evolutionary link between
free-living environmental bacteria and the host-restricted obligate pathogenic Bordetellae. Its
remarkable metabolic versatility may enable B. petrii to thrive in very different ecological niches.

Background
The genus Bordetella comprises several human and animal
pathogens and nine species are currently described [see
Additional file 1]. Human-restricted B. pertussis and B. parapertussis cause whooping cough, whereas B. bronchiseptica
and B. avium are responsible for respiratory infections in
many mammals and birds, respectively [1-3]. Despite the
availability of vaccines, there are still 300,000 deaths/year
caused by B. pertussis and significant economic losses associated with infections in poultry and cattle. The genomes
of these Bordetellae were recently sequenced and analyzed
[4,5]. The genome sequence of B. avium revealed that it is
quite divergent from the mammalian pathogens. In contrast, the genomes of the human pathogens B. pertussis
and B. parapertussis showed that they are independent
derivatives of B. bronchiseptica-like ancestors. They both
underwent significant gene loss, probably mediated by
insertion sequence (IS) elements, during the process of
host adaptation, as indicated by their smaller genome
sizes compared to that of B. bronchiseptica and the presence of many pseudogenes. The evolution of humanadapted species is characterized by massive genome
reduction, lack of horizontal acquisition of genetic material and significant differences in virulence gene expression among species [4,6].
The type strain of the only environmental species of the
genus, B. petrii, was isolated from a dechlorinating bioreactor enriched by river sediment [7]. B. petrii strains were
repeatedly found in environmental samples, e.g. microbial consortia degrading aromatic compounds [8,9].
Recently, two B. petrii strains were isolated from patients

suffering from mandibular osteomyelitis and chronic suppurative mastoiditis [10,11]. Bacteria closely related to B.
petrii were also found in cystic fibrosis patients [12]. Moreover, B. petrii strains were also isolated from marine
sponges and a grass root consortium [13,14]. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the Bordetellae are closely
related to Achromobacter and Alcaligenes [see Additional
file 1] [2,7]. These environmental organisms occasionally
cause severe nosocomial infections and they are also isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis [15,16]. In addition to their medical relevance, these microorganisms also
have an intrinsic biotechnological interest, because they
show a remarkable capacity to degrade aromatic compounds and detoxify heavy metals [17,18].
Since B. petrii exhibits properties of host-associated and
environmental bacteria, it is important to perform a
genomic analysis of this bacterium in order to understand
the genetic basis of its versatility. The B. petrii genome provides insights into the evolutionary history of the Bordetellae, acting also as a spyglass to the Alcaligenes/
Achromobacter group for which, despite their biotechnological potential, no sequenced genomes are available yet.

Results and discussion
Genome features and comparative analysis
The general features of the Bordetella genomes are shown
in Table 1 and Figure 1. The genome of B. petrii has a similar size (5,287,950 bp) and coding-capacity (5,034
CDSs) to that of B. bronchiseptica (5,339,179 bp; 5,019
CDSs). The genomes of B. pertussis, B. parapertussis and B.
avium are much smaller, showing massive gene loss durPage 2 of 14

ing host-adaptation. The overall GC content (65.5%) of B.
petrii is intermediate between that of B. bronchiseptica
(68.08%) and B. avium (61.58%). B. petrii has 125 pseudogenes, less than B. pertussis (358) and B. parapertussis
(220), but more than B. bronchiseptica (18) and B. avium
(68).
The genomes of B. petrii and B. avium show lower similarity and synteny than those of mammalian-adapted Bordetellae, suggesting that they are most distantly related.
Reciprocal BLASTP analysis with other sequenced Bordetellae identified coding sequences unique to B. petrii (Figure 2) [4,5]. B. petrii, B. bronchiseptica and B. avium share
2,049 CDSs, which represent the Bordetella core gene set,
which was likely inherited from a common ancestor. B.
petrii shares more CDSs with B. bronchiseptica (2,884) than
with B. avium (2,229). Interestingly, B. petrii has 1,825
CDSs that are not present in either B. bronchiseptica or B.
avium. A large number of these B. petrii-unique CDSs
(1,157 CDSs and 188 genes encoding transposases) are
located on mobile elements and encode accessory metabolic functions (Table 2).
Mobile genetic elements – a mosaic genome
The most prominent feature that distinguishes B. petrii
from other Bordetellae is the presence of seven laterally
acquired genomic islands (GI1-GI7). The locations of
these GIs on the chromosome correlate with atypical GCcontent and GC-bias (Figure 1). These GIs have the characteristic features of mobile elements collectively known
as integrative and conjugative elements (ICE). Four of the
B. petrii GIs (GI1, GI2, GI3 and GI6) are related to the clc
element of Pseudomonas knackmussii B13, which codes for
proteins involved in the biodegradation of chloroaromatics [19]. The similarity between these four GIs and the clc
element is mostly confined to the conjugal transfer region
and varies substantially (42%–98%) between individual
genes within this region [see Additional file 2]. However,

among these GIs, GI3 is the most similar (78%–98%) to
the clc element and also carries all the chloroaromatic
degredation genes found in the clc element. Like the clc
element in B13, these four GIs are integrated into the 3'end of tRNAGly genes, are flanked by a 15–18 bp direct
repeat generated by the duplication of the 3'-end of tRNA,
and each encodes an integrase highly similar (88%, 69%,
100% and 52% amino acid identity) to that of the clc element (IntB13). GI1, GI2 and GI3 are located in close
proximity within a 510 kb region (Figures 1, 3). The clctype mobile elements are self transmissible and B. petrii
may have obtained them from environmental Pseudomonads, with which it shares habitat [20]. During the
conjugal transfer process, ICEs are excised from the chromosome and form a circular intermediate [21]. Interestingly, during in vitro culture the whole 510 kb region
encompassing GI1, GI2 and GI3 is deleted in a fraction of
the bacterial population. Sequence analysis of the deletion point revealed a regenerated 18 bp integration site
(Figure 3), indicating that these GIs are still active in terms
of excision from the chromosome. In fact, circular intermediates were detected for all GIs in B. petrii cells during
normal growth (Lechner and Gross, unpublished results).
The remaining GIs (GI4, GI5 and GI7) encode a conjugal
transfer system similar to the type IV secretion systems
associated with plasmids. GI4 is highly similar to Tn4371
of Ralstonia eutropha A5/Cupriavidus oxalaticus, a 55-kb
conjugative transposon that carries genes involved in the
degradation of biphenyl or 4-chlorobiphenyl [22]. The
features of all GIs are summarized in Table 2.
It has been previously reported that the chromosomes of
B. pertussis and B. parapertussis carry a large number of IS
elements (261 and 112, respectively). These IS elements
are responsible for the extensive shuffling and deletions in
their genomes [4]. In contrast, B. bronchiseptica and B.
avium carry none. B. petrii carries 105 IS elements, most of

which belong to the IS3-family. Interestingly, there are six
copies of IS1663 which was found in B. pertussis and one
truncated copy of IS1001 (Bpet1198) which was found in
B. parapertussis. The vast majority (66%) of the B. petrii IS
are located within GIs, whereas 34% are randomly dispersed around the chromosome. B. petrii also carries two

intact prophages (phage 1, Bpet0942-1008; phage 2,
Bpet4384-4432) (Figure 1), and phage-like particles were
indeed observed by electron microscopy of the sequenced
strain [7]. Phage 1 is inserted at the 3'end of a gene encoding a tRNAcys, while phage 2 is related to bacteriophage
Mu. In addition, there are several regions on the B. petrii

genome which may encode prophage remnants (Figure

carries four prophages, however, none of them is related
to the B. petrii phages.
The GIs (GI1-GI7), IS elements and prophages represent
22% of the B. petrii genome. This highly mosaic genome
structure reflects extensive DNA exchange and provides
first evidence for a considerable horizontal gene transferdriven evolution in the genus Bordetella.
Metabolism of B. petrii – genomic basis for metabolic
versatility
The central metabolic pathways are remarkably similar
between B. petrii and the pathogenic Bordetellae. For
instance, the glycolytic pathway is incomplete, lacking the
determinants for glucokinase and phosphofructokinase. B
petrii encodes all the enzymes needed for the TCA cycle
and for the synthesis of all essential nucleotides, cofactors,
amino acids and fatty acids. However, the in silico analysis
of the genome sequence of B. petrii suggests the presence
of a set of auxiliary pathways for the use of alternative
nutrients, such as gluconate, degraded plant products,

cyanate (as N-source), and various aromatic compounds
(see below), which may contribute to the ability of B.
petrii to thrive in different environments (Figure 4).
Gluconate is an intermediate in the degradation of sugar
acids and sugar derivatives, which are components of
more complex molecules, such as plant materials and secondary metabolites. The genome analysis of B. petrii suggests that this microorganism can also utilize gluconate
via a variant of the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway,
which is only found in few bacteria, such as Rhodobacter
sphaeroides, but absent in all the other sequenced Bordetellae [23]. In this pathway, gluconate is first transformed
by a gluconate dehydratase (Bpet3300) to 2-dehydro-3deoxy-D-gluconate, which is then imported into the cytoplasm via 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate permease
(Bpet1985) and phosphorylated to 2-dehydro-3-deoxyD-gluconate-6-phosphate by a 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate kinase (KdgK, Bpet0876). This compound is then
converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and pyruvate by
the action of 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate-6-phosphate aldolase (KdgA, Bpet0875). A IclR family transcription regulator (Bpet0874) is present immediately

upstream of the kdgA and kdgK genes suggesting that this
variant ED pathway may be inducible by this regulator
depending on the availability of the external carbon
source. In this regard, it is surprising that although a periplasmic glucose dehydrogenase (gcd, Bpet4644), which
converts glucose to gluconate, is encoded in the genome,
B. petrii is unable to metabolize glucose [7].
Interestingly, B. petrii encodes a protein (Bpet0241) with
significant similarity to pectate lyases, extracellular
enzymes secreted by phytopathogens, such as Erwinia
carotovora, which catalyze the cleavage of pectate [24-26].
The reaction products are channeled into the variant ED
pathway [27]. In agreement with this, the determinants
for two other important enzymes of these pathways, 2deoxy-D-gluconate
3-dehydrogenase
(Bpet0046,
Bpet1132) and altronate hydrolase (Bpet0414) are
present, indicating that B. petrii uses plant cell-wall constituents as nutrient sources, which is in line with the isolation of a B. petrii strain from a plant root consortium
[14]. The presence of a cyanate transporter (Bpet3878)
and a cyanate lyase (Bpet3621) catalyzing the decomposition of cyanate into ammonia and bicarbonate, suggests
that B. petrii is not only able to cope with the toxicity of
environmental cyanate, but like E. coli may use it as a
nitrogen source [28]. A striking difference between B.

petrii and the other Bordetellae is that it has a facultative
anaerobic energy metabolism and can utilize nitrate as the
terminal electron acceptor during anaerobic respiration
[7]. Accordingly, on its core genome B. petrii encodes the
factors (nitrate-, nitrite-, and nitrous oxide reductases)
necessary to carry out complete denitrification from
nitrate to N2. Interestingly, only some of the respective
genes are present in the pathogenic Bordetellae. B. bronchiseptica appears to encode a functional nitrate reductase,
while B. parapertussis has a truncated napD gene probably
leading to a non-functional nitrate reductase, and B. pertussis does not encode genes involved in denitrification at
all.
Metabolic talents of B. petrii – degradation of aromatic
compounds
The in silico analysis of the B. petrii genome revealed an
unusual metabolic capability regarding the degradation of
aromatic compounds summarized in Figure 5. For the
metabolisation of some of these compounds including
benzoate, phthalate, 3-hydroxybenzoate, 3-hydroxyphenylacetate and 4-hydroxyphenylacetate we have obtained
experimental evidence (data not shown).

A prominent feature is the presence of a surprisingly large
number of genes coding for enzymes of the chloroaro-

Overview of the degradation capacity of aromatic compounds by B. petrii
Figure 5
Overview of the degradation capacity of aromatic compounds by B. petrii. Aromatic compounds (boxed) are funneled through a variety of peripheral reactions (represented by arrows) into central intermediates, which are then processed
by a central pathway to TCA cycle intermediates. However, neither salicylate nor phenylacetate could be used by B. petrii as
sole source of carbon and energy (data not shown), probably due to the absence of a ferredoxin reductase encoding gene
within the salicylate 5-hydroxylase encoding gene cluster (Bpet2804-2806 cluster), and an incomplete paaZ gene in the phenylacetate catabolic gene cluster (Bpet 1923–1935). 4-hydroxyphenylacetate is used as sole source of carbon and energy (data
not shown), even though no gene with similarity to those encoding 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase was found in the
genome (see Methods for experimental details).

matic metabolism. One complete set of chlorocatechol
pathway genes (Bpet1533-1538) is localized on GI3
highly related to the clc element of Pseudomonas knackmussii B13. A second set of chlorocatechol pathway genes
(Bpet3747-3752) is located on GI5 and shows high similarity to genes identified in the 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene

degrading Pseudomonas strain P51 [29]. A third possible
chlorocatechol gene cluster encoding proteins only distantly related to those previously characterized is also
located on GI5. This multiplicity of chlorocatechol gene
clusters probably endows this strain with the ability to
effectively metabolize a broad range of differently substi-

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:449

tuted chlorocatechols, providing thereby a valuable competitive advantage to thrive in polluted environments [3032].
On GI5, chlorocatechol genes are preceded by a gene cluster (Bpet3738-3742) encoding a chlorobenzene dioxygenase and chlorobenzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase,
highly homologous to those of the 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene degraders Cupriavidus strain PS12 and Pseudomonas
strain P51 [33,34]. The absence of any linked extradiol
dioxygenase encoding gene suggests that similarly to what
is observed in the strains PS12 and P51, this cluster has
specifically evolved for the transformation of chlorobenzenes [29,30,35].
B. petrii also harbors four different central pathways for
aromatic metabolism via dihydroxylated central intermediates, the gentisate (Bpet0516-0517 and Bpet1429-1430,
the latter located on GI2), the homogentisate (Bpet 4016–
4017) and the catechol and protocatechuate branch of the
3-oxoadipate pathway (see below). Such versatility is similar to that observed in bacteria well known for their high
metabolic capabilities, such as P. putida KT2440 and Cupriavidus necator [36]. Only genes encoding enzymes of the
homogentisate pathway were detected in all other
sequenced Bordetellae, and those involved in the gentisate pathway are only present in B. avium.
Various natural aromatic compounds are known to be
degraded via either the catechol or the protocatechuate
branch of the 3-oxoadipate pathway, which thus plays a
key role in bacterial aromatic catabolism. This pathway is
widespread in Proteobacteria, however, all previously
sequenced Bordetella strains are devoid of complete pathways and only a catIJCD cluster (Bpet4528-4532) is
present as a remnant. In B. petrii, complete pathways are
formed by genes of the protocatechuate branch
(Bpet0260-0254) located in a genomic region with a quite
low GC content, but lacking other typical features of a
genomic island (named GI in Table 2 and in Additional
file 3), and two clusters localized on GI2, encoding the
enzymes of the catechol branch. We believe this to be the
first example of natural horizontal transfer of this central
aromatic metabolic pathway. Notably, also peripheral
pathways for funneling benzoate (Bpet1396-1399) and
benzylalcohol (Bpet1387-1388) to catechol are located
on GI2. A peripheral pathway for channeling phthalate to
protocatechuate (Bpet0248-0252) is located on GI1. The
low number of peripheral routes contrasts with the situation in other Proteobacteria, such as B. xenovorans LB400,
where five substrates are degraded via protocatechuate
[37].
A strategy of aerobic degradation of aromatics alternative
to the metabolism via dihydroxylated intermediates is ini-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/449

tiated by CoA ligases [38,39]. B. petrii carries gene clusters
required for the metabolism of all three substrates, which
are known to be degraded by such a strategy (Bpet05490554 for anthranilate metabolism and Bpet1924-1935 for
phenylacetate metabolism, which are present in other
Bordetellae, and Bpet3568-3575 for benzoate metabolism). As degradation via CoA derivatives needs less oxygen molecules compared to degradation via
dihydroxylated intermediates, this may provide B. petrii
with a selective advantage to also thrive in oxygen limited
environments. For an overview about the aromatic degradation capabilities of B. petrii see Figure 5 and Additional
file 3.
"Virulence factors" of B. petrii and host-restricted
Bordetellae
Pathogenic Bordetellae produce many surface associated
or secreted virulence factors [1]. B. petrii does not code for
the well-characterized toxins of classical Bordetellae (i.e.,
pertussis toxin, adenylate cyclase toxin and dermonecrotic
toxin). However, it produces a low amount (22–53 nM/
OD) of the non-protein tracheal cytotoxin (TCT), a spontaneously released muramylpeptide that disrupts epithelia [40]. This expression range is comparable to the
expression levels observed for the broad host range pathogen B. bronchiseptica.

Autotransporter or type V secretion proteins play a major
role in Bordetella virulence [1]. B. bronchiseptica encodes 21
autotransporter proteins, whereas B. petrii encodes only
four (Bpet0190, Bpet0193, Bpet3980, Bpet4156) [4]. Two
of them (Bpet0190 and Bpet0193) are paralogous and
show significant homology to the putative serine protease
autotransporter BB2301 of B. bronchiseptica, whereas the
other two do not show significant similarity to any database entry. Pathogenic Bordetellae also encode a two-partner secretion system which allows secretion of the
colonization factor filamentous hemagglutinin (FhaB)
[41]. This protein requires the FhaC protein for translocation across the outer membrane. B. petrii encodes proteins
related to FhaB and FhaC (Bpet600-601). B. petrii FhaB
has 3039 amino acids and its N-terminus, which is
required for export, is well-conserved with respect to pathogenic Bordetellae. However, the overall similarity with
FhaB of pathogenic Bordetellae is very low, being more
similar to putative secreted proteins of plant pathogens
(e.g., Ralstonia, Xylella and Burkholderia). This suggests that
the fha genes found in B. petrii and the pathogenic Bordetellae may not be orthologous.
Other protein secretion systems are differentially distributed among Bordetellae. In contrast to the mammalian
pathogens, B. petrii and B. avium lack type I and III protein
secretion systems, but encode a type II secretion system
(Bpet2855-2866 and BAV0331-0343). Type IV secretion

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:449

systems are either engaged in protein transport to the
extracellular medium or into eukaryotic cells, or they are
involved in DNA-transfer. There are three gene clusters in
B. petrii, which are associated with GIs and appear to
encode complete type IV secretion systems (Bpet22042215, Bpet3701-3719, Bpet4615-4626). None of these
systems appears to be related to the pertussis toxin exporting type IV system of B. pertussis, being probably involved
in conjugal DNA transfer.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/449

Therefore, B. petrii is endowed with several putative virulence factors for plant and animal hosts, such as adhesins
(e.g., Fha, fimbriae) and a master virulence regulator
(Bvg), but lacks Bordetella toxins. This suggests that pathogenic Bordetellae might have acquired their toxin genes
horizontally, while adapting to an obligate pathogenic
lifestyle. Alternatively, it is possible that toxin genes have
been lost from the B. petrii lineage.

Conclusion
The B. petrii genome carries three fimbrial gene clusters
(Bpet0111-0114, Bpet4129-4132 and Bpet4464-4468),
each encoding a major fimbrial subunit, a fimbrial assembly chaperone, an outer membrane usher protein and a
fimbrial adhesin. The chaperone and usher proteins have
significant sequence similarities with their counterparts in
the pathogenic Bordetellae, with e-values ranging from
6e-23 to 3e-35 for the chaperones and e-values ranging
from 3e-71 to 6e-103 for the usher proteins. In contrast,
the homology of the major structural proteins and fimbrial adhesins with the proteins of the pathogenic Bordetellae is very low (e-values > 1e-5). Similarly to B. avium,
B. petrii lacks the genes for the biosynthesis of
siderophores. However, it specifies 12 TonB-dependent
iron scavenging receptors, which may be important for
iron acquisition in soil and plant-associated environments.
Most virulence factors are coordinately regulated in pathogenic Bordetellae by a single master regulator, the BvgAS
two-component system [42,43]. This system consists of
two proteins, a response regulator (BvgA) and a multidomain histidine kinase (BvgS), consisting of a periplasmic
solute-binding domain, and, on the cytoplasmic side, of a
PAS, a transmitter, a receiver and an HPt domain.
Although the B. petrii BvgA (Bpet 4471) is highly homologous to the BvgA proteins of the pathogenic Bordetellae
(65% amino acid similarity), the structure of the B. petrii
equivalents of BvgS is more complex. First of all, there are
two histidine kinases, BvgS1 (Bpet4469) and BvgS2
(Bpet4472), with significant sequence similarities to BvgS.
BvgS1 contains a PAS, a transmitter and a receiver
domain, whereas BvgS2 contains a transmitter and a
receiver domain. In contrast to BvgS, both B. petrii proteins are devoid of a large periplasmic domain. The HPt
domain, which in pathogenic Bordetellae is part of the
multidomain BvgS protein, in B. petrii is an independent
protein (Bpet4470) (see Additional file 4. To see legends
for Additional files 1, 2 and 4 please see Additional file 5
). This suggests that during their evolution to pathogens,
the virulence regulatory system has been streamlined by
the omission of one histidine kinase and incorporation of
the HPt domain into the multidomain histidine kinase
BvgS.

The five sequenced Bordetella species, B. bronchiseptica, B.
pertussis, B. parapertussis, B. avium and B. petrii, represent
different states of environmental adaptation. These five
organisms have followed different evolutionary paths.
Evolution of the B. bronchiseptica-derived host restrictedpathogens B. pertussis and B. parapertussis was dominated
by substantial gene decay and loss. This might also hold
true for B. avium, which is characterized by a relatively
small genome containing 68 pseudogenes. In contrast, the
evolution of the environmental isolate B. petrii was dominated by horizontal acquisition of large genomic islands
expanding its metabolic capacities. B. bronchiseptica, with
a broad host range and the potential to survive in the environment, might represent an intermediate evolutionary
state. If the Bordetellae derive from a common environmental ancestor, B. petrii appears to be more closely
related to this ancestor than the pathogenic Bordetellae,
since it is the only true environmental isolate within the
genus, which is also found in association with host organisms. Moreover, B. petrii is the only facultative anaerobic
Bordetella species [7]. Since closely related Achromobacter
species are also facultative anaerobes, the common ancestor of the Bordetellae probably had a facultative anaerobic
energy metabolism. During adaptation to an obligate host
association, the genes for several metabolic functions, e.g.
those required for denitrification, may have been deleted
from the genomes of pathogenic Bordetellae, leaving just
a few remnants in the various species.

Methods
Whole genome shotgun sequencing
For the shotgun phase we produced 103,308 paired-end
sequences derived from three pTZ18R genomic libraries
(with insert sizes of 1 kb, 3 kb and 10 kb) yielding 11.72fold coverage, using dye terminator chemistry on ABI377
and MegaBACE 1000 automated sequencers. As a scaffold
we used 2,688 paired-end sequences pCC1BAC libraries
with insert sizes of 17–30 kb and 40–70 kb (leading to a
total coverage of 5.14-fold). Assembly of the paired-end
sequences was performed by PHRAP (P. Green, unpublished data; http://www.phrap.org/). The complete
genome sequence was finished by using the Staden package (GAP v4.8b1) [44]. Another 5,154 sequencing reads
were generated to close the remaining gaps and to polish
the sequence.

Genome analysis and annotation
Curation and annotation of the genome was done using
the genome annotation system GenDB [45]. A combined
gene prediction strategy was applied on the assembled
sequences using GLIMMER and CRITICA [46]. Putative
ribosomal binding sites and transfer RNA genes were
identified with RBSFINDER and tRNAscan-SE, respectively [47,48]. In a first step, automatic annotation was
computed based on various tools: similarity searches were
performed against different databases including SWISSPROT, TrEMBL, KEGG, Pfam, TIGRFAM and InterPro.
Furthermore, SignalP, helix-turn-helix and TMHMM were
applied. Additionally, each gene was functionally classified by assigning of a Cluster of Orthologous Groups
(COG) number and its corresponding COG category and
Gene Ontology numbers [49,50]. Finally, the annotation
of each predicted gene was manually inspected and
adjusted if necessary.
Genomic comparisons
For comparative analyses, the annotated genome
sequences of the following bacteria were imported into
the genome annotation system GenDB [45]: Bordetella
avium 197N (gb;AM167904), Bordetella pertussis Tohama I
Bordetella
parapertussis
12822
(gb;NC_002929),
Bordetella
bronchiseptica
RB50
(gb;NC_002928),
(gb;NC_002927). Similarity searches were conducted
against the genomes on the nucleotide and amino acid
sequence level by using BLASTN and BLASTP, respectively
[51]. Synteny plots were created with GenDB [45]. For the
determination of the core genome common to all
sequenced Bordetellae all the CDS were compared to each
other reciprocally using BLASTP with an e-value < 1e-20 as
a cut-off.
Detection of regions with atypical GC content
Genomic regions with atypical GC content were identified
using the 'sliding window' technique with a window size
of 3,000 bp and a step size of 1,000 bp. For this purpose,
the GC content was assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution and regions with at least 2.0 standard deviation
differences from the mean were determined.
Use of aromatic compounds as sole carbon source by B.
petrii
Growth experiments were carried out in a minimal
medium containing 10% salt solution (2.5 g NaCl, 0.5 g
KH2PO4, 0.2 g KCl, 0.1 g MgCl2 × H2O, 1.5 g Tris/HCl
resuspended in 100 ml distilled water), 1.8 μM CaCl2, 36
μM FeSO4 × H2O, 2 mM (NH4)SO4. Aromatic carbon
sources were added to final concentrations of 2–5 mM
each.
