Abstract
Background: Chloroplast genome sequences are extremely informative about speciesinterrelationships owing to its non-meiotic and often uniparental inheritance over generations. The
subject of our study, Fagopyrum esculentum, is a member of the family Polygonaceae belonging to
the order Caryophyllales. An uncertainty remains regarding the affinity of Caryophyllales and the
asterids that could be due to undersampling of the taxa. With that background, having access to
the complete chloroplast genome sequence for Fagopyrum becomes quite pertinent.
Results: We report the complete chloroplast genome sequence of a wild ancestor of cultivated
buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum ssp. ancestrale. The sequence was rapidly determined using a
previously described approach that utilized a PCR-based method and employed universal primers,
designed on the scaffold of multiple sequence alignment of chloroplast genomes. The gene content
and order in buckwheat chloroplast genome is similar to Spinacia oleracea. However, some unique
structural differences exist: the presence of an intron in the rpl2 gene, a frameshift mutation in the
rpl23 gene and extension of the inverted repeat region to include the ycf1 gene. Phylogenetic
analysis of 61 protein-coding gene sequences from 44 complete plastid genomes provided strong
support for the sister relationships of Caryophyllales (including Polygonaceae) to asterids. Further,
our analysis also provided support for Amborella as sister to all other angiosperms, but interestingly,
in the bayesian phylogeny inference based on first two codon positions Amborella united with
Nymphaeales.
Conclusion: Comparative genomics analyses revealed that the Fagopyrum chloroplast genome
harbors the characteristic gene content and organization as has been described for several other
chloroplast genomes. However, it has some unique structural features distinct from previously
reported complete chloroplast genome sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of the dataset, including
this new sequence from non-core Caryophyllales supports the sister relationship between
Caryophyllales and asterids.

Background
Chloroplasts are hypothesized to have evolved from
ancient endosymbiotic cyanobacteria. They are semiautonomous possessing their own genome that codes for
a set of proteins, which orchestrate the process of photosynthesis and other house-keeping functions. The nonmeiotic and mostly uniparental inheritance of chloroplast
genes render them as most informational entities in plant
phylogenetic studies. Technological enhancements and
consequent reduction of time in sequence capture have
enabled sequencing of several chloroplast genomes
recently. The discipline of plant phylogenetics has been
the largest beneficiary of these technological advances.
The phylogenetic trees derived from the analysis of whole
genome sequences are completely or near-completely
resolved, with highly supported nodes. Further, analysis
of chloroplast gene-evolution rates can be informative
about nodal support as recently demonstrated in Saxifragales where slow evolving genes from the chloroplast
inverted repeat region provided support for deep level
divergences [1]. Despite the availability of these datasets,
complete chloroplast genome sequence-based phylogenies are prone to artifacts caused by incomplete taxon
sampling [2-4]. Therefore, availability of complete chloroplast genome sequences from additional taxa is highly
desirable for robust phylogenetic studies.
This study reports the complete chloroplast genome
sequence from Fagopyrum esculentum ssp. ancestrale, a wild
ancestor of cultivated buckwheat [5]. This species belongs
to the family Polygonaceae. According to APGII [6] Polygonaceae is a member of the order Caryophyllales; however this family represents a separate group within it, the
so called non-core Caryophyllales [7] and sometimes it is
treated as a separate order, Polygonales [8]. Both phylogenetic and genomic studies are lacking for this group. In
addition, the affinities of the order Caryophyllales as a
whole also remain debatable. All chloroplast genome
sequence-based phylogenies obtained till date place
Spinacia (the only representative of Caryophyllales with a
known chloroplast genome sequence) as sister to asterids
(for example see [9,10]). Other studies incorporating
lesser number of genes but broader taxon sampling placed
them at the base of the clade which includes asterids and
rosids [6,11]. To validate if the sister relationship of Caryophyllales and asterids is due to taxon undersampling in
Caryophyllales, additional sequence information is
highly desirable. Therefore, inclusion of the buckwheat
chloroplast genome sequence in a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis is expected to aid in addressing the affinity issue of the Caryophyllales.
The sequence of Fagopyrum chloroplast genome, besides
its phylogenetic implications, may provide useful information for more practical aspects. Common buckwheat

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/59

(F. esculentum) is a widely cultivated multipurpose crop
[12]. Access to the chloroplast genome sequence may
highlight other physiologically important traits in buckwheat. In addition, the chloroplast genome sequence can
be utilized for developing species specific transformation
vectors (for review see [13,14]). Therefore, the knowledge
of the nucleotide sequence of buckwheat chloroplast
genome opens up an avenue for the application of plastid
genetic engineering to this plant.

Methods
Plant material
The seeds of Fagopyrum species used in this study were
obtained from All-Russia Research Institute of Legumes
and Groat Crops. Plant material for Persicaria, Rheum, Reynoutria and Coccoloba was obtained from Moscow State
University Botanical garden.
DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing
Total cellular DNA was isolated from fresh leaf tissue
using NucleoSpin Plant DNA kit (Macherey-Nagel) following manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplification
was performed on PTC-220 DNA Engine Dyad (MJ
Research) using Encyclo PCR kit (Evrogen JSC, Moscow,
Russia). For amplification, PCR conditions recommended
in [15], i. e. 35 cycles of touchdown PCR with the decrease
of annealing temperature from 55 to 50 deg C, were used.
For some primer pairs, PCR was performed with optimization of gradient PCR involving altered annealing temperatures. For Long PCR, extension was performed at 68
deg C for 5 – 7 minutes, depending on the expected
amplicon size. PCR products were purified using Gel
Extraction & PCR Cleanup Kit (Cytokine Ltd, S.Petersburg, Russia). Automated sequencing was performed on
ABI 3100 sequencer using the Big Dye Terminator v.3.1
sequencing kit (ABI, USA).
Sequencing strategy and primer design
The sequence of buckwheat chloroplast genome was
obtained using a PCR based approach, similar to the ASAP
method described earlier in [15]. The inverted repeat
region of the Fagopyrum chloroplast genome was amplified and sequenced with the ASAP primers; the large and
small single copy regions were amplified using PCR primers developed from the multiple alignment of known
chloroplast genome sequences of angiosperms (primers
are listed in Additional file 1). These universal primers
enabled amplification of the entire chloroplast genome of
Fagopyrum with overlapping PCR fragments ranging in
size from 0.5 to 9 kb. Long fragments had to be generated
due to a lack of sequence conservation in the aligned chloroplast genomes and few structural changes (for example,
in the IR-LSC and IR-SSC junctions). The larger fragments
were amplified and sequenced with taxon-specific primers

using a primer walking approach (complete list of taxonspecific primers is available in Additional file 2).
Contig assembly and annotation
Sequences generated from a primer pair were first aligned
using Blast 2 sequences (bl2seq) tool [16], available at
NCBI website to develop contigs which were then assembled using the BioEdit software [17]. Draft genome annotation was generated using the organelle annotation
package DOGMA [18]. The predicted annotations were
further verified using BLAST similarity search [19].
Phylogenetic analysis
For the phylogenetic analysis, a set of 61 protein-coding
genes derived from 44 chloroplast genomes was collected
(Table 1). The species included in the analysis represent
all major lineages of angiosperms for which the chloroplast genome sequences have been reported till date.

Gene sequences were parsed to detect frameshift mutations and edited when necessary. Sequences were translated into derived amino acid sequences, which were
further aligned using MUSCLE ver. 3.6 [20] followed by
manual correction. Nucleotide sequence alignment was
overlaid on the amino acid sequence alignment.
Phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony (MP)
method was performed using PAUP* ver. 4.0b8 [21].
Bayesian inference of phylogeny was explored using the
MrBayes program ver. 3.1.2 [22]. Alternative topologies
test was performed with the Tree-Puzzle program [23].
MP analysis involved a heuristic search using tree bisection and reconnection (TBR) branch swapping and 100
random addition replicates. Non-parametric bootstrap
analysis [24] was performed with 100 replicates with TBR
branch swapping. Both nucleotide and amino acid
sequences were included in the analysis.
Bayesian analysis was also performed using both amino
acid and nucleotide sequence datasets. For nucleotide
sequence analyses different partitioning strategies were
employed: each gene as a separate partition (61 partitions), combination of genes according to their function
(4 partitions: photosynthetic metabolism, photosynthetic
apparatus, gene expression and others) and partitioning
according to codon position (3 partitions). For each of the
61 amino acid partitions, the most appropriate model of
substitutions was determined by the BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) in Modelgenerator ver. 0.43 [25]. Similarly for each nucleotide partition, the most appropriate
model of nucleotide substitution was determined by the
AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) in Modeltest ver. 3.7
[26].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/59

Bayesian analysis was performed with three chains in each
of the two runs. Each chain started with a random tree,
2500000 replicates for amino acid data and 5000000 replicates for nucleotide data were generated. The trees thus
obtained were sampled every 100 generations. The proportion of invariable sites and the shape of gamma-distribution rates were unlinked across partitions. The number
of discarded trees was determined using convergence diagnostics.

Results and Discussion
Overall structure and gene content of buckwheat
chloroplast genome
The GenBank accession number for the nucleotide
sequence reported in this study is EU254477. Complete
chloroplast genome of Fagopyrum esculentum ssp. ancestrale is composed of 159599 nucleotide bases. This exceeds
the average size of flowering plants chloroplast genomes
~155 Kb and, in particular, almost 9 Kb larger then the
chloroplast genome of its closest relative Spinacia oleracea
(150725 bp). The observed increase in size is due to the
expansion of the inverted repeat (IR) region. The size of
the IR region is 30684, the large single copy (LSC) and the
small single copy (SSC) regions are 84888 and 13343 bp
respectively. Overall AT-content of the entire plastome is
62%, the LSC and SSC are 63% and 68% AT respectively
and inverted repeat is 59% AT rich. This is comparable
with the other land plant chloroplast genomes (Spinacia
oleracea – 63%, Nicotiana sylvestris – 62%, Lotus japonicus –
64%, Zea mays – 62%). The lower AT% of the IR region
reflects the lower AT-content of ribosomal RNA genes.

The gene order and content of the buckwheat chloroplast
genome is identical to that of Spinacia (Fig. 1). This similarity is discernible not only in the functional genes but
also in the pseudogenes. In both buckwheat and Spinacia
chloroplast genome, the sequences representing rpl23 and
ycf15 genes are interrupted by the internal stop codons,
indicating their pseudogene status. The latter situation is
quite commonly observed amongst angiosperms: detailed
studies of the evolutionary pattern of this region have
revealed that ycf15 gene is not a protein-coding gene [27].
On the contrary, rpl23 gene is known to be present and
functional in most flowering plants [28]. Therefore, pseudogenization of this gene may represent a feature that is
unique to caryophyllids. Thus far, four sequences of the
rpl23 region have been reported for caryophyllids; beet
(Beta vulgaris), spinach, buckwheat and Silene latifolia,
(Caryophyllaceae). Comparative analysis of the four
sequences reveals that all of them harbor mutations; however their exact structure is different (Additional file 3). In
buckwheat there is a 4 bp insertion, which affects the reading frame, leading to the generation of a stop codon. Beta
and Spinacia share a common 14 bp deletion, which also
alters the reading frame. Interestingly in Silene this region

Gene map of the Fagopyrum esculentum chloroplast genome

seems to be less affected. It does not harbor any frameshift
mutations however the gene has a stop codon near the 5'end. This observation cannot serve as the sole evidence for
this gene being non-functional as a stop codon can be
edited to a sense codon by the commonly observed phenomenon of RNA editing in the chloroplasts. A sequencing artifact could be the other plausible explanation for
the presence of the stop codon. To evaluate if the pseudogenization of rpl23 gene is a common structural feature of
caryophyllid plastomes, additional sequence information

from other species is required. Transcription of the rpl23
gene has been experimentally demonstrated in spinach
however protein products were not detected in this study
[29]. Therefore it is plausibly an expressed pseudogene. A
similar situation may exist in the case of buckwheat as
well.
Another feature that is shared between Fagopyrum and
Spinacia plastomes is the presence of two genes – psbL and
ndhD – with an ACG initiation codon. C to U RNA edit-

ing-mediated creation of the AUG initiation codon from
the original ACG codon is a common phenomenon
observed in case of chloroplast genome-derived transcripts. RNA editing has been experimentally demonstrated for psbL [30] and ndhD genes in tobacco. The
editing of ndhD gene has also been reported in spinach
and snapdragon [31]. Since psbL and ndhD genes code for
proteins essential for chloroplast function, it is safe to
assume that their transcripts are edited in Fagopyrum. This
can be substantiated with the help of cDNA sequencing or
other experimental evidence in future studies. Interestingly, there are two structural features that are unique to
the Fagopyrum plastome. First is the position of the IR-SSC
borders relative to other plastid genomes. In Spinacia the
IRa/SSC border resides with in the 3' region of ycf1 gene.
The remaining ycf1 gene lies in the SSC; a copy of the
3'region of ycf1 gene located in the IRb produces the ycf1
pseudogene at the IRb/SSC border. Buckwheat possesses
an expanded IR region and two full-length copies of ycf1
gene are thus generated.
Second, buckwheat plastid genome is comprised of 18
intron-containing genes compared to spinach in which
the number of these genes is reduced to 17. This difference
is due to the loss of rpl2 intron in spinach [32]. The loss of
intron in rpl2 gene has occurred independently in several
lineages of flowering plants [33] and it is considered to be
a characteristic feature observed in the members of the
core Caryophyllales. Thus, the presence of the rpl2 intron
in buckwheat (Polygonaceae) emphasizes the distinction
of this group from the core Caryophyllales. The rpl2 intron
has also been reported in Rumex, another representative of
Polygonaceae, and in the members of Plumbaginaceae, a
family that is close to Polygonaceae and often associated
with Caryophyllales [33].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/59

The sequence information generated in the present study
confirms the expansion of the IR in Fagopyrum esculentum
ssp. ancestrale. In contrast to most angiosperms, the
expansion encompasses the ycf1 gene a conserved chloroplast ORF found in all known dicot and some monocot
chloroplast genomes. Its exact function is unknown but
together with another conserved chloroplast ORF ycf2, it
has been shown to be vital for chloroplast function in
tobacco [38]. In most instances, the IR region contains
only a part of the ycf1 gene with the other part located in
the SSC region of the plastome. The length of ycf1 gene
that is duplicated ranges from 156 bp in Nymphaea to
1583 bp in Amborella [27]. However, inclusion of the ycf1
gene in the IR region was also reported in a monocot
Lemna minor [39], in an asterid Jasminum nudiflorum [40]
and Ipomoea purpurea [41]. Given that these taxa belong to
diverse lineages of flowering plants, the expansion of ycf1
gene has most probably appeared independently in each
of these groups from an ancestral Amborella-like chloroplast genome. Moreover, the exact mode of ycf1 gene
expansion varies in different species (Fig. 2). For example,
in Jasminum the IR/SSC border is positioned within the
ycf1-ndhF spacer region on one border and the other border is positioned within the rps15-ycf1 spacer. In Lemna
the duplication encompasses rps15 gene and 5' region of
the ndhH gene. In Ipomoea this expansion extends even
further and includes the complete ycf1 gene, rps15 gene,
ndhH gene, and a short region of ndhA gene's first exon. In
case of buckwheat the expanded region includes the ycf1ndhF spacer and 70 bp of the 3' end of ndhF gene.

Expansion of the inverted repeat region in buckwheat
chloroplast genome
The size and thus the boundary of the chloroplast genome
inverted repeat (IR) region is variable amongst different
plant species [34]. Previous studies on IR borders have
mainly focused on the IR and the LSC junction [34,35]
that revealed multiple instances of expansion and contraction in the IR region, ranging from a few base pairs to
more than 15 Kb.

It is interesting to note that the sequence of the expanded
region in Fagopyrum esculentum ssp. ancestrale is different
from the sequence reported by Aii et al. [37]. The authors
had reported a 3711 bp inversion within this region. This
inversion affected the transcriptional continuity of ycf1
gene, causing an interruption in its reading frame. The
observed difference in the sequence reported in this study
could be plausibly explained by the use of different genotypes of buckwheat. However, the reported inversion
could be potentially employed for tracing the origin of
various buckwheat cultivars. Importantly, the set of buckwheat-specific primers reported in this work are expected
to enable future studies of this and other potentially interesting structural features.

The expanded IR region in buckwheat represents an average increase of 5 Kb when compared with other flowering
plants. The observed expansion and the sequence of the
enhanced IR region in other Fagopyrum species has been
reported previously [36,37]. This region was shown to be
highly similar to the small single copy (SSC) region adjacent to IRa in other dicot chloroplast genomes which enabled the conclusion that this expansion is due to the
inclusion of the SSC sequences.

We further investigated the expansion of the IR in other
species related to Fagopyrum esculentum spp. ancestrale
using a PCR based approach with two sets of primers (for
details see Additional file 4). One primer in each set
annealed to the ndhF and rps15 genes within the SSC. The
other primer is common to both sets and anneals to the
ycf1 gene. It has only one annealing site within the SSC in
chloroplast genomes that do not possess the IR expansion
(e. g., Spinacia), but two annealing sites (in the direct and

Structure of IRb/SSC and SSC/IRa in Amborella and in angiosperms with expanded IR. In Amborella IR/SSC junction occurs within ycf1; truncated copy of ycf1 is thus generated at the IRb/SSC border. Such organisation of IR/SSC junction is
characteristic for most angiosperms. Lemna, Ipomoea, Jasminum and Fagopyrum represent different ways of the IR expansion.
Jasminum and Fagopyrum both have included ycf1 in the IR. In Lemna not only ycf1, but also rps15 and a part of ndhH belong to
the IR, and in Ipomoea overall ndhH and a part of ndhA are also duplicated.

reverse orientations) in the IR of the species which have
two copies of ycf1 due to the IR expansion (like
Fagopyrum).
These studies revealed that the observed expansion of the
IR was present in all Polygonaceae members sampled in
the study that included two additional buckwheat species
examined besides F. esculentum (F. tataricum and F. homotropicum). Similar IR expansion was observed in Persicaria,
Rheum, Reinoutria and Coccoloba species as well (Fig. 3).

For buckwheat species the expansion of the IR was further
confirmed by sequencing of the IRb/SSC and SSC/IRa borders (accession numbers EU272335 – EU272336 for F.
tataricum and EU272337 – EU272338 for F. homotropicum). Thus from these studies it is clear that the expansion
is not only a characteristic of Fagopyrum, but also for some
other related genera and this may represent a common
feature of Polygonaceae. Comparative analysis of the various sequences derived from buckwheat species revealed
minor variations in the fine structure of the IR/SSC bor-

tively after the exclusion of ambiguous alignment positions.
Maximum parsimony (MP) analyses of all aligned nucleotide positions resulted in a single fully resolved tree, in
which most of the nodes gained high support in bootstrap
analyses (Fig. 4) except for the placement of Chloranthus.
MP analysis of amino acid data also produced a single
tree, but its topology was different for the placement of

boothstrap support of 100%), Cucumis (it forms a cluster
with Morus with a bootstrap support of 64%), Platanus

Chloranthus (sister to magnoliids with low bootstrap support).

der. In F. esculentum and F. homotropicum SSC/IR borders
are identical and lie within the ndhF gene (IRb/SSC) and
2 bp upstream of the rps15 gene (SSC/IRb). Overall the
rps15-ycf1 spacer region is included in the IR in the abovementioned species while in F. tataricum rps15 gene and 21
bp of rps15-ycf1 intergenic spacer region are located in the
SSC. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of nuclear and
chloroplast loci F. esculentum and F. homotropicum are
closely related to each other [42,43]. The fine structure of
IR/SSC borders in these species is consistent with these
data and further studies of this region can be of utility to
illustrate additional phylogenetic relationships within
Fagopyrum.
Phylogenetic analysis
In order to determine the relative position of Fagopyrum
amongst angiosperms comparative phylogenetic analyses
of available plastid genome sequences was performed.
The data set consisted of 61 concatenated protein-coding
gene sequences from 44 different taxa, including two gymnosperm species as outgroups. Nucleotide and amino acid
data sets contained 42504 and 14168 characters respec-

The topologies of the Bayesian trees derived from the partitioned nucleotide matrix and amino acid sequence analyses were identical (Fig. 5) regardless of the chosen
partitioning scheme. Exclusion of the third codon position from the Bayesian analysis resulted in a similar tree
with the exception of Amborella uniting with Nymphaeales.
It has been demonstrated previously that the partitioning
of complex datasets greatly improves the performance of
Bayesian inference [44-46]. Thus, we employed different
partitioning schemes (61 partitions, 4 partitions and 3
partitions) in our analyses however, comparison of the
resulting trees showed no difference in the resulting tree
topologies. At the same time dividing the dataset into 3
partitions seemed more logical if harmonic means of marginal likelihoods were compared (-455638.67, 455391.40, -449073.19 for 61, 4 and 3 partitions, respectively).
In general, our inferred chloroplast phylogenies are very
similar to recently published molecular trees, in which the
interrelationships and the monophyly of magnoliids,
monocots and eudicots were strongly supported
[9,10,47,48]. In all the derived phylogenetic trees,
Fagopyrum and Spinacia (both represent Caryophyllales
sensu lato) form a sister clade to asterids. To determine if
alternative topologies with placement of Caryophyllales
as a sister group to rosids (AT1) or to rosids and asterids
(AT2) can be distinguished, a Shimodaira-Hasegawa test
[49] was conducted and expected-likelihood weights [50]
were calculated using RELL optimization [51]. According
to the results of these tests, the alternative placement of
Caryophyllales is significantly worse than the optimal
topology, supporting a close relationship of Caryophyllales and asterids (p < 0.001, c<0.001 for both AT1 and
AT2).

A clade of rosids, with grape being basal among them, is
sister to asterids and Caryophyllales. Notably in our dataset inclusion of Morus sequence leads to stabilization of
Cucumis position and in all our analyses the eurosids I are
monophyletic. In the most recently published phylogenetic trees based on chloroplast sequences, the placement
of Cucumis was unstable. It either united with Myrtaceae
(Eucalyptus, Oenothera) in the bayesian trees or nested
within eurosids I in the MP trees [9,47,52]. A close relationship of Morus and Cucumis has been demonstrated
previously [53] and in our Bayesian trees these species
form a cluster with a high posterior probability value.
Such grouping is questionable based on our MP analysis
and a previously reported analysis of 64 plastid genomes
[10] that place them as a grade. However, it is obvious that
eurosids I may be considered monophyletic.
Ranunculus and Nandina appear to constitute the basal
most clade within eudicots. Buxus is the closest ally to core
eudicots in all the derived trees, whereas the position of
Platanus among basal eudicots cannot be firmly determined. Its intermediate position is not supported in the
MP analysis with bootstrap resampling of amino acid
sequences.
Amborella, Nymphaeales, Chloranthales and magnoliids
remain the most problematic groups in angiosperm phylogeny. Their phylogenetic relationships are still equivocal
and are dependent on the method and data used during
analyses. None of the alternative hypotheses concerning
Amborella (a sister to Nymphaeales or to all other
angiosperms) and Chloranthus (a sister to magnoliids only
or to magnoliids, monocots and eudicots) can be rejected
on the basis of phylogenetic analysis of the chloroplast
genome sequences [9,10]. Obviously, limited taxon sampling is the first weakness of the chloroplast phylogeny
analyses at the current stage, therefore the problem cannot
be resolved until additional representatives from basal
angiosperms and gymnosperms are included in the analyses to obtain robust relationships. The same holds true
for monocots and eudicots as long as many important lineages are missing. One should not be deluded by high
bootstrap or posterior probability values, because high
support for a doubtful clade is often obtained when a very
large number of characters (like whole chloroplast
genome sequences) but small number of taxa are used in
phylogenetic analysis. For example, Calycanthus in some
trees was placed as a sister to eudicots with high or moderate support [53-57] until additional magnoliids were
included in the analyses [47]. To overcome the issue of
taxon sampling, it is worth identifying genes that are most
efficient for phylogenetic analysis and then to analyze
these genes in more taxa. Recently RPO genes, coding for
plastid RNA-polymerase subunits, have been shown to
generate the topology of a phylogenetic tree similar to the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/59

whole plastid genomes phylogeny [58]. Another example
is the use of slowly evolving genes encoded in the chloroplast inverted repeat region that have helped to resolve
phylogenetic relationships within Saxifragales [1].
Distribution of ACG initiation codon in rpl2, psbL and
ndhD genes in angiosperms in the phylogenetic context
Several chloroplast genes in angiosperm plastomes are
known to possess an atypical initiation codon ACG. For
some species (tobacco, snapdragon, spinach, maize) there
is strong experimental evidence that this codon is edited
to the standard AUG codon [30,31,59] suggesting that
similar mechanism may exist in other species. Since RNA
editing patterns are thought to be the subjects of extensive
parallel evolution, they are not necessarily phylogenetically informative [60]. However, for three plastid genes –
rpl2, psbL and ndhD – a correlation between RNA editing
and phylogeny has been reported [61]. This study was
based on sequences from 7 angiosperms plastomes; it was
concluded that RNA editing in psbL gene emerged in a
common ancestor of angiosperms that was then lost in
monocots. Editing of rpl2 gene emerged only in monocots
and for ndhD gene it was observed only in dicots [61].

The availability of a large number of complete chloroplast
genome sequences from angiosperms and improved
knowledge about flowering plant phylogeny allows reevaluation of this conclusion. We performed a survey of
the potential RNA editing sites in the initiation codons of
rpl2, psbL and ndhD in 44 seed plant chloroplast genomes
sequenced till date (including Fagopyrum) and studied its
distribution in different evolutionary lineages using phylogenetic trees reported in this article as a framework
(Additional file 5). Foremost, our analyses indicate that
among seed plants the ACG initiation codon in rpl2 gene
is not only a characteristic of monocots, but also of some
early divergent angiosperms (Amborella, Chloranthus and
magnoliids) and lower eudicots (Ranunculales and Platanus). However, it is absent in Illicium and Nymphaeales
that are also the representatives of basal lineages of
angiosperms. Thus, it is difficult to conclude that the RNA
editing at this site emerged in a common ancestor of
angiosperms and then was lost in Illicium and Nymphaeales. Alternatively, it may have evolved later, after the
divergence of the members of ANITA grade and its occurrence in Amborella may be due to parallel evolution. The
editing in ndhD gene seemed to have evolved in a common ancestor of angiosperms and then lost in Nymphaea
and in some monocots. In all the grasses studied till date
ndhD gene has a standard ATG initiation codon [62-65]
suggesting that it may be common for all the members of
this family. The pattern of distribution of the ACG initiation codon in psbL gene is more complex. Its presence is
characteristic for most of the early divergent angiosperms
(except for Chloranthus and Calycanthus), but absent in all

BMC Plant Biology 2008, 8:59

sampled monocots and in several different lineages of
eudicots. We assume that the presence of the ACG initiation codon (and, presumably, RNA editing) in this gene is
an ancestral character state for angiosperms and its
absence is due to multiple parallel losses. However this
observation needs to be verified further using broader
taxon sampling.

Conclusion
Complete sequence of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum
ssp. ancestrale) chloroplast DNA has been generated using
a PCR based approach validating the utility of this
approach especially for non-rearranged angiosperm chloroplast genomes. This represents the first sequenced plastid genome of the family Polygonaceae and of non-core
Caryophyllales. Gene content and order of buckwheat
plastome is similar to that of Spinacia oleracea, its relative
from core Caryophyllales. However two structural differences have been revealed. First of them is the presence of
an intron in rpl2 gene and the second is the expansion of
inverted repeat region. The exact structure of the expanded
region is different from previously reported data and
includes an intact ORF for the ycf1 gene.
Phylogenetic analysis of 61 protein-coding genes in 44
taxa, including newly obtained chloroplast genome
sequence (Fagopyrum) provides strong support for the sister relationships of Caryophyllales sensu lato (including
Polygonaceae) and asterids. Most of other conclusions
from previous phylogenetic studies of chloroplast
genomes are also confirmed, in particular the placement
of Amborella (or Amborella + Nymphaeales) as a basalmost
angiosperm, sister relationships of Chloranthus and magnoliids and the position of Ranunculales (Ranunculus +
Nandina) as the earliest diverging lineage of eudicots.
The study of distribution of the potential RNA editing
sites in the initiation codon of rpl2, psbL and ndhD genes
in angiosperms reveals some correlations with the phylogeny though confirms that the evolution of RNA editing is
a subject of extensive parallel changes.
