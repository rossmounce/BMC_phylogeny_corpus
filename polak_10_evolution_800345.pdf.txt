The evolution of transcription-associated biases of
mutations across vertebrates

Abstract
Background: The interplay between transcription and mutational processes can lead to particular mutation patterns
in transcribed regions of the genome. Transcription introduces several biases in mutational patterns; in particular it
invokes strand specific mutations. In order to understand the forces that have shaped transcripts during evolution, one
has to study mutation patterns associated with transcription across animals.
Results: Using multiple alignments of related species we estimated the regional single-nucleotide substitution
patterns along genes in four vertebrate taxa: primates, rodents, laurasiatheria and bony fishes. Our analysis is focused
on intronic and intergenic regions and reveals differences in the patterns of substitution asymmetries between
mammals and fishes. In mammals, the levels of asymmetries are stronger for genes starting within CpG islands than in
genes lacking this property. In contrast to all other species analyzed, we found a mutational pressure in dog and
stickleback, promoting an increase of GC-contents in the proximity to transcriptional start sites.
Conclusions: We propose that the asymmetric patterns in transcribed regions are results of transcription associated
mutagenic processes and transcription coupled repair, which both seem to evolve in a taxon related manner. We also
discuss alternative mechanisms that can generate strand biases and involves error prone DNA polymerases and reverse
transcription. A localized increase of the GC content near the transcription start site is a signature of biased gene
conversion (BGC) that occurs during recombination and heteroduplex formation. Since dog and stickleback are known
to be subject to rapid adaptations due to population bottlenecks and breeding, we further hypothesize that an
increase in recombination rates near gene starts has been part of an adaptive process.
Background
The double stranded structure of the DNA molecule and
the Watson-Crick base pairing couples mutation processes on both strands. Every base X, on one strand pairs
with just one complementary base X' on the other strand:
G pairs with C and A with T. A mutation X→FY on the
forward strand is copied to a mutation X'→RY' on the
reverse strand. This is done either by repair enzymes that
ensure the right base pairing of the DNA or during replication, if the mutation of one strand is not recognized by
such enzymes. As a consequence, the rate of substitutions
X→FY of nucleotides X, Y on the forward strand, denoted
by [X→Y]F, is equal to the rate of the complementary
bases, X' and Y' on the reverse strand: [X→Y]F =

[X'→Y']R. Under the assumption that mutations occur
randomly on both strands and that the repair processes
are equally effective on both strands we further have that
[X→Y]F =[X→Y]R and therefore [X→Y]F =[X'→Y']F, i.e.
that complementary substitutions occur with the same
rate on one strand [1]. However this assumption and the
symmetry of the substitution rates are not granted, since
other cellular processes like transcription can distinguish
the two strands. The signature of transcription associated
substitution patterns is a particular substitution asymmetry in template and non-template strand [2,3] where the
ratio [X→Y]/[X'→Y'] is different from one. Henceforth,
rates will be calculated on the non-template strand, we
therefore drop the subscripts F and R.
In bacteria and mammals, the process of transcription
coupled repair (TCR) [4,5] can lead to strand asymmetries [6]. Additionally in Escherichia coli, cytosine deamination rates on the non-template strand are increased as
a consequence of single strand DNA (ssDNA) formation

of this strand during transcription [7-9]. In yeast, there is
also a direct link between transcription and mutations
occurring during recombination, which in turn is associated with transcription in this organism [10,11]. Recombination is positively correlated with higher fixation rates
of strong nucleotides (S = G or C that form three hydrogen bonds with each other) over weak ones (W = A or T
that form two hydrogen bounds with each other) [12].
Consequently the mutational signature of recombination
is not a strand asymmetry, but rather an excess of substitutions of weak bases in strong bases over the reverse
[13]. Similarly, cytosine methylation levels are positively
correlated with CpG deamination rates [CpG→CpA/
TpG] [14]. The association of transcription with repair,
recombination and mutagenesis, has also been suggested
in multi cellular organisms [2,15,16]. However, it has
been technically very hard to study these associations at a
genome wide level, since mutations occur at very low
rates.
Comparative genomics between distantly related species is currently one of the strongest tools to study the
impact of transcription on mutation patterns. The rate of
substitutions, in particular genomic loci, is determined by
regional mutagen levels, repair efficiency and selection.
However, in regions that are presumably neutrally evolving, the estimated substitution rates are considered to be
a good approximation of the actual mutation patterns.
The increasing amount of sequenced genomes, and their
corresponding alignments, allows estimating substitution
rates in a large variety of species, with increasing resolution.
Previously, we investigated the substitution patterns
along the non-template strand in 10 kbp regions centered
on the transcriptional start site (TSS) and the 3'end of
human genes [17]. Our analysis has revealed that five out
of six possible symmetries between complementary single-base substitutions are broken in human intronic
regions [17]. The next question is whether the substitution patterns associated with transcription in humans are
different from those in non-human species? Since the
average base composition of introns in different taxa are
not uniform, the answer might be positive [18,19] and
implies that mutational processes coupled to transcription vary across taxa.
In this work, we provide a comprehensive study of substitution patterns along genes and their flanking regions
in ten vertebrate species of the four taxa: primates,
rodents, laurasiatheria and bony fish. We have used a
sliding window analysis to study the different substitution
rates as a function of the distance from the 5'end and
3'end of genes. The inferred rates maximize the likelihood that all sites in a given multiple alignment are evolving according to a sequence evolution model, which is a
continuous time Markov model. Our model provides lin-

eage specific substitution rates, allowing us to address
questions about the evolution of these rates. This model
does not assume that the genomic base composition is at
equilibrium (or stationary). Therefore, using the estimated lineage specific rates and under the assumption
that the genomic regions will continue to evolve accordingly, we can estimate the future nucleotide compositions
along genes in all lineages (which are not directly connected to the root of the tree). The resulting stationary
base composition represents the expected content of As,
Ts, Cs and Gs at equilibrium. According to this, in mammalian intronic regions, we found an excess of Ts and Gs
over As and Cs in the stationary state. This deduced distribution is similar to the current nucleotide composition,
suggesting that the current strand asymmetry have been
generated by asymmetries in substitution rates.
Our analysis has revealed that strand asymmetries vary
significantly between mammalian and fish genes. We also
investigated the substitution patterns that impact the
weak (W) and strong (S) base composition of the
genomes. We found that the ratio of the substitution
rates, [W→S] over [S→W] increases towards the 5'end of
vertebrate genes. We show that this increase in [W→S]/
[STW] ratio is a consequence not only of a drop in CpG
methylation-deamination rates [CpG→TpG/CpA] near
the TSS, but also of another force that we speculate to be
biased gene conversion. Furthermore, the stationary GC
content (GC*) profiles peak near the TSS, although it
does not exceed 50% in most species, while the current
GC content is about 60%. Since a spike of GC content is a
hallmark of TSSs in mammalian species, it is surprising
that the mutational pressure implies a lower GC* than the
current GC content in most mammals. However, in dogs
GC* is higher than the current GC content, so regions
surrounding the TSS become even richer in GC content.
In sticklebacks, the average GC content frequency near
the TSS is lower than 0.5, but the mutational forces imply
GC* > 0.6. Hence, dog and stickleback are exceptions of
expanding GC content near the TSS while in all other
vertebrate species the GC content is decreasing.

Results
We estimated substitution rates along genes and their 5
kb upstream and downstream flanking regions. In order
to test for strand dependency of substitutions, we calculated the ratios between complementary transition rates
along the non-template strand. In vertebrate genomes,
the methylation levels are low in CpG islands [20], which
lead to low methylation-deamination rates in these loci.
Therefore, the analysis of mutational patterns was carried
out separately for gene-promoters overlapping with CpG
islands (CGI-genes) and for the rest of the genes (nonCGI-genes). As we previously reported, in general, strand
asymmetries associated to transcription can be divided

Polak et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:187

into global patterns that are detected along the whole
transcribed region and local patterns where the asymmetry is restricted to the first 1-2 kbp of the transcript [17].
Strand asymmetries are similar among mammals and
stronger in CGI-genes

Previously, we have found that the ratio [A→G]/[T→C]
along the 5 kb region downstream to the TSS and 5 kbp
upstream to the 3'end is larger than one and relatively
constant along the analyzed transcribed regions [17]; we
denote this pattern as a "global pattern" as it is detected
along the whole transcript. In addition to this global pattern there is a localized pattern, where [C→T]/[G→A] is
greater than one only along the first 1-2 kb of transcripts,
while the ratio is close to one outside of this region [17].
Similarly, in this work we find the global [A→G]/[T→C]
and the local [C→T]/[G→A] asymmetries in all mammals. Yet the global [A→G]/[T→C] asymmetry seems to
decline towards the 3'ends of transcripts (Figure 1). And
as observed previously in human, the "global" asymmetries extend into the intergenic regions downstream to

Page 3 of 12

genes [17]. Additionally, upstream to the TSS in CGIgenes, there is an opposite strand asymmetry where
[A→G]/[T→C] < 1 [17], while in nonCGI-genes, the
rates are either equal, as seen in primates and rodents, or
greater than one as in laurasiatheria. Across mammals
the global and local asymmetries are significantly more
pronounced in CGI-genes than in nonCGI-genes. This
implies that similar CGI-linked processes in mammals
are causative for the more pronounced patterns in CGIgenes (Figure 1).
In addition to the breaking of the strand symmetry of
transition rates, three out of four of the transversion rate
pairs are not equal to each other (Additional file 1 and
Additional file 2). In intronic regions of all mammalian
species that were analyzed in this study, the ratios
[G→T]/[C→A], [C→G]/[G→C] and [A→T]/[T→A] are
greater than one. These three asymmetries begin at the
5'end of genes and extend beyond the 3'end of genes as we
observed previously for the global pattern i.e. the profile
of [A→G]/[T→C] (Figure 1). In mammalian upstream
intergenic regions we have found that the direction of

correspond to the four taxa analyzed in this study and the columns to the two types of ratios between complementary transition frequencies. Each
panel consists of two sections: The left section is centered on the TSSs (left 0 k) and refers to 5 kbp of intergenic region upstream to the TSS and extends
towards 5 kbp of intronic region downstream to the TSS. The right section on a panel is similarly centered on the 3'ends (right 0 k), while the analyzed
regions extend from 5 kbp of intronic regions (upstream to the 3'end) to 5 kbp of intergenic regions downstream to the genes 3' ends. The ratios are
plotted against the distance from the 5' and 3'ends of genes. Ratios are calculated along the non-template strand from pooled 200 bp windows of
genes annotated for the reference species in each taxon. For CGI-genes the ratios are presented by thick lines, for nonCGI-genes ratios as thin lines.

asymmetries switches at CGI-genes i.e. [C→G]/[G→C]
and [A→G]/[T→C] are greater than one downstream to
the TSS and lower than one upstream to the TSS (Additional file 2 and Figure 1). In contrast, [G→T]/[C→A]
and [A→T]/[T→A] ratios are close to one in the 5' flanking regions of the genes in most mammalian species
(Additional file 1 and Additional file 2).
Strand asymmetries along fish genes are different from
mammalian asymmetries

Strand asymmetries are also found in introns of nonmammalian species (Figure 1), but their directions are
different in most cases. In stickleback and medaka
introns, the [A→G]/[T→C] ratio is smaller than one,
opposite to the asymmetry in mammals (Figure 1). And
the ratio [C→T]/[G→A] is greater than one, as it is found
in the first 1-2 kbp downstream the TSS of genes in mammals, but it is not restricted to the vicinity of the TSS in
fish genes. In contrast to mammals, in fish there is no difference in the level of asymmetry between CGI-and nonCGI-genes.
The current single nucleotide substitution rates lead to TA
and GC skews

Over a long period of time, biases in substitution rates
should accumulate and lead to skews in the base composition of complementary DNA strands [21]. Measurements along introns of the TA skew (=([T]-[A])/
([T]+[A])) and the GC skew (=([G]-[C])/([G]+[C])) [19]
have been shown to differ between species as well as in
respect to their location relative to the TSS [18,19,22]. It
is interesting to see whether the observed biases of
intronic substitution rates can lead to similar skews as
seen in current genomes. We have found that for all vertebrates this is indeed the case; the direction of stationary
skews in intronic regions agrees with the current ones in
CGI-genes (Additional file 3) and in nonCGI-genes
(Additional file 4). Hence, the substitution rates can
indeed build the current skews in the genome. For nonCGI-genes the degree of the stationary skews are similar
to the current ones in mammals. However, in intronic
regions of primate CGI-genes, the stationary TA and GC
skews are greater than the current ones. This might be
due to the simplicity of our genome evolution model,
which does not include other mutational processes, such
as insertion and deletions that might have been acting
against the influence of substitutions on base composition around and within genes. Alternatively, it is possible
that the mutational force that leads to skews has become
stronger during primate evolution.
Another characteristic of both the TA and GC skews is
spikes at boundaries of genes (Additional file 3 and Additional file 4). At the 5'end of genes there is a local increase
in both skews. For example in primates and rodents the

Page 4 of 12

GC skew is above 0.1 while in the rest of the transcript
the skew is below 0.06 (Additional file 3 and Additional
file 4). However at the 3'ends the GC skew is negative in
all species except for primates, where we do not see a GC
skew. So the GC skew is in opposite directions at both
ends of genes. TA skews are positive along genes and are
stronger near gene boundaries in all species, while strongest at the 3'ends. The increase in skews in gene boundaries, in particular at the 5'ends, is found also in the
stationary nucleotide composition in most of species
computed solely from the nucleotide substitution rates
(Additional file 3 and Additional file 4). This suggests that
substitutional biases acting over evolutionary time scales
have generated these spikes in the skews.
In the upstream regions of primate and laurasiatheria
CGI-genes one might expect to find skews since in these
regions there are strand asymmetries in substitution rates
(Figure 1 and Additional file 2). However, in both taxa the
TA and GC skews are close to zero in the 5' intergenic
flanking regions of CGI-genes. This might imply that
even though we observe that two out of six single-nucleotide substitution rates are strand asymmetric, it is not
enough to induce non-zero skews. Indeed, in laurasiatheria, the stationary skews are absent, which indicates that
other mutational processes compensate the impact of
strand specific nucleotide mutations. But the negative
stationary TA and GC skews in primates suggest that the
strand asymmetries in substitution rates are able to
induce strand asymmetries in nucleotide distribution in
these regions (Additional file 3).
Mutational pressure tends to increase the GC content in the
vicinity of TSSs of dog and stickleback genes

Besides strand asymmetries we also investigated the
impact of substitution rates on the GC content. All
genomes of animals that have been sequenced so far are
AT rich [23]. However, the GC content along the genome
is heterogeneous [24,25], and the GC content in animals
is higher near the TSS of genes than in other regions [26].
In particular, in mammals, the GC content near the TSS
is higher by about 50% than on a genome wide level [26].
Several studies on the evolution of the GC content near
the TSS debate whether selection has shaped the GC content or mutational mechanisms [13,19,26,27]. To address
this, we used the estimated substitution rates in order to
calculate the stationary GC content (GC*) along genes
(Figure 2 and Additional file 5).
All mammals examined, except for the dog, show a
clear peak in GC content at the TSS, while in the GC*
profile the peak is lower indicating the loss of CpG
islands. This trend is most pronounced in primate and rat
CGI-genes, where the GC* profile is almost flat along the
regions examined (Figure 2). This result is surprising,
since CpG islands are usually believed to play a regulatory

role in the transcription of genes [28] and therefore, one
expects the current GC peaks to be preserved also in GC*
profiles. Interestingly, given the close relation to human
and chimpanzee, the orangutan genome shows a high
rate of strong to weak substitutions leading to significantly lower GC content throughout the examined
regions. In cow and horse genomes, GC* near the TSS is
about 50%, which is higher than the value of 43% GC* in
distal regions (Figure 2). Also at mouse TSSs, the
expected GC* is, at 60%, well above 50% but still lower
than the current GC content. However, most surprisingly,
in dogs, the current GC content is about 60% at the TSS,
while GC* is about 70%. So dog is the only mammalian
specie where the recent nucleotide substitution rates lead
to an increase in GC content around the TSS.
In stickleback, the GC* is higher than the current GC
content along the regions we analyzed (Figure 2). The GC
content at the 5'ends of CGI-genes is slightly greater than
50%. However, GC* is above 60% and hence stickleback
promoters are expected to become richer in GCs than
current mammalian promoters. Also in the intergenic
regions, GC* is higher than in other species; it is around
50% at the upstream intergenic regions and about 48% in
the regions downstream to the TSS (Figure 2).
Methylation deamination rates drop near the TSS of
vertebrate CGI-genes

One of the major mutational processes that impact the
GC content along the genome is methylation of cytosines

that are part of CpGs, which is by far the strongest mutational process in the mammalian genomes [14]. The rates
of CpG to TpG or CpA substitutions are more than ten
times higher than any other single base substitutions in
the human lineage [29]. However, near the TSS of CGIgenes in vertebrates, we find that methylation-deamination rates drop close to zero (Additional file 6) as we have
seen before in human genes [17]. In nonCGI-genes we
also observe a decrease in the CpG methyaltion-deamination rates near the TSS but it is more moderate than in
CGI-genes (Additional file 7). This difference in methylation-deamination rates at the proximity of TSSs between
nonCGI-and CGI-genes is expected, since CGIs are subject to lower methylation levels compared to the rest of
the genome [30] and consequently, CpGs in CGIs are less
prone to deamination [20]. The impact of methylationdeamination can also increase the transversion rates in
CpGs. Indeed, we observe that transversion rates of Cytosine or Guanine in CpG decline near TSSs of CGI-genes,
but this decrease is more moderate than the one observed
for transitions (Additional file 8 and Additional file 9).
This implies that methylation related transversions and
transitions are not caused by the same process.
The ratio of [WTS]/[STW] increases near the TSSs of
vertebrate genes

GC* reflects the balance between the rates of WTS and
STW substitutions. Therefore, it is not surprising that the
ratio [W→S]/[S→W] increases near the TSS of verte-

brate genes. In particular this is true for CGI-genes in
mammals and stickleback. In most species the change of
cytosine into uracil occurs at higher rates than other single base mutations; therefore, at the genome wide level
the ratio [W→S]/[S→W] is lower than one in animal
genomes [3]. The rates of CpG methylation-deamination
are significantly lower near mammalian TSSs than in the
rest of the genome, which might induce the peak in the
[W→S]/[S→W] profile near TSSs. However, even after
excluding the CpG methylation-deamination rates in the
calculation of the ratio [W→S]/[S→W] (using only the
single-base substitution rates) we observe an increase of
this ratio near the TSS of mammalian CGI-genes (Additional file 10). This ratio is greater than one in the vicinity
of the TSS of laurasiatheria and mouse genes. In stickleback in particular, the ratio is greater than one along all
analyzed regions. These results imply that in vertebrate
non-CpG sites, the mutational pressure favors strong
bases near the TSS.

Discussion
Mechanisms that violate the balance between [ATG] and
[TTC] in transcribed regions

It has been proposed that the excess of [A→G] over
[T→C] substitutions in mammals is a byproduct of transcription coupled repair (TCR). TCR is activated when
RNA polymerase II stalls due to DNA lesions [5]. Green
et al. [2] suggested that lesions that halt RNA pol II can be
base mismatches that are formed during replication.
There are two replication errors contributing to substitutions of A in G on the non-transcribed strand. The first
error is misincorporation of Gs at template Ts when the
non-transcribed strand is copied. The second error is
misincorporation of Cs at template As during the replication of the transcribed strand. These errors result in G-T
and A-C (non transcribed-transcribed) mismatches,
which become the substitution-mutations A→G on the
non-transcribed strand, when they are repaired into G-C
base pairs. In a similar fashion, a substitution T in C on
the non-transcribed strand is a result of misincorporations of Cs at template As and of Gs at template Ts, which
results in C-A and T-G mismatches. When the base pair
mismatches are repaired via the TCR pathway, the nontranscribed strand serves as a template for the correction
of the transcribed strand. Therefore, the balance between
the rates of [A→G] and [T→C] is determined by the balance between misincorporations and their repair. Since
the miss-incorporation rate of purines into the strand
being copied is higher than the rate of pyrimidines, the
rate [A→G] is higher than of [T→C] on the non-transcribed strand.
The above model has been criticized by different
groups mainly because mismatches in the DNA are not
expected to halt transcription and therefore should not

Page 6 of 12

initiate TCR. An alternative model, that we suggest, is
that mismatches are introduced by a removal of DNA
lesions that block transcription via error-prone nucleotide-excision repair (NER) mechanisms. By this model,
the DNA lesion is excised together with a surrounding
DNA sequence and the resulting gap [31] is filled by a low
fidelity DNA polymerase, such as DNA polymerase beta
[32]. As a consequence the newly synthesized DNA is
prone to accumulate mutations and to form DNA mismatches. Unfortunately, the in-vivo error spectra of DNA
polymerases are not known and therefore without further
studies we can not suggest DNA polymerases that might
be the good candidates to explain the observed biases.
In a previous study we suggested that the mechanism,
which generates the localized strand asymmetry near the
TSS of human genes, is part of the somatic hyper mutation process (SHM see below); a processes that induces a
genetic diversification of antibodies. In a recent paper,
Steele reviewed the data on mutations, that result from
SHM, along introns of genes that are part of the Immunoglublin locus [33]. Steele found that in this locus, on the
non-transcribed strand, the mutation rates of A→G,
A→T and A→C excess their reverse complement mutation rates. We also observe an excess of [A→G] over
[TTC] and an excess of [A→T] over [T→A] along mammalian introns (Figure 1 and Additional file 2). But on the
other hand, we find no or only a slight excess of [A→C]
over [T→G] (Additional file 1). These similarities imply
that somatic hyper mutation and TCR employ similar but
not identical sets of proteins.
How are strand biases introduced in SHM? During
somatic hyper mutation, the induction of the enzyme
"Activation Induced Cytidine Deaminase" (AID) leads to
the deamination of cytosines into uracils on the nontranscribed strand of immunoglobulin genes [34]. The
U:G mismatches are assumed to invoke mutations in two
phases [35]. At the first phase, the handling with U:G
mismatches leads to transitions or transversions of C:G
base pairs. If one strand is primarily targeted by AID,
then the rates of C→T, C→G and C→A will exceed the
rates of the reverse complement strand. At the second
phase, mutations can occur in the surrounding sequence
of the U:G mismatch mainly in A:T base pairs [33]. This
has been suggested to be due to the removal of parts of
the surrounding sequence containing an abasic site that is
created when the uracil is excised by uracil-DNA glyocsylase (UNG). The resulting gap is then filled by the error
prone DNA polymerase eta [36,37], promoting mutations
of the type A→T. As a consequence, the non-transcribed
strand of immunoglobulin genes accumulates transversions in ATT over T→A, as we also find in mammalian
introns (Additional file 2).
Even though the before mentioned pathways can
explain part of the global asymmetries along introns,

Polak et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:187
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/187

there are two arguments against these hypotheses. First,
in SHM the non-transcribed strand is often damaged and
is also actively repaired [34], while in TCR, the transcribed strand is subject to repair processes [5]. Second,
the bias of [A→G] over [T→C] can not be explained by
the traditional models for SHM.
An intriguing model, which has been recently suggested for SHM, provides a mechanism that can explain
the observed global asymmetries, including the excess of
[A→G] over [T→C] on the non-transcribed strand, via a
repair of the transcribed strand. Higher mutation rates in
As on the non-transcribed strand of immunoglobulin
genes have been postulated to be caused by repair of the
transcribed strand, via a combination of reverse transcription and RNA editing [38]. By this model, a DNA
strand that contains abasic sites and/or uracil is first transcribed into RNA. This RNA forms a secondary structure
with hairpins. Adenosines in the RNA hairpins are
known targets for the RNA editing enzyme adenosine
deaminase (ADAR) and are converted to inosines [38]. In
the next step, reverse transcription of such an edited
RNA results in a DNA sequence that is inserted into the
DNA strand instead of the damaged fragment. Compared
to the original transcribed sequence the newly synthesized transcribed-strand accumulates several mutations
T→C, T→A and T→G [38] that appear on the non-transcribed strand as A→G, A→T and A→C. By our results
for introns, the substitution frequencies of A→G and
A→T exceed their reverse complement substitution frequencies (Figure 1 and Additional file 2), while [A→C] is
only slightly exceeding [T→G] (Additional file 1). This
suggests that such a repair mechanism can introduce the
global strand asymmetries along genes.
Mechanisms that violate the balance between [ATG] and
[TTC] in intergenic regions

The excess of [A→G] over [T→C] substitutions downstream to the 3'end might be a result of the non-template
strand being signaled for TCR or due to the continuation
of transcription downstream to the 3'end [39] or because
of other processes that are not induced by transcription
per se [40]. The opposite bias [A→G]/[T→C] < 1, which
is found upstream to genes, might be indicative for antisense transcription [39] from CGIs [17]. An alternative
explanation is that CGIs in mammals are origins of bidirectional replication and here the asymmetries are caused
by different handling of the leading and lagging strand
during replication [41]. Also we propose that in laurasiatherian nonCGI-genes, the fact that in the upstream
regions [A→G]/[T→C] > 1 (Figure 1) might be due to
poor annotation of genes in dog (where most of genes are
projected from other species). Therefore, the TSS might
be located further upstream in nonCGI-genes than predicted by computational algorithms.

Mechanisms that break the [C→T] and [G→A] symmetry
within genes

Again TCR can be causative for this asymmetry and as we
previously pointed out; the localized asymmetry
observed in mammals [17], could be caused by frequent
single strand conformation of the non-template strand in
the vicinity of the TSS. Since cytosine in ssDNA deaminates at higher rates than in double stranded DNA
(dsDNA) [42], this can lead to the formation of the asymmetry in GC rich regions, in particular in CGIs, as we
observe. Prolonged ssDNA conformation around the TSS
can be caused by a high occupancy time of RNA pol-II or
the formation of secondary structures like R-loops and Gloops, which are preferentially formed in GC-rich regions
[39]. In fish, the excess of [C→T]/[G→A] over one is not
restricted to the first 2 kb as it persists along the whole
transcript (Figure 1). Such an excess is found also in bacterial transcribed regions due to ssDNA conformation
during transcription [9]. Hence, we suggest that the nontemplate strand of fish genes, which are shorter than
mammalian genes, is found at ssDNA conformation at
higher frequencies than in mammals. We predict that
mammals might have developed mechanisms that prevent ssDNA formation outside of the first 2 kbp of transcripts. Lastly, the lower ratios of both [C→T]/[G→A]
and [A→G]/[T→C] within intronic regions of nonCGIgenes can reflect a lower expression level of these genes
during early development and in germ line cells [20,30],
which would lead to a lower activity of transcription and
TCR.
Mechanisms that increase the rates of WTS over STW

A molecular process that has been suggested to increase
the rates of W→S over S→W substitution is the GCbiased gene conversion (BGC), which arises as a consequence of the GC-biased repair of G/C:A/T mismatches,
that are formed in heteroduplex intermediates during
recombination events in meiosis [13]. The BGC process,
is not a mutagenic process that introduces de-novo mutations in the genome, but instead it increases the fixation
probability of GC alleles over AT alleles [43,44]. Therefore BGC is assumed to act as a positive selective force for
GC alleles with a selective coefficient that correlates with
the recombination rates. In contrast, for S→W mutations, BGC acts as purifying selection force. Hence, BGC
would increase the rate of W→S substitutions while
decreasing the rate of S→W substitutions. This pattern is
similar to the one that we observe near TSSs of CGIgenes in dog, cow, horse, stickleback and medaka (Figure
2). In rodents, the picture is slightly different. In contrast
to other mammals, at the 2 kb regions centered at the
TSS, the substitution frequencies are lower than in
regions that are found at a distance of 1-5 kbp from the
5'ends. However, the drop in rates implies that negative

Polak et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:187
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/187

selection near TSSs is stronger for mouse genes than in
the rest of mammalian species. Within the 2 kbp long
regions centered in mouse CGI-gene TSSs, there is an
increase (and a decrease) in [W→S] ([S→W]) (Figure 2).
In sum, the signature of BGC mutations rates is found
near the TSS in all mammals and fish. However, these
substitution patterns can also be formed due to a positive
selection on the local GC content near the TSS. A pair of
substitutions, which does not impact the GC content but
has been found to be positively correlated with recombination rates is G:CTC:G [12]. In dog genes, these rates
also increase in the vicinity of the 5'end of genes, in particular in CGI-genes. Therefore, we suggest that the BGC
rates have shaped the patterns of [W→S]/[S→W] ratios
in the vicinity of the TSS in all species.
Chromosome length correlates with [WTS]/[STW]

Previous studies have revealed that [W→S]/[S→W] is
significantly higher in dogs than in any other mammal. It
has been speculated that this is due to the shorter length
of dog chromosomes, which is suggestive for higher
recombination rates along these chromosome [3]. A support for this theory is that chicken micro-chromosomes,
compared to macro-chromosomes, have a higher GC
content, a higher observed/expected ratio of CpG, and a
higher density of CpG islands [45]. This observation was
recently extended to vertebrate genomes, in which the
above three genomic features are anticorrelated with the
chromosomal length [46]. Therefore, two species that
have a similar population size but different average chromosomal length would have different [W→S]/[S→W]
ratios. Dog, which has the shortest chromosomes among
the mammals studied here, is expected to have the highest recombination rates.
In a similar fashion, one can explain the difference
between stickleback and medaka. The average medaka
chromosome is about 29 Mb long, 1.3 times longer than
that of stickleback (22 Mb). If recombination rates are
roughly reversely proportional to the chromosome length
in stickleback, then the recombination rates should be
about 1.3 times higher than in medaka. The value of
[W→S]/[S→W] in non-CpG sites in stickleback is about
1.3 compared to the ratio of 0.85 in medaka, that is, 50%
greater. This difference can also explain the higher density of CGIs in the stickleback (150 CGI/Mb) genome
compared to the medaka genome (37 CGI/Mb) [46].
Recombination rates are higher near the TSS due to
adaptation

Compared to cow and horse, in dog genes the ratio of
[W→S] over [S→W] is only higher near the TSS. Higher
recombination rates along dog chromosomes can not
solely explain the peak in [W→S]/[S→W] near the TSS.
Interestingly, dog and stickleback, which have the highest

Page 8 of 12

[W→S]/[S→W] ratios, are the species that have experienced the greatest number of adaptation events or bottlenecks among the studied species [47,48]. The evolution of
regulatory elements is often considered to be the prime
driver of adaptation. Hence, it is possible that recombination rates are higher at the TSS in both dog and stickleback genes, due to the selection of newly recombinant
promoter regions. The recombination rates along the
genome are heterogeneous and determined by unknown
factors; the rates themselves have been constantly changing during evolution. The recombination maps in human
and chimpanzee reveal low number of overlapping
hotspots [49,50]; the reason for that is not clear, but it is
possible that selection can shape these rates across the
genome during evolution. For example, in species like
stickleback, which constantly adapt to new environments,
recombination rates are expected to be higher near the
TSS, since crossing over events can increase the fitness of
the specie in a new environment. Another scenario is that
recombination rates do not differ significantly between
species, but the fixation rate of W→S substitutions
increases near the TSS due to positive selection on GC
rich motifs [26]. However, the fixation dynamic of these
GC-alleles is similar to the one that is caused by BGC [44]
and therefore these scenarios are indistinguishable by
sequence comparison [43].
Insights on evolution of transcription patterns

So far we have tried to explain the substitution patterns
using biases in molecular processes, but there is the possibility that substitution profiles have been shaped by
selection. For example, the strand asymmetries can be
due to DNA motifs like transcription factor binding sites
or splicing enhancers. Such motifs can be strand specific
and their distribution can generate the observed strand
biases [51]. In the near future, the increasing amount of
experimentally verified regulatory elements will allow
quantifying the contribution of selection to the strand
asymmetries in substitution rates.
Insights on the evolution of transcriptional processes
across vertebrates

The substitution patterns in genes and their flanks are an
evolutionary foot print of transcriptional processes. The
fact that substitution asymmetries in CGI-genes are
stronger than in nonCGI-genes could be indicative for
CGI-genes being transcribed more often across mammalian germline cells. In addition, the inverse direction of
the asymmetries [A→G] and [T→C] in upstream-intergenic regions compared to downstream-intronic regions
of CGI-genes suggests that CGI-genes are origins of bidirectional transcription in mammals. On the other hand,
the excess of [C→T] over [G→A] in intronic regions of
CGI-genes, but not in the upstream regions, implies that

Polak et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:187
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/187

there is a preference for one direction over the other. This
suggests that substitution patterns can be used as a telescope to watch on the past of transcriptional processes.

Conclusions
In this study we have found that within intronic regions,
strand asymmetries between complementary substitution rates are found in all mammals. The profiles of the
strand asymmetries are similar among mammals. We
have found that strand asymmetries might be distinct in
two different classes of genes. The excess of [C→T] over
[G→A] is found in the 2 kb long regions downstream to
the TSS of CGI-genes but not in non-CGI genes. Other
strand asymmetries were found in both classes of genes
but the degree of the asymmetries was reduced in nonCGI genes. This might imply that TCR is more active in
CGI-genes, maybe due to their higher expression in germ
cells.
In fish genomes we find other patterns of asymmetries
than in mammals. The excess of [A→G] over [T→C] that
is found along mammalian genes is not present in fish
genes, where we observe an opposite bias. Another difference is the fact the localized asymmetries are absent in
fishes. We hypothesize that this difference is related to
differences in TCR and mutagenic processes between fish
and mammals.
Another topic that has been addressed in this work is
the bias between [W→S] and [S→W]. The ratio [W→S]/
[S→W] peaks at the TSS in most genomes. We suggest
that this profile has been generated by BGC. The substitution rates also lead to a peak in the GC* profile near the
TSS, but it can not explain the high current GC content
near the TSS, since in most species GC* is lower than the
current GC content. Moreover, in the majority of species,
GC* is only slightly higher at the TSS than in further distal regions. The two exceptions are dog and stickleback,
where GC* at the TSS is higher than the current GC content. We hypothesize that in these two species recombination in the promoters occurs or has occurred at higher
rates than in other species and similarly biased gene conversion. Causative for high recombination rates might be
the fact that both species have undergone strong selection through adaptation or breeding.
Methods
Substitution analysis

We estimated the substitution frequencies for all genes
with respect to the non-template strand (i.e. the not transcribed or coding strand). We estimated the profiles of
twelve single nucleotide substitution frequencies [XTY].
In addition, due to the impact of methylation on mutation frequencies in vertebrate cells, six context dependent
substitution processes of CpGs into TpG, CpA, ApG,
CpT, CpC and GpG, have been taken into account and

Page 9 of 12

their frequencies quantified. Substitution frequencies
have been estimated from multiple alignments of
genomic sequences (see below). We used a maximum
likelihood approach which correctly handles effects due
to back-mutations [12] and is able to reliably estimate
substitution frequencies from given aligned sequences
along all branches that are not directly connected to the
root node (the node that represents the last common
ancestor of all species in a given tree) [17]. In order to
estimate frequencies we assume that sequence evolution
is a time irreversible Markovian process. In contrast to
many models, we assume that the molecular clock might
differ between different branches. Therefore, we estimate
the 18 substitution frequencies along each branch of the
phylogeny. Another difference between our model and
other commonly used sequence evolution models is that
we do not assume that the DNA nucleotide composition
is at equilibrium. These relaxations make our model very
general in comparison with other models.
We measure substitution frequencies per base pair,
estimating the (fractional) number of nucleotide
exchanges from one nucleotide to another along each
branch of the phylogeny. We may compute the corresponding substitution rates (measured per bp and time)
by dividing frequencies in the time that passed along a
branch. However, in this study we are interested in the
spectra of substitutions i.e. the relative difference
between two substitution processes and therefore work
with the frequencies only.
Sequence annotation and multiple alignments

We analyzed the substitution frequencies of ten species:
Human (Homo sapiens), Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes),
Orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), Mouse (Mus musculus),
Rat (Rattus norvegicus), Dog (Canis familiaris), Cow (Bos
Taurus), Horse (Equus caballus), Stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and Medaka (Oryzias latipes). For the
purpose of our analysis; mammals were grouped into the
three clades of primates, rodents and laurasitheria
(including dog, cow and horse). For mammals, gene
annotation and multiple species alignments were downloaded from ensemble v55 [52]. For primates we used 4way catarrhini-specific EPO alignments [53], for rodents
and laurasiatheria the twelve amniota vertebrates EPO
alignments [53]. The Enredo and Pecan (which together
with Ortheus) comprise the EPO pipe line assures the
consistency of the alignments with paralogs [53]. For fish
gene annotation and Multiz 3-way alignments were
downloaded from UCSC [54]. In each clade analyzed,
gene annotation of just one species was used to determine the regions of interest. That is in primates: human
(Ensembl v55), rodents: mouse (Ensembl v55), laurasitheria: dog (Ensembl v55) and in fish: stickleback (Ensembl
v55). CGI coordinates for human, mouse, dog and stickle-

back were taken from the Ensembl (v55), and CpG island
defined by: minimum length 400 bps; minimum GC content is 50%; and minimum ratio of observed CpG over
expected is 0.6. In our analysis we used only protein coding genes and divided them into two classes: (1) CGIgenes, where the 5'end is found within a CpG island; (2)
And nonCGI-genes, where 5'end is not located in a CpG
island (see Additional file 11). The number and proportion of CGI-genes and nonCGI-genes vary among the references species. In human we used 9021 CGI-genes and
4786 nonCGI-genes and in mouse 6448 and 6708, respectively. Among the dog genes 2882 were CGI-related and
9262 nonCGI-related. The frequencies were then estimated from multiple alignments and the following phylogenies. Primates (((human, chimpanzee), orangutan),
rhesus), rodents: ((mouse, rat), human), laurasiatheria
(((dog, horse), cow), human) and ((stickleback, medaka),
tetraodon).
Dataset construction

The main goal of our analysis is to investigate the dependence of nucleotide substitution frequencies in transcribed regions and their 3' and 5' flanks. To do so, we
estimate 18 substitution frequencies within 10 kb regions
equally surrounding the transcript starts and similarly
around the ends of transcripts (see [17]). We estimate the
frequencies in the four taxa (primates, rodents, laurasiatheria and fish) independently by using a sliding window
analysis at a resolution of 200 bp. An estimation of 18
substitution frequencies for DNA sequences of a few
hundred bp in length will be dominated by stochastic
noise. Therefore, in order to estimate the frequencies at
specific positions relative to the gene ends, we used
genome-wide pooled 200 bp long non-overlapping windows, which are located at fixed distances from individual 5'ends (or 3'ends) while masking all annotated exons
(Additional file 11). For each gene we defined intronic
and intergenic flanking regions around its 5' and 3'ends
(Additional file 11). The ends of genes are given by
Ensembl annotations and they are defined as the furthest
5' and 3'ends among all transcripts of one gene (alternative TSSs were ignored). The boundaries of the analyzed
regions were the middle points between the gene and its
neighbor genes. Since we restrict the analyzed regions to
a distance of 5 kbp from either 5' or 3'ends of genes, the
maximal distance of a window from one of the genes ends
is 5 kbp (Additional file 11). But since we include genes
shorter than 5 kbp, in these cases the analyzed regions
will be truncated and, hence, shorter than 5 kbp (Additional file 11). For example, genes of length 3 kbps will not
intersect with windows that are found at a distance of 3 to
5 kbp downstream to the TSS. Hence, this gene will not
contribute to the pool of intronic sequences at these dis-

Page 10 of 12

tances. The same is true for genes with either upstream to
the 5'ends (or downstream to 3'ends) intergenic regions
shorter than 10 kbp (Additional file 11). Similarly,
intronic windows that overlap (partly or completely) with
exons residing on the opposite strand are truncated to
exclude all exonic regions (Additional file 11). The substitution frequencies have been estimated from pooled
alignments of genomic sequences of up to 4 representative species in each taxon (see above).
Estimation of [WTS] and [STW] frequencies

The frequencies of substitutions of weak base (W = A or
T) to strong base (S = C or G) and vice versa are calculated as follows:
[W → S] = ([A]([A → G] + [A → C]) + [ T]([ T → G] + [ T → C])) / ([A] + [ T])
[S → W] = ([C]([C → A] + [C → T]) + [G]([G → A] + [G → T]) + [CpG]([CpG → CpT] +
[CpG → CpA] + [CpG → ApG] + [CpG → TpG])) / ([C] + [G])

Where [X→Y] is the frequency of substitutions of base
× in Y. The density of base × in a bin is denoted by [X];
[CpG] is the density of the CpG di-nucleotides.
