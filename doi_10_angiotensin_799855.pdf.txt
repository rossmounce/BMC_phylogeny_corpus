Abstract
Background: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive human malignancies, with a very poor prognosis. To
evaluate the effect of angiotensin II (Ang II) type 2 receptor (AT2) expression in the host’s body on the growth of
pancreatic carcinoma, we have investigated the growth of mouse pancreatic ductal carcinoma grafts in syngeneic
wild type and AT2 receptor-deficient (AT2-KO) mice.
Methods: The role of AT2 receptor-signaling in stromal cells on the growth of murine pancreatic carcinoma cells
(PAN02) was studied using various in vitro and in vivo assays. In vivo cell proliferation, apoptosis, and vasculature in
tumors were monitored by Ki-67 immunostaining, TUNEL assay, and von Willebrand factor immunostaining,
respectively. In the co-culture study, cell proliferation was measured by MTT cell viability assay. All the data were
analyzed using t-test and data were treated as significant when p < 0.05.
Results: Our results show that the growth of subcutaneously transplanted syngeneic xenografts of PAN02 cells,
mouse pancreatic ductal carcinoma cells derived from the C57/BL6 strain, was significantly faster in AT2-KO mice
compared to control wild type mice. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissue revealed significantly more Ki67 positive cells in xenografts grown in AT2-KO mice than in wild type mice. The index of apoptosis is slightly
higher in wild type mice than in AT2-KO mice as evaluated by TUNEL assay. Tumor vasculature number was
significantly higher in AT2-KO mice than in wild type mice. In vitro co-culture studies revealed that the growth of
PAN02 cells was significantly decreased when grown with AT2 receptor gene transfected wild type and AT2-KO
mouse-derived fibroblasts. Faster tumor growth in AT2-KO mice may be associated with higher VEGF production in
stromal cells.
Conclusions: These results suggest that Ang II regulates the growth of pancreatic carcinoma cells through
modulating functions of host stromal cells; Moreover, Ang II AT2 receptor signaling is a negative regulator in the
growth of pancreatic carcinoma cells. These findings indicate that the AT2 receptor in stromal fibroblasts is a
potentially important target for chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer.

Background
Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in many countries, including the United
States. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) constitutes approximately 90% of all primary malignant
tumors arising from the pancreatic gland. Of all

gastrointestinal malignancies, pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the second most common cause of death from
cancer [1-3]. Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignant cancer with a high metastatic rate and is an
almost uniformly lethal disease in humans [3-5]. Of
affected patients, 60% have liver metastasis, malignant
ascites, or other evidence of tumor spread at the time
of diagnosis [6]. The 5-year survival rate in the United
States is less than 5% [3].

The renin-angiotensin system is one of the phylogenetic hormone systems and plays a key role in the regulation of cardiovascular homeostasis, which maintains
arterial blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis [7,8]. Angiotensin II (Ang II), an octapeptide hormone, is the key effector in the renin-angiotensin system.
Ang II has two well-defined receptors: Ang II type 1
(AT1) and type 2 (AT2) receptor [9]. The AT1 receptor is
widely expressed in a variety of adult tissues. AT1 receptor-mediated signaling is responsible for most Ang IIdependent actions in cardiovascular and renal tissues.
Responses of the AT1 receptor are typically associated
with stimulation of growth factor receptors leading to
cell growth, proliferation, cell migration, apoptosis, and
gene expression [10,11]. These effects are executed
through a heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptor,
which mediates Ang II transactivated epidermal growth
factor (EGF)-induced activation of MEK (MAPK kinase
1) and ERK [12]. The AT2 receptor, the second major
isoform of the Ang II receptor, is primarily expressed in
the mesenchyme of the fetus and to a limited extent in
adult tissues [13]. It is, however, inducible and functional
under pathophysiologic conditions [14-17]. The AT 2
receptor mediates signals that counteract the AT1 receptor-mediated biological actions [18-20]. In addition, the
AT2 receptor is known to inhibit cell proliferation and
stimulate apoptosis in cardiovascular and neuronal tissues in vitro [21]. However, the relationship between the
AT2 receptor and cancer has yet to be clarified. Our previous studies revealed that chemical carcinogen-induced
tumorigenesis in mouse colon [22] and lung [15] was significantly attenuated by AT2 receptor deficiency. Since
AT2 receptor expression has been noted in various stromal fibroblasts [23,24] and is inducible in the pancreas in
pathological conditions [25], AT 2 receptor deficiency
may also influence pancreatic cancer growth. In addition,
Ang II receptor antagonists and angiotensin I-converting
enzyme inhibitors currently used for human clinical
hypertension treatment attenuate growth of human cancer cells in experimental animals [26-30] and may reduce
the risk of several human cancers[31]. This suggests that
AT2 receptor expression potentially plays an important
role in cancer.
In the present study, we subcutaneously inoculated
pancreatic ductal carcinoma cells in syngeneic AT2-KO
and wild type mice and examined tumor growth, cell
proliferation, and apoptosis. In addition to the in vivo
study, we also studied the effect of stromal fibroblasts,
which were prepared from either AT2 -KO or control
wild type mice, on PAN02 cancer cell growth in vitro.
These studies revealed that Ang II AT2 receptor signaling in stromal cells plays an important regulatory role in
the growth of pancreatic carcinoma cells.

(San Carlos, CA). The AT 1 receptor blocker Losartan
was a gift from Dr. Tadashi Inagami (Vanderbilt University Medical Center); the AT 2 receptor blocker
PD123319 was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St.
Louis, MO). Rabbit anti-human von Willebrand factor
(vWF) and rat anti-mouse Ki-67 antibodies were purchased from DakoCytomation (Glostrup, Denmark).
Rabbit anti-human vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) and rabbit anti-human GAPDH antibodies
were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz,
CA). A biotin-conjugated secondary antibody was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove,
PA). Avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (ABC) reagents
was from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). ApopTag® Plus Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit
was from Chemicon International, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan).
Bio-aRat biotin-conjugated secondary antibody was

A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG
secondary antibody was from Amersham Biosciences
(Piscataway, NJ). All other chemicals were of analytical
grade.
Cell culture

The PAN02 murine pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line
was obtained from the National Cancer Institute and
maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100
U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.
Primary cultured mouse skin fibroblasts (MSFs) from
wild type and AT2-KO mice were prepared from 24 to
48 hour old C57BL/6J mouse pups following an established method [14]. MSFs were cultured in DMEM/
Ham’s F-12 medium (1:1) supplemented with 10% FBS,
100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All
cells were incubated in 5% CO2 humidified air at 37°C.
Animals and genotyping

Hemizygous AT2-KO mutant (Agtr2-/y) mice were generated as described previously [15]. These mice were backcrossed with wild type C57BL/6J (The Jackson Laboratory,
Bar Harbor, MA) for 17 generations such that the genetic
background of the mice is susceptible to our pancreatic
cancer syngeneic model. Wild type littermates served as
controls. Genotypes were confirmed by the PCR method
using extracted tail DNA. Briefly, published sequences
[19,32] were used to synthesize primers for the AT 2
receptor (forward 5’-CACCAGCAGAAACATTAC-3’
and reverse 5’-AACACAGCTGTTGAATCC-3’) and the
neomycin resistance (Neo-r) gene product (forward

5’-AGCCAACGCTATGTCCTGAT-3’ and reverse
5’-AGACAATCGGCTGCTCTGAT-3’). Extracted tail
DNA (10-20 ng) was amplified (35 cycles) at 95°C for 1
minute (denaturation), at 58°C for 1 minute (annealing),
and at 72°C for 1 minute (elongation) with 0.5 nmol/L of
each primer, 1.25 units DNA polymerase, and 0.2 mmol/L
deoxynucleotide triphosphates in PCR buffer. PCR products of the AT2 receptor (478 bp) and Neo-r gene product (593 bp) were visualized by 1% agarose gel
electrophoresis. AT2 (+) and Neo-r (-), AT2 (+) and Neo-r
(+), and AT2 (-) and Neo-r (+) were assigned as wild type,
heterozygote, and AT2-KO, respectively. All animals were
maintained in a humidity- and temperature-controlled
room on 12-hour light/dark cycles. All procedures for
handling animals were approved by the Institutional Committee for Animal Care and Use of Kansas State
University.
Pancreatic cancer syngeneic model

Seven to nine week-old AT 2 -KO/C57BL/6J mice and
wild-type littermates were anesthetized with isoflurane.
Cells were trypsinized and washed with PBS. Five million cells in 200 μl PBS were subcutaneously inoculated
into each flank using a 1 ml syringe with a 27G needle
[16]. The tumor size was measured by caliper every
three days and the volume was calculated using the formula (short diameter)2 × (long diameter) × 0.5 [17].
At the end of the experiments, the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation under anesthesia. The
tumors were dissected and weighed. For histological
assessment, the specimens were fixed in 10% formalin,
embedded in paraffin, and sectioned for histopathological analysis.
Immunohistochemical analysis

Tissue sections of 4 μm thickness were prepared for all
staining. Slides were dewaxed and rehydrated before
staining. The heat-induced antigen unmasking was performed in Citra Plus Solution, pH 6.0 (BioGenex, San
Ramon, CA) for 5-10 minutes using an autoclave oven.
Sections were then incubated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 20 minutes to block endogenous
peroxide activity. The dilution of antibodies for Ki-67,
von Willebrand factor (vWF) and VEGF was 1:50, 1:100,
and 1:50, respectively. Sections were incubated with the
primary antibodies for 60 minutes at room temperature.
In immunostaining for Ki-67, sections were incubated
with biotin-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson
ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) followed by reaction
with the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (ABC)
reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30
minutes at room temperature. In immunostaining for
vWF, an ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) was used. Peroxidase activity was visualized with 3,3’-diaminobenzodine

tetrahydrochloride (Sigma Chemical Co). Sections were
lightly counterstained with Hematoxylin solution
(Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany).
TUNEL assay

To determine cell death, apoptotic cells in paraffin sections were detected by TUNEL (Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-Mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling)
assay using the Apop Taq Plus Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Millipore Corporation, Billerica,
MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sections were counterstained with Methyl green solution
(Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan).
Image analysis

Ki-67 or TUNEL positive cell numbers and whole cell
numbers (as background) in five randomly selected
fields were counted by two independent observers. The
VEGF positive cell area in five randomly selected fields
was evaluated using NIH digital-image analyzing software, Image J 1.37v, (NIH, Bethesda, MD).
Evaluation of the effect of angiotensin II and fibroblasts
on the growth of PAN02 cells

Primary cultured MSFs (100 cells/well, 96-well plate)
from wild type or AT 2 -KO mice were incubated in
serum-free medium in 5% CO2 humidified air at 37°C.
Following 24 hours incubation, PAN02 cells (400 cells/
well) were added to the culture plate and co-cultured
with the wild-type or AT2-KO MSFs in DMEM/Ham’s
F12 medium (1:1) containing 10% FBS. One day after
co-culture, the cells were treated with Ang II (10 nM)
for 48 hours in the presence of the AT2 receptor-specific antagonist PD123319 (10 μM). The degree of cell
proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay. In brief, 10
μl MTT solution (5 mg/ml) was added to each well 4
hours prior the end of the incubation. Formazan crystals
formed in the cells were dissolved by adding 100 μl of
MTT solvent (0.01 N HCl in 10% SDS). The absorbance
was measured at 550 nm by spectrometer 24 hours after
incubation at 37°C with the MTT solvent.
Evaluation of the effect of AT2 receptor over-expression
in fibroblasts on co-cultured PAN02 cell growth

MSFs from wild type or AT2-KO mice were seeded in
T25 flasks. After cell attachment, the medium was changed to serum-free DMEM. After three hours in the
serum-free medium, the medium was changed to 875 μl
DMEM containing 5% FBS and either adenoviral AT2
receptor (Ad-AT 2, 25 MOI) or adenoviral Lac Z (AdLac Z, 25 MOI). The cells were incubated in 5% CO2 at
37°C; the flasks were rocked every 15 minutes for 3
hours. After incubation with the vectors, DMEM/Ham’s
F12 (1:1) containing 10% FBS was added and the cells

Doi et al. BMC Cancer 2010, 10:67
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/10/67

were further incubated for an additional 24 hours at
37°C in 5% CO 2 . Both untransfected and transfected
MSFs were co-cultured with PAN02 cells (400 cells/
well) as described above. The extent of cell proliferation
was evaluated by MTT assay.
Gene expression analysis using real-time PCR

Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen). Genomic and complementary DNA
was removed using RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega,
Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time PCR was carried out using an iScript
One-Step RT-PCR Kit with SYBR Green (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and the reactions were conducted on the
real-time PCR detection system iCycler (Bio-Rad). The
results were quantified as Ct values, where Ct is defined
as the threshold cycle of PCR at which the amplified
product is first detected and signifies relative gene
expression (the ratio of target/control). The AT2 primers
were 5’-AGC CAA GGC CAG ATT GAA GA-3’ (forward) and 5’-GCC ACC AGC AGA AAC ATT ACC-3’
(reverse), the AT1 primers were 5’-GGC AGC ATC
GGA CTA AAT GG-3’ (forward) and 5’-CCA GCT
CCT GAC TTG TCC TTG-3’ (reverse), and the 18S
ribosome RNA primers were 5’-TCG CTC CAC CAA
CTA AGA AC-3’ (forward) and 5’-GAG GTT CGA
AGA CGA TCA GA-3’ (reverse).
Western blot analysis

Total cellular protein was prepared according to our
routinely used protocol [33]. The membrane was incubated with the antibody against VEGF at a 1:250 dilution in TBST with 0.1% nonfat dry milk for 1 hr at
room temperature. Then, the membrane was incubated
with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit
IgG secondary antibody at a 1:2000 dilution in TBST
with 0.1% nonfat dry milk for 1 hr at room temperature.
The protein expression signal was detected with Pierce
SuperSignal Western Blotting substrate. GAPDH was
used as the loading control of sample by reprobing with
an anti-GAPDH antibody at a 1:12000 dilution.

flanks of syngeneic AT 2 -KO (n = 6) and wild-type
(n = 6) C57BL/6 mice. Our results showed that tumor
growth was significantly faster in AT2-KO mice than in
the control wild type mice (Figure 1). At the time of
sacrifice, AT2-KO mice had significantly larger tumors
than wild type mice (Figure 1), with a mean
tumor volume of 642.73 and 263.37 mm3, respectively
(P < 0.05). Since real time PCR revealed that primary
cultured wild type mouse skin fibroblasts express the
AT2 receptor, but PAN02 cells do not (Table 1), these
results indicate that the host stromal AT 2 receptor is
involved in the growth of PAN02 xenografts.
The cell proliferation index was significantly higher in
AT2-KO mouse tumors than in wild type mouse tumors

To evaluate cell proliferation in tumors in both types of
mice, the cell growth index was analyzed using an antiKi-67 antibody. More Ki-67 positive cells were detected
in AT 2 -KO mouse tumor sections than in wild type
mouse tumor sections (Figure 2). A detailed examination of the morphology of the Ki-67 positive cells
revealed that these cells are tumor cells. In quantitative
analysis, the percentage of Ki-67 positive cells is significantly higher in AT 2 -KO mouse tumors than in wild
type mouse tumors (P ≤ 0.001, Figure 2C). This result
indicates that PAN02 tumor growth is faster in AT2-KO
mice than in wild type mice.
The apoptotic index was lower in AT2-KO mouse tumors
than in wild type mouse tumors

The in vivo apoptotic index in tumor tissue from
AT2-KO and wild type mice was examined by a Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-Mediated dUTP Nick
End Labeling (TUNEL) assay. As shown in Figure 3,
although slightly more TUNEL positive cells were
detected in tumors from wild type mice than in tumors
from AT 2 -KO mice, the difference between the two
values was statistically not significant (P = 0.21). In
addition, apoptotic cells appeared to be a mixture of
tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating leukocytes. This result
suggests that apoptosis may not be a major contributor
to the different tumor growth in the two groups.

Statistical analysis

Results are expressed as mean ± standard error of the
mean (SEM). For statistical analysis, a Microsoft Excel
Data Analysis tool, t-test, was used. The critical value
was 95%, and significance was defined as p < 0.05.

Results
Growth of mouse pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
grafts was faster in syngeneic AT2-KO mice than in wild
type mice

To investigate the influence of the AT 2 receptor on
tumor growth, we inoculated PAN02 cells into both

Histochemical analysis indicated higher vascular density
in AT2-KO mouse tumors than in wild type mouse tumors

Overall histochemical analysis of the tumors indicates
that they are undifferentiated carcinoma. Occasionally,
sarcoma-like morphology was observed in the tumor tissue (Figures 4A and 4B). Tumors in both mouse types
contain very little stroma. However, vascular endothelial
cell staining by anti-von Willebrand factor antibodies
revealed that tumors in the AT 2 -KO mice contain
significantly more microvasculatures than tumors in
wild type mice (Figure 4C and 4D). Average tumor

Figure 1 The effect of AT 2 receptor deficiency on the growth of murine pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PAN02) xenografts was
evaluated in syngeneic mouse model. PAN02 cells (5 × 106 cells suspension in 200 μl PBS) were inoculated into both flanks in either AT2-KO
(n = 6) or wild type mice (n = 6). Tumor volume was calculated after measuring tumor diameter every three to four days using a caliper (A).
Tumors were carefully removed at the end of the study and the tumor weight was determined (B). Data are presented as means ± SEM of
twelve tumors from six mice. * P ≤ 0.05 as compared to the level of wild type mouse group.

vasculature numbers in five randomly chosen fields in
wild type and AT2-KO mouse tumors was 2.1 ± 0.5 and
8.3 ± 0.1/field, respectively (p < 0.05). Furthermore,
immunostaining against VEGF revealed that the cells
with morphology similar to fibroblasts in tumor stroma
were the primary VEGF positive cells in the tumors.
Although VEGF expression in tumor cells was visible,
this expression was not as strong as in fibroblastic cells.
VEGF positive cells were more abundant in AT 2 -KO
mouse tumors than in wild type mouse tumors (4.2 vs.
7.8/field, respectively, P = 0.15), although the difference
between two groups was not statistically significant due
to large variation. These results suggest that faster
tumor growth in AT2-KO mice may be associated with
development of tumor microvasculature. Results further

Ang II receptor expression in wild-type MSF and PAN02 cells was determined by
real-time PCR and expressed as threshold cycle (Ct) value. The 18S ribosomal
RNA was used as an internal standard. The Ct value indicates the fractional cycle
number at which the amount of amplified target reaches a fixed threshold. Cells
were cultured in either serum-containing or serum-free medium for two days,
total RNA was extracted, and the receptor expression was determined. The
values represent the average of triplicate determinations. Serum-free culture is
known to increase AT2 expression in cultured cells [34].

Figure 2 Cell proliferation in tumor tissues was analyzed by counting anti-Ki-67 antibody positive cells in wild type (A) and in AT2-KO

suggest that the tumor stromal fibroblasts may play an
important role in tumor growth.
Angiotensin II stimulated growth of PAN02 cells cocultured with fibroblasts, and this stimulation was further
increased by an AT2 receptor specific antagonist

To evaluate the effects of Ang II and the AT2 receptor
signaling on the growth of PAN02 cells in vitro, the
effect of a low concentration of Ang II (10 nM) was
examined on the growth of PAN02 cells co-cultured
with MSFs prepared from either wild type or AT2-KO
mice or with AT2 receptor over-expressing MSFs prepared from either wild type or AT2-KO mice. Since AT2
receptor expression is known to be attenuated in culture
[34], AT2 receptor expression should be assured by the
receptor over-expression. As shown in Figure 5, growth
of PAN02 was significantly attenuated when the AT 2
receptor was over-expressed in co-cultured MSFs. Ang
II only slightly increased the growth of PAN02 cells
regardless of cell sources (wild type or AT2-KO mice)

or AT2 expression in MSFs. However, Ang II significantly increased cell growth of PAN02 co-cultured with
AT2-over-expressing MSFs when cells were treated with
the AT2 receptor-specific antagonist PD123319 (10 μM).
This AT 2 receptor blockade effect was not observed
when control Lac Z transfected MSFs were used in this
experiment (data not shown). Ang II or PD123319 treatment did not show any significant effect on the growth
of MSFs derived from either wild type or AT2-KO mice
(data not shown). These results indicate that AT 2
expression in co-cultured MSFs plays a negative role in
cell proliferation of PAN02 cells and this effect can be
reversed by the AT2 receptor blockade.
Angiotensin II attenuated VEGF production in fibroblasts,
and this attenuation was blocked by an AT2 receptor
specific antagonist

To evaluate a potential mechanism by which stromal
cells regulate PAN02 tumor growth, the effect of a low
concentration of Ang II (10 nM) on VEGF production

Figure 3 Apoptosis in tumor tissues was analyzed by visualizing TUNEL positive cells in wild type (A) and AT2-KO (B) mouse tumors.
Quantitative analysis of apoptosis (C) was carried out by counting TUNEL positive and negative cells in five random view fields; mean % positive
cells was calculated from this raw data for graphical presentation. Data are presented as percentages ± SEM of TUNEL positive cells/field. The

in wild type MSFs was examined. As shown in Figure 6,
Ang II attenuated VEGF protein expression in MSFs,
and this attenuation was completely blocked when cells
were pre-treated with the AT2 receptor-specific antagonist PD123319 (10 μM). PD123319 treatment alone
slightly increased VEGF expression in MSFs (Figure 6).
These results suggest that AT2-mediated Ang II signaling plays a negative role in VEGF expression in MSFs.
This may imply that Ang II-dependent regulation of
VEGF production in stromal cells may play an important role in PAN02 tumor growth.

Discussion
Increasing evidence suggests that Ang II signaling plays
an important role in carcinogenesis [15,19,22,35-37].
While AT 1 receptor over-expression has been implicated in many types of cancers including pancreatic

cáncer [11,12,38,39], the specific role of the AT 2
receptor in carcinogenesis has not been rigorously
elucidated. We have previously demonstrated the prooncogenic role of the AT 2 receptor in carcinogeninduced colon and lung tumorigenesis in the mouse.
In these models, the AT2 receptor appears to enhance
carcinogen metabolism and increase tumorigenesis.
However, the effect of AT2 receptor-mediated signaling
on tumor growth is unknown. Since Ang II has been
shown to stimulate tumor growth through the AT 1
receptor [35,39,40], and since the AT2 receptor antagonizes the AT 1 receptor [41,42], it is relevant to study
the role of the AT2 receptor in tumor growth. Therefore, in this study we sought to evaluate the role of
AT 2 receptor expression in stroma in the growth of
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, the most common
form of pancreatic cancer.

and AT2 over-expressing AT2-KO fibroblasts AT2AT2KO, hashed bars). Untransfected or AT2 transfected primary cultured mouse skin
fibroblasts were cultured one day prior to the initiation of PAN02 co-culture. The ratio of fibroblasts to PAN02 cells was 1:4. The cells were
treated with Ang II (10 nM) in the presence or absence of the AT2-specific antagonist PD123,319 (10 μM) as indicated in the figure. Cell
proliferation was determined 72 h after Ang II treatment by MTT assay as described in the Methods. The average (means ± SEM) of three
separate experiments is displayed in the histogram. Cell proliferation of PAN02 co-cultured with AT2 over-expressing fibroblasts was significantly
lower than that with untransfected fibroblasts regardless of the cell source (*, P ≤ 0.05), whereas PAN02 proliferation was significantly increased
when cells were treated with the AT2 antagonist PD123,319 (** P ≤ 0.01).

In the first study, we have examined the growth of
PAN02 adenocarcinoma cells in AT2-KO and wild type
mice and found that the growth of PAN02 xenografts is
significantly faster in AT2-KO mice than in wild type
mice (Figure 1). The degree of cell proliferation and the
index of apoptosis were measured by anti-Ki-67 staining
and TUNEL assay, respectively. It was found that
anti-Ki-67 positive staining was significantly higher in
AT2-KO mouse tumors than in wild type mouse tumors
(Figure 2). It was also observed that the index of apoptosis is slightly higher in the wild type mouse tumors
than in AT2-KO mouse tumors, although there was no
statistical difference between the two groups (Figure 3).
In addition, tumor vessel density was significantly higher
in AT2-KO mice than in wild type mice (Figure 4). At a
glance, the in vivo results show that growth of PAN02
cells was significantly faster in the AT2-KO environment
than in the wild type environment, most likely due to a
high degree of cell proliferation. Higher tumor vessel

density may also be associated with faster tumor growth
in the AT2-KO mice.
Following the in vivo mouse study, in vitro studies
were carried out to determine the mechanism by which
AT2 receptor expression in stromal cells modifies the
growth of pancreatic carcinoma cells. In the first in vitro
experiment, the effect of AT2 receptor over-expression
in either wild type or AT2-KO MSFs was evaluated in
co-culture with PAN02 cells. Results clearly indicate
that AT2 receptor over-expression significantly attenuates growth of co-cultured PAN02 cells. However, this
attenuation was completely abolished by the addition of
a low concentration of Ang II in the presence of the
AT 2 receptor-specific blocker PD123319 (Figure 5).
Since the contribution of MSFs to cell proliferation is
approximately one third of the total cell proliferation
(MSF + PAN02), since MSF cell proliferation was not
influenced by the status of AT 2 receptor expression
(Figure 5) nor by the presence of Ang II or the AT 2

Figure 6 The effect of Ang II and an AT2 receptor antagonist on VEGF protein expression in mouse fibroblasts was determined by
Western blot analysis. Primary cultured mouse skin fibroblasts were treated with Ang II (10 nM) in the presence or absence of the AT1- and
AT2-specific antagonists Losartan (1 μM) and PD123,319 (10 μM), respectively, as indicated in the figure. VEGF protein was determined 48 h after
Ang II treatment by Western blot analysis as described in the Methods. The average (means ± SEM) of two separate experiments is displayed in
the histogram. Ang II attenuated VEGF expression (P = 0.1), but this attenuation was completely blocked by the AT2 antagonist PD123,319.
However, PD123,319 treatment significantly increased VEGF production as compared to untreated control (*, P ≤ 0.05).

antagonist (data not shown), and since PAN02 cells do
not express Ang II receptors, the growth of PAN02 cells
appears to be indirectly regulated by the MSFs. This
experiment nicely recapitulates results obtained from
the mouse study (Figure 1). Furthermore, VEGF expression in MSFs was shown to be suppressed by Ang IIAT 2 receptor signaling (Figure 6), implying that AT 2
receptor expression-dependent growth attenuation may
be mediated by the attenuation of VEGF production in
stromal fibroblasts. In support of this, the VEGF positive

cell numbers were higher in AT 2 -KO mouse tumors
than in the wild type mouse tumors (Figure 4). Taken
together, these results strongly suggest that AT2 receptor signaling in stromal cells plays an important role in
inhibition of tumor growth. As this research shows,
tumor growth regulation is indirectly controlled through
stromal cells. The significance of tumor stromal cells in
tumor growth is widely accepted [43] and further
emphasized by another recent report [44]. The mechanism by which tumor stromal fibroblasts regulate tumor

Doi et al. BMC Cancer 2010, 10:67

growth has not been rigorously studied. However, Sugimoto et al. suggest that hepatocyte growth factor produced in fibroblasts controls tumor growth[45]. Since
Ang II is known to be produced in fibroblasts and acts
as a local cell growth regulator [10,15], it is reasonable
to speculate that Ang II also plays a role as a local mediator for tumor growth. In support of this speculation,
Fujimoto et al. [39] have reported AT1 receptor overexpression in human pancreatic cancer tissues and AT1
receptor-mediated growth regulation in pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, Anandanadesan has also reported
that Ang II stimulates VEGF expression in a panel of
human pancreatic cancer cell lines [38]. The present
study also indicates that tumor stromal fibroblasts
appear to be a rich source of VEGF (Figure 4).
It is well known that the Ang II receptor has two
major isoforms, and their signaling is associated with
cell proliferation and apoptosis [20]. The major isoform,
the AT1 receptor, is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, and its signaling functions in a variety of pathophysiological reactions, including constriction of blood
vessels, induction of cell proliferation and expression of
proto-oncogenes such as c-fos, c-myc and c-jun [46].
The second major isoform, the AT2 receptor, is abundantly expressed in fetal tissues, but its expression
declines rapidly after birth [14]. Multiple studies have
shown that AT2 receptor signaling counteracts the biological effects mediated by AT1 receptor signaling,
including inhibition of cell proliferation [41,42,47].
Therefore, the delicate balance between the activities of
these two receptors plays an important role in the
pathophysiology of various diseases[20]. Accordingly,
AT2 receptor-deficiency-induced tumor growth stimulation may be mediated at least in part through Ang IIAT1 receptor signaling in either stromal cells or cancer
cells. Indeed, it has been well documented that Ang II,
besides its conventional physiological actions, displays
characteristics of a growth factor [48]. The AT2 receptor signaling-dependent cell growth attenuation
reported here is in good agreement with earlier studies
[41,49]. In these studies, growth of vascular endothelial
cells and smooth muscle cells were shown to be attenuated by AT 2 receptor-mediated Ang II signaling.
Although these studies did not clarify the potential second messenger that controls cell growth, the present
study suggests that AT2 receptor-mediated attenuation
of VEGF production is a potential mechanism for AT2
receptor expression-dependent growth attenuation of
pancreatic carcinoma.
Based on observations by other researchers
[20,21,48,50,51] and findings in the present study, it is
clear that the AT2 receptor plays an important role in
tumor growth in rodents. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first report to describe the involvement of

Page 11 of 13

AT 2 receptor mediated signaling in controlling the
growth of pancreatic adenocarcinoma at least in part by
attenuating stromal fibroblast-dependent VEGF production. However, whether AT2 receptor expression indeed
plays an important role in human pancreatic cancer
growth must be clarified by human clinical studies.

Conclusion
The present study clearly indicates that the Ang II-AT2
receptor signaling plays an important role in the growth
regulation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Thus, it is
suggested that the AT2 receptor could be an important
target for cancer therapy/chemoprevention.
