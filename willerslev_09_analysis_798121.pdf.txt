Abstract
Background: The scientific literature contains many examples where DNA sequence analyses
have been used to provide definitive answers to phylogenetic problems that traditional (non-DNA
based) approaches alone have failed to resolve. One notable example concerns the rhinoceroses, a
group for which several contradictory phylogenies were proposed on the basis of morphology,
then apparently resolved using mitochondrial DNA fragments.
Results: In this study we report the first complete mitochondrial genome sequences of the
extinct ice-age woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis), and the threatened Javan (Rhinoceros
sondaicus), Sumatran (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis), and black (Diceros bicornis) rhinoceroses. In
combination with the previously published mitochondrial genomes of the white (Ceratotherium
simum) and Indian (Rhinoceros unicornis) rhinoceroses, this data set putatively enables reconstruction of the rhinoceros phylogeny. While the six species cluster into three strongly supported
sister-pairings: (i) The black/white, (ii) the woolly/Sumatran, and (iii) the Javan/Indian, resolution of
the higher-level relationships has no statistical support. The phylogenetic signal from individual
genes is highly diffuse, with mixed topological support from different genes. Furthermore, the
choice of outgroup (horse vs tapir) has considerable effect on reconstruction of the phylogeny. The
lack of resolution is suggestive of a hard polytomy at the base of crown-group Rhinocerotidae, and
this is supported by an investigation of the relative branch lengths.
Conclusion: Satisfactory resolution of the rhinoceros phylogeny may not be achievable without
additional analyses of substantial amounts of nuclear DNA. This study provides a compelling

demonstration that, in spite of substantial sequence length, there are significant limitations with
single-locus phylogenetics. We expect further examples of this to appear as next-generation, largescale sequencing of complete mitochondrial genomes becomes commonplace in evolutionary
studies.
"The human factor in classification is nowhere more evident than in dealing with this superfamily
(Rhinocerotoidea)." G. G. Simpson (1945)

Background
Despite being a long-standing target of scientific research,
resolution of the phylogeny of the five living rhinoceroses
using traditional (non-DNA) approaches has been controversial. At the root of the problem is the placement of the
Sumatran rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis), a species
that has retained many ancestral morphological characters,
among the broadly accepted sub-clades of the black (Diceros
bicornis) and white (Ceratotherium simum) rhinoceroses, and
the Javan (Rhinoceros sondaicus) and Indian (Rhinoceros
unicornis) rhinoceroses. For example, on the one hand, the
two horns of the Sumatran rhinoceros suggest that it should
be placed with the similarly two-horned black and white
rhinoceroses, rather than with the single-horned Javan and
Indian rhinoceroses [1,2]. On the other hand, the geographic distribution of the Sumatran rhinoceros, and its
close proximity with the two other living Asian species,
would indicate that they form a natural clade [3]. Third, a
hard trichotomy has been proposed, reflecting an effectively
simultaneous divergence of the three lineages [4-6].
Attempts to resolve such questions can be made by
including fossil taxa, for example the woolly rhinoceros in
this case. However, this has proven to be similarly
problematic. Although it seems clear that the woolly and
Sumatran are closely related (for example both have two
horns and a hairy pelt), the addition of morphological
information from the woolly rhinoceros has failed to
produce a convincing resolution of the relationships
among the three pairs.
In response to these problems, several DNA-based
studies have been undertaken on the rhinoceroses in
an attempt to resolve the phylogeny. The first such study
used restriction-digest mapping of mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) ribosomal region to find weak support
(maximum parsimony bootstrap support of 57%) for
the extant rhinoceros phylogeny as outlined on the basis
of horn morphology [7]. As larger amounts of data were
incorporated into the analyses, however, this picture was
modified – using complete 12S rRNA and cytochrome b
sequences, Tougard et al. [8] found high support
(maximum likelihood bootstrap support of 97%) for
the phylogeny as outlined by geography (although they
could not, using a Kishino-Hasegawa test, reject outright
the horn topology). More recently, Orlando et al. [9]

analysed ancient DNA to confirm the monophyly of the
woolly-Sumatran rhinoceros pairing using complete 12S
rRNA and partial cytochrome b gene sequences (maximum likelihood bootstrap support between 93–100%).
Furthermore, in agreement with the work of Tougard et al.
[8], their inferred phylogeny groups the woolly-Sumatran
pair with the Javan-Indian pair, but with <50% bootstrap
support. Thus the results of these later studies appeared to
be an excellent illustration of the advantages of molecular
sequence analysis over more traditional approaches,
when resolving subtle phylogenetic questions.
Despite the successful results, however, one of the key
lessons of the above is that even when using DNA data,
results can still be misleading without sufficiently large
amounts of sequence. It has previously been advocated
that phylogenies based on single genes can sometimes
yield falsely supported results [10]. The variation in
phylogenetic signal among mitochondrial genes in
elephantids provides a compelling illustration of this
problem [11]. In addition, Cummings et al. [12]
analysed complete genomes and subsamples of them,
concluding that small increases in sequence length will
greatly increase the chance of finding the correct wholegenome tree when sequence lengths are below 3,000
base-pairs (bp). In light of this, the clearly controversial
phylogeny of the Rhinocerotidae, and the fact that
previous studies have maximally been based on the
2,146 bp of the combined 12S rRNA and cytochrome b
genes, we have revisited the molecular analysis using six
complete mtDNA genome sequences of the five extant,
and extinct woolly, rhinoceroses. Specifically, we have
generated, using our previously published approach of
utilising keratinous tissues as a high-quality source of
mtDNA for sequencing on the FLX platform [13-15],
four novel complete mitochondrial genomes (from the
black, woolly, Javan, and Sumatran rhinoceroses). With
the addition of the published mtDNA genomes of the
white [GenBank:Y07726] [16] and Indian [Genbank:
X97336.1] [17] rhinoceroses, the six genomes cover all
the living and one extinct member of the rhinocerotid
family. We demonstrate that phylogenetic analysis of the
complete mtDNA genomes, as well as individual
analyses of the constituent genes, questions the findings
of the previous molecular reports.

Results
Mitochondrial genome sequences
The four newly sequenced mitochondrial genomes are
similar to the two previously published rhinoceros mitochondrial genomes, consisting of 13 protein-coding genes, 22
tRNA genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and a control region.
The exact length is difficult to determine due to the presence
of variable tandem repeats in the control; the consecutive
repeats are longer than the read length of the Roche FLX, so we
are unable characterise them. The sequences have been
submitted to GenBank with accession numbers FJ905813
(woolly rhinoceros), FJ905814 (black rhinoceros), FJ905815
(Javan rhinoceros) and FJ905816 (Sumatran rhinoceros).

An obvious power of complete mtDNA genome sequencing
is that it enables functional assessment and comparison of
the genes between the taxa [14,18]. Mitochondrial proteincoding genes are involved in oxidative phosphorylation,
which is responsible for the production of up to 95% of the
energy of eukaryotic cells, and modifications in these genes
have been associated with the improvement of aerobic
capacity and adaptation to new thermal environments
[19,20]. Furthermore, mutations in mitochondrial genes
have been implicated in exercise intolerance in humans
[21]. We have mapped the amino acid differences between
the rhinoceroses on the available crystallographic structures
for mitochondrial-encoded proteins, those for cytb [22] and
co1, co2, and co3 [23].
Despite some of the differences occurring in functionally
relevant sites (boxed residues in the alignment, orange
spheres in the structure; Figures S1 and S2: Additional
Files 1 and 2), we were unable to observe any direct
relationship between them and the markedly different
environments inhabited by the woolly, in contrast to the
extant rhinoceroses.

Phylogeny and speciation times of the rhinoceros
The mitochondrial genomes of the six rhinoceros species
were analysed using Bayesian and likelihood-based phylogenetic methods. In order to infer the position of the root,
the sequences of two perissodactylan outgroup species were
included in the analyses (tapir, Tapirus terrestris; and horse,
Equus caballus). We find very strong support for each of the
three sister-species pairings among the rhinoceroses (100%
Bayesian posterior probability and maximum-likelihood
bootstrap support, regardless of the choice of outgroup).
This is in agreement with previous molecular findings and
most morphological reports.

Split decomposition produced a graph with good
representation of the phylogenetic signal (fit value =
89.64), but with an obvious lack of resolution among
the three pairs of rhinoceros species (Figure 1). Similar

graphs were produced using split decomposition with
other distance measures, including LogDet-transformed
distances (results not shown).
Bayesian and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses of the concatenated data set revealed mixed support
for three candidate topologies (Table 1). The relative
topological support varied according to outgroup choice,
although support was generally weak. In only one case
(Bayesian analysis with horse outgroup) was there
significant support for a particular tree topology. Likelihood-based tree topology tests, performed using the
concatenated alignment with both outgroups, yielded no
significant support for any particular tree topology. There
was slight (but non-significant) support in favour of the
topology in which the white, black, Sumatran, and woolly
rhinoceroses group together to the exclusion of the Indian
and Javan rhinoceroses (approximately-unbiased test p =
0.716, Kishino-Hasegawa test p = 0.663, ShimodairaHasegawa test p = 0.802). There was low support for the
grouping of the white, black, Indian, and Javan rhinoceroses (AU-test p = 0.398, KH-test p = 0.337, SH-test p =
0.473), and for the grouping of the Indian, Javan,
Sumatran, and woolly rhinoceroses (AU-test p = 0.154,
KH-test p = 0.151, SH-test p = 0.245). Regardless of the
topology test used, all three candidate topologies were
always included in the 95% confidence set.
Analyses using individual components of the mitochondrial genome revealed wide variations in relative support
for the three candidate topologies (Figures 2, 3, 4).

Bayesian estimates of divergence times within Rhinocerotidae, calculated using two fossil-based calibrations,
were similar across different tree topologies (Table 2).
The estimated age of the common ancestor of the six
rhinoceros taxa was around 30 Myr, with a 95% highest
posterior density (HPD) interval of about 28–33 Myr.
The next divergence within the group occurred only
around 1.0–1.5 Myr afterwards, with a very considerable
overlap in the 95% HPD intervals of these two adjacent
nodes (nodes A and B in Table 2). On average across the
three topologies, the mean time separating these two
nodes represents only 3.78% of the total tree height.

Discussion
As ancient DNA techniques have advanced, the complete
mitochondrial genomes of extinct taxa are now regularly
being included in DNA analyses. Initial complete ancient
mtDNA genomes were generated using conventional
overlapping-PCR and Sanger sequencing techniques,
yielding the mtDNA genomes of three moa species
(Emeus crassus, Anomalopteryx didiformis, and Dinornis
giganticus) [24,25], several woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) [26,27], and the mastodon (Mammut
americanum) [11]. These genomes were successfully used
to resolve long-standing phylogenetic questions, including the ratite and Elephantidae phylogenies. Notably,
both questions were those for which prior analysis of
smaller mitochondrial and nuclear fragments had
yielded contradicting results [28-33]. In light of these

successes, therefore, our inconclusive findings come as a
surprise. Previous morphological studies, along with
restriction enzyme mapping studies, have supported the
horn-based topology grouping the black and white
rhinoceroses with the Sumatran and woolly rhinoceroses
[1,2,7]. More recent studies of morphological and DNA
data have favoured the geography-based topology,
grouping all the Asian species together to the exclusion
of the African species [3,8]. With the complete mitochondrial genomes, however, the third possible candidate grouping (the African species together with the
Indian and Javan rhinoceroses) cannot be statistically
rejected.
The discrepancy between the results of the present and
previous studies led us to investigate the topologies
supported by each individual mitochondrial gene. The
signal varied considerably among genes, with 3–7 genes
supporting each of the three candidate topologies
(Figures 1, 2, 3, 4). The considerable heterogeneity in
topological support among mitochondrial genes is
unusual due to the non-recombining mode of genomic
transmission, but echoes similar results obtained for
elephantids [11] and for chloroplast genes in Asplenium
ferns [34]. A possible explanation for the lack of
resolution could be the short divergence time among
the three sister-species pairings of only ~1 Myr, leaving
little time to accumulate mutations in the ancestral
branches; thus, the poor resolution might be indicative
of a hard polytomy. The cause of the multiple defining
speciation events of the rhinoceros family is unknown,
but can be identified as having occurred during the early
Oligocene (33.9 ± 0.1 – 28.4 ± 0.1 Myr ago). A less likely
explanation for the lack of phylogenetic resolution,
posited by Shepherd et al. [34] to explain the phylogenetic conflicts among chloroplast genes in ferns, is that
recombination might have occurred in the rhinocerotid
mitochondrial genome. Finally, it is possible that the
mitochondrial tree does not provide an accurate reflection of the underlying species phylogeny, a question that
will need to be addressed using data from multiple
nuclear loci.

Conclusion
We have demonstrated that, in addition to hair, nail is
an excellent substrate with which complete mitochondrial genomes can be generated from old or ancient
material. Using these substrates we have generated the
sequences of four previously unpublished rhinoceros
mtDNA genomes. Although several previous studies of
partial mtDNA genomic sequences apparently resolved
the long-standing question as to the true phylogeny of
the recent rhinoceros species, we have demonstrated that
these estimates were probably misled by sampling error.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/95

Furthermore, even when using complete mitochondrial
sequences, we are unable to resolve the tree topology.
Thus, for the rhinoceroses at least, DNA analyses have
not yet been able to provide a solution to the
evolutionary history of this challenging taxon. Several
possible steps might be taken to resolve this problem.
One would be the inclusion of DNA sequences recovered
from a more closely related outgroup species, such as
members of the Elasmotherium genus. Unfortunately
however, the age of known specimens likely precludes
the survival of DNA in them. Thus it is probable that
satisfactory resolution of the phylogeny will instead
require the incorporation of substantial amounts of
nuclear DNA data.

Methods
Samples
In our previous studies [13-15,35,36], we have reported
the benefit of using hair shaft as a source of enriched,
pure mtDNA, from which complete mitochondrial
genomes can be rapidly sequenced using the Roche
FLX technology. We have previously argued that the
benefits derive principally from the keratin structure of
the material. In this study we have used hair shaft, and
have explored the properties of a similarly keratinous
tissue, nail. Specifically, ancient permafrost-preserved
hair shaft was used for the woolly rhinoceros, while
modern hair shaft was donated by Cincinnatti Zoo
(USA) for the Sumatran rhinoceros. The woolly rhinoceros hair was excavated from the permafrost near the
Taimylyr village, not far from the Arctic Ocean coast
(Yakutia, Olenyok River valley, 72.61°N and 121.93°E)
in 2002 and is kept in the Lena Delta Reserve in Tiksi; the
age of this specimen is not known. For the black and
Javan rhinoceroses (the latter not found in captivity) we
used historic museum toenail samples, dated to approximately 100 years old, and provided by the Zoological
Museum, University of Copenhagen (Denmark), and the
Oxford University Museum of Natural History (England), respectively. In these cases, powdered nail was
obtained by drilling directly into the nails. Full sample
details are given in Table 3.
Extractions and sequencing
Prior to DNA extraction, hair shaft was thoroughly
cleansed in 10% commercial bleach solution following
Gilbert et al. [13]. The powdered nail was likewise
incubated in 10% commercial bleach solution for 5
minutes, prior to pelleting through a centrifugation step.
Subsequently the bleach was poured off, and the pellet
was thoroughly washed three times in ddH20 to remove
all traces of the bleach. Both hair and nail material were
digested and DNA was subsequently purified following
Gilbert et al. [13]. Specifically, digestion of the hair shafts

between 10 and 40 ml of the following digestion buffer:
10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM NaCl2, 2% w/v
Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS), 5 mM CaCl2, 2.5 mM
Ethylene-Diamine-Tetra-Acetic acid (EDTA), pH 8.0), 40
mM Dithiothreitol (DTT; Cleland's reagent) and 10%
proteinase K solution (>600 mAU/ml, Qiagen). Post
digestion DNA was purified twice with phenol and once
with chloroform following standard protocols. The
aqueous, DNA-containing solution was concentrated to
200 μl using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units
with a 10 kD filter (Millipore).
Library construction, DNA sequencing, and assembly
The DNA libraries from four rhinoceros species were
constructed as previously described [37], by shearing
genomic DNA into fragments which were blunt-ended
and phosphorylated by enzymatic polishing using T4
DNA polymerase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and E. coli
DNA polymerase. The polished DNA fragments were
then subjected to adapter ligation, followed by isolation
of the single-stranded template DNA (sstDNA). The
quality and quantity of the sstDNA library was assessed
using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Each sstDNA library fragment was
captured onto a single DNA capture bead, and was
clonally amplified within individual emulsion droplets.
The emulsions were disrupted using isopropanol, the
beads without an amplified sstDNA fragment were
removed, and the beads with an amplified sstDNA
fragment were recovered for sequencing. The recovered
sstDNA beads were packed onto a 70 × 75 mm
PicoTiterPlate™ and loaded onto the Roche FLX Sequencing System (Roche Applied-Sciences, Indianapolis, IN)
as previously described. In total, 70,082 reads were
generated for woolly rhinoceros, 565,065 for Sumatran
rhinoceros, 251,087 for black rhinoceros, and 96,900 for
Javan rhinoceros. Sequencing reads from each project
were aligned using the complete mitochondrial genome
from the white rhinoceros as a reference [GenBank:
Y07726].

The DNA libraries from the four new samples yielded
between 0.41 and 6.6% mtDNA sequences (Table 3), as
identified through alignment with the white rhinoceros

mitochondrial genome. The remaining sequence composition was not analysed in detail, due to difficulties
associated with a lack of closely related nuclear genome
against which to compare the results. The data indicate
that, as a source of ancient mtDNA, nail is comparable to
hair. Furthermore, the mtDNA yield of the woolly
rhinoceros sample is the highest observed from any
hair shaft studied to date.
The mtDNA genomes of the taxa were assembled using
the white rhinoceros mtDNA genome as a guide,
analogous to the method of Gilbert et al. [13]. A
frequently reported problem in conventional (i.e., PCRbased) ancient mtDNA studies (in particular for the
woolly rhinoceros [9]) is the PCR amplification of
numts, and their subsequent erroneous designation as
true mtDNA sequences. This is not, however, a problem
with FLX generated sequences for reasons argued
previously [13], that principally relate to the differences
between the shot-gun nature of FLX emPCR and
sequencing and the targeted nature of PCR based
amplification. Thus we are confident the data represents
the true mtDNA sequence. The genomes could be
assembled as single contigs for the woolly, Javan, and
black rhinoceroses, while that of the Javan rhinoceros,
which yielded the lowest levels of mtDNA in this data
set, was initially assembled into 15 contigs. Traditional
PCR and Sanger sequencing was thus applied to the
extract, both to ensure the sequence accuracy of the
regions that had low levels of FLX coverage (<3×), and to
fill in the missing data (Table S1: Additional File 3).
Sequence alignment and partitioning
The mitochondrial genomes of the six rhinoceroses were
aligned manually. The variable number tandem repeats
(VNTRs) in the D-loop were removed, leaving a data set
of 16,323 aligned sites. A matrix containing uncorrected
pairwise distances for the six mitochondrial genomes is
provided in Table S2 (Additional File 4), with details of
informative sites given in Table S3 (Additional File 5).

To allow the position of the root to be inferred,
mitochondrial genome sequences from the horse
(Equus caballus [GenBank:X79547] [38]) and lowland
tapir (Tapirus terrestris [GenBank:AJ428947],

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:95

unpublished data deposition in Genbank [39]), were
added to the alignment. The resulting data set includes
representatives from all three families of Order Perissodactyla: Rhinocerotidae, Tapiridae, and Equidae.
Analyses including additional representatives of Laurasiatheria were performed, without yielding qualitatively
different results, are not presented here but are summarised in Table S4 (Additional File 6).
We constructed a concatenated data set (13,714 bp),
with the following five partitions: (i) first codon sites of
the 13 protein-coding genes; (ii) second codon sites of
protein-coding genes; (iii) third codon sites of proteincoding genes; (iv) loop regions of 12S and 16S rRNA
genes; and (v) D-loop. The RNA loop regions were
defined in accordance with the RNA secondary structural
models of Ceratotherium simum available from the
European Ribosomal RNA Database [40]. The D-loop
was defined using the GenBank annotation of Ceratotherium simum. Other sections of the mitochondrial genomes, including the RNA stems, tRNA genes, and
intergenic sites were not used for further study, except
in the split decomposition analysis.
Split decomposition
To examine the overall phylogenetic signal, we analysed
the alignment of complete mitochondrial genomes
(excluding the VNTRs) using the software SplitsTree 4
[41]. Pairwise distances were estimated with the GTR+I
+G model of nucleotide substitution, using maximumlikelihood estimates of model parameters. Using the
split decomposition method [42], the data were canonically decomposed into a sum of weakly compatible splits
and represented in the form of a splits graph.
Phylogenetic analysis
We performed a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of the
concatenated sequence alignment using MrBayes 3.1 [43].
A separate substitution model was assumed for each of
the five data partitions, with substitution models selected
by comparison of Bayesian information criterion scores
(Table S3). Posterior distributions of parameters, including the tree topology, were estimated using Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with two chains (one
heated). Samples from the posterior were drawn every
1,000 MCMC steps over a total of 11,000,000 steps, with
the first 1,000 samples discarded as burn-in. Acceptable
mixing and convergence to the stationary distribution
were checked using Tracer 1.4 [44].

To examine the effect of outgroup choice, we ran two
further phylogenetic analyses, excluding the horse and
tapir sequences in turn. All other settings were identical
to those of the original analysis.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/95

Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis was also
performed on the concatenated data sets, using the
software PAUP* 4b10 [45]. As with the Bayesian
analyses, different combinations of outgroup taxa were
tested (horse, tapir, and both). The GTR+I+G model of
nucleotide substitution was assumed, with six rate
categories for the discrete gamma distribution. Each
data partition was allowed to have a unique substitution
rate. In each analysis, the maximum-likelihood tree was
identified using a branch-and-bound search. To assess
levels of support for different nodes in the tree, bootstrap
analysis was conducted with 1,000 pseudoreplicates.
Topology tests were performed in a maximum-likelihood
framework using the program Consel [46]. This program
implements the approximately-unbiased test [47], the
Kishino-Hasegawa test [48], and the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test [49], among others. We used these to assess the
relative confidence in three competing topological
hypotheses (see Table 2). Site-wise log likelihoods were
calculated using PAUP, with the same settings as for the
analysis of the concatenated data described above.
To investigate variations in phylogenetic signal among
different genes, Bayesian and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses were performed for each protein-coding
gene, rRNA gene (loops only), and the D-loop. Both
outgroup taxa (horse and tapir) were included. Substitution
models were chosen by comparison of Bayesian information criterion scores (Table S3). The same settings were used
as for the analyses of the concatenated data set.

Divergence time estimation
Rhinocerotid divergence times were estimated by Bayesian
phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated sequence alignment, using both horse and tapir as the outgroup. The
alignment was analysed using an uncorrelated lognormal
relaxed-clock model in BEAST 1.4.7 [50,51]. As with the
MrBayes analysis, a separate substitution model was
assumed for each of the five data partitions, with substitution models selected by comparison of Bayesian information criterion scores (Table S3). The tree topology was fixed,
with a separate analysis performed for each of the three
candidate trees (see Table 2). Posterior distributions of
parameters were estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) sampling. Samples from the posterior were drawn
every 1,000 MCMC steps over a total of 5,500,000 steps,
with the first 500 samples discarded as burn-in. Acceptable
mixing and convergence to the stationary distribution were
checked using Tracer.

In order to place a geological time-scale on the
phylogenetic tree, two calibrations were taken from the
fossil record. First, a lognormal prior (minimum 56 Myr,

Page 8 of 11
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:95

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/95

mean 60 Myr, standard deviation 1.51 Myr) was
specified for the age of the root [52,53]. This is probably
the most appropriate summarisation of paleontological
information because the probability density of the nodal
age has a mode that is older than the age of the oldest
fossil belonging to either of the lineages descending
from the node [54]. Second, a minimum age constraint
of 16 Myr was placed on the Dicerorhinus lineage [55].

Phylogenetic analyses were performed on first and second codon positions
only, using an unpartitioned GTR+I+G substitution model. Other
settings in the Bayesian and likelihood-based analyses were as described
in the main text, the only exceptions being the use of the heuristic treebisection-reconnection instead of a branch-and-bound search in the
maximum-likelihood analysis, and the calculation of the bootstrap
support values from 200 pseudoreplicates rather than 1,000.
