Abstract
Background: Protein-protein interaction has been used to complement traditional sequence
homology to elucidate protein function. Most existing approaches only make use of direct
interactions to infer function, and some have studied the application of indirect interactions for
functional inference but are unable to improve prediction performance. We have previously
proposed an approach, FS-Weighted Averaging, which uses topological weighting and level-2
indirect interactions (protein pairs connected via two interactions) for predicting protein function
from protein interactions and have found that it yields predictions with superior precision on yeast
proteins over existing approaches. Here we study the use of this technique to predict functional
annotations from the Gene Ontology for seven genomes: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila
melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, and Homo
sapiens.
Results: Our analysis shows that protein-protein interactions provide supplementary coverage
over sequence homology in the inference of protein function and is definitely a complement to
sequence homology. We also find that FS-Weighted Averaging consistently outperforms two
classical approaches, Neighbor Counting and Chi-Square, across the seven genomes for all three
categories of the Gene Ontology. By randomly adding and removing interactions from the
interactions, we find that Weighted Averaging is also rather robust against noisy interaction data.
Conclusion: We have conducted a comprehensive study over seven genomes. We conclude that
FS-Weighted Averaging can effectively make use of indirect interactions to make the inference of
protein functions from protein interactions more effective. Furthermore, the technique is general
enough to work over a variety of genomes.

Background
Although sequence similarity search has proven useful in
many cases, it has fundamental limitations. First, only a

fraction of newly discovered sequences have identifiable
homologous genes in current databases. Second, the most
prominent vertebrate organisms in GenBank have only a

fraction of their genomes present in finished sequences.
New bioinformatics methods allow inference of protein
function using "associative analysis" of functional properties to complement traditional sequence homology-based
methods. Associative properties that have been used to
infer function not evident from sequence homology
include: co-occurrence of proteins in operons or genome
context [1-3]; proteins sharing common domains in
fusion proteins [4-6]; proteins with similar phylogenetic
profiles [7,8]; proteins with correlated gene expression
patterns [9]; and so on. Many approaches have also been
proposed for utilizing protein-protein interaction data for
functional inference [10-18]. A simple but effective
approach is to assign a protein with the function that
occurs most frequently in its interaction partners [10].
This is further improved in [11], which predicts function
based on chi-square statistics instead of frequency. Some
approaches apply machine-learning methods such as clustering and support vector machines [12-14]. Others apply
global optimization techniques, such as Markov random
fields [15,16] and simulated annealing [17], to propagate
predictions so that the function of proteins without characterized neighbors can be predicted. Most of these
approaches use the observation that a protein often shares
functions with proteins that interact with it (i.e., its level1 neighbors). However, proteins that interact with the
same proteins (i.e., level-2 neighbors) may also have a
greater likelihood of sharing similar physical or biochemical characteristics with the target protein. In a previous
study [18], we investigated interactions between proteins
from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (bakers' yeast) genome
from the General Repository of Interaction Datasets
(GRID) [19]. We observed that there are proteins that do
not share any function with their immediate interaction
partners (i.e., level-1 neighbors, S1) and yet share some
function similarity with the interaction partners of their
immediate partners (i.e., level-2 neighbors, S2). Out of
4,162 annotated yeast proteins, only 1,999, or 48.0%,
share some function with its level-1 neighbors. Of the
remaining proteins, 943, or 22.7% of the annotated proteins, share some similarity with at least one of its level-2
neighbors. Less than 2% of the annotated proteins share
functions exclusively with level-1 neighbors.
With the assumption that there is no unobserved interaction or annotation, we proposed indirect functional association as a reasonable explanation for this observation
[18]. Such an indirect functional association can be considered as an instance of the "guilt by association" principle – the common "property" between the level-2
neighbors and the target protein that is used for deriving
the "association" is precisely the set of proteins that they
both interact with, namely the level-1 neighbors. It is
plausible that two proteins that interact with a common
set of proteins have a good likelihood of sharing similar

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/S4/S8

physical or biochemical characteristics, and thus exhibit a
common function.
While level-2 neighbors may be used to provide greater
coverage during function inference, they contain too
many false positives to be useful. In order to reduce the
impact of these false positives, we devised a topological
weighting measure, Functional Similarity Weight (FSWeight), which can be used to identify both direct and
indirect (level-2) neighbors that are more likely to share
functions. FS-Weight improves the precision of function
inference, while the inclusion of FS-weighted level-2
neighbors improves both sensitivity and precision. A new
method, FS-Weighted Averaging, which incorporates indirect interactions and FS-Weight, was shown to perform
better than existing approaches in predicting protein functions for S. cerevisiae from protein interactions [18].
Here we study how FS-Weighted Averaging performs in
predicting protein functions from the protein-protein
interaction maps of seven genomes. We also study how
the approach performs on noisy interaction data and on
predicted interactions. Finally, we show some examples of
novel functions predicted for uncharacterized proteins in
the S. cerevisiae genome and study the predictions that are
biologically significant.

Results
Coverage of protein-protein interactions
To appreciate the feasibility of protein-protein interactions for function discovery, we want to find out whether
protein-protein interactions provide any additional coverage over sequence homology. We look at two well-studied
genomes, S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster, and examine:
1) how many known functions can be inferred from other
proteins with sequence similarity in the genome; 2) how
many more functions can be suggested from interaction
partners on top of (1); and 3) how many more functions
can be suggested from indirect interaction partners on top
of (1) and (2).

Each protein sequence is searched against all protein
sequences in the Gene Ontology Database [20] using the
Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) [21] using a
range of varying E-value thresholds between 1e-10 to 1. A
higher E-value will translate to less significant sequence
similarity and vice versa. Hence, a higher E-value threshold will provide better coverage at the expense of lower
precision. Proteins with close homologs (E-Value <= 1e25) from the homology search are excluded from the analysis. The protein interaction network is then examined to
find out the number of additional known annotations
that can be suggested from direct and indirect interactions. Figure 2 summarizes the findings of this analysis.
We find that protein-protein interactions can provide sub-

stantial coverage over annotations that cannot be inferred
from sequence homology, especially for biological process
and cellular component. We also observe that indirect interactions can provide significant additional coverage over
annotations that cannot be inferred from both sequence
homology and direct interactions.
Effectiveness of FS-Weight
The effectiveness of FS-Weighted Averaging for function
prediction depends upon the capability of FS-Weight in
assigning higher weights to direct and indirect interactions that involve function sharing. Here we study how
well FS-Weight scores reflect function similarity. All direct
and indirect interactions are first weighted using FSWeight. For each unique score, we compute the fraction of
interactions with weights higher than or equal to this
score that share at least one level-4 GO term. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between FS-Weight score and
this computed fraction is then computed. This coefficient
indicates how well the FS-Weight score of an interaction
correlates to the likelihood of function being shared
between the proteins involved. Table 2 summarizes the
corresponding Pearson's coefficient for each of the seven
genomes and each of the three GO categories. We can see
that the coefficient values are significant (>0.7) for most
cases, indicating that FS-Weight correlates strongly with
the likelihood of function sharing. The correlation is
lower for molecular function in the M. musculus and R.
norvegicus genomes, but the value is still positive, indicating weaker correlation. No results are available for the
molecular function and the cellular component of C. elegans due to limited annotation information.

Function prediction using FS-Weighted Averaging
Using Neighbor Counting and Chi-Square as a benchmark, we want to study the prediction performance of FSWeighted Averaging over a variety of different genomes.
These genomes vary greatly in the availability of annotations and interaction data, which provides a good setup to
study the strengths and limitations of the technique. Tenfold cross validation is performed on each genome using
Neighbor Counting, Chi-Square, and FS-Weighted Averaging. Proteins with known functions are randomly
divided into 10 groups. In each run, the annotations for
one group of proteins will be hidden, and their functions
predicted based on the annotations for the remaining
groups and the interaction data. The hidden annotations
are not available to any preprocessing steps, including
reliability estimation and the weighting of interactions.
The predictions from the three methods are validated and
compared using the two criteria, precision-recall analysis
and receiver operating characteristics, as outlined in the
Methods section. Only informative GO terms (see Methods) are used for validation.
Precision-recall Analysis
The precision versus recall graphs for the prediction of
informative GO terms for each of the seven genomes are
presented in Figure 3. Only graphs for the biological process category are presented to maintain clarity. Graphs
from the molecular function and cellular component categories are provided in the supplementary data (see Additional File 1). We can see from Figure 3 that FS-Weighted
Averaging makes predictions with better precision and
recall compared to the two other methods for most of the

The fraction of known functional annotations that can be suggested through BLAST homology search; and the additional annotations that can be suggested through: 1) direct protein interactions (PPI) and 2) indirect protein interactions. A range of BLAST E-value cutoffs between 1 to 1e-10 is used. BLAST is
performed on sequences from the gene ontology database. Proteins with very close homologs (E-value ≤ 1e-25) are excluded
from analysis. The top row shows the results from S. cerevisiae, and the bottom row shows the results from D. melanogaster.

seven genomes. The precision of FS-Weighted Averaging
for R. norvegicus is less consistent. However, note that due
to the lack of annotation information, the informative
terms chosen for three genomes, including R. norvegicus,
may not provide for statistically strong comparisons (see
Methods). For the prediction of informative GO terms
from the molecular function and cellular component categories, FS-Weighted Averaging also yields better recall
and precision over the two other (see Additional File 1).
For these categories, no result is available for C. elegans as
insufficient annotation information is available. We also
observe that the superiority of FS-Weighted Averaging
over the two other methods is more significant in the
genomes with denser interaction networks (i.e., S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster).
Receiver operating characteristics
To compare the receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
[22] of predictions from the three methods, we compute
the number of informative GO terms that can be predicted with an ROC ≥ k, 0.1 ≥ k ≥ 1. The number of GO
terms that can be predicted with ROC ≥ k is plotted against

k in Figure 4 using the three methods for the seven
genomes. Again, only graphs for GO terms from biological process are shown here. We can see that for most of the
genomes, FS-Weighted Averaging makes predictions for
more GO terms at each ROC threshold. We again observe
that the superiority of FS-Weighted Averaging over the two
other methods is more significant in the genomes with
denser interaction networks. Graphs for the two other GO
categories show similar results.
Function prediction with predicted protein-protein
interactions
One of the main limitations in using protein-protein
interactions for function prediction is the availability of
interaction data. If we can harness predicted interactions,
such as those from the STRING database [23], the use of
protein-protein interactions for functional inference
becomes potentially more useful. The STRING database
contains physical interactions as well as interactions predicted from genomic context, coexpression, and previous
knowledge. Here we include the interactions for S. cerevisiae from STRING into the existing interaction data from

BioGRID to study if any improvement can be made from
the use of these predicted interactions. Figure 5 shows the
precision-recall and ROC analysis of the predictions made
by the three methods using 1) only interactions from
BioGRID (50,434 unique interactions); and 2) a combination of BioGRID interactions and predicted interactions
from STRING (173,797 unique pairs) for informative GO
terms from the biological process category. We find that
Neighbor Counting and Chi-Square achieved significant
improvement in both precision-recall and ROC analysis
with the combined interactions, while the performance of
FS-Weighted Averaging remains relatively unchanged.
This is due to the fact that the predicted interactions from
STRING in fact already include many indirect interactions.
The average number of annotated neighbors per annotated protein is nearly 65 (see Table 1), which is much
higher than the average direct interaction partner per protein of 5 estimated in [24]. Nonetheless, FS-Weighted
Averaging is still able to achieve greater ROC for more
informative GO terms with the combined interaction
data. One interesting point to note is that FS-Weighted
Averaging can already achieve outstanding recall and precision as well as ROC performance using the much
smaller BioGRID, which is less than one-third the size of
the combined interactions!
Robustness of FS-Weighted Averaging against noise and
missing data
FS-Weighted Averaging is designed to take into account
the fact that interaction data can be rather noisy [25]. As
mentioned in the Methods section, the FS-Weight meas-

ure incorporates two forms of countermeasure against
noisy interaction data – estimation of the reliability of
experimental sources and topological weight. Here we
want to study how well the method can perform against
noisy data. To simulate noise in interactions, we take the
current interaction data and contaminate it with different
forms of synthetic noise. We perform this analysis on the
S. cerevisiae genome since it has a denser interaction data
and more complete functional annotations. To differentiate the effects of different types of noise, we modify the
interaction data by 1) adding random interactions and 2)
randomly removing interactions. Random additions
reflect false positives in experimental sources, while random deletions reflect missing data or detection failures.
Real protein-protein interactions are likely to include
both forms of noise.
FS-Weighted Averaging is used to predict functions from
the biological process category using interactions with
noise varying from 10% to 50% of the existing interactions applied. As a comparison, we repeated the predictions using Neighbor Counting. Figure 6 presents graphs
that show the number of informative GO terms that can
be predicted above various ROC thresholds using the two
methods on the various perturbed interaction networks.
We find that the performances of both methods are less
significantly affected by random additions than by random deletions. Interestingly, we also find that the prediction performance of FS-Weighted Averaging actually
improves with random additions, while the performance
of Neighbor Counting deteriorates with added noise.

However, with random deletions, the performance of FSWeighted Averaging deteriorates slightly faster than that
of Neighbor Counting. Nonetheless, FS-Weighted Averaging performs better than Neighbour Counting in all the
experiments. These observations indicate that FSWeighted Averaging is robust to false positives in the
interaction data but is less effective in sparser interaction
networks.

Identifying functions better predicted with indirect
neighbors
We want to identify functions that can be better predicted
with FS-Weighted Averaging. We compute the ROC scores
of predictions made by 1) Neighbor Counting (NC) and
2) FS-Weighted Averaging (WA) for each Level-4 GO term
annotated by at least 30 proteins. Due to limited annotation and interaction data, we study only 4 genomes: S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, H. sapiens, and M. musculus. Figure
7 shows a 2D plot of ROC scores of predictions made by

point on the graph represents a Level-4 GO term. A point
above the diagonal line indicates that WA yields a better
ROC score, while a point below the diagonal line indicates that NC yields a better ROC score.
For all the four genomes in Figure 4, most points on the
graph lie above the diagonal line, indicating that FSWeighted Averaging performed better than Neighbor
Counting for most of these GO terms.
To identify GO terms on which FS-Weighted Averaging
can achieve the best relative performance over Neighbor
Counting, we first select only level-4 GO terms that appear
in at least two of the four genomes. For each term, we
define a score that reflects the relative ROC score of FSWeighted Averaging against Neighbor Counting as follows:

score of the predictions made by Neighbor Counting.
We select the top five terms from each GO category based
on their average FL2 in the genomes in which they appear
and present them in Table 3.

Discussion
We have shown that FS-Weighted Averaging consistently
outperforms Neighbor Counting and Chi-Square in function prediction for the various genomes. By incorporating
interaction reliability, topological weight, and indirect
interactions, the method can predict more functions with
higher precision in all three categories of the Gene Ontology. It is also reasonably resilient against interaction
noise, maintaining consistent prediction performance
even when a large number of interactions are randomly
added to the interaction data. However, we have also seen
that the performance edge of FS-Weighted Averaging is

less significant in the genomes with sparse interaction networks and also less significant when the interaction network is made sparser by random deletions. This is due to
two factors. First, the number of indirect interactions is
much lower for sparser networks due to limited connectivity. Indirect interactions can only involve proteins that
interact with at least one other protein, i.e., the proteins in
the interaction network. Second, the performance of FSWeighted Averaging is dependent on the effectiveness of
the FS-Weight measure, which is limited when the network is sparse.
Limitations of FS-Weight
We have seen from Table 2 that FS-Weight remains effective even for the sparser networks. However, while FSWeight can still identify function-sharing interactions for
sparser networks, it will miss more interactions that do
share function. The topological weight is computed based
on the common interaction neighbors of the network.
When the interaction network is very sparse, there is often
insufficient information in the local topology for FSWeight to get a confident estimate on functional similarity
between proteins. In such cases, FS-Weight assigns a low
weight to the interaction. As such, it may limit the contribution of some function-sharing interactions to the function prediction mechanism in FS-Weighted Averaging.
Nonetheless, we can see this as a feature rather than a lim-

any form of measure that would assign a high reliability
score or high confidence in sharing function without
additional evidence would be very susceptible to noise
and will not give consistent performance over different
datasets.
Examples of indirect functional association
Here we take a look at two examples that illustrate how
indirect interactions can provide functional association
that cannot be captured through direct interactions.
Indirect functional association of biological process
Figure 8 shows the local interaction neighborhood of a
protein, YJR147W. To prevent clutter, level-2 neighbors
with FS-Weight < 0.05 are excluded. YJR147W has
unknown molecular function, and is involved in pseudohyphal growth. YJR147W interacts with only one protein,
YGR121C, which is an ammonium permease that participates in the regulation of pseudohyphal growth. Hence it
is not possible to assign YJR147W with the biological
process pseudohyphal growth from YGR121C. However, if
we look beyond direct interactions, we find that there are
several other proteins that participate in pseudohyphal
growth in the level-2 neighbors of YJR147W. These are
shown as green nodes in Figure 8.
Indirect functional association of molecular function
In the second example, we look at the local interaction
neighbourhood of another protein, YBR264C, which is

shown in Figure 9. YBR264C, shown as a red node in the
figure, is a GTP binding protein. As there are too many
level-2 neighbors, we only show those with FS-weight >=
0.05. While YBR264C interacts with nine proteins, none
of these shares its molecular function, GTPase activity. On
the other hand, a number of level-2 neighbors have this
function (shown as green nodes).
Interestingly, the level-2 neighbors and YBR264C form a
bipartite graph with four proteins: YGL198W, YNL263C,
YNL044W, and YER136W. YGL198W is a Ypt-interacting
protein that interacts with Rab GTPases. YNL263C and
YNL044W have no known molecular function but are
known to be involved in ER to Golgi transport.
YER136W is a GDP dissociation inhibitor that regulates
vesicle traffic in secretory pathways by regulating the dissociation of GDP from GTP binding proteins. Two of the
four proteins have molecular functions that require interaction with GTPases, while the other two have no known
molecular function. It is likely that YNL263C and
YNL044W, which have no known molecular function,
would have molecular functions that involve interaction
with GTPases.

integral membrane protein required for the biogenesis of
ER-derived COPII transport vesicles and has no known
molecular function. It is likely that YGR172C would share
the molecular function GTPase activity with YBR264C.
Novel predictions for S. cerevisiae
Using FS-Weighted Averaging, we predict GO functions
for uncharacterized proteins in the interaction network of
S. cerevisiae. From these predictions, we select predictions
with higher confidence by:

1. Excluding GO terms that are associated with fewer than
30 annotated proteins;
2. Excluding GO terms that have an ROC of less than 0.7
during cross validation;
3. For each remaining GO term, retaining only novel predictions that have a score greater than or equal to at least
70% of annotated proteins with the term.
4. Propagating predictions to include ancestor terms for
consistency.
These predictions are publicly available at [26]. We welcome collaborations with experimentalists interested in
verifying some of these predictions.

Conclusion
We also notice that YGR172C is the only member on its
side of the bipartite graph that does not have the molecu-

topological weighting and indirect neighbors, FSWeighted Averaging can predict protein function effectively for all three categories of the Gene Ontology. This
result is consistent across the seven genomes, indicating
that the approach is robust and likely to be generally
applicable. We have also studied the impact of noisy interaction data on the performance of FS-Weighted Averaging
and find that it is very robust against random perturbations in the interaction network. The study also reveals
that FS-Weighted Averaging displays greater effectiveness
for sufficiently dense interaction networks as its weighting
mechanism requires sufficient local network information.

Methods
Interaction and annotation datasets for multiple genomes
In this study, we will cover several genomes, namely Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly),
Caenorhabditis elegans (roundworm), Arabidopsis thaliana
(mouse-ear cress), Rattus norvegicus (Norway rat), Mus
musculus (house mouse), and Homo sapiens (human). Protein-protein interactions for D. melanogaster, C. elegans,
and S. cerevisiae are obtained from the latest release
(2.0.20) of BioGRID (formerly GRID [19]). Interaction
data for A. thaliana, R. norvegicus, M. musculus, and H. sapiens are obtained from the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND) [27]. Predicted protein-protein
interactions for S. cerevisiae are obtained from the Search
Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins
(STRING) database [23].

As genome-specific function annotation schemes may
have inherent biases, we use a unified annotation scheme,
the Gene Ontology [20], for function annotations. Gene
Ontology (GO) terms are arranged in a hierarchical manner with more general terms at the lower level and more
specific terms at the higher level. In this study, we define
the GO term "biological process" as level 0, its children
terms as level 1, and so on. Annotations follow the true
path rule – a protein annotated with a GO term is also
annotated with all its ancestor terms.
Table 1 shows some statistics of the various interaction
datasets. We consider only annotated proteins in our
study since our interest is in function inference. As the
lower levels in the GO hierarchy can be very general, we
refer to a protein as "annotated" if it is being annotated
with at least one level-4 GO term. The first column depicts
the number of interactions between annotated proteins.
The second column shows the number of proteins that are
annotated and have at least one interaction partner. The
third column shows the average number of annotated
neighbors per (annotated) protein. We use this as a simple
indicator of the density of the interaction network. The S.
cerevisiae dataset has the densest interaction network followed by D. melanogaster and H. Sapiens datasets. The R.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/S4/S8

norvegicus and C. elegans datasets have sparser interaction
networks, with less than one annotated neighbor per
annotated protein on the average.
Direct and indirect interactions
We define a direct interaction as an actual interaction
between proteins in the protein-protein interaction data.
In Figure 1, nodes in the graph represent proteins while
edges between the nodes represent protein-protein interactions. There is a direct interaction between proteins A
and B. We define an indirect interaction as the sharing of
common interaction partners between two proteins (i.e.,
the two proteins are level-2 neighbors). Figure 1 shows an
indirect interaction between proteins A and C. A pair of
proteins may have both direct and indirect interactions, as
illustrated by proteins A and D in Figure 1. Level-2 neighbors are able to bind to similar proteins; thus they have a
higher likelihood of having similar molecular functions.
Since subcellular localization shows substantial correlation with molecular function [28], level-2 neighbors are
also likely to reside in similar cellular components.
Topological weighting
Not all indirect interactions indicate function sharing.
Indirect relationships are defined upon direct ones and
are subjected to noise in the interaction network. Also,
while two proteins can interact with a common protein,
they may not bind to the common protein at the same
site. To identify which indirect interactions are more likely
to share functions, we proposed a topological weighting
scheme, FS-Weight [18].

The FS-Weight of the direct or indirect interaction
between two proteins u and v is defined as:
SR ( u, v ) =
2

∑

w∈( N ( u )∩ N ( v ) )

ru,w rv ,w

⎛
⎞
⎜
ru,w rv ,w + λu,v

∑
⎜ ∑ u,w

⎜ ∑ v ,w
⎟
⎜ w∈N ( v )
⎟
w∈( N ( u )∩ N ( v ) )
w∈( N ( u )∩ N ( v ) )
⎠
⎝

N(p) refers to the set that contains protein p and its level1 neighbors;

λu,v is a pseudo-count included in the computation to
penalize similarity weights between protein pairs when
any of the proteins has very few level-1 neighbors.
ru,w refers to the estimated reliability of the interaction
between u and w:

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8(Suppl 4):S8

ru,v = 1 −

∏ (1 − ri )

ni ,u ,v

i∈Eu ,v

ri is the estimated reliability of experimental source i;
Eu,v is the set of experimental sources in which interaction
between u and v is observed; and
ni,u,v is the number of times that interaction between u and
v is observed from experimental source i.
FS-Weight addresses the abovementioned problems in
two ways. First, the interaction network is weighted using
estimated reliability values to reduce the impact of noise.
Second, the weight is largely determined by the number of
common interaction partners between the two proteins: if
the two proteins share many common neighbors, the likelihood of sharing common physical characteristics
increases. The number of non-common neighbors is used
as a penalizing factor: if any of the two proteins also bind
to many other proteins, then the likelihood of sharing
common physical characteristics decreases.
Reliability of experimental sources
To reduce the impact of noise in the interaction network,
the reliability of each experimental source of protein interaction data (e.g., two-hybrid, synthetic lethality) is
assessed and weighted. Each source may be assigned an
estimated reliability weight by experts based on domain
knowledge. However, since we do not have domain
knowledge, a simple way to do this is to estimate based on
known functions as well as the agreement among independent experimental sources. Here we estimate the reliability of each experimental source by the fraction of
unique interactions detected by the experimental source
in which at least one level-4 Gene Ontology term is
shared. This is done using annotated proteins in the training data during cross validation. The reliability of interactions observed in many independent experimental
sources will be combined as described in the definition of
FS-Weight. We do not use indirect interactions for the estimation of reliability to avoid circular reasoning as the definition of indirect neighbors is dependent upon the
reliability.
Function prediction
The comparison of FS-Weighted Averaging with many
existing approaches has been done in [18] on the yeast
genome. Here we will study the performance of the
approach on various additional genomes using two classical methods, Neighbor Counting and Chi-Square, as a
benchmark:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/S4/S8

Neighbor Counting
The Neighbor Counting method is proposed in [10]. For
each protein u, each function x is ranked based on the frequency of its occurrence in the interaction partners (level1 neighbors) of u. The rank of each function is used as its
score for u:

⎛
⎞
fx ( u ) = rank ⎜ ∑ δ ( v, x ) ⎟
⎜ v∈N
⎟
u
⎝
⎠

δ(v, x) = 1 if v has function x, 0 otherwise;
rank(q(x)) refers to the rank of the function x relative to all
functions based on q(x).
Chi-Square
The Chi-Square method is proposed in [11]. The
approach scores each function f observed in the neighbors
of a protein u using the Chi-Square statistic. The statistic
measure computes the deviation of the observed occurrence of function f in the neighbors of u from its expected
occurrence. In [11], the function with the largest chisquare value is assigned to u. Since we want to assign multiple functions to each protein, we use the rank of each
function as its score instead:

⎛
⎜
⎜
⎜
fx ( u ) = rank ⎜
⎜
⎜
⎜
⎝

⎛
⎜ ∑ δ ( v, x ) − e x
⎜ v∈N
u
⎝
ex

⎞
⎟
⎟
⎠

2

⎞
⎟
⎟
⎟
⎟
⎟
⎟
⎟
⎠

ex is the expected number of proteins with function x
among the interaction partners of u, computed by multiplying the number of annotated interaction partners of u
with the frequency of function x among annotated proteins in the interaction map
FS-Weighted Averaging
Neighbor Counting uses occurrence-based ranking as a
score for functions. A score derived for one protein may
not reflect similar confidence as the same score derived for
another. In [18], we introduced FS-Weighted Averaging,
which uses a normalized weighted voting approach. The
likelihood that a protein u has a function x is estimated
by:
fx ( u ) =

⎡
⎛
⎞⎤
1⎢
∑ ⎜ S ( u, v ) δ ( v, x ) + ∑ max ( SFS ( u, v ) SFS ( v, w ) , SFS ( u, w ) ) δ ( w, x ) ⎟ ⎥
⎢ v∈N ⎜ FS
⎟⎥
Z
w∈Nv
u⎝
⎠⎦
⎣

Z is the sum of all weights:

Page 11 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8(Suppl 4):S8

⎛
⎞
Z = 1 + ∑ ⎜ SFS ( u, v ) + ∑ max ( SFS ( u, v ) SFS ( v, w ) , SFS ( u, w ) ) ⎟
⎟
v∈Nu ⎜
w∈Nv
⎝
⎠

In the same equation from [18], we added the background
frequency of function x to the summation of weights in
fx(u). When the weights of all the interactions in the local
neighbourhood of a protein are very low, the background
frequency gives an estimate of the score. This is done so
that all proteins can be given a prediction. However, as
many of the genomes in this study are very sparse, derived
interaction weights are very low. As a result, the background frequency will be given excessive weight, which
negatively affects predictions results. Hence we exclude
the background frequency from FS-Weighted Averaging in
this work.
Prediction performance evaluation
To evaluate the performance of each approach, we use two
popular validation methods, precision-recall analysis and
receiver operating characteristics, both of which are
described below.
Precision-recall analysis
The first method is to plot the precision against recall for
the predictions made. Precision-recall analysis indicates
the overall prediction performance of a prediction
method. It also reflects the ability of a method to assign
scores to predictions across different GO terms since it
does not differentiate between scores assigned for different terms.

∑ i ki
K
∑ i mi

∑ i ki
K
∑ i ni

score is computed for the predictions for each informative
GO term and measures how well the term is predicted for
proteins. A higher ROC score indicates a better classifier,
and the perfect classifier has an ROC score of 1. For any
given GO term, if no prediction is made for a protein, we
assume that the lowest possible score is assigned. The
ROC does not reflect the recall of a method and does not
differentiate between a method with very low recall and a
method with high recall but low precision. Hence the two
validation methods are complementary.
Since statistical measures are used for the validation of
predictions, we only consider terms that are annotated to
a reasonably large number of proteins to ensure that conclusions drawn from these measures are statistically
sound. We adopt the approach of informative functional
classes used in [9] and [18]. For each of the 3 GO categories – biological process, molecular function, and cellular
component – we define an informative GO term as a term
which is annotated to at least n proteins and does not have
any child term that is annotated to at least n proteins. n =
30 is used for the S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, M. musculus, and H. sapiens genomes. For the remaining genomes,
n = 10 is used instead as there are few or no informative
terms for validation when n = 30 is used.

Receiver operating characteristics
While precision-recall analysis summarizes the overall
prediction performance of a prediction method, it does
not tell us about the prediction performance for each
term. Since it does not differentiate between predictions
made for different terms, it also penalizes methods that
do not assign scores that reflect prediction confidence uniformly across different terms. Hence we choose to complement precision-recall analysis with another validation
method. The Receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
[22] score is the area under the curve derived from plotting true positives as a function of false positives. The ROC
