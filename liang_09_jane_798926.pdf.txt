Abstract
Background: ESTs or variable sequence reads can be available in prokaryotic studies well before
a complete genome is known. Use cases include (i) transcriptome studies or (ii) single cell
sequencing of bacteria. Without suitable software their further analysis and mapping would have to
await finalization of the corresponding genome.
Results: The tool JANE rapidly maps ESTs or variable sequence reads in prokaryotic sequencing
and transcriptome efforts to related template genomes. It provides an easy-to-use graphics
interface for information retrieval and a toolkit for EST or nucleotide sequence function prediction.
Furthermore, we developed for rapid mapping an enhanced sequence alignment algorithm which
reassembles and evaluates high scoring pairs provided from the BLAST algorithm. Rapid assembly
on and replacement of the template genome by sequence reads or mapped ESTs is achieved. This
is illustrated (i) by data from Staphylococci as well as from a Blattabacteria sequencing effort, (ii)
mapping single cell sequencing reads is shown for poribacteria to sister phylum representative
Rhodopirellula Baltica SH1. The algorithm has been implemented in a web-server accessible at http:/
/jane.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de.
Conclusion: Rapid prokaryotic EST mapping or mapping of sequence reads is achieved applying
JANE even without knowing the cognate genome sequence.

Background
Problem
In eukaryotes, mapping of eukaryotic ESTs (expressed
sequence tags) to DNA has to deal with splicing, widely
distributed parts of genome sequence have to be aligned
and the genome sequence is generally known. In contrast,

JANE deals with the opposite problem: Prokaryotic ESTs
or variable sequence reads are mapped, assigned and analyzed in a sequencing project well before the prokaryotic
genome sequence is completely known. In particular
rapid EST sequencing (e.g. this study and [1]), ecological
community sequencing [2,3] and single cell sequencing

[4,5] provide large data sets in prokaryotes though the
genome sequence is not or only very partially known. For
these use cases JANE (Just Analyze Nucleotides and ESTs)
allows (i) to rapidly identify the function of ESTs as well
as short sequence reads, (ii) to map ESTs and variable
reads (multiple fasta-format files) to an already known
related prokaryotic genome and (iii) to reconstruct a "virtual genome" of the unknown or incomplete prokaryotic
genome already before assembly of a new prokaryotic
genome including prediction of badly sampled regions.
(iv) As prokaryotic cDNAs reflect multigene transcription
units, JANE's rapid EST mapping can be used for operon
mapping. (v) ESTs from clinical isolates (e.g. different S.
aureus strains) can be rapidly mapped to related known
genomes. (vi) Mapped reads are statistically analyzed, e.g.
to show highly transcribed regions in the genome or
undersampling as well as repeat regions. (vii) Any other
type of short sequences can be mapped to the chosen template genome. In particular, this speeds up genome predictions in single cell sequencing efforts and from
ultrafast transcriptome sequencing efforts, e.g. pyrosequencing reads from sequencing of cDNA libraries.
Data sets and use cases for JANE are: Use-case (i) transcriptome data (ESTs, mRNA, cDNA) to map to a genome template not identical to the transcriptome that is investigated
as the genome template is not known. Use-case (ii) single
cell sequencing data and the use case is here to predict or
establish a more complete genome sequence. In contrast,
for ultrafast sequencing recent developments include
ultrafast DNA sequencing assembly programs such as
Maq [6], SOAP [7], SeqMap [8] and Bowtie [9] and RMAP
[10] which are optimal to map short and very short reads
to their cognate genome. This is the ultrafast sequencing
use-case (iii) with read lengths from 36-400 bp which are
then assembled or mapped to their cognate DNA template. JANE is compared also to this software.
Applications
We show JANE's good performance in JANE's standard
use cases (i, ii), that is in particular for assembling variable
sequence reads (from few basepairs to kilobases) in mapping to a related, non-identical template genome in the
tasks mentioned above as described in detail in [1-5].
Here mapping should be efficiently done without knowing the exact DNA sequence. However, then it is difficult
to accurately map the variable (short, long) sequence
reads as there are no perfect matches and if standard
sequence comparison algorithms are used, the search may
not find any matches or mapping location and range of
EST is frequently ambiguous. This problem is solved in
JANE by a specific assembly algorithm for HSPs and start
alignments. Moreover, the function of the EST or mapped
region should be predicted. Furthermore, the template
genome used for the mapping should be stepwise

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/391

replaced by the contigs achieved after mapping a sufficient
number of ESTs or short sequence reads and an overview
on the not assigned sequences obtained. We developed
for these problems JANE as a user-friendly application. It
includes a new implemented harvesting program for
extension and assembly of HSPs. HSPs are high scoring
pairs of two sequence fragments of arbitrary but equal
length whose alignment is locally maximal and for which
the alignment score meets or exceeds a threshold or cutoff
score. The HSPs were collected before by a parameter
adapted BLAST. Our focus is in the following on application aspects of the JANE software in its standard use cases,
we do not give an in depth treatment of sequence alignment methods, for this the reader is instead referred to
recent reviews on the topic such as [11].
Besides mapping prokaryotic ESTs, JANE is useful for
instance in the following scenarios: Mapping in an ongoing genome sequencing effort where no genome sequence
is available yet a number of ESTs is already there (the Blattabacteria project shown in the following is such an example from own work), analysis and mapping of ESTs from
clinical isolates where no genome sequence is available
(e.g. clinical Staphylococci isolates) as well as rapid mapping in transcriptomics studies without a matching
genome sequencing effort (for instance regarding different Blochmannia strains [12]). Furthermore, in single cell
sequencing efforts (a new technology to look at bacteria
non-cultivable in environmental samples) the situation
occurs quite often that incomplete reads are only available, the genome sequence is not known and mapping to a
template genome is useful or required [5].

Implementation
The program has been written in Perl using bioperl and
GD graphics libraries, the visualization interface was
implemented with Javascripts. JANE is currently running
on an Apache server, with a PostgreSQL http://www.post
gresql.org/ database support.
Algorithm
In JANE, a specific algorithm assembles HSPs (alignment
and assembly of high scoring pairs of similarity regions
between a sequence query and a similar database entry)
such that EST mapping to a template genome is optimized. The JANE algorithm does this task differently and
better than BLAST [13-15] (see results below). For the step
before, the HSP generation, the BLAST program package
was applied and the HSP generation parameters optimized. The combination allows mapping of ESTs and variable sequence reads even to distant template genomes.
Initial HSP extraction
Here the BLAST package (version 2.2.15) was applied and
parameters for lower-restriction searches applied (Fig. 1).

Strategy1 JANE
Strategy of JANE. 1) HSP regions (high scoring pairs) are collected applying the BLAST algorithm. Parameters were optimized to detect alignments with lower sequence similarity. 2) HSP fragments are processed using JANE's algorithm, a quality filter is applied to increase accuracy. 3) Top scoring HSPs for each reads are used as anchors. Next, further HSPs are selectively
considered (only the closest first) if not too distant (criterion: remaining length of the EST/sequence read to be mapped). 4)
The algorithm assembles and calculates potential coverage. Two reads sharing overlapping regions are consecutively merged,
forming a contig. 5) A predicted genome is generated replacing more and more parts from the template genome by mapped
and assembled sequences. 6) Modules in the JANE toolkit predict function information on individual ESTs or sequence reads.

Parameters included a lower penalty (-1) for a nucleotide
mismatch compared to the default value (-3), an E-value
of 0.1 for harvested ESTs by BLAST and the low-complexity filter is disabled. This reduces the accuracy but significantly enhances the harvest sensitivity. Moreover, this
allows longer extension both in 3' and 5' direction of the
EST paired region. It is critical for aligning EST to a relatively distant genome template, e.g., Blattabacteria to Candidatus Sulcia muelleri GWSS [GenBank: CP000770]. In
this example, a search applying BLAST and its standard
parameters can only locate about a seventh of the hits, not
sufficient for an efficient mapping. Furthermore, we
found that for best results in EST mapping (maximum
number of correct mapped ESTs) the low-complexity filter
(DUST) should be disabled, since filtering for low-complexity regions strongly reduces the available HSPs that
are subsequently evaluated. This disadvantage far outweighs the advantageous reduction in compositional
biased sequences by the filter.
Pairwise alignment and assembly algorithm
Here BLAST was no longer used, instead a new program
was written for a maximum use of revealed sequence colinearity. The top HSPs of each read according to their
scores are sorted and used as start alignments in the following step. Only the top scoring HSP in a database entry
provides a start alignment for anchoring the alignment.
Nearby each start alignment, the remaining unmatched
regions are in general located either in the UTRs or in less
well conserved regions. The start alignment provides a
strong signal. Its position and in the considered read or
EST suggests a potential coverage region in the corresponding genome. Based on this, further HSPs of lower
score are considered if they are still in the remaining EST
or sequence read region (distance criterion). These secondary HSPs still carry useful information for the direction of further alignments and improve the coverage in
the final mapping. Moreover, the utilization of these secondary HSPs contributes to overcome the obstacles
derived from length variation of non-translated regions
and their less well conservation and it improves mapping
of distantly related sequence reads to a template. For optimal results, the alignment penalty in these secondary
alignment regions is set to zero both for gap creation and
extension.

The assembly of anchoring and secondary HSPs results in
a series of local co-linear islands. Next the program assembles the islands if any two in the template are overlapping
and such steps are repeated in both directions, forming a
contig region. If JANE is used in a large-scale sequencing
project allowing high coverage of different genome
regions, the regions of the template genome which are
never hit by sequence reads are with high probability
insertions in the template genome respective to the new

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/391

sequenced genome (this can be directly checked by the
user applying JANE). However, this shows also that the
requirements for the template genome are easy to fulfill:
A moderate overall sequence similarity (over 60% amino
acid identity in household enzymes, see below) to the
organism the ESTs are derived from and a triple coverage
of the template genome with typical Sanger or 454
sequencing reads (400 bp reads) are sufficient.
Filter for higher alignment accuracy
JANE considers next many secondary HSPs after a major
HSP for anchoring the alignment has been identified. For
higher specificity, a filter in JANE's algorithm discards all
HSPs of extremely-low identity (<20%). From the HSPs
harvested, only the HSP with the top score for each read is
considered and used as anchor for the first alignment iteration. Further HSPs are subsequently considered. Only
the closest one is connected with the anchor region when
the distance from the anchor is not too far (distance cutoff
criterion: distance less or equal to the remaining length of
the EST which is considered). The assembly is iterated and
always carried out from the anchor region to the closest
HSP candidate from the complete harvested HSPs. Not
joined HSPs are filtered out during the procedure.
Change of parameters and program modules
JANE's web-interface allows users to specify the following
parameters: E-Value, minimum HSP length (default setting: 70) for HSP harvests as well as a zoom factor for optimal visualization. Within the program, a standaloneBlast
routine is used exclusively to generate HSPs. In this task it
enables many parameters (more then 20 different parameters; set as default for later processing by JANE according
to the default setting used in Blast) to be modified by an
interested programmer. Next, JANE's HSP harvesting program is implemented. It is integrated with and assembles
the bioperl StandaloneBlast generated HSPs. All specific
parameters of JANE including top HSPs considered, filtering criteria, alignment parameters can be freely varied in
its code. For instance, one can use different filter criteria or
modify the distance cutoff for HSPs to be considered in an
EST mapping task. This can be interesting for further
applications or modified sequence similarity searches or
comparisons. Note however, that all parameters have
been optimized in their default setting by us for the
intended prokaryotic sequence read mapping task to a not
perfect template genome.
Strategy
JANE's strategy is an elective HSP assembly strategy (Fig.
1). As a comparison example, DIALIGN and its successor
DIALGN-TX [16,17] enable improved multiple sequence
alignments with a remarkable higher speed in comparison
to the popular global alignment application CLUSTALX.
DIALIGN uses a greedy strategy for multiple alignment, all

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:391

possible pairs of input sequences are taken. DIALIGN-TX
uses instead a guide tree based on pairwise similarity
scores, and considers as DIALIGN-T not only the weight
scores of individual fragments (overlap weights) but also
the overall degree of similarity between the two sequences
involved in the fragment. A fragment is here a pair of two
equal lengths segments from two different input
sequences, a local pairwise gap-free alignment of these
two sequences. The strategy of JANE is different: Instead of
multiple-alignments, JANE implements an algorithm to
have multiple fragments assembled and mapped to one
reference template. Furthermore, JANE considers for each
sequence read to be mapped only the top HSP as anchor
and then the closest neighbour HSP if it is still within EST/
sequence read length. Iteratively further HSPs are
anchored in this way. By this strategy the program can
cope with high sequence diversity and diverse read
lengths (from bp to kb) and can deal with not close
related template genomes in mapping. In comparison to
BLAST [14] the HSP assembly strategy is also improved
regarding the specific task of mapping to a non-identical
template. In particular, JANE starts only with the top scoring HSP in any alignment for anchoring and secondary
HSPs are only assembled if they are the closest neighbour
and within the length of the individual sequence read to
be mapped. In summary, JANE accepts large sequence
diversity and read length (from bp to kb) and thus can
efficiently map variable reads from different sequencing
approaches to similar and dissimilar genome templates.
Its mapping strategy is particularly advantageous in transcriptome sequencing and single cell sequencing efforts
when the complete genome sequence is not available.
Mapping visualization and virtual genome
A user-friendly interface facilitates to retrieve mapping
information and alignment figures. Moreover, a tabdelimited alignment profile can be downloaded from the
results page for further analysis using third-party software,
e.g., GNU R. In growing contig-regions the template
genome is step by step replaced by mapped ESTs or short
sequence reads and the new genome thus takes over. Capital letters record assembled reads whereas lowercase letters denote the used template genome. The resulting file
can be downloaded for further analysis.
Function analysis
JANE provides a toolkit for rapid function assignment [see
additional file 1: Fig. S1]. Novel sequences can be
searched against a database derived from the COG/KOG
collection [18], the program "COGmaster" will generate a
table listing the putative COG classification and description. In contrast to cognitor [18], our module enables
batch-searches both for long nucleotide and protein
sequences. This helps to rapidly obtain a raw annotation,
e.g., for a genomic fragment.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/391

Further applications contained in the JANE package
A "Format converter" assists in fast sequence format conversion (12 formats) in particular when READSEQ [19]
lacks the corresponding conversion capability for richsequence features such as complex location features. Specific programs allow to rapidly extract all reading frames
from a given neighbouring genome (routine "Proteome
extractor") or to translate a given EST or sequence read in
all six reading frames (using the routine "6 frame translator"). The "Proteome extractor" extracts and assembles
protein reading frames from GenBank and other primary
databank records of a complete genome sequence. The
routine uses the tag of "translation" and extracts directly
all the protein sequences tagged like this from the genome
data file (the complete predicted proteome). Moreover,
we provide a solution to extract the coding proteins from
unpublished sequence files; "6 frame translator" enables
to select the sequence regions and translates these in all six
reading frames.

To check in sequences with a function still unclear for
encoded proteins the user can directly search with the
nucleotide sequence in the COG database (program
"COG master") as well as for different motifs (program
"Pattern searcher"). "Pattern searcher" is complementary
for sequence alignment and specialized for rapid pattern
matching on protein and nucleotide sequences, in order
to reveal functions by protein motifs and nucleotide elements. Prosite [20] motif-syntax and general regularexpressions are both supported. Bioperl modules [21] and
translation by the "virtual ribosome" program [22] are
used in parallel to predict and obtain proteins from EST
cDNA data or variable sequence reads.

Results and Discussion
For rapid EST or variable sequence read mapping, users
upload a related genome template and the sequence
reads/ESTs to be mapped. The rapid heuristic alignment
algorithm in JANE compares sequences including interactive visualization in a genome browser. With the incorporated toolkit annotation information is readily obtained
and the sequence can be eventually exported as part of the
predicted new genome for further analysis (e.g. metabolism and other functions).
Use case (i), mapping of ESTs
Figure 2 illustrates how ESTs are mapped to common
genome regions using a phylogenetically related genome
template. In the example, ESTs from Blattabacterium spp.
(symbiont from the cockroach Blattella germanica) are
mapped by JANE using the related template genome of
Candidatus Sulcia muelleri GWSS (previously sequenced,
[23]). Evidently, sparse EST information is efficiently
mapped and allows already with minimal information a
first look at the arrangement of mapped ESTs/predicted

Mapping2of Blattabacteria short ESTs onto a moderate related genome template
Figure
Mapping of Blattabacteria short ESTs onto a moderate related genome template. In the example, JANE maps a
high fraction of ESTs to moderately related genomes (at least 80% rRNA identity/60% household enzyme similarity) with about
80% accuracy. The number in the left scale indicates the location in the genome template (in kilobases). All mapped ESTs are
listed. Arrows in different colours (right) mark the consensus regions of mapping, i.e., red indicates the forward strand and
green the reverse strand. A statistical report analyzes the mapping result (right corner). The inserts at the bottom show that
by clicking on an individual EST detailed analysis is possible, the different HSPs used and their position appear. This includes also
a list of all HSPs available as well as the chosen best EST match generated by JANE. Further analysis regarding all ESTs of that
region, contig prediction, coding sequence and function prediction is also provided (see text). More details on the program
options and an actual screen shot are given in Fig. S1.

transcription units. JANE starts with the template genome,
and maps then ESTs from a new organism. Counters indicate which short reads or ESTs are not yet assigned, how
many ESTs are currently assigned ("Hits") and how many
short reads have too low score to be assigned ("Not
assigned").
The template genome is step by step replaced by aligned
short reads. Genome structure and genome features can
be assessed already long before the sequencing effort of
the genome is completed (predicted "virtual Blattabacteria
genome"). In this EST mapping task using an only moderate (see below) related genome template (Fig. 2), the algorithm nevertheless allows to assign about 50% of all ESTs
when thresholds of 10-3 (E-value) and 100 bp (minimum
length of HSP) are applied. Thus in the example given, an
assignment applying BLAST with optimal settings (see
above) for this task detects only 44 significant hits.
Instead, applying JANE's heuristic algorithm, 154 ESTs
from a total of 310 ESTs are successfully located.
We examined the mapping accuracy using a "fingerprint"
test of COG hits. For each EST, a COG number match
between the EST and the correct COG using the correct
genome region is counted 1 point, each mismatch (wrong
COG or KOG assigned) gets zero points. In the example,
this returns for the Blattabacterium EST mapping using
Candidatus Sulcia muelleri GWSS as template 80.0% accuracy of the mapped hits. Additional file 1 with its Fig. S2
illustrates EST mapping of genes for purine metabolism,
applying a more distant genome template (Gramella forsetii). The annotation was verified as correct by subsequent sequencing.
We furthermore tested mapping of ESTs from different
sources on various template genomes such as Candidatus
sulcia muelleri [GenBank: CP000770], Gramella forsetii
[GenBank: CU207366], Staphylococcus aureus N315, COL
[GenBank: BA000018, CP000046] and Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228 [GenBank: AE015929]. For best
results, the closest related genome available should in
general be used as template. For detailed comparisons of
potential template genomes we established a dedicated
tool (InGeno [24]). However, a distance as far as Gramella
forsetii or Candidatus Sulcia to Blattabacteria is sufficient as
a solid basis for genome reconstruction with JANE. This
corresponds to just more than 80% identity in the
16sRNA or more than 60% sequence identity in household enzyme protein sequences. Certainly this does not
remove reconstruction problems which may arise from
complex genome rearrangements or extended and short
repetitive sequences in the new genome. However, fast
mapping of a high fraction of the variable reads outside of
such regions is nevertheless easily possible with JANE.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/391

Similar use case (i): rapid mapping of multiple sequencing
reads
Moreover, numerous sequence reads from pyrosequencing or other methods are rapidly mapped by JANE. An
illustration example concerns Staphylococcus aureus
JKD6008 (unfinished whole shotgun sequences) [GenBank: ABRZ01000001-ABRZ01000128]. This is a lowlevel vancomycin-resistant and persistent methicilinresistent S. aureus isolate [25]. 128 JKD6008 contigs from
GenBank were acquired and mapped on the nucleotide
sequence of Staphylococcus aureus N315 genome (Fig. 3).
Mapping quality according to COG fingerprinting (see
above) is 92.10% and 125 contigs from the total of 128
can be mapped. We illustrate [see Additional file 1: Fig.
S3] that using S. aureus N315 strain as template works
equally well (correlation of correctly assigned COGs).
JANE is able to deal with and assemble fairly short
sequencing reads (20-40 nucleotides, e.g. SOLID, short
ILLUMINA reads [26]) but shows for longer sequences
(paired end ILLUMINA reads, 454 sequencing) best performance also compared to alternatives (see below).
Comparison to Blast
Results for comparison of our EST mapping with a golden
standard heuristic for sequence alignment, BLAST [14],
are good. In particular, sensitivity of EST matches is
improved significantly, allowing mapping even to distant
template genomes. Nevertheless, specificity remains high
in JANE, i.e. correct matching of ESTs to the template
genome as examined for different template genomes.
These results rely on the specific algorithm incorporated
in JANE to optimally select and harvest HSPs, and are
independent from an optimal parameter choice of the
BLAST algorithm (which in our comparisons is of course
already set with optimal parameters for generating potential HSPs in the EST mapping task).
Comparison to EST alignment programs
We can furthermore compare the alignment results
achieved to popular EST alignment programs. The software EST2Genome applies a Smith-Waterman algorithm
in the first local-alignment pass to improve the sensitivity
[27,28]. The quality of its alignment is similar to JANE's
prediction if the template genome is the same genome
from which the ESTs were derived. For more distant
genome templates, ESTs are lost from mapping
EST2Genome in the same way as in the above comparison
to BLAST. Moreover, our program has considerable higher
speed (in the example 8.7 seconds versus 1352 minutes).
Exonerate [29], a successor to Genewise [30] has a similar
speed as the JANE software when performing an
ungapped alignment. Its est2genome alignment-model
which considers gaps is relatively time-consuming and
has advantages of accuracy for eukaryotic EST alignment.
However, in mapping of distantly-related prokaryotic

Mapping of S. aureus JKD6008 contigs on S. aureus N315 genome. Using a related template genome, rapid mapping of
sequence reads, or of pre-assembled contigs is smoothly achieved. As in Fig. 2, the number in the left scale indicates the location in the genome template (in kilobases), arrows in different colours mark the consensus regions of mapping, i.e., red indicates the forward strand and green reverse. All mapped sequences are listed. Together, after mapping, they represent the

sequences, JANE prevails on both the number of located
ESTs (see above) and the computation speed.
EST2Genome and Exonerate are outstanding programs
optimized for eukaryotic EST mapping, whereas JANE
plays a critical role for rapid obtaining a mapping in particular for moderate-related prokaryotic sequences.

Comparison to short sequence read assembly programs for
ultrafast DNA sequencing
A recent focus of interest is ultrafast sequencing. Algorithms developed for this have the typical use case to align
short reads. In the following we compare JANE to these as
well as ultrafast sequencing algorithms for long reads as
here much development is going on. Detailed results
show reasonable performance for JANE but stress that this
is not the optimal use case for JANE as it excels if reads

have to be mapped to a non cognate genome. Thus two
new developments, SOAP [7] and RMAP [10] appeared in
2008 as command-line tools just after the algorithm for
JANE was finished. Both of them are designed to efficiently handle genome mapping of high-throughput short
reads. The SeqMap tool arose recently, the command-line
driven program offers various command-line options to
give the highest number of mapped reads when dealing
with short reads [8]. However, none of this alternative
software has an interactive graphical interface allowing
close up and distant views or separate views on start alignments and full alignments as JANE does. Table 1 compares the performance on contig mapping of
Staphylococci (top), EST mapping of Blattabacteria (middle) as well as mapping very short reads to the cognate
template genome (bottom). The short reads (bottom) are
chopped ESTs, as these are not so often used, Table 2 and
Table 3 deal with more typical data (Solexa reads, 454
reads) to test the ultrafast-sequencing software. The experiments were conducted in a computer with 4 GB RAM and
an intel E6300 CPU running an Ubuntu 8.10 linux sys-

tem. Local sequence files previously located in the JANE
server were applied to avoid biased comparison by the
effect of file-uploading time. RMAP is fastest among these
programs, whereas SeqMap appears comparatively slow.
The running time of JANE is relatively longer in comparison with other applications, however, this includes additional time for JANE's figure rendering procedure.
Regarding longer sequences (Table 1 top), JANE is able to
locate the highest number of reads (125 hits from a total
of 128, i.e., 97.7%). SOAP is specialized for short
sequence reads (20-40 nucleotides with read-length limits) and has large memory requirements but is very efficient (100%) and fast for short sequence mapping (Table
1 bottom). Another ultra-fast sequencing software is Maq
[6], developed in 2007, which is particularly designed for

* The total number of reads is 1000, we eliminated the incomplete or ambiguous reads in order to ensure all the programs run smoothly across the
benchmark test. Both templates are Homo sapiens chromosome fragments within an acceptable length range for all the above applications (Solexa
reads of 36 bp).

short read requirements make it not suitable to map
longer reads or reads with variable lengths. For comparison, JANE prevails in dealing with complex situations or
longer reads (Table 1 top, second rows) as it has a specific
HSP harvesting and assembly algorithm. It is able to tolerate more substitutions, inversions, limited insertions and
deletions in comparison to the compared programs. This
grants JANE the capability to generate a virtual genome
also from large-scale EST analyses and study these with the
included function-prediction toolkit. We carried out a
benchmark test on variable ESTs as well, 310 Blattabacteria
ESTs were aligned to the Candidatus Sulcia muelleri GWSS
genome (Table 1, second row). The results are summarized in Table 1. For a fair comparison, we tuned the
parameter of maximum allowed mismatches for RMAP to
10 to increase its sensitivity. As a result it correctly maps
41.3% of the 310 ESTs. We enabled the maximum
allowed mismatch parameter (= 5 max) of SeqMap, however, in spite of this and its strong performance in the
direct mapping task (Table 1, bottom) it still can not
locate any ESTs in this more complex situation. In the
complex examples given, JANE is advantageously used to
obtain best mapping results.

Further detailed comparisons
In modern ultrafast sequencing use cases, the generated
and often short (20-40 bp, typical 36 bp in several ultrafast sequencing methods) or longer fragments (e.g. 40500 bp or even longer fragments in improved Solexa/
SOLID or current 454 sequencing efforts) are mapped to
the cognate template. A typical use case of mapping 36400 bp long sequence reads to the correct DNA template
(use case iii, ultrafast sequencing use case) is of course
well handled by Solexa-specific software for ultrafast
sequencing (Table 2). JANE's alignment is not originally
designed for this purpose. It is relatively greedy and consumes longer time when aligning high-throughput reads.
We applied sample files mapping Solexa reads on human
genome contigs as given in additional files 2, including
the sample files used for RMAP testing, which is to map
Solexa reads to a contig of homo sapien chromosome 12.
The first 1000 Solexa reads were uploaded to the server to
align them to the genome template. Interestingly, JANE is
able to locate more reads than RMAP or SeqMap does,
however, RMAP runs much faster than JANE for mapping
these Solexa reads. Both Bowtie and SOAP revealed 37
Solexa reads which were the same as found by JANE. In
addition, we aligned these reads to another contig of chromosome 21, JANE was able to locate more reads in comparison to all the other software in Table 2. All mapped
reads were re-examined to be highly significant matches
(e < 10-6).

1Example: pori bacteria sequence reads are mapped to the template
genome Rhodopirellula Baltica SH1. These are typical long reads (300
bp and more). 2Accuracy of mapping (fingerprint test) was determined
as given in materials and methods. 3Exonerate assumes a eukaryotic
genome with splicing. Splicing events are introduced by Exonerate if
the sequence stretch is short and then an intron (several thousand
base pairs) is assumed until the next local match. Thus, in the tough
case above, all ESTs mapped (462 from 462) were sliced by Exonerate
in several pieces and only short regions were aligned. If there were
longer stretches they were mapped to the same region as JANE, but
did have shorter length in the alignment.

A key advantage of JANE compared to ultrafast sequencing mapping algorithms is its capability to deal with complex use cases where fragments of variable length are
mapped to a non-identical reference either in EST mapping or in single cell sequencing as the genome sequence
is either not yet or never fully known. In order to acquire
a comprehensive benchmark, we used for one set of comparisons a set of 310 short sequences, all of them generated from the Blattabacteria genome with a fixed length
(40 bp; the size all programs can accept; some programs
require only short reads). These are clearly short sequence
reads and all the software returns an outcome of almost
100% hits during the alignment. The sequences are first
mapped to their own genome template (bottom row in

Table 1). In this task, RMAP [10] is the fastest, Maq [6],
SOAP [7] and Bowtie [9] are second, however, all the programs are able to complete the jobs within an acceptable
time. In addition, focusing only on the alignment procedure, bowtie runs most rapid among all applications we
compared. However it requires a particular index-building
procedure, this additional time requirement has to be
considered in addition (around 3-5 seconds depending
on the complexity of the data to be indexed).
Next we did a similar but slightly more complex mapping
test using now short EST sequences (trimmed to 40 base
pairs). We mapped these now onto a related genome,
Candidatus Sulcia muelleri GWSS (top row in table 1). Here
RMAP is the champion only regarding execution time but
SeqMap, Maq and SOAP mapped more ESTs in comparison to RMAP. JANE performed best on locating them during the test. Finally, mapping typical ESTs of variable
lengths to a related genome is not suitable for all algorithms. In this more challenging test (bold, middle row in
table 1), only RMAP and JANE are able to locate them and
return the mapping results. Similar to this we give data on
an experiment of mapping long contigs (italics, top row in
table 1). Here JANE successfully locates the highest
number of reads, followed by RMAP.
Use case (ii), single cell sequencing tasks
JANE is particularly advantageous if variable sequence
reads between few base pairs (>20) up to thousand base
pairs have to be mapped to a non-identical genome template. This occurs typically in single cell sequencing [5], an
upcoming method to obtain genome sequences from
individual, non cultivable bacteria [4]. An example from
our own work (Table 3) involves mapping of pori-bacteria
sequence reads, a new bacterial phylum resident in porifera. The closest available relative with a complete genome
sequence is Rhodopirellula Baltica SH1, already a phylum
away (so as demanding as e.g. mapping E. coli sequence
reads onto B. subtilis genome sequence). Table 3 summarizes mapping results of 462 pori-bacterium reads from a
single cell sequencing experiment mapped onto this template. The sequences are typical long reads (454 reads,
Sanger reads). We apply 100 bp as the minimum alignment width during the benchmark test to minimize false
hits and allow comparison across different programs.
RMAP and Maq execute relatively faster with fewer hits
located, however JANE reveals more successfully mapped
regions beyond the cutoff minimal alignment length. This
is understandable, since RMAP, Maq, SeqMap and SOAP
are designed for rapid alignment of short reads such as
Solexa reads, whereas the algorithm of JANE allows to
map a wide range of sequence read lengths (few base pairs
to kilo bases). Here Exonerate is not really comparable as
it is trained and used for eukaryotic genomes. Thus it takes
66 minutes to exhaustively search the genome and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/391

mapped regions are always disturbed by spurious predicted intron regions. For this prokaryotic single cell
sequencing use case, JANE performs best in the task and
maps 103 (22.3% out of all the fragments, evaluation by
fingerprint test as described above). This 22.3% apply for
the first mapping iteration. If the next single cell of a pori
bacterium is sequenced, the JANE-optimized template
genome (where then already parts of Rhodopirellula Baltica
have been replaced by the pori bacterium) may be used
and thus more and more sequence reads are successfully
mapped in later iterations, provided the poribacteria are
picked from the same strain.
Further comparisons
High throughput pyrosequencing is now able to provide
sequence reads of over 400 bp, further tests on JANE were
carried out on these long de novo sequences (454; Sanger
reads). For this case, Roche's Newbler assembly software
is in principle able to tackle the aligning and assembly
problem since it is particularly designed for the 454 system, however, it requires a commercial license so it could
not be used for our benchmark test. Another popular
application is the phred and phrap package [31], which
performs efficiently when assembling shotgun reads and
incorporates quality data. However it lacks the feature to
map the reads from 454 or Solexa techniques to a reference template such as RMAP, Maq and SeqMap do. Of
course, if quite compact (viral genome), you could treat
the genome as another very long read but this requires
excessive memory studying bacterial genomes and is not
practical (data not shown).

Phrap is designed as a de novo assembler which is not suitable for the orthology mapping or assembly with a backbone genome, thus we did not include this software in our
comparisons. However, there is a consecutive application
"consed", which allows aligning reads to a reference
sequence, but here again only the identical template is
used. The comparisons show short sequence alignment
software prevails in efficiency in particular when aligning
high throughput reads, e.g., more than 10,000 entries
which online software can not afford. Ultrafast sequencing and mapping to the cognate template is thus not the
optimal use case for JANE, however JANE's algorithm provides relatively higher sensitivity and locates the same
number of or more reads with an acceptable speed. In particular, JANE offers here a very simple standalone
approach for single cell sequencing including mapping to
more or less related genomes. Results can then later be
complemented by more sophisticated and demanding
approaches.

Comparison to related programs offering genome viewers
and function assignment
Concerning function assignments, CAMERA [32] offers a
comprehensive platform for ecology research and analysis, its fragment recruitment viewer illustrates the spread
of metagenomic sequence reads across species as an encyclopedia. It provides interesting views for comparative
metagenomic studies and related-functions are revealed.
Similarly, the MG-RAST server [33] offers a pipeline to
assist researchers to acquire a rapid functional assignment
for sequences of the metagenome by comparing both
translated protein and nucleotide databases. Similar and
related programs are the RAST server [34] and IMG/M
server [35]. However, in addition to this software, JANE is
able to deal with fragment assembly, both for short oligonucleotide sequences and longer reads and rapidly predicts the putative genome regions which guide the next
iteration of sequencing.

JANE provides a platform for achieving a rapid impression
of genome structure and gene functions. Cap3 provides an
extensive precise sequence assembly and correction procedure [36], but has no mapping option for ESTs. Combining JANE and Cap3 is possible and should boost
sequencing progress. Finally, there is the recent development "Circos", a powerful graphical figure generator for
genome comparisons and to render results as various
types of circles using different Perl scripts [37]. There is no
graphical user interface and the output is specifically
intended to be non-linear. Also this tool can be well combined with JANE in prokaryotic transcriptome projects.

Conclusion
JANE allows rapid mapping and assembly of ESTs and variable length sequence reads also on non-identical, closer
or more distantly related genome templates. It outperforms in this task alternative algorithms. Mapping is thus
independent from whether the genome sequence of the
prokaryote in question becomes available. This is important in single cell/de novo sequencing (complete genome
is not available including even non-cultivatable bacteria)
and RNA-based transcriptome studies (either before the
full genome sequence is available or without a genome
sequence, e.g. in clinical isolates). In addition, JANE
includes function prediction and quality control of
mapped ESTs/reads, is standalone, easy to setup and open
source including the source code (publicly available at the
website).
