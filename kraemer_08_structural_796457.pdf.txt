Abstract
Background: Among the EF-Hand calcium-binding proteins the subgroup of S100 proteins
constitute a large family with numerous and diverse functions in calcium-mediated signaling. The
evolutionary origin of this family is still uncertain and most studies have examined mammalian family
members.
Results: We have performed an extensive search in several teleost genomes to establish the s100
gene family in fish. We report that the teleost S100 repertoire comprises fourteen different
subfamilies which show remarkable similarity across six divergent teleost species. Individual species
feature distinctive subsets of thirteen to fourteen genes that result from local gene duplications and
gene losses. Eight of the fourteen S100 subfamilies are unique for teleosts, while six are shared with
mammalian species and three of those even with cartilaginous fish. Several S100 family members
are found in jawless fish already, but none of them are clear orthologs of cartilaginous or bony fish
s100 genes. All teleost s100 genes show the expected structural features and are subject to strong
negative selection. Many aspects of the genomic arrangement and location of mammalian s100
genes are retained in the teleost s100 gene family, including a completely conserved intron/exon
border between the two EF hands. Zebrafish s100 genes exhibit highly specific and characteristic
expression patterns, showing both redundancy and divergence in their cellular expression. In larval
tissue expression is often restricted to specific cell types like keratinocytes, hair cells, ionocytes
and olfactory receptor neurons as demonstrated by in situ hybridization.
Conclusion: The origin of the S100 family predates at least the segregation of jawed from jawless
fish and some extant family members predate the divergence of bony from cartilaginous fish.
Despite a complex pattern of gene gains and losses the total repertoire size is remarkably constant
between species. On the expression level the teleost S100 proteins can serve as precise markers
for several different cell types. At least some of their functions may be related to those of their
counterparts in mammals. Accordingly, our findings provide an excellent basis for future studies of
the functions and interaction partners of s100 genes and finally their role in diseases, using the
zebrafish as a model organism.

Background
In mammals the family of S100 calcium binding proteins
has been a target of intensive study for over 40 years, since
the first two family members were purified from bovine
brain. Until today at least 20 members were described in
humans and a growing number in several other mammalian species. They share an average identity of 40–60% on
the amino acid level, but key features are more highly conserved. The s100 genes code for small, cytoplasmic or
secreted proteins that exhibit a common structure consisting of two calcium-binding loops each flanked by two
alpha-helices [1]. The N-terminal domain is a low affinity
S100-specific domain, whereas the other one is a classical
EF-Hand. A variable hinge region connects both domains.
Structural examination revealed a hydrophobic region
being exposed upon calcium binding which is thought to
interact with hydrophobic regions of the target proteins.
The calcium-binding domains also exhibit affinity for
other divalent cations such as copper and zinc [2]. Some
family members possess dysfunctional calcium-binding
domains, but there is also evidence of calcium-independent interactions in this family (for review see [3-7]). For
human S100 family members more than 90 potential target proteins, both intra- and extracellular ones, have been
reported. Among the interacting partners are other calcium-binding proteins (several members of the annexin
family), enzymes (e.g. aldolase A/C), cytoskeletal components (actin, tubulin), cell cycle regulator genes (p53),
second messenger-synthesizing enzymes (adenylate and
guanylate cyclase) as well as kinases. Accordingly, S100
proteins take part in many cellular processes which may
be divided into five major groups: a) modulation of the
activity of some protein kinases b) modulation of other
enzymatic activities c) maintenance of cell shape and
motility d) modulation of signal transduction pathways
and e) regulation of calcium homoeostasis [8]. The active
forms of S100 proteins often consist of homo- or heterodimers and even tetramers [9] or higher aggregates
[10]. The expression pattern of the S100 family exhibits a
remarkable degree of cell and tissue-specificity, so that
many tissues and cell types have their unique protein
composition and expression level [11-13].
There is no evidence for S100 proteins in invertebrates,
however, the evolutionary origin of the family has not
been studied much [14,15]. By far most publications deal
with the mammalian family members, and in fact no systematic study has been performed in teleosts. With an
intent to infer properties of the family in the most recent
common ancestor of teleosts and tetrapods we have characterized the S100 family both in shark and lamprey, and
in teleosts. We identified in each teleost species thirteen to
fourteen s100 genes, which are under strong negative
selection. Several of these genes appear to be considerably
more ancient than the teleost speciation events taken into

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/48

account here. Several mammalian s100 genes were found
to have counterparts in teleosts, but eight novel genes
restricted to teleosts were also detected. Furthermore we
have investigated the expression of ten Danio rerio s100
genes by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization and report
highly distinctive and specialized expression patterns,
suggestive of similarly specialized functions of the different family members.

Results
The repertoire size of the S100 family of thirteen to
fourteen genes is remarkably conserved across six
divergent teleost species
The S100 proteins constitute a small family of calciumbinding proteins with highly specific expression patterns
in mammals. So far the evolution of this family has not
been studied in teleosts. Up to date only two s100 genes
were reported in fish: a homologue of the mammalian
S100A was found in loach and trout [16,17] and a new
family member, ictacalcin, is present in several fish species
(catfish, pufferfish, loach, trout and zebrafish), but absent
in mammals [18-20]. These observations are consistent
with the notion that the S100 family may be already well
established in teleost fish, but may also diverge considerably from the mammalian repertoire. We therefore performed extended searches in the genomes of five different
teleost species to establish the complete S100 repertoire in
fish.

A recursive search strategy in the NCBI and Ensembl databases using the complete repertoire of human s100 genes
as reference set, in combination with retrieval of automated ortholog predictions (see Methods) uncovered a
total of 97 fish s100 genes. Fourteen s100 genes each were
identified for zebrafish and Takifugu rubripes, and thirteen
genes each for three-spined stickleback, medaka, and
Tetraodon nigroviridis. In addition, fourteen s100 genes
were found in EST libraries of another teleost, Salmo salar.
All of these genes are novel, with the exception of one
zebrafish and one Takifugu gene (see figure 1). We believe
that the result of the data mining approach used reflects
the total repertoire of the s100 genes in the cases of Danio
rerio, Gasterosteus aculeatus, Oryzias latipes, Tetraodon nigroviridis and Takifugu rubripes. In the case of Salmo salar several transcripts were found for each gene predicted, so that
the repertoire reported here may approximate the complete S100 family present in this species.
Because novel fish-specific S100 subclades were found, it
is necessary to expand the existing S100 nomenclature to
include these new genes (Figure 1). We suggest the following criteria (in order of importance):
1. If any ortholog of the gene was described previously,
that name is kept. This is the case for A1, A10, A11, B, P

Phylogenetic tree of the teleost and human s100 gene family
Phylogenetic tree of the teleost and human s100 gene family. A) 85 fish S100 (bony fishes in red and cartilaginous
fishes in orange), 10 lamprey S100 (light-green) with human s100 genes (full set, excluding close relatives [38], light blue) and
several representatives of another EF hand family, the troponins as an outgroup (black). B) Fish s100 genes from six teleost
species and two cartilaginous fish (Squalus acanthias and Callorhinchus milii) are depicted. Catfish S100I [18] groups with
zebrafish S100I (not shown). The Tn_S100T fragment (2nd exon, see Additional File 4) is not included for technical reasons.
The colored names indicate fish s100 genes previously published. Stars indicate that the clades downstream of the node are
supported by all three methods used for the phylogenetic analysis (NJ, ML and MP). The trees presented were constructed
using the NJ method. Bootstrap support (total 10000 replications) is indicated at the major nodes. Scale bar indicates the

and Z members of the S100 family, which have mammalian orthologs, and for the fish-specific S100I.
2. Whenever new closely related genes correspond to a
single named ortholog, that name is used, together with
an additional numeral or letter to distinguish the fish
genes from each other. This is the case e.g. for A10a and
A10b of the S100 family.

3. Novel fish-specific genes and subfamilies are named
consecutively by so far unused letters, starting with the letter Q onwards.
S100 family size in cartilaginous and even jawless fish may
be similar to that of bony fish
We have searched the available databases for S100 family
members in cartilaginous fish (Callorhinchus milii and
Squalus acanthias) and a jawless fish, Petromyzon marinus.
We report ten different S100 family members in Petro-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:48

myzon marinus and five s100 genes in Callorhinchus milii
plus one gene in Squalus acanthias (Figure 1 and Additional File 1). All genes are novel, except three genes from
Petromyzon[14], see also Additional File 2. The reported
repertoire is expected to be incomplete, especially in the
case of Callorhinchus milii, for which only 1.4 fold
genomic coverage is currently available, and of course
Squalus acanthias. Thus the total size of the cartilaginous
and jawless fish S100 repertoires may be rather similar to
that of teleost fish, despite marked sequence divergence.
The latter necessitated further rules for nomenclature:
4. If a gene from a basal taxon is clearly related to two
named genes of more derived species, we suggest to
always use the preceding letter.
5. If no clear orthologs to any named gene can be delineated, the genes are named provisionally with x1, x2 etc.
not to foreclose a coherent nomenclature for s100 genes
from basal taxa, which will only be possible after completion of the respective genome projects.
S100 is an ancient family with a complex pattern of gene
gains and losses
In order to better understand the relationships and evolutionary history of the S100 family members we performed
a phylogenetic analysis, using the Neighbor-Joining
method [21], as well as Maximum Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood analyses using the PHYLIP package [22]
(for details see Methods). Full length coding sequences of
all teleost S100 genes were analyzed together with human
S100 genes, using troponins, calmodulins and other
related calcium binding protein with EF-Hand motifs
[23,24] as outgroup (Figure 1, Additional File 1 and data
not shown). This phylogenetic analysis shows twentyseven different groups of orthologs, i.e. 27 different genes
as the combined repertoire analyzed here (Figure 1A). Six
of these genes are organized in closely related gene pairs
(s100a1/z, s100s/t, s100a10a/b). The delineation of the
s100 gene family, the identification of ortholog groups
and the association in gene pairs were supported by all
three tree-building algorithms used (Figure 1, Additional
File 1).

Nearly a third of the family members are present only in
fish – S100I and seven novel proteins, S100Q, S100R,
S100S, S100T, S100U, S100V, and S100W.
Remarkably, very few of these fish-specific genes have the
full set of five orthologs out of five fish genomes analyzed.
When salmon is taken into account, only a single gene,
s100w, is found in all 6 teleost species. In four other genes
one ortholog is missing, the Tetraodon nigroviridis gene in
s100i, the Oryzias latipes ortholog in s100u, and the s100s,
s100t genes in Salmo salar. Only four and three species

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/48

have representatives of the s100v and s100q genes, respectively. Finally, subfamily S100R is only found in pufferfish (Figure 1). On the other hand, restricted duplication
events have occurred for S100I, S100V (zebrafish,
salmon) and S100 U (pufferfish).
All teleost-restricted genes that contain both a zebrafish
and another teleost representative (S100I, S, T, U, V, W)
should have been present at least in the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of Neoteleostei and Ostariophysii
(zebrafish lineage diverged early from the more modern
neoteleosts, to which the other four species analyzed here
belong, salmon takes an intermediate position, closer to
the Neoteleostei than zebrafish). Thus, the partial absence
of several genes, e.g. S100I in pufferfish (cf. Figure 1) suggests a partial loss of these genes in the pufferfish family
(cf. Figure 2) although it cannot be ruled out with certainty that some apparent gene losses are actually caused
by inadequacies of the currently available databases.
Other examples for restricted loss in some teleost species
concern S100Q, U, V and the gene pair S100S/T (Figure 2,
cf. Figure 1B).
Two of these teleost-specific s100 genes (S100Q, R) were
not detected in the zebrafish genome despite extensive
searches. The most parsimonious explanation therefore is
an absence of these genes in the MRCA of Neoteleostei and
Ostariophysii, i.e. a genesis of these genes in the Neoteleostei
lineage (cf. Figure 2).
Six other genes are shared by teleost fish and mammalian
species (S100A1, S100A10, S100A11, S100B, S100P and
S100Z). Thus, all six genes should be more ancient than
the split in Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii, the separate teleost and tetrapod lineages. Four genes (S100A1, A10, B
and Z) are highly conserved among all six teleost species,
with at least one ortholog per species being present. However, other genes, particularly S100P, exhibit the same
partial representation in teleost species as described above
for some fish-specific s100 genes. Thus these genes appear
to have been lost in some teleost sublineages. A graphical
representation of all these phylogenetic inferences is given
in Figure 2.
Four of the six s100 genes found in the shark genome also
belong to this group of genes common to teleosts and
mammals (the remaining two exhibit no unambiguous
orthologs). One is an S100Z ortholog, two are S100B
orthologs, and one (S100A1) is situated at the root of the
S100A1-S100Z clade (Figure 1B). Thus, genes s100a1,
s100b, and s100z appear to have emerged before the divergence of cartilaginous fishes from bony fish. Since the currently available shark genome is bound to be incomplete,
it may be expected that about half of the extant s100 genes
already existed in the MRCA of cartilaginous and bony

Estimated minimal evolutionary age of S100 family members. Open rectangles represent the gene gain events in each
lineage, and black boxes represent the gene loss events. Inside each box is the name of the respective gene(s). A duplication
event leading to a gene pair is indicated by a common rectangle. The major phylogenetic transitions are indicated: bo/nobo,
bony fish/cartilaginous fish; ac/sa, actinopterygian/sarcopterygian split; os/neo, ostariophysii/neoteleostei segregation. The maximum parsimony principle was followed for construction of this scheme, i.e. minimal gene losses and gene gains were assumed.
Thus gene gains are depicted at the last possible stage before additional gains would become necessary for explanation, but
may in fact have occurred earlier, accompanied by gene loss in some lineages.

fish. Moreover, the phylogenetic position of all cartilaginous fish s100 genes deep within the teleost phylogenetic
tree demonstrates that the S100 family was already well
established before the segregation of bony and cartilaginous fish (cf. Figure 2). In fact, the S100 family even precedes the earlier split in jawed/jawless vertebrates, because
already ten family members were found in lamprey (Figure 1, Additional Files 1, 2). However, with possible
exception of two genes related to S100B and one related
to S100V, no ortholog relationship is apparent between
any of the Petromyzon marinus s100 genes and those from
more derived species.
Thus the phylogenetic tree reflects a complex evolutionary
pattern characterized by frequent gene losses as well as
extended gains of either single genes or whole gene subfamilies. Similar changes in the gene repertoire caused by
complex genomic reorganization and translocation events
are reported for EF hand proteins in general [25].

Moderate overall similarity but high degree of
conservation of motifs that are characteristic for the S100
family
The evolutionary distances between ortholog amino acid
sequences range between 0.11 and 0.82 (Figure 3B, Additional File 3), whereas paralog distances range between
0.97 and 1.18 (Additional File 3). Because of this high
heterogeneity among the S100 family and to obtain a second line of evidence in order to classify these genes reliably as members of the S100 family, we next examined the
degree of conservation of the fish and mammalian genes.
For that purpose, sequence logos from the amino acid
alignments of either the fish or mammalian S100 proteins
alone and of a combination of all the S100 proteins were
created and used for a comparative analysis (Figure 4 and
data not shown). All three sequence logos were very similar and showed the same general conservation pattern.
The previously described typical structure of the mammalian S100 proteins formed by four helices (Helix I-IV) separated by a S100 EF hand calcium-binding domain, a
hinge and a canonical EF hand calcium-binding domain

[1] is conserved among the fish S100 proteins. A high
number of conserved residues and signature motifs in
defined positions of the sequence were identified in the
teleost S100 proteins (Figure 4) and found to be conserved also among fish and tetrapods, consistent with the
origin of the S100 family well before the actinopterygian/
sarcopterygian split (Figure 2). These residues are located
mainly in the helix domains and the calcium-binding
regions, especially in the canonical EF hand. This result is
in accordance with a recent study that classifies this region
as phylogenetically older than the S100 EF hand domains
[15]. In contrast, the hinge region and the C-terminus
seem to be regions where there is more space for sequence
variability (Figure 4). This is in accordance with the observation in mammalian S100 proteins that the selectivity in

target binding is mainly assured by the hinge region and
the C-terminal tail [2,7], i.e. in these regions a larger divergence is expected at least between paralogs.
Among the highly conserved amino acids are, as expected,
the calcium-coordinating residues of the EF hands, cf. [1]
and several hydrophobic residues involved in dimerization (helices I and IV) and binding to target proteins (helices III and IV) [26,27]. A conserved cysteine close to the
end of helix IV (Figure 4, Additional File 4) has been
shown in mammalian S100A10 and A11 to stabilize the
dimer by intermolecular disulfide bridge formation
[26,27]. This cysteine is part of a conserved hydrophobic
pattern F--L---L---C---F of helix IV (hyphens indicate spacing, cf. Figure 4), which has the proper spacing to form the

Figureacid sequence conservation in the fish s100 gene repertoire
Amino 4
Amino acid sequence conservation in the fish s100 gene repertoire. Conservation is displayed as a sequence logo. In
this representation, the relative frequency with which an amino acid appears at a given position is reflected by the height of its
one-letter amino acid code in the logo, with the total height at a given position proportional to the level of sequence conservation. The regions corresponding to the Helices (H), the S100 EF Hand Calcium-binding domain, the Hinge and the Calciumbinding domain of the canonical EF Hand are numbered and indicated. Sequence alignments were manually edited (for details
see Methods section).

contact surface for dimerization. Similar conserved patterns of 3 to 5 amino acids are observed for the other three
helices (L--A---L---F---S/A, helix I; L---L---L---L, helix II; V--M--L, helix III, cf. Figure 4 and Additional File 4).
Most EF hands found in the teleost genes appear to be
functional as judged by sequence comparison, with exception of three proteins, S100R, U, V, and some neoteleost
members of the S100B subfamily. The S100R protein has
lost key residues of the canonical calcium-binding motif
in the second EF hand loop, despite a generally good conservation in both domains, similar to the human
S100A10 and A14 proteins [1]. The S100V protein has lost
most key residues of the canonical motif [1].
In four of the five neoteleost S100B proteins a common
three amino acid deletion has removed a key residue of
the S100-specific calcium-binding loop. Nearly the same
deletion also occurs in the S100V and the S100U proteins,
as well as in the human S100A7, A10, the medaka
S100A10a, and the shark CmS100B2, x2 (Additional File
4). The frequency of this deletion suggests a specialized
function for such genes, which might act either as competitive antagonists, or alternatively, may adopt the calciumbound conformation constitutively. Indeed, the latter has
been demonstrated for the human A10 protein [26,28].
S100 genes with such deletions do not segregate together
in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1, Additional File 1), and
the deletions vary slightly in length (2–4 amino acids)
and position (2 to 4 amino acids left, right, or central to
the conserved G65 in the S100 EF hand, Additional File
4). Thus, this kind of mutation has arisen several times
independently. Some of these deletion events must have
occurred in the MRCA of cartilaginous and bony fish
(S100B), others appear to have originated in the MRCA of
teleosts (S100U, V), and some are evolutionary late events
restricted to a single species (Ol_S100A10a). In other
words, this particular deletion may be considered a local

optimum in the state space of S100 sequences, consistent
with a particular function for these genes.
Strong negative selection for s100 genes, but virtual
absence of positive selection
As previously mentioned, paralog evolutionary distance at
the amino acid level is very high, with an average value of
1.08, and a range from 0.97–1.18 (Additional File 3).
Such high values pinpoint the high variability in the
amino acid sequences of these genes found at the
intraspecies level. In contrast, the average ortholog evolutionary distance value of 0.44 (with values ranging from
0.11–0.82) is about 2.5 fold lower than the one observed
for the paralog comparisons (Figure 3B, and Additional
File 3).

Prompted by both the high degree of intraspecies variability and the high degree of interspecies conservation of
s100 genes we decided to investigate the evolutionary constraints that are acting on this gene family. A strong constraint is equivalent to strong negative selection. The
degree of selective pressure is measured by investigating
the relative frequency of non-synonymous (dN) vs synonymous (dS) substitutions [29]. When the number of dN
equals the number of dS, the dN/dS ratio equals 1, which
corresponds to neutral selection. If the number of nonsynonymous changes is higher than the number of synonymous changes, then dN/dS >1, which indicates positive
selection. On the other hand, if the number of synonymous (dS) changes is higher than the number of nonsynonymous changes, then dN/dS <1 and we are in the
presence of negative selection [29]. Whenever possible,
the overall dN/dS ratio within each ortholog group was
determined. All the groups show very small values, ranging from 0.05 to 0.24, with an average global dN/dS value
of 0.14 (Figure 3A), which is evidence for strong negative
selection.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/48

These low dN/dS values combined with the high divergence between the S100 genes suggest not only an ancient
origin of these genes but also indicate that individual
genes of this family are slowly evolving.

exons (Additional File 4) show a variable position in the
N-terminal and C-terminal regions and occur in few species only, consistent with a late origin in the teleost lineage.

However, as the strong negative selection could be masking some positive selection events at the individual codon
level, we also determined the dN/dS ratio separately for
each individual sequence position. Results are shown for
two of the ortholog groups, the S100I and S100Z. These
two clades represent two different evolutionary scenarios,
the first showing evidence for recent gene duplications in
zebrafish and lacking one ortholog in Takifugu rubripes,
while the second is a very well conserved group with
orthologs in all six fish species. Also they show two different values for their evolutionary distances, of 0.47 and
0.11 respectively (see Figure 3B and Additional File 3). As
predicted by the global dN/dS analysis, a considerable
portion of the total sequence – 25% for the S100I and
35% for S100Z – is under negative selection, with the second value being closer to the average value of 31 sites per
ortholog group (Figure 3B and 3C and Additional File 5).
No evidence for positive selection was found, suggesting
that positive selection does not appear to play a significant
role in the evolution of the s100 genes.

S100 fish genes are distributed both as singletons and small
clusters in the genome
All mammalian s100a genes are clustered in the genome,
whereas S100B, G, P, and Z are located as singletons on
different chromosomes [1,30]. In zebrafish the scenario is
somewhat similar, with two smaller clusters of 3.5 and 1.0
MB each located on the chromosomes 16 and 19, respectively, and composed of seven (S100A1, S100A10b,
S100I.1, S100I.2, S100T, S100V1 and S100W) and four
(S100A10a, S100A11, S100S and S100U) genes, respectively. Similarly, in the other teleost fish species analyzed
small clusters of maximally five genes are found (cf. Additional File 2). These clusters always contain phylogenetically less related genes and, in contrast to the situation in
mammals, cluster gene associations differ between species. However, and remarkably so, there are two s100 gene
pairs, which are stably linked in the teleost genome,
whenever present in the same species, albeit not closely
related phylogenetically (S100A10a/S100I and S100A11/
S100S, cf. Figure 6 and Additional File 2). Conversely, a
closely related gene pair (S100A1/S100Z) consists of a
singleton gene (Z) and a member of a cluster (A1). Thus,
among teleost s100 genes, genomic linkage is not at all
correlated with degree of phylogenetic relationship, consistent with an ancient evolutionary origin of these clusters.

A comparison between S100I and S100Z shows rough
similarity in the pattern of negative selection (focused in
the helices I and IV and the second calcium-binding
domain), although no specific motifs could be identified
between genes (Figure 3C, D).
Gene structure of s100 genes is highly conserved between
fish and mammalian species
The mammalian s100 genes are found to have a common
structure consisting of usually three exons [5]. The first
exon contains only 5'UTR, part of the second and third
exons code for the ORF and a 3'UTR is located in the last
portion of the third exon [24]. For the fish s100 genes we
restricted analysis to the coding exons, since prediction of
noncoding UTRs is currently not very reliable. We found
that 59 of the analyzed 66 teleost s100 genes conform to
the pattern observed in ortholog genes in humans. However, another seven teleost fish genes have their ORF split
in three exons, one of them in most cases very small and
always located at one end of the ORF (Figure 5). For
zebrafish several, but not all, of these predicted exons
have been confirmed by RT-PCR (cf. Additional File 6).

Each major exon contains one complete EF-hand domain.
Without exception these two exons are joined at the same
position in the sequence (Additional File 4). Thus these
exons may be as old as the S100 family itself and the first
such gene may have arisen from a duplication of this
domain. In contrast, the intron/exon borders of the small

In total, three zebrafish genes, S100B, S100V2 and S100Z,
are present as singletons in the chromosomes 22, 19, and
21, respectively (Figure 6). This feature is conserved across
all five teleost species studied; additionally S100P, which
is absent in zebrafish, is always a singleton, whenever it
occurs (cf. Additional File 2). The isolated genomic location of these family members appears to be an evolutionary ancient feature of the S100 family, since all members
of this group also found in mammals (S100B, P, Z) share
the singleton location.
The two clusters present in zebrafish are situated on chromosomes 16 and 19, which are largely syntenic [31] and
result from the teleost-specific whole genome duplication, which occurred after the actinopterygian/sarcopterygian split [32]. Two of the three gene pairs observed in the
teleost S100 repertoire (S/T, A10a/b) are distributed
between these two clusters (Figure 6), consistent with a
duplication of their ancestral genes by this whole genome
duplication nearly 400 million years ago. This interpretation is supported by the observation that the gene pair
A10a/b has a single mammalian ortholog. Moreover, very
similar clusters are present in chromosomes 8 and 21

In contrast, other gene pairs occur closely linked in the
chromosome (e.g. the two s100i genes of zebrafish), indicating a local tandem duplication event as cause of such
gene pairs.
Expression patterns of s100 genes range from highly
specific to fairly broad distributions
To obtain an overview of the tissue specificity of expression for the whole family we performed RT-PCR with
twelve different tissues from adult zebrafish.

Orientation of the genes is indicated by left/right position

from Tetraodon nigroviridis and chromosomes 11 and 16
from Oryzias latipes (cf. Additional File 2). Both chromosome pairs are syntenic to each other, and to zebrafish
chromosomes 16 and 19 [31,32]. The third recognizable
gene pair in teleosts (A1/Z) is shared both with mammals
and with cartilaginous fish, but A1 is always a member of
a cluster (where determinable), whereas Z never is, consistent with a very ancient origin of this gene duplication,
before the emergence of the cluster itself. In total, three
genes from the human S100A cluster on chromosome 1,
A1, A10 and A11 are found in the teleost clusters.
Together with the synteny of this region of human chromosome 1 with the corresponding teleost cluster regions
[31,32] these data are consistent with a small ancestral
cluster of s100 genes in the MRCA of teleosts and tetrapods plus some isolated ancestral s100 genes.

For a higher spatial resolution of the expression patterns
at the cellular level we performed whole mount in situ
hybridization of zebrafish larvae 5 days post fertilization.
At this stage zebrafish have completed organogenesis and
major behavioral patterns are already functional. Eight of
ten genes analyzed show expression in the larval stage,
with expression patterns ranging from highly restricted to
spatially broad distributions (Figs. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
14). The results of the in situ hybridizations are often consistent with those from the RT-PCR (Figure 7). A general
tendency of the RT-PCR to show broader expression may
be related to the higher sensitivity of that method compared to in situ hybridization. Additionally, a developmental regulation, i.e. a late onset of expression, may
explain some of the differences in the results, especially
the absence of two S100 transcripts (A1 and B) in larval
tissues (although technical reasons cannot be ruled out
for A1). For S100B a late onset of expression was confirmed by the detection of strong signals in adult brain
(data not shown).
Highly restricted expression of S100 genes within the
sensory nervous system
Three zebrafish s100 genes show a remarkably restricted
expression in just one or two different larval neuronal
populations.

Zebrafish S100S is expressed in the neuromasts of the lateral line and the inner ear (Figure 12A–H). Labeled structures in the inner ear may include hair cells (Fig 12E). In
sections of the tail region the central portion of the neuromasts is labeled (Figure 12F), consistent with an expression in sensory hair cells. Thus in the larvae particular
sensory structures and possibly some neurons innervating
them are labeled. The RT-PCR results (Figure 7) show a
general expression in all sensory systems examined which
are in detail barbels and lips, brain, eyes, olfactory system
and additionally the genitourinary system.
The in situ expression pattern of S100S is quite similar to
that of the highly related zebrafish S100T, which is also
expressed in the neuromasts of the lateral line and the
inner ear (Fig 13A–G), the latter in lower levels compared
to S100S. Zebrafish develop approximately 9–12 neuro-

Figure 7 of ten s100 genes in adult zebrafish by RT-PCR
Expression
Expression of ten s100 genes in adult zebrafish by RT-PCR. mRNA was extracted from adult zebrafish tissue and transcribed into cDNA. Primer positions for PCR see Materials and Methods. Twelve different tissues were examined (barbels and
lips, bone, brain, eyes, genitourinary tissue, gills, heart, liver, muscle, olfactory bulb, olfactory epithelium, skin). Band intensity
was quantified to obtain an estimate of abundance to compare expression levels of several genes at least within the same tissue. Asterisks indicate bands at unexpected size (resulting from unspecific amplification) that were not quantified.

masts along one side [33], which have their counterparts
on the opposite side and all of them are stained by either
probe. In RT-PCR S100T expression is additionally
observed in non-sensory tissue such as bone, gills, heart,
liver and muscles.

Zebrafish S100Z (Fig 14A–E) is the gene with the spatially
most restricted expression pattern in the larvae. Only a
single tissue expresses S100Z, the olfactory placode, and
within that tissue expression is restricted to a few large
cells (Fig 14B,D,E), by morphology presumably neurons.
A far broader expression pattern in adult fish is suggested

by the RT-PCR results and may suggest a late ontogenetic
onset of expression in those tissues.
The related S100A1 was not detected at all in larval tissues,
but shows an expression in the adult genitourinary system, skin, olfactory epithelium and brain according to RTPCR-results.
Non-neuronal expression of two s100 genes, restricted to
a single cell type or tissue
Zebrafish S100A10a shows one of the most restricted patterns (Figure 8A–G). Expression is restricted to the intestinal bulb and the intestine with intestinal loops being

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/48

clearly visible. Expression slightly decreases from intestinal bulb to comparatively low levels in the anal region.
RT-PCR was negative, consistent with the described specificity (digestive tissue was not included there). The expression is limited to the epithelial cells of the intestine and
gut (Figure 8E–G).
Zebrafish S100A11 exhibits an extremely specific in situ
hybridization pattern (Fig 10A–F). S100A11 seems to be
restricted to isolated large cells located on the yolk sac and
the pericardial cavity of the fish. There are about 150 cells
labeled in the whole larva. RT-PCR with adult tissues suggests expression in gills and olfactory epithelium. The

cellular morphology, larval staining pattern and the adult
expression in gills suggest expression in MR-cells, also
known as ionocytes [34,35]. These cells control ionic
composition of body fluids, especially calcium levels.
Results obtained by RT-PCR indicate a much broader distribution, possibly at levels below the threshold for in situ
hybridization.
Three S100 genes exhibit broad expression in several
tissues and cell types
Zebrafish S100I.1 (Ictacalcin) expression (Figure 11) was
previously described by [18] and [36]. Our data are consistent with their findings of expression in the epithelial
cells of barbels, gills, olfactory rosettes and skin. S100I.1
is expressed throughout the whole skin with high levels of
expression in the rim of the dorsal (Fig 11C) and pectoral
(Fig 11F, H) fin. High expression levels were observed in
the urogenital opening (Fig 11D). Moreover, S100I.1
exhibits also strong expression in cells of the olfactory placode (Fig 11G,K). Additionally expression can be
observed throughout the pharyngeal arches (Fig 11E,I,J)
and the lateral line excluding the neuromasts (Fig 11D),
which appear as light spots in the middle of the larvae. In
this respect S100I.1 shows the complementary pattern to
S100S, T, which label the neuromasts, but not the surrounding tissue.

The in situ hybridization signals may represent the combined expression pattern of S100I.1 and S100I.2, since
their probes share over 90% homology at the nucleotide
level, and thus cross-reactivity cannot be excluded. However, RT-PCR results for S100I.1 are expected to be specific, since a primer from its unique, short exon was used.
RT-PCR results for S100I.2 probably represent a mix of
both S100I transcripts, since no completely specific primers were possible there. The results show expression of
both genes in all tissues tested, with exception of muscle,
where only S100I.2 could be detected.
Zebrafish S100A10b (Fig 9A–F) exhibits high expression
in the lower jaw (Figure 9A) in particular in the branchial
arches. Epithelial cells are labeled, but cartilaginous tissue
is devoid of staining. Olfactory placode and the whole larval trunk do not express S100A10b. Thus this expression
pattern is a subset of that observed for S100I.1. Unexpectedly, RT-PCR reveals expression of S100A10b in every tissue examined.
Partial correlation of expression pattern similarity with
coding sequence similarity
The highly related genes S100S and S100T show a nearly
identical larval expression pattern, and the duplicate
S100I genes appear to exhibit a very similar expression
pattern as well. However, expression patterns for the
duplicate A10a genes are very different, with the A10b pat-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/48

tern a subset of the unrelated S100I.1, I.2, and a completely different pattern being observed for A10a. This
partial correlation is consistent with the interpretation
that in some cases (S100S, T) regulatory elements have
been conserved alongside the coding regions of these
genes, which are spread far apart in the genome. Additionally, for the two S100I genes, which are clustered, regulatory elements shared within the cluster might synchronize
the expression pattern. In this context it is noteworthy that
the close genomic linkage of S100I to S100A10b is conserved in the genome of all fish species that possess both
genes, and indeed, A10b expression is quite similar to that
of S100I (cf. Figs. 9, 11), consistent with partially shared
regulatory elements. On the other hand, A11 and S are
also linked closely, and their expression patterns are completely different. Thus regulation of s100 gene expression
follows a complex pattern presumably involving several
different mechanisms as suggested for humans, cf. [37].

Discussion and Conclusion
The S100 family represents the largest family of calciumbinding proteins with EF hands. S100 proteins have multiple and essential functions in many different tissues,
mainly in cells of epithelial origin. However, most studies
have been performed in mammals, and the evolutionary
emergence of the family is not clear. We have performed
an extensive search in six teleost genomes and identified
in total fourteen distinct subfamilies, which constitute the
fish s100 gene repertoire. Individual species exhibit thirteen to fourteen different s100 genes. Upon closer investigation a complex pattern of gene gain and gene loss
emerges, which results in a roughly stable total repertoire
size for each species. A similar family size is observed in
amphibians (13 genes for Xenopus laevis, S.I.K., unpublished
observation), whereas a preponderance of gene gains leads
to an enlarged S100 repertoire size in mammals (23
acknowledged genes in humans [38]).
The presence of several S100 family members from cartilaginous fish (shark) deep inside the phylogenetic tree
implies that the S100 family predates at least the segregation of bony from cartilaginous fish. Moreover, already
ten members of the S100 family have been identified in a
jawless primitive fish (lamprey). Thus the origin of the
family may lie with very early vertebrate stages although
individual family members only become reliably recognizable in the time period between the jawed/jawless segregation and the divergence of cartilaginous from bony
fish around 560 to 530 million years ago [39].
The somewhat variable composition of each species repertoire suggests that gene function may be variable between
species. In fact, an A11-like gene from Xenopus [40] is
expressed in olfactory receptor neurons, i.e. may have
acquired the function served in zebrafish by S100Z. Such

negative selection within the individual s100 genes, i.e.
the evolutionary changes within the regulatory regions
may be much faster than those within the coding regions.

On the other hand, some functional specializations
appear quite stable, which may be inferred from the
expression of human S100A10 in polarized epithelia
[11,28,41] parallel to the expression of the zebrafish

S100A10a in the intestinal epithelium. However, it
should be noted that human A10 is constitutionally in
the, calcium-bound' configuration due to a deletion in the
S100 EF hand, in contrast to the zebrafish A10 genes.
Moreover, the other member of this gene pair (S100A10b)
shows a radically different distribution. Another example
is S100B, which is expressed in brain in zebrafish as well
as in mammalian species [7,42].
The genomic structure of teleost s100 genes is markedly
similar to that of mammalian genes, with two to three
coding exons in similar distances, and a conserved

domain structure of one EF hand per each main exon.
Some similarities are also observed for the genomic location. Most mammalian s100 genes lie together with some
other genes in one large cluster, the so-called epidermal
differentiation complex (EDC) [43,44] for which common regulatory elements have been discussed (but see
[37]). Two smaller clusters of four to seven members in
teleosts are syntenic to the human cluster and thus suggest
the presence of an ancestral small cluster of s100 genes.
Teleost cluster configuration does not correlate with
sequence similarity, in contrast to the mammalian EDC.
Thus the teleost clusters may represent the ancestral clus-

ter composition more closely, while extended local gene
duplications appear to have enlarged the mammalian
cluster.
While the predominantly epithelial and epithelial-derived
cellular expression of mammalian s100 genes is main-

tained in zebrafish, the actual regulatory mechanisms
responsible for this similar expression may be different.
No evidence for shared regulatory elements is observed in
teleost fish, as judged from both sequence divergence and
expression pattern similarity of neighboring genes (with
the possible exception of A10b and I1).

Zebrafish s100 genes exhibit highly specific and characteristically different patterns of expression like their mammalian counterparts (cf. [11-13]). Duplicated genes show
both redundancy and divergence in their expression pattern. Larval expression is limited to different types of epithelial cells and neural cells of epithelial origin (olfactory
receptor neurons, hair cells and ionocytes). Our findings
provide a firm basis for unraveling the molecular nature
of the S100-like immunoreactivity observed in teleost fish
tissues in several earlier publications, e.g. [45-47].
Taken together we have identified and characterized the
teleost s100 gene family with respect to gene structure and
expression pattern. These genes exhibit characteristics
similar to the mammalian gene family in several respects.
Considering the importance of s100 genes in the pathogenesis of epidermal disease – particular S100 proteins are
markedly over expressed in psoriasis, wound healing, skin
cancer, inflammation, cellular stress, and other epidermal

pathological states [30] – it appears advantageous to study
these processes in the zebrafish model system (cf. [48]).

Methods
Zebrafish strains and maintenance
All zebrafish used in this experiment were obtained from
matings of the Ab/Tü strain (Oregon, AB/Tübingen, Tü).
Breeding and raising of zebrafish followed standard protocols [49].
Data mining
All annotated fish and mammalian S100 sequences were
extracted either from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or Ensembl database resources
[50] and used in the subsequent phylogenetic analysis, if
they conformed to the inclusion criteria detailed below.
Representative fish genes from each subclade and additionally, 19 human S100 genes (full set excluding close
relatives [38]) were used as query in tBLASTN searches in

Page 19 of 23
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:48

the NCBI nucleotide databases nr/nt, EST [51] and in the
ENSEMBL database [50]. For elephant shark (Callorhinchus milii) only WGS traces were available, and for salmon
(Salmo salar) only the EST database was used. The analysis
was repeated using newly found subclades as query. To be
considered as validated S100 genes, the candidates
needed to fulfill the following inclusion criteria: a) position within the S100 clade in the phylogenetic analysis; b)
application of the BLASTP algorithm in the NCBI nonredundant database should result in annotated S100 or
some other S100 candidates as first hits; c) presence of
four helices separated by one S100 EF hand, one hinge
and one canonical S100 hand (region assignment according to [1]) within 80 to 100 consecutive amino acids,
which is the extent observed for this composite motif for
all mouse and human S100 genes.
For Accession numbers see Additional File 2.
Phylogenetic analysis
MAFFT, version 5.8 [52], was employed for multiple protein alignments using the E-INS-i strategy with the default
parameters. To estimate the phylogenetic relationships of
the sequences we performed distance-based, maximum
parsimony, and maximum likelihood analyses using the
Neighbour Joining (NJ), Protpars (MP) and Proml (ML)
programs as implemented in ClustalX [53] and PHYLIP
[22], packages respectively. For the NJ method we performed bootstrapping with 10000 repetitions using ClustalX [53] and for the MP and ML methods we performed
bootstrapping with 100 repetitions using the program SEQBOOT from the PHYLIP package [22]. The three methods
gave similar clustering. Consensus trees were obtained
using the CONSENSE program of the PHYLIP package
[22].

Subclades within the teleost S100 gene family were determined from the tree as the largest clades that fulfilled two
criteria: the clade had >80% bootstrap support in the NJ
analysis (S100Q is the only exception with 71%) and is
supported both in the MP and ML analysis. Fourteen such
subclades were identified, which correspond to groups of
orthologous genes.
Evolutionary distances
The evolutionary distances between amino acid sequences
were calculated using MEGA4 [54]. All results were based
on the pairwise analysis of the given number of sequences
per ortholog or paralog group. Analyses were conducted
using the Poisson correction method in MEGA4 [54,55].
All positions containing alignment gaps and missing data
were eliminated only in pairwise sequence comparisons
(Pairwise deletion option).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/48

Sequence logos
Sequence logos were generated using a web-based program, Weblogo, version 2.8.2. developed by Crooks [56]
and Schneider and Stevens [57,58]. A logo was generated
with 85 teleost and cartilaginous fish S100 amino acid
sequences. Sequence alignments were manually edited
using MEGA 4 [54] and highly divergent pieces between
the start codon and the beginning of helix 1 were trimmed
to avoid N-terminal length heterogeneity. This did not
affect significantly conserved residues. Gap positions
present in more than 85% of the sequences were deleted
completely.
dN/dS Analysis
The global dN/dS ratios for the full length S100 coding
sequences of all five teleost species for which full genomic
information is available were determined using the
HyPhy package on the datamonkey server [59], which
implements a previously published method [60]. The
nucleotide alignment was manually edited and gap positions present in more than 85% of the sequences were
removed.

To make inferences about selective pressure (positive and
negative selection) on individual codons (sites) within
the S100 coding sequences, the Single Likelihood Ancestor Counting (SLAC) package [61] was used, which implements the Suzuki-Gojobori method [60].
The algorithm is briefly outlined. First, a best-fitting
nucleotide substitution model was automatically selected
by fitting several such substitution models to both the
data and a neighbor-joining tree generated from the alignment described above. Taking the obtained substitution
rates and branch lengths as constant, a codon model was
employed to fit to the data and a global dN/dS ratio was
calculated. Then a codon by codon reconstruction of the
ancestral sequences was performed using maximum likelihood. Afterwards the expected normalized (ES) and
observed numbers (EN) of synonymous (NS) and nonsynonymous (NN) substitutions were calculated for each
non-constant site. dN = NN/EN and dS = NS/ES were then
computed, and if dN < dS (negative selection) or dN > dS
(positive selection), a p-value derived from a two-tailed
extended binomial distribution was used to assess significance. Tests on simulated data (S.L.K. Pond and S.D.W.
Frost, methods available at [61] show that p values equal
or smaller than 0.1 identify nearly all true positives with a
false positive rate generally below the nominal p value; for
actual data, the number of true positives at a given false
positive rate is lower. In the present study, two thresholds
for significance (0.1 and 0.2) were taken into account.
RT-PCR
Ten zebrafish (mix of male and female Danio rerio, strain
Ab/Tü) were dissected and several tissues were pooled for

each RNA extraction: barbels and lips, bone, brain, eyes,
genitourinary, gills, heart, liver, muscle, olfactory bulb,
olfactory epithelium, skin. cDNA was generated by using
Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with an
anchored oligo18(dT) reverse primer. PCR amplifications
were performed by using the following primer pairs, all of
them (except S100B) intron-spanning:

used for signal detection. Results were documented with a
Nikon CoolPix 950 digital camera attached to a Nikon
SMZ-U binocular for whole mount images. Cryosections
of hybridized embryos, obtained by a Leica CM1900 cryostat were documented on a Zeiss AxioVert microscope
and an attached Diagnostic Instruments Spot-RT camera.

The following conditions were used: 2 min at 96°C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 sec at 96°C, 30 sec at 60°C, and
60 sec at 72°C, and a final extension of 10 min at 72°C.
Regions chosen for PCR primers did not exhibit any
appreciable sequence identity to each other (with exception of I2 primers, which may additionally recognize I1,
but not vice versa), thereby excluding cross-amplification.
All PCR products were cloned and sequenced using standard protocols. For sequences see Additional File 6.
In Situ Hybridization
The templates for the probes were amplified from cloned
fragments obtained by RT-PCR using the previously
described primers with the T3 promoter site (TATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGAA) attached to their 5' end. Digoxigenin (DIG) probes were synthesized according to the
DIG RNA labeling kit supplier protocol (Roche Molecular
Biochemicals).

RNA in situ hybridization of S100 genes was carried out
following the method of Thisse et al [62] as modified in
[63]. Hybridizations were performed on 5 dpf old larvae
overnight at 62°C. Anti-DIG primary antibody coupled to
alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)
