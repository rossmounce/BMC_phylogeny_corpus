Abstract
Background: Understanding swine influenza virus (SIV) ecology has become more and more important from both
the pig industry and public health points of views. However, the mechanism whereby SIV occurs in pig farms is
not well understood. The purpose of this study was to develop a proper strategy for SIV surveillance.
Findings: We conducted longitudinal monitoring in 6 farrow-to-finish farms in the central region of Thailand from
2008 to 2009. Nasal swabs and serum samples were collected periodically from clinically healthy pigs consisting of
sows, fattening pigs, weaned piglets and pigs transferred from other farms. A total of 731 nasal swabs were
subjected to virus isolation and 641 serum samples were subjected to detection of SIV antibodies against H1 and
H3 subtypes using the hemagglutination inhibition test and ELISA. Twelve SIVs were isolated in this study and
eleven were from piglets aged 4 and 8 weeks. Phylogenetical analysis revealed that SIVs isolated from different
farms shared a common ancestor. Antibodies against SIVs were detected in fattening pigs on farms with no SIV
isolation in the respective periods studied. These observations suggested that piglets aged 8 weeks or younger
could be a main target for SIV isolation. Farm-to-farm transmission was suggested for farms where pigs from other
farms are introduced periodically. In addition, antibodies against SIVs detected in fattening pigs could be a marker
for SIV infection in a farm.
Conclusions: The present study provided important information on SIV surveillance that will enable better
understanding of SIV ecology in farrow-to-finish farms.

Background
Swine influenza virus (SIV) is one of the pathogens that
cause respiratory diseases accompanied with coughing
and sneezing in pigs [1]. This virus is considered an
important pathogen not only from the viewpoint of animal health but also from that of public health [1-3]. Pigs
can play the role of a ‘mixing vessel’ producing a novel
influenza virus by genetic reassortment [4] as they have
dual susceptibility to both human and avian influenza
viruses [5]. Both receptors, namely, the sialic acid linked
to galactose by an a2,6 linkage (SAa2,6Gal) for human

viruses and an SAa2,3Gal for avian viruses, are
expressed on epithelial cells of the tracheal and pulmonary structures of pigs [6,7]. The segmented nature of
genomes of influenza A viruses allows the exchange of
the gene segments when a pig is infected simultaneously
with various viruses.
A novel H1N1 virus, later designated as a pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 (H1N1pdm) virus, was first identified in
April 2009 when it caused the first influenza pandemic
in humans in the 21st century [8]. Origin of the NA and
M gene segments of H1N1pdmv was found to be from
an Eurasian avian-like H1N1 SIV while the remaining 6
segments were from a triple reassortant H1 SIV mainly
circulating in North American swine [8]. Since it was
discovered that H1N1pdmv is a reassortant between the

periodically to collect nasal swabs and blood samples
three or more times from June 2008 to November 2009
(Table 1). Both samples were taken from 8 to 20 pigs in
each of at least 3 different groups from farms B-F. Each
group consisted of sows aged at least one year, fattening
pigs aged from 3 to 4 months, and weaned piglets aged
from 4 to 10 weeks. Specimens were also collected from
pigs transferred from other farms to Farm B, C or E at
the age of 8 weeks to 1 year since January 2009. Only
nasal swabs were collected in Farm A in January 2008
and in Farm D in June 2008. Ten blood samples and
twenty nasal swabs were collected from 20 pigs introduced in Farm B in September and November 2009.
The sample size for each group allowed the detection of
at least one positive pig at 95% confidence limits if the
prevalence in each group exceeded 20-30% [21]. Epidemiological information of each farm was obtained by
interviewing the farmers as listed in Table 1.

two SIVs above, SIVs have attracted much attention
from researchers worldwide.
Ecology of SIVs is highly complicated due to multiple
genetic reassortments, although three subtypes H1N1,
H1N2 and H3N2 are dominant in swine populations [1].
Avian-like H1N1 SIVs originally circulating among European pig populations have been found in China [9].
Triple reassortant H1N2 and H3N2 SIVs possessing
genes from avian, human and swine viruses were found
not only in North America [10,11] but also in South
Korea [12] and Hong Kong [9]. World-wide dissemination of SIVs is considered to be linked with the transportation of breeding pigs. In addition, transmission of
the H1N1pdmv from humans to domesticated animals,
such as pigs in Argentina, South Korea and Canada
[13-15], turkeys in Canada and Chile [16,17] and so on,
has been demonstrated. Thus, viruses can generate
novel genetic combinations that could arise anywhere in
the world. A reassortant virus between H1N1pdmv and
other SIVs has already been found in pig populations in
Hong Kong at 9 months after the emergence of
H1N1pdmv [9]. In such a situation, SIV control in a pig
farm is crucial to prevent further genetic reassortment
events in pigs that may trigger other pandemics in
humans.
The pig industry in Thailand has been expanding
rapidly as one of the major livestock industries since the
1970s [18]. Our previous study revealed that H1N1,
H1N2 and H3N2 of SIVs circulated in Thailand from
2000 to 2005, and had acquired genetic diversity due to
multiple introductions of classic swine, Eurasian avianlike swine and human viruses [19]. In addition, transmission of human viruses to pig [19] or vice versa [20]
was also suggested. However, ecology and the prevalence of SIVs in the Thai pig population have not been
well characterized. Here, we carried out longitudinal
monitoring in farrow-to-finish farms in three provinces
in the central region of Thailand from 2008 to 2009. Six
farms consisting of two small family-operated farms,
one middle sized farm and three large sized commercial
farms were monitored. Both nasal swabs and serum
samples were collected periodically from 4 different pig
groups, namely, sow, fattening pigs, weaned piglets and
pigs newly introduced into the farm. Virological and serological analyses in this study provided significant information needed to establish a strategy for SIV
monitoring in farrow-to-finish farms.

All the nasal swabs were subjected to virus isolation at
the National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH), Thailand as described previously [22]. Briefly, nasal swabs
collected were immediately placed into a 15-ml tube
containing 2 ml transport medium (MEM containing
Penicillin (1000 unit/ml), Streptomycin (1000 μg/ml),
Fungizone (25 μg/ml), 0.01 M HEPES and 0.5% bovine
serum albumin). After centrifugation for 10 min at 2500
rpm, they were aliquoted. One portion was inoculated
onto the monolayer of MDCK cells after filtering with a
0.45 μm pore size filter (Millipore, MA, USA). After
viral adsorption to the cells, growth medium containing1 μg/ml of acetylated trypsin rather than fetal calf
serum was added. If neither cytopathogenic effect nor
HA activity with 1% guinea pig red blood cells was
observed at 4 days after inoculation, the collected supernatant was inoculated in MDCK cells once more.
Another portion including the nasal swab was subjected
to viral RNA extraction using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), followed by RT-PCR using primers specific to either NP [23] or M [24]genes of the
type A influenza virus. Subtypes were identified by the
PCR method using specific primers designed in a previous study [19].
Direct sequencing of the PCR products and phylogenetic analysis of the viruses isolated in this study were
carried out as described previously [19].

Collection of samples and epidemiological information

Serum was obtained from the collected blood samples
by centrifugation for 10 min at 3500 rpm. All of the
serum samples were subjected to the hemagglutination
inhibition (HI) test and ELISA. Antigens used for the HI
tests were A/swine/Ratchaburi/NIAH550/2003 (H1N1;

Forty nasal swabs were collected from 20 sows aged
from 1 to 2 years, 10 fattening pigs aged 12 weeks and
10 weaned piglets aged 9 weeks in Farm A in January
2008. Five farms, B, C, D, E and F, were visited

Serum samples for the HI test were treated overnight
with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) from Vibrio
Cholerae (Denka Seiken Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) to
remove any non-specific inhibitors of hemagglutination,
and were then inactivated at 56°C for 30 min. Next, the
serum samples were absorbed with packed chicken red
blood cells for 60 min at room temperature. A cut off
value of 1:40 was adopted to avoid false-positive cases
due to non-specific reactions in the HI tests. Commercial ELISA kits (The HerdChek Swine Influenza H1N1
Antibody Test Kit and HerdChek Swine Influenza
H3N2 Antibody Test Kit, IDEXX LABORATORIES,
Inc., Maine, USA) were used to detect antibodies against
‘classical’ H1 and ‘human-like’ H3 SIV HAs according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.

Results
Epidemiological observations of the farms surveyed

A total of 731 nasal swabs and 641 serum samples were
collected from six farms in the Ratchaburi, Saraburi and
Singburi provinces in the central region of Thailand
(Figure 1). All specimens were collected from clinically
healthy pigs without influenza-like symptoms. There
had been no movement of pigs between the farms investigated. Distance to the nearest pig farm from Farm A
was 200 meters and that from Farm B was approximately 5 km. Owners of Farms C, D, E and F claimed
that no pig farm existed in their vicinity. Total numbers
of pigs in each farm on average ranged from 121 to
20,000. All of the farms visited were farrow-to-finish
operated with pigs that are bred and fattened in each

farm (Table 1). Pigs born in each farm are moved at
least three times during their lifetime. Piglets were
weaned from sows at 3 to 4 weeks old, and the weaning
stage at the nursery house was until they were 6 to 11
weeks old (Table 1). After the fattening stage, they were
sent to the slaughter houses at approximately 24 weeks
old. Sows and newly introduced gilts were of YorkshireLandrace crosses, on the other hand, boars were Duroc
in all of the farms. Farms A, B and C introduced pigs
from domestic farms periodically, whereas D, E and F
seldom did. Farm A introduces a few pigs as sows every

few years while Farm B introduces 20-25 female breeding pigs at the age of 8 weeks every week, and Farm C
about 50 pigs at the age of 5 to 6-months every week.
The pigs are kept in quarantine piggeries for approximately 3 or 4 months in Farms B and C. After the
absence of clinical signs is confirmed, they are moved to
the breeding piggery for farrow. Farm D purchased 20
boars in 2004 from Denmark. Farms A and B had
shower-in facilities for the entry of both cars and
humans into the farms, and Farm C had such facilities
for cars only. Domesticated animals other than pigs
were kept on Farms A, B, E and F. Most of the piggeries
in the farms were open or half-open providing easy
access to wild birds and animals. In Farm B, porcine
reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) occurred
in piglets in the nursery house one week prior to the
sampling on November 18, 2009. There was no report
of respiratory diseases in pigs other than the incident in
Farm B throughout the period of our monitoring. Vaccination was given as shown in Table 1 and that against
swine influenza was not used in the farms investigated.
Virus isolation

Figure 1 Geographical location of the provinces where the
surveillance was conducted in this study.

Twelve viruses consisting of 10 H1N1 SIVs and 2 H3N2
SIVs were isolated from 731 swabs collected (Table 2).
Total virus isolation rate was 1.6% (4.2% in piglets aged
from 3 to 5 weeks, 4.2% in piglets aged from 6 to 10
weeks, 0.5% in fattening pigs aged from 12 to 16 weeks,
0% in pigs aged more than 18 weeks) (Figure 2). Pigs
proven to be infected with SIVs by virus isolation were
4 to 12 weeks old. All of the nasal swabs yielding viruses
in MDCK cells were positive by conventional PCR with
influenza specific primers (NP or M). Viruses were

isolated after 3-4 days incubation following the inoculation of each swab except one. The excluded swab
required a second passage in MDCK and the virus titer
in the original swab was 100.8 TCID50/ml, which was the
lowest TCID50/ml of the swabs that yielded viruses in
this study.
Nine out of 10 H1N1 viruses isolated throughout the
study appeared to share a common ancestor with the
Thai SIVs identified in our previous study [19]. A/
swine/Ratchaburi/NIAH101942/2008
(H1N1)
(Rat101942) was isolated from a 12-week old fattening
pig in Farm A [22]. Three H1N1 SIVs, designated as A/
swine
Saraburi/NIAH100761-22/2009
(H1N1)
(Sara100761-22), A/swine/Saraburi/NIAH100761-23/
2009 (H1N1), and A/swine/Saraburi/NIAH100761-26/
2009 (H1N1), were isolated from 4-week-old weaned
piglets kept in the same compartment on January
14,2009 in Farm B (Table 2). Five H1N1 SIVs were also
isolated in Farm B from 8-week-old weaned piglets on
November 18, 2009. They were designated as A/swine/
Saraburi/NIAH116625-11/2009 (H1N1) (Sara11662511), A/swine/Saraburi/NIAH116625-12/2009 (H1N1), A/
swine/Saraburi/NIAH116625-13/2009 (H1N1), A/swine/
Saraburi/NIAH116625-16/2009 (H1N1), and A/swine/
Saraburi/NIAH116625-17/2009 (H1N1). Rat101942
shared more than 98.2% and 97.6% nucleotide identities
with Sara100761-22 and Sara116625-11 in each segment, respectively. Sara100761-22 and Sara11625-11
shared more than 99.4% nucleotide identities in all of
the eight gene segments. Based on the phylogenetic analyses of all gene segments, the gene constellation was
similar to those of Thai SIVs isolated from 2004 to 2005

and represented by A/swine/Chonburi/NIAH589/2005
(H1N1) and A/swine/Chachoengsao/NIAH587/2005
(H1N1) in our previous study [19] (Additional file 1:
Supplementary Figures S1-S3). HA genes of the current
isolates belonged to the Clb cluster of the classical
swine lineage (Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure
S1), while PA (Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure
S2) and M genes to the ALb cluster and NA, PB2, PB1,
NP and NS (Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure S3)
genes belonged to ALa within the Eurasian avian-like
swine lineage (Table 2). A/swine/Saraburi/NIAH11662724/2009 (H1N1) (Sara116627-24) was isolated in Farm
D from a weaned piglet at the age of 8 weeks (Table 2).
Sequencing analysis confirmed that all of the eight gene
segments of Sara116627-24 originated from H1N1pdmv
(Table 2).
Two H3N2 SIVs, A/swine/Saraburi/NIAH107725-28/
2008 (H3N2) (Sara107725-28) and A/swine/Saraburi/
NIAH109713-36/2009 (H3N2) (Sara109713-36), were
isolated from Farm B. Sara107725-28 was isolated from
a weaned piglet at the age of 4 weeks on June 9, 2008.
Sara109713-36 was isolated from an 8-week-old introduced piglet on July 1, 2009. They shared high nucleotide homologies of more than 96.7% in each segment
and their gene constellations were similar and identical
with that of A/swine/Ratchaburi/NIAH874/05 (H3N2),
reported elsewhere [19] (Additional file 1: Supplementary Figures S2-S4). The HA (Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure S4) and NA genes belonged to the Ha
cluster, which is one of the two distinct human-like
Thai SIV clusters existing within the human H3N2
lineages [19]. NP and NS (Additional file 1: Supplementary Figure S3) genes belonged to Cla which is a different cluster from Clb formed by Thai isolates within a
classical swine lineage [19]. The remaining genes were
clustered in an ALa sub-cluster of Eurasian avian-like
SIVs (Table 2).
Serologic results of farms surveyed in this study

In the analysis of sero-reactivities of the collected serum
against the H1 subtype, different reactivities were
observed between the ELISA and HI tests (Table 3).
Positive rate in the ELISA was equal or higher than that
obtained for the HI tests with 4 different antigens in
most of the cases. For the serum collected from sows in
Farm B in June 2008, however, positive rates against
Cla, Clb and Iowa were higher than those with the
ELISA. Also, for the serum collected in Farm E in January 2009, higher rates were observed with Cla, Clb and
Iowa as the antigens. Positive reactions against the
H1N1pdm antigen were observed in Farms C and E
even before the virus appeared in the human population.
However, it seemed that those reactions were most
likely due to cross-reactions with the antigen, since the

positive rates were always less than those against other
antigens except in Farm D where H1N1pdmv was
indeed isolated (Table 3).
In Farms B and C, some sows were always seropositive
against H1 antigens whereas fattening and weaned pigs
in Farm B did not show any positivity towards the H1
antigens in November 2009 (Table 3). Pigs introduced
at the age of 8 weeks in Farm B did not show positivity
towards any of the H1 antigens in July 2009 and
November 2009. In Farm C, weaned pigs did not show
any positivity towards the H1 antigens from October
2008 to November 2009. In contrast, pigs introduced in
Farm C from 5 to 6 months of age in July 2009 and
November 2009 showed positivity towards the H1
antigens.
In Farms D and F, no pig positive for the H1 antigens
used was found until July 2009 (Table 3). All sera from
sows collected in Farm D in November 2009 were positive in the HI test with Sara116627-24 (H1N1pdmv). At
that time, 8 out of 10 fattening pigs and 1 out of 10
weaned piglets were also positive towards H1N1pdmv in
Farm D.

In Farm E, the number of seropositive pigs apparently
increased in January 2009 in all the groups (Table 3).
Although only one or two sows were positive towards
classical H1 before 2009, 3 to 5 out of 8 sows showed
positivity in the ELISA and HI tests in January 2009. At
that time, 9 out of 10 fattening pigs were positive
towards Cla and Clb, and 3 of them were positive in the
ELISA and HI test using Iowa. In addition, more than 4
weaned piglets were positive towards Cla, Clb and Iowa
at the same time. Three pigs introduced at the age of 1
year at 1 day prior to the sampling in January 2009
were serologically negative towards classical H1 SIVs.
Clear contrast was seen in the reactivity of the serum
against Ha and Hb viruses in the HI tests of the H3
subtype (Table 4). Seropositive pigs against the Hb virus
were found in Farm C only, whereas pigs positive
towards the Ha virus were found in Farms B, D, E and
F and they were negative towards the Hb virus. No significant correlation between the reactivity with the
ELISA and Ha or Hb viruses was seen, since in several
occasions only positives towards the ELISA were
observed.

In Farms B, C and E, as seen for the H1 serology,
sows were positive towards the H3 antigens in all occasions, whereas fattening and weaned pigs in Farm B
were negative in November 2009 (Table 4). Fattening
and weaned pigs were negative at all occasions in Farm
C. In Farm E, the tests were negative in June 2008. A
few sows were found positive by ELISA twice during the
surveillance in Farm D. In Farm F, sows were positive
on three occasions by ELISA and/or the HI test with
the Ha antigen and one weaned pig was positive by
ELISA in October 2008.

Discussion
The mechanisms of SIV introduction in farrow-to-finish
pig farms in Thailand have not been well studied. In
this study, we conducted a longitudinal surveillance in
farrow-to-finish pig farms located in the central part of
Thailand to develop a proper strategy for SIV surveillance. We found that young pigs, in particular, piglets at
the age of 8 weeks or younger could be the target animals to isolate SIVs circulating in farms. Seroprevalence
against SIVs in fattening pigs was evidence that SIV
infection did occur within farms, while results of a phylogenetical analysis suggested that farm-to-farm transmission had occurred. In addition, a discrepancy
between the HI test and ELISA suggested the possibility
that the sub-lineages of H1 and H3 SIVs that have not
yet been isolated may be circulating in the Thai pig
population. Thus, information obtained in this study
would be useful for conducting SIV surveillances in farrow-to-finish farms.
In this study, SIVs were most frequently isolated from
weaned piglets aged 4 and 8 weeks. Previous findings
also pointed out that the majority of SIV infections take
place in piglets aged under 10 weeks [25]. Weaned piglets are considered to be susceptible to SIVs because the
concentration of the maternal antibodies against SIVs in
the serum declines with age in piglets [26], and the half
life of antibodies against H1 and H3 SIVs was estimated
to be 12 days [25]. The high density of pigs in piggeries
and large size herds is a contributing factor to the high
SIV prevalence rates in fattening pigs and sows [27,28].
Thus, gathering of weaned piglets in one nursery
together with other piglets farrowed from different sows
is another likely factor contributing to the high isolation
rate in weaned piglets in farrow-to-finish farms.
Dissemination of the SIV of a particular genotype was
suggested based on the fact that the H1N1 SIVs isolated
from Farms A and B shared a common ancestor. Pigs
and other materials were not transferred between farms
and moreover, the farms were separated geographically
by more than 100 km, suggesting that SIVs have spread
extensively in Thailand. The introduction of pigs carrying SIVs is one of the most likely factors for viral

Page 8 of 11

dissemination among farms [1]. The isolation of
Sara109713-36 from a pig introduced to Farm B may
have originated from the farm from which this pig was
introduced. At the same time, there remains a possibility
that the pig was infected after being introduced to the
farm, because the affected pig was introduced into Farm
B 4 days prior to the sampling date. A period of 4 days
is known to be enough for pigs to start virus shedding
after experimental infection [29]. The other pigs introduced earlier than the affected pig were also in the same
quarantined piggery, although they were separated into
different compartments. In addition, there were no regulations for the movement of humans between piggeries
(quarantine piggery, breeding/farrowing sites, weaned
sites and fattening sites) in that farm.
Serological analysis revealed that the detection of antibodies against SIVs in fattening pigs could be an indicator of SIV infection in a farrow-to-finish farm. Maternal
antibodies declined in fattening pigs aged 3 to 4 months
[26,30]. In addition, fattening pigs were replaced with
neonatal pigs at each sampling in this study. Thus, fluctuations in the seropositive rate observed in fattening
pigs indicated that SIV infection occurred prior to each
sampling. On the other hand, neither the antibodies
found in serum of weaned piglets nor those in sows
could be used as an indicator of the recent SIV occurrence in a farm. Serological tests cannot distinguish
maternal antibodies from those due to SIV infection.
Sows are kept in a farm for more than a few years and
antibodies against classical H1 SIVs in a pig are known
to last up to more than 1 year after the primary infection [29]. Thus, detection of the antibodies cannot indicate a recent infection of the sows. In farms such as
Farms B and C where gilts are frequently introduced, it
is not clear whether the seropositive sow was infected
with SIVs before or after it was introduced into the
farm.
The presence of seropositive fattening pigs in Farms C
and E suggested SIV infection, however, no SIV was isolated. Sero-positive reaction was always observed against
H1 SIVs in fattening pigs in Farm C, and an apparent
increase in the number of fattening pigs seropositive
against H1 SIVs was observed in January 2009 in Farm
E. The reason why SIVs were not isolated in these farms
may be explained by the fact that SIVs could circulate
continuously in those farms with a prevalence rate
lower than the detection limit rate in our sampling
numbers. Sows were suggested to be a reservoir for continuous circulation of some respiratory pathogens (eg.
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Porcine Circovirus
type-2, SIVs) in a farm. Antibodies against those pathogens were detected at high rates in the sow population
in a farm [31]. Indeed, sows showed the highest seropositive rate in most samplings among the 4 groups

Takemae et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:537
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/537

examined in this study, suggesting the possibility that
sows are repeatedly infected with SIVs during their 4 to
5 years of stay on a farm. Frequent introduction of pigs
into a farm, such as Farm C, could also allow viral entry
into the fattening pig population. In addition, movement
of people/materials between farms could also be a possible route of entry of SIVs as was the case in Farm E
where pigs were seldom introduced. Thus, further investigation is necessary to elucidate the mechanism of SIV
persistence in farms.
Serological analysis suggested that SIVs belonging to
unidentified sub-lineages within classical H1 and
human-like H3 viruses likely exist in the Thai pig population. HI tests using various antigens revealed that antigenicity of the antigens within the subtypes in both H1
and H3 can vary. IDEXX ELISA often detected antibodies in serum samples that showed up negative in the
HI tests. The antigens selected for use in the HI tests of
this study represented SIVs circulating in Thailand
according to our previous study [19]. The ELISA test
appeared to detect antibodies that could not be detected
by the HI tests with the antigens used. This suggests
that viruses possessing antigenicities different from
those of the SIVs used in this study may be circulating
in the Thai pig population.
H1N1pdmv infection in pigs in Thailand was detected
in Farm D during our longitudinal monitoring. Direct
human to pig transmission was suspected as was the
case in pig farms in other countries [13,32], because the
affected farm had not introduced pigs since 2004. Based
on the serological results, there is the possibility that
H1N1pdmv was first introduced into sows before
November 2009, and it then spread to fattening pigs
and piglets within the farm. In Thailand, the number of
confirmed human cases of H1N1pdmv infection
increased from 8,800 to 28,300 from the end of June to
October 2009 [33]. Until July 3, 2009, the affected farm
was shown to be free of H1N1pdmv by retrospective
serological analysis. Remarkably, no significant clinical
symptom was observed in the piglets carrying the virus
at the time of swab collection, which is unlike other
H1N1pdmv infections in pigs that have been reported
along with respiratory symptoms [13,32]. Therefore, the
actual number of H1N1pdmv cases in the pig population may be much higher than that reported worldwide.
According to the OIE weekly diseases information, up
to March 2011, H1N1pdmv infection in pigs had been
reported in 21 countries/districts [34]. Emergence of
reassortants with H1N1pdmv and other SIVs in pigs
could be a threat to public health [35,36]. In addition,
transmission of H1N1pdmv from humans to pigs could
have caused the amino acid changes in the HA, NA, M
and NP genes, suggesting the possibility of a significant
impact on viral evolution [37]. Thus, to minimize the

Page 9 of 11

risk of H1N1pdmv infection in pigs, extensive bio-security protocols for farms need to be considered.
Many researchers have pointed out the importance of
monitoring SIVs because pigs have the potential role as
a mixing vessel for influenza viruses [1,4]. To date,
highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses have
been isolated sporadically in China [38] and Indonesia
[39]. H9N2 viruses that infect not only poultry but also
humans [40,41] were isolated from pigs from 1998 to
2007 in China. Under such circumstances, it is important that knowledge on the occurrence of SIVs in farms
be deepened. The information obtained in this study
could be useful to develop a strategy for SIV surveillance not only in Thailand but also in other countries,
since the farrow-to-finish production system is commonly conducted worldwide. Crucial factors that determine the persistence and infection of SIVs in farms
remain unclear. Further studies on SIVs in farms are
needed in order to prevent economical losses caused by
these viruses, and to prevent the emergence of novel
viruses with the potential to cause pandemics in
humans.

Conclusions
In the present study, we conducted SIV surveillance in 6
farrow-to-finish farms in the central part of Thailand
from 2008 to 2009. Twelve SIVs including 10 H1N1 and
2 H3N2 subtypes were isolated from 731 nasal swabs.
All of the SIVs were isolated solely from young pigs
aged from 4 to 12 weeks in the farrow-to-finish farms
surveyed. Meanwhile, from the serological analyses, the
seroprevalence against SIVs observed in fattening pigs
showed evidence of recent SIV occurrence even in the
farms where no SIVs had been isolated. Thus, these two
findings could be potent tools for conducting SIV surveillances in farrow-to-finish farms.
