Abstract
The draft genome sequence of cattle (Bos taurus) has now been analyzed by the Bovine Genome
Sequencing and Analysis Consortium and the Bovine HapMap Consortium, which together
represent an extensive collaboration involving more than 300 scientists from 25 different countries.

Commentary
The cattle genome [1,2] was originally selected for
sequencing because of the unique biology of ruminants,
the importance of ruminants as a major source of protein
nutrition for humans, and the evolutionary position of
cattle relative to other mammals [3]. Wide-ranging and
detailed analyses of the genome sequence and population
based variation within the sequence are reported in 22
companion publications, the majority of which appear in
the BioMed Central group of journals published in April
2009, appropriately, the Year of the Ox. A full list of companion papers and other materials can be found at [4].
These reports provide remarkable insight into mammalian evolution, ruminant biology, and the origins of cattle
breeds and impacts of domestication on the species.
At present, there are approximately 3.4 billion domesticated cattle, buffalo, sheep and goats in the world which
provide a major source of protein nutrition for 6.6 billion
humans [5]. About three quarters of the world's agricultural land produces forage suitable for grazing by these

ruminants, which have an astonishing capacity to efficiently convert low quality plant fibre that is often unsuitable for human use into energy dense fat, muscle and
milk. This biological process has long been exploited by
humans. Ruminants are also valued for their hides, hair
and work capacity. Indeed, the social and cultural evolution of humans, particularly as they adopted an agrarian
lifestyle, is intimately intertwined with ruminant domestication, which began in the Near East some 8,000–
10,000 years ago [6,7]. The bull and cow have been symbols of human prosperity and political power and, in
some cultures, have attained the status of religious icons.
The growth of domesticated ruminant populations, especially cattle, has mirrored the rapid expansion of the
human population. More than 800 cattle breeds have
been selected by humans since domestication for different
economic, social and religious reasons and these represent an important world heritage and a unique scientific
resource [8]. While the hand of humans has certainly
sculpted the genetic architectures of modern cattle breeds,

it is interesting to note that the human genome has also
undergone selective adaptation for tolerance to lactose in
response to domestication of ruminants for milk production [9].
The cattle genome sequence fills an evolutionary void
among mammalian genome sequences as it is the first
complete high coverage genome sequence from the
Cetartiodactyl order of eutherian mammals which first
appeared ~60 million years ago when grasslands began to
cover large parts of the earth's surface. The order includes
~220 species of even-toed ungulate mammals (suborders
Ruminantia, Suina and Tylopoda), hippopotamus and 88
cetacean species (whales, dolphins and porpoises). The
Cetartiodactyla have adapted to an extraordinary diversity
of terrestrial and aquatic environments. Cattle are representative of the Ruminantia, a phylogenetically distant
clade to humans and rodents, the two most intensively
investigated mammalian species. The evolutionary relationships between these three mammalian groups are well
positioned to inform genome similarities and differences
in each group and comment on mammalian biology. The
evolution of genome organization, particularly the expansion and contraction of paralogous gene families and the
molecular bases for economically important adaptive
traits of ruminants such as lactation, metabolism, reproduction and disease resistance, are all important scientific
issues that can explicitly be addressed by comparative
analysis of the cattle genome with other mammalian
genomes.
The unique biology of ruminants was a predominant factor influencing the decision to sequence the cattle genome
[3]. Ruminants are characterized by their ability to convert
ingested complex plant carbohydrates into volatile fatty
acids such as acetate, propionate, butyrate, lactate and
valerate, which are then used as the major energy source
[10]. This remarkable fermentative transformation is performed by a complex community of symbiotic microorganisms present in the rumen. Microbial fermentation of
plant material is also the main source of dietary protein
and all B vitamins [10]. The immune system of cattle
appears to be exquisitely adapted to the extensive microbial communities that populate its gut and exposed epithelial surfaces. For example, up to 40% of peripheral
blood lymphocytes of cattle have γ/δ T-cell receptors as
compared to less than 1% in humans and rodents [11].
Thus, cattle are an excellent model species to study the
evolution and function of these enigmatic γ/δ T-cells,
which appear to play a major role in immune regulation
and suppression. Cattle are also used as models for
human reproductive biology and infectious diseases. The
latter application is also critical to maintaining a safe,
secure and healthy food supply. Assisted reproductive
technologies used by humans such as artificial insemina-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/193

tion, estrous synchronization, embryo transfer and in
vitro fertilization, were first developed for use in cattle.
Furthermore, cattle and other ruminants can be efficiently
cloned from adult somatic cells and therefore they represent excellent models to decipher the roles of epigenetic
modifications on development and differentiation of
stem cells [12].
The assembled 7.1× cattle genome sequence primarily
represents DNA from a single inbred female Hereford animal, L1 Dominette [1,13,14]. In addition, limited
sequence information was obtained from individuals representing six breeds, which allowed identification of putative SNP, a major resource for the HapMap Project which
used 34,470 of these in its analyses. The sequencing,
assembly, placement of sequence scaffolds on bovine
chromosomes and assessment of assembly quality were
assisted by a range of livestock research community
resources including radiation hybrid maps, chromosome
specific and whole genome linkage maps, physical maps
based on BAC end sequence information, extensive EST
collections and approximately 10,000 full length cDNA
sequences [1,13]. An independent high density linkage
map of the bovine genome is also reported [15]. The
Bovine Genome Sequencing and Analysis Consortium
and the Bovine HapMap Consortium used a variety of
genome wide computational approaches, comparative
genomics analyses and focused gene specific investigations to highlight the evolutionary history, unique biology and population diversity associated with modern
cattle.
What has the initial analysis of the bovine genome
sequence revealed? Evolutionary breakpoint regions in
mammalian chromosomes, which define the boundaries
of conserved syntenic blocks of sequence, are associated
with considerable evolutionary plasticity in mammals.
Large segmental duplications are over-represented and
some types of repetitive sequence elements are selectively
enriched or excluded in these regions [1,16]. Moreover,
the segmental duplications are enriched for genes whose
protein products often directly interface with the external
environment e.g. immune proteins and sensory receptors.
This observation suggests that these genes represent evolutionary adaptations to the immediate environment of cattle. Comparative analyses also revealed that sequences of
bovine proteins are generally more similar to human
orthologs than are rodent orthologs. There are also cattle
specific changes in the organization of genes involved in
digestion, immunity, reproduction and lactation [1].
Milk is exquisitely formulated to suit the differing developmental needs of newborn mammals. Analysis of the
genes encoding proteins present in bovine milk and the
genes expressed in mammary tissue during the lactation

cycle provide the first comprehensive overview of lactation genomics [17]. The integration of this information
with population genetic resources generated in the dairy
industry provides an enabling resource for future discovery of genes underpinning complex dairy production
traits. These analyses clearly indicate that milk is not just
a convenient source of high quality nutrients but it also
contains a variety of bioactive proteins which probably
play key roles in the antimicrobial defense system of the
newborn suckling calf and possibly also in gut maturation.
Several of the companion papers focused on changes in
the organization of specific gene families in the bovine
lineage and their potential impact on ruminant biology.
Compared with humans and rodents, there are significant
changes in the organization of several immune gene families [1] exemplified by the serum amyloid A3 [18] and
type 1 interferon [19] families, as well as the major histocompatability complex [20] and T cell receptor B locus
[21]. The extensive genomic rearrangements of these and
other immune gene families suggest that during evolution
of the bovine lineage there has been adaptation to changing infectious disease challenges [1]. There are also alterations in the organization of gene families involved in
reproduction compared with the human and rodent
genomes [22]. These probably reflect the distinctive reproductive program in cattle, particularly differences in placental structure. In addition, a number of genes are
implicated in various aspects of bovine reproductive function and early development [23,24].
Metabolic reconstruction analysis revealed that most
genes encoding metabolic enzymes are conserved in
mammals however in cattle a few gene losses compared
with other mammalian species were identified [25]. These
evolutionary changes may be important for understanding metabolic adaptations to the ruminant lifestyle. Examination of defined regions of chromosome 6 revealed a
number of novel transcripts [26] suggesting that the full
complement of transcriptional activity of the genome is
yet to be defined. This is a reminder of a major future challenge – the mapping of the complete repertoire of transcriptional activity across the genome.
The Bovine HapMap Consortium analysed the frequency
of over 37,000 SNP in 497 cattle from 19 geographically
and biologically diverse cattle breeds [2]. The resulting
hapmap is literally a map of the genetic diversity among
different cattle populations. Analysis of the hapmap
revealed a picture of cattle history in which the ancient
population size was relatively large but genetic diversity
was dramatically reduced by the processes of domestication and selective breeding [2]. Thus, while the overall
number of domesticated cattle has increased in parallel

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/193

with the expanding human population, the genetic diversity of those animals has decreased. Nevertheless, genetic
diversity among cattle remains greater than among dog
breeds and is similar to the diversity among humans [2].
In a companion report, the haplotype structures for several cattle breeds were determined at high resolution [27].
Other reports describe the use of population genetics to
investigate the origins and evolution of the different
breeds [28,29], effective population sizes [30] and signatures of positive selection associated with domestication
[31]. Another report highlights the potential for direct
industry application of population genetic information,
namely the association of variation of the Integrin Beta 5
gene with bull fertility [32]. A cattle QTL meta-analysis
was also performed to identify QTL confirmed in multiple
studies using different populations [33]. This analysis provides the scientific community with additional confidence
to pursue the identification of causal genetic polymorphisms underlying many complex production traits.
Another report describes the development and performance of a higher-density SNP assay that leveraged the
information gleaned from the HapMap Consortium
efforts [34].
Although these collective studies generated a multitude of
discoveries, this is only the beginning of a much larger
body of future research that will be catalyzed by the availability of the bovine genome sequence and haplotype
map. The genome sequence will be refined, reanalyzed
and integrated with biological data in ways we can not yet
imagine to examine fundamental questions relating to the
linkage between genes and cattle phenotypes, the reasons
for the evolutionary success of ruminants, the history of
cattle domestication, and the mechanisms of mammalian
evolution, to name but a few. The availability of very large
well managed cattle populations and sire based breeding
systems will accelerate the discovery of genes contributing
to complex traits of direct relevance to humans such as
energy partitioning, muscle formation, milk production
and disease resistance. Undoubtedly, the bovine genome
sequence and haplotype map will revolutionize the beef
and dairy industries by providing genetic and genomic
tools to help address the pivotal livestock issues of the 21st
century – efficient and sustainable production systems
with smaller environmental footprints.
