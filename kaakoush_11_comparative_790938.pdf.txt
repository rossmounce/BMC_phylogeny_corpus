Abstract
Background: Several studies have shown that significant genotypic heterogeneity exists among Campylobacter
concisus strains. Recently, the genome of C. concisus UNSWCD, isolated from a patient with Crohn’s disease, was
sequenced.
Results: In this study, comparative analyses were performed between strain UNSWCD and BAA-1457, isolated from
a patient with acute gastroenteritis. Searches between C. concisus UNSWCD and BAA-1457 showed that 76% of
genes were homologues, whereas those between C. jejuni strains showed 90-91% to be homologues, indicating
substantial variation exists within these two C. concisus genomes. More specific bidirectional homology searches
identified 1593 genes that are shared between these strains, and 115 and 281 genes unique to UNSWCD and BAA1457, respectively. Significantly, differences in the type of flagellin glycosylation pathways between the two strains
were identified and confirmed by PCR. The protein profiles of UNSWCD, BAA-1457 and a further six strains of C.
concisus were compared and analyzed bioinformatically, and this differentiated the strains into four clades. BAA1457 was found to be highly divergent (average similarity: 56.8%) from the other seven strains (mean average
similarity ± standard deviation: 64.7 ± 1.7%). Furthermore, searches for homologues of the 1593 proteins found to
be common between UNSWCD and BAA-1457 were conducted against all available bacterial genomes, and 18
proteins were found to be unique to C. concisus, of which 6 were predicted to be secreted, and may represent
good markers for detection of this species.
Conclusions: This study has elucidated several features that may be responsible for the heterogeneity that exists
among C. concisus strains, and has determined that the strain BAA-1457 is genetically atypical to other C. concisus
strains and is not a good candidate reference strain.

Background
Campylobacter concisus is a motile Gram-negative,
spiral/curved, bacterium that requires a microaerobic
hydrogen-enriched environment for growth [1]. Due to
its association with acute enteritis and Crohn’s disease
(CD) [2-11], C. concisus has been described as an

emergent pathogen of the human intestinal tract. However, the isolation of C. concisus from healthy individuals, and the failure of some studies to show a
significant difference in the prevalence of C. concisus in
subjects with diarrhea and healthy controls [4,5], has
resulted in controversy regarding the role of C. concisus
in intestinal disease.
Given that C. concisus has been reported to be genetically and taxonomically diverse with up to four or more
genomospecies being described [3,12,13], we recently

investigated the ability of a range of C. concisus strains
to attach to and invade human intestinal epithelial cell
lines using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) [14]. In
that study, the adherence and invasive abilities of C.
concisus UNSWCD, isolated from a CD patient, were
compared with that of C. concisus strains UNSWCS and
ATCC 51562 isolated from patients with acute gastroenteritis, and ATCC 51561 isolated from a healthy control.
Based on the SEM results, C. concisus UNSWCD
attached to and appeared to invade host cells [14].
While C. concisus strains from acute gastroenteritis or a
healthy control also displayed flagellum-mediated
attachment via microvilli, these strains did not appear to
invade [14]. Based on these findings, Man et al quantified the invasive ability of the four C. concisus strains
using gentamicin protection assays, and showed that the
percentage invasion of C. concisus UNSWCD was more
than 46- and 200-fold higher than that of C. concisus
UNSWCS and C. concisus ATCC 51562, respectively
[14]. Interestingly, C. concisus ATCC 51561 isolated
from a healthy subject, showed no evidence of invasion.
Man et al further investigated the invasion process of
C. concisus UNSWCD and found that host microtubules
and microfilaments were involved due to the attenuation
of invasion by inhibitors such as colchicine and cytochlasin D [14]. Interestingly, there is some consensus
that Campylobacter jejuni strains may also require both
microtubules and microfilaments during the invasion
process into different intestinal cell lines [15-17], a finding that would suggest that C. concisus UNSWCD may
use a similar mechanism of invasion to C. jejuni. Moreover, Man et al showed that C. concisus UNSWCD preferentially attached to intercellular junctional spaces and
that this spatial distribution was concomitantly associated with a loss of membrane-associated ZO-1 and
occludin [14].
As a result, Man et al postulated that the differences
observed in the pathogenic potential of the C. concisus
strains may be related to the genetic diversity among
them [14]. To investigate this hypothesis, we recently
sequenced the genome of C. concisus UNSWCD in
order to compare it with the only other available C. concisus genome BAA-1457 (also known as strain 13826), a
strain isolated from the feces of a patient with acute
gastroenteritis [18]. A draft genome was assembled
employing the de novo assemblers Velvet and Edena,
and the UNSWCD genome size was found to be smaller
(1.84 MB) when compared to its reference BAA-1457
counterpart (2.1 MB). Sequence comparisons to identify
orthologues, essential gene verification analysis, syntenic
association maps and proteomic validations by Orbitrap
tandem mass spectrometry (more than 70% of the proteome identified), revealed a highly accurate assembly
but one with significant differences to that of C. concisus

BAA-1457. For example, clusters of syntenically placed
genes in the C. concisus BAA-1457 genome were shown
to be absent in the C. concisus UNSWCD genome, and
thus, the functions associated with these genes are likely
to be absent in UNSWCD [18].
In the current study, we analyzed the genomic and
proteomic differences between C. concisus UNSWCD
and BAA-1457 in order to examine the heterogeneity
within this species and to identify putative factors
responsible for the increased pathogenesis of C. concisus
UNSWCD. Differences identified in the flagellin glycosylation of C. concisus UNSWCD and BAA-1457 were
then assessed in a further six C. concisus strains.

Results and Discussion
Degree of diversity within Campylobacter concisus

Phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA gene, internal
transcribed region sequence and 23S rRNA gene of C.
concisus UNSWCD and BAA-1457 have shown that
these bacteria cluster together when compared to other
Campylobacter species [19]. However, there remains
high genetic diversity between the different C. concisus
strains [3,12,13]. Studies have found that this species
comprises several molecular groups (genomospecies).
For example, Vandamme et al reported that fecal C.
concisus isolates exhibited only 42 to 50% DNA-DNA
hybridization values with strains of oral origin [13].
Further studies using pulsed field gel electrophoresis
[12] and protein profiling [3] found C. concisus to comprise at least two genomospecies, which were phenotypically indistinguishable, but genetically divergent [12].
More recently, Aabenhus et al analyzed the genotype of
62 C. concisus clinical isolates using amplified length
fragment polymorphism and showed that C. concisus
contained at least four distinct genomospecies [2].
The recent sequencing of a second C. concisus genome (strain UNSWCD) [18], along with the available
BAA-1457 genome provided us with the opportunity to
perform comparative analyses of these genomes in an
effort to identify differences among C. concisus strains.
To understand the extent of variability between the genomes of the two C. concisus strains, bidirectional homology searches were performed and the values compared
with that of searches between two pairs of the three C.
jejuni strains with sequenced and comprehensively validated genomes. When cutoff values of 70% identity plus
at least 85% gene length coverage were employed,
searches between C. concisus UNSWCD and BAA-1457
showed that 76% of proteins were homologues, whereas
those for C. jejuni NCTC 11168 and 81116 and NCTC
11168 and 81-176 showed 91% and 90% to be homologues, respectively. Calculation of the average percentage
identities for all homologues revealed that for C. concisus UNSWCD and BAA-1457 it was 96% whereas that

Kaakoush et al. Gut Pathogens 2011, 3:15
http://www.gutpathogens.com/content/3/1/15

for the two C. jejuni pairs was 98%. Overall these values
clearly indicate that even when compared to a phylogenetically related species, higher variation existed within
the C. concisus genomes.
Further analyses of the differences in gene content
across the genomes of C. concisus BAA-1457 and
UNSWCD and other Campylobacter species were performed employing the CGView webserver (Figure 1). As
expected, the genome with the highest homology to
BAA-1457 was that of UNSWCD. Of interest were eight
regions that were present in BAA-1457 yet were absent
in all the other Campylobacter species including C. concisus UNSWCD (Figure 1). This provided initial evidence that the higher variation observed between the
two C. concisus strains may be due to uncommon elements within the reference BAA-1457 strain.
More specific bidirectional homology searches for
genes with greater than 40% similarity between the genomes of UNSWCD and BAA-1457 were performed. In
addition, genes with 30-40% similarity were manually
verified using functional domain and gene ontology analyses. This identified 1593 genes that are shared between
these strains, representing a genome percentage similarity of 91.7% (1593/1738) for UNSWCD and 79.2%
(1593/2010) for BAA-1457. The searches also identified
a total of 115 (6.6%) and 281 (14.0%) genes unique to
UNSWCD and BAA-1457, respectively (Additional file
1, Table S1; Additional file 2, Table S2), with a further
30 and 136 genes that were not categorized into either
group due to insufficient information on these genes.
Genomic variations unique to Campylobacter concisus
BAA-1457

Of the 281 genes unique to BAA-1457 when compared
to UNSWCD, 111 proteins they encoded were at a level
of abundance within the cell that could be detected by
mass spectrometric analyses [18]. The finding that these
proteins were expressed when the bacterium was grown
under normal conditions would indicate that they play
an important role within the cell. The 281 genes
encoded proteins with a variety of functions, including
transport systems, energy metabolism and a secretion
system, as well as 130 hypothetical proteins. Of specific
interest was the identification of at least four proteins
involved in a Type VI secretion apparatus,
CCC13826_1177, CCC13826_1178, CCC13826_1182
and CCC13826_1188, all of which were expressed under
normal conditions (Additional file 1, Table S1). Type VI
secretion systems (T6SS) have been identified in many
bacterial pathogens including Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia pestis and Salmonella enterica, and have been implicated in the virulence of all of
these species [20]. Although T6SS are employed to
transport proteins across the bacterial envelope, more

Page 3 of 11

recently, a family of T6SS proteins have been found to
share structural features with the cell-puncturing device
of the T4 bacteriophage, and thus, may be used by the
bacterium to puncture host cell membranes and insert
the T6SS apparatus into the host cytosol [21].
Another protein of interest found within the unique
proteins of BAA-1457 was the zonula occludens toxin
(Zot). This protein and its possible functions within the
cell have been previously discussed by Kaakoush et al
[22]. Briefly, Zot is known to mimic a physiological
modulator of intercellular tight junctions [23], and is
used by virulent pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae and
Neisseria meningitidis to increase tissue permeability
[24]. The presence of Zot in BAA-1457 and its absence
in UNSWCD was confirmed by PCR (Figure 2A). The
presence of this gene in a further six strains of C. concisus (Table 1) was also investigated, and the toxin was
found to be absent in all six strains (Figure 2A) (results
were confirmed with the second primer pair ZotF/Zot2),
suggesting that it is an uncommon feature within the
genomes of C. concisus strains.
Genomic variations unique to Campylobacter
concisusUNSWCD

Due to the isolation of UNSWCD from a patient with
CD and its increased invasive potential as compared
with other C. concisus strains [14], the unique features
within this strain compared to BAA-1457 were of particular interest. The 115 genes unique to UNSWCD
encoded 37 proteins that were at a level of abundance
within the cell that could be detected by mass spectrometric analyses (Additional file 2, Table S2) [18]. They
comprised proteins with functions including transport,
oxidative stress and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as
88 hypothetical proteins. For example, a heat shock protein G homologue found to be involved in protection
against oxidative stress in several bacterial species
including Cyanobacteria was identified [25].
Several proteins involved in phage protection were
also identified, including a phage portal protein, and a
phage antirepressor protein. In addition, a modification
methylase and endonuclease were identified. Modification methylases are involved in restriction-modification
systems that are responsible for producing a speciescharacteristic methylation pattern in a short sequence in
the host cell’s DNA. Thus, any DNA from another species that gains entry into the cell and lacks the characteristic methylation pattern are recognized by restriction
endonucleases and destroyed by cleavage. In addition,
proteins involved in the processing of exogenous DNA
and DNA repair were found, namely a competence protein CoiA and a nucleotidyltransferase family protein.
While there are limited studies on the function of CoiA,
Desai and Morrison have reported that this protein

although not involved in uptake of donor DNA, is
involved in processing this DNA to make viable mutants
[26]. The presence of these proteins in UNSWCD may
suggest that this strain has a more adaptable nature that
may have lead to its increased efficiency in the host.
A further protein, an O-antigen ligase, that may play a
role in the aggregation and adherence of C. concisus
UNSWCD onto host cells, was also identified. This protein functions in the attachment of polymerized O-antigen repeat units to the lipid A core, and has been found
to be important for cell wall integrity and bacterial
motility [27]. More recently, Morgenstein et al found
that deactivation of the O-antigen ligase in Proteus mirabilis had little effect on its swimming motility in soft
agar but blocked its swarming motility on solid surfaces
[27]. Thus, this protein may aid C. concisus UNSWCD
to aggregate on host cells as has been observed previously by SEM [14].
Another protein of interest that was unique to C. concisus UNSWCD when compared to BAA-1457, and to
other members of the Campylobacterales, was the Acr

protein (a-crystallin). Interestingly, expanded searches
revealed that the gene encoding this protein is found in
the genomes of extreme ε-Proteobacteria such as Nautilia profundicola and Caminibacter mediatlanticus. In
addition, Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been shown to
have two members of the Acr family of molecular chaperones. For example, in 1998, Yuan et al demonstrated
that acr transcription and Acr expression were strongly
induced by hypoxic conditions and in vitro infection of
macrophages, respectively [28]. These authors hypothesized that this protein was important for long term viability and replication during initial M. tuberculosis
infections. More recently, Wilkinson et al determined
that two Acr proteins, Acr1 and Acr2, were present in
M. tuberculosis and were important for the bacterium’s
interaction with the host [29]. Acr1 has been shown to
be induced by exposure to hypoxia or nitric oxide and is
associated with bacterial persistence in a non-replicating
state, while Acr2 is induced by heat shock, oxidative
stress, and uptake by macrophages. In 2005, Stewart et
al demonstrated that both Acr proteins contribute to
persistent infection with M. tuberculosis, and suggested
that manipulation of acr expression can influence the
host response to infection [30]. More recently, Stewart
et al showed that deletion of the acr gene resulted in
infection of C57BL6 mice with bacillary loads 1-2 log
units higher than the wild-type strain [31]. In addition,
mice infected with the mutant strain showed high levels
of TNF-a, IFN-g and G-CSF in their serum, suggesting
that Acr may play a role in modulating the host
response to infection [31]. The presence of this protein
in UNSWCD and not in BAA-1457 or any other Campylobacterales further supports the invasive nature of
this C. concisus strain within the host.
Flagellin glycosylation in Campylobacter concisus

Like many Gram-negative bacteria with polar flagella,
Campylobacter flagellins are known to undergo glycosylation. Although pathway variations and sugar modifications exist among strains, most C. jejuni strains contain
genes for the synthesis of two sugars that link to flagellin: pseudaminic acid (PA) and an acetamidino form of

legionaminic acid (LA) [32-34]. The entire PA biosynthetic pathway has been characterized in Helicobacter
pylori and has been shown to involve six enzymes PseB,
PseC, PseH, PseG, PseI and PseF [35]. More recently,
the LA biosynthetic pathway was characterized in C.
jejuni and has also been shown to involve six enzymes,
namely LegB, LegC, LegH, LegG, LegI and LegF [36].
Bidirectional homology searches against the genomes
of UNSWCD and BAA-1457 revealed that UNSWCD
contained the PA biosynthetic pathway whereas BAA1457 contained the LA biosynthetic pathway. To
further confirm these findings, a phylogenetic analysis
was performed on the six proteins of each pathway for
several Campylobacterales (Figure 3). There was a distinct division between the two types of pathways, with
the PA and LA pathways clustering into separate
groups. Importantly, the six proteins from UNSWCD
clustered with the PA pathways whereas the six proteins from BAA-1457 clustered with the LA pathways,
confirming the homology searches. C. concisus BAA1457 was the only member of the Campylobacterales
to express only a LA biosynthetic pathway. Interestingly, the PA biosynthetic pathways of Campylobacter

species that contained both pathways within their genome clustered together, revealing an evolutionary closeness within the flagellin glycosylation pathways of
these bacteria.
The presence of these pathways were further verified
experimentally, where the presence of pseB in
UNSWCD (Figure 2B) and legB in BAA-1457 (Figure
2C) was confirmed by PCR. Six additional C. concisus
strains (Table 1) were also analyzed, and it was found
that they all contained the PA biosynthetic pathway
(Figure 2B, C). While currently the function of flagellin
glycosylation in Campylobacter spp. is not fully understood, perturbations in flagellin glycosylation systems of
Campylobacter spp. and H. pylori have been shown to
result in negative effects on filament assembly, autoagglutination, microcolony formation on intestinal epithelial cells, cyto-adherence and invasion [32]. Thus, it is
possible that differences in the flagellin glycosylation
pathways of C. concisus strains may be involved in the
variations seen in their adherence and invasive potential.
In addition, this provided further evidence that C. concisus BAA-1457 was genetically divergent from the other
C. concisus strains studied. Their similar genetic backgrounds and the presence of only a PA biosynthetic
pathway in the seven C. concisus strains and only a LA
biosynthetic pathway in BAA-1457 makes these bacteria
ideal organisms to study these flagellin glycosylation
pathways in more detail.

Protein profiles of Campylobacter concisus

The genomic variations between UNSWCD and BAA1457 led us to investigate the protein profiles of these
two strains and a further six C. concisus strains (Table
1) isolated from different disease states. The protein
profiles of the total cell lysates of the eight strains were
determined using SDS-PAGE, and analyzed using the
Phoretix 1D pro software, which clustered the strains
based on their banding patterns (Figure 4A, B). The
eight strains did not cluster according to the disease
state from which they were isolated. This is in line with
the findings of Engberg et al who reported that strainspecific differences in the ability of C. concisus to induce
cytolethal distending toxin-like effects on monkey kidney cells had no specific association with disease outcome [4]. Moreover, disease state was not a factor in
the hemolytic phospholipase A2 activity of C. concisus
strains isolated from children with diarrhea [37].
At a distance of 0.4 two clades were present, one containing BAA-1457 and the other all other seven strains
(Figure 4B). The average similarity of BAA-1457 with
the other seven strains was 56.8%, while the mean average similarity of the other seven strains was 64.7% with
a standard deviation of 1.7% (Table 2). This indicated
that BAA-1457 is highly divergent from the other C.

concisus strains, providing additional evidence that it is
atypical in nature. Interestingly, at a distance of 0.35,
three clades were present, one containing BAA-1457,
one containing ATCC 51561 isolated from a healthy
control and the third containing the other six strains.
Excluding the results of BAA-1457, the average similarity of ATCC 51561 with the six other strains was 63.2%,
while the average similarity of the six other strains ranged from 64.7-69.0% (mean average similarity of the six
other strains = 66.5 ± 1.7%) (Table 2), indicating that
the healthy control strain was divergent from the other
strains isolated from acute and chronic gastroenteritis
and CD. Finally, at a distance of 0.325 four clades were
present, where the previous third cluster comprising six
strains was split into two groups of three strains (group
1: UNSWCD, UNSW2 and ATCC 51562; group 2:
UNSW3, UNSW1 and UNSWCS). While this division
was not based on disease state, it may shed light on the
discrepancies in the results of previous studies differentiating C. concisus strains. That is, techniques with the
capacity of differentiating up to two C. concisus genomospecies may be observing what is seen at a distance

of 0.4, whereas those differentiating up to four molecular groups may be observing that seen at a distance of
0.325.
Possible markers for the identification of Campylobacter
concisus

Due to the large variability observed between C. concisus
strains UNSWCD and BAA-1457, proteins found in
both strains but not in another bacterial species may be
ideal markers for the detection of this species. Searches
for homologues of the 1593 proteins found to be common between the two strains were conducted against all
available bacterial genomes, and 18 proteins were found
to be unique to C. concisus, of which six were bioinformatically predicted to be secreted (Table 3). These were
made up of mostly short (~40-50 amino acids) hypothetical proteins. Of interest was CCC13826_2290 that was
160 amino acids in length and predicted to contain a
signal peptide (Table 3). Given that secreted or membrane proteins are more likely to illicit a host immune
response, these identified proteins make good targets for
species-specific detection through methods such as

ELISA. In addition, the low number of proteins unique
to these two strains further emphasizes the extent of
variability between them.
Validation of the presence of the six genes encoding
putative taxon-specific markers bioinformatically predicted to be secreted (Table 3) in the eight C. concisus
strains was performed using PCR and sequencing. Two
of the six genes (ccc13826_0334 and ccc13826_2290)
were present within all the eight C. concisus strains,
thus, providing evidence that they may be good taxonspecific markers for this bacterium. Further investigation, within more C. concisus strains, of the potential of
these genes to be taxon-specific markers is required.

Conclusions
This study has elucidated several features that may be
responsible for the heterogeneity that exists among C.
concisus strains, and has identified factors that may
explain the differences in their pathogenic potential.
The identification of different virulence factors (a-crystallin and zonula occludens toxin) within the two C.
concisus strains (UNSWCD and BAA-1457) as well as
the different types of flagellin glycosylation biosynthetic pathways (pseudaminic acid and legionaminic
acid) present interesting avenues to further investigate
the differences in pathogenesis of C. concisus strains.
Importantly, based on the current study, it would
appear that BAA-1457 is atypical to other C. concisus
strains, and thus, as a reference strain for sequence-

based analyses on this species, UNSWCD may represent a better candidate.

Methods
Comparative bioinformatic analyses

Homology searches were performed using the blastp and
blastn tools through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website available at (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) using the default settings. Comparative bioinformatic analyses on the genomes of C.
concisus strains UNSWCD and BAA-1457 were performed using the Blast2GO tool [38] available at (http://
www.blast2go.org/start_blast2go). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [39] available at
(http://www.genome.jp/kegg) was employed to determine the biochemical pathways to which genes were
assigned. Circular genome visualization was performed
using the CGView web-server [40]. Phylogenetic trees
on the glycosylation pathways within Campylobacterales
were performed at the Mobyle@Pasteur portal available
at (http://mobyle.pasteur.fr/cgi-bin/portal.py#welcome)
using the default settings. Trees were visualized using
the TreeView software available at (http://taxonomy.
zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html). The presence and
location of signal peptide cleavage sites in the amino
acid sequences were predicted using the default settings
for Gram-negative bacteria on the SignalP Server 3.0
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/). Non-classically secreted proteins were predicted using the

SecretomeP 2.0 Server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/
SecretomeP/).
Bacterial cultures

Campylobacter concisus strains UNSWCD [11],
UNSW1, UNSW2, UNSW3 [Kaakoush et al, unpublished data], ATCC 51561 [13], ATCC 51562 [13],
UNSWCS [14] and BAA-1457 [41] (Table 1) were
grown on Horse Blood agar (HBA) supplemented with
6% defibrinated horse blood. Cultures were incubated at
37°C under microaerobic conditions generated using
Campylobacter Gas Generating Kits BR0056A (Oxoid).
The purity of bacterial cultures was confirmed by motility and morphology observed under phase contrast
microscopy. Strains were selected based on the diagnosis
of the patient they were isolated from because of the
observed differences in the pathogenic potential of
strains isolated from chronic intestinal diseases and
acute intestinal diseases ([14], Kaakoush et al, unpublished data).
Extraction of genomic DNA, polymerase chain reactions
and sequencing

DNA extraction was performed using the Puregene Core
Kit A (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration and quality of DNA was measured using a Nanodrop ND-1000 Spectophotometer
(Nanodrop Technologies). PCR reactions were performed on the DNA extracted from the C. concisus
strains. The Zot PCRs were performed using the primer
pair Zot1 (GCAACTTAGAAAAAGTATCGG) and Zot2
(TAATAGTTCTCGATGAAGCC), which amplify a 979
bp region, and the primer pair ZotF (CTAGAATCAGTTTGTGGAGAT) and Zot2, which amplify a 790
bp region. The pseB PCR was performed using the primer pair pseB-F (CTAGTTATCTACTCACGCGAC)
and pseB-R (GGATAGACGGACTAATAACG), which
amplifies a 754 bp region. The legB PCR was performed
using the primer pair legB-F (TAGTTATAGGTGCAGCAGGCT) and legB-R (GCATCATCTGCACTATATGGT), which amplifies a 817 bp region. The
thermal cycling conditions for all three reactions were:
94°C for 5 min, 30 cycles of 94°C for 20 s, 53°C for 20 s,
and 72°C for 1 min, followed by 72°C for 5 min.
To validate possible taxon-specific markers six primer
pairs targeting the genes ccc13826_0311, ccc13826_0334,
ccc13826_0423, ccc13826_0909, ccc13826_1918 and
ccc13826_2290 were designed. The ccc13826_0311 PCR
was performed using the primer pair 0311F (GAGGTTAGAAATAACAACAGC) and 0311R (TTGCTTGT
TCTCATCGTCGTA), which amplify a 226 bp region.
The ccc13826_0334 PCR was performed using the primer pair 0334F (GAGTGATGATTTTGACTACG) and
0334R (CGAGTCGTAACTATCCTCATC), which

Page 9 of 11

amplify a 151 bp region. The ccc13826_0423 PCR was
performed using the primer pair 0423F (GAAGCATCTAAGCCTGACAGA) and 0423R (ACTCTGCAAACTGACACCAAG), which amplify a 240 bp region. The
ccc13826_0909 PCR was performed using the primer
pair 0909F (GTTAACATAGCTTTGGCAAGG) and
0909R (GCTGTTTTGCGT AAATTTGTG), which
amplify a 98 bp region. The ccc13826_1918 PCR was
performed using the primer pair 1918F (GTGCTTAACAAAAGATGTGGC) and 1918R (GCTGTTTTGCG
TAAATTTGTG), which amplify a 114 bp region. The
ccc13826_2290 PCR was performed using the primer
pair 2290F (GAGAGTTTTAGATTTGATGG) and
2290R (CTCATACGAAAGCATCAAGAC), which
amplify a 309 bp region. The thermal cycling conditions
for all six reactions were: 94°C for 5 min, 30 cycles of
94°C for 20 s, 50°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 20 s, followed
by 72°C for 5 min.
To confirm the identities of the products, they were
first purified using the QIAquick® PCR Purification Kit
(Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Subsequently, sequencing of the positive PCR products was
undertaken using the BigDye™ terminator chemistry
(Applied Biosystems). Sequences were resolved on an
Automated DNA Sequence Analyser ABI3730 (Applied
Biosystems) at the sequencing facility of the School of
Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, The University
of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. Products were
confirmed using blastn searches available through NCBI.
SDS-PAGE

Campylobacter concisus strains were grown on HBA
plates, and bacteria were washed twice in phosphate buffered saline. Following the final wash, packed cells were
resuspended in 1 ml TSU buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0,
0.1% SDS, 2.5 M urea) and lysed by two freeze-thaw cycles
in liquid nitrogen. Lysate proteins (20 μg) were resuspended in 1:1 SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.375 M Tris pH
6.8, 0.01% SDS, 20% glycerol, 40 mg ml-1 SDS, 31 mg ml-1
DTT, 1 μg ml-1 bromophenol blue). For electrophoretic
analyses proteins were further denatured by heating at 95°
C for 5 min. Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE
gels by electrophoresis for 1.5 h at 100 V. Gels were
stained using Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Bio-Rad).
Phoretix 1D pro software (TotalLab Ltd.; Newcastle Upon
Tyne, NE, UK) was employed to determine the percentage
similarities between the protein profiles of the C. concisus
strains, and to cluster the lanes based on banding patterns.
