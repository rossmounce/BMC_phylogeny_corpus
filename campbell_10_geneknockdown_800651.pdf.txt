Gene-knockdown in the honey bee mite Varroa
destructor by a non-invasive approach: studies on
a glutathione S-transferase
Ewan M Campbell1, Giles E Budge2, Alan S Bowman1*

Abstract
Background: The parasitic mite Varroa destructor is considered the major pest of the European honey bee (Apis
mellifera) and responsible for declines in honey bee populations worldwide. Exploiting the full potential of gene
sequences becoming available for V. destructor requires adaptation of modern molecular biology approaches to
this non-model organism. Using a mu-class glutathione S-transferase (VdGST-mu1) as a candidate gene we
investigated the feasibility of gene knockdown in V. destructor by double-stranded RNA-interference (dsRNAi).
Results: Intra-haemocoelic injection of dsRNA-VdGST-mu1 resulted in 97% reduction in VdGST-mu1 transcript levels
48 h post-injection compared to mites injected with a bolus of irrelevant dsRNA (LacZ). This gene suppression was
maintained to, at least, 72 h. Total GST catalytic activity was reduced by 54% in VdGST-mu1 gene knockdown mites
demonstrating the knockdown was effective at the translation step as well as the transcription steps. Although
near total gene knockdown was achieved by intra-haemocoelic injection, only half of such treated mites survived
this traumatic method of dsRNA administration and less invasive methods were assessed. V. destructor immersed
overnight in 0.9% NaCl solution containing dsRNA exhibited excellent reduction in VdGST-mu1 transcript levels
(87% compared to mites immersed in dsRNA-LacZ). Importantly, mites undergoing the immersion approach had
greatly improved survival (75-80%) over 72 h, approaching that of mites not undergoing any treatment.
Conclusions: Our findings on V. destructor are the first report of gene knockdown in any mite species and
demonstrate that the small size of such organisms is not a major impediment to applying gene knockdown
approaches to the study of such parasitic pests. The immersion in dsRNA solution method provides an easy,
inexpensive, relatively high throughput method of gene silencing suitable for studies in V. destructor, other small
mites and immature stages of ticks.

Background
The European honey bee, Apis mellifera, is vital to the
pollination of agricultural and wild plants [1]. There is
widespread concern about the worldwide decline in the
abundance of A. mellifera [2]. The ectoparasitic Varroa
mite (Varroa destructor) is the most important pest of
A. mellifera and plays a central role to honey bee losses
[3]. V. destructor originally parasitized the Asian bee
(A. cerana) where it nearly exclusively parasitized the
male bees (drones), thus making little impact on the bee
colony. However, in the 1950’s V. destructor shifted to

the European honey bee (A. mellifera) upon which it
parasitizes both the drones and female bees (workers).
This shift in parasitized caste is significant because the
workers make up the bulk of the adult bee population
within a colony [4]. V. destructor entered mainland Europe in the 1970’s, the USA in 1987 and the UK in 1992
and subsequently has been associated with the loss of
millions of colonies [3]. The mite causes damage by
feeding on the haemolymph of both the developing bee
within brood cells and the adult bee. Mites also transmit
a variety of pathogens, most notably deformed wing
virus. In terms of both the number of enterprises
affected and the impact of global food production, varroasis is arguably the most serious disease of livestock
in any species. Previous control of V. destructor by

chemical treatment is increasingly ineffective due to the
development of widespread resistance in mites to the
limited available acaricides [5].
There is an urgent need to harness modern molecular
techniques for research into the biology and, ultimately,
the control of this non-model organism, V. destructor.
RNA interference (RNAi) is a gene silencing technique
that is becoming an ever more powerful tool in investigating the functional role of specific genes that may be
potential targets for chemotherapeutic intervention. The
RNAi mechanism involves the in vivo production of
small interfering RNA molecules (siRNAs) from larger
introduced double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). siRNA
molecules target and destroy specific mRNA, silencing
the target gene at the post-transcriptional stage. RNAi
has been used successfully to investigate genes in a
range of invertebrate species to date including gut proteins in tsetse flies [6]; moulting genes in Tribolium castaneum [7], aquaporins in aphids [8], a putative
prostaglandin E synthase in sealice [9] and extensively in
ticks (reviewed in [10]). In most cases, administration of
dsRNA to the invertebrate target is achieved by intrahaemocoelic injection, though immersion in solutions
containing the dsRNA has been employed for nematodes and sea lice.
In this study, we assessed the feasibility of gene
knockdown in V. destructor using dsRNA and determined the speed and persistence of the gene knockdown
effect. Additionally, we examined less invasive methods
of dsRNA administration to increase ease of experimentation and improve mite survivability. The chosen target
gene was a glutathione S-transferase of the mu class.
GSTs were selected for study as they have been implicated in acaricide resistance in ticks [11,12] and scabies
mites [13,14] and were readily amenable to activity
assays to assess the effect of gene knockdown at the
translational step.

and substrate binding sites. Notably, the mu loop in
VdGST-mu1 was considerably different compared to
other acarine muGSTs.
Following alignment of the mite, tick and insect
sequences, but before phyogenetic trees were constructed, the sequences were truncated by approximately
27 amino acids corresponding to those missing at the
N-terminus in VdGST-mu1. Neighbour-joining, minimum evolution and maximum parsimony methods gave
trees with similar topology and approximate bootstrap
values and so only the neighbour-joining tree is presented. The acarine muGSTs clearly separated from the
most similar insect GSTs (Figure 2). Within the acarine
muGSTs, ticks and mites branched into different clades.
Suprisingly, the VdGST-mu1 did not branch with the
mite clade, but rather were located in a clade containing
tick muGSTs. Concordantly, VdGST-mu1 shared a
higher amino acid homology with ticks (e.g. Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, [GenBank: AY298732.1], 58% identity; Ixodes scapularis, [GenBank: XM_0024017051.1],
45% identity) than with mite muGSTs (e.g. Sarcoptes
scabei hominis, [GenBank: AF462190.1], 38% identity;
Dermatphagoides pteronyssimus, [GenBank: AY825938],
35% identity).
Tissue distribution of three V. destructor GSTs

RT-PCR analysis of the three cloned GSTs demonstrated marked differences in both their abundances and
tissue distributions (Figure 3). VdGST-mu1 seemed to
be an abundantly expressed gene that was expressed at
a similar level in all three dissected tissues examined,
namely synganglia, Malpighian tubules and the gut. In
contrast, VdGST-mu2 is a less abundantly expressed
gene that was clearly expressed in the synganglion and
Malpighian tubules, but expressed at a much lower level
in gut tissue. VdGST-kap was by far the least abundantly expressed of the GSTs studied, with a slightly
higher level in the Malpighian tubules than the synganglion or gut.

Bioinformatics and phylogeny

Of the three putative Varroa GSTs, two belonged to the
mu class and the other to the kappa GST class. The largest PCR product sequenced (563 bp) was termed
VdGST-mu1 and the sequence deposited to EMBL
[Accession No.: FR668088]. VdGST-mu1 was 100%
identical to the sequence (639 bp) from a pyrosequencing project on V. destructor from the USA (Dr. Jay
Evans, pers. comm.). Alignment of the protein sequence
of VdGST-mu1 (213 amino acids) with other muGSTs
from a variety of acari indicated that although it constituted 88% of the estimated open-reading frame, about
27 amino acids from the N-terminus were missing
(Figure 1). Motifs characteristic of muGSTs were present in VdGST-mu1 as well as conserved glutathione

Effectiveness and persistence of VdGST-mu1 knockdown
in V. destructor

dsRNA was administered to V. destructor by intrahaemocoelic injection with a 20 nl bolus in distilled water
and the mites then allowed to feed on bee larvae. The
transcript level of VdGST-mu1 was monitored by RTPCR at various time points over the following 3 days
(Figure 4). No effect was observed at 18 or 24 hr after
the dsRNA injection, but by 48 hr dsVdGST-mu1
injected mites had a 30-fold decrease of VdGST-mu1
mRNA compared to dsLacZ injected mites (P < 0.001,
Figure 4B), that represented an almost total knockdown
of the target transcript and which was uniform across
the three individual mites tested. By 72 h, the effect of

the RNAi treatment at the transcript level was still
present (P < 0.001).
Effectiveness and mortality rates of different routes of
dsRNA administration

Though microinjection of dsRNA had very effectively
knocked down VdGST-mu1 mRNA levels (96 ± 3.7%, n
= 4, Figure 4B), such injection techniques were laborious, required specialised equipment and led to high
mortality rates in the mites (50% survival, n = 62).
Alternative, less invasive approaches to dsRNA administration were assessed (Table 1). A 1 μl droplet of 0.2%
Triton-X100 (v/v) placed on mites immobilised on adhesive tape rapidly killed the mites (n = 6), whereas a 1 μl
droplet of dsRNA in plain water had no mortality (100%
survival, n = 14), but was totally ineffective in reducing
VdGST-mu1 transcript levels. Mites completely submerged in 0.2% Triton-X100 died very quickly (n = 15),

whereas mites submerged in water died within a few
hours (n = 15). Increasing the osmolality of the soaking
solution by using 0.9% saline greatly increased survival
of mites (72% survival, n = 26) submerged for 14 h at
4°C and then placed on bee pupae for a further 48 hr.
This method effectively knocked down VdGST-mu1
mRNA (87 ± 0.7%, n = 3; Figure 5). It should be noted
that mites removed from brood cells and placed on bee
pupae in Petri dishes but receiving no treatment at all,
typically exhibited survival from 75 - 90% over a 48 hr
period.
Phenotype of VdGST-mu1 knockdown mites

To determine that the knockdown effect of treatment with
either dsRNA-lacZ or dsRNA-VdGST-mu1 was not simply just at the mRNA (transcriptional) level, but was also
carried through to the protein (translational) level, we
assessed total GST catalytic activity in mites (Figure 6).

rendering them water soluble, less toxic products that
can be rapidly excreted from the organism’s body. As
such, GSTs play an important role in phase II detoxification of both endogenous and xenobiotic compounds
such as pesticides. Specifically, GSTs have been shown
to be involved in acaricide resistance in ticks [11,12],
scabies mites [13,14] and plant mites [16]. In the present
study we demonstrated the presence and tissue expression of two mu- and one kappa-class GST in V. destructor. The largest sequence fragment termed, VdGST-mu1
was 100% identical to the sequence present in an
ongoing pyrosequencing project (Dr. Jay Evans, personal
comm.) performed on V. destructor samples from the
USA. VdGST-mu1 was present in all mite tissues
assessed and was, by far, the most abundant of the three
GSTs examined. VdGST-mu1 contained conserved glutathione and substrate binding residues and motifs characteristic of mu-class GSTs. However, both the mu-loop
and SNAIL/TRAIL motifs were notably different from
those of other acarine muGSTs. Interestingly, VdGSTmu1 was more similar to tick muGSTs than that of
mites.
VdGST-mu1 was used as a test gene to assess the feasibility of dsRNAi gene knockdown in V. destructor.
Essentially total suppression of VdGST-mu1 expression
was achieved within 48 h after an intrahaemocoelic

bolus injection of dsRNA and this suppression was
maintained until at least 72 h. RNAi by injected dsRNA
is an extensively employed approach for research in
ticks (reviewed in [10]) and total gene knockdown can
be maintained for up to, at least, 9 days [17]. However,
V. destructor are considerably smaller (1 mm length ×
1.5 mm width) than adult ticks and injection was only
possible by pulled-glass capillary needles connected to a
relatively sophisticated micro-injector system, rather
than using manually operated micro-syringes as is
the case for ticks and most insects. Even though the

micro-injector system allowed us to demonstrate effective dsRNAi in V. destructor, survival of mites undergoing this very invasive and traumatic procedure was
only 50% over a 48 h period.
Various less invasive techniques of introducing dsRNA
into V. destructor were investigated that would improve
speed, ease of operation, increase throughput, could be
performed without expensive equipment and, most
importantly, increase survivability of the treated groups.
Topically applied dsRNA to immobilized mites for several hours failed to induce gene knockdown, presumably

because the dsRNA was unable to cross the cuticle. We
tried the addition of the detergent Triton X-100 to
break the surface tension of the water allowing the
dsRNA solution to become more in contact with the
cuticle rather than held off it by the fine hair layer
(Figure 7). However, Triton X-100 caused rapid death of
the mites. Next we assessed total immersion of mites as
a possible route for dsRNA administration as was previously successfully performed with salmon lice in seawater [9]. Mites immersed in 0.2% Triton X-100 died
rapidly and, surprisingly, mites in distilled water died
within a few hours. We postulated that the hypo-osmolarity of the distilled water caused an osmotic influx of
water into the mite tissues and this was exacerbated in

survival and achieved excellent gene silencing. It is not
known what is the site of dsRNA entry into the mite,
but this is of considerable interest and importance. We
presumed entry to be either by ingestion or though the
tracheal system via the spiracles. Adult female
V. destructor enter the prepupal cells 24 - 48 h before
the cell is capped and they remain hidden from vigilant
nurse bees by submerging themselves in the liquid
brood food [18] with the peritremes surrounding the
spiracles protruding from the liquid enabling the mites
to breathe [19,20]. It may be possible to improve survivability and, possibly increase gene knockdown efficacy,
if the osmolality of the immersion solution were
increased to that of liquid brood food that is presumed
to be greater than that of physiological saline (0.9%
NaCl). Indeed, further optimisation of this approach
could be attempted, if thought necessary, by altering
immersion temperature and time, but the method presented here is a good starting point.
Not only was gene knockdown achieved at the transcriptional step (mRNA) but this was also apparent at
the translational step (protein) with decreased GST catalytic activity. The apparent discrepancy between a 97%
reduction in VdGST-mu1 transcript level and the 54%
reduction in GST enzyme activity is because the enzyme
assay detects total GST activity not just that contributed
by VdGST-mu1. There have been reports of so-called
“off-target” effects of RNAi whereby unintended genes
sharing stretches of identical homology can be affected.
A meta-analysis of dsRNAi studies in Drosophila highthroughput screens indicated that dsRNAs containing
≥ 19 nucleotide perfect matches to unintended targets
can, in some instances, result in off-target effects [21].
In the case of VdGST-mu1, the most similar gene we
know of in Varroa is VdGST-mu2 [EMBL Accession
No.: FR675857] which shares 29% identity at the nucleotide level, but the greatest matching stretch possible is
one of 12/19 nucleotides (Figure 8). Thus, it is likely
that the reduction in assayable total GST activity is due
to a specific knockdown of VdGST-mu1, but further
studies would be necessary to confirm this. Our data
would indicate that VdGST-mu1 is the predominant
catalytic GST in V. destructor and highlights the specificity advantage of gene knockdown over chemical
enzyme inhibitors which simultaneously affect multiple
gene products.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have established dsRNA knockdown
in the critically important bee parasite, V. destructor,
using a mu-class GST as the candidate gene. A simple,
inexpensive, high throughput method of dsRNA administration was established with low mortality rates for
V. destructor. This immersion approach may be applied

to other small acarine pests such as scabies mites, sheep
scab mites, poultry mites and plant pest mites. Additionally, the approach can be employed in ticks where
the immersion approach is more convenient than injections for adult ticks but can also be applied to the smaller larval and nymphal stages which are presently not
included in such gene knockdown studies. The degree
of knockdown was essentially complete and persisted for
several days and was apparent at both the transcript and
protein level. The dsRNAi approach will allow researchers to make full use of the V. destructor gene sequences
becoming available to investigate biological questions in
this important parasite, notably to develop control strategies in the era when current suitable acaricides are no
longer effective due to widespread resistance. Peculiarly
to Varroa, because of the relatively close relatedness
between the parasite and host (Varroa and bee) it is
especially difficult to develop pesticides effective against
the Varroa, but innocuous to the bee. In this respect,
the specificity of dsRNAi may allow targeting of
V. destructor genes as a control strategy, as suggested
for other insect pests [22].

Methods
Mite collection and husbandry

Varroa destructor mites were collected from capped
brood cells of Apis mellifera from hives in York, England that had purposefully been untreated for Varroa
control. Prior to harvesting mites, the bee frames were
maintained in Aberdeen at 27ºC and 40% relative
humidity with a 15.5 h : 8.5 h, light:dark regime. Mites
were either removed from newly emerged adult bees or
from pupae following uncapping of the brood cell and
extraction of the pupae. Mites were collected, bisected
and placed in RNA ZR extraction buffer (Zymo
Research, Orange, California, USA) and stored at -80 ºC
prior to initial total RNA isolation.
RT-PCR of GSTs from V. destructor

Six adult (pharate and mobile) and 2 deutonymph mites
were homogenized in 600 μl extraction buffer and total
RNA prepared using a mini RNA Isolation II Kit (Zymo
Research), as per manufacturer’s instructions. Eluted
RNA was co-precipitated with glycogen in 95% ethanol
and resuspended in 10 μl of DEPC-treated water. After
isolation, 2 μg total RNA was DNase treated with 2 μl
(2U) RQ1-DNase (Promega, Southampton, UK) and 2 μl
RQ1 buffer and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. DNasetreated total RNA (2 μg) was incubated at 70°C with 0.5
μg of oligo d(T)15 (Promega) in a total volume of 10 μl
for 5 min. Material was snap-chilled on ice for 5 min
prior to the addition of 5 μl 5×RT buffer, 1 μl dNTPs
(25 mM each), 0.5 μl Bioscript-reverse transcriptase and
DEPC water to 25 μl. The reaction was incubated at

42°C for 60 min prior to arrest by heating to 70°C for
5 min.
A V. destructor database from an ongoing pyrosequencing project (Dr. Jay Evans, pers. comm.) was mined for
putative V. destructor GST sequences by BLASTx analysis using GST sequences from the deer tick, Ixodes scapularis. Of 14 putative V. destructor GST partial
sequences identified, we chose three to evaluate further:
two mu-class GSTs (VdGST-mu1 and VdGST-mu2) and
one kappa class (VdGST-kap). These Varroa transcripts
were isolated by RT-PCR using primers based on these
sequences. PCR reactions consisted of 1 μl cDNA template, 5 μl 10 × reaction buffer, 2 μl 50 mM MgCl2, 1 μl
dNTPs (25 mM each), 1 μl each primer (10 mM each),
0.5 μl (1.25 U) Taq (Bioline, London,UK) and DEPCtreated water to give a 50 μl total volume. Primer pairs
used were VdGST-mu-F1 (CAAGTTAAATCTTGC
GTTTCC) and VdGST-mu1-R1 (CTGTCCGTCTT
CATGTATGC), VdGST-mu2-F1 (ACGATTTATCCGT
TTTGACG) and VdGST-mu2-R2 (CCAACTGATGT
GTCGTTCC), VdGST-Kap-F1 (TACTGGTGGT
CGTTTCAGG) and VdGST-Kap-R1 (CTTCATAGGCCAAGAGATGC), generating products of 494, 396 and
343 bp, respectively. PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 1 cycle of 5 min at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of
1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 53°C and 45 s at 72°C followed
by a final extension time of 15 min at 72°C. Products
were visualised on an agarose gel and specific bands
excised and cloned into pCR4-TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen). Purified plasmids were submitted for sequencing to Eurofins MWG (Ebersberg, Germany) from
flanking T7 and T3 promoter regions to confirm the
original sequence data.
Bioinformatics

The GST class of the different Varroa sequences was
determined by database searches and phylogenetic analysis. For VdGST-mu1, protein sequences from various
acari were extracted from both non-redundant and EST

databases at GenBank by tBLASTx. Additionally, the
most similar GST sequences in four model insect species for which complete genomes are available were also
obtained. Protein sequences were aligned in CLUSTALW2 [23]. These sequences were used to estimate
phylogeny with neighbour-joining, minimum evolution
and maximum parsimony methods using MEGA version
4.1 [24]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with
10,000 bootstrap replicates.
Expression of GST transcripts in tissues of V. destructor

V. destructor mites, were removed from brood cells, as
described above, and dissected under ice-cold dissection
buffer (20 mM TRIS, 5 mM EDTA, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4).
Malpighian tubules, gut and synganglia and were dissected from 20, 25 and 98 mites respectively, washed in
fresh ice-cold dissection buffer and stored in 50 μl
RNAlater (Sigma, Poole, UK) at -80 °C. Prior to RNA
extraction, an additional 450 μl dissection buffer was
added to sample tubes and centrifuged at 10,000 g for
15 min at 4°C. Supernatant was removed and tissue
washed with fresh dissection buffer before a final spin at
10,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. Supernatant was discarded
and 600 μl RNA ZR extraction buffer added to each tissue sample. Total RNA extraction, DNase treatment and
reverse transcription were as described above. VdGSTmu1, VdGST-mu2 and VdGST-kap transcripts in tissuespecific cDNA were assayed by PCR. PCR protocol and
cycling conditions were carried out using the VdGSTmu1, VdGST-mu2 and VdGST-kap primers, as
described above over 30 cycles. Gel loading was normalized to V. destructor actin (VdActinF, CATCACCATTGGTAACGAG and VdActinR, CGATCCAG
ACGGAATACTT) generating a fragment of approximately 195 bp.
Preparation of dsRNA

VdGST-mu1-dsRNA was prepared using a BLOCK-iT
RNAi TOPO transcription kit (Invitrogen), according to

Campbell et al. Parasites & Vectors 2010, 3:73
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/3/1/73

the manufacturer’s instructions. LacZ-dsRNA was prepared and used as a negative control. Briefly, PCR was
carried out as described above using adult female
V. destructor cDNA in conjunction with VdGST-mu1
specific primers (VdGST-mu1 F1/R1), or with control
LacZ-plasmid and LacZ specific primers (LacZ-F2,
ACCAGAAGCGGTGCCGGAAA and LacZ-R2, CCACAGCGGTGGTTCGGAT). Products were resolved on
an agarose gel, excised and purified using a Qiagen gel
extraction kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). TOPO-T7 linker
was ligated to VdGST-mu1 and LacZ reactions before a
secondary PCR was carried out to gain sense and antisense templates. T7-RNA polymerase was used in transcription reactions with target templates to generate
sense and antisense RNA. Finally, RNA strands were
annealed and the resultant dsRNA purified and quantified in a micro-spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technology Ltd). dsRNA was ethanol precipitated and
resuspended in DEPC-treated water to a working concentration of 2.5 μg/μl and stored at -80°C.

either nothing, 0.9% NaCl, 0.2% Triton-X100 or both on
the ventral carapace. Mortality was monitored for 48 h
prior to collection and validation of knockdown.
Validation of RNAi

To validate RNAi in injected, soaked and dropletexposed adults, the total RNA was extracted from individual mites 48 h post-treatment. In addition, persistence of the RNAi effect was measured in injected mites
by harvesting at 18, 24, 48 and 72 h. Total RNA was
extracted from mites using mini-RNA isolation kit II,
prior to DNase-treatment and reverse transcription, as
described previously. PCR was carried out using either
VdGST-mu1-dsRNA or LacZ-dsRNA treated sample
cDNA in conjunction with primers specific for actin or
VdGST-mu1 using primers and cycling conditions, as
described above. Products were visualized on an agarose
gel normalized to actin loading. To assess persistence
and approximate % knockdown, ImageJ software was
used to carry out semi-quantitative densitometric analysis on gel images.

Protocol of dsRNA injection and soaking

Adult female V. destructor were removed from capped
brood cells along with associated bee larvae. Microinjections were carried out using pulled glass capillary needles in conjunction with a Harvard micro-injector
system. Mites were placed on double-sided tape ventral
side up, and injected with 20 nl (2.5 μg/μl) of either
VdGST-mu1-dsRNA or LacZ-dsRNA in either the soft
tissue proximal to the anal region and postcoxal plate,
or in the coxa IV region, as indicated in Figure 7. Needles were left in each mite for 1 - 2 min to reduce the
expulsion of fluid from the wound and withdrawn
slowly. Mites were left for 1 - 2 min to allow the injection site to “seal” then returned to Petri dishes containing 1 bee larvae per 4 mites. Dead or unhealthy looking
mites were removed after 1 hour and mortality was
monitored over 72 h in LacZ-dsRNA, VdGSTmu1dsRNA and non-injected mites.
To assess non-invasive techniques for dsRNA delivery,
mites were either completely immersed in dsRNA or
were exposed to a droplet of dsRNA on their ventral
carapace. For soaking experiments, adult mites were
removed from capped brood cells and placed in 500 μl
microfuge tubes containing 20 μl VdGST-mu1-dsRNA
or LacZ-dsRNA (2.5 μg/μl) supplemented with either
nothing, 0.9% NaCl, 0.2% Triton-X100 or both. Mites
were soaked at 4ºC overnight before being removed,
dried and placed in Petri dishes at 27ºC, 95% relative
humidity with bee larvae. Alternatively, a sample of
mites was exposed to dsRNA by attaching them to double-sided tape and placing a 1 μl drop of VdGST-mu1dsRNA or LacZ-dsRNA (2.5 μl/μg) supplemented with

Glutathione S-transferase activity in RNAi silenced mites

An enzymatic assay was used to assess the effect of
silencing VdGST-mu1 transcript on GST enzyme activity in dsRNA-treated mites. GST activity was measured
by using monochlorobimane (MCB) as the substrate, as
previously described for scabies mites [25] and plant
mites [26], but here we adapted it for cuvettes rather
than microplates. MCB forms a stable fluorescent conjugate with reduced glutathione when catalyzed with GST.
Mites injected with LacZ-dsRNA or VdGST-mu1dsRNA were harvested 48 h post-treatment and frozen
at -80ºC. Mites were grouped into pairs and homogenized by milling 2 × 30 s, with a single 3 mm tungsten
bead in 175 μl of ice cold 0.05 M Tris buffer pH7.5 in a
mechanical tissue disruptor (TissueLyser, Qiagen). After
milling, samples were disrupted further in a sonicating
water bath for 3 × 20 s with chilling in between bursts
then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 min at 4ºC. The
supernatant was retained, subjected to three freeze
thaw-cycles and sonicated for a further 2 × 20 s. Samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 min at 4ºC
and 150 μl of supernatant from each sample used in the
GST assay. Reduced glutathione was dissolved in 0.05 M
Tris pH 7.5 and MCB dissolved in methanol and added
to each reaction to a final concentration of 3 mM and
0.3 mM, respectively, in a total reaction volume of
200 μl. Mite homogenate and substrate were incubated
at 37ºC for 10 min with fluorescence of GSH-bimane
adduct measured every 2 s using a F4500 fluorimeter
(Hitachi) with emission wavelength at 465 nm and excitation wavelength at 390 nm. All results presented were

corrected for non-enzymatic fluorescence obtained from
samples substituting 150 μl 0.05 M Tris for the mite
material.
