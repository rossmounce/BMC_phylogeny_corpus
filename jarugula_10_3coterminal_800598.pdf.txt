3′-coterminal subgenomic RNAs and putative
cis-acting elements of Grapevine leafroll-associated
virus 3 reveals ‘unique’ features of gene
expression strategy in the genus Ampelovirus

Abstract
Background: The family Closteroviridae comprises genera with monopartite genomes, Closterovirus and
Ampelovirus, and with bipartite and tripartite genomes, Crinivirus. By contrast to closteroviruses in the genera
Closterovirus and Crinivirus, much less is known about the molecular biology of viruses in the genus Ampelovirus,
although they cause serious diseases in agriculturally important perennial crops like grapevines, pineapple, cherries
and plums.
Results: The gene expression and cis-acting elements of Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV-3; genus
Ampelovirus) was examined and compared to that of other members of the family Closteroviridae. Six putative
3′-coterminal subgenomic (sg) RNAs were abundantly present in grapevine (Vitis vinifera) infected with GLRaV-3.
The sgRNAs for coat protein (CP), p21, p20A and p20B were confirmed using gene-specific riboprobes in Northern
blot analysis. The 5′-termini of sgRNAs specific to CP, p21, p20A and p20B were mapped in the 18,498 nucleotide
(nt) virus genome and their leader sequences determined to be 48, 23, 95 and 125 nt, respectively. No conserved
motifs were found around the transcription start site or in the leader sequence of these sgRNAs. The predicted
secondary structure analysis of sequences around the start site failed to reveal any conserved motifs among the
four sgRNAs. The GLRaV-3 isolate from Washington had a 737 nt long 5′ nontranslated region (NTR) with a tandem
repeat of 65 nt sequence and differed in sequence and predicted secondary structure with a South Africa isolate.
Comparison of the dissimilar sequences of the 5′NTRs did not reveal any common predicted structures. The 3′NTR
was shorter and more conserved. The lack of similarity among the cis-acting elements of the diverse viruses in the
family Closteroviridae is another measure of the complexity of their evolution.
Conclusions: The results indicate that transcription regulation of GLRaV-3 sgRNAs appears to be different from
members of the genus Closterovirus. An analysis of the genome sequence confirmed that GLRaV-3 has an unusually
long 5′NTR of 737 nt compared to other monopartite members of the family Closteroviridae, with distinct
differences in the sequence and predicted secondary structure when compared to the corresponding region of the
GLRaV-3 isolate from South Africa.

composed of at least two capsid proteins which encapsidate single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genomes of
~15-20 kb [7,8]. The replication-associated proteins are
encoded by a signature ‘replication gene block’, made up
of domains for one or two papain-like proteinases,
methyl transferase- and helicase-like domains with large
interdomain region, and a +1 frameshift to express an
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-like domain. The
other genes are encoded in 7-12 open reading frames
(ORFs) and are expressed through a nested set of 3′coterminal subgenomic (sg) mRNAs. Among these
genes is a signature ‘quintuple gene module’ involved
largely in assembly of virions. The other ORFs vary in
number and arrangement and appear to be unique to
each species in the family.
Based on the well-studied closteroviruses and criniviruses,
the different 3′ genes are expressed at greatly variable
amounts, suggesting precise regulation of different proteins
in relation to the amounts needed during the virus life
cycle. With Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) as a model, there
appear to be general rules that determine the levels of production of the different 3′-coterminal sgRNAs. First, genes
located nearer to the 3′ terminus tend to be expressed at
higher levels than internal genes. The second rule is that
ORFs with an upstream nontranslated region are generally
expressed higher than those ORFs that overlap or do not
have an upstream nontranslated region. With CTV, the cisacting elements that regulate the level of expression of
genes in the 3′ half of the genome are located immediately
upstream to the transcription start site of their sgRNAs.
These elements generally consist of one or two stem-loop
(SL) structures with a downstream (plus sense) +1 site corresponding to the 5′ terminal adenosine of the sgRNA
[13,14]. Additionally, an adenylate appears to be the 5′-terminus of all sgRNAs encoded by CTV similar to the 5′
terminus of the genomic RNA [15]. In the case of Beet yellows virus (BYV), several sgRNAs have adenylate at their 5′
termini, with the exception of BYV p6 sgRNA that contains
a guanylate similar to the 5′ terminus of the genomic RNA
[16,17]. On the other hand, the 5′terminal nucleotide of the
sgRNAs of the crinivirus Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus
was reported to be variable, having adenylate, guanylate or
uridylate, and the 5′ ends of genomic RNA 1 and RNA 2
have conserved guanylates [18].
By contrast, much less is known about the molecular
biology of closteroviruses in the genus Ampelovirus,
although they cause serious diseases in agriculturally
important perennial crops like grapevines [19], pineapple [20], cherries [21] and plums [22]. Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV-3), the type member of
the genus Ampelovirus, represents the second largest
virus in the family Closteroviridae with a monopartite
genome of 18,498 nt [23], after CTV that has a 19,293
nt genome [24]. Similar to CTV, molecular variants of

GLRaV-3 have been documented using partial [25] and
full length sequences [23,26,27]. An analysis of the
sequences of GLRaV-3 isolates showed similar genome
organization with a relatively high degree of nucleotide
conservation across their genome, except in the 5′ nontranslated region (NTR). Also, the length of the 5′NTR
was reported to be different for different isolates. The
South Africa isolate was reported to have a 737 nt long
5′NTR [23], whereas New York [26] and Chile [27] isolates were reported to have 158 nt 5′NTRs.
The genome organization of GLRaV-3 is shown in Fig.
1. Unlike other viruses in the genera Closterovirus and
Ampelovirus, GLRaV-3 contains two small ORFs (p7 and
p4) nearest to the 3′-terminus of the genome. In the case
of BYV and CTV, the most 3′-proximal ORFs encode
highly expressed ~p21 kDa and ~p23 kDa proteins,
respectively, that function as replication enhancers [28,29].
In GLRaV-3, p20B, the counterpart to the BYV p21 ORF
or CTV p23 ORF, is present upstream of p7 and p4. Thus,
it appears that p7 and p4 are unique to GLRaV-3 and
counterparts of these genes are not present in other closteroviruses. Additionally, the order of arrangement of CP
and CPm is different in GLRaV-3 with the latter located
towards the 3′-terminus of the virus genome, when compared to their arrangement in viruses of the genus Closteroviruses. Moreover, the size of CPm of GLRaV-3 is much
larger than that of BYV and CTV.
In this study, we examined the gene expression strategy
and cis-acting elements of GLRaV-3 in comparison to
the other members of the Closteroviridae. Four of the
eleven putative 3′-coterminal sgRNAs accumulated at
high levels, two at intermediate levels, and the rest at low
levels in naturally infected grapevine tissues. The transcription start sites of the four abundantly expressed
sgRNAs were determined relative to the genomic RNA
and their leader sequences and upstream sequences,
where cis-acting sequences would be expected, were analyzed as a first step to elucidate gene expression strategy
in ampeloviruses. The results indicate that transcription
regulation of GLRaV-3 sgRNAs appears to be different
from members of the genus Closterovirus. An analysis of
the genome sequence confirmed that GLRaV-3 has an
unusually long 5′NTR of 737 nt compared to other
monopartite members of the family Closteroviridae, with
distinct differences in the sequence and predicted secondary structure when compared to the corresponding
region of the GLRaV-3 isolate from South Africa. In contrast, the 3′NTR of the two isolates is highly conserved.

Results
Some 3′-coterminal sgRNAs are abundantly present in
grapevines naturally infected with GLRaV-3

By analogy with BYV [4] and CTV [6], the two well studied members of the genus Closterovirus, ORFs

2 through 12, covering the 3′ half of the GLRaV-3 genome (Fig. 1) would be expected to be expressed via eleven 3′-coterminal sgRNAs. As a first step towards
comparative exploration of replication strategy of viruses
in the genus Ampelovirus, we investigated the presence
of sgRNAs in grapevine naturally infected with GLRaV3. Total RNA preparations from scrapings of bark tissues were analyzed by Northern blot hybridization with
positive-stranded RNA-specific riboprobes corresponding to nts 17,899 to 18,498 at the 3′ end of GLRaV-3
genomic RNA. As shown in Fig. 2, four sgRNAs were
present at higher levels and they were putatively identified as specific to p20B (ORF 10), p20A (ORF 9), p21
(ORF 8) and CP (ORF 6) genes. The two sgRNAs for p4
(ORF11) and p7 (ORF12) were not resolved due to the
small differences in their sizes and appeared as a single
moderately expressed band in Northern blots. The three
barely visible bands were putatively identified as sgRNAs
corresponding to CPm (ORF 7), p55 (ORF 5) and p5

+HSP70 h (ORFs 3 and 4) genes. The specificity of the
abundantly-accumulated sgRNAs to CP, p21, p20A and
p20B genes was further confirmed by hybridization with
riboprobes prepared using gene-specific sequences (Fig.
2). The riboprobe specific to the CPm hybridized weakly
with the corresponding sgRNA band. Since the riboprobe showed strong hybridization with sgRNA of the
CP, the observed weak signal further confirms that the
sgRNA of CPm is poorly expressed. Among the four
sgRNAs that accumulated at higher levels, the sgRNA
corresponding to p20B gene accumulated at the highest
level, followed by sgRNAs for p21, p20A and CP,
respectively (Fig. 2). These results suggest that 3′coterminal sgRNAs accumulate at variable amounts,
reflecting differences in their expression levels and/or
turnover rates in infected grapevine tissues. None of the
sgRNAs were detected with a riboprobe specific to the
5′NTR (data not shown) further confirming that they
are 3′-coterminal to the virus genome.

GLRaV-3 has an unusually long 5′NTR

In order to characterize the sgRNAs further and map
their locations in the virus genome, we needed to obtain
the sequence of the Washington isolate of GLRaV-3.
Although sequence is available for South Africa, Chile
and New York isolates of GLRaV-3, considerable variation in their genome size between 17,919 and 18,498 nt
warranted generating full genome sequence of the
Washington isolate. In addition, having genome
sequence information for the parental isolate of GLRaV3 would enable mapping the 5′-transcription start site of
sgRNAs more precisely in the cognate viral genome
sequence. Due to its large size, the entire genome of
GLRaV-3 was amplified into seven segments using
virus-specific primers (Additional file 1, Figure S1 and
Table S1). The cDNA clones representing each of the

Page 4 of 14

genomic segments were sequenced by directed sequencing protocol ("DNA walking”) using progressive
sequence-specific primers designed based on the partial
nucleotide sequence obtained. This strategy, instead of
cloning and sequencing by random oligonucleotide primers, decreased the number of steps required for determining the complete genome sequence of the virus and
assembling the consensus sequence into a full-length
genomic RNA sequence.
The RNA genome sequence of Washington isolate of
GLRaV-3 was determined to be 18,498 nt long and it
was deposited in GenBank under the accession no.
GU983863. The genome contains thirteen putative
ORFs with 737 nt long 5′NTR and 277 nt long 3′NTR
(Fig. 1). The genome organization of Washington isolate
was identical to GLRaV-3 isolates from New York [26],
Chile [27] and South Africa [23]. The sizes of different
ORFs and the 3′NTR were similar between all isolates
(Additional file 1, Table S2). However, the size of the 5′
NTR was significantly different, with New York and
Chile isolates containing 158 nt, and South Africa and
Washington isolates having 737 nt. In general, the genome of Washington isolate of GLRaV-3, downstream of
5′NTR sequence, showed higher level of nucleotide
sequence identity with corresponding sequence of virus
isolates from New York (~97%) and Chile (~99%) than
with South Africa isolate (~92%). Overall, higher
sequence identity values indicate that Washington isolate is closely related to GLRaV-3 isolates from New
York and Chile than to the South Africa isolate (Additional file 1, Table S2).
Due to the discrepancy in the size of 5′NTR of the
four GLRaV-3 isolates, we examined the sequence of 5′
NTR of several isolates from six cultivars: four wine
grape cultivars (Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot,
Chardonnay), one table grape cultivar (Thomson Seedless) and one juice grape cultivar (Concord) planted in
geographically widely separated regions in the US. The
5′RACE system was employed to verify the exact size of
5′NTR using two gene-specific downstream primers
complementary to 860 to 883 nt (primer M1012) and
1034 to 1059 nt (primer M1013) of ORF1a of the
Washington isolate. The expected DNA fragments from
RT-PCR amplification would be ~304 nt and ~480 nt, if
the 5′NTR is 158 nt in size as reported in New York
and Chile isolates or it would be ~883 nt and ~1059 nt,
if the 5′NTR is 737 nt in size as found in isolates from
Washington and South Africa (Fig. 3a). Using the
abridged anchor primer supplied with the 5′RACE kit as
an upstream primer (primer AAP), a single product of
~883 bp and ~1059 bp were amplified with virus-specific primers M1012 and M1013, respectively (Fig. 3b).
Sequence analysis of eight independent clones for each
isolate showed that the size of 5′NTR is 737 nt with

98-100% sequence identity with corresponding sequence
of the Washington isolate. The 5′NTR is A-U rich
(22.12% As and 47.49% Us) and showed 83% nucleotide
identity with the 5′NTR of the South Africa isolate. The
158 nt 5′NTR sequence of the Washington isolate
immediately upstream of ORF1a showed 100% identity
with corresponding 5′NTR sequences of New York and
Chile isolates. From these results it is clear that the 737
nt 5′NTR is indeed authentic and an unusually long
nontranslated sequence could be characteristic of
GLRaV-3 including New York and Chile isolates.

The 5′NTR of GLRaV-3 isolates shows complex but
distinct structural architecture than 3′NTR

Although the 5′NTRs of several GLRaV-3 isolates from
the US and South Africa were of the same size, pairwise
comparison showed non-uniform sequence identity distributed across the entire sequence (Fig. 4a). An unusually long stretch of 65 nt tandem repeat was observed
between nucleotides 187 to 315 in the 5′NTR of all isolates of GLRaV-3 from the US sequenced in this work,
where the first repeat was found between nucleotides
187-250 and the second between 251-315. Four

nucleotide differences were observed in the tandem
repeat sequences and these differences were distributed
randomly in the entire length of the repeat (Fig. 4b).
Whereas, such a signature tandem repeat was absent in
5′NTR of the South Africa isolate. However, the South
Africa isolate has an additional 65 nt sequence that
maintained 737 nt size of its 5′NTR (Fig. 4a). Alignment
of 5′NTR sequences showed high sequence identity in
the end sequences and in the middle portion with two
distinct, highly variable regions in between. To further

examine differences in the 5′NTR of GLRaV-3 isolates,
we compared their predicted secondary structure using
computational calculations at the MFOLD web server
[30]. The 5′NTR of Washington and South Africa isolates folded into a complex structure consisting of a
long SL structure with several substructural hairpins of
variable lengths (Fig. 5a). This indicated that, although
both isolates of GLRaV-3 have similar size 5′NTRs, the
primary sequence and the predicted secondary structural
architecture differed between them. In contrast, the 277

with the 5′ most one forming a complex structure containing four substructural hairpins of variable length.
Mapping the transcription start sites of the most
abundant sgRNAs revealed differences with other
monopartite members of the family Closteroviridae

nt 3′NTR of Washington, New York, Chile and South
Africa isolates of GLRaV-3 showed >97% similarity and
folded into identical secondary structures (complementary sequence) consisting of two long SL structures (Fig.
5b). The 5′ most SL consisted of 166 nt (18,333-18,498)
and the 3′most structure with 83 nt (18,240-18,322)

The members of the genera Closterovirus and Crinivirus
employ the production of sgRNAs to serve as messengers for specific genes as one of the adaptive strategies
to express their polycistronic genomes in their hosts
[4-6]. As a first step toward understanding strategies
underlying production of the sgRNAs of viruses in the
genus Ampelovirus, we mapped the 5′ termini of
the four most abundantly expressed genes in relation to
the genomic RNA of GLRaV-3. For this purpose, the 5′
ends of CP, p21, p20A and p20B sgRNAs were RT-PCR
amplified by the 5′RACE system from total RNA isolated from grapevine tissue infected with GLRaV-3
using a combination of an abridged anchor primer and
gene-specific primer, and the amplicons were cloned
into pGEM-T vector. Sequences obtained from six independent clones for each of the sgRNAs were identical
and were subsequently used to map the exact nucleotide
position of the 5′-end of each sgRNA. The results
showed that the length of sequence between the 5′-end
and the putative start codon of each ORF (sgRNA leader
sequence) is 48, 23, 95 and 125 nt, respectively, for CP,
p21, p20A and p20B sgRNAs (Fig. 6a). This data
demonstrated that the four sgRNAs have distinctly different sizes of mRNA leader sequences that are collinear
with the genomic RNA. All four sgRNAs started with an
adenylate, similar to the 5′-end of the genomic RNA.
Based on this information, the transcription start site
(TSS) for CP, p21, p20A and p20B was located at
13,800, 16,273, 16,755 and 17,265 nt, respectively, in the
genome sequence of the Washington isolate of GLRaV3 (Additional file 1, Table S3). The 48 nt leader
sequence of CP sgRNA is located entirely in the intergenic region (IGR) between p55 and CP, the 23 nt leader sequence of p21 encompass 13 nt C-terminus of
CPm ORF and 10 nt IGR between CPm and p21, the 95
nt leader sequence of p20A overlaps with the C-terminus of p21, and the 125 nt leader sequence of p20B
encompass 119 nt C-terminal portion of p20A and 6 nt
IGR between p20A and p20B. Using the location of
TSS, we estimated the size of sgRNA for CP, p21, p20A
and p20B (Fig. 6a) as 4,699, 2,226, 1,744 and 1,234 nts,
respectively (Additional file 1, Table S3). The TSS for
CP, p20A and p20B sgRNAs match with those reported
for South African isolate of GLRaV-3 [31]. The study by
Maree et al. [31] also indentified TSS for the other 3′
sgRNAs. However, we could not amplify 5′-end
sequences for the other sgRNAs (ORFs 2, 3, 4, 5, and

7), despite several attempts, possibly due to their low
abundance in infected grapevine tissue.
The 5′ leader sequences of CP, p21, p20A and p20B of
the Washington isolate were more similar (98-100% identity) to the corresponding sequences in the New York and
Chile isolates than with South Africa isolate (88-94% identity) (Additional file 1, Table S4). Except for the 5′-end
nucleotide, the leader sequences of the four sgRNAs did
not reveal any shared sequence motifs, in contrast with
the presence of a conserved heptanucleotide in some
sgRNAs of BYV and CTV [16]. Since conserved nucleotide
sequences around the TSS of sgRNA were implicated in
the synthesis of sgRNAs of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)
[32] and Citrus tatter leaf virus (CTLV) [33], we compared
a 50 nt region around the TSS (-25 to +25 relative to the
initiation site of each sgRNA) of each of the four sgRNAs
of GLRaV-3. The results revealed no conserved sequences
surrounding the TSS, in contrast to the presence of conserved octanucleotide sequences in TMV and CTLV.
The sequences upstream of the ORFs of CTV were
shown to control production of sgRNAs [13,14]. In general, the minus strands corresponding to these regions
could be folded into one or two SL structures with the
first nucleotide (A) of the sgRNA leader a few nucleotides
downstream of the last SL structure [34]. To predict the
possible involvement of RNA secondary structures in the
sgRNA synthesis analogous to TMV, CTLV and CTV,
the 50 nt sequence corresponding to the minus strand
sequence around the TSS of the four sgRNAs was analyzed by MFOLD [30]. The results showed that, although
the 50 nt sequence corresponding to the minus strand
sequence of sgRNAs for CP, p21, p20A and p20B folded
into predicted SL structures, conservation of the predicted secondary structures was not observed (Fig. 6b).
The 5′end nucleotide of sgRNA specific to CP and p20A
was located outside the SL structure, whereas that specific to p21 sgRNA was located on the stem of the SL
structure and it was in the loop in the case of p20B
sgRNA. The integrity of these secondary structural features were maintained in the leader sequences of all
GLRaV-3 isolates, despite low (84-94%) sequence identity
especially between Washington and South Africa isolates,
suggesting a requirement for the putative secondary
structure in sgRNA synthesis. The genome sequences
immediately ~100 nt upstream from the 5′ terminus of
each sgRNA were also compared to verify the possible
conservation in the putative control elements for sgRNA
production. The data revealed no similarity between the
sequences or their predicted structures and no structures
similar to those found for CTV.

Discussion
Synthesis of 3′-coterminal sgRNAs is one of the genome
expression strategies adapted by members of the family

Closteroviridae. Evidence gathered with viruses in the
genera Closterovirus [4,6] and Crinivirus [5,18,35]
demonstrated that the temporal expression and kinetics
of accumulation of these sgRNAs is highly regulated
and level of sgRNAs expressed depends on promoter
strength and position within the genome. However,
expression strategies of sgRNAs for members of the
genus Ampelovirus have not been studied to date,
despite their economic importance to many agriculturally important crops. The characteristic profiles of
sgRNAs obtained in Northern blots from virus-infected
grapevine (Fig. 2) provided evidence that GLRaV-3 likely
employs a strategy for the expression of its nested set of
3′-coterminal sgRNAs similar to other closteroviruses.
However, accumulation of sgRNAs detected in virusinfected grapevine tissue indicated differences in the
levels of expression of specific sgRNAs compared to
other monopartite closteroviruses like BYV and CTV
[15,16,36,37]. Since results of this study were from an
asynchronous infection, it is possible that the amounts
and timing of synthesis of sgRNAs in GLRaV-3-infected
tissue are variable during the growing season and
remains to be elucidated to determine whether their
profile changes in relation to the developmental stage or
expression of grapevine leafroll disease symptoms [19].
The sgRNAs for p7 and p4 ORFs, located close to the
3′ terminus of GLRaV-3 genome, accumulated at lower
levels than sgRNAs specific to upstream ORFs p20B,
p20A and p21. Similarly, the sgRNA specific to the CP
showed higher accumulation than the sgRNA specific to
CPm, which is closer to the 3′ terminus. Another unique
feature of GLRaV-3 is that the sgRNAs specific to p21
ORF, which has only a 10 nt 5′nontranslated region
upstream of the ORF where a cis-acting promoter element would be expected to occur, and the sgRNA corresponding to the p20A ORF, which lacks an upstream
nontranslated region due to overlap with the upstream
p21 ORF, accumulate at more or less similar levels compared to sgRNA of the CP ORF that has an 89 nt
upstream nontranslated region. These results clearly
suggest that GLRaV-3 does not follow either of the two
general rules: (i) genes located nearer the 3′terminus are
usually expressed at higher levels and (ii) ORFs with a 5′
nontranslated region are generally expressed higher than
ORFs that overlap with the upstream ORF (and hence
no nontranslated region). Instead, it is likely that production of GLRaV-3 sgRNAs follows an alternative or
modified mechanism.
The mapping of 5′ termini of four 3′-terminal genes
(CP, p21, p20A and p20B) of GLRaV-3 indicated that
they possess a +1 adenylate, same as the 5′ end of the
genome, and this observation was analogous to CTV
than to other closteroviruses like BYV [16-18]. The leader sequences of GLRaV-3 sgRNAs are collinear with

Jarugula et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:180
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/180

the genomic RNA and their relative lengths are within
the range observed for sgRNAs of CTV and BYV. The
first few nucleotides of the 5′ end of the genomic RNA
(ATAAATG) and the genomic sequence around the 5′
termini of sgRNAs (underlined, CP [TTTTATAAA],
p21 [TCTTAGAAA], p20A [ATTGAATGA], p20B
[AAGTATATT]) were similar but not identical AU-rich
regions. Presence of an adenylate as the 5′ terminus in
the genomic and all four sgRNAs suggested that initiation of RNA synthesis from an uridylate on the minus
strand is preferred by the GLRaV-3 replicase complex,
similar to that proposed for CTV [15]. However, the
lack of sequence conservation around the 5′ termini and
the absence of secondary structure elements or octanucleotides conserved in BYV and CTV nontranslated leader regions suggest that sgRNA expression strategy in
GLRaV-3 could be somewhat different leading to the
hypothesis that some commonalities do exist in the
replication strategy between closteroviruses and ampeloviruses, but also some features characteristic to
ampeloviruses.
In this study, the complete genomic RNA sequence of
GLRaV-3 was determined to consist of 18,498 nt and is
in agreement with the size of GLRaV-3 isolate reported
from South Africa [23]. The overall genome organization
of these two isolates is similar to that of GLRaV-3 isolates
sequenced from New York and Chile. All four isolates
have highly conserved 3′NTRs than 5′NTRs due to the
unusual variation in size and sequence between them.
Given the same size 5′NTR in two GLRaV-3 genome
sequences obtained by independent groups in distant
locations [this study and 23], it is likely that artifacts in
cloning would have resulted in the apparent small size 5′
NTR reported for New York and Chile isolates. It could
be possible that use of poly (A) tailing to amplify the 5′
NTR and the likelihood of non-specific annealing of
oligo (dT) primer to a portion of 5′NTR with high adenines in the complementary DNA strand of GLRaV-3
would have contributed to the amplification of less-than
full size sequence at the 5′ terminal portion of the genome [26]. The 5′portion of GLRaV-3 isolate from Chile
was amplified by RT-PCR using primers designed based
on the sequence of New York isolate [27] and hence may
not be a true representation of the authentic 5′end of
virus genome. In contrast, our study and that reported
from South Africa [23] used 5′RACE to accurately map
the 5′end of GLRaV-3 genome. Additionally, same size
PCR products with high level of sequence similarity
amplified from GLRaV-3 isolates originating from different grapevine cultivars planted in geographically distinct
locations in the US provided additional evidence that the
size of 5′NTR determined in our study is accurate.
A 737 nt long 5′NTR in GLRaV-3 genome represents
the longest 5′NTR among the currently known

Page 10 of 14

monopartite members of the family Closteroviridae
available in database. The sizes of 5′NTR in viruses of
the genus Closterovirus is between 105 and 227 nt and
those in the genus Ampelovirus between 213 and 737
nt, respectively. In contrast, the bipartite and tripartite
members of the genus Crinivirus have 72 to 264 nt 5′
NTR in RNA 1. Thus, highly variable size of 5′NTR
appears to be a characteristic of the members in the
genus Ampelovirus in the family Closteroviridae. In
addition, the 5′NTRs of grapevine-infecting closteroviruses, such as GLRaV-1, GLRaV-2 and GLRaV-Pr, for
which complete genome sequences are available in the
database, are variable in size with no significant
sequence homology between them. Outside of the family
Closteroviridae, a long 5′NTR of 739 nt was recently
observed in Triticum mosaic virus (TriMV), a wheatinfecting virus in the family Potyviridae [38]. To our
knowledge, GLRaV-3 and TriMV appears to be the only
plant viruses with monopartite genome known to date
with such a long sequence in their 5′NTR. A long 5′
NTR in plant viruses is unusual, but a long 5′NTR ranging in length from 610 to 1500 nt has been reported in
animal/human-infecting viruses in the family Picornaviridae [39]. Unlike 5′NTRs of TriMV and picornaviruses,
which contain multiple non-conserved AUG upstream
of the initiation codon, the 737 nt long 5′NTR of
GLRaV-3 isolates contain only one AUG triplet at the
very 5′terminus (5′-ATAAATGCTC) preceding the
translation initiation codon of the ORF1 polyprotein.
Thus, the long 5′NTR of GLRaV-3 appears to have features distinct from other plant and animal infecting
viruses. The 5′NTR sequences in many picornaviruses
and flaviviruses are highly structured to form internal
ribosome entry (IRES) elements that play a role in protein translation in a cap-independent manner [40]. It
remains to be studied if any potential IRES elements
exist in the 5′NTR of GLRaV-3. At a practical level, the
high variability in 5′NTR could be useful for discriminating GLRaV-3 isolates from different grape-growing
areas around the world into phylogenetically distinct
lineages.
In the case of CTV, the 5′NTRs of all isolates could be
folded into two similar stem-loop structures despite the
fact that their sequence varied by as much as 58% [41].
These two conserved structures were shown to be
important for replication and assembly [7,42]. Even
though we showed a complex secondary structure for 5′
NTR of GLRaV-3 isolates (Fig. 5a) as predicted by using
the MFOLD program, the complex structures did not
seem to be conserved between the Washington and
South Africa isolates. A tandem repeat of 65 nt in the 5′
NTR sequence of many GLRaV-3 isolates from the US,
but not in the 5′NTR of the South Africa isolate, is surprising and the functional importance of this repeat

Jarugula et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:180
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/180

sequence in virus life cycle needs to be examined. In
contrast to the 5′NTR, the 3′NTR of the four GLRaV-3
isolates is highly conserved and folded into identical secondary structure (Fig. 5b). This pattern is analogous to
CTV, but different from BYV, where different isolates
were shown to have considerable differences in size and
sequence identity in the 3′NTR [28]. It has been shown
with CTV that the 3′NTR contains cis-acting elements
required to initiate synthesis of complementary negative
strands and some of the predicted secondary structures
are important components for efficient replication [43]
and it is likely that the predicted SL structures in the 3′
NTR contain cis-acting elements to play a critical role
in GLRaV-3 replication.

Conclusions
This study has shown that four of the eleven putative 3′coterminal sgRNAs were abundantly present in the total
RNA extracted from grapevine naturally infected with
GLRaV-3 in Northern blots using gene-specific riboprobes. The 5′ termini of sgRNAs specific to CP, p21,
p20A and p20B were mapped in the virus genome and
their leader sequences determined to be 48, 23, 95, and
125 nt, respectively, and they were collinear with the
genomic RNA. The lack of conserved motifs around the
transcription start site or in the leader sequences of
these sgRNAs indicated that transcription regulation
of GLRaV-3 sgRNAs could be different from members
of the genus Closterovirus and suggests the lack of evolutionary conservation in the regulation of gene transcription among monopartite members of the family
Closteroviridae. The 5′NTR of GLRaV-3 has an unusually long 5′NTR of 737 nt compared to other members of the family Closteroviridae and showed distinct
differences in the sequence and predicted secondary
structure between two distinct isolates of GLRaV-3.
Availability of an infectious cDNA clone of GLRaV-3
would clearly help to explore the mechanism(s) by
which the 3′-coterminal sg-mRNAs are produced and
make comparative assessment of replication strategies
among members of the genera Closterovirus and Ampelovirus and their adaptation to disparate plant hosts and
insect vectors.
Methods

Page 11 of 14

The integrity of dsRNA preparations were verified by
resolving in 0.8% agarose gels and using dsRNAenriched preparation from citrus (Sour Orange) infected
with Citrus trizteza virus (CTV). Unless otherwise mentioned, the same dsRNA preparation was used for cloning and sequencing of the entire genome of GLRaV-3.
cDNA synthesis, RT-PCR, cloning and sequence analyses

The denatured dsRNA served as a template for cDNA
synthesis. The reaction was carried out in 25 μL reaction mixture in the presence of gene-specific complementary primer using Superscript III reverse
transcriptase kit (Invitrogen Corp, Carlsbad, CA) by following the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA preparation was used as a template for subsequent PCR
amplification of different portions of the virus genome
(Additional file 1, Figure S1) using primers listed in
Additional file 1, Table S1). These primers were initially
designed based on nucleotide sequence information
available for New York isolate of GLRaV-3 (AF037268),
[26]. Primers for subsequent experiments were designed
based on the sequence obtained for GLRaV-3 isolate
from Washington (accession no. GU983863). Unless stated otherwise, locations of all primers were indicated
using the entire genome sequence of GLRaV-3 isolate
from Washington. Each PCR reaction in 20 μL consisted
of a final concentration of 2-4 ng of template cDNA, 0.3
μMoles each of sense and antisense primers, 0.2 mM of
each dNTP, 1X concentration of reaction buffer consisting 1 mM Mg 2+ and 0.025 U of high fidelity Takara
Prime Star DNA polymerase (Takara Bio Inc., Japan).
The temperature profile for the amplification included
denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec followed by 35 cycles of
denaturation at 98°C for 10 sec, annealing at 60°C for 5
sec and extension at 72°C for 60 sec per 1 kb size of
amplicon and a final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes.
The amplicons were cloned in pUC-119 based vector
and two independent clones specific to each amplicon
were sequenced in both orientations at the Molecular
Biology Core Instrumentation Facility, Washington State
University, Pullman, WA. Wherever necessary, additional clones were sequenced to resolve nucleotide
sequence ambiguities. Nucleotide and predicted amino
acid sequences were analyzed using Vector NTI
Advance11 software (Invitrogen Corp, Carlsbad, CA).

Virus source and preparation of double-stranded RNA

GLRaV-3 isolates were collected from five wine grape
cultivars (Vitis vinifera, cvs. Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah,
Merlot, Chardonnay), one table grape cultivar (V. vinifera, cv. Thomson Seedless) and one juice grape cultivar
(V. labruscana ’Concord’). Cambial scrapings of canes
from a single Merlot grapevine were used for isolating
genomic-length replicative-form double-stranded (ds)
RNA essentially as described by Valverde et al. [44].

Rapid amplification of cDNA ends of GLRaV-3

The exact 5′ end sequence of GLRaV-3 was determined
using a commercially available 5′RACE system for rapid
amplification of cDNA ends kit (Version 2.0, Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). Total RNA was isolated from bark scrapings of canes collected from GLRaV-3-infected Merlot
vines based on a protocol reported by Tattersall et al.
[45]. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using the gene-

Jarugula et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:180
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/180

specific primer AR (5′-CATTAAGGGCCCTGTTAAAC3′, complementary to nucleotides 833 to 852 of the
Washington isolate, GU983863). The purified firststrand cDNA was ‘dC’ tailed and the following primer
combinations were used to amplify virus-specific DNA
fragments: virus-specific primer M1012 (5′-AAGTCCGACAACTTCACGTTCCCT-3′, complementary to
nucleotides 860 to 883 in GU983863) and the abridged
anchor primer (AAP) supplied with the kit and virusspecific primer M1013 (5′-AAGTTGAGGTCCTTG
CCTCCATCAAG-3′, complementary to nucleotides
1034 to 1059 in GU983863) and the AAP supplied with
the kit. The temperature profile for the amplification of
DNA included denaturation at 94°C for 3 min followed
by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 10 sec, annealing at 56°C for 30 sec and extension at 72°C for 60 sec
and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min.
For verification of 3′end sequence of GLRaV-3, total
RNA was poly-adenylated with Yeast Poly(A) polymerase (USB, Cleveland, OH) and used for cDNA synthesis
using SuperScriptIII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). The first-strand cDNA was used as a
template to amplify virus-specific DNA using an oligo
dT primer M111 (5′-GGTCTCGAG(T) 18 -3′) and a
virus-specific forward primer GF (5′-ATTAGCATATGTAGAAAAGGGGAAG-3′, nucleotides 18174 to 18198
in GU983863). The 5′ and 3′ RACE PCR products were
cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI)
and six independent clones specific to each PCR product were sequenced in both orientations. Sequences
were analyzed as described above.
Riboprobe preparation and Northern blot hybridization

Total RNA extracts prepared from cambial scrapings
collected from GLRaV-3-infected Merlot grapevines
were separated by electrophoresis in a formaldehyde
denaturing 1.1% agarose gel in MOPS buffer, and transferred onto a nylon membrane using an electrotransfer
unit (Hoefer Pharmacia Biotech, San fransisco, CA) as
described by Lewandowski and Dawson [46]. Northern
blot hybridization and probing of membranes for the
presence of genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs of
GLRaV-3 with nonradioactive digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled
riboprobes was carried out according to Tatineni et al.
[33]. The probe for detecting all sgRNAs includes
17,899-18,498 nt at the 3′ terminus of the Washington
isolate of GLRaV-3 (Additional file 1, Table S5). DNA
template for gene-specific riboprobe synthesis were
amplified from virus-specific clones in pUC119 using
the primers listed in Additional file 1, Table S5 and
Table S6. T7 and SP6 polymerase promoter sequences
were included in the forward and reverse primers,
respectively, and the PCR amplified products were agarose-gel eluted and used as a template to generate

positive-stranded RNA-specific probes by using T7- or
SP6-RNA polymerase and nucleotides containing DIGlabeled UTP.
Mapping the transcription start sites of GLRaV-3-sgRNAs

Total RNA isolated from cambial scrapings of GLRaV-3infected Merlot grapevine was used to map the transcription start sites of four sgRNAs, namely, CP, p21,
p20A and p20B. The gene specific primers (Additional
file 1, Table S7) were used to synthesize the first-strand
cDNAs. The first-strand cDNAs were column purified
and ‘dC’ tailed at the 5′ end using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, and amplified by using 2.5 U of Taq
DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA)
in a 50 μL reaction volume with an abridged anchor primer (supplied with kit) together with gene specific
nested primer. The following conditions were used for
PCR: 1 cycle at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles at
94°C for 20 sec, 56°C for 20 sec and 72°C for 1 min,
and one cycle at 72°C for 5 min. The PCR products
were ligated into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, WI)
and the inserts were sequenced at the DNA sequencing
Core, Interdesciplinary Center for Biotechnology
Research, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.
Sequence analysis

Sequences were edited and assembled using ContigExpress module in the VectorNTI sequence analysis software package (Invitrogen Corp, Carlsbad, CA).
Nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity levels were
calculated using Vector NTI Advance program (Invitrogen Corp. CA). Secondary structure analysis of the 5′
NTR and 3′NTR sequences was carried out by using
MFOLD software [30].
