Yeast transcriptional network evolution

Abstract
Background: Recent technical and methodological advances have placed microbial models at the
forefront of evolutionary and environmental genomics. To better understand the logic of genetic
network evolution, we combined comparative transcriptomics, a differential clustering algorithm
and promoter analyses in a study of the evolution of transcriptional networks responding to an
antifungal agent in two yeast species: the free-living model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
the human pathogen Candida glabrata.
Results: We found that although the gene expression patterns characterizing the response to
drugs were remarkably conserved between the two species, part of the underlying regulatory
networks differed. In particular, the roles of the oxidative stress response transcription factors
ScYap1p (in S. cerevisiae) and Cgap1p (in C. glabrata) had diverged. The sets of genes whose benomyl
response depends on these factors are significantly different. Also, the DNA motifs targeted by
ScYap1p and Cgap1p are differently represented in the promoters of these genes, suggesting that
the DNA binding properties of the two proteins are slightly different. Experimental assays of
ScYap1p and Cgap1p activities in vivo were in accordance with this last observation.
Conclusions: Based on these results and recently published data, we suggest that the robustness
of environmental stress responses among related species contrasts with the rapid evolution of
regulatory sequences, and depends on both the coevolution of transcription factor binding
properties and the versatility of regulatory associations within transcriptional networks.

Background

As evolutionary changes frequently involve modifications to
transcriptional regulatory programs, the integration of gene
expression data into classic cross-species comparisons based

on protein or DNA sequence similarity is a powerful approach
likely to improve our understanding of phenotypic diversity
among organisms. Sequence similarity between genes or proteins is not always proportional to the conservation of func-

tion during evolution [1,2] and investigations of the
conservation of gene expression patterns are, therefore, useful for precise determinations of function [3-5]. Comparative
functional analyses have been made possible by the accumulation of large-scale gene expression datasets for a large
number of organisms, due directly to the exponential increase
in the number of species for which whole genome sequences
are available [6,7]. The development of methodologies for
comparing genome-wide gene expression data between species has been challenging, and several computational
approaches have been proposed in the past five years for the
integration of cross-species expression and sequence comparisons [2,8-12]. Combining sequence and expression data
appeared to be useful for improving functional annotation of
genes [13,14], for refining modules of homologous genes in
different organisms [15,16] or for increasing our understanding of the regulatory relationships between genes among species [17,18].
Pioneering studies focused on evolutionarily distant model
organisms, for which all the publicly available microarray
data were combined into a single dataset [8,9]. These studies
gave interesting results, demonstrating the potential of crossspecies comparisons based on expression data. However, the
evolutionary distance between the compared species and the
combination of unrelated expression data limited the conclusions to the characterization of transcriptional modules consisting of large numbers of genes with very high levels of
sequence conservation and very highly correlated expression
patterns. To increase the accuracy of investigations of the
evolution of genetic networks, we would like, in an ideal case,
to: compare selected microarray experiments that are as similar as possible for all species considered; and compare species separated by an optimal evolutionary distance, that is,
species sharing a high level of orthology but with different
lifestyles and physiological properties [11]. In this respect, the
hemiascomycete phylum constitutes a valuable model. Yeast
species have evolved in niches with constantly varying nutrient availability and growth conditions, and have thus had to
develop sophisticated mechanisms for controlling genome
expression. More than ten yeast species have now been fully
sequenced [19,20], opening up new possibilities for studying
the adaptation of transcriptional networks to environmental
constraints over a progressive evolutionary scale spanning
400 million years [11,21].
We present here a comparative analysis of the transcriptional
programs driving the chemical stress response in two evolutionarily close yeast species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
Candida glabrata [20]. C. glabrata is a pathogenic yeast and
the frequency of systemic infections with this yeast is increasing, perhaps due to the extensive use of azole antifungal
agents, to which C. glabrata may be resistant [22,23]. In contrast to S. cerevisiae, in which genome expression has been
extensively studied, very few functional genomic studies have
yet been carried out for C. glabrata, and very little is known

Volume 9, Issue 11, Article R164

Lelandais et al. R164.2

about its drug resistance pathways [24,25]. Most functional
annotations of C. glabrata genes are currently based on
sequence similarity with genes of S. cerevisiae that have been
well characterized functionally. One clear challenge for comparative functional genomics concerns the extension of our
considerable knowledge of S. cerevisiae genetic networks to
other yeasts, such as C. glabrata. With this goal in mind, we
focused on the early genomic events characterizing the stress
response induced by benomyl, an antifungal agent that inhibits cell growth during mitosis.
In S. cerevisiae, benomyl has been shown to activate an oxidative stress response primarily dependent on the transcription factor ScYap1p [26]. Our global analyses showed that this
drug induces the expression of orthologous gene pairs
involved in oxidative stress responses similarly in both species, suggesting a high degree of conservation of the corresponding pathways in these two species. Combining the
differential clustering algorithm (DCA) [10] with promoter
sequence analyses, we observed that, despite the highly conserved patterns of expression of genes regulated by benomyl
in the two species, the transcriptional pathway related to the
transcription factor Yap1p appeared to have substantially
changed. Experimental assessment of the genes actually controlled by Cgap1p, the functional homolog of ScYap1p in C.
glabrata, indicated that even if Cgap1p retained an important
role in the benomyl response, this function was less important than that of ScYap1p in the S. cerevisiae benomyl
response. Interestingly, the Yap1 response element (YRE),
which is the most enriched in the promoters of Cgap1p target
genes, is only marginally present in the promoters of Yap1pdependent genes. Finally, our data are consistent with a
divergence of the Cgap1p recognition sites from the preferred
binding sequences for ScYap1p. In terms of the oxidative
stress response, this divergence of the promoter regions
between S. cerevisiae and C. galabrata is counterbalanced by
coevolution of the DNA binding sites of transcription factors
and by the flexibility of transcriptional networks, ensuring the
robustness of the genomic response of cells to hostile chemical environments.

Results
Transcript profiling with identical experimental
conditions in both yeast species
Benomyl dose and measurement times
We carried out microarray analyses of the transcriptome
responses of S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata following identical
treatments with the antifungal agent benomyl [27]. Both
yeast strains were subjected, in parallel, to the growth conditions defined in our previous study [26]: 20 μg/ml benomyl
for 2, 4, 10, 20, 40 and 80 minutes. Labeled cDNA from
treated cells was hybridized with S. cerevisiae or C. glabrata
microarrays in the presence of cDNA from mock-treated cells
as a competitor.

Global analysis of changes in gene expression shows quantitatively
similar transcriptional responses
We used principal component analysis (PCA) to obtain a global view of the changes in gene expression occurring in
response to the addition of benomyl. This multivariate statistical technique allowed us to identify new variables - the principal components (PCs) - that are linear combinations of the
original time vectors and account for the largest proportion of
the variance of the data. A complete description of PCA can be
found in [28]. The results of independent PCAs for S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata benomyl expression data are presented
in Figure 1a, b. In both yeasts, more than 90% of the observed
variability was accounted for by the first two principal components (Figure 1a, b, right panels). These were used for the
simultaneous representation of all the microarray results
(Figure 1a, b, left panels). The resulting PCA diagrams were
very similar, suggesting that benomyl had a similar impact on
the transcriptomes of S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata. Interestingly, the dominant component PC1 consisted primarily of
time vectors 80 and 40 minutes in S. cerevisiae (loadings
were 43% and 34%, respectively), whereas in C. glabrata, PC1
consisted primarily of the earlier time vectors 40 and 20 minutes (loadings were 30% and 31%, respectively). Such a result
meant that the maximal expression variability in S. cerevisiae
was reached at later times compared with that of C. glabrata,
and was in agreement with pair-wise correlation values calculated between different time points in different species (Figure 1c; Additional data file 1). In summary, our PCA and
cross-species correlation analyses stated that the two benomyl responses were quantitatively similar, although the C.
glabrata response was faster than that of S. cerevisiae.

Definition of lists of genes displaying significant changes in expression
in response to benomyl
From all the genes for which expression data were available,
we identified genes whose expression was significantly modified after benomyl addition, using the significance analysis of
microarrays (SAM) procedure [29]. In total, 228 genes in S.
cerevisiae and 272 genes in C. glabrata were found to be upregulated, whereas 379 genes in S. cerevisiae and 298 genes
in C. glabrata were found to be down-regulated (Additional
data file 2).

Construction of an orthology table for expression comparisons
To address the evolution of transcriptional programs
involved in chemical stress responses, it was important to
determine whether 'orthologous' genes in the two yeasts were
similarly involved in the biological processes comprising the
benomyl stress response. We inferred orthology relationships
between the complete genomes of S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata, using the INPARANOID algorithm [30]. We found
orthology links in S. cerevisiae for almost 90% of the C. glabrata genes. Such a result pointed out the high coding
sequence similarity between the two genomes [21]. Orthologous gene pairs for which at least one gene (in one species)
displayed a change in expression in response to benomyl

stress were then identified. In total, 718 orthologous gene
pairs were selected and used as the kernel for cross-species
comparisons.

Global comparison of transcriptional networks, based
on DCA and promoter analyses
DCA reveals significant conservation of coexpression relationships
between orthologous genes
DCA [10] was used to investigate the evolutionary properties
of clusters of genes coexpressed in one or both of the yeast
species. This approach systematically characterizes the conservation of coexpression patterns between genes, by means
of an original method involving the clustering of orthologous
gene pairs according to their behavior in each species (see
Materials and methods; Additional data file 3). Briefly, DCA
is a two-step procedure involving: the definition of transcriptional modules of coexpressed genes in one species (referred
to as the 'reference' species); and the definition of two subgroups of genes (named 'a' and 'b') in each module, using the
expression data for the orthologous genes in the second species (referred to as the 'target' species). Finally, the similarity
of expression profiles in subgroups a and b is estimated, calculating three correlation values corresponding to the mean
correlation of gene expression measurements within and
between subgroups a and b. Depending on these correlation
values, the modules will be classified in the 'full', 'partial',
'split' or 'no' conservation categories (Figure 2a). In the particular case of benomyl response, eight coexpression clusters
were defined on the basis of the gene expression data for S.
cerevisiae. Based on expression measurements for orthologous genes in C. glabrata, three of these modules were annotated as displaying full conservation (cluster 2 = 132 genes,
cluster 7 = 12 genes and cluster 8 = 66 genes), three modules
were annotated as displaying partial conservation (cluster 1 =
58 genes, cluster 3 = 197 genes and cluster 6 = 110 genes) and
two modules were annotated as displaying split conservation
(cluster 4 = 51 genes and cluster 5 = 92 genes). The different
transcriptional modules and their biological properties are
described in Additional data file 4 and complete gene lists in
each module can be found in Additional data file 5. Taken as
a whole, the full conservation clusters (2, 7 and 8) and the
conserved parts of the partial conservation clusters (cluster 1b
= 42 genes, cluster 3b = 112 genes and cluster 6b = 75 genes)
demonstrated a strong evolutionary conservation of the transcriptional pathways driving the benomyl response in the two
species, more than 60% of the orthologous gene pairs conserving their co-expression properties.

Promoter analyses identify three conserved transcriptional pathways
We investigated the regulatory processes governing the benomyl stress response by combining our time course expression
data with comparative analyses of the promoter sequences. In
each species, we applied the MatrixREDUCE algorithm [31]
and identified significant position-specific affinity matrices
(PSAMs) that represent the sequence-specific binding affinity
of potential transcription factors. Complete results obtained

with MatrixREDUCE are shown in Additional data file 6.
Most notably, we could identify three pairs of PSAMs between
S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata that exhibited significant Pearson correlations (r > 0.6); these are shown in Figure 2b (left
panel) and correspond to specific regulatory sequences that
are evolutionary conserved. The AAAATTT (PSAM 1 in S. cerevisiae and PSAM 1 in C. glabrata) and CGATGAG (PSAM 3
in S. cerevisiae and PSAM 4 in C. glabrata) motifs correspond to motifs named rRPE and PAC, respectively [32,33].
They have been identified in the promoters of genes repressed
during the environmental stress response, most of which
encode ribosomal proteins or proteins involved in ribosome
biogenesis and rRNA processing [34]. The AGGGG motif
(PSAM 2 in S. cerevisiae and PSAM 2 in C. glabrata) correspond to the stress response element (STRE) identified in the
promoters recognized by the environmental stress response
factors Msn2p and Msn4p [35]. This inter-species conservation of DNA motifs involved in both down- and up-regulation
of genes responding to benomyl indicate that at least three
identical transcriptional pathways were involved in the chemical stress response in S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata. To
expand on this observation, we examined in more detail the
appearance of these three motifs in the promoters of the
orthologous genes that we analyzed with DCA (Figure 2a),
making a distinction between orthologous pairs that belong
to the conserved and the non-conserved parts of the DCA
clusters (Figure 2b, right panel). For each motif, we could
observed that its position relative to that of the open reading
frame (ORF) start codon was highly conserved between the
two yeasts and that its frequency was systematically higher in
the conserved DCA clusters than in the non-conserved parts.
In summary, the combination of DCA and MatrixREDUCE
efficiently extracted a set of orthologous genes whose expression and regulation is conserved between the two species
examined here.

Comparative analysis of the Yap1p-mediated
transcriptional modules controlling the benomyl stress
response in S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata
ScYap1p and Cgap1p have different impacts on benomyl response
The transcription factor ScYap1p has been extensively studied in S. cerevisiae as a major regulator of the oxidative stress
response [36]. It is one of the main coordinators of the early
transcriptional response to benomyl stress [26]. In agree-

ment with these previous reports, our promoter analysis of
the S. cerevisiae benomyl response identified a PSAM whose
consensus sequence (T(G/T)ACTAA) is compatible with the
YRE, that is, the binding site of ScYap1p (S. cerevisiae PSAM
4; Additional data file 6). A homolog of ScYap1p was recently
identified in C. glabrata [37]. This homolog, named Cgap1p,
restores drug resistance in a S. cerevisiae yap1Δ mutant [37]
and regulates the expression of CgFLR1 in response to benomyl [37]. In S. cerevisiae, the ScFLR1 gene encodes a transporter of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) involved in
multidrug resistance and is a well known transcriptional target of ScYap1p [38]. The observation that the orthologous
genes CgFLR1 (in C. glabrata) and ScFLR1 (in S. cerevisiae)
may be similarly regulated by Cgap1p and ScYap1p suggested
that the Yap1p-mediated transcriptional modules were at
least partly conserved between S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata.
However, none of the PSAMs identified in C. glabrata exhibited significant Pearson correlation with the S. cerevisiae
YRE-PSAM (Additional data file 6). To highlight the role
played by Cgap1p in the benomyl response of C. glabrata, we
carried out a series of transcriptome analyses, directly comparing gene expression in the C. glabrata wild-type strain
and a CgAP1Δ strain 20 minutes after benomyl addition. Differential gene expression analysis showed that CgAP1 deletion affected the benomyl-mediated induction of 66 of the 272
up-regulated genes (Figure 3a). Therefore, Cgap1p played a
key role in the benomyl response by controlling the expression of almost 25% of the genes induced in our experiments.
Nevertheless, this contribution was smaller than in S. cerevisiae, in which more than 40% of the genes up-regulated by
benomyl in this study are regulated by ScYap1p (Figure 3a).
Moreover, we could observe that the sets of genes whose benomyl response depends on Cgap1p or ScYap1p are significantly different since only 14 orthologous genes were
identified between them. Complete lists of Cgap1p and
ScYap1p target genes are supplied in Additional data file 7.

Differences in the benomyl response element between S. cerevisiae
and C. glabrata
The observation that a quarter of the C. glabrata genes sensitive to benomyl depend on the transcription factor Cgap1p for
their upregulation apparently conflicts with the lack of interspecies correlation between YRE-PSAMs. To extend the
MatrixREDUCE results, we searched for all published data

Figurecomparison of the S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata chemical stress responses based on DCA and MatrixREDUCE analyses
Global 2 (see previous page)
Global comparison of the S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata chemical stress responses based on DCA and MatrixREDUCE analyses. (a) We
analyzed 718 orthologous gene pairs for which at least one gene displayed a change in expression in response to benomyl stress using the DCA method
[10]. The DCA cluster pairs of orthologous genes according to their expression in each species (see Additional data file 3 for a complete description of the
DCA method). S. cerevisiae was used as the 'reference' yeast whereas C. glabrata was used as the 'target' yeast. Eight clusters were obtained after primary
hierarchical clustering using the S. cerevisiae expression profiles. Each cluster was then split into two subclusters (labeled 'a' and 'b') after secondary
hierarchical clustering using the C. glabrata expression profiles. Gene expression profiles are indicated with a color code [80]: green for down-regulated
genes and red for up-regulated genes. Based on the mean correlations between gene expression levels within and between 'a' and 'b' subgroups, eight
conservation clusters were defined: three clusters displaying 'full conservation' (clusters 2, 7 and 8); three clusters displaying 'partial conservation' (clusters
1, 3 and 6); and two clusters displaying 'split conservation' (clusters 4 and 5). The biological relevance of these clusters is discussed in Additional data file 4.
(b) Three pairs of PSAMs identified with the MatrixREDUCE algorithm [31] and that exhibited significant Pearson correlations (r > 0.6) are shown in the
panel on the left. They correspond to specific regulatory sequences that are evolutionarily conserved between S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata. The panel on
the right shows the frequency of occurrence of PSAM in 50 bp windows of the gene clusters identified with the DCA. Background genomic frequency is
indicated in black (dashed line); the frequency in conserved parts of DCA clusters is indicated in red (clusters 1b, 2 and 3b for down-regulated genes, and
clusters 6b, 7 and 8 for up-regulated clusters); and the frequency in non-conserved parts of DCA clusters is indicated in yellow (clusters 1a, 3a and 4 for
down-regulated genes, and clusters 5 and 6a for up-regulated clusters). Together, the DCA and MatrixREDUCE results allowed the identification of a set
of orthologous genes whose expression and regulation is conserved between the two species examined here.

elements in C. glabrata. The TTAGTAA motif was recently
identified as a potential Cgap1p-binding site, based on its

presence in the promoter of the CgFLR1 gene [37]. We analyzed the proportion of YREs in the promoter of genes with
benomyl stress responses dependent on ScYap1p or Cgap1p
(Figure 3b). In S. cerevisiae, the ScYap1p-dependent genes
mainly contained the TTACTAA motif (28%), and its complementary form, TTAGTAA (22%). This finding is consistent

Comparative analysis of Yap1-mediated transcriptional modules
Comparative analysis of Yap1-mediated transcriptional modules. (a) Genes up-regulated during the time course of benomyl treatment were
assigned to two groups as a function of their regulation by the transcription factors ScYap1p in S. cerevisiae (ScYap1p-dependent genes) and Cgap1p in C.
glabrata (Cgap1p-dependent genes). In S. cerevisiae, the ScYap1p transcription factor accounts for 41% of the genes induced during benomyl stress,
whereas, in C. glabrata, the transcription factor Cgap1p accounts for 24% of the genes induced during the benomyl stress response. (b) Eight versions of
the YRE have been described in previous studies (TGACTCA [39], TGACTAA[38], TTACTAA[38], TTAGTAA [37], TTAGTCA[38], TGACAAA[40],
TGAGTAA [40]and TTACAAA [40]). We looked for these motifs in the upstream regions (from nucleotides -600 to -1, direct strand) of up-regulated
genes during the benomyl stress response. The percentages of genes with a YRE in their promoter are shown here. In S. cerevisiae, the motifs TTACTAA
and TTAGTAA appeared to be the more frequent in the promoters of genes regulated by ScYap1p, whereas in C. glabrata, the motifs TTAGTAA and
TTACAAA appeared to be the more frequent in Cgap1p-dependant genes.

major benomyl response element (BRE) for ScYap1p [38].
Different results were obtained for C. glabrata. Indeed, the
Cgap1p-dependant genes still mainly contained TTAGTAA
motifs (15%) but they also contained TTACAAA motifs (15%).
By contrast, the TTACTAA motif - the major BRE in S. cerevisiae - was present in a relatively low number of the promoters
of genes that are regulated by Cgap1p (7%). Finally, a blind

analysis tool of Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tool (RSAT)
[41] also identified TTACAA as the most abundant motif in
Cgap1p targets (data not shown). Together, these observations suggest that, in C. glabrata, the major BRE is TTACAAA
rather than TTA(C/G)TAA. To experimentally verify this
hypothesis, we constructed yeast strains expressing either
ScYap1p (BY4742) or Cgap1p (BYCgAP1) (see Materials and
methods). These strains were transformed with plasmids
containing LacZ as a reporter gene under the control of wildtype or mutated versions of the CgFLR1 promoter (Figure 4a;
and Materials and methods). LacZ expression was measured
by real-time quantitative RT-PCR, before and after benomyl
treatment (20 μg/ml, 40 minutes; Figure 4a). We chose
CgFLR1 as a model target because its induction by benomyl is
entirely dependent on Cgap1p in C. glabrata [37] and because
its promoter contains the two YREs, TTAGTAA (from -373 to
-367) and TTACAAA (from -172 to -166), that are the most
frequent in the promoters of Cgap1p-dependant genes (Figure 3b). We observed that the inactivation of the TTACAAA
motif was sufficient to significantly decrease the benomyl
response of CgFLR1 in the presence of Cgap1p or ScYap1p
(Figure 4a). On the other hand, the inactivation of the motif
TTAGTAA had no effect. Such an observation demonstrated
that, in the context of a C. glabrata promoter (in this case,
CgFLR1), the TTACAAA acts as the major BRE.

Cgap1p and ScYap1p differently 'read' cis-regulatory signals in their
target promoters
The observation that the major BRE has changed between S.
cerevisiae and C. glabrata opened new questions concerning
the binding properties of ScYap1p and Cgap1p. The results
presented in Figure 4a suggest that the TTACAAA motif,
when placed in the natural context of the CgFLR1 promoter,
was interpreted as a BRE by both proteins. We then decided
to test the effect of this sequence on Cgap1p and ScYap1p
activities in the 'heterologous' context of a S. cerevisiae promoter. The BY4742 and BYCgAP1 strains were transformed
with plasmids containing LacZ as a reporter gene under the
control of wild-type or mutated versions of the ScFLR1 promoter. Briefly, three YREs are present in the ScFLR1 promoter, named YRE1-3 (Figure 4b). YRE3 has been shown to
be responsible for most of the benomyl response of ScFLR1,
whereas YRE2 has a minor role and YRE1 no role in this
response [38]. As stated above, only two YREs have been
described in the CgFLR1 promoter. Considering their position from the ATG of the CgFLR1 gene, we called them
CgYRE3 and CgYRE2 (Figure 4a). The sequence of CgYRE3

(TTAGTAA) is very similar to YRE3 (TTACTAA), whereas
CgYRE2 (TTACAAA) is significantly different from both
YRE2 (TGACTAA) and YRE1 (TTAGTCA). We first put LacZ
under the control of a wild-type version of the ScFLR1 promoter, in which we then inactivated all three YREs (see Materials and methods). We then introduced the CgYRE3 and
CgYRE2 sequences in place of the YRE3 and YRE2 sequences,
respectively, and measured the LacZ expression. We
observed two main differences between the activities of the
two transcription factors. First, ScYap1p appeared to be as
efficient at the ScFLR1 as at the CgFLR1 wild-type promoters,
whereas Cgap1p was more efficient at the CgFLR1 promoter
(Figure 4a, b). Second, only the introduction of CgYRE2 was
able to restore the full activity of Cgap1p at the ScFLR1
mutated promoter, whereas the sole introduction of the
CgYRE3 sequence restored half of the ScYap1p activity, and
the addition of the CgYRE2 sequence did not increase this
activity (Figure 4b). In conclusion, in the heterologous context of the ScFLR1 promoter, CgYRE2 is still the main BRE for
Cgap1p, but not for ScYap1p, which prefers CgYRE3, that is,
the reverse complement of YRE3. This may be due to a
sequence or a position effect but, in both cases, it implies that
Cgap1p and ScYap1p, although sharing an affinity for the
YREs of the ScFLR1 and CgFLR1 promoters, exhibited clear
differences in the way they 'read' the cis-regulatory elements
present in their target promoters.

Discussion
A general protocol for comparing gene expression
networks
Comparative analyses of gene expression networks in different organisms are promising for understanding both the
molecular basis of phenotypic diversity and the evolution of
the interactions between genomes and their environment.
One of the main obstacles is the difficulty of comparing data
obtained in different experimental conditions between organisms separated by large evolutionary distances. We propose a
general protocol for studies of the evolution of genetic networks involved in similar biological processes. We optimized
conditions for the integration of expression data into a crossspecies comparison by: choosing species from the same phylum and with a high rate of functional orthologous genes; producing experimental data as comparable as possible between
species; and sequentially applying a set of complementary
bioinformatic approaches to assess the validity of the results
(Additional data file 8). We first performed independent
analyses of the two sets of microarray data obtained for each
species. We carried out PCA to check that the two yeasts displayed comparable transcriptome responses to the benomyl
dose used in this study (Figure 1a, b). We then used DCA [10]
to compare the transcriptional responses in the two yeast species, based on orthology relationships between genes (Figure
2a). It is important to mention that the method used here to
assign orthology links does not really distinguish the 'real'
orthologs from the paralog lists. Therefore, what are called,

Figure 4 comparative analyses of ScYap1p and Cgap1p activities in vivo
Functional(see previous page)
Functional comparative analyses of ScYap1p and Cgap1p activities in vivo. In vivo assays of ScYap1p and Cgap1p properties were conducted,
using S. cerevisiae strains expressing either ScYap1p (purple histograms) or Cgap1p (orange histograms). LacZ was used as a reporter gene and was placed
under the control of wild-type or mutated versions of (a) the CgFLR1 or (b) ScFLR1 promoter regions (see Materials and methods). Descriptions of the
mutations performed in YREs are shown in Additional data file 12. LacZ expression was measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR, before and after
benomyl treatment (20 μg/ml) for 40 minutes. (a) Only the inactivation of CgYRE2 (TTACAAA) dramatically decreased the benomyl response of CgFLR1.
In the context of a C. glabrata promoter (in this case, CgFLR1) TTACAAA acts as the major BRE. (b) The LacZ reporter gene was placed under the control
of the ScFLR1 promoter, in which all three YREs were inactivated and replaced with CgYRE3 and CgYRE2 sequences. To summarize, ScYap1p appeared to
be as efficient at the ScFLR1 and at the CgFLR1 wild-type promoters, whereas Cgap1p was more efficient at the CgFLR1 promoter (a, b). Moreover, only the
introduction of CgYRE2 was able to restore the full activity of Cgap1p at the ScFLR1 mutated promoter, whereas the sole introduction of CgYRE3
sequence restored half of the ScYap1p activity, and the addition of the CgYRE2 sequence did not increase this activity. In the heterologous context of the
ScFLR1 promoter, CgYRE2 is still the main BRE for Cgap1p, but not for ScYap1p, which prefers CgYRE3.

for the sake of simplicity, 'orthologs' in this work, should be
understood as 'likely functional orthologs'. DCA was originally applied to large sets of unrelated microarray data, using
Gene Ontology as a reference for the definition of groups of
genes [10]. We used DCA in a different context; it was applied
to a limited set of experimental conditions, with no functional
assumptions concerning the relationships between genes.
DCA efficiently revealed the structure of the transcriptional
modules involved in the stress response. We therefore aimed
to decipher the underlying regulatory mechanisms, identifying both transcription factors and the associated regulatory
motifs in the promoter sequences of regulated genes. In that
respect, the benefit of the MatrixREDUCE algorithm [42]
relied on possibilities to identify, from a large pool of potential motifs, those best correlated with the expression data, and
motifs common to both yeasts (Figure 2b). Finally, our comparative analysis of Yap1-mediated transcriptional modules
(Figures 3 and 4) allowed us to identify interesting properties
concerning the evolution of the DNA motifs targeted by
ScYap1p (in S. cerevisiae) and Cgap1p (in C. glabrata), and
the DNA binding properties of these two proteins.

Interplay between the conservation of gene expression
patterns and the divergence of regulatory networks
As a case study, we investigated the evolution of the genetic
networks controlling the chemical stress responses of the two
yeast species S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata. Unlike previous
studies of drug responses in pathogenic Candida species [43],
this study focused on C. glabrata rather than Candida albicans, for two reasons: C. glabrata is the second leading causal
agent of candidiasis in humans; and C. glabrata is phylogenetically more closely related to S. cerevisiae than it is to Candida albicans [20]. The use of C. glabrata therefore ensured
clear and extensive sequence homology with the model yeast
S. cerevisiae. Despite a short time delay, our PCA and DCA
analyses indicated that transcriptional responses were quantitatively similar in the two yeasts, with the set of genes
induced or repressed in both species including more than 400
orthologous gene pairs (60% of the entire set of genes
responding to benomyl stress in one or both species). The
transcriptional pathways related to the regulatory motifs
rRPE, PAC and STRE were found to be conserved, whereas
the transcriptional pathway related to the transcription factor

Yap1p appeared to have substantially changed. In S. cerevisiae, the transcription factor ScYap1p controls the expression
of more than 40% of genes up-regulated in the presence of
benomyl and a single deletion of the ScYAP1 gene is sufficient
to abolish this response [26]. In our study, the C. glabrata
ortholog of ScYap1p, Cgap1p, controlled 'only' 25% of the positive response to benomyl. Reconstructing the evolutionary
path of the promoters that 'escaped' the Yap1p regulation in
C. glabrata, we observed a progressive decrease in the
number of these promoters that contained YREs along the
Saccharomyces sensu stricto evolutionary tree, from 100% in
S. cerevisiae down to 50% in S. bayanus (Additional data file
9). Still, 60% of these promoters have one or more YREs and
are actually controlled by the ScYap1p ortholog in the distant
yeast species C. albicans [44]. These observations suggest
that the ancestral regulation of these promoters was dependent on Yap1p. In C. glabrata, other combinations of transcription factors may be involved in the oxidative stress
response of these genes. The Msn2p/Msn4p transcription
factors are good candidates, since a large number of STRE
regulatory motifs were observed in the C. glabrata genes for
which the orthologous genes in S. cerevisiae were ScYap1p
target genes (data not shown). A different sharing of the work
between the seven ScYap1p paralogs, six of which have clear
orthologs in C. glabrata, could also be investigated.
Together with this quantitative decrease of the regulatory role
of Cgap1p, we observed a modification of the Yap1 bindingsite sequences present in the promoters of C. glabrata genes.
Comparative genomics analysis of the YRE in five yeast species (Additional data file 9) showed that the proportions of
most of the S. cerevisiae YRE motifs are gradually decreasing
along the yeast phylogenetic tree, except the TTACAAA and
TGACAAA motifs, whose frequencies were significantly
higher in Candida species (C. glabrata and C. albicans) than
in S. cerevisiae. Our functional analyses confirmed that TTACAAA acts as the major BRE in C. glabrata promoters (Figure
4). Of note, although the alanine spacer and the second basic
cluster of the bZip domain are identical in ScYap1p and
Cgap1p, 50% of amino acids in the first basic cluster are substitutions, some of which may account for differences in the
DNA recognition properties of the two proteins [37].

The complexity of the evolution of the promoters responding
to oxidative stress is nicely exemplified by the ScFLR1 gene
and its orthologs, CgFLR1 in C. glabrata and CaMDR1 in C.
Albicans. Indeed, the FLR1 response to various sources of
oxidative stress, although conserved all along the hemiascomycete tree, relies on different regulatory systems from S.
cerevisiae and C. glabrata, in which the discrimination
between H2O2 and benomyl is based on different cis-regulatory elements used by the same transcription factor (this
study and [38]), to C. albicans, in which the BRE activity has
been transferred to a different regulatory pathway (Additional data file 10) [45,46].

Conclusion

The evolution of transcriptional regulatory networks has
made a major contribution to the diversity of life [47-49].
Work in this field was long restricted to analyses of the regulatory networks controlling development in higher eukaryotes, but the recent sequencing of the genomes of more than
ten yeast species has placed yeasts at the forefront of evolutionary studies [50]. A phylogeny of functionally important
cis-regulatory motifs can be established among closely
related yeast species [19], but the intimate structure of the
promoters and the DNA-binding properties of transcription
factors rapidly diverge. A recent study of the genome-wide
location of binding sites for the transcription factors Ste12
and Tec1 was carried out in three closely related Saccharomyces species and showed that, in this case, the divergence of
transcription factor binding sites was associated with a modification in target gene selection, depending on the physiological conditions (pseudohyphal growth versus mating) [51,52].
Progressive divergence of regulatory networks, together with
major genome rearrangements, such as entire genome duplication events, led, in hemiascomycetes, to considerable
changes in gene expression patterns [53]. However, the divergence of the structure of the regulatory networks is, in many
cases, not accompanied by changes in gene expression. For
example, the logic underlying mating-type (MAT) target gene
regulation is conserved in all hemiascomycetes species examined to date, despite major changes to the regulatory networks controlling MAT gene expression [54]. The control of
proteasome expression illustrates another case in which high
conservation of gene regulation is connected to a high conservation of the regulatory system, with only a subtle divergence
of the corresponding cis-regulatory motifs, which co-evolved
with the Rpn4p transcription factor DNA binding properties
[55]. The case of the oxidative stress response described here
turned out to be intermediate. As for the MAT locus, little
phenotypic divergence was observed in terms of gene expression patterns or gene co-regulation properties. This high conservation deals with a fast divergence of the promoter
sequences, which seems to have been counterbalanced by two
phenomena: the co-evolution of transcription factor binding
properties (for example, differences in the YRE preferred by
ScYap1p and Cgap1p); and the versatility and the fast evolu-

tion of the structure of the transcription regulation networks
(for example, the apparent sharing of Yap1p function between
other transcription factors in C. glabrata). This model was
recently supported by a similar study conducted on the mating/pseudohyphal growth regulation system in yeasts [56]
and by an experimental analysis of Mcm1p genomic binding
loci over three distant yeast species [57]. All these works concluded the occurrence of a very fast divergence of promoter
structure and regulatory network combinatorial circuits,
which created a complex equilibrium between the conservation of essential functions and the emergence of new properties. These observations address the role of the evolution of
transcriptional networks in the adaptation of yeast species to
specific ecological niches. These features could not have been
predicted from genome sequences alone and demonstrate the
need to combine accurate functional genomic analyses and
sequence resources for a larger set of evolutionarily different
organisms.

Materials and methods
Yeast strains, growth conditions and YRE mutagenesis
The S. cerevisiae strain is BY4742 from the Euroscarf collection. The wild-type C. glabrata strain used in the kinetic
experiments was the sequenced strain CBS418. The C. glabrata CgAP1Δ strain and its isogenic wild type were a gift
from J Bennett [37]. The S. cerevisiae strain expressing
Cgap1p in place of ScYap1p was derived from the BY4742
YAP1::KanMX strain (Euroscarf). This strain was transformed with a DNA fragment containing the CgAP1 ORF
fused to the selective marker gene his5 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, flanked by about 40 bp corresponding to the
regions immediately upstream and downstream of the YAP1
ORF, as described previously [58]. The clones having integrated this fragment in place of KanMX were selected on
CSM-HIS plates and controlled by PCR and sequencing. The
CgAP1-his5 fusion was obtained as follows: CgAP1 was amplified by PCR from C. glabrata CBS418 genomic DNA, using
oligonucleotides so that a SacII restriction site was introduced 3'. His5 was amplified by PCR from a plasmid previously described [58], with oligonucleotides so that a SacII
restriction site was introduced 5'. After SacII digestion, the
two PCR fragments were ligated using the Quick Ligation kit
(New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). The cassette for
the chromosomic insertion of CgAP1-his5 was obtained by
PCR using oligonucleotides containing sequences flanking
the YAP1 ORF. The ScFLR1 and CgFLR1 were amplified from
genomic DNA by PCR, using oligonucleotides designed to
introduce Not1 and SacII restriction sites 3' and 5' of the PCR
product, respectively. After Not1 and SacII digestions, these
PCR fragments were cloned in the plasmid pZLG (Garcia et
al., in preparation), which contained lacZ cloned downstream
of the SacII and Not1 sites in the polylinker and the URA3
selective marker gene. The mutagenesis of YRE and CgYRE in
these promoters were conducted using specific oligonucleotides and the QuickChange II Multisite-directed Mutagene-

sis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). All constructs were
controlled by sequencing. All the oligonucleotides used are
described in Additional data file 11. All PCR amplifications
were conducted using the Pfx platinium (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) enzyme and the corresponding protocol.
Cells were grown in YPD rich media (2% glucose, 1% bactopeptone, 1% yeast extract).

Cells were grown to an OD600nm of 0.6 and treated with benomyl (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml (stock solution: 10 mg/ml in DMSO). For
mock treatment, cells were incubated with a similar volume
of DMSO. The cells were snap-frozen in cold ethanol (final
concentration 70% at -80°C) after 2, 4, 10, 20, 40 and 80 minutes of benomyl or mock treatment. RNA was extracted as
previously described [26]. Total RNA (10 μg) was used for fluorescent cDNA synthesis according to the amino-allyl protocol. The labeled cDNA was purified and hybridization carried
out according to the protocol available from [59]. At least
three independent experiments were performed for each time
point, using dye switching techniques. The budding yeast
arrays were custom-made and contained probes for all yeast
ORFs, spotted in duplicate onto Corning Ultragap
slides(Corning, NY, USA). The Candida arrays were obtained
from the Pasteur Institute and contained probes for most of
the ORFs from C. glabrata, spotted singly onto Corning
Ultragap slides at the transcriptome platform [60]. Note that
all the microarray data have also been submitted to the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database [61]. The accession
number is GSE10244.

Complete genome sequences for S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata
were downloaded from the Saccharomyces Genome Database [67,68] and Génolevures [69,70] websites, respectively.
Promoter sequences located upstream from the ORF were
obtained with RSA tools [71] available from [72]. Upstream
regions from -600 bases to -1 base were used for regulatory
motif searches, by analysis of the direct strand of DNA.

Image analyses and data processing
The microarrays were read with a Genepix 4000B scanner
(Axon. Downingtown, PA, USA) and analyzed with Genepix
6.0 software. Artifactual and saturated signal spots were
eliminated. After image quantification, data were normalized
over all features with print-tip lowess, using the R/BioConductor packages 'limma' and 'marray' available from [62].
Expression values for replicated spots on the array were averaged. The SAM algorithm [29] in the 'samr' package of R [63]
was used to identify genes displaying a change in expression
over time, using an equivalent false discovery rate (less than
5%) for all time points. As an additional filter, only genes with
smooth expression profiles were retained. These genes displayed a significant change in expression over at least two
successive time points. Gene expression patterns with more
than two missing values (33%) were also excluded from subsequent analysis. The remaining missing values were
replaced by the KNN-imputation [64] method, with the K
parameter fixed at 30, as recommended by de Brevern et al.
[65].

Real-time, quantitative RT-PCR analyses were carried out
exactly as described previously [66], using a Light Cycler 480
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland). All the experiments were duplicated, using independent clones to average clone-specific
effects. ACT1 was used as a reference. The sequences of the
oligonucleotides used are available in Additional data file 11.

Orthology assignments
Orthology relationships were inferred between S. cerevisiae
and C. glabrata genes using the INPARANOID algorithm
[30,73] with the default parameters. This algorithm begins by
calculating all pairwise similarity scores between the complete sets of protein sequences from the two genomes, using
BLAST [74]. The sequence pairs with the best mutual hits are
then detected and serve as central points around which additional orthologs from both species are clustered. Finally,
overlapping groups are resolved.

MatrixREDUCE algorithm
We used the MatrixREDUCE algorithm [31,42] to detect significant PSAMs in promoter sequences. MatrixREDUCE
infers the sequence specificity of a transcription factor
directly from genome-wide transcription factor occupancy
data by fitting a statistical mechanical model for transcription
factor-DNA interaction. The source code is freely available
online from [75] and was used for analyses of upstream
sequences from positions -600 to -1, searching for 1-7 bp
motifs (see the documentation available online for more
information).

Principal component analysis
PCA is a multivariate statistical method allowing a large
number of sample datasets to be described in terms of much
smaller numbers of principal components, each of which
accounts for significant variability in the data but is not correlated with any other component. A complete interpretation
of the biplots, given different transformations of the data
expression matrix, can be found elsewhere [76]. The analysis
was carried out in the statistical computing and graphics
environment R [77].

Measurement of similarity between gene expression profiles
Methods for analyzing expression data are often based on the
implicit hypothesis that genes with similar functions have
similar expression profiles across a set of conditions [78]. For

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R164

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/11/R164

Genome Biology 2008,

computational analysis, it is necessary to transform the intuitive notion of 'similarity' into quantitative measures. Classically, a distance measured between gene expression profiles
is applied [79]. In this study, we used 'Euclidian distance' to
assess the relationship between two gene expression profiles.
If we denote two sets of measurements xi and yi, where i is an
index from microarray experiment 1 to n, the Euclidean distance between the two profiles X and Y is given by the following equation:
n

d( X , Y ) =

∑( x − y )
i

i

2

i =1

The Euclidean distance takes a value between 0 and + ∞;. A
value of 0 means that the two profiles are perfectly superimposed.

Hierarchical clustering
The hierarchical clustering procedure has been described in
detail elsewhere [79]. It can be summarized by the following
five steps: step 1, distances between all genes pairs are calculated, using Euclidean distance, for example (see the previous
paragraph); step 2, the resulting distance matrix is thoroughly inspected to find the smallest distance between
expression profiles; step 3, the corresponding genes are
joined together in the tree and form a new cluster; step 4, the
distances between the newly formed cluster and the other
genes are recalculated; step 5, steps 2, 3 and 4 are repeated
until all genes and clusters are linked in a final tree. We used
the 'hclust' function, available in the R programming language, with the 'ward' method for gene agglomeration. Hierarchical clustering results were visualized by representing the
ordered expression profiles with a color code [80]: green for
negative expression measurements (down-regulated genes)
and red for positive expression values (up-regulated genes).

Differential clustering algorithm
The DCA was first described by Ihmels et al. [10] and the
underlying principle is illustrated in Additional data file 3. We
applied the DCA to orthologous gene pairs defined by INPARANOID. Genes belonging to one of the two species (the 'reference' yeast) were first classified using the hierarchical
clustering method described above. This generated clusters of
genes coexpressed in the reference yeast but not necessarily
in the other yeast (the 'target' yeast). We then reordered the
orthologous counterparts of the genes within each coexpressed cluster in the target yeast using a secondary hierarchical clustering step. DCA results are presented as
rearranged distance matrices for each yeast species, with
lines and columns ordered according to primary and secondary clustering results. These matrices are of the same dimension (that is, the number of orthologous genes) and are
composed of all pairwise distances between gene expression
profiles, represented using the following color code: red for
small distances (that is, gene pairs strongly coexpressed) and

Volume 9, Issue 11, Article R164

Lelandais et al. R164.13

yellow for large distances (that is, gene pairs weakly coexpressed). Finally, the distance matrices were combined into a
single matrix, in which each triangle corresponded to one of
the distance matrices. This ingenious graphical representation facilitates the intuitive extraction of differences and similarities in the coexpression patterns of the two yeasts,
resulting in the definition of four categories of gene clusters:
full, partial, split or no conservation of expression. Labels for
cluster conservation are based on three correlation measures
(Ca, Cb, and Cab), corresponding to the mean correlations of
genes within secondary clusters 'a' (Ca) and 'b' (Cb) in the target yeast (see main text) and between these clusters (Cab). If
Ca, Cb and Cab are higher than a threshold T chosen heuristically (T = 0.3 in this study), the cluster is considered to display full conservation; if (Ca and Cb) > T and Cab < T, the
cluster is considered to display split conservation; if (Ca or Cb)
> T, the cluster is considered to display partial conservation;
and, if (Ca and Cb) < T, the cluster is considered to display no
conservation. The R programming language [77] was used for
the DCA approach and graphical representation.
