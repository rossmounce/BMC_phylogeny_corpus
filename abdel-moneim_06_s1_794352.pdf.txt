Abstract
Background: Infectious bronchitis is highly contagious and constitutes one of the most common
and difficult poultry diseases to control. IBV is endemic in probably all countries that raise chickens.
It exists as dozens of serotypes/genotypes. Only a few amino acid differences in the S1 protein of
vaccine and challenge strains of IBV may result in poor protection. Tropism of IBV includes the
respiratory tract tissues, proventriculus and caecal tonsils of the alimentary tract, the oviduct and
the kidney.
Results: Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain closely related to Massachusetts (Mass) serotype
was isolated from broiler chickens suffering from severe renal and respiratory distresses. The
isolate was serologically identified by Dot-ELISA and further characterized by RT-PCR then
genotyped using S1 gene sequence analysis. Alignment of the S1 sequence of the isolate with 16 IBV
strains revealed high homology to isolates related to Mass serotype. Inoculation with the strain
reproduced the disease in experimental 1-day-old chickens and resulted in 20% mortality, severe
renal and moderate respiratory distresses. Marked histopathological changes in both kidney and
trachea were observed in experimentally infected chickens. A protection study using the H120 live
attenuated vaccine showed low protection rate in spite of high S1 sequence homology (97%).
Protection based criteria were: virus re-isolation attempts from trachea, tracheal and renal
histopathology as well as IBV antigens detection by immunofluorescent antibody technique in
kidney sections.
Conclusion: Periodical evaluation of cross-protective capabilities of IBV vaccine(s) versus recently
recovered field isolates should be performed to ensure optimum control of IBV.

Background
Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a highly contagious pathogen of chickens that replicates primarily in the
respiratory tract and also in some epithelial cells of the

gut, kidney and oviduct [1]. IBV is a virus member of
genus Coronavirus, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales [2]. The virus possesses a positive stranded RNA
genome that encodes phosphorylated nucleocapsid proPage 1 of 9

tein (N), membrane glycoprotein (M), spike glycoprotein
(S) and small membrane protein (E). The spike glycoprotein is post-translationally cleaved into two subunits, S1
and S2 [1,3]. The S1 protein forms the N-terminal portion
of the peplomer and contains antigenic epitopes mainly
within three HVRs [4-6]. Neutralizing and serotype specific epitopes are associated within the defined HVRs
[4,7,8].
Variation in S1 sequences [9-11], has been recently used
for distinguishing between different IBV serotypes. Diversity in S1 probably results from mutation, recombination
and strong positive selection in vivo [12]. Antigenically
different serotypes and newly emerged variants from field
chicken flocks sometimes cause vaccine breaks. The generation of genetic variants is thought to be resulted from few
amino acid changes in the spike (S) glycoprotein of IBV
[13,14].
In Egypt, isolates related to Massachusetts, D3128, D274,
D-08880, 4/91 and the novel genotype; Egypt/Beni-Suef/
01 were isolated from different poultry farms [15-18]. The
commonly used IBV attenuated vaccine is H120 while the
Mass 41 (M41) strain is commonly used in inactivated
vaccines.
In the present study, Egypt/F/03 was isolated from 25day-old broiler chickens in Fayoum Governorate, identified by Dot-ELISA, RT-PCR and sequenced to determine
its serotype. Pathogenicity test to 1-day-old chickens and
protection afforded by the commonly used H120 live
attenuated vaccine were also performed.

Results
Virus isolation and serological identification
The allantoic fluid of the first chicken embryo passage of
Egypt/F/03 was harvested at 48 h PI. Four additional egg
passages were performed. Five eggs of the 4th passage were
incubated till being 18-day-old and all of them (100%)
showed typical lesions of the IBV (stunting and dwarfing).
The virus identity was ascertained by performing DotELISA on the CAM homogenate (Fig. 1).

Polymerase chain reaction and S1 gene cycle sequencing
RT-PCR of Egypt/F/03 resulted in a product of 1600 base
pairs using S1 primers OLIGO 5' and OLIGO 3'. Egypt/F/
03 is closely related to the Beaudette US reference strain;
98% nucleotide identity and 96% amino acid identity
(Table 1 and Fig. 2). It showed 97% similarities both in
nucleotides and amino acids to H120 and 98% nucleotide
and 96% amino acid homology to M41(Table 1). Egypt/
F/03 showed 34 point mutations from H120; 20 silent
and 14 non silent mutations. On the other hand, it
showed 30 point mutations; 10 silent and 20 non silent
mutations from M41 (Fig. 3, 4). Sixteen potential glycosylation sites were found in Egypt/F/03 while 17 were
found in H120 and M41 (Fig. 4). All potential glycosylation sites found in Egypt/F/03 were shared with those
found in H120 and M41(Fig. 4).
Virulence test
Chickens inoculated with Egypt/F/03 exhibited snicking
and rales in approximately 50% of infected birds at 3rd day
of inoculation. Conjunctivitis was observed in 20/30 at
3rd day PI that was elevated to 22/30 by the 5th day PI of
infected birds whereas no birds exhibited watery eyes. Six
birds were dead after Egypt/F/03 experimental infection; 4
birds in the 7th day PI and 2 birds in the 8th day PI. Postmortem examination of dead birds, revealed petechial
haemorrhages in larynx and thymus, severe congestion of
liver, spleen and lungs as well as renal haemorrhages.
These changes appeared but in milder form in birds sacrificed at 5 days PI. Histopathological examination of sacrificed birds at 5 days PI and freshly dead birds at 7 days PI
revealed mucus, marked loss of cilia, desquamation,
mononuclear infiltration, epithelial hyperplasia and vascular congestion of the trachea (Fig. 5). Kidneys showed
severe changes including haemorrhages, degenerative
changes in renal tubules and hypercellularity of the renal
glomeruli as well as focal lymphocytic infiltration (Fig. 5).
In general the tracheal and renal histopathological lesions
were more severe in dead birds (Fig. 5b, d) than birds sacrificed at 5 days PI (Fig. 5a, c).
Vaccination trial
Chickens vaccinated with H120 (Group A) showed 58.3%
protection (7/12) by virus reisolation procedure and
66.6% (8/12) protection by histopathology after challenge with Egypt\F/03 while all control unvaccinated
birds (Group B) were not protected (5/5) (Table 2). On
day four PI, the kidneys of (3/12) birds in group A (vaccinated and challenged with IBV) showed focal lymphocytic infiltration, urates deposition and degenerative
changes in renal tubules while birds of group B (unvaccinated and challenged with IBV) showed multifocal lymphocytic infiltration, urates deposition and degenerative
changes in renal tubules in 4/5 birds, while only focal
lymphocytic infiltration, urates deposition and degenera-

tive changes in renal tubules were observed in 1/5 birds.
Birds in group C (vaccinated unchallenged group) did not
show any abnormalities (0/12) either in tracheae or kidneys. Immunofluorescenct assay on kidneys of challenged
and unchallenged groups showed that all challenged
unvaccinated and 3/12 of challenged vaccinated groups
possessed kidney immunofluorescence. None of control
unchallenged groups possessed kidney immunofluorescence (Table 2).

Discussion
In this study, an Egyptian IBV strain; Egypt\F/03 was isolated from a tissue pool of kidney and trachea from unvaccinated broiler flock with a history of respiratory and renal
disease. The strain produced typical lesions of IBV in inoculated embryos and identified as IBV by Dot-ELISA and
RT-PCR. The isolate was found to be devoid of major concomitant viruses; avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease
virus, infectious laryngotracheitis virus, reovirus and adenovirus (data not shown).

It is known that the most severe clinical response of IBV
appears in very young chickens and severity is alleviated in
older chickens [19,20]. This fact explains the high mortality rate observed in 1-day-old chickens that experimentally inoculated with Egypt/F/03 compared to mortality
pattern in the original flock (25-day-old chickens). The
presence of acute interstitial nephritis on days 5 and 7
post infection indicated that Egypt\F\03 is a nephrogenic
IBV. The microscopic findings of the renal tubules
matched the general findings recorded with nephrogenic
IBV strains [21,22]. The microscopic findings in tracheal
sections appeared similar to those recorded by [19,21]
including: loss of cilia, degenerative changes of the tracheal mucosa, irregular loss of epithelium, desquamation

of the sloughed epithelium in the tracheal lumen and
lymphocytic infiltration that ranged from focal aggregation to diffuse massive infiltration. Severe renal haemorrhages observed grossly and in hisopathological sections
of birds dead after experimental infection with Egypt/F/03
denote that deaths resulted from acute renal failure. Our
finding regarding the presence of petechial haemorrhages
in larynx and thymus as well as severe congestion of liver,
spleen and lungs in birds dead after IBV experimental
infection is in agreement with [23,24] who confirmed the
presence of IBV viral antigens in such organs.
Evaluation of the immune response to IBV vaccination is
based on several criteria including: clinical signs, tracheal

histological lesion, virus neutralization, virus re-isolation
from trachea, antigen detection in trachea and/or kidney
by immunofluorescent or immunoperoxidase techniques
[25-29]. In this study we used tracheal histological lesion
and virus re-isolation as parameters for tracheal protection. Kidney histopathology and antigen detection by IFA
were used as indicators of kidney protection. Complete
protection is expected upon using closely related vaccine
strain as the degree of cross protection among IBV strains
generally reflects the similarities between the S proteins
[12,30]. The re-isolation of Egypt/F/03 from the trachea of
vaccinated birds and the presence of tracheal and renal
microscopic lesions as well as viral antigen in kidneys (by
IFA) in H120 vaccinated birds denote lack of complete
protection afforded by H120 vaccination.
H120 is a mild vaccine and it is possible that the challenge
virus was too virulent for the level of immunity that the
vaccine produced in these young chickens. Other possible
consideration includes that baby chickens are not fully
immunocompetent at one-day of age, the time that they
were vaccinated for the protection study experiment.
However, commercial broiler chickens possess maternally
derived antibodies, are routinely vaccinated at one-day of
age [31,32] without apparent interference by the maternal
derived antibodies in the development of active immunity, at least in the respiratory tract that measured by challenge [33]. On the other hand, variable results were
recorded regarding homologous protection of IBV. Cavanagh et al. [12] inoculated groups of 10 chickens with the
virulent UK/6/82 isolate and challenged with isolates that
differed by up to 4% of S1 amino acids. Challenge with
two variants (98% S1 identity with UK/6/82) resulted in
challenge scores virtually the same as with the homologous challenge however, challenge with two others iso-

lates (96% and 98% S1 identity, respectively), resulted in
less cross-protection, although the numbers were not statistically significantly different.
In the S1 subunit, three HVRs are located within amino
acids 38â67, 91â141 and 274â387 [4-6]. HVR1 and
HVR2 contain sequences that have been associated with
specific IBV serotypes [34,35] as well as serotype specific
neutralizing epitopes [4,5,14]. IBV serotypes commonly
differ by 20 to 25% in S1 [11,36] but some serotypes differ
in S1 by as little as 2% [13]. Although H120 showed 97%
amino acid and nucleotide identity to Egypt/F/03, it possesses 34 different nucleotides that resulted in 14 amino
acid substitutions. Among such amino acids, one is
located in HVR1, four in HVR2 and one in HVR3 (Fig.4).
The region between amino acid residues 123â152 has
been previously identified as a possible region involved in
the differing pathogenicity of Gray and non-virulent JMK
strains [37]. Egypt/F/03 possesses different amino acid;
phenylalanine within this region at positions 130 and 141
instead of serine and leucine in H120 respectively. It is apt
to mention that some serotypes differ in S1 by as little as
10 amino acids [13], suggesting that only a few epitopes
may induce most of the VN antibody [38].

Conclusion
Egypt/F/03 is a nephropathogenic IBV strain closely
related to Mass serotype. Vaccination by H120 did not
provide satisfactory protection against challenge with
Egypt/F/03. Complete protection of trachea against the
Egypt/F/03 and consequently efficient prevention of kidney infection may be quite feasible upon development of
safe attenuated vaccines based on indigenous field strain.
Preparation of live and inactivated vaccines from indigenous isolates should parallel periodic evaluation of cross-

protective capabilities of such vaccine(s) versus recently
recovered field isolates in order to ensure optimum control of IBV.

Methods
Embryonated chicken eggs
SPF ECE obtained from Nile SPF (Koom Oshiem, Fayoum, Egypt) were used for isolation of the field isolate,
serial passages, titration of the seed stocks of Egypt/F/03
and vaccine strain (H120), as well as virus re-isolation
attempts following challenge in the protection study.
Chickens
Sixty nine commercial 1-day-old chickens (El-Waddi Co,
Egypt) were reared under strict hygienic conditions in sep-

Clinical history
Infectious bronchitis was diagnosed during Augest 2003
in Fayoum Governorate, Egypt. The outbreak occurred in
25-day-old commercial broiler farm with no previous IBV
vaccination. The flock was vaccinated against Newcastle
disease and infectious bursal disease viruses at 14 and 18
days of age respectively. The total flock density was 3000
birds. The first signs were depression and respiratory distresses including sneezing, coughing and rales. Other
signs included conjunctivitis and watery eyes. Within a
period of 10 days after the appearance of the disease, the
mortality rate increased to 10% of the flock density. Postmortem examination of dead birds revealed increased tracheal mucus, severe renal congestion, urates filled ureters
as well as congestion in liver and spleen.
Virus isolation and passage in SPF ECE
Egypt/F/03 was isolated from 25-day-old broiler chickens
suffering from both respiratory and renal distresses from
Fayoum Governorate in 2003. A kidney homogenate
(10% in sterile PBS) and a tracheal scraping suspension
were pooled, centrifuged at 500 Ã g for 10 min. The supernatant fluid was inoculated into chorioallantoic sac of 10day-old SPF ECE. Allantoic fluid was harvested after 48 h
and was used for re-passage into ECE. Five eggs of the 4th
egg passage were incubated till being 18-day-old and
examined for typical lesions of IBV (stunting, curling and
urates deposition in ureters).
Dot-ELISA for virus identification
A Dot-ELISA was performed according to [39]. Briefly,
NCM of convenient size was cut, marked with waterproof
ink for identification and then soaked for 10 min. in distilled water. NCM was laid on absorbent paper and airdried for 5 min. Three Î¼l of CAM homogenate of the 4th
virus passage of Egypt/F/03, positive control (CAM
homogenate 48 h after inoculation of H120 vaccine) and
negative control (normal CAM homogenate) samples
were applied as small spots on the membrane. The dotted
membrane was allowed to air dry for 15 min then blocked
for 30 min. in Tris buffer (20 mM Tris base, 500 mM NaCl
pH 7.5) containing 0.5% Tween 20 then rinsed for 5 min.
in Tris buffer. NCM was then incubated for 1 h with rabbit
anti-IBV (prepared previously in our lab.) predilluted to
1:10 with diluents buffer (Tris buffer containing 0.05%

Tween20). Bound antibodies were detected by incubating
NCM for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit peroxidase conjugate
(Sigma, Co.) prediluted to 1:500 with diluent buffer.
NCM was rinsed three times (10 min. each) with Tris
buffer after each step. Finally the membrane was incubated for 15 min. in 60 mm Petri dish containing 20 ml
4-chloro-1-naphthol and hydrogen peroxide substrate
working solution. The membrane was rinsed with water to
stop the enzymatic reaction. Blue dots denote positive
reaction.
Viral inactivation, polymerase chain reaction and S1 gene
cycle sequencing
Egypt/F/03 was inactivated by treating 2 ml of the infective allantoic fluids with an equal volume of molecular
biology grade phenol (pH 4.3) (Fisher Scientific, Fair
Lawn, NJ). Following inactivation, the isolate was shipped
to the University of Delaware as stipulated by an USDA
Veterinary Import Permit issued to J. Gelb, Jr. The phenoltreated allantoic fluid was vortexed and then centrifuged
at 12,000 Ã g for 3 min. The supernatant was harvested
and an additional treatment using phenol/chloroform/
isoamyl alcohol (pH 4.3) (Fisher Scientific) was performed. Viral RNA was harvested from the aqueous layer
and extracted using a Qiagen Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Inc., Valencia, CA). The RNA was eluted in sterile diethyl
pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water and stored at -70Â°C.
RT was performed on the viral RNA using the GeneAmp
RNA PCR Core Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Approximately 2 Î¼l of the extracted viral RNA was used to
synthesize cDNA. Amplification of the S1 gene was performed using S1OLIGO3' (5'-CATAACTAACATAAGGGCAA-3')
and
S1OLIGO5'
(5'TGAAACTGAACAAAAGAC-3') primers [10,37]. PCR of S1

gene was performed as described [11] with the exception
that extension was performed at 60Â°C.
S1 PCR product was cut from 1.8% agarose gels, purified
with the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Inc.) and the
DNA was quantitated as described [11]. Purified RT-PCR
product was sequenced in the forward and reverse directions using the same primers. Sequencing was performed
as described [11].
Sequence analysis
A BLASTÂ® analysis [40] was initially performed using the
S1 sequence of Egypt/F/03 (DQ487085) to establish its
identity to GenBank accessions. A comparative analysis of
S1 sequences was performed using the CLUSTAL W Multiple Sequence Alignment Program, version 1.83 [41]. The
tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining program
[41]. IBV S1 sequences representative to genotypes used
for the alignments were obtained from the GenBank and
EMBL database. They include: Egypt/Beni-Suef/01
(AF395531), Egypt/D/89 (DQ487086) H120(M21970),

F/03 was compared with H120 and M41 vaccine
sequences using multisequence alignment [42] and
sequences were presented using BOXSHADE 3.21 [43].
Virulence test
Forty 1-day-old chickens were used. Thirty chickens were
infected by intraocular instillation of 105 EID50/100 Î¼l of

Egypt/F/03 according to [21] while other birds were kept
as control uninfected group. Clinical signs and gross postmortem lesions as well as mortalities were recorded.
Microscopic examinations of both tracheae and kidneys
were performed at 5 and 7 days post infection.
Protection study
Twenty nine commercial 1-day-old chickens were used to
evaluate the protection provided by H120 vaccination
against challenge with Egypt/F/03. Birds were divided into
three groups; A (n = 12), B (n = 5), C (n = 12). Vaccination
was performed at day 1 by eye drop application. Single
dose of H120 vaccine (Nobilis, Intervet, The Netherlands
BV) was used for each bird in groups A and C according to
manufacturer's instructions while birds in group B were
kept as unvaccinated control. Four weeks post vaccination, chickens in group A and B were challenged by eye
drop with Egypt/F/03 (105 EID50 per bird) while birds in
group C were not challenged and kept as vaccinated
unchallenged control. Tracheae of all birds from all
groups were collected four days post challenge for virus
reisolation attempts and histopathological examination.
Tracheal scrapings were emulsified in 2 ml of sterile PBS
and centrifuged at 500 Ã g for 3 min. Virus reisolation
attempts were performed by inoculating 2â3, 10-day-old
SPF ECE by the supernatant fluid of each sample as
described [44]. Embryos were examined for typical lesions
of IBV. For histopathological examination, tracheae were
fixed in formalin, processed routinely for histopathology
and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. The trachea
from each bird was examined microscopically and
assigned lesion scores of 0â3 with 0 = none, 1 = focal, 2 =
multifocal, 3 = diffuse. Tracheae were scored for the
amount of mucous, loss of cilia, epithelial hyperplasia,
necrosis, lymphocyte and heterophil infiltrations as well
as the extent of tissue reaction. The scores for each bird
were added and the mean score for the birds in each group
was calculated [45]. Kidney samples were also taken 4
days post challenge and examined microscopically for
tubular degeneration and inflammation consistent with
interstitial nephritis. Focal, multifocal and diffuse were
used to assign kidney histopathology. The presence of
viral antigens in kidneys was screened by immunofluorescent antibody technique.
Indirect immunofluorescent antibody technique (IFA)
It was performed according to [46] to detect viral antigens
in the kidneys of birds after challenge with Egypt/F/03 in
protection study. Briefly, deparaffinized slides were incubated with rabbit anti-IBV antibodies (1:5) for 1 h and
subsequently with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg,
Md.) (1:1000) for 1 h. Both primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS. Slides were rinsed three times
(10min./single wash) with PBS after each step. Slides were

then mounted using glycerol/PBS (without allowing the
slides to dry) and examined under fluorescent microscopy.
