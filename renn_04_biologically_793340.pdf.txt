Abstract
Background: Unravelling the path from genotype to phenotype, as it is influenced by an
organism's environment, is one of the central goals in biology. Gene expression profiling by means
of microarrays has become very prominent in this endeavour, although resources exist only for
relatively few model systems. As genomics has matured into a comparative research program,
expression profiling now also provides a powerful tool for non-traditional model systems to
elucidate the molecular basis of complex traits.
Results: Here we present a microarray constructed with ~4500 features, derived from a brainspecific cDNA library for the African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni (Perciformes). Heterologous
hybridization, targeting RNA to an array constructed for a different species, is used for eight
different fish species. We quantified the concordance in gene expression profiles across these
species (number of genes and fold-changes). Although most robust when target RNA is derived
from closely related species (<10 MA divergence time), our results showed consistent profiles for
other closely related taxa (~65 MA divergence time) and, to a lesser extent, even very distantly
related species (>200 MA divergence time).
Conclusion: This strategy overcomes some of the restrictions imposed on model systems that
are of importance for evolutionary and ecological studies, but for which only limited sequence
information is available. Our work validates the use of expression profiling for functional genomics
within a comparative framework and provides a foundation for the molecular and cellular analysis
of complex traits in a wide range of organisms.

Background
The expression activities of all the genes represented in an
organism's genome at any given time constitute a complex
phenotype that is closely connected with, but not solely
dependent upon, the genotype. In fact, gene expression
profiles represent the primary level of integration between
environmental factors and the genome, providing the
basis for protein synthesis which ultimately guides the
implementation of complex macro-phenotypes such as

morphology and behaviour. Therefore, by comparing
gene expression profiles of different strains, populations,
or even species, one can directly study the molecular basis
of phenotypic variation. This comparative approach has
recently been employed in expression profiling of model
organisms such as Drosophila and S. cerevisiae, unveiling
surprising patterns of sex-driven evolution and providing
insights into the genetics of population-level variation in
adaptive traits ([1-5]). Similarly, across-species

comparisons of expression profiles between human and
non-human primates have been used to test hypotheses
about the functional complexity of the human brain ([68]).
Although it has become increasingly clear that genomics
research benefits from such a comparative outlook, whole
genome sequences are available for only a few of the less
traditional model systems (e.g. Fugu ([9]; Anopheles [10];
dog [11]; honey bee [12]). Given the current DNA microarray technologies (long or short oligonucleotide arrays
and cDNA arrays), which allow simultaneous monitoring
of thousands of genes, the PCR amplified cDNA array is
the most accessible for studies in non-model organisms
(but see [6] for oligonucleotide strategies). The construction of a cDNA microarray is not limited by the need for
probe design based on advanced bioinformatics analysis
of genome sequences only available for genetic "model
organisms" (e.g., [12-14]). Due to the length of the probes
(which are often full-length), it has been suggested that
cDNA microarrays can also be used in heterologous
hybridizations across strains and even relatively closely
related species as long as sequence divergence is limited
for a given gene [15]. This approach has been used successfully, if only occasionally, to study the molecular basis
of traits not present in traditional model species (e.g.
hibernation, [16]). Heterologous hybridization offers a
promising approach to study molecular mechanisms in
species for which a wealth of ecological data as well as natural phenotypic and genetic variation are already available. As research areas such as ecophysiology ([17-19]) as
well as ecology and evolution ([20-22]) are now merging
with functional genomics ([23]; reviewed in [24]) the
technique of heterologous hybridization will become
more prominent. While the feasibility of this technique
has been indirectly suggested, [15] its potential has not
been systematically tested using a biologically meaningful
approach over a wide range of species.
In this paper we quantify the utility of a microarray constructed from an African cichlid fish cDNA library to study
expression profiling in other fish species through the use
of heterologous hybridization. We not only test RNA
hybridization from closely related cichlids but also from
more distantly related species of teleost fishes, a group
that represents more than half of living vertebrates [25].
Our results demonstrate that heterologous microarray
hybridization can yield biologically meaningful data even
in relatively distantly related species and establish this
technique as a tool for comparative functional genomics
in organisms not previously open to an integrative molecular analysis.
The rapid, recent, and repeated radiation of the cichlid
fishes in East Africa's Great Lakes has produced a system

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/42

especially amenable to this approach. Each of the Great
Lakes -Victoria, Tanganyika, and Malawi- boasts hundreds
of phenotypically diverse endemic cichlid species, evolved
from one or a few common ancestors in very recent evolutionary history ([26-30]) and thus sharing highly similar
genomic sequence. The astonishing variation in phenotype at the morphological and behavioural level ([3138]), both within and among cichlid species has likely
contributed to the evolutionary success of this group
([39,40]). Therefore, through heterologous hybridization,
a genomic approach can be used to uncover the molecular
basis and the evolution of these complex traits.

Results
Characterization of the cichlid fish cDNA array
As our study presents the first use of this cDNA microarray
to determine gene expression in the brain of multiple
cichlids species, we first characterized this tool. This array
was originally built using anonymous clones from a brain
cDNA library for the African cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni.
Sequencing is being done in parallel with initial experiments. The gel electrophoretic analysis of PCR products
performed during array construction identified reactions
that either had failed to produce a product or had produced more than one product. From this we concluded
that 4570 amplified cDNAs were reliably represented on
the array. For these, the initial 5' sequencing returned
sequence for eighty-six percent (3936) of the clones (Genbank CN468542 – CN472211 for clones > 150 bp). Sixtyfour percent (2462) of the EST's represented unique
sequences ("singletons") and the remaining 37% could be
aligned to 575 EST clusters, predicting that up to 3000
unique genes may be represented on this array. Approximately 40% of the different genes showed significant
homology to proteins predicted from the Fugu genome
([41], Salzburger et al., in prep.)

Self-hybridization experiments, in which two samples of
the platform species A. burtoni genomic DNA were competitively hybridized, revealed that 93% (mean = 4264 +
SD 229; n = 6) of the features on the array could be
hybridized at a fluorescent intensity at least two standard
deviations above mean background intensity. Signal
intensities for the 635 nm and 532 nm channels were
highly correlated in these experiments (r = 0.991 same
DNA isolation, r = 0.941 same animal but different DNA
isolation, r = 0.974 two different animals, all p < 0.0001)
indicating that technical variability – due to differences in
DNA source, isolation, and fluorescent labelling – was
very low. These results suggest that the majority of the A.
burtoni library spots will provide reliable data.
Self-hybridization experiments, where two samples of
RNA from a pool of several A. burtoni brains were competitively hybridized, revealed that ~94% of the features on

the array (4316+SD 431; n = 10) represent genes that are
expressed at detectable levels using a whole brain strategy.
Again, signal intensities for the 635 nm and 532 nm channels were highly correlated in these experiments (r = 0.974
– 0.997 all p < 0.0001) indicating that technical variability
due to Cy3 or Cy5 labelling is very low.
Establishing a reference profile in A. burtoni
In order to evaluate the sensitivity and consistency of heterologous hybridization for several species on this array
platform, we first devised a direct comparison experiment
to maximize expression differences within A. burtoni, the
species from which the array was built. These results provide a reference for the evaluation of the heterologous
hybridization results presented below. As a large percentage of a genome's protein-coding genes are expressed in
the brain ([42,43]), we expected this microarray to be useful for expression profiling in other tissues. Therefore,
brain-derived RNA was competitively hybridized against
mixed-tissue RNA (skin, muscle, blood vessels) extracted
from the same individual. The distinct nature of these tissues predicts a dramatic difference in the expression of a
large number of genes. Four replicates from each of two
individual A. burtoni (one adult and one juvenile) were
used to identify consistent gene expression differences
between the two tissues, independent of age and reproductive status. 88% of the A. burtoni microarray probes
hybridized above the background cut-off (4165+SD 421,
n = 8).

Analysis of each A. burtoni individual transcription profile
revealed spots that showed significant up-regulation (in a
wide range of fold-differences) in the brain as compared
to mixed-muscle (n = 1146 and 920, respectively). Due to
the variability among animals (adult and juvenile), the
number of significantly regulated spots identified by
increasing only technical replicates was greater than the
number identified by the same absolute number of arrays
involving biological replicates (data not shown). We identified 804 spots that showed consistent up-regulation in
the brain of both A. burtoni individuals and used this core
set as the reference for the heterologous hybridization
experiments (Figure 1).
The inclusion of replicate spots in microarray construction provides a standard for internal control, and
increased confidence in the estimation of differential regulation for these spots. Based on the sequence information (available for 656 of the 804 spots) we estimated that
this reference set contains a total of 472 genes. 41 of these
genes are represented by three or more cDNAs (173 spots
total). We find greater than 75% concordant regulation
across representative spots (at least three out of four
clones or all three for those clusters which contain only
three clones) for 27 of these genes. Concordance smaller

than 75% could be caused by (i) hybridization failure
(due to low probe concentration), (ii) improper assignment of clones to genes, (iii) sequencing errors, (iv) alternative splicing, (v) chance (false negatives).
Heterologous hybridization
We used the same brain vs. body intra-species experimental design to test the hypothesis that hybridization of heterologous RNA to the array can yield biologically
meaningful results. We chose two other cichlid species
endemic to Lake Tanganyika, Enantiopus melanogenys and
Neolamprologus brichardi, and a more distantly related African cichlid, the Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. Based
on their wide use in behavioural, evolutionary, developmental, and genetic studies, we also selected four more
distantly related species that are not part of the order perciform [25]. Two poeciliid fish: platyfish (Xiphophorus sp.
[44]) and guppy (Poecilia reticulata [45]; 65 MY divergence
time [46]); one salmonid: Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar
[47]), and one cyprinid: zebrafish (Danio rerio [48]; 200
MY divergence time [46]). We first quantified the extent of
hybridization for a given species with a simple threshold
cut-off, and then compared these heterologous expression
profile results to the reference set of the 804 brainenriched genes from A. burtoni in order to quantify the
performance of heterologous hybridization for detection
of hybridization, regulation, and biologically meaningful
results.

Detection of hybridization
Without regard for the identity of the array features,
hybridization dynamics inform on the utility of the array.
The number of spots hybridizing above threshold intensity (2 SD above background) was determined for each
species (Figure 2, circles). While heterologous hybridization performed well for the two Tanganyikan cichlids and
the closely related tilapia, a marginally significant
decrease in the number of hybridized spots was seen for
the more distantly related species (Kruskal-Wallis test: χ2
= 13.35; p = 0.06). We hypothesize that this is due to the
fact that sequence divergence increases with phylogenetic
distance. While detecting hybridization demonstrates the
extent to which diverged sequences still give reliable
hybridization signals across the entire array, more sophisticated analysis is required to quantify the power to detect
expression differences in other species. For this reason, we
quantified the detection of expression ratios by heterologous hybridization for tissue specific gene expression.

cate how well the A. burtoni fold-changes account for the
fold-change variation in the other species. The slope of the
regression indicates the relative magnitude of gene regulation detected for the different species compared to A. burtoni. All regressions were highly significant (p < 0.0001).
For the three cichlid species, the regression coefficients
ranged between r2 = 0.58 and r2 = 0.80, demonstrating
that most expression differences between brain and
mixed-muscle tissues (58% to 80%) could be explained
by corresponding expression differences observed in A.
burtoni (data not shown). Likewise, slopes of the regression between these fold-changes were similar within cichlids (Figure 3) indicating that absolute fold-change values
were very similar in magnitude between A. burtoni and the
other members of this family.
In poeciliids, regression coefficients were r2 = 0.45 (Xiphophorus sp.) and r2 = 0.37 (P. reticulata). However, in the
more distantly related taxa (salmonids and cyprinids)
regression coefficients were r2 = 0.21 and r2 = 0.11, demonstrating that the A. burtoni data explained less of the
fold-change variation. This reflects the fact that more
spots showed different expression in these distantly

Table 1: Many genes are regulated in each species. Even in more distantly related fish species, the spots determined to be up-regulated
in the brain encompass a great number of unique spots, and are not simply a few genes represented multiple times on the array (n refers
to the number of array hybridizations). The estimated number unique genes up-regulated in brain is calculated independently for each
species based on the sum of singleton ESTs and the number of genes predicted by clustered ESTs relative to the sequence information
available. This result indicates that the redundancy rate for spots determined to be up-regulated in the brain is in agreement with the
overall array redundancy and that differences in expression can be detected for mRNAs of low copy number.

related species compared to A. burtoni. The drop in the
regression slope with phylogenetic distance (Figure 3)
suggests that although gene expression in A. burtoni and
the other species were in the same direction, the magnitude of change in expression that was detected was much
lower in these species. The effect of phylogenetic distance
on both our ability to detect subtle gene regulation and its
magnitude shows that the sensitivity of our array is very
good for cichlids and even species that are not members
of the perciformes (e.g., platyfish and guppy), but is lower
for distantly related species such as salmon and zebra fish.
Detection of regulated gene expression
For the Tanganyikan cichlid species, the number of spots
that showed significant up-regulation in the brain (E. melanogenys: 824; N. brichardi: 795; p < 0.05) was similar to
the number of spots observed for each A. burtoni (Figure
2, bars). However, the number of significantly regulated
spots decreased with phylogenetic distance in more distantly related species (O. niloticus: 472; Xiphophorus sp.:
585; P. reticulata: 713; S. salar: 433; D. rerio: 658). Based
upon the preliminary EST sequence data, we estimate that
~78% of these spots represent unique genes (Table 1).
These encouraging results demonstrate the power to
detect significant gene regulation using heterologous
hybridization. However, in order to validate the comparative approach with this technique it is crucial to demonstrate the ability to quantify the degree to which a given
spot is similarly regulated in the different species.

Detection of consistent gene regulation
Assuming that the reference set of 804 brain-enriched
spots identified in A. burtoni represents genes that are
always active in the brain independent of age, sex, and
reproductive status, we would expect a large fraction of
these spots to be similarly up-regulated in the brains of
other fish species. Figure 4A shows the percentage of spots
from the reference set that are also found to be up-regulated in the brains of each species. Within the cichlid species, 42% of the A. burtoni reference spots were also
identified in all three of the other cichlid species (340
spots) (Figure 4B). An additional 26% (206 spots) were
identified in the two more closely related Tanganyikan
cichlids, E. melanogenys and N. brichardi, bringing the total
to 68%. Within the non-cichlid species, 62% of the 804 A.
burtoni reference spots were also identified in at least one
species. The intersection of up-regulated brain spots for
members of the poeciliid family (Xiphophorus sp. and P.
reticulata) contained 42% (340 spots) of the reference set
(Figure 4C). In the very distantly related species, we identify 27% (217 spots) and 29% (236 spots) for S. salar and
D. rerio, respectively.

We investigated whether we could identify concordant
regulation through heterologous hybridization experiments in the other species using the 27 genes selected
above (> 75% concordant regulation across clones in A.
burtoni). For the Tanganyikan cichlids, N. brichardi and E.
melanogenys, 24 and 26 of these genes, respectively, passed
the same stringent cut-off. O. niloticus showed 19 genes
exceeding this threshold. As is expected from the data for

Spots of low fold change are under represented in heterologous hybridization.The 804 reference set spots are
divided into 6 classes according to fold change (> 6.0 n = 41; 5.0 – 6.0 n = 24; 4.0 – 5.0 n = 85; 3.0 – 4.0 n = 128; 2.0 – 3.0 n =
305 and 1.0 – 2.0 n = 221). For each fold change class (x-axis) the percentage of spots in that class (y-axis) that are also identified (p < 0.05) in other species are depicted by colour coded symbols. The under representation of low fold change classes is
most dramatic for more distantly related fish (note salmon, green and zebrafish, yellow).

genes that are re-identified in the more distantly related
species decreases with phylogenetic distance (Xiphophorus:
12; P. reticulata: 11; D. rerio: 8; S. salar: 8). Notably, the

clones are not eliminated from the list at random but
rather EST clusters tend to be either detected as brain upregulated or not in a concordant fashion (Figure 5).

Detection of subtle gene regulation
To determine if the capacity to detect subtle gene regulation with this array declines in other cichlid species, the
804 reference spots were binned into six classes according
to their average fold-change, as determined by a
combined analysis of all eight A. burtoni replicates. The
percentage of spots in each fold-change class that was also
significantly up-regulated in the brain tissue in the other
species is shown in Figure 6. Note that a spot is called "regulated" only if significant (p < 0.05) regardless of the magnitude of the fold-change in the heterologous
hybridization. Spots that showed > 3.0-fold change in A.
burtoni also showed significant brain-specific regulation in
the Tanganyikan cichlid species. Similarly, a large portion
(42% to 81%) of small fold-change spots (1-fold to 3fold) were also detected as significantly over-expressed in
the brains of E. melanogenys and N. brichardi. For heterologous hybridization with the more distantly related cichlid O. niloticus (ca. 10 million years divergence time), all
fold-change classes were underrepresented, but similar to
the closely related Tanganyikan cichlids, the detection of
significant regulation was more drastically compromised
for low fold-change classes. For heterologous hybridization in the poeciliid family (~65 million years divergence
time), represented by Xiphophorus sp. and P. reticulata,
spots regulated > 3.0-fold in A. burtoni were fairly well represented (59% – 83%), while spots in the lower foldchange classes were relatively underrepresented. In more
distantly related fish families, represented by S. salar and
D. rerio (>200 million years divergence time), brain-specific expression profiles were more uniformly and drastically compromised across all fold-change classes (18% –
45%). These data demonstrate that phylogenetic distance
most dramatically affects detection of subtly regulated
genes.

juvenile individuals of A. burtoni. The slight decrease in
our ability to identify the A. burtoni genes of subtle regulation (i.e., low fold-change classes) in other cichlid species
may be due to either the smaller number of replicates performed for these species or the increased individual variation in these fold-change classes. Alternatively, this result
could also reflect real species-specific differences in gene
expression. Even in distantly related species 26% – 53% of
the significantly up-regulated A. burtoni genes could still
be re-identified. In this analysis we assume that the
increasing number of genes that failed to hybridize with
increased phylogenetic distance was due mainly to
sequence divergence. This assumption provides a conservative guideline regarding the utility of heterologous
hybridization. Tissue-specific gene regulation is obviously
not expected to be identical in all species. Therefore, it is
possible that more than 26% – 53% of the array spots are
informative for distantly related species. Heterologous
hybridization experiments on any microarray are of limited use for genes that have undergone rapid evolutionary
change in coding regions, large rearrangements, and
duplication (e.g., functional divergence of paralogous
genes). Our regression analysis across species demonstrates that gene regulation is robust and identifiable,
although its magnitude decreases with phylogenetic distance. Our results suggest that with sound statistical analysis and additional replicates ([49-51]) even subtly
regulated genes can be identified in the distantly related
species. Given our results using species that have diverged
more than 65 million years ago (guppies and platyfish), it
is clear that this array will perform splendidly in the >
12,000 species within the large order Perciformes, to
which cichlids belong (e.g., gouramis, mackerels,
blennies, wrasses, bass, sunfish, perch, gobies, and
damselfish).

Discussion

Future detailed studies focusing on multiple species will
benefit from inter-species genomic DNA hybridizations in
order to determine spots that are most affected by
sequence divergence [2]. Such experiments will differentiate between genes whose regulation is different (genomichybridization ratios equal to 1) and genes whose
sequence has diverged considerably (genomic-hybridization ratios significantly different from 1). We explored
this strategy by competitively hybridizing to the array A.
burtoni genomic DNA against genomic DNA from either
the Nile tilapia (ca. 10 million years divergence time) or
the zebrafish (more than 200 million years of divergence).
As we had previously determined which of the 804
reference spots were significantly regulated in either of
these two species (see Figure 4), we divided the genomic
hybridization results for the reference spots into two
classes depending on whether they were also brainenriched in the other species or not. Interestingly, the
mean ratios of these two classes were not different in the

In this paper we describe the first systematic analysis of
heterologous microarray hybridizations across a range of
vertebrate species. This work validates the use of expression profiling for functional genomics within a comparative framework and provides a foundation for the
molecular and cellular analysis of complex traits at the
organismal, population, and ecological levels [24]. We
clearly show the utility of the array for heterologous
hybridization across a range of fish species for which there
is no other microarray available. We can detect array features (though reduced in number) that hybridize above
background as well as spots that show tissue-specific regulation, many of which correspond to those regulated in
A. burtoni.
The variation in brain-specific gene expression between
individual fish of different Tanganyikan cichlid species is
comparable to the variation observed between adult and

O. niloticus/A. burtoni genomic DNA hybridization (Student t-test: t = -1.6, p = 0.1). However, when genomic
DNA from A. burtoni and the distantly related D. rerio was
competitively hybridized to the array, we not only found
many spots that hybridized preferentially with A. burtoni
genomic DNA; we also found a significant difference for
the mean hybridization ratios (t = -9.4, p < 0.001)
between the two reference spot classes (i.e., those spots
that did and those that did not show significant brain-specific regulation in D. rerio). These results suggest that the
difference in gene regulation observed between A. burtoni
and the Nile tilapia may be due to real functional differences while the small number of re-identified reference
spots observed in zebrafish may be largely due to
sequence divergence. Sequence divergence hinders accurate hybridization at these spots during heterologous
hybridization experiments, indicating that these spots
cannot be used for functional analysis within this species.
In conclusion, genomic DNA hybridization experiments
can be used to estimate the false negative rate for a withinspecies RNA experiment and may be essential for distinguishing between variation due to sequence divergence
and variation due to transcript abundance in across-species RNA experiments. Two general rules can be derived
from this analysis: First, identify the phylogenetically closest existing array platform; second, before initiating an
extensive expression profiling experiment utilizing heterologous hybridization to any array, conduct a statistical
analysis of genomic hybridization results. These steps will
maximize the number of useful spots and assure the disqualification of those spots whose DNA hybridization
ratios are significantly different from 1.

morphology, male colour patterns, brain anatomy, reproduction, and behaviour, as well as the mechanisms
underlying phenotypic plasticity, which may contribute
to the rapid rate of speciation (reviewed in [55]).

The great number of ecological, evolutionary, aquaculture
and conservation studies in widely divergent fish species
will be greatly enhanced by the development of genomic
resources. Because natural variation is fundamentally
polygenic and arises from complex interactions within the
genome as well as with the environment, a multiple-gene
approach to the study of phenotypic regulation will provide new insights. The combination of diverse ecological
characteristics in African cichlid fishes and their ability to
reproduce a full behavioural repertoire in captivity provides a powerful framework for studies both in the field
and in the laboratory. Their astonishing phenotypic diversity, despite minimal genetic divergence, the result of a
uniquely rapid and recent radiation (e.g. [52-54]), allows
us to utilize a single cichlid microarray to study the more
than 2000 different East African cichlid species. We foresee the utility of this array for examining natural variation
of gene expression as it relates to phenotypic plasticity,
adaptation, and speciation, and population studies central to organismal and evolutionary biology. Both within
and across species this microarray can be used to study the
molecular basis of species-specific characters such as jaw

Methods

While the cichlid fish cDNA microarray will greatly facilitate the comparative functional genomic approach for an
important group of fishes, we expect that the results of our
systematic heterologous hybridization studies presented
here will encourage researchers in many fields to utilize
existing cDNA arrays for diverse groups of teleosts and
other taxa.

Conclusions
We have constructed a cDNA microarray with ~4500 features from a brain-specific cDNA library for the African
cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni. We describe the first
quantitative functional analysis of heterologous hybridization across a range of vertebrate species to a single
cDNA microarray platform. We validate a genomic strategy that overcomes some of the restrictions imposed by
systems for which only limited sequence information is
available. Although most robust when sample RNA is
derived from closely related cichlids, expression profiling
results showed consistent hybridization for other closely
related taxa (~65 million years divergence) and, to a lesser
extent, even very distantly related species. This work represents a first step toward bringing genomics to bear in
cichlids and other non-traditional model systems.
Crucially, we demonstrate the feasibility of functional
genomic studies in a comparative context for any
organism.

Part I: Construction of a custom-made cDNA array
Library construction – A full-length, directional (EcoRI –
XhoI) cDNA library was constructed in Lambda ZapII
phage vector (Stratagene) with mRNA from A. burtoni
brains (both sexes at all stages of development and social
condition were included) and was generously provided by
U. DeMarco and R. Fernald (Stanford University). The
pBluescript phagemid, pBSIIsk, was excised from the
Lambda ZAP vector, following protocol for transformation into XL1-Blue MRF' (Stratagene) E. coli strain for plating and picking.

Plating, selection, and amplification of bacterial colonies
– Cells were plated on LB agar supplemented with ampicillin in 20 cm Q-bot trays (Genetix). 5755 Bacterial colonies were selected by the Q-bot (Genetix) and inoculated
into 96-well plates with 150 µl LB+amp glycerol for overnight growth at 37°C in a humid incubator.
Replicated plates (without glycerol), produced a working
set of 58 plates for PCR amplification. Plasmid inserts

were amplified by colony PCR in Microseal 96-well plates
(MJ Research) on MJ Tetrads (MJ Research) using custom
vector primers for pBSIIsk- (CSVP2: TTCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAA, 23mer, Tm = 60.9°C; CSVP3:

=
62.7°C). Reaction conditions were as follows: 1 × Taq
Buffer + 2 mM MgCl2; 0.25 mM dNTP mix; 0,18 µM each
primer; 1.5 units FastStart Taq (Roche). Samples were
denatured for 5 min at 95°C followed by the 35 cycles of
95°C for 45 sec, 60°C for 20 sec, 72°C for 3 min. Samples
were then held at 72°C for 5 min and stored at 4°C. PCR
products were visualized on 1% agarose gels and scored
for strong, single product (4570 passes = 79.4%). The
plates were purified by vacuum filtration to remove excess
dNTPs and primers using the MultiScreen-PCR 96-well
Filtration System (Millipore); re-suspended in MilliQgrade water to an average estimated concentration of 100–
200 ng/µl; transferred to Costar 96-well V bottom polypropylene storage plates (Corning); and dehydrated for
storage. After all inserts had been amplified, the products
were re-suspended in nuclease-free de-ionized water and
compressed into a 384-well plate format without reconfiguration using a BioMek FX liquid handling robot (Beckman Instruments) and sterile barrier tips (BeckmanCoulter). The plates were dehydrated for storage and rehydrated in 10 µl of 3 × SSC for array printing.
Array production – All A. burtoni cDNA clones (including
1185 that failed the gel analysis above) and 120 control
clones were spotted in duplicate arrays onto NaOH
cleaned, poly-lysine (Sigma) coated slides using the 16pin format on an OmniGrid-100 arrayer (GeneMachines). Yeast, Arabidopsis, mouse, and human clones
were included as negative controls.
Slides were re-hydrated and UV cross-linked with 6000 mJ
(Stratalinker). Slides were blocked with succinate anhydride, 1-Methyl-2 polypyrolidinone and sodium borate,
then denatured in boiling water and spun dry according to
standard protocol [56]. Hydrated and blocked arrays were
stored in light-proof containers in a desiccator until
hybridization.
Part II: Characterization of cDNA array protocol and
cross-species hybridizations
Fish species used – Male A. burtoni, Enantiopus melanogenys
and Neolamprologus brichardi were randomly selected from
a lab-reared stock. The Tilapia (O. niloticus) was obtained
from aquaculture supplier. The other non-cichlid species
were obtained from a local supplier (Xiphophorus sp., Poecilia reticulata) from the Harvard University zebrafish facility (Danio rerio) and the S.O. Conte Anadromous Fish
Research Center (Atlantic salmon, S. salar).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/42

Fish were killed with 0.03% tricaine methanesulfonate
(Sigma) in accordance with the animal protocol (#22-22)
approved by the Harvard University Institutional Animal
Care & Use Committee, and brains and a mixture of "body
tissues" containing muscle, skin, and bone, were dissected
out immediately. The samples were minced in 1 ml of
RNAlater solution (Ambion) and stored in 4° overnight
followed by long term storage at -20°C.
DNA extraction- Genomic DNA was isolated from mixed
tissue. Approximately 100 mg of tissue was homogenized
and digested in buffer solution (60 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100
mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS) containing proteinase K (0.5 mg/
ml) at 37°C for 12 to 16 hours followed by phenol:chloroform:iso-amyl alcohol extraction (25:24:1) using the
Phase Lock Gel light system (Eppendorf) for phase separation. Yield and quality was evaluated by gel analysis and
standard spectrophotometric measurements.
DNA labelling- For each DNA probe 2 µg of genomic DNA
was restriction-digested with Sau3aI (New England
Biolabs) and labelled according to a standard Klenow protocol (Invitrogen) with direct incorporation of Cy3 or
Cy5-dCTP (Amersham). Labelled DNA was purified and
concentrated on a YM30 Amicon (Millipore) filter, salts
were adjusted to 3XSSC and 1.5 % SDS. The denatured
probe was applied beneath a lifter cover slip (Erie Scientific Corp.) and hybridized overnight in the dark at 65°C
in a humidified chamber (Telechem) submerged in a
water bath. Excess probe was removed by rinsing in 2 ×
SSC 0.01 % SDS at 65°C followed by two rinses at room
temperature (1 × SSC and 0.2 × SSC) and centrifuged to
dry.
RNA extraction – Total RNA was extracted from brains and
mixed tissue of males according to a standard Trizol protocol (Invitrogen), following tissue homogenization (Tissue Tearor, Biospec Products). The RNA was analyzed for
quantity and quality on the Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and a
standard spectrophotometer (Agilent).
RNA labelling – Two µg of total RNA was labelled for each
sample ([56] by first annealing primer in a 15 µl reaction
with 1 µl of primer solution (5 µg/µl each poly dT 12–18
or 5 µg/µl each poly dT 12–18 with 5 µg/µl random hexamer oligonucleotides). Reverse transcription reactions
were prepared on ice: 5 µl 5 × 1st strand buffer (Invitrogen); 2 µl 0.1 M DTT; 0.6 µl 50 × amino-allyl-dUTP/dNTP
mix (2.5 mM each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, 1.5 mM dTTP (Invitrogen) and 10 mM amino-allyl dUTP (Sigma)); and 2 µl
(200 U/µl) SuperScript II (Invitrogen), and then incubated at 42°C for 2 hours. RNA was hydrolyzed, and the
reaction was stopped by adding 10 µl of 1 N NAOH and
10 µl of 0.5 M EDTA and placed at 65°C for 7 min. The
reaction was neutralized with 25 µl of 1 M HEPES pH 7.5

(GIBCO BRL). The cDNA was then rinsed and concentrated on a YM-30 filter (Millipore). The dye-coupling
reaction required adding 1.5 µl of 1 M sodium bicarbonate pH 9.0 and the appropriate Cy3 or Cy5 CyDye Postlabeling reactive Dye Pack (Amersham) and placing it for
1 hour at room temperature in the dark. The labelled
cDNA was then purified using a Qiagen PCR column,
pooled with the appropriate sample for competitive
hybridization and concentrated to 50 µl on a YM 30 filter.
The appropriate hybridization buffer conditions were
achieved by adding 6 µl 20 × SSC (Gibco), 3 µl poly (dA)
poly(dT) (Sigma) and 0.96 µl 1 M HEPES and 0.9 µl 10%
SDS to each combined labelled probe. Hybridizations and
post-hybridization processing were performed as in the
DNA hybridization procedure (see above). Note that Cy3
and Cy5 dyes were "swapped" between tissues when technical replicates were performed, such that brain RNA was
labelled at least once in "green" (Cy3) and once in "red"
(Cy5) in a given species to avoid gene-by-dye effects [1].
Analysis – Hybridized arrays were scanned with an Axon
4000B scanner (Axon Instruments) using Genepix 4.0
software (Axon Instruments) for initial spot finding. The
data sets were filtered for spots flagged as "bad" because of
irregularities on surface of array (dust, speckle, scratch).
Intensity values of spots showing hybridization intensity
two standard deviations above background intensity in
both channels were used for spot counting and correlation analysis on technical replicates of A. burtoni genomic
DNA.

these two variables.
