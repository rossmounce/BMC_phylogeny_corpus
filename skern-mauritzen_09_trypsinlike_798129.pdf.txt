Abstract
Background: Trypsin-like serine proteases are involved in a large number of processes including
digestive degradation, regulation of developmental processes, yolk degradation and yolk
degradome activation. Trypsin like peptidases considered to be involved in digestion have been
characterized in Lepeophtheirus salmonis. During these studies a trypsin-like peptidase which differed
in a number of traits were identified.
Results: An intronless trypsin-like serine peptidase (LsTryp10) from L., salmonis was identified and
characterized. LsTryp10 mRNA is evenly distributed in the ovaries and oocytes, but is located along
the ova periphery. LsTryp10 protein is deposited in the oocytes and all embryonic cells. LsTryp10
mRNA translation and concurrent degradation after fertilization was found in the embryos
demonstrating that LsTryp10 protein is produced both by the embryo and maternally. The results
furthermore indicate that LsTryp10 protein of maternal origin has a distribution pattern different
to that of embryonic origin.
Conclusion: Based on present data and previous studies of peptidases in oocytes and embryos,
we hypothesize that maternally deposited LsTryp10 protein is involved in regulation of the yolk
degradome. The function of LsTryp10 produced by the embryonic cells remains unknown. To our
knowledge a similar expression pattern has not previously been reported for any protease.

Background
Trypsin-like serine peptidases of the S1A subfamily (hereafter referred to as S1A peptidases) are found in all metazoan groups and are involved in a variety of biological
processes [1,2]. They are synthesized as inactive zymogens
which are activated by proteolytic cleavage at a defined
site N-terminal to the proteolytic domain. They may consist of the proteolytic domain only (referred to as single

domain peptidases) or may contain one or more additional domains, generally N-terminal to the proteolytic
domain (referred to as multi domain peptidases). S1A
peptidases are generally extracellular peptidases although
some have intracellular functions [2,3]. S1A peptidases
involved in digestion commonly consist of a proteolytic
domain only, but single domain S1A peptidases may
exhibit strict specificity and serve regulatory roles [4-6].

However, regulatory S1A peptidases generally include one
or more additional domains [2,5,7]. Trypsins are S1A
peptidases with a specific architecture that cleave substrates after Arg and Lys [2]. They are common digestive
enzymes in metazoans and their zymogens are activated
by trypsins or enteropeptidases [2]. Once activated, the
digestive trypsins contribute to the proteolysis of ingested
proteins and also activate other digestive zymogens such
as chymotrypsinogens and proelastases [2].
S1A peptidases also play important roles during fertilization and early development; at fertilization S1A peptidases are necessary to prevent polyspermy by catalyzing
formation of a fertilization envelope [8,9] and in the early
embryo, S1A peptidases participate in developmental
control [10,11] and cell migration [12,13]. Egg yolk degradation has been reported to be catalyzed both by aspartic and cysteine cathepsins and serine peptidases,
including S1A peptidases [14-20]. S1A peptidases
involved in egg yolk degradationare suggested mainly to
serve in degradome activation [14,17,21], but it should be
noted that the main mechanism controlling activation of
yolk degrading proteases appears to be decreasing yolk
granule pH [14,15,22].
Proteins needed before the midblastula transition are supplied maternally or encoded by maternal mRNA. S1A
peptidases exerting their role in the embryos prior to the
midblastula transition appear to be transcribed and translated either maternally [23] or by germ line cells other
than the oocyte [10]. Proteases involved in, or putatively
involved in, yolk degradation generally appear to be translated before fertilization [24-26] although embryonic
transcription and translation of a vitellogenin degrading
S1A peptidase has been reported in Bombyx mori [18].
However, the exact spatiotemporal patterns of transcription and translation are unknown for many peptidases
active during early development. Maternal transcripts
have been reported to comprise transcripts from more
than 50% of the protein encoding genes in an organism
[27,28]. However, detailed studies of maternally encoded
S1A peptidases have not been reported previously.
Salmon lice (L. salmonis) are obligate ectoparasites on salmonid fishes and a major pest in salmon aquaculture.
Adult female salmon lice are fertilized by males that
deposit spematophores at the genital segment [29]. At regular temperature dependent intervals (approximately 10
days at 10°C (personal observations)) they produce a pair
of eggstrings (containing ≤ 1500 eggs) that are fertilized
when they are extruded [29]. During characterization of
trypsins and trypsin-like peptidases in L. salmonis [30-33]
we identified an intronless single domain trypsin that was
transcribed by adult female L. salmonis (LsTryp10, accession# EF490878). In the present study LsTryp10 is characterized and functional implications are discussed.

Results
Sequence analysis
EST sequencing led to identification of a 1052 b.p. transcript encoding a serine proteinase named LsTryp10. The
transcript consist of a 810 b.p. ORF, a 37 b.p. 5' untranslated region (UTR) and a 205 b.p. 3' UTR. Alignment of
genomic and corresponding cDNA sequences revealed
that LsTryp10 is devoid of introns. The protein was predicted to be secreted from the cell using the analytical
strategy recommended by Emanuelsson et al. [34]. The
encoded 270 amino acid (a.a.) protein with a predicted
weight of 30 kDa consist of a putative 17 a.a. signal peptide, a 10 a.a. activation peptide and a 243 a.a. proteolytic
domain. The proteolytic domain in the predicted protein
includes the catalytic triad His57, Asp102 and Ser195 in a
sequence context typical for proteinases of the S1A subfamily in addition to residues characteristic for S1A peptidases with trypsin specificity, including Tyr172, Asp189,
Gln192, Gly216 and Gly226 (chymotrypsinogen numbering [35]). The encoded trypsinogen appear to contain
the 3 cysteine bridges conserved in S1A peptidases [36]
and an additional cysteine bridge between Cys106 and
Cys129. However, LsTryp10 do not contain the disulphide bridge (Cys59 to Cys104) conserved in previously
described single domain trypsins from L. salmonis [31].
The overall identity to previously published trypsins from
L. salmonis [30,31,37] was ≤ 33%.
Phylogenetic analysis
The phylogenetic analysis shows that vertebrate, crustacean and insect trypsins reside on separate well-supported
branches (Fig. 1). Furthermore the vertebrate acrosins,
found in sperm cells, form a distinct group within a wellsupported monophyletic clade that includes Cortex Granule Serine Protease 1 (CGSP1) found in sea urchin eggs.
Most of the internal nodes in the phylogenetic tree were
not supported (Fig. 1) due to the high frequencies of
highly conserved and highly divergent residues resulting
in relatively low prevalence of informative semi-conserved residues. LsTryp10 does not appear to be closer
related to previously characterized L. salmonis single
domain trypsins [31] than to any of the other supported
trypsin branches. It should be noted that although
LsTryp10 resides on the same branch as the clip domain
containing serine peptidase LsCSP1 [33] this position is
not supported (Fig. 1).
Stage specific LsTryp10 transcription and size
confirmation
A single transcript of approximately 1200 b.p. was identified in the northern hybridization analysis (Fig. 2). This
corresponds well with the 1073 b.p. cDNA sequence. In
northern blot analyses LsTryp10 mRNA was undetectable
in adult males but present in mature females and unfertilized eggstrings (Fig. 2). This pattern was confirmed by QPCR analyses where LsTryp10 mRNA was present at backPage 2 of 11

ground levels in preadult stages and adult males, but was
significantly upregulated in adult females (Fig. 3). Microarray analysis have furthermore shown that LsTryp10 transcript abundance increase during development after the
last molt in females (Contig 328 in Eichner et al. [38]).
Localization of LsTryp10 mRNA
In situ hybridization showed that LsTryp10 mRNA was
present in the ovary and in the oocytes throughout the
oviduct (Fig. 4F–J). LsTryp10 mRNA is homogenously dispersed in the oocytes localized in the anterior part of the
oviducts in cephalothorax. Upon entry into the genital
segment the oocytes expand substantially in size, apparently due to incorporation of granules and lipids, and
LsTryp10 mRNA becomes localized to the periphery of the
ova (Fig. 4F).
Yolk lumen acidification, LsTryp10 protein localization,
translation and mRNA degradation
LsTryp10 protein was found in embryos and unfertilized
mature eggs. In the unfertilized oocytes inside the genital
segment LsTryp10 was distributed along the oocyte
periphery and in patches associated with yolk granules

showed that the LsTryp10 protein level in the fertilized
eggs increased between 1 hour and 48 hours after fertilization and then remained stable, whereas the encoding
LsTryp10 mRNA level decreased steadily from 1 to 192
hours after fertilization (Fig. 6). In contrast the LsTryp10
mRNA level in unfertilized eggs appeared relatively stable
between 1 and 108 hours after extrusion and then
decreased to a level comparable to that found in fertilized
eggs 192 hours after fertilization (Fig. 6). The yolk compartment was shown to be acidic at day 5 after fertilization
by exposing embryos to LysoTracker, whereas no indica-

tions of acidic compartments were identified elsewhere in
the embryo (results not shown).

Discussion
The results show that LsTryp10 encodes a peptidase that
includes the catalytic triad residues (His, Asp and Ser) in a
context typical for serine peptidases of the S1A clan in
addition to the specificity determinants for trypsin [4].
Transcript length and presence was confirmed by northern blot analysis (Fig. 2). Interestingly, LsTryp10 is devoid
of introns, which is a feature also reported for functional
digestive trypsins in Anopheles gambiae [39]. The phylogenetic analysis do not indicate a reliable phylogenetic position for LsTryp10, which appears no closer related to other
single domain trypsins from L. salmonis [30,31,33,37]
than to bacterial trypsin or the clip domain containing
LsCSP1 [33]. CGSP1, which is thought to activate the fertilization envelope and prevent polyspermy in sea urchins
[8], appears to be closer related to acrosins than to the
other serine peptidases included in the analysis. Since this
may give the impression that S1A peptidases related to fertilization form a monophyletic assemblage it should be
noted that mouse TESP4 which is suggested to have a fertilization related function [40], resides on a well supported branch with pancreatic trypsin from cow and
chicken (Fig. 1).
Background LsTryp10 transcription is detected in all investigated L. salmonis stages except adult females where it is
upregulated more than 2000-fold relative to the level in
nauplius II larvae (Fig. 3). In situ hybridization results
show that LsTryp10 mRNA is transcribed in the ovary.
LsTryp10 transcripts are evenly distributed in the imma-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/44

ture oocytes in the anterior oviduct in cephalothorax (Fig.
4H, J), but are located along the periphery of the ova in
the genital segment (Fig. 4F). The change in distribution
of LsTryp10 mRNA indicates that the transcripts are
actively localized in the egg, as are the transcription factor
bicoid mRNA in Drosophila melanogaster and the transforming growth factor Vg1 mRNA in Xenopus laevis [41,42]. The
3' UTR in LsTryp10 mRNA is substantially longer (205
b.p.) than the 3'-UTRs (44–104 b.p.) in previously characterized L. salmonis S1A peptidases [30,31,33,37]. Considering that localization of many transcripts, including
bicoid mRNA and Vg1 mRNA, depends on elements in
their 3' UTRs [41-45] the relatively long LsTryp10 mRNA
3' UTR may contain elements involved in control of
mRNA localization and translation.
The distribution of LsTryp10 mRNA suggests that it is a
maternal transcript. This notion appears to be supported
by the simultaneous LsTryp10 mRNA translation and degradation after fertilization (Fig. 6). However, immunohistochemical studies demonstrate this perception to be
incorrect as LsTryp10 protein is found in oocytes inside
the female's genital segment as well as in most embryonic
cells (Fig. 5). The question then arises: Is the embryonic
LsTryp10 protein encoded by maternal mRNA? The first
cleavage in order Siphonostomatoida (which includes L.
salmonis) is holoblastic but strongly unequal with the
smaller cell giving rise to the embryonic cells and the
larger cell containing most of the yolk [46-48]. A similar
development in L. salmonis must be expected which
implies that only a small fraction of the deposited maternal mRNA is present in the embryonic cells. The stable
level of LsTryp10 mRNA in developing eggs (Fig. 6) may
thus be the product of a simultaneous degradation of
maternal LsTryp10 mRNA in the large yolk containing cell
and zygotic transcription of LsTryp10 mRNA in the developing embryonic cells [47-49]. The very low expected levels of maternal LsTryp10 encoding transcripts inside the
embryonic cells thus strongly indicates that LsTryp10 protein translated after fertilization is encoded by zygotically
transcribed LsTryp10 mRNA. It is plausible that the maternal and zygotic LsTryp10 mRNAs are encoded by paralog
genes.
In the oocytes, maternally deposited LsTryp10 protein
(mLsTryp10) was found along the periphery and in
patches associated with vitellogenin granules inside the
yolk compartment (Fig 5). This yolk associated localization resembles the reported distribution of an Artemia
trypsin-like peptidase with a putative degradome activating function [50] as well as other peptidases putatively
involved in yolk degradation or degradome activation
[17,51,52]. Earlier reports suggest, that serine peptidases
are not directly responsible for yolk degradation but activate a second set of peptidases (generally cathepsins) that

(F, H, J) and sense (G, I, K) RNA probes show that LsTryp10 mRNA is present in the ovary (ov), in immature oocytes (io) in
the oviduct (ovd) as well as in mature oocytes in the unfertilized eggstring (ufe). In the mature oocytes LsTryp10 mRNA is

perform the degradation of the yolk [14,17,21]. A similar
function for mLsTryp10 protein is likely. Yolk degradation
appear to be initiated by yolk granule acidification in
many invertebrate species [15,22,52,53]. This may also be
the case in L. salmonis as we observed acidic conditions in
the yolk compartment in 5 days old embryos. It is possible
that acidification leads to autoactivation of mLsTryp10
protein that in turn activates the general yolk degradome.
The LsTryp10 protein translated by the embryo
(eLsTryp10) is found in all embryonic cells, including
cells in the antennae (Fig. 5D) which indicate that
eLsTryp10 has a function not related to egg yolk degradation. Based on the ubiquitous distribution of eLsTryp10 it
is likely to be involved in general developmental processes such as modification of the cell-matrix e.g. associated with cell movement [12,13]

In conclusion, LsTryp10 is a trypsin which is both deposited in the oocytes and translated after fertilization. Maternally deposited and embryonic LsTryp10 seems to be
translated from different pools of mRNA; one maternally
transcribed and one transcribed after fertilization. The
deposited LsTryp10 is likely to be involved in egg yolk
degradation whereas embryonic LsTryp10 appears to
serve a different purpose, e.g. cell matrix modification.
LsTryp10 is the first arthropod peptidase reported to be
both maternally deposited and translated in developing
embryos.

Conclusion
An intronless trypsin-like serine peptidase, LsTryp10, was
characterized in L. salmonis. LsTryp10 mRNA was significantly upregulated in adult females relative to all other

protein was found in ova as well as in developing embryos
where it was also shown to be translated. Considering the
pattern of the first cell divisions in L. salmonis, the present
results indicate that LsTryp10 proteins in the embryos
stem from two distinct lines of synthesis. First maternally
transcribed and translated LsTryp10 protein is deposited
in the oocytes and second embryonically transcribed
LsTryp10 mRNA is translated in all embryonic cells. The

Methods
Handling and sampling of fishes and parasites
L. salmonis were cultured on Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar
(Linnaeus)) as described previously [31]. L. salmonis for
quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) analysis were sampled as nauplius I larvae (n≈10000), nauplius II larvae
(n≈10000), infectious copepodids (n≈5000), chalimus III
(n = 35), preadult I&II males mixed (n = 10), preadult I

were stored in RNA later (Ambion, Huntingdon, UK), for
24 hours at 4°C and then at minus 20°C. Adult females
used for isolation of genomic DNA were stored in 70%
ethanol. Eggstrings for transcript quantification were sampled from fertilized females and unfertilized females.
These were obtained by incubating preadult II females on
salmon (not previously infected) with and without adult
L. salmonis males. The copulative statuses for the groups
were confirmed by visual examination for spermatophores. The eggstrings were sampled at 1 hour (± 30 minutes), 24 hours (± 4 hours), 60 and 108 hours (both ± 8
hours) after fertilization and stored at -80°C. Eggstrings
for protein analysis were sampled after 1 hour (± 30 minutes) and 48, 72, and 96 hours (all ± 8 hours).
Sequencing of gDNA and full-length cDNA
Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) from L. salmonis were
obtained as described previously [31] and are described in
Eichner et al. [38]. The trypsin encoding EST clone with
the longest insert was selected and completely sequenced
on both strands using primer walking. Additional 5'
sequence was obtained as described previously [31].
Based on the obtained cDNA sequences, primer pairs for
genomic PCRs were constructed and the resulting PCR
products were cloned and more than 30 clones were com-

pletely sequenced on both strands using primer walking.
Additional genomic sequence was obtained using the
GenomeWalker kit in accordance with the manufacturers
instructions (Clonetech, Mountain view, California,
USA).
Northern blot hybridization analyses
Total RNA was purified from unfertilized eggstrings, an
adult male and an adult female L. salmonis using TRIZOL®
following the manufacturers recommendations (Life
Technologies, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA). Northern
blotting was performed using approximately 4.5 μg RNA
per well and sequence specific [32P] labeled DNA probes
against the LsTryp10 ORF and the homogeneously transcribed eEF1 [54]. Membranes were prehybridized 30–60
min. at 68°C in PerfectHyb solution (Sigma-Aldrich Norway, Oslo, Norway). Denatured probes were added and
incubation was continued over night. After washing twice
for 10 min. at 68°C in 0.1× SSC/0.1× SDS, signals from
the membrane were detected using Kodak BioMax MS XRay film (Kodak, Rochester, New York, USA).
Bioinformatic analysis
Sequence handling and editing was done using Vector NTI
9.1.0 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, and USA.) and

GeneDoc http://www.psc.edu/biomed/genedoc. For analysis of a plausible protein location the translated LsTryp10
sequence was analyzed by submission to TargetP 1.1 [55],
SignalP 3.0 [56], TMHMM 2.0 [57], TMBETA-NET [58]
and big-PI [59] according to the suggestion by Emanuelsson et al. [34]. Phylogenetic analyses of selected amino

were performed using the Phylip package [60] and TreePuzzle v. 5.2 [61]. Mutation rate heterogeneities were calculated in Tree-Puzzle using the JTT model and 8 rate heterogeneities. The distribution coefficient α was 0.93. A
maximum likelihood tree was generated by Proml in the
Phylip package (jumbling 10 times) and support was calculated by bootstrapping (100 replicates in Phylip) and
puzzling (10000 times in Tree-Puzzle).

dilution as previously described [31] with the exception
that cDNA was made using MultiScribe reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturers recommendations (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA).
Relative expression levels were expressed as ΔCT relative to
the mean transcript level in all the sampled eggstrings
using the following formula:

ΔC T = C T mean*dilution − C T sample*dilution
Where CT mean*dilution is the mean of the CT values of all
samples at a given dilution and CT sample*dilution is the mean
CT value of the sample parallels at a given dilution. The

Relative quantification of LsTryp10 mRNA levels
The transcript levels during the L. salmonis life cycle and in
eggstrings at different ages after fertilization were determined by Q-PCR using ABI 7900 HT (eggs and embryos)
and ABI 7700 (adults and larval stages) PCR Systems
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) at
standard settings. The real-time primers and probe were:
Forward primer: TTG CAA GAC CGG AAC AAG AAC.
Reverse primer: CAA ATC TGA GTA CAC CCC AAC CT.
Probe: 6FAM-CAA CTA CAA GAG GTG TCC CAT CCG
GG-TAMRA. The real time assays were performed as previously described [31] with the modification that additional
TurboDNase (Ambion, Huntingdon, UK) treatments were
performed on the RNA from nauplius I and II, chalimus
III and preadult males and females. The results were analyzed by the ΔCT approach [62] as described previously
[31]. The 95% c.i. values at each developmental stage presented in Fig. 3 were calculated from the average ΔΔCT values for each dilution, except for nauplius II (which was
used as calibrator thereby defining the average ΔΔCT values as 0 for this stage). For nauplius II the 95% c.i. shown
in Fig. 3 was calculated from the average ΔCT at each dilution. The results were confirmed by analysis using a
kinetic approach [63] as earlier suggested [64].

For determination of relative LsTryp10 mRNA levels in
eggs, total RNA from four pairs of eggstrings for each sampled time point was isolated in TRI REAGENT (SigmaAldrich Norway, Oslo, Norway) using a FastPrep homogenizer and Lysing Matrix D (Q-Biogene, Solon, Ohio,
USA). Extracted RNA was treated with TURBO DNAse
(Ambion, Huntingdon, UK) and added 0.5 U/μl SUPERase• In™ (Ambion, Huntingdon, UK). Excellent quality
and integrity of the RNA was confirmed using a Bioanalyzer according to the manufacturers instructions (Agilent,
Santa Clara, California, USA.). Concentrations were
adjusted to 100 ng/μl following quantification on a NanoDrop ND 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) and diluted in two

values from the five dilutions. The results were confirmed
by analysis using a kinetic approach [64].
Identification of LsTryp10 mRNA localization
The localization of LsTryp10 mRNA in adult female L. salmonis was determined by in situ hybridization as described
previously [31] using a cDNA clone covering 669 base
pairs (b.p.) of the open reading frame (ORF) as template
for RNA probe synthesis. Hybridizations were performed
with antisense probes to show localization of transcripts
and with sense probes as negative controls. Labeled
probes were visualized using anti-DIG alkaline phosphatase FAB fragment (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and a
chromogen substrate containing Levamisol (SigmaAldrich Norway, Oslo, Norway), NTB and BCIP (Roche,
Basel, Switzerland).
Histological analysis of L. salmonis
Adult female L. salmonis were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, dehydrated in ethanol (70%, 80%, 90% and
95%) and subsequently embedded in Technovit 7100 following the manufacturers recommendations (Heraeus,
Hanau, Germany). Sections (2 μm) were produced using
a microtome, stained with metachromatic toluidin and
examined using a Leica DMRBE light microscope (Leica
Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).
Relative quantification of LsTryp10 protein levels in
fertilized eggs
The relative amounts of LsTryp10 protein in developing
fertilized L. salmonis eggs were determined by enzyme
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using rabbit peptide
antiserum raised against the peptide CEMHPGYSTSKQDN conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (BioGenes, Mannheim, Germany). The eggs (4 eggstring pairs
from each sampled age) were cut in small pieces and

homogenized by sonication in 250 μl 50 mM Tris, 1 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 10 while on ice. Sonication was
performed with a microtip for a total of 60 seconds in
short pulses (≤ 20 seconds) followed by centrifugation at
3000 g, 4°C for 20 minutes. The water soluble protein
concentration was normalized to 600 μg/ml using the
Bio-Rad protein assay kit II as instructed by the manufacturer (BioRad, Hercules, California, USA.). ELISA was conducted according to Sommerset et al. [65] with the
following modifications: After each incubation step,
except after addition of conjugate, the ELISA plates were
washed 3 times with PBST. Nunc-Maxisorb microplates
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Roskilde, Denmark) were
coated ON at 4°C with four dilutions (50, 25, 12 and 6
μg/ml) of the normalized protein solution, blocked at RT
for one hour with 5% non fat dry milk powder in PBST,
and incubated for 2 hours at RT with antiserum diluted
1:100 in PBST containing 1% non fat dry milk powder
(Sigma-Aldrich Norway, Oslo, Norway). Bound antibodies were detected by addition of HRP conjugated goatanti-rabbit ABs (BioRad, Hercules, California, USA,
1:2000 in PBST, 1% non fat dry milk powder (Nestlé,
Sandvika, Norway), 1 hour at RT), followed by 6 washes
with PBST and incubation with 100 μl o-Phenylenediamine + H2O2 according to instructions from the manufacturer. The chromogenic reaction was stopped after 20
minutes by addition of 50 μl 2,5N H2SO4. Absorbances at
492 nm were measured for the above described antisera
(Abstest) and their corresponding preimmune sera (Absbacground) from the same plates. The corrected absorbance
(Abscorr) was calculated as:

Abs corr = Abs test − Abs bacground
Relative protein levels (RPL) were calculated relative to
the mean protein level in all the sampled eggstrings using
the following formula:

RPL = Abs corr*sample / Abs corr*dilution mean*dilution
Where Abscorr*sample is the Abscorr for a protein sample at a
given dilution and Abscorr*dilution mean*dilution is the mean
Abscorr for all samples at that dilution. The c.i. was calculated from four parallel RPL values for each of the four
dilutions. Pilot studies using the above design and the
described peptide antiserum as well as five additional
peptide antisera at various dilutions were conducted in
advance to enable selection of the best serum and appropriate dilutions.

hours in 3% albumin, PBS, 0.5% Triton-X. The embryos
were subsequently incubated with the antiserum used for
ELISA (as described above) diluted 1:100 for 20 hours and
washed in PBS-AT for 2 hours followed by incubation
with Alexa Flour 594 conjugated goat-anti rabbit antibody
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA.) diluted 1:200
over night. Samples were mounted using ProLong Gold
with DAPI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA.) Paraffin sections (3 μm) were processed according to standard
protocols. Slides were blocked with 3% albumin and
incubated for 16 hours with the above mentioned antiserum. Alexa Flour 594 conjugated goat-anti rabbit antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA.) diluted
1:200 was used as a secondary antibody. Samples were
mounted using ProLong Gold(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA.). Confocal imaging was performed with a
Leica TCS SP2 AOBS microscope (Leica Microsystems,
Wetzlar, Germany) at the Molecular Imaging Center
(FUGE, Norwegian Research Council, University of Bergen). Parallel negative controls were performed without
primary antibody. At similar confocal settings no signals
were detected from negative controls (except for signal
from DAPI where present).
Embryonic LysoTracker assays
Developing embryos were obtained as described in the
previous section. The dissected eggs were immediately
incubated in filtered sea water with 50 nM LysoTracker
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA.) for 30 minutes.
Embryos were then briefly washed in seawater and visualized as described above.
