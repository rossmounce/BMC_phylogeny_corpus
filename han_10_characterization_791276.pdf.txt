Characterization, phylogeny, alternative splicing and
expression of Sox30 gene
Fei Han†, Zhijian Wang†, Fengrui Wu, Zhihao Liu, Baofeng Huang, Deshou Wang*

Abstract
Background: Members of the Sox gene family isolated from both vertebrates and invertebrates have been proved
to participate in a wide variety of developmental processes, including sex determination and differentiation.
Among these members, Sox30 had been considered to exist only in mammals since its discovery, and its exact
function remains unclear.
Results: Sox30 cDNA was cloned from the Nile tilapia by RT-PCR and RACE. Screening of available genome and
EST databases and phylogenetic analysis showed that Sox30 also exists in non-mammalian vertebrates and
invertebrates, which was further supported by synteny analyses. Tissue expression in human, mouse and tilapia
suggested that Sox30 was probably a gonad-specific gene, which was also supported by the fact that Sox30 EST
sequences were obtained from gonads of the animal species. In addition, four alternatively spliced isoforms were
isolated from tilapia gonad. Their temporal and spatial expression patterns during normal and sex reversed gonadal
development were investigated by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Our data suggest that expressions of Sox30
isoforms are related to stage and phenotypic-sex, observed in the germ cells of male gonad and in somatic cells of
the female gonad.
Conclusions: Sox30 is not a gene only existed in mammals, but exists widely throughout the animal kingdom as
supported by our bioinformatic, phylogenetic and syntenic analyses. It is very likely that Sox30 is expressed
exclusively in gonads. Expression analyses revealed that Sox30 may be involved in female and male gonadal
development at different stages by alternative splicing.

Background
Since the discovery of Sry [1-3], numerous genes encoding proteins containing HMG (High Mobility Group)
domain have been identified throughout the animal
kingdom [4-6]. Genes with their HMG domains similar
to that of Sry (testis determining gene in mammals) by
at least 50% were named as Sox (SRY-related HMGbox) genes [5]. At present, Sox genes encoding transcription factors, count about 30 members in vertebrates
[6,7]. Based on differing levels of structural, organizational similarities and other features, Sox genes can be
subdivided into 10 groups, named from A to J [8].
Members of the same group are similar to each other
within and outside the HMG-box. However, members

from different groups share lower degree of identity in
the HMG-box, and no significant identity outside this
domain. Many of the Sox proteins, like Sry, Sox2, Sox3,
Sox11 and Sox22, are encoded by a single exon [9-12].
In contrast, others, such as Sox6, Sox9, Sox17 and
Sox30, consist of multiple exons [13-16]. In addition, the
Sox genes are scattered on different chromosomes and
are not clustered [5]. Apart from the Sry and Sox3
located on the Y- and X-chromosome respectively,
other Sox genes are autosomal [17].
Sox30 (SRY-box containing gene 30), the only member
of group H, has been characterized merely in a few species so far. It was firstly isolated from mouse (Mus musculus) and human (Homo sapiens). In these species, two
transcripts of Sox30 mRNA were found, one of which
encodes a truncated protein lacking partial C-terminal
region due to a frame shift [16]. Sox30 was considered
to be involved in mammalian spermatogonial differentiation and spermatogenesis [16,18]. As no sequences of

Sox30 were available from any other groups of animals,
including the sequenced fish genomes at that time,
some scholars even speculated that Sox30 was specific
to mammals [19]. In zebrafish (Danio rerio), a Sox30
gene has been reported [20], however, it was proved to
be Sox21 by GenBank blast and phylogenetic analysis.
Interestingly, in our present study, Sox30 was isolated
from the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) accidentally
when cloning Sox9b. Subsequently, by blast search and
data mining, Sox30 was also found to exist in genome
sequences of the chicken (Gallus gallus), green anole
lizard (Anolis carolinensis), western clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis), sea squirts (Ciona intestinalis), lancelets
(Branchiotoma belcheri), acorn worm (Saccoglossus
kowalevskii), sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis), and
ESTs (Expressed Sequence Tags) of the channel catfish
(Ictalurus punctatus), guppy (Poecilia reticulata), fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), little skate (Leucoraja erinacea), dogfish (Squalus acanthias), the
California mussel (Mytilus californianus) and snail (Lottia gigantean). Thus we report here that Sox30 exists
widely throughout the animal kingdom rather than specific to mammals as reported previously. More importantly, we isolated four alternatively spliced isoforms of
Sox30, and studied their temporal and spatial expression
patterns during normal and sex reversed gonadal development in tilapia. Our data suggest that Sox30 may play
key roles in gonadal development, and the roles may be
different at different stages and sexes.

Methods
Animals

The Nile tilapias for this study were reared in large
tanks with a circulating aerated freshwater system. Fish
were maintained at ambient temperature (26°C) under
natural photoperiod. All genetic females (XX) and males
(XY) were obtained by artificial fertilization of eggs from
normal females (XX) with sperms from either sex
reversed males (XX) or super males (YY), respectively
[21]. Then, artificially fertilized eggs were cultured in
recirculating water at 26°C to obtain fry. All animal
experiments conformed to the Guide for Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Committee of Laboratory Animal Experimentation at Southwest University, China.
Drug treatment

XX males and XY females were generated by treating fry
with estrogen receptor antagonist tamoxifen (TAM)
(Novartis Company, AG, Switzerland) and 17b-estradiol
(E2) (Sigma, USA), respectively. Fish feed were sprayed
with 95% ethanol containing TAM, 25 μg/g; E2, 50 μg/
g. Control fish were fed with 95% ethanol sprayed feed.
Drug treatment was applied to the fry from 5 to 30 days

after hatching (dah), the critical period of the Nile tilapia sex differentiation [22]. E2 (XY) and TAM (XX)
treatment resulted in complete sex reversal in tilapia,
respectively [23].
Cloning of tilapia Sox30 cDNA and genomic DNA

The SMART RACE cDNA of the gonads, which was
used to perform both 5’ and 3’-rapid implication of
cDNA ends (RACE) to obtain full-length cDNA of tilapia Sox30, were synthesized according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Clontech). The Sox30 5’ cDNA end
was amplified accidentally with primers for Sox9b (partial sequence 225 bp, accession number: DQ632575),
and confirmed by blastx http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/.
Subsequently, 3’ RACE primers were designed to
amplify 3’ cDNA end for tilapia Sox30. Finally, to verify
the full-length sequences of Sox30 cDNA, end-to-end
PCR was performed and four mRNA isoforms were
identified by using 5’- and 3’-UTR primers (T30UTR-F,
T30UTR-R). In order to determine the gene structure of
the tilapia Sox30, the genomic DNA sequence of this
gene was amplified. Genomic DNA was prepared from
mature testis and ovary. A 3790 bp Sox30 gene fragment
with complete cds (coding sequences) and four introns,
102, 1518, 106 and 980 bp in length, was obtained by
genomic PCR using end primers T30UTR-F and
T30UTR-R. All the primers and sequences used in the
present study were listed in Table 1. The PCR products
were resolved on a 1.2% agarose gel and the target DNA
fragments were purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction
Kit (Qiagen, Germany).
All the fragments obtained were cloned into pGEM-T
Vector (Promega, USA) and bi-directional sequencing
was performed by the dideoxy chain termination
method using an ABI PRISM 377 DNA genetic analyzer
(Sangon, Shanghai, China).
Data mining and sequence analyses

The following genome databases were searched to
explore the presence of Sox30-like sequences in other
vertebrate and invertebrate species, including the UCSC
Genome Bioinformatics at: http://genome.ucsc.edu/, the
NCBI databases at http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, the Silk
DB databases at http://silkworm.genomics.org.cn/, the
JGI databases at http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Nemve1/
Nemve1.home.html, the Ensembl databases http://www.
ensembl.org/biomart/martview/ and the Gene DB databases at http://www.genedb.org/genedb/smansoni/.
Sox30-like sequences were identified from seven species
by blast search against genome sequences and further
confirmed in EST databases, i.e., chicken (XP_414564,
CN227447, CN229457, CO771932 and BU460467),
anole lizard (scaffold_69: 1510867-1526492), frog (scaffold_ 177: 129323-130299, CX934092 and CX934091),

but failed to identify it from other 80 animal species with
genome sequence information. Partial or complete Sox30like sequences were also identified by blast search against
the NCBI EST databases from channel catfish (FD337967),
guppy (ES386169), fathead minnow (DT310961,
DT345945, DT310040, DT100872 and DT266812), little

California mussel (ES397482) and snail (FC701316,
FC674522, FC687599 and FC698472).
The orientation and chromosomal position of Sox30
and its adjacent genes Thg1l (tRNA-histidine guanylyltransferase 1-like) and Adam19 (ADAM metallopeptidase domain 19) were determined manually from the
gene orientations listed in BIOMART from the Ensembl
database. Synteny analyses of Sox30, Thg1l and Adam19
in human, mouse, chicken, anole lizard and frog were
performed by comparing the cDNA sequences with genome sequence using BLAST search from the UCSC
Genome Bioinformatics or by search in BIOMART from
the Ensembl database.
The multiple alignment software DNAstar and ClustalX were employed to analyze the nucleotide sequences
and their deduced amino acid (aa) sequences. Based on
the alignment results, a phylogenetic tree of Sox30 proteins was constructed using the fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster) SoxF as an outgroup. The Sox30 sequences
isolated from chicken, anole lizard, frog, channel catfish,
guppy, fathead minnow, little skate, dogfish, sea squirts,
lancelets, acorn worm, the California mussel, snail and
sea anemones were also included in the phylogenetic
analysis. The tree was constructed using the neighborjoining method. The scores represent bootstrap values
of 1000 trials, indicating the credibility of each branch.
All the aa sequences used in the phylogenetic analysis
were obtained from GenBank, UCSC and JGI Genome
Bioinformatics, except that from tilapia. The GenBank

accession numbers and scaffold numbers of these
sequences are listed in Table 2.
Analysis of Sox30 expression by RT-PCR and
semiquantitative RT-PCR

Total RNAs (2.0 μg) were isolated from various tissues of
adults (240dah) (XX and XY fish, for tissue distribution
analysis) and the gonads of monosex (XX and XY fish at
5, 10, 15, 35, 90, 150, 240dah, for ontogeny analysis).
Thereafter, total RNAs were treated with DNase I to eliminate the genomic DNA contamination. Then first strand
cDNAs were synthesized and RT-PCR was carried out to
check the expression levels of tilapia Sox30 according to
methods described previously [24]. The templates for positive and negative controls were set with Sox30 plasmid
DNA and deionized water, respectively. A 342-bp fragmentofb-actin was amplified as internal control to test the
quality of the cDNAs used in the PCR. The PCR products
were subjected to agarose gel (1.2%) electrophoresis.
To examine the influence of drug treatment on Sox30
gene expression, gonads of 5 individuals were collected
from each control group (XX female, XY male) and drug
treated group (TAM-induced XX male and E2-induced
XY female) when the fish were adult at 240dah. Semiquantitative RT-PCR [25] was performed to measure the
mRNA levels using the primers (T30UTR-F, T30UTR-R)
described in the previous section. A series of PCRs with
different cycle numbers (from 22 to 36, with an interval of
2) were performed to determine the linear phase of the
amplification using 1 to 5 diluted cDNA template. Based
on these pilot experiments, 28 cycles for b-actin and 34
cycles for the target gene were chosen and applied to the
subsequent semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses. Band
intensities resulting from the PCR amplification were analyzed using the image analysis software Quantity One
(Bio-Rad). Sox30 alternatively spliced mRNA levels were
expressed relative to that of b-actin in each sample. In our
study, b-actin expression was found to be unaffected by
the drug treatment [23]. Results obtained were expressed
as mean values ± S.E.M. from five individual fish. Data

analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA and the
least significant difference on the GraphPad Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
In situ hybridization (ISH)

Tilapia gonads from 10, 120 and 210dah were dissected and
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.85× PBS (pH 7.4)
at 4°C overnight. After fixation, gonads were embedded in
paraffin. Cross-sections of 5 μm were cut with a sliding
microtome. Probes of both sense and antisense digoxigenin
(DIG)-labeled RNA strands were transcribed in vitro from a
linearized tilapia Sox30 plasmid, using the RNA labeling kit
(Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). In situ
hybridization was carried out as follows: sections were
deparaffinized, hydrated and treated with proteinase K (10
μg/ml, Amersco, USA) and then hybridized with the sense
or antisense DIG-labeled RNA probe at 60°C for 16-22 h.
The hybridization signals were then detected using alkaline
phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (Roche, Germany) and NBT as the chromogen [26].

Results
Molecular cloning of tilapia Sox30

The Sox30 genomic DNA and four alternatively spliced
cDNAs were cloned from the Nile tilapia. The genomic

DNA is 3790 bp long (GenBank accession no.
GQ463457), containing 5 exons, 193, 135, 240, 253 and
241 bp, respectively, and four introns (two in the Nterminal region, one in the C-terminal region and one
within the HMG-box). All introns share the typical
intron characteristics (gt——ag). The isolated full-length
Sox30 cDNA (isoform-I) is 1474 bp (GenBank accession
no. GQ463453), containing an open reading frame
(ORF) of 1062 bp encoding a putative protein of 353 aa,
a 116 bp 5’ untranslated region (UTR), and a 296 bp 3’
UTR. The other three alternatively spliced isoforms (isoform-II, -III and -IV, GenBank accession nos.
GQ463454, GQ463455 and GQ463456) amplified by the
same pair of primers were 306, 240 and 597 bp shorter
than the ORF of isoform-I due to exon skipping. The
four isoforms share the same 5’-UTR, while only isoform-I and -III share the same 3’-UTR. Isoform-II and
-IV have 3’-UTRs 104 bp longer than those of isoform-I
and -III due to the reading frame shift and introduction
of a stop codon which is 104 bp upstream of the stop
codon found in isoform-I and -III transcripts. Further
analysis suggested that these isoforms (I-IV) contain 5,
5, 4 and 3 exons, respectively. Compared with the longest isoform (isoform-I, which contains 5 exons), part of
exon 4, exon 3, exon 3 and exon 4 was spliced off in

dah with a very interesting expression profile: ovary only
at 10 and 15 dah; both ovary and testis from 35 dah
onwards, higher in testis than in ovary from 90 dah to
adult (Figure 5B). Isoform-II showed a male-specific
expression from 90 dah to adult. Isoform-III was
detected exclusively in male gonad at 10 dah only, and
no expression was detected during any other developmental stages. Isoform-IV started to express in both testis and ovary from 90 dah onwards, with higher level in
the ovary from 150 dah to adult.

Sequence, phylogeney and synteny analyses

Multiple alignment of the aa sequences of Sox30 s from
various species revealed that Sox30 was poorly conserved except in the HMG-box, the characteristic DNA
binding domain (Figure 2). The HMG-boxes of tilapia
and guppy Sox30 shared the highest similarity (about
52.9%), whereas the whole peptides of both shared
rather low similarity (about 28%). Compared with Sox30
from mammals, tilapia Sox30 is shorter in both N- and Cterminal regions (Figure 2A). As was shown in Figure 3,
Sox30 s isolated from tilapia and other species were clustered into the same clade with the mammalian Sox30 s,
indicating that they are genuine Sox30 s. Synteny analyses
showed that Sox30 and its adjacent gene Thg1l and
Adam19 were located on the same chromosome/scaffold
in the same gene order in human, mouse, chicken, anole
lizard and frog (Figure 4).
Tissue expression of Sox30 gene

Tissue distribution analysis using RT-PCR revealed that
only three of the four isoforms of tilapia Sox30 (isoform-I, -II and -IV) were expressed in adult. They were
expressed exclusively in gonads, with isoform-I higher in
the testis; isoform-IV higher in the ovary; while isoformII only in the testis, not in the ovary (Figure 5A).
Ontogeny of Sox30 expression in tilapia gonads

Sox30 expression was detected in gonads of tilapia during sex determination, differentiation and later development by RT-PCR. Isoform-I mRNA was detected
consistently in the gonads at 10, 15, 35, 90, 150 and 240

Consistent with tissue distribution results, three isoforms (I, II and IV but not III) were detected in adult
gonads by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Isoform-I and -IV
mRNA were detected in gonads of all four groups, i.e.
XX (♀) and XY (♂) control fish and sex reversed XX
(♂, induced by TAM treatment) fish and sex reversed
XY (♀, induced by E2 treatment) fish. Isoform-I was significantly down-regulated in sex reversed XY (♀)
gonads, but up-regulated in sex reversed XX (♂) gonads,
being consistent with the result of tissue distribution
and ontogeny analyses that isoform-I was expressed
higher in the testis; Isoform-IV was up-regulated in sex
reversed XY (♀) gonads, but down-regulated in sex
reversed XX (♂) gonads, which was consistent with that
isoform-IV was expressed higher in the ovary. IsoformII mRNA was only detected in normal XY (♂) and sex
reversed XX (♂) gonads but not in normal XX (♀) and
sex reversed XY (♀) gonads, consistent with that isoform-II showed a male gonad-specific expression in tissue distribution and ontogeny analyses. These data
indicated that the expressions of Sox30 are phenotypically related rather than genotypically related (Figure 6).
Expression of Sox30 by in situ hybridization in tilapia
gonads

To ascertain which population of cells in the developing
gonads expresses Sox30, ISH was performed using gonads
at 5, 10, 120 and 210 dah. Specific signals were observed
in the male (XY) germ cells at 10 dah (Figure 7E) and the
sperms of the testis at 120 and 210 dah (Figure 7F, G). In
contrast, specific signals were detected in the female (XX)
somatic cells at 10 dah (Figure 7A), interstitial cells of the
ovary at 120 dah (Figure 7B), and theca and granulosa
cells of the ovary at 210 dah (Figure 7C), but no signal was
detected in both sexes at 5 dah (data not shown). Taking
the ontogeny results into consideration, we conclude that
isoform-III is restricted to the germ cells in male gonads
and isoform-I is expressed in the somatic cells of the
female gonads at 10 dah.
However, due to the overlapping probes (The probes
used in this study recognize all the four Sox30 isoforms.
It is impossible to design isoform-specific probe for all

of them), we failed to distinguish the signals detected at
120 and 210 dah gonads. At least three and two isoforms could produce the signals detected in the testis
and the ovary, respectively at these stages.

including only partial N- terminal and HMG-box regions.

Sox9b. It was characterized as Sox30 by subsequent blast
against GenBank for its relatively high identity with its
mammalian orthologs, which was further confirmed by
phylogenetic and syntenic analyses. To date, Sox30 has
been reported only in mammals [16,18,19], but not in
any non-mammalian vertebrates (including fish) and
invertebrates. Our data, for the first time, provided the
solid proofs for the existence of Sox30 in a teleost fish,
the Nile tilapia.

Figure 7 Expression of tilapia Sox30 in gonads examined by in
situ hybridization with antisense (A-C, E-G) and sense (D, H)
probes. At 10 dah, Sox30 expression appears in germ cells (gc) of
the male gonad (E), and in a few round somatic cells (sc) of the
female gonad (A); at 120 dah, Sox30 was expressed in sperms (sp)
of the testis (F) and interstitial cells (ic) of the ovary (B); at 210 dah,
Sox30 was expressed in sperms of the testis (G), theca (tc) and
granulosa cells (grc) of the ovary (C). The arrow and arrowhead
indicate signals of Sox30 in the XY and XX gonads, respectively.

(Gasterosteus aculeatus), takifugu (Takifugu rubripes)
and tetraodon (Tetraodon nigroviridis) were searched for
possible Sox30-like genes. However, it seems that this
gene does not exist in any database of these teleosts.
EST data bases were also searched afterward, and complete or partial Sox30 sequences were successfully isolated from the channel catfish, guppy, fathead minnow,
little skate and dogfish. Further screening of the genome
sequences of other animals showed that Sox30 was also
present in other chordates, including chicken, anole
lizard, frog, sea squirts, lancelets and acorn worm (also
called as SoxH in the last three species), and non-chordate invertebrates, including the California mussel, snail
and sea anemone (also called as SoxH), while not found
in the nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans), fruitfly and
sea lamprey. A recent report stated the existence of
Sox30-like sequence in sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus) [27], but we failed to find in the genome
and EST databases by blast search. These findings suggested that Sox30 is not specific to mammals, but also
exists in other vertebrates and invertebrates. Then, why
we failed to find Sox30-like sequences in all sequenced
teleost genomes? There are two possible explanations.
One is that the genome sequences from these species
have not covered all the genome yet; and the other is
that Sox30 was secondarily lost in these species during
evolution. However, the chance for the latter possibility
is quite small because of the following two reasons, 1)
cyprinids and ictalurids, such as fathead minnow and
channel catfish, are relatively primitive teleosts while
cichlids and poeciliids, such as tilapia and guppy, are
relatively advanced teleosts. It is unlikely that Sox30 was
lost in all the other teleosts except the primitive and
advanced species; 2) both fathead minnow and zebrafish
belong to the same family, Cyprinidae. It is difficult to
believe that Sox30 was secondarily lost in the zebrafish

Page 8 of 11

but not in another closely related species, fathead
minnow. Therefore, we tend to accept the former explanation. To confirm this, further cloning Sox30 from
other teleosts is required.
Sox30 was found not only in chordates such as
human, mouse, chicken, frog, tilapia, channel catfish,
guppy, fathead minnow, little skate, dogfish, sea squirts,
lancelets and acorn worm, but also in non-chordate
invertebrate species, such as the California mussel, snail
and sea anemone, indicating that it had already
appeared before or with the emergence of coelenterates.
Then, it is of interests to know from which ancestor
gene Sox30 was derived. Group H, which only consists
of Sox30, shared the highest similarity to group F in 10
Sox groups (Additional file 1, Fig.S1), suggesting that
they may share a common ancestor. However, the exact
timing for the divergence of the two groups is still
unclear. Its presence in the relatively primitive invertebrate species, sea anemones (no Sox30 or other Sox
genes have been found in protozoa and bacteria at present) and its position (the outermost clade) in the phylogenetic tree (Additional file 1, Fig. S1) suggested that
Sox30 seemed to be one of the oldest members in the
Sox family, which is consistent with the previous conclusion [28].
Sequence and gene structure analyses of Sox30

Compared with its counterparts from mammals, tilapia
Sox30 genomic sequence was smaller in size due to
compression of intron sequences. Similar phenomenon
has been found for Sox30 in sea squirts, lancelets and
acorn worm. Alignment of aa sequences indicated that
Sox30 s was poorly conserved, even in the highly conserved HMG-box among both distant and closely related
species, suggesting high diversity and rapid evolution of
these proteins. This also explains why Sox30 has not
been successfully isolated from non-mammalian animals
until the accident cloning of tilapia Sox30 in this study.
Gene structure analysis showed that tilapia Sox30, like
some other Sox group members, such as Sox8, Sox9 and
Sox10 [29], was also characterized by the splitting of the
HMG-box by an intron. The same is true to Sox30 of
acorn worm, lancelets, sea squirts, frog, chicken, mouse
and human, and the location of the intron is conserved
among these species. These findings indicated that this
intron had already been fixed before or with the emergence of chordates.
Alternative splicing (AS) is emerging as one of the
most important mechanisms to control vertebrate gene
expression. Existing data indicate that as much as 76%
of genes generate alternatively spliced products [30]. AS
has been associated with a regulatory system in tissueor stage-specific splicing mechanisms by which expression may be regulated. This regulation may be achieved

Han et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2010, 11:98
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/11/98

by the introduction of premature stop codons that
function as an on-off gene expression switch [31]. Previous study showed that two different mRNA isoforms
of Sox17, Sox30 have been isolated in mouse and two
different mRNA isoforms of Sox9 in frog because of AS
[15,16,32]. In mice, the Sox17 isoform is expressed at a
low level in the testis throughout postnatal development,
while the t-Sox17 isoform is expressed abundantly in the
testis, predominantly in postmeiotic germ cells [15].
Based on these results, they suggested that a switch
from Sox17 to the t-Sox17 isoform may alter the
function of Sox17 at the meiotic and postmeiotic phases
during spermatogenesis in mice [15]. Our data demonstrated that tilapia Sox30 has four alternatively spliced
isoforms. Early termination of the stop codon was found
in the isoform-II and -IV transcripts of tilapia Sox30,
suggesting that the mechanism mentioned above may be
also responsible for regulation of Sox30 gene expression
in tilapia. Besides, similar to mouse Sox17, four isoforms
of Sox30 were also expressed in a non-parallel manner
during gonadal development of tilapia. Thus, there may
be some switches from one to the other isoform(s) to
alter the function of Sox30 during gonadal development.
It is worthwhile to note that the HMG-box region was
deleted partially in isoform-III and completely in isoform-IV, respectively, which resulted in truncated proteins lacking most parts or all of the HMG-box domain
and the nuclear localization signal.
It is interesting to know whether these protein isoforms are ever made, but now there is no antibody
available because Sox30 is poorly conserved among species of different classes of animals, and therefore, the
available antibody against mammalian Sox30 is not suitable for usage in fish. There are reports showing that
alternatively spliced isoforms of Sox17 and Sox30, without functional DNA binding domain or C-terminus,
very similar to tilapia Sox30 isoforms, were translated
into proteins in mammals [15,16]. Based on those findings, we speculated that all isoforms of Sox30 in tilapia
may also be translated into the protein products. As
Sox30 gene, like Sry and some other Sox genes, uses the
single HMG-box for DNA-binding, it would be very
interesting to know what these truncated isoforms do
and how they function. Whether this would result in
different capacity of transcription activation, e.g. complete non-functional factors or dominant negative
mutants of the wild type Sox30, is still an open
question.
The expression pattern and functional relevance of Sox30
in tilapia

Previous reports in mammals showed that human and
mouse Sox30 are exclusively expressed in normal adult
testis and specifically in germ cells [16]. This expression

Page 9 of 11

pattern suggests that Sox30 may be involved in mammalian spermatogonial differentiation and spermatogenesis
[18] However, it is still unclear in which cell type Sox30
is expressed in the mammalian ovary even though there
was report indicating its possible expression in mouse
oocytes [33]. In the present study, Sox30 started to
express in gonads from 10 dah, earlier than the morphological gonadal differentiation period (about 25 dah) in
tilapia and showed a gonad specific expression pattern
at least in adults. Of course, expression of Sox30 in
extra-gonadal tissues in other stages of development
cannot be completely excluded. Meanwhile, expression
of each alternatively spliced isoform showed a clear sexual dimorphism in gonads. However, none of the four
isoforms of Sox30 were detected at 5 dah, the critical
period of tilapia molecular sex determination, which
excluded its role as the sex determining gene in tilapia.
In sex reversed adult gonads, three types of Sox30 also
exhibited a phenotypic sex-related expression pattern.
Sox30 expression was restricted to the germ cells at 10
dah and later to sperms in male gonads, indicating its
possible involvement in spermatogonial differentiation
and spermatogenesis in male fish, like in human and
mouse. In female, it was expressed in the somatic cells
in female gonads at 10, 120 and 210 dah, respectively.
Sox30 is a strong regulator of the Sf-1 [33], the most
important steroidogenic factor found in all vertebrates,
including fish [34,35]. Our in situ hybridization data
demonstrated clearly that Sox30 is expressed in the
somatic cells, especially steroidogenic cells of the ovary,
colocalized with Sf-1 in tilapia [34]. Taken together, we
speculate that Sox30 may be an important regulator for
somatic differentiation and steroidogenesis in female
fish as well. Both isoform I and IV are expressed in the
ovary after 35 dah. Although isoform IV is expressed
much higher than isoform I it lacks the DNA binding
HMG-box, and therefore, it is unlikely that this isoform
regulates Sf-1 expression by direct binding to the promoter. However, the possibility that isoform IV might
function as a dominant negative mutant of the wild type
molecule (isoform I) can not be excluded because it still
has the other functional domains, such as transactivation domain. More works need to be done to unravel
this.
In addition to the gonad specific expression of Sox30
in human, mouse and tilapia, all Sox30 EST sequences
were also derived from gonads (testis and ovary in
chicken and channel catfish, testis in frog, guppy and
fathead minnow, male gonads in snail) demonstrating
that Sox30 may also be a gonad specific gene in these
species. These data further supported that Sox30 plays a
key role in gonadal differentiation and development,
which might be conserved among species in the animal
kingdom. Moreover, four alternatively spliced Sox30

Han et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2010, 11:98
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/11/98

isoforms exhibited different temporal and spatial
expression patterns in tilapia gonads. Alternative splicing
of Sox30 mRNAs and different temporal expression pattern of the spliced isoforms had also been reported in
human and mouse [16]. Therefore, we speculate that
Sox30 may be involved in gonadal differentiation and
development in different sexes, at different stages and in
different cell types of gonads in the animal kingdom by
AS. Further study on Sox30 in other species is required to
confirm this.
The low similarity between tilapia Sox30 and its mammalian counterpart raises a question of whether tilapia
Sox30 is a genuine Sox30 or just a new Sox member of
the group H. To answer this, we analyzed the synteny of
Sox30 and its adjacent genes in human, mouse, chicken,
anole lizard and frog (tilapia was not included because
its genome sequences has not finished and open yet).
Sox30 and its adjacent gene Thg1l and Adam19 were
found to be located on the chromosome 5, 11, 13 and
scaffold_69 and _177 in human, mouse, chicken, anole
lizard and frog, respectively. The conservation in synteny between non-mammalian species and mammals
indirectly support that our isolated Sox30 s are genuine
orthologs of mammalian Sox30.

Conclusion
For the first time, Sox30 was found to exist in nonmammalian vertebrates and invertebrates by cloning,
genome and EST database analyses. The probable gonad
specific expression in all species analyzed and the temporal and spatial expression of the alternatively spliced
isoforms indicated that Sox30 may play a key role in
gonadal differentiation and development, and the function of Sox30 may be regulated by AS and expression in
different gender, different stages and different cell types
in gonads in a wide variety of animals.
