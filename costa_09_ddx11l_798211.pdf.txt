Abstract
Background: The subtelomeric regions of human chromosomes exhibit an extraordinary
plasticity. To date, due to the high GC content and to the presence of telomeric repeats, the
subtelomeric sequences are underrepresented in the genomic libraries and consequently their
sequences are incomplete in the finished human genome sequence, and still much remains to be
learned about subtelomere organization, evolution and function. Indeed, only in recent years,
several studies have disclosed, within human subtelomeres, novel gene family members.
Results: During a project aimed to analyze genes located in the telomeric region of the long arm
of the human X chromosome, we have identified a novel transcript family, DDX11L, members of
which map to 1pter, 2q13/14.1, 2qter, 3qter, 6pter, 9pter/9qter, 11pter, 12pter, 15qter, 16pter,
17pter, 19pter, 20pter/20qter, Xpter/Xqter and Yqter. Furthermore, we partially sequenced the
underrepresented subtelomeres of human chromosomes showing a common evolutionary origin.
Conclusion: Our data indicate that an ancestral gene, originated as a rearranged portion of the
primate DDX11 gene, and propagated along many subtelomeric locations, is emerging within
subtelomeres of human chromosomes, defining a novel gene family. These findings support the
possibility that the high plasticity of these regions, sites of DNA exchange among different
chromosomes, could trigger the emergence of new genes.

Background
Human subtelomeric sequences are extraordinarily
dynamic and variable regions near the ends of chromosomes, and represent the transition sites between chromosomes-specific sequences and telomeric repeats capping
each chromosomal end [1]. The unusual nucleotide com-

position of human subtelomeres was first evident from
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of
cloned segments of subtelomeric regions [2].
However, to date, the large variability of subtelomeric
sequences is underrepresented in the complete human

genome database, because of the low representation of
clones covering the proximity of these regions in the
libraries used in the Human Genome Project. Moreover,
the high level of polymorphism found in the human subtelomeres, makes assembling multiple different alleles of
the same chromosome more challenging than most of the
regions of human genome.

CHLR1-related helicase gene [5,17,18], the newly defined
transcript family, DDX11L, was disclosed in the subtelomeres of various human chromosomes. The identification
of this novel gene family and its spreading along the primate lineage, offers novel insights into our understanding
of subtelomeres dynamics, and into the emergence of a
multicopy transcript from an inactive pseudogene.

The comparative analysis of fully sequenced subtelomeres
of human 4p, 16p, 22q, Xq and Yq, has revealed a common structure, in which the proximal and distal subtelomeric domains are separated by a stretch of degenerate
TTAGGG repeats [3-6]. The subtelomeric repeats identified in these studies, often show a polymorphic chromosomal distribution, due to infrequent events of nonhomologous recombination that transfer irregular DNA
patches to some chromosomes but not to others [7]. Furthermore, the high rate of homology shared by some subtelomeric and centromeric sequences, indicates past
transfers of genomic material among these sites [8].

Although we have not yet defined a biological function for
the newly identified transcript family, we found that these
genomic regions are actively transcribed (in many human
tissues) and also undergo canonical splicing. To date, we
cannot define these transcriptionally active regions as
functional genes, but we cannot definitely exclude it. In
the paper the term "gene family" will be referred to "transcriptionally active regions family".

The analysis of subtelomeric sequences has shown that
these fragments are more than simple functionless DNA
spacer regions joining the telomere to chromosome-specific sequences [9]. Indeed, subtelomeres seem to be
involved in various processes such as homologous and
non-homologous chromosome recombination events,
and also in the telomere healing, consisting in telomere
elongation in the absence of telomerase [10,11]. It has
also been postulated that subtelomeres attenuate the telomere position effect (TPE), a gene-silencing phenomenon due to the heterochromatic state of telomeres
involving all the genes located in the proximity of the telomeres [12]. Furthermore, in addition to their structural
role, the subtelomeric regions of human chromosomes
contain many genes, members of several gene families
[13,14].
During the evolution of genomes, a huge number of new
genes have been created by gene-duplication events [14].
These processes are most commonly followed by one or
more mutational events that silence one member of the
pair, although they may alternatively undergo processes
of sub-functionalization or neo-functionalization. In the
former, both the pair members acquire degenerative
mutations reducing their pattern of splicing and their
activity compared to the single ancestral gene. The latter,
conversely, contributes to the creation of a gene family
with novel functions, as one gene accumulating mutations may acquire a different function, while the other
member still retains the original one [15,16].
In this paper we describe the characterization of a novel
multicopy transcript closely adjacent to TelBam3.4
derived sequences. Previously reported as a pseudogene of

Results
Genomic structure and localization of DDX11L genes
Our group has contributed to the full sequence project of
human X chromosome [19]. In our previous experiments
[5], we sequenced 400 kb of the subtelomeric region of
the long arm of human X chromosome (Xq-PAR) and the
related telomere sequence. During this work, the bioinformatics analysis revealed, within this genomic region, the
presence of 4 genes (SYBL1, HSPRY3, IL9R and CXYorf1,
currently named WASH) and 2 pseudogenes (AMD2p and
CHL1p).

A routine comparison of the previously identified CHL1p
pseudogene sequence with the available databases
revealed that this sequence shares high homology with
the sequence corresponding to CHLR1-related helicase
gene (DDX11 gene), mapping to 12p11 and 12p13, as
well as with human TelBam 3.4, telomere-associated
sequence [2,17].
A total of 14 spliced ESTs (AA663731, AI418732,

and BM920886) derived from multiple tissues, with
100% of sequence identity with the telomeric region of
the human Xq28, were detected. A resulting 1643 bp consensus cDNA sequence was aligned to the finished and
unfinished human genomic sequences (BLASTN at NCBI)
allowing us to determine the correct exon/intron structure
of this novel gene, named DDX11L16 from the HGNC
(HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee). The entire
DDX11L16 gene spans 2526 bp of genomic DNA and consists of three exons of 354 bp, 108 bp and 1180 bp respectively, separated by two intervening sequences of 385 bp
and 498 bp (see Figure 1A). All the identified donor and
acceptor splice sites sequences are in accordance with the
GT-AG rule [20]. In addition, the alignment of DDX11L16

cDNA to the fully sequenced subtelomeres of Xq, Yq, 16p,
15q, 1p, 9p chromosomes and the pericentromeric region
of human chromosome 2 (2q13/14.1) has shown the
presence of other DDX11L16 copies on these chromosomes. The bioinformatics analysis has revealed they have
the same telomere-to-centromere orientation, mapping
about 400 bp proximal to telomere associated region
(TAR) sequences at 5' end, while the 3' end overlaps a few
bp of the 3' end of WASH genes [14]. Furthermore, we
assessed, through PCR on DNAs from the monochromosomal somatic hybrids, the presence of this novel gene
also on human 3, 6, 17, 19 and 20 chromosomes, and
sequenced the DDX11L gene copies on each above-mentioned chromosome (accession numbers: AM992865,
AM992866, AM992867, AM992868 and AM992869). In
this way, we defined a novel gene family – the most telomeric ever identified – named DDX11L. The total number

of DDX11L gene copies ranges from 16 to 19 in the analyzed individuals (see the FISH analysis in the "DDX11L
genes are present in multiple copies in primates'
genomes" paragraph), even though these copies were collectively found in 18 different sites (see table 1).
All the sequences of DDX11L gene family members – both
known and sequenced during this work – were aligned.
The alignment revealed that these sequences contain
inter-chromosomal single base variations within exons
and introns. This analysis allowed us to detect a specific
haplotype for each analyzed chromosome, also revealing
the presence of a 12 bp deletion in the 3' end of
DDX11L16 gene in Xq/Yq region (see Figure 1B). The
sequence analysis also revealed the presence of different
open reading frames (ORF; data not shown). Furthermore, since the sequence alignment revealed that

DDX11L genes are distal to WASH genes, overlapping a
few bp within the fully sequenced subtelomeres of Xq, Yq,
16p, 15q, 1p, 9p and 2q13/14.1, we investigated whether
these two genes also overlapped in the subtelomeres of 3,
6, 11, 17, 19 and 20 human chromosomes.
To this purpose, we performed PCR amplifications on
DNA from the monochromosomal somatic hybrids, using
a primer in the WASH genes coding region and the other
within DDX11L genes. Thus, by direct sequencing of PCR
fragments, we demonstrated the genomic proximity of the
newly identified DDX11L genes with the WASH gene family members [14], also located within the subtelomeres of
the above-mentioned human chromosomes (Figure 2A).
Expression analysis of DDX11L genes
We detected the expression of the DDX11L gene family
members on 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 human
autosomes, using a semiquantitative RT-PCR on RNAs
extracted from the monochromosomal somatic hybrid
cell lines [see Additional file 1]. Expression analysis
revealed the presence of an alternatively spliced transcript,
a short splice variant of 1481 bp in the DDX11L9,
DDX11L11 and DDX11L12 genes, on 15, 17 and 19 chromosomes, respectively (see Figure 1B; accession ns.
AM992880, AM992881 and AM992878). Sequence analysis revealed that the short splice variant consists of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/250

entire exon 1, an exon 2, 18 bp longer at the 3' end, and
an exon 3, 180 bp shorter at the 5'. These newly identified
donor and acceptor splice sites are in accordance with the
GT-AG rule [20]. A significant ORF of 402 bp in the
DDX11L9 short splice variant – ATG located at the position 317 and TAG at the position 718 – was found, encoding a putative protein of 133 aminoacids significantly
homologous (up to 88%) to DDX11 protein. Similarly, it
was found a 336 bp ORF in the DDX11L11 short splice
variant – ATG at the position 383 and TAG at the position
718 – encoding a putative protein of 111 aminoacids.
Conversely, we found a significant, but shorter, ORF of
270 bp in the DDX11L12 splice variant, with the ATG at
the position 734 and the TAG at the position 1003. This
transcript encodes a putative protein of 89 aminoacids,
with a high sequence identity (up to 80%) in the N-terminal region of DDX11 protein (aminoacids 1–36). On the
opposite, no significant similarity with known proteins in
the C-terminal region was detected. We have, therefore,
identified at least 3 potentially intact DDX11L variants
(with different ORFs), and it is likely that some of these
may have slightly different functions, although we have
no evidence for positive selection in mammalian
DDX11L1 genes. Moreover, a deeper sampling would be
required to account for all identified gene copies.

Furthermore, to assess the expression pattern of the
DDX11L genes, we carried out an RT-PCR analysis –
amplifying a product of 976 bp – on RNAs derived from 8
human tissues and 4 different human cell lines (three of
them from stabilized cancers). This analysis revealed that
the DDX11L genes are ubiquitously expressed with no
detectable expression only in retinoblastoma (Y79) and
HeLa cell lines (see Figure 2B).
The assessment of sex – and chromosome-specific –
expression was attempted using oligonucleotide primer
pairs designed across a cDNA-specific sequence, in the
hybrid cells employed to analyze DDX11L16. The gene
expression was detected in three hybrids containing active
X (GM06318B), inactive X (THX88) and Y (GM06317)
chromosome, already used for inactivation experiments
[21]. The expression analysis confirmed, as awaited for its
localization in the PAR2 of X and Y human chromosomes,
that DDX11L16 escapes from X inactivation and has an
active homolog on the human Y chromosome (Figure
2C).
DDX11L genes are present in multiple copies in primates'
genomes
Recent comparisons among human and other primates
genome, have revealed the presence of evolutionarily conserved sequences – syntenic regions – usually related to
functional portions of the genome, such as protein-coding
genes as well as non-genic sequences, probably with regulatory and structural functions [22,23]. To investigate the
conservation of DDX11L genes along the primate evolution, human sequences obtained from direct sequencing
of each DDX11L gene copy (see "Genomic structure and
localization of DDX11L genes" section) and from the
public databases (NCBI), were aligned with the sequences
derived from BLAST analysis on chimpanzee, rhesus and
orangutan genomes, using ClustalW algorithm. The analysis revealed that the human DDX11L genes have a high
degree of conservation along primates, showing up to
98% of sequence homology to subtelomeric sequences
from chromosomes XI and XIV of chimpanzee, and 91%
with the subtelomeric sequences from chromosome 13 of
rhesus. No DDX11L homologous were found in the orangutan genome assembly. Both in chimpanzee and in rhesus, the DDX11L homologous genes revealed to overlap –
as already shown in the humans – a gene homologous to
the human WASH in the PAR2 of the X chromosome.

In addition, the human DDX11L gene family members
showed a significant sequence similarity with the DDX11
homologous gene of chimpanzee and rhesus on chromosomes IIp and 11, respectively.
Since the subtelomeric regions of non-human primate
genomes do not have a comprehensive coverage, there

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/250

may be some non-human primate DDX11L gene copies
that will be missing in this kind of analysis. Thus, to avoid
this, and to better evaluate the presence of DDX11L genes
along the primate lineage, also confirming the subtelomeric localization within human chromosomes, a comparative FISH analysis was performed against metaphase
chromosomal spreads of Homo sapiens (HSA), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes, PTR), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla, GGO),
and orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus, PPY). A fragment of
about 1,9 kb, corresponding to the exons 2 and 3 of
DDX11L3, was amplified from a somatic hybrid cell line
containing human chromosome 3 as the only human
contribution, and was used as FISH probe (see Methods).
Due to the highly polymorphic nature of the subtelomeric
regions, the experiments were performed in metaphases
from three different human individuals. When available
(PTR and PPY), two distinct primate individuals were
used. Examples of the FISH experiments are reported in
Figure 3. Distinct hybridization signals were detected on
the human chromosomes 2q13/14.1, 2qter, 3qter, 6pter,
9pter/9qter, 11pter, 12 pter, 15qter, 19pter, 20pter/20
qter, Xpter/Xqter, and Yqter. The 2q13/14.1 boundary
corresponds to the region where the two short arm telomeres of the ancestral IIp and IIq acrocentric chromosomes
fused to generate the human chromosome 2 [24]. Polymorphic rearrangements were detected on chromosomes
2, 9, and X. Thus, we cannot exclude that new intact copies
of DDX11L genes might be found at other chromosomal
ends in other individuals, since the subtelomeres undergo
frequent inter-chromosomal sequence exchange [9].
Hybridization signals, using the same FISH probe, were
also detected in the subtelomeres of chromosomes XII
and XX of PTR, and in the subtelomeres of GGO chromosomes III, VI, XII, and XX (Figure 3), providing a relevant
clue to the duplication events of large DNA patches
occurred in the evolution of primates (see Discussion).
No signals were detected in the orangutan metaphase
chromosomes, confirming the in silico BLAST observation.
These data confirm the duplicated nature of the subtelomeric regions of human chromosomes, and clearly indicate
that this gene emerged along the great apes lineage.

Discussion
The subtelomeric regions of human chromosomes exhibit
a dynamic nature and share wide regions of homology
among them, providing an opportunity for non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) [9-11]. These regions are also
involved in the attenuation of telomere position effect,
demonstrated in yeast and some human cell lines
[12,25,26]. In addition to a structural role, the subtelomeres of human chromosomes contain many gene families,
mostly originated from duplication events [13,14].

Project final release (NCBI Build 36.1). Examples of polymorphic rearrangments detected on human chromosomes are underlined (2, 9, and X). Note that chimpanzee and gorilla have large blocks of very telomeric, complex heterochromatic sequences
[39]. The DDX11L signals appear to map centromerically with respect to these blocks.

The process of birth of a novel gene comprises initial
mutational events – that give rise to new gene structure –
followed by an evolutionary process in which the new
gene structure becomes fixed in the species, and then it is
improved for a new function [27]. Processes of exon shuffling (i.e. alternative splicing), retro-transposition, and
gene duplication are the major mechanisms for generating novel genes, fixating the advantageous novelties. In
many cases the emergence of a novel gene/function may
be triggered for instance by some environmental variations [5,28].
We previously reported the presence of a pseudogene,
CHL1p, within the subtelomeric region of the long arm of
human X chromosome [29]. Since evidence has been
found in Drosophila, in mouse, and recently in humans,
of pseudogene functionality as well as of conservation
[30-32], we were encouraged to investigate whether this
region contained transcriptionally active sequences.
The DDX11L gene family members derive from a rearranged portion of the primate DDX11 gene (alias CHLR1,

homologous to CHL helicase of Saccaromyces Cerevisiae),
propagated among many subtelomeric locations (see
table 1) as part of a segmental duplication [18]. The
human subtelomeric DDX11L genes show up to 98,5%
sequence identity with the exons 18 and 22–25, and the 3'
UTR of DDX11 gene. The finding that DDX11L is a novel
multicopy gene family present in different human and
primate subtelomeres, and that all the identified gene
copies undergo canonical splicing mechanism – and are
also transcribed (at least in humans) – suggests this gene
is emerging from an inactive pseudogene, and is probably
undergoing a neo-functionalization process [18]. Therefore, this gene system may provide a valuable opportunity
to investigate the emergence of a novel gene and a novel
function in the recent human evolution.
Sequence comparison of the human DDX11L genes with
the available databases, has shown the high degree of evolutionary conservation of this novel genes along the primates genomes, also revealing that these genes lie in
proximity of WASH genes, within subtelomeres of many
primates chromosomes.

Particularly, the WASH genes – pseudo and intact genes –
were found in 16 different sites in human genome [14],
and we have demonstrated that DDX11L and WASH
genes co-localize within all described loci. DDX11L genes
were found only in the primates, whereas WASH genes
show orthologs in the vertebrates, flies, worms, slime
mold, and entamoeba. The creation of a genomic block of
about 8 kb, containing DDX11L-WASH genes (telomere
to centromere orientation), occurred in the telomeres of a
common ancestor of the humans and chimpanzee, in a
period ranging from 65 to 8 million years ago (mya), after
the evolutionary divergence of rodents and cat species
from primates, and before the recombination event that
created the PAR2 on the Y human chromosome. This
multi-step hypothesis is strongly supported by the evidence that DDX11L emerged as novel gene family only in
the primate genomes, and is completely absent in the wallaby, rodents and cat genomes [29]. Moreover, the presence of this genomic block on the primate X
chromosome, and even on the Y chromosome of humans,
strengthens this theory. The presence of the DDX11LWASH block in the terminal regions of chromosomes in
different individuals, provides clues about the history of
its spreading through the genome, and throughout
human populations.
DDX11L genes originated from an exon rearrangement of
an ancestral DDX11 gene, that moved to the subtelomeric
region of the long arm of an ancestral ape chromosome –
adjacently to the WASH gene – from which originated the
gene copy located on chromosome 12 [5,18,29]. The
hypothesis is supported by the fact that all the sequenced
DDX11L gene copies have the same telomere-to-centromere orientation, suggesting a common origin from an
ancestral DDX11L copy. The presence of at least 18
DDX11L gene family members in the human chromosome pairs, compared to six copies on the PTR chromosomes (IIp, XI, XII, XIV, XX and on the sexual X
chromosome), four in GGO (III, VI, XII and XX) and two
in Rhesus macaca (13 and sexual X chromosome), provides
a clear example of a multi-step evolutionary scenario, with
the evidence that DDX11L gene has duplicated, and then
moved, in different subtelomeric regions of human chromosomes in the time (about 8-5 mya) since chimpanzees
and humans diverged. Subsequently, the major spreading
of these sequences occurred throughout the human
genome evolution (Figure 4). This process is still in
progress, as these regions are highly polymorphic and
show the highest rate of recombination overall the
genome. Brown et al. [2] first discovered subtelomeric variability in the humans, demonstrating that some human
subtelomeric block, analysed by FISH in more than one
individual, showed variation in copy number and chromosomal location [2,9]. The human DDX11L genes are at
high risk for genomic rearrangements, such as deletions or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/250

translocations. Thus, since we have detected polymorphic
rearrangements by the analysis of only three unrelated
human individuals, on three different chromosomes, we
cannot exclude that other intact or partial copies of
DDX11L genes might be identified within telomeres of
other individuals.
Because of DDX11L proximity to the TAR (about 400 bp),
it is clear that the telomere length, as well as the somatic
variation in telomere organization, could greatly affect the
expression of DDX11L genes. On the other hand, as
hypothesized by Linardopoulou et al. (2005), subtelomeric dynamics might give a contribution to the normal
human phenotypic variation and, more generally, to the
diversification of these gene families [14].
Although we have identified at least 3 potentially translated DDX11L ORFs, with putative different aminoacid
sequence and function, we cannot exclude that the transcripts may exert an unknown regulatory function. It has
been shown that the genes encoding evolutionarily conserved protein, duplicated in multiple sites along primate
genomes, might contribute to interspecies phenotypic differences [14]. The subtelomeric gene dosage changes, and
the rapid genetic shuffling within these regions, may have
important evolutionary consequences [8,33,34]. For
instance, the telomeres maintenance pathways, mostly
influenced by the recombination, could be affected by differential subtelomeric structure, sequence organization
and copy number variation [35].

Conclusion
Our data provide an additional clue to the duplication
and the evolution of the human subtelomeres, confirming
the high degree of plasticity of these regions, continuously
involved in processes of genomic rearrangements and
novel gene creation. The identification of a novel gene
family emerging from human subtelomeric regions, and
the evidence that an ancestral DNA patch has duplicated
and then moved through the primates genomes in different ways and times, provide useful resources for a better
understanding of the subtelomeres dynamics. However,
additional targeted efforts are necessary to examine in
depth the subtelomeric regions, in order to gain a complete understanding of the subtelomere evolution and
functioning. Moreover, since their localization within
highly dynamic human subtelomeric regions greatly predisposes these genes to rearrangements (duplications,
deletions), DDX11L may contribute to normal human
variation as well as to pathology.
Further detailed characterization of the DDX11L protein
function(s), and an extensive genetic population analysis,
will be needed to rule out the occurrence and the frequency of variant subtelomeric alleles, which could have

advantageous, as well as detrimental or pathological, consequences on human health.

Methods
Similarity searches, EST alignments and protein prediction
BLAST searches in dbEST, assembly of ESTs and editing of
consensus sequence was performed using Autoassembler
program (ABI). Genomic similarity searches were per-

formed at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST. All
sequence alignments were performed using ClustalW
algorithm. Exon prediction from genomic sequences was
confirmed using AceView Gene, GeneScan and Vega Pseudogenes at Genome Browser web site http://
genome.ucsc.edu. The analysis of coding sequences was
performed using ORF Finder program http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html. Protein sequence

similarity searches were performed at NCBI against nonredundant protein databases.
Sequence analysis
Sequencing of the IMAGE cDNA clones, PCR and RT-PCR
products were performed using the dye terminator chemistry (Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing II kit, Applied
Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the user
manual instructions and analysed using an automated
sequencer (ABI 3100; Applied Biosystem, Foster City,
CA).
Cell culture
Hamster/mouse-human somatic cell hybrids, containing
each a different human chromosome, were cultured in
DMEM/F12. For a list of somatic cell hybrids used in the
present work, see Additional file 1.
PCR and RT-PCR analysis
For semi-quantitative RT-PCR, total RNA from eight
human tissues (brain, liver, skeletal muscle, heart, kidney,
stomach, breast and colon) was purchased from Clontech.
Total RNA from an RPE cell line, ARPE-19, lymphoblastoid (LCL), Y79 and teratocarcinoma cell lines were isolated by RNAzol B (Campro Scientific) and treated with
Dnase I (Gibco/BRL). Semiquantitative RT-PCRs were
performed as described [36]. A 5 g aliquot of tissue RNA,
isolated as previous described [37], was used for reverse
transcription carried out using random hexanucleotide
primers and SUPERSCRIPT III (Gibco BRL) in a 20 l reaction according to provided protocol. PCR with DDX11Lspecific primers was performed using 1 l of the reverse
transcription reaction as template in either a standard
PCR reaction set-up with AmpliTaq Gold (Perkin Elmer).
In each experiment, a sample without reverse transcriptase
was amplified under the same conditions as the reversetranscribed RNA. PCR products were purified from agarose gels by the QIAGEN Gel extraction Kit and directly
sequenced on an automated sequencer using the ABIPRISM big-dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction
kit (Applied Biosystem). Oligonucleotide primers used in
RT-PCR experiments were CHLRTF (5'-TTC TGG CCC
CTG TTG TCT GC-3'), CHL1F (5'-GGG AAA GAT TGG
AGG AAA GAT-3'), CHL1R (5'-ATT TCT CAC TGC CTT
TTG TCT G-3'), CHL2F (5'-AGT TCA CTC CTG CCT TTT
CCT T-3'), CHL3F (5'-CTT GCC GTC AGC CTT TTC TTT
G-3'), CHL3R (5'-ACT GAC CCC GAC ACG TTT GCA T3').

We used this primer pair in order to cover a genomic
region with the highest sequence similarity among human
autosomes. Metaphase preparations were obtained from
lymphoblastoid or fibroblast cell lines of the following
species: human (Homo sapiens, HSA), common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes, PTR), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla, GGO),
Borneo orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus, PPY). Three
different human individuals were examined. FISH experiments were performed essentially as described by Lichter
et al. [38] with minor modifications. Digital images were
obtained using a Leica DMRXA2 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a cooled CCD camera (Princeton
Instruments, NJ, USA). Cy3 and DAPI fluorescence signals, detected with specific filters, were recorded separately as gray-scale images. Pseudocoloring and merging
of images were performed using Adobe Photoshop software.
