Abstract
Background: Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) are a source of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) that can be used to
develop molecular markers for genetic studies. The availability of ESTs for Quercus robur and Quercus petraea
provided a unique opportunity to develop microsatellite markers to accelerate research aimed at studying
adaptation of these long-lived species to their environment. As a first step toward the construction of a SSR-based
linkage map of oak for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, we describe the mining and survey of EST-SSRs as
well as a fast and cost-effective approach (bin mapping) to assign these markers to an approximate map position.
We also compared the level of polymorphism between genomic and EST-derived SSRs and address the
transferability of EST-SSRs in Castanea sativa (chestnut).
Results: A catalogue of 103,000 Sanger ESTs was assembled into 28,024 unigenes from which 18.6% presented
one or more SSR motifs. More than 42% of these SSRs corresponded to trinucleotides. Primer pairs were designed
for 748 putative unigenes. Overall 37.7% (283) were found to amplify a single polymorphic locus in a reference fullsib pedigree of Quercus robur. The usefulness of these loci for establishing a genetic map was assessed using a bin
mapping approach. Bin maps were constructed for the male and female parental tree for which framework linkage
maps based on AFLP markers were available. The bin set consisting of 14 highly informative offspring selected
based on the number and position of crossover sites. The female and male maps comprised 44 and 37 bins, with
an average bin length of 16.5 cM and 20.99 cM, respectively. A total of 256 EST-SSRs were assigned to bins and
their map position was further validated by linkage mapping. EST-SSRs were found to be less polymorphic than
genomic SSRs, but their transferability rate to chestnut, a phylogenetically related species to oak, was higher.
Conclusion: We have generated a bin map for oak comprising 256 EST-SSRs. This resource constitutes a first step
toward the establishment of a gene-based map for this genus that will facilitate the dissection of QTLs affecting
complex traits of ecological importance.

Background
Catalogues of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) are
developed from cDNA libraries to obtain expressional
sequence information in contrasting environmental conditions or across developmental stages. When available,
they also offer an inexpensive source of gene-based
DNA markers, in particular SSRs [1]. Such collections of

ESTs were produced in several plants providing a
unique opportunity for searching SSR motifs and further
develop the corresponding microsatellite markers [2].
Alternative and promising strategies to develop SSR
markers from genome shotgun sequencing have recently
emerged with the development of new generation
sequencing technologies [3]. However, because ESTs
correspond to coding DNA, the flanking sequences of
EST-SSRs are located in well-conserved regions across
phylogenetically related species, making them markers

of choice for comparative mapping and relevant functional and positional candidate genes to study their colocation with quantitative trait loci (QTLs).
The construction of a high resolution genetic map
populated with SSRs requires considerable efforts,
including the development of several hundreds of markers (depending on the number of linkage groups) and
the genotyping of a large number of plants to ensure
that most of the markers are correctly ordered, i.e. with
a high LOD support for local ordering. Alternatively,
bin-mapping or selective mapping [4] offers a less accurate but faster and cost-effective approach to locate
many markers on an already existing framework map.
This mapping strategy consists of genotyping a subset of
highly informative offspring (the bin set) that are
selected based on the number and position of crossover
sites. In brief, the optimal bin set of a given size presents the maximum number of breaking points evenly
spaced throughout the map, ideally resulting in a number of bins that is close to the number of framework
marker intervals. This approach has been used successfully in peach [5], melon [6], strawberry [7] and apple
[8,9]. Here, we use this approach for the first time in a
forest tree species: oak.
Oaks represent a major component of the northern
hemisphere forest. In particular, pedunculate (Quercus
robur L.) oak is widely spread throughout Europe, from
Spain to Russia (Ural mountains). This species is associated with important environmental (carbon sequestration, water cycle, reservoir of biodiversity...) and
economic (carpentry, furniture, cabinet making, veneer,
cask industry, fuel wood, hunting and fungus gathering)
services. It has been used for years to study the genetic
architecture of forest tree adaptation through common
garden experiments [10,11], where natural populations
growing in their native environments have been transplanted in a common environment, and QTL mapping
studies [12-16], as well as to decipher the molecular
mechanisms underlying adaptive traits such as bud phenology [17], water-use efficiency [18] and response to
root hypoxia [15].
Different types of molecular markers were developed
in Q. robur for linkage mapping to study the genetic
architecture of adaptive traits. The different versions of
the map included hundreds of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers [19], amplified fragment
length polymorphisms (AFLP) [12] markers, and a set of
56 simple sequence repeats obtained from enriched
genomic libraries (gSSRs) [20]. Because of their highly
polymorphic nature and high degree of transferability
across species, SSRs proved to be very useful markers to
align different maps of Q. robur as well as to initiate a
comparative mapping analysis with Castanea sativa
(chestnut), another important Fagaceae species [20,21].

Despite combining interesting features (typically codominant and multiallelic, high polymorphism information content, evenly distributed throughout the genome,
and high reproducibility) too few SSRs have been yet
made available in oak to advance to more detailed
genetic studies. The high cost associated with their
development from enriched genomic libraries [22] and
the lack of sequences for the genus Quercus genus probably contributed to the delay of the construction of a
large battery of SSRs.
In this context, the main objectives of this study were:
i/ to screen the oak ESTs for SSR motifs (i.e. type, frequency, and distribution of SSR motifs), ii/ to develop a
set of EST-SSR markers and compile the data in a dedicated database, iii/ to compare their polymorphism
information content with gSSR, iv/ to test the transferability of these markers in chesnut and v/ to map as
much SSR loci as possible on two parental framework
linkage maps of Q. robur using a bin-mapping approach.
This study constitutes the first step toward the establishment of a consensus linkage map for oak based on
SSRs segregating in several mapping populations.

Results
SSR mining and EST-SSRs frequency

SSRs were searched among the 28,024 unigene elements
obtained from the assembly of 103,000 ESTs into 13,477
contigs and 14,547 singletons, using STACKpack™. The
search was performed for di- (with a repeat count n ≥ 5
repeat units), tri- (n ≥ 4), tetra- (n ≥ 3), penta- (n ≥ 3)
and hexa- (n ≥ 3) nucleotides, using the mreps software
[23]. A total of 3,893 unigene elements contained at least
one SSRs, resulting into 5,218 microsatellites, ie. a SSR
frequency of 18.6%, taking into account multiple occurrences of SSRs in some unigene elements. As expected,
the most frequent type of microsatellites corresponded to
trimeric SSRs (2,212 unigene elements, i.e. 42% of the
detected SSRs). This was followed by dimeric (1,713,
34%) and hexameric (574, 11%) SSRs. The abundance of
tetrameric and pentameric SSRs was lower, representing
only 8% and 5% of the microsatellites, respectively. The
size of the SSR string varied from 10 bp (5 repeats for dinucleotide motifs) to 132 bp (66 repeats for an AG SSR)
and the average number of repeats were 8.8 for dimeric
(see additional file 1- table S1 for the distribution), 5 for
trimeric (48.8% with 4 repeats), 3.5 for tetrameric (65.6%
with 6 repeats), 3.2 for pentameric (81.2% with 3 repeats),
and 3.4 for hexameric (72.5% with 3 repeats) SSRs.
Among the dimeric SSRs, AG was found as the most
common motif (70%), followed by AT (19%), AC (10.5%)
and CG (0.1%). Similarly, for trimeric SSRs, the most
common motifs were AAG (28%), ACC (14%) and AAC
(12.4%). For the three other classes, the most common
SSR types corresponded to AAAN (for tetrameric SSRs),

Durand et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:570
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/570

AAAAN (for pentameric SSRs), and AAAAAN (for hexameric SSRs). All these SSRs were made available in additional file 1 - table S1, which compiles information such
as number of repeats, size of the motif, annotation etc.
Distribution of EST-SSRs

For 86% of the 5,218 SSRs, ESTscan [24] succeeded in
estimating whether SSRs were located in non-coding
(untranslated) (41.8%, including 21.5% di-, 8.5% tri2.8% hexa-SSRs) vs. coding (translated) (43.3%, including
2.2% di-, 31.3% tri- 7.5% hexa-SSRs) regions of each
EST. The occurrence of each category in coding and
non-coding regions is shown in Figure 1a. Overall,
67.3% and 32.7% of the non-coding SSRs were located
at 5’- and 3’-UTR, respectively. Using FrameDP, 83% of
the 5,218 SSRs was estimated in at least one predicted
peptide (Figure 1b). As ESTScan, FrameDP prediction
showed that smaller numbers of SSRs were located in
non-coding (37.4%, including 14.6% di-, 11.1% tri- 3.7%
hexa-SSRs) compared to coding regions (47.9%, including 11.4% di-, 27.5% tri- and 6.2% hexa-SSRs). Overall,
53.8% and 46.2% of the non-coding SSRs were located
at the 5’- and 3’- UTRs, respectively. The most remarkable result obtained by FrameDP was the increased ratio
of SSRs predicted in coding regions (from 43.3% to
47.9%), that can be attributed to a higher frequency
among dinucleotide motifs compared to ESTscan.
Marker development

Of the 5,218 SSRs motifs identified, we designed primer
pairs for 748 SSRs (additional file 2 - table S1), including 348 di-, 320 tri-, 2 tetra-, 1 penta-, and 77 hexanucleotide SSRs. Locus ID, forward and reverse primer

sequences, type of motif and length, amplification and
polymorphism in the tested full-sib pedigree have been
reported in additional file 3 - table S1. A total of 568
primer pairs (75.8%) amplified a PCR product, among
which 283 (154 di-, 107 tri-, 1 tetra-, 1 penta- and 20
hexa-nucleotide SSRs) were found to amplify a single
polymorphic locus, i.e. 37.7% of the total number of
tested primers. It was also found that the level of polymorphism depended on the type of motif (Figure 2).
These loci segregated in the testcross configuration, i.e.
1:1 ratio (65 loci in the male and 77 loci in the female
parent), or in the intercross configuration, i.e. 1:1:1:1
ratio (135 loci in both parents) or 1:2:1 ratio (6 loci in
both parents). Markers segregating 1:1:1:1 were recoded
in the 1:1 ratio in the male and female parents.
Transferability of EST-SSRs

A subset of oak EST-SSRs were also tested for their
transferability in chestnut (Castanea sativa) another
important Fagaceae species. A total of 100 dinucleotide
EST-SSRs were tested for their amplification on two
DNA specimen (additional file 4 - table S1), from which
63% amplified a single PCR product, a figure that is significantly higher than that obtained for the transferability of dinucleotide genomic SSRs from oak to chestnut,
i.e. 47% in [20]. In addition, electronic PCR was carried
out against unigene elements for Quercus mongolica
(Qm) [25] and Castanopsis sieboldii (Cs) [26]. There
were 52 oak primer pairs that amplified Qm with no
mismatch and product size similar to that for European
oaks. Six primer pairs amplified two different Qm
sequences. For Cs, there were 18 primer pairs that can
amplify Cs with no mismatch. One primer pair

amplified two different Cs sequences. Seven primer pairs
produced ePCR products for both Qm and Cs. Three
primer pairs in the present study targeted three unigene
elements for which SSR markers were already developed
for Qm.
Comparison between genomic and EST-derived SSRs

A total of 16 dinucleotide genomic SSRs from Alberto
et al. [27] and 16 dinucleotide EST-SSRs (from this
study) were genotyped on the same set of 288 Q. petraea
genotypes described in [27]. The comparison (taking into
account heterogeneous sample size using the rarefaction
methods from El Mousadik and Petit, [28] of genetic
diversity (He) and allelic richness (A) showed that gSSRs
were more polymorphic (He = 0.82 A = 4.34) than ESTSSRs (He = 0.77 and A = 3.78). Other diversity statistics
as the size range of the SSR motifs and the number of
alleles confirmed the lower level of polymorphism of
EST-SSRs compared to gSSRs. The size of the SSR motif
was on average 46.75 bp for gSSRs and 26.25 bp for ESTSSRs. The total number of alleles present in the tested
population, regardless of their frequency was 21.06 vs. for
gSSRs and 12.25 bp for EST-SSRs
Bin mapping

The two parental maps established by Saintagne et al.
[12] using Mapmaker 2.0 [29] were first reconstructed
(Figure 2) using Joinmap v4.0 [30] based on the same
128 framework markers and 278 progenies. The female

map was covered by 38 AFLPs, 6 RAPDs and 28 gSSRs
resulting in 63 marker intervals spanning 728.8 cM. The
male map was divided by 60 marker intervals and comprised 43 AFLPs, 4 RAPDs and 23 gSSRs for a total
map length of 776.9 cM. Each linkage map consisted in
12 linkage groups that corresponded to the number of
haploid chromosomes in oak. Compared to the map
previously constructed using Mapmaker, very few differences were noticed, consisting mainly in few inversions
(ZQR5a and E-AAC/M-CAC-202/3 on LG8F, E-AAG/
M-CTA-150/5 and E-AAC/M-CTT-120 on LG4M) and
three unlinked markers (E-AAG/M-CTT-168 on LG10F,
and E-AAG/M-CTT-363 on LG10M and P-CCA/MATA-335 on LG12M). The total map lengths were however quite different (929 vs. 728.8 cM for the female
map and 890 vs. 776.9 cM for the male map, using
Mapmaker and Joinmap, respectively). Similar results
have been reported elsewhere (e.g. [31] and [32]) and is
attributed to the method used by the software to calculate Kosambi genetic distances.
Using the bin set of 14 offsprings, the framework
maps were divided into 44 and 37 bins resulting in an
average bin length of 16.5 cM and 20.9 cM for the
female and male map, respectively. Double crossingovers were taken into account to define the bin set in
order to minimize the effect of possible genotyping
errors. The longest bins identified spanned 38.1 cM (bin
10.2) for the female and 79.9 cM (bin 5.1) for the male
map. On average, there were 1.88 and 1.80 different

Durand et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:570

genotypic points between contiguous bins in the female
and male maps. Therefore, more genotypic combinations might exist to fit within intermediate positions.
A total of 283 polymorphic EST-SSRs were genotyped
on the bin set and the parents of the full- sib pedigree
(Figures 3, 4). Overall 256 markers were assigned by graphical genotyping (i.e. graphical representation of genotypic information for individual genotypes as defined by

Page 5 of 13

Young and Tanksley [33]) to their respective bin. The
remaining 27 markers corresponded either to markers segregating 1:2:1 (6 loci) or presented ambiguous bin positions (21 loci) and were therefore left out from the
analysis. On the female map, 198 markers were assigned
to bins, giving an average of 4.5 markers per bins ranging
from 0 (bin 5.1, 6.3, 9.5) to 18 (bin 2.6). On the male map,
185 markers were assigned to bins, giving an average of 5

markers per bin ranging from 0 (bin 3.2, 4.2, 4.4, 10.2) to
22 (bin 6.1). Overall, EST-SSRs were evenly distributed
across the linkage groups. More precisely, respectively 69
and 78 markers for the female and the male map presented exactly the same genotypic information as bin framework markers, i.e. these markers were positioned at the
same location as the markers used for the definition of
bins. The others, 104 and 86 markers in the female and in
the male map, respectively, were positioned in the bins,
presenting a genotype that was compatible with an intermediate bin between two successive bin markers. This is

likely the result of large average bin size defined over low
marker density framework maps. Only 25 and 21 markers
in the female and male maps were involved in one or
more double crossing-overs, respectively. Their genotypes
were double checked, confirming this observation. These
markers were visually assigned to their most probable
bins.
Validation of bin assignment

To test the efficiency of bin mapping, we first compare
the known map location of 19 accessory gSSRs (blue

type in Figures 3, 4) from the map constructed by
Barreneche et al. [20], to their bin positions inferred
from the graphical genotyping of 14 F1s. In all cases,
both approaches agreed (additional file 5 - table S1), i.e.
markers were located either on the same bin (18 markers of class A according to the categories presented in
the methods section) or an adjacent bin (1 marker of
class B: ZQR49). An a posteriori validation was also performed for 146 EST-SSRs (on the female map 47 markers corresponding exactly to bin markers and 54
markers characterized with ambiguous position, on the
male map 47 markers corresponding exactly to bin markers and 47 markers characterized with ambiguous position) genotyped on 46 progenies. On the female map,
77 markers showed identical positions between bin
assignment and map location (class A), 12 were located
in an adjacent bin (class B), 1 was mapped on the same
linkage group (class C), and 11 presented a LOD score
for linkage < 2 (class D). Overall, the bin assignment
was validated for 89% of the markers (class A+B). For
the male map, 72, 11, 0 and 11 markers were of class A,
B, C and D, respectively, corresponding to a validation
rate of 88%. A slightly higher validation rate was
obtained for another set of 65 EST-SSRs (53 inter-cross,
7 female and 5 male test-cross markers) genotyped on
92 offsprings, i.e. 98.3% on the female map (53 A, 6 B
and 1 D markers), 94.8% on the male map (51 A, 2 B,
2C and 3 D markers).
Macro-synteny and colinearity

About the conservation of macro-synteny between the
male and female maps, it should be noticed that all the
129 inter-cross markers (indicated in bold in Figures 3,
4) were found on homologous linkage groups. A conserved macro-colinearity was also verified based on the
55 inter-cross markers (21 gSSRs and 34 EST-SSRs)
genotyped on the extended set of 92 progenies. These
markers presented the same order on both maps as illustrated in additional file 6 - figure S1, but with one
exception on LG9. Given the number of comparisons, 2
occurrences with different orders were expected by
chance alone at a 5% type I error rate. This investigation
also provided the opportunity to test whether the male
and female gametes presented different levels of recombination. Based on 33 intervals flanked by the same
adjacent markers in the male and female maps, no statistical difference was found using a t-test for paired
comparisons (data not shown).

Discussion
Frequency, distribution and polymorphism of the oak
EST-SSRs

EST-derived SSRs have been searched for many years in
plant, animal and microbial species. Despite a lower rate

Page 7 of 13

of polymorphisms compared to genomic SSRs (confirmed in the present study), EST-SSRs offer a number
of advantages over genomic SSRs [2]: (i) their development requires no investment in de novo sequencing; (ii)
they detect variation in the expressed portion of the
genome; (iii) the conservation of primer sites makes
them readily transferable across closely related species
as illustrated here between oak and chestnut; and (iv) in
most cases they can be exploited for population genetic
analysis [1].
The number of SSRs detected in ESTs largely depends
on the size of the EST catalogue, the algorithm [34] and
criteria (type of repeat motif and minimum number of
repeat units) used to detect SSR-containing sequences.
It is therefore difficult to conclude about the percentage
of genes harbouring SSR motifs. This is apparent from
several studies: (i) in Oryza sativa 40.4% [35] and 50%
[36] of EST-SSRs were detected using different software
and criteria; (ii) Kumpatla and Mukhopadhyay [37] analysed 1.5 million ESTs derived from 55 dicotyledonous
species and found that 2.6 to 16.8% of ESTs contained
at least one SSR; and (iii) because the level of polymorphism is positively correlated with the length of the
repeats region (see next paragraph), some authors have
chosen to use more stringent criteria (i.e. increase the
minimum number of repeat units in the detection
phase) to increase the probability to find polymorphic
SSR markers.
The availability of several genome sequences in
angiosperms makes it possible to more accurately estimate the proportion of gene models harbouring SSRs in
transcribed and UTR regions. In poplar for example,
about 6,000 SSRs were found in coding regions and
UTRs [38]. Therefore, taking into account the 45,000
putative protein-coding genes [39], 13.4% of the genes
would present a SSR. In Arabidopsis thaliana, 44% of
the 27,158 putative genes contain one or more SSRs
[40], but this figure also includes non transcribed
regions.
In oak we found that 18.6% of the unigenes presented at least one SSR motif. In two other Fagaceae
species, Quercus mongolica [25] and Castanopsis sieboldii [26] and it was found that 11.8% and 12.8% of
the putative unigenes presented microsatellite motifs
(from di- to tetra-nucleotide repeats). Taking into
account only di-, tri- and tetra-nucleotide repeats,
these figures are very similar to our finding (13.4%),
although the detection parameters were different (9 for
di-, 6 for tri-, 5 for tetra-nucleotides). Also in terms of
the abundance of motif types, our study agrees to that
of Ueno et al. [25,26] and other studies performed in
dicotyledonous species (reviewed by Kumpatla and
Mukhopadhyay [37]), i.e. AG and AAG were the most
abundant di- and trimeric SSRs, respectively. The

Durand et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:570
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/570

extremely low number of SSR motifs containing C and
G (2 CGs out of 1,713 dimeric SSRs and 103 CCGs
out of 2,212 trimeric SSRs) could be attributed to the
composition of dicot genes being less rich in G+C
compared to monocots due to codon usage bias [41]
and to the intrinsic negative correlation between GC
content and slippage rate [42].
As expected, the most frequent SSR class corresponded to trinucleotides (42%). This suggests that
many of the detected EST-SSRs are in protein-coding
regions because changes in trinucleotide repeat number
will not cause frame shifts unlike changes in other types
of motifs [43]. Indeed, the analysis of the distribution of
the EST-SSRs clearly showed that this type of SSR was
frequently found (ranging from 27.5% to 31.3% based on
FrameDP or ESTscan analysis, respectively) in coding
regions in contrast to other SSRs. As for dimeric SSRs,
the second most abundant type, our results confirm
what has been obtained in other studies, i.e. they were
mostly located in non-coding regions, despite a noticeable difference obtained between FrameDP (14.6%) and
ESTscan (21.5%). Overall, it should also be noticed that
most of the EST-SSRs found in non-coding region were
located in the 5’ UTR (ranging from 53.8% to 67.3%
based on FrameDP or ESTscan analysis, respectively).
Higher density of SSR in the 5’ UTR was also found in
rice [44]. This result could be attributed to either a
technical bias (ESTs being mainly generated from their
5’-ends) or a biological feature of plant genes as discussed by Grover et al. [44] and Fujimori et al. [45].
These authors found that rice and Arabidopsis genes
presented a higher rate of SSRs in the 5’ flanking
regions of the genes and interpreted this finding as a
regulatory role in gene expression.
To further explore the accuracy of FrameDP and ESTscan results, we carried out a complementary analysis using
poplar full length cDNAs for which structural annotations
were available [46]. The result of this analysis is provided
as supplemental data (additional file 7 - figure S1). By
comparing the SSR location based on true structural annotations it was clearly shown that ESTscan performed
better than FrameDP, the later over-estimating the presence of dinucleotide motifs in coding regions as was
found with the oak data. In agreement with the data
reported in rice and Arabidopsis, it was also found that
SSRs were more frequent in the 5’UTR of poplar genes
(additional file 7 - figure S1).
A total of 748 primer pairs were designed and tested
on a set of 4 genotypes, among which 568 (75.8%)
yielded amplicons. The failure for 24.2% of the primers
to generate an amplicon can be explained: i/ by the presence of large intronic regions preventing genomic DNA
to be amplified, ii/ the presence of SNPs/INDEL variation in the priming site of the tested genotypes,

Page 8 of 13

preventing the hybridization between the primers and
the target DNA, iii/ by the fact that a single PCR program was used without further optimisation, iv/ because
the M13 tail (that was added to each forward primer)
may interfer with appropriate PCR amplification [47],
and v/ because primers could have been designed for
chimeric unigene elements. A large proportion (285 out
of 568, i.e. 50%) of the successful primer pairs were
either monomorphic (163 EST-SSRs) or produced multibanding patterns or yielded faint amplification (122
EST-SSRs), thereby preventing the development of single copy SSRs. This study reveals that polymorphic SSRs
(283 loci) tended to have a higher number of repeats
(based on the EST data), ie. 10.58 for di, 7.27 for triand 3.4 for hexa-SSRs, compared to monomorphic ones
(163 loci), i.e. 9.80 for di-, 6.29 for tri-, and 3.20 for
hexa-SSRs. The effect of repeat number and motif on
the polymorphism was surveyed using logistic regression
model by the R software v. 2.6.2 (R Development Core
Team 2008), and the effect of repeat number was highly
significant (estimate of correlation coefficient for repeat
number = 0.237 and P < 0.001). This result agrees with
the significant positive correlation that was found
between SSR length and polymorphism rate in plants
and animals [48].
In oak, polymorphic markers were not evenly distributed among repeat classes, amounted to 58.7%, 44.3%
and 36% for di- tri- and hexa- repeats, respectively.
These figures confirm the higher level of polymorphism
of dinucleotide repeats among plants [49-51]. The lower
level of polymorphism for tri- and hexa- SSRs is mainly
related to their location in translated sequences compared to dimeric SSRs that were preferentially distributed in UTRs. These observations suggest that natural
selection limit both the number and polymorphism rate
of SSRs in translated regions of the genes. Moreover, a
closer examination among perfect di-and tri- oak SSRs
showed that the level of polymorphism (Figure 2)
depended on the type of motif. In particular, SSR markers with dinucleotide AC were the most polymorphic
loci. These considerations should be taken into account
for the development of additional polymorphic SSRs in
oak that are conserved among the Fagaceae species,
comparative genomics being our ultimate goal. In that
respect, we showed that oak dinucleotide EST-SSRs
were highly transferable to European chestnut.
Bin mapping

Linkage mapping is a time consuming process that
requires large size recombinant populations (from which
progenies are randomly chosen) to locate polymorphic
markers onto a genetic map. Other methods that do not
rely on meiotic recombination have also been developed
to assign any genes to chromosomal locations, such as

Durand et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:570
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/570

the use of aneuploid and deletion stocks in polyploids or
radiation hybrid panels. One important advantage of
these methods is that any sequence of interest is readily
placed on a radiation hybrid or deletion map. In contrast, only polymorphic markers can be mapped on a
genetic map. However, such approaches have been limited to a handful of plant species, including wheat
[52,53]. Alternatively, a computational method was
developed [4] to optimize the construction of highdensity linkage maps using a reduced sample of selected
offsprings presenting complementary recombinational
events throughout the genome. A prerequisite to such
selective/bin mapping approach is the availability of a
high-confidence framework map. The first bin mapping
approach was recently implemented in peach [5]. Using
only 6 F2 progenies, their F1 hybrid parent and one of
the grand-parental lines, these authors successfully
assigned 264 SSRs to 67 bins of the peach map. The bin
mapping strategy was also used in melon (121 SSRs/14
plants [6]; 200 SNP-based markers/14 plants [54]), apple
(31 SSRs/14 plants [8]) and strawberry (103 SSRs/8
plants [7]).
A bin mapping approach was developed for the first
time in a forest tree species to increase the density of
SSR markers in the oak linkage map and provide orthologous anchor markers for comparative mapping within
the Fagaceae. The selection of the bin set combined the
use of Mappop software and visual inspection of the
data. It resulted in the selection of 14 plants, which was
considered as a suitable size, as a set of 16 samples (14
F1s and both parents) fits in standard 96-well PCR
plates. With this subset, 44 (for the female map) and 37
(for the male map) bins were obtained. As expected
based on the number of different genotypic points
between adjacent bins, about half of the markers presented a genotype that was compatible with a putative
bin between two contiguous bins. To investigate the
accuracy of the bin mapping approach, a large number
of EST-SSRs was genotyped on an extended set of genotypes (46 or 92 F1s). Most markers assigned to bins or
putative bins were placed in the expected position, validating the bin mapping strategy for oak, despite the low
number of bins compared to similar studies [5,6]. At
this stage, it is difficult to propose a general guideline
for further bin mapping studies, but some general
recommendations can be made: i/ Number of individuals to be included in the bin set: it largely depends on
the population and marker types. For instance, there are
more genotypic informations in F2s as compared to F1s
for codominant markers (3 vs. 2 genotypic classes,
respectively). Therefore, less individuals will be needed
to define the bins with F2 genotypes. It also depends on
technical constraints, 14 individuals emerging as a
magic number in the few bin mapping studies published

Page 9 of 13

so far in plants, since 16 samples, corresponding to 14
offsprings and two parental lines, fits well in a single
raw of a 384-well microtiter plate!, ii/ Number of bins:
it obviously depends on the number of linkage groups
and on the number of individuals included in the bin
set (i.e. the more individuals, the more number of bins).

Conclusion
In the present study we used an EST catalog produced
for Quercus petraea and Q. robur, to mine and develop
EST-derived SSRs. We observed a relatively high abundance of single sequence repeats in the oak transcriptome, 18.6% of the unigene elements harboring at least
one SSR. Despite being less polymorphic than gSSRs,
their many advantages make them markers of choice for
genetic analyses. In particular, these functional markers
directly sample variations in genes, which enhance their
value for analyzing the genetic basis of forest tree adaptation through the use of non neutral, so called “functional”
markers in genetic diversity analysis, QTL and association mapping studies as well as comparative genomics.
The present study contributed 283 gene-derived
microsatellite markers, 255 of which were efficiently
assigned to a bin position using 14 informative individuals. The development and distribution of this reference set of highly recombinant genotypes to the
“European oak mapping community” has been instrumental for the development and mapping of this new
set of high quality markers that also proved to be useful
in a related species (chestnut).
Methods
Plant material and DNA extraction

The bin set and the verification panel were selected
from the Quercus robur full-sib family (3PxA4)
described by Saintagne et al. [12] The population that
was used to compare the level of polymorphism between
genomic SSRs and EST-SSRs is described by Alberto
et al. [27]. DNA was extracted from leaves using
DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
EST-SSRs detection

SSR motifs (5, 4, 3, 3, and 3 repeats at least for di-, tri-,
tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotides, respectively) were
searched within the first version of the oak unigene set
established from the assembly of 103,000 ESTs (available
at EMBL). These ESTs were derived from about 20
cDNA libraries constructed from mRNA extracted from
4 tissues (bud, leaf, xylem and root) collected on Q.
robur and Q. petreae genotypes. The main objective to
generate such a large number of ESTs was to catalogue
as many as possible non-redundant genes (unigene set)
of oak. These ESTs were assembled to avoid redundancy
in SSR detection using the transcript reconstruction

Durand et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:570

system stackPACK™ [55] from the SAMBI Institute. This
pipeline uses the following programs: Cross_Match [56]
to clean up the sequences, d2_cluster [57] to perform a
loose first stage clustering, PHRAP [58] to assemble
these clusters into contigs and finally CRAW [59] to
generate the longest consensi.
SSRs motifs were searched using mreps (v. 2.5) [23].
In a comparative study in Pinus pinaster (G. Le Provost,
unpublished) mreps was found to be more stringent
compared to SSRIT [60] and Sputnik v1.22 (http://abajian.net/sputnik/). Once detected, SSRs located 35
nucleotides from either end of each unigene element
were discarded to keep enough sequence information
for primer design. In addition, those SSRs that were
immediately adjacent to each other (separated by less
than 30 nucleotides) were merged into a single SSR.
The output of mreps was converted into a standard csv
file corresponding to the SSR database structure put in
place in the frame of the Evoltree project. Specific information for each SSR included the unigene element ID
and the annotation, the repeat motif, its length and
position (additional file 3 - table S1, also available
through the Quercus portal (https://w3.pierroton.inra.
fr:8443/QuercusPortal/Home.jsf).
ESTscan [24] and FrameDP [61] were used to estimate
the location of a coding region within unigenes. By
combining the output from mreps, the location of ESTSSR (either coding or noncoding regions) was estimated.
Microsatellites, for which no results were returned by
each software or location was covered across both coding and non-coding regions, were discarded. Because
there are no annotated full-length genes available for
oak yet, we used Arabidopsis thaliana sequences as a
training set for the analysis performed by ESTScan. The
resulting matrix was used for peptide prediction of oak
unigenes. For the analysis using FrameDP, no specific
training set is required.
SSR genotyping

Primer pairs were designed for 748 unigene elements
(including 348 di-, 320 tri-, 2 tetra-, 1 penta-, 77 hexanucleotides) using Primer3 [62]. A M13 tail (TGT AAA
ACG ACG GCC AGT) [63] was added to the 5’-end of
the forward primer to facilitate exchange of primers
between the partners of the network that used different
capillary electrophoresis systems: i.e. ABI3730 (Applied
Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA), Licor 4300 (Licor, Lincoln, NB, USA), Megabace (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). PCR reactions were performed in a
final volume of 10 μL containing: 1× PCR-buffer [10
mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM KCl 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , pH 8.3 at
25°C] (BioLabs, Ipswich, England), 100 μM of dNTPs,
0.045 μM of forward primers, 0.165 μM of reverse primer (5 μM), 0.165 μM of M13 primer, 0.25 U of Taq

polymerase (BioLabs) and 6 ng of plant DNA. The
cycling conditions were as described by Shuelke et al
[60]: i.e., a first denaturation at 94°C during 4 minutes,
35 cycles at three temperatures, 94°C for 30 s, 56°C for
45 s, and 72°C for 45 s. Additionally 9 cycles were run
at 94°C for 30 s, 53°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 45 s and a
final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes and a cooling at
10°C. Data generated were analysed using the GeneScan
3.7 and Genotyper 3.7 softwares for ABI, 4300 DNA
analyser software for Licor and Fragment Analyser version 1.2 for MegaBace sequencing machine.
Nomenclature of the markers

EST-SSR marker ID consisted of: three letters to identify
the lab where they were developed i.e, PIE for those
designed in Pierroton (INRA, France) followed by a
serial number. Genomic markers were designated
according to the restriction enzymes and the primer
combination used, and their amplification size. RAPD
markers were named as follows: the letter and the first
digit refers to the identification of the OPERON primers
[64] and the last digits correspond to the molecular
weight of the polymorphic bands.
Bin mapping strategy

A total of 748 primer-pairs were tested for amplification
and polymorphism on both parental trees and two progenies. Given the relatively high number of putative
markers, a bin mapping approach was followed (summarized in additional file 8 - figure S1) with the main
objective of minimizing the number of trees to be genotyped, while assigning the markers to their most probable map location. From the initial dataset (278 F1s ×
953 markers) a double screen was first applied, consisting of selecting individuals with < 50% missing data and
markers with a LOD support for local ordering ≥3 (i.e.
framework markers according to Saintagne et al. [12]),
resulting in a total of 66 individuals and 128 testcross
(1:1 segregation) and intercross (1:1:1:1 segregation
recoded as 1:1 in each parent) markers. Male and female
framework maps were then generated under the twoway pseudo-testcross mapping strategy [65] using the
regression mapping algorithm of Joinmap v4.0 [30].
These two datasets were used to select a smaller number of highly recombinant progenies as follows: i/ a first
set of 46 plants was selected based on maximizing the
number of breakpoints along the 24 linkage groups (12
in the male and 12 in the female maps), using the Mappop software [4,66], and ii/ a final subset of 14 F1s (the
bin set: #109, #110, #116, #121, #127, #128, #131, #151,
#162, #165, #166, #172, #176, #196) was retained by
visual inspection, combining three additional criteria: i)
selection of individuals with missing data < 10% and
presenting a minimum of duplicated bins; ii)

Durand et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:570
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/570

optimisation of both female and male map coverage
with the smallest bin size as possible, and iii) minimization of double crossing-over between adjacent framework markers. The bin set (and the parental lines) were
finally genotyped for all “mappable” markers segregating
in testcross (1:1 ratio), intercross (1:2:1) and outcross
(1:1:1:1 ratio) configurations. The EST-SSRs were
assigned to their most probable bin by matching their
genotypic profile to that of the framework markers. Bins
were coded by a two-digit number, the first corresponding to the linkage group ID (1 to 12) and the second to
their numerical order.
Validation of bin assignment

To further test the efficiency of the bin mapping
approach, we compared the bin location (obtained as
described above) with the map location of SSRs. The
map position was estimated on an extended set of genotypes using the two-point test for linkage implemented in
Joinmap. An a priori validation was first carried out
based on 19 genomic SSRs (indicated in blue in Figure 2)
that were already genotyped and mapped by Barreneche
et al. [20]. An a posteriori validation was also performed
for 146 and 65 non-overlapping EST-SSRs that were genotyped on 46 and 92 progenies, respectively. Markers
presenting a LOD score for linkage > 2 (for 46 F1s) or 3
(for 92 F1s) were classified into three categories: class A
for markers for which the nearest framework marker
(FM) was included in the bin, class B for markers for
which the nearest FM was found in an adjacent bin, and
class C for markers for which the nearest FM was located
in a more distant bin or else in another linkage group.
Markers presenting a LOD score for linkage below these
thresholds were classified as D marker.
Genetic diversity analysis

Genetic diversity statistics (gene diversity He [67]) and
allelic richness (A) were estimated for 16 genomic and 16
EST-derived SSRs using the program Fstat 2.9.3.2 [68].
Allelic richness (A) was calculated using the rarefaction
method developed by El Mousadik and Petit [28].
