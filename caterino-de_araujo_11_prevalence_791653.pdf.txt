From 15th International Conference on Human Retroviruses: HTLV and Related Viruses
Leuven and Gembloux, Belgium. 5-8 June 2011
Background
In the last decades, an outbreak of HIV/AIDS occurred
in Mozambique (MZ), and since HIV and HTLV share
the same routes of virus transmission/acquisition, we
decided to estimate the actual prevalence of such
retroviruses.
Materials and methods
Blood samples were collected from 208, 226 and 318
individuals from Northern, Central and Southern MZ,
respectively, of all socioeconomic and demographic
strata, attending Public Health Centers. Sera were
assessed for HIV-1/2- and HTLV-1/2–specific antibodies by enzyme immunoassays and confirmed by Western blot. HTLV-1/2-seropositive blood samples were
submitted for PCR (LTR, env, and pol) and real-time
PCR (pol) assays, and sequenced.
Results
An overall HTLV-1/2 prevalence of 2.3% was observed,
and increased with age. Regional variation in the prevalence of HIV and HTLV-1/2 was observed; 32.2%, 65.5%
and 44% of individuals tested HIV-positive in Northern,
Central and Southern MZ, respectively, and 2.4%, 3.9%
and 0.9% tested HTLV-1-positive in the same regions.
No association between HTLV-1 infection and sociodemographic variables or HIV status was detected. One
woman aged 54 years, born in Northern MZ, HIV-negative, who complaints of rheumatic pain, presented high
HTLV-1 proviral load, and phylogenetic analysis of env

and LTR sequences clustered HTLV-1-isolate into Cosmopolitan subtype, transcontinental subgroup A (GenBank Accession numbers HM770441 and JF271853).

Discussion and conclusions
These data suggest different risk factors and epidemiologic correlates of HIV and HTLV-1 transmission in MZ.
HTLV-1 is endemic in this country, and arthritis was
associated with HTLV-1 infection in one patient.
