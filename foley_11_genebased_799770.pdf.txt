Abstract
Background: As yet, few genomic resources have been developed in crustaceans. This lack is particularly evident
in Copepoda, given the extraordinary numerical abundance, and taxonomic and ecological diversity of this group.
Tigriopus californicus is ideally suited to serve as a genetic model copepod and has been the subject of extensive
work in environmental stress and reproductive isolation. Accordingly, we set out to develop a broadly-useful panel
of genetic markers and to construct a linkage map dense enough for quantitative trait locus detection in an
interval mapping framework for T. californicus–a first for copepods.
Results: One hundred and ninety Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were used to genotype our mapping
population of 250 F2 larvae. We were able to construct a linkage map with an average intermarker distance of 1.8
cM, and a maximum intermarker distance of 10.3 cM. All markers were assembled into linkage groups, and the 12
linkage groups corresponded to the 12 known chromosomes of T. californicus. We estimate a total genome size of
401.0 cM, and a total coverage of 73.7%. Seventy five percent of the mapped markers were detected in 9
additional populations of T. californicus. Of available model arthropod genomes, we were able to show more
colocalized pairs of homologues between T. californicus and the honeybee Apis mellifera, than expected by chance,
suggesting preserved macrosynteny between Hymenoptera and Copepoda.
Conclusions: Our study provides an abundance of linked markers spanning all chromosomes. Many of these
markers are also found in multiple populations of T. californicus, and in two other species in the genus. The
genomic resource we have developed will enable mapping throughout the geographical range of this species and
in closely related species. This linkage map will facilitate genome sequencing, mapping and assembly in an
ecologically and taxonomically interesting group for which genomic resources are currently under development.

Background
Copepods are among the most abundant metazoans on
the planet and include more than 11,500 described species [1]. They are ecologically important, spanning a
broad range of marine, freshwater and moist terrestrial
habitats and serving as major players in global energy
transfer, including the largest portion of carbon turnover
in the oceanic food web [2]. They are also of economic
interest, serving as both prey and parasites of valuable
fishery species. Despite their ecological and economic
importance, there are few genetic resources developed

for copepods, and existing models are likely to be of
limited use in this group.
The overwhelming majority of arthropod model systems are insects. Additionally, Daphnia pulex (a branchiopod crustacean) has recently been sequenced [3].
However, neither insects nor Daphnia are phylogenetically close to copepods. While the precise topology of
the arthropod phylogeny is currently debated, the split
between Insecta, Copepoda and Branchiopoda is deep in
the Cambrian. Shrimp (decapod crustaceans) are somewhat more closely related to copepods and have been
the subject of genetic work [e.g. 4, 5] due to their economic importance in the seafood market. However, like
other decapods, shrimp have high rates of genomic
duplication, complicating genomic analyses and rendering them less useful as models [6-8].

Tigriopus californicus is an increasingly attractive
genetic model copepod and model crustacean. It has a
history as an experimental system for environmental
stress, ecotoxicology and speciation [9-12], is easily cultured in the lab, and has an experimentally tractable life
cycle. It also has one of the smaller known crustacean
genomes–a full order of magnitude smaller than the
tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon [5].
T. californicus has an extensive range along the west
coast of North America, from Alaska to Baja California.
It is a supralittoral marine harpacticoid copepod, inhabiting splash pools of the rocky shore. It has extremely
limited gene flow, with strong genetic differentiation
between even geographically close populations [13,14].
Populations from Santa Cruz and San Diego, California
are the focus of concerted efforts for the development
of genetic resources by several labs. The transcriptomes
of the two populations have recently been published
[10]. A linkage map comprising 8 microsatellite markers
and 45 nuclear SNPs has also recently been constructed
[15] with a corrected map length of 484.8 cM, where
the 11 linkage groups and one unlinked marker apparently corresponded to the 12 chromosomes of T. californicus [16].
A linkage map is a reference point for understanding
the genetic basis of phenotypic variation. It is a valuable
tool for genome-wide scans of genetic variation, for dissection of QTL (quantitative trait loci) and for the
assembly of a physical map. By focusing on developing
gene-based markers, our map will facilitate comparative
studies using orthologous genes.
We here develop a linkage map between the Santa
Cruz and San Diego populations, comprising 190 SNP
markers. We validate these markers in 9 additional, geographically distinct populations of T. californicus. We
also screen the markers in two commonly studied congeners with similar ecology: T. japonicus, which is distributed around the Asian Pacific rim, and T.
brevicornis, which is distributed from Portugal to Nova
Scotia around the Northern Atlantic. Many of the markers we develop are also reliably detectable in these two
congeners, and will be broadly useful as a community
resource for genetic mapping in these species. The
development of this linkage map is an essential prelude
to the more detailed genomic characterization of a
model copepod.

Methods
SNP development

The majority of SNPs were identified from 454 cDNA
sequence data for the Santa Cruz (SC, 36°57’N, 122°
03’W) and San Diego (SD, 32°45’N, 117°15’W) T. californicus populations [10]. Sequences were aligned using the
gsAssembler (Roche) and visualized in Consed [17].

Page 2 of 8

Diagnostic SC/SD fixed SNPs were chosen using the following criteria: contig > 200bp, minimum of 2 reads for
each population, significant sequence alignment to
metazoan sequence (BLAST2GO [18]) with an E-value
≤ 10 -3 and sufficient conserved flanking regions for
priming sites. Another subset of potential SNPs were
identified from known gene sequences obtained from
Genbank or from unpublished data (R. Burton). For
each of the markers with a positive genetic identification, the name of the marker is consistent with the
putative-orthologue name, taken as the most-significant
alignment using tBlastx at [19]. The one exception is
TFAM, where the most significant alignment is to a predicted gene product in Tribolium castaneum of the general class of transcription factors which includes TFAM.
Subsequent best alignments are to TFAM orthologues
in a number of species.
Primers and extension sequences for iPlex high
throughput genotyping were developed from this dataset
by Jeffrey Conroy at the Genomic Shared Resources, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, using the iPlex
Gold software (Sequenom, San Diego CA). Primer and
extension sequences are shown in Additional File 1. 201
SNP assays were designed for multiplexing in a total of 7
wells, with a maximum of 30 assays in each well.
Sequences ranged from 15-29bp. Within each well, the
minimum molecular weight of a sequence was 4567 daltons, and the maximum weight was 8949.9 daltons
(Additional File 1). The minimum difference between
any two products was 16 daltons. Sequences were scored
for molecular weight in a Sequenom mass spectrometer,
and SNP identity determined by molecular weight.
SNPs were validated for 5 adult males and 5 adult
females from each of the SC and SD lines, and found to
be fixed for alternate alleles in each population, with
heterozygotes confirmed in 20 F 1 hybrids. SNPs were
also tested in 9 additional populations of T. californicus
(Table 1), and a single population each of T. brevicornis
and T. japonicus (average n = 5). A panel of 46 previously utilized SNPs [15] was also included, including 2
mitochondrial markers to test for contamination.
DNA extraction

Nauplii (larvae) for genotyping were hatched from latestage egg sacs isolated in single drops of seawater in a
petri plate. The petri plate was flooded with lysis buffer
(10 mM Tris pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 0.5% Tween 20).
Individual nauplii were pipetted in 2-5 μl of buffer to
200 μl PCR tubes containing 10 μl of buffer with 200
μg/ml Proteinase K (final concentration). Tubes were
incubated at 65°C for 1 hr followed by 100°C for 15 min
and then frozen at -80°C. DNA extraction of adult individuals followed a similar procedure except that individuals were briefly rinsed in diH2O and blotted dry on

before being frozen at -80°C. Adult samples were subsequently extracted in 50 μl lysis buffer with 200 μl/ml
Proteinase K (final concentration). 20 μl of each sample
was dried at 60°C for 4 hours before being sent to the
Roswell Park Cancer Institute for genotyping, and the
remaining 30 μl was retained at -80°C for future work.
F2 mapping population

Upon maturation, males of T. californicus perform mate
guarding–holding an immature female until she is
mature, then mating with her and releasing her. Observing clasped dyads facilitates sexing of immature individuals, and allows the ready collection of virgins. Females
are known to mate only a single time in their life, and
use stored sperm to fertilize multiple clutches of eggs
[20]. Inbred–isofemale–lines are therefore established by
isolating a single fertilized female and allowing offspring,
including those from overlapping generations, to mate
freely.
Isofemale lines were established from SC and SD
populations and were maintained in the laboratory for
2.5 years. With a minimum generation time of 23 days,
at 20°C, this corresponds to approximately 39 generations of culture. All laboratory stocks were reared in a
standard medium of thrice-filtered (40 μm nitex filters)
seawater with added growth medium (0.1 g of spirulina
and 0.1 g of ground Tetramin per litre of seawater).
Crosses between SD females and SC males were conducted in 250 ml beakers containing 200 ml of growth
medium. Six replicate crosses consisted each of 50

males and 50 females. Males were discarded after 1
week. Females were removed after 2 weeks, when copepodids (juveniles) became visible. When clasping pairs
of F 1 offspring were observed, the males and females
were separated and then united with a partner descending from a different beaker to avoid potential full sibling
mating (see Additional File 2). Single pairs comprising
an F 1 female and an F 1 male were placed in separate
petri plates containing 12 ml of culture medium. Males
were removed when an egg sac was observed, and
females moved to fresh plates as each successive clutch
hatched. 250 first instar nauplii were collected for genotyping. In previous experiments, little segregation distortion has been observed in early stage nauplii [15].
Additional samples for genotyping

In addition to the F2 hybrids we also genotyped 19 nonrecombinant backcross hybrid adults [(SD female × SC
male) F 1 female × SD male; see Additional File 2].
Because T. californicus females do not undergo recombination [16,21] this non-recombinant cross allows confirmation that linkage groups identified from the F 2
mapping population are on different chromosomes.
Lastly, between 5 and 10 adult individuals from 9 other
populations of T. californicus, as well as T. brevicornis
and T. japonicus were collected for genotyping.
Mapping

The use of previously mapped SNPs [15] and cytochrome-c [22] enabled us to maintain chromosomal
identity from previous work. Chromosomes 1, 2, 5, 7, 8,

Foley et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:568
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/568

9, 10, 11 and 12 were anchored to the linkage groups of
Harrison and Edmands [23] and Pritchard et al. [15]
(where chromosome 12 corresponds with linkage group
D). Our current chromosomes 3, 4 and 6 correspond to
the linkage groups of A, B, and C respectively of Pritchard et al. [15] and we were not able to anchor them to
Harrison and Edmands [23].
The linkage map was constructed using the JoinMap
3.0 software package [24]. The Kosambi mapping function was used, with an LOD threshold of 1.0, a recombination threshold of 0.4, and default values for all other
settings. Correct assignment of markers to chromosomes was confirmed using the non-recombinant backcross genotypes. Several markers exhibited substantial
apparent segregation distortion, departing significantly
from Hardy Weinberg expectation (c2 >14, p < 0.001, df
= 1). We did not exclude these a priori from the analysis. Following construction of the map, we examined the
proposed haplotypes and found that, for the 5 most distorted markers we would have to posit recombination in
females at levels above 25% between the distorted markers and their nearest neighbors to explain the marker
states. As recombination in females is known to not
occur at levels >1% [16,21], we excluded these 5 markers
from the analysis. We were unable to determine the
source of this apparent genotyping error, but one possibility is cryptic, previously unidentified polymorphism.
Predicted effect of SNPS on protein sequence

Nucleotides that are under lower selective constraint
might be expected to have higher substitution rates, and
thus may be expected to have more alleles across populations. For all SNPs, we used the probable coding
sequences of Barreto et al. [10] to determine whether
the SNP was in a translated region of the transcript, and
if so, whether or not the SNPs were synonymous. SNP
positions and translations were calculated by matching
the Sequenom extension sequences against the transcripts of Baretto et al [10] using the Bioperl (v1.6.1)
module of Perl (v 5.12.2).
Synteny with model species

We attempted to find signs of macrosynteny with several assembled arthropod genomes–the insects Apis
mellifera [25], assembly 4.5, with a 1n = 16; D. melanogaster [26] assembly 4.3, with 1n = 5 (commonly the
major chromosomal arms are treated as independent
linkage groups); and Tribolium castaneum [27] assembly
3.0 with a 1n = 12; and the recently sequenced Branchiopod crustacean, Daphnia pulex [3] beta 3 release
with a 1n = 12. Of these, the insect genomes were the
most fully assembled, and we were able to disregard any
unanchored scaffolds. In D. pulex, there were far more
unanchored scaffolds–3804–and we did not exclude any

Page 4 of 8

(although the majority of the genome is assembled in
the first 50 scaffolds and the majority of our Blast alignments were expected to localize on these).
To identify homologs, we performed sequence alignment searches using tBlastx of the flanking sequence for
each of our mapped markers (cDNA contigs for new
markers and ESTs for markers from Pritchard et al. [15])
against each reference draft genome assembly, with a
threshold of E-value ≤ 10-3 and the default settings. Several sequences had multiple alignments exceeding this
threshold, and in these cases we considered only the
most significant sequence alignment. The A. mellifera
amino acid sequences were obtained from[28]. The T.
castaneum amino acid sequences were obtained from
[29], and the chromosomal location of the most significant alignments for both the A. mellifera and T. castaneum genomes were obtained by querying the Batch
Entrez database at [19] with the gi numbers. The D. melanogaster v. 4.3 sequences were obtained from Flybase
[30]. The D. pulex amino acid sequences were obtained
from [31] and the scaffold identity of these sequences
subsequently obtained by tBlastn to the genomic scaffold
obtained at the same site. Where a pair of putative homologs colocalized to a single linkage group in both species,
we scored it as a single potential syntenic unit. Where
three markers colocalized in this way, we scored 2 alignments (in no case did more than 3 homologs colocalize
in both species). We summed all potential syntenic units
for each species (Table 2). Significance was determined
by randomly permuting the homolog locations relative to
the T. californicus chromosomal map positions 1000
times in R [32], and counting the number of estimated
syntenic units each time.

Results
SNP development

Of the total of 245 nuclear SNPs we assayed, 190 SNPs
were found to be reliable in our genotyping pools,
including 38 of the previously developed markers [15].
Only these 190 SNP markers are reported here (Additional File 1). In nauplii, none of these markers were
found to be significantly distorted after Bonferroni correction. Primers and extension sequences were found to
be widely conserved within populations of T. californicus, as well as sister species T. brevicornis and T. japonicus. Many of the SNPs identified in the SC-SD
comparison were polymorphic within other populations
(Table 1, diagonal, bold; Additional File 1). The number
of fixed differences between populations, as well as segregating polymorphisms within populations, together
represent the potential pool of markers for mapping in
T. californicus. The number of potential markers for use
in mapping differences between population pairs
appears in the above-diagonal of Table 1.

The number of linkage groups of the draft reference genomes of each species are shown, with the number of identified homologues between T. californicus and
each of the reference genomes, and the number of homologue pairs which colocalize to a linkage group in both T. californicus and the reference. The maximum
(threshold) number of colocalized pairs we would expect to see by chance, and the significance of the observed number of colocalized pairs were determined by
permutation.

Mapping

The final assembly consisted of 12 linkage groups, corresponding to the known 12 chromosomes of T. californicus (Figure 1). These 12 linkage groups were
confirmed by results from the non-recombinant backcross. The average intermarker distance was 1.81 cM,
and the maximum distance between adjacent markers
was 10.3 cM. The sum of the distances between the
markers gives an estimated linkage map length of
323.5 cM long. Applying the suggested correction
method [number 4 in 33] to estimate total map length,
where Li is map length of a given chromosome i, and
m i is the number of markers for that linkage group,

Figure 1 linkage map of Tigriopus californicus, in centimorgans.

Ltot = i ( Li+2 ) × (m + 1)/(m − 1) = 401.0 cM. We estimated total coverage following [34]. Given total marker number n = 190, and average intermarker distance
d = 1.81 cM, the proportion coverage
c = 1 − e−2dn/Ltot = 0.737. The recombination rate, given
the estimated haploid genome size of 244.5Mb [35,36],
corresponds approximately 1.6 cM/Mbp. The sizes of
the linkage groups ranged from 19 to 32 cM.
Predicted effect of SNPs on protein sequence

Of the 190 SNPs used to construct the linkage map, 125
(66%) are predicted to be translated, and of these 125,
101 (79.5%) are synonymous substitutions. Of these 101

loci, there are other synonymous substitutions possible
at 80 loci (Additional File 1).
Synteny with model species

Orthologues to 153 of the 190 T. californicus sequences
were detected in the reference genomes (Additional File
3). The greatest number of detected orthologues (144)
was with reference to the D. melanogaster genome, and
the lowest (72) was with D. pulex. There was evidence
of macrosynteny between T. californicus and the A. mellifera genome. Nine pairs of orthologous genes were
found to colocalize on chromosomes in both species,
above the maximum of 7 pairs we might expect to find
colocalizing by chance. After applying a Bonferroni correction for 4 tests, for each of the reference genomes,
the confidence interval for the number of syntenic units
shared between the two species is still below the p =
0.0125 threshold for significance as determined by permutation (Table 2, Table 3).

Discussion
We successfully mapped the T. californicus nuclear genome, using 38 previously described SNPs, and 152 novel
SNPs, to a total of 190 markers. This corresponds to an
average of 1 marker every 1.29 Mbp, and an average
intermarker distance of 1.8 cM. All markers were
assigned to linkage groups, and the maximum intermarker distance was 10.3 cM. We will thus be able to use
these markers to impute genotypes in interval mapping
with 95% accuracy or better for all positions in the genome. The 12 linkage groups obtained corresponded to
the 12 known chromosomes of T. californicus, and most
were anchored to linkage groups previously identified
with microsatellite and Amplified Fragment Length
Polymorphism (AFLP) markers [23]. The total corrected
map length of 401.0 cM was somewhat lower than the
estimated map length of Pritchard et al. [15], and the
estimated total coverage of 73.7% was also somewhat
lower than their 75.2% coverage, but this difference in

estimates is unsurprising given the much deeper coverage we have achieved in the current study.
All crosses between populations of T. californicus
from Southern California to British Columbia produce
fertile F1 progeny [37]. Pairs of populations, however,
exhibit increasing F 2 hybrid breakdown by distance–
populations as close as 100 km can have a reduction in
fitness of 50% in the F2 relative to the parental populations [13,37]. We found no evidence of segregation distortion in the nauplii of our mapping population,
however. This is consistent with previous studies which
found generally undistorted allele frequencies in the
early larval stage, while adults had allele frequencies
which strongly departed from expected frequencies
[15,38].
Primer sequences used for polymerase chain reaction
DNA amplifications were largely conserved between
populations. In only one population (PA) did more than
5 primer sets fail to amplify a product, and we found
many SNPs segregating within and between populations.
The elevated differentiation between PA and the Southern Californian populations was not unexpected, as Baja
populations of T. californicus have been found to be
very divergent in mitochondrial haplotype [13], and to
exhibit high rates of hybrid breakdown when crossed
with northern populations [39]. Many of our primers
also amplified products in the sister species T. japonicus
and T. brevicornis. The SNP markers we have characterized here, therefore will be generally useful for QTL
mapping across the entire geographic range of T. californicus. For all but a few population pairs, it will be possible to construct mapping lines and distinguish every
chromosome in a non-recombinant backcross design.
Additional SNPs may be found to segregate in these
populations, since they were only genotyped for the
known SD and SC SNPs (or SC, SD and a third population in the case of the SNPs from Pritchard et al. [15]).
Only 20 of the SNP markers were in coding regions at
twofold degenerate sites, suggesting as many as 89.5% of
the SNPs may be under relaxed selective constraint.
Populations will thus need to be characterized for alternate alleles for mapping purposes. The known level of
triallely of SNPs is very low in T. californicus, however.
V. Pritchard (pers. comm) found that between San
Diego, Santa Cruz and Punta Baja (Baja California),
levels of triallely are approximately 2% at SNP sites
across the genome. These 3 populations are deeply
divergent within T. californicus, suggesting that withinspecies at least, there will be few uncharacterized alleles.
Compared with the other arthropods, the recombination rate of T. californicus (1.6 cM/Mbp) is low
[reviewed in 39], but is more than sufficient for mapping in F 2 , backcross and other linkage mapping
approaches. It is similar to that of Diptera(mean = 1.03

cM/Mbp) and shrimp Penaeus monodon (mean = 1.01
cM/Mbp)[5], but it is approximately 21% the estimated
recombination rate of Daphnia pulex at 7.52 cM/Mbp
[40]. It is much lower than Hymenoptera (mean = 7.12
cM/Mbp), and somewhat lower than the more typical
arthropod recombination rate of Coleoptera (mean =
2.48 cM/Mbp) [41]. It is known that recombination
rates in groups with alternate life histories are under
selection–for instance, social vs. solitary Hymenoptera
have greatly elevated recombination rates. The relatively
high recombination rate of D. pulex compared to
shrimp and T. californicus is possibly due to its reproductive mode–many generations of parthenogenesis,
punctuated by episodic sex, may have consequences on
the evolution of recombination rate [42]. Another reason for the relatively low recombination rate might be
that recombination occurs only in males in T. californicus [16,21].
Additionally, perhaps surprisingly, there was some evidence of macrosynteny between A. mellifera and T. californicus, although there was no one-to-one
correspondence between chromosomes. No evidence of
synteny was found T. californicus and D. pulex or D.
melanogaster; however, this may be because these genomes have undergone higher rates of chromosomal rearrangements. It was reported that no evidence of synteny
was found between D. pulex and D. melanogaster either
[40]. In fact, Critescu et al. [40] suggest–based on the
rearrangement rate of Drosophila–that synteny should
only be apparent between crustaceans and insects at
scales smaller than 100 kb. It may be that Hymenoptera
and Copepoda have lower rates of large-scale chromosomal fission and fusion than Drosophila and the other
assayed arthropod lineages.

Conclusion
We have mapped the T. californicus genome to a level
of coverage that will enable common mapping techniques such as nonrecombinant backcross, and F 2 or
Recombinant Inbred Line mapping–greatly expanding
the possible scope of work in this species. The markers
and map developed will potentially be useful more
broadly in the genus Tigriopus. The phylogenetic position of T. californicus, its compact genome size, and its
tractability in the lab have all positioned it as an excellent model crustacean system. The continued development of genomic tools such as this linkage map will
enable future exciting work in this species.
