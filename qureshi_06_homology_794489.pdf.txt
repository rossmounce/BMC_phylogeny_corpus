Presence of anti-Tat immune responses in HIV infected
individual's correlates inversely with the progression of
disease. Thus, we focused on the phylogeny & immunogenicity of Indian subtype C tat gene. In this study full
length HIV-1 tat gene was amplified and sequenced. Based
on sequencing data HIV-1 Indian subtype Ctat gene consensus sequence was derived, mutated & codon optimized. This modified tat gene consensus was used to
construct tat DNA/MVA vaccine. Immunogenicity of tat
DNA/MVA vaccine was studied in mice and immune
responses were evaluated by IFNg ELISpot assay and
ELISA. Our tat study sequences depicted maximum homology with HIV-1 subtype C. DNA distances of tat study
sequences with consensus sequences of subtype M, C,
B&A were 8–10%, 4–6%, 19–21% & 11–18% respectively. Mice immunized with tat DNA construct alone
developed potent cross clade T cell & antibodyresponses.
Magnitude of these immune responses was increased 3
folds in mice immunized with tat DNA/MVA prime boost
regimen. Immunogenic regions of Indian subtype CTat
protein localize at amino acid (aa)1–20, aa 16–35, aa 31–
50, aa 67–86. Core region(aa 31–50) of Indian subtype
CTat protein was found to be immunodominant. In this
scenario HIV-1 Indiansubtype Ctat gene appears to be a
suitable candidate for future multigene HIV vaccine.
