Abstract
Background: Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is endemic in Pakistan and causes huge economic
losses. This work focus on the Landhi Dairy Colony (LDC), located in the suburbs of Karachi. LDC
is the largest Buffalo colony in the world, with more than 300,000 animals (around 95% buffaloes
and 5% cattle, as well as an unknown number of sheep and goats).
Each month from April 2006 to April 2007 we collected mouth-swabs from apparently healthy
buffaloes and cattle, applying a convenient sampling based on a two-stage random sampling scheme,
in conjunction with participatory information from each selected farm. Furthermore, we also
collected epithelium samples from animals with clinical disease, as well as mouth-swabs samples
from those farms. In addition, we analysed a total of 180 serum samples randomly collecting 30
samples each month at the local slaughterhouse, from October 2006 to March 2007.
Samples have been screened for FMDV by real-time RT-PCR and the partial or full 1D coding
region of selected isolates has been sequenced. Serum samples have been analysed by applying
serotype-specific antibody ELISA and non-structural proteins (NSP) antibody ELISA.
Results: FMDV infection prevalence at aggregate level shows an endemic occurrence of FMDV in
the colony, with peaks in August 2006, December 2006 and February 2007 to March 2007. A
significant association of prevalence peaks to the rainy seasons, which includes the coldest time of
the year and the muslimic Eid-festival, has been demonstrated.
Participatory information indicated that 88% of all questioned farmers vaccinate their animals.
Analysis of the serum samples showed high levels of antibodies for serotypes O, A, Asia 1 and C.
The median endpoint-titre for all tested serotypes, except serotype C, in VNT titration is at a
serum dilution of equal or above 1/100.
All 180 serum samples collected have been tested for antibodies against the non-structural proteins
and all but four have been found positive.

Out of the 106 swab-samples from apparently healthy and affected animals positive in real-time RTPCR, we sequenced the partial or full 1D coding region from 58 samples. In addition we sequenced
the full 1D coding region of 17 epithelium samples from animals with clinical signs of FMD. From
all sequenced samples, swabs and epithelium, 19 belong to the regional PanAsia II lineage of
serotype O and 56 to the A/Iran/2005 lineage of serotype A.
Conclusion: For an effective and realisable FMD control program in LDC, we suggest to introduce
a twice annually mass vaccination of all buffaloes and cattle in the colony. These mass vaccinations
should optimally take place shortly before the beginning of the two rainy periods, e.g. in June and
September. Those vaccinations should, in our opinion, be in addition to the already individually
performed vaccinations of single animals, as the latter usually targets only newly introduced animals.
This suggested combination of mass vaccination of all large ruminants with the already performed
individually vaccination should provide a continuous high level of herd immunity in the entire
colony.
Vaccines used for this purpose should contain the matching vaccine strains, i.e. as our results
indicate antigens for A/Iran/2005 and the regional type of serotype O (PanAsia II), but also antigens
of the, in this world region endemic, Asia 1 lineage should be included.
In the long term it will be important to control the vaccine use, so that subclinical FMD will be
avoided.

Background
Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious
and economically important disease caused by foot-andmouth disease virus (FMDV). Animals that can be affected
include cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, pigs and wild ruminants [1]. FMDV is a positive sense, single-stranded RNA
virus (genus Aphthovirus, family Picornaviridae) occurring
in seven serotypes, O, A, C, Asia 1, SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT
3, each with a wide spectrum of antigenic and epidemiological distinct subtypes. The wide diversity is considered
a consequence of the high mutation rate, quasi-species
dynamics and recombination [2,3].
FMD is endemic in Pakistan [4] and causes huge economic losses to commercial cattle and buffalo owners.
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations (FAO) there are no proper arrangements for providing vaccine to the farmers and the open
market is flooded with uncontrolled vaccine of doubtful
efficiency [5].
FMD is considered endemic with the serotypes O, A and
Asia 1 in both Pakistan [6] and the neighbouring countries of India, Afghanistan, Iran and China [7-9] and those
serotypes are a continued problem in Pakistan.
According to the OIE HandiSTATUS [10] Pakistan considers itself as having a seasonal, low-level, sporadic occurrence of FMD (Pakistan reported around 10–30 outbreaks
per year until year 2000 after which no information is
available). Animals are only vaccinated upon request and
the yearly number of vaccine doses used varies between
12,000 to 95,000 doses for cattle and 7,000 to 60,000 for

buffaloes in the years from 1997–2002 (no data available
after 2002) [10]. This amount of vaccine is likely in addition to an unknown amount of open market, uncontrolled vaccines, but is nevertheless not much considering
that Pakistan has a population of 51,1 million cattle, 56,9
million buffaloes, 50,3 million sheep and 123,9 million
goats [4].
The majority of commercial dairy farmers are vaccinating
their animals against FMD, either with imported trivalent
vaccine, e.g. Aftovax (Merial, France), or with a locally
produced monovalent vaccine (serotype O) [6].
Major challenges to control FMD in Pakistan relate, in
part, to the lack of sufficient resources for diagnosis and
continuous FMD genotype surveillance, but also the difficulties of controlling the vaccine market, as well as the
lack of basic biosecurity awareness and control of animal
movements. The latter is also hampered by the annual
religious festival Eid ul-Azza, where thousands of buffaloes, cattle and small ruminants are transported across the
country.
The present work focuses on the Landhi Dairy Colony
(LDC), located in the suburbs of Karachi in the Sindh
province of South-Pakistan. LDC is the largest dairy colony in Pakistan and the largest Buffalo colony in the
world. It was established in 1959 within an area of 752
acres (incl. 250 acres for roads, shops and other facilities)
for 15,000 animals, but there are now more than 300,000
dairy animals (> 95% buffaloes) on approximately 2000
farms and an unknown number of sheep and goats, which
are freely running around in the whole colony. This overPage 2 of 16

load, and unclear land ownership leads to hygiene and
environmental problems. The majority of the milking animals in LDC are kept only for one lactation phase and
consequently approximately 10–12% of the population is
replaced every month.
After the lactation period the majority of the animals are
sold to breeders or for slaughter and only a few are kept by
the dairy farmers for re-breeding. Most of the animals are
brought to and from the animal rich districts of Punjab
and Sindh provinces.
Previous studies employing participatory epidemiology
indicated a relatively high annually FMD prevalence
between 41% and 50% in the southern Sindh region
around Karachi [6].
To develop an effective vaccination strategy it is crucial to
understand the dynamic of the disease and thereby indicating the best time points of administering the vaccine.
Thus, individually vaccination is already performed on
the large ruminant population, but with vaccines of variable quality and efficiency, it is likely that the majority of
potential FMDV infections are subclinical and therefore
not recognised. From April 2006 to April 2007 we collected monthly a number of mouth-swabs from apparently healthy buffaloes and cattle, applying a convenient
sampling scheme based on a two-stage random sampling
setup, in conjunction with participatory information from
each selected farm. The total number of collected samples
was 960 mouth-swabs from 124 farms.
Furthermore, we collected epithelium samples from clinically affected animals as well as mouth-swab samples
from farms with a recent FMD outbreak, and 180 serum
samples collected from slaughtered animals in the period
from October 2006 to March 2007. The collection of
probang and blood samples from living cattle or buffaloes
was considered not possible due to socio-religious reasons.
Samples have been screened for FMDV by real-time RTPCR [11,12] and the partial 1D coding region of selected,
FMDV positive isolates, has been sequenced. In addition,
the full 1D coding region of a locally produced monovalent vaccine (serotype O) has been sequenced to examine
the relatedness of vaccine strain to the circulating serotype
O lineages. Serum samples have been analysed by applying serotype O, A and Asia 1 specific antibody ELISA [13]
and non-structural proteins (NSP) ELISA [14].
This work will help to develop an appropriate vaccination
strategy for Pakistan's largest dairy colony, including the
choice of the best matching vaccines, as well as helping to
improve our understanding of the epidemiology of FMD.

Results
Infection prevalence
We randomly selected farms in LDC and took swab samples from randomly selected animals for a subsequently
screening for FMDV genome by real-time RT-PCR. We
aimed to get information from farms where no animals
with clinical signs of FMD were present, judged by personal examination or by examination done by the local
veterinarians and information from the respective farmer.
If there has been at least one animal showing either acute
FMD or healing FMD lesions, we excluded those farms
from the FMDV infection prevalence analysis at aggregate
level and calculated the within-farm prevalence separately
for detecting potential FMDV prevalence differences.

Table 1 shows the prevalence of each FMDV infectionpositive farm, without any signs of clinical FMD, per
month in relation to the farm population. Confidence
intervals were calculated for a normal distributed population without finite population correction factor. This
means that some confidence intervals related to a very
small sample size or extreme point estimates are doubtful
(shown in grey in Table 1). However, we believe that the
shown point estimates, i.e. prevalence values, are reliable
and that the shown confidence intervals give useful, additional information. The mean prevalence for those farms
with PCR-positive animals that were randomly selected
and without animals showing clinical signs of FMD, is
19.2% (SE 3.99%). Table 2 shows the prevalence for each
infection positive found farm per month on which during
the sampling, animals with healing FMD lesions were
detected. The mean prevalence here is 53.9% (SE
15.08%). Applying t-test statistics demonstrate that the
mean prevalence in the latter group was significant higher
than in the farms where no animals with healing lesions
were detected. The t-statistic for H1 (mean prevalence on
farms with animals with healing FMD lesions > prevalence on farms without animals with healing FMD
lesions) at the 0.05 critical alpha level, t(22) = 3.17, p=
0.0022. For farms with ongoing FMD, i.e. at least one animal show signs of acute FMD, a mean prevalence of 87%
could be detected (Table 3). As swab samples for the latter
were only collected in April 2006 from two farms with
acute FMD, the sample size was considered to be too low
to allow a meaningful statistical analysis. However, the
FMDV prevalence in these two farms appeared higher
than in the farms containing animals with healing lesions.
Figure 1 displays the FMDV infection prevalence at aggregate level from April 2006 to April 2007, based on the
number of inapparently infected animals found in a twostage sampling scheme. The farm-level (herd-level) prevalence reflects the number of farms with positive animals,
calculated as the proportion of Σ farms with infected animals per month to Σ farms sampled per month, and the

Confidence intervals were calculated for a normal distributed population without finite population correction factor. This means that some
confidence intervals related to very small sample size or extreme point estimates are doubtful (shown in grey).

antibody ELISA for those 180 samples per month and
serotype. The data for serotype O shows a high amount of
antibodies (low ODP) for the whole period of time, with
a small variance of measured values. The same is true for
serotype A.

animal-level prevalence reflect the number of FMDV positive found animals within the sampled population, calculated as the proportion of Σ animals infected per month
to Σ animals sampled per month (see also additional file
1). Both prevalence values are shown with the exact binomial confidence interval, a method using the cumulative
probabilities of the binomial distribution and therewith
expressing the situation in the whole LDC. Both measures
show an endemic, frequent occurrence of FMD in the colony, with peaks in August 2006, December 2006 and February 2007 to March 2007. In conformity with the
prevalence, the precipitation peaks in August, December,
February and March. Applying the Pearson-correlation
statistics for animal-level prevalence to precipitation demonstrates a significant association, with a correlation coefficient ρ = 0.57 and the t-statistic for H1 (ρ > 0) at the 0.05
critical alpha level, t(11) = 2.27, p= 0.021.

In our analysis antibodies against serotypes Asia 1 and C,
show generally a higher variance per month than those
against the other serotypes, but the Median for each
month is clearly positive (Figure 2). All 180 samples have
been the tested for antibodies against the non-structural
proteins of FMDV and all but four have been found positive (Figure 3 and additional file 2).
Figure 3 shows the distribution of all 180 collected serum
samples per serotype at a serum dilution of 1/5. A high
antibody response (ODP < 10) can be seen for serotypes
A and O and against the non-structural proteins (NSP).
The median for the antibody response against Asia 1 has
an ODP value of 12 and against serotype C of 18 respectively.

Moreover, the moving average analysis (Figure 1), which
removes random variations within the point estimates,
show an appreciable increase from December 2006 to
March 2007, expressing the cumulative effect of the second rain season, the Eid ul-Azza festival and possibly the
slightly cooler temperature during this period. The temperature in Karachi between April 2006 and April 2007
ranged between 20°C and 30,5°C.

We randomly selected ten serum samples to determine
the highest serum dilution that gives a positive signal in
ELISA for each serotype (Figure 4). The Median for all
tested serotypes, except for serotype C, is positive with a
serum dilution of 1/320. Some tested sera are still positive
at a dilution 1/640 and above. The highest serum dilution
that gives a positive signal for serotype C is 1/40
(Median). The calculated ODP means for the serotypes O,
A and Asia1 are at a 1/5 serum-dilution 9 (σ = 4), 6 (σ =
1), 8 (σ = 6), and those result in an endpoint-titre of 1/
320, with a standard deviation of one twofold dilution
step. For serotype C the calculated ODP mean at a 1/5
serum-dilution is 20 (σ = 2), resulting in an endpoint-titre
of 1/40, with a standard deviation of one dilution step.

Participatory information
During sampling the owners of the farms have been interviewed with regard to their FMD vaccine practice. Table 4
shows that 88% of all questioned farmers vaccinated their
animals. Of those, 79% were using the trivalent Aftovaxvaccine (Merial, France) and 9% the local monovalent
(serotype O) vaccine. Four percent of the farmers were
vaccinating their animals on regular basis twice a year,
whereas the majority of the farmers vaccinated only the
new entrants to the farm. All interviewed farmers, which
vaccinated their animals, administered the vaccine only
once and not as recommend with an additional booster
vaccination two to six weeks after the initial vaccination.

Furthermore we determined for those ten selected serum
samples the endpoint-titre in virus neutralisation for each
serotype (Figure 5). Generally; the virus neutralisation
titres are consistent with the results of the ELISA titration.
The Median for all tested serotypes, except for serotype C,
has an endpoint-titre of equal or above 1/100. VNT analysis for serotype O isolates displays a relative small variance with a Median of approximately 1/100. Serotype A
isolates display the highest variance, but with a Median of

Sero-surveillance
From October 2006 to March 2007 we collected monthly
serum samples from 30 randomly selected Asian Buffaloes in LDC at the local slaughter house, immediately after
the death of the animals. Figure 2 shows the results of the

Phylogenetic analysis
Out of the 106 FMDV positive swab-samples from animals with and without clinical signs it was possible to
sequence the partial or full 1D coding region, which
encodes for the immuno-dominant VP1 surface protein,
from 58 samples. In addition we sequenced the full 1D
%

genome region of 17 epithelium samples collected during
2006, mainly from LDC, but also some from outside LDC
and from farms around Islamabad. From all sequenced
samples, 19 belong to serotype O, hereof ten epithelium
samples, and 56 to serotype A, hereof seven epithelium
samples.

from Bhutan/Nepal, collected between 2003 and 2004.
The latter belong to a new PanAsia lineage described by
the OIE/FAO World Reference Laboratory for Foot-andMouth Disease in 2007 and designated PanAsia II [15].

amino acid sequence of the partial VP1 sequence of the
serotype O isolates and related sequences from Malaysia,
Bhutan and Nepal. There is a very high amino acid conservation between those isolates, even as they are collected
during a time range from 2003 to 2006. However, the
Pakistan isolates are clearly distinct to the isolates from
Malaysia, Bhutan and Nepal at residues 143 and 200. Residue 143, located four amino acids before the RGD motif
in the GH-loop, in the Pakistan isolates contain a histidine, whereas the others, similar to the majority of other
published serotype O sequences, have a proline at this
position; thus proline has a cyclic ring and its presence
creates a fixed kink in a protein chain, its presence lead to
a change in the secondary structure. Furthermore, residue
200 in the isolates from Pakistan contains asparagine
instead of serine, as the majority of other published serotype O sequences.
Figure 9 shows the phylogram of the serotype A isolates.
All Pakistani isolates belong to the recent discovered A/
Iran/2005 lineage. The branch lengths here are, typically
for serotype A, larger than those of serotype O.

Virulence and host species
It has been shown previously that of those animals in this
study infected with the FMDV A/Iran/2005 lineage, the
majority of clinically affected animals are cattle [16].
Regarding the FMDV type O infected animals; six of ten
epithelium samples from clinically affected animals are
from buffaloes and only one of seven subclinically
infected animals originate from cattle. This displays the
LDC population of more then 95% Asian Buffaloes and
indicates an equal distribution of serotype O caused clinical FMD between bovine and buffalo species. In contrast
to the A/Iran/2005 lineage, where the occurrence of clinical FMD seems to be host species dependent, is there no
indication of host species dependence in the serotype O
caused outbreaks.

Discussion
Landhi Dairy Colony contains a relatively high proportion of vaccinated cattle and buffaloes (Table 4). However, the vaccination is mainly performed once and
mainly on newly introduced animals. Within such a population a high FMDV challenge, with the vaccine covered
sero/sub-type, against animals with a high immunity or a
low challenge in animals with low vaccine titres, may

both produce subclinical disease [12,17]. During our
study we have seen only a sporadic occurrence of animals
with clinical signs of FMD, mainly in April 2006 and
mainly in cattle. The latter may be explained by our findings that the majority of FMDV infections were caused by
the A/Iran/2005 lineage, which seems to cause mainly
subclinical disease in buffaloes [16] and thereby possibly
outplay the serotype O FMDV, but also through the relatively better efficiency of the applied vaccines towards
serotype O. Nevertheless, we have detected an endemic
FMDV infection occurrence (Figure 1), i.e. an endemic
occurrence of mainly subclinical FMD, peaking in August
2006 and December 2006 to March 2007. The maxima in
August and December are in clear correlation to the measured precipitation and consequently with the increased

humidity during the rainy periods. The relationship
between humidity and virus transmission/stability has
been described in several publications [18-21]. The prevalence peaks in February and March 2007 can be explained
by the cumulative effect of humidity, cooler temperature
and the introduction of new animals, potentially FMD
infected, from all over the country during the Eid ul-Azza
festival. Assuming that the incubation period of FMD in
Asian Buffaloes is similar to that in cattle, i.e. 2 to 14 days
[1,22] the spread of FMDV to the whole colony in February and March is likely, in particular considering the
intensive movement of animals and the lack of biosecurity awareness.

Given that the detection window for FMDV in mouth
swabs by real-time RT-PCR is approximately 14 days [12]
and that our results indicate a FMDV infection mean prevalence of 19,2% per month (Table 1), a yearly FMDV incidence proportion of approximately 458% (calculated as
incidence proportion = prevalence/duration) can be
assumed, which means that there is a high risk that a very
large proportion, if not all, animals in LDC become
infected with FMDV during the period of one year. Id est,
there is continuous FMDV circulation in LDC. This FMDV
maintenance in LDC bear also a risk of FMDV spreading
to other parts of Pakistan, hence animals that leave the
colony, e.g. for re-breeding, can be infected and transmit
the disease to other animal populations.
The serological analysis shows that 176 of 180 serologically tested animals are positive in NSP ELISA and the
majority of those animals have been confronted with
structural antigens from all present serotypes. However,
this does not necessarily mean that they have acquired
immunity by becoming infected with each serotype. We
consider it more likely that those animals have been vaccinated with multivalent vaccines, either after they have
had an infection or the vaccine strain has not matched
with the circulating strain. The relatively low titres for

serotype C support this consideration, since only a minority of available vaccines contain serotype C antigens. Even
if it is possible that they have been vaccinated with a not
properly inactivated or purified vaccine, does the relative
strong signals for the NSP ELISA (Figure 3) not support
this, assuming that there is some form of a NSP purification step included in the vaccine production, even in the
black market vaccines.
Figure 5 shows that the calculated median endpoint-titre,
in the virus neutralisation assay, for all tested serotypes,
except for serotype C, is equal or above 1/100 and thus a
good protection status of the tested animals against the
serotypes O, A and Asia 1 can be assumed. The relatively
low endpoint-titre of 1/50 for serotype C may indicate
that vaccines containing this very seldom serotype are still
in use in Pakistan, but not as frequently administered to
the animals as vaccines for the other serotypes and likely
not recently boosted by circulating serotype C FMDV.
Compared with the ELISA titration (Figure 4), were the
median endpoint-titres of the serotypes O, A and Asia 1
are equal at 1/320, is the endpoint-titre for serotype O
lower in the virus neutralisation assay. This can be
explained by the fact that both methods are performed
with the O Manisa lineage and that the ELISA is more

robust against virus lineage variations. Also, as we do not
have any further data on those serologically tested animals it can be assumed that the average age of the slaughtered buffaloes is between 4 and 7 years, based on the
information from farms were we collected mouth swab
samples. Furthermore, due to the tradition of keeping animals only for one lactation period and purchasing them
from other areas of Pakistan, this result represent more the
FMD situation of whole Pakistan than the particular situation in LDC, thus the time point of infection can have
been before the animal was brought to LDC.
The phylogenetic analysis of the 65% of the positive samples sequenced shows that primarily two virus-lineages
have circulated in LDC from April 2006 to April 2007.
Namely, A/Iran/2005, a serotype A lineage which caused
major outbreaks in cattle in Turkey, Egypt and Jordan during 2006 and 2007, and a Pakistan specific serotype O lineage. The A/Iran/2005 lineage is extensively described

elsewhere [16]. The serotype O sequences constitute a
monophyletic group, not related to the "old" PanAsia lineage, but related to the recently described PanAsia II lineage [15]. Thus, vaccine strains covering the PanAsia
lineage of serotype O, e.g. O Manisa-like vaccines, are not
necessary giving a good protection to this lineage. The latter is also supported by the differences of the median endpoint-titres for serotype O in ELISA and serum
neutralisation assay. Consequently, it can be argued that
those vaccines will lose their efficiency, after further
FMDV evolution, away from the "old" PanAsia lineage.
The most related sequences to the Pakistani originate,
with the exception of one sequence from Malaysia, from
Nepal and Bhutan collected during 2003 and 2004. A
common history of the Pakistan and Bhutan/Nepal lineage can not be excluded, but the fixed differences at residues 143 and 200 of the VP1 protein indicates that each
has established its own ecological niche.

and closely related published sequences (grey). The local produced monovalent vaccine (Lahore vaccine) is indicated in
red.

Remarkably, the sequence of the locally produced monovalent-O vaccine (Lahore vaccine) is nearly identical with
the sequences of the field strains. According to representatives of the vaccine company in Lahore, the company has
been using the same vaccine strain for approximately 30
years. However, it is the opinion of the authors that this
appears highly unlikely, due to the striking similarity of
the 1D vaccine sequence to the field samples sequence.
Probably, there has been an unmeant contamination of
the vaccine production unit or the information we
received from the company is not correct.

Conclusion
For an effective and realisable FMD control program in
LDC, we suggest to introduce a twice annually mass vaccination of all buffaloes and cattle in the colony. These mass
vaccinations should optimally take place shortly before

the beginning of the two rainy periods, e.g. in June and
September. Those vaccinations should, in our opinion, be
in addition to the already individually performed vaccinations of single animals, as the latter usually targets only
newly introduced animals. This suggested combination of
mass vaccination of all large ruminants with the already
performed individually vaccination should provide a continuous high level of herd immunity in the entire colony.
Vaccines used for this purpose should contain the matching vaccine strains, i.e. A/Iran/2005 and the regional type
of serotype O (PanAsia II), but also antigens of the, in this
world region endemic, Asia 1 lineage should be included.
As alternative for A/Iran/2005, a vaccine containing the
A22 lineage could potentially be used [23]. For covering
the O sublineage, the locally produced monovalent vaccine (Lahore vaccine) could be used, if it is assured that

this vaccine is similar to the one we purchased and that it
is properly inactivated, purified and with a sufficiently
high antigen content. It is important that a continuous
FMDV surveillance, including sublineage typing, is carried
out, to identify potentially newly introduced FMDV lineages and therewith subsequently to be enable good advice
on the choice of the best vaccine strains.
In the long term it will be important to control the vaccine
use, so that subclinical FMD will be avoided.

Methods
Sampling scheme and sample handling
A repeated cross-sectional survey has been performed by
collecting a minimum of 162 mouth swabs from randomly selected animals in selected farms (9 animals from
each of 18 farms) four times, during April and September
2006 and January and April 2007, combined with a
monthly sampling of approximately 30 swabs (5 animals
from each of 6 farms). The survey was based on a 2 stage
cluster-randomised setup, with farms as first unit of randomisation and animals on the farms as second unit. To
confirm an geographical randomised sampling we
indexed each selected farm by latitude and longitude with
a GPS device and plotted the coordinates, using GoogleEarth, on a map of LDC.

Mouth swabs have been taken from apparently healthy
animals. If during sampling, animals with healing lesions
were detected, those farms were excluded from prevalence
calculations for aggregate level prevalence (Figure 1).

In addition, we purchased a bottle containing the monovalent local produced type O vaccine in a drug store in
LDC.
Plain Plastic/Rayon swabs (Sterilin®, U.K.) in a sterile tube
have been used for mouth swab collection. The swab sample was taken by carefully holding the animal with the
mouth slightly open and than moving the swab up and
down on the surface of the tongue four to five times. The
tip of the swabs was than stored in a 2 ml tube containing
1 ml RLT-buffer (Qiagen, Germany), to preserve any viral
RNA present.
In addition, we collected epithelium samples from clinically affected animals. These animals were not randomly
selected. The tongue epithelium was collected from
unruptured or freshly ruptured vesicles by gently abrading
it with a glove, with rubber dots, grabbing the tongue with
the gloved hand and pulling along the surface.
Epithelium was than placed in vials containing buffered
glycerol (50% glycerol with 50% phosphate buffer, pH
7,6), and kept initially at 4°C and subsequently at -20°C.
All samples were, in compliance with the applicable regulations, sent to National Veterinary Institute, Technical
University of Denmark, Lindholm, for further analysis.
RT-PCR, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
Total RNA of all collected swab samples was extracted
using QIAamp RNA Blood Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The

Real-Time RT-PCR described by [11] was used to screen
the samples for FMDV RNA.
Tissue (50–100 mg) was homogenized in 1 ml RNApro™
Solution (Qbiogene, USA) in a Lysing Matrix D tube
(Qbiogene) using a FP 120 Fast Prep™ Cell Disruptor
(Qbiogene). Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy-Mini
Kit™ (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
cDNA synthesis for tissue samples and positive swab samples was done using Ready-To-Go™ You-Prime FirstStrand Beads (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Sweden),
employing the primers NV27T (IUPAC code) and random
hexamers pdN6 (IUPAC code).
Five µl of the template cDNA were added to 45 µl of the
PCR reaction mixture containing 0,2 µM primers, 200 µM
each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP, 10 mM Tris-HCl

(pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 1 U of AmpliTaq® Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, UK).
DNA was amplified with a DNA Thermal Cycler PE9700
(Perkin Elmer) by a two-step cycling reaction as follows:
95°C for 15 min, and five cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 57°C
for 2 min and 72°C for 30 sec, and then 35 cycles of 94°C
for 30 sec, 61°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 30 sec, followed
by a final extension step of 72°C for 10 min. PCR primers
used have been described elsewhere [16,24].
The resulting PCR products were examined by electrophoresis, using a 1,2% agarose gel, with a separation time
of 1.5 hours at 6.5 V/cm. Amplicons were visualised with
ethidium bromide and subsequently extracted and purified from the agarose gel with QIAquick Gel Extraction kit
(Qiagen). Cycle-sequencing, using PCR primers, was then
performed by Agowa GmbH, Germany.

Sequence assembling was performed with ContigExpress
(VectorNTI©-software) and multiple alignment was performed by log-expectation comparison, using the MUSCLE (v.3.6) software [25].
Models of evolution were determined by hierarchical
