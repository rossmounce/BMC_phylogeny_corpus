Abstract
Background: Concerted evolution occurs in multigene families and is characterized by stretches
of homogeneity and higher sequence similarity between paralogues than between orthologues.
Here we identify human gene pairs that have undergone concerted evolution, caused by ongoing
gene conversion, since at least the human-mouse divergence. Our strategy involved the
identification of duplicated genes with greater similarity within a species than between species.
These genes were required to be present in multiple mammalian genomes, suggesting duplication
early in mammalian divergence. To eliminate genes that have been conserved due to strong
purifying selection, our analysis also required at least one intron to have retained high sequence
similarity between paralogues.
Results: We identified three human gene pairs undergoing concerted evolution (BMP8A/B,
DDX19A/B, and TUBG1/2). Phylogenetic investigations reveal that in each case the duplication
appears to have occurred prior to eutherian mammalian radiation, with exactly two paralogues
present in all examined species. This indicates that all three gene duplication events were
established over 100 million years ago.
Conclusion: The extended duration of concerted evolution in multiple distant lineages suggests
that there has been prolonged homogenization of specific segments within these gene pairs.
Although we speculate that selection for homogenization could have been utilized in order to
maintain crucial homo- or hetero- binding domains, it remains unclear why gene conversion has
persisted for such extended periods of time. Through these analyses, our results demonstrate
additional examples of a process that plays a definite, although unspecified, role in molecular
evolution.

Background
Over the past few decades, gene duplications have been
recognized as one of the main forces capable of generating
large gene families with novel functions. In fact, duplications are thought to be one of the primary sources of

adaptive evolution given that they generate new genetic
material, and in doing so, create substrates that can
undergo divergence through mutations [1]. Thus, gene
duplications have the potential to affect genomic evolution dependent on the results of these mutations.

Duplicated genes are subject to the same forces that affect
the evolution of single copy genes. These include genetic
drift, which is opposed by negative or purifying selection,
and positive selection, which can fix advantageous
changes faster than expected by chance [2-4]. Additionally, other forces affect the evolution of duplicated genes.
Functional redundancy can permit the accumulation of
changes in one copy of the gene without negative consequences to an organism's proteome. Although this often
leads to silencing or deletion of one gene copy, it can also
lead to improvements on the ancestral functions or the
development of new functions [5-9]. Subfunctionalization [6,7], where an ancestral gene's functions are shared
between the descendant genes, and neofunctionalization
[5], where one copy acquires a novel gene function, are
possible consequences of divergence following gene
duplication.
Most duplicated genes tend to diverge over time [1,10].
However, in some instances the genes, or parts of the
genes, evolve together in a process known as concerted
evolution [8,9,11]. Essentially, instead of gene sequences
becoming progressively more dissimilar, the sequences
remain highly similar or even identical. Although low
divergence can also be explained by strong purifying selection, these two phenomena can be distinguished by comparisons across species. The hallmark of concerted
evolution is that high sequence similarity between genes
is maintained within a species (between paralogues)
while divergence occurs between species (between orthologues). This is distinct from strong purifying selection,
where divergence is impeded both within and between
species such that the function, which is highly susceptible
to changes, is preserved.
Concerted evolution between duplicated genes can be
caused by ongoing genetic exchange called gene conversion [12-14]. Gene conversion is the non-reciprocal
exchange of genetic material between homologous
sequences. This process can have both positive and negative consequences. Beneficially, gene conversion can
decrease mutational load, eliminate deleterious mutations, and spread advantageous alleles, thus playing a role
in adaptive evolution [13,14]. Conversely, gene conversion can produce harmful phenotypes, such as Gaucher
disease [15] and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome [16],
when disruptive mutations from a pseudogene are substituted into its functional duplicate. The duration and frequency of the exchange between duplicated sequences is
thought to be variable [11] and appears to depend upon
several factors, including the distance between sequences.
Several studies have shown a negative correlation between
the frequency of gene conversion and the distance
between homologous sequences [17,18], with a drop-off
in frequency at distances greater than 55 kb [19]. Addi-

tionally, regions undergoing gene conversion may be disrupted by a few key mutations, such as the insertion of
mobile elements or by the gradual accumulation of single
nucleotide mutations [20]. Gene conversion can be a stochastic process, and it is unclear what effect selection has
on the duration of gene conversion.
Gene conversion is also variable in the amount of gene
sequence involved. While some entire gene sequences
have undergone concerted evolution, others have a
mosaic evolution pattern. Under mosaic evolution, segments of the gene are homogenized and evolve in concert,
while others diverge without gene conversion [21]. This
can complicate phylogenetic reconstruction, often producing trees that appear to indicate that multiple, independent and parallel duplications have occurred [20,22].
Characteristically, regions undergoing gene conversion
have an elevated GC content relative to flanking
sequences [23-25]. Intragenically, this can be seen within
introns as well as at the third codon positions within
exons (GC3). An increased GC content can be explained
by the biased gene conversion (BGC) model, which
asserts that heteroduplexes formed during gene conversion are preferentially repaired to GC alleles over AT alleles [24,25]. This leads to an increase in GC fixation and an
elevated GC content. Biased DNA repair has been
reported in mammalian cells, lending weight to this
model [26]. This characteristic increase in GC content can
be used in support of other evidence that a region is
undergoing gene conversion.
Here we performed a whole genome analysis to look for
duplicated genes undergoing concerted evolution. Previous whole genome analyses have been conducted looking
for gene conversion in C. elegans [17], S. cerevisiae [18],
rodent genomes [19], bacterial genomes [27], the rice
genome [28] and D. melanogaster [29]. Until recently [30],
there were no whole genome analyses of gene conversion
in the human genome. Benovoy and Drouin [30] recently
used a whole genome approach to identify examples of
gene conversion in the human genome. However, their
analysis was restricted to multigene families with three or
more members. Our study differs in that we attempt to
identify gene pairs (gene families with only two members) created by duplication early in mammalian radiation that have maintained regions of high sequence
similarity due to ongoing gene conversion.
Our goal was to identify examples of gene conversion preserved in all, or a large majority, of mammalian species. A
small number of other genes, such as Oxct2a and Oxct2b,
EMR2 with CD97 and EMR3, TLR1 and TLR6, and CCR2
and CCR5 [31-34], have been reported to be evolving in
concert by gene conversion in multiple lineages. By look-

ing for duplicated genes in both the human and mouse
genomes with greater sequence percent identity between
paralogues than between orthologues, we identified three
gene pairs with signals of long enduring concerted evolution: BMP8A/B, DDX19A/B, and TUBG1/2. Two of these
(DDX19A/B, and TUBG1/2) are novel examples, while
one (BMP8A/B) has been reported previously [34]. We
also detail a detection strategy that can be applied to identify additional examples of genes evolving by this phenomenon. We performed extensive phylogenetic studies
and analyzed the selective pressures acting on the gene
pairs as well as their relative expression patterns in several
human tissues. Through these examinations we show that
gene conversion has been occurring between the gene
pairs for over 100 million years, and the extended duration of this process in multiple distant lineages suggests
that there has been prolonged selection for homogenization of segments within the genes.

Results
Identification of Gene Pairs
Using our search criteria, outlined in Methods [also see
Additional file 1], we were able to identify three gene pairs
as candidate loci for concerted evolution. Due to the filtering steps we utilized, each gene pair is less than 1 Mb apart
and shares high sequence similarity (>97%) in at least two
consecutive exons and their intervening intron. The three
gene pairs we identified are: BMP8A/B, DDX19A/B, and
TUBG1/2. Figure 1 shows the gene structure and orientation of these gene pairs in the human genome.

BMP8A and BMP8B are members of the bone morphogenesis protein family, a subfamily of the transforming
growth factor type beta (TGF-Î²) supergene family, found
on chromosome 1p34 approximately 235 Kb apart in an
inverted orientation. Each gene has seven exons with an
open reading frame (ORF) of 1209 bps encoding a protein
containing 402 amino acids. Bone morphogenesis proteins are known to be involved in vertebrate development
[35,36]. While little has been reported about their function in humans, this gene pair has been linked to involvement in reproductive system development in the mouse
(Bmp8a is expressed in the epididymis in males and the
decidual cells of the uterus in pregnant females; Bmp8b is
expressed in the germ cells of the testis in males and the
trophoblast cells of the placenta in pregnant females)
[37,38]. Concerted evolution of this gene pair was previously reported [34].
DDX19A and DDX19B are DEAD box helicase genes that
are found on chromosome 16q22.1. These genes are tandemly duplicated (direct orientation) 13 Kb apart. Both
genes have 12 exons but differ by 3 bps (CTG) in their
ORFs. While DDX19A's ORF transcript size is 1437 bps
(encoding a 478 aa protein), DDX19B has an additional

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/156

codon (1440 bps ORF encoding a 479 aa protein). Using
chicken, which has a single orthologue of DDX19, as an
outgroup, it is apparent that DDX19A has undergone a
deletion of 3 bps near the start of exon 3. This deletion is
seen in all investigated mammalian orthologues of
DDX19A, including opossum. Although the functions of
these genes are not well characterized, both genes are
thought to be ATP-dependent RNA helicases that are
involved in mRNA transport from the nucleus [39].
TUBG1 and TUBG2 are gamma tubulin genes on chromosome 17q21.31 and are situated in direct orientation
approximately 45 Kb apart. Both genes have 11 exons
with an ORF size of 1356 bps, encoding a protein with
451 amino acids. The gamma tubulin genes are components of the microtubule organizing centers where they
play a central role in the nucleation of microtubules
[40,41].
Identification of Orthologues
Using various techniques, including BLAT [42], BLAST
[43] and RT-PCR, we identified homologues of each gene
in additional organisms. In all three cases, orthologues of
both copies within the gene pair were identified in eutherian mammals, while only a single orthologue was found
in non-mammalian vertebrates. Also, in each mammalian
species investigated, only two copies of each gene could
be identified, indicating that these multigene families
have a consistent copy number of two in mammals. Interestingly, only a single orthologue of BMP8A/B was found
in the opossum, while orthologues appear to exist for
both genes from the DDX19A/B and TUBG1/2 gene pairs
in this organism. Although the low sequence coverage and
incomplete assembly of the opossum genome could prevent the identification of a second BMP8 orthologue,
another explanation involves different timings for the origins of these gene pairs. In each case, since two orthologues are present in all eutherian mammals examined,
the most parsimonious explanation is that a duplication
event occurred early in mammalian evolution. For
BMP8A/B, the absence of the duplication in opossum suggests that the duplication event occurred after the divergence of the opossum lineage (order Marsupialia) from the
armadillo (order Edentata). This would place the duplication event somewhere between 129 and 173 million years
ago (MYA) [44]. For DDX19A/B and TUBG1/2, the presence of the duplication in opossum suggests that the
duplication event is older, occurring before the divergence
of opossum lineage (>173 MYA).
Phylogenetic Analyses
We created phylogenetic trees using two different methods, Neighbor-joining (Figure 2) and maximum likelihood [see Additional file 2], to examine the evolution of
the duplicated gene pairs in the mammalian lineage.

used as outgroups to root the trees. Bootstrap values (10,000 replicates) are shown on the interior branches of the tree. A
distance scale is shown below each tree. Underlined species in a) are missing exon 1, preventing the use of this exon in the
phylogenetic analysis (see Methods). Additionally, maximum likelihood trees were created for comparison and show highly
similar patterns of evolution with the above trees [see Additional file 2].

Comparison of the trees created by these two different
methods showed that the branching pattern and node
structure were highly similar in every case.

cent similarity between the human genes in divergent and
concerted regions was also generated [see Additional
file 6].

Generally, duplicated genes that undergo divergent evolution display a tree in which the orthologues cluster and are
monophyletic. In contrast, duplicated genes that evolve in
a concerted fashion display trees where paralogues cluster.
Examining the phylogenetic trees in Figure 2, it is apparent that these trees show signatures of both types of evolution. For example, in Figure 2b, DDX19A and its three
primate orthologues are monophyletic, as is DDX19B and
its primate orthologues. A similar phylogeny is also seen
in the rodent lineage. This pattern is typical of divergent
evolution. In contrast, the pattern for dog, cow, horse and
opossum is distinct in that the paralogues group together.
This could be indicative of concerted evolution. An alternate explanation for this pattern involves multiple independent duplications. DDX19A/B's phylogeny could be
explained by six independent duplications (in primates,
rodents, dog, cow, horse and opossum). However, a single
duplication that predates the mammalian divergence
would be a more parsimonious explanation. In this
hypothesis, mosaic evolution, where some exons evolve
divergently and others evolve concertedly, would explain
the mixture of evolutionary patterns seen in the phylogenetic trees.

Evidence of Gene Conversion
One cause of concerted evolution is gene conversion. To
look for statistically significant evidence of homogenization, we used the program Geneconv [45]. Multiple alignments, both of the ORFs and the genomic sequences, were
used as input for Geneconv in order to detect candidate
fragments of aligned gene conversion. The results identify
several statistically significant fragments in both the ORF
alignments and the genomic sequence alignments (Table
1). From the table, it is clear that the regions detected by
Geneconv overlap to a large degree with the peaks of high
sequence identity between paralogues (Figure 1 and the
sliding window analysis [see Additional files 3 and 4]).

To test this hypothesis, we performed a sliding window
analysis on the gene pairs [see Additional files 3 and 4]
then built new phylogenetic trees (Figure 3) after separating the exons into divergently or concertedly evolving categories [also see Additional file 5]. Both analyses favor the
conclusion that these gene pairs are evolving in a mosaic
pattern. The exons were categorized as divergently or concertedly evolving using a combination of the mVISTA
identities shown in Figure 1, the sliding window plots [see
Additional files 3 and 4], and a visual inspection of the
multiple alignments. Figure 3 shows that categorizing the
exons before building phylogenetic trees is sufficient to
separate the two signatures of evolution observed in Figure 2 [also see Additional file 5]. The divergent gene trees
for DDX19A/B and TUBG1/2 (Figure 3b and 3c) show
monophyletic clades in which all the eutherian mammal
orthologues cluster. This phylogeny is not seen for
BMP8A/B, except for in the rodent lineage, but can be
explained by the greater stretch of high similarity between
paralogues in non-rodent mammals (Figure 1 and sliding
window analysis [see Additional files 3 and 4]). In contrast, the convergent gene trees for all three gene pairs (Figure 3d, e and 3f) have paralogues grouping together in
almost all instances. The only exceptions are the human
and chimpanzee branches in DDX19A/B and TUBG1/2.
These phylogenetic trees illustrate that these gene pairs
have evolved in a mosaic pattern. A summary of the per-

Increased GC content at the third codon position and in
introns has also been used as evidence for gene conversion [25,33]. GC content was calculated for each gene in
both the divergent and concerted regions in multiple species. The average GC content was calculated at each of the
codon positions and plotted with p-values ascertained
within the human sequences using a Fisher Exact Test
and/or Yates-corrected Chi-square test (Figure 4). For
BMP8A/B, only rodent sequences were used because in
other species all of the exons appear to be evolving in concert. From these plots, it is clear that there is a significant
difference (P < 0.05) in the third codon position for
DDX19A/B and TUBG1/2 (Figure 4b, c). However,
although there is an increase in the third codon position
of the rodent Bmp8a/b (Figure 4a), the difference is not
significant. A similar comparison was undertaken using
the introns from these three gene pairs. Again, a significant increase in GC content is seen in the introns that
appear to be evolving under concerted evolution, as
opposed to the introns evolving divergently as well as 10
kb of upstream and downstream flanking sequence (Figure 4d). Taken together with the results from Geneconv,
the increase in GC content suggests that gene conversion
is the cause of the concerted evolution in these three gene
pairs.
Sequence Evolution and Functional Domains
We investigated the selective pressures working on these
gene pairs by calculating the dN/dS ratios between the
orthologues. Of interest was whether the regions evolving
divergently were under different selective pressures than
the regions evolving in concert. Average dN/dS values, calculated using pairs of orthologues, are shown in Table 2.
Values of dN/dS are calculated for the whole gene, as well
as the regions evolving divergently and concertedly (as
previously defined). As you can see from this table, five of
the six values of dN/dS for the concerted regions are lower

than the dN/dS values for the divergent regions. This suggests that either these regions are under more negative
selective pressure or it could indicate that a consequence
of gene conversion is lower nonsynonymous divergence
between sequences.
We also performed sliding window and PAML analyses to
further examine the dN/dS values in the gene pairs [see
Additional files 7 and 8]. Although the results from some
analyses show suggestions of positive selection, no significant evidence was found. Therefore, there does not
appear to be an overlap between the regions undergoing
concerted evolution and positive selection. Conversely,
there is some evidence indicating that the regions undergoing concerted evolution have lower dN/dS values, suggesting that both gene conversion and purifying selection
are acting at these sites.
Additionally, we looked to see if the regions undergoing
concerted evolution contained or overlapped with specific
functional domains within these genes. However, in each
case there did not appear to be any significant overlap of
the functional domains with the regions undergoing concerted evolution [see Additional file 9]. Although parts of
some domains overlap regions of concerted evolution,
there is no clear relationship that could indicate the selection for gene conversion limited to a particular domain. In
some cases, the exons involved in concerted evolution fall
outside of the known functional domains. This could
indicate that there is another functional domain in these
exons that has not been previously described.
Gene Expression Analysis
We performed gene expression analyses to determine
whether there is differential tissue expression within the

gene pairs. We used qPCR and pyrosequencing assays to
attain a ratio of expression between the two members of
the gene pair. However, the BMP8A/B gene pair was resistant to both assays. Therefore, although we were able to
obtain measurements of expression for DDX19A/B and
TUBG1/2, the expression analysis of BMP8A/B is limited
to previously published reports in mice.
For DDX19A/B, we were able to use both qPCR (exon 7)
and pyrosequencing (exons 8 and 10) to obtain expression ratios (Figure 5a). Although the values for each assay
are slightly different, the overall trend is consistent. There
appears to be several tissues where the expression level of
the two genes is similar (lung, liver, bone marrow, kidney
and fetal brain). However, in several other tissues the
expression level of DDX19A is higher than the expression
level of DDX19B (brain, smooth muscle, skeletal muscle,
placenta, and fetal heart). In these tissues, it appears that
DDX19B is expressed at about one half to three quarters
the level of DDX19A, with the highest degree of differential expression seen in skeletal muscle.
Although the expression level difference between
DDX19A and DDX19B is not considerable in most tissues,
the expression ratio for TUBG1 and TUBG2 is more
remarkable (Figure 5b). Again we used both qPCR (exon
11) and pyrosequencing (exon 8) to obtain expression
ratios. Similarly, both assays are relatively consistent in
their findings, although there are some small differences
in their absolute values. Interestingly, for this gene pair
there are several tissues where there is a significant difference in the level of expression between the two genes.
Unlike DDX19A/B, where either the expression was equal
or one gene (DDX19A) was higher in expression, there are
some tissues where TUBG1 shows higher expression

(liver, skeletal muscle and bone marrow), some tissues
where TUBG2 shows higher expression (brain, smooth
muscle and fetal brain) and some tissues where expression is relatively equal (lung, placenta, kidney and fetal
heart). Also, the magnitudes of the expression differences
are considerably larger in this gene pair, ranging from four
to five times higher expression of TUBG1 in liver and bone
marrow, to five to six times higher expression of TUBG2 in
brain. Thus, the TUBG1/2 gene pair is differentially
expressed in several tissues.
We performed additional analysis looking for regulatory
regions upstream of each gene to try to assess whether
gene pairs share promoters or enhancers. However, in
general it appears that the upstream regulatory regions
have diversified throughout the gene pair evolution, even
though regions within the genes have evolved in concert
[see Additional file 10].

Discussion
We have identified three duplicated gene pairs arising
early in mammalian evolution that have undergone concerted evolution via gene conversion. While one of these
gene pairs has been previously reported to be evolving in
concert [34], the other two pairs are novel. These findings,
identified using a genome-wide strategy, increase by 50%
the number of identified cases of human gene pairs
undergoing this process for such an extended period of
time. In each case, the two copies of the gene are separated
by less than 250 kb of sequence in the human genome
and we have inferred that duplication occurred over 129
MYA.
Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that each pair of genes
has regions evolving in concert in all examined mammalian species (Figure 3). Concerted evolution in multigene
families is thought to occur by two mechanisms: unequal
crossing over and gene conversion. While unequal cross-

ing over is often invoked to explain concerted evolution
within tandemly-arrayed gene families, gene conversion is
used to explain concerted evolution of duplicated genes
(copy number of two) and mosaic evolution [9,20,21].
This is because gene conversion can homogenize parts of
a gene without changing the copy number. Since all of the
eutherian mammals examined have evidence of only two
copies of these genes, it is unlikely that unequal crossing
over is the basis for the observed concerted evolution. For
additional proof of gene conversion, we used the program
Geneconv and also looked for a significant increase in GC
content. Although homogenization or increased GC
by themselves do not prove gene conversion is acting
within these regions, in combination with mosaic evolution (Figures 1 and 3) and a consistent copy number (two
genes), this evidence supports gene conversion, rather
than unequal crossing over, as the cause of the concerted
evolution in these gene pairs. Also, although the homogenization of the gene pairs could have been achieved by a
single gene conversion event in each mammal, our evidence is more in line with multiple gene conversion
events throughout evolution leading to concerted evolution of the gene pairs.
It is interesting that gene conversion between these gene
pairs appears to have been active for over 100 million
years and has resulted in concerted evolution in every
mammal examined. The duration of gene conversion is
thought to be variable and often stochastic in nature
[11,20]. Therefore, although gene conversion could occur
between two loci for over 100 million years by chance, it
is expected to do so only in rare instances. Thus, it appears
highly unlikely that gene conversion would be maintained coincidentally for over 100 million years in multiple lineages. Consequently, we speculate that if gene
conversion is seen consistently at the same loci for an
extended length of time, there may have been selection for

this process and the maintenance of homogenized gene
sequences.
The duration and prevalence of gene conversion within
these gene pairs is suggestive of selection for homogenization and co-evolution. However, the basis for this proposed selection is unclear. Our analyses do not show any
obvious overlap of the regions evolving in concert with
protein domains or known functional sequences. Nevertheless, a few previous reports have identified similar patterns of concerted evolution which could provide clues as
to why gene conversion can be maintained for such
extended periods of time. Three of the reports describing
similar gene pairs suggest that protein binding co-evolution between two genes might be the basis for the conserved gene conversion. The Vazquez-Salat et al [33]
study, which looks at gene conversion between CCR2 and
CCR5, suggests that along with homodimerization, these
proteins also heterodimerize, creating a synergistic effect
which enhances their function. Similarly, Kruithof [31]
and Kwakkenbos [32] looked at gene conversion between
TLR1 and TLR6 and between EMR2, CD97 and EMR3,
respectively, and suggest that gene conversion may be
used to conserve or co-evolve binding regions. These
papers propose that mosaic evolution maintains structural or binding regions, while receptor, ligand binding or
other functional domains are allowed to diverge. A similar
proposal can be applied to explain the mosaic evolution
identified in the three gene pairs we investigated. Additionally, the conserved boundaries of the mosaic evolution in multiple species further supports the idea that
while some regions are co-evolving to maintain a specific
function, other regions are diverging in both sequence
and function.
Interestingly, if we look at the protein binding of the gene
pairs we identified, there are some indications these proteins have conserved binding partners. We speculate that
gene conversion has been utilized to maintain perfect
homology at binding sites. Additionally, our results indicate that the regions undergoing gene conversion tend to
have lower dN/dS values than the sequences evolving
divergently (Table 2 and dN/dS sliding window analysis
[see Additional files 7 and 8]). This suggests a second
process, stronger negative selection in combination with
gene conversion, has been utilized to conserve these sites.
An example of binding site co-evolution occurs between
BMP8A and BMP8B, which, like other BMP8 proteins,
work as homodimers [46,47]. These proteins could theoretically interact and form heterodimers, similar to the
interaction of BMPs -4 and -7 [48]. Perhaps a heterodimer
would perform an additional or enhanced function. Similarly, by assessing TUBG1 and TUBG2 binding partners
using NCBI's Entrez database [49] it is clear from in vivo
evidence, based on affinity capture experiments, that both
proteins interact with PXN, RNF19A, and TUBGCP3. In

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/156

this case, although there is no evidence that the protein
products of TUBG1/2 interact with each other directly,
they may interact with the same partners and thus need to
share a highly similar or identical binding domain.
Although similar evidence is not available for DDX19A/B,
shared binding partners may be identified by functional
interaction analyses of these proteins. However, our assertion that gene conversion is being selected to maintain
binding sites is purely speculative. While it appears that
selection may be acting to maintain gene conversion
within these regions, the purpose and evolutionary implications of this process are still largely unknown.
Our gene expression analyses of DDX19A/B and TUBG1/2
(Figure 5) indicate that although these genes could share
some functions, they may act in different tissues. This is a
form of subfunctionalization. An example occurs in
rodent Bmp8a/b, which have been shown to have differential expression in the mouse reproductive system [37,38].
The most striking example of subfunctionalization was
the differences seen in the expression between TUBG1 and
TUBG2. These genes appear to have significantly different
expression in six of the ten examined tissues (three with
higher TUBG1 expression, and three with higher TUBG2
expression). These results agree with previously reported
expression analyses of these genes, such as the increased
expression of TUBG1 in liver and TUBG2 in brain [40,41].
This could indicate that the genes have different functional relevance in different tissues. We attribute the subfunctionalization of tissue expression patterns observed
in the three gene pairs to the divergence of regulatory
regions upstream of each gene. When we examine 10 kb
of sequence upstream of each gene, we see little to no
overlap in predicted or known enhancers and conserved
transcription binding sites. These results again show the
mosaic pattern of evolution within these gene pairs,
where some regions evolve in concert to maintain function. Other regions, including regulatory regions, are not
preserved, leading to diverging functions and subfunctionalization.

Conclusion
In conclusion, it appears that gene or domain homogenization caused by extended periods of gene conversion can
result in concerted evolution that may be maintained, perhaps by selection, throughout mammalian evolution. We
speculate that this process is being used to maintain
homo- or hetero- binding domains within gene pairs. We
have identified additional examples of this relatively rare
form of evolution and, although it is rare, postulate that it
has relevance within gene duplication evolution

Methods
Identification of Gene Pairs
To search for gene pairs potentially undergoing concerted
evolution, we initially used MEGABLAST [50] to compare

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:156

the masked human genome (Build 36; hg18) against
itself. We then filtered out self-hits to look for regions of
the human genome that have high sequence identity to
another region (>90% identity over 100 bp). Next, using
the genomic coordinates of all Refseq genes, we look for
duplicated regions that overlap genes. At this stage, these
duplications could be intronic or exonic. The next step
involved isolating genes that shared higher levels of
sequence identity (>97%) spanning two consecutive
exons and an intervening intron (exon x - intron x - exon
x+1 matching exon y - intron y - exon y+1) [see Additional
file 1]. At this stage, the dataset was large (containing
1260 hits) and comprised mainly of recently expanded
gene families. To simplify our dataset, we next performed
two filtering steps that greatly reduced the number of hits.
We filtered for i) copy number, keeping only the hits that
were present as a pair and ii) gene distance, keeping only
the hits that were located less than 1 Mb apart. We filtered
for copy number because this would eliminate large gene
families that could be undergoing concerted evolution
through the process of unequal crossing over. We filtered
for gene distance since gene conversion seems to be
enriched between sequences that are closer together [1719]. The choice of a 1 Mb cutoff was arbitrary. However, it
appears to be generous given that it has been shown that
most examples of gene conversion have been found separated by less than 55 kb of intervening sequence [19].
The dataset (containing 182 hits) created by these filtering
steps contained human duplicated gene pairs that share
greater than 97% identity in at least two consecutive exons
and the intervening intron and are less than 1 Mb apart.
However, this dataset is predisposed to contain mostly
recent duplications. To eliminate these, we manually
compared our dataset with the mouse genome to see if a
corresponding gene pair (or more copies) existed. If only
a single gene was found in mouse, we concluded that the
duplication was recent (occurred after the human-mouse
divergence). If a gene pair was also seen in mouse, there
are at least two possible explanations: the gene was independently duplicated in both the mouse and human
genomes or the gene was duplicated a single time in a
common ancestor (before human-mouse divergence). To
rule out independent duplications, we manually looked
for the duplication in other mammals (initially rat and
dog, but then expanded to all other mammals available).
In some instances the genes did appear to be independently duplicated (such as ELA3A/B, data not shown).
However, an ancestral duplication was apparent in three
of the gene pairs. These gene pairs were kept for further
analysis.
Analysis of Gene Pairs
Initial analysis of the gene pairs was performed using the
UCSC genome browser [51]. Using the utilities and data

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/156

present within this browser, we were able to obtain the
sequence and structure of each gene of interest. We then
used mVISTA [52,53] to compare the gene pairs' genomic
sequences (exonic and intronic) with one another
(Figure 1).
We then expanded our analysis to additional mammalian
genomes. Using a combination of BLAT against the UCSC
genome browser [42], BLAST against multiple NCBI databases including the trace archives [43] and RT-PCR using
primers (available upon request) designed within highly
conserved sequences of the gene, we were able to obtain
sequences from multiple mammals. Due to the incomplete assembly of available DNA sequences from many
organisms, we were occasionally unable to assemble the
full-length sequence of one or more orthologues. In these
instances, we eliminated the species from further phylogenetic analyses. However, for BMP8A/B, exon 1 has a high
GC content which prevented PCR amplification of its
sequence. Hence, we were unable to confirm this exon in
four genes within the eight species with assembled
sequences (4 of the 15 genes). Therefore, the phylogenetic
analyses for this gene pair do not include exon 1.
Once these sequences were obtained, we used two different tools, MEGA3 [54] and PAUP [55] to analyze the phylogeny of the gene pairs. ClustalW [56] was used to align
the cDNA sequences. This was followed by manual correction of the alignments. These corrected alignments were
then used to create Neighbor-joining trees under the
Tamura-Nei model of evolution in MEGA3 and replicated
with 10,000 bootstraps. To verify the structure of these
trees, we used PAUP [55,57] to create maximum likelihood trees. The likelihood settings used by PAUP were
determined using MODELTEST [58] to select the best-fit
model by hLRT (parameters available upon request).
Using regions delimited by the mVISTA and sliding window [see Additional files 3 and 4] results, we performed
additional phylogenetic analyses (same methods as
described above) to compare the regions evolving divergently to the regions evolving in concert.
Evidence of Gene Conversion
We used two methods to look for evidence of gene conversion. First we used Geneconv [45] to look for regions that
have statistically significant evidence for gene conversion.
For this program, we used alignments created by clustalW
[56] (cDNA) and by CHAOS with DIALIGN [59]
(genomic DNA) as the input. Geneconv was then able to
detect candidate fragments of aligned gene conversion
between the gene pairs (mismatches allowed).

Second, we looked for evidence of increased GC content
in the third codon position and in introns of the regions
undergoing concerted evolution. Using MEGA3, GC con-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:156

tent was calculated in multiple sequences from both
exonic and intronic sequences, as well as 10 kb of
upstream and downstream flanking sequence of each
gene. These sequences were divided into regions evolving
in concert versus regions evolving divergently. GC contents were calculated as an average of five (BMP8A/B) or
eight (DDX19A/B and TUBG1/2) multiple sequences. The
GC content was compared between these regions and
Fisher Exact and Yates-corrected Chi-square statistical tests
were performed on the results to look for significant
enrichment of GC in regions evolving in concert.
Selection Analysis
We analyzed the selective pressures on the gene pairs by
calculating the dN/dS ratio between orthologues. These
ratios were calculated between pairs of orthologues using
MEGA3. Values were calculated for the whole gene
sequence, as well as divergently evolving and concertedly
evolving subsections of the sequence. dN/dS values were
averaged and then comparisons were drawn between the
gene pairs and their different regions.
Gene Expression Analysis
We used two techniques to look at the relative expression
levels within the gene pairs. For the first, qPCR, we
designed unique primers (available upon request) in
diverged exons. These primers were chosen such that they
did not span an intron-exon boundary and hence would
amplify both cDNA and genomic DNA. Genomic DNA
could then be used as a two copy control in the qPCR reaction. Thus, amplification of genomic DNA could be used
to create a standard curve for both genes, normalizing the
expression of each gene and allowing their ratio of expression to be calculated. Expression analysis was performed
on 10 tissues (brain, smooth muscle, lung, liver, skeletal
muscle, placenta, bone marrow, kidney, fetal brain and
fetal heart).

For the second analysis, pyrosequencing, we designed
primers in exons evolving in concert, in sequences that
share 100% percent identity between the two paralogues.
Thus, these primers would be used to amplify both copies
within the gene pair. Each primer set contained a forward
primer, a reverse biotinylated primer and a sequencing
primer adjacent to a paralogous sequence variant (PSV)
(sequences available upon request). These primers were
designed within a single exon (such that both cDNA and
genomic DNA would be amplified) following the PSQ 96
preparation guide. Pyrosequencing was performed using
the Pyro Gold Enzyme Mixture (Biotage) and analyzed
using PSQ 96MA 2.1 ID System and amplification of
genomic DNA was used to normalize the expression levels
(since PSV peaks in the genomic DNA should be in a 1:1

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/156

ratio). The pyrosequencing analyses were performed on
the same 10 tissues as the qPCR analyses.
