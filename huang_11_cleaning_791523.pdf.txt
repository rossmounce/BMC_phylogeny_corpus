Cleaning up the ‘Bigmessidae’: Molecular
phylogeny of scleractinian corals from Faviidae,
Merulinidae, Pectiniidae and Trachyphylliidae
Danwei Huang1,2*, Wilfredo Y Licuanan3, Andrew H Baird4, Hironobu Fukami5

Abstract
Background: Molecular phylogenetic studies on scleractinian corals have shown that most taxa are not reflective
of their evolutionary histories. Based principally on gross morphology, traditional taxonomy suffers from the lack of
well-defined and homologous characters that can sufficiently describe scleractinian diversity. One of the most
challenging clades recovered by recent analyses is ‘Bigmessidae’, an informal grouping that comprises four
conventional coral families, Faviidae, Merulinidae, Pectiniidae and Trachyphylliidae, interspersed among one another
with no apparent systematic pattern. There is an urgent need for taxonomic revisions in this clade, but it is vital to
first establish phylogenetic relationships within the group. In this study, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of
‘Bigmessidae’ based on five DNA sequence markers gathered from 76 of the 132 currently recognized species
collected from five reef regions in the central Indo-Pacific and the Atlantic.
Results: We present a robust molecular phylogeny of ‘Bigmessidae’ based on the combined five-gene data,
achieving a higher degree of resolution compared to previous analyses. Two Pacific species presumed to be in
‘Bigmessidae’ are more closely related to outgroup clades, suggesting that other unsampled taxa have unforeseen
affinities. As expected, nested within ‘Bigmessidae’ are four conventional families as listed above, and relationships
among them generally corroborate previous molecular analyses. Our more resolved phylogeny supports a close
association of Hydnophora (Merulinidae) with Favites + Montastraea (Faviidae), rather than with the rest of
Merulinidae, i.e., Merulina and Scapophyllia. Montastraea annularis, the only Atlantic ‘Bigmessidae’ is sister to
Cyphastrea, a grouping that can be reconciled by their septothecal walls, a microstructural feature of the skeleton
determined by recent morphological work. Characters at the subcorallite scale appear to be appropriate
synapomorphies for other subclades, which cannot be explained using macromorphology. Indeed, wide
geographic sampling here has revealed more instances of possible cryptic taxa confused by evolutionary
convergence of gross coral morphology.
Conclusions: Numerous examples of cryptic taxa determined in this study support the assertion that diversity
estimates of scleractinian corals are erroneous. Fortunately, the recovery of most ‘Bigmessidae’ genera with only
minor degrees of paraphyly offers some hope for impending taxonomic amendments. Subclades are well defined
and supported by subcorallite morphological features, providing a robust framework for further systematic work.

Background
For the last two decades, coral systematists have been
untangling the complex evolutionary relationships
among scleractinian species using DNA sequence data.

Palumbi [1,2] divided the Scleractinia into two major
clades, the robust and complex groups, and indicated
many problems with traditional taxonomy based on
morphology (see also [3]). For instance, Leptastrea was
recovered within a Fungiina clade rather than the suborder Faviina, where morphological studies had placed it
(e.g., [4,5]). Gradually, using more genetic loci, further
evidence was uncovered to show that non-monophyly of
coral taxa is widespread in Scleractinia (e.g., [6-11]).

This culminated in a comprehensive survey of the entire
taxon by Fukami et al. [12], which showed that while
Scleractinia is monophyletic, most taxonomic groups
within it are not. In fact, a staggering 11 of 16 conventional families are polyphyletic.
Undoubtedly, one of the most challenging clades that
have been recovered by recent analyses is a group of
robust corals in clade XVII [12]. The disarray within the
clade is epitomized by its informal name ‘Bigmessidae’
[13,14]. This clade contains species from four traditional
coral families, Faviidae, Merulinidae, Pectiniidae and
Trachyphylliidae, interspersed among one another in the
tree based on mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I
(COI) and cytochrome b gene sequences [12]. With the
exception of the Montastraea annularis complex, all
members of this clade are from the Indo-Pacific.
Families with all species included within clade XVII are
Trachyphylliidae (monospecific) and Merulinidae, the
latter being polyphyletic, while Faviidae and Pectiniidae
have representatives present within and outside clade
XVII. Although the clade has not been examined in
detail, Huang et al. [15] showed that representatives
from other families (Merulinidae and Mussidae) are also
nested within it, and several genera are not monophyletic (i.e., Echinopora, Favia, Favites, Goniastrea and
Montastraea). In addition, Fukami et al. [12] found
para- or polyphyly in Leptoria, Oulophyllia and Platygyra for at least one marker.
Clearly, there exists an urgent need for taxonomic revisions in this clade, amidst the ongoing disarray in the
Scleractinia. But in order to begin any form of revision
for clade XVII, it is first necessary to determine which
subclades are problematic, using as complete a morphological and genetic coverage as possible. Up to this point,
the largest number of markers used for analysis of this
group has been derived from Fukami et al. [12], who
used the aforementioned mitochondrial genes, as well as
the nuclear b-tubulin and 28S rDNA separately. However, only 33 species represented by 38 terminals were
analyzed for clade XVII, and several subclades were not
resolved due to their short branches. Resolution was
improved in Huang et al. [15], which included 85 terminals from 43 species, but that study used only COI and a
noncoding intergenic mitochondrial region (IGR).
In this study, we present data for five molecular markers—two mitochondrial and three nuclear loci—from
76 of the 132 currently recognized species in clade XVII
[12]. We also included seven species from other robust
corals as outgroups. Corals were sequenced from five
reef regions—the central and northern Great Barrier
Reef in Australia, Wakayama in Japan, Batangas in the
Philippines, Singapore and the Caribbean. We reconstruct the evolutionary history of clade XVII and identify
subclade placement of species that have not been

studied in a molecular phylogenetic context. As some
species were sampled from multiple locations, we also
test if these corals were as widespread as previously
recorded.

Methods
Specimen collection and DNA extraction

Specimens were collected from coral reefs in five
regions—Singapore, Wakayama (Japan), Queensland
(Australia), Batangas (The Philippines), and the Caribbean. To ensure consistency in identifications among
localities, each coral was sampled by at least two
authors, based on morphological features that can be
recognized in the field. The identity was later confirmed
in the laboratory after examining skeletal traits
[5,16-21]. In total, 124 specimens from 83 species in
clades XIV-XXI have been included in the present analysis (Table 1; see Additional file 1). We photographed
each colony in the field and collected between 10 and
100 cm2 of coral from each colony using a hammer and
chisel, with ~2cm2 of tissue preserved in 100% ethanol.
For each colony from Singapore, Japan and the Caribbean, DNA was extracted from ~2 cm2 of tissue digested
in twice their volume of CHAOS solution (not an acronym; 4 M guanidine thiocyanate, 0.1% N-lauroyl sarcosine
sodium, 10 mM Tris pH 8, 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol)
for at least three days at room temperature before
DNA extraction using a phenol-chloroform based
method with a phenol extraction buffer (100 mM
TrisCl pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS) [15,22-24]. For
specimens from Australia and the Philippines, genomic
DNA was extracted from the tissues preserved in ethanol using the Qiagen DNeasy kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions.
The rest of the colony was sprayed with a powerful
water jet to remove as much tissue as possible before
being bleached in 5-10% sodium hypochlorite solution.
The skeletons were rinsed in fresh water, dried, and
deposited in the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity
Research (Singapore), Seto Marine Biological Laboratory
(Wakayama, Japan), Museum of Tropical Queensland
(Australia), and De La Salle University (Manila, The Philippines) (Table 1).
PCR amplification and sequencing

A total of five molecular markers were amplified for a
majority of the samples (Tables 1 and 2). They consist
of three nuclear and two mitochondrial loci: (1) 28S
rDNA D1 and D2 fragments; (2) histone H3; (3) internal
transcribed spacers 1 and 2, including 5.8S rDNA (ITS
in short); (4) cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI); and
(5) noncoding intergenic region situated between COI
and the formylmethionine transfer RNA gene (IGR in
short) [8,23,25-27].

Unless indicated by roman numerals and/or family names in parentheses, all species belong to clade XVII and Faviidae, respectively. Species placed in a
molecular phylogenetic context for the first time are in bold. Specimens with voucher numbers starting with ‘G’ are from Great Barrier Reef (Australia), ‘S’ from
Singapore, ‘J’ from Japan, ‘P’ from the Philippines, and ‘A’ from the Atlantic. GenBank accession numbers are displayed for each molecular marker.

The mitochondrial intergenic region (IGR) was too
variable to be aligned across the entire clade, so only
alignable sequences were included in the analysis. ITS
comprises multiple copies in the nuclear genome, but
the primers we used have shown high fidelity for a single copy, precluding the need to clone the amplicons
[27-33]. Nevertheless, in the unlikely case that paralogs
were sequenced, our analyses could be confused by
incomplete lineage sorting [7]. We therefore sequenced
the ITS locus from at most one representative of each
species, unless analyses of the other four markers did
not recover its sequences as a clade. In the latter case,
sequences may actually belong to separate cryptic species that have been obscured by gross morphological
similarities. For COI, not all specimens of each species

were necessarily sequenced since intraspecific variation
of this gene is limited [15,24].
PCR products were purified with ExoSAP-IT (GE
Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and sequencing was performed by Advanced Studies in Genomics, Proteomics
and Bioinformatics (ASGPB) at the University of Hawaii
at Manoa using the Applied Biosystems BigDye Terminator kit and an ABI 3730XL sequencer. New sequences
were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers
HQ203246-HQ203689 (Table 1).
Phylogenetic analyses

Sequences were organized into five separate data
matrices using Mesquite 2.72 [34], and each aligned
with the accurate alignment option (E-INS-i) in MAFFT

6.7 [35-37] under default parameters. Substitution
saturation of protein-coding genes was assessed via
DAMBE [38,39], where we found histone H3 and COI
to be unsaturated at the third codon positions for tree
inference. Consequently, we concatenated the five gene
matrices into a single partitioned matrix consisting of
4600 characters, 1467 of which were parsimony informative. This was analyzed using maximum parsimony,
Bayesian likelihood, and maximum likelihood methods.
We also carried out these analyses on a four-gene dataset omitting the ITS partition to determine if the phylogenetic reconstruction was sensitive to the ITS sampling
strategy.
Under a maximum parsimony framework, we utilized
new search technologies [40,41] in the software TNT
1.1 [42,43]. Tree searches consisted of 50000 random
addition sequence replicates under the default sectorial,
ratchet, drift and tree fusing parameters. Gaps were
treated as missing data and clade stability was inferred
using 1000 bootstrap replicates each employing 100 random addition sequences.
For maximum likelihood, neighbor-joining and Bayesian
analyses, we determined the most suitable model of
molecular evolution for each gene partition and the concatenated matrix using jModelTest 0.1.1 [44,45] to test
for a total of 24 models, following the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The maximum likelihood tree for
each partition and the combined dataset was inferred
using RAxML 7.2.3 [46,47] at the Cyberinfrastructure for
Phylogenetic Research (CIPRES; http://www.phylo.org),
employing the GTRGAMMA model. The proportion of
invariable sites and gamma distribution shape parameter
for variable sites were estimated during the maximum
likelihood analysis. Multiparametric bootstrap analysis
was carried out using 1000 bootstrap replicates. Maximum likelihood analysis was also carried out with
PhyML 3.0 [45] on the combined data, utilizing the AICchosen model (GTR+I+Γ), and generating 1000 bootstrap
replicates. The neighbor-joining tree of the combined
data was calculated in PAUP*4.0b10 [48] with 1000 bootstrap replicates, employing the evolutionary model
selected above.
Bayesian inference was carried out in MrBayes 3.1.2
[49,50], using the resources of the Computational Biology Service Unit from Cornell University, with each partition modeled (Table 2) but unlinked for separate
parameter estimations. Four Markov chains of 10 million generations were implemented in twelve runs, saving a tree every 100th generation. MCMC convergence
among the runs was monitored using Tracer 1.5 [51],
where we ascertained that only four of the twelve runs
converged on the shortest trees (only two runs converged for the four-gene analysis; see [52-54]), and the
first 40001 trees were to be discarded as burn-in.

Additionally, compensatory base changes because of
the secondary structure of the ITS rDNA loci may lead
to non-independence and increased homoplasy of characters [55-57]. Hence, analysis of the secondary structure of this region may result in a more rigorous
phylogeny [58-61]. Using the ITS2 segment of each ITS
sequence, secondary structure was predicted by searching the ITS2 database [62] for the best match template
and then modeling its structure based on free energy
minimization. The ITS2 sequences and their associated
structural information were aligned using 4SALE 1.5
[63,64], and then exported for analysis in ProfDistS 0.9.8
[65-68]. The profile neighbor-joining algorithm was executed with 10000 bootstrap replicates on the RNA
structural alignment, using the GTR model and rate
matrix ‘Q_ITS2.txt’ for distance correction. ITS2 could
not be amplified from Hydnophora microconos, H. pilosa
and Merulina scabricula. Consequently these species
were excluded from the analysis.

Results and Discussion
In this study, the evolutionary history of the ‘Bigmessidae’
corals was robustly reconstructed using five genes. Relations among other clade representatives chosen as outgroups were also inferred. The maximum likelihood
reconstructions carried out by RAxML 7.2.3 and PhyML
3.0 had log likelihood values of -36224.67 and -36995.48,
respectively. As they were identical when considering
nodes with bootstrap values ≥50, we present the RAxML
tree that garnered a higher likelihood score (Figures 1
and 2). A total of 182 most parsimonious trees (tree
length = 6178) were obtained. No conflicts between tree
optimization procedures (including Bayesian inference
and the neighbor-joining algorithm) were apparent when
considering only the supported nodes (bootstrap ≥50 and
posterior probability ≥0.9) (see Additional file 2). Analyses excluding the ITS partition also gave congruent
results. Several clades were consistent and well supported
among maximum likelihood, parsimony and Bayesian
inferences. We named some of these groups within clade
XVII from A to I, consistent with the classification in
Budd and Stolarski [69]. On the other hand, the neighbor-joining method generated a relatively unresolved
tree—subclades A, C, F and I did not achieve bootstrap
values of ≥50 (see Additional file 2).
The combined five-gene data yielded the most
resolved phylogeny hitherto of clade XVII, with
most branches garnering high support values. However,
most partitions gave fairly unresolved trees when analyzed individually (see Additional file 3). By examining
the support of subclades among trees obtained via different partitions, we found that nuclear markers contributed a greater extent to the final tree topology (Table 3).
Histone H3, for instance, supported all higher-level

groupings and all subclades except D/E (Figure 1). The
28S and ITS rDNA gene trees had moderate resolution
within clade XVII, with only two unresolved subclades
each. Surprisingly, the tree based on ITS2 rDNA secondary structure had less resolution than the primary
sequence alignment. Indeed, the former has demonstrated potential for resolving intrageneric phylogenies
in other anthozoans [70,71], but it is less informative for
relationships at higher taxonomic levels [72,73]. Evidently, the COI tree was poorly resolved, with ≥50 bootstrap support for few relationships among major clades
and only one subclade. The slow evolution of the mitochondrial COI gene among anthozoans is certainly the
reason behind this [24,74,75]. While the intergenic marker (IGR) adjacent to COI on the mitochondrial genome

has shown promise for phylogenetic reconstruction
among Faviidae and Mussidae [15,23,76], it cannot be
unambiguously aligned between the major clades. We
urge the development of more nuclear phylogenetic
markers that can be reliably applied across diverse scleractinian clades.
Most relationships among clades XV to XXI obtained in
this study corroborate results of Fukami et al. [12]
(Figure 1). The only difference occurs in the sister
grouping of Diploastrea heliopora (XV) and Montastraea cavernosa (XVI) (supported by all analyses except
Bayesian likelihood) that form a grade in Fukami et al.
[12]. The monophyly of the clade XVII+XIX+XX (Pacific faviids and mussids) is recovered but not well supported. Montastraea multipunctata and Moseleya

latistellata are Pacific faviids, and therefore presumably
in clade XVII. But as a result of superficial similarities,
they have historically been associated with the Pacific
mussids Blastomussa merleti (clade XIV) [77] and
Acanthastrea hillae (clade XVIII) [5,18], respectively.
Here, we find them to be more closely related to clades
XIX and XX instead, revealing a taxonomic situation more
challenging than anticipated. Pacific faviids other than
Diploastrea heliopora can no longer be restricted to clade
XVII, and the possibility exists that yet-to-be sampled taxa
provisionally placed in clade XVII—particularly the monotypic genera, Australogyra, Erythrastrea, Boninastrea and
Paraclavarina—have unexpected affinities.
Nested within clade XVII are four conventional
families—Faviidae, Merulinidae, Pectiniidae and Trachyphylliidae (Figure 1). Two Pectiniidae genera, Pectinia
and Mycedium (XVII-E) form the sister clade to Oulophyllia. This is a similar relationship to the results of

Fukami et al. [12], although here we also show with reasonable support that Oulophyllia is monophyletic, and
Caulastraea is an outgroup rather than nested within
Oulophyllia (XVII-D). Merulinidae is represented by
Hydnophora, Merulina and Scapophyllia. Hydnophora is
more closely related to Favites and Pacific Montastraea
spp. than Merulina and Scapophyllia, which form a
grade within the clade dominated by Goniastrea. The
monospecific Trachyphylliidae is nested within the clade
consisting primarily of Favia spp., and is sister to Favia
lizardensis and F. truncatus (Figure 2). Work is ongoing
to redescribe clade XVII by incorporating the above
families and applying a new taxon name since the type
species of Faviidae, Favia fragum (Esper, 1797), belongs
to clade XXI [12].
The genetic affiliation of Hydnophora and Trachyphyllia with Faviidae has previously been proposed by
Fukami et al. [8,12]. However, this is not exclusively a

molecular hypothesis. Based on a combination of colony,
corallite and subcorallite characters (e.g., polyp budding;
wall, septal and columellar structures), Vaughan and
Wells, 1943 [78], placed the two taxa within Faviidae.
But later, Chevalier, 1975 [79], attempted to distinguish
Trachyphyllia from Faviidae based on minor differences
in wall and septal structures by elevating it to the rank
of family. Correspondingly, Veron, 1985 [17], moved
Hydnophora into Merulinidae because of Hydnophora
species’ macromorphological similarities (i.e., colony
growth form and polyp structure) with Merulina
ampliata and Scapophyllia cylindrica, which are genetically in the same lineage (subclade A) as several Goniastrea spp. and Favia stelligera (Figures 1 and 2; see also
[8,12]).
Montastraea annularis and likely other members of
the species complex (M. faveolata and M. franksi) are
the only Atlantic species in clade XVII (see also [8,12]).
Most significantly here, M. annularis is sister to Cyphastrea, forming clade XVII-C (Figure 1). This placement
may seem bizarre in the context of traditional macromorphological characters used to classify scleractinians
(e.g., [4,78]). However, recent work at the microstructural scale (centers of rapid accretion and thickening
deposits) has suggested that their septothecal walls
(formed by fusion of outer margins of septa) may unite
the two taxa [69] (see also [80]). These subcorallite features appear to be appropriate synapomorphies for
other subclades. For instance, clade XVII-A consists of
Merulina, Scapophyllia, Goniastrea A and Favia stelligera (Figure 2). At the corallite level, these corals cannot
be reconciled within the same taxon, since Favia

stelligera corallites have single centers with separate
walls (plocoid), Goniastrea spp. have fused walls (cerioid) and may form valleys (meandroid), while Merulina
and Scapophyllia are composed predominantly of elongated valleys (see Additional file 1). On the other hand,
they share the apomorphy of having septothecal walls
with abortive septa (thin bands between normal septa
with their own centers of rapid accretion).
The use of macromorphology for identifying ‘Bigmessidae’ species is known for being problematic as most of
these characters are homoplasious [15,80,81]. The ability
to distinguish clades based on microstructural features
is encouraging for scleractinian systematics. Micromorphology, at the scale of septal teeth and granules, has
also exhibited promise as phylogenetic characters
[25,80,82-85]. Interestingly, in light of recent molecular
hypotheses, other biological traits, in particular, sexuality
and to a lesser extent, breeding mode appear highly
conserved and could be further developed as phylogenetic markers [86,87].
Prior to the use of molecular data to build evolutionary trees, it was a great challenge to determine which
morphological characters could be useful for classification, given their intraspecific variability [32,88] and phenotypic plasticity [89-94]. Indeed, the general anthozoan
body plan is relatively simple, and scleractinians in particular have few discrete morphological characters that
are known to be phylogenetically informative at the
polyp level [4,95-97]. As a result of the recent disarray
in coral systematics, morphological taxonomies of scleractinians have been heavily criticized (e.g., [8,12,98,99]).
Molecular characters, which are much more numerous

Huang et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:37
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/37

and arguably neutrally evolving, can certainly aid our
understanding of evolutionary relationships. However,
morphological evidence supporting various molecular
clades in the present analysis suggests that morphology
at novel scales will play an essential role in the taxonomy of ‘Bigmessidae’ [80].
Widespread sampling in this study has shown that
corals thought to belong to the same species across the
central Indo-Pacific are actually from distinct lineages.
Consider Goniastrea australensis (Milne Edwards and
Haime, 1857), which occurs in two clades (Figures 1
and 2; see also Additional file 1). Since this species was
first described from Australia, the Australian specimen
that clustered with Favites russelli and Montastraea
curta should be considered G. australensis, while the
two specimens from Singapore (S088 and S098, subclade
A) probably represent new species yet to be described.
This is certainly not an isolated case. A similar situation
is revealed for Montastraea valenciennesi. Specimens
from Australia (G61904) and Singapore (S006 and S008)
are in subclade B of mostly Favia spp., while the representative from the Philippines (P102) is in subclade F, a
distant clade comprising mainly Favites species. Interestingly, two reproductively isolated morphotypes of M.
valenciennesi were recently found to co-occur in
Wakayama (Japan), distinguished by the degree of wall
fusion among corallites [100]. Chevalier, 1971 [101],
upon examination of the holotype, placed the species in
Favia on the basis of corallites possessing separate walls
and budding intratentacularly (see also [102-108]). This
suggests that the name Favia valenciennesi (Milne
Edwards and Haime, 1848) could be applied to the Australian and Singaporean specimens in subclade B, while
P102 (subclade F) is a new species.
Less extensive issues occur among Goniastrea and
Favia species. For instance, G. pectinata (subclade A),
collected from three locations, is clearly paraphyletic,
with G. australensis and G. favulus nested within them
(Figure 2). For Favia (subclade B), of six F. favus specimens collected from three localities, only three of these
form a supported clade while the rest are dispersed
within clade XVII-B with no apparent biogeographical
pattern. The nesting of Barabattoia amicorum among
Favia spp. has been consistently recovered in recent
molecular phylogenies [12,15], but this affinity was in
fact the dominant hypothesis [5,107-109] until Veron,
1986 [18], included the species in its current genus.
Conversely, Favia rotundata clusters with Favites spp.
rather than its congeners, but it was indeed originally
described as Favites rotundata Veron, Pichon and Wijsman-Best, 1977 [5] (see also [109,110]).
The polyphyly of most ‘Bigmessidae’ genera seems to
confer a bleak outlook for revisionary work. However,
as we have shown in Figure 1, several genera can be

Page 10 of 13

clearly grouped as clades with limited name changes.
For instance, subclade F is composed of species from
Favites Link, 1807, Montastraea de Blainville, 1830, and
Favia Ehrenberg, 1834 (Figure 2). While the remaining
Favites spp. (i.e., F. pentagona, F. russelli, and F. stylifera)
are not included within this subclade, the type species of
this genus is Favites abdita (Ellis and Solander, 1786, type
locality ‘Probablement les mers des Grandes-Indes’,
Lamarck, 1816 [111]). The representative of the latter we
used falls well within subclade F. Since no other type
species were recovered and with Favites Link, 1807,
being the oldest valid genus in the subclade, Favites
should be expanded to include the other species, while
F. pentagona, F. russelli and F. stylifera will have to be
subsumed within other genera. Several other multispecies genera in fact appear stable: Caulastraea,
Cyphastrea, Echinopora, Hydnophora, Leptoria, Merulina and Oulophyllia. Name changes are certainly not
necessary for Favites and Platygyra, since they host
their respective type species in the subclades shown in
Figure 2.

Conclusions
Numerous instances of cryptic taxa determined in this
study support the assertion that coral diversity estimates have been fraught with errors [8]. Traits relating
to the gross skeletal morphology of corals are unreliable for species description and identification because
of their potential for intraspecific variability [32,88]
and environment-induced plasticity [89-94]. Yet, these
characters have served as the foundation for scleractinian taxonomy (e.g., [4,5]). Fortunately, using molecular data, the recovery of most genera within the
‘Bigmessidae’ with only minor degrees of paraphyly
spells hope for impending taxonomic amendments.
Our results show that most genera only require slight
revisions, and most major changes are necessary only
at the level of the major clades described in Fukami
et al. [12]. Certainly, broad taxonomic sampling within
Faviidae has revealed more species with unexpected
affinities, such as Moseleya latistellata and Montastraea multipunctata. Clade XVII may consequently
have to be redefined to exclude them.
Nevertheless, ‘Bigmessidae’ subclades are well defined
and will no doubt provide a robust framework for taxonomic revisions. The fact that microstructural features
support ‘Bigmessidae’ subclades also offers hope for the
morphological approach. Evolutionary relationships
among subclades are still provisional due to insufficient
statistical support, but they can be clarified with further
sampling of nuclear sequences. Eventually, a wellresolved tree of a redescribed clade XVII will be
available to reconstruct the morphological evolution of
‘Bigmessidae’ at various scales.
