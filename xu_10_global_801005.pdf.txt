Abstract
Background: Many essential cellular processes, such as cellular metabolism, transport, cellular metabolism and
most regulatory mechanisms, rely on physical interactions between proteins. Genome-wide protein interactome
networks of yeast, human and several other animal organisms have already been established, but this kind of
network reminds to be established in the field of plant.
Results: We first predicted the protein protein interaction in Arabidopsis thaliana with methods, including ortholog,
SSBP, gene fusion, gene neighbor, phylogenetic profile, coexpression, protein domain, and used Naïve Bayesian
approach next to integrate the results of these methods and text mining data to build a genome-wide protein
interactome network. Furthermore, we adopted the data of GO enrichment analysis, pathway, published literature
to validate our network, the confirmation of our network shows the feasibility of using our network to predict
protein function and other usage.
Conclusions: Our interactome is a comprehensive genome-wide network in the organism plant Arabidopsis
thaliana, and provides a rich resource for researchers in related field to study the protein function, molecular
interaction and potential mechanism under different conditions.

Background
A protein in an organism does not fulfill its function
independently. The complicated cellular functions of an
organism frequently rely on physical interactions
between proteins. Over the past decade, various new
experimental methods have been developed to quantify
the interaction between proteins. Some of them, like
AFM, FRET and BREF, can only be applied on the small
scale protein-protein interaction detection, while others,
such as Yeast Two Hybrid, Affinity Purification and Protein Arrays, are suitable for high throughput purpose.

High throughput technologies, like yeast two-hybrid system (Y2H) and affinity purification, have been applied
for genome-wide detection of protein protein intearction
in several species, including Homo Sapiens[1-4], Drosophila Melanogaster[5,6], Saccharomyces Cerevisiae,[7-9]
and Caenorhabditis elegans[10].
In Homo Sapien, Wanker and his colleagues have constructed the protein-protein interaction network with
3186 protein pairs containing 1705 proteins, while Vidal
et. al. have built a protein-protein interaction network
with the same platform. However, only a few small overlapping pairs are detected between the two protein
interaction datasets. Same phenomenon also is observed
during the process of building protein protein interaction network in Drosophila Melanogaster. Giot et al
have built an interactome of Drosophila Melanogaster
containing 4,679 interactions between 4,780 proteins.
Later on, another group reported a protein interaction

map with 2338 interactions between 1727 proteins using
a high-throughput yeast two hybrid system. Surprisingly,
only 24 interactive pairs are overlapped between the two
datasets. The same results emerge in Saccharomyces
Cerevisiae also. Among three different PPI datasets generated by three independent research groups with 4,475,
72,690, and 48,751 PPI pairs, respectively, maximum
overlaps are below 9% between each two interactomes.
The first two interactomes are generated with the same
technology - yeast two hybrid system, and the last one
is done with Affinity Purification-MS method. These
previous independent results show a low consistence
between different research groups. Analyses of the differences in the datasets and methods above indicate that
the high throughput experimental methods have condition-specific and method-specific characteristics, which
result in the little overlap even with the same experiment platform in the same species. Thus each of the
high throughput experiment methods has its bias in
detecting protein-protein interaction and alternative
strategies should be adopted to enhance the accuracy
and comprehensiveness of the genome-wide protein
interaction maps. However, the high-cost, low coverage,
and labor intensive of those experimental methods limit
their applications.
In order to overcome the drawbacks and the limitation of the experimental approaches and expand the
coverage of protein protein interaction network, various
bioinformatics approaches have been developed during
past decade. For example, new bioinformatics methods,
based on the gene expression profile, the evolutionary
relationship and genome contexts, are introduced in the
field of genome-wide protein-protein interaction network construction, those methods include ortholog
[4,11-13], microarray gene expression profiles[4,7,12-15],
gene fusion[15], gene neighbour[15], phylogenetic profile[16], domain[4,12,13] and SSBP[4,12,13]. Up to now,
the interactomes of several model organisms, such as
Homo Sapiens, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, Drosophila
Melanogaster, Caenorhabditis Elegans, Plasmodium Falciparum and Arabidopsis Thaliana, have been already
built on the basis of certain bioinformatics methods.
These available interactomes have been constructed by
combining different high-throughput data with bioinformatics predicted results. For example, the integrated
protein-protein interaction network of Saccharomyces
Cerevisiae was derived through the integration of the
Y2H data, protein complex and microarray gene expression profiles with the Bayesian probability model [7].
The protein interactome of Human was built through
probabilistic integration of the results generated from
protein-protein interactions in several model organisms,
protein domain assignments, gene expression measurements and biological function annotations [4]. The two

Page 2 of 14

protein-protein interaction networks in Arabidopsis
thaliana were constructed based on the data of ortholog
and collected transcriptome data, or shared annotation,
domain interaction, and co-localization [13,17]. The
Plasmodium falciparum protein interactome [15] was
established on the basis of the methods including gene
fusion, phylogenetic profile and gene expression data.
All of the above interactomes except Arabidopsis are
generated with Bayesian integration approach. As different bioinformatics methods predict the protein-protein
interactions based on different types of data, each one
also has its own inherent bias and limited coverage [18].
To systematically integrate those various data and make
the results consistent to increase the prediction coverage
and accuracy, various algorithms ,such as Voting, SVM,
and Bayesian probabilistic model have been adopted for
the purpose. Since Voting just uses a limited partition of
data and SVM needs parameter estimation which might
bring uncertainty into the prediction result, Bayesian
probabilistic model has been widely applied in the integration process of establishing the genome-wide protein-protein interaction networks [4,15,19].
By assembling a collection of genomic, transcriptomic
and proteomic data, we have successfully predicted genome-wide protein-protein interactions in Arabidopsis
thaliana on the basis of model organism protein-protein
interactions, protein domain assignments, Arabidopsis
thaliana gene expression profiles, biological function
annotations, and genomic inference methods. During
the process, we have used carefully constructed high
quality Golden Standard Positive (GSP) data and Golden
Standard Negative (GSN) data to enhance the reliability
of Bayesian probabilistic model and generated the protein-protein interaction network with a larger coverage.
Next, we have carried out functional analysis on the
basis of our Arabidopsis thaliana PPI network. We have
also annotated protein function by using the simulated
annealing method. In addition, we have deposited all
our results and other integrated useful resources into
AtPID [20]. The results of our analysis show the wide
applicability of our network and demonstrate that our
interactome is a valuable resource for biologist in plant
field to investigate the protein function and explore the
potential mechanism of various life processes.

Results
During the process, we first defined a gold standard
positive set (GSP) through text mining from published
literature as well as data collection from IntAct, BIND
and TAIR database. We generated a gold standard negative set (GSN) on the basis of the different sublocation
information from GO. Data integration was mainly fulfilled by measuring individual accuracy in the context of
overlap with the gold standards, and subsequently

Xu et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11(Suppl 2):S2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/S2/S2

assigning them weights or scores according to the number of overlaps. The scores calculated here were then
used to construct the main protein-protein interaction
network of Arabidopsis Thaliana. After the construction
of the network, we validated our network by using data
from KEGG[21,22], AraCyc[23,24] and published
literature.
Gold standard sets

A gold standard positive (GSP) set of 4,129 distinct protein-protein interactions among 5,505 proteins came
from the databases IntAct [25], BIND[26,27], TAIR
[28,29] and text mining (see methods). Such GSP set
was used to score the interaction network and to assign
each predictive interaction pair with quantitative measurements. A gold standard negative set (GSN), within
which each component of a pair has different cellular

Page 3 of 14

sublocation according to the Gene Ontology database,
contains 196,855 protein pairs (see methods). Thirteen
pairs of identical protein-pair, which appeared in both
sets, were removed from both GSP and GSN.
Network construction

We applied ortholog interactomes, expression data,
shared biological function, enriched domain pairs, gene
neighbor, gene fusion and phylogenetic profile combined
with prior odds to predict protein-protein interactions.
By applying Naïve Bayesian approach [30,31], we constructed our protein-protein interaction network in the
following manner (Figure 1).
Since shared biological function represents the consistence of protein function more than real physical interactions and genome context methods (including gene
neighbor, gene fusion and phylogenetic profile) imply

Figure 1 The flowchart of our interactome construction process 1. the LR score of each method is calculated first, we next combined the results
LR of gene neighbor, gene fusion, phylogenetic profile and SSBP together and validated the PPI pair obtained by these four methods with
protein domain method. Only the PPI that is predicted by one of the above four methods and is supported by domain could be integrated in
our interactome. 2. We integrated the result of the newly combined methods with the results of ortholog and gene coexpression. The final LR
score of our PPI network is the product of the LR scores of the three above methods.

Xu et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11(Suppl 2):S2

functional linkage [16], the results of these methods
reflect the functional linkages between the proteins
rather than the true direct physical interaction. We validate the predictive result of these methods with domain
interaction as domain interactions are the fundamental
of function unit for physical interactions between proteins. Thus, only the protein-protein interaction pairs
that are generated by the combination of genome context methods and shared biological function and, at the
same time, are confirmed by inferred domain interaction
are integrated into our network. The likelihood ratio
(LR) of protein-protein interaction pair, based on the
above five methods, is the maximum LR among the different genome context methods and shared biological
function method. Next, we integrated the above results
with Naïve Bayesian algorithm. The final LR of PPI pair
within our network were generated from three parts, the
LR according the above five method, the LR of expression data method and the LR of ortholog interactomes
(See Methods).
After the construction of the network, we categorized
PPI pairs into three groups according to LR score.
Firstly, we applied the generally accepted Bayesian criterion, Opost =1, to define the cutoff of high confident
interactive pairs. Under this condition, the LR is calculated to be 559. There are 2505 interactions concerning
1361proteins in our high confident network. Secondly,
As the interaction predictions based on ortholog are
more reliable, among the LR generated from 4 different
ortholog interactomes, Caenorhabditis elegance has the
lowest LR with the score 92, we used 92 as the cutoff
for the medium confident interactions in our network,
the 16429 interactive pairs with 5363 proteins. Last, the
interaction pairs having the LR score lower than 92 but
being supported by at least one predictive method are
collected in the low confident network. Thus, we use 92
and 559 as the likelihood ratio cutoff and separate our
PPI network in low, middle and high confident groups.
Network function annotation

The simulated annealing algorithm[32] was used to
annotate the function-unknown proteins based on the
concept of guilt-association in both high and medium
confident PPI network. According to the annotation
information in TAIR7, which was the latest edition of
TAIR annotation information when we constructed the
whole PPI network, there were 1,260 function unknown
proteins in our high and medium confident PPI network. Through annotation process, all of these 1,260
proteins were annotated with 1,473 GO terms in
121,369 annotation pairs (each annotation pair is composed of a function unknown protein and its annotated
GO term). 6,686 pairs of annotation had p-value with
high significance (less than 0.0517), which can be

Page 4 of 14

treated as high confident annotation pairs. For example,
protein AT5G02050, predicted as ATP-dependent helicase activity (GO: 0008026) by our method. is consistent
with the TAIR 8 annotation mitochondrial glycoprotein
family protein. The rest of the significant annotations
are provided in additional file 1.
Interaction conservation in other species

In order to verify the interactions in our network, the
orthologs in E.coliK12, S.pombe, and S. cerevisae inferred
from the Arabidopsis proteins in our high and medium
confident networks are extracted from the Inparanoid
database. Next, corresponding protein-protein interaction pairs from the individual organism were built in
accordance with the protein-protein interaction in our
interactome. Since the ortholog information in S. cerevisae was used to construct our PPI network, we first
excluded the predicted PPI in A. thaliana inferred from
the S. cerevisae orthologs in our network; we next reversely mapped the rest protein interaction pairs to S. cerevisae. Then, we search all of the new built pairs in
IntAct databases. In this way, we obtained fifty conservative pairs in S. cerevisae. The result indicates that
many of our predictive protein-protein interaction pairs
are conserved in other organisms. For instance, our predictive interaction pair, AT2G33210 and AT2G39770,
has corresponding interaction pair, NP_418567.1 and
NP_416543.1, in E.coliK12, which has been confirmed
by the pull down experiment [33]. In addition, the conservative protein-protein interaction pairs could also
show biological function relationship between a protein
and large biological complex. For example, the protein
interaction pair YLL036C and YDL030W was deduced
according to our predictive pair AT2G33340 and
AT5G06160. In S. cerevisae, the protein YLL036C
represents the splicing factor associated with the spliceosome and the protein YDL030W is a subunit of the
SF3a splicing factor complex. The interaction pair confirms the interaction between splicing factor and the
related spliceosome complex [34,35]. All of the inferred
interaction pairs in Arabidopsis Thaliana and their corresponding PPI in other species are provided in Additional file 2.
Consistence between pathway information and network

According to the data concerning pathway, we found
that the proteins that participated in more pathways had
the tendency to have a higher degree in our interactome, which is also supported by previous work[36]. We
have used pathway related data of Arabidopsis thaliana
from KEGG and AraCyc to check the consistence
between pathway and our network for the validation of
our interactome. There are totally 299 pathways in
KEGG and AraCyc. Firstly, we counted the number of

Xu et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11(Suppl 2):S2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/S2/S2

Page 5 of 14

the pathways that a protein participates in. Among all
the member proteins of these pathways there were 33
proteins that join in more than 10 pathways (Additional
file 3 table 1) which can be regarded as hubs in the
pathways. After the identification of these proteins, we
located the hub proteins in our whole network, whose
nodes have the average degree 373, comparing with the
average degree 42 of all nodes in the whole network.
Searching the degree of these joint components shows
that the proteins related to more pathways have the tendency to have higher degrees.
Besides, the components of our PPI pairs have the
functional consistence. We collected all the components
in the Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis pathway (ath00010)
from KEGG and used their neighbors in our high and
medium confident network to build an ath00010 related
PPI network. Figure 2 shows us that protein At1G79530
has an interaction with At1G56190. According to the
information from KEGG, the EC code of At1G79530
and At1G56190 are 1.2.1.12 and 2.7.2.3, which represents glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and 3phosphoglycerate kinase, respectively. In the KEGG
pathway ath00010, the two proteins have the same substrate Glycerate-1,3P2. This functional consistence
shows the reliability of our PPI network and PPI
predictions.
Moreover, we have mapped all the pathways to our
high and medium confident network. Almost all the
metabolic pathways (299 pathways) have their key components in our network (Additional file 3). For example,
the protein At2G44350, represents ATP citrate synthase,
has a key function in the pathway Acetyl-CoA biosynthesis from citrate. In our network, the protein has interaction with several proteins to carry out the function,
Those proteins include At1G53240 (malate dehydrogenase (NAD), mitochondrial), At3G28715 (H+-transporting two-sector ATPase, putative), At3G28710 (H
+-transporting two-sector ATPase, putative),
AT3G47520 (Encodes a protein with NAD-dependent
malate dehydrogenase activity), AT3G09810 (isocitrate
dehydrogenase, putative / NAD+ isocitrate dehydrogenase, putative). When mapping the At2G44350 gene to

the orthologs in mouse and S. pombe, which we did not
applied in our predictive process, we found that the
related ortholog protein in both the organisms also
interacted with malate dehydrogenase and other proteins concerning the function of energy metabolism.
These functional consistencies related to mitochondrion
and interactive conservation in energy metabolism
across species could validate the value of our network in
studying metabolic pathways or related function modules. Moreover, we have tried to extend the pathway
with the help of our interactome. For example, the protein AT1G48790, which is annotated as ubiquitindependent protein, is not the component in the aerobic
respiration alternative oxidase pathway. But in our network, AT1G48790 has interaction with AT1G16700
which is one of the components of the pathway represents NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone). In addition,
AT1G48790 involves in the pathways such as NADH
phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, oxidative phosphorylation, and aerobic respiration. it makes us suppose that the aerobic respiration alternative oxidase
pathway might interact with other biological components or above pathways by means of the interaction
between AT1G48790 and AT1G16700.
Interaction between transcription factors

Cooperative transcriptional activations among transcription factors (TFs) are important to understand the
mechanisms of complex transcriptional regulations in
organisms. We used our protein-protein interaction data
to infer the possible interaction between transcription
factors. For example, we found interaction between
AT1G56650, that involves in abscisic acid (ABA) signal
transduction, and AT2G40220, that response to abscisic
acid stimulus. Both of the TFs could be the downstream
components of the ABA signaling pathway that participate into the regulation of target genes response to ABA
signal. Therefore, these interactions between transcription factors may exposit certain regulatory mechanism
of the transcription factors in the biological processes.
Researchers could refer to AtPID to check the interaction partner of their interested transcription factors.
All our predicted PPI pair and the whole network is
stored in Arabidopsis thaliana Protein Interactome
Database(AtPID)[20], which is available at http://www.
megabionet.org/atpid/. One can explore our interactome
with the help of AtPID.

Discussion
The characteristics of our interactome

Because of the importance of protein-protein interaction,
an interactome will be an invaluable resource for studying
the protein functions, sublocations and protein protein
interactions, and inferring the potential mechanisms of

biology processes. Currently, two predictive interactomes
of Arabidopsis thaliana are publically available. One of the
interactomes is mainly based on the method of ortholog
data combined with gene co-expression relationship, that
contains 7,072 high and medium confidence proteinprotein interaction pairs between 1,650 proteins [13],
while another one is on the basis of gene expression,
domain interaction, shared annotation, and co-localization
including 224,206 potential interactions concerning 9,221
proteins[17]. Since each of the predictive methods has its
own bias and coverage [18], the resulted datasets have just
reflected certain aspects of the genome-wide protein protein interactions in Arabidopsis thaliana. Therefore, we
constructed our interactome in a more comprehensive
way by integrating the information concerning ortholog,
coexpression, genome context, functional annotation, and
protein domains with Bayes probabilistic approach. The
number of the overlapped interactive pairs is 3,054, involving 1,444 proteins, between our high and medium confident interactome and Lee’s interactome. In contrast, our
high and medium confident interactome only contained
the same 791 consistent interactions between 635 proteins
as Chen’s interactome. Similarly, the overlap between the
previous two networks is just 338 interactions concerning
335 proteins. The differences between the datasets could
result from the criterion used by different groups. Our
domain based interactions came from two different
approaches, one part of the interactions were constructed
according to the directly domain interaction that were
experiment validated, meanwhile, another part of the
interactions were inferred from domain interaction based
on the experimental confirmed protein interaction data. In
contrast, the domain features in Chen’s methods were
based on seven predictive methods come from Pfam system, thus the domain interaction criterion adapted in our
methods is more stringent. Moreover, Lee’s and our group
has adopted similar methods such as ortholog etc, that
could contribute to higher overlapped interactive pairs
between the two resulted interactomes. However, Lee’s
group just uses ortholog to construct the interactome and
the coverage of their interactome is much low than ours.
Besides, during their analysis process, they simply evaluate
the goodness and stability of a protein-protein interaction
with a CV value without applying any powerful statistical
integrative method. The differences among the three interactomes denote that each of the three datasets could be
complementary to the others. In addition, more various
methods could be applied in the field of protein protein
interaction predictions to generate more comprehensive
interactiome.
The biological exploration of the whole network

The result of GO Enrichment Analysis shows the relative consistence between our network topology and

Page 7 of 14

biological ontology. We have used GO enrichment[37]
to explore our large scale PPI network. The protein
lists which are specially expressed in flower, leave,
root, seed and silique[12] were extracted to do GO
Enrichment Analysis with Amigo[37] first, and the
result showed that these proteins were enriched in 48
GO terms. Next, we searched the neighbor of these
tissue specific expressed proteins in our whole network. Then, we carried out the GO enrichment analysis on these neighbor proteins. Subsequently, we
compared the results generated by the above two runs
of GO Enrichment Analysis. The results show that
direct biological relationships exist between the tissue
specific proteins and their interaction partners in our
interactome. The tissue specific proteins are enriched
in many GO terms, one of which is GO: 0005739.
This GO term lies in the eighth hierarchy of the GO
hierarchical structure and its description is mitochondrion. The first level neighbors of proteins enriched
in GO: 0005739 were also closely correlated in the
same GO term (GO: 0005739) according to GOenrichment analysis, with the descriptions such as
purine ribonucleotide biosynthetic process, purine
nucleotide metabolic process, ribonucleotide metabolic process and ATP biosynthetic process (Table 2).
ATP is biosynthesized in mitochondrion and the A in
ATP represents adenine that is a purine base. We performed similar analyses on the rest 47 GO terms, 26
of them showed direct biological relations (additional
file 4). The direct biological consistence resulted from
the GO enrichment analyses implied the biological
reliability of our PPI network. With the consistence of
the biological ontology, our interactome could be
used to further elucidate the molecular aspects of proteome in Arabidopsis thaliana including the function
annotation of unknown protein, sublocalization prediction of a certain protein, molecular experiment
guidance.

Functional unit in the interactome

The existence of interaction between two proteins suggests that they contribute to the same or similar biological processes. Many cellular processes and chemical
events in organisms such as enzymatic reactions and
dimerization involve protein-protein interactions, and
function related proteins tend to form a function unit to
carry out the specific biological process. We can unravel
the complex interaction network to identify those function units and the potential new components in them
with our interaction network.
Spliceosome are composed of snRNA, snRNP, splicing
factors and other miscellaneous proteins. The interactions between these distinct proteins fulfill the function
of removing introns from a transcribed pre-mRNA
sequence. We did further exploration in our high and
medium network. Firstly, we collected the proteins that
are annotated as splicing factors, we next acquired their
interaction partners and selected those proteins interacting with more than one protein annotated as splicing factor. In this way, we obtained a splicing functional unit
containing 52 pairs PPI between 54 proteins. 80, 18, and
3 of these PPI pairs are conserved in yeast, human and
Drosophila, respectively. For example, the interactive pair
of AT3G55200 and AT1G07170 in our interactome has
corresponding orthlog pairs of YML049C-YPR094W in
yeast and ENSP00000305790- ENSP00000216252 in
human. YML049C is annotated as a protein involved in
pre-mRNA splicing; component of the pre-spliceosome,
while YPR094W is annotated as a zinc cluster protein
involving in pre-mRNA splicing and cycloheximide resistance. In addition, ENSP00000305790 is annotated as
splicing factor 3B subunit 3 and ENSP00000216252 is
annotated as splicing factor 3B-associated 14 kDa protein. All of these proteins commit the splicing activities.
Thus, for the protein AT1G07170 annotated as a cellular
component unknown protein in TAIR system, we can
assign it to the splicing functional unit and it should have
the biological function concerning splicing activities in
Arabidopsis thaliana. Furthermore, among these PPI
pairs, four of them are the interactions between 8 different splicing factor proteins. Moreover, 31 proteins that
are not annotated as a splicing factor have interactions
with at least two other splicing factors. Among these
31 proteins, eleven proteins, like AT2G18740, and
AT3G53570, are annotated as small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, which are the components of spliceosome.
These consistencies not only validate the composition of
the spliceosome but also reflect the biological applications of our interactome. In the functional unit, other
proteins that do not have direct relationships with spliceosome may correspond to the other miscellaneous proteins in spliceosome complex, these proteins could be
used to infer the potential functions of the splicing

factors in other biological processes. Therefore, our interactome offers value clues to explore the new functions
for proteins and the potential mechanisms in the different biological conditions.
Literature validation

Up to now, several published papers have studied the
function modules or metabolic processes based on
experimental generated PPI sets. Wurtele ES and his
colleagues have articulated several core metabolic processes in Arabidopsis. We collected the proteins in fatty
acid biosynthesis and leucine degradation pathways and
searched their first level neighbors in our high and medium confident network to extract the PPI subnetwork
out (Figure 3 A, B). Several separate modules of PPI
related to certain metabolic process were detected during the process in our network and are consistence with
the protein groups contained in their pathways (Figure 3
C,D)[38]. It is found that the components of our PPI
module are all assembled together in the metabolic process and almost have the same function validated by
their research results. Furthermore, in their result
(where the result comes from?), six genes have been
detected highly correlated with the gene At4g34030
(Table 3). Three of them were also predicted in our low
confident PPI network, but only one (At1g03090) was
detected in the medium confident network. This result,
to certain extent, indicates that the accuracy of PPI prediction is enhanced while the confidence of our PPI network increases.
Furthermore, we carried out text mining for those
newly published papers after our prediction was finished, eighty newly biological experiment validated PPI
pairs was collected. Forty-eight of them can be converted to AGI code and mapped to our PPI network,
thirty-four and six of them can be found in our medium
and high confident PPI network, respectively (See additional file 5). The number of PPI pairs newly confirmed
by other groups existed in both of our medium and
high confident PPI network indicate the accuracy of our
PPI prediction. Considering the coverage of medium
confident interactome, we suggest researchers, who are
interested our dataset, to pay more attention to our
medium confident PPI network.
Protein function prediction

The network view of the interactive proteins can be
used to infer the potential new relationships between
proteins. The basic underlying assumption of the functional annotation is that pairwise interaction is a strong
indication for common function. Therefore, the PPI network offers a new resource for protein function study.
We have used the dataset to annotate the unknown protein functions based on the theory of ‘guilty by

association’ [15,16]. In our medium confident network,
the protein At5g50850, which is annotated as pyruvate
dehydrogenase, has an interaction with At1g54220,
which is annotated as putative dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase (Figure 4). As dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase is generally accepted as the E2 component of
pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, it is further suggested
that the protein At1g54220 have the function of dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase based on our data.
Since the protein At5g50850 has been annotated with
E.C 1.2.4.1 and has an action on 6-S-Acetyl-dihydrolipoamide in the pathway ath00010 graph from KEGG,
the protein At5g50850 could also play the same role as
dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase. Moreover, other
proteins that interact with At5g50850 are all annotated
as pyruvate dehydrogenase and proteins that are connected with At1g54220 all have the annotation as a
dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase. These interactions
further demonstrate that the function similarity exists
between interactive protein pair. These evidences confirm the feasibility to predict protein function on the
basis of PPI networks.
As discussed above, our interactome contains large
amount of validated functional linkage information,
which provide rich resource to investigate the potential
new mechanisms and characterize the gene/protein new
function under systematical level. Although our current
interactome and other predicted protein interaction
datasets for Arabidopis have certain limitation, they provide the first step towards understanding the architecture and function of the cellular network. It can be
expected that the genome-wide protein interactome will
be better delineated both in coverage and accuracy
through the bioinformatics integration with the increase
of the genomic and proteomic experimental data in the
future.

Conclusion
A predictive protein-protein interaction network in the
organism plant Arabidopsis thaliana has been already
constructed according to our research. Our interactome
is a comprehensive genome-wide network and provides

Page 10 of 14

a rich resource for researchers in related field to study
the protein function, molecular interaction and potential
mechanism under different conditions. Anyone who are
interested in the field of genome-wide protein-protein
interaction network and corresponding annotation information could go to AtPID to access the comprehensive
data.

Methods
A gold standard positive set and a gold standard
negative set

A gold standard positive set (GSP) was constructed on
the basis of the data from databases IntAct, BIND,
TAIR and text mining. During the process of text
mining, we have collected PPI data with experimental
evidence and references. To ensure the reliability of
these data, we also conducted a validation process. First,
PPIs collected from the literature without AGI locus
identifiers were mapped to IPI. Symbols without a
match were removed. 3,866 protein-protein interaction
pairs involving 1,875 proteins were extracted based on
this filtration process. Additionally, protein components
in partial enzyme complexes were also added to GSP
based on the assumption that components of an enzyme
complex have not only high functional association but
also potential physical interactions. Enzyme complexes
from KEGG[21] were downloaded, the overlapping part
between these complex data and interaction data from
text mining were extracted as a part of gold standard
positive set. Subsequently we examined the property of
PPI in protein complex. Because many subunits or components of an enzyme complex are constructed with
regards to sequence similarity with other species or
orthologs, validated physical protein interaction data
was referred to reduce noise and redundant information
here. By means of comparing the proteins pairs in complex with the existed part of GSP, we found that most
protein-protein pairs of enzyme complex that had more
than eighteen components did not have the evidence of
interaction in our GSP. On the contrary, almost all protein pairs in the complex that processed less than eighteen components were supported by our GSP to have
interactions. So we only added the protein pairs that
existed in less than eighteen components complex into
our GSP set. In all, 800 unique pairs were obtained
according to enzyme complex after excluding the redundancies from the 3,866 pairs via text mining. Consequently, a total of 4,129 interaction pairs involving 2,285
proteins were collected to form a gold standard set. A
gold standard negative set (GSN), contains 196,855 protein pairs, was set up based on the different sublocation
information according to the Gene Ontology database.
Only the data marked with evidence code of “IC”, “IDA”
and “IPI”, that guaranteed high quality of the data, were

taken into consideration in order to build gold standard
negative set. 13 pairs of identical protein-pair, which
appeared in both sets, were removed both from GSP
and GSN. The LR score of any protein protein interaction pairs are calculated on the basis of our reliable GSP
and GSN.
Method of PPI prediction

In terms of the method of ortholog interactome, we followed the methods proposed by Chinnaiyan [4]. Firstly,
we queried high-throughput interactome data in four
model organisms: Sacchromyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and homo sapiens
[39-42]Secondly, we searched the ortholog proteins in

Arabidopsis thaliana with the help of Inparanoid
[43-45]. Then, four Arabidopsis interactomes were generated based on the four species. Each interactome has a
LR score of its own. The data that presents the amount
of predictive protein protein interaction pairs in Arabidopsis thaliana derived from the interactomes in the
above four species is showed in table 1 and the final LR
score used in Bayesian integrative approach is the largest LR generated with ortholog interactome among
these four model organisms. (Additional file 6 table 1)
Gene expression profile is also generally used to infer
protein protein interaction since previous studies have
already demonstrate that the genes encoding interactive
proteins have the similar expression patterns under

Xu et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11(Suppl 2):S2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/S2/S2

different conditions. We have chosen five groups of
chips: ME00345, ME00338, ME00331, ME00326 and
ME00319 to detect the similarity of the gene expression
patterns. After preprocessing of these chips with MAS5
we calculated the Pearson Correlation for each pair of
genes among the above chips with R package[46]. The
identified coexpressed proteins with their Pearson Correlation as LR have been integrated into our whole networks. (Additional file 6 table 4-8)
Domain is a function unit of a protein and participates
in intermolecular interactions, each protein is a collection of conserved domains. Therefore, it can infer the
protein interaction from related domain interaction, we
could conclude that two proteins have interactions if
domains in each protein have confirmed interactions.
We got domain interactive information from Pfam database and induced the PPI information through mapping
domain interactive data to protein information from
TAIR (7). (Additional file 6 table 2)
Gene Ontology, that has a hierarchical structure,
describes the biological relationship for both genes and
its products of different species. A reasonable hypothesis
is that the more components a GO term has, the less
likely that interaction will exits between the components
of the same GO term. We used the method of SSBP [4]
to predict PPI on the structure of GO. We parsed the
obo file from Gene ontology, and then counted the
number of genes under each GO term. Next, we used
the decision tree J48 to discrete SSBP score and calculate the LR. (Additional file 6 table 3)
Gene fusion, phylogenetic profile and gene neighbor
were all exerted according to sequence information.
Gene fusion method was based on the hypothesis that
the homologues of two interactive proteins in one species may fuse into a single protein in another species.
Phylogenetic profile supposed that two proteins with the
similar profiles in different species might have interactions or functional linkages. The hypothesis of gene
neighbor method is that proteins with neighborhood
relationships would have a higher probability to have
interaction or form a protein complex than the proteins
that do not have such relationship. We also used these
three genome context methods to infer the protein protein interactions in Arabidopsis thaliana. The result of
these three methods were integrated with the results of
domain and SSBP to form a new combined method to
represent functional linkage and sequence similarity
between two proteins, thus predicting the interactions
between the two proteins. (Additional file 6 table 9-11)
Data integration: Naïve Bayesian approach

This approach provides a mathematical rule to explain
how to adjust the odds of a protein-protein pair interaction based on new predictive evidence. The prior odds

Page 12 of 14

of interactions can be calculated by the probability of
finding an interacting pair among all protein pairs
divided by the probability of finding a non-interacting
pair.
Oprior=P(pos)/P(neg)
The posterior odds or the odds that two proteins have
interaction based on new predictive evidence are
defined as:
O B posterior B = P ( pos | f 1...fn ) / P ( neg | f1...fn )

Where f B i B is a protein pair’s value in dataset i.
Likelihood score, which reflect both the sensitivity and
specificity, for each corresponding set of prior odds
were computed based on a derivation of Bayesian rule:
O B posterior B = O B prior B * L ( f1...fn )

With the approach described above we could get the
LR score of each PPI pair, and the main LR of a certain
PPI pair is the product of the LR score from different
methods.
The Naïve Bayesian method is used to integrate the
datasets that are independent to each other. However,
the independence of our methods of predicting PPI is
hard to affirm and we are unable to prove that the features used in our study to be independent. We have
explored the independence of these methods and calculated the combined LR of each two methods, but the
criterion of independence between two methods is hard
to be fixed (data not shown). Given that gene neighbor,
gene fusion and phylogenetic profile are all predictive
methods on the basis of the sequence information, their
independence can therefore be regarded weakly.
Furthermore, SSBP represents the functional consistence
of two proteins more than real physical interaction and
two proteins that have domain interactions may not
have physical interactions because of protein location or
other biological constrains. In order to follow the
requirement of Bayesian approach and enhance the
reliability of our predictive interactome, we combined
the methods of gene neighbor, gene fusion, phylogenetic
profile and SSBP together and validate the PPI pair
obtained by these four methods with protein domain
method. The result of this combined new PPI predictive
method is treated as representing the aspect of functional consistent of a PPI pair, which is a new feature
used in our Bayesian Integration process. As to the
methods of ortholog and gene coexpression, their
hypotheses based on which that a PPI pair has been predicted to have interaction are different and do not relate
to the functional consistent. We have regarded that

Xu et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11(Suppl 2):S2
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/S2/S2

these three methods, including ortholog interactome,
gene expression and the new combined method are
independent to each other. The final LR score of our
PPI network is the product of the LR scores of the three
above methods.
