Abstract
Background: The role of hybridization in generating diversity in animals is an active area of
discovery and debate. We assess hybridization across a contact zone of northern (Myodes rutilus)
and southern (M. gapperi) red-backed voles using variation in skeletal features and both
mitochondrial and nuclear loci. This transect extends approximately 550 km along the North Pacific
Coast of North America and encompasses 26 populations (n = 485). We establish the history,
geographic extent and directionality of hybridization, determine whether hybridization is ongoing,
and assess the evolutionary stability of novel genomic combinations.
Results: Identification of M. rutilus and M. gapperi based on the degree of closure of the post-palatal
bridge was concordant with the distribution of diagnostic nuclear MYH6 alleles; however, an 80 km
zone of introgressed populations was identified. The introgressant form is characterized by having
mitochondrial haplotypes closely related to the northern M. rutilus on a nuclear background and
morphological characteristics of southern M. gapperi.
Conclusion: Introgression appears to have been historic as pure populations of M. rutilus are now
isolated to the north from introgressants or pure M. gapperi by the LeConte Glacier. As we do not
find pure M. rutilus or M. gapperi individuals throughout the distribution of the introgressant form,
it appears that the introgressants are a self-sustaining entity not requiring continued hybridization
between pure parental forms to generate this novel combination of characters.

Background
The evolutionary significance of hybridization has been
widely recognized in some taxa such as plants, but our
understanding of how this process contributes to animal
diversity, especially in vertebrates is relatively limited [13]. Ecological and demographic settings known to contribute to hybridization between otherwise well-defined
species include newly established contact (such that
behavioral, pre-zygotic filters to breeding may not exist)

and low density of one or both parental species such that
conspecific mating opportunities are limited [4]. Such
biogeographic and demographic conditions are known to
characterize many areas of interspecific, post-glacial contact where the leading edges of the expanding ranges of
post-glacial colonizers meet [5-8]. Such regions provide a
unique opportunity to examine the origin and maintenance of hybrid forms within an increasingly well-understood biogeographic and temporal framework.

Hybrid zones between species are thought to be maintained by two primary classes of models that predict 1)
differential fitness between pure parental and hybrid individuals and 2) differential degrees of spatial overlap
between pure parental species. The 'tension zone' model
[4] posits a dynamic balance between selection against
hybrids and dispersal of hybrids into the zone while the
'bounded superiority' model [9] holds that hybrids are
superior to pure parental types in a limited set of environments. As such, the tension zone model necessitates continued generation of hybrid offspring from pure parentals
so such systems would be characterized by sympatry of
pure parental and hybrid forms on a spatial scale that
encompasses the dispersal distances of the focal species.
Alternatively, if hybrids have a selective advantage, even in
a limited set of environmental conditions, we would predict little to no spatial overlap between pure parental and
hybrid individuals. If the distribution of hybrid-appropriate habitat is at a scale that greatly exceeds the dispersal
distance of pure parentals, maintaining occupancy of
these areas would require that the introgressed form
become independently sustaining. It is through this latter
scenario that introgressive hybridization could establish
stable, evolutionarily independent populations.
A particularly common hybrid form is a pattern of mitochondrial introgression leading to novel cytonuclear combinations. Because mitochondrial DNA is maternally
inherited, this pattern can exist in animals where females
are the homogametic sex (i.e. mammals). Due to reproductive inferiority of the heterogametic sex (Haldane's
rule), the perpetuation of such novel cytonuclear combinations is prevented in animals with heterogametic
females [10]. A plausible model for a pattern of mitochondrial introgression would be one wherein interspecific hybrids initially backcross with the most available
pure parental species and then become a self-perpetuating
entity, perhaps even displacing pure parentals. Under
such a model, introgressant hybrids would be characterized by a mitochondrial genome of one parental taxon on
a genomic background composed predominantly of that
of a second taxon. Phylogenetic relationships and overall
levels of diversity of mitochondrial types in the new introgressant hybrid form relative to the parental taxa could
provide a great deal of insight into the origin of the introgressant form as well as subsequent factors contributing to
the maintenance of these novel combinations.
Where the distributions of the northern red-backed vole
(Myodes rutilus) and southern red-backed vole (Myodes
gapperi) meet, we have an opportunity to examine interspecific interactions at the leading edge of two expanding
ranges. As the ice sheets retreated, M. rutilus expanded its
distribution south from Beringia, while M. gapperi colonized northward into Canada approximately 13,500 years
before present (Ka) [11,12]. Hybridization between the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/114

two species has been hypothesized based on discordance
between morphological and mitochondrial traits in a limited number of field-collected specimens [13], convergence in allozyme variation in areas of contact [14] as well
as successful interspecific crosses in the laboratory [15].
Despite their capacity to interbreed, M. rutilus and M. gapperi are not sister lineages and are separated by approximately 9% sequence divergence in the mitochondrial
cytochrome b gene [16]. Our goals were to 1) establish the
geographic extent and directionality of any introgression
between these taxa in southeast Alaska, 2) assess whether
hybridization between M. rutilus and M. gapperi is ongoing and/or historic, and 3) assess the evolutionary stability of any novel genomic combinations.

Results
Post-palatal bridge morphology
There was a distinct break in character state of the postpalatal bridge near the Stikine River (Table 1). Individuals
from Jap Creek (locality 7, Figure 1) and north had
incomplete post-palatal bridges, which is the same character state observed in the M. rutilus from the reference sample (interior Alaska), and from throughout its range
(Runck in prep). Individuals from Mallard Slough (locality 8, Figure 1) and south had complete bridges, characteristic of the M. gapperi reference sample (Minnesota) and
from specimens of M. gapperi throughout its range (Figure
1; Runck in prep). There were, however, two individuals
(localities 3 & 4), north of Mallard Slough that possessed
complete post-palatal bridges, and two individuals (localities 14 & 23) south of Mallard Slough that had incomplete post-palatal bridges. In interior Alaska, 5 of 46 M.
rutilus individuals had complete post-palatal bridges suggesting a low incidence of natural variation within this
character in the northern red-backed vole.
Nuclear gene MYH6 genetic variation
Phylogenetic analyses of sequences of MYH6 revealed two
clades with an average uncorrected pairwise divergence of
1.94% (Figure 2). Maximum likelihood, neighbor-joining, and Bayesian analyses produced similar topologies.
Individuals from Jap Creek (locality 7) and northward
had alleles that formed a clade with M. rutilus from western Alaska and Russia (Figure 2). Individuals from Mallard Slough (locality 8) and southward had alleles that
formed a clade with M. gapperi from Minnesota and British Columbia. Uncorrected sequence divergence between
the outgroup taxa and the M. gapperi and M. rutilus clades
were 2.98% and 1.80%, respectively. None of the
sequenced individuals was heterozygous at the diagnostic
nucleotide positions.

Further sampling of the species-specific SNP using RFLP
analyses resulted in the digestion pattern diagnostic of M.
rutilus in all individuals from Jap Creek (7) northward,
while all individuals from Mallard Slough (8) southward

had MYH6 alleles diagnostic of M. gapperi. We found no
individuals heterozygous for species-specific alleles.
Mitochondrial genetic variation and character
concordance
We found 46 unique mitochondrial cytochrome b haplotypes in our entire sample. Patterns of variation across haplotypes were characteristic of functional mitochondrial
genes, with average base frequencies of A (29.3) G (13.5) C
(29.6) T (27.6), a 3.64 transition/transversion ratio, and a
gamma distribution of 0.75 of changes across classes of
codon sites. In addition, the distribution of the variable
amino acid residues was consistent with the model of variable and conserved regions in cytochrome b [17].

Phylogenetic reconstruction using maximum likelihood,
Bayesian, and neighbor-joining methods produced simi-

lar topologies consisting of two highly supported clades,
A and B (bootstrap support of 100; Figure 3). Average
pairwise sequence divergence between southeast Alaska
individuals in clades A and B is 7.2% (uncorrected p distance). Clade A haplotypes extended from Siberia,
through western Alaska, and along the southeast Alaskan
coast north of Hut Point (15; Figure 3). Clade B haplotypes were found in Minnesota and British Columbia as
well as the southeast Alaskan coast from Hut Point (15)
southward to Gwent Cove (19) on the mainland, Tyee
(11) to Bond Bay (22), on the Cleveland Peninsula, and
Wrangell (23), Etolin (24), and Revillagigedo (25, 26)
islands. Through additional RFLP screening of cytochrome b, we determined that all individuals north of the
Stikine River (localities 1–8) and individuals up to 80 km
south of the Stikine River (localities 9 – 15) had Clade A
mitochondrial haplotypes. Clade B haplotypes were

found on the mainland south of Hut Point (localities 15
– 19), on the Cleveland Peninsula (localities 11, 12, 20 –
22) and on Wrangell (locality 23), Etolin (locality 24),
and Revillagigedo islands (localities 25, 26). Contact
between the two divergent haplotype clades were found at
localities 11, 12, and 15.
Individuals with Clade A haplotypes that were also characterized by the post-palatal bridge morphology of M.
rutilus and MYH6 alleles concordant with this morphology were only found north of Jap Creek (7). Hereafter, we
refer to these individuals as M. rutilus. Individuals with
Clade B haplotypes and the post-palatal bridge morphology of M. gapperi and MYH6 alleles concordant with this
morphology were found on Etolin (23), Wrangell (24),
Revillagigedo (25, 26) islands, the Cleveland Peninsula
(20 – 22), and south of Hut Point (15), (hereafter M. gapperi). All individuals from Mallard Slough (8) south to
Berg Bay (10) and Unuk and Chickamin rivers (13 & 14)
had the post palatal bridge morphology and MYH6
sequence characteristic of M. gapperi but a set of cytochrome b haplotypes more closely related to pure M.
rutilus (hereafter introgressants; Figure 1). Introgressants
were found in sympatry with M. gapperi only at localities
11, 12, and 15 (Figure 1; Table 1). Though haplotypes
found within the introgressant individuals as a group
were most closely related to M. rutilus, none was identical
to haplotypes found in populations of M. rutilus. A
synapomorphic mutation (position 513) was shared by
all but one individual (Reflection Lake; locality 12) of the
45 sequenced introgressants.
To further resolve haplotype relationships within the two
major clades, we constructed statistical parsimony networks using cytochrome b sequence variation without violating the parsimony criterion, as haplotypes within each
clade were ≤10 mutational steps away from each other.
The Clade A network had two major subclades, one consisting of haplotypes only found in the introgressant form
(Figure 4; indicated in grey) and the other consisting of all
pure M. rutilus individuals and one introgressant (Figure
4). The maximum distance between pure M. rutilus individuals was five mutations (0.008%) and between introgressant individuals six mutations (0.01%). Two ancestral
haplotypes were inferred in the Clade B network (internal
nodes) and a maximum distance of 5 mutations
(0.008%) was found among these M. gapperi haplotypes
(Figure 5).
Haplotype diversity was highest in M. gapperi (0.906 +/0.01) and in the introgressants (0.874 +/- 0.04) and lowest in M. rutilus (0.633 +/- 0.07; Table 2). Likewise, nucleotide diversity was highest in M. gapperi and the
introgressants (0.003 +/- 0.002) and lowest in M. rutilus
(0.001 +/- 0.001). Even though the introgressant haplo-

Demographic history and molecular evolution
Values obtained through Fu's test of selective neutrality
were largely negative and significantly different from zero
(Table 2), which is expected for populations undergoing
recent growth. However, negative values can also be a
result of selection. The mismatch distributions were unimodal for M. rutilus, M. gapperi, and the introgressants,
which is expected for populations undergoing sudden
expansion or under certain selective regimes (Figure 6).

Estimates of the timing of any expansion events (τ ) were
very similar in M. gapperi and the introgressants, but more

mismatch distributions (τ ) were used to calculate time
since expansion (t = τ /2u), which we estimate to be 9.46
Ka (95% CI range 7.91 – 12.0 Ka) for M. gapperi and 8.57
Ka (95% CI range 5.86 – 11.95 Ka) for the introgressants.

rutilus at 4.31 Ka (95% CI range 2.12 – 6.74 Ka).
Relative rate tests were conducted using pairwise lineage
comparisons and M. rufocanus as an outgroup. Because of
saturation, rates of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) could not be calculated, so rates of synony-

ecological interactions [5-8,18]. Historical genetic signatures of heterospecific mitochondrial genes may be preserved in hybrid zone populations that are no longer
undergoing genetic exchange. Examination of these populations using population and coalescent methods should
provide insight into the timing and dynamics of geographical shifts in species' ranges in response to climate
change [8,19].

mous transversions per fourfold degenerate site were
estimated (B4), as the rate of evolution in transversions is
slower. Pairwise lineage comparisons of B4 showed no significant difference among the rates of evolution (p > 0.27).
Rates of non-synonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (Ka) were also similar among the lineages (p >
0.30; results not shown). The molecular clock hypothesis
was not violated, as likelihood scores of trees constructed
with and without molecular clock constraints were not significantly different (χ2 = 44.8 d.f. = 176, P > 0.05).

Discussion
After the retreat of Pleistocene glaciers, distributions of
many high latitude organisms shifted resulting in new
species assemblages and opportunities for genetic and

Concordance of diagnostic characters
Identification of M. rutilus and M. gapperi in this transect
based on the degree of closure of the post-palatal bridge
was concordant 98.7% of the time with the distribution of
the species-specific MYH6 alleles, with the exception of
four individuals. The discordance observed in these individuals was a result of the character state of the post-palatal bridge being opposite of what was found in all other
members of their respective population. We therefore reason that because there is a distinct change in the developmental state of the post-palatal bridge at the Stikine River
area and this character distinguishes M. rutilus from M.
gapperi. This abrupt change in frequency of the ossification of post-palatal bridge and distribution of the MYH6
diagnostic alleles coincides with Hall's [20] depiction of
parapatry of M. rutilus and M. gapperi at the Stikine River
area.

The distribution of highly differentiated mitochondrial
cytochrome b haplotypes was not concordant with the
morphological and nuclear characters. Our analysis
revealed three groups: M. rutilus is characterized by an
incomplete post-palatal bridge and a set of closely related
MYH6 alleles and cytochrome b haplotypes; M. gapperi is
characterized by a complete post-palatal bridge and a set
of closely related MYH6 alleles and cytochrome b haplotypes that are highly differentiated from those of M. rutilus
(1.9% and 7.2%, respectively); and an introgressant form
that has the post palatal bridge and MYH6 alleles of M.
gapperi but a set of cytochrome b haplotypes that is
unique, yet clearly more closely related to M. rutilus haplotypes. Thus, across an 80 km expanse separating pure M.
rutilus and M. gapperi populations, these introgressant redbacked voles are characterized by a combination of features of both M. rutilus and M. gapperi.

M. rutilus that now exist north of the LeConte Glacier
(4.31 Ka).
Given our refined view of the distribution of M. rutilus and
M. gapperi and potential barriers, there appears to be no
contemporary contact between these species in this
transect. Consistent with that view, is the lack of MYH6
heterozygotes with alleles diagnostic of pure M. rutilus
and M. gapperi that might suggest ongoing hybridization
with M. rutilus [23]. Likewise, inspection of the post-palatal bridge, presumably controlled by multiple nuclear
loci, revealed no intermediate morphs.
In addition to not finding evidence for contemporary
gene exchange between these two species, we did not find
the parental species in sympatry. Furthermore, there was
not extensive overlap of the introgressants with the pure
parentals. M. gapperi and the introgressants occur in sympatry only at the southern edges of the zone of introgressants (localities 11, 12, 15), and the current tidewater
position of the LeConte Glacier prevents contemporary
contact of pure M. rutilus with voles in areas farther south
that are now occupied by introgressants or, even farther
south, by pure M. gapperi. As such, it would appear that
the introgressants are self-sustaining populations and not
hybrids that are continuously generated from pure parental crosses. An active contact zone does exist, however, at
the southern, leading edge of the introgressant distribution and the northern edge of pure M. gapperi (at localities
11, 12, 15). The direction and degree of genetic exchange
at the latter contact zone is the subject of an ongoing study
(Runck et al., in prep). Future ecological studies should
explore whether abiotic or biotic shifts are associated with
the transition between these groups and/or whether direct
competitive interactions limit their coexistence.

Colonization and hybridization dynamics
Estimates of expansion times into southeast Alaska
obtained from the mismatch distribution (t = τ /2u) indicate that these species arrived post-glacially. Working
under the assumption that rates of evolution are consistent among these three groups, estimates of time since
expansion are similar in M. gapperi and the introgressants,
dating to 9.46 Ka and 8.57 Ka, respectively. As introgressants largely reflect the genetic signature of the hybridizing M. rutilus, expansion of both species into southeast
Alaska date back to the early Holocene [21,22]. These estimates of expansion into southeast Alaska are notably earlier than the expansion time of those pure populations of

Origin of mitochondrial signature in introgressants
The introgressant form is characterized by a monophyletic
group of mitochondrial haplotypes nested within haplotypes otherwise characteristic of M. rutilus. Nonetheless,
the introgressed group possesses a distinct mitochondrial
genetic signature from M. rutilus populations across this
region. Notably, not only do the introgressants not share
any haplotypes with M. rutilus, they also have significantly
greater mitochondrial variability than the donor species.

Three plausible scenarios could lead to this distinct
genetic signature of novel, but closely related, haplotypes
and overall higher mtDNA diversity that characterize the
introgressants. First, increased mitochondrial diversity in
the introgressants may simply reflect differences in population history when compared to M. rutilus in southeast
Alaska. The higher estimates of mitochondrial diversity in
the introgressants are similar to those for other populations of M. rutilus outside of southeast Alaska. For 54 M.

rutilus found across a much greater geographic sampling
area in northwestern Canada and interior Alaska, estimates are comparable to the level of diversity seen in the
introgressants, with nucleotide diversity of 0.003, 19 segregating sites, and τ = 1.63 (unpublished data). Therefore,
it is possible that contemporary populations of M. rutilus
in southeast Alaska previously had higher levels of diversity, but lost diversity (e.g., through bottleneck events)
after hybridizing with M. gapperi. This hypothesis does not
explain the lack of shared haplotypes between the introgressants and M. rutilus, however, so southeast Alaskan M.
rutilus subsequently must have lost all the haplotypes now
found exclusively in the introgressants.
A possible alternative is that southeast Alaska may have
served as a glacial refugium during the Last Glacial Maximum for red-backed voles. Under this scenario, a more
diverse population of M. rutilus originally hybridized with
M. gapperi thus creating the introgressants, which captured
and sustained M. rutilus haplotype diversity. As glaciers
retreated, genetic diversity was lost from coastal populations of pure M. rutilus as they expanded northward
(reflected in low mitochondrial variation in contemporary populations of M. rutilus). Although southeast Alaska
has been proposed as a coastal refugium for vertebrates
during Pleistocene glacial advances [24,25], we do not
believe this is the case for northern red-backed voles
again, because no introgressant haplotypes are shared
with contemporary populations of M. rutilus.
A hypothesis that seems most consistent with the available
data implicates multiple waves of colonization of M. rutilus
into this coastal region. Multiple colonization events of M.
rutilus into the region could also lead to this pattern of distinct haplotypes in the introgressants. Under this scenario,
gene exchange between the species occurred first with an
early colonizing population of M. rutilus, and the genetic
signature of the introgressants now reflects this ancestral
exchange along with the subsequent accumulation of new
haplotypes through time. Later, a second colonization
event would have given rise to extant M. rutilus in the
region. If these extant-pure M. rutilus are indeed the result
from a second, more recent colonization event, as the estimate of expansion suggests (~4.3 Ka), these voles would
have been isolated from introgressant populations south of
Jap Creek (locality 7) due to the advancement of the
LeConte Glacier to tidewater around 5,000 ybp. Therefore,
genetic exchange between the introgressants and contemporary M. rutilus would have been prevented and would
account for the lack of shared cytochrome b haplotypes and
lack of MYH6 heterozygotes. One would have to posit that
the earlier colonizing wave of M. rutilus was extirpated from
the region or was not sampled in this study.
Regional extinctions and multiple colonizations have
been documented in southeast Alaska during times of cli-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/114

mate oscillations [26] as the North Pacific Coast underwent repeated climatic fluctuations during the Pleistocene
and Holocene. Recent advances correspond to the
Younger Dryas around 10.6-9.9 Ka [27], with three additional advances around 5–6 Ka, 3.5-2.5 Ka, and 200-100
YBP [28-30]. During these cooling events, alpine glaciers
advanced into lower elevations, reducing species ranges.
Due to the extensive glacial coverage of the northern part
of southeast Alaska, M. rutilus may have been susceptible
to extirpation or displacement during periods of cooling
and advancing glaciers.
Marginal support for the multiple waves of colonization of
M. rutilus hypothesis is reflected in the relationship of the
introgressant mtDNA relative to pure M. rutilus in the minimum spanning network and likelihood tree. In both analyses, introgressants form a subgroup, and are not
intermixed with the remaining M. rutilus mitotypes suggesting that these two mitotypes were not part of a panmictic
population. The genetic footprint of an earlier hybridization event supports the hypothesis of multiple colonizations of the northern red-backed vole along the coast.
Evolution of an introgressant contact zone
Although genetic exchange may have been extensive, our
data suggest that a very closely related set of haplotypes
(or a single haplotype that subsequently mutated) was
captured and maintained in the introgressants. The unimodal distribution of pairwise comparisons and position
of the introgressant haplotypes in the network and phylogeny support the hypothesis of a single hybridization
event instead of multiple temporally discrete events. Initial genetic exchange may also have been bidirectional,
but we only have evidence thus far of the mitochondrion
of M. rutilus being maintained on the morphological and
presumably nuclear background of M. gapperi. Nonetheless, a more complete view of the nuclear composition of
the introgressant form relative to the pure parental forms
will provide insight to the extent of backcrossing that
occurred in this system.

Once established, the novel mito-nuclear combination of
the introgressants either diffused neutrally or was selected
for and expanded their distribution while displacing the
pure parentals. While we cannot determine which scenario is responsible for the 80 km zone of introgressants,
it is notable that all individuals in this region are introgressants. Moreover, several of our findings are consistent
with predictions of the bounded superiority hypothesis
[9]. The introgressants and pure parentals do not overlap
extensively and the introgressants are self-sustaining and
are not the result of continual hybridization. Also, consistent with the bounded superiority hypothesis is that the
introgressants occupy a limited area of southeast Alaska,
and have not established populations west of localities 11
and 12 on the Cleveland Peninsula.

The degree of genetic admixture that may have occurred
while the introgressant voles were fairly uncommon relative to pure parentals awaits our more complete sampling
of the nuclear genome of this group. Similar long-term
persistence and spatial expansion of introgressant or
hybrid forms has been documented in snails (genus
Cerion), resulting from an ancient hybridization event
between a now extinct fossil species and an extant species
[31]. Hybrids are hypothesized to have persisted due to
the novel genetic combinations that enhanced survival
during the time that one of the parental species was eliminated [31].
With the advance of the LeConte Glacier to tidewater
approximately 5,000 years ago, any potential for gene
flow between northern M. rutilus and the introgressants
ceased. However at the southern edge, we do find localities (11, 12, and 15) where introgressants overlap spatially with pure M. gapperi suggesting the potential for
ongoing gene flow. Ongoing analyses of microsatellite
genetic variation should identify not only the degree of
overall distinction between the introgressed form and
pure M. gapperi but also the amount of gene flow that
characterizes their current contact zone. Likewise, ecological studies may help identify the degree to which these
groups compete either directly or indirectly with one
another and whether the spatial distribution of each is
currently stable or actively shifting.
A North Pacific Coast suture zone
The North Pacific Coast has been documented as post-glacial contact zone for several mammalian lineages from the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/114

high latitude refugium called Beringia and from multiple
refugia that existed south of the continental ice sheets
[13]. Within species, independent colonizations into this
recently deglaciated region have occurred by at least two
divergent lineages of several species such as dusky shrew
(Sorex monticolus) [32], long-tailed vole (Microtus longicaudus) [33], black bear (Ursus americanus) [34], and marten (Martes americana) [35,36]. Ermine (Mustela erminea)
are represented by three divergent lineages in southeast
Alaska; one is hypothesized to be endemic to the region,
perhaps surviving in the North Pacific Coast during the
Pleistocene [24].
Introgression along the coast has been documented from
divergent lineages of marten [35], black bears [37], and
now red-backed voles. Contact zones are likely for divergent clades of dusky shrews and long-tailed voles, therefore the narrow strip of mainland along the southeast
Alaska coast may be a suture zone, whereby several formerly isolated species have entered the region by discrete
colonization routes, and have subsequently come into
contact in the same geographic area [38-40]. The North
Pacific Coast, and in particular, southeast Alaska, possess
characteristics [38] commonly tied to suture zones, such
as being located between Pleistocene glacial refugia, and
nearby low mountain passes acting as corridors for dispersal [13,41] during warm periods.
A renewed interest has emerged in testing the validity of
Remington's thirteen North American suture zones
through phylogeographic studies [39,40,42]. The North
Pacific Coast was not originally identified as a suture zone
by Remington [38], but phylogeographic studies repeatedly demonstrate the existence of multiple lineages within
species (e.g., shrews, voles) in this region. Populations
representing divergent lineages are now in contact there
following postglacial expansion [43]. Most of these studies, however, have limited ability to detect hybridization
because only mitochondrial genes were assessed. Future
phylogeographic studies of these species should employ
multiple independent characters to more rigorously assess
the influence of geologic and climatic events on structuring diversity along the North Pacific Coast.

Conclusion
Interspecific hybridization between M. rutilus and M. gapperi resulted in the formation of an introgressant group
that spans 80 km. The novel mito-nuclear combination of
these introgressants likely expanded either by displacing
or by colonizing areas left unoccupied by pure parentals
in response to the changing climate of the Holocene.
Hybridization between the two species is historical, as a
region occupied exclusively by the introgressants now separates these two species. Additionally, physical separation
(as a result of glacial advances) of M. rutilus and introgres-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:114

sant populations occurred ca. 5,000 Ka thus establishing
reproductive isolation of this pure parental species and
the introgressants. These introgressive populations appear
to be stable as they are not a result of continuous interspecific matings between the pure parental species.

Methods
Sampling
The temperate rain forest of coastal southeast Alaska is
naturally fragmented by extensive icefields, fjords, and six
major rivers, and is isolated from continental North
America by the St. Elias and Coast Mountains. Sampling
was conducted at 26 localities [44] spanning approximately 550 km along the North Pacific Coast centered on
the Stikine River where M. rutilus and M. gapperi are traditionally depicted as being in contact [20] (Figure 1). Specimens were deposited at the University of Alaska Museum
of the North. A total of 485 individuals (see Additional
file 1) were analyzed, with 5 to 36 individuals from each
locality. Additional individuals of M. rutilus and M. gapperi from localities outside southeast Alaska were included
for comparative purposes.
Morphological data collection
Closure of the post-palatal bridge is the key diagnostic
character used to distinguish M. rutilus from M. gapperi
(Figure 7) [11,20,45,46]. All individuals from the transect
were examined, but in some instances the character state
could not be determined due to skull damage, resulting in
a total 328 individuals analyzed. Character states were
compared with M. rutilus skulls from interior Alaska (n =
46) and M. gapperi skulls from Minnesota (n = 18). Previous analyses of these specimens and others show that
degree of post-palatal closure is not correlated with sex,
age, or latitude, (Runck in prep). Specimens were examined under 25× magnification to score the post palatal
bridge either as A) complete, with medial shelf connected
to lateral parts of the palate, or B) incomplete, with
medial shelf disconnected (Figure 7).
Molecular methods
Genomic DNA was extracted from frozen liver of 95 M.
rutilus and 390 M. gapperi following a modified salt extraction method [24,47].
Nuclear locus, MYH6
Twenty-seven nuclear genes were screened from the collection of comparative anchor tagged sequences to obtain
a diagnostic nuclear perspective on species identification
and to test for interspecific gene flow in the contact zone
[48]. Five loci yielded PCR products in the 300–1000 bp
range. We used the primer set MYH2F and MYH2R to generate a 257 bp fragment of MYH6 (myosin heavy polypeptide 6). Although this primer set was originally designed
to amplify MYH2 (myosin heavy polypeptide 2) [48], a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/114

nucleotide BLAST search against the entire nucleotide collection in GenBank indicated that the amplified fragments
are MYH6.
The identification of species-specific alleles was conducted using broadly distributed individuals of M. rutilus
from Russia, Finland, and western Alaska and individuals
of M. gapperi from Washington, Minnesota, and North
Carolina. Outgroup taxa M. rufocanus and M. glareolus
were also sequenced [16]. From these samples we found
three conserved single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
that distinguish the alleles of M. rutilus and M. gapperi. We
consider this locus to be diagnostic for the two species
because these diagnostic nucleotide differences were
found throughout the species' ranges.
The MYH6 locus was amplified for all individuals (n =
485). Restriction length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of
the MYH6 locus was used to delimit the distribution of
species-specific alleles among individuals. A restriction
site is present at one of the SNPs, and the restriction
enzyme Hpa II was used to digest MYH6 amplicons. Hpa
II cuts the restriction site CCGG, which is present in M.
gapperi at positions 182 – 185, but not in M. rutilus.
Restriction enzyme digestion was completed using 5 μl of
the PCR product, 7.5 units Hpa II, and 5 μl Buffer1 (New
England Biolabs). PCR products were incubated at 37°C
for 5 hours with negative and positive controls. Digested
products were run on 2% agarose stained with ethidium
bromide.
Directing sequencing of MYH6 was conducted on at least
2 individuals from each sampling locality (n = 64; Additional file 1; GenBank FJ638345–FJ638410). Qiagen
Qiaquick purification kits were used to purify PCR products. Purified PCR products were cycle sequenced using
Taq DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit and Big
Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Mix 3.0
(Applied Biosystems Incorporated). Sequencing products
were filtered using Sephadex G-50 in Centrisep spin columns (Princeton Separations). Automated sequencing of
both heavy and light strands was conducted on Applied
Biosystems Incorporated 373 and 3100 DNA sequencers.
Sequences were aligned and compared manually using
Sequence Navigator, Version 1.01 (Applied Biosystems
Incorporated) and Sequencher (GeneCodes). Heterozygous sites were given standard DNA degenerate codes
[23].
Mitochondrial locus, cytochrome b
PCR was used to amplify the first 632 base pairs of the
cytochrome b gene with the primers MVZ 05 [49] and
CLETH 06 [50] following established protocols [50].
Cytochrome b fragments were used in subsequent restriction enzyme digestions and direct sequencing.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:114

Direct sequencing of the cytochrome b gene fragment was
conducted on at least five individuals from each sampling
locality (Additional file 1), resulting in a total of 47
sequences of M. rutilus and 125 of M. gapperi (GenBank
FJ616001–FJ616166). Additional sequences were generated from one M. rutilus from Russia and one from western Alaska, and from one M. gapperi from British
Columbia. Cytochrome b PCR products were purified
using polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation [51]. Purified PCR products were cycle sequenced using Taq DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit and Big Dye
Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Mix 3.0
(Applied Biosystems Incorporated). Sequencing products
were filtered using Sephadex G-50 in Centrisep spin columns (Princeton Separations). Automated sequencing of
both heavy and light strands was conducted on Applied
Biosystems Incorporated 373 and 3100 DNA sequencers.
Sequences were aligned and compared manually using
Sequence Navigator, Version 1.01 (Applied Biosystems
Incorporated) and Sequencher (GeneCodes).
RFLP analysis was conducted on all individuals (n = 485) to
determine the distribution of M. rutilus and M. gapperi cytochrome b gene haplotypes within the 26 populations. The
ALU I restriction site AGCT is present in M. rutilus at position
513 but not in M. gapperi [16,50]. Cytochrome b fragments
were digested using 3.5 units of ALU I, 1.0 ul Buffer2 (New
England BioLabs), and 5.0 ul PCR product. Positive and negative controls were included to confirm enzyme activity in
each trial. PCR products were digested for 5 hours at 37°C
and then visualized on a 2.0% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Digestion of the cytochrome b fragment
resulted in two bands for M. rutilus and one band for M. gapperi. Distributions of the two haplotypes were mapped.
Phylogenetic analysis
We analyzed 257 bp of the MYH6 locus using maximum
likelihood and neighbor-joining algorithms in
PAUP*b10 [52] and Bayesian statistics in Mr. Bayes v3.4
[53]. Individuals of M. rutilus from western Alaska and
Russia and individuals of M. gapperi from Minnesota and
British Columbia were also included in the analyses. M.
rufocanus and M. glareolus sequences were included as outgroups. The model HKY [54] was determined as the simplest model that best fit these data through Modeltest [55]
and was used in the analyses. Neighbor-joining analyses
used 1000 bootstrap replicates to assess nodal support.
The Bayesian analysis started with a random tree and was
run for 1.0 × 107 generations sampling every 1,000 generations. A consensus of three runs was computed after stationarity was reached.

The first 600 base pairs of cytochrome b from 172 southeast coastal individuals were used in phylogenetic analyses. M. rutilus from Russia and western Alaska and M.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/114

gapperi from British Columbia were included in addition
to a published sequence from Minnesota [GenBank:AY952173] [50]. M. rufocanus [GenBank:AY309416]
[16] and M. glareolus [GenBank:AF119272] [56] were
included as outgroups. The Tamura-Nei [57] model of
nucleotide evolution with invariable sites (0.4036) and
gamma distribution (0.7468) was identified using Modeltest as the model that best fit these data, and was used in
subsequent analyses. Phylogeographic relationships were
reconstructed using maximum likelihood and neighborjoining algorithms in PAUP*b10 [52]. Nodal strength was
assessed using 1000 bootstrap replicates. Bayesian statistics were also used to reconstruct phylogeographic relationships in Mr. Bayes v3.4 [53]. Bayesian reconstruction
started from a random tree and was run with four heated
chains for 1.0 × 107generations, sampling every 1,000
generations. Three runs were conducted and nodal support (posterior probability) was computed from the three
runs after stationarity was reached.
Two cytochrome b statistical parsimony networks were
constructed for the two clades of haplotypes [58]. Haplotypes were connected based on the absolute number of
mutational differences and coalescent theory was used to
identify ancestral (internal) and derived (tip) relationships [59] in the program TCS v1.21 [60]. Ten mutational
steps between any two haplotypes is the maximum difference allowable in order to reconstruct the relationships
while meeting the parsimony criterion with 95% probability [58].
The M. rutilus haplotype network was constructed using
11 haplotypes representing 47 M. rutilus individuals and
also included 17 M. rutilus-like haplotypes found in 45
individuals identified morphologically as M. gapperi
(introgressants). The M. gapperi haplotype network was
constructed using 18 haplotypes representing 80 M. gapperi individuals.
Demographic history and molecular evolution
Variation of cytochrome b sequences was used to test for
signals of population expansion, to estimate the time
since expansion, and to estimate mutation rates. Haplotype diversity (h) and nucleotide diversity (π) were estimated [61] separately for M. rutilus, M. gapperi, and
introgressants in the program Arlequin ver. 3.11 [62]. Differences in levels of diversity were tested using a t-test. The
frequency distribution of pairwise differences (mismatch
distribution) [63] and Fu's FS statistic [64,65] were calculated to test for population expansion in Arlequin ver.
3.11. Under the Sudden Expansion Model, pairwise differences will have a unimodal distribution [66]. Values of
Fu's FS will be negative and indicative of expansion when
there is an excess of singleton mutations or a when a gene
is under selection [65].

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:114

The peak of the unimodal distribution (τ ) [66,67] in the
mismatch distribution was used to calculate time since
expansion in Arlequin. Applying the equation τ = 2 μt
where μ is the mutation rate and t is time in generations
[66], allows an estimate of time since expansion. Confidence intervals of τ were calculated using parametric
bootstrapping [68]. Using the mutation rate of 7.5% per
million years [69], and values of τ obtained from mismatch analyses, we estimated time since expansion for M.
gapperi, M. rutilus and introgressants.
To test for constancy in rates of cytochrome b evolution
among lineages, we conducted a relative rates test in rrTree
v1.1 [70], which calculates synonymous and non-synonymous rates of evolution [71,72]. We also constrained the
ML phylogeny to a molecular clock in PAUP*4.0b10 [52]
and performed a log likelihood ratio test of log likelihood
scores of constrained and unconstrained trees and compared these values to a χ2 distribution.
