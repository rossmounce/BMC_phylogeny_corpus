Abstract
Background: Subcellular trafficking is a hallmark of eukaryotic cells. Because of their pivotal role
in the process, a great deal of attention has been paid to the SNARE proteins. Most R-SNAREs, or
"longins", however, also possess a highly conserved, N-terminal fold. This "longin domain" is known
to play multiple roles in regulating SNARE activity and targeting via interaction with other trafficking
proteins. However, the diversity and complement of longins in eukaryotes is poorly understood.
Results: Our comparative genome survey identified a novel family of longin-related proteins,
dubbed the "Phytolongins" because they are specific to land plants. Phytolongins share with longins
the N-terminal longin domain and the C-terminal transmembrane domain; however, in the central
region, the SNARE motif is replaced by a novel region. Phylogenetic analysis pinpoints the
Phytolongins as a derivative of the plant specific VAMP72 longin sub-family and allows elucidation
of Phytolongin evolution.
Conclusion: "Longins" have been defined as R-SNAREs composed of both a longin domain and a
SNARE motif. However, expressed gene isoforms and splice variants of longins are examples of
non-SNARE motif containing longins. The discovery of Phytolongins, a family of non-SNARE longin
domain proteins, together with recent evidence on the conservation of the longin-like fold in
proteins involved in both vesicle fusion (e.g. the Trs20 tether) and vesicle formation (e.g. σ and μ
adaptin) highlight the importance of the longin-like domain in protein trafficking and suggest that it
was one of the primordial building blocks of the eukaryotic membrane-trafficking machinery.

Background
Membrane-trafficking is a crucial process in eukaryotic
cells. In recent years, the combination of structural biology, molecular cell biology and bio-informatics has
allowed the definition of many of the key proteins families involved. Genome-wide analyses of both animals and
plants, known to possess complex and tightly regulated

protein-trafficking systems, have shown extensive sets of
such membrane-trafficking protein machinery [1,2].
Among these, the soluble NSF attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) play a central role in the control of membrane fusion and of protein and lipid traffic [3,4]. SNAREs
have been divided into major groups based on either their
presence in the vesicle (v-SNAREs) or target membrane (tPage 1 of 13

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:510

SNAREs) or based on the presence of a conserved critical
residue in the 0 polar layer, either arginine (R-SNAREs) or
glutamine (Q-SNAREs) [5].
Despite being best characterised in animals, plants and
fungi, SNAREs are, in fact, conserved features of the
eukaryotic membrane-trafficking system. Comparative
genomics and molecular phylogenetics have shown that
the four major SNARE super-families (see [6] for a recent
update on SNAREs classification) were already present in
the Last Common Eukaryotic Ancestor (LCEA) [7]. The
syntaxins or Qa-SNARE super-family has been examined
in detail, demonstrating that even the five major organelle
and pathway specific families had already evolved before
the emergence of the current eukaryotic super-groups
[8,9].
The cytoplasmic region of some R-SNAREs, the short
VAMPs or "Brevins" (e.g. animal synaptobrevins, yeast
Snc1/2), consists of simply the SNARE motif. However,
many R-SNAREs also possess a conserved amino-terminal
Longin Domain (LD), thus characterizing a large family of
long VAMPs or "Longins" [10]. The longins are divided in
three main families based on homology to prototypical
proteins Ykt6p, Sec22b and TI-VAMP/VAMP7; the LD of
Ykt6 and Sec22b show the same globular fold, based on a
five-stranded β-sheet core sandwiched by one α-helix on
one side and two α-helices on the other [11]. The LD of
Ykt6p contains a hydrophobic patch that can inhibit the
formation of a fusion complex by intramolecular binding
to the coiled-coil domain (SNARE motif); mutation of a
conserved Phe residue within this patch abrogates this
interaction [12]. Recently, residues in the SNARE motif
that are crucial to bind the LD have been identified for
Sec22b [13]. Many of these residues are conserved and the
same as those involved in SNARE motif binding in TIVAMP/VAMP7 [14]. Intriguingly, the LD of human TIVAMP/VAMP7 is capable of playing a dual role because,
in addition to negatively regulating the ability of either TIVAMP/VAMP7 or a LD-synaptobrevin chimera to participate in SNARE complexes, it is also able to target TIVAMP/VAMP7 to the late endosomal compartment by
interacting with the δ subunit of the AP3 adaptor complex
[15] and to interact with the ArfGAP HRB in retrieval from
the plasma membrane [14,16]. Such capacity to regulate
subcellular localization (SCL) is shown also by the LD of
the Arabidopsis thaliana VAMP7 proteins [17] and of mammalian Ykt6 [18,19]. In mammals, the LD seems also to
play a relevant role in regulating neuronal development,
as it is crucial to the control of neurite outgrowth [20-22].
Several lines of evidence suggest LD proteins play a central
role in trafficking. Firstly, longins are the prototypical RSNAREs and are essential in eukaryotes, whereas brevins
are limited to opisthokonts and synaptobrevins are even

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/510

more limited taxonomically [23]. Secondly, the LD sensu
stricto can also be present in non-SNARE proteins: e.g.
mammals have - in addition to the SNARE longin Sec22b
- two homologous proteins, Sec22a and Sec22c, which
lack the SNARE portion but are involved in early secretory
trafficking [24]. As well, alternative splicing of the SYBL1
gene results in encoding the SNARE longin TI-VAMP/
VAMP7 and two isoforms showing reverse domain architecture: isoform ''c'' (with the regular SNARE motif but
missing the LD [15]) and isoform ''b'' (with the regular LD
but missing the SNARE motif). Finally, the longin-like
fold is not limited to members of the SNARE proteins
family but rather is shared by other important trafficking
protein families, such as the σ and μ subunits in clathrin
adaptor complexes [25], the SEDL/Trs20p subunit of the
TRAPP complex [26,27], the SRX domain of the Srα subunit of the signal recognition particle (SRP) [28,29], as
well as the CHiPS and DUF254 proteins [30]. Very
recently, the syndecan-binding protein synbindin,
involved in neuronal membrane trafficking, has been
found to show a ''special'' LD-like fold, structurally related
to SEDL and split by a loop insertion corresponding to an
atypical PDZ domain [31].
Although the three longin families (Ykt6, VAMP7 and
Sec22) have been identified in comparative genomic analyses of SNARE proteins from many eukaryotes [23], their
evolution and diversity has not been fully explored. It is
thus not entirely clear whether or not they represent
robust clades that branched before the extant eukaryotic
supergroups and whether there are any, as-yet, unreported
longin families. In order to analyze the complement of LD
proteins both in number and genomic structure, we have
undertaken a thorough bioinformatic analysis of publicly
available completed genomes from diverse eukaryotes,
with special emphasis on plant genomes, from both land
plants and algae. Trafficking in plants is not only involved
in canonical cellular processes but also in regulation of
cytokinesis, gravitropism, responses to pathogens and
abiotic stress [32]. As such, plants provide an important
handle for shedding light on the pivotal role of trafficking
in regulating (and mediating) cell function and differentiation.
Here, the three major longin families are demonstrated to
be robustly monophyletic and to each contain the diversity of eukaryotes, thus confirming that the gene duplications giving rise to these families pre-date the LCEA [6]. In
addition to the known longin families, however, our analysis has allowed the definition of a novel, plant-specific,
LD protein family, the Phytolongins. We here characterise
this family in silico in terms of genomic complement and
structure, protein domain architecture and topology and
structural modeling: this shows that a well-conserved Nterminal LD is present in members of this family, as is a

predicted C-terminal trans-membrane region. Moreover,
the unique central region of Phytolongins - showing neither detectable homology to the SNARE motif nor conservation of hydrophobic heptad repeats - is putatively able
to intramolecularly bind the longin domain through a
short, SNARE-like motif. Phylogenetic analysis pin-points
the Phytolongins as a derivative of the plant specific
VAMP72 longin family and allows elucidation of Phytolongin family evolution.

Results and discussion
Comparative genomics identifies unusual longin proteins
In order to address the evolution and diversity of longins
and LD proteins in eukaryotes, we scanned available completed genomes from across eukaryotic diversity. Our
sampling was intentionally broad and shallow in most
lineages in order to obtain a tractable dataset of LD family
proteins for analysis. This sampling included at least one
representative of each of the five eukaryotic supergroups
[33] for which genome sequences are publicly available.
However, we sampled the Plant lineage in considerable
depth. This included representatives of dicots (Arabidopsis
thaliana [34], and Populus trichocarpa [35]), monocots
(Oryza sativa [36]), moss (Physcomitrella patens [37]), as
well as the multicellular chlorophyte alga Volvox carteri(http://www.jgi.doe.gov/Volvox, 2007) and singlecelled
chlorophyte
and
prasinophyte
algae
(Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [38] and Ostreococcus tauri
[39]).

Genomes, transcriptomes and corresponding inferred
proteomes of such organisms were scanned by iterative
homology searching. Originally, we used the sequences of
all known longin proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana as
probes to scan genomes/transcriptomes/proteomes of the
organisms listed above. Homologous extracted hits were
in turn used as probes for iterative scanning steps: this
process stopped when the search resulted in extracting no
further homologous sequences. As a next step, all nonArabidopsis candidate homologues were used as blast
query sequences to be compared to Arabidopsis thaliana
longins in order to group them based on classification of
the main longin subfamilies (Ykt6, Sec22b and VAMP7)
[11] and further division of plant VAMP7 proteins in two
classes: VAMP71 and VAMP72 [40]. In accordance with
previous studies, homologues of the three major LD family proteins were identified from the vast majority of
eukaryotic genomes (Additional file 1).
The distribution and organization of the "classic" plant
longins is presented in Additional file 2. Similar to animals, algae genomes have single Ykt6 and Sec22b genes.
However, duplication of Ykt6 is conserved in all land
plants, which also show two to four Sec22b-like genes. In
plants, which indeed lack orthologues of animal brevins

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/510

[23], a progressive amplification of the VAMP7 longin
subfamily is observed [40]. We found that - in all scanned
complete genomes - the VAMP72 complement is larger
than VAMP71; moreover, the single VAMP7 gene of Ostreococcus tauri belongs to the VAMP72 group (Additional
file 2). In general, land plants show a 2-4 fold amplification of the complement of classical longins with respect to
algae: 12-18 (Physcomitrella patens, Populus trichocarpa) vs.
3-7 (Ostreococcus tauri, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) genes.
This detailed examination of the longin superfamily
organisation emphasizes the increased trafficking complexity that has accompanied the colonization of land by
the streptophytes and also allowed us to identify several
unusual plant longin proteins.
VAMP727 possesses a unique acidic loop in its longin
domain
Since Arabidopsis thaliana VAMP727 [UniProt: Q9M376]
shows an insertion of several amino acids in the LD
sequence, which is unique amongst VAMP7 proteins [41],
we performed a comparative sequence and structural
analysis of this region in plant longins. Modeling of the
LDs of Arabidopsis thaliana VAMP727 and of its closest
homologue VAMP725 [UniProt: O48850] shows that the
insertion sequence corresponds to an acidic extension of
the loop between helices α-2 and α-3 of the LD (Figure 1).
Intriguingly, this loop in the LD of Sec22b is part of a conserved interaction surface involved in binding to Sec24
within the Sec23/24/22b complex and in binding and
packaging Sec22b by COPII [PDB: 2nut] [13]. When considering that such LD-complex binding is crucial to subcellular targeting, the acidic loop is likely to mediate/
regulate the specific SCL of VAMP727 by steric hindrance
and/or polar/charge interactions. VAMP727 are present

only in seed plants (Spermatophyta) [41]. In more
ancient divisions of streptophytes (e.g. Coniferophyta,
Gnetophyta) the polar loop is already apparent; however,
it is shorter and less acidic than in flowering plants (Magnoliophyta). It is particularly well conserved in Magnoliids, Monocotyledons and Eudicotyledons (Additional file
3).
Plants possess non-SNARE longin proteins
A few non-SNARE LD proteins have been reported,
including mammalian Sec22 gene isoforms Sec22a and
Sec22c [11,24]; we report here that plants also have nonSNARE Sec22 genes. A Sec22-like rice protein [UniProt:
Q6UU98] - confirmed by FLcDNA [GenBank: AK240832]
and by ESTs [GenBank: AK240832, CB632349 and
AU057789] - shows a complete LD sequence but lacks
both the SNARE motif and the C-terminal TMD. When
comparing the transcript to the corresponding genomic
sequence (Chromosome 8), it is clear that this results
from genomic deletion of the region encoding the SNARE
motif in Sec22 paralogues. Although the exon encoding
the TMD is conserved, this domain is lost because of a
frame shift resulting from the new exon-intron boundary.
Hence this Sec22-like protein from rice is expected to correspond to a longin domain, with no further regions. This
is not surprising, when considering that single-domain
proteins based on the longin fold (e.g. σ adaptin, SEDL)
are known to play important roles in trafficking multisubunit complexes.

Identification and primary structure of the Phytolongins
Overall, our comparative genomic survey identified several unusual aspects of longin proteins in plants. However
most surprisingly, in addition to members of the three
well-known longin families, land plant genomes encode a
family of previously unreported LD proteins which based on in silico characterization (see below) - were
named "Phytolongins". A first set of Phytolongins was
originally identified using VAMP7 sequences from each
species as sequence probes. Extracted hits, used as probes
in iterated search cycles, allowed for the identification of
further homologous sequences. Phytolongins share, with
all longins, the N-terminal LD sequence and, with
VAMP7-like and Sec22b-like longins, the C-terminus.
Topology and TMD predictions (see methods), as well as
presence of highly conserved residues in the C-terminus
identify a putative TMD, suggesting that most probably
Phytolongins are integral membrane proteins sharing
topology with longins.

However, the R-SNARE motif of longins is replaced in all
Phytolongins by a central region (PhyL region) of
unknown function consisting of roughly 60-90 amino
acids (Figure 2). When using whole Phytolongin
sequences or sequence fragments corresponding to their
PhyL regions as probes to scan non-redundant protein or
DNA sequence databases, no similarity to either SNARE
motifs or any other domain was found. Further attempts,
performed optimizing BLAST parameters in order to
extract weakly similar sequences, confirmed that PhyL
sequences are unique and specific to Phytolongins. Moreover, all homology searches confirmed the absence of

Ykt6 does not have a CTD region, with a lipid attachment (diamond) while the others possess a transmembrane domain
(TMD-red cylinder).

Phytolongin orthologues in organisms other than land
plants.
In order to assess the conservation of genomic organisation of the plant longins, comparison of genomic structures (i.e. exon-intron splitting of paralogues and
orthologues) was performed, with the verified genomic
structure of each longin gene from the scanned complete
plant genomes determined by comparing genomic vs.
cDNA sequence. Figure 3 illustrates conservation and variation of gene splitting patterns in plant longins. Colorcoding in the figure emphasizes that some exon patterns
between land plants and algae are better conserved in
some longin subfamilies than in others. For example, in
land plants, a four-exon pattern is fully conserved in all
VAMP71 genes (i.e. in both paralogues and orthologues),
whereas the single VAMP71 genes from algae show a different eight-exon pattern and do not share exon-intron
junctions with land plant orthologues. Similarly, all Ykt6
genes from land plants share the same six-exon pattern,
which is quite different from the mono/bi-exonic pattern
of algae genes. Sec22 genes from land plants show a conserved gene-splitting organization (except for the nonSNARE Sec22 gene described above); however, the three-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/510

exon organization of their 3' halves (roughly encoding
SNARE motif and TMD) is conserved also in algae. The
picture of VAMP72 gene organisation is more complex:
most land plant genes show a five-exon division of the
coding sequences, but three VAMP72 genes are
monoexonic in moss and one of the Arabidopsis thaliana
VAMP72 genes shows merging of the last two exons (yellow and grey in figure 3). Comparison with algal VAMP72
genes shows conservation of some splitting points: for
instance, division between first (light green) and second
(pale red) exon. Deeper sequence comparison confirms
conservation also in splice junction sequence boundaries.
Two of the three longins of Ostreococcus tauri are
monoexonic, and the third is biexonic. Finally, the Phytolongin genes are monoexonic in both dicots and monocots (this was confirmed by extending the analysis to
Phytolongins from further species as well), whereas moss
Phytolongins are biexonic. Overall this analysis confirmed transcription of several, but not all, predicted
genes and identified novel, unreported gene structures. It
also confirmed expression of Phytolongins from four
plant taxa, validating the predicted genes.

Domain architecture of the Phytolongins
Since the profile for the LD [PROSITE: PS50859] was
detected in several, but not all Phytolongin sequences,
structural modeling of both profile-positive and profilenegative Phytolongins was performed.

Figure 4 shows a model of the putative LD of a representative Arabidopsis thaliana Phytolongin [UniProt: Q9SN26].
Homology modeling was performed using Geno3D [42];
as a template, the NMR structure of human TI-VAMP/
VAMP7 LD [PDB: 2dmw] was found to be better than LD
structures from either Sec22b [PDB: 1ifq] or Ykt6p [PDB:
1h8m]. Intriguingly, structural variation was found in the
α1 side of the LD, which is involved in intramolecular
binding to the SNARE motif in both Ykt6p [12] and
Sec22b [13].
In order to obtain a model including both the LD and
PhyL regions, whole Phytolongins were used as sequence
probes in fold recognition based modeling. Phyre [43,44]
confirmed that the LD of TI-VAMP/VAMP7 LD is the best
available template for a Phytolongin LD; in addition however, it was also able to propose a model superimposed
onto the structure of subunit Sec22b of the COPII complex recently solved [PDB: 2nup, chain c] [13]. In particular, the model in figure 5a shows that a short peptide from
the PhyL region (magenta) is close to the α1-β3 region
(blue) of the LD, i.e. to the SNARE-binding site [12,13].
Threading predictions were iterated and the presence of
the putative LD binding motif was confirmed for the PhyL
regions of all Phytolongins (data not shown). When considering that the α1-β3 region is also a binding partner for
the SNARE-like region of Hrb [14], it is not surprising to
see that the putative LD-binding peptides of the PhyL
regions are aligned in the model to the LD binding motif

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/510

of the template and that the putative interaction is based
on polar rather than hydrophobic interactions (Figure 5,
panels b and c). Figure 5c also shows that the NT half of
the PhyL region, including its putative LD binding motif,
shares with SNARE motifs some heptadic, hydrophobic
layers (whereas the CT half does not - data not shown).
Absence of overall homology to the SNARE motif, presence of a putative LD-binding motif and conservation of
the heptadic layers only in the NT half suggest that the
PhyL region might share with the SNARE motif capacity to
bind the LD, but not to participate in SNARE bundles,
thus resembling the SNARE-like region of Hrb [14].
The PhyL region is likely to have strongly diverged from
the SNARE motif by point mutations and/or sequence
insertions. High divergence between the PhyL region and
SNARE motif, together with α1 sequence divergence
between Phytolongins and longins LDs suggest that different longin domain proteins may show different binding
properties. Indeed, even among SNARE longins from the
same organism - e.g. yeast - the intramolecular binding
mechanism can be either clearly apparent (Ykt6p [12]) or
not detected (Nyv1p [45]). Putative binding of the PhyL
region to the LD is in agreement with evidence that nonSNARE proteins can also bind the LD [14,15].
In order to obtain further functional predictions, PhyL
region sequences from all identified Phytolongins were
scanned for the presence of PROSITE motifs/signatures
(see methods for details). When searching for degenerate
patterns, putative calcium binding regions were consistently found (data not shown) but no positional conservation of these putative sites in multiple alignment was
observed. While false positives among degenerate versions of low complexity motifs are quite common, this
low confidence prediction is reported because of the special significance of calcium binding in trafficking proteins
[46].
Overall, the domain modeling shows that, despite no
detectable sequence homology with SNARE motifs, Phytolongins are bona fide longin proteins with conserved
longin domain structure and a potentially conserved
binding mechanism between the LD and PhyL motif.

and superimposition representations were obtained using
PyMOL.

Evolution of the Phytolongins
Having established that the Phytolongins are LD proteins,
we wanted to establish the longin family from which they
are derived. A variety of datasets were created to address
this question and were analysed using Bayesian and two
methods of protein maximum-likelihood phylogeny. Initial analyses of longins from diverse eukaryotes clearly
resolve the Phytolongins as a monophyletic group to the
exclusion of all other sequences. The overall analysis
(Additional file 4) did not resolve the placement of this

clade but did resolve the Ykt6 sequences as monophyletic
(0.99/92/90 posterior probabilities/PhyML/RAxML bootstrap support, respectively) indicating that the Phytolongins are not derived from within this family. Subsequent
analysis further excluded the Sec22 family as a source of
the Phytolongins, with a strongly supported node resolving the Sec22 family and allowing the establishment of
the Phytolongins as embedded within the plant specific
VAMP72 clade (Figure 6).

In order to further investigate the internal evolution of the
Phytolongin family, a final dataset was analysed (Figure
7). Independent clades of Phytolongins were observed in
the bryophytes (Physcomitrella patens), gymnosperms
(Pinus taeda) and the angiosperms. Although the node
separating the bryophytes from the other plant Phytolongins is poorly resolved in figure 7, subsequent analyses
provided more robust support (Additional file 5-1.00/56/
80). Within the angiosperms, two major clades are apparent. Although the inclusion of the monocot sequences in

these clades is unclear, the nodes supporting the dicot
sequences in each clade are very well supported (Figure 7).

anism resulting in a closed conformation in the conformational epitope mediating subcellular targeting.

Figure 8 illustrates our hypothesis of Phytolongin evolution. The ancestor of streptophytes possessed a single Phytolongin gene, as did the ancestor of tracheophytes with
subsequent independent gene family expansions in the
descendent lineages. It is difficult to deduce whether the
duplication giving rise to the two major clades of
angiosperm Phytolongins predates the separation of
monocots and dicots. However, based on the observed
topology, this appears to be the best-supported scenario.
Nonetheless, with the two well-resolved clades of rosid
Phytolongins, it is clear that the duplication had already
occurred at this point (Figure 8). Further expansion of the
Phytolongin gene families are also observed in the Populus
trichocarpa and Arabidopsis thaliana genomes, as well as in
the ancestor of Sorghum bicolor and Oryza sativa.

While the VAMP71 homologues are localized to the Golgi
body and vacuole, all VAMP72 proteins localise to the
PM/endosomal compartment [17], apart from VAMP723
(ER [17]) and VAMP727 (prevacuolar compartment
[41]). Since the Phytolongins share higher similarity with
the VAMP72 family, we tentatively speculate that the Phytolongins might be involved in events at the PM/endosomes as well. However, given that multiple linear and
often short, cryptic motifs and conformational epitopes,
as well as binding partners and post-translational modifications, can finely tune subcellular sorting, experimental
evidence is expected to shed light on the SCL, interactions
and role in trafficking of this novel protein family.

Putative involvement of Phytolongins in subcellular
trafficking
Preliminary data from subcellular location prediction
software applied to the Arabidopsis thaliana Phytolongins
gave results inconsistent between the different algorithms
and, for the Arabidopsis thaliana VAMPs, results inconsistent with experimentally established location of the proteins (data not shown). Consequently this method of
analysis was not pursued. Nonetheless, it is possible to
speculate on the possible SCL of Phytolongins and their
involvement in plant subcellular trafficking based on their
similarity and derivation from the plant specific clade of
VAMP72 proteins.

We performed an analysis of percent identity between the
animal TI-VAMP/VAMP7, Arabidopsis thaliana VAMP
homologues and the four Arabidopsis Phytolongins, considering (i) the full-length sequence, (ii) the LD region
only and (iii) the CT region only (i.e. the SNARE motif/
Phyl region + TMD). Animal VAMP7 proteins are more
similar to the four VAMP71 than to the seven VAMP72
and, intriguingly, such difference is dependent on divergence at the LD sequence. In the CT region, the VAMP71
and VAMP72 share a range in similarity to the animal
homologues between 38-42%, as do LDs from animal
VAMP7 to plant VAMP71 LDs. However, similarity
between the animal TI-VAMP/VAMP7 and VAMP72 LDs is
roughly ten percent lower (31 to 34). It is therefore noteworthy that all four Phytolongins LDs are more similar to
LDs from VAMP72 proteins than LDs from VAMP71. It
has to be stressed here that subcellular targeting of longins
is mediated by the LD [12-19], acting as a dominant signal
in chimeric constructs combining domains from VAMP7
proteins with different SCL [17] Moreover, in addition to
a similar LD, VAMP72 proteins and Phytolongins are
likely to share a conserved intramolecular binding mech-

Conclusion
Our bioinformatic analysis of longin proteins has both
verified the ancient nature of the three R-SNARE longin
subfamilies and identified the Phytolongins, a previously
undescribed LD protein family, specific to plants. That
Phytolongins are present in multiple plant genomes,
spanning the diversity of land plants, and that Phytolongin transcripts are available from several plant EST
projects speak to the validity of the predicted novel genes.
The expanded nature of this gene family in many taxa
speaks to its potential importance in plant biology.
In addition to this new family of non-SNARE longin proteins, we identified several splice-variants of canonical
longins, missing the SNARE motif. These, together with
the presence of other non-SNARE longin proteins, and the
conserved longin-like fold in a variety of other trafficking
proteins, all suggest that the longin domain may be a
more central structural feature to membrane-trafficking in
eukaryotic cells than is currently recognised. Since the
longin-like fold is present in diverse trafficking machinery, involved in vesicle fusion, vesicle formation and even
the signal recognition particle, we propose that the
longin-like domain should join other prominent structural protein elements, such as the alpha-solenoid, and
beta-propeller domains [47] and monomeric GTPases, in
the list of the primordial building blocks that were
involved in the earliest evolution of a eukaryotic membrane-trafficking system.

Methods
Genome scanning and analysis
Genome-wide searches were performed using BLAST [48]
with default scoring parameters and excluding the filter
for low-complexity regions. Both nucleotide, protein and
translated BLAST programs were used to search for
homologous genes, transcripts or proteins at both the
NCBI and EBI databases as well as at the JGI genome por-

Figure 6
Phylogeny of Sec22b, VAMP7 and Phytolongins
Phylogeny of Sec22b, VAMP7 and Phytolongins. This figure demonstrates that Phytolongins are most likely derived from
within the VAMP72 clade of plants. The Phytolongins (PL) and Sec22b clades are denoted by vertical bars. In this, and all subsequent phylogenetic figures, the best Bayesian topology is shown, with support values for resolved nodes in the order of posterior probabilities, PhyML bootstrap values and RAxML bootstrap values. Values are not provided for nodes supported by less
than 0.80 posterior probability and 50% bootstrap support by both methods. For some well-supported nodes, values are
replaced by symbols with closed circles denoting better than 1.00/95/95 and open circles denoting better than 0.95/80/80 support.

Figure 7
Phylogenetic analysis of the Phytolongin family
Phylogenetic analysis of the Phytolongin family. This figure shows the results of an analysis of Phytolongin sequences
with selected plant VAMP7 homologues as outgroups. The small inner vertical bars denote the clades of Populus trichocarpa and
Arabidopsis thaliana expansions. The middle vertical bars denote the well-supported rosid-specific expansions while the outer
vertical bars denote the clades of angiosperm, gymnosperm and bryophyte Phytolongins respectively.
tal http://genome.jgi-psf.org/. Searches vs. complete, non
redundant NCBI and EBI databases were performed limiting organism to Eukaryota (taxid:2759); at the same time,
several searches at the JGI portal were limited to specific
model organisms.
Evidence regarding the conservation and variation of the
intron/exon structure was obtained using available transcripts (FLcDNAs and/or ESTs) from EBI, NCBI and JGI
databases as sequence queries in BLAST searches vs.
genomic scaffolds. Alignment of transcript regions to
genomic sequences provided a preliminary exon map of
each gene. The map was then manually curated and opti-

mized comparing corresponding translated protein fragments and taking into account splice consensus
sequences.
Protein sequence analysis and structural predictions
Scanning of canonical PROSITE motifs and signatures was
performed using the ScanProsite tool [49] available at the
ExPAsy server http://www.expasy.org, whereas scanning
for degenerate patterns was performed using PROSITE
scan available on-line at the IBCP-PBIL server http://npsapbil.ibcp.fr and allowing for 2 mismatches or setting for
65% similarity.

In all analyses, the model of sequence evolution was
established using the program Prot-test V. 1.3 [56]. Datasets were then processed using three methods of protein
phylogenetic analysis. The optimal topology and Bayesian
posterior probability values were obtained using Mr.
Bayes version 3.1.2 [57] with two independent runs each
of 1000000 generations. The burnin value was estimated
graphically and all trees prior to the plateau were excluded
from the consensus. In all cases the splits frequency was
below 0.1 indicating that the two runs had converged.
Protein Maximum Likelihood (ML) bootstrap support
values were calculated using PHYML [58] and RAxML [59]
with the appropriate models of sequence evolution and
correction for variation of rates among sites. Phylogenetic
analyses were performed on the CamGrid cluster at the
University of Cambridge or the bioinfo cluster at the University of Alberta.
Figure of
History 8 the Phytolongin longin family
History of the Phytolongin longin family. This cartoon
illustrates the proposed evolutionary history of the Phytolongins including the genesis of the proteins at the base of the
streptophytes (green radial) and subsequent gene duplications in the various lineages giving rise to the expanded Phytolongin complements (blue radials). The brown radial prior
to the separation of the monocots and dicots denotes that,
although we hypothesize a gene duplication at that point, the
phylogeny is not robustly supported.

Abbreviations used

Prediction of TMD and topology was performed using
PSORT
[50],
DAS
[51],
TMPRED
http://
www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html,
SOSUI [52] and HMMTOP [53].

Authors' contributions

Homology modeling and superposition of models to templates was performed using the Geno3D tool available online
at
the
IBCP-PBIL
server
http://geno3dpbil.ibcp.fr[42]. Fold recognition was performed using
Phyre [43,44,54]. 3D representation of molecular structures was obtained using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics
System http://www.pymol.org.
Phylogenetic analysis
Sequences were aligned initially using Clustal X [55] and
then adjusted manually based on known secondary structural features of the predicted longin domain. For phylogenetic analysis only regions of unambiguous homology
were retained. For all datasets, details of taxon numbers,
positions and models of sequence evolution are listed in
Additional file 6. All alignments are available upon
request and a list of abbreviations and accession numbers
for all sequences used in the analyses is provided in Additional file 1.

CT: carboxy (C)-terminal; FLcDNA: full-length cDNA;
LCEA: last common eukaryotic ancestor; LD: Longin
domain; NT: amino (N)-terminal; PDZ: PSD95: DlgA and

(NSF) attachment protein (SNAP) receptor; SRP: signal
recognition particle; TI-VAMP: tetanus neurotoxin insensitive VAMP; TMD: transmembrane domain; TRAPP:

MV collected the dataset for the analysis, performed structural modeling and some of the phylogenetic analyses. VR
participated in data mining and performed the genomic
structure analyses. JBD conceived of and supervised the
phylogenetic analyses, as well as performed the analyses
on the Phytolongin-specific dataset. FF initiated and coordinated the work and participated in the structural modeling and sequence analyses. All authors have read and
approved of the final manuscript.

Alignment of the VAMP727 loop region in diverse plants. This figure
shows a multiple alignment of the conserved VAMP727 acidic loop region
including a few adjacent C-ter and N-ter residues, corresponding to
regions 94-121 or 96-124 of VAMP727 proteins from respectively Arabidopsis thaliana or Oryza sativa. Loops regions are 98-116 (At) and
100-119 (Os) respectively.

Longin phylogeny. This figure demonstrates that the Phytolongins form a
well-resolved clade within the longin family and that they are unlikely to
have been derived from within the Ykt6 clade of longins. The vertical bars
highlight the Ykt6 and Phytolongin (PL) clades respectively.

Phytolongin phylogeny (altered taxon sampling). This figure shows the
robust separation of bryophyte and gymno/angiosperm sequences. This
dataset included a homologue from Salaginella moellendorffii but
excluded a divergent sequence from Sorghum bicolor and resulted in a
more robust resolution of the Physcomitrella patens sequences from the
other plant Phytolongins (vertical bar).
