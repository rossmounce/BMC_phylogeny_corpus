Abstract
Background: Fungi can undergo autophagic- or apoptotic-type programmed cell death (PCD) on
exposure to antifungal agents, developmental signals, and stress factors. Filamentous fungi can also
exhibit a form of cell death called heterokaryon incompatibility (HI) triggered by fusion between
two genetically incompatible individuals. With the availability of recently sequenced genomes of
Aspergillus fumigatus and several related species, we were able to define putative components of
fungi-specific death pathways and the ancestral core apoptotic machinery shared by all fungi and
metazoa.
Results: Phylogenetic profiling of HI-associated proteins from four Aspergilli and seven other
fungal species revealed lineage-specific protein families, orphan genes, and core genes conserved
across all fungi and metazoa. The Aspergilli-specific domain architectures include NACHT family
NTPases, which may function as key integrators of stress and nutrient availability signals. They are
often found fused to putative effector domains such as Pfs, SesB/LipA, and a newly identified
domain, HET-s/LopB. Many putative HI inducers and mediators are specific to filamentous fungi and
not found in unicellular yeasts. In addition to their role in HI, several of them appear to be involved
in regulation of cell cycle, development and sexual differentiation. Finally, the Aspergilli possess
many putative downstream components of the mammalian apoptotic machinery including several
proteins not found in the model yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Conclusion: Our analysis identified more than 100 putative PCD associated genes in the
Aspergilli, which may help expand the range of currently available treatments for aspergillosis and
other invasive fungal diseases. The list includes species-specific protein families as well as conserved
core components of the ancestral PCD machinery shared by fungi and metazoa.

of invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients

and it can also cause asthma, allergies, and mycotoxicosis

A. niger, and A. nidulans can also cause diseases in
humans, animals and plants all over the world [2].
Despite the medical and agricultural importance of this
genus, limited antifungal therapies are available due to
high toxicity, low efficacy rates, and growing drug resistance [3]. Activation of endogenous programmed cell
death (PCD) reactions is a promising approach to combat
invasive aspergillosis and other fungal diseases. Several
antifungal agents including amphotericin B and rapamycin have been shown to induce cell death cascades in filamentous fungi [4-7]. Better understanding of these
pathways might provide the basis for the development of
novel anti-fungal therapeutics against aspergillosis and
give further insights into evolution of programmed cell
death in the eukaryotic cell.
Several different cell death programs seem to exist in parallel in fungi and often resemble mammalian apoptosis
and yeast autophagy [8-11]. The best studied form of programmed cell death in filamentous fungi is heterokaryon
incompatibility (HI) that can be triggered by cellular
fusions between hyphae of incompatible individuals during vegetative growth or between incompatible germlings
during the establishment of fungal colonies [12]. These
fusion between two individuals with incompatible het
(heterokaryon incompatibility) loci triggers the HI reaction characterized by growth inhibition, repression of
asexual sporulation, hyphal compartmentation and death
in the heterokaryotic cell [13,14]. Although HI is ubiquitous in filamentous fungi, its biological significance and
evolutionary origin is still unknown. It has been proposed
to serve as a self/nonself recognition system responsible
for limiting genetic exchange and horizontal transfer of
cytoplasmic infectious elements [15-17]. Coincidentally,
one of the HI inducers in P. anserina is a prion capable of
infectious propagation [18].
Much of what is known about the underlying mechanisms of programmed cell death in fungi comes from only
three species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, P. anserina and N.
crassa. With the availability of the newly sequenced

genomes of A. nidulans (J. Galagan et al., in press), A.
oryzae (M. Machida et al., in press), A. fumigatus Af293 (W.
Nierman et al., in press), and N. fischeri (W. Nierman,
unpublished) we were able to identify their putative PCD
effectors and mediators. In this study, we applied a
BLASTp-plus-phylogeny reconstruction approach to survey the Aspergillus spp. genomes for homologs of characterized programmed cell death proteins from fungi and
animals. Several fungi-specific families as well as components of the core cell death machinery shared by filamentous fungi and metazoan were identified.

Results and discussion
Inducers of HI-triggered PCD
Several components of the HI reaction encoded by the het
genes, the HI suppressor genes, and the HI-induced genes
have been characterized at the molecular level in P. anserina and N. crassa. In natural populations of P. anserina, N.
crassa and Cryphonectria parasitica, the functional het genes
exist as two or more polymorphic alleles conferring alternative specificities [19-22]. Different loci may be responsible for triggering the HI reaction in these two and other
fungal species. Heterocomplex formation between alternative het gene products is thought be a common theme
in nonself recognition during allelic and non-allelic HI
[23,24]. One of the genetically (and potentially physically) interacting partners is often a HET domain protein
[15] that may interact with well-conserved proteins playing important roles in development and differentiation
(Dementhon
and
L.
Glass,
unpublished).

Although at least eight loci have been implicated in HI in
A. nidulans [25], none of them has been characterized at
the molecular level. To identify putative HI-associated
proteins in the Aspergilli, we first searched completely
sequenced fungal genomes using known inducers and
mediators of heterokaryon incompatibility as BLASTp
queries. We examined the domain composition and
phyletic distribution of the BLASTp hits and built phylogenetic trees for several protein families. We also applied
domain fusion analysis to several so called Rosetta Stone

proteins with unusual domain composition to infer protein domain interactions and functional linkage between
putative HI-associated proteins identified in the Aspergilli
proteomes.
HET-C2 proteins
Our database BLASTp searches identified orthologs of P.
anserina HET-C2 [26], in all filamentous fungal genomes
sequenced to date (Table 1). The family also has a high
level of sequence conservation and wide phyletic distribution in other taxa. HET-C2 orthologs are found in several
Saccharomycetes, including Debaryomyces hansenii and
Kluyveromyces lactis, (Fig. 1). Yet no homologs are detected
in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, suggesting a gene loss in some
yeast lineages. HET-C2 homologs are also present in most
animals and plants.

The high level of conservation among the HET-C2 family
members is consistent with the important role these proteins may play in the glycosphingolipid and sphingosine
metabolism and possibly in regulation of cellular stress
responses. HET-C2 shows significant similarity to human
GLTP [27] and Arabidopsis thaliana ACD11 [28] proteins,
which catalyze the intermembrane transfer of glycosphingolipids and sphingosines, respectively. ACD11 has also
been shown to function in PCD and pathogen defense in
plants. In Aspergilli, sphingosines have been also shown to
induce an apoptosis-like PCD [4] and to affect cell cycle
progression [29]. P. anserina HET-C2 was proposed to act
as a glycolipid metabolite sensor in addition to its role in
glycolipid transfer, regulation of ascospore maturation,
and triggering HI [26,30]. The high level of sequence conservation in this family, suggests that the role of HET-C2
orthologs in the Aspergilli PCD pathway is likely to be
similar.
HET-C proteins
Further analysis showed that all Aspergillus species have
direct orthologs of N. crassa HET-C [31] and its close
homolog of unknown function (Table 1). The phylogenetic tree has a bipartite division resulting from an early
gene duplication event predating the separation of Eurotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes (Fig. 2). HET-C is orthologous to A. nidulans HetC and homologous to TinC [32].
The HET-C domain is found in many ascomycetes and
basidiomycete species, but surprisingly in only one yeast
species, Yarrowia lipolytica, which clusters together with
HET-C homologs from basidiomycete species. Unexpectedly, a partial HET-C domain is also present in several epiphytic and symbiotic bacteria including two gammaproteobacteria,
Pseudomonas
syringae
[GenBank:
AAY39263 and GenBank: AAO58004], a cyanobacterium,
Nostoc punctiforme [GenBank: ZP_00106220], and an
actinomycete of the genus Frankia [GenBank:
ZP_00567177]. The phylogenetic tree of the conserved N-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/177

terminal portion of HET-C shows that the bacterial proteins form a coherent clade with a long branch connecting
it to the rest of the tree. We had to exclude the Nostoc punctiforme protein from the phylogenetic analysis because it
was too divergent, but it also showed more similarity to
the bacterial proteins.
Based on the current tree topology, the origin of the bacterial homologs is not clear. It can be attributed to vertical
inheritance from the last common ancestor between bacteria and fungi followed by massive gene loss in most bacterial and yeast lineages. Alternatively, it can be explained
by horizontal transfer of the ancestral het-C gene from epiphytic fungi followed by rapid divergence in bacteria. In
the latter case, the gene must have persisted in bacterial
populations by conferring a selective advantage to the
recipients. Since heterologous expression of an N. crassa
het-C allele was also shown to trigger an HI-like growth
defect in P. anserina [21], the het-C homologs in P. syringae
or related species may induce growth inhibition in epiphytic filamentous fungi and thus facilitate substrate
defense.
N. crassa polypeptides encoded by the het-C alleles of
alternative specificity were shown to form a heterocomplex localized to the plasma membrane during the HI
reaction [23]. It has a putative signal peptide, a conserved
HET-C domain and a divergent C-terminal glycine-rich
region, often found in extracellular glycoproteins. The
biological role of the HetC proteins in the Aspergilli is
unknown. A. nidulans TinC has been shown to stabilize
the NimA mitotic kinase required for mitotic entry [32].
A. nidulans strains lacking tinC displayed cold and osmotic
sensitivity and overexpression of its truncated form produced growth inhibition, defects in nuclear envelope fission and cell cycle [32]. It is unlikely that either protein
triggers the HI reaction in the A. nidulans. Moreover, het-C
may not act as a bona fide het gene in other fungal species,
since no het-C polymorphism was observed in A. flavus (K.
Ehrlich and P. Cotty, unpublished), A. nidulans [32], and
P. anserina [21] isolates. Nonetheless, expression of the N.
crassa het-c(PA) allele triggers a growth inhibition similar
to the HI reaction in P. anserina. If N. crassa HET-C has a
similar role to TinC, it may explain the growth inhibition
effects caused by expression of N. crassa (and possibly bacterial) het-c in P. anserina [21].
HET domain proteins
HET domain [15,33] proteins were identified using the
HMMer package as described in Methods. Unlike the
ubiquitous HET-C2 family, the HET domain appears to be
limited to filamentous ascomycetes and is not detected in
yeasts or basidiomycete species (Table 1). In the
Aspergilli, the number of HET domain proteins varies
from seven in N. fischeri to 38 in A. oryzae. The tree topol-

ogy delineates multiple duplication events in filamentous
ascomycetes species followed by rapid diversification and
gene loss in several Aspergillus spp. (data not shown).
Orthologous relationships within this Aspergillus family
are difficult to establish, except for a subfamily of HET and
Ankyrin domain proteins, which appear to be related by
direct vertical descent (data not shown).
The HET domain expansion in filamentous ascomycetes
may represent a niche adaptation strategy to process a
large number of similar stimuli associated with defense
against pathogens, self/nonself recognition, differentiation, or analogous roles. It is found in N. crassa HET-6 and
TOL and in P. anserina HET-D and HET-E, and so appears
to be critical to the HI reaction in both species (for review
see [15]). In P. anserina HET-D and HET-E, HET domains
are followed by a NACHT domain and multiple WD

repeats, while N. crassa proteins contain a coiled-coil
domain and LRR repeats, instead (see Figure 3). In addition to HET-6 and TOL, N. crassa has about 50 other HET
domain proteins, whose role in the HI reaction if any is as
yet unknown.
Identification of the HET-s/LopB domain
Initial BLASTp searches using the P. anserina HET-s
sequence [34] as a query revealed homologs in A. nidulans, P. chrysogenum, M. grisea, N. crassa and G. zeae (Table
1). Iterative PSI-BLAST searches identified a new domain
that includes more proteins from the same species plus a
pathogenicity protein, LopB, from the Dothideomycete
fungus Leptosphaeria maculans [35]. For LopB and most
other members of this family, sequence similarity is limited to the N-terminal globular domain of HET-s (Fig. 4)
[36]. Two members from A. nidulans and N. crassa have an

adjacent NACHT domain (described below) at the N- and
C-terminus, respectively.
As mentioned earlier, HI was proposed to act as a self/
nonself recognition system responsible for limiting the
spread of numerous infectious elements in natural populations [15-17]. Coincidentally, HET-s prion behaves as a
non-conventional infectious element capable of propagation during anastomosis and sexual reproduction in P.
anserina [37]. HET-s can exist in two forms: as a normal
protein [18] and as an infectious prion [38], capable of
propagating as a self-perpetuating amyloid aggregate
[18,36]. Its rather unexpected similarity to LopB implies
that members of the family may have another function
unrelated to HI. Although its specific role in L. maculans is
unknown, LopB- mutants showed impaired ability to form
lesions on oilseed rape [35]. LopB contains a predicted
signal peptide suggesting that it is secreted and might con-

tribute to the L. maculans pathogenicity by compromising
host membranes. The fusions between HET-s/LopB and
NACHT domain in N. crassa and A. nidulans suggests that,
in other species, proteins containing one of these two
domains may physically interact.
STAND domain proteins
Using P. anserina HET-E as a BLASTp query, we identified
several proteins containing NACHT domain in the
Aspergilli and other filamentous ascomycetes. Further
HMMer searches detected two Aspergillus-specific expansions of the STAND domain [39]: NACHT NTPases and
NB-ARC ATPases (Table 1). These NTP-binding proteins
are often linked to various protein-binding modules such
as WD40, Ankyrin or TPR at the C-terminus and a highly
divergent nucleoside phosphorylase (Pfs) domain at their
N-terminus (Fig. 3). A different type of domain composition is found in several other STAND NTPases. NB-ARC

within the two STAND domain expansions are difficult to

establish since the proteins are highly divergent and
exhibit uneven phyletic distribution. They also appear to
have undergone multiple domain shuffling events as well
as lineage-specific gene loss and expansions during the

evolution of the Aspergilli as well as other filamentous
fungi.
As mentioned earlier, one of N. crassa NACHT domain
protein is linked to the HET-s/LopB domain. P. anserina
HET-D and HET-E are fused to the HET domain and 11
WD40 repeats, which determine their allelic specificity
[41]. HET-E has been shown to genetically (and potentially physically) interact with HET-C2 to trigger incompatibility in P. anserina suggesting that the interaction may
activate the ceramide stress response pathway [24]. Similar to the HET domain expansion, the two STAND domain
expansions may represent a niche adaptation strategy in
filamentous ascomycetes. The multiple fusions involving
STAND domains in filamentous fungi may be responsible
for the enhancement of their repertoire of signal-transducing interactions, linking preexisting signaling pathways,
or integrating multiple signals.
Although their specific biological role is unknown, several
functional inferences can be made regarding the role of
the STAND domain proteins in the Aspergilli. Despite the
variability of their domain architecture, the regulatory/signaling function of STAND NTPases seems to be conserved
from fungi to man to possibly bacteria. The domain has
been implicated in hetero-oligomerization and signal
transduction during apoptosis, inflammatory and pathogen responses in animals and plants, and in transcriptional regulation of secondary metabolism in bacteria
[42-44]. Similar to their fungal counterparts, animal and
plant members of the superfamily tend to be fused to
death effector domains at the N-terminus and to repetitive
protein binding/regulatory modules at the C-terminus
[39].
Other observations suggest that Pfs and STAND domain
fusion proteins in the Aspergilli may play a regulatory or
signaling role. In plants, the Pfs domain was found in several stress-inducible enzymes [42]. The Pfs domain is also

found in bacterial methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine (MTA/SAH) nucleosidases and phosphoribosyltransferases [45]. The bacterial nucleosidases function
in methionine salvage pathway and control intracellular
levels of MTA/SAH and, in several cases, production of a
quorum-sensing signaling molecule [46]. In animals,
MTA has been shown to affect many critical responses
including regulation of gene expression, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis [47].
The NB-ARC and LipA as well as NACHT and HET-s/LopB
domain fusion proteins may function as bistable switches
in signaling cascades. A putative serine esterase domain,
LipA, is found in the SesB protein implicated in bistability
of developmental signaling cascades in Nectria haematococca [40]. Incidentally, sesB is adjacent to a gene, which
encodes a NACHT and Ankyrin domain protein. HET-s is
also associated with bistability of the HI reaction resulting
from the spread of the infectious prion in P. anserina [38].
Another line of evidence implicating this family in integration of developmental, stress, and nutrient availability
signals, comes from expression data. At least five NACHT
domain proteins appear to be regulated by LaeA in A.
fumigatus (N. Keller, S. Kim and W. Nierman, unpublished), a putative chromatin-dependent regulator of secondary metabolism, virulence and conidiation [48,49]. A
few other putative PCD-associated proteins seem to be
affected by LaeA in A. fumigatus, including both metacaspases, bZIP transcription factor JlbA, BAX Inhibitor family
protein, Cu2+/Zn2+ superoxide dismutase SOD1, histone
chaperone ASF1, and AMID-like mitochondrial oxidoreductase, some of which are described below.
Mediators of HI-triggered PCD
In addition to the putative HI inducers, the Aspergilli possess homologs of HI suppressors from P. anserina and N.
crassa (Table 2) [15]. Thus, sequence similarity searches
detected orthologs of N. crassa VIB-1 [50] and P. anserina

MOD-A, MOD-D and MOD-E [51-53]. VIB-1, a putative
regulator of conidiation and HI in N. crassa, is orthologous to Penicillium chrysogenum PhoG and A. nidulans
PacG, which were annotated as putative non-repressible
acid phosphatases via transformation experiments
[50,54,55]. There is no apparent orthologs in yeasts,
although, VIB-1 is a distant homolog of the Ndt80p transcription factor from S. cerevisiae [56]. The distribution of
MOD-A orthologs also appears to be limited to filamentous ascomycetes. Only A. oryzae, but not other Aspergilli,
contains an ortholog of MOD-A, implicated in ascomycete-specific functions such as regulation of growth arrest
during HI and female organ formation in P. anserina [51].
On the contrary, MOD-D and MOD-E display a very high
level of sequence conservation and have a much wider
phyletic distribution with homologs in all fungi and
higher eukaryotes. MOD-D, a G protein alpha subunit, is
orthologous to GpaB and GanB from A. fumigatus and A.
nidulans, respectively [57,58].

The degree of sequence conservation seems to be linked to
the relative importance of the biological function and
more conserved proteins appear to be functional
orthologs. The similarity between VIB-1 and Ndt80p, a
transcription factor involved in regulation of sporulation
and meiosis in S. cerevisiae [56], suggests that phoG and
pacG may encode a transcriptional regulators of the acid
phosphatase, rather than the enzyme itself [59]. MOD-D
and MOD-E have been shown to function as an alpha subunit of heterotrimeric G protein, and an HSP90 family
molecular chaperone, respectively [52,53]. P. anserina
MOD-E, in addition to suppressing HI, is involved in regulation of development and the sexual cycle [53,60]. The
MOD-E/HSP90 function during the sexual cycle appears
to be conserved from fungi to mammals [61]. Mammalian HSP90 family chaperones also mediate the unfolded
protein response to endoplasmic reticulum stress through
regulation of the secretory pathway, cell cycle and programmed cell death [61,62].

Besides HI suppressors, Aspergilli also possess orthologs of
P. anserina idi-2, idi-4, idi-6 and idi-7 genes (Table 2)
induced by heterokaryon incompatibility and implicated
in autophagy in response to starvation and sporulation
and in regulation of sexual differentiation [8,63-65]. IDI6 and IDI-7 proteins seem to be highly conserved across
fungal species; while IDI-2 and IDI-4 are poorly conserved
and their distribution is limited to filamentous fungi. No
detectable homologs of IDI-1 and IDI-3 are found in
Aspergilli and an IDI-2 ortholog is only present in A.
oryzae. Autophagic serine protease IDI-6 is orthologous to
A. fumigatus Alp2 that has been shown to function in regulation of sporulation as well as pathogenesis in A. fumigatus [66]. Likewise, IDI-4 an ortholog of the A. fumigatus
JlbA, a putative bZIP transcription factor induced by
amino acid starvation [67].
Many HI-associated genes have wide phyletic distribution
and are well-conserved across filamentous fungi. Some
are involved in autophagy, suggesting that the incompatibility function might have evolved by recruiting components of the cellular system controlling adaptation to
starvation [11]. In addition, cytological alterations during
HI in P. anserina are similar to those observed during starvation and treatment with rapamycin, an inhibitor of the
TOR (target of rapamycin) signaling pathway that controls autophagic degradation in S. cerevisiae [68]. Yet,
many seem to perform unrelated functions such as regulation of development or sexual differentiation, implying
that heterokaryon incompatibility may have utilized components
of
these
cell
programs
as
well.
Downstream PCD machinery
In addition to HI, filamentous fungi appear to possess a
wide range of PCD reactions triggered by various death
stimuli. In Aspergilli, the apoptotic-like phenotypes and
are observed during entry into stationary phase and
sporulation and on exposure to certain antifungal agents,

peptides, and sphingosines [4,6,7,69,70]. Similarly, in N.
crassa, morphological changes during the HI reaction,
starvation, and DNA damage response resemble apoptosis [9,10,71]. The apoptotic machinery of filamentous
fungi may share some key components with yeast and
mammalian systems. First, we looked for homologs of
apoptotic proteins in S. cerevisiae, which can undergo
PCD in response to nutritional and oxidative stresses,
plant antifungal peptides, hydrogen peroxide, or during
aging and mating [72-75].
To identify candidate apoptosis-associated proteins in the
Aspergilli, BLASTp similarity searches were performed
with yeast apoptotic proteins as queries. Homologs of
more than 30 yeast proteins were detected including metacaspases and caspase-regulating serine protease HtrA2
(Table 3). Phylogenetic analysis shows that many
Aspergillus proteins are in one-on-one orthologous relationships with S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, and basidiomycete
proteins (data not shown).
BLASTp and HMM searches identified homologs of ~50
human and mouse apoptotic proteins in the Aspergilli
[see Additional file 1 ]. Similar to yeasts, filamentous ascomycetes lack the upstream metazoan apoptotic regulators
including members of the bax/bcl-2 family and p53,
while downstream components of the apoptotic machinery appear to be shared. Interestingly, many Aspergillus
proteins are more similar to their human counterparts
such as AMID, BIR1, HtrA, and CulA, than to yeast
homologs. Thus, the tree topology of the AIF family confirmed that Aspergilli proteins are more closely related to
human AMID than to S. cerevisiae Aif1p, which clustered
together with plant homologs [see Additional file 2 ].
Moreover, homologs of several key components of the
mammalian apoptotic machinery, including AmsH and
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), are not detected in
S. cerevisiae (Table 4).

At least two Aspergilli proteins appear to be functional
homologs to their mammalian counterparts. The
enhanced PARP and caspase-like activity reported in A.
nidulans during sporulation-induced PCD is consistent
with the presence of both metacaspase-dependent and independent apoptotic pathways [70,76]. In addition, the
metacaspase-independent apoptosis pathway was shown
to operate in A. fumigatus during stationary phase and
treatment with fungicidal sphingoid bases and antifungal
agents [4,69]. For the rest of the fungal proteins, further
experimental characterization is required before any conclusions can be drawn regarding their involvement in
PCD. Many yeast and mammalian apoptotic proteins
appear to be involved in regulation of cell programs monitoring the cell status such as maintenance of genome
integrity, cell cycle control, glycolipid metabolism, and
ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis [see Additional file 2]
[77]. It is likely that at least non-apoptotic function is conserved in both fungi and metazoa. The results also support
the idea that complex development and differentiation in
filamentous fungi may require additional PCD pathways
or their components not found in unicellular yeasts [78].

lian than to yeast proteins. In addition, homologs of several mammalian apoptotic proteins including PARP and
AMID are found in filamentous fungi, but not in the unicellular yeast such as S. cerevisiae, suggesting that the
Aspergilli may serve as an alternative model to study
mechanisms
of
cell
death.

Conclusion

Phylogenetic Analysis
Protein sequences were re-aligned using MUSCLE [84]
and columns of low conservation removed manually. The
alignments were then used to infer bootstrapped neighbor-joining and maximum-likelihood trees. The neighbor-joining trees were constructed using QuickTree [85]
and the maximum-likelihood trees were constructed
using the PHYLIP package [86], applying the JTT substitution model with a gamma distribution (alpha = 0.5) of
rates over four categories of variable sites. In general, the
maximum-likelihood and neighbor-joining trees were
congruent.

Our analysis identified more than 100 putative PCD-associated genes in this genus, suggesting a complex uncharacterized regulatory network. Their further characterization
may help expand the range of currently available treatments for invasive aspergillosis. The list includes lineagespecific protein families as well as conserved core components of the ancestral PCD machinery shared by all fungi
and metazoa.
The most divergent group is comprised of putative HI
inducers such as STAND, HET-s/LopB and HET domain
proteins that show extreme variability in sequence, copy
number and domain composition. The STAND NTPases
are predicted to interact with different types of effector/
signaling components and function as key integrators of
stress and nutrient availability signals. On the other end of
the spectrum are HI-associated proteins that show broad
phyletic distribution and high sequence conservation.
They tend to be involved in regulation of development,
sexual differentiation, and stress reactions, suggesting that
the HI function in filamentous fungi may have evolved by
recruiting components from these preexisting pathways
[11,52,53].
Further analysis revealed homologs of the yeast PCD proteins in ascomycete and basidiomycete species, further
supporting the view that genes encoding the ancestral
apoptotic machinery evolved with early eukaryotes [7780]. Phylogenetic relationships among the putative PCD
associated proteins appear to be complex and many
Aspergillus proteins show a greater similarity to mamma-

Methods
Sequence similarity
To identify human and mouse proteins implicated in
PCD, we searched the Gene Ontology (GO) database [81]
and the Apoptosis database [82]. Then, sequence similarity searches were performed using PSI-BLAST and Gapped
BLAST against selected fungal genomes downloaded from
GenBank. The searches were also performed against an inhouse database composed of whole-genome sequences of
several fungal species from finished and ongoing sequencing projects. The N. fischeri genome sequence has been
generated in the course of the genome sequencing projects
at TIGR, The Institute for Genomic Research (Rockville,
MD). Conserved protein domains were identified using
the HMMer package [83].
