Examination of equine glandular stomach lesions
for bacteria, including Helicobacter spp by
fluorescence in situ hybridisation

Abstract
Background: The equine glandular stomach is commonly affected by erosion and ulceration. The aim of this study
was to assess whether bacteria, including Helicobacter, could be involved in the aetiology of gastric glandular
lesions seen in horses.
Results: Stomach lesions, as well as normal appearing mucosa were obtained from horses slaughtered for human
consumption. All samples were tested for urease activity using the Pyloritek® assay, while mucosal bacterial content
was evaluated using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridisation. In selected sub samples, bacteria characterisation was
pursued further by cloning and sequencing. Mucosal lesions were found in 36/63 stomachs and included
hyperplastic rugae, polypoid structures and focal erosions. None of the samples were tested positive for urease
activity or for FISH using the Helicobacter genus specific probe. In samples of lesions, as well as normal samples,
clones with 99% similarities to Lactobacillus salivarius and Sarcina ventriculi were found. Escherichia like bacterium
clones and Enterococcus clones were demonstrated in one focal erosion. Based on a phylogenetic tree these
clones had 100% similarity to Escherichia fergusonii and Enterococcus faecium. The Enterococcus were found
colonising the mucosal surface, while E. fergusonii organisms were also demonstrated intraepithelial.
Conclusion: Gastric Helicobacter spp. could not be verified as being involved in lesions of the glandular stomach
of the horse. Since E. fergusonii has been described as an emerging pathogen in both humans and animals, the
finding of this bacterium in gastric erosion warrants further clarification to whether gastric infection with this type
bacterium is important for horses.

Background
In horses, lesions of the non-glandular part of the stomach are highly prevalent and seem to be caused by
excessive acid exposure [1], but little has been described
regarding lesions in the glandular part. Lesions located
in the glandular region were demonstrated in 58% of
162 hospitalized horses [2] and in 47% of 345 racehorses
[3] and while the cause of these have not received much
attention, acid exposure does not seem to be the primary factor, as no correlation between lesions of the
two regions of the stomach has been found [3].
Gastric bacteria as the cause for glandular stomach
lesions have been suggested for many animal species
and in humans these constitute a major verified risk

factor. Of the gastric organisms found, Helicobacter
pylori has been described the most due to its pathogenic
potential of inducing chronic gastritis, ulcers, adenocarcinomas and mucosa associated lymphoid tissue
(MALT) lymphoma in humans [4-6]. Bacteria of this
genus have also been found in gastric tissue samples
from animals including dogs, pigs, sheep and cattle
[7-10].
In the horse, contradictory evidence exits as to
whether bacteria that specifically can cause gastric
lesions occur. A few studies have indicated that gastric
Helicobacter spp. are present in normal appearing
mucosa by using PCR and immunochemistry [11,12],
while others have found no evidence of a connection
between the presence of lesions and bacteria [13]. As
gastric bacterial species have been confirmed or suggested as part of the pathogenesis of certain types of

gastric pathology in humans and other animal species,
the aim of this study was to assess if bacteria could be
involved in the pathology observed in the equine glandular stomach. A main focus was to provide more evidence regarding the presence and localisation of
bacteria in general at the mucosa level of the equine
glandular stomach. Special emphasis was put on obtaining information regarding the presence and involvement
of any Helicobacter species in the mucosal lesions. The
Fluorescence In situ hybridisation (FISH) technique was
used for this purpose which allows the use of rRNA-targeted probes for both the total bacterial population and
defined genus/species. This approach permits the determination of bacterial morphology, abundance, location
in the tissues, and even indications on growth rates and
physiological activities [14].

Results
Gross glandular lesions were seen in 36 of the 63 stomachs examined (57.1%). The majority of lesions were
seen in the antrum region (91.7%). In six stomachs,
lesions were additionally or exclusively seen in the cardia or corpus region. No lesions were found in the
duodenum.
The lesions were classified in three groups as: Polypous (2 stomachs with polypoid masses located in both
the cardia and the antrum with sizes between 1 and 5
centimetres in diameter), ii: Hyperplastic rugae lesions
(13 stomachs) or iii: Hyperaemic, erosive or ulcerative
lesions, which were seen in 21 stomachs.
The hyperplastic rugae were all seen in the antrum
and ranged from having intense hyperemia with exudate
to rugae with normally appearing mucosal surface.
Gross thickening of the antrum rugae was caused primarily by hyperplasia of the gastric foveolae compared
to the respective normal samples. The remaining lesions
were all found to be small solitary lesions of no more
than approximately 1 × 2 cm in size. Focal areas of erosive gastritis was the most common findings of these
type lesions and characterised as sloughing of the superficial cells of the luminal epithelium with a concurrent
fibrinopurulent exudate, luminal cellular debris and a
predominantly mononuclear cell infiltrate of the lamina
propria. Deeper erosions found in 9 stomachs eroded
both the region of the gastric pits and parts of the
glands, which was observed with gastritis only of the
immediate tissues. One true ulcer was found extending
the full thickness of the lamina propria, exposing the
lamina muscularis to the lumen. A maximum of two
lesions were found in each of these stomachs.
Helicobacter and Urease activity test

Using the genus Helicobacter specific probe no positive
signals were found in any of the 79 tissue samples (36

paired samples and 7 controls). In agreement with these
results of the FISH, none of the samples tested positive
for urease activity either. Internal controls of all urease
tests were found positive as indication of a functional
test kit.
Bacteria in general

In general, only few bacteria were observed related to
the mucosal surface in both the injured as well as in the
healthy stomach samples. Overall, four morphological
different types of bacterial cells could be visualized with
the Eubacteria probe: 1) small, short (0.2-0.5 μm) coccoid rods, 2) distinct rods (1 × 3 μm), 3) long chained
rods (up to 60 μm) or 4) large (2-3 μm diameter) coccoid bacteria clearly dividing in pairs. Typically when
present, bacteria were observed in clusters associated
with feed particles or located close to the mucosal
surface
Evidence of bacterial gastritis was found in one stomach lesion grossly characterised as a solitary erosion,
1 × 2 cm in size, the centre being hyperaemic and surrounded by a proliferative epithelial rim (Fig. 1). Microscopically, focal erosion of the mucosa with oozing of
erythrocytes and leukocytes, mainly of neutrophilic origin, was seen. The exudates were additionally seen in
the gastric pits. A cellular inflammatory reaction with
mononuclear cells was seen extending as deep as into
the lamina muscularis. The surface of the inflamed
mucosa and the gastric pits were found heavily colonised by coccoid to short rods applying the probe for
general bacteria (Fig. 2). The short rods were especially

granulocytes, were verified as the Escherichia like bacterium while Enterococcus faecium organisms were identified colonising the epithelial surface by the
Enterococcus specific probe (Fig 4 and 5).

Discussion
Previous studies involving the equine stomach have e.g.
used PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene of especially
Helicobacter spp. [12]. The disadvantages using PCR are
that the amount and location of the bacteria is not

Cloning and sequencing

Based on the morphology and intensity of bacteria
demonstrated using FISH, subsamples of the C/c samples were selected for cloning and sequencing of representing samples including the one with bacterial
gastritis.
Of the chosen subsamples of stomachs demonstrating
various bacteria morphologies, two different types of
clones were found in normal appearing mucosa samples
(c samples), one clone had 99% similarity to Lactobacillus salivarius JCM 1231 (AB370881) and the other type
of clones had 99% similarity to Sarcina ventriculi DSM
316 (X76650).
From the lesions (C samples), clones were also found
with 99% similarity to Lactobacillus salivarius JCM 1231
(AF182725). From the mucosa with bacterial gastritis,
four of ten clones matched 100% Enterococcus faecium,
while the remaining six clones (obtained sequence
deposited at GenBank with the accession no.
GQ423062) belonged to an Escherichia like bacterium.
A phylogenetic tree was constructed with the six Escherichia like clones from the lesion and all had 100%

known and it is uncertain whether the bacteria are alive
or even if the DNA is naked. Hence, it was decided that
using the FISH technique would provide better and
more information of the bacteria found in the glandular
stomach of the horse, as these issues are overcome with
this technique. This technique has been used previously
to describe the spatial distribution of Helicobacter spp.
in the gastrointestinal tract of dogs and in the stomach
of healthy horses to demonstrate the microbiota of the
normal appearing squamous and glandular mucosa
[15,16]. To the best of our knowledge this is the first
study using FISH to examine lesions of the glandular
stomach.
In the present study one case of gastritis associated
with bacterial colonisation was revealed. Especially the
distribution of bacteria suggested a connection with the
pathology observed. The amount of bacteria was markedly increased around the lesion and were tightly
adhered to the epithelial cells, with the bacteria extending into the crypts and located intracellular. The cloning
showed that it was a double infection with Enterococcus
faecium and an Escherichia like bacterium, but it was
subsequently verified using the in situ hybridisation with
a gamma proteobacteria probe that it was only the
Escherichia like bacterium which infiltrated the superficial ulcerations and were found intracellular in epithelial
cells and within neutrophilic granulocytes. Enterobacterial infection in the intestine is a common phenomenon,
but it is rare to find these infections in the stomach and
it has never before been reported in adult horses. This

Page 4 of 8

result is very intriguing but further studies need to clarify how common this phenomenon is in horses. Also,
whether this type of infection is of primary or secondary
origin would need further clarification. The Escherichia
like clones all had 100% 16S rRNA gene similarity to
both E. fergusonii and Shigella flexneri. Thus, in this
study, it can not be precised experimentally which of
these two organisms that were present in this glandular
lesion. However, humans have been reported to be the
only natural host for Shigella [17] whereas E. fergusonii
has been associated with a wide variety of intestinal and
extra-intestinal infections in both humans and animals
including horses[18,19]. It is therefore most likely that
the Escherichia like bacterium found in this study
belongs to E. fergusonii. Studies have reported E. fergusonii as an emerging pathogen and associated with especially bacteraemia and wound infection but its precise
role in infections in both humans and animals still has
to be elucidated [20].
Microbiology in the samples

The environment in the glandular stomach is generally
very hostile toward microbes [21]. It is well established
that, unlike humans and dogs that are meal feeders,
horses are continuous acid producers, probably due to a
continuous feeding pattern [22,23]. The pH in the ventral part of the equine stomach is stable at around pH
1-3 throughout the 24 hour period [24], consequently
the relative low diversity of bacteria observed in mucosal
samples in this study was not unexpected.
The characteristic morphological phenotype of large
cocci growing in regular tetrads was established to be a
clone with a 99% similarity to Sarcina ventriculi. This
organism is known to be able to grow in stomach contents and has the characteristic tetrade structure when
grown from pH 1- pH 3 [25]. In the current study, the
finding of these organisms could not be established to
be part of any specific pathology, as they were found in
low numbers in the paired samples (i.e. lesion and normal), as well as in the control samples. Sarcina-like bacteria have been found in a variety of species, where they
have been supposed to cause abomasal bloat, haemorrhage and ulcers in lambs and goat kids [26,27] and a
possible link to gastric dilatation in both dogs and
horses has also been suggested [28]. No evidence of gas
accumulations was observed macroscopically in any of
these horses and hence it does not seem that the presence of Sarcina ventriculi contributed to the pathology
observed in these horses.
It was not surprising that Lactobacillus (Lactobacillus
salivarius) was found in the studied tissues and it has previously been reported that several Lactobacillus spp.,
including L. salivarius, are present in healthy horses
[16,29]. The proximal equine stomach functions as storage

Husted et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:84
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/84

for feed, as well as a compartment for intragastric fermentation. The ecosystem in this region consists of both anaerobic and lactate-utilizing bacteria in large numbers,
which are responsible for the increase in volatile fatty
acids upon fermentation of carbohydrates [30]. Especially
Lactobacilli were found adhering to the epithelium in the
proximal part of the equine stomach [31] and these bacteria will likely pass to the glandular stomach as part of
the normal turn-over. We have only examined subsamples
and more bacterial taxa will be found in the healthy part
of the glandular stomach if a more comprehensive microbiota community study was done.
Validity of the findings of Helicobacter

None of the tissue samples from the antrum region
demonstrated positive signals from the Helicobacter spp.
probe in this study and no spiral shaped bacteria were
noted using the FISH technique either. In a recent study
from Venezuela, spiral shaped bacteria were reported in
biopsies from the cardiac region of the equine stomach
stained with the Warthin-Starry stain [12]. Helicobacter
spp. known to be able to colonize the stomach produce
large amounts of cytoplasmic urease[32] The rapid
urease test used in this investigation, Pyloritek®, detects
the urease activity of the tissue sample by the production of ammonia when urea is present. It is extensively
used in human practice to detect gastritis caused by
Helicobacter spp. The positive and negative predictive
values were between 98.1-100% and 95.8-100%, respectively in a study testing human patients before and after
eradication of the bacterium [33]. In this study, no positive tests were found, indicating that the biopsies in the
present study contained no bacteria with the ability to
produce urease.

Conclusions
Gastric Helicobacter spp. was not found and could not
be linked to the stomach lesions of the 36 horses analyzed in this study. The pathology found in this study
included polypoid structures, hyperplastic rugae and
small erosions, but bacterial involvement was found in
only one case of an erosion. In this lesion, an Escherichia-like clone, most likely E. fergusonii, was found
intracellular. Whether this was a primary or secondary
infection could not be concluded. Very limited amounts
of bacteria in general were found in the equine glandular region as expected. Thus, detection of a moderate to
high amounts of any bacteria at the glandular mucosa
level, as well as in the crypts should be cause for concern as this does not seem to be a normal finding in the
equine glandular stomach. Further studies involving bacteria and the relation to gastric lesions of horses with
confirmed clinical signs are warranted, as these horses
were not included in the current study.

Methods
Horses and study design

The study was done as a cross-sectional study of stomachs from a population of 63 abattoir horses in Denmark. Horses were approved by the Veterinary Officer
as healthy for slaughter. Horses were stunned with a
captive bolt and exsanguinated. The stomach, including
5 - 10 cm of the distal esophagus and 10 cm of the
proximal duodenum, was removed immediately after
evisceration and opened along the greater curvature.
Ingesta were removed and if necessary, the mucosa was
gently rinsed with a minimum of tap water before
inspection. Only stomachs with gross lesions in the
glandular mucosa were included, as well as seven control stomachs with no gross evidence of gastric lesions.
Glandular lesions were defined as the mucosa having
an abnormal macroscopic appearance i.e. hyperaemic,
increased thickness, erosions or ulcers. The anatomical
positions of the lesions were noted as: The cardia, corpus or antrum region (Fig. 6).
Sampling procedure

From each stomach with glandular lesions, three tissue
samples where obtained of the largest lesion (A, B, C) as
well as three paired normal appearing tissue samples (a,
b, c) from the same anatomical region, but at least at
least 5 cm away. A/a: a small, biopsy size (0,5 × 0,5 cm)
mucosa sample was obtained for immediate urease testing with the Pyloritek ® assay according to the manufactures instructions. Tests were read after a 60 minute

Figure 6 Anatomical regions of the stomach opened along the
greater curvature. The non-glandular region has a white
appearing epithelium, whereas the glandular region is shades of
red. They are separated by the Margo plicatus. The three sampled
regions include: Cardia as the small strip area just below and along
the margo plicatus, the corpus region containing acid, pepsinogen
and mucus secreting glands (dark red) and the antrum region
containing primarly mucus and gastrin secreting glands.

standard time and results noted as positive or negative.
Samples B/b: a 3 × 3 cm full thickness tissue sample
including mucosa and submucosa were obtained for
FISH and fixed in 10% buffered formalin. After 24 hours
fixation the samples were transferred to 70% ethanol,
paraffin-embedded, sectioned at 3 μm and mounted on
SuperFrost/plus slides (Menzel-Gläser, Braunschweig
Germany).
Samples C/c: a third pair of tissue samples for cloning
and sequencing was obtained and snap frozen using dry
ice (If lesion size allowed it).
From the seven control stomachs with no macroscopic
gastric lesions, samples a, b and c were taken from the
normal appearing mucosa of the antrum. Three of these
horses were additionally sampled in the cardia, corpus
and duodenum as well.
The sampling procedures took place from August to
October 2007. Historical data regarding previous health
of the horses could not be obtained.
Fluorescent In Situ Hybridisation for bacteria

For microbial detection, the tissue sections were hybridized simultaneously with two 16S rRNA probes
labelled with different fluorophores. The oligonucleotide
probe S-D-BACT-0338-a-A-18 targeting Bacteria
(5’GCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT3’) [34] was 5’ labeled
with the fluorescein isothiocyanate and with isothiocyanate derivative Cy3. The oligonucleotide probe HEL717
targeting the Helicobacter genus (5’AGGTCGCCTTCGCAATGAGTA3’) [35] was 5’ labeled with isothiocyanate
derivative Cy3. To verify the cloning results a third and
fourth probe, L-C-gProt-1027-a-A-17 (5’GCCTTCCCACATCGTTT3’) targeting 23S rRNA of Gammaproteobacteria was 5’ labeled with the fluorescein
isothiocyanate and probe S-G-Enteroco-184 (5’CAAATCAAAACCATGCGG3’) was Cy3 labeled targeting 16S
rRNA of Enterococcus spp[36]. All probes were synthesised at DNA Technology, Aarhus, Denmark. The slides
were deparaffinized in xylene and transferred to 100%
alcohol for 30 min before hybridisation. The hybridisation was carried out at 45°C with 40 ml of hybridisation
buffer (100 mM Tris [pH 7.2], 0.9 M NaCl, 0.1% sodium
dodecyl sulfate) and 200 ng of each probe for 16 hours
in a Sequenza Slide Rack (Thermo Shandon, Cheshire,
UK). The samples were then washed three times in prewarmed (45°C) hybridisation buffer for 15 min and subsequently three times in prewarmed (45°C) washing
solution (100 mM Tris [pH 7.2], 0.9 M NaCl). The samples were rinsed in water, air dried and mounted in
Vectashield (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA,
USA) for epifluorescence microscopy. An Axioimager
M1 epifluorescence microscope equipped for epifluorescence with a 100-W HBO lamp and filter sets 43 and 38
were used to visualize Cy3 and fluorescein, respectively.

Page 6 of 8

Images were obtained using an AxioCam MRm version
3 FireWiremonocrome camera and the software AxioVision version 4.5 (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).
Evaluation of the epifluorescence microscopy was performed by description of the subjective amount, morphologic appearance and location of fluorescing cells
apparent in each tissue sample. In addition, all tissue
sections were stained by H&E and evaluated
histopathologically.
16S rDNA amplification and cloning

After the detection of bacteria using FISH, sub samples
from horses demonstrating bacteria of various morphologies were chosen for 16S rRNA gene cloning. The
DNA was isolated from 4 tissue samples by using the
Easy-DNA kit (Invitrogen, Tåstrup, Denmark) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The 16S rRNA gene
was amplified using primers S-D-Bact-0008-a-S-20 (5’AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3’) [37] and S-*-Univ1492-a-A-19 (5’-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3’) [38].
PCR cycling consisted of an initial denaturation at 94°C
for 6 min; followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C
for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 45 s and extension at
72°C for 2 min; and a final extension at 72°C for 3 min.
Amplified DNA was verified by electrophoresis on agarose gels. The PCR products were purified using the
QIAquick PCR purification kit columns (Qiagen GmbH,
Hilden, Germany). To create blunt-ended DNA the following was mixed in a 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, 4 μl
of 5 × T4 DNA polymerase buffer, 14.7 μl of purified
PCR product 0.8 μl of dNTP (2.5 mmol l -1 each) and
0.5 μl (1.2 U) of T4 DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and
incubated at 12°C for 15 min. The T4 DNA polymerase
was heat-inactivated, and the blunt-ended DNA was
purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit columns (Qiagen GmbH) and eluted in a final volume of
10 μl of double-distilled water. Following the manufacturer’s descriptions the cloning was performed by using
a Zero blunt TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen). Ten colonies from each cloning were picked and sequenced on
an automatic sequence analyser (ABI PRISM 373 DNA
Sequencer; PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) by
using the two standard vector primers (T3 and T7)
included in the kit. The sequence was assembled in Bionumerics version 4.0 (Applied Math, Sint-MartensLatem, Belgium) and checked for chimeras both by
blasting the individual sequences in GenBank http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and by the software Pintail version 1.1 http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/biosi/research/biosoft/.
The phylogenetic analysis of the clones belonging to the
Escherichia genus was done by downloading 16S rRNA
gene sequences longer than 1,200 bp from the RDP v.9
database of the Escherichia type strains http://rdp.cme.
msu.edu. The sequences were trimmed to the same

Husted et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:84
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/84

length of 1327 bp and aligned pairwise (UPGMA) followed by a global sequence alignment. A final phylogenetic tree was constructed by using the WARD
algorithm where Enterobacter sakazakii (AB004746) was
used as outgroup.
