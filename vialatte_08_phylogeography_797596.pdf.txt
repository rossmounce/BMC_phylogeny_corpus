Abstract
Background: Present day distributions of Palearctic taxa in northern latitudes mainly result from
populations having survived in local patches during the Late Pleistocene and/or from recolonizing
populations from southern temperate refugia. If well-studied Mediterranean and eastern European
refugia are widely accepted, some recent biogeographical assumptions still remain unclear, such as
the occurrence of multiple glacial refugia in Iberia and cryptic refugia in northern Europe during the
last glaciations. The Lusitanian snail Elona quimperiana has a remarkably disjunct distribution, limited
to northwestern France (Brittany), northwestern Spain and the Basque Country. By describing the
phylogeographical structure of this species across its entire range, the present study attempts to
identify refugia and subsequent recolonization routes.
Results: Results based on 16S and COI gene sequences showed that the low genetic diversity
observed in the Brittany populations should be associated with a recent demographic expansion.
By contrast, populations from Spain exhibit several differentiated lineages and are characterized by
demographic equilibrium, while the Basque populations are the only ones harboring typical distinct
haplotypes. The center of the star-like networks of both gene sequences is occupied by a common
ancestral-like haplotype found in Brittany and Spain, which might have originated from the middle
of Northern Spain (i.e. Asturias, eastern Lugo and western Cantabria). Estimates of the divergence
time between the Spain-Brittany and Basque lineages strongly suggest that E. quimperiana survived
the Pleistocene glaciations in distinct refugia on the Iberian Peninsula, one of which is situated in
Picos de Europa, and the other in the Basque Country. The occurrence of a northern refugium in
France cannot be rejected as of yet.
Conclusion: Present results confirm the Iberian origin of the land snail E. quimperiana and strongly
support the emerging phylogeographic hypothesis of multiple refugia in Iberia during the last
glaciations. The scenario of a spatial expansion of E. quimperiana from an Iberian refuge located in
Asturias to northern areas provides the most probable explanation for the present distribution of
this land snail. By harboring distinct haplotypes, the Basque Country populations appear to be of
great importance in terms of potential adaptation, long term persistence and hence, the
conservation of E. quimperiana.

Background
Geographically structured populations are the result of
historical and/or contemporary demography. Some of
them may experience either little or no genetic contact for
long periods of time, due to physical, ecological or geographical barriers (e.g. [1-6]). More recent and rapid
events, such as extinction, introduction or fragmentation,
often linked to human activities, may also produce spatially partitioned populations (e.g. [7,8]).
For European species, the Quaternary glaciations are a
major historical factor shaping the patterns of spatial population structure [9-13]. During these periods, the ice
sheet induced the preservation of many species, but only
in isolated refugia, resulting in population divergence via
genetic drift and local selection [14]. The commonly recognized refugia in Western Europe during the Quaternary
glaciations are on the Iberian and the Italian peninsulas
[10,14,15]. It has been suggested that the northern
regions of Europe were post-glacially colonized, generally
from these refuges [10,14]. Recent phylogeographic and
biogeographic studies have uncovered multiple refugia in
Iberia (see [16] for a review). However, the number, location and habitat composition of these 'refugia in refugia'
still remain poorly known. Scenarios other than the
northern expansion from southern refugia have also been
proposed. On one hand, cold-tolerant species, such as
Mustela erminea [17], could have naturally expanded
their repartition range during the Quaternary glaciations.
On the other hand, the presence of additional putative refugia has been advanced to explain the distribution of poor
cold-hardy species [18,19]. The hypothesis of local, but
relatively recent and short-lived refugia much further
north of the Mediterranean refugia is concordant with the
discontinuity of the Pleistocene ice sheet in this region
[20]. These temperate refugia are particularly recognized
to explain the survival of some communities, such as
freshwater fish [21]. The principal biome of unglaciated
northern Europe during the late Pleistocene cold stages
was the steppe tundra, i.e. a treeless vegetation type [22].
The presence of small isolated populations of trees in
buffered local microclimates is also suspected in northwestern Europe during the Pleistocene; but, except for one
controversial site in Belgium [18], no temperate forest refugia for animal species have actually been precisely localized in this part of Europe. Therefore, contemporary
demographic factors are more likely to explain well-separated populations of poor cold-hardy species in Western
Europe, such as human introductions (e.g. [23]), or the
recent extinction of intermediate populations [24].
The land snail Elona quimperiana (Gastropoda, Xanthonychidae [25]) is a western Palearctic Helicoidea species with
a highly disjunct distribution limited to Brittany in France
(its name comes form the city of Quimper) and Northern

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/339

Spain (Fig. 1, [26]). It is a so-called Lusitanian species, i.e.
a species that typically has a disjunct distribution in Iberia
and southwest Ireland, with either no or highly disjunct
populations in the regions between both areas (i.e. England and France) [27,28]. Elona quimperiana therefore provides an excellent opportunity to shed more light on
European historical biogeography. This species lives in
temperate and humid deciduous forests, where it feeds on
mycelia found on rotten, dead stumps (principally oak).
Occasionally, it is coprophagous and necrophagous [29].
Like many other terrestrial gastropods, E. quimperiana has
a relatively limited dispersal capacity and probably survived during the Quaternary glaciations through significant fluctuations in its distribution area, just as its
deciduous forest habitat did [30]. The present study is
based on phylogeographical analyses that are highly successful in discriminating past and present demographic
factors that were likely to have influenced the distribution
of populations. The aims are to (i) describe the phylogeographical structure of E. quimperiana throughout its entire
range, and (ii) identify the refugia and the subsequent recolonization routes.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis
The length of 16S rDNA sequences ranged from 479 to
481 bp, with a total of 19 substitutions, including two
indels at positions 123 and 420, while the length of the
COI sequences was 683 bp, with a total of 47 substitutions. Eleven haplotypes were identified among the 54
snails analyzed for the 16S gene: eight from Spain, three
from Brittany, and one from the Basque Country. Brittany
had only one haplotype (haplotype 1) in common with
Spain; this haplotype was the most frequent one, since 30
individuals shared it. Twenty-three haplotypes were
obtained for the COI gene among the 81 individuals analyzed: eleven from Spain, six from Brittany (including one
in common with Spain) and seven from the Basque Country. The most frequent haplotype (haplotype A), shared by
more the half of the specimens, was also the only one
common to both Brittany and Spain.

The networks based on the 16S rDNA and COI sequences
exhibited convergent results. The 16S network showed
two haplogroups (Hg1 and Hg11; Fig 2). Hg1 comprised
10 haplotypes (46 individuals) that were scattered
throughout Spain and Brittany. The most frequent haplotype in this group (H1; 30 individuals) is distributed
throughout all of Brittany (except at BZH3 Pont Calleck)
and occurs in the Spanish provinces of Lugo, Asturias and
western Cantabria (sites Sp2, Sp3, Sp4 and Sp5; Fig 3). All
of the other Hg1 haplotypes are represented by either a
single or few specimens. Haplotypes 2 and 3 are specific
to Brittany and were only found at BZH2 (Montagnes
Noires) and BZH3 (Pont Calleck). In Spain, a total of

seven private haplotypes were found in five out of six populations: haplotypes 4 and 5 were typical of Sp6 (Reme),
haplotype 6 was specific to Sp5 (Gio), haplotype 7 was
only found at Sp4 (Pravia), haplotype 8 was present in
Sp2 (Cobreces), and haplotypes 9 and 10 were typical for
the Cantabria province (site Sp1, Ramales de la Victoria).
The second haplogroup, Hg11, comprised only one haplotype (H11), which only occurred in Basque snails from
Bqα (Sare) and Bqβ (Toloza Betulu).
The populations of the two haplogroups formed by COI
sequences (HgA and HgS) are the same as those found in
Hg1 and Hg11 (Fig 4). HgA comprised 16 haplotypes (71
individuals), the most frequent of which was HA (44 individuals). The distribution of HA is comparable to that of
H1, since it is found in both Brittany (except for the eastern sites, BZH1 and BZH11) and Spain (sites Sp3, Sp4 and
Sp5). All of the other HgA haplotypes are represented by
either a single or few specimens (Fig 5). The HB, HC, HJ,
HL and HO haplotypes are specific to Brittany. Most of the
10 haplotypes specific to Spain are private. As for haplo-

group Hg11, HgW exclusively comprised all of the Basque
snails and included seven private haplotypes (HQ, HR,
HS, HT, HU, HV and HW).
The genetic diversity estimates are given in Table 1. Obviously, both the haplotype and nucleotide diversities are
much higher for both genes in the populations from
Spain (h16S rDNA = 0.81 ± 0.01; π16S rDNA = 1.89 ± 1.25;
hCOI = 0.85 ± 0.05; πCOI = 4.73 ± 2.39), compared to
those from Brittany (h16S rDNA = 0.16 ± 0.1, π16S rDNA
= 0.24 ± 0.32; hCOI = 0.34 ± 0.09; πCOI = 0.44 ± 0.4).
While no variation is detected in the Basque populations
for the 16S region, the gene and nucleotide diversities are
relatively high for the COI gene (hCOI = 0.91 ± 0.07; πCOI
= 3.89 ± 2.11).
Demographic analysis
Hypotheses of demographic expansion were tested using
Fu's Fs and Ramos-Onsins & Rozas' R2 statistics (Table 2).
Both tests yielded results that were consistent with a population expansion of both the Hg1 and HgA haplogroups,
mainly driven by the significant expansion of the Brittany

populations. The unimodal distribution of pairwise differences among the Brittany populations (Fig 6) and the
non-significant raggedness index obtained from the mismatch distribution analyses (Table 2) are consistent with
a model of recent expansion [31].
Bayesian estimation of time to the most recent common
ancestor
The molecular-clock likelihood ratio-tests (LRT) showed
no significant variation of the substitution rate among the
branches of both the COI and 16S phylogenies. For 16S,
2ΔlogL = 24.5, df = 54, p = 0.99; for COI, 2ΔlogL = 29.5,
df = 82, p = 0.99 with all codon positions, and 2ΔlogL =
66.33, d.f. = 82, p = 0.90, with the third-codon position
only. Applying divergence rates ranging from 4 to 6.86%
per Myr for the third codon of COI, the most recent common ancestor of all of the E. quimperiana populations
(and 95% HPD) would have lived between 1 (0.64–1.45)

to 0.6 (0.37–0.84) Myr ago (Table 3). The TMRCA, based
on the COI-3rd base divergence rate, was estimated as
being between 0.43 and 0.25 Myr for the Brittany-Spain
lineage and between 0.31 and 0.18 Myr for the Basque lineage. Convergent time estimates were obtained for the
Brittany-Spain clade with a 2.2% rate of evolution for COI
(all bases; 0.29 Myr) and 2% for 16S (0.20 Myr). For the
Basque clade, while a divergence rate of 2.2% for COI (all
bases) leads to the same time value estimate (0.18 Myr), a
four times lower divergence rate for 16S (around 0.5%/
Myr) yielded an equivalent time estimate. In spite of
homogeneous substitution rates among the branches in
the 16S phylogeny, the molecular clock does not seem to
tick regularly.

Discussion
In spite of its name, an ancient Iberian origin of Elona
quimperiana is obvious, as has been suggested earlier [26].

number of individuals carrying these haplotypes.

This is strongly supported by the observation that most of
the mtDNA diversity is found in Spain, and by the fact
that Spanish haplotypes have a central position in both of
the star-like sequence networks. Our genetic comparison
of populations from the two disjunct distribution areas of
E. quimperiana reveals that the genetic differentiation does
not mirror the large geographical discontinuity of the species range.
Actually, the genetic divergences isolate the Basque populations from a homogeneous genetic group comprising
the Spanish and Brittany populations. Both the 16S rDNA
and COI genes show specific Basque haplotypes, forming
separate clades in the two haplotype networks. The low
level of genetic diversity, especially for the 16S gene, the
occurrence of private haplotypes, and the peripheral location suggest that the Basque populations may form a parapatric race [14], although no morphological peculiarities
could be detected. Such peripheral populations frequently
mark a threshold of environmental variation, beyond
which the species cannot expand [32]. As the split
between the Basque and central Spanish populations
would have occurred between 1 Myr to 600,000 BP, it can
be most easily interpreted by assuming that the species

survived the Pleistocene Ice Ages in separate glacial refugia
on the Iberian Peninsula [16]. Indeed, the occurrence of
'refugia within an Iberian refugium' is now largely supported by data from a range of organisms. Among the
seven putative terrestrial refugia identified in this area,
those located along the Picos de Europa (north of Spain,
[33-37]) and in/or near the Pyrenees [34,36,38] coincide
quite strikingly with the phylogeographic structure we
obtained (Fig 7). Our results thus support the spatial subdivision hypothesis of an Iberian Peninsula glacial refugia
[16], and help to refine the Pyrenees refugium theory by
suggesting the Basque Country as a refuge zone during the
Pleistocene glaciations. Moreover, the presence of the
closely related species Norelona pyrenaica, which is
endemic in the eastern Pyrenees, where E. quimperiana
does not live (Fig 7, [39]), suggests the occurrence of
another separate refuge in this part of the Pyrenees, which
is probably influenced by Mediterranean climates. Contemporary anthropogenic effects may also influence the
population structure of E. quimperiana since estimates of
the split of the Basque populations match glacial and
postglacial times (Table 3). Recurrent bottlenecks, due to
habitat fragmentation and the alteration of natural forest
habitat in the Basque Country [40], could have accentu-

ated this genetic divergence (e.g. [41,42]). This could
explain the discrepancies in the divergence time estimates
between the two genetic markers, while a strong concordance has been observed in the divergence time estimates
for other E. quimperiana lineages. By harboring distinct
haplotypes, the Basque Country populations appear to be
of great importance in terms of potential adaptation, long
term persistence and hence, the conservation of E. quimperiana.
Besides the strong genetic divergence of the Basque lineage, the present results also show that in the Spain-Brittany lineage, (i) the genetic diversity is higher in Spain,
(ii) the Spanish and Brittany populations share one common haplotype for each gene, which is, moreover, the
most frequent in the two areas, and (iii) the Spanish populations are at demographic equilibrium, while the Brittany ones would have experienced a recent expansion.

Three scenarios might be considered in order to explain
the origin of Brittany populations: 1 – a recent introduction by human activities, 2 – an ancient northward colonization preceding the last glacial period, as demonstrated
for other Lusitanian species [19], 3 – a spatial expansion
after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), also from native
Spanish populations [24]. In the first case, it is expected to
have haplotypes in common with the source and introduced zones, as illustrated by 16S rDNA-H1 and COI-HA.
All of the other haplotypes found in Brittany are specific
to this area, suggesting that they probably appeared in
Brittany after an introduction. However, such post-introduction genetic diversification is more typical for species
with high colonization capabilities, which is not the case
for E. quimperiana [29]. Moreover, related life history features, inconsistent with human activities or production,
render multiple introductions improbable. All of these
points make the first assumption rather unlikely.

The second hypothesis conforms to predictions of the
effects of the ice ages on genetic variability in populations:
populations with historical distributions in northern latitudes present lower genetic diversity, with fewer differentiated lineages, than southern populations (Hewitt [14]
and Avise [9]). This has been demonstrated in other ecto-

therm species [43]. An ancient expansion of populations
from Iberia through France during the Pleistocene interglacial periods may be plausible, since during these periods, the environmental conditions in Western Europe
(e.g. high precipitation and cool temperatures) were particularly favorable to E. quimperiana, all the more so given

that oak was a dominant tree species [30]. Under this
hypothesis, a subset of southern haplotypes (from the
Picos de Europa refugium) would have expanded northward, while others (from the Pyrenees refugium)
remained in the south. Glaciations would have subsequently eradicated most of the E. quimperiana populations, except in the Iberian refugia and in a northern
refuge zone. Indeed, small microenvironmentally favorable zones might have been created by oak trees in Western
Europe [44]. According to paleoclimatic reconstructions,
the local environmental conditions in close proximity to
the arboreal vegetation were indeed warmer and more
humid than regional simulations of the full-glacial climate [45]. Within close proximity to the trees, poor coldhardy flora and fauna were also able to survive the
extremes of the LGM. It is also possible that the Pleistocene refuge in northwestern France may involve caves,
as suspected in Belgium for other poor cold-hardy animals and deciduous trees [18]. Elona quimperiana is
indeed frequently observed in caves [46], where it survives
by coprophagous and necrophagous feeding.

000-9500 years ago [47], the oceanic climate of the west
coast in France could have allowed a rapid spread of E.
quimperiana from southern refugia to northern areas.
Since this snail is strongly associated with oak forests, its
dispersal may follow the tree expansion pattern. Human
deforestation in intermediate areas between the Basque
Country and Brittany, around 1000-500 years ago, may
have created induced open habitats that are hostile for E.
quimperiana [48], thus potentially explaining its present
disjunct distribution.
There is no fossil record of E. Quimperiana due to the
extreme fragility of its thin shell. Although the occurrence
of a northern refugium should not be discarded a priori, an
exhaustive sampling of the southern distribution range
(based on a new imperative inventory, since many
recorded sites appear to be presently disturbed by human
activities) where Pleistocene refugia are obvious, appears
necessary in order to clarify the colonization history of
Brittany by E. quimperiana.

Conclusion
Unfortunately, our results cannot distinguish between the
second and the third scenario. The latter implies a colonization of Brittany after the last glaciations. As illustrated
by oak (Quercus sp.) dispersal in Great Britain some 10

The present results confirm the Iberian origin of the land
snail E. quimperiana and reveal a genetic differentiation
separating a Basque lineage from monophyletic clade
grouping sequences from Brittany and Spain. Divergence

the Basque Country. Ha and Cn: outgroups corresponding respectively to Cantareus aspersus and Cepaea nemoralis. The
scaled bar under the trees represents a 0.1% sequence divergence. Genetically sustained refugia during the glaciations are localized in Picos de Europa in Spain (RPE) and the Basque Country in the Pyrenees (RPY), while a putative third refugia during the
last glaciations may be hypothesized in Brittany (RB?). The localized distribution of the related species Norelona pyrenaica is
specified (eastern Pyrenees).

time estimates suggest the coexistence of these lineages in
the Iberian refugia during the LGM, and strongly support
the hypothesis of 'refugia in refugia' during glaciations.
The identification of Iberian lineages allows the precision
of the glacial refugia in the Basque Country and Asturias
locations. Moreover, the species' ecology (inhabiting
deciduous oak forests) allows researchers to sharpen their
focus on the type of habitat present in these refugia during
the glaciations. The scenario of a spatial expansion of E.
quimperiana from the Iberian refugia located in Asturias to
northern areas in France is the most probable for explaining the present distribution of the land snail. Inferences
based on a spatial genetic structure analysis should be
helpful to discriminate between a pre-glacial expansion
implying the existence of glacial refugia in Brittany, or a
post-glacial expansion followed by the human oak deforestation along the Atlantic coast in France.

Methods
Sample collection
Tissue samples were taken from a total of 81 individuals
legally collected in 19 field populations across Brittany
(France, sites BZH1 to BZH11), the Basque Country
(France and Spain, sites BQα and BQβ) and Northern
Spain (sites Sp1 to Sp6) between 2006 and 2007 (Fig 1).
The other sites where this species was previously inventoried (see [26] for a review) were thoroughly searched, but
no snails were found. The principal threat to this species
is probably deforestation in those areas.
DNA Extraction, Amplification and Sequencing
Foot tissue was dissected from each individual and placed
in a 10% chelex solution, with 15 μl of proteinase K (10
mg/ml). Samples were incubated overnight at 55°C, and
then briefly vortexed, before being boiled for 2 × 15 min.

After a centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 s, the DNA in the
supernatant was used in the subsequent amplifications.
DNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) for the mitochondrial 16S rDNA on a set of 54 individuals, and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxydase-1
(COI) on 81 individuals. The 16S rDNA and COI gene
fragments correspond, respectively, to a 480 base pair
sequence using the primers 984 (5'-CGCCTGTTTAACAAAAACAT-3') and 16S2 (5'-CTGGCTTACGCCGGTCTG-3') [49], and to a 683 base pair sequence using the
primers FCOI (5'-ACTCAACGAATCATAAAGATATTGG3') and RCOI (5'-TATACTTCAGGATGACCAAAAAATCA3') [50,51]. PCRs were carried out in 25 μl volumes containing 0.5 μl (10 μM) of each forward and reverse primers, 12.5 μl of the Diamond DNA Polymerase – 500
(Bioline®), 10.25 μl of UP water and 1.25 μl of DNA template. The PCR conditions for the 16S rDNA gene were an
initial denaturation step of 94°C (3 min), followed by 35
cycles of 94°C (30 s), 49°C (30 s), 72°C (40 s) and a final
extension phase at 72°C for 4 min. Those for the COI
gene were an initial denaturation step of 94°C (5 min),
followed 35 cycles of 94°C (45 s), 52°C (45 s),72°C (1
min) and a final extension phase at 72°C for 7 min. The
PCR products were sequenced in both directions on an
automated sequencer using the PCR primers (PE Applied
Biosystems 310 Genetic Analyser, UMR 6553; plate-forme
de séquençage génotypage OUEST-genopole®).
Sequence analysis
Sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL W [52] and were
manually checked in the BIOEDIT sequence editing program [53]. The sequences have been submitted to GenBank (Accession N° FJ491809-FJ491943). Sequence
polymorphism analyses (haplotype diversity h and nucleotide diversity π) were carried out with DNASP version
4.10. [54] and ARLEQUIN version 3.1 [55]. The land snails
Cantareus aspersus and Cepaea nemoralis were used as outgroups.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic relationships among haplotypes were estimated using maximum likelihood (ML) and MarkovChain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) bayesian-based inference
(BI) methods. ML and BI analyses were performed using
PAUP* version 4.0b10 [56] and MRBAYES v. 3.1.1-p1 [57]
softwares, respectively. The best fit model of nucleotide
substitutions was selected prior to ML and BI using the
Akaike Information Criterion [58]. The software MrAIC
v.1.4.2 [59] was used to evaluate the fit of the data to 24
different models of nucleotide substitutions. The resulting
best fit model was the F81 model [60] for the 16S rDNA
region, with an unequal rate for base frequencies and
equal rates for transitions and transversion. For the COI
gene, the best fit model was the HKY model [61] with two

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/339

different rates for transitions and transversion, unequal
base frequencies, a parameter for invariable sites (I) and a
gamma distribution parameter that describes the rate variation across variable sites (Γ). The model of nucleotide
substitution was incorporated in PHYML[62] and in
MRBAYES for the ML and BI analyses respectively. For the
ML analysis, the robustness of inferences was assessed by
bootstrap resampling using 1,000 repetitions. For the
Bayesian analysis, the posterior probabilities of trees and
parameters were approximated with Markov-Chain
Monte-Carlo and Metropolis coupling. We ran two independent MCMC analyses with four chains and a temperature set to 0.2. Each chain was run for 2,000,000 cycles
with trees sampled every 100 generations. Posterior probabilities were obtained from the 50% majority rule consensus of trees sampled after discarding the trees saved
before chains reached apparent stationarity (i.e. a 'burn-in
period" of 50,000 generations for 16S rDNA).
We used network-based approaches for intraspecific phylogenetic analyses to deal with the low divergence among
individuals and the possible persistence of ancestral
nodes [63]. The median joining algorithm implemented
in the NETWORK v. 4.2.0.1 software [64] was used with the
default settings for constructing networks (weight = 10
and e = 0), and we simplified the median networks that
contained all of the possible equally shortest trees by running the MP (maximum parsimony) calculation option.
Demographic analyses
The demographic history of the populations was inferred
using two of the most powerful tests of population expansion: (i) Fu's Fs [65], which represents the probability of
observing a similar or a higher number of haplotypes in a
random neutral population given the observed value of
theta. In populations that have experienced recent expansion, large negative values of Fs are expected, due to an
excess of rare alleles; (ii) Ramos-Onsins & Rozas' [66]R2
statistics, representing the difference between the number
of singleton mutations and the average number of pairwise differences. Recent population expansions are
expected to be associated with low values of this parameter. R2 and Fs statistics were estimated using DNASP v.
4.10.9 [54] and ARLEQUIN v. 3.1 [55] respectively, and
their significance was assessed using 1,000 coalescent simulated resamplings. In order to evaluate the possible historical events of population growth or decline, mismatch
distribution analyses were also performed [67]; in the first
case, populations show unimodal distributions, while in
the second case the populations at demographic equilibrium present multimodal distributions [68]. Mismatch
distributions were computed for each haplogroup and
compared to the expected distributions obtained under a
model of sudden expansion.

Molecular clock and divergence times
A molecular-clock likelihood ratio-test (LRT, [47,50]) was
first conducted on the 16S rDNA and COI sequences
(considering the three bases and only the third base of
codon) to ascertain whether or not the Elona sequences
were evolving at a homogeneous rate along all of the
branches in the phylogenies. This test compares the loglikelihood of the ML trees under alternative molecular
clock assumptions (i.e. a relaxed vs. an enforced molecular clock). The statistic A = 2(lnL1–lnL2) could be compared with a distribution with (n-2) degrees of freedom
(where n is the number of sequences). Divergence dates
were computed using BEAST[69] in order to provide estimates of time to the most common ancestor (TMCRA) for
E. quimperiana populations, along with the TMCRAs of the
Brittany-Spain (Hg1 and HgA) and the Basque lineages
(see Results). An HKY model of nucleotide substitution
was employed with a sequence divergence rate based on
several different published rates for molluscs. While the
divergence rates for 16S rDNA are estimated at around 2%
per Myr for animals [70], the estimates for gastropods vary
between 0.5 – 0.6% [71,72] up to an accelerated rate of
10% per Myr, as seen in the land snail Mandarina sp [73].
For COIGENE, we used rates from bivalve species inferred
from geological events [74]. These rates range from 0.03
to 6.84% per Myr, depending on the codon position considered. The number of mutations recorded for the COI
first- and second-positions (7 of 456 nucleotides) and
COI third-positions (39 of 227 nucleotides) may reflect a
variation in rates of substitution among these types of
sites, in favor of a higher rate for COI third-positions.
Given that the clades of the BI tree, based on the two first
codon positions of COI, appeared to not be statistically
supported (result not shown), we applied COI third-positions rates only when estimating divergence times (4 to
6.86% per Myr). These time estimates were then used to
infer the 16S rDNA mutation rates by testing several substitution rates (0.5%, 2% and 10% per Myr).
