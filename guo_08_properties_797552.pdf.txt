Abstract
Background: Parasites in the genus Theileria cause lymphoproliferative diseases in cattle, resulting in
enormous socio-economic losses. The availability of the genome sequences and annotation for T. parva
and T. annulata has facilitated the study of parasite biology and their relationship with host cell
transformation and tropism. However, the mechanism of transcriptional regulation in this genus, which
may be key to understanding fundamental aspects of its parasitology, remains poorly understood. In this
study, we analyze the evolution of non-coding sequences in the Theileria genome and identify conserved
sequence elements that may be involved in gene regulation of these parasitic species.
Results: Intergenic regions and introns in Theileria are short, and their length distributions are
considerably right-skewed. Intergenic regions flanked by genes in 5'-5' orientation tend to be longer and
slightly more AT-rich than those flanked by two stop codons; intergenic regions flanked by genes in 3'-5'
orientation have intermediate values of length and AT composition. Intron position is negatively correlated
with intron length, and positively correlated with GC content. Using stringent criteria, we identified a set
of high-quality orthologous non-coding sequences between T. parva and T. annulata, and determined the
distribution of selective constraints across regions, which are shown to be higher close to translation start
sites. A positive correlation between constraint and length in both intergenic regions and introns suggests
a tight control over length expansion of non-coding regions. Genome-wide searches for functional
elements revealed several conserved motifs in intergenic regions of Theileria genomes. Two such motifs
are preferentially located within the first 60 base pairs upstream of transcription start sites in T. parva, are
preferentially associated with specific protein functional categories, and have significant similarity to know
regulatory motifs in other species. These results suggest that these two motifs are likely to represent
transcription factor binding sites in Theileria.
Conclusion: Theileria genomes are highly compact, with selection seemingly favoring short introns and
intergenic regions. Three over-represented sequence motifs were independently identified in intergenic
regions of both Theileria species, and the evidence suggests that at least two of them play a role in
transcriptional control in T. parva. These are prime candidates for experimental validation of transcription
factor binding sites in this single-celled eukaryotic parasite. Sequences similar to two of these Theileria
motifs are conserved in Plasmodium hinting at the possibility of common regulatory machinery across the
phylum Apicomplexa.

Background
Species in the genus Theileria are the causative agents of
lymphoproliferative diseases in cattle. The high mortality and morbidity in cattle associated with these diseases
cause devastating socio-economic losses [1]. The species
that cause the largest economic burden are T. parva,
which causes East Coast fever, and T. annulata, which
causes tropical theileriosis. Both species are transmitted
by ticks and have complex intracellular life-cycles [2].
Two intracellular stages follow the introduction of sporozoite stage into mammalian hosts, the intra-lymphocytic schizont stage and the intra-erythrocytic
piroplasm stage. The schizont stage has a unique ability
to cause infected host cells to proliferate indefinitely,
resulting in a leukemia-like phenotype [3]. Stage differentiation takes place at the time of parasite transmission
to and from hosts, as well as during their establishment
and amplification within the host. It has been shown
that the molecular regulation of stage differentiation
could be targeted for the development of new disease
control strategies [4]. One such target are the regulators
of gene expression, since they may determine the progression through life-cycle stages. However, little is
known about the extent of, and the elements involved
in, transcriptional regulation in these protozoan parasites.
Theileria species are among several thousand unicellular
eukaryotic parasites in the phylum Apicomplexa, whose
members include Plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly
causative agent of malaria, and Toxoplasma gondii, one of
the most successful parasites, infecting more than 30% of
the human population and imposing a severe threat to
immuno-compromised individuals. Apicomplexans are
thought to have reduced transcriptional machinery relative to multicellular eukaryotes. The highly biased nucleotide composition of the apicomplexan genomes
sequenced to date hamper the detection of bona fide regulatory elements [5], thus making it difficult to assess the
extent of that reduction. Classical eukaryotic promoter
elements such as the TATA-box and the CAAT-box appear
to be absent in T. gondii and P. falciparum [6]. General
transcription factors such as TFIIA and most of the TATAbinding protein associated factors are not found in apicomplexan genomes [7]. Instead, non-canonical regulatory motifs are correlated with gene expression in T. gondii
[8]. However, recent studies that take into account the
genome composition and/or the timing of gene expression are uncovering novel conserved sequence motifs,
leading to a considerable expansion of the repertoire of
known and putative transcription regulators in this phylum [9-14]. In T. parva, a massively parallel signature
sequencing (MPSS) study indicates that the majority of
genes are transcriptionally active in the schizont stage, but
their transcription may not be stringently regulated and,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/582

instead, vary stochastically between different host cells or
time points. Active regulation of transcription was
observed only at certain classes of loci [15]. In T. annulata,
mobility shift assays have identified an element upstream
of the TamS1 gene that is a site of DNA-protein interactions during differentiation to the merozoite [16].
The complex life-cycle of Theileria poses a serious challenge to the development of a workable laboratory system, thus making it difficult to study the regulatory
mechanism and developmental biology of this organism.
Recently, the genome sequences of T. parva and T. annulata were published [17,18], enabling the study of the
unique biological characteristics of Theileria parasites
using systematic and global bioinformatics approaches.
The genomes of T. parva and T. annulata are ~8 Mb long,
with approximately 4000 genes each, identified through
both automated and manual annotation. The gene density in these two genomes is fairly high, with the annotated coding sequences comprising ~70% of the nuclear
DNA, introns ~10% and the remaining 20% consisting of
intergenic regions (IGRs) [17,18]. The short length of
Theileria IGRs, which average ~400 base pairs (bp), again
suggests a different mechanism of transcriptional regulation from those found in multi-cellular eukaryotes. More
importantly, these compact IGRs allow us to assess the
feasibility of finding regulatory sequences with an exhaustive scan of the non-coding segment of the genome, and
in the absence of comprehensive gene expression data.
In the current work, we try to understand the evolutionary
forces that determine the characteristic of non-coding
regions in Theileria, such as length, nucleotide composition and degree of conservation. Selective constraint is calculated based on alignment of orthologous IGRs and
introns of T. parva and T. annulata. In particular, this study
aimed to test whether sequence conservation in general,
and conserved sequence motifs in particular, are most
common in IGRs flanked by genes in head-to-head orientation, as expected if transcriptional regulation is an
important component in the regulation of gene expression in Theileria. We apply a de novo motif discovery algorithm to identify putative cis-regulatory elements in IGRs
and compare their conservation in two species. Candidate
motifs are then characterized based on their location relative to transcription start sites and the function of neighboring genes in T. parva, their similarity to known
transcription factor binding sites, and their distribution
pattern in different non-coding genomic regions. In this
first comprehensive study of non-coding sequence evolution and motif discovery in Theileria, we have demonstrated that selection favors short introns and IGRs, and
identified conserved sequence motifs whose role in gene
regulation can now be tested by experimental approaches.

Results
Characterization of non-coding DNA in T. parva and T.
annulata
The length and "guanine and cytosine" (GC) content of
introns and IGRs are similarly distributed in T. parva
(intron number = 10408; IGR number = 3982) and T.
annulata (intron number = 10816; IGR number = 3738).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/582

IGR length fits a lognormal distribution with estimated
modal value of 105 bp (Figure 1). The positive skew in the
length distribution suggests that selective pressure maintains IGRs small, possibly to minimize genome size. Alternatively, such a distribution could result from the
sporadic accumulation of large insertions in IGRs that are
gradually eroded by more frequent deletions. The distri-

intron length is biomodal, which probably results from the overlay of two independent distributions of small (mode = 55) and
large (mode = 80) introns, much like what had been documented for other organism [19]. Similar results are found in T. annulata (not shown).

bution of intron length is also right-skewed, but it is
bimodal, similar to what is observed in other eukaryotes
[19]. This suggests the presence of two distinct classes of
introns: short introns, which make up the majority of the
sample, with a modal value at 55 bp, and long introns,
with a modal value of 80 bp. The distribution of GC content is approximately normal for both introns and IGRs
(Figure 1). The average GC content across all IGRs is 26.2
Â± 6.4% and 24.0 Â± 6.5% in T. parva and T. annulata,
respectively, while the average in introns is slightly lower
(24.5 Â± 6.6% GC in T. parva and 22.4 Â± 6.9% GC in T.
annulata). The GC content in non-coding regions is ~10%
lower than the overall genome GC content in these species, which is approximately 34.1% in T. parva and 32.5%
in T. annulata [17,18]. This difference suggests a mutational bias towards adenine and thymine (AT) and/or the
accumulation of AT-rich regulatory motifs in non-coding
regions of the genome.
In order to study the evolution of non-coding regions,
homologous sequence segments between species are
required. Establishing homology between non-coding
regions is often difficult due to the lack of conserved landmarks that results from the accumulation of insertions,
deletions and substitutions. In addition, the exact location of IGRs and introns is uncertain due to the probabilistic nature of the gene models generated through
automated annotation. For this study, we identified a
high-quality subset of introns and IGRs for which homology could be inferred with high probability (see Methods). The remaining analyses in this section were
performed on this data subset, unless otherwise noted.
The GC content in this subset of IGRs and introns (Table
1) is lower than the overall average, suggesting that coding
regions that have not yet been identified are present in
regions currently identified as non-coding.
IGRs can be classified into three classes based on the orientation of the genes that flank them: 5'-5', 3'-3' or 5'-3',
when surrounded respectively by two start codons, two
termination codons or a start and a stop codon of successive genes. The length and GC content distributions differ
significantly among IGR classes (p < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis
test). IGR length increases with increasing number of start

codons (0, 1, or 2) flanking it (Figure 2A). This could be
due to errors in determining the correct start codon, with
the resulting gene models being consistently shorter than
the true genes. This hypothesis seems unlikely, as it would
result in IGRs enriched with coding segments, which in
turn should increase GC content. In fact, the opposite
trend in GC content is observed. In IGRs, GC content
decreases with the number of flanking start codons, such
that 5'-5' IGRs have the lowest %GC, 3'-3' IGRs have the
highest %GC, and %GC of 3'-5' IGRs falls in between
those of the other two classes (Figure 2B). A more likely
explanation for the length trend among the three IGR
classes is the preferential accumulation of functional
motifs upstream of genes, causing 5'-5' IGR to be longest
and 3'-3' IGRs to be the shortest. This hypothesis is supported by the significant difference in selective constraint
across IGR classes (see below).
Intron length has been shown to be negatively correlated
to intron ordinal number in Arabidopsis and in murids
[20,21], a pattern that can be attributed to the uneven distribution of functional DNA elements across introns, with
larger fractions present towards the 5' end of genes. A similar relationship is observed in Theileria, with the average
length for first introns being 108 bp, and that value gradually decreasing to 94 bp, 92 bp, 87 bp and 84 bp for
intron ordinal number 2, 3, 4 and â¥ 5, respectively (Figure
3A). In addition, GC content is positively related with
intron position (Figure 3B). Both intron length and GC
content differ significantly among different classes of
introns (p < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test).
The degree of selective constraint was estimated for each
high-quality, orthologous intron pair (n = 1487) and IGR
pair (n = 990), based on individual global alignments.
Our results show the degree of conservation to be higher
in IGRs than in introns (Table 1). Interestingly, selective
constraint in IGRs of T. parva increases with the number
of start codons that flank it (Figure 2C), and decreases
with intron ordinal number (Figure 3C). The difference is
statistically significant among different classes of IGRs
and among introns (p < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). These
results point to the accumulation of functional motifs
upstream of genes and also in introns that are closer to the

Length, GC content and selective constraint distributions in three classes of intergenic regions in T. parva. Distribution of length (A), GC content (B) and selective constraint (C) per class of intergenic region (IGR) are depicted by boxplots. The three IGR classes (5'-5', 3'-5', 3'-3') are named according to the orientation of the flanking genes. Each box
(interquartile range, IQR) contains the sample's 25% to 75% range (quartiles Q1 to Q3, respectively), with the bottleneck
placed at the sample median. Horizontal tick marks show the range of all elements within Q1-1.5*IQR and Q3+1.5*IQR. Open
circles mark data points outside this range, which are considered outliers. The width of the bottleneck (i.e the length of the Vshaped notch) is an indication of the confidence of the median; a lack of overlap of the bottleneck between samples implies that
the medians are significantly different at ~95% confidence level. Similar results are found in T. annulata (not shown).

5' end of genes, and are consistent with the assertion of a
direct relationship between the length of non-coding
regions and the frequency of functional motifs.
Conserved Sequence Motifs and their Biological Relevance
Using MEME, we mined the 300 nucleotides proximal to
the 5' end of all genes in either T. parva or T. annulata for
enriched motifs. Given the average IGR length of ~400 bp,
this length restriction used in the initial motif search
should adequately capture relevant regulatory regions,
while at the same time minimizing the probability of
motifs affecting neighboring genes. Table 2 lists the top
five statistically significant motifs found in each species.
Motifs 1, 2, 3 in T. parva and motifs 1, 2, 4 in T. annulata
are found in hundreds of copies per genome in the
upstream region of genes, while the frequency of other
two motifs is an order of magnitude lower (Table 2).
Motif comparison indicates that top three motifs in T.
parva are almost identical to motifs 1, 2 and 4 in T. annulata (Figure 4). We further investigated the biological relevance of these three conserved motifs using transcription
start site (TSS) and gene functional annotation information.

First, we looked for an association between putative
motifs and the transcriptional process by determining
whether they had a fixed position relative to the TSS [22].
Putative TSSs have been determined for 650 T. parva genes
based on EST mapping, and on average map 138 nucleotides upstream of the start codon. T. parva motifs 1, 2
and 3 were present in IGRs next to, respectively, 132, 168
and 67 of the 650 genes with a defined UTR. Figure 5
shows the distribution of three motifs relative to the TSS.
The distribution of motif 1 is remarkably restricted, with
motifs almost exclusively located within 60 bases
upstream of the TSS. Motif 3 is also enriched in this
region, with more than 50% of the sequences located

within this 60 bp range. However, the distribution of
motif 2 is relatively flat, with ~70% of the sequences
located upstream of the TSS and the remaining 30%
located between the TSS and the initiation codon (Figure
5).
Next, we investigated the biological relevance for each
motif in the context of the function of adjacent genes. A
hypergeometric test demonstrated that certain functional
categories are significantly enriched among genes downstream of motifs 1 and 3 (p < 0.01), but not of motif 2.
Motif 1 is associated with genes involved in protein synthesis, with telomeric ORFs, and with proteins containing
signal peptides, while motif 3 is associated with genes
related to protein fate (Additional file 1). Using STAMP
[23], we identified known motifs that are most similar to
each of the three Theileria motifs. Motif 1 has similarity to
a DNA consensus binding site for myeloid zinc finger protein 1 (MZF1), a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor
involved in granulopoiesis, cellular proliferation and
oncogenesis [24] (Figure 4). In addition, motif 1 is identical to the motif ATGGGGC, which has been identified
independently in different studies in Plasmodium
[11,14,25] and which may be preferentially associated
with metabolic genes that are highly expressed during the
trophozoite stage [14]. For motif 2, STAMP detected a
highly similar sequence element that is known to interact
with a nuclear protein in a plant species [26] (Figure 4). It
is also nearly identical with a P. falciparum conserved
motif TGTGT(G/A)(A/T) which, much like motif 2, has a
widespread genome distribution [14]. Motif 3 has significant similarity to the binding site for NF-ÎºB, a family of
transcription factors whose activation has been shown to
be associated with host invasion in various pathogens,
including T. parva [27] (Figure 4).

Functional and structural annotations enriched in downstream genes of each T. parva motif are shown on the right.

Finally, we investigated the distribution pattern of three
motifs across the entire T. parva genome. MAST was used
to detect occurrence of each motif in coding regions
(CDS), introns, and the three types of IGRs, at different
probability thresholds. All three motifs were found more
often in 5'-5' and 5'-3' IGRs than in the other regions (Figure 6). Together with the higher selective constraints
observed in IGRs bordered by 5' ends of genes, these
results are consistent with the presence of regulatory
motifs in the upstream region of genes. Although the average length of CDS (1407 bp) is much longer than that of
IGRs (407 bp), the frequency of the three motifs is higher
in 5'-5' and 3'-5' IGRs than in CDS (Figure 6). This distribution pattern provides an additional evidence for the
biological significance of our putative motifs. In addition
to its presence in IGRs flanked by at least one start codon,
motif 2 is also found in 3'-3' IGRs and in introns, revealing a widespread distribution throughout non-coding
regions of the T. parva genome.

Discussion
The fraction of non-coding DNA in the majority of bacterial and archaeal genomes is between 6% and 14%, but
close to 90% in multicellular eukaryotes [28]. Singlecelled eukaryotes have a higher proportion of non-coding
DNA than prokaryotes, but a much more compact
genome than multicellular eukaryotes. The smallest
known nuclear genome, that of a chlorarachniophyte
nucleomorph, contains 22% intergenic DNA [29], and
the single-celled model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
the budding yeast, contains 30% intergenic DNA [30].
Intron length and number varies among taxa, and dramatic difference can be seen across related species.
Approximately 40% of genes contain introns in the fission
yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, while only 4% of genes

have introns in S. cerevisiae [30]. The non-protein coding
regions of multi-cellular eukaryotes include the remnants
of transposable elements that have lost functionality,
ribosomal genes, motifs involved in gene regulation and
chromosomal structure and possibly other unknown
functions. Only a few eukaryotic unicellular parasites
have so far been shown to contain transposable elements
[31-34], and many of these organisms are known to lack
transposable elements all together [17,35,36], which
probably explains much of the observed difference in the
amount of non-coding DNA between these organisms
and other eukaryotes. However, non-coding regions of
these small parasitic genomes remain remarkably understudied, and little is known about the forces that shape
them.
The genome of Theileria species is highly compact. Noncoding sequences make up ~30% of the genome, as the
average length of both introns and IGRs is smaller than
that of many eukaryote genomes, and no transposable
elements have so far been found. Our results show that a
large fraction of non-coding DNA is kept constant due to
purifying selection (Table 1). This high conservation rate
confirms the functional importance of non-coding
sequences in Theileria, which goes beyond a role as passive
intergenic spacers. This assertion is further supported by
the higher degree of sequence conservation in IGRs that
border the 5' end of genes relative to what is observed in
IGRs flanked by termination codons, since IGR sequence
conservation between species in regions upstream of
genes is associated with the presence of regulatory elements [37]. The presence of functionally important motifs
at higher frequencies in 5'-5' IGRs relative to 3'-3' IGRs
limits the fixation of deletion events in the former regions,
which in turn remain longer.

Position Relative to TSS
Distribution of conserved sequence motifs with respect to putative transcription start sites in T. parva
Figure 5
Distribution of conserved sequence motifs with respect to putative transcription start sites in T. parva. The distances between the first base of each motif and the TSS were determined for all genes for which both types of information
were available. Distances are binned in 10-bp intervals. The frequency is determined based on 132 sites for motif 1, 168 sites
for motif 2, and 67 sites for motif 3.
Introns play an important role in gene transcription regulation and mRNA processing, and functional elements are
often found in first introns [38,39]. First introns tend to
be longer and more conserved than introns of higher ordinal number, a pattern observed both in mammals [21]
and in invertebrates [40]. Our analyses yielded a similar
result in Theileria, extending this pattern to unicellular
eukaryotes for the first time. These results also suggest the
accumulation of functional elements towards the 5' end
of Theileria genes.
The study of transcriptional regulation in apicomplexan
parasites has identified some unique features of this large
group of protists. Canonical elements seem to be absent
from promoter regions, while non-canonical regulatory
elements in upstream regions have been found to be
involved in the regulation of gene expression. Transcriptome analysis has demonstrated active regulation of transcription in T. parva [15], but no regulatory elements or
transcription factors have been identified so far.

In this study, we found three putative motifs that are
present in hundreds of copies throughout the genome.
Two of them, motifs 1 and 3 in T. parva, are preferentially
located in the 60 nucleotides upstream of TSS, suggesting
that they may be transcription factor binding sites in this
species. Motif 1 appears to be enriched near telomereassociated ORFs and signal peptide-containing proteins.
While the function of telomeric ORFs in Theileria, so
called due to their extreme proximity to telomeres,
remains unknown they encode hyper-polymorphic gene
families [41]. In Plasmodium, gene families with these
characteristics are known to be important to pathogenesis
and antigenic variation [42,43]. In fact, a large fraction of
T. parva's telomeric ORFs expressed in the schizont stage
contain predicted signal sequences, consistent with their
involvement in host-parasite interaction [15]. The current
discovery of a putative regulatory element preferentially
located in upstream regions of telomeric ORFs may help
the functional study and design of molecular tools to
manipulate this important group of proteins in Theileria.
Based on a MIPS classification of T. parva proteins [15], we

regions, and introns using the MAST algorithm. Relative frequency of each type of sequence with at least one occurrence of a
motif is plotted as a function of the MAST E-value cutoff.

detected an association of this motif with genes involved
in protein synthesis, and database searches indicated that
it is similar to a DNA consensus binding site for myeloid
zinc finger protein 1 (MZF1), a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor involved in cellular proliferation and
oncogenesis [24]. The finding of an identical motif in Plasmodium associated with genes that are highly expressed
during phases of rapid cellular multiplication makes it
tempting to speculate whether motif 1 may be the binding
site for an unidentified transcription factor in Theileria
associated with protein synthesis and/or cell division.
Motif 3 appears to be associated with genes that are
involved in protein modification, stabilization, degradation, targeting, sorting, translocation, and other protein
fate-related functions. It is similar to the binding site for
NF-ÎºB transcription factors, which has been shown to be
involved in host cell transformation mechanisms in various pathogens, including Theileria [27]. The schizont stage
of T. parva induces sustained activation of NF-ÎºB, which
regulates the expression of genes involved in immune and
inflammatory responses [44], proliferation [45], and survival [46]. Pathogens may also utilize the NF-ÎºB system to
enhance their own replication, survival, and dissemination within the host [47]. For example, NF-ÎºB binding
sites have been found in the enhancer region of the long
terminal repeat [48] and 5' UTR [49] of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), through which host NF-ÎºB promotes viral replication and survival. Although no
homolog to human NF-ÎºB has been identified in Theileria,
it is conceivable that a transcription factor with a similar
binding motif to that used by NF-ÎºB might exist in these
species. To that effect we searched the T. parva proteincoding genes for peptides with homology to the IPT
domain of NF-ÎºB, which is involved in DNA binding. Our
BLASTP analysis uncovered a significant match (E = 3.7e5) to a hypothetical protein, TP02-0125, which has 33%
identity and 55% similarity to the DNA-binding domain
of NF-ÎºB. A support vector machine-based algorithm predicted TP02-0125 to be a DNA-binding protein [50]. This
result, together with the distribution characteristics of
motif 3, suggests that attempting the experimental validation of this motif is warranted.
In contrast with the previous two motifs, motif 2 is found
throughout non-coding regions, without a localized distribution relative to TSS or specific protein functional
classes. However, an almost identical motif has been demonstrated to interact with a nuclear protein in developing
rape seeds [18], suggesting the role of our motif as a binding site for regulatory proteins other than transcription
factors. Interestingly, our motif is highly similar to a conserved motif in P. falciparum that also has a widespread
genome distribution [14,51]. While it is possible that this
sequence pattern is a characteristic feature of apicomplexan genomes, its function remains unknown.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/582

As more Theileria genome sequences become available,
the search for conserved motifs in non-coding sequences
will have added power. A comprehensive list of conserved
elements may be derived by combining phylogenetic footprinting and de novo pattern matching algorithms. Various
experimental approaches are available for the verification
of putative regulatory elements, including in vitro protein
binding experiments, in vivo DNA structure assays, and
reverse genetics methods. In particular electrophoretic
mobility shift essays have been documented to work well
in apicomplexan systems [9,11,16]. Revealing the functional potential of these conserved elements will advance
the study of gene regulation in Theileria and possibly lead
to the improved control and therapeutics for East Coast
Fever and tropical therileriosis in cattle.

Conclusion
The highly compact genome of Theileria seems to result
from selection pressure for small introns and IGRs. While,
much like in other apicomplexan genomes, classical
eukaryotic promoter elements have not been found in
Theileria, genome-wide de novo searches identified several
conserved sequence motifs in IGRs. Two putative T. parva
motifs have localized distribution relative to transcriptional start sites and are preferentially associated with specific protein functions, which is consistent with the
hypothesis that they participate in transcriptional regulation in this eukaryotic parasite. The fact that conserved
motifs with similar sequence are found in Plasmodium
hints at the possibility of common regulatory mechanisms across the phylum Apicomplexa.

Methods
Sequence Data
An in-house database was developed to store and analyze
genome sequences and annotations of two Theileria species. There are 4011 annotated genes in T. parva, with
10408 introns. 5' and 3' UTR information is available for
650 and 545 genes, respectively. The total number of
IGRs, defined as complete DNA sequences between start
and/or stop codons of two consecutive annotated genes, is
3982 in T. parva. T. annulata has 3784 annotated genes,
with 10816 introns and a total of 3738 IGRs. Transfer and
ribosomal RNA genes were also excluded from IGRs.
Homology Identification
Orthologous clusters (OCs) were created using the publicly available gene annotations of six apicomplexan
genomes, namely T. parva, T. annulata, Babesia bovis, Plasmodium falciparum (version released with PlasmoDB 5.0
Beta), Plasmodium yoelii, and Cryptosporidium parvum.
Except for P. falciparum, the original genome annotation
release was used for each species. Jaccard-filtered OC analysis [52] was used to construct the final ortholog set, and
resulted in 3137 OCs containing at least one gene from
each of the two Theileria species (Jaccard filter cutoff at
Page 11 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:582

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/582

0.6). OCs with paralogs in Theileria were excluded, and
2904 OCs were retained that include exactly one gene
from each species. OCs were also excluded if the ratio of
the shortest to the longest of the two Theileria genes was
smaller than 0.9. Genes eliminated by this criterion are
likely to have an incorrect structural gene annotation in
one or both species, or to contain repeats that render
sequence alignment questionable. The final set of highquality OCs contains 1956 genes, with one sequence each
in T. parva and in T. annulata.
A high-quality (HQ) set of orthologous non-coding
regions was then defined as follows: HQ orthologous
IGRs are flanked by HQ OCs at both ends. HQ orthologous introns are those from HQ OCs with the same
number of introns in both species; in addition, HQ
orthologous introns are flanked by exon regions in which
amino acid similarity is â¥ 75% between species. This cutoff was determined empirically and resulted in the elimination of 25% of introns. The final dataset contains 990
pairs of HQ orthologous IGRs and 1487 pairs of HQ
orthologous introns.
Selective Constraint
Orthologous non-coding sequences were aligned using
Owen [53], to generate global alignments consisting of
segments with significant sequence similarity (p < 0.001),
also called hits, interspersed with segments for which
sequence similarity was below that significance threshold.
Selective constraint, c, in IGRs and introns was estimated
according to Shabalina and Kondrashov [54]. It is defined
as the fraction of invariant nucleotides within a sequence
segment. Given a similarity (s) within a hit defined as the
number of matches divided by the length of the shorter
sequence (lshort), and the probability r that a site is identi-

cal between two sequences due to non-deterministic reasons, selective constraint within a hit is estimated as
l

s
s
c short = 1â r for shorter sequence and c long = lshort * 1â r
âr
âr
long

for longer sequence. In this study, we estimated r from the
similarity in third codon positions of 4-fold degenerate
amino acids in HQ OCs between the two Therileria species; these should correspond mostly to sites that are identical due to chance or because not enough time has
elapsed since the two species split for substitutions to
occur. For an IGR or intron having n hits, the selective
constraint is defined as the sum, over all n hits, of the total
number of constrained nucleotides divided by the length
L of non-coding sequence in either species,

[55].

Motif Discovery
Although computational motif discovery approaches
have traditionally been used to find over-represented patterns among co-regulated genes, they may also be applied
to large sets of unrelated promoter regions [56]. In the current study, we retrieved up to 300 bases of IGRs flanking
the translation start sites of all T. parva and T. annulata
genes and used MEME (Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation)
to search for over-represented motifs on both DNA
strands. The search was done separately for each species.
MEME looks for conserved ungapped blocks in a group of
sequences using an iterative expectation-maximization
algorithm [57]. A background model is used by MEME to
calculate the log likelihood ratio and statistical significance of a motif. The model used in our search is a firstorder Markov chain derived from all intergenic sequences
in T. parva and T. annulata respectively. We assume the
presence of either zero or one motif per sequence, with
motif width between 5â15 bp. Putative motifs found in
two species were compared by the Smith-Waterman local
alignment method with similarity score defined by Pearson's correlation coefficient [23].
Biological Relevance of Putative Motifs
Putative motifs were further investigated in terms of their
location distribution in relation to TSS, functional characterization of downstream genes, similarity to known transcription factor binding sites, and occurrence pattern in
different non-coding genomic regions. These four analyses were performed in T. parva only. First, we retrieved all
T. parva genes with putative TSSs information available
and looked at the intersection between these genes and
our set of putative motifs. Distance between the first base
of a motif and TSS was calculated and binned in 10-bp
intervals. Localized distribution of motifs in relation to
TSS will provide evidence for the biological relevance of
putative motifs.

Secondly, we investigated if any specific gene function(s)
is over-represented in the region downstream of each
motif. T. parva genes have been previously annotated
based on the Munich Information Centre for Protein
Sequences (MIPS) catalog and Signal P software had been
used to predict the existence of signal peptides/signal
anchors in expressed genes [15]. We tested functional
over-representation in terms of 9 MIPS categories, telomere association and signal peptide/signal anchor information associated with the group of genes whose 5' IGRs
contain a particular motif. The statistical significance is
measured by a test for hypergeometric distribution
(Fisher's exact test). If R genes have been annotated with
an annotation category and the total number of unique
genes in the genome is N, then the p-value of finding at
least t genes with the annotation category among m genes
with the motif of interest in their upstream regions is:

As multiple functional catagories were tested simultaneously, p-values are corrected for multiple hypotheses testing using a Bonferroni approach. The calculation was
done using the function phyper in the statistical language
R.
In the third analysis, we identified known motifs with significant similarity to our putative motifs using the web
tool STAMP [23]. T. parva motifs were searched against a
collection of databases including two comprehensive
eukaryotic motif databases JASPAR [58] and TRANSFAC
[59], drosophila DNase I footprint database FlyReg [60],
plant motif databases PLACE [61] and AthaMap [62],
prokaryotic motif databases RegTransBase [63] and DPInteract [64], as well as yeast motifs predicted by Harbison
et al [65] and MacIsaac et al [66]. Motif similarity was estimated by the Smith-Waterman local alignment method
with similarity score defined by Pearson's correlation
coefficient. The significance is estimated based on simulated position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) models [67].
Lastly, we used MAST (Motif Alignment and Search Tool)
to find all occurrences of each putative motif in T. parva
non-coding regions [68]. The E-value of a match in an IGR
or intron to a motif is based on a random sequence model
derived from all non-coding sequences in T. parva. Various E-value cutoffs are used to retrieve matches with different statistical significance.
