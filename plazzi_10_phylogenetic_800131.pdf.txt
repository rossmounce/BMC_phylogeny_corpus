Phylogenetic representativeness: a new method
for evaluating taxon sampling in evolutionary
studies
Methodology article

Abstract
Background: Taxon sampling is a major concern in phylogenetic studies. Incomplete, biased, or improper taxon
sampling can lead to misleading results in reconstructing evolutionary relationships. Several theoretical methods are
available to optimize taxon choice in phylogenetic analyses. However, most involve some knowledge about the
genetic relationships of the group of interest (i.e., the ingroup), or even a well-established phylogeny itself; these data
are not always available in general phylogenetic applications.
Results: We propose a new method to assess taxon sampling developing Clarke and Warwick statistics. This method
aims to measure the "phylogenetic representativeness" of a given sample or set of samples and it is based entirely on
the pre-existing available taxonomy of the ingroup, which is commonly known to investigators. Moreover, our method
also accounts for instability and discordance in taxonomies. A Python-based script suite, called PhyRe, has been
developed to implement all analyses we describe in this paper.
Conclusions: We show that this method is sensitive and allows direct discrimination between representative and
unrepresentative samples. It is also informative about the addition of taxa to improve taxonomic coverage of the
ingroup. Provided that the investigators' expertise is mandatory in this field, phylogenetic representativeness makes up
an objective touchstone in planning phylogenetic studies.
Background
The study of phylogenetics has a long tradition in evolutionary biology and countless statistical, mathematical,
and bioinformatic approaches have been developed to
deal with the increasing amount of available data. The
different statistical and computational methods reflect
different ways of thinking about the phylogeny itself, but
the issue of "how to treat data" has often overshadowed
another question, i.e., "where to collect data from?". We
are not talking about the various types of phylogenetic
information, such as molecular or morphological characters, but rather we refer to which samples should be analyzed.
In phylogenetic studies, investigators generally analyze
subsets of species. For example, a few species are chosen
to represent a family or another high-level taxon, or a few

individuals to represent a low-level taxon, such as a genus
or a section. As a general practice, choices are driven by
expertise and knowledge about the group; key species
and taxa of interest are determined and, possibly, sampled. For example, if a biologist is choosing a group of
species to represent a given class, species from many different orders and families will be included. We term the
degree to which this occurs the "phylogenetic representativeness" of a given sample.
This issue is rarely formally addressed and generally
treated in a rather subjective way; nevertheless, this is one
of the most frequent ways incongruent phylogenetic
results are accounted for. It is sufficient to browse an evolutionary biology journal to see how often incorrect or
biased taxon sampling is hypothesized to be the cause
[e.g., [1-6]]. We therefore aim to set up a rigorous taxon
sampling method, which can be used alongside expertisedriven choices. Many theoretical approaches have been
proposed to drive taxon sampling: see [[7]; and reference
therein] for a keystone review.

The concept of "taxonomic distinctness" was developed
in the early 1990s among conservation biologists [8,9],
who needed to measure biodiversity within a given site or
sample so to assess further actions and researches. Basic
measures of biodiversity take into account species richness and relative abundance [10-13]. However, it is clear
from a conservationist point of view that not all species
should be weighted the same. The presence and relative
abundance of a species cannot capture all information on
the variation of a given sample, and therefore a taxonomic component must also be considered in evaluating
the biodiversity of a given site. This allows more realistic
specification of the importance of a species in a given
assemblage.
Similarly, resources for conservation biology are limited, and therefore it is important to focus on key species
and ecosystems according to a formal criterion. For this
purpose, several methods have recently been proposed
[14-17]. Despite recent progresses in sequencing techniques, it is still worth following a criterion of "maximizing representativeness" to best concentrate on key taxa
[e.g., [17]]. Nevertheless, this typically requires a well
established phylogeny, or at least a genetic distance
matrix, as a benchmark. These data are indeed generally
available for model species or taxa with key ecological
roles, but they are often unavailable in standard phylogenetic analyses. Typically, if we want to investigate a phylogeny, it has either never been resolved before, or it has
not been completely assessed at the moment we start the
analysis. Further, if a reliable and widely accepted phylogenetic hypothesis were available for the studied group,
we probably would not even try to attempt to formulate
one at all. This means that, while the above-mentioned
methods may be useful in the case of well-characterized
groups, an approach using taxonomic distinctness is
more powerful in general phylogenetic practice.
Our basic idea is that estimating the phylogenetic representativeness of a given sample is not conceptually different from estimating its taxonomic distinctness. A
certain degree of taxonomic distinctness is required for
individual samples chosen for phylogenetic analyses;
again, investigators attempt to spread sampling as widely
as possible over the group on which they are focusing in
order to maximize the representativeness of their study.
A computable measure of taxonomic distinctness is
required to describe this sampling breadth.
In this article we propose a measure of phylogenetic
representativeness, and we provide the software to implement it. The procedure has the great advantage of requiring only limited taxonomical knowledge, as is typically
available in new phylogenetic works.

Results
Algorithm

Clarke and Warwick [18] suggest standardizing the step
lengths in a taxonomic tree structure by setting the longest path (i.e., two species connected at the highest possible level of the tree) to an arbitrary number. Generally,
this number is 100. Step lengths can be weighted all the
same, making the standardized length measure to equal:
ln =

100
2( T −1 )

where T is the number of taxonomic levels considered
in the tree and n = 1, 2, ..., N, where N is the number of
steps connecting a pair of taxa (see Methods). All taxa in
the tree belong by definition to the same uppermost
taxon. Therefore, two taxa can be connected by a maximum of 2(T - 1) steps.
However, it is also possible to set step lengths proportionally to the loss of biodiversity between two consecutive hierarchical levels, i.e., the decrease in the number of
taxa contained in each one, as measured on the master
list. Branch lengths are then computed as follows: we
indicate S(t) as the number of taxa of rank t, with t = 1, 2,
..., T from the lowest to the highest taxonomic level. Two
cases are trivial: when t = 1, S(t) equals to S (the number of
Operational Taxonomic Units - OTUs - in the master
taxonomic tree); when t = T, S(t) equals to 1 (all taxa
belong to the uppermost level). The loss of biodiversity
from level t to level t + 1 is:
ΔS(t) = S(t) − S(t+1) ( 1 ≤ t ≤ T − 1 )

The step length from level t + 1 to level t is the same as
from level t to level t + 1. Therefore, path lengths are then
obtained as:
ΔS(t)
×100
T −1
∑ ΔS(t)
ΔS(t)
t =1
l t = l t* =
=
× 50, t* = N − t + 1
T −1
2
∑ ΔS(t)
t =1

where lt is the path length from level t to level t + 1 and
lt* is the reverse path length.
Clarke and Warwick [18] found the method of weighting step lengths to have little effect on final results. However, we find that standardizing path lengths improves

the method in that it also complements subjectivity in
taxonomies; rankings are often unrelated even across
closely-related groups. To us, this is the main reason for
standardizing path lengths. Moreover, adding a level in a
taxonomic tree does not lead to changes in the mean or
standard deviation of taxonomic distance (AvTD or
VarTD) if we adopt this strategy. In addition, the insertion of a redundant subdivision cannot alter the values of
the indices [18]. All these analyses are carried out by our
PhyRe script (Additional file 1).
Our method based on Clarke and Warwick's ecological
indices has the main feature of being dependent only
upon a known existing taxonomy. This leads to a key difficulty: taxonomic structures are largely subjective constructions. Nonetheless, we think that taxonomists'
expertise has provided high stability to main biological
classifications, at least for commonly-studied organisms,
such as animals and plants. The degree of agreement
which is now reached in those fields allows us to consider
most systematics as stable. In our view, large-scale rearrangements are becoming more and more unlikely, so
that this argument leads us to state that present taxonomies do constitute an affordable starting point for methods of phylogenetic representativeness assessment.
However, this is not sufficient to completely ensure the
reliability of our method. Knowledge is growing in all
fields of evolutionary biology, and the increase in data
results in constant refinement of established classifications. In fact, even if large-scale changes are rare, taxonomies are frequently revised, updated, or improved.
Therefore, we implemented an algorithm that allows for
testing the stability of the chosen reference taxonomy.
Essentially, our procedure can be described in two
phases. In the first one, the shuffling phase, master lists
are shuffled, resulting in a large number of alternative
master lists. In the second, the analysis phase, a phylogenetic representativeness analysis is carried out as
described above across all simulated master lists rearrangements. The shuffling phase is composed of three
moves, which are repeated and combined ad libitum (see
Methods). These moves simulate the commonest operations taxonomists do when reviewing a classification. A

large number of "reviewed" master lists is then produced,
repeating each time the same numbers of moves. Finally,
the shuffling phase ends with a set of master lists. Standard phylogenetic representativeness analyses are performed on each master list, and all statistics are
computed for each list. In this way, a set of measurements
is produced for each indicator. Therefore, it is possible to
compute standard 95% (two-tailed) confidence intervals
for each one. This analysis phase gives an idea of the funnel plot's oscillation width upon revision. PhyloSample
and PhyloAnalysis (Additional file 1) are specific scripts
dealing with the shuffling analysis: the former generates
the new set of master list, whereas the latter performs
PhyRe operations across them all.
All scripts are available online, and a Windows executable version of the main script is also present: the software can be downloaded from the MoZoo Lab web site at
http://www.mozoolab.net/index.php/software-download.html.
Testing

In order to evaluate the method, we analyze phylogenies
of bivalves [19], carnivores [20], coleoids [21], and termites [22]. Our reference taxonomies are Millard [23] for
mollusks, the Termites of the World list hosted at the
University of Toronto http://www.utoronto.ca/forest/termite/speclist.htm: consulted on 03/23/2009 and reference therein), and the online Checklist of the Mammals
of the World compiled by Robert B. Hole, Jr. (http://
www.interaktv.com/MAMMALS/Mamtitl.html:
consulted on 03/11/2009 and reference therein).
Results from AvTD and VarTD are shown in Figures 1
and 2, respectively. Funnel plot are based arbitrarily on
100 random samplings from the master list for each sample size. Table 1 summarizes these results, showing also
results from IE.
To assess the stability of our taxonomies by performing
shuffling analyses on them, we fixed the amount of
"moves" to be executed according to our knowledge of
each master list (see Discussion for details; Table 2); 1,000
new "reviewed" datasets were generated and then 100
replicates were again extracted from each master list for

each sample size. Funnel plots for AvTD and VarTD are
shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively.
We conducted additional analyses on the dataset of
bivalves with real and simulated data (Additional file 2).
Data from bivalve phylogenies obtained in our laboratory
at different times from different samples have been tested
along with imaginary samples of different known representativeness. We use the letter R to denote real data sets
analyzed in our laboratory. Datasets from R1 to R4 are
increasingly representative. In R1, the subclass of Protobranchia is represented by just one genus, and the subclass of Anomalodesmata is completely missing. In R2,
we add one more genus to Protobranchia (Solemya) and
one genus to Anomalodesmata (Thracia). In R3, the sample is expanded with several Genera from Unionidae

(Anodonta, Hyriopsis), Heterodonta (Gemma, Mactra),
Protobranchia (Nuculana; but see [24,25]), and more
Anomalodesmata (Pandora, Cuspidaria). While all highlevel taxa were already represented in R2, R3 is thus wider
and more balanced in terms of sampling. R4 is identical
to R3 with the exception of genus Cerastoderma, which
was excluded due to technical problems.
Simulated data sets are indicated by the letter S. S1 is an
"ideal" data set: all subclasses are represented with 4 species and 4 families, although the number of represented
orders is different across the subclasses. S2 is biased
towards less biodiversity-rich subclasses: it comprehends
6 anomalodesmatans, 6 palaeoheterodonts, and 7 protobranchs, along with only 1 pteriomorphian and one heterodont. S3 is strongly biased towards heterodonts, with

17 genera. Pteriomorphians, palaeoheterodonts, and protobranchs are represented by one genus each, and there
are no anomalodesmatans here. S4 is an "easy-to-get"
sample, with the commonest and well-known genera
(e.g., Donax, Chamelea, Teredo, Mytilus, Ostrea), and
therefore it is composed only by pteriomorphians (7 genera) and heterodonts (11 genera).
For this entire group of samples, from R1 to R4, and
from S1 to S4, we conducted phylogenetic representativeness analyses to find out whether the method can
describe samples following our expectations. Funnel plots
were constructed on 10,000 replicates. Results are displayed in Figure 5 and Table 3.

Implementation

The distribution of AvTD from k random subsamples of
size S is typically left-skewed ([26]; Figure 6). This is not
an effect of a low k, as increasing the number of subsamples the shape of distribution does not change. We follow
Azzalini [27] in describing the skeweness with a parameter λ. The further is λ (as absolute value) from unity, the
more skewed is the distribution. Using the master list of
bivalves and a dimension S of 50, we estimated an absolute value for λ which is very close to unity (~1.01, data
not shown), confirming that the distribution only slightly
differs from the normal one. However, this was done only
for one sample, and distributions vary across different

applied to VarTD.
We represent in our AvTD plots the lower 95% confidence limit (see Figures from 1 to 5). The maximum value
obtained across all replicates for that dimension is also
shown because it converges to the upper absolute limit as
k increases. Conversely, in VarTD plots the upper 95%
confidence limit and minimum observed value are
shown, as lower values of variation are preferable (see

Methods). PhyRe produces funnel plots showing results
from a range of dimensions S. This helps in evaluating the
global situation and is very useful for comparing homogeneous samples of different sizes.
For the shuffling analysis, similar funnel plots are produced. The main difference is that for AvTD the lower
95% confidence limit is not a line: here is shown the area
which comprises 95% of values for each dimension across
all shuffled master lists. The same applies for the AvTD

Discussion
"Taxon sampling" is not a new topic by itself and several
strategies have been proposed from different standpoints.
As mentioned above, several criteria have been appraised,
especially when an established phylogeny is present.
Long-branch subdivision [[28,29]; and reference therein],
for example, has been proposed as one strategy; see Hillis
[[7]; and reference therein] for more strategies. Much
experimental interest has been focused also on outgroup
sampling (see, e.g., [[30,31]; and reference therein], for
empirical studies) and its effects. Finally, whether it is
preferable to add more characters or more taxa is a vexing
question; several authors highlight the importance of
adding new taxa to analyses [e.g., [32,33]]. However,
Rokas and Carroll [34] point out that an increase in taxon
sampling does not have an improving effect per se. Never-

theless, they suggest several factors which may influence
the accuracy of phylogenetic reconstructions, and among
them the density of taxon sampling.
Rannala et al. [35] obtained more accurate phylogenetic
reconstructions when they sampled 20 taxa out of 200,
rather than when 200 taxa out of 200,000 were chosen for
analyses, although in the latter case the taxon number
was higher. This is rather intuitive, indeed, as taxon sampling is denser in the former case. Each taxon was sampled with the same probability ρ in a birth-death process
(see [35] for further details). Interestingly, this is somewhat similar to our random subsampling process: the
more dense is a sample, the more likely is it to be representative of its master list, despite the absolute number of
included taxa.
However, our approach is very different, because it is
completely a priori. The method can always be applied to
any phylogeny, given the presence of a reference taxonomy and a master list of taxa. We find useful to start from
the zero point of no phylogenetic information except for
the available taxonomy. Evolutionary systematics does

indeed capture some phylogenetic information, because
all taxonomic categories should correspond to monophyletic clades. We employ this preliminary phylogenetic
information to assess taxon sampling (but see below for
further discussion on this point).
This method can be applied to every kind of analysis,
from molecular to morphological ones. Furthermore,
even extinct taxa can be included in a master list or in a

sample: for example, the bivalve list from Millard [23]
does report fossil taxa, and we left those taxa in our reference master list, as these are part of the biodiversity of the
class. In fact, a good sample aims to capture the entire
diversity of the group, thus including extinct forms.
Therefore, we suggest that molecular samples should be
better compared to complete master lists, which comprehend both living and fossil taxa (see Figure 5).

Figure 6 Average Taxonomic Distinctness distribution. Histograms show frequencies of Average Taxonomic Distinctness (AvTD) values among k
= 100 (a), 1,000 (b), 10,000 (c), and 100,000 (d) random subsamples (S = 50) from bivalves' master list by Millard [23]. The distribution shows a skeweness
towards the left side.

Moreover, evaluating phylogenetic representativeness
as described here has the great advantage of being largely
size-independent: this is well shown by funnel plots of
AvTD and VarTD (Figures from 1 to 5). The mean is consistent across all dimensions S and it is very close to
AvTD or VarTD values obtained from the whole master
list (data not shown; see e.g., [26]). This fact, along with
setting path lengths proportionally to biodiversity losses
and rescaling their sum to 100, has a very useful and
important effect: adding new taxa or new taxonomic levels does not change any parameter in the analysis. This
means that more and more refined analyses can always be
addressed and compared with coarser ones and with
results from other data.
Most importantly, we checked the significance of both
AvTD and VarTD results with one-tailed tests. The original test was two-tailed [26], and this is the greatest difference between the original test and our implementation
for phylogenetic purposes. In the ecological context,
these indices are used to assess environmental situations,
to test for ecological stresses or pollution. In such a
framework, the index must point out assemblages which
are either very poor or very rich in terms of distinctness.
The former will constitute signals of critically degraded
habitats, whereas the latter will indicate a pristine and

particularly healthy locality, and ecologists seek explanations for both results.
In our applications, we want our sample to be representative of the studied group, so that a sample significantly
higher in taxonomic distinctness than a random one of
the same size can be very useful; indeed, it would be even
preferred. For this reason, we state that a one-tailed test is
more appropriate for our purposes.
All case studies rely on samples with good phylogenetic
representativeness. Nevertheless, one sample ([19]; Figure 1a and 2a) is relatively small to represent its master
list; this is shown by quite large funnels at its size. On the
other hand, one sample ([22]; Figure 1d and 2d) turned
out to be strikingly representative of its groups: the AvTD
is higher (and the VarTD lower) than the highest (lowest)
found in 100 random subsamples. We recommend the
former sample be taken with care for phylogenetic inferences (in fact, see [19] on the polyphyly of bivalves). Conversely, the latter sample is extremely more representative
than the other three. Highly representative samples are
readily individuated by AvTD and VarTD funnel plots
(see Figure 1d and 2d) as dots above the highest AvTD
and below the lowest VarTD found across all random
replicates.
This is naturally influenced by the number of such subsamples: the more subsamples that are drawn, the more

Plazzi et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:209
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/209

likely is to find the absolute maximum (minimum) possible value. If k is sufficiently high, the absolute maximum
(minimum) possible value is found for any dimension S,
and no sample can appear above (below) those lines (see
Figure 5). Therefore, we suggest to draw an intermediate
number of replicates (e.g., 100 or 1,000) to avoid this widening effect and identify more optimal phylogenetic samples.
Shuffling analysis assesses the complex issue of master
list subjectivity and, as such, taxonomy itself. Master lists
turn out to be substantially stable upon simulated revision, as shown in Figure 3 and 4. 95% confidence areas are
indeed generally narrow and the position of experimental
dots is never seriously challenged. We used 100 replicates
from 1,000 master lists: this turned out to be sufficient to
draw clear graphs, where borders are accurately traced.
An objective criterion to describe the amount of shuffling needed for this analysis is still lacking; however, each
group of living beings has its own taxonomic history and
its own open problems, therefore we think it can be very
difficult to find an always-optimal criterion. An expertise-driven choice cannot be ruled out here. We suggest
that, given the contingent conditions of a study, phylogeneticists choose the best degree of shuffling to describe
their master list's stability. Some taxonomical situations
are much more consolidated than others; in some cases
higher-level taxa are well-established, whereas in others
agreement has been reached on lower-level ones. A formal criterion, like moving 10% of species or merging 5%
of genera, will necessarily lose this faceting and complexity.
Interestingly, the coleoid master list revealed itself to be
the most sensitive to shuffling. The AvTD funnel plot
places the sample of [21] exactly across the mean line,
whereas it is close to the maximum line in the shuffling
analysis (see Figure 1c and 3c). This means that AvTD is
globally lowered upon shuffling on the coleoid master
list. In fact, whereas mean AvTD on the original master
list was close to 90 for all S, the 95% confidence interval
on shuffled master lists is always slightly under 85. Conversely, VarTD is over the mean in standard PhyRe computations, whereas it is across the minimum line in
shuffling analysis (see Figure 2c and 4c): VarTD mean
changes from about 300 in the former case to around 500
in the latter one. The amount of shuffling we applied (see
Table 2) is evidently heavy in this case. Therefore, upon a
taxonomic review, we would recommend to reconsider
this sample and to perform a new phylogenetic representativeness analyses.
Our method is also descriptive for comparing similar
samples; this is a smart way to test the improvement of a
phylogenetic study while adding one or more taxa to a
given sample. It is clear from our R1-R4 example (see Figure 5) the importance of adding just two taxa to the initial

Page 10 of 15

sample. The improvement is well depicted by AvTD and
VarTD funnel plots: whereas R1 is just across the AvTD
lower 95% confidence limit of AvTD, R2 is well above;
whereas R1 is outside the VarTD upper 95% confidence
limit, R2 is inside it. While VarTD remains close to the
confidence limit, R3 and R4 are nevertheless even more
representative in terms of AvTD, as they lie precisely on
the mean of 10,000 replicates. This reflects the increase
of sampled taxa with respect to several under-represented groups.
S1, the "ideal" sample, turns out to have the highest
AvTD (across the maximum line) and the lowest VarTD
(next to the minimum line). In this case, we have 10,000
replicates; thus, the above considerations hold true and
we do not expect our dot to be neither above nor below
the funnel plot for AvTD or VarTD, respectively. Sample
S2, biased towards less biodiversity-rich subclasses
appears to be representative: it is well inside both funnel
plots. Three subclasses out of five are well represented
here; this sample is therefore rather informative. However, it is clearly less preferable than sample S1; whereas
the former lies always across or next to the mean line, the
latter is always close to the observed extreme values.
Sample S3 seems reasonable in terms of VarTD, but the
AvTD funnel plot identifies it as the worst of all. Nevertheless, sample S4 (with two substantially equally-represented subclasses) turned out to be even worse than S3
(almost just one subclass included): it is below the 95%
confidence limit of AvTD and above the 95% confidence
limit of VarTD.
Thus, joint analysis of AvTD and VarTD provides discrimination between samples. An AvTD/VarTD plot
shows that these measures are generally negatively correlated, even if some exceptions are possible: good samples
have high AvTD and low VarTD values; the opposite is
true for bad samples (Figure 7).
Along with the two main measures, IE can give an
approximate idea of the shape of the tree. Values > 0.25
are often associated with biased samples (see Table 3),
and thus we suggest this as a rule of thumb for directly
discarding imbalanced ones. However, this cut-off value
is only a rough guide in estimating phylogenetic representativeness: sample R2 has an IE of 0.2804 (greater than
R1), but funnel plots identify it as a good bivalve sample.

Conclusions
Phylogenetic representativeness analyses can be conducted at every taxonomic level, and including any taxonomic category. Moreover, inclusion or exclusion of
taxonomic categories does not influence results across
analyses ([18]; see above). Although we did not present it
here, the index can also potentially take relative abundance data into account [see [36,37,26]]. Thus, it may be
implemented for population-level analyses as well,

phylogenetic study, from which subsequent analyses can
proceed further towards an affordable evolutionary tree.

depicting sampling coverage among different populations
from a given section, species, or subspecies.
The main strength of phylogenetic representativeness
approach lies in being an a priori strategy of taxon selection and sampling. Therefore, it cannot take into account
several empirical and experimental problems, which are
not guaranteed to be avoided. For example, long-branch
attraction depends essentially upon a particularly quick
rate of evolution in single taxa [38], which is only a posteriori identified. Moreover, topology alteration due to outgroup misspecification remains possible, as phylogenetic
representativeness deals only with ingroup taxa.
Each particular study copes with specific difficulties
strictly inherent to contingent conditions; for example, as
a result of an unexpected selective pressure, one particular locus may turn out to be completely uninformative,
even if the taxon sampling is perfectly adequate. Nevertheless, in R1-R4/S1-S4 examples (see above), our knowledge of bivalve evolution and systematics allows us to
discriminate between suitable and non-suitable samples,
and phylogenetic representativeness results matched perfectly with our expectations.
Moreover, being understood that expertise is always
expected in planning taxon sampling, we strongly suggest
to set phylogenetic representativeness alongside a formal
criterion for profiling phylogenetic informativeness of
characters [e.g., [39]]. Put in other words, phylogenetic
representativeness is a guarantee of a good and wise taxonomic coverage of the ingroup, but evidently it is not
guarantee of a good and robust phylogeny per se. For this
reason, we would suggest it as a springboard for every

Mathematical aspects of this index are well explained in
works by Clarke and Warwick [36,26,40]. However, it is
useful to explain here the main points of their statistics.
AvTD is computed starting from a taxonomic tree. A
taxonomic tree is merely the graphical representation of a
Linnean classification, whereby OTUs are arranged hierarchically into different categories or taxa, with taxa
being mutually exclusive. We use the general terms
"OTUs" and "taxa" because a taxonomic tree does not
necessarily include species at their tips, nor do all taxonomic trees take into account exactly the same levels of
systematics.
A simple taxonomic tree is depicted in Figure 8. Each
leaf is an OTU and each node is a taxon; for example,
OTUs may correspond to species and deeper nodes to
genera, families, and orders as we climb up the tree. On a
tree such as this, we can define a tree metric of taxonomic
distance between any given pair of OTUs. A taxonomic
tree is rooted (by definition); therefore, it is necessary to
specify that our tree metric is unrooted (see [16]), i.e., the
distance between two taxa is the shortest path on the tree
that leads from one to another, and it is not required to
climb up the tree from the first taxon to the root and then
down to the second one, otherwise all pairs of OTUs
would score the same distance.
Let us indicate with ωij the taxonomic distance between
OTUs i and j, which are joined by N steps (branches) on
the tree. Now we can define:
N

w ij =

∑l

n

n=1

Figure 8 A hypothetical taxonomic tree. Nine Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and four taxonomic levels are shown. For example,
levels 1-4 could correspond to species, genera, families, and orders, respectively; in this case, species 1, 2, and 3 would belong to the same
genus, species 1, 2, 3, and 4 to the same family, and so on. Taxonomic
paths connecting taxa 1 and 5 (thick lines) and taxa 4 and 8 (dashed
lines) are marked. See text for more details.

Plazzi et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:209
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/209

where ln is the length of the nth branch, n = 1, 2, ..., N.
We do not want to rely on information about mutation
rates nor genetic distances. If we consider that a Linnean
classification is mostly arbitrary, we can set branch
lengths in several ways. Further considerations on this
point are given above (Results; but see also [18]). The
simplest case is considering a length equal to 1 for all
branches. Accordingly, the distance between taxa 1 and 5
in Figure 8 is 4, and the distance between taxa 4 and 8 is 6.
Indeed, taxa 1 and 4 are more closely related than taxa 4
and 8 are. The Average Taxonomic Distinctness (AvTD)
of the tree is defined as the average of all such pairwise
distances:
S S
∑ ∑ w ij
i =1 j > i
AvTD =
S ( S −1 )
2

(modified from [26])
where S is the number of taxa in the tree. Given the
presence/absence data case, and with the distance
between taxa i and j, being i = j, set to 0 (same taxon), we
note that the formula can be reduced to the computationally simpler form:
S S
∑ ∑ w ij
i =1 j =1
AvTD =
S ( S −1 )

For example, the AvTD for the tree in Figure 8 would
equal approximately 5.0556. The original formulation of
the index considers also relative abundances of species,
but here we only take into account presence/absence of
OTUs.
This is the basic statistic described in this work. AvTD
has been shown to be a good ecological indicator and a
reliable estimator of biodiversity [37,41-43]. The most
appealing feature is its clear independence from sampling
effort ([36,37]; see Discussion above).
Test of significance

The AvTD statistic simply gives the expected path length
for a randomly selected pair of species from the set of S
species [26]. The higher the AvTD, the more taxonomically distinct is the sample. However, it is necessary to
compare the AvTD of a sample to the master list from
which it is taken; for example, we may be interested in the
molecular phylogeny of an order and we sampled and
sequenced S species within this order. Naturally, we wish
to maximize the number of families and genera repre-

Page 12 of 15

sented therein. Using the AvTD method, we can estimate
this "maximization" by computing the index for our sample of S species, and then comparing it with one computed from the list of all species belonging to the order
itself. However, comparing a pure number to another
pure number is rather uninformative; therefore, a random
resampling approach to test for significance is suggested
here. The rationale is as follows: we must estimate
whether our sample's AvTD (AvTDS) is significantly different from the master list's one. Although the index is
poorly dependent on sampling effort, we have to take into
account that often the master list is consistently bigger
than our sample. Thus, we draw k samples of size S from
master list. We then compute AvTD from all k sample
and test whether AvTDS falls within the 95% confidence
limits of the distribution (original two-tailed test; but see
Discussion above).
Variation in Taxonomic Distinctness (VarTD)

As noted by Clarke and Warwick [40], some differences
in the structure of the taxonomic trees of samples are not
fully resolved by AvTD measures. Two taxonomic trees
could have very different structures, in terms of subdivision of taxa into upper-level categories, but nevertheless
could have the same AvTD. Differences in taxonomic
structures of samples are well described by a further
index of biodiversity, the Variation in Taxonomic Distinctness (VarTD).
VarTD is computed as a standard statistical variance. It
captures the distribution of taxa between levels, and
should be added to AvTD in order to obtain a good measure of biodiversity. Clarke and Warwick [26] demonstrated that VarTD can be estimated via a precise
formula, but can also be obtained in the canonical statistical way from AvTD data.
Clarke and Warwick [40] proposed to follow the same
procedure as above: observed VarTD is compared with
values from random resamplings of the same size. Lower
values of VarTD are preferable, as they are an indication
of equal subdivision of taxa among intermediate levels.
Clarke and Warwick [40] also show that VarTD is not as
independent from sampling effort as AvTD is, i.e., there is
a bias towards lower values for very small S (see Figure 2
and 4), but it can be shown [40] that this bias becomes
rather negligible for S >10.
Von Euler's index of imbalance

Following the idea of AvTD, von Euler [44] proposed an
index related to taxonomic distinctness, which he called
an index of imbalance. An index of imbalance measures
the imbalance of the tree, i.e., whether and how much
certain groups are under-represented and certain others
are over-represented. This was not the first of such
indexes [e.g., [45-48]]; however, as noted by Mooers and

Plazzi et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:209
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/209

Heard [49], they do not apply to trees with polytomies, as
taxonomic trees often are. Von Euler's index of imbalance
(IE) is defined as:
IE =

AvTD max − AvTD
AvTD max − AvTD min

where AvTDmax and AvTDmin are respectively the maximum and minimum possible AvTDs given a particular
sample. AvTDmax is obtained from a totally-balanced tree
constructed on the given taxa, whereas AvTDmin is
obtained from a totally-imbalanced one.
Figure 9 depicts such trees as computed from the taxonomic tree shown in Figure 8; taxonomic levels are considered as orders, families, genera, and species. (i)
Obtaining a completely imbalanced tree. The procedure is
bottom-up. Each species is assigned to a different genus
(left side, thick lines, species 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), until the
number of "occupied" genera equals the total number of
genera minus one. Remaining species are then lumped in
the last genus (right side, thick lines, species 6, 7, 8, and
9). The same procedure is repeated in assigning genera to
families (dashed lines). As we consider only one order, all
families are lumped in it (dotted lines). More generally,
the procedure is repeated until the uppermost hierarchical level is reached. (ii) Obtaining a completely balanced
tree. The procedure is top-down. The first step is forced,
as all Families must be lumped in the only present order
(dotted lines). Then we proceed assigning (as far as possible) the same number of genera to each Family. In this
case, we have 6 genera for 3 families, therefore it is very
easy to see that the optimal distribution is 6/3 = 2 genera/
family (dashed lines). The same step is repeated until the
lowermost hierarchical level is reached. Each time we try
to optimize the number of taxa which are assigned to all
upper levels. We have in this case 9 species for 6 genera

trees. Totally-imbalanced (a) and totally-balanced (b) taxonomic trees

(thick lines). Necessarily we will have at best 3 genera
with 2 species and 3 genera with 1 species (3 × 2 + 3 × 1 =
9). The optimal situation is the one depicted in the figure.
For this reason, it is important to balance taxa not only
with respect to the immediately upper taxon, but also
with respect to all upper taxa. We note that the completely-balanced and completely-imbalanced trees may
not be unique. However, differences in AvTD from different equally-balanced or equally-imbalanced trees are null
or negligible.
As the original formulation of AvTD, von Euler's index
of imbalance was introduced in the conservation context,
since it was used to take estimates on the loss of evolutionary history, and was found to be strictly (negatively)
correlated with AvTD (pers. obs.; [44]). We introduce IE
in our topic, stating it is a useful balancing indicator for
samples used in phylogenetic studies.
Shuffling analysis

Shuffling analysis concepts and purposes are extensively
explained in the Results section. Here we think it is useful
to report algorithms that were written to carry it out,
especially for shuffling phase.
Shuffling phase

User inputs the number of shuffled master lists they want
to generate. The user must also decide the number of repetitions for each kind of move. Therefore, each of the following algorithms is repeated the given number of times
on the same master list. Then, the resulting file is saved to
disk and a new one is produced, with same modalities.
Move: Transfer
1. user is requested to input a taxon level t, with t
= 1, 2, ..., T - 1;
2. a taxon a of level t is randomly chosen;
3. if taxon A of level t + 1 containing a contains
only a
then return to 2;
else proceed to 4;
4. a taxon B of level t + 1 is randomly chosen;
5. if taxon B = taxon A
then return to 4;
else proceed to 6;
6. taxon a is moved to taxon B.
Move: Split
1. user is requested to input a taxon level t, with t
= 2, ..., T - 1;
2. a taxon a of level t is randomly chosen;
3. taxon a is split into two new taxa in the same
position.
Move: Merge
1. user is requested to input a taxon level t, with t
= 2, ..., T - 1;
2. a taxon a of level t is randomly chosen;

3. if taxon A of level t + 1 containing a contains
only a
then return to 2;
else proceed to 4;
4. a taxon b of level t is randomly chosen within
taxon A;
5. if a = b
then return to 4;
else proceed to 6;
6. taxa a and b are merged in a new taxon in the
same position.
In all moves, downstream relationships are maintained.
For example, if genus a containing species α and β is
moved from family A to family B, species α and β will still
belong to genus a within family B. The same holds true
for splits and merges.

In this phase, the basic phylogenetic representativeness
analysis is applied on each master list. Therefore, a large
number (depending upon the chosen number of master
lists to be simulated) of analyses are performed and consequently six sets of measurements are obtained for each
dimension s, namely the six parameters describing AvTD
and VarTD:
lower AvTD 95% confidence limit;
mean AvTD;
mean VarTD;
upper VarTD 95% confidence limit;
maximum AvTD;
minimum VarTD;
For the first four sets of measurements, upper and
lower 95% confidence limits are computed for each
dimension s across all master lists, thus giving an idea of
the stability of results. For the fifth and sixth sets of measurement, simply the maximum entry is kept for each
dimension s as above.
