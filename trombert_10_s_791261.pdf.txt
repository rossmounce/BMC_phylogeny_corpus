S. Typhimurium sseJ gene decreases the S. Typhi
cytotoxicity toward cultured epithelial cells
A Nicole Trombert, Liliana Berrocal, Juan A Fuentes, Guido C Mora*

Abstract
Background: Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and Typhimurium are closely related serovars as indicated by >96%
DNA sequence identity between shared genes. Nevertheless, S. Typhi is a strictly human-specific pathogen causing
a systemic disease, typhoid fever. In contrast, S. Typhimurium is a broad host range pathogen causing only a selflimited gastroenteritis in immunocompetent humans. We hypothesize that these differences have arisen because
some genes are unique to each serovar either gained by horizontal gene transfer or by the loss of gene activity
due to mutation, such as pseudogenes. S. Typhi has 5% of genes as pseudogenes, much more than S.
Typhimurium which contains 1%. As a consequence, S. Typhi lacks several protein effectors implicated in invasion,
proliferation and/or translocation by the type III secretion system that are fully functional proteins in S.
Typhimurium. SseJ, one of these effectors, corresponds to an acyltransferase/lipase that participates in SCV
biogenesis in human epithelial cell lines and is needed for full virulence of S. Typhimurium. In S. Typhi, sseJ is a
pseudogene. Therefore, we suggest that sseJ inactivation in S. Typhi has an important role in the development of
the systemic infection.
Results: We investigated whether the S. Typhi trans-complemented with the functional sseJ gene from S.
Typhimurium (STM) affects the cytotoxicity toward cultured cell lines. It was found that S. Typhi harbouring sseJSTM
presents a similar cytotoxicity level and intracellular retention/proliferation of cultured epithelial cells (HT-29 or HEp2) as wild type S. Typhimurium. These phenotypes are significantly different from wild type S. Typhi
Conclusions: Based on our results we conclude that the mutation that inactivate the sseJ gene in S. Typhi resulted
in evident changes in the behaviour of bacteria in contact with eukaryotic cells, plausibly contributing to the S.
Typhi adaptation to the systemic infection in humans.

Background
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) is a
human-restricted pathogen that causes enteric fever or
typhoid. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S.
Typhimurium) is considered a broad host range pathogen that causes gastroenteritis in several warm-blooded
animals such as calves and humans, but produces a
typhoid-like systemic infection in mice [1-3]. Although
the mechanism by which serovar Typhimurium causes
gastroenteritis is well studied, less is known about the
pathogenesis of the serovar Typhi. One limitation to the
study of typhoid fever is the absence of a good animal
model. For this reason, although the S. Typhimurium mouse model has been used to infer S. Typhi important

virulence mechanisms by the expression of S. Typhi
genes in S. Typhimurium, the information derived from
infection of mice is limited mainly because the virulence
factors are tested in an heterologous system. Furthermore, S. Typhimurium does not cause typhoid in
humans, suggesting that genetic differences between
both serovars are crucial for disease development.
The evolution of a broad host pathogen, such as S.
Typhimurium, to a host-restricted pathogen, such as S.
Typhi, might have occurred by (i) the acquisition of
genetic material through horizontal gene transfer, (ii)
genome degradation (i.e., the loss of genetic information
by deletion or pseudogene formation) or (iii) a combination of both of these mechanisms [4,5]. The acquisition
and persistence of DNA segments containing genes with
pathogenicity or virulence functions (i.e., pathogenicity
islands) will depend on the advantage they confer to the

pathogen infectious cycle. Thus, bacteria with a great
ability to colonise different environments, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, generally have larger genomes than
those that survive in restricted niches [6].
The phenomenon by which a microorganism becomes
adapted to its host involves the loss of genetic functions
resulting in pseudogene generation, a process termed
“reductive evolution”. This process has been observed in
human-adapted pathogens such as Shigella flexneri,
Mycobacterium leprae and Salmonella Typhi [7,8]. For
example, the loss of the ompT gene in Shigella confers a
virulent phenotype by allowing bacteria to transmigrate
across eukaryotic cells [9,10]. In the case of Salmonella,
some serovars have accumulated mutations that enhance
their survival within their respective hosts. For example
the poultry-adapted S. Pullorum and S. Gallinarum serovars are non-motile because they have a point mutation
in the flgK gene [11,12]. When S. Enteritidis and S.
Typhimurium are isolated from infected poultry, these
bacteria are frequently non-motile, suggesting that the
niche occupied in birds can select against flagellation
[13]. These non-motile S. Typhimurium strains have
been shown to be non-virulent when used to infect
mice. Thus, in the S. enterica, the adaptation to a particular vertebrate host seems to drive the loss of virulence
factors for some serovars. The result of this adaptation
may contribute to the narrowing of the host range and
to the development of host specificity [14].
S. Typhi is an intracellular facultative pathogen that
contains over 200 pseudogenes, nearly 5% of its whole
genome [15,16]. Several of the mutations that gave rise
to these pseudogenes occur in systems related to pathogenicity mechanisms. For example, the S. Typhimurium
sseJ gene encodes an effector protein regulated by Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2) [17,18]. SPI-2
regulated genes are related to bacterial intracellular trafficking and proliferation, and encode a protein complex
known as the type III secretion system (T3SS). The
T3SS mediates the injection of effector proteins from
bacteria into eukaryotic cells [19-21]. These effector
proteins modulate the S. Typhimurium endocytic pathway and allow the establishment of bacteria in a specialised vacuole termed the Salmonella-containing vacuole
(SCV) [22]. Late stages of SCV synthesis include the formation of tubular membrane extensions known as Salmonella-induced filaments (Sifs). Sifs are thought to
result from the fusion of late endocytic compartments
with the SCV and their formation requires at least five
SPI-2-dependent effectors: SifA, SseF, SseG, SopD2 and
SseJ [23-26]. In this context, S. Typhimurium sseJ
encodes an acyltransferase/lipase that participates in
SCV biogenesis in human epithelial cell lines [25,27-29].
The coordination of SseJ and SifA is required for bacterial intracellular proliferation [30]. Some studies have

Page 2 of 10

shown that SseJ is needed for full virulence of S. Typhimurium in mice and for proliferation within human culture cells [31].
S. Typhi lacks several effector proteins that are crucial
for the pathogenicity of the generalist serovar S. Typhimurium [29]. The absence of these proteins could contribute to the specificity of the human-restricted
serovars, and could play a role in evolutionary adaptation. In S. Typhi, sseJ is considered a pseudogene. In
this work, we studied the effect of trans-complementing
S. Typhi with the S. Typhimurium sseJ gene and
assessed the phenotype in human cell lines. Our results
show that the presence of the sseJ gene induces phenotypic changes in cytotoxicity and in intracellular proliferation of S. Typhi in human epithelial cell lines. Our
results suggest that the loss of SseJ function contributes
to the development of a systemic infection in S. Typhi.

Results
sseJ is a pseudogene in S. Typhi

To assess whether the sseJ locus is a pseudogene in the
serovar Typhi, we compared the available sequences of
S. Typhi Ty2, S. Typhi CT18 and S. Typhimurium LT2
[15,32,33]. We observed that the sequence corresponding to sseJ in S. Typhi is a 3’ partial remnant of 141 bp,
in contrast with the complete ORF found in S. Typhimurium (1227 bp). In order to corroborate these bioinformatics results, we designed a PCR assay with two sets
of primers. The primers SseJ1Tym + SseJ2Tym yield a
1460 bp amplicon only when sseJ is complete, while the
primers SseJRT1 + SseJRT2 yield a 127 bp amplicon if
the 3’ sseJ locus is present (Figure 1). As shown in
Table 1 we observed a PCR product with the SseJRT1 +
SseJRT2 primers in all the strains tested, including the
reference strains (S. Typhi CT18, S. Typhi Ty2 and S.
Typhimurium LT2) and S. Typhi clinical strains
obtained from Chilean patients (STH collection). Nevertheless, we observed a PCR amplicon with the SseJ1Tym
+ SseJ2Tym primers only when the S. Typhimurium
genomic DNA was used as template, strongly suggesting
that the sseJ gene is an incomplete gene (i.e., a pseudogene) not only in the S. Typhi Ty2 and CT18 strains,
but in all the Typhi clinical strains tested. To independently assess this hypothesis, we performed a Southern
blot using the 1460 bp amplicon as a specific probe
(Figure 2). The annealing of the probe with the EcoRV
digested genome of S. Typhimurium yielded a 3450 bp
fragment, while in S. Typhi, we observed a 1800 bp fragment. As shown in Figure 2 our data indicated that the
presence of the pseudogene in S. Typhi CT18
is conserved in the S. Typhi clinical collection (STH).
Therefore, the sseJ pseudogene seems to be a
feature in serovar Typhi that distinguishes it from the
serovar Typhimurium. S. Typhi STH007 presents no

designed (small arrows), the recognition sites of EcoRV and the sseJ probe hibridisation site (thick black line labelled 3450 bp for S. Typhimurium
and 1800 bp for S. Typhi). The data were obtained from S. Typhi CT18 and S. Typhimurium LT2 genomes, available in public databases www.

hibridisation with the probe, showing that this strain
presents a larger deletion in the sseJ locus compared
with other strains tested. S. Typhi STH2370 showed a
slightly larger fragment than the other S. Typhi clinical
strains presumably because of point mutations that
changed the EcoRV restriction sites. Therefore, serovar
Typhi has a genetic mutation in sseJ gene correlating
with the previous studies made in strain CT18. We reasoned that the sseJ gene in the serovar Typhi is
inactivated.
S. Typhi harbouring the S. Typhimurium sseJ gene
exhibits a decreased disruption of HT-29 polarised
monolayers

If the loss of SseJ function in S. Typhi is advantageous
for the interaction of bacteria with host cells, we should

observe that wild type S. Typhi will present a different
behaviour than the S. Typhi harbouring the S. Typhimurium sseJ gene when they are in contact with eukaryotic cells. This hypothesis was first tested by infecting
polarised HT-29 monolayers with the strains under
study using a modified transepithelial migration assay
that included addition of gentamicin (after 1 h of infection, see Materials and Methods) into the upper chamber (black arrow, Figure 3). As shown in Figure 3 the
recovered CFU × ml-1 represented the bacteria which
migrated to the lower chamber and survived the presence of the gentamicin that passed through the cell
monolayer. If the integrity of the monolayer is disrupted
by bacteria, gentamicin will leak through the lower
chamber decreasing the recovered CFU × ml-1 . If the
monolayer is not disrupted, the recovered CFU × ml-1

should remain essentially constant over the same time
course. As observed in Figure 3 the recovered CFU ×
ml -1 corresponding to S. Typhimurium 14028s presented a slight decline over the time course of the assay
(white diamonds), suggesting that the monolayer integrity is not largely affected by bacteria. In contrast, the
CFU × ml -1 of S. Typhi STH2370 recovered from the
lower chamber abruptly decreased until they became
undetectable, strongly suggesting that the gentamicin
leaked into the lower chamber due to a monolayer disruption (black squares). When S. Typhi were complemented with the S. Typhimurium sseJ gene (sseJSTM) (in
the pNT005 plasmid, see Materials and Methods), and
used to infect the monolayer, we observed that the corresponding recovered CFU × ml-1 remained essentially

constant, marking a sharp difference with the otherwise

Typhimurium phenotype (compare the white diamonds
and black triangles).
In order to independently assess whether S. Typhi
harbouring the S. Typhimurium sseJ gene shows a
decreased disruptive effect toward cultured cell monolayers than the wild type S. Typhi, we measured the
transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). TER is a measure of the movement of ions across the paracellular
pathway. Measurement of TER across cells grown on
permeable membranes can provide an indirect assessment of tight junction establishment, stability and
monolayer integrity [34]. As shown in Figure 4 after 1 h
of infection wild type S. Typhi efficiently disrupted the
monolayer as inferred by the lower TER measured compared with the control without bacteria. However, when
HT-29 cells were infected with S. Typhi/pNT005, TER
values were similar to those obtained with S. Typhimurium 14028s. This result indicates that S. Typhi/pNT005
was less disruptive on the monolayer than S. Typhi wild
type, supporting the result shown in Figure 3. To discard a possible gene dosage effect by the vector copy
number, we infected cells with S. Typhi/pNT006 (complemented with a single-copy vector harbouring sseJSTM)
and the TER obtained was similar to that of S. Typhi/
pNT005. This result demonstrated that the effect on cell
permeability was due to the presence of sseJSTM and not
to an artifact produced by gene dosage.

Figure 4 The presence of the sseJ gene in S. Typhi promotes
the disruption of the epithelial monolayer. HT-29 cells were
grown in transwells for 12-15 days. Polarised HT-29 cells were
apically infected with the wild type S. Typhi or the respective
complemented strains. TER 1 h post-infection reported as a
percentage of the initial TER value and is expressed as the means ±
SD of three different experiments, each performed in duplicate. The
percentages of TER values from cells infected with S. Typhi carrying
each empty plasmid (pSU19 or pCC1) showed no differences with
respect the wild type strain (data not shown).

S. Typhi harbouring sseJSTM was less cytotoxic than wild
type S. Typhi

Kops et al. demonstrated that S. Typhi Ty2 causes rapid
death of some C2BBe cells in monolayers [35]. Because
cell monolayer permeability may be increased due to
cell death during infection, we wanted to assess whether
the presence of sseJ STM in S. Typhi contributes to
decrease cytotoxicity, as the results of the Figure 3 and
4 strongly suggest. Cell membrane damage due to cytotoxicity leads to the release of cytoplasmic enzymes, and
the measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
release is a well-accepted assay to estimate cell membrane integrity and quantify cell cytotoxicity [36,37].
Then, the LDH release induced by S. Typhimurium, S.
Typhi, S. Typhi/pNT005 or S. Typhi/pNT006 was compared. As shown in Figure 5 we found that wild type S.
Typhi STH2370 was the most cytotoxic strain among all
bacteria tested. This result suggests that the SseJ effector
protein decreased S. Typhi cytoxicity when bacteria
interact with human cell lines, resulting in increased cell
permeability.
The presence of sseJSTM in S. Typhi increased bacterial
intracellular retention/proliferation within HEp-2 cells

It has been reported that sseJ contributes to the intracellular proliferation of S. Typhimurium [31,38]. Moreover,
the decreased cell death produced by the presence of
sseJ STM in S. Typhi strains (Figure 5) may lead to an
increased proliferation of intracellular bacteria because

type. The values correspond to the means ± SD of three
independent experiments, each performed in duplicate. The

of a decreased cytotoxicity. A less cytotoxic pathogen
should be retained inside eukaryotic cells over time,
allowing an increased bacterial proliferation. If this
hypothesis is correct, S. Typhi carrying sseJSTM should
exhibit increased CFUs in the gentamicin protection
assay (see Materials and Methods). As expected, Figure
6 shows that the presence of sseJSTM yielded a significantly increase in the CFUs recovered from the infected
cells compared to the wild type.

Discussion
In the process of adaptation to humans, genes no longer
compatible with the lifestyle of S. Typhi within the host
were selectively inactivated. These inactivated genes are
called “antivirulence genes” and their loss of function
results in the adaptation to a given host [39]. S. Typhi is
a facultative bacterial pathogen that has accumulated a
high number of pseudogenes (approximately 5% of the
genome) and over 75% of them have completely lost
their functions [7,16]. When compared with the genome
of free-living organisms, facultative pathogens harbour
several pseudogenes and a population structure that
promotes the maintenance of the mutations. In this
context, S. Typhi represents an intermediate step
between obligate bacterial parasites and free living bacteria, exhibiting some genome erosion directed to

Trombert et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:312
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/312

inactivate and lose detrimental or non-essential functions for their environment (i.e. host) [40]. Thus, we
hypothesized that the loss of some of these genes contributed to the adaptation of S. Typhi to the systemic
infection.
Our results suggest that the loss of the fully functional
SseJ protein in S. Typhi contributed to the adaptation to
the systemic infection by increasing bacterial cytotoxicity in epithelial cells. The increased cytotoxicity presented by S. Typhi compared with S. Typhimurium is
not only related to the loss of functions, as we showed
here with the sseJ pseudogene; but also to the acquisition of new functions. It has been reported that S. Typhi
presents a pathogenicity island (named SPI-18) that harbours hlyE. The hlyE gene encodes a cytolysin that has
proved to be cytotoxic toward different cell types
[41-43]. SPI-18 is shared by other Salmonella enterica
serovars that have been shown to cause systemic infections in humans, but is absent from S. Typhimurium
[41]. In addition, the functional transfer of the S. Typhi
hlyE gene to S. Typhimurium promotes deep organ
infection in mice [41]. All this evidence suggests that S.
Typhi has been selected for an increased cytotoxicity
inside its host in order to perform a successful systemic
infection. Thus, an increased cytotoxicity toward the
epithelial barrier may guarantee the development of a
deeper infection and a decreased retention inside epithelial cells at the bacterial entry point.
On the other hand, the presence of the sseJSTM gene
in S. Typhi significantly enhances the retention
time within epithelial cells and/or the intracellular proliferation as we showed in Figure 6 in agreement with
previous reports that indicate that SseJ enzymatic
activity
contributes to intracellular replication in host tissues
[31,38]. Accordingly, it is possible that the sseJ loss of
function was selected in S. Typhi in order to promote a
decreased retention/proliferation of bacteria inside the
eukaryotic cells. It is known that the intracellular proliferation is essential for the virulence of S. Typhimurium
[44]. Nevertheless, recent studies revealed that the magnitude of the CD8+ T cell response correlates directly to
the intracellular proliferation in Salmonella enterica,
showing that a reduced intracellular proliferation limits
antigen presentation and development of a rapid CD8+
T cell response, indicating that reduced intracellular
proliferation of virulent pathogens may be an important
mechanism of immune evasion. [45]. Accordingly, Salmonella presents several responses directed to downregulate the intracellular proliferation, reinforcing the
concept that a state of low proliferation within the host
cell is strategy to enhance virulence in a determined
niche [46]. Actually, it has been shown that Salmonella

with the S. Typhimurium 14028s, S. Typhi STH2370 or the respective

h post-infection. The values correspond to the means ± SD of three
different experiments, each performed in triplicate. The CFUs

expands its population in the liver by increasing the
number of infection foci rather than undergoing massive
intracellular growth in individual host cells, where the
bacterial spreading from the initial infection foci to
nearby cells may be facilitated by inducing cytotoxic
effects in the infected cells [47,48].
How sseJSTM reduces the cytotoxicity in S. Typhi is
not clear. It is known that the lipid imbalance associated to the presence of lipid alcohols, fatty acid and
sterols is related to cytotoxicity and apoptosis [49,50].
Any process that limits the accumulation of these species is likely to be cytoprotective [50]. One such process involves the presence of different acyltransferase
gene families that generate neutral lipids or steryl
esters from these lipid alcohols [50]. SseJ, that presents
glycerophospholipid: cholesterol acyltransferase
(GCAT) activity in eukaryotic cells [51], might plausibly contribute to the reduction of the lipid-associated
cytoxicity. The precise mechanisms underlying this
process is unknown, but one possibility is that the presence of sseJSTM in S. Typhi is affecting the lipid remodelling in the infected cells, in turn reducing the
cytotoxicity.
All our results together suggest that the loss of the
sseJ gene in S. Typhi contributed to the adaptation to
the systemic infection by increasing the bacterialinduced cytotoxicity and by decreasing the retention/
proliferation inside the epithelial cells.

Conclusions
Based on our results we conclude that the mutation that
inactivate the sseJ gene in S. Typhi resulted in evident
changes in the behaviour of bacteria in contact with
eukaryotic cells, plausibly contributing to the S. Typhi
adaptation to the systemic infection in humans.
Methods
Bacterial strains, media and growth conditions

The S. Typhi and S. Typhimurium strains used in this
study are described in Table 2. Strains were routinely
grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (Bacto Tryptone
10 g × l-1; Bacto Yeast Extract 5 g × l-1, NaCl 5 g × l-1)
at 37°C, with vigorous shaking, or anaerobically by adding an overlay of 500 μl of sterile mineral oil as a barrier
to oxygen prior to invasion assays with cultured human
cells. When required, the medium was supplemented
with antibiotics at the following concentrations: chloramphenicol 20 μg × ml-1, ampicillin 100 μg × ml-1 and
kanamycin 50 μg × ml-1. Media were solidified by the
addition of agar (15 g × l-1 Bacto agar).
Construction of plasmids

The sseJ PCR product was initially cloned into pGEM-T
Easy (Promega) to yield plasmid pNT002, and the presence of the gene was confirmed by PCR amplification
and restriction endonuclease assays. The DNA fragment
containing the sseJ gene was obtained from pNT002 and
cloned into the EcoRI site of the medium-copy number

vector pSU19 [52] to yield the plasmid pNT005. The
presence of the gene and its promoter region was confirmed in all plasmids by PCR amplification and restriction endonuclease analyses. The PCR product was
directly cloned in the pCC1 vector according to manufacturer’s instructions (CopyControl™ PCR Cloning Kit,
Stratagene) to yield the plasmid pNT006. The expression of sseJ gene from each plasmid was confirmed by
Western blotting (data not shown).
Bioinformatic analyses

Comparative sequence analyses were made with the
complete genome sequences of S. enterica serovar Typhi
strains CT18 (GenBank: AL627270.1) and Ty2 (GenBank: AL513382), serovar Typhimurium LT2 (GenBank:
AE006468.1). The sequences were analyzed using the
BLAST, alignment, and phylogeny tools available at
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and by visual inspection to
improve alignments.
PCR amplification

PCR amplifications were performed using an Eppendorf
thermal cycler and Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen
Cat. N° 11615-010). Reaction mixtures contained 1 ×
PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, each dNTP (200 mM), primers (1 mM), 100 ng of template DNA, and 2 U polymerase. Standard conditions for amplification were 30
cycles at 94°C for 30 seconds, 62°C for 1 min and 72°C
for 2 min 30 seconds, followed by a final extension step

at 72°C for 10 min. Template S. Typhi chromosomal
DNA was prepared as described [53]. Primers SseJ1Tym
(CATTGTATGTATTTTATTGGCGACG) and SseJ2Tym (AATCGGCAGCAAAGATAGCA) were used to
amplify 1460 bp, and were designed from the S. Typhimurium LT2 sseJ reported sequence. The conditions for
amplification of 127 bp were 30 cycles at 94°C for 30
seconds, 53°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 1 min, followed by a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min. Primers SseJRT1 (GCTAAAGACCCTCAGCTAGA) and
SseJRT2 (CAGTGGAATAATGATGAGCT) were
designed from the S. Typhimurium LT2 sseJ reported
sequence.

ments). The enterocytes were grown to confluence (1821 days) on 3.0 μm pore-size filters (“transwells”, Millicell®, Millipore). The electrical resistance readings were
recorded after subtracting the average resistance of two
membranes in the absence of enterocytes at the beginning of the assay (t0) and 1 h post-infection (t1). Controls included the incubation of the cells with EDTA
and Triton X-100 (1% PBS). The reading was expressed
as percentages and calculated as follows:

(

%TER ( 1h ) = 100 × TER t 0 × TER t 1 −1

)

We verified the HT-29 polarisation by TER and transmission electron microscopy.

Southern hybridisations

Hybridisation probes for sseJ were generated by PCR
amplification and were purified and labelled using the
Detector™ Random Primer DNA Biotinylation Kit (KPL).
Genomic DNA from Salmonella serovars was prepared
as described by Maloy [54], cleaved with EcoRV (Invitrogen) and the fragments were resolved on a 0.8% agarose
gel. The DNA was then transferred to a nylon membrane
and cross-linked by UV irradiation. Hybridisation was
performed according to the protocol described in the
chemiluminescent system, using a DNA Detector™ HRP
Southern Blotting Kit (KPL) and Kodak XAR-5 film.
Cell permeability assay

We used an in vitro assay modified from the method
described by McCormick [55]. Briefly, the colon carcinoma HT-29 cell line was grown to confluence (18-21
days) on 3.0 μm pore-size filters (“transwells”, Millicell®,
Millipore) with glucose-free RPMI (Gibco). Each transwell was inoculated individually to the apical surface
with 400 μl of approximately 1 × 107 CFU ml-1 of bacterial cultures and immediately incubated for 60 min at
37°C. After extensive washing with sterile PBS (NaCl
0.8% w/v; KCl 0.02% w/v; Na2HPO4 2H2O 0.13% w/v;
KH 2 PO 4 0.02% w/v), the extracellular bacteria were
killed by treatment of monolayers with gentamicin (50
μg × ml-1). Immediately after gentamicin treatment, the
medium from basal compartment of the epithelial cell
monolayer was collected and plated for colony forming
units (CFU) to assess the number of bacteria that passed
through the cell monolayer. The polarisation of cells was
confirmed by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER)
and transmission electron microscopy (data not shown).
Transepithelial electrical resistance

TER was used to monitor changes in epithelial cell culture integrity. TER in HT-29 enterocytes was studied
using an EVOM electrode (World Precision Instru-

LDH Cytotoxicity Assay

Cytotoxicity of infected HT-29 cells was assayed using a
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) Kit (Valtek), which measures
the extracellular release of LDH into the media by dead
cells, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
absorbance values of treated cells were expressed as a percentage relative to the wild type S. Typhi after correcting
for background from media without cells at 340 nm.
Gentamicin protection Assay

To measure bacterial invasion, the method described by
Lissner [56] and modified by Contreras [57] was used.
Briefly, HEp-2 monolayers (5 × 10 5 cells/well) were
grown at 37°C in a 5% CO2/95% air mixture in RPMIFS
(RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum pre-treated for 30 min at 60°C). The tested bacterial strains were grown anaerobically to mid-exponential phase and then harvested by centrifugation prior to
infect the monolayers in 96-well microtiter plates at a
multiplicity of infection of 100:1. After incubation of 1 h
to allow bacterial entry into the cells, monolayers were
washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and
100 μL of RPMI containing gentamicin (200 μg × ml-1)
was added to each well. The plates were then incubated
for 2 h to kill any remaining extracellular bacteria. In
the case of the strains carrying vectors, the medium was
supplemented additionally with chloramphenicol during
the entire assay. The medium was removed and cells
were washed twice with PBS. Then, the cells were lysed
with sodium deoxycholate (0.5% w/v, in PBS). The number of intracellular bacteria (CFU at t3) was determined
plating onto LB agar plates with chloramphenicol (the
strains carrying plasmid) or without antibiotic (the wild
type strains). Quantitative invasion assay values were
calculated as follows:

(

3 h post infection index = 100 × intracellular CFU mL−1at t 3 × CFU mL−1added

)
