Abstract
Background: The Wuschel related homeobox (WOX) family proteins are key regulators implicated in
the determination of cell fate in plants by preventing cell differentiation. A recent WOX phylogeny, based
on WOX homeodomains, showed that all of the Physcomitrella patens and Selaginella moellendorffii WOX
proteins clustered into a single orthologous group. We hypothesized that members of this group might
preferentially share a significant part of their function in phylogenetically distant organisms. Hence, we first
validated the limits of the WOX13 orthologous group (WOX13 OG) using the occurrence of other clade
specific signatures and conserved intron insertion sites. Secondly, a functional analysis using expression
data and mutants was undertaken.
Results: The WOX13 OG contained the most conserved plant WOX proteins including the only WOX
detected in the highly proliferating basal unicellular and photosynthetic organism Ostreococcus tauri. A large
expansion of the WOX family was observed after the separation of mosses from other land plants and
before monocots and dicots have arisen. In Arabidopsis thaliana, AtWOX13 was dynamically expressed
during primary and lateral root initiation and development, in gynoecium and during embryo development.
AtWOX13 appeared to affect the floral transition. An intriguing clade, represented by the functional
AtWOX14 gene inside the WOX13 OG, was only found in the Brassicaceae. Compared to AtWOX13, the
gene expression profile of AtWOX14 was restricted to the early stages of lateral root formation and
specific to developing anthers. A mutational insertion upstream of the AtWOX14 homeodomain sequence
led to abnormal root development, a delay in the floral transition and premature anther differentiation.
Conclusion: Our data provide evidence in favor of the WOX13 OG as the clade containing the most
conserved WOX genes and established a functional link to organ initiation and development in
Arabidopsis, most likely by preventing premature differentiation. The future use of Ostreococcus tauri and
Physcomitrella patens as biological models should allow us to obtain a better insight into the functional
importance of WOX13 OG genes.

Background
Homeodomain (HD) containing transcription factors are
key regulators implicated in the determination of cell fate
and cell differentiation in both plants and animals. In
Angiosperms, a gene called WUSCHEL (WUS) has been
isolated from many different species. WUS was the first
identified member of the Wuschel-related homeobox
(WOX) subfamily [1,2] that is only found in plants.
The specific expression of the WOX genes in different
plant organs and cell types [2-7] suggested an important
role for them during organogenesis. The WUS gene is
expressed in a restricted region of the meristem called the
organizing centre located below the stem cells of the shoot
apical meristem (SAM) and functions non-cell autonomously to control the stem cell fate [8]. Interestingly Gallois et al [3] showed recently that ectopic expression of
WUS in the root establishes shoot stem cells and leaf
development. Other members of the WOX family might
also prevent premature cell differentiation in developing
organs or tissues. Recently, WOX5 was shown to be
involved in stem cell maintenance signaling in the root
[9]. Wu et al [10] have shown that WOX9 (Stimpy/STIP)
prevents premature cell differentiation during organ
growth, in addition to contributing positively to WUS
expression. This work also revealed that stip mutants can
be rescued by sucrose, a modulator of cell proliferation
trough cyclin D induction [11,12]. Two other WOX genes,
named Narrow Sheath 1 and 2, that are maize orthologues of Arabidopsis thaliana AtWOX6 were shown to be
involved in the recruitment of the lateral founder cells
within the SAM prior to the primordia development [13].
Last, Haecker et al [1] analyzed the expression dynamics
of the WOX genes during A. thaliana embryo development
and showed that members of the WOX family mark cell
fate decisions during embryonic patterning. Taken
together, these results suggest that not only WUS but several other WOX genes play a role in regulating cell division and preventing cell differentiation.
Characterized genomes of Angiosperms contain more
than 10 different WOXs and phylogenetic studies suggest
that the WOX family existed in the last common ancestor
of monocots and core eudicots [14,15]. A recent WOX
phylogeny based on WOX HDs from different
Angiosperms, the moss Physcomitrella patens and the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii showed that all of the P.
patens and eight of the S. moellendorffii WOX genes clustered in the same clade [16]. Indeed, the phylogenetic
analyses of a transcription factor family like WOX suffer
from some limitations due to the relatively short length of
the HD, which is the only conserved sequence between
the WOX protein family members, and the relatively few
land plant species with a completely characterized proteome. As a consequence, the patterns of phylogenic trees

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/291

of large families of plant transcription factors are often
weakly supported by statistics and may be affected by long
branch attraction [17]. Nevertheless, clade specific gene
features and protein domains were observed in transcription factors [18,19]. Thus, in this study, we used clade specific signatures beyond the HD and clade specific
conservation of intron insertion sites, to provide additional data in support of the orthology links predicted by
the WOX phylogeny. In order to carry out the latter analyses, complete genome sequences with accurate structural
annotations are essential. Our results strongly support the
existence of a WOX13 orthologous group (WOX13 OG)
that, contrary to the two other WOX OGs, contains genes
from many different members of the plant kingdom,
including basal species, and a branch apparently specific
to Brassicaceae. To obtain information on the function of
the genes belonging to the WOX13 clade, the cell specificity of At WOX13 and At WOX14 expression was established experimentally and phenotypes resulting from
mutations within these two genes were characterized in
the plant model A. thaliana.

Results
A WOX distance tree from model genomes
We carefully screened several completely sequenced
eukaryote genomes for WOX genes, i.e., two Angiosperms,
A. thaliana and O. sativa, three algae, O. tauri, O. lucimarinus and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and two yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. No WOX
genes were identified outside of the plant kingdom and
Ostreococcus revealed only one WOX gene per genome.
Moreover, using the HMMsearch tool [20], we found only
one HD gene in C. reinhardtii, 2 in S. pombe, 4 in O. tauri
and 8 in S. cerevisiae compared to the 92 HD genes in A.
thaliana.

Distance and phylogenic trees were computed from the
HD sequences of the WOX proteins from the five plant
model genomes, O. tauri, P. patens, S. moellendorffii, A.
thaliana and O. sativa (see method section). The clustering
of the WOX proteins in 3 different OGs were consistent
using either the Neighbor-Joining (Figure 1) or the Maximum likelihood (see additional file 1: Figure 1) methods
and different outgroups. The topology of the trees clearly
showed three different OGs namely the WOX1, WOX8
and WOX13 MOGs (for Model plant OG). Each OG contained rice and Arabidopsis proteins, but the single WOX
protein of O. tauri, the three P. patens and the three S. Moellendorffii WOX proteins were all found in the same group,
the WOX13 MOG. The WOX1 MOG contained AtWOX17 and AtWUS, the WOX8 OG associated AtWOX8, 9, 11
and 12 and the WOX13 OG included AtWOX10, 13 and
14. Thus, the previous observation of the presence of the
P. patens proteins only in the WOX13 OG group was
extended to O. tauri and S. moellendorffii. However, the

WOX genes from model plant genomes
WOX genes from model plant genomes. The neighbor-joining tree of the WOX proteins from the 5 completely
sequenced genomes of the green lineage: Arabidopsis thaliana (AT prefix), Oryza sativa (OS prefix), Physcomitrella patens (Ppa
prefix), Ostreococcus tauri (OT prefix) and Selaginella moellendorffii (Sm prefix). The tree topology was inferred from Jones-Taylor-Thornton matrix distances. The significance of each node was tested using 1000 bootstrap replicates. Only bootstrap values above 50% are shown. The scale, at the top left of the tree, indicates 0.1 substitutions per site. Different structural features
are represented by different signs and colors as described at the bottom of the figure.

introduction of OtWOX and the SmWOXs did not change
the main branching of the trees nor significantly modified
the bootstrap values at the internal node of the tree. The
14 available WOX sequences from different Gymnosperms were distributed between the three OGs (data not
shown). Furthermore, the trees we obtained were not consistent with the phylogenetic tree of plant species as it is
now known [21]. Thus the WOX trees we produced suggest probably several rounds of gene deletions in O. tauri
and P. patens in order to explain the branching of the
WOX13 OG. The finding that all the WOX sequences of O.
tauri and P. patens, as well as those of S. moellendorffii were
clustered in the WOX13 OG suggested to us that
AtWOX10, 13, 14 might represent the most interesting
genes to study the functional diversification of the WOX
genes although they are the WOX genes for which we have
the least functional information (reviewed in [22]). This
prompted us to look at the specificity of the WOX13 OG
with regards to gene structure and conserved amino acid
signatures other than the HD. Conservation in gene structure is an indication of a common ancestor while conserved amino acid signatures are linked to functions such
as protein-protein interactions or regulatory sites.
WOX gene structures
The intron-exon organization of WOX genes from the
model genomes showed different gene structures (see
additional file 2: Figure 1). Alignments supporting the
conservation of intron insertion sites are given in additional file 2: Figure 2. The organization of the gene structures along the phylogeny tree did not reveal any
contradiction between gene structures and tree pattern.
Intron site conservations were exclusively observed within
each of the three OGs and never between them. In this
context, it was interesting to observe that the insertion site
of the first intron in AtWOX13 is conserved in almost all
the genes (from moss to Angiosperms) belonging to the
WOX13 OG. The only exception was PpaWOX03, a possible pseudogene (see below). This observation cannot be
extended to O. tauri as its genes do not have introns. S.
moellendorffii genes have introns and the three full-length
SmWOXs have one conserved intron insertion site downstream from the WOX13 motif. The latter intron of
SmWOXs is in a similar position (relative to the coding
region) to the first highly conserved intron of WOX13 OG
genes in moss and Angiosperms. Nevertheless, there is no
trace of amino acid sequence conservation in the corresponding protein region between S. moellendorffii and the
other genes in the WOX13 OG (see additional file 3: Table
3). When taken together, our analyses of intron insertion
sites support the boundaries of the WOX13 OG as defined
by phylogeny. In addition to the highly conserved intron
upstream of the HD coding sequence found in the
WOX13 OG, AtWOX10 and AtWOX14 share another conserved intron insertion site downstream of the HD while

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/291

OS01G60270 and AtWOX13 share a different intron insertion site in the 3' region of the gene. The tree pattern
implies first a loss of the orthologues of AtWOX10 and 14
in O. sativa and in P. patens and secondly that AtWOX13
and OS01G60270 are orthologous. Interestingly, the two
latter genes share a specific intron insertion site.
Specific motifs in the WOX proteins
A search for specific motifs other than the HD used to
build the distance and phylogeny trees led us to identify
HMMs that were specific to each clade and located either
within the N or the C terminal regions of the different proteins. These HMMs are illustrated by sequence logos (see
additional file 2: Figure 3) and by alignments (see additional file 2: Figure 4). Only proteins of the WOX1 clade
have a small motif of 10 amino acids (i.e., the TLxLFP
motif) in the C-terminal region, but at relatively variable
distances from the HD. TLxLFP has previously been
described as a characteristic motif of WUS proteins [1,23],
but we show here that it is common to the entire WOX1
clade, i.e., it is observed not only in WUS, but also in the
AtWOX1-7 proteins. However, the WUS proteins of A.
thaliana
(AT2G17950-AtWUS)
and
O.
sativa
(OS04G56780) share specific features not observed in any
of the other proteins of the WOX1 MOG. Indeed, they display 1) the LELxL WUS motif [1] known as EAR-like or
ERF-like motifs that are located in the outmost C-terminal
region, similar to a motif found in potent transcriptional
repressors in plants i.e., Superman [24] and Aux/IAA [25];
2) the same intron exon structure in the coding regions of
each gene; and 3) an additional amino acid at a conserved
position in the homeodomain.

Nearly all proteins of the WOX8 MOG contain two contiguous motifs of 30 amino acids situated near to their Cterminus (i.e., VFIN-WOX8 and LQxG-WOX8 MOG
motifs). The latter motifs are surrounded by two conserved introns. Remarkably, these introns are also found
in OS05G48990 in which the VFIN-WOX8 MOG motif is
replaced by a non-conserved sequence of a similar length.
All the proteins of the WOX13 MOG, except for
PpaWOX03, share a 39 amino acid motif that is found
upstream from the HD and named the WOX13 MOG
motif. This observation provides further support for the
validity of the WOX13 OG as defined by phylogeny and
to the hypothesis of a specific function of the genes clustered within. For all of these reasons, it was decided to
investigate further the WOX13 clade.
WOX13 OG distance tree
Thirty three full length WOX proteins were used to reconstruct the distance tree of the WOX13 clade (Figure 2),
using OtWOX as the outgroup. The neighbor-joining tree
showed two main branches. The first branch contained all

Page 4 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:291

of the Gymnosperm and the moss WOXs. The second
branch contained AtWOX13 together with many
Angiosperm sequences. This branch was further separated
into two branches, one contained AtWOX13 and many
proteins from different Angiosperms while the second
contained AtWOX10, AtWOX14 and a Brassica rapa
sequence.
The preferential presence of amino acid motifs fully supported the separation of the different gene groups within
the trees. Obviously, all proteins of the WOX13 clade displayed the WOX HD and the WOX13 motif. Moreover, we
also identified specific motifs for the AtWOX10, 14 and
for the AtWOX13 branches (see additional file 2: Figure
3). All Angiosperm proteins located inside the WOX13
OG shared two motifs, the YxDpl-WOX13 motif located
between the WOX13 MOG motif and the HD, and the
ESExE-WOX13 motif just downstream from the HD. The
monocots of the AtWOX13 branch also share a specific
motif called the monocot-WOX13 motif that was detected
also in two other partial proteins of two monocotyledon
species.
Proteins of the AtWOX10, 14 branch shared two specific
motifs, the YFdPM-WOX10 and QAdDaAVTT-WOX10
motifs. They were located to the same region of the protein as the YxDpl-WOX13 and ESExE-WOX13 motifs,
respectively. Hence, the similarity between the YFdPMWOX10 OG and YxDpl-WOX13 motifs suggested a common origin. Partial protein sequences from Brassica oleracea and Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. raphanistrum
(protein sequence derived from the two ESTs,
gb|EX762111| and gb|EX766460|) confirmed the specificity of the motifs to Brassicaceae. Thus, the AtWOX14 containing branch appears to be Brassicaceae specific since: 1)
all the sequences containing the two AtWOX10, 14 motifs
are from Brassicaceae and 2) no species other than those
belonging to the Brassicaceae displayed any of these two
motifs.
The Gymnosperm and moss branch contained proteins
that shared the ESExE-WOX13 OG motif with the
Angiosperm WOX13 proteins, located at the same position relative to the HD. They also shared two other motifs
specific to this branch: 1) the LxxGQ-gymnosperm/mossWOX OG motif that was at the same position as the
YxDpl-WOX13 OG or YFdPM-WOX10 OG motifs and 2)
a supplementary motif in the C-terminal region of the
proteins.
Functional WOX13 OG genes in the three model plants
We investigated the expression profiles of the WOX13 OG
genes within 3 plant model species namely O. tauri, P. patens and A. thaliana because of their position within the
green lineage. O. tauri is a highly proliferating unicellular

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/291

alga that has no known differentiated form. In addition to
the WOX gene, we also identified a single copy of a
KNOX-like gene (Ot04g04460) within the O. tauri
genome. In Angiosperms, members of the class-1 KNOX
subfamily act to prevent cell differentiation within the
SAM [26]. Interestingly, the OtKNOX protein showed the
characteristics of both the class-1 and class-2 KNOX conserved domains, suggesting that O. tauri had diverged
from a common ancestor before the diversification of the
KNOX gene into 2 classes.
In order to monitor the expression of WOX and KNOX
genes during the progression of the cell cycle, we partially
light-synchronized a cell suspension of O. tauri as
described before in [27]. RT-PCR and quantitative PCR
analyses of Cyclin B and Histone 4 genes showed a peak of
expression at 14 h, confirming the overlapping of the G2/
M and S subpopulations (Figure 3A and see additional file
4: Figure 1). The OtRH4 (Ot07g03220), and OtRH21
(Ot10g01950) genes, respectively the orthologues of the
Arabidopsis DEAD-box RNA-Helicase 4 and 21 [28] were
used as controls of constitutively expressed genes. They
did not show any significant variation, and they were not
cell cycle regulated (Figure 3A). More importantly, the
WOX and the KNOX genes were found to be constitutively
expressed and not cell cycle regulated (Figure 3A), with a
higher expression level for WOX compared to KNOX (see
additional file 4: Figure 1).
In P. patens, the initial gametophytic phase consists of an
array of filamentous tubes that are formed after cell initials are produced from the main filament. Further development proceeds by the formation of buds which form
the initial meristem from which originates the leafy adult
gametophyte [29]. These processes rely on a tight control
of cellular differentiation throughout the gametophyte
development. An analysis of WOX expression in P. patens
was carried out on 4-, 10- and 14-day-old plants corresponding respectively to the protonema, the bud and the
gametophore stages under our growth conditions (data
not shown). RT-PCR analyses showed that PpaWOX01
and PpaWOX02 were expressed throughout gametophyte
development whereas PpaWOX03 transcripts were not
detected (Figure 3B), thus supporting the hypothesis that
PpaWOX3 could be a pseudogene.
An exhaustive data mining analysis of A. thaliana expression databases [30-33] indicated that, both AtWOX13 and
AtWOX14 transcripts are present at different developmental stages i. e., embryo development, plantlet stage, root
formation, bolting stage, in flowers and in response to
stress (see discussion). However, no AtWOX10 transcripts
were present in any of the databases analyzed. In addition,
RT-PCR analyses of seedlings, even with a high PCR cycle
number, did not allow us to detect the AtWOX10 mRNA

(Figure 3C). These results suggested that the recently
duplicated AtWOX10 gene, found only in the A. thaliana
genome, might be a pseudogene. Based on these observations, this gene was not further characterized. We conclude that in the three plant model genomes studied at
least one copy of the WOX13OG genes is expressed during
development.
AtWOX13 shows a dynamic expression profile during A.
thaliana development
Compared to other WOX proteins, the function of the
AtWOX13 and 14 proteins have received little attention to
date (see review [22]). In order to carry out a more
detailed analysis of the WOX13 OG genes in A. thaliana,
we cloned the gene coding for the GUS reporter under the
control of the AtWOX13 and AtWOX14 upstream regulatory sequences. Based on our data mining analyses (see
above), we first analyzed the GUS expression during root
development. AtWOX13 promoter activity was detected
during lateral root formation (Figure 4A, C, F and 4I). To
validate the specificity of these data, in situ hybridization
experiments were performed using respectively AtWOX13
(Figure 4B, D, G and 4K), GUS (Figure 4J) and CUC2 as
probes (Figure 4E and 4H). The signal obtained using the
AtWOX13 and GUS probes matched perfectly with the
above GUS staining, whereas the CUC2 probe, as
expected, did not give any specific signal. Hence, the GUS
staining obtained reflects stable tissue specific mRNA
expression and revealed that the AtWOX13 promoter
sequence, used to drive the reporter gene GUS expression
was sufficient to mimic the tissue specific localization of
the endogenous AtWOX13 mRNA.

AtWOX13 expression was detected at the early stage of the
lateral root (LR) formation of 10-days-old seedlings and it
persisted during LR emergence (Figure 4A–D). The GUS
staining was progressively restrained to the distal meristem (Figure 4F, and 4G) and it strongly accumulated in
both the columella and the adjacent lateral root cap cells
at a later developmental stage (Figure 4I–K). In mature LR

or primary roots of 10-day-old seedlings no staining was
detected within the root tip.
The AtWOX13 expression pattern was also investigated
using the AtWOX13::GUS lines, during plant development. In 5-day-old seedlings, the promoter activity was
strong in both cotyledon and root vasculatures, the pericycle and in the stem cells of the primary root meristem
(Figure 4M and 4N). No GUS staining was detected in the
division zone of the root. In the vegetative apex of 10 dayold seedlings, a strong staining was observed in the leaf
primordia (Figure 4O). In the flower, the AtWOX13 promoter was active in the vasculature, the stigma (Figure 4P)
and in the gynoecium at the flower stage 13/14 (Figure
4Q, and 4R). At this developmental stage, when fertilization was ongoing and pollen grains were germinating at
the tip of the gynoecium, ovules stained blue (Figure 4Q).
Later on, the young embryos remained stained (Figure
4R), but no staining was observed in mature siliques indicating that the AtWOX13 promoter was no longer active
(Figure 4S), as observed before in all the other mature
organs. During germination, soon after seed imbibition,
GUS staining was also seen within the vasculature and the
root tip, as observed in young seedlings (data not shown).
Hence, AtWOX13 expression was restricted to differentiating organs and therefore probably regulated by developmental signals.
AtWOX14 promoter specificity differs from that of
AtWOX13
Compared to the AtWOX13 expression patterns, the activity of AtWOX14 was more restrictive during lateral root
formation. As for AtWOX13, the AtWOX14 promoter
activity, revealed by GUS staining, was detected in the LR
primordia, but decreased progressively as the LR emerged
becoming restricted in fine to the vasculature up to the LR
junction (Figure 5A–C). The AtWOX13::GUS gene continued to be expressed for a longer time (compare Figure 5B
with Figure 4C). In 5-day-old seedlings, AtWOX14 driven
GUS activity was only found in the vascular system and in
the pericycle of the primary root (Figure 5D). In the LR of

14-day-old seedlings (Figure 5E), GUS staining was again
observed in the vasculature and the pericycle with
AtWOX14 expression being progressively induced in the
pericycle and in the vasculature as the LR developed.
Compared to the activity of the AtWOX13 promoter,

AtWOX14 mutant line, (3) Wild type WS ecotype, (4) the
193G10 AtWOX13 mutant line, (5) Genomic DNA control.

AtWOX14::GUS expression stopped at a longer distance
further up from the root tip (Figure 5E, black arrow),
exactly at the position where the youngest LR primordia
were initiated (see arrow in Figure 5F).
During flower development, AtWOX14::GUS expression
was detected in the stamen at floral stage 11/12 (Figure
5G–I), when mitotic divisions of microspores are known
to occur [34]. The staining decreased as the stamen
matured, showing that the function of WOX14 is linked
to the early stages of organ and tissue development.
Hence, as for AtWOX13, AtWOX14 promoter activity also
seems to be regulated by developmental signals. The gene
expression profile reported in the gene atlas [35] and the
tissues and organs affected by the mutation of AtWOX14
(see below) agree with the expression profile described
above.
An AtWOX13 gene truncated downstream of the
homeodomain neither alters root nor flower development
The only available wox13 mutant line, identified in GABIKat [36] and numbered 193G10, showed a T-DNA insertion upstream of the sequence coding for the characteristic
WFQN motif located at the end of the WOX homeodomain (Figure 6A and see additional file 4: Figure 2A). RTPCR experiments carried out using polyA+-RNA, prepared
from the wox13 193G10 line, and primers matching each
side of the insertion site, did not yield any PCR product
(see Figure 3C). Because of the position of the insertion at
the end of the WOX homeodomain, we also carried out an
expression analysis using another couple of primers
matching the 5'UTR of the AtWOX13 mRNA and the left
border of the T-DNA. The latter experiment led to the
amplification of a 500 bp PCR product, the sequence of
which coded for a putative chimeric protein of 148 resi-

dues composed of the 143 amino acids of the AtWOX13
N-terminal region plus an additional 5 amino acids specified by the T-DNA sequence.
Based on the expression profiles obtained using the GUS
reporter gene constructs, an analysis of the primary root
growth of the mutant lines was carried out after seed germination. Surprisingly, the above WOX13 mutation neither affected primary root growth (Figure 6C), nor
vegetative and flower development. The only phenotype
appeared to be a much earlier floral transition (Figure 6E).
A WOX14 knock-out mutant modifies lateral root and
stamen development of A. thaliana
Conversely to the wox13 mutant, a wox14 insertion
mutant line (i.e., pst13645) with the entire WOX homeodomain deleted (Figure 6B and see additional file 4: Figure 2B) displayed developmental defects in all the organs
where GUS staining was observed. The primary root
growth was retarded (Figure 6D) and after flowering, the
pst13645 insertion line showed partial sterility (Figure
6M), with aborted and shorter siliques compared to the
wild type (Figure 6N). The floral transition was also
altered, however the phenotype observed was that of a late
flowering mutant (Figure 6F).

The wox14 mutant was further characterized during plant
development. Whereas in the wild type Nossen a fully
developed network of LR was observed (Figure 6G, H), the
LR formation in wox14 was strongly inhibited (Figure 6I,
J). The pst13645 line displayed extra adventitious roots
(see Figure 6K, L) whereas the wild type plants developed
only one or two. At the reproductive stage, observations
after tissue clearing showed that the shorter siliques of
wox14 contained many ovules that did not develop into
seeds (Figure 6P), compared to the wild type (Figure 6O).
Since the AtWOX14 promoter was only active in the developing stamen, pollen grain viability was checked using
Alexander staining. As shown in Figure 6Q and 6R, the
anthers of both the wild type and the wox14 mutant contained viable pollen grains when compared to the sterile

dmc1 RNAi line [37]. However, stamen development was
severely affected in the wox14 mutant. In open flowers of
the wild type plants, the stamens were longer than the
gynoecium allowing complete fertilization of the ovule
(Figure 6T). In contrast, in the mutant line, the stamen did
not fully develop and remained shorter than the gynoecium thereby preventing efficient fertilization and causing ovule abortion. In some wox14 flowers, the phenotype
was even more severe, with aborted stamens that developed to only half the size of the gynoecium (Figure 6V).
These data suggested that AtWOX14 prevents premature
organ and tissue differentiation at the floral stage.

Discussion
To improve previously described and not completely congruent WOX phylogenies [14,16,38] we performed multi
alignments on protein sequences (60–61 amino acids)
longer than the usually defined HD (41–42 amino acids).
Furthermore, we used gene or protein features other than
the HD sequence to support the three OGs exhibited by
our phylogenic trees. Even if the WOX gene phylogeny
remains difficult to reconcile with species phylogeny, we
are confident about the gene distribution between the
three main OGs. Only one WOX gene was detected in the
basal unicellular and photosynthetic organism O. tauri
and three WOX genes were identified in moss P. patens,
including at least two functional paralogues. The WOX13
OG is the clade containing the most conserved WOX
genes as it is the only clade that contains the O. tauri, the
P. patens and probably the eight S. moellendorffii genes. It
also showed a recent and specific expansion in Brassicaceae. These observations point out the interest in the
study of the WOX13 OG with respect to its biological specificity and gene family evolution.
WOX14 orthologues are only observed in Brassicaceae
species
We detected AtWOX13 and AtWOX14 mRNAs at different
stages of plant development, in plantlets, roots, flowers
and developing embryos. These expression profiles were
in accordance with those described in a compendium of

A. thaliana expression databases for the WOX13 OG genes
[30-33]. For instance, in the gene expression map of the
Arabidopsis root [39], the AtWOX13 mRNA profile shows
a localized expression domain (LED) specific to the stele
in the elongation zone of the mature primary root as
observed in our study. These databases also revealed that
the expression levels of both AtWOX14 and AtWOX13
were low compared to other WOX genes, suggesting either
a tight control of their expression or a cell specific expression pattern. This has been confirmed by the expression
data described in this paper.
The AtWOX14 branch within the WOX13 OG, has previously been suggested to be unique to A. thaliana [14]. Our
study based on more species indicates that this branch
also contains sequences from other Brassicaceae. Interestingly, differences in the expression profiles between
AtWOX14 and AtWOX13 indicate that their 5' regulatory
elements have diverged since gene duplication. In line
with this conclusion, our data mining analyses showed
that AtWOX13 expression, but not that of AtWOX14, was
modulated in response to biotic and abiotic stresses.
Hence, the AtWOX14 promoter appears to have diverged
to presumably support specific developmental mechanisms found so far only in Brassicaceae. Analysis of the
expression profile of a non Brassicaceae WOX13 gene
should give us a better understanding of the evolutionary
mechanisms giving rise to this particular branch.
WOX13 OG genes affect organogenesis and floral
transition
The control of cell proliferation and differentiation during
organ development are essential processes that require
genes implicated in cell signaling, cell identity and cell
cycle transitions. In higher plants, both the SAM and the
root pericycle cells serve as initiation sites of organogenesis [40,41]. In this paper, we show that AtWOX13 and
AtWOX14 are active in organ primordia and during early
tissue differentiation. In the transcriptomic database
CATdb [30], in which only the AtWOX13 probe is availa-

ble, 5 out of 62 experiments associate AtWOX13 gene
expression with cell proliferation and growth. Interestingly, the transcriptome profiling experiments, using protoplast cultures [42], showed that the AtWOX13 mRNA
level followed an expression profile similar to that of the
proliferating cell nuclear antigen 1 gene (see additional file
4: Figure 3A), a key regulator of DNA metabolism and cell
cycle progression [43]. Conversely, the homeobox gene
ATHB7, a marker of cell differentiation and elongation
[44], strongly decreased in the same protoplast culture.
Compared to the cell cycle gene (see additional file 4: Figure 3B), AtWOX13 expression levels were maximal when
the cells entered cell division. AtWOX13 expression was
also up-regulated in the tor mutant or after a treatment
with the IP3K inhibitor, wortmannin. The TOR protein
and IP3K are regulators of cell division and growth. TOR
has only been found in non-differentiated and rapidly
dividing meristematic cells [45,46]. However, the
dynamic expression of AtWOX13 during LR development
described in this paper does not entirely overlap with the
cell division zone, as AtWOX13 promoter activity became
more restricted to the vasculature of the root.
Our data also showed that mutations of the AtWOX13
and 14 genes affected the floral transition. An increase of
cell division in all the vegetative SAM was proposed to be
a prerequisite for morphological changes at the floral
transition in plants [47,48]. Furthermore, in A. thaliana
stem axis growth is the result of cell elongation that occurs
only in the rib zone and not in the upper part of the SAM
[49]. Hence, the late flowering phenotype observed in the
wox14 mutant might reflect a default in the coordination
of cell division and elongation in the transitional SAM. In
contrast, the wox13 mutant line showed a surprising early
floral transition. However, a chimeric WOX13 mRNA coding for a putative protein containing the conserved
domains was expressed in the wox13 193G10 line. We
suggest that this line might act as a dominant negative
mutant that induces early floral transition by activating
precocious cell proliferation in the SAM. Alternatively, we

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:291

cannot exclude that other WOX family members could
fulfill the function of the AtWOX13 protein, leading to a
weak phenotype in the Arabidopsis mutant background.
To date, the mechanism underlying gene regulation by the
homeobox gene family is complex and remains largely
unclear [50]. A monitoring of the promoter activity during
the floral transition and an analysis of a mutant line with
an insertion upstream of the HD or an RNAi strategy
should give us better insights into the function of the
WOX13 protein.
Finally, we found that the wox14 null mutant showed root
growth delay and early anther maturation. Interestingly, a
similar phenotype was also observed in anthers when cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors were ectopically
expressed in plants [51-53]. Hence, it is tempting to speculate that the AtWOX14 protein is involved in the negative control of cell differentiation to allow for correct
development.
In a similar way, the expression profile observed during
the gametophytic development of P. patens is consistent
with a putative function in cell differentiation control during the filamentous growth and the bud formation
although in situ hybridization experiment are needed to
validate this hypothesis. Last, the constitutive expression
of the only WOX gene in O. tauri may account for its
maintenance in an undifferentiated state. Future use of O.
tauri and P. patens as biological models and ongoing complementation experiments of mutants using either full
length or truncated proteins should allow us to obtain a
better understanding of the functional importance of the
WOX13 OG genes.

Conclusion
Our data provide evidence in favor of the WOX13 OG as
the clade containing the most conserved WOX genes. The
preferential presence of amino acid motifs fully supports
the separation of the different gene groups in the phylogenetic trees. However, the latter is not consistent with the
green plant phylogeny [21]. In this study, we linked the
function of the WOX13OG Arabidopsis members to
organ initiation and development, most likely by preventing premature differentiation as shown for other WOX
proteins. The data also suggest that the WOX family has
diverged both at the transcriptional and protein level to
generate new features that control cell identity in specific
domains of land plants. In line with such evolutionary
events, the expression profile and mutant phenotype of
the AtWOX14 gene suggest that the Brassicaceae might
have developed specific mechanisms to control floral
transition and pollen formation when compared to other
plants.

Methods
Identification of WOX genes
The identification of WOX genes was undertaken using
model plants for which the complete genome was available, i.e., A. thaliana (a core eudicot), O. sativa (a monocot), P. patens (a moss) and O. tauri (a green alga). The
WOX family was defined in A. thaliana and O. sativa
genomes after a BLASTp [54] search in the FLAGdb++
database [55] using AtWUS (AT2G17950). AtWUS-like
sequences were identified in the P. patens whole genome
shotgun database ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/TraceDB/
physcomitrella_patens/, the O. tauri [56] and the O. lucimarinus [57] genomes after a BLASTp using the HD amino
acid sequence. The limits of the sub-families were defined
following the drop-in-Blast score method [58,59]. The
structures of the identified genes were verified using all of
the corresponding transcripts and when necessary the
gene was reannotated. There was only one WOX gene,
(OT13G01350), within the O. tauri and the O. lucimarinus
genomes. Gene and protein sequences of the WOX families from completely sequenced genomes of model species are given (see additional file 3: Table 1). The positions
of introns were obtained from nucleotide sequence alignments derived from the protein alignments. Only introns
inserted into genomic regions coding for sufficiently similar protein sequences were used to study the conservation
of intron insertion sites.

The proteome of S. moellendorffii was downloaded from
the JGI ftp site ftp://ftp.jgi-psf.org/pub/JGI_data/
Selaginella_moellendorffii/. Using the WOX-HD HMM
(see additional file 3: Table 2), we found 8 WOX
sequences, but only 3 were apparently full-length. Only
the complete SmWOX sequences were used for the phylogeny reconstruction of the WOX family.
Distance trees and phylogeny reconstruction of the WOX
family
Neighbor-Joining (NJ) [60], Maximum likelihood (ML)
[61] trees, both based on Jones-Taylor-Thornton matrix
[62], and Parsimony [63] trees were constructed using
PHYLIP [64]. To assess support for the calculated relationships, 1000 bootstrap samples were generated [65]. To
select appropriate outgroups for the WOX model plant
phylogeny, we first established a tree using all of the HD
proteins from A. thaliana and 3 outgroups (i.e.,
At3G03260, At4G00730, At4G17710) were chosen from
the three clades closest to the WOX clade. Trees were computed from 60 to 61 amino acid sequences containing the
HD of the WOX proteins from the five plant model
genomes, O. tauri, P. patens, S. moellendorffii (only the 3
available full-length proteins were used), A. thaliana and
O. sativa. The clustering of the WOX proteins in three different OGs obtained from the genome models were consistent using both NJ (Figure 1) and ML (see additional

Page 14 of 19

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:291

file 1: Figure 1) methods and the 3 above outgroups either
independently or together (data not shown). We also
built up phylogenetic tree from the same set of data using
the Parsimony method. Different branching patterns were
obtained depending upon which outgroup was used.
With the multiple outgroup described above, O. tauri and
S. moellendorffii were both independent branches at the
base of the tree (see additional file 1: Figure 2).
The WOX13 OG trees has been established using the
Neighbor-Joining [60] method based on Henikoffs evolutionary distances [66]. The trees obtained with the ML (see
additional file 1: Figure 3) and Parsimony methods (see
additional file 1: Figure 4) also gave the same main clusters of proteins.
Analysis of WOX protein sequences
In order to identify shared motifs among the protein
sequences we used the MEME program, version 3.5.4 [67].
A gapped alignment using CLUSTALW was generated for
each motif. Based on these multiple alignments a Hidden
Markov Model (HMM) was built using HMMER 2.3.2
[20]. The HMM was used to search for motifs in the WOX
sequences from the model genomes and in the whole proteome in GenBank NR (see additional file 3: Table 2). The
sequence logos were made using Weblogo [68]. The specificity of the HMMs for the different WOX clades was
tested using the two recently available Vitis vinifera
genome sequences, PN40024 [69] and Pinot noir [70].
Using the WOX HD HMMs, an initial search in these two
novel proteomes allowed us to specifically retrieve all
members of the WOX gene family. A second search with
the clade specific HMMs efficiently clustered the WOX
genes into one of the three WOX clades (see additional file
3: Table 3). We found 13 different Vitis genes coding for
WOX proteins, with 8 located in the WOX1 OG, 3 in the
WOX13 OG, and 2 in the WOX8 OG. No V. vinifera proteins were located to the WOX14 clade.
Plant material
A naturally synchronized O. tauri strain OTTH0595 cell
culture was used and the cell cycle analysed by flow
cytometry as described by Farinas et al [27]. Using a 12 h
light/dark condition, we obtained two subpopulations of
synchronized cells at the light/dark transition, comprised
of 12% cells in the G2/M phase and the remaining cells in
the S phase of the cell-cycle. The moss P. patens was grown
on BCD medium [71] overlaid with cellophane under 16
h light/8 h dark cycle at 65% hygrometry and at 20°C. The
DS transposon tagged A. thaliana line wox14, i.e.,
pst13645, was obtained from the RIKEN BRC Japan. The
T-DNA tagged A. thaliana line wox13, i.e., 193G10, was
purchased from the INRA Versailles resource centre. The
wox13 and wox14 mutant lines are in the Wassilewskija
(Ws) and the Nossen (No) background, respectively. Wild

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/291

type plants of both ecotypes were used as background
controls.
Root growth assays
Sterile seeds were placed on a solid growth medium (MS
salt supplemented with 20 g/L sucrose and agar) at 4°C
for 2 days, and grown under 16 h light/8 h dark cycles
(20°C during illumination, 18°C in the dark) at 65%
hygrometry. Root length was measured from day 3 to day
6 using the ImageJ free software (NIH, USA) after scanning.
Characterization of the mutant lines
The pst13645 and 193G10 lines were screened using
media containing either 30 mg/L hygromycin or 30 mg/L
kanamycin, respectively. In order to verify the mapping of
the insertion site, F2 or F3 plants were genotyped at the
AtWOX13, At WOX14 loci. Specific genomic DNA primers
and either T-DNA or the Ds-element border-specific primers were designed based on the annotated insertion site of
each mutant line (see additional file 4: Table 1). The
resulting PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose
gel and their size was verified. 341 bp and 163 bp fragments were expected for the AtWOX13 wild type and
mutated allele, respectively and 498 bp and 216 bp fragments for the AtWOX14 wild type and mutated allele,
respectively. Moreover, the entire AtWOX14-AtWOX10
DNA region was genotyped to check for the absence of
chromosome rearrangements of the duplicates and to
confer that the phenotype was only due to the disruption
of AtWOX14. Phenotypes were observed only in
homozygous plants for each mutation and therefore they
were used in all further experiments.
Reverse transcriptase PCR
Total RNA was extracted from the different plants using
the Qiagen plant RNeasy extraction kit and DNAseI
treated following the manufacturer's instructions. The
RNA preparations were reverse transcribed using 1 to 5 μg
of RNA. RT-PCR experiments were performed in order to
verify the expression of the different WOX and control
genes (see additional file 4: Table 1) within the different
plant model species and the transgenic Arabidopsis
plants. Primer efficiency was tested using genomic DNA
and eventual genomic contamination was always checked
by PCR amplification of the RNA samples using the equivalent amount of cDNA used for the RT-PCR. Quantitative
real-time RT-PCR was also performed on O. tauri mRNA
as described previously [72] using a Roche Light Cycler ®
480 with the SYBER© green PCR mix from either Roche or
Applied Biosystem. For each gene tested, PCR products
from genomic DNA cloned into the PGEMT© vector and
the NotI digested empty plasmid were used as standards to
quantify the corresponding RNA copy number. These raw

copy numbers were then normalized to the amount of
equivalent RNA used for the quantification.
Construction of the WOX::GUS reporter genes
To clone the AtWOX13 and AtWOX14 promoters, the
entire intergenic regions upstream of the ATG initiators
were PCR-amplified using gene specific primers containing either an XbaI or a BamHI restriction site (5'-TCTCGAGTGGAGCTTTTGCAGGTCTCT-3'; 5'-AGGATCCTCAG
AATTTCGCTCAGAAGATTT-3') for AtWOX13 and containing either a NotI or a SpeI restriction site (5'GACAGCGGCCGCGGGGTTGTGAGTCCTATTGC-3'; 5'GACACTAGTTGAACAAGACAATGAGAAAGTGAA-3') for
AtWOX14. DNA fragments (of 3.6 kb and 1 kb for the
AtWOX13 and AtWOX14 promoters, respectively) were
subcloned into the pGEMT vector (Promega) to give the
prom WOX13 and prom WOX14 plasmids. For the
WOX::GUS reporter constructs, prom WOX13 XhoI/
BamHI and prom WOX14 SpeI fragments were subcloned
into a SalI/BamHI and an XbaI digested pPR97 binary vector, respectively [73]. Constructs were introduced into the
Agrabacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101, then into Arabidopsis plants ecotype Ws as described in [74]. Transformed plants were selected by adding 30 mg/L
kanamycin to the growth medium. Resistant plants were
transferred to soil and grown in a growth chamber.
Staining and observations
Beta-glucuronidase (GUS) staining was performed for 24
h on T1 and T2 seedlings as previously described [75],
except for the lateral roots where the incubation time was
limited to 4 h. After fixing and clearing, samples were
mounted on slides in HCG (80% Chloral hydrate, 10%
Glycerol, 10% water) and observed under a Zeiss light
microscope or a Zeiss binocular. Cytological observations
of Alexander-stained anthers were carried out as previously described [76].
In situ hybridization
In situ hybridizations were conducted as previously
described [77] using antisense probes. The AtWOX13 antisense probe was synthesized in vitro using a PCR product
obtained with the following primers: (CCTGCAGATGATGGAATGGGATAATCAGC
and
TGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCACTGCTTATGACTGACTACCAAATCC). The CUC2 probe has been described
previously [77] and the GUS probe was provided by the
laboratory of P. Laufs (INRA Versailles).

WOX gene structures and protein motifs. Figure 1 : The structure of
WOX genes from model genomes. The gene structures from 4 model
genomes (Arabidopsis thaliana, AT; Oryza sativa, OS; Physcomitrella patens, Ppa; Ostreococcus tauri, OT) and three Selaginella
moellendorffii (Sm) genes are displayed following the order of the
Neighbour-joining tree in Figure 1 and aligned on their translation start.
Rectangles stand for exons while lines denote introns. Blue is for exonic
regions in UTRs and light grey is for translated exons. Five different gene
structures are given for PpaWOX02 due to the 5' UTR variants supported
by transcripts. Figure 2 : WOX proteins: Sequence alignments around
the virtual intron insertion sites. For each WOX OG, 15 amino acid
sequences both upstream and downstream introns are given. The intron
insertion sites are indicated by stars. Numbers on the left of sequences give
the intron length. Digits between stars stand for the phase of the intron
insertion site. The intron phase is defined by the position of its insertion
into a codon. An intron can be located between two codons (phase 0) or
within a codon, lying either after the first or after the second base pair
(phase 1 and phase 2 respectively). Boxes indicate conserved introns with
the same color code than in Figure 1. Figure 3 : Sequence logos of protein motifs in the WOX family. Each logo http://weblogo.berkeley.edu
consists on stack of letters, one stack for each position in the sequence. The
overall height of the stack indicates the sequence conservation at that position, while the letter's height within the stack indicates the relative information content of each amino acid at that position. The amino acid color
code is dark blue for large polar, light blue for basic, black for small polar,
green for nonpolar, orange for cysteine and purple for ambivalent amino
acids. Figure 4 : WOX motifs: alignments for motifs without Logo.
Motifs defined by less than 6 sequences cannot be shown as logo since the
sequence information at each position is too weak. Thus multiple alignments performed with Clustalw with a majority consensus are shown here
for theses motifs. Amino acid color code is the same than in Figure 2.

WOX sequences and HMM motifs. Table 1: Gene and protein
sequences of the WOX family in the model genomes A. thaliana, O.
sativa, P. patens and O. tauri. Table 2: Specificity and sensitivity of
HMM for WOX motifs. Scores can give indications to distinguish potential family -or subfamily-members from false positive. A clear drop in the
score could be detected in most cases, indicating that sequence below this
threshold did not fulfill the family model as well as above [21]. HMMER
bit scores were obtained for each motif by querying the HMM against
three protein sequence sets: WOX13 OG (33 sequences), model genome
WOX (32 sequences) and GenBank NR (Release 157). The score drops
above 50 and indicating the motifs exhibiting the highest specificities with
a given database are in bold. a: no hit was found in the set. b: no specific
hit was found in the GenBank NR database. Note that Physcomitrella
sequences from genome model WOX set are not present in GenBank NR.
c: best hits are not belonging to the WOX family and no score drop was
found. Table 3: Vitis vinifera WOX protein prediction with HMM
