Abstract
Background: Mitochondrial genome comparisons contribute in multiple ways when inferring
animal relationships. As well as primary sequence data, rare genomic changes such as gene order,
shared gene boundaries and genetic code changes, which are unlikely to have arisen through
convergent evolution, are useful tools in resolving deep phylogenies. Xenoturbella bocki is a
morphologically simple benthic marine worm recently found to belong among the deuterostomes.
Here we present analyses comparing the Xenoturbella bocki mitochondrial gene order, genetic code
and control region to those of other metazoan groups.
Results: The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Xenoturbella bocki was determined. The
gene order is most similar to that of the chordates and the hemichordates, indicating that this
conserved mitochondrial gene order might be ancestral to the deuterostome clade. Using data
from all phyla of deuterostomes, we infer the ancestral mitochondrial gene order for this clade.
Using inversion and breakpoint analyses of metazoan mitochondrial genomes, we test conflicting
hypotheses for the phylogenetic placement of Xenoturbella and find a closer affinity to the
hemichordates than to other metazoan groups. Comparative analyses of the control region reveal
similarities in the transcription initiation and termination sites and origin of replication of
Xenoturbella with those of the vertebrates. Phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial sequence
indicate a weakly supported placement as a basal deuterostome, a result that may be the effect of
compositional bias.
Conclusion: The mitochondrial genome of Xenoturbella bocki has a very conserved gene
arrangement in the deuterostome group, strikingly similar to that of the hemichordates and the
chordates, and thus to the ancestral deuterostome gene order. Similarity to the hemichordates in
particular is suggested by inversion and breakpoint analysis. Finally, while phylogenetic analyses of
the mitochondrial sequences support a basal deuterostome placement, support for this decreases
with the use of more sophisticated models of sequence evolution.

Background
Mitochondria have evolved from eubacterial endosymbionts related to the α-proteobacteria [1]. The primitive
state for the mitochondrial genome probably resembled
that found in the protozoan Reclinomonas americana,
which has a 69,034 bp genome which still retains eubacterial features of genome organisation such as operons
[2]. During their evolutionary history, many mitochondrial genomes have been reduced in size, having lost
many genes, some of which have been transferred to the
nucleus. As a result, mitochondrial genomes vary widely
in size and structure amongst animals, plants, fungi and
protists. Within the Metazoa, however, mitochondrial
genomes show surprising conservation of size and composition [3], almost invariably containing 13 protein coding genes, 2 ribosomal genes and 22 tRNAs, necessary for
the transcription of the mitochondrially encoded genes.
The order of those genes on the mitochondrial genome
differs widely among the metazoan phyla, but can also
show surprising conservation in organisation within specific metazoan clades, such as the Vertebrata [4] and the
Ecdysozoa [5]. This striking conservation in gene order
and composition observed between certain animal phyla
is considered too complex to have arisen in any way other
than by common ancestry and can be a powerful tool for
resolving animal relationships. Breakpoint and maximum
parsimony analyses have revealed phylogenetic signal
derived from the mitochondrial gene order allowing inference of evolutionary relationships among the metazoan
phyla, and support aspects of the new animal phylogeny
(Lophotrochozoa/Ecdysozoa) [6].
The deuterostomes are a monophyletic group of animals
comprised of the chordates (vertebrates, cephalochordates and urochordates), the echinoderms, the hemichordates and the recently included xenoturbellids [7,8].
Previous morphological studies suggest alternative placements for Xenoturbella, as a basal bilaterian [9], a turbellarian flatworm [10], a sister group to the echinoderms or
hemichordates [11,12] or a bivalve mollusc [13,14].
Recent molecular studies based primarily on nuclear
genes seem to favour a placement as a sister group to the
Ambulacraria (echinoderms + hemichordates) [7,8,15].
Conversely, mitochondrial sequences support a basal
deuterostome position [16], but when amino acids with a
different genetic code are excluded, Xenoturbella was
recovered as basal ambulacrarian [7].
Traditional evolutionary morphological hypotheses
united the deuterostome phyla (other than Xenoturbellida) on the basis of radial cleavage of the embryo and of
deuterostomy, in which the anus rather than the mouth
develops from the blastopore during early embryonic
development. This grouping has largely remained robust
to molecular phylogenetic analyses (although chaetognaths and lophophorates are no longer considered deuter-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/107

ostomes), as opposed to the protostomes in which many
groupings based on morphological similarities have not
been supported by molecular data. Current molecular
phylogenetic analyses place the echinoderms and the
hemichordates together in a group called the Ambulacraria, and the chordates (vertebrates, urochordates and
cephalochordates) as their monophyletic sister group
[7,17,18].
Phylogenetic studies of 18s rRNA sequences, expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) and mitochondrial genome data
have all suggested that the benthic marine worm Xenoturbella is placed in its own phylum, at the base of the Ambulacraria [8,7,15]. This is somewhat surprising in
morphological terms, as Xenoturbella has no coelomic cavities, nor a through gut as in all the other members of the
deuterostomes. It also has no other organs, no visible
gonads nor centralized nervous system [10]. The most
obvious explanation for this apparent simplicity might be
that this animal is highly derived, and secondarily simplified. Other members of the deuterostome group, such as
the echinoderms, can also be described as highly morphologically derived: they have a unique five-fold symmetry
while all other deuterostomes are bilaterally symmetrical.
All extant echinoderms also lack gill slits [19]. In addition
to their highly derived morphology, the mitochondrial
genomes of echinoderms are fast evolving and their gene
order and genetic code varies both within and between
echinoderm classes [20]. In contrast, and rather strikingly,
the mitochondrial genomes of the vertebrates, hemichordates and Xenoturbella bocki are very similar in their gene
order [21]. This conserved mitochondrial arrangement in
3 out of 4 deuterostome phyla is an indication that it is
likely to represent the ancestral state of the deuterostome
mitochondrial gene arrangement. Amongst the protostomes and diploblasts, mitochondrial gene orders
appear to be significantly more variable [22]. Another
study of Xenoturbella's mitochondrial genome suggested
that this conserved gene arrangement supports a basal
position for Xenoturbella within the deuterostomes, and
possibly among the Bilateria [16]. But until suitably conserved outgroups are found at the base of the Bilateria, it
will be difficult to infer the ancestral bilaterian mitochondrial gene order. Recent advances in metazoan phylogenomics [15], will no doubt help in finding suitable
outgroups at the base of the Bilateria for comparison. The
full mitochondrial genomes of acoels and nemertodermatids, two phyla thought to be the most basal Bilateria, will
be of particular interest in determining the composition
of the ancestral bilaterian mitochondrial gene order. Partial mitochondrial genome sequences for the Nemertodermatid Nemertoderma westbladi and the acoel
Paratomella rubra already indicate that the gene order in
these groups is quite divergent from the ancestral deuterostome arrangement, and bears no similarity to that of
other metazoan groups [23].

An interesting feature of mitochondrial DNA (mt DNA) is
the control region, which is involved in transcription and
replication of the heavy (H) strand and mayform a stable
stem-loop structure [4]. The control region is called the Dloop region in vertebrates and its name comes from the
nascent Heavy (H) strand that displaces the parental H
strand and forms a typical D shaped structure [24]. Conserved structural features in the control region of mtDNA
have been used in evolutionary studies [25,26] and have
been extensively characterised in vertebrates [27], providing a useful comparison point to the non-vertebrate deuterostome groups including Xenoturbella.
Mitochondrial DNA primary sequences have also been
extensively used for the inference of metazoan phylogeny,
in particular in mammals and other deuterostome groups
[28,20,16]. However, phylogenetic inference from mitochondrial sequences may be complicated by a number of
misleading factors such as compositional heterogeneity
[29], strand asymmetry [30] and accelerated substitution
rates, which violate the assumptions of the commonly
used models of evolution. A useful approach to overcome
these problems is to improve the models of evolution
used to infer phylogeny from these sequences. In particular more reliable empirical replacement matrices [31], and
models that account for heterogeneities across sites [32]
and among lineages [33] may significantly improve the fit
of data to the model and therefore provide more reliable
phylogenetic estimates.
In this study, we describe the gene order, composition and
non-coding regions of the mitochondrial genome of Xenoturbella bocki. We infer the ancestral state of the mitochondrial gene order in the deuterostome common ancestor.
Using breakpoint and inversion analysis, we test conflicting
hypotheses of Xenoturbella's phylogenetic position in a tree of
the Metazoa and finally we use more sophisticated models of
amino acid substitution to infer the phylogenetic position of
Xenoturbella using mitochondrial amino acid sequence data.

Results and discussion
Mitochondrial genome structure
The mitochondrial genome of Xenoturbella bocki is a 15,234
bp circular DNA molecule, and has an A+T content of
64.48%. As in most other bilaterian mitochondrial
genomes, there are 13 protein coding genes, 22 transfer
RNAs and 2 ribosomal RNAs (rrnS and rrnL). ATG is used
as a start codon for all of the protein coding genes, except
cox2, which starts with GTG. atp6, cox3, nd3 and nd4 end on
TA and cox2 on T, while all other genes end on the usual
TAA. These attenuated stop codons are presumably completed by polyadenylation [34,35] (See additional file 1).

The gene order of the Xenoturbella bocki mitochondrial
genome is shown in figure 1. Within the deuterostome

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/107

group, the gene order of Xenoturbella bocki is most similar
to that of the conserved vertebrate gene order as well as
the hemichordate Balanoglossus carnosus, which has virtually the same gene order as the vertebrates [21]. In Xenoturbella, Balanoglossus and the vertebrates all protein
coding genes follow the same order on the plus strand
except for the control region and -nd6, the only protein
coding gene on the minus strand. In the remaining deuterostome phyla, the echinoderms and the urochordates, the
gene orders are very different, and vary extensively even
amongst the echinoderm classes [20] (figure 1). Given
that the echinoderm lineage is very derived, and considering the phylogenetic position of Xenoturbella as a separate
phylum at the base of Ambulacraria [7,8], it is likely that
the vertebrate/hemichordate/Xenoturbella arrangement
represents the ancestral gene order for the deuterostome
clade.
There are few gaps between the genes, except for a 40 bp
gap between trnE and nd1 and a 334 bp gap between trnL
and -nd6, which is likely to correspond to the control
region for the heavy (H) strand and presumably forms a
hairpin loop (additional file 1). There are a number of
gene overlaps, the most significant being a 19 bp overlap
between the end of atp8 and the start of atp6 on the same
strand but translated in different reading frames (additional file 1). atp8 and atp6 also overlap in other metazoans, and are probably transcribed together. Another 6 bp
overlap is present between the end of nd4l and the start of
nd4. This overlap is also present in the vertebrate, hagfish,
and Saccoglossus kowalevskii mitochondrial genomes. Even
though these genes are adjacent in the cephalochordates
Branchiostoma sp. and Epigonichthys sp., and in the hemichordate Balanoglossus carnosus, there is no overlap. In the
more derived echinoderm and urochordate mitochondrial genomes, these genes are not adjacent. The proximity of these genes in Xenoturbella, Hemichordata,
Vertebrata and Cephalochordata indicates that these
genes may have been adjacent in the ancestral deuterostome mitochondrion although it does not allow us to
know whether they overlapped or not. The presence of
this 6 bp overlap between the end of nd4l and the start of
nd4 in other phyla outside the deuterostomes (in the priapulid Priapulus caudatus, the brachiopod Terebratulina
retusa and the annelid Platynereis dumerilii) indicates that
this is likely to be an ancestral feature of bilterian
genomes.
There are a number of overlaps in the genes coding for
tRNAs: trnH overlaps with trnS2 by 6 bp and trnS2 overlaps with nd5 by 12 bp. Other tRNA genes which appear
to be overlapping by 1 to 2 bp at the 3' end with another
gene or tRNA may in fact be lacking these bases. The overlapping base is in all cases an A and could be later added
to the tRNA by polyadenylation [36,37].

Gene map of the Xenoturbella bocki mitochondrial genome compared to other deuterostome mitochondrial genomes
Gene map of the Xenoturbella bocki mitochondrial genome compared to other deuterostome mitochondrial
genomes. Xenoturbella bocki gene order is compared to Balanoglossus carnosus and Saccoglossus kowalevskii (two hemichordates), Homo sapiens, Branchiostoma floridae (a cephalochordate) and Gymnocrinus richeri (a crinoid echinoderm). Below: Mitochondrial gene order reconstruction for the deuterostome common ancestor. *Position of the control region is uncertain. The
most parsimonious scenario for the ancestral deuterostome was reconstructed using gene order information from species in
the echinoderm, hemichordate, Xenoturbella, vertebrate and cephalochordate lineages. The urochordate lineage was too
derived.

Genetic code changes
Shared mitochondrial genetic codes changes between
phyla are rare and complex events and can be used to infer
common ancestry [38].Xenoturbella bocki has the standard
invertebrate mitochondrial genetic code. It does not share
the ATA codon change from methionine (M) to isoleucine
(I) found in echinoderms and hemichordates. There is
one further genetic code change found in echinoderms:
AAA codes for asparagine (N) instead of lysine (K) [21]. In
the hemichordate Balanoglossus carnosus, the codon AAA is
absent however AAA codes for lysine in Saccoglossus and
this is therefore an echinoderm specific change [21]. In
Xenoturbella bocki, the AAA codon codes for lysine as in
most other invertebrates (additional file 2). The genetic
coding of ATA = I shared by echinoderms and hemichordates is an Ambulacrarian synapomorphy that is lacking
in Xenoturbella and suggests that Xenoturbellida represents an independent lineage outside of the Ambulacraria.

Reconstructing the ancestral deuterostome mitochondrial
gene order
By comparing the gene boundaries found in the mitochondrial genomes of Xenoturbella bocki, Hemichordata
(Balanoglossus carnosus and Saccoglossus kowalevskii), Vertebrata (using Homo sapiens, which has the conserved vertebrate gene order), Cephalochordata (Branchiostoma
floridae) and Echinodermata (Gymnocrinus richeri), we
inferred the ancestral deuterostome mitochondrial gene
order (figure 1).

We find that in Xenoturbella and the two hemichordates,
Saccoglossus kowalevskii and Balanoglossus carnosus, nd5 and
cob are adjacent. While the nd5, cob gene boundary is common to Xenoturbella and the hemichordates, the final location of nd6/trnE (which is present in between nd5 and cob
in the chordates) is different in the two clades suggesting
this could be a parallel change. Alternatively, there could

have been an additional translocation event in the lineage
leading to Xenoturbella. If the nd5, -nd6, trnE, cob gene
order found in non-avian vertebrates is to represent the
ancestral state, the nd5, -nd6, cob gene arrangement found
in 15 out of 20 of the sequenced echinoderm mitochondrial genomes could represent an intermediate step in the
lineage leading to the Xenoturbella and hemichordate gene
order (nd5, cob). More mitochondrial genomes within the
hemichordates and especially from the basal pterobranch
hemichordates will allow us to establish whether the nd5,
-nd6, cob arrangement or nd5, cob represents the ancestral
state.
Gene rearrangements have been shown to be more prevalent around the control region, indicating that certain
constraints operate on mitochondrial rearrangements,
and the proximity of nd5, nd6 and cob to the control
region may have resulted in convergent gene translocations. Interestingly, the nd5, cob gene order is also found
in birds [39], probably through a convergent change.
To reconstruct the gene order of the deuterostome common ancestor (figure 1), we used parsimony reconstruction, based on comparisons of the genomes of
Xenoturbella bocki, Balanoglossus carnosus, Saccoglossus kowalevskii, Branchiostoma floridae, the conserved non avianvertebrate gene order, and the crinoid Gymnocrinus richeri,
a basal echinoderm [40]. Where a consensus could not be
reached, the primitive state was determined by looking at
mitochondrial genomes within the protostomes. Minimum breakpoint reconstruction of the mitochondrial
gene order for the ancestor of all bilaterians shows that
this gene order is virtually identical to that inferred by us
for the deuterostome ancestor, with a few differences in
the position of tRNAs [6]. It has previously been argued
that this ancestral gene order might be uninformative in
terms of making assumptions about deuterostome monophyly, or even about Xenoturbella deuterostome affinities
[16]. To test this assertion, we compared the relative
scores obtained by breakpoint and inversion analysis of
alternative positions of Xenoturbella among the Bilateria

by using a large set of metazoan mitochondrial genomes
including a large number of deuterostomes.
Inversion and breakpoint analysis
To test alternative hypotheses of Xenoturbella's phylogenetic position using gene order data, we used constrained
trees based on 41 mitochondrial genomes including 12
echinoderms, 2 hemichordates, 6 urochordates, 3 ecdysozoans and 17 lophotrochozoans (additional files 3 and 4)
and calculated breakpoint scores (the number of gene
adjacencies) and inversion scores (the number of gene
inversions) for 10 alternative placements of Xenoturbella
bocki (additional file 5).

Based on gene order alone, the most parsimonious position for Xenoturbella is as a basal hemichordate (hypothesis X6, table 1). Placing Xenoturbella in this position
results in an inversion median score of 398 (i.e. one needs
to posit 398 separate inversions to explain the entire phylogeny with Xenoturbella as a basal hemichordate) and a
breakpoint score of 580 (i.e. there are 580 instances in the
phylogeny in which a descendant sequence does not share
a gene pairing with its parent sequence). It is of note that
another placement of Xenoturbella (as a basal bilaterian/
protostome/deuterostome) receives the same inversion
score. However, the inversion score is calculated under the
assumption that inversions are the only process underlying mitochondrial genome rearrangements, which is
unlikely to be true. Given that the breakpoint score does
not rely on this assumption, it is likely to represent a
slightly better estimate of distances between mitochondrial genomes [41]. It seems sensible therefore to place
more weight on the breakpoint than on the inversion
score. On this basis, we conclude that gene order evidence
favours the phylogenetic placement of Xenoturbella as sister group of the hemichordates.
Analysis of non-coding regions and transcription initiation
sites
In vertebrates, each mitochondrial DNA strand (heavy
strand and light strand) has its own control region, which

forms a stable stem-loop structure [4]. The main portion
of mitochondrial DNA involved in transcription and replication of the heavy (H) strand in vertebrates is called the
D-loop region and has been well characterised [24,27].
The vertebrate D-loop region typically lies between trnP
and trnF and is divided into three main domains:
Extended termination-associated sequences (ETAS), central domain (CD) and conserved sequence block (CSB),
each of them carrying particular conserved functional
motifs and often repeats. The ETAS region may contain a
number of repeats containing termination associated
sequences (TAS), TACAT elements, associated with premature termination of the replication cycle [42].

forms a typical stem loop structure. In the stem region of
the OL, the trinucleotide 5'-CGG-3' is considered the initiation site for light strand replication in the mouse [43].
The loop is usually C/T-rich as it seems that pyrimidine
stretches are required for the initiation of L-strand replication by an RNA primase [42].
The putative Xenoturbella bocki control region is a 334 bp
stretch between trnL and -nd6. The Xenoturbella control
region is noticeably A+T rich (79%). As a way of comparison, 3rd codon positions of the protein coding genes,
which have low structural constraints due to the redundancy of the genetic code and tend to reflect the mutational pressure acting on the genome, are clearly less A+T
rich (68%). This implies a weak structural constraint acting on the control region, even lower than that acting on

Consensus tree from bayesian analyses using different amino acid models
Consensus tree from bayesian analyses using different amino acid models. Topology and branch lengths correspond
to the consensus tree from a bayesian analysis using the MtHydro model. Values at nodes are the posterior probabilities using
the following models from left to right respectively: amino acid functional recoding, MtZoa, MtHydro and the CAT model (in
brackets). All models place Xenoturbella as a basal deuterostome. Functional recoding, MtZoa and MtHydro support paraphyletic deuterostomes, due to LBA between the urochordates and the non-bilaterians. The CAT model supports monophyletic deuterostomes, although it groups the urochordates with the echinoderms. Note that the lower the support for
paraphyletic deuterostomes, the lower the support for Xenoturbella as basal deuterostome.
the 3rd codon position or even a positive selection for
A+T. This may suggest that only a small fraction of the
control region (e.g. a few residues) is under stabilising
selective positive pressure.
Another intriguing aspect is that the Xenoturbella control
region is not strand asymmetric with respect to G and C
(GC skew 0.03) while the rest of the genome is clearly GC
skewed (-0.63 GC skew calculated on 3rd codon position,
-0.26 on the whole genome). Mitochondrial genomes
usually tend to become asymmetric towards G and C

because one strand remains single stranded for longer
compared to the other [44]. The lack of asymmetry in the
control region of Xenoturbella may suggest that this region
is permanently maintained in a double stranded condition. Vertebrates, hemichordates and crinoids show a significant GC asymmetry in their control region [45], while
basal chordates such as cephalochordates and most of the
Ambulacraria, groups that have shorter control regions
than in Xenoturbella, have a very low GC asymmetry (data
not shown). The Xenoturbella control region contains a
number of other interesting features.

The 5' end (adjacent to trnL) and the central part of the
control region are particularly AT enriched and characterised by a very low complexity. However, between positions 30 to 59 we could identify two 13 nucleotide
tandem repeat sequences (figure 2B). Interestingly, these
sequences contain putative TAS elements. The similarity
with vertebrate TAS elements is rather convincing if we
consider that these elements are generally found in
repeated sequences and are only located at one extremity
of the D-loop region in vertebrates (the 5' end, close to
trnP). We have looked for the same TAS elements in other
putative Ambulacrarian control regions, but we could not
find any. A portion of this repeat is palindromic and capable of forming a stable stem-loop structure (-11,7 Kcal/
m), which may help in the termination of replication
[45].
We were also able to detect a putative binding site for
mtTFA, the main mitochondrial transcription factor in
vertebrates. The binding site consists of a pair of palindromic sequences that are located between positions 59
(there is one nucleotide overlap with one of the TAS containing repeats) and 91. The consensus for the 2 Xenoturbella binding sites can be seen in figure 2C and is almost
identical to the consensus found in Xenopus [46]. It is also
possible to identify another pair of putative binding sites
at position 130 which partially overlap, rather than being
separated by a 0–7 nucleotide gap, as expected in a binding site for multimeric DNA binding factors. However
these putative binding sites have to be considered highly
significant, as considering the Xenoturbella D-loop region
nucleotide frequencies, we expect to find one every
50,000 nucleotides by chance.
Perhaps the most striking feature of the putative Xenoturbella D-loop is the presence of two 41 nucleotide long palindromic repeats (position 190 and 253). These repeats
are almost identical and are able to form a very stable (-51
Kcal/m) stem loop structure, characterised by a short Trich internal loop (figure 2A). We were unable to find
stem loops of this size in other ambulacrarian or chordate
D-loop regions. However, a portion of this stem has a
striking similarity with the stem region of the light strand
origin of replication (OL) of vertebrates. In figure 2D we
have aligned the OL for different vertebrate species from
human to an actinopterigyan fish (to our knowledge the
most distant chordate from humans for which a light
strand origin of replication was reported; [47]). As can be
seen, a portion of Xenoturbella stem is clearly alignable
with the OL stem of vertebrates, although we have had to
reverse the sequence of the stems before alignment. Statistically, the consensus sequence for the vertebrate OL stem
is expected to be found once in every million base pairs in
the Xenoturbella genome; consequently it is unlikely that
this similarity is a coincidence. We have looked for the
consensus of this alignment in other ambulacrarians, uro-

chordates and cephalochordates but could not find any
similar sequence.
We were unable to identify any conserved sequence
blocks (CSB) in the Xenoturbella non-coding region. These
have been found in basal cephalochordates [48] but not
in urochordates [49]. We also could not find any significant G stretches followed by AT dinucleotides as reported
to be present in some echinoderms and in hemichordates
[21].
We have detected features that are typical of vertebrate
mitochondrial control regions, such as two putative termination associated sequences (TAS), binding sites for
mtTFA and a significant similarity between the stem of the
major stem loop structure of Xenoturbella and the stem of
the vertebrates OL. These findings imply that the replication and transcription system of Xenoturbella may be more
similar to the one found in chordates than to that of
Ambulacraria, suggesting that commonalities of Xenoturbella and vertebrates may represent the ancestral state.
Phylogenetic analyses
We have performed various phylogenetic analyses using
the 13 concatenated mitochondrial proteins from 24 deuterostome species plus 7 outgroups. Perseke and colleagues reported that under certain analytical conditions
Xenoturbella unexpectedly groups with the acoelomorph
Paratomella rubra [16] among basal bilaterians and suggested that this may be correlated with the long branch
leading to the acoelomorph. In order to evaluate this, and
to test further any possible affinity of Xenoturbella with
basal bilaterians we have analyzed the affinities of the
acoelomorph in the presence and absence of the urochordates, which are characterised by accelerated substitution
rates and therefore useful for the diagnosis of long branch
artefacts (LBA). Our results show that in the absence of the
long branched urochordates, the acoelomorph is basal to
all other bilaterians (MrBayes/MtRev pp 100, tree not
shown), while Xenoturbella is recovered within the deuterostomes (100). In the presence of the urochordates, the
acoelomorph is strongly associated with the urochordates
(MrBayes pp100, tree not shown) in a deuterostome
clade, but not with Xenoturbella. These findings suggest
that the acoelomorph is genuinely subject to LBA and
consequently the reported relationship with Xenoturbella
in a basal bilaterian position is likely to be the effect of an
artefact. In the light of this, we have excluded the acoelomorph from subsequent analyses, but kept the problematic urochordates as an internal diagnostic of the ability of
different models to fit the dataset accurately and avoid
long branch artefacts.

We have run subsequent analyses of the mitochondrial
dataset using optimal models of amino acid evolution.
Using MrBayes and the mechanistic GTR model we anaPage 8 of 14

lysed amino acids recoded into 4 functional categories, as
this has been shown to be a helpful approach when dealing with problematic phylogenies ([50], see materials and
methods for more details). We have also analyzed standard 20 character state amino acid sequences using two
new empirical models of evolution, MtZoa and MtHydro,
which we have implemented ourselves in MrBayes. The
two models, in particular MtHydro, fit many mitochondrial datasets and in particular deuterostome datasets, better than MtREV (Rota-Stabelli O, Horner D, Telford MJ:
MtHydro: a partitioned model for mitogenomics studies
based on protein structural information, submitted), [31]
(see materials and methods for more details). We have
also used the CAT model, implemented in PhyloBayes
[32], which accounts for across site heterogeneities in the
amino-acid replacement process and CAT-BP, implemented in NHPhyloBayes [33]. These two models, in particular CAT-BP, have been shown to give an invaluable

improvement in the case of compositionally heterogeneous datasets such as the mitogenomic one [32].
Our results show that trees obtained using MrBayes consistently support a basal deuterostome position for Xenoturbella (see figure 3) in accordance with Perseke and
colleagues [16]. This hypothesis is strongly supported by
using the 4 amino acid functional recoding (99 pp),
while, interestingly, using MtZoa (90 pp) and MtHydro
(75 pp) the support decreases. In all the tree analyses the
urochordates branch with the long branched outgroups,
but support for this decreases from using the 4 functional
categories (98 pp) to MtZoa (90 pp) and MtHydro (73
pp). We suggest that urochordates may be used here as an
internal diagnostic of how the models fit the dataset. We
suggest that as the model tends to escape a "wrong" urochordate position (with the outgroups, making chordates
polyphyletic), the better the model fits the dataset and

reduces the amount of false phylogenetic signal. Interestingly the decrease in support for urochordates+outgroup
in the three models (98, 90, 73 respectively for functional
recoding, MtZoa and MtHydro) is proportional to the
decrease in support for a basal deuterostome position for
Xenoturbella (99, 90, 75).
Using PhyloBayes and modelling protein evolution with
the CAT model [32], Xenoturbella is still recovered as a
basal deuterostome, but with low support (61 pp) and the
urochordates are recovered as deuterostomes with high
support (95 pp), even if within paraphyletic echinoderms,
rather than with the chordates. Using CAT-BP [33], which
accounts for compositional heterogeneity within lineages,
the urochordates are finally recovered as basal chordates,
even if with tepid support (pp 57) (see figure 4). Interestingly, using CAT-BP the position of Xenoturbella is unresolved, implying that signal supporting a basal
deuterostome position for Xenoturbella finally decreases to
below 50%.
The ability of a model to handle problematic taxa, such as
the urochordates, is a clear indication that this model fits
the dataset well. The overall scenario of our tree searches
suggests that the better the model is able to cope with the
problematic urochordates, the weaker the support for
Xenoturbella as basal deuterostome. Our tentative conclusion is that more adequate models recognise the apparent
signal placing Xenoturbella in a basal deuterostome position as false, leaving the tree topology unresolved by mitochondrial gene sequences. We finally compared three
competing tree topologies using the AU test and implementing the MtZoa model. Results indicate that the
favoured tree topology is that of Xenoturbella as basal deuterostome (p value 0.808). However, a position as a basal
Ambulacrarian (sister to hemichordates and echinoderms) is not rejected and has a p value of 0.247, much
higher than the threshold for rejection that is 0.05. As a
way of comparison, a basal chordate position for Xenoturbella is rejected at a level of 0.041.
Previous phylogenetic analyses based on the small ribosomal subunit [8] and large EST datasets [7,15] support a
position of Xenoturbella as a basal Ambulacrarian. The
basal deuterostome position obtained with the mitochondrial dataset using different models possibly reflects the
compositional bias coming from mitochondrial genetic
code changes in the lineage leading to Ambulacraria.
When these amino acids (M, I, N, K) with a different
genetic code in ambulacrarian mitochondrial genomes
are excluded from the analyses, Xenoturbella is recovered
as a basal ambulacrarian [7].

Conclusion
Comparative analyses of the mitochondrial genome structure of Xenoturbella bocki with those of other deuteros-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/107

tomes and bilaterians have revealed a number of
characteristics linking it to the deuterostome clade.
Although the Xenoturbella mitochondrial gene order is
very conserved and resembles the gene order found in the
deuterostome ancestor (and possibly the bilaterian ancestor), breakpoint and inversion scores have revealed a
closer similarity to the hemichordates. Additionally, analyses of transcription and replication initiation sites in the
control region show a number of domains typical of vertebrate mitochondrial control regions. Together these
results suggest that even though Xenoturbella seems morphologically derived within the deuterostomes (due to a
dramatically simplified body plan), many structural and
organisational aspects of its mitochondrial genome
appear to be ancestral for the deuterostome group.
Finally, while standard phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial sequences support a basal deuterostome placement, the use of more sophisticated models of sequence
evolution, specifically designed to counteract obvious systematic biases such as the known changes in genetic code
amongst the deuterostomes, show decreasing support for
this placement. We conclude that the mitochondrial
genome sequence cannot be used to contradict the results
derived from the much more comprehensive datasets of
nuclear proteins and ribosomal RNAs which consistently
show that Xenoturbella is the sister group of the Ambulacraria.

Methods
Mitochondrial genome sequencing
The complete mitochondrial genome of Xenoturbella bocki
was obtained using a combination of conventional PCR
and long PCR to amplify overlapping fragments spanning
the whole mitochondrial genome. Specimens were collected by dredging in soft muddy sediment at around 60
m depth in the Gullmarsfjord close to Kristineberg Marine
Station, Sweden. Individual live specimens were starved
for 3 weeks and used whole for DNA extraction. The tissue
was ground in homogenisation buffer using a pellet pestle. Nuclei were removed by centrifuging 3 × 10 minutes
at 1500 g at 4°C. Mitochondria, suspended in the supernatant, were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10
minutes at 4°C and mtDNA extracted using the Wizard
Minipreps DNA Purification System (Promega). Initially,
cox3, nd4, rrnL and rrnS were amplified by conventional
PCR using degenerate primers designed from published
deuterostome mitochondrial sequence alignments (additional file 6). These PCR products were cloned and
sequenced and the data were used in conjunction with
already published cox1 and cox2 sequences to design specific Xenoturbella primers to amplify large overlapping
regions of the Xenoturbella mitochondrial genome using
long PCR. All fragments were cloned and sequenced as
described below. For amplifications of 2 kb or less, PCR
products were amplified using Titanium Taq DNA

extraction kit (Quiagen), cloned in TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen), and sequenced using fluorescent dye terminator
(Applied Biosystems). The sequencing reactions were run
on an Applied Biosystems 377 automated sequencer.
Long PCRs (GeneAmp XL PCR kit, Applied Biosystems)
were carried out using specific primers in the cox1, cox2,
cox3, nd4, rrnL and rrnS genes. Fragment sizes and primer
sequences can be found in additional file 6. PCR program:

extend: 94°C, 30 sec; 65°C, 10 min. 1 cycle, final extension: 72°C, 10 minutes. PCR products (additional file 6)
were cloned using the TOPO XL PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen). Plasmids were checked for inserts by restriction
digest at the multiple cloning site. Transposons insertion
(EZ-Tn5 <TET-1>, Epicentre) was carried out for 2 hours
at 37°C. Colonies were grown on LB agar containing Tetracycline and Kanamycin, to select for tranposon insertions within the insert. Clones containing random
transposon insertions were sequenced in both orientations, using priming sites in the transposon (TET-1 FP-1:
5'-GGGTGCGCATGATCCTCTAGAGT-3' and TET-1 RP-1:
5'-TAAATTGCACTGAAATCTAGAAATA-3').
Annotation and alignment of mtDNA
Sequences were edited and overlapping contigs assembled
using Lasergene V.7 (DNASTAR, Lasergene). Gene
sequences were identified using BLAST and by alignment
with mitochondrial sequences from other species (ClustalX). The genome sequence was deposited in GenBank,
accession number DQ832701.
Xenoturbella mitochondrial genetic code determination
This was done as described in Telford et al. [38].
Breakpoint analysis
A phylogeny of 41 metazoan species (additional files 3
and 4) with sequenced mitochondrial genomes was constructed based on recent molecular phylogenetic studies
[19,51-56]. Mitochondrial gene orders (including tRNAs)
were downloaded from the OGRE database http://
drake.physics.mcmaster.ca/ogre/, and more recently published gene orders which were not available on the OGRE
database
were
taken
from
NCBI
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/ORGANELLES/
mztax_short.html. Accession numbers can be found in
additional file 3.

Species whose mitochondrial genomes have divergent
gene content (different from the 13 protein coding and 24

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/107

structural RNA genes typical of bilaterian animals) were
not included in the analysis, due to limitations of the
method of inferring ancestral gene orders [57,58]. Furthermore, in order to simplify the analysis, the Homo sapiens gene order was taken to be representative of the highly
conserved vertebrate gene order, and the Limulus
polyphemus gene order was taken to be representative of
the highly conserved arthropod gene order [59]. For all
other taxa, the maximum possible number of genome
sequences were included in the analysis, given available
genome and phylogenetic information. A summary of the
assumed phylogeny is shown in additional file 4.
Inversion median and breakpoint scores were then calculated using the Circal package [57,58] for 10 different phylogenetic trees, in each of which the Xenoturbella sequence
was placed in a different position on the phylogeny (additional file 5). In this way, it was possible to assess the best
supported position of Xenoturbella within a phylogeny of
the Metazoa based on gene order evidence.
Control region
We searched for repeats in the non coding regions with
TRF [60] and REPFIND [61]. We used Transfac [62], PATSEARCH [63] and RERNA http://regrna.mbc.nctu.edu.tw
to look for conserved patterns and binding sites. We calculated the expected occurrence of a certain nucleotide
motifs in the Xenoturbella control region by simple multiplication of the expected frequency of each nucleotide or
class of nucleotide, using the nucleotide frequency of the
Xenoturbella major control region.
Phylogenetic analyses and tests of alternative hypotheses
We retrieved the 13 protein sequences of 30 metazoan
species from the OGRe. database http://drake.phys
ics.mcmaster.ca/ogre/[22], GenBank accession numbers:
NC_001912, NC_006465, NC_001131, NC_002639,

NC_009833, NC_006627, NC_002177, NC_008164,
NC_006894, NC_008151. We aligned protein sequences
with MUSCLE [64]. The concatenated alignment was
refined by hand and poorly conserved or ambiguously
aligned codons were excluded from further analyses.
Application of Gblocks [65] at default settings lead to a
final alignment of 2572 reliably aligned amino acids. We
have selected 7 outgroup species from the protostomes
and non bilaterian metazoans on the basis of reduced
compositional divergence, in accordance with the optimal
outgroup selection of Rota-Stabelli and Telford [66]. We
have also added available sequences from the Acoelomorph Paratomella rubra (AY228758).

Most of the tree searches were performed with the program
MrBayes v3.1 under different models of evolution. We have
used two new empirical models of mitochondrial amino
acid evolution, MtZoa and MtHydro and recompiled
MrBayes substituting these new models for existing ones
[31], (Rota-Stabelli O, Horner D, Telford MJ: MtHydro: a
partitioned model for mitogenomics studies based on protein structural information, submitted). While MtREV is
based on the analysis of vertebrate species only, both MtZoa
and MtHydro models have been estimated from the alignment of the 13 mitochondrial proteins from a large sample
of 100 Metazoans, which contains many non-vertebrates
deuterostomes, meaning that MtZoa and MtHydro may be a
better estimator of animal mitochondrial evolution. Both
models have been estimated using the maximum likelihood
approach implemented in PAML [67] and assuming reversibility of the replacement process. MtHydro is based on the
crystallographic structure of cytochrome oxidase b and complex IV subunits and bioinformatic prediction, which have
been used to generate two partitions: one containing hydrophobic alpha-helices and one containing the remaining
mostly hydrophilic sites. From the two partitions we have
estimated two corresponding substitution matrices, which
are characterized by different amino acid frequencies and
replacement rates and are intended to be used simultaneously as a single model when modelling corresponding partitioned datasets (Rota-Stabelli O, Horner D, Telford MJ:
MtHydro: a partitioned model for mitogenomics studies
based on protein structural information, submitted).
MtZOA is a general empirical model which implies amongsite homogeneity, as in MtRev: all sites of the alignment are
treated equally and modelled using the same replacement
matrix and stationary frequencies [31].
Tests of model fit using AIC and BIC methods show that the
two models, in particular MtHydro, are preferable to existing
empirical models such as MtREV, when a dataset of deuterostomes is analyzed. We have also recoded amino acids into 4
functional groups according to amino acid chemical and
physical properties. We partially based the groupings on the
six classical groups of amino acids [50], and reduced them to
four classes in order to analyze them under the 4 × 4 GTR
model implemented in MrBayes 3.1. Groupings were as follows: group 1 (aromatic): FYW, group 2 (hydrophobic):
VMLIC, group 3 (small): AGPSTNQ and group 4 (charged):
HKRDE. It has been shown that functional recording is an
effective means of decreasing nonphylogenetic signal and may
help to infer phylogeny in the case of problematic taxa [50].
For all the MrBayes analyses, we used an invariable plus
eight gamma distribution for modelling sites rate categories. We have run 2 MCMC chains for each dataset and
stopped when the standard deviation of split frequencies
between the two runs was less than 0.02.
Additional tree searches were made with the program PhyloBayes [32] and NhPhyloBayes [33], which respectively

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/107

implement the models CAT and CAT-BP. While both
models assigned different sites of the alignment to different classes characterised by different equilibrium frequencies [32], CAT-BP also accounted for compositional
heterogeneity among lineages, which is an invaluable
improvement in the case of compositionally heterogenic
mitochondrial sequences [66]. We ran two independent
chains in both PhyloBayes and NH-PhyloBayes. We
stopped the chains when the largest discrepancy across
bipartitions reached 0.15 in PhyloBayes. Statistical tests of
the robustness of tree topologies have been evaluated with
the Approximately Unbiased (AU) test of Shimodaira [68]
and were performed on the nucleotide dataset using the
software CONSEL [68] with site likelihood scores
exported from PAML [69] and calculated using the MtZoa
model and the tree topologies from MrBayes trees
searches.
The MtZoa and MtHydro matrices are available at: http://
