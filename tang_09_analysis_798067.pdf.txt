Abstract
Background: Detailed information regarding the number and organization of transfer RNA
(tRNA) genes at the genome level is becoming readily available with the increase of DNA
sequencing of whole genomes. However the identification of functional tRNA genes is challenging
for species that have large numbers of repetitive elements containing tRNA derived sequences,
such as Bos taurus. Reliable identification and annotation of entire sets of tRNA genes allows the
evolution of tRNA genes to be understood on a genomic scale.
Results: In this study, we explored the B. taurus genome using bioinformatics and comparative
genomics approaches to catalogue and analyze cow tRNA genes. The initial analysis of the cow
genome using tRNAscan-SE identified 31,868 putative tRNA genes and 189,183 pseudogenes,
where 28,830 of the 31,868 predicted tRNA genes were classified as repetitive elements by the
RepeatMasker program. We then used comparative genomics to further discriminate between
functional tRNA genes and tRNA-derived sequences for the remaining set of 3,038 putative tRNA
genes. For our analysis, we used the human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, horse, dog, chicken and fugu
genomes to predict that the number of active tRNA genes in cow lies in the vicinity of 439. Of this
set, 150 tRNA genes were 100% identical in their sequences across all nine vertebrate genomes
studied. Using clustering analyses, we identified a new tRNA-GlyCCC subfamily present in all
analyzed mammalian genomes. We suggest that this subfamily originated from an ancestral tRNAGlyGCC gene via a point mutation prior to the radiation of the mammalian lineages. Lastly, in a
separate analysis we created phylogenetic profiles for each putative cow tRNA gene using a
representative set of genomes to gain an overview of common evolutionary histories of tRNA
genes.
Conclusion: The use of a combination of bioinformatics and comparative genomics approaches
has allowed the confident identification of a set of cow tRNA genes that will facilitate further
studies in understanding the molecular evolution of cow tRNA genes.

Background
Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are members of a family of ubiquitous molecules that provide the essential link between
the genetic code and amino acids. tRNAs are a central
component of ribosomal protein biosynthesis that acts by
decoding template messenger RNA (mRNA) into the
amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Although
the mechanistic role of tRNA in protein synthesis is well
understood, evidence illustrating the complexity of evolution and expression of tRNA genes continues to emerge
[1-3].
The tRNA multigene family usually comprises 20 amino
acid accepting groups; each group may contain one or
more tRNA members that recognize different codons
commonly referred to as tRNA isoacceptors. Generally,
the number of tRNA isoacceptors is highly variable
amongst different genomes [4]. While variations in tRNA
isoacceptor numbers is positively correlated to codon
usage in bacteria and yeast [5], such correlation is absent
in more advanced eukaryotic genomes such as frogs and
humans [6]. tRNA isoacceptors usually exhibit close
sequence similarity as they conserve the same sequence
and structural elements used for identification by the
same class of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases [7]. However,
in some cases tRNAs that charge different amino acids
share higher sequence similarity than respective tRNAs in
the same isoaccepting group [8]. This interesting observation may be explained by a phenomenon called "tRNA
gene recruitment" where a tRNA from one amino acid
family can be recruited to another family via a single point
mutation [9]. These tRNA gene recruitment events complicate the evolutionary history of tRNA genes. However,
a phylogenetic approach utilizing complete sets of tRNA
genes from different genomes will allow us to trace a more
complete history of tRNA genes and gain insight into the
evolutionary processes that have shaped modern tRNA
repertoires.
With the advent of multiple genome sequencing projects,
entire tRNA repertoires have been identified in many
genomes. While features of tRNA genes are well defined,
predicting functional tRNA genes in eukaryotic genomes
can be difficult. Sequencing of vertebrate genomes
revealed that tRNA-derived sequences are often contained
within retrotransposon insertions that give rise to different families of short interspersed elements (SINEs) [10].
In the genomes of animals, the number of SINEs present
often exceeds 104 [11]. For example, approximately 1.6%
of the Bos taurus genome is predicted to comprise of SINEs
containing tRNA-derived sequences [12]. These complications present a serious challenge for the accurate annotation of biochemically active tRNA genes as SINEs often
retain many sequence and structural features of the
authentic tRNA genes [10,13].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/188

Identification of functional non-coding RNAs in genomic
sequences depends heavily on the analysis of conserved
RNA secondary structure in order to make accurate predictions [14]. The most commonly used program for making
tRNA predictions is tRNAscan-SE [15], a program that
analyzes intrinsic features of known functional tRNA
genes including the internal Pol III promoter sites and
conserved tRNA secondary structure. However, tRNAscanSE produces large numbers of false positives in genomes
where tRNA related sequences and SINEs are common
[16,17]. For the prediction and annotation of mouse
tRNA genes, the strategy to counter this problem was to
identify SINEs that have been predicted as tRNA genes and
use comparative genomics to identify functional tRNA
genes [16]. In that study, SINEs were identified using
RepeatMasker [18], a program that identifies putative
repeat elements in genomic sequences by comparison to a
pre-compiled database of repetitive elements. Although
RepeatMasker can effectively identify many genomic
repeat sequences, it is unable to identify novel lineagespecific SINEs. To overcome this, a comparative genomics
approach using the human genome was used to identify
sets of orthologous tRNA genes that are probably functional. This strategy allowed the refining of a large set of
putative mouse tRNA genes (2,764) to a smaller set of
possibly functional mouse tRNA genes (335) [16].
For our analysis of the B. taurus genome, we were challenged by a large number of tRNA-like sequences due to
SINE activity. In order to provide a comprehensive annotation of functional tRNA genes in the B. taurus genome
we used a combination of approaches which involved
tRNAscan-SE, RepeatMasker and comparative genomics
to overcome the issue of SINEs. We then conducted cluster
analyses on our set of putative tRNA genes, to gain insight
into the evolutionary histories of cow tRNA genes. This in
turn will help further the understanding of tRNA gene
evolution.

Results
Identification of cow tRNA genes
The initial analysis of the cow genome using tRNAscan-SE
identified 191,073 and 29,978 tRNA-like sequences positioned evenly across assembled cow chromosomes and
unordered genomic contigs respectively (Table 1, Additional file 1). Of these sequences, 163,490 and 25,693 on
the assembled chromosomes and unordered contigs
respectively were classified as pseudogenes by tRNAscanSE. Together this is by far the largest reported number of
tRNA-like sequences amongst vertebrate genomes, demonstrating the extent of amplification of tRNA-derived
sequences in the cow. In comparison similar analyses performed in other mammals identified a total of 2,764
tRNA genes and 22,314 pseudogenes in the mouse
genome [16], a total of 175,943 tRNA genes and pseudo-

genes in the rat genome [17] and 497 tRNA genes and 324
tRNA pseudogenes in the human genome [19]. All these
data illustrate a great variability in tRNA-derived sequence
copy numbers owing mainly to the activity of SINEs
[16,17,19]. Given the large numbers of tRNA-like
sequences identified in our initial analysis, we reasoned
that the remaining sets of 27,583 and 4,285 putative tRNA
genes on assembled chromosomes and unordered contigs
respectively are likely to contain SINEs and tRNA-related
sequences that were misclassified as tRNA genes by
tRNAscan-SE. To address this problem, we used RepeatMasker to identity repetitive elements.

genomic contigs, RepeatMasker annotated 212,419 as
repetitive elements corresponding to 96.1% of the predictions (Table 1). After the initial RepeatMasker filter, tRNA
genes in the glutamic acid, glycine and lysine amino acid
families were still represented in large numbers with
1346, 308 and 207 copies respectively (Table 1). Similar
observations of disproportionate increases in tRNA gene
copy numbers of certain tRNA families can also be
observed in the dog genome http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/
GtRNAdb/. We used a comparative genomics approach to
further distinguish between functional tRNA genes and
tRNA-related sequences.

Identification of repetitive elements
Following the tRNAscan-SE analysis, RepeatMasker identified the majority of tRNA gene predictions to be repetitive elements (Table 1). Of the total 31,868 putative tRNA
genes for the 20 standard amino acid families on both
assembled chromosomes and unordered genomic contigs, RepeatMasker annotated 28,830 as repetitive elements, removing 90.5% of the putative tRNA genes (Table
1). Similarly, of the total 221,051 predicted tRNA genes
on both assembled chromosomes and unordered

Defining a set of highly conserved vertebrate tRNA genes
Sequences with functional activity are subject to selective
pressures that prevent the fixation of mutations that
would compromise functionality. In contrast, most repetitive elements have lost their functional activity and
evolve neutrally by accumulating random mutations,
which results in much weaker evolutionary conservation
in these sequences [20]. By comparing tRNA gene sets of
cow, horse, dog, human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, chicken
and fugu, we found many highly conserved tRNA genes

despite the evolutionary distances between the organisms.
We found a unique set of 22 putative tRNA gene
sequences that were completely identical in all of the
genomes analyzed. Many of these 22 unique tRNA
sequences were present in more than one copy in cow. In
total, this set consisted of a set of 150 tRNA genes from 16
amino acid families.
Most other cow tRNA genes have accumulated at least one
point mutation during the evolution of the vertebrates
(Figure 1), since a tRNA gene may accumulate mutations
while still retaining biological function. The 95%
sequence similarity threshold used to identify a true set of
cow tRNA genes corresponds to approximately 3 mismatches; this threshold also coincides with the end of the
linear growth in cumulative tRNA counts on the plot (Figure 1). Application of the 95% threshold value resulted in
the identification of the 403 different genes, represented
by 133 unique sequences that contain 41 tRNA isoacceptors (Table 2), capable of decoding 55 of the 61 sense
codons (Additional file 2) according to the wobble rules
proposed by Gutherie and Abelson [21], where the
codon's third position U and C are generally decoded by
a single tRNA species. To identify tRNAs decoding the 6
codons not included in the set of tRNAs identified using
the > = 95% sequence identity threshold, elongator
methionine tRNA(s) and tRNA(s) directing the insertion
of selenocysteine (Sec) we manually curated the relevant
subsets of the 3,038 putative tRNA genes. We found a further 23 unique tRNA sequences encoded by 36 genes
(Additional file 1). As a result, we provide a set of 439 cow
tRNA genes represented by 156 unique tRNA genes capable of decoding all of the 61 sense codons (Additional file
3). Overall, the distribution of these 439 cow tRNA genes
across the anticodons follows a similar trend as in the
other vertebrate genomes (Figure 2).

Cluster analysis of 158 unique tRNA genes
The set of 158 unique tRNA gene sequences was examined
using cluster analysis. tRNA genes that carry the same
amino acid generally formed clusters with ≥ 0.95 posterior probability (PP) (Figure 3). This observation concurs
with the general consensus suggesting that tRNA genes
that belong to the same amino acid family have evolved
from a common tRNA. However not all tRNA genes in the
same amino acid family formed clusters with a high PP
value. tRNA genes from the serine, glutamatic acid, glycine, initiator methionine, threonine and arginine tRNA
families could not be resolved to a single cluster. Interestingly, the tRNA gene sequence for tryptophan lay within a
family of arginine specific tRNA genes, supported by a PP
value of 1. While not all tRNA genes from the same amino
acid family formed single clusters, most tRNA genes with
the same anticodon clustered together. There were three

(Figure 3, Additional file 4, Additional file 5). This observation suggests that these tRNA genes may have different
evolutionary histories. The multiple sequence alignment
of glycine tRNA genes showed that the BoxB site is identical in all glycine tRNA genes, point mutations were
observed at other sites (Additional file 6). A cluster analysis of unique tRNA-Gly genes revealed two distinct tRNAGlyCCC subfamilies (Figure 4). The first subfamily of
tRNA-GlyCCC differs from the second subfamily of tRNAGlyCCC that is closely related to the tRNA-GlyGCC genes.
Predicted secondary structures of these two tRNA-GlyCCC
genes illustrate various differences throughout the structure (Figure 5). We analyzed the distribution of these two
families of tRNA-GlyCCC genes among different genomes
and find that the subfamily 1 tRNA-GlyCCC genes are
highly conserved among human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat,
horse, dog, opossum, chicken, and fugu and usually
present in two gene copies. However, only one member of
this subfamily was observed in cow and no members of
this subfamily were identified in the current assembly of
the platypus genome (data not shown). In contrast, subfamily 2 tRNA-GlyCCC genes appear to be only present in
the mammals as no orthologs were detectable in the current assemblies of the chicken, lizard and fugu genomes.
Phylogenetic profiles of putative cow tRNA genes
We created phylogenetic profiles of cow tRNA genes to
identify the presence or absence of tRNA gene homologs
in other genomes. We compared the cow tRNA gene repertoire to a representative set of genomes from mammals
(horse, dog, mouse, rat, opossum, platypus, human and
chimpanzee), fish (medaka, stickleback, fugu, tetraodon,
zebrafish, and lamprey), reptile (green anole lizard), bird
(chicken) and invertebrates (purple sea urchin, honey
bee, lamprey, and lancelet). To be comprehensive we used
the set of 31,868 cow putative tRNA genes identified using
tRNAscan-SE and another 328,857 putative tRNA genes
from the other 20 genomes (Additional file 7). Of the
total cow tRNA genes, 533 tRNA genes (232 unique
sequences) had at least one match at ≥ 95% outside the
cow genome (Figure 6). The most common phylogenetic
profile identifies cow tRNA gene orthologs only among
vertebrate genomes (Additional file 8).

Additionally, more cow tRNA orthologs are identified
among genomes that are less phylogenetically diverged.
Using ≥ 95% sequence similarity threshold we identified,
between 446 and 494 tRNA genes among mammalian
genomes, 435 and 445 tRNA genes in chicken and lizard
respectively and a range of 405 – 449 tRNA genes among
fishes (Additional file 8) comparing the total of 31,868
putative cow tRNA genes. In contrast, only 103 – 155 cow
tRNA genes were identified among invertebrate genomes
using the same threshold (Additional file 8).

from other genes with the same anticodon.

Distribution of tRNA genes in the cow genome
tRNA genes generally occur in clusters, some of which
contain large numbers of genes. The cow genome contains
a number of such large clusters, in particular on chromosomes 3, 12, 19 and 23 (Figure 7). The organisation of the
genes in these clusters is generally very similar to the
equivalent clusters in the human genome (data not
shown).

Discussion
We performed a genome-wide analysis of the tRNA gene
repertoire of the Bos taurus genome. Although our analyses were complicated by the wide spread distribution of
SINEs, we were able to identify a representative set of
tRNA genes in the cow. The impact of SINEs on tRNA gene

genome contains over 175,000 tRNA genes and pseudogenes [17]. In dog, 401 tRNA-LysCTT genes were predicted,
many of which are false positives due to a family of SINEs
specific among carnivore genomes that have evolved from
a tRNA-LysCTT [22].

Posterior probabilities (PP) values are associated with each

For the accurate identification of tRNA genes in the mouse
genome, putative mouse tRNA genes predicted by tRNAscan-SE were analyzed using RepeatMasker to remove
tRNA-related SINEs and then cross-validated by identifying orthologous mouse-human tRNA genes [16]. We
adopted a similar strategy for the annotation of cow tRNA
genes except that we compared our putative tRNA genes to
a larger set of genomes. While our RepeatMasker analysis
was able to filter out a large number of false positives
(~96% of total tRNA gene predictions), the remaining set
of tRNA genes was still relatively large when compared to
numbers observed in other vertebrate genomes. The
majority of putative tRNA genes not identified as repetitive elements were derived from three amino acid families, glutamic acid, glycine and lysine suggesting that these
might originate from recent expansion of ruminant-specific tRNA-derived repeat families. In fact the family of
tRNA-derived SINEs present among ruminants that was
created from a tRNA-Glu [23], may account for many misannotated tRNA genes in the glutamic acid family. These
SINEs have maintained a high level of sequence similarity
to authentic tRNA genes and have tRNA-like predicted secondary structures (Additional file 9). Elevated numbers in
the glycine and lysine amino acid families are probably
due to point mutations in the anticodon region of the
tRNA-related sequence of this tRNA-Glu SINE, leading to

The distribution of annotated tRNA genes in the cow genome

The distribution of annotated tRNA genes in the cow genome. Each vertical bar represents a single gene. The number
of tRNA genes assigned to each chromosome is indicated as in some regions the genes are located too close together to be

good reference as it lacks many of the repetitive elements
present in other vertebrate genomes [24]. While a number
of functional tRNA genes may be filtered out due to the
accumulation of mutations in neutral sites, we wanted to
define a confident set of cow tRNA genes. With a 95%
similarity threshold we identified 406 different tRNA
genes with 41 distinct anticodons, encoding 135 tRNAs
with unique sequences. However, this set of 405 tRNA
genes was only capable of reading 55 of the 61 codons.
We manually added the respective tRNA genes for the
missing codons, which included 36 additional sequences.
Many of these excluded tRNA genes were longer than the
average 73 bp, due to the presence of a variable arm in the
tRNA and as such lowered the sequence similarity score to
less than 95%. We performed a cluster analysis of these
cow tRNA genes and explored the relationships between
the tRNA genes to understand more about tRNA gene evo-

lution in the cow. From our analysis, tRNA genes with the
same anticodon generally formed single clades with high
posterior probability support. One exception that we
investigated in more detail was tRNA genes from the glycine family. The vertebrates contain three distinct but
related families of tRNA-Gly genes, with TCC, GCC and
CCC anticodons. However, in mammals an additional
family of tRNA-GlyCCC genes is present (subfamily 2). This
observed tRNA-GlyCCC appears to have arisen in the ancestor of the eutherian mammals and marsupials by a mutation in the anticodon of a member of the tRNA-GlyGCC
family, as this new family was not identified among the
non-mammalian genomes we investigated (Additional
file 10). For the other more conserved subfamily 1 tRNAGlyCCC genes it is not clear whether the apparent absence
of orthologs of this gene in the current platypus genome
assembly is due to the incomplete nature of the assembly,

or to loss of the genes in platypus, similarly for the identification of only one member of the family in the cow
genome. Due to the redundancy of function, and the distinctive sequence differences between the two tRNA-GlyCCC families it will be interesting to uncover the expression
patterns of tRNA genes from the glycine family.
While we were able to gain an overview of tRNA genes
within the cow genome, we wanted to trace the evolutionary history of cow tRNA genes across various organisms.
We used phylogenetic profiles as a method to describe the
conservation patterns of cow tRNA genes across 20 species. Generally, genomes that were phylogenetically more
related to the cow genome contained a higher number of
tRNA orthologs. However there was a large distinction in
the number of tRNA orthologs (defined as sequences with
≥ 95% sequence identity) between vertebrate and invertebrate genomes. The number of cow tRNA orthologs
among vertebrates is 2–3 folds larger than the number
among invertebrates. Expansion of vertebrate genomes
resulting in emergence of paralogous copies of tRNA
genes may explain the larger numbers of tRNA orthologs
observed in vertebrates. This is in line with the observation that the number of tRNA genes in a genome is positively correlated to the genome size [25]. However, due to
the large evolutionary distance between cow and invertebrates, tRNA orthologs in invertebrates may have been
omitted due to the stringency of our similarity threshold.
The phylogenetic profiles also revealed a dispersed distribution of cow tRNA orthologs. Whilst roughly half of the
cow tRNA orthologs are highly conserved and present in
all vertebrate genomes the other half display a much more
random distribution. This observation is in agreement
with the hypothesis of a core and peripheral set of tRNA
genes [26]. The authors suggest that tRNA gene evolution
may be a repetitive process, which would explain the distribution of cow tRNA genes observed in our phylogenetic
profiles.

Conclusion
We have identified a set of highly conserved tRNA genes
among vertebrate genomes as part of our analysis of the B.
taurus genome. Our analyses revealed that while most
tRNA isoacceptors seem to have evolved from a common
ancestor, some may have different evolutionary histories.
Our additional analysis of the glycine tRNA genes
revealed two distinct families of tRNA-GlyCCC genes, one
of which seems to have been formed via a point mutation
in the anticodon of a member of the tRNA-GlyGCC family
just prior to the radiation of mammals. Finally, our phylogenetic profiles of cow tRNA genes shows a large core set
of tRNA genes conserved among vertebrate genomes,
which highlights the importance of vertebrate genome
expansion in relation to tRNA gene sets in genomes.

Methods
Sources of sequences
Human (Homo sapiens), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), dog
(Canis familiaris), mouse (Mus musculus), rat (Rattus norvegicus), chicken (Gallus gallus), and fugu (Takifugu
rubripes) tRNA gene sequences predicted by tRNAscan-SE
and their respective tRNAscan-SE output files were downloaded from the genomic tRNA database [27] on the 11th
January 2008. The cow (B. taurus) (August 2006), horse
(Equus caballus, January 2007), opossum (Monodelphis
domestica, January 2006), platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus, March 2007), green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis,
February 2007), medaka (Oryzias latipes, April 2006),
stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus, February 2006), tetraodon (Tetraodon nigroviridis, February 2004), zebrafish
(Danio rerio, July 2007) and honey bee (Apis mellifera, January 2005) genome assemblies and sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, September 2006) scaffolds were
downloaded as unmasked fasta files from the UCSC
genome browser [28,29] The lamprey (Petromyzon marinus, March 2007) contigs, Pacific sea squirt (Ciona
savignyi, July 2005) reftigs and lancelet (Branchiostoma floridae, March 2006) scaffolds were downloaded as
unmasked fasta files from the UCSC test genome browser
[30].
De novo prediction of tRNA genes and identification of
tRNA-derived repetitive elements
To identify putative tRNA genes in our downloaded
sequences, we used tRNAscan-SE v. 1.23 with settings calibrated for eukaryotic genomes [15]. Fasta files of predicted tRNA genes were generated from the tRNAscan-SE
output using in-house Perl scripts. For our tRNA analysis
of the cow genome, pseudogenes were excluded from further analyses. To avoid potential redundancy of cow
genome sequence data, tRNA gene predictions located on
unordered genomic contigs (chrUn) were analyzed separately. To remove repetitive elements in the initial set of
cow tRNA gene predictions, RepeatMasker (version open3.1.8) [18] was used running with the following parameters: "-e cross_match", "-slow" and "-species cow". Consensus profiles for genomic repeat elements were
obtained from RepBase 12.12 [31].
Identifying functional cow tRNA genes using comparative
genomics
We compared putative cow tRNA genes to pre-computed
and annotated sets of tRNA genes from the human, chimpanzee, horse, dog, rat, mouse, chicken, and fugu
genomes using the BLASTn program (version 2.2.17) [32]
running on default settings. We used a 95% sequence similarity threshold as a filter for functional cow tRNA genes.
Intronic sequences as predicted by tRNAscan-SE were
removed from all tRNA genes before measuring similarity.

Page 10 of 13

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:188

Sequence similarity was calculated across the full length
gapped pairwise alignment from the BLAST output, where
a gap opening or base substitution counted as a mismatch. Finally, we identified a set of cow tRNA genes that
were conserved with ≥ 95% sequence identity across all 8
genomes.
Determination of phylogenetic profiles for cow tRNA
genes using sequence homology
Phylogenetic profiles describe the presence-absence of
homologous genes in genomes [33]. We constructed phylogenetic profiles for our set of 31,868 putative cow tRNA
genes across a wide spectrum of genomes that included
the dog, opossum, platypus chimpanzee, fugu, chicken,
human, rat, mouse, horse, lizard, medaka, stickleback,
tetraodon, zebrafish, lamprey, sea squirt, lancelet, sea
urchin and honey bee. We used the BLASTn program running on default settings to compare all cow putative tRNA
genes predicted using tRNAscan-SE to all sets of putative
tRNA genes predicted from the respective genomes using
tRNA scan-SE. Intronic sequences were not removed, as
these sites are phylogenetically informative. tRNA genes
with 95% or higher sequence similarity (calculated as
above) were considered as orthologs. The phylogenetic
profile of each cow tRNA gene is represented by a string of
binary numbers 21 bits long, which corresponds to the
number of genomes. The presence of an ortholog in
another genome is represented as a 1 and the absence as a
0. Each position of a string corresponds to a respective
genome. The positioning of each genome in each phylogenetic profile was arranged by the phylogenetic distance
of the respective genome from cow as defined by NCBI
taxonomy [34,35] i.e. the last vector of the phylogenetic
profile is the most divergent genome from cow.
Analysing the distribution of cow tRNA gene families
We inferred cluster relationships of all cow tRNA genes
with orthologs in human, chimpanzee, horse, dog,
mouse, rat, chicken and fugu. We aligned all unique tRNA
sequences using T-Coffee [36] running on default parameters. Bayesian trees were constructed using MrBayes software v. 3.1.2 [37]. We used the recommended settings for
Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of tRNA sequences, using
a gamma distribution with four rate categories [38]. The
General Time Reversible (GTR) model [39] was used for
1,000,000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs
with a sampling frequency of 10,000. A burnin corresponding to 25% of the samples was used. Posterior probabilities (PP) values were assigned to every possible
grouping of taxa in proportion to the number of times it
is sampled. The number of times a tree is sampled is
dependent on the likelihood of the tree, thus the PP value
of a particular arrangement can be an estimate of confi-

dence in that arrangement. The phylogenetic tree files
were visualized and prepared using TreeView [40].
