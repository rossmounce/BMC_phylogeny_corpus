Abstract
Background: The swine influenza (SI) is an infectious disease of swine and human. The novel swine-origin
influenza A (H1N1) that emerged from April 2009 in Mexico spread rapidly and caused a human pandemic
globally. To determine whether the tremendous virus had existed in or transmitted to pigs in southern China,
eight H1N1 influenza strains were identified from pigs of Guangdong province during 2008-2009.
Results: Based on the homology and phylogenetic analyses of the nucleotide sequences of each gene segments,
the isolates were confirmed to belong to the classical SI group, with HA, NP and NS most similar to 2009 humanlike H1N1 influenza virus lineages. All of the eight strains were low pathogenic influenza viruses, had the same host
range, and not sensitive to class of antiviral drugs.
Conclusions: This study provides the evidence that there is no 2009 H1N1-like virus emerged in southern China,
but the importance of swine influenza virus surveillance in China should be given a high priority.

Background
Swine influenza (SI) is an acute respiratory disease
caused by influenza A virus, a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family. Influenza A viruses have been isolated
from a number of animals including humans, birds,
dogs, seals, horses and swine [1]. The causative agent is
RNA virus with a segmented genome comprised of
eight negative-sense, single-stranded RNA segments
encoding eleven proteins [2].
Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are two
major surface glycoproteins of influenza viruses and
important for host range, antigenicity, pathogenesis and
diagnostic detection. Influenza A viruses are classified
into a number of subtypes based on antigenic differences in haemagglutinin (HA; 16 subtypes) and neuraminidase (NA; 9 subtypes) [3,1]. Although other
subtypes have been sporadically identified, there are
three major subtypes of SIV (H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2)

circulating in the swine population throughout the
world currently [4,5].
Pigs have the susceptibility of infecting avian and
human influenza, for the cells respiratory tract express
both sialic acid-a2,3-galactose (SAa2,3Gal) receptors and
sialic acid-a2,6-galactose (SAa2,6Gal) receptors, preferred by avian influenza viruses and human influenza
viruses, respectively [6,7]. Therefore, pigs play an important role in supporting co-infection, replication, and
reassortment among human, avian, and swine influenza
viruses, acting as an intermediate host or mixing vessels
thereby creating novel reassortant viruses with pandemic
potential [4,6,8].
Since Influenza was first described as a disease of swine
in 1918, the viruses had continued to cause diseases in
populations of pigs worldwide [9]. Much like human
influenza [10], SIVs have been shown to be evolving by
both antigenic drift and frequent reassortment [11,12].
Although infection of humans with swine influenza is a
relatively uncommon occurrence, H1N1 and H3N2 of
swine origin have been reported previously in North
America, Europe and Asia, and have caused sporadic
human infections over the past decades [13-18].

As one of the mainly representative subtypes, swine
H1N1 influenza viruses have been reported widely
throughout the world. The world-wide H1N1 pandemic
in1918 also affected swine, and another classical swine
H1N1 virus strain caused the well-known outbreak at
Ft. Dix in New Jersey in 1976 [19]. In March and early
April 2009, a new swine-origin influenza A (H1N1)
Virus (S-OIV) emerged in Mexico and the United
States, had developed into the first pandemic of the 21st
century [20,21]. China is generally regarded as an epicenter of pandemic influenza viruses throughout history.
In 2009 pandemic, 71 of the first 426 imported cases
with confirmed cases of infection were from Guangdong
province which was one of the most severely disaster
area in China. It is documented that SIVs have become
more human-like as well as more avian-like, the probability of generating human-adaptive viruses increase.
Co-infections have allowed intermixing of these genomes to produce triple reassortants with genes derived
from human, swine and avian influenza strains [22].
For a better understanding the influenza A virus
lineages and evolution influenced by the 2009 H1N1,
the study were focused on H1N1 SIVs in Guangdong
province from 2008 to 2009. The whole genome
sequence of each strain were analyzed, intending to
learn more epidemiology information about the prevalence of SIVs, the possible correlations with the 2009
H1N1 strains in southern China, and provide useful
guides for SI control.

Results
Virus isolation and identification

According to the detection results, eight isolates were
positive for HA tests, subtyped to be H1N1 by RT-PCR
assays. The eight H1N1 isolates obtained in this study
were listed in Table 1.
Sequence identity analysis

The nucleotide sequence identities among the eight
genes of each isolate were 99-100%, suggesting that the
eight isolates might evolve from the same progenitor

viruses. The genotypes and genetic origins of isolates
were initially inferred from BLAST analysis and pairwise
comparisons of each gene segment to the corresponding
sequences of reference viruses. Taking into account the
high levels of sequence identity between the eight isolates, isolate A/swine/Guangdong/11/2009 was used as
the representative strain for blast search in the Genbank.
Each of the eight genes of the eight isolates showed the
highest nucleotide sequence identities to those of classical swine H1N1 virus, with homologies ranging from
98.8 to 99.6%.
Phylogenetic relationship and distribution

To characterize the gene segments of the isolated
viruses more precisely, the phylogenetic trees using the
nucleotide sequences of eight genes were constructed
with genes available in GenBank respectively. Three
lineages correlative with 2009 human strains, classical
swine strains and European swine strains were observed
in the phylogenetic trees (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 & 8).
All the eight genes of the eight isolates, belonged to the
same sublineage closely related to the classical swine
H1N1 viruses, especially those isolated in China. The
phylogenetic trees revealed that the HA, NP and NS
segments of the isolated strains with the 2009 H1N1
strains were listed in the sister lineages of classical SIV
(Figures 1, 3, 4), while the PB1, PB2, PA, NA and M
genes of the eight genes were closed to the European
H1N1 SIV (Figures 2, 5, 6, 7, 8). Meanwhile, two H3N2
viruses were also closely relative to the classical swine
lineage of PA, M and NS, suggested the reassortment
with the classical swine H1N1 viruses (Figures 4, 7, 8).
Key site analyses

The deduced amino acid sequences of the segemented
genes were aligned and compared with the reference
H1N1 strains. These isolates contained an amino acid
motif PSIQSR↓G at the HA cleavage sites, which met
the characteristic of low pathogenic influenza viruses.
The predicted antigenic epitopes of the HA protein of
the isolates were similar to the classical H1N1 SIVs,

revealed five major changes located at the position 36,
120, 138, 170 and 278 between different lineages (Figure
9). The specific mutation was located at the position 36
between the isolated strains and the 2009 H1N1 strains,
and the mutation located 138 compared to the avian
like strains. In the study, all of the isolates displayed the
mutations located at 120 and 170 between all of the
avian like, 2009 H1N1-like and the classical H1N1
strains, but shared the same antigenic epitope at 278
with 2009 H1N1-like strains only.
The eight isolates maintained amino acids typical of
swine viruses at residues 68E, 134A, 183P, 187D, 191L
and 222G (according to H1 number) of HA genes,
which were previously defined receptor-binding sites
[23,24]. Only the European swine strains possessed D at
position 68, A/swine/Zhejiang/1/2007/H1N1 possessed
V at position 134, all the strains in this study possessed
P at position 183, the 2009 H1N1 strains possessed S at
position 183. The eight strains shared the same amino
acid at the receptor-binding sites, which suggests that

these isolates might have the same host range. As amino
acid position 222 is in the receptor binding cavity,
changes can potentially influence receptor binding of
the influenza virus as well. In this study, the eight isolated strains, classical strains and a European strain possessed G at the position 222. The 2009 H1N1 strains
possessed D, while the other European swine strains
possessed E at the position 222.
The N-linked glycosylation sites are relatively conserved, and the number of potential glycosylation site
(PGS) changes may influence the protein folding, oligomerization, quality control, sorting and transport [25].
Six potential glycosylation sites (PGSs) with an N-X-T/S
motif (where X can be any amino acid except proline)
were conserved at positions 10, 11, 23, 87, 276, and 287
in the HA1 and two were conserved at positions 154,
213 in the HA2 protein of A/Swine/Guangdong/11/
2009. The isolated strains, 2009 H1N1 strains and the
strains from Shanghai, Maryland and Kentucky of Classical swine had the same PGSs. The Wisconsin and

Tennessee of Classical swine strains as the avian-like
strains did not have the potential glycosylation sites at
the 276 position.
A balance between the activities of HA in virus attachment and NA in virus release needs to be maintained
for optimal viral replication [1]. No amino acid substitutions (H274Y and N294S) conferring resistance to oseltamivir were observed at the conserved residues in the
NA proteins of the eight isolates, which suggest that
they are sensitive to NA inhibitors. Eight PGSs in NA
protein were found in the isolated strains and 2009
H1N1 strains, located at positions 44,58,63,68,
88,146,235 and 386 in linker region and the NA domain.
The eight isolates shared the same PGSs distributions
with the 2009 H1N1 strains, had two extra PGSs at the
position 386 compared to the Wisconsin and Tennessee
of Classical swine strains. The avian like H1N1 (A/
swine/England/WVL7/1992/H1N1) carried different
eight PGSs located amino acid positions 36, 44, 49, 54,
74, 132, 221 and 372 in the NA molecule.
Pathogenicity of influenza virus was polygenic. Internal proteins (M, PB1, PB2 and NS) also harbor

determinants for host range and virulence, as demonstrated by genetic studies on avian-human reassortant
viruses [26]. Anti-influenza drugs amantadine and
rimantadine target the M2 protein, and the substitution
S31N have been reported to confer resistance to these
drugs in recent European swine viruses, including
H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 viruses [27]. Interestingly, the
strains of same lineage had difference at the position of
31. The substitution S31N observed in the M2 protein
genes of our isolates suggested not sensitive to the primary class of antiviral drugs.
PB1-F2 has been shown to localize to the mitochondria and induce apoptosis, enhance viral virulence in a
mouse model [28,29]. Similar to most classical swine
H1N1 viruses, the eight isolates contained truncated
PB1-F2 proteins because of in-frame stop codon after
residue 11. The highly conserved regions in the PB1
protein that may be functionally important and the
amino acid residues at 375 might be critical for host
specificity of the protein. Some difference appeared at
the position of 375 between different strains. All of the
eight isolates, 2009 H1N1 strains and Shanghai,

isolated strains). The mutated sites were pointed with the arrow.

Maryland strains possessed S at position 375, European
swine strains were D or N, but other classical strains
were G.
Previous study showed that residue 627 of the polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) was associated with host
range adaptation and recognized as one of the most
important determinants [30-33]. In this study, each of
the eight isolates possessed a K at position 627 of PB2
which was characteristic of mammalian influenza
viruses, the classical swine strains possessed a K at position 627 of PB2, and the 2009 Human strains and
avian-like strains were E.
The NS1 protein is also important in determining
the pathogenicity of influenza A virus in different
hosts. No deletions were observed at positions 80-84
of NS1 proteins in the isolates. All eight isolates possessed D rather than E at position 92 of NS1, which
possesed a mutation might increase the virulence of
H5N1 viruses in pigs. The exceptional A/swine/England/WVL7/1992/H1N1 (avian like H1N1) possessed T
at position 92 of NS1.

Discussion
Influenza virus infection is an important cause of
respiratory disease among pigs throughout the swine
producing regions of the world [34]. Pigs have been
considered as mixing vessel for human and avian influenza viruses, allowing swine viruses to acquire avian and
human virus gene segments to generate novel SIVs. In
China, various subtypes of SIVs were present in pig
populations. Four subtypes (H1N1, H1N2, H3N1, and
H3N2) were circulating in pig populations, and the classical swine H1N1 viruses were the predominant influenza virus infecting and circulating in swine population
[35]. In southern China, reassortment of classical swine
H1N1 and human-like H3N2 viruses had been reported
from 1976 to 1982 [36-38] and avian-like swine H1N1
viruses co-circulated with classical swine H1N1 viruses
were also detected in pigs [39]. In last several years,
many studies reported the co-circulation and reassortment of classical swine H1N1, avian-like H1N1 viruses

and human-like H3N2 viruses in most area of China
[37,38]. Some serological surveillance had also indicated
that avian H4, H5 and H9 influenza viruses had been
transmitted to pig populations in southeastern China
[40,41].
Influenza virus genomes are well known to undergo
antigenic drift or antigenic shift that enable escape from
preexisting immunity and cause new outbreaks of influenza in animals and even humans [42-44]. In China,
pigs have a short lifespan (approximately 6 months) and
are not vaccinated with any type of swine influenza vaccine. Therefore, the viruses circulating in swine population might appear to have been under less immune
selection pressure and all genes evolved more slowly
than in humans and poultry [45]. The classical H1N1
remained highly conserved genetically until the 1990s,
with only a limited number of nucleotide changes
[46,47]. However, since the introduction of H3N2
viruses with genes of human and avian origin into pig
populations and the resultant reassortment with classical
H1N1 viruses, the dynamics of clinical disease and prevention of outbreaks has changed dramatically only
recently.
In the present study, the phylogenetic and molecular
property of the H1N1 SIV strains isolated at Guangdong
province in southern China through the 2009 pandemic
were described in detail. The whole genome sequences
were analyzed, and the genetic relatedness of these isolates with 2009 H1N1 viruses, classical SIV and European
SIV were studied. Based on the phylogenetic trees and
homology of the nucleotide sequence of gene segments,
the isolates were confirmed to be the classical swine
virus. The nucleotide sequence identities among the eight
genes were 99%-100%, indicated that the classical SIV
H1N1 circulating in Guangdong of Southern China were
resistant and might derive from the same ancestor. Interestingly, PA, M, and NS genes of two H3N2 strains from
Guangdong province were located in similar lineages of
the strains in the study, indicated the reassortment had
occurred in classical H1N1 viruses. The isolated strains
contained genes from the neighboring lineages with 2009

Liu et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:129
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/129

H1N1 which genetically distant from the avian-like clusters, provided further evidences that isolates in the study
and the 2009 H1N1 viruses might be related with a finite
extent.
Some key amino acids of the segmented gene have
been implicated to play the vital role in host range adaptation, pathogenicity of influenza A virus in different
hosts, receptor binding and antiviral drug resistance,
and these traits are polygenic. Based on whole genome
sequence analysis, the characteristics of each isolated
strain were deeply and profoundly studied, revealed
some resemblance and difference between different
lineages. Generally, low pathogenic influenza viruses
raise lowly concerning made these strains might have a
greater opportunity to become widespread. The isolated
strains had the same S at position 375 of PB1, as 2009
human strains, suggested that these strains should be
raised more concern for the potentiality to infect
human. It should be further studied to determine
whether the PGSs changed in glucoprotein of the virion
surface could alter the pathogenicity. Compared to the
avian-like strains, the extra PGSs in HA protein at the
276 position supposed to enhance the pathogenicity for
wide prevalence, and the additional PGSs in NA protein
might reduce the ability of affinity between influenza
virus and the host receptor as well as the release of the
virus particles.
The special environment and lifestyle in southern
China provide more chances for wild aquatic birds,
domestic poultry, pigs and humans to contact closely,
and create the opportunity for interspecies transmission
and generation of new reassortment influenza viruses.
Although the 2009 H1N1 has not been identified circulating endemically in swine, it is virtually impossible to
prevent new outbreaks of influenza in human and animals. It had been recognized that influenza viruses in
pigs may form the basis for newly emerging influenza
pandemic after further adaptation to the human host or
reassortment with other influenza A viruses. Therefore,
carrying out swine influenza virus surveillance would be
of great significance.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated that
the circulating SIV strains in commercial farms in southern China are mainly classical swine H1N1. In spite of
the low pathogenicity, the strains in the study might have
limit evolutionary correlations with the 2009 H1N1
viruses, but also provides the evidence that pigs served as
reservoirs of ancestor influenza viruses for emergence of
pandemic strains. We hope this study could provide
some useful information for the prediction and preparedness of possibly future influenza pandemics.

Materials and methods
Viruses

Nasal swabs were collected from diseased swine in different pig farms from Guangdong province of southern
China. Initial isolation was performed in10-day-old specific-pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs. The
Allantoic fluids were harvested after 3-4 days of incubation, and primarily diagnosed by HA test. The viruses
were further confirmed and subtyped by 2 different
multiplex RT-PCR as previously described. The remains
were preserved at -70°C for the subsequent trials.
RNA extraction and gene sequence

RNA was extracted from allantoic fluids using the
QIAamp viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia,
CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
full length of all eight genes (HA, NA, PA, PB1, PB2,
NP, NS, M) of each isolates were amplified by RT-PCR
using universal primer sets [48,49]. Reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out by
PrimeScriptTM One-Step RT-PCR Kit (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, China) in 25 μl reaction volume
containing 20 μl of RT-PCR PreMix (reaction buffer,
dNTPs, 2 μl of enzyme mix), 2 μl of extracted viral
RNA and the specific primer pair. The PCR products
were cloned into pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, China) for later sequencing (AuGCT Biotechnology, Beijing, China).
Sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis

Sequences were assembled using the Lasergene Seqman package IV (DNAStar 6.0) and aligned using multiple sequence alignment tool CLUSTAL W 1.83. The
phylogenetic trees were constructed using the MEGA
4.1 software with neighbor-joining method [50] and
each tree was produced using a consensus of 1000
bootstrap replicates. All the other H1N1 viral
sequences of eight genes for reference were from the
GenBank database.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

The segmented sequences determined in this study were
available from GenBank database and the corresponding
accession numbers were listed in Table 1.
Antigenicity and surface probability analysis

DNA Star software was used to analyze the antigenicity
epitopes of the HA proteins of each isolates, using Jameson-Wolf methods (DNAStar Inc., Madison, WI, USA).
Mature peptide sequences of HA and NA genes of the
H1N1 SIV strains were submitted for prediction of
potential N-glycosylation sites using the CBS on-line
server 1.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/).
