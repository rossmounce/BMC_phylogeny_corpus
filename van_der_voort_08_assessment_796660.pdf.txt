Abstract
Background: The catabolite control protein CcpA is a transcriptional regulator conserved in
many Gram-positives, controlling the efficiency of glucose metabolism. Here we studied the role
of Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 CcpA in regulation of metabolic pathways and expression of
enterotoxin genes by comparative transcriptome analysis of the wild-type and a ccpA-deletion
strain.
Results: Comparative analysis revealed the growth performance and glucose consumption rates
to be lower in the B. cereus ATCC 14579 ccpA deletion strain than in the wild-type. In exponentially
grown cells, the expression of glycolytic genes, including a non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase that mediates conversion of D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 3phospho-D-glycerate in one single step, was down-regulated and expression of gluconeogenic
genes and genes encoding the citric acid cycle was up-regulated in the B. cereus ccpA deletion strain.
Furthermore, putative CRE-sites, that act as binding sites for CcpA, were identified to be present
for these genes. These results indicate CcpA to be involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism,
thereby optimizing the efficiency of glucose catabolism. Other genes of which the expression was
affected by ccpA deletion and for which putative CRE-sites could be identified, included genes with
an annotated function in the catabolism of ribose, histidine and possibly fucose/arabinose and
aspartate. Notably, expression of the operons encoding non-hemolytic enterotoxin (Nhe) and
hemolytic enterotoxin (Hbl) was affected by ccpA deletion, and putative CRE-sites were identified,
which suggests catabolite repression of the enterotoxin operons to be CcpA-dependent.
Conclusion: The catabolite control protein CcpA in B. cereus ATCC 14579 is involved in
optimizing the catabolism of glucose with concomitant repression of gluconeogenesis and
alternative metabolic pathways. Furthermore, the results point to metabolic control of enterotoxin
gene expression and suggest that CcpA-mediated glucose sensing provides an additional mode of
control in moderating the expression of the nhe and hbl operons in B. cereus ATCC 14579.

Bacillus cereus is an important Gram-positive, spore-forming food-borne pathogen. Many strains cause either an
emetic or a diarrhoeal type of disease. The production of
emetic toxin in foods, also referred to as cereulide, may
cause nausea and vomiting. The diarrhoeal type of disease
is associated with the production of enterotoxins in the
intestines and may involve Nhe, Hbl and CytK [1-3].
Food-borne disease caused by B. cereus is generally characterized by mild symptoms. However, recently more severe
cases with a lethal outcome have been described [4,5]. B.
cereus can also be the causative agent of other diseases,
such as periodontitis, fulminant endophthalmitis, and
meningitis in immuno-compromised patients [1,6-8]. B.
cereus is ubiquitously found in the environment, including in soil. Therefore, the transfer to food is not surprising
and causes many problems [1]. In nutrient-rich environments, such as food, B. cereus shows low generation times
putatively gaining advantage from its capacity to use various carbohydrates and proteinaceous substrates [9]. The
regulation of gene expression plays an important role in
the efficient selection of the preferred carbon and energy
source for growth. Annotation of the genome of B. cereus
ATCC 14579 predicted the regulation of gene expression
to be highly complex involving over two hundred transcriptional regulators managing its 5370 open reading
frames (ORFs) [9,10]. One of these putative regulators is
the catabolite control protein CcpA, which is a member of
the LacI-family of transcriptional regulators. CcpA and the
regulatory mechanism of the catabolite repression are
highly conserved in low-GC Gram-positives [11]. B. cereus
ATCC 14579 CcpA shows 77% identity with B. subtilis
CcpA. Furthermore, CcpA in B. subtilis has been shown to
have a role in optimizing glucose metabolism and the
underlying regulatory mechanisms have recently been
reviewed [12-14]. Regulation of gene expression by CcpA
is mediated by its binding to DNA at a specific cis-binding
sequence, the Catabolite Responsive Element (CRE) [1416].
In recent years the regulon of B. subtilis CcpA has been
studied extensively by transcriptome analyses, revealing
genes and operons under direct and indirect control of
CcpA [17-20]. Furthermore, Moreno et al. [21] showed a
clear correlation between the glucose-repressed genes and
the presence of predicted CRE-sites. Moreover, they
showed CcpA-mediated glucose-independent regulation
of expression [21]. Other organisms for which the role of
CcpA in carbon metabolism was established are Lactobacillus acidophilus [22] and Lactococcus lactis [23]. Recently,
a role for CcpA in the control of virulence of Staphylococcus
aureus [24], Streptococcus pneumoniae [25], and Clostridium
perfringens was reported [26] and reviewed [27].

Notably, comparative genomics of the different species of
the B. cereus group revealed reduced capacity to metabolize carbohydrates and increased potential for protein
metabolism as compared to B. subtilis [28,29]. Here we
report on the role of CcpA in regulation of metabolism
and virulence in B. cereus ATCC 14579.

Results and Discussion
Growth and glucose utilization of the ccpA deletion strain
compared to the wild-type
Growth of the wild-type and the ccpA deletion strain was
assessed under aerobic conditions in BHI containing 2 g/
L D-glucose, and revealed specific growth rates (μ) of
0.024 and 0.022 (h-1), respectively (Fig. 1). Statistical
analysis showed the growth rates of the wild-type and
deletion strain to be significantly different. Assessment of
glucose concentrations at different time points during
growth revealed a reduction in the glucose consumption
rate for the ccpA deletion strain compared to that of the
wild-type (Fig. 1). The glucose concentration at earlyexponential growth for both the wild-type and the ccpA
deletion strain was around 1.2 g/L, and glucose was still
available in the mid-exponential growth phase. Notably,
glucose was depleted in the wild-type culture upon entry
into the transition phase, whereas glucose depletion in
the ccpA deletion strain culture was only observed in the
stationary phase of growth.

Overview of the transcriptome data
Analyses of the transcriptome data of the ccpA deletion
strain compared to the wild-type in samples taken at the
four time points indicated in figure 1, showed expression
of a large number of ORFs to be affected upon ccpA deletion. Remarkably, the number of genes differentially
expressed increased from 147 at early exponential phase
to over 700 genes in the stationary phase (Fig. 2). The
large differences in gene expression in transition and stationary phase cells of the ccpA deletion strain compared to
that of the wild-type are conceivably affected by the
respective presence and absence of glucose. Furthermore,
these differences may point to the initiation of secondary
effects of the ccpA deletion in these growth phases on gene
expression and consequently cellular performance. Therefore, transcriptome analysis was focused on the early- and
mid-exponential phase samples where glucose is still
present at high levels in the cultures of both the ccpA deletion strain and the wild-type. In early-exponential phase,
103 genes showed higher expression and 44 genes
showed a lower expression in the ccpA deletion strain
compared to the wild-type. For mid-exponential phase
cells these numbers were 127 and 54, respectively. When
corrected for overlap between regulated genes in the earlyand mid-exponential phase, a total of 173 genes expres-

Identification of the B. cereus CRE-site consensus and in
silico analysis
Direct regulation exerted by CcpA is indicated by the presence of a CRE-site. By a series of subsequent alignments
searches, the B. cereus ATCC 14579 consensus CRE-site
was identified and visualized in Figure 3 (for details see
Methods). This showed the consensus sequence to consist
of only 16-bp for B. cereus ATCC 14579, WWGWAARCGWWWWCAW, whereas an 18-bp consensus sequence was
reported for B. subtilis, WWTGNAARCGNWWWCAWW,
[15]. Nevertheless, a high similarity between these consensus sequences exists. The B. cereus ATCC 14579
genome was scanned with the obtained CRE-site consensus (Fig. 3), identifying the putative CRE-sites (see Additional file 2). A number of 76 putative CRE-sites were
identified for 83 out of 173 genes that show a higher
expression in the ccpA deletion strain compared to the

tested genes showed the same trend in expression, with
differential expression only slightly more pronounced in
qPCR experiments, a feature observed before in such comparisons [30]. This indicates the microarray platform to be
suited for gene expression analysis (for qPCR data see

sion in the exponential phase was shown to be higher in
the ccpA deletion strain compared to the wild-type and for
80 genes expression in the ccpA deletion strain was
observed to be lower than in the wild-type (Fig. 2). Consequently, genes that show a higher expression in the ccpA
deletion strain are possibly repressed by CcpA, whereas
genes that show a lower expression in the ccpA deletion
strain may be activated by CcpA in the wild-type. The
number of genes putatively regulated are similar to those
described for CcpA-regulated genes in B. subtilis [1719,21].

wild-type in exponential phase cells, and these 83 genes
are part of 49 putative operons [9,31]. Furthermore, 21
putative CRE-sites were identified in the promoter region
of 18 out of 80 genes with a lower expression in the ccpA
deletion strain (see Additional file 2) in exponential phase
cells, these 18 genes are part of 17 putative operons [9,31].
These results are in agreement with the general observation that activation by CcpA occurs less frequently than
repression by CcpA [21]. For B. subtilis not all identified
putative CRE-sites could be shown to be functional [15]
and the predicted CRE-sites in B. cereus should therefore
be regarded putative.
Analysis of genes differentially expressed in the ccpA
deletion strain
The COG annotation reveals that the differentially
expressed genes are mainly involved in metabolic processes (Fig. 4), including glycolytic and gluconeogenic
genes and genes encoding the citric acid cycle (Table 1).
For approximately 35 differentially expressed genes a
homologous gene was identified to be CcpA regulated in
B. subtilis [32]. Of these genes a total number of 17 genes
were annotated to have a function in the glucose metabolism (Table 1). Genes that were first identified in this
study to be putatively regulated by CcpA with an apparent
and interesting function are discussed below.

One of the glycolytic genes found to be expressed lower in
the ccpA deletion strain was yfmT. This gene encodes a
non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPN), for which 2 putative CRE-sites could
be identified. We propose to rename yfmT as gapN, since
this gene shows similarity with gapN of the other members of the B. cereus group, and with gapN of B. halodurans,
Streptococci and Clostridia [33]. Notably, the gene is lacking in B. subtilis [29,33]. Next to the non-phosphorylating
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, two phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases
encoding genes (gapA and gapB) are present on the B.
cereus ATCC 14579 genome. The function of GAPN in
microbial metabolism is yet unclear. Recently, Asanuma
and Hino (2006) showed a role for CcpA in expression
control of gapN in Streptococcus bovis and proposed that
NADPH is provided by GAPN activity for NADPHdependent biosynthetic reactions, thereby maintaining an
optimal redox balance at the same time. However, in
hyperthermophilic archaea GAPN has been shown to play
a role in accelerating glycolysis as it can produce 3-phospho-D-glycerate from D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in a
one-step reaction, instead of two steps[34]. As a putative
drawback, ATP is not produced in this one-step reaction.
The exact role of GAPN in B. cereus metabolism remains
to be elucidated.

The gluconeogenic genes expressed higher in the ccpA
deletion strain included ywjI and gapB. The ywjI gene is
part of the putative murA2-ywjI operon and is annotated
as a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. The ywjI gene of B. subtilis, that shows similarity to ywjI of B. cereus, is annotated
to be a fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, as a member of the
glpX-family. The other annotated fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene for B. subtilis, fbp, which is no member of the
glpX-family, is not regulated by CcpA and deletion of this
gene seems to have no effect on gluconeogenesis [35]. A
corresponding fbp homologue appears to be absent in B.
cereus. However, on the B. cereus genome two members of
the glpX-family of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatases are
present, of which ywjI expression was found to be affected
by ccpA deletion, accordingly a putative CRE-site was
identified in the promoter region of its operon. The gapB
gene encodes a NAD(P)-dependent glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase. Three putative CRE-sites were
identified for gapB in B. cereus (Table 1). In contrast, no
CRE-sites were identified for gapB in B. subtilis, and its
expression was shown to be only indirectly affected by
ccpA deletion [36]. Furthermore, gluconeogenesis in B.
subtilis was shown to be regulated by the transcriptional
regulator CcpN [37,38]. CcpN is also present on the
genome of B. cereus ATCC 14579 and putative CcpN binding sites can be found in front of the gluconeogenic genes
encoding GapB and PckA [37]. Combined with our results
this would point to dual control of the expression of gluconeogenic genes in B. cereus by CcpN and CcpA.
The expression of genes with functions in routing metabolism towards the citric acid cycle appeared to be higher
in the ccpA deletion strain compared to the wild-type and
included ~30 genes involved in amino acid catabolism.
This included the bkd-operon (BC4163 to BC4157) that is
common among the Bacilli, and that is involved in the
catabolism of Valine and Leucine [39]. One putative CREsite in front of the bkd-operon and two within the operon
were identified in B. cereus ATCC 14579. Notably, CcpA
was previously shown to play no role in the regulation of
expression of this operon in B. subtilis [40]. In contrast, the
ilv-leu-operon of B. subtilis coding for biosynthesis of
branched chain amino acids has been shown to be activated by CcpA [41], whereas no involvement of CcpA was
found in regulation of expression of this operon in B.
cereus under the conditions tested. The fact that no regulation of the ilv-leu-operon was observed, although its
expression on the microarray was apparent (data not
shown), could be due to a complex regulation of this
operon under the tested circumstances involving CodY
and TnrA [41,42]. Expression of several genes encoding
enzymes involved in catabolism of nucleosides was
higher in the B. cereus ccpA deletion strain, this included
the putative yuf-operon (BC3791 to BC3788) encoding
nucleoside transport under the apparent control of the

transcriptional regulator encoded by the also higher
expressed ymfC (BC3792), for both the regulator and the
yuf-operon putative CRE-sites could be identified (see
Additional file 2). Interestingly, expression of two putative operons with an apparent function in catabolism was
higher in the ccpA deletion strain, and possible functions
were assessed using in silico analysis. The first operon
(BC0378-BC0380), which is not present in B. subtilis, consists of three genes and based on phylogenetic studies of
the protein sequences it is suggested to annotate the genes
as an L-fuculose phosphate aldolase [43] (BC0378), an Lfucose and/or arabinose isomerase (BC0379) and an Lfuculose phosphate aldolase (BC0380). This suggest a
function for this operon in the catabolism of fucose and/
or arabinose. Consequently, names and functions that we
suggest are fclI for the L-fucose isomerase (BC0379), fclK
for the L-fuculokinase (BC0378) and fclA for the L-fuculose phosphate aldolase (BC0380) (Fig. 5). A putative
CRE-site could be identified in front of this operon. The
second operon consists of three genes and in silico analysis
of this operon (BC1739-1741) suggested the transporter
protein (BC1739) to function as a proton/sodium-aspartate symporter [44], as an alternative to gltT. Subsequently, aspartate can be converted into ammonia and
fumarate by the aspartate ammonia lyase (BC1740), after
which fumarate can be metabolized to malate by one of
the two fumarate hydratases encoded on the genome of B.
cereus. The gene BC1741 encodes a malic enzyme, MalS,
which is responsible for converting malate into pyruvate.
This suggests that the operon encodes enzymes involved

in the catabolism of aspartate to pyruvate. This operon is
unique for the species of the B. cereus group, as the genes
are not found as an operon in genomes of other bacteria.
A putative CRE-site was identified for the first gene of the
operon (Fig. 5). The two-component system (BC1742BC1743) next to this operon shows high similarity with
the two-component system GlnK-GlnL of B. subtilis,
which is involved in glutamine utilization [45]. Whether
BC1742-BC1743 functions as a two-component system,
involved in aspartate sensing and triggering expression of
enzymes involved in its metabolism, remains to be elucidated.
Glutamate is a product of protein and amino acid catabolism and acts as link between nitrogen and carbon metabolism, mediated by glutamate synthase and glutamate
dehydrogenase, as described for B. subtilis [46,47]. The B.
subtilis genome contains a glutamate synthase (gltAB) and
two glutamate dehydrogenases (rocG and gudB) of which
the GudB dehydrogenase appears to be inactive [47].
Glutamate biosynthesis in B. subtilis has recently been
shown to be tightly regulated by interaction of RocG and
GltC [48], but these genes are not encoded on the B. cereus
genome. The microbial glutamate synthases generally
belong to the NADPH-GltS family of glutamate synthases
and are encoded by two genes [49]. In the glutamate synthase reaction L-glutamate is produced from L-glutamine
and 2-oxoglutarate, with the latter compound derived
from the citric acid cycle [49]. The gltAB operon of B. subtilis is suggested to be regulated by CcpA [46,50]. On the

genome of B. cereus ATCC 14579 only one glutamate synthase gene (gltA) is present and its expression at various
phases of growth is similar in the wild-type and its ccpA
deletion strain, indicating that its expression is not regulated by CcpA. Moreover, it is unclear to which family of
glutamate synthases GltA of B. cereus belongs. Interestingly, gudB was the only gene present on the genome of B.
cereus encoding a glutamate dehydrogenase, and its
expression was observed to be clearly higher in the ccpA
deletion strain (Table 1). Glutamate dehydrogenase is
responsible for the reaction from L-glutamate to 2-oxoglutarate linking L-glutamate to the citric acid cycle [51].
Higher expression of gudB in the ccpA deletion strain compared to the wild-type, together with the fact that it is the
only glutamate dehydrogenase annotated on the genome
of B. cereus suggests that GudB is the active glutamate
dehydrogenase for B. cereus. This is supported by the fact
that the 9-bp sequence, encoding the 3 amino acids causing the inactivity of GudB in B. subtilis [47], are absent in
the gudB sequence of B. cereus ATCC 14579. Two putative
CRE-sites in front of and one within gudB were identified
pointing to CcpA-controlled expression in B. cereus.

B. subtilis contains a large number of carbohydrate catabolic pathways [29], whereas the number of these pathways is limited in B. cereus. The observed deficiency of the
B. subtilis ccpA deletion strain in growth with ammonium
as the sole nitrogen-source, has been attributed to the regulation of the gltAB genes by CcpA [46,50] and the readthrough transcription of the rocG gene [47]. The lack of
regulation of gltA in B. cereus by CcpA, together with a
similarity to the B. subtilis gltA of only 46%, offers an
explanation for the observation that the ccpA deletion
strain of B. cereus is able to grow with ammonium as the
sole nitrogen source (data not shown), conceivably with
GudB as the active glutamate dehydrogenase.
The role of CcpA in optimisation of glucose metabolism
is apparent, since glycolytic enzymes were expressed lower
and expression of genes encoding citric acid cycle
enzymes was shown to be higher in the ccpA deletion
strain compared to the wild-type. Up-regulation in the
ccpA deletion strain was found for ~30 genes encoding
enzymes involved in protein, peptide and amino acid
metabolism (see Additional file 1). This is seemingly in
contrast with the proposed preferred use of proteinaceous

substrates for growth of B. cereus, a hypothesis put forward
by Ivanova et al. [9]. This hypothesis was supported by the
annotation of a large number of genes encoding proteolytic enzymes, a multiplicity of peptide and amino acid
transporters, and a large variety of amino acid degradation
pathways. However, under the conditions tested glucose
is used as the carbon and energy source (Fig. 1) and genes
encoding enzymes involved in protein, peptide and
amino acid catabolism appear to be subject to catabolite
repression, indicating that under the conditions tested,
glycolysis rather than protein catabolism is the preferred
energy generation route of B. cereus ATCC 14579.
CcpA-mediated catabolite control of enterotoxin gene
expression in B. cereus
In early- and mid-exponential phase cells the expression
of the nhe-operon (BC1809-BC1811), coding for the nonhemolytic toxin Nhe [52], was shown to be higher in the
ccpA deletion strain compared to the wild-type. This
higher expression was even more apparent in the stationary phase where an almost 20-fold stimulation was
observed (Fig. 6). Furthermore, a putative CRE-site was
identified for this operon. For the hbl-operon (BC3104BC3102), coding for the HBL enterotoxin [53], an 8-fold
increase in the ccpA deletion strain was seen in the stationary phase and a putative CRE-site could be identified (Fig.
6). Differential expression of cytK, encoding the enterotoxin Cytotoxin K [4], was not observed under the conditions tested, and no putative CRE-site could be identified.
These results indicate involvement of CcpA in the catabolite control of the expression of at least two major enterotoxins in B. cereus ATCC 14579. Many bacteria use glucose
as their preferred carbon and energy source as it can be
obtained from plant-derived polysaccharides, which can
be found in many environments including foods. We
hypothesize that glucose can function as a signalling molecule enabling CRE site-mediated, CcpA-dependent
repression of gene expression for microorganisms such as
Lactobacillus plantarum [54] and B. cereus that occur in several environments, including soil, plant and the human
gastro intestinal (GI) tract. In the GI tract, in the absence
of glucose, CcpA-dependent repression is thus lifted, and
this allows for induction of pathways involved in catabolism of other substrates present in the GI tract such as
fucose, a major degradation product of mucus related fucosylated glycans [55]. Notably, results of this study suggest the putative fucose utilisation operon of B. cereus to
be repressed by CcpA in the presence of glucose, and this
pathway may thus be activated in the GI-tract under glucose limiting conditions. A similar mode of regulation
seems applicable for the nhe and hbl enterotoxin operons,
for which the combination of transcriptome data and the
identification of putative CRE-sites, suggest these to be
CcpA controlled as well. Our results offer an explanation
for the observations recently made by Ouhib et al. [56],

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/62

who showed that final enterotoxin levels reached,
depended on the carbon and energy sources used for
growth, with the lowest levels reached with cells grown on
glucose. The anaerobic growth transcriptional regulators
FNR and ResD have recently been found to play a role in
enterotoxin production also, next to PlcR [57-59], and
combined with our data, this points to an elaborate control of enterotoxin production in B. cereus at the transcriptional level based on a variety of input signals mediated
by a range of transcriptional regulators. Notably, CcpA
has been reported also to play a role in toxin formation in
C. perfringens [26], and in S. aureus deletion of ccpA was
shown to affect the expression of the virulence gene hla,
encoding α-hemolysin [24].

Conclusion
B. cereus ATCC 14579 catabolite control protein CcpA is
involved in optimizing the catabolism of glucose with
concomitant repression of a range of metabolic pathways.
Furthermore, CcpA-mediated glucose sensing is shown to
provide an additional mode of control in moderating the
expression of the nhe- and hbl-operon in this human pathogen.

Methods
Bacterial strains, culture media, growth conditions, and
genetic methods
B. cereus ATCC 14579 and its ccpA deletion strain FM1403
were cultured in brain heart infusion broth (BHI, Becton
and Dickinson, The Netherlands) medium at 30°C, with
shaking at 200 rpm. The growth of the culture was monitored by measurement of the optical density at OD600. Dglucose concentrations were measured by use of a D-glucose measuring kit (Boehringer). Growth experiments and
glucose measurements were performed in three fold. Plasmid DNAs were purified from E. coli with a Qiaprep Spin
Miniprep kit (Westburg, Leusden, The Netherlands). Pwo
polymerase (Roche Diagnostics, Almere, The Netherlands) was used for PCR generated fragments that were
used in cloning and Taq polymerase (Fermentas, Amersfoort, The Netherlands) was used in control PCRs. E. coli
HB101/pRK24 [60] was used as the donor host in conjugation experiments. The antibiotics used were ampicillin
(Sigma, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) at a concentration
of 50 μg/ml, kanamycin (Sigma) at a concentration of 70
μg/ml, erythromycin (Sigma) at a concentration of 150
μg/ml (for E. coli) or 5 μg/ml (for B. cereus), spectinomycin (Sigma) at a concentration of 100 μg/ml, and polymyxin B (VWR, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) at a
concentration of 50 μg/ml for counter-selection against E.
coli upon conjugation.

ing regions was obtained by use of forward primer ccpAKOsacIforw (TCgagctcAGATTACGTTGATGTTATTC) and
reverse primer ccpAKOxbaIrev (TGtctagaAGAAGAAGAAAAAGAGGAAGAAAT). This PCR product was cloned
into pGemT-easy (Promega, Leiden, The Netherlands)
according to the manufacturer's protocol resulting in
pGemTccpA. Subsequently, an erythromycin-resistance
cassette amplified from pUC18ERY [61] with forward
primer
ErycasFBsrGI
(TCtgtacaGTCCGCAAAAGAAAAACG) and reverse primer ErycasRClaI (TCatcgatCATACCTAATAATTTATCTAC)
was
cloned
into
pGemTccpA after digesting both with Bsp1407I (BsrGI)
and Bsu15I (ClaI) (Fermentas). The insert of the resulting
plasmid, comprising the 1-kb flanking regions and the
erythromycin-resistance cassette was cloned into the conjugal vector pATΔS28 [62] by digestion of the insert and
the vector with XbaI and SacI (Fermentas). The resulting
plasmid pATΔCcpAery was isolated from DH5α and
transformed into E. coli HB101/pRK24. The resulting
strain was used in a conjugation experiment with B. cereus
ATCC 14579 following established procedures [63].
Transconjugants were obtained by selection for spectinomycin sensitivity and erythromycin resistance and one
was analysed in comparison with the wild-type strain.
PCR and Southern Blot analysis confirmed the deletion of
ccpA by double homologous recombination (data not
shown). The B. cereus ccpA deletion strain was designated
B. cereus FM1403.

RNA isolation
RNA was extracted from both the ccpA deletion strain and
the wild-type at four time points in the growth curve at
OD600 of 0.2, 0.8, 4 and 8 which corresponds to earlyexponential, mid-exponential, transition and stationary
phase of growth from two independent cultures per phase
by using RNAwiz (Ambion, Huntingdon, United Kingdom) according to the manufacturers protocol. Residual
DNA from the RNA preparations was enzymatically
removed by using TURBO DNA-free (Ambion). Extracted
RNA samples were stored in 70% EtOH, 0.3 M sodium
acetate buffer (pH 5.2) at -80°C.
Microarray construction and transcriptome analysis
Amplicon based DNA-microarrays were constructed for B.
cereus ATCC 14579 as described for L. lactis IL1403
[64,65] with modifications as detailed below. Amplicons
were designed on 5199 genes selected from the 5311
annotated genes (ORFs smaller than 80-bp were omitted)
on the genome of B. cereus ATCC 14579 [9]. To reduce
cross-hybridization between probe and target DNA
sequences the amplicons had sizes of 70 – 700-bp
(depending on gene sizes) and comprised the most
unique part of a gene. The amplicons were synthesized by
EuroGentec (Seraing, Belgium) in two amplification
steps. In the first amplification step, primers were used
with a unique tag-sequence for B. cereus ATCC 14579 (forward primers were extended with the sequence: 5'-TCGGGCAGCTGCTCC-3'; and reverse primers with the
sequence: 5'-TGGCGCCCCTAGATG-3'). Two copies of
each amplicon were present per array, resulting in microarrays comprising 10398 spots.

Normalized expression data (Feature Extract, Agilent) for
each spot was used in a statistical analysis. The biological
replicate experiments were merged with the web-supported VAMPIRE microarray suite, based on a Bayesian
frame work. Furthermore, VAMPIRE calculated p-values
for individual spots and subsequently used this p-value to
identify statistically differentially expressed spots between
compared growth conditions by use of a false discovery
rate (FDR) of 0.05 as a threshold [66,67]. In addition,
only ORFs of which both individual spots passed the FDR
based threshold were considered to be putatively differentially regulated. Expression ratios per ORF were established by calculating the average of the log-values of
individual spots. This value (R) was then used to calculate
the average expression ratio (10R) per ORF. Finally, only
ORFs that showed a change in expression of at least 2-fold
(up/down) were considered to be differentially expressed.
Microarray data are submitted to the GEO database with
accession number: GSE7843.
To determine gene similarity, homology and gene context
NCBI BLAST and the ERGO database were used [10],

while KEGG [68] was used for assessment of metabolic
functions and pathways. Whether succeeding genes were
part of one operon was determined according to operon
prediction as performed by [31].
Definition and identification of B. cereus CRE-site
The 350-bp upstream and 150-bp downstream sequences
of the translation start of genes identified by the array
experiments to be significantly higher expressed in the
ccpA deletion strain compared to the wild-type strain for
early- and mid-exponential growth were analyzed with
AlignACE 3.1 [69], which searches the input sequences for
stretches of nucleotides which align between the different
input sequences. The 13-bp CRE-sites identified by AlignACE were aligned with MUSCLE 3.6 [70] and a Hidden
Markov Model (HMM) was constructed with the HMMER
package [71]. The HMM was used to search CRE-sites in
the complete genome sequence of B. cereus ATCC 14579
[9], and not only the 350-bp upstream and 150-bp downstream sequences significantly higher expressed genes in
the ccpA deletion strain. Subsequently, to analyse whether
the B. cereus consensus was longer than 13-bp, the
obtained sites after the HMM search were extended to 18bp, as has been the reported length for B. subtilis [15]. The
resulting extended CRE-sites were again aligned using
MUSCLE 3.6 [70]. This alignment was subsequently visualized with WebLogo [72] and a iteration HMM search
was performed on the B. cereus ATCC 14579 sequence [9]
to identify all putative CRE-sites confirming to the new
alignment in the B. cereus ATCC 14579 genome.
