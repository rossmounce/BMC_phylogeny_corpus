Abstract
Background: Infection due to Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted
bacterial disease of global health significance, and especially the L-serovars causing
lymphogranuloma venereum are increasingly being found in Europe in men who have sex with men.
Results: The design and evaluation of a rapid, multiplex, real-time PCR targeting the major outer
membrane protein (omp-1) -gene and a L-serovar-specific region of the polymorphic protein H
(pmp-H) -gene for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis is reported here. The PCR takes place as
a single reaction with an internal control. For L1-, L2- and L3-serovar differentiation a second set
of real-time PCRs was evaluated based on the amplification of serovar-specific omp-1-regions. The
detection limit of each real-time PCR, multiplexed or not, was 50 genome copies per reaction with
an efficiency ranging from 90,5–95,2%.
In a retrospective analysis of 50 ocular, rectal and urogenital specimens formerly tested to be
positive for C. trachomatis we identified six L2-serovars in rectal specimens of HIV-positive men,
one in a double-infection with L3, and one L2 in a urethral specimen of an HIV-negative male.
Conclusion: This unique real-time PCR is specific and convenient for the rapid routine-diagnostic
detection of lymphogranuloma venereum-associated L-serovars and enables the subsequent
differentiation of L1, L2 and L3 for epidemiologic studies.

Background
Chlamydia trachomatis is a sexually transmitted, obligate
intracellular human pathogen leading to severe ocular
and urogenital tract infections. At present this heterogeneous species is divided into more than 20 serovars [1,2].
The serovars A, B, Ba and C cause trachoma, a chronic ocular disease found predominantly in developing countries,
whereas the serovars D, Da, E, F-I, Ia, J, Ja and K are the
aetiological agents of oculo-genital infections. While the

serovars A-K are usually non-invasive; the LGV-serovars
L1, L2, L2a, L2b and L3 are responsible for the sexually
transmitted disease (STD) lymphogranuloma venereum,
a severe invasive disease with preference for lymph tissue.
Infection can result in suppurative proctitis and lymphadenitis [3,4]. Genetic analysis has revealed a further class of
subtypes, the so-called mosaic-types. There are at present
five different mosaic types, one classified as B/D- [5], three
as L1/L2- [6] and a single Ba/D-mosaic [7]. These mosaics

have been proposed to emanate from recombination
events of the respective serovars.
For many years typing and diagnosis of C. trachomatis has
been based on the immunological detection of the major
outer membrane protein (MOMP) with subsequent
expansion into genetic analyses, particularly the detection
of the MOMP encoding gene, omp-1. The conserved
regions of the omp-1 gene were used for the species-specific detection of C. trachomatis and four variable regions,
VR1 to VR4 for sero- and genotyping [8-13].
To improve the sensitivity of chlamydial detection multicopy templates of 16S rDNA or a species-specific cryptic
plasmid of C. trachomatis with 10 copies per cell have been
targeted [14]. Real-time PCR assays have been developed
targeting omp-1 [15], the cryptic plasmid [16,17] or the
pmp-H gene [18,19].
In the molecular diagnostic of lymphogranuloma
venereum targeting the pmp-H gene has predominated as
all the LGV-serovars possess a unique gap of 36 nt which
is absent in the other serovars. Furthermore a pmp-Hbased restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)
pattern clusters the organism into distinct groups closely
associated with clinical disease: ocular, urogenital and
LGV [20]. Chen and co-worker published in 2006 an evaluation of a real-time, multiplex PCR targeting the pmp-H
gene resulting in the simultaneous detection of LGV and
differentiation from the other serovars [18].
Ongoing studies have revealed a progressive dissemination of the L2/L2b serotype in Europe among men who
have sex with men (MSM) [21-23]. Since 2003, 78 males
with LGV have been reported in Germany, 61 were confirmed as genotype/serovar L2 [24]. For the rapid detection of L2/L2b, a number of real-time PCR assays have
recently been developed [25-27], but so far no one-step
real-time PCR enabling the simultaneous differentiation
of L1 and L3 has been published.
After the publication of a case report describing the diagnosis of L1 in a MSM with proctitis in 1995 [28], we
started to develop a PCR assay allowing the detection and
differentation of the LGV-serovars. In this study we
present the development and evaluation of a multiplex
real-time PCR targeting the omp-1 gene for species-specific
detection of C. trachomatis and the pmp-H gene for LGV
typing. In addition, three real-time PCR assays were developed for the subsequent LGV differentiation into the L1-,
L2- and L3-serotypes.

Methods
Bacterial strains
To investigate the analytical specificities of the primers
and probes sixteen isolates were used representing the
serovars and serovariants of Chlamydia trachomatis (Table
3), and additionally C. muridarum, C. pneumoniae, C. pecorum, C. psittaci and twenty other microorganisms that normally reside in the human oropharynx, the urogenital and
perianal tract. These microorganisms corresponded to the
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and yeast previously described by Morré and coworker [19]: Acinetobacter
baumannii, Campylobacter jejuni, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Lactobacillus
casei, Mycoplasma genitalium, M. hominis, M. pneumoniae,
Neisseria meningitidis, Pasteurella multocida, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus aureus, Ureaplasma parvum and U. urealyticum.
Chlamydial DNA was kindly provided by Servaas Morré
and DNA extracts of the other microorganisms derived
from our diagnostic laboratory, each covering not less
than 10 ng DNA/2.5 µl.
Clinical specimens
The specimens with a request for detection of C. trachomatis originated from different departments of the University Clinic of Duesseldorf. Sample collection for routine
diagnostic procedures was conducted in adherence with
the guidelines of good clinical practice under approval of
the Institutional Review Board of the University Clinic
Duesseldorf. Written informed content was obtained
from all patients. Less than 10% were ocular samples.
43% of the samples emanated from women with clinical
symptoms and 7% from women for routine screening in
pregnancy. 32% of the specimens derived from departments specialising in sexual transmitted diseases especially of men (andrology (16%); dermatology (6%) and
infectious diseases, which also includes the treatment of
HIV-infected men, (10%)).

The ocular, urethral, cervical and rectal swabs were transported to the Medical Microbiology in 3 ml M4-transport
medium (Remel, UK) which contains 3–4 glass beads.
Upon arrival, the specimens were resuspended in the
medium by vortexing, and a portion of 1 ml centrifuged
at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was removed
and the sediment washed in 500 µl phosphate-buffered
saline, pH 7.3. After further centrifugation the sediment
was resuspended in 25 µl 10 mM Tris-(hydroxymethylaminomethan) (Tris)/HCl, pH 7,5. Thereafter 50 µl Proteinase K-solution (100 µg/ml Proteinase K - 0,5% Tween
20 in 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5) was added and the samples were incubated for 60 min at 56°C followed by inactivation of the Proteinase K at 95°C for 30 min. After a

short centrifugation, the samples were ready to be used in
PCR. If not tested immediately, they were stored at -20°C.
Design of Primers and Probes
Multiple-sequence alignments were performed with the
MegAlign program of the sequence analysis software of
DNASTAR (see Figures 1 and 3). The Primer Express Software of Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA, USA) was
used for the final design of specific primers and probes.
The omp-1-sequences (Figure 3) and pmp-H sequences
(serovars A (AY184155), B (AY184156), C (AY184158), J
(AY184165), K (184166), L1/2/3 (AY184167/8/9)) were
retrieved from the database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (see Availability and requirements section for URL). Primers and probes derived from
MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany), metabion (PlaneggMartinsried, Germany) or Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium).
PCR assays
The CT/LGV-real-time PCR assay was carried out in a total
volume of 25 µl consisting of 1 × Eurogentec MasterMix
without ROX, 5 mM MgCl2, Amperase (Eurogentec, Seraing), 150 nM CT-F primer, 115 nM each CT-R (-R1 and &W )RUZDUG 3ULPHU

R2) primer and 100 nM FAM-labelled CT-probe, 150 nM
of the LGV primers LGV-F and -R and 100 nM of the HEXlabelled LGV-probe and 2.5 µl of template DNA. As internal inhibition control 103 copies of IK_C plasmid and 100
nM TexasRed-labelled Dros-probe (for the detection of
internal control plasmid amplification) were added.
The L-serovar differentiation was either performed in four
monoplex or in two duplex real-time PCR assays (as indicated in the Results section). The L1/L2- and the L3/
GAPDH-real-time PCR were each carried out in a total volume of 25 µl consisting of 1 × Eurogentec MasterMix without ROX, 5 mM MgCl2, Amperase, 150 nM forward and
reverse primers, 100 nM labelled probes (see Table 1 for
the different fluorophores) and 2.5 µl of template DNA.
The conditions of the monoplex PCR assays were the same
other than a twofold concentration of primers and probes.
Thermal cycling conditions for all real-time PCR assays
were as follows: 1 cycle at 50°C for 10 min, 1 cycle at
95°C for 10 min followed by 45 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec
and 60°C for 1 min. Cycling, fluorescent data collection

CT-R1/R2 primer region

and analysis were carried out with an iCycler thermocycler
from BioRad according to the manufacturer's instructions.
The internal control plasmid IK_C was constructed essentially as described previously by Rosenstraus et al. [29].
The IK_C-F and -R primers (Table 1) used in the PCR were
composed of the respective 5'-sequence of the CT primers
R1 and R2 fused to 3'-sequences of the ninja transposon
of Drosophila simulans (not found in Chlamydia trachomatis). The plasmid pSARM [30] was used as template which
consists of a 276 bp sequence of the ninja transposon and
contains the 88 bp target sequence. This target sequence is
made up of a 44 bp region of the transposon, containing
the 29 bp region recognised by the Dros-probe, and
flanked by the primer sequences CT-R1 and CT-R2.
IK_C PCR was conducted in 100 µl 1 × Biorad iQ-Supermix with 3 mM MgCl2, 1 µM primer pair IK_C-F and -R
and 10 ng pSARM plasmid DNA under the following thermal cycling conditions: 1 cycle at 95°C for 5 min followed
by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec, 48°C for 30 sec and 72°C
for 30 sec.
Conventional L2-PCR was conducted in 100 µl 1 × Biorad
iQ-Supermix with 3 mM MgCl2, 1 µM primer pair L123-F
and L2-R under the same cycling conditions of the realtime PCR.

IK_C amplicon and the L2-PCR amplicon were isolated
using the PCR purification kit of Macherey and Nagel and
10–20 ng amplicons were ligated into 25 ng pGemT-easy
using the rapid DNA ligation kit from Roche following the
manufacturer's instructions and subsequently propagated
in E. coli DH5α . After cultivation on LB-Amp agar plates,
insert-positive clones were identified by restriction analysis and the sequence determined by sequencing using an
ABI sequencer using the method of Sanger et al. [31].

Results
Two genes for a species- and LGV-specific C. trachomatis
detection
Over a period of several years we evaluated the usefulness
of targeting a species-specific region of the omp-1 gene for
C. trachomatis detection by comparing real-time PCR data
with those produced by a commercial immuno-fluorescence test (IFT) from BioMerieux for perianal, urogenital
and ocular swabs [32]. The specificity of the TaqMan
primers and probe was verified by alignment of the amplified omp-1 gene regions of all known 20 serovars. To compensate for the two variant nucleotides within the reverse
primer binding site (marked by stars in Figure 1(a)) we
used a mixture of reverse primers, CT-R1 and -R2 (see
Table 1). In 2005, 26 of 985 specimens were positive in
the CT-real-time PCR whereas only 24 were IFT-positive.
Both methods showed 91.7 % concordance (data not
shown).

To enable a simultaneous detection of LGV-serovars
which, in Europe, have increasingly lead to infections in
men who have sex with men, we supplemented the CT
reaction with LGV detection. As the polymorphic membrane protein H gene, pmp-H has a unique deletion in all
LGV-serovars we chose this gene as a target for LGV detection. The LGV-primers used corresponded to those
designed by Morré and co-workers [19] whereas the deletion-spanning MGB-probe was replaced by a HEXlabelled standard TaqMan probe (Figure 1).
Combined in a duplex real-time PCR assay we first determined the sensitivity and the lower limits of the CT- and
LGV-detection using the pGemT-cloned amplicons as
template DNA in serial dilutions. All values were measured in duplicate and reproduced in a second run. As
shown in Figure 2, the quality of the CT- and LGV-PCR
assays was similar in terms of efficiency (93,7% and

90,5%), r2 values (0,988 and 0,993), linear detection
range between 109 and 102 copies per reaction and detection limits of about 50 genome copies per reaction.
We added a control plasmid, IK_C, to each PCR reaction
to monitor a possible inhibition of the PCR reaction. As
both the potential target C. trachomatis-DNA of a sample
and the added internal control DNA compete for the CTprimers, an absence of detection of the internal control by
the Tex Red-labelled probe was tolerated in samples with
a positive CT-detection, but indicative of PCR inhibition
in specimens negative for Chlamydia trachomatis. The
inclusion of the internal control did not interfere with the
sensitivity of the CT/LGV PCR and led to a maximal
increase of Ct-values of 2 cycles (Table 2). In all reactions
with less than 105 copies of CT-amplicon the internal
inhibition control plasmid was detected.

assay was determined using duplicates of 1.25 × [109, 107, 105, 103, 102, 101] copies of each cloned amplicon. The threshold values (Ct) were plotted against the corresponding copy numbers, and the efficiency, slope and linear regression correlation (r2)
were calculated for each reaction by the Biorad IQ5 software.

(b) Alignments of the respective omp-1-sequences of the serovars A to L grouped in the L1-, L2- or L3-cluster. The accession numbers of the serovars are indicated. Identical nucleotides are boxed, the binding sites of primers and

Differentiation of the LGV serotypes L1, L2 and L3
In order to develop a real-time PCR assay to detect and
discriminate between L1-, L2- and L3-serotypes, a multiple sequence alignment of the omp-1 genes revealed a less
conserved region which showed a 3'-overlap with the formerly described variable segment VS2 of omp-1 [7]. As
shown in a phylogenetic tree of this gene region (Figure
3(a)), the serotypes of C. trachomatis cluster in three main
branches:

• the L1-cluster containing the serotypes L1, D, Da, E, F
and G;
• the L2-cluster containing the L2-serotypes (L2, L2a and
L2b) and B/Ba; and

• the L3-cluster comprising the serotypes A, C, H, I/Ia, J/
Ja, K and L3.
The designed L1-, L2- and L3-TaqMan PCR assays differed
slightly in their relative positions within that gene region
(Figure 3(b)). We tested the sensitivity on amplicons of
the respective PCR, which had been cloned into a plasmid. The monoplex L1-, L2- and L3-PCR assays were similar in terms of efficiency (92.6% (L1), 95.3% (L2) and
93.5% (L3)), r2 values (0,987, 0,998 and 0,995 resp.), and
linear ranges between 109 and 102 copies per reaction. The
detection limits corresponded with 50 genome copies per
reaction to those of the CT/LGV duplex PCR. Analysing
DNA of the serovars L1, L2 and L3 the Ct-values remained
nearly un-affected when duplexing the HEX-labelled L1with the FAM -labelled L2-reaction; and the TET-labelled

PCR with (+) and without (-) addition of the internal control plasmid IK_C

L3- with the FAM-labelled GAPDH-PCR (Table 2). It
should be noted that the fluorescence of the TET-labelled
probe was detectable in the HEX-channel and in addition
of nearly the same intensity in the FAM-channel. The
amplification of human GAPDH provided a control of the
quality of the specimen. When duplexed with the L3-PCR
the value of the GAPDH-reaction was increased slightly in
the presence of a positive L3-reaction, whereas the L3value remained unaffected. To circumvent this problem in
a multiplex assay, another fluorophore (e.g. TexasRed)
should be used.

Specificity of the real-time PCR assays
The analytical specificity of the multiplex CT/LGV-, L1/L2and L3/GAPDH- real-time PCR assays was investigated by
testing the C. trachomatis serovars and other bacteria that
normally reside in the human perianal and urogenital
tract (see Materials and Methods). There was no crossreaction with DNA of non-chlamydial microorganisms
(data not shown) or with chlamydial species other than C.
trachomatis (Table 3). Analyses of the different C. trachomatis serovars revealed a high specificity of the newly developed real-time PCRs. However the serovars B, I-/Ia and L1
cross-reacted slightly, in that serovar B reacted in the LGVreaction, I-/Ia in L3-PCR and L1 in L2-PCR. As the Ct-values of the specific and non-specific reactions differed by a
factor of six or more, cross-reactions can be readily identified. Thus, the basic prerequisite for LGV-serotyping is a
positive LGV-PCR with a Ct-value comparable to that of
the CT-reaction. Weak cross-reactivity of L1-serovar in L2PCR was a disadvantage when duplexing the typing
assays. A highly positive L1-reaction and weak L2-PCR
could either be based on a double infection with a high
load of L1-serovar and a low load of L2-serovar or the
result of the cross reacting L1-DNA in the L2-PCR. To
avoid misinterpretation in this case the specimen must be
analysed either in monoplex L1- and L2-PCR assays or
subsequently in monoplex L2-real time PCR.
Retrospective analysis of C. trachomatis -positive
specimens
From 2004 to 2006 2381 ocular, urogenital and rectal
specimens were tested by monoplex CT-real time PCR for
C. trachomatis in the diagnostic laboratory. More than
90% of the tests were conducted on specimens from
patients with clinical signs of infection. Of the 67 CT-positive specimens 52 samples were still available for retrospective analysis of the LGV status. We analysed these
specimens in the CT/LGV duplex real-time PCR assay and

found 50 positive for C. trachomatis. They consisted of ten
conjunctival swabs, two poch of Douglas aspirations,
eleven cervix swabs, 2 tubal swabs, fourteen urethral
swabs and eleven rectal swabs. Two specimens, one urine
and one cervix swab were negative. This discrepancy may
be either due to a false-positive IFT or more probably to
degradation of the DNA as an in-house nested PCR targeting 800 bp of the omp1 gene was also negative.

ing the serovars D-K and L1, L2 and L3 in the second,
nested step [34]. Modifying the conditions to a singletube nested amplification would create a rapid, safe and
sensitive method for genotyping C. trachomatis. Considering the disadvantages of post-PCR amplicon handling as
well as the costs of these assays, these methods seem at the
moment to be more suitable for epidemiological studies
rather than the routine diagnostic laboratory.

As summarised in Table 2, seven of the 50 C. trachomatis
positives were also positive in LGV detection, all from
men (six rectal and one urethral swab). With comparable
Ct-values in both reactions a double infection with LGVand non-LGV-serovars could be excluded. The rectal
swabs were taken from HIV-positive patients, four of
whom had ulcerating proctitis. The urethral specimen
came from a HIV-negative patient with an urethral ulcer.
LGV typing revealed that six were of L2-type. One rectal
specimen revealed a double-infection with L2- and L3serovars (Table 2). Sequencing of the L3-amplicon of the
double positive specimen confirmed the presence of L3DNA. As the sequence of the L2-amplicon is identical in
L2-, L2a- and L2b-serovars and therefore unqualified for
further sub-typing the L2-positives were subjected to a
conventional PCR amplification of an extended region of
omp-1 including point mutations between the subtypes.
Sequence analysis of the PCR-products revealed that they
were all of L2b-subtype.

The discrimination of LGV-serotypes from the other serovars of C. trachomatis is of major clinical importance as different antibiotic treatment regimens are required [35].
Detection is often based on amplification of the well
known omp-1 gene, which encodes the major outer membrane protein, whereas other nucleic acid-based applications have used the pmp-H gene, in which the unique
deletion in the LGV-serovars facilitates the design of an
LGV-specific PCR, or the species-specific cryptic plasmid
of C. trachomatis.

Discussion
The LGV-serotypes of C. trachomatis are emerging pathogens in the industrial world for men who have sex with
men, often in association with HIV co-infection. The LGVserovars cause acute illness, may persist for extended periods and, if untreated, may facilitate the spread of HIV.
LGV clinical care, surveillance and research are severely
hindered by the lack of widely available, rapid, standardized tests for the diagnosis of LGV.
Recently, a number of PCR-based test systems were published facilitating the identification of the LGV-associated
L-serovars. Some of these dealt with the detection und
typing of nearly all serovars of C. trachomatis in a given
sample. For this purpose the groups of Molano [11] and
Xiong [12] developed PCR-based reverse line blot (RLB)
hybridisation tests and Quint and coworker used a PCRbased microplate reverse hybridisation assay (RHA) [33].
These methods were highly specific and suitable for the
detection of mixed C. trachomatis serovars in a specimen.
However, these methods require handling of the PCR
products for subsequent analyses which is a possible
source of contamination and therefore to be used with
caution. This is also true of a two-step nested real-time
PCR developed by the group of Jalal in 2007 which targeted the omp-1 gene and used eleven probes for genotyp-

The group of Limberger evaluated a duplex real-time PCR
based on the amplification of the cryptic plasmid (C. trachomatis-specific) and the omp-1 gene (serovar L2) [26].
Targeting the cryptic plasmid increases the sensitivity 10fold, as there may be up to 10 plasmid copies per cell [16].
However, deletions found in the cryptic plasmid of some
isolates were shown to affect nucleic acid amplification
tests used in Sweden [36]. These findings suggest that
detection of more than one gene of C. trachomatis may be
necessary to avoid false-negative results due to mutation
or recombination within the target sequences. Periodic
checks of recently published mutations within the target
gene regions will minimise the risk of decreased sensitivity.
In 2006 Goldenberger et al. published the evaluation of
two real-time and one conventional PCR which targeted
omp-1, the first two did not discriminate between L2 and
L2b, whereas the latter was L2b-specific [25]. In our study
we developed and evaluated a duplex real-time PCR for
the simultaneous detection of C. trachomatis, targeting the
omp-1 gene, and identification of the LGV-serotypes by
targeting the deletion-spanning pmp-H-gene region. Completed by an inhibition control plasmid this assay fulfils
the requirements of a specific routine diagnostic method.
Although not as sensitive as the nested real time PCR
assays described above [34] the sensitivity of this assay
corresponds to that of Halse and coworkers [26] and was
shown to exceed a commercial immuno-fluorescence test
which is still considered the gold standard.
In a retrospective analysis of 50 ocular, rectal and urogenital specimens which were known to be positive for C. trachomatis we found seven positive for an LGV-serotype.
Most of the specimens were obtained from HIV positive

MSM. With comparable Ct-values in both reactions, CT
and LGV, a double-infection with non-LGV-serovars was
unlikely. With the newly developed omp-1-based real-time
PCR assays we were able to discriminate between the LGVserovars L1, L2 and L3 and to subtype the seven LGV-positives: six L2-positive and one L2/L3 positive specimen.
Sequence analyses revealed that the seven L2-serovars
detected in our study were all L2b-subtype, which is the
most common LGV-serotype found in European MSM
[23].

Competing interests
The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

This is, to our knowledge, the first description of a differentiation of the three main LGV-serovars by the use of
one-step real-time PCR assays which additionally enabled
the discovery of a L2/L3 double-infection in a rectal specimen of a European MSM.
Genotyping analyses of C. trachomatis have revealed that
recombination has also led to mosaic-variants of two
serotypes [5-7]. Three L1/L2-variants have been described
which carry mosaic omp-1-genes in which recombination
in the variable region VS2 occurred [6] a mere 2 bp downstream of the L1-amplicon in our PCR (see Figure 3). Such
mosaic recombinants would be indistinguishable from
normal L1-serotypes in the L1-real-time PCR. A L1-serovar
has already been detected in an MSM with proctitis [28]
and detection of an L1/L2-mosaic in such patients will, in
the future, rely on the sequencing of the downstream
region. Nevertheless, although Gomes and co-worker [37]
have found that C. trachomatis is prone to widespread
recombination an altered pathogenicity has not been correlated to any specific recombination event. Regarding the
higher virulence of LGV-serotypes in contrast to the other
urogenital serovars, it is interesting that in a newly developed multi-locus sequence typing method for C. trachomatis ten specimens from MSM were identified as omp-1
genotype G [38].

The L2/L3 double infection which was detected in a European MSM by our study may be the pre-requisite for the
creation of a new mosaic-variant. To take this into
account, future epidemiological studies should be performed by methods that enable the detection of doubleinfections and include screening for new recombinants.
To validate the real time PCR assays presented here we will
continue to sequence all new LGV-positives in future
work.

Conclusion
The two sets of real-time PCRs presented in this study enable the rapid identification and differentiation of the LGVserovars L1, L2 and L3. The CT/LGV multiplex PCR is a
useful tool for the routine diagnostic of specimens from
MSM. For epidemiological studies this test can be
