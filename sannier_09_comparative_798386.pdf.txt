Abstract
Background: The high diversity of ornamentation type in pollen grains of angiosperms has often
been suggested to be linked to diversity in pollination systems. It is commonly stated that smooth
pollen grains are associated with wind or water pollination while sculptured pollen grains are
associated with biotic pollination. We tested the statistical significance of an association between
pollen ornamentation and pollination system in two families of the monocotyledons, the Araceae
and the Arecaceae, taking into account the phylogenetic framework.
Findings: Character optimization was carried out with the Maximum Parsimony method and two
different methods of comparative analysis were used: the Concentrated-Change test and the
Discrete method. The ancestral ornamentation in Araceae is foveolate/reticulate. It is probably the
same in Arecaceae. The ancestral flowers of Araceae were pollinated by beetles while ancestral
pollination in Arecaceae is equivocal. A correlation between ornamentation type and pollination
was highlighted in Araceae although the results slightly differ depending on the method and the
options chosen for performing the analyses. No correlation was found in palms.
Conclusion: In this study, we show that the relationships between the ornamentation type and
the pollination system depend on the family and hence vary among taxonomic groups. We also
show that the method chosen may strongly influence the results.

Findings
The exine wall of the pollen grains of flowering plants displays patterns of ornamentation (the external aspect of
pollen grains, also called sculpturing) that are highly
diversified. The reasons accounting for such variation in
the ornamentation of pollen grains in flowering plants

still remain unclear. Among the different types of relationship implying pollen ornamentation that have been suggested, the existence of a link between exine sculpturing
and pollinator type has often been proposed and was even
evidenced in certain situations (see additional file 1). It is
often considered that smooth pollen grains are associated

with abiotic pollination (wind or water) while echinulate
or reticulate pollen grains are associated with biotic pollination, particularly entomophily [1,2]. These results show
that the adaptiveness of this character still remains largely
debated.
The study presented here aims to test the hypothesis suggested by Grayum [3] concerning a relationship between
pollen ornamentation and pollinator type in the Araceae,
using Phylogenetic Comparative Methods. He established
a correlation between (a) psilate and verrucate pollen and
pollination by beetles and (b) echinulate pollen and pollination by flies. We think that the flaw of this study is
inherent to the fact that correlations were established
without statistical analysis and without taking into
account the phylogenetic background of the family, making it impossible to know whether the correlations
observed between the pollen and pollinator types result
from adaptation or from common ancestry.
The processes underlying a relationship between two
characters remain generally extremely difficult to determine [4,5]. A correlation may be the result of adaptation,
but also of developmental constraints. It may also be simply the result of phylogenetic inertia i.e., that related species resemble each other more than they resemble species
drawn at random [6]. Various mathematical approaches,
called Phylogenetic Comparative Methods or PCM [4,7],
have been proposed over the last twenty years [8-10] and
take into account the phylogenetic background of the
organisms studied.
Here we re-examine the correlation between pollen sculpturing and pollinator type proposed by Grayum [3], in
light of the phylogenetic framework available for the
Araceae family [11] using two PCM applied to discrete
characters. In the conclusion of his paper, Grayum suggested to investigate other groups of monocotyledons,
palms in particular. In this family a large amount of pollen data has been recorded but rarely studied from an evolutionary point of view, except for the number of
apertures [12]. Moreover data on pollinators are available
and a detailed and well resolved phylogeny including
almost all of the genera [13] now exists. Consequently we
also examine the correlation between pollen and pollinator types in the palm family (Arecaceae).
Methods (for details, see additional file 2)
Character optimization was carried out with the Maximum Parsimony method implemented in the Mesquite
software [14].
Two PCMs were used: the Concentrated Changes Test or
CCT [9] and Discrete [10].

Results and discussion
Character evolution in the Araceae
To our knowledge, there is little data in the literature concerning the evolution of ornamentation of pollen grains
in monocots [15]. Concerning the angiosperms, a recent
study showed that the ancestral exine structure had a continuous or microperforate surface [16]. However, foveolate-reticulate tectum would have arisen soon after [16].
The work of Grayum [17] that is re-examined here, provides hypotheses about the ancestral and derived states of
pollen wall sculpturing within the Araceae (monocots).
His proposition that the most primitive aroid pollen had
foveolate to reticulate exine is not in contradiction with
our phylogenetic analysis of the character. Indeed, our
results suggested that the hypothetical aroid pollen was
either 'Foveolate/Reticulate' or 'Psilate' for pollen ornamentation (Figure 1A). The equivocal ancestral state is
probably due to the polytomies, coded as soft (uncertainty in resolution), that are present in the tree. From this
equivocal type, different types of sculpturing evolved [17].
However, no type of ornamentation is restricted to one
clade and no particular trend in the evolution of the character emerged clearly from our analysis. It can be noted
that several ornamentations originated several times independently and most of all, from different character states.
This indicates that some transitions may occur indifferently among the different states.

Concerning the pollination type, optimization of character evolution suggested that the last common ancestor of
the family was pollinated by 'Beetle' (Figure 1B), according to outgroup comparison with other Alismatales [17].
From this condition, the other types of pollination each
evolved several times within the family. In particular, fly
pollination is clearly derived from beetle pollination in
Aroideae, where it evolved in several unrelated genera and
is synapomorphic for the Arisaemateae+Areae clade (indicated by a red arrow in Figure 1).
After the transformation of the coding from multistate to
binary characters (Figure 2 and additional files 3, 4 and
5), we sought to test a correlation between pollen ornamentation and pollinators using the concentrated-change
test [9] and the discrete method [10]. When polymorphic
species were removed, both methods found a correlation
between the ornamentation and the pollination (Tables 1
and 2, additional files 6 and 7). The Echinulate type was
found as contingent upon Fly pollination (changes
towards Echinulate pollen happened more often in Fly
pollinated taxa; Table 1) with the CCT only. However,
with the Discrete method, the flow diagram showed that
transitions towards Fly pollination were probably followed by transitions towards Echinulate ornamentation
(Figure 3).

When polymorphic species were duplicated, a correlation

treat polymorphic species as pairs of species (duplicate)
with contrasting character states [19] is the most conservative option and avoids loss of information. In conclusion, it is important to be aware of this problematic when
a choice has to be made.

These results indicate that the impact of adding/removing
information on the detection of a correlation varies
according to the method used (CCT or Discrete). The
interpretation of the results may then be strongly influenced by the method chosen, as already shown [18]. In
our case, duplicating polymorphic species leads to
increase the number of opposing associations (associa-

Character evolution in the Arecaceae
In spite of the important literature on pollen ornamentation available for the Arecaceae [20], no steady hypotheses have been proposed about the ancestral
ornamentation, apart from a suggestion that psilate exine
could be the primitive condition [21]. The present study is
the first that makes hypotheses about the ancestral fea-

tures of pollen grain in palms using a phylogenetic
approach. In our analysis, the ancestral character state for
the family was inferred as 'Echinulate' (Figure 4A). However, the reconstruction of the ornamentation character
on a phylogeny of the family including all of the genera
inferred a 'Foveolate/Reticulate' ancestral character state
(personal information). This conflict is explained by the
presence of only polymorphic genera in Calamoideae in
our study.
The Pollination type appeared as a very variable character
and consequently, no clear evolutionary trend emerged
from the character optimisation (Figure 4B). The ancestral
pollinators either were bees, beetles or flies, and the pollination type for each subfamily (except Nypoideae) was

ambiguous. In this family, even with the binary coding
(Figure 5, additional file 8), polymorphic species were so
numerous that when they were removed, according to one
of the option chose, there were not enough data left to
perform any test. When polymorphic species were duplicated, as a result of the high variability in characters, the
comparative analyses failed to detect a correlation
between ornamentation type and pollination type in Arecaceae, whatever the method used (Tables 2 and 3, additional files 9 and 10).
Relationships between ornamentation type and
pollination
The reason why Angiosperms display such a large diversity
of pollen ornamentation remains to date rather unclear.

Several studies addressing this question have been produced, often leading to conflicting, or at least different,
conclusions. Most studies however examine the hypothesis of a link between pollen ornamentation and the pollination system. The underlying idea is that since pollen
grains need a vector (biotic or abiotic) to reach the female
parts, the pollen surface may play a role in the efficiency
of the interaction either with the pollination agent or with
the receptive area of the female organs. A relationship
between abiotic pollination (wind and water) and
smooth (or nearly) pollen grains has been proposed in
many studies [1,22] but concerning biotic pollination, the
results are more controversial. [2,3,23,24]. According to
previously published studies [3,20,24], our results suggest

that the relationship between pollen ornamentation and
pollinators may actually depend on the taxon. The association between psilate (=smooth) pollen and beetles seems
to be rather specific to the Araceae, since entomogamous
species are generally thought to produce pollen grains
with a deeply sculptured exine [1,23]. The idea is that the
sculptures would enhance the adherence of the pollen
grains to the insect body by allowing a better storage of
the pollenkitt. This sticky substance, of which functions
are not yet quite understood, is produced by entomogamous species and stored on the surface of the pollen wall
[25]. The pollenkitt would enable pollen grains to adhere
on the hairs of insects or on the feathers of birds in case of
ornithophily [23,24]. In the Araceae however, pollen
grains were depicted as poor in pollenkitt [26] and it was
suggested that sticky secretions on the stigma and/or the
inner spathe surface may play the same role as the pollenkitt [27], accounting for the lack of pollen ornamentation in beetle pollinated species of Araceae.
The fact that no correlations could be detected in the palm
family may be due to various reasons. First, it has to be
stressed that the sampling was sparser for palms than for
the Araceae. In particular, there was a poor overlap at the
species level between the pollen and the pollinator datasets. This led us to combine information from different
species for the ornamentation type, which we are aware
may be questionable considering the high lability of the
character even at the intraspecific level. We tried to overcome this problem by attributing polymorphic character
states whenever intrageneric diversity was recorded, and
by applying two different treatments to polymorphic species in the comparative analyses but we cannot exclude
that the choices made here (due to the scarcity of data con-

means that changes from 'Other' to 'Beetle' pollination are more likely to occur when the ornamentation is 'Psilate/Verrucate'. Omnibus tests

cerning pollination systems in palms) may have biased
the results. However, there is a possibility that our results
indeed reflect the reality and that pollen ornamentation is
not involved in the pollination syndrome in palms. In this
family, the traits linked to pollinator identity still remain
almost unknown. Palm flowers are relatively poorly diversified in morphology when compared to the spectacular
flowers of other groups [20]. In many species, flowers are
visited by many insect families and species (often more
than 50 species), although maybe among these insects
only a single or a small number of species effectively act as
pollinators [28]. The lack of correlation between pollen
ornamentation and pollinators may be accounted for by a
weak degree of specialization in the pollination system, or
it may be that some other factors (like pollenkitt or scents
for example) may be dominant in the pollen-pollinator
interaction.

In conclusion, it is our feeling that there is little to be
gained from seeking a general tendency concerning the
relationship between the type of pollen ornamentation
and the pollination system across the angiosperms. The
ornamentation of the pollen wall is only one of the
numerous elements that constitute the pollination syndrome and certainly not the most important [29]. Like the
other factors [30], the relative importance of its role in the
plant-pollinator interaction may indeed vary among plant
taxa or according to geography, and it may have an adaptive value in some groups but evolve in a neutral way in
other groups.

Detailed results about the comparative analyses conducted with the
Concentrated-Changes Test in Arecaceae. Pollen ornamentation was
coded as 'Echinulate' vs. 'Other Ornamentation', pollination system was
coded as 'Fly' vs 'Other Pollination'. A – Distribution of events in the
character 'pollination type' on branches reconstructed as having 'Echinulate' and 'Other-O' ornamentation, respectively. B – Distribution of
events in the character ornamentation type on branches reconstructed as
having 'Fly' and 'Other-P' pollination, respectively. O: Other-P or OtherO depending on the context; F: Fly; E: Echinulate; 1: Pollination and
ornamentation type reconstructed with ACCTRAN; 2: Pollination and
ornamentation type reconstructed with DELTRAN. The Fisher exact test
was computed for the columns with numbers in bold (transitions OB
and OO for table A; OP/V and OO for table B).

Evolution of the ornamentation and of the pollination in Arecaceae
when polymorphic species are duplicated and with the coding 'Echinulate' vs. 'Other Ornamentation' and 'Fly' vs 'Other Pollination'. A.
Optimization of the ornamentation type coded as 'Other-O' (white) and
'Echinulate' (black). B. Optimization of the pollination type coded as
'Other-P' (white) and 'Fly' (black). The bicoloured branches indicate an
equivocal inference of the ancestral character state. The transitions
towards 'Fly' pollination and 'Echinulate' ornamentation are indicated by
full crossbars and the reversals towards 'Other-P' pollination and 'OtherO' ornamentation are indicated by open crossbars (red and blue crossbars
correspond respectively to the ACCTRAN and DELTRAN optimizations).
Species names are coloured according to the subfamilies (Calamoideae in
blue, Nypoideae in orange, Coryphoideae in green, Ceroxyloideae in pink
and Arecoideae in red).
