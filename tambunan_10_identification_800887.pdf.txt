Abstract
Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the most common on sexually transmitted viruses in the world. HPVs are
responsible for a large spectrum of deseases, both benign and malignant. The certain types of HPV are involved in
the development of cervical cancer. In attemps to find additional drugs in the treatment of cervical cancer, inhibitors of the histone deacetylases (HDAC) have received much attention due to their low cytotoxic profiles and the
E6/E7 oncogene function of human papilomavirus can be completely by passed by HDAC inhibition. The histone
deacetylase inhibitors can induce growth arrest, differentiation and apoptosis of cancer cells. HDAC class I and class
II are considered the main targets for cancer. Therefore, the six HDACs class II was modeled and about two inhibitors (SAHA and TSA) were docked using AutoDock4.2, to each of the inhibitor in order to identify the pharmacological properties. Based on the results of docking, SAHA and TSA were able to bind with zinc ion in HDACs models
as a drug target. SAHA was satisfied almost all the properties i.e., binding affinity, the Drug-Likeness value and Drug
Score with 70% oral bioavailability and the carbonyl group of these compound fits well into the active site of the
target where the zinc is present. Hence, SAHA could be developed as potential inhibitors of class II HDACs and
valuable cervical cancer drug candidate.
Introduction
The human papillomavirus (HPV) is a family of sexually
transmitted, double-stranded DNA viruses with over
100 different genotypes identified till date. It is associated with many different types of cancers including
cervical, vaginal, head and neck, penile and anal cancer.
With approximately 450,000 newly diagnosed cases each
year and a 50% mortality rate [1,2], cervical cancer is
the second most common cause of cancer-related death
in women worldwide and it is almost always associated
with HPV [3,4]. Cervical cancer is the most common
cancer of women in most developing countries, where it

may account for as many as one fourth of female cancers [5].
HPV genotypes are divided into the low risk and high
risk categories based on the spectrum of lesions they
induce. The low-risk types induce only benign genital
warts and include HPV 6 and 11. The high-risk group
containing HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 45 and 56 is associated
with the development of anogenital cancers and can be
detected in 99% of cervical cancers [6], with HPV16
found in 50% of cases [7].
A consistently effective and safe treatment for HPV
infections is currently not yet available. Present therapeutic options are more directed at surgical eradication
and/or by destroying malignant lesions via physical or
chemotherapeutical intervention. A majority of these
treatments have been developed empirically, few have
been thoroughly tested, but none of them are completely satisfactory. In attemps to find additional drugs in

the treatment of cervical cancer, inhibitors of the histone deacetylases have received much attention due to
their low cytotoxic profiles [5].
The structural modification of histones is regulated
mainly by acetylation/deacetylation of the N-terminal
tail and is crucial in modulating gene expression,
because it affects the interaction of DNA with transcription-regulatory non-nucleosomal protein complexes.
The balance between the acetylated/deacetylated states
of histones is mediated by two different sets of enzymes:
histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). HATs prefentially acetylate specific
lysine substrates among other nonhistones protein substrates and transcription factors, affecting DNA-binding
properties and, in turn, altering gene transcription.
HDACs restore the positive charge on lysine residues by
removing acetyl groups and thus are involved primarily
in the repression of gene transcription by compacting
chromatin structure. Therefore, open lysine residues
attach firmly to the phosphate backbone of the DNA,
preventing transcription. In this tight conformation,
transcription factors, regulatory complexes, and RNA
polymerases cannot bind to DNA Acetylation relaxes
the DNA conformation, making it accessible to transcription machinery. High levels of acetylation of core
histones are seen in chromatin-containing genes, which
are highly transcribed genes; genes that are silent are
associated with low levels of acetylation. Inappropriate
silencing of critical genes can result in one or both hits
of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in cancer [8].
Members of the classical HDAC family fall into two
different phylogenetic classes, namely class I and class
II. The class I HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and
HDAC8) are most closely related to the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Class II HDACs (HDAC4, HDAC5,
HDAC6, HDAC7, HDAC9, and HDAC10) share
domains with similarity to HDA1, another deacetylase
found in yeast [9].
The inhibition of HDAC activity by a specific inhibitor
induces growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis of
transformed cells as well as several cancer cells [10].
Recent studies were directed to investigate the molecular effects of HDAC inhibition on cervical carcinoma
cells as well as on primary human foreskin keratinocytes, separately immortalized with amphotropic retroviruses that carry the open reading frames of HPV 16
E6, E7 or E6/E7.
In these experiments one could show that E6/E7
oncogene function of human papillomavirus can be
completely bypassed by HDAC inhibition. Both malignant and immortalized HPV 16/18-positive cells became
blocked in G1/S transition despite ongoing viral gene
expression. G1 arrest was accompanied by a down-regulation of cyclin D and cyclin A and a concomitant up-

regulation of the cyclin kinase inhibitors (CKI) p21 and
p27. Binding of both CKIs led to a complete block of
the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk2) activity and in turn
prevented binding of E7. This was intriguing with
respect to the reversibility of HPV transformation process, since it is thought that the abrogation of the
growth inhibitory function of p21 and p27 through E7
represents a key event in HPV-induced carcinogenesis.
HDAC inhibitors also trigger pRb degradation, while
E2F expression remained unaffected. pRb degradation is
an E7- specific phenomenon, since in E6-positive cells
pRb only became hypophosphorylated. The presence of
E2F under cell cycle arrest led to a classical “conflict
situation” which finally induced apoptosis [11-13].
Hence, the knowledge how the transforming potential of
HPV can be bypassed without switching off viral transcription could open new therapeutical perspectives for
the treatment of cervical cancer [14].
The aim of this work is to analyze the interaction of
Homo sapiens class II HDACs with SAHA and TSA that
are already in the phase I/II clinical trials based on their
binding affinity and pharmacological properties. Since,
no theoretical works have been carried out in identifying
the properties and specificity, we intend to identify the
group that could act as potential binding inhibitors.
In this paper, we present homology models of six
Homo sapiens Class II HDACs (HDAC4, HDAC5,
HDAC6, HDAC7, HDAC9, and HDAC10) that are validated by comparison with the X-ray structure of
HDAC4 and HDAC7, which became available during
the course of our study. Two HDAC inhibitors (SAHA
and TSA) are docked to the six homology models. The
pharmacological properties of SAHA and TSA were
identified using Molinspiration, Osiris Property, ToxBoxes, and Toxmatch-v1.06. Therefore, the molecular
binding interactions between the histone deacetylases
with SAHA and TSA were analyzed to provide some
insights into the molecular interactions and designing
new HDAC inhibitors.

Materials and methods
Sequence alignment and homology modeling

Sequences of HDAC4 (Genbank Accession Number
NP_006028.2,410aa), HDAC5 (Genbank Accession Number NP_005465.2,383aa), HDAC6 (Genbank Accession
Number NP_006035.2,264aa), HDAC7 (Genbank Accession Number NP_056216.2,422aa), HDAC9 (Genbank
Accession Number NP_848510.1,376aa), and HDAC10
(Genbank Accession Number NP_114408.3,382aa) were
extracted from the NCBI protein sequence database. The
eleven three-dimensional structures of HDAC4 and
HDAC7 (PDB code 2H8N, 2094, 2VQJ, 2VQM, 2VQO,
2VQQ, 2VQV, 2VQW, 3C0Y, 3C0Z, and 3C10) were
used to find the catalytic domain of Homo sapiens Class

II HDACs. All sequences were imported into the ClustalW program [15] and the sequence alignment editor,
BioEdit, for multiple pairwise alignments. The resulting
alignments were examined manually. The four dimensional structure of HDAC (PDB code: 1C3P, 1ZZ1,
2VQM, and 3EW8) was used as a template for Homo
sapiens Class II HDACs homology modeling in the Modeller9v7 program [16]. The multiple alignment between
catalytic domain of class II HDACs and templates, using
HHpred web server http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/
hhpred to get an alignment pir format as an input format
for homology modeling in the Modeller9v7 program [17].
Molecular docking

AutoDock4.2 was used for all docking calculations. The
grid boxes size was implemented for HDAC4, HDAC5,
HDAC6, HDAC7, HDAC9, and HDAC10 were 19.228 ×
-6.296 × 0.177; 19.969 × -6.093 × 0.513; 15.326 × -7.608
× 8.495; 18.484 × -6.198 × -0.744; 18.078 × -7.314 ×
-2.129; 17.713 × -6.707 × 1.288 points with a spacing
0.375, respectively. For SAHA and TSA, the single
bonds except the amide bond were treated as active torsional bonds. One hundred docked structures, i.e. 100
runs, were generated by using genetic algorithm
searches. A default protocol was applied, with an initial
population of 150 randomly placed individual structures,
a maximum number of 2.5 × 10 6 energy evaluations,
and a maximum number of 2.7 × 10 4 generations. A
mutation rate of 0.02 and a crossover rate of 0.8 were
used (Figure 1).
Binding energy calculations

The Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) software was used for binding energy calculations [18].
Starting from the ligand conformations which is binding
to Zn2+ ion in class II HDACs structure obtained by the
docking process, were used as an input for binding
energy calculations. The pdb format of class II HDACs
and ligands complex was converted to pqr format by
adding missing atoms, optimizing hydrogen bonding
and assigning atomic charge and radius parameters. The
CHARMM22 force field parameters were assigned to
the class II HDACs. For ligand parameterization
requires a MOL2-format representation of the ligand to
provide the necessary bonding information. In this
research, MOL2-format files were obtained through
PRODRG web server http://davapc1.bioch.dundee.ac.uk/
prodrg/.

of the descriptors. Molinspiration http://www.molinspiration.com/ and Osiris Property explorer http://www.
organic-chemistry.org/prog/peo/ were used to calculate
twelve descriptors- logP, solubility, drug likeliness, polar
surface area, molecular weight, number of atoms, number of rotatable bonds, volume, drug score and number
of violations to Lipinski’s rule for SAHA and TSA taken
for the analysis [19].
Toxicity prediction

Toxicity is defined as a dose-linked unsafe effect of a
chemical compound on a target life form. Safety issues
and ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and
Excretion) are major factors in drug failure and they are
crucial to identify early in the discovery process to
reduce late-stage attrition. ADME-Tox Box of PharmaAlgorithms http://pharma-algorithms.com/physchem.
html was used to predict the various toxicity effects
such as rat LD50, mouse LD50, oral bioavailability, Ames
test, pKa and ion fraction values.

The final result of multiple sequence alignment of the

Visualization of those residues using PyMOL, showed
that area was solvent accessible and has negative charge
electrostatic potential surface.
After sequence alignment of the Homo sapiens class II
HDACs, five models for each of the six HDACs were
generated through the Modeller9v7 program. The quality of the models thus obtained was then evaluated with
respect to the conformation of the peptide backbone
and the packing environment. Generation of the Ramachandran plots using VADAR (Volume, Area, Dihedral
Angel Reporter) [20] gave no residues having Phi/Psi
angles in the disallowed ranges, and the percentage of
residues having Phi/Psi angles in the most favorable
ranges is around 97-98%, similar to the template structures used. The quality of Ramachandran plots was
satisfactory for all of the models. In the second test, the
stereo/packing for residues of the same type in high
quality experimental structures deposited in the Protein
Data Bank were compared with our HDACs models
using VADAR. A score of < 5.0 or worse usually indicate poor packing. In general, our HDACs models have
similar packing scores compared to the template X-ray
structure. A few residues are poorly packed in these
models based upon scores less than 5, but those residues are not binding ligand domain. In summary, the
quality of our HDACs models has been checked by two
different criteria. The results showed that our models
are reliable for performing further docking studies.
Comparison of the homology model and X-ray structure
of HDAC4

During our homology modeling studies of HDACs, the
X-ray structures of HDAC (PDB ID 1C3P, 1ZZ1,
2VQM, and 3EW8) cocrystallized with several inhibitors
were reported at 1.80 Å, 1.57 Å, 1.80 Å, 1.80 Å resolution, respectively. Comparison of the X-ray structures to
our homology model of Homo sapiens class II HDACs
was an independent way of validating our result. With a
backbone RMSD ≤ 0.5 Å for residues 648-1057 of
HDAC4, 693-1075 of HDAC5, 579-842 of HDAC6, 521942 of HDAC7, 633-1008 of HDAC9, and 40-421 of
HDAC10, the Homo sapiens class II HDACs homology
model is very similar to the X-ray structure 2VQM. The
overall secondary and tertiary structures are very similar
for the model and the X-ray structures.
Docking of SAHA and TSA to HDACs models

To investigate the interaction between Homo sapiens
class II HDAC with inhibitors, we docked SAHA and
TSA to the six homology models. The results for SAHA
and TSA are shown in Figures 3 and 4 while the calculated binding energies are summarized in Table 1. As
expected, SAHA and TSA bind in the active site of
HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC6, HDAC7, HDAC9, and

HDAC10 with a similar pattern. All docked SAHA and
TSA structures have the same orientation as in the Xray structure of the HDAC4-hydroxamic acid cocrystal.
In HDAC4-SAHA and HDAC4-TSA complexes, the catalytic zinc trihedrally coordinates to the side chains of
amino acids Asp193, His195, Asp287 (Figures 3 and 4).
In HDAC5-SAHA and HDAC5-TSA complexes, the catalytic zinc trihedrally coordinates to the side chains of
amino acids Asp178, His180, Asp272. In HDAC6-SAHA
and HDAC6-TSA complexes, the catalytic zinc trihedrally coordinates to the side chains of amino acids
Asp71, His73, Asp164. In HDAC7-SAHA and HDAC7TSA complexes, the catalytic zinc trihedrally coordinates
to the side chains of amino acids Asp191, His193,
Asp285. In HDAC9-SAHA and HDAC9-TSA complexes, the catalytic zinc trihedrally coordinates to the
side chains of amino acids Asp188, His190, Asp282. In
HDAC10-SAHA and HDAC10-TSA complexes, the catalytic zinc trihedrally coordinates to the side chains of
amino acids Asp133, His135, Asp226. Amino acid residues that are involved in binding the catalytic zinc are
highly conserved in class II HDACs. In HDAC4-SAHA,
HDAC5-SAHA, HDAC6-SAHA and HDAC7-SAHA
complexes, SAHA binds the catalytic zinc ion in a
bidentate fashion, with its carbonyl and hydroxyl bound
to catalytic zinc ion. Whereas, in HDAC9-SAHA and
HDAC10-SAHA complexes, SAHA binds the catalytic
zinc ion in a monodentate fashion with its carbonyl
bound to catalytic zinc ion. Except HDAC5-TSA complex, all of Homo sapiens class II HDACs-TSA complexes bind the catalytic zinc ion in a monodentate
fashion. The aberrant monodentate coordination of
SAHA and TSA in the catalytic domain of Homo
sapiens class II HDACs -complexes structures originates
from the different topology of the active site [21]. In
Homo sapiens class II HDACs-SAHA complexes, the
hydroxyl group of SAHA forms hydrogen bonds with
the side chains of two active site histidines, mimicking
the interactions of the water molecule in the active site
of catalytic domain HDAC7 cocrystal. The hydroxyl
group of SAHA replaces the water molecule, which was
found in the active site of catalytic domain HDAC7
cocrystal. In Homo sapiens class II HDACs-TSA complexes, the hydroxyl group of TSA forms hydrogen
bonds with the side chains of two active site histidine
and glycine, mimicking the interactions of the water
molecule in the active site of catalytic domain HDAC7
cocrystal. The hydroxyl group of SAHA replaces the
water molecule, which was found in the active site of
catalytic domain HDAC7 cocrystal [22].
Each ligand showed different affinities with the class II
HDACs; for example, SAHA compound showed the
best affinity with the HDAC 5 (-7.44 kcal/mol) based on
AutoDock calculation and HDAC10 (-263.15 kJ/mol)

energy and the ligand’s internal energy.

based on APBS calculation. Whereas the same compound was found to be rank 2 with HDAC7 (-7.42 kcal/
mol) based on AutoDock calculation and HDAC6
(-213.60 kJ/mol) based on APBS calculation, and rank 3
(-6.72 kcal/mol) with HDAC10 (AutoDock) and HDAC7
(-203.21 kJ/mol, APBS). Local free binding energy
obtained from AutoDock of Homo sapiens class II
HDACs complexed with an inhibitor showed that
SAHA is a weaker inhibitor of HDACs than TSA. But,
global binding energy of Homo sapiens class II HDACs
and inhibitors obtained from APBS, showed that TSA to
be a weaker inhibitor of HDACs than SAHA. There are
differences in binding energy calculated with AutoDock
and APBS; this is because AutoDock does not calculate
columbic contribution from all of atoms in protein like
APBS.
The further descriptor analysis and the toxicity prediction (Tables 2 and 3) helped in the identification of the
better inhibitor. Drug Score and the Drug-Likeness are
the two properties that are important for considering a
compound to become a successful drug. TSA had a
drug score of 0.37 and drug likeness property score of
1.24, which is higher than those for SAHA with respective scores of 0.35 and -8.87 (Table 2). The molecular
weight of SAHA was 264.32 g/mol and that of TSA was
302.37 g/mol (Table 2), between the preferred range of
molecular weight for drug likeness property (160-480 g/
mol). From Table 3, TSA has red color in tumorigenic
property. SAHA was the compound that had the acceptable range (yellow and green colors) for toxicity risk.
These values were also taken into account to decide the
best inhibitor. Thus, SAHA was the best drug candidate
than TSA and also found to possess better global binding affinity score.
The ADME-TOX box results showed that the SAHA
has an oral bioavailability of more than 70% i.e., good
solubility and stability. It acts as a non-substrate and
non-inhibitor of P-gp. SAHA does not undergo significant first-pass metabolism. Although the ability to inhibit P-gp is very important in cancer drug characteristics,

but SAHA still has the possibility to become a candidate
for cervical cancer drug, because cervical tissue is not a
P-gp expressing tissue. The predicted LD 50 values of
SAHA in mouse and rat was found to be 1400 mg/kg
and 1600 mg/kg respectively when administered orally.
SAHA acts as a non-substrate when checked for the Pglycoprotein substrate specificity.

Conclusion
The three-dimensional models for six class II histone
deacetylases (HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC6, HDAC7,
HDAC9, and HDAC10), which were built using homology modeling and validated by bioinformatics techniques and by comparison to an X-ray structures, were
docked to SAHA and TSA. Our studies provide the
structural view of the catalytic domain of a class II
HDAC and reveal for this subclass specific features: (i) a

kJ/mol, -171.77 kJ/mol, -213.60 kJ/mol, -203.21 kJ/mol,
-179.29 kJ/mol & -263.15 kJ/mol respectively, the Drug
Likeness value (1.24) and drug score (0.37) with 70%
oral bioavailability and the carbonyl group of these compounds fits well into the active site of the target where
the zinc is present. Hence, SAHA could be developed as
potential inhibitors of class II HDACs and valuable anticancer-agents.
