Abstract
Background: South America's western coastline, extending in a near-straight line across some 35 latitudinal degrees,
presents an elegant setting for assessing both contemporary and historic influences on cladogenesis in the marine
environment. Southern bull-kelp (Durvillaea antarctica) has a broad distribution along much of the Chilean coast. This
species represents an ideal model taxon for studies of coastal marine connectivity and of palaeoclimatic effects, as it
grows only on exposed rocky coasts and is absent from beaches and ice-affected shores. We expected that, along the
central Chilean coast, D. antarctica would show considerable phylogeographic structure as a consequence of the
isolating effects of distance and habitat discontinuities. In contrast, we hypothesised that further south - throughout
the region affected by the Patagonian Ice Sheet at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) - D. antarctica would show relatively
little genetic structure, reflecting postglacial recolonisation.
Results: Mitochondrial (COI) and chloroplast (rbcL) DNA analyses of D. antarctica from 24 Chilean localities (164
individuals) revealed two deeply divergent (4.5 - 6.1% for COI, 1.4% for rbcL) clades from the centre and south of the
country, with contrasting levels and patterns of genetic structure. Among populations from central Chile (32° - 44°S),
substantial phylogeographic structure was evident across small spatial scales, and a significant isolation-by-distance
effect was observed. Genetic disjunctions in this region appear to correspond to the presence of long beaches. In
contrast to the genetic structure found among central Chilean populations, samples from the southern Chilean
Patagonian region (49° - 56°S) were genetically homogeneous and identical to a haplotype recently found throughout
the subantarctic region.
Conclusions: Southern (Patagonian) Chile has been recolonised by D. antarctica relatively recently, probably since the
LGM. The inferred trans-oceanic ancestry of these Patagonian populations supports the notion that D. antarctica is
capable of long-distance dispersal via rafting. In contrast, further north in central Chile, the correspondence of genetic
disjunctions in D. antarctica with long beaches indicates that habitat discontinuity drives genetic isolation among
established kelp populations. We conclude that rafting facilitates colonisation of unoccupied shores, but has limited
potential to enhance gene-flow among established populations. Broadly, this study demonstrates that some taxa may
be considered to have either high or low dispersal potential across different temporal and geographic scales.
Background
Oceanic ecosystems have historically been considered
relatively open, with high connectivity among populations [1]. Recent studies have, however, demonstrated
considerable population structure in a variety of coastal
taxa (see [2-5]; and references therein), indicating that
connectivity among marine populations is often lower
than previously assumed [4]. Levels of connectivity in

coastal ecosystems may be affected by a broad range of
factors, including oceanography, geological history, habitat continuity, ecology and life history [6]. The relative
importance of these factors in structuring marine populations, however, remains largely unknown [7].
Genetic patterns of isolation-by-distance are common
in the marine realm, with neighbouring populations generally more closely related to each other than to those further away, as the chance of successful dispersal decreases
with increasing distance [3,6]. Gene flow among populations with particularly stringent ecological requirements
may also be impeded by habitat discontinuities [2,8].

Extensive stretches of sandy beach might, for example,
represent important biogeographic hurdles for rockyshore marine taxa, even those with a planktonic larval
stage [7,9-12]. The genetic effects of habitat discontinuities should be greatest among populations of taxa with
relatively low dispersal potential. Indeed, in several species of marine macroalgae with predicted low dispersal
potential, discontinuities in suitable substratum have
been linked to reduced gene flow among populations [1315].
Although most macroalgae have only short-lived gametes or dispersive zygotes, some - particularly highly
buoyant species - are hypothesised to be capable of longdistance dispersal via rafting of fertile adults (e.g., Fucus
vesiculosus: [16]; Hormosira banksii: [17]; Macrocystis
pyrifera: [18]). A broad-scale phylogeographic study of
one such species, southern bull-kelp (Durvillaea antarctica), found evidence of recent (postglacial) recolonisation of much of the subantarctic, a feat almost certainly
achieved by trans-oceanic rafting of adult specimens [19].
Recolonisation of the subantarctic was inferred from
extremely low levels of genetic structure among bull-kelp
populations throughout this region, versus high levels of
genetic structure in glacial refugia (e.g., New Zealand).
Low levels of genetic structure of populations in historically glaciated regions, versus relatively high structure in
unglaciated regions, is a signature of postglacial recolonisation that has been demonstrated in a wide range of
marine and terrestrial taxa (reviewed by [20-24]). But if
bull-kelp is able to disperse over long distances by rafting,
how is high genetic structure maintained in refugial
regions? Fraser et al. [19] suggested that the genetic
structure observed in refugial areas may be largely a consequence of the density-blocking effects of established
populations [20,25]. In dense kelp populations, any limited available substratum is more likely to be colonised by
zygotes from residents rather than those from rare, rafted
individuals. Phylogeographic structure within refugial
areas may therefore be driven more through isolation-bydistance, or breaks in habitat continuity, than by rafting
dispersal. Rafting may, in contrast, enable long-distance
dispersal and colonisation of unoccupied habitats.
Chile presents an intriguing system for assessing the
relative phylogeographic impacts of isolation-by-distance, habitat discontinuities, and historic glaciations.
Central Chile has an almost straight coastline characterised by numerous extensive stretches of beach that isolate
rocky-shore habitats [8]; this coast was largely unaffected
by ice during the Pleistocene glaciations [26]. Further
south, Chilean Patagonian shores also form isolated habitats of islands and peninsulas, but at the Last Glacial
Maximum (LGM), an extensive ice sheet covered most of
this region [27,28] (Fig. 1). This glacial ice probably
extended westward to the edge of the continental shelf

[28], and likely extirpated many populations of rocky
shore taxa. Such contrasts in geological history between
central and Patagonian Chile should be reflected in the
phylogeographic structure of taxa occurring across both
regions. Durvillaea antarctica currently dominates the
rocky shores of Chile from Cape Horn [29], at around
56°S, up to approximately 32°S [8]. Fraser et al.'s [19]
recent broadscale study of D. antarctica included few
samples from central Chile (only seven localities), and
none from Chilean Patagonia, and was therefore unable
to assess phylogeographic contrasts along the Chilean
coast. For the current study, we analysed samples from a
total of 24 localities, encompassing the full range of D.
antarctica in Chile, to test the predictions that (i) D. antarctica populations in central Chile would show strong
phylogeographic structure, and that (ii) D. antarctica
populations in southern Chile would show little genetic
structure, reflecting postglacial recolonisation.

Results
DNA sequencing of 164 D. antarctica samples from 24
localities along the coast of Chile yielded 14 distinct haplotypes for mitochondrial COI, with 34 variable sites
detected across the 629 bp fragment. For a chloroplast

marker, rbcL, 78 sequences from nine localities (six in
central Chile: Table 1) yielded two haplotypes, with 12
variable sites across the 886 bp fragment. Twenty-seven
of the 34 variable COI nucleotide sites were third-codon
positions, and transitions accounted for most inferred
changes, with transversions inferred at only three sites for
COI, and at one site for rbcL. As no genetic diversity for
rbcL was observed in 54 samples from six widely-spaced
central Chilean localities, obtaining rbcL sequences for all
samples for this region was deemed redundant, and only
a subset of samples were analysed for this less-informative marker.
Phylogenetic analyses of COI revealed that 13 of the D.
antarctica haplotypes in Chile (C-II to C-XIV) were
restricted to populations in central Chile, whereas all
sampled Chilean Patagonian populations south of 44°S
were fixed for a single haplotype (C-I), which was highly
divergent from the others (Fig. 2). The widespread
Patagonian haplotype, C-I, was previously detected at
numerous subantarctic locations throughout the Southern Hemisphere [19] (Fig. 3). With the exception of the
Patagonian haplotype (C-I), all (central) Chilean haplotypes (C-II - C-XIV) were closely related to one another
(uncorrected distances 0.2 - 1.3%), together forming a
strongly supported clade (Bayesian PP 1.00; Fig. 2a); by
contrast, the Patagonian haplotype (C-I) was markedly
divergent from all other Chilean haplotypes (C-II - CXIV) (uncorrected distances 4.5 - 6.1%). The two chloroplast (rbcL) haplotypes detected in Chile were 1.4% divergent (uncorrected distance), with one (R-I) restricted to
all sampled Patagonian populations, and the other (R-II)
found only in central Chile (Cucao, Punta Loncoyen,
Tumbes, Constitución, Montemar and Pichicuy). More
broadly, the Patagonian rbcL haplotype R-I has a circumsubantarctic distribution, including the Falkland Islands
and South Georgia (not shown; [19]).
Network analyses of Chilean COI haplotypes recovered
two parsimonious networks that could not be joined at
≥90% confidence limits, with one comprising only the
Patagonian haplotype C-I. All other Chilean haplotypes
(CII-CXIV) formed a single network (Fig. 3 shows these
networks in the context of previously-published work
[19]).

The Mantel test revealed a significant relationship
between genetic and geographic distance (P = 0.015 for
999 permutations) (Fig. 4). Detailed geographic analyses
based on maximum uninterrupted beach length between
pairs of adjacent sampling locations in central Chile
revealed a clear relationship between rocky shore habitat
continuity and genetic connectivity along the central
Chilean coast (Fig. 5). Under the definition of genetic disjunction corresponding to Nei's D ≥1.0, no 'disjunct'
locality pairs shared any haplotypes. Notably, all phylogeographic disjunctions in central Chilean D. antarctica
were associated with extensive (> 20 km) beaches (Fig. 5).
The only adjacent locality pair separated by a beach > 20
km long that did not show a genetic disjunction was
Lebu/Tirua (locality pair J in Fig. 5), separated by 62 km
of uninterrupted beach. Logistic regression (with the
binomial response variable of 'genetically disjunct or not',
and the continuous fixed effects 'maximum beach length
between adjacent localities' and 'coastal distance between
adjacent localities') revealed that maximum beach length
was a significant predictor of genetic disjunction (β =
0.05; P = 0.035; N = 15), whereas total coastal distance
was not (β = 0.01; P = 0.608; N = 15). The outlier formed
by Lebu/Tirua (locality pair J, Fig. 5) is, however, likely
having a strong effect on the analysis; indeed, removing
this locality pair from the analyses greatly strengthens the
effect of long beaches in the logistic regression (β = 0.23;
P = 0.002; N = 14). With or without the outlier, these
results indicate that habitat discontinuity influences
genetic connectivity among populations of central Chilean bull-kelp.

Discussion
Two broad findings were revealed by our phylogeographic research of D. antarctica in Chile. First, substantial phylogeographic structure was observed in central
Chile (hypothesis i). Genetic isolation among populations
in this region appears driven by habitat discontinuities.
Second, and in direct contrast to the pattern observed for
central Chile, samples from Chilean Patagonia showed
complete genetic homogeneity within and among localities (hypothesis ii). These Patagonian populations were
deeply divergent to those from more northern (central

Chilean) localities, and appear to have trans-oceanic
ancestry.
Habitat discontinuity and population connectivity in
central Chile

The substantial phylogeographic structure observed
among central Chilean sampling localities of D. antarctica (Fig. 2) suggests a low level of genetic connectivity
across this region (hypothesis i), a finding supported by
the significant results of the isolation-by-distance test.
Furthermore, the strong relationship between long
beaches and genetic disjunctions in D. antarctica (Fig. 5)
suggests that habitat discontinuity is likely a major factor
controlling local genetic connectivity in this rocky-shore
macroalga. Population connectivity of other kelp species
may be similarly affected by interruptions in habitat:
Faugeron et al. [15], for example, demonstrated genetic
differentiation among populations of the kelp Lessonia
nigrescens in northern Chile across a habitat discontinu-

ity formed by a mine-waste disposal site. In the English
Channel, Billot et al. [13] found evidence for reduced
gene flow among populations of the kelp Laminaria digitata across habitat discontinuities. Patterns of genetic
disjunction associated with habitat discontinuity have
also been noted for numerous rock-dwelling taxa with
predicted high dispersal abilities, including rocky-reef
fish [7,11], rock-pool copepods [9], and macroalgae (e.g.,
small-scale patterns of genetic structure in Phyllospora
[12]), suggesting that for marine taxa, as observed for terrestrial plants [30,31], dispersive life history alone does
not necessarily lead to panmixia.
That habitat discontinuity appears to disrupt connectivity among central Chilean populations of D. antarctica
is in direct contrast to the broad evidence of long-distance, trans-oceanic dispersal of this species in the subantarctic [19]. Several biological factors may help to
explain such a contrast in apparent dispersal ability/effectiveness. First, established and dense kelp populations

Although the 'Patagonian/subantarctic' and 'New Zealand south' clades [19] joined parsimoniously using network analysis, the 'central Chilean' clade did not join to any other lineages at ≥90% confidence limit: a hypothetical, non-statistically supported connection between the major clades is indicated with a red dashed line.

may resist genetic input from rafted individuals [19] in a
form of density-blocking [20,25]. In such populations,
limited substratum availability and high competition
from local D. antarctica zygotes would suppress settlement of zygotes from such migrants. Conversely, shores
swept clean by ice [19] or other large-scale disturbances
would offer ample settlement opportunities for zygotes
from rafted migrants. Although the genetic effects of
density-blocking have yet to be demonstrated experimentally for brown algae, the complete genetic homogeneity
of putative postglacially-recolonised populations (this
study and [19]), and the absence of the Patagonian COI
haplotype (CI) from central Chilean populations, indicate
that such a process is likely to be occurring. Second,

although D. antarctica is clearly an effective long-distance disperser, there may be differences in reproductive
viability of rafts across latitudinal gradients. Numerous
reports suggest that D. antarctica has an extended period
of fertility in the subantarctic versus mainland New Zealand or Chile (see references in [29]), perhaps facilitated
by longer optimal reproductive conditions in colder
waters. Observations by Macaya et al. [18] suggest that
detached rafts of another kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, lose
reproductive activity at high temperatures, a finding supported by Rothäusler et al. [32]. If D. antarctica rafts are
similarly affected by high water temperatures, fewer
zygotes from immigrant individuals may be available to

colonise central Chile than in the relatively cold waters of
Chilean Patagonia (Fig. 1).
Local genetic structure within and among central Chilean D. antarctica populations could additionally be influenced by a range of processes such as seasonal variation
and patchy recruitment [33] or harvesting [34-36]. While
the results from Bustamante & Castilla [35] and Castilla
et al. [36] underline the importance of short-distance dispersal in local population dynamics, coastal islands might
serve as stepping stones allowing dispersal across long
stretches of sandy beaches. Indeed, the only locality pair
separated by a long beach that did not show a genetic disjunction (Lebu-Tirua) is in the immediate vicinity of a
large coastal island (Isla Mocha) that may effectively connect the two populations despite the beach barrier. Interestingly, Constitución, flanked by long beaches on both
sides, was genetically distinct from adjacent localities but
not from some more distant localities (Cartagena, Montemar and Pichicuy). These populations, on the northernmost edge of the range of D. antarctica in Chile, may be
sensitive to any changes in water temperature. Changes
to the northern range limit of an Australian congeneric,
D. potatorum, have been linked to warming waters in
recent years [37]. The northern populations of D. antarctica in Chile (Cartagena, Montemar and Pichicuy) may
thus be somewhat ephemeral in the long term, and could
have been relatively recently colonised by kelp drifting
from southern populations (e.g., Constitución) in the
north-flowing Humboldt Current.
Major genetic disjunction in southern Chile

Our phylogeographic analyses of Chilean D. antarctica
populations indicate a biogeographic break in northern
Chilean Patagonia (44° - 49°S), with both mitochondrial
and chloroplast DNA phylogenies revealing a deep
genetic disjunction between samples from southern
Patagonia and those from central Chile (Fig. 2). Although
the precise geographic location of this major genetic disjunction cannot be pinpointed with this present dataset, a

Page 7 of 12

biogeographic break in the vicinity of the Golfo de Penas/
Taitao Peninsula (46.5°S; Fig. 2) has previously been
noted [38,39]. More recently, Lancellotti and Vásquez
[40] suggested this feature may represent the southern
boundary of the transitional zone, separating it from the
cold-temperate southern waters south of 46°S. The
hypothesis of a biogeographic break at Taitao Peninsula
has been supported by several recent shallow-marine surveys of Cnidaria in southern Chile [41,42], with samples
showing distinct changes in species composition to the
north and south of about 46°S. In a recent study of the
density of drifting kelp in channels north of Taitao Peninsula, Hinojosa et al. [43] suggest that D. antarctica rafts
are driven by both surface currents (primarily westward)
and wind (primarily eastward) through the fiords. Taitao
Peninsula, however, projects across the dense system of
channels that could otherwise potentially allow mixing
and north-south transport of drifting D. antarctica
within the fiords.
The deep genetic disjunction between D. antarctica
samples from southern Patagonia and those from central
Chile raises the question of the taxonomic status of these
two divergent lineages. A recent study of D. antarctica
revealed that this taxon comprises two ecologically, morphologically and genetically distinct forms in New Zealand [44]. Given that the genetic disjunction between
Patagonian and central Chilean D. antarctica (4.5 - 6.1%
for COI) exceeds the divergence observed between the
co-occurring, genetically-distinct forms in New Zealand
(3.0 - 3.8% for COI: [44]), it is possible that the distinct
Chilean lineages represent reproductively-isolated species, and future studies should assess any physiological,
ecological or life history differences between them.
Regardless, the phylogeographic contrasts between these
lineages are intriguing, with negligible genetic structure
observed throughout sampled Patagonian populations (a
single haplotype for COI at all five localities across some
1000 km of shoreline), versus high structure further north
(eleven COI haplotypes across approximately 1400 km).
Postglacial recolonisation of coastal Chilean Patagonia

The complete genetic homogeneity observed in D. antarctica from all localities south of latitude 44°S (the
region covered by the Patagonian Ice Sheet at the LGM:
Fig. 1), compared with substantial phylogeographic structure among populations in central Chile for COI (Fig. 2),
strongly supports a hypothesis of postglacial recolonisation of Chilean Patagonia (hypothesis ii). Such events are
typically marked by low levels of genetic structure in
recolonised versus refugial areas (reviewed by [20-24])
although, to date, few studies have been carried out in the
Southern Hemisphere [45]. Recolonisation of Patagonia
appears to have occurred from a trans-oceanic source,
rather than from geographically proximate areas in cen-

tral Chile. The Patagonian COI haplotype C-I also occurs
on numerous subantarctic islands (Fig. 3, and see [19]),
and is more closely related to haplotypes found in the
New Zealand subantarctic region than to other Chilean
haplotypes [19], suggesting the New Zealand region as a
source, with transport facilitated by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (Fig. 1) [46-49].
Although genetic evidence of postglacial recolonisation
has previously been identified from a variety of Patagonian terrestrial and freshwater taxa, including fish (galaxiids: [50-52]; percichthyids: [53,54]), lizards [55], and
plants [56-58], this is the first study to reveal evidence of
postglacial recolonisation of a Chilean Patagonian marine
taxon (but see recent findings on the likely impacts of glacial cycles on marine dispersal by diadromous fish in
Patagonia [51]). Additionally, in comparison with Fraser
et al. [19], who inferred recolonisation of several subantarctic islands by Durvillaea after extirpation by sea ice,
this work shows that the glacial (i.e., land-based) ice during the most recent ice age may also have driven kelp
population extinctions. If populations of D. antarctica in
southern Chile were indeed destroyed by the Patagonian
Ice Sheet during the last glacial period, numerous other
coastal taxa may have been similarly affected. Intriguingly, a broad-scale phylogeographic study of the rockyshore gastropod Concholepas concholepas [59], found no
evidence of recent (post-LGM) recolonisation of Chilean
Patagonia. Perhaps the habitat of this molluscan species,
extending to 40 m below sea level [60], enabled it to survive throughout the last ice age in regions where more
intertidally-restricted taxa were eliminated by ice. Future
studies should aim to assess whether a pattern of postglacial recolonisation is common among other subtidal and
intertidal species in southern Chile.

Conclusions
Our understanding of evolutionary processes relies
largely on our knowledge of the factors that drive and
maintain genetic variation and population connectivity.
Marine systems can present paradoxical patterns of
genetic connectivity, with taxa that apparently have low
intrinsic dispersal capacities occasionally showing
broader geographic ranges than highly dispersive taxa
[61-63]. In such cases, passive dispersal by rafting may
explain the broad distributions of otherwise non-dispersive species [64]. The results of the current study suggest
that some taxa cannot necessarily be classified as either
'high' or 'low' dispersal organisms, and that mechanisms
of dispersal may vary across temporal and geographic
scales. Bull-kelp (D. antarctica) is capable of long-distance dispersal via rafting of fertile adults, as evidenced
by the trans-oceanic ancestry of populations throughout
postglacially-recolonised Chilean Patagonia (and subantarctic islands [19]). Intriguingly, this dispersal capacity

facilitates colonisation of as-yet unoccupied rocky shores,
but does not enhance connectivity among established
populations. Long-established populations, such as those
along the coast of central Chile, seem strongly influenced
by the isolating effects of geographic distance and habitat
discontinuities, indicating relatively poor inter-population connectivity.

Methods
Sample collection, DNA extraction and sequencing

164 samples of D. antarctica were collected from 24
localities along the coast of Chile, from Pichicuy
(32°27'37"S) to Cape Horn (55°59'31"S) (Fig. 2, Table 1).
These localities encompassed most of the Chilean range
of this species, which extends from Los Vilos (31°54'27"S;
60 km north of Pichicuy) to Cape Horn. The data from
seven of the localities in Chile (Cucao, Bahia Mansa,
Punta Loncoyen, Tumbes, Constitución, Montemar and
Pichicuy) were included in previously published analyses
[19] but are here reanalyzed in-depth in the light of
extensive additional sampling (106 new samples from 17
new localities). Samples consisted of small (< 2 cm2)
pieces of tissue cut from the tip of healthy fronds of
attached D. antarctica, and were preserved by desiccation
in either 96% ethanol or silica gel beads. DNA extraction,
amplification, purification and sequencing were performed as described in Fraser et al. [44]. A 629 bp region
of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) was
amplified using primers GazF1 and GazR1 [65] for all
samples. In addition, an 886 bp region of chloroplast rbcL
was amplified using primers KL2 and KL8 [66] for samples from three localities in Chilean Patagonia, and analysed with previously-published sequences from central
Chile (Pichicuy, Montemar, Constitución, Tumbes, Punta
Loncoyen and Cucao) (Table 1).
Analyses

Phylogenies for each DNA dataset were constructed
using maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian analyses,
and included outgroup sequences from Durvillaea willana (South Island, New Zealand; GenBank accessions:
EU918569 for COI and EU918578 for rbcL), Durvillaea
potatorum (Tathra, southeastern Australia; GenBank
accessions: FJ873092 for COI and FJ872990 for rbcL) and
Fucus (GenBank accessions: F. vesiculosus AY494079 for
COI and F. gardneri AF195515 for rbcL). To place the new
Chilean sequence data in a wider context, published D.
antarctica DNA sequences (GenBank accessions
FJ550086 - FJ550112[19]) from seven of the localities in
central Chile, and numerous localities around the subantarctic and New Zealand, were included in the analyses
(Fig. 2). Note that the unique COI and rbcL haplotypes
reported from the Crozet Islands by Fraser et al. [19] were
later found to be erroneous, and were in fact identical to

Fraser et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:203
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/203

the widespread haplotypes C-I and R-I; this error was
corrected for the present analyses. ML analyses were performed using PhyML [67] with a TrN + I [68] model for
both COI and rbcL (proportion of invariable sites estimated, Nst = 6) as selected by the AIC of Modeltest 3.06
[69]. Node support was estimated by bootstrapping [70],
with heuristic analysis of 1000 replicate data sets (Fig. 2).
Bayesian posterior probability (PP) values were calculated
using MRBAYES 3.1.2 [71] and are shown on the ML
phylogenies (Fig. 2). Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC)
searches were performed, with four chains of 5,000,000
generations and trees sampled every 100. The first 10,000
trees sampled were discarded as 'burn-in,' as determined
using Tracer v1.4 [72], while a consensus topology and
posterior probability values were calculated with the
remaining trees. Unrooted statistical parsimony networks
were built using TCS 1.21 [73]. All unique DNA
sequences obtained during this study were deposited
with GenBank (accession numbers for all Chilean D. antarctica COI and rbcL sequences used in this study:
FJ550093-FJ550095; FJ550097; FJ550099; FJ550119;
HM103936-HM104173).
Analysis of isolation-by-distance was performed on
data from the 19 localities in central Chile (north of 44°S)
via the Mantel [74] test, implemented in GenAlEx6 [75],
using raw (D) average pairwise differences [76] (calculated using Arlequin version 3.0 [77]) versus coastal distance (not including deep bays with narrow, <
approximately 2 km, openings) among sample localities.
Linearised population pairwise FST values could not be
used in the Mantel test: several localities were genetically
monomorphic for different haplotypes, and pairwise
comparisons between such fixed populations gave an FST
of 1.0; hence for these locality pairs no linearised FST values (FST/(1 - FST), [78]) could be calculated.
Approximate measurements of the lengths of all
beaches (coastal stretches of uninterrupted sand, gravel
or pebbles) between pairs of adjacent rocky coastal localities in central Chile were made using the 'path ruler' tool
in Google Earth http://earth.google.com/ to assess the
continuity of suitable rocky shore habitat for D. antarctica among localities. As Chilean shores south of about
43°S are almost completely rocky, with few sandy beaches
and, moreover, many wide oceanic channels between
islands and peninsulas, measurements of beaches were
only made for continental Chile and the coast of the
Great Island of Chiloé (north of 43°S). The following
analysis was performed only on data from sampled localities in this region (Pichichuy, at 32° 20', to Cucao, at
42°40' S). The isolating effects of beach length and total
coastal distance between localities in central Chile were
assessed by logistic regression. Adjacent locality pairs
were first classified binomially as either genetically dis-

Page 10 of 12

junct (D ≥1.0) or not (D < 1.0). Under this definition,
locality pairs not sharing any haplotypes were considered
genetically disjunct, whereas those with shared haplotypes were not considered disjunct. Logistic regression
was then carried out using R [79], using the logistf add-on
package, with the model: 'genetically disjunct' ~ 'maximum beach length between adjacent localities' + 'coastal
distance between adjacent localities'. This analysis
enabled assessment of the relative abilities of total coastal
distance, versus beach length, to predict whether or not
adjacent localities were genetically disjunct.
