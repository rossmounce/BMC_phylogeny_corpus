Abstract
Background: Metabolism is believed to adaptively shape-shift with changing environment. In
recent years, a structural difference with respect to temperature, which is an environmental factor,
has been revealed in metabolic networks, implying that metabolic networks transit with
temperature. Subsequently, elucidatation of the origin of these structural differences due to
temperature is important for understanding the evolution of life. However, the origin has yet to be
clarified due to the complexity of metabolic networks.
Results: Consequently, we propose a simple model with a few parameters to explain the
transitions. We first present mathematical solutions of this model using mean-field approximation,
and demonstrate that this model can reproduce structural properties, such as heterogeneous
connectivity and hierarchical modularity, in real metabolic networks both qualitatively and
quantitatively. We next show that the model parameters correlate with optimal growth
temperature. In addition, we present a relationship between multiple cyclic properties and optimal
growth temperature in metabolic networks.
Conclusion: From the proposed model, we find that such structural properties are determined
by the emergence of a short-cut path, which reduces the minimum distance between two nodes
on a graph. Furthermore, we investigate correlations between model parameters and growth
temperature; as a result, we find that the emergence of the short-cut path tends to be inhibited
with increasing temperature. In addition, we also find that the short-cut path bypasses a relatively
long path at high temperature when the emergence of the new path is not inhibited. Even further,
additional network analysis provides convincing evidence of the reliability of the proposed model
and its conclusions on the possible origins of differences in metabolic network structure.

Background
Elucidation of basic design principles behind biological
systems is a central topic in the post-genomic era. In particular, it is important to understand the cell's adaptation
to environmental changes in not only evolutionary biology but also biotechnology. It is believed that most posi-

tively selected mutations cause changes in metabolism,
resulting in a better-adapted phenotype from natural history, phylogenetics, genetics, and so on. This is an adaptive evolution. Adaptation to temperature is often
discussed when considering the evolution of life, because
molecular phylogenetic analyses [1-3] support that organPage 1 of 13

isms living at high temperatures are primeval forms of life.
Moreover, heat-loving organisms have a great deal of
potential in industry. They provide product materials with
poise because they are very stable at normal temperatures.
In addition, heat-loving organisms are cost-effective
because we can utilize them repetitively due to their stability. Thus, elucidation of differences with respect to temperature and their origin is a major topic in several areas
of biology.

in networks. In the case of a large degree exponent, the
probability that a node with large degree exists in a network becomes low. That is, most nodes have similar
degrees in the networks, indicating that the connectivity
of the network is homogeneous. In the case of a small
degree exponent, in contrast, nodes tend to have different
degrees in the networks, suggesting that the connectivity
of the network is heterogeneous, and therefore it is statistically possible to find highly connected nodes or hubs.

Living organisms optimally grow in environments of different temperatures. For example, humans optimally grow
in a particular temperature, and cannot grow at very high
temperatures. However, heat-loving organisms such as
Methanopyrus kandleri and Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis optimally grow at high temperatures. In general, living
organisms are classified into four classes [4]: Hyperthermophiles (extreme heat-loving), Thermophiles (heat-loving), Mesophiles (grow at moderate temperatures) and
Psychrophiles (cold-loving).

The small-world property is reflected in high clustering
coefficients C [10], which denote the density of edges
between neighbors of a given node, and implies the modularity of networks [16]. The modular structures are
actively investigated with statistical approaches, and it is
found that the degree-dependent clustering coefficient,
defined as a correlation between the number of edges k of
a given node and the clustering coefficient C of the node,
follows the power law with exponent -1; thus C(k) ∝ k-1.
The power-law function suggests modules themselves also
form a hierarchical structure [12,17].

Up until now, several works have revealed adaptive differences, as a result of temperature, for structural and
sequence properties of transcriptomes and proteomes [5].
For example, guanine-cytosine content correlates with
growth temperature in ribonucleic acids (RNAs), and
charged residues tend to exist in proteins of thermophiles.
In particular, such differences at the transcriptome and
proteome level might influence metabolism because proteins play roles of many different enzymes in metabolic
reactions. Therefore, we can expect a structural difference
in metabolic networks with respect to temperature.
The structure of the metabolic networks for many organisms has recently been investigated. We can obtain a large
amount of data on metabolic pathways in many organisms from several databases such as KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes [6]. For large-scale networks
such as metabolic networks, the structural features were
analyzed using statistical mechanics and graph-theoretical
techniques [7,8]. In particular, several striking structural
properties have recently been found such as heterogeneous connectivity [9], small-worlds [10,11], and hierarchical modularity [12]. These properties are absent in
random networks [13].
The heterogeneous connectivity is in the degree distribution, defined as the frequency of nodes with k edges,
which follows the power law P (k) ∝ k-γ, where γ is a constant, and is empirically found to vary from network to
network [7,8,14,15]. This power-law distribution indicates that a few nodes (hubs) integrate a great number of
nodes and most of the remaining nodes do not. In addition, the exponent γ which is the so-called "degree exponent", reflects a macroscopic tendency of the connectivity

In recent years, the relationship between such structural
properties and optimal growth temperature in metabolic
networks has been investigated, and as a result, the structural difference with respect to temperature has been
revealed [18]. With increasing tempoerature, the edge
density (the ratio of the number of edges to the number of
nodes) and the clustering coefficient decrease, and the
degree exponent increases. This result implies that metabolic networks transit from heterogeneous and highly
clustered (highly modular) structures to homogeneous
and less clustered (low modular) structures with increasing temperature. Moreover, the authors have speculated
that this structural transition is due to the difference in
selective constraints between thermophiles and non-thermophiles [19,20]. However, an assuredness of this
hypothesis still not has been shown because of the
unclear relationship between the differences in selective
constraints and that of resulting structural properties. That
is, it is unclear how the difference in selective constrains
affects local evolutionary events and consequently influences global network structure. In order to show a more
concrete hypothesis, we need to clarify what mechanisms
(local rules) determine such structural properties, and
need to reveal the relationship between the mechanisms
and growth temperature. Consequently, we propose a network model which reproduces the structural properties
such as the degree distribution and the degree-dependent
clustering coefficient of metabolic networks. Network
models are useful to reveal the relationship between local
events (microscopic rules) and global (macroscopic) features (structural properties) [7,15]. We try to discuss the
origin of structural differences with respect to temperature
via the proposed model.

In this paper, we first explain the details of the proposed
model with two parameters. We provide mathematical
solutions of the model, and explain how to estimate the
parameters from real data (see Method for details). Moreover, in order to confirm that the model reproduces structural properties, we compare the model with the real
metabolic networks of 113 organisms that were investigated in reference [18]. We next investigate the correlation
between the parameters and growth temperature, and
present a more concrete hypothesis for the origin of structural differences in metabolic networks with respect to
temperature. In addition, we investigate a relationship
between cyclic properties and temperature in metabolic
networks in order to show more convincing evidence of
this hypothesis.

Results
Network model
Here, we propose a simple model, which reproduces
structural properties of metabolic networks, with two
parameters p and q.

In general, metabolic networks are believed to evolve via
gene duplications [21-23] and horizontal gene transfer
[24]. Gene duplication is a process in which multiple copies of a DNA fragment emerge in a genome due to mistakes such as DNA replication errors. Horizontal gene
transfer is any process in which an organism transfers
genetic material to another cell. As a result, these processes
often provide new proteins. For this reason, gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer are believed to play
major roles in evolution [25,26]. Due to these processes,
new reactions often emerge in metabolic networks
because proteins play the roles of many types of enzymes.
Therefore, metabolic networks are believed to grow via
gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer. In this
case, we can consider two situations: the case that a new
metabolite develops and a corresponding new reaction
occurs between it and an existing metabolite (Event I),
and the case that a new reaction occurs between existing
metabolites (Event II). Here, we assume that a network
has a connected component. That is, we do not consider
situations that an isolated node connects to an isolated
cluster. This is because structural differences are observed
in the largest connected components in real metabolic
networks. We neglect such situations according to this
experimental condition.
Moreover, duplicated proteins might be functionally similar to an original protein. That is, a duplicated enzyme
(protein) might catalyze a reaction which is similar to a
reaction catalyzed by an original enzyme (protein). Therefore, it is believed that duplicated pairs of enzymes are
close to each other in metabolic networks [21,23].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/2/82

In consideration of the above, we construct a model as follows.
(i) With probability 1 - p, Event I occurs [see Figure 1(a)].
In this case, a new node [the black node in Figure 1(a)] is
connected to a randomly selected existing node [the gray
node in Figure 1(a)].
(ii) With probability p, Event II occurs [see Figures 1(b)
and 1(c)]. In this case, a short-cut path bypasses a path
between a node and another node. We need to consider
the length of the path bypassed. However, when we investigate the degree distribution and the degree-dependent
clustering coefficient, it is sufficient to consider only two
cases: (1) the case of length 2 and (2) the case that the
length is greater than 2. This assumption (of considering
only two cases) is appropriate because the degree distribution is independent of the bypassed path length and the
clustering coefficient is only influenced in the case that a
path of length 2 is bypassed (see the section "Mathematical solution" in Method for details). Therefore, we express
the bypassed path length using the parameter q as follows.
First, an initial node [the red nodes in Figures 1(b) and
1(c)] is selected at random.
(1) With probability q, next, we select a path of length 2
to bypass based on a random walk from the initial node.

nodes are existing nodes, which are selected by a random
walk from each red node. The new edge becomes a shortcut path between the red node and the green node.

(2) With probability 1 - q, in contrast, we select a path to
bypass whose length is greater than 2 based on a random
walk from the initial node.

Using mean-field approximation, we can obtain mathematical solutions of the model's degree distribution,
degree-dependent clustering coefficient, and average clustering coefficient, which were observed to depend on temperature in Reference [18]. The details are described in the
Method section.
Comparison between the model and real networks
Here, we compare structural properties between the proposed model and the real metabolic networks of 113
organisms (used in [18]), where ubiquitous metabolites
such as water, NH3, and ATP are excluded from use in
analysis. These metabolic networks are represented by
undirected graphs in which nodes and edges correspond
to metabolites and substrate-product relationships,
respectively (see Method for details). We first obtained the
parameters p and q from the metabolic network of each
organism using Equations (14) and (17), respectively.
Substituting the parameters into the mathematical solutions [Equations (4), (10), and (11)], which are shown in
Method, we next obtain structural properties from this
model.

Figure 2 shows a comparison of the degree distribution
between our model and real metabolic networks. We provide P (k) for four organisms, which are selected from
each temperature class. We let the horizontal axis be k +
A(p) to enhance clarity.
Figure 3 shows a comparison of the degree exponent
between our model and real metabolic networks. For
comparison, the degree exponents are obtained by the
maximum likelihood method considering a cutoff, which
is the term A(p) (see Method for details). Note that this is
different from the original maximum likelihood method
[27] which does not include the coefficient A(p). For this
reason, the observed values in Figure 3 are higher than
that in Reference [18].

Thus, the parameter q roughly reflects the degree of the

order to model the feature that duplicated pairs of

Finally, a new edge (short-cut path) is drawn between the
initial node [the red nodes in Figures 1(b) and 1(c)] and

from real data, further validating the reliability of our

Relationship between model parameters and structural
measures
In this section, we investigate a correlation between
model parameters (p and q) and structural measures of
metabolic networks in order to reveal the relationship
between them.

parameters and structural measures.

Each value denotes a Pearson's correlation coefficient. An adjacent value in parenthesis indicates a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. The
mark * by a correlation coefficient means that the P -value for the correlation is less than 0.001. Note that the degree exponent γ is obtained from
Reference [18].

The degree exponent γ has a strong negative correlation
with the parameter p and a very weak correlation with the
parameter q, implying that the degree exponent is dominantly influenced by the parameter p. This result is consistent with our analytical model [see Equation (5)]. On
the other hand, the clustering coefficient correlates with
both parameters p and q, being in agreement with our
model [see Equations (10) and (11)].
In addition, we can observe a correlation between the
degree exponent and the clustering coefficient. This correlation is due to the parameter p which indicates the mechanism: the emergence of short-cut paths. The degree
exponent and the clustering coefficient reflect heterogenous connectivity and modularity, respectively. That is,
this result suggests that these different structural properties, which are notably observed in metabolic networks,
emerge via the same mechanism.
Hypothesis from our model
In the previous two sections, we have shown that our
model could reproduce real metabolic networks from
diversified viewpoints. Therefore, we believe our model to
be reliable, and we expect that we can discuss the origin of
the structural difference in metabolic networks with
respect to temperature via a correlation between the
model parameters and optimal growth temperature.

Figures 7 and 8 show the negative correlation between
temperature and the respective parameters p and q [see
Additional file 1 for the parameters of each organism].
From this result, we speculate on the origin of structural
difference with respect to temperature as follows.
In our model, the parameter p means the appearance frequency of the short-cut path between existing nodes. That
is, the decay of the parameter p with temperature indicates

that the emergence of the short-cut paths is inhibited at
high temperature. This might be caused by strong selective
constraints (negative selection) at high temperature
[19,20].
The parameter q describes the length of bypassed path. A
small value of q indicates that the bypassed path length is
long. Therefore, the negative correlation between the
parameter q and temperature implies that the short-cut
path bypasses a relatively long path at high temperature.
Cyclic properties in metabolic networks with respect to
temperature
In the previous section, we obtained the following
hypotheses from our model (based on the parameters p
and q).

(i) The emergence of short-cut paths tends to be inhibited
at high temperature.

Parameter p

As shown in this table, there is a weak correlation between
the parameters p and q. The parameters p and q control the
emergence of short-cut paths and the length of a bypassed
path, respectively. That is, this weak correlation implies
that these mechanisms are virtually independent, suggesting the necessity of both mechanisms in the model.

increases with increasing temperature.

(ii) However, when such a short-cut path does in fact
emerge, the short-cut path is a bypass of a relatively long
path at high temperature.
In order to show more convincing evidence of these
hypotheses and therefore higher reliability of the model,
here we investigate a relationship between cyclic properties of the metabolic networks and temperature. Since a
cycle is generated due to the emergence of short-cut paths
in our model, we can construe this hypothesis as

As above, the structural properties predicted from our
model are also observed in real metabolic networks. This
result implies more convincing evidence of our hypotheses and therefore higher reliability of the model.

If our model is reliable, then we can observe these structural (cyclic) properties in real metabolic networks.
In order to investigate cyclic properties, we used the following metrics inspired by Reference [30]: the cycle index
Όrc΍ and the cycle length index Όrl΍ (see Method for details).
A high cycle index Όrc΍ indicates a high frequency of cycles
in a network. A high cycle length index Όrl΍ means that the
length of cycles tends to be short in a network (note that
this does not depend on the frequency of cycles).

Discussion
We have proposed a simple model, which can reproduce
the structural properties of real metabolic networks as
shown in Figures 2, 3, 4, 5.
From this model, we have found that the structure of metabolic networks is determined by the emergence of shortcut paths. Our model contends that the emergence of the
short-cut path is a possible origin of preferential attachment. Note that we do not directly use the preferential
attachment. Although preferential attachment in metabolic networks has been revealed [31], its origin still not
has been clarified. We believe that the short-cut mechanism we have demonstrated corresponds to the origin of
the preferential attachment. In addition, the duplication
and divergence model successfully explains the origin of
the preferential attachment in protein interaction networks [32,33]. Moreover, the emergence of the short-cut
path generates modules such as triangles and cycles whose
length is more than 3. As shown in Figure 1, modules such
as triangles and squares are merged into a network as a
result. That is, this mechanism also corresponds to the
merging module mechanism [34], which induces hierarchical modularity. In addition, these subgraphs might
reflect network motifs [35,36] such as feedforward loops
and bi-parallels because they correspond to triangles and
squares in the case of undirected graphs. Thus, this mechanism is also a possible origin of the network motifs.
In this manner, the emergence of the short-cut path can
explain the origin of several structural features: heterogeneous connectivity, network motifs (modules), and hierarchical modularity. We believe that this mechanism
exists in real metabolic networks.
The correlations between the proposed parameters and
temperature provide two hypotheses for structural difference with respect to temperature: the emergence of the
short-cut paths is inhibited at high temperature, and the
short-cut path is a bypass of a relatively long path at high
temperature.
In order to show more convincing evidence of these
hypotheses and the reliability of our model, we have also
investigated cyclic properties of metabolic networks. If
these hypotheses are correct, then we can observe the following cyclic properties in metabolic networks: the frequency of cycles is low at high temperature, and the length
of a cycle is relatively long at high temperature. As shown
in Figures 9 and 10, as expected, we have confirmed such
cyclic properties. Therefore, our hypotheses are believed
to be reliable. These cyclic properties are also novel temperature-dependent features in metabolic networks. Additionally, we can observe a variance among structural
parameters in mesophiles. A possible reason of this vari-

ance is the effect of an organism's lifestyle. Temperature
might be not the unique environmental factor in the network formation. Other factors might also influence the
structure of metabolic networks. Parter et al. have reported
that the modularity and other structural properties such as
the clustering coefficient and cyclic coefficient [30] are different between different lifestyles [37]. When we consider
one factor (temperature) only, we might see the variance
because several factors influence the formation of metabolic networks.
We speculate on possible reasons of the two formation
mechanisms, which are predicted from the model, in metabolic networks. First, we discuss why the emergence of
the short-cut path is inhibited at high temperature (the
correlation between the parameter p and temperature in
Figure 8). This might be caused by a temperature-dependent selective constraint (negative selection) [19,20].
Enzymes (reactions) might need structural stability to survive in hot environments because enzymes tend to easily
deactivate in such conditions. Metabolic networks are
believed to evolve via evolutionary events such as gene
duplication [21-23] and horizontal gene transfer [24].
Such evolutionary events consequently generate new
enzymes. In the case of gene duplication, since the one of
duplicated genes has to perform for the biological subsistence of the organism, the selective pressure against the
other gene becomes weak [25]. As a result, the other gene,
which codes for a new enzyme, tends to mutate due to
weak selective pressure. Hence, due to gene duplication,
the new enzyme might not successfully adapt to high temperature because the structural stability of the enzyme
potentially becomes low due to mutations. On the other
hand, new enzymes due to horizontal gene transfer might
have no adaptation to high temperature because such
genes, by which the new enzymes are coded, come from a
different organism. In this manner, new reactions are
hardly selected when new enzymes emerge via such evolutionary events because such enzymes might have no
adaptation to high temperature. Therefore, we expect that
the short-cut path tends to disappear because of the strong
selective constraint at high temperature.
Next, we speculate why the short-cut path bypasses a relatively long path at high temperature (the correlation
between the parameter q and temperature in Figure 8).
This might be because there are less functionally similar
enzymes at high temperatures. At high temperature, in our
model, most of the new reactions are drawn between a
new metabolite and an existing metabolite, indicating
that the new enzyme tends to be functionally dissimilar to
other enzymes. That is, the functionally dissimilar reactions (enzymes) lie in adjacent positions on a pathway.
Therefore, in some cases, distances between functionally
similar enzymes are long in a metabolic pathway. As a

result, the short-cut path might bypass a relatively long
path at high temperature when this path emerges. Of
course, this is speculation, and in order to confirm this
speculation, we need to more carefully test this hypothesis
with a combination of biological sequence analysis and
the Enzyme Commission (EC) number.
We finally summarize the origin of the structural difference in metabolic networks with respect to temperature.
From our model, the emergence of the short-cut path is
believed to determine structural properties such as the
degree exponent and the clustering coefficient of metabolic networks. Therefore, the structural properties might
change with temperature because this emergence is inhibited due to a temperature-dependent selective constraint.
We believe that the origin of structural difference with
temperature provides new insights into the evolution of
metabolic networks. Moreover, future studies in this line
of research might contribute not only to a better understanding of evolutionary history but also to advancement
of biotechnology such as detection and construction of
organisms with temperature resistance, which have a great
deal of potential in industry.

Conclusion
We have proposed a simple model, which can reproduce
the structural properties of real metabolic networks, in
order to understand a possible origin of structural difference with respect to temperature in metabolic networks.
We have found that the emergence of the short-cut path
determines the structural properties. From our model, we
have speculated that structural properties change with
temperature because the emergence of the short-cut path
tends to be inhibited due to strong selective constraint at
high temperature. In addition, we have obtained a new
hypothesis for design principles of metabolic networks:
the short-cut path bypasses a relatively long path at high
temperature if the new path emerges. We have shown
additionally convincing evidence of these hypotheses and
higher reliability of the model via network analysis.

Methods
Mathematical solution of the model
Degree distribution
First, we show an analytical solution for the degree distribution of the model via mean-field based analysis [3840]. This analysis is based on a mean-field approximation,
in which the many-body problem is considered as the
one-body problem, and is widely used in the area of statistical mechanics of complex networks. Using the meanfield analysis, we can easily get the analytical solutions.

We here consider the time evolution of ki, which is the
degree (the number of edges) of node i. The degree of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/2/82

node i increases by one with the probability 1/N, where N
is the total number of nodes, when Event I (a new metabolite and new reaction) occurs. When Event II occurs, two
existing nodes are selected, and their degrees increase
respectively as follows. One node's degree increases by
one with the probability 1/N, because this node is randomly selected. The other node's degree increases by one
with the probability ki/∑jkj, because this node is selected
by a random walk from the original randomly-selected
node. It is reported that the probability that a walker
arrives at this node equals ki/∑jkj irrespective of the
number of steps in the random walk [41]. Note that this
probability is equal to that of the probability in preferential attachment [38] which reproduces the heterogeneous
connectivity. Thus, the time evolution of ki is

⎡ 1

ki
+
k i = (1 − p) + p ⎢
dt
N
⎢ N ∑j kj
⎣

⎤
⎥,
⎥
⎦

(1)

where N = (1 - p)t because the number of nodes increases
by one with the probability 1 - p, and ∑jkj = 2t because one
edge is added at every time. Note that this equation is
independent of the bypassed path length (the parameter
q). The solution of the above equation with the initial
condition ki(t = s) = 1 is

⎛t ⎞
k i = [ A(p) + 1] ⎜ ⎟
⎝ s⎠
where A(p) = 2/[p(1 - p)].

p/2

(2)

− A(p),

From the above equation, because s/t = P (≥ k), the cumulative distribution P (≥ k) is
P(≥ k) = [A(p) + 1]2/p [k + A(p)]-2/p.

(3)

d
Since P(k) = − dk P(≥ k) , finally, we get the degree distri-

bution
P(k) = (γ - 1) [A(p) + 1]γ - 1 [k + A(p)]-γ,

(4)

where the degree exponent γ is

γ =

2
+ 1.
p

(5)

As shown in Equation (4), the degree distribution follows
a power law with a cutoff within a small degree.
Degree-dependent clustering coefficient
Next, we show an analytical solution for the degreedependent clustering coefficient of the model via meanfield analysis based on [39].

The clustering coefficient [10,12] of node i is defined as

Ci =

2 Mi
,
k i ( k i −1 )

(6)

where Mi is the number of edges among neighbors of
node i. Here we consider the time evolution of Mi. The
number of edges Mi increases with the probability p × q,
because Mi increases when Event II occurs and a path of
length 2 is bypassed (a triangle is generated). That is, we
do not need to consider a bypassed path of length greater
than 2. Then, Mi of each node, which belongs to the triangle, approximately increases by one. Mi of one node
increases by one with the probability 1/N, because this
node is selected at random. Mis of the other two nodes
increase by one with the probability ki/∑jkj, because these
nodes are selected by a random walk. Therefore, the time
evolution of Mi is

⎡ 1

(7)

where N = (1 - p)t, and ∑jkj = 2t. Moreover, ki = [A(p) + 1](t/
s)p/2 - A(p) as shown in Equation (2).

where Km is the maximum degree. The maximum degree is
the case that the cumulative probability equals 1/N ; thus
P(≥ Km) = 1/N, and from Equation (3), Km can be
expressed as
Km = Np/2[A(p + 1)] - A(p).

Equation (11) is solved via numerical integral because it
is analytically unsolvable.
Estimation of model parameters
This model has two parameters p and q. In order to reproduce structural properties in metabolic networks, we need
to estimate these parameters in real-world networks. In
this section, we show how to estimate the parameters.
The case of the parameter p
Here, we consider the average degree Όk΍ of this model.
1
The average degree is defined as 〈 k〉 = N ∑ i k i . As shown
in the previous section, N = (1 - p)t, and ∑iki = 2t. That is,

the average degree of this model is

〈 k〉 =
The solution of the above equation with the initial condition Mi(t = s) = 0 is

⎛t ⎞
Mi = 2q[ A(p) + 1] ⎜ ⎟
⎝ s⎠

p/2

+

q(p − 2) t
ln − 2q[ A(p) + 1],
1− p
s

(8)
where A(p) = 2/[p(1 - p)]. From Equation (2), since ki =
[A(p) + 1](t/s)p/2 - A(p), this equation is rewritten as

⎡
k + A( p ) ⎤
1
Mi = 2q ⎢ ( k i − 1 ) − ( 2 − p ) A ( p ) ln i
⎥.
2
1+ A ( p ) ⎥
⎢
⎣
⎦
(9)
Substituting this equation into Equation (6), we finally
get the degree-dependent clustering coefficient

⎡ 4 2( 2 − p ) A ( p ) k + A ( p ) ⎤
(10)
C(k) = q ⎢ −
ln
⎥.
k ( k −1 )

⎢k
⎣
⎦
Average clustering coefficient
Finally, we show a mathematical solution for the average
clustering coefficient of the model. Since the average clustering coefficient is expressed as the summation of the
product of the degree distribution and the degree-dependent clustering coefficient, it can be described as

From this equation, therefore, the parameter p is estimated by

where Όk΍ is obtained from real metabolic networks.
The case of the parameter q
Here, we consider the number of triangles T of this model.

In this model, the number of triangles approximately
increases by one with the probability p × q because a triangle is generated with the probability q when Event II
occurs. That is,
T Ӎ pqt.

Since N = (1 - p)t, this equation is rewritten as

where Όʜ΍ denotes the average over all nodes. The values,
Όk΍, Όk2΍, and N, are obtained from real metabolic networks.

Data set
We used the metabolic networks of 113 organisms, which
were previously investigated in Reference [18]. These metabolic networks are represented by undirected graphs in
which nodes and edges correspond to metabolites and
substrate-product relationships, respectively. For example, we consider a reaction S1+S2 → P1+P2. In this case,
metabolites S1 and S2 connect to products P1 and P2,
respectively. That is, the edge list is as follows: (S1, P1),
(S1, P2), (S2, P1), (S2, P2). Note that if there are stoichiometric coefficients in the metabolic data used, then they
are neglected. In order to accentuate constitutive pathways, these networks exclude 13 ubiquitous metabolites
that serve for energy exchange, exchange of a proton or a
phosphate moiety, and so on. To be exact, the following
metabolites are excluded: water, ATP, ADP, NAD, NADH,
NADPH, carbon dioxide, ammonia, sulfate, thioredoxin,
(ortho) phosphate (P), pyrophosphate (PP), and H+. We
only focused on the largest components of the metabolic
networks in order to more accurately evaluate the structural properties.

Indices for cyclic property
In order to characterize cyclic properties of networks, we
define two indices inspired by the cyclic coefficient [30].

Maximum likelihood method considering a cutoff
In order to obtain the degree exponent from real metabolic networks, we used the maximum likelihood method
[27]. However, this original method does not consider a
cutoff, which we denote by the constant A(p), in the
degree distribution. Thus, it is difficult to compare of the
degree exponent between the model and the real data.
Consequently, we consider an extended maximum likelihood method:

⎡
γ =1+ N ⎢
⎢
⎣

N

∑
i =1

k + A( p ) ⎤
⎥
ln i
k min + A ( p ) ⎥
⎦

−1

One is the cycle index of node i, defied as

ric =

2
k i ( k i −1 )

∑R

i
jh ,

(20)

〈 jh〉

where
⎧ 1 (If there is at least one cycle
⎪
R ijh = ⎨
that passes through node i and its two neighbors j and h)
o
⎪ 0 (Otherwise),
⎩

(21)
and Όjh΍ denotes all pairs of neighbors of node i. In addition, ki is the degree of node i. We can understand that this
index is an extended clustering coefficient. This index considers cycles whose length is at least 3; however, the original clustering coefficient only focuses on cycles of length
3.
The second index is the cycle length index of node i,
defined as

ril =

i
−1
∑〈 jh〉 (L jh − 2)
i
∑〈 jh〉 R jh

(22)

,

where Lijh is the length of the smallest cycle that passes
through node i and its two neighbors j and h.

,

(18)

where kmin is the minimum degree in a network.

In order to characterize global cyclic properties, in this sec1
tion, we focus on the average indices 〈 r c 〉 = N

∑i =1 ric
N

1
and 〈 r l 〉 = N ∑ i =1 ril , where N is the total number of
nodes. Small values of Όrc΍ indicate a low frequency of
cycles in networks. Moreover, small Όrl΍ means that the
cycle length is globally long in networks.
N

Null model
We used a null model to validate our model. The null
model is an uncorrelated random scale-free network
[28,29], and is a popular model. Assuming a power-law
degree distribution, in the null model, we can obtain a
null hypothesis for the degree-dependent clustering coefficient C(k) and the average clustering coefficient C using

Ignoring cycles generated by the network representation
Using these indices as cyclic properties, we investigated
the resulting cyclic properties in the metabolic networks
of 113 organisms in order to test the hypotheses for cycles,
which are generated due to the emergence of the short-cut

path. However, we cannot directly use the metabolic networks, which are analyzed in Reference [18] because the
metabolic networks include cycles, which are drawn by
the network representation. For example, we consider a
reaction S1+S2→P1+P2. In this case, a cycle of length 4, is
generated as shown in Figure 11.

Acknowledgements
In this manner, cycles due to the network representation
would be drawn when the types of all metabolites are different in a reaction and, as a result, the right-hand side and
the left-hand side concurrently consist of multiple metabolites. Therefore, we ignored such cycles when calculated
the cycle indices.
Statistical analysis
In order to assess the significance of the observed correlations, we used Pearson's correlation coefficient r, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient rs, and their P -value P.
We determine that there is a significant correlation
between a structural property and optimal growth temperature when P < 0.05.
