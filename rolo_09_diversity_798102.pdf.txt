Abstract
Background: PspA is recognized as a major pneumococcal virulence factor and a possible vaccine
candidate. The aim of this study was to analyze the PspA family and clade distribution among 112
Spanish pneumococci representatives of dominant clones among patients with invasive disease (n
= 66) and nasopharyngeal healthy carriage in children (n = 46).
Results: PspA family 2 was predominant among invasive (63.6%) and carriage (54.3%)
pneumococcal isolates. No PspA family 3 isolates were detected and only one strain was PspA
negative. Although four clonal complexes contained strains of different clades, a clear association
between clade and multi locus sequence typing results was found. Clades 1, 3 and 4 were associated
with a wide variety of sequence types (ST) related to multiresistant and antibiotic-susceptible
worldwide-disseminated clones. Clade 1 was associated with Spain6B-ST90, Spain14-ST18,
Colombia5-ST289, Sweden1-ST306, Denmark14-ST230 and Sweden1-ST304 clones. Clade 3 was
associated with Spain23F-ST81, Spain9V-ST156, Tennessee14-ST67, Netherlands3-ST180 and
Netherlands7F-ST191 clones. Clade 4 was related to Sweden15A-ST63, Netherlands18C-ST113 and
Greece21-ST193 clones. In contrast, PspA clade was not related to serotype, age or clinical origin
of the isolates.
Conclusion: PspA clades were associated with genotypes. PspA family 2 and family 1 were
dominant among major Spanish pneumococcal clones isolated from patients with invasive disease
and nasopharyngeal carriage in children.

Background
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of serious community-acquired diseases (such as pneumonia, bacteremia or meningitis), especially in children, the elderly, and
among patients with immunological disorders [1].
Nasopharyngeal colonization by S. pneumoniae is highly

common, particularly among children attending day-care
centers and in adults in long-term institutions [2].
Pneumococci are presently divided into 91 serotypes,
which are defined by differences in their polysaccharide
capsule [3,4]. Two serotype-based vaccines are currently

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:80

available: the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (23V-PSV)
which has been shown to be effective in the elderly [5-7],
and the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
(PCV7) which is used in children below the age of two [5].
In the USA the introduction of PCV7 in children was associated with a decrease in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) among children and adults [8].
Moreover, a decrease in IPD caused by resistant strains has
also been observed [9]. Although current IPD rates are
lower than those observed in the pre-vaccine period,
recent reports have shown an increase in IPD caused by
non-vaccine serotypes in the USA [10]. In Spain, since the
introduction of PCV7, IPD rates due to PCV7 serotypes
have decreased in both children and adults, but this
improvement has been counterbalanced by an increase in
IPD due to non-PCV7 serotypes [11,12].
Currently, two new conjugated vaccines are under development – 10-valent and the 13-valent vaccines, which
both contain some emerging serotypes [13]. Alternative
vaccines are also being evaluated, such as those based on
pneumococcal virulence proteins. Many pneumococcal
proteins have been investigated as vaccine candidates, for
instance, pneumolysin, PsaA, PspC, and PspA [13,14].
The pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) is an important virulence factor which interferes with complement
deposition on the pneumococcal surface [15] and is
detected in almost all pneumococci [16-18]. It is highly
immunogenic and protective and has proved to be highly
cross-reactive both in various animal models [15,19,20]
and in humans [21]. It is hypothesized that a PspA-based
vaccine could protect against invasive disease and also
eliminate the carrier state [15-22]. PspA is constituted by
five domains: a signal peptide, a α-helical charged
domain which includes a clade-defining region, a prolinerich region, a choline-binding domain and a C-terminal
domain [16]. Although the PspA encoding gene (pspA) is
highly genetically variable, the classification by families is
based on nucleotide and amino acid identity. Each of the
three PspA families is subdivided into different clades:
family 1 is composed by two clades (clade 1 and 2), family
2 comprises three clades (clades 3, 4 and 5), and PspA
family 3 has only one divergent clade (clade 6) [16].
The aim of this study was to analyze the distribution of the
PspA clades among a pneumococcal collection representative of major clones found in two previous studies
among healthy children carriers [23] and patients with
invasive disease [11].

Methods
Bacterial strains
One hundred and twelve pneumococcal strains previously characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE) with SmaI restriction enzyme, as described else-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/80

where [24] and serotyped by Quellung reaction [25], were
selected as follows:
a) Forty-nine pneumococci isolated from adults with IPD
in Barcelona (NorthEast of Spain) between 1997 and
2007 (Additional file 1). These 49 strains were representative of the 32 major genotypes found among 968 pneumococci causing IPD in adult patients in Barcelona [11].
The pneumococcal strains selected were isolated from
blood (n = 36), CSF (n = 11) and other sterile fluids (n =
2);
b) Seventeen pneumococci isolated from patients with
IPD in Oviedo (Northern Spain) in 2004–2005 (Additional file 1) selected as representative of the nine major
PFGE patterns among 101 consecutive invasive strains
(unpublished data). The selected strains were isolated
from blood (n = 11), CSF (n = 3) and other sterile fluids
(n = 3);
c) Forty-six pneumococci were selected from nasopharyngeal carriers aged from 1 to 4 years old, in Oviedo (Northern Spain) in 2004–2005 [23] (Additional file 1). These
strains were representative of 29 dominant PFGE patterns
found among 365 pneumococci isolated from children
attending 23 day-care centers.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by microdilution following CLSI guidelines [26]
using a panel of antimicrobials which included penicillin,
erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and cotrimoxazol. Resistant strains were defined
according to CLSI criteria [27]. S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619
was used as control.
Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and eBURST
MLST was performed as described previously [28]. The
allele's number and sequence types (ST) were assigned
using the pneumococcal MLST website [29]. Lineage
assignment was achieved by eBURST analysis [30,31].
PspA detection
The PCRs were carried out in a standard PCR mixture of
50 μl containing 2.5 mM of MgCl2, 240 μM (each) of
deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), 0.3 μM of each
primer, and 2 U of Taq DNA polymerase (AmpliTaq
Gold®, Roche). The cycle conditions consisted of: an initial 94°C (10 min), 30 cycles of 94°C (1 min), 55°C (1
min) and 72°C (3 min), followed by 72°C (10 min). A
multiplex PCR reaction was tested [32], but some samples
did not amplify with LSM12/SKH63 [32,33] or LSM12/
SKH52 [22] primer combinations. The combination of
LSM12/SKH2 primers [16] was successfully used for all
samples except one. The isolate that did not amplify was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/80

retested with the same cycle pattern at an annealing temperature of 52°C and with different primer combinations
(LSM12/SKH63, LSM12/SKH52 and LSM12/SKH2). Controls for PspA family 1 (Spain14-ST18) and PspA family 2
(Spain23F-ST81) were run in each reaction set. PCR products were purified and sequenced using SKH2 primer, as
described elsewhere [34]. Sequence edition was performed using the SeqScape version 2.1.1 (Applied Biosystems) software, while DNA sequences were assigned using
BLAST [35]. Clade type was established when the closest
match presented identity higher than 95% (Figure 1). The
phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were
conducted using MEGA4 version 4.1 software [36]. The
evolutionary history was inferred using the NeighborJoining method and the bootstrap consensus tree inferred
from 1000 replicates. The evolutionary distances were
computed using the Kimura 2-parameter method [36].
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers
The sequences of 27 isolates representing all the different
sequences from this collection were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers: [GenBank:FJ665158, GenBank:FJ665159, GenBank:FJ665160, GenBank:FJ665161,

PspA families and clade distribution
Among the 112 pneumococci studied, the majority
(59.8%, 67/112) were identified as belonging to PspA
family 2 (31 isolates of clade 3, 27 of clade 4 and nine of
clade 5), while the remaining 39.3% (44/112) belonged
to family 1 (29 isolates of clade 1 and 15 of clade 2). One
strain was negative. No PspA family 3 isolates were
detected. Figure 1 shows the phylogenetic tree of the 27
new PspA sequences found as well as the accession numbers and the percentage of identity to previously published sequences. Sequences of strains of PspA families 1
and 2 were precisely grouped, and all were joined into
their respective clades. The similarity of isolates of the
same family ranged from 84% to 100%. The percentage of
similarity within isolates of the same clade ranged as follows: clade 1 (84 to 95), clade 2 (84 to 100), clade 3 (93
to 99), clade 4 (91 to 98) and clade 5 (96 to 100).

Among the 66 pneumococci isolated from patients with
IPD, 63,6% (42/66) were found to be of PspA family 2
(24 isolates of clade 3, 12 of clade 4 and six of clade 5),
34.8% (23/66) of family 1 (20 isolates of clade 1 and
three of clade 2) and one isolate was negative. The high
prevalence of PspA family 2 among pneumococci isolated
from adults with IPD has already been reported in Spain,
Canada, Sweden, the USA and France [37,38], although in
Australia, the UK and Japan PspA family 1 was the most
prevalent [38,39]. The dominance of family 2, clade 3
observed in our study has also been reported in other
studies of pneumococci causing IPD in adults in France
[37] and in children from Germany [40].

evolutionary analyses were conducted with the MEGA4 program (version 4.1) [36] by the Neighbor-Joining method.
Only bootstrap confidence intervals exceeding 90% are
shown.

PspA family 2 was also dominant (54.3%, 25/46) among
pneumococci isolated from the nasopharynx of healthy
children (seven of clade 3, 15 of clade 4 and three of clade
5), while family 1 accounted for 45.7% (21/46) of the
strains (nine of clade 1 and 12 of clade 2). These data are
in agreement with two PspA studies [32,34] which found
PspA family 2 to be dominant among pneumococci isolated from Brazilian children carriers. Moreover, the clade
distribution also showed a prevalence of clade 4, followed
by clade 1 and clade 3 [34]. A recent publication with data
collected from pneumococci isolated from nasopharyngeal carriage in Finnish children showed similar prevalences of PspA family 1 and family 2 [41].

and source. The pneumococci isolated from children carriers or from patients with IPD invasive disease seem to be
indistinct, suggesting that PspA type is independent of age
or clinical origin, as has been shown elsewhere [32,34].
Relationship between PspA and serotypes
In agreement with previous studies [16,32,42] our results
showed that PspA clades are independent of serotypes.
Pneumococci of the same serotype were associated with
different PspA clades from the same or a different family
(Additional file 1). For instance, pneumococci of serotype
6A could have PspA clade 2 (family 1), whereas pneumococci of serotype 6B could express PspA clades 1, 2, 4 or 5
(families 1 and 2). Since PspA is independent of serotype,
PspA-based vaccines could improve upon the results
obtained with serotype-based vaccines and might avoid a
possible serotype replacement, as previously observed
[10]. Since a PspA-based vaccine potentially has high coverage due to the fact that it is cross protective and immunogenic among children and adults [21], similar data
should be investigated in other geographical areas in
order to study the potential coverage of a PspA-based vaccine, and to adapt it to different formulations if necessary.
Relationship between PspA and clones
PspA clade classification was related to genotypes, and all
strains with the same ST always presented the same PspA
clade (see Additional file 1), regardless of origin or capsular type. In spite of the high genetical variability of pspA
gene, all isolates of the same ST showed 100% of identity
between their sequences. For instance, among nine pneumococci with ST63 obtained from invasive and carriage
samples, four capsular types were found (15A, 19A, 19F
and 23F) but all of them had PspA of clade 4 (see Additional file 1). However, other authors have found different
PspA families among isolates that shared a common ST
[41]. In our study, among 65 STs found, only 7 accounted
for more than three isolates (ST63 n = 9, ST156 n = 5, and
ST42, ST260, ST180, ST62 and ST81 with four isolates
each). This fact may be a limitation of the present study
and may affect its capacity to assess the relationship
between ST and PspA.

The eBURST analysis reveals the presence of 15 clonal
complexes (CC) and 22 singletons (S) (Additional file 1).
The association of CC and S with clade was as follows:
clade 1 (23 STs: 7 CC and 7 S), clade 2 (11 STs: 4 CC and
2 S), clade 3 (14 STs: 3 CC and 6 S), clade 4 (13 STs: 4 CC
and 4 S), and clade 5 (4 STs: 1 CC and 3 S). Four CCs contained only clade 1-associated STs, three CCs contained
clade 4-related STs, two CCs contained only clade 2related STs, and two CC contained clade 3-related STs.
Four CCs contained STs related to two different clades of
the same or a different PspA family.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/80

The relationship of PspA clade with multiresistant worldwide-disseminated clones described by the Pneumococcal
Molecular Epidemiology Network (PMEN) [24] has been
reported previously [32,42-44]. Our study provides further information since the majority of CCs found are
related to PMEN clones. For instance, the Spain9V-ST156
(CC156) clone, which is one of the most important clones
causing IPD worldwide [11,32,42,43], included six STs in
the present study. All six STs of this CC had PspA clade 3,
suggesting that PspA is highly conserved in this clone,
even in SLV or DLV or when expressing capsular type 9 V
or 14. Similar results were found among other CCs related
to other multiresistant PMEN clones: Spain6B-ST90 (clade
1), Spain14-ST18 (clade 1), Denmark14-ST230 (clade 1),
Spain23F-ST81 (clade 3), Greece21-ST193 (clade 4) and
Sweden15A-ST63 (clade 4). The CC439 related to PMEN
clone Tennessee23F-ST37, which included six STs in our
study, had two PspA clades (1 and 4). This finding was in
agreement with a study from Finland, which found PspA
from families 1 and 2 among isolates within the same or
different ST of this CC439 [41].
There is still little information about the relationship
between PspA clade and antibiotic-susceptible PMEN
clones, since the available data only refer to family level
[42]. Our study provides new information about the antibiotic-susceptible clones, which are associated with the
increase of IPD observed in recent years in some European
countries [11,45] and in the USA [10]. For instance, the
Sweden1-ST306 clone had clade 1. This clone has been
described as the cause of IPD outbreaks in Europe and its
frequency is currently increasing in Spain as cause of IPD
and, especially, parapneumonic empyema in children
[45]. CCs which were also related to antibiotic-susceptible
PMEN clones included clade 1 (Colombia5-ST289 and
Sweden1-ST304) and clade 3 (Netherlands7F-ST191,
Netherlands3-ST180 and Tennessee14-ST67). Other associations of PspA clade with emerging clones were also
observed such as clade 1 for serotype 22-ST433 and serotype 10A-CC97, and clade 5 for serotype 12-ST989. The
CC53 (Netherlands8-ST53) included strains of two clades:
clade 1 for those isolated with ST53 that were serotype 8,
and clade 3 for isolates with ST62 (DLV) that were serotype 11A or non-typeable.
Since PspA type is associated with genotype, and with our
knowledge of the clonal distribution of pneumococci
causing IPD in Southern Barcelona area [11] we estimate
that at least 45.1% would be of PspA family 2, and 23.4%
of family 1. The most prevalent clades among invasive
pneumococci would be clade 3 (48.2%) and clade 1
(33.7%). Similarly, we estimate that among the pneumococci isolated from children carriage [23] at least 31.6%
appear to be PspA family 2 and 29.8% PspA family 1, with

clade 3 (26.0%) and clade 1 (22.5%) being the most frequent.

Conclusion
Our study supports previous data [34,38,39,43] demonstrating that PspA family and clade distribution are independent of serotype, age and clinical origin of the isolates,
but are highly associated with genotype. This study suggests that PspA family 1 and 2 molecules should be
included in future PspA-based vaccine formulations. Further studies are needed to determine the genetic diversity
of PspA in each geographical area.
