Abstract
Background: Prolactin receptor (PRLR) and growth hormone receptor (GHR) belong to the
large superfamily of class 1 cytokine receptors. Both of them have been identified as candidate
genes affecting key quantitative traits, like growth and reproduction in livestock. We have
previously studied the molecular anatomy of the cytoplasmic domain of GHR in different cattle
breeds and artiodactyl species. In this study we have analysed the corresponding cytoplasmic
signalling region of PRLR.
Results: We sequenced PRLR gene exon 10, coding for the major part of the cytoplasmic domain,
from cattle, American bison, European bison, yak, sheep, pig and wild boar individuals. We found
different patterns of variation in the two receptors within and between ruminants and pigs. Pigs and
bison species have no variation within GHR exon 10, but show high haplotype diversity for the
PRLR exon 10. In cattle, PRLR shows lower diversity than GHR. The Bovinae PRLR haplotype
network fits better the known phylogenetic relationships between the species than that of the
GHR, where differences within cattle breeds are larger than between the different species in the
subfamily. By comparison with the wild boar haplotypes, a high number of subsequent
nonsynonymous substitutions seem to have accumulated in the pig PRLR exon 10 after
domestication.
Conclusion: Both genes affect a multitude of traits that have been targets of selection after
domestication. The genes seem to have responded differently to different selection pressures
imposed by human artificial selection. The results suggest possible effects of selective sweeps in
GHR before domestication in the pig lineage or species divergence in the Bison lineage. The PRLR
results may be explained by strong directional selection in pigs or functional switching.

Background
Domestication or the unique form of mutualism that
develops between a human population and a target ani-

mal population has strong selective advantages for both
partners [1]. Livestock domestication started around
10000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, beginning with

goats and sheep [2]. Important traits regarding domestication include behaviour and reproduction as well as dairying [3]. Milking of the ruminant animals was practiced
intensively already over 8000 years ago (sixth and seventh
millennia BC) in northwest Anatolia. Domesticated livestock species have undergone and are constantly under
artificial selection. Strong directional selection in domestic animals is postulated to have led to selective sweeps in
which alleles at loci that underlie selected traits (growth,
fertility, milk production, coat colour) have decreased or
increased markedly in their frequency [4]. A recent
genome wide analysis of cattle identified detectable signatures of domestication and artificial selection in the cattle
genome, but also that the current levels of diversity within
breeds are at least as great as within humans [5]. However,
the effects of domestication and artificial selection are still
mostly unknown at the level of nucleotide sequence variation.
Accumulating knowledge of the domestic species
genomes has enabled mapping of loci affecting key traits
under artificial selection in livestock. In cattle, numerous
such quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been identified.
Over fifty QTLs have been localized to cattle chromosome
20 http://genomes.sapac.edu.au/bovineqtl/. Two interesting candidate genes with potential effects on various agronomically important traits, prolactin receptor (PRLR) and
growth hormone receptor (GHR) locate in this chromosome at a distance of 7.5 Mb (Btau4.0, Oct.2007, http://
www.ensembl.org). An S to N substitution (S18N) in the
signal peptide of the PRLR is linked with protein and fat
yield [6] and the substitution F279N in the transmembrane part of the GHR has been suggested to be a quantitative trait nucleotide/causative mutation affecting milk
fat and protein percentage [7].
Both GHR and PRLR belong to the superfamily of class I
cytokine receptors, which presumably arose as the result
of multiple gene duplications and subsequent divergent
evolution. GHR and PRLR share a common tertiary structure (an extracellular domain, a single membrane spanning transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic
domain). They mediate the signals of their ligands, the
growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL) and placental lactogen (PL). The binding of the ligand to the extracellular
part induces homo- or heterodimerization of the receptors, followed by intracellular signal transmission by the
JAK-Stat signalling pathway [8,9]. Both GHR and PRLR are
involved in mammary growth and function. The main
biological role of the GH is the control of postnatal
growth, whereas the additional reported effects of PRL
include involvement in seasonality, reproduction, behaviour and immunoregulation. Amino acid sequence identity between GHR and PRLR varies between 30% and 70%
depending on the part of the receptor. The greatest simi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/172

larity of the aa sequences between GHR and PRLR is in the
extracellular domains. The cytoplasmic domain and especially the well conserved BOX1 is essential for signal transduction.
We have previously examined the GHR cytoplasmic
domain sequence in different cattle breeds and Artiodactyla species [10], where we observed interesting polymorphism. The aim of this study was to characterize patterns
of polymorphism in the corresponding intracellular
region of PRLR in different Artiodactyla species and
breeds to enable the comparison of sequence evolution in
response to domestication and artificial selection in two
evolutionary related and closely located candidate genes.

Results
The sequence analysis of the cytoplasmic domain of the
PRLR gene revealed interesting variation in wild and
domesticated Artiodactyla species and subspecies (Table
1). Altogether 13 SNPs were found from the cattle samples. Of these six were present in both European and African cattle: one nsSNP (E378K) and five sSNPs (Nt1088,
Nt1427, Nt1622, Nt1754, and Nt1775). European cattle
had two private nsSNPs (P340T, A536V) and two private
sSNPs (Nt1682, Nt1817) while African cattle had two private nsSNPs (V439M and L497R) and one private sSNP
(Nt1769). The cattle SNPs were inferred to segregate as 14
haplotypes (Figure 1) two of which were shared by European and African cattle (haplotypes BOS_PRLR1 and
BOS_PRLR2). American bison and European bison
shared one nsSNP (E384K). Besides that, American bison
had one private nsSNP (D588E). European bison samples
were more divergent; they had two private nsSNPs
(Q397K and M446V) and one sSNP (Nt1730). Statistically inferred haplotypes for the American bison and
European bison are given in Figure 1. American bison and
European bison share one haplotype, BBI_PRLR3/
BBO_PRLR3. The studied yak samples were monomorphic (Figure 1). Sheep samples carried four sSNP
(Nt1007, Nt1160, Nt1217, and Nt1400) and three nsSNP
(E387K, A476T, and S480R) in exon 10. The E387K position has been fixed to E in the Bos lineage and K in the
Bison lineage.
Statistical haplotype reconstruction uncovered 4 different
sheep haplotypes. Cloning of one ambiguous sheep individual revealed two unique haplotypes (OVIS_PRLR5 and
OVIS_PRLR6) and these haplotypes were included in further analysis (Figure 2). Numbering of the Bos and Bison,
and Ovis SNPs is based on the reference sequence
NM_001039726. All Bos, Bison and Ovis SNPs were in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
From the domestic pig samples we found one sSNP
(Nt1620) and eight nsSNPs (L406P, D428A, A461G,

K480R, M510L, G534S, G597S, and A601V). Numbering
of the pig SNPs is based on the pig cDNA sequence
DQ157757, according to the numbering of previously
identified SNPs [11]. All SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium. The SNPs in pig exon 10 constitute 5 different haplotypes (Figure 3). Seven out of nine wild boar
individuals were SUS_PRLR4 homozygotes, one individual was SUS_PRLR5 homozygote and one individual had
haplotype SUS_PRLR4 and haplotype SUS_PRLR4-del.
SUS_PRLR4-del haplotype has a three-nucleotide deletion
(Nt1439 â Nt1441) inducing lack of aa 480. PRLR haplotype sequences from the different species have been
deposited in GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov with
the accession numbers FJ901275 â FJ901301 and
FJ901303 â FJ901307.
Comparison of variation in the GHR and PRLR cytoplasmic domains in the species analysed in both studies is presented in Table 1. New results from the wild boar and
European bison GHR sequencing have been added. All
wild boars were monomorphic having the same haplotype in GHR exon 10 as domestic pigs (FJ901302) and
European bison was shown to have the same GHR exon
10 haplotype [GenBank:DQ062723] as American bison.
The most dramatic difference in the variation between
GHR and PRLR within species is seen in the domestic pig.
The complete lack of variation in GHR is contrasted with
the high haplotype and nucleotide diversity in the PRLR,
consisting of mainly nonsynonymous variation.
In the Bovinae subfamily PRLR and GHR show different
features in the two Bison species from cattle. The Bison spe-

cies, like pigs, are monomorphic for GHR; but show high
level of haplotype diversity in PRLR. The African cattle
shows equally high levels of diversity at both genes,
whereas in European cattle the haplotype and nucleotide
diversity is lower at PRLR. The yak is monomorphic for
both genes. Sheep belongs to the same family, Bovidae, as
Bovinae species. Sheep has similar number of nsSNPs in
GHR as in PRLR; however PRLR in all is more polymorphic.
The different indices of neutrality at PRLR, Tajima's D
value, Fu and Li's D* and F* values are mainly reflecting
the same pattern with each other. The D values for African
cattle, European bison and domestic pig are positive and
for European cattle and sheep negative (Table 1). Only the
values for African cattle (both at PRLR and GHR) deviate
statistically significantly from zero. Artificially selected
populations, like livestock species, do not fulfil the
assumptions of random mating and constant population
size for the neutrality test, hence positive Tajima's D values are likely due to the demographic histories of these
species or breeds rather than true balancing selection.
Considering the known history of zebu-taurine crossbreeding in Africa [12], the observed allelic diversity is
most likely caused by admixture
A sliding window plot of the nucleotide divergence along
PRLR exon 10 in 18 vertebrate species is presented in Figure 4. Two regions of low nucleotide diversity are evident,
one at the beginning and one in the region between 270
bp and 400 bp from the beginning of the exon 10. All E to

Statistically inferred cattle, yak, American bison and European bison haplotypes from the PRLR exon 10. Only

can/European bison E384K, and sheep E387K) are within
27 bp in the second low diversity module and additionally one European bison K to Q substitution and two pig
substitutions (L406P and D428A) fall inside this region.
We studied the possible impacts of the aa changes for the
protein structure with the methods implemented in SIFT
and PolyPhen programs [13,14]. The substitution E378K
found in cattle was predicted to affect protein function by
SIFT analysis (score 0.02). Two other SNPs, E384K in both
bison species and V439M in cattle, got SIFT scores below
0.1 (Table 2). This cut-off value has been suggested to provide better sensitivity for detecting deleterious SNPs [13].
E (glutamic acid) is a polar, acidic amino acid; K (lysine)
is a polar and basic amino acid; V (valine) and M (methionine) are nonpolar and neutral amino acids.
Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis revealed that in
European cattle only one pairwise SNP comparison
showed LD (r2 = 1). On the other hand, in African cattle
seven pairwise SNP comparisons were in LD (r2 = 1). The
same LD pattern was visible in GHR exon 10 [10]. In

sheep one pairwise SNP comparison was in LD (r2 = 1), in
pigs two pairwise SNP comparisons showed LD (r2 = 1).
A parsimony haplotype network for the subfamily Bovinae is presented in Figure 5a. Most of the common cattle
haplotypes differ from the major haplotype BOS_PRLR1
only by one nucleotide. However, there are several
deduced intermediate haplotypes that were not seen in
this study (and some of the substitutions are present in
two different locations on the network). The most common haplotype for the African cattle is BOS_PRLR4. It is
absent in European cattle and differs by two nonsynonymous and five synonymous substitutions from the
BOS_PRLR1 (the most common haplotype for the European cattle). Thus the BOS_PRLR4 as well as BOS_PRLR9,
BOS_PRLR10, BOS_PRLR11 and BOS_PRLR12 probably
represent zebu haplotypes in our data, reflecting the deep
divergence between the taurine and zebu genomes [12].
According to the PRLR network, the yaks are more closely
related to the genus Bison than to the genus Bos. The most
frequent cattle haplotype BOS_PRLR1 and the yak haplo-

type BOSgr_PRLR1 differ by three nonsynonymous and
by seven synonymous substitutions, whereas the yak haplotype differs from the American bison haplotype
BBI_PRLR1 by three nonsynonymous substitutions. The
haplotype BBI_PRLR1 differs by five nonsynonymous and
by six synonymous substitutions from the BOS_PRLR1.
Sheep haplotypes differ from each other with one or two
substitutions, OVIS_PRLR1 being the major sheep haplotype (Figure 5b). Figure 5c presents the parsimony network from the Sus data. Substitution G534S is the only
polymorphism that occurs twice in the network. The
major wild boar haplotype SUS_PRLR4 is separated from
the two most diverged domestic pig haplotypes
SUS_PRLR2 and SUS_PRLR3 by five nonsynonymous
substitutions.

Discussion
In this study we demonstrate different patterns of variation in PRLR and GHR in ruminants and pigs, suggesting
divergent evolution and selection pressures before and
after domestication.
The PRLR molecular anatomy shows interesting differences from the GHR. The Bovinae PRLR haplotype network is very different from that of the GHR [10], where
differences within European breeds, within African breeds
and between European/African breeds were larger than
between different species (cattle, yak, American bison as
well European bison (data from European bison obtained
from this study)). The PRLR network fits better to the
known phylogenetic relationships between species.
Within cattle breeds, European cattle are lacking major
private PRLR haplotypes in contrast to the previous GHR
study. Instead the two major haplotypes, BOS_PRLR1 and
BOS_PRLR2 are shared between European and African
cattle.
During pig domestication in Europe (started about 6000
years ago), domesticated progeny of the local European
wild boars replaced introduced near eastern domestic pigs
[15]. According to the coalescent theory the most frequent
haplotype in a population level study is the ancestral haplotype [16], on the other hand Watterson et al [17] argued
that the higher the mutation rate, the less likely it is that
the most frequent allele would be the oldest. Considering
the population history of the pigs, we assume that the
major wild boar haplotype SUS_PRLR4, even though not
the most frequent haplotype is a good candidate for being
the ancestral haplotype of the European domestic pig. If
true, substitutions leading to rest of the domestic pig
Sus_PRLR haplotypes have happened after the domestication, as the haplotypes are derived by a series of consecutive substitutions. The result is similar with the result
obtained from the MC1R gene that has an effect on coat
colour in pigs [18]. MC1R alleles/haplotypes differ by

more than one nonsynonymous mutation from the wildtype, implying a long history of strong positive selection
for coat colour variants. It is argued that coat colour phenotypes result from direct human selection [18]. Three
domestic pig haplotypes differ from the SUS_PRLR4 by
two or more nonsynonymous substitutions, the largest
difference being five nonsynonymous substitutions. The
rapid accumulation of mutations in the PRLR gene in the
pig is best explained by human influence. Domestication
and following selection for agricultural purposes have
reduced breed effective population sizes to relatively
small numbers. In a population with low Ne a larger fraction of slightly deleterious mutations can reach fixation
due to less efficient purifying selection [19]. This may provide one explanation for the observed polymorphism in
PRLR. However, the GHR gene is monomorphic in the
same pig sample, suggesting different selection pressures
(selective sweep or strong purifying selection in GHR,
strong positive selection for PRLR).
After domestication the reproduction performance of the
pig has increased several folds due to an increase in litters
per year and piglets per litter [20]. This has been made
possible by selection and making the environment more
favourable for the sow to allocate resources to more off-

spring. Many studies in pigs have revealed significant
association of PRLR polymorphisms with different reproduction traits (e.g. [11,21,22]). Mouse knockout models
of the PRLR have confirmed the importance of the PRL in
reproduction (reviewed by [23]). In addition to reproductive performance, the list of modes of actions of PRLR is
long [8] and shows considerable change through vertebrate evolution [9].
If a gene has undergone repeated alternating functional
adaptation to fulfil one or two, even more, functions, it
can lead to accumulation of many amino acid substitutions with slightly little overall change of function. This
phenomenon has been called functional switching [24]
and could thus explain PRLR polymorphism. Based on
the studies done with the domestic animals (e.g.
[6,7,11,21,22,25]), PRLR could fulfil the criterion of functional switching. However, the accumulation of mutations in the domestic pig PRLR seems too fast to be
explained by functional switching alone.
The major role of GHR involves postnatal growth and
mammary function. The lack of variation in the GHR signalling domain in pigs and undomesticated ruminants is
intriguing. The lack of variation in pigs could be the result

of a strong selective sweep that has happened before
domestication and has been maintained in domestic pigs.
On the other hand, the low diversity in the wild boar may
reflect a narrow genetic background of the Finnish wild
boar population. The possible target (causative mutation)
of selection at or close to the GHR exon 10 is not known.
In contrast, the GHR gene cytoplasmic domain in current
cattle breeds harbours lots of interesting persistent polymorphism, indicating its possible importance for cattle
being malleable for artificial selection for growth and lactation traits [10].

Domestication is a cumulative process marked by changes
on both sides of the mutualistic relationship. Long-living
animals like cattle respond slower to selection than for
example annual crops [1]. Traits that have been the target
of domestication and subsequent selection and the genes
that affect them, i.e. so called domestication genes, are of
special interest even though the success to identify these
genes from livestock has been low [1,4]. Genes identified
by QTL studies are good candidates for genes important
for domestication success [1].

Conclusion
The PRLR gene on the other hand shows contrasting evolution in the studied species, having more substitution
polymorphism in pig breeds and bison species than in
cattle. Functional analysis indicated possible effects for
nsSNPs found in cattle and bison, but didn't reveal any
effect on the protein structure for pig nsSNPs. However,
methods defining effects of SNPs are only predictions,
and the combined effects of various nsSNPs can not be
analysed by current statistical methods. No known 3D
structure for PRLR is available, so more detailed analysis
whether the substitution sites are in spatial contact with
critical residues remains unknown. Functional analysis at
the molecular level would be necessary to solve the relevance of the polymorphisms.

QTL candidate genes GHR and PRLR have varying roles in
growth, lactation and reproduction in domestic species
and may have responded differently in different species
and breeds within species to different selection pressures.
We show here that these genes have different evolutionary
history among artiodactyls. Most likely both genes have
been heavily influenced by artificial selection during and
after domestication. We found an unanticipated amount
of nonsynonymous variation accumulated or persisted in
these genes in artiodactyl species during the short period
of domestication (8000 â 10 000 years) and subsequent
artificial selection. The differences between species indicate possible effects of selective sweeps before domestication (GHR in pigs) or before species divergence (GHR in
Bison), directional (artificial) selection (PRLR in pigs) or
functional switching (GHR in cattle, PRLR).

Methods
Materials
We investigated 216 individuals from 12 different European Bos taurus breeds (commercial dairy breeds: Finnish
Ayrshire, Finnish Holstein-Friesian; native Finnish dairy
breeds: Western Finncattle, Northern Finncattle, Eastern
Finncattle, Russian breeds: Kholmogor, Yakut Cattle, Bestuzhev, and Belorussian Red, and Southeast European
breeds: Busa, Podolian, and Ukrainian Grey). In addition,
we studied 22 samples from 3 different African breeds
from Ethiopia with unknown Bos indicus background
(Barka; morphological zebu-type, Raya; morphological
sanga-type, and Fogera; zebu-sanga intermediate). Cattle

samples originated from 6 different countries (Finland,
Russia, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Serbia, and Ethiopia). As references we studied 3 American bison individuals (Bison
bison) from one breeding stock, 6 European bison (Bison
bonasus) samples from Poland, and 4 yak (Bos grunniens)
samples from Russia. Other studied species included 14
sheep (Ovis aries) representing 6 different breeds from
Russia, Poland and Finland (Romanov breed, Wrzosowka
breed, Dagestan local, Andi, sheep from Komi village,
Finnsheep, and Ãlandsheep), 18 pigs (Sus scrofa) representing Large White, Landrace, Hampshire and Duroc
breeds, and 9 wild boar samples (Sus scrofa) from three
different Finnish wild boar farms. Individuals from the

same breed/species were sampled to be as unrelated as
possible. European bison is an endangered species and all
current animals (approximately 3200 individuals)
descend from 12 founder animals [26]. All the studied
species belong to the same order, Artiodactyla. Pig
belongs to the family Suidae, while all other species
belong to the family Bovidae. Cattle and yak are from the
genus Bos, while American and European bison belong to
genus Bison.
Genetic analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted from blood or semen samples using salting out procedure [27]. The prolactin receptor gene exon 10 was amplified in two fragments with the
same primer sets from cattle, yak, and bison samples.
Exon 10 from the pig and sheep samples was amplified in
one fragment. Primers were designed with the Primer3
http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/ using reference sequences [GenBank: NM_001039726 and DQ458765.1]. The PRLR
exon 10 sequence of the ruminant comprises of 891 bp
(297 aa), which was sequenced entirely, and that of the
pig is 1023 bp (341 aa) long, of which we sequenced 750
bp (250 aa). In addition, European bison and wild boar
GHR exon 10 were analysed using same methods and
primers as described in [10]. Primer sequences are available from TI-T upon request.

In polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 50 ng of genomic
DNA was used in 30 Î¼l volume of standard DYNAZyme II
(Finnzymes, Finland) PCR reaction mix. PCR products
were purified using ExoSAP-IT enzyme (GE Healthcare
Life sciences, UK). Sequencing reactions were performed
with DYEnamic ET Terminator Kit (GE Healthcare Life sciences, UK). The sequencing products were purified with
ethanol precipitation and separated on MegaBACE 1000
(Amersham Biosciences, UK). Each fragment was
sequenced on both strands and same primers were used
for the sequencing as for the fragment amplification.
Sequence data was base-called with Cimarron 3.12 basecaller in program MegaBACE Sequence analyzer v.
3.0.0111.1603 (Amersham Biosciences, UK). All
sequences were verified by visual inspection of chromatograms. Sequencher 4.6 (Gene Codes Corporation) was
used to align and correct sequences.
Statistical analysis
Haplotypes were reconstructed using the Bayesian haplotype reconstruction method for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from population genotype data
utilizing the program PHASE v.2.1.1 [28]. Reconstructions were done using 10000 iterations, 1 thinning interval and 1000 as burn-in period assuming a stepwise
mutation model. Animals that got haplotype pair probability lower than 0.95 were either cloned or discarded
from further analysis. Cloning was done with Zero BluntÂ®

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/172

TOPOÂ® PCR Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, USA) and Phusionâ¢
High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes, Finland) following manufacturer's instructions. Five or more clones
per individual were sequenced as described above using
universal M13-primers. Haplotypes were decided according to the result obtained from the cloning.
We estimated nucleotide diversity, Ï (pi, [29]) and Watterson's theta estimator, Î¸W [30] along the exon 10 and made
a sliding window plot from these two parameters among
18 vertebrate species. Pi and theta were calculated for 10
bp windows placed at 5 bp intervals using the following
sequences:

We calculated haplotype diversity (Hd), nucleotide diversity (pi) and Watterson's theta estimator for the studied
species separately using haplotype sequences obtained. Pi
is based on the average number of nucleotide differences
between the sequences and theta is based on the total
number of segregating sites in the sequence. To estimate
the effect of selection, we calculated Tajima's D [31], and
Fu and Li's D* and F* [32] for each species/subspecies
separately. Tajima's D test compares the differences
between the number of segregating sites and the average
number of pairwise differences [31]. Under neutrality,
Tajima's D value is assumed to be zero, under positive
selection there is an excess of rare polymorphisms and
Tajima's D value is negative. Negative D values can also be
due to population expansion. If there is balancing selection intermediate frequency genetic variants are kept and
Tajima's D value is positive. The same holds for the Fu and
Li's D* and F* tests. Confidence intervals for the Tajima's
D and Fu and Li's D* and F* values were obtained by generating 1000 independent coalescent simulations assuming no recombination. Statistical analysis package DnaSP
4.50.3 [33] was used to calculate Hd, Pi, Watterson's theta
estimator, Tajimas's D values and Fu and Li's D* and F*.
The impact of amino acid variants on protein structure via
analysis of multiple sequence alignments was done with
SIFT [13] and PolyPhen software [14]. SIFT uses sequence
homology to predict whether an amino acid substitution
will affect protein function and hence, potentially alter
phenotype. It gives normalized probability score value

Page 9 of 11

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:172

that the amino acid change is tolerated. If score value is
less than 0.05, amino acid change is predicted to be deleterious. Median conservation value for the diversity of the
sequences in the alignment is measured as well. The
default value is 3.0. Higher conservation values can lead
to higher false positive error [13]. PolyPhen uses sequence
alignments and protein 3D-structures for predictions. It
does profile analysis of homologous sequences using
BLAST search of the Non-Redundant DataBase (includes
PDB sequences, SWISS-PROT, SWISS-PROTupdate, PIR,
GenPept and GenPeptupdate). Sequence alignment is
used by the PSIC (position-specific independent counts)
software to calculate the profile matrix. Elements of the
matrix are logarithmic ratios of the likelihood of a given
amino acid occurring at a particular site to the likelihood
of this amino acid occurring at any site. It computes also
the absolute values of the difference between profile
scores of both allelic variants in the polymorphic position. PolyPhen uses empirically derived rules to predict
that an nsSNP is damaging or harmless i.e. most likely
lacking phenotypic effect. No sequences of the intercellular or transmembrane part of PRLR are available for bison
species and therefore analyses were done with the cytoplasmic part alone with these species. European and African cattle, pig and sheep were analyzed with the entire
protein sequence.
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for each SNP, as well as
linkage disequilibrium (LD as r2 [34]) between PRLR exon
10 SNPs and between GHR and PRLR SNPs was calculated
using Haploview 4.1 [35]. To generate a cladogram from
the PRLR gene DNA sequences, we used statistical parsimony method [36] that finds the tree that requires the
fewest evolutionary changes. This method is implemented
for the TCS1.21 program [37].
