Abstract
Background: The cataloging of marine prokaryotic DNA sequences is a fundamental aspect for
bioprospecting and also for the development of evolutionary and speciation models. However,
large amount of DNA sequences used to quantify prokaryotic biodiversity requires proper tools
for storing, managing and analyzing these data for research purposes.
Description: The Micro-Mar database has been created to collect DNA diversity information
from marine prokaryotes for biogeographical and ecological analyses. The database currently
includes 11874 sequences corresponding to high resolution taxonomic genes (16S rRNA, ITS and
23S rRNA) and many other genes including CDS of marine prokaryotes together with available
biogeographical and ecological information.
Conclusion: The database aims to integrate molecular data and taxonomic affiliation with
biogeographical and ecological features that will allow to have a dynamic representation of the
marine microbial diversity embedded in a user friendly web interface. It is available online at http:/
/egg.umh.es/micromar/.

Background
The global oceanic ecosystem is highly dependent on the
activity of its large population of prokaryotes. However,
their small size, relatively diluted environment and reluctance to be grown in pure culture make marine prokaryotes also one of the less known group of microbes. During
the last decade, PCR based approaches have produced an
enormous amount of information in this field, mostly
based on the 16S rRNA genes due to their accepted taxonomic relevance [1]. Other genes such as rpoB [2] and recA
[3] have started to be used on the grounds of their evolutionary stability. In recent years the sequencing of large

insert libraries such as BACs or Fosmids have produced an
important additional source of information. Last year, the
Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) applied to the Sargasso
Sea produced a sequence database of 1.045 billion base
pairs [4]. Still, many databases deal with only 16S or ITS
sequences. For example, the Ribosomal Database Project
counts 101632 entries corresponding to 16S sequences
[5] and RISSC has more than 1600 entries corresponding
to 16S-23S ribosomal spacer sequences [6]. While
genomic sequences submission is continuously growing,
there is not a clear correspondence in the improvement of

Micro-Mar is a novel database storing publicly available
marine prokaryotes sequences along with their biogeographical (sampling site, latitude, longitude etc.) and ecological information (depth, temperature, salinity etc.).
Each entry represents an individual marine prokaryote
with one or more DNA sequences coming from a particular sampling location and depth. The database aims not
only to provide a collection of marine prokaryotes data,
but also a research tool to relate microbial biodiversity
with its environment, opening possibilities for studying
adaptations at the level of the microbial community,
designing water management strategies, pollution detection or marine productivity prediction.

Construction and content
In order to retrieve marine prokaryotes sequences from
the NCBI [7], ad hoc queries were used. Moreover manual
sequence searches were also carried out. All the sequences
obtained were downloaded in GenBank format. Some of
the details, such as geographic origin, depth, temperature
etc., were obtained manually (if not available) by searching within the publications or by direct interaction with
the authors. Type of entry indicates whether a sequence
comes from offshore, inshore or sediments and a PCR
product, a cloned DNA product or an isolated strain. A
BLAST [8] search against Micro-Mar was performed in
order to get the closest marine prokaryotes sequence and
also the closest taxonomic unit (generally a pure culture).
Top fifty BLAST hits are also available on the webpage to
give more idea about the complete similarity profile for a
particular sequence. Top fifty BLAST hits to whole NCBI
nucleotide sequence database are also reported. The complete dataset was loaded in to MySQL [9] relational tables.
Micro-Mar uses LAMP: The Open Source Web Platform
[10]. Geographic Information System (GIS) uses JpGraph
library [11] to display different sampling locations on a
world map. All the web pages follow HTML 4.01 standard
and use CSS for consistent styling.

Utility
There are five major options available in the Micro-Mar
database: (i) search, (ii) GIS, (iii) local BLAST, (iv) MMSeqUp and (v) forum.
Search
The search option provides an interface for a large number
of queries to the database. It can be used to search the
database for 5S rRNA, 16S rRNA, ITS, 23S rRNA or CDS
sequences along with various biogeographical and ecological parameters. The results can be either in tabular format
or in a world map showing different sampling sites
through GIS. Each entry is linked back to other databases

such as NCBI for more information. A number of entries
can be selected to analyze further along with the given
sequences by aligning using CLUSTALW [12] and a tree
can be created using PHYLIP [13] to see the phylogenetic
position of submitted sequences against the Micro-Mar
sequences. Alignment files (PHYLIP format) and tree files
(Newick tree format, Postscript and PDF) are also available for download.
GIS
The GIS option provides an interface for selecting a particular sampling location on the world map and getting all
the sequences from that location and their details. Furthermore, for a selected region on the map, the following
information can be obtained, i) taxonomy report: taxonomic details at different levels (domain, phylum, class,
order, family and genus); ii) depth report: a plot showing
number of sequences vs depth; iii) biodiversity report: a
list of organisms found; iv) get all entries and v) advanced
search. The reports allow to retrieve sequences corresponding to a particular taxonomy, depth or biodiversity.
Local BLAST
The local BLAST option can be used to do a BLAST search
against Micro-Mar database to get the most similar
sequences to the submitted sequences. The results can be
either in default BLAST format or in a tabular format. All
the hits can be selected and displayed on the world map
using GIS and all the GIS features discussed above can be
used. Selected sequences can be downloaded in FASTA
Format and also analyzed further by aligning and creating
a tree along with the given sequences. Alignment and tree
files can also be downloaded in different formats as
described in the search option.
MMSeqUp
MMSeqUp facilitates online sequence submission to the
Micro-Mar database. It allows users to upload a file containing new marine prokaryotes sequences. Related biogeographical and ecological parameters can also be
submitted on the webpage.
Forum
An online forum powered by PHPBB [14] has been created for the following tasks: (i) FAQs: a compilation of frequently asked questions, (ii) suggestions, (iii) discussion:
open discussion and iv) feedback: comments on the
Micro-Mar web interface v) What's new: Recent developments in the database.

Discussion
Micro-Mar currently has 8187 entries consisting of 11874
sequences including 5693 16S rDNA, 2177 ITS, 170 23S
rDNA, 3448 CDS and one 5S rDNA. Micro-Mar sequences
cover 192 different sampling sites widespread on the

representing almost all the oceans (Figure 1). Inshore and
offshore representatives are also present demonstrating a
wide range of depth, going from surface water (0.5 m) to
the deepest of the Mariana Trench (10898 m). The entries
fall in two superkingdoms of Archea (959) and Bacteria
(6351). There is also a group of 877 unclassified entries.
Out of 8187 entries, 7672 entries i.e. more than 93% of
entries have complete geographic information available
in the database. Similarly more than 85% of entries have
depth information available. All the entries have taxonomic details linked back to the NCBI taxonomy database
[15]. The details of taxonomic distribution at phylum and
class level are summarized in Table 1 [see Additional file
1]. As expected in the marine environment, the biggest
taxonomic group is represented by the Proteobacteria
with all the 5 classes (α, β, γ, δ and ε) as shown in the

sequences and make it amenable for biogeographical and
ecological analyses. The database is updated every week to
include the most recent marine prokaryotic sequences. In
near future, more samples from extreme environments
will be integrated in the database to improve the analytical power and the biodiversity range. As more and more
entries are incorporated, it will be possible to correlate
accurately the bacterial biodiversity with biogeographical
and ecological parameters giving a global overview of the
various aspects of the biodiversity within the oceans. In
order to achieve this, it is encouraged that scientists
include more information about biogeographical and
ecological parameters while submitting their sequences to
various public databases.

Availability and requirements
The database is available at http://egg.umh.es/micromar/
. A latest web browser with JavaScript enabled is required
to use it.

Conclusion
The creation of Micro-Mar database is an initiative
towards cataloging all the information related to marine
prokaryotes collected during the lasts two decades and
providing an interface that will help the scientific community to do comparative analyses of marine prokaryotes
