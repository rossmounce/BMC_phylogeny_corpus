The phylogenomic analysis of the anaphase
promoting complex and its targets points to
complex and modern-like control of the cell cycle
in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes
Laura Eme1, Aurélie Trilles1, David Moreira2 and Céline Brochier-Armanet1,3*

Abstract
Background: The Anaphase Promoting Complex or Cyclosome (APC/C) is the largest member of the ubiquitin
ligase [E3] family. It plays a crucial role in the control of the cell cycle and cell proliferation by mediating the
proteolysis of key components by the proteasome. APC/C is made of a dozen subunits that assemble into a large
complex of ~1.5 MDa, which interacts with various cofactors and targets.
Results: Using comparative genomic and phylogenetic approaches, we showed that 24 out of 37 known APC/C
subunits, adaptors/co-activators and main targets, were already present in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor
(LECA) and were well conserved to a few exceptions in all present-day eukaryotic lineages. The phylogenetic
analysis of the 24 components inferred to be present in LECA showed that they contain a reliable phylogenetic
signal to reconstruct the phylogeny of the domain Eucarya.
Conclusions: Taken together our analyses indicated that LECA had a complex and highly controlled modern-like
cell cycle. Moreover, we showed that, despite what is generally assumed, proteins involved in housekeeping
cellular functions may be a good complement to informational genes to study the phylogeny of eukaryotes.

Background
The anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/
C) has been recently characterized as a member of the
ubiquitin ligase family (also referred as E3) (for a recent
review see [1]). E3s mediate the transfer of one or several ubiquitin monomers on a protein substrate in a
two-step reaction involving at least three partners. First,
an ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) activates and transfers ubiquitin to an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2).
Next, E3 mediates the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to a
lysine residue of the target protein. Both steps require
ATP. Most E3s are able to polyubiquitinate proteins by
adding new ubiquitin monomers to the first attached
one [2]. Polyubiquitinated proteins are targeted to the

26S proteasome for degradation, whereas mono-ubiquitinated proteins can be altered in their function or subcellular location by proteins containing ubiquitinbinding domains [2]. E3s are divided in several families
according to the presence of signature motifs. Among
them, E3s containing a HECT (Homologous to E6-AP
Carboxyl Terminus) domain receive ubiquitin from E2
before attaching it on the substrate, whereas E3s harboring a RING (Really Interesting New Gene) fingerdomain mediate the transfer of ubiquitin directly from
E2 to the substrate [2,3]. RING finger E3s form the largest family and may also contain a subunit with a Cullin
domain [1]. Among them, the APC/C is atypically large
(1.5 MDa) and complex, being composed of one or several copies of at least a dozen subunits and of various
adaptors/co-activators (Figure 1) [4]. The function of
the APC/C has been extensively studied in animals and
yeast, where it was shown to have a critical role in cell

Figure 1 Schematic structure of the APC/C. The APC/C is divided in three parts: the structural complex composed of three subunits (in pink),
the TPR arm made of nine proteins (in blue) and a second arm (the catalytic arm) made of three proteins (in green) interacting with the E2
protein (in purple) and the substrate (in grey). The activity and specificity of the APC/C is modulated by various adaptor/co-activators (in orange).
The location of Apc14 (in black) remains uncertain. The presence of RING finger and Cullin conserved functional domains, and of TPR and WD
repeats is indicated.

cycle progression through the tight control of degradation of key proteins (e.g. mitotic cyclins, anaphase inhibitors, spindle proteins, regulatory kinases, inhibitors of
DNA replication, etc.) [5,6].
Electron microscopy observations, in vitro assays,
genetic experiments and structural studies have shed
light on the composition, structural organization, assembly and molecular activity of the APC/C (Table 1 and
Figure 1) [1,4,7]. The APC/C core is divided in three
functional parts: i) the structural complex, which is
made of Apc1, Apc4 and Apc5 subunits (in pink, Figure
1), serves as scaffold; ii) the catalytic arm (in green, Figure 1) that houses the E2-binding site is made of Apc10
and of the Apc2 and Apc11 proteins that contain the
Cullin and RING finger domains, respectively; and iii)
the TPR arm (in blue, Figure 1) allows positioning both
the E2 and the substrate in order to promote the ubiquitin transfer. This second arm is composed of four
subunits (Apc3, Apc6, Apc7, and Apc8) containing tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) and of several accessory

proteins (Apc9, Apc12, Apc13, and Apc15, the last two
being essential in Schizosaccharomyces pombe [8]). It
has been proposed that the TPR repeats interact with
the isoleucine- and arginine-rich motifs found in the Cterminal regions of adaptors/co-activators (see [1] and
references therein for additional details). The TPR arm
may also contain Apc16, a subunit recently reported by
the MitoCheck consortium [9]. Finally, the location of
Apc14, a yeast essential subunit [8] remains
undetermined.
The APC/C activity and specificity are modulated by
several adaptors/co-activators (Cdc20, Cdh1, Ama1,
Mfr1, Rap and Cortex) (Table 1 and Figure 1) [7,10].
These are paralogous proteins containing WD-repeats
that mediate the interaction between the APC/C and
the D-, KEN-, A- or O-boxes present on target substrates (see [11] and references therein). Among those
adaptors, Cdc20 and Cdh1 are the most important,
being directly involved in the activation and substrate
selectivity of the APC/C at different stages of the cell

cycle (reviewed in [1,6,7]). The interaction of the APC/C
and either Cdc20 (in early-mid-mitosis) or Cdh1 (during
late-mitosis and G1-S transition) is strongly dependent
on the high or low activity of Cdks (Cyclin dependent
kinases) [6]. Briefly, Cdc20 activates the APC/C during
early mitosis once the chromosomes are properly
attached and bi-oriented at the metaphase plate during
a process known as the spindle assembly checkpoint
[12]. The APC/C-Cdc20 targets securins and cyclins B1
towards destruction by the proteasome. The degradation
of these two proteins promotes the activation of
separases, which then cleave the cohesin complex (CC)
leading to the separation of sister chromatids and the
initiation of the anaphase [6,12,13]. During anaphase,
the APC/C -Cdh1 targets Polo-like kinase 1, Aurora
kinases, mitotic cyclins and Cdc20 towards degradation
leading to the exit of mitosis. The APC/C-Cdh1 remains
active during the G1/S phase ensuring the degradation
by the 26S proteasome of several inhibitors of DNA
replication, thus allowing the synthesis of DNA [7]. At
the end of the S phase, the increase of the activity of
Cdks inhibits the interaction between Cdh1 and the
APC/C complex, precluding new rounds of DNA synthesis [1]. By contrast, other APC/C activators seem to
have more restricted roles: Ama1 is required for sporulation and during the anaphase of meiosis I in budding
yeast [7,14]; Mfr1 acts at the end of meiosis II in S.
pombe [10]; Cortex encodes a putative Drosophila melanogaster female meiosis-specific co-activator of the
APC/C prior to the metaphase I arrest [15] and, finally,
Rap (retina aberrant in pattern) mediates the degradation of cyclins during the development of eye imaginal
discs in D. melanogaster [16].
If most of the APC/C studies have been carried out in
yeast and animals, recent experiments with the land
plant Arabidopsis thaliana have allowed the identification of 12 transcribed genes that are homologous to vertebrate and yeast APC/C subunits and of eight Cdh1/
Cdc20 homologues (Table 1) [17-20]. By contrast, very
little information is available for representatives of the
other major eukaryotic lineages. The only exception
concerns the kinetoplastid species Trypanosoma brucei,
shown to encode seven APC/C subunit homologues in
its genome (Table 1) [21]. The apparent conservation of
components of the APC/C in these few distantly related
eukaryotes opens the question of the origin and evolution of this atypically large and complex ubiquitin-ligase.
To tackle this issue, we carried out an in-depth analysis
of 16 APC/C subunits and six adaptors/co-activators
(Table 1) in all eukaryotic lineages for which representatives with complete (or nearly complete) genome
sequences were available (Figure 2). We also included in
our study several major direct or indirect targets of
APC/C, namely the separase, the securin, cyclins A and

Page 4 of 14

B, Cdks-1 and -2 and the nine components of the cohesin complex (Table 2). The phylogenomic analysis of
these proteins supports that most of them were present
in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA), indicating that this organism likely possessed a highly controlled cell cycle that may have been very similar to that
of present-day eukaryotes. Finally our analyses indicate
that APC/C components and targets carry a bona fide
phylogenetic signal that can be used to trace back the
evolutionary history of the eukaryotic domain.

Results and Discussion
Most APC/C components and main targets were present
in LECA

We used a phylogenomic approach [22] in order to
study the origin and evolution of APC/C and its main
targets in eukaryotes. The first step consisted in the survey of complete (or nearly complete) genome sequences
available in public databases to retrieve homologues of
each component of this system. Working on complete
genomes ensures the rigorous inference of the presence
or absence of homologues in each genome. Then, phylogenetic analyses allow inferring the origin and the subsequent evolution of each component.
We searched for orthologues in 65 taxa representing
the eukaryotic diversity (all major groups were present
except Rhizaria and Cryptophyta). More precisely, our
taxonomic sampling covered (i) Holozoa (represented by
Metazoa, and their close relatives the Choanoflagellata
and Capsaspora), (ii) Fungi (with three main lineages:
Dikarya, Chytridiomycota and Microsporidia) and (iii)
Apusozoa. Whereas the position of Apusozoa remains
uncertain, Metazoa, their unicellular allies and Fungi
represent the opisthokont lineage that together with
Amoebozoa, form one of the two putative major divisions of eukaryotes, the Unikonta [23]. The other major
division, the Bikonta, was represented in our study by
genomes from Excavata, Heterokonta, Apicomplexa and
Ciliata (two main groups within the Alveolata), Haptophyta, and Viridiplantae and Rhodophyta (two main
Plantae lineages) (Figure 2).
At this step, it is interesting to notice that, except for
adaptors/co-activators and a few other exceptions, we
identified at most only one homologue of each APC/C
component and main target coding genes in each genome (Additional file 1, Table S1 and Additional file 2,
Table S2). In addition, some of them were found only in
very restricted sets of species. For example, orthologues
of Apc14 and of two subunits of the TPR arm (Apc9
and Apc15) were present only in a few ascomycetes
(Table 1 and Additional file 1, Table S1) suggesting that
they are recent innovations that emerged after the first
diversification of fungi (Figure 2). The TPR arm protein
Apc16 may be even more recent because it was present

in-between Unikonta and Bikonta [23] showing the relationships between the eleven major eukaryotic lineages for which complete (or nearly
complete) genome sequences are available [56,63,64,78]. Holozoa are representated by Capsaspora, Choanoflagellata and Metazoa (in pink);

ongoing (accordingly the loss of some components inferred in the corresponding lineages should be confirmed when complete genome
sequences are available). LECA (grey circle) represents the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor. Based on phylogenetic analyses, we inferred the
time of appearance or loss of orthologues of APC/C subunits (dark blue), activators (light blue) and main targets (pink). For each lineage, protein
gains and losses are indicated by green and red arrows, respectively.

100, > 50, and < 50 indicate that at least one orthologue has been detected respectively in all, at least 50%, and less than 50% of the studied genomes for a
given lineage.

only in the two Gnathostomata representatives within
metazoa (Table 1 and Figure 2). By contrast, based on
ML and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses (Additional file
3, Data S1), we identified orthologues of the other 12
APC/C subunits and of two adaptors/co-activators in at
least two bikont and two unikont major lineages, indicating that they were likely present in LECA (Table 1
and Figure 2). Accordingly, their absence in any present-day genome should be interpreted as secondary
loss. This is for instance the case of the six subunits
composing the catalytic arm and the structural complex,
for which we detected homologues in all opisthokonts
but choanoflagellates, which ancestrally missed Apc11
and Apc5, suggesting ancient losses in this lineage. Similarly, whereas the four main subunits of the TPR arm
(Apc3, Apc6, Apc7 and Apc8) were inferred to be present in the ancestor of opisthokonts, Apc7 was missing
in ascomycete and basidiomycete representatives suggesting a secondary loss in the ancestor of these two
fungal groups after their separation from chytrids.
Regarding the other proteins associated to the TPR arm,
beside the case of Apc9, Apc15 and Apc16 already mentioned, homologues of Apc12 and Apc13 were poorly
represented in opisthokonts. More precisely they were
missing in choanoflagellates, Capsaspora, most fungi
and some animals. However, the presence of Apc12 and
Apc13 orthologues also in some bikont lineages indicated that these subunits were present in LECA and
thus in the ancestor of opisthokonts. Accordingly, their
poor taxonomic distribution in this eukaryotic lineage
results from convergent secondary losses (Figure 2).
Finally, orthologues of the two adaptors Cdc20 and

Cdh1 were present in all opisthokonts. Among them,
the case of Microsporidia deserved attention. Indeed,
whereas only one APC/C subunit (Apc10, located in the
catalytic arm) had previously been reported in Encephalitozoon cuniculi [24], we additionally found orthologues
of one component of the structural complex (Apc1),
three of the TPR arm (Apc3, Apc6 and Apc8) and of
two adaptors/co-activators (Cdh1 and Cdc20) in genomes of four representatives of this group of highly
derived parasitic anaerobic fungi. The conservation of at
least one component of each functional part of the
APC/C suggested that a minimalist version of the APC/
C might exist in Microsporidia. More drastic losses
were observed in the anaerobic parasite Entamoeba histolytica where the absence of all but four components
contrasted with the conservation of all 14 subunits and
adaptors/co-activators inferred to be present in LECA in
the second amoebozoan studied (the free-living Dictyostelium discoideum) (Table 1 and Figure 2). Such massive
losses were also observed for the parasitic excavate
Giardia intestinalis. However, in contrast with Microsporidia, the more reduced set of components and,
more precisely, the absence of all proteins composing
the TPR arm appeared less compatible with a fully
operational APC/C system in these two anaerobic
parasites.
In bikonts, orthologues of the 12 components inferred
to be present in LECA were also inferred to be present
in the ancestors of Plantae and Heterokonta (Figure 2).
However, in red algae, the haptophyte Emiliania huxleyi,
ciliates and most excavates, a slightly more restricted set
of proteins was observed (Table 1). Notably, none of

Eme et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:265
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/265

them harboured the Apc5 subunit of the structural
complex, along with two components of the TPR arm
(Apc12 and Apc13), whereas we detected Apc4 only in
the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila and the haptophyte
E. huxleyi, and Apc7 in the excavate Trichomonas vaginalis (Table 1). This suggested that the great similarity
observed in the distribution of APC/C components in
these four major eukaryotic lineages was likely due to
convergent losses during their evolution (Figure 2). The
situation was completely different in Apicomplexa, the
second main lineage of alveolates in our dataset together
with ciliates. While the three ciliates have retained a
large number of components inferred to be present in
LECA (Table 1), most of them have been lost in Apicomplexa (Table 1). More specifically, all APC/C proteins were missing in Babesia bovis and Theileria
annulata, whereas the remaining four apicomplexan
species harboured only four or five of them. Surprisingly, components present in those organisms were
diverse depending on the species (Table 1). For instance,
Apc10, Apc11 and Apc1 were found in Toxoplasma
gondii, whereas the two Plasmodium species contained
orthologues of Apc10, Apc11, Apc3 and the anaerobic
Cryptosporidium hominis harboured Apc1, Apc11, Apc3,
Apc6 and Apc8 (Additional file 1, Table S1). The presence of nearly all components in ciliates indicated that
massive and differential losses occurred secondarily in
Apicomplexa (Figure 2). As mentioned above, such massive losses were also observed in the excavate G. intestinalis and in the amoebozoan E. histolytica (Additional
file 1, Table S1). However, it is important to note that
when orthologues existed in these lineages, they showed
highly divergent sequences compared to those found in
other eukaryotic lineages (not shown). It is thus possible
that orthologues of some components might have
escaped detection (despite the use of PSI-BLAST
searches) because of their extreme degree of sequence
divergence. In any case, the possible massive losses or
the high divergence of APC/C components both suggested that important changes have occurred relatively
recently in these parasitic lineages, maybe as a consequence of their atypical cell division mechanism. This is
notably the case of Theileria that, acting like a disguised
chromosome during host cell division, inserts itself into
both daughter cells by co-opting parts of the host cell
division machinery, in particular the host cell’s microtubules to be pulled towards the opposing ends of the
dividing cell [25].
An interesting evolutionary pattern emerged from our
analyses concerning the APC/C adaptors/co-activators.
Their phylogenies supported that only the two paralogues Cdc20 and Cdh1 were present in LECA and conserved in nearly all eukaryotic lineages (even in
Microsporidia), whereas all the remaining co-activators

Page 7 of 14

resulted from independent duplications that occurred
recently in different eukaryotic lineages (Additional file
4, Figure S1 and Additional file 5, Figure S2). For
instance, Rap and Cortex resulted from duplications of
Cdh1 and Cdc20, respectively, which occurred in D.
melanogaster, whereas Ama1 and Mfr1 derived from
duplications of Cdc20 in Ascomycota and Cdh1 in S.
pombe, respectively. Within plants, our analyses confirmed the presence of multiple Cdc20 and Cdh1 copies
in A. thaliana, but also in other land plants (Oryza
sativa, Selaginella moellendorfii and Physcomitrella
patens) (Additional file 1, Table S1) [19]. Phylogenetic
analyses suggested that the numerous homologues
observed in these plants arose from independent duplications (Additional file 4, Figure S1 and Additional file
5, Figure S2). In A. thaliana, the various Cdc20 and
Cdh1 paralogues have been shown to be differently
expressed through the cell cycle and depending on cell
types or tissues [19], suggesting that subfunctionalization events occurred after the duplications. More intriguing was the huge expansion of the repertory of
adaptor/co-activators observed in the two ciliates T.
thermophila and Paramecium tetraurelia, for which we
identified eight and ten copies of Cdh1, respectively.
Among excavates, Leishmania and Trypanosoma genomes encoded only one adaptor/co-activator affiliated to
the Cdc20 subfamily (Table 1), whereas the genome of
Naegleria (as in most eukaryotes) encoded one Cdc20
and one Cdh1 copies. The genome of Trichomonas contained three homologues but due to their great divergence we were unable to classify them as Cdc20 or
Cdh1 without ambiguity (Additional file 1, Table S1).
Finally, in G. intestinalis as in some apicomplexa (Babesia, Theileria and Toxoplasma), we failed to detect any
adaptor/co-activator, reinforcing the hypothesis that
their APC/C proteins have experienced a very divergent
and fast evolution.
Regarding the main APC/C targets, our phylogenetic
analyses were not conclusive in the case of cyclins A
and B and Cdks-1 and -2 to determine whether they
were found in LECA or not because these proteins
belonged to very large multigenic families with complex
evolutionary histories precluding a precise inference of
their evolutionary origin (not shown). For the remaining
targets, our analyses allowed inferring that the separase
and the nine subunits composing the CC (i.e. the core
complex, associated proteins, the loading complex and
the proteins involved in the cohesion establishment)
were present in LECA (Table 2 and Additional file 2,
Table S2) and have been conserved in most eukaryotic
lineages (Table 2 and Figure 2). The taxonomic distribution of Smc1, Smc3, Scc1, Scc3 and Psd5 homologues
was globally in agreement with a previous study focused
on the analysis of 29 genes involved in meiosis in

Eme et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:265
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/265

eukaryotes [26]. In contrast, Scc4 (a protein composing
the loading complex) and Wpl1/Rad61 (a protein that
forms together with Psd5 a complex involved in CC
maintenance [12,13]) were present only in Viridiplantae and in Opisthokonta suggesting convergent losses
in other lineages (Table 2 and Figure 2). However, it
can also be speculated that these proteins are not
under strong selective pressure, as attested by the fast
evolutionary rate of Wpl1/Rad61 found in Saccharomycetaceae that are shorter and highly divergent compared to those of metazoa (647 versus 1190 amino
acids, 14% identity and 29% similarity between yeast
(NP_010297) and human (NP_055860) sequences). So
it would even be possible that they have been replaced
by non-homologous proteins in other lineages. The
only targets of APC/C that were not inferred to be
present in LECA are securins that were found only in
Metazoa and Fungi. However, even though they fulfil
the same function (preventing the separation of the
two sister chromatids) through the binding of
separases that are homologous in metazoan and fungal
species, fungal securins are not homologous to those
from metazoa [27], suggesting again a non-homologous
replacement in one of these two groups (Table 1 and
Figure 2).
Functional data point to a nearly modern APC/C
controlling the cell cycle in LECA

Our phylogenomic analysis of the APC/C, its main
adaptors/co-activators and targets supported the hypothesis that most of the corresponding genes were already
present in LECA. It was therefore tempting to conclude
that a complex similar to the one involved in presentday regulation of the eukaryotic cell cycle was already
present in this ancestral organism. Supporting this
hypothesis, nearly all the proteins under study possessed
conserved functional domains similar to those present
in components that were experimentally proved to be
part of the APC/C or targeted by this ubiquitin ligase
(Additional file 6, Table S3 and Additional file 7, Table
S4). This indicated that all the identified orthologues of
APC/C components and targets had similar molecular
functions. Moreover, experimental data from plants and
excavates have shown that most components identified
by our analysis were part of or targeted by the APC/C
[18-21,28-35]. This strongly suggested that they inherited their function from the ancestral proteins present
in LECA, and therefore that a nearly modern APC/C
and control of the cell cycle existed in LECA. This also
suggested that, in lineages for which no functional data
were available, the orthologues that we have identified
were likely involved in the control of the cell cycle and,
therefore, may constitute interesting targets for experimental work.

Page 8 of 14

Although the origin of most APC/C components and
targets could be traced back to LECA and most of them
have been conserved throughout the evolution of eukaryotes, some component gains could also be observed.
Most of them resulted from gene duplications of adaptors/co-activators that occurred independently in different lineages. This was in agreement with recent reports
of new, and often specific, activities of the APC/C in
some eukaryotes (e.g. the neuronal activity [36] or the
early eye development [16], or the progression of the
endocycle in flowering plant endosperm [18,20]). This
suggested that most of the APC/C evolution since
LECA has concerned the acquisition of new regulatory
functions by increasing the repertoire of adaptors/coactivators, even if we can not rule out the possibility
that adaptors/co-activators present in single copies in
some lineages were (and still are) able to interact with a
larger spectrum of targets than their multiple-copies
counterparts. In addition to the classical activators/coactivators, a recent interactomic study in A. thaliana
suggested the presence of three novel APC/C interactors
specific to land plants that were not homologous to the
Cdc20/Cdh1 family [34]. However, although they interacted with the APC/C, their biological function (e.g.
adaptor/co-activators, inhibitors, targets, etc.) has still
not been established. Nevertheless, this supported that
lineage-specific innovations are expected to be discovered when biological data on a broader diversity of
eukaryotes becomes available.
In contrast, we also observed that convergent events
of streamlining occurred secondarily in various lineages,
like Apicomplexa, G. lamblia and E. histolytica. The
reasons explaining those massive loss events are unclear,
though we could not discard that, at least for a number
of cases, they might be linked to an extreme acceleration of their evolutionary rate beyond detection. This
hypothesis was supported by the high evolutionary rates
exhibited by the few components still harboured by Apicomplexa. However, the detection of APC/C subunits
and targets in fast evolving organisms, like E. cuniculi
and T. vaginalis, rather suggested that most of the missing components in G. lamblia, E. histolytica and Apicomplexa, reflected true losses. In that case we could
wonder whether the lost components have been
replaced by non homologous proteins that fulfil the
same role or whether these parasites are able to recruit
the APC/C components from their hosts. In both cases,
experimental investigations in these parasitic lineages
will be useful to elucidate the nature of their APC/C or
even to discover putative divergent systems involved in
the control of the cell cycle that may provide interesting
medical drug targets. Likewise, a previous phylogenomic
study of proteins involved in late cytokinesis revealed a
similar pattern of reductive evolution in these lineages

Eme et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:265
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/265

[37]. Indeed, E. histolytica, G. lamblia and Apicomplexa
have undergone massive losses of proteins of the cytokinesis machinery, including conserved ancient ones
inferred to have been present in LECA [37]. This information combined to our present analysis suggests that
major changes have occurred in various steps of the cell
cycle in these parasitic eukaryotes.
Most components of the APC/C and targets are
eukaryotic innovations

Despite our extensive survey of public sequence databases, we did not identify any homologue of the APC/C
components in prokaryotes with two exceptions. This
indicated that this large E3 complex and its main targets
are eukaryotic innovations that emerged after the
separation of this domain from prokaryotes but prior to
its diversification into the present-day eukaryotic
lineages. The two exceptions, Smc1 and Smc3, are two
paralogous proteins that are part of the core complex of
the cohesin complex (Table 1). According to previous
reports and to their critical role in higher-order chromosome organization and dynamics [38,39], we identified homologues of Smc1 and Smc3 in nearly all
archaeal and bacterial lineages (not shown). The lack of
APC/C prokaryotic homologues was surprising because
distant homologues harbouring structures similar to
eukaryotic ubiquitin, E1 and E2 exist in prokaryotes [40]
and because a bona fide homologue of the eukaryotic
proteasome has been described in Archaea and Actinobacteria [41,42]. Moreover, it was recently reported that
homologues of the eukaryotic ubiquitination pathway
are encoded in the genome of the archaeon ‘Candidatus
Caldiarchaeum subterraneum’ [43], a relative of the
recently proposed phylum Thaumarchaeota [44]. This
system is composed of a cluster of four genes coding for
the ubiquitin, E1-like and E2-like enzymes and a small
Zn RING finger protein [43]. The first three proteins
are much more similar to their eukaryotic counterparts
than to the very distant homologues usually found in
prokaryotes. Since no bona fide homologue of E3
enzymes has been identified in this archaeon, it was proposed that the fourth protein might mediate the ligation
of ubiquitin [43]. Despite this recent discovery, our analyses together with data from the literature suggested
that the vast majority of APC/C components and main
targets were eukaryotic innovations that may have
played a role in the emergence and evolution of the
complex cell cycle observed in this domain.
APC/C components and main targets can be used to infer
the phylogeny of eukaryotes

Proteins inferred to have been present in LECA are
valuable material to reconstruct the characteristics of
this ancestral organism (e.g. [37,45-49]). In addition,

Page 9 of 14

they can preserve a phylogenetic signal useful to infer
the evolutionary history of eukaryotes. Until now, most
analyses dedicated to the reconstruction of the eukaryotic phylogeny were based on the analysis of components
of informational systems (those involved in the transmission and expression of the genetic information). This
was so because most of the genes coding for these proteins present the advantage of being (i) part of monogenic gene families allowing the easy identification of
orthologous proteins, (ii) slowly evolving, (iii) ancient
and well conserved among life domains, and (iv) rarely
exchanged by horizontal gene transfers. Accordingly,
they represent first choice material to investigate ancient
evolution in all domains of life [50-53]. Phylogenetic
studies of the eukaryotic domain did not escape this
rule and most of them have been largely based on the
phylogenetic analysis of informational proteins (e.g.,
[51,54-57]). By contrast, most proteins involved in
housekeeping functions (operational proteins) are considered to evolve faster than those of informational systems, and thus to be less suitable to study ancient
evolution. Moreover, they are often part of large and
complex protein families that have experienced numerous gene duplication and loss events during their evolutionary history, meaning that distinguishing between
orthologues and paralogues is difficult and requires fastidious preliminary analyses. Consequently, although
these proteins are more numerous than informational
ones and often of larger size, they have rarely been used
to infer the ancient evolution of eukaryotes. Nevertheless, typical datasets based on informational proteins
have been shown to be insufficient to robustly infer all
the deep nodes of the global eukaryotic phylogenies
[58,59]. Increasing the protein sampling is therefore
becoming as necessary as increasing the taxonomic sampling in order to fully resolve the phylogeny of eukaryotes, meaning that new useful protein markers have to
be found among the conserved operational proteins.
Our phylogenetic analyses of the APC/C subunits and
main targets showed that with a few exceptions they are
ancient proteins well conserved throughout the diversity
of present day eukaryotic lineages. Accordingly, they are
potential suitable markers to reconstruct global eukaryotic phylogenies. The maximum likelihood and Bayesian
phylogenetic analyses of individual components showed
that they have retained ancient phylogenetic signal
despite the fact that some basal nodes of the inferred
phylogenies showed a poor resolution (a typical result in
single-marker analyses) (Additional file 3, Data S1). To
increase resolution, we built a supermatrix (3115 positions) by concatenating the individual alignments of the
24 APC/C components and main targets inferred to be
present in LECA. To minimise potential long-branch
attraction (LBA) tree reconstruction artefacts [60], we

Eme et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:265
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/265

discarded at this step the extremely fast evolving and/or
very partial sequences of Enterocytozoon bieneusi
(Microsporidia), Plasmodium spp. (Apicomplexa) and B.
hominis (Heterokonta), all them having > 60% of missing data. We also discarded T. vaginalis (Excavata)
because this species contained multiple (and often divergent) copies of several APC/C components and main
targets. The resulting Bayesian and maximum likelihood
trees recovered the monophyly of each eukaryotic phyla
and most often supported by high Bayesian posterior
probabilities (PP) and maximum likelihood bootstrap
values (BV): Discicristata (PP = 0.98; BV = 97%), Heterokonta (PP = 1.0; BV = 100%), Metazoa (PP = 1.0; BV
= 100%), Fungi (PP = 0.87; BV = 98%), Choanoflagellata
(PP = 1.0; BV = 100%), Viridiplantae (PP = 1.0; BV =
99%) and Alveolata (PP = 0.95 and BV = 78%) (Figure
3). The most remarkable result was the good support
retrieved for the monophyly of Fungi, including the
extremely fast evolving Microsporidia. The APC/C proteins are therefore among the rare ones [61] that support the correct phylogenetic placement of these
parasites as members of the Fungi.
Regarding the relationships among the main eukaryotic groups, the sister-grouping of the two choanoflagellates and C. owczarzaki was supported both by the
Bayesian (PP = 0.88) and maximum likelihood (BV =
87%) trees; these two groups being closely related to
Metazoa (namely, a support for the Holozoa with PP =
0.97 and BV = 100%). This was in agreement with previous results [62,63], but not with those supporting the
emergence of Capsaspora at the base of the group composed of Choanoflagellata and Metazoa [64,65]. The
phylogenetic signal contained in APC/C components
and main targets also supported the monophyly of
Opisthokonta (PP = 0.91; BV = 100%). Moreover, if we
accept the putative unikont-bikont rooting [23], our
analyses also retrieved the Unikonta, including the apusozoan Thecamonas trahens, albeit with a weaker support (PP = 0.81; BV = 78%). Similarly, most of the
relationships among bikont lineages were poorly
resolved (Figure 3). In particular, the monophyly of
Plantae was not recovered: green plants and algae
appeared closely related to the haptophyte E. huxleyi
(PP = 0.78; BV = 81%), whereas the phylogenetic position of red algae was not resolved. This agreed with
other studies showing the difficulty to retrieve the
monophyly of Plantae, even with much larger datasets
(e.g., [66]). Finally, heterokonts formed the sister group
of green plants and haptophytes (PP = 0.89; BV =
100%).
Taken together, our phylogenetic analyses showed that
despite the relative small size of the supermatrix constructed with the APC/C components and main targets
(3115 positions), it contained an interesting phylogenetic

Page 10 of 14

signal that can be useful to infer part of the ancient evolutionary history of eukaryotes. However, the large size
of most of the APC/C subunits and main targets made
difficult the use of the abundant body of sequence data
coming from the analysis of expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) because of their incomplete sequence coverage,
which limited our taxonomic sampling. Nevertheless,
our dataset can now be employed as a reference to
enrich it with assembled EST sequences as well as with
those from upcoming complete genome sequences from
various protist species. This limitation will likely apply
to other operational proteins candidates to be used as
markers for the reconstruction of global eukaryotic phylogenies but, as already discussed, their inclusion in
multi-marker analyses becomes crucial to infer several
deep nodes that the traditional supermatrices of informational proteins have failed to resolve.

Conclusions
Our analyses of the APC/C and its main targets showed
that this complex system was very likely present in
LECA and has been conserved, to a few exceptions, all
along the diversification of the eukaryotic domain. This
study provided first insights into the mechanisms
responsible of the control of the cell cycle in LECA, suggesting that it was tightly regulated like in present-day
eukaryotes. Finally we showed that the components of
the APC/C and its main targets can be good phylogenetic markers to complement those used so far (mostly
proteins involved in transcription and translation).
Indeed, the latter have proven not to be sufficient to
fully resolve the phylogeny of eukaryotes, making necessary to identify new complementary markers. This will
certainly be a difficult task that will require many analyses but we think that the phylogenomic study of conserved cellular systems is a promising approach to
tackle this issue.
Methods
Dataset assembly

We used the 37 APC/C components and main targets
identified in four opisthokont species (Homo sapiens, D.
melanogaster, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe [7,11]), the
plant A. thaliana [17,19] and the kinetoplastid T. brucei
[21] (Table 1) to survey public sequence databases. We
identified homologues of these proteins using BLASTp
and PSI-BLAST (with default parameters) [67] in a subset of complete or ongoing genomes representative of
eukaryotic diversity available at the NCBI (Figure 2). To
increase the taxonomic sampling, homologues of Monosiga brevicollis, Salpingoeca rosetta, Lottia gigantea,
Nematostella vectensis, Helobdella robusta, Daphnia

http://merolae.biol.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/blast/blast.html.
BLAST outputs were examined by eye to identify homologues of each protein to avoid applying an arbitrary
cutoff on e-value or score. To ensure an exhaustive
sampling of homologues, we performed additional
searches using as seeds homologues that were identified

at previous steps. The absence of any homologue in a
given lineage was systematically verified by hand using
tBLASTn searches on the nucleotide sequences of the
corresponding complete genomes.
For each protein, the homologous sequences were
gathered in a dataset and aligned with MAFFT 6.833
[69]. All the resulting alignments were edited and manually adjusted using the ED program from the MUST
package [70]. Regions where homology between sites
was doubtful were manually removed from the alignments before phylogenetic analyses. A supermatrix was
built by concatenating the alignments corresponding to
the 24 APC/C components, adaptor/co-activators and
targets inferred to be present in LECA.
Conserved functional domain search

The identification of functional domains was carried out
using the HMMER package [71] and the HMM profiles
of the Pfam database [72]. HMM profiles having evalues lower than 0.1 were considered as significant.
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed for each single
protein dataset, except for Apc9, Apc14, Apc15, Apc16
and securin because of their very restricted number of
homologues. Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic
trees were computed using Treefinder [73] with the LG
model [74] and a gamma correction to take into account
the heterogeneity of evolutionary rates across sites (4
discrete classes of sites and estimated alpha parameter),
as proposed by the model selection tool implemented in
Treefinder. The branch robustness of ML trees was estimated using the non parametric bootstrap procedure
(100 replicates of the original alignment) implemented
in Treefinder with the same parameters than for ML
tree inference. Bayesian trees were computed using
MrBAYES 3.1.2 [75] with a mixed amino acid substitution model and a gamma correction (four rate categories). The Markov chain Monte Carlo search was run
with 4 chains for 1, 000, 000 generations, with trees
being sampled every 100 generations (the first 2, 500
trees were discarded as ‘’burn-in’’). Individual Bayesian
trees are provided as Additional file 3, Data S1.
TreeFinder and PhyloBayes 3.2 [76] were used to perform ML and Bayesian analyses on the concatenated
dataset. Treefinder was run with the same parameters
than for the analysis of single datasets. Phylobayes was
run using the CAT model and a gamma correction with
4 rate categories [77]. For each dataset, two independent
chains were run for at least 10000 cycles, saving one
tree in ten. The first 300 trees were discarded as “burnin”, and the remaining trees from each chain in each
dataset were used to test for convergence and compute
the 50% majority rule consensus tree.

Inference of the origin of APC/C components and main
targets

The phylogenetic analysis of each individual component
allowed distinguishing orthologues that originated from
speciation events from paralogues that resulted from
gene duplications. This point is important because inferring the evolutionary origin of a protein requires the
analysis of the evolutionary history of orthologues. To
determine the origin of each component and subunit,
we used a parsimony criterion, making the assumption
that horizontal gene transfers between eukaryotes are
rare. Accordingly, the ancestral absence of a component
in the ancestor of a taxonomic group was inferred if no
orthologues are found in any present-day representative
of the group (even in those that were not included in
our taxonomic sampling). By contrast, the presence of
orthologues in representatives of two lineages was interpreted as the existence of the corresponding component
in their last common ancestor. Similarly, the presence of
a component in an ancestral taxon was also inferred if
orthologues are present in at least one representative of
its offspring and in one of its ancestors.
