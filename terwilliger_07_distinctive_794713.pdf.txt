Abstract
Background: A diverse set of transcripts called 185/333 is strongly expressed in sea urchins
responding to immune challenge. Optimal alignments of full-length 185/333 cDNAs requires the
insertion of large gaps that define 25 blocks of sequence called elements. The presence or absence
of individual elements also defines a specific element pattern for each message. Individual sea urchins
were challenged with pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (lipopolysaccharide, β-1,3glucan, or double stranded RNA), and changes in the 185/333 message repertoire were followed
over time.
Results: Each animal expressed a diverse set of 185/333 messages prior to challenge and a 0.96
kb message was the predominant size after challenge. Sequence analysis of the cloned messages
indicated that the major element pattern expressed in immunoquiescent sea urchins was either C1
or E2.1. In contrast, most animals responding to lipopolysaccharide, β-1,3-glucan or injury,
predominantly expressed messages of the E2 pattern. In addition to the major patterns, extensive
element pattern diversity was observed among the different animals before and after challenge.
Nucleotide sequence diversity of the transcripts increased in response to β-1,3-glucan, double
stranded RNA and injury, whereas diversity decreased in response to LPS.
Conclusion: These results illustrate that sea urchins appear to be able to differentiate among
different PAMPs by inducing the transcription of different sets of 185/333 genes. Furthermore,
animals may share a suite of 185/333 genes that are expressed in response to common pathogens,
while also maintaining a large number of unique genes within the population.

Background
Recent advances in invertebrate immunology have led to
a paradigm shift in our understanding of the ways in
which animals respond to immunological challenges.

Previously, it was assumed that invertebrate immune
response proteins were germ-line encoded and were
selected over evolutionary time scales for broad recognition of conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns

(PAMPs). This was originally based on the assumption
that immune diversification only occurred in jawed vertebrates through somatic recombination of the immunoglobulin
(Ig)
gene family
that
employed
recombination activating gene (RAG)-mediated rearrangements of gene segments. However, recent studies on
invertebrates, jawless vertebrates and higher plants have
suggested that diversification of immunological responses
may occur in all organisms through a variety of mechanisms. Lampreys and hagfish monoallelically express
somatically diversified variable lymphocyte receptors
(VLRs) that contain different numbers and sequences of
leucine rich repeats (LRRs) [1-3]. In shrimp, three classes
of penaeidins show significant population diversity and
have varying antimicrobial activities against fungi and
Gram-positive bacteria based on substitutions and deletions within the proline-rich and cysteine-rich regions [46]. The Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule
(DSCAM) gene in Drosophila has 95 exons which undergo
extensive mutually exclusive alternative mRNA splicing
[7]. A DSCAM homologue has also been identified in the
mosquito with 101 exons [8]. The DSCAM gene potentially produces ~18,000 or ~16,000 different transcripts in
Drosophila or Anopheles hemocytes, respectively, that
encode a diverse set of proteins putatively involved in
phagocytosis [8,9]. In the tunicate, Ciona intestinalis, and
in amphioxus, Branchiostoma floridae, IgV-region containing chitin-binding proteins (VCBP) are encoded by polymorphic gene families and may have gut associated
antimicrobial function [10-15]. The freshwater snail,
Biomphalaria glabrata, has 13 families of fibrinogenrelated protein (FREP) genes that are expressed in
response to infection with trematode parasites, and diversify through gene conversion and alternative splicing [1618]. Finally, plant disease resistance (R) genes encoding
proteins with LRR domains, which function in pathogen
detection, generate diversity through a variety of mechanisms including meiotic mispairing, gene duplication and
gene conversion [19-21]. The immune response of the
purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, is likely
mediated, in part, by a number of large gene families [22].
These include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NACHT-domain
containing NOD-like receptors (NLRs) [23-25] and scavenger receptor cysteine-rich repeat-containing proteins
(SRCRs) [26] that have undergone expansion and diversification in the genome of this species [22]. Thus, a wide
variety of organisms are able to generate a diverse
immune response using a variety of molecular mechanisms [27,28].
In addition to the large gene families in the S. purpuratus
genome mentioned above, a highly variable family of
transcripts has been identified called 185/333, which
shows striking increases in response to bacteria and LPS
[29,30]. Optimal alignment of the 185/333 sequences

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/16

requires the insertion of large gaps that define 25 blocks
of sequence called elements [31]. Different subsets of elements are present in the mRNAs that are encoded by a single exon and do not result from alternative splicing.
Elements range in size from 15 to 357 nucleotides and
show sequence diversity based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertions/deletions
(indels). cDNAs that share the same set of elements (i.e.,
have identical element patterns) have been used to categorize sets of cDNAs. Based on the nucleotide diversity in
each of the elements, sets of cDNAs are likely to be composed of members with unique nucleotide sequences.
Analysis of 81 full-length cDNAs identified significant variability based on the element pattern and sequence diversity, in addition to the position and number of several
different tandem and interspersed repeats [31]. Message
variations were used to define 22 different element patterns, and the nucleotide diversity resulted in 67 unique
mRNAs that encoded 64 different proteins. One of the 81
cDNAs had a frame shift that resulted in missense
sequence and an early stop codon. The unexpected diversity of the 185/333 mRNAs, which are expressed in
response to immune challenge, has made them an intriguing gene family for understanding innate immune diversity in an invertebrate.
The 185/333 messages were originally identified from a
cDNA library constructed from coelomocyte mRNA
pooled from five sea urchins responding to a large dose of
a mixture of whole marine bacteria [26,29,32,33]. In the
current study, we have simplified this approach by analyzing coelomocyte mRNA from individual animals challenged with single PAMPs – either lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), β-1,3-glucan (Laminarin; Lam), or double stranded
RNA (dsRNA) – to identify differences in the 185/333
mRNA repertoire in response to different immunological
challenges. We report that animals injected with LPS and
Lam express messages with different element patterns
before vs. after immune challenge, whereas a similar
result was not identified for the dsRNA challenge. The
sequence diversity of the transcripts decreased in response
to LPS, suggesting that a specific subset of genes may be
expressed in response to this molecular pattern. On the
other hand, sequence diversity increased in response to
dsRNA even though the major element pattern did not
change, possibly suggesting that a greater number of genes
with the same element pattern are expressed. The diversity
of the response suggested that the innate immune system
of the purple sea urchin may have evolved to detect and
respond efficiently to microbial challenge with an array of
185/333 proteins.

Results
185/333 Expression
The outbred sea urchins used in this study were injected
with three different PAMPs and coelomocyte mRNA was
analyzed for 185/333 expression before challenge and at
various times after challenge. Messages were amplified by
RT-PCR using primers that annealed to the 5' and 3' UTRs
(see Methods). Sea urchins that did not respond to the initial injection, as measured by expression of Sp056, a Ctype lectin called SpEchinoidin [34-36], received a second
injection. In total, nine animals were used in this study
and eight were challenged with a single PAMP. To compensate for the large variations in the genetic make-up of
individual sea urchins [37,38], which may be reflected in
variations in the immune response, animal 2 was injected
with LPS, Lam and dsRNA, in separate experiments. For
clarity, this animal has been identified as 2-LPS, 2-Lam or
2-dsRNA.
185/333 transcript sizes match cDNA insert sizes
The range of expressed sizes of the 185/333 messages varied among animals and was influenced by immune challenge (Figure 1). The amplified messages ranged in size
from 0.16 kb to 1.5 kb, which was generally consistent
with previous results [31]. Amplicons were cloned from
nine animals for both pre and post challenge and 608
cDNAs were fully sequenced. From this set of cDNAs, 23
different element patterns were identified (Figure 2) of
which nine had been reported previously [31]. The major
band size observed for all animals on RT-PCR gels was
approximately 0.96 kb (Figure 1), which corresponded in
size to the major element patterns, E2 and E2.1 through
E2.6 (511 clones; Figure 2), which were 960 nucleotides
(nt) in length (Tables 1, 2). A second major band
observed on gels was 1.2 kb (Figure 1), which corresponded in size with four types of element patterns: C1
and C1.1 through C1.4 (38 clones), C2.1 (1 clone), D1
and D1.2 (36 clones), and D2 (2 clones) (Figure 2; Table
1). The largest amplified fragment observed prior to challenge was approximately 1.5 kb (Figure 1) and corresponded in size with patterns A6 and G1 (1 clone each).
The 0.85 kb amplicon corresponded with two element
patterns,01 (17 clones) and E6.1 (2 clones). Thus, the
observed major band sizes on gels corresponded to the
major element patterns determined by sequencing the
clones.

Patterns 05 and 06, isolated from animal 2-dsRNA, were
much shorter than the other clones from both this study
and from previous work [31]. Pattern 06 (79 nt, 2 clones)
only had a 5' UTR and element 25b with no other elements (Figure 2 and Additional File 1, see clone 2–2423).
Pattern 05 (161 nt, 3 clones) had a 5'UTR followed by the
leader and elements 1 and 2. The remainder of the elements were missing and no stop codon was identified

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/16

(Figure 2). Pattern 05 was similar in size to the 0.2 kb fragment amplified by RT-PCR from animal 2-dsRNA (Figure
1C). Pattern 04 had a 5'UTR and leader followed by element 1 and part of element 25 (Figure 2). It was cloned
from animal 4, although a fragment of 0.2 kb was not
observed on the gel (Figure 1D).
LPS challenge
All animals injected with LPS (1, 2, and 3) showed similar
expression patterns and changes in expression over time
(Figure 1A). A C-type lectin called Sp056 was used to
assess levels of immune activation [34-36]. It was
expressed by animal 1 prior to challenge and increased
expression by 24 hours (h) after challenge, whereas animal 2-LPS and animal 3 expressed Sp056 only after challenge. This indicated that these animals were either
immunoquiescent (no expression of Sp056) or down-regulated (very low expression of Sp056) at the start of the
experiment and that immune challenge with LPS activated
their immune response. Prior to challenge, animal 1
expressed 185/333 transcripts ranging in size from 0.96 kb
to 1.5 kb, and after challenge began to express a predominant 0.96 kb fragment at 3 h that became the only discernable band by 24 h. Sequence analysis showed that the
most common element pattern identified prior to challenge for animal 1 was E2.1 (11 of 15 clones; Table 1, Figure 2). After injection with LPS, 185/333 expression
changed such that E2.1 expression diminished and the
predominant element pattern was E2 (28 of 31 clones).
For a description of mRNAs with early stop codons (i.e.,
element pattern E2.1), see early stop codons below.

Animal 2-LPS expressed three message sizes prior to challenge but by 24 h after the first challenge, only two predominant message sizes were observed (Figure 1A). The
27 h sample from animal 2-LPS did not show any 185/333
fragments, although Sp056 expression was detected (data
not shown). By 48 h, 24 h after the second challenge, the
0.96 kb fragment was present. The only pre-challenge element pattern identified from animal 2-LPS was C1 (10
clones), which was not found among the post-challenge
clones (Table 1, Figure 2). After injection, an assortment
of element patterns was identified from 12 clones.
Although animal 3 expressed four 185/333 sizes both
before and after challenge with LPS, the major band size
changed from 1.5 kb to 0.96 kb (Figure 1A). The set of
clones collected prior to challenge was composed of six
distinct element patterns, with the major pattern being C1
(12 of 18 clones). Seven different element patterns were
isolated from animal 3 after injection (Table 1; Figure 2).
Similar to animal 1, E2 (8 of 18 clones) was the predominant pattern expressed post-challenge (Table 1; Figure 2).

Element2
Figure patterns identified from sequences of the 185/333 amplicons
Element patterns identified from sequences of the 185/333 amplicons. The element patterns (defined in [31]) for all
of the clones isolated from this study are represented in graphical form. Different elements are shown as differently colored
circles and ovals. Gaps are shown as horizontal lines. Short vertical black lines indicate the position of a stop codon and cDNAs
with an early stop codon are designated by a decimal point followed by an integer. Elements with a diamond indicate the locations of indels that lead to a frame shift and missense amino acid sequence (elements with horizontal stripes). The sequences
located 3' of the stop codon are shown to indicate that the remainder of the transcript sequence is present even though it may
not be translated (vertical stripes). The frequency with which each pattern was identified (#) and the antigen that induced the
pattern (Antigen) are indicated; L: LPS; β: Lam; R: dsRNA; a: aCF; *: whole bacterial challenge as identified in [31].

-, pre challenge; +, post challenge

Analysis of 104 clones isolated from three animals challenged with LPS revealed that patterns C1 (22 clones) and
E2.1 (11 clones) represented the majority of transcript
types isolated prior to challenge (33 of 104 clones). In
contrast, of the 61 clones analyzed from the 24 h sample,
the predominant patterns were E2 (41 clones) or E3 (4
clones; Table 1; Figure 2). However, among the more rare
element patterns (those isolated fewer than four times),
there were differences in the types and numbers of patterns present among the three animals that had received
LPS.

β-1,3-glucan challenge
The three animals (2, 6, and 7) injected with β-1,3-glucan
(laminarin; Lam) expressed similarly sized 185/333 messages prior to and after challenge (Figure 1B). Animal 2Lam did not show expression of either Sp056 or 185/333
prior to or at 3 h after challenge. However, by 24 h, Sp056
transcription was detected in addition to two sizes of 185/
333 messages, the most prominent of which was 0.96 kb.
Prior to injection, the major element patterns were E2 (6
of 15 clones) and E2.1 (8 of 15 clones). After injection,
however, the E2 pattern (33 of 36 clones) was the principal pattern identified (Table 1; Figure 2).

# Modeled alignments have been used to understand diversity scores. A diversity score of 0.0954 represents an alignment in which 10% of the
sequences have variations at 30% of nucleotide positions. A score of 0.0197 indicates that 1% of the sequences have a single change in 30% of the
nucleotide positions [29].
+ Diversity scores were not determined because fewer than three unique sequences were identified. However, sequences were included for
calculating total diversity scores.

Neither 185/333 nor Sp056 were expressed by animal 6
either prior to challenge or at 24 h. Consequently, a second injection of Lam was given 3 days (d) after the initial
injection, and gene expression was measured on d 4. A
single 185/333 fragment (0.96 kb) was observed in addition to Sp056 expression on d 4 (Figure 1B). Because animal 6 did not express detectable 185/333 transcripts prior
to injection, the only sample used for sequencing was
after the second injection (4 d). Of the 42 clones characterized, seven different patterns were identified (Table 1;
Figure 2) of which the principal element pattern was E2
(33 clones).

Animal 7 expressed three sizes of 185/333 messages, the
predominant being 0.96 kb, which was present both
before and after challenge with Lam (Figure 1B). Lack of
Sp056 expression indicated that the immune response of
animal 7 was immunoquiescent prior to injection and at
3 h, but was activated by 24 h. Of the 91 clones that were
sequenced from animal 7, E2.1 was the most common
pattern both before (40 of 47 clones) and after challenge
(37 of 44) (Table 2; Figure 2)
In general, animals challenged with Lam expressed a 0.96
kb fragment 24 h after injection, which was similar to the

response observed for animals challenged with LPS. Two
of the three sea urchins challenged with Lam expressed a
diverse set of 185/333 transcripts including messages with
rarely observed pattern types (Table 1). The predominant
post challenge pattern was E2 for animal 2-Lam and animal 6, which was consistent with the response to LPS, and
consistent with responses to injury (injections of artificial
coelomic fluid [aCF], discussed below). This was in contrast to animal 7, which did not alter 185/333 expression
in response to Lam, but continued to express E2.1 despite
changes in Sp056 expression that indicated that the
immune response had been activated.
dsRNA challenge
All three animals (2, 8, and 9) challenged with dsRNA
expressed similarly sized 185/333 transcripts (Figure 1C).
Prior to injection, all expressed the major 0.96 kb band,
even though the absence of Sp056 expression suggested
that all animals were immunoquiescent. Expression of
Sp056 in these animals increased in response to challenge,
indicating immune activation. After challenge, all three
animals continued to express the 0.96 kb fragment, while
animal 2-dsRNA and animal 9 expressed additional larger
(>0.96 kb) transcripts. At 24 h, animal 2-dsRNA expressed
an additional ~0.2 kb band, the only time a message of
this size was observed on gels.

Most of the clones isolated and sequenced from animal 2dsRNA both before (21 of 32 clones) and after (19 of 44
clones) challenge with dsRNA were the E2.1 pattern,
although the E2 pattern was also isolated after challenge
(12 of 44 clones) (Table 1). Similarly, animal 8 expressed
the E2.1 pattern both before (44 of 46 clones) and after
(28 of 41 clones) challenge. Only four 185/333 message
patterns were obtained from animal 9, of which all were
identified in animal 8 and/or animal 2-dsRNA. The major
pattern expressed by animal 9 was E2.1 both before (30 of
43 clones) and after (29 of 40 clones) challenge. Among
the three animals analyzed, the sizes (Figure 1C) and element patterns (Table 2) of the 185/333 transcripts
appeared to be unaffected by dsRNA challenge, which was
the only PAMP that did not induce obvious changes in the
element patterns for the 185/333 messages.
Response to Injury
Because each PAMP was suspended in aCF, injections of
aCF into two animals (animals 4 and 5) served as injury
controls (Figure 1D). Animal 4 expressed a multitude of
transcripts ranging in size from 0.96 kb to 1.5 kb before
injury and at 3 h after injection. However, by 24 h, only
the 0.96 kb fragment was observed. Expression of Sp056
was only observed at 24 h, indicating that animal 4 was
immunoquiescent prior to injury. Sequences of clones
from animal 4 before injury yielded three different element patterns with E2.1 as the major pattern (5 of 7

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/16

clones; Table 1). After injury, 14 element patterns were
identified (Table 1), the majority of which were E2 (19 of
43 clones).
Animal 5 expressed three message sizes prior to injury and
at 1 h after injection of aCF (Figure 1D). At 24 h post
injury, Sp056 expression remained undetectable, suggesting that the immune response had not been activated.
Therefore, a second injection of aCF was given at 24 h, and
by 48 h (24 h after a second injection of aCF), expression
of Sp056 indicated that the animal had activated its
immune system. The 0.96 kb 185/333 transcript was first
observed at 3 h and remained until 48 h post injury,
becoming the predominant transcript at 24 h. The major
element pattern expressed in animal 5 prior to injury was
C1 (9 of 10 clones). After injection of aCF, six different
element patterns were identified from 14 clones with D1
(5 clones) and E2 (5 clones) as the most common patterns. Overall, the animals responding to injury predominantly expressed element patterns C1 and/or E2.1 prior to
injury and E2 after injury, although there were differences
in the minor patterns expressed in each animal.
Animal 2
Analysis of 185/333 expression in a single sea urchin challenged with different PAMPs over time was valuable due
to the 4.5% difference among genomes of individual sea
urchins [37,38]. We have assumed that this level of
genetic variation among individuals would create differences in immune responses and make comparisons difficult. Therefore, we followed a single individual through
the experimental protocol to eliminate the possibility that
the observed differences in 185/333 expression were the
result of individual variations rather than differential
responses to the PAMPs. Animal 2 received separate injections of LPS, Lam, and dsRNA in that order during the
study. The animal was rested for 17 months after the LPS
challenge and 15 months after challenge with Lam and
the entire experiment required over 4 years to complete,
including 17 months that the animal was housed in our
aquaria without manipulation before the initial injection
of LPS. Because the life span estimate for S. purpuratus is
about 50 years [38], an increase in age by four years for
animal 2 was not expected to have an impact on immune
responsiveness. The level of immune activation for animal
2 was monitored by the expression of Sp056 before and
after each challenge. Sp056 was not expressed prior to
challenge with LPS and Lam, indicating immunoquiescence, but was expressed at low levels prior to dsRNA challenge, suggesting only down-regulation of the immune
response (Figure 1). Animal 2 expressed a set of 185/333
transcripts with a variety of element patterns in response
to LPS, Lam and dsRNA. Prior to challenge with LPS, C1
was the only pattern identified (10 of 10 clones), whereas
after challenge, E2 was the most common pattern (5 of 12

Page 8 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Molecular Biology 2007, 8:16

clones; Table 1). Upon return to immunoquiescence and
prior to Lam challenge, animal 2 expressed both E2 and
E2.1 (6 and 8 respectively of 15 clones). Following challenge with Lam, the animal again predominantly
expressed E2 (33 of 36 clones). However, both before and
after challenge with dsRNA, animal 2 primarily expressed
element pattern E2.1 (21 of 32 clones pre-injection; 19 of
44 clones post-injection). Although the lack of Sp056
expression or its low expression prior to each of the three
challenges suggested that animal 2 had returned to immunoquiescence, the animal expressed different 185/333 patterns before each challenge, which may suggest that it had
retained a low response level to the previous challenge.
Given that animal 2 did not appear to have responded to
dsRNA by changing the expressed 185/333 element patterns, it is noteworthy that it switched from expressing
pattern E2.1 to pattern E2 in response to LPS and Lam.
Not only did animal 2 exhibit variation in the 185/333
responses to challenges, but also showed variations in the
expressed element patterns between challenges.
Sequence Diversity
In addition to the variety of element patterns present in
the 185/333 mRNAs, significant nucleotide sequence
diversity was observed that resulted in different deduced
amino acid sequences in the encoded proteins (see Additional file 1). The mRNA diversity was analyzed in two
ways: 1) ratios of nonsynonymous vs. synonymous (dn/
ds) nucleotide substitutions, and 2) entropy-based
sequence diversity scores [31]. Dn/ds ratios of greater than
1.0 indicate that genes are under selective pressure for
diversification [39]. Diversity scores are based on the frequency of different nucleotides present at each position
within a given alignment and are influenced by any nucleotide change, regardless of whether or not that change
alters the protein sequence [40].
Nonsynonymous/synonymous ratios
Dn/ds values were obtained from individual sea urchins
for sets of cDNAs (transcripts with unique nucleotide
sequences but with the same element pattern) that had
three or more members (Table 2). The C1 element pattern
from animal 2-LPS prior to challenge had a dn/ds ratio
greater than 1, as did the E2 pattern from animal 2 after
Lam challenge. For the two animals that served as the
injury controls, element pattern C1 in animal 5 prior to
challenge and pattern E2 in animal 4 after challenge also
had elevated dn/ds ratios.

The dn/ds scores for 185/333 sequences had been calculated previously from cDNAs obtained from a library
derived from coelomocytes pooled from five sea urchins
[31]. In comparing the dn/ds scores of 185/333 sequences
from individual animals, we found that they were lower
than those from pooled mRNA. This difference may be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/16

due either to the genetic variation among animals [37] or
to different complexities of immunogens that were used
to challenge the animals. To test this, the dn/ds ratios were
calculated for all E2 sequences isolated in this study (205
clones encoding 109 unique sequences obtained from
nine animals) and were compared to the dn/ds ratio
reported previously for E2 (24 clones with 15 unique
sequences) from five animals used to construct the cDNA
library [31]. Notably, the dn/ds ratio for the nine animals
in this study was 0.7205, whereas that for the previous
dataset was 1.267. The difference between these results
was unlikely due to differences in methods used to generate the clones (clones from a conventional library vs.
cloned RT-PCR amplicons, see methods). It was more
likely that the set of 185/333 messages expressed by five
animals responding to a complex mixture of marine bacteria [31] was more diverse than the messages expressed
by nine animals responding to specific PAMPs.
Element diversity
In an effort to characterize the diversity among the elements and to identify possible hypervariable regions,
diversity scores were calculated for specific elements
before and after challenge. The diversity score of element
1 increased more than three fold after challenge with LPS
and Lam, but did not change in response to dsRNA or
injury (data not shown). Sequence diversity in the
remaining elements expressed in response to LPS, Lam,
dsRNA, or injury did not show discernable changes compared to pre-challenge diversity. Similar results were
obtained from an analysis of elements in messages from
animal 2 responding to all three PAMPs (data not shown).
Therefore, despite changes in expressed element patterns
in response to challenge, the sequence diversity of individual elements did not change (with the exception of element 1). Furthermore, the 185/333 sequences from
individual sea urchins did not reveal elements or regions
that were hypervariable, which was in agreement with the
previous report [31].
Diversity of cDNA sets
Diversity scores were also calculated for sets of cDNAs
(Table 2). For all animals in which E2 and E2.1 were
expressed, diversity scores for E2 consistently increased
after challenge, whereas changes in E2.1 diversity scores
were variable (Table 2). When cDNA sets from individuals
were combined for both pre- and post-challenge, diversity
scored tended to be higher than when pre- and post-challenge sets were calculated independently (Table 2; columns labeled total). Although there were some exceptions
to this result, it suggested that, although the same patterns
were present both before and after challenge, different
sequence variants of messages with the same element patterns were expressed at different times during an immune
challenge.

Page 9 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Molecular Biology 2007, 8:16

Diversity scores were also calculated for sequences collected from all animals responding to the same PAMP
(Table 2; last 3 columns). Comparisons showed that
scores increased in response to Lam and dsRNA. On the
other hand, scores decreased for animals injected with
LPS, and scores for the injury controls remained about the
same. This indicated that a set of 185/333 messages with
increased diversity was expressed in response to Lam and
dsRNA, whereas LPS and injury did not induce a similar
response.

tioned 5' of element 25 (i.e., E2.1, E2.2, etc; see Figure 2).
Four of the patterns with an early stop codon (E2.1, E2.6,
E2.5, and 01.3; Figure 2 and Additional file 2) had a SNP
that changed a translated codon to a stop codon. The
remaining patterns had small indels which introduced
frame shifts (Figure 2, designated by a diamond in the element) that led to missense sequence and an early stop
codon. If translated, these variations in the mRNAs would
result in truncated proteins.

Discussion
Because the E2 pattern was the only message type
expressed by all animals, the diversity of this pattern type
was calculated and compared to the E2 diversity scores
from individuals. When all E2 sequences were analyzed,
the diversity score was 0.0154, which was equal to or
greater than the diversity scores obtained from each of the
E2 sets from individual animals (Table 1). This suggested
that although all animals expressed E2, the nucleotide
diversity of this pattern was higher among the population
than within individuals. However, because the dn/ds
score for E2 was low, the variability in the nucleotide
sequence inferred from the diversity scores indicated that
the nucleotide changes did not have a greatly alter the
amino acid sequence. Overall, diversity scores of cDNA
sets from individual animals were lower than scores for
sets of sequences from all nine animals. The implication
was that sea urchins share 185/333 genes that have common element patterns, but that the common patterns do
not share identical sequence.

Previous reports analyzed cDNAs from coelomocytes
pooled from five animals challenged with a mixture of
marine bacteria [30,32,33]. This led to the identification
of the 185/333 transcripts, a diverse family of messages
expressed in response to immune challenge [29,31]. The
current study presents a simplified approach for investigating the expression patterns of 185/333 genes by challenging individual animals with small amounts of single
PAMPs. The substantial diversity evident in the 185/333
sequences is illustrated by the identification of 23 different element patterns in this study (excluding variants with
early stop codons) plus 21 element patterns described previously [31]. From these two sources of cDNAs, nine element patterns are shared for a total of 35 different patterns
identified from 14 sea urchins. When the nucleotide
sequences were compared for these two data sets, 62% of
the messages were unique and the C1 element patterns
(13 of 42 clones) were shared between the sets [this study;
[31]].

Animal 2 injected with each PAMP
Diversity scores and dn/ds ratios of cDNAs collected from
animal 2 were compared among the three challenges
(Table 3). Element patterns E2 and E2.1 were expressed in
animal 2 both pre- and post-challenge and were
employed in an analysis of sequence variability. The dn/
ds ratios for E2 and E2.1 increased in response to challenge while diversity scores remained about the same.
This indicated that although the nucleotide diversity did
not change in response to immune challenge, the
sequence variation present after challenge (dn/ds ratios)
likely led to changes in the amino acid sequence.

Changes in Element Patterns
The sea urchins employed in this study expressed different
185/333 genes in response to various PAMPs. Changes in
the expression of messages with different element patterns
were identified by sequencing cDNA clones isolated from
nine animals. The general trend in 185/333 expression in
response to each PAMP indicated a shift from primarily
C1 and E2.1 expression in immunoquiescent coelomocytes to E2 as the predominant element pattern after challenge (Table 4). The shift from C1 to E2 was a significant
change in the message and the encoded protein, implying
a change in gene expression after immune challenge. The
shift from E2.1 to E2 was significant as well, because the
presence of a SNP that changed the position of the first
stop codon caused a major change in the putative translated protein. This trend was not observed for animals
responding to dsRNA, which maintained expression of
the E2.1 pattern after challenge. It has been noted previously that the 185/333 response to injury progresses more
slowly than responses to bacteria [30]. Unlike the
response to LPS and Lam, the animals responding to
injury tended to express patterns E2 and D1 patterns
(Table 4). Although there were differences in element patterns expressed in different animals, animal 2 demon-

Early stop codons
In addition to introducing changes in the deduced amino
acid sequence, sequence diversity also introduced frame
shifts and altered the positions of stop codons. Previous
analysis had established the locations of three possible
stop codons associated with element 25 [31]. Sequence
analysis showed that in addition to the stop codons in element 25, 50% of the cDNAs had an early stop in a different element. Of the eight general pattern types (A to 0,
Table 1; Figure 2) that were identified in this study, five (C
to F and 0; Table 1) had members with a stop codon posi-

strated that individual sea urchins most likely expressed
different patterns over time and in response to different
challenges.
In addition to the expression of major element patterns,
each animal expressed an array of mRNAs with rarely
observed element patterns that were generally not shared
among individuals. In response to immune challenge, the
number of different rare element patterns expressed in
individual sea urchins increased in seven of 10 animals
(animal 2 was used three times and animal 6 did not have
pre-injection data; see bottom of Table 1, Figure 2). The
number of rare element patterns increased in all groups of
animals responding to all PAMPs (Table 4) and 27 of 35
rare patterns were present only after challenge (including
rare patterns with altered stop codon positions, and
excluding all major patterns; E2, E2.1, C1, D1; Table 1).
The rare patterns constituted an interesting aspect of the
diversity in 185/333 expression after challenge. These
results suggested that there may be a suite of genes found
in all sea urchins that encode the most common or major
element patterns and that there may be a much larger
number of genes encoding rare or minor element patterns
that are present in low frequencies within the population.
185/333 Sequence Diversity
Extensive nucleotide diversity was present in the 185/333
cDNA sequences such that 60% of sequences were unique
(using leader through element 25, excluding flanking
sequence) and 50% of the cDNAs had a premature stop
codon. Many of the clones with early stop codons were
found only once, but others (E2.1, E2.3, E6.1, and 01.1;
Figure 2) were identified multiple times with identical element patterns and early stop codons in identical posi-

tions. One obvious source of the observed message
diversity would be sequence diversity within the 185/333
gene family. However, preliminary sequence analysis of
more than 180 unique 185/333 genes shows that, except
for one pseudogene with an unusual deletion, there were
no early stop codons or frame shifts within the two exons
(Buckley and Smith, unpublished). This implies that posttranscriptional processing of an unknown nature may be
altering mRNA sequences.
The deduced proteins have an N-terminal glycine-rich
region and a C-terminal histidine-rich region [29,31].
Messages with early stop codons would putatively encode
truncated 185/333 proteins that include only portions of
these two regions. The most common 185/333 patterns,
C1 and E2, had stop codons at expected positions in element 25 and encoded proteins with 382 and 292 amino
acids, respectively. However, E2.1 had an early stop in element 12 such that the E2.1 protein would only have 142
amino acids consisting of the glycine-rich region and
missing most of the C-terminal histidine-rich region.
Although the functionality of the proteins encoded by
these abbreviated transcripts is unknown, it is an intriguing possibility that the glycine-rich region of the 185/333
proteins may have functions that can be altered by the
absence of the histidine-rich region. Functional truncated
proteins are unusual, but some have been demonstrated
in other systems [41,42]. Preliminary analysis of 185/333
protein sizes indicates that not only do these proteins
appear to multimerize, but they reveal intermediate sizes
not predicted by a single full-length cDNA (Brockton et al,
unpublished data). Consequently, the transcripts with
early stop codons may be translated and perhaps some of
the truncated proteins have a role in 185/333 activity.

Gene Expression
Message diversity appeared to be influenced by both the
type of challenge and the individual responding to the
challenge. Previous work indicates that large doses of
marine bacteria induce the 185/333 response within 6 h
[33], while small doses of LPS and other PAMPs induce
response more slowly. Animals responding to LPS showed
decreases in sequence diversity after challenge in addition
to changes in element patterns. This may indicate that the
LPS-induced response selectively alters transcription to a
smaller set of 185/333 genes that would putatively encode
proteins that may have some association with LPS. On the
other hand, animals injected with dsRNA did not show a
change in the element patterns of the 185/333 messages
even though nucleotide sequence diversity of those messages increased after challenge. Consequently, it was difficult to determine whether sea urchins respond to viral
molecular signatures. Because nothing is known about sea
urchin-specific viruses, it is not clear whether polyGC is
recognized as a threat, and it is also not clear whether the
antiviral response involves 185/333 proteins. Recent studies in shrimp show that dsRNA of low complexity may not
induce responses to the same degree as highly complex
dsRNA [43]. Alternatively, the rate of the sea urchin
response to dsRNA may be slower than that observed for
LPS and Lam, and the lack of obvious changes in element
patterns may be the result of terminating the experiment
too early. The beginnings of responses to dsRNA may have
been present because both animal 2-dsRNA and animal 8
showed post-challenge increases in messages of the E2
pattern, and all of the animals showed elevated sequence
diversity.

The response to Lam was not striking. Two of the three
animals responding to Lam showed the switch to E2
expression after challenge, but there was only a small
increase in sequence diversity. β-1,3-glucan is isolated
from giant kelp, Laminaria, and because kelp is a favored
food of the purple sea urchin, this molecular pattern may
not be recognized as a strong immunogen. On the other
hand, the 185/333 proteins may not interact with fungal
immunogens. Injury did not induce a change in sequence
diversity of the messages, which was unlike responses to
PAMPs.
Changes in message prevalence are typically attributed to
changes in transcriptional activity of the genes or to
decreases in the rate of message degradation. Yet it is feasible that changes in the messages could also be the result
of changes in subpopulations of coelomocytes responding to immune challenge. Preliminary results indicate that
the 185/333 proteins are expressed in two subpopulations
of phagocytes, of which one increases in numbers in
response to LPS (Brockton et al., unpublished; Majeske
and Smith, unpublished). However, for a change in coelo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/16

mocyte populations to alter the types and prevalence of
specific 185/333 mRNA, there must be a restricted expression of 185/333 genes in specific coelomocytes. Restricted
gene expression has been noted for VLR genes in lamprey
lymphocytes [1,44], has been proposed as a theory for sea
urchin TLRs [22] (see below), and is theoretically feasible
for 185/333-positive coelomocytes. However, verification
of this notion will require analysis of 185/333 expression
in single coelomocytes.
Because the sequence diversity and element patterns
changed during the 185/333 response to different PAMPs
in individuals, this implies that sea urchins may have
mechanisms to differentiate between the foreign molecular patterns that may dictate the regulation of 185/333
gene expression. The purple sea urchin has a large family
of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that are expressed on coelomocytes [22,38]. Speculation on function of TLRs suggests
that they may be restricted in expression to a few per coelomocyte and that possible combinatorial interactions on
coelomocyte cell surfaces may result in diverse yet highly
specific pathogen recognition capabilities [28]. Although
the analysis of the 185/333 gene promoters is underway,
it is not currently known whether the TLR detection system is involved in the regulation of this gene family. However, the estimated size of the 185/333 gene family and the
diversity of the 185/333 response appears to fit with the
complexity of the TLR genes.
Large Gene Families
Immune systems typically have large gene families, as
exemplified by the Ig family, which includes the novel
immune-type receptor (NITR) genes in fish [45] and the
FREP genes in snails [16,18]. Often, immune genes are
closely linked, which is a locus structure that appears to
promote gene duplication and sequence diversification,
and is an organization that has been noted for FREP genes
[18]. Large families of linked genes in the sea urchin are
also putatively associated with immune function including TLRs and NLRs [22,28,38]. Many of the sea urchin TLR
genes are closely linked and show sequence diversity in
the LRR domains, a result that is reminiscent of LRR
domain diversity in the plant R genes, which are also
closely linked [19-21,46,47]. Similarly, the 185/333 genes
are present in the genome as a large family of very closely
linked genes ([31], Buckley and Smith, unpublished) and
this may promote sequence diversification for this family
as well. Although RAG homologues have been identified
in the sea urchin genome [22,48], it is not known whether
the echinoderm recombinases are involved in immune
diversification. Consequently, for organisms lacking
higher vertebrate mechanisms for somatic diversification
of immune genes, a number of alternative mechanisms
are expected to exist to maintain an edge in the arms race
with the pathogens.

Conclusion
There are several conclusions that can be drawn from the
data presented here. Changes in element patterns and
sequence diversity of the 185/333 mRNAs occurred in
response to immune challenge and the encoded proteins
may be directed towards specific PAMPs. However,
changes in element patterns did not always correlate with
changes in sequence diversity of mRNAs (Table 4). The
predominantly expressed element patterns changed in
response to LPS, Lam and injury, but not in response to
dsRNA. Sequence diversity increased for Lam and dsRNA,
decreased for LPS, and did not change in response to
injury. Although challenge with either Lam or dsRNA
caused an increase in nucleotide diversity, decreased
sequence diversity was observed after LPS challenge, possibly indicating transcription of a smaller set of genes. Due
to the minimal changes in element patterns following
challenge, it was possible that sea urchins may not have
recognized polyGC as pathogenic. Differential responses
to the PAMPs indicated that sea urchins could differentiate among the molecular patterns and mount different
responses to those challenges.
The striking diversity of the sequences among the small
sample of animals reported here and previously [31]
implies that the variety of the 185/333 sequences within
the population is large. There may be a core set of genes
that are shared among all purple sea urchins that are augmented by a large number of genes that are more rare in
the population. Preliminary work on the structure of the
185/333 gene locus suggests that the number and orientation of 185/333 genes may promote diversification as has
been shown for R genes in plants [46]. Future work in the
area of innate immune diversification is expected to reveal
a multitude of mechanisms to accomplish this end in a
variety of organisms.

Methods
Animals
This study followed previously published protocols for
generating and using immunoquiescent sea urchins
[36,49-51]. Sea urchins were maintained in marine
aquaria without manipulation for at least 17 months
prior to the current study.
Animal Challenge and Tissue Collection
Sea urchins were challenged with LPS in a manner similar
to that described previously and was based on the estimated volume of the coelomic fluid (CF) from each animal [36,49,51]. Sea urchins were injected with 2 μg of LPS
per 1 ml CF (n = 3 animals), or 4 μg of either laminarin
(Lam; n = 3 animals; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or
polyGC (dsRNA; n = 3 animals; Sigma Aldrich) per 1 ml
CF to simulate an infection with gram-negative bacteria,
fungi, or virus, respectively. Each antigen was suspended

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/16

in aCF (10 mM CaCl2, 14 mM KCl, 50 mM MgCl2, 398
mM NaCl, 1.7 mM Na2HCO3, 25 mM Na2SO4) and
injected through the peristomial membrane directly into
the coelomic cavity of the sea urchin. Samples of whole
coelomic fluid (wCF; fluid plus cells) were taken 15 min
before challenge and 24 h after challenge. Two animals
were used as injury controls and received injections of aCF
using the same timing and volumes as the PAMP challenges. Animal 2-LPS and animal 5 were injected a second
time at 24 h and samples were taken at 48 h. Animal 6
received a second injection of Lam at 3 days. Expression of
Sp056 (GenBank Acc. # AY336600) was were used to
assess immune activation [34,36]. Amplification of SpL8
(a homologue of ribosomal L8) and actin were used as
controls for gel loading and cDNA integrity (data not
shown). These controls indicated that the absence of
amplicons for 185/333 and Sp056 was due to expression
that was below the detection sensitivity of the gel imaging
system rather than a protocol failure.
Samples of wCF were collected into anti-coagulant buffer
(aCF with 50 mM imidazole pH 7.4, 30 mM EDTA), centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C and the pelleted
coelomocytes were lysed and stored in RNA later (Ambion
Diagnostics, Austin, TX). Total RNA was isolated using the
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) per the manufacturer. Total RNA samples were treated with DNase using
the DNA-free kit per the manufacturer (Ambion, Austin,
TX).
RT-PCR
Reverse transcription (RT) was performed on 1 μg of total
RNA as previously described [36]. A pair of primers
(5'UTR forward: TAG CAT CGG AGA GAC CT; 3'UTR
reverse: AAA TTC TAC ACC TCG GCG AC) specific for
185/333 were designed to anneal in the untranslated
regions (UTRs) of the known 185/333 transcripts and
amplified the entire coding region [29,31]. Expression of
Sp056 (GenBank Acc. # AY336600, [35]) was analyzed
with Sp056F (GCA CAG CCA GCA ACC AGC ACT ACA
AT) and Sp056R (ACG CCG ATG GGT TCT ACA GTG AAG
GT) primers, which amplified a 640 bp fragment of the
message. Amplification of different transcripts was always
done in separate reactions. Each PCR reaction of 20 μl had
1 μM forward primer, 1 μM reverse primer, 0.5 μM of each
deoxynucleotide, 2 mM MgCl2, 1× company supplied
buffer, 0.5 U of ExTaq polymerase (Takara Bio, Otsu,
Shiga, Japan), plus 1 μl of the RT reaction, which served as
the cDNA template. Reactions were performed with a
Mastercycler Gradient thermocycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using the following program: 94°C for 5
min, followed by 25 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 55°C (185/
333) or 68°C (Sp056) for 30 s, 72°C for 2 min with a final
hold at 4°C. Images of the agarose gels were obtained
with a DC120 digital camera (Eastman Kodak Co. New

(Eastman Kodak Co.).
Cloning and Sequencing
Cloning into pCR4-TOPO vector was performed with 1 μl
of the PCR reaction using the TOPO-TA Cloning kit for
Sequencing (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) per the manufacturer. The cDNA clones were grown overnight and plasmids were isolated using Wizard Plus SV Minipreps DNA
Isolation Kit (Invitrogen).

Plasmids were sequenced directly using universal T7 and
T3 primers with 2× to 9× coverage. Sequencing was completed using either the DTCS Quick Start Kit for Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton,
CA) and analyzed on a CEQ8000 DNA sequencer (Beckman Coulter) or plasmids were sent to SeqWright DNA
Technology Services (Houston, TX). Sequences have been
deposited in GenBank with accession numbers EF065719
through EF066327.
The fidelity of the Taq polymerase used in this study was
tested to ensure that sequence diversity observed was not
a byproduct of Taq-induced errors. One clone (Sp0228,
GenBank Acc. # DQ183174; see Table S1 in [31]) with an
insert of 1519 nt was amplified by PCR and re-cloned as
described above. Subclones (n = 24) were sequenced and
alignments were used to identify and quantify the number
of nucleotide errors. An error rate of 1/18,228 nt was calculated (2 errors in 36,456 bases {24 clones multiplied by
1,519 nt}), which equates to one Taq-induced error in
about 18 clones (608 cDNA clones yielded 602,635 nt).
Bioinformatics
Sequence alignments were performed with BioEdit [52].
WinClada ver. 1.00.08 [53] was used to identify identical
sequences from the nucleotide alignments. Neighborjoining phylogenetic trees were created in MEGA3 [54]
and employed in Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum
Likelihood (PAML) [55] using three dn/ds models (M1,
M2 and M20) to identify statistically significant non-synonymous and synonymous (dn/ds) ratios. Diversity
scores were acquired using an in-house Perl script implementing an entropy equation [40] as previously described
[31].
