Abstract
Background: The rTS gene (ENOSF1), first identified in Homo sapiens as a gene complementary
to the thymidylate synthase (TYMS) mRNA, is known to encode two protein isoforms, rTSα and
rTSβ. The rTSβ isoform appears to be an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of signaling
molecules involved in the down-regulation of thymidylate synthase, but the exact cellular functions
of rTS genes are largely unknown.
Results: Through comparative genomic sequence analysis, we predicted the existence of a novel
protein isoform, rTS, which has a 27 residue longer N-terminus by virtue of utilizing an alternative
start codon located upstream of the start codon in rTSβ. We observed that a similar extended Nterminus could be predicted in all rTS genes for which genomic sequences are available and the
extended regions are conserved from bacteria to human. Therefore, we reasoned that the protein
with the extended N-terminus might represent an ancestral form of the rTS protein. Sequence
analysis strongly predicts a mitochondrial signal sequence in the extended N-terminal of human
rTSγ, which is absent in rTSβ. We confirmed the existence of rTS in human mitochondria
experimentally by demonstrating the presence of both rTSγ and rTSβ proteins in mitochondria
isolated by subcellular fractionation. In addition, our comprehensive analysis of rTS orthologous
sequences reveals an unusual phylogenetic distribution of this gene, which suggests the occurrence
of one or more horizontal gene transfer events.
Conclusion: The presence of two rTS isoforms in mitochondria suggests that the rTS signaling
pathway may be active within mitochondria. Our report also presents an example of identifying
novel protein isoforms and for improving gene annotation through comparative genomic analysis.

Background
The rTS (ENOSF1) gene, a member of the enolase family,
was initially identified in Homo sapiens by the discovery of

an RNA with extensive complementarity to the mRNA for
the DNA biosynthetic enzyme thymidylate synthase[1,2].
The rTS gene was later shown to code for two proteins

(rTSα and rTSβ) through alternative RNA splicing [2,3].
The mRNA for rTSα is complementary to thymidylate synthase mRNA, while the mRNA for rTSβ is not [2,3]. The
rTSβ protein is the major protein product of the rTS gene
and its expression is associated with the down-regulation
of thymidylate synthase protein as cultured cells enter
growth arrest [2]. Expression of rTSβ correlates with the
production of small molecules that appear to mediate the
down-regulation of thymidylate synthase protein by a
novel intercellular signaling mechanism [2]. Overproduction of rTSβ occurs in some cells resistant to inhibitors of
thymidylate synthase or dihydrofolate reductase, indicating a role for the rTS gene in folate and nucleotide metabolism, as well as anticancer drug resistance [2-6].
While the specific function(s) of the rTS gene products are
currently under investigation, we now report a new rTS
protein isoform and its association with mitochondria.
The existence of this new isoform, rTSγ, was first predicted
using a computational comparative genomic sequence
analysis approach and was then verified experimentally.
This unexpected observation suggests that rTS may have
functions in addition to intercellular signaling.

Results
A conserved extended protein N-terminus can be deduced
from all available rTS genes
Comprehensive analysis of all available database
sequences revealed that rTS genes demonstrate an atypical
phylogenetic distribution. rTS exists only in a few groups
of eubacteria, two fungal lineages (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota), and most animal species from insects to mammals. Among bacterial rTS orthologous genes, several
were annotated with a longer N-terminus based on a start
codon located further upstream. These proteins include
NP_355739.1 (Agrobacterium tumefaciens str. C58),
NP_540624.1(Brucella melitensis 16M), NP_639408.1
(Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris str. ATCC 33913),
NP_669902.1 (Yersinia pestis KIM), NP_828458.1 (Streptomyces avermitilis MA-4680), CAD61030.1 (Arthrobacter
ilicis), and ZP_00227861.1 (Kineococcus radiotolerans
SRS30216), while many other proteins, including
NP_405150.1 (Yersinia pestis CO92), NP_437232.1
(Sinorhizobium meliloti), NP_533476.1 (Agrobacterium
tumefaciens str. C58), NP_744975.1 (Pseudomonas putida
KT2440), ZP_00213853.1 (Burkholderia cepacia R18194),
ZP_00281771.1
(Burkholderia
fungorum
LB400),
AAM39023.1 (Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri str. 306),
and YP_070105 (Yersinia pseudotuberculosis) were annotated with an N-terminus equivalent to that of human
rTSβ. Therefore, we determined whether an equivalent
extended N-terminus could be predicted in the human
rTS gene. Previously, all available human rTS genomic
sequences appeared to contain a sequence gap immediately upstream of the start codon of rTSβ, and the pub-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/125

lished 5'-end of the rTS mRNAs was originally determined
by RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends) analysis of
cloned sequences [2]. Thus, a longer N-terminal was not
predicted initially, and not expected based upon the existing experimental evidence. However, at the time we
started this analysis, one BAC clone, RP11-778P8
[AC021474.1], was found to contain the sequence covering an extended exon region as well as the rest of the gene,
although its sequence was in a status of unordered fragments. In addition, a GenBank entry for the human rTS
gene by Dolnick and Su [AF305057] contains the complete 5'-end upstream sequence. Analysis of this sequence
by GenScan [7] predicts a start codon upstream of the start
codon for rTSβ, yielding an extended N-terminal that is 27
amino acids longer than rTSβ (Fig. 1A). A sequence comparison between the extended human rTS protein region
and the bacterial rTS proteins possessing a longer N-terminus revealed a high level of sequence similarity in the
extended region. Therefore, we reasoned that a longer Nterminus may exist in all rTS orthologous genes, and this
was confirmed by the presence of a possible equivalent
extension of the N-terminus in all available rTS genomic
sequences (Fig. 1A–E). We named this potential new isoform rTSγ to distinguish it from rTSβ and rTSα. During our
preparation of this manuscript, NCBI released a new RefGene entry for human rTSβ [NM_202758 and
NP_059982.1]. This entry, dated Dec-20-2004, predicted
a different N-terminus and was subsequently replaced by
another entry [NM_017512 and NP_059982.2] on 02March-2005, which has a deduced protein product identical to that described in this report. While all available animal rTS genes, including those from human, three fish
species (fresh and salt water pufferfish and zebrafish), the
basal chordate, Ciona intestinalis, and the invertebrate
Anopheles gambiae, share the same intron/exon boundary
position at least for the first exon/intron junction (Fig.
1A&B), the fungal rTS genes seem to vary in gene structure
making them different from the animal genes, as well as
from each other (Fig. 1C&D).
In addition to the genomic sequences, EST sequences for
rTS genes containing sufficient 5'-end sequences were also
identified for a few more animal species, including cow,
rat, frog, multiple bony fish species, sea squirt, beetles and
mites. Multiple sequence alignment analysis revealed that
the extended N-termini of rTS genes are conserved from
bacteria to human (Fig. 2). Therefore, we believe that the
extended N-terminal region represents an ancestral form
of the rTS gene products.
The extended N-terminus contributes a mitochondrial
signal in human rTSγ protein
During our search for potential new motifs and/or functions contributed by the extended N-terminal region of
rTS, we found that this extended sequence was predicted

to contain a mitochondrial signal. As shown in Table 1, all
available programs predict a strong mitochondrial signal
for rTSγ, but not for rTSβ, suggesting that the mitochondrial signal is conferred by the extended N-terminal
sequence.

(including mitochondria and lysosomes) were prepared
from CCRF-CEM human cells, and their proteins were
resolved by electrophoresis and analyzed for rTS protein
expression (Fig. 3A). The results indicate that two rTS proteins with apparent molecular mass of 52.7 ± 1.8 and 47.6
± 0.7 kDa (approximately corresponding to the difference
in the predicted molecular mass of the rTSβ and γ isoforms, respectively) are present. There was a preferential
distribution of the higher molecular mass species in the
organellar fraction as compared to the cytosolic fraction.
The presence in the organellar fraction of both lysosomal
(LAMP-1) and mitochondrial (MnSOD) marker proteins,
however, did not allow us to conclude that rTS proteins
are present in the mitochondria, rather than in the lysosomes. To resolve this, we partially separated lysosomes
from mitochondria using a 5–20% iodixanol gradient
[8,9](Fig. 3B). The protein profile of the iodixanol gradient shows a peak centered on fractions 14–15 with a pronounced shoulder in fractions 10–12. GDH activity
appears in fractions 12–18 with a peak at fraction 15, indicating the presence of mitochondria in these fractions.
The shoulder in the protein profile (fractions 10–12) that
lacks GDH activity suggests the presence of non-mitochondrial organelles, including lysosomes. This suggestion was confirmed by Western blotting of the gradient
fractions for MnSOD and LAMP-1 markers (Fig. 3C).
Analysis of the distribution of rTSβ in the gradient indicates that both the rTSβ and γ species co-localize with
MnSOD, but not LAMP-1, conclusively demonstrating
their presence in mitochondria, but not lysosomes.

Discussion
Functional implications for the rTS gene based on its
mitochondrial location
It has recently been determined that rTSβ is an enzyme
responsible for the synthesis of small signaling molecules
involved with the down-regulation of thymidylate synthase as cells enter growth arrest in vitro [6]. The signaling
associated with rTSβ was also shown to act intercellularly
[6]. Sequence analysis of the rTS gene suggested the presence of a mitochondrial leader sequence that would be
expected to increase the length of rTSβ from 416 to 443
amino acids in rTSγ with an expected change in molecular
mass from 46,892 to 49,742 Da. Based upon the predic-

tion of a mitochondrial leader sequence, we evaluated
whether there is a mitochondrial form of the rTS protein.
The results shown in Fig. 3 indicate that this is the case,
with two species being present in the mitochondria. These
two protein species have apparent molecular masses of
52.7 ± 1.8 and 47.6 ± 0.7 kDa. The smaller species corresponds well to the predicted size expected for rTSβ with
the mitochondrial leader sequence cleaved off, while the
larger species differs by 3 kDa from the predicted molecular mass for the isoform with the leader sequence. The
amounts of rTSγ and rTSβ in the combined cytoplasmic
and mitochondrial fractions differ from that expected to
result from combining equal amounts of each fraction.
The increased abundance of rTSβ, relative to rTSγ in the
combined fraction may be the result of in situ cleavage of
the rTSγ mitochondrial leader sequence by cytosolic proteases, which has been observed to occur in yeast cytosol
[10], although transfer of protein may also contribute to
the change in signal strength as the MnSOD signal is
weaker in the lane with the combined fractions than in the
lane loaded with just the organelle protein. Although the
migration of proteins in SDS-PAGE gives only approximate estimation of molecular masses, there is a possibility
that other post-translational modifications may contribute to this discrepancy. The co-localization of rTSβ and
rTSγ with GDH and MnSOD after subcellular fractionation strongly suggests that the extended N-terminal
sequence serves as the leader sequence for mitochondrial
location of the protein and that it is likely this is partially
cleaved to generate the β isoform, once rTSγ is transported
into the mitochondria. The presence of the rTSβ protein in
mitochondria raises the question of what role this enzyme
and the rTS signaling pathway may play there. Mitochondria are a major site for folate metabolism in mammalian
cells [11]. Thymidylate synthase is also found within
mitochondria [12], despite the absence of a canonical
mitochondrial leader sequence, and the relationship of
rTS signaling to thymidylate synthase and folate metabolism may ultimately provide the explanation for this phenomenon. Recent evidence indicates that treatment of
cells with an rTSβ signaling mimic can affect the cytoskeleton and cause down-regulation of TYMS [10,13]. The colocalization of rTS and thymidylate synthase in the mitochondria may indicate that rTSβ, in addition to its role in
intercellular signaling, also provides intracellular signals
that regulate thymidylate synthase levels in the
mitochondria.
Since the extended N-termini of rTS are conserved from
bacteria to human, we believe that the rTSγ form of the rTS
gene represents the ancestral form of this gene, while rTSβ,
which seems to be the predominantly expressed form in
the cytosol, represents an isoform that appeared later during evolution and came to co-exist with the ancestral isoform, at least in Homo sapiens. Based on a recent study

Unusual phylogenetic distribution of the rTS gene. The sequences of the same set of proteins displayed in Fig. 2 were
used to generate a neighbor-joining tree using ClustalX. The tree was displayed in TreeView program, while the taxonomic
labels of the species were added manually afterward. In addition to the extension of the N-terminus as indicated in Fig. 2,
adjustments to the currently annotated exon boundaries for a few rTS genes were necessarily made based on the best match
between their genomic sequences and the human rTSγ protein sequence (see detailed modifications in supplemental materials).
Bootstrap values that are over 700 (1000 trials) are shown at the nodes.

which shows that suboptimal AUG codons can support
translation via leaky scanning and reinitiation [14], the
co-existence of protein products translated using different
AUG codons in the same reading frame may not be a rare
phenomena. In fact, the starting AUG codons for rTSγ and
rTSβ are both qualified as optimal start codons according
to recent studies of translation initiation in mammalian
and plant genes [14-16], providing an explanation for the
co-existence of rTSγ and rTSβ. A recent study suggests that
many alternative splicing forms cause differential subcellular localization, especially in targeting either peroxisomes or mitochondria [17], and our data serves as

evidence supporting such a notion. An interesting subject
for future studies will be to determine when the shorter
rTSβ isoform appeared during evolution.
Phylogenetic distribution and origin of rTS gene
rTS is highly conserved, being found in a variety of species, ranging from bacteria to human. Unlike other enolase genes with a wider phylogenetic distribution, or the
thymidylate synthase (TYMS) gene, which is ubiquitous
in organisms from all three kingdoms and is highly conserved, rTS demonstrates an unusual phylogenetic distribution. As shown in Fig. 4, the presence of rTS is limited

to a few groups of eubacteria including α-, β-, and γ-proteobacteria, actinobacteria, some fungi, and animal species spanning the phylogenetic range from insects to
mammals. Among the vertebrate species for which draft
genome sequences and/or a large number of EST
sequences are available, we were able to identify rTS
sequences from all species with the exception of chicken
and mouse [see a complete list of deduced amino acid
sequences in Additional file 1]. Furthermore, we observed
in all vertebrate species with sufficient genome sequences
including human, chimpanzee, rat, and fugu fish, that the
TYMS-rTS gene pair is part of a large conserved gene synteny among vertebrates (data not shown). While the
absence of rTS sequence in chicken may be due to the
insufficiency of available genome sequences or ESTs, we
were puzzled by the failure to retrieve any rTS sequences
in mouse, considering the fact that the mouse genome
sequence is now fairly complete and its EST data is quite
comprehensive. However, we recently obtained preliminary data showing expression of mouse rTS protein and
mRNA (data not shown). Another unusual observation is
that the rTS gene does not seem to be present in E. coli
while the rTS gene is present in another enterobacterium,Yersinia pestis. Similarly, although the rTS gene is
present in Anopheles gambiae and several other insect species, but is not found in Drosophila. So far, no rTS gene has
been identified in any plant or yeast species despite the
fact that complete genome sequences and comprehensive
EST sequences are available for a number of species in
these lineages. We also find no rTS sequences from
Caenorhabditis elegans or other worm genome sequences.
The same is true for all archaebacteria and many eubacteria lineages. These observations suggest that the rTS gene
originated as a bacterial gene which was either horizontally transferred into certain animal and fungal lineages,
or alternatively, was lost in all the lineages that do not
contain rTS genes. An interesting observation is that,
while the rTS branches for the animal lineage and the fungal lineage show a topology that agrees well with commonly accepted tree of life for these species, the branches
for the bacterial lineages conflict with the commonly
accepted tree for the bacterial lineages (Fig. 4). The latter
is demonstrated by the fact that species from the same lineage do not always group together, while species from different bacterial lineages do cluster together in many cases
(Fig. 4). For example, one β-proteobactial rTS sequence
(rTS_bc) is grouped with α-proteobacterial sequences,
while the other two β-proteobacterial sequences cluster
with a γ-proteobacterial sequence and the three rTS
sequences from the High G+C gram positive bacteria are
located on three different branches, which all consist of
sequences from multiple groups (Fig. 4A). Although not
all nodes for the bacterial groups are supported by a high
bootstrap value, many nodes are supported with high
confidence. This type of unexpected phylotree shown by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/125

the rTS sequences suggests the possibility of horizontal
gene transfer among the bacteria species, which is common [19-21]. The fact that most of the bacteria and fungi
that have a rTS gene are human and/or animal pathogens
(Aspergillus nidulans, Brucella suis, Brucella melitensis, Burkholderia cepacia Burkholderia fungorum, Cryptococcus neoformans, Yersinia pestis, Silicibacter sp), plant pathogens
(Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Gibberella zeae, Xanthomonas
axonopodis, Xanthomonas campestris., Ustilago maydis, Magnaporthe grisea), or in one instance a plant symbiont (S.
meliloti), adds weight to the hypothesis of horizontal gene
transfer events. In the case of plant pathogens, the plants
can serve as a mediator between a bacterial donor and an
animal acceptor. This may also suggest that the rTS gene is
required to create and/or maintain a certain type of hostpathogen relationship. Therefore, a better understanding
of the biological function of the rTS gene may provide
new insights for disease control related to these bacterial
pathogens.
In addition to the discovery of this novel mitochondrial
isoform of rTS, our report also represents a good illustration of the use of comparative genomic analysis for identifying novel protein isoforms of genes and for improving
existing gene predictions. Through this study, we have
made a comprehensive collection of rTS orthologous
sequences and have made a list of suggested modifications to the existing gene annotation (see detailed modifications in the supplemental materials). In addition, by
searching all annotated human genes, we identified a few
other genes in which evolutionarily conserved alternative
upstream AUG codons exist (similar situation as rTSβ).
These genes include SELL [NM_000655], SPCS1
[NM_014041.1], NT5C3 [NM_016489], and SDN1
[NM_014390] (data not shown).

Conclusion
In summary, through comparative genomic analyses we
revealed an unusual phylogenetic distribution of the rTS
gene and identified a novel mitochondria isoform of this
gene and verified it experimentally. A mitochondrial
location of rTS protein and phylogenetic distribution of
this gene provide us with new information that will assist
in elucidating its function.

Methods
Identification of an extended N-terminal region for all
available rTS genes
To search for all available rTS orthologous sequences, we
first queried all protein sequences deposited in the NCBI
non-redundant protein database (nr) by BLAST search
[21]. Among all identified rTSβ orthologous protein
sequences, the ones with an N-terminus equivalent to
human rTSβ were identified and their corresponding
genomic sequences, including sufficient 5'-end upstream

sequences for analysis, were retrieved. Extended N-termini
were deduced by extending the start codon to the next
available "ATG" upstream of the start codon used by the
existing annotation. In addition to the rTS orthologous
genomic sequences, we also searched the NCBI EST database by performing a TBLASTN search with the extended
human rTSβ protein sequence to collect rTS cDNA
sequences from additional species. To predict any potential new function or cellular location contributed by the
extended N-terminus, we analyzed the human rTSγ and
rTSβ protein sequences with Mitoprot [22], TargetP [23],
PSORTII [24], and Mitopredict [25,26].
Subcellular fractionation of CCRF-CEM cells
The human T-lymphoblastic cell line CCRF-CEM was cultured as described [27]. Subcellular fractions of CCRFCEM cells were isolated essentially as described [28],
except that protease (0.5 mM Pefabloc) and phosphatase
inhibitors (1 mM sodium metavanadate and 1 mM NaF)
were included in all buffers. All steps were performed at 0
– 4°C. Briefly, 1-liter of CCRF-CEM cells (~3.5 × 105 cells/
ml) was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min and the pellet
was washed with iced 0.9% NaCl, and then suspended in
5 pellet volumes of ice-cold hypotonic buffer [30] and
allowed to swell for 5 min on ice. The suspension was
homogenized in an ice-cold 7-ml glass Dounce homogenizer with 15 strokes of the tight pestle to obtain > 95%
cell disruption. The homogenate was immediately made
up to 250 mM sucrose and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5
min. The pellet was washed once with 2.5 original pellet
volumes of cold isotonic buffer (1 mM Na2-EDTA, 250
mM sucrose; pH 6.9). The two supernatants were combined to generate the post-nuclear supernatant (PNS). The
PNS was centrifuged at 17,000 × g, 15 min to generate a
cytosolic fraction (supernatant) and an organellar pellet
containing both mitochondria and lysosomes. The
organellar pellet was suspended in 1 ml of HES (20 mM
HEPES-NaOH, 1 mM Na2-EDTA, 250 mM sucrose; pH
7.4). Subcellular fractions were assayed in duplicate for
activity of the cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) [30] and mitochondrial matrix enzyme glutamate
dehydrogenase (GDH) [31] to ensure that fractionation
was successful. To separate mitochondria and lysosomes,
this organellar suspension was made up to 30% (w/v)
iodixanol [8,32] in a final volume of 2.2 ml and placed on
a 5–20% linear iodixanol gradient (9 ml), centrifuged at
70,000 × g for 1.5 hr, and collected as 0.5-ml fractions,
which were then diluted with 0.5 ml ice-cold HES and
centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting
organelle pellets were suspended in 200 µl of isotonic
buffer (as above, except that NaF was 50 mM). Protein
concentration was determined using the BioRad (Hercules, CA) protein assay kit.

Western blotting
Proteins were resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis
using 10% polyacrylamide and transferred to PVDF membranes essentially as described [4]. The primary antibodies
used were: D3 (mouse monoclonal to rTSβ), LAMP-1
(mouse monoclonal to lysosome-associated membrane
protein-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and MnSOD (rabbit polyclonal to manganese superoxide dismutase; Stressgen). Secondary antibodies consisted of horseradish
peroxidase conjugated F(ab')2 fragments and were
obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories.
Probed blots were imaged using West Pico Dura chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce) and X-OMAT AR X-ray film
(Kodak). Pre-stained protein molecular weight markers
(BioRad) were included during electrophoresis to allow
determination of apparent molecular weights of detected
antigens. All experiments were repeated at least twice with
similar results.
