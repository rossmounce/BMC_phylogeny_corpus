Abstract
Background: Studies have suggested that demographic and lifestyle factors could shape the composition of fecal
microbiota in early life. This study evaluated infant stool microbiota signatures in two Asian populations, Singapore
(n = 42) and Indonesia (n = 32) with contrasting socioeconomic development, and examined the putative
influences of demographic factors on these human fecal associated bacterial signatures.
Results: Longitudinal analysis showed associations of geographical origin with Clostridium leptum, Atopobium and
Bifidobacterium groups. Mode of delivery had the largest effect on stool microbiota signatures influencing the
abundance of four bacterial groups. Significantly higher abundance of bacterial members belonging to the
Bacteroides-Prevotella, Bifidobacterium and Atopobium groups, but lower abundance of Lactobacilli-Enterococci group
members, were observed in vaginal delivered compared to caesarean delivered infants. Demographic factors
influencing the structure of infants stool microbiota during the first year of life included breastfeeding, age of
weaning, sibship size and exposure to antibiotics.
Conclusions: Differences in stool microbiota signatures were observed in relation to various demographic factors.
These features may confound studies relating to the association of the structure of fecal microbiota and the
predisposition to human modern disease.

Background
The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem
harbouring a rich diversity of commensal microorganisms. It is widely thought that the early life development
of the neonatal intestinal microbiota plays an important
role in the maturation of the host immune system and
could in turn influence allergy development [1-3]. For
example, germfree mice which lack the endemic intestinal microbiota showed impairment of intestinal mucosal and systemic immune system development. The
impairment in the systemic immune system is reflected
by poorly formed spleen and lymph nodes, hypoplastic
Peyer’s patches, reduced levels of secreted IgA and IgG,
and lack of expansion of CD4+ T cell populations [2,3].

Furthermore, these mice exhibited cytokine profiles that
skewed towards Th2 [2], which is involved in the pathophysiology of allergic diseases.
Past studies have further reported that intestinal
microbiota in subjects with allergy, particularly those
with atopic eczema, differed from those of healthy controls [4-7]. Wang and colleagues showed that there is a
reduced bacterial diversity in the early stool microbiota
of infants with atopic eczema [7]. Recently, we further
showed that the abundances of Bifidobacterium and
Enterobacteriaceae were different among caesareandelivered infants with and without eczema [5]. The association with specific gut microbiota signatures and the
occurrence of allergy in infants has also been reported
in studies comparing healthy and allergic infants from
different countries [8,9].
However, varying demographic and lifestyle characteristics at different geographical locations can pose as

potential confounders in correlating multidimensional
data generated from studies involving the diverse bacterial populations of the gut microbiota as “quantitative
traits”. For example, factors that have been shown to
influence gut microbiota colonization in early life
include the mode of delivery of the newborn, infant
feeding pattern, and household factors such as sibship
size [8,10-12]. Additionally, medication such as the use
of antibiotics may also influence the pattern of intestinal
microbiota colonization [10,11]. Across geographical
locations, socioeconomic and cultural differences would
result in a significant variance in the mothers’ choice of
dietary regimen for their infants, the number of children
born within a household (i.e., sibship size) and so on.
Therefore, prior to examining the correlation between
host health status and gut microbiota, it is essential to
better elucidate how the gut microbiota would be
affected by the various demographic and lifestyle factors
arising from living in different geographic locations.
Our study aimed to investigate the influence of demographic factors on determining the microbial colonization of the infant colon in two Asian populations,
Singapore (SG) and Yogyakarta, Indonesia (IN). SG
represents an affluent and urbanized community, and
IN being an urbanized but developing community. We
employed molecular techniques: terminal restriction
fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and fluorescent in situ hybridization combined with flow cytometry
(FISH-FC) targeting seven major bacterial groups to
evaluate and monitor the structure of the colonic microbiota at four time points (i.e, 3 days, one month, three
months and one year of age). This study would provide
insight on the infant gut microbial succession pattern,
as well as the demographic factors that influence stool
microbiota signatures in these two Asian populations
over the first year of life.

Results
Demographic and Clinical Characteristics

The demographic and clinical characteristics are shown
in both Singaporean (SG) and Indonesian (IN) populations (Table 1). Vaginal delivery was more common in
SG compared to IN (p = 0.019). In early infancy till 6
months, 85.7% and 80.7% of the SG and IN cohorts,
respectively, opted for partial breast and formula feeding. There were a higher percentage of Indonesian
infants who were exclusively breastfed in the first 6
months (18.72%, 6/32). In contrast, none of the Singaporean infants were exclusively breastfed for that period
of time (p = 0.004). Instead, more SG infants (14.3%)
were exclusively formula fed in the first 6 months compared to none in the IN cohort (p = 0.035). Weaning to
semisolids for IN cohort occurred later than SG cohort
(6.72 months versus 3 months, respectively; p = 0.022).

from the geographic locations were observed for factors
such as gender proportion, postnatal antibiotics consumption and sibling number.
Temporal change of relative abundance of seven
bacterial groups

The relative abundance of seven bacterial groups was
quantified (Figure 1). Although the proportions differed,
the trends of bacterial colonization studied over the first
year of life were similar for SG and IN cohorts (Figure
1). For example, in both SG and IN cohorts, members
of the Enterobacteriaceae family, were one of the earliest
colonizers and gradually decreased to an average 0.67%
of total bacteria counts at 1 year of age. Colonization of
Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium coccoides group
increased gradually from 0.18% to 24.07% of total

bacteria at 1 year old. The colonization pattern of Bifidobacterium showed an initial increase from a mean of
19.92% at 3 days to 49.50% at 3 months but later
decreased to 27.34% at one year of age. A reversal of
pattern was seen with Clostridium leptum group where
a decrease in colonization from a mean of 5.88% to
1.59% occurred between 3 days and 3 months of age but
increased subsequently at the age of one year. The other
three bacterial groups such as Bacteroides-Prevotella,
Atopobium and Lactobacilli-Enterococci group remained
in relatively lower abundance throughout the first year
of life, and each constituted less than 10% of the total
bacteria detected in stool sample throughout all time
points. The phylogenetic gap included the remaining
bacterial members that were not targeted by our panel
of probes, and the relative abundance of the phylogenetic gap ranged from 22.89% to 37.40% of total
bacteria.
Influence of Demographic and Lifestyle/Clinical
Characteristics

We comparatively examined the abundances of bacterial
groups in relation to demographic factors: geographical
origin, mode of delivery, dietary regimen and weaning
age, and sibship size. These demographic characteristics
differed between the SG and IN cohorts (Table 1), and
we aimed to determine if these demographic factors
would result in corresponding differences in the abundance of specific fecal associated bacterial groups. The
additional file 1 details the univariate analysis of relative
abundance (%) of seven bacterial group members of the

infant fecal microbiota in relation to geographical and
clinical factors.
(A) Geographical Origin

Three bacterial groups, namely Clostridium leptum, Atopobium and Bifidobacterium, differed in abundance
between the SG and IN cohorts. Linear mixed model
revealed that the relative abundances of Clostridium leptum [coefficient (B): 7.758, 95% confidence interval (CI):
5.063-10.453, adj p < 0.001] and Atopobium group [B:
3.526, 95%CI: 1.102 - 5.949, adj p = 0.005] were higher
in IN cohort (Figure 2). Conversely, lower relative abundance of Bifidobacterium was observed in the IN cohort
[B: -13.950, 95%CI: -26.423 - -1.476), adj p = 0.029]
(Figure 2).
(B) Mode of Delivery

Longitudinal analyses over four time points showed that
mode of delivery had the largest effect on the abundance of four bacterial groups (Figure 3). In vaginal
delivered infants, significantly higher abundance of Bacteroides-Prevotella [B: 3.016, 95%CI: 0.639 - 5.394, adj p
= 0.014], Bifidobacterium [B: 16.040, 95%CI: 5.667 26.414, adj p = 0.003] and Atopobium group [B: 2.531,
95%CI: 0.472 -4.589, adj p = 0.017] were observed.
However, lower abundance of Lactobacilli - Enterococci
group [B: -3.665, 95%CI: -5.949 - -1.381, adj p = 0.002]
was observed in vaginal delivered infants.
(C) Breastfeeding and Age of Weaning

The relative abundance of Lactobacilli-Enterococci
group was significantly higher in infants who were
exclusively breastfed throughout all time points [B:
5.236, 95%CI: 1.044 - 9.428, adj p = 0.015] (Table 2).

T-RFs of stool microbiota in SG and IN cohorts were
obtained from three individual enzymatic digestions (i.e.,
AluI, MspI and RsaI), and compared for their microbial
richness based on Shannon and Simpson Index. Microbial richness between the cohorts was considered different when both Shannon and Simpson Index from all
three enzymatic digestions were significantly different.
Table 3 shows that there were no observable differences
in the microbial richness of SG and IN cohorts at both
3 months and 12 months of age, both before and after
adjusting for demographic confounders. In contrast,
when the infants from both geographical locations were
grouped according to their mode of delivery, microbial
richness of stool microbiota in vaginal-delivered infants
had a significantly higher microbial richness compared
to caesarean-delivered infants at 12 months of age

not correlate with other lifestyle factors.

Discussion
In this study, we first examined the temporal succession
of specific bacterial groups in the infant stool microbiota
sampled from two geographical locations (i.e., Singapore
and Yogyakarta, Indonesia). These two populations in
Asia are considered diverse, in terms of geographical
distance, cultural ethnicity and overall social economic
development. Despite these differences between the two
populations, our findings showed that the dynamic of

colonization was similar in both cohorts. For example,
Enterobacteriaceae and Bifidobacterium constitute the
predominant bacterial groups in stool microbiota before
three months of age, and were present at a relative
abundance of up to 98% of total bacteria. This observation is in agreement with past reports which found that
healthy infants from Netherlands, breastfed Indian
infants from Guatemala, preterm infants from Nigeria
and 6-week old infants across Europe also had a similar
predominance of Enterobacteriaceae and Bifidobacterium [10,13-15]. As the infants age, our study also
showed that Firmicutes represented by members of the

Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium coccoides group
increased in its abundance, and gradually resembled that
of an adult stool microbiota i.e. mainly populated with
members of the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phylum
[16]. The similarities in the pattern of colonization from
early till late infancy despite geographical differences
may be related to multiple factors. For example, the prevalence of facultative anaerobes Enterobacteriaceae during early life may be due to a relatively aerobic
gastrointestinal tract, and the need for the facultative
anaerobes to deplete the oxygen content so as to provide an anoxic environment suitable for other commensal microbes to establish [17].
There remains no clear explanation for the predominance of Bifidobacterium in most infants, including
those who were exclusively formula-fed, but not in
adults. A possible reason may be related to the diet consumed by the human host at different stages of life. To
illustrate, dietary carbohydrates that are consumed by
infants comprise mainly disaccharides (lactose) and oligosaccharides [18,19], which are in turn rapidly hydrolyzed to form galactose and glucose monosaccharides
[20,21]. A portion of these monosaccharides becomes
available for the commensal microbiota, and because
Bifidobacterium spp. produce more ATP per mole of
glucose through the bifidus pathway [22], there remains
a selective advantage for Bifidobacterium to out compete
the other commensal bacterial groups fermenting carbohydrates through the conventional glycolysis and 6phosphogluconate pathways. Subsequently, as the host
matures and undergoes weaning, the dietary carbohydrates become more complex and eventually favour the
establishment of other bacterial members belonging to
the Bacteroides and Clostridium for instance, which are
known to contain a wide repertoire of polysaccharidesutilizing gene clusters that can effectively degrade complex dietary carbohydrates [23-25]. A recent study conducted in five European centres reported a decrease in
the abundance of Bifidobacterium, Enterobacteriaceae
and certain species of Clostridium, whereas the abundance of members belonging to the Clostridium coccoides and Clostridium leptum groups increased after
weaning [26]. Variations in dietary habits between Singapore and Indonesia may explain the differences in
rates of colonization of these bacterial groups between
Singapore and Indonesian subjects and therefore the
slopes of the curves with age for Bifidobacterium, Clostridium leptum and Bacteroides (Figure 2).
A low relative abundance of the Bacteroides-Prevotella
group was observed throughout all time points up till
the age of 12 month (mean 7.31%). Our previous publication based on 16S rRNA pyrosequencing reported
similar proportion of Bacteroides (8.90%) in healthy
infants at 12 months [5] and substantiates the findings

Page 6 of 10

in this current study. On the contrary in adult the Bacteroidetes co-inhabits with the Firmicutes and both
phyla dominate the bacterial community of the human
gut microbiome [16,27,28]. The structure of the infant
gut microbiome is dynamic and evolves over the first
years of life toward an adult-like microbiota [29-31].
Besides monitoring for the temporal succession of
stool microbiota, we further evaluate if demographic
and lifestyle differences in the two studied geographical
locations (Singapore, SG and Indonesia, IN) would influence the abundance of specific bacterial groups. A study
conducted across Europe showed that the geographic
origin had an impact on the composition of the gut
microbiota [10], and it remains unknown if the structure
of the microbiota is influenced to the same extent in
Asia. In this study, both SG and IN differ in its extent
of development and urbanization, and we observed a
higher relative abundance of Bifidobacterium in the SG
cohort compared to IN. This might be a common feature of urban populations, as it has also been reported
previously for Northern European countries such as
Stockholm to have a higher abundance of Bifidobacterium in infants stool microbiota as compared to those
sampled in the Spanish province of Granada [10].
In addition, the two geographical locations in this
study differ significantly in various aspects, for instance
in mode of delivery, feeding history, occurrence of antibiotics consumption and sibling number. Interestingly,
these factors studied have also been associated with the
development of allergic diseases [32-35]. It has been
postulated that the influence of these factors have on
atopic disease may at least be in part through the effects
on profile of gut microbiota. When we examined the
effects of demographic and lifestyle factors, we found
that the mode of delivery had the largest effect on stool
microbiota of infants. These observations are supported
by previous studies, where higher numbers of bacterial
members belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium
[36,37], Bacteroides and Atopobium group were
observed for vaginal delivered infants compared to caesarean delivered infants [8,10]. Compared to caesarean
delivered infants, the general notion is that infants who
are vaginally delivered are exposed to their mothers’
vaginal microbiota, in particular the Lactobacillus spp.
[38], and therefore would have a higher incidence of
bacterial transmission to their gut. However, in contrast
to previous report which detected a higher abundance
of Lactobacillus spp. in vaginally delivered infants [39],
we detected a lower abundance of Lactobacilli-Enterococci group in our studied cohort. This discrepancy may
be due to the specificities of different oligonucleotide
primers/probes used to target the Lactobacillus-Enterococci group. Alternatively, the close adherence of Lactobacillus spp. to mucosal layers might hinder its

Yap et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:193
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/193

transmission to the infants while the other vaginal
microbiota gets transmitted to the infant [40]. Future
validations on a larger cohort of vaginally delivered
infants residing in SG and IN will be needed to verify
the associated low abundance of Lactobacillus.
Our study also showed that vaginal delivered infants
had a significantly higher number of terminal restriction
fragments (T-RFs) and microbial richness at 12 months
of age. Previous studies had reported that the diversity
of stool microbiota increased over time [41]. We postulate that the higher abundance of beneficial bacteria
such as Bifidobacterium associated with vaginal delivery
may promote the diversity of overall gut microbiota as
the infant ages.
Our findings also suggest that antibiotics consumption
and sibling number are potential factors that influence
the bacterial composition of the human fecal microbiota.
For example, the consumption of postnatal antibiotic
exposure resulted in a higher relative abundance of
members of the Clostridium leptum group at one year
of age. Previous studies have also found that postnatal
antibiotic intake were associated with decreased numbers of Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides [11,42], further
suggesting that antibiotics consumption can perturb the
structure of the commensal microbiota. A higher abundance of Bifidobacterium was observed to be associated
with the presence of older siblings [11]. Furthermore,
we noted a corresponding decrease in the abundance of
Enterobacteriaceae with the number of siblings. Interestingly, Lewis and colleagues have previously reported a
decrease in the incidence of allergy with the number of
siblings [34], while our past studies have found higher
abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. and decreased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae in healthy infants compared
to infants with eczema [5,6]. It remains to be further
established if these multitude of factors: the sibship size
and abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. and Enterobacteriaceae are intricately linked with the development of
allergy and its related disorders. Besides demographic
and lifestyle characteristics, the genetic make-up of the
host has been proposed to be an important contributing
factor in shaping the composition of the gut microbiota.
Ambiguous findings were reported for twin studies on
the influence of host genetics on gut microbiota [27,43],
whereas absence, mutation or variation of certain single
host genes were shown to affect the composition of gut
microbiota [44].
FISH-FC approach showed a phylogenetic gap ranging
from 22.89% to 37.40% of total bacteria for the four
time points. A similar bacterial coverage was reported
by Fallani et al using the same method, where the sum
of bacterial cells detected were 72.7% ± 24.5% [10] and
74.3% ± 18.9% [45] with a panel of 10 non-overlapping
probes. We acknowledge that the molecular techniques

Page 7 of 10

applied in this study do not permit a thorough description of the bacterial population inhabiting the human
colon. Future studies would aim to utilize deep sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes so as to delve in depth the
bacterial communities populating the human microbiome [46,47]. Their greater depths of sampling offer
the opportunity to explore within the phylogenetic gap
and beyond, therefore allowing high-resolution association studies involving the bacterial populations of the
human microbiome as “quantitative traits”.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have shown that variations in term of
relative abundance in infant fecal microbiota are discernable for bacterial groups between two Asian populations of different geographical locations. The differences
in the stool microbiota were partly explained by certain
lifestyle and clinical factors. These features may confound studies relating to the association of stool microbiota and the predisposition to disease, and should be
an important confounder to take note for comparative
studies that enrol large population cohort across different geographical origins.
Methods
Subject recruitment and study design

The SG at risk of atopy cohort (n = 42) is a subgroup
selected from the placebo arm (n = 112) of a randomized double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial on
the administration of probiotics supplemented cow’s
milk-based infant formula for 6 months on the prevention of eczema and allergic diseases. The placebo group
of the study received the same cow’s milk-based infant
formula without probiotics. This study was conducted at
National University of Hospital, Singapore (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00318695) [48]. The Indonesia
at risk of atopy cohort (n = 32) was selected from a
birth cohort study (n = 66) recruited from expectant
mothers who visited Gadjah Mada University Hospital,
Yogyakarta. The inclusion criteria for both cohorts were
1) first-degree relative with a history of allergic disorder
as confirmed by a doctor’s diagnosis of asthma, allergic
rhinitis, or eczema and a positive skin prick test to any
of a panel of common dust mite allergens, which are the
most important inhalant allergens in our atopic population [49]; 2) gestational age above 35 wk and birth
weight above 2 kg; 3) absence of major congenital malformations or major illness at birth; 4) deemed to be in
good health based on medical history and physical
examination; and 5) the family assessed to be able to
complete the trial. Consecutive cases with availability of
stool sample with 3 or 4 time points for FISH-FC were
selected from both SG and IN cohorts. The sample size
was calculated based on study by Sepp et al [50], which

Yap et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:193
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/193

reported a higher prevalence of Lactobacillus at 12
months of age in Estonian infants (63%) compared with
Swedish infants (38%). We therefore anticipated the difference to be approximately 25% with a power of 90%
and a two-sided test size of 5%, 49 subjects were
required in each group. No probiotics and prebiotics
consumption was reported for SG cohort during the
early infancy. Four infants within the IN cohort were
partially fed with milk formula that contained prebiotics.
Written informed consent for participation in the study
was obtained from the parents/guardians of all infants.
The study was approved by the National University
Hospital’s ethics review committee (Ref Code: B/00/
322).
Stool sampling

Stool samples were collected on day 3, and at 1, 3, and
12 month after birth based on collection and processing
produce as described previously [51]. Stool samples
were collected into sterile plastic vials by parents, stored
in the freezer at -20°C and delivered to the laboratory
within 20 hours. The samples were kept cool on a dryice pack during transport and, immediately upon arrival
at the laboratory, diluted with 0.85% sodium chloride
solution (saline) to give a 0.1 g/ml homogenate. After
preparation of the homogenate, samples were fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and stored in TN (10 mM
Tris-HCl [pH 8], 150 mM NaCl) buffer at -80°C for
later FISH-FC and DNA extraction respectively. Stool
samples stored in PFA and TN buffer from Indonesia
were shipped on dry-ice pack to single location (laboratory in National University of Singapore) for analysis.

digestion (New England Biolabs [NEB], MA) was carried
out to digest single-stranded overhangs. PCR products
were purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Germany) prior to individual enzymatic digestion
by AluI, MspI and RsaI (NEB, MA). Terminal restricted
fragments (T-RFs) were analyzed after capillary electrophoresis on CEQ8000 genetic analyzer (Beckman Coulter, CA) [52].
Fluorescence in situ hybridization combined with flow
cytometry (FISH-FC)

FISH-FC was performed as described previously [53]. A
panel of seven bacterial phylogenetic probes was used as
described previously by [51]. These probes were selected
to target the Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium coccoides
group (Erec 482), Clostridium leptum subgroup (Clep
866 and the corresponding competitor probes), Bacteroides-Prevotella group (Bac 303), Bifidobacterium genus
(Bif 164), Atopobium group (Ato 291), LactobacilliEnterococci group (Lab 158) and Enterobacteriaceae
family (Enter 1432). Eubacterial probe EUB338 was used
as positive control, while NON 338 probe was used as
negative control. Samples were analyzed with FACS
Calibur flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, USA). A
total of 100,000 cells were acquired for analysis per sample and bacterial concentrations adjusted to lower than
3,000 events/s. Subsequent analyses were conducted
using the Cell Quest Software (Becton Dickinson, USA).
True-positive counts were determined by subtracting
double-labelled bacteria with background level evaluated
with NON 338 probe. The relative abundance of each
bacterial group was expressed as percentage of total
EUB338 labelled bacterial cells.

DNA extraction and T-RFLP Analysis

Bacterial DNA extractions from stool samples were carried out as described previously [51] using 0.3 g of 0.1
mm zirconia/silica beads (Biospec, Inc) and a mini
bead-beater (Biospec, Inc). In brief, the aqueous supernatant containing DNA will be subsequently subjected
to two phenol-chloroform (1:2) extractions and precipitated with 1 ml of ethanol and 50 μl of 3 M sodium
acetate. Finally, DNA will be dissolved in 25 μl of sterile
TE Buffer (pH 8.0) and stored at -20°C until analysis.
For T-RFLP analysis, 16S rRNA genes were amplified
using primers 47F (5’- Cy5 -GCY TAA YAC ATG CAA
GT -3’) and 1492R (5’-GGY TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT
T-3’). PCR reaction mix comprises of 50 ng of DNA
template, 0.2 μM (each) of forward and reverse primers,
0.2 mM dNTP, 1.5 U of Ex Taq DNA polymerase
(Takara Bio Inc., Japan) and the volume added up to 50
μl with molecular biological grade water. The PCR conditions were as follow: 3 mins at 95°C, 20 cycles (30 seconds at 95°C, 45 seconds at 50°C, 1 min at 72°C), and 5
mins at 72°C. After PCR amplification, mung bean

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS v.18
(SPSS: IBM, Chicago III, USA). Linear mixed model was
used to evaluate the demographic effect and time effect
(i.e. 4 time points) while adjusting for other confounders. The relative abundance of bacterial groups was
used as dependent variable in the model. Three variance-covariance structures (compound symmetry, 1st
order autoregressive and unstructured) were used for
linear mixed model, and the selection of covariance
structure was based on Akaike’s Information Criterion
(AIC) and Schwarz’s Bayesian Criterion (BIC). Linear
regression analyse was used to analyze the effects of the
postnatal antibiotic consumption on the relative abundance of bacterial groups, with adjustment for confounding factors at single time point. Shannon and
Simpson Index were calculated from relative intensity of
T-RF as described previously [7], and were used as
dependent variable in the model of linear regression to
investigate the effects of confounding factors.

Confounding factors used for adjustment were based on
the all demographics factors being studied in this study
and standardized for all statistical analysis (i.e, Linear
mixed model and linear regression), those factors were
location, mode of delivery, weaning age, sibling number,
total breastfeeding up to 6 month, eczema and prenatal
antibiotics. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
All statistical significance tests and confidence intervals
were two-sided.
