Does Glycosylation as a modifier of Original
Antigenic Sin explain the case age distribution
and unusual toxicity in pandemic novel H1N1
influenza?

Abstract
Background: A pandemic novel H1N1 swine-origin influenza virus has emerged. Most recently the World Health
Organization has announced that in a country-dependent fashion, up to 15% of cases may require hospitalization,
often including respiratory support. It is now clear that healthy children and young adults are disproportionately
affected, most unusually among those with severe respiratory disease without underlying conditions. One possible
explanation for this case age distribution is the doctrine of Original Antigenic Sin, i.e., novel H1N1 may be
antigenically similar to H1N1 viruses that circulated at an earlier time. Persons whose first exposure to influenza
viruses was to such similar viruses would be relatively immune. However, this principle is not sufficient to explain
the graded susceptibility between ages 20 and 60, the reduced susceptibility in children below age 10, and the
unusual toxicity observed.
Methods: We collected case data from 11 countries, about 60% of all cases reported through mid-July 2009. We
compared sequence data for the hemagglutinin of novel H1N1 with sequences of H1N1 viruses from 1918 to the
present. We searched for sequence differences that imply loss of antigenicity either directly through amino acid
substitution or by the appearance of sites for potential glycosylation proximal to sites known to be antigenic in
humans. We also considered T-cell epitopes.
Results: In our composite, over 75% of confirmed cases of novel H1N1 occurred in persons ≤ 30 years old, with
peak incidence in the age range 10-19 years. Less than 3% of cases occurred in persons over 65, with a gradation
in incidence between ages 20 and 60 years.
The sequence data indicates that novel H1N1 is most similar to H1N1 viruses that circulated before 1943. Novel
H1N1 lacks glycosylation sites on the globular head of hemagglutinin (HA1) near antigenic regions, a pattern
shared with the 1918 pandemic strain and H1N1 viruses that circulated until the early 1940s. Later H1N1 viruses
progressively added new glycosylation sites likely to shield antigenic epitopes, while T-cell epitopes were relatively
unchanged.
Conclusions: In this evolutionary context, Original Antigenic Sin exposure should produce an immune response
increasingly mismatched to novel H1N1 in progressively younger persons. We suggest that it is this mismatch that
produces both the gradation in susceptibility and the unusual toxicity. Several murine studies suggest specific cell
types as a likely basis of the unusual toxicity. These studies also point to widely available pharmaceutical agents as
plausible candidates for mitigating the toxic effects. The principle of Original Antigenic Sin modified by
glycosylation appears to explain both the case age distribution and the unusual toxicity pattern of the novel H1N1
pandemic. In addition, it suggests pharmaceutical agents for immediate investigation for mitigation potential, and
provides strategic guidance for the distribution of pandemic mitigation resources of all types.

Background
The currently expanding worldwide spread of the swineorigin influenza novel H1N1 virus has produced infections with an unusual age distribution. Early reports
suggest a high attack level for persons between the ages
of 5 and 30 years of age with a peak at the age group
10-19 years, a decline in attack rate with age from age
30 to 60, and very low levels for persons over age 60.
While the virulence of novel H1N1 has been generally
low thus far, comparable in most cases to that associated with recent seasonal influenza, two remarkable
features have been seen:
1. A relatively large number of cases of young persons
with severe respiratory disease.
2. About 35-45% of these have had no underlying
medical conditions.
We suggest that this unusual age distribution and
toxicity pattern can be explained by discernible features
in the evolution of human H1N1 viruses and the timing
of first exposure to such viruses. If the distribution of
cases continues to follow the same pattern, our results
should inform administrative policy, suggest specific
non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate pandemic
spread and direct clinical inquiry into specific mechanisms and possible therapeutic options.
Methods
Data Used
Age distribution data

We collected and summarized the latest data on the age
distribution of confirmed cases of novel H1N1 and
severe respiratory disease available as of July 2009.
[North America (Mexico [1] and Canada [2]), the European Union (EU/EFTA)[3], South America (Argentina
[4], Chile [5], and Peru [6].), Oceania (Australia [7] and
New Zealand [8]), and Asia (Japan [9] and Thailand
[10])]. Early information on severe disease is from the
World Health Organization [11]. The number of cases
for which the age distribution has been reported for
each country is included in a separate table (see Additional File 1). Data for the country with the largest number of cases, USA, are included in Additional File 1, but
could not be included in the Figure because the age
bins that appear in all US reports are neither uniform in
age span nor as fine-grained as those used by all other
countries. Nevertheless, US data are completely consistent with the composite developed here.
Virus sequence data

All human H1N1 viruses with publicly available, fulllength sequences of the hemagglutinin subunit HA1
from 1918 to 1957, and a selection of representative
sequences from every year thereafter including the 2009
novel H1N1 were studied (see Additional File 2 for list
and accession numbers). Nucleotide sequences for entire

Page 2 of 9

hemagglutinin (HA) were obtained from the Influenza
Research Database [12,13].
Tools and Methodology

Predicted structures were generated and manipulated
with Jmol software within the Influenza Research Database. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the
neighbor-joining method and bootstrap analysis (n =
500) to determine the best-fitting tree [14]. Nucleotide
distances were estimated and evolutionary trees drawn
as described [14]. Sites for potential glycosylation were
determined by examination of the predicted amino acid
sequences of HA for the N-X-S/T sequon (X = not
proline).

Results
From the assembled data, we created a composite age
distribution of confirmed cases of novel H1N1 through
the latest date available (in most countries, mid- to lateJuly 2009) for 10 countries on five continents (Figure 1).
For every dataset, we have yet to observe the entire
course of this wave of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Figure 1 captures the early dynamics in each country and
demonstrates that the initial case structure has been driven by the most vulnerable age-group, age 10-19.
Arranged by geographical region, and within region by
shape variation, Figure 1 demonstrates that country-tocountry variability is not large; and what differences
there are develop consistently within a region. Overall
~75% of the cases have been confirmed in persons
below age 30 with a modest peak at the 10-19 age
group. Fewer than 3% of the cases have occurred in the
elderly ≥ age 65. The drop in incidence after age 20 is
marked and uniform.
Relation of novel H1N1 to other human viruses

A phylogenetic tree based on the nucleotide sequence of
representative human influenza viruses that circulated
between 1918 and 2009 was generated (Figure 2).
Among human viruses, HA of novel H1N1 is most closely related to the 1918 pandemic strain and descendants of this virus that circulated in the 1930s through
1943. Viruses that circulated after the re-emergence of
H1N1 in 1977 are most closely related, by HA sequence,
to strains that circulated between 1948 and 1950.
Evolution of H1N1 HA glycosylation

N-Linked glycosylation sites on the HA molecule were
identified in a temporal ordering of human H1N1
viruses (Figure 3A). Four sites in the fusion domain are
conserved in all human H1N1 viruses. The 1918 pandemic strain, the progenitor of modern H1N1 viruses,
had a single potential glycosylation site in the vestigial
esterase domain of the HA. Several new sites for glycosylation appeared in the 1930s and 1940s during evolution and adaptation, but the general pattern before 1949
was that only one to three sites were variably present in

any one strain, with most of them distant from the antigenic regions on the globular head of the HA (Figure
3B). Beginning in 1949, glycosylation sites near the
receptor binding site were generally present, resulting in
a total of eight to ten sites in the complete HA molecule. After re-emergence of H1N1 strains in 1977, a
high number of sites were always present and little variation was seen among strains. Similar to the phylogenetic analysis, the HA of novel H1N1 most resembles
the 1918 pandemic strain and strains circulating in the
1930s, since novel H1N1 HA contains only a single
potential site of glycosylation in the vestigial esterase
(Figure 3A). If glycoconjugates are present at many or
all of the potential sites for glycosylation of the strains
post 1948, and these shield the relevant protein epitopes, persons exposed to these strains are likely to be
unable to generate antibodies that can recognize novel
H1N1.

Discussion
We propose that both the age distribution of novel
H1N1 cases thus far and the unusual pattern of pathogenesis observed may be explained by the evolutionary
accumulation of glycosylation sites on HA1 in human
H1N1 viruses and the immune response to first

exposure to these viruses, the so-called doctrine of Original Antigenic Sin (OAS) [15,16].
Influenza H1N1 viruses have co-circulated with H3N2
and B viruses since 1977. It is unlikely, therefore, that
any H1N1 viruses now emerging into circulation would
be immunologically similar to those currently circulating. Indeed, a recent study [17] reported that antibodies
to novel H1N1 were entirely absent in the sera of children, but present in 6-9% of a sample of adults ages 1864 (sic) and 33% of sera from persons > 60 years of age.
Supporting evidence for the Integrated Position - by age
group
The age group ≥ 61 years - The virtues of Antigenic Sin
with the right antigens

The doctrine of Original Antigenic Sin states that an
individual’s first infection with an influenza A-type virus
produces an indelible mark upon that person’s immune
system including an antibody response that persists for
many years, possibly a lifetime. Though necessarily not
a part of the original surmise, it is now believed that the
OAS immune response includes a cytotoxic T-cell component [18]. Based on this doctrine, persons who first
encountered influenza viruses in the 1930s and early
1940s should produce immune responses upon influenza
virus infection cross-reactive to similar viruses, among

head of early H1N1 viruses including the 1918 strain
[22] present a much closer match by amino acid
sequence to 2009 novel H1N1 than do recent circulating
seasonal H1N1 viruses suggesting the mechanism of this
immunity (data not shown). Interestingly, a similar
response was also observed in elderly persons over age
77 in the US and Canada relative to H3N2 viruses and
the pandemic of 1968/9 [23]. We intend that one possible contribution of this paper be the suggestion that loss
of antigenicity may occur by the addition of sites of glycosylation adjacent to structurally antigenic sequences
in addition to the obvious restructuring of antigenic
sites by direct amino acid substitution.

which is novel H1N1 (Figure 2). Persons born after
H1N1 viruses left circulation in 1957, including the period during which re-emergent H1N1 circulated, i.e.,
from 1977 onward [19,20], would not be expected to
produce an OAS response that would include antibody
cross-reactive to novel H1N1. Indeed, the presence of
antibodies to novel H1N1 [17] and the fact that there
are few clinical cases among those over 60 years of age
suggests that a B-cell mediated antibody response to
viruses that circulated prior to 1948 is probably present
in those age ≥ 61. Figure 3 highlights (in green) three
sites for potential glycosylation all of which lie within
the so-called Sa antigenic region on the globular head of
H1 [21]. The B-cell epitopes defined on the globular

The H1N1 virus that re-emerged into circulation in
1977 was most similar to those that circulated between
1948 and 1950. The year prior, 1947, was notable for a
generalized failure of the seasonal flu vaccine [24], and
it was concluded that a very large genomic change,
ascribed to intrasubtypic reassortment, had taken place
between 1943 and 1947. This change involved at least
five antigenic sites. Mortality associated with pneumonia
and influenza declined by 2/3 between 1937 and 1947.
It did not decline further between 1947 and 1957, the
pandemic year in which H2N2 viruses displaced H1N1
viruses.
The progressive N-linked glycosylation of sites near
those antigenic to the host is an adaptive evolutionary
strategy employed by influenza viruses [25]. The added
carbohydrate molecules shield immunodominant sites
permitting the adapting virus to escape preformed
immunity in hosts previously exposed to less glycosylated surface proteins. As a counter-balance to this
method of immune escape, however, highly glycosylated
viruses are better recognized by innate defenses such as
collectins, and are less virulent in the lower respiratory
tract. The sequential addition of glycoconjugates to the
virus during adaptation may therefore also contribute to
the attenuation of later strains compared to their pandemic forebears [26].
The 1918 pandemic virus had a hemagglutinin (HA)
protein that contained five sites at which post-translational modification by glycosylation could occur [27]. Of
these sites for potential glycosylation, four were located
in the fusion domain and highly conserved. The remaining one was in the vestigial esterase domain and
appeared variably in viruses until about 1950 at which
point it became evolutionarily fixed (see Figure 3A).
Between 1918 and 1947, three new glycosylation sites
appeared in circulating strains, all in areas where attachment of glycoconjugates might interfere with antibody
binding. However, in most sequences of strains which
circulated prior to 1949, only one to three sites were

positions 129 (or 131), 156, and 163 on the globular head near the receptor binding site. The site labeled 129 had the attachment asparagine at
position 131 through 1984, but at position 129 from 1986 to the present; these overlapping sites are mutually exclusive so are represented
together. B) Structural representations of the H1N1 HA trimer based on the crystal structure of the 1918 pandemic strain [27]. Sites for potential

present in any single strain on the globular head. Beginning with the 1949-1950 viruses, the immediate ancestors of the H1N1 strains that re-emerged in 1977, eight
to ten total potential glycosylation sites were present in
these and all subsequent viruses, with four to six of
these located on or near the globular head where they
could interfere with antibody binding and immunity,
including three within the Sa antigenic region. H3N2
viruses have gone through a similar progression of
added glycosylation sites since their introduction in
1968 [25].
Although glycosylation of HA can modify antibody
based immunity, CD8+ T-cell epitopes have been highly
conserved since the 1930s [28,29], and therefore, T-cell
based immunity should be unaffected by evolutionary
changes in HA. Indeed, a recent analysis of both B-cell
and T-cell epitopes of novel H1N1 demonstrates that
only 31% of potential B-cell epitopes from novel H1N1
are conserved in recent seasonal strains (and these may
be inaccessible due to shielding by glycoconjugates as
we discuss here), while the majority (69%) of CD8+ Tcell epitopes are conserved [30]. Unpublished data from
author JAM [Wanzeck K and McCullers JA, in preparation] demonstrate that the glycosylation status of the
influenza virus hemagglutinin profoundly affects disease
pathogenesis during sequential infection of mice. First
infection with a highly glycosylated influenza virus leads

to a sub-optimal antibody response that does not protect mice from re-infection with a poorly glycosylated
variant of the same strain. Re-infected mice clear the
challenge viruses but show severe morbidity and pathology following viral clearance attributable to aberrant
CD8+ responses.
We propose that the relative paucity of HA glycosylation has two effects on the pathogenesis of novel H1N1.
First, it has been demonstrated previously that lack of
glycosylation contributes to virulence in the lung by precluding clearance by innate factors [25]. This likely contributed to the extreme virulence of the 1918 pandemic
strain, wherein a large part of the virulence in animal
models has been attributed to the HA and NA [31].
Similarly, novel H1N1 is highly virulent in animal models, a property linked to its ability to replicate efficiently
in the lungs [32], and likely attributable to lack of glycosylation. Second, we suggest that Original Antigenic
exposure to H1N1 viruses with highly glycosylated HA1
could generate an immune response similar to that seen
in mice exposed to highly glycosylated mutants. This
immune response would not protect from infection, but
would permit viral clearing and introduce the possibility
of CD8+ cell-mediated toxicity in some subset of those
affected. Therefore, persons whose first exposure to
H1N1 viruses was to the highly glycosylated re-emergent viruses that appeared in circulation after 1977

Reichert et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:5
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/5

would have a much lower level of immunoprotection,
and would be at risk for aberrant T-cell responses and
severe lung disease from cytokine storm. In support of
this thesis, an autopsy series of 21 patients with fatal
novel H1N1 infection demonstrated severe lung pathology highlighted by an aberrant pulmonary immune
response characterized by a massive infiltration of CD8+
T-cells into the lungs [33].
For this type of immuno-failure, a mismatch of antibody and T-cell response is required. Therefore, a gradation of responses would be expected within this age
range. An individual exposed previously only to H1N1
viruses with highly glycosylated HA1 could have experienced the appropriate T-cell epitopes enough times to
have a robust CD8+ response, but have little to no
cross-protective antibody to novel H1N1. If such persons were exposed relatively infrequently and to few distinct variants of H1N1, the mismatch would be
especially great. In our composite age distribution of
cases, the peak occurs in the age range 10-19 years. A
shift in case and age distributions to younger age
appears to be a general characteristic of influenza pandemics [34], and there is now a general consensus that
school age children may be important early spreaders of
pandemic disease. However, there is more detailed work
[e.g., [35]] that suggests that pre-school children should
lead and possibly dominate case distributions. Therefore,
while it may be that this extraordinary concentration
derives primarily from the high social contact rate in
this age group coupled with some proclivity of this particular influenza virus, we should also admit the possibility that additional immunological factors could be
contributory. In the US between 1977 and 1988, H1N1
and influenza B viruses dominated in circulation in 8 of
the 12 seasons. Between 1989 and 1998, H1N1 and B
viruses dominated in only 3 of 10 seasons whereas from
1999 to 2008, H1N1 and B viruses dominated in 4 of 10
seasons and H1N1 viruses circulated widely but did not
dominate in 2007/8 [36]. There is also evidence that
genetic divergence within H1N1 viruses was lower in
the 1990s than in either the 1980s or the first decade of
the 21st century [37]. Taken together, persons currently
age 10-19 would have the smallest opportunity to
encounter H1N1 viruses as their Original Antigenic Sin,
and their exposure would have been to very similar
viruses. Older individuals would have a greater opportunity for OAS exposure to more genetically diversified
H1N1 viruses, though exposure for all of these would
have been to a highly glycosylated HA. Young children,
relatively naïve with respect to influenza, would have little opportunity to develop a robust T-cell response to
H1N1, and no prospect for antibodies neutralizing to
novel H1N1. They could be productively infected producing mild disease without the possibility of T-cell

mediated immunopathology. A recent study, also in
mice [38], demonstrated that regulation of the cytotoxic
T-cell response in highly pathogenic influenza infection
may require a fine hand for effective modulation. Complete suppression of the cells required for proliferation
of CD8+ T-cells in the infected lung was not effective in
reducing morbidity or mortality; but modulating the
facilitating cell population using a widely available and
inexpensive human pharmaceutical did substantially
mitigate the impact of infection.
In summary, persons aged ≤ 32 years are expected to
have an OAS experience restricted to highly glycosylated
H1N1 viruses and would thereby be expected to have
inadequate immuno-protection for exposure to novel
H1N1. Furthermore, the subgroup of age 10-19 years
could have had an especially low rate of OAS exposure
to any H1N1 virus. If the mouse data map onto
humans, an OAS response conditioned by a highly glycosylated H1N1 virus could be responsible for the morbidity seen in a subgroup of younger persons. About
one-half of cases with severe pneumonia in Mexico had
no underlying medical condition; and in a detailed study
of a subset of these cases, no evidence was found for
bacterial pneumonia as a co-morbid condition [39,40].
The evidence we cite suggests that such cases should be
examined for cytotoxic T-cell activity; and considered
for experimental therapy with likely modifiers of the
influenza-specific inflammatory process, such as agonists
of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g [38,41]
The age group, 32< age < 61 years: Experience, with a
tincture of time

In our composite of countries, the incidence of cases in
these age groups declined curvilinearly to very low
levels. Persons in a subgroup, aged 52-61 years, were
born during the last decade of H1N1 dominance. The
H1N1 viruses of 1947 to 1957 were more highly glycosylated than those of earlier years, but there was considerable heterogeneity and genetic divergence making this
exposure somewhat rich. In particular, the sites for
potential glycosylation varied more significantly during
this period than after the re-emergence in 1977 (Figure
3A). It seems reasonable, therefore, that immunoprotection derived from OAS exposure in this subgroup would
be considerable, if distinctly lower than in those over
age 61. The associated experience is captured in the age
group 50-59 (Figure 1).
It is more difficult to argue that those aged 32 to 52
years should have an acquired immunoprotection different from those age <32 years, since none born between
1957 and 1977 would have had exposure to an H1N1
virus as an OAS experience. We note, however, that
three of the eight genes in novel H1N1 (M, NP, NS) are
cited as derived from the common H1N1 ancestral line
and a fourth, PB1, is thought to have been reassorted

Reichert et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:5
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/5

from human H3N2 viruses and thence from an avian
precursor [42]. Persons aged 32-51, therefore, would
have had greater cumulative immunological experience
with variation in 4 of the gene segments currently found
in novel H1N1. It has also been previously noted that
infection with H3N2 viruses is somewhat protective
against reinfection with H1N1 viruses and vice versa
[43] This less specific immunological experience coupled
with a non-H1N1 OAS response appears to have produced a susceptibility to novel H1N1 intermediate
between the two age groups with a direct OAS response
to H1N1 viruses.

Conclusions
We have suggested here that the doctrine of Original
Antigenic Sin [44] modified by glycosylation may
explain the age-specific patterns of clinical attack and
toxicity seen in the now waning novel H1N1 pandemic
season. We have invoked the colorful historical label,
OAS, directly, to characterize the apparent relative low
level of novel H1N1 infection in persons over age ~ 60
years noted now by a wide variety of observers. We
have also sought to extend the doctrine and to make it
more specific. The first extension is to relate evolutionary changes in the viral sequences for HA to specific
age ranges. The second is to broaden the concept of
antigenic drift to include the arising of sites of potential
glycosylation in and near regions known to be responsible for neutralizing antigenicity. The first proposed
extension might be validated by data collection and epidemiological modeling of age-specific susceptibility and
case fatality ratios. The second will require studies of
escape mutants generated in a human-specific glycosylation environment. A further extension is our suggestion
that OAS responses to viruses of similar type but evolutionarily and antigenically distinct may be responsible
for the unusual toxicity seen in young persons with
novel H1N1 infection. Validation of this suggestion
would entail the isolation and characterization of infiltrating lymphocytes and dendritic cells in persons with
such infections; and might proceed empirically by careful and controlled clinical investigation in critically ill
patients of agents (widely available and non-toxic)
shown to modify levels of such infiltrating cells in animal models. The low level of virulence of the novel
H1N1 pandemic has provided us with a splendid opportunity to exercise the machinery of modern science to
investigate the characteristics of pandemic viruses without the usually attendant elevated levels of mortality
and morbidity.
The importance of the perspective presented here

1. The principle of Original Antigenic Sin modified by
the immunological response to glycosylation of antigenic
sites throughout the evolution of circulating influenza

Page 7 of 9

viruses provides a consistent and arguably complete
explanation for the age distribution of cases observed in
the novel H1N1 pandemic to date.
2. This integration points to a specific class of immunological phenomena as the likely cause of severe disease in the absence of underlying conditions for the
immediate focus of clinical and laboratory investigation.
3. If the investigation of cases of severe morbidity
should permit the identification of a specific cellular
agent as the likely cause, specific therapeutic actions can
be enjoined ranging from the inhibition of a specific
modulator of influenza infection to the removal or inactivation of specific cell types.
4. It informs administrative strategy with regard to the
distribution of scarce pharmaceutical resources (vaccines
and antivirals) to younger age groups and the selection
of and emphasis upon the use of non-pharmaceutical
measures most appropriate to the affected age groups, e.
g., school closures, discouraging alternative social gatherings, augmented and continuing mask wearing in the
young, etc.
5. The ongoing pandemic is an extraordinary opportunity to validate, and possibly extend the doctrine of Original Antigenic Sin
