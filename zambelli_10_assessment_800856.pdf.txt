Assessment of orthologous splicing isoforms in
human and mouse orthologous genes

Abstract
Background: Recent discoveries have highlighted the fact that alternative splicing and alternative transcripts are
the rule, rather than the exception, in metazoan genes. Since multiple transcript and protein variants expressed by
the same gene are, by definition, structurally distinct and need not to be functionally equivalent, the concept of
gene orthology should be extended to the transcript level in order to describe evolutionary relationships between
structurally similar transcript variants. In other words, the identification of true orthology relationships between
gene products now should progress beyond primary sequence and “splicing orthology”, consisting in ancestrally
shared exon-intron structures, is required to define orthologous isoforms at transcript level.
Results: As a starting step in this direction, in this work we performed a large scale human- mouse gene
comparison with a twofold goal: first, to assess if and to which extent traditional gene annotations such as RefSeq
capture genuine splicing orthology; second, to provide a more detailed annotation and quantification of true
human-mouse orthologous transcripts defined as transcripts of orthologous genes exhibiting the same splicing
patterns.
Conclusions: We observed an identical exon/intron structure for 32% of human and mouse orthologous genes.
This figure increases to 87% using less stringent criteria for gene structure similarity, thus implying that for about
13% of the human RefSeq annotated genes (and about 25% of the corresponding transcripts) we could not
identify any mouse transcript showing sufficient similarity to be confidently assigned as a splicing ortholog. Our
data suggest that current gene and transcript data may still be rather incomplete - with several splicing variants
still unknown. The observation that alternative splicing produces large numbers of alternative transcripts and
proteins, some of them conserved across species and others truly species-specific, suggests that, still
maintaining the conventional definition of gene orthology, a new concept of “splicing orthology” can be defined
at transcript level.

Background
Alternative splicing (AS) is emerging as a key mechanism for the expansion of transcriptome and proteome
complexity in eukaryotes [1]. Extensive investigations
carried out so far, using sequence and microarray data,
have shown different levels of AS in eukaryotes [2,3]
with a considerable fraction of AS splicing events resulting species- or lineage-specific at level of comparisons
involving even very closely related species such as
human and chimp [4], but also human and mouse [5-7],

other mammals [8,9], fruit flies [10] or plants [11,12]. It
is now well known that alternative splicing (AS) affects
over 90% of genes in humans and in other organisms
[13-15], and accounts for the increase of at least one
order of magnitude in transcriptomic and proteomic
complexity. A typical human gene, then, produces multiple transcript isoforms (ten per gene, on average), that
can differ both in their coding and untranslated regions.
Thus, protein products with different properties, or
transcripts subject to different post-transcriptional regulatory pathways can be generated in different proportions in different tissues, developmental stages or
physiological conditions. This widespread prevalence of
AS challenges our perception of what might constitute a
gene [16-18], and even if does not affect the concept of

orthology relationship at the gene level, at the transcript
level requires the introduction of a new concept of “splicing orthology” to identify structurally similar splicing
variants whose products may also be more likely functionally related.
Functional and evolutionary analyses of genes are
usually performed on one or few representatives of their
expression products, i.e. transcripts and proteins. Strict
orthology of genes requires vertical descent from a common ancestor in the absence of intervening gene duplications, and it is often interpreted as indicating
functional equivalence. In practice, two genes a and b
are usually annotated as orthologous if their products
are the “best reciprocal hits”: that is, one of the proteins
encoded by the a gene of species A has, as its most
similar counterpart in species B, one of the proteins
encoded by the b gene, and vice versa.
However, it is known that different gene isoforms may
play different, and even antagonistic, functional roles
that can also be species-specific [19]. For example, the
human caspase 9 gene encodes two alternative products
with antagonistic functions: the longer isoform is
pro-apoptotic whereas the shorter one, which lacks a
functional protease domain due to skipping of four contiguous exons, is anti-apoptotic [20]. While mechanisms
of evolution of patterns of alternative splicing are not
yet well understood, splicing patterns shared between
orthologous genes in closely related organisms are likely
to reflect descent from an ancestral splicing pattern.
Taken together, these considerations suggest that it is
important to extend the notion of orthology from genes
to single transcripts, in order to relate structurally similar splicing variants, i.e. those variants sharing the same
exon-intron structure and using the same homologous
splicing sites. Indeed, the multiple isoforms expressed by
two orthologous genes, depending on their sequence/
structure similarity in coding and non-coding portions,
can be more or less functionally related with some isoform pairs largely functionally equivalent and others
possibly species-specific.
Within vertebrates and other major eukaryotic taxa, a
remarkable conservation of the exon-intron structure of
genes can be observed [21], and this characteristic has
been identified as a reliable marker of orthologous
genes, even at large evolutionary distances [22]. Considering pairs of orthologous genes, each encoding a set of
alternative transcripts, we can detect pairs of transcript
variants employing identical exon-intron structures, i.e.
orthologous splicing variants, with other variants being
species-specific or lacking characterized orthologous
counterparts. It is more likely that orthologous splicing
variants encode functionally equivalent products, while
transcripts with a different exon-intron structure (e.g.
differing in the number and/or length of exons) may

Page 2 of 8

encode products with different functional features and/
or subject to different post-transcriptional regulation.
Human and mouse p63 genes, whose products play
key roles in development and differentiation, constitute
a typical example. These genes encode multiple isoforms, with distinct function and expression patterns, as
a result of the usage of two alternative promoters and
alternative splicing [23]. The upstream and downstream
promoters encode the TA and ΔN classes of isoforms,
each of which in turn includes at least three variants
denoted a, b and g through alternative splicing. Therefore, for this gene we may expect to detect at least six
pairs of orthologous splicing variants (Fig. 1). Notably,
two additional functional isoforms (δ and ε) have been
detected in human, which still do not have known counterparts in mouse [24]. However, while p63 is a well studied example, only a limited number of alternative
transcripts are usually reported in general databases
such as the NCBI RefSeq collection [25] with the consequence that for orthologous genes different splicing isoforms may be annotated in different organisms.
To investigate the extent of this issue, we used the
Exalign algorithm [26] to compare the full set of human
gene structures, defined by mapping human RefSeq
transcripts to the genome, to their murine equivalents,
with a twofold goal: first, to assess if and to which
extent current gene annotations are able to incorporate
truly orthologous splicing variants; second, to provide a
more detailed annotation of actual human-mouse orthologous transcripts, defined as transcripts of orthologous
genes exhibiting the same splicing patterns.

Results
We retrieved a total of 16641 human/mouse orthologous gene pairs from the annotations available in [27],
discarding genes without an annotated ortholog in either
species. We excluded fully non-coding exons and the
non-coding portion of external exons from the comparison, as exons corresponding to 5’ and 3’ untranslated
regions of mRNAs are much more variable in length
and often in number, as well as being less consistently
annotated. Only RefSeq genes having an annotated transcript with at least four exons and at least two internal
fully coding exon in both human and mouse were analysed. This left 12267 orthologous gene pairs. Whenever
the restriction to internal coding exons resulted in the
presence of redundant transcripts, sharing internal coding exons of the same size and reading frame, we used
only one representative in our analyses.
As well as comparing human and mouse RefSeq collections, we also compared the RefSeq transcript collection to the transcripts included in ASPicDB [13], which
collects all putative alternative isoforms for a given gene
determined by the ASPIC algorithm [28,29]. ASPIC first

performs a multiple alignment of all full-length transcripts and ESTs of the corresponding Unigene cluster
against the relevant genomic region, and then reconstructs the putative full-length isoforms by combinatorial assembly. ASPicDB contains, for human and mouse
genes respectively, over 200,000 and 60,000 mostly
novel inferred transcript variants.
For each gene pair, we checked whether each annotated RefSeq transcript showed sufficient structural similarity to a transcript derived from the orthologous gene
in the other species for the transcript pair to be considered as orthologous splicing counterparts. To this end,
we compared the intron-exon transcript structure of the
homologous coding regions with three different criteria,
in decreasing order of stringency:
1. The two coding regions are made of the same
number of coding exons, and these exons (or the
coding part of partially coding exons) have the same
size and are preceded by introns in the same phase.
2. The two transcripts have the same number of
coding exons and corresponding coding exons (or
the coding part of partially coding exons) are: (a)
preceded by introns in the same phase, and (b) their
length differ by 3, 6, 9, 12 or 15 base pairs.

3. The two transcripts have the same number of
coding exons, and corresponding exons (or the coding part of partially coding exons) preserve the
phase of the preceding intron, allowing length differences of any size.
The overall results of these comparisons are summarized in Figure 2. Moreover, a table indicating for each
RefSeq transcript the transcript considered its best
structural match from the corresponding orthologous
gene is provided in Additional file 1.
As shown in Figure 2A, a total of 1551 orthologous gene
pairs (13%) did not produce any pair of RefSeq transcripts
satisfying at least one of the criteria defined above: thus all
these orthologous gene pairs have different splicing isoforms annotated in RefSeq. Using the most stringent similarity criterion 1 we obtained 3915 genes producing at
least one transcript with an identical intron/exon counterpart in the other species (32%). When we applied the less
stringent criterion 2 to the remaining genes we identified
that a further 32% (3979) of the genes had a transcript
with a matching counterpart. Likewise, 2822 gene pairs
that did not have any orthologous splicing match according to the two previous criteria produced at least one transcript pair satisfying condition 3 (23%).

When ASPicDB transcripts were included in the comparisons, the number of human genes with an orthologous splicing transcript in mouse rose to 4098, 4067,
and 2838 for each of the three criteria, while 1283 (10%)
of the human genes still remained without any RefSeq
transcript with an orthologous splicing variant of any
type in mouse. Likewise, the same numbers for mouse
rose to 4115, 4068, and 2896 while 1216 genes (again,
about 10%) still lack any orthologous splicing counterpart in human even including the ASPicDB transcripts
in the comparison.
At the single transcript level (Figure 2B), we analyzed
17383 non-redundant human RefSeq transcripts: 4511
(25%) had a matching transcript in mouse according to
criterion 1, of which 432 were ASPicDB predictions;
4661 (28%) a match of type 2, 283 of which ASPicDB
predictions; 4006 (23%) a match of type 3 (169 ASPicDB
predictions). Remarkably, 5089 RefSeq human transcripts
(29% of the total) did not have any RefSeq counterpart in
mouse satisfying any of the three criteria; by including
ASPicDB transcripts this number was reduced to 4205,
still about 24% of the total (red slice in Figure 2B). That
is to say that we could not find any transcript in mouse
that could be considered an “orthologous splicing isoform” for about one human RefSeq transcript out of four.
Conversely, in mouse (Figure 2C), of 14120 available
non redundant RefSeq transcripts, 4368 (31%) had a
matching human transcript of type 1, of which 294
derived from ASPicDB predictions; 4397 (31%) had a
match of type 2, 143 of which derived from ASPicDB
predictions; 3389 (24%) showed had as best match a
counterpart of type 3 (163 ASPicDB predictions). This
left 2566 mouse RefSeq transcripts (18% of the total)
without any RefSeq counterpart in human, reduced to
1966 (14%, red slice in Figure 2C) if ASPicDB predictions were included.
Thus, for mouse, the resulting percentage of transcripts without an orthologous splicing match is lower
than for human (compare the “no match” bars in Figure
2B and 2C), mainly due to the fact that a larger number
of human transcripts (RefSeq or ASPicDB prediction)
was available for the comparison (17383 against 14120).
Notwithstanding the fact that the prevalence of speciesspecific isoforms between human and mouse remains a
controversial subject [5,9,19], analyses incorporating all
available EST data indicate that conservation of AS
between human and mouse is rather extensive and additional transcript sequence data can be expected to
increase the number of identifiable orthologous transcript pairs. Moreover, RefSeq transcript collections
(and gene annotations), usually employed to establish
and assess orthology relationships, appear to be highly
incomplete with respect to alternative splicing. On the
other hand, we can still expect quite a sizable number

Page 5 of 8

of human or mouse transcripts to remain “species-specific” without a truly “splicing-orthologous” counterpart in
the other species.
Indeed, as shown in the examples of Figure 3 we found
many cases where annotated isoforms from orthologous
genes showed notably different structures, but where
available evidences indicates that iso-orthologous forms
are produced in-vivo. Figure 3A shows ZMYND11, a
gene for which there are two annotated RefSeq transcripts in human (NM_006624 and NM_212479) and
only one in mouse (NM_144516). In terms of structure,
NM_144516 is more similar to NM_006624 (these two
transcript structures are identical, apart from the absence
of the fourth exon of NM_006624 from the mouse transcript). PFAM [30] analysis of the proteins encoded by
the two transcripts (NP_006615 and NP_653099) shows
that the mouse protein lacks a N-terminus PHD finger
domain that is present in the human protein. However,
ASPicDB suggests a mouse transcript sharing exactly the
structure of NM_006624 (602 aa) and encoding a protein
with the complete PHD finger domain.
In Fig. 3B we show HTRA3 which has one annotated
RefSeq transcript in human (NM_053044) and two in
mouse (NM_030127 and NM_001042615). Mouse transcript NM_001042615 lacks two exons with respect to
both NM_053044 and NM_030127, and as a consequence
the protein it encodes (NP_001036080) lacks a C-terminus
PDZ domain that has been characterized for the human
HTRA3 protein (NP_444272) [31]. Nevertheless, ASPic
predicts an isoform identical to NM_001042615 in human
as well, thus suggesting that a HTRA3 protein lacking the
PDZ domain is also produced in man.
Fig. 3C illustrates the potential of our proposed
approach also for the identification of potentially erroneous transcript annotations. RAB15, a member of the
RAS oncogene family, has one annotated RefSeq transcript both in human and mouse (NM_198686 and
NM_134050, respectively). The fourth exon of the
human transcript is longer than that in the murine
mRNA and is responsible for a change of the reading
frame of the subsequent exon with respect to the mouse
transcript, leading to substantially different conceptual
translation products. Analysis with PFAM indicates that
the mouse protein contains the RAS domain typical of
this family, while in the human protein this domain
appears to be truncated. ASPic predicts a human isoform structurally identical to NM_134050 and encoding
a protein with an intact RAS domain.

Discussion
It is evident that the assignment of transcript orthology
relationships based exclusively on reciprocal sequence
similarity can produce misleading results if structurally
different isoforms are inadvertently considered. To

establish orthologous transcripts of orthologous genes in
a reliable way, it is therefore important to take into
account the conservation not only in sequence but also
in intron-exon structure and in splicing pattern. This
argument in itself raises the need to consider a new terminology for orthology of gene products, extending it to
“orthologous splicing isoforms” for which we propose
the name of “iso-orthologous“ transcripts, that is, transcript pairs corresponding to the same splicing variant
of orthologous genes. Here we have also presented evidence that current limited sampling of splicing isoforms
complicates the comprehensive identification of orthologous splicing variants. However, the increase in the rate
and economy of transcriptome sequencing with nextgeneration technologies is expected to rapidly fill this
gap and to allow for more detailed studies of the evolution of alternative splicing, giving reliable estimates of
the number of truly species- or taxon-specific alternative
splicing events. In this respect, it should be considered
that it has been observed that the number of detected

AS isoforms steadily increase with the amount of available transcript data [14,15,32,33]. This suggests that a
large fraction of AS events, particularly those which
appear species-specific, are the result of background
noise in the splicing process [34] and are likely nonfunctional. Consistently, it has been observed that the
majority of lineage-specific exons are expressed at very
low levels [14,15,35] even if, in some cases, the functional activity of minor isoforms has been assessed
[24,36] and/or proteomic validation provided [37].
Therefore, extensive research activity is required to distinguish functional species-specific variants from nonfunctional splicing isoforms originating from neutral
drift in the splicing process, taking into account that
low-expressed non-functional isoforms provide the raw
material for the evolutionary process and may acquire a
function later.
The occurrence of potentially species-specific isoforms
(and the implied evolution of patterns of alternative splicing) also raises at least another intriguing issue: whether

Zambelli et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:534
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/534

novel splicing isoforms should be considered as deriving
from existing splice patterns or directly from the gene of
origin, in other words whether the evolution of alternative splicing can reasonably be depicted as a resolved
tree-like structure.

Conclusions
Our study clearly shows that it is important to extend
the notion of orthology from genes to individual gene
products. Multiple splicing variants derived from orthologous genes may or may not share the same exon/
intron organization or encode for functionally equivalent
products. We define here pairs of variants sharing the
same pattern of splicing sites and exon/intron organization as “iso-structural orthologous splicing variants” or
more briefly “iso-orthologs”. These structurally similar
variants are more likely to encode products with similar
biological function, as in the case of p63 variants shown
in Fig.1.
The large scale comparative analysis carried out in this
study identified iso-orthologous pairs for most of human
and mouse transcripts. However, for about 25% of
human transcripts we were unable to identify a mouse
iso-ortholog counterpart. The implications of this finding will be better clarified by the oncoming avalanche of
transcriptome data from next-generation sequencing
platforms. When a comprehensive transcriptome profile,
in different cell types and conditions, will be available
we will be able to better understand if missing isoorthologous transcripts correspond to still unknown
splicing variants or to species-specific transcript isoforms. Indeed, the identification of iso-orthologs should
represent an important component of genome annotation strategies, comparative studies, phylogenetic analyses and functional genomics approaches, particularly
given the fact that splicing variants can be lost or
acquired in a taxon-specific manner during the evolutionary process.
Methods
Gene structure was retrieved from the mapping of the
RefSeq transcript collection available at the UCSC genome browser, March 2006 (NCBI36/hg18) for human
and July 2007 (NCBI 37/mm9) for mouse. AspicDB transcript predictions were retrieved from version 2 (December 2009) [13]. Orthologous gene pairs were determined
according to the annotations available in [27].
Alignments between intron/exon structures have been
carried out using the Exalign algorithm [26]. The algorithm was run in global alignment mode, and allowing
intron gain/loss detection so to exclude a wrong type
assignation due to intron gain/loss events between the
orthologous genes. The length of partially coding exons
has been adjusted so to include only the coding portions.

Page 7 of 8

Fully non coding exons were excluded from the
comparison.
The first round of analysis was performed by aligning
the structure of every available RefSeq human transcript
having at least two fully coding internal exons with all
the available RefSeq mouse transcript structures from
the corresponding orthologous gene. For each human
RefSeq transcript only the highest scoring alignment has
been considered for match type assignation. In an analogous way, each mouse RefSeq transcript structure has
been aligned with all the RefSeq human transcript structures from the corresponding orthologous human gene.
Then, the same procedure was applied by adding
AspicDB predictions to the set of RefSeq transcript
structures. Whenever the highest scoring alignment for
a given RefSeq transcript was derived from an alignment
with an AspicDB prediction (and there was no RefSeq
transcript producing an alignment with equal score),
then the match type assignment was adjusted according
to the one produced by the new alignment.
