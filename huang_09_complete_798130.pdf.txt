Abstract
Background: Soft-shelled turtle iridovirus (STIV) is the causative agent of severe systemic diseases in cultured soft-shelled
turtles (Trionyx sinensis). To our knowledge, the only molecular information available on STIV mainly concerns the highly
conserved STIV major capsid protein. The complete sequence of the STIV genome is not yet available. Therefore, determining
the genome sequence of STIV and providing a detailed bioinformatic analysis of its genome content and evolution status will
facilitate further understanding of the taxonomic elements of STIV and the molecular mechanisms of reptile iridovirus
pathogenesis.
Results: We determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the STIV genome using 454 Life Science sequencing technology.
The STIV genome is 105 890 bp in length with a base composition of 55.1% G+C. Computer assisted analysis revealed that the
STIV genome contains 105 potential open reading frames (ORFs), which encode polypeptides ranging from 40 to 1,294 amino
acids and 20 microRNA candidates. Among the putative proteins, 20 share homology with the ancestral proteins of the nuclear
and cytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs). Comparative genomic analysis showed that STIV has the highest degree of
sequence conservation and a colinear arrangement of genes with frog virus 3 (FV3), followed by Tiger frog virus (TFV),
Ambystoma tigrinum virus (ATV), Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV), Grouper iridovirus (GIV) and other iridovirus isolates.
Phylogenetic analysis based on conserved core genes and complete genome sequence of STIV with other virus genomes was
performed. Moreover, analysis of the gene gain-and-loss events in the family Iridoviridae suggested that the genes encoded by
iridoviruses have evolved for favoring adaptation to different natural host species.
Conclusion: This study has provided the complete genome sequence of STIV. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that STIV and
FV3 are strains of the same viral species belonging to the Ranavirus genus in the Iridoviridae family. Given virus-host co-evolution
and the phylogenetic relationship among vertebrates from fish to reptiles, we propose that iridovirus might transmit between
reptiles and amphibians and that STIV and FV3 are strains of the same viral species in the Ranavirus genus.

Background
Iridoviruses are nuclear and cytoplasmic large DNA
viruses (NCLDVs), which infect invertebrates and poikilothermic vertebrates, such as insects, fish, amphibians and
reptiles, crustaceans and mollusks [1]. The serious systemic diseases caused by some members of the Iridoviridae
family have made an important impact on modern aquaculture and wildlife conservation. The current members of
the family Iridoviridae can be divided into five genera:
Ranavirus, Lymphocystivirus, Megalocytivirus, Iridovirus and
Chloriridovirus [2]. Typical characteristics of all iridoviruses include the icosahedral viral particles (~120 to 300
nm) present in the cytoplasm; also, the iridovirus
genomes are circularly permuted and terminally redundant [3,4]. At present 13 iridovirus agents isolated from
amphibians, fish and insects have been sequenced completely. These include Lymphocystis disease virus 1
(LCDV-1, genus Lymphocystivirus), Chilo iridescent virus
(CIV, genus Iridovirus), Tiger frog virus (TFV, genus Ranavirus), infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV,
genus Megalocytivirus), Singapore grouper iridovirus
(SGIV, genus Ranavirus), Frog virus 3 (FV3, genus Ranavirus), Lymphocystis disease virus China (LCDV-C, genus
Lymphocystivirus), Grouper iridovirus (GIV, genus Ranavirus), Ambystoma tigrinum virus (ATV, genus Ranavirus),
Rock bream iridovirus (RBIV, genus Megalocytivirus), Red
sea bream iridovirus (RSIV, genus Megalocytivirus),
Orange-spotted grouper iridovirus (OSGIV, genus Megalocytivirus) and Invertebrate iridescent virus 3 (IIV-3, Chloriridovirus) [5,6].

sists of 105 890 bp with 98.5% identity to the complete
FV3 genome. The G+C content of STIV is 55.1% (Figure
1). Computer assisted analysis revealed 105 potential
open reading frames (ORFs), which encode polypeptides
ranging from 40 to 1,294 amino acids. The locations, orientations, sizes and BLASTP results for the putative ORFs
are shown in Table 1. Forty-two individual putative gene
products showed significant homology to functionally
characterized proteins of other species. Forty-nine ORFs
with unknown function have orthologs in other
sequenced iridovirus genomes and 14 ORFs share no
homology with other iridovirus genes. Seven ORFs (003L,
019R, 022L, 026L, 036L, 080R and 081R) that partially
overlapped with others are not annotated as ORFs in the
FV3 genome. The other seven ORFs (023R, 033R, 039R,
069L, 078R, 101L and 105R) have corresponding
orthologs in the FV3 genome, but their annotations were
missed in analysis [13]. The reconstructed common
ancestor of the NCLDVs had at least 41 genes [14],
whereas in the STIV genome only 20 putative protein
products shared homology with the ancestral proteins of
NCLDVs, including proteins involved in viral DNA replication, transcription, virion packaging and morphogenesis (see Additional File 1). In addition, a few noncoding
regions were identified in the STIV genome and this feature is similar to FV3. In these regions, 20 microRNAs
were predicted and are described in detail below.

Results and discussion

Repetitive sequences
Repetitive sequences are not only found in eukaryotic
genomes [15], but have also been identified in large DNA
viruses, where they are involved in genome replication
and gene transcription [16,17]. Similar to other iridoviruses, the STIV genome contains 21 repeat sequences
(Table 2). Interestingly, a 34 tandem repeated CA dinucleotide called microsatellite or simple sequence repeat
(SSR) was closely associated with a predicted gene encoding for a ring finger protein (ORF078L) in the STIV
genome. Such a repeat sequence has only been reported in
the FV3 genome, but not in other sequenced iridoviruses
or mammalian large DNA viruses. These SSRs could serve
to modify viral genes involved in gene regulation, transcription and protein function and modification in their
function mainly depends on the number of repeats [18].
The biological functions of the repeat sequences and the
CA dinucleotide microsatellite in STIV remain to be characterized.

Features of the STIV genome
The determination of the STIV complete genome
sequence was carried out by 454 Life Sciences Technology
as described [12]. About 2.1 million bp were sequenced,
covering nearly 20-fold of the STIV genome sequence. The
individual sequences were assembled into a continuous
sequence using GS De Novo Assembler software (Roche).
The results indicated that the complete STIV genome con-

DNA replication and repair
STIV encodes a protein (ORF063R) similar to family B
DNA polymerases, which contains a nucleotide-polymerizing domain fused to an N-terminal exonuclease
domain. In eukaryotes and prokaryotes, DNA polymerase
is an essential replication enzyme and is able to proofread
misincorporated nucleotides as well as replicate DNA

Soft-shelled turtle iridovirus (STIV), the causative agent of
a novel viral disease called 'red neck disease' in the farmed
soft-shelled turtle (Trionyx sinensis) in China was first
reported in 1998 [7]. The virus could be propagated in
several fish cell lines and caused an obvious cytopathogenic effect (CPE). To our knowledge, although several iridovirus-like agents from reptiles such as turtles have been
isolated, no genomic information on a reptile iridovirus
has been reported [8-11]. To facilitate understanding of
the molecular mechanism of reptile iridovirus pathogenesis, we determined the complete genomic sequence of
STIV and compared its genome structure with other
sequenced iridoviruses to help determine its taxonomic
position and evolutionary status.

[19]. Besides these functions, the poxvirus DNA polymerases could also play critical roles in catalyzing concatemer
formation and promoting virus recombination [20,21].
Some viruses, such as baculoviruses and poxviruses, not
only exploit the host cell proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA) proteins to contribute to viral DNA replication
[22], but also encode PCNA-like genes by themselves
[23,24]. A homolog of PCNA was identified in STIV. STIV
also encodes a homologue of the poxvirus D5 family proteins (ORF025R) that contains a unique D5N domain and
belongs to the helicase superfamily III within the AAA+
ATPase class [25]. The highly conserved D5 protein is
required for the viral DNA replication or lagging-strand
synthesis [26].
Other putative proteins encoded by STIV with known or
presumed functions in viral DNA replication, recombination and repair included thymidine kinase (ORF092R),
virion packaging ATPase (ORF016R), helicase (ORF057L)
and tyrosine kinase (ORF031R) as well as FLAP endonuclease (ORF100R) with a conserved nuclease domain (Nand I- regions). The FLAP endonuclease homologs are not
only present in STIV and other iridoviruses, but also in the
poxvirus, ascovirus and mimivirus [14]. Interestingly,
FLAP endonuclease homologs have been identified in herpesviruses and shown to destabilize preexisting host
mRNAs in infected cells [27]. Thus, the protein product of
ORF100R might function in STIV virogenesis.
Proteins involved in transcription
The gene products involved in transcription include two
DNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunits (DdRP,
ORF010R and ORF064L), transcription factor-like pro-

teins (ORF001L), transcription elongation factor S-II/
TFIIS (ORF088R) and a putative NIF/NLI interacting factor containing a CTD phosphatase domain (ORF041R).
The DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (DdRPs) are multifunctional enzymes and exist ubiquitously in prokaryotes, eukaryotes and cytoplasmic DNA viruses [28,29]. The
putative protein encoded by ORF088R contains a C2C2
zinc finger domain and is homologous to the TFIIS, which
is ubiquitous in many organisms and plays an important
role in transcript elongation [30,31]. Virally encoded
TFIIS regulate the elongation potential of the viral RNA
polymerase during vaccinia virus infection [32].
Nucleotide metabolism
Four proteins involved in nucleotide metabolism were
predicted in the STIV genome, including the large and
small subunits of the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR,
ORF042R and ORF071L respectively), deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase, ORF066R)
and RNase III (ORF087L). Viral RNR is either required for
virus growth or is involved in anti-apoptosis functions
during viral pathogenesis [33,34]. A putative dUTPase
homolog encoded by ORF066R contains five conserved
motifs and a conserved Tyr residue as the substrate binding site. dUTPase is an essential enzyme and plays multiple cellular roles [35]. In cells infected with Epstein-Barr
virus, virally encoded dUTPase homologs function as
highly specific enzymes for efficient replication, or serve
to upregulate several proinflammatory cytokines [36,37].

STIV ORF087L also contains a well-conserved RNase III
catalytic domain that is required for the cleavage of double stranded (ds)RNA templates [38]. Nearly all STIV

encoded nucleotide metabolism enzymes have orthologs
in other large DNA viruses. This is consistent with the view
that the frequent acquisition of nucleotide metabolism
enzymes during DNA virus evolution appears to reflect
specific adaptations of viruses for the different types of
cells in which they propagate [22].
Structural proteins
Despite the emerging information about iridovirus
genomes, there has been little focus on the roles of structural proteins in viral pathogenesis. Three putative structural proteins were examined in the STIV genome.
ORF096R encodes a major capsid protein 463 amino
acids long that shares 99% identity to FV3. Similar to the
MCP gene, the two other genes, ORF002L and ORF055R,
are also highly conserved in all sequenced iridovirus
genomes [5]. ORF002L encodes a putative membrane
protein with a poxvirus conserved region and a C-terminal
transmembrane domain. In addition, ORF055R is a myristylated membrane protein homolog with two adjacent
transmembrane domains and a conserved sequence M-GX-X-X-(S/T/A) for N-terminal glycine myristylation. The
myristylated membrane protein encoded by vaccinia virus
plays a role in virus assembly [39]. The roles of the two
putative membrane proteins of STIV during viral infection
need to be evaluated.
Virus-host interactions
In addition to the essential genes required for virus replication, STIV also contains several putative genes involved
in host-virus interactions, especially in immune evasion.
STIV ORF054R shares 40% identity with the vaccinia virus
3-beta-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase-like protein (3-βHSD), which has been suggested to contribute to virulence by suppressing inflammatory responses [40]. In
addition, three proteins that might be involved in apoptotic signaling have also been identified: ORF067R
encodes a protein containing caspase recruitment domain
(CARD) and ORF082L encodes a protein sharing
sequence homology with the lipopolysaccharide induced
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (LITAF) of viruses and eukaryotes [41,42]. There is also a Bcl-2-like protein (ORF103R)
containing BH1, BH2 domains and a typical 'NWGR' signature motif. Bcl-2 homologs are also found in herpesviruses, poxvirus, African swine fever virus (ASFV) and
adenoviruses [43]. Considering that several iridovirus
agents can induce apoptosis during infection, and that
virally induced apoptosis aids the progression of replication and dissemination [44,45], these apoptosis-regulating genes might manipulate the balance of life and death
in STIV infected cells. In addition, the virally encoded eIF2α decoy could inhibit eIF-2α phosphorylation and block
interferon action during virus infections. Interestingly,
STIV ORF030R also displays a truncated eIF-2α-like protein as well as FV3 ORF026R, which is different from the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/224

complete eIF-2α homologs conserved among eukaryotes
and other viruses, suggesting that STIV and FV3 are likely
isolates of the same viral species.
Noncoding RNAs
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression in higher eukaryotes. Recently, miRNAs have been
identified from viruses with double-stranded DNA
genomes. The computational method has been applied
successfully to predict miRNAs encoded by herpes simplex virus 1 and human cytomegalovirus [46,47]. We
applied the same algorithm to the STIV genome and
searched for 21-nucleotide (nt) sequences with hairpinstructured precursors. Twelve precursor sequences encoding 20 miRNA candidates were identified in the STIV
genome (Table 3). MicroRNAs of mammalian viruses play
important roles during infection, such as repressing host
immune responses and apoptosis, and regulating gene
expression [48,49]. Whether the potential miRNAs are
functional in STIV needs further investigation.
Global pairwise alignment and core gene order
comparisons
DNA dot matrix (Pustell DNA matrix) analyses of STIV
complete genomic sequence with the FV3, TFV, ATV,
SGIV, GIV (Figure 2), LCDV-1, LCDV-C, ISKNV and CIV
genome sequences (results not shown) revealed that STIV
has a high degree of sequence conservation and colinearity with FV3. A slight break was also present when STIV is
compared to TFV. Interestingly, STIV have little colinearity
with the fish iridoviruses, SGIV and GIV, the second group
of genus Ranavirus.

We also examined the arrangement of 20 conserved genes,
including the major capsid protein and other proteins
involved in genome replication, transcription and modification. Given that the origin of virus genome replication
is unclear, the MCP gene was chosen as the starting point
for all iridovirus genomes. As shown in Figure 3, STIV has
a gene order in common with FV3 and TFV, but shows
obvious differences from ATV, SGIV and GIV. In addition,
the orders of these genes are significantly discriminative
among different genera. The presence of inversion in ATV
and different gene arrangements are consistent with the
high recombination frequency in iridoviruses.
Phylogenetic analysis
To test the phylogenetic relationship of STIV with other
members of iridoviruses, the full-length protein
sequences encoded by four conserved core genes, including the major capsid protein (MCP), a myristilated membrane protein, ribonuclease III and DNA polymerase
(DNA pol) were used for phylogenetic analysis. The alignments were performed using ClustalX and the unweighted
parsimony bootstrap consensus tree was obtained by heu-

ristic search with 100 bootstrap replicates. As shown in
Figure 4A, the results from four phylogenetic trees provided consistent evidence that STIV is most closely related
to FV3, the typical species of the genus Ranavirus, followed
by TFV, ATV, SGIV and GIV.
Furthermore, given the significant difference in the
genome length between vertebrate and invertebrate iridoviruses, a phylogenetic analysis based on the complete
genomes of 11 sequenced vertebrate iridovirus isolates
was performed. The results further suggested that STIV is
most closely related to FV3 (Figure 4B). Given the nature
of virus-host coevolution and the phylogenetic relationships among vertebrates from fish to reptiles, we propose
that the iridovirus might transmit between reptiles and
amphibians, and that STIV and FV3 are strains of the same
viral species belonging to the Ranavirus genus of family Iridoviridae. Interclass infections of iridovirus have been
observed by in vivo and in vitro studies on sympatric species of fish and amphibians that can be infected by the
same virus [50]. Whether the STIV infects frogs and FV3
infects turtles are questions that need to be evaluated.
Gene gain and loss in the Iridoviridae family
During virus-host coevolution, gene gain and loss are
likely to have host-specific effects. The acquired genes
could contribute to the evasion of host defenses, while the
lost genes may coincide with either the loss of an anti-

genic signal to the host cell immune system or the gain of
virulence [51,52]. To better understand the evolution of
gene content in the Iridoviridae family, we analyzed the
gene gain and loss events among the 13 sequenced iridovirus agents. According to our strict homology definition,
only 11 clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) contained
a homolog from all the iridovirus isolates. Several previously defined conserved core genes were excluded, including the putative replication factor and proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA)-like proteins. These genes shared
additional homology characteristics such as a predicted
conserved domain, but showed poor alignment scores.
We generated a phylogenetic tree based on these 11 concatenated proteins showing the number of genes gained
and lost at each branch. As shown in Figure 5, although
our mapping of gene gain and loss assumes that gene loss
could occur throughout the tree, reptile ranavirus and
amphibian ranavirus (+2/-) have less gene gain-and-loss
events than fish ranavirus (+50/-24), fish lymphocystivirus (+65/-26), fish megalocytivirus (+86/-19) and insect
iridovirus (+105/-). The variance among ranaviruses supported the point that SGIV and GIV were classified into
the second Ranavirus group. Moreover, both STIV and FV3
gained five and lost four genes compared with TFV during
evolution, again suggesting that STIV shares the highest
identity with FV3. In addition, a number of COGs were
only present within a specific genus. Tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) homologs or TNFR-associated pro-

teins were gained in fish iridovirus and lost in amphibian
and reptile iridoviruses, while DNA topoisomerase II,
NAD-dependent DNA ligase, SF1 helicase, inhibitor of
apoptosis protein (IAP) and baculovirus repeated open
reading frame (BRO protein) were lost in vertebrate iridoviruses. These genes might have contributed greatly in
favoring adaptation to different natural host species during iridovirus-host co-evolution.

Conclusion
In summary, the present study provided the complete
genome sequence of turtle iridovirus. The phylogenetic
tree and dot plot analyses suggested that STIV, a novel reptile iridovirus isolate, and FV3 are strains of the same virus
species belonging to the genus Ranavirus in the family Iridoviridae. The genome data will not only contribute to better understanding the reptile iridovirus pathogenesis, but
also shed light on the evolution of the different iridovirus
isolates.

Methods
Virus propagation and genome DNA preparation
The virus strain used for genome sequencing was STIV
(strain 9701) isolated from diseased red-neck turtle (Trionyx sinensis) in China [7]. Fathead minnow (FHM) cells
were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM,
Gibco/Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS, Gibco). When STIV-infected FHM cells exhibited
80% CPE, cells were collected and frozen at -20°C. The
frozen cells were thawed, and cell debris was removed by
centrifugation at 4 000 × g for 30 min at 4°C and the
supernatant containing STIV was ultracentrifuged in a
Beckman (rotor type, SW41) at 28 000 rpm (~130 000 ×
g) for 1 h at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of
PBS and further centrifuged using discontinuous sucrose
gradient (20, 30, 40, 50 and 60%) centrifugation at 28
000 rpm (~130 000 × g) for 1 h. The virus particle band
was collected and used to prepare the STIV genomic DNA
using phenol-chloroform extraction as described [53].

genome: major capsid protein (096R); immediate-early protein ICP-46 (097R); FLAP endonuclease (100R); putative replicating factor (001R); DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II
largest subunit (010R); D6/D11-like helicase (011L); A32 virion packaging ATPase (016R); unknown protein (021R);
unknown (024L); D5 family NTPase (025R); NIF/NLI interacting factor (041R); myristylated membrane protein (055R);
phosphotransferase (060R); DNA polymerase (063R); DNAdependent RNA polymerase subunit II (064L); ribonucleotide
reductase small subunit (071R); Ribonuclease III (087L); proliferating cell nuclear antigen, PCNA (091R); thymidine kinase
(092R) and thiol oxidoreductase (094R).

DNA sequencing
Sequencing of STIV genome was carried out using a pyrosequencing platform, the Genome Sequencer 20 (GS20)
System (454 Life Science Corporation, Roche). Briefly,
after the quality of STIV genome DNA had been assessed
by agarose gel electrophoresis and analysed by Agilent
bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA),
~10 μg samples were sheared by nebulization into 300–
500 bp fragments. The whole genomic library was amplified using GS20 emPCR kits and sequenced with the 454
Life Science GS 20 instrument according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The GS De Novo Assembler
software generates a consensus sequence of the whole
DNA sample by assembly of de novo shotgun sequencing
reads into contigs and subsequent ordering of these contigs into scaffolds. The average reading frame length was
about 100 bp with 20-fold coverage of the whole genome.
To fill the gaps, 16 oligonucleotide primers were used to
amplify by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) directly from
the genome DNA and the corresponding PCR products

Genome structure prediction
Nucleotide and amino acid sequences were analyzed
using the DNASTAR software package (Lasergene, Madison, WI, USA). The genomic organization was drawn
using the DNAMAN program. Nucleotide sequence and
protein database searches were performed using the
BLAST programs at the NCBI website http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. The whole genome sequence was
also submitted to http://www.softberry.com (Softberry
Inc., Mount Kisco, NY, USA) for identification of all putative ORFs. For more refined analyses, conserved motifs
and domains and putative functions of deduced STIV proteins composed of 40 or more amino acids with homologies to other proteins in sequence databases were
identified using several online programs as follows: for
conserved motifs and domains, http://smart.embl-heidel
berg.de and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/
wrpsb.cgi were used; for transmembrane domain predictions, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0/ was
used. DNA repetitive sequences were detected computationally using REPuter and a tandem repeats finder [54].
The STIV microRNA prediction was carried out as
described [47].
Iridovirus phylogeny
To analyze the evolutionary position of STIV in the family
Iridoviridae, four conserved iridovirus genes, which are
also present in other large DNA viruses, were evaluated
using the PHYLIP program based on the amino acid alignment. Multiple alignments of proteins and nucleotide
sequences were generated using the MAFFT 6 and ClustalX
programs [55,56]. In addition, a phylogenetic tree was
constructed using MEGA version 4 with complete
genomic sequences corresponding to the available
sequencing data of iridoviruses.
Gene gain and loss events in the Iridoviridae family
All the putative iridovirus genes were obtained from NCBI
databases and the all-against-all BLASTP similarity search
was performed. The different iridovirus genes were
regarded as COGs based on protein sequence similarity.
The homologs were determined if one hit the other in the
BLASTP search with an e-value ≤ 10-5 and the maximal
produced alignments covered at least 60% of the longer
protein, while the homologous proteins from multiple
copies of a gene in one genome were counted only once.
Eleven sets of COGs were aligned independently using the
ClustalX alignment program, then the alignments were
concatenated into a single alignment and a neighbor-joining (NJ) tree was constructed using MEGA version 4. Gene
gain and loss events were processed with PAML software
