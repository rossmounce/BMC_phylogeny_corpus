Abstract
Background: Qualitative pathogen resistance in both dicotyledenous and monocotyledonous plants has been
attributed to the action of resistance (R) genes, including those encoding nucleotide binding site – leucine rich
repeat (NBS-LRR) proteins and receptor-like kinase enzymes. This study describes the large-scale isolation and
characterisation of candidate R genes from perennial ryegrass. The analysis was based on the availability of an
expressed sequence tag (EST) resource and a functionally-integrated bioinformatics database.
Results: Amplification of R gene sequences was performed using template EST data and information from
orthologous candidate using a degenerate consensus PCR approach. A total of 102 unique partial R genes were
cloned, sequenced and functionally annotated. Analysis of motif structure and R gene phylogeny demonstrated
that Lolium R genes cluster with putative ortholoci, and evolved from common ancestral origins. Single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) predicted through resequencing of amplicons from the parental genotypes of a genetic
mapping family were validated, and 26 distinct R gene loci were assigned to multiple genetic maps. Clusters of
largely non-related NBS-LRR genes were located at multiple distinct genomic locations and were commonly found
in close proximity to previously mapped defence response (DR) genes. A comparative genomics analysis revealed
the co-location of several candidate R genes with disease resistance quantitative trait loci (QTLs).
Conclusion: This study is the most comprehensive analysis to date of qualitative disease resistance candidate
genes in perennial ryegrass. SNPs identified within candidate genes provide a valuable resource for mapping in
various ryegrass pair cross-derived populations and further germplasm analysis using association genetics. In
parallel with the use of specific pathogen virulence races, such resources provide the means to identify gene-forgene mechanisms for multiple host pathogen-interactions and ultimately to obtain durable field-based resistance.

Background
Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) is the most widely
cultivated forage, turf and amenity grass species of global
temperate grazing zones. Favourable agronomic qualities
include high dry matter yield, nutritive content, digestibility, palatability and the ability to recover from heavy defoliation by herbivores [1,2]. Perennial ryegrass is, however,
susceptible to a number of different foliar diseases. Crown
rust (Puccinia coronata f.sp. lolii) is the most widespread
and damaging disease affecting ryegrasses [3-7]. Stem rust
(P. graminis f.sp. lolii) infections are especially serious for
producers of ryegrass seed [8], while grey leaf spot (Magnaporthe grisea), dollar spot (Sclerotinia homoeocarpa) and
brown patch (Rhizoctonia solani) reduce turf quality [9].
The development of cultivars resistant to each of these diseases is currently recognised as an important mode of
infection control.
The obligate outbreeding reproductive habit of perennial
ryegrass [10] leads to high levels of genetic variation
within, and to a lesser extent, between cultivars [11-13].
Conventional breeding for disease resistance is hence
anticipated to be relatively slow for outcrossing forage
species as compared to allogamous species such as cereals,
because of a requirement for extensive progeny screening
and phenotyping. Nonetheless, major genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for disease resistance have been
detected in Lolium species for resistance to crown rust [1421], stem rust [22], bacterial wilt [23], powdery mildew
[24] and grey leaf spot [25]. The extent of genetic variation
within temperate Australasian crown rust pathogen populations [26] is consistent with the presence of different virulence races [27]. Identification of the molecular basis of
major resistance determinants to different pathotypes will
improve selection of favourable alleles during cultivar
development.
Both genetic and physiological analysis has determined
that hypersensitive reactions in response to fungal, viral
and bacterial pathogen infections are caused by the action
of genes encoding receptor proteins [28,29]. The major
class of resistance (R) genes contain a highly conserved
nucleotide binding site (NBS) domain adjacent to the Nterminus and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain
involved in the host recognition of pathogen-derived elicitors. NBS-LRRs constitute one of the largest plant gene
families, accounting for c. 1% of all open reading frames
(ORFs) in both rice and Arabidopsis thaliana, and are distributed non-randomly throughout the genome [30-32].
Clustering of R genes is known to facilitate tandem duplication of paralogous sequences and generation of new
resistance specificities to counter novel avirulence determinants in evolving pathogen populations [30-34].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/62

NBS domain-containing sequences have been isolated
using degenerate PCR from many agronomically-important Poaceae species including cereals [33-37] and forage
grasses [24,38,39]. In a comparison with the fullysequenced rice genome [31], only a small proportion of
the total NBS domain sequences are so far likely to have
been isolated from Lolium species. Multiple strategies are
hence required to isolate a larger R gene sample, allowing
for structural characterisation, marker development for
genetic mapping, and the potential for correlation with
the locations of known disease resistance loci.
Disease resistance loci of cereal species are conserved at
the chromosomal and molecular level [40,41], and provide valuable template genes for a translational genomic
approach to molecular marker development [42]. For
example, the TaLrk10 receptor kinase gene (located at the
Lr10 locus on hexaploid wheat chromosome 1AS) has
been found to confer resistance to leaf rust in specific cultivars, and putative Lrk10 ortholoci are structurally conserved between Poaceae species [41,43]. The Lrk10
orthologue of cultivated oat (Avena sativa L.) exhibits 76%
nucleotide similarity to the wheat gene and maps in a
region of conserved synteny between the two genomes,
co-locating with a large cluster of NBS-LRR genes conferring resistance to the oat form of crown rust (P. coronata
f.sp. avenae) [41]. The Poaceae sub-family Pooideae
includes perennial ryegrass, along with cereals of the Aveneae and Triticeae tribes [44,45], suggesting that template
genes from these species are highly suitable for ortholocus
isolation.
Based on studies of cereal-pathogen interactions, similar
qualitative and quantitative genetic mechanisms are likely
to contribute to disease resistance in perennial ryegrass. In
order to test this hypothesis, a broad survey based on
empirical and computational approaches was conducted
to recover an enhanced proportion of perennial ryegrass
NBS domain-containing sequences, as well as specific R
gene ortholoci. Candidate R gene sequences (referred to as
R genes throughout the text) were characterised by functional annotation, motif structure classification and phylogenetic analysis. Single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) were discovered through re-sequencing of haplotypes from the parents of a two-way pseudo-testcross
mapping population and validated SNPs were assigned to
genetic maps. Co-location with disease resistance QTLs
was demonstrated within Lolium taxa and by comparative
analysis with related Poaceae species.

Methods
Bioinformatic approach to template gene selection
A proprietary resource of c. 50,000 perennial ryegrass
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) [46] was integrated into
the Bioinformatic Advanced Scientific Computing (BASC)

BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:62

system [47]. Each EST was functionally annotated using
data from microarray-based transcriptomics experiments,
the rice Ensembl browser, Pfam and gene ontology databases. BASC was used to search for the presence of NBSLRR sequences. A text search with the query terms 'disease'
and 'resistance' was used to identify candidates based on
a wuBLASTX threshold of E = 10-15 through known gene
ontology within the genomes of closely-related cereal species (wheat, oat and barley), rice and Arabidopsis.
Primer design for candidate Lolium R genes
Locus amplification primers (LAPs) for multiple target
genes were designed using standard parameters as previously described [48]. LAPs were designed from perennial
ryegrass EST templates, and sequence tagged site (STS)
primers derived from Italian ryegrass (L. multiflorum
Lam.) NBS sequences located in GenBank [39].
Primer design based on Pooideae R gene templates
LAPs were designed based on the sequence of four oat
LGB-located Pca cluster R genes [37], five barley rust resistance genes (Hvs-18, Hvs-133-2, Hvs-T65, Hvs-236 and
Hvs-L6) [33]; and the third exon and 3'-terminus of the
TaLrk10 extracellular domain [41].
Degenerate primer design
Degenerate primers (4 in sense and 12 in antisense orientation) were designed to the conserved regions (P-loop
and GLPL) of cloned oat R genes [37] and were used in
conjunction with published R gene-specific degenerate
primers [33,34,38,49] (Additional File 1). Based on interpretation of initial amplicon complexity, specific primers
were subsequently designed for SNP discovery.
Amplicon cloning and sequencing
For specific homologous and heterologous R gene-derived
primers, PCR amplicons were generated using template
genomic DNA from the parental genotypes of the F1(NA6
× AU6) mapping population [48,50]. For degenerate
primers, genomic DNA from the crown rust resistant
Vedette6 genotype [14] was used as an primary template,
and re-designed primer pairs were used with the F1(NA6 ×
AU6) parents. Amplicons were cloned and sequenced
essentially as previously described [48], except that a total
of 32 Vedette6 clones and 12 clones from each of NA6 and
AU6 were analysed. Trace sequence files were used as input
materials into the BASC module ESTdB [47].
Classification of derived sequences
All candidate NBS-LRR (R gene) nucleotide sequences
were subjected to two-way BLASTX and wuBLASTX analysis against the GenBank and the Uniprot databases,
respectively. Genomic DNA sequences were translated to
amino acid sequences using Transeq software. Each peptide sequence was scanned against the Pfam database

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/62

[51,52] for the presence of known domains, the type, size
and position of NBS domains and the number of LRR
repeats. Multiple Expectation Maximisation for Motif Elicitation (MEME) [53] was used to detect conserved motifs
between sequences containing NBS domains [34].
Phylogenetic analysis of R gene sequences
Preliminary alignments of predicted protein sequences
was performed manually using Bioedit (version 7.0.5.3 –
Ibis Biosciences, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The alignments were
split into two separate datasets (for the P-Loop to GLPL
region, and for the Kin-2A to GLPL region), and were realigned for phylogenetic analysis using CLUSTALX [54]
with default options. Clustering of related sequences
based on amino acid homology was conducted using a
Neighbour Joining (NJ) algorithm and bootstrap analysis
was calculated on an unrooted NJ cladogram based on
1000 iterations using CLUSTALX [55].
Plant materials
Perennial ryegrass genomic DNA was extracted from parents and progeny of the F1(NA6 × AU6), Vedette6 and
p150/112 [45,56] mapping families using the CTAB
method [57]. A genotypic panel for genetic map assignment was constructed of 141 F1(NA6 × AU6) and 24 p150/
112 F1 genotypes as previously described [21].
In vitro discovery, validation and mapping of geneassociated SNPs
PCR-amplified genomic amplicons were cloned and
sequenced and DNA sequences were aligned essentially as
previously described [48]. Predicted SNPs were initially
validated using 10 F1(NA6 × AU6) individuals, and those
showing Mendelian segregation were then genotyped
across the full mapping panel through the single nucleotide primer extension (SNuPe) assay [48]. Integration of
SNP loci into the existing F1(NA6 × AU6) parental genetic
maps was performed as previously described [21,48,50].
Comparative genetic mapping
Comparison of chromosomal regions controlling crown
rust resistance between perennial ryegrass trait-specific
mapping populations was performed using data from
QTL analysis of the F1(SB2 × TC1) mapping population
[17]. The F1(SB2 × TC1) parental maps contained heterologous RFLP and genomic DNA-derived SSR (LPSSR)
markers shared with the p150/112 and F1(NA6 × AU6)
genetic maps, respectively [45,56]. Comparison of marker
locus order between the p150/112 and F1(NA6 × AU6)
genetic maps was performed through the presence of
common LPSSR loci [50,56]. This common marker set
also allowed interpolation of the position of the LpPc1
crown rust resistance locus on p150/112 LG2 [14]. Chromosomal locations of LrK10 ortholoci were compared
between Lolium and Avena species using common heterol-

ogous RFLP loci [58]. Further comparative genomic analysis was conducted using published genetic maps from
cereal species including barley, wheat, rye and oat [33,59].

Results
Strategies for specific R gene isolation
Three strategies (empirical approaches based on heterologous PCR and degenerate PCR, and a bioinformatic discovery method) resulted in the identification of 67
primary R gene templates for host genetic analysis (Table
1). Initial PCR amplification and resequencing using the
parental genotypes of the F1(NA6 × AU6) mapping population allowed identification of a further 35 secondary R
gene template sequences (Additional File 2). A total of 14
primer pairs amplified paralogous sequences, at a mean of
2.5 per primary template sequence, with a range from 1–
12. A total of 102 distinct putative R gene sequences (corresponding to 99 NBS-containing genes and 3 receptor
kinase genes) were annotated (Additional File 2) and subjected to further characterisation. Representative genomic

sequence haplotypes were deposited as accessions for
unrestricted access in GenBank (accession numbers
FI856066–FI856167). A schematic summary of the candidate gene discovery process and further applications is
depicted in Figure 1.
In the empirical approach category, translational genomics between perennial ryegrass and closely related cereal
species (oat, barley and wheat) which are susceptible to
other Puccinia rust pathogens (P. coronata f. sp. avenae, P.
hordii, P. triticina) was used to identify R genes. Perennial
ryegrass amplicons derived from oat R gene template
primer pairs demonstrated high BLASTX similarity
matches to their corresponding template sequences (data
not shown). Primer pairs designed to the TaLrk10 template generated two 1.6 kb fragments, one of which
(LpLrk10.1) displayed very high similarity scores to the
putative oat ortholocus (AsPc68LrkA).

LpEST = perennial ryegrass EST; RG = resistance gene.

The specificity of amplification using degenerate primers
designed to amplify NBS domains was dependent on the
proportion of deoxyinosine (I)-containing nucleotides.
Those based on oat R gene templates contained a high frequency of inosines (>15%) and predominantly amplified
retrotransposon-like sequences (data not shown). In contrast, combinations of largely non-degenerate primer
pairs based on sequence information from multiple
Poaceae species (barley, sorghum and ryegrass) (Additional File 1), successfully generated NBS domain-containing amplicons of the correct size (Additional File 3). A
total of 28 distinct NBS domain-containing sequences
(Tables 1, Additional File 2) were generated, several
primer pairs generating multiple products (up to 7)
(Additional File 3).
The text search-based computational approach identified
23 distinct perennial ryegrass ESTs with high sequence
similarity to known resistance genes from closely-related
species (Table 1, Additional File 2). Amplification based
on candidate EST primary templates was efficient, with
only 13% of LAP pairs failing to generate amplicons.
Additional sequences were amplified from several ESTs,
all were putative paralogues showing significant BLASTX
similarity (E < 1 × 10-15) to known R genes (Additional
File 2).
Database searches for previously-characterised ryegrass
NBS sequences identified 51 accessions from Italian ryegrass-derived clones and a further 14 from an interspecific
L. perenne × L. multiflorum hybrid (L. x. boucheanum). All 6
previously-described STS primer pairs successfully generated single amplicons of the expected size (Table 1, Additional File 2).

Molecular characterisation of perennial ryegrass R genes
From the total of 102 analysed sequences, 89 (87%)
exhibited BLASTX matches at E < 10-20 to known NBS
domain-containing sequences from closely-related cereal
species in both the GenBank and UniProt databases
(Additional File 2). In most cases (80%), the highest
matching sequence was the same for both databases.
Sequence translation and subsequent Pfam analysis
revealed that a substantial proportion of partial protein
sequences were similar to the NBS domain (Additional
File 4). A large proportion of the NBS-category sequences
(55%) were within the NBS domain, while the remaining
sequences either overlapped the NBS region at the N- or
C- terminus, contained the LRR domain, or were located
solely within the N- or C- terminal domain. A range of different R gene sub-classes containing NBS, CC-NBS, NBSLRR, NBS-NBS-LRR, CC-NBS-LRR, CC-CC-NBS-LRR and
NBS-NBS domains were detected, but no TIR-NBS containing sequences were observed. Of the different subclasses of NBS sequences, 52 contained 1–33 LRRs (modal
at 3), 25 contained 1 or more CC domains, and five
sequences contained the NBS-NBS domain (Additional
File 4). A further three receptor kinase and NBS-LRR genes
contained trans-membrane domains.

Consensuses were determined for the seven major NBS
domain motifs (P-Loop, RNBS-I, Kin-2A, RNBS-II, RNBSIII, GLPL and RNBS-V) (Additional File 5) and were compared to those from closely related Poaceae species (wheat
and rice) and to A. thaliana. The P-Loop, Kin-2A and GLPL
motifs were most highly conserved between all species
examined, while the RNBS-I and RNBS-II motifs were conserved within the Poaceae, and the Kin-2A and RNBS-II
motifs were the most conserved among the CC-NBS

sequences. The RNBS-III and RNBS-V motifs were highly
divergent between all species.
A total of 50 different motif signatures were identified by
MEME analysis with 60 NBS domain-containing
sequences at an average of 13 residues in length. The most
commonly occurring signatures were components of the
conserved regions such as the P-Loop, Kin-2A and GLPL
motifs (Fig. 2, Additional File 6). All the distinct subclasses of NBS sequences present either completely lacked,
or contained highly variable RNBS regions. Structural
analysis revealed substantial diversity in motif content
within the NBS domain and grouping of specific motifs
into sub-classes based on shared sequence origin.
Phylogenetic analysis of perennial ryegrass R genes
Phylogenetic analysis was performed based on two
selected NBS domain regions (P-Loop-GLPL and Kin-2AGLPL). Unrelated NBS domain sequences from A. thaliana, lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), flax (Linum usitatissimum
L.), tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) oat, rice and barley
were included for both regions, as were GenBank-derived
Lolium NBS sequences. A total of 38 P-Loop-GLPL
sequences and 104 Kin-2A-GLPL sequences were analysed. Amino acid alignment of NBS regions permitted
classification into sub-families or classes. A total of seven
major clusters were identified for the P-Loop-GLPL region
(Additional File 7, Additional File 8). Candidate
sequences were clustered on the basis of similarity to putative orthologues identified from preliminary BLASTX
analysis. The majority were most closely related to those
from other ryegrass species, although some showed highest sequence similarity to template genes from other species. Sequences similar to rice R genes were also grouped
with flax, lettuce and A. thaliana accessions [cluster C],
and a sub-set of ryegrass sequences formed two separate
clusters [clusters G and H] and may hence be similar to
generic R gene variants previously identified in other species, which were not included within the alignment.

Eight major clusters were identified for the Kin-2A-GLPL
region (Additional File 9, Additional File 10). Ryegrassderived sequences were preferentially clustered with those
from other Poaceae species (for instance, with oat
sequences formerly used as LAP-design templates [cluster
A], and with rice and barley sequences [clusters C and G,
respectively]). Sequences from a number of dicotyledonous plant species were separately clustered for the PLoop-GLPL [cluster E], but co-located in several distinct
clusters [cluster D and E] with ryegrass-derived sequences
for the Kin-2A-GLPL region.

In vitro SNP discovery and genetic mapping of perennial
ryegrass R genes
Sixty-five distinct R gene templates were subjected to in
vitro SNP discovery through resequencing from parental
genotypes of the F1(NA6 × AU6) mapping population.
Genomic DNA of a cumulative length of c. 37 kb was analysed and a total of 819 R gene SNPs were predicted, at an
overall frequency of 1 per 46 bp. A total of 11 (17%) template biparental contigs contained no SNPs, while 27
(42%) of the remaining templates contained under 10
SNPs (Table 2). All monomorphic R gene contigs were
derived from the NBS domain, apart from two encoding
receptor kinase-like enzymes. SNP incidence was low
within introns, due to limited representation in the sample set. SNP frequencies within parental genotypes was
higher for NA6 (38) than for AU6 (20). A further 8 SNPs
with biparental (AB × AB) segregation structures and 4
SNPs with AA × BB structures were identified.

Multiple R gene SNPs from 37 (69%) of 54 SNP-containing R gene contigs were validated (Additional File 11). A
total of 26 R genes were assigned to loci on the parental
maps of the F1 (NA6 × AU6) mapping population (22 on
all NA6 LGs [Figs. 3, 4], 10 on all but LG4 for AU6 [Figs. 5,
6]). SNPs in four R gene loci showed biparental segregation structures, mapping to the equivalent LG position in
each parental map, and hence provide bridging markers.
Five loci were also mapped to equivalent positions on
three p150/112 LGs. A single SNP locus derived from the
template sequence LpHvESTClone1.1 (xlprg50-464ca)
was mapped in p150/112 but not in F1(NA6 × AU6) (Fig.
7)
R gene locus clusters were identified on a number of LGs,
often in close proximity to mapped DR gene loci (represented by SNP and previously mapped EST-RFLP loci).
Major clusters were identified in the lower regions of LGs
1 and 2 and the upper region of LG5 of both F1 (NA6 ×
AU6) parental maps (Fig. 3, 4, 5, 6).
Comparative genetic mapping based on R gene loci
Genetic mapping facilitated map integration between
trait-specific ryegrass genetic maps, and also comparative
relationships with other Lolium and Poaceae taxa. Coincidences between SNP loci assigned to the F1(NA6 × AU6)
parental maps and crown rust resistance QTLs detected in
other studies were observed for LGs 1, 2, 5, and 7. Two R
gene loci co-located with the crown rust resistance QTLs
LpPc2 and LpPc4 in the lower region of LG1 (Fig. 8). A further two loci were assigned to the centromeric region of
p150/112 LG2, 4 cM distant from the genomic DNAderived SSR locus xlpssrk02e02 which is closely associated
with LpPc1. This marker locus group also co-locates with
LpPc3 in the F1(SB2 × TC1) LG2 map, and through comparative alignment, with the hexaploid oat Pca cluster on

Information on SNP frequencies within F1(NA6 × AU6) biparental contigs, preliminary validation and positions on the parental maps of the F1(NA6 ×
AU6) and p150/112 population are provided as applicable. The key for conversion of nomenclature from R gene identifier to SNP locus identifier (rg
notation) is also provided.

LGB based on the position of the heterologous RFLP locus
xcdo385.2 (Fig. 9). The R gene SNP locus xlprg60-216gt
mapped adjacent to a previously-identified crown rust
resistance QTL on AU6 LG7, and in putative alignment
with a corresponding QTL on LG7 of the Lolium interspecific hybrid ψ-F2(MFA × MFB) population map, but a limited number of common markers precluded further
interpretation (data not shown).
Comparative genomic analysis detected conserved relationships between perennial ryegrass Lrk10 R gene SNP
locus (xlprg1-369ct) and the corresponding cereal LrK10
template genes. A macrosyntenic region was identified on
LG1, although low numbers of common genetic markers
again limited the accuracy of extrapolation (Fig. 10). The
perennial ryegrass R gene loci xlprg24-460at and xlprg54688ag are derived from putative orthologues of the barley
R genes HvS-217 and HvS-L8, respectively. Alignment of
genetic maps revealed conserved syntenic locations, as
well as coincidence with QTLs for leaf rust and powdery
mildew resistance on barley 2H and 3H, respectively
(Additional File 12, Additional File 13).

Discussion
Large-scale survey of perennial ryegrass NBS domaincontaining sequences
This study describes the most comprehensive study to
date of ryegrass NBS domain-containing sequences. The
largest comparable surveys were of R genes from Italian
ryegrass (62 sequences: [39]) and from both annual and
perennial ryegrass and the corresponding interspecific
hybrid (16 sequences: [38], all derived by means of degenerate primer-based amplification. In this study, 102 distinct R genes were isolated and functionally annotated.
Bioinformatic analysis identified the majority of candi-

date genes as members of the NBS-LRR family responsible
for major gene resistance in plant species [29,60-64]. A
proportion of c. 20% of all perennial ryegrass R genes may
be estimated to have been sampled, assuming equivalent
gene content to that revealed (545 NBS sequences) by the
genome-wide survey of rice [31]. It is possible, however,
that major rounds of genome duplication or divergence
events between species may have occurred, based on different selection pressures of surrounding pathogen populations. Such factors may influence the relative number of
NBS-containing sequences in ryegrass species.
Structural classification of perennial ryegrass NBS
sequences
Results from the current study suggest that only non-TIR
NBS sequences are present within the Lolium genome,
consistent with previous results from monocotyledonous
species [33,37-39,58,65]. Only degenerate primers specific to non-TIR sequences were able to amplify PCR products from perennial ryegrass genomic DNA, as observed in
similar studies of sorghum [34].

Substantial variation was observed within coding regions
of non-TIR NBS-LRRs, which exhibit greater sequence
diversity than the TIR-NBS sub-family [66]. In this study,
many R genes lacked the P-Loop region, while others contained NBS-NBS domains, duplicated CC regions or
lacked CC and/or LRR domains. P-Loop, Kin-2A and
GLPL motifs were conserved and similar in sequence to
those of closely related Poaceae species such as wheat and
rice [31,58] and the model dicotyledonous species A. thaliana [30]. Further evidence for structural gene diversity
was observed within particular NBS sub-families. NBS
sub-classes contained specific signature motifs between
conserved regions, and in some instances, RNBS motifs

Genetic linkage maps of LGs 1–4 from the NA6 parental genotype of the F1(NA6 × AU6) cross
Genetic linkage maps of LGs 1–4 from the NA6 parental genotype of the F1(NA6 × AU6) cross. Nomenclature for
the parental maps of the F1(NA6 × AU6) cross is as follows: EST-RFLP markers are indicated with xlp (co-dominant Lolium perenne locus) prefixes and gene-specific abbreviations, while EST-SSR are indicated with xpps prefixes, both as described in [50];
genomic DNA-derived (LPSSR) markers are indicated as xlpssr loci using the nomenclature described in [56]. SNP loci are designated according to the nomenclature xlp-gene name abbreviation-nucleotide coordinate-SNP identity [48]. For instance, xlpchijb-240cg on NA6 LG5 is derived from a chitinase class gene (LpCHIjb), and the SNP is a C-G transversion located at
coordinate 240. DR gene SNP loci are indicated in bold red type, and corresponding RFLP loci in black bold italic type. R gene
SNP loci (designated with xlprg prefixes, and numbered according to Table 2), are indicated in bold blue type. Auxiliary DR and
R gene loci mapped using JOINMAP 3.0, but not MAPMAKER 3.0, are interpolated between flanking markers to provide
approximate genetic map locations.

were missing or duplicated. This suggests that the RNBS-I
and RNBS-II motifs may either play a role in pathogenspecific recognition, or be less functionally significant
than other, more highly conserved domains mediating
resistance in plant species [30,66]. Alternatively, the presence of CC-NBS-specific motifs may suggest divergence to
perform specialised functions. Variability was also
observed within LRR domains, suggesting that NBS-LRRs
in ryegrass are diverse in function [64,67].

Phylogenetics of Lolium NBS domain-containing
sequences and relationship to genomic location and
evolution
Amino acid diversity in the P-Loop-Kin-2A region may
account for the major differences between TIR-NBS and
CC-NBS domains. The results from this study demonstrate that TIR-NBS sequences from flax and A. thaliana
group in a separate cluster, as observed in a previous phylogenetic analysis of Lolium NBS domains [38]. Further
sequence analysis of a larger number of Lolium sequences
in the Kin-2A-GLPL motif interval demonstrated
increased sequence similarity with known TIR-NBS
regions from dicotyledonous plant species, suggesting

that this region may be more conserved across taxa. Consensus motif order and sequence composition indicates
that the Lolium RNBS-I region may have diverged from
that of dicotyledonous plants. Similar results were
observed in other Poaceae species such as sorghum, for
which RNBS-I consensus sequences showed significantly
higher similarity to those of rice than to those of A. thaliana TIR-NBS genes [34].
Phylogenetic analysis of the P-Loop-GLPL and the Kin-2AGLPL domains detected at least 8 NBS sub-classes, as compared to 5 separate clusters identified in a previous study
[38]. Analysis of the larger number of Kin-2A-GLPL interval sequences obtained only one more cluster than for the
P-Loop-GLPL interval, indicative of domain conservation.
Inclusion of NBS sequences from other closely, and more
distantly related, species permitted grouping of R genes
and inference of possible common origins for R gene subfamilies. Sequences amplified from oat templates clus-

tered together with ryegrass template-derived R genes, suggestive of a common origin. Based on known mechanisms
of R gene evolution, gene duplication and divergence
prior to speciation within the Pooideae sub-tribe is likely
to account for the sequence similarity between ryegrass
and oat genes, corresponding to putative orthologues
[49,61,68].
Candidate R gene SNP discovery and genetic mapping
The SNP frequency observed within this study was marginally lower than that detected within a sub-set of 11 perennial ryegrass R genes across 20 diverse genotypes [69],
but similar to that observed within DR genes [21] and a
broad range of functionally-annotated candidate genes
[48] in the F1(NA6 × AU6) mapping population. Eight R
gene templates contained up to 90 SNPs per contig, possibly due to paralogous sequence alignment. Large numbers
of haplotypes have been reported for other perennial ryegrass NBS-LRR genes, especially within variable LRR

regions [69]. The data from this study suggests that allelic
diversity within NBS domain is low compared to the
highly variable LRR domain.
Previous studies identified significantly non-random
chromosomal distributions of NBS-containing sequences
[30,31]: 44 gene clusters were detected in the japonica subspecies of rice. Five major clusters containing two or more
closely linked NBS-LRR genes, which frequently showed
low mutual sequence similarity, were identified from only
a small sub-set (26) of mapped perennial ryegrass R genes.
This suggests that the gene location pattern in perennial
ryegrass may be similar to that observed in other plant
species. Unrelated R genes also mapped in close association with DR gene SNP and RFLP loci [21,50]. QTL based
analysis and genetic mapping in wheat identified co-location of DR and R genes at qualitative disease resistance
loci [70,71]. Co-location of R genes with DR genes was
also observed in similar chromosomal regions (lower
regions of LG1, LG2 and LG6) as disease resistance QTLs
which were mapped both in F1(NA6 × AU6) and other
trait-specific mapping populations [17,20,21].

Co-location of R gene SNP markers with disease resistance
QTLs
SNP mapping of two candidate R genes in both the
F1(NA6 × AU6) and p150/112 mapping populations has
provided possible candidates for the major gene crown
rust resistance QTL (LpPc1) on LG2 [14]. To determine
whether R gene SNP variants are of functional significance, further experiments involving transgenic
approaches, association genetic analysis or map-based
cloning are required [72,73].

NBS-LRR genes loci mapping to the distal region of LG1
in the F1(NA6x AU6) parental genetic maps (xlprg29293at, xlprg30-707ag and xlprg61-23ga) are potential
candidates for resistance effects to crown rust pathotypes
which are yet to be identified within Australasia. Major
QTLs for crown rust resistance (LpPc2 and LpPc4) have
been mapped to the lower part of LG1 in 3 different perennial ryegrass trait-specific mapping populations [17-19]
but the limited number of common markers limits accurate extrapolation between genetic maps. Two QTLs of
large magnitude were identified in each of the three populations, which were screened using European crown rust

isolates However, so far no resistance QTLs have been
detected within this chromosomal region using isolates
from the southern hemisphere. As both F1(NA6 × AU6)
mapping population parental genotypes are derived from
Eurasia [50], LG1-located R gene polymorphisms may
confer resistance to crown rust isolates of European provenance.
Comparative genomics analysis of perennial ryegrass R
genes
Comparative analysis of R gene SNP loci and corresponding ortholoci confirmed previously reported macrosyntenic relationships between perennial ryegrass and other
Poaceae species [45] in nearly all instances. The sole
exception was the xlprg8-271ct locus, which was assigned
to LG1 despite being derived from (and highly similar to)
an oat Pca template gene predicted to map to LG2.
Genetic mapping of the LpLrk10 locus to LG1 suggested
that the structure and chromosomal location of this gene
are highly conserved throughout the Pooideae [41,43,58].

The equivalent analysis for barley R gene ortholoci provides the basis for testing R gene functionality in response
to a broader range of plant diseases, requiring significant
improvements of pathogen phenotyping [74] and corresponding genetic analysis [42,75].

Conclusion
This study has demonstrated that multiple approaches to
R gene discovery, including the use of homologous and
heterologous templates, can generate significant numbers
of candidate genes for major disease resistance loci. An
enhanced resource of R gene templates from perennial
ryegrass has permitted evaluation of gene structural diversity and putative evolutionary origins. Efficient in vitro discovery methods allowed assignment of R gene-derived
SNPs to genomic locations, revealing coincidence with
pathogen resistance QTLs in ryegrasses, as well as comparative relationships with other grass and cereal species. R
gene-associated markers are suitable for further evalua-
