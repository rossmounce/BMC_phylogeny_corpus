Evolutionary history of Otophysi (Teleostei), a
major clade of the modern freshwater fishes:
Pangaean origin and Mesozoic radiation
Masanori Nakatani1, Masaki Miya2*, Kohji Mabuchi1, Kenji Saitoh3 and Mutsumi Nishida1

Abstract
Background: Freshwater harbors approximately 12,000 fish species accounting for 43% of the diversity of all
modern fish. A single ancestral lineage evolved into about two-thirds of this enormous biodiversity (≈ 7900 spp.)
and is currently distributed throughout the world’s continents except Antarctica. Despite such remarkable species
diversity and ubiquity, the evolutionary history of this major freshwater fish clade, Otophysi, remains largely
unexplored. To gain insight into the history of otophysan diversification, we constructed a timetree based on
whole mitogenome sequences across 110 species representing 55 of the 64 families.
Results: Partitioned maximum likelihood analysis based on unambiguously aligned sequences (9923 bp) confidently
recovered the monophyly of Otophysi and the two constituent subgroups (Cypriniformes and Characiphysi). The
latter clade comprised three orders (Gymnotiformes, Characiformes, Siluriformes), and Gymnotiformes was sister to
the latter two groups. One of the two suborders in Characiformes (Characoidei) was more closely related to
Siluriformes than to its own suborder (Citharinoidei), rendering the characiforms paraphyletic. Although this novel
relationship did not receive strong statistical support, it was supported by analyzing independent nuclear markers. A
relaxed molecular clock Bayesian analysis of the divergence times and reconstruction of ancestral habitats on the
timetree suggest a Pangaean origin and Mesozoic radiation of otophysans.
Conclusions: The present timetree demonstrates that survival of the ancestral lineages through the two consecutive
mass extinctions on Pangaea, and subsequent radiations during the Jurassic through early Cretaceous shaped the
modern familial diversity of otophysans. This evolutionary scenario is consistent with recent arguments based on
biogeographic inferences and molecular divergence time estimates. No fossil otophysan, however, has been recorded
before the Albian, the early Cretaceous 100-112 Ma, creating an over 100 million year time span without fossil evidence.
This formidable ghost range partially reflects a genuine difference between the estimated ages of stem group origin
(molecular divergence time) and crown group morphological diversification (fossil divergence time); the ghost range,
however, would be filled with discoveries of older fossils that can be used as more reasonable time constraints as well
as with developments of more realistic models that capture the rates of molecular sequences accurately.

Background
Although freshwater lakes and rivers occupy a small
portion of the Earth’s surface (0.8%) and hold a negligible amount of the total water on Earth (0.01%), these
ecosystems support an extraordinarily high proportion
of the world’s biodiversity, consisting of at least 100,000
species or nearly 6% of all described species [1]. While

this enormous biodiversity has been described through
continued efforts by taxonomists, its origin and the
history of the diversification on a global scale remain
largely unexplored across diverse taxa. This is even true
for well-studied taxa such as fishes, which account for
the largest proportion of vertebrate diversity and is the
taxon that controls the trophic structure of freshwater
ecosystems [2].
Freshwater fishes are disproportionately species-rich.
Of the currently recognized 27,977 fish species, 11,952
species (42.7%) occur exclusively in freshwater [3]

(Figure 1). These freshwater fishes are polyphyletic,
being found in 30 of the 40 orders from the bottom to
the top of the ray-finned fish phylogenies [3]. A single
ancestral lineage, however, diversified into approximately
two-thirds of this enormous diversity (7943 spp.), and it
is distributed throughout the world’s continents except
Antarctica [4]. This clade, Series Otophysi, comprises
four primarily freshwater orders (Figure 1): Cypriniformes (minnows, carps, loaches, suckers), Characiformes (tetras, piranhas), Siluriformes (catfishes), and
Gymnotiformes (electric eels). These otophysan fishes
share modifications of the inner ear, gas bladder, and of
the four or five anterior vertebrae and associated elements together called the Weberian apparatus [3]. In a
broader phylogenetic context, otophysan fishes represent
one of the clades in Subdivision Otocephala [5] along
with the orders Gonorynchiformes (= Anotophysi) [6]
and Alepocephaliformes [5,7]. Otocephala itself
represents a sister clade of Subdivision Euteleostei [8]
comprising numerous marine species, including those of
Series Percomorpha [3,9,10].
Although recent molecular phylogenetic studies
have increased our understanding of the interfamilial
relationships within each of the four otophysan orders

remarkably (Cypriniformes [11-18]; Characiformes
[19,20]; Siluriformes [21,22]; Gymnotiformes [23,24]),
few studies have specifically addressed the interordinal
relationships of the otophysans. Following the advent of
cladistic methods [25,26], Fink and Fink [27] proposed
the first explicit hypothesis of the otophysan phylogenies
(Figure 2A) based on examinations of 127 morphological characters. Subsequently Dimmick and Larson [28]
corroborated this hypothesis based on the combined
morphological and molecular data (nuclear and mitochondrial rDNA sequences), although the molecular
data alone provided a different hypothesis (Figure 2B).
The latter hypothesis is congruent with that reported by
Saitoh et al. [4] who performed a maximum likelihood
(ML) analysis using whole mitogenome sequences from
major otophysan lineages. Monophyly of Characiformes,
however, was not recovered in the two publications of
Ortí and Meyer, who analyzed characiphysan phylogenies using nuclear ependymin [29] (Figure 2C) and
mitochondrial rDNA sequences [19] (Figure 2D), which
is also true for Peng et al. [30] and the results of maximum parsimony analysis reported by Saitoh et al. [4]
but in a different manner (Figure 2E). Notably, more
recent molecular phylogenetic studies based on both

families and 1068 genera [3], and the absence of an
adequate timescale for the phylogenies across major
lineages (but see [30]). Indeed, in a review of the early
radiation of teleosts, Arratia [42] stated “... the
enormous radiation of some modern groups such as
otophysans, atherinomorphs, perciforms, etc. is missing
a historical framework.”
To provide an overview of the history of modern
otophysan diversification within the broad context of
the evolutionary history of ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii), we assembled whole mitochondrial genome
(mitogenome) sequences from 66 otophysans (including 51 newly determined sequences), representing 55
of the 64 currently recognized families (86%; Figure 1).
The 66 sequences were concatenated with those from
44 outgroup species for a total of 110 species and
unambiguously aligned sequences (9923 bp excluding
quickly saturated third codon positions) were subjected
to phylogenetic analysis and a relaxed-clock Bayesian
divergence time estimation. The resultant timetree
suggests that the modern otophysan diversity has been
shaped through the two consecutive mass extinction
events on the Pangaea supercontinent and subsequent
radiations during the Jurassic through the early
Cretaceous.

whole mitogenomes [5,6] and nuclear genes [31] have
converged to an additional hypothesis (Figure 2F; but
see [24]), although these studies did not specifically
address the resolution of otophysan phylogenies. Thus,
no consensus exists regarding the relationships among
major otophysan lineages with the exception of the
most basal position of Cypriniformes. Nevertheless,
these molecular studies lacked sufficient taxonomic and/
or character sampling (Table 1) to resolve higher-level
relationships among otophysan lineages, which exhibit
enormous taxonomic diversity (Figure 1). Actually none
of the previous studies sampled longer nucleotide
sequences (e.g., >5000 bp) from more than three species
across all of the four orders (Table 1).
In Otophysi, a great deal of attention has been paid to
the biogeographic history that has shaped the current
distribution patterns. Indeed, contrasting patterns in the
geographic distributions of modern otophysans
(Gondwanan vs. Laurasian vs. Pangaean distributions;
Figure 1), the general acceptance of plate tectonics and
continental drift as explanatory factors for dispersal
across land connections and/or as a causal mechanism
of vicariant speciation, and the presumed designation of
the ostariophysans (Otophysi + Gonorynchiformes) as
“primary freshwater fishes” (with dispersal across oceans
being unlikely) together led many authors to propose
evolutionary scenarios that attempt to identify a center
of origin and dispersal routes through land connections
based on various assumptions [4,12,27,32-37]. Reconstruction of the history of otophysan diversification
(e.g., the history of the modern familial diversification),
however, remains unchallenged, apparently because of
poor representation in the fossil record before the
Cenozoic period [24,38-41], a huge extant taxonomic
diversity encompassing over 7943 species placed in 64

Methods
Taxonomic sampling

In addition to the 54 fish species used in Azuma et al.
[43], 66 otophysans were newly added in this study,
making a total of 110 species analyzed (Table 2). The 54
outgroup species encompass the whole actinopterygians
(ray-finned fishes) from the bottom to the top of the
tree and the 66 otophysans include 55 of the 64
currently recognized families (Figure 1).

Classifications follow [3] except for the recognition of Alepocephaliformes [5,7].
Those species with single asterisks were also used for nuclear DNA sequence analysis.
Those sequences with double asterisks were newly determined during this study.

Specimens and DNA extraction

A portion of epaxial musculature or pectoral fins (~0.25
g) from fresh specimens of each species was excised and
the tissue was immediately preserved in 99.5% ethanol.
Total genomic DNA from the ethanol-preserved tissue
was extracted using DNeasy (Qiagen) and Aquapure
genomic DNA isolation kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.)
in accordance with the respective manufacturer’s protocols, or the standard phenol-chloroform method as
described in Asahida et al. [44].
PCR and sequencing

Whole mitogenome sequences of the 51 otophysans
(double asterisks in Table 2) were determined using a
combination of long and short PCR methods developed
by Miya and Nishida [45]. Briefly, the mitogenomes of
the 51 otophysans in their entirety were amplified using
a long PCR technique [46] in two or three reactions.
Dilution of the long PCR products with TE buffer (1:10
to 100 depending on the concentration of the long PCR
products) served as templates for subsequent short
PCRs. Standard sets of fish-versatile primers (and species-specific primers if necessary) were used for short
PCRs to amplify contiguous overlapping segments of the
entire mitogenome for each otophysan species. The
short PCR products were purified using the Exosap-IT
enzyme (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.) and subsequently sequenced with dye-labeled terminators (BigDye
terminator ver. 1.1/3.1; Applied Biosystems) and the
primers used in the short PCRs. Sequencing reactions
were conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by electrophoresis on an ABI Prism 377,
3100, or 3130 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). A
list of PCR primers used in this study is available from
MNa upon request.

In some cases when multiple bands were amplified
during short PCRs, we conducted subcloning using
MinElute (Qiagen), pGEM-T Easy Vector Systems (Promega), and Z-competent E. coli (ZYMO Research), in
accordance with the manufactures’ protocols. To avoid
PCR errors, we sequenced eight clones for each fragment using SP6 and T7 primers.
Sequence editing and alignment

Mitogenome sequences from the 66 otophysans were
concatenated with the pre-aligned sequences used in
Azuma et al. [43] in FASTA format and subjected to
multiple alignment using MAFFT ver. 6.707 [47]. The
aligned sequences were imported into MacClade ver.
4.08 [48] and the resulting gaps in the aligned
sequences were manually removed to correctly reproduce the alignment used by Azuma et al. [43]. All the
resulting positions with gaps were removed, so the
final data set consisted of 6904 positions from the first
and second codon positions of the 12 protein-coding
genes (excluding the ND6 gene because of its heterogeneous base composition and poor phylogenetic performance [49]), 1622 positions from the two rRNA
genes, and 1397 positions from the 22 tRNA genes
(total 9923 positions) (designated as 12nRTn: where 1,
2, R and T represent 1st codon position, 2nd codon
position, rRNA gene and tRNA gene, respectively, and
the subscript “n” denotes nucleotides). The third
codon positions of the protein-coding genes were
excluded from the data set because of the extremely
high substitution rates (and the resulting multiple hits)
and heterogeneous base composition as sources of systematic noise in phylogenetic analysis at this taxonomic level [49,50] and overestimation of divergence
time [51,52]. The aligned sequences are available from

TreeBase with the following URL (http://purl.org/
phylo/treebase/phylows/study/TB2:S11469).
To investigate the relationships within the otophysans,
we also created an additional four data sets that treated
12 protein-coding genes differently. The first three data
sets considered only transversional changes in the first
and/or third codon positions by converting purine
(A/G) and pyrimidine (C/T) nucleotides to A and C,
respectively (1r2nRnTn, 12n3rRTn, 1r2n3rRTn: where the
subscript “r” denotes a modified RY-coding following
Saitoh et al. [11]). The transitional changes in the first
codon positions are somewhat saturated among distantly
related taxa [49], and the first data set (1 r2n RTn ) was
expected to reduce phylogenetic noise from the original
data set (12 n RT n ). The second data set (12 n 3 r RT n )
added the RY-coded third codon positions to the original data set, which was expected to increase phylogenetic signals and was predominantly used to resolve
interrelationships within the Cypriniformes [11,12], one
of the major otophysan clades (Figure 1). The third data
set (1r2n3rRTn) removed transitional changes in the first
codon positions from the second data set. The last data
set converted protein-coding genes into amino acids
(designated as 123aRTn) to explore the utility of these
sequences in resolving otophysan taxa. Only 66 otophysans plus 12 outgroup species (4 gonorynchiforms + 3
clupeiforms + 3 alepocephaliforms + 2 anguillifoms)
were used in these additional data sets to minimize the
computation time.

ML search using the GTR + Γ + I model of sequence
evolution and saves the top 10 best-scoring ML trees
(fast ML searches). Finally, RAxML calculates more
correct likelihood scores (slow ML searches) for those
10 trees and puts BS probabilities (BSPs) on the bestscoring ML tree.
Evaluation of alternative hypotheses

We manually created the constrained tree topologies
with reference to the alternative hypotheses using
MacClade and then performed RAxML analysis with
each constraint using the -g option. We conducted fast
bootstrapping with 100 replicates as described above,
and the resulting best-scoring ML tree was considered
as the constrained ML tree. The constrained and unconstrained ML trees (best-scoring ML tree without constraint) were used to compute the per-site log likelihood
scores for each tree using the -f g option in RAxML and
the output was subjected to CONSEL [57] analysis to
calculate statistical significance of the differences in likelihood scores. Probabilities of alternative phylogenetic
hypotheses were calculated using the likelihood-based
approximately unbiased (AU) test [58] as implemented
in CONSEL v.0.1k [57]. The P-values from this test are
calculated using the multi-scale bootstrap technique and
are less biased than those of conventional methods [57]
such as the BS probability (BSP) [59], the Kishino-Hasegawa (KH) test [60] and the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH)
test [61].

Phylogenetic analysis

Supplementary analysis using nuclear genes

Unambiguously aligned sequences were divided into
three to five partitions depending on the data sets (three
partitions in the 123aRTn data set, four partitions in the
12nRTn and 1r2nRTn data sets, and five partitions in the
12n3rRTn and 1r2n3rRTn data sets) and subjected to ML
analysis. We used RAxML ver. 7.2.8 [53] because it is
the only ML-based software that can handle large data
sets with data partitioning. A general time reversible
model (GTR) [54] with sites following a discrete gamma
distribution (Γ) and some sites invariable (I) was
selected as the best model of nucleotide sequence evolution by Modeltest ver. 3.7 [55] using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). For amino acid sequences, the
MTREV model [56] with sites following a discrete
gamma distribution (Γ) and some sites invariable (I) was
used. We performed a rapid bootstrap (BS) analysis
using this model (GTR + Γ + I) with 1000 replications
(-f a option). This performs BS analysis using GTRCAT,
which is a GTR approximation with optimization of
individual per-site substitution rates and classification of
these individual rates into a certain number of rate categories. After implementing the BS analysis, the program
uses every fifth BS tree as a starting point for another

To corroborate the novel relationships among major
otophysan lineages obtained in this study (see below),
we determined some of the putative single-copy nuclear
gene sequences for the selected four otophysans (asterisks in Table 2) according to the methods described by
Li et al. [31] (Table 3). We have added these sequences
to the aligned data set used in Li et al. (available from
http://www.treebase.org/treebase-web/home.html;
newID: M3165) who studied actinopterygian phylogenies
with 56 species (including three cypriniforms and three
characiphysans), and the data set was subjected to partitioned ML analysis according to Kawahara et al. [62].
Divergence time estimation

A relaxed molecular clock Bayesian method implemented in the MCMCTREE program in PAML 4.4b [63]
was used for dating analysis. We also attempted to use
BEAST [64] for our data set, but MCMC samples failed
to converge after 108 chains. The best-scoring ML tree
from the 12nRTn data set was used for divergence time
estimation. The ML estimates of branch lengths were
obtained using BASEML and CODEML (in PAML)
programs under the GTR + Γ 5 and MTREVF + Γ 5

substitution models [54] for the 12nRTn and 123a data
sets, respectively, with the gamma prior set at 0.5. Two
priors, the overall substitution rate (rgene gamma) and
rate-drift parameter (sigma2 gamma), were set at
G (1, 12.3) and G (1, 4.45) for the 12nRTn data set and
G (1, 14.3) and G (1, 4.5) for the 123a data set, respectively, using the strict molecular clock assumption with
445 Ma constraint to the divergence between Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii (average of the upper and

lower constraints for the node between ray-finned and
lobe-finned fish; see Table 4). The independent-rates
(IR) model [65] was used to specify the prior of rates
among internal nodes (clock = 2 in MCMCTREE). The
IR model has been considered more appropriate in
divergence time estimation than the autocorrelated-rates
(AR) model in recent studies (see [66] and references
therein), although additional analyses using AR model
(clock = 3 in MCMCTREE) were also performed for

comparison. The parameters of the birth-death process
for tree generation with species sampling [67] were
fixed at l = μ = 1 and r = 0, so that the priors are similar to those used in the previous mitogenomic studies
[43,68] using MULTIDIVTIME [69]. A loose maximum
bound for the root was set at <10.0 (= 1000 Ma).
The MCMCTREE program allows for minimum
(lower) and maximum (upper) time constraints, and
multiple calibration points have been argued to provide overall more realistic divergence time estimates
[70]. Therefore we sought to obtain optimal phylogenetic coverage of calibration points across our tree,
although we could set maximum constraints based on
the fossil records only for the six nodes (Table 4).
Other than these six nodes, 17 additional nodes were
reasonably chosen to constraint their minimum ages
only (total 29 time constraints for 23 nodes; Table 4).
A hard and softbound version of the program
(MCMCTREE-HS) was used, so that probabilities of
the true divergence time falling outside the minimum
bounds are zero, but small but not zero for the maximum bounds [71]. All time constraints are provided in
units of 100 Ma (i.e., 1 = 100 Ma) because some of the
model components in the Bayesian analysis are scalevariant [63]. The calibration nodes with minimal
bound only were set as L (t min ) and those with both
minimal and maximal bounds were set as B (t min ,
t max ). The former setting (L) assumes a heavy-tailed
density (nearly a flat prior) based on a truncated
Cauchy distribution of p = 0.1 and c = 1 as the default
[63] ("standard minimum-age constraints” [72]). We
did not manipulate the two shape parameters of the
truncated Cauchy distribution because of insufficient
information with which to specify meaningful prior
distributions for most otophysan diversification times.
MCMC approximation with a burn-in period of
10,000 cycles was obtained, and every 50 cycles was
taken to create a total of 10,000 samples. To diagnose
possible failure of the Markov chains to converge to
their stationary distribution, we performed two replicate MCMC runs with two different random seeds for
each analysis. MCMC samples from the two runs were
combined after checking the distributions of parameter
values using Tracer 1.5 (available from http://tree.bio.
ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/). The number of samples
(20,000) was large enough to reach effective sample
sizes (ESSs >200) for all parameters estimated in this
study.
To evaluate the effects of topological uncertainties
on divergence time estimation, we also conducted dating analyses with four of the 14 alternative topologies
(four topologies with the second best P value, the two
worst P values, plus a hypothesis advocated by Fink
and Fink [27]).

Tracing character evolution

The ancestral habitat was reconstructed on the timetree
under a ML optimality criterion using Mesquite ver.
2.71 [73]. The ML reconstruction methods found that
the ancestral states maximizing the probability of the
observed states would evolve under a stochastic model
of evolution [74,75]. The Mk1 model ("Markov k-state 1
parameter model”), a k-state generalization of the JukesCantor model that corresponds to Lewis’ Mk model
[76], was used to trace the character evolution. Two
character states were assigned to the terminal node: saltwater (character state 0) and freshwater (state 1).

Results and Discussion
Genome organization

Complete L-strand nucleotide sequences from the mitogenomes of the 51 species newly determined during this
study were deposited in the DNA Data Bank of Japan
(DDBJ), European Molecular Biology Laboratory
(EMBL), and GenBank (Table 2). The genome content
of the 51 species included two rRNA, 22 tRNA, and 13
protein-coding genes, plus the putative control region,
as found in other vertebrates. Their gene arrangements
were identical to the typical gene order of vertebrates.
Interordinal/subordinal relationships

Partitioned ML analysis based on 110 whole mitogenome sequences (12nRTn data set) resulted in a relatively
well resolved tree, with approximately 70% of the internal branches supported by moderate to high (70-100%)
BSPs (Figure 3). Otocephala was confidently recovered
as a monophyletic group (BSP = 100%) and a clade containing two primarily marine orders (Clupeiformes and
Alepocephaliformes) was sister to all other otocephalans.
Gonorynchiformes was recovered as the sister group of
Otophysi (BSP = 82%) and monophyly of the latter was
confidently recovered (BSP = 100%; Figure 3), confirming the results of recent molecular studies [5,7,31]. Of
the four orders within the otophysans, monophyletic
Cypriniformes (BSP = 100%) was a sister to a clade containing the remaining three orders collectively called
Characiphysi (BSP = 100%). Of the three characiphysan
orders, Gymnotiformes and Siluriformes were
confidently recovered as monophyletic groups (BSPs =
100%); however, one of the two suborders of Characiformes (Characoidei) was more closely related to
Siluriformes (BSP = 79%) than to the other (Citharinoidei). Statistical support for a clade containing these
three lineages (Citharinoidei, Characoidei, Siluriformes),
however, was not strong (BSP = 67%).

protein-coding genes into amino acid sequences
(123a RT n) together supported the novel relationships,
although they did not improve the statistical support
(<50-67% BSPs for Citharinoidei + Characoidei + Siluriformes and 59-80% BSPs for Characoidei + Siluriformes)
(Figure 4).
Although taxonomic sampling from otophysans in the
nuclear data set was far sparser than that of the mitogenomic data set (10 spp. vs. 66 spp.), and data were missing in the original as well as newly added sequences
(approximately 25% of the total positions; Table 3), partitioned ML analysis based on the 10 nuclear genes
from the 60 species resulted in an identical tree topology to that of the mitogenomic tree regarding the relationships among the major otophysan lineages
(Figure 5). Monophyly of Otophysi was confidently
recovered at the apical position in Otocephala (BSP =
100%), with Cypriniformes being a sister to all other
otophysans. Within the Characiphysi, Gymnotiformes
was a sister to other characiphysans and monophyly of
Characiformes plus Siluriformes was supported with
100% BSP (67% BSP in mitogenomic analysis; Figure 3),
although the former was found to be paraphyletic, with
Characoidei being more closely related to Siluriformes
(BSP = 52%) than to Citharinoidei.
Paraphyletic characiforms have been repeatedly recovered in previous molecular studies (Figure 2C-E) but in
different manners. For example, Ortí and Meyer [29]
assembled nuclear ependymin sequences (588 bp) from
22 otophysans to explore the phylogenetic utility of this
gene and found that characoids were more closely
related to Gymnotiformes than to a citharinoid (Distichodus) (Figure 2C). To investigate the characiform
radiation, Ortí and Meyer [19] used partial mitochondrial rDNA sequences (870 bp) as phylogenetic markers
and observed that two citharinoids (Distichodus and
Citharinus) were more closely related to Siluriformes
than to characoids (Figure 2D). Although analyses of
whole mitogenome sequences by Saitoh et al. [4] (maximum parsimony analysis of 8096 bp) and Peng et al.
[30] (6198 bp) did not include citharinoids, one of the
two characoids were more closely related to either Siluriformes or Gymnotiformes than to its own order (Figure
2E). These relationships, however, received weak statistical support (<50% BSPs) and alternative tree topologies
could not be rejected [4,19,29].
Monophyly of Characiformes should be addressed in
relation to the other two characiphysan orders. Accordingly, we evaluated the likelihoods of alternative hypotheses among four major characiphysan lineages
(Gymnotiformes, Citharinoidei, Characoidei, Siluriformes) using the AU test (Table 5). Of the 15 possible
tree topologies based on the mitogenomic data, AU
tests confidently rejected only three that commonly

Page 12 of 25

included the monophyly of Characoidei plus Gymnotiformes (P = 0.001-0.030; Table 5), with likelihoods of
the other 12 topologies ranging from 0.051 to 0.702.
Moreover, AU tests based on the nuclear data more
confidently rejected 12 tree topologies (P = 0.000-0.006;
Table 6). For either marker, however, AU tests could
not reject all of those topologies that included monophyletic Characiformes, and this issue therefore remains
unanswered even in the molecular phylogenetic context.
Apparently the two deep-branching lineages in the characiforms (Citharinoidei and Characoidei) make it difficult to resolve their relationships with Siluriformes even
with the large data sets used in this study. Also we
expect that future uses of newly developed models
accounting for site-specific modulations of the aminoacid replacement process, such as the CAT mixture
model [77] implemented in PhyloBayes [78], may result
in more clear resolution of the characiphysan phylogenies. Note that monophyletic Characiformes was well
accepted and seemingly uncontroversial on a morphological basis [27,79-81].
Interfamilial relationships

Interfamilial relationships within each of the four major
lineages are outside the scope of this study because
taxonomic sampling is still sparse and requires at least
several distantly related genera from the same family to
reconstruct more reliable trees. Nevertheless, brief comparisons with previous studies are useful to direct future
research.
In Cypriniformes, monophyly of one of the two superfamilies (Cyprinoidea) was consistently recovered, while
another superfamily (Cobitoidea) has been variously
recovered as mono- or paraphyletic depending on the
data treatment (most notably that of the third codon
position) even within some of the same studies [11-17].
An enigmatic Psilorhynchus (placed in its own family
Psilorhynchidae) is nested within the cyprinid lineage
(Cyprinus + Danio; Figure 3), rendering Cyprinidae
paraphyletic as reported previously [15,17,18].
In Gymnotiformes, a sister group relationship between
two gymnotids (Electrophorus and Gymnotus) was confidently recovered (BSP = 90%), but other portions of the
tree were weakly supported (BSPs ≤58%; Figure 3) and
do not warrant further comment. Such ambiguous interfamilial relationships have been reported in previous
studies based on mitochondrial rDNA sequences [23,24].
In Citharinoidei, one of the two suborders of Characiformes, two distichodontid genera (Distichodus and
Ichthyborus) formed a strongly supported monophyletic
group (BSP = 100%), which was sister to a citharinid
(Citharinus). These relationships have been consistently
recovered in previous studies based on both morphological [79,82] and molecular [19,20,83] analyses. Within

Charachoidei, another suborder of Characiformes, basal
relationships were poorly resolved and only four of the
19 internal branches that connect two species from the
same families received the highest statistical support
(100% BSPs; Figure 3). With the exception of such
ambiguous basal relationships, the resulting phylogenies
showed several similarities to those reported by Calcagnotto et al. [20], who analyzed four nuclear and two
mitochondrial genes across 124 characiform taxa. In

Table 6 Results from AU-tests among 15 alternative tree

analysis of 10 nuclear gene sequences

particular, we confirmed that the two African lineages
represented by Hepsetidae (Hepsetus) and Alestidae
(Phenacogrammus and Micralestes) did not form a
monophyletic group, but were nested in the same clade
with strictly Neotropical species, such as Hydrolycus
(Cynodontidae) and Hoplias (Erythrinidae) (Figure 3).
In Siluriformes, monophyly of the two currently
recognized suborders (Loricaroidei, Siluroidei [21]) was
confirmed and the Loricaroidei was recovered as sister
to other clades, followed by the divergence of Diplomystoidei and Siluroidei (BSP = 82%; Figure 3). These basal
divergences are fully congruent with the results of a
recent molecular phylogenetic study by Sullivan et al.
[21], who analyzed two nuclear genes across 110 catfish
species representing 36 of 37 families. Thus, the two different lines of evidence support the most basal Loricaroidei in the siluriform phylogenies. Note that previous
morphological studies have consistently argued the most
basal Diplomystoidei ([41,84-89]), which was supported
by a molecular study by Hardman [22], who used
Diplomystes mesembrinus (Diplomystidae) as the only
outgroup to root the tree. Within the Loricaroidei, a sister group relationship between Pterygoplichthys (Loricaridae) and Astroblepus (Astroblepidae) was strongly
supported as in previous morphological and molecular
studies [21,89]. As in the Characoidei, basal relationships in the Siluroidei were poorly resolved and only
five of the 23 internal branches received high statistical
support (≥95% BSPs; Figure 3). Nevertheless we recovered some of the suprafamilial clades reported by Sullivan et al. [21], and list them below with genera used in
this study (Figure 3): “Big Asia” (Pseudobagrus, Hara,
Liobagrus), “Claroidea (Cla)” (Clarias, Heteropneustes),
“Aspredinidae + Doradoidea (Asp + Dor)” (Bunocephalus, Amblydoras, Tatia, Tetranematichthys), “Ictaluroidea (Ict)” (Ictalurus, Cranoglanis), and “Big Africa”

MCMCTREE analyses of the divergence times based on
the two data sets (12nRTn and 123a) with the assumption of independent rates (IR) across nodes yielded similar estimated node ages (see Additional file 1). Overall
dating analysis based on the nucleotide data set
(12nRTn) provided slightly older node ages (absolute differences in posterior means: 16.3 million years ± 21.5
SD) with consistently smaller 95% credible intervals
(absolute differences: 30.3 million years ± 23.0 SD) than
those from the amino acid data set (123a). Consequently
the 95% credible intervals from both data sets greatly
overlapped with each other across all nodes. These
tendencies held true for the estimated node ages from
the most recent common ancestors (MRCAs) of the five

major otophysan lineages themselves (Cypriniformes,
Gymnotiformes, Citharinoidei, Characoidei, Siluriformes) and those from MRCAs comprising subsets of
these five lineages (total = nine nodes), with the absolute
difference in posterior means of 17.8 million years ± 5.7
SD. Considering the long evolutionary history of actinopterygians (≈ 450 million years), the differences seem
minor and the following description and discussion of
the results were based on the nucleotide data set
(12nRTn) for simplicity.
MCMC analysis based on the 12 n RT n data set indicated that an ancestral lineage of the modern otophysans diverged from a stem ostariophysan during the
end-Permian about 261 Ma with a 95% credible interval
of 240-282 Ma (Figure 6). Basal otophysan divergences
that produced common ancestors of the five modern
lineages were estimated to occur in a relatively short
time window during the Triassic (251-200 Ma): divergences between Cypriniformes and Characiphysi = 248
Ma (with a 95% credible interval of 227-268 Ma); Gymnotiformes and Characiformes + Siluriformes = 226 Ma
(206-245 Ma); Citharinoidei and Characoidei + Siluriformes 220 Ma (201-240 Ma), Characoidei and Siluriformes 216 Ma (198-237 Ma). The origins of these
ancestral lineages were followed by the onset of radiations in each lineage during the Jurassic (200-146 Ma),
with the estimated ages of the most recent common
ancestor (MRCA) of the modern Cypriniformes = 160
Ma (130-186 Ma); Gymnotiformes = 189 Ma (166-212
Ma); Citharinoidei = 160 Ma (124-190 Ma); Characoidei
= 192 (172-213 Ma); and Siluriformes = 180 Ma (162198 Ma). For the summary of MCMC samples for node
ages and entire timetree including non-otophysans, see
Additional files 2 and 3, respectively.
We confirmed that uncertainties in relationships
among major characiphysan lineages (Gymnotiformes,
Citharinoidei, Characoidei, Siluriformes) least affect
divergence time estimates, with the largest difference
being only 10 million years (Table 7). In addition,
despite the use of the IR model across nodes using
MCMCTREE in the present study, the resulting ages for
selected nodes were very similar to those reported in
previous studies employing the AR model using MULTIDIVTIME [43,68] (Table 8). When the AR model was
used in MCMCTREE (clock = 3), differences in the
resulting node ages were minor, with absolute differences in posterior means of 0.7 million years ± 16.4 SD
(Additional file 1). Thus, the topological uncertainties
and use of the different models of rate variations across
nodes (and associated software) did not affect the divergence time estimates, at least in the present data set.
Our age estimates, however, are remarkably older than
those indicated in previous reports based on the fossil
record [43,68,90-92]. For example, the oldest

Page 16 of 25

otocephalan fossil discovered to date was from the Late
Jurassic 150 Ma [93], while our estimate was 265 Ma.
The oldest otophysan fossil record dates back to the
Albian (100-112 Ma) [94], while our estimate was 248
Ma. For all other major otophysan lineages, our molecular estimates (from 160 Ma in Cypriniformes to 220 Ma
in Characiformes) are over 100 million years older than
those of the fossil records used as minimum constraints
(from 8 Ma in Gymnotiformes to 98 Ma in Characiformes; Table 4). Azuma et al. [43] also noted such
large differences and plotted minimum time constraints
based on the fossil record against molecular time estimates of the corresponding nodes. They found that four
data points in the Paleozoic showed a fairly good 1:1
relationship, whereas other points in the Mesozoic were
considerably below the line of a 1:1 relationship. They
considered that these significant departures from the
expected relationships for the Mesozoic fossils may
reflect the fact that they do not really represent the oldest fossil for the corresponding lineages.
For such remarkably older molecular estimates, Benton and Ayala [51] noted four pervasive biases that may
cause molecular dates to be too old: 1) the calibration
dates that are too old based on previous molecular studies; 2) undetected rapidly evolving genes; 3) an ancestral polymorphism that was maintained through a long
evolutionary period; and 4) asymmetric distributions of
estimated times, with a constrained younger end but an
unconstrained older end. As discussed by Azuma et al.
[43], whose data set formed the basis of this study, the
first factor is not the case in the present study because
we did not use calibration dates based on previous
molecular studies. The third factor would be applicable
when the genomic regions used are under long-term
balancing selection, but no mitochondrial genes have
been reported to be under such selection. Neither the
second factor nor the fourth factor are true in this study
because quickly saturated third codon positions and the
control region were excluded from the present analysis,
and because each mitochondrial gene used here was
tested and shown to perform well for dating vertebrate
divergences [95]. We agree with the arguments of
Azuma et al. [43] as well as those of Benton and Ayala
[51], who stated that “careful choice of genes may be a
more appropriate strategy (than the larger data strategy),
with a focus on long and fast-evolving (yet alignable)
sequences” for reliable dating. Whole mitogenome
sequences seem to accommodate such requirements.
Recently Peng et al. [30] and Saitoh et al. [12] estimated divergence times of Ostariophysi and Cypriniformes, respectively, based on whole mitogenome
sequences. As expected from similarities in the data sets
and priors used in the relaxed-molecular clock Bayesian
analysis, their estimates generally agreed with those of

our study (Table 9). More recently Santini et al. [96]
analyzed divergence times for major fish lineages including those of Otophysi to investigate the effects of fishspecific whole-genome duplication events on the radiations of teleost fishes. Their analyses were based on the
nuclear RAG1 gene sequences across 227 vertebrates
downloaded from the database, and the phylogenetic
relationships were reconstructed by constraining the
monophyly of several groups to reflect generally
accepted phylogenies. They used BEAST [64] to estimate divergence times under a model of uncorrelated
but lognormally distributed rates, with soft upper (=
maximum) bounds assigned to the prior distributions of
45 fossil calibrations using lognormal distributions. Note
that their estimated ages are considerably younger than
those in our study and those reported by Peng et al.
[30] and Saitoh et al. [12] (Table 9) and thus require
explanation.
As expected from the remarkably narrow 95% credible
intervals in the estimated ages for Otocephala (149-153
Ma; Table 9), Santini et al. [96] set both minimum (149
Ma) and maximum (152 Ma) time constraints for the
MRCA of Ostarioclupeomorpha (= Otocephala in this
study). The upper bound (152 Ma) was chosen based on
their strong belief that the MRCA of Otocephala was
unlikely to be older than the oldest stem elopomorph
(true eels and their relatives: †Anaethalion) from the
late Kimmeridgian, Jurassic 152 Ma [42]. Accordingly,

they manipulated three priors of the lognormal distribution (offset = 149; mean = 0.1; SD = 0.6), which allowed
only 5% of the MCMC samples to exceed the soft upper
bound (152 Ma). This approach is called “phylogenetic
bracketing” [97], which obtains not only minimum, but
also maximum constraints on the timing of a branching
event using the dates of the preceding and subsequent
branching episodes [98,99]. Donoghue and Benton [97]
argued that phylogenetic bracketing may be problematic
because it assumes that the branching events above and
below a calibration more reliably capture the timing of
the branching event in question than the estimated date
of the calibration itself. For other clades within the Otocephala, Santini et al. [96] also set relatively narrow time
constraints: Ostariophysi (125-149 Ma), Characiformes
(68-100 Ma), and Siluriformes (73-83.5 Ma). Accordingly, their resulting estimates (Table 9) fit very well
with the fossil records and little chance exists (<5%) that
the MRCA of Otocephala is more than 152 Ma.
We recognize that the approach in Santini et al. [96]
is superior in that it can lend more credence to the fossil record than the standard minimum-age constraints.
Nevertheless, we did not provide upper (maximum)
bounds for these nodes or manipulate two parameters
of the truncated Cauchy distributions (= lognormal distributions in Santini et al. [96]) because insufficient
information exists with which to specify meaningful
prior distributions for most otophysan diversification

sampling.

times. Thus, the remarkable gaps between estimated
ages from the two studies mostly reflect differences in
priors on node ages (as the time constraints) rather than
differences in software (MCMCTREE vs. BEAST) or
data (mitogenomes vs. nuclear genes).
Some recent studies have argued that mitochondrial
genes are likely to yield older node ages than nuclear
genes. For example, Hurley et al. [100] investigated the
relationships and divergence times of the basal actinopterygians (including teleosts) using four nuclear genes
and whole mitogenomes. A relaxed molecular clock
Bayesian analysis based on these two data sets provided
node ages for the most recent common ancestor of teleosts with posterior means of 219 Ma (181-265 Ma) and
246 Ma (206-292 Ma) depending orthologues in the
nuclear genes (only the former estimate shown in their
figure 4) and 296 Ma (268-326 Ma) in the mitochondrial
genome (data taken from their supplementary tables 3
and 7). Despite the overlap between these two results
(95% credible intervals), Hurley et al. [100] concluded
that the mitochondrial estimate of the most recent common ancestor of teleosts was 50-100 million years older
than that of the nuclear genes. Based on this comparison, they further argued that the discrepancy between
their nuclear and mitochondrial estimates may have
been due to evolutionary rate differences between these
two genomes. Note that their nuclear estimation did not
include any species from the osteoglossomorphs (the
putative most primitive teleosts; see Figure 3), which is
likely to result in underestimation of the crown node
age of teleosts with insufficient taxon sampling.
More recently, Brandley et al. [52] investigated intercontinental dispersal of Plestiodon (Eumeces) lizards
based on analysis of a single mitochondrial gene (ND1)
plus seven nuclear genes. They performed a relaxed
molecular clock Bayesian divergence time estimation
using unpartitioned and partitioned data sets across

these genes and found that extreme saturation obscured
the underlying rate of evolution in the mitochondrial
gene, resulting in overestimation of the divergence
times. Such overestimation in the mitochondrial gene
was most pronounced in the unpartitioned data set and
less so in the two partitioned data sets. Brandley et al.
[52] agreed with Phillips [101], who demonstrated that
genes or gene partitions that evolve at extremely high
rates may accumulate so many hidden substitutions,
making it difficult to estimate the underlying process
that created the data. Although their arguments are convincing, comparisons made by Brandley et al. [52] were
based on a single mitochondrial gene, including third
codon positions. We used whole mitochondrial genomes
with various substitution rates across genes [102],
excluded quickly saturated third codon positions
entirely, and partitioned the data sets.
Also the estimated ages may be too old simply
because of the entire absence of a fossil record [100].
The absence of fossils, however, should not be taken as
evidence of absence, as discussed extensively by Diogo
[41]. In an article on the early radiation of teleosts,
Arratia [42] stated “... we know almost nothing concerning the fossil record of most otophysans, of most living
perciforms, atheriniforms, etc.” Thus, to assume a lack
of otophysan fossil record during the Mesozoic is natural if the group existed as stem groups during this
period.
As Brown et al. [72] convincingly argued, although
ample room for improvement exists on both sides of the
“rock-clock” divide (e.g., accounting for ghost lineages in
the fossil record and developing more realistic models of
rate evolution for molecular genetic sequences), the consistent and conspicuous disagreement between these two
sources of data more likely reflects a genuine difference
between estimated ages of 1) stem group origins and 2)
crown group morphological diversification, respectively.

Comments on trans-Atlantic clades

History of diversification

Although this study was not intended to address questions regarding historical biogeography of the otophysans, divergence times of some of the transcontinental
sister group relationships, particularly those between
Africa and South America in Characiformes and Siluriformes, warrant brief comments regarding their origins.
Based on a hypothesis presented by Backup (unpublished thesis [103]), Lundberg [37] examined the implications of applying a strict vicariance scenario to the
three transcontinental sister group pairs in Characiformes and noted that most of the diversification among
characiforms would have occurred prior to the continental breakup (i.e., on Gondwana). Our timetree corroborates this hypothesis because all of our divergence
time estimates of the three transcontinental pairs
(Citharinoidei vs. Characoidei = 220 Ma; two alestids
Micralestes + Phenacogrammus vs. Hydrolycus = 162
Ma; Hepsetus vs. Hoplias = 160 Ma) fall well before the
Gondwanan separation (100-120 Ma) [104]. Note, however, that recent discoveries of marine or brackish characiforms (Santanichthys [94] and Sorbinicharax [105])
from the Cretaceous challenge such a simple vicariance
hypothesis [106].
Recently Lundberg et al. [107] examined the relationships of a highly distinct freshwater catfish, Lacantunia
enigmatica (Lacantuniidae) from Chipas, Mexico, and
found that Lacantunia was derived from within a multifamily clade of African freshwater catfishes ("Big
Africa” in Sullivan et al. [21]; see Figures 3, 6). Based
on a maximum-age constraint of 144 Ma for the stem
of the siluriform lineage (= siluriform + gymnotiform
node) and seven additional minimum-age constraints
for the internal nodes, they estimated the divergence
time of Lacantunia using a relaxed-molecular clock
method implemented in MULTIDIVTIME [69] and r8s
[108]. The resulting divergence estimates ranged from
83 to 87 Ma depending on the partitioning schemes
with 95% credible intervals of 75-94 Ma. These ages
fall after the separation of Africa and South America,
and Lundberg et al. [107] proposed a new scenario
based on an ancient intercontinental passage for
explaining disjunct distributions of relictually endemic
Lacantunia and its African sister clade. Also note that
they acknowledge that their choice of 144 Ma as the
maximum-age constraint is arbitrary, but conservatively informed by the fossil record of actinopterygians.
Although we did not include Lacantunia in our analyses, the onset of diversification of the Big African
clade is estimated to be 129 Ma (113-144 Ma) and
divergence of Lacantunia from its stem should be
much older. Thus our estimated ages did not require
an ancient intercontinental passage as hypothesized by
Lundberg et al. [107].

ML reconstruction of the ancestral habitats on the
timetree suggests that a shift from character state 0
(saltwater) to 1 (freshwater) occurred between the
crown node of Ostariophysi (P 0 = 0.859; P 1 = 0.142)
and that of Otophysi (P 0 = 0.055; P 1 = 0.945), corresponding to the end-Permian (263-249 Ma) (Figure 6).
Moreover, a similar habitat shift was also recovered in
Gonorynchiformes, a sister clade of Otophysi (Figure 6).
Based on these ancestral habitat reconstructions and
the divergence time estimates with reference to Earth’s
history, we identified the following five global turning
points in the history of otophysan diversification. Note,
however, that the true ancestral habitats and dynamics
of diversification cannot be inferred from time-calibrated phylogenies of the extant lineages alone [109];
one need to include the fossil record to fully understand the ancestral habitats and diversity dynamics of
the otophysans.
First, the common ancestor of Otophysi presumably
entered freshwater around 263-249 Ma. This period corresponds to the end-Permian when the largest mass
extinction in Earth’s history occurred, wiping out 96% of
all species [110]. The end-Permian mass extinction has
been associated with a massive release of carbon gases
into the atmosphere, causing a global greenhouse effect
and abrupt climate warming [111]. During the same
time, the oceans are believed to have become anoxic
worldwide [112,113] and to have contained free hydrogen sulfide [114]. These environmental perturbations
greatly altered the marine ecosystems [115] and may
have driven fish extinctions. Note that freshwater contains much higher levels of dissolved oxygen than saltwater for a given atmospheric concentration, and this
difference can affect the biology of the organisms [116].
The possible habitat shift (from salt- to freshwater) in
the common ancestor of Otophysi should have a causal
relationship with the survival of this lineage across the
end-Permian. To our knowledge, however, no comparable examples of habitat shift in other groups of organisms exist that independently support this evolutionary
scenario.
Second, the five major otophysan lineages
(corresponding to common ancestors of the presentday orders or suborders) have successively originated
from an ancestral lineage of the otophysans in a short
time window during the Triassic (251-200 Ma).
During this period all continents remained united as
the supercontinent Pangaea, with a climate characterized by globally warm temperatures, extreme seasonality, and high aridity over much of the inland region
[117]. However, the climate was more moderate
around the edges of the supercontinent. The regions
around Pangaea had sufficient rainfall to produce

Nakatani et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:177
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/177

vigorous forests along riverbanks [118], which possibly
facilitated stepwise divergences of the five lineages on
Pangaea. Note that the Pangaea was cut almost in half
along the east-west axis by a huge embayment called
the Tethys Seaway (Figure 6). Over time, as the Tethys
Seaway expanded, it may have led to the first vicariant
divergence between the common ancestors of Cypriniformes and Characiphysi as suggested by Saitoh et al.
[4,12].
Third, these five major otophysan lineages survived
the end-Triassic mass extinction, which was one of the
five largest extinctions in Earth’s history in which 80%
of all species became extinct [117]. Widespread
magmatic activity of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) has been suggested to have caused this
catastrophic event, and repeated release of SO 2 gas,
heavy metal emissions, and darkening were the main
environmental stressors [119]. Relatively long stem
branches from the common ancestors of the five major
lineages across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary suggest
profound effects of the mass extinction and associated
environmental perturbations on the patterns of otophysan diversification.
Fourth, extant otophysan lineages began to diversify
in each of the five clades during the Jurassic and
through the early Cretaceous (200-100 Ma) (Figure 6),
providing a framework for the modern otophysan
diversity. The onset of diversification depends on the
clade (193-160 Ma), although all fell in the Jurassic
(200-146 Ma). Note that familial diversification of the
South American gymnotiforms, characoids, and loricaroids was recovered much earlier than that of cypriniforms, citharinoids and siluroids (Figure 6). The
Jurassic was a time of particularly swift change due to
the Pangaean breakup and the resulting development
of new oceans and a gentle tropical climate over the
formerly arid interiors of the supercontinent [118].
Such environmental changes likely yielded numerous
novel habitats, facilitating otophysan diversification
throughout the Mesozoic until about 100 Ma.
Finally these modern otophysan lineages established during the Mesozoic survived the third mass
extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous
(Figure 6). Such “mass survival” of the modern
lineages across the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary
has been noted for birds and mammals based on
molecular evidence [120].
The present timetree suggests a Pangaean origin and
Mesozoic radiations of the modern otophysans. This
evolutionary scenario is in good agreement with recent
biogeographic inferences. For example Diogo [41]
broadly surveyed the higher-level phylogeny, biogeographic distribution, physiology, and ecology of catfishes,
and suggested that these fishes originated at a time

Page 21 of 25

when some Pangaean connections still existed between
Laurasia and Gondwana. In addition, Briggs [33] examined the phylogeny and geographic distribution patterns
of ostariophysan fishes and proposed the Late Jurassic
(160-150 Ma) origins of the cypriniforms and siluriforms, which are highly congruent with the estimated
node ages for the most recent common ancestor of
Cypriniformes (160 Ma) and Siluriformes (180 Ma) in
this study.
Of course the evolutionary scenario presented here
just represents a testable hypothesis and should be
viewed with caution because the fossil record provides
no direct evidence. Although Mesozoic freshwater
deposits are geographically and stratigraphically patchy
and the freshwater fishes from most of these deposits
have not been fully documented across all continents
[121-123], available information suggests that major
components of the freshwater fishes were basal actinopterygians (non-teleost ray-finned fishes), chondrichthyans (sharks, rays, chimaeras) and sarcopterygians
(lungfishes and coelacanths) [121-124], and few freshwater teleosts (e.g., the Late Triassic Jiangilichthys) are
referable to extinct “pholidophoriforms,” phylogenetically located outside the modern teleosts [125]. Moreover the fossil record suggests that the modern
teleostean lineages did not diversify until the Late Jurassic about 150 Ma [125]. Thus, acceptance of the present
evolutionary scenario requires the origin and survival of
the ghost lineage from the Triassic through Late Jurassic
for over 100 million years.

Conclusions
The timetree presented here indicates that survival of
the ancestral lineages through the two consecutive
mass extinctions on Pangaea and subsequent radiations
during the Jurassic and through the early Cretaceous
shaped the modern familial diversity of otophysans.
The Pangaean origin and Mesozoic radiations of the
modern otophysans are consistent with recent arguments based on biogeographic inferences [40,41] and
molecular divergence time estimates [37,40]. No fossil
otophysan, however, has been recorded before the
Albian, the early Cretaceous 100-112 Ma [42], creating
an over 100 million year time span without fossil evidence. This extremely large ghost range partially
reflects a genuine difference between the estimated
ages of stem group origin (molecular divergence time)
and crown group morphological diversification (fossil
divergence time) [72]; the ghost range, however, may
be filled with future discoveries of older fossils that
can be used as more reasonable time constraints as
well as with the development of more realistic models
that accurately capture the divergence rates of molecular sequences.
