Quasispecies-like behavior observed in catalytic
RNA populations evolving in a test tube
Carolina Díaz Arenas, Niles Lehman*

Abstract
Background: During the RNA World, molecular populations were probably very small and highly susceptible to
the force of strong random drift. In conjunction with Muller’s Ratchet, this would have imposed difficulties for the
preservation of the genetic information and the survival of the populations. Mechanisms that allowed these
nascent populations to overcome this problem must have been advantageous.
Results: Using continuous in vitro evolution experimentation with an increased mutation rate imposed by MnCl2, it
was found that clonal 100-molecule populations of ribozymes clearly exhibit certain characteristics of a
quasispecies. This is the first time this has been seen with a catalytic RNA. Extensive genotypic sampling from two
replicate lineages was gathered and phylogenetic networks were constructed to elucidate the structure of the
evolving RNA populations. A common distribution was found in which a mutant sequence was present at high
frequency, surrounded by a cloud of mutant with lower frequencies. This is a typical distribution of quasispecies.
Most of the mutants in these clouds were connected by short Hamming distance values, indicating their close
relatedness.
Conclusions: The quasispecies nature of mutant RNA clouds facilitates the recovery of genotypes under pressure
of being removed from the population by random drift. The empirical populations therefore evolved a genotypic
resiliency despite a high mutation rate by adopting the characteristics of quasispecies, implying that primordial
RNA pools could have used this strategy to avoid extinction.

Background
During the origins and early evolution of life on the
Earth, the contemporary notion of well-delineated species was not yet realized. Instead, the adaptive fate of
populations of naked molecules would have been more
accurately described by the quasispecies model of
mutant distributions, which was introduced in the
1970’s by Eigen [1-3]. Under an RNA World scenario,
the molecules in question were autocatalytically replicating polymers of nucleotides, such as RNA or a chemical
equivalent [4,5].
A quasispecies is basically a steady-state dynamic of
mutant molecules distributed around a parental genotype, the so-called master sequence, which occupies a
central position in the genotypic network space. This
dynamic occurs after a sufficient amount of time at high
mutational rates, such that the progeny of an individual

Oregon, 97207, USA

genotype (the mutant cloud) can be rapidly produced.
Importantly, the target of selection is the genotypic distribution as a whole, not single genotypes. Eigen realized
that simple genetic entities would gain an evolutionary
advantage by a primitive form of group selection in
which replication rate deficiencies could be offset by the
heightened production of new mutant types [1]. Different
genotypes can form mutant clouds of various sizes that
can compete for survivorship during the evolution of the
population. This can generate a fluctuating equilibrium
dynamic as clouds of mutants are replaced by other ones
at the interplay of selection and random drift [6].
Although the quasispecies concept was originally
intended as a description of molecular replicators cooperating and competing for survival prior to their historical encapsulation in membranes that inexorably linked
genotype with phenotype [5,7], it soon was argued that
many viral populations evolved with the same dynamic.
The first empirical demonstration of quasispecies behavior was produced in 1978 with the Qb phage [8]. Since

then many viral populations have been described as
evolving as quasispecies collectives under mutationselection balance [9-15], although this interpretation has
been debated in the case of viruses [7,16]. Moreover,
many experiments, particularly by Biebricher and coworkers, have clearly highlighted the power of the quasispecies concept to describe the evolutionary progress
of naked RNA molecules in the test tube as they are
replicated by error-prone protein polymerases [17-19].
Such experiments confirm some of the key predictions
of quasispecies dynamics as outlined by Eigen [5,7]: a
cloud of neutral mutations exists that surround a central
genotype, selection operates on this cloud as a whole, in
small and error-prone populations many specific
mutants occur reproducibly (recur), and the greatest
amount of genotypic diversity exists just below an error
threshold above which information decays into chaos.
To date however, the use of a catalytic RNA in a system capable of forming quasispecies has not been
reported. Currently available data are restricted to genomic or genome-fragment RNAs that can carry genetic
information but not perform a catalytic function. The
aim of the current work is to extend the quasispecies
concept back at least as far as to a system in which the
catalytic function of an RNA molecule is integral to its
own replication process, even if the actual polymerization of nucleotides is carried out by an exogenous polymerase. Here, the continuous evolution (CE) in vitro
evolution [20] of class I ligase ribozymes is used to create an evolving RNA population that can be tracked
over hundreds of generations in a very short time frame.
This system has previously been shown to exhibit mutational meltdown [21] of small populations when the
mutation rate is limited by the intrinsic error rate of
viral polymerases [22]. Now, with the error rate greatly
enhanced with the addition of a chemical mutagen
(manganese (II) ion) such that prebiotic conditions are
better simulated, it is shown that ribozyme populations
do indeed display quasispecies-like dynamics while evolving in a test tube.

were the same as in earlier experiments [22,25,26], with
the exception that MnCl2 was added to the reaction vessel at a final concentration of 40 μM to increase the
mutational rate. The in vitro per nucleotide error rate of
MMLV-RT has been estimated at about 1/30,000 [27],
but Mn2+ ions lower the substrate specificity of RNAand DNA-dependent DNA polymerases both in vivo
and in vitro, resulting in a 6-30-fold higher error rate
[28-30]. All four lineages (termed 6E, 6H, 6K, and 6L)
were carried out for 50 bursts without a sign of population decay via Muller’s Ratchet, and thus a mutational
meltdown was never observed [Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure S1]. These results were unlike those of
previous data obtained in the absence of MnCl 2 , in
which a meltdown was observed at an average of 24.3
bursts [22]. In fact, the data collected here were directly
compared to a more extended analysis of one lineage
from the previous study (termed 3D) that actually did
survive to burst 50 [22].
Genotypic characterization

To investigate the cause of the extended time to extinction, a preliminary inspection of the populational genetic
variability using RFLP was performed. In general, the
cDNA in a population at any burst can be amplified via
PCR and then genotyped by either RFLP or nucleotide
sequence analysis. The fixation, or nearly so, of mutant
forms was evidenced in all the lineages at selected
bursts. Based on RFLP assays [Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure S2] two lineages (6H and 6L) were
selected for a more extensive characterization of the
genotypes present in the populations. Genotypes from
three or four bursts, respectively, in lineages 6H and 6L
(Figure 1B) were cloned and sequenced exhaustively
enough to gather a representative sample of the population diversity. In addition, two bursts from the smallest
surviving lineage from the previous study [22] without
added MgCl2 (the 600-molecule lineage 3D) were genotyped for comparison.
Network analysis

Results
CE experiments

Four clonal 100-molecule populations of the RNA class
I ligase ribozyme B16-19 (Figure 1A) were each evolved
independently using the CE system. The CE protocol is
a means to induce the rapid evolution of ligase ribozymes using Moloney Murine Leukaemia Virus Reverse
Transcriptase (MMLV-RT) and T7 RNA polymerase to
sustain RNA populations through sequential serial transfers [20,23,24]. Each serial transfer involves roughly
three cycles of amplification that produces a rapid proliferation of RNA molecules, and hence is termed
“burst” in this paper. The experimental conditions used

Alignment of the nucleotide sequencing data for
lineages 6H and 6L showed a trend in the population
dynamics in which a majority of the clones have the
same genotype, while a minority have slightly different
ones. This observation was the first clue that quasispecies behavior may be present in these ligase populations.
Phylogenetic networks were drawn (Figures 2 and 3) to
find the genetic relationships among the mutants in
both lineages, and hence the structures of each putative
quasispecies [15]. The structures of these networks
show a dynamic characterized by a dominant and centered sequence that is present at a high frequency,
around which are located other, less frequent mutant

Figure 1 Ligase secondary structure and bursts sampled from two lineages of continuous in vitro evolution. Two lineages were evolved
from a homogeneous population of 100 molecules of B16-19 ligase ribozyme (A). The secondary structure of the B16-19 ribozyme is shown in
orange, in which the primer binding site for reverse transcription (3’ end) and the 5’ end of the promoter for forward transcription (5’ end)
during CE are denoted by solid rectangles. The ribozyme effects the ligation of an external substrate oligomer (black lowercase letters) that
contains the T7 RNA transcriptase promoter sequence, needed for CE, to its own 5’ end. The ligase ribozyme catalyzes the attack of the 3’hydroxyl group of the substrate onto the 5’-a-phosphate of the ribozyme (dashed arrow). Mutations that occurred during CE lineage that
produced new quasispecies centered around the master sequences are shown, following the color scheme used throughout this paper: MS1
(purple), MS2 (blue), and MS3 (green). All evolved master sequences contain the U62A mutation. Genotypic samples of ligases were taken at
various serial transfers in both lineages (B). The lineages were started from a homogeneous population indicated by orange. As time passes,
mutated forms arise and accumulate in the population generating an increased diversity, indicated by white. Based on RFLP data [Additional file
1: Supplemental Figure S1] the bursts selected for cloning and sequencing are indicated by small arrows: 5, 35 and 50 in lineage 6H; and 22, 23,
39 and 42 in lineage 6L.

sequences. This population structure is indeed characteristic of a quasispecies, in which the dominant
sequence is called the “master sequence” and the surrounding mutants form the mutant cloud [2,3]. These
quasispecies are characterized by a relatively close
connection among the mutants as indicated by the
Hamming distances calculated within bursts (mean =

1.40; mode = 1; min = 1; max = 18) based on the network diagrams (Figures 2 and 3; Table 1). The close
connectivity between these mutants is suggestive of a
mutational resiliency in the population that is a plausible cause of their observed extended persistence times;
they did not go extinct prior to burst 50 unlike all the
100-molecule lineages examined previously [22].

Figure 2 The quasispecies formed during the evolution of lineage 6H. Networks among genotypes were constructed using Network
v. 4.5.1.0. Different clouds can be observed in each burst evaluated: (A) burst 5; (B) burst 35; and (C) burst 50. Additionally, a consolidated
alignment of all sequences in the lineage shows a different network outcome (d). Spheres represent mutants present at different frequencies,
denoted by the length of the radius. The color of the sphere is different than yellow if the mutant persists through bursts or recur in a different
lineage. The colors are maintained in all the networks drawn. The distance between spheres is representative of the Hamming distance between
the sequences. The red spheres are calculated median vectors that represent non-sampled or predicted ancestral individuals [64]. The name of
the master sequences in each burst is given as follows: (A) wildtype = B16-19 ligase ribozyme; (B) MS1; and (C) MS2, according to their order of
appearance.

continuation of the numbering in lineage A. Note that the genotype of the MS3 appeared in the cloud A35 at low frequency, and that MS1 and
MS2 are also recurrent from lineage 6H. Spheres represent mutants present at different frequencies denoted by their radii. The genetic
relationships between the mutants and the MS are given by their Hamming distances. Only mutants that persist through various bursts or
lineages are colored different than yellow, and the color is preserved throughout all the networks. Red spheres are calculated median vectors
that represent either ancestral sequences or extant sequences not sampled. A different network outcome is formed from a consolidated
alignment of all the sequences in the lineage (E).

Key: Lineage 3D is from a previous study [22], while lineages 6H and 6L are from this study. The master sequence (MS) names are given by order of appearance,
simply 1, 2, etc., except in the case of the wildtype (wt), B16-19. The frequency of the MS, the total number of sequences sampled, and the number of unique
genotypes was calculated by the Network software, and the Shannon Diversity Index values were calculated using the formula given in the text.

For comparison, 33 and 48 clones, respectively, from
bursts 10 and 50 of the smallest lineage (3D, ref. [22])
that survived in the absence of added MnCl2 were genotyped. Unlike lineages 6H and 6L, the network diagrams
of these bursts failed to exhibit a dominant master
sequence (Figure 4). Instead, there appeared to be a
greater number of less-common genotypes competing
for existence, as would be expected under more typical
conditions of directional selection and/or random
genetic drift. In addition to the network diagrams, one
manner in which lineage 3D could be compared to the
quasispecies in lineages 6H and 6L is to enumerate the
frequency of the most common genotype. In lineage 3D
this value did not exceed 42%, while in lineages 6H and

6L this value dropped below 50% only once in seven
cases: in burst 50 of lineage 6H (Table 1), where the
network diagrams indicated that a transition between
one master sequence and another was in progress
(Figure 2C). Also the average Hamming distance within
the 3D and 3L lineages was 5.60, significantly higher
than in 6H or 6L (Table 1; t-test; P < 0.01).
Evolutionary dynamics

The observed clouds also showed that there existed a
fluctuating dynamic in these populations, as the shape of
the clouds – and gross amount of mutant sequences –
changed from one burst to another (Figures 2D and 3E).
These results indicate that each lineage can develop a

Figure 4 The genotypic network formed during the evolution of lineage 3D. Data for this network was obtained by analysis of the smallest
surviving lineage evolved without added MgCl2 [22]. As in lineages 6H and 6L (Figures 2 and 3), different clouds are formed in each burst, but
dominant master species do not appear: (A) burst 10; (B) burst 50. The genotype indicated by the asterisk (*) is the same in both bursts.

different dynamic over the course of 50 bursts. It is
likely that the high mutation rate used, coupled with
the relative stability of a putative quasispecies structure, allows the populations to explore multiple viable
alternatives of sequence space during the course of
their evolutionary history. In lineage 6H, an early time
point (burst 5 out of 50) shows that a quasispecies-like
cloud is already formed (Figure 2A), in which the master sequence is still the “wildtype” B16-19, with a frequency of 76%. This cloud was constructed from a
sample of 102 clones, which contained 16 different
genotypes (Table 1).
The numbers of clones in each burst that needed to be
genotyped by nucleotide sequence analysis in order to
sample the bulk of unique genotypes present in the
population was evaluated by constructing rarefaction
plots. Because between 41-108 clones per burst were genotyped (Table 1), and yet the harmonic mean population
size of these bursts was ~100 individuals and the frequency distributions of genotypes were highly skewed
(see above), these rarefaction analyses indicated that this
sampling was exhaustive enough to capture all but the
rarest of genotypes. The required number of clones to be
inspected was similar when comparing the bursts within
the lineages, but different when comparing the two
lineages [Additional file 1: Supplemental Table S1]. This
result is not surprising, because a quasispecies would be
a fairly stable equilibrium dynamic, and the environmental conditions are nearly constant during the CE experiments. It should be noted that, although the population
size was ostensibly kept constant at 100 molecules
throughout each lineage, the cloning procedure did
involve PCR amplification. Therefore, the sampling of
genotypes from the population is effectively sampling
with replacement of the total diversity. For example, 102
clones from burst 5 of lineage 6H were obtained, but this
did not mean that all individuals were sampled. Nevertheless, the observed sample diversity in this burst was
estimated at 1.49, as measured by Shannon Diversity
Index (H = -Σpi(lnpi) where pi is the frequency of the ith
clone). Deeper examination of the bursts in this lineage
(Figures 2B and 2C) revealed a change in the master
sequence identity, frequency, number of genotypes, and
Shannon diversity values. In general, the quasispecies
formed in each burst presented different identities from
each other, but their characteristics are fairly similar
(Table 1). This similarity is perhaps the result of the fact
that the sequence space available for exploration by the
populations is bounded by a unique starting point; they
are all genotypically identical at the beginning of the evolution experiment. Therefore, the area of sequence space
that can be explored in 50 serial transfers would be relatively short, and the lineages may be not very different in
their diversity values.

Genotypes that are present at a higher frequency in
one burst can become a master sequence at a later
burst. Conversely, a master sequence that, having once
been displaced, was never observed to come back to
high frequency in the population. For example, in lineage 6H, the following transition can be observed in the
master sequence identity and frequency: burst 5, B16-19
(86%); burst 35, MS1 (91%); burst 50, MS2 (48%). This
dynamic of master sequences being displaced by one
another resembles that of clonal interference, in which
advantageous mutants have to compete for resources
and some get displaced [31-33]. A network drawn by
combining the sequences of all bursts inspected in lineage 6H (Figure 2D) shows the fluctuation of the equilibrium dynamic of the quasispecies in its evolutionary
history.
In lineage 6L, four bursts were evaluated (Figure 3).
These specific bursts were chosen because the RFLP
analysis detected genotypic transitions near these time
points [Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure S2]. The
dynamic of the lineage is similar to that of lineage 6H,
in that different quasispecies clouds emerge and evolve
through time. Two successive bursts (#22 and #23;
Figure 1B) reveal that this fluctuation can occur in a
relatively short time (Figures 3A and 3B). Interestingly,
some of the master sequences that appear during this
lineage (Figures 3B, C, and 3D) are the same as were
observed in lineage 6H (Figures 2B and 2C). These
results suggest that some quasispecies may develop a
stronger mutant coupling than others that enables them
to recurrently out-compete other quasispecies present
during the lineages evolution. Similar to the pattern in
lineage 6H, the characteristics of the quasispecies
change over the course of the evolutionary history as
indicated by the master sequence identity, frequency
and number of genotypes, and diversity values calculated
(Table 1). These dynamics of staggered dominant genotypes that fluctuate as the population evolves (Figure
3E) may be a reflection of the interplay of Darwinian
selection and random genetic drift acting on the
quasispecies.
Other than the genotype used to seed these experiments (B16-19 = the “wildtype”), the genotypes that
appeared in lineages 6H and 6L were not identical to
the dominant genotypes that appeared in lineages
evolved without added mutational pressure [22]. Some
specific mutations, such as the U62A “insurance” mutation [22], did appear recurrently in the quasispecies in
lineages 6H and 6L, but the composite genotypes seen
in this study were not those observed previously. In particular, the “immunity” mutation (a change from
CUGAACCUUA to AAUCG at positions 123-132),
which conferred resistance to mutational meltdown in
small population sizes in the absence of MnCl2, was not

Díaz Arenas and Lehman BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:80

changes in the master sequence transitions are seventeen
and one (Figure 6, inset). The Hamming distance values
are generally low (in the range of tens), eighteen being
the maximum value. The distance between the two most
recurrent master sequences is actually only one, and
these master sequences (MS1 and MS2) are the most
representative in time and sequence space (54% frequency out of the total). The Hamming distance values,
in addition to the high frequency of recurrent mutations,
support the idea of a form of mutational robustness
[34-36] evolving in the system through a quasispecies
behavior in ligase populations evolved in vitro, although a
formal test of this will require a comparison of fitness
values.

Discussion
“What is a quasispecies?” is the exact title of at least two
papers [37,38]. At times this phenomenon has clearly
been difficult to detect and apply to real populations
with absolute certainty. However the defining characteristics of a quasispecies, as described by Eigen, unequivocally include a spectrum of closely related genotypes
and a population that is struggling to survive under a
relatively high error rate. These features seem to apply
to primordial collections of RNA near the origins of life,

seen in the current study, although short insertions,
deletions, and rearrangements were common in the last
10-12 nt at the 3’ end of the ligase (Figure 1), and specific mutations in this region appeared in more than one
quasispecies. Recurrence of mutations is actually a predicted characteristic of quasispecies [5], thus providing
additional support for this interpretation of these data.
In general, from all the networks drawn, it was
observed that the number of mutations that appeared in
more than one burst and/or lineage constituted 61% of
the total number of sequences explored, and the great
majority of these mutants became part of master
sequences during the lineages’ evolutionary history
(green, purple and blue spheres in the quasispecies networks of Figures 2 and 3). The fact that most of the
mutants that have evolved in these lineages were able to
persist in time could be a consequence of the mutational
resiliency that evolved owing to the short Hamming distance values (Figure 5). Most of these recurrent mutations belonged within the master sequences (Figure 6). In
lineage 6H, the initial change in master sequences from
B16-19 to MS1 implies ten changes, and the further
change from MS1 to MS2 implies one change (Figure 6,
inset). Similarly, in lineage 6L, the initial change from
B16-19 to MS3 implies sixteen changes, but further

figures. The x-axis corresponds to the Hamming distances calculated between each mutant type and the sequence of the MS2, and the y-axis

Note that overall, the most frequent mutants have a Hamming distance of one compared to MS2, and most of them constitute the MS1 (127
out of 170). The groups with large Hamming distance values are B16-19, used to start the experiment (and once replaced did not come back),
and MS3 (the least recurrent of all the MS). The majority of the mutant sequences that have appeared at one burst have recurred at another
burst (61%), mainly as a master sequence.

and thus prompted the current study. Here, clonal 100molecule populations of B16-19 ligase ribozymes were
evolved using the continuous in vitro evolution (CE)
method [20] and the relatively error-prone MMLV-RT.
In particular, MnCl2 was added to the reaction vessel to
increase the error rate of protein enzymes. Populations
evolved under these conditions did not show a shortened extinction time, as was observed previously when
mutational meltdown conditions prevailed under only a
weak mutational pressure of no added MnCl2 [22]. The
data suggest that this is a consequence of the advent of
quasispecies in these ribozyme populations.
Quasispecies behavior has never before been demonstrated during in vitro evolution experiments with catalytic RNA. Other in vitro experiments with ribozymes
have shown either convergence on a phenotype or
recurrence of a genotype or motif, but not the type of
dynamic of quasispecies that we are documenting here.
For example, Yingfu Li and colleagues studied how the
composition of a population of RNA-cleaving DNAzymes changed over time in response to selective pressures acting on the phenotype [39,40]. Similar to the
findings reported here, they found a dynamic fluctuation
in the structure of the population. Many sequence
classes peaked in frequency at different rounds of selection, but in this case, one class appeared to consistently
maintain a high frequency. It will be interesting to
explore the population structure that these DNAzymes
would adopt if the mutation rate of the replication were
increased. Perhaps mutational coupling may arise in
these molecular populations as well. Another classic

study of interest was the evolution of the RNA variant
V2 of the Qb virus performed by Orgel and co-workers
[41]. In this case, the mutagen ethidium bromide
(EthBr) was added to the reaction vessel during the
serial transfers. RNAs resistant to EthBr evolved and
adapted to increasing drug concentrations. However in
this case, in contrast to the CE/Mn 2+ mutagenesis
experiments presented here, the mutagen has a direct
effect on the RNA structure, and therefore selection
favored variants that mutated away the EthBr-binding
sites, and a single “winner” emerged. Examples of
experiments in which there is a convergent to a relatively more efficient solution for the population have
been reviewed [23,42-45]. Other in vitro evolution studies have been initiated from pools of limited diversity
but in which a recurrent solution would appear upon
independent trials. This was the evolution dynamic that
gave rise to the class I ligase [26], and the group I ribozymes [46], but quasispecies-like behavior was not
adopted by any of those populations.
The current study employed the ribozyme B16-19,
which is highly proficient in catalyzing the ligation reaction necessary for the CE to occur [47,48], and posses an
efficient folding into an active conformation [23,25,26].
These characteristics locate this genotype on the top of a
high fitness peak [23,26]. Thus, the mutation accumulation that occurred during each serial transfer can cause
structural changes in the individuals, which in turn can
further cause a decrease in the mean fitness of the population via Muller’s Ratchet and random drift. The population can then fall into a fitness valley and become extinct.

The addition of Mn 2+ to the reaction vessels increases
the mutation rate of the replication process and consequently it can alter the equilibrium distribution of the
population [6]. Quasispecies behavior sustains this shift
in equilibrium distribution by a mutational coupling,
allowing the population to stay extant in spite of the
strong random drift and the ostensible lack of recombination in the population, as was observed recently in
empirical populations of viroids [13].
The shift in the equilibrium distribution is possible
because of two main reasons, first stated and then
explained.
(1) Catalytic RNA sequences such as ligase ribozymes posses the property of buffering mutations
through epistatic interactions between secondary
structure arrangements [35,49]. These arrangements
strongly stabilize the structure and thus a broader
range of mutations will have a neutrally selective
effect, hence relaxing the error threshold [49,50].
(2) The fitness of each genotype in the population is
normalized with the total number of genotypes in
the system (assuming single locus theory applies).
Thus, the proportional contribution of each genotype to the total fitness decreases as the number of
genotypes increases [51].
The high degeneracy observed in ribozyme genotypeto-phenotype maps insures that the majority of point
mutations are neutral [34,35]. In spite of this, the mutational buffering of secondary structure epistatic interactions can only favor the fitness of the lower class
mutants (e.g., low Hamming distance values). The
genetic load generated in higher-class mutants will likely
disrupt secondary interactions and the stability of the
individual ligases. Oddly enough, an increase in the
mutational rate does not cause a proportional increase
in the genetic load, and therefore the population does
not become extinct at a faster pace. What could be happening in this case is that mutants of lower class emerge
quickly, generating a wide low-mutant class in the early
evolutionary pathway of the population. These mutants
have a short Hamming distances and thus probably
similar fitness values. Wilke [51] observed that the first
couple of replication cycles mostly determine fixation or
extinction for an invading sequence, or perhaps for a
group of close connected sequences, such as the quasispecies mutant cloud. The major contribution to the fixation probability comes from the connectivity matrix of
the local genetic neighborhood of the invading sequence
(or mutant class); sequences farther away on the neutral
network that are poorly connected become relatively
unimportant, and may be drawn out of the population
by genetic drift and mutation selection balance.

Page 10 of 13

The level of connection in the matrix is determined by
the Hamming distance values of the mutants in the network. Genotypes that are closely connected by short
Hamming distances are closely related in the sense that
they can rapidly (e.g., in a few generations) be regenerated from one another in the eventual case of being
removed from the population by random drift. In
contrast, poorly connected genotypes (e.g., only distant
relatives) will have a slow recovery into the population,
if at all. In this scenario, because mutants with short
Hamming distance may have close fitness values, individual sequences are not essential for the survival of the
population, rather the group of close-connected individuals with mutational robustness [13,52,53]. Therefore,
the quasispecies cloud itself is being the target of selection [6] and not the individual sequences. This process
is analogous to the manner in which kin selection operates in animal societies [54,55]. Ribozyme populations
therefore can – by means of indirect reproduction
effects – evolve a mutational robustness [57], a behavior
that empowers selection with an advantage relative to
other evolutionary forces (e.g., the strength that random
drift has in populations of small effective sizes). This
genotypic malleability allows the population to avoid a
mutational meltdown, and stay extant.
These results – of ligase RNA molecules capable of
forming population structures in which cooperation is
more beneficial than competition – suggest that altruistic behavior (e.g., cooperation) is an advantageous feature to ensure survival of populations during the RNA
world [56], when the population size were small, when
the mutational rate was high, and when random genetic
drift had strong effect, conditions that certainly prevailed on the prebiotic Earth [52,58]. Additionally, quasispecies have an organization structure with the
properties proposed by Kaufmann [59] to be necessary
for the origin and preservation of genetic information.
In this structure, the closely connected cloud of the quasispecies can serve as an information-preserving core,
and the distantly surrounding genotypes as ideal targets
for random genetic drift because they are less frequent
and the information loss through them does not negatively impact the survival of population. According to
Kauffman [60], organized systems may have arisen as a
consequence of the property of some elements to establish different levels of connectivity among each other.
The highly interconnected elements can create organizational cores able to preserve the information relevant to
survival of the system (e.g., autocatalytic function). In
contrast, less interconnected elements can serve as a
reservoir of mutations without a detrimental effect on
this information. Thus, during the ancient acellular
times at the biogenesis on the Earth, the assemblage of
information cores, perhaps in the form of quasispecies

clouds, may have provided the necessary route to
increase population sizes, and allow enough time for
information to mature into more sophisticated functions
necessary for a cellular type of life.

taken from the dilution tube and used to seed the next
reaction cycle of the continuous evolution process,
thereby preserving a constant harmonic mean of the
population size [61].

Conclusions
The quasispecies is a population structure typically
formed at high mutation rates that allow the mutants to
stay closely connected and thus be easily regenerated
from one another even if lost from the population
through random genetic drift. This behavior empowers
selection relative to other evolutionary forces. Consequently, information relevant to the survival of the
population can be stored in a close-knit network of
mutants and not in the individuals. It is likely that such
a population structure would have greatly benefited primordial pools of nascent RNA molecules on the early
Earth. Instead of relying on the fortuitous advent of specific self-replicating genotypes, the RNA World would
have the luxury of swarms of quasispecies evolving over
time, buffered against extinction through informational
decay, as theorized by Eigen [1].

Population assessments

Methods
RNA Preparation

B16-19 ligase ribozymes were freshly prepared by transcription of PCR DNA of B16-19 clones obtained in a
previous in vitro evolution experiment [25]. The RNA
transcripts were purified by PAGE. The concentrations
of the RNAs obtained after gel purification were measured by UV spectroscopy at 260 nm. A dilution series
was then performed to obtain the desired concentration
of 100 molecules in the 8.20 μL aliquot used to seed the
evolution experiments.
Continuous in vitro evolution

Ligase ribozyme populations were evolved using the
continuous in vitro evolution methodology [20,25,26,61].
To summarize, 2.03 × 10-8nM B16-19 ligase (100 molecules) were incubated with 64 pmol of the substrate
oligo S-163 (5’-CTTGACGTCAGCCTGGACTAATACGACTCACUAUA-3’ = a DNA/RNA chimera, with ribonucleotides in boldface letters, and the T7 promoter in
italics), 50 pmol of TAS 1.23 primer for reverse transcription (5’-GCTGAGCCTGCGATTGG-3’), 250 units
of MMLV reverse transcriptase (United States Biochemicals, Cleveland), 50 units T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion,
Austin, TX), 5 nmol each dNTP, 50 nmol each rNTP,
25 mM MgCl2, and 40 μM MnCl2, in a reaction buffer
with 50 mM KCl, 30 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine1-propanesulfonic acid (EPPS), pH 8.3. The 25 μL reaction mix was incubated at 37°C for exactly 22 minutes,
at the completion of which the reaction was stopped by
the addition of 981 μL of water. An 8.2 μL aliquot was

(1) The survival of the evolved populations was surveyed
through PCR amplifications of all the bursts used to
seed a reaction cycle. The PCR products were electrophoresed through 2% agarose gels containing ethidium
bromide. Visualization of the gels by trans-illumination
allowed the identification of a correctly band size when
the population remained alive.
(2) Preliminary genetic variability was evaluated by
RFLP using the restriction enzymes employed in the
previous publication [22]. In the populations where genotypic variability was detected, a more extensive genotypic characterization was done, as described in the
following section.
Genotypic characterization

Bursts were chosen for in-depth sequence analysis based
on whether they displayed variability by RFLP and/or on
a general desire to examine early, middle, and later
bursts of 50-burst lineages. In one case (lineage 6L), two
adjacent bursts were analyzed because the RFLP analysis
suggested a rapid genotypic shift at that time. Specific
bursts of the evolving populations with genotypic diversity were cloned using the CloneJet™ PCR Cloning Kit
(Fermentas, Maryland) and E. coli competent cells (Invitrogen, San Diego). Between 60-120 colonies per burst
were chosen completely at random for genotyping. Colony PCR was used to isolate the insert from single
clones and further sequencing was done with BDT v3.1
chemistry. The sequences were aligned with ClustalX
2.0.11 software; the alignments were edited with BioEdit
sequence alignment editor v7.0.9.0 (Tom Hall, Ibis BioSciences, Carlsbad) and the chromatogram viewer
FinchTV v1.4 (Geospiza Inc., Washington).
To estimate if the number of clones sampled in each
selected burst contained all the unique genotypes present in the population, rarefaction plots were constructed. Here, the pool of known genotypes is entered
into the computer and then drawn in a random order
by a computer (using random numbers [62] imported
into Microsoft Excel). Then a plot is made of total
new genotypes found as a function of total number of
genotypes sampled, following the method used in
reference [63]. From averages of these plots, non-linear
curve fitting was performed using Origin Pro v8.0
software (OriginLab Corp, Massachusetts) to give
the expected asymptotes, which are estimates of the
theoretical total number of genotypes present in the
population [64].

Phylogenetic network mapping

For each lineage, all the genetic variants that were
detected were aligned using DNA alignment v1.3.0.1
(Fluxus Technology Ltd.) and plotted together using the
median-joining method [65] implemented in NETWORK v4.5.1.0 software [66].
