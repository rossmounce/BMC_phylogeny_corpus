Analysis of a c0t-1 library enables the targeted
identification of minisatellite and satellite families
in Beta vulgaris

Abstract
Background: Repetitive DNA is a major fraction of eukaryotic genomes and occurs particularly often in plants.
Currently, the sequencing of the sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) genome is under way and knowledge of repetitive DNA
sequences is critical for the genome annotation. We generated a c0t-1 library, representing highly to moderately
repetitive sequences, for the characterization of the major B. vulgaris repeat families. While highly abundant
satellites are well-described, minisatellites are only poorly investigated in plants. Therefore, we focused on the
identification and characterization of these tandemly repeated sequences.
Results: Analysis of 1763 c0t-1 DNA fragments, providing 442 kb sequence data, shows that the satellites pBV and
pEV are the most abundant repeat families in the B. vulgaris genome while other previously described repeats
show lower copy numbers. We isolated 517 novel repetitive sequences and used this fraction for the identification
of minisatellite and novel satellite families. Bioinformatic analysis and Southern hybridization revealed that
minisatellites are moderately to highly amplified in B. vulgaris. FISH showed a dispersed localization along most
chromosomes clustering in arrays of variable size and number with exclusion and depletion in distinct regions.
Conclusion: The c0t-1 library represents major repeat families of the B. vulgaris genome, and analysis of the c0t-1
DNA was proven to be an efficient method for identification of minisatellites. We established, so far, the broadest
analysis of minisatellites in plants and observed their chromosomal localization providing a background for the
annotation of the sugar beet genome and for the understanding of the evolution of minisatellites in plant
genomes.

Background
Repetitive DNA makes up a large proportion of eukaryotic genomes [1]. Major findings in the last few years
show that repetitive DNA is involved in the regulation
of heterochromatin formation, influences gene expression or contributes to epigenetic regulatory processes
[2-7]. Therefore, understanding the role of repetitive
DNA and the characterization of their structure, organization and evolution is essential. A rapid procedure to
identify repetitive DNA is based on c0t DNA isolation
[8], which is an efficient method for the detection of
major repetitive DNA fractions as well as for the identification of novel repetitive sequences in genomes [9].

The c0t DNA isolation is based on the renaturation of
denaturated genomic DNA within a defined period of
time and concentration. The rate at which the fragmented DNA sequences reassociate is proportional to the
copy number in the genome [8] and therefore, c0t DNA
isolated after short reassociation time (e.g. c0t-1) represents the repetitive fraction of a genome. Recently, analyses of c0t DNA were performed in plants e.g. for Zea
mays, Musa acuminata, Sorghum bicolor and Leymus
triticoides [8,10-12].
Satellite DNA consisting of tandemly organized repeating units (monomers) of relatively conserved sequence
motifs is a major class of repetitive DNA. Depending on
monomer size, tandem repeats are subdivided into satellites, minisatellites and microsatellites and tandem
repeats with specific functions such as telomeres and
ribosomal genes. The monomer size of minisatellites

varies between 6 to 100 bp [13] and those of microsatellites between 2 to 5 bp [14]. Most plant satellites have a
monomer length of 160 to 180 bp or 320 to 370 bp [15].
Satellite DNAs are non-coding DNA sequences, which
are predominantly located in subterminal, intercalary and
centromeric regions of plant chromosomes. The majority
of typical plant satellite arrays are several megabases in
size [15]. In contrast, arrays of minisatellites vary in
length from 0.5 kb to several kilobases [13]. Minisatellites
are often G/C-rich and fast evolving [13] and thought to
originate from slippage replication or recombination
between short direct repeats [16] or slipped-strand mispairing replication at non-contiguous repeats [17]. Minisatellites are poorly investigated in plants. So far, only a
few minisatellites were described, for example in Arabidopsis thaliana, O. sativa, Triticum aestivum, Pisum sativum and some other plant species [18-26]. Moreover,
only two minisatellite families were physically mapped on
plant chromosomes using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) [19].
The sequencing of the sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) genome, which is about 758 Mb in size [27] and has been
estimated to contain 63% repetitive sequences [28], is
under way and the first draft of genome sequence is
currently established [29]. Knowledge about repetitive
DNA and their physical localization is essential for the
correct annotation of the sugar beet genome. Therefore,
we detected and classified the repeated DNA fraction of
B. vulgaris using sequence data from cloned c0t-1 DNA
fragments. We focused on the investigation of novel
tandem repeats and characterized nine minisatellite and
three satellite families. Their chromosomal localization
was determined by multicolor FISH and the organization within the genome of B. vulgaris was analyzed by
Southern hybridization.

Results
c0t-1 analysis reveals the most abundant satellite DNA
families of the B. vulgaris genome

In order to analyze the composition of the repetitive
fraction of the B. vulgaris genome, we prepared c 0 t-1
DNA from genomic DNA and generated a library consisting of 1763 clones with an average insert size
between 100 to 600 bp providing in total 442 kb (0.06%
of the genome) sequence data. For the characterization
of the c0 t-1 DNA sequences we performed homology
search against nucleotide sequences and proteins in
public databases and classified all clones based on their
similarity to described repeats, telomere-like motifs,
chloroplast-like sequences as well as novel sequences
lacking any homology (Figure 1). More than half of the
c 0 t-1 fraction (60%) belongs to known repeat classes
including mostly satellites. In order to determine the
individual proportion of each repeat family we applied

BLAST analysis using representative query sequences of
each repeat. We observed that the relative frequency of
repetitive sequence motifs found in the c0t-1 library correlates with its genomic abundance in B. vulgaris: The
most frequently occurring repeat is pBV (32.8%, 579
clones), [EMBL:Z22849], a highly repetitive satellite
family that is amplified in large arrays in centromeric
and pericentromeric regions of all 18 chromosomes
[30,31]. The next repeat in row has been observed in
19.5% of cases (343 clones) and belongs to the highly
abundant satellite family pEV [EMBL:Z22848] that
forms large arrays in intercalary heterochromatin of
each chromosome arm [32]. The c0t-1 DNA library also
enabled the detection of moderately amplified repeats.
Telomere-like motifs of the Arabidopsis-type were
detected in 1.1% (20 clones) while a smaller proportion
of sequences belong to the satellite family pAv34 (0.9%,
16 clones), [EMBL:AJ242669] which is organized in tandem arrays at subtelomeric regions [33]. Only 0.1% (2
clones) belong to the satellite families pHC28 [EMBL:
Z22816] [34] and pSV [EMBL:Z75011] [35], respectively,
which are distributed mostly in intercalary and pericentromeric chromosome regions. Furthermore, microsatellite motifs were found in 1.7% of c0t-1 sequences [36].
Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements
(MITEs) [EMBL:AM231631], derived from the Vulmar
family of mariner transposons [37], were identified in
0.3% (6 clones) of the c0 t-1 sequences, while Vulmar
[EMBL:AJ556159] [38] was detected in a single clone
only. The repeat pRv [EMBL:AM944555] was found in a
relatively low number of c0t-1 sequences (0.4%, 7 clones)
indicating lower abundance than the satellite pBV. pRv
is only amplified within pBV monomers and forms a
complex structure with pBV [31]. Surprisingly, the
homology search enabled the detection of a large
amount of c0t-1 sequences (13.6%) that show similarities
to chloroplast DNA.
The identification of novel repetitive sequences was an
aim of the c0t-1 analysis. Altogether, we identified 29.3%
(517 clones) of the c0t-1 sequences lacking homology to
previously described B. vulgaris repeats. However, to
verify the repetitive character of each sequence motif we
performed BLAST search against available B. vulgaris
sequences. 56582 BAC end sequences (BES) [39], (Holtgräwe and Weisshaar, in preparation) covering 5.2% of
the genome were used for analysis. 360 c0t-1 sequences
showed hits in BES ranging from 11 to 300 while 39
sequences showed more than 300 hits and 118
sequences less than 10 hits. This observation indicates
that many of these yet uncharacterized c0t-1 clones contain sequence motifs that are highly to moderately
amplified in the genome.
We performed an assembly of the 517 uncharacterized
c 0 t-1 clones to generate contigs, which contain

sequences belonging to an individual repeat family. In
total, 37 contigs ranging in size from 149 bp to 1694 bp
(average size 555 bp) were established. The largest contig in size and clone number (1694 bp, 20 sequences)
was used for BLAST search against available sequences.
Analysis of the generated alignment revealed a LTR of a
retrotransposon. The full-length element designated
Cotzilla was classified as an envelope-like Copia LTR
retrotransposon related to sireviruses [40]. The internal
region of Cotzilla showed similarity to 40 sequences of

118 c 0 t-1 clones categorized as retrotransposon-like
(Figure 1C) showing that Cotzilla is the most abundant
retrotransposon within the c0t-1 library. Analysis of a
further contig (1081 bp, 4 clones) resulted in the identification of the LTR of a novel Gypsy retrotransposon
(unpublished) that shows 13 hits within the c0t-1 library.
Three further clones displayed similarities to transposons. The remaining uncharacterized c0t-1 clones (396
sequences) were used for the identification of tandemly
arranged repeats.

Targeted isolation of minisatellites and satellites using the
c0t-1 library

Plant minisatellites do not have typical conserved
sequence motifs, therefore the analysis of c0t DNA is a
useful method for the targeted isolation of minisatellites.
We scanned the 396 clones of the c0t-1 library that show
no similarity to known repeats and detected 35 sequences
that contain tandemly repeated sequences. Based on their
similarity these sequences were grouped into nine minisatellite families and three satellite families. The minisatellites were named according to their order of detection
and the satellites according to conserved internal restriction sites (Table 1). A sequence of each tandem repeat
family was used as query and blasted against available
sequences to identify additional B. vulgaris copies. Alignments of all sequences of each tandem repeat family were
generated and the average monomer size, the G/C-content and the identity values of at least 20 randomly
selected monomers determined (Table 1).
In order to investigate the genomic organization and
abundance of the tandem repeats, Southern hybridizations were carried out. A strong hybridization smear of a
wide molecular weight range was detected in each case
indicating abundance of the minisatellite families in the

genome of B. vulgaris (Figure 2A - G). Distinct single
bands were observed for the minisatellite families
BvMSat10 (Figure 2, H) and BvMSat11 (Figure 2, I).
Because of the short length, recognition sites for restriction enzymes are rare or absent within minisatellite
monomers. Thus, genomic DNA was restricted with 15
different restriction enzymes to identify restriction
enzymes generating mono- and multimers in minisatellite arrays detectable by Southern hybridization. Figure 2
illustrates the probing of genomic DNA after restriction
with the 5 restriction enzymes generating most ladderlike patterns in minisatellite and satellite arrays. A typical
ladder-like pattern is detectable for BvMSat04 (Figure
2C, lane 1) and BvMSat03 (Figure 2B, lane 2). Multiple
restriction fragments were observed after hybridization of
BvMSat08 (Figure 2F). The tandem organization of the
minisatellites lacking restriction sites was confirmed by
sequence analysis or PCR (not shown). Typical ladderlike patterns were generated for each satellite family. For
example, the tandem organization was verified for the
FokI satellite, AluI satellite and HinfI satellite after
restriction with AluI (Figure 2, J-L, lane 3,).
To investigate the DNA methylation of the tandem
repeats in CCGG motifs, genomic DNA was digested

Figure 2 Southern hybridization of genomic B. vulgaris DNA with probes of tandem repeats identified in the c0 t-1 library. Genomic
DNA was restricted with NdeI (1), BsmAI (2), AluI (3), HpaII (4) and MspI (5) and hybridized with BvMSat01 (A), BvMSat03 (B), BvMSat04 (C),
BvMSat05 (D), BvMSat07 (E), BvMSat08 (F), BvMSat09 (G), BvMSat10 (H), BvMSat11 (I) and the FokI-satellite (J), AluI-satellite (K) and HinfI-satellite (L).

with methylation sensitive isoschizomeres HpaII and
MspI. HpaII only cuts CCGG, whereas MspI cuts CCGG
and C met CGG [41]. We detected very large DNA fragments generated by restriction with HpaII and MspI,
which were not resolved by conventional gel electrophoresis indicating reduced restriction of DNA in most minisatellites and adjacent regions (Figure 2, A - I, lane 4 and
5). The DNA methylation of CCGG motifs in AluI and
HinfI satellite arrays was observed by the hybridization to
very large DNA-fragments (Figure 2, K - L, lane 4 and 5).
However, the presence of several small DNA fragments
and signals of multimers after restriction with MspI (Figure 2J, lane 5) indicates no CNG methylation of some
FokI satellite arrays (Figure 2, J, lane 5).
Physical mapping of tandemly repeated c0t-1 clones using
FISH

The physical distribution of the minisatellite and satellite families on mitotic metaphase chromosomes of B.
vulgaris was investigated by fluorescent in situ

hybridization (FISH) (Figure 3). For the visualization of
chromosome morphology and structure, metaphase
nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue fluorescence in Figure 3). Euchromatin is detectable by less DAPI staining,
while stronger intensity indicates heterochromatic
regions such as centromeres and pericentromeres. In
order to identify chromosome pair 1, metaphase chromosomes were hybridized with 18S-5.8S-25S-rRNA
genes (green signals in Figure 3) that show strong signals in terminal regions on one pair of chromosomes.
The still decondensed rDNA is displaced or disrupted in
some metaphases resulting in additional signals (e.g. Figure 3, K and 3J).
Using minisatellites as probes, similarities in the chromosome distribution patterns were preferentially
observed in the intercalary heterochromatin and for
some minisatellites in terminal regions as dispersed signals. Only weak signals were detectable in centromeric
or pericentromeric regions. Different chromosomes

Figure 3 Physical mapping of tandem repeats on mitotic metaphase chromosomes and interphase nuclei of B. vulgaris using FISH.
Blue fluorescence (DAPI stained DNA) shows the morphology of chromosomes. Red signals show chromosomal localization of the tandem
repeats and green signals show position of 18S-5.8S-25S rRNA genes on the chromosomes. Hybridization with the minisatellites BvMSat01 (A),
BvMSat03 (B), BvMSat04 (C), BvMSat05 (D), BvMSat07 (E), BvMSat08 (F), BvMSat09 (G), BvMSat10 (H), BvMSat11 (I) on mitotic metaphases and
probes of the FokI-satellite (J), the AluI-satellite (K) and the HinfI-satellite (L) on mitotic metaphases and interphase nuclei reveals characteristic
chromosomal distribution patterns.

Zakrzewski et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:8

show a variation in signal strength and, hence, in copy
numbers or expansion of minisatellite arrays (e.g. Figure
3, A-C, F and 3G). While some chromosomes show
stronger banding patterns indicating larger arrays or
clustering of multiple arrays, on other chromosomes
weak or no signals were revealed (e.g. Figure 3, F and
3G), which shows that minisatellite arrays are often
small in size. The detection of signals on both chromatids of many chromosomes verifies the hybridization
pattern.
Physical mapping using probes of the minisatellite
families BvMSat08 and BvMSat09 shows particular
hybridization patterns enabling the discrimination of B.
vulgaris chromosomes (Figure 3, F and 3G). A peculiar
hybridization pattern was observed for BvMSat08, which
shows massive amplification of signals in the intercalary
heterochromatin (Figure 3, F), which are localized on
one chromosome arm of a single chromosome pair indicating very large arrays of multiple BvMSat08 copies or
clustering of arrays. Four chromosomes show only
reduced signals indicating a lower number of BvMSat08
arrays on these chromosomes. The minisatellite
BvMSat09 shows massive accumulation of clusters in
the intercalary heterochromatin on twelve chromosomes
(Figure 3, G). Six of them are identifiable by blocks on
both chromosome arms, whereas the other chromosomes are characterized by blocks on one chromosome
arm only.
For the physical mapping of satellites identified in the
c0t-1 library we hybridized metaphase chromosomes and
also interphase nuclei, which enable the detection of signals at higher resolution (Figure 3, J-L). The FokI-satellite shows a co-localization with DAPI-positive
intercalary heterochromatin (Figure 3, J). However, the
signals are not uniformly distributed and differ in signal
strength. Hybridization was also detected at terminal
euchromatic chromosome regions, consistent with the
FokI-satellite hybridization pattern in interphase nuclei
in low DAPI-stained euchromatic regions (arrows in
Figure 3, J).
Strong clustering of AluI-satellite arrays was observed
in the intercalary heterochromatin on four chromosomes, while eight chromosomes show a weaker hybridization pattern (Figure 3, K). The remaining six
chromosomes show very weak signals indicating that
AluI-satellites are also present in low copy numbers.
The hybridization pattern in interphase nuclei shows
that most AluI-satellite signals are localized within heterochromatic chromosome regions adjacent to euchromatic regions.
Hybridization with probes of the HinfI-satellite shows
a different pattern. Signals of the HinfI-satellite are
mostly localized in terminal chromosome regions: twelve
chromosomes show hybridization on both chromosome

Page 7 of 14

arms, while signals only on one chromosome arm are
detectable on the remaining six chromosomes (Figure 3,
L). Hybridization on interphase nuclei revealed the preferred distribution of HinfI-satellites in euchromatic
regions (arrows in Figure 3, L), while only reduced signals are notable in heterochromatic blocks.
Minisatellite BvMSat07 consists of a complex microsatellite
array

Among the c0t-1 sequences, we identified an array of a
microsatellite motif with the consensus sequence
GATCA. Within several c 0 t-1 sequences, three short
imperfect repeats (GAAAA, AATAA and GTTCA) were
interspersed within arrays of GATCA monomers. In
order to examine whether this interspersion is conserved, we analyzed B. vulgaris sequences possessing
GATCA-microsatellite arrays and detected that the minisatellite BvMSat07 is derived from the GATCA-microsatellite. A typical BvMSat07 monomer, which is 30 bp
in size, consists of one GAAAA, one AATAA, one
GTTCA motif conserved in this order and three adjacent GATCA monomers, respectively (Figure 4). The
analysis of 20 randomly selected minisatellite BvMSat07
monomers revealed that most monomers show an identical arrangement of these short subrepeats and that
these monomers share a similarity of 90% to 100%.
Head to head junction is a typical characteristic of
BvMSat05 arrays

The 21 bp minisatellite BvMSat05 varies considerably in
nucleotide composition. Sequence identity analysis of
450 monomers originating from c 0 t-1 and BAC end
sequences revealed that monomers show identities
between 38% and 100%.
BvMSat05 shows a particular genomic organization: In
addition to the head to tail organization, a head to head
junction is detectable within multiple BvMSat05 arrays
(Figure 5). Identity values between 35% and 100% of the
monomers within the inverted arrangement of the two
arrays are similar to the values of head to tail monomers. The tandem arrays of the head to head junction
are flanked one-sided by the conserved sequence motif
GTCGTCCGACCAAAGATTATGGTCGGACGAGTCCGACACAATACGTTCTCT, which is 50 bp in
size and shows identity of 86% to 100% (Figure 5). Interestingly, this sequence comprises two palindromic
motifs (TCGTCCGACCAAAGATTATGGTCGGACGA
and GTCGGACGAGTCCGAC) (arrows in Figure 5).

Discussion
The aim of this study was the characterization of the
repetitive fraction of the B. vulgaris genome. We generated and analyzed 1763 highly and moderately repetitive
sequences from a c 0 t-1 DNA library. Our results
revealed that the majority of sequences in the c 0 t-1
library are copies of the satellite families pBV [30] and

Figure 4 BvMSat07 is composed of microsatellite complex repeats. 30 bp monomers of BvMSat07 are typically composed of degenerated
and conserved GATCA-motifs (as example an array of the BAC end sequence FN424407 is shown).

pEV [32] while other known repeats of the B. vulgaris
genome are underrepresented. According to the copy
numbers within the c0t-1 library, the satellite pBV is the
most abundant satellite family in the genome of B. vulgaris followed by the pEV satellite family. This observation is consistent with the prediction that the number of
copies of a repeat family in c0t DNA correlates with its
abundance in the genome [8].
So far, c0t DNA isolation has been performed in several plant genomes. c 0 t DNA libraries representing

highly repetitive sequences were generated from genomic DNA of S. bicolor, M. acuminata and L. triticoides
[8,11,12] while moderately repetitive DNA fractions
were isolated from S. bicolor and Z. mays [8,10]. The c0t
analysis enabled the identification of novel repeats, as
well as the detection of most abundant repeat classes
within a plant genome. c0t-1 DNA analysis performed in
the L. triticoides genome revealed a highly abundant
satellite family [12] which is similar to the observation
that most c0t-1 clones of B. vulgaris belong to satellite

conserved 50 bp motif, which comprises two palindromic sequences (double arrows). Identity values are displayed in percent.

DNA. In contrast, the most abundant repeats detected
in the c0 t libraries of S. bicolor, M. acuminata and Z.
mays belong to retrotransposons or retrotransposonderived sequences. No significant number of tandemly
repeated sequences (except ribosomal genes in the M.
acuminata and S. bicolor genome) has been observed
indicating that retrotransposons constitute the main
repetitive fraction in these genomes [8,10,11].
The detection of the relatively low number of Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) in
the c0t library of B. vulgaris is in contrast to the large
number of MITEs that has been described [37] and indicates a possible bias during library construction. A possible reason for the low frequency of MITEs in c 0 t-1
DNA might be related to the intramolecule renaturation
via terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) of single stranded
sequences containing MITEs. TIRs of MITEs in B. vulgaris are relatively short [37] and c0t clones containing
inserts less than 50 bp have been excluded, hence, short
MITE sequences have been escaped from analysis.
A possible explanation for the differences in the number of organelle-derived sequences within c0t libraries
might be related to plastid and mitochondrial DNA
which was isolated together with nuclear DNA. Hribová
et al. (2007) and Yuan et al. (2003) isolated the c0t-0.05
DNA and the c0t-100 fraction from the M. acuminata
and Z. mays genome, respectively, using a similar
approach as in this study [10,11]. The proportion of
chloroplast DNA in the c 0 t-0.05 DNA fraction of M.
acuminata is 4.2%, which is approximately a third compared to the c0t-1 DNA fraction of B. vulgaris and the
proportion of organelle-derived DNA in the c 0 t-100
fraction of Z. mays is 1.7% which is much lower as in
c0t-1 DNA fraction of B. vulgaris. No chloroplast DNA
was detectable in the highly repetitive c0t fraction of S.
bicolor while 10% chloroplast-derived sequences have
been observed in the moderate c0t fraction of S. bicolor
[8,10,11]. Another possible scenario explaining these differences is that chloroplast DNA was integrated into
nuclear DNA and consequently c 0 t sequences with
homology to chloroplast DNA might also originate from
the nucleus. Chloroplast DNA can be found interspersed
into nuclear DNA in many plant species including B.
vulgaris [42-44]. Moreover, it has been assumed that
chloroplast DNA incorporation into the nucleus is a frequent evolutionary event [44]. However, it is very likely
that the B. vulgaris c0t-1 clones containing chloroplast
sequences originate from contamination of the genomic
DNA used for reassociation.
Macas et al. (2007) performed an analysis of genomic
sequence data originating from a single 454-sequencing
run of the Pisum sativum genome to reconstruct the
major repeat fraction and identified retroelements as the
most abundant repeat class within the genome [19].

Similar analyses investigating crop genome compositions
based on next generation sequence technologies have
been reported [45,46]. In our study c0t-1 DNA isolation
was used for the classification of the major repeat
families within the B. vulgaris genome and satellite
DNA was identified as a highly abundant repeat class.
In contrast to genome sequencing projects reflecting the
whole genome in its native composition, c0t-1 DNA isolation represents only the repetitive fraction and enables
therefore the targeted isolation of major repeats.
Furthermore, less sequence data is necessary for the
detection of major repeats using c0t DNA isolation compared with next generation sequence reads. We used
only 442 kB (0.06% of the genome) sequence data for
the detection of the major repeat families of the B. vulgaris genome while 33.3 Mb (0.77%) of P. sativum [19],
58.91 Mb (1%) of barley [46] and 78.54 Mb (7%) of soybean [45] were analyzed to detect the repeat composition. Therefore, c 0 t DNA isolation is a very efficient
method for the identification of the repetitive DNA of
genomes not sequenced yet.
Macas et al. (2007) identified 17 novel tandem repeat
families, and two minisatellites were physically mapped
on P. sativum chromosomes [19]. In order to demonstrate the potential of the c 0 t-1 DNA library for the
detection of novel repeat classes we focused on the
identification of tandemly repeated sequences, particularly on the identification of minisatellites. So far, the
targeted isolation of minisatellites from plant genomes
has not been described and this repeat type is only
poorly characterized. It is not feasible to isolate most
minisatellites as restriction satellites because of their
short length, unusual base composition and hence,
absence of recognition sites. The identification of nine
minisatellite families as described here shows the potential of c0t DNA analysis for the rapid and targeted isolation of minisatellites from genomes. In addition we
identified three satellite families undiscovered yet
because of their moderate abundance.
In contrast to typical G/C-rich minisatellites [13], all
nine B. vulgaris families show a low G/C content: six of
the nine families have a G/C-content between 24% to
33% (Table 1). Repetitive sequences are often subject to
modification by cytosine methylation. It is known that
deamination converts 5-methylcytosine to thymine,
resulting in an increased AT-content [47]. This might
be a possible reason of the low G/C level of B. vulgaris
minisatellites. Furthermore, the monomers of the B. vulgaris minisatellite families are different in sequence
length and nucleotide composition from the 14 to 16 bp
G/C-rich core sequence of minisatellites in A. thaliana
or human [25,26].
Most conventional plant satellites show a low G/C
content [48]. However, the FokI-satellite has a G/C

Zakrzewski et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/8

content of 60% which is in contrast to the HinfI-satellite
and AluI-satellite and other satellites described in B.
vulgaris. Moreover, the monomer size of 130 bp of the
FokI-satellite is different from the typical monomer size
of plant satellites of 160-180 bp or 320 to 370 bp [15],
whereas monomers of HinfI-satellite and AluI-satellite
fall into the typical monomer size range.
Only two of the nine minisatellite families (BvMSat03
and BvMSat04) show the typical ladder-like pattern in
Southern analyses. Dimers of BvMSat03 were detectable
after restriction of genomic DNA with BsmAI (Figure
2B, lane 2). However, partial restriction with BsmAI
generates di- to decamers of BvMSat03 (not shown),
indicating the highly conserved recognition site of
BsmAI in BvMSat03-monomers.
Hybridization of minisatellites to MspI and HpaII
digested DNA indicates cytosine methylation of the
recognition site CCGG. The HinfI-satellite and AluIsatellite family show also a strong methylation, while a
reduced CNG methylation was detectable for some
FokI-satellite copies. This might be an indication that
some FokI-satellite copies lacking CNG methylation
might be linked to the activation of transcription or to
chromatin remodeling [49-52].
Little is known about the localization of minisatellites
on plant chromosomes. So far, only two minisatellite
families were physically mapped on chromosomes of P.
sativum using FISH [19]. In contrast to minisatellites of
P. sativum detectable only on one and two chromosome
pairs [19], respectively, the B. vulgaris minisatellites
were detectable mostly on all 18 chromosomes with different signal strength, preferentially distributed in the
intercalary heterochromatin and terminal chromosome
regions. This pattern of chromosomal localization shows
similarity to the distribution of microsatellite sequences
on B. vulgaris chromosomes, which show a dispersed
organization along chromosomes including telomeres
and intercalary chromosomal regions, but are mostly
excluded from the centromere [36]. This is in contrast
to the chromosomal localization of the highly abundant
satellite families pBV and pEV and the satellite family
pAv34 [33], which are detectable in large tandem arrays
in centromeric/pericentromeric, intercalary and subtelomeric regions, respectively. Only BvMSat08 and
BvMSat09 can be found in large tandem array blocks
within the intercalary heterochromatin.
The FokI, AluI and HinfI satellite families show dispersed localization in smaller arrays with different array
sizes among chromosomes, preferentially in the intercalary heterochromatin and in terminal chromosome
regions, respectively. The HinfI-satellite is predominantly distributed in terminal chromosome regions. The
pAv34 satellite is also localized in subtelomeric chromosome positions [33]. However, no copies of pAv34 were

Page 10 of 14

detected within the 13 kb BAC [EMBL:DQ374018] and
the 11 kb BAC [EMBL:DQ374019] that contain a tandem array of the HinfI-satellite consisting of 14 and 26
monomers, respectively, indicating no interspersion of
both satellite families. High resolution FISH on pachytene chromosomes or chromatin fibers using probes of
pAv34 and the HinfI-satellite could be used to gain
information about possible interspersion or physically
neighborhood of both satellite families.
Because of their small size (2-3 μm) and similar morphology (most chromosomes are meta- to submetacentric) FISH karyotype analysis of B. vulgaris has not
been established yet. In contrast to conventional staining
techniques [53], which are not efficient for reliable karyotyping of small chromosomes, FISH is an applicable
method for the discrimination of the B. vulgaris chromosomes. Chromosome 1 can be identified by strong
signals of terminal 18S-5.8S-25S rRNA genes while
chromosome 4 is detectable by 5S rRNA hybridization
patterns [54]. FISH using probes of BvMSat08 enables
the identification of another chromosome pair, due to
the localization of the large BvMSat08 blocks on both
chromosome arms. Hence, this minisatellite may be an
important cytogenetic marker for future karyotyping
based on FISH. Also, because of their specific chromosomal localization, the minisatellite BvMSat09, the AluI
satellite and the HinfI satellite can serve as cytogenetic
markers and support FISH karyotyping in B. vulgaris.
It has been reported that human minisatellites originated from retroviral LTR-like sequences or from the 5’
end of Alu elements [55,56] but also other scenarios of
the origin and the evolution were described in human
and in primates [57,58]. In plants, only few data are
available about the origin and the evolution of minisatellite sequences. We propose a possible process which
might describe the origin and/or evolution of minisatellites from microsatellites in the genome of B. vulgaris.
Sequence analysis suggests that BvMSat07 originated
from a microsatellite with the 5 bp monomer sequence
GATCA. During microsatellite evolution complex arrays
of six monomers evolved, which were subsequently tandemly arranged. The resulting minisatellite is 30 bp in
size and consists of one GAAAA, AATAA and GTTCA
and three adjacent GATCA monomers. The 5 bp subrepeats differing from the GATCA monomer sequence
might have originated from the GATCA-motif by point
mutation. The complex repeat shows structural similarities to higher-order structures of satellites, e.g. the
human alpha satellite [59]. A satellite higher-order
structure is defined as monomers which form tandemly
arranged highly homogenous multimeric repeat units
[59]. One complex repeat of the microsatellite might
have been duplicated and enlarged by replication slippage resulting in a BvMSat07 array (Figure 4) and its

Zakrzewski et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/8

copy number might have been increased by recombination between homologous loci.
Another scenario of minisatellite origin and array
enlargement can be concluded from the minisatellite
family BvMSat05. The palindromic sequences within the
highly conserved 50 bp sequence adjacent to BvMSat05
arrays may form secondary DNA structures, which may
interfere with the DNA polymerase during DNA replication. This may result in slippage replication of the DNA
motif upstream, contributing to the generation and
enlargement of BvMSat05 arrays. Moreover, FISH
revealed a subtelomeric localization of BvMSat05 clusters on some chromosomes, hence, the head to head
junction of head to tail arrays typical for BvMSat05 may
result from breakage-fusion-bridge cycles as postulated
for tandem repeats near at terminal regions of rye chromosomes [60]. It has been reported that palindromic
sequences may induce genomic instability through provoking double strand breaks and recombination [61].
Therefore, the head to head junction may also be the
result of DNA repair following possible double strand
breaks within BvMSat05 arrays.
It has also been discussed that tandemly repeated
sequences are derived from 3’ UTR regions of retrotransposons [62]. Analysis of retrotransposons in B. vulgaris
[40,63,64] did not reveal any homology to minisatellite
arrays or adjacent regions. However, we detected LTR
sequences of a yet uncharacterized retrotransposon in
the close vicinity of BvMSat04 arrays (not shown).
Therefore, the evolution and dispersion of BvMSat04
arrays within the B. vulgaris genome might also be the
result of the activity of this retrotransposon.
In this study we focused in detail on the characterization of novel minisatellites and satellites. Nevertheless,
these tandem repeats make up only 6.8% of the 517
uncharacterized c0t-1 sequences indicating that the c0t-1
library is an efficient source for the identification of
further repeat classes. Examples are the 118 c 0 t-1
sequences possessing motifs of retrotransposon families
as well as the identification of the envelope-like Copia
element Cotzilla [40].

Conclusions
We isolated highly to moderately repetitive DNA
sequences from B. vulgaris originating from a c0t-1 DNA
library. Providing the first comprehensive classification of
repeats, we observed that the satellites pBV and pEV
form the most abundant repeat families in B. vulgaris.
We identified nine minisatellite and three previously
unknown satellite families demonstrating that the analysis of c 0 t-1 DNA is an efficient method for the rapid
and targeted isolation of tandemly repeated sequences,
particularly of minisatellites from plant genomes. Minisatellites in B. vulgaris display a low G/C content and

Page 11 of 14

deviate strongly from the G/C-rich minisatellite core
sequence observed in A. thaliana and human [25,26]
showing that a minisatellite core motif is not conserved
in plant genomes. Physical mapping of the minisatellites
on chromosomes using FISH revealed a mainly dispersed chromosomal distribution pattern. The possible
origin, enlargement and amplification of minisatellites
arrays were concluded for some minisatellite families.
Complex structures of microsatellite arrays may play a
role for the generation of minisatellites. Moreover, DNA
sequences that contain palindromic motifs may be
linked to slippage replication due to interfering with
DNA polymerase during replication and may therefore
be involved in the origin of minisatellites.

Methods
Plant material and DNA preparation

Plants of Beta vulgaris ssp. vulgaris genotype KWS2320
were grown under greenhouse conditions. Genomic
DNA was isolated from young leaves using the CTAB
(cetyltrimethyl/ammonium bromide) standard protocol
[65].
Construction of the c0t-1 DNA library

The c0t-1 DNA was prepared with some modifications
according to Zwick et al. [9]. 640 μg of genomic DNA
was dissolved in 1600 μl water and sheared at 99°C for
10 minutes followed by sonication at 80°C for 3 minutes
to generate DNA fragments ranging in size predominantly between 0.5 to 1.0 kb. Renaturation of DNA fragments was carried out in a 0.3 M NaCl solution at 65°C
after initial denaturation at 92°C for 10 minutes. The
renaturation time was calculated according to Zwick et
al. [9]. S1 nuclease treatment followed to remove single
stranded DNA and single strand overhangs on renaturated double stranded DNA. The enzyme was inactivated by adding stop solution (3 M Tris pH 8.0, 0.5 M
EDTA) according to Ostermeier et al. [66] and incubation at 72°C for 20 min. Blunt end c0t-1 DNA fragments
were ligated into the SmaI site of dephosphorylated
pUC18 vector. After transformation of XL1Blue cells
(Stratagene), positive clones were identified by blue/
white screening and transferred into 384-well plates,
grown in LB freezing medium and stored at -80°C.
Sequencing of c0t-1 clones

Clones were grown in Terrific Broth (TB) medium (1.2%
peptone, 2.4% yeast extract, 72 mM K2 HPO 4 , 17 mM
KH2PO4 and 0.4% glycerol) including 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37°C. Small-scale plasmid isolation was performed by the TELT procedure [67]. Plasmids were
sequenced on an ABI 3730XL sequencer (Applied Biosystems; Foster City, CA/USA) using BigDye terminator
chemistry, in forward (5’-CGTTGTAAAACGACG
GCCAGT-3’) and/or reverse (5’-CAGGAAACAGCTAT
GACCATG-3’) directions.

Computational methods

Sequences in c0t-1 DNA library, which are homologous
to previously characterized B. vulgaris repeats, were
identified using local BLAST option of the BioEdit software [68] with a representative query sequence of the
repeat family. Novel c0t-1 DNA sequences were characterized using the EMBL database homology search
against nucleotide and amino acid sequences and an evalue threshold of 10-3. The remaining fraction of the
c0t-1 DNA without homology to EMBL database entries
was used for the identification of tandem repeats using
Tandem Repeats Finder [69]. Subsequently, c 0 t-1
sequences containing tandem repeats were used as
query sequence for the identification of further DNA
copies from BAC end sequences [39], (Holtgräwe and
Weisshaar, in preparation) to reveal their abundance
and array structures. The DNA sequences of each tandem repeat family were aligned manually using the Phylogenetic Data Editor [70]. The detection of G/C
content and identity values of each tandem repeat family
was determined by a G/C Content Calculator and ClustalX [71] using at least 20 randomly selected monomers
of representative tandem arrays. Sequences contigs have
been established using DNASTAR Lasergene v8.0.

Onozuka-R10 (Serva) and 20% (v/v) pectinase from A.
niger; followed by spreading of nuclei on slides. Probes
of tandem repeats were labelled with biotin-16-dUTP
(Roche) by PCR according to Schwarzacher et al. [73]
while 18S-5.8S-25S rRNA genes were labelled by nicktranslation with digoxygenin-11-dUTP (Roche). The
hybridization and detection were performed according
to Schmidt et al. [54]. Chromosome preparations were
counterstained with DAPI (4’,6’-diamino-2-phenylindole)
and mounted in antifade solution (CitiFluor). The examination of slides was carried out with a Zeiss Axioplan2
Imaging fluorescent microscope with filters 09 (FITC),
15 (Cy3) and 02 (DAPI). The images were acquired with
the Applied Spectral Imaging v. 3.3 software coupled
with the high-resolution CCD camera ASI BV300-20A.
The contrast of images was optimized using only functions affecting whole image equally by Adobe Photoshop
7.0 software.

PCR conditions

Primer pairs were derived from conserved regions of
minisatellite and satellite monomers. The PCR reactions
with 50 ng genomic DNA and a final primer concentration of 0.5 μM were performed in a 20 μl volume containing 0.2 mM dNTPs and 1 unit of GoTaq polymerase
(Promega). The PCR conditions were 94°C for 3 min,
followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 47°C to 65°C
depending on the primer melting temperature of each
repeat family, for 30 s, 72°C for 40 s and a final incubation at 72°C for 5 min. For the generation of probes for
Southern hybridization and fluorescent in situ hybridization, the same primers or M13 primers were used to
amplify tandem repeats from c0t-1 clones.
