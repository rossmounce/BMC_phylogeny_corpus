Background
Myrtaceae family includes more than 3,800 species of
trees and shrubs, distributed mainly in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Representatives of this
family have great ecological significance for forest ecosystems, and are economically important species in the
pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic and perfumery industry
[1]. The genus Hexachlamys Berg. (Myrtaceae) has
about 10 species distributed from the Southern to the
Southeast of Brazil, and it also occurs in Paraguay,
Argentina, Bolivia and Uruguay [2,3]. Since 1968 it has
been considered an independent genus. It is distinguished morphologically from the genus Eugenia by
pentamerous or hexamerous flowers and exserta radicle,
and as many genera and species of the Myrtaceae family,
it has a complex taxonomic classification [2,4,5]. The
goal of this study was to conduct a molecular phylogenetic analysis among species of the genus Hexachlamys
(Myrtaceae) using chloroplast (cpDNA) and nuclear
(nrDNA) markers, and to verify its phylogenetic relationships with the genus Eugenia in order to contribute
to the systematics and taxonomy of it.
Methods
The samples were collected as leaf material(from herbaria species and samples collected in the field) of the
genus Hexachlamys representing all described species,
as indicated in herbariums and species of the Eugenia
genus that occur in the Rio Grande do Sul state. Total
genomic DNA was extracted using the CTAB method
based on the protocol already described [6] and used for

the PCR reactions. PCR products were sequenced on
ABI PRISM 3100 sequencer (Applied Biosystem).
Nucleotide sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW
[7] implemented in MEGA5 (Molecular Evolutionary
Genetics Analysis) version 5.0 [8], then checked visually
and carefully improved manually before analysis. The
phylogenetic analysis was reconstructed after nucleotide
sequence alignments using three different approaches:
the neighbor-joining (NJ), the Bayesian and the Maximum-Likelihood (ML) methods. The NJ, Bayesian and
ML analysis were performed in MEGA 5.0, MrBayes [9]
and PhyML [10], respectively.

Results and conclusions
To date we obtained DNA sequences of 21 species of
the genus Eugenia and seven species of the genus Hexachlamys. Universal primers that amplify chloroplast
region (trnL-trnF, trnL-intron, ycf5, accD, rbcLa, psbAtrnH, rpoB, rpoC1, ndhJ, matK and rps16) and nuclear
(ITS) were tested. The regions used for the phylogenetic
analisys were chloroplast accD, rpoB, rpoC1genes and
the nuclear ITS, since the other chloroplast regions were
not possible to amplify and sequence in all sampled species. These cpDNA and nrDNA regions presented
polymorphisms among species studied. Results from
Bayesian, NJ and ML tree analysis produced similar
topologies and revealed that Hexachlamys species did
not form a monophyletic clade. The Hexachlamys species have grouped together Eugenia species with high
bootstrap values, indicating that Hexachlamys can be a
synonymous of genus Eugenia. These results corroborate
with morphological data [11]. To confirm these results,
other cpDNA and nrDNA markers will be tested and
Hexachlamys species will be collected to substitute
the species obtained in herbarium, since we found

difficulties in the amplification of these species with all
markers previously tested. This study can contribute to
taxonomic classification of this group, as well as the
field of conservation, since these species have an important economically and ecologically role.
