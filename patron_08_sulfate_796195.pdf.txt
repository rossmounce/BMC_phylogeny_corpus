Abstract
Background: The sulfate assimilation pathway is present in photosynthetic organisms, fungi, and
many bacteria, providing reduced sulfur for the synthesis of cysteine and methionine and a range
of other metabolites. In photosynthetic eukaryotes sulfate is reduced in the plastids whereas in
aplastidic eukaryotes the pathway is cytosolic. The only known exception is Euglena gracilis, where
the pathway is localized in mitochondria. To obtain an insight into the evolution of the sulfate
assimilation pathway in eukaryotes and relationships of the differently compartmentalized isoforms
we determined the locations of the pathway in lineages for which this was unknown and performed
detailed phylogenetic analyses of three enzymes involved in sulfate reduction: ATP sulfurylase
(ATPS), adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate reductase (APR) and sulfite reductase (SiR).
Results: The inheritance of ATPS, APR and the related 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate
reductase (PAPR) are remarkable, with multiple origins in the lineages that comprise the
opisthokonts, different isoforms in chlorophytes and streptophytes, gene fusions with other
enzymes of the pathway, evidence a eukaryote to prokaryote lateral gene transfer, changes in
substrate specificity and two reversals of cellular location of host- and endosymbiont-originating
enzymes. We also found that the ATPS and APR active in the mitochondria of Euglena were
inherited from its secondary, green algal plastid.
Conclusion: Our results reveal a complex history for the enzymes of the sulfate assimilation
pathway. Whilst they shed light on the origin of some characterised novelties, such as a recently
described novel isoform of APR from Bryophytes and the origin of the pathway active in the
mitochondria of Euglenids, the many distinct and novel isoforms identified here represent an
excellent resource for detailed biochemical studies of the enzyme structure/function relationships.

Background
Sulfur is found in all organisms as a constituent of the proteogenic amino acids cysteine and methionine and in
many coenzymes and other metabolites. In most of these
compounds sulfur is present in a reduced form of organic
thiols or sulfides. The major form of sulfur in nature, how-

ever, is inorganic sulfate. Sulfate is taken up into cells,
reduced, and incorporated into cysteine in the pathway of
sulfate assimilation [1,2]. Since sulfate is a stable molecule, for reduction it must be activated. The adenylation to
adenosine 5'phosphosulfate (APS) is catalyzed by ATPS.
Plant ATPS is a homotetramer of 52–54 kDa polypeptides

[3]. Bacterial ATPS, on the other hand, consists of four
heterodimers composed from 35 kDa CysD and 53 kDa
CysN subunits [4]. Some organisms, such as fungi and
many bacteria, require a second activation step, i.e. phosphorylation of APS by APS kinase to 3'phosphoadenosine
5'phosphosulfate (PAPS). In fungi, ATPS and APS kinase
are fused into a single 59 to 64 kDa subunit that assemble
into a homohexamer [5].
The reduction of activated sulfate consists of two steps.
First, APS or PAPS is reduced to sulfite by APR or PAPS
reductase (PAPR). APR exists as a homodimer in prokaryotes and it is fused to thioredoxin in plants and green
algae [6]. Most APRs contain an FeS cluster, however a variant of the enzyme from early branching streptophyte lineages (bryophytes and lycopodiophytes) has been shown
to catalyze APS reduction without the FeS chemistry [6-9].
PAPR is similar to bacterial APR but does not bind the FeS
cluster [6,10].
In the second step, sulfite is reduced to sulfide by sulfite
reductase (SiR). Plant SiR is a monomeric protein of 65
kDa containing a siroheme and an FeS cluster [11]. In
contrast, the bacterial NADPH-SiR is an oligomer of eight
66 kDa flavoprotein subunits (CysJ) and four 64 kDa siroheme and [4Fe-4S] cluster binding hemoproteins (CysI)
[12]. SiRs in fungi are composed from α and β subunits of
116 kDa and 167 kDa respectively. Similar to bacterial
SiR, the fungal enzyme requires siroheme, FAD and FMN
[13]. Sulfide is incorporated into the amino acid skeleton
of O-acetylserine (OAS) or O-acetylhomoserine in fungi,
to form cysteine or homocysteine, respectively, in a reaction catalyzed by O-acetyl(homo)serine-(thiol)lyase
(OASTL). OAS itself is synthesized by acetylation of serine
by serine acetyltransferase.
Although sulfate assimilation is essential for the incorporation of reduced sulfur into bioorganic compounds, the
pathway seems to be readily dispensable when the lifestyle of the organism allows. It is absent in all metazoans,
which satisfy their need for reduced sulfur by the ingestion of proteins to obtain the sulfur containing amino
acids cysteine and methionine. Bacterial and protistan
parasites also lack a sulfate assimilation pathway. In bacterial species that have undergone a significant genome
reduction, the sulfate assimilation operon is almost invariably lost [14,15]. This is enabled by the adaptation of the
nutrition of these parasites for metabolites provided by
the host. A third group of organisms usually lacking sulfate assimilation are Archaea and bacteria using dissimilatory sulfide (or thiosulfate) oxidation or sulfate reduction
for respiration and energy conversion. The habitats of
such organisms always contain sulfide [16], therefore,
there is no need for sulfate assimilation to sustain cysteine
biosynthesis. The enzymes of the dissimilatory pathway,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/39

despite catalyzing the same chemical reaction, are either
highly divergent (ATPS) or entirely unrelated (APR and
SiR) to those of the sulfate assimilation pathway.
In plants, OAS and cysteine are synthesized in all three
compartments capable of protein synthesis, i.e. cytosol,
plastid, and mitochondria [17]. Sulfate activation, however, takes place in the cytosol and plastids, whereas sulfate reduction is confined to plastids [17,18]. Since sulfite
reductase utilizes ferredoxin as an electron donor, the
association of sulfate reduction with photosynthesis and
plastids might be general for all photosynthetic eukaryotes. However, there is a remarkable exception, the photosynthetic flagellate Euglena gracilis, in which activity of
enzymes involved in sulfate reduction and cysteine synthesis have been identified in the mitochondria [19-21].
Experiments with purified mitochondria with the outer
membrane removed, found that assay products accumulated largely in the medium indicating that in Euglena
ATPS, APR, and SiR seem to be located in a sulfate metabolizing centre on the outside of the mitochondrial inner
membrane [21].
This high variability in the components and locations of
sulfate assimilation in eukaryotic lineages provokes the
question of the origin of the pathway, especially plastidcontaining lineages, which generally reduce sulfate in that
organelle. Here we present the results of detailed phylogenetic analyses of each of enzymes that constitute the pathway. In addition we address the sub-cellular localization
of the pathway, with a special focus on the secondaryplastid containing genus, Euglena.

Results
Eukaryotic lineages reduce sulfate in one of three cellular
compartments
An investigation of the complete genomes of many
eukaryotic species and several others from which extensive expressed sequence tag data has been generated
revealed genes for the sulfate assimilation enzymes ATPS,
APR/PAPR, and SiR in all eukaryotes with photosynthetic
plastids as well as fungi, Phytopthora spp. and the choanozoan, Monosiga brevicollis (Table 1). In the metazoans, the
mycetozoan Dictyostelium discodium and the parasitic alveolate Toxoplasma gondii, the genes for the reductive part of
the pathway are missing, however ATPS and APS kinase
are still present. These species do not reduce sulfate but
receive cysteine in their nutrition or produce it by transsulfuration of methionine [2]. The sulfate activation
enzymes are, however, essential for the synthesis of PAPS,
which is the form of activated sulfate required for sulfation reactions. Sulfation of proteins and polysaccharides
is a widespread modification. Hence, ATPS and APS
kinase are ubiquitous among eukaryotes and in some lin-

In the species of aplastidic groups, most enzymes lack any

presumed to be cytosolic. The exceptions are metazoan

PAPS synthetases that have been localized both to cytosol
and the nucleus [23]. Consistent with biochemical data
(reviewed in [1,2]), in species with primary photosynthetic plastids almost all sulfate-reducing enzymes show
clear plastid-targeting pre-sequences at the N' terminus as
indicated by an N terminal extension (compared to bacterial homologues) and amino acid composition consistent
with a plastid transit peptide for each species [24]. The
exceptions are isoforms of ATPS and APS kinase from a
few plant and red algal species lacking any N' -terminal
targeting information and are thus predicted to be
cytosolic. These enzymes are probably involved in the
production of PAPS for sulfation reactions as in other
eukaryotes. Experimental evidence from Arabidopsis and
other plant species supports this, with ATPS activity being
identified in the plastids and the cytosol but APR activity
only found in the plastid [25,26]. Only one of the four
isoforms, however, was identified in a proteomic study of
the plastid [27]. Anomalously, all four ATPS isoforms
identified from Arabidopsis have N' terminal extensions
typical of plastid transit peptides.
In contrast to plants, no biochemical data for the pathway's localization exists for algae. The plastid transit peptides of green algae, especially, are shorter than average
[24,28] and prediction software cannot distinguish plastid and mitochondrial targeting pre-sequences [24,28].
Therefore, we addressed the localization of sulfate assimilation in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by
immuno-transmission electron microscopy. In Western
blot analysis, antisera against Arabidopsis APR and SiR
recognized single protein bands of 50 and 75 kDa, respectively, in C. reinhardtii protein extracts (Additional File 1).
Signals from both antibodies were found to be almost
exclusively within the plastid, indicating that the plastid is
the site of sulfate reduction (Figure 1 and Additional File
2). Surprisingly, the signal was not distributed evenly
within this compartment and instead was concentrated
around the starch sheath, in close association with the
pyrenoid (Figure 1). Interestingly, in the bryophyte P. patens, localization of APR by immuno-fluorescence of a GFP
fusion protein also revealed an uneven distribution of the
protein in the plastid [8]. The close co-localization of the
two enzymes in Chlamydomonas indicates that the
enzymes of sulfate activation and reduction may form a
multienzyme complex similar to that of serine acetyltransferase and OASTL [17].
In algae with secondary plastids, enzymes for sulfate
assimilation contained N terminal extensions (signal peptide followed by transit peptide) indicative of location in
plastids [29,30] with one exception: enzymes of E. gracilis
lacked the typical Euglenid tri-partite (signal peptide followed by transit peptide, and stop transfer sequence) N'
terminal pre-sequence required for transit to its secondary

plastids [31] and instead encoded a pre-sequence typical
of mitochondrial targeting (Figure 2). The subcellular
localization tools, TargetP and iPSORT, also suggested a
mitochondrial location for these proteins. We determined
the ATPS transcripts identified from the E. gracilis EST
project to be full length, as evidenced by the presence of a
splice leader. Though the splice leader was not apparent
from the APR and SiR ESTs the coding sequences are likely
complete due to the presence of an obvious N terminal
extension compared to bacterial isoforms. The presence of
a mitochondrial pre-sequence is in accordance with biochemical data from that species locating sulfate assimilation to mitochondria [19,21,32].
In order to determine the origin of mitochondria-targeted
enzymes found in Euglena and to investigate the relationships of the enzymes found in other eukaryotes, particularly to determine if isoforms found in the cytosol of
aplastidic eukaryotes are related to those found in plastids, we performed phylogenetic analyses of the enzymes
of the pathway.

Multiple origins and gene-fusions of ATPS
The general distribution of taxa in the ATPS tree is unexpected (Figure 3). Most notably, isoforms encoded by species belonging to well defined groups, such as
Opisthokonts (represented in our analysis by fungi, metazoans, mycetazoans and choanozoans), cyanobacteria
and Viridiplantae are not monophyletic.

Fungal ATPS shows specific relationship to that found in
Rhodobacterales, which unlike other α-proteobacteria
lack the bacterial type CysN/CysD enzyme. However,
these bacterial ATPSs are not at the base of the clade; that
position being occupied by eukaryotic ATPS isoforms
(from the slime mold D. discoidum and the alveolate T.
gondii) involved only in the production of PAPS. This, and
the fact that no other bacteria are found at the base of the
clade but instead in a sisterhood to an ambiguous group
containing cyanobacteria and eukaryotes, makes it uncertain if ATPS is of mitochondrial (α-proteobacterial) origin
in these eukaryotes or if a lateral gene transfer has taken
place at a later date.
Two other Opisthokont lineages, metazoans and the choanozoan M. brevicolis, encode an ATPS only distantly
related to the fungal one. This isoform is most related to
those found in plants and stramenopiles and is fused at
the N' terminus to APS kinase. The fusion of ATPS and
APS kinase is very common, occurring also in fungi where
the APS kinase domain is attached to C terminus of ATPS;
however, in fungi the function of the APS kinase domain
is regulatory rather than catalytic. The most likely explanation is that ATPS and APS kinase were fused in the ancestral eukaryotes, as supported by the existence of this fused
protein in diverse lineages (metazoans, choanozoans, and
stramenopiles). The gene must then have split in red algae
and plants. If the enzyme found in fungi, D. discoidum and
T. gondii is of α-proteobacterial origin then the ancestor of
these groups and those that encode the fusion protein
would have contained both isoforms and losses would
have occurred multiple times in various lineages.

Unexpectedly, fusions of ATPS with another enzyme were
revealed in the stramenopiles Thalassiosira pseudonana,
Phaeodactylum tricornutum, and Phytophthora sojae and the
haptophytes Pavlova lutheri and Emiliania huxleyi. In these
organisms ATPS is fused to inorganic pyrophosphatase.
The hydrolysis of pyrophosphate is an efficient mechanism to shift the very unfavorable equilibrium of ATPS
reaction to the site of the products. Indeed, for enzymatic
synthesis of APS the ATPS is coupled to pyrophosphatase
to increase yields of the product [32]. Even more intriguing is a fusion protein of ATPS found in Heterocapsa triquetra. Here, ATPS is fused to APR. This fusion most
probably ensures a rapid channelling of APS to the site of
its reduction, increasing the rate of sulfite production.
Existence of this fusion supports the hypothesis that the
enzymes of sulfate assimilation may form a multi-enzyme
complex as recent experiments in onion suggest [33].
As discussed before, plastidial ATPS isoforms from streptophytes resolved in a clade that contained only eukaryotes (Figure 3). Most likely the eukaryotic, host-encoded
isoform was targeted to the plastid after endosymbiosis
and the gene inherited from the cyanobacterial endosymbiont was lost. The enzymes found in chlorophytes, however, are not of the same origin as those found in plants.
Instead, the chlorophytes encoded ATPSs are robustly
related to isoforms found in algae with secondary plastids
and to certain cyanobacteria.
Evidence for a eukaryote to cyanobacteria lateral gene
transfer
Association of plant and algal genes with cyanobacteria
usually indicates a cyanobacterial endosymbiont (plastidial) origin, however, in the case of ATPS, this is unlikely
for several reasons. Firstly, since primary plastids were
likely acquired only once [34-36] this cyanobacterial
enzyme would have been lost twice, independently, in red
algae and in streptophytes, while chlorophytes must have
lost the host isoform after the divergence of streptophytes.
Secondly, the cyanobacteria in this clade do not branch at
the base but are strongly supported as sisters to chloro-

phytes to the exclusion of other algae. Only two genera of
marine cyanobacteria are represented in this clade:
Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, the other cyanobacteria
being found elsewhere in the tree. Intriguingly, the same
two genera were found to have obtained a fructose 1,6
bisphosphate aldolase from a red alga [37]. Thirdly, the
clade also contains chromist algal species (haptophytes
and stramenopiles) and dinoflagellates. These latter
groups contain secondary plastids of red-algal origin
[34,38,39] but the red algae are not present in this clade,
meaning that inheritance through their plastids is
unlikely.
The final piece of evidence against a cyanobacterial origin
of the ATPS found in chlorophyte plastids is the sisterhood to the fungal and α-proteobacterial clade discussed
above. It is not possible to state conclusively that the isoforms in the eukaryotes found in these clades are of
prokaryotic origin. The tree, therefore, strongly suggests a
lateral gene transfer of ATPS to these cyanobacteria, rather
than cyanobacterial origin of this enzyme in plastids.
However, if this is true, then the origin of ATPS in chlorophytes and algae with secondary plastids in unclear.
Isoform retargeting of ATPS
In the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae, it appears that the
different ATPS isoforms were subjected to a cellular targeting reversal. Two isoforms of ATPS were identified in the
complete genome of this species. The first is quite distinct
from that found in other lineages and related only to
those encoded in other rhodophytes (Figure 3). The origin
of this cytosolic ATPS in red algae remains unsolved,
although it is perhaps most likely a derived paralogue of
the second isoform, which resolved within a clade containing only eukaryotes. Intriguingly, although clustering
with metazoans, this isoform encodes an N terminal
sequence with all the features of a red-lineage transit peptide including a full 'FVAP' motif [24,40]. A similar phenomenon was observed in the diatom T. pseudonana,
which also encodes two isoforms of ATPS. According to
the currently predicted gene models, which manual examination could not fault, the first is fused at the N terminus
to APS kinase and encodes an N terminal signal peptide,
followed by a region with several features of a diatom
transit peptide [41,42]. The second T. pseudonana isoform
contains no extraneous N-terminal sequence by comparison to bacterial isoforms and is thus predicted to be
cytosolic. The fused protein clusters, with good support,
with aplastidic stramenopile relatives in the clade likely of
eukaryotic origin (discussed above). This presumed
cytosolic isoform is specifically related (100 maximum
likelihood bootstraps) to another diatom (P. tricornutum)
sequence, which does encode plastid-targeting presequences and clusters with other plastid-targeted isoforms from a variety of algae, suggesting the targeting of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/39

the plastid and cytosolic isoforms were reversed in T. pseudonana.
This reversal of location of plastid and cytosolic isoforms
must have occurred independently in C. merole and T.
pseudonana and is highly unusual.
Isoforms of plastid-targeted APR that do not bind an FeS
cofactor are of PAPR origin
The enzymes catalyzing reduction of activated sulfate to
sulfite, APR and PAPR are relatively similar sharing
approx. 20% amino acid identity and a common active
center represented by the amino acid sequence K/R E C G
L/I H [10]. Initially, sulfate reduction was proposed to be
PAPS dependent as the first organisms in which the pathway has been resolved were PAPR containing Escherichia
coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Saccharomyces cerevisiae
[10]. APS dependent assimilation of sulfate was, however,
discovered in algae and plants [43] and thus it was
believed that presence of plastids is the distinction
between APS and PAPS pathways [10]. However, recently
APRs were identified in a wide range of bacteria and the
APS dependent reduction seems to be prevalent. While all
fungi analyzed to date reduce PAPS, in prokaryotes the
enzyme is limited to some groups of γ-proteobacteria, and
cyanobacteria. The major difference between the two
enzymes seemed to be the presence of [Fe4S4] cluster
ligated by two invariant Cys pairs in all known APRs [6].
However, a novel isoform of the enzyme from the moss
Physcomitrella patens, lacking the cluster, has been shown
to reduce APS rather than PAPS [8]. This isoform was
named APR-B to distinguish it from the majority of isoforms (denoted APR), which do require the presence of
[Fe4S4]. It was identified in several other lower plant genera, such as Selaginella and Marchantia [44]. This demonstrates that whereas presence of the cluster is invariantly
linked to use of APS as substrate, its absence is not a necessary determinant of PAPR. The recently sequenced
genomes of several secondary algae and of the choanozoan M. brevicollis encode homologues of the APR-B isoform without the Cys pairs binding the FeS cluster.
However, biochemical analysis revealed a high APR activity in the protein extracts of T. pseudonana, E. huxleyi, and
H. triquetra [45] Kopriva S., unpublished). Position of
these isoforms on the APR/PAPR phylogenetic tree was
therefore of particular interest.

Our analysis revealed that the PAPR found in fungi and M.
brevicollis show specific relationship while that of P. sojae
is found among prokaryotes, specifically cyanobacteria
and γ-proteobacteria (Figure 4). This does not, however,
give any support to a plastid origin for this gene since the
red algae, to which the plastids found in other heterokonts are related, are found elsewhere in the tree. The P.
sojae branch within the cyanobacteria is weakly supported

of taxa (not shown) did not break the relationship indicating that lateral gene transfer is a possibility.
The APR of organisms with primary plastids can be found
in the same clade in the expected order (rhodophytes at
the base and chlorophytes and streptophytes as sister subclades). As stated above, aplastidic eukaryotes appear to
reduce PAPS supporting that this APS reducing enzyme is
likely of endosymbiont (plastid) origin. However, the origin of this plastid-targeted isoform is only supported by a
single cyanobacterial sequence (Nodularia). Cyanobacteria have been found to reduce either PAPS or APS [46].
Interestingly, almost all cyanobacterial genomes
sequenced to date encode a PAPR. On the other hand, biochemical analysis revealed APS reduction in many cyanobacteria such as Symploca, Nodularia, Leptolyngbya, or
Chroococcus (Wiedemann G., Kopriva S., unpublished)
but very little sequence data exists for these taxa and the
amplification of the gene remains elusive. A fragment of a
gene for APR from APS-reducing Plectonema has been
cloned and sequenced and shown to branch at the base of
the streptophyte APR clade in a previous, though
restricted, analysis [6], however the sequence was too
short for inclusion in this analysis. Since the Nodularia
sequence is found at the base of the archaeplastidial clade,
it is still possible that the APR in this lineage was obtained
from their primary cyanobacterial endosymbiont.
The APR-B enzymes found in P. patens and the two Selaginella species branched outside of the well-supported
clade that includes APR from plants. They were instead
strongly related (100 maximum likelihood bootstraps) to
chromist and chlorarachniophyte algae with dinoflagellates and an additional stramenopile isoform branching
with good support (74 maximum likelihood bootstraps)
at the base. This clade is sister to a clade containing PAPRs,
the relationship of all being moderately well-supported
(82 maximum likelihood bootstraps). Despite the lack of
the Cys pairs for binding an FeS cluster, all of the enzymes
within this clade are most likely to reduce APS rather than
PAPS because, firstly, this has been demonstrated in P.
patens and S. lepidophylla [8], secondly, as mentioned
above, high APR activity has been measured in the chromist algae and lastly, the fusion of H. triquetra enzyme
with ATPS indicates channeling of APS to its active centre.
Still, detailed biochemical analysis of these proteins is
needed to answer the question of substrate specificity unequivocally.
Two possibilities to explain this distribution exist. Firstly,
the cyanobacterial ancestor of primary plastids contained
APR, whereas the host that engulfed it possessed PAPR.
The PAPS dependent enzyme changed its substrate specificity to APS and was then lost independently, a minimum
of four times in rhodophytes, chlorophytes (after the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/39

branching of streptophytes), streptophytes (after the
branching of bryophytes and lycopodiophytes leaving
only APR in spermophytes) and in the chromalveolates/
rhizarians, which comprise the rest of the clade. The second, more parsimonious explanation is a lateral gene
transfer at the base of streptophytes from an alga with a
secondary plastid, and the subsequent loss after the divergence of lycopodiophytes. This transfer would have had to
happen after the change of substrate specificity. Better
sampling of early diverging streptophytes might help to
distinguish these possibilities, however, the strongly supported position of the mosses between the dinoflagellates
and chromist (and chlorarachniophyte) algae, most
strongly supports the latter.
The isoform of APS-reductase found in the chlorarachniophyte by B. natans is specifically related to those from chromist algae. The close association of chlorachniophytes
and stramenopiles, both at the host level and by frequent
lateral transfers between the two, has previously been
noted [47-49].
Sulfite Reductase
Sulfite and nitrite reductases are closely related proteins
that are capable of reducing the reciprocal substrate, albeit
at lower efficiency [1]. It is not always possible to conclude if an unknown sequence is a sulfite or nitrite reductase from primary sequence analyses such as BLAST.
Therefore, to ensure the correct identification of new isoforms, such as that from E. gracilis, it was prudent to
include both enzymes in the analysis. Since the subject of
this manuscript is sulfate assimilation comments are limited to the SiR clade, which resolved with 100% bootstrap
support (Figure 5).

All of the aplastidic eukaryotes which encode SiR showed
a specific and well-supported relationship. This clade was
sister to the CysI subunit of SiR from various proteobacteria. The SiR of cyanobacteria on the other hand showed
closer relationship to plastid-containing eukaryotes. This
division of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in Figure 5, rather
than the separation of the two groups, suggests that all
eukaryote SiRs are either of prokaryotic origin, inherited
from the progenitors of the mitochondrion and/or plastid, or that lateral gene transfers have occurred. While the
plastidial isoforms of SiR show strong relationships to
cyanobacteria, the tree does not specifically support a
mitochondrial origin for those found in aplastidic eukaryotes, although it is not ruled out.
The SiR encoded in E. gracilis showed no relationship to
plastidial isoforms or to those from other eukaryotes,
instead it branched at the base of the SiR clade. Although
its position could be due to being derived, it could also
indicate the only remaining eukaryotic isoform. Since no

other sulfate assimilation genes were found among excavate sequences it is not possible to confirm whether this is
the case. The tree supports neither a plastidial nor mitochondrial origin nor yet acquirement by lateral transfer.
However, there is no evidence of a eukaryotic origin of
either sulfite- or nitrite-reductases.
Gene replacement from endosymbiont and retargeting of
two enzymes in Euglena
The closest relatives of Euglena for which there is sequence
data are the kinetoplasts. The complete genomes of
Trypanosoma spp. and Leishmania spp., however, do not
contain the enzymes for the reduction of sulfate. Euglena
species differ from their closest relatives in that they contain a secondary plastid of green algal origin [50].

The ATPS encoded by E. gracilis is, along with other
known enzymes of the pathway, preceded by a presequence that suggests a mitochondrial location (Figure
2). Indeed, sulfate reduction activity in the mitochondria
has been shown in this species [19,21]. The phylogenetic
position within the algal-plastid (including chlorophyte)
clade, makes a plastid origin (and therefore subsequent
retargeting to mitochondria) of the enzyme most likely.
However, as discussed above, the origin of this isoform in
green algae is unclear. A plastid origin for the APR
encoded by E. gracilis is also supported, with the enzyme
being related to that found in the Archaeplastidal lineage,
although the relationship to chlorophytes is not specifically supported. The origin of the third enzyme in the
pathway, SiR, however, could not be determined, but very
it is likely it is to be different from the ATPS and APR. Plastid localized sulfite reductase is ferredoxin dependent,
whereas in Euglena sulfite reduction does not require
ferredoxin and is thus most probably NADPH dependent
[19]. The location of SiR in mitochondria suggests that the
enzyme may be coupled to the unusual pyruvate:NADP+
oxidoreductase, an ancient enzyme involved in oxidative
decarboxylation of pyruvate [26]. This would explain not
only the localization of SiR but also the rationale for
Euglena not retaining and retargeting the protein inherited
from its secondary plastid.
Although the full genomic sequence of Euglena is lacking,
we can surmise that after the secondary endosymbiosis
and subsequent relocation of genetic material to the host,
the enzymes for ATPS and APR were re-targeted to the
mitochondria, rather than to the compartment that they
were inherited from and, likely, replaced the hostencoded genes. Because of lack of information on related
host cells, it is unknown if the host reduced sulfur in the
mitochondria prior to this event. Regardless, the location
of the pathway in this cellular compartment raises some
interesting biochemical questions. This localization of
sulfate reducing centre ensures an effective provision of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/39

reduced sulfur to the cytosol and mitochondria, as demonstrated by the incorporation of the label from [35S] to
free cysteine and proteins, respectively [21]. However,
transport processes to import the reduced sulfur compounds to plastids are still necessary. This leads to the
question does the mitochondrial location in Euglenids
provide a more efficient ATP production and/or reducing
capacity than it would in the plastid? And, if so, why? The
answer may lie in understanding whether the mechanism
of sulfate reduction in Euglena is the same as in other plastid containing eukaryotes. A detailed analysis of purified
APR from Euglena revealed that the enzyme forms a reaction intermediate where sulfate from APS is covalently
attached to a Cys residue of the protein, similar as in
higher plant APR [51,52]. However, part of the sulfate is
bound to a thiol-containing low molecular weight carrier,
which does not seem to play any role in plant APR reaction [51,52]. As Euglena possesses a thiosulfonate reductase [19] the bound-sulfite pathway of sulfate assimilation,
as previously proposed [53] may still exist in this species.
The availability of the molecular tools will allow these
intriguing questions to be addressed in the future.

Conclusion
The inheritance of ATPS is complex, with multiple origins
in the lineages that comprise the opisthokonts, different
isoforms in chlorophytes and streptophytes, independent
gene fusions in two species with other enzymes of the
pathway, evidence of a eukaryote to prokaryote lateral
gene transfer and two reversals of cellular location of hostand endosymbiont-originating enzymes. The evolution of
APR and the related PAPR appears equally notable with
evidence of lateral gene transfers and a recently described
novel isoforms of APR from Bryophytes being more
related to PAPRs found in fungi and bacteria than to the
higher plant APRs indicating a change of substrate specificity during evolution.
We also found that the APTS and APR active in the mitochondria of Euglena were inherited from the secondary
green algal plastid. We therefore confirmed the plastid
localization of APR in chloroplasts of C. reinhardtii suggesting that in Euglena the proteins were retargeted to the
mitochondria after the secondary endosymbiosis. Euglena
SiR, on the other hand, is less related to plastidial isoforms and may be of host origin. Since all other eukaryotic
lineages appear to encode isoforms inherited from either
the mitochondrial or plastid endosymbiont origins, it
might be the only known isoform of host origin. The
many distinct isoforms of the three enzymes identified
here represent an excellent resource for future studies

Methods
Immunolocalization of APR and SiR in Chlamydomonas
Fixed C. reinhardtii cells embedded in LR-Gold medium
were kindly received from Peter Beech, Deakin University,
Australia. Briefly, these cells were fixed with 0.75% glutaraldehyde in 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), ethanol dehydrated
and embedded in LR-Gold resin. After sectioning, cells
were blocked with 0.1% BSA and 0.001% Tween 40 in 1×
PBS for one hour. Antibodies raised in rabbit against
recombinant Arabidopsis thaliana APR2 or SIR [54], which
identified single bands in C. reinhardtii protein extracts by
Western blotting (Additional File 1), were applied for two
hours at 25°C at 1:4000 (APR) and 1:2000 (SiR) dilutions. Following four five-minute washes in blocking
buffer, secondary antibodies conjugated to 18 nm gold
particles were applied overnight at 4°C, washed as before,
and then stained with uranyl acetate for 60 seconds. As a
control, sections were blocked and incubated with secondary antibodies only. Sections were viewed with a
Philips CM120 BioTWIN transmission electron microscope. Particles of label were counted from three 1 μm2
areas from three area of the cell (pyrenoid and starch
sheath, chloroplast excluding pyrenoid and starch sheath,
outside of chloroplast) from three cells, for each antibody
(APR and SiR) and negative control (secondary antibody
only). The results are given in Additional File 2.
Sequence identification
Genomes were searched by systematic BLAST comparisons to proteins from A. thaliana and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. N-terminal targeting sequences given in Table 1 were
predicted using iPSORT [55] and TargetP [56]. Sequences
from Homo sapiens, Dictyostelium discodium, Emiliania huxleyi, S. cerevisiae, Aspergillus nidulans, Oryza sativa and
Selaginella moellendorffii were obtained from NCBI
sequence repository. Sequences from Phytophthora sojae,
Thalassiosira pseudonana, C. reinhardtii, Ostreococcus tauri,
Osterococcus lucimarinus and Physcomitrella patens were
obtained from the Joint Genome Institute data repository
[57]. Sequences from Cyanidioschyzon merolae were
obtained from the C. merolae genome project [58].
Sequences from Toxoplasma gondii were obtained from
ToxoDB [59]. Sequences from other, incomplete genomes
used in phylogenetic analysis were obtained by BLAST
comparisons to the protein and EST databases at NCBI.
Sequences from E. gracilis and Bigelowiella natans were
obtained from the tbEST database [60]. An incomplete
expressed sequence tag clone of APR from E. gracilis was
sequenced to completion and deposited in GenBank
under accession number EU131629.

dataset for phylogenetic analyses, otherwise the complete
proteins were used for analysis. The final matrix size for
APR and PAPR was 63 × 168; for ATPS it was 64 × 300; for
SiR and NiR 62 × 387. The alignment data are provided in
Additional File 3.
Protein maximum-likelihood analyses were performed
using PhyML [62] with the WAG model of amino acids
substitution, proportion of variable rates estimated from
the data, and nine categories of substitution rates. 100
bootstrap trees were calculated with PhyML, also with
nine rates categories. Bayesian trees were estimated by
MrBayes version 3.1c using the WAG model with amongsite rate variation modelled by a four discrete rates
approximation of a gamma distribution. Four independent chains with random starting trees were run for 1 000
000 generations, samples were taken every five hundredth
generation and the first 200 sampled trees were discarded
as burn-in.
For distance analyses, gamma-corrected distances were
calculated by PUZZLE using the WAG substitution matrix
with eight variable rate categories and invariable sites.
Trees were inferred by weighted neighbor-joining using
WEIGHBOR and FITCH. Bootstrap resampling was performed using PUZZLEBOOT with rates and frequencies
estimated using PUZZLE. Both distance trees gave the
same topologies at supported nodes as maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.
