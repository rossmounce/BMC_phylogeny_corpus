Abstract
Background: Nucleotide sequences and the gene arrangements of mitochondrial genomes are effective
tools for resolving phylogenetic problems. Hemipteroid insects are known to possess highly reorganized
mitochondrial genomes, but in the suborder Heteroptera (Insecta: Hemiptera), there was only one
complete mitochondrial genome sequenced without gene rearrangement and the phylogeny of infraorder
Pentatomomorpha in Heteroptera was still uncertain.
Results: Fifteen mitochondrial genomes of the suborder Heteroptera were sequenced. Gene
rearrangements were found as follows: 1) tRNA-I and tRNA-Q switched positions in Aradidae, 2) tRNA-T
and tRNA-P switched positions in Largidae and Pyrrhocoridae. Two recombination events were found in
Alydidae and Malcidae. The other mt-genomes were organized in the same way as observed in Drosophila
yakuba. The phylogenetic analyses of infraorder Pentatomomorpha based on the nucleotide sequence
raised the hypothesis of (Aradoidea + (Pentatomoidea + (Pyrrhocoroidea + (Lygaeoidea + Coreoidea)))).
The rearrangement of tRNA-T and tRNA-P also linked Largidae and Pyrrhocoridae together. Furthermore,
the conserved sequence block in the unusual intergenic spacers between tRNA-H and ND4 favored the
monophyly of Lygaeoidea. Tetranucleotide ATCA was inferred to be the initiation codon of ND2 in
Cydnidae. No correlation was found between the rates of nucleotide substitution and gene
rearrangement. CG content was significantly correlated with the nucleotide substitution rate of each gene.
For ND1, there was a positive correlation (P < 0.01) between amino acids variations and hydrophobicity,
but a negative correlation (P < 0.01) for ND6. No conserved sequence was found among the control
regions and these regions were not always the most AT-rich region of the mt-genome.
Conclusion: Heteropteran insects are extremely complex groups worthy of further study because of the
unusual tetranucleotide initiation codon and their great mt-genomic diversity, including gene
rearrangements and recombinations. The mt-genome is a powerful molecular marker for resolving
phylogeny at the level of the superfamily and family. Gene rearrangements were not correlated with
nucleotide substitution rates. CG content variation caused the different evolutionary patterns among
genes. For ND1, in many polar or nonpolar regions the specific identity of the amino acid residues might
be more important than maintaining the polarity of these regions, while the opposite is true for ND6. Most
sequences of the control regions did not appear to be important for regulatory functions. Finally, we
suggest that the term "AT-rich regions" should not be used.

Background
To date, more than one hundred complete or nearly complete insect mitochondrial genomes (mt-genomes) and
thousands of partial sequences are available in GenBank/
EMBL/DDBJ, and the data set is expanding at an increasing pace. Most animal mt-genomes contain the same 37
genes, but the orders of the genes are variable among and
within the major groups [1]. The mt-genome is becoming
an effective tool to resolve phylogenetic problems due to
its unique properties, including maternal inheritance,
orthologous genes, and lack of the substantial intermolecular recombination [2]. Patterns of mitochondrial gene
rearrangements are also indicators of phylogenetic relationships [3-5]
In Insecta, mitochondrial gene rearrangements have been
found in 11 orders (including some unpublished data)
with the others exhibiting the same gene order observed
in Drosophila yakuba [6,7]. It has been found that the
hemipteroid insects (including four orders, Hemiptera,
Thysanoptera, Psocoptera, and Phthiraptera) have experienced increased rates of gene rearrangements in the mtgenomes [8-12]. In the order Phthiraptera, the three
sequenced mt-genomes [GenBank: NC002651, GenBank:
NC009983, GenBank: NC007884] show different gene
arrangements. Within the suborder Sternorrhyncha of
order Hemiptera, six of the eight sequenced mt-genomes
[GenBank: NC005939, GenBank: NC006159, GenBank:
NC006160, GenBank: NC006292, GenBank: NC006279,
GenBank: NC006280] experienced gene rearrangements
and are different from each other. But within the suborder
Heteroptera of order Hemiptera, the gene order of the
only sequenced mt-genome, Triatoma dimidiata (Latreille,
1811) (Reduviidae) [GenBank: NC002609], is identical to
that of Drosophila yakuba [GenBank: NC001322].
It has been proposed that such gene rearrangements as
synapomorphies would not contribute much to resolving
insect interordinal relationships, while using gene order
to understand intraordinal relationships would be useful
[6]. We undertook to examine whether the gene arrangements are conservative in suborder Heteroptera, especially
in the infraorder Pentatomomorpha, to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships within this group and determine
whether the gene order could resolve the phylogenetic
relationships at the superfamily level.
Pentatomomorpha is one of six infraorders of Heteroptera
[13]. It consists chiefly of terrestrial phytophagous bugs.
Many of these bugs feed on seeds and plant vascular systems and some feed on fungi. This group of insects is economically important in agriculture and forestry, making
robust phylogenetic hypotheses for the main lineages of
significant interest. Views on the systematics of Pentatomomorpha before 1993 were summarized by Schaefer

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/610

(1993) [14]. Currently the classification system of Pentatomomorpha includes five superfamilies, Aradoidea,
Pentatomoidea, Coreoidea, Lygaeoidea and Pyrrhocoroidea (the superfamilies except the Aradoidea are grouped
as Trichophora) [15]. There are different views of the phylogenetic relationships within Pentatomomorpha based
on morphological or molecular evidence. Using morphological evidence, Schaefer (1993) argued that Aradoidea
may be either the sister group of Trichophora or Cimicomorpha-cum-Pentatomomorpha [14]. Sweet (1996) proposed that the Aradoidea constituted a separate
heteropteran infraorder, Aradomorpha [16]. Henry
(1997) suggested the relationship (Aradoidea + (Pentatomoidea + ((Coreoidea + Pyrrhocoroidea) + (Idiostoloidea
+ Lygaeoidea)))) [17]. Using molecular evidence, Xie et al
(2005) performed Bayesian analysis with the 18S rDNA
data set on the main lineages of Trichophora, giving the
hypothesis of (Pentatomoidea + (Pyrrhocoroidea + (Coreoidea + Lygaeoidea))) and raised the taxon Eutrichophora
(including the superfamilies of Trichophora except Pentatomoidea) and Neotrichophora (including Coreoidea
and Lygaeoidea), but the relationships within the Neotrichophora were not completely resolved [18]. Li et al.
(2005) proposed the hypothesis that (Aradoidea + (Pentatomoidea + ("Pyrrhocoroidea"+ "Coreoidea" + "Lygaeoidea"))) based on the partial sequence of the CO1 and
18S rDNA [19]. Li et al. (2005), however, found that the
superfamilies Pyrrhocoroidea, Coreoidea, and Lygaeoidea
were not monophyletic. However, Li et al. (2005)
included several low quality sequences with many ambiguous nucleotides and a lack of subregions, and two CO1like genes were used instead of the CO1 gene; also, many
nodes in the cladogram appeared with bootstrap values
lower than 50%. Additionally, Wheeler et al (1993) supported the monophyly of Pentatomomorpha and a sister
group relationship between Aradoidea and Trichophora
based on evidence combining morphological characters
and partial 18S rDNA [20].
To date, the hypothesis (Aradoidea + (Pentatomoidea +
the remainder of Trichophora)) has been accepted by
most researchers, based on morphological and molecular
evidence [17-19,21]. Within Pentatomomorpha, especially the Eutrichophora, the phylogenetic relationships
among the superfamilies are still controversial.
For a robust phylogenetic hypothesis of the higher-level
relationships in any organism, multiple genes and large
sequence lengths are favored [22-24]. However, the DNA
sequences that have been used for phylogenetic analyses
of Pentatomomorpha are no longer than 1.6 kb. Thus we
hoped to resolve the phylogeny of Pentatomomorpha
with the mt-genomes, which are the largest set of homologous genes that can be conveniently compared across

animal taxa [6]. No bioinformatic studies on the mtgenomes of Pentatomomorpha have been done.
Recombination has been considered to be absent in the
animal mt-genome [25], but recombination has been
observed in insect mtDNA [26]. There are different views
on whether the nucleotide substitution rate correlates
with gene rearrangements [27-29].
We sequenced the mt-genomes of 15 heteropterans in this
study with five main aims: 1) to explore the organization
of their mt-genomes and infer possible evolutionary
mechanisms; 2) to find out whether there is recombination in heteropteran mt-genomes; 3) to investigate the
phylogenetic relationships among the superfamilies of
Pentatomomorpha; 4) to identify the correlation between
the nucleotide substitution rate and gene rearrangement;
5) to describe the bioinformatics of heteropteran mtgenomes.

Saldidae and Alydidae, long intergenic spacers were found
between tRNA-I and tRNA-Q (79 nt in Saldidae, 238 nt in
Alydidae) but without any CSB.
In type B, Aradidae, the tRNA-Q translocated from the
inferred ancestral position (tRNA-I-and-tRNA-Q-andtRNA-M) to upstream of the tRNA-I with a 44 nt spacer
which could be folded as a stem-loop structure between
them.
In most of the sequenced mt-genomes of heteropterans,
tRNA-T and tRNA-P form a concatenated unit and locate
upstream to ND6 gene. But in Type C, Pyrrhocoroidea
(including Largidae and Pyrrhocoridae), tRNA-T and
tRNA-P switched their positions with two extra intergenic
spacers in different locations. In Largidae, the spacers are
19 nt between ND4L and tRNA-P, and 240 nt between
tRNA-T and ND6. In Pyrrhocoridae, the spacers are 33 nt
between ND4L and tRNA-P, and 60 nt between tRNA-P
and tRNA-T.

Results and discussion
A total of 10 complete and 5 nearly complete mt-genomes
were sequenced and have been deposited in GenBank
(Table 1).
Genome Organization
Within these genomes, all of the 37 genes commonly
found in metazoan mt-genomes were determined: 2 for
rRNAs, 22 for tRNAs, and 13 for proteins. Most of these
genes are arranged in the same order as the putative ancestral insect mt-genome [30], with a few exceptions discussed later. We also found both intergenic spacers and
genes that overlapped by several nucleotides. For discussion purposes, the strand containing the CO1 gene was
designated as the major-strand (J-strand) because it
encoded 23 genes. Consequently the other strand encoding the remaining 14 genes was designated as the minorstrand (N-strand).

Finally, the mt-genomes of heteropterans in this study
were classified into three types (A-C) (Table 1 and Figure
1). Because we selected one exemplar species for each representative heteropteran family, the family names are
used instead of the species names in the following discussion. Thirteen of the sixteen mt-genomes were classified as
type A, with the most common gene arrangement, which
contained the identical gene order as the putative ancestral insect mt-genome [30]. Among all the bugs of Lygaeoidea in this study, long intergenic spacers were detected
between tRNA-H and ND4 (38 nt in Berytidae, 40 nt in
Malcidae, 72 nt in Colobathristidae, and 124 nt in Geocoridae), which contained a conserved sequence block
(CSB) (Figure 2A) that might indicate that the members of
Lygaeoidea underwent a common intermediate stage of
tandem duplication and random loss (TDRL) [4,31]. In

Furthermore, the intergenic spacer between tRNA-S (TGA)
and ND1 occurs in all the mt-genomes except Pyrrhocoridae. All these spacers are no longer than 30 nt except
Reduviidae which is longer than 300 nt. Some of these
spacers may be folded as stem-loop structures, and in
Reduviidae this spacer contains an unidentified open
reading frame of 312 nt [32]. Among these spacers, there
is a CSB (Figure 2B), which might indicate that the extant
heteropterans underwent a common intermediate stage of
the TDRL process, i.e., this spacer might be a synapomorphy of heteropterans.
Possible evolutionary mechanisms of gene rearrangement
The translocated tRNAs in Aradidae, Largidae, and Pyrrhocoridae have not changed their transcription direction.
Although it is unknown what really happened to these mtgenomes causing the gene rearrangements and intergenic
insertions, we tried to elucidate the possible evolutionary
mechanisms using the most commonly supposed model
for the gene rearrangements, including gene tandem
duplication and random loss [4,31]. The possible mechanism of position switch of tRNA-T and tRNA-P in Largidae
and Pyrrhocoridae is shown in Figure 3. The TDRL shown
from Figure 3A (ancestral state) to Figure 3C (Largidae)
and Figure 3D (Pyrrhocoridae) might include several different pathways. For example, the duplication of the
Dup.2 is not necessary to produce Figure 3C and the Dup.3
is not necessary to Figure 3D, i.e., Largidae and Pyrrhocoridae might have been formed separately. However,
because convergent rearrangements are rare in mtgenomes [33], and Largidae and Pyrrhocoridae are
grouped as the monophyletic superfamily Pyrrhocoroidea
(discussed later), these two rearrangements of tRNA-T and
tRNA-P are speculated to be the products of the same

intermediate and they are synapomorphies of the members of Pyrrhocoroidea. The translocation of the tRNA-Q
in Aradidae could be elucidated with the same model.
Recombination of mitochondrial DNA
In Alydidae, two subregions of the intergenic spacer
between the tRNA-I and the tRNA-Q have a repeated
counterpart (29 nt, with one site mutation, Blast E-value:
3e-9) and an exactly inverted repeated counterpart (26 nt,
Blast E-value: 8e-10) in the control region (Figure 4A) (see

Additional file 1). Since the TDRL model would only produce tandem duplications [34], these two repetitions are
supposed to be formed by the TDRL following an intramitochondrial recombination [35] as shown in Figure 4A.
In Malcidae, one subregion of the intergenic spacer
between the tRNA-H and the ND4 has an exactly repeated
counterpart in the control region (34 nt, Blast E-value: 2e15) (see Additional file 1), and this subregion is also part
of the CSB in Lygaeoidea. Considering that this intergenic

code for the specified amino acid. The underlined genes were encoded on the N-strand.

spacer is shared among the members of Lygaeoidea, in
Malcidae the copy of the repetition located between
tRNA-H and ND4 is supposed to be the original one. This
phenomenon could also be elucidated by the TDRL
model wherein a large fragment from the intergenic
spacer to the control region duplicated and then most of
them were lost except the repetition. However, across the
whole mt-genome, no vestige of such a large duplication
was found. The possible alternative mechanism is recombination. It has been reported that the secondary structures formed by the tRNA genes or the self complementary
sequences may play a major role as the hotspots in recombination [36,37], and the control region is supposed to be
a possible recombination hotspot [27]. Interestingly, this
intergenic spacer in Malcidae is capable of forming a stemloop structure (see Additional file 1) adjacent to tRNA-H,
and its repetition in the stem-loop-rich control region is
adjacent to tRNA-I. So, we speculated that this duplication
might be the product of illegitimate recombination via a
mini-circle (Figure 4B). However, in Berytidae, no copy of
this spacer was found across the mt-genomes. Further
study is needed to investigate whether this repetition is
the autapomorphy of Malcidae, since the control regions
of Geocoridae and Colobathristidae could not be
sequenced because of poly A and poly T.
Use of the tRNAs in phylogenetic analysis
The transfer RNA gene recruitment or the duplication and
the remolding make it hard to identify the homologs for
these short genes and could also affect the use of mitochondrial gene orders for the phylogenetic reconstruc-

tions [38,39]. It has also been proposed that the tRNAs are
much less homoplastic than the PCGs and should be
included in the phylogenetic analyses [6]. Thus, it is necessary to understand whether the tRNA genes are
homologs before the phylogenetic analyses.
For the 22 tRNAs, each type holds the same anticodon
respectively across the mt-genomes in this study. We
aligned each type of tRNA and adjusted them according to
their secondary structures (the alignments are the same as
those used in phylogenetic analyses), and then the pairwise similarities within each type of tRNA were calculated
by pairwise alignment using BioEdit (see Additional file
2). High similarity values could found within each type of
the tRNAs, indicating that no tRNA recruitment or
remolding [38,39] happened and the rearrangements of
the tRNAs in Aradidae, Largidae, and Pyrrhocoridae
should be the transpositions of the tRNA coding
sequences. Finally, we determined that each group of
tRNAs used in the phylogenetic analyses are homologous.
Phylogeny of Pentatomomorpha
The N123RT data set contained 15322 nucleotides sites
and the N12 data set contained 7516 nucleotides sites for
each of the 16 taxa. Finally, all four phylogenetic analyses
conducted with Bayesian inference and ML received fully
bifurcating trees with the same topology rooted with Saldidae (Figure 5). All the superfamilies established previously in Pentatomomorpha are well recognized.
Significantly, our results support the hypothesis that Pentatomoidea, Pyrrhocoroidea, Lygaeoidea, and Coreoidea

are monophyletic groups. Though only one species was
chosen in Aradoidea, up to now no one has challenged
the monophyly of Aradoidea [17].
Our results also confirm that Aradoidea and the Trichophora are sister groups as indicated in previous studies
[17-19,21]. Hence, we argue that there is no necessity to
raise Aradoidea from a superfamily to an infraorder,
because the seven-infraorder classification of the Heteroptera has been accepted by most researchers [15,20]. The
sister groups' relationship of Pentatomoidea and the
remainder of the Trichophora raised in this study also
conforms to the morphological and nuclear rDNA data
[17,18]. In Eutrichophora, our study raises a phylogenetic
hypothesis of (Pyrrhocoroidea + (Lygaeoidea + Coreoidea)). This result is different from Henry (1997) [17] but
similar to Xie et al (2005) [18]. Since this study did not

include all the families of each superfamily, family relationships within each superfamily, remain incomplete.
The Rhophalidae presents a sister position to the (Coreidae+Alydidae) and the monophyly of the (Coreidae+Alydidae) is also accepted by Henry (1997) [17] and Xie et al
(2005) [18]. In Lygaeoidea, our conclusion is (Colobathristidae + (Berytidae + (Geocoridae + Malcidae))), which
is different from Henry (1997) [17], whose hypothesis
could be summarized as (Geocoridae + (Malcidae +
(Colobathristidae + Berytidae))). The monophyletic malcid line [17,40] is broken down in our study because of
the interposition of Geocoridae.
Surprisingly, the infraorder Cimicomorpha (including
Reduviidae, Anthocoridae, and other families not
included in this study), whose monophyly has been
accepted [20,41], was not monophyletic in this study. The

present significantly different substitution rates from each
other. However, for tRNA-I, Largidae and Pyrrhocoridae,
whose tRNA-Is do not translocate, present significantly
different substitution rates, but not the Aradidae. Interestingly, among all the tRNA-P, Pyrrhocoridae is the most
TA-skewed and GC-skewed, and among all the tRNA-T,
Largidae is the most AT-skewed and CG-skewed (Table 3).
Further studies are needed to say why these two tRNA
genes present different substitution patterns from their
homologues and whether the increased mutations are
accumulated before or after the rearrangements

regions. The X in B indicates the randomly lost regions.

Bayesian posterior probability value for the node
(Anthocoridae + Pentatomomorpha) is 1.00. The mtgenome data in this study may be too limited to resolve
the phylogeny of Cimicomorpha, and more mt-genomes
of the additional taxa of Cimicomorpha need to be
sequenced because increased taxon sampling could
greatly reduce the phylogenetic error [42], or possibly the
monophyly of Cimicomorpha needs to be revised.
Additionally, in Lygaeoidea the CSB in the intergenic
spacers between tRNA-H and ND4 indicates that the
members of Lygaeoidea have undergone a common intermediate TDRL and this spacer is the synapomorphy of
Lygaeoidea favoring its monophyly. Furthermore, the
position switch of tRNA-T and tRNA-P also links Largidae
and Pyrrhocoridae together.
Correlation between rates of nucleotide substitution and
gene rearrangement
It has been found that the substitution rate is not relevant
to the frequent gene rearrangements in the pond-breeding
mantellids [27]. However, a positive correlation has been
demonstrated in the arthropod taxa [28,29]. To find this
correlation in Pentatomomorpha, the relative nucleotide
substitution rates were tested among three groups: 1) Aradidae, whose tRNA-I and tRNA-Q switched positions; 2)
Largidae and Pyrrhocoridae, whose tRNA-T and tRNA-P
switched positions; and 3) the remainder of Pentatomomorpha (Table 2). For tRNA-Q, Aradidae has a significantly different substitution rate from other two groups.
For tRNA-P, Largidae and Pyrrhocoridae have significantly
different substitution rates. For tRNA-T, the three groups

In general, the groups whose genes rearranged do not
always exhibit significantly different substitution rates.
So, there is no correlation between the rates of nucleotide
substitution and gene rearrangement.
Different evolutionary patterns among genes
The nucleotide substitution rates averaged over all
sequence pairs of each gene vary among genes (see Additional file 3A). The overall mean value of this ratio of each
pair of PCGs is 0.639, while for the rRNAs it is 0.384. Furthermore, the concatenated 22 tRNAs present a lower ratio
(0.241) than PCGs and rRNAs, as reported before [43].
This is a reasonable result because the purifying selection
constrains nucleotide divergence in the rRNAs and the
tRNAs due to the secondary structures of these molecules
and the specificity of their amino acid binding sites during
the translation [44]. ND6 presents the highest nucleotide
substitution rate, while CO1 appears to be the lowest. Surprisingly, CO2, which is considered as one of the slowest
evolving genes [45], presents a higher nucleotide substitution ratio than most of the PCGs. As shown in Additional
file 3A, the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site of CO2 is the highest, but its number of
nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site is
much lower, while this value for ATP8 is the highest. As far
as the PCGs are concerned, at the amino acid level the
cytochrome oxidase subunits (CO1, CO2, and CO3) and
cytochrome b are the slowest evolving proteins and ATP8
is the fastest. The nucleotide substitution rates of the first
and second codon positions of PCGs are always lower but
more variable within each gene than the third codon positions (see Additional file 3B), which is most likely because
of the different selective constraints on the different genes
[46]. Obviously, for PCGs the ratios of the nonsynonymous nucleotide changes (Ka) versus the synonymous
nucleotide changes (Ks) are all below 1, indicating that
they are evolving according to the purifying selection [47].

Negative correlations have been found between the nucleotide substitution rate and the CG content of each gene (P
< 0.01), and between the Ka/Ks and the CG content of
each PCG (P < 0.01), which indicate that the variation of
CG content causes the different evolutionary patterns

Codon usage and nucleotide composition
Most of the PCGs in the mt-genomes of heteropterans are
initiated with the common triplet initiation codons as
shown in the invertebrate mitochondrial genetic code
table. However, in mt-genomes of insects, atypical initiation codons are not rare, e.g., the tetranucleotide TTAG
serves as the initiation codon for Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) [49], and ATAA, GTAA, TTAA for Drosophila (Diptera: Drosophilidae) [7,50-52]. In Cydnidae,
ND2 was supposed to be initiated with an atypical initiation codon, ATCA, based on the alignments with the other
heteropterans (Figure 6).

among genes. For ND1, there is positive correlation (P <
0.01) between the variations and the hydrophobicity of
the amino acids, but negative correlation (P < 0.01) for
ND6, indicating that, in many polar or nonpolar regions,
the specific identify of amino acid residues may be more
important than maintaining the polarity of these regions
of ND1, while the opposite is true for ND6, as reported in
other organisms [48].

Some PCGs do not possess complete stop codons but
appear to be terminated with a single T adjacent to a
downstream tRNA gene on the same strand (data not
shown, see the GenBank files under the Accession Numbers in Table 1). This is not peculiar the in mt-genome and
a TAA stop codon is probably generated by posttranscriptional polyadenylation [53]. RNase P has been found to
take on some aspects of the structural conformation of the
tRNAs for the recognition signals of the cleavage sites in
the tRNA precursors, rather than the nucleotide sequences
[53]. Thus, we supposed that the site right before tRNA
should be the cleavage site. However, the complete common stop codons always overlap several nucleotides
within the downstream tRNA, which perhaps act as a
"backup" to prevent the translational read through if the
transcripts are not properly cleaved [54].
In Heteroptera, the nucleotide compositions are biased
toward adenines and thymines (68.86% to 77.8% of A+T)
(Table 1). The nucleotide skew statistics [55] of J-strands
indicate that the heteropterans are AT-skewed and CGskewed (Table 4). Although several mt-genomes are not
completely sequenced, these skew trends are obvious. The
skew statistics of the total PCGs demonstrate that the Nstrand PCGs are GC-skewed and much more TA-skewed
while the J-strand PCGs are CG-skewed and consist of
nearly equal A and T. It is possible that the overall genome
A-bias is driven by mutational pressure on the N-strand
[56] and the GC-skew may be correlated with the asymmetric replication process of the mtDNA [45].
Because there are only 22 tRNA genes in one mt-genome,
one tRNA must recognize more than one type of codon.
However, the most frequent codons do not always correspond with their cognates in the mitochondrial tRNAs
(see Additional file 4). It appears that the recognition of
the cognates between the anticodons and the codons is
not related to translation efficiency. Furthermore, the
most infrequently used fourfold degenerate codons are
NNG, which is because in the oxidative conditions of the
mitochondria, the low content of the less stable G acts on

ture with an extremely short DHU stem and a small loop.
It has been supposed that these characteristics in mtgenome are partly because the mtDNA is not subject to
the process of recombination, which may facilitate the
elimination of deleterious mutations [59]. However,
recombination in insect mtDNA has been observed [26].
It is not known whether the aberrant tRNAs lose their
function in every case, but there are reports of the recruitment of nuclear tRNAs into the mitochondria [60,61],
and a type of RNA editing could recover the well-paired
acceptor stem [62].
Since it is impossible to precisely determine the ends of
rRNA genes by DNA sequence alone, they were assumed
to extend to the boundaries of flanking genes [3,54]. So
the lrRNA was assumed to fill up the blanks between
tRNA-V and tRNA-L (TAG). For the boundary between the
srRNA gene and the non-coding putative control region,
alignments with homologous sequences in other insect
mt-genomes were applied to define the 5'-end of the gene
[11,63,64].

the base composition of the mRNAs to preserve their life
span, rather than the DNA [57]. Overall, the most frequently used codons are NNA, which could be explained
by the hypothesis put forward by Xia (1996)[71] that ATP
is much more abundant than the other three ribonucleotides in mitochondria, and the most frequently used
ribonucleotide at the third codon positions in the mRNA
should be the same as the most abundant ribonucleotide
in the cellular matrix where the mRNA is transcribed [58].
tRNAs and rRNAs
Based on the DNA sequences, most of the tRNAs could be
folded as cloverleaf secondary structures. A few of them
possessed non-Watson-Crick matches, aberrant loops, or
even extremely short arms. Most of the tRNA-S (GCT) lost
their DHU arms, which is not rare in insect mt-genomes.
In some cases, the alternative folding could yield a struc-

Noncoding sequences
Sizes of the complete mt-genomes of Heteroptera range
from 14935 bp (Largidae) to 17191 bp (Alydidae) (Table
1). Total length of tRNAs, rRNAs, and PCGs of each mtgenome does not vary too much in this study, ranging
from 14399 bp (Malcidae) to 14687 bp (Aradidae) (Table
4). So the variety of mt-genome size is mainly derived
from the non-coding regions. Among these mt-genomes,
some large intergenic spacers (the control regions located
between srRNA and tRNA-I are not included) could be
folded as stem-loop structures which may be potential
control elements, and several short ORFs could be found
with no significant similarity to any known insect proteins. Since mt-genomes without these "control elements"
or "proteins" could still preserve their life, these spacers
were supposed to be vestiges of their common or their
own ancestral intermediates generated by gene duplication-random loss process of rearrangement, so were the
other short spacers.

As summarized by Cook (2005), the putative control
regions of the arthropods often have any or all of these
four motifs: a long sequence of thymines, tandemly
repeated sequences, a subregion of even higher A+T content, and stem-loop structures [65]. Among the 11 complete mt-genomes of heteropterans, lengths of the control
regions range from 224 bp (Largidae) to 2400 bp (Alydidae) (Table 4). Besides the stretches of thymines in all of
them, only some short tandemly repeated sequences
could be found in several of the mt-genomes, such as the
(TA)6 in Saldidae, the (TTGA)3 in Aradidae, the (AAATC)2
in Coreidae, and the (TTAA)3 twice separately in Malcidae.
Interestingly, Alydidae, whose control region is the long-

est one in this study, had only several short tandemly
repeated sequences no longer than 11 bp (see Additional
file 5). In Reduviidae [32], Berytidae, Largidae, Pentatomidae, Plataspidae, and Pyrrhocoridae, several repetitions
larger than 100 bp have been found. All of the large repetitions and some large non-repetitions could be folded
into stem-loop structures. However, no CSB has been
found among these control regions. Because the control
regions show extreme variability across the taxa and even
among closely related species, primary sequence of much
of the control region does not appear to be particularly
important for regulatory function [48]. Among these 11
complete heteropteran mt-genomes, the control regions
are not always the most AT-rich regions (Table 1). Thus
the common alternative term for the control region, the
AT-rich region, should probably not be used even though
each control region had one or several more AT-rich subregions. Interestingly, in most cases the large tandemly
repeated sequences are more AT-rich but not always the
most, especially in Plataspidae, where large tandem repetitions consisting of (117 bp)4 are the most AT-rich subregions (calculated from J-strand) (see Additional file 6).

Conclusion
In this study, the data sets of mt-genomes in Heteroptera
were enlarged. These true bugs experienced a high rate of
the genome reorganization; translocations of tRNAs were
found in Aradidae, Pyrrhocoridae, and Largidae, recombination events were observed in Alydidae and Malcidae,
and a tetranucleotide ATCA was inferred to be the initiation codon of ND2 in Cydnidae. So, considering the mtgenomic sequences developed in previous studies, the
hemipteroid insects are extremely complex groups exhibiting great mt-genomic diversity and these insects are well
worth further study.
In infraorder Pentatomomorpha, phylogenetic analyses
based on nucleotide sequences favor the monophyly of
each superfamily (the monophyly of Aradoidea has been
generally accepted though it has not been analyzed in this
study) and raise a robust hypothesis of (Aradoidea + (Pentatomoidea + (Pyrrhocoroidea + (Lygaeoidea + Coreoidea)))). Rearrangement of tRNA-T and tRNA-P also favor
the monophyly of Pyrrhocoroidea. Furthermore, the CSB
in the intergenic spacers between tRNA-H and ND4 favor
the monophyly of Lygaeoidea.
Nucleotide sequence of mt-genome is a powerful molecular tool for resolving insect phylogenetic relationships at
the level of the superfamily and family. However, use of
gene arrangement for phylogenetic analysis in such hierarchies is limited because of its rarity. In future studies,
larger taxa sampling is needed to establish the feasibility
of using gene arrangement for phylogenetic analysis.
Gene rearrangements are not correlated with nucleotide
substitution rates. Different evolutionary patterns among
the genes are derived from the variation of the CG content. CO1 is the slowest evolving protein and ATP8 is the
fastest one. For ND1, in many polar or nonpolar regions,
the specific identify of amino acid residues may be more
important than maintaining the polarity of these regions,
while the opposite is true for ND6. No CSB has been
found among the control regions and many parts of the
control regions do not appear to be particularly important
for regulatory functions. The use of the term "AT-rich
region" to describe the control region should be reconsidered, because this region is not always the most AT-rich
part of the mt-genome.

Mitochondrial DNA preparation, amplification and
sequencing
Total genomic DNA was extracted from thorax muscle tissue using a CTAB-based method [66]. The mt-genomes
were amplified with two to four overlapped fragments.
The primers of co1F, cytbF, and cytbR were modified from
Simon et al. (1994) [67]. The other primers were then
designed from the sequenced fragments of the CO1 and
the Cytb amplified with co1F & co1R and cytbF & cytbR or
from the comparison results of the CO1, the CO2, and the
Cytb of other insects. Each pair of primers special to each
species to amplify two long fragments were named with
the first three letters of the family name (see Additional
file 7). PCR reactions were performed with a TaKaRa LA
PCR Kit Ver.2.1 according to the manufacturer's recommendations. PCR thermal cycling included 1 minute initial denaturation at 94Â°C, 32 cycles of 20 seconds at
94Â°C, 1 minute at 50Â°C~60Â°C, and 1~10 minutes at
68Â°C, and a final elongation for 15 minutes at 72Â°C. The
PCR products were electrophoresed in 0.7% agarose gel
and purified, then sequenced on both strands with the
primer walking method by Beijing Sunbiotech Co. Ltd.
Sequence assembly and analysis

chondrial sequences with CLUSTAL X. Transfer RNA analysis was conducted using tRNAscan-SE version 1.21 [70]
with the invertebrate mitochondrial codon predictors,
and the tRNAs not detected by tRNAscan-SE were identified by BLAST search and comparison with the other
determined heteropterans in this study. Analyses of
sequences were performed with Phyltest [71], MEGA version 4.0 [72], DnaSP version 4.10.9 [73] and DAMBE version 4.2.13 [74,75].
Phylogenetic analysis
Complete sequences of each gene were used in the phylogenetic analyses except the stop codons of the protein coding genes. All PCGs were aligned based on amino acid
sequences aligned with MEGA, rRNAs and tRNAs were
aligned with CLUSTAL X under the default settings. The
ambiguously aligned regions of PCGs and rRNA genes
were carefully adjusted "by eye". The alignments of tRNA
genes were corrected according to the secondary structures, especially the stem regions. Then the aligned
sequences were concatenated to be the N123RT data set
including 2 rRNAs, 22 tRNAs and 13 PCGs. This data set
was used to reconstruct the phylogenetic trees by ML and
Bayesian analyses respectively. In both of the algorithms,
the general reversible model (GTR + I + G) and the parameters optimized by Modeltest version 3.7 [76] were used.
ML analyses were conducted with PAUP* version 4.0b10
[77]. Bayesian analyses were conducted with MrBayes version 3.1.1 [78], with two simultaneous runs for 1,000,000
generations with the first 25% discarded as burn-in.
Another data set including only the 1st and 2nd codon
positions of PCGs (the N12 data set) was also used to
reconstruct the phylogeny by the same methods.
