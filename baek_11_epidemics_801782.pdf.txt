Abstract
Previously, we explored the epidemic pattern and molecular characterization of enteroviruses isolated in
Chungnam, Korea from 2005 to 2006. The present study extended these observations to 2008 and 2009. In this
study, enteroviruses showed similar seasonal prevalent pattern from summer to fall and age distribution to
previous investigation. The most prevalent month was July: 42.9% in 2008 and 31.9% in 2009. The highest rate of
enterovirus-positive samples occurred in children < 1-year-old-age. Enterovirus-positive samples were subjected to
sequence determination of the VP1 region, which resolved the isolated enteroviruses into 10 types in 2008
(coxsackievirus A4, A16, B1, B3, echovirus 6, 7, 9, 11, 16, and 30) and 8 types in 2009 (coxsackievirus A2, A4, A5, A16,
B1, B5, echovirus 11, and enterovirus 71). The most prevalent enterovirus serotype in 2008 and 2009 was echovirus
30 and coxsackievirus B1, respectively, whereas echovirus 18 and echovirus 5 were the most prevalent types in
2005 and 2006, respectively. Comparison of coxsackievirus B1 and B5 of prevalent enterovirus type in Korea in 2009
with reference strains of each same serotype were conducted to genetic analysis by a phylogenetic tree. The
sequences of coxsackievirus B1 strains segregated into four distinct clusters (A, B, C, and D) with some temporal
and regional sub-clustering. Most of Korean coxsackievirus B1 strains in 2008 and 2009 were in cluster D, while
only “Kor08-CVB1-001CN” was cluster C. The coxsackievirus B5 strains segregated in five distinct genetic groups
(clusters A-E) were supported by high bootstrap values. The Korean strains isolated in 2001 belonged to cluster D,
whereas Korean strains isolated in 2005 and 2009 belonged to cluster E. Comparison of the VP1 amino acid
sequences of the Korean coxsackievirus B5 isolates with reference strains revealed amino acid sequence
substitutions at nine amino acid sequences (532, 562, 570, 571, 576-578, 582, 583, and 585).
Introduction
Human enteroviruses (HEV) are RNA viruses from the
picornaviridae family. Clinical consequences of HEV
infections include the common cold, hand-foot-mouth
disease, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, myocarditis,
encephalitis, poliomyelitis, and aseptic meningitis. The
latter, which mainly affects young children, is the most
commonly encountered illness associated with enteroviral infections, often appearing in the form of outbreaks
[1-3]. More than 80 immunologically distinct serotypes
cause infections in humans; they are grouped into polioviruses, echoviruses (ECV), coxsackievirus A (CVA),

coxsackievirus (CVB), and enterovirus (EV) types 68-71.
These viruses are also divided into several subgroups:
polioviruses and HEV-A, HEV-B, HEV-C, and HEV-D
[4-7].
Outbreaks of enteroviruses typically peak during the
summer and early fall, and various serotypes are often
associated with a single outbreak. The predominant
enterovirus types vary from year-to-year, with ECV 9,
13, 18, and 30 and CVB 5 being the most frequently isolated in Europe and the United States over the past few
years [8-10]. Since 1993, when nationwide surveillance
began in Korea, there had been reports of summer outbreaks of enteroviruses, involving ECV 5, 6, 7, 9, 13, 18,
and 30, CVA 24, CVB 3 and 5, and EV 71 [11,12].
The enterovirus genome contains a 7,500 nucleotidelong single-stranded RNA molecule with polarity. The 5’
and 3’ non-coding regions (NCRs) are generally highly
conserved in general. The most variable regions of the

genome are within the genes encoding the capsid proteins, VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4, which are partially
exposed on the virus surface [13-15]. Laboratory diagnosis of enterovirus infections is based on amplification of
highly conserved regions within the enteroviral RNA
genome, The 5’NCR seems to be the most conserved
region among enteroviruses and is therefore targeted
widely in diagnostic procedures [16,17]. In addition to
traditional virological methods used to identify the
enterovirus serotype, reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods based on amplification of VP1 region have been recently developed
[18-20]. Since the VP1 region is one of the main
exposed regions of the viral capsid and has been suggested to include a serotype specific antigenic neutralization site, the BC loop in the VP1 region is, in
particular, one of the regions associated with viral antigenicity, and substitutions resulting in conformational
changes in this region are believed to play a role in host
adaptation for enteroviruses [21-23]. Appropriately, the
partial VP1 sequences were compared with a database
of complete enterovirus VP1 sequences of all serotypes
to determine whether the isolates were related genetically to any known enterovirus serotype [19]. In addition, phylogenetic analysis from sequence data of the
VP1 region is considered to be a standard method of
molecular analysis for epidemiological purposes and the
clustering or genotyping in combination with phylogenetic analysis is able to discriminate between lineages
within a serotype and to identify emerging new variants
or serotypes [24].
An epidemic due to enterovirus occurred in Chungnam, Korea in 2008 and 2009. Presently, to determine
the enterovirus serotypes of the epidemic, viral cultures
were carried out by inoculating samples to susceptible
cell lines and examining the cytopathic effects. Also,
molecular detection was performed using 5’ NCR RTPCR and sequencing of the VP1 region of enteroviruses.
The aim was to determine the epidemiology of the
enterovirus infection and molecular characteristics of
the Korean CVB 1 and CVB 5 isolates.

Materials and methods
Virus isolation

Using susceptible cell lines such as rhabdomyosarcoma
(Rd), Vero, and buffalo green monkey (BGM) cells,
enteroviruses were isolated from 1,214 clinical stool or
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from hospitalized
patients whose symptoms were consistent with enterovirus infections in Chungnam, Korea in 2008 and 2009.
RT-PCR

The testing algorithm for detection and molecular typing of enterovirus was previously described [11]. Cells

exhibiting 70% cytopathic effects were frozen and
thawed three times and viral RNA was extracted from
the supernatant of the infected cells using Magneticbeads (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The extracted RNA was
dissolved in 50 μL of nuclease-free water and stored at
-70°C until used for RT-PCR. For cDNA synthesis, a 20
μL reaction mixture containing 5 μL of each viral RNA,
0.2 μL primer (AN32, AN33, AN34, and AN35) (Table
1), 4 μL of 5X reverse transcriptase buffer, 2 μL of 0.1
M dithiothreitol (DTT), 4 μL of 10 mM M-MLV reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used. The
mixture was reacted at 20°C for 10 min, 37°C for 120
min, 95°C for 5 min, and then chilled on ice. PCR was
performed using a primer set specific for the 5’ NCR of
the enterovirus as described previously [25]. Briefly, a 50
μL reaction mix containing 0.2 μM of primers ENT-F
and ENT-R (Table 1), 2U of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), 100 μM concentrations of mixture
of dNTPs, and 2 μM MgCl2 was amplified by 35 cycles
of 94°C for 1 min, 52°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min.
The final extension step was extended to 72°C for 7
min. Semi-nested PCR amplifying the VP1 coding region
was carried out as described previously [18]. In the
initial PCR, a 50 μL reaction mix containing 0.2 μM of
primers 224 and 222 (Table 1), 2 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega), 100 μM concentrations of mixture of
dNTPs, a 2 μM MgCl2 was amplified by 40 cycles of 95°
C for 30 sec, 42°C for 30 sec, and 60°C for 45 sec. One
microliter of the first PCR product was added to a second PCR for semi-nested amplification. Fifty microliters
of a reaction mix containing 0.2 μM of primers AN89
and AN88 (Table 1), 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase
(Promega), 100 μM concentrations of a mixture of
dNTPs, and 2 μM MgCl2 was incubated at 95°C for 6
min prior to 40 amplification cycles of 95°C for 30 sec,
60°C for 20 sec, and 72°C for 15 sec.
Nucleotide sequencing and molecular typing

PCR products were purified using the QIA quick PCR
purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Purified DNA
was added in a reaction mixture containing 2 μL of Big
Dye terminator reaction mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA) and 2 pmoles of AN88 and AN89 primers
(Table 1). Sequencing reactions were subjected to initial
denaturation at 96°C for 1 min and 25 cycles consisting
of 96°C for 10 sec, 50°C for 5 sec, and 60°C for 4 min in
a Gene Amp PCR system 2700 (Applied Biosystems).
The products were purified by precipitation with 100%
cold ethanol and 3 M sodium-acetate (pH 5.8), and then
loaded on a model 3100 automated genetic analyzer
(Applied Biosystems). The molecular type of each isolates was determined by the serotype of the highest
scoring strain in Genbank using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST); that is, the sequence of the

reliability of the phylogenetic tree was determined by
bootstrap re-sampling of 1,000 replicates.

Sequence analysis of CVB 1 and CVB 5

Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

Seventeen Korean CVB 1 and eight Korean CVB 5
strains that displayed a more informed profile were
selected for sequence analysis (Table 1). Nucleotide and
deduced amino acid sequences of candidate enterovirus
isolates were compared with the reference strains using
CLUSTAL W (version 1.81) and Megalign (DNASTAR)
[27]. These programs are applied Needleman and
Wunsch algorithm (M-NW similarity test). A similarity
score between each pair of sequences was obtained
manually after sequential pairwise alignment (M-NW
similarity test) was performed. The quality of the alignment could not be measured, and the gap opening penalty (GOP) and the gap extension penalty (GEP) values
were used as default values [28,29]. The phylogenetic
relationships among the VP1 sequences of each virus
isolate were inferred by using MEGA software v. 4.0.
Maximum Composite Likelihood was used as the substitution method, while the neighbor-joining method was
used to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree [30]. The

The enterovirus candidates sequences reported here
were deposited in the Genbank sequence database, with
the accession numbers summarized in Table 1.

Results
Enterovirus detection and molecular typing

In 2008 and 2009, 1214 samples obtained from patients
with aseptic meningitis and enterovirus-related disease
were subjected to a diagnostic RT-PCR with cell culture
that generated 436 bp amplicons, corresponding to a
highly conserved domain in 5’ NCR. Eighty two enteroviruses were isolated from 435 cases (18.9%) in 2008
and 107 enteroviruses were isolated from 779 cases
(13.7%) in 2009. For molecular typing and phylogenetic
analysis, the VP1 amplicons generated in the seminested PCR were sequenced and were determined to
correspond with a 372 bp VP1 region. Gapped BLAST
analyses were carried out and each virus was assigned
the type that gave the highest VP1 identity score. The

not generated from 18 samples by semi-nested PCR.
(Table 2)
Epidemiological features of enterovirus in Chungnam

Temporal distribution of the epidemic enterovirus in
Chungnam was seasonal, with most cases occurring during the summer from June to September. The enterovirus detection rate in these months in 2008 and 2009,
respectively, was 25.0% and 16.7% in June, 42.9% and
31.9% in July, 39.2% and 26.4% in August, and 14.3%
and 17.0% in September (Figure 1).
Seventy four cases (90.2%) of 82 total samples in 2008
and 102 cases (95.3%) of 107 total cases in 2009 involved
individuals < 10-years-of-age. Eight cases (9.8%) in 2008
and five cases (4.7%) in 2009 involved individuals > 10years-of-age. The highest rate of enterovirus-positive
samples were from patients < 1-year-of-age (31.7% in
2008 and 57.0% in 2009) (Figure 2.). Of the total 189 isolates, 121 were from males and 68 were from females,
giving a male-to-female ratio of approximately 1.78:1.
The major clinical symptoms of hospitalized patients
infected by enterovirus are summarized in Table 3.
Aseptic meningitis was the major clinical manifestation
(80.5% in 2008 and 56.1% in 2009). The other clinical
symptoms were respiratory illness (6.1% in 2008 and
15.0% in 2009), acute gastroenteritis (4.9% in 2008 and

13.1% in 2009), herpangina (1.2% in 2008 and 7.5% in
2009), or hand-foot-mouth disease (1.2% in 2008 and
0.9% in 2009).
Sequence analysis of CVB 1 and CVB 5

To analyze the genetic characteristics of CVB 1, the 21
CVB 1 isolates were examined by RT-PCR amplifying
the VP1 region and sequencing. VP1 sequences for the
CVB 1 isolates were compared with 43 foreign strains.
The CVB 1 sequences segregated into four distinct clusters (A, B, C, and D) with some temporal and regional
sub-clustering (Figure 3). Cluster A showed 15.7-29.2%,
19.3-32.1%, and 17.1-34.0% nucleotide divergence from
cluster B, C, and D, respectively. Cluster B displayed
17.7-26.4% and 15.9-24.8% nucleotide divergence from

cluster C and D, respectively. Cluster C shared 71.783.2% nucleotide identity with cluster D. All Korea
strains (except for Kor08-CVB1-001CN) isolated from
2008 and 2009 belonged to cluster D.
The VP1 sequences of 22 CVB 5 Korean isolates
obtained in 2001, 2005, and 2009 were used to construct a
phylogenetic tree with 19 reference strains from the GenBank database with the same serotype. The CVB 5 strains
segregated in five distinct genetic groups supported by
high bootstrap values (Figure 4). Cluster A showed 18.421.9%, 24.9-29.6%, 15.7-21.6%, and 17.5-22.3% nucleotide
divergence from cluster B, C, D, and E, respectively. Cluster B showed 22.7-27.5% 21.1-23.6%, and 15.1-16.8%
nucleotide divergence from cluster C, D, and E, respectively. Cluster C showed 22.1-29.3% and 22.1-27.4%
nucleotide divergence from cluster D and E, respectively.
Cluster D showed 19.4-22.5% nucleotide divergence with
cluster E. The 2001 Korean isolates in belonged to cluster
D, whereas the Korean isolates from 2005 and 2009
belonged to cluster E. Based on the amino acid sequence
comparison of the VP1 region for isolates of the CVB 5
serotype, the 2009 Korean isolates were substituted at the
positions 583 (T583A). AY was substituted for GH at positions 577 and 578 in the BC loop, as shown in Figure 5.

throughout the year in tropical and semitropical regions,
they are prominent in summer and fall, and far less
detected in winter and spring months [31]. We previously reported the epidemic occurrence of enteroviruses isolated in Chungnam, Korea in 2005 and 2006
[11]. The current study extended these findings by
investigating the difference of the epidemic pattern in
2008 and 2009. The data from 2008 and 2009 revealed a
similar seasonal distribution in prevalence as found in
2005 and 2006. In both 2008 and 2009, enterovirus
infections were most prevalent in July 42.9% and 31.9%,

respectively). The highest rate of enterovirus-positive
samples occurred in children < 1-year-old. However, differences with time were evident concerning the most
prevalent enterovirus serotype: ECV 18 in 2005, ECV 5
in 2006, ECV 30 in 2008, and CVB 1 in 2009.
In the latest study, enteroviruses were most often isolated from patients with aseptic meningitis (80.5% in
2008 and 56.1% in 2009). Since the symptoms of

enterovirus infection are quite variable, surveillance for
other symptoms of enterovirus infection including aseptic meningitis could be prudent. The investigative scope
for symptoms was extended in 2009; this may have
reflected the marked 24% decrease in meningitis-positive
samples.
PCR amplification followed by sequencing the VP1

type enteroviruses. Different VP1 sites have been targeted and demonstrated to contain serotype specific
information [21,22]. Phylogenetic analysis revealed Korean ECV 6 and ECV 30 as the prevalent enterovirus
types in 2008 [32,33]. Presently, a similar phylogenetic
analysis revealed CVB 1 and 5 as the prevalent enterovirus types in Korea in 2009. Clustering or genotyping
in combination with phylogenetic analysis is able to discriminate between lineages within a serotype and to
identify emergent new variants or serotypes [24]. The
sequences of the Korean CVB 1 isolates could be
divided into four genetic clusters (A, B, C, and D) with
at least 15% diversity between clusters according to PV
genotypes [34]. Almost all the Korean CVB 1 isolates in
2008 and 2009 were in cluster D, with only one,
“Kor08-CVB1-001CN”, resident elsewhere, in cluster C.
It is conceivable that “Kor08-CVB1-015CN” and
“Kor08-CVB1-060CN” isolates were the origins of the
2009 Korean strains. The oldest CVB 1 isolates grouped
in cluster A were viruses isolated from 1948 to the early

1980s. The viruses in clusters B and C were isolated
from the 1970s to the mid-1980s and from the
mid1990s to the present, respectively. The latest CVB 1
isolates clustered in group D. It seems appropriate to
suggest that the grouping of these CVB 1 viruses may
differ with time.
The VP1 region containing the BC loop is one of the
main exposed regions of the viral capsid and has been
suggested to include a serotype-specific antigenic neutralization [22,23]. We found amino acid sequence substitutions at nine amino acid sequences (532, 562, 570,
571, 576-578, 582, 583, and 585). Especially, the only
The 2009 Korean isolates displayed a T®A replacement
of only amino acid 583.
In the reconstruction of the phylogenetic tree based
on the VP1 nucleotide sequences of Korean isolates and
the reference strains of CVB 5, all Korean isolates recovered in 2001 were segregated from the other lineage
groups. In cluster E, the 2009 Korean isolates were
divided to the 2005 Korean isolates because of amino

acid sequence substitutions at the amino acids 578
(N®H) and 583 (T®A). Consequently, we determined
the epidemiological patterns of patients with enterovirus-related diseases in Korea in 2008 and 2009. Also,
the most prevalent types in 2009 (Korean CVB 1 and
CVB 5) genetically characterized using amino acid
sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis.
