Complementary transcriptomic, lipidomic, and
targeted functional genetic analyses in cultured
Drosophila cells highlight the role of
glycerophospholipid metabolism in Flock House
virus RNA replication

Abstract
Background: Cellular membranes are crucial host components utilized by positive-strand RNA viruses for
replication of their genomes. Published studies have suggested that the synthesis and distribution of membrane
lipids are particularly important for the assembly and function of positive-strand RNA virus replication complexes.
However, the impact of specific lipid metabolism pathways in this process have not been well defined, nor have
potential changes in lipid expression associated with positive-strand RNA virus replication been examined in detail.
Results: In this study we used parallel and complementary global and targeted approaches to examine the impact
of lipid metabolism on the replication of the well-studied model alphanodavirus Flock House virus (FHV). We found
that FHV RNA replication in cultured Drosophila S2 cells stimulated the transcriptional upregulation of several lipid
metabolism genes, and was also associated with increased phosphatidylcholine accumulation with preferential
increases in lipid molecules with longer and unsaturated acyl chains. Furthermore, targeted RNA interferencemediated downregulation of candidate glycerophospholipid metabolism genes revealed a functional role of several
genes in virus replication. In particular, we found that downregulation of Cct1 or Cct2, which encode essential
enzymes for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, suppressed FHV RNA replication.
Conclusion: These results indicate that glycerophospholipid metabolism, and in particular phosphatidylcholine
biosynthesis, plays an important role in FHV RNA replication. Furthermore, they provide a framework in which to
further explore the impact of specific steps in lipid metabolism on FHV replication, and potentially identify novel
cellular targets for the development of drugs to inhibit positive-strand RNA viruses.

Background
The relatively small genome of most positive-strand
RNA viruses compels these pathogens to use cellular
machinery to complete their replication cycles. The
search for these “host factors” utilized by positive-strand
RNA viruses is at the forefront of virology research, due
in part to the possibility that cellular proteins or processes may represent more stable drug targets or provide broader antiviral activity when disrupted [1]. One

diverse host factor that has been identified as crucial for
positive-strand RNA virus replication are intracellular
membranes [2-5]. Although viruses that contain a lipid
envelope as a structural component clearly utilize cellular membranes to form infectious virions, all positivestrand RNA viruses, both enveloped and non-enveloped,
also depend on host intracellular membranes for the
assembly and function of the viral RNA replication complexes essential for genome amplification. The precise
functions of cellular membranes in this process have not
been fully defined, but may include: (i) serving as structural scaffolds for replication complex targeting and
assembly; (ii) protecting viral RNA or replication

intermediates from cellular antiviral defense responses;
or (iii) providing essential protein or lipid cofactors for
optimal viral enzymatic activities. These proposed functions are not mutually exclusive, and it is likely that cellular membranes and their constituent components play
multiple roles in viral RNA replication.
To investigate the role of host factors in viral RNA
replication we use Flock House virus (FHV), a versatile
model virus and natural insect pathogen that assembles
robust functional RNA replication complexes in yeast
[6,7], plant [8], mammalian [9], nematode [10], and
insect cells [11]. This broad array of eukaryotic hosts
that support FHV RNA replication suggests that cellular
factors utilized by this virus are widely conserved. The
FHV genome is bipartite, with two positive-sense RNA
segments copackaged into a non-enveloped virion (Fig.
1A). The larger 3.1-kb genomic segment, RNA1,
encodes protein A, the FHV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is the only viral protein required for
functional RNA replication complex assembly. FHV
assembles its RNA replication complexes on mitochondrial outer membranes [7,11], where they are targeted
and anchored in part via an amino-proximal transmembrane domain present within protein A [12]. During
RNA replication FHV produces a 0.4-kb subgenomic
segment, RNA3, which encodes the RNA interference

(RNAi) suppressor protein B2. This viral counterdefense
protein is required for maximal viral RNA synthesis in
cells with an active RNAi antiviral system [10,13]. Since
subgenomic RNA3, and hence protein B2, are produced
only during active RNA replication, they serve as convenient and quantitative markers for FHV RNA replication
complex activity. The smaller 1.4-kb genomic segment,
RNA2, encodes the structural capsid protein precursor.
The FHV capsid protein is required for infectious virion
production but is dispensable for viral RNA replication,
and therefore engineered self-replicating viral RNAs,
termed replicons, need only contain FHV RNA1
(Figs. 1B and 1C).
Apart from the membrane localization of its viral
RNA replication complexes, additional lines of evidence
point to the importance of membranes, and in particular
lipids, in FHV replication. Protein A is a lipid-binding
protein with particular affinity for specific anionic phospholipids [14], which may mediate in part the protein
A-membrane interactions required for replication complex assembly. FHV RNA replication induces dramatic
mitochondrial membrane rearrangements [7,11,15,16],
reminiscent of structures seen with other positive-strand
RNA viruses [2]. The fatty acid synthetase inhibitor cerulenin disrupts FHV RNA replication [17], consistent
with the activity of this inhibitor on other positive-

strand RNA viruses [18,19]. Finally, FHV RNA replication complex activity in isolated membrane fractions
analyzed in vitro is disrupted by certain detergents [20],
and can be augmented by the addition of exogenous
phospholipids [21]. These results all suggest a central
role of cellular lipid metabolism in FHV RNA replication complex assembly and function. However, none of
them provide direct evidence for a functional impact of
specific lipid metabolism pathways on FHV RNA replication within intact cells.
In this report, we use complementary transcriptomic,
lipidomic, and targeted functional genetic analyses to
specifically examine the role of lipids in FHV RNA replication in cultured Drosophila cells. We demonstrate that
FHV infection or replicon expression upregulates the
transcription of a distinct set of cellular genes, several of
which are involved in lipid metabolism. Furthermore,
FHV RNA replication induces global changes in cellular
phospholipid content, and in particular phosphatidylcholine (PC), and pharmacologic or genetic disruption
of PC synthesis within cells inhibits FHV RNA
replication.

Results
FHV RNA replication induces transcriptional upregulation
of lipid metabolism genes in Drosophila S2 cells

We examined the transcriptional responses of Drosophila S2 cells to FHV RNA replication using genomewide microarray analyses. To focus on cellular responses
related to RNA replication rather than those associated
with other steps in the viral life cycle, such as virion
attachment, entry, uncoating, encapsidation, and virion
release, we conducted parallel analyses of cells either
infected with FHV or transfected with an RNA1 replicon-expression plasmid. The RNA1 segment of the FHV
genome encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Fig. 1A) and is the only genome segment
required for RNA replication (Fig. 1C). Thus, FHV RNA
replication can be initiated in S2 cells by the introduction of a self-replicating RNA1 via the inducible plasmid
pS2F1 (Figs. 1B and 1C) [22]. To maximize the number
of S2 cells expressing the replicon, we first generated
stable cell lines containing pS2F1 or a control plasmid
(pS2F1fs, see Fig. 1B legend) containing a translationdefective RNA1 segment. Although there was a low
level of baseline FHV RNA replication in pS2F1-expressing cells due to leaky metallothionein promoter activity,
induction with copper sulfate resulted in a dramatic
increase in subgenomic RNA3 and protein B2 accumulation, indicative of highly active viral RNA replication
complexes (data not shown).
We analyzed transcript levels from three independent
experiments with either FHV-infected cells or cells
expressing an RNA1 replicon, and identified cellular

genes whose transcription was significantly up- or
downregulated in response to these stimuli. We identified 790 genes that were significantly upregulated and
392 genes that were significantly downregulated in
FHV-infected S2 cells (Additional File 1), and 305 genes
that were significantly upregulated in pS2F1-expressing
cells (Additional File 2). There were no significantly
downregulated genes in pS2F1-expressing cells. Full
details regarding the molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components for these genes are provided in the additional files. We further analyzed these
datasets for transcripts that were upregulated with both
stimuli and identified 73 co-regulated genes, which
encoded proteins involved in numerous aspects of cellular physiology, such as metabolism, defense responses,
and signal transduction (Table 1 and Additional File 3).
Based in part on the well recognized importance of cellular membranes in positive-strand RNA virus replication [3-5], we focused on those genes that encoded
proteins with known or hypothesized roles in lipid
metabolism. We found that infection with FHV upregulated eight lipid metabolism-associated genes, whereas
RNA1 replicon expression upregulated thirteen lipid
metabolism-associated genes (Fig. 2A). Four of these
genes were upregulated in both datasets, including Cct1
and Cct2, which encode CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferases. These enzymes are essential for the salvage
pathway of PC synthesis but have non-overlapping functions in Drosophila cells [23-26]. We validated both
Cct1 and Cct2 mRNA upregulation by RT-PCR after
FHV infection (Fig. 2B) and RNA1 replicon expression
(Fig. 2C). These results demonstrated that FHV RNA
replication in Drosophila S2 cells was associated with
distinct alterations in cellular gene transcription, including the transcription of genes associated with lipid
metabolism.
FHV RNA replication alters phospholipid levels in
Drosophila S2 cells

The conclusion that FHV RNA replication was associated with transcriptional upregulation of lipid metabolism genes predicts that quantifiable changes in lipid
constituents should also be observed, particularly with
respect to PC content. To examine this prediction we
measured total PC levels in S2 cells after infection or
replicon expression using a modified phospholipase Dbased biochemical assay [27] (Fig. 3A). As a control for
these experiments we used cells treated with 1-hexadecylphosphorylcholine (miltefosine), which is a specific
CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase inhibitor [28].
S2 cells infected with FHV had a 35% increase in total
PC levels, whereas treatment with miltefosine reduced
PC levels by 40% (Fig. 3A, left graph). Furthermore,
although baseline PC levels in stably transfected cells

and as Additional Files 1, 2 and 3. Specific upregulated genes

by either their gene symbols or CG designations. (B) Semiquantitative RT-PCR validation of Cct1 and Cct2 mRNA upregulation
in Drosophila S2 cells infected with FHV. Decreasing amounts of
cDNA generated by RT with oligo-dT primers and equivalent
amounts of total RNA from mock (upper gel) or FHV-infected S2
cells (lower gel) were amplified with gene-specific primers for
Drosophila actin (Act5C), Cct1, or Cct2, and PCR products were
examined by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide
staining. The expression level of the Act5C transcript in microarray
experiments was not significantly altered with FHV infection or
replicon expression. Densitometry analysis of PCR products
generated from cDNA dilutions that produced submaximal signals
showed that FHV infection induced 2.0 ± 0.2 and 2.3 ± 0.3 fold
increases in Cct1 and Cct2 mRNA levels, respectively, consistent with
quantitative microarray results (see Additional File 1). (C) Semiquantitative RT-PCR validation of Cct1 and Cct2 mRNA upregulation
in Drosophila S2 cells expressing an FHV replicon. RT-PCR was
performed as described above with total RNA from S2 cells
containing the control plasmid pS2F1fs (upper gel) or FHV repliconencoding plasmid pS2F1 (lower gel). Densitometry analysis of PCR
products as described above showed that FHV replicon expression
induced 1.9 ± 0.2 and 2.8 ± 0.9 fold increases in Cct1 and Cct2
mRNA levels, respectively, consistent with quantitative microarray
results (see Additional File 2).

MS) to quantitate polar phospholipids in extracts from
FHV-infected cells. This analysis allowed the determination of relative individual phospholipid species content
as a molar percentage of total recovered polar phospholipids but also provided details on total acyl chain length
and saturation levels. As controls for these experiments
we used cells treated with miltefosine to decrease PC
levels or cells cultured with 1 mM oleic acid (cis-9-octadecenoic acid), which increases the production of phospholipids with individual C18:1 acyl chains and hence
total sum acyl chain compositions of C36:2. Complete
detailed results from the ESI-MS/MS analyses are provided in Additional File 4. Control membrane extracts
from S2 cells contained predominantly PC and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) as the primary phospholipids,
with the latter representing the majority (~40%) of all
phospholipids (Fig. 3B). Although PC is typically the
most prominent phospholipid in most eukaryotic cell
membranes, Diptera species such as Drosophila contain
relatively high levels of PE [29]. As expected, miltefosine
dramatically reduced PC content with compensatory
increases in the percentages of PE and phosphatidylinositol (PI). In contrast, total cellular membranes from
FHV-infected S2 cells showed a trend towards an
increase in the molar percentage of PC and phosphatidylserine (PS) with an associated decrease in PE content,
but these differences were not statistically significant
(Fig. 3B). However, when we analyzed PC species based
on total acyl chain length or saturation level there were
modest but statistically significant changes in the percentage of PC molecules with total acyl chain lengths of
32 or 34 carbons (Fig. 3C) and 0, 1, or 2 total double
bonds (Fig. 3D), where FHV infection increased the fraction of PC molecules with longer unsaturated acyl
chains. Furthermore, the selective increase in longer
unsaturated acyl chains in FHV-infected cells was seen
specifically with PC and not PE, PI, or PS (Fig. 3E and
data not shown). These quantitative lipid analysis results
suggested that FHV infection induces selective changes
in PC metabolism, and are consistent with the observation that FHV RNA replication complex activity in isolated membrane fractions analyzed in vitro is
preferentially stimulated by phospholipids with increased
acyl chain length and decreased saturation [21].
Manipulation of glycerophospholipid metabolism gene
expression modulates FHV RNA replication in Drosophila
S2 cells

We next examined the potential functional significance
of lipid metabolism gene upregulation on FHV RNA
replication in S2 cells using a targeted genetic approach
that employed RNAi-mediated knockdown [17]. We
identified thirty-one cDNAs within the O’Farrell RNAi
collection [30] that were targeted toward genes involved

in glycerophospholipid metabolism in Drosophila cells,
generated 300-600 bp dsRNAs, and performed RNAi
knockdown experiments with infected S2 cells using
dsRNA targeted against FHV RNA1 and miltefosine as
positive controls (Fig. 4A). To quantitate FHV RNA
replication, we used an optimized capture enzymelinked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) that detected protein B2, which is a viral protein only produced during
active RNA replication (see Fig. 1C). Although protein
B2 is an RNAi suppressor, it functions during the
assembly of RNAi-induced silencing complexes [31],
and therefore would have less impact on the activity of
functional silencing complexes formed during the 48 h
dsRNA incubation period prior to FHV infection. We
found that dsRNAs directed against five cellular genes,

Ace, Cct1, Cct2, fu12, and san, all significantly suppressed FHV RNA replication in infected S2 cells (Fig.
4A). Although the level of suppression was 20-40% with
individual knockdown of these five genes, the positive
control FHV dsRNA only reduced protein B2 levels by
~45%, suggesting that this medium throughput assay
provided a conservative estimate of the functional
impact of cellular glycerophospholipid metabolism gene
knockdown. The functions of Cct1 and Cct2 have been
described above. Ace encodes acetylcholine esterase [32],
fu12 encodes an enzyme with 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity [33], and san also encodes
an enzyme with acyltransferase activity [34]. The
enzymes encoded by Cct1, Cct2, Ace, fu12, and san are
all involved in PC synthesis, either directly or indirectly

Figure 4 RNAi-mediated knockdown of Drosophila genes involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism modulate FHV replication in S2
cells. (A) Medium throughput RNAi-based functional screen of select glycerophospholipid metabolism genes. Drosophila S2 cells were cultured
in 96-well plates, incubated with dsRNA targeting specific glycerophospholipid metabolism-related genes, positive control FHV RNA1, or negative
control LacZ for 48 h, infected with FHV, and harvested 18 h after infection. As an additional separate control, selected wells were treated with
50 μM miltefosine at the time of infection. FHV replication was assayed by protein B2 (PtnB2)-specific capture ELISA. Parallel MTT viability assays
demonstrated > 90% viability for all dsRNA- or miltefosine-treated samples compared to LacZ dsRNA-treated control (data not shown). Results
are expressed as the percentage of PtnB2 accumulation relative to LacZ dsRNA-treated control (hatched line). P-value < 0.05* or 0.005**. (B)
Schematic of eukaryotic glycerophospholipid synthesis pathways. The simplified biosynthetic pathways shown were adapted from the detailed

(Fig. 4B). The main glycerophospholipids in the cell, PC
and PE, are synthesized through two metabolic pathways, the de novo synthesis pathway that uses PS as a
precursor for both, and the salvage or CDP pathway,
also referred to as the Kennedy pathway, which recycles
choline and ethanolamine to produce PC and PE,
respectively [35]. In higher eukaryotes the salvage or
CDP pathway of PC synthesis normally predominates,
where the conversion of phosphocholine to CDP-choline, which is catalyzed by CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferases such as those encoded by Cct1 and Cct2,
is the rate limiting step [35]. Thus, we chose to focus

To verify the functional impact of Cct1 and Cct2

(lane 4) for 72 h, and gene-specific mRNA expression was examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR as described in Fig. 2, except that only results
from cDNA dilutions that produced submaximal signals are shown. (B) Total PC content in cells treated with the dsRNAs described above. PC
levels were determined as in Fig. 3. (C) Viability of cells treated with dsRNAs described above determined by MTT assay. (D) FHV RNA

FHV and viral-specific RNAs or protein were analyzed by northern blotting or immunoblotting 12 h after infection, respectively. For viral RNA
analysis, blots for positive-sense (+) and negative-sense (-) genomic RNA1 and subgenomic (+)RNA3 are shown. The decrease in (+)RNA1
accumulation in Cct1 knockdown cells (lane 4) was not consistently seen in all experiments. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) bands detected by ethidium

in total PC levels with individual knockdown of either
Cct1 or Cct2 mRNA, and a ~60% reduction with knockdown of both genes (Fig. 5B). The incomplete knockdown of Cct1 and Cct2 mRNA, the presence of a Cctindependent de novo PC synthesis pathway (see Fig.
4B), and the essential role that PC plays in cellular
structure and metabolism all likely contributed to the
lack of synergistic suppression of total PC levels with an
RNAi-based approach that targeted one step in the biosynthetic pathway. We also examined cell viability by
MTT assay, as disruption of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase expression or function in mammalian
cells results in enhanced susceptibility to apoptosis
[36-38]. Individual knockdown of either Cct1 or Cct2
mRNA had no significant impact on cell viability,
whereas co-knockdown of both genes resulted in a
small but reproducible 15% reduction in cell viability as
measured by MTT assay (Fig. 5C). We infected S2 cells
with FHV after RNAi-mediated suppression of Cct1,
Cct2, or both genes, and measured viral RNA and protein accumulation at 12 h after infection. Downregulation of either Cct1 or Cct2 individually suppressed FHV
subgenomic (+)RNA3 accumulation by ~30%, but did
not significantly reduce the accumulation of genomic

However, downregulation of both Cct1 and Cct2
resulted in a 40-65% reduction in the accumulation of
all viral products examined, similar to the levels of suppression seen with the positive controls miltefosine and
dsRNA directly targeting FHV RNA1. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the small reduction in
cell viability with co-knockdown of both Cct1 and Cct2
(Fig. 5C) adversely affected viral RNA or protein accumulation, potentially via apoptosis-mediated reduction
in synthesis or stability, published studies have demonstrated that FHV replication is not sensitive to the antiviral effects of apoptosis induction in Drosophila cells
[39]. These results indicated that genetic or pharmacologic disruption of PC synthesis inhibited FHV RNA replication in infected S2 cells.
To further examine the functional impact of Cct1 and
Cct2 on FHV RNA replication in the absence of infectious virus, we repeated experiments using RNAimediated downregulation of these genes in S2 cells
expressing an RNA1 replicon (Fig. 6). We could not use
stably transfected cells for genetic knockdown experiments, as the low level of FHV RNA replication in these
cells in the absence of copper sulfate induction resulted

in protein B2 production that inhibited RNAi-mediated
downregulation of cellular genes (data not shown).
Therefore, we used a transient transfection approach.
We treated S2 cells with dsRNAs for 48 h, transfected
cells with pS2F1 (see Fig. 1B) and control plasmid
pS2LacZ, and measured FHV RNA replication by northern blotting and b-galactosidase activity by enzymatic
assay 18 h after induction. We used pS2LacZ as a transfection control, as modulation of PC levels may influence transfection efficiency. Knockdown of either Cct1
or Cct2 suppressed FHV (+)RNA3 accumulation by 2040% in pS2F1-transfected cells, whereas knockdown of
both genes increased suppression to 65%, similar to
levels seen with control dsRNA targeted against FHV
RNA1 (Figs. 6A and 6B). We did not quantitate genomic (+)RNA1 or protein A accumulation levels in transfected cells, as these viral products accumulated to low
and almost undetectable levels in pS2F1-transfected
cells (Fig. 6A and data not shown), such that attempts
at quantitation would have been unreliable. Nevertheless, these results supported the conclusion that disruption of PC synthesis by genetic modulation of Cct1 or
Cct2 inhibited FHV RNA replication.
Finally, we examined whether disruption of Cct1 or
Cct2 expression directly suppressed FHV protein A
accumulation or membrane association (Fig. 7), as we
have previously demonstrated that cellular factors can
impact viral RNA polymerase production [17,22] and
hence facilitate an early step in RNA replication complex assembly (see Fig. 1C). Although protein A levels
were decreased in FHV-infected cells with RNAimediated downregulation of both genes (Figs. 5D and
5E), protein A accumulation in the setting of infectious
virus or an FHV replicon is directly linked to RNA
replication (see Fig. 1C). Thus, we used a protein A
expression vector, called pS2FA-HA (Fig. 7A), which is
designed to optimize translation and prevent RNA
replication via modification of 5’ and 3’ untranslated
sequences that contain essential cis elements [17,22].
In contrast to the effects of Cct1- or Cct2-specific
dsRNAs on FHV RNA replication (Figs. 5 and 6),
knockdown of either gene had no effect on RNA polymerase accumulation in cells transfected with pS2FAHA (Fig. 7B), whereas dsRNAs against Hsp83 suppressed polymerase accumulation by 60%, consistent
with published studies demonstrating the important
role of hsp90 chaperones in FHV protein A synthesis
[17,22]. Furthermore, knockdown of Cct1, Cct2, or
both genes did not alter the ability of protein A to
associate with intracellular membranes, as determined
by differential centrifugation (Fig. 7C). These results
indicated that PC synthesis was important for FHV
RNA replication but not viral polymerase production
or membrane association.

Discussion
Global approaches such as transcriptomic, proteomic,
and functional genomic analyses have provided important clues to critical host-pathogen interactions that
influence virus replication and pathogenesis [40-47].
However, these approaches when used in isolation often
provide an overwhelming amount of information that
requires careful selection and validation. We have used
an alternative approach that incorporates more targeted
analyses including lipidomics to specifically examine the
role of glycerophospholipid metabolism in FHV RNA
replication. The results presented in this report further
support the well described crucial role that intracellular
membranes play in positive-strand RNA virus replication [3-5], but emphasize that cellular lipids are key
membrane constituents for this particular host-pathogen
interaction. Furthermore, this report provides new
details on the impact of specific lipid metabolism pathways on viral RNA replication, and in particular PC biosynthesis. The identification of specific lipid metabolism
pathways is an essential first step in the rationale design
of antiviral strategies that target cellular rather than
viral components. Indeed, the recognition that cholesterol metabolism is important for hepatitis C virus replication in cultured cells [48,49] has led to direct clinical
trials using cholesterol synthesis inhibitors [50].
The observation that PC is important for FHV RNA
replication in cells is consistent with results published
almost twenty years ago, which demonstrated that phospholipids enhance FHV RNA replication complex activity in isolated membrane fractions analyzed in vitro [21].
It also supports the hypothesis that one potential role
cellular membranes play in viral RNA replication is to
provide functional co-factors such as phospholipids for
optimal RNA polymerase activity, and is consistent with
published observations on the functional impact that
phospholipids have on Semliki Forest virus nsP1 methyltransferase activity [51]. The precise mechanism(s)
whereby phospholipids enhance FHV RNA replication
complex activity is unknown, and there are multiple
steps during process of viral RNA replication that could
be influenced by these cellular components (see Fig.
1C). Interestingly, the observation that individual knockdown of Cct1 or Cct2 expression had an apparent preferential effect on subgenomic RNA3 production (Fig. 5)
suggests that this particular step may be especially sensitive to cellular phospholipids. In addition to their potential roles as functional cofactors, membrane-resident
lipids may also play other roles during RNA replication,
such as providing a scaffold for replication complex targeting and assembly. Indeed, we recently demonstrated
that FHV protein A is a lipid-binding protein with particular affinity for anionic phospholipids, including the

Page 11 of 16

mitochondrial-specific phospholipid cardiolipin [14].
Interestingly, we could not detect a significant physical
interaction between FHV protein A and PC using in
vitro assays [14], suggesting that PC may influence protein A activity indirectly or interact via some as yet unidentified intermediate protein or lipid.
Transcriptional array results suggested that FHV RNA
replication stimulated PC synthesis in part via Cct1 or
Cct2 upregulation, but the molecular mechanisms
whereby FHV modulates lipid biosynthesis are
unknown. One hypothesis is that FHV simply takes
advantage of the cellular stress response to virus infection that may induce changes in phospholipid metabolism. However, published microarray results with
cultured S2 cells infected with various pathogens,
including viruses, bacteria, parasites, or fungi do not
demonstrate a consistent upregulation of glycerophospholipid metabolism-related genes [44,47,52]. An alternative hypothesis is that FHV directly and specifically
modulates glycerophospholipid metabolism. Interestingly, the enzyme encoded by Drosophila Cct1 is activated by cellular lipids, and in particular cardiolipin
[24], suggesting a potential link with the observed protein A-cardiolipin interaction [14]. Phosphatidic acid,
which represents the essential precursor in the synthesis
of all glycerophospholipids [35] (see also Fig. 4B), also
physically interacts with FHV protein A [14] and could
serve as a potential conduit for regulation. Although
these hypotheses are speculative and cannot directly
explain transcriptional upregulation, they are readily testable with FHV using established in vitro and in vivo
systems.
We focused on PC for this report, but our results do
not exclude the potential important role of other cellular phospholipids in FHV RNA replication. Indeed, both
transcriptomic (Fig. 2A) and functional genetic (Fig. 4A)
analyses identified numerous additional candidate lipid
metabolism-associated genes linked to FHV RNA replication. Furthermore, the lipidomics analysis examined
total cellular membrane lipid content, whereas FHV
RNA replication complexes localize to outer mitochondrial membranes and induce dramatic morphological
and structural changes [11,15]. Although most glycerophospholipids, and in particular the highly abundant PC
and PE, are widely distributed in membranes throughout
the cell [29,53], detailed analyses of mitochondrial outer
membrane lipids may reveal interesting and potentially
more dramatic changes than we observed with the total
cellular lipid analyses. Experiments are currently in progress to isolate and examine mitochondrial and submitochondrial fractions from cells with active FHV RNA
replication complexes using well established techniques
[54]. In addition, the observation that specific acyl chain

Castorena et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:183
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/183

modifications that result in longer unsaturated PC species were seen in FHV-infected cells suggests that particular lipid changes apart from the phospholipid head
group also may play important roles in viral RNA replication. This is consistent with the demonstration that
brome mosaic virus RNA replication is suppressed in
yeast with a deletion of the enzyme Δ9 fatty acid desaturase [55]. FHV replicates robustly in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae [12,56,57], and preliminary results suggest that
FHV RNA replication in yeast is also influenced by
alterations in PC metabolism (K. Stapleford and D.
Miller, unpublished results). Phospholipid metabolism
pathways and their regulation have been well studied in
yeast [58], and therefore this genetically tractable host
provides an excellent companion for parallel studies
with Drosophila cells to further examine the impact of
lipid metabolism on FHV RNA replication.

Conclusions
In this study we demonstrate through a combination of
complementary targeted and global analyses that glycerophospholipids, and in particular PC, play an important
role in FHV RNA replication. These results enhance our
understanding of the essential function that cellular
membranes have in facilitating positive-strand RNA
virus replication, and suggest that modulating cellular
phospholipid synthesis may represent a novel approach
for targeted antiviral development.
Methods
Cells and virus

Drosophila S2 cells were cultured in Schneider’s Drosophila media (SDM) and transfected with inducible
expression plasmids as previously described [17].
Sucrose gradient-purified FHV [11] was used for all
infection experiments.
Plasmids, antibodies, and chemicals

Standard molecular biology procedures were used for all
cloning steps. The FHV RNA1 replicon expression plasmid pS2F1 (Fig. 1B), the protein A expression plasmid
pS2FA-HA, and the control plasmid pS2LacZ have been
previously described [17]. The control plasmid pS2F1fs,
which contains an early frameshifting mutation in the
protein A coding region (Fig. 1B) and hence will not
produce a functional cis replicon transcript [6,12], was
generated by cloning the ScaI/BsrGI fragment from
pF1fs [6] into the MscI/Acc65I sites of pMT-V5/HisA
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies
against FHV protein A have been previously described
[11], and antibodies against FHV protein B2 were generously provided by Paul Ahlquist (University of Wisconsin-Madison). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the
hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag or the voltage-

Page 12 of 16

dependent anion channel porin were purchased from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) or Affinity
Bioreagents (Golden, CO), respectively, while monoclonal antibodies against tubulin were purchased from the
Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of
Iowa, Iowa City, IA). All secondary reagents for ELISA
and immunoblot analyses were purchased from Jackson
Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). The CTP:phosphocholine cytidyltransferase inhibitor miltefosine (1-hexadecylphosphorylcholine) was purchased from
Calbiochem (San Diego, CA) and stored as a 100 mM
stock solution in dimethylsulfoxide at -20°C. Oleic acid
(cis-9-octadecenoic acid) was purchased from Sigma (St.
Louis, MO) and stored as an undiluted stock solution at
-20°C.
FHV infection, replicon induction, and total RNA isolation

Cells were either infected with FHV at a multiplicity of
infection of 10 as previously described [11] and harvested at 12 to 24 h after infection, or transiently transfected with pS2F1 and pS2LacZ as previously described
[17] and harvested at 18 h after induction with 0.5 mM
copper sulfate. For microarray and phospholipid analyses, S2 cells stably transfected with pS2F1 or pS2F1fs
were induced with 1 mM copper sulfate and harvested
at 18 h after induction. Total RNA was isolated using
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer’s
instruction. For microarray and RT-PCR analyses, RNA
was further processed by digestion with RQ1 DNAse
and subsequent purification with RNAsy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Total RNA purity, integrity, and
concentration were checked by spectrophotometry and
agarose gel electrophoresis, and samples were stored at
-80°C until analysis.
Affymetrix microarray data acquisition and analysis

Affymetrix Drosophila Genome 1.0 or 2.0 microarrays
were used for FHV infection or replicon experiments,
respectively, and biotinylated amplified cRNAs were
produced using Affymetrix GeneChip target labelling
kits per the manufacturer’s instructions. Microarrays
were scanned with an Affymetrix Scanner 3000, and
complete original data files for all microarray experiments have been deposited in the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
geo/ under the accession number GSE15469.
Genomatix ChipInspector software package was used
for primary microarray data analyses. This program
uses a single probe method with an enhanced statistics
package based on a SAM algorithm [59] that incorporates a t-test with a permuted artificial background to
reduce false-positives. The following parameters were
chosen to identify sets of up- or downregulated transcripts: (i) false-discovery rate of 1%; (ii) three probe

Castorena et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:183
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/183

minimum coverage; and (iii) 1.5-fold change from control. Similar results were obtained when microarray data
were analyzed with the Affymetrix package of Bioconductor [60]. The FlyBase database (FB2008_09; http://
flybase.org/) was used to identify Gene Ontology (GO)
terms, genetic interaction partners, and yeast-human
orthologs for Drosophila genes identified in the microarray analyses.
Semiquantitative RT-PCR validation

First-strand cDNA synthesis was completed with equal
amount of total RNA using oligo-dT primers and the
Superscript II First Strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) per
the manufacturer’s instructions. Ten-fold dilutions of
cDNA were used for PCR reactions with gene-specific
primer sets (Table 2) under the following conditions:
200 nM primers, 58°C annealing temperature, and 30
cycles. RT-PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel
electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining.
Phospholipid analysis

Total PC content was determined using a modified
phospholipase D-based enzymatic method initially developed for measurement of plasma PC levels [27]. Briefly,
S2 cells were pelleted at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C,
washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (100 mM

concentrations were calculated using a standard curve
generated with purified PC. Parallel total protein concentrations were determined with cell lysates prepared
using TBS and 1% n-octyl-b-D-glucopuranoside and
BioRad total protein reagent with bovine serum albumin
as the standard. For analysis of individual cellular phospholipids, S2 cells were pelleted, washed twice with
TBS, and lipids were extracted with chloroform:methanol using the method of Bligh and Dyer [61]. Final
extract samples were dried under vacuum and analyzed
for polar lipid content by ESI-MS/MS at the Kansas
Lipidomics Research Center http://www.k-state.edu/
lipid/lipidomics/index.htm.
dsRNA production and RNAi induction

The O’Farrell RNAi library was purchased from the
Drosophila Genome Research Center (DGRC). This collection contains 300-600 bp double-stranded cDNAs
corresponding to greater than 7,000 individual phylogenetically conserved Drosophila genes [30], which can
all be amplified by PCR using a common oligonucleotide primer (S2-RNAi-T7) that contains a GC-rich linker
and T7 RNA polymerase promoter (Table 2). PCR products were generated using Eppendorf Mastermix with
200 nM primers, annealing temperature of 62°C, and 40
cycles. If no product was obtained after the first amplification, a second PCR was done using an aliquot of the
first reaction as a template. PCR products were analyzed
by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining and purified using a PCR cleanup kit
(Promega) per the manufacturer’s instruction. To generate the cDNA templates for Cct1 and Cct2 validation
studies, candidate RNAi targets that differed from the
O’Farrell library constructs were identified using the ERNAi program [62]. To generate control FHV RNA1specific dsRNA we targeted nucleotides 40-735, which
include the initiator AUG codon. RT-PCR with genespecific primer sets that incorporated a T7 RNA polymerase promoter (Table 2) were used to generate PCR
templates for dsRNA generation. Control LacZ and
Hsp83 cDNAs were produced as previously described
[17].
RNAs were generated using a T7 Megascript kit
(Ambion) per the manufacturer’s instruction, purified
by phenol-chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation, and resuspended in RNAse-free water.
dsRNAs were generated by heating samples to 65°C for
30 min and cooling slowly to room temperature. Samples were analyzed by non-denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining to ensure
the formation of properly sized dsRNA products, quantitated by spectrophotometry, and stored at -20°C until
used for RNAi studies. RNAi was induced in cultured
S2 cells as previously described [17]. Briefly, 10 μg

dsRNA was added to 10 6 cells in 0.5 ml serum-free
SDM, incubated at 25°C for 1 h, 0.5 ml SDM with 20%
fetal bovine serum was added and cells were incubated
for an additional 48-72 h prior to FHV infection or
replicon transfection.
FHV RNA replication analyses

To facilitate the analysis of FHV RNA replication in a
medium throughput format, an FHV protein B2 capture ELISA was developed. FHV protein B2-specific
polyclonal antibodies for detection were purified from
rabbit antisera by Staphylococcus aureus protein A affinity chromatography and biotinylated with 6-(biotinamidocaproylamido)caproic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide
ester (Sigma) per the manufacturer’s instructions. For
capture antibodies, total immunoglobulins from FHV
protein B2 antisera were isolated by saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation. Flexible microassay plates
were coated with 5 μg/ml capture antibody in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (100 mM sodium chloride,
50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) overnight at 4°C,
blocked with 1% non-fat milk, and S2 cell lysates in
PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100 were incubated in duplicate wells for 2 h at room temperature. Plates were
washed extensively with TBS and 0.1% Tween 20,
incubated with 1.25 μg/ml biotinylated detection antibody followed by streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase.
Plates were developed with 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl
phosphate in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH
10.0) with 1 mM magnesium chloride and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured with the microplate
reader described above. Initial optimization experiments demonstrated a high sensitivity for this assay,
where lysates from less than ten S2 cells expressing a
pS2F1-based replicon produced a positive signal (data
not shown). Northern blot analyses for FHV-specific
RNAs, immunoblot analyses for protein A accumulation, saponin-mediated permeabilization and differential centrifugation, and b-galactosidase assays were
done as previously described [17,22].
Viability assays

Viability assays were performed using 3- [4,5dimethylthizol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) as previously described [63].
Statistical analyses

Microarray statistical analyses are described above. For
additional statistical analyses a two-tailed t test assuming
equal variances was used and a p value of < 0.05 was
considered significant. All results are representative or a
composite of at least three independent experiments,
where quantitative data represent the mean ± standard
errors of the mean.
