Abstract
Background: Large amino acid transporter gene families were identified from the genome
sequences of three parasitic protists, Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania major.
These genes encode molecular sensors of the external host environment for trypanosomatid cells
and are crucial to modulation of gene expression as the parasite passes through different life stages.
This study provides a comprehensive phylogenetic account of the origins of these genes, redefining
each locus according to a positional criterion, through the integration of phyletic identity with
comparative gene order information.
Results: Each locus was individually specified by its surrounding gene order and associated with
homologs showing the same position ('homoeologs') in other species, where available. Bayesian and
maximum likelihood phylogenies were in general agreement on systematic relationships and
confirmed several 'orthology sets' of genes retained since divergence from the common ancestor.
Reconciliation analysis quantified the scale of duplication and gene loss, as well as identifying further
apparent orthology sets, which lacked conservation of genomic position. These instances suggested
substantial genomic restructuring or transposition. Other analyses identified clear instances of
evolutionary rate changes post-duplication, the effects of concerted evolution within tandem gene
arrays and gene conversion events between syntenic loci.
Conclusion: Despite their importance to cell function and parasite development, the repertoires
of AAT loci in trypanosomatid parasites are relatively fluid in both complement and gene dosage.
Some loci are ubiquitous and, after an ancient origin through transposition, originated through
descent from the ancestral trypanosomatid. However, reconciliation analysis demonstrated that
unilateral expansions of gene number through tandem gene duplication, transposition of gene
duplicates to otherwise well conserved genomic positions, and differential patterns of gene loss
have produced largely customised and idiosyncratic AAT repertoires in all three species. Not least
in T. brucei, which seems to have retained fewer ancestral loci and has acquired novel loci through
a complex mix of tandem and transpositive duplication.

Background
Amino acid transporter (AAT) proteins are crucial to the
metabolism and physiology of trypanosomatid parasites
[1]. Among these unicellular eukaryotes are Trypanosoma

brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania major, which are
causes of substantial human morbidity worldwide. These
organisms have a digenetic life cycle, being transmitted
into a vertebrate host from a haematophagous insect vecPage 1 of 17

tor. The medical importance of these parasites prompted
the recent completion of their genome sequences [2-4],
which have provided an improved understanding of their
genetic repertoire. Furthermore, greater appreciation of
surface-expressed proteins regulating membrane transport may lead to new therapeutic targets or improved
means of drug-delivery [5,6]. This study addressed the
repertoire of AAT genes through the integration of
phyletic and positional information, to identify the mechanisms by which new loci originated during the history of
the Trypanosomatidae. Hence, the specification of loci
across the family was explicitly phylogenetic, reflecting
the histories of AAT genes, and spatial, using comparative
gene order information to establish homoeology (i.e.,
orthologous genes found in conserved genomic positions).
The importance of AAT proteins to trypanosomatids as
cell surface regulators of amino acid transport is manifold.
Amino acids are used as primary energy sources during the
insect stages, due to the relative oligotrophy of the vector
midgut environment and the relative abundance of proline [7,8,1]. Arginine is also utilised as an energy reservoir
when it is converted into phosphoarginine by arginine
kinase in Trypanosoma spp. [9,10]. These substrates are so
important that they are necessary for the culture of vector
stages in T. cruzi and can ensure survival during starvation
conditions [11,12]. Besides this, an intracellular pool of
amino acids is permanently maintained by trypanosomatids for osmoregulation [13-15]. The various host environments of any trypanosomatid life cycle vary greatly in
the osmotic stress they place on the parasite. Successful
transition between host environments requires modulation of the intracellular osmolytes, which mostly comprise alanine, glycine, glutamate and ornithine [13]. For
both energetic and osmotic reasons, the demands on AAT
proteins vary as the parasite progresses through its life
cycle; evidence suggests that ambient amino acid concentrations operate as cues for developmental differentiation
and therefore, that AAT proteins act as physiological indicators during life stage transition [16-18]. Hence, efficient
regulation of amino acid transport is not only vital for survival in particular life stages, it is also imperative for successful transition between stages.
Trypanosomatid genomes contain large numbers of AAT
genes, often arranged in tandem gene arrays [2-4]. Transporters of specific amino acids and generic substrates are
known [19,20], and expression of these genes can be
linked to particular life stages. Distinct low- and highaffinity arginine transporters are expressed in both T. cruzi
[21,22] and L. donovani [23]. In T. cruzi at least, expression
is known to be stage-specific, with activity ceasing in
bloodstream-form, non-replicating trypomastigotes [17].
Similarly, multiple proline transporters are known in T.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/26

cruzi [24] and L. donovani [25]. A proline-specific protein
is active in the L. donovani promastigote (vector form), but
silenced in the amastigote (vertebrate) form when proline
ceases to be the primary energy source [25]. Hence, the
diverse AAT repertoires of trypanosomatids appear to
entail specialisation of individual loci to regulation of particular amino acids, and enable modulation of intracellular amino acid concentrations in response to changes in
host environment. Most of these transporters have been
biochemically characterised but not related to a specific
locus in the genome sequence. While the capacity for differential expression of proteins with alternative substrate
affinities is well established, corresponding sequence has
only been obtained for a high-affinity arginine transporter
in L. donovani [23], an amastigote-specific transporter in L.
amazonensis [26] and a polyamine permease in L. major
[27]. Other studies have detailed the sequence variation
among AAT genes in L. major promastigotes [28] and T.
cruzi [29], without individually characterising their products. From these it is clear that gene repertoire far exceeds
what has been biochemically characterised, but these lists
may not be complete and their specific classifications
have not been harmonised.
This study applied a comparative approach to gene family
evolution of AAT genes in trypanosomatids, with the principal objective of determining the origins of individual
AAT loci and the mechanisms responsible for differences
in repertoire between species. The three genome
sequences were compared to identify all AAT loci and
define each component as shared or distinct. Defined by
their genomic position, one expects loci to be represented
in multiple species, with all genes at that position being
termed homoeologs. Exceptions to the pattern, for
instance, failure to find orthologous sequences in the
same location, or discovery of an unrelated sequence in a
homoeologous position, are powerful indicators of evolutionary mechanisms. Hence, homoeology was inferred to
classify all loci with unique identities, regardless of species.
This protocol was compared with classifications already
available for each individual species. Phylogenetic
hypotheses of the entire gene family were estimated and
patterns of duplication and loss were inferred through reconciliation analysis. Analysis of gene diversity was complemented with assessments of evolutionary rate changes
in response to duplication and of the roles of concerted
evolution and gene conversion in regulating sequence
evolution.

Results
The genome sequences of T. brucei, T. cruzi and L. major
include 36 unique AAT loci, as specified by their genomic
positions. These positions were inspected in each species
to determine gene complement. Phylogenetic reconstruction of all AAT gene sequences using both Maximum Like-

lihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI) methods was the
basis for subsequent analyses of evolutionary rate changes
and reconciliation analyses of gene duplication and loss.
Finally, the effects of concerted evolution and gene conversion on AAT gene sequences, both within and between
loci, were examined for their potential to introduce artefact into phylogenetic reconstruction and to regulate
sequence diversity.
AAT gene complement
The three trypanosomatid genomes display a generally
conserved gene order, despite substantial karyotypic differences [3], allowing orthologous sequences to be connected by their genomic positions, specified by
surrounding gene order. Even when the AAT gene was
absent, the genomic position by which the locus was specified was typically conserved. The 36 AAT loci are listed in
Table 1 and are hereafter referred to by their locus number
and the initials of their host species; many of the loci comprised tandem-duplicated genes, producing a total
number of 94 distinct gene sequences. The classification
in Table 1 has been reconciled with previous classifications for each individual trypanosomatid species, for T.
brucei [30], T. cruzi [29] and L. donovani [28]. Immediately, it is clear that these studies, which recorded distinct
AAT sequences from tissue preparations or preliminary
read libraries, found only a fraction of the total AAT gene
diversity. However, TzPAT types 1 and 6 from T. cruzi
found no direct match in the current T. cruzi genome
sequence; these two sequences were previously identified
from preliminary read data and confirmed using RT-PCR
[29], and their absence from the completed genome
sequence probably suggests sequence gaps, where there
were insufficient reads to assemble a finish contig.

Comparison of AAT gene complements showed that 6 loci
are present in all species (AAT1, 11, 13–16), although
their copy number varied, for example, AAT1 included 4
copies in L. major but was single-copy in Trypanosoma spp.
Other loci were shared by two of three species and indicated gene losses. For instance, 3 loci were shared by L.
major and T. cruzi, but not T. brucei (AAT 21, 26, 27). Similarly, AAT8 was not found in T. cruzi. A further 3 loci were
found in Trypanosoma spp. but not L. major (AAT5, 12,
17), suggesting either loss or an origin after the separation
of genera. All loci are shown in Figures 1 and 2 with the
conserved positions of absent AAT genes (shaded grey).
For both T. brucei and L. major, the number of vacant positions (and, conversely, of species-specific loci) in these figures indicates that each species has a largely customised
AAT gene repertoire, with 7/17 T. brucei loci, 9/19 L. major
loci and 7/19 T. cruzi loci being species-specific respectively.

AAT gene family phylogeny
Figure 3 shows a ML phylogenetic tree estimated for 93
AAT gene sequences, with substitution rates specified by a
GTR+I+Γ model. As shown by the high Bayesian posterior
probabilities and bootstrap values at most basal and apical nodes, ML and BI methods produced mutually consistent estimates. Both the basal nodes (between AAT14 and
AAT15) and crown clades in the tree were robust. Many of
these clades corresponded to 'orthology sets' of gene
sequences from two or all three species; for example,
homoeologs for AAT11, 13, 15 and 16, which were
present in all species, clustered robustly. Hence, with a few
exceptions (see below), these clades coincided with a
shared genomic position. Several nodes at the base of
larger clades lacked robustness and are shown without
support measures, or with posterior probabilities only.
These nodes occur between AAT16 and AAT17 and correspond to the relationships between the major crown
clades. In the Bayesian tree (not shown) these nodes were
collapsed, and were the only difference between the BI
and ML phylograms. Application of a covarion model to
Bayesian inference made no difference to the tree topology.

Most genes defined as homoeologs based on genomic
position fulfilled expectation by clustering together in the
phylogeny. However, tandem gene duplicates routinely
clustered together, suggesting that the arrays were speciesspecific and recently evolved. Furthermore, these arrays
often did not have homoeologs in other species. For
example, AAT2, 4, 7 and 10 in T. brucei contained many
tandem duplicates; this substantial expansion that was
most closely related to AAT8Lm and AAT17. The genomic
locations of these loci, on chromosomes 4 and 8 in T. brucei, were without clear correspondence in the L. major or
T. cruzi genome sequences, as shown in Figures 1 and 2,
indicating that these loci were novel, or at least rearranged. In L. major, AAT1, 8 and 20 included tandem
duplicates and these clustered together, despite the existence of homoeologs in the first two cases.
The clustering of homoeologs was expected, given that the
affinity between related gene sequences should reflect the
common identity imparted by shared genomic position.
However, Figure 3 shows several close and robust relationships between L. major and T. cruzi loci, where the
genomic position in T. cruzi was conserved in L. major
without any trace of an AAT gene (Figure 2). They include
AAT19lm/AAT30Tc, AAT20Lm/AAT32Tc, AAT22Lm/
AAT35Tc and AAT24Lm/AAT33Tc. In these examples,
sequence identity suggests an affinity, but positional identity does not. In other situations, genes sharing positional
identity are unrelated in gene sequence. AAT23Lm is a
tandem pair; however, the two copies are not closest relatives and display a more complex relationship with AAT1.

AAT25Lm is also a tandem pair but its two copies are
unrelated, and rather than clustering with homoeologs in
L. major, AAT8Tb is almost identical to AAT3Tb.
Reconciliation analysis of duplication and loss
Incongruence between the gene and species trees was reconciled to produce an exhaustive list of duplications and
losses; these are mapped on to the gene tree in Figure 3.
Duplications were classified as either 'transpositive' or
'tandem', depending on whether the duplicate moved to a

new location or not. Basal nodes reflect ancient, transpositive duplications, although these also occurred within
crown clades. For example, the close relationships
between AAT32Tc andAAT36Tc, as well as AAT3Tb and
AAT8Tb, were interpreted as transposed duplications. The
substantial expansions of certain clades in T. brucei and L.
major were interpreted as tandem duplications, with occasional transposition. AAT1Lm expanded to 4 copies
through tandem duplication; the first copy was retained in
all three species. Transposition of the first and second cop-

ies was required to account for AAT23Lm, which is a tandem pair that clustered within the AAT1 clade (as
described above). Likewise, the AAT2/4/7/10 clade originated through tandem duplication with periodic transposition, creating several loci with multiple gene copies (see
Figure 5 below).
Since all species should have orthologs for a given lineage
if it was present in their common ancestor, losses were
invoked where orthologs were not evident. Where
orthologs were present, even if non-homoeologous, neither duplication nor loss was required; such loci originate
through descent from the ancestor. The presence of
homoeologs in two species was explained by loss in the
third species; AAT5Lm, AAT12Lm, AAT17Lm, AAT21Tb,
AAT26Tb and AAT27Tb were all deleted (or transposed)
after separation of the three species. Losses were also
invoked for those clades where sequence affinity suggested orthology, but positional identities were distinct,
for instance AAT22Lm/AAT35Tc and AAT19Lm/AAT30Tc.
As stated previously, these mostly concerned closely
related sequences from L. major and T. cruzi, and so the
would-be ortholog in T. brucei was lost.
The overall picture derived from reconciliation analysis is
summarised by the total numbers of duplications and
losses experienced by each species. T. cruzi and L. major
experienced few transpositive (1 and 3 respectively) and
tandem (0 and 7 respectively) duplications, while T. brucei
experienced many more (5 and 26 respectively). However,
these figures depend on the precise assembly of repetitive
genome sequences, and are probably not accurate (see
discussion). The number of loss events however, is determined by presumed orthologs that are absent, and hence,
directly reflects the relative AAT complement in each species. T. brucei had the more losses (13) than either T. cruzi
(9) or L. major (6). Considering both the obvious orthology sets and those inferred through reconciliation analysis, T. brucei lacks representatives in these clades more
often that the other two species. This suggests that T. brucei
has experienced greater losses of its inherited AAT complement.
Evolutionary rate changes
Relative rates tests were applied to every terminal branch
in the gene tree, after separating the tree into 26 different
subclades. Additional file 1 (and also Figure 3) describes
those tests that recorded a significant difference in evolutionary change between two lineages. Several lineages
showing significantly greater evolutionary change than
their sister lineages or clades derived from duplication
events. The clade comprising AAT2Tb and AAT10.1Tb had
an accelerated substitution rate relative to AAT10.2Tb
(transpositive duplication). The transpositive duplications affecting AAT32/AAT36 and AAT16/AAT18 both

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/26

coincide with significant substitution rate accelerations by
AAT36Tc and AAT18Lm respectively. The clade including
AAT4.2 and two other copies from that array shows a
highly significant elevation in evolutionary rate, relative
to the sequences of AAT7Tb and AAT10.2Tb. Finally,
AAT17.1Tb showed a greater amount of evolutionary
change than its tandem duplicate AAT17.2Tb. Other cases
involve genes originating through descent, rather than
duplication. Among AAT14 orthologs, the T. brucei copy
has experienced a significantly higher substitution rate
than the T. cruzi gene. While among AAT15 orthologs, the
T. brucei gene shows an excess of substitutions relative to
the L. major gene, but not to the T. cruzi copy. Similarly,
AAT19Lm has changed significantly more than its putative ortholog AAT30Tc, and AAT33Tc showed an accelerated substitutional rate relative to its putative ortholog
AAT24Lm.
Effect of concerted evolution
Concerted evolution was detected using a cladistic criterion whereby duplicate sequences were combined in a
phylogenetic tree with homoeologous sequences from
closely related species; concerted evolution was inferred
where conspecific sequences clustered together to the
exclusion of orthologs elsewhere, measured using SH
tests. Of those loci with >2 gene duplicates, AAT4Tb,
AAT9Tb and AAT8Lm could not be tested because no
homoeologous loci existed in the appropriate species. As
Table 2 shows, AAT2Tb and AAT5Tb gave unambiguous
evidence for concert evolution of gene duplicates; where
homoeologs from the various species were constrained to
show orthologous relationships, this topology was significantly less likely than the optimal tree topology, unlike
the topology constrained to show sequences clustering by
species. In the cases of AAT7Tb and AAT1Lm, there were
significant differences between optimal tree topologies
and both hypotheses, suggesting that neither pure orthologous nor pure concerted evolution scenarios were sufficient explanations of sequence relationships. Figure 4
shows the optimal ML tree topology for AAT7Tb and
explains why a tree topology purely reflecting concerted
evolution was inadequate. In fact, AAT7Tb comprises two
lineages: AAT7.9Tb and AAT7.11Tb comprised one lineage and have remained distinct from the remaining 7
duplicates in the array. Duplicates within each of these
'sub-arrays' evolved in concert, since T. brucei/T. b. gambiense copies clustered apart from T. congolense sequences.
But the presence of the two sub-arrays ensured that any
tree constrained to make all sequences monophyletic was
sub-optimal.
Effect of gene conversion
The GENECONV and SISCAN programs were used to
detect unexpected sequence similarities within multiple
alignments of gene duplicates, which were checked by eye

arrays in T. brucei. No further putative events were confirmed in other tandem arrays, or between unlinked AAT
loci. AAT4Tb is a tandem gene array of six copies, which
comprise two distinct sequence types that alternate along
the array. For a 25 bp window, AAT4.2Tb was identical to

the other sequence type (i.e., AAT4.1, 4.3 or 4.5), while
almost identical to AAT4.4 and 4.6 for the remainder of its
length. It was therefore obvious that AAT4.2Tb had been
partially converted by a copy of the second sequence type.
Both GENECONV and SISCAN confirmed that this was a
significant anomaly and indicative of gene conversion.
Similarly, AAT9Tb is a tandem gene array of 5 copies,

Figure 5 for the origin of AAT loci on chromosomes 4 and 8 in T. brucei
Hypothesis
Hypothesis for the origin of AAT loci on chromosomes 4 and 8 in T. brucei. a. Three gene lineages were present on the ancestral chromosome; these were ancestral to the AAT3/AAT8 loci, the AAT4/AAT7 loci and the AAT1 locus respectively. b. Tandem duplication created a dimorphic locus, ancestral to the contemporary AAT4 and AAT7 loci. c. A transpositive duplication
of one sequence type from AAT4/7 produced the monomorphic AAT2/10 locus on the same chromosome. d. A block duplication of the chromosome (denoted by dashed line) resulted in two paralogons (now attached to chromosome 4 and 8). This
duplicated the ancestral gene lineages, creating the contemporary loci. Among AAT4 and AAT7 other events affected gene
number and sequence: CE – concerted evolution, GC – gene conversion, RC – evolutionary rate change. AAT1 has no paralog
on chromosome 8, and so must have been lost. e. AAT9 must have been transposed later since it has no paralog on chromosome 4, and is unrelated to the other loci.

where the first and third duplicates clustered together,
apart from the remaining genes. However, for a 151bp
window towards the C-terminus AAT9.5Tb was identical
to the third duplicate, causing a significant phylogenetic
inconsistency that was interpreted as partial gene conversion of the 3' end of AAT9.5Tb by AAT9.3Tb. Finally, there
were several phylogenetic anomalies observed among the
11 gene duplicates of AAT7Tb; frequent exchange of
sequence motifs was consistent with the high genetic variability among these genes (see Table 2).

Discussion
The AAT loci in T. brucei, L. major and T. cruzi were defined
by their phylogenetic relationships and shared genomic
positions. Previous classifications of AAT loci from individual species were harmonised and it was shown that
none entirely encompassed the diversity evident from
genome sequences. Reconciliation analysis of the gene
family phylogeny identified numerous gene losses and
various transpositive and tandem duplications. Some
among these duplications were associated with significant

changes in evolutionary rate, while others were affected by
concerted evolution and gene conversion. These various
observations accounted for the quite distinct AAT complements in each organism, with only 6 out of 36 loci being
present in all three species. Accordingly, while descent
from a common ancestor was the most parsimonious origin for these and some other loci, most other loci originated through lineage-specific evolutionary innovations.
Origin by descent
Certain AAT loci in each species were inherited from the
common ancestor of all three. These genes formed orthologous clusters in the gene tree and displayed conserved
genomic positions in all three species, or sometimes just
in two. Many of these loci, such as AAT11, 12, 15 and 21,
are found in basal positions and could be viewed as essential genes, loss of which results in negative selection. Their
position reflects a recognised difference in protein family;
they belong to the amino acid polyamine-choline superfamily, while the majority of loci in Figure 3 belong to the
amino acid transporters-1 superfamily. Hence, the functional differences between amino acid transporters and
permeases, (i.e., the transport of molecules with single
and multiple amino groups respectively), may account for
the observed distinction in evolutionary dynamics.
Amino acid permeases have been both lost and duplicated
less often. Among other more 'stable' loci, AAT13, 16 and

17 are amino acid transporters that have originated
through descent, without frequent loss or duplication.
There may be other cases of origin by descent inferred by
reconciliation analysis. For clades such as AAT19lm/
AAT30Tc, AAT20Lm/AAT32Tc, AAT22Lm/AAT35Tc and
AAT24Lm/AAT33Tc the high sequence identity between
loci at different genomic positions indicated orthology,
but apparently no homoeology. They may have originated
through transpositive duplication in one or both species,
coupled with deletion of the original locus, or through a
radical rearrangement of surrounding genes, such that
conserved synteny was lost. Notably, each of these cases
involved L. major and T. cruzi and consequently, the
number of inferred losses in T. brucei was increased commensurately.
Other cases of origin by descent also involved duplication
events, such as AAT1 where an orthologous set is sister
clade to a number of gene duplicates in L. major, and
AAT5, where the locus is arrayed in T. brucei, but a singleton in T. cruzi. However, in the context of employing
amino acid transporter proteins as a means for importing
trypanocidal drugs into the parasites, these loci that show
less flexibility through time, less propensity for duplication, functional differentiation or loss, could be superior
targets since they are less likely to show functional redun-

dancy or sequence variation in the form of tandem duplicates. Their long-standing orthology also suggests that
they have also proven less tolerant of disruption in the
past.
Origin by transpositive duplication
Reconciliation of gene and species trees explained the disparity between gene and species numbers through duplication events. The oldest nodes of the gene tree are
depicted as a series of transposition events, which one can
interpret as occurring between genomic locations, giving
rise to the contemporary crown clades. However, these
events are placed at the time of an ancestor of all trypanosomatids, and the chromosomes in each extant species
probably did not exist in this ancestor. Expansion of the
gene family coincided with the evolution of contemporary trypanosomatid genome structures. One can but
speculate on these evolutionary changes, but they must
have involved chromosomal duplications and fusions,
changes in ploidy and gene capture (xenology). T. brucei
has certainly experienced substantial karyotypic evolution
through chromosomal fusion [31] and this will have
affected its AAT repertoire. Yet the basal nodes in Figure 3
remain in the very distant past, and it is here that implicit
assumptions of this study, that phylogeny is dichotomous
and genomic position is conserved, will be most precarious.

Transpositive duplication is also inferred in the crown
clades, where nearest relatives are found in dissimilar
genomic positions. AAT32Tc/AAT36Tc are almost identical, yet AAT32Lm and AAT20Lm appear to be orthologs,
while AAT36Lm is found in a subtelomeric region
amongst arrays of other high copy gene families.
AAT23Lm is a tandem pair that resulted from the transposition of the first two AAT1 gene copies to a new location;
it is likely that only two AAT1 gene copies existed at that
time, tandem duplication has caused subsequent expansion. In some cases, transpositive duplication coincided
with acceleration of evolutionary rate (or deceleration in
the sibling lineage), which is indicative of functional differentiation [32], for example, AAT36Tc (transposed to a
subtelomeric region) has an accelerated substitution rate
relative to AAT32Tc; AAT2Tb (originated as part of a block
duplication) also has an accelerated evolutionary rate relative to other loci on chromosomes 4 and 8. The combination of transpositive and tandem duplication is
demonstrated well by the loci on chromosomes 4 and 8 in
T. brucei, described in Figure 5. This considerable expansion spans four locations and originated through an initial tandem duplication to create a dimorphic array
(which is now either AAT4Tb or AAT7Tb). Subsequently,
a transposition event from one copy within the dimorphic
array established the AAT10/AAT2 clade. The current situation, with AAT2 and AAT4 on chromosome 4, AAT7 and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/26

AAT10 on chromosome 8, and AAT4/7 and AAT2/10
being paralogous pairs, is best explained through a block
duplication event creating two duplicons, after the initial
tandem and transpositive duplications. This being so, the
phylogenetic position of AAT3Tb and AAT8Tb, which
should also be a paralogous pair affected by the block
duplication (on the basis of genomic position), is puzzling (see below). Finally, the origin of AAT9Tb, found on
chromosome 8 but unrelated to any of the afore-mentioned paralogous pairs, must also be transpositive; these
genes are also only found on one of the putative duplicons (i.e., chromosome 8).
Origin by tandem duplication
Tandem gene arrays are among the most challenging to
resolve correctly using current genome sequencing technology, since repetitive sequence reads tend to collapse
into a single contig when no variation exists to distinguish
them. Hence, it is difficult to determine the presence and
length of tandem arrays; so where variation exists it is
likely that complete genome sequences will contain all
distinctive gene duplicates, but not the correct number. In
general, the patterns of tandem duplication are idiosyncratic. Some comparisons are reliable, for example,
AAT1Lm shows tandem duplication, while AAT1Tb does
not. However, the apparent abundance in T. brucei may
say more about the ability to detect tandem duplicates in
L. major and (especially) T. cruzi, than a real dynamic difference. Confirmation of tandem gene arrays is possible
because most tandem duplicates contain sequence variation, often arranged as distinct sequence types. Indeed,
distinct sequence types characterised by previous studies
can now be seen to originate from a single array; AATP3,
7–10 [30] all derive from AAT4Tb. Similarly, AAP8LD and
AAP11LD are distinct genes in L. donovani [28], and these
correspond to the tandem pair in L. major at AAT27.

Clearly, it is possible for duplicates to become distinct and
maintain their integrity within the array, for instance, the
scenario described in Figure 5 suggests that the two distinct sequence types seen within both AAT4Tb and
AAT7Tb are long-standing. Such discontinuous variation
indicates that tandem duplication may be followed by
adaptive divergence, in the manner of a duplication-divergence-complementation model [32-34], to facilitate the
expression of AATs in specific life stages, or for particular
functions. It is notable that this is achieved within tandem
gene arrays since their particular structural features indicate that variation would ordinarily be removed by concerted evolution (see below). However, functional
differentiation may be promoted by the rapid changes in
evolutionary rate that occasionally coincided with tandem duplication; for instance, AAT17.1Tb had an accelerated substitution rate relative to AAT17.2Tb, while
AAT1.4Lm compared similarly to other gene copies

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:26

within AAT1Lm. In contrast to such diversifying processes, the phylogenetic relationships of tandem duplicates
from closely related Trypanosoma spp., and conflicting
phylogenetic signals from alignments of tandem duplicates, indicated that both concerted evolution and gene
conversion affect tandem duplicates in T. brucei. Partial
allelic gene conversion between tandem duplicates was
observed within three different arrays (see Table 3),
although ectopic gene conversion between loci was never
observed. This is consistent with gene conversion occurring proportionally according to physical proximity and
sequence identity [35-38]. In the short term such small
exchanges would work to diversify sequences, and may
contribute to the generally high level of variation. However, a high rate of genetic exchange would eventually
homogenise, and may then contribute to concerted evolution of gene duplicates.
For its part, concerted evolution was inferred for AAT2Tb,
AAT5Tb and, to some extent, AAT7Tb, after significant
clustering of T. brucei tandem duplicates, relative to
homoeologs in T. congolense, was observed. The alternative explanation is that the heterospecific arrays are convergent, but the presence of a tandem array at these
locations in the ancestor of the African trypanosomes is
more parsimonious. AAT7Tb is an interesting case, since it
suggests how tandem gene duplicates can both evolve in
concert within a species, although still contain variation
(as shown in Table 2). Concerted evolution will homogenise tandem gene duplicates through unequal crossingover between sister chromatids or chromosomes, or
through allelic gene conversion. Both mechanisms rely on
mis-alignment of repetitive structures [39]. AAT7Tb contains two distinct sequence types that, as Figure 5 suggests,
have retained their distinct identities despite proximity
and identity with each other. The two forms are dissimilar
enough to preclude misalignment with each other, but
duplicates of each are not variable enough to prevent concerted evolution among each form. Hence, copies of each
evolve in concert, but these collectively retain orthology
with homoeologs in T. congolense (and therefore, failing
both 'concerted evolution' and 'orthology' SH tests in
Table 2).
Parasite evolution and AAT repertoire
A combination of gene loss, transposition and tandem
duplication has generated quite distinct AAT repertoires in
trypanosomatids; also, gene sequences have often been
affected in a species-specific manner by conservative and
diversifying evolutionary pressures. Hence, the AAT repertoire is relatively labile, raising the question of how origination of novel loci and loss of established genes are
regulated. At a proximate level, processes causing duplicated genes to be maintained at a new location or within
an array have already been discussed: neo-functionalisa-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/26

tion through accelerated divergence from the ancestral
gene will ensure that subsequent loss is deleterious, while
divergence, perhaps associated with gene conversion, will
reduce the chances of deletion through unequal crossingover within a tandem array. Those AAT loci characterised
thus far suggest that the ultimate causation for changing
AAT repertoires will derive from the specific needs of life
stages and the particular properties of substrates. For
example, AAT25Lm is a tandem pair, showing 84% identity. The two genes are not represented in Trypanosoma
spp., although the surrounding gene order is very well
conserved. The first of these genes was previously characterised in L. donovani (AAP2LD, [28]), and expressed in
promastigote-stage cells (i.e., the vertebrate-infective
stage). Conversely, the second gene was characterised in L.
amazonensis, and shown to be expressed in the amastigote
(i.e., the vertebrate, intracellular stage) [26]. Hence, in this
instance, the duplication event may have been maintained due to sub-functionalisation of the tandem duplicates, resulting in their stage-specificity. Although these
genes show a relatively high identity, they are not placed
together in Figure 3, and this suggests that they are not
tandem duplicates, but have come together at AAT25Lm
through transposition or ectopic gene conversion. However, neither gene at AAT25Lm was placed robustly in the
phylogeny.
Trypanosomatids have different amino acid requirements
at each point in the life cycle. This occurs for both energetic and osmotic functions and relates to the very different chemical environments of the vector and vertebrate
hosts. In a more general sense a suite of transporters are
required for different substrates; AAT11 (corresponding to
AAP10LD, [28]) and AAT21 (corresponding to TzPAT12,
[29]) are positioned basally in Figure 3 and have been previously characterised as transporters of polyamines, rather
than amino acids. These loci, and other probable
polyamine transporters positioned basally such as AAT15
and AAT31, can be aligned with other amino acid transporters. They provide an obvious demonstration of how
the gene family has diversified to transport distinct substrates. At a subtler level, proliferation of amino acid
transporters may have facilitated specialisation to certain
amino acids, according to need [24,17]. High affinity
transporters of proline and arginine have been characterised and may have evolved since these particular substrates are of energetic importance [23,25]. AAT13
corresponds to a known high-affinity arginine transporter
[23]. Low affinity transporters also regulate proline and
arginine [25,22] but are able to transport many other
amino acids, such as methionine [19] and glutamate [20];
AAT17 may correspond to a proline transporter [29]. To
summarise, experimental evidence suggests that the precise functions of AAT loci relate to both substrate and to
life stage. A combination of transposition and tandem

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:26

duplication have provided the raw material for expansion
of the gene family, which ultimately allows the parasite to
manage its total amino acid content, and specific amino
acid concentrations where these perform additional functions, as in the cases of proline and arginine.

Conclusion
The origins of amino acid transporter loci in trypanosomatid parasites are complex, with evidence for both
changes to gene complement and to gene sequences.
Given that AAT loci have identities that transcend and predate the histories of specific genomes, definition of AAT
loci according to their genomic positions and phylogenetic relationships, (i.e, by homoeology), was a successful
strategy. Reconciliation of the gene tree with the species
relationships indicated that gene complement has
evolved through both transposition and tandem duplication. Often these duplicative origins were accompanied by
conversion or rapid divergence of gene sequences, and
experimental evidence elsewhere suggested that the novelty created by duplication is maintained to satisfy the
requirements of particular life stages or for precise regulation of specific amino acids. While the repertoire of
polyamine transporters was largely conserved in all three
species (though not entirely without gene losses), the
amino acid transporter complement showed substantial
interspecific variation. This was exemplified in T. brucei
where deletions of ancestral loci, combined with the derivation of many new genes through a chromosomal, block
duplication, has generated a different AAT repertoire to
either L. major or T. cruzi. Therefore, despite their importance to cell development and function, or perhaps
because of this, and despite the general conservation of
gene order among these three trypanosomatids, AAT loci
have proven evolutionarily labile and prone to repeated
innovation.

Methods
Sequence retrieval and locus specification
AAT gene sequences were obtained from GeneDB [40].
The genome sequences for T. brucei, T. cruzi and L. major
were searched for annotated amino acid transporters. To
check for unannotated sequences that could be aligned,
AAT genes were BLASTed against all coding sequences for
each species. Gene loci were then specified by genomic
position. Starting with T. brucei, each AAT locus was
defined by the surrounding gene order. Where multiple
genes were arrayed, the whole array was considered a single locus. This resulted in 17 unique loci in T. brucei
(labelled AAT1-17). The L. major genome sequence was
then inspected; where a gene displayed conserved synteny
with a T. brucei locus, it was assigned the same identity,
and the corresponding genes were considered homoeologous. This resulted in 19 loci, 7 of which were present with
conserved synteny in T. brucei, and a further 12 loci with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/26

unique identities (AAT18-29). Finally, AAT loci in T. cruzi
were identified; the presence of AAT1-29 was checked by
using the surrounding gene order in T. brucei and/or L.
major to search the T. cruzi genome sequence. Where an
AAT gene was found in a corresponding position, the
locus was again given the same specification. This resulted
in 12 homoeologous AAT loci. After discounting these
from all available AAT genes in the T. cruzi genome
sequence, this left an additional 7 genes in genomic positions that were not represented in either T. brucei or L.
major (AAT30-36). For two of these genes (AAT34 and
36), their position on small contigs suggested that they
were distinct within T. cruzi, but meant that there was
insufficient positional information to assess homoeology.
Hence, a total of 36 loci showing unique positional identities were specified across three species.
Sequence alignment
All gene sequences, including gene duplicates within tandem gene arrays, were aligned using ClustalX [41].
Sequences were labelled by their locus and species, for
example, AAT5Tc describes AAT5 in T. cruzi. Tandemlyarrayed genes were given sequential labels, for example, in
T. brucei where AAT5 is present with four arrayed copies,
these are labelled AAT5.1Tb to AAT5.4Tb. Sequences were
aligned after translation to maximise the observed conservation and then end-trimmed to remove the amino- and
carboxy-termini that could not generally be aligned. The
remaining conserved domains comprised 2199 bp, with
considerable gaps inserted due to the difference in length
between AAT14Lm (2349 bp) and most other loci (~1400
bp). All subsequent analyses were carried out on the backtranslated alignment of nucleotide sequences.
Phylogenetic estimation
The gene tree was reconstructed using two methods, maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI). The
ML phylogeny was estimated using PHYML v2.4.4
[42,43]; a general-time reversible model [44] was applied,
with multiple substitution rates (six rate categories) and
empirical base frequencies. The proportion of invariant
sites and the gamma distribution parameters (α) were
both optimised. An input tree was defined by neighbourjoining and robustness was assessed through 500 nonparametric bootstrap replicates [45]. AAT31Tc was
assigned as the outgroup, based on its distance from other
taxa in a neighbour-joining tree. AAT34Tc could not be
satisfactorily aligned and so was not included in the analysis; this left a total taxon set of 93 individual sequences
(derived from 35 loci).

The BI phylogeny was estimated using MrBayes v3.1.2
[46,47]. The substitution model was defined by the
default settings with two exceptions: in the first analysis
substitution rates were set to 'invgamma', and in a second

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:26

analysis, a covarion model [48,49] was applied to assess
the effect of coevolving sites on the estimation process.
The optimal topology was determined using a MonteCarlo Markov Chain (MCMC) process to search treespace. 4 parallel MCMC chains were run for 1,000,000
generations, with a sample frequency of 100 generations
and a burn-in of 5,000 generations. The output was
checked for stationarity using Tracer v1.2.1 [50]; the burnin was found to be sufficient to achieve stationary model
parameters. AAT31Tc was again assigned as the outgroup
and AAT34 TC was omitted.
Reconciliation analysis
The phylogeny of a gene family transcends the history of
an individual species, and genes can evolve independently
of species phylogeny. Therefore, gene trees reflect, but are
not identical to, species trees. By reconciling the differences between gene and species trees, it is possible to infer
gene duplications that have occurred, as well as losses
where genes were absent from genomic positions at which
they were expected, given their presence in other species
[51]. To determine the origins of AAT genes, the gene family phylogeny was reconciled with the simple species tree
known for these organisms ([[T. brucei, T. cruzi], L.
major]). Reconciliation analysis was executed by
NOTUNG 2.1 [52], using default event costs. As this
required a fully resolved, binary tree, the ML topology was
applied. Putative duplications were classified as transpositive, i.e., resulting from transposition from one genomic
position to another, or tandem, i.e., resulting from duplication in cis at the same position.
Relative rate analysis
Phylogenetic trees contain a temporal component that
may provide evidence of non-random changes in evolutionary rate along a branch. The phylogeny estimated here
was split into 26 subclades to partition sequences into
groups of close relatives, plus appropriate outgroups.
These outgroups had to be robustly placed with the
ingroup, not too distant to cause inaccurate measures of
genetic distance (i.e., exposure to substitution saturation),
but distant enough to offer a clear comparison between
members of the ingroup. Each subclade was analysed
using relative rate tests [53,54] with RRtree v1.1.11 [55].
The length of the branch leading to each sequence was
estimated using the number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site [56]. These values were
compared with close relatives to identify those lineages
that had experienced a significant change in evolutionary
rate, since sharing an ancestor [57]. Synonymous sites
were not used since these were saturated in places and
often could not be accurately estimated.

Assessment of concerted evolution
Concerted evolution occurs among repetitive sequences,
such as gene family members, where distinct sequences
within a genome become homogenised, losing the identity they should display towards orthologs in other
genomes [58,39]. Concerted evolution should result in
monophyly of all gene copies within a genome, relative to
copies at the same position in other genomes. To assess its
effect on tandem gene arrays, relevant loci in T. brucei were
combined in a ML phylogenetic tree with homologs from
the same genomic positions in close relatives T. congolense, T. vivax and T. cruzi (genome sequences retrieved
from GeneDB), using the same procedure described for
the gene family tree. Tandem gene arrays from L. major
were similarly compared with homologs from L. infantum
and L. braziliensis. The copy number of repetitive genes in
the T. cruzi genome sequence is not well characterised,
precluding analysis of this species. The significance of any
monophyly identified in the phylogenetic trees was
assessed using the SH test [59]; the likelihood of the
observed topology was compared with the likelihoods of
topologies forced to show monophyly by species (i.e.,
concerted evolution), or monophyly by position (i.e.,
retention of orthology).
Assessment of gene conversion
Gene conversion occurs through non-homologous
recombination between repetitive sequences, resulting in
the partial or total homogenisation of multiple sequences.
In the present context, it may affect gene family evolution
by exchanging sequence motifs among family members
within a genome, affecting their identities and phylogenetic relationships. To detect gene conversion events,
sequence alignments of all sequences were prepared for
each species individually. These were analysed within the
RDP v2.0 platform [60] using the GENECONV program
[61], which identifies strings of silent polymorphisms
shared in sequence triplets that exceed chance expectations. Putative conversion events were inspected by eye
and checked using a second method, SISCAN [62], which
applies a phylogenetic profile approach to identify
regions of an alignment that give a significantly different
phylogenetic signal to neighbouring regions. Both GENECONV and SISCAN assess the significance of putative conversion events with permutation tests, creating 1000
randomized data sets to assess the frequency with which a
given region of similarity occurs by chance.
