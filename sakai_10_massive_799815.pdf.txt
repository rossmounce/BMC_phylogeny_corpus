Massive gene losses in Asian cultivated rice
unveiled by comparative genome analysis
Hiroaki Sakai, Takeshi Itoh*

Abstract
Background: Rice is one of the most important food crops in the world. With increasing world demand for food
crops, there is an urgent need to develop new cultivars that have enhanced performance with regard to yield,
disease resistance, and so on. Wild rice is expected to provide useful genetic resources that could improve the
present cultivated species. However, the quantity and quality of these unexplored resources remain unclear. Recent
accumulation of the genomic information of both cultivated and wild rice species allows for their comparison at
the molecular level. Here, we compared the genome sequence of Oryza sativa ssp. japonica with sets of bacterial
artificial chromosome end sequences (BESs) from two wild rice species, O. rufipogon and O. nivara, and an African
rice species, O. glaberrima.
Results: We found that about four to five percent of the BESs of the two wild rice species and about seven
percent of the African rice could not be mapped to the japonica genome, suggesting that a substantial number of
genes have been lost in the japonica rice lineage; however, their close relatives still possess their counterpart
genes. We estimated that during evolution, O. sativa has lost at least one thousand genes that are still preserved in
the genomes of the other species. In addition, our BLASTX searches against the non-redundant protein sequence
database showed that disease resistance-related proteins were significantly overrepresented in the close relativespecific genomic portions. In total, 235 unmapped BESs of the three relatives matched 83 non-redundant proteins
that contained a disease resistance protein domain, most of which corresponded to an NBS-LRR domain.
Conclusion: We found that the O. sativa lineage appears to have recently experienced massive gene losses
following divergence from its wild ancestor. Our results imply that the domestication process accelerated largescale genomic deletions in the lineage of Asian cultivated rice and that the close relatives of cultivated rice have
the potential to restore the lost traits.

Background
With the worldwide demand for food crops increasing,
the genetic improvement of cereals has been considered
a promising approach to overcoming problems related
to food supplies for the past several decades [1].
Between 1966 and 2000, the Green Revolution increased
food production in densely populated developing countries by 125% [2]. The drastic improvement in crop
yields has saved people in those countries from largescale famine and economic upheaval [2]. However, the
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United
Nations estimated that 854 million people worldwide
remained undernourished from 2001 to 2003 http://

www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0750e/a0750e00.HTM. Moreover, the United Nations Population Division has predicted that the world’s population will increase from 6.5
billion in 2005 to 9.2 billion in 2050 http://www.un.org/
esa/population/publications/wpp2006/wpp2006.htm. We
will therefore need to produce 50% more grain supplies
by 2025 [3].
Because crop yields have suffered serious losses due to
various plant diseases, disease resistance has been one of
the most important challenges in ensuring stable food
supplies. It is estimated that diseases and insect pests
can cause losses of up to 25% per year [4]. A further
threat may be posed by global climate change [5], which
may affect crop yields in various ways, such as increasing the risk of plant diseases or causing direct damage
at specific developmental stages (e.g., flowering time)

[6]. For these reasons, the development of new cultivars
that show enhanced disease resistance, yield, and other
aspects of performance is urgently needed. Wild relatives of cultivated species are expected to contain a
wealth of genetic resources that are currently unexplored and may assist in the breeding of extant cultivars
[1]. Despite the possible agronomic importance of such
genetic resources, the amount and characteristics of
these resources are largely unknown [7]. In this paper,
we use a genome-wide comparative analysis to elucidate
the quantity and agronomic potential of genes specific
to wild rice species.
Asian cultivated rice, Oryza sativa L. (Os), contains
two major cultivar groups, japonica (Oj) and indica
(Oi), which are the most important grain crops and provide over 30% of the caloric intake in Asia http://www.
irri.org/science/ricestat/index.asp. Oj and Oi split about
400,000 years ago [8], and were independently domesticated about 10,000 years ago [9]. The two cultivars
show significant diversity in single nucleotide polymorphisms, intergenic sequences, and individual gene
duplications, suggesting that the genomes of Os have
undergone dynamic genome evolution [10]. In addition
to Os, the genus Oryza includes the African cultivated
rice, O. glaberrima (Og), as well as 22 wild species. The
species have been classified into 10 genome types on the
basis of chromosomal affinity during meiosis in experimental hybrids [11]. The O. sativa complex consists of
Os, Og, and five wild species that have the same AA
genome type. These species can be intercrossed, whereas
different genome types are incompatible because of
reproductive barriers [12]. Thus, two wild rice species of
this complex, the annual O. nivara (On) and the perennial O. rufipogon (Or), which are considered the progenitors of Os, can be utilised in hybridisation-based
breeding to develop new cultivars with favourable traits
[7]. The premise of such breeding efforts is that a considerable amount of useful genetic resources is preserved in wild species. During the domestication
process, rice appears to have undergone severe bottlenecks, which can be attributed to the initial cultivation
of limited numbers of individuals that possessed key
desirable traits, such as reduced grain shattering and
seed dormancy [1,7]. The subsequent modern breeding
process, which has been facilitated by extensive artificial
selection for desirable traits, has resulted in the rapid
loss of genetic diversity that was originally present in
the wild ancestral population [13]. Therefore, there may
be a significant number of genes that were not essential
to the initial cultivation and domestication process, but
that might be related to agronomically useful traits.
The term “wild rice-specific genes” can be used in two
distinct senses: loci and alleles. Whereas allelic variations among cultivars have been used in breeding to

Page 2 of 13

improve agronomically important traits [14-16], few
novel loci have been utilised. The discovery of wild ricespecific loci of agronomic importance would be beneficial to the genetic improvement of modern cultivars. In
order to examine this issue, the genome sequence of an
Asian cultivar, Nipponbare, which was released by the
International Rice Genome Sequencing Project and
annotated by the Rice Annotation Project (RAP) [17,18],
is compared with the genomes of its wild relatives. The
Oryza Map Alignment Project has made available a
large collection of bacterial artificial chromosome end
sequences (BESs) of wild rice species [19]. Herein, we
use Or, On, and Og BESs to identify lost genes in Oj
and Oi. The dynamic evolutionary changes evident in
the rice genomes are discussed.

Results
Genomic deletions in the genome of Oryza sativa L. ssp.
japonica

We mapped the BESs of two wild species, On and Or,
and of the African cultivated rice species, Og, to the
entire genome of Oj. The genome contigs of Oi were
also aligned to the Oj genome. We selected 15,053
codons using the Oj genome annotation and constructed
a phylogenetic tree of the five species using the maximum-parsimony (MP) method (Figure 1). Although a
previous report revealed that Oj and Oi were derived
independently from Or and On, respectively [20], the
phylogenetic tree shows that the two Asian cultivated
subspecies form the sister group of the wild rice species.
We note, however, that the bootstrap values are quite
low, as are the indices that measure the degree of
homoplasy (Figure 1). We also reconstructed phylogenetic trees using the neighbour-joining (NJ) and the
maximum-likelihood (ML) methods (Additional File 1).
As expected, all the internal branches were not supported by the bootstrap test in both the NJ and ML
trees. Several studies showed that the evolutionary relationship of the Oryza species is quite complicated and
difficult to solve unambiguously [21-23]. That difficulty
might be attributed to the lineage sorting [24]. Our
results indicate that the phylogenetic relationships
among Asian rice species cannot be uniquely determined by molecular sequence data, possibly because of
incomplete speciation, variable gene histories due to the
sorting of ancestral polymorphisms [25], or both.
The genomes of Oryza species vary in size. For example,
O. australiensis has the largest genome, which is 960 Mb
in size and is more than twice as large as the Oj genome
[26]. A recent study has revealed that this variation in genome size is mainly due to the increase in retrotransposable
elements in the O. australiensis lineage [26]. Thus, transposons may have caused the genome size differences
observed between Oj and its relatives. We found that

Figure 1 Phylogenetic tree of the five Oryza species used in
this study: Oj, O. sativa L. ssp. japonica; Oi, O. sativa L. ssp. indica;
On, O. nivara; Or, O. rufipogon; and Og, O. glaberrima. We employed
the maximum-parsimony method using the third positions of
15,053 codons. Bootstrap values are shown above the internal
branches. The scale indicates the branch length.

38.9% of the Oj genome is composed of repetitive elements. The proportions of repetitive sequences in the
BESs of On, Or, and Og are 39.7%, 39.1%, and 31.0%,
respectively. Because BESs were fragmented DNA derived
from genomes, these estimates may be biased. Therefore,
to assess our BES analyses, we generated simulated BESs
of Oj and Oi, and evaluated the amounts of repetitive
sequences (see Methods, and Additional File 2). The proportions of the repetitive sequences in the simulated BESs
of Oj (38.5%) and Oi (33.1%) were almost the same as
those derived from the genome sequences (38.9% for Oj
and 34.3% Oi), suggesting that the BESs of close relatives
reflect the actual compositions of the repetitive sequences
of the species used. The proportions of repeats in the two
wild rice species are quite close to that in Oj, whereas Og
possesses a relatively small fraction of repeats (Table 1).
Because the estimated genome size of Og is about 20%
smaller than those of the two wild rice species [27], the
difference in the genome sizes can be explained in part by
the differences in the amount of repetitive elements. By
contrast, because Oj, On, and Or have nearly identical frequencies of repeats, the differences in the genome size
between these species cannot be ascribed solely to
increased or decreased repetitive elements. The lower
repeat frequency of Oi than Oj may be because we did not
use the unassembled reads and the unmapped pieces in
which transposable elements were enriched [10]. Because
the overall distribution of repetitive elements was similar
among the examined species (Additional File 3), the differences in genome size do not seem to be due to expansion
of a specific type of transposon.
If the genome size variation was caused by the accumulation of successive short insertions and deletions
(indels), then the estimated insert lengths of the Or and

On clones should be substantially greater than the interval sizes of paired BESs on the Oj genome. However,
the average interval sizes of the two wild rice species on
the Oj genome were almost the same as the insert
length of the Or clones and were very close to that of
the On clones (Additional File 4). In addition, although
random indels in the two lineages should result in an
equal amount of unique genomic regions in both species, the total genome lengths shared between Oj and its
wild relatives (241, and 242 Mbp for On, and Or,
respectively) were estimated to be nearly equal to the
non-repetitive portion of the Oj genome (241 Mbp)
(Figure 2). This finding indicates that only the wild rice
genomes have retained a substantial quantity of unique
regions, whereas the extant Oj genome lacks them (Figure 2). This observation suggests that only the Oj genome has undergone deletions that are larger in size than
BAC clones, possibly during the domestication process.
By contrast, the average interval size of Og was significantly greater than the estimated insert length (Additional File 4). If we take into consideration the fact that
Og has fewer repeats than Oj, it appears that the difference in genome size between Oj and Og can be largely
attributed to the successive accumulation of small-scale
indels derived from repetitive sequences. Likewise, we
estimated shared and unique genomic portions between
Oj and Oi, using the mapping result of simulated BESs
of Oi (Additional File 5).
Of the total BESs used for mapping, 10.9% and 9.5% of
On and Or sequences, respectively, failed to be mapped
to the Oj genome under the criteria of 80% identity and
70% coverage. Some BESs might have remained
unmapped because of large alignment gaps that were
derived from long DNA insertions into the Oj genome
after the species split. However, even under the relaxed
criteria of 80% identity and 30% coverage, 5.2% and 4.0%
of the BESs of On and Or, respectively, could not be
mapped (Table 1). Hence, our conservative estimate indicates that about 5% of the ancestral genome was lost in
the Oj lineage after the divergence between Oj and its
wild relatives. Likewise, 6.7% of the Og genome was missing in the Oj genome. Nonetheless, the unmapped BESs
may have been conserved in the independent Oi lineage.
In fact, of the 3,992, 2,056, and 3,609 unmapped BESs of
On, Or, and Og, respectively, we found that 1,775, 1,047,
and 880 BESs matched the Oi genome sequence under
the criteria of 80% nucleotide identity and 30% sequence
coverage. These results indicate that certain genome fractions were deleted only in the Oj lineage, following the
divergence of the japonica and indica groups.

follows:
ng  d  L  r;

where d is the gene density of non-repetitive regions,
L is the genome size, and r is the ratio of the non-repetitive regions to the total DNA. Given that the total
number of Oj genes is ~32,000 [18], that the genome
size is 382 Mbp, and that the ratio of non-repetitive
DNA to total DNA is 0.61, d of Oj is 1.37 × 10 -4 per
site. The gene densities of On, Or, and Og were estimated by counting the numbers of BESs that overlapped

with protein-coding regions on the Oj genome, and then
calculating the ratios of BESs of each species to simulated BESs of Oj (see Table 2, Methods, and Additional
File 6). The genome sizes of On, Or, and Og were estimated to be 448, 439, and 354 Mbp [27], and the ratios
of non-repetitive DNA to total DNA were 0.603, 0.609,
and 0.690, respectively (Table 2). Therefore, the numbers of genes in the genomes of On, Or, and Og were
estimated to be 42,356, 41,422, and 35,553, respectively
(Table 2). We note here that the unmapped BESs contained fewer protein-coding genes than the mapped
BESs. Natural selection against the loss of genes may
reasonably account for this biased gene density. To take
the biased gene distribution into account, we counted
the number of BESs for which matches were found to
sequence(s) in the non-redundant protein database (nr)
of the National Center for Biotechnology Information.
The ratio of the number (nu) of genes in the wild ricespecific regions to the number (n m ) of genes in the
shared regions should be equal to the ratio of the nr
hits (h u ) of unmapped BESs to the nr hits (h m ) of
mapped BESs, and therefore:
n u  n m  hu / hm .

By substituting nm with ng - nu, we obtain
n u  n g  h u / (h m  h u ).

We regarded “ambiguous” BESs (Table 1) as mapped
BESs, so that the estimated numbers of unique genes
would be conservative. As a result, we estimated that
1,360, 934, and 1,260 genes lost in Oj have been preserved in On, Or, and Og, respectively (Table 2). Likewise, the number of genes lost in the Oi genome was
estimated (Table 2). In addition, to count all the possible candidates, we also estimated the numbers of unique
genes, regarding the ambiguously mapped BES as

Functional biases of genes lost in the Asian cultivated
rice lineage

Next, we turned our attention to the functional characteristics of the wild rice-specific gene regions. It was difficult to directly infer the functions of the wild ricespecific genes because the BESs were generally short,
fragmented genomic sequences that did not cover a
complete gene region. Therefore, we devised an indirect
classification method in which the function of the most
homologous protein in the nr database was used. Our
BLASTX searches of unmapped BESs against the nr
database revealed that 1,115 On, 531 Or, and 758 Og
BESs had significant hits with an E-value of less than
10-10 (Table 2). We also conducted BLASTN searches
against full-length cDNAs of Or [29], but no significant
hits were found. The functions of the BESs that encoded
proteins were predicted by InterProScan against their

1500

Number of unique genes

unmapped ones (Additional File 7). Because the ratio of
hu to hm depends on the criterion of similarity against
the nr database proteins, we tested several criteria and
obtained essentially the same results (Additional File 8).
Furthermore, we examined the portions of the genomes lost after the split of the japonica and indica cultivars. Using simulated BESs of Oj and Oi, we mapped the
BESs to the other genomes, and estimated the number
of unique genes in the Oi genome that are missing in
the Oj genome, and vice versa (Table 2). We used 466
Mbp as the genome size of Oi as reported by a previous
study [10]. It was revealed that Oj lost 980 genes, while
Oi lost 946, which are comparable with the numbers for
On, Or, and Og.
If a gene loss occurs in a selectively neutral manner,
the rate of the loss is constant, and the numbers of
genes lost in Oj and Oi should increase proportionally
with time. We assume that synonymous nucleotide substitutions are neutral, so that the number of substitutions corresponds to the elapsed time period. As
expected, a linear relationship between the numbers of
unique genes and synonymous substitutions was
observed (Figure 3). If genes had been lost constantly
throughout time, the regression line would cross the origin. However, Figure 3 indicates that the linear relationship is violated near the origin. This observation implies
that the rate of gene loss has recently accelerated in the
Asian cultivated rice lineage. It is possible that the rate
of gene losses fluctuated during long-term evolution,
and that the linear regression is not appropriate. However, it is rather difficult to imagine that genomic indel
rates drastically changed during short-term evolution.
Even if this was the case, our data clearly indicate that
the rate accelerated after the split of wild and cultivated
rice. The evolutionary distance between Oi and Or is 4.3
× 10 -3 substitutions per synonymous site. Therefore,
given that the nucleotide substitution rate in rice is
approximately 6.5 × 10-9 per synonymous site per year
[28], the acceleration seems to have occurred around
330,000 years ago or later.

homologues and subsequent Gene Ontology (GO) categorisation. We found that the overall pictures of the
classifications of Oj genes and mapped BESs were nearly
identical, and no statistically significant differences were
observed (Figure 4 and Additional File 9). By contrast,
among the 15 categories of molecular functions, genes
with a “binding” function (GO:0005488) were overrepresented in the BESs unique to On (p = 1.0 × 10-4), Or (p
= 1.1 × 10-4) and Og (p = 3.9 × 10-3). Similarly, when
mapping all BESs to the Oi genome, we found that the
Oi genome has lost a significant number of “binding"related genes (Additional File 10). Functional classification of simulated BESs of Oj and Oi resulted in similar
compositions. This result implies that the two subspecies of Os possess a certain number of binding-related
genes that are missing in either genome (Additional File
11).
In order to investigate the detailed functions of these
“binding” proteins, we examined the individual InterPro domains observed. We found that similar functions were listed for the 10 most frequently detected
domains among the three species (Table 3 and Additional File 12). These domains may have appeared on
the list by chance, because a large gene family has
more opportunities to be deleted if deletion events
occur randomly. Therefore, the excess of functional

categories in the On-, Or- and Og-specific proteins was
validated by Fisher’s exact test. We found that three
domains, leucine-rich repeat (IPR001611), NB-ARC
(nucleotide-binding adaptor shared by apoptotic protease activating factor-1, R proteins, and Caenorhabditis elegans cell death gene 4) (IPR002182), and Nterminal leucine-rich repeat (IPR013210), were significantly overrepresented in each of the three species (p
< 10-3) (Table 3 and Additional File 12). It should be
noteworthy that the genes with nucleotide-binding site
(NBS) and/or leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains are
known to be related only to disease resistance [30].
Thus, our finding suggests that several types of gene
were deleted in the lineage leading to Asian cultivated
rice, whereas a substantial number of disease resistance
genes were preserved in On, Or, and Og. In total, 235
unmapped BESs of the three species were matched to
83 nr database proteins with a disease resistance protein domain (IPR000767), most of which were the
NBS-LRR type (Additional File 13).
Phylogenetic analysis of wild rice-specific genes

Molecular phylogenetic trees are expected to show
clear-cut evidence of gene losses in a large gene family.
Figure 5 shows an example of a phylogenetic tree that
includes protein sequences encoded in an On-specific
DNA fragment, CL716448. This BES is missing in the
Oj genome, but is homologous to a hexaploid wheat
protein, LRR14, which contains an NBS-LRR domain
[31] with high amino acid identity (62%). The amino
acid alignment showed that CL716448 also contains
part of the leucine-rich repeat domain of LRR14 (Additional File 14). Another hexaploid wheat protein
(LRR19) and a barley homologue (AAD46469) were
placed near LRR14 in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 5). If
an orthologue had been retained in the japonica lineage,
there would be an Oj sequence next to CL716448 in the
phylogenetic tree. However, because there are no homologues in Os, it appears that the orthologue to
CL716448 was lost from the Os lineage after the species
split.
To obtain a conservative estimate of the number of wild
rice-specific genes, we applied a relaxed threshold to
map BESs onto the Oj genome. Therefore, there may be
other candidate genes that were erroneously mapped.
These might be detected by careful checking of their
molecular phylogeny. In fact, a BES from On, CL619881,
was mapped to the Oj genome and matched an Oj gene,
BAD33147, with 84% amino acid identity. However, the
large evolutionary distance of 0.145 between CL619881
and BAD33147 clearly indicates that BAD33147 is not
an orthologue of CL619881 (Additional File 15). Thus, a
reasonable evolutionary scenario is that BAD33147 was
duplicated before divergence of the On and Oj lineages,

and the Oj orthologue to CL619881 was subsequently
lost. Because CL619881 is found in a group of genes
related to Pib, which is known to be an effective disease
resistance gene against rice blast, this On gene might
encode an agronomically useful trait. If we apply more
stringent criteria to map BESs onto the Oj genome,
more wild rice-specific genes that have the potential to
genetically improve modern cultivated rice may be
identified.

Discussion
Drastic genome-wide deletions in Asian cultivated rice

Although grass genomes have been suggested to be evolutionarily stable [32], genome-wide studies in a variety
of species, including rice, have shown dynamic evolution
of their genome structures [10,33,34]. Our comparative
analyses between cultivated and wild rice species
revealed that Asian cultivated rice species have accumulated genomic deletions since their divergence from

their wild ancestors. However, the deleted genes may
have been preserved in other closely related species. In
fact, we found that the genomes of wild rice species harbour about one thousand unique genes, which account
for 3% of the total genes of the ancestor of Oj. These
estimated numbers of the unique genes depended on
the genome sizes based on the flow cytometry [27].
Although flow cytometry was later found to have overestimated the genome size of Oj, the difference was
quite small (1.29%) [17]. This indicates that our estimates were not affected largely by possible overestimations of the genome sizes. Thus, it appears that the
Asian cultivated rice lineage underwent these drastic
changes over a relatively short period of time. Additionally, because large-scale deletions, rather than successive
small-scale deletions, were found, the changes may have
occurred in a relatively small number of steps.
The linear relationship between the number of lost
genes and synonymous substitutions suggests selective
neutrality of the deletion events (Figure 3). This hypothesis is consistent with our finding that the fraction of
unmapped BESs that matched nr database proteins was
less than that of mapped BESs (28% vs. 47% for On, and
26% vs. 46% for Or). Deletions of protein-coding regions
were selected against, whereas non-coding regions that
were functionally less important for the species were
more likely to be lost from the genome. By contrast, the
rate of recent gene losses seems to be accelerated in the
Os lineage. This observation may be related to our finding that some functional domains are overrepresented
among the deleted genes (Figure 4, Table 3, Additional
File 9, and Additional File 12). In particular, NBS-LRRtype disease resistance genes seem to have been prone
to elimination from the Oj genome. It is possible that
these disease resistance genes were artificially overrepresented because of the biases in the collection of the
BESs examined. However, the BESs are randomly distributed throughout the genome (Additional File 16). In
addition, the functional classifications of the mapped
BESs of the three close relatives were almost the same
as the classification of the Oj genes (Figure 4 and Additional File 9), indicating that there were no obvious
biases and that the current BES set represented the
overall characteristics of the genes of the three close
relatives.
The accelerated reductive evolution might be due in
part to purifying selection against the disease resistance
genes. It is intuitively expected that disease resistance
genes should have been fully utilised in cultivated rice
because of their agronomical importance. However, a
study in Arabidopsis thaliana has shown that the fitness
costs of resistance tend to decrease the presence of disease resistance genes [35]. During the domestication
process, Asian cultivated rice may have had less contact

Page 8 of 13

with pathogens in the human-controlled environment.
Thus, disease resistance genes may have imposed a cost
on the fitness in the cultivated species.
A selectively neutral process of accelerated rice genome reduction may be possible if we consider gene deletions in large gene families, such as NBS-LRR. It is
known that NBS-LRR genes were subjected to birthand-death evolution, where some genes in a gene family
were maintained in the genome, while others were
deleted or become nonfunctional [36,37]. In fact, 32% of
the NBS-LRR genes of Oj were shown to be nonfunctional [38]. Thus, one possible explanation is that rapid
turnover following the high rate of nonfunctionalisation
has led to the elimination of NBS-LRR genes in the Oj
genome. Genetic recombination is one of the mechanisms that contribute to the evolution of NBS-LRR genes
in plants [37,39]. Because NBS-LRR genes have frequently been amplified and, in many cases, are arrayed
in tandem, a possible mechanism for the elimination of
these genes is unequal crossing-over. In fact, Chin et al.
reported that unequal crossing-over led to deletion of
the lettuce disease resistance gene, Dm3 [40]. Another
possible reason for the gene deletions in rice is that the
mating system of rice has rapidly changed from outbreeding to inbreeding during domestication. This
hypothesis is supported by the observation that Dm3
was eliminated in an inbred line [40]. Cytological and
theoretical studies have demonstrated that self-fertilisation enhances the frequency of recombination [41,42].
Therefore, the increased self-fertilisation rate may have
led to a high frequency of unequal crossing-over in the
Os genome, resulting in the rapid loss of NBS-LRR
genes. When we conducted BLASTN searches between
the unmapped BESs of On and Or, the result showed
that 22% of the On unmapped BESs and 33% of the Or
unmapped BESs hit to each other. Furthermore, NBS or
LRR domains were frequent among the hit BESs, suggesting that these genes were commonly preserved in
the genomes of the wild rice species. It is generally
accepted that the domestication of rice began approximately 10,000 years ago [9]. Although the loss of a great
number of genes over such a short period may appear
implausible, the fact that the loss of Dm3 in the lettuce
genome occurred in merely four generations [40] suggests that drastic large-scale deletions may be ubiquitous
in cultivated species.
Wild rice germplasm as a reservoir of genes of agronomic
importance

For the breeding of modern food crops, in addition to
extant cultivars, wild species are abundant genetic
resources that have been largely unexplored to date.
Therefore, in this study, we focus on the quantity and
quality of genes that have been lost from the genomes

Sakai and Itoh BMC Genomics 2010, 11:121
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/121

of Asian cultivated rice but are preserved in its relatives.
Among the promising candidate genes that we have
found are a significant number of possible novel disease
resistance genes, such as homologues of Pib and PibH8
(Additional File 15), which are well-studied disease resistance genes against rice blast [43]. In this study, we have
examined only three accessions of three species. We
expect that there are many undiscovered useful genes
and allelic variations in wild rice.
Because all three relatives analysed in this study have
the same AA genome type as Os, the genes found to be
unique to the genomes of the three relatives can be
transferred to the Os genome by conventional hybridisation-based approaches. The recent development of
introgression lines of elite cultivars and wild rice species
has facilitated the efficient detection of quantitative trait
loci associated with yield-related and other morphological or physiological traits [44,45]. Therefore, the introgression lines can be used to further examine the
functions of the candidate genes identified in our analyses. As shown by the transfer of a bacterial blight
resistance gene, Xa1, from indica to japonica [46], the
transgenic approach may also be useful for examining
the functions of the candidate genes and for conferring
beneficial traits to the species of interest.

Conclusion
Throughout this study, we have emphasized the importance of novel genetic resources in species that have not
been examined in depth at the molecular level. We
found that many potentially useful genes remain unexplored in the wild relatives of Asian cultivated rice.
Hence, the complete genome sequencing of a wide variety of wild rice species should further expedite genomic
breeding, as well as comprehensive analyses of gene
function [27,47]. The high-throughput sequencing of
rice species will unveil the retained genetic resources
and will promote the development of new cultivated
rice varieties.
Methods
Sequence data and alignment

We used genome assembly build 4 of Oryza sativa L.
ssp. japonica (Oj), which was released by the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project [17]. From
DDBJ release 70, we extracted the following numbers of
bacterial artificial chromosome end sequences (BESs)
generated by the Oryza Map Alignment Project [11,19]:
106,124 of O. nivara (On); 70,982 of O. rufipogon (Or);
and 66,821 of O. glaberrima (Og). The length distributions of the BESs of each species are shown in Additional File 17. The genome of O. sativa ssp. indica (Oi)
was downloaded from DDBJ under the accession numbers CM000126-CM000137. Repetitive regions were

Page 9 of 13

masked in lower case using RepeatMasker (A.F. Smit
and P. Green, unpublished) with the MIPS Repeat Element Database (mips-REdat) [48]. All sequences having
<30 bp of non-repetitive nucleotide sequence were
excluded from our analyses. In order to estimate the
amounts of undetected repeats, we conducted all-to-all
BLASTN searches of the BESs in each species. When
we applied the threshold of nucleotide identity ≥95%
and aligned length ≥100 bp, about 3-6% of the BESs had
three or more hits. We further conducted BLASTX
searches for these possibly repetitive BESs against the nr
database, and found a number of BESs that hit to members of multi-gene families such as kinases. Hence, the
fractions of undetected repeats seemed to be smaller,
possibly a few percents, so that they did not largely
affect our results. The positions of the BESs in the genome were primarily determined by BLASTN searches
[49]. We used thresholds of ≥80% identity and ≥70%
coverage. To obtain conservative estimates of genes
missing in Asian cultivated rice, we defined unmapped
BESs as those with identity of <80% or coverage of
<30%. BESs that satisfied either identity of ≥80% or coverage of ≥30%, and that did not satisfy the thresholds of
≥80% identity and ≥70% coverage were classified as
“ambiguous.” Regions conserved between Oj and the
other species were estimated on the basis of the fractions of mapped BESs. The sizes (RC) of the conserved
regions were calculated as follows:
R C  L  r  m;

where L is the genome size, r is the fraction of nonrepetitive sequences, and m is the fraction of mapped
BESs. The genome sizes of Kim, H. et al. were used
[27]. Genome-wide alignments between Oj and Oi were
constructed using BLASTZ with the options of “C = 0,
H = 2000, Y = 3400, and T = 4” [50,51]. Some
unmapped BESs hit to rice proteins in the nr database
(see “ Functional classification of genes encoded in
BESs”). However, the numbers of the hits were very
small (24, 19, and 24 for On, Or, and Og, respectively),
and they were negligible in our estimations.
Simulation study

We generated simulated BESs of Oj and Oi from the
genome sequences by extracting the same numbers of
sequence fragments as the total number (243,927) of
BESs of three close relatives with the same lengths. To
randomly select DNA fragments, we used the Mersenne
Twister algorithm as the uniform pseudorandom number generator [52]. We selected fragments without any
ambiguous nucleotides, such as N. To confirm the efficiency of our BES mapping, we aligned the simulated
BESs of Oj to the Oj genome, and Oi to the Oi genome.

Sakai and Itoh BMC Genomics 2010, 11:121
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/121

In addition, we randomly introduced nucleotide mutations in the simulated BESs of Oj so that the number of
substitutions became 0.025 that was equal to the average
number of nucleotide differences between Oj and Og. As
a result, we confirmed that 99.9% of the simulated BESs
as well as artificially mutated BESs were successfully
mapped (Additional File 2).
Molecular evolutionary analyses

BESs that were mapped to multiple positions with the
same identity and coverage were discarded from the
dataset. If multiple BESs were mapped to the same
genomic position, the BES with the highest nucleotide
identity against Oj was selected. The four pairwise alignments between Oj and the other species were compared,
and the regions that were covered by all five species
were used. We made multiple alignments for these segments using Clustal W (ver. 1.83) [53]. The positions of
the protein-coding regions were determined based on
the genome annotation of Oj, which was released by the
Rice Annotation Project Database (RAP-DB) [54]. We
used the protein-coding regions to construct a phylogenetic tree. Genes containing one or more gaps or internal stop codons were excluded. The alignments were
concatenated into one large multiple sequence alignment. MP and NJ trees were constructed using MEGA4
[55]. A ML tree was reconstructed using PAUP* 4.0b10
[56]. We used only the third positions of the codons.
In order to investigate the relationship between evolutionary distances and the numbers of close relative-specific genes, we calculated the numbers of synonymous
substitutions in the five species by the Nei-Gojobori
method [57].
Estimation of gene densities

Weight factors of gene densities of each species other
than Oryza sativa were estimated as follows:
(N pc / N all ) / ( J pc / J all )

where N pc is the number of BESs that overlap with
RAP protein-coing regions more than 50 bp on the Oj
genome, Nall is the number of all BESs used for mapping, J pc is the number of simulated BESs of Oj that
overlap with RAP protein-coding regions more than 50
bp, and Jall is the number of all simulated BESs of Oj.
The gene densities of non-Oj species were the Oj gene
density multiplied by a weight factor.
Functional classification of genes encoded in BESs

To infer the functions of genes encoded in mapped and
unmapped BESs, we conducted BLASTX searches
against the non-redundant protein sequence database
(nr) using a threshold E-value of < 1.0 × 10-10. The best

Page 10 of 13

homologues of the BESs reported by BLASTX were
used for indirect functional inference. Because the Oj
genome is about 5% incomplete [17], there may be
unmapped BESs that correspond to unsequenced portions of the genome. In fact, some unmapped BESs
matched the rice proteins in the nr database with high
identities. Therefore, we excluded those possibly
mapped BESs from our analysis of gene functions. We
chose threshold amino acid identities of 96.0%, 95.8%,
and 94.5% for On, Or, and Og BESs, respectively, so that
5% of the homologous BESs of each species were discarded (Additional File 18). The detected proteins and
the representative Oj proteins from the RAP-DB annotation were subjected to InterProScan searches [58]. On
the basis of the Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy, the
functions were categorised by the map2slim program
with generic GO slims. Proteins that were classified as
transposable elements (GO:0003964 and GO:0004803)
were excluded. The functional classifications of the proteins were compared between the Oj proteins and the
mapped or unmapped BESs.
To verify the validity of this indirect method, we compared the direct and indirect functional classifications of
the rice protein sets obtained from RAP-DB. Because
the rice proteins themselves were included in the nr
database, all self-hits were discarded. We confirmed that
there was no significant difference between the classifications (Additional File 19). Therefore, the indirect
functional inference should correctly reflect the actual
function.

the numbers of unique genes depend on the ratio of hu to hm, we
examined two other thresholds for similarity searches against the nr
database, an E-value of < 1.0 × 10-20 and < 1.0 × 10-50, in addition to an
E-value of < 1.0 × 10-10. Although the ratios slightly decreased with
stringent thresholds, the numbers of unique genes did not drastically
change, suggesting that the three close relatives possess ~1,000 unique
