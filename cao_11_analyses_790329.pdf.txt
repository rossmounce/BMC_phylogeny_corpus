Analyses of the oligopeptide transporter gene
family in poplar and grape

Abstract
Background: Oligopeptide transporters (OPTs) are a group of membrane-localized proteins that have a broad
range of substrate transport capabilities and that are thought to contribute to many biological processes. The OPT
proteins belong to a small gene family in plants, which includes about 25 members in Arabidopsis and rice.
However, no comprehensive study incorporating phylogeny, chromosomal location, gene structure, expression
profiling, functional divergence and selective pressure analysis has been reported thus far for Populus and Vitis.
Results: In the present study, a comprehensive analysis of the OPT gene family in Populus (P. trichocarpa) and Vitis
(V. vinifera) was performed. A total of 20 and 18 full-length OPT genes have been identified in Populus and Vitis,
respectively. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that these OPT genes consist of two classes that can be further
subdivided into 11 groups. Gene structures are considerably conserved among the groups. The distribution of OPT
genes was found to be non-random across chromosomes. A high proportion of the genes are preferentially
clustered, indicating that tandem duplications may have contributed significantly to the expansion of the OPT
gene family. Expression patterns based on our analyses of microarray data suggest that many OPT genes may be
important in stress response and functional development of plants. Further analyses of functional divergence and
adaptive evolution show that, while purifying selection may have been the main force driving the evolution of the
OPTs, some of critical sites responsible for the functional divergence may have been under positive selection.
Conclusions: Overall, the data obtained from our investigation contribute to a better understanding of the
complexity of the Populus and Vitis OPT gene family and of the function and evolution of the OPT gene family in
higher plants.

Background
Substrate transport is vital for all living organisms, and
many transporters play important roles in this process.
More than 600 transporter families are currently documented in the Transporter Classification Database
(TCDB) [1,2]. These protein families are further classed
into seven subclasses (channels/pores, electrochemical
potential-driver transporters, primary active transporters,
group translocators, transport electron carriers, accessory factors involved in transport, and incompletely
characterized transport systems). In general, they have
specific localizations within the cell and are specialized
to carry different compounds, including nitrate,

phosphate, sucrose, amino acids, peptides, hormones or
metals.
The peptide transporter family consists of electrochemical potential-driven transporters that catalyze uptake
of their solutes by a cation-solute symport mechanism
[3]. In plants, peptide transporters can be classified into
three distinct groups based on sequence similarity and
mechanism of action, namely the ATP-binding cassette
family, the peptide transporter family and the oligopeptide transporter (OPT) family. The plant ATP-binding
cassette proteins use the energy generated by ATP
hydrolysis to drive the transport of substrates such as
peptides, metal chelates or glutathione conjugates [4].
The peptide transporters have been shown to transport
nitrate, and di- and tripeptides [5,6]. Members of the
OPT family were first characterized in yeast [7,8], and
since then they have also been found in archaea, bacteria and plants. Phylogenetic analyses of plant OPT

members have revealed two distant clades: the yellow
stripe-like (YSL) proteins and the OPTs. The YSL transporters are involved in metal homeostasis through the
translocation of metal-chelates [9-16]. The OPT proteins
likely do not have a common biological function and
may be involved in four different processes: long-distance metal distribution [17], nitrogen mobilization
[18-21], heavy metal sequestration [19,21-23], and glutathione transport [19,21,22,24]. These processes may
play a role in plant growth and development [see [25]
for review].
Structurally, OPT proteins are predicted to have about
16 transmembrane strands (TMS). Through detailed
bioinformatic analyses of these transporters, Gomolplitinant and Saier [26] suggested that the 16-TMS proteins
might have arisen from a 2-TMS precursor-encoding
genetic element that was subject to three sequential
duplication events. Since the transporters are predicted
to function in peptide uptake, the expansion or fusion
of the TMS might make excellent physiological sense in
evolution.
The structural features or expression profiles of some
OPT homologs have been partially described in Arabidopsis [18] and rice [23]. Hoverer, there is much less
information about this family in woody plant species
such as Populus trichocarpa (poplar) and Vitis vinifera
(grape). In the present study, we performed a genome-

wide identification of OPT family genes in Populus and
Vitis. Detailed analyses including sequence phylogeny,
gene organization, conserved motifs, expression profiling, functional divergence and adaptive evolution were
performed. Our results should provide a framework for
further functional investigations on these genes.

Results and Discussion
Identification of the OPT gene family in Populus and Vitis

To identify members of the OPT gene family in Populus
and Vitis, we first searched relevant databases using the
corresponding Arabidopsis and rice OPT protein
sequences as queries. Additional searches were also performed based on keyword querying. The Populus and
Vitis sequences returned from such searches were confirmed as encoding OPTs using the CDD (Conserved
Domain Database) [27,28] and Pfam http://pfam.sanger.
ac.uk/ databases. As a result of this process, we identified 20 OPT genes in Poplar (Table 1) and 18 in Vitis
(Table 2). The number of OPT genes present in the
Arabidopsis and rice genomes was reported to be 12
and 25, respectively [18,23]. The OPT genes in Vitis and
Populus encode highly hydrophobic polypeptides (grand
average hydrophobicities of 0.329 to 0.628) ranging from
372 to 760 amino acids in length, with predicted pIs
ranging from 5.45 to 9.44. The polypeptides were also
predicted to contain from 8-16 transmembrane helices

(TMHs) (Tables 1 and 2). Further analyses using the
protein subcellular localization prediction software
WoFL PSORT http://wolfpsort.org enabled us to predict
the probable protein localization for each of the different candidate OPTs in Vitis and Populus. It was found
that all candidate OPTs identified in our study are most
likely to be localized in the plasma or vacuolar membranes. PtOPT1, PtOPT4, VvOPT4 and VvOPT9 had a
100% probability of being localized to the plasma membrane. For all other OPTs, although the plasma membrane was predicted as the most likely location, it is also
possible that they are localized to the membranes of
organelles such as the chloroplast, nucleus or Golgi
apparatus (Tables 1 and 2).
Phylogenetic analyses, classification and functional
relatedness of the OPT genes in Arabidopsis, rice,
Populus and Vitis

To examine the phylogenetic relationships among the
OPT genes in Arabidopsis, rice, Populus and Vitis, we
performed phylogenetic analyses of the OPT protein
sequences from all four species based on a maximum
likelihood method using PhyML 3.0 [29] and Bayesian
analyses using PhyloBayes 3 [30]. Our results show that
the OPT genes from the four higher plants consist of
two major clades: the OPT and YSL classes. In this
study, we further divide the YSL class into six subclasses
according to their phylogenetic relationships and they
are designated as Groups 1-6. The OPT class is also
further divided into five subclasses, namely Groups 7-11
(Figure 1). The relationships of OsYSL1 with other OPT

genes, however, cannot be confidently determined in
our analyses: OsYSL1 was basal to a large clade consisting of Groups 2-6 with weak support in the maximum
likelihood analyses, but formed a clade with Group 1 in
Bayesian analyses. Therefore, OsYSL1 is not classified
into any group in this study. Most of the designated
groups are supported by decent bootstrap values and/or
posterior probabilities. Moreover, other lines of evidence, such as gene structure and motif compositions as
described below, also support the group classification in
our analyses. Groups 4, 6 and 10 constitute the largest
clades in the OPT phylogeny, each containing 11 members. Additionally, Groups 5 and 6 form a well supported clade in the maximum likelihood analyses,
suggesting that they likely evolved from a common
ancestor by frequent gene duplication.
Genes with same functions often are closely related
and this has been confirmed in previous reports
[18,23,31,32]. Such a trend is also found in the OPT
genes. For instances, Group 4 includes the AtYSL1 and
AtYSL3 proteins, both of which are involved in metal
ion homeostasis and the loading of metal ions in seeds
[33,34]. AtYSL1 and AtYSL3 proteins also have dual
roles in reproduction: their activity in leaves is required
for normal fertility and normal seed development, while
their activity in inflorescences is required for proper
loading of metals into seeds [35]. Another member in
this group, OsYSL2, has metal-nicotianamine transport
activities in heterologous expression systems [12].
AtOPT6, a member of Group 9, is able to transport glutathione derivatives and metal complexes under sulfur-

respectively. The 11 major groups designated from 1 to 11 are marked with different color backgrounds. Exon/intron structures of the OPT

deprived conditions and may be involved in stress resistance, whereas AtOPT7 of Group 8 is not involved in
stress resistance [19,21]. The high AtOPT6 expression
reported in the vasculature of roots, stems and leaves
also suggests that this protein is involved in long-distance peptide transport or distribution throughout the
plant [19,20].
Phylogenetic analyses can allow us to identify evolutionarily conservative and divergent OPT genes.
Remarkably, Groups 1 and 2 do not include any Arabidopsis, Vitis or Populus OPT proteins but contain only
proteins from rice. Likewise, Group 9 does not include
any rice OPT proteins but contains only proteins from
Populus, Vitis and Arabidopsis. It is possible that these
groups have evolved after monocot-dicot divergence and
that they have specialized roles in monocots or dicots.
Our phylogenetic analyses also show that Groups 4 and
5 contain sequences from rice, Vitis and Populus but
not from Arabidopsis, indicating that they were either
acquired in rice, Vitis and Populus or lost in Arabidopsis. Although enormous evidences indicates that all
these OPT genes encode membrane proteins that translocate their substrates from either the extracellular
environment or an organelle into the cytosol, their exact
functional roles are different [9-17,19,20]. The phylogenetic analyses conducted in our study may also provide
potential support for their functional differentiation.
Additional evidence supporting this notion comes from
the tissue-specific expression profiling available on
GENEVESTIGATOR [36] and the extremely different
expression pattern of OPTs in rice (see additional file 1:
Microarray based expression profiles of rice OPT genes
across a variety of tissue or organs). For example,
OsYSL15 is specifically highly expressed in rhizomes,
suggesting a specific role in root development. While
OsYSL1, OsYSL3, OsYSL4, OsYSL7, OsYSL8 and
OsYSL11 show higher expression levels in pollen, indicating a key role in pollen development or reproduction.
Our phylogenetic analyses also show that several pairs
of OPT proteins are putative paralogs (Figure 1). These
putative paralogous OPT proteins account for over
44.4%, 40%, 33.3% and 40% of the entire OPT family in
Vitis, Populus, Arabidopsis and rice, respectively, with
sequence identifies ranging from 61% to 98% (see additional file 2: Pairwise identities between homologous
pairs of OPT genes from Vitis, Populus, Arabidopsis
and rice). These paralogous OPT members are closely
related within the species, and have a very similar structure as described below (middle panel in Figure 1), indicating that they evolved from relatively recent gene
duplications. We also estimated the evolutionary dates
of the segmental duplication events using Ksas the proxy
for time (Table 3). Three of the four pairs (PtOPT1/
PtOPT5, PtYSL1/PtYSL2, PtYSL8/PtYSL9) in Populus

have very consistent K s values (from 0.24447 to
0.30110), suggesting that the duplication events in this
species occurred within the last 13.43 to 16.54 million
years. This period is consistent with the time (13 Ma)
when a recent large-scale genome duplication event is
thought to have occurred in Populus [37]. For rice, the
segmental duplication event was estimated to have
occurred between 27.04 to 106.11 Ma, following the
divergence of monocots and eudicots (170-235 Ma).
Among them, about half of the rice OPT duplication
events occurred approximately when grasses originated
(55-70 Ma) [38-40]. It is interesting that four of the
OPT gene duplications (PtOPT6/PtOPT7, VvOPT3/
VvOPT5, VvOPT10/VvOPT6, VvYSL2/VvYSL4) were
estimated to have occurred more recently (only about
1.58 to 5.97 Ma). These relatively recent duplications
were not found in Arabidopsis or rice. It is likely that
Arabidopsis and rice have subsequently suffered a high
level of gene loss [41].
Exon-intron evolution of the OPT family genes in
Arabidopsis, rice, Populus and Vitis

To investigate the mechanisms of the structural evolution of OPT paralogs, we compared the exon-intron
structure of individual OPT genes in Arabidopsis, rice,
Populus and Vitis. Figure 1 provides a detailed illustration of the distribution and position of introns within
each of the OPT paralogs. In general, the positions of
some spliceosomal introns are conserved in orthologous
genes from the four lineages. In many cases, not only is
the intron position shared, but the intron phase is
shared as well. Moreover, the conservation of the exonintron organization or gene structure in paralogous
genes is usually strong and sufficient to reveal evolutionary relationships of introns [42]. It is clear that

Cao et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:465
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/465

duplication plays an important role in the organization
of genes and that intron losses have occurred frequently
after segmental duplication [43]. Our study of AtOPT6/
AtOPT9 and OsOPT1/OsOPT8 duplication also suggests that this mechanism underlies the evolution of
these paralogs and intron losses are associated with
duplications (Figure 1). The phenomenon of intron loss
following gene duplication also occurred in the evolution of many other genes including the aromatic amino
acid hydroxylase (AAAH) family [44]. In general, the
structural diversity of gene family members provides a
mechanism for the evolution of multiple gene families,
while intron loss or gain can be an important step in
generating structural diversity and complexity [45,46]. In
this study, we analyzed the structural diversity of OPT
genes and found that intron loss/gain events occurred
during the expansion and structural evolution of OPT
paralogs. We found that most OPT genes in the same
subgroups/clades have similar coding sequences and a
very similar exon-intron structure, strongly supporting

Page 6 of 16

their close evolutionary relationship. The divergent gene
structures in the different phylogenetic subgroups may
represent gene family expansion from ancient paralogs
or multiple origins of gene ancestry.
Chromosomal location of the OPT genes and duplication
events in the genome

Genome-wide duplication events, gene loss and local
rearrangements have created the present complexities of
the genome. To further investigate the relationship
between the genetic divergence within the OPT family
and gene duplication and loss in the Populus and Vitis
genomes, we determined the chromosomal location of
each OPT gene. The results show that the OPT genes
are dispersed throughout the Populus and Vitis genomes. Three of the Populus OPT genes are localized to
unassembled genomic sequence scaffolds and thus could
not be mapped to any particular chromosome. The
other OPT genes are distributed unevenly among the
eight chromosomes of the Populus genome (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Chromosomal locations of the Populus OPT genes. The schematic diagram shows the 17 OPT genes mapped to 8 chromosomes.
Three remaining genes (PtYSL7, PtYSL8 and PtYSL9) are located on unassembled scaffolds. Homologous blocks derived from segmental
duplication are indicated using the same colors. The diagram of genome-wide chromosome organization resulting from genome duplication
events in Populus is adapted from Tuskan et al. (2006) [49].

Cao et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:465
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/465

Five OPT genes were identified on chromosome I, two
on each of chromosomes III, IV, V and XII, and only
one on each of chromosomes VI and II. For Vitis, 16
OPT genes were found on 8 of the 19 chromosomes;
three on each of chromosomes XVII and XVIII, two on
each of chromosomes I, II, XVI and XIX, and one on
each of chromosomes III and XIV (Figure 3). Two other
Vitis OPT genes could not to be assigned to a specific
chromosome.
Gene duplication events are thought to have frequently occurred in organismal evolution [47,48]. To
investigate the relationship between the OPT genes and
potential gene duplications within the genome, we also
compared the locations of OPT genes in duplicated
chromosomal blocks that were previously identified in
Populus, Vitis, Arabidopsis and rice [41,49-52]. The distribution of the OPT genes relative to the corresponding
duplicated chromosomal blocks is illustrated in Populus
(Figure 2), Vitis (Figure 3), Arabidopsis (see additional
file 3: Chromosomal locations of the Arabidopsis OPT
genes) and rice (see additional file 4: Chromosomal
locations of the rice OPT genes). This result suggests
that segmental duplication and transposition events are
not the major factors that led to the expansion of the
OPT gene family in the four higher plants. It may be
that dynamic changes occurred following segmental
duplication, leading to loss of many of the genes. Interestingly, we found that some OPT genes are located in
tandem clusters on the chromosomes; examples are
PtYSL1-PtYSL2, PtOPT8-PtOPT5, AtOPT9-AtOPT8,
OsYSL7-OSYSL8, OsYSL2-OsYSL15, OsYSL9-OsYSL16,

Page 7 of 16

OsYSL3-OsYSL4, OsOPT2-OsOPT3 and VvOPT1VvOPT2-VvOPT8 (Figure 2 and 3; see also additional
file 3: Chromosomal locations of the Arabidopsis OPT
genes and additional file 4: Chromosomal locations of
the rice OPT genes). Further analyses indicate that most
of the tandemly clustered OPT pairs share relatively
high similarities (mostly above 70%). Thus, we propose
that tandem duplications might have been an important
factor governing the expansion of the OPT gene family
in these species.
Conserved domains and motifs in OPT proteins

The major domains of the OPT proteins in Populus,
Vitis, Arabidopsis and rice were identified using CDD,
Pfam and SMART [27,28]. Our results show that all
OPT proteins in the four species possess only one characteristic and structurally conserved OPT domain essential for their transporter activity. While these tools are
suitable for defining the presence or absence of recognizable domains, they are unable to recognize smaller
individual motifs and more divergent patterns. Thus, we
further used the program MEME [53] to study the
diversification of OPT genes in Populus, Vitis, Arabidopsis and rice. Twenty distinct motifs were identified
in these genes (Figure 1). Details of the 20 motifs are
presented in additional file 5: Sequence logo and regular
expression of the different motifs identified in the OPT
gene family. As mentioned above, phylogenetic analyses
broadly divided the OPT genes from the four higher
plants into two major classes, the OPT class and the
YSL class. Noticeably, most of the closely related

Figure 3 Chromosomal locations of the Vitis OPT genes. The 16 OPT genes mapped to the 8 of the 19 grape chromosomes are shown. Two
remaining genes (VvOPT3 and VvOPT5) are located on unassembled scaffolds. Paralogous regions in the putative ancestral constituents of the
Vitis genome are depicted using the colors according to Jaillon et al. (2007) [41] and Licausi et al. (2010) [50].

Cao et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:465
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/465

members in each of these two main classes have common motif compositions, suggesting functional similarities among the OPT proteins within the same class
(Figure 1). Most members of OPT class possess 14
motifs, while most members of YSL class have 9 motifs.
Three of the motifs (motif 1, motif 2 and motif 7) are
shared by all OPT proteins. Whether the motifs that are
specific to the OPT class (motif 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16,
17, 18 and 19) or to the YSL class (motif 6, 8, 11, 13, 14
and 20) confer unique functional roles to the OPTs
remains to be further investigated. In any case, the conserved motifs in the OPT proteins from the same class
may provide additional support to results of the phylogenetic analyses. On the other hand, the divergence in
motif composition among different classes may indicate
that they are functionally diversified.

Differential expression profiles of the Populus and Vitis
OPT genes

Expression profiling can provide useful clues to gene
functions. To examine the expression patterns of the
OPT genes, we performed a comprehensive expression
analysis using some of the publicly available microarray
data for Populus and Vitis. In general, the expression
levels of most OPT genes in Populus peaked in shoot
apices, roots and internode 9 (Figure 4). Because these
are the growing points of plants, they are likely to need
more nutrients to ensure plant growth and differentiation. Because OPTs are membrane-localized proteins
and have a broad range of substrate transport capabilities, higher expression of OPTs in these parts might
contribute to many growth and developmental processes. Some OPTs seem not to follow this trend. For

example, PtOPT10 displayed especially high expression
levels in internode 2.
Grape and wine production is strongly affected by
environmental cues during the development of the
plant. Here, we also investigated the expression pattern
of the OPT genes in response to some abiotic stresses.
Because sunshine duration can affect the quality of
fruits, long daylight hours will cause grape plants to produce more carbohydrates (e.g. sucrose). Microarray data
indicate that some OPTs vary considerably in their
expression levels when exposed to long daylight (LD) or
short daylight (SD) (Figure 5A). VvOPT2, VvYSL3 and
VvYSL7 showed higher expression levels in LD compared with in SD. One possible explanation may be that,
in LD conditions, grape plants need more transporters
(such as the OPTs) to transport more oligonucleotide
peptides for increased carbohydrate synthesis. We also
examined the expression patterns of the Vitis OPTs
under different stress conditions. Interestingly, several
genes such as VvYSL1 and VvYSL2 showed low expression levels when treated with ABA, whereas a subset of
genes including VvYSL3, VvOPT6 and VvOPT10 displayed high expression levels under salt stress (Figure
5C). Similarly, several genes such as VvOPT3 and

Page 9 of 16

VvYSL7 demonstrated depressed expression patterns in
cold conditions. We further selected four growth phases
of the fruit to investigate the different expression of the
OPT genes in the fruit maturing process. These four
phases were green hard berry, green soft berry, pink soft
berry and red soft berry. As shown in Figure 5B, different expression levels of the OPTs genes were found in
the four different growth phases of the fruit, suggesting
divergent functions of the OPT members in the maturing process.
Duplicated genes may have different evolutionary fates
[54], which can be indicated by divergence in their
expression patterns. Because tandem duplications may
have governed the expansion of the OPT gene family,
we also investigated the expression profiles of the duplicated OPT gene pairs identified above in Populus and
Vitis. Our results show that none of the gene pairs
share similar expression patterns (Figure 4 and 5), indicating that substantial neofunctionalization may have
occurred during the subsequent evolution of the duplicated genes. It seems that the expression patterns of the
paralogs have diverged during long-term evolution, suggesting functional diversification of the duplicated genes
[55-58]. Such a process may increase the adaptability of

Next, we investigated whether amino acid substitutions
in the highly conserved OPT domain could have caused
adaptive functional diversification. Type-I functional
divergence between gene clusters of the OPT family was
estimated by posterior analysis using the program
DIVERGE [59,60], which evaluate the shifted evolutionary rate and altered amino acid properties. Comparisons
of thirty-five pairs of paralogous members and class
OPT/class YSL proteins were carried out and the rate of
amino acid evolution at each sequence position was estimated. Our results indicate that the coefficient of all
functional divergence (Î¸) values between these groups or
classes is less than 1 (Table 4). These observations indicate that there were significantly site-specific altered
selective constraints on most members of the OPT
family, leading to group-specific functional evolution
after diversification. Moreover, critical amino acid residues responsible for the functional divergence were predicted based on site-specific profiles in combination
with suitable cut-off values derived from the posterior
probability of each comparison. The results indicate distinct differences in the number and distribution of predicted sites for functional divergence within each pair.
For example, no critical amino acid site was predicted
for the sequences in the Group 2/5, 4/5 and 9/11 pairs
(Figure 1), while over 200 critical amino acids sites were
predicted for Group 2/7, 2/8, 2/9, 2/10, 2/11, 4/7, 4/8,
4/9, 4/10, 4/11, 5/7, 5/8, 5/9, 5/10, 5/11, 6/7, 6/8, 6/9
and 6/10 pairs. Interestingly, when the OPT sequences
in the OPT and YSL classes were compared, thirty-one
critical amino acid sites were predicted for Group 6/11
pairs. When a cut-off value of 0.7 was applied, only four
substitution sites were predicted, implying a lower evolutionary rate between the two pairs.
During a long period of evolution, the different evolutionary rates at specific amino acid sites within each
pair might promote the functional divergence of OPT
subfamilies. In Table 4, we also find that higher theta
values (Î¸) exist in Group 2/8 (0.9992) and Group 2/10
(0.9992), indicating a higher evolutionary rate or sitespecific selective relaxation between them. An example
of the residues predicted to be functionally divergent
was mapped onto the topology models of the Group 7/9
members (Figure 6). The predicted functional sites are
not equally distributed throughout the OPT sequence,
but are distributed in different a-helices and b-strands.
The functions of these sites need to be experimentally
verified. Thus, the results of the functional divergence
analysis suggest that, because of the different evolutionary rates predicted at some amino acid sites, the OPT

genes may be significantly divergent from each other in
their functions. Perhaps, amino acid mutations have
spurred the OPT family genes to evolve new functions
after divergence and hence, functional divergence might
reflect the existence of long-term selective pressures.
Variable selective pressures among amino acid sites

positive selection and a ratio less than 1 suggests

purifying selection. The amino acids in a protein
sequence are expected to be under different selective
pressures and to have different underlying Ka/Ksratios.
To analyze positive or negative selection of specific
amino acid sites within the full-length sequences of the
OPT proteins in the different OPT groups, substitution
rate ratios of nonsynonymous (Ka) versus synonymous
(Ks) mutations were calculated with the Selecton Server
http://selecton.tau.ac.il using a Bayesian inference
approach [61]. The results show that the Ka/Ksratios of
the sequences from the different OPT groups are significantly different (Figure 7A). However, despite the differences in Ka/Ksvalues, all the estimated Ka/Ksvalues are
substantially lower than 1, suggesting that the OPT
sequences within each of the Groups are under strong
purifying selection pressure and that positive selection
may have acted only on a few sites during the evolutionary process. We performed the tests using the M8 (Ïs >
= 1), and M7 (beta) models. The selection model M7
does not indicate the presence of positively selected
sites, whereas the M8 model does (Figure 7A and 7B). It
is thus clear that, while most of the protein sequence is
subjected to constant purifying selection, a few sites
undergo positive selection. The detailed distribution of
the positive-selection sites in Group 4 sequences as predicted by the M8 model are showed in Figure 7C.
Further analyses indicate that six of the 10 positive
selection sites in the Group 4 sequences are in a-helices
(a1, a5 and a10). Interestingly, more than half of all the
predicted positive-selection sites (Figure 7B) are in the
b5 b-strand (2 sites) and in the a5 helix (4 sites). These
observations suggest that positive selection pressure on

the b-strands (b2, 4 and b5) and a-helices (a1, a5 and
a10) might have accelerated functional divergence and
the formation of the multiple subgroups. A few additional positively selected sites are distributed in other ahelices (a2-4 and a6-9), suggesting that these residues
might be important in maintaining the conformational
stability of the proteins.

Conclusion
This study provides a comparative genome analysis
addressing phylogeny, chromosomal location, gene
structure, expression profiling, functional divergence
and selective pressures of the OPT gene family in Populus and Vitis. Phylogenetic analyses revealed two wellsupported classes in the OPT family, each of which can
be further classified into 5 to 6 distinct groups. The
exon/intron structure and motif compositions of the
OPT genes and proteins are highly conserved in each
class and in each of the groups, indicative of their functional conservation. The OPTs genes are non-randomly
distributed across the Populus and Vitis chromosomes,
and a high proportion of the OPT genes may be derived
from tandem duplications. An additional comprehensive
analysis of the expression profiles has provided insights
into the possible functional divergence among members
of the OPT gene family. Furthermore, functional divergence analyses suggest that significant site-specific selective constraints may have acted on most OPT paralogs
after gene duplication, leading to subgroup-specific
functional evolution. These data may provide valuable
information for future functional investigations of this
gene family.

Methods
Sequence retrieval and identification

To identify potential members of the OPT gene family
in Populus and Vitis, we performed multiple database
searches. Published Arabidopsis and rice OPT gene
sequences [18,23] were retrieved and used as queries in
BLAST searches against the Poplar Genome database
http://genome.jgj-psf.org and the Genoscope Grape
Genome database http://www.cns.fr. BLAST searches
were also performed against the Poplar and Grape genomes at National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and Phytozome
http://www.phytozome.net.
WoLF PSORT http://wolfpsort.org[62] was used to
predict protein subcellular localization. The TMHMM
server http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/ was
used to estimate the number of transmembrane helical

domains. The isoelectric point (pI), molecular weight
and grand average hydropathy (GRAVY) values were
estimated using the ProtParam tool from ExPASy http://
us.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html.
Phylogenetic analyses of the OPT gene family

Multiple sequence alignments of the full-length protein
sequences were performed using MUSCLE 3.52 [63],
followed by manual comparisons and refinement. Gaps
and ambiguously aligned regions were removed before
phylogenetic analyses. ModelGenerator [64] was used to
determine the substitution model and rate heterogeneity
that best fit the OPT protein data. Phylogenetic analyses
were performed with a maximum likelihood method
using PhyML 3.0 [29] and a Bayesian inference method
using PhyloBayes 3 [30]. The LG model of protein
sequence substitution [65] and four gamma rate

Cao et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:465
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/465

categories, as determined by ModelGenerator, were used
for both maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses.
Bootstrap analyses for maximum likelihood analyses
were performed using 100 pseudoreplicates. For Bayesian analyses, two independent runs were carried out
with default settings until a maxdiff value = 0.27 was
achieved to ensure chain equilibration (4,300 generations). The first 100 points were discarded as burn-in,
and the posterior consensus was computed on the
remaining trees. The topology depicted in Figure 1 was
generated using PhyML.
Inference of duplication time

Pairwise alignment of nucleotide sequences of the OPT
paralogs was performed using MEGA 5 [66]. Alignments
were performed using ClustalW (codons). The Ka and
Ksvalues of the paralogous genes were estimated by the
program K-Estimator 6.0 [67]. To better explain the patterns of macroevolution, estimates of the evolutionary
rates were considered extremely useful. Assuming a
molecular clock, the synonymous substitution rates (Ks)
of the paralogous genes would be expected to be similar
over time. Thus, Kscould be used as the proxy for time
to estimate the dates of the segmental duplication
events. The Ks value was calculated for each of the gene
pairs and then used to calculate the approximate date of
the duplication event (T = Ks/2l), assuming clock-like
rates (l) of synonymous substitution of 1.5 Ã 10-8 substitutions/synonymous site/year for Arabidopsis [48], 6.5
Ã 10-9 for rice [68], 9.1 Ã 10-9 for Populus [69], and 6.5
Ã 10-9 for Vitis [70].
Chromosomal location and gene structure of the OPT
genes

The chromosomal locations of the OPT genes were
determined using the Populus genome browser http://
www.phytozome.net/poplar and Vitis genome browser
http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/spip/Vitis-vinifera-e.html.
Gene intron/extron structure information was collected
from the genome annotations of Populus and Vitis from
NCBI and Phytozome http://www.phytozome.net
databases.

The program MEME http://meme.sdsc.edu[53] was used
to identify motifs in the candidate Populus and Vitis
OPT protein sequences. MEME was run locally with the
following parameters: number of repetitions = any, maximum number of motifs = 30, and with optimum motif
widths constrained to between 6 and 200 residues.
Microarray analyses

The genome-wide microarray data of Populus published
by Dharmawardhana and coworkers [71] were obtained

Page 13 of 16

from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with
Accession Numbers GSE13043 and GSE21481. Probe
sets corresponding to the putative Populus OPTs were
identified on website http://genome.jgi-psf.org/. The
microarray data for Vitis reported by Lund and coworkers [72] and Fennell [73] were obtained from GEO
with Accession Numbers GSE11406 and GSE17502,
respectively. The Plant Expression Database (PLEXdb,
http://www.plexdb.org/index.php) [74] was also used for
expression analyses. For genes with more than one set
of probes, the median of expression values were used.
Finally, the expression data were gene-wise normalized
and hierarchically clustered based on Pearson coefficients with average linkage in the Genesis (version 1.7.6)
program [75].
Functional divergence analyses

To estimate the level of functional divergence and to
predict amino acid residues responsible for functional
differences in the OPT subfamilies, the coefficients of
type-I functional divergence were calculated using the
method suggested by Gu et al. [59,60]. The analyses
were carried out with DINERGE (version 2.0). The
method is based on maximum likelihood procedures to
estimate significant changes in the site-specific shift of
evolutionary rate or site-specific shift of amino acid
properties after the emergence of two paralogous
sequences. The advantage of this method is that it uses
amino acid sequences and, therefore, is not sensitive to
saturation of synonymous sites. Type-I functional divergence designates amino acid configurations that are
highly conserved in gene 1 but highly variable in gene 2,
or vice versa, implying that these residues have experienced altered functional constraints [59]. Coefficients of
functional divergence that are significantly greater than
0 indicate site-specific altered selective constraints or
radical shifts of amino acid physiochemical properties
after gene duplication. Site-specific posterior analysis
was used to predict amino acid residues that were crucial for functional divergence [45].
Positive selection assessment

Identification of site-specific positive and purifying
selection was calculated with the Selecton server
http://selecton.tau.ac.il/, which uses a Bayesian inference approach for the evolutionary models [61,76]. Ka/
Ksvalues are used to estimate the two types of substitutions events by calculating the synonymous rate (K s )
and the non-synonymous rate (Ka), at each codon site.
The server implements several evolutionary models
that describe in probabilistic terms how characters
evolve. In this study, two of the evolutionary models
(M8 and M7) were used. Each of the models uses different biological assumptions so that different

Cao et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:465
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/465

hypotheses can be tested and the model that best fits
the data can be selected. Briefly, M8 allows for positive
selection operating on the protein. A proportion p0 of
the sites are drawn from a beta distribution (defined in
the interval 0 [1]), and a proportion p1 (= 1-p0) of the
sites are drawn from an additional category Ïs (defined
to be â¥ 1). Thus, sites drawn from the beta distribution
are sites experiencing purifying selection, whereas sites
drawn from the Ï s category are sites experiencing
either neutral or positive selection. The M7 model is
similar to M8, except that it assumes only a beta distribution with no additional category. Thus, it allows
mainly for purifying selection in the protein. These
models all assume a statistical distribution to account
for heterogeneous Ka/Ksvalues among sites. The distributions are approximated using eight discrete categories and the K a /K s values are computed by
calculating the expectation of the posterior distribution
[61].
