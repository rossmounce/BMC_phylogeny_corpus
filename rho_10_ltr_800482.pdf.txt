Abstract
Background: Long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelements represent a successful group of transposable elements (TEs)
that have played an important role in shaping the structure of many eukaryotic genomes. Here, we present a genomewide analysis of LTR retroelements in Daphnia pulex, a cyclical parthenogen and the first crustacean for which the
whole genomic sequence is available. In addition, we analyze transcriptional data and perform transposon display
assays of lab-reared lineages and natural isolates to identify potential influences on TE mobility and differences in LTR
retroelements loads among individuals reproducing with and without sex.
Results: We conducted a comprehensive de novo search for LTR retroelements and identified 333 intact LTR
retroelements representing 142 families in the D. pulex genome. While nearly half of the identified LTR retroelements
belong to the gypsy group, we also found copia (95), BEL/Pao (66) and DIRS (19) retroelements. Phylogenetic analysis of
reverse transcriptase sequences showed that LTR retroelements in the D. pulex genome form many lineages distinct
from known families, suggesting that the majority are novel. Our investigation of transcriptional activity of LTR
retroelements using tiling array data obtained from three different experimental conditions found that 71 LTR
retroelements are actively transcribed. Transposon display assays of mutation-accumulation lines showed evidence for
putative somatic insertions for two DIRS retroelement families. Losses of presumably heterozygous insertions were
observed in lineages in which selfing occurred, but never in asexuals, highlighting the potential impact of reproductive
mode on TE abundance and distribution over time. The same two families were also assayed across natural isolates
(both cyclical parthenogens and obligate asexuals) and there were more retroelements in populations capable of
reproducing sexually for one of the two families assayed.
Conclusions: Given the importance of LTR retroelements activity in the evolution of other genomes, this
comprehensive survey provides insight into the potential impact of LTR retroelements on the genome of D. pulex, a
cyclically parthenogenetic microcrustacean that has served as an ecological model for over a century.
Background
Transposable elements (TEs) have been found in most
eukaryotic genomes and often constitute a significant
portion of the genome (e.g., 80% of maize [1], 45% of
human [2], and 5.3% of the fruit fly genome [3,4] are
known to be comprised of TEs). Because they can transpose from one location to another within the genome or
across genomes, the identification of TEs and analysis of
their dynamics are important for a better understanding
of the structure and evolution of both genomes and TEs
themselves [5,6]. Based on the mechanism of transposition, TEs are categorized into two major classes. The elements in class I (retroelements) are transposed through

reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate, whereas
the elements in class II (DNA transposons) are transposed through a cut-and-paste transposition mechanism
[6]. LTR retroelements, one type of class I retroelements,
are characterized by long terminal repeats (LTRs) at their
5' and 3' ends, and encode genes required for their retrotransposition (e.g., gag and pol). In several species, LTR
retroelements have amplified to high levels resulting in
major modifications of the host genome (e.g., in rice
[7,8])
In order to identify LTR retroelements in whole
genome sequences, many computational methods have
been developed [9]. De novo approaches search for putative pairs of LTRs in the genome [10,11]. The identified
LTRs can then be combined with other important
sequence features, including target site duplications
(TSDs) and conserved protein domains, to identify intact

LTR retroelements. Once the intact LTR retroelements
are found, homology-based searching (e.g., using RepeatMasker with a library of intact LTR retroelement
sequences) can be used to identify additional fragmented
elements and solo LTRs in the genome.
Although newly-sequenced genomes may contain
many TEs, it is often unclear what proportion of the identified elements remains active in the population. Recent
advances in tiling array technology provide opportunities
for measuring gene transcription levels at a genome-wide
scale, which can also be used to detect the activity of the
TEs that are identified in silico. Even though transcription
of TEs is not sufficient to cause their transposition, it is a
necessary first step for mobilization of retroelements. In
addition, recent work suggests transposable elements
may upregulate expression of host genes [12] or, more
generally, that TEs may function as part of genome-wide
regulatory networks [13]. Because transcription patterns
of TEs are known to vary under different environmental
conditions and/or at developmental stages, analysis of
transcription profiles is the first step towards understanding what factors might induce mobilization of TEs
in the host genome.
Transposon display can be used to compare differences
in TE load among individuals or populations over time or
from different regions. One of the features of the host
genomic environment that has been proposed to significantly impact TE mobility and distribution is the frequency of recombination [14,15]. Because D. pulex is a
cyclical parthenogen, it is possible to assess the role of
recombination in TE proliferation in this species without
many of the confounding variables that have plagued past
comparisons (e.g., species differences [16]). This is
because natural populations of D. pulex are known to lose
the ability to reproduce sexually (thereby becoming obligate asexuals) and sexual reproduction can be suppressed
or promoted by manipulating laboratory conditions.
Thus, it is possible to use this system to look more closely
at the short-and long-term impact of recombination on

TE abundance by combining laboratory and field comparisons.
The analysis of D. pulex presented in this paper represents the first such data for a freshwater aquatic arthropod and cyclical parthenogen and provides an
opportunity to better understand the dynamics of TEs via
comparison with other well-studied systems. LTR retroelements have been shown to exert a strong impact on
the genome of other organisms (see [17] for a recent
review) and may be capable of similar mobility and influence in this species as well.

Results
Identification of LTR retroelements in the Daphnia genome

Intact LTR retroelements were identified using multiple
empirical rules: similarity of a pair of LTRs at the both
ends, the structure of internal regions (IRs), di(tri)-nucleotides at flanking ends, and TSDs. The definition of
intact LTR retroelement was adapted from previous studies [3,18,19], and is limited to those that encode protein
domains such as gag and pol and have pairs of LTRs at
both ends. The intact elements identified were clustered
into families based on the sequence similarity of LTRs
between elements (> 80%). The program MGEScan-LTR
[11] identified 333 intact LTR retroelements in the D.
pulex genome and clustered them into 142 families (Table
1). The identified elements include 66 BEL, 95 copia, 19
DIRS, and 153 gypsy elements, which were clustered into
26, 44, 16, and 56 families, respectively (Table 1 and
Additional file 1 Table S1). Among these, 251 elements
have a pair of tri-nucleotides (TGT/ACA) flanking the
ends of the LTRs and TSDs ranging from 4 to 6 bp in
length.
In order to understand how the LTR retroelements in
the D. pulex genome are different from those in other
invertebrate genomes, we applied MGEScan-LTR [11] to
four additional genomes: Anopheles gambiae, Bombyx
mori, Drosophila melanogaster, and Oryza sativa.
Although these genomes have been analyzed in previous

studies [3,18,20,21], we searched for the intact LTR retroelements following the same procedure used for D. pulex
(Additional file 1 Table S2). The elements that we identified using our pipeline largely overlap with previously
described elements for each species. Small differences
might be due to the difference between the versions of
genomic sequences and/or the criteria used in these analyses.
Distribution of LTR retroelements in different groups

To date, gypsy is the most abundant among the four main
groups of LTR retroelements (gypsy, copia, BEL, and
DIRS) in invertebrate genomes such D. melanogaster, B.
mori, and A. gambiae [3,21]. In particular, the gypsy elements in the D. melanogaster genome belong to one of
three main lineages Gypsy, Mdg1, and Mdg3 [22], whereas
the elements in the A. gambiae genome belong to five distinctive lineages, including two additional lineages,
CsRN1 and Mag [23]. A total of 153 intact gypsy elements
from 56 families were identified in the D. pulex genome,
which corresponds to 46% of all intact LTR retroelements
identified in this study (Table 1). The phylogenetic analysis of the reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences from these
elements revealed that they consist of two major subgroups. One has high sequence similarity to the Mag lineage, but the other is distant from any known major
gypsy lineages (Figure 1). Among the 22 families in the
first subgroup, the neighbor-joining tree shows that the
family Dpul_G24 is close to the Mag element (bootstrap
value of 81), whereas Dpul_G35 and Dpul_G11 are close
to the SURL element (bootstrap value of 62). Notably, the
elements in Dpul_G24 family are closest to the Mag elements (BLAST E-value ~ 0.0) found in Chlamys farreri,
which contain only a single open reading frame (ORF)
encoding both gag and pol proteins.
Copia elements are known to be more abundant in
plant genomes than animal genomes (e.g., 37 out of 57
families in the O. sativa genome) [18]. Only a small number of copia elements have been identified in invertebrate
genomes [3,22,24], including the copia and 1731 families
in the D. melanogaster genome, and the Mosqcopia elements in the Aedes aegypti genome. Interestingly, our
results indicate that the copia group is highly abundant
and diverse in the D. pulex genome. A total of 95 intact
copia retroelements (clustered into 44 families) were
identified, which constitute 29% of all intact LTR retroelements identified in the D. pulex genome. The ratio of
the numbers of intact copia to gypsy elements is 0.62,
which is very high compared with other insect genomes
(0.11 for D. melanogaster and 0.13 for A. gambiae; Figure
2). The RT sequences from the D. pulex retroelements
and some representative elements from other genomes
(1731 and copia from D. melanogaster, RIRE1 and 11
additional LTR retroelements from O. sativa, Hopscotch

Page 3 of 11

from Zea mays, and Ty1 and Ty4 from Saccharomyces
cerevisiae) were used in the phylogenetic analysis. D.
pulex copia elements were roughly clustered into two
subgroups. One subgroup consists of four elements
(bootstrap value of 100), and the other subgroup consists
of the remaining elements (Figure 1).
The D. pulex genome has fewer BEL elements compared with other insect genomes for which data exist (D.
melanogaster and A. gambiae), which have more BEL elements than copia elements (Figure 2). A total of 66 intact
BEL retroelements were identified and clustered into 26
families, which correspond to 20% of all intact LTR retroelements found in this genome. The BEL/Pao retroelements are known to have four major lineages: Cer, Pao/
Ninja, Bel/Moose, and Suzu [25-29]. Six BEL families
identified in the D. pulex genome were close to the Cer
retroelements from C. elegans in the neighbor-joining
tree (bootstrap value of 87, Figure 1). The other 20 BEL
families in the D. pulex genome were close to the Pao/
Ninja lineage.
DIRS retroelements typically contain inverted repeats
instead of direct repeats, and are typically much shorter
than classic LTRs [30,31]. Hence, we modified MGEScanLTR program accordingly to search for proximal inverted
repeats and ORFs encoding proteins such as RT and
tyrosine recombinase (YR). A total of 19 intact DIRS retroelements (from 16 families) were identified in the D.
pulex genome, which correspond to 6% of all elements
identified in this genome. Given that no DIRS element
has been identified in any previously surveyed arthropod
genome except Tribolium castaneum [30], D. pulex has
the largest number of DIRS elements among the arthropods so far.
Transcriptional activity of LTR retroelements

The first step of the transposition of LTR retroelements is
transcription. The transcribed elements are then reverse
transcribed into DNA and inserted into the host genomes
by themselves or with help of other autonomous elements. However, all the transcribed elements are not necessarily transposed into host genomes. Therefore, the
analysis of transcriptional activity can help assess the
potential mobility of the LTR retroelements. We used
expression tiling array data sets from six separate experimental conditions for our analysis (Colbourne et al. manuscript in preparation). The transcriptome of adult
females was compared to that of adult males to assess
sex-based differences in LTR retroelement activity (Figure 3a and 3b). The transcriptome of mature stage-specific female animals exposed to metals was compared to
similar stage reference samples to assess human-induced
environmental stress conditions (Figure 3c and 3d).
Finally, the transcriptome of 4th instar juvenile females
exposed to predator kairomones from the dipteran larvae

a divergence scale are indicated. The families that have transcriptionally active elements are marked with black circles. The D. pulex elements identified

Transcriptionally-active regions (TARs) on the tiling
array were observed across the entire genome (data are

regions between the TARs and all 333 LTR retroelements
identified in this study to determine the transcription levels of the corresponding elements (Additional file 1 Table
S3 and S4). In total, 71 elements overlap with at least one
of the TARs, including 6 BEL, 23 copia, 2 DIRS, and 40

gypsy elements. A similar ratio of transcriptionally active
copia to gypsy elements (0.57) was observed relative to
the ratio of total number of copia to gypsy elements in the
whole genome sequence (0.62). Eleven families
(Dpul_C33, C7, C8, G1, G12, G28, G31, G32, G5, G56,
and G8) consisting of more than one element overlapped
with the TARs.
Among 71 elements with detectable transcriptional
activity, 12 elements show long TARs (> 500 bp), as listed
in Table 2. The element Dpul_C40 shows very long TARs
(85% of the element length) with high expression level
(log2 intensity of 5.37) in the adult female data set. Interestingly, the elements Dpul_C17 and Dpul_C28, both
show significant transcriptional activity (log2 intensity of
4.78 for both elements) and long TARs (1453 bp for

Page 5 of 11

Dpul_C17, and 1066 for Dpul_C28), but have relatively
low LTR similarities (92.5% and 92.7%, respectively). Pairwise alignment of their LTR pairs showed that the relatively low similarities were due to a short fragment (~20
bp) inserted in one of the LTR sequences. Therefore,
these elements might still represent a recent insertion,
and remain transcriptionally active in the natural D.
pulex population since low similarity is mainly caused by
the insert of single short fragment instead of several accumulated mutations.
Among the three experiments under different conditions, Dpul_G5 and Dpul_G7 showed transcriptional
activity across all six different conditions. On the other
hand, 20 elements were expressed in only one of the conditions. The expression pattern of these LTR retroelements is shown for each condition (Figure 3). The
elements showed higher overall transcriptional activity in
the dataset of adults, including female and male (Figure
3a and 3b) than in the other two data sets (mature stagespecific and 4th instar juvenile). In the kairomoneexposed condition, more elements were transcribed than
in the control set (Figures 3e and 3f).
Transposable element dynamics in lab-reared lines and
natural populations

In order to assess the role of reproductive mode in retroelement distribution and abundance among sexually-and
asexually-reproducing isolates, we developed a transposon display assay for two families of DIRS elements identified in the D. pulex genome. We chose DIRS elements
because they exhibited intact open-reading frames
(which are thought to be a prerequisite for potential
activity) and were low-copy number (perhaps making

We surveyed mutation-accumulation (MA) lines of D.
pulex to try and identify if there was any detectable activity and if patterns differed among lines where sex was
promoted or prohibited. In addition, we compared TE
loads for these two families of retroelements among natural populations in which sex occurs annually (cyclical parthenogens), and in which it does not occur (obligate
asexuals).
In mutation-accumulation lines, no germline gains
were detected in either retroelement family assayed in the
MA lines, but putative somatic gains occurred regularly
in both treatments (more often in sexuals than asexuals
for the Dpul_D16 family; Table 3). Rates of loss were
higher in sexuals than in asexuals in the family for which
any losses were observed (Dpul_D5; Table 3), but losses
were not randomly distributed across loci. Instead, they
occurred at a subset of the loci scored (4 of 7), presumably those that were heterozygous for the insertion at the
beginning of the experiment. The average number of
losses at these "high loss" loci was 10, which is very close
to the number that would be predicted simply based on
segregation of chromosomes and the probability of loss
for heterozygous insertions given the sample size of sexual lines surveyed here (11.5 predicted losses when n =
46).
In natural populations, the same two families of DIRS
retroelements were surveyed among isolates where sex
occurs at least yearly (cyclical parthenogens) and where
sex has been completely lost (obligate asexuals). Mean

copy number did not differ between cyclical parthenogens and obligate asexuals for Dpul_D16 but did for
Dpul_D5, with copy number in cyclicals exceeding that in
asexuals almost threefold (Table 4). In addition to higher
loads in sexuals, Dpul_D5 also exhibited higher insertion
site polymorphism among isolates from sexually-reproducing populations compared to obligate asexuals (with
26 polymorphic loci among cyclical parthenogens vs.
only 17 among obligate asexuals). Unlike the pattern
observed in DNA transposons (Schaack et al. accepted),
for the DIRS elements we observed a higher number of
singletons (loci occupied in only a single isolate) in cyclically-parthenogenetic isolates relative to obligate asexuals (for Dpul_D5 only; 17 versus 13).

Discussion
Composition of D. pulex LTR retroelements

In this study, we have identified 333 intact LTR retroelements in the D. pulex genome which were clustered into
142 families. With the library of intact elements identified, 3774 LTR retroelements were found by using
Repeatmasker. These retroelements constitute 7.9% of
the D. pulex genome, which is much higher than D. melanogaster (2.6% of 120 Mb genome) [3] and lower than that
found in B. mori (11.8% of 427 Mb genome) [21]. These
levels are all, however, much lower than those found in
plants which are known to typically have a much higher
proportion of LTR retroelements in their genomes (e.g.,
17% in O. sativa [18]). In addition to quantifying the LTR
retroelement content, our survey showed that the families of LTR retroelements in D. pulex are more divergent

than previous whole genome analyses have shown. For
example, while only 26 copia elements were identified in
D. melanogaster [3], in D. pulex there are 95 families
(Additional file 1 Table S1; Figure 2). In all invertebrate
genomes surveyed in this study, the number of copia families are very low (Additional file 1 Table S2), which is also
consistent with previous studies [3,21]. Our study also
confirmed the presence of 19 DIRS elements in the D.
pulex genome, which is much higher than any other
invertebrate genomes sequenced so far. Only a few DIRS
elements have been found in T. castaneum [30], Dictyostelium discoideum, and some fish (e.g., Danio rerio [31]),
but none have been identified in the model organisms D.
melanogaster, A. gambiae, and O. sativa.
Survey of transcriptional activities in LTR retroelements

Since transcription of the LTR retroelements is the first
step required for their transposition, genome-wide
screening of transcriptional data was used to determine
what proportion of the LTR retroelements might be
active. Tiling arrays use unbiased probes, in contrast to
cDNA microarrays which are designed to target gene
expression alone, thus providing a general picture of
expression patterns under various conditions. Overall,
the transcription of more than 20% (71 out of 333) of the

intact LTR retroelements was detected in the D. pulex
genome. For the purpose of comparison, we retrieved the
expression pattern for 136 intact non-LTR retroelements
that were identified in the D. pulex genome [32], and
found that only eight (~5%) elements showed transcriptional activity and one of them had significantly long
TARs (1138 bp). Additionally, we collected tiling array
data for D. melanogaster at different developmental
stages from the ENCODE website (Additional file 1 Table
S5) and matched the TARs with the annotated LTR retroelements. In total, 25 (out of 412) intact elements from 12
families match with TARs, including 3 BEL, 1 copia, and
21 gypsy elements. Four elements from roo and rover families that have been shown to transpose previously
[33,34], also showed transcriptional activity here (TAR
length > 500 bp). The LTR retroelements in D. pulex
exhibit higher transcriptional activity (in terms of the
number and diversity of the elements) than those in D.
melanogaster, even though there are fewer intact LTR retroelements identified in the D. pulex genome than those
in the D. melanogaster genome.
Several elements in plant genomes are known to be able
to transpose under specific conditions (e.g., high temperature [35,36]). Our study shows that the kairomoneexposed Daphnia show higher TE transcription levels

than controls. Notably, under the same condition, the
protein-coding genes of Daphnia also showed an overall
higher transcription level, implying that global transcription activity is induced under the kairomone-exposed
condition. On the other hand, the transcription level of
LTR retroelements is not significantly different in the
experiments comparing female vs. male and metal exposure. Although our analysis shows general trends in transcriptional activity, further experiments are required to
investigate the activity of individual LTR retroelement
families.
TEs as components of the dynamic genome

Although no germline gains were observed in the mutation-accumulation lines, evidence for putative somatic
gains was observed in both DIRS families assayed, providing additional evidence that there may be active retroelements in the D. pulex genome. The higher rate of
putative somatic gains observed in lines in which sex
occurred for the Dpul_D15 family is the opposite of the
trend observed in DNA transposon families (Schaack et
al. accepted). In addition to gains, lineages undergoing sex
exhibited frequent losses for one family assayed, presumably because this family included heterozygotic copies
(presence-absence) at the beginning of the experiment,
which subsequently were lost 25% of the time via independent assortment of chromosomes during sex (which
in this case was selfing). This difference highlights the
importance of reproductive mode for the accumulation of
mutation loads in the genome. Sexually-reproducing
organisms can purge deleterious mutations (such as TE
insertions) during recombination. Asexuals cannot purge
TE insertions (other than via mitotic recombination at
heterozygotic loci). As asexuals accumulate new mutations over time (Muller's ratchet [37]), it is thought that
their fitness will decline and eventually they will go
extinct [38].
Although the results of the transposon display assay
support the idea that TEs may build up in asexual lineages over time, the data from the natural isolates indicate that, in nature, sexual isolates build up higher TE
loads than asexuals, at least in one of the two families
assayed (Dpul_D5). This result corroborates previous
studies in D. pulex on the DNA transposon Pokey assayed
among natural populations [39,40]. The increased number of TEs in sexuals could be explained in a number of
ways. First, despite the increased efficiency of selection in
sexual lineages, sex is a good way for new TE copies to
spread among lineages in a population (whereas a new
insertion in an asexual lineage is, effectively, at a genetic
dead end). It is also possible that TE copies in recombining genomic backgrounds are able to better evade host
suppression mechanisms because there is a higher chance
of meiotic recombination among TE copies and therefore

Page 8 of 11

the production of novel genotypes undetectable by coevolved suppression mechanisms. Alternatively, recombination events among retroelements belonging to the
same family may render individual copies inactive, leading to a build-up over time of inactive copies in sexual lineages which is less likely in asexuals. Lastly, obligate
asexuals that are able to persist in nature may represent
isolates that evolved from especially low load sexual lineages, thereby minimizing the so-called "lethal hangover"
from their sexual ancestors [41].

Conclusions
We have performed a genome-wide analysis of the LTR
retroelement content of the D. pulex genome, the first
aquatic microcrustacean and cyclical parthenogen for
which such an analysis has been performed. We identified 333 intact LTR retroelements in the D. pulex
genome, and categorized them into BEL/Pao, copia,
DIRS, and gypsy groups, respectively. As with other
insects such as D. melanogaster and A. gambiae, the
major group of retroelements in the Daphnia genome is
gypsy, which includes almost half of the intact retroelements identified in this study. Notably, a very significant
number of intact copia retroelements were identified as
well. In addition, the D. pulex genome has been found to
house the most DIRS elements among the arthropod
genomes sequenced to date.
Transcriptional activity of intact LTR retroelements
was surveyed by using tiling array data across the whole
genome sequence. A total of 71 LTR retroelements
showed expression signals, among which 12 elements
contain long TAR regions. Transposon display assays of
two intact DIRS retroelements were also performed and
provide evidence for possible activity in mutation-accumulation lines of D. pulex. Patterns of TE load and polymorphism in natural populations indicate sexuallyreproducing isolates have heavier TE loads and higher
insertion site polymorphism among isolates for one family. Consistent with previously identified DIRS elements
in fish and other animals, the Daphnia DIRS elements
assayed here exhibit different structures of IR and protein
domains (e.g., the YRs), compared with the elements
from the other three groups. Further investigation of
population-level differences for other families identified
in this survey will help pinpoint which families of LTR
retroelements remain active in the D. pulex genome and
the extent to which they may influence genome evolution
in this species.

Identification of intact LTR retroelements

We applied an automatic computational tool [11] to find
intact LTR retroelements in the whole genome sequences
listed above. The method in this study was improved to
locate the TSDs and flanking ends of LTRs. Since it is not
necessary for all intact LTR retroelements to have these
features, we modified the program to be flexible by making this information optional. For example, although the
majority of LTR flanking regions are di-nucleotides TG/
CA, the well-known family DM297 in the D. melanogaster genome has di-nucleotides AG/CT. In the next
step, the identified LTR retroelements were clustered into
families based on the sequence similarity of LTRs
between elements (sequence similarity > 80% for clustering elements in a family). Finally, the classified families
were verified by using multiple sequence alignment of
LTRs and IRs.
The element name consists of four parts: genome
name, family name, scaffold name (release 1 from wfleaBase), and the ID in each scaffold. For example, the element Dpul_G2_147_2 corresponds to the second element
in scaffold 147, which is in the family G2 (G for gypsy elements, C for copia elements, B for BEL element, and D
for DIRS element) in the D. pulex genome.
Phylogenetic analysis

For phylogenetic analysis, representative RT sequences
were obtained from NCBI (see Materials and Methods

Page 9 of 11

section and Additional file 1 Table S6). Multiple sequence
alignments of RT amino acid sequences were performed
with default parameters by using CLUSTALW [42]. Phylogenetic trees were generated by using neighbor-joining
tree method with poisson correction and 1000 bootstrap
replicates in MEGA [43].
Identification of LTR retroelement activity in mutationaccumulation lines

Mutation-accumulation lines were initiated in August
2004, from offspring originating from a single individual
of D. pulex (Log50) originally collected from western
Oregon. Log50 is the same isolate that was used for the
genome sequencing project, and is from a relatively
highly inbred, homozygous population. Lines were propagated by single-progeny each generation soon after their
first clutch (~12 days at 20Â°C). Asexual lines were propagated by transferring either one or five (alternating each
generation) random 1- to 2-day-old live female offspring
to a new beaker. Crowding was used to generate cues
inducing meiosis and when females produced males,
selfed, and released resting eggs (ephippia), the eggs were
collected and stored in tissue culture plates with 5-10 ml
H20 per well at 4Â°C. Resting eggs were typically produced
4-5 days after asexually-produced young had been born
and transferred to a new beaker to propagate the original
asexual line. Any ephippia that hatched after exposing
eggs to short, intermittent periods of warmer temperatures (20Â°C) were used to initiate sexual sublines of asexual lineages. Sexual sublines (identified by their source
asexual lineage and the generation at which the bout of
sexual reproduction had occurred) were occasionally
induced to reproduce sexually a second time, although
only three such lineages were included in this survey.
Other than hatching (and the conditions immediately
preceding hatching), sexual sublines were maintained in
the same manner over the course of the experiment as
asexuals and treatments differ only by the occurrence of
at least one (and occasionally two) bouts of sex. LTR retroelement activity was assayed in a subset of the mutation-accumulation lines (n = 93) after approximately 45
generations of single individual bottlenecks using transposon display. Transposon display (TD; [44]) was performed by using ECOR1 to digest genomic DNA
extracted from 5-10 individuals from each lineage using
CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) extraction
protocols adapted for D. pulex [45]. Digests were performed for 6 hrs at 37Â°C followed by 22 min at 80Â°C.
Adaptors consisting of ~50 bp oligonucleotide pairs with
a non-complementary mid-portion were ligated on to the
ends of each fragment after the digest (16 hr ligation
using T4 ligase at room temperature). Element-containing fragments are amplified via nested PCR using an element-specific primer (forward) and a reverse primer

complementary to the non-complementary mid-portion
of the ligated adaptors (Table 5). Only fragments of the
genome containing copies of a given element amplify
during PCR because the reverse primer cannot anneal
unless the element-specific primer binds and elongates.
This technique is sensitive but provides a lower-bound
estimate for activity levels because long fragments may
not amplify due to PCR bias. Conditions for the first and
second round of PCR were as follows: initial denaturation
at 94Â°C for 3 min, followed by 24 cycles of denaturation at
94Â°C for 30 sec, annealing at 5Â°C below the melting temperature for the element-specific primer, and elongation
at 72Â°C for 1 min, and ending with a 5 min elongation
step at 72Â°C. The second round of PCR used an elementspecific primer slightly more towards the 3' end of the
conserved region of the element. Since all lines were initiated from a single common ancestor, differences in banding pattern among descendent lineages indicate loss and/
or gain of copies of individual elements within the
genome. Peaks were scored as present if observed in multiple replicates (all assays were performed three times
from the same ligated sample of DNA) and peaks that
were above thresholds for inclusion but not observed in
multiple replicates were scored as putative somatic insertions. The reason a non-replicable peak that was above
threshold is considered a putative somatic insertion is
because, given the DNA was extracted from 5-10 individuals, if an insertion occurred in somatic tissue, it would
not be universally present in all three replicates. With
only three replicates, this method most likely underestimates the frequency of somatic insertions, but can be
used to detect a difference among treatments.
