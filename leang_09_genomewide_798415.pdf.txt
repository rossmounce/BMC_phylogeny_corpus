Abstract
Background: The role of the RNA polymerase sigma factor RpoN in regulation of gene expression in
Geobacter sulfurreducens was investigated to better understand transcriptional regulatory networks as part
of an effort to develop regulatory modules for genome-scale in silico models, which can predict the
physiological responses of Geobacter species during groundwater bioremediation or electricity production.
Results: An rpoN deletion mutant could not be obtained under all conditions tested. In order to
investigate the regulon of the G. sulfurreducens RpoN, an RpoN over-expression strain was made in which
an extra copy of the rpoN gene was under the control of a taclac promoter. Combining both the
microarray transcriptome analysis and the computational prediction revealed that the G. sulfurreducens
RpoN controls genes involved in a wide range of cellular functions. Most importantly, RpoN controls the
expression of the dcuB gene encoding the fumarate/succinate exchanger, which is essential for cell growth
with fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor in G. sulfurreducens. RpoN also controls genes, which
encode enzymes for both pathways of ammonia assimilation that is predicted to be essential under all
growth conditions in G. sulfurreducens. Other genes that were identified as part of the RpoN regulon using
either the computational prediction or the microarray transcriptome analysis included genes involved in
flagella biosynthesis, pili biosynthesis and genes involved in central metabolism enzymes and cytochromes
involved in extracellular electron transfer to Fe(III), which are known to be important for growth in
subsurface environment or electricity production in microbial fuel cells. The consensus sequence for the
predicted RpoN-regulated promoter elements is TTGGCACGGTTTTTGCT.
Conclusion: The G. sulfurreducens RpoN is an essential sigma factor and a global regulator involved in a
complex transcriptional network controlling a variety of cellular processes.

Background
RpoN (σ54 or sigma 54) is a subunit of the RNA polymerase and plays a critical role in the regulation of gene
expression by recognizing specific promoter elements and
initiating transcription. RpoN-dependent promoters do
not have conserved -35 and -10 elements typically found
in the promoters recognized by sigma factors in the σ70
family. Instead, a GG dinucleotide around position -24
and a GC dinucleotide around position -12 with respect to
the transcription initiation site are highly conserved
among RpoN-dependent promoters [1]. The consensus of
186 RpoN-dependent promoter elements from 47 bacterial
species
was
reported
to
be
mrNrYTGGCACG...4bp...TTGCWNNw [2]. In contrast to σ70
family sigma factors, RpoN is able to bind to a promoter
without the core RNA polymerase (RNAP) [1]. RNAP containing RpoN (RNAP/RpoN) can form a stable closed
complex with the promoter. In addition, RNAP/RpoN
requires a transcription factor, the enhancer-binding protein (EBP), for initiation of transcription. Some of the EBP
family members are response regulators in two-component regulatory systems [3]. RpoN was first identified in
Escherichia coli and was reported to regulate the transcription initiation of nitrogen assimilation genes [4]. Since
then, RpoN homologs have been identified in bacteria
from different phylogenetic origins and are involved in
regulation of genes related to a diverse functional categories [5], including genes for pili and flagella biosynthesis
and quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa [6-8], C4dicarboxylate transport in Mesorhizobium ciceri [9] and carbon metabolism in Gram positive bacteria, Bacillus subtilis
and Listeria monocytogenes [10-13].
Geobacter species are important agents in the bioremediation of subsurface environments contaminated with
organic or metal contaminants [14]. They also appear to
be the primary contributors to current production in
microbial fuel cells harvesting electricity from the environment [15]. Some physiological responses of Geobacter
species can be predicted with constraint-based genomescale metabolic models that determine the optimal flux of
metabolites for a given environmental condition [16]. The
ability to predictively model the physiological responses
of environmentally relevant microorganisms to a wide
diversity of environmental conditions is a major goal of
environmental biotechnology [14,17]. However, the current version of these models lacks regulatory modules that
could increase their predictive value. Progress has been
made using a combination of bioinformatic tools and
molecular biological methods to identify regulatory components, such as operon structures, promoter elements,
and transcription factors and their binding sites, as well as
global transcriptomic and proteomic expression patterns
that provide the basis for building regulatory modules in
G. sulfurreducens [18-21]. Sigma factors are key to con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/331

structing bacterial transcriptional regulatory networks. In
G. sulfurreducens, homologs of RpoD, RpoS, RpoH, RpoE
and FliA of the σ70 family have been identified and physiological roles of G. sulfurreducens RpoS [22,23], RpoH [24]
and RpoE (G. Reguera et al, unpublished) have been elucidated.
An ortholog of the rpoN gene (GSU1887) is present in the
G. sulfurreducens genome [19]. It encodes a protein, which
shares a considerable degree of similarity to RpoN sigma
factors from other bacteria. We report here that an rpoN
deletion mutant could not be isolated under conditions
tested in this study. In order to identify the components of
the RpoN regulon in G. sulfurreducens, genome-wide
microarray transcriptional profiling of an RpoN overexpression strain and genome-wide prediction of RpoNregulated promoters were employed. We discuss below
our findings that RpoN-dependent genes carry out important functions that may contribute to the reasons why no
viable rpoN deletion mutants could be obtained.

Results
The Geobacter sulfurreducens rpoN gene cluster
An rpoN ortholog (GSU1887), which encodes the RpoN
sigma factor, is present in the G. sulfurreducens genome.
Phylogenetic analysis showed that G. sulfurreducens RpoN
is very similar to other experimentally characterized RpoN
sigma factors, such as the Escherichia coli RpoN [19]. The
G. sulfurreducens RpoN polypeptide displays characteristic
structures of the members of the RpoN family, including
an N-terminal glutamine-rich region (the first 50 amino
acids), a C-terminal X-link, a helix-turn-helix (HTH)
DNA-binding motif, and an RpoN box (ARRTVTKYRE)
[25].

Analysis of the chromosomal region surrounding the G.
sulfurreducens rpoN gene revealed that its downstream
genes encode a homolog of a ribosomal subunit interface
protein (GSU1886) whose N-terminal domain is homologous to the RpoN modulation protein found in Klebsiella
pneumoniae [26] and a homolog of Hpr (Ser) kinase/phosphorylase (GSU1885). The upstream genes encode an
ATP binding protein (GSU1888) and two conserved proteins (GSU1889 and GSU1890) with unknown function
(Figure 1a).
In order to understand the physiological role of RpoN and
of genes it controls in G. sulfurreducens, construction of a
deletion mutant of the rpoN gene was attempted. However, an rpoN mutant could not be isolated under different
growth conditions using media with different electron
acceptors (fumarate or Fe(III) citrate) and amendments
(glutamine or glutamate) (Table 1). Different mutagenesis strategies were attempted, including deletion of the
whole coding region of the rpoN gene, only the 5'-end of

the rpoN coding region, or only the 3'-end of the rpoN coding region (Figure 1b). No viable mutants were derived
from above attempts. We also constructed an rpoN diploid
strain (DLCN43) in which an extra copy of the rpoN gene
was integrated into the chromosome and controlled by
the promoter from a chloramphenicol resistance cassette
(Figure 1c). Attempts of deleting and replacing the original rpoN gene from DLCN43 also failed. Furthermore, an
extra copy of the rpoN gene under the control of a constitutively active lac promoter, or under the control of an
IPTG (isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside)-inducible taclac
promoter was introduced to the wild type strain in trans
(Figure 1d). Attempts of deleting the chromosomal rpoN
gene yielded viable isolates. However, further analysis of
these isolates indicated that none of them had deletion of
the chromosomal rpoN gene. In contrast, insertion of a
kanamycin resistance cassette at the intergenic regions
immediately upstream or downstream of the rpoN gene
yielded viable mutants, suggesting that the inability to isolate an rpoN-deletion mutant was not due to the polar
effects of the kanamycin resistance cassette. The conditions and mutagenesis methods used in this work for our

attempts to isolate a null rpoN mutant are summarized in
Table 1, and mutation scheme is illustrated in Figure 1.
RpoN expression patterns and over-expression of RpoN
In order to understand RpoN expression under different
growth conditions, Western blot analysis was performed
using anti-sera against RpoN with cell extracts prepared
from cultures grown with a variety of electron donors/
acceptors. RpoN levels were similar in cultures grown in
the presence of ammonium or when nitrogen fixation was
required in ammonia-free medium, and RpoN was constitutively expressed under all other conditions tested (Figure 2a).

Because an rpoN deletion mutant could not be obtained,
a strain in which the rpoN gene was over-expressed under
the control of the IPTG-inducible taclac promoter was
generated to gain insights into the function of RpoN. The
strain capable of over-expressing RpoN (DL1/pCDrpoN)
and the control strain harboring the empty vector
pCD341 (DL1/pCD341) were designated RpoN+ and
WTV, respectively, for simplification. The over-expression
of the RpoN protein in RpoN+ after induction was con-

Two biological samples were shown for IPTG-induced WTV
and RpoN+ strains. IPTG was added at final concentration 1
mM.

firmed using Western blot analysis (Figure 2b). The abundance of the RpoN protein in the RpoN+ strain was 5.4
times more than that of the wild type with IPTG induction, but it stayed at a similar level as that of the wild type
in the absence of IPTG. The WTV strain, with or without
the addition of IPTG, had levels of RpoN similar to those
in the wild type strain.
When induced with IPTG, the RpoN+ strain grew slower
and had a longer lag phase than the WTV strain with either
fumarate or Fe(III) citrate as the electron acceptor and acetate as the electron donor (Figure 3a, c &3d). The effect of
over-expressing RpoN on growth was more pronounced
when cells were grown in media lacking ammonia (Figure
3b). The doubling times for the WTV and the RpoN+
strains were 7.5 and 9.7 hours, respectively, in the presence of IPTG in the NBAF medium (Figure 3a). Under
nitrogen fixation conditions, the doubling times for the
WTV and the RpoN+ strains were 12.5 and 51.3 hours,
respectively, in the presence of IPTG in the ammoniumfree NBAF medium (Figure 3b). For FWAFC media, the
doubling times were 9.6 and 14.9 hours with IPTG for
WTV and RpoN+, respectively (Figure 3d). The RpoN+
strain grew similarly with the WTV strain in the absence of
IPTG in all media. These results suggest that over-expression of RpoN inhibited growth under various conditions.

The RpoN regulon identified by genome-scale
transcriptome analysis and prediction of RpoN-dependent
promoters
To elucidate the function of RpoN in Geobacter species, the
transcriptome of the RpoN+ and the WTV strains was compared in order to identify those genes whose transcription
is regulated by RpoN. Due to different growth rates
between the two strains in the NBAF medium (Figure 3),
total RNA was isolated independently from three sets of
WTV and RpoN+ cultures during the exponential growth
phase, about OD600 = 0.3–0.35 and 0.2–0.25 for the WTV
and RpoN+ strains, respectively.

With a 1.5 fold-change cutoff and a relatively strong cutoff
for false discovery rate (FDR) of p < 0.0005, the RpoN+
strain was found to have 138 genes with increased transcript levels and 59 genes with decreased transcript levels
when compared to the WTV strain. The fold change of the
transcription level of the rpoN gene itself was 6.61 higher
in the RpoN+ strain than in the WTV strain, which is in
agreement with protein over-expression results obtained
by the Western blot analysis. A complete list of the differentially expressed genes and their expression ratio is provided as additional files (see Additional files 1 &2). The
196 genes with significant changes in expression level in
the RpoN+ strain were assigned to 16 functional groups.
Most of them encoded hypothetical proteins or proteins
with unknown function (63 genes). The top three categories of genes with annotated functions consisted of genes
associated with protein synthesis (33), energy metabolism (21 genes), and transport and binding (12).
In addition to observing the RpoN regulon by using gene
expression microarrays, we employed computational
analysis using the PromScan software [27] to identify
RpoN recognition sequence elements within the G. sulfurreducens genome. The search identified 798 putative
RpoN recognition sequence elements with scores ≥ 80
(data not shown). Among these sequence elements, 467
elements were located upstream of protein-coding genes,
in the same strand orientation as their potential target
genes. Of these possible promoter elements that could
potentially regulate transcription of protein-coding genes,
110 were located in noncoding regions. We considered
these 110 sequence elements to be the most likely RpoNregulated promoters. Their sequences and genome locations are provided in Additional file 3, while their predicted target genes and operons are provided in
Additional file 4. The consensus sequence of these 110
predicted G. sulfurreducens RpoN-regulated promoter elements listed in Additional file 3 was TTGGCACGGTTTTTGCT, where the -24 GG and the -12 GC dinucleotides are
in bold. The highest scoring RpoN-regulated promoter
was located upstream of the flagella biosynthesis operon

containing the fliA gene encoding the RNA polymerase
sigma factor FliA (σ28) (see Additional file 4).
Genome locations of the 110 RpoN-dependent sequence
elements identified using the PromScan analysis were
cross-examined with the list of genes identified by the
transcriptome analysis with a fold change cutoff of 1.25.
The results of this comparison are listed in Additional file
5, and selected operons encoding genes related to nitrogen assimilation, appendages and solute transport are
listed in Table 2. These combined data showed that RpoN
regulatory elements can be found in not only up-regulated
genes, but also down-regulated genes. The increased transcript levels observed for some genes could result from
increased RpoN availability for transcription initiation
that is the limiting factor at a normal rpoN transcript level.
The decreased transcript levels for some genes could be
due to the fact that RpoN alone can bind to the -24/-12
elements without the core RNAP, and therefore the promoter regions may not be accessible by other sigma factors, or less core RNAP may be available in the excess of
RpoN [1,28].
Both microarray transcriptome analysis and computational prediction of RpoN promoter elements concluded
that the dcuB gene, which encodes the fumarate/succinate
exchanger (C4-dicarboxylate transporter), is RpoNdependent. Both analyses also indicated that genes encoding components for nitrogen assimilation, such as
glutamine synthetase (GS) (GSU1835), are RpoNdependent (Table 2). Furthermore, our computational
analysis identified an RpoN promoter upstream of the
glutamate synthetase (GSU1239, GOGAT) operon. The
microarray analysis indicated that the gene encoding
glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) (GSU1305) is RpoNdependent.
In silico modeling analysis was utilized to understand the
role of GDH, GS and GOGAT enzymes in G. sulfurreducens
metabolism. The growth of G. sulfurreducens was simulated under different growth conditions, varying electron
donors, electron acceptors, and nitrogen sources. In silico
modeling analysis suggested that missing both GS and
GOGAT enzymes or GDH, GS and GOGAT is lethal under
all growth conditions.
Other genes identified by both the transcriptome analysis
and the computational promoter prediction include those
encoding flagella biosynthesis, formate dehydrogenase,
alcohol dehydrogenase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase
(Table 2 and Additional file 5).
An RpoN-dependent regulatory element, located
upstream of the pilA gene encoding pilin, the building
block for nanowires [29], was identified by the PromScan

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/331

software in this study and by 5'-RACE analysis in an earlier
study [30]. Therefore, the effect of RpoN-overexpression
was tested on the pili formation via a cell agglutination
assay at 25°C [31]. In the presence of IPTG, the RpoN+
strain displayed less agglutination at 25°C than WTV and
WT (Figure 3e), which strongly suggests that RpoN is
involved in pili biogenesis.
Genes that were differentially expressed in the RpoN+
strain but for which no RpoN-dependent regulatory elements could be found include those encoding components of stress response/molecular chaperones, central
metabolism, extracellular electron transfer, and genes
encoding regulatory proteins (see Additional files 1 &2),
suggesting their possible indirect regulation by RpoN or a
possibility that their RpoN promoters may be too divergent from promoters in other bacteria to be detected using
computational approaches. Alternatively, the physiological states caused by the overexpression of RpoN in the
RpoN+ strain, which were different from those in the WTV
strain, such as slower growth, might affect gene regulation.
Evaluation of predicted RpoN-dependent promoters via
primer extension analysis
In order to further validate the results of the microarray
transcriptome analysis and of the computational promoter prediction and to examine promoters regulating
differentially expressed genes, primer extension assays
were carried out on 12 selected operons or singleton
genes, including seven genes with increased expression
and five genes with decreased expression in the microarray analysis (Table 3). These selections included 1) genes
involved in cellular functions that were reported in other
bacteria to be RpoN-dependent, such as flagella biosynthesis and nitrogen assimilation; or 2) genes involved in
physiological functions that were not previously reported
to be RpoN-dependent in other bacteria, but were predicted to have conserved RpoN-dependent -24/-12 promoter elements in their regulatory regions, or 3) genes
encoding enzymes that are essential for cell growth. The
trend of changes in transcript levels observed in the
primer extension assays was similar to that reported in the
microarray analysis (Figure 4, Table 3 and Additional file
6), with an exception of GSU1836 (glnB), which encodes
a PII nitrogen regulatory protein.

Eight genes out of the 12 selected genes had promoter elements identified by the primer extension assays to match
those identified by the computational predictions, and six
of these eight genes were found to be regulated by promoter sequences highly similar to other bacterial RpoN
promoter elements (Table 3). These six RpoN-regulated
genes were GSU0420 (fliL), GSU1836 (glnB), GSU2806
(nifEN), GSU3046 (flgJ), GSU2751 (dcuB) and GSU0777

(fdnG) (Figure 4 &5 and Table 3). Alignment of these six
G. sulfurreducens RpoN promoter elements and of the promoter element upstream of the pilA gene identified in the
previous study [30] was shown (Figure 5).
While conserved RpoN-regulated promoters were predicted for other four genes/operons (GSU0939,
GSU2005, GSU2490 and GSU3206) by the computational tools (see Additional file 4), no -24/-12 RpoNdependent promoter elements could be identified by
primer extension assays for these genes/operons (see
Additional file 6). It is possible that the predicted RpoNregulated promoter elements for these four genes/operons
are activated only under certain conditions, such as nitrogen-fixing conditions, which were different from the conditions for the primer extension assays.
In conclusion, the primer extension analyses showed that
RpoN-regulated promoters are located upstream of genes
for a fumarate/succinate exchanger (GSU2751, dcuB),
glutamine synthetase (GSU1836-1835 operon, glnBglnA), flagella biosynthesis proteins (GSU0420–0426,
and GSU3040–3046), nitrogen assimilation enzymes
(GSU2802–2806), and a formate dehydrogenase
(GSU0777–0781). In addition, an RpoN-regulated pro-

moter was also identified for the pilA gene (GSU1496) by
5'-RACE analysis [30].

Discussion
The G. sulfurreducens RpoN regulon
The G. sulfurreducens RpoN regulon was identified using
the microarray transcriptome analysis combined with the
computational analysis. Both methods indicated that
RpoN plays an important role in influencing the expression of a number of genes that are important for growth
in subsurface environment and in microbial fuel cells.
Most evidently, both methods demonstrated that the G.
sulfurreducens RpoN controls the expression of a fumarate/
succinate exchanger (DcuB), which is essential under
fumarate respiration [32]. Thus, no viable rpoN deletion
mutant was isolated when fumarate was the terminal electron acceptor. This is the first report to our knowledge
identifying a -24/-12 RpoN-dependent promoter element
in the dcuB regulatory region. In other bacteria, such as E.
coli, the dcuB gene is transcribed by RNA polymerase in
complex with the RpoD sigma factor, and its expression is
under a hierarchical control involving FNR, CRP, and a
two-component regulatory system [33].

Glutamate and glutamine, the essential biomass components and major intracellular nitrogen donors, are the
products of ammonia assimilation and are synthesized in
bacteria via two pathways [34]. The G. sulfurreducens
RpoN controls the expression of enzymes involved in
both pathways for ammonia assimilation, namely, 1) the
GDH-dependent pathway, in which glutamate is synthesized by reductive amination of 2-ketoglutarate and 2) the
GS-GOGAT pathway, in which GS converts glutamate and
ammonia to glutamine and GOGAT transfers the amide
group from glutamine to 2-ketoglutarate. Therefore, deleting the rpoN gene would result in deficiencies in ammonia
assimilation and thus, cell death. In E. coli, the GSGOGAT pathway is used under energy-rich and nitrogenlimiting conditions and the expression of both enzymes is
under the control of RpoN, whereas the GDH pathway is
employed under energy-limiting and excess ammonium
conditions, and the transcription of GDH is controlled by
RNAP/RpoD [34-36]. In fact, the expression of other
known bacterial GDHs is controlled by RNAP/RpoD,
including those in Neisseria meningitides, Klebsiella aero-

genes, Psychrobacter sp, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [37-42].
Acetate is a primary electron donor for Geobacter species in
soils and sediments [43], especially during groundwater
uranium bioremediation [44]. The microarray study suggests that RpoN positively regulates the expression of
genes essential for acetate oxidation coupled to metal
reduction such as fumarase (GSU0994) and acetyl-CoA
transferases (GSU0174 and GSU0490) [45]. The inability
to isolate an rpoN null mutant could also be due to the
poor expression of these essential TCA cycle enzymes in
the absence of RpoN. The ability to recover such a mutant
with Fe(III) as the electron acceptor would also be limited
due to low expression of the cytochromes essential for
Fe(III) reduction, such as the omcB gene [46], which was
up-regulated in the RpoN+ strain (see Additional file 1).
Flagella are considered to play an important role in Fe(III)
oxide reduction by Geobacter species [47]. The regulatory
regions from both operons containing GSU0420 and
GSU3046 encoding flagella proteins contain sequences

Page 11 of 19

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:331

homologous to RpoN-dependent promoter sequences
(Figure 4 and 5). As presented in Table 2 and Additional
file 4, the operon containing the fliA gene (σ28, GSU3053)
along with other flagella biosynthesis genes (flg-1, flg-2,
flh-A, and others) was predicted to have the highest scoring RpoN-regulated promoter, indicating that this promoter was highly conserved and that σ28 gene expression
in G. sulfurreducens is likely regulated by RpoN. Interestingly, these results are similar to Campylobacter spp and
Vibrio spp, in which RpoN regulates the σ28 gene expression (see reviews and references within [48-50]). In other
bacterial species, e.g. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, the regulation of fliA is controlled by the FlhCD
transcriptional regulator [50]. FlhCD is absent from the G.
sulfurreducens genome, which also appears to lack FlhCD
binding sites [19]. It is interesting to note that C. jejuni
and V. cholerae use pili and flagella to achieve virulence
[50], whereas in Geobacter species, flagella and pili are
implicated in extracellular Fe(III) reduction [29,47] and
higher power production in microbial fuel cells [51].
Unique features of the G. sulfurreducens RpoN sigma
factor
In most bacteria that have been studied, the rpoN gene
deletion resulted in viable mutants or mutants requiring
certain nutrient addendum [8,52,53]. However, despite
the high amino acid sequence similarity of the G. sulfurreducens RpoN to other bacterial homologs, an rpoN null
mutant was not obtained after multiple attempts. The
only other case in which the rpoN gene is essential was
reported in Myxococcus xanthus, another delta-proteobacterium, for reasons that have yet to be elucidated [54].

This work also suggested that the expression of RpoN in G.
sulfurreducens is under a tight control in a complex manner for several reasons: (1) over-expression of RpoN
inhibited growth under various growth conditions, (2)
over-expression of RpoN induced up-regulation of genes
involved in stress responses (see Additional file 1), and
(3) our inability to isolate a viable rpoN deletion mutant
even in the presence of another copy of the rpoN gene, in
trans or in cis, which was under the control of artificial promoters such as the lac promoter or the promoter from the
chloramphenicol resistance gene. Furthermore, the G. sulfurreducens genome contains 28 genes encoding transcription factors from the EBP family, whose members are
required for transcription initiation directed by RNAP/
RpoN. This number of the EBPs is much higher than that
found in most bacteria. For instance, E. coli, which has a
larger genome (4.6 Mbp) than G. sulfurreducens (3.8
Mbp), has only 12 EBPs [4,55]. Approximately half of the
EBPs in G. sulfurreducens belong to two-component regulatory systems. This further suggests that cellular
responses to various environmental conditions are
directed by gene expression regulated by RpoN. It has

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/331

been reported for other bacteria that EBP-encoding genes
are often located adjacent or close to their target promoters ([3] and references within). This was also found to be
the case for some of the EBPs in G. sulfurreducens. It has
been shown that PilR, a member of the EBP family, regulates the pilA gene, which has an RpoN-dependent promoter and is located immediately downstream of the pilR
gene [30]. Genes encoding EBPs are also located upstream
of the dcuB and fdnG genes, which were shown to contain
an RpoN-dependent promoter (Figure 4). In addition, a
gene encoding an EBP is located upstream of GSU3364,
which was predicted to contain an RpoN-dependent promoter (see Additional file 4). However, it appears that G.
sulfurreducens EBPs are not always located adjacent or
close to their target promoters for the cases of fliL, glnB
(GSU1836), nifEN, and flgJ, which were shown to contain
an RpoN-dependent promoter in their regulatory regions
(Figure 4).
Data analysis-combining computational prediction with
microarray analysis
Due to the absence of an RpoN deletion mutant, our analyses were restricted to the use of an RpoN over-expressing
strain. Activation of RpoN-dependent transcription
requires the presence of EBPs activated by modification
such as phosphorylation, and therefore, an increase in the
amount of RpoN alone would not directly lead to increasing expression of every RpoN-regulated gene. This is
exactly what we have observed with our microarray analysis. With a relatively strong cutoff for false discovery rate
of p < 0.0005, the majority (~85%) of differentially
expressed genes had fold changes between 1.50 and 2.
When the results from the computational prediction are
compared with the results from the transcriptome analysis, the use of an arbitrary cutoff level may not be able to
detect all RpoN-regulated genes in the RpoN over-expressing strain. For instance, from the transcriptome analysis,
the fold change of the nifEN gene encoding a subunit of
nitrogenase complex was -1.34 (Table 2), while an RpoNdependent promoter for this gene was identified in G. sulfurreducens (Figure 4) and in other species [34]. Therefore,
it is likely that the fold change in expression of the nifEN
gene and other genes did not reach the 1.5 threshold due
to complexity of gene regulation in the RpoN overexpressing strain. In order to provide a broader list of
potential RpoN targets, we therefore provided a list of
genes predicted to be under control of RpoN-regulated
promoters (see Additional file 4), with predicted
sequences. To increase the possibility of capturing even
weaker effects of RpoN on gene expression, the threshold
level for expression changes was set at 1.25 for comparison of the microarray transcriptome analysis and the computer prediction (Table 2 and Additional file 5). By
lowering the cutoff of fold changes and by using additional validation by the primer extension assays, we were

Page 12 of 19

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:331

able to confirm RpoN regulatory elements located
upstream of operons/genes identified by both methods
(Table 2 &3), suggesting that this strategy is feasible.
The results from the transcriptome analysis and the
primer extension assays showed that RpoN-dependent
promoters can be found upstream of both up- and downregulated genes in the RpoN+ strain. For example,
increased transcript levels observed for some genes, such
as dcuB, could result from increased RpoN availability for
transcription initiation, which is the limiting factor at a
normal rpoN transcript level. Therefore, such genes were
up-regulated with the increase in the RpoN level. In contrast, excess RpoN may inhibit transcription due to lack of
proportional increase in EBPs and/or core RNAP, thereby
making excess RpoN an inhibitor or repressor instead of
an activator. This might be explained by the degree of the
conservation of the RpoN-recognition sequences. When
the RpoN-recognition sequences of glnB, dcuB, fliL, fdnG,
nifEN, and flgJ, for which their RpoN-recognition
sequences were identified by the primer extension assays
(Figure 4), were analyzed, it was found that the RpoN-recognition sequences of the genes repressed in the overexpressing strain (fliL, fdnG, nifEN, and flgJ) are slightly
more similar to the consensus of the RpoN-recognition
sequences (10 or 11 nucleotides conserved out of 13 consensus nucleotides) than those for the up-regulated genes
(glnB and dcuB, 9 nucleotides conserved out of 13 consensus nucleotides) (Figure 5a). This slight difference could
make significant difference in transcriptional activation
and repression. Therefore, RpoN might bind more tightly
to the promoters that are more similar to the consensus
and inhibit their transcription in the absence of a proportionally increased amount of an EBP for these promoters.
Furthermore, the decreased transcript levels for some
genes could also be due to "sigma factor antagonism" in
which other sigma factor(s) could not access the promoter
regions that were engaged by RpoN [28], or because less
core RNAP may be available for other sigma factors in the
excess of RpoN. It is likely that more than one sigma factor
and/or transcriptional regulators can affect gene expression in the same cell. For example, it has been proposed
that the transcription of RpoN-dependent promoters is
affected by ppGpp and its cofactor DksA through a mechanism in which more core RNAP are available for RNAP/
RpoN holoenzyme formation due to the short half life of
RNAP/RpoD induced by binding to ppGpp and DksA
[56,57]. Alternatively, the physiological states caused by
the overexpression of RpoN in the RpoN+ strain, which
were different from those in the WTV strain, such as slower
growth, and/or growth conditions, which affect gene regulation, such as fumarate respiration, resulted in positive
effects on some genes and negative effects on others. For
instance, the dcuB gene was up-regulated in the RpoN+
strain, because the active EBP was likely present for the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/331

activation of the dcuB gene under the conditions for the
microarray transcriptome analysis, during which cells
needed to grow on fumarate, and thus the fumarate/succinate exchanger encoded by the dcuB gene was required for
growth. In contrast, it is unlikely that the genes for nitrogen fixation such as nifEN were essential for growth in the
presence of ammonia and thus the active EBP for these
genes was scarce, if present, under the conditions for the
microarray transcriptome analysis, resulting in the inhibition of these genes in the RpoN+ strain. It is also possible
that RpoN may affect regulation of different promoters
under a different set of conditions or different stages of
cell growth.

Conclusion
The results presented here demonstrate that G. sulfurreducens has an RpoN ortholog, which exhibits typical structural characteristics shared by the RpoN family. However,
unlike most of other bacterial rpoN genes, the G. sulfurreducens rpoN was indispensable for growth under all conditions tested. By combining data from the computational
prediction with the microarray analysis of the RpoN overexpression strain, the regulon of G. sulfurreducens RpoN
was identified, which includes a number of genes that are
important for growth in subsurface environments and
microbial fuel cells. The G. sulfurreducens RpoN regulates
the expression of the dcuB gene encoding a fumarate/succinate exchanger, which is essential for fumarate respiration. The G. sulfurreducens RpoN controls both pathways
of glutamate/glutamine syntheses, including the GDH
(glutamate dehydrogenase) pathway and the GS/GOGAT
(glutamine synthase/glutamate synthase) pathway. Thus,
deletion of the rpoN gene would hinder cells' ability for
ammonia assimilation, and therefore this mutant would
not be viable. This study provides information on transcriptional regulatory networks in G. sulfurreducens, which
would increase the predictive value of the regulatory modules in the genome-wide in silico models. Further studies
for the RpoN transcriptional network in global regulation
in G. sulfurreducens are currently underway to fine-tune
the regulatory modules in the models.

1) and an rpoN diploid strain DLCN43. G. sulfurreducens
strains were routinely cultured anaerobically in NB acetate-fumarate (NBAF) or freshwater acetate-Fe(III) citrate
(FWAFC) medium at 30°C as previously described [61].
NB and FW are the two basic mineral solutions, and differ
mainly in buffering capacity and trace element contents.
Acetate (15 mM) and fumarate (40 mM) were the electron
donor and electron acceptor, respectively, for the general
propagation unless otherwise stated. Both can be substituted with either lactate (20 mM) or hydrogen as an electron donor, or Fe(III) citrate (55 mM) as an electron
acceptor when necessary (for a complete media composition please see references [61,62]).
DNA manipulations
Genomic DNA was extracted with the Qiagen Genomictip 100/G. Plasmid DNA and PCR products were purified
with the Qiagen mini plasmid purification kits and PCR
purification kits, respectively (Qiagen). DNA cloning and
other manipulations were carried out according to the
methods outlined by Sambrook et al. [63]. Restriction
enzymes and other DNA-modifying enzymes were from
New England Biolabs. Probes for Southern blot analyses
were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the NEBlot kit (New
England BioLabs). [α-32P]dCTP was from PerkinElmer
Life and Analytical Sciences. Qiagen Taq DNA polymerase, unless otherwise stated, was used for all PCR amplifications.
Single-step gene replacement
Sequences were deleted with single-step gene replacement
as previously described [64]. To disrupt the intergenic
regions either upstream (between rpoN (GSU1887) and
GSU1888) or downstream (between rpoN and GSU1886)
of the rpoN gene, a linear DNA fragment was generated by
recombinant PCR [64,65] from three primary PCR products. For disruption of the intergenic region upstream of
the rpoN gene, a 2.1 kb linear DNA fragment was composed of three PCR products: (1) the 3' end of GSU1888
(0.5 kb, amplified with primers rpoNU-1 and rpoNU-2);
(2) 5' end of the rpoN gene (0.5 kb, amplified with primers rpoNU-5 and rpoNU-6); and (3) a kanamycin resistant
cassette (KanR) (1.1 kb, amplified with primers rpoNU-3
and rpoNU-4). For disruption of the intergenic region
downstream of the rpoN gene, three primary PCR reactions were performed to amplify a 2.1 kb linear DNA fragment: (1) the 3' end of rpoN [0.5 kb, position to position,
amplified with primers rpoND-1 and rpoND-2); (2) 5'
end of the GSU1886 gene (0.5 kb, amplified with primers
rpoND-5 and rpoND-6); and (3) a KanR cassette (1.1 kb,
amplified with primers rpoND-3 and rpoND-4). Recombinant PCR was performed with these three PCR products
as templates with distal primer pairs, rpoNU-1/rpoNU-6
and rpoND-1/rpoND-6 for upstream or downstream
intergenic region mutation respectively. PCR conditions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/331

were as previously described, except that the annealing
temperature was 58°C [64]. All primer sequences used in
this work are listed in Additional file 7.
Electroporation, mutant isolation and genotype confirmation were performed as previously described [61,64].
One of each of the mutants, designated DLCN29 and
DLCN32, was chosen as the representative strain.
Construction of an rpoN diploid strain of G.
sulfurreducens (DLCN43)
A 2.5 kb linear DNA fragment containing the chloramphenicol resistance cassette (CmR) followed by the coding
region of the rpoN gene was constructed using cross-over
PCR [65]. The chloramphenicol resistance cassette was
amplified with Cm-rpoNF1 (Cla I site) and Cm-rpoNR2
using pACYC184 as the template. The rpoN gene was
amplified with C-rpoNF3 and C-rpoNR4. The two PCR
products were joined together by cross-over PCR as
described in [64,65]. The resulted PCR product (CmrpoN) was Klenow filled-in and ligated to the Sma I-cut
pLA01 (as described below), resulted in plasmid pLA03.

The plasmid pLA01 is a derivative of pCR2.1-TOPO that
the 5'-end of the periplasmic c-type cytochrome gene
(ppcA) which was amplified with primer pair: ppcAF1 and
ppcAR2 was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO using TOPO TA
cloning kit (Invitrogen). Therefore, plasmid pLA03 contains the 5'-end ppcA followed by Cm-rpoN: the CmR
resistance cassette and the rpoN gene, and the 3'-end of
ppcA. The plasmid pLA03 was linearized and electroporated into G. sulfurreducens DL1 and CmR transformants
were selected. The insertion of the Cm-rpoN construction
within the ppcA gene was verified by PCR and the resultant
strain was named DLCN43.
In order to interrupt any of the two copies of the rpoN
gene in DLCN43, a linear PCR fragment containing the
rpoN gene disrupted by the kanamycin resistance cassette
was constructed with cross-over PCR. The 5' region of
rpoN was amplified with primer pair: RpoNKmII-1 and
RpoNKmII-2. The 3' region of rpoN was amplified with
RpoNKmII-5 and RpoNKmII-6. The KanR cassette was
amplified with RpoNKmII-3 and RpoNKmII-4. The
recombinant PCR was carried out as described in the previous section and the resultant recombinant PCR product
was electroporated into the strain DLCN43. A total of 15
KanR transformants were isolated. However, all 15 transformants had the KanR insertion within the Cm-rpoN
locus.
Over-expression of rpoN in trans under the control of a
lac or an IPTG-inducible taclac promoter
The complete rpoN coding sequence was amplified with
primer sets RpoNfor-XbaI and RpoNrev-EcoRI for inser-

tion to pJMG (lac promoter, gentamycin resistant) [66,67]
or RpoNfor-EcoRI and RpoNrev-HindIII for insertion to
pCD341 (taclac promoter, kanamycin resistant) [68]
using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) under the following conditions: 98°C, 30 s
followed by 30 cycles of 98°C,20 s; 58°C, 20 s; 72°C, 60
s; and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR product of the rpoN coding sequence was digested with restriction enzyme sets of Xba I and EcoR I or EcoR I and Hind III
and inserted into the Xba I and EcoR I sites of the vector
pJMG or the EcoR I and Hind III sites of the vector pCD341
via ligation; the resulting plasmids were designated pJMG
rpoN or pCD rpoN, respectively. The rpoN gene in pJMGrpoN or pCDrpoN was then sequenced to screen for
PCR artifacts.
Following electroporation of strain DL1 with pJMGrpoN
or pCDrpoN, a gentamycin-resistant transformant or a
kanamycin-resistant transformant, was isolated and designated DL1/pJMGrpoN or DL1/pCDrpoN (RpoN+ for simplification), respectively. The presence of the plasmid in
the DL1 strain was confirmed by plasmid purification and
PCR.
The over-expression of rpoN for the strain containing
pCDrpoN was achieved by adding 1 mM IPTG, a nondegradable analog of lactose to the medium. In the
absence of lactose, transcription from the taclac promoter
is inhibited by the lacZ repressor [69]. Upon addition of
lactose or IPTG, the lacZ repressor is inactivated, therefore
inducing transcription of the rpoN operon.
Primer extension analyses
Total RNA was isolated from mid-exponential-phase cultures with RNeasy Midi kits (Qiagen) followed by treatment with RNase-free DNase (Ambion). Primer extension
experiments were performed at 42°C using AMV reverse
transcriptase (Roche) with primers GSU0364-06,
GSU0420-04, GSU0777-04, GSU0938-06, GSU1836-04,
GSU2005-02, GSU2302-04, GSU2490-02, GSU2751-02,
GSU2806–08, GSU3046-02, and GSU3206-06, respectively for the corresponding promoter regions. The
sequencing ladders presented in Figure 3 and Additional
file 6 were also generated with these same primers using
Thermo Sequenase Cycle sequencing kit (USB).
DNA microarray hybridization and statistical analysis
DNA microarray hybridization was carried out as previously described [70]. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from
three sets of identically treated batch cultures of the wild
type harboring an empty vector (DL1/pCD341 or WTV for
simplification) and the RpoN overexpressing strains
(RpoN+). Ten micrograms of RNA from the wild type and
the RpoN+ strain samples were chemically labeled with
Cy3 or Cy5 fluorescent dyes respectively, using the Micro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/331

Max ASAP RNA Labeling Kit (Perkin Elmer), according to
manufacturer's instructions. Labeled RNA was fragmented
in a 20 μl volume at 70°C for 30 min using Ambion's
Fragmentation Reagent and competitively hybridized to
12 K Arrays (Combimatrix) according to manufacturer's
protocol. The arrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000B
scanner (Molecular Devices), and analyzed using GenePix
and Acuity 4.0 software. LIMMA mixed model analysis (Rpackage LIMMA [71]) was applied to the normalized Log2
expression ratios to identify differentially expressed genes.
The P-value was then corrected for multiple comparisons
according to Benjamini and Hochberg's procedure [72] to
control the false discovery rate (FDR). Genes whose
expression was significantly changed are listed in Additional files 1 &2 according to their fold changes (≤ -1.5 for
down-regulation and ≥ +1.5 for up-regulation) and the Pvalues (≤ 0.0005). A gene was considered differentially
expressed if at least half of its probes had a P ≤ 0.0005 and
a fold change ≤ -1.5 or ≥ +1.5.
Gene expression microarray data (raw data and statistically processed data files) for the G. sulfurreducens overexpressing RpoN strain are available from the NCBI GEO
(Gene
Expression
Omnibus)
database
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/, with accession GSE8022.
Computational analysis of RpoN-regulated promoters and
their target operons
RpoN-regulated promoters were predicted in the genome
of G. sulfurreducens using the PromScan software [27].
This software assigned scores representing the KullbackLeibler distance for predicted RpoN sites in the G. sulfurreducens genome, based on 186 known RpoN promoter
sites from 47 bacterial species [2]. The predicted sequence
elements were ranked according to their PromScan scores,
and sequence elements with scores equal to or exceeding
the default cutoff of 80 were selected for further consideration.

The operon organization of the G. sulfurreducens genome
was predicted using a commercial version of the FGENESB
software (V. Solovyev, A. Salamov, and P. Kosarev, unpublished; Softberry, Inc; 2003–2008). The reference June 1,
2004 version of operon annotation used in this study has
been described previously [18]. For all RpoN-regulated
promoter elements predicted by PromScan, we compared
their genome location and strand orientation relative to
operons and singleton ORFs. Those sequence elements
that were located upstream of and in the same direction
with protein-coding genes were considered to be possible
RpoN-regulated promoter elements. Only those elements
that did not overlap with coding genes (according to gene
boundaries predicted by the FGENESB software) were
selected for further consideration.

To compare the predicted locations of RpoN-regulated
promoters with experimental evidence, we identified predicted RpoN promoters located upstream of and in the
same orientation with genes with significantly altered
expression in the RpoN+ strain. This was achieved by comparing the list of suggested target genes located downstream of RpoN promoters (see Additional file 4) to the
list of genes with significantly altered expression in the
RpoN+ strain and identifying the genes present in both
lists.
Consensus sequences of predicted RpoN promoters was
computed using our software, CONSENS by J. Krushkal
[73]. Each nucleotide reported in the output consensus
sequence represents the most frequent nucleotide. For
ambiguous nucleotides co-occurring with equal highest
frequencies, degenerate symbols were used according to
the IUPAC-IUB ambiguity codes. Sequence logos of the
predicted promoter sites were drawn using the WebLogo
package v. 3 beta at http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/[74].
In silico analysis of G. sulfurreducens growth
In silico modeling was utilized to analyze the possible phenotypes of G. sulfurreducens mutants in which genes
encoding enzymes for ammonia assimilation pathway
were deleted. The constraint-based genome-scale metabolic model of G. sulfurreducens [16] was applied in simulating cell growth using flux balance analysis and linear
optimization [75] in SimPheny (Genomatica, Inc., CA).
Biomass synthesis was selected as the objective function
to be maximized in growth simulations. The following
external metabolites were allowed to freely enter and
leave the network for simulations of anaerobic growth on
minimal media: Ca2+, CO2, Fe2+, H+, H2O, K+, Mg2+, Na+,
NH4+, PO43-, and SO42-. Acetate was supplied to the metabolic model as electron donor and Fe(III) or fumarate was
supplied as electron acceptor for the simulations. All other
external metabolites were only allowed to leave the system.
Preparation of antisera against RpoN
The rpoN coding region was amplified with primers
pGEXrpoNEcoRIfor and pGEXrpoNXhoIrev, digested
with EcoR I and Xho I, and inserted into the EcoR I-Xho I
sites of pGEX-4T-1 (GE). Competent E. coli strain JM109
was transformed with the resulting plasmid, pGEXrpoN.
The E. coli cell lysates containing the over-expressed GSTtagged RpoN was size-fractioned by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The band corresponding to RpoN protein was cut, crushed, and used to
immunize New Zealand rabbits for antibody production
against RpoN as described by Harlow and Lane [76].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/331

Analytical techniques
Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid method with bovine serum albumin as a
standard [77]. Western blot analyses were carried out by
using antiserum against RpoN according to the protocol
described by Ausubel et al [78]. Immunoreactive bands
were visualized using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Pierce) and 1-step
NBT/BCIP plus suppressor (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Growth of fumarate cultures was
monitored by measuring turbidity at 600 nm in a Genesys
2 spectrophotometer (Spectronic Instruments). Cell density of Fe(III)-grown cultures were determined using epifluorescence microscopy with acridine orange staining
[79]. Fe(II) concentrations were determined with the ferrozine assay as previously described [80]. Agglutination
assays were preformed as described by Reguera et al [31].
