Abstract
The correlation between epigenetic aberrations and disease underscores the importance of
epigenetic mechanisms. Here, we review recent findings regarding chromatin modifications and
their relevance to cancer.

Introduction
The development of tissues and organisms depends upon
the acquisition of distinct programs for gene expression
among individual cell types [1]. These programs are maintained in a heritable state by epigenetic mechanisms that
impart cellular memory [2]. In this way, the global synchronization of patterns in gene expression broadly dictates developmental consequences [3]. At the core of such
gene regulation are mechanistic pathways that affect the
packaging of DNA into chromatin, thereby establishing
the degree of DNA accessibility to transcriptional complexes [3-6]. These pathways include DNA methylation,
chromatin remodeling, histone replacement, and alterations to histone tails [4,7,8]. Aberrations in these epigenetic mechanisms are known to be associated with the
biology of cancerous lesions and their clinical outcome
[1,9,10].

Chromatin
From regulated gene expression to mitosis, chromatin acts
as a structurally flexible repository of the genome [11]. In
this manifestation, an entire chromosome is sequentially
compacted through a series of highly ordered packaging
while distinct regions of DNA are selectively made accessible to transcriptional complexes. Thus, chromatin maintains a dynamic architecture that allows approximately 2

m of DNA to be parceled in the nucleus while retaining a
remarkable degree of functionality [12].
At its foundation, chromatin is grounded in a succession
of nucleosomes, the basic structural unit [13], consisting
of 146 base pairs of DNA, wrapped 1.7 times around an
octamer of core histones and separated by a linker region
of approximately 50 base pairs. The primary histones
involved in the assembly of a nucleosome are histones
H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. These histones form hetero-dimers such that each is represented twice in the nucleosome
core unit [14].
The structure of each histone is highly conserved, including a folded core and an unstructured tail [15]. The histone core is a globular domain, forming a helix-turn-helix
motif, which facilitates dimerization. Conversely, histone
tails do not adopt defined conformations in crystal structures, except when bound to their recognition proteins
[15]. These tail domains contain a number of conserved
amino acid residues including lysine, arginine, and serine
[16]. Histone tails, which sustain a basic charge, can interact with the poly-anionic backbone of the core DNA, marginally contributing to nucleosome stability [17].
Therefore, regulation of chromatin structure and transcription is often mediated through post-translational

modifications that alter specific residues along these tails.
These modifications can affect the accessibility of nuclear
factors to DNA or induce the recruitment of such factors
involved in transcription or chromatin assembly pathways [18].
Histone-DNA interactions are formed primarily by rigid
hydrogen bonds between the histone main chain amide
and the phosphate oxygen of the DNA. These are strengthened by electrostatic interactions between basic side
chains and negatively charged phosphate groups and
other nonpolar interactions [19]. While this allows, in
theory, nucleosome formation on any DNA sequence,
there may be specific sequence preferences for nucleosomal positioning [20]. The nature of the underlying
DNA sequences, by which the histone core is wrapped,
could be the major determinant of the core histone displacement and the dynamic behavior of the nucleosome
under the influence of the SWI/SNF ATPase and sequencespecific transcription factors [21]. The best characterized
nucleosomal assembly is the 30 nm fiber, which is stabilized by linker histones [22-24] and the relative positioning of each nucleosome [25], ensuring intimate physical
proximity while producing minimal internucleosomal
attraction energy [26,27]. Thus, this structure allows dramatic changes in the degree of compaction to occur without a concomitant change in topology. Chromatin is
manifest in a number of additionally heightened states of
compaction [28], and higher order structures occur upon
interaction with non-histone, architectural proteins [29].
In the past three decades, a number of chromatin-related
events including DNA methylation, incorporation of histone variants, post-translational modifications of histones, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling have
been intensely studied. These modifications and the protein complexes involved with their facilitation have been
linked to the regulation of many biological processes
dependent upon the accessibility of chromatin [30-33].
These include gene expression, DNA repair, chromosome
segregation during mitosis, X chromosome inactivation,
and chromatin condensation during apoptosis [34-37].
Chromatin modifications impart epigenetic control of
gene expression without requisite changes in DNA
sequence. Disrupting the balance of epigenetic networks
has been linked to severe pathological consequences,
including tumorigenesis, syndromes involving chromosomal instability, and neurological disorders [38-40].
Recent advances in our understanding of chromatin structure/regulation and epigenetic inheritance have led to the
development of promising new therapies that target the
enzymes and complexes that are responsible [41].

DNA accessibility in transcriptional regulation
The structure of heterochromatin restricts physical access
of nuclear factors to the underlying DNA [42]. Regulation
of chromatin architecture is, therefore, necessary but not
sufficient for controlling gene expression. The activity of
sequence-specific activators, repressors, mediator complexes, and general transcription factors are also required
to manage transcriptional activity [43,44]. During transcriptional activation, the binding of gene-specific factors
to defined DNA sequences triggers a cascade of spatially
and temporally coordinated reactions. These result in a
chromatin template, appropriately remodeled, which
enhances the binding of ubiquitous transcription factors
and the general transcription machinery [45,46].
Transcription factors interact with specific sequences and
are divided into three classifications. General transcription factors are subunits of the RNA Polymerase II complex, which transcribes template DNA into messenger
RNA [47]. The upstream regulatory transcription factors
recognize consensus elements located in promoter
regions and act by increasing the efficiency of transcription initiation. General transcription factors and upstream
transcription factors are ubiquitous factors that require
accessible chromatin structure for DNA binding [47]. This
is accomplished by the third group of transcription factors
which induce the structural remodeling required to open
distinct regions of chromatin. These inducible factors are
gene-specific and are synthesized or activated at discrete
times and in distinct tissues. For example, nuclear receptors, which constitute a large family of ligand-inducible
transcription factors, have the capacity to bind to condensed chromatin templates [48]. The response of a given
receptor to a particular ligand depends on the set of coregulators with which it is able to interact. Recruited coregulators are able to covalently modify histones or
remodel nucleosomes in an ATP-dependent manner and
these alterations modulate the promoter accessibility to
both common transcription factors as well as the basal
transcriptional machinery [49]. Ultimately, transcriptional activation results from the integration of specific
and ubiquitous factor-binding at the promoter, suggesting
that the constitution of the promoter is of critical importance. Thus, the development of tools, such as genomewide location analysis, will significantly contribute
toward a heightened understanding of regulation at this
level [50].

ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling
Nucleosomal remodeling is an ATP-dependent process
that alters chromatin structure in a non-covalent manner
[51]. The complexes that facilitate this process are of fundamental importance because they affect the accessibility
of DNA to other complexes involved in transcription,
DNA repair, and replication. Thus, ATP-dependent chro-

matin remodeling can affect gene expression, cell cycle
progression, and cell differentiation [52].
Chromatin remodeling complexes are divided into several
classes, based on the variation within their catalytic
ATPase subunit. Although these subunits display homology within the ATPase domain, additional domains vary
among classes. For example, the SWI/SNF family contains
a bromo domain [53], the ISWI family contains a SANT
domain [54], and the Mi-2/NURD family, a chromo
domain [55]. Each ATPase associates with different subunits to form distinct multiprotein complexes and each
subunit may be differentially involved in the regulation or
targeting of remodeling activity.
Nagaich and colleagues studied the interaction between
the glucocorticoid receptor and an array of highly positioned nucleosomes, assembled on the mouse mammary
tumor virus long terminal repeat. They observed that
receptor binding to nucleosomal DNA is enhanced by
SWI/SNF and is accompanied by sequential reorganization of histone proteins within the nucleosomes. The
action of SWI/SNF is proposed to lead to changes in the
position of histone H2B within the nucleosome in concert
with the recruitment of GR to a new binding site within
the nucleosomal DNA [56]. Recent advances have allowed
nucleosome dynamics on promoters to be studied in real
time and support the idea that individual nucleosomes
may have an inherent capacity to "breathe" [57].

DNA methylation
Methylation of DNA is a covalent modification that can
occur at cytosines within CpG-rich regions of DNA and is
catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases [58]. The methylation of DNA affects the binding of proteins to their cognate DNA sequences [59]. Such addition of methyl groups
can prevent the binding of basal transcriptional machinery and ubiquitous transcription factors [60]. Thus, DNA
methylation contributes to epigenetic inheritance, allelespecific expression, inactivation of the X chromosome,
genomic stability and embryonic development [61]. It is
through these pathways that progressive DNA methylation is thought to be an agent both of normal aging as well
as neoplasias [62].
The majority of methylated CpG islands are located
within repetitive elements including centromeric repeats,
satellite sequences and gene repeats. These CpG regions
are often found at the 5' end of genes where DNA methylation affects transcription by recruiting methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) proteins that function as adaptors
between methylated DNA and chromatin-modifying
enzymes [63]. There is a clear relationship between DNA
methylation and other silencing mechanisms including
histone modifications and chromatin remodeling

http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/5/1/60

[64,65]. In fact, several studies suggest that DNA methylation affects genes that are already suppressed by other
mechanisms [62].

Histone modifications
Histone tail alterations encompass the greatest range of
variation in epigenetic regulation, encompassing more
than 50 known sites of modification [5]. Histones are subject to several forms of post-translational modification,
including methylation, citrullination, acetylation, phosphorylation, SUMOylation and ADP-ribosylation [16].
These modifications impart biological consequences by
acting as marks for the specific recruitment of regulatory
complexes and affecting the structure of the nucleosome.
Acting in concert, the combination of different histone
modifications is thought to constitute a "histone code"
that is interpreted in the form of specific nuclear events
[4,66].
Although the interplay among various histone modifications is still largely nebulous, a paradigm is rapidly emerging whereby methylation, acetylation, or phosphorylation
at independent sites may work in tandem with other such
modifications to convey unique biological consequences
[67]. Such crosstalk has already been clearly demonstrated
by a number of findings including the cooperation
between acetylation and phosphorylation of histone H3
during the cell cycle [68], the correlation between acetylation and argenine methylation in the regulation of estrogen-responsive genes [69], and the competition between
methylation and acetylation of histone H3, lysine 9
toward the establishment or disruption of heterochromatin [70]. As new studies continue to highlight the importance of crosstalk in epigenetic regulation, our early
understanding of singular histone modifications have
yielded to a more delicate model in which minor variations in broad patterns of modifications impart distinct
outcomes.
In 1964, Allfrey and colleagues noted a correlation
between increased histone acetylation and augmented
transcription [71]. Since then, much has been uncovered
regarding the affects of histone acetylation and this modification has been implicated in DNA replication, DNA
repair, and modulation of chromatin structure [72].
Hyper-acetylation of histone tails at lysine residues is
thought to influence transcriptional activity by neutralizing the positive charge of the histone tails and decreasing
their affinity for negatively charged DNA, thereby allowing access for transcription factors to promoters in the
chromatin [73-75]. Conversely, histone deacetylation is
believed to hinder the accessibility of DNA by restoring
the net positive charge [76]. In addition to charge-neutralization, more recent studies indicate that histone acetylation/deacetylation regulate transcription by altering

Molecular Cancer 2006, 5:60

higher-order folding properties of the chromatin fiber and
providing specific binding surfaces for the recruitment of
transcription co-regulators [74].
Near promoter sites, acetylation of histone amino-termini
provides binding surfaces for transcription factors of the
TFIID transcription initiation complex as well as for proteins in chromatin-remodeling complexes [77]. Agalioti
and colleagues have shown progressive acetylation of the
human interferon (IFN)-β gene upon transcriptional activation. Each acetylation pattern correlated with the
recruitment of a specific protein. The general transcription
factors GCN5 and TAFII250, the largest subunit of the
TFIID complex, are recruited to target promoter regions
and sequentially acetylate H4 lysine 8 and H3 lysine 9 and
14, respectively. In turn, H4 lysine 8 acetylation provides
a binding site for BRG1 that is part of the SWI/SNF complex that promotes ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling [77]. In addition to affecting chromatin dynamics
through alteration of histone tails, recent studies indicate
that acetylation of lysines at the edge of the histone globular domain is also possible and this modification facilitates the recruitment of chromatin remodeling complexes
in yeast [78].
The first cloned histone acetyltransferase (HAT) was
obtained from Tetrahymena thermophilia [79], and
sequence similarity with previously identified transcription factors such as CBP/p300, TAFII250, and SRC-1,
revealed that these transcriptional co-activators all possessed HAT activity [72,80]. These findings strengthen the
idea that local acetylation of histones by transcription factors contributes to the activation of promoter-specific
gene expression. Histone acetylases act as members of
large complexes, such that associating subunits can modulate HAT activity and substrate specificity. In addition,
HAT activity can be affected by sequence-specific transcription factors as well as other histone modifications
[81]. Homozygous deletions of distinct histone acetylases, in vivo, are manifest by disparate developmental
defects, suggesting a highly specialized functionality for
these enzymes [82].
Antagonism of HAT activity is achieved by a group of
enzymes called histone deacetylases (HDACs). Traditionally, these are thought to impart transcriptional repression
by catalyzing the removal of the acetyl moiety from histone lysines [81]. The first mammalian HDAC identified
is related to the yeast transcriptional regulator, Rpd3 [83].
Since then, additional HDACs have been discovered and
appropriately parceled into subclasses, based on sequence
homology with their yeast homologs. The human class I
histone deacetylases, similar to Rpd3, include HDACs 1,
2, 3 and 8. A second class, including HDACs 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
and 10, are similar to the yeast Hda1 and are regulated

http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/5/1/60

through subcellular localization. Class III HDACs, also
referred to as the sirtuins, exhibit significant sequence and
functional divergence from the class I and II groups [76].
This third class of HDACs displays NAD-dependent
deacetylase activity, similar to the yeast Sir 2 protein, and
play an essential role in epigenetic silencing [84].
Uniquely, class III HDACs are not sensitive to traditional
HDAC inhibitors such as trichostatin A or valproic acid.
Although the substrate specificity of distinct HDACs
remains nebulous, phylogenetic analysis reveals that
HDACs evolved in the absence of histone proteins, suggesting that key HDAC substrates may not be histones
[81]. In addition to its classic role, invoking transcriptional repression, contemporary studies have revealed
that deacetylation is also required at the promoters of
many transcriptionally active genes [85]. Thus, histone
deacetylation is an excellent example of the increasingly
paradoxical complexities of the "histone code."
Although acetylation of histone tails is largely ephemeral
in nature, histone methylation is widely observed to be a
mark that confers long-standing epigenetic memory [86].
Mounting evidence suggests that histone lysine methylation is a critical factor in such pathways as transcriptional
regulation, X chromosome inactivation, DNA methylation, and the formation of heterochromatin [34-36]. Catalyzed by histone methyltransferases, this modification
ultimately mediates either gene activation or silencing, in
a residue-dependent manner [86]. The level of specificity
is heightened by the variation in biological consequences
associated with whether a residue is mono-, di-, or trimethylated [87,88]. It has also been reported that many
transient histone modifications work in tandem with histone lysine methylation, further increasing the potential
complexity of this epigenetic modification [11].
Most histone lysine methyltransferases catalyze methyl
transfer by way of the SET domain, a module encoded
within many proteins that regulate diverse processes,
including some critical for development and proper progression of the cell cycle [4,36,89]. Residue-specific histone lysine methylation typically correlates with distinct
states of gene expression [90]. Most of the known targeted
lysines of histone methyltransferases occur on histone H3
which thereby serves as a conduit of such epigenetic regulation. In general, lysine methylation at histone H3, lysine
9 (H3K9), H3K27, and H4K20 corresponds with gene
silencing, whereas methylation of H3K4, H3K36, or
H3K79 is associated with actively transcribed genes [90].
Recent evidence implicates histone methylation in the
recruitment of chromatin remodeling complexes, as is the
case with CHD1, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor that specifically binds methylated H3K4 [91].
Although once thought to be a permanent modification,

Molecular Cancer 2006, 5:60

enzymes have now been identified that are capable of
reversing histone methylation at specific sites [86,92].
The incorporation of histone variants provides yet
another echelon to the capacity of epigenetic mechanisms
to store of cellular information [37]. Locally, it affects
nucleosome structure as well as the propensity of variantcontaining chromatin to be remodeled. Hence, histone
variant incorporation can alter nucleosome stability,
mobility, and potential patterns of histone modifications,
likely affecting higher order structure and downstream
events [93-95]. For example, a specialized H3-like variant
CENP-A, replaces H3 in centromeric nucleosomes to
maintain a unique structure that is critical for proper chromosomal segregation [96]. There are many additional
studies emphasizing the physiological relevance of histone variants and their significant role in epigenetic regulation [37].

Non-coding RNA
Accumulating evidence suggests the existence of RNA regulatory networks that are involved in the regulation of
gene expression at various levels [97]. It has been
observed that non-coding RNA, targeting CpG islands in
promoter regions, is able to act in concert with both DNA
and histone methylation to affect gene transcription [98100]. In fission yeast and in Drosophila, the involvement
of small interfering RNA has been studied in sequencespecific targeting of transgenes, transposable elements,
heterochromatin, and some cases of polycomb-mediated
gene silencing [101]. Although the current understanding
of the influence of non-coding RNA on transcriptional
activity is still incomplete, this is an exciting new front in
the field of epigenetic modifications that promises to possess answers to broader questions on transcriptional regulation [102].

Epigenetic aberrations and Cancer
Clearly, the regulation of chromatin structure is a complex
and dynamic process. It is modulated at several levels by
distinct mechanisms such as DNA methylation, nucleosome remodeling, histone post-translational modifications, incorporation of histone variants, and non-coding
RNA. Aberrations in such epigenetic mechanisms are
likely to impact gene expression as well as other physiologically critical processes such as chromosome condensation, segregation, and apoptosis.
Several lines of evidence indicate that tumorigenesis in
humans is a multistep process in which a succession of
genetic changes leads to the progressive conversion of
normal cells. While genetic alterations can account for
some of theses changes, many of the alterations in gene
expression observed with cancer are caused by epigenetic
modifications [103]. These observations highlight the rel-

http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/5/1/60

evance of epigenetic mechanisms toward the establishment of proper cellular function. Misregulation of these
mechanisms cooperates with genetic mutations and contributes to the establishment and progression of neoplastic diseases.
Although a loss-of-function for a remodeling complex
subunit is not likely sufficient to induce oncogenesis, such
an abnormality could enhance the cascade of events leading to oncogenic transformation, when exhibited in tandem with specific genetic mutations [104]. Alterations of
remodeling complex activity in various mammalian cells
and organs was correlated to differential global and sitespecific genomic methylation patterns [105-107] as well
as to impaired histone post-translational modifications
[108]. These observations underscore the importance of
chromatin remodeling factors in the regulation of gene
expression during development and in disease [109]. In
one example, Brg1 null mice lack the functional ATPase
catalytic unit of the SWI/SNF remodeling complex and are
embryonic lethal [110]. In adults, altered expression of
Brg1 is observed in subsets of lung, breast, prostate, and
pancreatic cancers. Additionally, in the familial cancers
termed the "rhabdoid predisposition syndrome," predisposition is inherited through specific inactivating mutations of the SNF5 subunit present in all SWI/SNF
complexes [111]. Other such mutations to chromatin
remodeling complexes have been associated with oncogenesis and much effort is being allocated toward the
potential for therapeutic intervention at this level [112].
Imbalance of histone acetylation/deacetylation in promoter regions contributes to the deregulation of gene
expression and has been associated with carcinogenesis
and cancer progression [113,114]. Both, histone acetylases and deacetylases have central roles in regulating the
access and recruitment of transcription factors to DNA
regulatory elements and in the regulation of other posttranslational modifications at the lysine residues. The
high conservation of acetylase/deacetylase complexes
illustrates the importance of their function in cell proliferation and differentiation. Translocation, amplification,
over-expression, or mutations of HAT genes occurs in a
variety of human pathologies [80,115,116] and chromosomal translocations that lead to the fusion of transcription factors to HATs or HDACs have been linked to
hematological malignancies such as certain leukemias
[115].
The aberrant targeting of HAT or HDAC activity to specific
gene promoters can result from the fusion of transcription
factors with protein domains that retain co-repressor or
co-activator binding capacity. Acute promyelocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia are caused by chromosomal translocations leading to the expression of

Molecular Cancer 2006, 5:60

transcription factors fused to the nuclear receptor RAR or
to the zinc finger nuclear protein ETO, respectively, which
contain co-repressor interaction domains [117,118]. The
progression of these leukemias is linked to the abnormal
recruitment of the N-CoR/SMRT co-repressor complex
containing histone deacetylase activity which acts by
blocking differentiation and allowing uncontrolled
growth of hematopoietic cells [117,118]. More recent
studies demonstrate that the transcriptional repression of
target genes by fusion proteins in leukemia is reinforced
by epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation.
These epigenetic marks are then maintained throughout
multiple cell divisions [119].
The misregulation of DNA methylation is another epigenetic irregularity known to contribute to the initiation and
progression of tumorigenesis [120]. Indeed, changes in
the pattern of DNA methylation were correlated with
altered histone post-translational modifications and
genetic lesions. Either hypermethylation or hypomethylation have been identified in all types of cancer cells examined, to date. Hypomethylation at centromeric repeat
sequences has been linked to genomic instability [121]
whereas local hypermethylation of individual genes has
been associated with aberrant gene silencing [122]. In
oncogenic cells, hypermethylation is often correlated with
the repression of tumor suppressor genes while
hypomethylation is associated with the activation of
genes required for invasion and metastasis [123-127].
New techniques, such as the polymerase chain reaction
amplification of bisulfite-modified DNA, have enabled
the study of patterns of DNA methylation. This method is
currently being improved and adapted for cancer cell
identification, profiling of tumor-suppressor-gene expression, and prognostic factors that are linked to CpG island
hypermethylation [128-130]. The DNA methylation patterns may become invaluable in cancer patient prognosis
and its potential as a biomarker is currently under investigation [131].
Accumulating evidence implicates the aberrant loss or
gain of histone methyltransferase (HMTase) activity in
tumorigenesis. For example, mice which fail to express the
H3K9-specific HMTase, SUV39H1, are subject to heightened chromosomal instability and consequent oncogenic
potential [132]. Conversely, it is over-expression of
Smyd3, an H3K4-targeting HMTase, that has been linked
to proliferation of tumor cells [133]. Since the initial finding, linking Smyd3 to hepatomas and colorectal carcinomas, a polymorphism involving a transcription factor
binding element in the upstream regulatory sequence for
Smyd3 has been linked to a heightened risk for oncogenesis [134,135]. Consequently, suppression of Smyd3
expression has been the subject of several recent therapeutic studies [136-138].

http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/5/1/60

Apart from their ability to covalently modify histones, two
histone methyltransferases have been shown to methylate
the p53 tumor suppressor, directly. Set9, which methylates H3K4 [139,140], has also been implicated in the regulation of p53 by methylating that protein at lysine 372.
Methylation of this site stabilizes p53 and limits its localization to the nucleus [141]. More recently, Smyd2, which
methylates H3K36 and augments proliferation of NIH3T3
cells [3], has also been directly linked to the regulation of
p53. By methylating lysine 370 of p53, Smyd2 inhibits the
activity of that protein in transcriptional regulation [142].
Current and future studies on the ability of HMTases to act
directly on oncoproteins and tumor suppressors will
undoubtedly open an exciting new frontier in therapeutic
intervention.
Assuming that epigenetic changes do not solely affect protein expression but also the expression of non-coding
RNAs, anomalous epigenetic regulation may have drastic
impacts on biological processes involving regulatory
RNAs [143]. Analyzing non-coding RNA profiles revealed
that distinct patterns were associated with specific cancer
types, developmental lineages, and differentiation states
of the tumors [144]. A range of evidence supports that
micro-RNA profiling will be useful in diagnosis, prognosis, and management of human cancers in the near future
[145-147]. However, the precise role of non-coding RNA
in the generation, maintenance, and progression of
tumors remains to be determined as does the link
between variations in non-coding RNA profiles and epigenetic alterations.

Conclusion
Although chromatin states, once initiated, can be epigenetically maintained and inherited, several studies support that epigenetic control of gene expression may be
altered by environmental stressors/toxicants or carcinogens. These alterations may, in turn, compromise genome
integrity and stability. Clearly distinguished from genetic
mutations, these epigenetic alterations have been termed
"epimutations" and must be actively maintained, in contrast to genetic mutations, which are inherited passively
through DNA replication [148]. Such epimutations rarely
appear in healthy tissues, indicating that epigenetic therapies may have high tumor specificity. Furthermore, in
contrast to genetic deletions, causing irreversible loss of
gene function, epigenetic modifications are reversible,
making them attractive targets for therapeutic intervention [149]. To restore normal expression of tumor suppressors, by reversing these epimutations, has
consequently become a new therapeutic ambition in cancer treatment. Indeed, aberrant gene silencing mediated
by DNA methylation and histone deacetylation can be
reversed by DNA methyltransferase inhibitors [150] and
histone deacetylase inhibitors [151], respectively. In

many tumor cell lines, promising results have been
obtained after treating cells with such pharmacological
agents [152-155]. Resetting normal patterns of gene
expression is often achieved and cell differentiation or
apoptosis is restored. However, preliminary results of
ongoing clinical trials suggest that the outcome of such
treatments depends on the exact defects of the cancer cell
itself, which can be a combination of genetic and epigenetic changes, such that tandem implementation with
other anticancer therapies may be most successful.
In the last decade, great strides have been made toward
our understanding of chromatin structure and its role in
the regulation of nuclear processes. Recognizing patterns
of histone post-translational modifications, deciphering
the relationship between these modifications and DNA
methylation, and characterizing the relevance of epigenetic alterations in neoplasias encompass a new frontier
in the etiology of cancer. Thus, the examination of epigenetic aberrations is sure to be a progressively critical factor
in the diagnosis and treatment of malignancies.
