Abstract
Background: Outbreaks of the casuarina moth, Lymantria xylina Swinehoe (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae), which is a
very important forest pest in Taiwan, have occurred every five to 10 years. This moth has expanded its range of
host plants to include more than 65 species of broadleaf trees. LyxyMNPV (L. xylina multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus)
is highly virulent to the casuarina moth and has been investigated as a possible biopesticide for controlling this
moth. LdMNPV-like virus has also been isolated from Lymantria xylina larvae but LyxyMNPV was more virulent than
LdMNPV-like virus both in NTU-LY and IPLB-LD-652Y cell lines. To better understand LyxyMNPV, the nucleotide
sequence of the LyxyMNPV DNA genome was determined and analysed.
Results: The genome of LyxyMNPV consists of 156,344 bases, has a G+C content of 53.4% and contains 157
putative open reading frames (ORFs). The gene content and gene order of LyxyMNPV were similar to those of
LdMNPV, with 151 ORFs identified as homologous to those reported in the LdMNPV genome. Two genes (Lyxy49
and Lyxy123) were homologous to other baculoviruses, and four unique LyxyMNPV ORFs (Lyxy11, Lyxy19, Lyxy130
and Lyxy131) were identified in the LyxyMNPV genome, including a gag-like gene that was not reported in
baculoviruses. LdMNPV contains 23 ORFs that are absent in LyxyMNPV. Readily identifiable homologues of the
gene host range factor-1 (hrf-1), which appears to be involved in the susceptibility of L. dispar to NPV infection,
were not present in LyxyMNPV. Additionally, two putative odv-e27 homologues were identified in LyxyMNPV. The
LyxyMNPV genome encoded 14 bro genes compared with 16 in LdMNPV, which occupied more than 8% of the
LyxyMNPV genome. Thirteen homologous regions (hrs) were identified containing 48 repeated sequences
composed of 30-bp imperfect palindromes. However, they differed in the relative positions, number of repeats and
orientation in the genome compared to LdMNPV.
Conclusion: The gene parity plot analysis, percent identity of the gene homologues and a phylogenetic analysis
suggested that LyxyMNPV is a Group II NPV that is most closely related to LdMNPV but with a highly distinct
genomic organisation.

Background
Baculoviruses (family Baculoviridae) consist of rodshaped, arthropod-specific viruses with double-stranded,
circular DNA genomes ranging from 80 to 180 kb and
enveloped nucleocapsids [1]. The occluded form of the
virus is embedded in proteinaceous occlusion bodies
(OBs) [1]. Baculoviridae is subdivided into four genera,

Alphabaculovirus (lepidopteran-specific nucleopolyhedrovirus, NPV), Betabaculovirus (lepidopteran-specific
granulovirus), Gammabaculovirus (hymenopteran-specific NPV) and Deltabaculovirus (dipteran-specific NPV)
[2]. The lepidopteran-specific NPVs are further classed
into two groups, I and II, based on the phylogenetic
analysis of their polyhedrin (polh) genes [3,4]. Most of
the NPVs with sequenced genomes are lepidopteran
specific. However, the genomes of Culex nigripalpus
NPV, which infects dipteran, and three Neodiprion
NPVs which have been isolated from hymenopteran
insect species, have also been sequenced [5-8]. To date,
more than fifty baculovirus isolates have been sequenced

(NCBI, GenBank). Baculoviruses are used worldwide as
protein expression vectors, biotechnological tools and
biological control agents of agricultural and forest pests.
The casuarina moth, Lymantria xylina Swinehoe
(Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae), is an herbivore that feeds
on casuarina (Casuarina equisetifolia), guava (Psidium
guajava L.), longan (Euphoria longana Lam.), lychee
(Litchi chinensis Sonn.), acacia (Acacia confusa) forests
and more than 60 other species of host plants [9,10]. It
is native to Taiwan, Japan, India, and the eastern coast
of mainland China [11]. In the last 30 years in Taiwan,
many forests have been converted to agricultural land.
The moth has expanded into these newly established
agricultural areas and simultaneously expanded its host
plant range [12]. L. dispar is a closely related species to
L. xylina [13]. The L. dispar MNPV (LdMNPV) isolated
from its natural host, L. dispar, had been characterised
and sequenced in 1999 [14] and used in integrated pest
management (I.P.M.) programs to control this pest for
many years in America [15].
NPV epizootics occur in populations of L. xylina each
year from spring to early summer in Taiwan and mainland China, and the key pathogen was found to be L.
xylina multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (LyxyMNPV) [16].
Following the establishment of an in vitro propagation
system for LyxyMNPV in the cell lines IPLB-LD652Y
(LD) and NTU-LY (LY) [17,18], LyxyMNPV and hostvirus interaction studies were promoted. In previous tissue culture infectivity studies of three lymantriid NPVs
(LyxyMNPV, LdMNPV, and Orgyia pseudotsugata
MNPV), only one cell line, IPLB-LD-652Y, was able to
support infection and replication of all three NPVs
[17,19,20]. Additionally, Perina nuda NPV (PenuNPV),
which was isolated from P. nuda, could also infect both
LY and LD cells and L. xylina larvae in our laboratory
[18]. Of these Lymantriidae-derived NPV species, LyxyMNPV/LdMNPV and PenuNPV/OpMNPV were
thought to be closely related [17,21]. However, molecular evidence has supported them as distinct species
[12,16]. Therefore, the precise relationship between LyxyMNPV and LdMNPV needs to be further clarified. In
our previous study, LyxyMNPV and another less prevalent NPV species were shown to coexsist in the infected
larvae in the fields of Taiwan [12]. The less prevalent
NPV was isolated and characterised as LdMNPV-like
virus [12].
In this study, we reported the complete genomic
sequence of LyxyMNPV, which is the most prevalent
virus strain in the infected L. xylina larvae and described
the whole genomic sequence, gene structure and performed a phylogenetic analysis. The genome sequences
were compared to the previously published LdMNPV
[14] and group I NPV type species, Autographa californica MNPV [22]. Because OpMNPV [23] is another

Page 2 of 14

Lymantriidae-derived NPV species that can infect LD
cells and Maruca vitrata MNPV (MaviMNPV) [24] can
also infect LD cells at low level, these two group I NPVs
were also compared to LyxyMNPV.

Results and Discussion
General characteristics of the LyxyMNPV genome

The LyxyMNPV genome size is 156, 344 bp [GenBank:
GQ202541] and has a G+C content of 53.4% (see Additional file 1). ORFs were predicted according to the
initial criteria for further study. However, three ORFs
that had large overlap found in LyxyMNPV were also
selected for further study, namely Lyxy37, Lyxy72 and
Lyxy139 (arif-1). Lyxy37 (281 aa) overlaps with Lyxy36
(p26) by 192 aa in the same direction, but not in the
same frame. A P10 homologue (77 aa) was found
located in the C-terminal portion of Lyxy37 (from 205
aa to 281 aa), designated as Lyxy37’. Lyxy72 (homologous to Ld76) is 380 aa long and overlaps with Lyxy71
(bro-g) and Lyxy73 by 182 aa and 119 aa, respectively.
Lyxy139 (arif-1), which is 272 aa long, overlaps with
Lyxy138 (pif-2) and Lyxy140 by 182 aa and 73 aa,
respectively. Therefore, a total of 157 ORFs were identified for further analysis (Fig. 1, Additional file 2), and
nucleotides in the LyxyMNPV genome were numbered
sequentially, beginning with the A (designated position
1) of the polyhedrin start codon (ATG). The directions
of the transcripts are indicated by arrows. The ratio of
the ORF orientations was almost equal to 1:1 [clockwise
(79/157): anticlockwise (78/157)] for those oriented
clockwise with respect to the orientation of the polh
gene [25] (ORF1). Most of the 157 LyxyMNPV ORFs
have an assigned function or homologues in other baculoviruses. As shown in Table 1, four unique ORFs were
found in the LyxyMNPV genome. There are 30 conserved genes in all baculovirus genomes, including the
dipteran and hymenopteran baculoviruses [6,26,27] and
all of these genes were found in the LyxyMNPV genome. A total of 14 baculovirus-repeated ORFs (bro
genes, ly-bro-a to ly-bro-n) were also sequenced. Beside
these 157 predicted ORFs, other internal spaces were
made up of intergenic spaces and homologous regions
(hrs). The LyxyMNPV genome has 13 hrs (hr1, 2, 3a,
3b, 3c, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8a, 8b, 8c and hr9) (Fig. 1 and Additional file 2), and the orientations of the hrs were related
to those of LdMNPV (Additional file 2).
Promoter analysis

Promoter motifs present upstream of the 157 putative
ORFs were screened. 14 LyxyMNPV ORFs were shown
to possess consensus early gene promoter motif (Additional file 2). Three of these ORFs, Lyxy7, Lyxy10 (odve56) and Lyxy126 (efp/ld130), were also shown to possess consensus late gene promoter motif, which may

allow transcription of these genes during both the early
and late stages of infection. This has also been reported
for Ac128 (gp64) and Ac147 (ie-1) [28,29]. A total of 73
LyxyMNPV ORFs were shown to possess consensus late
gene promoter motif. Additionally, the upstream 210 bp
of 50 LyxyMNPV ORFs had an enhancer-like element
consisting of a CGTGC motif (Additional file 2). A total
of 48 LyxyMNPV ORFs did not possess consensus late
or early promoter sequences. It seems likely that additional, as-yet-unidentified, promoter sequences might
exist within the LyxyMNPV genome, as in other

baculoviruses [28,29]. Unlike most baculoviruses, the
p74 of LyxyMNPV lacks a late promoter [14].
Comparison of LyxyMNPV ORFs to other baculoviruses

LyxyMNPV shares 109 ORFs with AcMNPV, 100 ORFs
with OpMNPV, 93 ORFs with MaviMNPV, 151 with
LdMNPV, 107 with SeMNPV and 76 with CpGV (Cydia
pomonella GV). The average amino acid sequence identity between LyxyMNPV and AcMNPV [22], OpMNPV
[23], MaviMNPV [24], LdMNPV [14], SeMNPV [30]
and CpGV [31,30] were 32.68%, 33.19%, 33.28%, 74.71%,
37.3% and 25.63%, respectively. Four ORFs (Lyxy11,
Lyxy19, Lyxy130 and Lyxy131) were identified unique to
LyxyMNPV (Additional file 2). Three pairs of adjacent
AcMNPV ORFs (Ac58/Ac59, Ac106/Ac107, and Ac112/
Ac113) were fused together into single ORFs (Lyxy58,
Lyxy115 and Lyxy105, respectively) in LyxyMNPV. As
reported for Rachiplusia ou MNPV-R1, re-sequencing of
these regions in AcMNPV-C6 had found that the ORF
pairs occurred as a single ORF in the stock of
AcMNPV-C6 [32]. The homologues of these ORFs were
also found in other baculovirus genomes in which they
are fused into a single ORF. Three adjacent LdMNPV
ORFs (Ld133/Ld134/Ld135) that were in the same

Nai et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:116
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/116

orientation were also fused into a single ORF (Lyxy122)
in LyxyMNPV.
GeneParityPlot analysis

Comparisons of the gene arrangement of the selected
ORFs are shown in Fig. 2. The gene arrangement of the
LyxyMNPV genome was highly colinear to that of
LdMNPV. However, a large fragment flanked by
Lyxy109 (bro-i) and Lyxy142 (bro-j) in the LyxyMNPV
genome showed an inversion compared to LdMNPV
(Fig. 2a). The gene arrangement of the LyxyMNPV genome showed lower colinearity to AcMNPV, OpMNPV,
MaviMNPV and SeMNPV. In contrast, the parity analysis of the LyxyMNPV and CpGV ORFs displayed a
much more dispersed pattern.
LyxyMNPV structural genes

Compared to the 25 baculovirus structural genes listed
by Hayakawa et al. (1999), Herniou et al., (2003) and
Jehle et al. (2006)[2,26,33], only two genes were identified to be absent in the LyxyMNPV genome. These
genes included the protein tyrosine phosphatase gene
(ptp) and group I NPV-specific gp64 (see Additional file
3), which is the major envelope fusion protein gene of
AcMNPV [22], Bombyx mori MNPV (BmNPV) [34],
OpMNPV [23] and Epiphyas postvittana NPV
(EppoNPV) [35]. The GP64 protein appears to be
unique to group I NPVs [36,37]. In LdMNPV, the F
protein, an envelope fusion protein functionally analogous to the GP64 protein, is a product of the Ld130
gene. LyxyMNPV encodes an F protein homologue,
Lyxy126, which shows 96% aa identity to Ld130. Ld130
homologues are present in all lepidopteran and dipteran
baculoviruses that have been completely sequenced,
including those that contain gp64. The role of the
Ld130 homologue in the latter species is unclear, but it
is likely that they have lost their envelope fusion properties [37,38]. Of these structural proteins, the polyhedrin
protein was the most conserved (100% identity). In contrast, the products of genes pif-2, orf1629 and vp80
showed the lowest levels (75%, 71% and 69%, respectively) of sequence conservation between LyxyMNPV
and LdMNPV (Additional file 2). A special characteristic
of LyxyMNPV is that Lyxy15 and Lyxy155 are homologous to odv-e27. Lyxy15 is flanked by homologues of
Ld17 and Ld19, while Lyxy155 is close to LyxyMNPV
hr9 and located between Lyxy154 and Lyxy156 which
are homologues of Ld161 and Ld162, respectively. The
identity between Lyxy15 and its LdMNPV homologue
(Ld18) is up to 84%. However, the identity between the
two LyxyMNPV odv-e27 genes is quite low (18%) which
is not significantly higher than that to the AcMNPV,
MaviMNPV or SeMNPV even AnpeNPV homologues
(Additional file 2). The region of Lyxy155 has probably

Page 4 of 14

undergone extensive rearrangement, because Ld18
homologue gene of other different baculoviruses is
located in the similar site of Lyxy15. Therefore, it is possible that Lyxy155 was acquired from other NPV species
(AcMNPV, MaviMNPV, SeMNPV or AnpeNPV). In
AcMNPV, the ODV-E27 protein was incorporated into
both the envelope and capsid of the occluded virus [39].
However, only odv-e27 (Lyxy15) of LyxyMNPV has a
late promoter motif. Therefore, it is possible that only
one odv-e27 is transcribed in LyxyMNPV, and that it
serves as a structural protein of the envelope and capsid
of an occluded virus. It is notable that p10 (designated
as Lyxy37’) of LyxyMNPV has a large N-terminal extension. The identity between Lyxy37’ and its LdMNPV
homologue (Ld41) is up to 87%, which is much higher
than that of Lyxy37 and Ld41 (23%). Lyxy37 has early
and late promoter motifs, but Lyxy37’ has only one late
promoter motif. There may be two forms of p10 found
in the early and late stages of LyxyMNPV-infected larvae or cells. The average identity of these structural proteins was generally 86.5% between LyxyMNPV and
LdMNPV (Additional file 2), suggesting that the structure of the viruses may be similar.
Transcription-specific genes

The genes involved in baculovirus late gene transcription that are present on other baculovirus genomes are
also present in the LyxyMNPV genome, with no exceptions, including lef 4-6, 8-11, 39K, p47 and vlf-1 [40].
These genes are found in LyxyMNPV as Lyxy89,
Lyxy96, Lyxy34, Lyxy48, Lyxy61, Lyxy54, Lyxy41,
Lyxy40, Lyxy44 and Lyxy82, respectively. Most of these
genes were 80%-96% identical in amino acid sequences
to those of LdMNPV. However, we noted that the
amino acid identity of LdMNPV lef-6 and LyxyMNPV
lef-6 aa was only 64%.
DNA replication and repair genes

A total of 19 lef genes in AcMNPV have been implicated in DNA replication and transcription [41]. Baculovirus early genes are transcribed by the host cell RNA
polymerase II, but this is often transactivated by genes
such as ie-0, ie-1, ie-2 and pe38 [42]. Of these genes, ie0 and ie-1 are present in LyxyMNPV. Six baculovirus
genes have previously been reported as essential DNA
replication factors for baculoviruses, including lef-1, lef2, lef-3, DNApol, helicase and ie-1 [43], which are all
present in LyxyMNPV. These genes are conserved with
respect to those of LdMNPV (81%-91%), with the exception of lef-3 (41%). Homologues of a single-stranded
DNA-binding protein (dbp) [44] and an immediate-early
gene, me53, both of which have been implicated in
DNA replication, were also found in LyxyMNPV. Additionally, similar to LdMNPV, LyxyMNPV also has two

dbp (Lyxy33 and Lyxy43). The amino acid sequence
identities of the two DBP to those of LdMNPV were
75% and 80% for Lyxy33 and Lyxy43, respectively. However, the amino acid identity was very low between the
two (19%). Genes for enzymatic functions in nucleotide
metabolism, such as the large (rr1) and small (rr2) subunits of ribonucleotide reductase and deoxyuridyltriphosphate (dutpase), which are found in several
baculoviruses, were also present in LyxyMNPV, with the
exception of rr1. Three genes that encode ribonucleotide
reductase were found in LdMNPV. These include a
homologue of the large subunit and two homologues of
the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase copies
[14]. The rr2 of LyxyMNPV (Lyxy137) was more similar
to Ld120 (rr2b, 86%) than to Ld147 (rr2a, 16%) homologues. These enzymes are involved in nucleotide metabolism and catalyse the reduction of host cell rNTPs to
dNTPs [45]. In addition, the homologues of non-essential DNA replication stimulatory genes, ie-2, lef-7 and
pe38 [46], which were unique in group I NPV, were not
present in LyxyMNPV.
Genes with auxiliary functions

Auxiliary genes are not essential for viral replication, but
provide a selective advantage to increase virus production/survival either at the cellular level or at the level of
the organism [47]. A total of thirteen auxiliary genes
have homologues in LyxyMNPV, including proteinkinase-1 (pk-1), p10, ubiquitin (ubi), conotoxinlike peptide2 (ctl-2), chitinase, cathepsin L-like proteinase (v-cath),
superoxide dismutases (sod), viral enhancing factor-1,
(vef-1), vef-2, ecdysteroid UDP glucosyltransferase (egt),
actin rearrangement-inducing factor-1 (arif-1), viral
fibroblast growth factor (vfgf) and alkaline exonuclease
(alk-exo). Almost all of these auxiliary genes in LyxyMNPV were 81%-95% identical in amino acid sequence
to those of LdMNPV, except arif-1 and ctl-2. LyxyMNPV arif-1 was 64% identical to that of LdMNPV
and its ctl-2 was 66% and 40% identical to OpMNPV
and LdMNPV, respectively.
Conotoxins are small disulfide-rich ion channel
antagonists isolated from the gastropod genus Conus
[48]. A single ctl gene is present in AcMNPV (Ac3). In
contrast, the LdMNPV and OpMNPV genomes encode
two ctl genes, called ctl-1 and ctl-2. However, there is
only one ctl gene (ctl-2) found in LyxyMNPV, which
has low amino acid identity to LdMNPV. This is
because LdMNPV ctl-2 has a longer amino acid size (92
aa) than the other baculovirus ctls. The biological function of CTL remains unclear, as no difference in mortality, motility, or weight gain was observed when neonate
or late instar Spodoptera frugiperda larvae were infected
with the AcMNPV ctl-1 deletion mutant compared to
infection with wild-type virus [49].

The large VEF protein is metalloprotease that appears
to degrade mucin and is thought to facilitate the
approach of baculoviral virions to the surface of gut
cells by disrupting the peritrophic membrane [50]. This
protein forms ~5% of the mass of OBs of the Trichoplusia GV [51]. The vef gene does not exist in the
AcMNPV [22] or OpMNPV [23] genomes, but
LdMNPV has two vef genes, vef-1 and vef-2. Previous
studies have revealed that both LdMNPV enhancins
contributed to viral infectivity [52,53]. Two copies of vef
(vef-1 and vef-2) have been identified in the LyxyMNPV
genome (Lyxy62 and Lyxy153). The two gene products
show low amino acid identity to each other (29%). Auxiliary genes that are present in other lepidopteran NPVs
but are not in LyxyMNPV include pcna, pk-2, ptp-1 and
ctl-1.
Anti-apoptosis genes

Apoptosis or cell death can be a mechanism to defend
against the establishment of infections and is usually
triggered in the early period of virus infection. Baculoviruses possess two families of genes that suppress apoptosis: the p35/p49 family and the inhibitor of apoptosis
(IAP) family. It has been shown that p35 blocks diverse
pathways of apoptosis and plays a role in blocking
AcMNPV-induced apoptosis in Sf21 cell [54]. This gene
has been reported in a number of baculoviruses, such as
AcMNPV, BmNPV, RoMNPV, S. litura MNPV
(SpltMNPV) and MaviMNPV [22,24,32,34,55].
The iap family of genes have been found in all family
members of the Baculoviridae sequenced to date. IAP
homologues generally contain two baculovirus IAP
repeats (BIR), which are associated with binding to
apoptosis-inducing proteins, and a C-terminal zinc finger-like (RING) Cys/His motif [56]. These features have
enabled the iap genes to be divided into five groups
from iap-1 to iap-5 [31]. Apoptotic inhibition has been
recovered in AcMNPV p35 deletion mutants with a
variety of baculovirus iap homologues [57]. In the LyxyMNPV genome, two iaps were observed, iap-2
(Lyxy75) and iap-3 (Lyxy116). Both iaps only have one
BIR domain and one RING domain in the predicted
amino acid sequences.
Baculovirus repeated ORFs (bro genes)

A striking feature of most lepidopteran and dipteran
NPVs sequenced to date and in some of the GVs is the
presence of one to 16 copies of bro genes. Typically bro
genes are highly conserved, repetitive and widely distributed amongst insect DNA viruses [58]. The function of
these genes is unclear, but they have been shown to
bind to DNA [59]. These genes have also been found to
be associated with the regions of viral genome rearrangement [60]. LyxyMNPV contains 14 bro genes, which

have been named bro-a to bro-n based on their order in
the genome (Fig. 1; Additional file 2). Most BROs contain a core sequence of 41 aa at the N-terminal half and
several different domains throughout the sequence. The
bro gene family has been divided into four groups based
on the similarity of those domains [14]. Six of the LyxyMNPV bro genes, including ly-bro-b (Lyxy29), -h
(Lyxy108), -j (Lyxy142), -k (Lyxy145), -l (Lyxy146) and
-n (Lyxy154) which are homologues of ld-bro-b, -j, -b,
-p, -n and -p, respectively, belong to group I, while three
bros [ly-bro-a (Lyxy28), -i (Lyxy109) and -m (Lyxy147)
which are homologues of ld-bro-a, -a and -o, respectively] belong to group II. Four of them, including lybro-c (Lyxy67), -d (Lyxy68), -e (Lyxy69), and -f (Lyxy70)
which are homologues of ld-bro-c, -c, -c and -d, respectively, belong to group III. Only one bro [ly-bro-g
(Lyxy71) which is homologues of ld-bro-g] belongs to
group IV. The homologues of ld-bro-f, -h, -i, -k, -l and
-m are not presented in LyxyMNPV genome. However,
in LyxyMNPV, all group III bro genes encode small
fragments of truncated protein (154 aa, 330 aa, 196 aa
and 249 aa). Ly-bro-c, ly-bro-d and ly-bro-e are homologous to different regions of ld-bro-c, but ly-bro-f is
homologous to the N-terminal portion of ld-bro-d.

Homologous regions (hrs)

A novel feature of many baculovirus genomes is the presence of homologous regions (hrs) located throughout
the genome [61]. A single hr comprises a palindrome
that is usually flanked by direct repeats and is closely
related to counterparts located elsewhere in the genome.
According to the transient replication assays, hrs may
play a role in the replication origins of NPVs and GVs
[62] and function as enhancers of RNA polymerase IImediated transcription of baculovirus early promoters in
NPVs [63]. It has been suggested that hrs can probably
substitute for each other. However, it was recently
shown that no single homologous repeat region is essential for DNA replication of AcMNPV [64].
The LyxyMNPV genome contains thirteen homologous repeat regions (hr1, hr2, hr3a, hr3b, hr3c, hr4, hr5,
hr6, hr7, hr8a, hr8b, hr8c and hr9) that include two to
seven palindrome repeats for a total of 48 repeats (Fig.
3a) and account for 7.3% of the genome. Of these hrs,
hr4 and hr6 are in the reverse direction compared to
other hrs in the LyxyMNPV genome (Fig. 3a). Similar to
the LdMNPV palindrome sequence [14], the LyxyMNPV
hr palindrome consensus GGCCGRCACGTAAAATTCTACGCGTCCGCC shows 24/30 palindrome matches

indicated below the line. AcMNPV hr2a is shown as in Possee & Rohrmann [84]. For consistency, all linearised genomes start with polh, but hrs
and ORF numbers remain as in the original papers. The numbers in brackets indicate the number of complete repeats in the hr palindromes. A
scale in kb is provided in the bottom of the figure

Figure 5 Detailed hr locations and gene organisation in the LyxyMNPV genomic fragment ranging from Lyxy106 to the hr1 region
relative to those of the LdMNPV genome. The number and transcriptional direction of each ORF are labelled by arrows indicating the
direction of transcription. Each pair of LyxyMNPV and LdMNPV homologue genes is labelled in a different pattern. ORF numbers are shown
below the arrows. The names of the putative genes are shown on the arrows. Grey rectangles indicate the locations and relative lengths of the
hrs.

(Fig. 3b) and the palindromic consensus sequence
includes five highly variable positions (Fig. 3b). All
nucleotides in the palindrome are >91.5% conserved,
except for the eighteenth nucleotide (81.3% conserved),
and with the variable nucleotides being 50%-77% conserved. In addition, the AcMNPV consensus hr palindrome has 50% sequence identity with LyxyMNPV
consensus hr sequence (Fig. 3b).
The genomic positions of LyxyMNPV regions hr1 hr5 are conserved with the genomic positions of
LdMNPV hr1 - hr5 [14]. LyxyMNPV hr1, hr3a, hr3c,
hr4 and hr5 are flanked by the same ORFs as those in
the LdMNPV genome (Fig. 4) and LyxyMNPV hr7, hr8b
and hr8c are flanked by the same ORFs as LdMNPV
hr6, hr7d and hr8, respectively (Fig. 5). Major insertions
and deletions were found near the LyxyMNPV hr2 and
hr3b. Therefore, LyxyMNPV hr2 is flanked by Lyxy6
(Ld7) and Lyxy7 (Ld9) and hr3b is flanked by Lyxy27
(Ld30) and Lyxy28 (Ld32) (ld-bro-a) (Fig. 4). Conversely,
LdMNPV hr7a, hr7b and hr7c are not present in the
corresponding locations in the LyxyMNPV (Fig. 5). As
reported in other comparisons of closely related viruses,
ORF content tends to differ markedly between LdMNPV
and LyxyMNPV around the hr6, hr8a and hr9. LyxyMNPV hr6 is located between Lyxy109 (Ld32) and
Lyxy110 (Ld145), hr8a is located between Lyxy145
(Ld161) and Lyxy146 (Ld153) and hr9 is located
between Lyxy154 (Ld161) and Lyxy155 (Ld18) (Fig. 5).
It is notable that in the region from Lyxy110 to
Lyxy142, between hr6 and hr7 showed a reverse gene

arrangement compared to those of LdMNPV (Fig. 2a;
Fig. 5).
The positions of at least some hrs appear to be conserved relative to specific baculovirus genes. In particular, it was found that an hr is conserved immediately
downstream of Ac83 and the homologous genes in
BmNPV [34], OpMNPV [23] and LdMNPV [14]. LyxyMNPV hr5 is located immediately downstream of
Lyxy87 (vp91/p95), the LyxyMNPV homologue of Ac83
(Fig. 4). In addition, similar to LdMNPV, because no
homologue of the AcMNPV ORFs (Ac84-Ac88) are present in the LyxyMNPV genome, Lyxy88 is located
immediately downstream of this hr, which is the homologue of AcMNPV vp39 (Ac89). This indicates that the
position of LyxyMNPV hr5 is conserved with regard to
both the upstream and downstream genes. The ORF
organisation downstream of this hr in OpMNPV,
BmNPV [34] and LdMNPV is similar to LyxyMNPV.
Homologues of Ac84-Ac86 are missing in BmNPV,
while Ac84 and Ac86 are missing in OpMNPV. Given
that hrs share higher similarity within a virus strain than
any hrs between species, this evidence further indicates
that hrs play a fundamental role in viral life cycle and
replication process appears to be tightly linked to functional conservation.
LyxyMNPV duplicate genes

Two pairs of genes, Lyxy45/Lyxy46 and Lyxy50/Lyxy51,
were identified as duplicated homologues of Ld49 and
Ld53 in the LyxyMNPV genome. All of these duplicate

trees at each node (NJ/MP). The location of LyxyMNPV is printed in bold.

genes show low identities to each other (20% and 6%).
However, Ly45/Ly46 has higher identity (38%) from
amino acid positions 51 to the 105, while Lyxy50/
Lyxy51 has higher identy (17%) from amino acid 60 to
the 126. Of these duplicate genes, Lyxy45 and Lyxy50
have low identities to Ld49 (17%) and Ld53 (45%),
respectively but Lyxy50 with the C-terminal portion
consisting of 81 amino acids has over 75% identity to
Ld53. However, both Lyxy46 and Lyxy51 are 13% identical to the homologues of LdMNPV.
Unique LyxyMNPV ORFs

Four genes are unique in the LyxyMNPV genome,
including Lyxy11, Lyxy19, Lyxy130 and Lyxy131 (Additional file 2). Most of these ORFs are small in size (55-83
aa), with the exception of Lyxy131 (689 aa). Only
Lyxy130 contain a recognisable promoter. Lyxy130 possesses a late gene promoter motif and an enhancer-like
element. Those ORFs with no recognisable promoter
may not be transcribed, but Lyxy130 may be transcribed
during the early or late stages of infection and could be
contributing factor in host range expansion and some
pathology of LyxyMNPV. Both Lyxy11 and Lyxy19 have
no baculovirus homologue and no significant BLAST
database hit. Lyxy130 and Lyxy131 however have at least
one significant BLAST database hit. Lyxy130 had a 32%
identity match to 20 aa of a hypothetical protein [GenBank: XP_567060] of the fungal species Cryptococcus
neoformans (the e-value is 25). Interestingly, Lyxy131 had

a 31% identity match to 62 aa of Drosophila melanogaster
GAG protein [GenBank: AAT12844] (the e-value is 5e25), which shows some homology, albeit low (10, 18 and
14%, respectively) to full length of D. melanogaster and
B. mori [GenBank: BAB21762], and it has also been identified in the highly repetitive elements (LDT1) of the
gypsy moth (L. dispar) [GenBank: AAC72920] [65]. In
retroviruses, the gag gene encodes structural proteins
and will be primarily translated as Gag precursor that
acts to generate structural proteins of the mature infectious virus. All retroviruses have at least three mature
Gag proteins that are generically referred to as matrix
(MA) protein, capsid (CA) protein, and nucleocapsid
(NC) protein [66]. However, as mentioned above, the gag
gene of LyxyMNPV has no recognizable promoter so it
may not be transcribed and therefore may not contribute
to the encapsidation of LyxyMNPV.
Phylogenetic analysis of LyxyMNPV

The neighbour-joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony
(MP) trees generated similar results, but the NJ tree
revealed higher bootstrap values. The results reflect the
current systematic assignment of the viruses. As shown
in Fig. 6, the family Baculoviridae consists of five major
clades: the NPVs infecting Lepidoptera (including group
I and group II), the GVs, the Hymenopteran-specific
NPVs and CuniNPV. Two subclades within the lepidopteran NPV group II resemble the LdMNPV and
AdhoNPV lineages as reported by Oliveira et al. [67].

Nai et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:116
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/116

The result indicated that LyxyMNPV and LdMNPV are
grouped together. These results correspond to our previous studies [12,16] and indicate that LyxyMNPV is a
baculovirus distinct from LdMNPV but the two are closely related based on the pairwise distances of the
nucleotide sequences of polh, lef-8 and lef-9 [12].
Comparison of LyxyMNPV to LdMNPV

The most significant difference between LyxyMNPV and
LdMNPV is a large genomic fragment (29.3 kb in
length) of LyxyMNPV that includes 32 ORFs and one
hr, which range from Lyxy110 (Ld145) to Lyxy141
(Ld116) and are inverted compared to those of
LdMNPV (Fig. 2a; Fig. 5). The LyxyMNPV genome is
4702 bp smaller than the LdMNPV genome and contains six fewer ORFs. LyxyMNPV contains six ORFs
that are absent in LdMNPV (Table 1), whereas
LdMNPV contains 22 ORFs that are absent in LyxyMNPV, namely rr1, rr2a, and ctl-1, as mentioned previously (see Additional file 3). LyxyMNPV and
LdMNPV share 14 ORFs (Lyxy7, Lyxy8, Lyxy9, Lyxy22,
Lyxy25, Lyxy30, Lyxy45, Lyxy46, Lyxy65, Lyxy73,
Lyxy124, Lyxy136, Lyxy144 and Lyxy157) with unknown
functions, and the homologues of these genes are not
present in the other baculoviruses. These shared genes
range from 50 to 370 aa in LyxyMNPV, and 10 of them
contain recognisable promoters. It is possible that these
genes are host range genes that are involved specifically
in LyxyMNPV or other NPV infection in LD cells or
other Lymantria species. There are 151 ORFs in common between LyxyMNPV and LdMNPV, and their
order is mostly identical. Several of these ORFs are of
different lengths, as shown in Additional file 4. These
genes include p74, dbp1, bro-c to -f, bro-m, vp91/p95,
vp80, egt, pif-2, arif-1 and odv-e27 as well as other genes
of unassigned functions. The hrs of LyxyMNPV are not
all in the same position and contain different numbers
and orientations of repeat units compared to LdMNPV.
The differences in gene content, ORF length and hr are
possible candidates for regulators of the different degree
of virulence exhibited by the two similar species [68],
and it might be the same case between LyxyMNPV and
LdMNPV, and even LdMNPV-like virus.
There are three Lymantriidae-derived NPV species,
including LyxyMNPV, LdMNPV and OpMNPV, which
have a common in vitro host cell, the LD cell line
[16,17,19,23]. Comparing further the LyxyMNPV gene
content to those of LdMNPV and OpMNPV, we found
that these three NPVs shared 99 ORFs (Additional file 2);
three of these genes were absent in the AcMNPV genome,
namely Lyxy116/Op35/Ld139 (iap-3), Lyxy137/Op34/
Ld120 (rr2b), and Lyxy141/Op31/Ld116 (dutpase). Of
these three genes, iap-3 is one of the baculovirus genes
that affect the viral host range and prevent apoptosis in

Page 11 of 14

baculovirus-infected cells [54]. In OpMNPV, op-iap3
could rescue AcMNPV mutants lacking p35 from induced
LD cell apoptosis [56]. Silencing of op-iap3 during the
OpMNPV infection of LD cells induces apoptosis [69].
These data support a possibly important role for iap-3
during the early stage of baculovirus infection in LD cells.
However, LdMNPV and OpMNPV have 22 and 55
genes, respectively, with no homologues in the LyxyMNPV genome. Among them, an important gene, hrf1 (Ld67 and Op143), that is involved in baculoviral host
range and infectivity was not found in the LyxyMNPV
genome (Table 1). Studies on hrf-1 revealed that it
could promote NPV infectivity (including SeMNPV,
HycuNPV, BmNPV, and AcMNPV) of LD cells [69],
and recombinant AcMNPV bearing hrf-1 also exhibited
increased infectivity towards Helicoverpa zea and L. dispar larvae [70,71]. A new NPV species, MaviMNPV,
which also lacks the hrf-1 gene, could infect LD cells
with a low infection rate (<1%) by its egfp-recombinant
virus, but it could not infect LY cells [24].
Baculovirus host range likely involves a complicated
array of viral and cellular factors. However, through
data from genomic analyses, we speculate that hrf-1
maybe more important for group-I NPVs during infection in LD cells than group-II NPVs. In addition, iap-3
from LyxyMNPV, LdMNPV and OpMNPV may be an
important factor during NPV infection in LD cells.

Conclusion
In conclusion, LyxyMNPV showed a high degree of colinearity and sequence identity with LdMNPV. However,
these two viruses came from different geographical locations. The results of our previous studies and previous
in vitro infection assay revealed that LyxyMNPV could
be propagated in both LY and LD cell lines. Furthermore, the genome sequence analysis revealed that LyxyMNPV lacks hrf-1. Thus, the genes that are involved in
the host range expansion of LyxyMNPV and LdMNPV
are very interesting and worth further study. LyxyMNPV
was highly virulent to L. xylina larvae, which suggests
that it could be a promising agent for inclusion in I.P.
M. programs for the biological control of L. xylina in
Taiwan.
Methods
Insect cell lines, virus and viral DNA

Wild-type LyxyMNPV was isolated from infected larvae
in Taiwan [16,17], and a LyxyMNPV clone (Ly-5) was
isolated using the L. xylina cell line [NTU-LY-1 cells
(LY) [18]] and used in this study. Viral occlusion bodies
(OBs) and viral DNA were determined and prepared following the protocol described by Summers & Smith
[72]. The quantity and quality of extracted DNA were
determined
spectrophotometrically
and
by

Nai et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:116

electrophoresis in 1% agarose. LY cell line was cultured
in TNM-FH medium [73] at 28°C. The medium contained 8% foetal bovine serum (FBS) supplemented with
50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1.25
μg/ml fungizone.
Nucleotide sequence determination

The LyxyMNPV genome was sequenced to six-fold coverage by a shotgun approach. The viral DNA was
sheared by hydrodynamic shearing forces into fragments
with an average size of 2000 bp (HybroShear; GeneMachines). DNA fragments were size fractionated by gel
electrophoresis and cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II SK (-) (Stratagene). The cloned plasmids were
transformed into Escherichia coli BH10B (Invitrogen)
and the recombinant bacterial colonies were grown on
LB agar containing ampicillin, X-gal and IPTG. The
DNA templates were prepared using the 96-well plasmid
preparation method and the sequencing was performed
by using KS/SK primer set (Stratagene) and ABI 3730
DNA analyser (Applied Biosystems), and the data was
compiled into contigs using the PHRED/PHRAP software package [74,75]. The assembled sequences were
then edited and completed using the Sun workstation
interface [76].
DNA sequence analysis

Open reading frames (ORFs) were identified using
GeneWorks software (IntelliGenetics, Inc.) and ORF
Finder http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html[77].
The criterion for defining an ORF was a size of at least
150 nt (50 aa) with minimal overlap. Promoter motifs
present upstream of the putative ORFs were screened.
To screen the early promoter motifs, the conserved pattern is a TATA-box motif with a cap-site CAKT of 2030 bp located downstream within 180 bp of the initiation codon [28,78] and DTAAG within 120 bp of the
initiation codon is a conserved motif of the late promoter motif [28,29]. In addition, the genome was checked
in detail for the presence of any ORFs identified for
AcMNPV [22], MaviMNPV [24], LdMNPV [14],
SeMNPV [30] and CpGV [31] in GenBank. Homology
searches were done through the National Centre for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website using BLAST
[79]. Multiple alignments and percentage identities of all
LyxyMNPV ORFs with their homologues in selected
genomes were generated using CLUSTAL_X [80]. The
Tandem Repeats Finder http://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.
html[81] was used to locate and analyse the homologous
regions (hrs). GeneParityPlot analysis was performed on
the LyxyMNPV genome versus the genomes of
AcMNPV [22], MaviMNPV [24], LdMNPV [14],
SeMNPV [30] and CpGV [31] as described previously

Page 12 of 14

[82] and AcMNPV were renumbered manually, starting
with the polh gene as number one.
Phylogenetic analysis

The phylogenetic tree was inferred from a data set of
combined amino acid sequences of the 29 baculovirus
core genes [22,6] of the 46 baculoviruses that were completely sequenced at the time of analysis (Additional file
1). NJ and MP analyses were performed using MEGA,
version 4.0 [83]. Culex nigripalpus NPV (CuniNPV) was
selected as the out-group. Bootstrap analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the phylogenies
using 1000 replicates for both NJ and MP analyses.
