Abstract
Background: The origin of nuclear receptors (NRs) and the question whether the ancestral NR was a
liganded or an unliganded transcription factor has been recently debated. To obtain insight into the
evolution of the ligand binding ability of estrogen receptors (ER), we comparatively characterized the ER
from the protochordate amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae), and the ER from lamprey (Petromyzon
marinus), a basal vertebrate.
Results: Extensive phylogenetic studies as well as signature analysis allowed us to confirm that the
amphioxus ER (amphiER) and the lamprey ER (lampER) belong to the ER group. LampER behaves as a
"classical" vertebrate ER, as it binds to specific DNA Estrogen Responsive Elements (EREs), and is activated
by estradiol (E2), the classical ER natural ligand. In contrast, we found that although amphiER binds EREs,
it is unable to bind E2 and to activate transcription in response to E2. Among the 7 natural and synthetic
ER ligands tested as well as a large repertoire of 14 cholesterol derivatives, only Bisphenol A (an endocrine
disruptor with estrogenic activity) bound to amphiER, suggesting that a ligand binding pocket exists within
the receptor. Parsimony analysis considering all available ER sequences suggest that the ancestral ER was
not able to bind E2 and that this ability evolved specifically in the vertebrate lineage. This result does not
support a previous analysis based on ancestral sequence reconstruction that proposed the ancestral
steroid receptor to bind estradiol. We show that biased taxonomic sampling can alter the calculation of
ancestral sequence and that the previous result might stem from a high proportion of vertebrate ERs in
the dataset used to compute the ancestral sequence.
Conclusion: Taken together, our results highlight the importance of comparative experimental
approaches vs ancestral reconstructions for the evolutionary study of endocrine systems: comparative
analysis of extant ERs suggests that the ancestral ER did not bind estradiol and that it gained the ability to
be regulated by estradiol specifically in the vertebrate lineage, before lamprey split.

Background
Hormone signaling is a very important feature in metazoans, allowing communication between cells or organs
within the organism. Two components of these signaling
systems are of particular importance, the hormone and its
receptor. The nuclear hormone receptor (NR) superfamily
includes ligand dependent transcription factors that play
a central role in various physiological processes as diverse
as reproduction, development, and control of homeostasis [1,2]. They share a common structural organization
and exhibit a highly conserved DNA binding domain
(DBD) and a moderately conserved ligand-binding
domain (LBD). Some members of this superfamily are liganded receptors (24 among the 48 genes encoding NRs in
the human genome) but many lack identified ligand and
are therefore called "orphan" [3]. Some orphan receptors
are 'true' orphans in the sense that they do not possess a
bona fide ligand-binding pocket (LBP), like the members
of the NR4 subfamily (for instance, NURR1, DHR38 or
NGFI-B. For review, see [4]), and are regulated by other
mechanisms [4]. Alternatively, the crystal structures of
several orphan receptors such as HNF4 were found to
have a phospholipid constitutively bound to a large ligand binding pocket [5,6]. The functional and evolutionary implications of these constitutive ligands remain
discussed. Other orphan nuclear receptors have a ligand
binding pocket and thus have the potential to bind compounds. It is still not known whether those receptors have
natural ligands, still to be discovered. Undoubtedly, the
existence of such orphan receptors with physiological or
developmental activities constitutes both a major challenge for understanding nuclear receptor evolution and a
potential opportunity for pharmacology [1].
The existence of orphan and liganded members in the NR
family raises the question of the evolution regarding their
ligand binding ability. Whether the ancestral NR was liganded or orphan and more generally how NR ligand binding ability evolved has been recently debated [7-14]. In
general, it is still unclear if there is a correlation between
the evolution of the hormone repertoire and NRs. Moreover the mechanisms underlying this coevolution are of
particular interest [7,12,15-19].
Among the scenarios of NR evolution that have been proposed, one suggests that the ancestral NR was a ligandindependent transcription factor which acquired the ability to be regulated by ligands several times during evolution [7,18-20]. This hypothesis was based on the
observation that compounds of similar chemical nature
bind to divergent NRs and on the contrary compounds of
very different nature bind to closely related receptors. For
instance, orphan receptors are found in all families of
NRs, and steroid receptors are not monophyletic but are
located in two different subfamilies within the NR super-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/219

family: the ecdysteroid as well as the sex steroid receptors.
Interestingly, the evolution of sex steroid hormone receptors has also been used as an argument for an alternative
hypothesis, the ligand exploitation model [8,11] (for an
alternative view, see [21,22]). Phylogenetic trees show
that sex steroid hormone receptors are grouped with ERRs
as the NR3 subfamily, following the official nomenclature
[23]. They contain receptors that bind estradiol (ERs), that
form the NR3A group as well as mineralocorticoids
(MRs), glucocorticoids (GRs), progesterone (PRs), and
androgen (ARs) that form the NR3C group. All known ligands in this subfamily can be seen as variations around
the archetypical sterol skeleton. Consequently, Thornton
et al. suggested in the ligand exploitation model that the
ancestral steroid receptor was a high affinity estradiol
receptor [8,11] and the other steroid receptors that originated later on, experienced, following gene duplication,
shifts in their binding affinities to eventually bind to their
extant ligand. The model in fact suggests that the newly
duplicated receptors (here NR3C) exploit as ligands
chemical species that serve as intermediary compounds in
the "ancestral ligand" synthesis pathway (here the estradiol synthesis pathway) [8]. According to this view,
orphan receptors, like ERRs, secondarily lost the ability to
have their activity regulated by a ligand and became
orphan. Interestingly, within the NR3 family, two receptor
subfamilies, ERRs and ERs, appear to be ancient since they
are found in a wide variety of metazoans including deuterostomes and protostomes, whereas, up to now, MRs, GRs,
PRs and ARs have been found only in vertebrates. The
only non-vertebrate ERs that have been described so far
were from mollusks and were shown to be unable to bind
estradiol [11,12,24-26]. Since the ligand exploitation
model implies an ancestral estradiol-binding ER and since
all liganded ER found so far come from vertebrates, and to
improve taxonomic sampling, the ER orthologues from
the basal vertebrate lamprey and the invertebrate chordate
amphioxus were characterized here. Indeed, lamprey and
amphioxus are located at key positions in the chordate
phylum [27-30]. Moreover, amphioxus (Brachiostoma floridae) is much less derived than urochordates in its morphology as well as in its genome organization [30].
Indeed, amphioxus and vertebrates share a similar general
body plan whereas urochordate morphology is more
derived. For instance, during metamorphosis of some urochordates, the tadpole-like larva transforms into an adult
that looks so different that it was first considered as a mollusk [31]. Moreover the urochordate genome is fast evolving [27], with for instance the loss of the clustering of the
hox genes [32]. There is no ER in the sequenced genome
of Ciona intestinalis [33] or in the sea urchin [34], one ER
was previously cloned in lamprey [8], only one ER was
found in the amphioxus genome [35]. These reasons
make lamprey and amphioxus excellent models to study
the evolution of estrogen signaling pathway at the origin

of vertebrates. In this study, we cloned the unique ER from
amphioxus (amphiER) and characterized it, as well as the
previously cloned but uncharacterized lamprey ER (lampER). AmphiER is an orphan receptor, showing no affinity
to the estrogen hormone estradiol, when in contrast, the
lamprey ER behaves as a "classical" vertebrate ER. As no
ER from invertebrates studied so far binds estradiol, we
propose that the ancestral ER (and the ancestral steroid
receptor) was not a receptor for estradiol and gained later
on during evolution the ability to bind the hormone.

Results
Cloning of the ER from amphioxus (amphiER)
Using degenerate primers designed to match motifs in the
most conserved part of vertebrate ERs in the DNA binding
domain, a single gene fragment from total RNA of an
adult Branchiostoma floridae was amplified, cloned and
sequenced. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)
was utilized to obtain the full-length cDNA. From this
sequence, a new set of specific primers were designed and
used to amplify the full length open reading frame of this
gene. The obtained cDNA [GenBank: ACF16007] is 2118
bp long and encodes a 705 aa long putative protein (Figure 1) that harbors the classical features of an ER with the
5 main functional domains (Figure 2A), among which a
highly conserved DNA binding domain (DBD) and a less
conserved ligand binding domain (LBD). The DBD shares
an 82% sequence identity with the human ERα one (83%
with human ERβ) and much less with the other NR3
receptors (<62%). The same pattern is observed for the
LBD, although this domain is less conserved since it
exhibits only 34% amino acid identity with human ERα
(35% for human ERβ) and about 20% with other steroid
receptors (Figure 2A). The three other domains, namely
the A/B region in the N-terminal part, the hinge between
DBD and LBD, and the short C-terminal end of the protein, are more divergent, which is a general pattern for
NRs [2] (Figure 2A). The recent release of the amphioxus
genome confirmed the presence of a single ER gene [35].
In contrast the previously described lamprey ER is more
similar to the human ERα with its DBD sharing a 93%
sequence identity (93% for human ERβ) and its LBD sharing 55% sequence identity (56% for human ERβ) [8].
Phylogenetic analysis of ERs
The orthology relationships of the amphioxus and lamprey ER sequences were studied in a phylogenetic analysis
of the NR3 family using an exhaustive dataset comprising
69 members of the NR3 subfamily as well as sequences of
RXRs as an outgroup. The dataset included the 6 currently
known mollusk ER sequences (from Nucella lapillus,
Crassostrea gigas, Marisa cornuarietis, Thais clavigera, Octopus vulgaris, Aplysia californica), as well as the 2 NR3
sequences previously known from amphioxus (1 ERR
[GenBank: AAU88062] and 1 NR3C [JGI: 201600],

retrieved from a previous work [36] or from the complete
genome sequence [35]). In the resulting phylogenetic tree,
the sequence of lamprey ER branches within the ER clade
with a high bootstrap support (95%), at the expected
position before the split of vertebrate ERα and ERβ (Figure
2B, and for a tree presenting all sequences, see Additional
file 1A), as previously shown [8]. The sequence of amphiER branches within the ERs and is located at the base of
the vertebrate estrogen receptor group, before the split of
ERα and ERβ but after the split of the mollusk ERs (bootstrap value of 81%, Figure 2B). However its precise position within the ER group is poorly supported (bootstrap
value of 42%).
Such low bootstrap supports reveal either the weakness of
the phylogenetic signal contained in ER proteins, or the
presence of two incompatible signals in the data, one supporting the observed position of amphiER within ERs,
and the other supporting another position. Whereas the
weakness of the signal is not testable, the long branch
leading to amphiER in the tree suggests that sites that have
undergone a large number of substitutions may account
for one of the two signals. Such sites may be saturated to
the point that phylogenetic methods are not able to correctly recover their evolution, a situation leading to the
long branch attraction artifact [37]. It is therefore important to correctly characterize sites that support the ER position of amphiER: if only fast-evolving sites support this
hypothesis, it is probably due to long branch attraction,
and an alternative branching should be favored. Alternatively, if slowly-evolving sites support this position, one
can confidently identify amphiER as a bona fide ER. To
characterize sites with respect to their evolutionary rates
and the amphiER position they favor, both site likelihoods and site evolutionary rates were computed for all
possible positions of amphiER.
First, AmphiER was pruned from the tree shown in Figure
2B, and then re-grafted in all 149 remaining branches.
This yielded 149 topologies, for which site likelihoods
and site evolutionary rates could be computed using
PhyML-aLRT. This allowed us to obtain an evolutionary
rate per site averaged over all possible positions of amphiER, and therefore independent from the precise position
of amphiER in the tree. Additionally, as likelihoods were
computed for each of the 149 positions, these positions
could be compared according to the Approximately Unbiased test (AU test, implemented in Consel [38]). Out of all
the 149 resulting trees, 26 could not be distinguished with
the AU test and had a likelihood significantly better than
all the other ones (p-value > 0,05). Of these 26 topologies,
all but three place amphiER within the ER clade ("ER"
trees). The remaining topologies ("alter-ER" trees) place
amphiER either at the base of the NR3C clade (comprising
the ARs, PRs, MRs and GRs), within the NR3C or at the

Sequence alignment of several ERs including the amphioxus ER and the lamprey ER, as well as ancestral steroid receptors
Sequence alignment of several ERs including the amphioxus ER and the lamprey ER, as well as ancestral steroid receptors. The DBD is highlighted with light grey. The 12 helices from the LBD are indicated, based on the known 3D
structure of human ERα [49]. Amino acids from human ERα making direct hydrogen bonds with E2 are indicated in green.
Amino acids making hydrophobic bonds with E2 are highlighted in purple. Amino acids known to be involved in co-activator
interaction have been indicated with a star on top of each site [55]. The more divergent A/B domain as well as the F domain
have been omitted from the alignment. However, the numbering of the sites along the alignment starts at the beginning of each
protein. The exon-intron limits of amphiER and humanERα have been indicated with small red strokes. The sequences of AncSRa and AncSRb have been inferred in this study. The sequence of AncSR1 was retrieved from a previous analysis [11].

for the "alter-ER" trees could be compared with sites favoring the "ER" topologies with respect to their evolutionary
rates. Interestingly, the sites pleading for the "alter-ER"
trees evolve significantly faster than the sites pleading for
the "ER" trees (mean evolutionary rates of 1.20 and 0.90,
p-value < 10-5 with a Wilcoxon-test or p < 0.001 with a an
unpaired t-test). This suggests that the "alter-ER" signal in
the alignment is probably due to long branch attraction to
the NR3C subtree, which might also be at the origin of the
low bootstrap support (42%) for the position of amphiER. Conversely, this suggests that amphiER should be
considered as an ER, as the signal at the origin of this position does not seem to be artifactual.

base of (ER, NR3C) (Figure 3A). Because site evolutionary
rates had been computed, sites having a higher likelihood

An additional test can be run to further confirm this
hypothesis, and consists in reestimating the phylogeny
using only slowly-evolving sites. For that purpose, the distribution of expected relative evolutionary rates across
sites of the alignment was plotted, as found by phymlaLRT [39,40] (Figure 3B). Fastest-evolving sites were
removed from the dataset based on three different rate
thresholds (2.5, 2 or 1.5, Figure 3B and 3C), and trees
were reconstructed based on the alignments containing
only the remaining slowly-evolving sites. These operations did not impact the monophyly of ERs (Figure 3C) or
the statistical support. This shows that the clustering of
amphiER with vertebrate ERs does not come from saturated sites, which argues against long branch attraction
being at the origin of this position [41]. Accordingly, complementary phylogenetic analyses with different methods
(bayesian, Neighbor-joining, parsimony) gave similar
results (see Additional file 1). From these studies we conclude that amphiER does indeed belong to the ER subfamily, which is confirmed by the general conservation of
the exon-intron structure of amphiER with human ERα,
especially at two exon-intron splice sites in the DBD and
in the LBD after helix 3 (Figure 2C and short red strokes in
Figure 1) [42].
Chordate ERs, including amphioxus ER and lamprey ER,
are able to bind estrogen specific response elements (ERE)
To test whether the lamprey ER and the amphioxus ER are
able to bind DNA on specific estrogen response elements
(EREs), electrophoresis mobility shift assays were performed using a radiolabeled consensus ERE sequence (see
Additional file 2). These experiments show that, like vertebrate ERs, amphiER and lampER are able to bind DNA
specifically on a consensus ERE. This binding is specific,
since a 100-fold excess of non-specific DNA was not able
to compete for binding, whereas a 100-fold excess of cold
ERE completely suppressed it (see Additional file 2, compare lanes 15 and 17, as well as lanes 19 and 21). ERs contain two major conserved signatures in the DBD, the Pbox (CEGCKA), responsible for the binding specificity to
response elements, and the D-box, also involved in the

Phylogenetic analysis of amphiER
Phylogenetic analysis of amphiER. (A) Summary of the 26 best placements of amphiER within a phylogenetic tree comprised of 69 NR3 and 8 RXR sequences. 23/26 topologies ("ER-tree") place amphiER within the ER clade, the 3 remaining
topologies ("alter-ER tree") place amphiER either at the base of (ER, NR3C) or within the NR3C family (close to an AR) or at
the base of the NR3 family. The mean evolutionary rate of the sites supporting one of the 23 "ER-tree" topologies (0,9) or for
the "alter-ER tree" topologies (1,2) are indicated in (B). (B) Distribution of the site relative evolutionary rates. Rates were estimated using an 8 class discretized gamma distribution. The vertical dotted lines correspond to different tentative threshold
(2.5, 2, 1.5), above which sites have been discarded due to their high evolutionary rate, before reestimating the phylogeny of
the consecutive alignment. (C) Estimation of the minimum of Chi2-based and SH-like supports, available in the aLRT-PHYML
software, for the branches defining the monophyly of ERs as well as the position of amphiER. 4 trees were inferred using an
alignment on which the fastest evolving sites were removed (no site removed, 34, 53 and 82 sites removed out of 323, with a
mean evolutionary rate threshold above 2.5, 2.0 and 1.5, respectively).

DNA binding specificity of the ER dimers (Figure 2A). The
P-box is highly conserved in all known ERs, including
amphiER and lamprey ER and is different from other NR3
members. AmphiER and lamprey ER also have a well conserved D-box, amphiER D-box containing just a few conservative mutations, (e.g. a mutation of an alanine in
glycine, Figure 2A). Since the three characterized mollusk
ERs (from A. californica, O. vulgaris and Thais clavigera
[11,12,24]) also bind EREs and since the P-box and D-box
are well conserved in all known ERs, including those from

mollusks, ERE binding appears to be a feature specific to
all ERs.
Lamprey ER, but not amphioxus ER, is able to induce
transactivation of a reporter gene in response to estradiol
stimulation
The transactivation ability of lamprey ER and amphiER
was then compared with that of human ERα. AmphiER
failed to induce transcription of a reporter construct containing a consensus ERE in front of a minimal promoter

in transfected mammalian cells after stimulation by the
natural vertebrate ER ligand, estradiol (E2) as well as a
wide variety of other vertebrate ER ligands (the natural
agonist 3β-androstenediol [43], and the phytoestrogens
resveratrol [44] and enterolactone [45]) (Figure 4A and
4B). In order to improve the detection sensitivity, was also
tested the transactivation capacity of amphiER in response
to E2 as a construct containing only the LBD fused to the
GAL4 DNA-binding domain. In this case again, no activation was detected (Figure 4C). In agreement with this
result, no recruitment of the coactivator SRC1 (an homologue of which is present in the amphioxus genome, see

A

Discussion) was detected in mammalian two-hybrid assay
(Figure 4D). However lampER is activated by E2, with an
intensity comparable to humanERα (Figure 4C), which
suggests that the lamprey ER is a high affinity E2-dependant transcription factor.
Since amphiER is able to bind DNA but is unable to activate transcription of a reporter gene, the dominant negative capacity of the amphioxus protein was tested. A dosedependent decrease in the reporter gene activity was
clearly visible in 2 different cell lines when increasing
amounts of the amphiER plasmid were added together

LampER is an estradiol receptor whereas amphiER is not
able to bind ER ligands except the synthetic compound
Bisphenol A
In order to confirm that lamprey ER is an E2 receptor and
to better understand the molecular basis behind the inability of the amphiER to become transcriptionally activated by estradiol stimulation, E2 binding by lamprey ER
and amphiER was tested in vitro. For that purpose, limited
proteolysis assay allows to assess whether addition of different putative ligands can induce a conformational
change in amphiER [13]. Using this method the ligand
induced conformational change of the LBD is revealed by
the alteration of the receptor sensitivity toward proteolytic
digestion by trypsin. As expected, E2 was able to protect
human ERα from proteolysis (Figure 6A). Interestingly
lamprey ER was also protected from proteolysis by E2 even
at the lowest concentration tested (Figure 6A), thus confirming the results of the transactivation assays that the
lamprey ER is a high affinity E2 receptor. In contrast no
protection of amphiER by estradiol was observed, even at
very high ligand concentrations (10-3M) (Figure 6A).
Since estradiol does not protect amphiER from proteolysis, several other classical ER ligands were tested, such as
the synthetic ER agonists diethylstilbestrol [46], 4hydroxy-tamoxifene [46] or bisphenol A (BPA) [47], the
natural agonist 3β-androstenediol [43], the phytoestrogen enterolactone [45] or the synthetic ER antagonist ICI182780 [46]. All compounds were able to bind to human
ERα (Figure 6B to 6G) as expected, whereas none but BPA
was able to bind to amphiER (Figure 6G). However, BPA
did not induce transactivation by amphiER in mammalian cells reporter assay, and did not induce recruitment of
the coactivator SRC1 either (see Additional file 4).

with constant amounts of human ERα or ERβ in transient
transfection experiments. This decrease was observed
both with synthetic consensus EREs (Figures 5A and 5B.
See also Additional file 3) and with the natural ERE
present in the classical ER pS2 target gene (Figure 5C).
Apparently, amphiER is able to compete with human ERα
or ERβ for binding to the ERE sites present in the reporter
constructs, and in doing so, prevents ERα and ERβ from
inducing transcription, which results in a decrease in
reporter gene activity. Thus, in contrast to Aplysia, Octopus
or Thais ER [11,12,24], amphiER does not display constitutive transcriptional activity under our experimental conditions and rather exhibits an inhibitory effect (Figure 4).
This clearly shows that the absence of transcriptional
activity observed here is not an artifact linked to a poor
expression of the construct but rather reflects the inability
of amphiER to activate transcription in mammalian cells.

their ability to bind and activate amphiER. None of the
tested compounds, even at high doses, had any effect on
amphiER transcription activity (see Additional file 5A).
Accordingly, no recruitment of the coactivator SRC1 by
amphiER was detected in mammalian two hybrid assays
(See Additional file 5B). The most probable explanation is
thus the lack of binding by those compounds to amphiER
(See Additional file 6).
Taken together these results show that the ER from lamprey behaves as a "classical" ER since it binds DNA on a
classical ERE and is activated by binding E2. On the other
hand, though the single ER from amphioxus is able to
bind the ERE, it does not bind any tested ER ligand and
cholesterol derivative, except bisphenol A. However, no
transcriptional activity was detected upon stimulation by
any of the tested ligands. Since none of the mollusk ERs

sequenced up to now binds E2 either, our data suggest that
E2-binding by ER is restricted to vertebrates, implying that
vertebrates specifically gained the ability to be regulated
by E2 (see Discussion).
Ancestral reconstruction of steroid receptors
In previous analyses that discussed the evolution of ERs, it
was argued that estradiol binding was an ancient function
of all sex steroid receptors (SRs, comprised of ERs and
NR3C members) and that the binding to other steroids
was more recent, with estradiol binding ability getting
restricted to ERs [8,11]. Those conclusions were based on
the reconstruction of the ancestral SR sequence [11]. Since
the finding that estradiol binding is not shared by all ERs
but restricted to vertebrate ERs contradicts this hypothesis,
and to get better insight into this apparent contradiction,
the sequence of the ancestral steroid receptor was reesti-

mated. When the ancestor (AncSR1) was first "resurrected", only one non-vertebrate sequence was available
[8,11]. The impact of more non-vertebrate sequences
(including amphiER) was thus tested on the reconstruction of the ancestor of steroid receptors. The sequence of
the ancestral steroid receptor (AncSRa), at the node
grouping ERs and NR3C, was inferred using PAML 4 [48],
from the alignment described previously (the study was
restricted to DBD and LBD) and the topology shown in
Figure 2B. The predicted sequence resembles AncSR1 (Figure 1) with 12 out of 18 amino acids involved in ligand
binding [49] being ER-like (Figure 1). However, important differences were noticed between AncSR1 and AncSRa. First one of the 3 amino acids making direct contacts
with E2 is different in AncSR1 and AncSRa: at this position, AncSR1 is vertebrate-ER like (a His residue is present
at position 524 of humanERα, located in helix H10–H11,
in green in the alignment, Figure 1) whereas the amino
acid is different in AncSRa and is mollusk-ER like (Tyr
instead of His) and mutations at this site have been
shown to impair ERα activity in human [50,51]. Second,
when a phylogenetic tree is built including both ancestral
sequences AncSR1 and AncSRa as well as various NR3
sequences, AncSRa branches deep in steroid receptors as
expected since it was built on the same dataset (Figure 7.
For a complete tree presenting all leaves, see Additional

The reconstruction ofto taxonomic sampling of steroid
The reconstruction of the ancestral sequence of steroid receptors is sensitive to taxonomic sampling. The
ancestral sequence of ER and NR3C was inferred using either
a complete dataset (AncSRa) or a partial dataset (AncSRb)
where 5 mollusk ER sequences as well as amphiER and
amphiNR3C were omitted. The position of those sequences
within the phylogenetic tree calculated with the complete
dataset was compared. The position of a previously
described ancestor (AncSR1) is indicated as well. Triangles

file 7) but AncSR1 branches close to the vertebrate ERs,
which is surprising. In order to determine whether the taxonomic sampling, and not details of the alignment, was
responsible for these differences, we calculated a second
SR ancestral sequence (AncSRb) using a smaller dataset:
taxon sampling was reduced by removing most of the
non-vertebrate steroid receptor sequences from the alignment (the amphioxus ER, the amphioxus NR3C as well as
5 out of the 6 mollusk ER sequences were removed to
obtain a dataset closer to the one used in [8]). In this case,
AncSRb branches next to AncSR1, closer to the ER clade
than to AncSRa (Figure 7). This result clearly shows that
the reconstruction of ancestral sequences is influenced by
the set of sequences available and that restricted taxonomic sampling biases ancestral SR sequences towards
vertebrate ER sequences. Therefore conclusions based on
such an analysis (specifically that the ancestral ER was
able to bind estradiol) should be considered as only tentative, since taxonomic sampling of available steroid
sequences is very much vertebrate-centered. Overall, taken
together, our data do no support the hypothesis that the
ancestral steroid receptor was an estradiol receptor.

Discussion
The amphioxus ER does not bind estradiol
In this paper we cloned and functionally characterized the
lamprey and amphioxus orthologues of the human estrogen receptors. Our results show that lampER binds estradiol whereas amphiER does not. We propose that 3 types
of ERs can be distinguished, depending on their ligand
binding properties: vertebrate ERs (including lamprey)
are the only bona fide estradiol receptors, mollusk ERs do
not bind estradiol and are constitutively active transcription factors and amphiER does not bind estradiol and is
transcriptionally silent in mammalian cells. This is supported by two points: (i) the experimental approach
developed here is biologically relevant since the binding
of bisphenol A (BPA) to amphiER was observed using the
same experimental conditions as for E2 suggesting that
amphiER is correctly folded and that a ligand binding
pocket is likely to be present. (ii) One of the three key
amino acid positions within the LBP of amphiER (Cys
531, located between the helixes H5 and H6, in green in
Figure 1) diverges from vertebrate ERs (Arg 394 in human
ERα), whilst the two other key positions (Glu 490 and His
659 in amphiER, located in helix H3 and H10–H11
respectively, in green in Figure 1) are conserved with the
vertebrate ERs (amino acids corresponding to Glu 353
and His 524 in human ERα), suggesting that potential
contacts between amphiER and estradiol are impaired.
Accordingly, a recent in silico study of amphiER ligand
binding ability confirmed an "unusual ligand recognition
in amphioxus ER" [52].

It was unexpected that no effect of the synthetic ER agonist
BPA was detected in the transactivation assay of the recepPage 10 of 20

tor in mammalian cells since BPA induces a conformational change of amphiER. This apparent absence of
coactivator recruitment (see Additional file 4B) resulting
in no transcriptional activity in response to BPA can be
interpreted in several ways: (i) because of the different
geometry of the ligand-binding pocket in amphiER, BPA
behaves as an antiestrogen (partial agonist or even a partial antagonist) and blocks the transcriptional activation
properties of amphiER, for instance by inducing a conformational change that does not allow coactivator recruitment (like human ERα and 4-raloxifen, [53]) or by
excluding amphiER from nucleus (like ICI-182,780 with
human ERα, [54]). (ii) Alternatively, the coactivator interface of amphiER does not fit with mammalian coactivators, resulting in artifactual loss of activation. However,
the conservation of the amino acids involved in co-activator interaction, compared to human ERα does not support
this hypothesis (sites indicated with a star in Figure 1, as
described in [55]). Among the divergent sites, at a position implicated in the charge clamp necessary for coactivator contact, amphiER contains an aspartate (D677)
instead of a glutamate in humanERα (E542). Importantly,
the divergence (E->D) is conservative and preserves the
negative charge of the amino acid, which is important for
interaction with the lysine from helix 3 (conserved in
amphiER) to form this charge clamp [56]. In addition, a
unique orthologue of the p160 family of coactivators was
found in the amphioxus genome [35] and its overall conservation with its 3 human ohnologues (genes that have
been duplicated during the two rounds of whole genome
duplications in the chordate lineage [57]) is good. (iii)
Interaction between mammalian chaperones like HSP90
and amphiER is impaired, leading to improper binding to
the hormone [58]. Taking these results into account, it
will be interesting to test the effect of BPA on the subcellular localization of amphiER and to study if other related
compounds are able to bind and/or activate amphiER. In
addition, it will be important, when cell cultures from
amphioxus are available, to check the activity of amphiER
in a monospecific transient transfection assay. It should
be remembered that some orphan receptors such as ERRs
are thought to have no natural ligands even if they are able
to bind synthetic compounds [59]. More generally, the
precise status of amphiER in terms of ligand binding
remains an open question. It is nevertheless clear, and this
is an important issue for the current evolutionary debate,
that amphiER is not able to bind estradiol.
Is there any receptor for estradiol in amphioxus?
The observation that amphiER does not bind E2 is indeed
a surprising observation since E2 was detected in amphioxus by RIA, the hormonal production being correlated
with breeding season [15]. Several aspects of steroid
metabolism were described in amphioxus [60] and the
homologues of many enzymes necessary for estradiol syn-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/219

thesis in mammals were cloned from amphioxus ovaries
[15,61]. Of particular interest is the report of an aromatase
gene (CYP19) in amphioxus, which suggests that the crucial step in estradiol synthesis is indeed possible in
amphioxus. These experimental data were recently confirmed by the analysis of the complete amphioxus
genome sequence [35]. It may be that, in amphioxus, the
active sex hormone is an E2-derivative [62] or another sex
hormone, like in the case of androgens in lamprey [63],
and this derivative is still to be discovered. In a similar
way, we recently demonstrated that the amphioxus TR
orthologue does not bind T3 or T4, the classical thyroid
hormones, but deaminated derivatives TRIAC and TETRAC, which are able to induce amphioxus metamorphosis
[64].
A second possibility is that E2 itself has a central role in sex
maturation in amphioxus, and that the functional estrogen receptor in amphioxus is different from amphiER.
Several candidates are possible. First, there is another steroid receptor in amphioxus (amphiNR3C in Figures 1 and
2) [35] that exhibits several ER-like features. Its P- and Dboxes are closer to ERs than to vertebrate NR3C (Figure
2A). The sequence identity of its LBD with human ERα
(37%) and with NR3C members (35%) are similar. Moreover, most of the amino acids involved in ligand binding
are more ER-like than AR-, PR- or MR-like (Figure 1).
However it is the only NR3C receptor (orthologous to AR,
PR, MR and GR) found in the amphioxus genome. Thus if
amphiNR3C plays the role of an estradiol receptor, this
suggests an absence of a "classical" steroid receptor able to
bind testosterone, progesterone or corticoids. Alternatively, a non-nuclear receptor could mediate E2 action in
amphioxus. Indeed, several non-genomic effects of estradiol were reported in mammals involving GPCRs (for
reviews see [65-67]). For instance, very recently, a high
affinity receptor for the steroid androstenedione linked to
the membrane, was described in lamprey [68] and a
GPCR with high affinity for progestines was isolated from
sea trout [69].
Implications for the evolution of ERs
The absence of E2 binding by the amphioxus estrogen
receptor has interesting consequences for the evolution of
SRs and ERs. Indeed, only the well characterized gnathostome ERs and the lamprey ER (studied here) have been
shown to mediate E2 action. Outside vertebrates, all the
ERs studied so far (in mollusks and amphioxus) do not
bind E2 [11,12,24-26]. Parsimony implies that the function of estradiol in the bilaterian ancestor was not mediated by ER and that ER had another function. Only later
during evolution, in the vertebrate lineage, ER would then
have gained the ability to be activated by E2 and to mediate the hormonal action of this compound (Figure 8). The
alternative scenario (ancestral E2 binding and independ-

ent loss of either ER itself or E2 binding to ER in mollusks
and invertebrate deuterostomes) is more costly in terms of
evolutionary events, even if the hypothesis of an NR3C
orthologue binding E2 is taken into account. Thus, taken
together, our results do not support previous scenarios of
steroid receptor evolution based on a reconstruction of
the ancestral steroid hormone receptor AncSR1 [8,11].
To describe the evolution of a protein, being able to study
ancestral sequences at different nodes of a phylogeny
would obviously provide historically relevant information that is not available otherwise [70]. However such
sequences have disappeared long ago and can only be statistically estimated. The accuracy and bias of these estimations therefore need to be investigated. Indeed, functional
studies of ancestral sequences are of any value only if the
ancestral reconstruction is reliable enough. The confidence associated with the previously published ancestral
steroid receptor is quite low. Indeed, the overall accuracy
of the reconstruction of the LBD (AncSR1) was only 62%
[11]. This is similar for the ancestor inferred here (Anc-

Model of evolution of the ligand binding ability of ERs
Model of evolution of the ligand binding ability of ERs.
On a classical phylogenetic tree of bilaterians, data available
on the binding ability of all known ERs have been indicated.
Two hypotheses are compared in terms of parsimony,
whether the ancestral ER was liganded (in blue) or not (ie an
orphan receptor) (in red). This result displays different costs
in terms of parsimony: one unique event of gain specifically in
vertebrate for the "ancestral ER orphan" hypothesis against
at least two parallel events of loss of binding for the "ancestral ER binding E2" hypothesis. In addition, three events of
loss of the ER gene in urochordates, echinoderms and
insects+nematodes are implied by the current distribution of
the gene across metazoans.

SRa) on an enriched dataset, with an overall accuracy of
the DBD+LBD of 70%. Moreover, amino acid uncertainty
was high at many sites of AncSRa and AncSR1: more than
60 sites have more than 1 possible amino acid with a
probability superior to 0.2. If one were to make an exhaustive study, one would need to reconstruct and test more
than 1024 potential proteins (if all possible combinations
of amino acids with probability > 0.2 were tested). In fact
several of the sites involved in ligand binding have low
probabilities. Examples of more reliable reconstructions
of nuclear receptors have been published, e.g. the ancestor
of MR and GR (mineralocortoid and glucocorticoid receptors) in which the overall accuracy of the LBD was above
99%, with no disrupting mutation at any site [71]. The
reconstructed ancestor of RARs also showed a high average confidence (99% [13]). This discrepancy between
results obtained on the ancestor of all steroid receptors or
merely of MR and GR for instance, can be explained by the
higher sequence divergence observed among all SRs than
simply among subfamilies MR and GR (see branch length
in Figure 2B). Consequently, the uncertainty associated to
the sequence of the ancestral steroid receptor as estimated
with nowadays methods is probably too high to provide a
firm basis for evolutionary conclusions. Moreover, the
phylogenetic reconstruction of ancestral sequences has
been shown to be biased towards the most frequent (and
more stable) amino acids, resulting in an under-estimation of the less frequent amino acids (the stability of the
ancestral protein is then over-estimated [72]). In reconstructions of ancient proteins, where the evolutionary signal has been lost due to a high number of substitutions,
such biases might be problematic. Thus, current reconstruction methods do not seem powerful enough to infer
a biologically meaningful ancestral steroid receptor given
the amount of divergence between sequences.
Nonetheless, all these reservations put aside, it is surprising that the previously reconstructed ancestral SR, is vertebrate ER-like. As almost all the extant sequences used as
matrix for the reconstruction came from vertebrates and
led to the estimation of a "vertebrate-like" ancestral
sequence, the same ancestral steroid receptor as previously published [11] was estimated, but adding more
sequences from various taxa. This reconstruction was
done using a phylogeny equivalent to the one previously
published [11]. Using this approach, the new AncSRa is
more divergent from vertebrate ERs than AncSR1. Interestingly AncSR1 was shown to bind E2 with a very low affinity (250 times lower affinity than human ERα [11]),
suggesting that AncSRa may be an even worse estradiol
receptor.
The bias of AncSR1 towards vertebrate ERs is explained by
a lack of non-vertebrate sequences used for the reconstruction. Indeed, removing some non-vertebrate sequences

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:219

from our dataset leads to an estimation of an ancestral
steroid receptor that is more "vertebrate ER"-like (AncSRb
in Figure 7). The clustering of AncSRb with the ER clade
and the exclusion of AncSRa from the ER clade were supported with good statistical values (minimum of Chi2based and SH-like supports of 0.83 and 0.89, respectively). Those data show that AncSR1 reconstruction was
probably sensitive to the vertebrate bias in the data set
(Figure 7). Overall, we suggest that analysis based on
ancestral reconstructions should be taken as tentative,
especially in case of low statistical confidence and limited
taxonomic sampling. In case of the ancestral steroid receptor, even if exhaustive taxonomic sampling is necessary,
phylogenetic signal is weak and the resulting confidence is
quite low. Thus we think that even if the ancestral
sequence built here is biologically more relevant than previously calculated ones (because of better taxonomic sampling), it remains quite uncertain. Consequently
conclusions regarding the ancestral steroid receptor
should be based mostly on comparative characterization
of extant receptors. In that case, all the data based on
invertebrate ER receptors (from mollusks and amphioxus)
support an ancestor of steroid receptors that was not able
to bind estradiol. This conclusion will obviously require
the functional characterization of ERs from other protostome phyla in order to carefully check if this observation
is general. Thus, available data converge towards a re-evaluation of the ancestral status of estrogen receptors.
Sequence conservation reflects functional constraints:
ligand binding ability is more recent than DNA-binding
ability
From our and previous studies, only vertebrate ERs are
able to bind and activate transcription under estradiol
stimulation [11,12,24-26]. The LBD of amphiER is more
divergent from its vertebrate counterparts (ca. 34% amino
acid identities) than the LBD of other liganded amphioxus nuclear receptors such as amphiRAR (ca. 58%),
which has been shown to bind the same ligand as its vertebrate homologue [7,13]. This suggests that a conserved
functional feature (e.g. binding to the same ligand) is
reflected in the sequence conservation of the LBD.

The same observation can be done concerning the DBD
since all ERs, including amphiER, have a highly conserved
DBD and are able to bind EREs. Thus, for this domain
also, a conservation of the function is reflected in
sequence conservation.
Accordingly with this notion, the LBD of invertebrate ERs
is highly divergent but their DNA binding domain, as well
as other functionally important domains not directly
linked to ligand binding such as the dimerization interface, or the amino acids responsible for interaction with
the co-activators [55] are well conserved. This is true for
amphiER as well as mollusk ERs. This strongly suggests

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/219

that amphiER is a bona fide NR regulating ERE-containing
genes in an E2-independent manner. Post-translational
modifications such as phosphorylation or the presence/
absence of other receptor-interacting proteins such as
transcriptional coactivators have been shown to regulate
unliganded nuclear receptors [73]. Whether one of these
mechanisms acts to regulate the activity of invertebrate
ERs or if those receptors have unknown ligands still to be
identified remains to be explored. Anyway our observations strongly suggest that for ERs, the DNA binding function of the receptor as well as its interaction with coregulators have been conserved due to selective pressure.
Interestingly, when studying the AncSRa, the P- and Dboxes in the DBD are ER/ERR-like (Figure 1), suggesting
that ER/ERR DNA binding ability is ancestral, in accordance with the fact that these are the only receptors of the
NR3 family found in invertebrates. This difference in the
selection pressure between DBD and LBD has been proposed to be a general evolutionary pattern for the whole
NR family [7]. The plasticity of the ligand binding ability
of NRs was recently illustrated in the case of RXR-USP
where the ability of the receptor to be regulated by a ligand was suggested to have been subject to several successive episodes of gain and loss during evolution [74].
Evolution of endocrine systems: refinement of the ligand
exploitation model
The ligand exploitation model hypothesizes how new
hormones and new receptors appear during evolution. It
suggests that the ancestral ligand is the last metabolite of
a synthesis pathway [8]. According to this model, the
ancestral steroid ligand was estradiol (and the ancestral SR
bound estradiol). During evolution, other steroid receptors appeared by duplication of the ancestral ER and
gained the ability to bind other steroids, intermediate in
the synthesis pathway (like testosterone or progesterone).

Our findings on the evolution of ERs do not support the
ligand exploitation model, since our data strongly suggest
that the ancestral ER did not bind estradiol. However, as
estradiol has been detected in deuterostomes as well as
protostomes (for instance in vertebrates, amphioxus,
echinoderms, mollusks, for review, see [75]), steroid signaling may have been already present in bilaterian ancestor. However, up to now, the ancestral steroid molecule
remains to be determined. If estradiol is an ancient hormone, it then probably bound another receptor and later
on ER gained the ability to recognize it, as did other steroid receptors for their extant ligand. Thus the evolution of
steroid system intermingles two distinct processes, the
evolution of the receptor on one hand, and the evolution
of the ligand on the other.
The receptor can evolve by point mutations and change its
affinity for a ligand towards another. This idea was convincingly exemplified in the case of corticoid receptors

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:219

(the ancestor of MR and GR) for which it was recently
demonstrated that ability of the ancestral vertebrate corticoid receptor to bind gnathostome-specific hormone
aldosterone (a MR ligand) was a by-product of its ability
to bind the ancestral ligand 11-deoxycorticosterone
(DOC) [71]. GR gained the ability to bind cortisol only in
the gnathostome lineage, in parallel to endogenous synthesis of the hormone [16,71]. This detailed study shows
that a receptor binding a given ligand can acquire affinity
for compounds present in the cell that are structurally
close to its natural ligand: this refines the ligand exploitation model, since new ligands are not necessarily precursors of ancient ligands, simply compounds present in the
cell and structurally close to the ancestral ligand. Similar
conclusions were drawn previously in the case of RAR evolution [13]. It has to be emphasized that the pool of available compounds is also subject to evolutionary changes in
parallel. For instance, the spatiotemporal production of
estradiol is variable in the different vertebrate groups
(reviewed in [76]). Glucocorticoids differ in mouse (cortisol) and in human (corticosterone), with both hormones
being GR ligands [77]. There are several androgens in teleost fishes, with 11-ketotestosterone being teleost-specific
[78]. As there are 2 androgen receptors (ARs) in teleost
fishes, from a whole genome duplication [79], the study
of the ligand-binding ability of those ARs is a potentially
interesting case for the evolution of endocrine systems. As
highlighted by Bridgham et al. (2006), lamprey does not
produce cortisol [71]. In accordance, their genomes do
not contain the sequence corresponding to the enzyme
responsible for cortisol synthesis (11b-hydroxylase) and
in general classical steroids except estradiol are rarely
found in lamprey. This suggests that the steroids actually
found in lamprey are different from the ones found in
mammals (reviewed in [80]). Those cases exemplify the
largely underestimated diversity of endocrine systems:
except for lamprey and some teleost fishes, the hormonal
pool of animals remains largely unknown. As proposed
for the study of steroid receptors, a comparative approach
should be applied to determine the metabolism of steroids in poorly studied animals. Indeed, the hormonal
pool of such animals is usually evaluated from the presence/absence of putative orthologues of mammalian
enzymes. As the enzymatic machinery involved in hormonal metabolism has a very labile activity (reviewed in
[81,82]), equating orthology with functional identity
might be unreliable.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/219

min D receptor (VDR) or liver × receptor (LXR)/ecdysone
receptor (Ecr), has been extensively studied and is not in
line with the ligand exploitation model [83-85]. For
instance, comparative functional studies of FXRs from various chordate species showed that the vertebrate FXRs
bind "late" cholesterol derivatives (from a complex synthesis pathway) but are thought to have evolved from an
ancestral FXR that bound early cholesterol derivatives
(from a simpler synthesis pathway) [83].
In other cases, the evolution of ligand binding is more
"chaotic" with close orthologs having a selective ligand
binding ability that varies extensively (vertebrate VDRs are
very well conserved when PXRs have the widest ligand
repertoire of all NRs) [83].
These complex histories are probably linked to specific
function of some of those NRs, considered as xenotoxic
compounds "sensors". This tight relationship with the
unstable environment probably makes receptors like FXR
and especially PXR more prone to fast evolution [86]. Yet
they illustrate the impressive variety of scenarios of NR
evolution.

Conclusion
In this article, we demonstrated that vertebrate ERs
(including lamprey ER) are estradiol receptors whilst nonvertebrate ER (including amphioxus ER) are not. The most
parsimonous scenario proposes that the ancestral ER was
not able to bind estradiol and that it had another function. It later gained the ability to be regulated by estradiol,
specifically in the vertebrate lineage. However, additional
critical data remains to be discovered in poorly studied
taxa [62]. To fully understand the evolution of steroid signaling pathway, a larger number of taxa need to be targeted for detailed comparative studies. More precisely,
ERs and other steroid receptors should be cloned from
widely distributed taxa, especially in protostomes.
Enzymes involved in steroidogenesis should also be
cloned and characterized, to understand the evolution of
steroid availability. In order to avoid the blinders of a
"vertebrate-centered" view, it is of particular importance
to establish the steroid hormone repertoire of an enlarged
animal panel, including more protostomes. The description of various endocrine systems will certainly be relevant to the early evolution of hormone signaling.

Cloning of amphiER
An initial piece of amphiER was obtained by degenerate

either from developing B. floridae embryos and larvae (at
13 h–15 h, 28 h, 36 h, 48 h or 3 d–4 d of development)
or from B. floridae adults. The oligonucleotides used were

as follows: forward primer 5'-TGYGARGGITGYAARGCITTYTT-3' and reverse primer 5'-GTRCAYTSRTTIGTIGCIGGRCA-3'.

embryos, 3 d–4 d larvae and B. floridae adults. The PCR
protocol used was as follows:
10' 94 degrees

The touchdown PCR program used was as follows:
5× (30" 94 degrees, 30" 55 degrees, 2' 72 degrees)
5' 94 degrees
5× (30" 94 degrees, 1' 55 degrees, 1' 72 degrees)
5× the same cycle, but at 50 degrees annealing temperature
5× the same cycle, but at 45 degrees annealing temperature
5× the same cycle, but at 40 degrees annealing temperature
25× the same cycle, but at 37 degrees annealing temperature
7' 72 degrees
All degenerate PCRs irrespective of the RT reaction template used yielded a 83 bp fragment of amphiER. The fragment was sequenced on both strands and used for the
design of oligonucleotides for 5' and 3' RACE experiments
with the Invitrogen GeneRacer Kit. The template for the
RACE experiments was pooled total RNA from 13 h–15 h
B. floridae embryos and from B. floridae adults. In addition to the oligonucleotides provided by the kit, for the 3'
RACE, the following primers were used:
3' RACE, 1st PCR: 5'-AACGGAGCATTCAGCAAGGTC-3'
3' RACE, 2nd PCR: 5'-GCATTCAGCAAGGTCAGACAG-3'
5' RACE, 1st strand cDNA synthesis: 5'-ATGTAATCTGTCTGACCTTGC-3'
5' RACE, 1st PCR: 5'-CTGTCTGACCTTGCTGAATGC-3'
5' RACE, 2nd PCR: 5'-TCTGACCTTGCTGAATGCTCC-3'
The protocols for the 1st and 2nd round of PCR experiments are given in the Invitrogen GeneRacer Kit. The 3'
and 5' RACE products were subsequently sequenced on
both strands and used for the design of oligonucleotides
for the full-length cloning of amphiER: forward primer 5'CGGCGAAGCGAAGAAGATCGAG-3' and reverse primer
5'-CTTAACCGATACTAACGGAACAG-3'. The full-length
amphiER was obtained by PCR on pooled RT reactions
from total RNA extracted from B. floridae 13 h–15 h

35× the same cycle, but at 50 degrees annealing temperature
10' 72 degrees
The full-length amphiER clone resulting from this PCR is
2279 bp long, was cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and subsequently sequenced on both strands.
Plasmid constructs and reagents
Full length amphiER were amplified by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) and the obtained fragments were inserted
into a pSG5 vector between EcoR1 sites. Lamprey ER was
a generous gift from JW Thornton. Human pSG5-ERα and
pSG5-ERβ and the 3xERE-Luc luciferase reporter construct
have been described previously [87]. The pS2-Luc reporter
construct encompasses an 1100 bp estrogen-responsive
region of the human pS2 promoter inserted into the pGL3
basic vector (Promega). Chimeras comprising the GAL4
DNA-binding domain fused with the LBD of the human
ERα (residues 251 to 595), the LBD of amphiER (residues
364 to 705), the LBD of lampER (residues 234 to 554)
have been cloned in the pG4MpolyII vector. 17β-estradiol, genistein, 3β-androstenediol, resveratrol, cholesterol, cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, 22®hydroxycholesterol, 20-Hydroxyecdysone, pregnenolone,

5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one
and
1a,25Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) were purchased from
Sigma. Enterolactone was a generous gift from Dr Sari
Mäkelä [88].
Phylogenetic analysis of NR3
Protein sequences of NR3 family members were obtained
from GenBank by BLAST search using Homo sapiens ERα as
a query. Eight additional sequences from the closely
related RXR group were also obtained to serve as outgroup
sequences. For accession numbers of the sequences used,
see Additional file 8.

The retrieved sequences were aligned using the muscle 3.6
program [89] and the resulting alignment was manually
corrected with SEAVIEW [90]. Phylogenetic tree was calculated by maximum likelihood as implemented in PhyML
version 2.4.3 under a JTT substitution matrix plus a eightcategory gamma rate correction (α estimated) and with
the proportion of invariant sites estimated. Both the DBD

and the LBD were used. Robustness was assessed by bootstrap analysis (1,000 repetitions) [91].
The Bayesian inference was done using the program
MrBayes 3.1.2 [92]. Two simultaneous independent runs
were performed. For each run, one chain was sampled
every 100 generations for 1,000,000 generations after the
burn-in cycles, until the average SD of split frequencies
was <0.01; additionally, the potential scale reduction factors of the parameters were close to or equal to 1, which
indicates that the runs had most probably converged. The
neighbour-joining (Poisson correction) and maximum
parsimony trees were done with Phylo_win [90].
Likelihood-based tests of alternative topologies placing
amphiER at all possible positions in the tree
The 149 trees were built by reconnecting amphiER from
the maximum likelihood tree, into the 149 possible positions. The branch length and the different parameters of
the obtained trees were re-estimated using PhyML. Likelihood-based tests of the 149 alternative topologies were
calculated using CONSEL: site-wise log-likelihood values,
available as output of PhyML, were used to calculate the
P-values of the different positions according to the AU test
with the software R.
Ancestral sequence reconstruction
The aminoacid sequence of the ancestral AncSRa and AncSRb was inferred only for the most conserved part of the
alignment, i.e. the DBD and LBD (defined as in Figure 1).
The ancestral sequences were reconstructed by maximum
likelihood as implemented in PAML [48], under the JTT
substitution model and a gamma distribution with 8 categories of rates across sites, using the tree described in
Additional file 1A for AncSRa and a the same topology
truncated of the mollusk ER sequences and the amphioxus NR3 sequences, after reestimation of the branch
lengths using phyml (JTT+γ) for AncSRb.
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)
EMSAs were performed as previously described [93].
Where indicated, a 10- and 100-fold molar excess of 30bp unlabeled oligonucleotides (a consensus ERE and a
non-related probe) were added as competitors. The
sequence of the probe containing the consensus ERE is 5'and
CGGGCCGAGGTCACAGTGACCTCGGCCCGT-3'
the sequence of the non-related probe is 5'-CTAGTCCTAGGTCTAGAGAATTCA-3'.
Cell culture and transfections
Human embryonic kidney 293 cell culture and transfections using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) were
done according to the manufacturer's recommendations
and as previously described [94]. Briefly, 200 ng of the
chimeras comprising the GAL4 DNA-binding domain

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/219

fused with the LBD of either human ERα, lampER or
AmphiER (or LBD for the control) were co-transfected
together with 100 ng of reporter plasmid and 10 ng of a βgalactosidase expression vector, included as a control for
transfection efficiency. For the mammalian double hybrid
assays, the GAL4-amphiER-LBD chimera was transfected
with 200 ng of the coactivator SRC1 fused to the strong
activation domain VP16. Three to five hours post-transfection, serum and hormones (as indicated in the figures)
were added to the cells which were incubated for an additional 48 hours before harvest and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined. Results show the
mean ± s.e.m. (n = 3) of representative experiments.
Human HeLa cervical cancer cells and CV-1 green monkey
kidney cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's
modified eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine seum, 1% v/v L-glutamine and 1%
v/v penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were seeded in 12 or 24
well plates one day prior to transfection. Transient transfections were carried out using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent according to instructions of the manufacturer
(Invitrogen) in culture media devoid of serum, phenolred and antibiotics. Briefly, 1 ng of ERα, ERβ or AmphiER
expression vectors were co-transfected together with 100
ng 3xERE-Luc (or 200 ng pS2-Luc where indicated) and 20
ng of a β-galactosidase expression vector, included as a
control for transfection efficiency. In the co-expression
experiments, AmphiER was co-transfected together with
ERα or ERβ in ratios of 0.5:1, 1:1 and 1:5, respectively.
Three hours post-transfection, serum and hormones (as
indicated in the figures) were added to the cells which
were thereafter incubated for an additional 48 hours
before harvest and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities
were determined. Figures represent results from at least
three independent experiments performed in duplicates.
Data is presented as mean +/- SD of fold induction of relative luciferase values corrected against β-galactosidase
activity, where activity obtained from transfected reporter
plasmid alone and treated with vehicle, was arbitrarily set
to 1.
Limited proteolytic digestion
These assays were done as previously described [13].

Phylogenetic analysis of NR3 sequences using several methods. Phylogenetical trees of an alignment comprising 69 NR3 sequences as well as
RXR sequences were inferred using the maximum likelihood method
(ML) (A), Bayesian analysis (B), neighbour-joining method (C) and
maximum parsimony method (MP) (D) based on an elision alignment of
the DBD and LBD of 77 NR3 and RXRs (accession numbers are given in
Additional file 8). Labels above each branch show percentages of bootstrap
values after 1000 replicates (A), posterior probabilities (B), percentages
of bootstrap values after 500 replicates (C) or 100 replicates (D). The
fastest evolving sites (with an evolutionary rape above 2, as indicated in
the Figure 3A) were removed from the alignment before computing phylogeny by maximum parsimony, to preserve the branching of mollusk ERs
within the ER clade. In (A) nodes with bootstrap values below 50% are
presented as polytomies, as in the Figure 2B.

DNA binding characterization of chordate ERs. Various chordate members of the NR3 family, namely human ERα, human ERβ, mouse ERRα,
amphiER and lamprey ER, were synthesized in vitro and allowed to bind
to a 32P-labeled consensus ERE probe in an EMSA. Lane 1, empty vector
(pSG5) reticulocytes lysates. Lanes 2–5, human ERα. Lanes 6–9, human
ERβ. Lanes 10–13, mouse ERRα. Lanes 14–17, amphiER. Lanes 18–21,
lamprey ER. Lanes 3–5, 7–9, 11–13, 15–17, 19–21, unlabeled non-specific oligonucleotide (NS) or ERE were added at indicated molar excess as
competitors to test the specificity of the binding. The arrows indicated the
gel shift induced by amphiER binding the ERE probe. The asterisk indicates free ERE probe.

The amphioxus ER acts as a dominant negative estrogen receptor in
CV1 cells. A pSG5 construct containing human ERα (A) or human ERβ
(B) was tested in transfected CV1 cells for its ability to activate the cotransfected cognate ERE-luc reporter plasmid after E2, genistein or βAndrostane-diol stimulation (10-6M) in presence of increasing doses of
the amphiER construct.

The amphioxus ER is not activated by BPA. (A) GAL4-LBD constructs
from several chordate ERs were tested in transfected 293 cells for their
ability to activate a (17 m)5x-G-luc reporter plasmid in the presence of
increasing doses of BPA (10-9M to 10-6M). (B) Representation of the
mammalian two-hybrid SRC1 recruitment assay. The GAL4-amphiERLBD chimera was used with the coactivator SRC1 fused to the strong activation domain VP16 to transfect 293 cells in the presence of increasing
doses of BPA (10-9M to 10-6M).

Phylogenetic tree of NR3 sequences as well as ancestral sequences.
Complete tree corresponding to the simplified one presented in the figure
7. The ancestral sequence of ER and NR3C was inferred using either a
complete dataset (AncSRa) or a partial dataset (AncSRb) where 5 mollusk ER sequences as well as amphiER and amphiNR3C were omitted.
The position of those sequences within the phylogenetic tree calculated
with the complete dataset was compared. The position of a previously
described ancestor (AncSR1) is indicated as well. Minimum of Chi2based and SH-like supports are shown for each branch.
