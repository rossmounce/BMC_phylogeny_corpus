Abstract
Background: Domains, evolutionarily conserved units of proteins, are widely used to classify
protein sequences and infer protein function. Often, two or more overlapping domain models
match a region of a protein sequence. Therefore, procedures are required to choose appropriate
domain annotations for the protein. Here, we propose a method for assigning NCBI-curated
domains from the Curated Domain Database (CDD) that takes into account the organization of
the domains into hierarchies of homologous domain models.
Findings: Our analysis of alignment scores from NCBI-curated domain assignments suggests that
identifying the correct model among closely related models is more difficult than choosing between
non-overlapping domain models. We find that simple heuristics based on sorting scores and
domain-specific thresholds are effective at reducing classification error. In fact, in our test set, the
heuristics result in almost 90% of current misclassifications due to missing domain subfamilies being
replaced by more generic domain assignments, thereby eliminating a significant amount of error
within the database.
Conclusion: Our proposed domain subfamily assignment rule has been incorporated into the CDSearch software for assigning CDD domains to query protein sequences and has significantly
improved pre-calculated domain annotations on protein sequences in NCBI's Entrez resource.

Background
A major goal in the post-genomic world is to infer protein
function from sequence information. One popular
approach is to classify protein families or domains by
grouping homologous sequences and annotating the
groups with properties such as general function, intracellular location, three-dimensional structure, conserved
sequence patterns or motifs, evolutionary origin, and
binding and active sites. Novel proteins can be characterized quickly by assigning a group via profile search methods. However, more than one family or subfamily may

exhibit similarity to overlapping sequence intervals and to
a degree that seems convincing (Figure 1). Assigning the
protein to the correct group not only yields the correct
annotations, but may also help to avoid propagating
annotation errors and alleviate current issues with mislabelling in protein sequence databases [1,2]. Here, we
examine the problem of making correct domain assignments from the Conserved Domain Database [3,4].
Domains are evolutionarily conserved units in proteins
and frequently correspond to recurrent structural and

Figure assignment among closely related domains
Domain 1
Domain assignment among closely related domains. (A) Schematic of NCBI-curated hierarchy illustrating domain models from the Ribokinase/pfkB superfamily (cl00192). Each domain model is pictured as a multiple sequence alignment. Parent
and child models are defined to share at least one (overlapping) sequence (blue, purple, and green lines). The root domain of
this hierarchy represents the whole superfamily and provides information about the conserved core regions and sequence variation within the superfamily. Its many subfamilies include the ribokinase-like subgroups A and D and KdgK. Ideally, a query
sequence is labelled by the most specific domain that matches the sequence and that domain would yield the most significant
hit. (B) A partial list of domain hits to query protein [Entrez:BAA97341] with domain accessions, names, and the E-values of
their RPS-BLAST alignments to the query sequence. Previously, BAA97341 would have been assigned the domain with lowest
E-value, cd01942. Our proposed method assesses the hit to cd01942 against a pre-computed, domain-specific threshold to
determine that the hit with lowest E-value is not significant enough to be a confident match. Instead, we label the sequence
generically by the superfamily of the best-matching domain, or cl00192.

functional units. The particular function of a protein
depends on its combination of domains; two-thirds of
prokaryotic proteins and 80% of eukaryotic proteins have
more than one domain. To create new protein functions,
novel domain architectures arise through domain rearrangement and recombination, frequently through gene
duplication and fission or fusion events [5,6]. A domain
may be represented as a multiple sequence alignment
(MSA) of homologous sequence fragments. To identify

the domains in a query protein sequence, the MSAs are
converted into scoring models such as hidden Markov
model or position-specific scoring matrix for use with
database search algorithms such HMMER [7] and RPSBLAST [8].
To refine protein annotation, domains models may be
subdivided to represent more specific functions or conserved features. CDD curators apply phylogenetic and

structural analysis to construct hierarchies of homologous
domain models, related by common descent, to reflect
aspects of their evolutionary histories [3,4]. Curation follows an iterative procedure to split domain models into
subfamilies that redistributes sequences into more narrowly defined models. In the hierarchy tree structure, the
leaf domains represent highly conserved and often orthologous protein subgroups. Their precursor (internal)
domains, on the other hand, reflect ancient gene duplication events, as CDD aims to categorize ancient conserved
domain families.
It may seem natural that once the profiles have been
defined, the most significant match to a query sequence is
the correct one. Indeed, domains from Pfam [9,10] and
SMART [11] are assigned following the lowest alignment
E-value that exceeds a family-specific cutoff [12,13]. This
straightforward approach works well when the candidate
domains are disjoint. Domain subfamilies may be
obtained through automated methods such as the SCIPHY algorithm for identifying functional subtypes of
known domain families [14,15] or by mirroring other
hierarchical domain classifications such as SCOP [16] and
CATH [17]. However, subfamily assignment methods
generally attempt to classify a member of a family at the
subfamily level given that the family is known, as in a statistical pairwise/profile method proposed for SUPERFAMILY [18-20].
The systematic arrangement of CDD domains requires
identifying the most suitable level of resolution among
domain models that offer more or less fine-grained
descriptions of a protein. We take the viewpoint that if a
protein cannot be associated unambiguously with a specific subgroup or may be a member of a subgroup that has
not been defined, the protein can be assigned a more
generic domain model or the superfamily in general. Consequently the ideal domain assignment to a query
sequence will be the most specific domain, within a candidate hierarchy, with a strong match to the sequence.
Here, we analyze a set of correct domain assignments
from CDD to establish an improved method for assigning
domains to query sequences. The effectiveness of a traditional alignment score and domain-specific threshold is
of particular interest, as this method is efficient and makes
use of alignment information that is already computed for
CDD.
Constructing a benchmark set of correct domain
assignments
To benchmark domain assignment heuristics, a reference
set of domain assignments is constructed from the NCBIcurated portion of CDD v. 2.12. This set contains every
sequence fragment present among the MSAs and its
domain assignment. The NCBI-curated domains have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/1/114

undergone rigorous testing to optimize the MSAs and distributions of representative sequence fragments.
The correct or most specific domain for each sequence in
a hierarchy is defined as the domain having no descendant that contains an overlapping sequence interval. Two
sequence intervals from one protein are said to overlap if
one sequence interval contains at least 30% of the positions of the other. While each sequence has been placed in
the most specific domain model that characterizes it, this
step is required as parent and child domains share overlapping sequences (Figure 1). Sequences with overlapping
regions from more than one hierarchy are counted once
for each hierarchy. Non-overlapping regions of a protein
are treated independently. Alignments between all NCBIcurated domains and proteins present in the public Entrez
protein set at time of analysis (September 2007) [21] have
been pre-computed using RPS-BLAST. In this analysis, the
alignment score refers to the bitscore, a normalized version of the raw alignment score between the query
sequence and the PSSM, which allows alignments from
different searches to be compared. The bitscore corresponds roughly to the alignment E-value and is used
instead to avoid real value rounding issues.
A significant PSSM-sequence alignment is called a hit, for
brevity. We call a match between a sequence region and its
correct domain a self hit to distinguish it from other hits to
overlapping sequence regions. Other hits to the sequences
in the reference dataset serve as examples of incorrect
domain assignments.
CDD v 2.12 contains 3078 NCBI-curated domains in 495
hierarchies, including 298 single-domain "hierarchies"
and 197 trees with 2357 leaf and 423 internal domains.
Many sequence fragments used to construct the NCBIcurated domain profiles come from proteins that have
been replaced with newer versions or declared obsolete.
Among the 109186 representative sequences in NCBIcurated domain hierarchies, over 21% have no hits and
more than 90% of those sequences are no longer present
in Entrez. This analysis excludes the 149 curated domains
without corresponding live data in Entrez, leaving 2929
domains.
Performance of a simple high-score assignment method
We begin by assessing the performance of the previous
method for assigning NCBI-curated domains from CDD.
The NCBI CD-Search tool [22] has historically relied on
alignment E-value and properties such as the source
domain database to highlight one or a few most likely
domain assignments, without claiming to pinpoint the
correct domain assignment. Analysis of all hits to the
sequences in the benchmark set reveals that assigning
domains by high alignment score alone achieves 96%

accuracy over all sequences and 100% accuracy over the
representative sequences for 91.5% of domain models.
Further, categorizing non-self hits by their hierarchical
relationships to the correct domain reveals that assigning
to a subclass of the correct domain is the most common
type of error when a sequence matches the correct domain
and other domains (Table 1). For simplicity, all non-self
hits are labelled as incorrect hits in the tables although
some child/descendant and parent/ancestor assignments
may not be regarded as actual classification errors. Child/
descendant domains score higher than the self hit for
21.8% of sequences with both types of hits. These higher
scores may reflect computational bias from longer profiles, overly cautious assignment of a sequence to a more
generic domain, or missing subfamilies. In contrast,
higher scores from parent/ancestor domains or domains
from other branches of a hierarchy are rarely observed. For
additional data and discussion of all analyses described in
this document, see [Additional file 1].
We define a score threshold for each domain to be the
lowest self-hit score to that domain among all of its
sequences in the benchmark set. This additional heuristic,
in particular, reduces incorrect assignments to subclasses
as only 9.1% of hits to subclasses score above the thresholds for those subclasses (Table 2). The threshold definition works around the issue of small data size–over 60%
of domains have 20 or fewer self hits–and addresses variances in scores between domains due to properties such as
length and residue composition, or practical issues such as
incomplete local alignments, which are not considered by
simple high-score heuristics. The definition is more
restrictive than its Pfam counterpart, the minimum alignment score among all sequences in the automated "full
alignment", as NCBI-curated hierarchies in CDD tend to
present a finer-grained classification of a protein domain
family.

Proposed rule for specific domain assignment
We propose to label a single domain as correct or specific
for a protein sequence region if its alignment score is highest among all domains that align to overlapping regions of
the protein sequence and the score exceeds a pre-calculated threshold for the domain, defined as the minimum
alignment score among confirmed members of the
domain. Sequence intervals that are difficult to group with
a specific subclass with high confidence following this
rule may receive only generic domain assignments.
Assuming that the set of overlapping domains represents
an ancient domain superfamily, such a generic assignment would be characterized as membership with the
respective superfamily.
Reducing misclassifications and errors due to missing
subfamilies
A more concrete picture of the effect of the proposed rule
may be gleaned by quantifying misclassifications, defined
to be either descendants of the correct domain or domains
that lie in other branches of the correct hierarchy. Averaged over domains in multi-domain hierarchies and
counting only sequences with self hits, the misclassification rate using high scores only is 2.6%. Incorporating
score thresholds to eliminate low-scoring best hits reduces
the misclassification rate to 0.85%. Misclassifications may
also be used to estimate error due to missing subfamilies.
Not all subclasses in a domain hierarchy may have been
identified as the available sequence databases only provide a terse snapshot of protein domain diversity. We simulate a cross-validation experiment to ask, if an existing
domain model were missing from a hierarchy, what fraction of its sequence intervals have best hits to other models in the hierarchy that are not ancestors of the correct
model? Averaged over leaf domains, 50.9% of domain
assignments made from high alignment score alone are
misclassifications, compared to 6.0% of domain assignments after thresholds are used to screen hits.

Function and classification through specific domain
assignments: Glycyl radical enzymes
To illustrate the effect of our proposed method, we examine domain assignments from the glycyl radical enzymes
(RNR_PFL hierarchy). Its subgroups have distinct and
important functions, including ribonucleotide reductases
(RNRs), which synthesize deoxyribonucleotides, and
pyruvate-formate lysases (PFLs), a family of catabolic
enzymes. The proposed method places the sequence [Entrez:CAA42118] into RNR class 1 and places [Entrez:
AAZ61477] into RNR class-1-like domain. The functions
of these proteins are inferred by their subclass. Other proteins receive generic assignments to this family. For example, PFL2 (cd01677) is the best match to
[Entrez:ABX41552] and [Entrez:EDQ26237] with alignment scores that fall short of the PFL2 threshold. The first
alignment includes a long insertion (gap), and the latter
exhibits weak sequence similarity; in both of these scenarios the transfer of functional annotation may not be
straightforward.

Domain assignments also help to make biological
insights. RNRs fall into classes that use different mechanisms and/or cofactors. Class 1 is oxygen dependent and
class 3 is used by strictly or facultative anaerobic organisms. RNR_1_like has a similar active site to class 1 and at
the time of curation, no specific literature was available
about this subclass. We observed that the strictly anaerobic organism Chlorobium limicola DSM 24 has RNR_3 proteins (e.g. [Entrez:ZP_00512827]) as well as an enzyme
([Entrez:ZP_00512727]) that matches RNR_1_like, suggesting that RNR_1_like, a subfamily lacking experimental characterization, may contain non-oxygen dependent
versions of RNR_1.

Discussion
While many sequences can be classified by sequence similarity, profiles of protein domain families make it possi-

ble to quickly classify more distant homologs [23] and
can better handle multi-domain proteins. An important
step in transferring annotations from known protein families is identifying the subclass that provides the best characterization for the protein. Here, we conducted the first
focused analysis of domain assignments from CDD in
order to assess existing methods for domain and domain
subfamily assignment and identify ways to improve the
quality of assignments. We find that best-scoring hits are
sometimes too specific, causing a sequence to be mislabelled by a subfamily of the correct domain. We propose
a subclass assignment procedure that enables concrete
assignments, computed quickly using existing data, and
demonstrate that this procedure largely avoids over-predictions or false positive assignments and is robust
enough to deal with situations such as incomplete hierarchies in which not all subfamilies have been identified.
We elected to not employ standard jack-knife or cross-validation testing for a sequence against its correct domain,
as the task is to classify sequence fragments that are very
similar to a subfamily, where the subfamily model is also
constructed from very similar sequences.
Although the sequence and domain databases evolve rapidly, we expect our findings to provide an accurate snapshot for some time. A version of our proposed method has
been incorporated into the current version of the CDSearch program and the pre-calculated annotation of proteins with domains in NCBI's Entrez system. Domain
assignments to specific orthologous subfamilies or
ancient subfamilies are distinguished from non-specific
assignments to a domain superfamily. High-confidence
annotation of functional sites is also provided following
these results. We hope the improved ability to quickly and
accurately classify proteins will be a valuable step toward
simplifying protein sequence analysis and the computational annotation of genomes.
