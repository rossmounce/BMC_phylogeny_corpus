COMMENTARY

Coupling histone homeostasis to centromere
integrity via the ubiquitin-proteasome system
Commentary

Yuko Takayama*1 and Takashi Toda*2

Abstract
In many eukaryotes, histone gene expression is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, with a spike pattern at S
phase. In fission yeast the GATA-type transcription factor Ams2 is required for transcriptional activation of all the core
histone genes during S phase and Ams2 protein levels per se show concomitant periodic patterns. We have recently
unveiled the molecular mechanisms underlying Ams2 fluctuation during the cell cycle. We have found that Ams2
stability varies during the cell cycle, and that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is responsible for Ams2 instability.
Intriguingly, Ams2 proteolysis requires Hsk1-a Cdc7 homologue in fission yeast generally called Dbf4-dependent
protein kinase (DDK)-and the SCF ubiquitin ligase containing the substrate receptor Pof3 F-box protein. Here, we
discuss why histone synthesis has to occur only during S phase. Our results indicate that excess synthesis of core
histones outside S phase results in deleterious effects on cell survival. In particular, functions of the centromere, in
which the centromere-specific H3 variant CENP-A usually form centromeric nucleosomes, are greatly compromised.
This defect is, at least in part, ascribable to abnormal incorporation of canonical histone H3 into these nucleosomes.
Finally, we address the significance and potential implications of our work from an evolutionary point of view.
Introduction
The timely and selective proteolysis of proteins is essential for cell cycle control. Particularly, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a pivotal role in cell cycle transition
and progression [1]. Substrate proteins are ubiquitylated
by the enzymatic cascade consisting of ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and
ubiquitin ligase (E3) [2]. The E3 ligase determines the
substrate specificity of the pathway. These ubiquitin
transferase reactions result in the formation of polyubiquitin chains on substrates, which are recognised by the
proteasome, followed by rapid irreversible degradation.
Nucleosomes comprise the repeated units of chromosomal DNAs wrapped around histone octarmers that
consist of two sets of each of H2A/H2B and H3/H4
dimer. As DNA replication proceeds, new nucleosomes
are formed. Thus, the timing of histone synthesis and
DNA replication is coupled, by which newly synthesised
histones are rapidly deposited onto replicated DNA [3].

In yeast, previous reports showed that increased histone
levels lead to chromosome instability [4] and enhanced
DNA-damage sensitivity [5]. Chromosomal instability
has been recognised as a hallmark of human cancer [6,7].
However, how the cellular amount of histones is regulated is largely unknown at the molecular levels.
Proper chromosome segregation requires a physical
connection between spindle microtubules and centromeric DNAs and this attachment occurs via the kinetochore. CENP-A is a centromere-specific histone H3
variant that is essential for kinetochore formation.
CENP-A represents the most likely candidate for the epigenetic mark responsible for maintenance of centromere
identity [8,9]. Several recent studies have identified proteins specifically involved in CENP-A loading and centromeric nucleosome formation [10-16]. Interestingly, the
cell cycle regulated GATA-type transcription factor,
Ams2 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe that is required for
activation of S-phase specific core histone transcription
[17], also promotes the centromeric localisation of
CENP-A [18,19]. Ams2 protein levels accumulate at G1-S
phase, which is regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway [20,21]. In this commentary we describe our
recent work on the molecular mechanisms of how Ams2
levels are regulated throughout the cell cycle and the del-

eterious consequences when this intricate system goes
wrong.

Discussion
Ams2 ensures a cell cycle-specific transcriptional spike of
core histone gene expression

Ams2 was originally identified as one of the multicopy
suppressors of the temperature sensitive (ts) cnp1-1
mutant [19], defective in the centromere-specific histone
H3 variant CENP-A [22]. Interestingly genomic
sequences encompassing canonical histone H4 genes
were also isolated as other multicopy suppressors from
the same screening. This raised the possibility that Ams2
could be involved in transcriptional control of histone
genes. Indeed Ams2 is a member of the GATA factors
containing Daxx and zinc finger DNA binding motifs
(Figure 1A).
Subsequent analysis explicitly showed that Ams2 is a
major, if not the sole, transcription factor required for the
S-phase specific transcriptional spike of all of the core
histone genes [17]. Ams2 directly binds a consensus
"AACCCT-box" that exists in the 5' franking regions of
these histone genes. Note that cnp1+ is not regulated by
Ams2 nor does it contain the "AACCCT-box" in its promoter region. A genome-wide search for the "AACCCT"
motif followed by binding experiments suggested that
core histone genes would be the major, if not the sole, targets of Ams2 (note that only one gene, SPAC631.02
encoding a conserved bromodomain protein, contains
the "AACCCT-box" in its 5' flanking region, to which
Ams2 binds [17]).

Page 2 of 9

In the absence of Ams2, transcriptional activation of
histone genes does not occur during S phase, leading to
very low levels of histone transcription throughout the
cell cycle [17]. Cells with deletion of ams2+ manage to
divide, but exhibit a number of defective phenotypes,
including slower growth and frequent chromosome missegregation [19].
Ams2 protein shows cell cycle-dependent oscillation due to
varied protein stability

In parallel with a spike of histone gene expression, Ams2
protein accumulates in the nucleus at S phase [17,19]. In
sharp contrast, little, if any of this protein is detected during mid G2 and M phase (see Figure 1B). That is, Ams2
protein appears to disappear from cells upon completion
of S phase or at the beginning of G2 phase. ams2+ transcription is upregulated from G1 to S phase, which is
consistent with Ams2 protein accumulation during this
period. However, this does not account for the rapid disappearance of Ams2 protein after S phase. Instead, this
suggests the sudden destabilisation of Ams2 in G2 phase.
Indeed the Ams2 protein is unstable and rapidly
degraded at G2 and M phase (half-life ~20 min), but is
markedly stabilised in S phase (half-life > 60 min). In G1
cells, the Ams2 is degraded, although at a much slower
rate (half-life ~40 min). In summary, the Ams2 protein is
unstable during G2 and M phase, partially stabilised in
G1, and stable in S phase. Changes in protein stability
coupled with transcriptional regulation, therefore,
account for oscillations of Ams2 levels during the cell
cycle.
Ams2 protein is degraded via the SCFPof3-proteasome
pathway

Figure 1 Ams2 is a cell cycle-regulated GATA type transcription
factor. (A) Schematic structure of Ams2. Structural domains homologous to Daxx (green), amino acid stretches rich in arginine and lysine
(magenta) and zinc finger motif (blue) are depicted. Amino acid residues surrounding the phosphorylation sites (asterisks) (which are mutated to alanine in M2 and M3 mutants) and CDK phosphorylation
consensus motifs (underlined) are also shown. (B) Fluctuation of Ams2
protein levels during the cell cycle. Wild-type cells were synchronised
by centrifugal elutriation. The protein or RNA samples collected every
15 min were assayed by western (anti-Ams2, Ams2 W.B) or northern
blotting (histone H4, Histone N.B).

Regulation of protein stability through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is a key mechanism underlying various
cellular processes [1]. To address the involvement of this
pathway in Ams2 stability, we examined the half-life of
this protein in proteasome mutants. As suspected, Ams2
degradation during G2 phase was substantially suppressed, which was accompanied by massive accumulation of ubiquitylated Ams2.
There are two ubiquitin ligases that regulate cell cycle
progression, Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome
(APC/C) and Skp1-Cdc53/Cullin-1-F-box (SCF) [23,24].
As described earlier, Ams2 protein is rapidly degraded in
G2 phase. We posited that APC/C is unlikely to be
involved, as this ubiquitin ligase should be inactive at G2
phase, when Ams2 is degraded. This raised the possibility
that the SCF is responsible. Subsequent analysis showed
that this is in fact the case.
SCF consists of various subcomplexes, each of which
contains different F-box proteins, components responsible for binding specific substrates. Our previous work

and that from other laboratories showed that fission yeast
contains 18 F-box proteins [25-27] (see Table 1). Three of
these F-box proteins, Pop1, Pop2 and Pof3, play crucial
roles in cell cycle progression and coordination [28-34].
Half-life analysis using individual mutants showed that
the Ams2 protein was stabilised in the pof3 deletion
mutant, but not in pop1 or pop2 mutants. Furthermore,
Pof3 did bound to Ams2, substantiating the suggestion
that SCFPof3 is an E3 ligase responsible for degradation of
Ams2.
Cdc7 homologue Hsk1 is a kinase responsible for Ams2
degradation

F-box proteins normally recognise phosphorylated substrates [35]. Indeed, Ams2 protein shows a cell cycle-specific band-shift on gel electrophoresis, in which a faster
migrating form appears coincident with a peak of histone
gene expression (Figure 1B). This faster form is then
replaced by slower phosphorylated forms, followed by
abrupt disappearance [17]. Half-life measurements of
Ams2 using various cdc mutants showed that Cdk1/Cdc2
is not required for Ams2 instability (see below for
details). As Ams2 phosphorylation occurs in S-phase, we
examined the involvement of the S-phase kinase DDK

(Dbf4-dependent protein kinase, Cdc7 in budding yeast
and Hsk1 in fission yeast). In the hsk1 mutant, Ams2 is
hypo-phosphorylated and highly stabilised. This result
suggested that Hsk1-DDK is a kinase responsible for Sphase phosphorylation of Ams2, which leads to SCFPof3mediated proteolysis (see Figure 2 for scheme).
Potential cooperative roles between CDK and DDK in Ams2
proteolysis

In vitro kinase reaction showed that Ams2 is a substrate
of Hsk1. Several subsequent experimentations narrowed
down potential phosphorylation sites to three residues
(586T, 599S and 601S, Figure 1A, asterisks). Mutagenesis
analysis of these sites (M2, M3 and M2&M3 in Figure 1A)
indicated that 599S and 601S are phosphorylated by
Hsk1-Dfp1 in vitro. Expression of individual mutants in
fission yeast, followed by half-life analysis, supported that
these threonine and serines are required for Ams2 phosphorylation and subsequent proteolysis.
It is notable that when a phospho mutant, i.e., a stable
form of Ams2 (M2&M3), is expressed from its native promoter, its mRNA levels are slightly but reproducibly
decreased compared to those of wild-type Ams2. This
result indicates that some monitoring system, possibly a

*Assignment of some F-box proteins (Pof6, Pof8, Pof12 and Pof13) as 'non-SCF' is based upon the fact that these F-box proteins, albeit binding
Skp1, do not have the conserved proline residue within the F-box motif that is critical for direct interaction between F-box and Cullin-1 [59]. In
fact, binding experiments showed this is the case [51]. The only exception is Pof9, which does not contain the proline residue, but it acts as a
component of SCF.

Figure 2 A model for the mechanism of Ams2 protein oscillation. Ams2 binds 5' flanking regions of core histone genes, thereby activating histone

feedback mechanism, would operate in maintaining the
proper cellular levels of histone and/or Ams2. Further
studies are necessary to uncover the identity of this regulatory loop.
Intriguingly, two sites of the above three residues are
within the CDK consensus (586TPPK589 and
601SPWR604, Figure 1A, underlined). As described earlier, our stability data, however, suggested that Cdc2/
Cdk1 is not required for mobility shift of Ams2 phosphorylation or degradation. How could this apparent discrepancy be explained and what is the relationship between
CDK consensus sites and DDK? Here, we posit two scenarios. One is that Hsk1 is capable of phosphorylating
CDK consensus sites that are found in Ams2. As consensus phosphorylation sites for DDK remain to be determined, this notion cannot be ruled out. Another
possibility, which is more appealing, is that CDK and
DDK act in concert for Ams2 phosphorylation. According to this scenario, CDK would phosphorylate T586 and
S601, thereby promoting subsequent S599 phosphorylation by Hsk1. Despite this, Cdc2-dependent phosphorylation may not be absolutely essential as far as activation of
Hsk1 and phosphorylation of S599 and/or S601. It is
tempting to speculate that CDK may play a role in Ams2
phosphorylation as a priming kinase for DDK, although
this needs further scrutiny. It is also possible that in addition to ubiquitylation and degradation, individual phosphorylation by CDK and DDK could make distinct
contributions toward Ams2 function, such as nuclear
localisation and chromatin binding (see below). Further
biochemical analysis will be necessary to draw solid conclusions regarding this issue.
Spatiotemporal control of Ams2 stability during S phase

Ams2 proteolysis requires phosphorylation by DDK,
which is active during S phase. However, as shown in Figure 3A, Ams2, both soluble and insoluble (chromatinbound), is stable when cells are arrested at S phase with
HU treatment. How can we reconcile this result? Interestingly, once released from HU block, Ams2, which is

bound on chromatin, is stable, whereas phospho-Ams2 in
the soluble fraction is selectively degraded (Figure 3A and
3B). Perhaps during early S phase or when DNA structure
checkpoint is activated (triggered by HU treatment), Pof3
may be prevented from accessing phospho-Ams2. As S
phase proceeds further, only soluble Ams2 is capable of
interacting with Pof3, but chromatin-bound Ams2 is still
not. We postulated that Ams2 stability is regulated in a
dual manner, temporally via S-phase progression and
spatially via its DNA/chromatin binding activity, which
may be dependent on accessibility of SCFPof3 to Ams2.
Centromeric nucleosomes are compromised by
constitutive histone synthesis

As described earlier, histone synthesis is under strict cell
cycle control through Ams2. It would be thus of particular interest to see the physiological effects derived from
constitutive Ams2 expression. Intriguingly, several
expected and unexpected phenotypic consequences have
been observed. It may not be surprising that excess Ams2
is harmful for cell growth with induced chromosome loss.
This detrimental effect is exaggerated in the presence of
the hsk1 mutation, consistent with the fact that this
mutant already has increased levels of histones ascribable
to Ams2 stabilisation.
It is unexpected that chromatin architectures at the
core centromere are dramatically altered. Micrococcal
nuclease (MNase) experiments showed that the core centromere region, which normally exhibits non-structured
patterns (smears with MNase digestion), was almost
indistinguishable from that in other euchromatin regions,
namely regular ladder patterns. This indicates that structural compositions of histones in this core centromere
region may be altered by Ams2 overproduction. Indeed,
in these Ams2-overproducing cells, a substantial amount
of H3 histones is incorporated into the centromere. It is
important to note that in these cells CENP-ACnp1 still
exists at the core centromere as in wild-type. That is, the
number of nucleosomes is increased, in which
nucleosomes comprising canonical H3 or CENP-ACnp1

Figure 3 Molecular behaviour of Ams2 throughout S phase. (A) Chromatin fractionation assay. Wild-type cells were arrested with HU (arrest) and
released into the HU-free fresh medium for 15 min (release). Whole-cell extracts (W) were spun and separated into soluble supernatant (S) and chromatin-bound pellet (P). Western blotting was performed with anti-Ams2 antibody. (B) A speculative model for spatial and temporal regulation of Ams2
during S and G2 phase. Early replication origins are activated in the presence of HU (fire), whereas the firing of late origins is blocked. During this period,
DDK has high kinase activity, and thereby Ams2 proteins become phosphorylated, although Ams2 is stable. When cells are released from HU arrest,
phosphorylated Ams2 is still detected only on chromatin, in which the chromatin-free phosphorylated fraction may be degraded via SCFPof3. As DNA
replication progresses further and completes (G2), SCFPof3 may be able to interact with chromatin-bound phosphorylated Ams2. (see text for details)

appear to coexist in the core centromere, leading to formation of more tightly packed nucleosomes in this
region. Perhaps this abnormal centromere status would
be the reason, at least in part, for growth arrest and massive chromosome loss phenotypes. Analysis of euchromatin (e.g., around the actin gene) in Ams2-overproducing
cells also indicates that the overall number of
nucleosomes is increased. In summary, induced overexpression of all the core histone genes forces formation of
more nucleosomes on both euchromatin and centromere
regions.
These results indicate that despite the existence of multiple mechanisms by which to ensure the formation of
centromere-specific nucleosomes [10-16], overproduction of a single transcription factor, Ams2, is sufficient to

interfere with these regulatory networks. We envisage
that this edge of wall status of histone homeostasis is
indeed the reason that fission yeast has developed DDKphosphorylation- and SCF-mediated proteolysis of Ams2
during the cell cycle. It would be interesting to address
other defects except at the centromere in Ams2-overexpressing cells.
Evolutionary conservation of histone homeostasis from
yeast to human

Are the mechanisms underlying cell cycle-dependent histone homeostasis conserved? The Ams2 protein, however, seems not to be conserved in other species, which
may suggest that what we have found is a fission yeastspecific regulatory system. Nonetheless as described

Takayama and Toda Cell Division 2010, 5:18

below, we envision that although individual organisms
have developed different strategies to maintain a proper
level of histones, they implement the universal regulatory
system, that is, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
In budding yeast, histone levels, in particular those of
non-chromatin forms, are regulated by phosphorylation
and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [36]. In this regulatory system, excess free histones are phosphorylated by
Rad53 (homologues of fission yeast Cds1 and human
CHK1/2), resulting in polyubiquitylation via the Ubc4/
Ubc5 (E2) and Tom1 (E3) and subsequent degradation by
the proteasome (Figure 4, right). Although not shown in
fission yeast, it is noteworthy that in budding yeast and
fly, CENP-A protein levels are strictly regulated by the
ubiquitin-proteasome system [37,38]. Therefore, at least
in yeast, the histone levels are under the control of phosphorylation and the ubiquitin-proteasome system.

In mammalian cells, unlike yeast or plants, the 3' ends
of histone mRNAs contain a stem-loop structure. This
specific structure is recognised by stem-loop binding
protein (SLBP), by which mRNA half-life is determined.
Interestingly, SLBP is synthesised at S phase and is rapidly
degraded at the end of S phase. Furthermore, SLBP degradation is triggered by phosphorylation through CDKcyclinA (Figure 4, left) [21,39]. However, the molecular
basis of SLPB degradation is not known. Given the degradation of fission yeast Ams2 and budding yeast free histones, we envisage that SLBP is degraded via the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Hence, although the
molecular details of regulatory systems may not be the
same among individual species, the underlying principles
as to how histone homeostasis is maintain via ubiquitinmediated proteolysis would be conserved from yeast to
human beings.

Figure 4 General view of the species-specific regulation of histone homeostasis. In mammals (left) [45], histone transcription is activated by
NPAT (Nuclear protein, ataxia-telangiectasia locus) and SLBP is then bound to the 3' end of histone mRNA, by which it prevents degradation of mRNAs,
resulting in synthesis of histone proteins. At the end of S phase, CDK1-cyclinA (cycA) phosphorylates SLBP to trigger its degradation, restraining further
transcription of histone mRNAs. In fission yeast (middle) [20], Ams2 activates histone transcription at G1/S phase. At the S/G2 phase, Ams2 is phosphorylated by DDK, leading to degradation via the SCFPof3-ubiquitin proteasome pathway. In budding yeast (left) [36], excess histones are recognised
and phosphorylated by Rad53. The histone-Rad53 complex is recognised by the Ubc4/5 (E2) and Tom1 (E3) and is polyubiquitylated. Histones with a
polyubiquitin chain are degraded by the proteasome.

Concluding remarks

Through the pioneering work of Hartwell and colleagues
[4], it is known that ectopic expression of core histone
genes has a deleterious effect on chromosome transmission fidelity. However, the underlying mechanism of this
toxicity has remained a mystery for decades. We have
shown that in fission yeast the levels of the Ams2 transcription factor, which is responsible for periodic histone
gene expression, are regulated via the SCFPof3 ubiquitinproteasome pathway and that Ams2 proteolysis plays a
critical role in maintaining chromosome stability. Importantly, constitutive synthesis of Ams2, and therefore
excess core histones, results in structural alterations of
centromeric nucleosomes. Our study, therefore, provides
the first clear answer to the above question--this is at
least in part ascribable to the impairment of centromere
structure and function.
Our work illuminates interesting, unexpected parallels
between CDK and DDK during the cell cycle, in particular their roles during G2 phase. It is well established that
CDK is important to prevent re-replication of chromosomes upon completion of S phase [40]. In contrast, it is
generally believed that DDK's major, if not sole, role lies
in S phase, although previous work in yeast indicated that
this might not always be true [41,42]. Our study clearly
showed that DDK is needed to degrade Ams2 during G2
phase, thereby preventing unnecessary histone gene
expression during the post-S phase period. Hence, CDK
and DDK not only share roles in S phase initiation and
progression, but are also required to secure proper passage of G2 phase upon completion of S phase. CDK is
required for restraining deleterious re-replication of the
genome, whereas DDK prevents extra histone transcription, which would result in global and local genome disturbance, including centromere malfunction (Figure 5).

Page 7 of 9

Cooperative action between CDK and DDK is consistent with their structural and regulatory framework. Both
kinases consist of catalytic and regulatory subunits, in
which their regulatory subunits play a decisive role in
kinase activities, localisation and substrate recognition.
Intriguingly, the levels of cyclins (for CDK) and Dbf4/
Dfp1 (for DDK) are under the control of the APC/C ubiquitin ligase [43,44]. Although phylogenetically neither
catalytic nor regulatory subunit of CDK and DDK is evolutionarily close, common regulatory mechanisms suggest that CDK and DDK are, at least functionally, much
more intimate and cooperative than currently thought.
