Statistical method on nonrandom clustering with
application to somatic mutations in cancer

Abstract
Background: Human cancer is caused by the accumulation of tumor-specific mutations in oncogenes and tumor
suppressors that confer a selective growth advantage to cells. As a consequence of genomic instability and high
levels of proliferation, many passenger mutations that do not contribute to the cancer phenotype arise alongside
mutations that drive oncogenesis. While several approaches have been developed to separate driver mutations
from passengers, few approaches can specifically identify activating driver mutations in oncogenes, which are more
amenable for pharmacological intervention.
Results: We propose a new statistical method for detecting activating mutations in cancer by identifying
nonrandom clusters of amino acid mutations in protein sequences. A probability model is derived using order
statistics assuming that the location of amino acid mutations on a protein follows a uniform distribution. Our
statistical measure is the differences between pair-wise order statistics, which is equivalent to the size of an amino
acid mutation cluster, and the probabilities are derived from exact and approximate distributions of the statistical
measure. Using data in the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database, we have demonstrated
that our method detects well-known clusters of activating mutations in KRAS, BRAF, PI3K, and b-catenin. The
method can also identify new cancer targets as well as gain-of-function mutations in tumor suppressors.
Conclusions: Our proposed method is useful to discover activating driver mutations in cancer by identifying
nonrandom clusters of somatic amino acid mutations in protein sequences.

Background
Cancer is a genetic disease caused by the accumulation
of tumor-specific (somatic) mutations in two broadly
defined types of genes called tumor suppressors and
oncogenes (Vogelstein and Kinzler (2004) [1]). In general, mutations in tumor suppressors tend to inactivate
these natural repressors of tumorgenesis. Mutations in
cellular proto-oncogenes, on the other hand, typically
increase or deregulate the activity of their protein products. The existence of different types of genes and
mutations in cancer has significant practical implications
for developing targeted therapies in cancer care. So far,
pharmacological restoration of tumor suppression function has been challenging: better success has been
achieved by inhibiting activated oncogenes (Weinstein
and Joe (2006) [2]). In addition to representing potential
therapeutic targets, activating mutations can also be

used as biomarkers to identify populations likely to
respond to therapies targeting the mutated genes. There
is therefore significant interest in identifying those
mutations necessary for the cancer phenotype (also
known as driver mutations), separating the driver mutations from the random (passenger) mutations that occur
as a consequence of the genetic instability typical for
human tumors (Cahill et al. (1999) [3]), and furthermore
distinguishing activating mutations from inactivating
mutations.
Several methods have been developed for the automated prediction of driver oncogenic mutations in individual genes, yet few are suitable for detecting activating
mutations. The most straightforward method predicts
that driver mutations have a large number of mutations
relative to the estimated background mutational rate,
after normalizing for gene size (Wang et al. (2002) [4];
see also the “Standard test” in supplementary information for Ding et al. (2008) [5]). Another popular
approach predicts that driver mutations have a higher

frequency of non-synonymous mutations relative to the
background mutation rate (e.g. Bardelli et al. (2003) [6];
Yang et al. (2003) [7]; Samuels et al. (2004) [8]; Davies
et al. (2005) [9]; Greenman et al. (2006) [10]; Sjöblom et
al. (2006) [11]). These methods are typically used to
estimate the total fraction of driver mutations or to
detect driver genes, but like predictions based on the
phylogenic conservation of protein sequences (see
Kaminker et al (2007) [12] and refs. therein), they cannot distinguish between inactivating and activating
mutations. In addition, these methods are less suitable
to identify driver genes that have low mutation frequencies. Meanwhile, approaches that model the destabilizing
effects of mutations on protein structure (see Yip et al.
(2006) [13] and refs. therein) are more suitable for
tumor suppressor genes. Perhaps the most reliable
approach is to classify mutations based on prior knowledge from functional studies, but functional information
is by definition not available for novel or poorly characterized genes.
We propose an alternative approach to detect activating mutations in oncogenes, based on the hypothesis
that only a small number of specific mutations can activate a protein. To be precise, we hypothesize that a
localized cluster of amion acid mutations within a protein sequence, especially in the absence of obvious
mutational hotspots, is a fingerprint of selection for the
oncogenic phenotype associated with activating driver
mutations. Evolutionary studies demonstrate that most
amino acids replacements are either neutral or incompatible with protein function (Graur and Li (2000) [14]).
Thus, activating mutations should concentrate in a
small subset of protein positions and domains, while
passenger mutations can be distributed more evenly
along the protein sequence reflecting random chance
and differences in the mutability of individual DNA
codons. Consistent with this hypothesis, activating
somatic amino acid mutations cluster in protein kinases
(e.g. Bardelli et al. (2003) [6]; Samuels. (2004) [8]; Torkamani and Schork (2008) [15]).
Several methods in the statistics literature can be
applied to detect mutation clusters. For example, Naus
(1965) [16] proposed a statistical test for the maximum
number of points in a fixed length cluster on a line, and
developed the probability and expectation. Shortly thereafter, Naus (1966) [17] compared the power of two nonrandom clustering tests on a line; one test is the
maximum number of points in a fixed-length non-overlapping interval (e.g. 1 to p, p+1 to 2p, etc. for window
length p) and another is the maximum number of
points in a fixed-length running interval (e.g. 1 to p, 2
to p+1, etc.), which is also called scan statistics. Scan
statistics were further developed and applied by Balakrishnan and Koutras (2002) [18], and Glaz and Zhang

Page 2 of 9

(2006) [19] generalized the fixed-length restriction to
allow variable-length intervals by determining the maximum of a series of scan statistics each with a fixed window length. While Naus’s approach and scan statistics
with fixed or variable window lengths are useful, a
further generalization to an arbitrary number of points
in the interval is more flexible and useful to identify
activating driver mutations.
In this work a new statistics method is introduced that
identifies nonrandom mutation clustering without specifying the number of mutations or the cluster length.
The exact and approximate distribution of the statistical
measure is derived and a nonrandom mutation clustering (NMC) algorithm is developed based on the measure. We confirmed the utility of this approach by
detecting well-known activating mutations in KRAS,
BRAF, PI3K, and b-catenin oncogenes, as well as gainof-function mutations in several tumor suppressors.

Results
Data Description

Data used in this study are from COSMIC (Catalog of
Somatic Mutations in Cancer) database version 40 (Forbes et al (2008) [20]) via http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic. To ensure compatibility with the test assumption
that the location of amino acid mutations on a protein
follows a uniform distribution, we limit our analysis to
studies annotated as whole gene screens in COSMIC;
this eliminated a great majority of COSMIC studies
annotated as partial or with missing information on the
full-gene screen status. Furthermore, the cluster analysis
is restricted to missense mutations: nonsense and
synonymous changes are excluded. We limited our
search to confirmed somatic variants or mutations that
were reported in other studies as somatic. Finally, we
removed redundancy in mutations in cancer cell lines,
since cell line mutations are often reported by several
independent studies.
Nonrandom clusters in cancer genes

Using the NMC algorithm (see Methods), 12 different
proteins out of 446 contain nonrandom amino acid
mutation clusters with cutoff probability of less than
0.05, with the most significant clusters listed in Table 1
(probability < 0.01). The clusters include well-known
mutation hotspots in classical oncogenes such as BRAF,
RAS genes, PI3K, ERBB2/Her2, and CTNNB1/b-catenin.
Interestingly, nonrandom amino acid mutation clusters
were also identified in genes not considered to be classical oncogenes and even a few tumor suppressors. Interpretation of selected positive controls is described below
in more detail.

For most genes in Table 1, multiple significant amino
acid clusters were found, with the most significant clusters in sites of well-known oncogenic mutations. Interestingly, the great majority of the mutation-hotspots are
not in CpG positions (Table 2) suggesting that selection
and not the underlying mutation rate drives these
changes in tumors.

In addition to known clusters of activating mutations in
major oncogenes, several other genes have significant
mutation hot-spots. For example, two mutations
between the Roc (Ras of complex proteins) and kinase
domains in the LRRK2 locus form a significant cluster.
The LRRK2 kinase, also known as PARK8, is not considered to be a classical cancer gene. It most closely
resembles the family of tyrosine-like kinases that phosphorylate serine/threonine residues and lies upstream of
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways
(Mata et al. (2006) [26]). Interestingly, germline polymorphisms in LRRK2 predispose affected individuals to
Parkinson disease and are linked to specific cancer types
(Inzelberg and Jankovic (2007) [27]; Strongosky et al.
(2008) [28]).
As expected, we found fewer significant mutation hotspots in tumor suppressors, and these hot-spots were
typically much larger than those associated with oncogenes. In general, inactivating amino acid mutations are
not expected to form localized nonrandom clusters, but
rather to span many residues in highly conserved
regions (e.g. Nigro et al. (1989) [29]). The most significant cluster identified in TP53/p53 spans residues 132286, one of the four major p53 mutation hotspots that
are highly conserved in vertebrates (Nigro et al. (1989)
[29]). It overlaps the original major hotspot in residues
110-307 identified by Hollstein et al. (1991) [30], and
spans two shorter hotspots that include gain-of-function
mutations in positions 248 and 273 (Song et al. (2007)
[31]). Structural analysis demonstrates that both regions
are close together in the folded protein (Figure 2). The
cluster found in the phosphatase and tensin-homology
domains of PTEN includes residues known to inhibit
PTEN phosphatase activity (Tolkacheva and Chan
(2000) [32]), and sequence conservation cannot explain
this clustering since most of the PTEN protein is well
conserved among vertebrates (Yu et al. (2001) [33]).
These examples demonstrate that tumor suppressor
activity can be muted by changes in protein function in
addition to gene deletions or disruption of the reading
frame.

KRAS, CTNNB1/b-catenin, PI3K, and ERBB2 oncogenes. As expected, the most significant hotspot in
BRAF was amino acid residue 600 and represents the
well-known, highly oncogenic V600E mutation (Davies
et al. (2002) [21]). Similarly, RAS residues 12, 13, and 61
are known to be frequently mutated in tumors (see Bos
(1988) [22] for review). Residues 33, 34, 37, 41, and 45
were identified as a significant cluster in CTNNB1/bcatenin. There is a clear mechanistic rationale: residues
33, 37 and 41 are phosphorylated directly by GSK-3 b
while residue 45 has been reported to be a primer site
that is phosphorylated by CK1 (Hagen and Vidal-Puig
(2002) [23]): mutations at these positions prevent GSK-3
b-mediated degradation of b-catenin (Morin et al.
(1997) [24]). Residues 542-546 surround the 545 hotspot
in the helical domain of PI3K/PIK3CA (Samuels et al.
(2004) [8]), with a second significant PI3K cluster in the
kinase domain (positions 1025-1049; probability 2.60E20; Figure 1). Mutation of Glycine 766 in ERBB2 has

Discussion and Conclusions
A new method for the identification of nonrandom
mutation clusters in biological sequences is presented.
The method is fast, robust, and unlike many previous
methods, it is does not require a fixed window length,
which enables the identification of significant clusters of
variable sizes, particularly important for the detection of
activating mutations. We have applied this method to
investigate somatic amino acid mutations in the COSMIC database. Our method detected very short clusters
spanning a few individual amino acid positions in the
case of the oncogenes BRAF or KRAS, as well as larger
regions in the tumor suppressors p53 and PTEN.
A recent paper by Wagner (2007) [34] proposed two
similar approaches using the distance between mutation
positions. In the first approach, a Poisson distribution
was utilized to model mutation clusters. The test on the
distance of mutation positions containing k mutations
was derived and the minimum k that gives significance
was determined. The second approach assumed a uniform hypothesis and used permutation testing for significance. The permutation test is an approximation whose
precision depends on the number of permutations
undertaken, which can be very computationally intensive
for good accuracy and precision. By comparison, our

measure on distance is based on a uniform distribution
and is calculated directly via order statistics.
Our method has several potential limitations. First of
all, the status of all coding positions must be determined. This is primarily a limitation for older studies,
where typically only those exons with known mutations
were screened. However, with the explosion of largescale cancer genome sequencing (e.g. Sjöblom et al.
(2006) [11]; Greenman et al (2007) [10]; Jones et al.
(2008) [35]; Parsons et al. (2008) [36]; Cancer Genome
Atlas Research Network. (2008) [37]), the number of
studies suitable for analysis by NMC will grow. Another
limitation is our assumption that the mutation probability is uniform: hypermutable positions for both germline
and somatic mutations have been reported. As a result,
we have excluded all insertions and deletions, since
these mutations have strong sequence-dependence, and
restricted analysis to single-point amino acid substitutions. Examples of single point mutation hotspots are
CpG dinucleotides, which in unselected genomic
sequences have more than ten-fold higher mutation frequency compared to other dinucleotides (Sved and Bird
(1990) [38]). CpG hypermutability has been also
reported in certain tumors (Jones et al. (1992) [39]).
However, as shown in Table 2, only a few of the activating mutations identified by the NMC algorithm are in

sequences. Unlike previous approaches, the method
does not use fixed length windows and therefore can be
used to detect clusters of highly variable sizes. We
demonstrated the value of this method to detect activating amino acid mutations in human tumors and confirmed nonrandom clustering of well-known oncogenic
mutations in several classical oncogenes. The method
can be also used to discover new oncogenes from largescale cancer genome data and to identify gain-of-function mutations in tumor suppressors. Finally, detection
of nonrandom sequence changes is a general problem
and the method may be useful in other areas such as
DNA polymorphism analysis and comparative evolutionary studies (Wagner (2007) [34]).

CpG sites. Another potential bias can be introduced by
an unequal rate of mutagenesis caused by deficient
repair of DNA damage in cells and environmental mutagens. For instance, tobacco smoke preferentially induces
G to T transversions in DNA in lung cancer while colorectal tumors exhibit more transitions than transversions (Hollstein et al. (1991) [30]). Yet, despite the fact
that lung and colorectal tumors have different mutational spectra, essentially all KRAS mutations in these
tumors occur in residues 12, 13, and 61. In summary,
while our analysis is affected by nonrandom factors such
as the presence of mutation hotspots or exposure to different mutagens, positive selection for a cancer phenotype appears to be the major cause of mutation
clustering.
The aim of the method is to detect activating mutations that are assumed to be concentrated in specific
amino acid positions. Activating mutations are typical
for cellular proto-oncogenes and, as expected, significant
clusters are detected in oncogenes such as BRAF, RAS
genes, CTNNB1/b-catenin, or PI3K. Less intuitive, however, are positively selected residues in the p53 and
PTEN tumor suppressors. Previous reports revealed that
these genes encode functional domains that can result
in gain-of-(non-suppressor)-function when altered by
mutation. Thus, our method may also identify positive
selection on mutations that alter the repressive function
of tumor suppressors.
In conclusion, we propose a new method for discovering nonrandom clusters of mutations in biological

Methods
Single amino acid mutations may lead to changes in
protein function. Because missense mutations are the
most likely single-point genetic mutation to have an
effect on protein function, the nonrandom mutation
clustering (NMC) algorithm is applied to missense
mutations in individual genes in this work.
The NMC algorithm is derived under the following
assumptions: 1. each amino acid residue in a protein
sequence has equal mutation probability; 2. mutations
between amino acid positions are independent; 3. mutations between samples are independent; and 4. the number of potentially available samples is larger than the
number of mutations.
Denote N as the protein sequence length and n as the
total number of mutations in the protein. Denote Xi, a
random variable between 1 and N, to be the position of
the ith non-synonymous (missense) mutation. By
assumption, the mutations follow a discrete uniform distribution, and the n mutations are equivalent to n independent sample draws with replacement from the
discrete uniform distribution, where the probability Pr
(Xi = j) = 1/N, where j = 1,..., N and i = 1,..., n.
By assumption, mutations are random and can occur
at the same position more than once. The data are
transferred into order statistics by ordering the Xi into
X (1) ≤...≤ X (i) ≤...≤ X (n) , where X (i) is the ith smallest
number in the sample, i = 1,..., n. To characterize clustering, the distance between order statistics Rki= X(k) - X
(i), for any pair i, k, i < k, i, k = 1, .., n is computed. We
develop the distribution of Rki, and declare the clustering to be nonrandom when the probability that the distance between order statistics R ki is less than a predefined significant probability level a: Pr(Rki ≤ r) ≤ a.
The probability Pr(Rki ≤ r) is the cumulative distribution
of Rki, the chance that the distance between order statistics X(i) and X(k) is as close or closer than r. Therefore,
the probability Pr(Rki ≤ r) is derived as a p-value, where
the probability a is an arbitrary level such as 0.01, 0.05,

Ye et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:11
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/11

or 0.1. The distance Rki has the simple interpretation of
the size of the mutation cluster.
1.1 Derivation of the distribution of statistical measure

While distributions of order statistics are usually derived
for continuous distributions, they have also been derived
for discrete distributions. Burr (1955) [40] derived the
distribution of range statistics using order statistics on a
discrete uniform distribution. Range statistics is a special
case of our statistical measure Rki, where i = 1 and k =
n. Evans et al. (2006) [41] developed the density function and cumulative distribution of the ith order statistics given an arbitrary discrete distribution, i = 1,..., n.
We extend the approach of Evans et al. (2006) [41] to
determine the distribution of the distance between order
statistics, and generalize the approach of Burr, I.W.
(1955) [40] to derive the distribution of statistics Rki.
The distribution of Rki is developed from the joint distribution of order statistics X(i) and X(k) for any pair i, k, i
< k, i, k = 1, .., n. Rki, the distance between order statistics
X(i) and X(k), can range from 0, which means both mutations are located at the same position, to N-1, which
means the mutations are on the first and last positions of
the protein sequence. Intermediate values between 0 and
N-1 are also possible, for example Rki = 1 implies that the
mutations are adjacent to each other and so on. We
develop the distribution of Rki for each possible scenario.
Rki = 0, for any pair i, k, i < k, i, k = 1, .., n, implies
that mutations X(i) and X(k) are located at the same position. Taking the N possible positions into consideration,
the probability that Rki = 0 is written as

= N. For1 <y <N, the distribution is derived as follows: there must be i-1 order statistics at position x,
where x ≤ y ; among those i-1 order statistics, there are
u order statistics where x <y and i-1-u with x = y, where
u can range from 0 to i-1. There must be k-i+1 order
statistics at position x = y. Finally, there must be n-k
order statistics at x, where x ≥ y; among those n-k order
statistics, there are v order statistics where x >y and n-kv where x = y, where v can range from 0 to n-k. Putting
all the terms together, there are u order statistics
located before position y, with probability (y - 1) N,
where u = 0,..., i-1; there are (k-i+1)+(i-1-u)+(n-k-v) =
n-u-v order statistics at y with probability1/N ; there are
v order statistics after position y, with probability1 - y/
N, where v = 0,..., n-k and x = 2,..., N-1.
For Rki = 1, for any pair i, k, i < k, i, k = 1, .., n, the
order statistics X(i) and X(k) are adjacent to each other.

The distribution is derived using the properties of
order statistics. For example, when y = X(i) = X(k) = 1,
the first k order statistics are on the first position and
the remaining n-k order statistics are on or above the
first position. Among these n-k order statistics, v order
statistics are located strictly above the first position,
with the remaining n-k-v order statistics at the first
position, where v can range from 0, meaning all n order
statistics are on the first position, to n-k, indicating that
all the remaining order statistics are strictly larger than
the first position. A similar logic applies to y = X(i) = X

The distributions for R ki = 1 and R ki = r derived
above, for any pair i, k, i < k, i, k = 1, .., n, r = 2,..., N-1,
is based on similar logic as Rki= 0. The i-1 order statistics must be located at or before position X(i), and the
n-k order statistics must be located at or after position
X(k). For the remaining k-i-1 order statistics, q order statistics are located at position X(i), t order statistics are
strictly between X(i) and X(k) and the remaining k-i-1-q-t
statistics are at position X(k), where q = 0,..., k-i-1 and t
= 0,..., k-i-1-q. Grouping all the terms together yields the
distribution equations for Rki = 1 and Rki = r, for any
pairs of i, k, i < k, i, k = 1, .., n, r = 2,..., N-1.
Finally, for the special case of i = 1 and k = n, the distribution of Rki may be simplified as

Note that Pr(Rn1 ≤ r) = 1 for r = N-1. The result is the
same as the range statistics reported in Burr, I.W. (1955)
[40].
1.2 Approximation of the distribution

The derivation in section 1.1 is the exact distribution of
the statistical measure for nonrandom mutation clustering in the discrete uniform distribution. Proteins typically contain hundreds or thousands of amino acids and
it is convenient to approximate the discrete uniform distribution with a continuous uniform distribution (0, 1)
because calculating the distribution of Rki = r can be
extremely slow when the length of the protein sequence
N or the number of mutations n is large, resulting in
dramatically increased iterations in those summations.
For computational efficiency, we now develop the distribution for the test statistics in the continuous limit.
When the n order statistics are random samples from
a uniform distribution (0, 1), the probability distribution
of order statistics X(i) and X(k), for any pair i, k, i < k, i,
k = 1, .., is:
Pr(R ki 

X (k)  X (i)
N

1 r

 (i 1)!(k i 1)!(n  k)! x
n!

i 1 k i 1

(1  ( x  r )) n  k dx

r

x 0

where distance is normalized to be in the range (0,1),
so the distance Rki = (X(k) - X(i))/N differs by the constant N from section 1.1, where R ki = X (k) - X (i) . The
cumulative distribution can be written as Pr(Rki ≤ r)
Pr(R ki  r )
r 1 y



  (i 1)!(k i 1)!(n  k)! x
n!

i 1 k i 1

which by iterated integration by parts gives:

n!
dy
(k  i 1)!(i  n  k)!

 Pr(Beta(y ; k  i, i  n  k  1)  r )

Using the continuous uniform distribution, Rki simply
follows a Beta distribution with parameters k-i and i + n
- k + 1, ensuring that Pr(Rki ≤ 1) = 1. This result was
reported in Johnson et al. (1995) [42] for a joint

Page 7 of 9

distribution of pair-wise order statistics following a continuous uniform distribution (0, 1).
1.3 Correction for multiple testing

For each pair-wise order statistic, the exact and continuous distributions can be calculated using formulas in
sections 1.1 and 1.2. Clusters are evaluated for each pair
of order statistics, which can elevate the false positive
rate due to multiple testing. A Bonferroni correction
can be chosen to correct the false positive rate because
it doesn’t require an independent hypotheses assumption and it is a conservative test. The false discovery
rate (FDR) developed by Benjamini and Hochberg
(1995) [43] is popular and has been applied to multiple
testing problems in many areas. Although it requires an
independent test statistics assumption, it is known to be
powerful and robust under positively correlated test statistics (Benjamini and Yekutieli (2001) [44]). Because of
its conservativeness, Bonferroni is applied as the default
to adjust multiple testing for the NMC algorithm and as
an alternative, FDR can be applied.
1.4 NMC algorithm

The exact and approximate distributions of distance
between pair-wise order statistics were derived in section
1.1 and 1.2. The calculation is rapid for the special case
when Rki is 0 or 1 or for the range statistics, and we use
the exact distribution derived in section 1.1 to ensure
accuracy for these cases. For further efficiency when calculating the distribution for Rki = 1, the algorithm is
stopped when the iterated summation in the distribution
reaches the significance level because the full summation
is larger than the partial summation and the difference
cannot be significant. The continuous distribution is used
for computational efficacy when the difference R ki is
greater than 1. The nonrandom mutation clustering
(NMC) algorithm is summarized in the following
procedure:
• Input: Number and location of missense mutations
in a protein
• Output: A table with columns of nonrandom mutation cluster size, starting location of the cluster, ending
location of the cluster, number of mutations observed in
the cluster and probability of the cluster that is significant after Bonferroni or FDR correction.
• NMC algorithm:
◦ Step 1: Reorder the mutation positions into order
statistics and set the significance level a. By default, a =
0.05.
◦ Step 2: For each pair-wise order statistics, calculate
the probability Pr(Rki ≤ r), for any pair i, k, i < k, i, k =
1, .., n. For R = 0 and 1 and/or i = 1 and k = n, use the
distribution in section 1.1. For r>1, use the distribution
in section 1.2.
◦ Step 3: Calculate the Bonferroni or FDR corrected
probabilities.

◦ Step 4: Report the multiple-testing corrected significant clusters in the output table after sorting from the
lowest probability to the highest.
