Differential expression pattern of an acidic
9/13-lipoxygenase in flower opening and
senescence and in leaf response to phloem
feeders in the tea plant
Shouan Liu1, Baoyu Han1,2*

Abstract
Background: Lipoxygenase (LOXs) is a large family of plant enzymes that catalyse the hydroperoxidation of free
polyunsaturated fatty acids into diverse biologically active compounds, collectively named phyto-oxylipins.
Although multiple isoforms of LOXs have been identified in a wide range of annual herbaceous plants, the genes
encoding these enzymes in perennial woody plants have not received as much attention. In Camellia sinensis (L.)
O. Kuntze, no LOX gene of any type has been isolated, and its possible role in tea plant development, senescence,
and defence reaction remains unknown. The present study describes the isolation, characterization, and expression
of the first tea plant LOX isoform, namely CsLOX1, and seeks to clarify the pattern of its expression in the plant’s
defence response as well as in flower opening and senescence.
Results: Based on amino acid sequence similarity to plant LOXs, a LOX was identified in tea plant and named
CsLOX1, which encodes a polypeptide comprising 861 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 97.8 kDa.
Heterologous expression in yeast analysis showed that CsLOX1 protein conferred a dual positional specificity since
it released both C-9 and C-13 oxidized products in equal proportion and hence was named 9/13-CsLOX1. The
purified recombinant CsLOX1 protein exhibited optimum catalytic activity at pH 3.6 and 25°C. Real-time
quantitative PCR analysis showed that CsLOX1 transcripts were detected predominantly in flowers, up-regulated
during petal senescence, and down-regulated during flower bud opening. In leaves, the gene was up-regulated
following injury or when treated with methyl jasmonate (MeJA), but salicylic acid (SA) did not induce such
response. The gene was also rapidly and highly induced following feeding by the tea green leafhopper Empoasca
vitis, whereas feeding by the tea aphid Toxoptera aurantii resulted in a pattern of alternating induction and
suppression.
Conclusions: Analysis of the isolation and expression of the LOX gene in tea plant indicates that the acidic CsLOX1
together with its primary and end products plays an important role in regulating cell death related to flower
senescence and the JA-related defensive reaction of the plant to phloem-feeders.

Background
Phyto-oxylipins, which are among the important active
components of plant cells, play diverse roles in several
physiological events including plant growth and development, senescence, and defence against pathogens and
pests as well as abiotic sources of stress [1,2]. Most

phyto-oxylipins are derived from the lipoxygenase
(LOX) pathway, which contains at least seven multienzyme branches. Of these enzymes, lipoxygenase is the
first step and a key enzyme. Plant LOX (linoleate: oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.13.11.12) is a large family of
non-heme iron-containing enzymes that catalyse the
addition of molecular oxygen to linoleic acid (C18:2)
and linolenic acid (C18:3) at either C9 or C13 position,
with 9S- or 13S-hydroperoxides as the primary product,
and hence are referred to as 9- or 13-LOX [1-3]. Plant

LOXs can be further divided into two gene subfamilies,
type 1 and type 2, based on the N-terminal chloroplast
transit peptide sequence. The type 1 subfamily lacks a
plasmid transit peptide and consists of both 9- and
13-LOXs, and the type 2 subfamily possesses 13-LOXs,
which have a chloroplast transit peptide [1]. Both 9Sand 13S-hydroperoxides are rapidly converted into a
series of biologically active molecules by the action of
the LOX pathway enzymes, and are therefore referred to
as phyto-oxylipins [1,2].
The highest LOX activity was observed in soybean
during leaf growth [4], and LOX activity level was
reported as being positively correlated with the rate of
elongation of an organ [5]. Potato LOX1 is expressed
during tuber growth, and its antisense suppression
resulted in smaller tubers [6]. Maize LOX3 (ZMLOX3)
knockout mutants showed shorter roots and increased
senescence [7]. The olive 9/13-LOX gene is predominantly expressed during fruit ripening and is believed to
be associated with senescence in the plant [8]. A similar
observation was made in kiwifruit LOXs [9]. Some
LOXs, such as r9-LOX1 and OsLOX1 in rice [10,11] and
PdLOX in almond [12], were found to be involved in
germination. However, there is little information on the
role of LOXs in flower bud opening and petal expansion. Physiological and biochemical analyses show that
lipid content changes and the cellular membrane is
degraded during flower senescence [13,14] and that lipid
oxidation is either due to increased LOX activity or
independent of LOX [15]. Increased LOX activity prior
to obvious senescence of flowers has been shown in
many plants including carnation [16], day lily [17], and
rose [18]. In Petunia inflata, a highly up-regulated allene
oxide synthase (AOS) gene involved in petal senescence
was identified and assumed to have a role in programmed cell death [19] whereas in Alstroemeria
peruviana and two orchid species, no increase in LOXspecific activity was observed over time [20,21]. It is
likely that the function of LOXs during petal senescence
varies from species to species [22] and needs further
study.
The expression LOX genes is most frequently
observed in the response of plants to pest attack, particularly that of many annual herbaceous plants to insects
[1,23]. Transcripts encoding LOX genes were strongly
induced during plant-aphid interactions including
Myzus euphorbiase feeding on tomato leaves [24] and
M. nicotianae sucking the sap from Nicotiana attenuata
[25]. The cabbage BoLOX was up-regulated by several
herbivores such as caterpillars (Pieris rapae, P. brassicae,
and Mamestra brassicae), spider mites (Tetranychus
urticae), and locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) but not by
aphids (M. persicae) [26]. In rice, two LOX genes are
involved in the plant’s response to stress brought about

by herbivores: the OsLOX1 transcript was rapidly and
abundantly induced by the brown planthopper (BPH)
Niaparvata lugens [11], and the OsHI-LOX, which was
expressed only slightly by BPH but strongly by a chewing insect, namely the striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo
suppressalis [27]. The antisense-mediated depletion of
LOX gene suggests that its role in plant defence varies
with the type of herbivore. Silencing the NaLOX3 made
N. attenuata unable to produce defensive compounds
and hence more susceptible to the chewing insect Manduca sexta [28]; however, in the field the transformed
plants are susceptible to many herbivores, including a
new opportunistic phloem-feeder, the leafhopper
Empoasca sp., which does not select the wild-type
N. attenuata [29]. Transgenic rice with sense or antisense OsLOX1 would increase or decrease the resistance
to BPH [11]. It is noteworthy that antisense expression
of rice OsHI-LOX encourages chewing herbivores but
deters the phloem-feeder [27]. LOX genes are less commonly observed in woody perennials than in herbaceous
annuals. The tea plant, being a perennial, is exposed to
pests for longer time and being larger, presents a greater
expanse for pests – a study of expression patterns of its
LOX genes in response to attack by herbivores therefore
assumes importance.
The tea plant, Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze, is not
only one of the world’s most important woody plantation crops but is also valued as a source of secondary
metabolic products including phyto-oxylipins. Tender
tea buds and leaves are usually plucked and processed
to produce high-grade tea as a beverage. Tea flowers
emit plenty of aromatic volatiles to attract bees and
wasps and have become a major source of honey [30].
However, tea is also attacked by herbivores such as tea
green leafhoppers and aphids. As a defence mechanism,
tea can emit specific volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) or change the relative proportions of many
components of the VOCs, which may attract predators
and parasites - natural enemies of the herbivores - to
keep the pests in check [31,32]. As the first step to elucidating the function of tea plant oxylipins in development and defence, we worked on isolating and
characterizing a tea plant LOX gene, namely CsLOX1.
Purification and biochemical analysis of the recombinant
protein showed that CsLOX1 is a dual position-specific
lipoxygenase producing both C-9 and C-13 HPOs. The
CsLOX1 was expressed predominantly in flowers, but
differentially regulated during flower opening and senescence. We also studied the dynamics of CsLOX1 expression patterns in leaves following mechanical wounding,
hormone treatment, and attack by two phloem-feeders
(tea green leafhopper and tea aphid) and the role of
CsLOX1 in flower development and defence against
insect attack.

Results
Isolation and sequence analysis of CsLOX1

To clone the C. sinensis lipoxygenase gene, three PCR
fragments were first amplified by RT-PCR reaction
using degenerate primers that correspond to the conserved amino acid sequences from other plant LOXs.
The resulting segments were 298 bp, 328 bp, and 544
bp long, and their sequences showed a high degree of
identity to lipoxygenase from other plants. The cDNA
ends were then amplified with 5’ and 3’ RACE-PCR.
Finally, the cDNA sequences were combined and validated by PCR amplification with the primers derived
from 5’ and 3’ RACE products. As this is the first lipoxygenase gene reported in the tea plant, the gene was
named CsLOX1 (Genbank: EU195885). The gene was
approximately 2796 bp long, comprising a 191 bp long
5’-untranslated region (UTR) and a 73 bp long 3’-UTR
with poly (A) signals, and contained an open reading
frame (ORF) of 2586 bp encoding a presumed translation product of 861 amino acids with an Mr of 97.8 kDa
and a pI of 5.74. Based on the BLAST P network service, the predicted amino acid sequence of CsLOX1
showed a high degree of identity with other plant LOXs
such as common olive (77.9%, Genbank: EU678670),
almond (77.2%, Genbank: AJ404331), potato (77%, Genbank: U60202), and hazelnut (76.9%, Genbank:
AJ417975), which belong to type 1, but the gene also
shared its identity to a small extent with LOX isoforms
from the type 2 group. Sequence analysis of CsLOX1
showed several functional domains typical of plant
LOXs: (a) the conserved domains involved in substrate
binding (“AWRTDEEFAREMLAG”, positions 361-375)
and oxygen binding ("ASALHAAVNFGQY”, 709-721),
(b) the highly conserved C-terminal amino acid
sequence ("GIPNSVSI”, 854-861), (c) the plant LOXs
position specificity motif for 9-LOX ("R/TV” at positions
730/579-580) (which was present at the active site, but
SP-HPLC analysis of recombinant CsLOX1 products
later indicated it to be a non-conventional LOX with 9/
13-LOX activity), (d) five highly conserved histidine residues, one each at positions 517, 522, 527, 545, and 554,
and (e) amino acid residues essential for the ability to
bind iron (His 517, His 527, His 713, Asn 717, and Ile
861) at the active site (Additional file 1).
The phylogenetic relationships among the deduced
amino acid sequences of CsLOX1 and those of other
reported plant LOXs were determined by constructing a
phylogenetic tree (Figure 1). Neighbour-joining analysis
identified two groups of plant LOX proteins that
appeared to reflect accurately their subcellular localization. LOXs were classified as follows: group I was found
in the chloroplast with chloroplast transit peptides at
the N-terminal and belonged to type 2 subfamily, and

Page 3 of 15

group II was found in the cytoplasm and belonged to
type 1 subfamily. CsLOX1 belongs to group II, type 1
gene family, and is predicted to be in the cytoplasm.
Other LOXs from group II, such as ZmLOX3 [7,33],
OsLOX1 [11], and PdLOX [12], are reported as being
involved in the defence mechanism, whereas olive LOX
is reported to be involved in fruit ripening and senescence [8].
Biochemical activity and characterization of recombinant
yeast CsLOX1

The ORF of CsLOX1 was cloned to multiple cloning
sites of the expression vector pPIC9K, and a recombinant plasmid, namely pPIC9K/lox1, was constructed.
The linearized plasmid pPIC9K/lox1 was then transformed to Pichia pastoris GS115 and over-expressed.
The CsLOX1 protein with biochemical activity was
synthesized and secreted to the culture medium when a
recombinant yeast strain was induced by 0.5% methanol.
The recombinant lipoxygenase encoded by CsLOX1 was
purified and characterized. The molecular mass of
recombinant CsLOX1 was represented by a unique band
of expected size (approximately 98 kDa) in Coomassie
brilliant blue stained SDS-PAGE whereas no such similar band was seen in induced control strains harbouring
the empty vector (Figure 2).
Biochemical activity of the purified recombinant
CsLOX1 was investigated by measuring the increase in
A234 using linoleic, linolenic, and arachidonic acids as
substrates. The optimum pH was determined by varying
the pH values of the reaction buffers from 2.0 to 8.0. At
25°C, the optimum pH turned out to be 3.6 (Figure 3A)
since CsLOX1 showed the highest activity (16.2 units/
mg protein with linoleic acid as substrate) at that pH.
The enzyme activity was also fairly high (about 70%) at
the pH range of 2.0 to 3.8 (Figure 3B). However, the
activity dropped to 7.78 units/mg protein and 2.16
units/mg protein with linolenic and arachidonic acids as
substrates, respectively.
The kinetic parameters were analysed using linoleic
and linolenic acids as substrates (Table 1). The recombinant CsLOX1 showed 4.29-fold higher Km value for linoleic acid (141.12 μM) than for linolenic acid (32.89 μM).
Comparison of the Vmax values showed that CsLOX1
oxidized linoleic acid approximately 6 times faster than
linolenic acid did. The kcat/Km values of recombinant
CsLOX1 for linoleic acid and linolenic acid hydroperoxidation were 38.55 and 26.72 s-1 μM-1, respectively. These
results indicate that linoleic acid is clearly the preferred
substrate for the recombinant CsLOX1.
In order to study the position-specificity of recombinant CsLOX1, we separated the reaction products by SPHPLC. The retention times of CsLOX1 products were

Figure 1 Phylogenetic analysis of CsLOX1 and selected plant LOXs showing clustering within two groups. Plant LOXs in group I were
localized in the chloroplast with a chloroplast transit peptides and group II LOXs were localized in the cytoplasm. The alignment of amino acid
sequences of the LOXs was performed using ClustalW. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by neighbour-joining method using MEGA
software. Accession numbers of the sequences used to build the tree were as follows: maize: ZmLOX3 (AF329371), ZmLOX10 (DQ335768), and
ZmLOX11(DQ335769); potato: StLOXH1 (T07062), StLOXH3 (T07062), PtLOXA (X95513), and StLOX-2 (Y18548); poplar: PdLOX1 (DQ131178) and
PdLOX2 (DQ131179); rice: OsRCI-1 (AJ270938), OsLOX1(DQ389164), and OsR9-LOX1(AB099850); almond: PdLOX (AJ404331); hazelnut: LOX1:Ca:1
(AJ417975); tea plant: CsLOX1 (EU195885); olive: LOX (EU678670); and barley: HvLOX3 (L37358) and HvLOXA (L35931).

consistent with authentic standards of both 9- and 13HPOD and those of soybean LOX1 (Figure 4A, B).
CsLOX1 produced both 9-HPOD and 13-HPOD in equal
proportion in the reaction mixture (Figure 4C). This
observation is inconsistent with the positional specificity
rule of plant LOXs, namely that R/TV motif at the active
site indicated the 9-LOX [1]. Although R/TV motif was
found at positions 730, 579, and 580, the CsLOX1 products contained 9-HPOD as well as 13-HPOD. In this
study, it was evident that CsLOX1 was a dual-positionspecific lipoxygenase and was accordingly named tea
plant 9/13-CsLOX1. The stereochemistry of the reaction
products was analysed by chiral-phase HPLC. 9-HPOD
and 13-HPOD were predominantly in the S configuration, indicating that they had been derived from the
activity of a specific enzyme (Figure 4C).
Expression of CsLOX1 in different tissues

To study the tissue specificity of CsLOX1, quantitative
RT-PCR was used for examining its expression pattern
in the root, stem, leaf, flower (petal, stamen, and pistil),

and seed. Transcript abundance of CsLOX1 was the
highest in flower and the lowest in the rest (Figure 5).
Petals showed the highest transcript levels, about 940fold higher than those in leaves. A similar expression
pattern in floral tissues has been reported in pea LOX
[34], peanut PnLOX1 [35], and rose RLOX1 [18]. In
rose, the transcript of the RLOX1 gene was dramatically
increased in response to senescence of petals, and the
gene was held to play a role in promoting petal senescence [18].
Total LOX activity during flower bud opening and
senescence

Since earlier reports suggest that LOXs are involved in
regulating plant growth and development [23], we analysed total LOX activity in vitro during flower bud opening and senescence in eight stages, which were
designated as follows (Figure 6): S0, buds maturing but
yet green; S1, buds slightly white, closed, and with firm
tips; S2, buds white, expanded, with soft tips but not yet
open; S3, half-opened flowers; S4, just opened flowers,

flowers 24 h after S4; S6, fully open flowers about 48 h
after S4 with petals showing initial signs of senescence;
S7, fully open flowers about 72 h after S4 with clearly
rolled-in petals and separated from the plant together
with stamens.
The total LOX activity during opening and senescence had at least two clearly different phases, the
decreasing phase and the increasing phases (Figure 7).
In the first phase, when the buds were opening, total
LOX activity declined by about 80% from S1 to S3; in
the second phase, the activity increased slowly from S3
to S5 and then more rapidly to S7 and was about 8fold higher than that in S3. During this process, the
flower opened fully and then senesced gradually; total
LOX activity began to increase even before the petals
had fully expanded. LOX activity also increased slightly
from S0 to S1, when the bud was developing. Taken
together, the LOX activity was relatively high when
floral buds were tightly closed, which may indicate that
they were in the process of development, declined to
the lowest level during flower opening, and began to
increase again, peaking at senescence. In A. peruviana
too, total LOX activity declined when the buds were

opening [20] but differed from the present case in that
it continued to decline right up to senescence when
the perianth abscised. In this study, LOX activity during flower senescence was similar to that in day lily
petals in that the activity began to increase even before
flower opening and then increased more rapidly during
petal senescence [17].

Expression analysis of CsLOX1 in flower bud opening and
senescence

To find out whether the CsLOX1 gene is involved in tea
flower opening and senescence, real-time quantitative
RT-PCR was carried out. Transcript analysis of CsLOX1

during flower bud opening showed that gene expression
decreased after S1 and remained low until S4, during
which the petals opened fully (Figure 8A).
Transcripts of the CsLOX1 gene increased dramatically
in tea petals from S5 to S6 and from S6 to S7, when the

petals reached senescence and withered (Figure 8B). In
other words, the gene was down-regulated during petal
opening and up-regulated after the petals had opened
fully, especially during petal senescence. The pattern of
expression of the CsLOX1 gene during flower bud opening and senescence was similar to that of total LOX activity observed during the same stages. The CsLOX1 gene
expression level during S1 was only 1.76% of that during
S7 but the total LOX activity during S1 was approximately 61.5% of that during S7 and therefore of comparable magnitude. As the tea plant had at least four LOX
genes (data not shown), it is likely that total LOX activity
during S1 involved other lipoxygenase isoforms as well in
flower development, whereas the CsLOX1 gene is
expressed during development as well as during senescence and plays a preeminent role in senescence.

Effect of MeJA, SA, and mechanical damage on CsLOX1
transcription

In leaves, exogenous MeJA induced the expression of
the CsLOX1 gene (Figure 9). Maximum expression of
CsLOX1 after the MeJA treatment was at 12 h and
decreased thereafter, although it remained higher
than that in the control at 48 h. Unlike MeJA, exogenous SA did not increase CsLOX1 mRNA accumulation but suppressed it slightly (Figure 9).
Transcripts of CsLOX1 accumulated rapidly to reach
a high level 3 h after mechanical damage but
decreased at 6 h and 12 h following the injury–only
to increase again at 24 h to reach an even higher
level at 48 h (Figure 10). Thus CsLOX1 appears to
be up-regulated by wounding and MeJA but not by
SA.

To explore the role of CsLOX1 in mitigating the stress
occasioned by herbivores, two different phloem feeders,
namely the tea green leafhopper and the tea aphid, were
placed on tea leaves.
In leaves eaten by leafhoppers, CsLOX1 transcripts
increased rapidly to the highest level (approximately
14-fold more than that in the control) 1.5 h after exposure to the pest but declined to about 60% of that in the
highest level at 3 h; after 3 h, the level increased again
until 24 h and declined thereafter to 70% of the highest
level at 48 h, but still remained higher than control
(Figure 10).
In the case of the tea aphid, CsLOX1 transcript pattern fell into three phases (Figure 11): in the first phase,
the expression increased and the gene was up-regulated
within the first 3 h, similar to the results of mechanical
wounding and the MeJA treatment; in the second
phase, the expression declined sharply and the gene was
down-regulated at 6 h and 12 h, suggesting that the
aphids had suppressed gene expression at that phase; in
the third phase, 24 h and 48 h after the treatment, the
gene was up-regulated again and the expression
increased to its highest level. Triggering of the transcription and a rapid increase in its expression level
were the most frequently observed responses to insect
attack [3], a pattern consistent with that observed by
earlier workers, namely that some LOXs, together with
other defence-related genes, decrease their expression
during infection [36].

Analysis of LOX-derived volatiles from intact leaves and
from those damaged by different insects

To ascertain the possible involvement of CsLOX1 in the
synthesis and emission of green-leaf volatiles in the tea
plant as a defensive response to attack by insects, the profiles of LOX-derived volatile compounds obtained from
intact plants and from those damaged by the tea green
leafhopper and the tea aphid were analysed and compared.

The LOX-derived volatiles consisted of C-6 and C-9 aldehydes, alcohols, and esters. As shown in Figure 12, intact
tea plants released nonanal, a C-9 aldehyde, but it was not
detected in plants attacked by the phloem feeders. On the
other hand, the C-6 volatiles, namely (3Z)-hexenol, (2E)hexenal, and (3Z)-hexenyl acetate, were the main components of the volatiles released by the infested plants.
In the case of the leafhoppers, the infested plants
released greater quantities of (3Z)-hexenol and (2E)hexenal and slightly lower quantities of (3Z)-hexenyl
acetate than the intact plants did. This pattern correlated
with the increase in the expression level of CsLOX1 in
plants attacked by the leafhoppers (Figures 10 and 12).
In the case of the tea aphids, the infested plants
released lower quantities of (3Z)-hexenol and (3Z)hexenyl acetate but greater quantities of (2E)-hexenal
and also released (2Z)-hexenoic acid. These results suggest that some LOX-derived volatiles were suppressed
and some others were induced as a result of aphid infestation. The emission of LOX-derived volatiles by aphidinfested plants correlated with the expression pattern of
CsLOX1 (Figures 11 and 12). In addition, the increased
levels of (2E)-hexenal following aphid infestation were
reported to be part of a tritrophic interaction wherein
the volatile attracts the predators and parasites of the
tea aphid such as Leis axyridis, Chrysopa septempunctata, and Aphidius sp., and thus plays an indirect role in
the plant’s defence mechanism [30,31].

leafhopper and the tea aphid.

Discussion
The similarities in amino acid sequences of other plant
LOXs and those of CsLOX1 were examined to identify
the gene. The predicted gene included all the typical
plant LOX domains but lacked an N-terminal transit
peptide. Phylogenetic analysis showed that CsLOX1 can
be characterized as a type 1 LOX gene, which is commonly found in the cytoplasm. The gene appears to be
closely related to the LOXs in olive, almond, potato, and
hazelnut, but shares few similarities with type 2 LOXs,
which are known to be located in chloroplasts. After the
CsLOX1 gene was introduced into yeast P. pastoris, it
was heterologously expressed and its products showed
lipoxygenase activity but showed characteristics that differed from those of other plant LOXs. Generally, plant
LOXs position-specificity is determined by the primary
motifs R/TH, R/TF, R/SF, or R/CF for 13-LOX and R/
TV for 9-LOX at the active site [1]. The CsLOX1 contained an R/TV motif and was predicted to be 9-LOX.
Surprisingly, as shown by HPLC analysis, both 9- and
13- hydroperoxides of linoleic acid, predominantly in
the S configuration, were produced in equal proportion
by the recombinant CsLOX1, a feature that did not fit
the predictive position-specificity models; similar results
were observed in some other plant LOXs such as potato
StLOX-2 [37], maize ZMLOX1 [38], hazelnut LOX1:Ca:1
[39], pea LOXN2 [40], rice OsLOX1 [11], and olive LOX
[8]. These enzymes displayed a dual-positional-specificity and may be named 9/13-LOXs. Within the 9/13LOXs group, maize ZmLOX1 responded to wounding
and MeJA, but MeJA induced ZmLOX1 expression exhibiting a biphasic pattern comprising an early phase and
a late phase [38]; rice OsLOX1 was induced by wounding and was involved in defence against BPH [11]; and
olive LOX was mainly expressed during late developmental stages, and may be associated with fruit ripening
and senescence [8]. It was reported that LOX specificity
has implications for hydroperoxide metabolism, and 9/
13-LOX products such as 9-and 13-hydroperoxide from
linoleic and linolenic acids can be converted into volatile
aldehydes by hydroperoxide lyase (HPL), whereas 13hydroperoxide from linolenic acid can be converted into
JA cyclic precursors by AOS [1,2,8]. These results suggest that 9/13-CsLOX1 is involved in diverse biological
branches of the LOX pathway and is able to produce
compounds that play important roles in a plant’s development and in its defence response [5].
The optimal pH for recombinant CsLOX1 activity was
3.6, which might be the lowest reported for any plant
LOX to date, including pea LOXN2 (4.5) [40], rice
OsLOX1 (4.8) [11], rose Rlox1 (4.8) [18], and carnation
soluble LOX isoforms (4.9-5.8) [41]. The acidic LOXs
from carnation and rose petals are believed to play an

Page 10 of 15

important role in flower senescence by way of membrane disruption by the HPOs and free radical action
[18,41]. However, in processes other than senescence,
especially during flower opening, these potentially harmful components and other reactive oxygen species (ROS)
should be prevented from acting. Total LOX activity
decreased during the flower opening stage in A. peruviana [20], and endogenous H2O2 decreased and the specific activity of protective enzymes increased or
remained at a higher level than that at senescence in
day lily [17]. Our results showed that CsLOX1, together
with the flower LOX activity, was suppressed during
flower bud opening and high levels of it were induced
during petal senescence. These results indicate that
CsLOX1 is involved in flower development, playing a
regulatory role in flower senescence.
Analysis of tissue-specific mRNA accumulation showed
that CsLOX1 levels were the lowest in leaves. CsLOX1
was induced and its transcripts accumulated above the
basal level following mechanical wounding or MeJA
treatment, but SA treatment did not induce CsLOX1.
Two LOX genes in poplars (PdLOX1 and PdLOX2) were
also up-regulated by mechanical wounding and exposure
to MeJA, but both were down-regulated by SA. The
genes were reported to be involved in defending poplars
against the necrotrophic pathogen Marssonina brumnea
f. sp. Multigermtubi [42]. Also, the rice OsHI-LOX gene
expression levels were induced by mechanical damage
and JA treatment but not by SA, and the gene was proved
to have a role in herbivore-induced JA biosynthesis [28].
CsLOX1, together with the above genes, seems to be
involved in JA-related plant defence and that against
attacks by herbivores.
On the basis of LOX-derived volatiles, it was inferred
that the LOX pathway is activated mainly following
infestation by the tea green leafhopper whereas in
aphid-infested plants, the LOX pathway is not only
induced inadequately but also positively suppressed.
Concerning expression of the LOX gene in response to
attack by the tea green leafhopper and the tea aphid, it
appeared that although the gene had different transcript
patterns, each had a clear correlation with the emission
pattern of LOX-derived volatiles. Tea green leafhopper
is a highly mobile, opportunistic phloem-feeding herbivore, and the gene’s response to sucking by the insect is
transient and biphasic: The first phase begins within
about 1.5 h after the insect begins feeding, and the highest transcript level is reached during this phase; the second phase begins 3 h after the feeding has started, and
the expression level continues to be fairly high in this
phase. In the case of mechanical wounding, the pattern
of expression is similar although the transcript level is
lower (Figure 10): CsLOX1 accumulates rapidly at 3 h

Liu and Han BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:228
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/228

and also has two phases. Pea LOXN2 exhibits similar
expression patterns in response to wounding [40] and
maize LOX1, to exogenous MeJA treatment [38]. These
LOXs function in different phases of the response to
stress and are deployed quickly in response to cell
damage due to oxidative burst [38,40], decline rapidly
thereafter, and either remain at the elevated level
throughout the defensive response or return to their
normal levels in tissue development. Oral secretions of
the tea aphid are produced over a longer time than
those of the leafhopper and the aphid also continues
feeding for much longer [43,44]. Accordingly, the aphid
elicits a multi-stage response, which comprises two upregulation stages separated by a suppression stage (Figure 11). Some aphids strongly induce LOX transcripts
and elicit JA-mediated resistance [45] but others do not
[26,46]. On the other hand, some aphids use a decoy
strategy to suppress an effective JA response by inducing
SA-dependent defence in a variety of plant species
[47,48]. These reports indicated that the role of JArelated LOXs in resistance to aphids varies from one
plant species to the next. Our results showed that MeJA
induction of CsLOX1 gene in the tea plant following
aphid attack is more complicated, as revealed by the
alternating stages of induction and suppression of the
gene. The tea aphid may use its oral secretions while
feeding on tea leaves to neutralize some effective
defence mechanism involving JA whereas with the tea
green leafhopper, the plant has to deal mostly
with wounding, and JA-related resistance may prove
adequate. These aspects, however, need further
investigation.

Conclusions
Based on similarities in the sequence of amino acids, we
have identified a LOX pathway gene, CsLOX1, the
expression level of which in petals was 940 times greater
than that in leaves. The gene showed opposing regulation patterns during flower development: the expression
was down-regulated during flower opening but strongly
up-regulated during petal senescence. In leaves, the gene
was up-regulated following wounding and MeJA treatments and was also induced in response to feeding by
the tea green leafhopper but suppressed in response to
feeding by the tea aphid at some stage of the protracted
and complicated interaction between the plant and the
aphid. When the CsLOX1 gene was over-expressed in
yeast, the purified protein showed unusual catalysis over
a broad acidic pH range of 2.0 to 3.8 and displayed dual
positional specificity with 9/13-LOX activity. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the 9/13-LOX plays diverse
roles in plant development and the plant’s defence
mechanisms. Further investigation aimed at evaluating
other LOXs or genes downstream of the LOX pathway

will help in understanding the function of tea plant oxylipins in defence and development.

Methods
Plant materials

Mature seeds of tea (Camellia sinensis ’Longjing 43’)
were harvested from the experimental field of the Tea
Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural
Science (TRI, CAAS), Hangzhou, China, and plants
from the seeds were grown in a greenhouse under controlled conditions (50%-70% relative humidity, 20-30°C,
and 12 h of light alternating with 12 h of darkness). Tea
plants with six to eight leaves were used for the experiments. For herbivore infestation, the plants were placed
in a climate chamber (70 ± 10% relative humidity, 25 ±
2°C, and the same photoperiod as mentioned above).
Flowers harvested at different developmental stages
were used for analysing LOX activity and petals from
the flowers were used for analysing gene expression.
MeJA, SA, and wounding treatments of leaves

MeJA (Sigma, 95%) and SA were diluted to their final
concentrations of 200 μM and 2.5 mM, respectively,
with sterile water containing 0.01% Tween-20. The solutions were sprayed onto tea leaves; leaves sprayed only
with 0.01% Tween-20 served as a control. For the
wounding treatment, leaves were pricked with a sterilized pin. All treated leaves were harvested at different
times after the treatment, frozen quickly in liquid N2,
and stored at -70°C until required.
Infestation with the tea green leafhopper

Ten tea plants with tender leaves were deliberately
infested with about 100 nymphs of the tea green leafhopper, and each plant was covered with a small mesh
bag to prevent the nymphs from moving to other tea
plants. Infested leaves were collected at 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 24
and 48 h after the beginning of the infestation. Healthy
tea leaves free of any infestation were harvested as a
control. The harvested leaves were frozen in liquid N2
and stored at -70°C. Volatiles were collected from plants
that had been infested by the tea green leafhopper
for 24 h.
Infestation with the tea aphid

The method was the same as that described above in
every respect except that 500 aphids were used for infestation. The aphids were removed with a soft brush
before harvesting.
Isolation of full-length CsLOX1 cDNA

Leaves that had been exposed to biotic or abiotic
sources of stress were used for full-length cDNA cloning. Three pairs of degenerate primers (P1, P2, and P3)

Liu and Han BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:228
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/228

were designed according to the conserved regions of
plant LOXs sequences. P1 primers comprised LOX-S1
(5’-ATGAAGAARAATGTKTTGGAYTT-3’) corresponding to the conserved amino acid region
“MKKNVLDF” and LOX-A1 (5’-TTRAGGTAGAAYTCACTRTGRTG-3’) corresponding to the conserved
amino acid sequence region “HHSEFYLK”. P2 primers
comprised LOX-S2 (5’-ATYTATGTNCCRAGAGA
YGA-3’) encoding “IYVPRDE” and LOX-A2 (5’-TCT
TCRTCHGTYCKCCAWGCAG-3’) encoding “TAWRTDEE”. P3 primers comprised LOX-S3 (5’-CATGGYGACAARAAAGAYGAGCC-3’) encoding “HGDKKHE” and
LOX-A3 (5’-ATTGARACACTRTTRGGWATTCC-3’; R
= A, G; K = G, T; Y = C, T; N = A, T, C, G; H = A, C,
T; W = A, T) encoding “GIPNSVSI”. PCR were performed using each pair of the primers separately and
the central regions of tea plant CsLOX1 cDNA were
amplified. Full-length cDNA of CsLOX1 was obtained
by 5’ and 3’ RACE approaches. For 3’ RACE, two genespecific forward primers (L3-1F: 5’-TGTCAAGG
CATTCGTCAG-3’ and L3-2F: 5’-CATTCGTCAGAT
GAGGTC-3’) associated with an oligo(dT) 18 primer
were used to amplify the 3’ end. The 5’ RACE-PCR was
carried out as recommended by the manufacturer of the
commercial kit (Takara, Japan). A combination of genespecific reverse primers (L5-1R:5’-GTCGGCAT
TAACTGCACTTATGAG-3’ and L5-2R:5’-GCATT
GAAGTCGTTAAAGTCCAA-3’) and the adapter oligonucleotide provided in the kit was used to amplify the
5’ end containing the 5’-UTR. To confirm that all the
segments were derived from the same cDNA transcripts,
two primers were designed to amplify the full-length
CsLOX1 cDNA. The upstream primer LOX-U:
5’-TTGCTTGTCACTTTTTTTTGGTA-3’ was designed
based on the sequence of the 5’ RACE product, while
the downstream primer, LOX-D: 5’-TCAAATTGAAACACTATTAGGAA-3’, was designed from the sequence
of the 3’ RACE product. All PCR products of interest
were purified, cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and sequenced.
Sequence analysis, alignment, and phylogenetic
relationship

The identity search of CsLOX1 full-length cDNA and its
deduced protein was carried out initially using BLAST,
a database available at the website of the National Center for Biotechnology Information http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/BLAST/. The CsLOX1 sequence was then
aligned with the sequences of other plant LOXs using
ClustalW software http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/. The
phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbourjoining method, and a bootstrap value was calculated
from 1000 replicates using MEGA 4.0 http://www.megasoftware.net/index.html.

Heterologous expression and purification of CsLOX1
in Yeast

The ORF of the CsLOX1 cDNA was amplified by PCR
using the oligonucleotide primers 5’-GCGTACG
TAATGTTGCACAGGGTTGTGGA-3’ and 5’-GTC
GCGGCCGCTCAAATTGAAACACTATTAGG-3’.
These primers introduced a SnaB I and a Not I site
(underlined) at the CsLOX1 ORF 5’ and 3’ ends, respectively. The PCR product was digested with the restriction enzymes SnaB I and Not I and ligated to P. pastoris
expression vector pPIC9K (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA), which was also digested with the same enzymes.
The recombinant plasmid harbouring the yeast a-signal
in frame with CsLOX1 coding sequences was validated
by sequence analysis and named pPIC9K/lox1. P. pastoris strain GS115 was transformed with 10 μg of Sac Ilinearized recombinant plasmid pPIC9K/lox1 using a
Gene Pulser electroporator (BioRad, Hercules, CA,
USA) and subsequently plated on minimal methanol
agar substrate. The empty pPIC9K vector was transferred into GS115 Pichia host strain as control.
The recombinant colonies were first grown in 5 ml
BMGY (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.1 M potassium
phosphate [pH 6.0], 13.4 g/l of yeast nitrogen base without
amino acids, 400 μg/l biotin, and 1% [v/v] glycerol) at 30°
C until the log phase growth (OD600 = 2~6). Cells were
harvested, washed, and suspended in BMMY (the same
composition as above except that 0.5% [v/v] methanol
replaced the glycerol) to a final concentration of 1 OD600.
CsLOX1 biosynthesis was induced by adding 0.5% (v/v)
methanol in BMMY for 5 d and then measured.
The culture filtrate was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10
min at 4°C and the resultant supernatant was used as a
crude enzyme extract preparation and later purified. Solid
ammonium sulphate was added to the culture filtrate to
70% saturation. After 12 h the resulting precipitate was collected by centrifuging at 8000 g for 15 min, dissolved in a
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and dialyzed overnight
during which the buffer was changed three times. Insoluble
material was removed by centrifuging at 10 000 g for 10
min. Ion-exchange chromatography was carried out using
DEAE-sepharose: the dialyzed sample was put on a DEAEsepharose column (1 × 20 cm) equilibrated with the same
buffer. After the column had been washed with five column
volumes of the buffer, a linear gradient of NaCl (0-0.3 M in
50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) was applied at a flow rate of 60
ml/h. Fractions with lipoxygenase activity were pooled for
the determination of purity and other properties. The
enzyme was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and assayed for LOX activity.
LOX activity

LOX activity was determined spectrophotometrically by
continuously monitoring the increase in A234 resulting from

Liu and Han BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:228
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/228

the formation of conjugated diene structures during the
oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. One unit of LOX
activity was the amount of enzyme required to produce 1
μmol of HPO and hydroxy acid per min at 25°C [49].
Protein measurement was performed as described by
Bradford [50] using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Each sample had three replicates and each measurement was repeated three times. For LOX activity in
the flowers, total protein was extracted from approximately 1 g of floral tissue in a pestle and mortar with
sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 1% (w/v)
polyvinylpolypyrrolidone at 4°C. The homogenate was
centrifuged at 12 000 g for 10 min at 4°C, and the
supernatant was collected as the crude enzyme source
and stored at -70°C for analysing LOX activity.
Characterization of the recombinant CsLOX1

The pH-activity profiles of recombinant CsLOX1 were
measured at different pH values. The following buffers
were used at 50 mM: KCl-HCl (pH 2.0), glycin-HCl (pH
2.2-3.6), CH 3 COOH-CH 3 COONa (pH 3.8, 4.0, 5.0),
Na 2 HPO 4 -NaH 2 PO 4 (pH 6.0, 7.0), and Tris-HCl (pH
8.0). The reaction mixture (3 ml) consisted of 0.3 mM
linoleic acid in 50 mM buffer with different pH values
and 0.1 ml purified enzyme solution. The control reaction was carried out using the same pH buffer but using
water instead of the enzyme. The increased A 234 was
monitored in the spectrophotometer for 5 min. The
slope of the linear portion of the plot was used to calculate the LOX activity. For the optimal temperature analysis, the LOX activities were measured in 50 mM buffer
over a temperature range of 15-50°C in increments of 5°
C. Each sample consisted of 3 replicates. The maximum
activity was estimated to be 100%. The kinetic parameters had been determined from a Michaelis-Menton
plot in a range of substrate concentrations (linoleic acid
and linolenic acid) between 75 and 600 μM.
For analysing the CsLOX1 products, the reaction mixture of enzyme activity was stopped by adding 0.1 M
HCl solution, n-hexane was then added to the mixture,
and the products were extracted by shaking. The 9HPOD and 13-HPOD isomers were analysed using a
Waters series system (Milford, MA, USA) with a silica
ultrasphere column (Inertsil® SIL-100A, 250 × 4.6 mm, 5
μm particle size). The elutant consisted of n-hexane: 2propanol: acetic acid (100:5:0.1, v/v/v) at 1 ml/min and
the effluent was monitored at 234 nm. Enantiomer composition analysis was carried out using chiral-phase
HPLC on a Chiralcel OBH column (Daicel Chem.
Industries, 250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm particle size); the solvent system comprised hexane:2-propanol:acetic acid
(100:5:0.1, v/v/v) and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Standards
of 9- and 13-HPOD were purchased from Larodan
(Malm, Sweden).

RNA extraction and quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis

Total RNAs from roots, stems, leaves, seeds, flowers
(petals, stamens and pistils), petals at different stages,
herbivore-infested leaves, mechanically wounded leaves,
and hormone-treated leaves were extracted using Trizol
following the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). cDNA was prepared using 2 μg
DNase-treated RNA, oligo(dT)18 primer, and Superscript
III Polymerase (Invitrogen) to a total volume of 20 μl.
The cDNA was diluted 1:10 with water, and 2 μl of the
diluted cDNA was used as a template for real-time PCR
experiments.
Real-time PCR reactions were perfomed in a total
volume of 50 μl, 0.4 μM of each primer and 25 μl of 2 ×
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Takara, Japan) on an ABI
7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems,
USA). The PCR program consisted of a preliminary step
of 1 min at 95°C followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and
at 60°C for 34 s. No-template controls for each primer pair
were included in each run. The primers were designed
based on the sequence of CsLOX1 ORF and 3’-UTR, the
upstream primer: 5’-GCTGACTGGACAACCGATGA -3’,
and the downstream primer: 5’-CAACATATGCTTCT
ATGAAAATGC-3’. The oligonucleotides used for control
expression analysis were designed on the basis of GAPDH,
the upstream primer: 5’-ATACCACGTCATCCTCGGT3’, and the downstream primer: 5’-ACTTATGATGAAATCAAAGCTGC -3’, and the product was about
100 bp. At least three different RNA isolations and cDNA
syntheses were used as replicates for the qPCR. The LOX/
GAPDH ratios for all samples were related to the ratio for
untreated plants, which was set to 1.
Collection and analysis of volatiles

Before collecting the volatiles from each infested plant,
the insects were carefully removed. The intact and
insect challenged plants were separately placed in a 25 l
glass vessel with an inlet and an outlet. Dried and purified air was guided through the inlet at 250 ml/min for
48 h. A Tenax TA column with 150 mg absorbent
(Supelco, Inc., Bellefonte, PA, USA) activated under 275°
C with nitrogen for 4 h was attached to the outlet. Volatiles were desorbed by eluting the Tenax traps with 1 ml
freshly distilled hexane. Then 20 μl of a 100 μg/ml
decanoic acid ethyl ester were added as an internal standard. The resulting extract was concentrated to about
20 μl under a stream of nitrogen, 2 μl of which were
directly analyzed by GC-MS on a Trace 2000 gas chromatograph fitted with an apolar column DB-5MS (30 m
× 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 um, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA) coupled with a Trace
DSQ mass selective detector (MS). The oven temperature was programmed as follows: 50°C for 5 min, raised
to 180°C at 2°C/min, and finally raised to 230°C at 10°

C/min and held for 10 min. The injection was splitless
and the injector temperature was 230°C. The mass spectra were obtained under electron ionization impact at
70 eV and data acquisition was done under a full scan
MS mode. Identifications were confirmed with retention
time and peak enhancement on co-injection with
authentic commercial samples. Quantifications of volatiles were confirmed by comparison of their peak area
with that of the internal standard.
