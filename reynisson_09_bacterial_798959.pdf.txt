Abstract
Background: The bacteriology during storage of the North-Atlantic cod has been investigated for
the past decades using conventional cultivation strategies which have generated large amount of
information. This paper presents a study where both conventional cultivation and cultivation
independent approaches were used to investigate the bacterial succession during storage of cod
loins at chilled and superchilled temperatures.
Results: Unbrined (0.4% NaCl) and brined (2.5% NaCl) cod loins were stored at chilled (0°C) and
superchilled (-2 and -3.6°C) temperatures in air or modified atmosphere (MA, % CO2/O2/N2: 49.0
± 0.6/7.4 ± 0.2/43.7 ± 0.4). Discrepancy was observed between cultivation enumeration and culture
independent methods where the former showed a general dominance of Pseudomonas spp. (up to
59%) while the latter showed a dominance of Photobacterium phosphoreum (up to 100%).
Gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (GC-MC) showed that trimethylamine was the
most abundant volatile in mid- and late storage periods. Terminal restriction polymorphism (tRFLP) analysis showed that the relative abundance of P. phosphoreum increased with storage time.
Conclusion: The present study shows the bacteriological developments on lightly salted or nonsalted cod loins during storage at superchilled temperatures. It furthermore confirms the
importance of P. phosphoreum as a spoilage organism during storage of cod loins at low
temperatures using molecular techniques. The methods used compensate each other, giving more
detailed data on bacterial population developments during spoilage.

Background
The Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is a cold-adapted fish
species which has been captured for human consumption
for many years. It is a perishable commodity and for that
reason, preservation methods like freezing or salting have
traditionally been used to extend its shelf life [1,2].
The fish is a microbial ecosystem of its own where the ecological principles of succession are as valid as in any other
ecosystem. This microbiological environment consists of
a high nutrient content with an oxygen tension favourable
to the proliferation of fast-growing heterotrophs also
responsible for the spoilage of food [3-5]. Until now, the
process of fish spoilage has been investigated intensively
with regard to sensory evaluation, chemical changes of
volatile and non-volatile compounds and microbiological
growth by cultivation methods [5-9].
Pseudomonas spp. and Shewanella putrefaciens were early
recognised as putative spoilage inducers in fish muscle
and have since then been found in various fish species
from fresh- and marine waters as well as in other foods
[10,11]. These species are generally associated with spoilage of fish stored under aerobic conditions while Photobacterium phosphoreum has been reported as the main
spoilage organism in modified atmosphere (MA) packed
fish, being CO2-tolerant and producing trimethylamine
(TMA) from trimethylamine oxide [5,12,13]. P. phosphoreum is not as easily cultivated as many other heterotrophs found in fish, as it is vulnerable to temperature
fluctuations [14]. The importance of this species during
the spoilage of fish was therefore identified later both in
MAP [12,14,15] and air-stored fish products [1,16,17].
However, storage under superchilled conditions delayed
P. phosphoreum development in cod fillets while H2S-producing bacteria, most likely Sh. putrefaciens, were not
affected and reached high levels [1]. The spoilage organisms involved in any given fish can vary among fish species and its habitat. Other bacterial species have also been
associated with fish spoilage, e.g. Brochothrix thermosphacta, Aeromonas spp., Vibrio spp. and Enterobacteriaceae
[8].
Until recently, most studies dealing with food microbiology of fish have used conventional cultivation methods
for estimation of bacterial growth. In recent years, the use
of molecular methodology has increased enormously
where microbiological diversity has been documented
with cultivation independent methods [18-20]. The abundance of selected species has furthermore been monitored
with the use of specific detection methods such as realtime PCR [21].
The work presented here was performed in parallel to a
larger shelf life trial assessing the effects of brining, MA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/250

packaging and superchilling on the shelf life and quality
parameters of cod loins using conventional sensory,
chemical and microbiological methods [15]. The aim of
the present study was to examine the bacterial succession
that occurs during storage of cod loins differently treated
and stored under various conditions specifically using cultivation independent approach and compare it against
conventional cultivation methods.

Results
Temperature and gas measurements
During the storage trials, the average ambient temperature
in the three coolers was 0.0 ± 0.3°C; -2.0 ± 0.4°C and -3.6
± 0.8°C. These groups were therefore called 0, -2 and -4°C
groups. Average loin temperature in the polystyrene boxes
was 0.0 ± 0.4°C (0°C air-group), -1.5 ± 1.1°C (-2°C airgroup) and -2.8 ± 1.5°C (-4°C air-group). In these boxes,
fish temperature of the 0°C group reached target temperature on the packaging day, the -2°C group on day 5 and
the -4°C group on day 7. The average gas composition in
MA packages at the beginning of the experiment was CO2/
O2/N2: 49.0 ± 0.6/7.4 ± 0.2/43.7 ± 0.4. After 1 week storage a decrease of CO2 (23-28%) was detected in all packages but after that the gas composition remained
essentially the same.
Bacterial counts by cultivation during storage
Quality of the processed raw material (LS, low salt with
0.4% NaCl) was evaluated upon packaging and the total
psychrotrophic load (TVC) was found to contain less than
104 colony forming units (CFU)/g. Initial Pseudomonas
spp. load was tenfold lower (Fig. 1) and H2S-producing
bacteria almost 100-fold lower than TVC (data not
shown). P. phosphoreum was not detected (< 20 CFU/g) in
newly packaged cod loins. Generally, air storage at -2°C
did not inhibit bacterial growth compared to storage at
0°C whereas storage at -4°C clearly showed a reduced
growth throughout the storage time (Fig. 1 and 2). In MAP
fish, storage temperature clearly influenced bacterial
growth, with an increased delay as temperature decreased.
Monitoring of P. phosphoreum showed a reduction in
growth with lower temperatures, especially when combined with MA (Fig. 1).

Pseudomonas spp. showed an increasing growth during
storage in air, both at 0 and -2°C, but with some delay at
-4°C. MAP had a biostatic effect on pseudomonads development, resulting in constant counts (between 3 and 4
log10 CFU/g) at all temperatures. Similar trends could be
seen during storage of brined (HS, high salt with 2.5%
NaCl) fish where combining MA and lower temperature
storage generally inhibited bacterial growth (Fig. 2). Relative ratio of selected spoilage organisms showed a large
variation of dominance. Pseudomonas spp. were usually in
high proportional concentrations during air storage (up

to 58.9%) and at lower concentrations during MA storage.
However, on day 7 at -4°C in MA storage, Pseudomonas
spp. reached a level of 33% of the flora in both the LS and
HS groups. P. phosphoreum was at low relative concentrations (0 - 6%) except during MA storage at 0°C where it
reached up to nearly 100% (Table 1).
Bacterial community development during storage by 16S
rRNA clone analysis
Partial sequence analysis of 821 16S rRNA clones from 19
samples in the shelf life experiment was performed (Table
2). PCR and cloning of two samples failed (6 days storage
in air at -4°C, for both LS and HS treatments). The identity

of the closest relatives in the NCBI database had in most
cases a similarity of 95-100%. In the study, 25 different
bacterial species were found, with 11 of them identified to
the species level, 12 to the genus level and two unclassified genera. The estimated coverage of bacteria within a
sample ranged from 0.88 to 1.00 (Table 2).
In general, the analysis revealed a high dominance of
Photobacterium in all samples except in newly packaged
cod loins (LS) where it was not detected. At packaging, the
microflora of cod loins was dominated by Sphingomonas
spp. and Ps. fluorescens while Variovorax spp. and
Bradyrhizobium spp. were present at lower levels (Table 2).
A trend towards the succession of P. phosphoreum with
time during storage was seen in all storage conditions.
Slower succession of P. phosphoreum was observed in samples stored in air than in MA. After six days of aerobic storage, the dominance of P. phosphoreum was between 60 and
71% and other bacterial species were present in lower
numbers, e.g. Pseudomonas spp., Shewanella spp., Acinetobacter spp., Psychrobacter spp., Vibrio logei, Moritella spp.,
and Pseudoalteromonas spp. After further storage (13-15
days), near the end of shelf life, P. phosphoreum increased
its relative dominance up to 83-95% of the population
(Table 2).

The bacterial flora of fish stored under MA was dominated
by P. phosphoreum, reaching levels of 91-100% of the population at all sampling times with one exception (day 7,
MAP, -4°C, HS cod loins) where the dominance was 53%
with other species in high relative quantity, including
Chryseobacterium and Flavobacterium spp. (20 and 10%,
respectively). When the same group had been stored for
28 days the bacterial flora was composed of 91% P. phosphoreum (Table 2).
Most of the bacteria detected belong to the Gammaproteobacteria division, including the SSOs, while Bacteriodetes, Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria had
also representatives in the bacterial flora. Phylogenetic
relationship between the species detected in the 16S rRNA
analysis from all samples was depicted along with the
division classification (Fig. 3).
Bacterial diversity during storage by t-RFLP
The number of operating taxonomic units (OTU) was different between combinations of labelled primers and
restriction enzymes. Analysis of forward Tfs coupled with
HaeIII digestion resulted in 12 OTUs compared to 13
OTUs with AluI in all samples analysed. The reverse Tfs
coupled with HaeIII or AluI digestion resulted in 12 and
17 OTUs, respectively. Principal component analysis

(PCA) of Tf profiles showed a clear difference of the bacterial flora of newly packaged cod loins (LS, day 0) compared to other samples (data not shown). Excluding the
d0-samples from the analysis, a better resolution between
other samples in the study was established (Fig. 4). It
showed that all samples stored under MA clustered tightly
together regardless of storage time, temperature or salt
content. The samples stored under air showed a trend
towards the MAP cluster with the exception of the 3 HS
samples being situated at an opposite position in the score
plot. Therefore, the first principal component (PC1) distinguishes the air-stored HS samples from other samples
while PC2 seems to separate the air-stored LS samples
from early storage time (D6 Air -2° LS) to late storage

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/250

(D15 Air -2° LS), where the latter clusters with other airstored and MAP samples (Fig. 4).
In this analysis PC1 explained 44% of the variability and
PC2 26%. Except for the d0-samples, P. phosphoreum dominated the bacterial flora in all samples, with 40.7% up to
100% abundance (Table 1) when analysing the t-RFLP
profile of labelled forward primer and AluI digestion.
Using this primer/restriction enzyme combination and
analysing the sequence data of the clone library it was evident that a peak of 336 base pairs derived only from P.
phosphoreum and Vibrio logei. Other combinations had
more species with common terminal restriction site as P.
phosphoreum.

Gas Chromatography-Mass spectrometry
Chromatographic profile of volatile compounds produced during the storage was obtained for LS fish stored
at -2°C (Table 3). On the second day of storage, only a few
compounds were detected (3-methyl+1-butanol, nonanal
and decanal) and TMA was absent but their quantities
increased during the storage period. TMA was produced in
largest amounts at later stages while substances such as 3hydroxy-2-butanone (acetoin) were in relatively high
quantities in both air and MAP samples. Ethyl acetate was
also produced in high quantities but only in the air storage. Other volatile compounds were detected in lower
amounts and are summarised in Table 3 according to their
retention indices.

Discussion
Molecular analyses on bacterial communities in food
have only been applied for few years [22,23]. This paper
describes the bacterial population developments during
storage of cod loins at chilled and superchilled temperatures using both cultivation and cultivation independent
approaches.
The molecular methods showed that the flora was
directed towards the dominance of P. phosphoreum. More
diversity was generally seen in early storage in air while
during late storage, all samples showed a similar bacterial
composition dominated by P. phosphoreum. The PCA analysis of t-RFLP patterns indicated that the higher salt content of air-stored products contributed to a different
dominating bacterial flora as compared to other treatments since those samples were plotted outside the core
pattern in the PCA analysis (Fig. 4). P. phosphoreum was
found to be below the detection level at the beginning of

the storage trial, but as soon as the fish had been stored for
6-7 days, it showed an abundance of 53-100% among the
population by 16S rRNA cloning analysis. Cultivation
generally showed higher proportional levels of Pseudomonas spp. than P. phosphoreum in all storage conditions
with few exceptions. It has been shown with cultivation
that MA packaging enabled P. phosphoreum growth in fish
products [12] while other bacterial species can dominate
as well during air storage [1,16]. The present study confirms its abundance in MA conditions and its ability to
dominate under aerobic environmental condition. P.
phosphoreum has been shown to be able to reach high
numbers in aerobically stored fish such as cod, squid and
haddock [1,16,17]. In previous shelf life studies on cod
and haddock from Iceland, P. phosphoreum counts have
most often been higher than Pseudomonas spp. counts
[1,16] but that was not the case in this study.
Discrepancy between PCR strategies and cultivation is a
known phenomenon where both approaches are subjective to some degree of bias [24]. Cultivation can be biased
to some extent because of different optimal growth conditions and competition between bacterial species in the
culture medium, and importantly due to the presence of
viable but non-cultivable cells [25]. The Malthus conductance method is based on other principles than colony
counts on agar media and the harsh condition (100%
CO2) of the P. phosphoreum method might underestimate
their quantity in superchilled, MAP products. As shown in
this study, superchilled condition delays the growth rate
of P. phosphoreum and this effect is enhanced under MA
(~50% CO2). It is therefore likely that some P. phosphoreum cells from these superchilled products may be
partly damaged or in such a physiological state that it pro-

longs the lag phase and/or slows down the growth rate,
hence prolonging detection time and giving lower counts
during the Malthus incubation. With the molecular
approaches, the bias can be derived from the 16S rRNA
copy numbers per bacterial genome. Data on 16S rRNA
copy number in the P. phosphoreum genome is not available but its close relative, P. profundum contains 15 copies
while Ps. fluorescens and Sh. putrefaciens contain 5 and 8
copies, respectively (insilico.ehu.es, accessed in april
2008). Other factors such as different DNA extraction efficiency on different species or incongruity in the "universal" priming sites can also influence the outcome [26,27].
The microbiological activity in a fish muscle ultimately
leads to its spoilage where different bacterial species contribute to the process in different ways. Pseudomonas spp.
produce NH3, esters and sulphur compounds, Sh. putrefaciens produces TMA, H2S, hypoxantine and other sulphur
compounds and P. phosphoreum is able to produce hypoxantine, alcohols, TMA and ketones in particular acetoin
[8,9,28]. These organisms are often found in small quantities in newly processed fish but typically reach high
numbers during storage. Comparing the composition of
microbial species and of volatile compounds it is evident
that TMA is the most abundant volatile in mid- and late
storage (Table 3) which supports the dominance of P.
phosphoreum. Acetoin was also detected which can be
linked to the presence of P. phosphoreum [29]. Pseudomonas
spp. and Sh. putrefaciens have been found responsible for
the formation of volatiles sulfides, alcohols (3-methyl-1butanol, 1-penten-3-ol) and ketones (2-butanone) [30]
but these volatiles were in low quantities compared to
TMA and acetoin in cod loins which is in agreement with
earlier studies on cod fillets [9].
The composition of the natural bacterial flora of a newly
caught fish is dependent on its origin and season [31].
Therefore it could be expected that P. phosphoreum is more
likely to dominate the microflora of fish in Northern seas
than from warmer areas. Nevertheless, detection and
importance of P. phosphoreum in some Mediterranean MApacked fish products have been reported [12]. The natural
flora in the epidermis mucosa of newly caught NorthAtlantic cod has been characterised using 16S clone analysis, revealing Photobacterium, Psychrobacter, Pseudomonas,
Acinetobacter, Pseudoalteromonas, and Flavobacterium
among the commonly found species on cod epidermis
[31]. It was reported that Psychrobacter spp. was the most
abundant species of a 16S rRNA clone library followed by
Photobacterium spp. in cod caught in the Baltic, Icelandic
and North Seas. The bacterial flora of farmed cod from
Norway was recently assessed using PCR denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and it was shown that
Photobacterium spp., Sh. putrefaciens and Pseudomonas spp.
dominated in MA and air while Pseudomonas spp. were
solely in dominance in oxygen enriched atmosphere dur-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/250

ing storage [23]. However, in salt-cured cod the dominating bacteria was found to be Psychrobacter spp.,
representing more than 90% of the bacterial flora [32].
Other bacterial species detected in the study have been
isolated and identified from various sources. Janthinobacterium lividum is an aerobic bacterium commonly isolated
from the microbiota of soils and water of rivers, lakes and
springs [33]. The importance of Flavobacterium in fish
spoilage has not been reported and they are usually overgrown by Pseudomonas spp. as shown in fish spoilage
model systems [34]. Flavobacterium subspecies have been
found in other fish species such as catfish and some are
also the causative agent of bacterial cold water disease and
rainbow trout fry syndrome [35,36]. Sphingomonas spp.
have been identified in marine waters and in meat
processing plants at high levels with molecular based
identification [37,38]. Sphingomonas and Variovorax have
also been isolated from deep sea sediments [39]. Moritella
spp. have been found in marine fish, e.g. Moritella viscosa
which is a fish pathogen [40].

Conclusion
The present work describes an investigation of the succession of the dominating bacterial species during storage of
unbrined and brined cod loins at chilled and superchilled
temperatures under aerobic and MA conditions. Cultivation on selective media indicates a slight dominance of
Pseudomonas spp. in air-stored samples at low temperatures while molecular based methods, both 16S rRNA
cloning analysis and t-RFLP, indicate a high dominance of
P. phosphoreum in both air and MA packaging. Analysis of
volatiles produced during storage at -2°C supported the
dominance of P. phosphoreum showing intense TMA production. The species diversity was higher after short storage of less than one week, especially in air packaging, but
with time, P. phosphoreum reached a high dominance,
depending on the storage conditions. Discrepancy was
observed between the conventional cultivation and
molecular methods and requests a further investigation to
elucidate this matter. Nevertheless, combined strategy of
cultivation and cultivation independent methods might
be the key for deeper understanding of bacterial population developments during the spoilage process of food.

Methods
Raw material
The fish used for the shelf life experiments was captured
by trawl in October 2006 in the North of Iceland, gutted
onboard, washed with excessive seawater and stored iced
in tubs until filleted, providing a temperature around
0°C. The sea temperature was 8.5-9°C on the day of capture. The raw material was 2-3 or 4-5 days old when it was
filleted, deskinned, cut into loins and packaged for the
shelf life experiment.

Storage conditions
Earlier to packaging, a part of the fish was filleted and
stored in 4% brine for two days at around 1°C while the
other part was processed and cooled down in a 4% brine
for 8 min prior to trimming and packaging. These treatments resulted in two groups with a final salt (NaCl) concentration of 2.5 ± 1.0% (HS) and 0.4 ± 0.2% (LS). The
fish was stored in air (open bags in styrofoam boxes) and
in modified atmosphere packaging (50% CO2, 5% O2,
45% N2) at 0°C (only LS group), -2°C and -4°C resulting
in 10 treatments (Table 4). Temperatures were monitored
with loggers placed in packages at the bottom recording
the temperature every 90 s. The gas composition was
monitored using a CheckMate 9900 instrument (PBI
Dansensor, Ringsted, Denmark). Sampling was performed in duplicate periodically during the storage time.
Aerobic samples were stored for 12 (0°C) and 15 days (2°C), MA-packed samples at 0°C for 21 days but 28 days
for superchilled products.
Cultivation
Viable microbial developments were done essentially as
described before [16]. Presumptive Pseudomonas were cultivated on modified Cephaloridine Fucidin Cetrimide
(CFC) agar [41], H2S-producing bacteria on iron agar
(IA), Photobacterium phosphoreum with Malthus conductance method [42] and total viable psychrotrophic counts
on Long and Hammer's medium (LH) [43]. An estimate
of relative abundance of specific bacterial groups in samples was calculated by dividing their count on specific
medium by that of total viable count (LH) of each respective sample. This was done to compare the relative abundance of cultivated bacteria to those obtained via 16S
rRNA analysis.
DNA extraction
During the shelf life trials, fractions of tenfold diluted fish
samples were collected and kept at -80°C until DNA
extraction. Raw material and 20 storage trial samples were
selected for 16S rRNA analysis. Template genomic DNA
was isolated from one ml of these diluted samples as

described before [44]. The sample was centrifuged at
11000 × g for 7 min to form a pellet. The supernatant was
discarded and DNA was recovered from the pellet using
Promega Magnesil KF, Genomic system (MD1460) DNA
isolation kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, USA) in
combination with KingFisher magnetic beads automatic
DNA isolation instrument (Thermo Labsystems,
Waltham, USA).
16S rRNA analysis
The raw material and two samples from each treatment
were selected for DNA analysis, from early storage (days 67) and late storage (13-15 in air samples and 21-28 in MA
samples) resulting in a total of 21 samples. The PCR reaction was done by amplifying the 16S rRNA gene with universal primers, 9F and 1544R (5'-GAGTTTG ATC
CTGGCTCAG-3 and '5-CCCGGGATCCAAGCTTAGAAAG
GA-3' respectively). PCR reaction conditions, cloning and
sequencing of the PCR products obtained from the cod
samples was performed essentially as described before
[45]. Sequencing was performed directly after the PCR
reaction. Partial sequencing was performed with R805
primer; '5-GACTACCCGGGTATCTAATCC-3' resulting in
500-600 bp read length. The species coverage by the 16S
analysis was estimated using the equation

C = 1 − (n1 / Nt)
where C is coverage, n1 is the number of unpaired
sequences (number of sequences that did not group with
any other in the annealing) and Nt is the number of total
clones analyzed. Multiple alignments were carried out
using ClustalW (v.1.83) and subsequent phylogenetic
dendrogram of the 16S rRNA was plotted with the neighbour-joining software using NjPlot.
Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (tRFLP)
Extracted DNA from duplicate samples was pooled prior
to PCR for the t-RFLP analysis. The PCR was performed

with 9F forward primer (sequence above) with a 5' FAM
terminal label and HEX labelled reverse primer 805R. The
labelled PCR products were digested with HaeIII and AluI
(Fermentas, Hanover, MD, USA) in a 10 μL reaction volume for 2 h. The digested PCR product was diluted 1:20
and 2 μL added to 8 μL of GeneScan 500 LIZ internal size
standard (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) in formamide. The fragment analysis was carried out in ABI3730
DNA analyzer. A peak in the chromatogram, here after
called terminal restriction fragment (t-RF), is regarded as
one taxonomic unit. Data analysis was carried out on the
GeneMapper software (v.4.0) using the AFLP analysis
method. Peaks below a fluorescence threshold level of 50
were excluded except where a clear trend of same t-RF was
detected in other samples. Estimation of relative quantity
of P. phosphoreum was done by calculating the ratio of its
peak area to the total peak area generated in the chromatogram.

Statistical analysis of t-RFLP profiles
The relative abundance of each t-RF in the profile was calculated by dividing the respective peak area of each t-RF
with the total peak area generated between 50-600 base
pairs. The profiles from different combinations of labelled
primers and restriction enzymes were all combined in one
dataset for principal component analysis (PCA) to
enhance the analytical power of the model. PCA of t-RFLP
profiles from different fish samples was performed using
the Unscrambler version 9.5 (Camo ASA, Oslo, Norway).
The data was not weighed in order to maintain the ability
of t-RFLP to quantitatively discriminate between peaks,
representing different taxonomic units. Full cross validation was used.
