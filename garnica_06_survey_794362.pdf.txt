Abstract
Background: Members of the genus Phytophthora are notorious pathogens with world-wide
distribution. The most devastating species include P. infestans, P. ramorum and P. sojae. In order to
develop molecular methods for routinely characterizing their populations and to gain a better
insight into the organization and evolution of their genomes, we used an in silico approach to survey
and compare simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in transcript sequences from these three species. We
compared the occurrence, relative abundance, relative density and cross-species transferability of
the SSRs in these oomycetes.
Results: The number of SSRs in oomycetes transcribed sequences is low and long SSRs are rare.
The in silico transferability of SSRs among the Phytophthora species was analyzed for all sets
generated, and primers were selected on the basis of similarity as possible candidates for
transferability to other Phytophthora species. Sequences encoding putative pathogenicity factors
from all three Phytophthora species were also surveyed for presence of SSRs. However, no
correlation between gene function and SSR abundance was observed. The SSR survey results, and
the primer pairs designed for all SSRs from the three species, were deposited in a public database.
Conclusion: In all cases the most common SSRs were trinucleotide repeat units with low repeat
numbers. A proportion (7.5%) of primers could be transferred with 90% similarity between at least
two species of Phytophthora. This information represents a valuable source of molecular markers
for use in population genetics, genetic mapping and strain fingerprinting studies of oomycetes, and
illustrates how genomic databases can be exploited to generate data-mining filters for SSRs before
experimental validation.

Background
Phytophthora spp. are notorious, world-wide pathogens
because of their devastating effects on many crop species,
that often result in significant economic losses. All members of the genus Phytophthora infect plants, although
some exhibit a broad host range and others infect only a
few species [1]. Among the most important species are P.
infestans, P. sojae and the newly described species, P. ramorum [2]. P. infestans affects several host plants from the
Solanaceae family including potato, tomato and a
number of tropical fruits economically important for producer countries [3,4]. Current losses in potato production
worldwide reach $5 billion [5]. The soybean pathogen, P.
sojae, causes root rot and damping off, and in the US alone
has recently accounted for annual losses in the order of
$1–2 million [1]. P. ramorum has only been described relatively recently, so that basic information about its biology and ecology is scant. This pathogen causes sudden oak
death disease and is currently decimating trees and shrubs
in the coastal oak forest in California, including keystone
tanoak and coast live oak species, and might be expanding
to other hosts such as redwoods and to other regions in
North America [6].
Given the economic relevance of these pathogens, it is
important to standardize high-throughput molecular
methods for routinely characterizing Phytophthora populations. Genomic and bioinformatics resources have grown
exponentially in recent years, generating information
more rapidly than current data-processing tools can handle. Thus, the generation of new tools and the application
of existing ones for exploring databases constitute a practical and inexpensive approach to elucidating biological
systems. The application of bioinformatic tools to
genomic databases that are already available for different
species of Phytophthora could allow techniques for characterizing these pathogens to be developed rapidly.
Two of the most informative databases available for Phytophthora are the EST (Expressed Sequence Tags) public
databases and the Department of Energy's Joint Genome
Institute (JGI) databases in which complete genomes, predicted proteins and predicted transcripts are available for
P. sojae and P. ramorum [7]. Transcript sequences constitute a rich and special source of informative molecular
markers because they represent genes that are expressed in
an organism. Coding sequences are generally more
informative than anonymous markers because they allow
for a more direct association between the molecular
marker and the phenotype. Microsatellites or simple
sequence repeats (SSRs) are molecular markers that consist of tandem repeats of one to six DNA base pairs. SSRs
are highly versatile, PCR-based markers, usually associated with a high frequency of length polymorphism [8].
They are choice markers given that they show fairly high

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/245

mutation rates and are codominant [9,10]. They have
been found in both coding and non-coding DNA
sequences of all higher organisms analyzed [11,12]. In
oomycetes, SSRs have had important applications such as
diagnosis and determination of mating type [13], genetic
structure and disease dynamics [14,15], and population
genetics [16,17]. Apart from their application as molecular markers, determining the abundance and density of
SSRs in oomycetes may help understand whether these
sequences have any functional and evolutionary significance [18].
An innovative marker system that has been developed
links expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and SSRs [19,20].
These EST-SSRs have been applied successfully in studies
of genetic variation, linkage mapping, gene tagging, evolution and sequencing of several plant genomes [21].
Although they are less polymorphic than genomic SSRs,
EST-SSRs tend to be more conserved, at least in the plant
species in which they have been studied [22]. This characteristic makes EST-SSRs readily transferable between
related organisms [17,23-26]. Therefore, SSRs from transcript sequences have considerable potential for comparative mapping studies, as well as for analyses of genetic
diversity within the expressed portions of the genome in
which they are located.
Although Phytophthora EST and transcript databases are
publicly available, no formal analysis of SSRs in these
sequences has been reported. We used an in silico
approach to analyze the frequency and distribution of
SSRs in transcript sequences from the oomycetes Phytophthora infestans, P. sojae and P. ramorum. Previous studies on
oomycete phylogeny have suggested that these three species are monophyletic and that P. sojae and P. ramorum are
more closely related to each other than to P. infestans [2729]. We also surveyed the distribution and possible patterns of SSRs in selected sequences corresponding to genes
previously associated with pathogenesis and virulence. In
addition, we studied in silico the transferability of these
SSR-based markers between species. We generated primer
pairs, where possible, for all SSRs from these three organisms. A publicly available database was generated for Phytophthora microsatellites, including primers and SSR
survey results [30]. This study will serve as reference for
future comparative mapping studies and for the development of strategies that take advantage of DNA sequence
analyses for cross-referencing genes between species and
perhaps genera.

Results
Microsatellites: motif, length and frequency
Consensus EST databases from P. infestans and annotated
transcripts from P. sojae and P. ramorum, were scanned for
the presence of microsatellites, defined as short tandem

repeat motifs of 1–6 bp. We also explored the existence of
7–10 bp motifs, which represent the transition between
micro and minisatellites; little is known about these. A
total of 84000 available EST sequences were downloaded
from the Phytophthora Functional Genomics Database
[31] for P. infestans, and 19276 and 16066 predicted and
annotated transcripts were downloaded from the Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute [32]. The EST set
was masked for repetitive sequences, obtained from RepBase ([33]; which does not include SSR repeats), assembled and revised manually to generate consensus
sequences. We used consensus EST sequences because
they have the built-in advantage of eliminating redundant
SSR counts, allowing us to make more precise estimates of
SSR frequency. The assembly process resulted in 25965
sequences for P. infestans. Annotated transcripts were not
subjected to further treatment, and along with the consensus ESTs were used for the SSR survey.
The frequency of repeat motifs in the consensus EST
sequences and annotated transcripts was assessed. A first
analysis was performed with only the consensus ESTs
from P. infestans; more than 50% of the SSRs identified
were (A)n , which is an over-representation with respect to
the other mononucleotide repeats as well as to other
motifs. Although mononucleotide repeats are common in
genomic DNA and can be valid SSRs, most of those
present in expressed sequences are the result of nucleotide
additions by RNA polymerase and are not present in the
genomic DNA template (e.g. poly-A tails; [34]). Therefore,
the analysis of monomers was excluded and only motifs
with repeats of 2 to 6 bp (for ESTs and transcripts) were
included in this study. Both perfect and compound SSRs
were selected with a minimum acceptable length of 12 bp
for di, tri and tetra-nucleotide motifs. Only SSRs with a
minimum of three repeats were included in the analyses
of penta- and hexa-nucleotide repeats. The total counts,
frequencies and comparisons of SSRs (2–6 bp) in each set
of sequences are summarized in Tables 1, 2, 3.
P. infestans had the most sequences analyzed but showed
the lowest total SSR count and percentage of SSR-containing sequences (Table 1). However, this result has to be
considered wih caution since the total size (Mb) of the
sequences examined for P. infestans is approximaely half
that of the other organisms. To compare the organisms
more realistically, another approach was required:
namely, taking the total length of each set of sequences
analyzed as a reference. Thus, total relative abundance
and total relative density were calculated (Table 1). Statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) were found
between P. infestans and P. sojae and between P. sojae
and P. ramorum when we compared the total sequence
lengths (bp) contributed by SSRs with respect to the total
megabases of examined sequences (relative density), but

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/245

there was no difference between P. infestans and P. ramorum. The same differences were found when perfect and
compound SSR proportions were compared (data not
shown), demonstrating that SSR content is not in agreement with the phylogenetic distances between these
organisms [6]. The numbers of SSR-containing sequences
and sequences containing more than one SSR were compared only between P. sojae and P. ramorum because of
the different types of source sequences (ESTs for P.
infestans and transcripts for P. sojae and P. ramorum). All
comparisons showed statistically significant differences
(data not shown). These results might imply that the net
SSR content in transcript regions of Phytophthora species
could be variable, and again, not directly related to phylogenetic distance.
The total numbers of all types of microsatellite motifs are
shown in Table 2 and Figures 1 and 2. All three sequence
sets contained SSRs that were mainly trinucleotide repeats
(> 60%), while the dinucleotide repeats represented less
than 8%. This agrees with results from other eukaryotes,
where trinucleotide repeats are overrepresented in coding
sequences in comparison with dinucleotide repeats
[35,36]. Hexanucleotide repeats constituted the second
most frequent motif in P. sojae and P. ramorum, differing
markedly from P. infestans, where this motif has one of the
lowest percentages. In general, statistically significant differences were not found between P. sojae and P. ramorum
(proportions test, P > 0.05), showing that in contrast to
the net SSR content, SSR distributions could be related to
phylogenetic distances among Phytophthora species. Relative abundance and relative density allowed the similarities and differences among SSR distributions to be
represented graphically (Figures 1 and 2). The high relative abundance and density values observed for tri- and
hexa-nucleotides might correlate with coding region stability ([37]; see discussion).
The fifteen most frequent motifs were analyzed for all
three organisms in terms of percentage and total counts
(Table 3). Most of the motif types were present, and the
five most frequent motifs were the same, in all three Phytophthora species; however, more motifs were shared
between P. sojae and P. ramorum (~80%) than between
these two species and P. infestans (~46%). The most common trinucleotide repeats in all cases were (AGC/CGT),
(ACG/CTG) and (AAG/CTT); the most common dinucleotide repeat for P. sojae and P. ramorum was (CG/GC), in
complete contrast to P. infestans, where this motif was
least frequent. Tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotide repeat
motifs showed no clear trend among the three organisms.
In general, these results and those from the SSR distributions, reflect the more close relation between P. sojae and
P. ramorum at the sequence level.

Analysis was based on the MISA script, which identified di- to hexa-nucleotide repeat motifs (perfect and compound microsatellites) that are at
least 12 bases in length.
a Perfect

microsatellites consist of a single repeat motif and are not interrupted anywhere by a base that does not fit the repeat structure
microsatellites consist of two or more adjacent microsatellites with different repeat types

b Compound

Since the most common motifs in the three organisms
analyzed were trinucleotide repeats, we attempted to
identify the amino acid(s) encoded by these. Twenty
sequences from each organism, containing the most common triplet in each case, were randomly selected and used
for ORF analyses. The most probable open reading frame
and consequently the location of the SSR in this reading
frame were determined. The triplets analyzed (in their
canonical forms and possible variations) were (AGC)n for
P. sojae and P. ramorum and (AAG)n for P. infestans respectively. In P. sojae and P. ramorum, CAG (glutamine) was
predominant at 80% and 60% respectively, followed by
AGC (serine) at 10% and 35%, and finally GCA (alanine)

at 10% and 5%. In P. infestans, GAG (glutamic acid) was
predominant at 50%, followed by AAG (lysine) at 30%
and finally CTT (leucine) at 10%. These results were further investigated for correlations between the amino acids
encoded by the trinucleotide repetitions and the codon
usage preferences reported for each organism in the
Codon Usage Database from the Kazuka DNA Research
Institute [38]. In all cases, the triplets analyzed encoded
for amino acids that were normally overrepresented in the
corresponding organism. The differences detected
between P. infestans and P. sojae-P.ramorum emerging in
our trinucleotide analysis were also corroborated by
codon usage frequencies.

a The

same constraints on minimum length cited for Table 1 were used.

Repeats containing motifs between 7 and 14 bp were
scarce in the three oomycetes transcriptome analyzed,
accounting for less than 1% of the total number of SSRs.
They did not merit further attention in our study because
of their low abundance. Regarding SSR lengths, we found
that di-, tetra- and penta-nucleotide motif types did not
exceed 30 bp (Table 4), while tri and hexanucleotides
were clearly longer in all organisms. Although P. sojae had
the longest SSR for di-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotide
repeat types, longer than reported for other organisms
(Karaoglu et al., 2004), only a very few of these lengths can
be considered "long microsatellites" (> 15 repetitions
[39]). The motif sequences of the longest SSRs are not

shared among organisms, indicating that this factor is
independent in each species. Thus, our results suggest that
long SSRs are absent from these consensus EST or transcripts sequences. The number of repeats found in SSR
loci ranged from 3 to 33, from 3 to 32 and from 3 to 15 in
P. infestans, P. sojae and P. ramorum, respectively. Most SSR
loci showed seven repeats or less (96% P. infestans, 98% P.
sojae and 99%P. ramorum), with a repeat number of four
being the most common in all species (Fig. 3).

P. ramorum, respectively, and their SSR distributions were
characterized. They included enzymes such as cell wall
degrading enzymes (cutinases, glucanses, polygalacturonases, pectate lyases and cellulases), elicitins and avirulence homolog proteins with conserved RXLR motifs, and
other secreted proteins potentially related to pathogenicity [7,40]. SSRs were also surveyed in two additional
sequence sets corresponding to constitutively expressed
genes: ribosomal and housekeeping genes such as actin,
cytochrome P450-like protein and NADH hydrogenase.
The results showed that the percentage of SSR-containing
sequences in the pathogenicity factors was not significantly different from that in the ribosomal and housekeeping genes (Table 5). The scarcity of SSRs in the

Primer design for EST-SSRs and databases
Sequences flanking microsatellites from each of the three
organisms were used to develop primer pairs using
Primer3 software [41]. For this first survey, the parameters
were not stringent since a high number of sequences were
analyzed. We produced primer pairs for 61.44%, 87.47%
and 88.97% of the SSRs from P. infestans, P. sojae and P.
ramorum respectively; not all the SSRs were located in
positions suitable for optimum design. Three different
primer pairs were generated for each SSR and deposited in
the developed database [30] with their sequences, the
consensus EST or transcript sequence (with the original
sequence ID) and a brief description of the amplifiable
SSR. These primers can be used to amplify the corresponding SSR region for diverse applications, so they constitute
a publicly available resource for future research. Of the
three primer pairs, only the first (the best score) was used
to analyze transferability.
in silico analysis of transferability
Primer pairs for each SSR locus were assayed in silico for
cross-transferability. Primers for each organism were
aligned against the consensus ESTs or transcript databases
from the other two organisms. Three criteria were established to filter the comparisons: (i) high degree of similarity (> 90%) between primer and aligned sequence; (ii)
primers aligning with only one sequence containing an
SSR; (iii) a hypothetical PCR product size longer than 100
bp. Of all the primers designed (8739), 7.5% appeared
transferable between at least two species. Not surprisingly,
most of the virtually transferable primers were found

most closely related species. However, 84 (~1 %) primers
were found to be virtually transferable among all three
species (Table 6).

Discussion
The present study was designed to create microsatellite
databases for P. infestans, P. sojae and P. ramorum, taking
advantage of publicly available sequences for these organisms. In the case of P. infestans, EST sequences were first
assembled and then explored for SSRs. For P. ramorum
and P. sojae, annotated transcripts from the available
whole genome sequences were used directly to search for
SSRs and to analyze the distribution and organization of
SSRs in the transcribed regions of these organisms.
Approximately 6–22% of the sequences contained SSRs,
which shows higher frequencies than previously reported
for plant ESTs [25,37,42], fungal endophytes [43] or other
higher eukaryotes [8,44]. However, these differences
might reflect the different criteria used to select the SSRs.
Repeat sequences of at least 12 bp for di-, tri- and tetranucleotides, and three or more repeated units for pentaand hexa-nucleotides, were chosen for this study. These
lengths were used because they have been considered the

minimum acceptable microsatellite lengths [34] and are
efficient thresholds for detecting high levels of polymorphism [22]. Our results showed that SSR lengths are very
restricted in the coding regions of oomycete genomes;
approximately 99% of all the SSRs analyzed were shorter
than 30 bp. Only a few SSRs had higher numbers of repeat
units, perhaps because of their location in well-conserved
regions of the genome. Strong evolutionary and functional constraints limit the expansion of microsatellite
repeats in expressed regions of the genome [45,46],
because longer repeats have higher mutation rates and
could therefore be less stable [47,48]. Short microsatellites are probably generated by random mutations and
then expanded by DNA polymerase slippage. Thus, the
base composition of a sequence that seeds the evolution
of repeats is expected to influence microsatellite density
[49,50]. Therefore, the similarities between SSR motifs
within oomycetes and between oomycetes and fungi may
indicate that specific common sequence composition
contributes to the evolution of SSRs.
Statistically, there were no quantitative differences in the
distributions of SSR motifs between P. sojae and P. ramorum. However, marked differences were found when these
two species were compared with P. infestans. This is particularly interesting because the frequency distribution of
SSRs does not follow a genus-wide pattern; if it is strongly
species-dependent, it could indicate evolutionary events
specific to the organisms compared. In addition, SSRs
derived from exonic regions, which are more conserved
than genomic SSRs, might consequently show only minor
differences in distribution among related species. Thus,
differences in genomic organization could explain the SSR
distributions observed in the organisms examined, reflecting the phylogenetic distances between them [29,51].
More sequence data on ESTs/transcripts will soon become
available for Stramenopiles, as P. infestans, P. capsici,

Pythium ultimum, and Hyaloperonospora parasitica are or
will be sequenced in the near future that will provide further resolution on the evolution of SSR motifs in Oomycete coding regions.
The most common SSRs comprised trinucleotide repeat
units with low repeat numbers. A wide variety of repeat
motifs were represented at high percentages in these trinucleotide arrays. The abundance of repeat motifs differed
slightly, especially between P. infestans and the other two
species; (AGC)n, (ACG)n and (AGG)n were the most
abundant triplets in all organisms but their abundances
differed among species. This finding was expected, since
EST or transcript-derived microsatellites are likely to be
conserved in frequency, abundance and distribution
across closely-related species [52]. A database search of all
possible trinucleotide repeat motifs (>20 bp) showed that
(AGG)n, (AAT)n and (ATC)n are relatively common in
fungi, but (ACG)n and (CCG)n are relatively rare [53].
Differences in abundance and density among trimeric
repeats could be explained by species-specific cellular factors that interact with the motifs and play an important
role in generating the repeats [18]. Among plant species,
the abundances of different repeat motifs in EST-derived
SSRs vary greatly. However, trinucleotide units with low
repeat numbers are common features of EST-SSRs
[25,37,42,54]. Our results suggest that Phytophthora spp.
might have a set of common motifs, as is the case with
fungi, whereas the motifs in oomycetes may vary widely,
as they do in plants.
High dinucleotide repeat abundances in whole genomes
have been reported for fungi, Drosophila,Caenorhabditis elegans and a subset of plant genomes [36,51,54,55]. Dinucleotide repeats have been characterized as being the most
important SSRs because of their higher mutation rates
[51]. This suggests an explanation for their high abundance in genomic regions and low abundance in coding
regions, which must be conserved to maintain functionality. On the other hand, many studies have reported that
trinucleotides are most abundant in coding regions of
higher eukaryotic genomes [46,56,57]. Previous studies
have shown that trinucleotide repeats predominate in
plant EST libraries, supporting our observations on
oomycetes [12,58]. Among all SSRs, expansions or deletions in coding regions can be tolerated for tri- and hexanucleotides, which do not perturb reading frames [36].
This could explain why the longest SSRs in all the organisms examined belong to these motif categories, although
the three-dimensional structure of a protein translated
from a sequence containing such SSRs would not necessarily be unchanged. Interestingly, our analyses showed
that glutamine is the amino acid encoded by the most
highly abundant repeat in P. sojae and P. ramorum: (CAG)n
. This agrees with previous reports on Drosophila, C. elegans

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/245

and yeast [36], in which the same glutamine-coding triplet was the most common in tandem triplet repeats. In
contrast, glutamic acid was encoded by the most common
repeat in P. infestans: (AAG)n . Like glutamine, this is also
one of the most common tandemly repeated amino acids
in the aforementioned organisms. Katti et al. [59] analyzed all the protein sequences from the SWISS-PROT
database for single amino acid repeats, tandem oligo-peptide repeats, and periodically conserved amino acids; the
results showed that repeats of glutamine, serine, glutamic
acid, glycine and alanine seem to be fairly well tolerated
in many proteins. Four of these five amino acids were
found in our analysis and have also been reported in
recent studies of complete genome coding sequences [36].
Such triplet repeat patterns in ORFs of oomycetes and
other organisms could reflect functional selection of
amino acid reiterations in the encoded proteins. Whole
genome analyses have shown that repeat stretches of
small/hydrophilic amino acids are more frequent in proteins [59]. The expansion of codons encoding such amino
acids might be better tolerated than the expansion of
hydrophobic amino acid stretches because they probably
would not change the three-dimensional protein conformation as drastically. Therefore, nucleotide composition
might strongly affect the structures and functions of
encoded proteins, and it could be a determining force in
the selection of SSRs in coding sequences.
We also explored the possibility that valuable information
for mapping and for diversity or population structure
studies could be obtained from these data. For this reason,
microsatellite markers were evaluated for in silico crosstransferability among all three species. Many studies on
organisms from different kingdoms have led to the development of markers amplifiable across species [34,44,54],
even among Phytophthora species [17]. To our knowledge,
this possibility has never been assessed in silico for any
organism (including oomycetes). SSRs designed from
EST/transcripts sequences are especially valuable owing to
their genome location, which implies constraints on
length, motif, abundance and flanking regions. The last of
these is of particular interest for characterizing interspecies genetic diversity using common primers. Therefore,
we designed primers for all SSR sets observed by species
and identified those that were potentially cross-transferable. This approach was similar to a virtual PCR and provided candidate SSRs for experimental screening. The
results revealed a small proportion of primers that could
theoretically be used as transferable molecular markers
(using a similarity criterion of 100%). This was an unexpected result because EST/transcript types of sequence are
highly conserved and there is a close phylogenetic relationship among the Phytophthora spp. [27]. However, if
the similarity criterion for alignment was less stringent
(90%), 653 primer pairs were virtually transferable

between at least two species. This number represents a
remarkably large, diverse reservoir of markers that is
potentially useful for diversity and population studies.
With far fewer primers, an acceptable level of polymorphism has been found in previous studies of different
organisms, where the primers are used to amplify a DNA
region that has undergone SSR expansion in one lineage
but not in related ones [8,54,60]. The transferability
results might suggest that the organization of oomycete
genomes shows marked variations. However, a more
plausible explanation could be that the evolutionary distance between the selected taxa is greater than in other systems or organisms in which SSRs have been shown to be
transferable (e.g. plants). Experimental validation of these
hypothetically transferable SSRs and their polymorphism
is on-going. This will verify the potential effectiveness of
this in silico tool for finding transferable molecular markers for evaluating intra- and inter-specific diversity,
instead of spending resources to validate them.
Evolutionary forces keep pathogen lineages and their
hosts in an arms race, as each evolves new strategies for
attack and defense [61]. The success of this arms race over
time depends on the mechanisms by which pathogenicity
factors evolve. Microsatellite mutation rates, ranging from
10-6 to 10-2 per generation, are higher than base substitution rates [10], and it is thus reasonable to assume that
their presence in pathogenicity factors may contribute to
variability in the relevant sequences [62]. In this study, we
surveyed SSR abundance and distribution in putative
pathogenicity factor sequences. The results were compared with SSR abundance and distribution in ribosomal
and housekeeping sequences, which are presumed to be
less variable because their fundamental functions in the
organism are conserved. However, our results did not
show higher SSR abundance in the pathogenicity factors.
Differences from reference sequences (ribosomal and
housekeeping) were not statistically significant (P > 0.05).
This suggests that SSRs probably do not make a clear contribution to functional changes in pathogenicity factors,
which allow P. infestans, P. sojae and P. ramorum to cause
disease, but our study does not rule out the possibility that
SSR polymorphisms may be present in pathogenicity
genes.

Conclusion
Databases for P. sojae, P. infestans and P. ramorum were
inexpensive sources of SSRs. In silico investigation of SSRs
is a significant step towards understanding the biological
functions and nature of these important portions of the
DNA. SSR markers are potentially useful tools for identifying Phytophthora species and for assessing genetic variation among populations. Evaluation of intraspecific
genetic variation in Phytophthora concomitant with equivalent studies of host genetic variation could allow the rela-

tionships between host genotype variability, Phytophthora
genotype and the selection pressures acting between them
to be established. An important direct application of this
study is as a resource for future population research.

Methods
Sources of ESTs and annotated transcript sequences
EST sequences from P. infestans (81974) were downloaded from the Phytophthora Functional Genomics
Database [31]. The annotated transcript sequences available for P. sojae (19276) and P. ramorum (16066) were
downloaded from the Department of Energy's Joint
Genome Institute [32]. These redundant ESTs and transcript sequence sets were obtained in FASTA format. In
addition, we downloaded 136, 318, and 171 sequences
corresponding to putative or validated pathogenicity factors from P. infestans (National Center for Biotechnology
Information [63]), P. sojae (Virginia Bioinformatics Institute [64]) and P. ramorum (DOE Joint Genome Institute
[32]). From the same databases, ribosomal and housekeeping gene sequences were obtained for each of the
organisms studied.
Masking and assembly of the ESTs sequences from P.
infestans
UniVec build # 3.2 was obtained from the NCBI web site
FTP directory [65] and the latest repetitions database RepBase [33] EST were masked using the cross-match utility.
PHRAP version 0.990329 was used to cluster the ESTs and
to generate consensus sequences. Parameters phrapminiscore 100 -minmatch 50 were used to generate consensus. The total consensus sequence count was 25965.
Scanning of non-redundant EST and transcript sequences
from P. infestans, P. sojae and P. ramorum for SSR
survey
Non-redundant EST and transcript sequences were
scanned using a local version of the Microsatellite Identification Tool (MISA) available from the Plant Genome
Resources Center (PGRC) [66]. This program searches for
both perfect and compound SSRs with 2 to 6 nucleotides
in the basic repeat unit. It records repeat numbers and SSR
locations inside the EST sequence and deposits these
results in an output file. SSR redundancy was minimized
by counting only a single match when there was more
than one record for the same SSR locus. Minimum SSR
length was determined by the number of repeats, which
were (2/6) (3/4) (4/3) (5/3) (6/3); the first digit refers to
the SSR repeat type and the second to the minimum
number of repeat units (Table 1). For example, (2/6)
means that a motif consisting of 2 bp and should have at
least 6 repeats to be considered a microsatellite in our
analysis. Pathogenicity factors, ribosomal genes and
housekeeping genes were also scanned for SSRs using the
same parameters (Table 6).

Total SSR numbers were normalized by calculating relative abundance. This was calculated as the number of SSRs
per Mb of sequence analyzed so that the three sequence
sets of different sizes could be compared. The relative density (bp/Mb) of each set of ESTs sequences was calculated
by dividing the number of base pairs in the sequences
(bp) contributed by each SSR by the total length of
sequences examined (Mb); see Figures 1 and 2

Primer design and cross-transferability
P3_in.pl and P3_out.pl perl scripts, which complement
the MISA program, were adapted and used for automated
selection and transfer of SSR-containing sequences from
the database to the Primer3 program. Parameters used for
the Primer3 program were as follows: optimal Tm of 57°C
with a minimum and maximum of 50°C and 64°C
respectively, and 50–75% GC content. The probability of
dimer or hair-loop formation was low. The size of the PCR
product is expected to be between 50 and 300 bp and no
secondary structure.

To search for cross-transferability between paired P.
infestans-P. sojae, P. infestans- P. ramorum and P. ramorumP. sojae, each designed primer pair from each species was
compared against all the SSR-containing sequences from
the other species. The EMBOSS 3.0 Primersearch utility
was used for this purpose. Cross-transferability among the
three species was assessed manually.
