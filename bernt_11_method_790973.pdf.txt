Abstract
Background: Changes in the order of mitochondrial genes are a good source of information for phylogenetic
investigations. Phylogenetic hypotheses are often supported by parsimonious mitochondrial gene order
rearrangement scenarios. CREx is a heuristic for computing short pairwise rearrangement scenarios for metazoan
mitochondrial gene orders. Different from other methods, CREx considers four types of rearrangement operations:
inversions, transpositions, inverse transpositions, and tandem duplication random loss operations.
Results: An extensive analysis of the CREx reconstructions for artificial data has been presented and it is shown
how the quality of the reconstructed rearrangement scenarios depends on the type of rearrangement model and
additional parameter values. Moreover, a fast method is proposed to apply CREx to a large number of gene orders
to find likely rearrangement scenarios and store them in a graph structure called RI-Graph. This method is applied
to analyse all known metazoan mitochondrial gene orders. It is shown that the obtained RI-Graph contains many
rearrangement scenarios that are described in the literature.
Conclusions: The prospects and limitations of CREx have been analysed empirically and a comparison with the
literature on gene order evolution highlights its benefits. The newly developed method to apply CREx to a large
number of gene orders is successful in computing an RI-graph that contains many rearrangement scenarios for
metazoan gene orders that have also been described in the literature. This shows that the new method is very
helpful for a fast analysis of a large number of gene orders which is relevant due to the strongly increasing
number of known gene orders.

Background
Phylogenetic hypotheses are often supported by the
computation of parsimonious scenarios of genome-wide
rearrangement operations. Especially mitochondrial gene
orders became a very fruitful source for such investigations as they are known for more than 1700 metazoan
species. Furthermore they exhibit a small and usually
preserved gene set [1]. Therefore, we focus in this paper
on the case of sets gene orders that all have the same

set of genes and do not have duplicated genes. It is
assumed that several types of rearrangement operations
have shaped the gene orders observed today. Inversions
and transpositions are well documented [2]. Also inverse
transposition, i.e., a transposition where the transposed
part is inverted, have been found several times [1], [3-5].
Recent studies add tandem duplication random loss
(TDRL) to the set of rearrangement operations that are
relevant for mitochondrial gene order evolution [6-10].
A TDRL consists of a tandem duplication, i.e., a duplication of a continuous segment of genes such that the original segment and its copy are consecutive, followed by
the loss of one copy of each of the redundant genes.

The reconstruction of the evolution of gene orders for
only three given gene orders is in almost all studied
cases a NP-hard problem [11,12], e.g., even when only
inversions are considered. This complicates studies considering combinations of different types of rearrangement operations in event based reconstruction methods,
e.g., [13]. Inversions and transpositions are the most
often considered genomic rearrangement operation for
phylogenetic reconstruction, e.g., [14]. But ideally, all
four relevant types of rearrangement operations should
be regarded.
It can be found that some gene clusters are preserved
during gene order evolution – be it for functional reasons or just by chance. Hence, several studies have
investigated gene order rearrangement problems under
the constraint that gene clusters are preserved. Typically,
gene clusters are defined by a formal model in these
studies. For gene orders without deleted or duplicated
elements gene clusters are most often defined as common intervals[15], i.e., a set of genes that occur continuously in each of the considered gene orders. The strong
interval tree (SIT) is a data structure to efficiently
represent the set of all common intervals of two or
more permutations. Based on SITs an efficient exact
algorithm for computing parsimonious inversion only
preserving rearrangement scenarios for two given gene
orders is presented in [16]. An extension of the SIT
data structure is proposed in [17] for computing shortest preserving inversion scenarios for more than two
gene orders. An interesting approach to identify inversions and transpositions for pairwise gene order comparisons is to search for certain templates within the
SIT [18]. In [19] the algorithm CREx (Common Interval
Rearrangement Explorer) is presented which heuristically infers a preserving rearrangement scenario for two
gene orders by considering all four mentioned kinds of
rearrangement operations. One principle of CREx is to
identify different patterns that correspond to the different types of rearrangement operations in the SIT data
structure. Extensions to CREx and the TreeREx
approach for automatically computing the rearrangements in a given phylogenetic tree are presented in
[20]. In this paper we do an extensive study of CREx on
simulated data. Even though CREx has already successfully been applied in several studies to biological data, e.
g., [21] , such a systematic study is missing so far. We
also propose a method for applying CREx to a large
number of mitochondrial gene orders to identify likely
rearrangement scenarios. The reconstructions that are
obtained with the new method are stored in a so called
rearrangement inventory graph (RI-graph). The reconstructions in the RI-graph are evaluated with a comprehensive comparison to reconstructions published in the
literature.

Materials and methods
Gene order comparison with CREx in a nutshell

In the following we shortly introduce CREx and the SIT
data structure. For more details see [19,20]. CREx compares two gene orders without duplicated or deleted
genes which can be regarded as signed permutations, i.
e., permutations with a sign (+/–) added to each element representing the orientation of the gene. A set of
(unsigned) elements appearing consecutively in two
gene orders is a common interval. Note that for the definition of a common interval the orientation and order
of its elements can differ in the two permutations. Two
common intervals overlap if they have a nonempty
intersection and none is included in the other. A common interval is strong if it does not overlap any other
common interval. The strong interval tree (SIT) is the
graph where each node corresponds to a strong common interval and is connected to the node representing
the smallest superset of genes. A node is linear increasing (resp. decreasing) if the strong common intervals
corresponding to its children are in the same (resp.
reverse) order in the two compared permutations and
prime otherwise. Each node of the SIT has a sign. The
sign of a leaf node is given by the relative orientation of
the corresponding element in the permutations. The
sign of a linear node is + if it is linear increasing and –
if it is linear decreasing. A prime node inherits the sign
of a linear parent node and is + if no such node exists.
Consider the signed permutation π = (6 9 7 10 8 1 -4
5 -3 -2) and the identity permutation. In addition to the
common interval {1,…, 10} and the singletons the two
permutations have the following seven common intervals: {2, 3} {2, 3, 4, 5} {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {3, 4, 5}, {4, 5} {7, 8,
9, 10} {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. The common intervals {2, 3} and
{3, 4, 5} are not strong because they overlap. The
remaining common intervals are strong and define the
structure of the SIT as shown in Figure 1. The node
corresponding to the strong common interval {2, 3, 4, 5}
is decreasing because the child strong common intervals

occur in the opposite order in π, i.e. in π they are in the
order {4, 5}, {3}, {2} whereas they are in the order {2},
{3}, {4, 5} in the identity. CREx is based on the observation that the application of a single rearrangement
operation leads to a pattern in the SIT which is specific
for the type of the rearrangement, e.g., a transposition
leads to a linear node with two linear children of opposite sign and a TDRL always leads to a prime node
(unless its effect can also be described by a transposition). CREx reconstructs a short rearrangement scenario
by identifying these patterns in the SIT in a specific
order. Special care is taken for prime nodes with
inverted elements since these cannot be explained by
TDRLs only. CREx also includes the possibility for alternative scenarios, e.g., three inversions as an alternative
for a transposition or several possible scenarios for
prime nodes. Algorithm CREx, a tutorial, and several
detailed examples are available online.
CREx represents rearrangement scenarios from π to s
in a tree data structure, defined recursively as follows. A
scenario is either an ordered list of scenarios, a set of
alternative scenarios, a set of pairwise commuting scenarios, or a single atomic rearrangement operation. For
a rearrangement scenario from π to s it holds that each
linear lists of rearrangements generated from a traversal
of the rearrangement tree where the (sub)scenarios of
an ordered list are applied in the given order, the (sub)
scenarios of a commuting scenario are applied in any
order, only one out of alternative (sub)scenarios transforms π into s.
For the permutation above CREx matches first the
transposition pattern on the root node of the SIT and
reports the transposition of the sets {1,…, 5} and {6,…,
10}. Next CREx adds the inverse transposition of the
elements {2, 3} on the other side of {4, 5} to the rearrangement scenario since the corresponding pattern
matches that for the node {2, 3, 4, 5}. The last pattern
matching on a linear node is the inversion pattern of
node {5}. Finally, the difference in the elements corresponding to the prime node add a TDRL that duplicates
the elements {7, 8, 9, 10} and keeps the elements {7, 8}
(resp. {9, 10}) in the first (resp. second) copy.
Mitochondrial gene arrangement data set

The data set used in this paper is based on the 1 701
complete metazoan mitochondrial genomes in NCBI
RefSeq [22], release 36 (July 2009). Since there exist several misannotations in the NCBI RefSeq data the tRNA
annotation has been postprocessed with ARWEN [23]
and tRNA-scan SE [24] (for more details see [25]). The
gene arrangement data set consists of 185 unique gene
orders having the standard set of 37 genes common to
most metazoan mitochondrial genomes [1] representing
1 458 gene orders in total. The relatively small number

Page 3 of 11

of unique gene orders is mainly due to the fact that for
most Chordata species where the gene order is known
orders it is the same. But also for species in some other
phyla several species have the same gene order (e.g.,
birds and some deep sea fishes).
Simulated gene arrangement data sets

Each simulated rearrangement scenario is constructed
by applying r Î [1 : 10] random rearrangements starting
at the identity permutation of length n = 100. A given
probability vector p = (pI, pT, piT, pTDRL) specifies the
probabilities that a rearrangement is an inversion (pI), a
transposition (pT), an inverse transposition (piT), or a
TDRL (pTDRL). Random rearrangements, i.e., inversions,
transpositions, or inverse transpositions, are chosen with
equal probability from the set of all possible respective
operations. A random TDRL is generated by choosing
uniformly at random the duplicated interval and for
each element if it is deleted in the first or second copy.
We have considered six rearrangement models: (I)
inversions only, (T) transpositions only, (iT) inverse
transpositions only, (TDRL) TDRLs only, (IT) inversions
and transpositions both with the same probability, i.e., p
= (0.5, 0.5,0, 0), (All) all four types of rearrangement
operations with p = (0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.1). Furthermore,
data sets have been constructed where each rearrangement operation affects the order of at most w Î {10, 20,
…, 100} genes. For each combination of rearrangement
model, r, and w, 1000 data sets have been simulated, i.e.,
altogether 600 000.
Each pair of the identity permutation with one of the
generated permutations has been used as input for
CREx. Let S be the set of rearrangement operations in
the simulated scenario and C the rearrangement scenario computed by CREx. The quality of the CREx scenario is measured by precision = (|S ∩ C|)/|C| and
recall = (|S ∩ C|)/|S| for |S| ≠ 0 ∧ |C| ≠ 0 (if |S| = |C|
= 0 precision and recall are 1, if |S| = 0 ∧ |C| ≠ 0 or |S|
≠ 0 ∧ |C| = 0 precision and recall are 0). The “intersection” operation between S and C is computed with a
corresponding function provided by TreeREx [20] which
determines the longest common suffix between S and C
or more precisely between any pair of the linear lists of
rearrangements generated from a traversal of the tree
representations of S and C.
Building the rearrangement inventory graph

Let Π = {π 1 ,…, π k } be a set of gene orders. A directed
graph G = (Π, El ∪ Ep) — called the rearrangement inventory graph (RI-graph)— is defined on the set of nodes Π
where the edges represent rearrangement scenarios reconstructed by CREx. Recall, the aim is to represent only
those rearrangement scenarios that can be considered as
likely candidates for rearrangements that might have

Bernt and Middendorf BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12(Suppl 9):S6
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/S9/S6

happened during evolution. Therefore, edge set El contains
only edges between two permutations πi , πj for which the
corresponding SIT has only linear nodes. Furthermore, for
at least one of the two permutations, e.g., πi , it must hold
that there does not exist a third permutation in Π which
has a smaller distance to πi than the distance between πi
and π j . The distance d between two permutations is
defined as the length of the corresponding CREx scenarios
(in case of alternative scenarios the shorter alternative is
regarded). More exactly, two nodes πi, πj Î V, with 1 ≤ i ≠
j ≤ k are connected by an edge in El if, i) the SIT for {πi,
πj} is linear, and ii) either there is no gene order πh Î Π,
with i ≠ h ≠ j such that the SIT for {πh, πj} is linear and d
(πi, πh) <d(πi, πj) or the analogous statement holds for j
instead of i. Observe, that the scenarios corresponding to
edges in El do not contain any TDRL operation. Hence,
edge set Ep is introduced to consider likely rearrangement
scenarios containing a TDRL operation. Since TDRL
operations are considered as rare, scenarios that have
more than one TDRL operation are not considered for
introducing an edge to Ep. Formally, there exists an edge
(πi, πj) Î Ep if, i) the rearrangement scenario from πi to πj
includes exactly one TDRL, ii) πi and πj are in different
connected components of the graph (Π, E l ), and iii)
d(p i , p j ) = min{d(p h , p j )} . The second condition states
h∈[1:k]
that a scenario with TDRL operations is not considered
when the corresponding permutations are connected in
(Π, El), i.e., they are already related to each other with a
likely scenarios not requiring TDRL operations.
Representation of the rearrangement inventory graph

The nodes of the RI-Graph are shown as rectangles
labelled with the accession number of one representative
species and the number of species with the same gene
order in parentheses if larger than one. Edges are
coloured with respect to the represented rearrangement
scenario such that the fractions of TDRLs, inversions,
and transpositions correspond, respectively, to the intensity of the colours red, green, and blue. For the purpose
of colouring an inverse transposition is counted as an
inversion plus a transposition. The direction of a scenario
that contains a TDRL is indicated by a directed edge.
Each edge is labelled with the corresponding unique
identifiers of the rearrangements that are predicted by
CREx. An index of the identifiers of all predicted rearrangements is given in Additional file 1. The layout of the
graph was done manually starting from an initial layout
computed with Graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org).

Results and discussion
Empirical analysis of CREx reconstructions

An empirical analysis of the quality of the reconstructions
of CREx on the simulated data is presented in the following for the different models of genome rearrangement.

Page 4 of 11

Clearly, it can not be expected that CREx is able to
reconstruct the simulated scenarios for a large number r
of rearrangement operations. The reason is that there
exist too many possible rearrangements and also the
shortest possible rearrangement scenario between two
simulated permutations is not necessarily the simulated
one. The hope is, that for a small number of rearrangement operations CREx can deliver good reconstructions.
In that case such reconstructions might be useful as a
basis for the analysis of the phylogeny even for a large
number species (as done in the second part of the results
section) because CREx is also very fast. For the 600 000
reconstructions CREx needed 21 min 54 s on a laptop
with a 2.0 GHz processor, i.e., one reconstruction in ≈
10–3 s on average.
Reconstruction quality

Boxplots of the precision of the CREx reconstructions
for different numbers of rearrangement operations r are
shown in Figure 2 (left). The corresponding plots for
the recall values are omitted (see Additional File 1),
because they are very similar to the corresponding precision values, i.e., the average precision and recall values
differ by ≤ 0.05.
It can be seen that for r = 1 the correct scenario was
always found by CREx. For r = 2 and I (resp.. TDRL)
the majority of the rearrangement scenarios. i.e., 686
(resp. 710), has been reconstructed correctly. For the
rearrangement models IT and All the correct scenario
has been reconstructed for considerably more than one
third of the data sets (425 and 435). A correct scenario
has been reconstructed for less than one third (306 resp.
211) of the data sets for T and iT. For a large number
of rearrangements (r > 9 and I, r > 8 and IT, r > 5 and
TDRL, All, r > 4 and T, r > 3 and iT) a reconstruction
with a recall of one could not be done for a single data
set. But often at least a part of the rearrangement scenario could still be reconstructed, e.g., for at least 678 of
the data sets generated with I for r ≤ 10 and the majority of the IT (T, iT, TDRL) data sets for r < 6 (r < 4, r <
2, r < 3).
Thus, for small values of r the quality of the reconstructed scenarios is good, but decreases for larger
values of r. CREx is able to reconstruct at least a part of
the simulated rearrangement scenario for many data
sets with medium values of r. This is an interesting
observation, because a partially correct reconstruction
might suffice for the correct operation of TreeREx [20]
which is based on determining common suffixes in rearrangement scenarios leading to a permutation which has
been determined with CREx. The results are apparently
better when no transpositions or inverse transpositions
are applied. Although these first results for simulated
data seem not to be very promising, additional biologically relevant criteria and constraints to the

models; left: precision for different rearrangement numbers r Î [1 : 10]; right: precision for different numbers of prime nodes p of the SIT.

rearrangement models can be identified where CREx’
performance is better.
Sensitivity to strong interval tree structure

In this subsection it is shown that the reconstruction
quality depends to a large extent on the properties of
the SIT corresponding to the pair of permutations analysed by CREx. Figure 2 (right) shows the precision for
the simulated data sets in relation to the number of
prime nodes in the corresponding SITs. Plots for recall
are given in Additional File 1 (difference of the average
values ≤ 0.06).
The results for the TDRL model differ from the
results of the other rearrangement models in an increasing reconstruction quality for larger values of p. This is
discussed first. The cases with p = 0 generated with
TDRLs correspond to one of the rare cases (155x for r
= 1 and 19x times for k = 2) where the random TDRL
has the same effect as a transposition. If the random
TDRLs do not overlap they create separate prime nodes,
i.e., k = p (the inverse does not necessarily hold). Such
cases can easily be reconstructed by CREx. This is confirmed by the observation that for p = k the precision
and recall values have been 1 in all but two cases for k
= 2. Furthermore, the fraction of data sets with k = p
increases with p, from 0.11 for p = 1 to 0.6 for p = 4.
This explains the difference of the results for large p for
the TDRL model. The reconstructed scenarios of CREx
are mostly correct when the SIT has no prime node.
This holds for all rearrangement models. But, when the
SIT has a prime node, a large fraction of the reconstructed rearrangements is not correct.
There are 10833 random data with prime node free
SIT. For 8101 (≈ 75%) of these data sets the CREx
reconstruction is correct and at least partially correct

for 9 616 (≈ 89%). For the remaining 49 167 data sets,
which have a prime node in the SIT, the CREx reconstruction is correct only 2128 (≈ 4%) times and at least
a part of the reconstructed scenario was correct for only
17 741 (≈ 36%) of these data sets. For r = 1 the SIT is,
except for TDRL, always prime node free. But also for
the data sets with r > 1 the absence of prime nodes in
the SIT is still a good indicator for the quality of CREx’
reconstructions. This is, ≈ 53% correct (resp. ≈ 79% partially correct) reconstructions for data sets with prime
node free SIT compared to only ≈ 7% (resp.. ≈ 35%)
when the SIT has prime nodes.
The presented results clearly show that the absence of
prime nodes in the SIT is a good indicator for the quality of the rearrangement scenario reconstructed by
CREx. This is remarkable because pairwise comparisons
of metazoan mitochondrial gene arrangements often
correspond to prime node free SITs and most of the
gene orders take part in at least one such comparison
(see Additional File 1).
Different rearrangement sizes

The probability of the rearrangements may depend on
additional properties in real world scenarios, e.g., short
rearrangement operations are found more often [26]
(and references therein). In the following the influence
of the length (measured as the number w of influenced
genes) of the rearrangement operations on the reconstruction quality of CREx is analysed (Figure 3). It can
be seen that the reconstructions of CREx are of much
better quality for smaller values of w. When comparing
the unrestricted case (w = 100) and the case w = 10 an
improvement of the average precision and recall of at
least 0.44 was measured for all values r > 2. Of course
the structure of the SIT depends on the applied

numbers of rearrangements r and different numbers of affected elements w; averages are computed over the results of all five rearrangement
models for each combination of r and w.

rearrangements. For short rearrangement operations the
number of simulated data sets without prime nodes
increases, e.g., 53 819 data sets for w > 50 and 88558
for w ≤ 50 are prime node free. Thus, the effects of
increased reconstruction quality in the case of prime
node absence and shorter rearrangement operations are
not independent. See [27] for a formal study of the relation of rearrangement length and the properties of the
generated gene clusters. The presented results indicate
that the quality of CREx’ reconstructions is improved
for gene orders that evolved with short rearrangements.
Clearly, since there is no accepted model for mitochondrial gene order evolution this does not necessarily
imply an improved reconstruction quality of CREx for
mitochondrial gene orders.
Inventory of metazoan mitochondrial gene order
rearrangements

The RI-Graph has been computed for the set of all 185
unique complete Metazoan gene orders. The computation needed 30s on a laptop with a 2.0 GHz CPU. The
185 nodes of the resulting RI-Graph are organised in
several connected components. Most of the connected
components are small: 29 nodes are singletons, nine
components contain two nodes, six components contain
three nodes, there exists one component of size five,
and one of size eight. Additionally, there are two large
components containing together more than half of the
nodes. One of these components has 45 nodes and
represents, with the exception of one Priapulid, gene
orders from arthropod species. The other large component contains 62 nodes which correspond to gene

orders of Chordata plus one Xenoturbellida and one
Hemichordata.
In the following three large connected components of
the RI-Graph are analysed in more detail. A more comprehensive analysis of the results is given in [25]. Note,
that the study presented in the following is not intended
to be phylogenetically conclusive.
Mollusca

The mollusc gene orders are organised in five connected
components of size greater than one and three singletons nodes (S. lobatum, G. eborea, and P. dolabrata).
Scenarios for five gastropod gene orders are given in
the connected component shown in Figure 4 (left). I19
and I20 are presumably caused by tRNA annotation
errors since ARWEN and tRNAscan already report five
differently oriented tRNAs for NC_01022. Hence, we
exclude B. Tenagophila from the following discussions.
The transpositions T100 and T102-104 are given in
[28]. Transposition T101 suggest a previously unreported alternative scenario. Assuming the tree topology
given in [28] a parsimony analysis of the presented
results suggest that the gene arrangement of C. nemoralis can not be ancestral. In addition to the three other
gene orders the gene arrangement separated by T100
from C. nemoralis, by T101 from B. glabrata, and by
T102 from A. coerulea is a putative ancestral gene
order. But note that every unrooted tree topology
including the four species is equally parsimonious.
The largest connected component of mollusc gene
orders (right part of Figure 4) contains gene orders from
Gastropoda, Cephalopoda, and one Chitonid. Transpositions T16-19 and inversion I4 are reconstructed as

reported in [29], inverse transposition iT4 is given there
as two separate inversions. Note that the CREx scenarios
between the gene orders of O. vulgaris, H. rubra, and I.
obsoleta have many common rearrangements. This proposes the gene order separated by iT4 from I. obsoleta,
by T18 from O. vulgaris, and by T16, T17 from H.
rubra as the ancestral gene arrangement for at least two
of the three gene arrangements (most likely of the two
Gastropoda). Assuming any of the three gene orders as
ancestral would not be parsimonious. TDRL7 is presented in [6]. The scenario to N. macromphalus is proposed as “transposition of two large blocks and
transposition of F” instead of TDRL8, but transposition
T20 is reported equivalently in [30].
Arthropoda

The gene orders of the Arthropoda are clustered in nine
connected components. The component containing 45 of
the 77 unique arthropod gene orders is shown in Figure 5.
The subgraph defined by the nodes NC_002010,
NC_000844, and NC_002355 and nodes which are only
adjacent to one of these three nodes (plus one chain of
nodes — NC_011243, NC_007010, NC_006081 — connected to NC_000844) is given in the upper part of the figure. The remaining part of the connected component is
presented in the lower part. The component contains two
unique gene orders representing Hexapoda and Crustacea
(Pancrustacea). That is, NC_000844 represents 90 Hexapod and 14 Crustacean gene orders and node NC_012421
represents gene orders of two Hexapoda and one Crustacea. The gene order corresponding to node NC_000844 is
considered to be the ancestral Pancrustacean gene order
[31] and the gene order of L. polyphemus (NC_002010) is
regarded as the ancestral arthropod gene order [32].

Several rearrangements that have been found occur
several times between different pairs of permutations.
Therefore, some of these rearrangements can be found
several times in the literature. These are for example i)
T26 is a swap of I and Q, e.g. [33,34], ii) iT21 is an
inverse transposition of L2[1,35], iii) T58 is a transposition of M and the pair I, Q [36], and iv) T2 is swap of P
and T, e.g., [8,33]. These rearrangements are of great
interest because they have been found several times
between or within different taxonomic groups and may
be examples of convergent or synapomorphic rearrangements, as discussed in [37]. The results presented here
will be of great help to investigate such problems.
First, some rearrangements shown in the lower part of
Figure 5 are analysed. Using the presented method
CREx automatically found TDRLs 16,18,20, and 21
which are striking examples of the tandem duplication
random loss model of genome rearrangement. TDRLs
20 and 21 have been presented in [8,9] differing only by
the exclusion of a single tRNA from the TDRLs favouring an additional transposition of the tRNA in both
cases. This is because the control region is used in these
studies as additional evidence. It is interesting that
seven (five) transpositions would be necessary for an
alternative explanation of TDRL20 (resp. TDRL21).
Three TDRLs are needed for the rearrangements in the
opposite direction in both cases. Note that [38] postulated “at least 10 translocations” for the rearrangements
leading to C. Coleoptrata. In [39] tandem duplication
random loss was discussed as a possible cause of the
rearrangement in the undescribed Lepidopsocrid species,
but the actual TDRL (18) is given here for the first time.
In [40] the gene orders of C. destructor and D. pulex

have been compared and different positions for eleven
genes have been noticed where for two genes inversion
is involved. “For nine of the translocations, the ’duplication/random loss’ mechanism” was suggested to be

plausible and “a minimum of five independent duplication/random loss events” have been postulated. The
automatic reconstruction using CREx – iT22, iT23,
TDRL16 – matches the description perfectly. But

potential misannotation of the V and the rRNAs in S.
arsenjevi, S. mantis, and M. japonicus make further
investigations necessary. Instead of TDRL19 two transpositions are proposed in [3], but iT28 is given equivalently. In [10] the gene orders of L. polyphemus and N.
annularus have been compared and a tandem duplication non-random loss rearrangement and a transposition
have been proposed. That is in each copy only genes on
the same strand are lost (with one exception). CREx
reconstructs the same rearrangements (T141 and
TDRL22) but with an intermediate step via the gene
order of Nothopuga sp. by transposition T136 [9]. T144
and iT29 are reconstructed as in [5], where it was
speculated that the transposition is derived from the
pre-”non random loss” tandem duplicated gene arrangement that gave rise to the N. annularus gene order.
Rearrangement counts

Table 1 shows the numbers of rearrangements operations found in the analysed connected components of
the RI-Graph, i.e., without the components containing
Deuterostomia. Note, that the total number of unique
rearrangements can be less than the sum of the corresponding numbers of known, different and new rearrangement operations, because the same rearrangement can
occur several times in the RI-Graph and might be
counted differently for different pairs gene orders. The
strength of the proposed RI-Graph approach is shown
by the fact that most of the proposed rearrangements
are likely to be correct in the sense that they are in
agreement with the literature. Within the analysed components a high number of transpositions have been
found. This is in agreement with the results presented
in [4]. Also [37] manually identified 43 transpositions
within the presented 67 comparisons of mitochondrial
gene orders of Hymenoptera. For two bacterial genomes
also a high number of transpositions was reported in
[41].
We would like to stress the point that these findings
are apparently in disagreement with weighting schemes
which put more weight on transpositions, e.g., [13,42].
This is done to avoid a bias favouring transpositions
since they are argued to be “observed much less

indicate that it is necessary to re-examine — at least for
intra phylum comparisons — the weighting schemes
that are typically used in the literature for the analysis
of mitochondrial gene order rearrangements.

Conclusions
The quality of the mitochondrial gene order rearrangement scenarios reconstructed with CREx has been analysed in an extensive study on artificial gene orders that
have been simulated with different rearrangement models. The four type of rearrangement operations - inversion, transposition, inverse transposition, and tandem
duplication random loss (TDRL) — that are relevant for
mitochondrial gene order evolution have been considered. It was shown that the absence of prime nodes in
the strong interval tree (SIT) and a not too large number
of genes involved in the rearrangement operations are
good criteria indicating reliable CREx reconstructions.
Based on the simulation results a method has been
proposed that can be used for automatically analysing a
large number of mitochondrial gene orders in order to
find a likely subset of scenarios from pairwise gene
order comparisons. The found scenarios are stored in
an RI-Graph data structure. The proposed method was
applied to all known metazoan mitochondrial gene
orders resulting in an RI-Graph where most gene orders
within the same phylum are connected. The potential of
the new method was shown by the large agreement with
the literature on gene order rearrangements within the
Protostomia.
Mitochondrial gene arrangement data are mostly still
analysed manually by biologists [37]. Such manual analyses are valuable and indispensable, but the handling of
the huge amount of available data is at least tedious and
may also be considered as impossible. Therefore, usually
only a very small number of gene arrangements is compared (with notable exceptions [9,37]), only a subset of
the genes is evaluated (usually tRNAs are excluded), or
only a part of the arrangements is compared (usually all
species are compared to a putative ancestral gene order
[37], or based on a phylogenetic tree [9]). In this way
the phylogenetic signal which is or is not contained in
gene order data can not be properly analysed or important alternative rearrangement scenarios may be missed.
The new method facilitates the automatic analysis of
gene orders and the reconstruction of rearrangement
scenarios. Within less than a minute the results for the
complete mitochondrial data set can be computed. It
was shown here that CREx allows for a comprehensive
analysis of the rearrangements, within the connected
components, solving some of the problems mentioned
above, in an unprecedented and efficient way.

Furthermore, the possibility to identify possible ancestral
states and cases of convergent evolution has been indicated. For future work it is promising to refine and
extend the proposed method, e.g. the inclusion of methods for the handling of missing genes or duplicates.
