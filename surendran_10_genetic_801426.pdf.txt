Anopheles sundaicus complex in Sri Lanka with
morphological characteristics attributed to
Anopheles subpictus species B

Abstract
Background: Anopheles subpictus sensu lato, a widespread malaria vector in Asia, is reportedly composed of four
sibling species A - D. Mosquitoes morphologically identified as belonging to the Subpictus complex were collected
from different locations near the east coast of Sri Lanka, and specific ribosomal DNA sequences determined to
validate their taxonomic status.
Methods: Anopheles subpictus s.l. larvae and blood-fed adults were collected from different locations in the Eastern
province and their sibling species status was determined based on published morphological characteristics. DNA
sequences of the D3 domain of 28 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and the internal transcribed spacer -2 (ITS-2) of
mosquitoes morphologically identified as An. subpictus sibling species A, B, C and D were determined.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis based on D3 domain of rDNA resulted in two clades: one clade with mosquitoes
identified as An. subpictus species A, C, D and some mosquitoes identified as species B, and another clade with a
majority of mosquitoes identified as species B with D3 sequences that were identical to Anopheles sundaicus
cytotype D. Analysis of ITS-2 sequences confirmed a close relationship between a majority of mosquitoes identified
as An. subpictus B with members of the An. sundaicus complex and others identified as An. subpictus B with
An. subpictus s.l.
Conclusions: The study suggests that published morphological characteristics are not specific enough to identify
some members of the Subpictus complex, particularly species B. The sequences of the ITS-2 and D3 domain of
rDNA suggest that a majority that were identified morphologically as An. subpictus species B in the east coast of Sri
Lanka, and some identified elsewhere in SE Asia as An. subpictus s.l., are in fact members of the Sundaicus complex
based on genetic similarity to An. sundaicus s.l. In view of the well-known ability of An. sundaicus s.l. to breed in
brackish and fresh water and its proven ability to transmit malaria in coastal areas of many Southeast Asian
countries, the present findings have significant implications for malaria control in Sri Lanka and neighbouring
countries.

Background
Anopheles culicifacies species E is the major vector of
malaria in Sri Lanka [1]. However Anopheles subpictus
s.l. also plays a role in transmitting Plasmodium vivax

and Plasmodium falciparum in many parts of Sri Lanka
[1-4] as well as in Southeast Asia and India [5,6]. The
taxon An. subpictus is reported to be a species complex
comprising four members viz. species A, B, C and D in
India [5,7]. The four members of this complex have
been described as possessing characteristic paracentric
fixed inversions on the X-chromosome viz. species
A (X+ a , + b), species B (Xa, b), species C (Xa, +b ) and
species D (X+ a , b) [5,7]. Additionally, stage-specific

morphometric characteristics e.g. the number of ridges
in egg floats, larval mesothoracic seta 4, pupal setae and
ornamentation of the palpi of adult females, have been
reported to be useful for differentiating An. subpictus
sibling species in field studies [7]. Initial studies based
on a single inversion in the X chromosome suggested
the presence of An. subpictus species A and B in Sri
Lanka [8]. Subsequent studies based on the numbers of
egg ridges indicated the presence of all four sibling species in the country [9]. Members of the complex differ
in breeding site and feeding preference and seasonal
abundance. The bio-ecological differences between
members of the An. subpictus complex in Sri Lanka [1]
and elsewhere [5] have been recently reviewed.
Although all four species of An. subpictus are reported
to breed in fresh and brackish waters in India, species B
is mainly reported to breed in brackish waters [5,10]
and predominate in coastal areas [7,11]. The coastal
populations of the Subpictus complex have been particularly incriminated as malaria vectors in India [12,13]
and Sri Lanka [8]. An. subpictus, including species B,
has previously been detected in Eastern Sri Lanka
[14,15]. An. subpictus species B has been specifically
implicated in transmitting malaria in the coastal areas of
the Puttalam district in the west coast of Sri Lanka [8].
The predominantly brackish water breeding Anopheles
sundaicus s.l. is a major vector of malaria in coastal
areas of Southeast Asia and Bangladesh [16,17]. Anopheles sundaicus s.l. was also an important vector of
malaria along the east coast of India, including the state
of Tamil Nadu (situated in close proximity to Sri Lanka)
until DDT spraying largely eliminated it from mainland
India, confining it more to the Andaman and Nicobar
islands [17,18]. Anopheles sundaicus s.l. has never previously been detected in Sri Lanka. The taxon An. sundaicus is reported to exist as a species complex
comprising four cytological forms (A-D) and four molecular forms namely An. sundaicus s.s., Anopheles epiroticus, An. sundaicus cytotype D and An. sundaicus E
[17-19] that occupy fresh and brackish water habitats.
Anopheles vagus is a species related to An. subpictus
s.l. and An. sundaicus s.l. that is classified under the
same subgenus Cellia and series Pyretophorous. It has
been implicated as a secondary malaria vector elsewhere
in the Indian subcontinent [20] and is present in
Sri Lanka [3,21].
Morphological properties are widely used to identify
and classify mosquito species in field studies because
large numbers of samples can be processed without the
need for specialized and expensive equipment, which is
a common drawback in resource-limited laboratories.
However genetic characterization provides the more
definitive identification. DNA sequences that give rise to
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) are widely used for phylogenetic

Page 2 of 9

analysis of closely related organisms including mosquitoes [22,23]. This is because eukaryotic organisms contain many tandemly repeated copies of rRNA genes that
tend to homogenize nucleotide sequences within panmictic species but diverge in sequence between reproductively isolated species. In this context, the expansion
loops of 28 S ribosomal RNA, such as the D3 domain,
show significantly greater variability between species
than core structures. Even greater variability due to
more rapid evolution is found in the non-coding internally transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences such as ITS-2,
which lies between the 5.8 S and 28 S RNA genes. The
D3 and ITS-2 sequences of mosquitoes morphologically
identified as An. subpictus species B collected from different coastal locations in the Eastern province of Sri
Lanka, and the importance of the findings for understanding malaria transmission in Sri Lanka and elsewhere in Asia are reported here.

Methods
Mosquito collection and identification of sibling species
of An. subpictus

Blood-fed adult anopheline mosquitoes were collected
in January and August 2009 from four collection sites
in three locations viz. Oluvil (one site within ≈2 km
from the coast; 7° 21” 44.41’ N: 81° 50” 42.68’ E), Chenkalady (one site ≈ 4 km from the coast; 7° 33” 54.93’ N:
81° 36” 44.61’ E) and Muthur (two sites: an inland area
≈ 8 km from the coast: 8° 25” 29.48’ N: 81° 16” 00.97’
E; and another < 1 km from the coast: 8° 27” 23.90’ N:
81° 15” 33.91’ E) in the respective districts of Ampara,
Batticaloa and Trincomalee of the Eastern province of
Sri Lanka (Figure 1) using cattle baited hut and cattle
baited net collections. Larval forms were also collected
from a brackish water body in Kallady (< 1 km from
the coast and contiguous with the Batticaloa lagoon; 7°
43’07.16” N; 81°42’31.28” E) (Figure 1) as previously
described [14].
The collected adults were brought to the Zoology
laboratory of the Eastern University and identified as
An. subpictus s.l. using published keys [6,24]. Prominent
characteristics used for identification were wings with
contrasting pale and dark scales, leading margin of wing
with at least 4 separate dark areas characteristic of Subgenus Cellia, hind tarsomers 3, 4 and 5 not entirely
white scaled, femur and tibia not speckled, foretarsi with
broad pale bands crossing joints, palps with preapical
dark band equal to or slightly less than the length of
apical pale band. Larvae collected at Kallady were
screened for reported characteristics of mesothoracic
seta 4 (seta 4 M; bifurcate for An. subpictus species A
and B but the latter with shorter and thinner branches)
for identifying sibling species of the Subpictus complex
[7], and reared in the laboratory until they became

adults. Facilities and expertise were not available for
determining polytene chromosome banding patterns
during this investigation and therefore only morphological characteristics were used in identification. Identified
blood-fed females were maintained individually and single female F1 progenies were raised as described previously [25]. Sibling species status of females laying eggs
was determined through the reported number of ridges
in the floats of egg that characterize the different species

i.e. species A, 31-36; species B, 16-20; species C, 25-29
and species D, 21-24 [7]. Five to ten eggs from each
female were placed on a clean microscopic slide and the
number of ridges on floats was counted under a light
microscope (x4, Olympus). Adult emerging from identified isofemale progenies were used to examine the ornamentation of wing and palpi. Adult F1 progenies of
identified sibling species A, B, C and D were coded and
preserved in microcentrifuge tubes containing silica gel

plugged with a small piece of cotton wool for molecular
studies. Similarly adults that emerged from collected larvae were also preserved separately for molecular
characterization.

adults that emerged from collected larvae were tentatively identified as species B, based on morphological
characteristics of larvae and adults.
Phylogenetic analysis based on D3 rRNA

PCR amplification, DNA sequencing and phylogenetic
analysis

The DNA of individual mosquitoes was isolated following
the method described by Livak [26]. The ITS-2 region of
the rDNA was amplified using primers ITS-2A (5’ - TGT
GAA CTG CAG GAC ACA T- 3’) and ITS-2B (5’- TAT
GCT TAA ATT CAG GGG GT - 3’) [27]. The D3 domain
of 28 S rDNA was amplified using D3A (5’-GAC CCG
TCT TGA AAC ACG GA-3’) and D3B (5’- TCG GAA
GGA ACC AGT TAC TA - 3’) primers [28]. For each
PCR assay, 50 μl PCR reaction mixture was used. Each
mixture contained 0.50 μM of each primer, 200 μM of
each dNTP, 1.5 mM of MgCl2 and 1.25 unit of taq polymerase (AmpliTaq Gold, Applied Biosystem). The PCR
conditions for both PCRs were an initial denaturation at
95°C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C
for 30 s, and 72°C for 45 s followed by a final extension at
72°C for 7 min. The PCR products that were successfully
amplified were then purified using the Quiaquik PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, California, USA) to remove unincorporated primers and dNTPs prior to sequencing. The
purified PCR amplicons were sent to M/s Macrogen Inc.,
South Korea, for sequencing in both the forward and
reverse directions.
The derived sequences obtained were then analysed
together with other representative sequences obtained
from GenBank using ClustalW. Neighbour-Joining phylogeny tree was constructed with Bootstrap values from 500
replicates using the MEGA software [29]. Details of the
collection sites of different Sri Lankan An. subpictus specimens from the present study and that of An. vagus and
other members of the Subpictus and Sundaicus complexes
obtained from GenBank and used for phylogenetic analysis
of DNA sequences are also summarized in Table 1.

Results
Identification of An. subpictus sibling species and
morphological variations in sibling species B

A total of 246 blood-fed An. subpictus s.l. were collected
from the four field sites in this study and based on
number of ridges on the laid eggs, 2, 152, 11 and 6
females were tentatively characterized as belonging to
species A, B, C and D respectively. Different combinations of variant patterns in wing ornamentation (variation in the costal pre-humeral dark spot and pre-apical
dark spot) and palpal ornamentation (relative lengths of
the apical pale and sub-apical dark bands) in those mosquitoes identified as An. subpictus species B were
observed. In the larval collection from Kallady, all 54

Construction of a phylogenetic tree based on D3 rDNA
sequences (Additional file 1) resulted in three stable
clades (bootstrap values ≥ 95%). The D3 rDNA phylogenetic tree analysis is presented in Additional file 2. One
clade consisted of 14 mosquitoes identified as An. subpictus species A, C, or D and seven identified as species
B collected in the present study (LK-B1, 4, 8, 12, 27, 29
and 30) and is termed the An. subpictus clade. All members in this clade possessed identical D3 sequences.
A second clade, termed the An. sundaicus clade, contained 22 mosquitoes identified as An. subpictus species
B (LK- B2, 3, 5, 7, 9-11, 13-26, 28) based on the same
morphological characteristics as the species B members
falling into the An. subpictus clade. The D3 rDNA
sequences of all members identified as An. subpictus
species B in the An. sundaicus clade (Additional file 2)
were identical to those of An. sundaicus cytotype D
samples (AY691512, AY691513 and AY691516) collected from the Andaman and Nicobar islands in an
unrelated study [30]. The differences between the An.
subpictus and An. sundaicus clades were caused by six
single nucleotide and two trinucleotide changes and one
insertion/deletion within the analysed sequences.
An An. vagus voucher specimen from China
(FJ457630.1) formed a third clade that was more closely
related to the An. subpictus clade than to the An. sundaicus clade (Additional file 2).
Phylogenetic analysis based on ITS-2 rRNA

Sequence analysis of the ITS-2 sequences of the presumed
An. subpictus species B collected in the Eastern province
in this study and other available GenBank sequences for
An. subpictus s.l. and An. sundaicus s.l. (Additional file 3)
were also carried out. The results showed that all species
B-type specimens from this study (LK-B series) that
formed the An. sundaicus clade with members of Sundaicus complex based on their D3 sequence (LK-B7, 9-11, 16,
and 22-24) also stably clustered with An. sundaicus s. l.
(AF 369562 and AF 662258) and An. epiroticus based on
ITS-2 sequences (Figure 2). This clade is termed the
An. sundaicus clade. The only two additional An subpictus
B-like specimens in this study whose ITS-2 sequences
were determined (LK-B6 and 31) were also found to fall
into this An. sundaicus clade. Several specimens identified
as An. subpictus s.l. from many other locations in Southeast Asia also grouped with the An. sundaicus clade on
analysis of the ITS-2 sequences. These included one specimen (AF406615.1) isolated from an unspecified inland site
in Sri Lanka and two others collected from unspecified

coastal areas of Sri Lanka (AY049004.1 and AF406616.2).
The An. sundaicus clade also included specimens classified
as An. subpictus s.l. from Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia,
Indonesia and Thailand. The ITS-2 sequences were identical in all of the An. subpictus species B specimens collected in this study, the LK-B series, from different sites in
Eastern Sri Lanka (Additional file 3). These were also identical to the ITS-2 sequence in An. subpictus s.l. from
Myanmar (GQ870334.1), differed from An. subpictus s.l
(AF406615.1) in the absence of a single insertion present
in the latter, and differed from the two other independent
An. subpictus s.l. isolates from Sri Lanka (AY049004.1 and
AF406616.2) in three nucleotide changes that were common to the latter (Additional file 3).
A second ITS-2 clade in this analysis, termed the
An. subpictus clade, was composed of inland populations
of An. subpictus s.l. from Punjab, India and Sri Lanka
isolated by independent researchers and whose sibling
status had not been determined. These could conceivably have all belonged to species A, C or D of Subpictus
complex. The ITS-2 sequences from specimens identified as An. subpictus species A, C or D that formed the
An. subpictus complex on analysis of the D3 sequences
were not available. However ITS-2 sequences from
two different specimens (LK-A21 and LK-A22) identified as An. subpictus species A in the present collection
were identical to those from two An. subpictus s.l. specimens collected from Southern Sri Lanka by others
(GQ870337.1 and GQ870336.1) and that clearly fell into
the An. subpictus ITS-2 clade on phylogenetic analysis
(Figure 2 and Additional file 3).
Two of the available ITS-2 sequences from An. vagus
(FJ457631.1, a voucher specimen from Hainan island in
China and FJ654649 from Indonesia) formed a separate
clade that was more closely related to the An. subpictus
clade than the An. sundaicus clade.
While the three major clades were firmly established
with bootstrap values ≥ 99%, some of the internal
branches within the An. subpictus and An. sundaicus
clades had bootstrap values < 70% indicating a lower
degree of robustness in the proposed separation (Figure 2).

Discussion
The Subpictus complex, the Sundaicus complex, An.
vagus and the recently described An. pseudosundaicus
[31] are closely related taxons. They have been reported
to differ in the ornamentation of wings and palpi, properties that are commonly used in identification keys of
Anopheline mosquitoes [31]. However only the taxons
An. subpictus and An. sundaicus are known to exist as
species complexes. Morphological characters that are
commonly used to distinguish the four taxons are summarized in Additional file 4. A prominent morphological
character that differentiates adult An. sundaicus s.l. from

Page 7 of 9

An. subpictus s.l. and An. vagus is reported to be the
speckling of the femur and tibia of the legs of An. sundaicus s.l. [6,31]. Specimens identified as An. subpictus
species B in the present study did not show prominent
speckling in their femur and tibia. There is an overlap
in the reported number of egg ridges that distinguish
An. subpictus species B and An. sundaicus s.l. [6]. In An.
subpictus species B the number of egg ridges vary from
16-20 while it is reported to be about 20 for An. sundaicus s.l. [6]. All four cytotypes (A - D) of the Sundaicus
complex can be differentiated by examining the distribution of heterochromatin blocks [32,33]. On the other
hand, X- chromosomal inversion polymorphism and egg
morphology are generally used to discriminate members
of the Subpictus complex [5]. The existence of adult
(length variation of apical pale band and subapical dark
band of female palpi), larval (characteristic of seta 4 M)
and pupal (setae of 6, 7, 9-I) morphological variations
among members of the Subictus complex have been
reported (Additional file 4) [7,34].
Importantly, genetic analysis of specimens morphologically identified as An. subpictus B in this study showed
that a majority are probably members of the Sundaicus
complex distinct from species A, C and D of the An. subpictus complex as well as An. vagus. This group of An.
sundaicus s.l. - like mosquitoes were probably incorrectly
identified as An. subpictus B based on morphological characteristics. A minority of specimens identified as An. subpictus species B in the present study based on the number
of ridges in egg floats or ornamentation, and which were
genetically related based on D3 sequences to species A, C
and D, may actually be species A, C or D of the Subpictus
complex. This is because the reported differences between
Indian species B and D on the number of egg ridges and
between Indian species B, C and D in adult ornamentation
are small [7]. The morphological differences between An.
subpictus species A - D reported to exist in India may also
not be altogether applicable to Sri Lankan An. subpictus
species due to morphological changes consequent to isolation in an island. There is an alternative possibility that
the specimens that were morphologically like the Indian
An. subpictus species B but with D3 sequences related to
species A, C and D might belong to the archetypical An.
subpictus species B category originally identified in India
through differential X-chromosome morphology [5,7].
Further chromosomal, molecular and morphological studies are needed to clarify these possibilities.
The genetic data is consistent with a panmictic population of An. sundaicus sibling species being present in the
Eastern province of Sri Lanka. The identity of the ITS-2
sequence of this species with that from a specimen identified as An. subpictus s.l. from Myanmar suggests that
the latter may belong to the same species. This is consistent with the relative coastal proximity and historically

close maritime contacts between Eastern Sri Lanka and
Myanmar. One other hand, An. subpictus s.l specimen
collected previously from elsewhere in Sri Lanka differed
from the An. sundaicus LK-B series sequence in a single
insertion while two other specimens showed three
nucleotide changes. Hence it is possible that there is
some reproductive isolation among An. sundaicus s.l.
species in Sri Lanka that has led to differences in the
ITS-2 sequences. In this context it will be important to
examine the D3 and ITS-2 sequences of mosquitoes previously identified as An. subpictus species B in the Puttalam district in the West coast of Sri Lanka where they are
reported to be the major vector of coastal malaria [8].
The present findings also suggest that the two genotypes,
An. subpictus s.l. and An. sundaicus s.l. may occur sympatrically in habitats close to the coast.
There is also the indication from available ITS-2 data
that members of the Sundaicus complex may have
been mistakenly identified as An. subpictus s.l. in other
parts of Southeast Asia. Compatible conclusions were
reached with a cryptic species tentatively termed An.
vagus genotype B in Timor Leste based on morphological characterization [35]. The An. vagus genotype B,
was morphologically similar in the absence of speckling in its femur and tibia to An. vagus and An. subpictus s.l. than to An. sundaicus s.l. However it is
clustered with An. sundaicus s.l. as well as some specimens identified morphologically as An. subpictus s.l.
populations of Sri Lanka on phylogenetic analysis of its
ITS-2 sequence [35]. Indeed it is possible that most, if
not all, of the reported An. subpictus species B likemosquitoes in Sri Lanka, and perhaps elsewhere in
Southeast Asia, are in fact members of the An. sundaicus complex. Detailed studies of chromosome inversions and molecular genotyping of Asian An. subpictus
species B-like mosquitoes is needed to establish
whether this is indeed the case.
Morphological characterization of mosquitoes provides a simple, inexpensive and readily applicable way
of identifying many malaria vectors in the field. However, there are clearly limitations with using morphological characteristics alone to differentiate anopheline
mosquitoes where they exist sympatically as species
complexes or as closely related species. In the context
of malaria transmission, further molecular characterization utilizing additional mitochondrial genes such as
cytochrome oxidase subunits (CO) and cytochrome B
(Cyt-b) are additionally needed to characterize the presence of sibling species in Subpictus complex and Sundaicus complex in Asia. This will aid the development
of more robust morphology-based or DNA-based identification methods that would be suitable for fieldbased applications.

Conclusions
Sequence analysis of ITS-2 and 28 S RNA D3 domains of
rDNA show that a majority of specimens morphologically
identified as An. subpictus species B in Eastern Sri Lanka
are in fact members of the Sundaicus complex. The existing
morphological variations and their use for identifying closely related anopheline mosquitoes, especially when they
exist as species complexes, are imprecise and need to be
replaced with DNA sequence-based techniques. The results
also suggest that molecular techniques for classifying the
relationships between members of the Sundaicus and Subpictus complexes are particularly important in South and
Southeast Asia where members of the Sundaicus complex
may have a hitherto unappreciated geographical spread
helped possibly by long-existing maritime links between the
nations of the region. Members of the Sundaicus complex,
that are well known malaria vectors in coastal areas, pose
the risk of increasing malaria transmission with a rise in sea
levels due to global warming and expanding aquaculture.
These findings have a direct bearing on the continued
development of effective malaria vector control or elimination programmes in Sri Lanka and elsewhere in Asia.
