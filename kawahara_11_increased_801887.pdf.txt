Abstract
Background: Researchers conducting molecular phylogenetic studies are frequently faced with the decision of
what to do when weak branch support is obtained for key nodes of importance. As one solution, the researcher
may choose to sequence additional orthologous genes of appropriate evolutionary rate for the taxa in the study.
However, generating large, complete data matrices can become increasingly difficult as the number of characters
increases. A few empirical studies have shown that augmenting genes even for a subset of taxa can improve
branch support. However, because each study differs in the number of characters and taxa, there is still a need for
additional studies that examine whether incomplete sampling designs are likely to aid at increasing deep node
resolution. We target Gracillariidae, a Cretaceous-age (~100 Ma) group of leaf-mining moths to test whether the
strategy of adding genes for a subset of taxa can improve branch support for deep nodes. We initially sequenced
ten genes (8,418 bp) for 57 taxa that represent the major lineages of Gracillariidae plus outgroups. After finding
that many deep divergences remained weakly supported, we sequenced eleven additional genes (6,375 bp) for a
27-taxon subset. We then compared results from different data sets to assess whether one sampling design can be
favored over another. The concatenated data set comprising all genes and all taxa and three other data sets of
different taxon and gene sub-sampling design were analyzed with maximum likelihood. Each data set was subject
to five different models and partitioning schemes of non-synonymous and synonymous changes. Statistical
significance of non-monophyly was examined with the Approximately Unbiased (AU) test.
Results: Partial augmentation of genes led to high support for deep divergences, especially when nonsynonymous changes were analyzed alone. Increasing the number of taxa without an increase in number of
characters led to lower bootstrap support; increasing the number of characters without increasing the number of
taxa generally increased bootstrap support. More than three-quarters of nodes were supported with bootstrap
values greater than 80% when all taxa and genes were combined. Gracillariidae, Lithocolletinae + Leucanthiza, and
Acrocercops and Parectopa groups were strongly supported in nearly every analysis. Gracillaria group was well
supported in some analyses, but less so in others. We find strong evidence for the exclusion of Douglasiidae from
Gracillarioidea sensu Davis and Robinson (1998). Our results strongly support the monophyly of a G.B.R.Y. clade, a
group comprised of Gracillariidae + Bucculatricidae + Roeslerstammiidae + Yponomeutidae, when analyzed with
non-synonymous changes only, but this group was frequently split when synonymous and non-synonymous
substitutions were analyzed together.
Conclusions: 1) Partially or fully augmenting a data set with more characters increased bootstrap support for
particular deep nodes, and this increase was dramatic when non-synonymous changes were analyzed alone. Thus,
the addition of sites that have low levels of saturation and compositional heterogeneity can greatly improve
results. 2) Gracillarioidea, as defined by Davis and Robinson (1998), clearly do not include Douglasiidae, and

changes to current classification will be required. 3) Gracillariidae were monophyletic in all analyses conducted, and
nearly all species can be placed into one of six strongly supported clades though relationships among these
remain unclear. 4) The difficulty in determining the phylogenetic placement of Bucculatricidae is probably
attributable to compositional heterogeneity at the third codon position. From our tests for compositional
heterogeneity and strong bootstrap values obtained when synonymous changes are excluded, we tentatively
conclude that Bucculatricidae is closely related to Gracillariidae + Roeslerstammiidae + Yponomeutidae.

Background
Researchers conducting molecular phylogenetic studies are
frequently faced with the decision of what to do when
weak branch support is obtained for key nodes of importance. As one solution, the researcher may choose to
sequence additional orthologous genes of appropriate evolutionary rate. Indeed, it is well known that increasing the
number of characters can improve branch support (e.g.
[1-5]). However, generating large, complete data matrices
can become increasingly difficult as the number of characters increases. Two empirical studies [6,7] have concluded
that augmenting genes even for a subset of taxa can
improve branch support. However, because each study differs in the number of characters and taxa, there is still a
need for additional studies that examine whether incomplete sampling designs are likely to aid at increasing deep
node resolution.
In this paper, we target Gracillariidae, a Cretaceous-age
(~100 Ma) group of leaf-mining moths [8] to test
whether the strategy of adding genes for a subset of taxa
can improve branch support for deep nodes. Gracillariidae, with 1,855 species [9,10], is one of the largest groups
of leaf-mining Lepidoptera with numerous economically
important species that cause agricultural damage
[9,11-16]. Gracillariids show a diversity of life-history
strategies, such as fruit mining, stem mining, leaf rolling,
boring, and galling [11,17], and some species change strategies during development [17-20]. Despite the agricultural importance and diversity of life-history strategies,
the systematics of Gracillariidae is poorly understood.
Monophyly of the superfamily Gracillarioidea as currently defined by Davis and Robinson [11] remains
uncertain. The phylogenetic position of Gracillarioidea in
Lepidoptera is also relatively unclear, though recent
molecular studies strongly support a close relationship to
Yponomeutoidea [7,21,22].
Davis and Robinson’s classification includes four
families in Gracillarioidea, Bucculatricidae, Douglasiidae,
Gracillariidae, and Roeslerstammiidae. Bucculatricidae
and Douglasiidae were included in Gracillarioidea based
on nine morphological features that they share with Gracillariidae and Roeslerstammiidae, including two from
the larva, two from the pupa, and five from the adult
[11]. Others have included Bucculatricidae, Gracillariidae,
and Phyllocnistidae (the latter now in Gracillariidae

[9,10,23,24]), Bucculatricidae, Gracillariidae, and Lyonetiidae [25], or Bucculatricidae, Gracillariidae and Roeslerstammiidae [26]. While some putative relationships have
been postulated for higher-level relationships within
Gracillarioidea based on morphology (e.g. [24,27], the
trees presented in these studies were based on phenetic
similarity rather than discrete character analysis. The
only phylogenetic study that examined higher-level gracillariid relationships was a recent study aimed at resolving broader relationships of Lepidoptera that included
14 gracillarioid species [22]. The authors suggested that
Gracillarioidea might not include Bucculatricidae or
Douglasiidae. Most phylogenetic studies within Gracillarioidea have focused mainly at the genus level or below
(e.g. host races of Acrocercops transecta [28,29], Epicephala and relatives [30-32], and Phyllonorycter [33,34]).
This study utilizes 21 nuclear protein-coding genes to
evaluate the effect of augmenting sequence data for a subsample of taxa and to tackle the problem of the phylogeny
of Gracillariidae and their relatives. Fifty-seven taxa,
including exemplars representing the major lineages of
Gracillarioidea plus outgroups, were initially sequenced for
ten genes (8,418 bp). After discovering that many deep
divergences within the superfamily could not be recovered
with strong branch support, we sequenced 11 additional
genes (6,375 bp) for 27 taxa representing the major
lineages of Gracillarioidea (21 genes total, 14,793 bp). We
compared results from four data sets differing in gene and
taxon sampling design (Figure 1), to assess whether one
design can be favored over another. We also examined the
effect of excluding synonymous changes, which at deeper
levels in our taxon sample are subject both to saturation
and to divergence in base composition, possibly obscuring
phylogenetic signal.

Methods
Taxon sampling

The present study included 45 species of Gracillarioidea,
of which 39 were Gracillariidae (Additional file 1). Taxa
were chosen to represent the major lineages as defined by
the classification of Davis and Robinson [11]. Whenever
possible, we included the type species or genus. Twelve
outgroups were chosen based on the availability of
sequence data and their phylogenetic proximity to Gracillarioidea in two recent molecular phylogenetic studies of

ditrysian Lepidoptera [7,21]. While we mention Oecophyllembiinae in our discussion, we follow Davis and Robinson
[11] and Vári et al. [35] and do not formally recognize this
subfamily.
Gene sampling

Ten nuclear protein-coding genes, totalling an alignment
length of 8,418 bp, were initially chosen for this study
(Table 1). These genes were included because they had
some of the highest amplification success rates and had
proven useful for estimating a “backbone” phylogeny of
Lepidoptera (see http://www.leptree.net/) and are among
the 68 gene regions originally developed for deep-level
phylogenetics of Arthropoda [36]. We created two data
sets for ten genes, one with 27 taxa (data set A, Figure 1A)
and another with 57 taxa (data set C, Figure 1C). After discovering that ten genes did not adequately resolve phylogenetic relationships among subfamilies, we chose a
resource-efficient approach to tackle the problem of weak
branch support for deep nodes in the tree. We additionally
sequenced eleven genes for 27 taxa and combined this
additional sequence data with the original ten (data set B,
14,793 bp; Figure 1B). These additional eleven genes were
chosen based on amplification success and examining the
average rate of non-synonymous change from a previous
study [36]. Throughout the paper, we refer to the “ten
genes” and “eleven genes” as the original ten and additional eleven genes. Because our primary goal was to produce the best estimate for relationships of Gracillariidae
and relatives, we combined data sets A through C to create data set D (57 taxa × 21 genes, 14,793 bp; Figure 1D).

We assessed the differences in tree topology and branch
support among these data sets and tested the effect of
synonymous changes on each.
Specifically, data set A (27 taxa × 10 genes) was constructed to examine whether modest taxa and gene sampling can strongly resolve relationships of Gracillariidae
and relatives. Data set B (27 taxa × 21 genes) was constructed to examine whether nearly doubling the number of characters would boost branch support for deep
splits that were not well supported with ten genes. Data
set C (57 taxa × 10 genes) was built to assess the effects
of adding more taxa to data set A. Finally, data set D
(57 taxa × 21 genes) was constructed to examine how
trees generated from a data set that included all taxa
and genes (but also approximately a quarter of the characters without data) compared to those from the other
three data sets. The amount of missing data for each of
the four data sets (A through D) was 13.6%, 14.3%,
31.2%, and 43.6% respectively.
For all genes except elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1a
[37]) and histone 3 (H3 [38]), nucleic acid sequences were
generated from mRNAs amplified with RT-PCR following
laboratory protocols, primer sequences, and amplification
strategies of Regier et al. [39]. For EF-1a and H3, we followed methods outlined in Kawakita et al. [30], Kawakita
and Kato [40], Ogden and Whiting [38], and amplified
directly from genomic DNA. Each single-gene data set
was individually translated and aligned with the “Translation Align” option in Geneious 5.1 [41] after making sure
the data set began with the first codon position (nt1). The
alignment was visually inspected, and checked twice for
frame-shifts and the presence of termination codons. Difficult to align regions were assessed in GBlocks 0.91b [42]
and removed as they can cause problems in phylogeny
estimation [43,44]. Sequences were also assessed for contamination and sample-switching error, by generating
pairwise distance tables for nt12, nt3, and nt123 in PAUP*
4b10 [45] and ML bootstrap trees in GARLI 1.0 [46] for
each gene before all genes were concatenated. The 21 data
matrices were concatenated with Geneious [41] and the
entire edited sequence data set visually checked. GenBank
accession numbers are listed in Additional file 1.
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic analyses were conducted with maximum
likelihood (ML) as implemented in GARLI 1.0 [46] and
GARLI-PART 0.97 [47]. All settings were kept as default
except where indicated below. We used jModelTest [48]
to determine the best substitution model for each data set,
which in nearly all cases was the General-Time-Reversible
(GTR) model [49,50], with among-site rate heterogeneity
modeled according to a gamma (Γ) distribution [51] while
allowing for a proportion of invariable sites (I) [52]. Two
thousand ML and bootstrap tree searches were conducted

for analyses that applied a nucleotide substitution model.
We also ran codon model analyses [53] as implemented in
GARLI. Due to computational limitations at the time of
this study, each codon analysis was conducted with 100
ML tree searches and 100 bootstrap replicates. To expedite tree searches, we used Grid computing [54] through
The Lattice Project [55]. For consistency in the characterization of results, we will refer to bootstrap support (BP) of
70-79% as “moderate,” support ≥ 80% (but < 90%) as
“strong,” and ≥ 90% as “very strong.” We use the arbitrary
cutoff of 80% BP as a measure to compare the number of
nodes with strong support across individual genes.
Base compositional heterogeneity

Base compositional bias can cause unrelated lineages to
incorrectly group together (e.g. [56-60]). While models
for phylogenetic analysis assume compositional homogeneity, strong compositional bias is common at sites capable of undergoing synonymous substitution [21,36,61].
In order to examine the effect of compositional heterogeneity, we examined five different character partitions,
with and without synonymous change: (a) “nt123": all
nucleotides and all changes; (b) “codon": all nucleotides
and changes, but implementing a codon model, which
“down-weights” synonymous changes because of their

relatively rapid evolution; (c) “degen1” [62,63]: all
sequence sites with the potential to undergo synonymous changes fully degenerated, an extension of the
RY coding scheme of Phillips et al. [64]; (d) “partitioned": all nucleotides partitioned into mostly synonymously evolving and mostly non-synonymously evolving
sites, specifically, the partition, “noLRall1 + nt2” versus
“LRall1 + nt3” of Regier et al. [62]; and (e) amino acids.
As an alternative means to filter synonymous substitutions, in some cases we also analyzed the noLRall1 +
nt2 data set alone (see Discussion).
To further investigate the potential influence of compositional heterogeneity, we conducted chi-square tests of
among-taxon heterogeneity on data set B (27 taxa × 21
genes). We chose data set B because it includes the largest
number of characters (14,793 bp) with a relatively low percentage of missing data (14.3%) out of the four data sets.
Chi-square tests were conducted on a character set undergoing mostly synonymous change, nt3, and one undergoing mostly non-synonymous change, noLRall1 + nt2.
We conducted the test for various groups in Gracillariidae
and outgroups on both the entire character set, and after
eliminating invariable sites in the degen1 data set. To
gauge the possible effect of compositional heterogeneity
on phylogeny inference, we compared neighbor-joining

Kawahara et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:182
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/182

trees using two different distances: ML distances based on
the GTR model, which can be influenced by compositional
heterogeneity; and Euclidean distances calculated on the
proportions of the four nucleotide states treated as independent characters, which will reflect only compositional
heterogeneity. Compositional distances were generated
using a Perl script that was written with modification of
the MBE Toolbox [65] and calculated with PAUP* [45].
Testing alternative hypotheses

Morphology and larval mining patterns predict the monophyly of Gracillariidae + Bucculatricidae + Roeslerstammiidae [26], Gracillariinae + Lithocolletinae [24], and
Oecophyllembiinae + Phyllocnistinae [11,35,66], but some
of these proposed higher-level groups were not recovered.
To test whether these differences between morphological
(and behavioral) versus molecular inferences were “real,”
i.e. not attributable to sampling error in the molecular
data, we used the Approximately Unbiased (AU) test of
Shimodaira [67]. The AU test ranks trees and determines
if trees under a topological constraint describe the data
significantly worse than the best tree.
To compare the confidence between our results and
prior morphology-based hypotheses, we conducted separate analyses in which groups believed to be monophyletic
were constrained. ML trees were calculated with constraints enforced, and the ML tree from the constrained
and the unconstrained analyses compared with the AU
test. Each analysis applied the same number of ML runs
determined to be appropriate for that character partition
as described above. Site likelihoods were estimated with
PAUP* [45]. For each data set, we combined the site likelihoods generated from all ML constraint analyses together
into a single file with the unconstrained site likelihoods. In
CONSEL 0.1j [68], the AU test statistic of Shimodaira [67]
was used to determine the difference in fit to data of the
constrained and unconstrained trees.

Results
Gene versus taxon sampling

Sampling design had the greatest influence on the recovery and bootstrap support of deep nodes in Gracillariidae
and relatives, which was especially pronounced for the G.
B.R.Y. clade (Gracillariidae + Bucculatricidae + Roeslerstammiidae + Yponomeutidae). Bootstrap support for this
clade rose for all five analytical methods when the number
of sampled characters was nearly doubled (data set A [27
taxa × 10 genes] versus B [27 taxa × 21 genes]; Table 2).
Degen1 provided the strongest support for the G.B.R.Y.
clade, rising from 74% (data set A) to 90% (data set B). An
increase was also seen when we analyzed the complementary 11 gene, 27 taxa data set (data set B minus A), which
had 84% BP for the G.B.R.Y. clade (data not shown). Conversely, doubling the number of taxa in data set A, yielding

Page 5 of 14

data set C, lowered support from 74% to < 50% BP for
degen1 (data set A versus C; Table 2). Augmenting data
set C with sequence data for 11 genes for just over half the
number of taxa greatly improved branch support (all
five analyses resulted in > 50% BP; data set C versus D,
Table 2). There was little difference in bootstrap support
for the G.B.R.Y. clade between the two data sets with the
greatest amount of gene sampling (data set B versus D).
Bootstrap support for other deep, non-G.B.R.Y. clades
changed very little.
Gracillariinae was polyphyletic in all analyses conducted
(data sets A through D), and the position of Phyllocnistinae remains unclear, as it was ancestral to the Lithocolletinae + Leucanthiza in data set D, but was sister to the
Parectopa group in data sets A through C for degen1 and
amino acids. For nt123 and codon analyses, the Phyllocnistinae was sister to the Parectopa group (nt123, data sets
A, C), sister to Dendrorcyter + Marmara (nt123, data set
D; codon, data sets C, D), or Eumetriochroa (nt123, data
set C, codon, data sets A, B). Partitioned analyses (“noLRall1 + nt2” versus “LRall1 + nt3”) gave the same placement for the Phyllocnistinae as did nt123 in all four data
sets.
Agreement and conflict among individual genes

There were no strongly supported groups that conflicted
with each other across genes, and few nodes above the
subfamily level were moderately or strongly supported
by any one gene alone. Instances of strong bootstrap
support by only one gene were: 83% for Gracillariidae
(CAD), 96% for the Acrocercops group (CAD), and 82%
for Eumetriochroa + Phyllocnistinae (Period; Additional
file 2).
Base compositional heterogeneity

Results of the chi-square tests for compositional heterogeneity are shown in Table 3. Homogeneity was not
rejected for any group in the noLRall1 + nt2 character
set. In contrast, nt3 showed highly significant heterogeneity across all taxa and the five taxon subsets. As a
gauge of the possible misleading signal produced by compositional heterogeneity, we calculated neighbor-joining
trees on distances reflecting only composition for nt123
and nt3. In these trees, Bucculatricidae clustered with
five other gracillarioid and non-gracillarioid taxa that are
together separated by long internal branches from the
Tineidae and the remaining species in the tree (Additional file 3).
Relationships of Gracillariidae and Gracillarioidea

All analyses resulted in a polyphyletic Gracillarioidea
sensu Davis and Robinson [11]; specifically, Douglasiidae
was consistently separated from Bucculatricidae, Gracillariidae, and Roeslerstammiidae by two or more nodes.

Total number of characters

Monophyly of the superfamily was significantly rejected
at P ≤ 0.015 in six of eight AU tests (Table 4). In all
analyses, branch support for the monophyly of Gracillariidae was robust (≥ 97% BP, Table 2). In general, nt123,
codon and nt123 partitioned results were similar in
topology and branch support, while degen1 and amino
acids were similar to each other, but differed from the
other results in topology. For data set D (57 taxa × 21
genes), degen1 resulted in a monophyletic ‘G.B.R.Y.’
clade with strong bootstrap support (83%, Figure 2).
The G.B.R.Y. clade was never recovered in nt123, codon
and nt123 partitioned ML trees, but the bootstrap consensus from these analyses supported the G.B.R.Y. clade
with weak, but evident signal (up to 62% BP, Table 2).
The latter three methods resulted in Bucculatricidae
diverging before all taxa except the designated outgroup,
Tineidae (e.g. Additional files 4, 5, 6).
While there was some support for the G.B.R.Y. clade,
none of the analyses provided > 55% BP for any interfamily relationships within this clade. To assess the possible sister group of Gracillariidae, we examined whether
the ML trees consistently recovered Gracillariidae plus
any combination of Bucculatricidae, Roeslerstammiidae,
or Yponomeutidae. ML analyses recovered a ‘G.R.Y.’
clade eight times, a ‘G.Y.’ clade five times, and a ‘G.B.Y.’
clade two times (Table 2). No ‘G.B.’, ‘G.R.’, or ‘G.B.R.’
clades were found in any of the best ML trees.
Within Gracillariidae, there was strong support for 28
of the 36 total nodes (78%) with data set D, and nearly

every species was placed into one of six lineages that are
either monotypic or strongly supported in our sampling.
These lineages, labeled on Figure 2, include: 1) Lithocolletinae + Leucanthiza, 2) Phyllocnistinae (excluding
Eumetriochroa), and four clades within Gracillariinae: 3)
Acrocercops group, 4) Dendrorycter + Marmara; 5) Gracillaria group, and 6) Parectopa group. Kumata compared the morphology of these groups and recognized
that each has unique features absent in others (e.g.
[69-72], some noted in Figure 2).
Branch support within these six gracillariid clades was
strong. There was > 90% BP for eight of the eleven nodes
within Lithocolletinae + Leucanthiza, three of five nodes
within the Acrocercops group, five of six nodes in the
Parectopa group, and all nodes in the Gracillaria group.
Monophyly of the subfamily Gracillariinae Stainton 1854,
as previously defined, was not recovered, and statistically
rejected in all eight AU tests (P < 0.001, Table 4). Rejection of gracillariine monophyly was also evident even
when Leucanthiza was excluded from Gracillariinae in
the AU tests (see Gracillariinae minus Leucanthiza,
Table 4). Monophyly of Gracillariinae + Lithocolletinae,
as previously proposed by Kuznetzov and Stekol’nikov
[24] was rejected by nt123 and codon model analyses (P
< 0.05). Monophyly cannot be rejected for the sistergroup relationship of the Oecophyllembiinae (sensu
Kumata) + Phyllocnistinae, however, as P > 0.073 under
the AU test in all cases (Table 4). While we do not formally designate any new taxonomic names in this study,

we recognize these well-supported clades as the first step
toward a phylogenetic reclassification of Gracillariidae.

Discussion
Augmentation of sequence data and its effect on branch
support

Partial augmentation of gene sampling can improve estimates of deep relationships of Gracillariidae (comparison of data set C and D), as it increased support for the
G.B.R.Y. clade for all five character treatments, most
strikingly for degen1 (a BP increase from < 50% to
83%). While partial or full augmentation of gene sampling generally improved branch support for deep
nodes, other nodes at the superfamily level are not
robustly supported even with > 14 kb of sequence data
(Table 2). Short internal branches for deep divergences
and the difficulty of achieving strong support for some
nodes even with 21 genes may reflect a rapid radiation,
which likely characterizes many divergences among lepidopteran families [21,22,73] and other insect orders [74].
The amount of missing data in data set D, accounting
for roughly a quarter of the total matrix, does not
apparently induce phylogenetic artifacts of the kind postulated by Lemmon et al. [75]. For degen1, the problematic Bucculatricidae is left out of the G.B.R.Y. clade in
the ML tree from non-augmented data set C (Figure
3C), but partially augmented data set D pulls it into the

G.B.R.Y. clade. We favor the topology from the partially
augmented data set D over the non-augmented data set
C, as the close relationship of Bucculatricidae to Gracillariidae corroborates morphological [24,26] and molecular studies [22].
A comparison of data sets A and B reveals that
increasing the number of genes from 10 to 21 can
improve bootstrap support values, a result consistent
with other studies (e.g. [1-5]). In contrast, increasing the
number of taxa (comparison of data set A and C)
depressed branch support for higher groups (e.g. G.B.R.
Y. clade). Therefore, if the goal is to achieve strong
branch support for deep divergences, it may be favorable
to focus on sequencing many genes for fewer taxa.
However, sequencing many characters for few taxa can
lead to problems such as long-branch attraction [76,77]
and produce relationships that are misleading (e.g.
[78-81]). Thus, if the researcher is faced with limited
resources and seeks to improve support for deep divergences without introducing misleading artifacts, a solution may be to partially augment more characters for a
selected but broad taxonomic sample. In our study, a
deep divergence that was initially weak in support (the
G.B.R.Y. clade) now has stronger branch support and
the relationships are largely consistent with prior morphological hypotheses. While we have chosen a broad
taxonomic sample to augment additional characters,

future studies should examine how the choice of taxa
for augmentation can influence the support for the correct tree.
Synonymous changes and base compositional
heterogeneity

Overall, two non-synonymous characters sets, degen1 and
amino acids, provided the highest support for deep-level
relationships in Gracillarioidea. These analyses resulted in
a monophyletic G.B.R.Y. clade, for which support in some
cases was very robust. In contrast, nt123, the codon model
and nt123 partitioned analyses provided little or no support for deep relationships among gracillarioid families.
When synonymous sites are added, only weak signal (≤
62% BP) remains for the G.B.R.Y. clade. We speculate that
analyses that include synonymous changes, even when
that signal is down-weighted or modeled separately, do
not effectively correct for the strong compositional heterogeneity found at nt3, leaving that non-phylogenetic signal
to conflict with and obscure the true signal from nonsynonymous change.
Strong compositional heterogeneity can incorrectly
group unrelated taxa together [56,57], or equivalently,
widely separate a taxon with strongly divergent base
composition from its true relatives. Under the three character treatments, nt123, codon model, and nt123 partitioned, Bucculatrix (Bucculatricidae) was placed between
the Tineidae and the remaining taxa (Additional files 4,
5, 6), a position difficult to reconcile with morphology.
Compositional heterogeneity may account for the strikingly different placement of Bucculatricidae. Because
non-synonymous changes strongly support the monophyly of the G.B.R.Y. clade, synonymous changes, mostly
at nt3, must account for the less decisive placement of
Bucculatricidae in nearly all nt123 trees. These results
support our previous findings (e.g. [21]) that filtering
synonymous substitutions (and thereby compositional
heterogeneity) can result in more robust phylogenetic
inference at deep levels.
A comparison of the ML topology with the neighborjoining GTR ML distance and with Euclidean compositional distance trees for nt123 and nt3 suggests that the
uncertain placement of Bucculatricidae in the nt123
data set is largely due to nt3 (Additional file 3). In the
compositional distance trees, six taxa (Bucculatrix sp.,
Atteva punctella, Eumetriochroa hederae, Hemerophila
felis, Phyllocnistis citrella, and P. magnoliella) fall
between the Tineidae and the remaining taxa in a long
internal branch. In the nt123 ML tree, in contrast, all
taxa but Bucculatrix move to parts of the tree that are
generally well supported and expected based on morphology and existing classifications (e.g. [11,35,82],
Eumetriochroa with Phyllocnistis, and Atteva with
Eucalantica).

Results of the ML nt3 analysis are very different, providing further evidence that compositional heterogeneity
can affect trees based on nt3 alone. Despite providing
about 90% of the total character change, the nt3 character set alone yields > 50% BP for only 7 nodes as compared to the full data set (nt123; 15 supported nodes),
fewer even than the degen1 character set (13 supported
nodes). Some unexpected relationships are found, such
as Bucculatrix + Eumetriochroa, which break up wellsupported groups, in this case the monophyletic Gracillariidae (Additional file 3, F).
Phylogenetic relationships of Gracillariidae and
Gracillarioidea

Our results provide some of the first molecular evidence
on the composition of and relationships within Gracillariidae and Gracillarioidea sensu Davis and Robinson
[11]. Some previous hypotheses about those relationships were confirmed, and several novel ones proposed.
Because rate variation between synonymous and nonsynonymous sites was dramatic in the present study (see
Table 3), we focus our discussion on the degen1 analyses unless otherwise noted. The discussion focuses on
the degen1 tree from data set D (Figure 2) because it
includes the most number of taxa and characters.
Gracillarioidea sensu Davis and Robinson [11], i.e.
including Douglasiidae, was polyphyletic in all analyses,
and monophyly of the superfamily was rejected significantly in six of eight AU tests (Table 4). Recently, Mutanen et al. [22] came to a similar conclusion based on
fewer gracillarioid taxa and genes. In their analyses, Gracillarioidea were never monophyletic, and Douglasiidae
was consistently placed in Apoditrysia. Mutanen et al.
[22] also had difficulty in placing Bucculatricidae, which
was paraphyletic with respect to Tritymba (Plutellidae),
and Bucculatricidae + Tritymba was sister to Gracillariidae with weak (< 50%) ML bootstrap support. Based on
our study and Mutanen et al. [22], Gracillarioidea as
currently defined, will need to be reevaluated. Future
studies should also sequence the genes included in the
present study for Ogmograptis (Bucculatricidae), a genus
that could not be obtained.
To resolve a possible sister group of Gracillariidae
remains a challenging problem. Comparing ML trees
from all analyses, Gracillariidae was most often closely
related to Roeslerstammiidae + Yponomeutidae (the latter relationship which is congruent with morphology
[83,84]). The close relationship of Yponomeutidae to
Gracillarioidea (excluding Douglasiidae) is also consistent with other molecular studies [7,21,22]. These
reports suggest, at least tentatively, that the putative
morphological apomorphies proposed for Gracillarioidea
by Davis and Robinson [11] may be homoplasies. In
order to restore monophyly of the superfamily, we

Kawahara et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:182
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/182

would need to exclude Douglasiidae from Gracillarioidea
or include Yponomeutidae. However, more convincing
resolution of inter-family relationships is desirable
before any formal taxonomic changes are made.
Monophyly of Gracillariidae was strongly supported in
nearly all analyses, a relationship that is corroborated by at
least two morphological synapomorphies [26]. The grouping of Oecophyllembiinae (sensu Kumata) + Phyllocnistinae, which share unique serpentine mine morphology
[11,66] and a highly specialized spinning instar [17], was
supported weakly or not at all in our analyses. However,
this sister-group relationship could not be rejected by any
AU test, and this grouping was well supported by Period
(82% BP, Additional file 2). The sister-group relationship
of Gracillariinae to Lithocolletinae proposed by Kuznetzov
and Stekol’nikov [24] was rejected by four of eight AU
tests (Table 4). Our results strongly support the inclusion
of Leucanthiza in Lithocolletinae, suggesting that this
genus should be transferred from Gracillariinae, a conclusion that is also supported by larval morphology (Wagner
and Davis unpubl. data). Monophyly of Gracillariinae
(both with and without Leucanthiza) was rejected by the
AU test in more than half of the data sets, suggesting that
this subfamily needs to be revised. However, we did identify four genus-level groups with strong support within
Gracillariinae: Acrocercops, Gracillaria, Parectopa groups
and Dendrorycter + Marmara, all which were previously
postulated based on morphology and life-history comparisons [18,69-72].

Conclusions
Several main conclusions can be drawn from this study.
First, branch support was maximized when gene sampling was increased, especially when we analyzed only
the non-synonymous changes. Second, augmenting a
taxon-rich data set (data set C; 57 taxa × 10 genes) with
additional sequence data for approximately half the taxa
substantially increased deep node support in a resourceefficient manner, apparently without inducing phylogenetic artifacts due to large blocks of missing data. While
these two conclusions were drawn specifically from the
data sets in this study, they are congruent with the results
of Cho et al. [7]. Third, Gracillariidae were monophyletic
in all our analyses, and nearly all species can be placed
into one of six strongly supported clades, though relationships among them remain largely unclear. Fourth,
Gracillarioidea, as defined by Davis and Robinson [11],
clearly do not include Douglasiidae, and changes to the
classification will be required. Fifth, the difficulty in placing Bucculatricidae is probably attributable to base compositional heterogeneity at nt3. From our tests for
compositional heterogeneity and strong bootstrap values
obtained when synonymous changes are excluded, we
tentatively conclude that Bucculatricidae is closely related

Page 11 of 14

to Gracillariidae + Roeslerstammiidae + Yponomeutidae.
Finally, the different levels of branch support seen under
our different character treatments reinforce the importance of assessing confidence in groups under multiple
phylogenetic approaches. Factors such as compositional
heterogeneity, which can influence phylogenetic accuracy, are most easily assessed when data are partitioned
into largely non-synonymous and mostly synonymous
character sets. Branch support overall is strongest when
all changes are included, but for several deep divergences,
strong support is obtained only when synonymous
changes were excluded. Because branch support for
many deep splits was weak, we are exploring whether
greater branch support for gracillariids and relatives can
be achieved by means of genomic (next-generation)
sequencing – the focus of a future project.
