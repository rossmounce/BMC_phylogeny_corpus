Abstract
Background: The magnoliids with four orders, 19 families, and 8,500 species represent one of the largest clades of early
diverging angiosperms. Although several recent angiosperm phylogenetic analyses supported the monophyly of magnoliids and
suggested relationships among the orders, the limited number of genes examined resulted in only weak support, and these issues
remain controversial. Furthermore, considerable incongruence resulted in phylogenetic reconstructions supporting three
different sets of relationships among magnoliids and the two large angiosperm clades, monocots and eudicots. We sequenced
the plastid genomes of three magnoliids, Drimys (Canellales), Liriodendron (Magnoliales), and Piper (Piperales), and used these data
in combination with 32 other angiosperm plastid genomes to assess phylogenetic relationships among magnoliids and to examine
patterns of variation of GC content.
Results: The Drimys, Liriodendron, and Piper plastid genomes are very similar in size at 160,604, 159,886 bp, and 160,624 bp,
respectively. Gene content and order are nearly identical to many other unrearranged angiosperm plastid genomes, including
Calycanthus, the other published magnoliid genome. Overall GC content ranges from 34–39%, and coding regions have a
substantially higher GC content than non-coding regions. Among protein-coding genes, GC content varies by codon position
with 1st codon > 2nd codon > 3rd codon, and it varies by functional group with photosynthetic genes having the highest
percentage and NADH genes the lowest. Phylogenetic analyses using parsimony and likelihood methods and sequences of 61
protein-coding genes provided strong support for the monophyly of magnoliids and two strongly supported groups were
identified, the Canellales/Piperales and the Laurales/Magnoliales. Strong support is reported for monocots and eudicots as sister
clades with magnoliids diverging before the monocot-eudicot split. The trees also provided moderate or strong support for the
position of Amborella as sister to a clade including all other angiosperms.
Conclusion: Evolutionary comparisons of three new magnoliid plastid genome sequences, combined with other published
angiosperm genomes, confirm that GC content is unevenly distributed across the genome by location, codon position, and
functional group. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses provide the strongest support so far for the hypothesis that the magnoliids
are sister to a large clade that includes both monocots and eudicots.

Background
Phylogenetic relationships among basal angiosperms
have been debated for over 100 years since Darwin [1]
identified the origin and rapid diversification of flowering
plants as an "abominable mystery". The difficulty of
resolving these relationships is likely due to the rapid radiation of angiosperms. During the past decade there has
been considerable interest in estimating phylogenetic
relationships based on single or multiple genes to resolve
the basal radiation of flowering plants [2-19]. Recently,
completely sequenced plastid genomes have been used to
estimate relationships among basal angiosperms [911,18,19] and comprehensive analyses of these data concur with earlier studies resolving either Amborella or
Amborella plus the Nymphaelales as the basal-most clade,
sister to all other angiosperms [2-8], [12-20]. Although
the whole plastid genome approach has enhanced our
understanding of basal angiosperm relationships, issues
of taxon sampling and methods of phylogenetic analysis
have generated considerable controversy regarding the
efficacy of this approach [13,18-23]. One of the major
limitations of this approach is the paucity of plastid
genome sequences from early diverging lineages, especially the magnoliids, which are currently represented
only by Calycanthus [24].
With four orders, 19 families, and approximately 8,500
species, the magnoliids comprise the largest clade of early
diverging angiosperms [25]. Recent single and multigene
trees have provided only weak to moderate support for the
monophyly of this clade [7,14,15,26-28]. One notable
exception is the phylogenetic estimate of Qiu et al. [17]
based on eight plastid, mitochondrial, and nuclear genes
and 162 taxa representing all of the major lineages of
gymnosperms and angiosperms. This eight-gene tree provides the first strong support for the monophyly of the
four orders of magnoliids, and for sister group relationships between the Canellales/Piperales and Laurales/Magnoliales.
One of the most important remaining phylogenetic issues
regarding angiosperms is the relationship of magnoliids
to the other major clades, including the monocots and
eudicots. All three possible relationships among these
major angiosperm clades have been generated based on
single and multiple gene trees, but none receives strong
support in any of these studies [reviewed in [25]]. The
three-gene phylogenetic tree of Soltis et al. [27] placed the
magnoliids and monocots in a clade that was sister to the
eudicots. Support for the monophyly of this group, which
was referred to as eumagnoliids, was weak with a jackknife
value of only 56%. This same topology was generated in
Bayesian analyses using the plastid gene matK, with a parsimony bootstrap value of 78% and a Bayesian posterior
probability of 0.73 [29]. Two multi-gene molecular phyl-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/77

ogenetic studies identified the magnoliids sister to the
eudicots. The 11-gene MP trees in Zanis et al. [7] provided
only weak support (56% bootstrap value) for the sister
group relationship between magnoliids and eudicots, and
in the 9-gene analyses of Qiu et al. [16] support for this
same relationship increased to 78% in ML trees. Finally, a
third possible resolution of relationships among magnoliids, monocots, and eudicots was recovered in two other
studies based on phytochrome genes [3] and 17 plastid
genes [6]. These studies suggested that magnoliids were
sister to a clade that included monocots and eudicots,
however, support for this relationship had only weak or
moderate bootstrap support (< 50% in Mathews and
Donoghue [3] and 76 or 83% in Graham and Olmstead
[6]). Thus, despite intensive efforts during the past 10
years relationships among magnoliids, monocots, and
eudicots remain problematic.
In this paper, we report on the complete sequences of
three magnoliid plastid genomes (Drimys, Liriodendron,
and Piper). We characterize the organization of two of
these genomes, including the most comprehensive comparisons of GC content among completely sequenced
plastid genomes. Furthermore, the results of phylogenetic
analyses of DNA sequences of 61 genes for 35 taxa, including 33 angiosperms and two gymnosperm outgroups provide new evidence for resolving relationships among
angiosperms with an emphasis on relative positions of
magnoliids, monocots and eudicots. These results have
implications for our understanding of floral evolution in
the angiosperms [e.g., [30]].

Results
Size, gene content, order and organization of the Drimys
and Piper plastid genomes
We have sequenced the plastid genomes of three genera of
magnoliids, Drimys, Liriodendron, and Piper. In this paper,
we only characterize the genome of two of these, Drimys
and Piper, and we use 61 protein-coding genes from all
three for the phylogenetic analyses. The genome sequence
for Liriodendron will be described in a future paper on the
utility of 454 sequencing [31] for plastid genomes (J. E.
Carlson et al. in progress).

The sizes of the Drimys and Piper plastid genomes are
nearly identical at 160,604 and 160,624 bp, respectively
(Figs. 1, 2), and within a kb of the Liriodendron plastid
genome size (159,886 bp; J. E. Carlson et al. in progress).
The genomes include a pair of inverted repeats of 26,649
bp (Drimys) and 27,039 bp (Piper), separated by a small
single copy region of 18,621 bp (Drimys) and 18,878 bp
(Piper) and a large single copy region 88,685 bp (Drimys)
and 87,668 bp (Piper). The Drimys IR has expanded on the
IRa side to duplicate trnH-gug. This expansion has not
increased the overall size of the IR in Drimys because two

of the genes in the IR of Drimys are shorter than they are
in Piper (ycf2 is 6909 and 6945 and ndhB is 1533 and 1686
in Drimys and Piper, respectively).
The Drimys and Piper plastid genomes contain 113 different genes, and 18 (Drimys) and 17 (Piper) of these are
duplicated in the IR, giving a total of 130–131 genes (Figs.
1, 2, Table 1). There are only two differences in gene content between these two magnoliid genomes; one is due to
the duplication of trnH-gug in Drimys and the second is
that ycf1 appears to be a pseudogene in Piper, since it has
an internal stop codon that results in a truncated gene that
is only 927 bp long (versus 5,574 bp in Drimys). Eighteen
genes contain introns, 15 of which contain one intron and
three (clpP, rps12, and ycf3) with two introns (Table 1).
There are 30 distinct tRNAs, and 8 and 7 of these are
duplicated in the IR of Drimys and Piper, respectively. The
genomes consist of 50.12% (Drimys) and 48.36% (Piper)
protein-coding genes, 7.38% (Drimys) and 7.34% (Piper)
RNA genes, and 42.5% (Drimys) and 44.3% (Piper) noncoding regions (intergenic spacers and introns). Gene
order is identical in the magnoliid plastid genomes
sequenced from Drimys, Piper, Liriodendron (J. E. Carlson
et al. in progress), and Calycanthus [24], and those of most
angiosperms, including tobacco.
GC content
The overall GC content of the Piper and Drimys plastid
genomes is similar, 38.31% and 38.79% respectively.
These values are within the range of 34–39% GC content
but slightly higher than that of the average for 35 plastid
genomes representing all currently available angiosperms
and one gymnosperm Pinus (Fig. 3A). In some cases, overall GC content correlates with phylogenetic position: early
diverging lineages (i.e., Amborella, Nymphaeales, magnoliids) tend to have a higher GC content and legumes and
non-grass monocots have lower values (Fig. 3A). GC content is not uniformly distributed across the plastid
genome (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). In general, GC content is
higher in coding regions than in non-coding regions (i.e.,
intergenic spacers and introns) (Fig. 4). This pattern is
also supported by the observation that GC content of protein-coding genes is higher than the overall GC content
for the complete genomes (compare Figs 3A,B). A t test

indicated that this pattern is statistically significant at p <
0.01. GC content also varies by codon position with the
1st codon > 2nd codon > 3rd codon (Figs. 5A,B, 6A). GC
content was also compared by partitioning protein-coding genes into three functional groups (Figs 3A, 5A,B, 6A).
This comparison demonstrates that the percent of GC for
all three codon positions is highest in photosynthesis
genes, followed by genetic system genes, and lowest in
NADH genes. Statistical tests using ANOVA demonstrated
that differences in GC content by codon positions and
functional groups are significant at p < 0.01. GC content
is similar among all genomes (Fig. 7) even in taxa that
have different gene orders (i.e., grasses and legumes). The
IR regions have higher GC content and the SSC has the
lowest. The much higher GC content in the IR is due to the
presence of rRNA genes (Fig. 6B). The lower GC content
in the SSC is due to the presence of eight of the 11 NADH
genes, which have a lower GC content than photosynthetic and genetic system genes (Figs. 5A,B, 6A). This
genome wide pattern of GC content is maintained even
when one copy of the IR is lost (bottom right panel in Fig.
7).
Phylogenetic analyses
Our phylogenetic data set included 61 protein-coding
genes for 35 taxa (Table 1), including 33 angiosperms and
two gymnosperm outgroups (Pinus and Ginkgo). The data
set comprised 45,879 nucleotide positions but when the
gaps were excluded there were 39,378 characters.

Maximum Parsimony (MP) analyses resulted in a single,
fully resolved tree with a length of 61,095, a consistency
index of 0.41 (excluding uninformative characters), and a
retention index of 0.57 (Fig. 8). Bootstrap analyses indicated that 22 of the 32 nodes were supported by values ≥
95% and 18 of these had a bootstrap value of 100%. Of
the remaining 10 nodes, five had bootstrap values
between 80–95%. Maximum likelihood (ML) analysis
resulted in a single tree with – lnL = 342478.92 (Fig. 9).
ML bootstrap values also were also high, with values of ≥
95% for 28 of the 32 nodes and 100% for 23 these nodes.
The ML and MP trees had similar topologies. Both trees
indicate that Amborella alone forms the earliest diverging
angiosperm, however, support for this placement is much

higher in the MP tree (100%) than the ML tree (63%). The
next most basal clade includes the Nymphaeales (Nuphar
and Nymphaea) and support for this relationship is 100%
in both MP and ML trees. Recent phylogenetic trees based
on complete plastid genome sequences [11,18,19] have
highlighted the difficulty of resolving the relative position
of Amborella and the Nymphaeales. Two alternative
hypotheses that have received the most support are:
Amborella as the earliest diverging lineage of angiosperms,
or Amborella and the Nymphaeales forming a clade sister
to all remaining extant angiosperms. In a previous study

using 61 plastid genes (see Fig. 4 in [18]) the first hypothesis was strongly supported (100%) in parsimony trees
and the second hypothesis received only moderate support (63%) in ML trees. Both MP and ML trees support the
basal position of Amborella alone in our expanded taxon
sampling. We performed a SH test [32] to determine if the
Amborella/Nymphaeales basal hypothesis is a reasonable
alternative to the ML and MP trees that support the
Amborella basal topology. The ML score for the alternative
topology was -ln L = 339758.53918 versus 339753.32204
for the best ML tree. The difference in the -ln L was

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:77

5.21714 with a p = 0.303. Thus, the Amborella/Nymphaeales basal hypothesis could not be rejected by the SH test,
indicating that identification of the most basal
angiosperm lineage remains unresolved even with the
addition of three magnoliid genomes.
Relationships among most other major angiosperm
clades are congruent in the MP and ML trees. Monophyly
of the magnoliids is strongly supported with 92 (MP) or
100% (ML) bootstrap values. Within magnoliids there are
two well-supported clades, one including the Canellales/
Piperales with 74 (MP) or 99 (ML)% bootstrap support,
and a second including the Laurales/Magnoliales with 82
(MP) or 99 (ML)% bootstrap support. The magnoliid
clade forms a sister group to a large clade that includes the
monocots and eudicots. Support for the sister relationship
of magnoliids to the remaining angiosperms is moderate
(72% in MP tree, Fig. 8) or strong (99% in ML tree, Fig. 9).
Support for the monophyly of monocots and eudicots is
strong with 100% bootstrap values, and relationships
among the monocots is identical in both analyses. The
Ranunculales occupy the earliest diverging lineage among
eudicots, and they are sister to two major, strongly supported clades, the rosids and Caryophyllales/asterids.
There is strong support for the sister group relationship
between the Caryophyllales and asterids (92% in MP and
100% in ML). Both MP and ML trees provide strong support for the placement of Vitis as the earliest diverging lineage within the rosids. The only remaining incongruence
between MP and ML trees is found within the rosids. In
both analyses, eurosids I are not monophyletic, although
support for relationships among the five representatives
of this clade to the eurosid II and Myrtales clades is not
strong.

Discussion
Genome organization and evolution of GC content
The organization of the Drimys and Piper genomes with
two copies of an IR separating the SSC and LSC regions is
identical to most sequenced angiosperm plastid genomes
[reviewed in [33]]. The sizes of the genome at 160,604
and 160,624 bp, respectively are similar to the each other
and Liriodendron, but larger than the only other sequenced
magnoliid genome (Calycanthus, 153,337, 23, Table 1).
Most of this size difference is due to the larger size of the
IR in Drimys (26,649 bp) and Piper (27,039 bp) relative to
Calycanthus (23,295 bp), although some is also due to the
larger LSC region (Table 1). Expansion and contraction of
the IR is a common phenomenon in land plant plastid
genomes [34] with the IR ranging in size from 9,589 bp in
the moss Physcomitrella [35] to 75,741 bp in the highly
rearranged angiosperm genome of Pelargonium [36,37].
Among angiosperms the IR generally ranges in size

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/77

between 20–27 kb, and the magnoliid genomes except for
Calycanthus are at the high end of that range.
Gene order of the magnoliid plastid genomes is identical
to tobacco and many other unrearranged angiosperm
plastid genomes. There are a few differences in gene content and these can be explained by two phenomena. The
first concerns differences in the annotation of two genes
in these genomes. Two putative genes (ACRS and ycf15) in
Calycanthus were not annotated in Drimys and Piper
because several recent studies indicated that they are not
functional plastid genes. The sequence of ycf15 has been
shown to be highly variable among angiosperms, with
conserved motifs at the 5' and 3' ends and an intervening
sequence that makes it a pseudogene [38,39]. An examination of ycf15 transcripts in spinach indicated that is not
a functional protein-coding gene [38]. More recent
sequence comparisons of ycf15 in other plastid genomes
also supported the conclusion that this putative gene is
not functional [9,39]. The ACRS gene was identified by
Goremykin et al. [24] in Calycanthus based on its very high
sequence identity with the mitochondrial ACR-toxin sensitivity (ACRS) gene of Citrus jambhiri [40]. This conserved
sequence has been identified (as ycf68) in a number of
plastid genomes, however, in cases where it has been critically examined the presence of internal stop codons indicates that this is a pseudogene. The second explanation for
gene content differences among the three magnoliid
genomes is caused by the expansion of the IR in Piper,
which results in the duplication of trnH. Small expansions
of the IR boundary are common in plastid genomes [34]
resulting in duplications of genes at the IR/SC boundaries.
The duplication of trnH in Piper is shared with Nuphar, a
member of the Nymphaeales (L. Raubeson et al. unpublished). This expansion of the IR to duplicate trnH has
clearly happened independently in Piper and Nuphar since
none of the other basal angiosperms or magnoliids have
this duplication.
Examination of GC content in 34 seed plant plastid
genomes reveals several clear patterns. GC content for the
complete genomes ranges between 34–39% (Fig. 3A),
confirming previous observations that plastid genomes
are in general AT rich [24,39,41-47]. The uneven distribution of GC content over the plastid genome is also very
evident, and there are several explanations for this pattern. First, there is a clear bias for the coding regions to
have a significantly higher GC content than non-coding
regions (Figs. 3, 4), which again confirms previous observations based on comparisons of many fewer genomes
[24]. Second, there is an uneven distribution of GC content by regions of the genome with the highest GC content
in the IR and the lowest in the SSC (Figs. 4, 7). The higher
GC content in the IR can be attributed to the presence of
the four rRNA genes in this region, which have the highest

Page 14 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:77

GC content of any coding regions (Fig. 6B). This higher
GC content in the IR region is maintained even when one
copy of the IR is lost as in Medicago and Pinus (Fig 7, bottom right panel). The lower GC content in the SSC region
is due to the presence of 8 of the 11 NADH genes, which
have the lowest GC content of any of the classes of genes
compared (Figs. 5, 6). Third, GC content varies by functional groups of genes. Among protein genes, GC content
is highest for photosynthetic genes, lowest for NADH
genes, with genetic system genes having intermediate values. This same pattern was observed by Shimada and Sugiura [41] in comparisons of the first three sequenced land
plant plastid genomes.
Differences in GC content were also observed by codon
position in protein-coding genes (Figs. 3B, 5A,B, 6A). For
each of the three classes of genes (photosynthetic, genetic
system, and NADH) the third position in the codon has a
significant AT bias. This pattern has been observed previously [41,45,46,48], and it has been attributed to codon
bias. Previous studies have demonstrated that there is a
strong A+T bias in the third codon position for plastid
genes [45,46,48]. This is in contrast to a GC bias in codon
usage for nuclear genes in plants [48]. Several studies have
examined codon usage of plastid genes to attempt to
determine if these biases can be attributed to nucleotide
compositional bias, selection for translational efficiency,
or a balance among mutational biases, natural selection,
and genetic drift [49-53]. All of these studies have been
limited to examining a single or few genes, and they have
been constrained by the limited sampling of complete
genome sequences for taking variation in GC content into
account. Our comparisons of GC content variation for a
wide diversity of angiosperm lineages provide a rich
source of information for future investigations of the relationship between GC content and codon usage bias.
Phylogenetic implications
The debate concerning the identity of the most basal
angiosperm lineage continues even though numerous
molecular phylogenetic studies of angiosperms have been
conducted over the past 15 years [3,4,6,8-11], [14-20],
[26-29], [54-66]. Several issues have confounded the resolution of relationships among basal angiosperms,
including long branch attraction associated with sparse
taxon density and poor taxon sampling, and conflict
among trees obtained using different phylogenetic methodologies [4,6,7,11,13,18-20,67]. Most recent studies
agree that Amborella and the Nymphaeales represent the
earliest diverging angiosperm lineages [3,4,6-8], [14-20],
[26-29], [57-66]. The most recent multi-gene phylogenetic reconstructions based on nine gene sequences from
the plastid, mitochondrial, and nuclear genomes [17]
generate trees supporting each of these two hypotheses
depending on the method of phylogenetic analysis and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/77

the genes included. Trees generated from plastid genes
supported the Amborella basal hypothesis, whereas mitochondrial genes supported the Amborella + Nymphaeales
hypothesis. Furthermore, MP analyses tended to support
the Amborella basal hypothesis and ML analyses supported
Amborella + Nymphaeales. A similar set of relationships
was also observed in recent phylogenetic studies using
sequences of 61 genes from completely sequenced plastid
genomes [18,19,67]. In these studies, MP trees placed
Amborella alone as the basal most angiosperm with strong
support and ML trees placed Amborella + Nymphaeales at
the base with moderate support. These differences were
attributed to rapid diversification and the lack of extant
lineages that could be used to cut the length of branches
leading to Amborella and the most recent common ancestor of lineages within the Nymphaeales.
Our phylogenetic analyses include three additional magnoliids from three different orders. Both MP and ML trees
(Figs. 8, 9) support Amborella alone as the earliest diverging lineage of angiosperms. Support for this relationship
is very strong in MP trees (100% bootstrap) and weak
(63%) in ML trees. However, a SH test that constrained
Amborella + Nymphaeales in a basal position indicated
that the two hypotheses of basal angiosperm relationships
are not significantly different. Thus, although both MP
and ML analyses including the three additional magnoliid
taxa support Amborella as the basal-most branch in the
angiosperm phylogeny, sampling of more taxa and genes,
and further investigations of model specification in phylogenetic analyses are needed before this issue is fully
resolved [see discussion in [18,23]].
Several earlier molecular phylogenetic studies based on
one or a few genes [27,56,63] did not support the monophyly of magnoliids. Furthermore, morphological studies
of angiosperms failed to detect any synapomorphies for
this group. The circumscription, monophyly, and relationships of magnoliids has only recently been established based on phylogenetic analyses of multiple genes
[14,15]. These earlier multigene trees provided only weak
to moderate support for the monophyly of magnoliids
and the sister group relationships of the Canellales/Piperales and Laurales/Magnoliales. A recent study using eight
plastid, mitochondrial, and nuclear genes [17] provided
the first strong support for both the monophyly and relationships among the four orders of magnoliids. Our phylogenetic trees based on 61 plastid protein-coding genes
also provide strong support for the monophyly of magnoliids and the sister relationship between the Canellales/
Piperales and Laurales/Magnoliales.
One of the most controversial remaining issues regarding
relationships among angiosperms concerns the resolution
of relationships among the magnoliids, monocots and

Page 15 of 20

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:77

eudicots. Previous phylogenetic studies have supported
three different hypotheses of relationships among these
lineages: (1) (magnoliids (monocots, eudicots)), (2)
(monocots (magnoliids, eudicots)), and (3) (eudicots
(magnoliids, monocots)). The first hypothesis was supported in phylogenetic analyses based on phytochrome
genes [3] and 17 plastid genes [6] but bootstrap support
for a sister relationship of monocots and eudicots was
only 67%. Several studies supported the second hypothesis [7,16,68], however, bootstrap support was again weak
ranging from 55 – 78%. The three-gene phylogenetic tree
of Soltis et al. [27] supported the third hypothesis with
only 56% jackknife support. This relationship was also
recovered in a matK gene tree with a parsimony bootstrap
value of 78% and a posterior probability of 0.73 [29].
Both MP and ML trees based on 61 plastid-encoded protein genes support hypothesis 1 (Figs. 8, 9). Branch support for this hypothesis is moderate (MP, Fig. 8) or strong
(ML, Fig. 9). Congruence of the results from both MP and
ML analyses is notable because our previous phylogenetic
analyses using whole plastid genomes that included only
one member of the magnoliid clade (Calycanthus, [18,67])
were incongruent. In these earlier studies, MP trees supported hypothesis 2 (monocots sister to a clade that
included magnoliids and eudicots), whereas ML trees supported hypothesis 1 (magnoliids sister to a clade that
included monocots and dicots). These differences provide
yet another example of the importance of expanded taxon
sampling in phylogenetic studies using sequences from
whole plastid genomes [18,67]. The addition of other
angiosperm lineages, especially members of the Chloranthales, Certatophyllaceae, and Illiciales may be critical for
providing additional resolution of relationships among
the major clades.

Conclusion
The genome sequences of three additional magnoliids
have a very similar size and organization to the ancestral
angiosperm plastid genome. Comparisons of 34 seed
plant plastid genomes confirm that GC content is unevenly distributed across the genome by location, codon
position, and functional group. Phylogenetic analyses for
61 protein-coding genes using both maximum parsimony
and maximum likelihood methods for 35 seed plants provide moderate or strong support for the placement of
Amborella sister to all other angiosperms. Furthermore,
there is strong support for the monophyly of magnoliids
and for the recognition of two major clades, the Canellales/Piperales and the Laurales/Magnoliales. Finally, phylogenetic analyses provide the strongest support so far that
magnoliids are sister to a large clade that includes both
monocots and eudicots.

Methods
Plastid isolation, amplification, and sequencing
10–20 g of fresh leaf material of Drimys granatenis and
Piper coenoclatum was used for the plastid isolation. Leaf
material was obtained from the University of Connecticut
Greenhouses (accession numbers 200100052 for Drimys
and 199600027 for Piper). Plastids were isolated from
fresh leaves using the sucrose-gradient method [69]. They
were then lysed and the entire plastid genome was amplified using Rolling Circular Amplification (RCA, using the
REPLI-g™ whole genome amplification kit, Molecular Staging) following the methods outlined in Jansen et al. [70].
The RCA product was then digested with the restriction
enzymes EcoRI and BstBI and the resulting fragments were
separated by agarose gel electrophoresis to determine the
quality of plastid DNA. The RCA product was sheared by
serial passage through a narrow aperture using a Hydroshear device (Gene Machines), and the resulting fragments
were enzymatically repaired to blunt ends and gel purified, then ligated into pUC18 plasmids. The clones were
introduced into E. coli by electroporation, plated onto
nutrient agar with antibiotic selection, and grown overnight. Colonies were randomly selected and robotically
processed through RCA of plasmid clones, sequencing
reactions using BigDye chemistry (Applied Biosystems),
reaction cleanup using solid-phase reversible immobilization, and sequencing using an ABI 3730 XL automated
DNA sequencer. Detailed protocols are available at [71].
Genome assembly and annotation
Drimys and Piper. Sequences from randomly chosen clones
were processed using PHRED and assembled based on
overlapping sequence into a draft genome sequence using
PHRAP [72]. Quality of the sequence and assembly was
verified using Consed [73]. In most regions of the
genomes we had 6–12-fold coverage but there were a few
areas with gaps or low depth of coverage. PCR and
sequencing at the University of Texas at Austin were used
to bridge gaps and fill in areas of low coverage in the
genome. Additional sequences were added until a completely contiguous consensus was created representing the
entire plastid genome with a minimum of 2X coverage
and a consensus quality score of Q40 or greater.

Liriodendron. The Liriodendron plastid genome sequence
was obtained using 454 sequencing technology [31]. This
work will be described more fully in a separate paper
focused in the utility of 454 technology for plastid
genome sequencing (J. E. Carlson et al. in progress).
Briefly, plastid genome containing clones were identified
from a genomic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
library that had been constructed for Liriodendron [74].
The entire plastid genome was sequenced from a pooled
sample of DNAs isolated from three overlapping largeinsert BAC clones. The BAC DNAs were processed for 454

sequencing according to protocols provided by 454 Life
Sciences (Branford, CT, also see [31]). One-half plate run
on the Genome Sequencer 20™ System (Life Sciences,
Branford, CT; Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN)
generated over 15,000 sequences with an average read
length of 103 bp. Reads including vector sequence were
removed and the remaining reads were assembled using
the 454-de novo assembly software. Each base in the
assembly was inferred based on an average of 90 independent reads.
Genome annotation
The coordinate of each genome was standardized for gene
annotation to be the first bp after IRa on the psbA side. The
genomes were annotated using the program DOGMA
(Dual Organellar GenoMe Annotator [75]). All genes,
rRNAs, and tRNAs were identified using the plastid/bacterial genetic code.
Examination of GC content
GC content was calculated for 34 seed plant plastid
genomes, including the gymnosperm Pinus and 33
angiosperms. GC content was also determined for 66 protein-coding genes. These genes were partitioned into three
functional groups (photosynthesis (33), genetic system
genes (22), and NADH (11) genes), and GC content was
calculated for the entire gene and the first, second, and
third codon positions. The genes included in each of these
three groups are: (1) photosynthetic genes (atpA, atpB,
atpE, atpF, atpH, atpI, psbZ, petA, petB, petD, petG, petL,
petN, psaA, psaB, psaC, psaI, psaJ, psbA, psbB, psbC, psbD,
psbE, psbF, psbH, psbI, psbJ, psbK, psbL, psbM, psbN, psbT,
rbcL); (2) genetic system genes (rpl14, rpl16, rpl2, rpl20,
rpl32, rpl33, rpl36, rpoA, rpoB, rpoC1, rpoC2, rps11, rps12,
rps14, rps15, rps18, rps19, rps2, rps3, rps4, rps7, rps8); and
(3) NADH genes (ndhA, ndhB, ndhC, ndhD, ndhE, ndhF,
ndhG, ndhH, ndhI, ndhJ, ndhK). GC content was also plotted over the entire genome for all 34 taxa, which were classified into 10 groups based on gene order and
phylogenetic placement (Figs. 8, 9).

Statistical analyses of GC content between rRNA genes
and complete genomes and between 72 protein-coding
genes and complete genomes were performed using a t
test. Analyses of GC content among the three codon positions and among the three functional classes were performed using one way ANOVA. All statistical analyses
used the program SPSS, version 9.0 [76].
Phylogenetic analysis
Alignment
The 61 protein-coding genes included in the analyses of
Goremykin et al. [9,10] and Leebens-Mack et al. [18] were
extracted from Drimys, Liriodendron and Piper using the
organellar genome annotation program DOGMA [75].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/77

The same set of 61 genes was extracted from plastid
genome sequences of 32 other sequenced genomes (see
Table 1 for complete list). All 61 protein-coding genes of
the 35 taxa were translated into amino acid sequences,
which were aligned using MUSCLE [77] followed by manual adjustments, and then nucleotide sequences of these
genes were aligned by constraining them to the aligned
amino acid sequences. A Nexus file with character sets for
phylogenetic analyses was generated after nucleotide
sequence alignment was completed. The complete nucleotide alignment is deposited online at [78].
Tree reconstruction
Phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony (MP)
and maximum likelihood (ML) were performed using
PAUP* version 4.0b10 [79] on a data including 35 taxa
(Table 1). Phylogenetic analyses excluded gap regions. All
MP searches included 100 random addition replicates and
TBR branch swapping with the Multrees option. Modeltest 3.7 [80] was used to determine the most appropriate
model of DNA sequence evolution for the combined 61gene dataset. Hierarchical likelihood ratio tests and the
Akaikle information criterion were used to assess which of
the 56 models best fit the data, which was determined to
be GTR + I + Γ by both criteria. For ML analyses we performed an initial parsimony search with 100 random
addition sequence replicates and TBR branch swapping,
which resulted in a single tree. Model parameters were
optimized onto the parsimony tree. We fixed these parameters and performed a ML analysis with three random
addition sequence replicates and TBR branch swapping.
The resulting ML tree was used to re-optimize model
parameters, which then were fixed for another ML search
with three random addition sequence replicates and TBR
branch swapping. This successive approximation procedure was repeated until the same tree topology and model
parameters were recovered in multiple, consecutive iterations. This tree was accepted as the final ML tree (Fig. 9).
Successive approximation has been shown to perform as
well as full-optimization analyses for a number of empirical and simulated datasets [81]. Non-parametric bootstrap analyses [82] were performed for MP analyses with
1000 replicates with TBR branch swapping, 1 random
addition replicate, and the Multrees option and for ML
analyses with 100 replicates with NNI branch swapping, 1
random addition replicate, and the Multrees option.
Test of alternate topology
A Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test [32] was performed to
determine if the alternative topology with Amborella +
Nymphaeales basal was significantly worse than the ML
tree that places Amborella alone as the basal angiosperm
lineage. A constraint topology with this alternative tree
topology was used and the SH test was conducted using
