Abstract
Background: Specialised leaf-eating is almost universally regarded as the ancestral state of all
ruminants, yet little evidence can be cited in support of this assumption, apart from the fact that all
early ruminants had low crowned cheek teeth. Instead, recent years have seen the emergence
evidence contradicting the conventional view that low tooth crowns always indicate leaf-eating and
high tooth crowns grass-eating.
Results: Here we report the results of two independent palaeodietary reconstructions for one of
the earliest deer, Procervulus ginsburgi from the Early Miocene of Spain, suggesting that despite
having lower tooth crowns than any living ruminant, this species included a significant proportion
of grass in its diet.
Conclusion: The phylogenetic distribution of feeding styles strongly supports that leaf-grass mixed
feeding was the original feeding style of deer, and that later dietary specialization on leaves or grass
occurred independently in several lineages. Evidence for other ruminant clades suggests that
facultative mixed feeding may in fact have been the primitive dietary state of the Ruminantia, which
would have been morphologically expressed only under specific environmental factors.

Background
The evolutionary strategies and feeding preferences in
extinct ruminants have figured importantly in evolutionary ecology [1-9], and although a more complex view of
the dietary adaptations and the evolutionary transitions of
the feeding styles have recently begun to emerge [4,5], little reliable dietary information exists for the taxa involved
in the Early Miocene ruminant radiation [10-14]. Because
increased molar crown height (hypsodonty) has long
been considered an evolutionary response to grass eating
(grazing), the presence of low-crowned molars (brachy-

donty) is often thought to imply a lack of grass in the diet,
and thus a leaf-eating (browsing) feeding style [3]. This
notion has led to browsing being widely recognized to be
the ancestral feeding state of ruminants and the starting
point of the evolutionary diversification towards mixed
feeders and grazers. Thus Early and Middle Miocene deer
have until now been universally considered as tropical
and subtropical forest dwelling browsers [11,15], despite
the fact that many modern cervids exhibit strategies typical of mixed feeders, and even of grazers [5], while being

significantly more brachydont than most other grass-eating ungulates.

shed light on the primitive dietary state of the Ruminantia
and also to reconstruct the habitat conditions and scenario for the first and broad adaptive radiation of deer in
which Procervulus was implied.

The oldest ruminants bearing antler-like appendages are
first recorded in the Early Miocene (MN3) of Europe.
Among them, Procervulus and Acteocemas have been considered related to true antlered deer, but the only teeth of
Procervulus are known, and so the investigated here. The
central fold on the protocone of upper molars, as well as
the dichotomous branching pattern and the furrowed surface of the protoantler of Procervulus, place it close to cervids, either as the sister-group [16] or the most basal
membership [17,18] of the family Cervidae. Some specimens might be assigned to the genus Procervulus at this
early time in the Spanish Neogene, and Procervulus ginsburgi [19]from the MN4 locality of Artesilla (CalatayudDaroca basin, Aragonian type-area) is the oldest species
represented by sufficient material to allow reconstruction
of its palaeodiet. P. ginsburgi is therefore a key to understanding the most likely initial hypsodonty, feeding
regime and habitat use in the first deer. Dicrocerus elegans
from Sansan (France), MN6 and approximately 3 Ma
younger than P. ginsburgi [20], is another early known
deer for which dietary adaptations have been also studied
[13].

Results
Table 1 depicts the results of hypsodonty and teeth wear
measurements on Artesilla sample.
Analysis of Molar Crown Height
The mean hypsodonty value calculated for P. ginsburgi of
0.99 (Fig. 1) falls within the category of brachydont.
Given such important presence of low-crowned molars, it
should be interpreted as a specialised leaf feeder, well
suited for live in closed wood habitats.

Extant ungulates with hypsodonty indices close to 1.0 are
Okapia johnstoni (1.18), classified as browser in closed
habitat, as well as Giraffa camelopardalis (1.2) and Odocoileus virginianus (1.23) mixed-habitat browsers [1].
Although molar crown height seems to be closely related
to dietary preferences, it is not always a reliable predictor
of diet in extant ungulates (Fig. 1). All grazing taxa are
classified as hypsodonts, and all the grazers sensu lato are
those with indices of a value greater than 3. Not all the
hypsodont species are grazers, however. The decidedly
hypsodont dentition of Antilocapra americana (4.61), a
desert, shrubsteppe and open grasslands dwelling browser
[30], has been attributed either to abrasion from grit
encroachment on food items [6] or to retention of hypsodonty from ancestors with more abrasive diets [9]. Since
the mesowear signal of A. americana shows the low relative abrasion of a browser [4], the latter interpretation
seems more tenable. The remaining extant browsers are
brachydont and mesodont species and there is no ungulate that includes grass in its diet with a lower value than
1.59. None of the extant mixed feeders have brachydont
teeth and all the species of this group with a tendency
towards grazing (VG) are hypsodonts.

Therefore, it is provided here a research for testing the
hypothesis which concerns the ancestral leaf-eating state
of the Cervidae. If this hypothesis is correct, it is to be
expected that P. ginsburgi, one of the oldest and most
brachydont known deer, reflects a dietary strategy equaling that of specialised browsers. To analyze the coevolutionary relationship between molar crown height and
feeding behaviour, we undertook a study of hypsodonty
[3,21,22] coupled with a combined analysis of microwear
[6,8,10,23,24] and mesowear [4,25-27] methodologies of
dietary assessment in fossil ungulates. Due to the complementary nature of these analyses and to the possibility of
establishing comparative studies between extant and fossil species, researchers have recently combined some of
these techniques to provide more solid inferences of dietary aspects and environment reconstructions for fossils
[9,28,29]. It is implied as a second objective to attempt to

Over evolutionary time scales, molar crown height is in
balance with the food-induced wear rate, which results in

based estimates however are significantly lower than the
mass-based estimate.
Those corresponding to the diets of grazing species, 2–4
years, are clearly far too short for a viable population, and
even the diet of the mixed feeder Gazella granti yields an
unrealistically low life span estimate of less than 5 years.
Only Rangifer tarandus, a mixed feeder close to the browsing end of the spectrum, yields an estimate that may be
considered compatible with a viable population, and only
so assuming a twinning rate of at least 1.2 (J. Damuth,
personal communication based on an unpublished
demographic model). Thus, the reindeer could be another
ruminant similar to P. ginsburgi for which grasses and
sedges represent the main part of its food composition
(>50%) before seasonal fluctuations and certain survival
situations [33].

Analysis of Microwear Features
P. ginsburgi (Fig. 2A) has enamel surfaces characterised by
intensive scratching (1153 scratches/mm2) and pitting
(864 pits/mm2). A clear difference is evident in microwear
patterning among the sample (Fig. 2A). The two observed
trends are confirmed by statistical analysis (Table 3), with
those specimens (23.1%, strict grazers) characterised
mainly by an intensive striated enamel surface and those
(15.4%, strict browsers) by an enamel surface comprised
largely of pitted.

the well-known relationship between diet and crown
height. Although wear rates cannot be calculated for P.
ginsburgi from the fossil material, it is possible to use wear
rates in extant ungulates [31] to bracket the palaeodietary
interpretations suggested for the species by tooth wear
analyses (Table 2). The mean height of five unworn lower
third molars of P. ginsburgi is 7.6 mm, and the estimated
body mass based on molar measurements [32] is 23.9 kg.
Using the regression equation from [31] for estimating
longevity from body mass, 0.751 (body mass)0.29, 23.9 kg
yields an expected life span of 14 years. It appears that P.
ginsburgi would manage comfortably on a diet similar to
that of Capreolus capreolus, which tooth-wear rate yields an
estimated dental life span of 23 years, much higher than
the mass-based estimate of about 14 years. All other wear-

Intensive scratching usually reflects a large consumption
of grasses and grass like plants, since this type of scar
results from the abrasion produced by the phytoliths
included on cellular walls. Leaves, seeds, and fruits of
many ligneous plants also possess phytolith contents, but
the frequency is low and unlikely to produce a heavily striated enamel surface [10,11]. Despite the fact that abrasion
can be also caused by other abrasive materials, as dust or
grit, several authors have identified that the incorporation
of these exogenous particles into the diet does not produce differences in the quantity of scratches [6]. Scratch
density obtained is much higher than the average for the
browsing ungulates (496.3 scratches/mm2) and is close to
that of grazing ungulates (1231.1 scratches/mm2). Kobus

Microwear discriminant analysis based on scratch and pit densities.

are typical grazers and display similar densities than P.
ginsburgi. Ovis canadensis is another good example of a
species inclined to grazing for which the 1235 scratches/
mm2 is explained by a 59% of grasses in its diet [34]. Ligneous food preferences are principally responsible for a
great abundance of pits [6]. The density recorded for P.
ginsburgi is much higher than the average for the grazing
ungulates (258.2 pits/mm2) and even higher to that of
browser taxa (495.8 pits/mm2). Within the extant browsing, only Alces alces has a higher recorded value of density
of pits. The mountain grazer O. canadensis also displays a
great abundance of pits, 1005 pits/mm2 [14]. This sheep
occupies rock and steep grounds [35] on which forbs and
ligneous plants constitute 19% and 17.5% of its diet,
respectively [23,34]. However, this proportion of plants
would not be high enough to justify the abundance of
pits. From living on dry and dusty habitats, the frequency
of pits in the bighorn could be produced if grass blades
were picked up from their base, since excessive dust and
grit could easily enter the mouth [14]. In the same way as
O. canadensis, the high pit densities that exceed those of
extant browsing species cannot be solely explained by the
intake of browse. It also indicates that P. ginsburgi ingested
a certain amount of inert particles such as dust and grit.
Because a large degree of pitting is displayed in most of
the specimens, it was likely an encroachment of exogenous material on food items during all year round, while
browse was probably enjoyed seasonally or regionally.
The relatively pitted signature of the grazer specimens
makes persistent grit exposure when these forms incorporated grasses seasonally into their dietary regimes.
We explore the similarities among the microwear pattern
of P. ginsburgi and 28 current ungulates by means of hierarchical cluster analysis (Fig. 3A). The taxa are distributed
into two main clusters separating clearly those with a preference to browse fruits and leafs (cluster Browsers) from
those of graze (cluster Grazers). The fossil deer appears
grouped in this second main cluster close to O. canadensis,
C. sumatraensis, T. oryx and K. ellipsiprymnus (subcluster

G.2.2). A probable seasonal preference for graze is appreciated in this group of taxa. The species included in this
subcluster, with the exception of K. ellipsiprymnus, show
two distinct forms of microwear; one typical of browsing,
and one of grazing (Fig. 2A), because some of the individuals browsed right before death while others grazed [13].
This fact is traditionally considered as a seasonality signal.
We use discriminant analysis to force the classification of
P. ginsburgi into an established feeding style. In order to
avoid a decrease in the discriminant consistency, the
mountain grazer feeding style was not considered in the
analysis because it is only formed by O. canadensis. Consequently, this species was included as a seasonal mixed
feeder [6].
The analysis was developed using as criterion variables
density of scars (Table 3). A very high discrimination is
given among the 28 extant ungulates with a classification
rate of 82.1%. It must be noted that most misclassifications were realized from the leaf-browser toward the fruitbrowser style, and in the reciprocal direction. Cephalophus
niger stands out in terms of having scratch densities within
the leaf browsing scratch range. The apparent consumption of fruits and seeds with relatively soft coverings [6],
compared to the other fruit browsers, can be the explanation for this microwear pattern. Muntiacus muntjak mixed
feeder was placed in the category of fruit browsers. However, there are individual differences which may have to
do with the relative hardness of fruit coverings and/or
seed coats or with the relative amounts of these items consumed. These differences result in a variable number of
scratches [6]. Importantly, no species were classed as a
grazer while being a browser, and vice versa.
Most of the specimens, as well as the average of P. ginsburgi, were classified as seasonal mixed feeders (Table 3).
These specimens fall between the browser and grazer
domains, and some others fall into the grazers and others
fall into the browsers (either fruit or leaf dominated, Fig.

4A). By displaying affinities from these different trophic
categories, the wear produced by the last items consumed
prior to death classifies P. ginsburgi into the seasonal
mixed category (Table 3, Fig. 4A).
Analysis of Mesowear Features
The mesowear signal seen in P. ginsburgi is characterised
by the predominance of round cusps (75%) and high
relief (92.5%) and also by significant proportions of sharp
(13.75%) and blunt (11.25%) cusps (Table 1, Fig. 2B).
This pattern responds to that found in species with some
abrasive diets and is clearly different to both the strict
browser and strict grazer taxa. The percentages of cusp
shape and occlusal relief are close to those of the Indian
monsoon forest Cervus duvauceli, Axis axis, Cervus unicolor
and Tetracerus quadricornis and to the African Ourebia
ourebi conservative mixed feeders [4]. All these species
show a highly abrasion-dominated wear, but only C.
duvauceli, and A. axis show a grazerlike profile with over
20% of blunt cusps (Fig. 5). In fact, both species together
with T. quadricornis and O. ourebi are indeed treated as
grazers in the "radical" classification [4]. Some recent
studies even report that the O. ourebi is a pure grazer [36].
In fact, particularly interesting is its behaviour, since it is
considered the most primitive of the extant grazing ruminants concerning the feeding style [37]. It grazes at least
eleven different herbs during the wet season when fresh
grass is readily available, and it browses the foliage from
seven different trees when drought occurs and fresh grass
is less common [37].

P. ginsburgi specimens (scale bar 200 µm). Intensive scratching
(1) is probably justifiable as a consequence of the consumption of fresh grasses in a wet season while the intensive pitting (2) suggests a likely intake of browse (fruits, hard seeds)
during a dry season. Large pitting seen in both forms of
microwear is consistent with the exogenous particle
encroachment on food items during the whole year (a pit is
defined as large when its maximum diameter exceeds 15
µm). (B) Mesowear features. Low relief and blunt cusps

rounded cusps (4;MPZ-6353-m2, 5;MPZ-6311-M1 and 6;MPZ2007/6-m1). Scale bar 1 cm.

The similarities among the mesowear pattern of P. ginsburgi and a set of 51 well-known extant species [4] were
also obtained by means of hierarchical cluster analysis.
The taxa are distributed into three main clusters separating clearly those with mixed dietary trends (cluster Mixed)
from those with preference to browse (cluster Browsers)
and to graze (cluster Grazers). P. ginsburgi appears clearly
separated from the browser taxa. The fossil deer is thus
grouped with C. unicolor, and O. ourebi mixed feeders and
with Hyaemoschus aquaticus fruit browser. It also appears
close to A. lichtenstanii and H. niger grazers (in the subcluster M.2.2, Fig. 3B). Removing the problematic fruitbrowser class ("mabra" group, see methods section), did
not affect the relative placement of the remaining species,
and even P. ginsburgi fell in homologous clusters between
the different data sets.
Discriminant analyses were performed to quantify the resolution of mesowear analysis applied to P. ginsburgi with
respect to the four conventional dietary classes of fruit and
leaf browser, grazer, and mixed feeder. The combination
of rounded, blunt cusps and high relief and two dietary
classifications (conservative and radical) alternately as a
grouping variable was used in this study (Table 4).

highly important regarding the percentage of blunt cusps
(Fig. 5). Species that are well known to be highly frugivorous have a small percentage of blunt cusps, probably
because of tip-crushing wear due to frugivory [4]. The
rounding of their cusps is also probably due to this. Blunt
cusps are only seen in Cephalophus, less than 5% in most
of cases, while absent in Heterohyrax and Dendrohyrax.
Therefore, an important degree of dental abrasion is displayed by P. ginsburgi, which is probably justifiably interpreted as proportion of grass in the food. In line with this
case, the dental wear analysis of extinct brachydont Rangifer with extremely blunt teeth, clearly shares strong affinities with extant mixed feeders [38].
Because of this abrasion-dominated mesowear signal, as
discussed above, P. ginsburgi could be one of these several
mixed feeder species misclassified as frugivorous.
When the problematic "mabra" group [4] was weeded out
of the data, set the percentage of correctly classified notably increased for both the conservative (76.7% correct)
and radical (74.4% correct) dietary classifications (Table
4B,C). Then, the most probable dietary assignment for P.
ginsburgi based on the long term dietary effect corresponds
either to a mixed feeder according to the conservative classification, or to a grazer according to the radical (Table
4B,C, Fig. 4).

Discussion
Data and arguments from two independent methodologies based on dental wear failed to conclude that Procervulus ginsburgi was a browser, as can be expected by the
considerable brachydont cheek teeth. Conversely, the
Artesilla extinct species is firmly placed close to mixed
feeder extant species displaying that brachydonty does not
necessarily imply exclusive browsing in deer.
Today, the use of grass and browse by herbivores depends,
to a large extent, on competition between species of herbivores, food availability and avoidance of predation [5].

Before the advent of species whose teeth present morphologies that suggest adaptations for grass-eating, especially
of bovids, P. ginsburgi could have had a greater relative
grazing capacity and was able to digest a higher grassy diet
than was previously expected for a brachydont species
today. A wear rate at the lower end of the mixed feeder
range would be supported assuming a twinning rate of at
least 1.2 to keep a viable population. It appears that P.
ginsburgi could have managed comfortably on a seasonal
mixed feeding style grazing probably fresh grasses in the
wet season and browsing various foliages, seeds and fruits
during the dry season.
This relative inferred grazing capacity, and therefore grass
availability, is also consistent with the vegetation data. Little information exists about plant remains from the
Calatayud-Daroca basin, but recent data [39] confirm the
presence and significance of graminoids in the nearby
Lower Miocene Rubielos de Mora basin (Teruel, Spain).
The evidence of Myrica and Cornus genera and some Lauraceae family shrubs, also found in this basin, could easily
have constituted part of the ligneous material consumed
by P. ginsburgi.
The palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of Artesilla
would be quite imprecise, raising doubts about how open
the habitat was or how widespread were grasses. However,
high pitting produced by the last items consumed prior to
death of P. ginsburgi, cannot be only explained by browse,
and may reflect more arid and open habitats than were
supposed in previous reconstructions, where the environmental conditions would facilitate the deposit and the
adhesion to food items of grit and dust. Since some seasonal food differences have also been detected, it may
have occupied different areas during the seasonal cycle.
These interpretations lead us to conclude that during the
latest Early Miocene (Zone C, MN4), P. ginsburgi would
arise at a time of increasing aridity, openness and seasonality in the Calatayud-Daroca basin.

Reconstructing evolutionary history of hypsodonty (A) and feeding style (B) in Cervidae
Reconstructing evolutionary history of hypsodonty (A) and feeding style (B) in Cervidae. Characters are traced
onto a tree topology based on a recent molecular phylogeny [55] using MacClade 4.0.6 [56]. Two outgroups are considered
for tracing displays of ancestral character states, A. americana and a clade formed by G. granti and T. imberbis bovids with M.
moschiferus, following the mentioned molecular analysis. Data of extant taxa from [1], [5] and [9]. P. ginsburgi and Dicrocerus elegans are included in the cladogram as stem representatives of extant cervids. Also included were Stockoceros onusrosagris antilocaprid [9], closely related to A. americana, and Eotragus sansaniensis bovid [11] to obtain more reliable ancestral characters.
The ordered type is assigned for reconstructing the transitions of feeding style from assumptions reported in [5], while the
irreversible type is assumed to be the hypsodonty evolution [21]. Dental wear data of extinct species from [9] and [13].

Data presented here for P. ginsburgi reveal that grazing
habits in the Cervidae were acquired prior to the development of hypsodonty (Fig. 6A). High-crowned cheek teeth
do not usually appear to be decreased in evolution once it
has evolved [21]. However, regarding feeding, the mixed
feeder state is a flexible evolutionary state that acts as a
link between browser and grazer states [5]. Thus, the three
established feeding styles were acquired independently in
various lineages of both telemetacarpal and plesiometacarpal deer having in some cases, no relationship with the
evolution of hypsodonty (Fig. 6B). Assuming the ancestral
browser state for cervids to be true [11,15], this would
result in the equivocal character tracing on certain
branches especially in the node for plesiometacarpal deer.
If Dicrocerus elegans mixed feeder [13] is included in the
cladogram, the equivocal tracing is extended to the node
for Cervidae. This ambiguity is resolved when an ancestral
mixed feeding state is assumed to be present in P. gins-

burgi. These data corroborate previous studies [13] that
suggested that mixed feeding was not only a transitional
state and link between browsing and grazing [5], but also,
and more important, the initial state from which both
were evolved. Earliest cervids could have been physiologically qualified to browse and graze, but the morphological expression of this facultative mixed condition would
have depended on environmental conditions. Therefore,
it could be expected that a variable spectrum of feeding
strategies, from strict browsing to grass-dominated mixed
feeding, will be found among Early Miocene cervids without any hypsodonty increase would have taken place.
Was this facultative mixed state a first advantage exclusive
of Cervidae or could it also have been the starting point of
other ruminant lineages? The mixed feeder strategy newly
obtained for P. ginsburgi contributes to tip the balance in
favour of a mixed condition as the primitive dietary state

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:13

of the Ruminantia. In fact, the evolutionary scenario built
to Cervidae seems to be about the same that the already
found for other ruminant clades.
Regarding low-crowned molar groups, and therefore traditionally characterised as browsers, gross craniodental
analysis and wear methodologies gathered from some
extinct Giraffidae and Dromomerycidae have revealed the
appearance of grazing adaptations early on in their evolution [7,10,14]. Interestingly, if a wider range of dietary
habits than was previously expected for their brachydonty
is early represented in the families, an ancestral mixed
condition could have also been feasible.
With respect to hypsodont clades, the earlier and more
primitive merycodonts which were apparently qualified
to graze from their first occurrences, both browsed and
grazed seasonally and regionally, despite having these
high tooth crowns. Also, the first antilocaprines were
mixed feeders, while the latter apparently consumed grass
on a more frequent basis and shifted to browsing dietary
regimes only in the early Pleistocene [40].
As far as we know, the only other data regarding early
information available, concern the archaic bovid Eotragus
sansaniensis from the Middle Miocene (MN6) locality of
Sansan (France). Results from our study may shed light to
propose a particular evolutionary scenario and thus
explain the apparent contradiction that supposes the
browsing diet [11] of E. sansaniensis. If increased molar
crown height is recognized as an adaptation for grass eating, it should be assumed that this bovid, displaying a
higher degree of hypsodonty (although still brachydont)
than P. ginsburgi mixed feeder, would evolve from an
ancestor that enjoyed more grasses in the past. In fact, the
oldest known horned bovid of Africa, Namacerus
gariepensis (ca 17.5 Ma), could already have incorporated
grass in its diet having a precocious grade of hypsodonty
[41]. In Sansan locality, E. sansaniensis is the only bovid
and it coexisted with another five ruminant taxa, of which
cervoids are clearly predominant. Its molar height should
suggest at least a mixed feeding, and however, in the faunal assemblage of Sansan, the large Dicrocerus elegans
occupied this niche. The high abundance of D. elegans, an
exclusive case in the Miocene ruminant fauna, would support a gregarious behaviour coherent with the fact of
being the only extinct deer with antlered females [42], and
only comparable with the extant Rangifer. It is perhaps not
surprising to think that in a flourishing time of cervoid
groups, they were prone to inhabit a broad range of feeding niches. Therefore, it was not easy for Eotragus, the first
immigrant bovid in Europe, to replace deer if they were
perfectly established in the mixed niche, as the scarce
available data suggest. Since the Sansan diversity of ruminants was large, dietary differentiation may have been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/13

necessary for the survival of E. sansaniensis. Thus, it could
be compatible with our assumptions that E. sansaniensis
would have occupied a browser regime due to strong competition, although being physiologically and morphologically adapted to feed on mixed diet.
Ruminant ancestor, and even basal clades as tragulids,
consumed a variety of different vegetations [6], they may
also have ingested animal matter, despite the brachydont
nature of their cheek teeth. Similarly, early pecorans could
have preserved a certain degree of this opportunism
through a mixed feeding strategy. Higher ruminants could
have been physiologically qualified to both browse and
graze, i.e. a facultative mixed state, from their first appearance. Therefore, vegetal resources accessibility, climatic
conditions and competition between species could have
been the factors in controlling the expression of different
feeding styles. Browse-eating would be the most efficient
specialization for obtaining required nutrients when a
continued predominance of high nutritional forage is prevailing, despite the possible existence of grasses. If seasonality and aridity restrict the nourishing vegetal resources,
ruminants would be forced to display mixed feeder strategies to extract nutrients from a wide variety of vegetation.
Early grass-dominated mixed feeders would thus have
grazed only for a short season each year, but this might
have been crucial for their survival. Exclusive grazing habits would arise at a time of increasing seasonal dryness and
development of more open habitats, as an adaptation to
increase harvesting efficiency and reduce food search
(since grasses typically grow in continuous dispersion). In
fact, climates became drier and more seasonal in the middle Miocene when the Antarctic ice sheet was near-permanent [43]. Grazing species, therefore, could invest less
time by making decisions on how to maximize nutrient
intake than did browsers, and could therefore gain time
for other essential activities, such as reproducing and
avoiding predators [44]. Finally, browse specialization
would become possible just after the spreading of open
habitats if competition between ruminant herbivores was
increased.

Conclusion
Despite the traditional characterization of first deer as specialised leaf-eating, our analysis of molar crown height
and dental wear strongly supports that Procervulus ginsburgi, while having low-crowned molars, exhibited a strategy typical of seasonal mixed feeders. Thus, it seems more
likely that Cervidae were originally leaf-grass mixed feeders. Important dietary heterogeneity among other ruminant clades suggests that a facultative mixed state may in
fact have been the primitive dietary state of the Ruminantia, which would have been morphologically expressed
only under specific environmental factors. However,
more palaeodietary investigations on first records of early

Page 10 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:13

taxa from different localities are nevertheless needed to
validate the presumptions proposed here. In the light of
these data, future palaeoecological studies should take
into account that some terms, such as "low-crowned
molars", "leaf-eating species" and "forest environments",
are not strictly associated, at least not for the Cervidae.

Methods
Location and Data Collection
The Aragonian deposits of Artesilla (Lower Miocene) near
Villafeliche (province of Zaragoza, North Central Spain),
have been the object of several palaeontological excavations during the ninetieth. Magnetostratigraphic [45] and
biostratigraphic [46] analyses in the Aragonian Type section have dated Artesilla at 16.51 Ma and placed it to the
local Zone C and Mein'zone MN4.

Very well preserved P. ginsburgi upper (n = 14) and lower
(n = 26) molar teeth belonging to a minimum of 21 individuals from the deposit of Artesilla were available for
study. The specimens are housed at the Museo Paleontológico de la Universidad de Zaragoza (Zaragoza, Spain).
Associated Fauna
The faunal assemblage is varied and extensive, with at
least 38 vertebrate taxa of which 20 are large mammals.
Despite the presence of Megacricetodon collongensis, Zone C
cricetid indicator, Van der Meulen and Daams [47] considered the association more similar to Zone B due to the
scarcity of the forest dweller Ligerimys. Artesilla site also
represents the oldest record of possible African origin
immigrants as creodonts (Hyainailouros), felids (Afrosmilus) and Proboscideans (Prodeinotherium and Gomphotherium). The fossil bovids also constitute part of these
immigrants in zone C but they are not present in Artesilla.
Ruminants are dominated by the cervoid taxa Procervulus
and Ampelomeryx. Due to the predominance of brachydont species as well as the presence of deinotherids and
tragulids, the large mammal association was related with
a closed and humid palaeoenvironment [48].
Dietary Assessment Methodologies
Several techniques developed in recent years have
focussed on reconstructing dietary preferences in ungulates. Craniodental morphological and morphometric
analyses have divided ungulates into the known categories [2,49,50]. However, they cannot be applied because
they require the complete preservation of specific pieces
which are not available in our sample. Stable isotope techniques have also tested a connection between the isotopic
composition of tissues records and diet and have provided
important dietary insights [51,52]. Since the study is
based on the carbon isotopic distinction between C3 and
C4 photosynthesis and due to C4 monocots is not
detected in the Mediterranean region [51] where Artesilla

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/13

material was collected, it is not possible to document dietary preferences from stable carbon isotope data. Thus,
only the following procedures can be used in the research
for interpreting the dietary regime in P. ginsburgi and
reconstructing the environment of Artesilla.
Dental Crown Height
To test the relationship between hypsodonty (i.e. the
increased molar crown height) and feeding style, the
lower third unworn molar teeth (n = 5) were measured
using an index (HIm3) defined as the unworn m3 height
divided by m3 width (1,3), and classified "brachydont
ungulates" as a HIm3 < 1.5, "mesodont ungulates" as a 1.5
< HIm3 < 2.5 and "hypsodont ungulates" as a HIm3 > 2.5.
Dental Microwear
The method applied for this study was performed following a procedure previously developed [11] and widely
used by other authors.

Microscopic scar observation was made by means of an
Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope FEI Quanta
200. Images were taken systematically at a magnification
of ×500 in a 0.20 mm2 delimited area and were treated
with Microware 4.02 [53]. Microwear dimensions were
directly categorized on the basis of the ratio length/width
(pits: ratio = 4, scratches: 4 < ratio < 100) by this software.
The study examined the anterior lingual blade of the paracone on the M2 (n = 4) and the posterior buccal blade of
the protoconid on the m2 (n = 9) permanent.
Dental microwear comparisons were made using a dataset
[14] partitioned into the leaf browsing (n = 7), fruit
browsing (n = 3), grazing (n = 7), mountain grazer (n = 1),
seasonal (n = 6) and non-seasonal mixed feeder (n = 4)
categories. Note that the "non-seasonal mixed feeder"
term is synonym of "meal by meal mixed feeder" from [6].
Number of scratches and pits, variables commonly
adopted for analysis, were transformed into a density
score [23] in order to simplify the comparison of P. ginsburgi with other extant ungulates. Quantitative analysis
was performed using the dataset of 28 well-known extant
ungulates compiled by [14] and sharing the same protocol concerning high magnification (×500) and SEM.
Dental Mesowear
Occlusal relief (characterized as either high or low) and
the cusp shape (characterized as either sharp, rounded, or
blunt) of the apex of the paracone and metacone of the
M1–M3(n = 14) and the metaconid and entoconid of the
m1–m3 (n = 26) were examined by the naked eye (and
occasionally using a stereomicroscope Olympus SZ11)
and qualitatively scored. A comparative extant database

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:13

with known diets was followed as a reference [4] from
which small samples represented by less than 15 individuals were removed in order to obtain a range in which distributions that look different become significantly
different statistically. The mesowear pattern stabilizes
after about 20 or 30 individuals, and usually gives a reasonable approximation after about 10 [4]. The dental
mesowear of fossil species was then compared to a set of
51 well-known extant ungulates composed of conservative fruit (n = 7), and leaf browsing (n = 9), conservative
grazing (n = 11) and conservative mixed feeder species (n
= 24). The duikers and hyraxes constitute part of the fruiteaters as a special case ("mabra", for "minute abraded
brachydont") showing quite unclear dental wear. Note
also that some doubtful cases are treated as intermediate
(mixed feeder) in the conservative classification and as
extreme (browser or grazer) in the radical classification
and could be considered variable browsers and variable
grazers, respectively. As recommended by [31], we used all
available upper molars except for those in very early and
very late wear. Because the mesowear method relies on the
wear process itself, it is least reliable for the most brachydont species [31], and the results for Procervulus must
therefore be treated with particular caution.
Statistical Analyses
Multivariate analyses for ascertaining the most probable
feeding style in P. ginsburgi were performed using SPSS
11.5 [54]. Hierarchical cluster analysis was applied as an
explorative technique for identifying herbivorous species
groups and emphasizing any inherent structure, based on
similarities in wear pattern. The analysis was realized
using the Euclidean distance and Ward's method. Discriminant analysis was also employed to evaluate the ability
of the dental variables set with the purpose of distinguishing between the known feeding styles of extant species
and also to classify the P. ginsburgi cases according to the
model derived.

It was found that cluster diagrams with an index of hypsodonty showed no difference with that obtained when
this variable was excluded. It has also been proved that
discriminant models that include bovids as a part of an
extant data set are prone to classify the fossil taxa as
browsers when hypsodonty is included [7]. For these reasons and through being considered an independent methodology in research, hypsodonty was reasonably excluded
from the analyses based on dental wear.
