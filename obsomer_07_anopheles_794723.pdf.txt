Abstract
Background: The Anopheles dirus complex includes efficient malaria vectors of the Asian forested
zone. Studies suggest ecological and biological differences between the species of the complex but
variations within species suggest possible environmental influences. Behavioural variation might
determine vector capacity and adaptation to changing environment. It is thus necessary to clarify
the species distributions and the influences of environment on behavioural heterogeneity.
Methods: A literature review highlights variation between species, influences of environmental
drivers, and consequences on vector status and control. The localisation of collection sites from
the literature and from a recent project (MALVECASIA) produces detailed species distributions
maps. These facilitate species identification and analysis of environmental influences.
Results: The maps give a good overview of species distributions. If species status partly explains
behavioural heterogeneity, occurrence and vectorial status, some environmental drivers have at
least the same importance. Those include rainfall, temperature, humidity, shade, soil type, water
chemistry and moon phase. Most factors are probably constantly favourable in forest. Biological
specificities, behaviour and high human-vector contact in the forest can explain the association of
this complex with high malaria prevalence, multi-drug resistant Plasmodium falciparum and partial
control failure of forest malaria in Southeast Asia.
Conclusion: Environmental and human factors seem better than species specificities at explaining
behavioural heterogeneity. Although forest seems essential for mosquito survival, adaptations to
orchards and wells have been recorded. Understanding the relationship between landscape
components and mosquito population is a priority in foreseeing the influence of land-cover changes
on malaria occurrence and in shaping control strategies for the future.

Background
Throughout most of their geographical distribution, species of the Anopheles dirus complex are associated with
high malaria prevalence rates and the occurrence of drug
resistant Plasmodium falciparum [1,2]. The biological spe-

cificities of these efficient vectors undermine the most
popular control measures and challenge the success of
malaria control. Sporadic studies on sympatric sibling
species from the complex suggest ecological and biological differences in types of larval habitat, seasonality and

behaviour according to species [3-5] but such differences
also occur for specific species within their distributions
and could relate to key environmental factors. Variation
in behaviour, such as early biting or ovipositing in wells,
might determine vector capacity and adaptation to changing environment. It is thus of interest to clarify the geographical distributions of the species, the importance of
environmental factors and the influences of ecological
variation on behavioural heterogeneity.
If the biology of An.dirus s.l. (sensu lato, i.e. An. dirus complex) is well documented in the literature, no attempt has
been made recently to compile this information. A major
difficulty resides in the taxonomic changes which have
affected the group throughout the last 50 years [4,6,7].
Furthermore, only recently did molecular tools allow
identification of individuals from this group up to the species level and they rely on strenuous methods or require
sophisticated equipment. As a result, most of the available
articles do not provide specific species identification.
Fortunately, the taxonomy of the complex has recently
been clarified and the species named [4,8]. The complex
belongs to the Anopheles (Cellia) leucosphyrus group in the
Neomyzomyia Series [6] and now includes at least seven
species: Anopheles dirus or An. dirus sensu stricto (s.s.),

Peyton, et al. 1979 [48 ]

Anopheles crascens, Anopheles scanloni, Anopheles baimaii,
Anopheles elegans (previously known as species E), Anopheles nemophilous and Anopheles takasagoensis [4,8]. The species previously called Anopheles elegans from Sri Lanka [9]
and Southern India [10] has now been renamed Anopheles
mirans and is not part of the complex [4]. Evolution of the
complex and correspondence with historical names are
presented in Figure 1.
Based on those taxonomic clarifications, existing distribution maps of these species [11] can now be updated using
data from collection sites available in the literature and
from the recent project MALVECASIA on monitoring
insecticide resistance in Southeast Asia. Localisation of
collection sites can facilitate identification of the species
in articles lacking this information and provide the background for analysis of spatial distribution, biology, behaviour, vectorial status and key ecological factors of
individual species.
This article thus aims to, 1) update the distributions of
members of the An. dirus complex using literature records
and personal data, 2) to provide an overview of intra- and
inter- species variation of biology and behaviour and 3) to
identify key ecological factors influencing the behaviour

distribution, occurrence and vectorial status of An. dirus
s.l.

Methods
The basis for the paper is a comprehensive analysis of
more than a hundred articles examined for the following
items: information on geographical dispersion, species
identification methods, behaviour of adults and larvae,
and environmental factors influencing occurrence and
behaviour. Key papers on taxonomy and population
structure were first reviewed to associate historical species
records with currently recognized species.
More than five hundred collection sites were then spatially located. They include literature records but also
recent data from the MALVECASIA network, a research
network of eight partners that studied the distribution and
insecticide resistance of malaria vectors in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand. This information was gathered
in a table, and maps were produced to plot the collection
sites on a vegetation background adapted from the global
dataset Global Land Cover 2000[12]. This background
represents what is thought to be a forested habitat from a
mosquito's point of view. It includes the following original classes: evergreen and deciduous forest, open or
closed, including mixed leaf type, flooded forest, mosaic
of tree cover and other natural vegetation as well as
mosaic of cropland, tree cover and other natural vegetation. The accuracy of site location depends on the available information: the maximum accuracy is obtained when
the coordinates are provided in the original article. In
most of the other cases, the extended Geographical Information System (SEAGIS) gathered and organized by the
MALVECASIA network [13] provided the necessary tools
to find an accurate location. Maps or detailed site descriptions were compared with datasets such as village databases, administrative maps, roads, rivers, vegetation and
altitude. Some collection sites could not be accurately
located using the above mentioned methods which made
it necessary to look for locations in gazetteers [14].
For each site number, the sibling species identified in the
reviewed publication is recorded, as well as the identification methods. Considerable uncertainty may result from
some of these methods [15] and the distinction between
An. dirus s.s. and An. scanloni remains problematic. Morphological keys based on reared adults with associated larval and pupal exuviae[16], polytene chromosomal
banding patterns[17], enzyme electromorph [18], allelespecific polymerase chain reaction (ASPCR) [15,19] and
random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) [20] are a
few of the existing identification methods. Sallum et al.
provided a complete list [4]. Species status can be extrapolated from the map, for sites located in allopatric zones.

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/6/1/26

The species spatial distribution is first discussed. Then larval and adult ecology and behaviour are analysed to highlight possible variation between species. The influence of
environmental drivers and land-cover is then considered
as well as the consequences for vector status and control.

Results and Discussion
Species spatial distribution
A map first shows the overall extent of the An. dirus complex distribution (Figure 2). A second map focuses on
Southeast Asia, where the species diversity and the
number of records are higher (Figure 3). In this area, the
presence of An. dirus s.l. seems to correspond to presence
of malaria cases. The additional file 1 allows better reading of the maps. It indicates the reviewed publication, the
species discovered and the identification method used for
each site. As it was not graphically possible to display individually the more than 500 sites, sites close to each other
are represented by a single point on the map and a single
reference number. The additional files (Additional file 2,
3 and 4) associated with the current article provide a
description of the site, collection methods and the
number of An. dirus s.l. collected, as well as the original
location for each of the 500 sites organized by site number
or by reviewed publication. The current article is also
aimed at malaria control workers, and with this information, they can find the situation recorded at any of the collection sites in the past, as well as locate any collection site
cited in the publications reviewed.

Species of the An. dirus complex can be found in forest
and forest foothills from India to Taiwan and from the
30° north parallel to the Malaysian peninsular. The mean
monthly temperature below 20° seems to limit the northern distribution of the complex to just beyond the border
of India with Nepal and Bhutan. Rainfall is probably the
limiting factor to the west with annual rainfall per year
under 800 mm. The absence of species of the complex in
large non-forested areas of Thailand, southern Vietnam
and central India is probably linked to the lack of suitable
habitat. However the species of the complex are also
absent from the north of Vietnam. This is most peculiar,
given that this area is still forested and that members of
the complex occur at the same latitude in neighbouring
countries. The possible occurrence of An. dirus s.l. in central India was investigated by Srivastava [21]. A predictive
model identifying suitable factors for Anopheles survival
and the distribution of wet evergreen and deciduous forest
confirmed the presence of An. dirus s.l. in already wellknown areas of occurrence, but also in a few suitable sites
through central and North-Western India. This seems to
correspond to historical collection sites in Uttar Pradesh,
Kerala and Karnakata. Bhat [22] and Rajavel [7] also cite
historical records in Kasauli and other regions now considered free of An. dirus s.l. Recent reports of the presence

of An. dirus s.l. in the state of Jharkhand (Dr. Diwakar
Dinesh, personal communication) call for further investigation into the actual distribution of the complex in India.
Those areas are presented in Figure 2 as sites with presence
suspected but not confirmed.
Regarding the species distributions within the range of the
complex, there are no major geographic or topographic
reasons that seem to justify the current species distribution pattern. Therefore, speciation probably does not
result from adaptation to a specific environment but the
species might have been isolated for some time. Their distribution most probably reflects geo-morphological
changes which have occurred in the past and are today not
evident [3]. The mountains of the Western Ghats in southern India are the most westward limit of the complex with
the presence of An. elegans [10,23] apparently isolated
from the other species. The closest records to this area
come then from the north eastern states in India [24] and

the border of Nepal [25], and are considered to be An. baimaii based on identification in nearby Bangladesh [26].
An. baimaii seems to be the main species in Myanmar,
occurring throughout the country, then giving way to An.
dirus s.s. eastward from western Thailand. An. dirus s.s. is
the only species recorded so far in Vietnam, Lao, Cambodia [27-29] and Hainan Island [30]. An. crascens is confined to southern Thailand and Malaysia[31], and An.
takasagoensis to Taiwan [32]. An. scanloni and An. nemophilous seem to have more patchy distributions. An. scanloni
is restricted to western and southern Thailand, whereas
the distribution of An. nemophilous closely follows monsoon forests. The south of Thailand and the Thai – Myanmar border present various sites of high sympatry for
several species of the complex [3].
Some clarifications are still called for. Variations of ITS2
rDNA usually occur only between sibling species, thus
intraspecific variations between populations of An. baim-

aii from Thailand and site 302 in China, and An. scanloni
at sites 175 and 195 suggest the possible existence of two
new species [15], with a less diverse population at site 195
indicating a period of isolation[33].
There is need for some investigations at the Thai-Cambodian border, the border between Lao and China and some
areas in Myanmar. Indeed, although only An. dirus s.s
seems to occur in Cambodia, two specimens of An. baimaii were earlier recorded near to the border in Thailand at
site 241 [34] and specimens at the border have been
observed to feed on monkeys in the canopy as would An.
nemophilous in nearby Thailand [35]. Only An. dirus s.s.
has been recorded in Lao although An. baimaii occurs
nearby in China. Unexpected records such as An. dirus s.s.
at site 49 [36] and 148 [37], and An. scanloni at site 126
[37], should be taken with caution and investigated further. This is also the case for records of An. baimaii at site
241, which are based on the collection of only two specimens. Sallum et al. [4] reported the presence of An. crascens in Sumatra but gave no reference.
Larval habitats
Primary and secondary larval habitats of An. dirus s.l. have
some constant characteristics: temporary, standing or
slowly moving water under shade. While primary sites
occur year round and tend to be associated with the
stream system in deep forest, they vary in nature according
to the season with drying pools in stream beds, pools connected with streams or meanders of slow moving streams
in the dry season [38-40], complemented in the rainy season by pools fed by underground seepage along streams,
springs, rock pools in the beds of ravines, and in deep
holes or pits which form ahead of gullies [32,39,41]. Such
primary sites are often confined to the deep forest resulting in transmission of malaria mainly to forest workers.
Some of them however occur in peri-domestic area: An.
dirus s.s. occurs in gem pits [42] and in water pits fed by
seepage along streams [43]. If wells are generally negative[39,44], An. baimaii occurs in wells close to houses in
a particular area of Myanmar throughout the year [36,4547] even if densities are reduced in the dry season.

Secondary larval habitats occur in the rainy season and
can be found closer to human settlement at the forest
fringe. These are commonly small, shallow, temporary,
shaded water-holding depressions [48]. Puddles in paths
are commonly positive, whereas larger bodies of water
such as ponds, large rivers, irrigation channels and marshy
areas are generally negative. However, An. takasagoensis
breeds in large permanent pools used by buffaloes for
bathing if freshened by the rain [32]. An. dirus s.l. was also
recorded in long marshy areas in the forest of Myanmar
[41] and in two swamps and one rice paddy in Thailand[49]. Artificial containers [39] and natural containers

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/6/1/26

are also generally negative but An. dirus s.s. is found
reported in clay jars in Hainan[2], in a tin-hat[40], empty
tins and in terracotta jars in Vietnam[50]. Positive natural
containers include only bamboo stumps [5,36,40] and
palm leaves [40]. Details on larval habitats and locations
investigated are presented in Figure 4.
Immature stages of An. dirus s.s. and An. baimaii show
adaptations to temporary habitats [39,43]. The eggs survive on the moist floor of a drained pool up to one month
after the rain stops, but not throughout the dry season,
unless sporadic rains prevent the soil from drying or
unless the eggs are on the wet soils of forest. Not only do
the eggs survive between rainfalls but they can also partially mature on a moist surfaces thus reducing development times, with first stage larvae present in pools
containing no water prior to rain [39,43]. Larval stages can
crawl to other pools in case of drying but they can also survive the desiccation of a draining pool and ant predation
by getting covered in a coat of mud and becoming buried
and motionless just before complete drainage. On reflooding, only An. dirus s.l. reappears at the surface thus
eliminating other competitors. An. dirus s.l. immature
stages can feed on the larvae of other species and less frequently on its own larvae, in particular under crowded
conditions [39]. Increased larval density results in higher
larval mortality[36] and the production of smaller adults
even with the same amount of food per larva, suggesting
an influence on feeding efficiency rather than a shortage
of food per se [51].
For a sibling species, larval habitats seem quite diverse
according to location but Baimai [3] recorded a preference
for vegetated limestone rock pools for An. scanloni and
rocky-stony micro-environments for An. dirus s.s., An. crascens and An. baimaii. Sympatric populations of An. dirus
s.s. and An. baimaii share identical larval habitat and even
the same pools at site 204 [5]. An. baimaii was, however,
more often found in pools that dried out in dry spells during the rainy season. This might reflect a seasonal variation in larval habitats or species, with An. dirus s.s. more
abundant at the start and An. baimaii during the middle of
the rainy season [3].
Adult particularities and behaviour
An. baimaii and An. dirus s.s. are extremely anthropophilic
[1,52-55], even in the presence of numerous cattle [56],
but less anthropophilic behaviour has been sporadically
recorded for these two species [27,57]. In particular,
higher densities were recorded on cattle in some years
[46] or every year for An. baimaii [58]. Some studies show
that An. nemophilous feeds primarily on monkey, and An.
dirus s.s. and An. scanloni feed more often on humans than
An. crascens. These experiments were however based on
few observations[3]. Monkeys are natural and winter

hosts [2,32,59] but preference for monkey was not evident from human- and monkey-bait collections in the forest. More specimens were caught on human bait on the
ground. As many were caught on monkey bait in the canopy as on human bait on the ground [35]. Anecdotal
records report individual mosquitoes feeding on birds
[56], dogs and pigs [41], as well as mixed feeding on
bovines and humans suggesting that mosquitoes do not
always come back to the same host[57,60,61].
Females are primarily exophagic but enter open shelters to
feed [62]. Variations between regions are linked to housing facilities with the highest endophagy in largely open
houses built directly on the ground [53]. Most open
houses in the jungle show no significant biting differences
between indoors and outdoors [1,56,57,63,64]. In some
cases, indoor biting is even higher [38,43,65].
Resting places are difficult to find and occur mainly outdoors [58,59,66] in holes, wells[36,58,63]and vegetation
such as bushes, tree holes [41,52], thick grass, under the
surfaces of leaves [36,40], branches near the ground [40]
and under the foots of trees[2]. In India, an intensive
search collected none on the ground but 20 from the
moist, dark crevices of large tree trunks, and 2 from creepers in the forest, the nearest at 150 m from a village[66].
Day-resting can be separated from night-resting[67].
Females rest early in the evening in outdoor vegetation,
fences and wood stacked around houses [52,56] but after
feeding, they fly almost immediately back to the jungle[1], with none found even at dawn around dwellings
[43,52]. Eyles [35] caught more An. dirus s.l. in the canopy
than on the ground and when Wilkinson [43] released
hundreds of females in predawn darkness, they flew
immediately upwards into trees suggesting that they
might rest in the canopy of trees.
Biting can happen in daylight in the jungle[38,59] but
occurs mostly from dusk to dawn. From the feeding patterns reported in the literature and presented in Figure 5,
it is not obvious whether or not An. dirus s.l. is a late night
feeder or an early night feeder. Scanlon [62] emphasised
that late night feeding is most common in Thailand but
that occasionally local populations exhibit a striking early
pattern. The peak feeding activity has also been recorded
either late [52] or early [68] in the same location for different years. Species-specific patterns of outdoor biting
were suggested for allopatric populations with a very early
peak for An. scanloni, and An. crascens, around 22h for An.
dirus s.s. and 02h for An. baimaii [3]. An. dirus s.s. and An.
baimaii are, however, both often recorded as late night
feeders [1,2,27,35,48,69,70], but peak activity was also
recorded well before midnight for An. takasagoensis and
An. baimaii [32,41,46,57,71]. The occurrence of a particular sibling species can thus not explain all the variation.

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/6/1/26

Other influencing factors seem to include the moon
phase, the season and the presence of DDT, which stimulates early biting [59,63]. A two-year survey at site 12
recorded wide a repeated variation of the feeding pattern
in accordance with the moon phase [59]. Variations have
also been recorded between years and seasons
[34,36,46,59] with earlier peak activity in the dry season[27] or earlier peak activity in October than in June
[63]. Late biting in post-monsoon in some regions might
also be due to the late onset of dawn [60]. Compilation of
data across years, seasons, moon phases or between
indoor and outdoor biting can thus result in a wide variety
of patterns that are difficult to interpret [64]. The Relative
Risk (RR) of being bitten in the hour before 22h compared with an hour after 22h probably provides a better
indicator of exposure. A large proportion of bites before
22h coincide with activities of people before bedtime
when the bed-net protection is nil [53]. Indoor biting
peaks occur often later than outdoor biting [59] but in the
presence of very open houses no difference is observed
[53]. Outdoor biting has been recorded as starting as early
as 16h for An. scanloni [3], and 19h for An. baimaii, An.
dirus s.s. and An. takasagoensis [1,32,38,43,46,72].
Environmental drivers
The occurrence of different sibling species can explain part
of the heterogeneity in behaviour. However, differences
between individuals of the same species underlines the
major role of environmental factors in determining the
occurrence, distribution, seasonality, behaviour and vectorial status for An. dirus s.l. The influence of moon phase
and housing facilities on biting behaviour has already
been discussed. Other keys factors of importance are temperature, rainfall, topography, season, soil type, shade,
water quality and land-cover. These factors interact with
components of the mosquito life cycle on one hand and
with different stages of the parasite cycle on the other.

The occurrence of An. dirus s.l. is mainly linked to rainfall,
temperature and relative humidity [46]. Attacks started
after the rain exceeded 50 mm at site 12 for An. baimaii
[39]. Lower or different thresholds seemed to apply
according to the soil type and topography with, for example, An .dirus s.l. in Hainan [73]. Heavy rains however,
flush away larval habitats, impede mosquitoes from flying
[3,46,74] and the flooded grounds can be unsuitable for
weeks[43]. The pattern of rainfall might, thus, be more
important than the amount of rainfall, and light rains, not
too frequent, seem to be most favourable for larval development [32]. Kitthawee [51] observed that adult body
size was positively correlated with rainfall 1–2 weeks
before. She suggests that renewed rainfall may bring more
particulate food onto the surface of the water where larvae
feed. Conversely, excessive rain could dilute nutrients and
lead to nutritionally stressed, smaller adults. The impor-

tance of the rainfall pattern can explain yearly fluctuations
in populations recorded during different studies in the
same region [28,29,64]. The month of peak densities is
not constant but usually takes place during the rainy season, with up to 80 bites per man/night [75]. Variations of
relative abundance of sibling species in sympatric sites
show more An. crascens than An. baimaii at the beginning
and less An. crascens than An. scanloni at the end of the wet
season at site 175. At site 204, more An. dirus s.s. were
found at the start and more An. baimaii towards the middle of the wet season [3]. Populations of An. takasagoensis
also present high fluctuations in abundance. The species
usually is fairly uncommon but is occasionally very abundant [32].
Temperature is rarely a limiting factor but it influences the
longevity of the mosquito, the length of the sporogonic
cycle and mosquito activity, thus influencing seasonally
the vector status.An. dirus s.l. seems inactive when temperature falls below 15°C [27]. However, in the deep forest
of northern Thailand, during the cool, dry season associated with important temperature fluctuations and
minima around 10°C, An. dirus s.l. can still survive and
even transmit malaria. [63]. The duration of the immature
stages is reduced at higher temperatures but females are
then smaller [36]. If size does not influence the number of
oocysts [76], larger mosquitoes live longer and have thus
a greater vectorial capacity [77]. Mean daytime temperature averages 25.4°C with up to 5°C variation in positive
ground pools [43]. However, in colonised wells temperature remains almost constant (26.2°C), despite outside
temperature oscillations from 19.5 to 33.1°C. The clay
contained in the lateritic wall lining the wells might have
a sustained cooling effect[47].
Topography, salinity, pH and shade also influence the
availability and occurrence of larval habitat. Topography
is a major element with sites found commonly in foothills
where rain water can accumulate, next to streams or in the
beds of ravines. Rosenberg observed that the appearance
of waves of An. dirus s.l. after the rain is not systematic at
site 12 and requires three concomitant elements: rapidly
draining pools, intermittent, heavy rains and embryonated eggs [39]. If suitable pools are temporary, they
should hold water for at least five to eight days [39,66].
Suitability of a site might, thus, be a combination of the
clay content of the soil with the appropriate amount and
frequency of rain. In the sandy soils of site 12, suitable larval habitats occur only on the compacted soil of the path.
The infiltration is too high elsewhere. Where An. baimaii
breeds year-long in wells, the soil outside is not appropriate for larval habitat because it dries out very rapidly by
percolation and evaporation. Even puddles in path are
negative [46] and most wells dry up in summer [45]. Kitthawee [42] noticed that site such as 148 and 243 which

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/6/1/26

presents the particular behaviour of year-long larval development in gem pits or wells also present a particular environmental setting with very high rainfall and infiltration
rates.
Salinity, pH, shade and temperature have been extensively
analysed in the context of An. bamaii in wells in Myanmar.
Nitrate, iron, dissolved oxygen, sulphate, chlorine,
ammonia and water hardness seem to have no influence,
but larval density is negatively correlated to pH in ground
pools and salinity in wells, with a threshold at 200 ppm
NaCl [36,45,47,49]. Larval density becomes very low
when the distance between the well-water surface and the
ground surface is less than 2.5 m, probably reflecting an
effect of shade and temperature [36,47]. Larvae gradually
disappear if the shade is removed. Except for a few records
[5,69], most larval habitats are under the shade of trees
which probably reduces the drying speed of pools, influences temperature and provides food through organic
matter and leaves falling into the water. Positive wells
have shade and shrub on inner walls, debris on the water
surface and often abundant decaying leaves at the bottom,
even if the water is clean [36]. Numerous larvae are even
observed in pools often fouled by buffaloes [2], but An.
dirus s.l. will not be encountered if the water is not freshened frequently by rains [48].
Association with forest
The most important environmental parameter is definitely land-cover. Throughout its distribution An. dirus s.l.
is associated with forested foothills, forests or forest
fringes. If availability of larval habitats and the presence of
natural hosts, such as monkeys [35] are explanatory factors for this association, adults may also require the highest humidity and lower temperature of the jungle biotope
for optimal survival [2]. Favourable environmental conditions of dense vegetation, humid soil, high relative
humidity and shade, coupled with the presence of permanent suitable larval habitats or primary sites, appear to
persist deep inside the forest during the dry season.
Although rainfall in a tropical rain forest is unpredictable,
the forest floor is humid. Even if the larval habitats loose
their free water, the high humidity probably keeps the
eggs viable for fairly long periods until the next rain
comes[2]. The tree cover provides food for larvae, with
leaves and other debris falling into larval habitats and
assures stable micro-climatic conditions, even in the dry
season. As the rainy season begins, conditions also
become favourable at the margins of forest and An. dirus
s.l. seems to spill over from the forest into secondary larval
habitats.

Much larger densities of An. dirus s.s. are present in deep
forest settlements or villages than in villages located at the
edge of forest or in fragmented forests [78]. Variations in

forest are difficult to interpret when mosquito densities
are low near a village, very high at 1.5 km and moderate
at 5 km[1,35,78,79], Infected mosquitoes can be present
at oviposition sites 1.5 to 3 km away from the village [59].
Terracotta jars provided for oviposition in the forest
attracted the highest number of mosquitoes at 150 m
from the village but hardly any 300 m away [29]. Specimens were captured up to 2 km away from a source during
a mark-release-recapture study [80]. These complex and
contradicting results show that all the parameters influencing the occurrence and density of the An. dirus s.l. populations in the forest are not totally understood but the
distance to the potential host and suitability of oviposition site certainly play a major role. The association with
the forest is high in any case and almost systematically
results in high vector contact and malaria transmission.
Species such as An. nemophilous seem to be dependant on
monsoon forest[3]. In Cholbury, Thailand, large populations of An. dirus s.l. were encountered by Scanlon [52] in
1964, but the site has been further deforested and the
population has been considerably reduced. However,
adaptation to other land-cover has been recorded, particularly to teak and rubber plantations and orchards. The
mosquitoes can adapt to the edge of man-made clearings
[39,48,81] and have once been recorded in rice fields [49].
However, it is not known,, if large forested areas are necessary for the survival of these vector populations or if
fragmented forest or plantations might be sufficient. The
particular behaviour of year-long oviposition in wells
might be a consequence of an adaptation to a new type of
larval habitat and resting places that provide a cooler and
more constant temperature, corresponding to the forest
biotope [47].
Vector status and control
The role played by An. dirus s.l. in the transmission of
malaria has only been assessed during the last 50 years. It
is now considered as the most important vector in Southeast Asia. Several factors contribute to making species of
the An. dirus s.l. complex an exceptionally efficient vectors:
they are so long lived and highly anthropophilic that only
small populations are necessary to maintain high malaria
endemicity [81]. Their exophilic behaviour, early biting
habits and insecticide avoidance undermine the efficiency
of the most common vector control measures e.g. insecticide residual spraying and insecticide impregnated nets.
High human/vector contact in the typical forest biotope
inhabited by species of this complex can explain the
extended occurrence of what has been called "forest
malaria".

The forest activities of humans play a major role in the
malaria epidemiology of Southeast Asia [82]. The colonization of new land for agriculture, logging, mining and

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/6/1/26

other activities, as well as resettlement of populations in
the forest, expose people to high transmission risks in the
most favoured biotope of An. dirus s.l Overnight stays in
the open for hunting and collecting fruits in forest
increase the human/vector contact, and open temporary
shelters and forest huts facilitate early indoor biting when
people are not yet protected by bed-nets[40]. The invasion
of the jungle by human settlers most probably increases
the densities of these mosquitoes by providing hosts and
the small transitory pools that are preferred for oviposition [39]. During the dry season, people are mainly getting malaria in the deep forest [63] where infected vectors
[43] are commonly found all year round near permanent
streams [39]. Malaria attacks occur in villages only during
the rainy season, when An. dirus s.l. moves back to the valley and forest fringe and where secondary larval habitats
become available [59]. People move between villages and
semi-permanent huts in forest and migrations between
infected areas in the forest and non-infected areas trigger
the start of transmission in the forest fringe and its surroundings once conditions there become favourable.
The vector density peak occurs generally one month
before the malaria incidence peak [40]. However, large
populations of mosquitoes are, not required for maintaining a high level of transmission [1,29,61,71]. Hence,
small populations of mosquitoes might not be detected in
short-term surveys as abundance and presence vary greatly
between years, seasons and even from one week to
another. In some regions, females feed late at night and
may be missed unless night-long collections are made
[62]. The sporozoite rates of An. dirus s.l. vary with season
and location, with the highest rates recorded in October
(7.8%) at site 17 [75] and rates up to 14% in forested site
22 [41]. Rosenberg [81] found high variation between villages 800 m away from each other with a sporozoite rate
three to four times greater in the site of lower abundance.
Sporozoites of P.vivax and P.falciparum have been commonly detected in An. baimaii and An. dirus s.s Baimai [83]
reported sporozoites in An. scanloni and An. crascens with
slight differences between species in relation to the parasite. An. dirus s.s. developed Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum oocysts more readily than An. crascens and An.
scanloni. An. elegans, An. nemophilous, and An. takasagoensis
probably only transmit simian malaria [83].
Foci of chloroquine resistance have been commonly associated with An. dirus s.l. [1,2,70,84]. Wilkinson [85] carried out an experiment in a highly endemic area for
chloroquine resistant strains of P. falciparum and showed
that 66% of An. dirus s.l. and 44% of An. minimus became
infected when fed on the same infected patients. When
comparing the infected mosquitoes, the number of
oocysts was also higher in An. dirus s.l Trung [29] recorded
P.falciparum, P.vivax-210 and P.vivax-247 circumsporo-

zoite protein (CSP) in a single An. dirus s.l. mosquito. The
great longevity of An. dirus s.l., its high susceptibility to
Plasmodium infections and a tendency to develop high
numbers of oocysts increases the risk of recombining parasite strains in the mosquito gut and as consequence the
risk for a fast spread of multi-drug resistance.
Alternative methods to human landing collection should
be used where multi-drug resistance is present. CDC light
traps have been used successfully on other species in
Africa [86,87] and on An. dirus s.l. indoors in India [60]
but other studies show less positive results when comparing various trapping method to human landing collections [88,89]. Alternative methods to human landing
collection such as CDC light trap should be further evaluated as possible tool for monitoring vector control programmes.
An. dirus s.l. is susceptible to DDT [36,41,43,50] but due
to exophilic behaviour, females avoid treated walls
[43,52,63,90] or even avoid the sprayed huts by biting
more outdoors after residual spraying [59,91] and high
sporozoite rates may persist after application of DDT [2].
Insecticide impregnated bed-nets were proved to be effective [84] if kept in good condition [92], however, early biting habits in some areas exposes people to bites before
bed time. Insecticide-treated hammocks and personal
protection might thus be more effective. Alternative methods such as vegetation clearing are difficult to apply to
such diffuse temporary larval habitats[2]. Treating the vegetation surrounding houses to target resting females
would probably fail due to rapid loss of insecticide to rain
and rapid vegetation growth [62].

Conclusion
An. dirus s.s and A. bamaii of the An.dirus complex are certainly the most efficient malaria vectors in Asia. Human
activities in the jungle create high human/vector contact
exposing people with poor shelter conditions in forested
habitat, leading to perennial transmission. The efficiency
of these species, as malaria vectors is largely explained by
biological particularities. These species are highly susceptible to malaria parasites, there are highly anthropophilic,
and have an excellent survival rate required for the sporogonic cycle. These vectors are difficult to control regarding
the dispersion of temporary larval habitats in the forest,
and their exophilic behaviour by which the mosquitoes
entering the house will avoid any contact with indoor
insecticide treated surfaces. Their relative early biting
behaviour, preferably outdoors, may hamper the efficacy
of insecticide treated nets (ITN). However, as these vectors
are very sensitive to pyrethroids and almost exclusively
anthropophilic, scaling up of ITNs will probably affect
locally the An.dirus s.l. populations.

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/6/1/26

The distributions of species of the An. dirus complex have
been thoroughly analysed in Thailand, Malaysia and
recently in other areas of Southeast Asia following
extended surveys from the Malvecasia project, but the distributions of members of the complex in the western
region rely on few records and should be further investigated. Historical records and references from the literature
have been used to delimitate the maximum extent of the
complex distribution, but they do not reflect the current
situation as major changes in land-cover have occurred in
the region.
An. dirus s.l. is strongly associated with deep forest larval
habitats and probably also requires deep forest for adult
survival. It can survive year round wherever evergreen forest occurs. Drastic deforestation in recent decades has considerably reduced suitable habitats but adaptation of the
species to man-made habitats such as orchards and plantations greatly increases the human/vector contact and
suggests high plasticity in habitat requirements. However,
such adaptations might only occur in areas where some of
the environmental conditions, particularly micro-climatic
conditions (e.g. wells, orchards) are still suitable.
High heterogeneity in behaviour has been recorded for
mosquitoes of the An. dirus complex. The assumption that
the recent discovery of seven cryptic species would explain
most of this heterogeneity is challenged by the high
behavioural differences recorded for different populations
of the same species. An. baimaii specimens are developing
in wells or forest habitats. Biting peaks vary from early to
late within individual species and seasonality seems more
linked to environmental factors than to species distribution. This could be a consequence of incomplete characterization of the group due to imperfect identification
methods. Indeed, new molecular tools suggest the existence of two more species within the complex. Population
history and phylogenetic relationships between the species are not straightforward and are sometimes even contradictory [33,93]. Behavioural differences between
sibling species can only be analysed when they occur in
sympatry, and very few sympatric populations have been
studied. Allopatric species such as An. dirus s.s. and An.
crascens are impossible to compare.
Environmental factors play a major role in intraspecific
heterogeneity by interacting with the immature and adult
stages. The most important factors are rainfall, which provides larval habitats and keeps growth conditions optimal
by refreshing the sites and providing food, and the landcover with conditions being are optimal year-long in the
forest and seasonally in forest fringes. Temperature,
topography, soil type, salinity and drainage also have an
influence.

Environmental proxies might be relevant factors in a preliminary approach to establish approximate limits to the
possible extension in the flexible distribution range of An.
dirus s.l. However, variation in transmission dynamic
occurs at very small spatial and temporal scales and can
only be understood by studying micro-environmental
parameters in details and in relation to human factors
such as housing, settlement location in relation to the forest, occupations and migrations. This highlights the
importance of micro-environmental variations on mosquito populations in a region that is currently undergoing
major land-cover changes. Forest fragmentation and
changes in land occupation influence habitat suitability
for members of the complex. Although forest seems to be
essential for mosquito survival, adaptations to orchards
and wells have been recorded. Understanding the relationship between landscape components and mosquito
population is thus a priority in foreseeing the impact of
the land-cover changes on malaria occurrence and in
shaping control strategies for the future.
