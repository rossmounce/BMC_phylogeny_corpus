Abstract
Background: NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2 and CUC2) domain proteins are plant-specific transcriptional factors known to
play diverse roles in various plant developmental processes. NAC transcription factors comprise of a large gene
family represented by more than 100 members in Arabidopsis, rice and soybean etc. Recently, a preliminary
phylogenetic analysis was reported for NAC gene family from 11 plant species. However, no comprehensive study
incorporating phylogeny, chromosomal location, gene structure, conserved motifs, and expression profiling analysis
has been presented thus far for the model tree species Populus.
Results: In the present study, a comprehensive analysis of NAC gene family in Populus was performed. A total of
163 full-length NAC genes were identified in Populus, and they were phylogeneticly clustered into 18 distinct
subfamilies. The gene structure and motif compositions were considerably conserved among the subfamilies. The
distributions of 120 Populus NAC genes were non-random across the 19 linkage groups (LGs), and 87 genes (73%)
were preferentially retained duplicates that located in both duplicated regions. The majority of NACs showed
specific temporal and spatial expression patterns based on EST frequency and microarray data analyses. However,
the expression patterns of a majority of duplicate genes were partially redundant, suggesting the occurrence of
subfunctionalization during subsequent evolutionary process. Furthermore, quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR)
was performed to confirm the tissue-specific expression patterns of 25 NAC genes.
Conclusion: Based on the genomic organizations, we can conclude that segmental duplications contribute
significantly to the expansion of Populus NAC gene family. The comprehensive expression profiles analysis provides
first insights into the functional divergence among members in NAC gene family. In addition, the high divergence
rate of expression patterns after segmental duplications indicates that NAC genes in Populus are likewise to have
been retained by substantial subfunctionalization. Taken together, our results presented here would be helpful in
laying the foundation for functional characterization of NAC gene family and further gaining an understanding of
the structure-function relationship between these family members.

Background
Transcriptional regulation of gene expression controls
many important cellular processes in plants, such as cellular morphogenesis, signaling transduction and environmental stress responses [1]. Transcription factors
(TFs) are types of proteins that regulate gene expression
by binding to specific cis-acting promoter elements,
thereby activating or repressing the transcriptional rates

of their target genes [1,2]. Thus, the identification and
functional characterization of TFs is essential for the
reconstruction of transcriptional regulatory networks
[3]. In plants, totally more than 50 different families of
TFs have been identified based on bioinformatics analysis so far [1,3]. The Arabidopsis genome encodes at least
1550 TFs, accounting for about 6.2% of its estimated
total number of gene [4]. As for Populus, about 6.4% of
its genome was found to encode more than 2900 TFs
[3,5].

represented by ~105 genes in Arabidopsis [6], ~140
genes in rice [7] and ~101 genes in soybean genome [8].
NAC proteins commonly possess a conserved NAC
domain at the N-terminus, which comprises nearly 160
amino acid residues that are divided into five subdomains (A-E) [6,9,10]. A sequence region of 60 residues within the NAC domain contains a unique TF fold
consisting of a twisted-sheet bounded by a few helical
elements [11]. NAC domain has been implicated in
nuclear localization, DNA binding, and the formation of
homodimers or heterodimers with other NAC domain
proteins [11-16]. In contrast, the C-terminal regions of
NAC proteins are highly divergent [6-9,14], and confer
the regulation diversities of transcriptional activation
activity [11,13,15-22].
NAC proteins have been implicated to participate in a
wide range of plant developmental processes, including
shoot apical meristem development [10,23-26], floral
morphogenesis [27], lateral root development [15,28],
leaf senescence [29,30], stress inducible flowering induction [31,32], embryo development [11], cell cycle control
[33-35], hormone signaling [15,18,33,36], grain nutrient
remobilization [30,37] and shoot branching determination [38]. Particularly, numerous NAC domain proteins
have also been implicated in plant abiotic stresses and
defense responses such as drought, salinity, cold shock,
mechanical wounding and viral infection [18,20,28,
36,39-47]. Recently, accumulating evidences indicated
that a considerable portion of NAC domain proteins
also play crucial roles in the processes of xylogenesis,
fiber development, and wood formation in vascular
plants [17,19,21,48-55].
In Arabidopsis, evidences indicated that a subset of closely related NAC domain proteins including NST1/
ANAC043 (NAC Secondary Wall Thickening Promoting
Factor 1), NST2/ANAC066, and NST3/SND1(Secondary
Wall-associated NAC Domain Protein)/ANAC012 act as
master transcriptional switches governing secondary cell
wall biosynthesis in a partially redundant manner [52-55].
NST1/ANAC043 and NST2/ANAC066 were shown to
function redundantly in secondary cell wall thickening in
anther endothecium and induced ectopic secondary wall
thickenings in various tissues when expressed ectopically
[52,55], whereas NST1 and NST3/SND1/ANAC012
redundantly regulate the secondary wall thickening in
inter-fascicular fiber of inflorescence stems and secondary
xylem of hypocotyls in Arabidopsis [53,54]. SND2/
ANAC073 and SND3/ANAC010 have also been shown to
function in the formation of secondary cell wall in fibers,
and their dominant repression resulted in remarkable
reduction in the secondary wall thickening [51]. Interestingly, both of SND2 and SND3 seem to function at downstream of NST1 and NST3/SND1, whereas SND2 was
identified as a direct target of NST3/SND1 [51]. VND6

Page 2 of 23

and VND7 (Vascular-related NAC-Domain) have been
proposed to be regulators of the formation of vascular vessels in Arabidopsis [21,56]. They act as key transcriptional
switches regulating the differentiation of metaxylem and
protoxylem, respectively, in primary roots [21,56]. Consequently, NSTs may activate the secondary wall biosynthetic program in fibers, whereas VNDs are proposed to
specifically regulate secondary wall biosynthesis in vascular
vessels [51]. Another XND1/ANAC104 (Xylem NAC
Domain 1) gene has been revealed to influence the differentiation of tracheary elements and xylem development in
Arabidopsis by negatively regulating terminal secondary
wall biosynthesis and programmed cell death in xylem
vessel cells.
Although quite a few NAC TFs have been functionally
characterized in model plants Arabidopsis and rice, the
functions of majority of NAC members remain
unknown. Especially in Populus, the typical model tree
species, there are only very limited reports on the functional characterization of NAC TFs. Recently, Zhong et
al (2009) reported the molecular cloning and functional
characterization of six NAC genes in Populus [19].
Among the six NAC genes, WND2B (Wood-Associated
NAC Domain Transcription Factors) and WND6B effectively complemented the secondary wall defects in snd1/
nst1 double mutant, and when ectopically overexpressed in Arabidopsis, they induced ectopic deposition of secondary walls. These findings demonstrated
that WND2B and WND6B genes are functional orthologs of Arabidopsis SND1 and master switches activating
secondary wall biosynthesis during wood formation in
Populus [19]. Shen et al (2009) carried out a genomewide bioinformatics survey on plant NAC domain TFs
and identified a total of 1,232 NAC proteins from 11
different plant species including 148 NAC TFs from
Populus [57]. However, only sequence phylogeny analysis of Populus NAC TFs was performed in their report
and no detailed analysis including genome organization,
gene structure and expression compendium have been
conducted [57]. In the present study, we further performed a genome-wide identification of NAC domain
TFs in Populus and revealed an expanded NAC family
with totally 163 members. Detailed analysis including
sequence phylogeny, genome organization, gene structure, conserved motifs and expression profiling was performed. It is noteworthy that a subset of more than
thirty NAC genes showed the highest level of transcript
abundance in differentiating xylem and cambium tissues.
Among them, twenty-five genes were further investigated for their tissue-specific expressions by quantitative
real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis. Our results may
provide a subset of potential candidate NAC genes
for future engineering modification of lignocellulosic
biomass characteristics in Populus.

Results and Discussion
Identification of NAC gene family in Populus

The NAC domain genes are plant-specific TFs presented as one of the largest multigene families in Arabidopsis, rice, soybean, maize, grape and sorghum etc
[3,6,8,57]. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profile of the
Pfam NAC domain (PF02365) was exploited as query to
identify the NAC genes in Populus genome (release 2.0,
http://www.phytozome.net/poplar). Initially, a total of
170 nonredundant putative NAC genes were identified.
In an attempt to demonstrate the reliability of the identified genes, keyword search with NAM against NCBI
nucleotide database was performed, resulting in 153
members which were all included in the NACs identified above. In comparison to the NAC gene family in
PlnTFDB http://plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v3.0/[3] and
DPTF http://dptf.cbi.pku.edu.cn/[58], in which 167 and
172 members were proposed respectively, the 170 gene
loci revealed in the present study were roughly in agreement with the former. Then, the discrepancy loci identified in our studies with the two databases mentioned
above were further scrutinized to see if any misannotations were inferred. Among them, sixteen genes may
represent putative pseudogenes or incorrect annotations,
and manual reannotation was performed to correct and
reannotate the putative NACs using online web server
FGENESH http://linux1.softberry.com/berry.phtml[59].
In this endeavor, seven sequences encoding only truncated proteins were excluded from further analysis. In
addition, we combined the newly released genome annotations with the results inferred by FGENESH to make
the annotations more convincing. Finally, all the putative 163 NAC genes were further manually analyzed
using InterProScan program http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/
InterProScan/ to confirm the presence of NAM domain
[60]. In a recently published report, a total of 148 NAC
genes were identified in Populus by a genome-wide
bioinformatics survey [57]. In this study, we further
revealed an expanded NAC family in Populus with
totally 163 members. We designated Populus NAC
genes as PNAC following the nomenclature proposed in
the previous study [6]. The identified NAC genes in
Populus encode proteins ranging from 117 to 718 amino
acids (aa) in length with an average of 342 aa. Remarkably, in most cases, two or more Populus NAC genes
were found for every ortholog in Arabidopsis. The
detailed information of NAC family genes in Populus,
including accession numbers and similarities to their
Arabidopsis orthologs as well as nucleotide and protein
sequences was listed in Table 1 and Additional file 1.
The NAC gene family in Populus is by far the largest
one compared to the estimates for other plant species,
which range from ~105 in Arabidopsis [6], ~140 in rice

Page 3 of 23

[7] and ~101 in soybean [8]. The member of NAC
genes in Populus is roughly 1.58 fold than that of Arabidopsis, which is in consistency with the ratio of 1.4~1.6
putative Populus homologs for each Arabidopsis gene
based on comparative genomics studies [5]. In comparison to its closest woody perennial grape (Vitis vinifera),
which possesses only about 79 NAC genes [3], the NAC
genes in Populus seems to be highly expanded [5]. It
can be speculated that the presence of more NAC genes
in Populus genome may reflect the great needs for these
genes to involve in the complicated transcriptional regulations in this woody perennial species. This expansion
appears to be arisen from multiple gene duplication
events, including a whole-genome duplication event in
the Populus lineage followed by multiple segmental and
tandem duplication events [5].
Phylogenetic analysis of NAC gene family in Populus,
Arabidopsis and rice

To examine the phylogenetic relationship among the
NAC domain proteins in Populus, Arabidopsis and rice,
an unrooted tree was constructed from alignments of the
full-length NAC protein sequences (Figure 1). The phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA 4.0 by employing the Neighbor-Joining (NJ), Minimal Evolution (ME)
and Maximum Parsimony (MP) methods, respectively.
The tree topologies produced by the three algorithms
were largely comparable with only minor modifications
at interior branches (data not shown). Therefore, only
the NJ phylogenetic tree was subject to further analysis in
our study. Moreover, we constructed the phylogenetic
tree with the conserved N-terminal NAC domains A to E
using the same algorithm, which was largely consistent to
the phylogenetic analyses performed by the previous studies [57] (see details in Additional file 2). As indicated in
Figure 1, the phylogenetic tree divided the NAC family
proteins into 18 distinct subgroups. PNAC109 was distinguished from other NAC members and formed an individual clade with a robust bootstrap value support (99%)
(Figure 1 and Additional file 3). For simplicity, the subgroups were designated as alphabetical families (NAC-a
to NAC-r) based on tree topologies. Although the bootstrap values were somewhat low due to the large number
of sequences, which was also presented in previous studies [61-65], more significant bootstrap values in the distal branches allowed us to group the Populus,
Arabidopsis and rice NAC proteins into distinct families
(Additional file 3). Moreover, we sought other evidences
such as gene structure, motif compositions and expression patterns as described below to support the reliability
of the subgroup classification.
In general, the NAC members demonstrated an interspersed distribution in majority of subfamilies, indicating

Gene loci are from the Phytozome website http://www.phytozome.net/, release 2.0). A complete list of the coding sequences (CDS), deduced amino acid
sequences and genomic DNA sequences is available in Additional file 1.

Figure 1 Joined phylogenetic tree of NAC domain-containing proteins from Populus, Arabidopsis and rice. The deduced full-length
amino acid sequences of 163 Populus, 105 Arabidopsis and 140 rice NAC genes were aligned by Clustal X 1.83 and the phylogenetic tree was
constructed using MEGA 4.0 by the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Each NAC subfamily was indicated in a
specific color. Members of NAC protein from Populus were denoted in red.

Hu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:145
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/145

that the expansion of NAC genes occurred before the
divergence of Populus, Arabidopsis and rice. Noticeably,
NAC genes with same functions showed a tendency to
fall into one subgroup, similar to the previous reports
[7,8,57]. For instances, subfamily NAC-a encompassed
the NAC proteins involved in shoot organ boundary
delimitation (eg. CUC1, 2) [25,26], whereas subfamily
NAC-d possessed all the NAC proteins that function in
shoot apical meristem (SAM) establishment, pattern formation in embryos and flowers (eg. NAM) [11], stress
responses (eg. ATAF1, RD26 and OsNAC6) [18,47,66]
and leaf senescence (eg. NAP) [29]. This group also
encompassed ANAC019 and ANAC055, which have
been shown to be induced by abiotic stresses (ABA,
drought and salinity) and to enhance tolerance to
drought when ectopically over-expressed [40]. The
membrane-associated NAC proteins that mediate either
cytokinin signaling during cell division or endoplasmic
reticulum stress responses were clustered into the NACi and NAC-k subfamilies. The members in these two
subgroups are distinct with other NACs in that they
harbor a transmembrane (TM) motif with a predicted
a-helix in the far C-terminal region. In NAC-k subfamily, there were only two well functionally characterized
members namely NTM1 and NTM2. The well-characterized genes in subfamily NAC-f included FEZ, which
was demonstrated to be associated with the orientation
of cell division in root stem cells [34].
Remarkably, subfamily NAC-j did not include any
Arabidopsis and rice NAC proteins but only members
from Populus, suggesting that they may have been either
lost in Arabidopsis and rice or acquired in the Populus
lineages after divergence from the last common ancestor. We speculate that these subsets of genes may also
have specialized roles with respect to the woody perennial habit in Populus. Phylogenetic analysis also revealed
a subgroup NAC-o that contained sequence representatives in Populus and Arabidopsis but not in rice, indicating that the NAC members in this subgroup were
acquired or differentially retained in eudicots post-divergence from monocots. In contrast, the subgroup NAC-p
was composed of 13 rice NAC proteins, but no
Arabidopsis and Populus proteins, which suggests diversification and expansion of this subgroup after the
monocot-eudicot radiation.
The NAC proteins associated with secondary wall formation in fiber and vascular vessel development were
divided into three independent subfamilies. All NSTs
(NST1, NST2, NST3/SND1) and VNDs (VND1-VND7)
were clustered into one subfamily NAC-b, whereas
SND2, SND3 and their counterparts were grouped into
NAC-q. The other well-characterized NAC member
XND1 in secondary wall formation was assigned to
another different subfamily (NAC-e). All the six

Page 8 of 23

functional characterized NST3/SND1 orthologs
(PtWND1B to 6B) in Populus fell into subfamily NAC-b
[19]. Although enormous evidences exemplified that all
these NAC genes performed as key transcriptional
switches in the secondary cell wall formation process,
their exact functional roles diversified [52-55]. The phylogenetic analysis conducted herein may provide a
potential supporting for their functional diversities.
What’s more, the tissue-specific expression profiling
available on GENEVESTIGATOR lent further supports
for this notion [67]. The expression pattern of XND1 in
Arabidopsis was extremely different from that of NSTs
and VNDs. Nevertheless, the expression pattern of
SND2 and SND3 was somewhat more similar to that of
SND1/NST3 and NST2 (Additional file 4). In accordance with the recent report, NST, VND, SND, and
XND from 11 different species were also classified into
three distinct phylogenetic subgroups conducted by
Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithm [57]. Another
well-characterized gene namely SOMBRERO (SMB),
which has been shown to control the reorientation and
timing of cell division in root stem cells by negatively
regulating FEZ activity [34], was clustered together with
NSTs and VNDs into subfamily NAC-b. We inspected
the expression patterns of SMB on GENESTIGATOR
[67] but failed in an attempt to find any clues for their
diversified roles in secondary wall formation. SMB was
specifically highly expressed in callus and lateral root
cap rather than secondary cell wall enriching tissues,
suggesting a specific role in cell division and root development (Additional file 4).
It is noteworthy that the number of Populus genes was
generally overrepresented than that of Arabidopsis and
rice in almost all clades, especially within NAC-o subfamily, in which Populus NAC genes was particularly
overrepresented and almost sixfold the number of genes
with respect to Arabidopsis. Alternatively, in subfamily
NAC-a and q, the number of Arabidopsis and rice genes
nearly equaled that of Populus. In contrast, the number
of rice NAC genes in subfamily NAC-r showed an overwhelming predominance with respect to that of Populus.
The phylogenetic tree obtained in this study is largely
consistent with previous analyses [6-8,57], although
there are some discrepancies. The first systematic analysis of Arabidopsis and rice NAC proteins classified them
into 18 subgroups [6]. However, another phylogenetic
analysis of rice NAC proteins suggested that the NAC
family can be divided into five groups and each subfamily was largely diversified [7]. In a report concerning
soybean NAC family, the genes were clustered into 15
distinct subfamilies with robust bootstrap supporting
[8]. More recently, systematic phylogenetic analyses of
numerous NAC proteins from a wide range of plant
species indicated that NAC proteins can be divided into

Hu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:145
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/145

eight subfamilies [57]. In our opinions, the main reason
for the discrepancies of the phylogenetic trees reported
may lie in the fact that all the previous NAC protein
classifications were based on the conserved N-terminal
NAC domains, either from sub-domain A to D or A to
E, which did not take the highly divergent C-terminal
sequences into consideration [6-8,57]. In an attempt to
gain better understanding of the phylogeny of NAC
gene family, we performed the phylogenetic analysis
with inclusion of the highly diverse C-terminal
sequence. Moreover, different algorithms exploited in
the phylogenetic analyses may lead to the inconsistent
interpretations. In the previous analyses, different algorithms including Neighbor-Joining (NJ) [6,8], Maximum
likelihood (ML) [57] and Bayesian method [7] were
implemented, which may make the results less
comparable.
Inspection of the phylogenetic tree topology revealed
several pairs of NAC proteins with a high degree of
homology in the terminal nodes of each subfamily, suggesting that they are putative paralogous pairs (homologous genes within a species that diverged by gene
duplication) (Figure 1 and Additional file 3). Totally,
forty-nine pairs of putative paralogous NAC proteins
were identified, accounting for more than 60% of the
entire family, with sequence identities ranging from 71%
to 97% (see Additional file 5 for details).
Chromosomal location and gene duplication of Populus
NAC genes

In silico mapping of the gene loci showed that 163
Populus NAC genes were distributed across all 19 Linkage Groups (LG). In the currently released sequences,
totally 120 NAC genes were mapped to LGs, whereas 43
genes were remained on as yet unmapped scaffolds. The
distributions of Populus NAC genes across the LGs
appeared to be non-random (Figure 2). LG II encompassed the largest number of 12 NAC genes followed by
10 on LG V and LG I, respectively. In contrast, only one
NAC gene was found on LG XVIII and two NAC genes
were on LG XVII. Substantial clustering of Populus
NAC genes was evident on several LGs, especially on
those with high densities of NAC genes. For instances,
PNAC020, 022 and 030 were cluster localized on a 17
kb segment on LG XIV, and three NACs (PNAC033,
034 and 035) were organized in another cluster within a
10 kb fragment on LG II, whereas PNAC140, 141 and
143 were arranged in a cluster localized to a 11 kb segment on LG XII (Figure 2).
Previous studies revealed that Populus genome had
undergone at least three rounds of genome-wide duplications followed by multiple segmental duplication, tandem duplication, and transposition events such as
retroposition and replicative transposition [5,68].

Page 9 of 23

Among them, the segmental duplication associated with
the salicoid duplication event that occurred 65 million
years (Ma) ago significantly contribute to the amplification of many multi-gene families [61,69-71]. To determine the possible relationship between the NAC genes
and potential segmental duplications, we mapped Populus NACs to the duplicated blocks established in the
previous studies [5]. The distributions of NAC genes
relative to the corresponding duplicate genomic blocks
were illustrated in Figure 2. Within the 36 identified
duplicated blocks associated with the recent salicoid
duplication event, about 73% (87 of 120) of Populus
NACs were preferentially retained duplicates that locate
in both duplicated regions of 28 block pairs, whereas
nine block pairs only harbored NACs on one of the
blocks and lack the corresponding duplicates, suggesting
that dynamic changes may have occurred following segmental duplication, leading to loss of some of the genes.
In contrast, only a small number of 19 NAC genes were
located outside of any duplicated blocks.
In addition, the tandem duplications might also have
an impact on the expansion of the NAC gene family.
Fine mapping analysis revealed the presence of 13 pairs
of adjacent genes within a 20 kb distance possibly due
to tandem duplication either in inverse or same orientation (Figure 2). It is intriguing that except for one pair
(PNAC110 and 119), all the other putative tandem
duplicates were represented within the recent segmental
duplicate blocks. Similar results have also been reported
in several other Populus gene families [71,72]. These 26
NAC genes (16%) were represented in 12 distinct tandem duplicate gene clusters, with ten clusters containing
two tandem genes and two clusters possessing three
tandem genes. But further analysis of their similarities
demonstrated that most of the tandem clustered NAC
pairs shared relative low similarities (mostly below 50%),
which may exclude them from tandem duplicate candidates. Therefore, ultimately only six pairs of NACs were
conformed to the standards as tandem duplicates, which
were represented in tandem clusters of two to three
genes each. These tandem duplicated NAC genes were
organized onto duplicated blocks, implying that the
occurrence of local duplications was prior to the chromosomal segment duplication.
As a considerable proportion of the NAC proteins
appeared to be paralogous pairs as revealed in the phylogenetic analysis, we further investigated whether traceable genome duplication events have contributed to the
expansion of the NAC family. Nineteen out of 49 homologous pairs remained in conserved positions on segmental duplicated blocks (Figure 2), suggesting that
these genes may be the result of segmental duplication
event during the evolution. For 26 homologous pairs, no
traceable duplication events could be inferred, because

Figure 2 Chromosomal locations of Populus NAC genes. Only 120 NAC genes are mapped to the 19 Linkage Groups (LG), while the other 43
genes reside on unassembled scaffolds. The schematic diagram of genome-wide chromosome organization arisen from the salicoid genome
duplication event in Populus was adapted from Tuskan et al., (2006) [5]. Segmental duplicated homeologous blocks are indicated with the same
color. Only the duplicated regions containing NAC genes are connected with lines in shaded colors. Tandemly duplicated genes are indicated

they are mapped to the yet non-assembled scaffolds.
Among them, a total of 11 genes were located on segmental duplication blocks with their counterparts not
mapped to LGs yet. Meanwhile, a subset of eight NAC
genes were located outside of the segmental duplication
blocks while their corresponding members mapped to
non-assembled scaffolds. Taken together, nine genes of
the homologous pairs were definitely not located on any
duplicated blocks, and only three of them had the
homologous counterparts located on the duplicated
blocks. Duplicates of these genes appeared to have lost
from the Populus genome. Interestingly, one homologous pair PNAC121 and 122 was located on two divergent rather than homologous duplicated blocks, thus we
could not figure out any traceable duplication history

for this pair of NACs even though they were covered by
duplicated blocks.
Based primarily on the genomic organization of NAC
genes, we could conclude that segmental duplications
exclusively contributed to the complexity of NAC gene
family in the Populus genome. Similarly, segmental
duplications have also been shown to contribute to the
expansion of other gene families in Populus [61,70-72].
Our studies indicated that Populus NAC genes have
been preferentially retained at a rate of 73%, which is
much higher than the average rate following the salicoid
genome-wide duplication and rearrangement events [5].
On a genome-wide scale, approximately one third of
predicted genes are retained in duplications resulting
from the salicoid duplication event [5]. The high

Hu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:145
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/145

retention rate of duplicated genes was also previously
reported in other Populus gene families [70,71]. These
findings are also in consistency with the previous studies
demonstrating that genes involved in transcription regulation and signal transduction are preferentially retained
[73-75]. Another plausible explanation to the relatively
high retention rate of duplicate genes in NAC gene
family may lie in the fact that Populus genome has been
indicated to evolve at a much slower rate compared to
that of Arabidopsis [5]. The duplicated genes may
undergo divergent fates during subsequent evolution
such as nonfunctionalization (loss of original functions),
neofunctionalization (acquisition of novel functions), or
subfunctionalization (partition of original functions)
[76,77]. Whether the duplicated NAC genes correspond
to genetic redundancy or have evolved divergent functions remains to be further functionally characterized.
The tandem duplication ratio of NAC genes in this
study is relatively lower compared to some other gene
families in Populus, which was represented in a considerable higher proportion [71,72]. Interestingly, a similar
low retention rate of tandem duplicates was also
observed for Populus ARF gene family [71].
Gene structure and conserved motifs of Populus NAC
genes

It is well known that gene structural diversity is a possible mechanism for the evolution of multigene families.
In order to gain further insights into the structural
diversity of NAC genes, we compared the exon/intron
organization in the coding sequences of individual NAC
genes in Populus. A detailed illustration of the exon/
intron structures was shown in Figure 3B. In addition, a
separate phylogenetic tree was generated from complete
protein sequences of all the NAC genes in Populus,
which divided the NAC genes into ten subfamilies (Figure 3A). In general, most closely related members in
same subfamilies shared similar exon/intron structure in
terms of intron number and exon length (Figure 3B).
For instances, the NAC genes in subfamily I, III, IV and
VII contained two to three introns while those in subfamily IX all possessed no introns with exception of
PNAC079, which harbored one intron. In contrast, the
gene structure appeared to be more variable in subfamilies II and V, which had the largest number of exon/
intron structure variants with striking distinctions. Interestingly, although the exon/intron organization of NACs
varied significantly in terms of intron number, the
intron phase was remarkably high conserved (Additional
file 6), which was indicative of exon shuffling during the
evolution process [78].
We further analyzed the exon/intron structure of the
paralogous pairs in NAC gene family to obtain traceable
intron gain or loss information about these genes. Of

Page 11 of 23

the 49 paralogous pairs, thirty-four pairs showed conserved exon/intron structure either in terms of intron
numbers or gene length (Figure 3B). Remarkably,
twenty-five pairs of genes exhibited a highly conserved
distribution of exons and introns, with all members having three exons and two introns. Despite a majority of
these genes have arisen from segmental duplication
events, the others were located either on non-duplicated
blocks or on not-yet assembled scaffolds. While the
gene structure was conserved between some paralogous
pairs, others exhibited some extent of variation. For
example, eleven NAC genes out of the 49 paralogous
pairs possessed three exons in their coding regions,
whereas their homologous counterparts all contained
four exons within nearly identical gene lengths (Figure
3B). We could firmly speculate that the differences in
the last exons are probably derived from single intron
loss or gain occurred during the process of structural
evolution of NAC paralogs. The conserved exon/intron
architecture shared by these homologous gene pairs may
reciprocally lend supports for the results from the phylogenetic analysis and the duplication events.
To further reveal the diversification of NAC genes in
Populus, putative motifs were predicted by the program
MEME (Multiple Expectation Maximization for Motif
Elicitation), and 20 distinct motifs were identified. As
expected, most of the closely related members in the
phylogenetic tree had common motif compositions, suggesting functional similarities among the NAC proteins
within the same subfamily (Figure 3C). However, the
biological significance of most of the putative motifs
remains to be elucidated as they do not have homologs
when searching against Pfam and SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) databases [79,80]. The
details of the 20 putative motifs were referred in Additional file 7. As illustrated in the previous studies, most
of the NAC proteins possessed A to E subdomains in
the N termini that conferred the DNA-binding activities.
In this study, motif 2, 5, 1, 3 and 6 specifying the NAM
subdomain A to E respectively were present in most of
the NAC family members in Populus, whereas a small
subset of sequences did not have all five motifs in the
typical NAC DNA-binding domains. Even though the
C-terminal regions of NACs were highly divergent, we
could also identify at least eight conserved motifs using
the MEME motif search tool. Noticeably, some specific
motifs were present in NACs from specific subfamilies,
for instance, motif 16 for subfamily V, motif 9 for subfamily VIII and motif 11 for subfamily IX. Whether
these motifs confer unique functional roles to NACs
remains to be further investigated.
Of the 49 paralogous pairs, thirty-seven pairs of NACs
shared conserved motif composition with each other,
indicative of functional similarities. In contrast, specific

Hu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:145

motifs located in the C termini were observed for the
rest 12 pairs of NACs, for example, motif 13 for
PNAC041, 082, 113, 163, motif 14 for PNAC066, and
motif 19 for PNAC120. We attempt to speculate that
these specific motifs may by some extent attribute to
the subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization of the
duplicated genes during subsequent evolution processes.
The similar gene structures and conserved motifs of
NAC genes in same subfamilies may provide additional
supports to the phylogenetic analysis. On the other
hand, the differences between gene organization and the
divergences in motif compositions among different subfamilies may also indicate that Populus NACs are functionally diversified.
Differential expression profile of Populus NAC genes

Publicly available Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) was
considered as a useful means of studying gene expression profiles (digital northern) [81]. A scrutiny of the
frequency of ESTs in different databases allows preliminary analysis of gene expression under various conditions and across tissues. The digital expression profiles
of 81 Populus NAC genes were obtained from EST databases at NCBI (Oct., 2009), while the rest of other 82
NAC genes did not have corresponding EST sequences
in the database. Noticeably, the frequency of ESTs was
low with most of NACs represented by a single EST
sequence, which is consistent with the commonly low
transcript abundance feature of transcription factor
genes [61]. Thus we postulate that the absent genes in
EST database might either transcribe at relatively too
low abundance to be detected or had special temporal
and spatial expression patterns not examined in the
libraries. Another possible explanation is that these
genes might be pseudogenes, as they only possessed partial NAC domains as described previously (Figure 3C).
In order to gain a better portrait of NAC gene expression profiles, we further largely divided the EST data
into two groups, with one group contained all woodforming tissues and the other derived from the other tissues. The EST digital expression profiles were illustrated
in Figure 4, Figure 5 and Additional file 8. The expression profiles demonstrated that majority NACs have
rather broad expression patterns with presence in
diverse libraries. Not surprisingly, a considerable subset
of genes was preferentially expressed in leaves (Figure
4). In addition to leaves, more than 40% (36 of 81) of
the NAC genes were especially expressed during wood
formation (in cambial zone and xylem) (Figure 5).
It is noteworthy that several putative NAC orthologs
between Arabidopsis and Populus showed strikingly consistent expression patterns, which lend further supporting to the existence of functional conservation between
these two species. For example, the expression profiles

Page 13 of 23

of homologous pair PNAC031 and 032, which had two
corresponding ESTs derived from shoot meristem
respectively (Figure 4), further reinforced the notion
that they are the closest orthologs of NAM in Arabidopsis [11]. The EST data revealed that PNAC013 gene was
specifically expressed in active cambium with two
detectable ESTs and highly resembled the expression
pattern of its closest ortholog ANAC009 in Arabidopsis,
which was expressed predominantly in highly dividing
and expanding tissues such as callus and root cap
(Additional file 4).
Although the digital EST expression analyses provided
a first glimpse of the patterns of NAC expression in
Populus, we could not draw conclusive inferences
regarding NAC gene expression due to the obvious limitations of EST data such as relative narrow sample coverage and biases towards highly expressed genes. Thus,
we performed a more comprehensive microarray analyses for NAC gene expression profiles. To gain more
insight into the expression patterns of NAC genes, a
comprehensive expression analysis was further performed by utilizing the publicly available microarray
data for Populus. Firstly, we re-analyzed the collections
of microarray data from wood-formation series available
at PopGenIE, a database repository of transcriptomics
data available for Populus [82,83]. Distinct expression
profiles were identified for a total of 29 NAC genes (Figure 6 and Additional file 9), whereas no corresponding
probe sets were available for the remaining NACs in the
datasets. The relative low coverage of NACs in the datasets analyzed maybe partially due to the fact that these
arrays were mainly derived from ESTs rather than
offered a whole genome coverage [84].
Two subset of NAC genes exhibited specifically high
transcript accumulation in active and dormant cambiums respectively, from two independent microarray
datasets [85,86], strongly indicating their specific roles
in wood-formation (Figure 6A and 6B). In addition, by
incorporating the different microarray data, we were
capable to identify different subsets of NAC genes displaying specifically high expression levels in phloem, differentiating xylem and mature xylems, respectively. The
expression levels of five NAC genes including
PNAC070, 086, 121 and 122 were peaked exclusively in
differentiating xylems supported by two independent
microarray datasets (Figure 6C and 6G) [87,88]. Among
them, PNAC070 (PtWND5A), PNAC086 (PtWND1A)
and PNAC008 (PtWND3A) were demonstrated in previous studies as putative redundant homologs involved
in Populus wood formation [19]. Interestingly, several
genes such as PNAC013, 020 and 120 were preferentially expressed in tissues enriched of secondary cell
walls, whereas a subset of genes including PNAC028,
052, 055 and 023 showed constitutively high expressions

in both secondary and primary cell wall enriching tissues (Figure 6A-E). Similarly, several genes such as
PNAC118 and 136 displayed varied peak abundance of
transcript across the same tissues tested among different
microarray datasets (Figure 6A-E).
As the previous analyzed microarray are mainly
derived from ESTs and only a small fraction of NACs is
present in these datasets, we further seek to use microarray based on whole genome coverage to provide deep

insights into the expression patterns of NACs. We have
reanalyzed the Populus microarray data generated by
Wilkins and coworkers [61]. Only six NAC genes
(PNAC007, 018, 019, 052, 082 and 163) did not have
their corresponding probe sets in the dataset, and the
expression profiles of the rest of 157 NAC genes were
analyzed as indicated in Figure 7. The majority of NAC
genes showed distinct tissue-specific expression patterns
across the nine tissues examined (Figure 7 and

Hu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:145
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/145

Additional file 9). It is notably that a relatively large
fraction of NAC genes, accounting for more than 40%
(67 of 163), were preferentially expressed in male and
female catkins. Among these genes, thirty-four gene
(50%) showed the highest transcript abundances in male
catkins, twelve (18%) had the highest accumulation in
female catkins, and the remaining 21 (32%) showed
approximately equal transcript abundances in both male
and female catkins. The number of NAC genes fell into
this category is significantly higher compared to that of
MYB transcription factor gene family analyzed by the
same microarray data, in which, fifty (28%) R2R3-MYB
genes showed the highest transcript accumulation in
catkins [61]. The large proportion of NAC genes with
the highest transcript abundance in catkins may probably attribute to the unique characteristic of sex determination in Populus lineage. The previous phylogenetic
analysis revealed that these catkin-specific genes were
dispersed among different subfamilies rather than
divided into distinct subgroups (Figure 1).
Thirteen (8%) NAC genes showed the highest transcript
abundances in differentiating xylems, including four
xylem-specific NACs (PNAC070, 086, 121 and 122) identified in the previous microarray analysis (Figure 6C). The
six well-characterized NAC genes involved in the secondary cell wall thickening in the previous studies were all
included in this category [19]. The expression pattern of
PNAC008 gene was inconsistent with the above microarray analysis (Figure 6). The current data revealed the highest expression of PNAC008 gene in young leaves and
female catkins rather than in differentiating xylems. The
number of NAC genes with the highest transcript abundances in differentiating xylems seems to be a little bit
lower than that of R2R3 MYB gene family, which has 23
members accounting for about 12 percent of the total
[61]. In addition, a considerable fraction of 24 (15%) NAC
genes were specifically expressed in roots.
Interestingly, a subset of NAC genes demonstrated different expression patterns between dark-grown etiolated
seedlings and continuous light grown seedlings, suggesting that these NACs may be subject to photoperiodic
regulation. Strikingly, the majority of NAC genes did not
show seemingly high abundances of transcript in either
young or mature leaves as depicted by the previous ESTs
digital profiles analysis (Figure 4 and Additional file 7).
One possible explanation may lie in the fact of different
sample size and coverage exemplified in the analyses.
The high proportion of segmental duplication of NAC
genes and the preferential retention of duplicates raises
the question about their functional redundancy. Duplicate
genes may have different evolutionary fates: nonfunctionalization, neofunctionalization, or subfunctionalization [76],
which may be indicated with divergence in expression patterns. Of the 49 homologous pairs of NAC genes, six

Page 16 of 23

genes (PNAC007, 018, 019, 052, 082 and 163) did not
have corresponding probe sets on Affymetrix microarray
and were excluded for further analysis. Therefore, the
remaining 44 homologous pairs were analyzed. Among
them, nineteen pairs were located onto duplicated blocks
and three pairs were tandem duplicates. Five pairs
(PNAC004/006,
PNAC012/013,
PNAC084/085,
PNAC129/130 and PNAC144/145) out of 19 segmental
duplications shared the same expression patters with
respect to the tissues examined (Figure 7). In addition, the
expression pattern of homologous pair PNAC004/006 was
also supported by a broad sample sets from the previously
microarray and ESTs profiles (Figure 4). Although the
expression patterns of the rest of 14 duplicate genes were
partially redundant, distinct pattern shifts can be discerned, which suggested that they have undergone subfunctionalization. These findings indicated that expression
patterns of NACs have diverged quickly after segmental
duplications, thus the NAC genes in Populus are likely to
have been retained by substantial subfunctionalization. For
example, PNAC008 gene were mainly expressed in young
leaves and male catkins, whereas its duplicate counterpart
PNAC010 gene extended to a broader expression patterns
in young and mature leaves, female and male catkins (Figure 7).
Surprisingly, two homologous pairs (PNAC049/050
and PNAC121/122) also exhibited almost identical patterns of transcript accumulation but were located onto
different duplication blocks (Figure 7). The reasons
underlying their highly identical expression profiles
remain to be investigated since we could not draw any
clues from the segmental duplication events. The rest
ten homologous pairs also showed almost identical
expression patterns, but we could not locate them onto
duplicated blocks currently since some of them were
mapped to not-yet assembled scaffolds.
As for the tandem duplicated clusters with three
genes, the expression patterns of two of them
(PNAC020/022, PNAC033/035, PNAC141/143) were
almost identical, while significant diversification was
observed for the third member, which may indicate neofunctionalization. For example, tandem duplicate
PNAC020 and PNAC022 were predominantly expressed
in male catkins followed by roots, while PNAC030 was
largely expressed in root followed by female catkin (Figure 7). As for the tandem duplicated clusters with two
genes, their expression patterns diversified significantly,
indicative of substantial neofunctionalization during
subsequent evolution processes.

quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed on seven different tissues for 25 selected NAC
genes. As illustrated in Figure 8, the genes showed very
distinct tissue-specific expression patterns, which were
in good agreement with the above microarray and EST
profiles (Figure 6, 7). For example, in accordance with
previous findings, a subset of eight genes among the 25
NACs tested were exclusively expressed in differentiating xylem, indicative of their putative roles in secondary
cell wall formation. Three genes namely PNAC009
(PtWND4B), PNAC071 (PtWND1B) and PNAC085
(PtWND2B) have been functionally characterized in a
recent report [19]. In the present study, PNAC071 gene
was shown to primarily express in old root, while microarray profiles indicated the highest transcript abundance
in differentiating xylems (Figure 7). Seven genes showed

the highest transcript levels in phloem and four genes
had the most abundant transcripts in cortex, which
were both enriched in primary cell walls. These genes
may have putative roles in primary cell wall biosynthesis
and wood development. Consistent with the microarray
profiles, four genes (PNAC004, 006, 130 and 162) were
expressed specifically in leaves. Accordingly, PNAC004
gene had the largest number (up to 24) of corresponding EST sequences originated from leaves, which lent
further supports to the above statement. All the 25
genes tested have constitutively weak expression levels
in root meristem. Since only a few numbers of NAC
genes have been functionally characterized up to date,
our results presented here may provide some clues
for the selection of candidate genes for further
characterization.

Conclusion
In the present study, a comprehensive analysis including
phylogeny, chromosomal location, gene structure, conserved motifs, and expression profiling of NAC gene
family in Populus was performed. We identified a sum
of 163 full-length NAC genes in Populus genome, and
they were phylogeneticly clustered into 18 distinct subfamilies. The exon/intron structure and motif compositions of NACs were highly conserved in each subfamily,
indicative of their functional conservation. The NAC
genes were non-randomly distributed across 19 LGs,
and a high proportion of NACs were preferentially
retained duplicates located on the duplicated blocks,
which indicated that segmental duplications contribute
significantly to the expansion of Populus NAC gene
family. Although a majority of NAC genes showed specific temporal and spatial expression patterns based on
EST frequency and microarray data analyses, the expression patterns of a considerable proportion of duplicate
genes (14 of 44) were partially redundant, suggesting the
occurrence of subfunctionalization during evolutionary
process. In other words, a fraction of NAC genes in
Populus are likewise to have been retained by substantial
subfunctionalization. Furthermore, we identified a subset
of Populus NAC genes with putative functional roles in
wood-forming and secondary cell wall biosynthesis, and
results presented here will be helpful for future functional studies to unravel their divergent roles.

The P. trichocarpa genome sequences were downloaded
from Phytozome http://www.phytozome.net/poplar. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profile of NAC domain
(PF02365) downloaded from Protein family (Pfam)
http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/ was exploited for the identification of the NAC genes from Populus genome using
HMMER (v 2.3.2) [89]. All non-redundant hits with
expected values less than 1.0 were collected and then
compared with the NAC family in PlnTFDB http://
plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v3.0/[3] and DPTF http://
dptf.cbi.pku.edu.cn/[58]. As for the incorrectly predicted
genes, manual reannotation was performed using online
web server FGENESH http://linux1.softberry.com/berry.
phtml[59]. The reannotated sequences were further
manually analyzed to confirm the presence of NAM
domain using InterProScan program http://www.ebi.ac.
uk/Tools/InterProScan/[60]. Sequences of Arabidopsis
and rice NAC domain proteins were downloaded from
the Arabidopsis genome TAIR 9.0 release http://www.
Arabidopsis.org/ and rice genome annotation database (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/, release 5.0),
respectively.

Multiple sequence alignments of the full-length protein
sequences, including the highly conserved N-terminal
NAM domain and the more divergent C-terminal activation domain, were performed by Clustal X (version
1.83) program [90]. The unrooted phylogenetic trees
were constructed with MEGA 4.0 using the NeighborJoining (NJ), Minimal Evolution (ME) and Maximum
Parsimony (MP) methods and the bootstrap test carried
out with 1000 iterations [91]. Pairwise gap deletion
mode was used to ensure that the more divergent
C-terminal domains could contribute to the topology
of the NJ tree.
Genomic structure and chromosomal location

Gene structure display server (GSDS) program [92] was
used to illustrate exon/intron organization for individual
NAC genes by comparison of the cDNAs with their corresponding genomic DNA sequences from Phytozome
http://www.phytozome.net/poplar. Identification of
homeologous chromosome segments resulting from
whole-genome duplication events was accomplished as
described in Tuskan et al. (2006) [5]. Blocks of the same
color represent the homologous chromosome segments.
The tandem gene duplications in Populus were identified
according to the same criteria described in rice [93].
Genes separated by five or fewer gene loci in a range of
100 kb distance were considered to be tandem duplicates.

EST profiling and microarray analysis

A total of 429,444 Populus EST sequences were downloaded from the GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/est/, release 121009). The coding regions of
NAC genes were used as queries to perform a local
BLASTN search against all of the ESTs. Matches above
96% identity and over an alignment of at least 100 bp
were considered as corresponding sequences of the NAC
genes. The entries identified were manually inspected for
their tissue origin. In addition, the DigitalNorthen tool at
the PopGenIE http://www.popgenie.org/ was utilized to
produce the heat map with dendrograms of the NAC
genes with their corresponding gene model IDs.

Populus microarray data were obtained from PopGenIE ftp://aspnas.fysbot.umu.se/, the expression data
were gene-wise normalized and hierarchical clustered
based on Pearson coefficients with average linkage in
the Genesis (version 1.75) program [97].
The genome-wide microarray data performed by
Wilkins and coworkers [61] were obtained from the
NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [98] with accession number GSE13990. Probe sets corresponding to the
putative Populus NACs were identified using an online
Probe Match tool available at the NetAffx Analysis Center http://www.affymetrix.com/. For genes with more
than one probe sets, the median of expression values
were considered. When several genes have the same
probe set, then they are considered to have same level
of transcript abundance. the expression data were genewise normalized and hierarchical clustered based on
Pearson coefficients with average linkage in the Genesis
(version 1.75) program [97].
Plant material and growth conditions

One-year-old Populus deltoides was grown in the greenhouse under long day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark) at
a temperature 25°C~28°C. Shoot apices (internodes 1~3
from top, same as below), leaf (from internodes 4~6),
developing xylem (from the basal internodes), phloem
(from the basal internodes), cortex (from the basal internodes), old root and root tip (terminal 3~5 mm) tissues
were separately harvested. All samples were immediately
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until
required.
RNA isolation and quantitative real-time RT-PCR
(RT-qPCR)

Total RNA from the majority of the samples was
extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Ca, USA)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Alternatively,
total RNA from cortex, old root and root tip were isolated by CTAB method [99] with minor modifications.
RNA integrity was verified by 2% agar gel electrophoresis and SYBR Greenlstaining. Before cDNA synthesis,
RNA was treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions to ensure no DNA contamination,
and then the first-strand cDNA synthesis was carried
out with approximately 2 μg RNA using the RevertAid
First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (MBI, Fermentas) and
oilgo-dT primers according to the manufacturer’s procedure. Primers were designed using Beacon Designer v7.0
(Premier Biosoft International, Palo Alto, California,
USA) with melting temperatures 58~60°C, primer
lengths 20~24bp and amplicon lengths 51~199bp.
Experimental details are given in additional file 10.

RT-qPCR was conducted on LightCycler® 480 Detection System (Roche, Penzberg, Germany) using SYBR
Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa, Toyoto, Japan). Reactions were
prepared in a total volume of 20 μl containing: 2 μl of
template, 10 μl of 2×SYBR Premix, 0.4 μl of each specific primer to a final concentration of 200 nM. The reactions were performed as the following conditions: initial
denaturation step of 95°C for 10 s followed by two-step
thermal cycling profile of denaturation at 95°C for 5 s,
and combined primer annealing/extension at 60°C for 1
min for 40 cycles. No-template controls were included
for each primer pair and each PCR reaction was completed in triplicate. To verify the specificity of the amplicon for each primer pair, a melting curve analysis was
performed ranging from 60°C to 95°C with temperature
increasing steps of 0.06°C/s (5 acquisitions per °C) at
the end of each PCR run. Baseline and threshold cycles
(Ct) were automatically determined using the LightCycler® 480 Software release 1.5.0. Relative gene expression
with respect to internal reference gene UBQ10 was
determined as described previously [100].
