Abstract
Background: Low copy repeats (LCRs) are thought to play an important role in recent gene
evolution, especially when they facilitate gene duplications. Duplicate genes are fundamental to
adaptive evolution, providing substrates for the development of new or shared gene functions.
Moreover, silencing of duplicate genes can have an indirect effect on adaptive evolution by causing
genomic relocation of functional genes. These changes are theorized to have been a major factor
in speciation.
Results: Here we present a novel example showing functional gene relocation within a LCR. We
characterize the genomic structure and gene content of eight related LCRs on human
Chromosomes 7 and 12. Two members of a novel transmembrane gene family, DPY19L, were
identified in these regions, along with six transcribed pseudogenes. One of these genes, DPY19L2,
is found on Chromosome 12 and is not syntenic with its mouse orthologue. Instead, the human
locus syntenic to mouse Dpy19l2 contains a pseudogene, DPY19L2P1. This indicates that the
ancestral copy of this gene has been silenced, while the descendant copy has remained active. Thus,
the functional copy of this gene has been relocated to a new genomic locus. We then describe the
expansion and evolution of the DPY19L gene family from a single gene found in invertebrate animals.
Ancient duplications have led to multiple homologues in different lineages, with three in fish, frogs
and birds and four in mammals.
Conclusion: Our results show that the DPY19L family has expanded throughout the vertebrate
lineage and has undergone recent primate-specific evolution within LCRs.

Background
Gene duplication is an important factor in evolution.
These duplications can arise during the expansion of low
copy repeats (LCRs), or segmental duplications, which
make up a significant proportion of the human genome
sequence [1,2]. The high sequence identity (>90% over >5
kb) shared between these DNA segments indicates that
they have arisen over the past 35 million years (MY) of

primate evolution and in some instances are human specific. Detailed analyses of LCRs in humans have shown
that these repeats are often interspersed, rather than tandemly duplicated [1,3]. LCRs are observed both interchromosomally, with enrichment in pericentromeric and
subtelomeric chromosomal regions [4], and intrachromosomally, with enrichment in euchromatic sequences.

LCRs have important consequences in vertebrate gene
evolution. Traditionally, the major force in genome evolution was thought to be nucleotide substitutions. However, gene duplications have been shown to significantly
contribute to evolution by acting as molecular substrates
for divergence [5,6]. In fact, the estimated rate of duplicate
gene fixation (1/gene/100 MY) [7-9] is similar to or
greater than the estimated nucleotide substitution rate at
silent sites (0.1–0.5/site/100 MY) [10]. Duplicate genes
arise by several different mechanisms: unequal crossing
over and retroposition, which give rise to small duplications, and chromosomal duplication and whole genome
polyploidization, which involve much larger amounts of
DNA [11]. Considering that the last whole genome polyploidization event in the land vertebrate lineage is estimated to have occurred more than 600 MY ago [12],
duplications of this nature are not expected to play a role
in primate speciation. Instead, smaller duplications, such
as those creating LCRs, which maintain gene structure and
organization, are predicted to have significantly affected
recent primate evolution. This theory is supported by the
finding that segmental duplications make up a significant
proportion of primate genomes, with estimates of around
5% in the human genome [1,2,4]. Although the LCR composition of mammalian genomes has been recently examined, an in-depth investigation of the gene content in
LCRs and their role in gene evolution has not been undertaken.
Studies have shown an unexpectedly large complement of
functional gene duplicates in most genomes [13,14],
which can be accounted for by two of the fates for duplicated genes. One of these fates, subfunctionalization,
occurs when both copies of a gene degenerate in a complementary fashion, such that both copies are required to
perform the ancestral functions [15,16]. The other fate is
neofunctionalization, in which positive selection for beneficial mutations occurs, allowing one of the gene copies
to diverge rapidly and adopt a new function [17]. Subfunctionalization is predicted to develop more frequently
than neofunctionalization because it exploits common
degenerative mutations rather than relying on rare beneficial mutations.
The third and most common fate for copies of a gene following duplication and fixation is for one of the copies to
become nonfunctional through the accumulation of deleterious mutations. These mutations are tolerated when
duplicate genes are functionally redundant, relaxing the
selection on at least one of the two copies. In humans, it
is estimated that duplicate genes have an average half life
of 7.5 MY [8]. After a copy is silenced, a nonfunctional
remnant will exist until it is deleted or mutated beyond
recognition. These remnants are known as pseudogenes.
Pseudogenes can also be created by partial duplications

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/45

that exclude key sequences or regulatory regions of genes.
Several recent studies have evaluated the pseudogene content in the human genome [18,19] and have found that
their number may equal or even surpass the number of
functional genes.
Although pseudogenization restores the proteome to its
pre-duplication state, it may passively affect adaptive evolution. Since selection is often relaxed on both copies of
the gene after duplication, either the ancestral or the progeny copy can be inactivated. Pseudogenization of the
ancestral copy constitutes gene relocation. Much like
larger rearrangements, relocation of unique genes to different chromosomes can contribute to reproductive isolation and speciation [20].
Here we describe the relocation of the gene DPY19L2
within a set of LCRs (Fig. 1). Although this type of genome
modification has been hypothesized [20], very few examples of this type of relocation have been documented
[21,22]. We demonstrate the relocation of a functional
gene through its duplication and subsequent pseudogenization within a LCR. Additionally, we characterize
another functional gene, DPY19L1, and six pseudogenes
within these LCRs. Both of these functional genes belong
to a novel transmembrane gene family, DPY19L, containing four human genes, which has undergone both ancient
and recent duplications. This paper investigates the evolution of these novel transcripts and describes the LCRs that
are associated with the recent gene duplications and relocation.

Results
Physical organization of the low copy repeats
A large duplication of sequence between 7p14.3 and
7p15.1 was identified during the annotation of human
Chromosome 7 [23]. Blastn [24] searches against the nr
database using these two regions as query sequences identified six additional loci containing large stretches of
duplicated DNA. In total, eight regions were identified
with >90% identity over >5 kb and were designated
LCR7A through LCR7H based on their sizes. Seven of
these regions are located on Chromosome 7, five on the p
arm and two on the q arm, while one region is located on
the q arm of Chromosome 12 (Fig. 2A; see Additional file
1).

To define the duplication boundaries and determine their
structures, two programs, Blast 2 sequences [25] and
mVISTA [26-28] were utilized. For these analyses, the
sequences of the LCRs on Chromosome 7 were obtained
from the Chromosome 7 annotation project sequence
(CRA_TCAGchr7.v2) while the sequence on Chromosome 12 was acquired from NCBI's public Build 35 (see
Additional file 1). Using the two programs we were able

Schematic illustration of the creation and relocation of the functional DPY19L2 gene. Ancient duplication of
DPY19L1 prior to mammalian divergence created a duplicate copy of the gene. The ancestral locus of DPY19L2 is defined by
ascertaining the gene's location in non-primate mammals. Consistently, the gene is found adjacent to DPY19L1 in a region syntenic to human Chromosome 7, suggesting the ancient duplication was in tandem. Recent inter-chromosomal duplication (grey
box surrounding DPY19L2) occurred creating a second copy of DPY19L2 within a region syntenic to human Chromosome 12.
Sequence evolution introduced two STOP codons (asterisks above white bars) into the ancestral gene, leading to its pseudogenization (cross-hatching indicates pseudogene). Thus, functional DPY19L2 has been relocated from its ancestral location on
Chromosome 7 to a descendant region on Chromosome 12 within a recent LCR.

to determine the size and sequence content of the LCRs
(see Additional file 2). We were also able to resolve the
complex modular structure of the duplications, tracing
much of the duplicated DNA back to LCR7A by a best
match analysis (Fig. 2B). Overall, the eight LCRs comprise
more than 1 Mb of duplicated DNA with sequence identities ranging from 94–98% (see Additional file 2).

Identification of transcripts in low copy repeats
We inspected the eight regions for known transcripts that
had been duplicated during the expansion of the LCRs.
We initially examined LCR7A, since it was the largest of
the examined LCRs, and found two known transcripts
(Fig. 3A, 3B). We confirmed their transcription and identified upstream exons by RT-PCR and 5' RACE on human

Structures of the transcripts found within the set of LCRs. Genes (labeled in black) and their pseudogenes (labeled in
dark grey) are shown in relation to each other. Exons that are duplicated between transcripts are shown in red, while exons
unique to a transcript are shown in black (genes) or dark grey (pseudogenes). Light grey boxes around exons represent regions
of the transcripts, including introns, that have been duplicated. Open reading frames of the two functional genes are indicated
by black bars under the transcripts. Repetitive elements contained within exons are shown in black below the transcripts.
Intron sizes of all transcripts are based on the introns of the functional genes A) DPY19L1 and its two pseudogenes; B) DPY19L2
and its four pseudogenes. Dotted line in exon 3 of DPY19L2P4 represents continuity between the two parts of the exon.

functions that do not require the complete CDS, such as
those undergoing neo- or subfunctionalization. Transcripts with complete ORFs were classified as genes.
Although the function of AB020684 is unknown, in silico
analysis indicated that it encodes a protein with homology to the C. elegans protein DPY-19 (see Additional files
3 and 4). Therefore, we called this gene DPY19L1 (Fig.
3A). Ten exons from this gene (exons 4 to 13) appear to
be duplicated in a known transcript within LCR7B [Genbank:AK026768]. Along with these ten exons, AK026768
has an additional two upstream and five downstream
exons that fall outside the duplicated sequence, giving it a
total of 17 exons. However, unlike DPY19L1, this transcript does not appear to encode a complete ORF because

it has STOP codons in exons 2 and 11. This transcript,
which we named DPY19L1P1 (Fig. 3A), was classified as a
pseudogene. We defined a pseudogene as a duplicated
transcript that has lost its original function due to incomplete duplication or at least one interruption of the ORF.
The second transcript from LCR7A [Genbank:BC066987]
also has 22 exons. This transcript does not have a complete ORF because it has STOP codons in exons 6 and 7.
Duplications of all 22 exons of this transcript were seen in
two other regions: LCR7C and LCR7D. The transcript in
LCR7C [Genbank:AL833344] is a gene because it has a
complete ORF coding for 758 amino acids. In silico analysis of this ORF again showed homology to the C. elegans

gene DPY-19, although with a lower percent identity
(38% amino acid identity, compared with 43% identity
for DPY19L1) (see Additional files 3 and 4). Therefore, we
named this gene DPY19L2 (Fig. 3B). Like the second transcript on LCR7A, the transcript on LCR7D [Genbank:AL834175] has inframe STOP codons, caused by
insertions of LTR repeats in exon 3. These inactivated transcripts on LCR7A and LCR7D are classified as pseudogenes, and we named them DPY19L2P1 and DPY19L2P2
respectively (Fig. 3B).
The two genes and three pseudogenes make up a set of
duplicated known transcripts within the eight LCRs. To
identify novel transcripts that belong within this set, we
used the two coding genes as queries for UCSC BLAT
searches [29] against the human genome Build 35
sequence. Using sequence identity to uncharacterized
mRNA and EST transcripts, we were able to identify three
additional pseudogenes that arose from partial duplications. One transcript in LCR7B, DPY19L1P2, shows high
identity with DPY19L1, while two other transcripts,
DPY19L2P3 in LCR7E and DPY19L2P4 in LCR7F, share
high identity with DPY19L2 (Fig. 3A, 3B). The relationships between these transcripts are illustrated by an analysis of their phylogeny (see Additional file 5).
Genomic relocation of DPY19L2
Although both DPY19L1 and DPY19L2 share homology
to the C. elegans gene DPY-19 and are within a set of
related LCRs, these two genes are not recent duplicates of
each other. We reached this conclusion because the region
of LCR7A that contains DPY19L1 does not show high
sequence identity with the region of LCR7C that contains
DPY19L2 (Fig. 2B). Instead, we attribute their similarity to
an ancient duplication that occurred prior to mammalian
divergence. This is supported by two observations: the
percent nucleotide identity between the two transcripts is
~76% (less than the 90% cutoff typically used for recent
duplications [1,2]; see Additional file 3) and both genes
are also present in mouse. The two mouse genes, Dpy19l1
and Dpy19l2, share ~72% nucleotide sequence identity
with each other and are ~54.3 kb apart on mouse Chromosome 9 in a region syntenic to LCR7A on human Chromosome 7p14.3 (Fig. 1). Importantly, Blastn analysis
indicates that these two genes, and their genomic regions,
are unique in the mouse genome and do not appear to
have been recently duplicated within LCRs. Notably, the
functional Dpy19l2 is syntenic to the human pseudogene
DPY19L2P1, not to the functional DPY19L2 on Chromosome 12. This indicates that the ancestral copy of
DPY19L2 was present on Chromosome 7 (Fig. 1). This is
confirmed by our analysis of the genes in dog and rat. Segmental duplication of this region onto Chromosome
12q14.2 established two copies of the functional gene.
Initial functional redundancy relaxed the selection on one

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/45

or both of the copies of this gene, allowing the fixation of
an inactivating pseudogenization event. In this case, the
ancestral copy on 7p14.3 was pseudogenized while the
copy on 12q14.2 remained functional. Thus, DPY19L2
has undergone gene relocation within a recent LCR (Fig.
1).
Neutral evolution of recently duplicated transcripts
We analyzed the three known pseudogenes within the
LCRs, each of which contains a substantial duplication of
the original ORF. We hypothesized that if these transcripts
are no longer functional, their sequences would not be
under selectional constraint. Hence, they would be evolving neutrally. We looked for evidence of selection by two
methods, codon position bias of nucleotide changes and
Ka/Ks; each assumes nucleotide changes accumulate
evenly in the three codon positions during neutral evolution. As it is possible that truncation following duplication can result in a new gene, with purifying selection 5'
and neutral evolution 3' of the new STOP codon, we
selected the largest ORF in each of the pseudogenes for
this analysis. In each case, the largest ORF observed corresponded to a truncation of the original ORF, rather than a
frameshift.

Our first analysis looks at the distributions of nucleotide
changes between the functional genes and the inactive
transcripts and then compares them to the distributions of
changes between the functional genes in human and
mouse. In this analysis, the nucleotide changes in the largest ORF of the inactive transcripts are more equally distributed than the changes between the human and mouse
functional genes (Table 1). As expected, the changes
between the two functional genes are in a 3rd>1st>2nd
codon position distribution, which is indicative of purifying selection.
Distributions of nucleotide changes affect the synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka) substitution rates.
In purifying selection, we expect the synonymous rate to
be much higher than the non-synonymous rates (Ka/
Ks<1), whereas in neutral selection the rates are expected
to be very similar. Much like the first analysis, we see that
the substitution rate between the functional human and
mouse genes suggests purifying selection, while the Ka/Ks
values within the inactive genes' ORFs are much higher
(Table 1). Most likely, this increase in Ka/Ks indicates
relaxed or neutral selection of the pseudogenes.
DPY19-like gene family
Along with DPY19L1 and DPY19L2, homology searches
identified two other human genes that have amino acid
identity to the C. elegans gene DPY-19 (see Additional files
3 and 4). These two genes, DPY19L3 and DPY19L4, are
located on Chromosomes 19q13.11 and 8q22.1, respec-

tively, and do not reside in any segmental duplications.
Both of these transcripts are known genes spanning 18
exons and are covered by full-length mRNA transcripts
([Genbank:AK126757], encoding 716 amino acids, and
[Genbank:AK123682], encoding 723 amino acids, respectively). Similar to DPY19L1 and DPY19L2, the functions
of these genes are uncharacterized.
RT-PCR analysis of these homologous genes shows similar ubiquitous expression in all tissues examined (Fig.
4A). However, although the pattern of expression is
highly similar between DPY19L1, DPY19L3, and
DPY19L4, there appears to be some slight variations in the
expression of DPY19L2. The majority of these differences
can be attributed to the concomitant amplification of two
pseudogenes, DPY19L2P1 and DPY19L2P2. These two
pseudogenes share such high identity with the functional
gene that we were unable to specifically amplify DPY19L2.
By sequencing the bands from the RT-PCR experiment, we
were able to determine the expression of DPY19L2 and the
two pseudogenes by analyzing transcript specific paralogous sequence variants. DPY19L2 appears to be expressed
to some degree in all tissues, while DPY19L2P1 is
expressed in the brain, heart, placenta and testis and
DPY19L2P2 is expressed in the fibroblast, lung, lymphoblast, spleen and testis. Superfluous pseudogene amplification can account for the increase in expression seen in
certain tissues. However, other tissues, such as liver, skeletal muscle, spleen and small intestine, are shown to have
significantly lower expression in DPY19L2 (Fig. 4A). This
might indicate some differences in DPY19L2 gene regulation.
We used NCBI's BLAST [24] and UCSC's BLAT [29] tools
to identify proteins homologous to DPY-19 in other animals (see Methods). These protein sequences were then
aligned using ClustalW [30]. With the multiple alignment
file, a neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA3 [31] (Fig. 4B). As a test of inferred
phylogeny, bootstrap values were calculated using 250
replications. From this analysis we can see that invertebrate animals such as nematodes (C. elegans) and deuter-

ostomes (C. intestinalis) have a single DPY-19 gene, while
all vertebrates examined have at least three homologous
copies. This suggests that multiple duplications have
occurred during vertebrate evolution. The first duplications appear to have occurred prior to the divergence of
the fish lineage, giving rise to two additional copies,
DPY19L3 and DPY19L4, which are present in all vertebrates. An additional duplication, generating DPY19L2,
appears to have arisen prior to mammalian divergence.
This gene appears in all mammals examined, including
the metatherian opossum (M. domestica). However, it is
unclear whether this duplication occurred before or after
the divergence of chicken. Although chicken is lacking
DPY19L2, one of its proteins is placed in the DPY19L1
clade (with a relatively high bootstrap value of 77%)
rather than grouping with the DPY-19 proteins. This
could indicate that the duplication leading to DPY19L2
has occurred before chicken divergence with subsequent
gene loss in chicken (or the second copy may not be represented in the genome sequences available for the
chicken due to the incomplete nature of its genome
assembly). Alternatively, the duplication could have
occurred after chicken divergence, with the chicken protein maintaining more similarity to DPY19L1 due to an
accelerated evolution of DPY19L2 relative to DPY19L1
(longer branch lengths of DPY19L2 proteins are seen in
Fig. 4B). Through these observations, we estimate that the
duplication that generated DPY19L2 arose between 173
(Marsupilia) and 360 (Lissamphibia) MYA (based on divergence times in [32]). Additional trees were built using different phylogenetic methods (including minimum
evolution and maximum parsimony) to confirm the
observed phylogeny. Overall, these trees had a highly similar topology to the tree presented in Fig. 4B (data not
shown).
Structure and conservation of DPY-19 homologs
DPY-19 is a novel transmembrane protein that is required
for the proper polarization and migration of neuroblasts
in C. elegans. It has been shown to express weakly in the
QL and QR neuroblasts, their neighbouring epidermal
cells, and in dorsal and ventral body muscle cells [33]. To

Comparison of DPY19L family members. A) RT-PCR analysis of the four human genes. B) Phylogenetic analysis of DPY19L
gene family evolution in multiple animal species. An alignment of 42 protein sequences was created in ClustalW and input into
MEGA3. The neighbour-joining tree was created using the Jones-Taylor-Thornton matrix for amino acid evolution and bootstrap values, calculated from 250 replications, are shown at internal nodes. Proteins are labeled by species and grouped into
families (defined by brackets with family name on the right).

ensure that the four human homologues have similar
structures to this gene, we compared their domain architectures using SMART [34] and Pfam [35]. DPY-19 does
not have any predicted SMART or Pfam domains, but does
have 10 predicted transmembrane domains, consistent
with its characterization as a transmembrane protein.
Similarly, the four human homologues have 9 to 11 predicted transmembrane domains, which suggest that they
share a similar protein structure with DPY-19.
Using the multiple species amino acid alignment, we were
able to identify putative motifs with high conservation
using the program MEME [36]. Three putative motifs,
each at least 50 amino acids in width and present in at
least 40 of the 42 proteins, were identified by this program. All three putative domains are significantly more
conserved at the amino acid level than the rest of the proteins (P-value < 0.0001; See Methods). However, two of
these motifs contained one or more transmembrane
domains in a subset of the proteins. Therefore, the conservation in these two regions is most likely due to the presence of a transmembrane domain. The third motif, which
was the largest and most significant motif identified by
MEME, does not match any known domains. This motif is
present near the C-termini of the proteins and may represent a novel functionally relevant sequence (see Additional file 6).

Discussion
Low copy repeats in extant genomes represent the most
recent duplications of large stretches of DNA. In humans,
sequence and cytogenetic data indicate that the commonly used thresholds are detecting LCRs that have arisen
within the past 35 MY of primate evolution [1,2,37].
These active, and not uncommon, restructurings within
genomes have important implications in molecular evolution. Genes duplicated within LCRs can diverge through
substitutions or exon shuffling [38,39], allowing, in rare
circumstances, novel functions to develop. Also, because
of their high nucleotide sequence identity, copies of LCRs
can act as substrates for large rearrangements, such as
deletions, inversions and duplications (reviewed in [40]).
Such large rearrangements are often found to cause
genomic disorders, while less severe changes are theorized
to be significant factors in genome evolution and speciation.
In this paper, we demonstrate that LCRs can also have a
more subtle effect on genome evolution. We first characterize a set of LCRs on human Chromosomes 7 and 12.
These LCRs have a complex modular structure with
sequence identities ranging from 94–98% (Figure 2B; see
Additional file 2). The exact order of the LCR expansion is
difficult to ascertain due to this complexity, as well as the
similarity in sequence identity between the regions. Even

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/45

the branching order of the transcripts contained within
the LCRs is not easily resolved due to their high sequence
similarity (see Additional file 5). After the characterization
of these regions and their transcripts, we then describe a
novel example of functional gene relocation through
duplication and subsequent pseudogenization within a
LCR (Fig. 1). This is a type of small chromosomal rearrangement that has been implicated in evolution, and has
been suggested to be involved in speciation events
through population isolation followed by divergent resolution of duplicate genes [20,41]. Gene silencing has also
been shown to relocate functional genes following whole
genome duplication [21] or subtelomeric duplication
[22] events. The example we report is the first characterization of functional gene relocation within a euchromatic
LCR. We propose that, like rearrangements of DNA segments and gene structures, rearrangements in gene order
during LCR creation and expansion are a noteworthy
mechanism for genome evolution and divergence.
Unlike whole genome duplication, gene relocation following duplication within a LCR can modify a gene's
genomic context. Specifically, cis-acting elements neighbouring the ancestral locus may be different from the cisacting elements neighbouring the descendent locus, causing the positional effects on the gene to be altered. Thus,
changes in expression and function are considered to be
another consequence of gene relocation. Interestingly, the
slight variation in DPY19L2 expression (Fig. 4A) could
indicate a change in regulation. One interpretation of this
finding is that the change in expression is caused by a difference in cis-acting elements between the functional
gene's ancestral and descendant locations.
Our data is consistent with the concept that there are two
major fates of gene duplication: retention of both copies
or pseudogenization of one of the transcripts. Within the
set of LCRs, we were able to identify two homologous
functional genes, apparently created by a duplication
event of a common ancestor homologous to the C. elegans
DPY-19 gene. These genes illustrate how both copies of a
gene duplicate can be retained. Preservation of both copies may be due to some selective advantage, either
through increased dosage, neofunctionalization, or complementary degeneration leading to subfunctionalization.
These functional genes have been duplicated within LCRs,
creating new transcripts. However, for both genes only a
single transcript has remained active. The others, although
transcribed, are all pseudogenes due to loss of coding
potential through partial duplication or accumulation of
deleterious mutations (Fig. 3A, 3B). This supports the
notion that pseudogenization is the most common fate of
gene duplication [8]. In addition, we tested for selection
acting on the three duplicated pseudogenes containing a

Page 9 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:45

substantial ORF. In two of the three transcripts, selection
was relaxed such that they appeared to be undergoing
neutral selection. In the third transcript, the selection was
relaxed relative to the functional gene, but some purifying
selection, indicated by Ka/Ks <1, was still apparent (Table
1). It is important to note that an increased ratio may also
represent a mixture of positive and negative selection.
However, in combination these analyses show that the
inactive transcripts appear to be undergoing neutral evolution, indicating that they have indeed lost their coding
potential and are not being selectively maintained. This
fits with the perception that most pseudogenes, like noncoding regions, are free of selection [42,43]. Evidence of
selection in one transcript could indicate that it has some
actively maintained function. However, the significantly
relaxed selection in this case may suggest a recent inactivation that has yet to accumulate enough mutations for neutral selection to be distinguished. In any case, we expect
the non-functional remnants of gene duplication to continue to diverge from the original copy, along with the
other non-coding regions of the LCR, until eventually all
evidence of duplication is erased.
The two functional genes, along with two additional
homologues outside of the LCRs, constitute a novel gene
family that we designate as the DPY19L family. Although
the function of this family is unknown, each member has
a large complement of predicted transmembrane
domains, indicating that they are functional within one of
the cellular membranes. Along with these domains, this
family contains a novel putative motif of high conservation (see Additional file 6). The high sequence conservation in this putative motif suggests that its sequence may
represent a novel functionally important domain that has
been maintained throughout the evolution of this gene
family. Interestingly, DPY19L family members have
undergone multiple duplications throughout their evolution. Ancient duplications before the divergence of fish
led to the creation of two paralogues (DPY19L3 and
DPY19L4), while an additional duplication after the
divergence of amphibia, yet before the divergence of
mammals, created another gene (DPY19L2) (Fig. 4B).
Analyses of the human genome sequence indicate that the
duplication of these genes is an ongoing process. In fact,
all four human paralogues show evidence for relatively
recent gene duplication. DPY19L1 and DPY19L2 are both
contained in recent low copy repeats, while DPY19L3 and
DPY19L4 appear to have processed pseudogenes with
duplications of at least 3 exons. Duplications of genes are
known to play important roles in gene evolution. The
recent duplications of all four human genes suggest that
the DPY19L gene family is still evolving and may be an
important family in the divergence of species.

Conclusion
The catalogue of LCRs provides an excellent resource for
the study of genomic evolution. By characterizing the relationship between sets of LCRs and the genes they contain,
we can attempt to understand the mechanisms behind
these rearrangements and how they affect evolution. LCRs
appear to influence genome composition by affecting
genomic sequence structure, gene content and gene order.
The last of these influences has not been vigorously investigated. Although this is one of the first observations
showing a change in gene location with a set of LCRs, we
expect that many other examples are present within LCRrich genomes, and their identification could lead to a better understanding of genome divergence and speciation.

Methods
In silico identification of related LCRs
We queried masked genomic sequence against NCBI's
nonredundant (nr) and high-throughput genomic
sequence (htgs) databases using Blastn [24] to identify
related copies of the LCRs. Eight regions >5 kb with ≥90%
sequence identity were detected. Complete sequences for
each of the LCRs was then obtained; for LCRs on Chromosome 7 we used sequence from the Chromosome 7 annotation project (CRA_TCAGchr7.v2), while the LCR
sequence on Chromosome 12 was acquired from NCBI's
public Build 35. Duplication boundaries were then determined by comparing the regions using Blast 2 sequence
[25] and mVISTA [26-28]. Using the Blast 2 sequence
results, we used a C++ program (CircleGraph, H.
Wagenaar, unpubl.) to visually display the relationships
between each of the LCRs (Fig. 2b). For this analysis,
modules, or discrete regions of high identity, were concatenated when they were <5 kb apart or separated by
repetitive elements, as long as the modules maintained
their orientations between copies. Also, modules <5 kb
were eliminated from the analysis, causing some boundaries (LCR7F in Fig. 2B) to appear uncovered by duplications.
Transcript characterization
Transcripts within the LCRs were identified using fulllength mRNAs and spliced ESTs annotated by UCSC's
Genome Browser [29]. RT-PCR was used to confirm the
expression of transcripts annotated as 'Known Genes'. For
novel transcripts, uncharacterized mRNA and ESTs, along
with exons predicted by homology analyses, were amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced to determine the complete
sequence. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was
employed in cases where the 5' and/or 3' gene sequence
was uncharacterized. RACE experiments were conducted
using marathon-ready cDNA (Clontech) according to
manufacturer's instructions. Primer sequences used for
these experiments are available upon request.

Genomic organization of each transcript was determined
by probing the sequence against the human genome using
UCSC's BLAT tool (Fig. 3). Open reading frames (ORF)
and protein sequences were determined through conceptual 6-frame translation using NCBI ORF finder []. Transcripts having an ORF coding for >100 amino acids, and
spanning the entire transcript, from the first to last exon,
were annotated as genes. Transcripts not meeting these
criteria were classified as pseudogenes.
DNA sequences of the pseudogenes were manually
aligned against the ORFs of the two functional genes.
These transcripts were truncated such that exons that
showed no homology to the functional genes were
removed from the alignment. DPY19L3 was also aligned
with these sequences and was used as an outgroup in the
phylogenetic analysis. This alignment was converted to
nexus format and analyzed using PAUP software []. A
maximum likelihood tree was constructed using the general time reversible plus gamma (GTR+G) model of evolution and bootstrapped with 100 replicates (parameters
for nucleotide composition, substitution rates and
gamma shape were estimated by PAUP) (see Additional
file 5).
Expression analyses of the four human DPY19L genes
were performed using RT-PCR in 14 tissues. Primer
sequences and conditions are available upon request. For
DPY19L2, each of the products was purified using microCLEAN (Microzone) and sequenced to determine contamination of the DPY19L2 expression with pseudogene
amplification. Pseudogene amplification was qualified by
assessing the presence or absence of transcript specific paralagous sequence variants.
Homology and evolutionary analyses
Using the BLAST [24] and BLAT [29] tools, we were able
to identify human paralogues of the two protein coding
genes detected in our set of LCRs. In addition, we used
these same programs to search for orthologues of each of
the human genes in a wide range of organisms. Orthologues were identified using BLAT against genome assemblies on the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics webpage [].
Where no known orthologue is annotated, we assembled
transcripts using mRNAs, ESTs and gene predictions.
When no transcript information was present, genomic
sequences were used to identify conserved exons, taking
into account intron/exon boundaries. The trace archive
database (NCBI) was searched when gaps in genome
assemblies were encountered. ClustalW [30] was used to
align the assembled protein homologues and MEGA3
[31] was used to construct a neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree. The neighbour-joining tree was created using
the Jones-Taylor-Thornton matrix [] for amino acid evolution and bootstrap values were calculated with 250 repli-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/45

cations. Additional trees were built, using alternate
phylogenetic methods (neighbour-joining trees under
various models of evolution, minimum evolution trees
and maximum parsimony trees) to verify the observed
phylogeny.
We also used MEGA3 to determine the evolution of the
recently duplicated transcripts. We first aligned the coding
nucleotides of a gene against the longest homologous
ORF in its pseudogene(s) using ClustalW. For this analysis
we only used 'Known' transcripts. In the novel transcripts,
the ORFs were too short to show significant results. To
determine the codon position bias we used MEGA3 to calculate the nucleotide p-distance between the transcripts at
each of the coding positions. Next, we used the Nei-Gojobori [] p-distance method to calculate the frequency of
synonymous substitutions (Ks), the frequency of non-synonymous substitutions (Ka) and the ratio between them
(Ka/Ks).
Protein structure analyses
Protein domain architectures, including transmembrane
domains, were determined using SMART [34] and Pfam
[35]. Putative functionally relevant motifs were identified
using the program MEME [36]. Statistical analysis was
performed on these sequences to determine if the predicted motifs were more highly conserved between species. We used MEGA3 to calculate amino acid and
nucleotide p-distances inside and outside these motifs,
while testing for significant differences with a Wilcoxon
signed rank test.
