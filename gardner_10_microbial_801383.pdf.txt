A microbial detection array (MDA) for viral and
bacterial detection
Shea N Gardner, Crystal J Jaing, Kevin S McLoughlin, Tom R Slezak*

Abstract
Background: Identifying the bacteria and viruses present in a complex sample is useful in disease diagnostics,
product safety, environmental characterization, and research. Array-based methods have proven utility to detect in
a single assay at a reasonable cost any microbe from the thousands that have been sequenced.
Methods: We designed a pan-Microbial Detection Array (MDA) to detect all known viruses (including phages),
bacteria and plasmids and developed a novel statistical analysis method to identify mixtures of organisms from
complex samples hybridized to the array. The array has broader coverage of bacterial and viral targets and is based
on more recent sequence data and more probes per target than other microbial detection/discovery arrays in the
literature. Family-specific probes were selected for all sequenced viral and bacterial complete genomes, segments,
and plasmids. Probes were designed to tolerate some sequence variation to enable detection of divergent species
with homology to sequenced organisms, and to have no significant matches to the human genome sequence.
Results: In blinded testing on spiked samples with single or multiple viruses, the MDA was able to correctly
identify species or strains. In clinical fecal, serum, and respiratory samples, the MDA was able to detect and
characterize multiple viruses, phage, and bacteria in a sample to the family and species level, as confirmed by PCR.
Conclusions: The MDA can be used to identify the suite of viruses and bacteria present in complex samples.

Background
For microbial surveillance and discovery based on
nucleic acids from an uncharacterized sample, sequencing provides the most in-depth and unbiased information. However, the expense and time required for
sequencing using high throughput methods such as 454
(Roche), Solexa (Illumina), or SOLiD (Life Technologies)
can make these methods prohibitive for routine use,
especially when the resources required for data processing and analysis are taken into account. Viruses at low
concentration may be missed if coverage is insufficient,
and host sequence may make up 90% or more of the
reads [1]. At the other end of the cost spectrum, PCR
assays are very fast and sensitive, but have limited capacity for multiplexing (to test for the presence of several
organisms simultaneously). They are also intolerant of
primer-target mismatches; this is an advantage for
detecting a microbe whose sequence is precisely known,

but a great disadvantage for discovery of novel species,
or for detecting variant strains of a known species.
Microarrays span a middle ground between sequencing and PCR, offering high probe density for detection
of diverse and possibly unexpected targets, costs in the
hundreds rather than thousands of dollars per sample,
and processing times on the order of 24 hours or less.
Arrays can be designed with a combination of detection
and discovery probes, which respectively target speciesspecific regions (for precise characterization of known
pathogens), or more conserved regions (to enable detection of novel organisms with some homology to previously sequenced organisms). Compared to sequencing,
microarray analysis has the disadvantage that probes
designed from known sequences are unlikely to detect
truly novel organisms lacking homology to those
sequences. However, microbial genomes are difficult and
time-consuming to characterize when they have no
similarity to known sequences, so the ability of sequencing to identify novel genomes has limited practical benefit in a rapid diagnostic context.

Microbial detection arrays provide an assessment of
known pathogens complementary to that provided by a
functional gene array, such as the array to detect virulence and antibiotic resistance gene families described in
[2]. Detection arrays can tell what organisms are present, while functional arrays can tell what capabilities
those organisms might possess. Together these tools
may be applied to detect antibiotic resistant or virulent
pathogen variants, natural chimeras, or genetically engineered organisms with unusual gene content.
Detection/discovery microarrays have proven useful in
identifying or discovering viruses with homology to
known species [3-8]. They may thus be used to guide
the selection of a subset of samples for further analysis
by sequencing. Arrays can also be applied to study clinical samples for which PCR diagnostics have been uninformative. Often, the cause of a clinically severe
infection is unknown, complicating the decision of
whether to treat with antibiotics, antivirals, or other
therapies. With optimization, and sufficiently high
pathogen titers, we have successfully generated array
results in as little as 2 hours (unpublished data). Moreover, arrays can assist in uncovering co-infections with
more than one organism. Microbial detection arrays can
also be used to check isolate stocks and vaccines for
adventitious contaminants [9]. Finally, arrays can be
used to assess the complexity of a metagenomic sample
to determine the desired depth for sequencing, potentially saving costs on low complexity samples. Microarrays may reveal greater diversity in complex
environmental samples than sequencing of a typical
sized clone library [10]. Until the processing time and
cost of high throughput sequencing (including data analysis) decreases enough to be feasible for large numbers
of samples at sufficient depth, microarrays will continue
to be a valuable tool.
Several groups have designed microarrays containing
probes for microbial detection, discovery, or a combination of both [3-8,10-20]. Their approaches may be distinguished according to the range of pathogens targeted,
the probe design strategy, and the array platform used.
The ViroChip discovery array was one of the first to
target a broad range of pathogens; it is best known for
its role in characterizing SARS as a coronavirus [4,5,14].
It was designed by selecting probes from regions conserved in the same family or genus based on BLAST
nucleotide sequence similarity, so that all complete viral
genomes available when it was designed (2002) were
represented by 3 probes. Later generations of the ViroChip had 5-10 probes per genome and covered a larger
set of genomes; version 3 of the array included approximately 22,000 probes. It was fabricated using spotted
oligo technology, which limits the number of probes
that can be included on one array.

Chou et al. [11] designed conserved genus probes and
species specific probes covering 53 viral families and
214 genera, requiring two probes per virus. They
empirically tested a subset of 72 probes targeting the
coronavirus, flavivirus, and enterovirus families against
pure cultures of six species, although they did not examine clinical samples.
Palacios et al. [12] built the GreeneChipPm, an array
targeting vertebrate viruses and rRNA sequences of
fungi, bacteria, and protozoa, containing approximately
30,000 probes. It is an oligonucleotide array fabricated
using the Agilent ink-jet system. Viral probes were
designed to target a minimum of three genomic regions
for each family or genus, including at least one highly
conserved region coding for polymerase or structural
proteins, and two or more variable regions. Bacterial,
fungal and protozoan probes were exclusively designed
against variable segments of rRNA genes (16S for bacteria, 18S for eukaryotes), flanked by highly conserved
regions, so that the target regions could be amplified
with a small number of specific PCR primers. Other
groups have followed similar strategies for bacterial
array design [10,15-17]. The lack of any similar genes
universally conserved among viruses precludes using
this approach for viral target amplification.
Similar arrays designed by the same group include the
GreeneChipVr [3] (targeting viruses only) and the
GreeneChipResp [18] (targeting respiratory pathogens).
The GreeneChipPm array successfully identified viruses
at the species level, and was used to implicate Plasmodium falciparum for an unexplained death. It performed
less well with bacterial samples, because probes against
the 16S rRNA variable regions frequently crosshybridized across taxa, so that some bacteria could only
be identified at family or class resolution.
Array design to fit all probes to span an entire kingdom on a single microarray demands substantial investment in probe selection algorithms. Jabado et al. [19]
developed probe design software used to target conserved amino acid regions in viruses using profile hidden Markov models and motif analysis, for which
uniqueness relative to non-targets was not a consideration. To our knowledge, experimental data has not yet
been published for this array. Satya et al. [20] built a
software pipeline TOFI-beta for selecting target-specific
probes that are unique relative to a database of nontargets, without requirements for conservation within a
set of multiple targets, and illustrated its application in
silico using two bacterial genomes.
In this study we describe a comprehensive, highdensity oligonucleotide array for detection and discovery
of bacteria and viruses. The large number of features on
this array, together with an efficient probe design strategy, made it possible to cover all complete bacterial and

Gardner et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:668
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/668

viral genome sequences with a much larger number of
probes per target than previously reported array designs.
We discuss the process used for array design, and report
the results of testing the array against known mixtures
of DNA and RNA viruses, as well as a variety of clinical
(fecal, sputum, and serum) samples. We also present a
novel statistical algorithm for analysis of detection/discovery arrays, which combines a predictive model of
probe hybridization with a greedy likelihood maximization procedure to identify the combination of targets in
a complex sample that best explains the observed probe
intensity pattern.

Results
Array design

The array design process is diagrammed in Figure 1. In
designing probes for our array, we sought to balance the
goals of conservation and uniqueness, prioritizing oligo
sequences that were conserved, to the extent possible,
within the family of the targeted organism, and unique
relative to other families and kingdoms. The design process is detailed in Methods, and summarized here.
We designed arrays with larger numbers of probes per
sequence (50 or more for viruses, 15 or more for bacteria) than previous arrays having only 2-10 probes per
target. The large number of probes per target was
expected to improve sensitivity, an important consideration given possible amplification bias in the random
PCR sample preparation protocol, which could result in
nonamplification of genome regions targeted by some
probes [7]. All bacteria and viruses with sequenced genomes available at the time we began the MDA v.1
design (spring 2007) were represented: ~38,000 virus
sequences representing ~2200 species, and ~3500 bacterial sequences representing ~900 species. Version 1 of
the array had only viral probes. A second version of the
array (MDA v.2) was designed using both viral and bacterial probes. Probes were selected to avoid sequences
with high levels of similarity to human, bacterial and
viral sequences not in the target family. Low levels of
sequence similarity across families were allowed selectively, when the statistical model of probe hybridization
used in our array analysis predicted a low likelihood of
cross-hybridization.
Favoring more conserved probes within a family
enabled us to minimize the total number of probes
needed to cover all existing genomes with a high probe
density per target, enhancing the capability to identify
the species of known organisms and to detect unsequenced or emerging organisms. Strain or subtype identification was not a goal of probe design for this array.
Nevertheless, our ability to combine information from
multiple probes in our analysis made it possible to discriminate between strains of many organisms.

The array design also incorporated a set of 2,600
negative control probes. These probes had sequences
that were randomly generated, but with length and GC
content distributions chosen to match those of the target-specific probes.
Modeling of probe-target hybridization

We developed a novel statistical method for detection
array analysis, by modeling the likelihood of the
observed probe intensities as a function of the combination of targets present in the sample, and performing
greedy maximization to find a locally optimal set of targets; the details of the algorithm are shown in Methods.
It incorporates a probabilistic model of probe-target
hybridization based on probe-target similarity and probe
sequence complexity, with parameters fitted to experimental data from samples with known genome
sequences. To accurately determine the organism(s)
responsible for a given array result, the pattern of both
positive and negative probe signals is taken into
account. The algorithm is designed to enable quantifiable predictions of likelihood for the presence of multiple organisms in a complex sample.
A key simplification used in this algorithm was to
transform the probe intensities to binary signal values
(“positive” or “negative”), representing whether or not
the intensity exceeds an array-specific detection threshold. The threshold was typically calculated as the 99th
percentile of the intensities of the random control
probes on the array. The outcome variables in the likelihood model are the positive signal probabilities for each
probe, given the presence of a particular combination of
targets in the sample. The resulting predictions are
more robust in the presence of noisy data, since the outcome variable is a probability rather than the actual
intensity. Discretizing the intensities also led to considerable savings of computation time and resources, which
are significant for arrays containing hundreds of thousands of probes.
Although one might assume that reducing intensities to
binary values means discarding valuable information, the
log intensity distribution for a typical array (Figure 2)
shows that the actual information loss is much less than
expected. The figure shows separate density curves for
three classes of probes: those with BLAST hits to one of
the known targets in the sample ("target-specific”), those
without hits ("nonspecific”), and negative controls. A vertical dashed line is drawn at the 99th percentile threshold
intensity. Log2 intensities for target-specific probes either
cluster with the control and nonspecific probes (when
they have low BLAST scores, usually), or approach the
maximum possible value (16). This occurs because detection array probes are designed for high sensitivity to low
target concentrations, so that probe intensities approach

the saturation level whenever a probe has significant
similarity to a target in the sample. Therefore, the information content of a probe signal is already reduced by
saturation effects.
Certain probes were found to be more likely than
others to yield positive signals, even when the sample
on the array was known to lack any targets with

sequences complementary to them. We observed that
this nonspecific hybridization occurs more often with
probes having low sequence complexity, i.e. long homopolymers and tandem repeats. One measure of the complexity of a probe sequence is the entropy of its trimer
frequency distribution, which we compute as described
in Methods. To study whether the sequence entropy

the frequency to a log-odds value, and plotted the logodds against the trimer entropy, as shown in Figure 3.
We also fit a logistic regression model for the probe signal as a function of entropy; a dashed line with the
resulting slope and intercept is shown in the plot. The
figure shows that the trimer entropy is an excellent predictor of the non-specific positive signal probability, and
that probes with low entropy are more likely to give
positive signals regardless of the target sequence.
While the nonspecific probe signal probability
depends on the probe sequence only, the target-specific
signal probability was assumed to be a function of both
the probe sequence and probe-target sequence similarity. To determine an appropriate set of predictors for
the specific signal probability, given the presence of a
specific target, we BLASTed the probe sequences against
our database of target genomes, obtaining the best alignment (if any) for each probe-target pair. We then
derived various covariates from the probe-target alignment, including the alignment length, number of mismatches, bit score, E-value, predicted melting
temperature, and alignment start and end positions. We
tested all combinations of up to three covariates, using
logistic regression to fit models to data from samples
containing known targets, and performed leave-one-out
validation to find the combination with the strongest
predictive value. The best combination included three
covariates: (1) The predicted melting temperature, computed as described in Methods; (2) the BLAST bit score
and (3) the alignment start position relative to the 5’
end of the probe. We expected the alignment start position to have a significant effect, because we observed in
our previous work [2] that probe-target mismatches had
a weaker effect on hybridization if the mismatch was
closer to the 3’ end of the probe (nearer to the array
surface).

Probe Sequence Trimer Entropy

on the trimer entropy of the probe sequences. Dashed line is a
logistic regression fit to the probe entropy and signal data.

To find a combination of targets whose presence in the
sample best explains the observed data, we used a
greedy algorithm to find a local maximum for the loglikelihood, as described in Methods. We can think of
the likelihood maximization algorithm as an iterative
process, in which we first find the target that explains
the largest portion of the observed positive probe signals, while minimizing the number of negative probes
that would be expected to bind to the target. In each
subsequent iteration, we choose the target that explains
the largest part of the signal not already explained by
the first target, while again minimizing the number of
expected negative probes. The process continues until a
maximal portion of the observed probe signals are
explained, or for a specified maximum number of
iterations.

Figure 6 MDA v.1 results for a clinical induced sputum sample.

The bar graphs in the left-hand column represent expectation (mean) values of the positive probe counts for each
target, given the presence of the corresponding target genome. The larger “expected” score is obtained by summing
the positive signal probabilities for all probes; the smaller

“detected” score is derived by limiting this sum to probes
having positive signals. Because probes often cross-hybridize to multiple related genome sequences, the numbers
of “expected” and “detected” probes may greatly exceed
the number of probes that were actually designed for a

Several viruses with sequenced genomes (adenovirus type

array identified the known virus as the highest scoring target (data not shown). Several mixtures of both RNA and
DNA viruses were also tested (Table 1). All spiked species
were detected in the mixture, including most of the segments of bluetongue virus (BTV). Strain discrimination
was not expected, since probes were designed from
regions conserved within viral families. Nevertheless, the

gamma-proteobacterium (collected in the coastal Pacific
Ocean at 10 m depth) were detected with low log-odds
scores on numerous experiments using different samples.
Genome sequences for these were not included in the
probe design because they became available only after we
designed the microarray probes or because they were not
classified into a bacterial taxonomic family; therefore
probes were not screened for cross-hybridization against
these targets. However, these sequences were included in
the analysis database, since this database included
sequences not classified as to bacterial family and it was
compiled a few months after the probes were designed.
Genome comparisons indicate that M. ferrooxydans,
TM7b, and marine gamma proteobacterium HTCC2143
share 70%, 55%, and 61%, respectively, of their sequence
with other bacteria and viruses, based on simply considering every oligo of size at least 18 nt also present in
other sequenced viruses or bacteria, so many of the
probes designed for other organisms may also hybridize
to these targets.
Testing on Blinded Samples from Pure Culture

Blinded samples were provided from collaborator Robert
Tesh at UTMB for 11 viruses. We hybridized each of
those samples separately to MDA v.2 and predicted the
identities of each virus (Table 3). Ten of 11 of the species predicted by the MDA were confirmed by Dr. Tesh.

In addition, endogenous retroviruses were also detected
in 7 of the samples as well as the uninfected Vero cell
control, indicating the presence of host DNA from the
culture cells. These included one or more of the following: Baboon endogenous virus strain M7 and human
endogenous retroviruses K113, K115, and HCML-ARV,
with human endogenous retrovirus K113 being the most
common. The one sample that we failed to detect on
the array was vesicular stomatitis virus, NJ (VSV NJ).
We confirmed that it was present in the sample using
two proprietary, unpublished TaqMan assays developed
by colleagues at LLNL and tested by LLNL colleagues at
Plum Island that specifically detect VSV NJ. There were
no complete genomes of VSV NJ available. Consequently, we designed no probes for this species. Nor
was it included in our database for the statistical analyses. It is sufficiently different from the genomes available for VSV Indiana that none of those probes had
BLAST similarity to the partial sequences available for
VSV NJ. There were 7 probes from the ViroChip corresponding to VSV NJ that were detected. These probes
were designed from partial sequences [4].
Detection of viruses and bacteria from clinical samples

We tested a clinical induced sputum sample provided to

coronavirus HKU1. We confirmed the results using specific PCR for these two viruses (Additional file 1). The
results were also confirmed by the DeRisi lab using the
ViroChip. The MDA results indicated small log-odds
scores for influenza A, leek yellow stripe potyvirus, and
HIV-1, although these low scores are a result of just a
few probes and are likely due to nonspecific binding
rather than true positives. Other samples tested using
MDA v.1 also had low scoring predictions for Influenza
A and Leek yellow stripe potyvirus (see Table 1), which
we suspect were due to non-specific binding.
Closer examination of probes giving high signal intensities that were not consistent with the “detected” organisms showed that there were some “sticky” probes that
seemed to bind non-specifically. On the MDA v.2 array,
we noted that 141 probes were detected in a majority
(31 out of 60) of arrays hybridized to a wide variety of
sample types. A small number of these probes were
found to have significant BLAST hits to the human genome. Since most of the samples tested on the array
were either human clinical samples or were grown in
Vero cells (an African green monkey cell line), the frequent high signals for these few probes can be explained
by the presence of primate DNA in the sample. The
vast majority of sticky probes, however, were not
explained by cross-hybridization to host DNA. We did
note significant differences between sticky and nonsticky probes in the distributions of trimer entropy and
hybridization free energy; sticky probes had smaller
entropies (mean 4.6 vs 4.8 bits, p = 7.5 × 10 -14 ) and
more negative free energies (mean -70.5 vs -66.8 kcal/
mol, p = 3.8 × 10 -13 ) compared to 1755 non-sticky
probes detected in 11 or fewer samples. Consequently,
in v.2 of the chip design, we imposed an entropy filter
as described in the methods, and additionally designed
more probe sequences at the expense of the number of
replicates per probe.

We tested partially amplified clinical samples provided
by Joe DeRisi’s laboratory at UCSF on MDA v.2. The
source (e.g. fecal or serum) was blinded during our analyses, but was provided later: sample 1_5 from serum
(Figure 7), and the rest from fecal sources (Figures 8, 9,
10, and 11). No patient history was provided. A strong
signal indicating the presence of hepatitis B virus was
detected in sample 1_5 (Figure 7). In all the remaining
samples, signals were detected for a mixture of both
viruses and bacteria, many of which are known to be
associated with gastrointestinal distress. All of the
organisms detected by the array were confirmed by PCR
except Serratia proteamaculans in sample 2_3 and the
E. coli pAPEC O2-ColV plasmid in sample 2_4 (Additional file 1) In some cases, multiple species in a genus
have similarly high log-odds ratios, suggesting that a
member of that genus is likely to be present, but the
MDA cannot make a definitive call as to which species.
For example, signals for multiple Streptococcus species
were detected in sample 2_1 (Figure 8). We expect that
this pattern could arise in cases where a novel unsequenced isolate from the genus is present, in cases
where conservation at the genus level is sufficiently high
that the conserved probes do not provide species discrimination, or when multiple related organisms are present. Since the probes were selected from conserved
regions within a family, the array was not designed for
stringent species or strain discrimination. In sample 2_3
(Figure 10) we saw a strong signal for the presence of
chicken anemia virus which was confirmed by PCR.
This circovirus infects chickens, pointing to a dietary
influence on the components of this human fecal sample. It is similar to the recently discovered and widespread human TT virus and TTV-like mini virus
(TLMV) [21]. Other studies have also found viruses
from food in fecal samples [22]. Phage are also commonly detected in feces, particularly when sample preparation enriches for phage, for example, by purification

in a cesium chloride gradient [23]. We did not do any
gradient purification for phage enrichment, and
although we detected more signals from bacteria than
from the bacteriophage that infect those bacteria, we did
detect signals for Staphylococcus aureus phage as the
viral component of sample 2_4, as well as signals that
its host bacteria was present (Figure 11).

Discussion
We report on a high density oligo microarray and statistical analysis method that has detected viral and bacterial sequences from single DNA and RNA viruses and
mixtures thereof, various clinical samples, and blinded
cell culture samples provided to us by our collaborators.
Results from clinical samples were validated using PCR.
The MDA v.2 has higher probe density and larger phylogenetic representation of viral and bacterial sequenced
genomes than other published array designs. It can be
applied to problems in viral and bacterial detection from
pure or complex environmental or clinical samples. It
may be particularly useful to widen the scope of search
for microbial identification when specific PCR fails, as
well as to identify co-infecting organisms.
The analysis method described here differs in several
key ways from previous statistical approaches to analyze
microbial detection arrays, such as E-Predict [24] and
GreeneLAMP [12]. E-Predict compares a probe intensity
vector for each array against a theoretical hybridization
free energy vector for each sequence in a target database, both normalized to unit length, using the Pearson
correlation coefficient. Significance values are assigned
to the correlation scores by comparing them against an
empirical distribution derived from over 1,000 array
experiments. To handle samples that may contain a
mixture of organisms, there is an iterative version of
E-Predict, which, after identifying the most likely target
on an array, sets the intensities of the probes matching
the target to zero, computes new correlation coefficients,
and repeats the identification process. Since it requires a
corpus of data from previous experiments with the same
array design, E-Predict cannot be applied to new, prototype array designs. E-Predict also has limited applicability
to complex samples, in which several closely related
strains of the same species may be present.
The GreeneLAMP algorithm [12] assigns probes to
target taxa using BLAST alignments, and computes a
p-value for each probe intensity by performing a z-test
against a log-normal distribution. Intensities are first
background-corrected, using data from a matched control array when available, or random control probes on
the same array otherwise. The parameters of the distribution are inferred from the intensities of all probes on
the array, under the assumption (usually justified) that
only a small fraction of probes will hybridize to the

Page 16 of 21

target on the array. Probes are categorized as positive or
negative by comparing their p-values against a fixed
threshold. The p-values for the positive probes associated with each taxon are then multiplied, and an
aggregate p-value computed for the product, using the
method of Bailey [25]. Finally, candidate taxa are ranked
by the aggregate p-value. The GreeneLAMP method
depends heavily on the assumption that probe intensities
are independent measurements of target genome abundances, which is not always justified. An iterative version
of the method has not been reported to date; this makes
it inappropriate for identifying mixtures of organisms in
a sample, since the output of the algorithm is a single
ranked list of taxa
The MDA array design and accompanying analysis
algorithm have been found to perform well in identifying mixtures of known pathogens. In cases where a sample contains an organism that has not been sequenced
(or whose sequence is not in our analysis database), but
is sufficiently similar to other sequenced microbes, the
analysis will identify multiple related organisms most
similar to the one in the sample. Similar results will be
seen when the sample DNA is degraded or low in concentration, so the analysis cannot determine that a novel
or unsequenced organism is present. Therefore, users of
the MDA will need to interpret the data in the context
of what else is known about the sample, to determine
whether the predicted organisms are exact matches to
known species or are novel but with some similarity to
other sequenced microbes. Highly novel targets with no
similarity to genomes in the database or probes on the
array will not be detected. The failure of the MDA to
detect VSV NJ in pure culture illustrates this well, and
highlights a shortcoming of our approach to use only
complete genomes to design the array. Future versions
of the array will include all available sequence data,
including partial sequences and gene fragments, for species lacking complete genomes. Modified statistical algorithms will then be required to deal with sequence
length bias when partial genomes are included in the
database. Most importantly, as new sequence data
becomes available from newly discovered or newly
sequenced organisms, the MDA must be updated with
probes to detect them. We are currently designing Version 3 of the MDA to address these issues, probing both
partial and complete bacterial and viral sequences, as
well as fungi and some protozoa.

Conclusions
The MDA is a tool to identify viral and bacterial organisms present in simple or complex samples. We have
demonstrated the capability of the array and our statistical methods to identify multiple bacteria and viruses in
clinical samples and verified results with PCR.

Gardner et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:668

Improvements are suggested for the design of future
detection arrays, and continued updates to incorporate
probes for newly sequenced microbes will be required.

Methods
Probe design for family level characterization

Figure 1 summarizes our array design process. We
downloaded all complete genomes, segments, and plasmid sequences, organized by family, for all bacteria and
viruses, from NCBI Genbank, Integrated Microbial
Genomics (IMG) project at the Joint Genome Institute,
The Comprehensive Microbial Resource (CMR) at the
JC Venter Institute, and The Sanger Institute in the
United Kingdom, with some additional proprietary
whole-genome data from collaborators. We included
only bacteria under the superkingdom Bacteria (eubacteria) taxonomy node at NCBI, and did not include the
Archaea. Sequence data was current as of the time that
probe design began for a given probe set: 34,625 viral
target sequences on April 25, 2007 (viral probes, v.1),
38,402 viral target sequences on October 29, 2007 (viral
probes, v.2), and 3,477 bacterial target sequences on July
12, 2007 (bacterial probes, v.2). These represented 2195
viral species and 924 bacterial species.
Probes were selected from whole genomes, without
regard to gene locations or identities, letting the
sequences themselves determine the best signature
regions and preclude bias by pre-selection of genes. In
prior work, we have found that the length of longest
perfect match (PM) is a strong predictor of hybridization intensity, and that for probes at least 50 nt long,
PM ≤ 20 bp have signal less than 20% of that with a
perfect match over the entire length of the probe. [2]
This is similar to results from a systematic study of viral
probe hybridization characteristics by [7]. Therefore, for
each target family we eliminated regions with perfect
matches to sequences outside the target family. Using the
suffix array software Vmatch [26], perfect match subsequences of at least 17 nt long present in non-target viral
families or 25 nt long present in the human genome or
nontarget bacterial families were eliminated from consideration as possible probe subsequences. Sequence similarity of probes to non-target sequences below this
threshold was allowed, but could be accounted for using
the statistical algorithm described below.
From these family-specific regions, we designed probes
50-66 bases long for one family at a time using the
methods described in [2]. Probes were sufficiently long
(50-66 bases) to tolerate some sequence variation,
although slightly shorter than the 70-mer probes used
on previous arrays [4,11,12] because of the additional
synthesis cycles, and therefore cost, of making 70-mers
on the NimbleGen platform. Long probes improve
hybridization sensitivity and efficiency, alleviate

Page 17 of 21

sequence-dependent variation in hybridization, and
improve the capability to detect unsequenced microbes.
Quantifying the microbe load was not a goal of this
array; sensitive detection of microbe presence was the
aim, facilitated by the higher sensitivity of longer probes.
As in [2], we generated candidate probes using MIT’s
Primer3 software [27], followed by Tm and homodimer,
hairpin, and probe-target free energy (ΔG) prediction
using Unafold [28]. Candidate probes with unsuitable
ΔG’s or Tm’s were excluded as described in [2]. Desirable range for these parameters was 50 ≤ length ≤ 66,
T m ≥80°C, 25% ≤ GC% ≤ 75%, ΔG homodimer = ΔG of
homodimer formation > 15 kcal/mol, ΔGhairpin = ΔG of
hairpin formation > -11 kcal/mol, and ΔG adjusted =
ΔGcomplement - 1.45 ΔGhairpin - 0.33 ΔG homodimer ≤ -52
kcal/mol. For the v2 array design, which includes bacterial probes, an additional minimum sequence complexity
constraint was enforced, requiring a trimer frequency
entropy of at least 4.5 (calculation described below). If
fewer than a minimum number of candidate probes per
target sequence passed all the criteria, then those criteria were relaxed to allow a sufficient number of probes
per target. To relax the criteria, first candidates that passed
the Primer3 criteria but failed the Unafold filters were
allowed. If no candidates passed the Primer3 criteria, then
regions passing the target-specificity (e.g. family specific)
and minimum length constraints were allowed. From
these candidates, we selected probes in decreasing order of
the number of targets represented by that probe (i.e.
probes detecting more targets in the family were chosen
preferentially over those that detected fewer targets in the
family), where a target was considered to be represented if
a probe matched it with at least 85% sequence similarity
over the total probe length, and a perfectly matching subsequence of at least 29 contiguous bases spanned the middle of the probe. For probes that tied in the number of
targets represented, a secondary ranking was used to favor
probes most dispersed across the target from those probes
which had already been selected to represent that target.
The probe with the same conservation rank that occurred
at the farthest distance from any probe already selected
from the target sequence was the next probe to be chosen
to represent that target.
The MDA v.1 array contained probes representing all
complete viral genomes or segments associated with a
known viral family, with at least 15 probes per target
(Table 4). It did not include unclassified targets not
designated under a family. On the v.2 array, every viral
genome or segment was represented by at least 50
probes, totaling 170,399 probes, except for 1,084 viral
genomes that were not associated under a family-ranked
taxonomic node ("nonConforming sequences”). These
had a minimum of 40 probes per sequence totaling
12,342 probes. There were a minimum of 15 probes per

Gardner et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:668
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/668

bacterial genome or plasmid sequence, totaling 7,864
probes on the v.2 array. Bacterial genomes that were not
associated under a family-ranked taxonomic node were
not included in the array design.
On both MDA v.1 and v.2, as controls for the presence of
human DNA/mRNA from clinical samples, we designed
1,278 probes to human immune response genes. For targets, the genes for GO:0009615 ("response to virus”) were
downloaded from the Gene Ontology AmiGO website
http://amigo.geneontology.org, filtering for Homo sapien
sequences. There were 58 protein sequences available at the
time (July 12, 2007), and from these, the gene sequences of
length up to 4× the protein length were downloaded from
the NCBI nucleotide database based on the EMBL ID number, resulting in 187 gene sequences. Fifteen probes per
sequence were designed for these using the same specifications as for the bacterial and viral target probes.
We designed ~2,600 random control sequences that
were length and GC% matched to the target probes on
MDA v.1 or v.2. These had no appreciable homology to
known sequences based on BLAST similarity, and were
used to assess background hybridization intensity. These
were designed by calculating the fraction f(L, g) of detection probes with length = L and GC% = g, and simulating
f(L, g) times the number of random probes desired random sequences of length L and GC% g for each L, g
observed in the detection probes. In addition, we also
included on the v.1 and v.2 arrays the 21,888 probes from
the ViroChip version 3 from University of California San
Francisco [4,14,24,29] downloaded from http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GPL3429. We note
that additional probe sets may be added to meet unique
needs of specific customers, not discussed further here.

strain Gomen (Adenoviridae), respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV) strain Long (Paramyxoviridae), respiratory syncytial virus strain B1, bluetongue virus (BTV) type 2 (Reoviridae) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) strain
Singer (Flaviviridae) were purchased from the National
Veterinary lab and grown at our laboratory. Purified
DNA from human herpesvirus 6B (HHV6B) (Herpesviridae) and vaccinia virus strain Lister (Poxviridae) were
purchased from Advanced Biotechnologies (Maryland,
VA). 11 blinded viral culture samples were received
from Dr. Robert Tesh’s lab at University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB). The viral cultures
were sent to LLNL in the presence of Trizol reagent.
After treatment with Trizol reagent, RNA from cells was
precipitated with isopropanol and washed with 70% ethanol. The RNA pellet was dried and reconstituted with
RNase free water. 1 μg of RNA was transcribed into double-strand cDNA with random hexamers using Superscript™ double-stranded cDNA synthesis kit from
Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). The DNA or cDNA was
labeled using Cy-3 labeled nonamers from Trilink Biotechnologies and 4 μg of labeled sample was hybridized to
the microarray for 16 hours as previously described (Jaing
et al., 2008). Clinical samples that had been extracted and
partially purified using Round A and Round B protocols
(Wang et al, 2003) were obtained from Dr. Joseph DeRisi’s
laboratory at University of California, San Francisco
(UCSF). The samples were amplified for an additional 15
cycles to incorporate aminoallyl-dUTP and labeled with
Cy3NHS ester (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The
labeled samples were hybridized to NimbleGen arrays.

were designed using either the KPATH system [30] or
based on the probes that gave a positive signal for the
organism identified as present, and the primer
sequences are proved as Additional file 1. PCR primers
were synthesized by Biosearch Technologies Inc
(Novato, CA). 1 μL of Round B material was re-amplified for 25 cycles and 2 μL of the PCR product was
used in a subsequent PCR reaction containing Platinum
Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), 200 mM primers for
35 cycles. The PCR condition is as follows: 96°C, 17 sec,
60°C, 30 sec and 72°C, 40 sec. The PCR products were
visualized by running on a 3% agarose gel in the presence of ethidium bromide.
Statistical analysis

For each array hybridization, we transformed the probe
intensities Iik (for probe i on an array hybridized to sample k) to binary values Y ik , representing whether I ik
exceeds an array-specific detection threshold. The
threshold was typically calculated as the 99th percentile
of the intensities of the negative control probes.
We developed simple logistic models to predict two
conditional probabilities: the probability of observing
Yik = 1 given the presence of a specific microbial target
in sample k, and the probability of observing Y ik = 1
given no complementary targets. The predictors for the
specific probability P(Yik = 1 | target j is present) were
derived by BLASTing probe i’s sequence against target
j’s genome, with an E-value threshold of 0.1, and choosing the highest scoring alignment for the probe-target
pair. The BLAST bit score Bij and the probe alignment
start position Q ij were extracted directly from the
BLAST output; the melting temperature Tij was computed according to the formula Tij = 69.4°C + (41 NGC 600)/L, where L is the length of the alignment and NGC
is the number of G or C bases in the alignment.
The entropy Si of the probe sequence trimer distribution was computed by counting the numbers of occurrences nAAA, nAAC, ..., nTTT of the 64 possible trimers in
the probe sequence, and dividing by the total number of
trimers, yielding the corresponding frequencies fAAA, ...,
fTTT. The entropy is then given by:
Si =

∑ −f

t

log 2 f t

t : f t ≠0

where the sum is over the trimers t with ft ≠ 0. We
estimate the nonspecific signal probability with a logistic
model:
P(Yik = 1 | no target present)
=

1
1 + exp[−(a 0 + a1S i )]

Page 19 of 21

We then model the specific probe signal probability by
a logistic function in which the linear predictor combines both nonspecific and target-specific terms:
P(Yik = 1 | target j present)
=

1
1 + exp[−(a 0 + a1S j + a 2Tij + a 3Bij + a 4Q ij )]

To fit the parameters a0 through a4 in the above models, we ran array experiments using samples of viruses
and bacteria with known genome sequences, computed
the covariates Si, Tij, Bij, and Qij, and performed logistic
regression against the observed outcomes.
To apply this model to samples containing unknown
targets, we performed an exhaustive BLAST search for
every probe on the array against a comprehensive database of complete microbial genome sequences. We then
computed the covariates Bij, Tij, and Qij for each target
on the array, for all probes having significant BLAST
hits (E-value < 0.1) against the target.
The conditional probe signal probabilities are then
combined to compute a likelihood function for the presence of a particular target, given the observed probe
signals on an array. In the likelihood function, we
assume that the probe signals are independent of one
another, conditioned on the sample composition. Let X
= (X1, X2, ..., Xm) be a vector of target presence indicators, where Xj = 1 if target j is present and 0 if not. The
conditional likelihood of Xj given the observed data Y
can then be written:
L( X j ; Y ) =

∏ P(Y = 1 | X )∏ P(Y = 0 | X )
i

j

i :Yi =1

i :Yi =0

where the individual probe-target signal probabilities
are given by:
P(Yi = 1 | Xj) =
1
1 +e

(5)

−(a 0 + a1S i + X j (a 2 Tij + a 3 Bij + a 4 Q ij ))

When multiple targets may be present, an approximation is used to compute the probe signal probabilities:
P(Yi = 1 | X ) ≈ 1 −

∏

(6)

a 0 + a1S i + a 2 Tij + a 3 Bij + a 4 Q ij

Here we assume that the probability of obtaining a
negative signal for a probe depends only on the set of

Gardner et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:668
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/668

targets that are assumed to be present, and that we can
estimate the probability by multiplying the probabilities
conditioned on the presence of the individual targets.
To find a combination of target presence indicators
X that best explains the observed data, we use a greedy
algorithm to find a local maximum for the log-likelihood.
The algorithm is initialized by placing all candidate targets in an “unselected” list U, and creating an empty
“selected” list S. The following steps are then iterated
until the algorithm terminates:
1. Compute the conditional log-odds score lj for each
target j Î U:

j =

∑

i:Yi =1

+

log

P(Yi = 1 | X j = 1, X k = 1 ∀k ∈ S)
P(Yi = 1 | X j = 0, X k = 1 ∀k ∈ S)

P(Yi = 0 | X j = 1, X k = 1 ∀k ∈ S)

∑ log P(Y = 0 | X

i:Yi =0

i

j

= 0, X k = 1 ∀k ∈ S)

lj is the log of the ratio of the likelihood of the data, if
target j is added to S, to its likelihood if j is not added.
When this step is performed for the first time, the
selected list S will be empty, so the computed log-odds
score for target j will not be conditioned on the
presence of any other targets. We store this “initial” logodds score lj(i) for later display.
2. Choose the target j that yields the largest value of
lj, remove it from list U, and add it to the end of list S.
We store the value of this “final” score lj(f) for each target in S.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until there is no target in U
that yields a positive value for the conditional log-odds
score (i.e., that increases the log-likelihood).
The result of this analysis is an ordered series S of target genomes predicted to be present, together with a
pair of scores for each target in S. The initial score lj(i)
is its log-odds from the first iteration; that is, the log of
the ratio of the likelihood with target j present to the
likelihood with no targets present. The final score lj(f) is
the contribution of target j to the log likelihood at the
time that it was selected, assuming the presence of all
the targets that were selected prior to j.
The analysis algorithm is implemented in the Python
language, except for plotting which is performed using
the R programming environment. The software is available on request from the authors.
