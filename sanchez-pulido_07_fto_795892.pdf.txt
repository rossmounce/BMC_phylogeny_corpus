Abstract
Background: Genetic variants in the FTO (fat mass and obesity associated) gene have been
associated with an increased risk of obesity. However, the function of its protein product has not
been experimentally studied and previously reported sequence similarity analyses suggested the
absence of homologs in existing protein databases. Here, we present the first detailed
computational analysis of the sequence and predicted structure of the protein encoded by FTO.
Results: We performed a sequence similarity search using the human FTO protein as query and
then generated a profile using the multiple sequence alignment of the homologous sequences.
Profile-to-sequence and profile-to-profile based comparisons identified remote homologs of the
non-heme dioxygenase family.
Conclusion: Our analysis suggests that human FTO is a member of the non-heme dioxygenase
(Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases) superfamily. Amino acid conservation
patterns support this hypothesis and indicate that both 2-oxoglutarate and iron should be
important for FTO function. This computational prediction of the function of FTO should suggest
further steps for its experimental characterization and help to formulate hypothesis about the
mechanisms by which it relates to obesity in humans.

Background
Two recent reports [1,2] characterized the strong association of a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in intron 1 of the human FTO gene with an
increased risk of obesity, characterized by an increase in
body max index due to fat mass rather than lean mass that
is seen in children as early as age seven [2].
However, the mechanisms by which this genetic variability relates to obesity remain obscure. These publications
indicate that the function of FTO is unknown [2] and that
its protein has no identified structural domain or link to

other proteins that could be used to predict its function
[1]. Knowledge of the function of FTO is crucial to guide
the search for a mechanism relating this gene to obesity.
Here we report evidence obtained by computational analysis indicating that the protein coded by FTO is a member
of the non-heme dioxygenase (Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutaratedependent dioxygenases) superfamily.

Results and Discussion
In the course of the computational characterization of the
FTO family (see Methods) we identified sequences

homologous to human FTO in different eukaryote groups
including vertebrates (from fish to mammals), green algae
(Ostreococcus) and diatoms (Phaeodactylum and Thalassiosira) (see Figure 1 and Table 1).
Using sequence profiles of the N-terminal conserved
region of the FTO family (corresponding to the human
FTO sequence amino acid positions 57–324) members of
the non-heme dioxygenase family were identified. Additionally, the secondary structure predictions of the FTO
family showed high similarity with the known structures
of AlkB, a member of the non-heme dioxygenase family
[3-5]. We were not able to find significant homology in
the C-terminal of the FTO family to other genes.
To investigate if fold recognition analysis would generate
supporting results, we submitted the FTO N-terminal
region as a query to an independent fold assignment system based on profile-profile comparisons (see Methods).
The profiles generated for the human and E. coli AlkB proteins (PDB entries 2iuw and 2fdi) matched the FTO N-terminal region with an E-Value of 3.2 × 10-21 and 3.1 × 1012, respectively (estimated error rate < 3%) despite their
low level of sequence identity to the human FTO protein
(approximately 17%). The next match corresponded to
the hypothetical protein TM0957 from Thermotoga maritima, however it was considered unreliable given its short
length (28 amino acids) and high E-value (0.02).
Given the E-values of the HMMer searches, the reliability
of secondary structure predictions, and the fold assignment results, we are confident that the proteins of the FTO
family (including the protein coded by the FTO human
gene) are members of the non-heme dioxygenase superfamily.
Proteins of this superfamily catalyze different oxidative
reactions on multiple substrates producing varied biological effects [6] and are characterized by a number of conserved amino acids involved in the binding of iron and 2oxoglutarate (as a cofactor and co-substrate, respectively).
We found these amino acids in human FTO and in its
homologs (see Figure 1 and Table 1), suggesting that 2oxoglutarate and iron are essential for the normal function of the FTO protein.
The FTO family is not a unique case as other families of
the non-heme dioxygenase superfamily are also very
divergent and their detection required non-trivial computational analysis [3]. Due to the divergence of the FTO
family from already known non-heme dioxygenases, we
were unable to predict the target of the family's catalytic
action.

The ubiquitous expression of FTO throughout many
human tissues [1] indicates that it has an important function. The phylogenetic distribution of FTO homologs
(consistently present in organisms from fish to mammals)
suggests that this gene appeared during the evolution of
vertebrates. Intriguingly, FTO homologs can be found in
green algae Ostreococcus and diatoms, whereas they are
apparently absent in insects, worms and fungi (see Figure
1 and Table 1). The most parsimonious explanation of
this fact is the existence of independent events of horizontal gene transfer from vertebrates to protists. Horizontal
gene transfer has previously been related to the evolution
of several eukaryotic regulatory systems that function in
development, differentiation and apoptosis [7]. Concisely, horizontal transfer of FTO indicates that the FTO
protein has a function that confers a selective advantage
but that it is not indispensable, which agrees with a possible regulatory role.
For comparison, the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), a
known member of the non-heme dioxygenase family,
also has a wide phylogenetic distribution (from worms to
mammals) and is ubiquitously expressed in all human tissues. HIF acts as a sensor of oxygen level and affects the
expression of over one hundred genes [8]. This molecule
performs its activity by shuttling between the cytoplasm
in normoxic conditions and the nucleus in hypoxic conditions [9].
To investigate if FTO could be acting in a similar manner,
we studied its sequence using an algorithm for prediction
of protein cellular localization (WolfPSORT; [10]). The
results suggested with similar scores a cytoplasmic and a
nuclear-cytoplasmic localization for this protein. This is
consistent with human FTO's possible function as a metabolic sensor and nuclear effector.
The FTO human gene product has a predicted molecular
mass of 50 KDa. With that mass it would need a Nuclear
Localization Signal (NLS) [11] in order to act in the
nucleus. Analysis of FTO's sequence using an algorithm
that includes the prediction of NLS (PSORTII; [10]) suggested a 17 amino acid long bipartite NLS from positions
2 to 18 (Figure 2A) noted previously [12] but not experimentally verified. Further analysis of the family indicated
that this region stands as a K/R rich region in comparison
to the rest of the sequence, and that it is located in an Nterminal extension that is conserved in close human
homologs from fish to mammals but not in the other FTO
homologues we found in algae or diatomea.
In light of these computational results we hypothesize
that FTO is a sensor of the cell's metabolic state and when
dysfunctional can result in an obese phenotype. We identify the N-terminal of human FTO as having a high likeli-

Computational analysis of the FTO family. Top. Multiple sequence alignment of the FTO family with known members of
the non-heme dioxygenase superfamily. Red triangles above the alignment mark the conserved residues involved in iron and 2oxoglutarate (2OG) binding with numbers indicating their position in AlkB. The numbers within the red box represent
sequence insertions that we did not include in the alignment. X-Ray determined secondary structure of AlkB (PDB code 2fdi)
[5] and hABH3 (PDB code 2iuw) [4] are shown below their sequences. PHD secondary structure prediction [26] for the FTO
family is included below the human FTO sequence. The alignment was produced using a combination of T-COFFEE [17] and
profile-to-profile alignment [24], using the structure-based superposition hABH3/AlkB alignment [28] as reference. Finally, the
alignment was slightly refined manually. It was represented with the program Belvu [18] with a coloring scheme indicating average BLOSUM62 score (correlated to amino acid conservation) in each alignment column: dark red (greater than 3), violet
(between 3 and 1) and light yellow (between 1 and 0.3). The sequences are named with their SwissProt or SpTrembl identifiers. Species abbreviations: Azovi, Azotobacter vinelandii; Caucr, Caulobacter crescentus; Comte, Comamonas testosteroni; Ecoli,

interpretation of the results.

Conclusion
Here we have provided valuable information about FTO
by indicating its possible catalytic function, and we have
pointed to the amino acids involved in cofactor (Fe) and
co-substrate (2-oxoglutarate) binding in human FTO as
well as in its homologous proteins in other organisms,
which could be used as models for the study of the human
disease. This insight should help to guide experiments to
clarify the mechanisms by which FTO relates to obesity
and to accelerate the discovery of novel molecular therapies for this condition.

Fold recognition analyses were performed using profileto-profile comparisons of the HMM profile of the FTO
family to profiles generated for each sequence of known
structure with its homologues (HHpred server; [23,24]).
The significance of sequence-to-sequence, profile-tosequence, and profile-to-profile matches were evaluated
in terms of an E-value, which is an estimation of the probability of finding a better match by chance. Secondary
structure predictions were performed using the PredictProtein Server [25,26]. AlkB active center illustrations
(Figure 1. Bottom) were generated with Pymol [27].

We first performed BLAST sequence similarity searches
[13] using the human FTO protein as query against different sequence database resources: NCBI [14], ENSEMBL
[15] and JGI [16]. Multiple sequence alignments of protein sequences homologous to human FTO were generated with the program T-Coffee [17] using default
parameters, slightly refined manually and visualized with
the Belvu program (Figure 1. Top) [18].
