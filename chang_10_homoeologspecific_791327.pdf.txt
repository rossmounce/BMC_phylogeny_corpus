Homoeolog-specific retention and use in
allotetraploid Arabidopsis suecica depends on
parent of origin and network partners

Abstract
Background: Allotetraploids carry pairs of diverged homoeologs for most genes. With the genome doubled in
size, the number of putative interactions is enormous. This poses challenges on how to coordinate the two
disparate genomes, and creates opportunities by enhancing the phenotypic variation. New combinations of alleles
co-adapt and respond to new environmental pressures. Three stages of the allopolyploidization process - parental
species divergence, hybridization, and genome duplication - have been well analyzed. The last stage of
evolutionary adjustments remains mysterious.
Results: Homoeolog-specific retention and use were analyzed in Arabidopsis suecica (As), a species derived from A.
thaliana (At) and A. arenosa (Aa) in a single event 12,000 to 300,000 years ago. We used 405,466 diagnostic features
on tiling microarrays to recognize At and Aa contributions to the As genome and transcriptome: 324 genes lacked
Aa contributions and 614 genes lacked At contributions within As. In leaf tissues, 3,458 genes preferentially
expressed At homoeologs while 4,150 favored Aa homoeologs. These patterns were validated with resequencing.
Genes with preferential use of Aa homoeologs were enriched for expression functions, consistent with the
dominance of Aa transcription. Heterologous networks - mixed from At and Aa transcripts - were
underrepresented.
Conclusions: Thousands of deleted and silenced homoeologs in the genome of As were identified. Since
heterologous networks may be compromised by interspecies incompatibilities, these networks evolve co-biases,
expressing either only Aa or only At homoeologs. This progressive change towards predominantly pure parental
networks might contribute to phenotypic variability and plasticity, and enable the species to exploit a larger range
of environments.

Background
An allotetraploid is formed when diploids from two different species, which may have diverged for millions of
years, hybridize. The resulting plant, if viable, might
have a competitive edge, such as broader ecological tolerance compared to its parents [1-3]. The evolutionary
importance of polyploidy, of which allotetraploidy is a
common form, is reflected in its prevalence in flowering
plants [4]: ancient polyploidy is apparent in all plant
genomes sequenced to date and is estimated to have
been involved in 15% of all plant speciation events [5].

Furthermore, most cultivated crops have undergone
polyploidization during their ancestry [5,6]. Why are
polyploids so evolutionarily, ecologically, and agriculturally successful? To answer this question, one has to
consider the evolutionary and genetic processes acting
at different stages of polyploidization.
Allopolyploidization can be characterized by four distinct stages. Stage 1 is the divergence between parental
species, with both species adapting to specific environments and adopting their own mating strategies and
reproductive schedules. Directional selection can contribute to the fixation of species-specific beneficial mutations
in coding and regulatory regions [7,8], while slightly deleterious mutations are introduced due to drift. In stages 2
and 3, the diverged species hybridize and increase ploidy,

with the two events sometimes reversed in order [9]. This
change in ploidy enables the correct pairing at meiosis.
Hybridization frequently results in phenotypic instability,
widespread genomic rearrangements, epigenetic silencing,
and unusual splicing [3,10-25]. Newly created polyploids
often experience rapid intragenomic adjustments. Stages 2
and 3 are well-studied with artificial polyploids constructed in the laboratory [10,12-17,19,22-24] or spontaneously arising in nature [14,26].
Stage 4 is the long term evolution of homoeologous
genes (that is, homologous genes from two parents
joined into one polyploid genome and stably inherited).
This stage occurs much slower on the evolutionary
time-scale and has received considerably less attention,
perhaps due to several technical limitations. Sequence
analyses have historically required extensive cloning and
bioinformatics. Microarrays have had to be specifically
designed to distinguish between homoeologs and orthologs. Interesting patterns have been reported, but typically for a few genes [14,27-29]. Notably, the retention
and expression of homoeologs is frequently biased
towards one parental species. These patterns were
reported on a large scale for approximately 1,400 out of
42,000 genes in cotton [30-32], and for dozens in Tragopogon [33]. Recent studies have also discovered abundant genetic variation among independently originated
or evolved accessions of Tragopogon [34-36]. What
molecular evolutionary processes account for this variation among accessions? How does intraspecific variation
in polyploid genomes contribute to phenotypic variation? These questions remain wide open.
Here, we focus on Arabidopsis suecica (As), a highly
selfing species [37] found mainly in central Sweden and
southern Finland [38]. As originated 12,000 to 300,000
years ago (KYA) from a cross between a largely homozygous ovule-parent Arabidopsis thaliana (At, 2n10)
and a pollen-parent Arabidopsis arenosa (Aa, 2n = 16)
[39-41]. A single origin of As (2n = 26) has been established with mitochondrial, chloroplast, and nuclear
DNA [39-41]. As originated south of the ice cover and
spread north when the ice retreated 10,000 years ago
[39]. At is an annual, weedy, and mostly autogamous
species native to Europe and central Asia but naturalized worldwide [42]. It has undergone at least two
rounds of ancient polyploidization [26] and is annotated
with 39 thousand genes. Aa is a self-incompatible member of the Arabidopsis genus, carrying the highest level
of genetic diversity among the species group [43]. At
and Aa diverged approximately 5 million years ago [44].
One can generate an artificial F1 allotetraploid (F1As) in
the lab by performing a cross between a tetraploid At
ovule-parent and a tetraploid Aa pollen donor. The resulting primary species hybrid contains two genomes from At
and two from Aa. We can use this as an estimate, as the

exact haplotypes that contributed to the initial hybridization event are not available, of the genomic composition
and homoeolog-specific expression at the time of allopolyploid speciation [24,45,46]. Taking these patterns as reflective of the As ancestral state, we observed how evolution
has shaped the As genome. As At is a selfer and Aa an
outcrosser, At-originated homoeologs might have possessed more deleterious mutations due to Hill-Robertson
interference [47]. Are Aa-originated homoeologs more
commonly retained? At and Aa evolved orthologous networks in which genes were finely tuned to coordinate,
separately within each species. Interference of At and Aa
homoeologs may cause mis-regulation within mixed As
networks. This is akin to Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities [48]. Do heterologous networks evolve to restore
their original orthologous-like compositions? Here, we
address these and other questions.

Results
For every gene in As, we set to determine whether both At
and Aa homoeologs are present in the genome and
whether they are expressed evenly or in homoeolog-specific fashion [49]. With the genome-wide Arabidopsis tiling
microarray, we scanned the genomes of At, Aa, As, and
F1 As. We analyzed the transcriptome of As with tiling
arrays and validated results with Illumina resequencing.
We assembled a statistical pipeline to identify At and Aa
homoeolog-originated signals, and to estimate their contribution to the As populations of DNA and RNA.
Comparison of probe hybridization between parental
species, and between As and F1As

The Arabidopsis array features 3.2 million 25-base-long
probes tiled throughout the complete genome at a 35base distance. As these features are homologous to the
At reference, they should, on average, exhibit a lower
hybridization with Aa DNA. Probe intensities confirm
this expectation. Two typical examples are shown for
chromosomes 3 and 4 (Figures 1 and 2; see Additional
files 1, 2, 3,4, 5 and 6 for other examples). F1As signals
are a sharp intermediate between At and Aa. As shows
remarkable correspondence with F1As, with the exception of several extended regions. We hypothesize that
these regions correspond to historic losses of homoeologous chromosomal regions in As.
We mapped features onto the genes and compared intensities between As and F1As; 6,790 genes exhibited differential hybridization (Wilcoxon ranked sum test, false
discovery rate (FDR) <0.05). To identify large putative
alterations, we scanned for clusters containing at least 30
genes with a strong unidirectional bias (at least 27 with
the same bias, significant for at least 9 genes). We identified 39 clusters, encompassing 1,643 genes (Table 1).
Some clusters were due to differential abundance of

0.29 M, Chr3 0.30 M, Chr3 5.58 M, Chr3 21.60 M, and
Chr3 22.98 M - appeared free from this problem (Additional file 2 includes detailed information). Interestingly,
the region 1.60 M-1.78 M on chromosome 4 (Figure 1) is

coincident with the heterochromatic knob known to be
hypervariable in At [50]. The 22.98 M-23.46 M region of
chromosome 3 (Figure 2) looked like an At-homoeolog
deletion. These results show that tiling arrays can be a
useful tool for detecting copy number variation [51] and
large-scale alterations in the As genome. As these analyses
are based on non-normalized signals (between species),
they are likely error-prone for individual genes.

Pre−normalized intensity

To analyze the homoeolog-specific retention and expression of individual genes, we focused on 1,393,557 probes
mapping to coding regions using Bowtie [52]. Since Aa
and At sequences differ at 1 out of 20 bases, some 25base oligonucleotides designed for At are a perfect
match for Aa sequences. Whenever orthologous Aa
sequences mis-match to the At chip, this hybridization
is weakened (hereafter termed ‘diagnostic features’
(DFs)). Separately for every gene, we identified a scaling
factor based on probes with similar signatures of hybridization to normalize intensities between species. We
then identified homoeolog-specific DFs and only
retained those (405,466) robust over replicates (Figure
3). We could only follow 24,344 genes as the fastest-

evolving genes have too many DFs for normalization
(Additional file 3).
We tested for deviations from an equal representation
of the two homoeologs in the As genome [12,16,53]. As
a reference point, we used the F 1 As DNA in which
homoeologs are present at equal doses (Figure 1). For
each gene within the regions of putative alterations, we
tested for changes in a between As and F1As, where a
represents the relative contribution of Aa DF hybridization strengths in a hybrid genome. There was an upward
shift in a in As compared to F1As (one-sided paired ttest, P < 2e-17), suggesting a preferential retention of
homoeologs derived from the Aa parent (Figure 4). Supporting this, more genes were called Aa-like (614) than
At-like (324). This bias is significant, although moderate

compared to earlier studies [30-32,34-36]. This might
reflect a limited power of microarrays. For instance, we
analyzed 30 genes encoded by the mitochondria organelle known to be At-derived. Only one plastid-encoded
gene had enough DFs to be unambiguously classified,
and was biased towards maternal At, as expected.

DFs, respectively. Overall, we conclude that, over the
12,000 to 300,000 years, As has accumulated more deletions of At-originated homoeologs and uses the remaining At-originated homoeologs somewhat less (Table 2).
Genes physically clustered together might co-express
and co-evolve in transcript levels, as previously observed

Use of At and Aa homoeologs in As transcriptome

To identify homoeologous transcripts in As, we
extracted RNA from leaf tissues and processed microarrays with the SNP-detection protocols similar to above.
More than 49% of genes were called expressed, and
7,608 exhibited homoeolog-specific expression, with
3,458 and 4,150 exhibiting At-enriched and Aa-enriched

To validate the tiling array-based procedures above,
we prepared Illumina libraries and performed RNAsequencing of the As transcriptome. The Aa genome is
not yet assembled, but we identified 52 Aa genes from
GenBank and acquired an additional 50 genes from the

in flies [54]. To test whether biases in homoeolog-specific expression were concordant between nearby genes,
we calculated running averages of Δa along chromosomes (Figure 5), and found regions with clusters of Atenriched and Aa-enriched transcription.

UC Genome Center. We identified the orthologous At
genes for these Aa genes and mapped the Illumina
reads to both homologs. Nine genes did not contain any
reads that were mapped to either homolog. For 14
genes, reads only mapped to either the Aa or the At
reference. For the remaining genes, reads were aligned
to both homologs and clustered as either derived from
At or Aa (Figure 6). We consider the number of
uniquely mapped reads as a measure of homoeolog-specific expression. A strong correlation in Aa:At expression ratio between tiling arrays and the RNA-seq (R2 =
0.646, P < 5e-07) proves that both approaches work.
This concordance is very satisfactory (Figure 7) given
that RNA samples were extracted from independently
grown plants, and that microarray estimates are frequently noisy.
Network analyses of homoeolog-specific genes

The summary of the Gene Ontology analysis of genes
exhibiting homoeolog-specific retention and expression is
shown in Tables 3 and 4. The categories ‘cell communication’ and ‘signal transduction’ were underrepresented,
while ‘DNA repair’ and ‘response to DNA damage stimulus’ were overrepresented. Aa-enriched transcripts were
overrepresented in the ‘gene expression’ category, including subprocesses involved in transcription, translation,
RNA processing and gene silencing by miRNA.
Lastly, we considered homoeolog-specific expression in
the context of At transcriptional networks [55]. Of the
7,608 genes, connectedness estimates were available for
6,941 gene pairs. We tested whether bins of higher-connected gene pairs exhibited higher concordance of homoeolog-specific expression (Figure 8). The fraction of
concordant pairs was approximately 0.4 in low-connectedness bins, but increased to 0.8 for the high-connected
gene pairs (R2 = 0.47, P < 0.0001). We also partitioned

‘mixed’ group was significantly underrepresented in comparison with random expectation (c2 test, P < 6e-08).

Discussion
In allopolyploid speciation, two genomes that have
experienced long independent evolution are combined.
Their genomes were shaped in different ways in
response to the extrinsic environmental and intrinsic
lifestyle pressures. We focused on As, a species that
evolved 12 to 300 KYA from a single hybrid individual
formed from an ovule of At and a pollen of Aa. Orthologous genes of At and Aa have average sequence divergence of 5% [43], exhibit differences in tissue-specific
expression [10,24], and are located on five versus eight
chromosomes. The allotetraploid hybrid initially had low
fertility, if one can conclude this from the performance
of artificial hybrids in the lab. This fertility can be
restored through the complex interplay of genetic and
epigenetic processes [22]. Several groups have been fascinated with this rapid but complex process [10,22,24,
45,46,53,56-59]. We focus on the subsequent longerterm molecular evolution, by comparing an evolved natural As with an ‘unevolved’ F1As hybrid.
The summary of F1As unevolved patterns

F 1 As and its following generations are a model for
whole-genome rearrangements and gene expression.
Approximately one of ten cDNA amplified fragment
length polymorphism (AFLP) bands displayed patterns
that were non-additive between F1 As and its parental
species [16]. One percent of bands were not detected in
the parental species altogether [24]. For AFLP fragments
observed in the parents, homoeolog silencing was nearly
symmetrical: 4% of At versus 5% of Aa. These patterns
varied among tissues in a seemingly stochastic way.
There was also some variation among accessions. In
addition to AFLPs, Wang et al. [53] used spotted 70mer oligonucleotide arrays to compare gene expression
between At, Aa, and F1As. More than 15% of transcripts

had different levels between parental species. In F1As,
5% of genes deviated in expression level from the additive mid-parent expectation, with the majority being
repressed. Interestingly, 94% of these genes were more
strongly expressed in the At parent, with their levels of
expression in F1As resembling Aa [56,57]. In conclusion,
the levels of gene expression in F 1As more frequently
resemble those in Aa, although homoeologs seem to
have been used symmetrically and sometimes randomly.
Aa-specific phenotypes, such as flower morphology,
plant stature and long lifespan, are dominant in F1 As
(likewise, Arabidopsis lyrata phenotypes are dominant
in thaliana-lyrata hybrids [56,59]). These results were

confirmed and further detailed in very recent investigations [24,45,46].
Evolved As patterns

We found that in As, Aa homoeologs are more frequently retained and more actively transcribed than
their At counterparts. We hypothesize that these Aafavoring biases are not random, but rather represent a
signature of an evolutionary process. To explain these
patterns, we propose a concept of ‘homoeolog competition.’ Genes are subject to detrimental mutations at
approximately constant rates [47]. Purifying selection
removes these mutations with varying efficiencies

depending on the gene redundancy, dominance, and
other characteristics [6,21,60,61]. As some F1As homoeologs are functionally redundant, they should be progressively lost to mutations and deletions. From the initial
pool of homoeologs, natural selection would preferentially maintain those with a higher contribution to fitness.
In this sense, homoeologs ‘compete’. Despite stoichiometric constraints to maintain stable ratios of dosage
among genes [62], there is a well-documented shrinkage
of polyploid genomes over time [6,9,12,15,18,21,25,26], as
few genes are haploinsufficient [60].
Why would At-originated homoeologs be less valuable? Our first hypothesis is inspired by Hill and Robertson [60]. Selfing organisms, such as At, are less capable
of purging mildly deleterious mutations. This is because
of severely reduced recombination in comparison to
outcrossers, such as Aa [61,63,64]. This may seem paradoxical, as At maintains much less variation than Aa
[43], which one might interpret as mutations in Aa.
When selfing evolves, segregating mutations are quickly
purged, as they exhibit their deleterious nature in autozygous individuals. In the short term, selfers are in fact
better off [61]. With time, however, Mullers’ ratchet
kicks in one slightly deleterious mutation after another,
resulting in low standing variation but inferior functionality [47]. Selfing is typical of terminal branches on

phylogenetic trees, interpreted as being an evolutionary
dead-end [64,65]. Thus, Aa homoeologs may contribute
more to the fitness of an F1As, as they originate from an
outcrossing species. In the future, we will test this
hypothesis by population ‘allele-specific’ resequencing
and applying molecular evolution tests to homoeologs
separately.
Our second hypothesis involves historical factors. Suppose the southern-adapted At accession hybridized with
the northern-adapted Aa accession, and that the emerging As accession spent most of the 12,000 to 300,000
years in the northern environment [37,39]. Aa-originated homoeologs would be a better fit for the environment, would be more frequently retained, and would
evolve to be preferentially used [66]. To test this

model assumes a large standing variation in the genome
and transcriptome, which has been well-documented in
Tragopogon [35,36]. A more direct, rather than biogeographic-type, evidence might be obtained with Gossypium [14]. This species displays a similar strengthening
of parentally skewed expression when natural allotetraploids are compared with F1 allotetraploid controls.
Thirdly, recall that the Aa transcription machinery is
preferentially expressed in F1As [53]. Homoeologs preadapted to function under Aa transcriptional control
will then be selected for, reinforcing this initial pattern.
Homoeolog-specific methylation might be at the heart
of these processes [45,46]. Indirectly supporting this

Chang et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R125
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/12/R125

idea, Aa-like genes exhibited enrichment in the ‘gene
expression’ category (with subprocesses: transcription,
translation, RNA processing, and gene silencing by
miRNA). Recent reports in Arabidopsis and Brassica
allopolyploids indicate a high proportion of nonadditive
expression for genes within these categories as well
[53,67,68]. Similar results have also been shown in Senecio [69,70].
Resolving incompatibilities in allotetraploid networks

Imagine ancestral genes A1 and A2 that formed a functional dimer in the common ancestor of Aa and At 5
million years ago. These genes evolved into At1 and At2
orthologs in the At lineage, and into Aa1 and Aa2
orthologs in the Aa lineage. Within these lineages, At1
and At2 have been selected for the ability to form a
dimer. Likewise, co-evolution has been taking place
between Aa1 and Aa2 proteins [48]. In F1As, along with
the parental dimers At1-At2 and Aa1-Aa2, there will
also be heterologous At1-Aa2 and Aa1-At2 dimers. Are
these dimers likely to be functional [48]? Dobzhansky
and Muller hypothesized that some would not be [71].
Strongly decreased fitness of At × Aa F1 and F2 seeds,
and meiotic disruptions in F1’s, attest to the presence of
intrinsic incompatibilities contributing to the reproductive isolation of these two species, and some genes
involved have been characterized [61,62].
An allotetraploid might walk an evolutionary path to
fitness restoration by preferentially co-expressing only
one parental set of interacting homoeologs, with mixed
networks being less common. The data confirmed our
expectation that homoeologous networks in fact evolved
towards pure Aa or At profiles. This type of ‘D-M
homoeolog conflict resolution’ should be typical for
polyploid ancestors and might potentially contribute to
the fractionated genomes we observe today [9,72]. As
we now know the identity of networks having evolved
to a ‘pure’ parental type, our strong prediction is that
the experimenter-induced heterologous state in these
networks shall result in detectable reproductive losses.

Conclusions
When an allotetraploid is formed, the functions of
homoeologs are partially redundant, and the genome is
set for gene silencing and deletion. Thousands of
genes affected by these processes in As were identified
with tiling arrays and resequencing. These new computational approaches enable the use of widely available
and economical tiling microarrays for the whole-genome analyses of species closely related to the
sequenced references. In the As allotetraploid, more
At-originated homoeologs are lost and silenced than
Aa-originated homoeologs. We hypothesize that these

Page 12 of 17

Aa-favoring biases are not random, but rather represent a signature of an evolutionary process. Whenever
more than one gene experiences silencing within a network, the homoeolog bias of the first event influences
the likewise bias for the subsequent silencing; networks
evolve towards their ancestral types. The mosaics of
predominantly pure-parental networks in allotetraploids might contribute to phenotypic variability and
plasticity, and enable the species to exploit a larger
range of environments.

Materials and methods
Plant material, DNA and RNA extractions

Affymetrix GeneChip ® Arabidopsis Tiling 1.0R Arrays
were hybridized with samples from four different
sources. Genomic DNA was obtained from tetraploid At
accession Ler [73], tetraploid Aa accession Care-1 [58],
allotetraploid As accession Sue-1 [73], and an F1As produced by crossing the tetraploids At and Aa as maternal
and paternal parents, respectively [58]. cDNA was prepared from As leaf samples. All genomic DNA and
cDNA samples were hybridized in three biological replicates using standard protocols.
Sample Illumina library preparation

RNA purification, cDNA synthesis and Illumina library
construction was performed using the protocols of Mortazavi et al. [74] with the following modifications. Total
RNA, mRNA, and DNA were quantified using a Qubit
fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). mRNA
fragmentation was performed using Fragmentation
Reagent (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) and subsequently
cleaned through an RNA cleanup kit (Zymo Research,
Irvine, CA, USA). Additional DNA and gel purification
steps were conducted using Clean and Concentrator kits
(Zymo Research). Illumina sequences are available for
download at the NCBI Short Read Archive under the
accession SRA025958.
Microarray preprocessing and normalization

The Arabidopsis Tiling Microarray is composed of over
3.2 million probe pairs tiled throughout the complete At
genome. Probes are tiled at an average of 35 base pairs.
Affymetrix CEL files are available for download from
the public repository ArrayExpress under the accessions
E-MEXP-2968 and E-MEXP-2969. To ensure that arrays
within genotypes are comparable to each other, Robust
Multiarray Analysis [75,76] was implemented to perform
background correction. Intensities for three biological
replicates were summarized with quantile normalization
[77]. In addition, intensities for the three biological
replicates of As and F1As were summarized altogether
with quantile normalization. Consistency and density

plots may be found in the Additional files. PM probes
exhibited some mismatches for the At genotype, as this
array is based on a different reference; the arrays exhibited an additional lower hybridization intensity peak.
PM probes from conserved exon regions were much
more robust.
As expected from interspecific sequence divergence,
the number of Aa higher intensity probes decreased,
while the number of lower intensity probes increased.
Note, however, that ‘conservative features’ and ‘divergent
features’ peak at similar intensities in both species, making the analyses easier. Similar to At, Aa lower intensity
probes were overrepresented in non-coding regions.
Identifying As genomic regions with putative multi-gene
alterations

Probe intensities among three biological replicates in As
were averaged and paired with the corresponding average
among the three F1As replicates. For each gene, a paired
Wilcoxon rank-sum test (FDR <0.05) [78] of all probes
was used to identify genes with differential hybridization.
The significance of individual genes might be misleading,
but the pattern for multigene regions is robust. We
scanned for windows in which at least 27 (90%) out of 30
genes exhibited unidirectional stronger or unidirectional
weaker hybridization in As in comparison with F1As. We
also required these differences to be significant at FDR
<0.05 for at least 9 (30%) genes. Overlapping windows
were collapsed to identify the entirety of these regions.
Multi-genotype array normalization and identification of
diagnostic features

Our goal here is to select probe features enabling the
comparison of At and Aa signal representation in As
DNA and RNA. To enable cross-comparison of DNA
and RNA, the analyses have to be made gene-by-gene,
with DNA and RNA hybridization signals normalized to
the same level with each gene.
First, probes representing conserved signatures
between genotypes were identified and used to scale the
entire gene. For every probe in a gene, its average intensity among replicates in At was compared to the average
intensity in Aa. These ratios formed a unimodal distribution and the peak of this distribution was used as the
scaling factor for which to normalize between genotypes
for that gene. Mathematically, for probe i in the gene,
the average intensity among j biological replicates in
both genotypes is defined as:
Ai =

where aij and tij represent the probe intensities of the
jth replicate of the ith probe in Aa and At, respectively.
Defining Xi as:
Xi =

~ f (x)
Ai

The scaling factor, xmax is defined as:
x max = arg max f ( x )
x

The value for xmax was estimated using the mlv function in R, which calculates the kernel density and
searches for x that maximizes that estimated density
function. From hereon, we replace all a ij values with
rescaled values represented by product(xmax,aij). We disregarded genes whose f(x) failed the Shapiro-Wilks normality test. This normalization method is similar to one
recently outlined by Robinson and Oshlack [79], where
a scaling parameter is used to normalize between two
samples.
Second, we identified single feature polymorphisms or
DFs between At and Aa using a Welch t-test of log2transformed values, followed by controlling FDR to be
smaller than 0.05. These approaches enabled us to analyze homoeolog-specific retention in 24,344 out of
approximately 39,000 At genes.
Analysis of DFs in DNA samples from As

If an As gene retained both parental homoeologs, we
should observe an equal mix of At and Aa signals. A
linear model was used to determine whether As has
probe intensities within a gene contributed by i) both
parents (mixed), ii) parental At only (At-like), or iii) parental Aa only (Aa-like). For a gene with n DFs, the vector of intensities, S = [S1, S2,..., Sn], may be contributed
by corresponding Aa- and At-specific signals, such that
S = a1•A + b1•T and the contribution of Aa, a1, can
be estimated using a simple linear regression. Specifically:
S ij =  1 Ai +  1Ti +  ij

where i = 1,2,..,n, j = 1,2,3 for the three biological
replicates, and Ai and Ti are the mean intensities in Aa
and At, respectively. εij are error terms that are independent random variables from a normal distribution with
a mean 0 and variance s2. The strength of our experimental design is in F1As, in which a null model holds
true for genomic DNA. For F1As, this expectation is:
Fij =  2 Ai +  2Ti +  ij

To detect deviations from the null, we tested whether
a1 is significantly different from a2. Under the null

follows an F distribution with 1 and 6n - 1 degrees of
freedom. This assumption of a + b = 1 can be made
since the contributions of Aa and At are weighted. The
bias was labeled as Aa-like if a1 > a2 and as At-like if a1
< a2. To account for multiple testing issues arising from
thousands of genes tested, Benjamini-Hochberg’s FDR
was employed to adjust the significance level at 0.05 [78].
As with all linear regression models, we assume that
the error terms follow a normal distribution. We investigated this by applying a Shapiro-Wilks test on each gene
to ensure that they were normal. We removed over 7,000
genes that failed these tests. We found little discrepancy
for the results of the analyses when a1 was defined as the
At contribution. We also determined significance by performing a permutation test for each gene and found little
discrepancy with the F distribution shown above.
Analysis of DFs in As transcripts

Since we are estimating the relative contribution of Aa
rather than the absolute, the expression level of every

gene in the As transcriptome was normalized to identical hybridization levels with its corresponding genomic
DNA. This was done using probes representing conserved signatures, identified as previously described. We
then analyzed the homoeolog-specific expression with
the same linear model approach as above, using DFs
identified between RNA and DNA, and a found in As
DNA as the null reference point. When these intensities
of DFs are biased in one direction, we can determine
homoeolog-specific expression. Furthermore, for each
gene, a was estimated by regressing over all DFs in the
set, minimizing spurious effects of individual probes.
Forty-nine percent of genes were expressed. Distributions of intensities for conserved features in As DNA
and RNA prior to and after gene-wise normalization are
shown in the Additional files. The homoeolog-specific
expression was assayed in 18,876 genes.
Illumina data analysis

Pair-ended 72-base Illumina reads were aligned and
mapped allowing up to 10 mismatches using bwa [80] to
102 Aa transcript sequences and their orthologous At
sequences. A pairwise global alignment identified SNPs
and short insertion/deletion variants between orthologous Aa and At gene pairs. Reads that mapped to either
of the two orthologs were scanned for these variants to
ensure that they were clustered with the appropriate
ortholog (Figure 6). The number of reads mapped to
each ortholog was normalized to FPK (fragments per
kilobase of exon) to account for slightly variable sequence
length between orthologs. This analysis and its results are
summarized in Figures 6 and 7, and in Additional file 5.

Variation within Aa and At

Note that although extant accessions of Aa, At, and F1As
were used, As was formed 12 to 300 KYA, perhaps from
different accessions. DFs and Illumina resequencing may
potentially result in misleading conclusions. Nevertheless,
5 million years of sequence divergence between Aa and
At compares favorably with the smaller amount of standing sequence variation and with the unaccounted extra
divergence since As formation. From the above resequencing data, we estimated the divergence of the Aa homoeolog within As from the homologous gene in Aa.
Likewise, we estimated the divergence of the At homoeolog within As from the homologous gene in At. Consistent with high sequence variation in Aa [43], the
divergence from parental homologs is larger in Aa, as
sequence variation in natural At is very limited [42]. This
would result in fewer Aa-like calls, and lower biases
detected in this manuscript. Note that, as expected from
[66], stronger expressed genes appear more conserved
and exhibit lesser Aa and At divergences (Figure 9).
