Abstract
Background: The phosphoinositide (PIns) signalling pathway regulates a series of neuronal
processes, such as neurotransmitter release, that are thought to be altered in mood disorders.
Furthermore, mood-stabilising drugs have been shown to inhibit key enzymes that regulate PIns
production and alter neuronal growth cone morphology in an inositol-reversible manner. Here, we
describe analyses of expression and function of the recently identified H+/myo-inositol transporter
(HMIT) investigated as a potential regulator of PIns signalling.
Results: We show that HMIT is primarily a neuronal transporter widely expressed in the rat and
human brain, with particularly high levels in the hippocampus and cortex, as shown by
immunohistochemistry. The transporter is localised at the Golgi apparatus in primary cultured
neurones. No HMIT-mediated electrophysiological responses were detected in rat brain neurones
or slices; in addition, inositol transport and homeostasis were unaffected in HMIT targeted nullmutant mice.
Conclusion: Together, these data do not support a role for HMIT as a neuronal plasma membrane
inositol transporter, as previously proposed. However, we observed that HMIT can transport
inositol triphosphate, indicating unanticipated intracellular functions for this transporter that may
be relevant to mood control.

Background
Bipolar disorder is a severe psychiatric illness characterised by alternating episodes of mania and depression.
Dysregulation of the PIns signalling pathway has been
implicated in the pathophysiology of the disorder by
magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies [1]. Furthermore, commonly prescribed drugs used to treat the illness
(lithium, valproic acid and carbamazepine) alter neuronal growth cone morphology, a phenotype that is reversed
by addition of extracellular myo-inositol [2,3].
Brain inositol levels are regulated by: a) transport from
blood, b) recycling of intracellular inositol phosphates,
and c) synthesis from glucose-6-phosphate to myo-inositol-1-phosphate (MIP) by the enzyme MIP-synthase [4,5].
MIP-synthase expression in the brain appears to be confined to the vasculature [5], suggesting that inositol synthesis may not play a key role in neuronal inositol
signalling. Rather, an uptake system seems to be required
to transport inositol across the plasma membrane into
neurones, which may play a role in the regulation of signalling. Three myo-inositol transporters have been identified to date – the sodium myo-inositol transporters 1 and
2 (SMIT1 and SMIT2) [6] and the phylogenetically distant
H+/myo-inositol transporter (HMIT) [7]. mRNA expression studies identified HMIT, but not SMIT1 or SMIT2,
transcripts in rat neurones [3]. Also, HMIT expression
appears highest in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex,
areas which are implicated in mood disorders [8].
HMIT is a glycosylated protein containing three conserved
internalisation signals: an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
retention signal in the N-terminal region, a dileucine
internalisation signal and a tyrosine based internalisation
motif at the C-terminal [7]. Mutation of the retention signals is required for plasma membrane localisation of the
recombinant protein in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian
cells, and this surface localisation correlated with functional inositol uptake into the cells [7]. Furthermore,
HMIT is a symporter of myo-inositol and protons, since
inositol uptake was only evident under acidic extracellular
conditions and was associated with an inward electrical
current and decreased intracellular pH [7]. It has been
proposed that translocation of recombinant or endogenous HMIT to the plasma membrane may be activitydependent following, for example, neuronal depolarisation or protein kinase C (PKC) activation [8].
Whilst HMIT represents an attractive candidate as a neuronal inositol transporter, it is unclear if HMIT contributes
to the inositol-reversible effects of mood stabilisers on
neurones [2] through transport of inositol into the cell. To
address this question, we undertook studies to further
characterise the localisation and functional properties of
HMIT in recombinant systems and native tissue. We have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/10/54

analysed HMIT expression in rat and human brain tissue
using immunohistochemistry and investigated the conditions necessary for its translocation to the plasma membrane in heterologous cells and cultured neurones.
Functional expression was probed using [3H]-myo-inositol
uptake, [3H]-cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDPDAG) accumulation and whole-cell electrophysiology
assays.

Results
Intracellular myo-inositol measurements in rat cortical
neurones
To determine if extracellular myo-inositol can be taken up
by neurones, we measured intracellular myo-inositol concentrations following incubation of cultured neurones
with myo-inositol (1 mM) for 2 min or 20 h. After cell
supernatant removal, cells were washed with ice-cold
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with ice-cold
acetonitrile containing ammonium acetate; intracellular
myo-inositol concentration was measured using liquid
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
Intracellular inositol levels were found to be significantly
increased after overnight extracellular application (19.25
± 0.84 vs 2.33 ± 0.38 μM, mean ± sem; ***p < 0.001; Figure 1A), indicating that inositol can be taken up across the
plasma membrane. Intracellular inositol concentration
was not changed after 2 min incubation (3.43 ± 0.26 vs
2.33 ± 0.38 μM, mean ± sem; p = 0.07, one-way ANOVA
followed by Dunnett's post-hoc test; Figure 1A). We subsequently proceeded to investigate whether HMIT is
involved in the transport of myo-inositol into neurones by
studying its expression and function.
HMIT expression in the brain
In order to analyse HMIT localisation, we generated a specific antibody, as demonstrated by Western blotting,
immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry (see
Additional files 1 and 2). The cellular specificity and localisation of HMIT was analysed by confocal microscopy of
rat primary cortical cultures co-stained with anti-HMIT:21
antibody and either a neuronal, astrocytic or Golgi
marker. We observed no co-localisation of HMIT and the
astrocytic marker GFAP (Figure 1B), indicating little or no
expression of HMIT in primary astrocytes, which are a cell
contaminant in the neuronal preparation. The images in
Figure 1C show that HMIT co-localised with βIII tubulin
in the cell body and neurites, indicating neuronal expression. Furthermore, the HMIT antibody co-localised with
the Golgi marker 58K Golgi protein (Figure 1D), suggesting that HMIT is present in an intracellular compartment
associated with the Golgi apparatus.

To investigate HMIT localisation in the rat brain, immunohistochemistry was performed in sagittal slices from
adult rat brain with staining visualised using the Odyssey

imaged using a confocal microscope with a 63× water immersion objective.

infra-red detection system (Li-Cor) (see Additional file 1).
Staining was observed in the hippocampal region, with
high expression levels of the HMIT protein in CA2-3 and
dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (see Additional file 3).
In addition, the immunising peptide effectively competed
with the observed signal in rat brain (data not shown).
Subsequently, fluorescence and colorimetric immunohistochemistry were performed to investigate the detailed
anatomical and cellular distribution of HMIT-like immunoreactivity (HMIT-LI) in rat and human brain. HMIT-LI
appeared to be distributed in discrete regions of the rat
brain with a strong expression in the hippocampus, particularly in the CA2-3 regions and in the dentate gyrus
(Figure 2C). Moderate HMIT expression was observed in
the cerebral motor cortex (Figure 2A and 2B). In the
human brain, a moderate to high HMIT-LI signal was
detected in the cerebral cortex (Figure 2D) and hippocampus (Figure 2E). As shown in Figure 2B (rat) and in Figure
2F (human) the HMIT-LI seems to be localised predominantly intracellularly.
Analysis of HMIT triple mutant
We first studied and characterised HMIT function using
the HMIT triple mutant (generated as described by [7]). It
was previously shown that recombinant HMIT is localised
in the cytoplasm of HEK293 cells and that expression of
an HMIT triple mutant was required to achieve plasma

membrane localisation [7]. In order to confirm and
extend these findings, we transfected HEK293 cells with
pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO-HMIT triple mutant and analysed HMIT localisation by immunocytochemistry using
the anti-HMIT:21 antibody and an anti-pan cadherin antibody to confirm plasma membrane localisation (Figure
3A). HMIT triple mutant co-localised with pan-cadherin
staining, indicating that the HMIT triple mutant is
expressed at the plasma membrane, in contrast to the
wild-type recombinant HMIT. In the [3H]-inositol uptake
assay using HEK293T cells transfected with the HMIT triple mutant, inositol uptake activity was observed at pH
6.0 and this was partially reversed by treatment with the
non-selective inhibitor phloridzin (53 ± 1.4% inhibition
with 1 mM phloridzin, 89 ± 1.5% inhibition with 3 mM
phloridzin; n = 2 independent experiments). In contrast,
the activity measured at pH 7.4 was much lower (100 ±
1.1 fmol at pH 6.0 versus 8.8 ± 0.26 fmol at pH 7.4; n = 2
independent experiments) (Figure 3B). These data indicate that the HMIT triple mutant is expressed at the
plasma membrane and is functional at pH 6.0.
HMIT activity was further analysed using patch-clamp
electrophysiology. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings
were made from EGFP-positive HEK293 cells transiently
co-transfected with the HMIT triple mutant and EGFP
plasmids. Myo-inositol (2 mM) was applied by fast per-

fusion for 10 s at 60 s intervals under various conditions.
At the holding potential of -60 mV, no current responses
were observed at extracellular pH 7.4 (Figure 3C). However, when the extracellular pH was 5.2, myo-inositol
evoked an inward, non-desensitising current. This
response was independent of extracellular Na+ and
showed weak voltage-dependence (data not shown). The
magnitude of the inositol-evoked currents increased as the
extracellular environment was further acidified and
reached a plateau level between pH 6 and pH 5 (Figure
3C). Characterising the concentration-response relationship of myo-inositol gave an EC50 of 2.7 mM, with a Hill
slope of 1.0 (n = 5–9 per data point; Figure 3C). This contrasts with the affinity constant (Km) of 100 μM as
reported by Uldry et al. (2001) using oocytes. In this
study, the inositol-evoked currents were sensitive to inhibition by phloridzin (1 mM; 64.0 ± 3.1% inhibition, n =
4) and a similar level of inhibition was also observed in
the absence of extracellular Na+ (48.0 ± 6.7% inhibition,
n = 4; data not shown). In addition we investigated
whether inositol triphosphate (IP3) is also a substrate for
HMIT. In HEK293T cells transiently transfected with the
HMIT triple mutant, application of IP3 (0.1 mM) did not
generate any responses at pH 7.4. When the extracellular
pH was set at 5.2, application of IP3 evoked an outward
current (+91 ± 20 pA, n = 4) while myo-inositol (2 mM)
induced a current of opposite polarity (-120 ± 20 pA, n =
8; Figure 3D). The opposite direction of the net current
can be explained by the negatively charged IP3 compared
with the neutral inositol molecule. We confirmed that
these responses were mediated by the HMIT triple mutant
as no currents were observed at pH 5.2 when the experiment was repeated using HEK293T cells transfected with
EGFP only as a control (IP3, -0.7 ± 1.8 pA, n = 5; myoinositol, -0.1 ± 0.9 pA, n = 5).
HMIT-mediated currents in rat neurones
Following characterisation of the HMIT triple mutant, we
investigated rat brain tissue for endogenous HMIT-mediated responses. Whole-cell recordings (holding potential 60 mV) were carried out in cultured cortical neurones and
to ensure HMIT was not unknowingly inhibited, we did
not include tetrodotoxin (TTX) to block spontaneously
occurring synaptic currents. At both extracellular pH 7.4
and 5.7, applications of myo-inositol (5 mM) did not
evoke any current responses (0.3 ± 0.8 pA, -0.1 ± 0.7 pA,
respectively; n = 6; Figure 4A).

Our localisation data showed HMIT staining in interneurones of the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus
(Figure 2C arrowhead). To test for HMIT function in these
cells, we made whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in
acute rat hippocampal slices and applied myo-inositol (10
mM) onto the cell bodies by micro-pressure application.
As illustrated in Figure 4B, we found no inositol-evoked

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/10/54

currents in interneurones located in the CA3 stratum radiatum, CA3 stratum lacunosum-moleculare or CA1 stratum
lacunosum-moleculare. To test if neuronal activity is
required for HMIT translocation to the plasma membrane, we stimulated the slices using various conditions
and found no current responses on application of myoinositol (Figure 4C). These data obtained in rat dissociated neurones as well as in rat slices suggest that functional HMIT is not present at the plasma membrane of the
soma.
Inositol studies in HMIT null-mutant neurones
We further investigated the functional expression of HMIT
in cultured neurones using the [3H]-CDP-DAG accumulation assay by comparing wild-type (WT) and HMIT nullmutant (KO) mice. Cells were stimulated with the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol (CCh) to activate PIns
signalling, and treated with LiCl to block the enzyme
inositol monophosphatase, therefore reducing intracellular inositol with the consequent accumulation of CDPDAG. [3H]-CDP-DAG accumulation was measured in cortical neurones from WT and KO mice (Figure 5). Application of extracellular myo-inositol clearly reversed [3H]CDP-DAG accumulation, at physiological pH in WT neurones. No difference was observed between WT and HMIT
null-mutant neurones, thus indicating that inositol enters
the cell despite genetic ablation of HMIT (see Additional
files 1 and 4) [9].

Discussion
In this study we show that HMIT is a neurone-specific protein that is widely expressed in the brain. The brain distribution is supported by the data from the Allen Mouse
Brain Atlas http://www.brainatlas.org and Northern blot
analysis [7]. The cellular localisation data obtained in the
present study, however, contrast with that reported by
Uldry et al. [7] which suggested widespread astrocytic
localisation. The latter is inconsistent with our immunohistochemical data and also the QPCR data of Cahoy et al.
[10], which suggest a neuronal expression (up to mouse
postnatal day 30). The discrepancy may be explained by
the relative specificity of the antibodies used in the two
studies. We confirmed antibody specificity for HMIT
using a series of methods including tagged-HMIT and
peptide competition assays. Intracellular localisation was
investigated both in vitro in primary neurones and ex vivo
in rat brain sections. We showed that HMIT is co-localised
with a Golgi marker and is not present at the cell surface
or in neuronal processes. The Golgi localisation data support findings by [7,8], who observed intracellular staining
as demonstrated by co-localisation with the intracellular
ER marker calreticulin. We also demonstrated HMIT
expression in several regions of the human brain by
immunohistochemistry, with the signal being consistent
with an intracellular localisation.

[3H]-CDP-DAG accumulation increased with time in WT

There was no difference in the reversal of [3H]-CDP-DAG
accumulation in WT (black dashed lines) and HMIT KO (grey

Overall, our study has shown that HMIT is expressed at
the plasma membrane and is able to transport inositol (at
pH 6.0 or below) but only under artificial conditions
whereby it lacks intracellular retention motifs. In contrast,
the native protein has secondary structural features consistent with intracellular localisation and retention and
immunocytochemical analysis confirms its localisation in
the ER/Golgi network. We could not demonstrate any
activity-dependent inositol transport in vitro or ex vivo in
neurones. These data suggest that HMIT is not involved in
the neuronal transport of inositol from the extracellular
environment and the mechanism underlying this process
remains to be identified.

Methods
All chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were purchased
from Sigma.

In agreement with previous studies, triple mutant HMIT is
localised at the plasma membrane when overexpressed in
HEK293 cells. The triple mutant was functional, as shown
by both electrophysiology and inositol uptake assays, and
we confirmed the characteristics of HMIT inositol transport – pH dependence, sodium independence, phlorizidin sensitivity – first reported by Uldry et al. [7]. We
extended our analysis to rat primary neurones and hippocampal tissue slices where we were unable, even after
stimulation, to demonstrate inositol-induced currents.
We recognised that as pressure application of inositol was
aimed at the soma we cannot exclude that translocation of
HMIT may occur further away in the processes. However,
in our localisation studies there was clear staining in the
soma with no indication that HMIT is enriched in the
processes. We used acutely prepared brain slices and primary dissociated neurones in contrast to Uldry et al.
(2004) who showed translocation in rat brain aggregates,
and preferential expression in regions of nerve growth and
varicosities in primary neurones overexpressing recombinant HMIT. The lack of stimulation-induced HMIT
activity was unlikely to be due to insufficient time course
as translocation of HMIT was observed after 10 min application of PMA by [8], while we did not observe inositolinduced currents even after 30–60 min stimulation of
slices. Although experiments were performed at room
temperature, we did not observe any difference when
slices were incubated at 30°C for more than 2 h suggesting that function was not affected by lower temperature.

Plasmids
The plasmids used were pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) containing rat wild-type or rat HMIT triple mutant
DNAs, all generated at GlaxoSmithKline. HMIT was
cloned in frame with the V5-His tags by deleting the stop
codon. The triple mutant, as described previously [7], was
generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange® Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene)
following manufacturer's instructions.

Our data on localisation and function suggest that HMIT
is not a plasma membrane transporter. The novel observation that HMIT can also transport IP3 provides an interest-

HMIT antibody generation
Rabbit polyclonal affinity purified antibody anti-HMIT
#21 (anti-HMIT:21) was produced by Open Biosystems.

All animal experimental procedures were performed
according to either the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures)
Act of 1986 or according to the Italian law (art. 7, Legislative Decree No. 116, 27 January 1992), which acknowledged the European Directive 86/609/EEC, and
GlaxoSmithKline policy on the care and use of laboratory
animals and related codes of practice. All efforts were
made to minimise the number of animals used.
All human material used in this research was collected
and used in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki
and in accordance with any relevant laws. In all cases

The following conserved peptide (human, rat and mouse)
coupled to KLH was chosen: RWLIQKGQTQKARRILS [rat
accession number AJ315643], which is located in the
intracellular loop between transmembrane domains 6
and 7.
Cell culture and transient transfection
Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured
in MEM (Invitrogen), 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum
(FBS) (Invitrogen), 1% (v/v) MEM non-essential aminoacids (Invitrogen), 2% (v/v) L-glutamine (Invitrogen).

Cells were seeded at 30,000–50,000 cells per well (in 24well plate format) or at 200,000 cells per well (in 6-well
plate format) and grown for 24 h before transfection using
Fugene 6 (Roche) according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells were fixed or lysed 48 h post-transfection.
Rat and mouse cortical neurone preparation
Cortical neurones were cultured from gestational day 18
rat foetal tissue of Sprague Dawley rats [9] or gestation day
15 mouse foetal tissue. Briefly, cerebral cortices were collected in Hank's balanced salts solution, the meninges
removed, and cortex dissected and dissociated with a
papain tissue dissociation kit (Worthington) following
the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were resuspended
in Neurobasal medium (it contains 40 μM inositol) containing 2% (v/v) B27 supplement, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 50 μg/
ml streptomycin (media components from Invitrogen).
Rat hippocampal slice preparation
Sprague-Dawley rats (postnatal day (P) 16–27) were
deeply anaesthetised with isoflurane by inhalation and
the brains were removed following decapitation. Using a
vibratome (HM650V, Carl Zeiss Ltd.), horizontal hippocampal slices (250–300 μm thick) were cut in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) of the following
composition: 125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 26 mM
NaHCO3, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4.H2O, 25 mM glucose, 1
mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2; bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2.
Slices were incubated at room temperature in aCSF for an
hour before experimentation and used for up to 8 hours
after preparation.
Intracellular myo-inositol measurement (Table 1)
800,000 cortical neurones/well were plated in 6-well
plates. After 8–9 days in culture the neurones were stimulated with inositol, lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold acetonitrile
with 100 mM ammonium acetate (90:10, v/v), briefly
spun down and supernatant analysed. A standard curve
was generated using pure myo-inositol (10–0.1 μM). A
Jasco binary gradient HPLC system was used. Eluates were
detected using an Applied Biosystems Sciex API-4000 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a Tur-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/10/54

boIonSpray ion-source. The operating parameters of the
ion-source, including analyte-dependent and sourcedependent were optimised to obtain the optimum performance from the mass spectrometer for the analysis of
myo-inositol. The sensitivity of detection for myo-inositol
in the negative ion mode was found to be higher than in
positive mode. The collision associated dissociation of
myo-inositol precursor at m/z (mass/charge) 179 produced
abundant ions at m/z 161, 117, 99 and 87. Of these product ions m/z 179→87 transition was selected as it provided the greatest selectivity. For [2H6]-myo-inositol (CDN
isotopes) the best signal for precursor-to-product transition was m/z 185→167. The optimum values for declustering potential, collision energy, entrance potential and
collision exit potential for the precursor-to-product ion
transitions selected are listed below. The source dependent parameters for myo-inositol consisted of collision gas,
curtain gas, ion spray gas 1 and 2, ionspray voltage and the
temperature of the heater gas, with optimum values of 6,
10, 20, 30, -4.5 kV and 600°C, respectively. An aliquot (5
μl) of myo-inositol was loaded onto a 150 × 2.1 mm i.d.
Luna HILIC column (Phenomenex). The column temperature was maintained at 35°C. A linear gradient elution
profile was used for the separation of myo-inositol. The
mobile-phase consisted of eluent 'A', composed of a mixture of acetonitrile and 100 mM ammonium acetate
buffer (90:10%, (v/v)), and eluent 'B', composed of acetonitrile, water and 100 mM ammonium acetate buffer
(50:40:10%, (v/v)). A flow rate of 0.43 ml/min was used.
The following elution profile was used: 0.0 min – 100%
A; 2.5 min – 100% A; 12.0 min – 50% A and 50% B (linear gradient from 2.5 to 12.0 min); 12.9 min – 50% A and
50% B; 13.0 min – return to 100% A; hold for 7 min
before proceeding to the next injection.
Immunocytochemistry – primary neurones and cell lines
Cells were seeded at 30,000–50,000 cells per well in 24well plate format on glass coverslips coated with poly-Dlysine. Following transfection, cells were fixed with 4%
(w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min at room temperature (RT). Cells were washed three times with PBS and
permeabilised with 0.3% (v/v) Triton X100 for 5 min. 5%
(v/v) normal goat serum (Chemicon) in PBS was used as
blocking agent for 1 h. Primary antibodies were diluted in
blocking solution and cells incubated overnight at 4°C
with gentle shaking, followed by three washes with PBS.
The secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor conjugated antibodies (Molecular Probes; 1:400), applied for 1
h at RT (in darkness). The coverslips were mounted onto
glass slides with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with or
without DAPI (Molecular Probes) to detect the cell nuclei.
Cells were visualised using an Olympus BX51 microscope
equipped with epifluorescent optics using Image-Pro Plus
(Media Cybernetics) or Special Cell F (Olympus) software
to analyse the images. For confocal imaging a Leica TLS SP

ethanol concentrations and xylene).

Immunohistochemistry – rat and human brain
The analysis of the HMIT protein distribution in rat brain
was performed on adult animals anaesthetised with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with
saline for 5 min, followed by 15 min of fixation with 4%
(w/v) PFA in PBS. Thirty μm-thick coronal brain sections
were cut using a vibratome (Leica) and left free-floating in
PBS. The slices were firstly exposed to antigen-retrieval,
consisting of 30 min incubation at 80°C in 0.1 M TrisHCl added with 1 mM EDTA, pH 9 and then blocked for
1 h in PBS supplemented with 3% (v/v) goat serum (Vector Laboratories), 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma) and
0.02% (v/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) at RT. The slices
were incubated overnight at 4°C in the same buffer with
anti-HMIT:21 at a dilution of 1:200 and then incubated in
PBS with the fluorescent secondary antibody 488 goat
anti-rabbit (Alexa-Fluor; Molecular Probes). Finally, slices
were mounted on slides with Vectashield-mounting
medium for fluorescence (Vector Laboratories), covered
with a coverslip and visualised by fluorescent microscopy.

[3H]-myo-inositol uptake in HEK293T cells
The method utilised was based on Uldry et al. [7].
HEK293T cells were seeded at 40,000 cells per well in 24well poly-D-lysine-coated plate format. 24 h after seeding,
cells were transiently transfected with HMIT triple mutant
DNA using Fugene 6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h after transfection, [3H]-myoinositol uptake was measured at pH 6.0 in a total assay
volume of 500 μl. Cells were washed twice with K5 buffer
(5 mM KCl, 127 mM NMDG, 10 mM D-glucose, 1 mM
MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, 2.7 mM CaCl2; pH 7.4). Cells were
pre-incubated for 10 min at 37°C with 0, 1 or 3 mM phloridzin, a non-selective HMIT inhibitor, in 450 μl of K5
buffer (5 mM KCl, 127 mM NMDG, 10 mM D-glucose, 1
mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, 2.7 mM CaCl2; pH 6.0). Phloridzin was prepared as a 100× stock in neat ethanol, subsequently diluted in the assay buffer to give a final
concentration of 1% ethanol. The reaction was started by
the addition of 50 μl (5 μCi) of [3H]-myo-inositol (GE
Healthcare)/2 mM cold myo-inositol mix, prepared in pH
6.0 K5 buffer. After 2 min the reaction was stopped by
aspiration of the [3H]-myo-inositol and washing five times
with 0.75 ml of ice-cold PBS. Cells were solubilised in 0.5
ml of 5% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at 37°C for
30 min. Lysates were mixed with 4.5 ml of Ultima Gold
XR (Perkin Elmer) scintillation liquid and radioactivity
counted by scintillation spectroscopy (Tri-Carb 2800TR,
Perkin Elmer). All data are reported as mean ± S.D.

The distribution of the HMIT protein in the human brain
was investigated in formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded
(FFPE) tissues obtained from Zoion, Inc. as an anatomical
gift, following approved ethical guidelines. Five μm-thick
tissue slices were cut using a microtome (Micron) and collected on slides. The tissue sections were then processed
through a de-paraffination consisting of a series of washes
in xylene, mixtures of xylene and ethanol, and decreasing
ethanol concentrations (100%, 95%, 70%, 50%). The sections were then exposed to heat-induced antigen retrieval
in a microwave oven (2 cycles of 5 min with an output of
700 W with a 1 min interval between the two boiling
cycles) in 0.1 M Tris-HCl with 1 mM EDTA, pH 9. The
slices were then incubated for 10 min in 1% (v/v) H2O2 in
PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and then blocked
for 1 h at RT in the same blocking buffer used for rat tissues. In the same buffer, the slices were incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-HMIT:21 antibody at a dilution of
1:200. Subsequently, tissue sections were incubated with
biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) affinity purified made
in goat secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) in PBS
with 1% (v/v) goat serum and then exposed for 45 min to
avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex (ABC Standard,
Vector Laboratories), before incubation in 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Vector Laboratories) for 3 min fol-

[3H]-CDP-DAG accumulation in mouse HMIT null-mutant
cortical neurones
Mouse HMIT null-mutant and wild-type cortical neurones, prepared as described above, were seeded at
150,000 cells per well in 24-well poly-D-lysine-coated
plates. Seven or nine days after plating, [3H]-CDP-DAG
accumulation was measured using a method adapted
from Atack et al. [11]. Media was removed and neurones
pre-incubated with 300 μl/well of modified KrebsHensleit buffer (118 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 4.7 mM
KCl, 1.3 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 5
mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose; pH 7.4) containing 0.3 μCi
[3H]-5-cytidine (Sigma) for 1 h at 37°C. Endogenous
muscarinic G-protein coupled receptors were stimulated
with 1 mM CCh in the presence of the inositol monophosphatase and inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase
inhibitor LiCl (10 mM), to prevent formation of myoPage 10 of 12

inositol, thus, resulting in [3H]-CDP-DAG accumulation.
Experiments were performed over a time course in the
absence or presence of 3 mM extracellular myo-inositol.
Incubations were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of a
mixture of methanol and chloroform (2:1, (v/v)) containing 1 M HCl to each well, which was left to extract for 5
min at RT. Well contents were transferred to centrifuge
tubes; 310 μl of chloroform and 560 μl of 0.1 M HCl were
added to aid phase separation. Samples were centrifuged
at 0.1 rcf for 10 min at RT. An aliquot (400 μl) of the lower
organic phase was removed, without disturbing the aqueous upper layer, transferred to scintillation vials and solvent was evaporated overnight. Ultima Gold XR scintillant
liquid (4.5 ml) was then added and the samples counted
by scintillation spectroscopy. All data are reported as
mean ± S.D.

intracellular solution allowed to dialyse for at least 15 min
before recording); 25 mM K+ external solution for 2 min;
pre-incubation of slices at 30°C (for >2 h before recording); or depolarisation by current injection in currentclamp mode.

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings
HEK293 cells and cultured rat neurones, prepared as
above, were perfused with an external solution containing: 145 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM
glucose, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4 with NaOH.
In some experiments, NaCl was replaced with NMDG-Cl.
Patch pipettes (5–10 MΩ tip resistance) were filled with:
135 mM KMeSO4, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgATP, 0.2 mM Na2GTP, 0.5 mM EGTA; pH 7.3; 280–300
mOsmol/kg. Membrane currents were recorded by wholecell voltage-clamp using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and
pClamp9 software (Molecular Devices). The holding
membrane potential was set at -60 or -70 mV unless specified otherwise. Solutions containing test compounds
were applied via a dual-barrel fast perfusion system (RSC160; Biologic) and all experiments were conducted at RT.

HMIT null-mutant mouse generation
The technical strategy for the KO mouse generation is
described in Additional files 1 and 4.

Hippocampal slices were superfused (2–3 ml/min) at RT
with aCSF: 125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO3,
1.25 mM NaH2PO4.H2O, 25 mM glucose, 2 mM CaCl2, 1
mM MgCl2; pH 7.3 when bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2.
Interneurones in the CA3 stratum radiatum and CA3 and
CA1 stratum lacunosum-moleculare were visualised under
IR-DIC optics (Nikon). Membrane currents were recorded
by whole-cell voltage-clamp using a Multipatch 700B
amplifier and pClamp9 software (Molecular Devices).
Patch pipettes had tip resistances of 5–10 MΩ when filled
with internal solution: 130 mM KMeSO4 or CsMeSO4, 4
mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM EGTA, 4 mM Mg-ATP,
0.2 mM Na2GTP; pH 7.3, 300 mOsmol/kg. Pressure
micro-application of myo-inositol (5–15 p.s.i.; Picospritzer, Warner Instruments) was achieved using a glass
pipette of tip diameter 50–150 μm positioned adjacent to
the target cell body. All test compounds were bath perfused via gravity feed. In some experiments, brain slices
were stimulated by: perfusion of glutamate (10 or 100
μM) for 5–30 min; phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(PMA) (0.5 or 5 μM) for 30–60 min; D-myo-phosphati-

Data analysis of agonist-evoked currents was performed
using pClamp9 (Molecular Devices) and Origin7.5 (Original Lab Corp.) software. Concentration-response curves
were fitted with the Hill equation: y = 1+ (EC50/x)nH,
where y is the membrane current, EC50 is the concentration of half-maximal efficacy, x is the agonist concentration, and nH is the Hill coefficient. All data are reported as
mean ± S.E.M.
