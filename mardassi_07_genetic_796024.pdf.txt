Abstract
Background: Among the surface antigens of Mycoplasma hominis, the P120' protein was previously
shown to elicit a subtle antibody response and appears to be relatively conserved. To get better
insight into the evolution of this protein, we analysed the genetic variability of its surface exposed
region in 27 M. hominis isolates recovered from the genital tract of Tunisian patients with infertility
disorders.
Methods: All specimens were processed for culture and PCR amplification of the N-terminal
surface exposed region of p120' gene. PCR products were sequenced to evaluate the genetic
variability, to test for adaptive selection, and to infer the phylogenetic relationship of the M. hominis
isolates.
Results: Sequence analysis showed a total of 25 single nucleotide polymorphisms distributed
through 23 polymorphic sites, yielding 13 haplotypes. All but one mutation were confined within
three distinct regions. Analysis of the amino acid-based phylogenetic tree showed a predominant
group of 17 closely related isolates while the remaining appear to have significantly diverged.
Conclusion: By analysing a larger sample of M. hominis recovered from patients with urogenital
infections, we show here that the P120' protein undergoes substantial level of genetic variability at
its surface exposed region.

Background
Mycoplasma hominis belongs to the class Mollicutes, the
smallest cell-wall free prokaryotic organisms. Mycoplasmas are considered to be a clostridial branch of Gram positive eubacteria and were supposed to have lost a large part
of genomic material and metabolic pathways during their

evolution [1,2]. Recently, the M. hominis genome size was
reported and shown to be composed of 665,445 kpb with
27 mol% of G+C [3]. M. hominis is an opportunistic pathogen causing gynaecological infections [4]. It has been
associated with pyelonephritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and postpartum septicaemia [5]. M. hominis is

increasingly detected in extragenital infections [6], infants
born to infected mothers became infected with these bacteria [7] and colonization of the respiratory tract of infants
has been associated with pneumonia and meningitis
[8,9].
Like the majority of mycoplasma species, M. hominis
appears to be equipped with a genetic system that allows
it in vivo to alter its surface exposed, membrane-associated, antigenic repertoire. Three surface membrane proteins, P120, Lmp, and Vaa, whose products undergo
genetic variability could account for the ability of this
microorganism to circumvent the host immune system
[10-13]. The highly antigenic P120 gene displays a hypervariable region due to accumulation of mutations, while
Lmp1 and Lmp2 genes show size variations and could be
expressed as a chimearic protein. The Vaa gene product,
which is involved in cell adherence, displays both size variation and frameshift mutation to create variant products.
However, an additional surface protein, related to the variable P120 was identified and named P120' [10]. In contrast to the former, P120' appears to be particularly
conserved and weakly recognised by sera from patients
with M. hominis confirmed infection. It has been speculated that P120 and P120' could have evolved by gene
duplication followed by sequence divergence, whose
extreme counterpart example is represented by the pMGA
gene family of the avian Mycoplasma gallisepticum [14,15].
In the present study, we show that the N-terminal surface
exposed region of the P120' protein undergoes substantial
genetic variability within strains isolated from patients
displaying urogenital and infertility disorders.

Methods
Mycoplasma strains and growth media
Five reference strains of human mycoplasmas, three ureaplasma isolates, and 27 mycoplasma clinical isolates were
used: Reference strains were purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC): M. hominis PG21 (ATCC
23114), M. fermentans (ATCC 19989), M. genitalium
(ATCC 33530), M. pneumoniae (ATCC 15531), and Ureaplasma urealyticum, isolate UuipT3, recovered in our laboratory. Reference and isolated mycoplasma strains were
cultivated in SP-4 medium [16] supplemented with 5% of
CMRL 1066 (Sigma), 2000 units/ml of penicillin G, 500
units/ml of polymyxin B, 2.5 µg/ml amphotericin B, 10%
of fresh yeast extract (Amersham Biosciences), 15% of
horse serum (Gibco BRL), and 0.5% phenol red. The
medium was further supplemented with 0.5% of glucose,
0.5% of arginine, or 0.5% of urea depending on the nutritional needs of the species being cultivated. Broth culture
was done at 37°C and mycoplasma growth confirmation
was performed onto SP-4 agar plates maintained at 37°C

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/7/142

with 5% CO2 and regularly observed microscopically for
the appearance of mycoplasma colonies.
Clinical specimens
Cervical swabs from 34 female patients suffering from sexually transmissible disease, 23 vaginal specimens from
women presenting a number of complications associated
to pregnancy, including chorioamnionitis and preterm
birth, 29 urethral specimens obtained from men with urethritis, and 6 semen samples from clinical cases associated
with infertility. All these specimens were tested for the
presence of genital mycoplasmas (M. hominis, M. genitalium, M. fermentans, and Ureaplasma urealyticum) by broth
and solid culture, then by PCR. The collected specimens
were inoculated onto 1.8 ml SP-4 broth medium and then
transferred to the laboratory at 4°C within 24 h. Semen
samples were also placed in a tube with 1.8 ml SP-4
medium for cultivation attempts. The specimens were
processed on arrival or after storage at -80°C. After filtration through 0.45 µm single use syringe filter, 200 µl of
the specimen was inoculated into each of SP-4 broth with
0.5% of glucose and 0.5% of arginine for the isolation and
identification of mycoplasmas and SP-4U broth with
0.5% of urea for Ureaplasma urealyticum isolation and
identification. In parallel, 100 µl of the filtrated specimen
was inoculated onto each of SP-4 and SP-4U agar plate for
the monitoring of mycoplasma or ureaplasma colonies
appearance. All broth cultures were incubated at 37°C
and examined daily for turbidity and pH change. The
broth cultures were subcultured onto agar plates once
their pH changes. The plates were incubated at 37°C in a
5% carbon dioxide environment and examined every two
days for the appearance of mycoplasmas or ureaplasma
colonies. To confirm the identification of Mycoplasma
spp or ureaplasma, PCR assays have been used on positive
broth cultures. For mycoplasma titration, dilution culture
and subculture were achieved as described elsewhere [17].

This study has been conducted in close conformity with
ethical aspects, which were established by the ethical committee of the Tunisian Ministry of Health. The samples
were collected in the context of the routine diagnostic
activity of the laboratory of Mycoplasma and with the
consent of the patients. All the patient files are confidential and none could be identified.
DNA extraction and sample preparation for PCR
amplification
Culture (8 ml) of the cloned mycoplasma strains and clinical samples was centrifuged at 17 000 rpm for 30 min,
washed in PBS (0.1 M-NaCl, 2.5 mM-KCl, 10 mMNa2HPO4, 1.5 mM-KH2PO4, pH 7.4), and then suspended in 200 µl of PBS. This concentrated culture was
processed for PCR as described elsewhere [18]. Briefly,
SDS to a final concentration of 1% was added to the DNA

and incubated at 37°C for half an hour in the presence of
RNase A (5 µg/ml). A volume of 25 µl was then used for
PCR amplification.
Primers and PCR amplification
Two pairs of primers were used in this study. The pair
Mhp120'F (5'-GAGGAATTTCAACTGGTGTCC-3') and
Mhp120'R (5'-CTGTTGTAATAGCATTTAAG-3') was specific to the M. hominis p120' gene. PCR was performed on
25 µl of treated sample in a total volume of 50 µl containing, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM
MgCl2, 250 µM of each dNTP (Amersham Biosciences),
50 pmol of each primers, and 1.25 U of Taq DNA
polymerase (Amersham Biosciences). The PCR mixtures
were subjected to 30 cycles consisting of 1 min at 95°C, 2
min at 50°C, and 1 min at 72°C in a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp PCR System 9700 thermocycler. After the last cycle,
a final extension temperature of 72°C was maintained for
10 min. To determine the specificity of M. hominis primers, the PCR reaction was performed with DNAs from
other mycoplasma species, M. fermentans, M. genitalium,
M. pneumoniae, which occasionally has been isolated from
urogenital tract, and Ureaplasma urealyticum, strain
UuipT3. The PCR products were analysed on 2% agarose
gels. The PCR experiments were repeated at least twice for
results confirmation.
Sequence analysis
The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in a
1.5% low-melting-point agarose gel, excised from the gel,
and then purified using the GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band
Purification system (Amersham Biosciences). Determination of the nucleotide sequence was performed with the
Prism Ready Reaction Dye Deoxy Terminator Cycle
sequencing Kit on an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer
(Applied Biosystems). Each sample was sequenced from
two independent PCR amplification reactions.

The sequence data (GenBank accession numbers; pending) were aligned using ClustalW [19] and edited with the
software programs BioEdit [20]. DNASP [21] was used to
calculate haplotypes and to test for adaptive selection, by
determining the nucleotide substitution changes and the
ratio of synonymous (Ks) and nonsynonymous (Ka) substitutions per site. For this purpose, we used the analysis
developed by Nei-Gojobori [22] as implemented in the
DNASP package. A dendrogram illustrating the genetic
relatedness of the recovered M. hominis isolates was constructed using MEGA version 3.0. [23]. The dendrogram
was obtained using the neighbor-joining method with
1000 bootstrapping replicates.

Results
Isolation, titration and cloning of M. hominis strains
To determine the initial count of the mycoplasma species
contained within the clinical samples, ten-fold dilutions
of the original sample were performed and inoculated to
SP-4 agar plates. Among the clinical specimens, 27 yielded
a high number of viable mycoplasma varying from 105 to
106 C.F.U. (colony forming unit)/ml for M. hominis and
only 5 M. genitalium and 12 U. urealyticum isolates were
detected by culture with low number (≤ 104 C.F.U/ml)
(Tab. 1). As mycoplasma cultures obtained from clinical
specimens often represent a mixture of several species,
especially with M. hominis and U. urealyticum, cloning was
undertaken so that PCR amplification would involve a
DNA template prepared from a single clone. Cloning is
also crucial to obtain a real picture of the genetic heterogeneity within a single specie. For this purpose, single colonies from the highest (often the fifth or the sixth
dilution) ten-fold dilutions of each specimen culture were
picked, cultured into SP-4 broth medium, then diluted
through 10 serial dilutions, and finally, 100 µl of each
dilution was subcultured onto a SP-4 agar plate. This process was repeated thrice and allowed the appearance of typical Mycoplasma hominis colonies in these 27 high tittering
clinical specimens. The colonies are clearly distinguishable from those of U. urealyticum which are characterized
by their tiny size and dark colour.
PCR amplification and genetic diversity of the P120'
surface exposed N-terminal coding sequence
All the 27 M. hominis cloned isolates yielded a PCR product of the expected molecular size (510 bp), suggesting
that this gene sequence is highly conserved (Fig. 1). No
amplification was observed using DNAs from other mycoplasma species namely, M. genitalium, M. fermentans, M.
pneumoniae and U. urealyticum (Fig. 1, lanes 3–6), thus
confirming the specificity of the PCR reaction. The nucleotide sequence encompassing the positions 145 to 565
(421 nucleotides) of the P120' gene sequence (amino
acids 49 to 188) was obtained for each sample, by
sequencing in both directions, two PCR products from
independent amplifications. A total of 25 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed through 23 polymorphic sites were observed (A162G, T177A, T192G,
A212T, A212G, A215G, C234T, T297C, A300G, A300C,
A379C, G394A, C396T, A399T, C405T, A409T, A417T,
T441A, A482T, C483T, G500T, C509T, A552G, A563G,
and T564A), yielding 13 haplotypes. Mutations at positions 234 (C to T) and 394 (G to T) were shared by the 27
isolates, whereas the SNPs at positions 297, 300, 379,
396, 405, 500, and 552 were found in more than 20 isolates.

Among the 23 polymorphic sites, thirteen (56.5%) are
non synonymous as they cause an amino acid change

I137F, E139D, D161V, R167I, A170V, and N188R) (Fig.
2). Of these, mutations K127Q, V132I, A170V, and
N188K were shared by most of the isolates. Overall, the
mutations were mainly confined within three regions,
59–72, 127–139, and 161–188, each containing four
amino acid changes. We could distinguish 10 haplotypes
among the deduced amino acid sequences.
Genetic relatedness of M. hominis isolates and evolution
of the N-terminal region of P120'
The unrooted neighbour-joining-based phylogenetic
derived tree (Fig. 3), using the deduced amino acid
sequences of the 27 M. hominis isolates, showed a major
branch containing a group of 17 closely-related isolates
and 6 variant emerging strains. This major branch, which
is supported by bootstrap, is clearly distinct from that of
the reference M. hominis strain PG21. The remaining isolates are less phylogentically close to the majority of the
pool; Mh13 and Mh8 belonging to a distinct evolutionary
tract.

The acquisition rates for sSNP (Ks) and nsSNP (Ka) were
calculated in order to evaluate the evolutionary trend of
this surface exposed part of the P120' protein. We found
that the overall mean value of 0.046 for Ks (0.011–0.47)
is significantly different (P < 0.0001) from the 0.012
mean value of Ka (0.003–0.18). The ratio Ka/Ks (0.26) is
thus <1, indicative of a negative selection. This finding is
in accordance with a previous study involving housekeeping genes [24].

Discussion
M. hominis is commonly associated with the normal flora
of the female genital tract, in many instances, it was also

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/7/142

isolated at high titers from patients with clinical manifestations [7]. Factors relating to host (impairment of local
immunity) and to M. hominis (essentially selection of
immune escape mutants and perturbation of the host cell)
have been suggested as a basis for the disruption of the
host-pathogen equilibrium and the appearance of clinical
disorders [25].
Because M. hominis in the processed samples was at significant high titers, we reasoned that sufficient replication
would have occurred in the face of the immune system of
the host and, thus, it could be an opportunity to evaluate
the genetic variability of surface exposed proteins. We
focused our analysis on P120' protein, a homolog of
P120, which unlike the latter, seems to be less subjected
to genetic variability [10,26], and whose function remains
to be determined. We targeted the N-terminal region of
the P120' protein as it has been previously shown to be
surface exposed [10]. Our results show that significant
variability among the different isolates has accumulated,
although the time frame in which the isolates were
obtained is relatively short. This finding is in fair agreement with a previous study that showed that M. hominis
isolates from different individuals always differed, a finding explained by the occurrence of intergenic recombination [24]. One can argue that higher variability would
have been observed if samples collected over extended
time periods were analysed. However, one cannot also
dismiss the possibility that increased genetic variability
could have been observed among isolates belonging to
different geographical origins. This might be reflected, in
our study, by the fact that the English M. hominis reference
strain, PG21, differed from most of the Tunisian isolates
in 4 of the varying sites. In fact, the latter strain also differed from all the isolates included in Sogaard's study. As
far as could ascertained, as a reference strain, PG21 could
have been subjected to several passages and transferred to
many laboratories, thus contributing to its apparent divergence.
All but one mutation was confined within three distinct
regions, suggesting that they might be under selective
pressure. Hence, although the surface exposed region,
analysed as a whole, appears to be naturally under negative selection (Ka/Ks < 1), the three main variable regions
might evolve towards the accumulation of higher non
synonymous changes, and may thus represent variable
evolving domains. Within the pool of recovered isolates,
a predominant group of closely-related strains was identified. Phylogenetic analysis showed that variants from this
group tend to emerge. It remains to be seen, through analysis of larger samples over extended periods of time,
whether emergence of these variants is a result of the host
immune pressure. It is worthy of mentioning that P120' is
weakly recognised by patient sera, thus immune selection

Conclusion
Overall, this study showed that the homolog of the variable surface exposed P120 protein, P120', was subjected to
genetic variability in its surface exposed domain despite
its low reactivity with patient sera. Since both genes seem
to have evolved through gene duplication and genetic
divergence, they would certainly assume distinct essential
functions as they are both conserved and expressed within
a single strain. This situation contrasts with other mycoplasmas, such as the avian M. gallisepticum [15] and M.
synoviae [27], whereby only one member of the family of
the variable antigens is expressed. M. homonis does not
seem to follow this restrictive strategy as, apart from P120
and P120', at least two other variable proteins, Lmp and
Vaa, contribute to its variability.
