Abstract
Background: Combination anti-viral therapies have reduced treatment failure rates by requiring
multiple specific mutations to be selected on the same viral genome to impart high-level drug
resistance. To determine if the common protease inhibitor resistance mutation L90M is only
selected once or repeatedly on different HIV genetic backbones during the course of failed antiviral therapies we analyzed a linked region of the viral genome during the evolution of multi-drug
resistance.
Results: Using L90M allele specific PCR we amplified and sequenced gag-pro regions linked to very
early L90M containing HIV variants prior to their emergence and detection as dominant viruses in
15 failed salvage therapy patients. The early minority L90M linked sequences were then compared
to those of the later L90M viruses that came to dominate the plasma quasispecies. Using Bayesian
evolutionary analysis sampling trees the emergence of L90M containing viruses was seen to take
place on multiple occasion in 5 patients, only once for 2 patients and an undetermined number of
time for the remaining 8 patients.
Conclusion: These results indicate that early L90M mutants can frequently be displaced by viruses
carrying independently selected L90M mutations rather than by descendents of the earlier mutants.

Introduction
High rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication and mutation in vivo results in the continuous
generation of genetic variation [1]. HIV within a patient is
therefore present as a mixture of related but distinct
genetic variants collectively referred to as a quasispecies.
HIV variants in different anatomical locations of the same
individual also frequently differ possibly reflecting adaptation to local cellular environments, difference in immu-

nological pressures and/or founder effects of tissue
colonization [2,3]. Differences in the strength of anti-retroviral therapy selective pressure in different tissues and
cell types may also contribute to the uneven distribution
of drug resistance variation in vivo [4].
HIV protease inhibitors impair the maturation and resulting infectivity of viral particles leading to a rapid decline
in plasma viremia as the major virus producing cells are

depleted by viral cytopathic effects and/or immune
responses. Different amino acid substitutions in the viral
protease region are tightly associated with reduced sensitivity to protease inhibitors and rebounding viral loads.
These mutations may also emerge in a sequential order [58]. Primary drug resistance mutations that alone confers
moderate resistance such as V82A and L90M are initially
selected followed by the addition of secondary mutations
often located outside of the active site of the PR, such as
L10I, M36I, M46I, L63P, or A71V leading to higher levels
of resistance [9,10].
In addition to protease inhibitor resistance mutations in
the protease gene, HIV protease cleavage site mutations
can also be selected to compensate for reduced enzymatic
activity against the wild-type cleavage sites [11-13].
Evolution of protease inhibitors resistance has been studied using mathematical models as well as longitudinal
sequence analysis of HIV in vivo [9,14]. Such studies confirmed the expected presence, prior to therapy, of very low
level of drug resistant mutants [15]. Both secondary protease resistance mutations and protease cleavage site
mutations have been detected prior to protease inhibitor
selection treatment [16]. The usually negative consequence of such drug resistance mutations on viral replicative fitness (in the absence of anti-retroviral therapy) is
likely to keep the pre-treatment frequency of drug resistant mutants low [17]. Early during sub-optimal anti-retroviral therapy, weakly drug resistant viruses are therefore
selected followed by the accumulation of further drug
resistance mutations resulting in high-level drug resistance. The genetic characteristics of selected drug resistant
variants in vivo has been longitudinally analyzed after
these variants have reached a significant proportion of the
plasma population using direct PCR sequencing methods
[18-23]. Technically more demanding has been the analysis of the early stage of drug resistant mutant selection
when selected mutants are still present at a very low frequency within the dominant drug sensitive viral quasispecies. Several studies have reported the emergence of
previously minority variants carrying drug resistance
mutations to dominate the later quasispecies and the frequent occurrence of viral recombination [24-26]. In this
study we genetically characterized protease inhibitor
resistant variants carrying the protease L90M mutation
before they reached readily detectable frequencies (i.e.
using direct PCR population sequencing) in patients failing salvage antiretroviral therapies. L90M is one of the
most common protease-inhibitor resistance mutations
and is selected primarily by the protease-inhibitors
saquinavir, nelfinavir, and indinavir, at least one of which
was received by each of the patients in this study. The
L90M mutation, which is not located near the enzyme' s
active site, is thought to displaces L24, which is adjacent

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/7

to the catalytic residue D25, reducing the volume of the
substrate cleft or protease dimer stability decreasing susceptibility to most protease inhibitors [27-29]. L90M
allele specific amplification and sequencing of the resulting PCR product allowed us to compare an upstream
linked region of early minority L90M variants with those
of co-replicating dominant L90 viruses and to the L90M
viruses which later came to dominate the plasma quasispecies [9,13,30]. Using Bayesian evolutionary analysis to
sample alternative phylogenetic trees we determined that
in a significant fraction of patients the early and later
L90M carrying variants appear to have distinct origins,
and therefore to have been originally selected on different
genetic backbones.

Results
Selective amplification of variant carrying L90M mutation
PCR primers were designed and tested to specifically
amplify variants carrying the protease drug resistance
mutation L90M present at low frequencies within quasispecies dominated by wild type viruses. We targeted the
protease L90M mutation as a frequently selected primary
drug resistant mutation providing measurable levels of
resistance to all currently approved protease inhibitors.
The L90M mutation being located near the extremity of
the protease gene also allowed linkage of early L90M
mutations with other upstream protease polymorphisms.
PCR primers located upstream of protease were also used
to amplify a region of gag including multiple protease
cleavage sites [13]. A protocol was first designed and
tested for the specific amplification of minority L90M
mutants starting from PCR products generated using
generic gag-pro nested PCR (see material and methods).

In order to measure the specificity of our L90M targeting
PCR primer we first tested two plasmids (pAKL90 and
pAK90M) encoding the w.t. L90 and mutant L90M
codons respectively. The L90M specific primer AK90m
was designed with its three 3' end nucleotides complementary to the L90M methionine codon (ATG). The 4th
complementary base of that primer (relative to HIV) was
deleted and a 5th base resulting in a mismatch was used
(Fig. 1A). The next AK90m nucleotides were complementary to the HIV subtype B consensus sequence. Relative to
other L90M targeting primers tested the deletion of the 4th
base and mismatching of the 5th base significantly reduced
background annealing to the w.t. L90 codon (TTG)(data
not shown).
Ten-fold dilutions of generic gag-pro PCR products
derived from plasmids pAKL90 and pAK90M were made
using generic gag-pro 2nd PCR round primers (AKG2 and
EDPR4)(see materials and methods). These PCR product
log dilutions were then tested using the L90M specific
primer pair (AKG3 and AK90m). Up to 104 fold dilutions

of the L90M generic gag-pro PCR products could be
amplified while none of the L90 generic gag-pro PCR
products was amplified (Fig 1B). To further evaluate the
discriminatory capability of the L90M specific primer
AK90m and more closely mimic conditions using clinical
samples serial dilutions of the L90M PCR products were
mixed with a constant amount of L90 PCR products. The
presence of L90M DNA could still be detected after a 1000
fold dilution while the L90 DNA target generated only a
shorter non-specific fragment at the highest L90M dilutions (Fig. 1C). To confirm that the amplicons generated
from the highest pAK90M PCR DNA dilutions (1:200 and
1:1000) were indeed derived from the minority L90M variant they were purified and directly sequenced. Sequencing confirmed, through the detection of all 15 internal
mutations distinguishing pAK90M from pAKL90, that the
L90M specific primers had specifically amplified the
L90M variant at the highest dilutions.
Sequence analysis of clones for confirmation of minority
population genotype
To further substantiate the specificity of our L90M specific
amplifications we analyzed the second PCR round generic
gag-pro PCR products from two plasma samples in which
the L90M variants were detected only using L90M specific
primers (i.e. not by direct sequencing of the generic PCR
products). Generic gag-pro amplicons from patient samples 608 (03/98) and 1391 (05/99) were subcloned into
E. coli plasmids and the presence of the L90M mutation
determined using the L90M specific primers. 150 insert
containing E. coli colonies (i.e. white) from each subcloning were replica plated and the presence of L90M in their
inserts tested by colony PCR (see materials and methods).
Two colony PCRs from 608 and one from 1391 were
L90M positive. These plasmids were purified and the presence of the L90M mutations confirmed by plasmid insert
sequencing. The sequence of the L90M plasmid subclones
were also compared to those derived by sequencing the
L90M specific amplicons derived from the generic gag-pol
PCR. The sequence polymorphisms distinguishing the
L90M specific amplicons from their respective majority
population sequences were similar to those detected in
the L90M positive plasmid subclones (data not shown).
These results further support the specificity of detection of
minority L90M variants using our allele specific PCR protocol.
Protease gene evolution
To analyze the early evolution of L90M longitudinally collected plasma samples from 45 patients who developed
L90M (as detected by direct PCR population sequencing)
were obtained. Generic gag-pol amplification products
from plasma samples available from earlier time points
(negative for L90M by direct PCR population sequencing)
were then tested using the L90M specific primers. The

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/7

early presence of low frequency L90M variants was
detected in fifteen of the forty-five patients. For nine
patients only a single time point showed the presence of
low-frequency L90M mutants. From these nine patients
three sequences were derived. Direct PCR population
sequencing of the generic gag-pol amplicons was used to
determine the consensus sequences of both the early
dominant w.t. and the later dominant L90M populations.
The later time point generic gag-pro sequences invariably
confirmed the dominance of the L90M mutation which
was detectable by direct population sequencing while the
earlier time point only showed w.t. codon 90 by direct
population sequencing as expected from the patient selection criteria (see materials and methods). The early time
point amplicons generated using the L90M specific primer
were also directly sequenced to determine the consensus
sequence of these minority L90M populations. Intermediate time points were available for another 6 patients and
the generic gag-pro and L90M specific PCR products,
when generated from these samples, were also directly
sequenced.
Bayesian analysis for monophyletic origin of L90M
carrying variants
To determine whether it was appropriate to include all
sequences in a single analysis and to test for recombination in the data set, we conducted a Phi test [31], as implemented in SplitsTree4 [32]. The Phi statistic tests for
genealogical correlation between neighboring sites
(which is negatively correlated with rate of recombination) using a modified pair-wise compatibility approach
[31]. Use of SplitsTree v 4 found no evidence for recombination in the data set (p = 0.17).

Fig 2 shows a summary of the phylogenetic relationships
between the sequences derived in this study, in which
each patient forms a well-supported monophyletic clade
thereby excluding the possibility of contamination or
sample mix-up. In order to investigate whether the two or
more sequences carrying the L90M mutation (the early
minority and the later dominant variants) were originally
derived from a single virus within each patient, we investigated the probability that the L90M associated
sequences formed a monophyletic clade with respect to
sequences lacking the L90M mutation within each patient
cluster. The probability of monophyly was calculated over
9000 trees drawn from the posterior distribution of the
MCMC analysis, and is listed for each patient in Table 1.
Our analysis indicated that the L90M mutations evolved
on more than one occasion in at least 5 patients (p â¤ 0.05;
patients 1174, 1317, 1125, 6501, 608). Alternatively, evidence for a single mutation event leading to both the early
and the late L90M mutation was seen for two patients (p
â¥ 0.95; patients 4334, 1124) while the phylogenetic evidence was inconclusive for the remaining eight patients

Discussion
The high level of genetic diversity of HIV in vivo provides
it with multiple strategies for evolving high levels of antiviral drug resistance. The originally selected drug resistant
mutants may accumulate further drug resistance protease
and RT mutations in a step-wise fashion to increase their
level of drug resistance, develop resistance to new antiviral drugs and attenuate fitness costs imposed by these
mutations. Longitudinally observed drug resistant populations may also have independent origins, having been
initially selected on different genetic backbones. In order
to further investigate this phenomenon we selectively
amplified and then sequenced HIV variants carrying the
frequently detected protease inhibitor resistance mutations L90M when these viruses were still only present as
minority variants. We then compared these viruses with
the L90M viruses from the same patients that later came
to dominate their plasma quasispecies. Evidence was
obtained that in a substantial subset of patients (5/15) the
L90M mutations were selected on multiple occasions. The
L90M variant that eventually emerged to readily detectable levels (i.e. using direct PCR population sequencing)

could therefore be of different origin than the earlier replicating minority L90M viruses. In another subset of
patients our analysis indicated that the later dominant
L90M variants descended from the earlier minority L90M
variant in a manner consistent with step-wise drug resistance mutations gradually accumulating on descendents of
the original L90M virus. The remaining patients could not
be confidently categorized into either group.
In vivo and in vitro studies have suggested an important
role for protease cleavage site mutations in restoring replicative fitness of drug resistant HIV variants [33,34]. We
found no significant evolution of these cleavage sites
among the 15 patients analyzed here.
While the phylogenetic analysis was able to differentiate
between monophyletic or multiple origins of the L90M
variants in many of the patients, it appeared most powerful when multiple sequences were available from several
time points. Four out of five of the subjects with multiple
L90M origins four were sampled at â¥4 time points (the
fifth patient 6501 was sampled twice). All patients with
apparently monophyletic L90M origins were sampled â¤3
times. Increasing the number of sampling over the course
of infection may therefore significantly improve the
capacity of such phylogenetic analyses to detect multiple
origins of a drug resistance mutation.
It is also noted that HIV recombination within a patient,
which is known to be commonplace in HIV-1 and is currently not possible to incorporate in a BEAST analysis,
may also affect the resulting reconstructions. Recombination may rapidly shuffle neighboring sequence fragments
obscuring the origin of different drug resistant variants.
Indeed such recombination has been recently demonstrated to occur in vivo [25,26] as anticipated from the
common detection of cell co-infected with multiple variants [35]. The Phi test used here works on the principle
that in the presence of recombination, sites that are nearer
to each other in sequence space should have greater compatibility with each other than will sites that are distant
from each other [31]. The statistical significance of genealogical correlations of adjacent sites is then evaluated
using a permutation test, in which the null hypothesis of
no recombination would result in no effect on correlation
of adjacent sites after permutation (as all sites share the
same history). The test is particularly appropriate for this
data set as it does not assume a single population, is powerful to detect recombination regardless of population
and demographic history, mutation rate and rate of
recombination, and has been shown to accurately distinguish between recent mutations and recombination even
with closely related sequences. While recombination was
not detected it remains possible that more frequent sampling or the analysis of clonal sequence data rather than

Summary tree showing the evolutionary relationships between all of the sequences used in this analysis, showing median node
heights derived from 9000 posterior trees. Labels on the tips first show the sampling date in month and year and whether the
generic (P for population) or L90M specific (M for mutant) PCR primers were used to generate the sequenced amplicons. The
following number (1 through 6) represents the order of the bleeds analyzed. Patient numbers are given in the margin.
Sequences that have the L90M mutation are indicated in darker bold fonts. Each patient forms a monophyletic cluster with
100% Bayesian posterior probability support (in 100% of posterior trees). Posterior support values for the monophyletic relationships of the sequences with the L90M mutation are given in Table 1. Patients with sequences showing evidence for multiple
origins of L90M are shown in red, those with a single L90M origin in blue and those with an inconclusive number of L90M origins in black.

population consensus sequences may have revealed a
greater level of recombination.
The detection of a polyclonal origin for the commonly
selected L90M protease mutation was anticipated given
the constant generation of HIV mutants. Selection of
some drug resistance mutation has been shown as early as
the initial phase of viremia control in patients undergoing
suppressive therapy [36]. This study shows that a common drug resistance mutation can frequently have multiple origins.

Methods
Patient Samples
The plasma samples of HIV infected persons undergoing
direct PCR sequencing for drug resistant genotyping at
Stanford University Hospital Diagnostic Virology Laboratory meeting the following criteria were selected for this
study: (i) Two drug resistance genotypes were performed
before or following virologic failure on a protease inhibitor containing regimen; and (ii) the first and second genotype performed showed complete absence followed by
the presence of the primary protease inhibitor resistance
mutationL90M using direct PCR population sequencing.
Available viral loads and antiretroviral drug regimen are
shown (see Additional file 1). The study was approved by
Stanford University Hospital and the University of California San Francisco committees on human research.
Viral RNA isolation and RT-nPCR
Viral RNA was extracted from 280 Î¼l of patient's plasma
using QIAGEN viral RNA extraction kit and eluted in 50 Î¼l
of RNase-free water. 15 Î¼l of extracted RNA was reverse
transcribed using 5 pmol of primer EDPR2 (TTGTTTAACTTTTGGGCCATCC [HXB2 positions 2597 to 2618])
in a solution containing 2 Î¼l of 10 mM dNTP at 95Â°C for
10 sec, followed by 65C for 5 min. 200 U of SuperScript II
RNase H- Reverse transcripatse, 5Ã first strand buffer, 30 U
of RNase Inhibitor in final volume of 25 Î¼l was kept on
42Â°C for 60 min, followed by 75Â°C for 15 min to inactivate the enzyme. Nested PCR using HIV-1 subtype B primers was then used to amplify a fragment encompassing
seven HIV protease cleavage sites (CA/p2, p2/NC, NC/p1,
NC/TFP, p1/p6, TFP/p6 and p6/protease) and all 99
amino acids of HIV protease gene (from HXB2 positions
1829 to 2577). First round of PCR was done using 10 Î¼l
of cDNA and primers AKG1 (GATGACAGAAACCTTGTTGGTCCA HXB2 positions 1736 to 2163]) and EDPR2
(TTGTTTAACTTTTGGGCCATCC HXB2 positions 2597â
2618) generating a 882 bp product. Second round PCR
used 1 Î¼l of first round PCR product and primers AKG2
(GACAGCATGTCAGGGAGTAGG HXB2 positions 1829â
1850)
and
EDPR4
(CTGGTACAGTTTCAATAGGACTAATGG HXB2 positions 2551 to 2577) generating a
748 bp product [22]. In text we refer to these primers as

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/7

the first and second PCR rounds generic gag-pro primers.
The final volume of each PCR reaction was 50 Î¼l containing 10 pmol of each primers, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.0, 50
mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% triton-X100, 2.5 mM of
each dNTP and 3.5 U Taq polymerase. PCR program consisted of 3 cycles at 94Â°C for 45 s, 57Â°C for 45 s, and 72Â°C
for 1 min, followed by 27 cycles at 94Â°C for 30 s, 57Â°C for
30 s, and 72Â°C for 1 min, and final extension at 72Â°C for
5 min. Using pNL4-3 plasmid dilutions the sensitivity of
this nested PCR was determined to be between 1 and 10
copies (data not shown). Second round PCR products
generated with AKG2 and EDPR4 were purified using
Quiagen PCR product purification kit and sequenced
using primer EDPR4. Sequencing of the entire PCR products was on occasion prevented by the presence of variants
of different length in the PCR product (due to the coamplification of indel variants). When sequencing such
PCRs the sequencing electrophoregram abruptly shows
the presence of mixed bases at every nucleotide position
following an insertion-deletion (indel) containing region.
To allow sequencing beyond the region of length polymorphism these PCR fragment were sequenced from the
other direction using primer AKG2 allowing us to generate the consensus sequence on both side of the indel. For
patients 608 and 1317 both consensus sequences (with
and without extra indel codon) are used in Figure 2 (taxa
labels ending in .1 and .2).
Selective amplification of minority variant carrying L90M
protease mutation
The pGEM-T vector backbone plasmids pAKL90 and
pAK90M each have a 748 bases long HIV fragment insert
of the second round PCR product generated by the second
PCR round generic gag-pro primers AKG2 and EDPR4.
pAK90M has the L90M mutation (methionine codon 90
= ATG) while pAKL90 is wild type L90 (leucine codon 90
= TTG). pAKL90 and pAK90M also differ at 15 nucleotides
positions within the fragment amplified by the L90M specific PCR.

Input DNA into the L90M specific PCR consisted of PCR
DNA generated from either plasmids or from cDNA from
clinical samples using the nested PCR generic gag-pro
primers. Second round PCR DNA was purified using Quiagen PCR product purification columns, diluted 1:100 in
water and 10 Î¼l of dilution was used as input for the L90M
selective PCR. The L90M specific primer was AK90m
(AAAGTGCAACCAATCTGACCAT HXB2 positions 2520â
2542) used together with AKG3 (ACCCGGCCATAAAGCAAG HXB2 positions 1853â1871) in a final PCR reaction volume of 50 Î¼l containing 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.0,
50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% triton-X100, 2.5 mM of
each dNTP, 15 pmol of each primer and 3.5 U Hot start
Taq polymerase. PCR cycling consisted of polymerase activation at 95Â°C for 15 min followed by 5 cycles at 95Â°C for

45 s, 50Â°C for 45 s, and 72Â°C for 1 min, and 10 cycles at
95Â°C for 30 s, 50Â°C for 30 s, and 72Â°C for 1 min, and
final extension at 72Â°C for 5 min. L90M specific amplification products generated with AK90m and AKG3 were
purified using Quiagen PCR product purification kit and
sequenced using primer AKG3. When indels variants of
different length were co-amplified, preventing complete
sequencing from AKG3, the primer AK90m was also used
to sequence from the other direction. Amplification of
L90M variants from E. coli colonies was performed by
touching a sterile toothpick to each colony and the toothpick then rubbed on the inside of a L90M specific PCR
reaction mixture followed by only eight cycle of L90M
specific PCR amplification (using AK90m and AKG3). The
PCR products were analyzed by PAGE.
Sequence analysis
PCR products of second round generic gag-pro amplicons
were 748 nucleotides. The L90M specific amplicons were
689 nucleotides. 611 nucleotides (HXB2 position 1903 to
2513) were included in the phylogenetic analysis to
accommodate nucleotide sequence unavailable from the
shorter L90M specific amplicons and low quality
sequence data immediately adjacent to the sequencing
primer. Mixed bases at nucleotide position were recorded
in direct sequencing when one minority electrophoregram peak was present at â¥40% of the total peak height.
Genbank accession numbers are: EU380596âEU380664

Sequence data was generated from 15 patients. The
number of sequences collected for each patient varied
from three to nine depending on the number of time
points available. Sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL
W with all settings set to the default values, and checked
by eye. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed
using the software BEAST v1.4 (Drummond AJ & Rambaut A (2006) BEAST v1.4, Available from [37]) that
allows the incorporation of sampling times into the evolutionary model to inform the molecular rate. A relaxed
molecular clock [38] was assumed, with a constant-size
coalescent prior on the tree. The HKY+G4 model of nucleotide evolution was used, which allows for different rates
of transitions and transversions and for rate heterogeneity
along the sequence (four categories). Posterior distributions of parameters and trees were investigated using
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, with samples from the posterior drawn every 2000 steps over a total
of 20,000,000 steps, and the first 10% discarded as burnin.
