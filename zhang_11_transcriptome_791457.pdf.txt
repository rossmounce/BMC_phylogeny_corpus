Abstract
Background: After several years in the juvenile phase, trees undergo flowering transition to become mature
(florally competent) trees. This transition depends on the balanced expression of a complex network of genes that
is regulated by both endogenous and environmental factors. However, relatively little is known about the
molecular processes regulating flowering transition in woody plants compared with herbaceous plants.
Results: Comparative transcript profiling of spring shoots after self-pruning was performed on a spontaneously
early flowering trifoliate orange mutant (precocious trifoliate orange, Poncirus trifoliata) with a short juvenile phase
and the wild-type (WT) tree by using massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS). A total of 16,564,500 and
16,235,952 high quality reads were obtained for the WT and the mutant (MT), respectively. Interpretation of the
MPSS signatures revealed that the total number of transcribed genes in the MT (31,468) was larger than in the WT
(29,864), suggesting that newly initiated transcription occurs in the MT. Further comparison of the transcripts
revealed that 2735 genes had more than twofold expression difference in the MT compared with the WT. In
addition, we identified 110 citrus flowering-time genes homologous with known elements of flowering-time
pathways through sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. These genes are highly conserved in citrus and other
species, suggesting that the functions of the related proteins in controlling reproductive development may be
conserved as well.
Conclusion: Our results provide a foundation for comparative gene expression studies between WT and
precocious trifoliate orange. Additionally, a number of candidate genes required for the early flowering process of
precocious trifoliate orange were identified. These results provide new insight into the molecular processes
regulating flowering time in citrus.

Background
Flowering is one of the most important aspects of development in plants to ensure successful reproduction and
eventual adaptation to surrounding environments. Plants
have evolved mechanisms to integrate various environmental signals, including photoperiod and vernalization,

to enable flowering under conditions that optimize seed
production [1,2]. In recent years, molecular and genetic
regulation of flower development has been extensively
investigated in herbaceous plants, particularly in Arabidopsis [3-5]. A number of different pathways have been
described in Arabidopsis that induce the floral transition, including vernalization, photoperiod, autonomous,
and gibberellin (GA) pathways that form a regulatory
network [6,7]. Genes involved in controlling the timing
of floral transition have been identified through mutagenesis and analysis of natural variation. These four

promotion pathways are integrated through the transcriptional regulation of two “flowering-time” genes,
FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) [8-10] and SUPPRESSOR
OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1), and
two floral meristem identity genes, LEAFY (LFY) and
APETALA1 (AP1) [10-13]. Among the integrators, FT
and SOC1 have a more direct function in determining
flowering time. They share the common upstream regulators CONSTANS (CO), a key component in the long
day pathway, and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a flowering repressor integrating autonomous and vernalization pathways [10]. FLC suppresses flowering, at least in
part, by repressing the expression of the floral activators
SOC1 and FT, and it has been shown to bind directly to
these activators [14,15]. LFY is a key player in the specification of floral meristem identity [16], and it dramatically increased the number of coflorescences in a lfy
mutant due to the activity of AP1 [7]. Thus, crosstalk
between pathways might explain how the multiple signals affecting flowering are coordinated, and differences
in how pathways are integrated might underlie the
diversity of plant flowering [3,6,17].
Regulation of flowering in woody perennials shows
remarkable differences with respect to herbaceous species. Annual plants complete their life cycle in one
year and initiate flowering only once, whereas most
other fruit crops have a long juvenile period, during
which no reproductive development occurs. After this
period, however, flowering happens repeatedly. How
perennial woody plants undergo a long silent juvenile
stage and then repeated vegetative growth and flowering has not been extensively studied at the level of
transcription [17].
Citrus is one of the most widespread fruit crops in the
world, with great economic and health value [18]. It is
among the most difficult plants to improve through traditional breeding approaches due to undesirable reproductive traits and characteristics [19]. These include
degrees of sexual sterility and incompatibility, nucellar
embryony, extended juvenility, and large plant size. To
accelerate flowering time, constitutive expression of LFY
or AP1 derived from Arabidopsis was used to dramatically reduce generation time in citranges [20]. In a similar approach, but with a citrus gene, it was shown that
transgenic poncirus carrying the CiFT (an FT homolog)
also exhibited early flowering, although this phenotype
was accompanied by several pleiotropic effects [21]. In
addition, the long juvenile phase (6 to 8 years) of most
citrus genotypes impedes the rapid evaluation of transgenic trees modified to affect adult traits such as fruit
quality (e.g., rind and flesh color, flavors, maturity dates,
seediness, abscission, peelability, rag content, acid and
sugar levels) and other traits associated with productive
mature trees. Thus, understanding the molecular

Page 2 of 20

regulation of the flowering process is crucial for controlling fruit production in citrus.
In 1976, precocious trifoliate orange with a short juvenile phase, a spontaneous mutant (MT) derived from
Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf, was found in Yichang, Hubei
province, China. In contrast to the 6- to 8-year juvenile
period of the wild-type (WT) trifoliate orange, almost all
of the seedlings that germinated from the MT had only
a 3-year juvenile period; 20% of the seedlings even flowered in the year after germination. The MT seedlings
can flower two to three times per year, while the WT
plant flowers only once per year. The MT and the WT
had nearly the same morphological characteristics aside
from flowering habit, and no DNA polymorphisms were
detected between them. Consequently, the MT was
speculated to be a direct variant of the WT, which was
ideal for studying floral induction, inflorescence development, and the flowering molecular mechanism.
Therefore, a transcriptional study including a cDNA
macroarray in combination with suppression subtraction
hybridization (SSH) was used to investigate gene expression changes in the MT, and a total of 368 differentially
expressed genes were detected [22-25]. Interestingly,
most of the 368 genes showed differential expression in
the year after self-pruning, indicating that this period is
a critical stage for the transcriptional regulation of the
MT trait formation. Taken together, our previous
research using SSH technology has provided important
clues for understanding the formation of the mutation
trait in precocious trifoliate orange; however, the transcriptional information from SSH, especially for genes
expressed at low levels, is rather limited. Further analyses of gene expression during the early flowering process is needed.
Massively parallel signature sequencing technology
(MPSS), like expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and serial
analysis of gene expression (SAGE), is a sequence-based
method that can be used for transcriptional profiling to
measure gene expression. However, MPSS provides
more thorough qualitative and quantitative descriptions
of gene expression due to its tremendous depth [26-30].
This depth enables identification of a nearly complete
inventory of transcripts in a given sample [31]. To date,
the MPSS method has provided a rapid way to identify
and profile differentially expressed genes in a variety of
plants, mutants, and tissues, and at different stages of
development [28,30-32]. In this study, a genome-wide
gene expression study was carried out between WT and
precocious trifoliate orange by using MPSS, and a total
of 36,523 genes were analyzed. Of these genes, 2735
showed a twofold or greater expression difference
between the MT and WT. The results demonstrated
that some genes may be newly transcribed in the MT.
Our results also identified a large number of genes

previously not known to be involved in the early flowering development process. Interpretation of the data solidified links between new information herein and our
previous fragmentary knowledge, and provided new
insight into the molecular processes regulating flowering
time in citrus.

Results
Flowering characterization of WT and precocious trifoliate
orange

Self-pruning is a physiologic phenomenon in trifoliate
orange in which shoots cease vegetative growth by automatically withering the shoot tip (0.5-1 cm, Figure 1b
and 1e). Self-pruning is a necessary but insufficient condition for floral bud initiation. Until the late stage of
self-pruning, the shoot apical meristem of juvenile trifoliate orange is in an undetermined state and floral primordia are not observed (October, Figure 1b). After
self-pruning, the terminal bud and lateral buds of the
juvenile trees enter dormancy until late February of the
next year (Figure 1c). (In citrus, there are three flushes
during the growing season. The spring flush is the most
important one for growth and flower formation; these
lateral buds develop into spring shoots in the next year.)
A major characteristic of the MT is that its juvenile
phase is shortened to 1 to 2 years, whereas the WT
plant has a long juvenile period of 6 to 8 years. This
“nonapparent” growth period is important for flower

induction and the transition from the vegetative to the
flowering stage of precocious trifoliate orange. Cytological observation revealed that the floral buds in the precocious mutant initiated differentiation immediately
after self-pruning on spring shoots (Figure 1d-1f). Floral
development hastened differentiation and produced the
primordia of sepal, petal, stamen, and pistil sequentially.
The whole flower bud integrates formation in one
month, and then part of the flower bud population
began to flower (Figure 1i-1m). However, most flower
buds fell into dormancy until late February of the next
year. For WT trifoliate orange, the spring shoots, which
did not form floral buds, began to produce vegetative
buds after self-pruning (Figure 1g and 1h).
MPSS signature abundance and distribution

MPSS libraries were constructed using RNA extracted
from the terminal bud and the five following buds of
spring shoots (after self-pruning) for the MT and the
WT. A total of 16,564,500 and 16,235,952 successful
reads were produced for MT and WT, respectively
(Table 1). The sequence sets were filtered to remove
low quality reads containing ambiguous nucleotides
and adaptor sequences in both libraries, resulting in
16,067,565 (97.00%) clean reads for MT and
15,701,789 (96.71%) clean reads for WT (clean reads
are termed as “signature” hereafter). The signature
sets were filtered to remove any signatures that were

not 1) reliable, i.e., observed in only one sequencing
run, and 2) not significant, i.e., never observed at or
above 3 transcripts per million (TPM) in either
library. Of the 16,067,565 signatures for MT, 34.2%
(5,490,689) did not meet the reliability criterion (Table
1). Meanwhile, of the 15,701,789 signatures of the WT
library, 33.0% (5,175,486) did not meet the reliability
criterion. After filtering, 10,576,876 reliable signatures
were observed in the MT library, with 10,527,303 reliable signatures in the WT library. The final set of reliable and significant signatures comprised 31,468
unigenes for the MT library and 29,864 unigenes for
the WT library. When the data from the two libraries
were combined, a total of 36,523 nonredundant unigenes were observed. Of these, 6,859 were not
observed in the WT library and 5,055 were not present in the MT library (Table 1).
We found that MPSS was able to detect many transcripts expressed at low levels. Figure 2 shows the distribution of MPSS signatures at different abundance levels
in TPM. The distribution of signature abundances
across both libraries was generally quite similar. Three
signatures in MT and four signatures in WT were
expressed at a high abundance (more than 0.1%, or >
1000 TPM). While the number of signatures increased
dramatically with a decrease in abundance, 74.88% of
the total signatures in MT and 73.56% of the total signatures in WT had an abundance of less than 0.0001%
(Figure 2). Moreover, of the signatures present in a
given library, the vast majority, 93% of the WT library
and 98% of the MT library, were below 0.001% abundance (< 100 TPM) (Figure 2). This illustrates the sensitivity of next generation sequencing technology in
identifying transcripts with low expression. Of the total
signatures, 1.6% of them were not found in the MT
library and 1.7% of them were not found in the WT
library (Figure 2).

Differential expression of MPSS signatures between MT
and WT plants

The frequency of signatures was regarded as the relative
expression level of each transcript in MT and WT
libraries. Comparative analyses of the signature frequencies between MT and WT revealed that the expression
ratio (MT/WT) varied greatly from 0.009 to 318. Only
3.6% signatures were species specific, in that they were
found only in one library and were absent from the
other (expression ratio = 0, Figure 3). Of the common
signatures in both libraries, only 26.5% of all signatures
(9670) showed a twofold or greater (ratio > 2 or < 0.5)
expression difference between MT and WT, and were
regarded as differentially expressed transcripts according
to the criteria defined by Meyers et al. [33]. Of these,
19.9% had expression ratios between 2 and 5, and only a
small percentage of signatures (3.6%) showed more than
a fivefold difference in expression level between the two
libraries (Figure 3). Signature frequency was also compared statistically between the two libraries using the Zscore method according to Kal et al. [34], which uses
the p-value and a statistical significance value. The
expression of 2,735 signatures was significantly different
at p < 0.005, at the same time their expression ratios
were greater than 2 or less than 0.5 (Figure 4). Among
these, 1000 genes were down-regulated in the MT compared to the WT and 1735 genes were up-regulated. Of
these 2735 signatures, 1855 (23%) were significant at p
< 0.001.
Length distributions and functional annotation of
unigenes

The average length of unigenes was 674.41 and
665.35bp for the WT and MT library, respectively,
which is shorter than those of Arabidopsis (1445bp) and
soybean (1539bp) [35,36]. The median value for the
length of the unigenes was 1020 and 1002bp for the
WT and MT library, respectively, which is shorter than
Arabidopsis (1459bp) and rice (1548bp) [37], but longer
than poplar (990bp) [38]. The average length of the
open reading frame was 718 and 711 bp, corresponding
to an average polypeptide length of 239 and 237aa,
respectively, which was also shorter than those of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean, and longer than poplar and
maize [39,40]. Additional File 1 provides the distributions of cDNA length and the CDS length from 31,468
and 29,864 nonredundant unigene sequences,
respectively.
Our annotation method was based on sequence
homology searches and the annotations that accompanied them. Its aim was to capture the most informative
and complete annotation possible. Table 2 shows the hit
numbers and percentages relative to those of the major
public databases. These annotation statistics show all

the unigenes annotated by the BLAST search against the
public protein and nucleotide databases (SwissProt,
KEGG, COG, and Nr) where the E-value threshold was
set at 1E-5. Of the 31,468 MT and 29,864 WT unigenes,
23,835 and 23,076 unigenes had at least one hit within
these databases, respectively (Table 2). The remaining
unigenes (24.26% and 22.73%, respectively) that were
not annotated likely comprised citrus-specific genes, as
well as genes with homologs in other species whose corresponding biological functions have not yet been investigated. In addition, proteins with the highest ranks in
the BLAST results were taken to decide the coding
region sequences of the unigenes, and the coding region
sequences were then translated into amino sequences
with a standard codon table. Consequently, both the
nucleotide sequences (5’-3’) and amino sequences of the
unigene coding region were acquired. Unigenes that
cannot be aligned to any database were scanned by
ESTScan [41] to get the nucleotide (5’-3’) and amino
sequences of the coding regions. A total of 25,318 genes
(12,064 in sense and 12,254 in antisense) were identified
in the MT library (Additional File 2), and 22,510 genes
(11,681 in sense and 11,892 in antisense) were identified
in the WT library (Additional File 3); a total of 7,150
(22.72%) for the MT and 6,354 (21.28%) for the WT
library were not identified in sense or antisense. Transcription factors (TFs) are important regulators for activating or repressing the expression of coding or

noncoding genes, through which they can further influence or control many biological processes [42]. Putative
TF genes were identified by a BLAST search against
rice, Arabidopsis, and Citrus sinensis TF genes downloaded from PlantTFDB (http://planttfdb.cbi.pku.edu.
cn:9010/index.php) [43], identifying 569 putative TFs
belonging to 60 TF families; there were 552 TFs in the
WT library and 564 TFs in the MT library (Additional
File 4). The MADS family was the most prevalent, followed by the AP2/EREBP and WRKY families. These
results were slightly different from those of Arabidopsis
[33] and rice [30], in which the AP2/EREBP family and
zinc finger family were predominant, respectively. In
addition, the AP2/EREBP family and C2H2 family were
slightly differentially expressed between the genotypes
(Additional File 4).
Functional classification of differential expression genes

As a result of the completed genomic sequencing of the
plant Arabidopsis, the currently available expressed
sequences have been invaluable in defining the correct
components of the gene structure in this species [44].
To evaluate the potential functions of genes with significant transcriptional changes between the MT and WT,
Gene Ontology (GO) categories were assigned to the
significant 2735 genes based on the TAIR GO slim provided by blast2GO. The categorization of differential
expression genes according to the cellular component,

molecular function, and biological process is shown in
Figure 5. With regard to cellular component, the analysis revealed a high percentage of cell parts and organelles. For categories based on molecular function, the
genes were finally classified into eight categories, as
shown in Figure 5B; the three most overrepresented GO
terms were binding (nucleotide binding, protein binding,
chromatin binding), catalytic, and transcription regulators. Differential expression genes were related to 17
biological processes, including cellular process, biological regulation, metabolic process, developmental process,
response to stimulus, multicellular organismal process,
and others (Figure 5C). The biological interpretation of
the significant differential expression genes was further
completed using KEGG pathway analyses (Additional
File 5). A total of 200 different metabolic pathways were
found in this study, with some being consistent with
biological processes already revealed by GO analyses.
The most represented pathways included metabolic
pathways (168 enzymes represented), biosynthesis of
secondary metabolites (100), plant-pathogen interaction
(65), phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (45), spliceosome
(38), and cell cycle (26). Of these, some were related to
mutation trait formation based on previous knowledge,
including biosynthesis of plant hormones, spliceosome,

RNA degradation, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and
calcium signaling pathway. In addition, GO representations from this study were compared with a GO representation based on all the unigenes from sweet orange
in the TIGR gene index database, and no significant differences were seen between the two groups.
Identification of flowering-related genes

There are physical, chemical, and biological signals that
lead to the onset of flowering. The four known pathways
that respond to these signals have been characterized in
Arabidopsis and some herbaceous model plants. In
order to identify flowering-related differential expression
genes in this study, putative functions of 36,523 nonredundant signatures were assessed by BLAST searches
against the TAIR9, RAP-DB, and NCBI Nr protein datasets. We identified 110 citrus unigenes representing
putative homologs to flowering-related genes. Some of
these genes are required for the day length response and
some encode regulatory proteins specifically involved in
the control of flowering, while others encode components of light signal transduction pathways or are
involved in circadian clock function. A representation of
the relationships among these processes is shown in Figure 6 and the putative homologs of the key players in

Figure 6 Pathways regulating the floral transition in Arabidopsis [68,69]. Long photoperiod and gibberellic acids (GAs) promote the floral
transition by activating the floral pathway integrators. The enabling pathways regulate floral competence of the meristems by regulating floral
repressor activity such as the FLC. Arrows indicate activation and short lines ending with a dot indicate repression. The data underlying the
model and the corresponding homologs in citrus are presented in Table 1. A plus sign (+) indicates up-regulation and a minus sign (-) indicates
down-regulation in precocious trifoliate orange. Genes in red type were not found by MPSS.

citrus are presented in Table 3. For example, we found
some putative homologs for floral integrator or identity
gene such as FT, SOC1, FLC, CO, and AP1.
Most genes of the Arabidopsis photoperiodic pathway
were found in 36,523 nonredundant unigenes. We
found several genes encoding putative photoreceptor
apoproteins including Phytochrome A-C, Cryptochrome
1-3, ZEITLUPE (ZTL), and FLAVIN BINDING KELCH
REPEAT F-BOX 1 (FKF1) (Table 3). In addition to
genes of the photoperiodic pathway, homologs for both
known sequences belonging to light quality pathways,
PHYTOCHROME AND FLOWERING TIME 1 (PFT1)
and RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6 (REF6), were

found. Of the central circadian clock genes, homologs of
LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and TIMING
OF CAB 1 (TOC1) were also present in the two libraries
(Table 3), but CCA1 was lacking. Furthermore, we
found seven citrus unigenes that showed significant
similarity to the Arabidopsis CO; these sequences were
initially organized in six clusters. Among the regulators
of CO transcription and protein stability, GIGANTEA
(GI) was identified in the two libraries (Table 3).
For the vernalization pathway, we were not able to
find MAF-like sequences (MAF1-MAF5: MADS
AFFECTING FLOWERING1-5) from our libraries by
BLAST searches (Table 3). However, we identified

SVP (Poncirus trifoliata)
TFL2 (Malus × domestica)

several homolog genes belonging to the FRIGIDA (FRI)
complex as well as other regulatory complexes (FRIGIDA-ESSENTIAL1, SUPPRESSOR OF FRIGIDA4, and
MINIDEPENDENS) involved in regulating the expression of FLC. Also putative members of FLC repressing
the PRC complex were present in the two libraries.
These included putative VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3 (VIN3), FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT
ENDOSPERM (FIE), EMBRYONIC FLOWER 1 (EMF1),
VERNALIZATION 1 (VRN1), and LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (LHP1). In addition, a putative
homolog for FLOWERING LOCUS D (FLD) sequence
was identified in this study (Table 3); FLD plays a key
role in regulating the reproductive competence of the
shoot and results in different developmental phase transitions in Arabidopsis. Lesions in FLD result in hyperacetylation of histones in FLC chromatin, up-regulation
of FLC expression, and extremely delayed flowering [45].
In addition to the photoperiod and the vernalization
pathways, we searched candidate genes for autonomous
and GA pathways. Several sequences corresponding to
Arabidopsis genes from both pathways were identified,
suggesting the presence of these pathways in citrus.
Among these genes we found homologs for Arabidopsis
FVE and SVP, which have been shown to control flowering in a specific thermosensory pathway. Moreover,
some additional flowering-time regulators that have not
been placed in any specific pathway were identified,
such as the MADS transcription factor family genes,
SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN family
genes, AGAMOUS family genes, and SEPALLATA family
genes (Table 3).
Differential expression of flowering genes between the
MT and WT plants

We compared the expression of selected flowering-time
genes corresponding to each flowering pathway in the MT
library and the WT library in order to explore the role of

different pathways. Almost all flowering-related genes
were differentially expressed between the genotypes; only
a few of the genes were specifically expressed (Table 3). Of
these, AP1 was not observed in the WT library, although a
citrus AP1 had previously been identified [46]. The AP1
specifies flower meristem identity and is also required for
normal development of sepals and petals. In the MT
library, most flowering-promoting genes had slightly upregulated expression compared with the WT library, such
as FLD, PFT1, and SEP1. Floral integrator genes (FT,
SOC1, and FLC) were clearly up-regulated in the MT
library (Figure 6). On the other hand, most repressors of
flowering genes were slightly down-regulated in the WT
library compared with the MT library (Figure 6).
Verification of the genes related to MT trait formation

Transcriptional regulation revealed by MPSS data was
confirmed in a biologically independent experiment
using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR). A total of 30 genes were chosen to design gene-specific primers (Additional File 6);
these genes included 26 significantly differentially
expressed genes, two genes of no differential expression,
and two genes encoding proteins previously reported to
be associated with, or involved in, developmental processes in other species. The transcript abundance patterns of the MT and WT were compared with MPSS
data. Results showed that for 28 of the 30 genes, realtime PCR revealed the same expression tendency as the
MPSS data, despite some quantitative differences in
expression level. Figure 7 showed differential expression
levels for 28 genes (20 for induced, three for repressed,
three for antisense, and two previously reported flowering-related genes) between MT and WT. For example,
the floral integrator gene FT was up-regulated 1.7 times
in MT compared with WT as analyzed by real-time
PCR, consistent with MPSS data showing that the gene’s
expression in the MT was threefold higher than in the

Zhang et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:63

WT. Furthermore, the expression profile of six genes,
including some citrus putative homologs for floral integrator or identity genes (SOC1 and AP1), and three
other newly detected genes with significant transcriptional changes were analyzed at six stages during flowering development between the MT and WT (Figure 8).
As expected, the expression of these genes was correlated with floral induction, inflorescence development,
and flowering of precocious trifoliate orange. It is notable that the expression levels of induced genes were upregulated in the spring shoot apex samples of WT and
MT genotypes before the floral initiation had occurred
and repressed genes were down-regulated (Figure 8).

Discussion
We explored expression patterns at a specific stage of
flowering development in an early flowering trifoliate
orange mutant by MPSS. MPSS and ESTs can be used
for quantitative measurements of gene expression when
combined with genomic sequencing [28,29]. Both
approaches describe similar patterns of transcript abundance, although there are some clear differences that are
perhaps associated with the methods themselves. Compared with EST technologies, MPSS involves deep transcript sampling and sequencing, usually 1-2 million
transcripts per library, of a cDNA library on microbeads
[29]. In principle, the MPSS data should provide a more
thorough and quantitative representation of the absolute
transcript population in terms of representation and
relative abundance than EST data [28,30,47,48]. When
compared with microarray technology that requires previous knowledge of genes, the limitations to detecting
unknown genes are not encountered in MPSS [48,49].
On the other hand, compared to microarrays, a highthroughput sequencing approach is technologically more
complex, yet much simpler statistically and methodologically [50]. The technology has been shown to provide
comprehensive coverage and a sensitive measure of gene
expression [51,52]. MPSS profiling has been used in studies to address various biological questions, including a
whole-genome transcript analysis in Arabidopsis [53]
and in human [51], and transcript expression profiling
of hybrid and inbred parents in oyster [54]. From the
results of this study, it is apparent that MPSS analyses
not only highlight some genes and biological processes
already revealed by our previous macroarray data
[23,24], but also reveal a large number of genes that are
possibly involved in the formation of the early flowering
trait. The data consistency from multiple approaches
ensures that the MPSS data produced in this study are
reliable. In addition, the approximately 3.6 × 108 base
pairs of data produced here represent a substantial
sequence resource and will contribute to genomic data
available for citrus.

To understand the transcriptome profile and to isolate
flowering-related genes during flowering development in
citrus, genome-wide gene expression profiling was compared between WT and precocious trifoliate orange by
using MPSS. The results revealed 2735 differentially
expressed genes that were induced or repressed more
than twofold in the MT at the 0.05% significance level.
We identified a large number of newly discovered, intriguing unigenes of transcription and post-transcription
factors in these differentially expressed genes, indicating
that these genes may be key regulators that control
flowering development by activating or repressing
numerous genes (Figure 7). Additionally, a number of
putative homologs of genes for flowering time and floral
organ identity were also found. To obtain additional
insights into the functions of the differentially expressed
genes, we examined the GO categorization for the most
similar Arabidopsis homologs of each gene using functions within the TAIR website. Functional category analyses revealed that a number of important pathways may
work collaboratively in shaping the early flowering trait
in the MT. Genes encoding proteins categorized as
including binding (nucleotide binding, protein binding,
and chromatin binding), biological regulation, and developmental processes were enriched among those genes
differentially expressed between the WT and the MT.
We found a large proportion of “no homology” and
similarity to unknown proteins sequences in the GenBank database. The underlying genetics of flower induction and floral organ formation may differ between
woody perennials and herbaceous model species. Some
of these genes may play important roles from the vegetative phase to floral development in MT. In addition, a
high proportion of antisense transcripts, i.e., 12,254 of
25,318 genes in MT and 11,892 of 22,510 genes in WT,
were observed in our study. These results suggested that
the early flowering trait could be regulated on transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. In contrast, the
MPSS data provided much more information for the
regulation of these activities on the transcriptional level.
A notable result is that a considerable percentage of the
genes, 9% of the total annotated genes, were involved in
the regulation of biological processes or transcription
(Figure 5). The induction of regulatory genes of transcription correlates well with the increased overall transcription in the MT. The total number of transcribed
genes in the MT was 31,468, more than in the WT
(29,864), suggesting that newly initiated transcription
occurs in the MT. Moreover, analyses of the genes with
transcription changes greater than twofold showed that
up-regulated genes constituted 63.4% of the total changed genes. This suggests that these genes are related to
uncharacterized mechanisms in the perception of signals
and the initiation of flowering development.

For comprehensive identification of candidate genes in
the citrus flowering pathways, we were able to identify
110 homolog genes among about 36,523 unigene
sequences, representing putative citrus homologs to

flowering-time genes (Table 3, Additional file 7).
Sequences found in citrus corresponded to all known
Arabidopsis flowering-time pathways, suggesting that all
of these genetic pathways may be present in citrus.

Figure 8 Transcript level of six selected genes at different stages of spring shoot development in the mutant (black columns) and
wild-type (grey columns). Stage 1: After self-pruning (undetermined lateral bud); Stage 2: Sepal primordia arise; Stage 3: Petal primordia arise;
Stage 4: Stamen primordia arise; Stage 5: Pistil primordia arise; Stage 6: Fully developed floral bud. Relative transcript levels are calculated by realtime PCR with Actin as a standard. Data are means ± SE of three separate measurements.

Exogenous GAs have been shown to inhibit flower bud
formation not only in citrus [55] but also in apples [56],
pears [57], and cherries and peaches [58]. This hormone
is thus believed to strongly participate in regulating
flower bud formation. Many GA biosynthetic and catabolism-related genes were also found in this study; however, we did not find clear differences in the expression
of GA biosynthetic and catabolism-related genes in the
spring shoot apex samples of WT and MT genotypes
before floral initiation occurred. So these data do not
support the role of the GA pathway as the regulator of
early flowering process in the MT, indicating that GA
signal may be regulated during flowering development
of the two gene types rather than only in the MT.
In Arabidopsis, the floral induction signals from these
four major flowering pathways (photoperiod, autonomous, vernalization, and GA-induced pathways) are
transmitted to three flowering pathway integrators, FT,

SOC1, and LFY. When SOC1 is induced at the shoot
apex, SOC1 together with AGL24 directly activates LFY.
AP1, activated mainly by FT, is also necessary to establish and maintain flower meristem identity [59]. When
LFY and AP1 are established, flower development occurs
at the anlagen of the shoot apical meristem according to
the ABC model. During early flower development, AP1
activates the A function and represses three redundantly
functioning flowering time genes, SOC1, AGL24, and
SVP to prevent floral reversion. During late flower
development, such repression is also necessary to activate SEPALATA3 (SEP3) which is a coactivator of B and
C function genes with LFY; otherwise SEP3 is suppressed by SOC1, AGL24, and SVP [59]. We have found
citrus homologs for all of these genes except LFY and
AGL24 in this study; one of the flowering-promoting
genes was up-regulated in the MT library compared
with the WT library (Table 3). Nevertheless, it is clear

Zhang et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:63
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/63

that the citrus genome contains orthologs to LFY.
Accordingly, overexpressing the citrus LFY DNA
sequence dramatically induced early flowering in transgenic Arabidopsis [46]. Expression analysis of LFY by
real-time RT-PCR showed that a transcript level of the
gene was significantly up-regulated in the MT before
the floral initiation had occurred (Figure 7). Therefore,
we speculated that LFY is necessary to induce early
flowering of precocious trifoliate orange. Citrus homologs for SOC1, FT, and AP1 were isolated previously
and evaluated for their function in citrus or Arabidopsis
[21,46,60,61]. They play important roles from the vegetative phase to floral development in citrus. FT is a
member of a small gene family in Arabidopsis that also
contains TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1). Although
TFL1 has been functionally characterized in citrus, we
were not able to identify TFL1 sequences in this study.
Our previous work also revealed that a large portion of
the promotion of flowering by FT and TFL1 was
achieved through down-regulation of TFL1 levels and
up-regulation of FT levels in the MT [24]. One possible
explanation for why these previously reported floweringrelated genes were not discovered in our library is that
their mRNA transcript levels were too low to be measured by sequencing.
In Arabidopsis, CO encodes a zinc finger protein that
acts as a floral activator and mediates the photoperiod
pathway, whereas FLC encodes a MADS box protein
that acts as a floral repressor and mediates the autonomous and vernalization pathways. CO and FLC regulate
the expression of downstream genes, FT, SOC1, and
LFY (Amasino 2010; Parcy 2005; Simpson and Dean
2002). We have identified seven unigenes showing significant (E-value lower than E-10) similarity to the Arabidopsis CO in two libraries. However, only a few of the
CO-like genes were differentially expressed between the
genotypes. Valverde et al. (2004) showed that the CO
protein is ubiquitinated and then degraded by a protein
complex called the proteasome, and that this process is
regulated [62]. The autonomous and vernalization pathways promote flowering by repressing FLC expression
and many genes involved in the vernalization and autonomous pathways control the epigenetic status of the
FLC chromatin [14]. Although FLC homologous MADS
box genes have been recently found from several eudicot
lineages by phylogenetic analysis [63], FLC homologous
genes have not been identified in any woody plants
except citrus. Previous work in this mutant showed that
specific splice variants of FLC were associated with transition from juvenile to mature trees, and four alternatively spliced transcripts of FLC were isolated [22]. In
this study, not only were alternatively spliced transcripts
of putative FLC homolog found, but FRI homologs
could also be found in the MT library and the WT

Page 16 of 20

library. FLC was up-regulated in the MT library compared with the WT library, and the FRI expression pattern was contrary to that of FLC. Our previous work
provided evidence that the expression profile of FLC
was up-regulated during the winter, followed by a
decrease in the spring and summer. This kind of cycling
differs from the pattern observed in Arabidopsis [22]. A
possible hypothesis suggests that due to the alternative
splicing of PtFLC in citrus, which exerts its function in
certain transcript form in the particular development
stage, the total expression level of PtFLC was dispersed.
Additionally, some sequences were found within the two
libraries that would code for the other elements of the
vernalization pathway: VRN1, VRN2, and VRN3 [64] or
for the VIP3. VRN2 has a repressible role over the
expression of FLC and codes for a protein with homology to PcG proteins [65]. These results indicate that the
vernalization pathway may be present in citrus. Meanwhile, these data also suggested that these genes may
play a critical role in the early flowering process of precocious trifoliate orange.

Conclusions
In this study, we used the MPSS method to monitor
global transcriptional changes in the MT compared with
the WT, and identified 2735 differentially expressed
genes that were induced or repressed more than twofold
in the MT at 0.05% significance level. MPSS data analysis uncovered a large number of genes that were not
previously known to be involved in formation of the
mutation trait. A number of new genes possibly related
to flowering time were found in this study. In addition,
we explored 110 putative components for the genetic
flowering pathways in citrus by identifying homologs of
Arabidopsis flowering-time genes. The expression of
selected flowering-time genes corresponding to each
flowering pathway were compared in the MT library
and the WT library, most flowering-promoting genes
had up-regulated expression in the MT library, while
most repressors of flowering genes had down-regulated
expression in the MT library. These data also indicate
that all known genetic flowering pathways may be present in citrus. The function of these elements can now
be tested in heterologous systems, such as Arabidopsis,
via transgenic approaches. We believe our results will be
a valuable source for future research on the control of
flowering and of biennial fruit-bearing patterns in citrus.
Methods
Plant material and RNA preparation

Wild-type and precocious trifoliate orange trifoliate
orange samples were collected from the experimental
fields of the National Citrus Breeding Center at Huazhong Agricultural University. The seeds of WT and

Zhang et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:63
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/63

precocious trifoliate orange trifoliate orange were
planted in 20-cm pots containing a potting mix of a
commercial medium and perlite at a ratio of 3:1. The
juvenile potted seedlings were then transplanted and
grown under field conditions. These juvenile trees were
watered regularly with a nutrient solution. The terminal
bud and the five following buds (the major node position for flower formation) from spring flushes of these
MT and WT trees were collected after self-pruning,
sepal primordia arise, petal primordia arise, stamen primordia arise, pistil primordia arise, and full-developed
floral bud, respectively. All materials were collected
from three individual plants and immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until analyzed.
Total RNA was extracted according to a previous protocol [23]. A 1.2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium
bromide, was run to preliminarily indicate the integrity
of the RNA. All RNA samples were quantified and
examined for protein contamination (A 260/280 ) and
reagent contamination (A 260/230 ) by a Nanodrop ND
1000 spectrophotometer. In addition, the RIN (RNA
integrity number) determined by the Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer was greater than 8.5 for all
samples.
Massively parallel signature sequencing

The materials used for MPSS analyses were the terminal bud and the five following buds from MT and
WT spring shoots after self-pruning, which occurs in
mid-April (our previous results indicated that selfpruning is the critical stage for floral differentiation).
Twenty micrograms of total RNA were sent to Beijing
Genomics Institute (Shenzhen, China) where the
libraries were produced and sequenced using Illumina’s Genome Analyzer (Solexa). The MPSS was carried out essentially as in previous studies [29,66], with
modifications from Long SAGE [67]. Briefly, cDNA
with polyA/T tail was prepared and digested with
DpnII restriction enzyme. An adaptor with an MmeI
recognition site was ligated to the 50-end, followed by
MmeI digestion that cut 21-22 bases downstream.
This 21-22 base signature from each transcript was
subsequently cloned by a unique adaptor and loaded
to a microbead. This MPSS profiling process sampled
1-2 million sequenced transcripts per library on
microbeads. Sequenced tags were generated by serial
cutting and ligation of decoding adaptors. Sequencing
runs were done by using two different cleavage steps,
which are two different four-nucleotide sequencing
frames offset by two bases (two-step) or three bases
(three-step) [29]. The abundance of each signature
was normalized to one million (transcripts per million,
TPM) for the purpose of making comparisons between
samples.

MPSS data analyses

To remove reads that might have arisen from errors in
the MPSS procedure, two filters were applied to the
derived reads [30]. The first, the “reliability filter,”
removed low quality reads containing ambiguous
nucleotides or adaptor sequences. The second, the “significance filter,” was intended to remove reads that were
consistently present at background levels, excluding signatures lower than 3 TPM in both libraries according to
the criteria described by Meyers et al. [30].
To link the expressed signatures to known genes from
citrus, the unigene dataset from TIGR gene index database and Harvest database were combined to create a
reference gene dataset. The signatures produced in silico
were stored in the reference read database, through
which the expressed MPSS signatures could be mapped
on the corresponding EST contigs and singletons based
on matches between MPSS signatures and in silico
reads, as described previously [31]. The significance
level of the differences of signature frequency and transcript abundance between the two libraries was analyzed
using the Z-score method according to Kal et al. [34].
Functional assignments of differentially expressed genes

To assign putative functions to differentially expressed
genes between MT and WT, annot8r program was run
locally to BLAST against a reference database that stores
UniProt entries, their associated Gene Ontology (GO),
Enzyme Commission (EC), and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation [56]. The GO
categorization results were expressed as three independent hierarchies for biological process, cellular component, and molecular function [57]. The biological
interpretation of the differentially expressed genes was
further completed by assigning them to metabolic pathways using KEGG [58]. For the identification of pathways
significantly affected by the mutation, we focused on the
metabolite pathways with at least three affiliated genes.
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR verification

Thirty genes were chosen for confirmation by real-time
quantitative RT-PCR with SYBR green I chemistry
(QIAGEN, Germany). Primers for these genes were
designed with the Primer Express software (PE Applied
Biosystems, USA) and tested to ensure amplification of
single discrete bands with no primer-dimers. Product
size was about 180 bp. Total RNA (3 mg) was treated
with 3 U of DNase (Promega, USA) and then used in
first-strand synthesis with an oligo (dT) primer (20-mer)
and reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For real-time PCR, an amount of
cDNA corresponding to 25 ng of input RNA was used
in each reaction. Reactions were performed with the
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix and analyzed in the ABI

Zhang et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:63
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/63

7500 Real-Time System. Real-time PCR products were
amplified with 1 μl of template of the RT reaction mixture, 10 μl of 2 × SYBR Green Master Mix, and 0.5 μl
of forward and reverse primer (10 μmol/μl), with water
to a final volume of 20 μl. The levels of gene expression
were analyzed with ABI 7500 Sequence Detection System Software (PE Applied Biosystems) and normalized
with the results of b-actin. Real-time quantitative PCR
was performed in four replicates for each sample, and
data were indicated as means ± SD (n = 3).
