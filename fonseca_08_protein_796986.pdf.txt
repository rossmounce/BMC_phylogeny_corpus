Abstract
Background: Although homeobox genes have been the subject of many studies, little is known
about the main amino acid changes that occurred early in the evolution of genes belonging to
different classes.
Results: In this study, we report a method for the fast and efficient retrieval of sequences
belonging to the ANTP (HOXL and NKL) and PRD classes. Furthermore, we look for diagnostic
amino acid residues that can be used to distinguish HOXL, NKL and PRD genes.
Conclusion: The reported protein features will facilitate the robust classification of homeobox
genes from newly sequenced bilaterian genomes. Nevertheless, in non-bilaterian genomes our
findings must be cautiously applied. In principle, as long as a good manually curated data set is
available the approach here described can be applied to non-bilaterian organisms as well. Our
results help focus experimental studies onto investigating the biochemical functions of key
homeodomain residues in different gene classes.

Background
Genes that belong to the homeobox family are characterized by the ability to code for a protein that contains a recognizable, although very variable, 'homeodomain',
usually 60 amino acids in length [1,2]. Many of these
genes are transcription factors that play important roles in
the embryonic development of bilaterian and non-bilaterian animals. Changes in homeobox gene content and
deployment during evolution may have contributed to
the evolution of body plan differences in animals [3-5].
Therefore, comparison of homeobox gene sets from different animals may shed light on the evolutionary events
that gave rise to animal body plan diversity. Nevertheless,
gene orthology is not always easy to establish when com-

paring divergent animals [6]. For this purpose, phylogenetic analysis, conservation of synteny, paralogy within
the human genome, insertions within the homeodomain,
key amino acid residues, and several motifs outside of the
homeodomain can all be used. These features can also be
used to classify homeobox genes into classes, subclasses
and families. In the latest revision, Holland et al. [6] classified all 235 human homeobox genes into 11 classes
(ANTP, PRD, LIM, POU, HNF, SINE, TALE, CUT, PROS,
ZF and CERS) and 102 gene families. The ANTP class is
further divided into HOXL and NKL subclasses. It should
be noted that the only protein region that can be aligned
in all 102 gene families or 235 genes is the homeodomain
[6].

Here, we report amino acid patterns typical of bilaterian
HOXL, NKL, and PRD genes that can be used to quickly
and efficiently retrieve amino acid sequences belonging to
these classes and subclasses, among hundreds of other
homeodomain sequences. Retrieving a given class or subclass of sequences from many animal genomes may be
thus an easier task than previously thought. However, we
show that these typical amino acid patterns should be
cautiously used when sequences come from non-bilaterian animals.
Since phylogenetic analysis was one of the primary
sources of evidence used to establish the different classes
and sub-classes, it is likely that most of homeobox gene
classes and subclasses represent monophyletic lineages.
Hence, it is conceivable that amino acid changes important for protein function in a given lineage may be
revealed as fixed differences between classes and subclasses. Previous attempts have been made to classify
genes within HOX families [7-9] but not at the level of
whole classes or subclasses. Here, we show that, because
of their chemical properties, amino acid usage is different
in ANTP and PRD classes at five positions. Furthermore, at
nine positions, amino acid usage is different between
HOXL and NKL subclasses. Our findings support the
notion that many chemically important changes happened early in the evolution of homeobox genes, and that
these changes can be used as additional evidence to establish gene orthology. These results can be helpful for experimental studies aimed onto investigating the biochemical
functions of key homeodomain residues in different gene
classes as well.

Methods
Data
We have used the hand-curated data set of Holland et al.
[6], the PROSITE homeodomain data set [10] and the
NCBI database [11].
Identification of amino acid patterns typical of HOXL,
NKL and PRD genes
In order to find amino acid patterns that distinguish genes
from the ANTP subclasses, as well as genes from the PRD
class, from genes belonging to other classes, a fast word
discovery program ([12]; available at [13]) was first used
to find statistically interesting words. The minimum word
length used was two (-m 2) and the minimum number of
sequences where the word should occur (-e) was set to
10% of the number of sequences in the data set being considered. The words found were then filtered to discard
those words that occurred more than three times in more
than one dataset. The software Bioredx ([14]; available at
[13]) was then used to find the largest and more general
amino acid patterns that distinguish two sets of
sequences. This program accepts as input two sequence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/200

files and a word seed. Based on the seed given, tries to find
patterns that occur in one file (referred as the positive file)
and not in the other (referred as the negative file). This
software was used to find patterns that occurred less than
four times in the negative file and considered patterns up
to 20 amino acid residues larger than the initial word
seed.
In the reported amino acid patterns, amino acids listed
within brackets are those allowed at a given position. For
compactness of representation it is also possible to negate
the class. The negation is denoted by "^". In this case, the
amino acid residues listed are the ones that are not
allowed at that particular position. The approach here
used to find amino acid patterns does not use a set of
aligned sequences. Therefore, in order to make sure that
the derived amino acid patterns are found in the same
region of the homeodomain sequence, all sequences
belonging to a given class and sub-classes were aligned
using the PAM 250 scoring matrix [15].
Identification of key amino acid residues
There are many schemes for comparing and grouping
amino acids. Nevertheless, none of them can possibly
capture the vast number of contexts in which amino acids
are found within proteins. The scheme here used is that of
Livingstone and Barton [16], based on the amino acid
properties size, polarity, hydrophobicity, charge, aliphaticity and aromaticity. For each position and property we
calculated the probability of gaining or losing a constraint
using the distribution of the amino acid property's
observed at that position in all sequences considered.
Only changes in the properties values with a probability
of occurrence lower than 5% were considered.
Phylogenetic analyses
A Neighbour-joining tree, using pair-wise deletion, as
implemented in the MEGA software [17] was constructed
in order to classify the set of 918 homeodomain
sequences from a variety of animal species (available at
PROSITE [10]), into the 12 classes and two sub-classes
scheme proposed by Holland et al. [6].

Results
In order to establish a method for fast retrieval of
sequences belonging to a given class or subclass, amino
acid patterns characteristic of different homeobox classes
and subclasses were sought. As a starting point we used
the hand-curated human PRD, NKL and HOXL data sets
compiled by Holland et al. [6]. The homeodomains of
human EN1, EN2, DLX1, DLX2, DLX3, DLX4, DLX5,
DLX6, NOTO, and HOPX are difficult to classify and were
not used in these initial analyses. Therefore, the PRD, NKL
and HOXL data sets contain 49, 39 and 52 sequences,
respectively. Within each of the three data sets, the amino

acid sequences show considerable variation, suggesting
that the human sequences include the majority of amino
acid variability allowed at a given position along the
sequence. This assumption was later tested (see section 2).
1) Amino acid patterns characteristic of the different
human gene classes and sub-classes
Many characteristic amino acid patterns were detected
using the approach described in Material and Methods.
Here, we describe the seven patterns that are most pertinent, taking into account their coverage across a group of
genes and absence in the other groups.

The pattern [KT] [IV]WFQNRR [AMV]K [DEHKLMQWY]
[KR] [KR] (positions 46–58; Fig. 1), named HOXL 1 pattern, is present in all human HOXL homeodomains, and
in none of the human NKL and PRD genes.
The pattern LE [AGKNR]E (positions 16–19; Fig. 1),
named HOXL 2 pattern, is present in all human HOXL
homeodomains except Mnx1. Only two human PRD
genes (Pax4 and Pax6) encode this amino acid pattern.
None of the human NKL genes encode this amino acid
pattern.
The pattern [AKST] [DENPS] [LAST] [Q] [V] (positions
41–45; Fig. 1), named NKL pattern, is present in 36 out of
39 human NKL sequences, in one human HOXL sequence
(Mnx1), and in none of the human PRD sequences. The
human NKL sequences that do not present this pattern
are: HHEX, NANOG, and VENTX.
The pattern L [EINQRV] [^DGHMPTVWY] [^CDGKMNPQR] [FL] [^CFILPTWY] [AEFHKQRV] [ADEGKNSTW]
[CHKMPQR] [FHY]P (positions 16–26; Fig. 1), named
PRD pattern, is present in all human PRD homeodomains
and never present in human HOXL and NKL sequences.
The patterns [HQ] [IV] [AKLT] (positions 44–46; Fig. 1),
named ANTP 1 pattern, and [IKTV] [ITV]W [FY]QN

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/200

[HQR]R [AMNTVY]K, named ANTP 2 pattern, (positions
46–55; Fig. 1) are present in all human HOXL and NKL
genes and never present in human PRD homeodomains.
The pattern W [FY] [KQESR] [NK] [HQRKY] [RW] (positions 48–53; Fig. 1), named ANTP-PRD pattern, is found
in all human PRD, NKL and HOXL homeodomains.
2) Generality of the amino acid patterns found
In order to test the generality of the amino acid patterns
derived in the previous section, we used the 356 homeodomain sequences classified by Holland et al. [6], which
include the 140 human sequences used above. These
sequences include genes classified as HOXL, NKL and
PRD, plus other homeobox gene classes (LIM, POU, HNF,
SINE, TALE, CUT, PROS, ZF, CERS). It should be noted,
that in these analyses, the difficult to classify genes that
were excluded above were now included, and these were
classified as tentatively suggested by Holland et al. [6].
Using amino acid sequences, a neighbour-joining tree
(using pair-wise deletion, as implemented in the MEGA
software; [17]) was built with the 356 sequences, plus 918
homeodomain sequences from a variety of animal species. The latter 918 sequences were obtained from the file
PS50071 available at PROSITE [10] after removing all
non-animal sequences from the file. Sequences from clusters that are supported by a bootstrap value of 80% or
higher, and that include at least one sequence that has
been classified by Holland et al. [6], as belonging to a
given class or subclass, were classified as belonging to that
class or subclass. Using this phylogenetic argument 202
sequences could be classified as HOXL, 204 as NKL, 200
as PRD, 66 as LIM, 83 as POU, 15 as HNF, 23 as SINE, 66
as TALE, 20 as CUT, 3 as PROS, 94 as ZF, and 10 as CERS.
Nevertheless, 288 sequences remained unclassified.

Table 1 shows that HOXL 1 pattern is only found in genes
classified as HOXL and thus is highly specific. It is also
highly representative, because 96% of the HOXL
sequences (194/202) used could be classified as such

using this pattern. Therefore, the requirement to use one
of the amino acid combinations implied by this pattern is
a derived feature that appeared in the HOXL lineage early
in animal evolution. The HOXL sequences that do not
show the expected pattern are: Drosophila melanogaster
AbdB, Drosophila melanogaster btn, Strigamia maritima
Hox3b, Gallus gallus HMD2 (PROSITE annotation), Danio
rerio HXABA (PROSITE annotation), and Salmo salar
HXB2 (PROSITE annotation). These sequences do not
form a closely related subgroup of sequences. For
instance, the Drosophila melanogaster Abd-B and btn genes
belong to two different HOXL gene families. Moreover,
other genes belonging to these families do show the
HOXL 1 amino acid pattern. The Fugu rubripes HXDBB
(PROSITE annotation) and the Gallus gallus HXB8
(PROSITE annotation) sequences are incomplete, and
thus it is not possible to determine whether they show this
amino acid pattern. In addition to the 194 known HOXL
genes showing the HOXL 1 pattern, 178/288 'unclassified'
sequences also had this pattern (Table 1). Since the HOXL
1 pattern is very specific to the HOXL subclass, it is very
likely that the 178 unclassified sequences that show this
pattern are HOXL sequences.
The HOXL 2 pattern is not as specific as the HOXL 1 pattern, since it is observed in about 46% of the genes
belonging to the POU class and in a few NKL (0.5%) and
PRD (8%) genes. All 16 PRD genes showing the HOXL 2
pattern belong to the Pax4/6 gene family, thus it is likely
that this is a case of convergent evolution. The human
POU homeodomains showing HOXL 2 pattern are
POU1F1, POU3F1, POU3F2, POU3F3, and POU3F4. The
latter four genes are closely related, although the POU1F1
gene is distantly related to those genes [6]. Nevertheless,
this is also likely a case of convergent evolution, since the
alternative hypothesis (that the need to use one of the
amino acid combinations implied by the HOXL pattern 2
is an ancestral feature) implies many independent losses.
Therefore we argue that the necessity of using the amino
acid combinations implied by HOXL 2 pattern is a derived
feature that appeared early in the HOXL lineage. Only

three sequences (1.5%) classified as HOXL using a phylogenetic argument, do not show the HOXL 2 pattern,
namely: Drosophila melanogaster exex (the Drosophila Mnx1
orthologue; [18]), human MNX1 and mouse Mnx1
(PROSITE annotation). Mnx1 genes are peculiar in other
ways. For instance, they show both the NKL and HOXL 1
pattern (see below).
The NKL pattern is highly specific but not widely representative of all NKL genes. The pattern is found in 57% of
the sequences classified as belonging to the NKL class
(116/204; Table 1), but in only ten other classified genes
(three HOXL and seven SINE). In addition, 52 of the 288
phylogenetically 'unclassified' genes show the NKL pattern, and of these 36 have already been classified as
belonging to the NKL class by PROSITE (data not shown).
The three HOXL genes with the NKL pattern are the three
Mnx1 genes (from Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus,
and Homo sapiens). Mnx1 genes also show the HOXL 1 pattern that is highly specific for HOXL genes. Thus, it is
unlikely that Mnx1 genes have been misclassified. Therefore, the presence of the NKL pattern in Mnx1 sequences
may be the result of convergent evolution.
The seven SINE sequences where the NKL pattern is found
are SIX3 from Oryzias latipes, Gallus gallus, Mus musculus
and Homo sapiens and SIX6 from Gallus gallus, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens. All SIX human genes cluster together
with a high bootstrap value (97%; [6]). Nevertheless, the
NKL pattern is only observed in the SIX3 and SIX6 genes,
two closely related genes. It is thus, likely a case of convergent evolution. The requirement to use one of the amino
acid combinations implied by the NKL pattern is a derived
feature that appeared likely early in the NKL lineage.
Most of the classified sequences where the NKL pattern is
not found have been annotated by Holland et al. [6], and
PROSITE as belonging to the NANOG, NOTO, VENTX,
EN, DLX, and BARX, families. The EN, DLX and NOTO
genes are difficult to classify. Thus, information on these
genes was not used to derive the NKL amino acid pattern.

The PRD pattern is highly specific, being found only in
sequences classified as PRD, and is also highly representative being found in 86% of the sequences classified as
PRD. The PRD genes that do not show this pattern are D.
melanogaster OdsH, otp, PHDP, Ptx1, IP09201, HOPX genes
from Danio rerio, Homo sapiens, Bos taurus, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Sus scrofa, and Gallus gallus (PROSITE
annotation), human PAX2, PAX5 and PAX8 (which have
partial homeobox sequences), Hydra vulgaris Dmbx, OTP
genes from Heliocidaris erythrogramma, Heliocidaris tuberculata, Lytechinus variegates, Paracentrotus lividus, and Saccoglossus kowalevskii (PROSITE annotation), OTX from
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (PROSITE annotation), ALX
from Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (PROSITE annotation),
ANF genes (PROSITE annotation) from Gallus gallus, and
Xenopus laevis (two genes), and the PROP gene from Canis
familiaris (PROSITE annotation). The PRD sequences that
do not show this pattern are not related in any particular
way. Therefore, the absence of this pattern in these
sequences is likely the result of several independent
losses. Therefore, it seems likely that the requirement to
use one of the amino acid combinations implied by the
PRD pattern is a derived feature that appeared early in the
evolution of PRD genes.
Since the PRD-specific pattern is highly specific, it is likely
that the 14 unclassified sequences that show this pattern
are also PRD sequences. According to PROSITE classification these genes are Gsc from Danio rerio, Xenopus laevis
(two genes), Gallus gallus, Mus musculus, Saguinus labiatus,
Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus, Pan paniscus, and Pan troglodytes, ALX4 from Mus musculus and Bos taurus, and UNC4 and ceh-36 genes from Caenorhabditis elegans (PROSITE
classification). According to PROSITE, 13 of these genes
belong to the PRD class; the status of the ceh-36 gene is
unknown.
The ANTP 1 pattern is found in most HOXL (98%) and
NKL (98%) gene sequences and is almost absent in PRD
(0.5%) gene sequences. Nevertheless, such a pattern is
also found in sequences from genes belonging to all other
classes except the PROS class (Table 1). It should, however, be noted that the sample size of PROS genes is very
small (only three sequences). The ANTP sequences that do
not show this pattern are Drosophila melanogaster eve, lbe,
and lbl, Homo sapiens NOTO, Heterodontus francisci Evx2
(PROSITE annotation), Gallus gallus Hme1 (PROSITE
annotation), Fugu rubripes hxdbb, and Caenorhabditis elegans vab7 and hm31 (PROSITE annotation). The HXB8
gene from Gallus gallus (PROSITE annotation) is incomplete, and thus it is not possible to determine whether it
shows this pattern. The HOPX sequence (PROSITE annotation) from Danio rerio is the only PRD sequence that
shows ANTP 1 pattern.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/200

Although the ANTP 1 pattern is short (only three amino
acid positions long), the broad distribution indicates that,
very likely, it is not the result of convergent evolution. It is
more likely that the ability to use the amino acid combinations implied by this pattern is an ancestral feature of
homeobox containing genes. For some likely functional
reason, ANTP genes have retained such a pattern, in contrast with PRD genes (the outgroup to ANTP genes) where
only 0.5% of all sequences show this pattern.
The ANTP 2 pattern is found in most HOXL (98%) but in
only 68% of the NKL sequences. This pattern is not found
in sequences from other classes. It is thus, highly specific,
although less representative across the NKL subclass of
ANTP class genes. The HOXL genes that do not show this
pattern are (PROSITE annotations) Hmd2 from Gallus gallus, hxaba from Danio rerio, hxb2 from Salmo salar and hxbb
from Fugu rubripes. These sequences are not related in any
particular way. It is not possible to determine whether the
Hxb8 gene from Gallus gallus (PROSITE annotation)
shows this pattern, since this is a partial sequence. NKL
sequences not showing the ANTP 2 pattern belong to the
Dlx (distalless), En (engrailed) and Noto gene families
that have been previously found to be difficult to classify.
Hence, information on these genes was not used to derive
the ANTP 2 pattern. Once again, genes from these families
stand out as oddities (it should be noted that they also do
not show the NKL pattern as well; see above).
The ANTP-PRD pattern identifies most HOXL (99%),
NKL (98%) and PRD (95%) sequences used. Nevertheless, it is also present in all SINE sequences and in 79% of
the LIM sequences. The 16 ANTP plus PRD sequences that
do not show the expected pattern are the HOPX genes
from Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Sus
scrofa, Bos taurus, Gallus gallus, and Danio rerio, the HM31
gene from Caenorhabditis elegans, and the Artemia sanfranciscana HMEN gene. It should be noted that HOPX are difficult to classify, that in the latest revision [6] were
classified as PRD genes, and these were not used to derive
the amino acid patterns being tested. The PAX2, PAX5 and
PAX8 sequences from Homo sapiens, as well as the HXB8
gene from Gallus gallus, the HXDBB gene from Fugu
rubripes, and the DLX2 and DLX4 genes from Eleutherodactylus coqui, are partial, thus it is not possible to determine
whether they show the ANTP-PRD amino acid pattern.
3) Further characterization of NKL genes
Given the failure to identify about 43% of the classified
NKL sequences using the NKL pattern, we performed
additional analyses to see whether the NKL pattern could
be refined to accommodate the members of the NANOG,
NOTO, VENTX, EN, DLX, and BARX, families. The results
are shown in Table 2. When the NKL and refined patterns
are considered, 98% of all NKL sequences could be classi-

fied as such. It should be noted that these refined NKL patterns are almost completely absent in the HOXL, PRD,
LIM, POU, HNF, SINE, TALE, CUT, PROS, ZF and CERS
classes. The 11 HOXL sequences that contain the EN pattern but not the NKL pattern all belong to the Hox1 gene
family. This happens because the EN pattern allows for an
asparagine at position 41. Five out of the six genes that
show the NANOG pattern but not the NKL pattern belong
to the HOXL Gsx gene family. These sequences are found
because the pattern allows for a Lysine at position 43. The
8 HOXL sequences that show a hit when using the VENTX
pattern but not the NKL pattern all belong to the Gbx family. This happens because a Valine is now allowed at position 43. The three CUT genes that show the EN and
VENTX patterns are the Homo sapiens ONECUT1 gene and
the orthologues in Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus.
These sequences show a hit because both patterns allow
for an Isoleucine at position 45.

4) Non-bilaterian homeobox sequences
Only a few non-bilaterian homeobox sequences (those
listed in [6]) are contained in the data sets used. Therefore,
we collected from the NCBI database a set of 251 nonredundant non-bilaterian homeobox sequences that
encompass the regions where the amino acid patterns
here reported are located, and that showed the ANTP-PRD
pattern derived above (see Appendix). Most bilaterian
ANTP and PRD sequences show this ANTP-PRD pattern
(Table 1); furthermore, this pattern is only found in
ANTP, PRD, LIM and SINE sequences (Table 1). Therefore, by imposing the presence of the ANTP-PRD pattern
we hoped to enrich the data set for non-bilaterian ANTP
and PRD sequences. Table 3 summarizes the results. As
expected, of the retrieved gene sequences only one seems
to belong to gene classes other than ANTP, PRD, LIM and
SINE.

Only those non-bilaterian sequences that encompass the regions where the amino acid patterns here described are located, and that showed the
ANTP-PRD pattern were used. In total 251 non-redundant sequences were used (gi numbers are listed in the appendix). Cases where nonbilaterian genes are clearly misidentified when using amino acid patterns are shown underlined (see text for details). Uncl. – unclassified sequences.

Most non-bilaterian genes showing the full NKL or PRD
signature have already been classified as such. Furthermore, the ANTP Demox class found in Demospongiae
and apparently absent in all other animals [19], is characterized by the presence of the ANTP-PRD, and ANTP 1 and
2 patterns, as expected for ANTP genes that do not belong
to the HOXL or NKL lineage (Table 3). Although there are
no true Hox genes in sponges [20], 13 sequences show the
full HOXL signature. Interestingly, all such sequences are
non-annotated, thus they must be hard to classify gene
sequences. One Ephydatia fluviatilis gene has been labeled
as the Msx (NKL) gene. Our pattern analyses show that the
corresponding sequence shows a pattern exclusively
found in the Mnx1 (HOXL) gene family, thus, also suggesting that non-bilaterian sequences with full signatures
may be wrongly identified. About 53% of all non-bilaterian sequences used did not show an easily recognizable
signature. We conclude that the reported amino acid patterns must be cautiously used when applied to sequences
from non-bilaterian animals.
5) Identification of single key amino acid changes in
bilaterian PRD, NKL and HOXL genes
Key amino acid changes that occurred during the evolution of homeobox containing genes may be revealed as
changes affecting a single amino acid position. Thus, we
compared, at each amino acid position, the large HOXL
(202 sequences), NKL (204 sequences) and PRD (200
sequences) data sets described above, for the following
chemical properties: size, charge, polarity, hydrophobicity, aromaticity, and aliphapaty. For completeness, the
178, 52 and 14 sequences that could not be classified
using a phylogenetic argument but that show amino acid
patterns typical of HOXL, NKL and PRD genes were also
used.

Chemical properties observed in more than 99% of the
sequences belonging to one class, and observed in less
than three-quarters of sequences belonging to another

class are shown in Tables 4, 5, and 6. Rules are described
relative to the inferred common ancestor situation of the
two categories being compared. For instance, when comparing PRD and ANTP class genes the rule "not negatively
charged at position 27" means that it was inferred (by
comparison with LIM genes) that the common ancestor to
these two gene classes could use a negatively charged
amino acid at position 27; in this example, ANTP genes
subsequently almost completely lost the ability to use a
negatively charged amino acid, but 94% of PRD genes
retained the use of such an amino acid at this position
(Table 4). An almost complete change in amino acid
usage regarding polarity and hydrophobicity is also
observed for amino acid position 30. Furthermore, about
30% of the PRD genes show a charged amino acid at position 50. HOXL and NKL genes never use charged amino
acids at this position, and this is also the case for LIM
genes, here used as an outgroup to ANTP and PRD genes.
Therefore, the possibility of using a charged amino acid at
position 50 seems to be a derived feature that appeared in
the PRD lineage. This amino acid position has been previously used to sub-classify PRD genes into three categories
[21]. A charged amino acid is found in sequences from
Caenorhabditis elegans, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and
Hydra vulgaris, among others, thus this switch is an event
that happened early in the evolution of PRD genes.
Genes belonging to the HOXL lineage show derived constraints at amino acid positions 14, 15, 28, 33, 47 and 54,
relative to the inferred ancestral state for ANTP class genes
(the PRD data set was used as an outgroup; Table 4). Only
three sequences classified as HOXL do not follow the general pattern for these genes, namely, the HMA2 gene
(PROSITE annotation) from Helobdella triserialis that
shows an aromatic amino acid at position 14, and the
HXB8 and PAL1 genes (PROSITE annotation) from Sus
scrofa and Caenorhabditis elegans, respectively, that show
small amino acids at position 28. No derived single
amino acid constraints were found for the NKL lineage.

Discussion
The amino acid patterns and single key amino acid
changes here identified shed light on some of the major
likely functional changes that occurred during the evolution of the HOXL, NKL and PRD genes. Our results show
that important amino acid changes happened very early in
the evolution of these genes, and thus it is possible to
identify an archetype for bilaterian PRD, ANTP, HOXL
and NKL genes. As with every generalization, however,
some genes do not fit the archetype. Experimental studies
are now needed in order to understand why the archetypes possess such chemical properties. We propose the
following archetypes for homeodomain amino acid
sequences showing the ANTP-PRD pattern (this pattern is
present in 97% of all bilaterian ANTP and PRD
sequences).
PRD genes show the L [EINQRV] [^DGHMPTVWY]
[^CDGKMNPQR] [FL] [^CFILPTWY] [AEFHKQRV]
[ADEGKNSTW] [CHKMPQR] [FHY]P (positions 16–26)
PRD pattern, use a negatively charged amino acid at position 27 (DE) and a less polar or non-polar amino acid
(^RKDENQ) at position 30. About 80% of all animal bilaterian PRD genes follow this description.
ANTP (Demox, HOXL and NKL) genes show the [HQ]
[IV] [AKLT] (positions 44–46) ANTP 1 pattern. In contrast
to PRD genes, ANTP genes do not use a negatively charged
amino acid at position 27 (DE). Furthermore, at position
30, 99.8% of all bilaterian ANTP genes use a polar amino
acid (RKDENQ). 97% of all ANTP bilaterian genes follow
this description (data not shown).
HOXL genes are characterized by the presence of the
HOXL 1 pattern. 96% of all bilaterian HOXL genes show

the [KT] [IV]WFQNRR [AMV]K [DEHKLMQWY] [KR]
[KR] (positions 46–58) HOXL 1 pattern.
NKL genes show the NKL pattern (positions 41–45) or a
NKL derived pattern. About 98% of the bilaterian NKL
genes follow this pattern. If the NKL pattern is generalized
to include the derived NKL patterns then many hits are
observed in other homeodomain classes (data not
shown). This is why several NKL-related patterns are
reported.
The above definitions suggest that the region in between
amino acid positions 16–30 and 44–58 are the most
important for function specificity of genes belonging to
different classes and sub-classes. The former region corresponds to the end of Helix 1, the inter Helix 1–2 region
and to the first positions of Helix 2 [9]. The region in
between amino acid positions 44–58 correspond mainly
to helix 3. This helix, also called recognition helix is essential for successful and specific DNA binding [9].
The situation observed for NKL genes suggest that specific
amino acid patterns may exist for groups of genes within
major classes, as previously suggested [9]. It also indicates
that not all motifs implied by an amino acid pattern occur
in a given homeodomain class. On the other hand, the situation observed for non-bilaterian vs bilaterian genes suggests that we may have failed to identify all relevant
chemical changes. For instance, it is conceivable that
important amino acid changes are observed when the protostome and the deuterostome lineages are compared;
such distinctions were not addressed in this work because
we grouped genes from a given homeodomain class
together, irrespective of the organism.

It is tempting to use these features to classify homeobox
containing genes. Nevertheless, given the very old age of
the gene families considered, the possibility of convergent
evolution must be considered when analyzing a given
amino acid sequence. Therefore, for the purpose of gene
classification, the features here described should not be
decisive but rather used as additional evidence. It should
be noted, that the reconstruction of gene genealogies is a
hard problem, namely when proteins belonging to the
same family share some of the same protein interaction
partners, thus facing a similar selective environment
(Campos et al. 2004). Any additional piece of evidence
that may shed light on the correct classification of genes
should therefore be used.

Conclusion
In this work we report a method for the fast retrieval of
bilaterian ANTP and PRD sequences. Given the availability of a sufficiently large curated data set this method can
be applied to any group of proteins. Furthermore, we
report some of the main amino acid changes that occurred
early in the HOXL, NKL and PRD lineages. These features
can be used for the classification of gene sequences,
although, as shown, convergent evolution must be considered as an explanation for the presence of a given pattern in a sequence. The possibility that the region of the
protein that allows distinguishing the different classes,
also allows the distinction of different families within
classes, has important practical and evolutionary consequences and must be explored in more detail.
