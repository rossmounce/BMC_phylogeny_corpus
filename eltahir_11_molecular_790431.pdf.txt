Abstract
Background: Chicken anemia virus (CAV) is the causative agent of chicken infectious anemia (CIA). A high
prevalence of CAV has been reported in China. However, VP1 sequences of Chinese isolates show no clear
genotype clustering or correlation with geographic origin. Therefore, the present study aimed to detect and
characterize CAV isolates from China based on sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the VP1, VP2 and VP3 genes.
Results: Of 460 spleen samples tested by PCR, 47 (10.22%) were found to be positive for CAV. A total of 25 CAV,
approximately full genomes, from different commercial farms were characterized. Phylogenetic analysis of the
Chinese CAV sequences together with strains from different countries resulted in four distinct groups (A-D) with
significant high bootstrap values. The Chinese viral sequences were located as four different clusters within groups
A and D. All the Chinese CAV genomes characterized in this study had glutamine (Q) at amino acid position 394,
which indicated that all are highly pathogenic. Mutations associated with attenuation and weaker reactivity with
monoclonal antibody 2A9 were absent in the Chinese sequences.
Conclusions: We revealed that CAV prevalence was lower than that reported previously in commercial farms in
China. We also showed four distinct sequence groups (A-D), and genetic variability in local CAV sequences that
could be divided into four groups based on phylogenetic analysis.

Background
Chicken anemia virus (CAV), a member of the family
Circoviridae, is a non-enveloped, icosahedral virus with
a negative-sense, single-stranded circular DNA genome
[1]. The CAV genome consists of 2.3 kb, with three partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) for VP1,
the major viral structural protein (51.6 kDa); VP2, a
scaffolding protein (24 kDa); and VP3, a non-structural
protein named apoptin (13.6 kDa) for its ability to
induce apoptosis; VP1 and VP2 are the main targets of
neutralizing antibodies [2]. The VP1 gene has the highest variability of the three overlapping ORFs, according
to sequences that have been submitted to GenBank [3].
To date, all viruses seem to belong to the same worldwide serotypes. However, because there are currently
only a few full genome sequences available for CAV
strains from the USA, Asia, Australia and Europe, the
emergence of new serotypes cannot be excluded, which

would have important consequences for vaccine efficacy
and serodiagnosis [4].
In China, CAV was first isolated in 1996 from 25-40day-old broilers [5]. A survey in domestic poultry in
farms in 5 Chinese provinces (Beijing, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Tianjin Shi) showed a 42% overall
seroprevalence [6]. On the other hand, in Southeast
China, studies undertaken on live bird markets also
indicated a high prevalence (87%) of the virus [7].
Although considerable numbers of VP1 sequences
from China are available in GenBank, to the best of our
knowledge, no systematic full genome analysis of Chinese strains has been performed. Here, we report the
detection and characterization of CAV genomes based
on sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the entire coding regions (VP1, VP2 and VP3) of the genome from
commercial broiler and layer breeder chickens in China.

36 weeks, during necropsy at veterinary hospitals in
Anhui (n = 51),Fujian(n = 14), Hunan (n = 127) and
Jiangsu (n = 158) provinces. In parallel, 110 spleen samples were collected from 1-7-day-old chickens from four
different commercial farms from Jiangsu province.
Chickens originated from 22 different flocks on commercial farms. Flocks comprised 900-30 000 chickens,
and none of the farms were vaccinated against CAV.
DNA extraction

According to the manufacturer’s instructions, DNA was
extracted from spleen samples using the commercially
available Flexi Gene DNA Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden,
Germany). The DNA was then quantitated and stored at
-20°C until PCR was performed.
Virus detection by PCR

The extracted DNA was first screened by PCR for CAV
DNA using specific primers, CAV1: 5’-GCA GTA GGT
ATA CGC AAG GC-3’ and CAV2: 5’-CTG AAC ACC
GTT GAT GGT C-3’, covering a 186-bp region on the
highly conserved VP2 coding gene [2]. The PCR amplification was carried out in PCR buffer that contained 1.5
mM MgCl2, 200 μM of each dNTP, 10 pmol each primer, and 1.0 U Taq DNA polymerase (Fermentas,
Shenzhen, China) in a 25-μl total reaction volume in an
automated thermal cycler (Gene Amp PCR System
9700, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using
the following cycling profile: initial denaturation of 94°C
for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation, annealing and extension at 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s and
72°C for 1 min, respectively, and the final extension was
carried out at 72°C for 7 min. The PCR products were
then analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and
imaged with the EpiChem system (UVP Bioimaging Systems, Garland, CA, USA).
Amplification of the CAV genome

Primers VP1F: 5’-AGCCGACCCCGAACCGCAAGAA-3’
and VP1R: 5’-TCA GGG CTG CGT CCC CCA GTA
CA-3’ were used to amplify the VP1 region, and VP2F:
5’-GCG CAC ATA CCG GTC GGC AGT-3’ and VP2R:
5’-GGG GTT CGG CAG CCT CAC ACT AT-3’ were
used to amplify the VP2 region from PCR-positive samples. These two primer sets covered the entire coding
regions of CAV [8]. The PCR amplification was carried
out in PCR buffer that contained 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 μM
of each dNTP, 10 pmol each primer, and 1.0 U Takara
LA Taq™ polymerase (TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd.,
Dalian, China) in a 25-μl total reaction volume. The reaction was carried out in an automated thermal cycler
(Gene Amp PCR System 9700, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Amplification of 1390 bp of the VP1
region was carried out with initial denaturation of 94°C

for 4 min, followed by 34 cycles of denaturation, annealing and extension at 94°C for 1 min, 60°C for 1 min and
72°C for 2 min, respectively, and the final extension was
carried out at 72°C for 15 min. Amplification of 713 bp
of the VP2 region was carried out with initial denaturation of 94°C for 4 min, followed by 34 cycles of denaturation, annealing, extension at 94°C for 1 min, 63°C for 1
min and 72°C for 1 min, respectively, and final extension
was carried out at 72°C for 5 min. The PCR products
were then analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis
and imaged with the EpiChem system (UVP Bioimaging
Systems). In all PCR reactions, a previously characterized
CAV isolate maintained in our laboratory was uses as a
positive control. The PCR mixture was used as a negative
control. The VP1 and VP2 regions were purified using an
agarose gel with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), and sequenced with ABI Prism, BigDye Terminator
(Shanghai, China) using PCR primers. For each samples,
DNA extraction and PCR was run at least twice.
DNA cloning and sequencing

In the case of sequencing failure, specific PCR products of
the VP1 and VP2 regions were subcloned into pGEM®-T
Easy vector (Promega, Madison, USA). The ligated products were transformed into Escherichia coli subcloning
efficiency DH5a competent cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA). Colonies that contained DNA inserts of the
correct size were picked and grown overnight in 3 ml
Luria-Bertani (LB) liquid medium containing ampicillin.
The mini-preparation of plasmid DNAs was performed
using the plasmid extraction Kit (AxyPrep™ Plasmid
Miniprep, Hangzhou, China), following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The plasmid DNAs were employed as a template for sequencing with ABI Prism, BigDye Terminator.
Analysis of sequence data

Sequences were analyzed using the Bioedit program [9].
Forward and reverse sequences were aligned with Clustal
W [10]. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses
were based on the VP1, VP2 and VP3 genes sequences,
using MEGA version 3.1 [11]. Phylogenic analysis of
nucleic acid and deduced amino acid sequences was done
with the neighbor-joining method, Kimura 2-parameter
model. The amino acid sequences were also analyzed with
the neighbor-joining method, with the Poisson correction.
Bootstrap values (1000 replications) were indicated on
each tree. Nucleotides were numbered according to Meehan et al. [8]. Relevant VP1, VP2 and VP3 sequences available on GenBank were used for comparison.

Results
Virus detection

Of the 460 spleen samples studied, specific PCR products (186 bp) of the VP2 region were detected in 47

(10.22%) adult birds (6-36 weeks old), with 6, 17 and 24
from Anhui, Hunan and Jiangsu provinces, respectively
(Figure 1A). In comparison, none of the samples collected from 1-7-day-old chickens was positive by PCR.
PCR amplification of different regions of CAV genome

PCR amplification of the VP1 region using primers
VP1F and VP1R yielded a specific product of 1390 bp,
and similarly, PCR amplification of the VP2 region
using primers VP2F and VP2R yielded specific product
of 713 bp (Figure 1B and 1C). The authenticity of PCR
amplification was confirmed by the expected size in
agarose gel cloning and sequencing. Twenty five CAV
genome sequences characterized in this study were submitted to GenBank with accession numbers
[HQ872023-HQ872047]. Identical sequences were submitted only once.
Sequence alignment and phylogenic analysis

Nucleotides of the 25 Chinese viral genomes were annotated, and a length of 1766 bp that contained almost the
entire CAV coding region except for a few amino acids
at the C terminus of VP1 was obtained.
The maximum Kimura distance between the new 25
Chinese VP1, VP2 and VP3 sequences was 4.92%
between JS-China 60 and JS-China 14, in comparison
with 5.17% between Australia EF683159 and USA
L14767 for the world maximum Kimura distance calculated from worldwide relevant VP1, VP2 and VP3
sequences (neighbor-joining method, Kimura 2-parameters model).
The Chinese viral sequences presented 8 nucleotide
mutations in the VP3 protein, which had not been
observed previously in strains from other parts of the

world (nt positions 37, 57, 66, 131, 134, 135, 141 and
145), of which, seven were found in more than one
sequence. There were 10 mutations (nt positions 9, 15,
19, 21, 54, 106, 107, 273, 316 and 474) in the VP 2 protein, of which, three were found in more than one
sequence. Finally, there were 60 mutations in the highly
variable VP1 protein, of which, 36 were found in more
than one sequence (nt positions 12, 21, 26, 30, 49, 73,
210, 219, 225, 231, 252, 288, 324, 423, 567, 600, 649,
661, 669, 681, 774, 786, 797, 867, 876, 882, 913, 924,
939, 943, 945, 1011, 1012, 1023, 1033 and 1044); numbered according to a previous study [12].
Phylogenetic analysis at the nucleotide level (1766 bp)
of the Chinese CAV genomes characterized in this
study, together with CAV strains from different countries, led to four distinct sequence groups (A, B C and
D), with significant high bootstrap values of 92, 99 and
100 separating them, respectively. Group A could be
further divided into subgroups A1, A2 and A 3 that
were separated from each other by a bootstrap value of
78 and 93. Group D could be further divided into subgroups D1 and D2 that were separated from each other
by bootstrap value of 88. The new Chinese CAV
sequences were located as four different clusters within
groups A and D (Figure 2).
Group A represented a major group of 39 isolates that
originated from Asia, the USA and Europe, in which,
five new CAV sequences from China (JS-China 22, JSChina 78, AN- 23, AN-China 36 and AN-China 34)
were located within subgroup A1, together with other
isolates from the USA, India and Bangladesh.
Four new Chinese sequences (HU-China 50, JS-China
4, JS-China 7 and JS-China 6) were clustered within
subgroup A2 that contained the prototypic CAV strain

CAE CUX1 from Germany, together with other isolates
that originated from India, Malaysia, Japan, Bangladesh,
UK, Netherlands and USA (Figure 2).
The majority of Chinese CAV genomes characterized
in this study (HU-China 13, JS-China 9, JS-China 14, JSChina 17, JS-China 70, JS-China 32, JS-China 83, JSChina 38 and JS-China 73) and three previous characterized Chinese isolates (AY846844 TBJ 40, AY 843527
and AF 475908) were clustered within subgroup A3
together with one isolate from Japan (Figure 2).
Only one isolate from Japan (Japan AB 046590) and
two from Australia (Australia AF227982 and Australia
EF683159) comprised group B and C, respectively.
Seven new Chinese sequences (JS-China 11, JS-China
84, JS-China 60, JS-China 66, HU-China 6, HU-China 8
and HU-China 10), together with one isolate from USA
comprised subgroup D1. Other isolates from India,
Malaysia, Japan and Australia comprised subgroup D2
(Figure 2).
Amino acid alignment and phylogenetic analysis

When the amino acids of the 25 Chinese sequences
were aligned, the maximum Kimura distance was
increased to 2.92% between JS-China 60 and HU-China
13, in comparison with 2.5% between JapanD31965 and
MalaysiaAF285882 SMS1 and USA 4903007 TR 20.
Analysis of the deduced 189 amino acids of VP3 protein revealed only two amino acid variations detected in
a single genome, which were specific to Chinese
sequences (aa 32 and 56). The deduced 216-amino-acid
sequence of VP2 protein revealed 8 variable amino acids
that were specific to the Chinese sequences detected in
more than one viral genome (positions 36, 160, 171,
178, 181, 203, 204 and 206), and a additional three substitutions detected in a single genome (aa 106, 152 and
204). In contrast, the deduced 431-amino-acid sequence
of VP1 protein revealed 14 variable amino acids that
were specific to the Chinese sequences detected in more
than one sequence (aa 13, 22, 45, 76, 92, 182, 294, 332,
370, 371, 379, 381, 412, 416 and 429), and an additional
16 substitutions that were detected in single genome
(positions 49, 65, 66, 67, 139, 140, 197, 219, 279, 282,
283, 288, 313, 380 and 416). The amino acid at position
394 was glutamine (Q) in all Chinese sequences under
the study; numbered according to a previous study [12]
(Figure 3).
The phylogenetic tree at the amino acid level did not
support the grouping and subgrouping of sequences as
established by nucleotide sequences. Instead only two
major groups each of which contains Chinese isolates
could be developed (Figure 4).
Five new Chinese CAV sequences (JS-China 78, ANChina 34, JS China-22, AN-China 23 and AN-China 36),
together with isolates from USA (USA L14767), India

(AY 583756 CAV-B and AY 583758 CAV-P) and Bangladesh (AF 395114) that clustered in group A at the
nucleotide level became closely related to group D at
the amino acid level. Similarly, two strains from Australia (Australia AF227982 and Australia EF683159) and
one isolate from Japan ( Japan D 31965) that belonged
to group C and B, respectively, at the nucleotide level
became closely related to group A at the amino acid
level (Figure 4).

Discussion
CAV is an economically important pathogen worldwide
due to its highly immunosuppressive effect. In China,
CAV was first reported in 1996 [6]. Later, the VP1 protein sequences that were amplified from isolates from
live bird market in Southeast China showed no clear
genotype clustering or correlation with geographic origin [7]. Therefore, the need was felt for further molecular characterization using long sequences of these
viruses to establish the variations among them, if any,
which would help to devise a suitable control strategy to
prevent losses in the poultry industry.
The present study is believed to be the first molecular
analysis of approximately full-length CAV genomes
from China. The study was based on the genetic diversity of the VP1, VP2 and VP3 of 25 new CAV genome
sequences.
Of the 460 spleen samples screened by PCR, CAV
genome was detected in 47 adult birds only (10.22%),
but it was not detected at all in young birds (1-7 days
old). This low prevalence as compared with the previous
42% seroprevalence [6] and the high nested PCR detection of 87% [7] could have been due to the difference in
the type of sample used, areas of study, and the sensitivity of detection methods conducted in each study [13].
After about 3 weeks of age, immunocompetent chickens
are resistant to disease, but they can acquire asymptomatic infections and transmit the virus horizontally
[3-14]. The adult birds tested in this study were probably subclinically infected. Thus, detection of CAV genome in adult birds alone indicates that horizontal
transmission plays a major role in CAV infection in
China, and that young birds are partially protected by
maternally derived antibodies [7].
At the nucleotide level of the 1766 bp from position
386 to 2151 [12], the new Chinese viral sequences
showed 4.92% variation among them, which revealed
that they were unique, because the maximum variation
among CAV isolates from other countries was 5.1% [15].
Phylogenetic analysis of CAV strains allowed easy
grouping of the sequences into four distinct groups (AD) and five subgroups (A1, A2, A3, D1 and D2) with
significantly high bootstrap values. Previous phylogenetic
analysis based on the full genome of only 13 CAV

isolates from different countries also categorized CAV
strains into four groups (A-D), but no subgroups were
reported [16]. In contrast, studies using only the VP1
sequences from different parts of the world have
demonstrated that CAV isolates could be grouped into
three major clusters (I, II, IIIa and IIIb). However, this
clustering system was not fulfilled later when 74 VP1
CAV sequences from China were included [7]. In the
present study, the amplified 1766 bp from the CAV genome provided a clear genotype clustering of CAV isolates into four major groups. However, no correlation
with the geographic origin of the CAV isolates was
obtained for groups A and D despite the use of satisfactory sequences data. In contrast, groups B and C comprised only isolates that originated from Japan and
Australia. Thus, for better understanding of the

molecular epidemiology of CAV isolates, more sequence
data are required globally.
The new Chinese CAV sequences were located within
subgroups A1, A2 A3 or D1. This indicates that four
genetically different CAV clusters are circulating in
China. The fact that none of these four clusters was
solely established by Chinese isolates reveals that CAV
isolates from China might have originated from different
parts of the world, namely Europe, Australia, Asia and
USA.
The nucleotide mutations observed in the VP3 and
VP2 regions of the new Chinese sequences resulted in 6
amino acid variations in the C-terminal quarter of the
VP2 protein only. This is in accordance with other studies that have indicated that the N-terminal half of VP3
and the N-terminal three quarters of VP2 are well

indicated on the branches (as percentages). Sequences from the present study (colored closed symbols) are named as follows PP-China where
PP is the area of origin. Sequences from GenBank were given the country name followed by accession number. The two major groups were
identified as I and II.

conserved, and might sustain essential functions of these
proteins [8-17].
Analysis of 431 amino acids of the VP1 region indicated 30 amino acid variations that were specific to the
Chinese viral genomes. Only two of these variations
observed in one sequence were in the highly variable
region (aa 139-151). In contrast, no mutations have
been reported previously in the VP1 protein of Chinese
isolates [7].
The amino acid at position 394 in VP1 was reported
to be a major genetic determinant of virulence. CAV
isolates are highly pathogenic if its glutamine (Q) or less
pathogenic if its histidine (H) [8-18]. All Chinese CAV
genomes characterized in this study had glutamine (Q)
at this position, which indicated that all were highly
pathogenic. Mutations associated with attenuation and
weaker reactivity with monoclonal antibody 2A9 (complete I75, T89, L125, L141, E144 or H394) [9] were
absent in the Chinese sequences. This observation is in
agreement with previous studies on the VP1 of Chinese
isolates [7].
The phylogenetic analysis of sequences at the amino
acid level did not support the grouping based on the
nucleotide sequences. Several studies have shown that
groupings of CAV isolates based on nucleotide and
amino acid sequences differ as a result of silent mutations, and consequently, CAV isolates are almost identical at the amino acid level despite differences at the
nucleotide level [7,16,19].

Conclusions
This is the first report on the characterization of 25 full
genomes of CAV from China. The prevalence of CAV
in the area of study was found to be lower than that
reported previously in commercial poultry farms from
other parts of China. CAV isolates worldwide were clustered into four major groups. Four different, highly
pathogenic genotypes of CAV were found to be currently evolving in China. The study provides a basis for
future epidemiological research on CAV, although more
sequences data are needed globally.
