Spatial structure and nest demography reveal the
influence of competition, parasitism and habitat
quality on slavemaking ants and their hosts
Inon Scharf1,2*, Birgit Fischer-Blass1 and Susanne Foitzik1,2

Abstract
Background: Natural communities are structured by intra-guild competition, predation or parasitism and the
abiotic environment. We studied the relative importance of these factors in two host-social parasite ecosystems in
three ant communities in Europe (Bavaria) and North America (New York, West Virginia). We tested how these
factors affect colony demography, life-history and the spatial pattern of colonies, using a large sample size of more
than 1000 colonies. The strength of competition was measured by the distance to the nearest competitor. Distance
to the closest social parasite colony was used as a measure of parasitism risk. Nest sites (i.e., sticks or acorns) are
limited in these forest ecosystems and we therefore included nest site quality as an abiotic factor in the analysis. In
contrast to previous studies based on local densities, we focus here on the positioning and spatial patterns and we
use models to compare our predictions to random expectations.
Results: Colony demography was universally affected by the size of the nest site with larger and more productive
colonies residing in larger nest sites of higher quality. Distance to the nearest competitor negatively influenced
host demography and brood production in the Bavarian community, pointing to an important role of competition,
while social parasitism was less influential in this community. The New York community was characterized by the
highest habitat variability, and productive colonies were clustered in sites of higher quality. Colonies were clumped
on finer spatial scales, when we considered only the nearest neighbors, but more regularly distributed on coarser
scales. The analysis of spatial positioning within plots often produced different results compared to those based on
colony densities. For example, while host and slavemaker densities are often positively correlated, slavemakers do
not nest closer to potential host colonies than expected by random.
Conclusions: The three communities are differently affected by biotic and abiotic factors. Some of the differences
can be attributed to habitat differences and some to differences between the two slavemaking-host ecosystems.
The strong effect of competition in the Bavarian community points to the scarcity of resources in this uniform
habitat compared to the other more diverse sites. The decrease in colony aggregation with scale indicates finescale resource hotspots: colonies are locally aggregated in small groups. Our study demonstrates that species
relationships vary across scales and spatial patterns can provide important insights into species interactions. These
results could not have been obtained with analyses based on local densities alone. Previous studies focused on
social parasitism and its effect on host colonies. The broader approach taken here, considering several possible
factors affecting colony demography and not testing each one in isolation, shows that competition and
environmental variability can have a similar strong impact on demography and life-history of hosts. We conclude
that the effects of parasites or predators should be studied in parallel to other ecological influences.

Background
Enemy-victim interactions are not only affected by local
densities in a certain habitat, but also by the movement of
individuals and their location [e.g. [1-3]]. Animals clearly
interact more often with neighbors than with more distant
individuals. Nevertheless, many predator-prey models are
spatially-implicit [sensu [4]]. The analysis of positioning or
spatial pattern can lead to a better understanding of species interactions. Studies based on species densities alone
might miss important local interactions, as if they analyze
these interactions on a too coarse scale [5]. Predators and
parasites reduce the fitness of their victims and they affect
many behavioral and life-history traits [e.g. [6,7]]. For
example, prey/host individuals avoid risky habitats,
decrease foraging in general, reach smaller body size or
require a longer development time [8]. Such behavioral
and life-history responses are costly.
Behavioral and life-history changes are context-dependent and operate in parallel with other factors, such as
competition and resource availability. For instance, predation risk is often ignored if the prey risks starvation
[e.g. [9]]. Competition, ever present in nature, can force
individuals to increase foraging effort [e.g., by facing
interference from other competitors or depletion of food
resources [10]]. Animals, therefore, face conflicting
demands. For example, coping with predation might
require a change in habitat usage, which is different from
its usage under high parasitism risk [11]. The spatial pattern can also be affected in opposite ways. Competition
for space or food often results in a regular spatial pattern,
as individuals maximize the distance to other competitors. Predation risk, however, frequently leads to a
clumped spatial distribution of prey, to dilute the risk
[12,13]. Therefore, studies combining predation/parasitism with other important biotic and abiotic factors can
better and more reliably estimate the relative importance
of predation/parasitism for prey populations.
We study here the effect of parasitism risk combined
with competition and an abiotic limiting factor on host
ant colonies in two ecosystems of slavemaking-host ants.
Slavemaking ants are obligate social parasites that depend
on enslaved host workers recruited during recurrent
slave-raids from host nests [14-16]. Slavemaking ant
workers are incapable of foraging and taking care of their
brood. They specialize on invading host nests and stealing their brood, killing host workers and occasionally the
queens. Stolen host brood is raised in the slavemaker
nest, and emerging host workers serve as slaves [14-16].
Removing/adding social parasites induce changes in host
life-history and densities, which are species and population-specific [17,18]. Two general responses were evident
in plots populated by slavemaking ants. In one population, host colonies under parasite pressure were more

Page 2 of 13

related, contained fewer queens and workers and had a
lower brood production. In another population, host densities were reduced with a milder impact on social structure and life-history [18]. Slavemaking ants fit the
definition of ‘micro-predators’. They attack more than
one host colony, unlike typical parasites (which attack
one host), and exploited host individuals are not necessarily killed following attacks, unlike typical predators
(which kill their prey) [19]. Slavemaking ants resemble in
some aspects parasites, and in others predators (e.g., raiding dynamic). Comparisons to parasite-host/predatorprey interactions are imperfect, but based on the rich
literature of both interactions, they allow drawing testable predictions.
The life-history responses of host ants to slavemaking
ants emerged from comparisons between plots rich and
poor with slavemaking ants, and from experimental
manipulations during which slavemaker nests were
removed/added. Yet, spatial pattern were not reported
and within-plot differences among colonies are not
accounted for [17,18,20,21]. We define “fine scale” as
referring to within-plot spatial heterogeneity (i.e., colonies interact only with neighbors), and “coarse scale” as
referring only to colony densities within the plots (i.e.,
neighbors are not expected to interact more frequently).
Previous studies used only “coarse scale” (as defined
here) in their analysis, and also did not inspect the relative importance of different explanatory variables [e.g.
[17,18,20,21]]. Slavemaking ants can strongly influence
their hosts, but the relative importance of this selective
force would only be revealed when placed in a larger
context, that is when statistical analyses include additional explanatory variables.
We use three large datasets of host and slavemaking ant
colonies in three communities - New York and West Virginia (hereafter NY and WV), USA, and Bavaria, Germany which include detailed data on colony demography (e.g.,
number of workers and social structure) and the size of the
nest site. We study how local competition, parasitism risk
and limitation for nest sites affect spatial pattern, colony
demography and brood production of host colonies. We
also test for effects of host density and spatial pattern on
the slavemaker ants’ demography. We use the same analytical tools to compare these communities (composed of
different species) in order to reveal the relative importance
of different factors in shaping these species interactions.
While habitats and ant communities differ to a certain
extent, the species interactions are comparable (see Methods for a detailed description). Comparing related systems
is important for generalization and understanding how natural selection leads to similar solutions when the environment is similar [e.g., a comparison between the foraging
behavior of desert rodents in two continents [22]].

We have two main objectives: (1) comparing the relative
importance of different selective factors in three communities of ants; (2) better understanding the importance of
scale when studying species interactions. Our working
hypothesis is that interactions are space-dependent - colonies interact more frequently with immediate neighbors.
We predict therefore that host colonies residing close to a
slave-making colony or in a locally denser microhabitat
should suffer from parasitism or competition more than
host colonies located further away. This difference should
be reflected in life-history traits (a negative correlation
between competition or parasitism intensity and colony
size, brood production and per-capita productivity). Alternatively, if there is strong local variation in resource availability, colonies in denser high-quality areas could be
more successful than colonies in poorer sites of low density. In this case, a negative correlation between distance
to the nearest neighbor and life-history traits could be
found. Similar to other systems, we expect the colony spatial pattern to be regular on a fine scale and clumped on a
coarser scale [23,24]. This shift results from different limiting factors on different scales (finer scales - competition;
coarser scales - environmental heterogeneity). We also
expect that as colony densities increase, the spatial pattern
should be more regular, as colonies try maximizing the
distance to the nearest competitor.
We hypothesize that the relative influence of parasitism
risk, competition and nest site limitation would be system-dependent. We predict that nest site limitation
would be a universal factor, more dominant than other
factors. High quality nest sites are a limiting resource in
such ecosystems, and a positive correlation between colony size, brood production and nest site size should be
evident, due to competition for nest sites. Competition
should be important in Bavaria, which is already known
as a poor relatively sparsely-populated habitat. Parasite
pressure should be higher in WV and NY, and especially
in the latter, as slavemaking ants in NY inflict larger
damage to host colonies compared to other habitats [18].
Slavemaking nests having closer host neighbors should
reside in areas with a higher host density, and thus possess larger more productive colonies. Alternatively, virulent slavemaking ants may have only few host neighbors,
because they already destroyed all nests nearby.

Methods
Study ecosystems and sites

We used a dataset of host and slavemaker ant locations
and demography in NY (Edmund Nils Huyck preserve; 42°
32’N, 74°9’W; 500 m a.s.l.) and WV (Watoga state park;
38°6’N, 80°8’W; 850 m a.s.l.) [[18], unpublished data]. The
main host ant species, Temnothorax longispinosus, is parasitized by the slavemaking ant Protomognathus americanus and constituted between ~85% (NY) and ~95%

Page 3 of 13

(WV) of all collected ant nests. Other host species collected were T. curvispinosus in WV and T. ambiguus in
NY, and colonies of those species were removed from
later analysis. The datasets include 18 and 21 sampled
plots in NY and WV of 25 m2 each, in which all colonies
were collected and censused (May 2001). We have data on
each colony location, number of queens, workers and larvae. T. longispinosus is a facultatively polydomous species
(i.e., colonies may occupy more than a single nest) [25].
The identification of colony boundaries requires behavioral and genetic analyses, and is not trivial [26]. For our
large sample size, this work-intensive procedure is not feasible. We thus follow earlier studies on Temnothorax ants,
suggesting that selection operates on the nest level in this
species [27,28]. Since colonies were collected before summer, there was still no production of sexuals, but only larvae. Colony densities per m2 in the field were higher in
NY 0.904 ± 0.362 (mean ± 1 S.D.) than in WV (0.604 ±
0.377; Mann Whitney U test: U = 227.0, P = 0.013, N =
18,21). In further analysis (spatial pattern and demography) we refer to the P. americanus as the slavemaker and
T. longispinosus as the host. Total number of host and slavemaker colonies was 407 and 33 (NY) and 317 and 35
(WV).
In addition, we used a dataset of ant locations and
demography from a community in Bavaria, Germany
(~8 km east of Abensberg; 48°49’N, 11°58’E; 400 m a.s.
l.) [[29], unpublished data]. The European ecosystem is
slightly more complex, involving two host species at
about the same rate, the larger Leptothorax acervorum
and the smaller Leptothorax muscorum, parasitized by
the slavemaker Harpagoxenus sublaevis. A third species
in that community, Temnothorax crassispinus, does not
serve as a host for the slavemaking ant, but is a potential competitor for the two host species. We therefore
include it in the spatial pattern, but do not analyze its
demography. The dataset includes 20 plots of 100 m2
each, in which all colonies were collected and censused
in July-August 2001. We possess information on colony
location, number of queens, workers, production of sexuals, pupae and larvae. Colony densities in the field are
0.158 ± 0.056 (mean ± 1 S.D.) and are only 18-30% of
the nest densities in the North American ecosystem.
Total number of host (of the two species) and slavemaker colonies was 315 and 31 (we had exact coordinates in the collection site of only 28).
The three collection areas belong to larger forests. The
collection sites in the USA are a part of nature preserves, undisturbed at least since ~1930 (Huyck preserve
website: http://www.huyckpreserve.org/index.htm;
Watoga park website: http://www.pocahontascountywv.
com/watoga_state_park.aspx). Both are characterized by
a diversity of trees, dominated by different oak species
(Quercus spp.) and hickory (Carya spp.), including also

Scharf et al. BMC Ecology 2011, 11:9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/11/9

maple trees (Acer spp.) (Figure 1). The forest near
Abensberg, Bavaria, is a monoculture of a single pine
tree, Pinus sylvestris (Figure 1). The North American
ant species nest in acorns, nuts or small wood sticks in
the leaf litter layer of deciduous forests [20], while the
European ants inhabit pine forests and invariably nest in
pine sticks and logs on the forest floor. We documented
in all datasets the size of the nest site. As a measure of
nest site size, we refer to the diameter of the organic
structure (e.g., stick, acorn, etc.) in which the colony
resides. For long sticks we measured the diameter at the
cavity of the colony.
The three studied ecosystems and ant species are ecologically similar, but also show several dissimilarities. All
hosts and social parasites are small cavity-dwelling ants
of temperate forests, residing in woody structures [e.g.
[25,30-32]]; colonies relocate frequently due to the
decomposition of their ephemeral nest sites [31]; they
are phylogenetically related [33]; the ecological factors
shaping the host ants’ natural history are similar [e.g.,

Page 4 of 13

competition, risk of parasitism by slavemakers, and
environmental effects [18,25,30,34]]; and their colony
size, social structure and foraging behavior are alike [e.g.
[35-37]]. The main dissimilarities are the higher complexity of one ecosystem in which the slavemaking ant
parasitizes two (and not one) host species at similar
rates, resulting in different selective pressures; the forest
tree species composition; and the polydomous nature of
one host species (i.e., a colony occupying more than one
nest) compared to all other monodomous species.
Statistical analysis
1. What is the spatial pattern of host colonies?

We applied all statistical analyses separately to the three
communities, unless else mentioned. We estimated the
spatial pattern by designing a null model, similar to previous studies [23]. Null models keep some of the data
elements fixed while randomizing the rest, creating a
pattern that is expected in the absence of any driving
mechanism [38]. We randomly redistributed for each

species diversity than the Bavarian monoculture pine forest.

plot the same number of colonies originally residing in
the plot 1000 times and estimated the expected distances of each colony to the 1 st -6th nearest neighbor.
We then divided the real mean distances to the k th
nearest neighbor of all colonies in a plot by the grand
mean of 1000 expected mean distances to the kth nearest neighbor, derived from random distribution. We
received six values for each plot in each habitat, representing the 1st -6th nearest neighbor indices (hereafter
NNI). Values larger and smaller than one indicate regular and clumped spatial patterns, respectively. We used
the percentile bootstrap [39] on all plots within each
community to estimate the 95% confidence limit intervals for the NNIs. See Additional File 1 for flow charts
of all null models. In order to test for an effect of host
and slavemaker densities within plots on the spatial pattern, we used linear regressions, with host or slavemaker
densities and NNIs as explanatory and dependent variables respectively. Simulations and statistical analyses
were performed in MATLAB v.6.5 (Mathworks, Natick,
USA) and SYSTAT v.11 (SYSTAT Software, San Jose,
USA).
2. Are the slavemaking colonies correlated in space with
host ant colonies?

We refer to this question on coarser (among plots, no
reference to space) and finer (within plots, relating to
distances to nearest neighbors) scales. We first correlated the slavemaker and host colony abundance in each
plot, for each community separately, using three linear
regressions (i.e., host densities explaining slavemaker
densities). We used a similar null model to analyze if
the slavemaking colonies are closer to host colonies
than expected (i.e., analysis on a finer scale). We randomized the location of each slavemaking colony for 1000
times and recalculated the distance to its nearest host
colony within each plot. We calculated 95% limit intervals for the obtained distribution of distances. When the
true distance to the nearest host falls within these limits,
the slavemaker is neither closer to nor more distant
from the hosts than randomly expected. We repeat it
for the 2nd -6th nearest neighbors, to test for a similar
relationship with more distant neighbor.
3. Are both host species positively auto-correlated in space?

This question was relevant only to the Bavarian dataset
including two potential host species, and we analyzed
the data on coarser and finer scales. We correlated the
densities of the two host species in all plots. Species
abundance can be either positively correlated pointing
to a favorable microhabitat, or negatively correlated,
owing to inter-specific competition. Species auto-correlation on a finer scale was tested by a similar null
model. We calculated in each plot for each species the
proportion of colonies having nearest neighbors of the
same species. Next, we reshuffled the species types (but

Page 5 of 13

not locations) for 1000 times and recalculated the proportion of colonies having nearest neighbor of the same
species. We then subtracted the observed proportions
for each plot from the mean proportion expected by
chance, calculated by averaging the proportions in 1000
replications. We created 95% confidence limit intervals
using the percentile bootstrap. If zero is included in the
obtained distribution, species are not more correlated
than randomly expected.
4. Which factors affect host and slavemaker colony
demography?

We present here a fine-scale analysis, i.e., a within-plot
analysis referring to nearest neighbors and slavemaking
colonies in contrast to simply comparing colony densities. We used general linear models (GLMs) to test for
the effects of distance to nearest host competitor colony
(nearest neighbor distance: NND) as a proxy of competition, distance to nearest slavemaking colony (nearest slavemaker distance: NSMD) as a proxy of parasitism risk,
nest site size (NS) and all possible interactions on the
number of workers, queens, immature stages (only larvae
in NY and WV), males and new queen production (only
in the Bavarian dataset), and per-capita productivity
(immature stages and sexuals/number of workers). We
performed the analyses separately for the three communities, and used plot as an additional explanatory variable.
In NY and WV communities there was only one host
species, while in Bavaria we analyzed both host species
and use also species as an explanatory variable. We also
documented if the nearest neighbor is the same host species or another species (NNSp). To disentangle between
intra-specific and inter-specific competition we included
it in the analysis. We tested for all possible interactions
of species with other explanatory variables. NNSp interactions included only NNSp × NND. The competitor
unparasitized species T. crassispinus was not included.
We referred only to parasitized plots, because NSMD
was always part of the analysis. All variables were log
transformed, since they were not normally distributed.
We used a model selection procedure to decide which
interactions should be included in each model, including
the Akaike information criterion corrected for small
sample size (hereafter, AICc) [40]. We started each time
with a saturated model and gradually removed the least
significant interaction. We recorded the number of parameters (main effects, interactions, constant and error
term) and the RSS (residual sum of squares) for the calculation of the AICc. We stopped the removal process
when the model included only one explanatory variable.
The best model was chosen according to the minimal
AICc values [40]. The best model may include not significant factors or remove significant factors, depending
on the RSS, sample size and number of parameters in
the model.

Scharf et al. BMC Ecology 2011, 11:9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/11/9

We were interested whether the same results were evident when using a coarser spatial scale - plot densities
instead of NNDs, as another proxy of competition. For
that purpose we tested using a GLM the effect of plot
density while accounting for nest site size and plot (adding nest size and plot number as explanatory variables)
on number of workers and total production in the
Bavarian dataset. We used only this dataset, because the
strongest effect of competition was evident there on a
fine scale.
Slavemaker demography was analyzed using model
selection. Size of the nest site, distance to nearest host
and the two-way interaction were treated as explanatory
variables. Slavemaker workers and number of slaves were
referred to as the dependent variables. We removed the
interaction and each of the two main effects and chose
the best model according to AICc. Due to the small sample size of slavemaker colonies, we pooled over plots.
5. Do ant communities differ in habitat heterogeneity?

The previous analyses can provide indications on how
variable resources are distributed in space in the different habitats. For example, if ant colonies are more productive in dense sites, we would conclude that
competition is less important and resource availability
varies in space. To investigate habitat heterogeneity in
more detail, we calculated for each community the coefficient of variation (CV) of the abiotic and biotic community characteristics within each plot (CV of worker
number, total production and size of the nest site).
These values represent heterogeneity within plots. We
used three one-way ANOVA with community (Bavaria,
NY and WV) as the explanatory variable and each of
the above as dependent variables.

2. Are the slavemaking colonies correlated in space with
host ant colonies?

On a coarser scale, we tested for a correlation between
host and slavemaker densities in each plot. We could
not find a significant association between host and slavemaker density either in NY (F1,16 = 0.52, P = 0.48, R2
< 0.001) or Bavaria (F1,18 = 0.65, P = 0.43, R2 < 0.001),
but a positive correlation was found in WV (F 1,19 =
14.79, P = 0.001, R2 = 0.408). On a finer scale, the null
model suggested that slavemaker colonies are usually
not closer than expected to host colonies, independent
of the NNI used (1st to 6th). In Bavaria 23-25 of 28 slavemaker colonies (82.1-89.3%) were inside the randomly
expected range of distances from host colonies for all 1st
to 6th nearest neighbor hosts. Similar proportions could
be shown in NY (84.9-90.9%, 28-30/33) and WV (90.994.3%, 30-33/35).
3. Are both host species positively auto-correlated in
space?

This question was relevant only to the Bavarian dataset.
On a coarser scale, we tested for an association between
the two species abundances in every plot using a Pearson correlation. Host densities were significantly and
negatively correlated (Bartlett c2 statistic = 5.64, df = 1,
P = 0.018). However, on a finer scale and according to
the null model, both species were not more auto-correlated than expected (confidence limit intervals of
[-0.131,0.007] and [-0.137,0.004] for L. acervorum and
L. muscorum, respectively). This suggests that the probability for each host species to have a nearest neighbor
of the same or other species is similar, given the abundance of both species within each plot. See Additional
File 3 for further analysis of the Bavarian community.

Results
1. What is the spatial pattern of host colonies?

Host colonies were slightly clumped on a finer scale
when considering the immediate neighbors (the 1st-4th
nearest neighbors; Figure 2a). This trend was the
strongest in WV and the weakest in Bavaria, where the
spatial pattern was random (the value of 1 falls within
the 95% confidence limit intervals). On a coarser scale
colonies became over-dispersed in all communities
(the 5 th -6 th nearest neighbors; Figure 2a). Linear
regressions found no significant correlations between
either host or slavemaker densities and nearest neighbor indices either in Bavaria or WV (all P > 0.05).
However, negative correlations were evident in NY for
most NNIs: colonies aggregate more with increasing
density of both hosts and slavemakers (see Additional
File 2 for the statistical significance). The interaction
term, host × slavemaker densities, was not significant
(all P > 0.05).

4. Which factors affect host and slavemaker colony
demography?

The models selected according to AICc are presented in
Table 1. In several cases the difference between the best
and second best models was very small (difference in
AICc values < 0.7; Table 1). The three-way interactions,
host species (in the Bavarian community) as well as the
species identity of the nearest neighbor (NNSp) or its
interaction with the distance to the nearest neighbor
(NNSp × NND) were never included in the best model
and are therefore absent from Table 1. In general, the
Bavarian community was negatively affected by density
or intra-guild competition. Worker number, total production and per-capita productivity increase with distance to the nearest neighbor (Figure 3a). In the NY
community there was a negative correlation of per-capita
productivity with NND and NSMD: the per-capita productivity of host colonies is higher in close vicinity to

conspecific and slavemaker colonies (Figure 3b). Finally,
WV community was affected mostly by size of the nest
site, which had an effect on the two other communities
as well (Figure 3c). In the Bavarian community, number
of workers and total production were not affected by plot
density in contrast to the finer-scale analysis presented in
Table 1 (number of workers: F1,276 = 0.78, P = 0.38; total
production: F1,286 = 0.14, P = 0.71).
Slavemaker colonies were affected by the size of their
nest site (Figure 3d) with little effect of distance to nearest host. The Bavarian slavemaker population was only
affected by the size of the nest site (best model included
only nest site size: Workers: F1,25 = 10.72, P = 0.003, R2 =
0.272; Slaves: F1,25 = 9.59, P = 0.005, R2 = 0.248). The NY
population was influenced by none of the explanatory
variables: no model explained well the dependent variable
(Workers: F1,30 = 2.26 P = 0.14, R2 = 0.039; Slaves: F1,31 =
1.48, P = 0.23, R2 = 0.015). WV slavemaker population

was affected by the distance to nearest host (Workers:
F 1,33 = 4.61, P = 0.039, R 2 = 0.096) and nest site size
(Slaves: F1,31 = 3.61, P = 0.067, R 2 = 0.075). Significant
correlations were always positive (Figure 3d).
5. Do ant communities differ in habitat heterogeneity?

Overall, NY showed a higher heterogeneity within plots
compared to the two other communities, and especially
WV (Figure 4). CV of worker number within plots differed among communities (F2,54 = 3.78, P = 0.029; LSD
post-hoc test: Bavaria and NY > WV), which was higher
in Bavaria and NY. CV of total production differed as
well among communities and was the highest in NY,
followed by Bavaria and WV (F 2,54 = 4.80, P = 0.012;
LSD post-hoc test: NY > WV). CV of the size of the
nest site showed a similar pattern to the CV of total
production (F2,54 = 6.61, P = 0.003; LSD post-hoc test:
Bavaria and NY > WV).

Discussion
We used three datasets to investigate different aspects of
competition in ants (distance to the nearest neighbor,
spatial pattern and size of the nest site), relationships of
host ants with their slavemaking parasites (distance to
the nearest slavemaker) and an abiotic limited resource
(nest sites). This combination represents selective forces
which affect demography and life-history differently in
each habitat. Competition was apparent in Bavaria,
while habitat heterogeneity dominated in New York.
Suitable nest sites were the only universal limiting factor
in these ecosystems. Analysis on finer scale (relating to
intra-plot spatial positioning of colonies and to the nearest neighbors) and coarser scales (referring only to plot
densities) often provided different results (Table 2). Previous studies focused on social parasitism and its effect

on host colonies [e.g. [17,18,29]]. We use a broader
approach, referring in parallel to competition and abiotic
factors. Such factors have a similar strong impact on
demography and life-history of hosts.
Host and slavemaking colonies move for several times
during the season due to the decomposition of their nest
sites [e.g. [25,31]]. Nevertheless, using the distances to the
nearest competitor or slavemaking colony is a suitable
proxy of competition or parasitism risk. Available nest
sites dictate the colonies’ locations, but nest sites are probably clustered in specific locations in the experimental
plots. Therefore, even after relocating, colonies remain
close to their previous location. There is no data on relocation distances in these species, but only on proportion
of relocating colonies throughout the season [21].
The maximal distance in a related species is 0.5 m

(T. nylanderi; S. Foitzik, personal observations). Therefore
and owing to the inefficient recruitment of the ants, the
relocation distances are probably short, so competition,
parasitism risk and the spatial pattern should not change
much following relocations. A more thorough experiment
following individual colonies would be helpful. However, it
is impossible to obtain data on the colony locations without destroying their nests and initiating emergency
relocations.
Interactions on fine vs. coarse scales

Competitive and parasitic interactions depend on the
scale of measurement. On a finer scale, slavemaking
colonies are not closer to their host colonies than randomly expected, a pattern found to be valid on a coarser
scale [WV in the current study; NY in a previous study
[20]]. The maximal distance of slave-raids in natural
populations is unclear, but polydomous nest parts of a
single parasite colony were found between 0.26 and 5.56
m apart [41,42]. Specifically in this case a too fine scale
may be of less importance, because slavemakers can
reach all parts of the study plots. Slave-raids could also
lead to a negative spatial correlation between host and
slavemaker colonies. This was also not the case. Even if
slavemakers clear-out their immediate surroundings
from host colonies, these empty nest sites can be repopulated fast by new colonies [41] owing to strong
competition for suitable nest sites [30].
In Bavaria, competition had a strong effect on various
life-history traits on a finer scale, and host species did
not show a spatial positive correlation. In comparison,
no evidence for competition was evident on a coarse
scale, but densities of host species were negatively correlated. The spatial pattern differed among scales as well
in all communities. Spatial correlations on a finer scale
were perhaps weaker because ant colonies sometimes
relocate their nests due to the decomposition of the
nest site [e.g. [30,31]]. These differences stress that
more than one scale should be used for analysis and
that the proper spatial scale for each question should be
carefully determined and justified.

The spatial pattern of host ants

The spatial pattern in all communities is relatively
clumped on a finer scale relating to the immediate
neighbors, but regular on a coarser scale, referring to
more distant neighbors. The small clusters observed
suggest that there are several ‘hotspots’ within plots,
each can sustain several colonies. Such ‘hotspots’ can
result from clumped spatial pattern of available nest
sites, polydomy or satellite nests, which may induce
patchiness in ant communities [43]. On a larger scale,
other factors are probably more relevant for spatial patterns, such as the habitat structure (e.g., locations of
trees). Studies of ant spatial pattern usually found a regular spatial pattern of colonies [44,45]. This was not the
case in this study, possibly because the studied ants rely
on specific nest sites, so that part of their spatial pattern
could be explained by the spatial pattern of these nest
sites on the forest floor.
Aggregation was mostly evident in NY and WV. The
spatial patterns in NY on all scales (1st-6th NNI) became
more clumped as slavemaker densities increased, supporting the concept of aggregating as an anti-predator
response. In a previous experiment, the NY host colonies responded to the presence of slavemaker by
changes in life-history and not by reduced density, as
was the case in WV [18]. Changes in spatial pattern
may be another strategy to cope with social parasite presence, in addition to modifications in life-history. Such
responses may enhance host colony survival (slavemaking ants reduce survival of hosts, mainly in WV). In
other words, host colonies in NY are possibly more flexible in responding to the slavemaker by changing both
some life-history traits and spatial pattern. However, the
spatial pattern was more clumped with an increase in
host densities as well, making it difficult to differentiate
between a causative or a correlative relationship
between slavemaker densities and the spatial pattern.
When competition is strong, the spatial pattern is
expected to be regular, as animals aim at maximizing
distances to nearest-neighbors [13,24,45]. In accord, the
Bavarian community showed the most regular spatial

Scharf et al. BMC Ecology 2011, 11:9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/11/9

pattern, on all k NNI used (Figure 2a). This fits well the
negative general impact of competition found in this
community.
Comparison of the dominant selective factors in each
community

The positive correlation between the size of the nest site
and different life-history traits was the most dominant
factor in all communities for both hosts and slavemakers. Previous studies have demonstrated a positive
correlation between the size of the nest site and the
number of queens or workers in cavity-dwelling ants
[25,30] and other ant species [e.g. [46]]. Nest sites also
affect the per-capita productivity. Per-capita productivity
may be influenced either directly or indirectly, since
more populous colonies reside in larger nests, and such
colonies may be more productive per worker. The latter
is not the case as the number of workers is either negatively or not correlated with per-capita productivity (a
negative correlation in WV: F1,305 = 4.34, P = 0.038, R2
= 0.011; no correlation in Bavaria: F 1,302 = 1.45, P =
0.23, R2 = 0.001; not relevant for NY, because the size
of the nest site was not correlated there with per-capita
productivity). This finding indicates that residing in high
quality nest sites per se raises colony per-capita productivity. Nest sites may restrict colony size, or larger colonies may more successfully compete for larger better
nests. When potential nest sites are artificially augmented they are rapidly populated changing colony densities,
sex ratios and sexual production [34]. Ants in crowded
nests can have higher metabolic rates with negative
effects on per-capita productivity and fitness [47]. We
support this observation, by showing a positive correlation between nest site size and different measures of
colony size and fitness.
The NY community was affected by habitat heterogeneity. Colonies were clustered in high-quality habitats as
indicated by the negative correlations between percapita productivity and distance to the nearest competitor. Heterogeneity was not measured directly, but the
higher variance within plots in NY in colony size, nest
size and total production point in this direction (Figure
4). It also fits to on-going research demonstrating that
NY colonies in denser areas are more productive (Modlmeier and Foitzik, in review). The WV community was
influenced only by the size of the nest site, with no significant effect of competition or parasitism risk. These
findings support a previous comparative study, showing
a stronger demographic effect of slavemaker colonies on
hosts in NY than in WV [18]. Some microhabitats inside
the plots in NY were probably favorable for ants, resulting in dense clusters, possibly related to the occurrence
of suitable nest sites which are not too degraded. Per-

Page 11 of 13

capita productivity decreased as moving out of these
clusters.
In Bavaria, as ant colonies are closer, they are smaller,
produce less brood and have lower per-capita productivity, all demonstrating the negative effects of competition.
In this case, the finer scale analysis with a reference to
nearest-neighbor distances produced stronger results.
Ryti and Case [45] showed the same positive correlation
between distance to nearest-neighbor and colony size in
species which are usually over-dispersed. Other studies
found first a positive correlation between distance to
nearest neighbor and alate production but later on failed
to find a similar correlation in the same ecosystem
(compare [48] with [49]). It is suggested that local high
densities may induce competition only when resources
are limited. We suggest the same: the Bavarian community was not as dense as the American ones, but competition there was more evident, probably owing to
resource limitation. We could not detect any difference
between intra- and inter-specific competition types in
Bavaria, as the identity of nearest neighbor had no effect
on any of the colony life-history variables.
The Bavarian community was sampled later in the
season than the American ones. This difference may
have resulted in a weaker footprint of parasitism risk in
the USA, because slave-raids occur usually later in the
season. The expectation, therefore, is for a stronger
parasitism risk in Bavaria, since slave-raids were ongoing at sampling time. We actually found the reverse.
In addition, similar to predation risk, parasitism risk can
result in direct effects (colonies are invaded and robbed)
and indirect ones (colonies change life-history traits to
better cope with that risk). The latter should not be
affected by the different sampling time. Other basic differences among habitats and ecosystems probably have
consequences for the results achieved. For example, the
Bavarian species are monodomous while the American
ones are polydomous. It is difficult to guess how competition, parasitism risk and limitation of nest sites will
affect polydomy and vice versa. We nevertheless suggest
that polydomy may increase if parasitism risk or competition are strong, as a way to spread the risk (similar to
bet-hedging), and if large nest sites are rare.
The slavemaker demography was affected by the size
of their nest site. We could not show other influential
factors possibly since our sample size is much lower for
the slavemakers compared to host colonies. Nevertheless, it also suggests that slavemaker colonies are less
spatially dependent than host colonies. Predators in general have a larger habitat range and they interact with
space on a larger scale than their prey [5]. Only in WV
there was an effect of the distance to the nearest host
on slavemaker colonies. It fits the strong effects

Scharf et al. BMC Ecology 2011, 11:9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/11/9

slavemakers have on host colony abundance in this
community [18]. In other words, since slavemaker ants
decrease the abundance of host colonies, it is logical to
assume that slavemaker colonies with closer neighbors
either exploit their environment less efficiently or are
perhaps just colonies in their infant stages. Slavemaker
colonies are presumably more dependent on the exact
locations of host colonies in WV compared to NY, simply owing to the lower abundance of host colonies in
WV, where the slavemakers have to follow their hosts.

Conclusions
We would like to stress the importance of null models
for comparing existing patterns to random predictions,
especially when regular statistics may fail. For instance,
when testing whether the two host species in the Bavarian community are correlated in space, it was important
to take into account the abundance of each host within
each plot. Earlier analyses based on abundances of parasite and host colonies came to a different conclusion
than the current study. A recent study [29] found a preference of the slavemaker H. sublaevis to one of its two
hosts, while no preference from a spatial point of view
was evident here. Furthermore, parasitism risk was
found to be less important than previously suggested
[29]. Hence, analyzing spatial patterns and locations of
slavemakers and hosts improved our understanding of
the ant slavemaker-host relationships and the impact of
competition.
