Molecular characterisation of virulence graded
field isolates of myxoma virus
Kevin P Dalton*, Ines Nicieza, Aroa Baragaño, Jose Manuel Martín Alonso, Francisco Parra

Abstract
Background: Myxoma virus (MV) has been endemic in Europe since shortly after its deliberate release in France in
1952. While the emergence of more resistant hosts and more transmissible and attenuated virus is well
documented, there have been relatively few studies focused on the sequence changes incurred by the virus as it
has adapted to its new host. In order to identify regions of variability within the MV genome to be used for
phylogenetic studies and to try to investigate causes of MV strain attenuation we have molecularly characterised
nine strains of MV isolated in Spain between the years 1992 and 1995 from wide ranging geographic locations and
which had been previously graded for virulence by experimental infection of rabbits.
Results: The findings reported here show the analysis of 16 genomic regions accounting for approximately 10% of
the viral genomes. Of the 20 genes analysed 5 (M034L, M069L, M071L, M130R and M135R) were identical in all
strains and 1 (M122R) contained only a single point mutation in an individual strain. Four genes (M002L/R, M009L,
M036L and M017L) showed insertions or deletions that led to disruption of the ORFs.
Conclusions: The findings presented here provide valuable tools for strain differentiation and phylogenetic studies
of MV isolates and some clues as to the reasons for virus attenuation in the field.

Background
Myxoma virus (MV) causes myxomatosis in the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). The disease is a
recurrent problem in rabbit farms and in wild rabbit
populations throughout Europe [1-4]. Due to the unique
manner of its introduction into the European rabbit
population, MV provides an excellent model for studying the coevolution of a virus and its host. The complex
virus/host relationship has been shown to lead to the
emergence of more transmissible/attenuated virus
strains and more resistant hosts (for review see [5]).
Such studies have been carried out using experimental
rabbit infections, however, few studies have characterised the sequence changes incurred by the virus during adaptation to its new host [1,6-10].
MV strains are classified into 5 virulence grades (I to
V, I being most virulent and V the most attenuated)
based on the mean survival time of rabbits after infection [10]. Due to the large size of the viral genome

(161.8 kb) restriction fragment length polymorphism
(RFLP) analysis of purified viral genomes has been the
traditional method for the molecular differentiation of
MV strains [6,11]. However, no correlation between
RFLPs and attenuation has been demonstrated [6].
Recent studies of field strains of MV have focussed on
sequencing genes or gene fragments, however, the
majority of these strains have not been characterised for
virulence in rabbits [1,9]. Epidemiological studies on
large numbers of virus isolates are essential to differentiate the types of circulating MV-isolates and to identify
new emergent strains which might have different
degrees of virulence.
Hampered by the large size of the viral genome, to
date only two full-length genome sequences are available, strain Lausanne (Lu) [12] and strain 6918 [8].
These data allowed the first direct comparison between
two full-length MV genomes, one (Lu) being wild-type
(wt) and the other (6918) being attenuated [8].
Strain 6918 was first isolated during field sampling of
MV in Spain [13]. In that study twenty isolates, collected from wide ranging locations between 1992 and
1995, were further characterized for their virulence

grade and horizontal transmission in experimental infections of rabbits. These MV-isolates included a representative example of all five virulence grades providing an
excellent starting biological material for molecular studies on MV strain differentiation and for the investigation of the molecular basis of virus attenuation in the
field.
The aims of the study presented here were to molecularly characterise nine MV isolates [13] and to identify
mutations that could be potential causes for virus
attenuation. In carrying out this study we also aimed to
identify genetic markers for the differentiation of MV
isolates and to identify variable hotspots in the MV genomes therefore providing valuable tools for future epidemiological studies.
To accomplish these objectives preliminary RFLP analysis of purified full-length virus genomes and PCRamplified terminal inverted repeats (TIR) regions were
coupled with a comprehensive sequencing study of 16
genomic regions encompassing 20 genes (14 completely
sequenced and 6 partially sequenced) and 7 intergenic
regions. The sequenced regions covered approximately
10% of the virus genomes. The results of these analyses,
together with the results from the published full
sequence of the attenuated 6918 strain, are discussed
with regard to MV strain differentiation, and potential
causes for virus attenuation.

Results
In order to identify regions of variability in the MV genome to be used for MV strain differentiation, phylogenetic studies and to investigate possible reasons for
virus attenuation we endeavoured to molecularly characterise nine representative strains of MV from the 20 originally isolated in Spain between the years 1992 and
1995 [13] from wide ranging geographic locations (see
Additional file 1). The virus strains had previously been
characterised for their transmissibility and virulence in
rabbits, with each strain given a virulence grade A-E
[13], these grades being exactly equivalent to the grades
I-V previously designated by Fenner and Marshall
(1957). The selected strains were representative of different levels of virulence: 87, 466, 2012 and 86 (grade
A); 2788, 7514 and 1312 (grade B); 7411 (grade C) and
strain 4604 (grade E), which corresponded to a naturally
attenuated MV isolate (See Additional file 2). It should
be mentioned that although strain 6918 (grade E) was
not directly analyzed in the present study the published
sequence data [8] from the relevant regions of this strain
were analyzed together with those from the 9 isolates
studied. This was done because strain 6918 was originally isolated and characterized, in terms of virulence and
transmissibility, under the same conditions [13] as the
strains studied in this paper.

We selected 16 genome regions for sequence analysis
(Table 1) based on the following criteria; 1) previous
publications of MV strain characterisation [3,4,6-8], 2)
publications identifying MV virulence factors [14-23], 3)
RFLP analysis of genomic viral DNA and TIRs obtained
using long-range PCR [24] (data not shown) and 4) proposed ORF functions [12].
The sequences of the investigated genomic regions
included 7 intergenic sequences and 20 complete genes
or gene fragments, representing approximately 10% of
the viral genome.
The sequence data from the 9 MV field strains indicated that two of them (466 and 2012) although isolated
in very distant places in Spain (Additional file 1) could
not be differentiated from one another and should be
considered, with the available sequence data, as a single
virus haplotype. All the remaining strains could be distinguised from each other using the obtained sequence
data. The MV field strain sequences corresponding to
the 16 amplified regions were aligned and compared to
the published 6918 sequences (also isolated in Spain)
and to those from reference strain Lausanne (Lu). Five
of the regions analysed (corresponding to genes or gene
fragments M034, M069, M071, M130 and M135) were
identical (data not shown) in all the analyzed MV
genomes.
In order to facilitate the description and analysis of
the observed mutations in different MV isolates we
have grouped the changes into three categories: those
occurring within intergenic regions (Table 2), in the
TIR (Table 3) or in central regions of the MV genome
(Tables 4 and 5). The mutations are presented using
the format; XpositionY, where X indicates the original
Lu residue (GenBank accession number AF170726),
position refers to the nucleotide number of the Lu
sequence and Y indicates the mutation detected. For
clarity the observed changes are described in separate
sections.
Sequence analysis of intergenic regions

The 7 intergenic regions analyzed corresponded to those
preceding the ORFs M002, M004.1, M005, M008.1,
M017, M122 and M144. Sequence data from all the MV
strains investigated showed that the regions prior to
ORFs M004.1, M005 and M122 did not have any mutations and only those preceding ORFs M002, M008.1,
M017 and M144 had changes (Table 2) in some of the
MV isolates.
The intergenic region (178 nt) between ORFs M002
and M003 of MV Lu reference strain contains 9 copies
of an imperfect tandem repeat (TR) of 12 nt (sequence
CTAATTCGGCTC in the reverse complement of the
genomic sequence) [6] and Figure 1A). Some of the analyzed MV field isolates (86, 7514, 1312, 4604 and 6918)

also contained 9 copies of this repeat (Table 2 and Figure 1B). The remaining MV strains showed changes in
the sequence of this intergenic region. Strains 466, 2012
and 2788 contained 8 copies of the TR sequence due to
a 16 nt deletion in the TR6 region (Figure 1B). Strain
7411 had a 28 nt deletion which removed TR6 and half
of TRs 5 and 7 and therefore contained 7 copies of the
repeat whereas MV isolate 87 contained 11 copies of
the repeated sequence (Table 2 and Figure 1B) due to
an insertion of 28 nts at position 2773 occuring within
the TR5 sequence (Table 2 and Figure 1B).
The intergenic region between genes M017 and M018
contained 4 tandem repeats (sequence ACCTACAT in
the reverse complement) in MV Lu (Figure 2A) and

most of the strains analysed here (Figure 2B). Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that two of these field isolates (7514 and 4604) had a point mutation (Figure 2B)
in TR4. The remaining two MV field strains had either
insertions or deletions in this intergenic region. Isolate
87 contained an additional copy of this repeated
sequence due to an 8 nt insertion following TR2 (Figure
2B) and strain 7411 had only 2 copies of this repeat
(Table 2, Figure 2B) due to the deletion of TR 1 and
TR 2.
The intergenic regions upstream of ORFs M008.1 and
M144 were rather conserved in most MV strains and
contained only single nucleotide point mutations in
strains 87 and 4604 (Table 2).

Sequence analysis of genes from within the TIRs

Considering the previous description of mutations in
field strains as well as the virulence factor coding genes
within the MV genome TIRs we decided to include
three fragments from this region of the genome. For
this purpose we designed three pairs of specific oligonucleotide primers (Table 1) which allowed the analysis of
the full or partial sequences of 5 repeated genes
(M002L/R, M004L/R, M004.1L/R, M005L/R, M007L/R)
from within the TIRs (Table 3). For clarity only the
coordinates of changes occurring in the L-TIR genes are

indicated in the description (the numbering corresponds
to the MV Lu genome GenBank accession number
AF170726).
The M002 ORF sequence was conserved in six field
isolates with respect to that of reference Lu strain.
Strains 1312 and 7411 had nonsynonymous mutations
at positions 2219 and 2393, affecting amino acid residues 143 and 85 of the corresponding protein products,
respectively (Table 3). It should be mentioned that two
different nonsynonymous mutations were also observed
within this ORF (nt. 2497 and 2594) in the previously

sequenced 6918 strain giving rise to non conservative
amino acid substitutions at positions 18 and 50 (Table
3). In contrast to the reasonable conservation of this
ORF in most of the studied field strains the 2788 isolate
contained a single nucleotide insertion at position 2600
which led to a change in the amino acid sequence of
the M002 ORF product from residue 18 onwards and to
its truncation after residue 28 (Table 3).
Previous studies from our laboratory detected an MluI
RFLP in several strains which mapped to the M004/
M004.1/M005 genomic region (data not shown). The
strategy used for sequencing of the entire M004.1L/R
gene (Table 1) also led to partial amplification and
sequencing of the M004L/R and M005L/R genes. In this
region 7 different point mutations were observed in 7 of
the 9 strains analysed (Table 3). Two isolates (4604 and

7514) did not have any changes with respect to reference strain Lu in the entire amplified M004/M004.1/
M005 genomic region. This was also the case for the
previously described strain 6918 although this last isolate had a C5009T mutation which mapped within ORF
M005, outside the region sequenced in the present
study. Strain 7411 contained only a silent mutation
(C4412T) and isolates 466 and 2012 a nonsynonymous
mutation (G4457C; N60K) in the sequenced M004 fragment. Four isolates (86, 87, 466 and 2012) contained a
common nonsynonymous mutation (C4937T; A483T) in
the sequenced M005 fragment, which led to the afore
mentioned MluI RFLP (data not shown). In the fully
sequenced ORF M004.1, isolates 87 and 86 shared two
mutations one silent (G4754A) and one nonsynonymous
(A4750G; F46L) whereas isolates 2788 and 1312

contained two other synonymous mutations (G4715A
and G4775A respectively) not present in any of the
other MV strains studied.
In the M007 gene most studied field strains (86, 466,
2012, 4604, 7411 and 7514) did not have mutations with
respect to reference strain Lu. However, strains 87, 1312
and 2788 contained an identical nonsynonymous mutation (T8394C; Q128R) (Table 3), while strain 1312 contained a further silent mutation (G8456T) in this
genomic region (Table 3). It should be mentioned that
the published sequence of strain 6918 [8] also showed
the presence of a nonsynonymous mutation (G8064A;
S238F) within the M007 gene (Table 3).
Sequence analysis of centrally located genes

In order to investigate putative changes in unique genes
located in the central part of MV genome fifteen genes
(M009L, M010L, M011L, M017L, M034L, M036L,
M069L, M071L, M121R, M122R, M130R, M135R,
M141R, M144R and M148R) were selected for PCR
amplification using specific primers (Table 1) and
nucleotide sequencing. Additional primers used for the
sequencing of genes M009L, M036L and M148R are
shown in Additional file 3. Five of these genes (M034L,
M069L, M071L, M130R and M135R) were identical in
the regions sequenced (data not shown) in all the analyzed MV genomes.

Four strains contained mutations in the M009 gene
(Table 4). Strains 7514, 7411 and 4604 contained nonsynonymous point mutations at different positions, while
strain 1312 contained a two-nucleotide insertion which
led to disruption and truncation of the predicted ORF
(Table 4). The analysis of the published M009L
sequence from 6918 strain [8] showed the presence of a
nonsynonymous point mutation (C12293A; G280C) and
a 10 nt deletion which promoted a frame shift after
amino acid residue 395 (Table 4).
Six genes of this central genome area (M010L, M011L,
M121R, M122R, M141R and M144R) showed a low
number of changes in some of the investigated strains
(Tables 4 and 5). M121 had a single point mutation
(C115910A; S21Y) in strains 2788 and 4604. M122 contained a single silent mutation (G116436A) in strain
2788. The M010L gene was conserved in all strains studied except for the 2788 isolate which contained two
nonsynonymous mutations. M011L showed a single
synonymous mutation which was shared by strains 2788
and 4604.
In the M141 region strains 87 and 86 contained a single
silent mutation (T137666C) and strain 7514 a single nonsynonymous mutation (G137487A; R140Q). Strains 7514
and 7411 contained different nonsynonymous mutations
within the coding region of M144 while strains 7411 and
4604 shared a nonsynonymous mutation (C140143T;

to show a mutation in this region (C140154T).
Gene M148R showed sequence changes in most of the
investigated strains, except for isolate 1312. M148 contained single nonsynonymous mutations in strains 86,
87, 466, 2012 and 4604 while three other isolates (2788,
7514, and 7411) showed two changes, a silent and a
nonsynonymous mutation (Table 5). In the published
6918 sequence [8] M148R showed the presence of a
silent mutation and a single nucleotide deletion
(C142964) which promoted a frame shift.
Gene M017L which was conserved in most of the studied strains, contained insertions or deletions in three of
the field isolates at genome position 18008 following a
homopolymeric stretch of 8 thymidine residues. Strains
2788 and 4604 contained dithymidine insertions and
strain 7411 contained a single thymidine deletion all
promoting frame shifts and truncation of the resulting
gene product (Table 4).
The M036L gene contained mutations in all nine
strains studied when compared to the Lu published

sequence. A single nonsynonymous mutation (T38822C)
was present in 8 of the 9 strains, with strain 7411 the
only strain not to present this mutation. Three strains
(1312, 4604 and 7411) contained different synonymous
mutations in this region and strain 7411 showed a nonsynonymous mutation (G39097A; A52V).
Two homopolymeric stretches within gene M036
were sites of multiple insertion or deletion mutations.
Following a 7 nt homopolymeric stretch of thymidines, at base number 39162, three types of insertion
were observed. Strains 87, 86 and 4604 contained single thymidine insertions, strains 466, 2012 and 7514
contained an insertion of three thymidines while strain
1312 contained an insertion of two thymidine residues. Following a guanosine homopolymeric stretch of
6 nts two strains (87 and 86) had single guanosine
insertions (position 38274), while strain 1312 contained a single guanosine deletion (ΔG38274). The
effects on the predicted ORF lengths of these insertions and deletions have on M036 are described in the
footnote in Table 4.

Discussion
Since the deliberate release of MV in Australia in 1950
and France in 1952 the emergence of more resistant
hosts and the adaptation of virus strains has been well
documented [25,26]. However, few studies have
addressed the sequence changes that have occurred in
the MV genome during this period [1,6,8,9] or more
specifically the sequence changes involved in virus
attenuation. Analysis of the molecular biology of MV in
Australia have identified mutations in field strains [6]
which have been used to study archived MV isolates
and to track virus spread in the field [6,11]. Although
attenuated strains were detected no correlation between
the observed RFLPs and virulence was described. With
the exception of the sequencing of the avirulent strain
6918 [8] and recent analyses of virulent MV circulating
in Portugal and Spain [1,9] extensive studies on the
molecular biology of European strains of MV are lacking, with sequence analysis concentrated on a single
short fragment (491 nts) of the M022 envelope protein
gene [3,4].
In order to bridge this gap in our understanding of
the biology of MV we set out to molecularly characterise nine strains of MV isolated in Spain between the

years 1992 and 1995. These strains were from wide ranging geographic locations from throughout Spain and
had been previously graded for virulence by experimental infection of rabbits, and were chosen because they
represent viruses with markedly different levels of
attenuation [13].
To carry out epidemiological studies of MV it is essential to be able to differentiate between virus strains.
Experimental infection of rabbits is not a suitable method
for large scale continuous MV monitoring, therefore
molecular characterisation of strains is preferable.
Using the mutations detected in this study the majority of the virus strains could be differentiated from one
another. Despite a very high degree of sequence conservation, variable hotspots (regions containing M004L/R,
M036L and M148R) in the genome were detected that
could be used to provide phylogenetic data. We have
not included a phylogenetic analysis using these fragments as the number of samples analysed was small (n
= 9). However, the genetic relatedness of several strains
could be inferred from shared mutations. In particular
strains 466 and 2012, both virulence grade A [13] could
not be differentiated from each other and shared 7
mutations with respect to the Lu sequence. Several

Dalton et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:49
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/49

strains also shared multiple mutations e.g. strains 87 and
86, and strains 2788 and 4604. These results may indicate that particular strains are derived from others or
that the sites and type of mutations observed occur frequently. It is likely that some of the mutations arise frequently and revert showing the dynamic nature of the
virus in the field. Further work will be required to determine if the mutations described are stable at the population level. Interestingly, the strains most related to each
other originate in regions separated by between 500 and
1000 km (see Additional file 1). This observation is
likely the consequece of movement of wild rabbits for
repopulation of areas [27] rather than examples of convergent evolution.
The grossest changes were observed in the intergenic
regions analysed. Deletions and insertions of tandem
repeat sequences were common and have been reported
in the Australian field studies [6]. These mutations are
likely to be too frequent to be useful in phylogenetic
studies.
With the exception of M036L, the highest numbers of
mutations were observed in the terminal regions. Strains
87, 466, 2012 and 86 (all virulence grade A) contained
numerous mutations in the TIRs and immediately flanking regions. Only strains 87 and 86 shared a further
synonymous mutation in the central genome located in
the M141R gene. However, the viruses in which we
observed the highest numbers of mutations in the central regions were viruses that had reduced virulence
grades when compared to Lu [13]. Strains 2788, 7514,
1312 (all grade B), 7411 (grade C) and 4604 (grade E)
all contained mutations to genes in the central more
conserved region of the genome. The presence of these
mutations is surely indicative of the presence of more
mutations yet to be detected, the cumulative effect of
which may explain the attenuation of these strains.
In strain 6918 eighty mutations with respect to Lu
were observed [8] however, it is not yet known which
are responsible for the virus attenuation. Five 6918
genes carried mutations that disrupted ORFs (M009L,
M036L, M069R, M135R and M148R). When the mutations found in the nine strains studied here and the
strain 6918 are compared none were common. However,
our data may provide insights into the reasons for virus
attenuation of some of the nine strains analysed. Four
genes contained mutations that disrupted ORFs,
M002L/R, M009L, M036L and M017L.
M002 (previously termed MT-2) is a tumor necrosis
factor receptor homolog with immunomodulatory functions [28]; reviewed by [29]. Inactivation studies have
shown that M002 is a virulence factor [28]. Strain 2788
contained an insertion that disrupted the M002 ORF,
and was somewhat but not completely attenuated with
respect to Lu (strain 2788 is virulence grade B). While

Page 9 of 12

the analysis of individual genes may give us clues to the
virulence of particular strains it is clear that factors such
as compensatory mutations complicate the study of
attenuation of viruses with large genomes.
While the function of M036 is unknown, disruptions
to the M036 ORF occur in virulent ([6] and this work)
and attenuated strains ([8] and this work) so it is unlikely that this mutation has an effect on virulence. It is
clear that although the full gene product is not necessary for virus replication, it is maintained in the virus
genome and therefore may offer variable regions to target to obtain phylogenetic data.
The M009L gene forms part of the interesting family
of Kelch-like proteins represented in MV Lu genome
by five genes (M006L/R, M008L/R, M009L, M014L
and M140R) 3 as single copies and 2 duplicated at the
left and right TIR. The M009 ORF is disrupted in the
attenuated strain 6918 [8] and strain 1312. Morales et
al., (2008) argue that this mutation is unlikely to be a
critical virulence factor. In the study presented here,
M009L was observed to contain a dinucleotide insertion that disrupted the ORF in strain 1312 and in virulence studies strain 1312 showed a somewhat reduced
virulence (grade B, [13]) but was lethal in all rabbits
infected. This could confirm that this ORF does not
act as a critical virulence factor, however, until the
appropriate knockout viruses are constructed and
tested it cannot be ruled out that this protein plays
some role in virulence.
The function of M017L is unknown. Nevertheless,
considering the truncation of this ORF in strains 2788
and 4604 which showed reduced or complete lack of
virulence respectively it is tempting to speculate that the
truncation of this ORF, when coupled with the other
mutations observed, may have an effect on virulence.
Further work will be required to obtain the full-genome
sequences and elucidate the exact role of the M017 protein in the virus life cycle.
It is unlikely that we have identified all the mutations
responsible for the attenuation of the strains 7411 and
4604, virulence grades C and E respectively. Preliminary
RFLP analysis of full-length genomes and TIRs amplified
by long range PCR showed that no large deletions in the
genomes of these viruses had occurred (data not
shown). It is therefore likely that attenuation is due to
the accumulation of point mutations and only full genome sequencing coupled with mutational analysis will
show why these strains are less virulent.
Interestingly the most attenuated strain used in the
study was strain 4604 which was isolated from the same
region as strain 87, the most virulent isolate studied. No
common mutations were identified between these
strains in this study indicating that there are likely to be
genetically distinct strains circulating in any one region.

Dalton et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:49
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/49

Repeated sampling will be required to show which
strains predominate at present.
One of the most striking questions about the biology
of MV is why should attenuated MV strains arise? The
attenuation of some of the Spanish isolates may reflect a
necessity for a tendency toward attenuation in geographical locations that had low density rabbit populations
at the time of virus isolation [30]. Strains 7514, 1312
and 7411 all come from regions with low density wild
rabbit populations. As MV has no other natural reservoir other than the European rabbit longer survival
times in infected rabbits will increase the likelihood of
encountering a new host or vectors in smaller populations. This is one aspect of virus/host evolution that
could be examined using phylogenetic studies of MV
isolates in Spain.

Conclusions
In summary, the data included in this study provide an
insight into the mechanisms of attenuation of MV
strains and indicates useful targets for use in phylogenetic and epidemiological studies. The genes M004L/R,
M036L and M148R were shown to contain variable
sequences and can be considered possible targets for
genetic relatedness studies. Using the type of data
obtained in this study it will be possible to identify the
types of virus circulating in an epidemic or outbreak,
determine if new virus types are emerging or if one
virus type is predominating in a particular area and be
able to track the spread of these virus types.
Methods
Cells and virus

The nine MV strains used in this study were previously
described and characterised for virulence in rabbits [13]
(See Additional file 2). Each strain is identified by a
number (assigned by [13]), region of origin in Spain (see
Additional file 1) and virulence grade as follows: 87/
Lleida/A, 466/Valencia/A, 2012/Asturias/A, 86/Badajoz/
A, 2788/Albacete/B, 7514/Pontevedra/B, 1312/LaRioja/B,
7411/Canarias/C and 4604/Lleida/E. For simplicity, each
strain is referred to by its identification number only
from this point onwards. It should be mentioned that
although strain 6918/Girona/E was not directly analyzed
in this study the corresponding genome sequences from
this virus isolate were also included in the analyses performed, together with the reference strain Lausanne
(Lu).
Myxoma virus Lu strain and the nine field isolates
listed above were grown and titered in RK13 cells which
were maintained in Dulbecco’s-modified Eagle medium
(DMEM (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA)) supplemented with 10%
foetal calf serum (FCS - PAA laboratories, UK) and 40
mg/L gentamicin (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA). To avoid the

Page 10 of 12

accumulation of mutations associated with virus adaptation to tissue culture the MV isolates were not passaged
more than 3 times prior to genomic RFLP studies and
were not passaged more than once for genome sequencing studies.
MV DNA purification

For preliminary RFLP studies using full-length viral genomes we used the hypotonic burst method to rupture
cells followed by PEG precipitation of virions as
described previously [31]. Partially purified virions were
treated with DNaseI (15 units, 1 h, 37°C; Fermentas).
DNA was extracted from precipitated virions using a
commercial kit (Masterpure™ Complete DNA and RNA
purification kit, Epicentre® Biotechnologies), following
the total DNA purification protocol.
To obtain viral DNA for PCR and sequencing studies,
total DNA was extracted from infected RK13 cell monolayers using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
The long-range PCR used for the detection of RFLPs
in the TIR regions was previously described [24]. The
oligonucleotides used for the PCR amplification of the
MV genomic regions for sequence analysis are shown in
Table 1. Additional primers used for the sequencing of
genes M009L, M036L and M148R are shown in Additional file 3. The genes that were completely or partially
sequenced were distributed (Additional file 4) along the
full MV genome including both at right and left TIR
and within the central not repeated sequences.
Cycle conditions were as follows; 94°C 2 min, then 35
cycles of 94°C 30 seconds, 55°C 30 seconds and 68°C 30
sec-2 min, with a final extension of 5-10 min at 68°C.
Reactions were carried out using TaKaRa LA Taq
(Takara, Madison, WI) in 1 × reaction buffer, 2.5 mM
MgCl2, 2.5 mM of each dNTP, 2.5 units of enzyme and
0.2 μM of each oligonucleotide.
DNA analysis, gels and software

Agarose (SeaKem Gold Agarose [Lonza, Basel, Switzerland]) gels (0.75%) in 0.04 M Tris, 1.14% acetic acid and
0.002 M EDTA (TAE) were run at room temperature
and stained with ethidium bromide or with 1 × SYBR
green stain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
PCR reaction products were analysed by agarose gel
electrophoresis. Full size PCR products were cut from
gels using alcohol cleaned scalpel blades and purified
using the Wizard SV gel and PCR clean-up system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Purified PCR products or
MV genomic DNA were quantified on agarose gels by
comparison with quantified DNA markers (GenerulerPlus, Takara, Madison, WI) and either subjected to
digestions using a variety of restriction enzymes (as per
manufacturer’s instructions) for RFLP studies or 50 ng

Dalton et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:49
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/49

of DNA were mixed with 10 μM of the appropriate oligonucleotide and sequenced.
Agarose gels were photographed using the Gel logic
200I system, and images were analysed with Kodak
Molecular Imaging software (Version 4), Kodak (NY,
U.S.A).
Sequence analysis

An ABI PRISM® 3130×l Genetic Analyzer (Sequencing
services, Universidad de Oviedo) was used to sequence
all gel purified PCR products and Chromas LITE freeware (Version 2.01- http://www.technelysium.com.au)
was used to analyse sequences and to convert data to
text format for subsequent alignment analysis.
Vector NTi version 11 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) software was used for all alignment analysis. The full-length
sequences for Lu and strain 6918 were obtained from
the NCBI database with the accession numbers
AF170726 and EU552530 respectively.
