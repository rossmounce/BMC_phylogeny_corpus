Abstract
Background: Aspergillus nidulans is a member of a diverse group of filamentous fungi, sharing many
of the properties of its close relatives with significance in the fields of medicine, agriculture and
industry. Furthermore, A. nidulans has been a classical model organism for studies of development
biology and gene regulation, and thus it has become one of the best-characterized filamentous fungi.
It was the first Aspergillus species to have its genome sequenced, and automated gene prediction
tools predicted 9,451 open reading frames (ORFs) in the genome, of which less than 10% were
assigned a function.
Results: In this work, we have manually assigned functions to 472 orphan genes in the metabolism
of A. nidulans, by using a pathway-driven approach and by employing comparative genomics tools
based on sequence similarity. The central metabolism of A. nidulans, as well as biosynthetic
pathways of relevant secondary metabolites, was reconstructed based on detailed metabolic
reconstructions available for A. niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and information on the genetics,
biochemistry and physiology of A. nidulans. Thereby, it was possible to identify metabolic functions
without a gene associated, and to look for candidate ORFs in the genome of A. nidulans by
comparing its sequence to sequences of well-characterized genes in other species encoding the
function of interest. A classification system, based on defined criteria, was developed for evaluating
and selecting the ORFs among the candidates, in an objective and systematic manner. The
functional assignments served as a basis to develop a mathematical model, linking 666 genes (both
previously and newly annotated) to metabolic roles. The model was used to simulate metabolic
behavior and additionally to integrate, analyze and interpret large-scale gene expression data
concerning a study on glucose repression, thereby providing a means of upgrading the information
content of experimental data and getting further insight into this phenomenon in A. nidulans.
Conclusion: We demonstrate how pathway modeling of A. nidulans can be used as an approach
to improve the functional annotation of the genome of this organism. Furthermore we show how
the metabolic model establishes functional links between genes, enabling the upgrade of the
information content of transcriptome data.

Background
Aspergillus nidulans, also known as Emericella nidulans,
as it can undergo sexual reproduction in its life cycle in
addition to the non-perfect (asexually reproducing) form
that characterizes aspergilli, is an important member of
the filamentous fungal genus Aspergillus. This genus
encompasses a large diversity of species of great medical
and economical relevance. In the medical and agricultural
fields, A. flavus and A. parasiticus represent major producers of mycotoxins (e.g. aflatoxins) that can contaminate
important food and feed crops, while A. fumigatus may
cause serious diseases in immuno-compromised animals
and humans (e.g. invasive pulmonary aspergillosis).
From a biotechnological viewpoint, Aspergillus species
represent important industrial producers of diverse products, such as industrial enzymes (e.g. amylases by A. niger
and A. oryzae), bulk chemicals (e.g. citric acid by A. niger),
and pharmaceuticals (e.g. lovastatin, a cholesterol lowering-agent, by A. terreus).
Whereas the first efforts made in fungal genome research
have focused on yeasts, there has been an increasing focus
on filamentous fungi due to their medical, agricultural
and biotechnological importance. There are quite large
differences between yeast and most filamentous fungal
genomes, with the latter exhibiting larger genomes owing
to larger centromers and lower gene density per nucleotide length as well as the presence of far more genes. Furthermore, many of the filamentous fungal genes have a
more complex structure due to the presence of multiple
introns [1]. A. nidulans has become one of the model
organisms of choice for filamentous fungal genome
research as it is a representative of the important group of
aspergilli, but also because this fungus has served as a
model organism for studies of cell development and gene
regulation [2]. It is one of the most extensively studied
organisms in the fields of genetics and biochemistry, and
this is obviously of great value in the identification of the
function of orphan filamentous fungal genes and characterization of the biological roles of their products.
Genome-sequencing projects of several Aspergillus species have recently been completed (A. fumigatus, A. nidulans, A. niger, A. oryzae, A. parasiticus) or are nearing
completion (A. flavus, A. terreus) [3,4]. In particular, the
genomic sequence of A. nidulans (strain FGSC A4) was
released by the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, with
a13-fold coverage, in Spring 2003 [5]. The size of its
genome is approximately 31 Mb, and it is organized in 8
chromosomes. 9,541 open reading frames (ORFs) were
predicted using automated gene prediction tools
(FGENESH, FGENESH+, and GENEWISE), and PFAM
(protein family) [6] matches were identified by Hmmer
analysis. However, due to the highly conservative criteria
adopted in the gene naming process, and also due to the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/163

relative low number of genes characterized before whole
genome sequencing, more than 90% of all ORFs identified are called hypothetical or predicted proteins.
In order to improve the predictions and improve the
annotation, automatically assigned genes should be subjected to manual curation. Herein, integration of different
types of data and combination of diverse genomic tools
play a major role. Functional assignments of genes based
on genomic data may be complemented with information
providing biochemical and physiological evidence. Of
special importance in functional genomics are highthroughput data generated by post-genomic techniques
(e.g. transcriptome data using hybridization arrays [7]),
which provide genome-wide screens of gene function
[3,8,9]. In addition to similarity-based tools (e.g. BLAST
[10], FASTA [11]), a number of methods are available for
comparative genomics that combine various types of
genomic evidence, such as protein fusion events [12],
gene clustering on the chromosome [13], occurrence profiles or signatures [14], shared regulatory sites [15], which
enable the so-called "gene context analysis" [16].
Metabolic reconstructions can give a valuable contribution to functional genomics, by uncovering missing metabolic functions (i.e., functions not assigned to genes)
and hence putting forward the identification of the corresponding genes [16,17]. The underlying idea is that larger
functional systems (e.g. metabolic pathways) require the
presence of their components or elementary functional
units (e.g. enzymatic steps) in order to be operative.
Hence, in this approach, efforts are directed towards discovering (uncharacterized) genes within the sequenced
genome that have a defined role in the metabolism, in
opposition to strategies that aim at predicting the functions of a given set of genes known to be present. Comparative genome analysis may then be accomplished with
well-characterized genes of related organisms, by employing diverse tools of comparative genomics (based on
sequence similarity and gene context), and a prioritized
list of potential candidate genes for the function of interest generated. The functional assignment of genes may be
verified eventually by using experimental techniques. This
approach has been previously described by Osterman and
Overbeek [16], and a computational method has been
developed for automated large-scale predictions of protein function [18]. This framework has been applied to
prokaryotes (Thiobacillus ferrooxidans [19]) and eukaryotes (human [20]), and here we used it for the annotation
of metabolic genes within the genome of A. nidulans.
In particular, we focused on the functional annotation of
the genes involved in the central metabolism of this fungus, as well as on the biosynthetic pathways of relevant
secondary metabolites. For the purpose, we reconstructed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/163

the central metabolic network of A. nidulans, based on
detailed metabolic reconstructions of other eukaryotes,
namely A. niger [21], Saccharomyces cerevisiae [22], and
Mus musculus [23]. In what concerns the secondary
metabolism, pathways for the biosynthesis of penicillin in
Penicillium chrysogenum [24] and aflatoxins in different
species of Aspergillus [25] were used as templates. Pathway prediction was also supported by available information on the biochemistry and physiology of A. nidulans.
Our analysis assigned functions to 472 orphan ORFs in
the metabolism of A. nidulans, by employing similaritybased tools of comparative genomic analysis (BLAST) and
using public (non-redundant) databases of genes and proteins of established function [26]. These functions represented either missing enzymatic activities, for which no
ORFs had been previously identified, or previously
assigned functions, for which additional isogenes were
discovered. The functional assignments made for the individual ORFs were integrated into a mathematical model
that can be used to simulate metabolic behavior, thereby
enabling a comprehensive and integrative analysis of metabolic functions in A. nidulans. Furthermore, the information contained in the metabolic reconstruction can be
exploited for the analysis of large-scale transcription data.
To illustrate this, the reconstructed metabolic network of
A. nidulans was used in connection with an algorithm
developed by Patil and Nielsen [27] for the large-scale
analysis of gene expression profiles, in particular for studying transcriptional responses to specific genetic changes
in A. nidulans (deletion of the regulatory gene creA) [28].
In a previous study, the metabolic network reconstructed
in this work was employed in the study of the effects of
changes in the environmental conditions (carbon source)
on the transcriptome profiles of A. nidulans [29].

Results
Metabolic reconstruction and identification of candidate
ORFs
The pathways predicted to take part in the central metabolism of A. nidulans, as well as those involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites of interest, are listed in
Tables 1 and 2 and Additional file 1. Our analysis assigned
metabolic roles to 472 ORFs within the genome of A. nidulans that had not been annotated earlier (Table 1). In
total, 666 ORFs were associated to functions in the metabolic reconstruction, including 194 previously annotated
ORFs in the Aspergillus nidulans Database [5]. However,
the correlation between the ORFs and metabolic functions is rather complex, because about 92 ORFs were
found to be constituents of enzyme complexes, more than
100 ORFs were considered to be multifunctional, and
approximately 190 ORFs to encode various isoenzymes.
The reconstructed metabolic network included 676
unique biochemical reactions (551 cytosolic, 103 mitochondrial, 5 glyoxysomal, and 17 extracellular) and 113
unique transport processes. The analysis did not include
transporters, and hence the transport reactions considered
were based on those existing in related organisms, based
on previous annotations for A. nidulans or concerned diffusional processes. Moreover, Additional file 1 includes
information on the common metabolic reactions to A.
nidulans and A. niger or S. cerevisiae networks.

Table 2 presents the number of biochemical reactions
involved in each part of the metabolism considered in the
analysis, as well as the number of transport processes. In
addition, Table 2 shows the number of unique reactions
and transport processes predicted to participate in the different parts of the metabolism of A. nidulans that are
common to the metabolic networks of A. niger and S. cerevisiae.

The number of unique reactions in the metabolic network of A. nidulans is shown in parenthesis. The metabolic functions may be or not assigned to
ORFs.
1 Note that the metabolic network for A. niger is only detailed for the metabolism of C-compounds (the other parts of the metabolism are
represented by lumped reactions) [21], which justifies the relatively low number of reactions in common to both networks in what concerns the
other parts of the metabolism.
2 6 non-enzymatic steps are included.

Evaluation of functional assignments
The reliability of the functional assignments was evaluated according to the criteria described in Materials and
Methods, and the candidate ORFs were classified into categories, as shown in Additional file 1. The definition of
these criteria, in particular of the cut-off values in the Evalues of BLAST searches, was found to strongly determine
the number of candidate ORFs to consider for each metabolic function, and hence the reactions to include in the
metabolic network for A. nidulans. The lists of the ORFs
considered for each of the metabolic functions, for different stringencies of the criteria (i.e. cut-off in E-values) is
presented in Additional file 2, whereas the data presented
in Additional file 1 refer to a cut-off E-values of 1E-50.
Functions with no ORF associated
After employing the algorithm described above, some of
the metabolic functions predicted to occur in A. nidulans
still remained without a link to a specific ORF in the
genome. These metabolic functions corresponded to biochemical conversions for which no ORFs (hits) were identified by homology-based comparative analysis, or to
those candidate ORFs that were subsequently neglected
for not complying with the criteria considered (see Results
– Evaluation of functional assignments). Nevertheless, 33
of these metabolic functions (or biochemical reactions)
were considered to be part of the metabolic network, since

they were essential for growth (see Results – Essential
genes).
Metabolic model
The metabolic reconstruction served as a basis to develop
a mathematical model that describes the stoichiometry of
all the metabolic processes in A. nidulans. The model
comprised 1213 metabolic reactions, of which 1095 were
biochemical transformations and 118 were transport
processes. In addition, the model included 732 metabolites that could be balanced, i.e. metabolites whose net
rate of their formation could be balanced with their net
rate of consumption. Out of the 1213 reactions, there
were 794 unique reactions (681 unique biochemical conversions and 113 unique transport processes), i.e. 419 of
the reactions in the metabolic network were redundant.
All the reactions in the metabolic network are listed in
Additional file 1, along with a list of the abbreviations
considered for the metabolite names (Additional file 2).
Compartmentation was considered and the allocation of
the biochemical conversions and metabolites to the different intracellular compartments (cytosol, mitochondria,
and glyoxysomes) was based on the metabolic models for
A. niger and S. cerevisiae. Besides catabolic and biosynthetic pathways, the model also included polymerization
reactions and a reaction describing the formation of biomass, which was considered as a drain of building blocks

or macromolecules in appropriate ratios to produce 1
mmol of monomers in the macromolecule or 1 g dryweight (DW), respectively. These ratios were calculated
based on the composition of the macromolecules in terms
of building blocks (taken from A. oryzae [30]) and on the
composition of biomass in terms of macromolecules
(taken from A. nidulans [31] for lipids and A. oryzae [30]
for the remaining macromolecules). A reaction representing the consumption of ATP for non-growth associated
purposes was also included in the metabolic model. The
ATP costs in the polymerization of amino acids and nucleotides were predicted based on reports for P. chrysogenum [32]. Furthermore, the ATP requirement for the
assembly of macromolecules (19 mmol ATP/g DW) and
for maintenance (2.85 mmol ATP/(g DW.h)) were estimated based on experimental biomass yields of A. nidulans grown in glucose-limited chemostat cultures for
different dilution rates [33]. The values calculated were
comparable with those reported for A. niger and P. chrysogenum [21].
Model predictions
Essential genes
Single gene deletions were simulated and the capability of
the corresponding mutants to grow on several carbon
sources was determined (minimal media, no supplements). Table 3 shows the number of metabolic functions
that were predicted to be essential for growth of A. nidulans on each of the four different substrates studied (glucose, xylose, glycerol, and ethanol), along with a list of the
essential genes. The results from these studies were used to
further refine the metabolic model. In fact, these investigations provided evidence for the existence of some metabolic steps for which no assignments were made based
on homology searches. Therefore, these "missing functions" were considered to be part of the metabolic network for the sake of having an operative metabolic model.
Biomass yields
The model was simulated to predict the maximum theoretical growth yields of A. nidulans on different carbon
sources. Fig. 1 shows a comparison of these values with
the maximum theoretical growth yields predicted for A.
niger [21] and experimentally observed yields for A.
oryzae in carbon-limited chemostat cultures [34]. All
computations were performed considering the experimental substrate uptake rates in order to account for the
relative effect of substrate consumption for maintenance
purposes.
Integration of large-scale expression analysis data
The reconstructed metabolic network was used in combination with data from large-scale transcriptional studies
conducted with A. nidulans, in order to detect overall metabolic responses to specific genetic and environmental

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/163

perturbations, using an algorithm developed by Patil and
Nielsen [27]. This algorithm integrates gene expression
data with topological information from metabolic models and enables the identification of small and coordinated changes in expression levels due to genetic or
environmental perturbations. By using this algorithm, it is
possible to identify highly regulated or reporter metabolites (i.e. metabolites around which the most significant
changes in transcription occur) and highly correlated subnetworks (i.e. sets of connected genes with significant and
coordinated transcriptional response to a perturbation),
which enable to uncover metabolic responses to perturbations from transcriptional profiles.
The expression data sets used in this study represented the
transcription levels of approximately one third of all predicted ORFs in A. nidulans (i.e. 3,278 ORFs) and concerned a reference strain grown on media containing
different carbon sources (either glucose or ethanol), as
well as a mutant strain that was impaired in the carbon
repression system due to deletion of the carbon catabolite
repressor gene creA [28]. Transcription analysis was therefore carried out for triplicates of four different cultivation
conditions, namely the reference strain grown on glucose,
the reference strain grown on ethanol, the creA mutant
strain grown on glucose, and the creA mutant strain
grown on ethanol. Differentially expressed genes were
identified by using a two-way ANOVA, resulting in the calculation of two p-values for each ORF: a p-value concerning the effect of the growth medium, which was
independent of the genotype of the strain, and a p-value
concerning the effect of the genotype, which was independent of the medium used. Of the 3,278 ORFs included
in the expression data sets, 571 ORFs were represented in
the metabolic model developed in this study and thus the
corresponding transcription profiles were considered for
the analysis of reporter metabolites and metabolic subnetworks. The top 30 reporter metabolites, ranked according
to p-values concerning the effect of the medium and genotype, are listed in Table 4. It was observed that, out of the
top 30 reporter metabolites identified for each category
(i.e. differential expression according to medium or genotype), only 8 metabolites were common to both categories, i.e. genes connected to these metabolites were
regulated as both a result of the carbon source and the
mutation. Moreover, 4 out of these 8 metabolites were
involved in amino acid biosynthesis (namely N-Acetyl-Lglutamate 5-phosphate (mitochondrial), L-Tyrosine, N(L-Arginino)succinate, N-Acetyl-L-glutamate 5-semialdehyde (mitochondrial)), and the highest ranked reporter
metabolites in each category were involved in the biosyntheses of the amino-acids arginine and threonine.
Methanol, ethanol, and acetaldehyde were also found as
very highly ranked reporter metabolites in the list con-

Number and list of essential ORFs in A. nidulans for growth on any of the four carbon sources investigated, namely glucose, xylose, glycerol, and ethanol. The total
number of metabolic reactions that are essential for growth, with or without an ORF associated is shown in parenthesis.
1 Some ORFs encode enzymes that participate in different parts of the metabolism, but these are represented only once in the table.
2 This list corresponds to all essential genes for growth on glucose, which also revealed to be essential for growth on any of the other carbon sources. However,
additional genes were predicted to be essential on xylose (AN6037.2), glycerol (AN6037.2), and ethanol (AN6037.2, AN2916.2/AN2332.2/AN8793.2, AN8707.2,
AN6653.2).
3 In these cases, the number of essential ORFs may be greater than the number of essential biochemical conversions due to the presence of enzyme complexes.

of the differential regulation of a whole set of dehydrogenases, and is also suggested by the emergence of NAD+
and NADH as reporter metabolites. Moreover, L-xylulose
and D-sorbitol, which are involved in the metabolism of
polyols, were ranked second and third, respectively, in the
list of reporter metabolites concerning the effect of the
genotype. Furthermore, it was observed that metabolites
participating in the formation of secondary metabolites
(e.g. sterigmatocystin) were among the 30 most highly
regulated metabolites.
In order to obtain a more general overview of the effect of
changing environmental/genetic conditions on the
metabolism, the results obtained were subjected to further
analysis. For the purpose, we made use of the links
between the metabolic models available for A. nidulans
and S. cerevisiae, which enabled to transfer specific tools
for the analysis of -omics data in yeast to A. nidulans.

Analysis of reporter metabolites and neighboring enzymes, using the "GO term finder" available at the Saccharomyces Genome Database [35] and
the corresponding ORFs in yeast, retrieved via the reconstructed metabolism of S. cerevisiae [22].

Thus, all the enzymes associated to the top 30 reporter
metabolites (listed in Table 4) were identified through the
metabolic reconstruction developed for A. nidulans.
Based on the EC numbers of these enzymes, the corresponding ORFs in S. cerevisiae were retrieved via a
genome-scale metabolic model previously developed for
yeast [22]. The "GO" terms associated to the yeast ORFs
were then used to further study the metabolic effects of
changing the carbon source and the genotype, using the
"GO term finder" available at the Saccharomyces Genome
Database [35] (see Table 5). The analysis of GO terms
showed that, even though changes in the carbon source
and genotype were reflected in common parts of the
metabolism (e.g. carboxylic acid and organic acid metabolism), there were also clear differences between the
effects exerted by the two categories. The change of carbon
source seemed to affect mainly the energy metabolism of
the cells, whereas a mutation that disturbs the carbon
repression mechanism seemed to have a significant
impact on the amino acid metabolism.

there was a large potential for functional annotation of
metabolic genes. This potential was demonstrated by the
functional assignment of 472 orphan ORFs. Yet, a number
of issues arose in the course of the annotation of the metabolic genes in A. nidulans.

Discussion

Another issue is that our identification of candidate ORFs
encoding a given function relied on comparative analysis,
based on sequence similarity between the proteins in A.
nidulans and other organisms. However, there probably
exist enzymes in A. nidulans that are encoded by genes
with low similarity to those encoding the same function

Metabolic reconstruction
According to the Aspergillus nidulans Database [5], only
194 of the metabolic ORFs included in the metabolic
model developed for A. nidulans had been assigned a
function in the metabolism before this study, and hence

One of these issues was related to limitations inherent to
a pathway-driven gene finding approach. In particular, the
use of metabolic networks from selected organisms as references does not allow the identification of metabolic
functions that are not present in these templates. In this
way, additional or alternative reactions or pathways to
these templates that may make part of the metabolic network of A. nidulans will not be predicted to exist, and subsequently the corresponding genes will not be identified
using this methodology. In order to minimize this, the
metabolic networks used as reactions databases in this
work concerned organisms closely related to A. nidulans,
and thus the major part of the metabolic reactions present
in this fungus were likely to be covered.

in other organisms. Hence, queries based on BLAST
searches will not result in identification of such genes.
This problem was partially overcome by using, as queries,
proteins of phylogenetically related organisms, for which
many genes are likely to be conserved.
As alternatives to analytical tools relying on sequence similarity, there are tools based on genome context. However,
gene clustering on the chromosome and analysis of
shared regulatory sites as well as motif profiling are
mainly relevant for comparative genomics in prokaryotes
[16].
The selection of ORFs among the candidates encoding
each function involved the specification of certain criteria
and the development of a classification system. Hereby
the reliability of the assignment of specific metabolic
functions to candidate ORFs could be evaluated objectively and systematically, and furthermore it was possible
to classify each annotation into categories according to
the criteria defined. These criteria were essentially based
on the E-values of BLAST searches and on the consistency
between the function of interest and the function of the
BLAST hits. All ORFs that were classified into at least one
of the categories defined (A/A*, F, Y/Y* and O/O*, see
Material and Methods – Evaluation of functional assignments) were considered in the metabolic model, whereas
the ORFs that did not fall into any of the categories were
not incorporated in the model. The categories A*, Y*, and
O* were included to take into account also those ORFs for
which the results from the comparative analysis were not
conclusive, but did not contradict the function in question (e.g. aldose reductase versus xylose reductase; mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase versus cytosolic
isocitrate dehydrogenase). In this way, we aimed at identifying all ORFs that were associated to a given function
(which might also represent isoenzymes or subunits of
enzyme complexes), even though, by not being so stringent, we may have run into the problem of also finding
false positives. Furthermore, assignment of ORFs to these
categories may be valuable in future annotation studies.
The choice of the cut-off E-value in the BLAST searches is
obviously determining the quality of our annotation. A
number of factors influence the E-values in BLAST
searches, such as the length of the queries and the size of
the databases. Hence, the candidate ORFs were ranked
according to the score to length ratio, as it hereby was possible to compensate for the fact that smaller proteins lead
to higher E-values (smaller scores) in BLAST searches,
because the probability of finding them by chance in the
database is higher. Moreover, in order to have an idea on
the order of magnitude of reasonable E-values for the different BLAST searches, previously annotated ORFs were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/163

used as positive controls. However, universal criteria may
not apply, since the proteins' sequences may have diverse
properties in the different parts of the metabolism (size,
content, etc). Therefore, a sensitivity analysis was performed, in which different cut-off values in the E-values
were considered in the BLAST searches. The stringency of
this criterion determined the number of metabolic functions assigned to ORFs, as well as the number of ORFs
considered for each function (see Additional file 3). A cutoff of 1E-50 in the E-values was found to be reasonable
and hence this value was chosen for all BLAST searches in
the selection of candidate ORFs and development of the
metabolic model.
On the other hand, the differences in the order of magnitude of the E-values in the different BLASTP searches carried out can explain the fact that some ORFs were not
classified into the category O (i.e., have an homolog, different from the query sequence, in the NCBI protein database [26]). It would be expected that all candidate ORFs
would fall into this category, since these were found using
as queries, protein sequences retrieved from this database.
However, by setting the same cut-off in the E-values for all
BLASTP searches, we may have been too stringent in some
cases, namely when searching homologs for the candidate
ORFs in the protein database at NCBI, which is a very large
database and hence the probability of finding the query
sequence by chance is high, resulting in high E-values.
As mentioned above, all BLAST hits for a given function
whose E-values were below the cut-off and that were classified into at least one of the categories described were
considered to encode that function. However, in some
cases, the discrimination between ORFs encoding isoenzymes and subunits of enzyme complexes was difficult,
particularly for those cases in which there was no information available for A. nidulans or this could not be directly
extrapolated from other organisms. For example, even
though in S. cerevisiae there are two genes (YDR341C and
YHR091C) encoding the enzyme arginyl tRNA synthetase
(EC 6.1.1.19), only a single ORF (AN6368.2) was identified in A. nidulans, through BLASTP searches. Similarly, a
single ORF was found in A. nidulans (AN5610.2) for Laminoadipate-semialdehyde
dehydrogenase
(EC
1.2.1.31), which is a complex enzyme in yeast containing
two subunits (a large and a small subunit), encoded by
two different genes (YBR115C and YGL154C, respectively).
This study therefore shows clearly that the outcome of
comparative genomics is highly dependent on the criteria
chosen, and also highlights the importance of the application of a systematic evaluation to the obtained annotations.

Analysis of expression data using the metabolic network
topology
Transcriptomics has become a cornerstone of functional
genomics over the last decade and the analysis and interpretation of microarray data has proven to be a new challenge. Even for well-studied model organisms, the
analysis and interpretation of transcriptome data is often
hampered by the numerous genes that have no function
assigned. This becomes even more evident when transcriptomics moves on to genomes whose annotation
barely relies on automated gene prediction. In these cases,
basically any additional information can be very helpful
for the analysis and interpretation of data. As shown previously by our group, the metabolic network reconstructed in this work can be valuable for upgrading the
information content in transcriptome data [29], i.e. to
provide a link between gene expression profiles and integrated metabolic functions. The importance of the reconstructed metabolic network in the analysis of
transcriptome data of A. nidulans was again illustrated in
this work with a study concerning transcriptional
responses to changes in the growth medium composition
(glucose and ethanol) of a wild type strain and a mutant
strain with deletion of the regulatory protein CreA [28].
The initial transcription data set used comprised 3,278
ORFs, of which 571 ORFs had an assigned function in the
metabolic network. Although the selected expression data
subset (consisting of 571 ORFs) did not cover the whole
metabolic network reconstructed for A. nidulans, the
reporter metabolites identified after applying the method
from Patil and Nielsen [27], still provided valuable information on the underlying metabolic changes, which
reflects the robustness of the method.

For both categories (differential expression according to
growth medium or genotype), the highest ranked reporter
metabolites were involved in the biosynthesis of amino
acids (arginine and threonine, respectively) (Table 4),
which was not expected, since it was anticipated that the
different environmental/genetic conditions would mainly
affect the carbon metabolism. In particular for the transcriptional responses due to changes in the carbon source,
the involvement of the amino acid metabolism was further reflected in many of the other reporter metabolites
(Table 4).
On the other hand, this approach may play an important
role in functional genomics, by giving insight into the perturbations that lead to specific transcriptional responses
(for example, in the analysis of strains that are mutated in
genes with unknown function). In fact, from the list of
reporter metabolites presented in Table 4, it is possible to
deduce that major changes occurred in the metabolism of
carbon compounds in A. nidulans, in particular in the
metabolism of ethanol (from reporter metabolites, such

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/163

as ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetate, acetyl-CoA, etc.). However, tracing back the underlying perturbations from the
topology of the network and observed transcriptional
responses is still a challenging task, even for well-studied
organisms.
Furthermore, the reconstructed metabolic network for A.
nidulans allows the utilization of tools that have been
developed by the yeast community for the analysis of omics data. This represents an advantage, because one can
rely on the linkage of the expression data to a specific reaction rather than to a specific gene. After identification of
the reporter metabolites and the reactions in which they
participate, the reconstructed metabolic network of S. cerevisiae can be used to identify ORFs in yeast that are
involved in the same reactions and use these for further
analysis. As an example, the "GO term finder" available at
Saccharomyces Genome Database was used to identify
specific parts of the metabolism related to the reporter
metabolites. The results (reporter metabolites) obtained
based on the differential expression according to the
medium revealed many GO categories that could be
directly linked to the change of the carbon source from
glucose to ethanol, and therefore again showed that by
using this approach one can obtain a birds-eye view on
the major metabolic changes. The results based on the
changes in the genotype of the strains, i.e. deletion of the
carbon repression mediator CreA, showed that the highest
ranked reporter metabolite, as well as other lower ranking
ones, was involved in the amino acid biosynthesis, which
was also confirmed by the GO term analysis. This linkage
between glucose repression and amino acid biosynthesis
was further substantiated by the finding that a defined set
of genes that is regulated via CreA also has binding sites
for CpcA (homologue of GNC4 from S. cerevisiae) that is
a major regulator of the amino acid metabolism [28]. This
shows that apparently the CreA protein is not only
involved in the mediation of carbon repression, but plays
an even more global role in the metabolism of the cell.
The emergence of polyols in the list of reporter metabolites confirms previously reported results [36,37], and the
expression data therefore allow tracking down the origin
of these changes in the metabolism.

Conclusion
In this work, we illustrated the use of a pathway-driven
approach to improve the functional annotation of the
genome of A. nidulans. Moreover, we showed how the
metabolic reconstruction establishes functional links
between genes, enabling the upgrade of the information
content of transcriptome data.

based on the method previously described by Osterman
and Overbeek [16]. The different steps carried out are
depicted in Fig. 2 and 3, and described in the following.
Metabolic reconstruction
The central metabolism of A. nidulans, as well as selected
pathways from its secondary metabolism, was reconstructed using as templates detailed metabolic reconstructions of other organisms. For the reconstruction of the
metabolism of carbon compounds in A. nidulans, a
detailed metabolic reconstruction for A. niger [21] was
used as reaction database, whereas the metabolisms of
amino acids, nucleotides, and lipids were predicted based
on reactions identified in S. cerevisiae [22], for which a
more comprehensive reconstructed metabolic network
was available. As the energy metabolism of S. cerevisiae is
simpler than for many other eukaryotic cells, the energy

metabolism of A. nidulans was reconstructed using as references the corresponding pathways from both yeast [22]
and mouse [23]. The biosynthetic routes of secondary
metabolites, namely penicillin and aflatoxins, were based
on detailed studies of these pathways in P. chrysogenum
[24] and in different species of Aspergillus [25], respectively. Evidence for the presence of these pathways in A.
nidulans was in part supported by available genomic data,
such as previously annotated ORFs [5], sequenced and
cloned genes (with or without an ORF associated) [38],
Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) [39] and Tentative Consensus sequences (TCs) [40]. The metabolic pathways in
A. nidulans were also predicted based on biochemical evidence given by reports on isolation and characterization
of enzymes in this fungus [41,42]. Furthermore, the inclusion of some reactions in the metabolic reconstruction of
A. nidulans was supported solely by physiological evi-

dence (e.g. the ability to grow on a certain sugar as the sole
carbon and energy sources require a transporter and a
complete pathway for metabolism of this sugar).
The directionality and reversibility of the reactions
included in the metabolic network of A. nidulans were
based on those in the metabolic networks of other organisms that served as templates for the reconstruction.
Identification of candidate ORFs
Once the metabolic network of A. nidulans was reconstructed and the missing functional roles identified, the
genome of A. nidulans was surveyed for the genes encoding the corresponding enzymes, by employing comparative genomics tools based on sequence similarity. This
approach was also applied for the identification of ORFs
encoding metabolic functions that had been previously
assigned to genes in A. nidulans, aiming at identifying isogenes. The sequences of a set of proteins with the designated enzymatic activity in other organisms (queries)
were compared with the set of all predicted proteins in A.
nidulans [5]. The protein sequences used as queries were

obtained from the (non-redundant) NCBI protein database [26] (searched by the corresponding enzyme commission numbers whenever possible), and represented
well-characterized enzymes in other organisms, preferentially in organisms taxonomically related to A. nidulans
(e.g. fungi or eukaryota). BLASTP (blosum62) was used
for comparative analysis and assigning metabolic functions to ORFs in the genome of A. nidulans. The selection
of the best candidate ORFs for a given function relied on
the cut-off in the expectation values (E-values) considered, as well as on the score-to-sequence length ratio. Protein sequences or translated nucleotide sequences were
used in the comparisons, rather than nucleotide
sequences, due to the presence of introns, which characterizes eukaryota, and thus filamentous fungi. For the
cases in which no hits were generated in this way, the
translated nucleotide sequences of genes encoding the
specific enzymes (obtained from the (non-redundant)
NCBI nucleotides database [26]) were used as queries,
and BLASTX was employed for generating putative assignments.
Evaluation of functional assignments
Once candidate ORFs were identified for the metabolic
functions, the reliability of the functional assignments
was assessed and the ORFs were classified into different
categories, according to several criteria, as shown in Fig. 3
and Table 6, and described in the following.
Functional annotation (A)
Previous annotations of the candidate ORFs (if available
in the Aspergillus nidulans Database [5] or in The
Aspergillus nidulans Linkage Map [38]) were compared
with the function in question. The candidate ORFs were
classified into the categories A, A*, A-X or A-NA, depending on the availability and consistency of the results of the
comparison (see Fig. 3 and Table 6).
Protein families (F)
The protein domains originally predicted for the candidate ORFs [5] were compared with those of the enzymes
catalyzing the functions of interest [6], and the candidate
ORFs were classified accordingly into the categories F, F-X
or F-NA (see Fig. 3 and Table 6).
Comparative genomics with yeast (Y)
The proteins in S. cerevisiae [35] were used as queries in
BLASTP searches against all predicted proteins in A. nidulans [5], and the correspondences between ORFs in this
yeast and A. nidulans generated in this way were used to
evaluate the reliability of the candidate ORFs. This was
accomplished by comparing the functions assigned to the
ORFs in yeast with those assigned to the candidate ORFs.
The candidate ORFs were then classified into the following classes Y, Y*, Y-X or Y-NA (see Fig. 3 and Table 6).

O-X

Comparative genomics with other organisms (O)
Potential homologs of the candidate ORFs encoding the
metabolic functions in A. nidulans were surveyed in other
organisms, through BLASTP searches of the former against
the (non-redundant) protein database at NCBI [26]. The
corresponding functions were compared and the candidate ORFs were classified into the categories O, O*, O-X
or O-NA (see Fig. 3 and Table 6).
Isoenzymes, multifunctional enzymes and subunits in
enzyme complexes
The BLAST searches often yielded several hits (or candidate ORFs) with E-values lower than the cut-off value (or
with similar score-to-length ratios) for a given function.
These hits could potentially correspond to ORFs encoding
isoenzymes or subunits of enzyme complexes. In these situations, all candidate ORFs were considered and classified
according to the criteria described above. In some cases,
the existence of these hypothetical isoenzymes or subunits in A. nidulans was supported by information concerning this fungus available in the literature. Otherwise,

information was extrapolated from A. niger or S. cerevisiae.
Multi-enzyme complexes and isoenzymes were represented in a different way in the metabolic reconstruction.
All subunits considered to belong to a same multi-enzyme
complex were associated to a single reaction in the metabolic network, whereas isoenzymes were represented as
independent reactions. For example, in the metabolic network of A. nidulans, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex
is represented by two subunits (AN5162.2/AN9403.2),
which are associated to a single reaction (EC 1.2.4.1). On
the other hand, two isoenzymes of glutamate dehydrogenase (AN7451.2 and AN4376.2) were associated to two
different reactions in the metabolic network, a NAD+- and
a NADP+-dependent reaction, respectively. Reactions catalysed by multi-enzyme complexes were included, if at
least one of the subunits was identified.
Another issue that was addressed was related to the assignment of different functions to the same ORF. These ORFs

Page 13 of 15

could possibly encode multifunctional proteins, and
hence these were surveyed for the existence of multiple
protein domains to verify the hypotheses.

Metabolic model and simulation methods
The reconstructed metabolic network of A. nidulans,
including reactions encoded by previously annotated
genes as well as metabolic functions initially missing,
served as a basis to develop a stoichiometric model. The
model was subsequently used for simulating microbial
growth and for gene deletion analysis, by employing flux
balance analysis and linear programming methods
[21,43].

Application of the reconstructed metabolic network for
the analysis of transcription data
The reconstructed metabolic network was used in combination with a computational method published by Patil
and Nielsen [27] for analysis of large-scale gene expression data referring to a study on glucose repression in A.
nidulans. This method enables the identification of socalled reporter metabolites and metabolic subnetworks,
based on their interconnectedness within the metabolic
network through common metabolites and on information about changes in the expression level of the genes.

This approach was applied to analyze expression data
concerning a reference strain and a creA deleted strain of
A. nidulans, grown on different carbon sources, specifically glucose and ethanol [34]. Furthermore, the top 30
reporter metabolites identified based on the changes in
gene expression between the different carbon sources
(glucose versus ethanol) or genotype of the strains (reference versus creA deletion mutant) were used in combination with information on the topology of the metabolic
network of S. cerevisiae [22] for further analysis, using
tools available at the Saccharomyces Genome Database
[35].
