Abstract
Comparative modeling is becoming an increasingly helpful technique in microbial cell factories as
the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of a protein would be an invaluable aid to solve
problems on protein production. For this reason, an introduction to comparative modeling is
presented, with special emphasis on the basic concepts, opportunities and challenges of protein
structure prediction. This review is intended to serve as a guide for the biologist who has no special
expertise and who is not involved in the determination of protein structure. Selected applications
of comparative modeling in microbial cell factories are outlined, and the role of microbial cell
factories in the structural genomics initiative is discussed.

Review
Introduction
On the last two decades the development of recombinant
DNA techniques has extended the use of microbial organisms to produce target proteins. The enteric bacterium
Escherichia coli is one of the most extensively used prokaryotic organisms for genetic manipulations and for industrial production of proteins of therapeutic or commercial
interest [1,2]. However, bacterial organisms often fail to
produce target proteins due to problems related with protein misfolding and protein glycosilation. Yeast and fungal protein expression systems are used for the industrial
production of relevant enzymes in such cases [3].

There are two main interests in the industrial production
of proteins: i) Redefining the optimal properties of the target protein and ii) Avoiding problems of high-scale production. Knowledge of three-dimensional structure of the
proteins may be helpful to redesign a modified protein.
Computational prediction methods play an essential role

to provide us with structural information of a sequence
whose structure has not been experimentally determined.
Homology based or comparative modeling [4] is the most
detailed and accurate of all current protein structure prediction techniques [5]. Its aim is to build a three-dimensional model for a protein of unknown structure on the
basis of sequence similarity to proteins of known structure
[6]. Comparative modeling relies on the fact that structure
is more conserved than sequence during evolution. Therefore, similar sequences exhibit nearly identical structures,
and even distantly related sequences share the same fold
[7,8]. Comparative modeling critically depends on the
knowledge of three-dimensional structure of homologous
proteins. The progress of structural genomics initiatives
[9] allow to model a large amount of protein sequences.
Besides, the number of unique structural folds that proteins adopt is limited {Zhang, 1997; #81; Liu, 2004 #48}.
Consequently, it is likely that at least one example of most
structural folds will be known, making comparative modeling applicable to most protein sequences. In term, an

essential step of structural genomics is production of target proteins. Microbial cell factories play a key role in this
context.
This review is intended to give a primer addressed to scientists of disciplines related to microbial cell factories
who has no expertise in comparative modeling. Our goal
is to provide the seeding background to understand concepts, opportunities and challenges of comparative modeling. We will describe each step in the comparative
modeling process, discuss the most common errors and
how to solve them, as well as outlining the applications of
comparative modeling in the field of microbial cell
factories.
We will emphasize the simplest and most reliable methodologies to follow up along with their range of application with a reduced number of useful programs and web

servers. Many other authors have also written excellent
reviews on the comparative modeling field [6,10-14].
Steps in comparative modeling
All current comparative modeling methods consist of four
sequential steps: template selection, target-template alignment, model building and model evaluation. Essentially,
this is an iterative procedure until a satisfactory model is
obtained (Figure 1). In this process a variety of programs
and web servers can be used (Table 1). Additionally, protein modeling meta-servers are emerging. They automatically implement the full process in a multi-step protocol,
using simultaneously different methods [15].
Template selection
The starting point in comparative modelling is to identify
protein structures related to the target sequence and then
to select those that will be used as templates. Such temPage 2 of 11

plates may be found by sequence comparison methods or
by sequence-structure methods also known as threading
methods. Sequence comparison methods can be safely
used above a certain threshold in terms of sequence identity (i.e. percentage of identical paired residues in an alignment). It has been shown that above that threshold which is strongly dependent on sequence length,
sequence homology implies structural identity [16]. Even
though, below that threshold structural likeness is still
possible. Some protein pairs sharing very little sequence
similarity may have become similar by convergent or
divergent evolution. The alignment of these proteins
pairs, which define the so called "midnight zone" in
sequence alignment [17], is usually addressed with
threading methods. Finally, there is a range in terms of
sequence identity amid the safe zone and the "midnight
zone" in which the relationship between structural
homology and the phylogeny is unclear: the "twilight
zone" [18]. Within this range, which is usually defined
between 20 and 35% sequence identity [19], additional
caution must be taken on the sequence alignment.

that are appropriate for the given modelling problem. The
feasibility of a template can be assessed by means of its
expectation value, E-value [20], which is one of the
parameters in the searches outputs. As a general rule, the
lower the E-value, the better the template is.

PSI-BLAST [20], an iterative sequence comparison
method, is probably the most widely used program to
detect remote similarities. In more difficult scenarios,
where sequence homology is not so evident, templates
can be found by searching in sequence space using intermediate sequence search (ISS) methods [21-23].

3) Phylogenetic similarity. It is helpful to build a multiple
alignment and a phylogenetic tree [31] of the target and
templates, in order to select templates from the subfamily
that is closest to the target sequence. The phylogenetic tree
can be constructed by means of PHYLIP set of programs
[31].

Sequence comparisons can also be made through Hidden
Markov Models (HMMs) [24] as implemented, for
instance, in HMMER. HMMs profiles of protein domain
families are available in Pfam database. These profiles can
be used to automatically identify protein domain(s)
within the target even if it shares weak sequence similarity
with templates [25].

Depending on the purpose of the model, some of the factors listed above will be more important than others. For
instance, resolution of the template is probably the most
important factor if the reason for building the model is to
design mutants of a binding site, since an accurate geometrical description is needed.

Threading methods have been developed to find more
distant relationships. For this reason, they are the most
promising choice in the absence of homologues to the target sequence. Threading methods involve performing sensitive sequence searches and characterizing sequence
compatibility with the structural environments of putative templates. Features analysed by this kind of methods
include secondary structure and solvent accessibility predictions as well as functional annotation. Most used
methods of this kind are TOPITS [17], FUGUE [26],
Threader [27] and 3D-PSSM [28]. Recent examples of the
combined use of these servers and further modeling [29]
prove its use. Other methods are being developed based
on the analysis of protein-protein interactions to search
for remote similarities [30].
Once a list of related proteins with known structure has
been obtained, it is necessary to select those templates

Besides, several other factors should be considered when
selecting a template:
1) Quality of the experimental template structure. Because
errors in templates will be passed onto the models, the
better templates are the most accurate structures available.
Accuracy of the templates can be assessed by the resolution and the R-factor for a crystallographic structure, or by
the number of distance restraints per residue in the case of
NMR structure.
2) Environment likeness. Experimental factors of interest
for the target (i.e. the presence of a ligand in the structure,
pH, and solvent features ...) should be found as similar as
possible in the chosen templates.

It is important to emphasize that it is not mandatory to
select only one template. Actually, methods using multiple templates seems to perform better than those based on
a single template [14,32], especially if the main modes
extracted from them are taken into account [33]. Finally,
it is noteworthy to be aware that, implicitly, choosing
templates means the recognition of the target's overall
fold.
Target-template alignment
Once templates have been selected, an optimal alignment
between the target sequence and templates is needed to
further construct a three dimensional model of the target.

From easiest to more complex, some strategies for aligning target and templates are:
1) Obtaining a multiple alignment of the templates and
the target using CLUSTALW [34].

Page 4 of 11
(page number not for citation purposes)

Microbial Cell Factories 2005, 4:20

2) Aligning the query sequence to a HMM profile of the
templates family built from a Pfam alignment [25] using
HMMER [35].
3) Aligning the query sequence to a HMM profile of the
templates built from a structural alignment using
HMMER [35]. Structural alignments required for this
strategy can be obtained using STAMP [36] or CE [37]; an
automatic web server is available for the later one.
In our experience this third strategy, in which not only the
sequence similarity but also the structural information
inherent in the templates guide the alignment, make it
more trustworthy.
The obtained alignments must be critically evaluated in
terms of the number, length, and position of the gaps
opened. Some of them can be manually refined, taking
into account the secondary structure of the templates and
their accessible surface, both of them calculated with
DSSP program [38], in order to avoid gaps which are
opened within secondary structural elements. This will be
important if the alignment strategy is based only on
sequence similarity. In any case, at this step, if necessary,
the selection of templates may be revisited, either to
search a new template to overcome a gap in a particular
region or to remove redundant or inadequate templates.
Model building
Comparative model building generates an all-atom
model of the sequence based on its alignment to one or
more templates. It includes either sequential or simultaneous modelling of the core of the protein, loops, and
side-chains.

The original comparative approach, which is still widely
used, is modelling by rigid-body assembly [4]. This
method constructs the model from a few regions which
are obtained from dissecting related structures. In order to
assemble the dissected parts, a framework is calculated by
averaging of CÎ± atoms of structurally conserved regions in
template structures. Structurally variable regions are modeled by choosing from a database of all known proteins
those regions that better fit the anchor conserved regions.
COMPOSER [39] is one of the programs that use this
methodology in a semiautomated procedure. SwissModel
is a commonly used automated web server also based in
this approach [40-42].
Modeling by segment matching is another approach
which relies on the approximate positions of conserved
atoms in templates [27,43]. This is accomplished by
breaking the target into a set of short segments, and
searching in a database for matching fragments which are
fitted onto an initial framework of the target structure.

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/4/1/20

Database searching is based on sequence similarity, conformational similarity and compatibility with the target
structure. 3D-JIGSAW is one of the successful programs
that uses this approach [44]
Another approach is modeling by satisfaction of the spatial restrains obtained from the alignment [45]. Probably
the most used program based on this approach is MODELLER [46]. First, this automated procedure derives many
distance and dihedral angle restraints on the target
sequence from its alignment with template three-dimensional structures. Next, this homology-derived restraints
and energy terms ensuring proper stereochemistry are
combined into a function. Finally, the model is obtained
by optimizing this function in such a way that the model
violates the input restraints as little as possible. Several
slightly different models in agreement with the restraints
can be calculated.
Any of the three methods above described produce models of similar accuracy if they are optimally applied. In the
difficult cases, modeling by satisfaction of spatial
restraints is perhaps the most accurate technique, since it
can use many different types of information about the target sequence. In this way, available experimental data can
be added as new restraints, making the model more
reliable.
Loop modeling
Along with alignment, loop modeling is probably the
most difficult step in comparative modelling process.
Errors in loops are the dominant problem in comparative
modelling when target and template share above 35%
sequence identity. This is a very active area of research and
it is not practical to consider all available methods (details
of some of them can be found in [47-49]). In this review
we will present the state-of-the art of methods that can be
easily used. Furthermore, it must be pointed out that
although existing methods can provide reasonably accurate models of short loop regions; modeling of long loops
is still an unsolved problem [11]. Loop modeling methods can be classified in two approaches: ab initio methods
and database searching or knowledge-based methods.

Ab initio loop prediction is based on a conformational
search guided by a scoring or energy function -the later
describing the physico-chemical properties of a protein
and its environment. There are many such methods, making use of different protein representations, energy functions and optimisation procedures [11]. Among them,
there is an option to use implemented in MODELLER or
in a web server MODLOOP [50].
The database approach to loop prediction begins by finding segments of main chain that fit the two stems of a

Page 5 of 11
(page number not for citation purposes)

Microbial Cell Factories 2005, 4:20

loop. The stems are defined as the main chain atoms that
precede and follow the loop but are not part of it. The
search is performed through a database of many known
protein structures, not only homologues of the modeled
protein. Usually, many different hits are obtained and
possibly sorted according different criteria (geometric or
sequence similarity). The selected segments are then
superposed and annealed onto the stem regions. These
initial crude models are often refined by optimisation of
some energy function. Databases searching approach is
more accurate and efficient if it is precedent by an structural classification of the loops present in the database.
Web-servers based on structural classification [51,52] are
available (see table 1). When database searching is used,
it must be keep on mind that the bigger the length of the
loop, the lesser the number of putative solutions that will
be in the database. At the present, this fact makes this
approach specially useful for loops up to 7 residues long
[53].
Finally, it must be remarked that prediction of a loop conformation is hindered by two main factors: i) the exponential increase of number of possible conformations as
the length of the loop grows, and ii) the conformation of
a loop is influenced by the core stem regions that span the
loop as well as by the structure of rest of the protein that
encircles the loop. These two factors make loop modeling
one of the most difficult tasks of the comparative modeling process.
Sidechain modeling
Similarly to what happens in loop modeling, sidechain
conformation can be predicted from knowledge-based
approaches or taking into account steric or energetic considerations [54].

Knowledge-based approaches, which are the most widely
used, employ libraries of common rotamers extracted
from high resolution X-ray structures. Rotamers are tried
successively and scored with a variety of energy functions
[13]. This approach is implemented in most automatic
homology modeling procedures. Among the available
software to do so it is worth mentioning: the CORALL
module of WHATIF [55] and the SCWRL program [56].
Several works have probed the biological relevance of
side-chain modeling, as they may imply behavioural
changes in protein-protein interactions and dimerization
[57-59].
Errors in comparative models
Structural models obtained by homology will have
regions that resemble the true structure and regions that
do not. That is, all models contain a certain amount of
errors, which are more frequent as sequence identity
decreases. Any stage of the comparative modeling process

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/4/1/20

has its own source of errors; accordingly, they can be
divided in five categories [6]:
1) Incorrect templates. This is a problem when templates
share less than 25% sequence identity with the target.
2) Missalignments errors. Accuracy of the alignments is
still the key limitation on the quality and usefulness of the
models, being the optimal placement of gaps its limiting
factor [60]. If the target and the templates have over 40%
sequence identity, the alignment is almost always correct.
As percentage of identity decreases, regions of local low
sequence similarity appear, and alignment errors are more
feasible to occur. Alignment errors increase rapidly below
30% sequence identity and become the major source of
errors in this kind of models [11,14]. Target-template
alignment is probably the most crucial step in comparative modelling, since any errors at this step are usually
impossible to correct later [47]. Therefore, it is indeed
important to devote efforts to attain the most precise
alignment.
3) Structural distortions in correctly aligned regions. As
sequence identity decreases, it is possible that a segment
correctly aligned adopts different local structure than the
target, without disruption of the overall fold. It is convenient to use multiple templates whenever they are available
to overcome this problem [61].
4) Errors in regions without a template. Insertions are the
most challenging regions to model, because there is not a
equivalent region in the template. The complexity of the
problem increases with the length of the segment. Database searching [62] or energy-based methods [63] can be
applied to predict the conformation of the insertion. If
there are alignment errors at stem residues or at the other
environment residues, insertion modeling is not likely to
result in an accurate model [49]. Therefore, the most accurate environment surrounding the insertion, the better
results are obtained.
5) Errors in sidechain packing. As sequence identity
decreases below 30%, there is a rapid decrease in the conservation of sidechain packing. That is, rotamers of identical residues are not conserved because the overall
surroundings are changed. In addition, it must be pointed
out that the correct prediction of sidechain conformation
is hampered by the coupling between mainchain and
sidechains and by the continuous nature of the distribution of dihedral angles [54]. This kind of error can be critical if affecting residues implicated in protein function. As
we will see later, a refinement of the structure by energy
minimization or molecular dynamics can sometimes surmount this problem [64].

Microbial Cell Factories 2005, 4:20

Summarising, consequences of the errors are more serious
if they are made in the initial steps of the comparative
modeling process: if the selection of the template is
wrong, the model based on it will be wrong; if the alignment is incorrect, local features of the model will be incorrect. Remaining errors are mainly due to incorrect
description of the environment of a particular region of
the structure.
Evaluation of the models
The quality of the obtained model establish the limits of
the information than can be safely extracted from it.
Although all structural models obtained by enclose mistakes, they become less of a problem when it is possible to
detect them. Once an error is identified, it is possible to
discriminate whether it affects key structural or functional
regions. Accordingly, strategies to surmount errors should
be taken in consideration. Therefore, an essential step in
the comparative modeling process is the detection of
wrongly modelled regions.

There are two different approaches to estimate errors in a
structure: 1) checking the consistency of the model with
experimental data of the target protein, and 2) evaluating
stereochemistry and other spatial features of the model by
means of methods based on statistics derived from experimentally determined protein structures.
On the first approach experimental data is used to certainly determine if particular regions of the protein are
correctly modeled. Biochemical data of the most important residues regarding protein overall structure and function can be used to validate the model [65,66]. That is,
they should be in close proximity in 3D space and in the
correct orientation to perform their role. A consistent
modeling of such residues does not ensure a good prediction; conversely, inconsistency is a important reason for
concern.
One essential requisite for a model is to have a good stereochemistry. Programs used to check the stereochemistry
are based in the analysis of datasets of experimentally
determined protein structures. With this respect, the most
widely used program is PROCHECK [67], which provide
an assessment of the overall quality of the structure and
highlight regions that may need further investigation.
Besides stereochemistry, there are other spatial features in
the proteins, that could be used as indicators of errors in
the models: packing, creation of a hydrophobic core, residue and atomic solvent accessibilities, spatial distribution
of charged groups, distribution of atom-atom distances
and main-chain hydrogen bonding structures [47]. This
kind of information is exploited in another group of programs based on the use of energetic profiles introduced by

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/4/1/20

statistical criteria [68,69]. PROSAII [70] is probably the
most widely used program of this category. Although
there is a concern about the theoretical validity of the
energy profiles for detecting local error in models [6], this
approach have been successfully applied [71,72].
It is important to note here that it is highly recommended
to analyse the experimentally determined structure of
templates with PROCHECK and PROSA II programs. This
should allow to discriminate between errors coming from
the model and errors already present in the templates.
As a final step, energy minimization and/or molecular
dynamics simulations [73] of the model can be done to
minimize errors detected with PROCHECK and PROSA II.
The most common used programs for this purpose are
GROMOS [74], CHARMM [75] and AMBER [76], which
explore and evaluate the multiple possible conformations
of the protein.
Performing this step is still a controversial issue [77],
because the description of the physico-chemical properties of the protein and its environment is not accurate
enough [11]. Even though, new evidences are suggesting
that long molecular dynamics simulations with explicit
solvent could overcome errors in comparative modeling
[64]. Over more, strategies focusing on the appropriate
sampling of biologically relevant conformations of the
protein have been proved to be useful refining the model.
This can be achieved by restraining the movement of specific aminoacids [78] or to particular directions in the
space [33].
Comparative modeling applications in the field of
microbial cell factories
On structure-function relationships
Besides other general applications of protein comparative
modeling [6], there are two of them which can be of particular interest in microbial cell factories:

1) Proposing residues for site-directed mutagenesis experiments in target proteins to assess its biological function.
There are many examples of how comparative modeling
has been used to propose mutants, dealing with different
structural features of the protein, such as electrostatic
charge and surface shape [79], loop flexibility and residue
accessibility [80], the protein binding or enzyme active
site [81] or an enzyme alosteric site [82], among others. It
is not prudent to apply comparative modeling for this
purpose if the target and templates do not share at least
around 30% sequence identity, since the required degree
of resolution of the model will be not enough to describe
the affected structural features on the target protein [6].

Page 7 of 11

Microbial Cell Factories 2005, 4:20

2) Detecting an functional important regions of a protein.
The knowledge achieved in the process must allow to
design proteins with altered or improved functionality.
The location of a binding site can be identified by localizing clusters of charged residues [83,84] or using data of
deleterious mutations [82] Biological important regions
tend to be predicted better than other parts of the model
[14], because amino acids in the active and binding sites
are often more conserved than other structural features in
a protein [85]. In addition, activity is mostly based on the
physicochemical properties of residues and its spatial orientation [86]. Consequently, the degree of sequence similarity shared by the target and the templates is less
restrictive for this particular application, and thus homology modeling can be applied in a wide range of scenarios,
including when sequence similarity drops below 30%.
On solving protein production related problems
There are other topics in protein production processes by
means of cell factories in which structural-related features
play a major role. One example is protein aggregation
leading to bacterial inclusion bodies, which constitute a
major bottleneck in protein production [87]. Recently, it
has been shown that aggregation depends on specific
interactions between solvent-exposed hydrophobic
stretches which adopt the form of Î²-sheet structures [88].
This structural knowledge provides some insight on how
to solve this problem: such interactions should be specifically disrupted to avoid aggregation of Î²-sheets. However, full understanding of this phenomena requires also
comprehending the structural details on how two or more
proteins interacts. This constitutes a challenging problem
known as protein-protein docking prediction [89,90].
Recent works suggest that comparative modeling can be
still helpful in combination with other experimental techniques to adress this problem [91,92].
On the meeting point of comparative modeling and cell
microbial factories: structural genomics
A major necessity of medium- to high-scale protein production has recently arose with the development of initiatives on structural genomics [93,94]. These initiatives,
which pursue to elucidate the tree-dimensional structures
of all proteins [95,96], demand optimized and further
robotized protein expression systems [87]. This aim will
be achieved by a focused, large-scale determination of
protein structures by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, combined efficiently with accurate protein
structure modeling techniques [6].

Structural genomics, as a first step, involves ensuring that
each family of proteins is represented by a known structure, avoiding unworthy efforts that will result in redundant structural information. It must be pointed out that,
nowadays, there are still families of proteins which must

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/4/1/20

be excluded for this kind of large-scale studies. These
problematic cases include integral membrane proteins,
highly disulfide-bridge proteins and large complexes [87].
All projects employ exhaustively computational methods
for target selection and family exclusion [97]. For the rest
of proteins, three-dimensional models can be inferred
from the previously resolved family representatives. As a
result, a huge amount of structural data will be available,
which in turn can serve as starting point for a rational protein production design.
A complete success of the structural genomics initiative
critically depends on the advances in protein production
technologies. This includes new approaches in expression
of targets that show challenges on protein folding [87]
and also in the development of automated or semi-automated methods, robust and inexpensive for protein purification [96].

Conclusion
We have attempted to establish the capabilities and limitations of current methods of comparative modeling, as
well as a general strategy to follow up in a practical case,
that hopefully could serve as a guide for biologist in this
field. This methods are becoming important as tools for
scientists working in microbial cell factories. We have
shown in this review few examples where the use of comparative modeling have been used in this area.
Comparative modeling can be safely used when target and
templates share at least 30% sequence identity. Below this
threshold, modeling becomes a difficult task even for
experts. In any case, models must be critically evaluated to
be sure that they are correct enough, devoting most of
efforts to the region involved in function.
Many challenging aspects of comparative modeling are
active areas of research. The state-of-the-art of the protein
structure prediction strategies and methodologies is tested
every two years in the CASP (Critically Assessment of techniques for protein Structure Prediction) meeting. A carefully reading of the proceedings of the meeting is probably
the best way to update the progress made by the field. See
supplement 6 of volume 53 of Proteins for the last report
available [98].
As a final advice, it is a good policy make use of different
strategies to build the model and compare them. This is
always pertinent but specially as sequence identity
decreases. Consistency between different models does not
ensure a good prediction; however, inconsistency is a
meaningful cause of concern.
With the help of structural genomics, the structure of at
least one member of the most globular folds will be deter-

mined in the next years, making comparative modeling
more easy. However, this is not already true for membrane proteins, which constitute a more difficult scenario
[99], and more improvements in both structure determination and modeling techniques are needed.
Finally, we do believe that comparative modeling should
play key role in the microbial cell factories. It will help
biologists to choose which are the most interesting
mutant proteins to produce, to design new proteins with
a desired function, or to modify a protein to avoid production-related problems.

List of abbreviations
Target: protein to be modelled. Templates: set of proteins,
homologous to the target, for which three-dimensional
structure is known. Model: inferred three-dimensional
structure of the target. NMR: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.
HMM: Hidden Markov Model. Structural alignment:
sequence alignment based on structural similarities. CÎ± :
Alpha-carbon; carbon atom joining the carboxyl group
and the amino group in an amino acid. Restraint: as
referred to in this paper, a restraint is a reduction of the
conformational space of a protein on account of a prior
knowledge. Main chain: sequence of atoms within a protein formed by the carboxyl group, the alpha-carbon and
the amino group of each of its amino acids. Side-Chain:
atoms of an amino acid not belonging to the main chain.
