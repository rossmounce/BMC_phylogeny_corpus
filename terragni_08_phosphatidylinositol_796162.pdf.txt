Abstract
Background: Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase is activated by a variety of growth factor receptors and the PI 3kinase/Akt signaling pathway is a key regulator of cell proliferation and survival. The downstream targets of PI 3kinase/Akt signaling include direct regulators of cell cycle progression and apoptosis as well as a number of
transcription factors. Growth factor stimulation of quiescent cells leads to robust activation of PI 3-kinase,
induction of immediate-early genes, and re-entry into the cell cycle. A lower level of PI 3-kinase signaling is also
required for the proliferation and survival of cells maintained in the presence of growth factors, but the gene
expression program controlled by PI 3-kinase signaling in proliferating cells has not been elucidated.
Results: We used microarray analyses to characterize the changes in gene expression resulting from inhibition
of PI 3-kinase in proliferating cells. The genes regulated by inhibition of PI 3-kinase in proliferating cells were
distinct from genes induced by growth factor stimulation of quiescent cells and highly enriched in genes that
regulate programmed cell death. Computational analyses followed by chromatin immunoprecipitations
demonstrated FOXO binding to both previously known and novel sites in promoter regions of approximately
one-third of the up-regulated genes, consistent with activation of FOXO1 and FOXO3a in response to inhibition
of PI 3-kinase. NFB binding sites were similarly identified in promoter regions of over one-third of the downregulated genes. RelB was constitutively bound to promoter regions in cells maintained in serum, however binding
decreased following PI 3-kinase inhibition, indicating that PI 3-kinase signaling activates NFB via the non-canonical
pathway in proliferating cells. Approximately 70% of the genes targeted by FOXO and NFB regulate cell
proliferation and apoptosis, including several regulators of apoptosis that were not previously known to be
targeted by these transcription factors.
Conclusion: PI 3-kinase signaling in proliferating cells regulates a novel transcriptional program that is highly
enriched in genes that regulate apoptosis. At least one-third of these genes are regulated either by FOXO
transcription factors, which are activated following PI 3-kinase inhibition, or by RelB, which is activated by PI 3kinase via the non-canonical pathway in proliferating cells.

Background
The PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway plays a critical role
in the regulation of growth factor-dependent metabolism,
proliferation and survival of mammalian cells [1,2]. The
downstream targets of Akt that function to regulate cell
proliferation and survival include the Bcl-2 family member Bad [3,4] and the pro-apoptotic protein kinase GSK-3
[5,6], both of which are inhibited by Akt phosphorylation. Targets of GSK-3 that have been implicated in cell
proliferation and survival include the Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 [7], cyclin D1 [8], and the translation initiation
factor eIF2B [9]. In addition, both Akt and GSK-3 phosphorylate a variety of transcription factors [10-13], and
transcriptional regulation plays an important role in the
control of cell growth and survival by PI 3-kinase/Akt/
GSK-3 signaling. For example, the FOXO transcription
factors are well-characterized substrates of Akt with key
roles in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Phosphorylation
by Akt leads to the retention of FOXOs in the cytoplasm
as a result of binding to 14-3-3 proteins [14,15]. In the
absence of PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling, FOXOs translocate
to the nucleus and activate transcription of their target
genes, including those that encode proteins that induce
cell cycle arrest (e.g., p130, p27 and cyclin G2) and apoptosis (e.g., Fas ligand, Trail, and Bim) [16]. Additional
transcription factors that are regulated either directly or
indirectly by Akt and/or GSK-3 and may be involved in
control of PI 3-kinase-dependent cell proliferation and
survival include p53 [17], YAP [18], NFB [19,20], CREB
[21,22], c-Myc [23,24], and c-Jun [25].
Although studies of individual transcription factors and
their target genes have elucidated several aspects of PI 3kinase signaling, understanding the overall program of
transcriptional regulation controlled by the PI 3-kinase/
Akt/GSK-3 pathway requires global expression analysis.
We and others have previously used global expression
profiling to identify genes whose induction is dependent
on PI 3-kinase signaling following growth factor stimulation of quiescent cells [26-29]. Computational analysis to
identify transcription factor binding sites that were overrepresented in upstream regions of the PI 3-kinase
dependent genes further implicated FOXO, NFB and
CREB as regulators of the induction of these genes in
response to growth factor stimulation [26]. Additional
studies have identified a subset of these PI 3-kinase-regulated genes that are controlled by GSK-3 and have shown
that inhibition of CREB by GSK-3 plays a key role in
repressing PI 3-kinase-dependent gene expression in quiescent cells [30].
These studies of transcriptional regulation downstream of
PI 3-kinase have examined gene expression in quiescent
cells that have been acutely stimulated by growth factor,
leading to the robust activation of PI 3-kinase signaling,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/9/6

the rapid induction of immediate-early genes, and the
proliferation of cells arrested in G0. A lower level of PI 3kinase signaling is also required for the survival and proliferation of cells that are normally maintained in the
presence of growth factors [31]. In the present study, we
have examined the gene expression changes that result
from inhibition of PI 3-kinase in cells that are actively proliferating in the presence of serum. These experiments
identified a novel program of PI 3-kinase-regulated gene
expression that is highly enriched in genes that function as
regulators of apoptosis and distinct from the program of
gene expression induced by growth factor stimulation of
quiescent cells. Combined computational and experimental analyses further demonstrated that FOXO and NFB
are major regulators of genes controlled by PI 3-kinase in
proliferating cells, and identified new genes with important roles in apoptosis that are targeted by these transcription factors.

Results
Identification of Genes Regulated by PI 3-kinase Signaling
in Proliferating Cells
Global expression changes were analyzed in actively proliferating T98G human glioblastoma cells, which are
widely used as a model for studies of growth factor regulation of human cells [26,32,33]. Similar to previous studies in rat fibroblasts [31], these cells maintained a low
level of PI 3-kinase signaling, which was 7 fold higher
than in quiescent cells but approximately 5-fold lower
than that observed following mitogenic stimulation of
quiescent cells with either platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF) or 20% serum (Fig. 1A). PI 3-kinase was rapidly
inhibited in proliferating cells by addition of LY294002
[34], which inhibited phosphorylation of Akt within 15
minutes (Fig. 1B). Inhibition of PI 3-kinase led to the
induction of apoptosis, which initiated as early as 3 hours
after addition of LY294002 as indicated by DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1C). The fraction of cells undergoing apoptosis gradually increased over several hours (Fig. 1D),
typically reaching levels of 25–50% after 24 hours of PI 3kinase inhibition.

Microarray analyses were performed in three independent
experiments to characterize the changes in gene expression resulting from PI 3-kinase inhibition. The number of
genes with significantly altered expression (Log2 > 0.9; p <
0.01) after 2, 4 and 8 hours of treatment with LY294002
are shown in Fig. 2. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase for 2 hours
resulted in the up-regulation of 20 genes and down-regulation of 26 genes. After 4 hours of PI 3-kinase inhibition,
the number of up-regulated genes slightly increased to a
total of 23, whereas the number of down-regulated genes
nearly doubled, to a total of 44. The increase in the
number of down-regulated genes was most likely due to
the slower rates of mRNA degradation for some genes,

Effect of1 3-kinase inhibition on T98G cells
Effect of PI 3-kinase inhibition on T98G cells. A, Cell extracts were harvested from starved T98G cells that were rendered quiescent by 72 hours of incubation in serum-free medium, from actively proliferating T98G cells in serum-containing
medium, and from quiescent cells that had been stimulated by treatment with 20% serum or PDGF for 30 minutes. Extracts
were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phospho Akt and pan anti-Akt antibodies. B, Actively proliferating
T98G cells in serum-containing media were treated with either 50 M LY294002 or 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control, 0 minute
timepoint). Cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting. C, Proliferating T98G cells were treated with LY294002 for the
indicated times. Cytosolic nucleic acids were isolated and DNA fragmentation was assessed by gel electrophoresis. D, Proliferating T98G cells were harvested at the indicated times after LY294002 treatment, subjected to TUNEL assay, and TUNEL-positive cells quantified by flow cytometry.
thus requiring a longer period for significant decreases in
mRNA levels to occur. After 8 hours of PI 3-kinase inhibition, the numbers of both up-regulated and down-regulated genes increased substantially to 118 and 121,
respectively, possibly resulting from secondary changes in
gene expression.
The genes that were up- or down-regulated following 2
and 4 hours of PI 3-kinase inhibition are summarized in
Table 1 (see Additional file 1 for expression changes and

for genes with altered expression at 8 hours). Most of the
up-regulated genes had increased levels of mRNA after
both 2 and 4 hours of inhibition, however 4 genes were
significantly up-regulated at 2 hours but returned to baseline at 4 hours, perhaps reflecting transient gene induction. Most down-regulated genes displayed reduced
mRNA levels at both 2 and 4 hours, generally decreasing
at the longer time of PI 3-kinase inhibition. The microarray data for 7 up-regulated and 11 down-regulated genes
were validated by real-time RT-PCR. For all genes tested,

changes in expression of 7 out of 12 genes in response to
PI 3-kinase inhibition were similar in both U937 and
T98G cells, and 3 other genes were either up- or down-regulated, although to different extents, in both cell lines.

or 8 hours. Microarray analyses at each timepoint were performed on 3 independent cultures compared to untreated
controls. Data are presented as the number of genes that

the expression changes assessed by real-time RT-PCR after
4 hours of PI 3-kinase inhibition confirmed the microarray results (Additional file 1).
Since LY294002 can also inhibit PI 3-kinase-related protein kinases, such as mTOR, we also tested the effect of
wortmannin, a more selective PI 3-kinase inhibitor that
does not inhibit mTOR at the concentration used (50 nM)
[35]. 15 of the 18 genes were similarly up or down-regulated by both wortmannin and LY294002 (Additional file
2), indicating that PI 3-kinase was responsible for the
changes in expression of these genes. It is possible that the
3 genes whose expression was affected by LY294002 but
not wortmannin may be regulated by other targets of
LY294002. However 50 nM wortmannin was less effective
than LY294002 in inhibiting PI 3-kinase, yielding approximately 90% rather than complete inhibition of Akt phosphorylation (Additional file 2), so it is also possible that
the 10% of PI 3-kinase signaling remaining after wortmannin treatment was sufficient to maintain normal
expression of some genes. In either case, these results support the involvement of PI 3-kinase signaling in the regulation of at least 80–90% of the genes showing altered
expression in response to LY294002.
To determine whether gene expression was similarly regulated in a different cell line, the response of representative
genes to inhibition of PI 3-kinase was tested in U937
human promyelocytic leukemia cells (Table 2). The

Functions of PI 3-kinase-regulated Genes
The genes that showed changes in expression after 2 and
4 hours of PI 3-kinase inhibition were largely overlapping
and therefore were combined for subsequent analyses.
This yielded a gene set in which altered expression was
detected around the onset of apoptosis. These genes were
compared to a group of 34 immediate-early genes that
were induced by PI 3-kinase signaling following PDGF
stimulation of quiescent T98G cells [26]. There were only
4 genes in common between the two groups (CTGF,
PLAU, CCL2 and F3), indicating that >90% of the genes
regulated by continual PI 3-kinase signaling were distinct
from immediate-early genes induced by PI 3-kinase in
response to acute growth factor stimulation.

The genes with altered expression in response to inhibition of PI 3-kinase in T98G cells for 2 and 4 hours
included well-known regulators of apoptosis and cell
cycle progression. The ability of PI 3-kinase inhibition to
induce apoptosis was apparent in the up-regulation of
genes that can promote cell death, including DDIT3/
CHOP [36], GADD45B [37], and PHLDA1 [38], and the
down-regulation of genes that promote cell survival,
including BIRC3/cIAP2 [39] and TNFRSF11B/osteoprotegerin [40]. Additional expression changes included the upregulation of genes that inhibit cell cycle progression,
such as CCNG2 [41], BTG1 [42] and GADD45B [43], as
well as the down-regulation of CCND1. Genes encoding
several growth factors and cytokines that promote cell
proliferation and survival (including FGF2, NTF3, EDN1,
CCL2 and BDNF) were also down-regulated following
inhibition of PI 3-kinase.
The Gene Ontology (GO) database was used to further
characterize the functions of the genes regulated by PI 3kinase. The frequencies of the GO terms assigned to the PI
3-kinase-regulated set of genes were compared to the frequencies of all annotated genes on the microarray. Biological Process GO terms that were significantly enriched (p <
0.001) and identified in at least 15% of the GO-annotated
genes that were either up- or down-regulated following 2
and 4 hours of inhibition of PI 3-kinase are indicated in
Table 3. The larger set of genes with altered expression
after 8 hours of PI 3-kinase inhibition did not display
enrichment of GO terms at this level of statistical significance. The up-regulated genes were enriched in GO categories related to development, differentiation, and
response to stress, as well as in GO terms related to transcriptional regulation. These GO categories, particularly
"response to stress", include such genes as DDIT3/CHOP

[36] and GADD45B [37], and are consistent with the
increased expression of genes involved in apoptosis and
cell cycle arrest following inhibition of PI 3-kinase. The
down-regulated genes were enriched in GO terms related
to cell signaling and programmed cell death, consistent
with the role of PI 3-kinase signaling in preventing apoptosis. These included genes encoding growth factors and
cytokines as well as central negative regulators of apoptosis, such as BIRC3/cIAP2 [39] and the TRAIL decoy receptor, TNFRSF11B/osteoprotogerin [40].
Prediction of Transcription Factor Binding Sites in PI 3Kinase Regulated Genes
Co-expressed genes are often regulated by common transcription factors, therefore we analyzed the upstream
regions of different sets of PI 3-kinase-regulated genes to
identify over-represented transcription factor binding
sites [26,30,44]. Predictions of functional transcription
factor binding sites can be improved by incorporating
phylogenetic data to identify sites that are evolutionarily
conserved [45], so we focused on sites that were conserved
in orthologous genomic regions of human and mouse.
We independently analyzed the sets of genes that were
either up- or down-regulated following PI 3-kinase inhibition, and also separately analyzed the genes that showed
altered expression after 2 and 4 hours of PI 3-kinase inhibition and those that showed altered expression after 8
hours of PI 3-kinase inhibition. Regions 3 kb upstream of
the transcription start sites in the human and correspond-

ing mouse sequences were analyzed with the Match program using the minSUM threshold, and both the 546
vertebrate matrices in TRANSFAC Professional v8.4 and
the 588 matrices in TRANSFAC Professional v11.1. Overrepresentation of transcription factor binding sites was
assessed by comparing the frequency of predicted sites in
each set of genes to the frequencies in a background set of
genes that were expressed in proliferating T98G cells but
not affected by PI 3-kinase inhibition (see Additional file
3 for complete results).
No significantly over-represented binding sites were identified in the sets of genes that were either up- or down-regulated following 8 hours of PI 3-kinase inhibition,
perhaps because these large sets of genes are regulated by
a diverse group of transcription factors or by other mechanisms, such as mRNA degradation. However, over-represented binding site matrices were identified in the sets of
genes that were either up- or down-regulated after 2 and 4
hours of PI 3-kinase inhibition.
When the results from TRANSFAC v8.4 and v11.1 were
combined, there were 9 matrices that were significantly
over-represented in the up-regulated genes (Table 4).
These included matrices for the forkhead family of transcription factors, as well as for Myc/Max and NF-Y. The
most significant matrices represented forkhead family
proteins, which together predicted binding sites in 82% of
the up-regulated genes. The down-regulated genes were
enriched in 4 matrices, 2 for NFB and 2 for HMGI(Y).
When the results from TRANSFAC v8.4 and v11.1 were
combined, 27% of the genes had at least one NFB binding site. The clear enrichment of forkhead and NFB binding sites in the up- and down-regulated genes,
respectively, as well as the fact that members of both of
these families of transcription factors are known targets of
Akt, led us to further investigate the roles of forkhead and
NFB in the transcriptional response of genes regulated by
inhibition of PI 3-kinase.
Analysis of FOXO Regulation and Target Genes
The FOXO transcription factors are inhibited by Akt phosphorylation of Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319 on FOXO1
and the equivalent sites on FOXO3 and FOXO4 [16].
Phosphorylation of these residues results in the binding
of 14-3-3 proteins, which inhibits nuclear shuttling and
transcriptional activity of the FOXOs. We investigated the
expression of FOXO transcription factors in T98G cells
and their response to PI 3-kinase inhibition by subcellular
fractionation and immunoblotting (Fig. 3). FOXO1 and
FOXO3a were expressed in T98G cells and were principally localized to the cytoplasm in cells maintained in
serum (FOXO4 was not detectable, data not shown).
Addition of LY294002 resulted in the nuclear accumulation of both FOXO1 and FOXO3a within 30 minutes,

consistent with their involvement in the transcriptional
response of T98G cells to PI 3-kinase inhibition.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were
therefore used to test the predicted FOXO binding sites in
genes that were induced upon PI 3-kinase inhibition.
Exponentially growing T98G cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing a Flag-tagged FOXO3aAAA mutant [46] and immunoprecipitations of sheared
chromatin were performed with Flag-antibody. The FlagFOXO3a-AAA is a constitutively active mutant in which
the three Akt phosphorylation sites have been mutated to
alanines, resulting in its constitutive nuclear localization.
ChIP assays were performed on three independent transfected cell cultures to test predicted FOXO binding sites
upstream of 21 up-regulated genes (two open reading
frames with predicted FOXO binding sites were not tested,
C1orf63 and C1orf183, due to their hypothetical protein
designation). Flag-FOXO3a-AAA specifically bound to
upstream regions of 10 of these 21 genes, compared to
cells transfected with empty vector or to the negative control gene -globin (Fig. 4). These verified FOXO binding
sites are indicated in Table 5 (see Additional file 4 for all
sites tested). These 10 genes included 4 with previously

established FOXO upstream binding sites [CCNG2
[46,47], BTG1 [48], BCL-6 [49,50] and ATROGIN-1 [51]
as well as 6 genes not previously identified as having binding sites for FOXO (ZBTB1, KIF1B, KLF6, KLHL24, DDIT3/
CHOP and TXNIP).
Analysis of NFB Regulation and Target Genes
In contrast to the forkhead family, Akt indirectly activates
NFB transcription factors, at least in part by phosphorylation of IB kinase (IKK) [19,20]. There are 5 different
NFB family members (p65, c-Rel, RelB, p50 and p52),
which all bind to a similar consensus sequence and can be
activated by several pathways that converge on IKK [52].
Because the majority of NFB binding sites are occupied
after stimulation with cytokines [53], we initially performed ChIP assays following treatment of T98G cells
with tumor necrosis factor  (TNF) to determine if p65
was able to bind to the sites predicted in the genes that
were down-regulated upon PI 3-kinase inhibition. In
addition to the sites predicted by the matrices indicated in
Table 4, we tested conserved sites predicted by 7 additional NFB matrices to ensure that most functional binding sites were identified. When all matrices were
considered, 25 NFB sites were predicted in a total of 20

The 3 kb regions upstream of the transcription start sites in the human and mouse orthologous sequences were analyzed with the Match algorithm
using the MinSUM threshold and both TRANSFAC v8.4 and v11.1 in order to identify over-represented matrices. P-values were calculated using the

TNF activates NFB through the canonical pathway, in
which IKK phosphorylates IB, which predominantly
serves to activate the p50–p65 NFB heterodimer. Cells
treated with TNF for 0.25, 0.5 or 1 hour were therefore
analyzed by ChIP using anti-p65 antibody. Of the 25 predicted sites, 22 sites in 18 genes exhibited increased p65
binding in response to TNF, which was significantly
greater than binding to the -globin negative control (Fig.
5). The binding sites (Table 6) included several that were
previously known [BIRC3/cIAP2 [54], CCL2 [55], CCND1
[56], EDN1 site I [57], F3 site II [58], GABPB2 [53], IL7R
site II [59], MAT2A site II [60], PLAU [61] and PTX3 [62],
in addition to novel binding sites in genes known to be
targeted by NFB [BDNF [63], EDN1 site II, F3 site I, IL7R
site I and MAT2A site I], as well as binding sites in novel
NFB-regulated genes (AMIGO2, FST, G0S2, IGFBP5,
RGS20, STC2 and TNFRSF11B/osteoprotegerin). Note that
some of these verified NFB binding sites were predicted
with either Transfac v8.4 or v11.1, but not both.

Analysis 4 FOXO binding sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation
Analysis of FOXO binding sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation. T98G cells were transfected with an empty
pcDNA3 control or Flag-FOXO3a-AAA expression vector for 24 hours. Chromatin fragments were immunoprecipitated with
anti-Flag antibody and quantified by real-time PCR (see Additional file 4 for primers). Data are presented as percentage of input
and are the means of 3 independent transfections ± S.E -globin is a negative control. Immunoblots indicated that the expression of FOXO3a-AAA in transfected cells was 3–5 fold greater than the endogenous protein.

p65 did not show increased binding to any of the predicted sites in the absence of TNF stimulation as compared to the -globin control (Fig. 5), which was expected
due to its sequestration in the cytoplasm by IB proteins.
However, other members of the NFB family can be
found in the nucleus of proliferating cells in the absence
of cytokine stimulation. p50 and p52 do not bind IB
proteins but rather enter the nucleus following their generation from cleavage of larger precursors (p105 and
p100, respectively). Both p50 and p52 lack activation
domains, but p52-RelB heterodimers are also able to
translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription of
their target genes. In the non-canonical pathway of NFB
activation, IKK phosphorylation of p100 results in its
conversion to p52, which forms a transcriptionally active
complex with RelB [52]. Since the non-canonical pathway
is stimulated by Akt and can be active in the absence of
cytokine stimulation [64], it might be responsible for
NFB activity in cells proliferating in serum growth factors.
We therefore performed ChIP assays to measure the basal
levels of binding of several NFB family members to the
predicted NFB binding sites in proliferating cells in the
presence of serum. As was observed for p65 (see Fig. 5), cRel, which is also activated by the canonical pathway, did

not bind to upstream regions of any of the genes (data not
shown). In contrast, p50, p52 and RelB bound to the predicted sites in several genes, most strikingly PTX3 and
BIRC3/cIAP2 (Fig. 6). RelB ChIP assays were performed on
three independent cultures so that a statistical comparison
could be made between the genes with predicted sites and
the -globin negative control. This analysis indicated significant binding (p < 0.05) of RelB to NFB sites upstream
of 7 genes in T98G cells maintained in serum, including
known NFB sites upstream of BIRC3/cIAP2, CCL2,
CCND1, GABPB2, MAT2A (site II), PLAU and PTX3, and a
novel site in MAT2A (site I).
Because RelB has a transactivation domain and the predicted sites occurred upstream of genes that were downregulated in response to PI 3-kinase inhibition, we next
sought to determine if RelB binding decreased in cells that
were treated with LY294002 to inhibit PI 3-kinase. ChIP
assays were performed in triplicate to measure RelB binding to the confirmed binding sites in the 7 genes mentioned previously (Fig. 7). Inhibition of PI 3-kinase led to
a significant decrease in RelB binding (p < 0.05) to the
sites in BIRC3, CCL2 and PTX3, consistent with PI 3kinase regulation of these genes through the non-canonical NFB pathway.

overlapping sites, the position indicates the most 5' nucleotide of the consensus sequence (see Additional file 4 for all sequences). The TRANSFAC

Discussion
The PI 3-kinase/Akt/GSK-3 signaling pathway plays a central role in regulation of growth factor-dependent proliferation and survival of mammalian cells, at least in part by
transcriptional regulation. A number of transcription factors and target genes that are regulated by PI 3-kinase signaling have been studied on an individual basis. In
addition, both we [26,30,44] and others [27-29] have
used global expression profiling to investigate the overall
program of gene regulation controlled by PI 3-kinase/Akt/
GSK-3 signaling. These studies have focused on the
response of quiescent cells to growth factor stimulation,
which induces robust activation of PI 3-kinase, induction
of immediate-early genes, and re-entry into the cell cycle.

However, a lower level of continuous PI 3-kinase signaling is also required to maintain proliferation and survival
of cells in the presence of serum growth factors. In the
present study, we have therefore undertaken a global analysis of the transcriptional program that maintains cell survival and proliferation downstream of PI 3-kinase
signaling in proliferating cells.
Inhibition of PI 3-kinase in actively proliferating T98G
cells for 2 and 4 hours resulted in up-regulation of 32
genes and down-regulation of 53 genes. These gene
expression changes occurred around the time at which
apoptosis was first detected. Consistent with their involvement in apoptosis, the genes with altered expression fol-

lowing 2 and 4 hours of PI 3-kinase inhibition included
growth factors and cytokines, as well as several wellknown regulators of apoptosis (such as DDIT3/CHOP,
GADD45B, PHLDA1, BIRC3/cIAP2 and TNFRSF11B/osteoprotegerin) and cell cycle progression (such as CCNG2 and
CCND1). Functional classifications using the Gene Ontology database further indicated that these gene sets were
enriched in terms related to cell stress and programmed
cell death, as well as to cell signaling and transcriptional
regulation. The numbers of up- and down-regulated genes
both increased substantially, to a total of nearly 250
genes, after 8 hours of PI 3-kinase inhibition, probably
reflecting a secondary transcriptional response. This larger
set of genes was no longer significantly enriched in functional GO terms.
We compared the sets of genes with altered expression following 2 and 4 hours of PI 3-kinase inhibition to those

identified by previous studies of the genes induced following 0.5–4 hours of growth factor simulation of quiescent T98G cells [26,44]. Only ~10% of the genes affected
by inhibition of PI 3-kinase overlapped with either the
total sets of immediate-early or delayed primary response
genes, or with the subset of PI 3-kinase dependent immediate-early genes defined in these previous studies. Similar
to the genes that were up-regulated following inhibition
of PI 3-kinase, immediate-early genes induced in response
to growth factor stimulation were enriched in GO terms
related to transcriptional regulation [44]. However, the
transcription factors induced as immediate-early genes by
growth factor stimulation are different from those that are
up-regulated in response to PI 3-kinase inhibition. The
genes regulated by continuous PI 3-kinase signaling in
proliferating cells were thus clearly distinct from the primary response genes induced by growth factor stimulation of quiescent cells.

PI 3-kinase inhibition causes a decrease in RelB binding
PI 3-kinase inhibition causes a decrease in RelB binding. T98G cells were either maintained in serum or treated with 50
M LY294002 for 4 or 8 hours. Chromatin fragments were immunoprecipitated with anti-RelB antibody and quantified by realtime PCR. Data are presented as the percentage of input and are the means of 3 independent experiments ± S.E. -globin was

We also compared the genes affected by PI 3-kinase inhibition with the genes identified in a recent study of the
effects of mitogen withdrawal on gene expression in proliferating human fibroblasts [65]. In these experiments,
primary fetal human lung fibroblasts were cultured in the
presence of a low concentration of serum, IGF-1 and
PDGF, and were growth-arrested by withdrawal of PDGF,
which resulted in the entry of cells into G0; however, in
contrast to our experiments, no significant increase in
cells undergoing apoptosis was observed. This entry of
cells into quiescence rather than apoptosis is consistent
with the continued presence of low concentrations of
serum and IGF-1 in the experiments of Coller et al [65], in
contrast to the complete inhibition of PI 3-kinase in our
studies. Comparing these two studies indicated that very
little overlap exists between the genes regulated by inhibition of PI 3-kinase signaling and those regulated by 14
hours or 4 days of PDGF withdrawal. However, most of

the overlapping genes, including CCNG2, PLAU, BDNF,
and FGF2, and a number of non-overlapping genes regulated by mitogen withdrawal have been connected to the
regulation of cell proliferation. Thus, there are functional
overlaps in the genes regulated by PI 3-kinase inhibition
and mitogen withdrawal, although they are clearly distinct gene sets as might be expected from the differences
in treatments and their distinct effects on proliferation
and apoptosis. We note that asynchronous cells were used
in our study, and that similar analyses of synchronized
cells might reveal PI 3-kinase regulation of distinct subsets
or additional genes during specific stages of the cell cycle.
We have previously used computational analysis to identify transcription factor binding sites that are over-represented in promoter regions of immediate-early genes,
including those regulated by PI 3-kinase signaling
[26,30,44]. The transcription factors and families

Page 14 of 21
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Cell Biology 2008, 9:6

involved in regulation of these genes included CREB, SRF,
FOXO and NFB. We applied a similar analysis to the
gene sets affected by inhibition of PI 3-kinase signaling in
the present study. This revealed over-representation of
phylogenetically conserved binding sites for FOXO and
NFB upstream of the genes that were up- and down-regulated, respectively, following 2 and 4 hours of PI 3kinase inhibition. Many of the predicted FOXO and NFB
binding sites were confirmed by ChIP, indicating that the
FOXO and NFB transcription factors play major roles in
the transcriptional response to PI 3-kinase inhibition.
This is consistent with the established regulation of these
transcription factors by PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling, which
inhibits FOXO and promotes NFB activity [16,19,20].
Since p53 is also a major target of PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling in control of cell proliferation and survival [12,13], we
might have expected to similarly observe an over-representation of p53 binding sites. However, p53 is inactivated by mutation in T98G cells [66,67], accounting for its
absence in the gene sets analyzed in our experiments.
In total, we identified FOXO and NFB binding sites
upstream of about one-third of the genes that were upand down-regulated, respectively, by inhibition of PI 3kinase. Since our computational predictions of transcription factor binding sites were limited to phylogenetically
conserved sites in promoter regions, this may be an underestimate of the total fraction of PI 3-kinase regulated genes
that are targeted by these transcription factors. In particular, additional genes may be regulated by FOXO or NFB
binding sites in enhancers rather than promoter
sequences, or by sites that were not conserved in the
mouse. Other genes may be regulated at the transcriptional level by other transcription factors (such as Myc/
Max) or by non-transcriptional mechanisms, including
regulation of mRNA decay [27].
Two members of the FOXO family (FOXO1 and 3a) were
expressed in T98G cells and, as expected, both were activated in response to PI 3-kinase inhibition. In contrast,
there are 5 members of the NFB family (p65, c-Rel, RelB,
p50 and p52), which can be activated by either the canonical or non-canonical pathways, both of which are stimulated by Akt [19,20,64,68-70]). We initially demonstrated
binding of p65 to predicted NFB sites following stimulation of the canonical pathway by TNF. In unstimulated
cells growing in the presence of serum however, only
binding of p50, p52 and RelB was detected by ChIP, indicating that just the non-canonical pathway was active. Of
these three family members, RelB is the main effector of
this pathway, as it is the only one that contains a transactivation domain. Since the binding of RelB to promoters
of down-regulated genes decreased following inhibition
of PI 3-kinase, it appears that PI 3-kinase signaling regu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/9/6

lates the non-canonical pathway of NFB activation in
proliferating cells.
The 10 genes identified as targets of FOXO and the 18
identified as targets of NFB are summarized in Table 7.
Binding sites for FOXO had been previously identified
upstream of 4 of these genes, and new sites were identified
upstream of 6 genes in the present study. Similarly, the 22
NFB binding sites identified upstream of 18 genes
included 10 that were previously known, 5 that were
newly identified in genes previously known to be regulated by NFB, and 7 upstream of new NFB target genes
identified in the present study. It is noteworthy that nearly
half of the FOXO and NFB target genes whose expression
is altered in response to inhibition of PI 3-kinase are
known to function as regulators of apoptosis, including
the previously unrecognized FOXO targets DDIT3/CHOP
and TXNIP and the NFB targets AMIGO2, BDNF,
IGFBP5, and TNFRSF11B/osteoprotegerin. The predominant functions of these PI 3-kinase regulated genes
emphasize the critical role of PI 3-kinase/Akt regulation of
the FOXO and NFB transcription factors in maintaining
cell survival.

Conclusion
PI 3-kinase signaling in proliferating cells regulates a
novel program of gene expression, which is distinct from
that induced by growth factor stimulation of quiescent
cells. The expression program controlled by continuous PI
3-kinase signaling in proliferating cells is enriched in
genes that regulate cell survival and is mediated in large
part by FOXO and RelB transcription factors.

Methods
Cell Culture and RNA Extraction
T98G human glioblastoma cells were grown in Minimal
Essential Medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (HyClone) and 100 units/ml of penicillin/
streptomycin (Invitrogen). U937 cells were grown in
RPMI 1640 (Cellgro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(HyClone). For LY294002 treatments, T98G cells were
plated at 2 × 106 cells per 150 mm plate or 8 × 105 cells per
100 mm plate and U937 cells at 3 × 106 cells per 25 cm
flask. T98G cells were cultured for 48 hours and U937
cells for 24 hours, at which time they were actively proliferating with a doubling time of approximately 20 hours.
LY294002 (Biomol) was added to a final concentration of
50 M. Wortmannin (Biomol) was added to a final concentration of 50 nM. Culturing of cells for serum starvation and subsequent treatments with either PDGF-BB (50
ng/ml) or 20% serum were carried out as previously
described [44].

All PI 3-kinase regulated genes containing upstream binding sites for either FOXO or NFB are listed. Genes containing a previously reported
FOXO or NFB binding site, and the relevant reference, are in bold. The biological activity of each gene, as it pertains to growth factor/receptor or
cytokine, transcription, proliferation, and apoptosis, is indicated along with references for these activities.

Apoptosis Assays
Apoptosis was assayed by DNA fragmentation and TUNEL
staining as previously described [71].
Immunoblot
Enriched cytosolic and nuclear fractions were isolated
from normal growing T98G cells as described elsewhere
[72]. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis in 8% or
12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer), and
immunoblotted with anti-phospho Akt (Cell Signaling
9271), pan-anti-Akt (Cell Signaling 9272), anti-FOXO3a
(Upstate 07-702), anti-FOX01 (Santa Cruz sc-11350),
anti-FOXO4 (Santa Cruz sc-5221), anti-PARP (poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase) (Cell Signaling 9542), and
anti-14-3-3 (Upstate 06-511) as recommended by the
manufacturer. The immunoblots were visualized using
goat anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-goat horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) and chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer). Densitometry was performed
using IQMac v1.2 software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale,
CA).
Microarray Analysis
Microarray spotting, sample preparation, hybridization,
image analysis and data analysis were performed as previously described [44]. Microarrays were spotted with
21,329 70-mer oligonucleotides from Operon's Human
Genome Array-Ready Oligo Set Version 2.0. RNA for
microarray experiments was extracted with TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen) followed by poly(A)+ RNA isolation with an
Oligotex mRNA Midi Kit (Qiagen) according to each manufacturer's protocol. Microarrays were performed with
three independent biological samples. Dye-swap, background-subtracted median intensity values were used as
input to the LIMMA analysis package [73] in Bioconductor [74], and average LOESS-corrected log2 ratios were
used to estimate differential gene expression after
LY294002 treatment. Differentially expressed genes were

those with a change in expression greater than or equal to
1.87 fold (Log2 0.9) relative to untreated samples and
false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected [75] moderated t-test
p-values less than 0.01.
Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)
Real-time RT-PCR was carried out as previously described
on RNA samples isolated from either T98G cells or U937
cells treated with LY294002 for 4 hours [26].
Gene Ontology Analysis
Gene Ontology (GO) terms were obtained using the webbased tool GOstat [76]. The genes that were either up- or
down-regulated following 2 and 4 hours of PI 3-kinase
inhibition were independently analyzed from the genes
that were either up- or down-regulated following 8 hours
of PI 3-kinase inhibition. Enrichment of GO categories
was determined by comparing the terms associated with
the differentially regulated genes to the terms associated
with all genes on the array using a Fisher's exact test. Only
genes annotated with at least 1 term were included in the
analysis. Results were limited to the GO categories that
were associated with at least 15% of the genes, with p <
0.001.
Transcription Factor Binding Site Analysis
Over-representation of transcription factor binding sites
in the upstream regions of genes that were differentially
expressed in response to inhibition of PI 3-kinase was
determined as previously described [26,30,44]. The genes
that were either up- or down-regulated following 2 and 4
hours of PI 3-kinase inhibition were independently analyzed from the genes that were either up- or down-regulated following 8 hours of PI 3-kinase inhibition. The
regions 3 kb upstream of transcription start sites in the
human and the corresponding mouse orthologous
sequences were analyzed with the Match program using
the MinSUM threshold [77], and both the 548 vertebrate

position weight matrices from TRANSFAC Professional
version 8.4 and the 588 matrices from TRANSFAC version
11.1 [78]. Sequences and MULTIZ alignments were
obtained from the University of California Santa Cruz
Genome Browser (human version hg18, mouse version
mm8) [79], which were available for 28 of the 32 up-regulated genes and for 48 of the 53 down-regulated genes.
For each matrix, a permutation test was used to compare
the frequencies of the predicted sites in the differentially
expressed gene set to the frequencies of the predicted sites
in a background set of 662 genes that were expressed but
did not change expression upon PI 3-kinase inhibition
(average log2 ratios between -0.01 and 0.01). P-values
were FDR-corrected to adjust for multiple testing [75].

Flag-FOXO3a-AAA Chromatin Immunoprecipitations
T98G cells were plated at 4 × 105 cells per 100 mm plate
in complete media 24 hours before transfection. TransIT
(Mirus Bio) reagent was used to transfect 8 g of either
pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) or pcDNA3-Flag-FOXO3a-AAA
[Addgene plasmid 10709, provided by Dr. William R.
Sellers [46]], as recommended by the manufacturer. 24
hours after transfection 3 identical plates were harvested
and ChIP assays were performed as previously described
[30] except that chromatin was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4°C using 10 g of anti-M5-Flag (Sigma F4042)
antibody and Protein G agarose beads (Upstate). Protein
G agarose beads were washed successively in low salt
wash, high salt wash, LiCl wash and twice in 1xTE. Immunoprecipitated chromatin was quantified with real-time
PCR using primers designed within 250 bp of the predicted transcription factor binding sites.
NFB Chromatin Immunoprecipitations
For treatment with TNF, T98G cells were plated at 8 ×
105 cells per 100 mm plate in complete media 48 hours
before treatment. Cells were then either left untreated, or
treated with 20 g/ml of TNF (R & D Systems) for 0.25,
0.5 or 1 hour. For experiments using unstimulated cells,
T98G cells were plated at 2 × 106 cells per 150 mm plate,
and ChIP assays performed 48 hours after plating. When
indicated, cells were treated with 50 M LY294002 for 4
or 8 hours. ChIP assays were performed as previously
described [30], except that either 5 g of p65 antibody, cRel antibody, p50 antibody, RelB antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, sc-372, sc-71, sc-114, sc-226), or 5 l of
p52 antibody (Upstate, 06-413) was used for the immunoprecipitations. Protein A agarose beads were washed
successively in low salt wash, high salt wash, LiCl wash
and twice in 1xTE. Immunoprecipitated chromatin was
quantified by real-time PCR using primers that were
located within 320 bp of the predicted binding site.
