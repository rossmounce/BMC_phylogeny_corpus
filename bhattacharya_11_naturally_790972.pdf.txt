virus in the United States

Abstract
Background: Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infected patients are frequently repeatedly exposed to the virus, but very few
recombinants between two genotypes have been reported.
Findings: We describe the discovery of an HCV recombinant using a method developed in a United States clinical
lab for HCV genotyping that employs sequencing of both 5’ and 3’ portions of the HCV genome. Over twelve
months, 133 consecutive isolates were analyzed, and a virus from one patient was found with discordant 5’ and 3’
sequences suggesting it was a genotype 2b/1a recombinant. We ruled out a mixed infection and mapped a
recombination point near the NS2/3 cleavage site.
Conclusions: This unique HCV recombinant virus described shares some features with other recombinant viruses
although it is the only reported recombinant of a genotype 2 with a subtype 1a. This recombinant represents a
conundrum for current clinical treatment guidelines, including treatment with protease inhibitors. This recombinant
is also challenging to detect by the most commonly employed methods of genotyping that are directed primarily
at the 5’ structural portion of the HCV genome.

Background
The WHO estimates that 130-170 million people worldwide are infected with HCV [1]. Six major genotypes
(lineages) of HCV have spread throughout the world
[2,3]. Viral genotype is well recognized as the most significant prognostic factor in terms of response to therapy, and a characteristic upon which to base the
antiviral prescription [4]. Therefore, the best methods
and the most definitive viral target(s) for determining
the HCV genotype during patient care remains an
important area of translational research. Infection with
any genotype can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer
in a minority of patients. While specific genotypes dominate in certain regions of the world (for example, genotype 4 in the Middle East), many regions have multiple
genotypes circulating including Europe and the United
States. People with repeated use of intravenous needles
and contaminated blood products in these regions likely
are exposed to more than one genotype of HCV. Both
mixed infections and recombinant viruses have been

described. These situations are thought to be uncommon, particularly natural recombination between two
genotypes. Genetic incompatibilities between the viral
proteins of different genotypes have been suggested as a
reason for recombination in HCV to be a rare event [5].
Here we describe a case report of a patient who was
chronically infected over an extended period of time
with a recombinant HCV strain. Like all other naturally
occurring inter-genotypic recombinants reported to
date, this strain has a genotype 2 5’ portion of the genome encoding the structural region, while the nonstructural coding region is from a different genotype. The
crossover junction was mapped to the NS2/3 region.
We also compared the sequence to other recombinants,
but could find limited evidence to support the proposed
theory that stable RNA hairpin structures can promote
recombination and bracket the cross over junction.

Methods
Clinical Genotyping

Total nucleic acid was extracted from patient plasma
using the Roche AmpliPrep ® TNAI kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). The nucleic acid was reverse-transcribed
with random primers, AMV RT, and 0.2 mM

deoxynucleotides (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR was
performed on a Roche LightCycler ® 480 with Roche
LightCycler ® 480 SYBR Green I Master mix, primers
(A and B in Table 1; [6-8]) specific for either the
5’UTR or NS5B regions (TIB Molbiol, Adelphia, NJ)
and 2uL of the RT-PCR product. Products of amplification were sequenced bidirectionally using Big Dye
(Applied Biosystems) on an Applied Biosystems 3100
instrument. Sequences were compared to a database
consisting of 100 reference HCV 5’UTR and 58 reference NS5B sequences from the Los Alamos National
Laboratory [9] using Assign-ATF software (Conexio
Genomics, Fremantle, Australia).

from the recombinant virus and both 1a and 2b reverse
primers from the alignment into the reaction (Table 1)
to generate amplification products 1-4 (Figure 1). Fragments 5, 6, and 7 were done only with 1a primers. PCR
fragments were restricted to be between 900 to 2000
basepairs. Seven fragments were amplified from RNA
covering the full polyprotein and the 5’ UTR of the
recombinant virus. After amplification the PCR products
were gel purified and cloned into a TOPO TA cloning
vector (Invitrogen, CA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. After identifying the positive clones the cDNA
inserts were sequenced bidirectionally with Big Dye
(Applied Biosystems) at the UW-Madison Biotechnology
facility.

Sequencing of Recombinant

Seven different fragments (Figure 1, Parts of HCV genome 1-7) of the discordant virus identified were
sequenced. Each fragment of cDNA synthesis was done
from viral RNA, extracted from patient serum, by
SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum
Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, CA) kit according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Forward and reverse primers were designed based on an alignment [10] (ClustalW program available online from http://www.genome.
jp/tools/clustalw/) of 217 genotype 1a sequences and 26
genotype 2 sequences from the European HCV databases [11]. Each primer from the alignment was selected
from regions displaying 40-70% consensus within the
respective alignment. RT-PCR amplification was performed by adding an entirely conserved forward primer

Bioinformatic Analysis

A web-based program http://www.phylogeny.fr/ was
used to analyze the recombinant strain relative to other
HCV strains [12]. All sequencing data were collected
and searched against the NCBI database using a webbased nucleotide BLAST program http://blast.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/Blast.cgi. For identification of a more specific
junction, analyses were performed using the SimPlot
program [(Version 3.5.1) [13] available online from
http://sray.med.som.jhmi.edu/SCRoftware/simplot]. The
RNA secondary structure was analyzed using the
MFOLD program with default parameters. The MFOLD

The entire nucleotide sequences of this recombinant
virus have been submitted to GenBank and assigned

Results
DNA Sequencing clinical isolates at two different regions
of the HCV genome produces mostly concordant results

Over a 12 month period, the Molecular Diagnostic lab
at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics
(UWHC) performed a bidirectional consensus sequencing reaction of 203 base pairs of the 5’ UTR as well as
a separate bidirectional consensus sequencing reaction
of the 222 base pair fragment of NS5B for 133 consecutive patients. As expected, based on genotype 1 being
the most common in the United States, almost 70% of
the time the NS5B subtype was 1a (90 different
patients). Therefore, if a patient in our population was
exposed to multiple HCV strains both the first and the
second exposure might be subtype 1a viruses. In all
cases but one, the genotype determined by the 5’ UTR
matched that determined by the NS5B fragment (subtype discrepancies between genotype 1 were unresolvable due to the lack of specificity of the 5 ‘UTR [15,16].
The only exception was an isolate with a 5’ UTR that
matched best with genotype 2b sequences (Figure 2a),
while the corresponding NS5B sequence from that isolate matched best with a genotype 1a sequence (Figure
2b). Neither the 5’ UTR 2b sequence nor the NS5B
sequence perfectly matched with previously determined

sequences in our patient population during this study
period, although the 2b sequence was identical to an
isolate from one patient prior to this twelve month period of time which had been identified as a 2b 5’ UTR
(see Figure 2a). Sequencing of the isolate with the near
identical 2b 5’ UTR sequence by NS5B primers was consistent with a 2b genotype. Furthermore the uridine
position at base pair 204 of the 5’ UTR (numbering
according to H77 GenBank # AF009606) from this isolate was found to be a mixed population containing
both uridine as well as the cytidine more commonly
seen among isolates characterized as 2b at our
institution.
The discordant clinical isolate is a 2b/1a recombinant
virus with a crossover at the NS2/NS3 Junction

Since isolates from four separate blood draws of a single
patient over 5 months yielded a discordant 2b and 1a
genotype from DNA sequencing of the 5’ UTR and
NS5B regions, respectively, both subtype specific 2b and
1a primers were designed and used to amplify from base
pair 73-313 and 8256-8644 (Table 1, Figure 1) across
the HCV genome. Strong amplification was seen with
2b primers throughout the structural regions, but not
downstream of NS2. Conversely, 1a primers either failed
or weakly amplified the structural gene region upstream
of NS2, but strongly amplified sequences encoding the
nonstructural proteins. The entire reconstructed genome
was submitted to GenBank (accession # JF779679 hereafter denoted RF8_2/1a). Previously, we and others have
noted that subtype 1a has two distinct clades provisionally termed 1a1 and 1a2 [17]. Both clades are widely dispersed temporally and across the globe with the
prototypical H77 strain being representative of the 1a1
clade. Phylogenetic analysis of just the NS3-5B region of

Figure 2 Fewer unique sequences of HCV subtype 2b (Panel A) than 1a (Panel B) were identified at UWHC. A) DNA sequence of the 5’
UTR of the discordant 2b/1a strain is aligned with several representative non-discordant 2b strains, as well as the 5’ UTR of the prototypical 1a
H77 strain. These 8 sequences represent all the sequence diversity of this region of the 14 2b subtypes found in the 12 months in which both
the 5’ UTR and NS5B regions were sequenced. B) Alignment of the NS5B protein and nucleotide sequence of the 2b/1a discordant strain with
three typical 1a strains as well as a 2b reference strain. NS5B DNA sequence of isolate A is quite close to the 2b/1a strain, but the NS5B DNA
sequences of isolates B and C are less similar, yet more typical of 1a strains from UWHC, with 3 identical sequences from the 90 subtype 1a
sequences determined in the 12 month period.

this recombinant strain shows it partitions with strains
in the 1a2 clade (Figure 3A) rather than strains in the
1a1 clade including H77. A representative 2b genome
(AY232740), the H77 genome (AF009606), as well as a
1a2 genome (EU255981) were all used as reference
sequences to compare with the recombinant sequence
via Simplot. As shown in Figure 3B, the identity of this
strain is over 95% with a 2b sequence (AY232740) until
the end of the NS2 gene, at which point it drops off
below 82%, but climbs to over 95% identity when compared to a genotype 1a strain (EU255981). Most breakthrough viremia in patients on protease inhibitors that
has been characterized to date has occurred in subtype
1a infected patients [18]. This is consistent with a codon
bias between 1b and 1a isolates in which most 1b
patients require two mutations to occur in the codon
for residue 155 of NS3, whereas most 1a patients
require only a single base pair change to encode for
lysine rather than arginine. Accordingly, the NS3
sequence from this recombinant isolate also requires
only a single base pair change from UUG to encode a
lysine and subsequently confer protease resistance.
While HCV recombinants between two different genotypes are rare, closely related putative parental strains
and several different isolates of the RF_2k/1b have been
sequenced. Based on RNA structural analysis and
recombinants seen in the plant virus turnip crinkle
virus, mechanisms that might lead to recombination

have been proposed including the identification of two
stable RNA hairpins upstream and downstream of the
crossover site in the parental strains that are putatively
destabilized by mutations in the recombinant [14]. For
example, the hairpin structure 1 (HS1) observed in the
recombinant is present in the parental 2k strain, but is
destabilized slightly by the acquisition of two mutations
present in the recombinant RF1_2k/1b. Additionally, a
hairpin downstream of the crossover site in the 1b parental strain was destabilized by 5 mutations present in
the RF_2k/1b recombinant. We examined if this hairpin
was also present in the RF8_ 2/1a reported here or in
any of the other recombinants with a genotype 2 5’
UTR-NS2 region. Although, all recombinants exhibited
RNA base pairing in this region, all secondary structures
appeared less stable than that of RF_2k/1b (data not
shown), with two small stems being predicted rather
than one longer stem. Non-recombinant 2b and the
RF8_ 2/1a have similarly stable hairpins in this region,
however, neither are as stable as the 2k hairpin (recombinant or parental).

Discussion
For over ten years, HCV genotyping has been the critical parameter to determine both the likelihood of
response to therapy, as well as the duration of therapy
needed to obtain a Sustained Virologic Response (SVR)
[19-21]. While several HCV genotyping methods exist,

none are FDA approved in the United States. These
methods are based on primarily targeting only the
5’structural regions of virus and thus cannot easily identify recombinant strains. Based on the last Hepatitis
Viral Load proficiency survey (HVL-C) administered by
the College of American Pathologists in 2010 [22], the
most commonly employed HCV genotyping method,
utilized by over 60% (110/177) of participating clinical
diagnostic labs in the United States, is the Versant HCV
(LiPA) 2.0 assay (manufactured by Innogenetics, distributed by Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics). While CE

marked in Europe and approved for research use only in
the United States, this assay is based on line probe
hybridization targeting DNA sequence information
within the 5’ UTR and the contiguous structural core
(C) region of HCV (Figure 1). While 9% (16/177) of participants did conduct genotyping by DNA sequencing
using the Siemens Diagnostics TruGene system, sequencing information is again only obtained from the 5’ UTR
of HCV. These 5’ structural regions have been utilized
historically for genotyping because they are adequately
conserved such that a limited number of primers or

probes can amplify and recognize all isolates, respectively, but have sufficient diversity to distinguish
between non-recombinant genotypes 1-6. However, it
should be noted that information provided solely by the
5’UTR is insufficient for subtype identification and in
some cases for genotype identification.
Several studies looking for HCV recombinants in
intravenous drug users and other populations where
multiple exposures are likely have been performed and
in general recombination does seem to be a rare event
[23]. While other reports of recombination between different genotypes exist [24], the DNA sequence of entire
recombinant genomes and site of recombination
remains to be determined. Interestingly, all full-length
recombinants described to date between two genotypes
have included a 5’ portion of genotype 2 [25-29]. So far
only RF1_2k/1b has been shown to be circulating in
multiple patients described in Russia [26], Ireland [30],
Estonia [31] and Uzbekistan [32]. As shown in Figure 4,
all reported HCV recombinants have similar, but nonidentical cross over points to the RF8_2/1a (reported
here) or RF1_2k/1b.
It remains unclear how much of the genome needs to
be genotype 2 in order for the clinical response to justify
a 12-24 week treatment course rather than 48 weeks
advocated for genotype 1. Both within genotype 1, as
well as between genotypes 1 and 2, there are known differences between the ability of NS5A to bind the ds
RNA induced PKR [33]. These differences in NS5A
binding alter the cellular interferon mediated antiviral
response that in turn has been postulated to explain the
corresponding clinical response. Clinical response to
interferon-based regimens depends upon both viral

Recombination sites

factors (including NS5A and E2 glycoprotein) as well as
host genetic factors, including lambda interferon polymorphisms [34], but the viral genotype assigned by clinical labs should closely reflect related strains and ideally
indicate the historical antiviral response for those
strains. Data from a chimeric mouse model, as well as
anecdotal clinical data, suggests the RF1_2k/1b strain is
more resistant to interferon than some genotype 2
strains [32]. As protease inhibitors and other directly
acting antivirals become available, it will become
increasingly important to know the genotype of each
viral drug target of the isolate infecting the patient in
order to determine the most effective therapy for that
patient, and minimize the side-effects of therapy. Data
from the PROVE 3 Protease Inhibitor trial [35], among
others [18], suggests that subtyping may be clinically
useful. Unfortunately, current methods for HCV genotyping primarily solely targeting the 5’UTR and possibly
contiguous core (C) structural regions do not provide
sufficient information across the entire genome to detect
the possibility of recombinant species which may be critical for the determination for treatment efficacy.
In conclusion, we report here the first naturally occurring HCV recombinant in the United States. While
clearly an independent event from other recombinants,
this strain shares several characteristics with those previously reported in that it has genotype 2 5’ UTR and
structural genes, and a crossover point near the NS2/3
junction. At this time we cannot tell whether this
recombinant strain is circulating in patients besides the
one reported here, but the patient was viremic from this
strain for months and likely years. Hybridization probe
techniques and DNA sequencing targeting only the 5’

UTR/core regions are frequently used to clinically genotype HCV to determine the dose and duration of therapy. One advantage of using direct DNA sequencing to
genotype viruses is that the DNA sequence of amplified
regions can be aligned with known recombinants, such
as the strain reported here, particularly if multiple
regions are sequenced. Using this approach, undiscovered recombinants may still be missed depending on the
regions amplified, but at least an assessment of whether
further testing is needed to rule out known recombinants can be made. The presence of circulating recombinants of HCV may have significant ramifications for
the efficacy and selection of therapy. Clearly more comprehensive HCV genotyping is required to ascertain the
significance of HCV recombinant isolates in clinical
practice.
