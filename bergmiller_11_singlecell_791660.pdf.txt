Single-cell time-lapse analysis of depletion of the
universally conserved essential protein YgjD
Tobias Bergmiller1*, Rafael Peña-Miller2, Alexander Boehm3 and Martin Ackermann1

Abstract
Background: The essential Escherichia coli gene ygjD belongs to a universally conserved group of genes whose
function has been the focus of a number of recent studies. Here, we put ygjD under control of an inducible
promoter, and used time-lapse microscopy and single cell analysis to investigate the phenotypic consequences of
the depletion of YgjD protein from growing cells.
Results: We show that loss of YgjD leads to a marked decrease in cell size and termination of cell division. The
transition towards smaller size occurs in a controlled manner: cell elongation and cell division remain coupled, but
cell size at division decreases. We also find evidence that depletion of YgjD leads to the synthesis of the
intracellular signaling molecule (p)ppGpp, inducing a cellular reaction resembling the stringent response.
Concomitant deletion of the relA and spoT genes - leading to a strain that is uncapable of synthesizing (p)ppGpp abrogates the decrease in cell size, but does not prevent termination of cell division upon YgjD depletion.
Conclusions: Depletion of YgjD protein from growing cells leads to a decrease in cell size that is contingent on
(p)ppGpp, and to a termination of cell division. The combination of single-cell timelapse microscopy and statistical
analysis can give detailed insights into the phenotypic consequences of the loss of essential genes, and can thus
serve as a new tool to study the function of essential genes.

Background
Genes that are highly conserved between different types
of organisms code for important biological functions
and are therefore usually well studied and described.
One group of conserved genes whose function has
remained enigmatic until recently is the Kae1(OSGEP)/
YgjD family. Genes from this family occur in almost all
bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic genomes. The gene
family consists of two groups: one group, GCP1/
OSGEPL/Qri7, is of bacterial origin, the other, GCP2/
OSGEP/Kae, is supposed to originate from archaea [1].
In Escherichia coli, Kae1/YgjD is essential for viability
[2,3]; in Arabidopsis thaliana and Saccharomyces cerevisia, deletion mutants exhibit deleterious phenotypes
[4-6].
A biochemical activity for YgjD has recently been
described: as already suggested by [7], Srinivasan and
colleagues [8] showed that Kae1/YgjD protein (of

Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli, respectively) is required to add a threonyl carbamoyl adenosine (t6A) modification to a subset of tranfer-RNAs that
recognize codons with an adenin at the first position.
Transfer-RNAs undergo complex modifications and
maturation steps [9] required for translational fidelity
[10-12]. Mutations in these modification pathways can
be lethal or cause severe defects [13-15], and the
involved genes are highly conserved in different organisms [14-16].
Because ygjD is essential, it is not possible to delete
the gene and study the phenotypic consequences. As an
alternative, one can put the gene under control of an
inducible promoter, and investigate the consequence of
turning off its expression, and thereby depleting the
YgjD protein. Our aim here is to get insights into the
morphological changes that come about when the YgjD
protein is depleted from growing Escherichia coli cells.
In two studies ([3] and [17]), the authors have noticed
an effect on cell size in YgjD depletion strains, suggesting a role of YgjD for cell division and/or cellular elongation. However, while Katz et al. observed shorter cells

under YgjD depletion conditions, Handford et al.
observed a mixed population of elongated and short
cells. The reason for this discrepancy remained unclear
but could be based on the different genetic background
of the E. coli strains (MC4100 versus MG1655). Altered
cell size upon YgjD depletion could be based on changes
in cell division timing or the cellular elongation rate, or
on a combination of these two effects. To distinguish
between these possibilities and to clarify the role of
YgjD for cell size we used single cell resolution timelapse microscopy of growing microcolonies.
We constructed a conditional lethal ygjD mutant, and
investigated the consequences of depletion of the YgjD
protein with high temporal resolution at the single-cell
level. Similarly to ([3,6,17]) we put the expression of
ygjD under control of a promoter that is inducible by
the sugar L-arabinose. The resulting strain can be
grown normally in presence of L-arabinose, but ceases
to grow in absence of L-arabinose and presence of glucose. Then, single bacterial cells are placed on a nutritious agar surface lacking the inducer and are observed
with time lapse microscopy.
We used the cell tracking software “Schnitzcell”[18] to
analyze images from the time-lapse microscopy experiments. This software identifies cells and tracks them
across images from consecutive time points. It keeps
track of cell division events and of relatedness of cells
(e.g., it can relate each cell to the other cell that
emerged from the same division). The software also
extracts information about cell size and fluorescence
intensity. The resulting dataset can be used to reconstruct the lineage of the clonal microcolony, and to plot
phenotypic information like cell size and fluorescence
intensity on this lineage. We used derivatives of these
parameters (cell elongation rate and interval between
divisions) to describe and analyze the effects of YgjD
depletion.

We find that depletion of YgjD changes the balance
between cell growth and cell division, indicating a disturbance in cell size homeostasis. Experiments with
Escherichia coli and Salmonella thyphimurium have
shown a high degree of cell size homeostasis, or
balanced growth [19]: under steady state conditions,
cells have a constant cell size, indicating that the rate by
which cells elongate and the interdivision intervals are
coupled - cells that grow slower will initiate cell division
later, and thus reach a goal cell size despite their slower
growth. Under conditions of YgjD depletion, cell elongation slowed down while the interval between cell divisions remained constant. As a consequence, cell size
steadily decreased over consecutive divisions, until a
minimal size was reached and cell division stopped.
These cellular changes are specific: they differ from the
consequences of the depletion of three other essential
genes we analyzed, and of the exposure to two antibiotics that inhibit translation.
Using a statistical approach, we show that this growth
transition occurs in a controlled manner: cell elongation
rates and interdivision times were negatively correlated
on the level of single cells, suggesting that these two
physiological parameters remain coupled during the
growth transition. Genetic experiments indicated that
this change in cell size homeostasis involves production
of the alarmone (p)ppGpp (guanosine-penta/tetra-phosphate), a signaling compound that is a key player of a
cellular response to amino acid starvation known as
stringent response.

Results and Discussion
Our rationale here is that we can get insights into the
biological role of YgjD by following the cellular response
of its depletion on the single cell level and with high
temporal resolution. We diluted cultures of the conditional lethal Para-ygjD mutant TB80 onto pads of solid
LB medium that either contained L-arabinose (inducing
ygjD expression) or D-glucose (repressing ygjD expression) and used time-lapse microscopy to follow single
cells growing into microcolonies, taking an image every
2 or 4 minutes. The images were analyzed with the software “Schnitzcell” [18]. The growth rate and cellular
morphology of the P ara -ygjD strain grown in the presence of L-arabinose was similar to the wild type grown
under the same conditions (Figure 1a and 1c, and Additional file 1 - movie 1 and Additional file 2 - movie 2).
A shift of the Para-ygjD strain to glucose lead to the
depletion of YgjD. This depletion is based on two
effects. First, transcription of ygjD stops after the shift to
glucose. Residual L-arabinose that remains in the cells
from growth under permissive conditions is rapidly
metabolized. Lack of L-arabinose turns the transcriptional activator (AraC) of the P ara promoter into a

transcription repressor. In addition, glucose metabolism
causes depletion of the cellular co-inducer cyclic AMP.
Together these effects lead to effective repression of
ygjD transcription in TB80. After termination of de novo
ygjD mRNA synthesis the amount of YgjD in each cell
declines, because the mRNA and the protein are diluted
through cell division, and degraded by cellular nucleases
and proteases, respectively [20]. The rapid cessation of
transcription from Para after the shift to glucose was evident in control experiments with a strain that expressed
the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the arabinose
promoter (Additional file 3 - Figure S1)
YgjD depletion leads to a change in cell size homeostasis

Time-lapse microscopy revealed that YgjD depletion
lead to a gradual phenotypic transition in division and
growth. Single cells that were transferred from permissive conditions to solid pads of LB medium with glucose
first continued to divide regularly, forming microcolonies in which the number of cells initially increased
exponentially. Then, after about four divisions, cell division slowed down and stopped (Figure 1b and Additional file 4 - movie 3). Analysis of the time-lapse
images (Additional file 4 - movie 3) showed that, during
this transition, cells size decreased (Figure 2a). This
indicates a disturbance in of cell size homeostasis [19] that cells divide before their cell size doubled.
We used elongation rates of single cells and the time
interval between two divisions to analyze the change in
cell size homeostasis during YgjD depletion. Since we
were interested in how these parameters changed during

depletion, we separated data from different cell generations of the depletion process. The first cell that is
founding a microcolony is generation 0; this cell divides
into two cells of generation 1, which divide into four
cells of generation 2, and so on (also see Additional File
5 - Figure S2). To avoid comparisons between cells that
are in different phases of their cell cycle, we only used
cell size measurements (and later fluorescence intensities) of cells immediately before division. Also, to avoid
incomplete and biased sampling, we removed data from
above generation 6.
This analysis revealed that the small size of cells
depleted for YgjD was a consequence of two effects:
first, the rate of elongation (cell length increase over
time) decreased (Figure 3a). Second, cells did not
respond to the decrease in elongation rate by adjusting
the frequency at which they divided; the interval
between two cell divisions remained initially constant.
As a direct consequence, cell length at division
decreased continuously (Figure 2a).
The phenotype induced by YgjD depletion was specific, and depletions of other essential genes lead to different cellular morphologies. We analyzed time-lapse
images of the depletion of three other essential genes
(dnaT, fldA and ffh). Depletion of each protein resulted
in cellular phenotypes that were different from each
other and from YgjD when depleted (Additional file 6 Figure S3; also see Additional Files 7, 8 and 9 - movies
4, 5 and 6). Also, the effects of YgjD depletion were different from the consequences of exposure to two antibiotics that we tested: we followed wildtype E. coli cells

Figure 2 Depletion of YgjD lead to a change in cell size homeostasis. The figure is based on data from one microcolony of TB80 (Para-ygjD)
depleted for YgjD (A; also see Additional File 4 - movie 3) and E. coli wildtype MG1655 (B; also see Additional File 2 - movie 2). Each point
represents information about one cell, and the color of the point indicates which generation this cell belongs to (for a definition of ‘generation’
see main text). A) Changes in cell size during YgjD depletion. Cell size at division decreases continuously during the depletion experiment; B)

exposed to the translational inhibitors kanamycin and
chloramphenicol at minimum inhibitory concentration
(2.5 μg/ml for chloramphenicol, 5 μg/ml for kanamycin),
and observed no decrease in cell size (Additional file 10
- Figure S4, and Additional Files 11 and 12 - movies 7
and 8).
For reference, we also analyzed images of growing
microcolonies of wildtype E. coli MG1655 cells on LB
medium supplemented with glucose. This experiments
confirmed cell size homeostasis, as expected from normally growing cell: cells divided close to the moment
when they had doubled their size, and small fluctuations
in cell elongation rates were compensated for by adjustments in the time of cell division (Figure 2b and 3b).
The transition towards smaller cell size is controlled

What kind of disturbance of cell size homeostasis is
induced by depletion of YgjD? We considered two possibilities. First, it is possible that the control that couples
cell division to cell size is lost, so that cells divide in an
uncontrolled way, irrespective of their size. Second, it is
conceivable that cell division remains coupled to cell
size, but the target size that a cell needs to reach before
initiating division decreases over time.
If the decrease in cell size is the result of a controlled
transition towards smaller cells, one would expect that,

during the transition, the cell elongation rate and the
timing of cell division would still be linked, but that this
link would change quantitatively over time. In fact this
is what we observed when we analyzed each generation
of cells during the depletion process separately (inserts
Figure 3a and 3b). Within a given generation the time
interval between divisions and the rate by which a cell
elongated was negatively correlated: cells that grew faster than the average of their generation tended to initiate division more quickly; cells that grew more slowly
initiated division later. This suggests that cell growth
and the timing of cell division are still linked within
each generation in the depletion process, but that this
link changes quantitatively over successive generations.
This analysis has, however, an important limitation:
cells within a given generation are not independent
from each other. Some of these cells are more closely
related, because they derive from the same mother or
grandmother. This can lead to spurious correlations
between traits; in our case, this effect could lead to artificial correlations between cell elongation rates and
interdivision intervals. This problem of relatedness in
lineage trees is known from phylogenetic studies, where
it is referred to as phylogenetic dependence [21]. In the
context of phylogenetic studies, these dependencies can
be resolved by analyzing differences between

Difference in cell elongation rate

Figure 3 Cell elongation rate and the interval between two divisions are coupled during YgjD depletion. The contour line depicts all
combinations of cell elongation rate and interval between divisions that correspond to a cell size doubling before division. Points below the
contour line corresponds to cells that divide before they double in size, and whose size thus steadily declines. A) The relationship between the
cell elongation rate and the interval between two divisions during YgjD depletion (Movie 2, additional files), and B) for MG1655 (Movie 3,
additional files). For YgjD depletion, cell elongation rate starts to decrease from generation 3 on. However, this decrease in cell elongation rate
is initially not compensated for by an increase in the interval between two divisions. Points below the contour line correspond to cells that
divide before they double in size, and whose size thus steadily declines. The inset lists the result of a non-parametric correlation analysis
between ‘cell elongation rate’ and ‘time to division’, performed separately for every generation. A negative correlation indicates coupling of the
interval between division and the cell elongation rate. For MG1655, the majority of cells cluster around the contour line. C) and D) show the
result of the independent contrast correlation analysis for YgjD depletion in TB80, and MG1655 growth. Each point depicts the difference
(residual) between two sister cells in the cell elongation rate (horizontal axis) and in the interval between cell divisions (vertical axis). Cells that
have a higher elongation rate than their sister tend to have a shorter interval between divisions. The inset lists the result of a non-parametric
correlation analysis between ‘difference in cell elongation rate’ and ‘difference in interval between two divisions’, performed separately for every
generation. Again, negative correlation indicates coupling of the interval between division and the cell elongation rate.

Changes in cell size homeostastis are mediated through
ppGpp

We constructed a strain, TB84, that is deficient in (p)
ppGpp synthesis ((p)pGpp0), due to deletions of relA and
spoT [26,27], and in which expression of ygjD was again
under control of Para. We followed growing microcolonies of TB84 as described above and found that the consequences of YgjD depletion were profoundly different:
cell elongation rate decreased during the YgjD depletion
process as for the relA+ spoT+ strain TB80 (Figure 4a). In
contrast to what we observed with this (p)ppGpp+ strain,
the decrease in elongation rate was compensated for by
an increase in the time interval between two divisions
(Additional file 14 - movie 9, and Figure 4a). As a consequence, cell size at division was not reduced, and the

independent pairs of species, rather than calculating
correlations on the basis of the whole phylogenetic lineage [21].
We used a variation of this approach to get an
unbiased view on the relationship between cell growth
and the timing of cell division: for each generation, we
analyzed pairs of cells emerging from the same cell division, and calculated the difference in growth rates and
in the time to division for each pair. We refer to two
cells emerging from the same division as ‘sisters’
(thereby ignoring that these two cells have cell poles of
different ages, [22,23]). The differences for all sister
pairs represent independent data points, and we can use
them to calculate the correlation between cell growth
and time to division in an unbiased way.
The independent contrast analysis confirmed our earlier conclusions: comparing each cell to its sister cell,
we found that cells that grew slower than their sisters
also displayed a longer interval between cell divisions,
while faster growing cells divided earlier. This manifests
as a negative correlation between the difference in cell
elongation rate and the difference in interdivision intervals between two sisters (inserts Figure 3c and 3d; see
also Additional File 13 - Figure S5). This is consistent
with the interpretation that, during YgjD depletion, the
timing of cell division remained coupled to a given cell
size - and that the target cell size declined.
The transition to decreased cell size is reminiscent of
morphological changes that occur during the ‘stringent
response’ [24,25], a stress adaptation program that is elicited when cells encounter amino-acid or carbon-starvation [26]. The stringent response is induced by
accumulation of the ‘alarmone’ guanosine tetra/penta
phosphate ((p)ppGpp), e.g. in response to low concentrations of amino-acylated tRNAs [26]. We thus wanted to
investigate this possible link to (p)ppGpp signaling more
closely, and asked whether the changes in cell homeostastis upon YgjD depletion are mediated through (p)ppGpp.

Figure 4 The change in cell size homeostasis in response to
YgjD depletion depends on (p)ppGpp. A) Changes in cell
elongation rate and the interval between two divisions during YgjD
depletion, for TB80 (ppGpp+) and TB84 (ppGpp0). For each strain,
means and standard errors of three independent experiments are
shown. In TB80, cell elongation rate starts to decrease after
generation 3, and cells divide before they double in size. In TB84,
cell division occurs close to the moment of cell size doubling (the
means are close to the contour line of constant cell size). B)
Change of mean cell size during YgjD depletion, for and TB80
(ppGpp+) and TB84 (ppGpp-). In TB80, cell size starts to decrease
after generation 3, as a consequence of cell division that occurs
before cells double in size (see panel A). In TB84, cell size decreases
only slightly, and then increases after generation 5, when cells
divide after the moment of cell doubling (see panel A).

final cell length of depleted (p)ppGpp0 cells (TB84) was
on average twice that of depleted (p)ppGpp+ cells (TB80)
(Figure 4b). This is reminiscent of the elongated cells
found in populations of cells depleted for YgjD by Handford and colleagues [3].
This suggests that the changes in cell size in response
to YgjD depletion are mediated through the alarmone

Bergmiller et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:118
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/118

(p)ppGpp; an alternative explanation is that the absence
of (p)ppGpp leads to cell elongation (as has been previously reported [27]), and that this elongation compensates indirectly for reductive fission upon YgjD
depletion. Importantly, TB84 cells still ceased cell division (Additional file 15 - Figure S6). Thus, ygjD is still
essential even in the absence of (p)ppGpp, and termination of cell division is not solely a consequence of a
diminished cellular growth rate.
To further test the idea that ygjD depletion triggers (p)
ppGpp synthesis we measured, on a single cell level during YgjD depletion, the activity of two promoters known
to respond to the intracellular level of (p)ppGpp: Papt is
repressed by (p)ppGpp, while P rsd is induced by (p)
ppGpp [28]. We transformed TB84 with plasmids carrying transcriptional promoter-gfp fusions [29] encoding
P apt -gfp and P rsd -gfp, and measured gene expression
from these promoters as fluorescence intensity over
consecutive cell divisions. The level of GFP expression
steadily decreased in the strains where gfp was controlled by Papt (Figure 5a), and steadily increased when
controlled by Prsd (Figure 5c). Furthermore, this change
in fluorescence was tightly linked to the rate by which
cells elongated (Figure 5b and 5d). When the same
strains were grown on L-arabinose containing medium
no consistent changes of fluorescence could be observed
(Additional file 16 - Figure S7). These observations are
consistent with the scenario that YgjD depletion induces
(p)ppGpp synthesis, and thus influences promoters
whose expression depends on the levels of (p)ppGpp.
Single cell analysis indicated that, in the cells depleted
for YgjD, there is a link between decreased cell elongation rate and (p)ppGpp levels. Using independent comparisons between sister cells in the microcolonies
undergoing YjgD depletion, we found that if a cell had a
lower elongation rate than its sister, it also tended to
have lower levels of GFP expressed from P apt (details
not shown; for Prsd-gfp, this pattern was not observed).
These data support the idea that the link between (p)
ppGpp levels and the cell elongation rate is direct; for
example, it is possible that high levels of (p)ppGpp
cause low elongation rates [30].
Our results suggest further that YgjD depletion has
two (possibly linked) effects: first, depletion triggers (p)
ppGpp synthesis. Second, it leads to termination of cell
division. To gain insights in which phase of the cell
cycle YgjD-depleted cells are arrested we visualized the
DNA-content of individual cells with DNA-staining and
subsequent fluorescence microscopy (Additional File 17
- Figure S8). After YgjD depletion in (p)ppGpp + cells
(TB80), DNA was localized at midcell and filled large
areas of the cell (Additional File 17 - Figure S8 b), possibly indicating that cells were unable to carry out additional cell divisions due to “nucleoid occlusion” [31].

Page 7 of 12

This mechanism prevents premature cell division before
chromosomes have been distributed to opposite cell
halves. However, termination of cell division also manifests in a (p)ppGpp0 strain (Additional File 17 - Figure
S8 c): depleted cells were elongated, and only a small
fraction of the cell volume was filled with DNA. Thus,
in the (p)ppGpp0 background, nucleoid occlusion alone
cannot be responsible for termination of cell division.
The elongated phenotype of YgjD depleted (p)ppGpp0
cells resembles filamentous cells blocked in cell division.
However, since abrogating cell division is not inhibiting
DNA replication or DNA segregation [32] it appears
unlikely that YgjD directly affects cell division.

Conclusions
Our results show that single cell experiments coupled
with statistical analysis can uncover phenotypic transitions that come about when an essential gene is
depleted. We captured phenotypic changes with high
temporal resolution across several cell generations. Cell
tracking techniques allowed us to build lineages of cells,
and to analyze correlations between phenotypic traits at
the level of sister cells emerging from the same division.
This information can be used to describe growth transitions on the cellular level.
We found that YgjD depletion has two, possibly
linked, effects: a decrease in cell size that is accompanied by accumulation of (p)ppGpp, and the arrest of cell
division. The involvement of (p)ppGpp in the alteration
of cell size homeostasis under YgjD depletion conditions
might explain the discrepancies between two studies ([3]
and [17]) that observed opposite effects on cell size
upon YgjD depletion. Katz et al. [17] used a relA+ spoT+
strain that is very similar to the ppGpp + strain TB80
used here, and - consistent with our findings - observed
shorter cells upon YgjD depletion. In contrast the
MC4100 derivative that was used by Handford and colleagues [3] carries a relA1 allele. This allele is known to
cause reduced cellular (p)ppGpp levels under certain
growth conditions [26,33]. Thus, their finding of elongated cells upon YgjD depletion might be similar to
what we observed with the ppGpp0 strain TB84.
Our observations seem consistent with the finding
that ygjD is involved in forming transfer-RNA base
modifications [8]. Thus, depletion of YgjD protein leads
to a pool of un- or undermodified transfer-RNAs (as
described by [8]), possibly resulting in non-optimal
interactions between transfer-RNAs and mRNA inside
the ribosome. This could potentially elicit a stringentresponse like program (governed by (p)ppGpp release)
and explain the phenotypic consequences of YgjD depletion that we observed. Non-optimal interactions
between non-modified tRNAs and mRNA could be
similar to the effects caused by ribosomes that are

Figure 5 Expression of Papt and Prsd during YgjD depletion. Single cell measurements of cell elongation rate and GFP fluorescence of two
strains with transcriptional reporters for Papt (A and B) and Prsd (C and D). Each point represents a measurement for a single cell. In both strains,
cell elongation rate decreased with increasing generations during YgjD depletion as shown in Figures 1B and 2A. A) and B) Papt is repressed by
(p)ppGpp; its expression decreases during YgjD depletion, and decreases steadily with decreasing cell elongation rate. C) and D) Prsd is induced
by (p)ppGpp; its expression increases during YgjD depletion, and steadily increases with decreasing cell elongation rate.

stalled on “hungry” codons: these codons are unsuccessfully trying to pair with either rare transfer-RNAs or
transfer-RNAs that are non-aminoacylated due to
amino-acid limitation. Hungry codons can provoke the
production of aberrant proteins by frame shifts, slides of
the translational machinery or incorporation of noncognate transfer-RNAs [34,35]. This might also explain the
slow onset of the consequences of YgjD depletion: accumulation of aberrant proteins would slowly increase

over time and reach a level where several cellular processes might be affected simultaneously.
Although the biochemical activity of YgjD has been
described [8], the cellular functions of YgjD are not
completely resolved. It will be interesting to ask how the
proteins in the YgjD/YeaZ/YjeE complex [3] of Escherichia coli are interacting to fulfill their functions, and to
ask whether YgjD is involved in other cellular processes
or responding to environmental cues. Single-cell

observations of YgjD depletion experiments might be
helpful to generate and test hypotheses about the essential role of this protein, and to help explain why it is so
widely conserved.

Methods
Bacterial strains and growth medium

P1 transduction and TSS transformation were performed as described elsewhere [36,37]. Strain DY330 as
well as strains harboring the plasmid pCP20 [38] were
grown at 32°. All other strains were grown at 37°. To
grow TB80 and TB84 under permissive conditions, we
used LB medium (Sigma) supplemented with 0.1%
(batch culture) or 0.01% (before time-lapse microscopy)
L-arabinose (Sigma). LB agar (1.5% agar) was from
Sigma, and used for preparing agar plates and agar pads
for time-lapse microscopy.
Strain construction

Strains containing more than one knockout or marker
were generated by sequential P1-transductions. Resistance markers were removed by Flp recombinase
mediated site-specific recombination [39]. To control
expression of ygjD, we constructed a conditional mutant
with a second copy of the promoter of the araBAD
operon in front of the native chromosomal locus of ygjD
by directly inserting a Para-construct in front of ygjD, as
described previously [40]. Removal of L-arabinose and
addition of glucose allows tight repression of target
genes under control of Para [40,41].
We closely followed the description of [40] and first
constructed a strain in which a kanamycin resistance
cassette is linked to the promoter of araBAD. We
inserted such a kanamycin marker downstream of araC
with the following primers:
5’_araC_yabI_insert
AATCAGACAATTGACGGCTTGACGGAGTAGCATAGGGTTTTGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC;
3’_araC_yabI_insert
GCATAATGTGCCTGTCAAATGGACGAAGCAGGGATTCTGCCATATGAATA
TCCTCCTTAGTTCCTAT.
The insertion was done in DY330 following the protocol described by [42], verified by PCR and moved to
MG1655 by P1 transduction, thus generating TB55.
TB55 was subsequently used to generate a PCR product
that spanned the kanamycin cassette adjacent to araC,
araC, the full intergenic region between araC and araB,
and 42 basepairs at the 5’ and 3’ -prime ends that were
homologous to the upstream and 5’-coding region of ygjD,
dnaT ,fldA or ffh. The sequence of the primers was

DY330 cells were grown in LB medium supplemented
with 0.2% L-arabinose and made electro- and recombination competent [42], and electroporated with the above
described PCR product. After electroporation, cells were
transferred to LB medium containing 0.1% L-arabinose
and incubated at 32° for 1.5 hours prior to plating on LB
plates agar containing L-arabinose (0.1%) and kanamycin
(50 μg/ml, Sigma). Clones were checked on LB agar
plates supplemented with 0.4% glucose to confirm that
they were unable to grow in the presence of glucose.
The promoter fusions and the adjacent araC gene
were verified by sequencing with the following primers:
araC_FW GCTACTCCGTCAAGCCGTCA;
ygjD_RW GGCAATTGGTCTGGGGAGCA.
dnaTC_RW AGAGTTGATCGTCCAGAGCG
ffh_RW ATTTTGACGAACTCCTGCCC
fldA_RW CGAGAGTCGGGAAGAAGTCA
The constructs were then moved by P1 transduction
into MG1655. To construct TB80 the kanamycin cassette was removed with pCP20.
The knockout ΔrelA::kan was derived from the KEIO
library clone JW2755 [2] and P1-transduced into TB82.
ΔspoT::kan was introduced using AB1058) as donor
strain for P1 transduction.
To measure activity of the promoters Para, Prsd and Papt,
MG1655 and TB80 were transformed [37] with plasmids
that contain transcriptional promoter-gfp fusions [29].
Microscopy

LB agar pads were prepared by filling a cavity of a sterile
microscope cavity slide with a drop of freshly melted LB

Bergmiller et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:118
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/118

agar, and covering it with a cover slip to attain a flat surface. The cavity slide was transferred to a fridge for a
short time to allow the agar to solidify. Upon removal of
the cover slip and removal of excess LB agar, the pads
can be inoculated with precultured cells as described in
the next paragraph.
TB80 and TB84 were cultured over night at 37° in LB
medium with 0.1% L-arabinose and diluted 1:100 into
fresh LB medium containing 0.01% L-arabinose. In early
exponential phase, cultures were washed at least twice
in LB supplemented with 0.4% glucose to remove residual L-arabinose. Wildtype E. coli MG1655 was treated
similar for control experiments. 1.5 μl of a washed and
diluted culture were transferred to the surface of a pad
of LB agar (supplemented with D-glucose, L-arabinose,
chloramphenicol or kanamycin as indicated for individual experiments) in a microscope cavity slide. The agar
pad was closed with a cover slip and sealed with
vacuum grease. Under these conditions, cells can grow
exponentially in a two-dimensional plane for many generations without restrictions [23]. The slide was
mounted onto an automated microscope (Olympus
BX81) and incubated at 37°C (Cube and Box incubation
system, Life Imaging Services, Reinach, Switzerland).
Images were recorded every 2 or 4 minutes. Intensity
and exposure times to fluorescent light were minimized
to avoid cellular damage. The resulting image sequences
were analyzed with the Matlab based script package
“Schnitzcell” (kindly provided by Michael Elowitz, CalTech, USA [18]), and data was extracted with custommade Matlab scripts (Table 1).
Statistical analysis

To quantify associations between phenotypic traits, we
used non-parametric correlation analysis (Spearman’s
rank correlation in PASW Statistics 18.0).

movies hereafter).
Additional File 2: Movie 2: MG1655 growing on LB agar with 0.4%

10 seconds.
Additional File 3: Figure S1: MG1655 expressing GFP from Para
shifted from LB arabinose 0.01% to LB glucose 0.4%. This
experiment was performed with the wild type strain MG1655 carrying a
plasmid encoding a transcriptional fusion of gfp to Para [29]. The strain
was grown in 0.01% arabinose, analogously to the depletion experiments
with TB80 and TB84, washed in LB supplemented with glucose and
transferred onto an agar pad consisting of LB agar with 0.4% glucose.
The level of GFP fluorescence decreased rapidly and approached the
level of background fluorescence when cells reached generation 4.
Additional File 4: Movie 3. TB80 (ppGpp+) growing on LB agar with
0.4% glucose. 150 frames (one frame per two minutes) were

compressed into 15 seconds. This movie was used to extract the growth
dynamics shown in Figure 2 and 3.
Additional File 5: Figure S2: Lineage trees of microcolonies of A)
MG1655 growth and B) YgjD depletion. After tracking of individual
cells across recorded images with “Schnitzcell”, the lineage structure of a
microcolony can be derived. In such a lineage tree, the branch length
corresponds to the time interval between divisions, and division events
occur at branching points. The different colors depict the color code
used for cells from different generations throughout all figures. The dots
at the end of individual branches represent the time points where
individual physiological measurements (cell size and fluorescent intensity)
were derived from.
Additional File 6: Figure S3: Depletion of essential genes induces
unique phenotypes. Time-lapse experiments of cells depleting for fldA,
ffh and dnaT (see Additional Files 7, 8 and 9 - movies 4, 5 and 6) were
tracked, and the cell size at division over consecutive divisions was
plotted.
Additional File 7: movie 4: Depletion of FldA from growing cells. A
Para-fldA conditional lethal mutant was shifted from 0.1% arabinose to an
agar pad with 0.4% glucose. FldA is essential for isoprenoid biosynthesis
[44], and as the movie shows, depletion of FldA leads to lysis of cells. 80
frames (one frame per four minutes) were compressed into 8 seconds.
Additional File 8: movie 5: Depletion of Ffh from growing cells. A
Para-ffh conditional lethal mutant was shifted from 0.1% arabinose to an
agar pad with 0.4% glucose. Ffh protein is part of the signal recognition
particle translocation system, that cotranslationaly sequesters proteins
into or across the cytoplasmic membrane [45]. Depletion resulted in
visible intracellular aggregates, followed by elongation and cell lysis. 120
frames (one frame per two minutes) were compressed into 12 seconds.
Additional File 9: movie 6: Depletion of DnaT from growing cells. A
Para-dnaT conditional lethal mutant was shifted from 0.01% arabinose to
a 0.4% glucose containing agar pad. Depletion resulted in filament
formation, which is in agreement with “unbalanced” growth upon
abrogation of DNA replication. dnaT (and the following gene dnaC) is
part of the “primosome” and is crucial for initiation of DNA replication.
100 frames (one frame per four minutes) were compressed into 10
seconds.
Additional File 10: Figure S4: Effects of minimum inhibitory
concentrations (MIC) of chloramphenicol and kanamycin on growth
of E. coli MG1655. Recorded image series of E.coli MG1655 growing on
MIC concentrations of chloramphenicol (2.5 μg/ml) and kanamycin (5
μg/ml) (see Additional Files 11 and 12 - movies 7 and 8) were tracked,
and the cell size over consecutive division was plotted.
Additional File 11: movie 7: Growth of E. coli MG1655 on 2.5 μg/ml
chloramphenicol. E. coli MG1655 was precultured in LB medium and
transferred to an agar pad containing 2.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. 100
frames (one frame per four minutes) were compressed into 10 seconds,.
Additional File 12: movie 8: Growth of E. coli MG1655 on 5 μg/ml
kanamycin. E. coli MG1655 was precultured in LB medium and
transferred to an agar pad containing 5 μg/ml kanamycin. 60 frames
(one frame per four minutes) were compressed into 6 seconds.
Additional File 13: Figure S5: Coupling of cell elongation rate and
interval between division across multiple experiments. The pattern
observed in Figure 3 is repeatable and consistent across independent
experiments. Non-parametric correlation analysis for the differences
between sisters in these two traits was performed for seven independent
microcolonies (YgjD depletion in TB80), and the median and the range
of the correlation coefficients is reported; the median correlation
coefficients are negative from generation 3 on, indicating a coupling
between cell elongation rate and the interval between two divisions.
Additional File 14: Movie 9. TB84 (ppGpp0) growing on LB agar
with 0.4% glucose. 200 frames (one frame per two minutes) were
compressed into 20 seconds.
Additional File 15: Figure S6: YgjD is also essential in absence of (p)

presence of glucose, leading to YgjD depletion. Cell division terminates
after about five to six divisions.

TB80 grown with 0.1% arabinose to induce YgjD expression. B) TB80
grown with 0.4% glucose, leading to YgjD depletion. Cells are small, and
the DNA stain occupies a large fraction of the cell area. C) TB84 grown
with 0.4% glucose, leading to YgjD depletion. Cells are elongated, and
the DNA stain only occupies a small fraction of the cell area.
