Abstract
Background: Bacteriophages are an important repository of genetic diversity. As one of the
major constituents of terrestrial biomass, they exert profound effects on the earth's ecology and
microbial evolution by mediating horizontal gene transfer between bacteria and controlling their
growth. Only limited genomic sequence data are currently available for phages but even this reveals
an overwhelming diversity in their gene sequences and genomes. The contribution of the T4-like
phages to this overall phage diversity is difficult to assess, since only a few examples of complete
genome sequence exist for these phages. Our analysis of five T4-like genomes represents half of
the known T4-like genomes in GenBank.
Results: Here, we have examined in detail the genetic diversity of the genomes of five relatives of
bacteriophage T4: the Escherichia coli phages RB43, RB49 and RB69, the Aeromonas salmonicida
phage 44RR2.8t (or 44RR) and the Aeromonas hydrophila phage Aeh1. Our data define a core set of
conserved genes common to these genomes as well as hundreds of additional open reading frames
(ORFs) that are nonconserved. Although some of these ORFs resemble known genes from
bacterial hosts or other phages, most show no significant similarity to any known sequence in the
databases. The five genomes analyzed here all have similarities in gene regulation to T4. Sequence
motifs resembling T4 early and late consensus promoters were observed in all five genomes. In
contrast, only two of these genomes, RB69 and 44RR, showed similarities to T4 middle-mode
promoter sequences and to the T4 motA gene product required for their recognition. In addition,
we observed that each phage differed in the number and assortment of putative genes encoding
host-like metabolic enzymes, tRNA species, and homing endonucleases.
Conclusion: Our observations suggest that evolution of the T4-like phages has drawn on a highly
diverged pool of genes in the microbial world. The T4-like phages harbour a wealth of genetic
material that has not been identified previously. The mechanisms by which these genes may have
arisen may differ from those previously proposed for the evolution of other bacteriophage
genomes.

Background
The T4-like phages are a diverse group of lytic bacterial
myoviruses that share genetic homologies and morphological similarities with the well-studied coliphage T4
[1,2]. These phages provide an attractive model for the
study of comparative genomics and phage evolution for
several reasons: They possess relatively large dsDNA
genomes that vary widely in size (~160–250 kb) and
genetic composition. They contain host-like functions,
such as nucleotide metabolism and a DNA replisome
(reviewed in [3]). They experience different evolutionary
constraints due to their lytic life cycle than do either their
bacterial host or lysogenic bacteriophages. They exist
under less stringent genomic size constraints than, for
example, the lambdoid phages [4]. T4 has a terminally
redundant genome [5] that replicates by a recombinationprimed replication pathway. The efficient and promiscuous T4-encoded recombination machinery [6] may generate a high degree of evolutionary diversity, via both
homologous and non-homologous recombination
between this phage genome and that of bacterial hosts or
other phages. Thus the characteristics of the T4-like
genome, its mechanism of replication, and the interactions with cellular hosts suggest that the T4-like phages
constitute a natural crucible for the acquisition, evolution
and dispersal of genetic information in the microbial
world.
We present here a bioinformatics analysis of the genome
sequences of five T4-like bacteriophages. These phages
include three coliphages (RB69, RB49 and RB43), and two
Aeromonas phages (44RR2.8t and Aeh1). Our results complement and extend those previously reported from the
coliphage T4 [3], the Vibrio phage, KVP40 [7], and from
the marine cyanophages S-PM2 [8], P-SSM2 and P-SSM4
[9]. Our data identify a conserved core of T4-like genes
found in all of these genomes, including some conserved
ORFs of unknown function. One of the most striking findings is the presence of large numbers of novel open reading frames (ORFs), most of which have no significant
match in GenBank. Both conserved and nonconserved
regions of the genomes include sequence motifs resembling T4 promoters. Thus, it appears that both core and
novel genes are co-ordinately expressed in a manner similar to that of T4. We compare the possible origins of the
novel regions of the T4 genome with those proposed for
other phages.

like genomes. Of these sequences, five genomes were
selected for in depth analysis on the basis of their phylogenetically diversity [10]. Among completed genomes
that are not dealt with here are the Aeromonas phages 31
and 25, since they are both close relatives of 44RR2.8t and
thus do not add significantly to the sequence diversity of
the group. Five other genomes are considered draft quality
(coliphages RB16 and phi-1, Vibrio phage nt-1, Acinetobacter phage 133, and Aeromonas phage 65) and are not
included in this analysis but are available through the
Tulane
T4-like
Genome
Website
http://
phage.bioc.tulane.edu. The five genomes presented here
share between 61 and 67 percent amino acid similarity to
each other among ~100 conserved open reading frames.
T4 is most closely related to RB69, with which it shares
81% amino acid similarity over 207 ORFs. T4 exhibits
about the same level of similarity to the other 4 genomes
as they do to each other.
A summary of this analysis is presented in Table 1. The
sizes of these five genomes range between 164 kb and 233
kb. The genome of Aeh1 had been predicted to be significantly larger than the other genomes, based on pulse field
gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA [10]. This genome
(233234 bp) is in fact nearly 40% larger than the average
of T4 and the other four genomes presented here; the
genomes of KVP40 [7] and P-SSM2 [9] are larger still (244
kb and 252 kb, respectively). All genomes have low %GC,
although to a lesser degree than T4. ORFs were identified
using GeneMarkS [11,12] and ORFs orthologous to T4
genes were identified by blastp mutual best hits to predicted proteins in the GenBank accession for the T4
genome. The probable significance of matches was
assessed by expected value (E-value) scores. Most ORFs
scored well below the 10-4 cutoff for significant matches.
A conserved core of 82 ORFs (T4-like genes) was found in
all 5 genomes analysed here. There are 106 T4-like genes
conserved among at least 4 of these 5 genomes; Aeh1
shared the fewest of these conserved genes (94) and the
average similarity of the T4 orthologs of the conserved
genes was lowest in this phage as well (49%). The conserved genes are generally clustered in several large blocks
throughout each genome. Interspersed between these
conserved blocks are segments containing blocks of predicted novel ORFs, most of which are unique to the
genome that harbours them. Novel ORFs represent
between 20% and 54% of the total coding capacity of the
5 genomes analyzed.

Results
Genome overview
We have analyzed five complete genome sequences of
phylogenetically distant T4-like bacteriophages. This analysis is the first part of an ongoing comparative genomics
project on T4-like phages. At present this project has generated single contiguous sequences for 12 divergent T4-

Conserved genes and ORFs
The conserved genes are generally localized in large clusters. The gene order among the clusters is highly collinear
between most phages, as depicted in Figure 1: a higher resolution version is also available (see additional file 1). In
T4, early and middle expressed genes are transcribed in a

The number of ORFs for T4 is from the GenBank accession but does not include 7 alternative translation products included within some ORFs. The
number of ORFs predicted for T4 by GeneMarkS was 266 (93.1% of the genome length). tRNAs were predicted by tRNAscan-SE. The number of
T4-like ORFs is the number of ORFs conserved in T4 and at least one of the other genomes studied. The remainder of ORFs in each genome are

map), while late genes are primarily transcribed in the
opposite direction. The genomes of RB69, RB49, and
44RR display a high degree of synteny with T4 and maintain essentially all of the clustering of related genes seen in
T4. Synteny with T4 conserves the gene orientation with
respect to time of expression during the infectious cycle.
The genome of Aeh1 is also syntenous with T4, although
small rearrangements of individual genes can be seen in
Figure 1. Only RB43, with at least two substantial genome
rearrangements, displays a significant break in synteny
with T4 and the other T4-like phage genomes. The pre-

DNA replication

dicted transcription pattern appears more complex for
RB43, with smaller clusters of genes predicted to be cotranscribed and some orthologs of T4 early and middle
genes are transcribed from the opposite strand used in T4
[13]. A discussion of genes conserved in all T4-like phages
can be found in a companion manuscript [13], as well as
an earlier work [9].
The T4 genome has 132 predicted ORFs of unknown function. Eleven of these ORFs are conserved among the five
T4-like genomes and orthologs to 93 T4 ORFs are found
in at least one of these genomes. Although the conserved

ORFs were not identified as essential in T4 by genetic
methods [14], their preservation among phages suggests
that they must be advantageous for survival in nature. In
most instances the functions provided by these conserved
ORFs remains obscure, but matches to Pfam motifs provide some clues about the function for a few of these
ORFs, as shown in Table 2. For example, ORF vs.6 has a
highly significant match to the Gly_radical Pfam accession, which is also found in the nrdD anaerobic nucleotide reductase. Thus, the vs.6 gene product may play a role
in phage-induced nucleotide metabolism. Another conserved ORF, vs.1, exhibits marginally significant similarity
to the SLT lytic transglycosylase domain, suggesting some
role in cell lysis. These results corroborate PSI-BLAST
matches previously reported for the T4 vs.1 and vs.6 ORFs
to lysozyme and glycyl radical domains [15]. Overall, the
match of vs.1 to the SLT domain is conserved; four of the
six phage vs.1 orthologs match SLT with E value <0.05 and
the other two orthologs match more marginally, with E<
0.75. The nrdC.10 ORF is conserved in 3 of 6 phages, and
all 3 of these match the AAA ATPase motif, with E values
ranging from 0.082 to 0.16. Another conserved ORF, 5.4,
displays a less probable, although conserved, match to the
PAAR membrane associated motif. However, such low
probability matches must be interpreted with caution, but
they could provide starting points for the identification of
the functions for conserved proteins. Functional assignments for vs.1, vs.6, and nrdC.10 were corroborated by
BLAST matches to the Conserved Domain database [16].
In addition, Conserved Domain BLAST searches identified matches for 4 of 6 tk.4 orthologs to the A1pp phosphatase domain and 5 of 6 nrdC.11 orthologs to the
COG3541 nucleotidyltransferase domain.
Only recently has the conserved ORF uvsW.1 been recognized [17] in T4. Previously this sequence was believed to
encode the C-terminal 76 amino acids of the UvsW protein. For all 5 of the genomes analyzed here, the coding
region corresponding to T4 uvsW was divided into 2
ORFs, uvsW and uvsW.1. Concurrent crystallography on

the UvsW protein from T4, showed that it too lacked the
region similar to uvsW.1 and subsequent resequencing of
this region in T4 confirmed the presence of the two distinct ORFs, uvsW.1 and uvsW [17]. Although uvsW.1 is
conserved among T4 and all 5 genomes studied here, its
function remains unknown.
Novel ORFS
Each phage genome includes a surprisingly large number
of ORFs that have no matches in T4. We term these ORFs
"novel ORFs" and their numbers range from 230 in Aeh1
(54% of the genome) to 62 (20% of the genome) in RB69.
Similarly, 64 T4 ORFs (15% of the genome) have no
apparent ortholog in RB69, its closest relative in this analysis; these 64 ORFs are novel to T4 (see Table 1). Locations
of the novel ORFs appear to be non-random, with most
clustered in groups between blocks of conserved genes. In
a few instances, however novel ORFs are found singly
between conserved genes (see Figure 1). The direction of
transcription of the novel ORFs is almost invariably the
same as flanking conserved genes. This suggests that the
novel ORFs are subject to the same regulatory constraints
as the rest of the phage genome, with early expressed
genes being transcribed primarily counterclockwise and
late genes being transcribed clockwise. Nearly 90% of the
novel ORFs are clustered among early and middle gene
orthologs, suggesting that these genes are expressed at the
beginning of the infectious cycle, along with the flanking
conserved genes (see also below). The novel ORFs do not
appear to differ significantly in codon bias from conserved genes. They share the same strand bias of the third
codon position seen in T4 [18] and do not vary significantly in codon adaptation index [19] from conserved
genes (data not shown). These observations argue that the
novel ORFs are not recent acquisitions of host genes.

We searched the sequences of novel ORFs for matches to
phage genomes and the Swissprot database by using
blastp, and Pfam motifs (HMMer). We identified a total of
750 ORFs from the 5 genomes that lacked T4 orthologs.

Of these, only 64 showed matches to Pfam functional
domains (Table 3) or to proteins of known function in
GenBank. Although novel ORFs are not orthologs of T4like genes, some appear to be paralogous duplications of
adjacent, conserved genes, such as RB69ORF010c with
motB, and RB49ORF183c, 44RRORF188c and T4 ORFs alt.1 alt.-2, with alt. An additional ORF, 44RRORF187c,
appears to be a full-length duplication of alt, but displays
only 54% similarity to 44RR alt. Although none of the
remaining novel ORFs showed any similarity to T4, 89 of
them matched other novel ORFs from one of the other
five T4-like genomes in this study. A subset of ORFs in
phages 44RR, Aeh1, and RB43 appear to be orthologs of a
pyrimidine salvage pathway, previously described in the
T4-like phage KVP40 [7]. This pathway includes an
NAPRTase and a bifunctional NUDIX hydrolase/nucleotidyl transferase, which is distinct from the monofunctional
NUDIX hydrolase, nudE, found in T4 [20]; nudE orthologs
were also predicted for Aeh1, RB43 and RB69. It thus
appears that Aeh1 and RB43 possess both the bifunctional
NUDIX protein and the T4-like monofunctional NudE
protein. It is unclear whether these observations reflect a
functional redundancy for RB43 and Aeh1, or if nudE and
the bifunctional NUDIX/transferase provide different
functions in the phage-infected cell. Conversely, RB49
does not appear to encode either nudE or the bifunctional
NUDIX protein.
Several other novel ORFs may be involved in nucleotide
modification and synthesis. These include DNA methylase, nucleotidyl transferase, nucleotide triphosphatase
and sugar isomerase domain functions identified by Pfam
matches. In addition, phylogenetic analyses suggest that
phage 44RR appears to have acquired ribonucleotide
reductase and thioredoxin genes from a bacterial host,
rather than through conservation of the T4-like orthologs
[13]. A number of the predicted ORFs likely to be involved
in gene regulation were also identified, including DNA
binding proteins, polyADP-ribosylases and -hydrolases,
DNA helicases, an excision repair endonuclease and homing endonucleases, as indicated in Table 3. Other putative
functions identified include membrane proteins, peptidases, ATPases, an exotoxin, and a putative DnaJ-type protein chaperone. Several ORFs that do not match known
genes in GenBank do match GenBank environmental
sample sequences. It is unclear if these matches are to
uncharacterized bacterial hosts, or to unknown bacteriophages.
All ORFs were also searched for matches to signal peptide
[21] and transmembrane motifs [22]. Tables of ORFs
matching these motifs for each genome are available (see
additional file 2).

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/30

Mobile DNA elements
The T4 genome encodes a number of mobile DNA elements, including 3 group I introns with integrated ORFs
encoding homing endonucleases as well as the freestanding homing endonucleases genes (HEGs), mob and seg [3].
No group I introns were detected among any of the T4-like
genomes sequenced here. However, two ORFs bearing
similarity to the mob genes of T4 were identified in Aeh1
and RB43. An ORF similar to T4 segD has also been
described for KVP40 [7]. Thus, T4 seems to carry many
more mobile elements than the genomes analyzed here.
Interestingly, both RB49 and RB43 exhibit matches to a
recently identified class of HEGs, AP2-HNH mobile DNA
elements, which are related to the AP2 DNA transcription
factor in plants [23] (also see [13]). This class of HEGs has
been postulated to have transferred from bacteriophages
into plant genomes via the chloroplast genome [23].
Putative signals for transcriptional regulation
The similarities of genome organization to T4 suggested
that T4 transcriptional regulatory circuits might be conserved for many T4-like phages in nature. However,
phages 44RR and Aeh1 replicate in different hosts than T4
and coliphage RB43 has a substantially rearranged
genome compared to the T4 prototype. The relevance of
these differences to gene regulation was analyzed by prediction of transcriptional promoter elements in each
genome. Consensus nucleotide sequences have been
described for three temporal classes of promoters in T4:
genes expressed early, middle and late in the infectious
cycle [3]. Each of the five T4-like genomes was searched
for matches to these T4 transcriptional regulatory signals.
Early promoters
The T4 early promoter consensus [3] was used as a start
point for identifying sequence similarities in the 5 T4-like
genomes using the string search program fuzznuc [24].
Matching sequences were scrutinized for their locations
relative to the predicted translation initiation site of putative early genes or other ORFs. These sequences were then
used in an iterative fashion to find additional sequences
using the HMMer program, which develops a statistical
model for the consensus with which more refined
searches of the genome can be done. Successive rounds of
sequence selection and refinement were done until the
number and locations of the sequences found ceased to
change. From this analysis, we derived an early gene promoter motif for each phage. The locations of the final set
of putative promoters on the genome were then manually
examined. In virtually all cases, putative promoter elements were identified 5' to a predicted translational start
site for a predicted ORF or conserved gene and in the correct orientation for transcription of this ORF. Thus, the
predicted promoters appear to be plausible transcription
initiation sequences. In each case, the sequences of the

Predicted ORF protein sequences were used to search Pfam using HMMer. Matches with E < 0.5 are shown. Multiple matches are shown for ORFs
having non-overlapping matches to more than one domain.

presumed early promoters thus identified had similarities
to the T4 early consensus, but with some distinct differences that are illustrated in Figure 2. All predicted early
promoters had similarity in the -35 region sequence to the
GTTTAC sequence (-36 to -31) found in T4 [3], but in
RB49, RB43 and Aeh1 there was a definite preference for
G rather than T at position -33. In T4, this position is
believed to be a preferred site of interaction of the ADPribosylated alpha subunit of RNA polymerase; a modification that is made in this subunit by the T4 encoded Alt
protein [25]. Phages RB49 and Aeh1 have putative alt
genes, but in both cases the predicted Alt protein
sequences are considerably diverged from the T4 sequence
(data not shown); RB43 apparently lacks an alt ortholog.
Position -36 is a strongly conserved G in some of the

genomes analyzed but for RB43 it can be G or C; Aeh1
shows even less sequence conservation in the -36 position. All the phages frequently have an A-rich sequence
from -40 to -44. This region resembles the UP element,
which enhances transcription and is a site of interaction
with the T4 ADP-ribosylated alpha subunit of RNA
polymerase [26-28].
All putative early promoters resemble the T4 consensus in
the -10 region, which is recognized in the host by the σ
subunit of RNA polymerase. In general, there is high conservation of T at position -7 and A residues at position -11,
as seen in T4. However, in our phage conservation of the
T at position -12 is variable; T is not rigidly conserved at
position -12 in Aeh1, and in RB49 it can be either T or C.

There is variable conservation of the GT-rich sequence 5'
to position -12 exhibited by T4. 44RR shows a higher
degree of conservation of A at -8 than any of the other
phages. The genomes of RB69, RB49, and 44RR all show
preference for C residues in the -3 to -1 region. The predicted RB49 early consensus agrees with that previously
identified by 5' end mapping of RB49 early transcripts
[29].
When the sites of predicted early promoters were mapped
onto their respective genomes, many promoters were
located 5' to orthologs of T4 early genes, as expected.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/30

Importantly, a large number of early promoters were predicted 5' to novel ORFs, including those for which no
homologs exist in the sequence databases. For example, of
57 putative early promoters in RB69, 13 were upstream of
novel ORFs and 45 were upstream of T4 orthologs (see
example in Figure 3). These observations suggest that
many novel ORFs are coordinately regulated along with
the flanking conserved early T4-like genes. Early promoters were also found 5' to the tRNA genes, described below.
Coordinates of putative early promoters can be found in
the supplements (see additional file 3).

Middle promoters
In the T4 infectious cycle, early transcription is followed
by "middle mode" transcription, which is initiated by the
binding of the phage-encoded MotA protein to its cognate
recognition sequence at T4 middle promoters [30-32]. We
used two criteria to attempt to detect conserved elements
of T4-like middle mode transcriptional regulation among
the five genomes studied: (a) matches to the T4 middle
promoter consensus [33] and (b), matches to the T4 MotA
protein sequence. The RB69 genome includes a motA
ortholog (blastp E = 5X10-48). Putative RB69 middle promoter sequences were identified using a similar strategy to
that described for early promoters, but based upon the
consensus sequence, (a/t)(a/t)(a/t) TGCTTtAN(11–
13)TataAT [33] The RB69 middle consensus clearly resembles that of T4 (Figure 4A); with conservation of the residues at positions -12, -11, and -7 of the T4 consensus.

Also, the putative RB69 middle genes exhibit extended
conserved sequences from positions -13 to -16, as seen in
T4. T4 middle promoters show little similarity to the -35
region of E. coli σ70 promoters, but do possess the highly
conserved GCTT motif (the T4 Mot box) at positions -30
to -27. This motif serves as the site of interaction of the T4
MotA protein with DNA. RB69 middle promoters also
show similarity to the Mot box, which is presumably
bound by the RB69 MotA ortholog. However, among the
4 other genomes studied, only the 44RR genome had an
ortholog to the T4 MotA protein and sequence motifs similar to the T4 MotA-dependent promoters. Nine putative
44RR middle promoters were identified. They resemble
the middle-mode consensus sequences of both T4 and
RB69, but lack conservation at nucleotide position -11
(Figure 4A). The relatively small number of putative middle-promoters that we have detected in 44RR tempers the

interpretation of their significance. However, the presence
of a strong match (blastp E = 2X10-33) to the T4 motA gene
function in this Aeromonas phage is probably indicative of
the presence of a 44RR-encoded middle-mode transcriptional apparatus. Previous attempts to identify a middle
promoter consensus and a motA ortholog in RB49 were
unsuccessful [29] as were our attempts for RB49, RB43
and Aeh1. RB69 and 44RR also possess orthologs of the
MotA co-activator AsiA [34]. Surprisingly, Aeh1 and
KVP40, also encode AsiA proteins, which have been
shown to bind T4 MotA [35], even though no ligand
homologous or analogous to MotA has been identified for
these genomes. AsiA can act as transcriptional inhibitor in
the absence of MotA [35], or may interact with another
phage protein which has yet to be identified. Coordinates
of putative middle promoters can be found in the supplements (see additional file 4).
Late promoters
In T4, late promoters are recognized by a phage-encoded
σ factor, gp55. Contact between T4 gp55 and the DNA is
facilitated by the T4 polymerase sliding clamp, gp45. A
third T4-encoded gene product, gp33 forms a bridge
between gp55 and gp45 [36]. The T4 late promoter consensus sequence is a short but highly conserved motif,
TATAAATA, between nucleotide positions -13 and -6 relative to the transcriptional start site [3]. Putative late promoters were found readily for four of the five phage
genomes studied, using the strategy employed for early
and middle promoter searches (Figure 4B). However, the
T at position -13 was poorly conserved for most phages,
with either A or T commonly found at this position. A
similar observation was made for late promoters in an earlier description of RB49 late promoters [29], as well as in
KVP40 [7] and S-PM2 [8].

Since our search strategy failed to detect late promoter
sequences for phage Aeh1, an alternative strategy was
employed to identify them. Regions upstream of ORFs
orthologous to T4 late genes were analyzed with the ELPH
program [37] to identify sequence motifs common to
these DNA segments. The selected motifs were used as
seed to identify additional late promoter sequences using
HMMer. This strategy identified a conserved sequence,
CTAAATA, beginning at -12 from the putative initiation
site. Once identified, this putative promoter sequence was
used as a seed for string search followed by HMM refinement used for late promoters of the other phages.
Although the C at position -12 is a strong determinant for
detection of Aeh1 late promoters, C is rarely found at this
position in the putative late promoters of the other four
phage genomes (Figure 4B). It should be noted that the
phage Aeh1 gp55 protein, which presumably recognizes
the divergent late promoter sequences of Aeh1, is itself
substantially diverged from all the other phage gp55

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/30

sequences (data not shown). Coordinates of putative late
promoters can be found in the supplements (see additional file 5).
Terminators and operons
Putative rho-independent terminator sequences were
identified for all 5 genomes, using the TransTerm program
[38]. Although the locations of putative terminator
sequences vary between phages, several terminators
appear at conserved locations (see additional file 6). One
striking example is the bi-directional terminator predicted
downstream of uvsW.1that is conserved in T4 and the
other 5 genomes. In all cases, the gene downstream of
uvsW.1 is transcribed from the opposite strand and a bidirectional terminator is predicted between the converging
transcripts. Genes 35 and 36 are transcribed rightward and
a predicted terminator is located between them in all 6
genomes. Likewise, gene 23 has a terminator predicted
downstream in all 6 genomes. Terminators conserved in 5
out of 6 genomes were identified downstream of Gene 32
and upstream of alt.

Comparisons between the positions of predicted terminators and transcription initiation signals allowed the identification of putative operons of gene expression. An
example of operon structure from phage RB69 is shown in
Figure 3. In some instances, it appears that the upstream
promoters of novel genes drive expression of T4-like early
genes that lack their own early promoter. In general, T4like genes are predicted to be in operons with other T4like genes, while novel ORFs appear to reside in operons
with other novel ORFs.
tRNAs and codon bias
The bacteriophage T4 genome encodes eight tRNA genes
[3]. The other T4-like genome sequences were searched for
potential tRNA genes, using tRNAscan-SE [39]. The
number of potential tRNA genes varied considerably
among genomes (Table 1), ranging from zero in RB49 to
24 in Aeh1. Some common features were noted among
the tRNA genes encoded by the phage genomes (Table 4).
All genomes that encoded tRNAs had a predicted tRNA
with a CAU anticodon. Although predicted to be Met
tRNA by tRNAscan-SE, these tRNAs share signature
sequences found in tRNAs recognized by IleRS [40]. This
class of Ile tRNAs is post-transcriptionally modified to
lysidine at the anticodon, converting them to Ile-recognizing anticodons resembling AUA [41-44]. An alignment of
phage Ile and Met tRNAs is shown in Figure 5. tRNAs for
Leu, Ser and Arg are among the most commonly identified
putative tRNAs genes encoded in the T4-like genomes,
including the previously sequenced genomes of T4 and
KVP40. Other tRNAs are found more rarely, such as Ala,
Pro, Gly and Val. These recognize GC rich codons, which
are unusual in AT-rich T4-like genomes [18].

The presence of a tRNAscan-SE predicted species is indicated for each genome. The number of predicted tRNA pseudogenes is also indicated. *
indicates putative lysine-modified tRNAIle [41-44].

In bacteriophage T4, the presence of tRNA genes appears
to correlate with differences in codon bias for the phage
versus the E. coli host [3]. The genomes sequenced here
show much less correlation to differences from their laboratory hosts. A similar observation was made for the vibriophage KVP40 [7]. Thus, the functional role of the tRNA
genes for these phages remains unclear. Nevertheless, the
high degree of conservation of some tRNAs, such as the
putative modified tRNAIle mentioned above, suggests an
important functional role for at least some of these tRNAs.

Discussion
The genome sequences presented here display broad
diversity in primary sequence. Orthologous ORFs can be
detected for 45 to 85 percent of open reading frames
between any pair of these genomes. Orthologous protein
sequences are on average 65% similar between genomes.
This diversity is comparable to that seen across vertebrate
evolution. For example, humans and chickens share 60%
orthologous genes at a median amino acid similarity of
75%. Humans and teleost fishes share approximately
55% orthologous genes. The two most closely related
phage genomes analyzed here, T4 and RB69, share 80%
orthologs of 81% similarity, a distance comparable to that

between humans and mice. Despite the diversity of their
predicted protein sequences, these five T4-like phage
genomes share a highly conserved genome organization.
Most orthologs of T4 genes were identified in the same
gene order and orientation as the cistrons in T4. RB43
shows the largest number of exceptions to this observation. It appears that several genome rearrangements must
have occurred in one or both of these phages since they
diverged from their common ancestor.
The possibility of shared genetic regulatory elements
among the T4-like phages was investigated by motif
searches that identified putative promoter elements
resembling T4 early and late promoters in all genomes.
Late promoters were found exclusively 5' to conserved
orthologs of T4 late genes. Many early promoters were
found 5' to T4 early gene orthologs, but others were found
5' to novel ORFs. It thus appears that the early and late
transcriptional modes are conserved among the T4-like
phages. The novel ORFs appear to be coordinately
expressed with early genes in all phages. The middle gene
expression pathway appears to be less conserved among
the T4-like phages. The middle promoter consensus was
detected in RB69, and to a lesser degree in 44RR. The

MotA protein product, required for recognition of the
middle promoter Mot box, appears to be conserved only
in T4, RB69 and 44RR.
The T4 genome is predicted to encode over 120 ORFs of
unknown function. 11 ORFs were found to have
homologs in all five of the genomes in our study. Given
this level of conservation, these ORFs must encode products that are vital to the phage in some hosts or environments. We have identified putative functional domains
for 5 of these ORFs based on matches to known Pfam
domains. The candidate functions include nucleotide
metabolism, host cell lysis, and gene regulation. An aggregate of about 70% of T4 ORFs are conserved in at least one
other genome, suggesting that the protein products of
these ORFs provide selective advantages to these phages.
Conservation of these ORFs does not generally extend to
more divergent phages than those analyzed here.
Although several of these ORFs are conserved in KVP40,
no matches were found in any of the marine phage
genomes.
Each of the T4-like genomes we have examined, including
T4, harbors a number of ORFs that are unique to that
genome. In Aeh1, these novel ORFs comprise over half of
the Aeh1 genome and most show no significant similarity
to known sequences in GenBank. Functions identified for
some novel ORFs suggest physiologically important roles
in the phage life cycle, such as nucleotide metabolism,
transcription and lateral DNA mobility. However, most
novel ORFs have no known function or origin. It is thus
unclear where these sequences arose, how they were
acquired, and what function they might serve in the
phage-infected cell. In many instances, regions containing
novel ORFs were observed to be underrepresented in plasmid libraries constructed for shotgun sequencing and
were only identified during PCR-based gap closure [7]
and data not shown). It would appear then, that at least

some novel ORFs in our study are deleterious to the host
cell when expressed in high copy plasmids. Some of the
gene products of these ORFs may function in cell lysis or
in commandeering host machinery for phage growth.
The mechanisms of gain and loss of ORFs by T4-like
genomes in evolution may differ from that proposed for
the genomes of other phages, such as the lambdoid phage
[45]. The novel lambdoid ORFs include "morons" –
apparent short insertions of DNA consisting of an ORF
flanked by transcriptional promoter and terminator signals. Moron DNAs are distinct from other lambdoid genes
in %GC content, and thus appear to be recent acquisitions
of genes by nonhomologous recombination with host
DNA. In contrast, the majority of novel ORFs in T4-like
phages does not appear moronic; they have a %GC that is
indistinguishable from the rest of the phage genome
(average %GC in RB69: ORFs-36.9%, conserved-37.6%)
and thus do not appear to be recent acquisitions from the
host. Another class of novel lambdoid ORFs appears to be
chimeras of other phage genes [46]. In the few instances
where the T4-like novel ORFs have significant matches to
other phage or GenBank proteins, the similarities generally extend over the entire length of the coding sequence
rather than being restricted to the blocks of similarity
found in chimeras. A better understanding of the origins
of the novel ORFs in T4-like phages will provide clues into
the mechanisms underlying the evolution of protein coding sequences and the biology of host-phage interactions.
The mechanisms by which T4-like phages acquire ORFs
may differ from the lambdoid phages. T4-like phage do
not undergo lysogeny, thus they cannot acquire genes by
imprecise excision from the host genome. They do not
generally transduce host DNA as frequently as other Myoviridae, such as P22 [47], perhaps because of their propensity to hydrolyze host DNA. T4-like phages have a
recombination-driven replication pathway that is facilitated by redundant DNA sequences at the chromosome

Virology Journal 2006, 3:30

ends. During replication, the redundant end sequences
synapse with homologous regions of other replicating
DNA molecules for further replication into long concatamers [6]. A variation of this pathway has been postulated
as a mechanism for the lateral transfer of novel genes
between related phages [48]. However, the ultimate
source of these novel genes remains unknown but may
include bacterial hosts or bacteriophages encountered in
coinfection. The failure to detect significant similarities
between many of the novel ORFs described here and
known bacterial genomes indicates that either these ORFs
arose from bacterial hosts quite diverged from any known
bacterium, or that bacterial genomes are not a major
source for these ORFs. The latter appears to be more likely,
at least in the case of novel ORFs identified in closely
related phages, such as T4 and RB69. Unknown phages
would seem a more likely source for many of these ORFs.
Newly sequenced phage genomes often include numerous ORFs for which there is no known ortholog. Clearly,
more phage genomes must be mined to incorporate more
of their sequence diversity into the library of known
sequence databases.

Conclusion
Our survey of a diverse set of T4-like phage genomes
reveals similarities in general genome organization and
gene regulation. Although a core of conserved ORFs was
identified, the genome sequences exhibited a striking
diversity of ORFs novel to each genome. The origins of
this diversity have yet to be uncovered.

Methods
Bacteriophages and hosts
Bacteriophages, bacterial hosts and growth conditions
were as described [13]. Phage DNA was prepared from
plate lysates sequenced, and assembled as described in
[13].
Genome annotation
ORFs were detected primarily by use of the GeneMarkS
program [11,12]. The program was chosen based upon its
accuracy in ORF prediction of the T4 genomic sequence by
comparison to the GenBank accession (97% of ORFs recognized). When an orthologous gene was detected in a
related phage genome, the predicted translational start
sites were scrutinized for additional N-terminal protein
sequences with significant similarity to orthologs
upstream of the predicted translational start site. In these
cases, the translational start site was adjusted to maximize
the length of predicted amino acid similarity. Although
prediction models were not based upon similarity
between genomes, generally fewer than 5% of the predicted start sites required adjustment.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/30

GeneMarkS predictions were compared with those
obtained using Glimmer [49]. There was general agreement between the predictions obtained with the two programs. Glimmer predicted more ORFs per genome, but in
some cases the additional ORFs predicted were inconsistent with the direction of transcription of flanking genes,
which is uncommon in T4 [3] and appears unusual for the
genomes sequenced here. Thus, the Glimmer predictions
were used primarily to adjust GeneMarkS predictions as
mentioned above, or in regions where Glimmer predicted
an ORF and GeneMarkS predicted an unusually long (>
200 bp) intercistronic region.
Predicted ORFs were checked for similarity to T4 genes by
blastp [50] mutual similarity. Genes with mutual best hit
E-values < 10-4 to known T4 genes were designated by the
T4 gene name. Putative genes without T4 orthologs were
designated by their ORF numbers, with conserved gene
rIIA designated as ORF001. The strand of each ORF is designated "w" for clockwise (left-to-right) transcribed genes,
and "c" for counterclockwise (right-to-left) transcribed
genes. In T4, the origin of the genome has been assigned
to the rIIB – rIIA intercistronic region; the terminus of the
genome is defined as the start of translation of the rIIB
gene. The sequence origin of each genome sequenced here
is defined as the termination codon of the rIIA gene.
Genomes were also searched for tRNA genes using tRNAscan-SE [39]. All genomes except that of RB49 had at least
one putative tRNA gene.
