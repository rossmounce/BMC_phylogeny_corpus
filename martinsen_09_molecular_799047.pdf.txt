Abstract
Background: Non-coding satellite DNA (satDNA) usually has a high turn-over rate frequently
leading to species specific patterns. However, some satDNA families evolve more slowly and can
be found in several related species. Here, we analyzed the mode of evolution of the pDo500
satDNA family of Dolichopoda cave crickets. In addition, we discuss the potential of slowly evolving
satDNAs as phylogenetic markers.
Results: We sequenced 199 genomic or PCR amplified satDNA repeats of the pDo500 family from
12 Dolichopoda species. For the 38 populations under study, 39 pDo500 consensus sequences were
deduced. Phylogenetic analyses using Bayesian, Maximum Parsimony, and Maximum Likelihood
approaches yielded largely congruent tree topologies. The vast majority of pDo500 sequences
grouped according to species designation. Scatter plots and statistical tests revealed a significant
correlation between genetic distances for satDNA and mitochondrial DNA. Sliding window
analyses showed species specific patterns of variable and conserved regions. The evolutionary rate
of the pDo500 satDNA was estimated to be 1.63-1.78% per lineage per million years.
Conclusions: The pDo500 satDNA evolves gradually at a rate that is only slightly faster than
previously published rates of insect mitochondrial COI sequences. The pDo500 phylogeny was
basically congruent with the previously published mtDNA phylogenies. Accordingly, the slowly
evolving pDo500 satDNA family is indeed informative as a phylogenetic marker.

Background
Only a small fraction of a typical eukaryotic nuclear
genome constitutes rDNA or protein-coding genes,
whereas a large fraction of all higher eukaryotic genomes
consists of repetitive sequences and heterochromatic satellite DNA (satDNA) [1,2]. Recent sequencing of various
genomes have confirmed that the remarkable variability

in genome size among eukaryotes is to a large extent due
to different amounts of repetitive DNA, of which noncoding tandemly repeated DNA is a major part [3-7].
Typically, satDNA consists of numerous very similar
repeated sequences, tandemly arranged in a head to tail
orientation in large clusters up to 100 million bp in length

[1]. These clusters are usually located in the heterochromatic parts of the chromosomes, mainly in the regions
close to the centromeres and telomeres. Repeat size can
vary largely within and between species; from only a few
base pairs up to several thousand base pairs [8-11]. The
biological significance of satDNA is still under discussion.
No general function has been conclusively assigned to this
genome component, although a number of possible functions have been put forward (summarized in [12]) out of
which many challenge earlier ideas of satDNA being
"junk" [13] or selfish "parasites" in the genome [14]. Most
of the proposed functions of satDNA are related to heterochromatin and/or centromere formation and function.
However, the enormous diversity of satDNA in nucleotide
sequence, repeat length, complexity, and genomic abundance may indicate that satDNA indeed may have several
different functions.

isolation and strictly allopatric speciation processes can be
assumed [34]. This might allow insights into the shortterm processes of genetic differentiation of Dolichopoda
populations and species, and therefore makes the genus a
suitable model for studying processes of molecular evolution of satDNA. Three specific satDNA families have previously been characterized for three geographically
isolated populations of D. schiavazzii [35,36]. Two of
them, the pDoP102 and pDsPv400 satDNA families, are
species-specific whereas the pDo500 satDNA family occurs
in the genomes of all Dolichopoda species studied so far.
The pDo500 satDNA monomers have been found to
include repeat motifs that resemble the structure of hammerhead ribozymes. PDo500 sequences are also transcribed to some extent and may perform self-cleavage. It
has therefore been speculated that this satDNA may be
under selective pressure [37].

The evolutionary turnover of satDNA is usually very fast;
i.e. in closely related species non-orthologous satDNAs
are often found at homologous chromosomal locations
[15]. However, other satDNA families evolve more slowly
and are represented in several closely related species [1618]. Some satDNAs even seem to be rather ancient and
can be widely distributed among higher taxa [19,20].
Consequently, some satDNAs may be valuable taxonomic
identification tools while others might be informative in
phylogeny.

The mitochondrial DNA phylogeny of Dolichopoda has
been addressed in two recent studies [38,39]. Data on
other markers, such as allozyme variability [40,41], single
copy DNA-DNA hybridization [41], and RFLPs of mitochondrial DNA [42] are also available for many Dolichopoda species. These studies offer a solid background for
interpreting the mode of evolution of satDNA in this
genus. Here, we studied the pDo500 satDNA from twelve
species of Dolichopoda in detail. We were also interested to
assess whether or not a phylogenetic signal can be discerned from this satDNA family.

Most commonly, mitochondrial genes such as e.g., the
ribosomal 12S and 16S, or the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and II (COII) genes [21,22], and/or nuclear
ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences, such as the 18S and
28S genes, and the internally transcribed spacer (ITS)
regions are applied as molecular markers. Nuclear protein-coding genes such as e.g., the elongation factor-1α
(EF-1α), carbamyl-P synthetase/aspartate transcarbamylase/dihydroorotase (CAD), and wingless genes [23] have
also been applied. Some molecular features such as e.g.,
an A/T bias at the third codon position of mitochondrial
protein coding genes [24,25], and higher values of
among-site rate variation [26] may limit the phylogenetic
utility of standard markers under certain circumstances.
Some studies have explored the potential of satDNAs as
phylogenetic markers [18,27-33], but there is still no general agreement about the utility of satDNA in this context.
Here, we explored the mode of evolution of the specific
pDo500 satDNA family in the cave cricket genus Dolichopoda Bolivar 1880 (Dolichopodinae, Rhaphidophoridae).
Approximately 30 Dolichopoda species are patchily distributed throughout the North Mediterranean regions. They
have colonized caves and hypogean habitats between the
Pyrenees and the Caucasus. As most Dolichopoda species
depend on natural caves, a high degree of geographical

Results
Sequence composition and alignment
The nucleotide sequences of the pDo500 satDNA family in
12 Dolichopoda species were determined. We obtained 199
satDNA sequences with 3-9 sequences per population
(Table 1). The length of the pDo500 sequences ranged
from 463 bp to 505 bp. The total alignment consisted of
497 positions/characters (primer sequences excluded).
There were 385 (77%) variable positions, 269 (54%) of
which were parsimony informative. The average nucleotide composition was T = 35.3%, C = 24.6%, A = 21.7%
and G = 18.4%. The transition/transversion rate ratios
were k1 = 1.995 (purines) and k2 = 1.578 (pyrimidines).
The overall transition/transversion bias was R = 0.87. The
alignment of deduced population-specific consensus
sequences consisted of 39 sequences and 483 positions/
characters. Only for the PIL population of D. geniculata
two specific consensus sequences were deduced due to too
many ambiguous sites. There were 117 (24%) variable
positions of which 52 (11%) were parsimony informative
for the consensus sequence alignment. The average nucleotide composition of the deduced consensus sequences
was almost identical to that of the total data set, i.e. T =
35.2%, C = 24.7%, A = 21.7% and G = 18.4%.

The number of pDo500 sat DNA sequences per population and the mean genetic distance within and between populations (uncorrected pdistances) are listed.

Sliding window analyses
In order to identify regions within the pDo500 satDNA
family with high levels of intra- and interspecific sequence
conservation, sliding window analyses were performed.
As shown in Figure 1A, nucleotide diversity (π) ranged
between 0.009 and 0.093 for the consensus alignment.
Under the applied settings, there were three regions with
relatively low local minima of π (0.017, 0.009, and 0.014)
at window midpoint positions 180, 329, and 424, respectively. Conversely, there were four peak areas with relatively high π values (0.075, 0.076, 0.080 and 0.093) with
local maxima at window midpoint positions 202, 292,
357 and 239, respectively. When analyzing the complete
alignment that also takes into account the intrapopulational variation, there were three regions with relatively
low local minima of π (0.011, 0.00, and 0.010) at window
midpoint positions 83, 121, and 452, respectively (Figure
1B). The peaks indicating regions with high local maxima
were detected at positions 62 (π = 0.107), 118 (π = 0.180),
248 (π = 0.106), and 299 (π = 0.096). At first glance the
extremely low π value around window midpoint position
121 in the total alignment may be surprising because this
low local variation is not reflected in the consensus alignment to that extreme. However, the "discrepancy" can be
assigned to different arrangements of indels in the two
alignments and some ambiguous sites in the consensus
sequences. It is also worthwhile mentioning that the area
in the sliding window analysis that corresponds to the
region that can form a hammerhead-like structure [37]
does not show higher levels of conservation than the rest
of the sequence.

The sliding window analyses for selected species that are
represented by a reasonable number of populations and
individual pDo500 sequences are shown in Figure 2. Five
areas with high interspecific variability were identified: i)
For positions 66-124 D. laetitiae was significantly different
from the other species (p < 0.05); ii) For positions 200250 D. linderi and D. geniculata differed significantly from

the other species (p < 0.05) but not from each other; iii)
For positions 300-320 D. linderi and D. laetitiae were significantly different from the other species and from each
other (p < 0.05); iv) For positions 350-380 D. linderi and
D. laetitiae are significantly different from the other species and from each other (p < 0.05); and v) For positions
447-490 D. geniculata and D. linderi are significantly different from the other species (p < 0.05) but not from each
other.
Genetic distance analyses
The mean K2P and uncorrected p distances of the pDo500
satDNA sequences within and between populations as
well as between species are given in Additional files 1 and
2, respectively.

The scatter plot (Figure 3) relates the mean interpopulational uncorrected p-distances of pDo500 satDNA
sequences to the average mtDNA distances calculated
from partial 16S and COI sequences [38,39]. There was a
highly significant correlation between genetic distances
based on the two molecular markers (Mantel test: r =
0.616, p = 0.0001). The Spearman Ranks Correlation tests
revealed that also the interpopulational genetic distances
within and between species of the pDo500 satDNA and
the mtDNA were correlated, Rs = 0.234 (p < 0.0001) and
Rs = 0.231 (p = 0.03), respectively. The biological relevance of the correlations from the Spearmans Ranks test
might be debated due to the low Rs values. There was also
a significant correlation between the genetic distances
based on satDNA and the geographic distances between
the populations (Mantel test: r = 0.274, p = 0.0001).
Despite the observed significant overall association, it is
noteworthy that for the pDo500 satDNA, a number of
intraspecific genetic distance values are higher than some
of the interspecific values, e.g. between some D. linderi
populations and some D. schiavazzii populations. On the
other hand, some interspecific genetic distance values are
quite low, e.g. D. laetitiae (DIA) vs D. geniculata. For com-

the intraspecific genetic distance values are lower than the
interspecific values.

Bayesian phylogeny of the 39 derived consensus sequences the pDo500 satellite DNA family of Dolichopoda
cave crickets. The Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood analyses yielded largely congruent trees. Posterior probabilities (PP)
and bootstrap support > 50 from the MP and ML analyses are given for each node in the following order PP/MP/ML. Abbreviations for populations are as in Table 1.

netic analyses (MP, MrBayes and ML) resulted in very similar tree topologies with only a few minor incongruencies.
The MP analysis yielded 425 trees of equal length (252
steps) whereas ML analysis resulted in two trees; in both
cases, the 50% majority-rule consensus trees were congruent with the phylogenetic hypothesis obtained with the
Bayesian analysis.
As shown in Figure 4, the pDo500 sequences clustered in
three main groups in the Bayesian tree: 1) D. bolivari and
the majority of the sequences from D. linderi, 2) D. ligustica and D. schiavazzii, and 3) D. geniculata, D. laetitiae, D.
aegilion, D. baccettii, D. cyrnensis, D. capreensis and D. palpata, in addition to two sequences from D. linderi (VMY
and MTB). In contrast to high posterior probability values
in the Bayesian analysis the bootstrap support values from
the MP analysis are quite low for many nodes.
The phylogeny obtained with the complete pDo500 alignment (Additional file 3) is congruent with the phylogeny
of the consensus alignment. However, there are also some
sequences that do not cluster conspecifically, which
reflected the intraspecific variation among pDo500
repeats. To some extent, sequences from the same population cluster together, but there is little intraspecific structure in the phylogeny of the complete alignment. This
means that hardly any population-specific signatures
could be attributed to the pDo500 sequences.
Evolutionary rate estimates
The pDo500 sequences evolve on average 1.48 times faster
than the COI sequences from Dolichopoda. Multiplied by
the previously reported substitution rate for insect COI
genes of 1.1-1.2% per lineage per million years, per silent
sites [43], this gives an evolutionary rate of 1.63-1.78%
per lineage per million years for the pDo500 sequences.

The congruency of the satDNA dataset and the previously
published mtDNA dataset were evaluated by a partition
homogeneity test/ILD and Partitioned Bremer Support
(PBS) values. Three different tests were performed for the
ILD: i) pDo500 + COI, ii) pDo500 + 16S, and iii) pDo500 +
COI + 16S. The null hypothesis of homogeneity of the
phylogenetic signal among the data sets were rejected for
all three tests (p = 0.001). This may indicate that the two
data sets reflect different phylogenetic signals that should
yield incongruent phylogenetic trees. PBS values were
determined for one of the MPTs, the strict consensus and
the 50% majority rule consensus tree. The strict consensus
tree did not yield informative PBS values probably due to
lack of structure in the tree, i.e. too many polytomies. The
PBS values for the MPT and the 50% MJR consensus tree
(Additional files 4 and 5) were to some extent indicating
conflict between the two datasets and thus in line with the
results of the ILD tests. However, the satellite DNA and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/301

the mtDNA sequences do not contribute equally to the
tree. The mtDNA sequences are approximately three times
as long as the pDo500 satDNA sequences and accordingly
contribute more parsimony informative sites (296) than
the pDo500 satDNA consensus sequences (52). Nodes
with PBS values indicating strongest conflict were usually
those with both low bootstrap support and posterior
probabilities in the phylogenetic analyses. Not surprinsingly, for nodes with strong statistical support in the phylogenetic analyses, the PBS values indicated only little
conflict. However, conflicting PBS values are certainly to
some extent due to the high number of equally parsimonious trees obtained in the analysis of the combined data
set as described by Lambkin et al. [44].

Discussion
In the current paper, we study the mode of evolution of
the tandemly arranged satellite DNA family pDo500 in
Dolichopoda cave crickets. Scatter plots and the related statistical analyses showed a significant correlation between
the K2P distances calculated for mtDNA and the pDo500
satDNA. The pDo500 sequences evolve on average 1.48
times faster than the COI sequences from Dolichopoda.
This is lower than previously observed for Hawaiian
Tetragnatha spiders, for which a four times increased
nucleotide substitution rate has been reported for satDNA
compared to mtDNA [30]. The among-site rate variation
of the pDo500 was higher than estimated for mtDNA from
the same species, which may indicate that some regions of
the pDo500 sequences are under selection. Accordingly,
previous observations on preliminary data from populations of the D. laetitae-geniculata complex already indicated that this family of sequences is not informative at
the intraspecific level [45]. As has been reported for most
satDNA families the pDo500 family is slightly AT-rich
(~57%), which is also common for mtDNA. Nevertheless,
homoplasy is expected to be limited for the pDo500
satDNA family because no saturation was detected.
Whether or not the pDo500 family is a typically slowly
evolving satDNA with respect to among-site rate variation
and saturation is difficult to assess. Among-site rate variation has hardly ever been reported for satDNA families,
and saturation tests have only rarely been performed, e.g.
in Pons et al. (2002) [29] who report slight saturation for
the PIM357 satDNA family in Pimelia. Nevertheless, the
high among-site rate variation did not obscure the phylogenetic signal in the pDo500 satDNA sequences. This conclusion may to some extent contradict the results of the
sliding window analyses. For at least some species such as
e.g. D. ligustica, D. schiavazzii, and D. linderi the sliding
window profiles differed significantly.
pDo500 satDNA based phylogeny in Dolichopoda
The phylogeny obtained with the pDo500 satDNA (Figure

viously published on the basis of mtDNA markers
[38,39]. The main differences between these phylogenies
can be summarized as follows: i) Two well supported clusters in the mtDNA tree appear in different positions in the
satDNA phylogeny. These clusters are D. geniculata + D.
laetitiae and D. schiavazzii, which swap positions. ii) With
satDNA as marker the two Corsican species D. cyrnensis
and D. bormansi do not cluster together. iii) In two cases
(D. linderi and D. geniculata) satDNA consensus sequences
representing different populations do not cluster conspecifically.
In earlier studies on the phylogeny of Dolichopoda using
the mitochondrial 16S and cytochrome oxidase I genes,
the northern Italian D. ligustica grouped with the Centraland Southern-Italian D.laetitiae-geniculata complex. With
respect to biogeography this grouping was difficult to
explain [39]. However, in the satDNA phylogeny, D. ligustica grouped with the more northern species D. schiavazzii.
Similarly, the two southernmost species D. palpata and D.
capreensis grouped with the Northern Italian D. schiavazzii
in the mtDNA phylogeny, which apparently did not conform to the biogeographical pattern. In contrast, the
satDNA phylogeny indicates that D. palpata and D.
capreensis are closely related to D. laetitae-geniculata complex that is also geographically closest. Thus, we believe
that at least in these instances, the tree topology obtained
with the pDo500 data is a better reflection of the Dolichopoda phylogeny than those obtained with mtDNA markers.
However, D. baccettii and its sister taxon D. aegilion are
geographically more close to D. schiavazzii, but in the
satDNA phylogeny, as opposed to the mtDNA phylogeny,
D. baccettii and D. aegilion are found closely related to D.
laetitiae-geniculata. This is in line with the results of a preliminary study [46]. Interestingly, the D. laetitiae-geniculata complex is also found in the mid-Italian region as is
D. baccettii, therefore, the relationships found in the
satDNA tree may be plausible. However, morphological
features are more in favour of the phylogeny as resolved
by mtDNA sequences, since D. schiavazzii, D. bormansi and
D. cyrnensis share spinulation on the femurs and are
grouped in the same subgenus Chopardina. Furthermore,
D. bormansi, and D. cyrnensis have been recorded from the
same caves and even hybridization of the two species has
been hypothesized [47]. The incongruence between the
satDNA and mtDNA may have been expected at least
according to the results of the sliding window analyses.
These results indicated that the intra- and interspecific variation of different regions of the pDo500 repeats differ significantly. Accordingly, among-site rate variation in the
dataset was high. However, the incongruencies may also
be due to stochastic processes in the usually small Dolichopoda populations such as random sorting of ancestral
lineages during the short internodes, homoplasy in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/301

mtDNA data, or both. The processes of molecular drive
(see [48] for a review on molecular drive) affecting the
pDo500 satDNA may also lead to an accumulation of variants that do not perfectly reflect the phylogenetic relationships.
As mentioned above, the level of the among-site rate variation of the pDo500 is higher (α = 0.59) than estimated
for mtDNA (α = 0.88). This could be due to selection pressure on the region where the previously reported hammerhead structure is found [37]. However, according to the
sliding window analyses performed here, this region is
overall not more conserved than the rest of the pDo500
repeat. Nevertheless, since it is the secondary structure
that is most crucial to the hammerhead and not the
sequence itself, we can not rule out that the potential
hammerhead structure has a profound influence on the
evolution of the pDo500 satDNA family.
The congruence of the phylogenies obtained with the
pDo500 satDNA and mtDNA markers is to some extent
contradicted by the results of the ILD test and the PBS values. The partition homogeneity test indicates disagreement between the phylogenetic signal in the data sets
based on mtDNA and satDNA. However, several authors
have questioned the validity of this test as a criterion for
congruence and combinability [49,50]. It has been demonstrated that the ILD test can wrongly reject the null
hypothesis of congruence if the two data sets compared
have different among-site rate variation [51]. Whether this
applies to our data sets is uncertain as the satDNA and the
mtDNA data sets differ only slightly in among-site variation. However, the ILD test is also sensitive for homoplasy, meaning random noise that is unequally
distributed between the partitions [50]. There is homoplasy in both data sets due to little intraspecific structure;
for example, within D. schiavazzii the populations can
change position in the tree topology without altering the
tree length. In our dataset a number of species were represented by several populations all with very similar if not
identical pDo500 satDNA sequences. It is thus not surprising that parsimony analyses yielded many equally parsimonious trees. However, this may lead for several nodes
to PBS values indicating conflicts between the combined
satDNA and mtDNA datasets. However, it should be
noted that nodes with PBS values indicating strongest
conflict were usually those with both low bootstrap support and low posterior probabilities in the phylogenetic
analyses.
Our study has added to the evidence that there is a clear
potential for using slowly evolving satDNA families as
phylogenetic markers. This is in line with a number of previous studies e.g. [17,18,30,52] that also used consensus
sequences of satDNA and obtained phylogenies that were

Page 8 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:301

largely congruent with those based on other markers. In
addition, several studies have successfully used satDNA as
taxonomic and phylogenetic markers to solve issues that
other markers such as e.g., mtDNA markers could not
resolve [53,54].
There is an extensive literature on the characteristics of
molecular phylogenetic markers e.g. [22,26,55-65], and at
least at first glance satDNA seems to violate all requirements. In brief, a phylogenetic molecular marker must
show an appropriate level of sequence conservation for
the taxa of interest, while at the same time providing a sufficient number of variable and informative sites. Ideally,
all sites should vary with equal probability because high
among-site rate variation might hamper obtaining the
true phylogeny. Furthermore, equal base composition
will keep homoplasy low. Single-copy sequences are preferred in order to avoid paralogous comparisons. Finally,
methodological aspects, such as ease to amplify by PCR or
the availability of universal primers, are relevant as well.
No marker will satisfy all of the above criteria and systematists therefore have developed a toolbox of most commonly used markers.
In comparison to protein-coding and ribosomal genes,
the evolutionary turnover of non-coding satDNA is usually very high, leading to marked sequence divergence
between species. Thus, there is often little or no phylogenetic signal when comparing satDNA from closely related
species e.g. [66]. Accordingly, two species-specific satDNAs have earlier been described also for Dolichopoda schiavazzii [16,36]. For the pDo500 satDNA family, we have
also shown high among-site rate variation, and for tandemly repeated satDNA paralogous comparisons are certainly an issue. In addition, there are no universal
satDNAs and slowly evolving satDNA families to be used
as phylogenetic markers need to be identified case by case.
Nevertheless, several satDNAs such as the pDo500 satDNA
family have been described as gradually evolving, and are
conserved over considerable evolutionary time. Such
satDNA
may
be
phylogenetically
informative
[16,17,29,67,68]. For the pDo500 satDNA family, once
sequences were available, the alignment of repeats was
straightforward because there were only few indels.

Conclusion
Most satellite DNAs described so far have high evolutionary turn-over rates leading to rapid changes between species (interspecific heterogeneity) in contrast to
homogenization and fixation within species (intraspecific
homogeneity). However, as discussed here, some satDNA
families such as the pDo500 satDNA family of Dolichopoda
cave crickets may evolve rather slowly with an evolutionary rate only slightly faster than mtDNA. In Dolichopoda,
both the fast evolving and the more slowly evolving

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/301

satDNA have been found. In D. schiavazzii, two speciesspecific satDNA families have been identified, the
pDoP102 (102 bp) and pDsPv400 (400 bp) in addition to
the genus-specific family of pDo500 studied here [35,36].
These three satellite DNA families differ significantly in
their molecular characteristics. A comparison showed a
trend of sequence variability and copy number being positively correlated, and a trend of sequence variability and
length of repeat being negative correlation [36], but data
sets from further species are needed in order assess if these
trends reflect general patterns. Unfortunately, very few
other examples are found in the literature with both fastevolving and slowly-evolving satDNAs found within the
same species e.g. [69,70].
For some satDNA families a high degree of conservation
was observed for species that diverged millions of years
ago [52,71-73]. Such slowly evolving satDNA can even be
a useful tool for phylogenetic analyses at higher taxonomic levels. Our study illustrates that satellite DNA can
be successfully used as a molecular marker in phylogenetic analyses. In a phylogeographic context we believe
that the pDo500 in some cases yields even better hypotheses than mtDNA. Compared with other commonly used
markers - mtDNA and nuclear protein-coding and rDNA
genes - particular gradually evolving satellite DNA families may fulfil the criteria of a good phylogenetic marker
satisfactorily.

Methods
Material
We included samples from 38 populations representing
12 Dolichopoda cave cricket species from Italy and Spain
(Table 1). The species' distributions are given in Additional file 6. Previously reported sequences of the pDo500
satDNA family from three populations of D. schiavazzii
(VET, CPS, and BDO) [36] were also included in the analyses.
DNA extraction, PCR, cloning and sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted from femurs and heads of
Dolichopoda using the QIAamp DNA purification kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions, or by
standard procedures as described in Sambrook et al. [74].

Sequences of the pDo500 satDNA family used in this study
were obtained by two different approaches: i) Genomic
DNA was digested with the restriction enzyme PstI and
subsequently electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide gels.
The ladder-like strongly stained bands were cloned into
standard plasmid vectors such as e.g., pUC19 [74]. Plasmid preparation was done according to the protocol of
the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). This approach
can only discover pDo500 copies containing the PstI cleavage site. ii) Copies of the pDo500 satDNA family were

amplified from genomic template DNA using the primers
5'-GTTTTACACGTTCACTGCAG-3' and 5'-GACACATTGATGAGACTGCAG-3' [36]. The obtained PCR products
were cloned using the Zero Blunt® TOPO® Cloning Kit
(Invitrogen). Positive clones were selected through PCR
amplification using the M13 forward and M13 reverse
primers. Sequencing was performed on an ABI 3100 automatic sequencer using BigDye chemistry (Applied Biosystems). This approach may be biased by preferential
annealing of the primers to certain pDo500 variants.

sus sequences. The appropriate substitution models were
determined using MrModeltest [79]. For both alignments,
the general time reversible substitution model with
gamma distribution for the among-site rate variation
(GTR+Γ) obtained highest score according to the Akaike
information criterion. The shape parameter of the gamma
distribution (α) is inversely related to the rate of variation,
and low values (α < 0.5) suggest extreme rate heterogeneity [80]. Accordingly, for the pDo500 sequences α = 0.59
suggests a relatively high rate heterogeneity.

All sequences have been deposited in GenBank, accession
numbers: GU322143-GU322341

The Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was conducted using
MrBayes [81]. Each analysis was run with 6 million generations, 4 chains (one cold, three heated) and a sampling
frequency of 100. A 50% majority rule consensus tree was
made from each analysis with the first 12,000 trees
ignored as burn-in. The ML using PAUP [82] was conducted through the Bioportal at the University of Oslo,
Norway http://www.bioportal.uio.no/. MP was done
using the program TNT (Tree analysis using New Technology) [83] made available online with the sponsorship of
the Willi Hennig Society http://www.cladistics.org/
tnt.html. The TNT searches were conducted with gaps
being treated as fifth character state. Bootstrap support
values [84] were estimated for both the ML analysis and
the MP analyses, with 500 and 1000 repetitions respectively.

Sequence Analyses
The sequences were aligned using the software BioEdit
[75]. Due to the high level of sequence similarity aligning
all sequences was straightforward. The primer sequences
of the PCR derived pDo500 repeats were excluded from
the subsequent analyses.

Following the concept of concerted evolution [76], population-specific consensus sequences were deduced manually by evaluating each position in the alignment
according to the six classes of transitional stages in tandem repetitive DNA described by Strachan et al. [77]. The
different stages represent various steps in the homogenization and fixation process amongst repeats of tandemly
repeated DNA families between pairs of species and populations. In essence this means that we used a 50% majority rule to deduce the consensus sequence. In some cases
we either used the standard IUPAC symbols for ambiguous sites or deduced more than one consensus sequence
for the respective populations.
Nucleotide composition, number of variable and parsimony informative sites, the transition/transversion bias,
and genetic distance values were calculated using Mega
version 4.0.1 [78]. All positions containing alignment
gaps and missing data were excluded in pair-wise
sequence comparisons.
Phylogenetic reconstruction and statistics
In order to assess whether nucleotide substitutions reach
saturation, both transitions and transversions, and uncorrected genetic distances (p-distance), were plotted in
Microsoft Excel against distances based on the generaltimes reversible model (GTR). The GTR distances were calculated in PAUP through the Bioportal at the University of
Oslo, Norway http://www.bioportal.uio.no/.

Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using Bayesian,
Maximum Likelihood (ML), and Maximum Parsimony
(MP) approaches. The phylogenetic analyses were performed on both the complete alignment and the consen-

The evolutionary rate of the pDo500 satDNA family was
estimated in relation to a previously reported substitution
rate (1.1-1.2% per lineage, per million years, per silent
sites) for insect mitochondrial COI sequences [43]. Interspecific K2P distances [85] for the pDo500 satDNA data set
were related to interspecific genetic distances for the COI
data set from the same species in order to estimate the relative evolutionary rate. The species specific average multiplied by the 1.1-1.2% rate estimate yielded the
evolutionary rate of pDo500. These estimates include all
pDo500 sequences obtained in this study.
Sliding window analyses were performed in DnaSP [86]
in order to detect regions of high sequence conservation.
In DnaSP, gaps are not treated as a fifth character state
when analyzing the data, but in the sliding window analysis it is possible to consider sites with gaps in the length
of the windows. We conducted the analyses with both
options. The window sizes were set as 50, 30 and 20,
respectively, with three different step sizes, 1, 5 and 10, for
all three window sizes. The analysis was performed on
both the consensus alignment and the complete alignment. Since the sliding window analysis in DnaSP can not
handle more than 181 sequences, our complete alignment needed to be slightly reduced. Sequences to be
excluded from the analysis were randomly chosen from
those populations with the highest number of sequences.

We also analyzed the sequences of D. schiavazzii, D. geniculata, D. linderi, and D. ligustica separately. Since DnaSP
does not handle standard IUPAC symbols for ambiguous
sites, such positions in the consensus alignment were
replaced by N's.
From the sliding window analyses of D. schiavazzii, D.
geniculata, D. linderi, D. laetitiae and D. ligustica, regions in
the pDo500 satDNA sequences with high variability
between the species were identified. Uncorrected p-distances within each species were calculated for these
regions [78], and subjected to an Analysis of Variance
(Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA) with subsequent Post-hoc tests Tukey honest significant difference test for unequal sample size [87]. The tests were performed in Statistica [88].
The congruence of the satDNA and the mitochondrial
DNA data sets was addressed with a partition homogeneity test/incongruence-length difference test (ILD) and by
Partitioned Bremer Support (PBS). The ILD test was performed in PAUP [82] and TNT; the Partitioned Bremer
Support was obtained using TreeRot [89] in combination
with PAUP (following the instructions of the TreeRot
manual). In PAUP, the number of ILD replicates was set
to 1,000, with 10 random addition sequence replicates,
holding one tree per replicate. A time limit for each replicate was set to 200 seconds. In TNT, the analysis was done
with a script provided by Pablo Goloboff with some modifications [90]. The number of replicates was set to
10,000, with 10 random addition sequences holding 10
trees per replicate, and branch swapping with TBR (tree
bisection-reconnection). For calculating the PBS parsimony analysis was conducted in PAUP on the satDNA
consensus sequences combined with the mtDNA
sequences. The analysis yielded 14,232 most parsimonious trees (MPTs). For the analysis in TreeRot, we used
both of the consensus trees and one of the equally parsimonious MPTs (the first one to appear in the tree file from
PAUP).
Scatter plots showing interpopulational and interspecific
distances from pDo500 sequences versus mitochondrial
DNA sequences were made in Microsoft Excel. Two different plots at each taxonomic level were made: one using all
the pDo500 sequences, and one using only the consensus
sequences. The results were similar and we only present
the plot with the consensus sequences.

tances. The program ArcView Gis 3.3 was used to obtain
geographic distances.
Spearman Rank Correlation tests were performed in order
to assess the correlation between genetic distances based
on satDNA and mtDNA in within- and between species
comparison, respectively. The tests were performed using
the Free Statistics and Forecasting Software at http://
www.wessa.net[92].
