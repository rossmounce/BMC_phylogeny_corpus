Abstract
Background: Huanglongbing (HLB, previously known as citrus greening), is associated with
Candidatus Liberibacter species and is a serious threat to citrus production world-wide. The
pathogen is a Gram negative, unculturable, phloem-limited bacterium with limited known genomic
information. Expanding the genetic knowledge of this organism may provide better understanding
of the pathogen and possibly develop effective strategies for control and management of HLB.
Results: Here, we report cloning and characterization of an additional 14.7 Kb of new genomic
sequences from three different genomic regions of the Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (Las).
Sequence variation analyses among the available Ca. Liberibacter species sequences as well as the
newly cloned 1.5 Kb of rpoB gene from different Ca. Liberibacter strains have identified INDELs and
SNPs. Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced protein sequences from the cloned regions
characterizes the HLB-associated Candidatus Liberibacter as a new clade in the sub-division of the
α-proteobacteria.
Conclusion: Comparative analyses of the cloned gene regions of Candidatus Liberibacter with
members of the order Rhizobiales suggest overall gene structure and order conservation, albeit
with minor variations including gene decay due to the identified pseudogenes. The newly cloned
gene regions contribute to our understanding of the molecular aspects of genomic evolution of Ca.

Background
Huanglongbing (HLB) previously known as citrus greening, associated with Candidatus Liberibacter species is the
most serious threat to citrus production due to reduced
fruit quality and tree death [1]. Currently, three major
forms of the disease are recognized as being associated
with three different Candidatus Liberibacter species, Ca.
Liberibacter asiaticus (Las), Ca. Liberibacter africanus
(Laf), and Ca. Liberibacter americanus (Lam) [2]. The bacteria associated with HLB are Gram negative, unculturable, phloem-restricted α-proteobacteria and are
transmitted by psyllids [1,3]. Until recently, the available
genetic information included the 16S rRNA, the rplKAJLrpoBC operon and the OMP regions [4-9]. Collectively,
this amounts to ~15.6 Kb of the non-redundant DNA
sequences from these three regions of the genome. In our
recent report, we cloned and characterized 8.56 Kb of
genomic sequences from a Las strain using a genomic
walking method [10].
Studies of the comparative gene organization and gene
order among related bacteria, can lead to improved
understanding of the functional significance of gene
arrangements among them [11,12]. Such information can
either be derived from phylogenetic profiles [13] or from
comparative genome analyses [14]. The information may
also provide insight into these organisms' evolutionary
history and metabolic capabilities [15].

In this study, we report cloning and characterization of an
additional 14.7 Kb of new genomic DNA from Las following the recently described modified genomic walking
method [10]. We further discuss the comparative phylogenomics of Ca. Liberibacter species gene structure and
evolution to understand the gene organization of this
obligate plant pathogen.

Results
Cloning of new genomic regions, gene characteristics and
homology studies
Primers were designed based on the previous sequence
information and incorporated into the walking strategy as
detailed earlier [10]. Using the sequence data from the
genomic walk and primers listed in Table 1, genomic
DNA fragments were amplified as PCR products directly
from the DNA extracts of infected tissue. For details, see
Additional file 1.
Region-1
This region was extended by 3,218 bp at the 5' end and by
2,673 bp on the 3' end to the previously reported
sequence [10]. With this newly cloned sequence and the
previously known sequence, there is 17.1 Kb of DNA
sequence known from this region. BLAST based similarity
searches of the 5' end identified a partial gene coding for
fimbrial assembly protein PilP, and a full-length gene coding for phosphoserine aminotransferase (serA). However,

there is a 950 bp DNA sequence between this gene and the
previously identified pseudogene D-3-phosphoglycerate
dehydrogenase, where no gene models were identifiable.
Partial gene sequence (2.3 Kb) of the rpoC gene was identified at the 3' end. In total there are now 12 genes and one
pseudogene in this region.
Region-2
In this study, the 5' end of region-2 was extended by 1,776
bp and the 3' end by 1,908 bp. This brings the DNA
sequence known in this region of the genome to 6.6 Kb.
Importantly, we have now obtained the full-length
sequences of the 16S region, as BLAST searches have identified a pseudogene caused by a frame shift mutation next
to the 16S rRNA gene suggesting that we have walked out
of the 16S rRNA gene region. At the 3' end, we cloned
1,908 bp of new DNA sequence of the 23S rRNA gene.
Region-3
This region was extended beyond previously reported
[10] to a further 4,150 bp at the 5' end and by 1,037 bp of
DNA sequence at the 3' end. With this new DNA
sequence, the sequence for the omp gene region known
from this organism is now 10.5 Kb long. BLAST similarity
searches have identified a partial gene coding for putative
transmembrane protein (rpsB) at the 5' end, and four fulllength genes coding for proteins and a pseudogene,
including elongation factor Ts (tsf), uridylate kinase
(pyrH), ribosome recycling factor (frr), frame shift
induced pseudogene for undecaprenyl pyrophosphate
synthetase (uppS), and phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase
(cdsA2). Similarly, at the 3' end, the remaining sequence
of the gene coding for the full-length lipid A biosynthesis
acyl- [acyl-carrier-protein]-UDP-N-acetylglucosamine Oacyltransferase was cloned, as well as the partial DNA
sequence coding for phosphatidate cytidyltransferase
gene (COG3494). In total, there are now 11 genes and a
pseudogene known in this region.
Inter-strain; inter-species sequence variations
At the time when this study was conducted, a total of 86
Ca. Liberibacter sequences were publicly available in the
GenBank databases. These sequences from Las, Laf and
Lam strains were compared to identify sequence variations within and among the three genomic regions to
define the cumulative diversity. Of these 86 submissions,
76 are Las sequences, seven are Laf sequences and three
are Lam sequences. The majority of the submissions (58
of the 86) were from the 16S-23S region with the rest of
the sequences were from gene cluster (19 sequences) and
omp (nine sequences) regions. The variations in the 16S
rRNA gene sequence among the three Ca. Liberibacter species ranged from 90–94%. There is a large INDEL of ~17
bp identified in the Lam strain compared to the Las and
Laf strains in this region. A sequence variation of 29% was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/1/72

noted for the omp gene sequences between Las and Laf
strains.
Intra-species sequence conservation for 16S-23S region
among the Las and Lam strains was higher (>95%) than
the two Laf strains (93%). Similarly, the six Las strains
showed little variation (<1%) for the omp gene.
The primer pair RpoB-las-laf-F and RpoB-las-laf-R amplified a 1,508 bp fragment from the DNA extracts from citrus leaf tissues infected with multiple strains of Las strain
from China, Japan, Sao Paulo (Brazil) and Florida (USA),
as well as the Laf strain (Mpumalanga) from South Africa
(Tables 1 &2). The DNA fragments associated with Las
strains from Florida and Brazil were identical for the
above region. In contrast, there were two SNPs at nucleotide positions 930 and 1,392 in these strains and the
strain from China. Both of these SNPs are transversion (T
to C) mutations. The Laf strain differed by 180 SNPs and
182 SNPs from the Florida and the Brazilian Las and Chinese strain, respectively.
Phylogenetic analysis
Topology of the 16S rRNA tree for nine Ca. Liberibacter
asiaticus strains, two Ca. Liberibacter africanus strains and
two Ca. Liberibacter africanus strains segregated according
to the existing species classification (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, for the Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus, the strains from
Florida, USA and Sao Paulo, Brazil were interspersed with
multiple strains from China suggesting the lack of geographic grouping within Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus. Among
the three species, only the Ca. Liberibacter africanus
strains showed longer inner branches owing to their subspecies status. With respect to the other bacteria used in
the analyses, the 16S rRNA Neighbor-joining tree and the
concatenated protein sequence (3401 aa) derived tree for
Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus showed similar tree topology
(Fig. 1A–B). Both the trees placed Ca. Liberibacter species
at the bottom of the order Rhizobiales with a high bootstrap value of 96–100. The tree topology suggests that Ca.
Liberibacter's segregated earlier from the Rhizobiales and
Rickettsiales in the α-proteobacterial division, suggesting
its independent evolution as a sub-division.
Gene organization and gene order conservation
Region-1
Comparison of the gene order in the Region-1 from nine
bacterial species including Ca. Liberibacter species suggests conservation among these bacteria from tsf (Ef-Tu)
to the rpoC gene for this region with minor variations (Fig.
2; R. etli figure not included).
Region-2
The gene order of Region-2 was 16S rRNA-tRNAIletRNAAla-23S rRNA and was relatively conserved among

these eight bacterial species with minor variations especially for the genes cloned from the 5' end (Fig. 3).
Region-3
An overall similarity in gene structure conservation was
observed for the omp region where the gene order of all the
11 genes (rpsB-tsf-Tu-pyrH-frr-uppS-cdsA2-yaeL-omp-lpxDfabZ-lpxA) was conserved in seven bacteria (S. meliloti, B.
quintana, B. melitensis, R. etli, A. tumefaciens, M. loti and
Ca. L. asiaticus (Fig. 4). In these bacteria, there was
another conserved gene of the COG03494 group (uncharacterized conserved protein), similar to phosphatidate
cytidylyltransferase, at the 3'-end of this 11 gene cluster. In
the other six bacteria, M. loti, S. meliloti, B. melitensis,
A.tumefaciens B. quintana and R. etli, this gene is followed
by lpxA gene. This region was least conserved in the bacterium R. bellii.

Discussion
In this study, we report cloning and characterization of
new genomic regions from Ca. Liberibacter species and
compare the overall sequence diversity in the sequences of
these bacteria in the GenBank.
Comparison of DNA sequences for the 16S, omp and rpoB
genes from GenBank and the sequences cloned in this
study shows that there is very little sequence variation
among the different Ca. Liberibacter species suggesting
strong host and/or environmental selection and a genetically stable lineage of the pathogen. The 16S sequences

were more conserved among the Las strains while; a
slightly higher degree of sequence variation was noted for
the Laf strains. Alignments for a ~1.5 Kb region of the rpoB
of Las strains and Laf strains revealed that strain from
China differed by two SNPs from the Japan, Florida and
Brazil strains, which were identical at this locus. These two
SNPs were possibly introduced later in the Chinese strain
after their separation from the other Las strains.
Our phylogenetic analyses based on the 16S rRNA and the
concatenated protein sequences from eight genes, places
Ca. Liberibacter species as a new clade in the sub-division
of the α-proteobacteria [2]. This agrees with the previously reported 16S rRNA and omp gene based phylogenetic analyses [16,17]. The inclusion of the new genes
showed similar results to those based upon the 16S rRNA
and the omp gene, suggesting future inclusion of these
genes along with the 16S rRNA and other omp genes
should enhance understanding of Ca. Liberibacter strain
diversity studies, especially in situations where the other
two conserved genes fail to differentiate the strains. Our
results also suggest that Ca. Liberibacter evolved along
with the members of the order Rhizobiales and Rhodobacteriales after the separation of the order Rickettsiales,
but branched out before the expansion of the order Rhizobiales. The comparative genomic analysis of eight of these
bacteria based on the three genomic loci cloned from the
Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus revealed overall gene order and
operon conservation with some notable differences. Especially, the selective incorporation/retention of a NDP-

website as detailed in the Methods section (Additional file 1). The corresponding matching genomic positions were 1451145–
1471145 for S. meliloti; 856122-8543524 for B. quintana; 760428–780428 for B. melitensis; 1745952–1758326 for R. etli;

Between secE and Ef-Tu proteins, the three plant symbiotic bacteria have a NDP-sugar epimerase protein (putative oxidoreductase protein; NP_385447 S. meliloti) which is absent in the other three bacteria. Further, only the Las strain has the
tRNA-meth on the opposite strand, while other bacteria (B. quintana, B. melitensis, R. palustris, M. loti, S. meliloti) encode the
tRNA/rRNA methyltransferase protein. This gene, however, was different from the cloned tRNA-meth (trmU) Las gene. On
the other hand, there is a membrane protein coding gene (terC) in A. tumefacians at that position. Similarly, none of the above
bacterial species have the genes D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase and the phosphoserine aminotransferase in the gene

indicate ongoing host adaptation. The serA gene is also
absent in the other phloem limited bacterium Buchnera
