Rapid progress on the vertebrate tree of life
Robert C Thomson*, H Bradley Shaffer

Abstract
Background: Among the greatest challenges for biology in the 21st century is inference of the tree of life. Interest
in, and progress toward, this goal has increased dramatically with the growing availability of molecular sequence
data. However, we have very little sense, for any major clade, of how much progress has been made in resolving a
full tree of life and the scope of work that remains. A series of challenges stand in the way of completing this task
but, at the most basic level, progress is limited by data: a limited fraction of the world’s biodiversity has been
incorporated into a phylogenetic analysis. More troubling is our poor understanding of what fraction of the tree of
life is understood and how quickly research is adding to this knowledge. Here we measure the rate of progress on
the tree of life for one clade of particular research interest, the vertebrates.
Results: Using an automated phylogenetic approach, we analyse all available molecular data for a large sample of
vertebrate diversity, comprising nearly 12,000 species and 210,000 sequences. Our results indicate that progress has
been rapid, increasing polynomially during the age of molecular systematics. It is also skewed, with birds and
mammals receiving the most attention and marine organisms accumulating far fewer data and a slower rate of
increase in phylogenetic resolution than terrestrial taxa. We analyse the contributors to this phylogenetic progress
and make recommendations for future work.
Conclusions: Our analyses suggest that a large majority of the vertebrate tree of life will: (1) be resolved within
the next few decades; (2) identify specific data collection strategies that may help to spur future progress; and (3)
identify branches of the vertebrate tree of life in need of increased research effort.

Background
Resolution of a well-resolved phylogeny for all species is
a central goal for biology in the 21st century. Inference
of this ‘tree of life’ has far-reaching implications for
nearly all fields of biology, from human health to conservation [1]. As efforts have shifted from primarily
morphological to molecular approaches, a number of
complex methodological issues central to the reconstruction of large phylogenies containing hundreds to
thousands of species have been identified and, in some
cases, solved [2-4]. At the most basic level, however,
progress on the tree of life is limited by data. Both the
rates at which DNA sequences are gathered and species
are sampled have increased at a dramatic pace, leading
to the now well-known exponential accumulation of
basepairs in GenBank (Figure 1a) [5]. At the same time,
the number of studies that infer and/or apply phylogenies has also grown rapidly (Figure 1b) [6]. While these

indications of progress on the tree of life are encouraging, they are indirect and fall short of quantifying the
growth of phylogenetic knowledge.
GenBank is composed of sequences stemming from a
variety of interrelated disciplines (for example, systematics, population genetics, and genomics). When combined (as in Figure 1a), these sequences form an
enormously heterogeneous pool of data, much of which
is not directly informative about phylogeny (for example,
genome re-sequencing projects). Likewise, many of the
publications summarized in Figure 1b employ previously
proposed phylogenies, or use existing data in different
ways, and may not represent new information about the
tree of life. As a discipline, phylogenetics lacks a direct
measure of the rate of progress on the tree of life and
the overall difficulty and scale of the problem of inferring the tree of life is therefore poorly characterized.
Given the massive research effort that has, and will be,
allocated toward resolving the tree of life, an understanding of the scale of the problem is important. It
appears that the pace of progress is accelerating as

methods for phylogenetic inference mature and data
become easier to collect. Inferring the rate of this progress, however, is not straightforward, though the interest in doing so is widespread [7,8]. Previous work
examining the phylogenetic signal present in large
sequence databases suggests that these resources contain
a wealth of phylogenetic information [9,10]. As a result
of the well-established practice of depositing molecular
sequences in GenBank upon publication, this database
probably represents the single biggest repository of phylogenetic data in the world, making it the most important repositories for information about progress on the
tree of life. Like any large-scale resource, the data contained in GenBank are heterogeneous in terms of quality
of annotation information, sequence lengths, taxonomy
and other key issues, which makes combining and utilizing these data on a large scale a major challenge. However, given the breadth of GenBank, and the longevity of
the database (it is now nearly 20 years old), it also
represents a unique resource for tracking phylogenetic
progress.
Here, we measure progress on the tree of life using
GenBank data for one particularly well-studied clade,
the vertebrates. Vertebrata contains over 60,000
described species and is among the most well-studied
segments of phylogenetic diversity [11]. The deeper portions of the vertebrate tree are becoming reasonably
well understood [12-19] and many of the remaining problems are nearer the tips of the tree, at the family, genus
and species levels. We, therefore, developed an automated supermatrix procedure to infer phylogenies for a
large sample of vertebrate diversity targeted at these
shallow levels of divergence (see Methods section and
Additional File 1). We applied our supermatrix approach

to track yearly progress since 1993–the year that most
data deposition in GenBank began–and document a
rapid, but skewed, rate of phylogenetic resolution across
vertebrates.
By focusing on the annual additions to the database,
we are able to measure the past rates of phylogenetic
progress and generate predictions for the completion of
a species-level vertebrate phylogeny. Further, we examine phylogenetic efforts to date, in terms of taxon and
gene sampling, and make recommendations for increasing the effectiveness of future efforts. Our complete
dataset includes 227,329 sequences from GenBank’s
core nucleotide database (release 167.0) for 100 vertebrate clades, which encompass a total of 29,237
described species. Of these species, 11,996 have at least
one sequence deposited in GenBank and so were
included in our analyses (Table 1, Additional File 2).
Using these newly estimated phylogenies, we calculate
two simple metrics of phylogenetic resolution based on
the fraction of the nodes that are resolved at the 50%
and 95% bootstrap support levels for each of the 100
clades (see Methods section). By reconstructing data
availability, and estimating trees and resolution metrics
for each clade over GenBank’s history, we track the
accumulation of vertebrate phylogenetic information
through time.

Progress on the vertebrate tree of life
Major trends

Our analyses indicate that progress on the vertebrate
tree of life has been remarkably rapid over the last 16
years, resulting in an at least 50% bootstrap support for
approximately one quarter of the nodes in the vertebrate
tree of life (Figure 1c). The increase in resolution has

Values were calculated by combining results from each of the 100 clades into nine larger groupings. ‘Proportion of species with data’ is calculated as the number
of species in each group represented by at least one sequence in our dataset, divided by the total number of species described for that group. Resolution is
calculated as the number of nodes resolved for each group divided by the number of nodes in a fully bifurcating version of the same tree for 50% and 95%
bootstrap (BP) majority rule consensus trees, respectively.

been faster than linear (linear r2 = 0.970; second-order
polynomial r2 = 0.998; P-value for significant increase in
r2 = 4.13 × 10-12) and appears to be proportional to the
increase in number of publications on phylogenetics.
When the 100 clades are pooled into major vertebrate
lineages (classes or similar taxonomic levels), several
important trends emerge (Figure 2). Among high-diversity clades (Figure 2a) phylogenetic progress has been
most rapid for tetrapods and, in particular, for mammals
and birds. However, progress has been even more striking for relatively low-diversity clades (those containing <
2% of vertebrate diversity) such as crocodilians and turtles (Figure 2b). Crocodilia, with only 23 contained species, is particularly well resolved. We recovered 80% of
the nodes in its tree (Figure 2b), 60% of which were well
supported at a bootstrap level of 95 (Table 1). This
trend is general across the clades that we sampled.
Large clades, on average, experience less research effort
per contained species than small clades, resulting in
data sets with large amounts of missing data (Figure 3)
and comparatively low resolution (Figure 2a and 2b).
Among the high-diversity vertebrate lineages, we found
three relatively distinct levels of progress. Birds and
mammals have undergone the most rapid phylogenetic
progress, with approximately 40% of each group’s tree
of life resolved (Figure 2a), followed by amphibians and
squamate reptiles (~30%) and ray-finned fishes (~15%).
Our estimate of 40% resolution of the mammal tree of
life is similar to a recent species-level analysis of most
mammal species [12], suggesting that our automated
supermatrix approach is performing reasonably well.
The study by Bininda-Emonds et al. [12] found a 46%
resolved supertree for mammalia, but included all the
deep-level nodes in the mammal tree which tend to be
better resolved than the tip level nodes and, thus,
increase the overall resolution.

lineages. Phylogenetic resolution as a proportion of the total

overall proportion of nodes resolved in vertebrata, calculated for all
species pooled; note the different scale of the y axis in panels (a)
and (b). The small decreases in resolution for the Crocodilia and
lamprey are due to stochastic effects and the small size of the
clades (see Additional File 1).

Science Foundation funding from the Assembling the
Tree of Life initiative (in 2004 for the amphibians and
in 2002 and 2003 for birds [26]), which was immediately
followed by rapid increases in phylogenetic progress.
What dataset features are associated with phylogenetic
resolution?

Figure 3 Scatterplot of dataset characteristics. Each circle
represents the characteristics of the complete 2008 data matrix
from each of 100 vertebrate clades. The number of species in the
dataset (x-axis) refers to the number of species sampled for the
clade, not the total described diversity of that clade. The number of
character refers to the number of columns (nucleotides) for that
matrix, rather than the total number of sequences sampled. The size
of each circle represents the density of each dataset measured as
the percentage of non-missing data.

Another major trend in the accumulation of vertebrate
phylogenetic knowledge is that marine clades are the
least well characterized of all major vertebrate lineages.
Ray-finned fishes are extremely diverse, containing over
half of all vertebrate species, and this may explain their
low (~14%) proportion of resolved nodes. However, the
cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays and skates) and lampreys are both species-poor (with ~1200 and ~40 species, respectively) and have a similarly low resolution
(Figure 2b), suggesting that phylogenetic progress on
marine ‘fishes’ has lagged behind the remaining vertebrates, regardless of species diversity per se. The cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises) represent the
only exception to this trend in our dataset, with 100%
species-level sampling and 61% of nodes in their tree of
life resolved (Additional Files 2 and 3).
Although progress has increased steadily for virtually
all clades, it has improved dramatically for a few groups.
Phylogenetic resolution in the amphibians was accumulating at the same slow rate as ray-finned fishes
throughout the early period of molecular systematics,
but then saw the most rapid phylogenetic progress of
any diverse clade beginning in about 2003 (Figure 2a).
This increase was probably due to a large influx of funding and several prominent studies on amphibian systematics in the last several years [16,20-25]. Both
amphibian and bird research received major National

As vertebrate phylogenetics moves forward, we can ask
what gene- and taxon-sampling features are most
strongly associated with phylogenetic resolution: such
insights should aid the community in allocating resources
for future research. For example, among the 100 clades
that we analysed, species sampling in GenBank varied
between 6% (for the Paracanthopterygii) and 100% (for
Cetacea, Crocodilia, Lemuriformes and Perrisodactyla) of
described species (Additional File 2). Regardless of the
measure (gene, taxon or character sampling), the amount
of effort has been uneven across clades (Figure 3, Table
1, Additional File 2), resulting in a correspondingly
uneven distribution of phylogenetic information (Figure
2, Table 1, Additional File 2). In order to assess the
effects of sampling patterns on phylogenetic resolution,
we performed a multiple regression of the proportion of
species sampled in a clade, the total number of species in
the clade, the average number of characters per species
and dataset density (or proportion of non-missing data)
on phylogenetic resolution for the 100 clades (r2 = 0.93,
P = 9.3 × 10-55). The proportion of species sampled in a
clade has the greatest effect on phylogenetic resolution
(partial regression coefficient 0.80), followed by dataset
density (partial regression coefficient of 0.22). Both clade
size and number of characters have smaller, but significant, impacts (partial regression coefficients of 0.10 and
0.11, respectively). Dataset density co-varies with clade
size and number of characters (Figure 3), with exceptionally large clades having both fewer characters as well as
lower dataset densities.
Are we concentrating on the best genes?

While confidence in the tree of life will ultimately come
from rigorously analysed multiple marker datasets, the
first approximations will most likely come from sparsely
sampled (at the gene- and character-level), taxonomically enriched datasets. Following the large effect of
taxon sampling, the density of these matrices appears to
have the largest effect on the resolution of the resulting
trees. To this end, researchers can help to increase the
data density in the ‘vertebrate matrix’ by focusing on a
common set of markers, in addition to clade-specific
markers. Ideally, this common set of markers should
comprise the most informative and the most commonly
used markers.
We examined sampling efforts by identifying those
genes that have been most heavily sampled for

Thomson and Shaffer BMC Biology 2010, 8:19
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/19

phylogenetic studies and asking whether those genes
also carry a strong phylogenetic signal. We selected the
most heavily studied subset of the 100 clades (defined as
clades that had been sampled for more than 20 genes, n
= 37), analysed each of the genes for these 37 clades
independently and asked which genes had received the
most sequencing effort (measured by the number of
taxa that had been sequenced) and which genes provided the most resolution (measured by the relative
amounts of resolution found in phylogenies derived
from each gene). The most frequently sampled genes
were (in decreasing order) the mitochondrial markers
cytochrome B, 12 S and 16 S ribosomal RNAs. These
mitochondrial genes were among the top five genes in
terms of taxon sampling in 89%, 76% and 73% of the
clades, respectively. The most frequently sampled
nuclear genes were recombination activating gene 1
(RAG-1), b-fibrinogen and myoglobin, which were
among the top five gene clusters in terms of taxon sampling in 22%, 19%, and 16% of the clades, respectively.
The most highly resolved gene trees in our dataset
were derived from the mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit 2 and control
region, the nuclear b-fibrinogen, aldolase B, myoglobin,
growth hormone 1 and RAG-1. Thus, among the
nuclear genes, the most heavily sampled genes were also
among the most resolved genes, although this analysis
also identifies growth hormone 1 and aldolase B as
strong candidates for the additional sequencing effort.
In the mitochondrial data, the genes with the most
resolving power were not among the most heavily
sampled. Further, the most heavily sampled mitochondrial genes did not rank near the top of mitochondrial
genes in terms of resolving power. Cytochrome b, 12 S
and 16 S ribosomal RNAs, rank at numbers 8, 9 and 10
(out of 16) in terms of the resolving power for mitochondrial genes. Despite these results, an attractive target for additional mitochondrial sequencing in
vertebrate phylogenetics is, perhaps, cytochrome oxidase
I. This gene is already the target of massive DNA barcoding efforts and ranked well in our analysis, in terms
of both species sampling (four out of 16) and phylogenetic resolution (five out of 16).
We checked that these results were not being driven
by a correlation between the number of species sampled
for a gene and phylogenetic resolution and found no
significant relationship (r2 = 0.0015, regression slope =
9.7 × 106, P = 0.15). The analysis is based on averages
across several clades and it is well known that rates of
molecular variation vary across the tree of life. Further,
these recommendations apply to studies at relatively
shallow levels of diversity (generally at the family level
and below). Thus, these genes appear to be attractive
starting points for a common gene set, although it is

unlikely that they will be the most informative genes in
all clades and certainly not at all phylogenetic scales.
Future progress on the tree of life

Extrapolations based on the last 16 years provide a framework for the discussion of the future progress on the
vertebrate tree of life. Like any extrapolation, these projections are assumption-laden and are necessarily
approximate, although they are instructive. If current
trends continue, we predict essentially complete specieslevel sampling before 2020 (Figure 4). This assumes that
all species are equally easy to sample and that no new
vertebrate species will be described, both of which are
incorrect assumptions. Presumably the last few species
of many clades will be those that are rare and/or secretive, subject to political difficulties with collecting the
data or are recently extinct. Even so, current trends predict that most species will have sequenced DNA available in roughly another decade. Although a single
sequence for a single specimen is a far cry from a complete phylogeny, our projections suggest that we will
have at least a rough phylogenetic placement, based on
molecular data, for most vertebrates in the near future.
Although projections for the resolution of the tree
itself imply slower progress, they still suggest that an
essentially fully resolved vertebrate tree of life is within
reach. Again, these projections are based on strong
assumptions, as some parts of the tree will be more

Figure 4 Projections of future progress. Projection of the bestfitting trend line for species sampling, phylogenetic resolution and
strongly supported phylogenetic resolution. Phylogenetic resolution
refers to the proportion of nodes resolved in a 50% majority rule
bootstrap consensus tree. Strong support refers to this same
measure in a 95% majority rule bootstrap consensus tree.

difficult to resolve than others (for example, those with
short branches, incongruous gene trees, etc.). If much of
the tree is difficult, and our progress to date is largely
made up of the ‘easy’ parts, future progress will take
much longer than our projections. Alternatively, if we
assume that our progress to date has been an unbiased
sample with respect to easy versus difficult nodes, then
the current rate of progress suggests that we will understand a majority of the vertebrate tree, with strong support, in the next three decades (Figure 4).

Conclusions
Progress on the vertebrate tree of life has been surprisingly rapid, increasing polynomially since the early
1990s, when molecular phylogenetic approaches became
widely used. Our analysis suggests that approximately a
quarter of the nodes in the vertebrate tree of life are
resolved with at least a moderate level of statistical support. While we expect the trends in Figure 4 to become
sigmoidal over time, it appears that a substantial fraction
of the vertebrate tree could be understood to a first
approximation in the next few decades. Given the modest progress in the first few years of molecular phylogenetic work, this recent rise in phylogenetic progress is
remarkable. The informatic pipeline that we use here
can be applied to all clades represented in GenBank and
such analyses should help determine the groups that are
in greatest need of future phylogenetic research and,
potentially, the genes that may lead most efficiently to
their resolution. As this occurs, we look forward to the
more comprehensive explorations of the patterns, processes and, perhaps most importantly, strategies for conservation that these phylogenies promise [27].
Methods
Data

We selected 100 non-overlapping clades for our analysis.
In order to do so, we chose a species at random from
the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) vertebrate taxonomy and then, for each species,
chose the largest clade that included that species but
had fewer than 500 species in the NCBI taxonomy. This
is different from the total number of species in a given
clade because the NCBI taxonomy contains only those
species that actually have a sequence deposited in GenBank. For example, if we randomly chose the snapping
turtle, Chelydra serpentina, the largest containing clade
would be all turtles (310 species in the NCBI database),
since the next most inclusive clade (Sauropsida) has
11,391, which is over 500 sampled species. The cut-off
of 500 sampled species per clade was used in order to
keep the datasets to a size that would allow tractable
analysis times and memory usage, as well as maintain
the molecular divergence present in the alignments at a

Page 6 of 8

reasonable level. For each of these clades, we downloaded all sequences in GenBank’s nucleotide core database (release 167.0) that were between 100 and 5000
basepairs in length. This excluded very short sequences
that were unlikely to be phylogenetically informative
and were difficult to align, as well as extremely large
sequences that require excessive memory in our automated pipeline. We also sought to exclude model organisms, which we defined as species for which greater than
10,000 sequences existed in the nucleotide core database, because most of the data available for these organisms is not phylogenetically informative for the scope of
this analysis. Finally, we downloaded a list of the publication dates for all sequences, as well as the taxonomy
file for each clade to use in downstream parts of the
analysis.
We filtered sequences to exclude data that are unsuitable for phylogenetic analysis (for example, microsatellites, paralogs, repetitive elements) and standardized all
taxon names contained in the deflines to the NCBI taxonomy to correct misspellings and standardize alternative taxon names. Finally, we excluded sequences that
were not unambiguously assignable to a single species
(for example, hybrids).
Clustering, alignment, and matrix assembly

We assembled the sequence data for each clade into
gene clusters by sorting the sequences with all-againstall BLAST clustering using BLASTCLUST (settings: -L
0.25 -S 75 -b T -p F -e 10E-5 -S 1). In order to assemble the yearly datasets, we pruned each cluster to
include only those sequences deposited in GenBank in
1993 or earlier, 1994 or earlier and so on through
2008; this resulted in 16 sets of sequence clusters. We
combined each set into a supermatrix using an automated pipeline based on an extension of the methods
developed in reference [28] and containing the following basic steps: We removed duplicate sequences
within clusters (that is, multiple sequences for a species from the same gene) keeping only the longest
sequence for each species. We then aligned the
sequences in each cluster using the local alignment
algorithm implemented in DIALIGN [29], followed by
the refinement algorithm from MUSCLE [30]. Next we
identified the set of all clusters that were both potentially phylogenetically informative (contained at least
four species) and overlapped with at least one other
cluster in the set by four or more species and
assembled them into a supermatrix (following [31]).
This process yielded a total of 1192 supermatrices.
Fewer than the 1600 (16 years × 100 clades) total possible supermatrices were constructed because no data
were present in GenBank for several clades during the
early years of data deposition in GenBank.

Supermatrix analysis and rogue taxa

We conducted preliminary bootstrapping analyses on
each dataset with PAUP*4.0b10 in order to identify
rogue taxa, which are known to be particularly problematic for supermatrix analyses [28,31,32]. These should
be distinguished from taxa that are phylogenetically
unstable because of true ambiguity in the data (due to a
paucity of informative characters, mutational saturation
and so on), though these two causes of phylogenetic
instability are not mutually exclusive. Allowing these
rogue taxa to remain in the analysis can have extremely
detrimental impacts on the resulting consensus trees
and so their identification and removal is essential [28].
For these preliminary analyses, we carried out 100 parsimony bootstrap replicates using a single random
sequence addition replicate, limiting the search to 50
min per dataset and storing a maximum of 1000 trees
per search. We then used these trees to calculate taxon
instability indices for each species using the headless
version of MESQUITE [33] and pruned, alternatively,
the 5% and 10% least stable taxa from each dataset,
comparing the effect of the two pruning stringencies
(see Additional File 1).
Phylogenetic analyses of the pruned datasets were carried out in PAUP* using 10 random sequence addition
replicates to search for most parsimonious trees followed by 100 bootstrap replicates each limited to 30
min (50 h total). Settings for phylogenetic analyses followed those developed in reference [28]. We counted
the number of resolved nodes in 50% and 95% majority-rule bootstrap consensus trees as a measure of phylogenetic information. In order to calculate the total
percentage of nodes in each tree that were supported,
we divided the number of resolved nodes by the total
number of nodes in a fully bifurcating tree of all
described species in that clade (N-2, where N is the
number of described species in the clade). The numbers
of described species in each clade were summed from
recent comprehensive checklists and the NCBI taxonomy files [34-41].
Single gene analyses

We selected a ‘heavily studied’ subset of the 100 clades,
defined as all clades for which at least 20 phylogenetically informative gene clusters were available, to use for
an analysis of gene performance. We took the aligned
clusters from 2008 that were combined into a supermatrix in the previous analyses and analysed them independently, as single genes. These analyses were carried out
identically to the final supermatrix analyses and we
scored phylogenetic resolution as the number of
resolved nodes in each tree divided by the number of
taxa in the tree minus two. We then chose the five largest (in terms of number of taxa sampled) and the five

Page 7 of 8

most highly resolved genes for each of these 37 clades
and analysed the performance of these markers in order
to see if the most heavily studied genes were also
among the top-performing.
Alignments and analyses were computationally intensive, requiring several months on 18 fast processors. All
automation was implemented in Perl (code available
from corresponding author) and analyses were carried
out on computers running PhyLIS [42]. We carried out
additional analyses at several steps of the automated
pipeline to ensure that the automation was working
appropriately. We checked that the tree searches were
thorough enough to avoid artificially decreasing support
and that the rogue taxon pruning did not artificially
increase support. We also verified that the automated
alignments were performing well (see Additional File 1
for a full description of the error checking analyses).
