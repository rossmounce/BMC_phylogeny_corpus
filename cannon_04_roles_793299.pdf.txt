Abstract
Background: Most genes in Arabidopsis thaliana are members of gene families. How do the
members of gene families arise, and how are gene family copy numbers maintained? Some gene
families may evolve primarily through tandem duplication and high rates of birth and death in
clusters, and others through infrequent polyploidy or large-scale segmental duplications and
subsequent losses.
Results: Our approach to understanding the mechanisms of gene family evolution was to
construct phylogenies for 50 large gene families in Arabidopsis thaliana, identify large internal
segmental duplications in Arabidopsis, map gene duplications onto the segmental duplications, and
use this information to identify which nodes in each phylogeny arose due to segmental or tandem
duplication. Examples of six gene families exemplifying characteristic modes are described.
Distributions of gene family sizes and patterns of duplication by genomic distance are also described
in order to characterize patterns of local duplication and copy number for large gene families. Both
gene family size and duplication by distance closely follow power-law distributions.
Conclusions: Combining information about genomic segmental duplications, gene family
phylogenies, and gene positions provides a method to evaluate contributions of tandem duplication
and segmental genome duplication in the generation and maintenance of gene families. These
differences appear to correspond meaningfully to differences in functional roles of the members of
the gene families.

Background
Most genes in Arabidopsis thaliana are members of gene
families. Similarity searches between all predicted proteins show that 65 – 85% of all Arabidopsis genes are
homologous to at least one other gene in the genome,
depending on similarity thresholds ([1] and analysis in

this paper). There is a wide range in gene family sizes, with
more than 400 receptor kinase genes [2,3], ~270 – 285
cytochrome P450 genes [1,4,5], and many small families
or unique genes. The dramatic variation we observe in
gene family size and distribution may be affected by many
processes, including tandem duplication with high rates

of birth and death and gene duplication resulting from
larger scale genome events such as polyploidy or duplications of large chromosomal regions (referred to in this
paper as "segmental duplications"). We provide a quantitative characterization of the gene duplication patterns
evident in the evolution of 50 large gene families in A.
thaliana.
The complete sequencing of the A. thaliana genome
revealed numerous large-scale segmental duplications
[1,6-10]. Several studies have concluded that at least two
rounds of duplications have probably occurred in the A.
thaliana genome, with many losses and rearrangements
leaving a mosaic of "segmental duplications" or "duplication blocks" [7,10-14]. Most duplication blocks appear to
have come from one round of polyploidy, estimated by
various methods to have occurred 20 – 40 Mya, before the
evolution of the genus Brassica but after the separation of
Brassicaceae from other close eudicot families [7,10-12].
The portion of the genome that exists in duplicate regions
serves as a baseline for evaluating whether genes in a given
gene family have been lost or retained at a rate higher than
expected for the genome as a whole. If most duplication
blocks did in fact originate during one round of polyploidy, this duplication could also be used to provide an
internal reference point to use in comparing the rates of
amino acid substitutions in members of different gene
families.
While polyploidy is one mechanism by which gene family
copy numbers expand, tandem or local duplication is the
most commonly evaluated mechanism for gene family
expansion. Tandem duplication often results from unequal crossing-over [15] and multiple episodes of unequal
crossovers might lead to increasing or decreasing copy
numbers in gene families, or to simple cycling of genes
without large changes in gene family size. Though not
investigated in this paper, transposable elements may also
have played an important role in gene duplications and
genome rearrangements in Arabidopsis [16].
To determine the relative importance of segmental and
local duplications in the evolution of large gene families,
we developed software to identify clades in gene family
phylogenies that have arisen either through segmental or
local duplications. In 50 large gene families in A. thaliana,
we find that contributions made by these two processes
differ greatly from gene family to gene family. We discuss
the possible biological significance of these differences in
gene family evolution.

Results
Strategy
Our general approach consisted of the following steps.
Details, parameters, and software are described in the
Methods section.

1) Choose initial gene families and preliminary sequence
membership. We began with 2001 Arabidopsis PIR superfamilies, available at MIPS [17], and refined family membership in the subsequent steps.
2) Narrow the gene family selection on the basis of
domain arrangements. We determined the Pfam [18]
domains of all sequences in each gene family, assessed the
consistency of domain arrangements in each family, and
excluded families with particularly complex domain
arrangements, such as those in several kinase families.
3) Iteratively construct and refine gene family alignments.
We constructed T-Coffee [19] alignments using a maximum of 30 genes from each family, then generated hidden Markov models (HMMs), realigned all proteins in
each family to the model, used the model to re-search the
full set of predicted Arabidopsis proteins, retrieve
sequences with expectation values less than 10-10, and realign those to the HMM.
4) Trim alignments for use in phylogenetic analyses. This
involved removing indel regions, first by removing residues falling outside of the "match states" in the HMM,
and then by visually inspecting and in some cases removing other poorly aligned or indel regions.
5) Calculate phylogenies. We generated parsimony and
bootstrapped neighbor joining trees, and also calculated
maximum likelihood branch lengths for the parsimony
topologies.
6) Predict segmental duplications in the Arabidopsis
genome, using DiagHunter [20,21]. In a two-dimensional
dot plot of amino acid similarity "hits" between chromosomes, segmental duplications appear as diagonal features. The sets of homologous gene pairs that contribute
to such features were used in the next step. Similarity is at
a BLASTP bit score threshold of 500, with other parameters described in [21].
7) Determine gene pairs in a gene family having the same
coordinates as found in a pair of duplication blocks. Any
such gene pair likely duplicated at the same time as the
pair's duplication block. We carried out this and the next
three steps using OrthoParaMap software developed for
this purpose, and described in detail at [22,23].

Figure 1
Sizes of gene families in A. thaliana
Sizes of gene families in A. thaliana Approximate gene family sizes were calculated using single-linkage clustering of
BLASTP similarities below E-value thresholds of 10-10 (red), 10-20 (black), and 10-30 (blue). At the resolution of this graph, these
lines follow nearly the same path. The curves follow a power law distribution. The best-fit power law equation for the 10-10
curve is indicated on the graph.

8) Annotate the gene phylogenies with information on
duplication block membership. Infer nodes that likely
originated through segmental duplications, and annotate
the phylogeny with this information.
9) Use gene position information to infer which closely
related genes (defined in terms of position in gene phylogenies) are located physically "close" to one another
(defined in terms of the physical distance between genes,
as described below). Infer nodes that likely originated
through tandem duplications, and annotate the phylogeny with this information.
10) Add translated EST consensus sequences from other
species to help provide additional context. This involved
using each A. thaliana sequence in each gene family to
query TIGR unigene sets for soybean, M. truncatula, Lotus
japonicus, tomato, potato, and corn, then choosing the

longest translations, aligning these to the HMM, and
recalculating the phylogenies using the same procedures
as for A. thaliana (step 5). Though generally not integral to
this project, this information was helpful in determining
evolutionary patterns for some families – and particularly
for families consisting of small, highly-expressed proteins.
Because of space constraints, figures 5, 6, 7, 8 include only
A. thaliana, Medicago, and tomato sequences, though phylogenies for all sequences are included at [24].
Study set selected from all large A. thaliana gene families
A high-throughput phylogenetic analysis of many gene
families is complicated at the start by questions of what
constitutes a gene family [25-28]. Conceptually, gene
families have a common ancestor, arise by gene duplication, and may share similar functions. The diversity of
sequence and function in gene families often makes
delimiting gene families difficult. Operationally, gene

across all five A. thaliana chromosome comparisons. The red dotted line shows the best-fit exponential equation to the wholegenome curve, fitted from 5 kb to 100 kb.

families can be defined in terms of levels of sequence similarity and domain composition, but a simple similarity
threshold may be misleading if the threshold inappropriately splits a divergent superfamily, or inappropriately
groups together separate gene families that share a common domain [25,26].
To limit the scope of this study and to avoid some of the
complexities presented by superfamilies with diverse
domain arrangements, we arbitrarily chose 50 gene families with at least 20 members, functional domains in common, and consistent family membership. Consistent
family membership was judged by distributions of expectation scores in HMM searches (using hmmer [29]) of the
A. thaliana proteome. Preference was given to families in
which there is a clean drop-off in HMM E-value, with
members having scores of at worst 10-10 and nonmembers
generally having much poorer scores. Apart from the minimum family size, we chose better-studied families,
though some have no members with known functions or
Pfam domains [18]. Lastly, we chose families with a range
of family sizes, from families of 20 members up to the

approximately 225-member cytochrome P450 superfamily (though the total number of P450 genes in A. thaliana, including members of all diverse subfamilies, is
estimated to be 275 – 285 genes [1,4,5]). The families
used in this study are shown in Table 1.
To get a sense of the distribution of gene family sizes, we
also conducted a simple whole-proteome homology
search and single-linkage clustering at two BLASTP [30]
thresholds. In this context, single linkage clustering transitively merges sets of genes in which any gene is sufficiently similar to some other gene in the set. These results
are shown in Figure 1. The distribution closely follows a
power-law (Figure 1; y = 1642.7x-0.8517, R2 = 0.96). In such
a distribution, there are few families with large numbers
of members and many families with few members. A
power-law distribution is worth noting in part because it
calls for a mechanism for the evolution and maintenance
of family sizes. Any proposed mechanism will need to be
consistent with the mechanisms of individual gene duplications and losses in various families.

Comparison of observed/expected tandem and segmental duplications for 50 large A. thaliana gene families
Figure 4
Comparison of observed/expected tandem and segmental duplications for 50 large A. thaliana gene families
Ratios of observed to expected tandem duplications in the 50 gene families in the study are shown on the vertical axis, and
ratios of observed to expected segmental duplications on the horizontal axis. For purposes of discussion, one and two standard deviations around the means on each axis are shown with a box plot. Among families outside of one standard deviation,
families with members that play roles in pathogen defense are indicated in red. Transcription factor families are shown in light
green. Several housekeeping genes are shown in dark green. Several broad-function enzyme families are shown in brown.
Notice the relative scarcity of gene families that are high in both categories, and eight families that have no apparent tandem
duplications.

Using a BLASTP E-value threshold of 10-10 (Figure 1) followed by single-linkage clustering, produces 181 potential gene families with at least 20 members, 46 with at
least 50 members, and 13 with at least 100 members. At
least 85.7% of A. thaliana genes have one or more
homologs at this threshold. Using a BLASTP threshold of
10-20, single-linkage clustering generates 140 potential
gene families with at least 20 members, 40 with at least 50
members, and 10 with at least 100 members. At least
80.6% of A. thaliana genes have one or more homolog at
this threshold. These BLAST and clustering results provide

approximate descriptions of gene family size distributions. The 50 gene families chosen for further analysis
were further refined as described in Methods.
Tandem duplications quantified
Our goal is to distinguish between gene duplication
resulting from segmental duplication of chromosomal
regions, and tandem duplication generating nearby gene
copies. This required operational definitions of both gene
similarity and genomic proximity. Similarity should be
determined in the context of the gene phylogeny because

different genes in different families evolve at different
rates. We limited the search for tandem duplications to
sequences with ≤75% of the average evolutionary distance
from terminal nodes to an approximate midpoint root in
the phylogeny, the maximum search depth. This is somewhat arbitrary cutoff, but avoids very early duplications in
the phylogenies, for which mechanisms are difficult to
infer. To determine whether two genes are physically close
enough to conclude that they probably arose through tandem duplications, we measured the average genomic distance at which there is an excess number of duplications
above the genome average.
Following the approach of Vision et al. [9], we use a dot
plot to map the occurrence of two similar sequences
located in different genome regions. Locations along the
linear sequence of genomic regions are graphed as the Xand Y-axis with each dot at an XY coordinate marking a
similarity "hit" (Figure 2). Dot plots of chromosomes
compared to themselves, e.g. chrom. 1 by chrom. 1, map
local tandem duplication as well as segmental events
within the chromosome. Segmental events are represented as dense linear arrays of dots in the same or opposite orientation as the main diagonal but located off the
main diagonal.
The density of dots in any portion of the dot plot represents the density of matches between the genome regions
being compared. If a large amount of tandem duplication
has occurred in a chromosomal region, this will be visible
as a densely dotted region near the main diagonal of a
chromosome plotted against itself. The dot plots we
present do not include the main diagonal itself (showing
the similarity of each protein to itself). The average density at any given distance between genes can be calculated
from diagonal strips through the dot plot. One strip is presented as an example in Figure 2.
Figure 3 shows the average densities of diagonal strips
through the chromosome 2 dot plot. The whole chromosome 2 comparison is shown in the left panel, and duplications within 100 kb upstream or downstream are shown
in the right panel. Chromosome 2 has no detectable internal segmental duplications by our analysis, and therefore
has the cleanest duplication plot (Figure 3, left panel),
with the peak centered on 0 representing tandem
duplications.
Breaking down the density by distance observations into
closer intervals, we next plotted density in 5 kb windows.
The graph in Figure 3b shows similar density measurements, but within 5 kb windows, from 100 kb downstream from a query to 100 kb upstream in chromosome
2. The plot obtained is very similar for all five chromosomes and Figure 3b also shows a genome average. In

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/4/10

each, we find a dramatic excess of local duplications falling within 50 kb physical distance. The units are
homologs per area, where a meaningful unit area might
be (5 kb)2. The rationale for using (5 kb)2 in the denominator is that in A. thaliana, the average gene density is
approximately one gene per 5 kb, so if all genes were
homologous, the number of homologs between any two
5 kb regions would be 1. The value of one homolog per (5
kb)2 in A. thaliana might therefore be described as one
density unit (d.u.; a term novel to this paper). As would be
expected, the highest densities of local duplications are
seen at 5 kb (Figure 3b). In windows extending from 5 kb
to 10 kb from any gene, the density of apparently
duplicated genes (BLASTP threshold of 10-10) is 0.098 d.u.
genome-wide. This means that on average, there are ~0.1
homologs within any two 5 kb windows that are separated by 5 kb, or that one duplicated gene in ten is likely
to have a homolog very close by. In the 100 kb window
centered on any gene, the corresponding density of duplicated genes is approximately 0.020 – 0.035 d.u.,
depending on the chromosome. In all chromosomes, a
clear local duplication effect is not seen beyond 50 kb.
Thus, we define tandem duplications as those closely
related genes falling within 50 kb of one another.
The distribution of densities of locally duplicated genes by
distance follows an exponential distribution (R2 value of
0.98, Figure 3). Integrating under this curve, 90% of the
area under the curve in the interval between 5 kb and 100
kb is found within the smaller interval of 5 kb to 50 kb
and represents densities above an average background
density of 0.002 d.u. Again, this supports the use of 50 kb
as a reasonable threshold for identifying local duplications in A. thaliana.
Expected values for tandem and segmental duplications
To compare the relative contributions of tandem and segmental duplications when gene families differ substantially in size, we generated expected values for tandem and
segmental duplication events for gene families of each
size class, calculated a ratio of observed to expected values
for these two mechanisms, and compared the ratios for
each family.

We simulated distributions of expected numbers of tandem duplications that would occur by chance for a gene
family of a given size in a genome of a given size. The simulation procedure is to randomly place N genes in a
100,000 kb genome (the approximate extent of euchromatic DNA in A. thaliana), and to count the number of
genes that are within 50 kb of one another. A total of 1000
simulation runs generates a distribution for each gene
family size. For small gene families, the probability that
two genes will fall near one another follows a Poisson distribution. For example, a mean and variance of 0.12

neighboring genes is observed for a 20-member gene family. For large gene families, the probability approaches a
normal distribution. For example, a mean of 4.0 neighboring genes, a variance of 15.4, and a standard deviation
of 3.92 is observed for a 100-member gene family. The
simulations provide a means of accounting for tandem
duplications expected by chance alone, against which we
compare observed values (Table 2). As we show below,
the expected values are far lower than the observed values
for most gene families because tandem duplication processes have not randomly distributed copies across the
genome.
Our goal for calculating expected numbers of segmental
duplications was to establish an easily interpretable normalizing constant (a different objective than establishing
values for a standard null hypothesis). Our assumption
was that the majority of genes resulting from segmental
duplications have been lost, and we wanted a way to compare extent of loss between families beyond the level
expected due only to the loss of large duplicate regions. By
our method of identifying segmental duplication blocks
[20,21], approximately 75% of the euchromatic portion
of the Arabidopsis genome exists in at least one duplication
block. If all genes within those duplicated regions had
been retained, then (all other factors being equal) the fraction of gene copies expected in segmentally duplicated
regions would also be 75%. In fact, the proportion of
retained gene copies is much lower than this, but 75%
provides a baseline and normalizing constant for comparing observed counts of gene copies due to segmental
duplication in gene families of different sizes (Table 2).
Counts of tandem and segmental duplications
Table 2 shows counts of tandem and segmental duplications in each family, together with ratios of these counts
to the expected genome average for tandem or segmental
counts for each family size. Other types of events,
including transpositions or remnants of segmental duplications, were not classified. The ratio of observed/
expected tandem duplication counts demonstrate an
enormous range from 0 to 63; some families are the
apparent result of no tandem duplication while one, the
Germin family, demonstrates 63 times as many gene copies in tandem arrays as would be expected by chance. The
ratio of observed/expected segmental duplication events
range from 0 to 0.52; some families have lost all segmental duplicates predicted by the model, while some have
lost only about half the duplicates predicted by the model.
Table 2 presents gene families grouped by low, medium,
and high ratios of observed/expected tandem duplication
events, and then grouped by low, medium, and high
ratios of observed/expected segmental duplication events.
To generate these classes, cutoffs are set at one standard
deviation above and below the median. Several families

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/4/10

in the tandem and segmental categories also fall above
two standard deviations, and these are also indicated in
Table 2.
Gene families represented in Table 2 tend either to fall
into high-tandem/low-segmental duplication classes or
vice versa as is evident in the moderate negative correlation found in a plot of expected/observed segmental and
tandem duplications (correlation coefficient = -0.47; R2 =
0.22; p = 0.00057 for ANOVA F-statistic; Figure 4). Among
the eight low-tandem duplication families, none are in
the low-segmental duplication category, and two of the
eight have segmental duplication counts that place them
approximately two standard deviations above the segmental-duplication median. Among the eight low-segmental duplication families, none are in the low-tandem
duplication category, and five fall more than one standard
deviation above the median ratio of observed/expected
tandem-duplication events. There are gene families such
as PR1 and CatHydExch with high numbers of segmental
or tandem duplications compared to that expected, but
not high numbers of both. Neither the ratios of observed/
expected tandem events nor the ratios of observed/
expected segmental duplications are correlated with gene
family size (the R2 values are 0.044 and 0.066, with p-values 0.14 and 0.08, respectively).
In our set of 50 gene families, the low-tandem duplication
class appears to be represented by highly conserved,
housekeeping or key regulatory gene families, while the
medium- and high-tandem duplication classes are
represented by families involving pathogen defense or
diverse enzymatic functions. Families involved in pathogen defense all fall in the medium- or high-tandem duplication classes; the NBS-LRR [31,32], Thaumatin [33],
Germin [34,35], PR1 [36], and Major Latex Protein/PR10
families [37]. The low-tandem duplication class includes
two of the three transcription factor families (heat shock
and WRKY) and some housekeeping gene families (mitochondrial carrier proteins [38,39], proteasome 20S subunit family [40,41]).
Gene phylogenies from multiple species
Some phylogenies that include only A. thaliana sequences
appear to have long internal branches – potentially indicating rapid evolution. Addition of homologous
sequences from other species provides a means of testing
whether genes in these families have evolved rapidly, or
whether long internal branches indicate ancient differences between highly conserved protein sequences. This
approach is shown in Figure 5, a phylogeny of the 20S
proteasome subunit family [41,42]. The right-hand phylogeny includes representatives from three species: A. thaliana, tomato, and M. truncatula. The tight clustering of
sequences at the end of long internal branches indicates

Page 14 of 21
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Plant Biology 2004, 4

that this family consists of highly conserved amino acid
sequences that have been retained in these genomes for
extended times – though it should be said that taxa represented here are fairly closely related dicotyledons, and
sequences from basal angiosperms or gymnosperms
would likely be placed much more deeply in the phylogeny. Similarly, sequences from multiple species were also
used for comparisons shown in Figures 7 and 8.
The multi-species approach taken here generally provides
qualitative rather than quantitative measures of evolutionary patterns. For tomato and Medicago, we used translated EST tentative consensus (TC) sequences, which are
error-prone. Nevertheless, for gene families with highlyexpressed, relatively short transcripts, the information
gives estimates of minimum evolutionary distances
between A. thaliana and other dicot gene homologs.

Discussion
This paper describes differences in the relative importance
of tandem and segmental duplication to the size and evolution among large gene families in the A. thaliana
genome. Tandem duplications are clearly an important
engine generating new gene copies in genomic clusters,
where unequal crossovers generate new diversity. Segmental duplication events have a different effect as they may
widely disperse gene copies throughout the genome
where they experience few recombinational exchanges
with parental copies [43]. To study the joint effects of
these genome processes on multigene family evolution,
we placed gene families into low, medium, and high tandem duplication classes and low, medium, and high segmental duplication classes, and investigated attributes of
some better-studied families within each duplication
class.
Distribution of gene family sizes
The frequency distribution of A. thaliana gene family sizes
closely follows a power-law relationship (Figure 1). A
plausible explanation for this distribution in other
genomes was proposed by Huynen and van Nimwegen
[44]. In their model, gene families are founded by a single
ancestor, and through duplications and deletions, the
family size fluctuates over time, with the possibility of the
family going extinct from the genome. The requirements
of the model are that all members in a family have the
same probability of duplication or loss at any given time,
different gene families may have different probabilities at
any given time, and the average of all duplication probabilities is less than one (preventing gene families from
growing to infinity). Under these general conditions, the
model generates a power-law distribution of the sizes of
surviving gene families [44-46] and thus, selection need
not be invoked to explain gene copy number distribution
per se.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/4/10

Still, our observations show that since the time of segmental events (the most recent of which is estimated to have
occurred 20 – 40 Mya [7,9,12], varying numbers of gene
copies have been maintained in segmentally duplicated
regions across different gene families. For example, gene
copies generated by segmental duplication are more often
retained following polyploidy in the more slowly-evolving MYB gene family (Table 2, [24]) whereas, in the large,
rapidly-evolving NBS-LRR disease resistance family,
duplication in local genomic clusters is common with surprisingly low retention of segmental duplications. Below,
we consider the possible biological significance of gene
duplication patterns for each class of gene families.
Low tandem, low segmental duplication
Eight gene families were classified as low-tandem duplication and of these, most fell in the moderate or high segmental duplication classes. A few families demonstrating
low tandem duplication levels also demonstrate relatively
low segmental duplication levels compared to a genomewide average. The mitochondrial carrier protein family
(MC or MCP [38,39]) and heat shock transcription factor
family [47] each have retained few segmental duplications
and yet demonstrate no apparent tandem duplications or
a clustered organization. The MC proteins serve as antiporters, preferentially exchanging one solute for another
[38,39,48]. Structurally characterized members of the MC
family are dimers. Conceivably, additional gene copies
might disrupt the stoichiometry of protein dimers in these
transmembrane complexes, particularly once duplicated
genes were lost following polyploidy. It remains to be
tested whether gene duplication and loss patterns in
members of protein complexes generally differ from patterns for monomeric proteins.

It is likely that a relatively large portion of the variance in
the segmental losses across the 50 gene families is a result
of the stochastic process of genomic loss following polyploidy and thus, will appear a more course-grained process than tandem duplication and loss. In Arabidopsis,
many megabase duplication blocks have been retained,
while other very large regions have been lost. In any case,
the more extreme cases of very high or very low apparent
segmental duplication warrant further description below;
the high-segmental duplications for the proteasome 20S
subunit family and the low-segmental duplications for the
NBS-LRR family. These have observed/expected segmental
ratios of 0.41 and 0.05, respectively.
Low tandem, high segmental duplications
A large proportion of the families in or near the low-tandem duplication class also fall in the high-segmental
duplication class (Table 2). These include proteins
involved in a variety of roles: transcription factors (MYB),
signalling (GTP binding proteins, calmodulin,

phosphoprotein phosphatase), various enzymatic functions (glycosyl transferase, plastocyanin), membrane
transport (major intrinsic protein), and cellular housekeeping roles (Proteasome 20S subunits).
The proteasome 20S subunit family provides an interesting case study with which to consider possible constraints
on duplication processes and gene copy numbers [22,23].
In eukaryotes, the proteasome recycles proteins by degradation of ubiquitin-tagged proteins [41,42]. It is a large
protein complex, consisting of a 28-subunit catalytic
cylindrical structure, called the 20S proteasome, and an
ATP-dependent 19S regulatory particle consisting of an
additional set of approximately 18 subunits [49]. The 20S
proteasome is made up of four stacked rings. The two
middle rings are each composed of seven 20S beta
polypeptides, and these rings are sandwiched between
two alpha rings, each composed of a ring of seven
polypeptides, giving an 7α 7β 7β 7α structure [42]. In
most eukaryotes described to date, each of the seven alpha
and seven beta subunits is somewhat different from one
another, requiring 14 types of proteasome subunits to
make up the 20S proteasome [50].
In the A. thaliana 20S proteasome there are 23 genes
encoding 20S proteasome subunits [40,41,51,52] – rather
than 14. The phylogeny in Figure 5 suggests the origin of
the additional subunits. There are two large clades of 20S
proteasome sequences, each representing the alpha or
beta subunits and each alpha or beta clade is composed of
seven clades or lineages representing different alpha (or
beta) sequences [40,42] (Figure 5). Interestingly, it
appears that there are two, nearly complete sets of alpha
and beta subunits because rather than the expected 14
sequences, we find 23 sequences comprised of nine pairs
(18 total) plus five as singletons. We identified seven
instances of segmental duplication on the tree, and the
short branch lengths for two additional pairs suggest that
these also may represent remnants of the same, recent,
polyploidy event (Figure 5).
The scenario suggested by the combination of biological,
phylogenetic, and genome contextual information is that
following a round of genome doubling, roughly 20–40
Mya [7,10-12], most members of the duplicated proteasome subunits have been maintained but that five copies
have been lost. There are no tandem duplications in this
gene family, thus these two, nearly complete sets of 20S
subunits were apparently generated by segmental duplication alone. Maintenance of seven alpha and beta lineages
suggests maintenance of the stoichiometry of the 20S
components, while tolerance of duplicated subunits
might provide greater regulatory or catalytic flexibility
[49]. Moore and Purugganan [53] describe precedence for
positive selection driving the fixation and preservation of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/4/10

at least some duplicate genes in Arabidopsis. Whatever the
cause of higher-than-expected retention of segmental
duplicates in the Proteasome subunit family, this pattern
contrasts with the following example in NBS-LRR resistance genes, which shows rapid turnover of gene family
members and loss of major gene lineages in some plant
families.
Moderate tandem, low segmental duplication
Three families in the moderate-tandem duplication class
are also in the low-segmental duplication class: a protein
phosphatase family, an acyltransferase family, and the
NBS-LRR disease resistance family. The NBS-LRR disease
resistance gene family contains 152 members in A. thaliana by our HMM-search criteria. Members of the family
have been shown to confer resistance to a wide variety of
pathogens [31,32,54-56] and are of tremendous economic importance so, we focus on these as an example
here.

We found 54 tandem duplication events and six segmental duplication events on the tree. For one of the largest
clades, the 60-member RPP5-containing clade in the TIR
subfamily, we identified 25 tandem duplications within
this single RPP5 clade, 24 of which occur after segmental
duplications. The segmental duplications map to
duplication blocks dated to the recent round of polyploidy and estimated to have occurred after the separation
of Brassicaceae from other dicot families, roughly 20 – 40
Mya [10,57]. Given that no close homologs outside of
Brassicaceae species [31] have been found to date for the
RPP5 family, a likely scenario is that a RPP5 ancestral
sequence underwent tandem and perhaps another transposing duplication, was subsequently amplified via
polyploidy, and then experienced multiple rounds of tandem duplication.
In the NBS-LRR resistance gene family, Baumgarten et al.
[43] find that segmental duplications largely explain the
genome-wide distribution of NBS-LRR homologs. Here,
we extend these findings to show that tandem duplications and losses play the dominant role in affecting copy
number, as in the expansion of the RPP5 homologs. In fact,
net gene loss following polyploidy, coupled with dynamic
expansion and loss, could lead to quite variable numbers
of sequences in any given clade. Across the very large NBSLRR gene family, we observe several clades for which we
could demonstrate few or no tandem duplications [31].
Perhaps the most dramatic example of sequence loss is the
complete lack of TIR NBS-LRR sequences in the Poaceae,
despite abundant sequence for both the grasses and the
NBS-LRR gene family [32,58]. The absence of TIR
sequences in the grasses has to be inferred as a loss of this
sequence type from the grasses because TIR homologs
have been found in pine [31] and moss [59]. Just as

Page 16 of 21
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Plant Biology 2004, 4

certain clades have expanded rapidly, such as the RPP5
clade, other lineages such as the entire TIR subfamily in

High tandem, low segmental duplication
Among the 11 high- or very-high tandem duplication
families, five are in the low-segmental duplication class,
and four other families demonstrate a lower than median
level of segmental duplications. The high tandem, low to
moderate segmental duplication families fall into several
broad functional categories. Two families in which the
level of tandem duplication is more than two standard
deviations above the genome median are the germin and
major latex protein (MLP) families. Both families are
involved in pathogen defense as well as other functions.
Germins have been found to play a variety of roles,
including cell wall formation during germination, stressrelated signaling, production of active oxygen species, and
degradation of oxalate presented as a fungal toxin [60,61].
Other families with members shown to have roles in
defense against pathogens are the subtilisin-like serine
proteases and the pathogen-related PR1 family [36]. In
contrast to the apparent advantage of diverse defense
sequences, why might the chlorophyll a-b binding (CAB)
family have retained high numbers of tandem duplications? A priori, the CAB family might be expected to evolve
much more conservatively than the very highly duplicated
defense-related families because these proteins form the
large multi-protein complexes of photosystems I and II
[62]. We will describe the unusual CAB family first and
then the MLP family.
High tandem, low segmental duplication, example 1: CAB
The CAB proteins are components of the complex multisubunit photosystems I and II (PS I and PS II) [63,64].
Both photosystems consist of a chlorophyll-binding core,
and a peripheral antenna or light harvesting complex
(LHC). In addition to the light-harvesting function, the
antenna is able to dissipate excess energy through a process called feedback de-excitation [65]. There are at least 10
distinct types of proteins in the LHCs for PS I and PS II
[62,64], encoded by the nuclear lhc genes. The basic structure of photosystems have been conserved since the evolution of early land plants [62,64]. Four lhc genes
associated with PS I are denoted lhca1-4. Genes associated
with PS II are denoted lhcb1-6, and lhcb1 and lhcb2 can
also associate with PS I [62-64,66]. Although the basic
structure of photosystems have been conserved since the
evolution of early land plants [62,64], our results show
surprisingly dynamic copy numbers, especially for lhcb1,
lhcb2, and lhcb3.

Figure 7 shows a phylogeny for the A. thaliana CAB family
(left side) and for comparison, a phylogeny that also
includes consensus ESTs from tomato and M. truncatula

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/4/10

(right side). In the A. thaliana gene phylogeny, four tandem duplications and the one segmental duplication were
detected in the clade that contains lhcb1, lhcb2, and lhcb3.
In the three-species gene phylogeny, there are multiple
lhcb1, lhcb2, and lhcb3 homologs in both tomato and Medicago. These paralogs show recent independent expansions in each species lineage to generate sets of paralogs
more similar to one another than to homologs from
another species. In the A. thaliana lhcb1 clade, for example, there are five paralogs that have arisen through three
tandem duplications following divergence of Brassicaceae, and one segmental duplication prior to divergence
of Brassicaceae. In the corresponding clade of the three
species gene tree, there are at least 11 tomato sequences,
with six arising before the tomato/A. thaliana split, and at
least six Medicago sequences, with one arising before the
Medicago/A. thaliana split. Similar phylogenetic patterns
are apparent in EST data for corn, soybean, and potato
(not shown). In contrast, none of the lhca genes nor the
lhcb4-6 genes show recent amplification of gene copy
number.
There appear to be different evolutionary modes at work
in different parts of the CAB family. The phylogeny suggests high rates of turnover in the lhcb1-3 genes and low
turnover with possible loss of segmental duplicates in the
other lhc genes. Structural and functional studies show
that in PS II, a dimer of the core complexes is flanked by
two proteins each encoded by lhcb4, lhcb5, and lhcb6.
These, in turn, are flanked by a total of four trimers of
lhcb1, lhcb2, and lhcb3 [64,67,68]. Lhcb4 is essential to formation of a functioning PS II, but functional
photosystems are still formed if expression of lhcb1 and
lhcb2 is inhibited [67,68] and transcription of lhcb5 is
strongly upregulated. However, Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 proteins
do play important roles in low light conditions [64] and
in establishing the proper formation of grana stacks, and
Lhcb5 can not entirely compensate for these functions
[64]. Thus, the evolutionary flexibility of lhcb1-lhcb3 genes
may provide a mechanism to tune the light harvesting
complex for different light conditions [65], while in contrast, the genomically dispersed and evolutionarily more
stable, lhcb4, lhcb5, and lhcb6 genes maintain the photosynthetic core of PS II.
The Major Latex Protein (MLP) family encodes proteins
that were originally isolated from the latex of opium
poppy [69,70] but also found in a wide range of plants
and tissues [71]. Functions of MLP are not known, but
they do show significant similarity to a pathogenesisrelated proteins (IPR or PR10 proteins [37]) which show
increased expression with pathogen or stress challenge
[37,72-74]. Members of the two gene families (MLP and
IPR-PR10) show only about 25% identity to each other,
but sequence and structural analyses indicate that they are

BMC Plant Biology 2004, 4

similar enough to be considered to be part of a single
superfamily [37]. Interestingly, there are no A. thaliana
homologs that group with the IPR-PR10 subfamily [37],
but we located 11 tandem and three segmental duplications for the MLP family (Figure 8), resulting in a tandem
duplication observed/expected ratio of 54.5 and segmental duplication observed/expected ratio of 0.16.
Evolutionary distances among sequences resulting from
the predicted segmental duplications are greater in the
MLP than among segmentally duplicated sequences in the
proteasome family. In the MLP family, pairwise distances
among segmentally duplicated sequences range from
about 15 to 60 PAM units [75], but in the proteasome 20S
family, range from 0 to about 4 PAM. Nevertheless, the
MLP duplications do appear to come from the same polyploidy event as the proteasome duplications (Blanc et al.
[6,10]). Clearly, the MLP members have been evolving
much more rapidly following polyploidy than have the
proteasome 20S subunits or most members of the CAB
family. As above, we used Medicago and tomato sequences
to mark divergence times and the results support duplication due to a recent polyploidy event in Arabidopsis.
Patterns of gene duplication
We observed a moderate negative correlation between levels of predicted tandem and segmental duplications in
gene families. If either sequence variation or gene copy
number must be maintained within some bounds, one
possible source of selection against tandem duplication is
that unequal cross-over and gene loss will generate variation and high turn-over of gene copies [15,76].
Conversely, segmental duplicates may be more often
retained due to subfunctionalization, without increasing
the likelihood of gene rearrangment [77,78]. In families
that demonstrate moderately high levels of segmental and
tandem duplication, gene family members have been
retained within segmental duplication blocks, while gene
copy number in some clades has been expanded by tandem duplication. An example is found in flavin-containing monooxygenase family, which has six segmental
duplications at various nodes in the tree, and seven tandem duplications accounting for members of one clade.
Another example includes the chlorophyll a/b binding
protein family. On the other end of the spectrum, we
found few families in our study set with both low segmental and low tandem duplication. No families fall below
one standard deviation below the median in both the segmental and tandem categories, but several are close: the
mitochondrial carrier proteins and the heat shock transcription factor families have 9% and 13% of the expected
segmental duplications, respectively. Conceivably, protein copy stoichiometry is critical in some families representing multi-subunit protein complexes [77,78].

Conclusions
The relative contributions of tandem and segmental
duplication to the generation and maintenance of 50 large
A. thaliana gene families was characterized using ratios of
observed/expected tandem duplication and observed/
expected segmental duplication. Counts of tandem and
segmental duplications were negatively correlated; no
families exhibited both high levels of tandem and
segmental duplication. Although the distribution of gene
family sizes across the genome can be accounted for by a
stochastic model, by comparing the relative levels of tandem and segmental duplication in large gene families, we
can speculate that gene function might feedback on copy
number and genome organization, and thus result in the
widely varying patterns of observed tandem and segmental duplication.

Methods
Gene family selection, alignment, and phylogeny
construction
Initial candidate gene families were identified using 2001
A. thaliana PIR superfamilies [79], based on the 2001
MIPs A. thaliana predicted proteins [80]. Though helpful,
these were found to be somewhat inconsistent, splitting
some families unnecessarily and producing some with
overlapping membership. Families initially considered
contained at least 20 genes and, where Pfam [18] domains
were identifiable, had at least one Pfam domain (E-value
< 0.01) in common across all gene family members and
the organization of domains was consistent throughout
the family. Initial selection of gene family members was
conducted using the TIGR 2001 predicted A. thaliana proteins. All alignments, phylogenies, and analyses were
recalculated based on newer gene predictions (the 2003
TIGR A. thaliana release 4.0).

Predicted proteins for all gene families were aligned using
T-Coffee [19] and a maximum of 30 randomly selected
proteins sequences from each family. These initial alignments were used to create HMMs, which were in turn used
to re-align the full protein sets. HMM parameters in
hmmer [29] were: "hmmbuild --archpri .7 --fast -- gapmax
.3". The HMMs were calibrated using hmmcalibrate, and
then were used to search the full set of predicted A. thaliana protein sequences, using the hmmsearch program in
hmmer [29]. Sequences scoring at least 10-10 were generally retained as gene family members and genes scoring
worse than this threshold were excluded, although scores
were evaluated in the context of all scores in the putative
gene families. Families with gradually declining scores in
the range of 0.1 – 10-15 were generally excluded from the
study because the difficulty in unambiguously assigning
family membership.

Alignments were prepared for use in phylogenetic reconstructions as follows. To remove highly variable or indel
regions, sequence positions falling outside of HMM
match states were removed. Genes matching fewer than
75% of the remaining positions were removed entirely.
Alignments were also manually inspected, and other particularly poorly aligning regions were removed. Both fulllength and trimmed sequences for all gene families are
available at [24].
Parsimony and bootstrapped neighbor joining trees were
calculated for each gene family. Parsimony trees were calculated using protpars in the Phylip suite [81]. The input
sequence order was jumbled five times, and a topology
calculated based on each data order. One most-parsimonious tree was chosen at random to serve as the basis for
branch length calculations. Maximum likelihood branch
lengths were calculated on the parsimony topologies
using TreePuzzle [82]. The model of substitution was of
Adachi and Hasegawa [83], amino acid frequencies were
calculated from the input trees, and rate heterogeneity was
allowed with four Gamma rate categories. Neighbor joining trees were calculated using Clustalw, without the
Kimura distance correction, and with 1000 bootstrap replicates. All trees are available at [24].
Prediction of A. thaliana duplication blocks and gene
family segmental and tandem duplications
Internal genomic duplications were predicted using DiagHunter [20,21]. All duplication block predictions (genes,
genomic coordinates, and dot plot images of genomic
similarities and predicted duplications) are available at
[24]. Predictions of segmental or tandem duplications in
gene families were made using the OrthoParaMap suite
[22,23].

The approach for identifying segmental duplicates consists of identifying pairs of sufficiently similar genes in a
phylogeny that fall sufficiently close to their respective
corresponding regions in a synteny block. Pairs of gene
family members falling within a synteny block are annotated as such in the phylogeny, using the extended New
Hampshire (NHX) format [84]. For all but the 13 largest
gene families, the threshold for "sufficiently similar" was
set at 10-25, and the threshold for "sufficiently close" was
set at 50 kb. Because the number of potential false positive
hits to a synteny block rises approximately proportionally
to the square of the number of genes in a gene family,
more stringent thresholds ("similar" = 10-30 and "close" =
30 kb) were used for the following families (see Table 1
for full names): CytP450, MATE, MFS, Myb, NBS-LRR,
WRKY, GSDLLipase, GTPBP, MajIntrins, Prot, Oxidored,
Polygalns, SCDehydRed, UDPGlycTnsf.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/4/10

Nodes giving rise to tandem gene duplications were
inferred using the ParaMap program in the OrthoParaMap
suite [22,23]. This recursively walks through the tree,
identifying internal nodes that give rise to genes or other
nodes that are physically near one another (<50 kb) on
the chromosome.
Calculation of gene family size distributions
All predicted proteins were used in a BLASTP [30] search
against one another, using three different E-value thresholds (10-10, 10-20, and 10-30). BLAST results were parsed
using a BioPerl [85] – based script. Approximate gene
families were constructed using a single linkage clustering
approach implemented in Perl. The 2003 TIGR A. thaliana
4.0 assembly and protein predictions were used for these
procedures.
Calculation of gene duplication densities by distance
Predicted protein sequences in the 2003 TIGR A. thaliana
4.0 assembly were assigned genomic positions based on
the nucleotide position halfway between the predicted 5'
and 3' positions. Protein sequences from each chromosome were used in BLASTP [30]searches against all other
sequences in that chromosome, to give lists of BLAST hits
and query/target midpoint positions for each chromosome. Hits to self were excluded.
Calculation of expected tandem and segmental
duplications
Tandem duplications expected to occur by chance in a
gene family of a given size were simulated under the
assumption of a 100,000 kb genome (approximately the
size of the A. thaliana euchromatic genome). Gene families of sizes ranging from 20 to 230 genes were simulated,
using size classes in increments of 10. Approximate distributions were calculated using 1000 simulation runs for
each gene family size class.

Normalizing constants for segmental duplications in gene
families of given sizes were calculated under the assumption that the maximum proportion of segmental duplications retained in an average gene family should be the
same as the percentage of the genome that exists "In
duplicate" (in synteny blocks). Arithmetic for the proportion of expected segmental duplicates (in the absence of
local gene losses or duplications following polyploidy) is
shown in the Results section.
