Abstract
Background: Drosophila melanogaster females have two X chromosomes and two autosome
sets (XX;AA), while males have a single X chromosome and two autosome sets (X;AA).
Drosophila male somatic cells compensate for a single copy of the X chromosome by
deploying male-specific-lethal (MSL) complexes that increase transcription from the X
chromosome. Male germ cells lack MSL complexes, indicating that either germline
X-chromosome dosage compensation is MSL-independent, or that germ cells do not carry
out dosage compensation.
Results: To investigate whether dosage compensation occurs in germ cells, we directly
assayed X-chromosome transcripts using DNA microarrays and show equivalent expression
in XX;AA and X;AA germline tissues. In X;AA germ cells, expression from the single X
chromosome is about twice that of a single autosome. This mechanism ensures balanced
X-chromosome expression between the sexes and, more importantly, it ensures balanced
expression between the single X chromosome and the autosome set. Oddly, the inactivation
of an X chromosome in mammalian females reduces the effective X-chromosome dose and
means that females face the same X-chromosome transcript deficiency as males. Contrary to
most current dosage-compensation models, we also show increased X-chromosome
expression in X;AA and XX;AA somatic cells of Caenorhabditis elegans and mice.
Conclusions: Drosophila germ cells compensate for X-chromosome dose. This occurs by
equilibrating X-chromosome and autosome expression in X;AA cells. Increased expression of
the X chromosome in X;AA individuals appears to be phylogenetically conserved.

Background
In most organisms, copy number at any given locus has
little effect on proper organismal function. Very few genes
are deleterious if present in only one copy (haploinsufficiency) or are overtly deleterious in three copies. Having
more or fewer copies (aneuploidy) of a large fraction of the
genome is, however, invariably incompatible with viability.
For example, over 10% of human oocytes are aneuploid,
but with a few exceptions none of these aneuploid oocytes
gives rise to viable offspring [1]. The most common aneuploid genotypes in a wide range of species involve the deletion or duplication of a chromosome or chromosome
segment. Deletions are the most deleterious.
In Drosophila melanogaster, a systematic study of aneuploids
with deletions of different segments of chromosomes indicates that having only a single copy of 1% of the genome
reduces viability (and often fertility) and having only a
single copy of 3% or more of the genome is lethal [2]. From
current estimates of gene content in Drosophila, 3% represents about 500 genes [3]. Therefore, having only a single
copy of 500 genes or more usually results in the collapse of
a major part of the genetic network. That genetic networks
do indeed collapse because of minor differences in the
expression levels of a few connected nodes is evident from
genetic interaction studies. In the female germline, for
example, the dose of the gene ovarian tumor (otu) strongly
modifies the sterility phenotype of flies heterozygous for
ovoD [4]. (The gene ovo encodes a transcription factor that
acts on otu [5]). Similarly, in the male germline, heterozygosity for haywire or ␤-tubulin mutations are tolerated, but
heterozygosity for both results in failed spermatogenesis [6].
The sex chromosomes represent an extraordinary exception
to the genetic imbalance rule. Drosophila males have one
copy of the X chromosome per diploid set of autosomes
(X;AA) and females have two (XX;AA) [7]. As the Drosophila
X chromosome bears about 20% of the genome [3],
Drosophila males vastly exceed the usual 3% single-copy
threshold for viability. This is not due to an underrepresentation of dosage-sensitive genes on the X chromosome, as
females are sensitive to X-chromosome deletions [2]. Therefore, males have a special mechanism(s) to compensate for
X-chromosome dose (for reviews see [8,9]). An extensive set
of autoradiographic experiments on the giant polytene
chromosomes of the salivary gland showed that the X chromosome in X;AA flies is expressed at roughly twice the level
as an X chromosome in XX;AA flies. Hypertranscription of
the X chromosome in karyotypic males is dependent on a
complex of at least five proteins and two non-coding RNAs.
The genes encoding the proteins in the complex are referred
to as the male specific lethal (msl) loci. Males lacking any of
the msl activities show reduced X-chromosome transcription

http://jbiol.com/content/5/1/3

and die as larvae. At the molecular level, these genes encode
a histone-modifying MSL complex, which acetylates histone
4 on lysine 16 (H4 K16). The modification is thought to
relieve the general repressive action of histones and result in
increased transcription.
Interestingly, the MSLs do not function in the germline. The X
chromosomes of male germ cells are not decorated with MSL
complexes and are not hyperacetylated at H4 K16 [10]. Furthermore, neither the genes encoding the MSL complex nor
the obligate somatic regulators of the MSLs are required for
germline viability [11,12]. There is similar lack of evidence of
dosage compensation in the germline of other organisms
[13,14], leading to the hypothesis that germ cells are dosagetolerant. Alternatively, dosage compensation in germ cells
may be MSL-independent. Whether the germline X chromosome of Drosophila, or indeed of any organism, is dosage
compensated is one of the major unresolved issues in the
study of sex chromosomes. Our array results indicate that
Drosophila germ cells do, in fact, dosage compensate.
Equally enigmatic are the dosage-compensation systems in
Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals, which are based on
reducing X-chromosome expression in XX;AA cells [15,16].
This is seen most clearly in mammals, where one of the X
chromosomes in XX;AA females is inactivated. In C. elegans,
both the X chromosomes in XX;AA hermaphrodites show
reduced expression. In both cases, the dosage-compensation
model equilibrates X-chromosome expression between the
sexes but it also makes both sexes functionally aneuploid
with respect to the autosomes. Both males and females (or
hermaphrodites) become functionally X;AA. It has been suggested that this is counterintuitive, as within each diploid
X;AA organism, gene expression from a single X chromosome
should be equilibrated and balanced to the autosomes
[17-20]. Therefore, it is more useful to think of X-chromosome dosage as a mechanism for equilibrating X chromosome and autosome expression, rather than as only a
mechanism for equilibrating expression between the sexes.
This predicts, for example, that in mammals both the single X
chromosome of males and the single active X chromosome in
females are hypertranscribed [17,18]. While there is an overwhelming literature supporting X-chromosome inactivation,
there has been very little experimental evidence to support
hypertranscription of the active X chromosome [21]. Our
examination of array results in C. elegans and the mouse suggests that such X-chromosome hypertranscription does occur.

Results
Comparing XX;AA and X;AA expression ratios
Gene expression in XX;AA and X;AA tissues can be simply
visualized by plotting the hybridization intensities of the

two samples in a scatterplot (Figure 1). There is modest
sex-biased expression in the soma, but extensive sex-biased
expression in the gonads. In the absence of dosage compensation, we would expect to see XX tissue expression at
twice the level of X tissues. There is no evidence of such a
distribution of X-chromosome expression ratios in either
tissue. The bulk of the XX versus X expression data points
overlies the bulk of the AA versus AA expression data
points in both tissues. This indicates that the single X chromosomes of X;AA soma and gonads are expressed at the
same level as the two X chromosomes in XX;AA soma and
gonads. This strongly suggests that somatic dosage compensation is widespread in adult tissues. More importantly,
this provides the first strong evidence that X-chromosome
dosage compensation occurs in the germline. It is,
however, much more difficult to look for subtle effects of
gene dose in the germline because of the dramatic and
extensive sex-biased expression observed between ovaries
and testes: this sex bias affects about 31% of the genome
and results in a greater than tenfold difference in expression level for some genes.

To avoid distortion due to sex-biased expression, we included
sex-transformed tissues in our experiments (see Materials and
methods). These tissues were produced by genetic manipulation of the sex-determination hierarchy (Figure 2, and see
[7,22] for reviews). We use gonad samples to assay germline
dosage compensation. Although both wild-type and transformed gonads are composed of germline and somatic
tissues, germline cytoplasm accounts for the bulk of the
mRNA [4,11,23]. We confirmed that the germline contributes
the majority of the transcripts in these hybridizations, as we
were unable to extract sufficient RNA from similar numbers
of dissected empty gonads [24]. More importantly, we
directly verified the composition of the sample gonads by
looking for clusters of genes with germline-biased expression
and for individual genes with known germline-specific or
germline-biased expression patterns (Figure 3). These
samples allow us to isolate the effect of X-chromosome dose
from the confounding effects of sexual dimorphism.
Scatter in the XX;AA versus X;AA data due to sex-biased expression can be very effectively reduced by sex transformation

(Figure 4). When we compare expression of XX;AA and
X;AA soma that were sexually matched (for example,
females versus males transformed into females, and males
versus females transformed into males), we observe very
little high-magnitude differential expression. Even more
striking is the similarity in the expression profiles of transformed ovaries bearing non-differentiating germ cells. The
high-magnitude differences in expression observed between
wild-type XX;AA ovaries and X;AA testes (Figure 1) are
nearly abolished when we compared XX;AA and X;AA transformed ovaries (Figure 4). The implications from visual
examination of the scatterplots are clear, as hybridization to
array elements corresponding to X-chromosome and autosomal genes show expression ratios centered tightly on
unity. We confirmed the veracity of this exploratory analysis
using multiple statistical tools (see the section Transcriptional response to altered autosomal gene dose, below).
This strongly supports the idea that X-chromosome dosage
compensation occurs in the germline.
It is formally possible that X chromosomes are dosage
compensated in XX;AA versus X;AA transformed germ cells
but not in wild-type oogenic and spermatogenic germ cells.
Although most of the data points lie along the diagonal in
scatterplots of hybridization intensities comparing XX;AA
ovaries and X;AA testes, regression lines for X chromosome
and autosome expression profiles are differentially
deflected (Figure 5). This is caused by the large number of
genes showing male-biased expression on the autosomes

Volume 5, Article 3

Gupta et al. 3.5

and the lower density of genes with male-biased expression
on the X chromosome [25]. There are, however, many
genes with ‘housekeeping’ functions on both the X chromosome and the autosomes that are expected to be equally
expressed in both oogenic and spermatogenic germ cells.
To determine how genes with housekeeping function
respond to dose in the germline, we examined in more
detail the expression levels of nuclear genes encoding cytoplasmic or mitochondrial ribosomal subunits [26]. The X
chromosome and autosomal genes show strikingly similar
distributions (p > 0.1 by regression analysis of slopes and
intercepts), despite a twofold difference in X-chromosome
dose (Figure 5b). We also identified a de facto set of housekeeping genes by investigating array elements showing
reduced hybridization variance and high intensity
hybridization across all our experiments (Figure 5c). In the
absence of dosage compensation, we would expect a deficit
of X chromosome genes in this subset, as they would show
increased variance due to the dose difference. We found no
deficit of X-chromosome encoded genes showing lowvariance expression. Both these analyses indicate that at
least some X-chromosome genes are dosage compensated in
the wild-type germline.

Transcriptional response to altered autosomal gene
dose
To understand the precision of X-chromosome dosage compensation, we first need to understand the general response

Figure 2 (see figure on the previous page)
Sex-determination hierarchy. Sex-biased expression was controlled for by using mutations in sex-determination genes. Relevant aspects of
(a) wild-type female, (b) wild-type males, (c) somatic transformation from female to male (sex transformed), (d) somatic transformation from
male to female (sex transformed), and (e) germline transformation are outlined. (a) Sex determination occurs in early embryogenesis, before the
activation of dosage compensation, which leads to higher levels of expression of transcription factors on the X chromosome in XX;AA than
X;AA individuals. These transcription factors activate Sex-lethal (Sxl) in the soma. The Sxl protein regulates the alternative splicing of the
transformer (tra) pre-mRNA such that Tra protein is produced only in females. Sxl also inhibits the formation of the MSL dosage compensation
complex. Tra protein and non-sex-specifically expressed Transformer2 (Tra2) protein control the alternative splicing of the doublesex (dsx) premRNA. The dsx mRNAs resulting from Tra- and Tra2-mediated splicing encode a female-specific DsxF transcription factor. Sex determination in
the germline is poorly understood and controversial, but a female somatic environment and an independent reading of the XX;AA karyotype in
germ cells increases expression of positively acting Ovo transcription factors and their direct target, ovarian tumor (otu). The otu locus is required
for Sxl activity in the germline. Note that Sxl does not regulate the MSLs in the germline. The female sex-determination hierarchy results in
oogenic differentiation. (b) In X;AA flies Sxl protein is not present. This permits the formation of the MSL dosage-compensation complex. The tra
pre-mRNAs are spliced to a non-coding form in the absence of Sxl, and in the absence of Tra protein the dsx pre-mRNA is spliced into a default
form encoding a male-specific DsxM transcription factor. The germ cells develop into sperm. (c) XX;AA flies are transformed from females into
males using null mutations of tra2 and by using a dsx mutation encoding a pre-mRNA that is constitutively spliced into the male-specific form
(dsxswe). Flies bearing dsxswe in trans to a deletion produce DsxM protein and no DsxF protein. Similarly, flies null for tra2 produce only DsxM. To
remove germline expression from the analysis of somatic X-chromosome dosage compensation we took advantage of the fact that XX;AA flies
transformed from females into males usually have no germline. These germline-atrophic (having few to no germ cells) XX;AA females
transformed into males were compared with X;AA male carcasses (everything but the gonads) or with X;AA males with a genetically ablated
germline due to the absence of maternal tud+. (d) X;AA flies are transformed from males into females by expressing female-specific tra cDNA
transgenes. The activation of female rather than male sexual differentiation in the X;AA soma results in vast numbers of non-differentiated germ
cells, presumably due to sexual incompatibility between the soma and germline. The sexual identity of these cells is ambiguous. (e) Mutations in
Sxl (using allelic combinations effecting only in the germline isoforms of Sxl) or otu also result in vast numbers of non-differentiated germ cells.
Positive (arrows) and negative (barred lines) genetic or molecular regulation are indicated. Loss-of-function (red) and gain-of-function (green)
mutations and phenotypes are indicated.

high- or low-intensity hybridization to gonad probes and the opposite pattern when hybridized to samples from carcasses or from flies lacking germ

labeled gonad mRNA samples and comparatively weaker hybridization to non-germline samples. Furthermore, at least some of the differences
between the samples also support the proposed germline sex-determination pathway. For example, as predicted, both ovo and otu are germlinebiased and overexpressed in XX;AA Sxl ovaries relative to X;AA hs-tra ovaries [40,69]. All these data validate the use of XX;AA and X;AA
transformed germlines as matched tissues for the careful analysis of X-chromosome dosage compensation in the germline.

of the biological system to altered gene dose. What should
we expect if there is no X-chromosome dosage compensation? A twofold difference in gene dose is unlikely to always
result in a twofold difference in steady-state transcript levels,
as many genes are regulated by elegant feedback mechanisms that would dampen the effect of gene dose. Similarly,
we need to prove that the entire data-handling pipeline
allows us to see gene-expression differences associated with
altered gene dose.
To determine whether differences in genetic dose result in
detectable differences in gene expression, we have directly
measured gene-expression changes resulting from altered
gene dose due to deficiency (deletion) and duplication of
an autosomal segment of the genome. The duplication that
we used overlaps the deletion region, but covers more
genes.
Flies
heterozygous
for
the
duplication
Dp(2:2)Cam3/+ (Dp/+) have three copies of around 330
genes, while flies heterozygous for the deletion Df(2L)J-H/+
(Df/+) are hemizygous for a subset of around 70 of those
duplicated genes [27]. By directly comparing gene expression in flies bearing these aberrations, we assayed the consequences for gene expression of 1-fold, 1.5-fold, and 3-fold
differences in gene dose along chromosome arm 2L.

We isolated mRNA from two independent preparations of
females, males and ovaries and performed six hybridizations comparing Dp/+ and Df/+ samples directly against
each other on microarrays (Figure 6). The effect of altered
autosomal gene dose is obvious in the moving average
plots of expression ratios against position along the chromosome arm (Figure 6). We observed distinct alterations of
gene-expression ratios between Dp/+ and Df/+ flies within
the cytologically defined aneuploid regions in males,
females and ovaries. Moving from left to right along such a
plot, the ratios are essentially 1.0 (indicating equivalent
expression) in the region that is two-copy in both Dp/+ and
Df/+ flies, until reaching the region that is three-copy in
Dp/+ flies and two-copy in Df/+ flies. At this position there
is a strong break in the moving average towards Dp-biased
expression. A similar break in the moving average occurs at
the transition to the region that is three-copy in Dp/+ flies
and single-copy in Df/+ flies. Altered fold ratios between
Dp/+ flies and Df/+ flies return to baseline as the proximal
breakpoints of the aberrations are crossed.
The differences in gene-expression ratios corresponding to
1-, 1.5- and 3-fold dose changes on chromosome 2L are
highly significant (p << 10-4 by ANOVA followed by Tukey

HSD, Hodges-Lehmann, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests;
see Materials and methods). No other similar large blocks of
genes elsewhere in the genome show significantly greater
expression in Dp/+ flies than in Df/+ flies. There were,
however, smaller two-copy regions that showed expression
ratios mimicking the 1.5- to 3-fold gene dose effect or the
inverse effect. These regions could be due to unrecognized
aberrations or could be secondary transcriptional effects.

expression in the soma (72 comparisons), a 1.5-fold dose
difference on an autosome gave a greater difference in
gene-expression profiles than did a twofold difference in
X-chromosome dose (p << 10-4). The same was found in all of
our global comparisons of XX;AA to X;AA expression in transformed gonads (119 comparisons). These data conclusively
demonstrate that germ cells carry out dosage compensation.

Mechanism of X-chromosome dosage compensation
We also used these 1-, 1.5- and 3-fold dose-change data to
tune our data handling. The on-spot background correction
method gave the greatest discrimination power (see Materials and methods and Additional data file 1, available with
the online version of this article), and was used for all subsequent distribution analyses. This method maximizes our
ability to detect the absence of dosage compensation.
The salient feature of the above analyses is that expression
changes due to altered gene dose changes on autosomes are
readily detectable. This provides us with a metric for the
analysis of the similar X-chromosome gene-expression ratios
when comparing XX;AA with X;AA tissues. We performed 48
hybridizations using 96 biological samples (see Materials and
methods). Matched XX;AA and X;AA tissues were compared
in direct hybridizations and were linked through the loop
design to other XX;AA and X;AA samples hybridized on other
arrays. This allowed for even greater numbers of comparisons. In all of our global comparisons of XX;AA with X;AA

Balancing X-chromosome expression between XX;AA and
X;AA germ cells in Drosophila is likely to require either
hypertranscription of the X in males (as occurs in the soma)
or hypotranscription of the X chromosome in females compared with an autosomal reference. Determining which
mechanism of dosage compensation operates in the
germline requires measuring the absolute expression levels
of the X chromosome genes relative to those of autosomal
genes. Gene expression varies by orders of magnitude, but
in a large representative population of genes on a chromosome arm we expect that those represented by two copies
will have higher transcript abundance than those represented by a single copy.
As a rigorous feasibility test, we examined hybridization
intensities in the Df/+ region of autosome 2L. In whole
adult males, adult females and ovaries, average hybridization intensities were significantly lower in the 70 or so
genes in the single-copy Df segment than in the two-copy

Gene-expression changes due to an altered gene dose on autosomes. (a) Experimental design to measure gene-expression changes for altered
autosomal gene dose. Replicate mRNA samples from flies bearing a duplication, Dp(2;2)Cam3/+, or a deletion, Df(2L)JH/+, on the left arm of
autosomal chromosome 2 (2L) were labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5 and hybridized to FlyGEM arrays. These were performed as dye-swap
experiments to avoid any effect of dye bias. Following data extraction, changes in expression ratios as a result of differences in the dose of individual
genes were determined. There are no differences in underlying gene dose outside the region of the aberrations, and there is a 1.5-fold difference
when a gene is present on the duplication (Dp) or a 3-fold difference when the gene is present on the duplication and deleted in the deficiency (Df).
(b) Average expression ratios from duplicate experiments comparing Dp/+ vs Df/+ adult male flies were plotted as a moving average against gene
position along 2L. Gene-expression ratios for no gene dose difference (black), 1.5-fold (green) and 3-fold (orange) gene doses are indicated. Breaks
in gene-expression ratios occur at the predicted cytological breakpoints of the aberrations. The aberrations are cartooned below the moving average
plot, with the Dp (triangle) and Df (gap) indicated. In addition, the diploid regions of the genome where Dp/+ flies show greater expression than Df/+
flies are indicated (arrow).

segments elsewhere in the genome (Figure 7). X chromosomes are hypertranscribed in the soma relative to autosomes. As expected, transcripts from the single X
chromosome in the soma hybridize to arrays as intensely as
those from the two-copy autosomes. We observed the same

trend in the X;AA germline. Transcripts from the X chromosome of X;AA transformed ovaries show as an high intensity
of hybridization as those from the two-copy autosomes. In
fact, the X chromosome appeared to be slightly overexpressed relative to autosomes in the X;AA transformed

ovaries, in each of seven replicate experiments. Even the
transcripts from the single X chromosome in X;AA testis
showed higher intensity hybridization than the single-copy
genes from any Df+ sample (p << 10-4). These results indicate that X-chromosome dosage compensation in the
Drosophila soma and germline is the result of higher percopy X-chromosome transcript accumulation in X;AA cells.
Interestingly, the X chromosome shows slight, but highly
significant, overexpression in all XX;AA samples. This may
be due to inherent hypertranscription of X-chromosome
genes in both males and females.

Escape from dosage compensation
Although the overall expression of X-chromosome genes
appears to be very tightly dosage compensated, there might
be small regions or scattered genes that escape dosage compensation. To look for blocks of the X chromosome that
fail to undergo dosage compensation in either the soma or
the germline, we plotted a moving average of expression
ratios along the length of the X or the similarly sized autosome arm 2L (Figure 8). In the case of the soma, plots of
(XX;AA)/(X;AA) expression ratios revealed only noise fluctuating around expression ratios of unity. X-chromosome
expression ratios for gonads were slightly skewed towards
XX-biased expression, but we detected no overt region of
the X chromosome expressed like a Df/+ region. These
results indicate that no contiguous blocks of genes on the X
chromosome escape dosage compensation in the soma
or germline.
Scattered genes along the X chromosome that fail to
become dosage compensated in either the soma or the
germline are more difficult to detect because there are X
chromosome and autosomal genes that are differentially
expressed between XX;AA and X;AA tissues even following
sex transformation of those tissues. If some autosomal
genes are expressed at higher levels in XX;AA flies than in
X;AA flies, then some X-chromosome genes are expected to
do the same. To test for isolated genes that have escaped
dosage compensation, we extracted all the genes that were
at least 1.5-fold overexpressed in either XX;AA or X;AA flies,

Volume 5, Article 3

Gupta et al. 3.11

normalized them to gene content per arm, and looked for
departure from a normal distribution (Figure 8). If there are
a significant number of genes on the X chromosome that
escape dosage compensation, then there should be more
expression outliers mapping to the X chromosome relative
to similarly sized autosomal segments. Furthermore, the
outliers from the X chromosome should show XX-biased
expression if they escape dosage compensation. In the sextransformed soma, even though there are X-chromosome
genes that always show higher expression in XX;AA than X;AA
somas, we observed no significant enrichment (Figure 8) of
such genes. About twice as many X-chromosome genes as
expected, however, show higher expression in XX;AA transformed germline (p < 10-3, by the ␹2 test). At face value, we
can calculate that approximately 2% of X-chromosome
genes escape dosage compensation in the germline. In the
soma, sex determination and dosage compensation are
linked pathways, however, and this could conceivably be
true for the germline [7,22]. We cannot rule out the possibility that reduced X-chromosome expression in X;AA,
hs-tra/+ ovaries relative to XX;AA otu or Sxl ovaries is due to
a slight defect in germline dosage compensation concurrent
with a germline sex transformation.

Dosage-compensation mechanisms in C. elegans and
the mouse
Although X-chromosome dosage compensation equilibrates
X-chromosome expression between the sexes, the X;AA individuals are the ones to face an unbalanced karyotype. This
makes the increased X-chromosome expression in the X;AA
male Drosophila a logical mechanism of dosage compensation. In contrast, X-chromosome transcription is reduced
from both X chromosomes in C. elegans hermaphrodites,
and one X chromosome is inactivated in mammalian
females [15,16]. In both cases, this dosage compensation
equilibrates X-chromosome expression between the sexes,
but also makes both sexes functionally aneuploid with
respect to the autosomes. This conundrum is solved if X
chromosomes are generally hypertranscribed and if
X-chromosome inactivation or hypotranscription in XX;AA
females or hermaphrodites is a mechanism to prevent

overexpression of the X chromosome. Otherwise, hypertranscription of the X chromosome in XX;AA individuals would
result in functional tetraploidy.
In order to investigate the activity level of the X chromosome
in these animals, we reanalyzed previously published array
data on gene expression in the soma of hermaphrodite and
male C. elegans [28] and female and male mice [29]. These
studies reported on gene-expression differences between the
sexes rather than dosage compensation. From scatterplots of
these data there is little difference between the expression of
the X chromosome in XX;AA versus X;AA germlineless
animals or somatic tissues (Figure 9). Given that both species
have somatic dosage-compensation mechanisms that equilibrate expression between the sexes, this is unsurprising.
To determine whether per-copy transcription from the X
chromosome is reduced in XX;AA soma, we measured the
average hybridization intensity for the X and all autosomes
in both X;AA and XX;AA animals (Figure 9). Transcripts
from the single X chromosome in X:AA C. elegans male
soma hybridize as well as those of two-copy autosomes.
Indeed, the X chromosomes of both X;AA and XX;AA
C. elegans appear to be overexpressed relative to autosomes
(p << 10-4). Similarly, X-chromosome transcripts from X;AA
and XX;AA mouse soma (average of hypothalamus, kidney
and liver) are detected well within the range of those of the
autosomes. Many mouse tissues have been examined, and
we find evidence of elevated X-chromosome expression in
all cases (data not shown). A study concurrent with this one
has extensively cataloged mammalian X-chromosome
dosage compensation, and confirms our observation that
the single X chromosome in males and the single active X
chromosome in females are compensated [30]. These findings suggest that the single X chromosomes of X;AA
C. elegans and mice are expressed at levels comparable to
two autosomes, as we observed in Drosophila. Perhaps this is
a universal phenomenon.

Discussion
Polytene salivary gland chromosomes have greatly facilitated the analysis of dosage compensation in Drosophila [8],
but global analysis of dosage compensation in the other
tissues has not been conclusive. A recent reverse transcriptase
(RT)-PCR study showed a wide range of states of compensation of X-chromosome genes [31]. Sex-biased expression
potentially distorts such dosage-compensation analysis,
however. There is extensive sex-biased expression in
Drosophila [24,32-34] and, furthermore, these genes are not
equally distributed between the X chromosome and autosomes [25,35]. Studies directed at subsets of genes have
revealed complex relationships between X chromosome and

Volume 5, Article 3

Gupta et al. 3.13

autosome expression. It is, however, difficult to interpret a
subtle difference in X-chromosome expression between
XX;AA and X;AA individuals if effects of a similar magnitude
are seen for autosomal genes [36]. Global analysis of transcription in non-polytene tissues could help resolve the
nature of X-chromosome dosage compensation in the
understudied tissues that make up the bulk of the fly.
Microarray analysis is ideally suited to the study of dosage
compensation. Our results suggest that remarkably tight Xchromosome dosage compensation occurs in a wide range
of adult tissues. Most importantly, we also provide the first
evidence for germline dosage compensation in any organism. The compensation mechanism in both the soma and
germline is the equilibration of X chromosome expression
with autosomal expression. This is likely to be due to
increased expression from the single X chromosome in
X;AA, although decreased expression from all the autosomes
could also ensure that X chromosome expression is equilibrated with the autosomes [37].

MSL-independent germline dosage compensation
Germline X-chromosome dosage compensation has been a
black box for decades [22]. As the well-known somatic
dosage-compensation mechanisms in the major genetic
model organisms clearly do not function in the germline,
the idea has gradually emerged that germ cells are dosagetolerant. This is due not to evidence of absence, but to
absence of evidence. Although our results show that dosage
compensation in the soma and germline are thematically
similar, the mechanisms in the germline must be distinct.
The MSL complexes required for dosage compensation in
the soma are dispensable in the germline [10,12]. This
might appear to be non-parsimonious, but germline and
somatic gene expression also appear to be distinct. The male
and female germline express different types of basal transcription machinery, such as male-germline-specific TATAbox-binding associated factors (TAFs), which might require
a different chromatin structure [38,39], and germlinerestricted factors bind the germline-restricted core promoter
of the ovo gene [40]. In addition, even though somatic
dosage compensation is highly conserved, proteins mediating
dosage compensation are not. For example, in some other
species of flies the MSL complex associates with all chromosomes, not just the X chromosome [41-43], suggesting that
the complex plays no role in dosage compensation in those
organisms. In yeast, which lack well differentiated sex chromosomes, one of the main MSL complex components is
required for viability [44]. These observations indicate that
MSL complexes play markedly different roles in different
species. Given the differences in gene expression between
the germline and the soma, it is perhaps unsurprising that

different proteins might be involved in Drosophila germline
dosage compensation.
It is also unclear whether the MSL complex accounts for all
somatic dosage compensation. For example, XX;AA flies
lacking Sex-lethal (Sxl) protein in the soma die, presumably
because of a failure to repress MSL complex formation [45].
But mutations in the MSL-encoding genes fail to rescue the
lethality of XX;AA flies without Sxl, suggesting that Sxl
represses additional dosage-compensation functions [46].
Similarly, in polytene salivary glands, large blocks of the X
chromosome do not associate with MSL complexes [47]. We
find no evidence to support extensive escape from X-chromosome dosage compensation in somatic tissues. These
results are consistent with either selective deployment of
MSLs at active genes [47] or MSL-independent dosage compensation at a subset of genes.
Mutations in genes regulating germline dosage compensation would be expected to show karyotype-specific phenotypes. Interestingly, there are at least two genes that appear to
be required for the viability of XX;AA but not X;AA germ
cells; ovo and stand still (stil) [48,49]. Negative and positive
Ovo protein isoforms act at the transcription start site of at
least some promoters [5,40,50] and Stil protein decorates
active chromatin when overexpressed in the soma [49].
Perhaps one or both of these proteins serve to block the
upregulation of the X chromosome that normally occurs in
the male germline. This could be analogous to the situation
in the Drosophila soma, where dosage compensation is
actively repressed in XX;AA females [7]. There are also a
number of genes that are required for the viability of male
germ cells [51]. Some of these genes may encode dosagecompensation functions. If such dosage-compensation genes
exist, they might encode chromatin-modifying complexes, as
in the Drosophila soma. Given that our data show that steadystate transcripts from the X chromosome are compensated,
however, there are a host of post-transcriptional mechanisms, such as preferential mRNA stability, that could conceivably mediate germline dosage compensation.
X-chromosome dosage-compensation mechanisms might
arise from dosage control mechanisms that are active at

many or all genes. Indeed, we have detected transcriptional
buffering in our control experiments on the effects of autosome gene dose. We found that the magnitude of the transcriptional effect was less than expected from a simple
calculation of gene dose. This inverse effect on transcription
relative to gene dose has been known for decades [52-54],
and has recently been observed in expression profiling and
RT-PCR studies [31,55-57]. It seems likely that many genes
have a self-contained dosage-compensation system, albeit an
imperfect one. The MSL components have general transcriptional activity in yeast and appear to have been co-opted in
Drosophila to regulate somatic dosage compensation.
Germline dosage compensation might be mediated by other
co-opted cis- or trans-acting components that serve to buffer
gene expression.

Escape from dosage compensation
There are X-chromosome genes, such as LSP1-␣, that escape
dosage compensation in Drosophila [58], but it is not
known how common this might be. Similarly, in
mammals, many X-chromosome genes escape inactivation
in females (escape from dosage compensation in X;AA
males has not been examined). In theory, this is expected,
as not all genes need to be dosage compensated in the
course of X-chromosome evolution [59]. Although we can
confidently analyze populations of X-chromosome genes,
it is quite difficult to determine whether a given gene
escapes dosage compensation. Indeed, in the absence of a
detailed, gene-by-gene mechanistic study, it might be impossible. There are many autosomal genes that are more highly
expressed in XX;AA than X;AA tissues, even after controlling
for sex-biased expression. These gene-expression differences
are clearly not directly related to X-chromosome dosage
compensation. Many of the X-chromosome genes expressed
at higher levels in XX;AA than X;AA tissues will be similarly
unrelated to dosage compensation per se. In studies of escape
from dosage compensation in Drosophila, C. elegans, or
mammals where sex-bias is uncontrolled, reports of genes
escaping dosage compensation could well be spurious.
On a global level, we find no evidence for escape from
dosage compensation in the Drosophila soma. In the
germline, however, there are clearly more genes with

XX-biased expression than expected. There are several different interpretations of this finding. It is possible that escape
from dosage compensation is more common in the
germline (about 2% of genes). Alternatively, there may be
slight under-compensation in the germline. The X chromosomes in both XX;AA and X;AA gonads appear to be overexpressed relative to autosomes, however. It is therefore
possible that the slight excess of XX-biased expression is due
to failure to fully dampen X-chromosome hypertranscription in XX;AA females.

Towards a unified model of dosage compensation
Females have two X chromosomes and males have one. It is
therefore natural to think of the problem of dosage compensation as a mechanism to equilibrate X chromosome expression between the sexes. But changing the dose of large
segments of the genome is a problem for the individual with
the aneuploid condition - the males in the case of the major
metazoan model systems. Remarkably, an X chromosome is
inactivated in female mammals. Equally remarkable, both X
chromosomes in C. elegans hermaphrodites are downregulated. Why should X chromosome dosage compensation be
achieved in these organisms by unbalancing gene expression
in both sexes? Our analyses of pre-existing array data suggest
that both the male X chromosome and the single active
female X chromosome are hypertranscribed or accumulated
in mammals. In the course of our study, some of the same
data has been reanalyzed independently, and the authors of
the other study have reached similar conclusions [30]. These
data support a more unified theory of dosage compensation
[17-20], whereby X-chromosome expression is increased in
all X;AA cells (Figure 10). There may be counteracting forces
to increase X-chromosome expression in X;AA males and to
keep X-chromosome expression under control in XX;AA
females. Indeed, our analysis suggests that in Drosophila and
C. elegans, the X chromosomes of XX;AA and X;AA tissues
are overexpressed relative to autosomes. Such overshooting
would be expected to be more detrimental to XX;AA
individuals and could have given rise to X-chromosome
inactivation in the mammalian lineage. Interestingly, the
repressive chromatin-associated protein HP1 is enriched on
the Drosophila X chromosome in males [60]. Perhaps this is
to modulate overcompensation.

Conclusions
Dosage compensation has been under study for a nearly a
century. Examination of chromatin structure, rather than
direct assay of gene transcription, dominates the recent
dosage-compensation literature. Microarray analysis allows us
direct access to the transcript accumulation of all X-chromosome genes. The Drosophila array data provide the first demonstration in any organism that germ cells dosage compensate.

Model for X-chromosome dosage compensation in Drosophila, C. elegans
and mouse. X-chromosome transcription is generally upregulated (green
arrow). X;AA tissues thus avoid unbalanced expression of
X-chromosome genes. In order to avoid overexpression of
X-chromosome genes (red symbols), females either destroy the
compensation machinery used in males (Drosophila soma), or deploy a
counteracting mechanism to reduce expression from both hyperactive X
chromosomes (C. elegans) or eliminate expression from one hyperactive
X chromosome (mouse). The mechanism used in the XX;AA Drosophila
germline is unknown, but given that X-chromosome expression in the
female germline is bi-allelic, an X-inactivation mechanism is unlikely.

These data also add a significant twist to our understanding of
dosage compensation in mammals and C. elegans. Microarray
analysis will be a vital tool for directly assaying this intriguing
whole-chromosome regulation of gene expression.

Materials and methods
Drosophila strains
Flies were grown at 25°C, aged for 5-6 days, dissected, flashfrozen, and prepared for RNA extraction as described previously [24] (see the Flybase compendium of information on
genes, alleles, and phenotypes for additional descriptions
[27]). Flies used to test for the effect of chromosomal aberrations were Dp(2;2)Cam3/+ and Df(2L)J-H/+ that were
generated from outcrossing the stocks to y1 w67c to remove
the balancer chromosomes. In addition to using XX;AA
females (y1 w67c), we transformed XX;AA flies into males
using null mutations of transformer2 (tra2B/Df(2R)trix) and
by using a dsx mutation encoding a pre-mRNA that is constitutively spliced into the male-specific form (dsxswe). Flies
bearing dsxswe trans to a deletion produce DsxM protein and
no DsxF protein (dsxswe/Df(3R)dsxM+15). Similarly, flies null
for tra2 produce only DsxM. To obtain X;AA flies that are sex
transformed from males into females, we crossed female
flies bearing female-specific tra cDNA transgenes (w; P{w+
hs-tra83}/CyO or Gla) or (Df(3L)stj7 Ki roe pp P{hs-tra}/TM3
or TM6) to BsY males. The hs-tra transgenes are sufficiently

active at 25°C to transform males into phenotypic females.
We did not utilize a heat-shock regimen.
In order to study the expression changes resulting from a
twofold change in the dose of the X chromosome between
the XX;AA and X;AA germlines, we utilized genetic mutations that we show remove most sex-biased germline
expression from the analysis. The activation of female rather
than male sexual differentiation in the soma with hs-tra in
X;AA flies results in gonads with vast numbers of poorly differentiated germ cells. Mutations in Sxl (y Sxlfs3/y cm Sxl7BO)
or otu (ct otu1 v24/y w otu17) result in a similar germline phenotype. Occasionally, a few ovaries from X;AA hs-tra flies
and germline-transformed Sxl or otu flies bear eggs. These
ovaries were not included in the samples. Similarly, very
small ovaries that are essentially germlineless were not
included in any of our samples.
To remove germline expression from the analysis of somatic
X-chromosome dosage compensation, we took advantage of
the fact that XX;AA flies transformed from females to males
usually have no germline, but rarely have a few germ cells
showing either oogenic or spermatogenic phenotypes. These
germline-atrophic XX;AA females transformed into males
were compared with both gonadectomized X;AA males or
sham-dissected X;AA males with a genetically ablated
germline as a result of the absence of maternal Tud+
(progeny of tud1 bw1 sp1 mothers).

Arrays
We have used an extensively tested microarray platform
designed to detect transcription from 94% of
D. melanogaster release 1 genes [61]. Unlike most array
studies, where the object is to determine which genes are
altered between tissues, life stages or treatments, we focus
here on non-differential expression. In dozens of homotypic hybridization experiments (where an mRNA sample is
split, labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5, mixed, and hybridized
to the array) performed as part of this (data not shown) and
previous studies, we find that the expression ratio is 1 and
that there are very few outliers [24,25,61]. In the most
extensive set of such homotypic hybridizations, the 99.5%
confidence intervals were always between 1.4 and 1.5-fold
[61]. Given that only a handful of genes are expected to
show artifactually a greater than 1.5-fold expression difference, we easily had the sensitivity to detect changes in
expression owing to a twofold difference in the 2,245 Xchromosome genes represented on the array.
We have further shown that twofold differences in mRNA
concentrations can be readily detected by adding known concentrations of mRNA to hybridization mixes in ‘spike-in’
experiments [61]. Analysis of spike-in control data (a twofold

Gupta et al. 3.17

change in input results in a twofold difference in expression
ratios) and a comparison of sex-biased expression determined by FlyGEM and northern blotting reveal no evidence
of compression of expression ratios in our data [24,61].

Sample preparation and labeling
We used 96 biological samples in this study. Careful sample
preparation ensures minimum adjustment in subsequent
data handling. Dissections, flash freezing and RNA extractions were performed as described [24,61]. Briefly, total
RNA was extracted using Trizol (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA), followed by mRNA isolation using an Oligotex
poly(A) extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, USA). RNA concentration was determined using RiboGreen dye (Molecular
Probes, Oak Ridge, USA) in a fluorescent assay using a
Luminescence Spectrometer LS-50B (PerkinElmer, Fremont,
USA) fitted with 485 nm (excitation) and 520 nm (emission) filters. RNA quality was determined by capillary electrophoresis on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Palo Alto,
USA), using the 6000 Nano Assay kit (Agilent) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
Samples were labeled with Cy3- or Cy5-labeled random
nonamers (Trilink Biosciences, San Diego, USA). To ensure
that each of the nonamer sets was in fact equally ‘random’,
we ordered a single batch of random oligonucleotides that
was split into half at the penultimate synthetic step with Cy3
or Cy5 nucleotides added at the end. To verify performance
of these oligonucleotides, we performed an experiment in
which RNA was labeled using both Cy3 and Cy5 nonamers
in the same tube, followed by hybridization, scanning and
analysis. There was no dye bias evident. Hybridizations of
samples to the microarrays were performed at 60°C, followed by washes exactly as described [24,61].

Scanning
Arrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 3000A fluorescence reader (Molecular Devices Corporation, Union City,
USA) in which the photon multiplier tube (PMT) settings
were first adjusted using calibration slides. GenePix v.4.1
image acquisition software (Molecular Devices Corporation)
was used to extract signal for each target element. Calibration slides were Ultra GAPS (Corning, Acton, USA) spotted
with 10-3 to 10-6 dilutions of a 0.33 nM each stock of Cy3
and Cy5 dyes (Amersham Biosciences, Pittsburgh, USA)
using GMS 417 Arrayer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, USA). The
PMT voltages, in the linear range, were balanced using these
slides. With each new batch of labeling and hybridization,
we included a homotypic hybridization [61], in which the
same RNA preparation from y1 w67c whole males was split
into two tubes, labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 nonamers, mixed
and hybridized. Slight adjustments of PMT voltages were
sometimes made on these control slides. No elements were

Gupta et al.

saturated. Once PMT settings were determined, all arrays in
the same hybridization batch were scanned at the same
voltage settings. Hybridization and labeling quality was
determined by confirming that the channels were close to
global balance in the absence of PMT adjustment (no ‘onthe-fly’ adjustments were made). No arrays were discarded
because of failed labeling reactions in one of the two channels. In addition, all elements were printed in duplicate.
Regression analysis of plots of duplicate elements was also
used as a quality-control step for gradients and severe speckling. No arrays were discarded following duplicate element
evaluation. Finally, we determined the fraction of elements
that returned signal above on-spot background (see Data
handling). Three arrays were discarded from the study
because less than 50% of elements exhibited above-background signal.

Loop design for microarray pairings
Samples from all flies and tissues were prepared (Table 1)
and hybridized using a loop design [62]. This design (see
Additional data file 2) ensured first, that the highest-quality
direct hybridizations were predominantly between matched
XX;AA and X;AA tissues and second, that any sample could
be compared with every other sample included in the study,
after normalization across all samples. Most of the relevant
samples were compared directly, but all samples are connected in the design for indirect comparisons. In most direct
comparisons we have included both technical labeling replicates (dye-flips) and biological replicates. Although we used
a series of pair-wise comparisons of XX;AA and X;AA samples
in this study, the flexible design will allow easy future use to
address other questions about sex-biased expression.

Data handling
Drosophila data were processed using the Bioconductor [63]
package limma (Linear Models for Microarray Analysis) v.
1.7.6, to adjust for effects that arise from variations in
microarray technology rather than biological differences.
Because of the care taken in using identical RNA concentrations in labeling reactions and scanner settings, data handling
resulted in minimal adjustments to the raw data. We did not
average duplicate array elements as this would reduce statistical power in later steps. At the individual array level, the
raw intensity data were normalized using print-tip loess
(locally weighted scatter plot smooth) [64]. This corrects for
tip biases and for minor hybridization gradients. This was
followed by one of three different background corrections.
For background elimination, intensities less than the average
intensities of the barcode elements (designed against DNA
corresponding to an intron that were included in printing
plates for tracking purposes, but are also quite useful for
background correction [61]) were classified as background
and excluded from calculations. For on-spot background

http://jbiol.com/content/5/1/3

correction, the average intensity of the barcoding elements in
the array were subtracted from the spot intensity for every
array element. For the no-correction option, we used quantile normalization to compare across arrays [64]. Experiments with the Df/+ and Dp/+ flies confirm that on-spot
background correction maximizes expression differences
within aneuploid segments, but the effect of the copy
number was evident with both background elimination and
no background correction (see Additional data file 1).
Array data from C. elegans and mouse were extracted directly
from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) website [65]. We
performed no additional normalization or background correction. The C. elegans experiments were two-channel hybridizations on spotted arrays [28]. Test samples were hybridized
with a reference sample. The reference channels cancel in our
comparison of XX;AA versus X;AA gene expression. The mouse
experiments were performed on Affymetrix arrays [29].

Data sources
All array data are available at GEO. An extensive platform
description of FlyGEM is available at GEO under accession
number GPL20 [61]. Data are available under GEO accessions
GSM37438-GSM37451,
GSM2464-2467,
GSM16582GSM16583, GSM16570-GSM16581, and GSM77749GSM77752. Expression data from mouse hypothalamus,
kidney and liver were obtained from GEO accession
number GSE1148 [29]. C. elegans data were from GEO
accession number GSE715 and GSE724 [28].

Exploratory data visualization
Data were clustered and visualized using Cluster 3.0/TreeView 1.6 [66]. A self-organizing map (SOM) was calculated
to organize normalized hybridization intensities (on-spot
background subtraction followed by quantile normalization
across arrays) of array elements at 100,000 iterations,
followed by k-means clustering of genes with 10 nodes
using the correlation (uncentered) similarity metric. Genes,
but not experiments, were clustered. We averaged duplicate
elements for this analysis to avoid crashing the application.
For scatterplots and moving average plots, we used data
processed by background elimination followed by quantile
normalization across all experiments. We used on-spot
background corrected data for histograms of Drosophila
expression data. Chi-squared tests were performed in Excel
(Microsoft, Redmond, USA).
Array elements encoding Drosophila ribosomal subunits were
identified using the Gene Ontology identifier ‘structural constituent of ribosomes’ as assigned in GEO accession GPL20.
The de facto housekeeping elements were identified as
follows. Following background elimination and quantile

normalization across all experiments, we selected the elements with hybridization intensities greater than two standard deviations above the median intensity of all array
elements, from all experiments. From the above, we
selected the de facto housekeeping elements as those elements with standard deviations for the expression ratios as
± 0.1. Regressions for the X-encoded and the autosomeencoded elements were calculated separately in Bioconductor. Slopes and intercepts were compared at the 95%
confidence limit.
Moving averages of expression ratios for every 40 consecutive
elements (two elements per predicted transcript) were

plotted against the corresponding gene positions on chromosome arm 2L or X. The predicted cytological break points
[27] were used to define the boundaries of aneuploid segments on chromosome arm 2L, in the Dp/+ vs Df/+ experiments. Moving averages were calculated in Bioconductor.

Analysis of distributions
The distribution statistics cited in the text were obtained using
data processed with print-tip loess and on-spot background
correction on individual arrays, and quantile normalization
between arrays. We can unequivocally show that a modest
1.5-fold difference in gene dose has a detectable effect on gene
expression using precisely the same data-handling methods

Journal of Biology 2006, 5:3

Gupta et al.

that we apply to the study of the X. In addition, the data-handling method used is the least favorable method vis-a-vis the
conclusions we report. Differences in gene expression in autosomal aneuploid segments were always significantly greater
than those observed between the X chromosomes from XX;AA
and X;AA samples.
We performed a one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey HSD method for protection in multiple
comparisons using Matlab (The MathWorks, Natick, USA).
All cells were filled ten times. One-way ANOVA was used to
compare three different sets of expression ratios or hybridization intensities. The single blocking factor for one-way
ANOVA was gene dose. We used bootstrap sampling of
pooled array data to fill each of the three ANOVA cells of the
one-way design. For ratiometric data, those cells were
(Dp/+)/(+/+), AA/AA, and XX/X (see Additional data file 3,
Tables 1-3). To fill the (Dp/+)/(+/+) cell, we pooled expression ratios associated with a 1.5-fold difference in gene dose
from the replicate samples from whole males, whole females
and ovaries, and sampled 600 ratios. There are fewer genes in
the Dp region than on all autosomes or on the X chromosome. Therefore, the stability of this inference was verified by
filling this cell with 200 ratios from each of the tissue types
separately (data not shown). To fill the AA/AA cell we pooled
all array data reported in this article where the gene dose was
1 and sampled 600 ratios. To fill the XX/X cells we sampled
600 X-chromosome ratios for each of three different gonad
comparisons separately. Those are (otu1/otu17)/(hs-tra/+),
(Sxlfs3/Sxl7BO)/(hs-tra/+) and ovary/testis (see Additional data
file 3, Tables 1-3). For analysis of Drosophila intensity data,
the cells were Df/+, AA, and X (see Additional data file 3,
Tables 4,5). As with ratiometric data, intensity data were
bootstrap sampled 600 times and the procedure was repeated
ten times. Stability for the Df/+ cell was also verified. The
inferences were similar in all ten samplings of 200 intensity
values from each tissue type (data not shown). For C. elegans
and mouse data the cells were AA and X (see Additional data
file 3, Table 6). These cells were filled as for Drosophila. For
mouse, we ran ANOVA on pooled intensities from liver,
kidney and hypothalamus. We also analyzed each tissue separately. The Tukey HSD procedure was performed in Matlab
and generated a confidence interval for each pair of comparisons that has a family-wise error rate of, at most, ␣ = 0.05
(see Additional data file 3).
For the Drosophila data, we applied a bootstrapped HodgesLehmann (HL) estimate of median differences to determine if
X-chromosome expression was more similar to autosomal
expression or to expression from autosomal aberrations (see
Additional data files 4,5). Additional data file 6 shows a
cartoon depicting bootstrap HL estimates of median differences followed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. HL

http://jbiol.com/content/5/1/3

estimates and KS tests were performed in Bioconductor. For
ratiometric data (see Additional data file 4), the HL estimate
was calculated for every drawing of 600 bootstrap samples
from the (Dp/+)/(+/+) and AA/AA distributions to generate a
new distribution of differences. Next, the same bootstrap sampling was used for the XX/X and AA/AA distribution to generate a second distribution of differences. Intensity data were
treated similarly (see Additional data file 5). The two distributions of differences were then compared using the KS test. The
differences in the medians and associated D and p-values for
the KS tests then permitted inference concerning the proximity
of expression ratios or intensities. In practical terms, a significant p-value allows us to accept (not reject) the assumption
that expression ratios AA/AA are closer to XX/X than to Dp/+.
This procedure of bootstrap sampling, HL estimation and KS
evaluation was repeated ten times to check the stability and
robustness of the inferences. In all cases, replicate evaluations
resulted in the same inference.
