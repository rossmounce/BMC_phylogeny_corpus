Abstract
Background: Osmosensing and associated signal transduction pathways have not yet been described in obligately
halophilic bacteria. Chromohalobacter salexigens is a halophilic bacterium with a broad range of salt tolerance. In
response to osmotic stress, it synthesizes and accumulates large amounts of the compatible solutes ectoine and
hydroxyectoine. In a previous work, we showed that ectoines can be also accumulated upon transport from the
external medium, and that they can be used as carbon sources at optimal, but not at low salinity. This was related
to an insufficient ectoine(s) transport under these conditions.
Results: A C. salexigens Tn1732-induced mutant (CHR95) showed a delayed growth with glucose at low and
optimal salinities, could not grow at high salinity, and was able to use ectoines as carbon sources at low salinity.
CHR95 was affected in the transport and/or metabolism of glucose, and showed a deregulated ectoine uptake at
any salinity, but it was not affected in ectoine metabolism. Transposon insertion in CHR95 caused deletion of three
genes, Csal0865-Csal0867: acs, encoding an acetyl-CoA synthase, mntR, encoding a transcriptional regulator of the
DtxR/MntR family, and eupR, encoding a putative two-component response regulator with a LuxR_C-like DNAbinding helix-turn-helix domain. A single mntR mutant was sensitive to manganese, suggesting that mntR encodes
a manganese-dependent transcriptional regulator. Deletion of eupR led to salt-sensitivity and enabled the mutant
strain to use ectoines as carbon source at low salinity. Domain analysis included EupR as a member of the NarL/
FixJ family of two component response regulators. Finally, the protein encoded by Csal869, located three genes
downstream of eupR was suggested to be the cognate histidine kinase of EupR. This protein was predicted to be a
hybrid histidine kinase with one transmembrane and one cytoplasmic sensor domain.
Conclusions: This work represents the first example of the involvement of a two-component response regulator in
the osmoadaptation of a true halophilic bacterium. Our results pave the way to the elucidation of the signal
transduction pathway involved in the control of ectoine transport in C. salexigens.

Background
Due to the frequent osmolarity changes in their habitat,
microorganisms have developed a number of osmoadaptation mechanisms to adapt to these fluctuations [1,2]. In
most bacteria, the long-term response to hyperosmotic

conditions involves the intracellular accumulation of
large quantities of small, specific organic osmolytes called
compatible solutes since they do not interfere with the
normal functioning of the cell [3]. It has been demonstrated that compatible solutes have the ability to protect
enzymes and whole cells against different stresses such as
those caused by salt, heating, freezing and desiccation
[3,4]. Thus, they are considered as biostabilizers. It is
commonly accepted that uptake of exogenous compatible solutes (osmoprotectants) is preferred over their

synthesis de novo, as it is energetically less costly [5]. On
the other hand, hypoosmotic stress leads to opening of
mechanosensitive channels, which function as emergence
valves leading to rapid efflux of compatible solutes
thereby lowering the osmotic driving force for water
entry [6]. Besides their role as stress protectants, some
compatible solutes can be used as carbon, energy or
nitrogen sources. This duality of functions (stress protection and nutrition) requires complex regulatory circuits
(most of them not yet elucidated) to adjust the rate of
compatible solute biosynthesis, transport and catabolism
[4,7,8].
A number of genes and enzymes responsible for
synthesis, uptake and efflux of compatible solutes have
been identified in diverse bacteria [1,6-10]. However, the
mechanisms by which bacteria sense osmotic shifts
(osmosensing) and the signal transduction pathways
leading to these genes (osmosignaling) have focused on
membrane-based osmosensors from moderately halotolerant, but not halophilic, bacteria. These include osmosensory transporters, histidine kinases of two-component
transcriptional regulatory systems [9], and mechanosensitive channels of the MscL, MscS and MscK type [6].
Whereas the first and the third group can detect osmotic
pressure changes and respond by mediating compatible
solute uptake or efflux, respectively, without the assistance
of other proteins, membrane-bound histidine kinases
detect changes in osmotic pressure and other signals and
then respond by directing cognate response regulators to
modulate transcription of osmoregulated genes. The best
studied osmosensory transporters mediate uptake of
potassium, i.e. Trk from Escherichia coli, and betaine, such
as ProP from E. coli, OpuA from Lactococcus lactis and
BetP from Corynebacterium glutamicum [9,11]. On the
other hand, the best characterized two-component
transcriptional regulatory systems involved in bacterial
osmoadaptation are KdpDE and EnvZ/OmpR from E. coli,
and MtrAB from C. glutamicum [11-13].
Both sensory histidine protein kinases and response
regulators of two-component signal transduction systems are multi-domain proteins. Histidine protein
kinases typically consist of a variable N-terminal sensory
or “input” domain, which detects environmental stimuli
and activates a conserved C-terminal cytoplasmic transmitter domain, comprising an ATP-binding kinase
domain and a histidine-containing dimerization domain.
On the other hand, most response regulators contain a
conserved N-terminal receiver (REC) domain and a variable C-terminal effector or “output” domain. The first
one catalyzes the transfer of the phosphoryl group from
the cognate histidine protein kinase to one of its own
aspartic residues. As a result, the receiver domain
undergoes a conformational change capable of promoting activity of the effector domain [14,16].

Two general approaches have been used for classifying
bacterial two-component systems. The first one is based
on the diversity of input (i.e. cellular location, membrane topology, arrangement of sensory domains) or
output (i.e., DNA-binding, RNA-binding, proteinbinding, enzymatic, etc) domain architecture and
domain combinations [14,15,17]. The second one is
based on the phylogeny of transmitter and receiver
domains [18]. Interestingly, the results of both classifications agree to a certain extent, as it seems that the
majority of signal transduction proteins belong to a relatively small number of major families, which share common ancestry, and gene/domain architecture.
Osmosensing and associated signal transduction pathways have not yet been described in obligate halophilic
bacteria. Chromohalobacter salexigens [19] is a halophilic gamma proteobacterium that grows optimally at 1.5
M NaCl in minimal medium [20]. It requires at least 0.5
M NaCl for any growth at all, and can tolerate up to 3
M NaCl, being considered as a model microorganism to
study prokaryotic osmoadaptation [8]. Interestingly, C.
salexigens lowest salinity for growth is the highest NaCl
concentration that the non halophilic E. coli, traditionally used for osmoregulation studies, can tolerate. C.
salexigens finely adjusts its cytoplasmic compatible
solute pool in order to cope with high salinity and
supra-optimal temperatures [21,22]. This is achieved by
a highly hierarchical accumulation of solutes, dominated
by the uptake of external osmoprotectants such as
betaine or its precursor choline [23,24], and followed by
the synthesis of endogenous solutes, mainly ectoines
(ectoine and hydroxyectoine), and minor amounts of
glutamate, glutamine, trehalose and glucosylglycerate
[8]. Ectoine and hydroxyectoine are essential for osmoprotection and thermoprotection, respectively [22].
C. salexigens can also accumulate ectoines after transport from the external medium, and the ectoine transport rate is maximal at optimal salinity [25]. Within the
sequence of the C. salexigens genome, we have found
orthologs to the TRAP-T-type TeaABC transport system
for ectoines of the closely related Halomonas elongata
[10]. We have experimental evidence that this system is
the main responsible for the uptake of ectoines in
C. salexigens (J. Rodriguez-Moya, unpublished data). On
the other hand, although glucose is the preferred carbon
and energy source, C. salexigens can use a wide range of
substrates as nutrients, including the compatible solutes
betaine, ectoine and hydroxyectoine [25]. Remarkably,
neither ectoines nor betaine could support C. salexigens
growth at low salinity, most probably due to an insufficient uptake of these compatible solutes [25].
Osmoadaptive response through ectoine(s) synthesis in
C. salexigens seems to be finely controlled at the transcriptional level, and several general (s S, s32 , Fur) or

Rodríguez-Moya et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:256

specific regulators have been described [8,24]. However,
the associated sensors remain to be elucidated. In addition, information on osmosensing and signal transduction pathways leading to osmoprotectant uptake in
C. salexigens is missing. In this work, we isolated a C.
salexigens salt-sensitive mutant, strain CHR95, which
was nevertheless able to use ectoines as a sole carbon
source at low salinities due to a deregulated transport.
This mutant was affected in three genes, two of which
were transcriptional regulators. Analyses of single
mutants affected in these regulators suggested the protein EupR as the response regulator of a two-component
system involved in the regulation of ectoine(s) uptake.
In addition, we predicted and analyzed its putative sensor histidine kinase. This work establishes the first analysis of the involvement of the response regulator of a
two-component system in the osmoadaptive response of
halophilic bacteria.

Results
C. salexigens mutant CHR95 can use ectoines as the sole
carbon sources at low salinity

C. salexigens is able to grow in M63 minimal medium
with 0.5 to 3 M NaCl. In a search for C. salexigens saltsensitive mutants, strain CHR95 was isolated after
Tn1732 transponson mutagenesis, as being able to grow
at 0.5 M but not at 2.7 M NaCl on M63 plates (see
Methods). To further characterize its salinity range,
C. salexigens wild type and CHR95 strains were grown
in M63 minimal medium with 20 mM glucose as the
sole carbon source, at salinities ranging from 0.6 to 2.5
M NaCl. As shown in Figure 1, at 0.6 M NaCl the
growth curve of strain CHR95 showed a 20 h lag phase,
followed by a sharp exponential phase to reach the same
OD600 as the wild type strain after ca. 30 h of growth
(see Table 1 for growth rates). At 0.75 M and 1.5 M
NaCl, growth of the mutant followed a similar pattern,

Figure 1 C. salexigens CHR95 can use ectoine as the sole carbon source at low salinity. Wild type (solid symbols) and CHR95 (open
symbols) strains were grown at 37°C in M63 minimal medium with 20 mM glucose, 20 mM ectoine, or 20 mM hydroxyectoine and 0.6 (A), 0.75
(B), 1.5 (C) and 2.5 (D) M NaCl. Values shown are the mean of two replicas of each conditions in three independent experiment ± SD (standard
deviation).

i.e., an extended lag phase, followed by a less pronounced exponential phase than that of the wild type
strain, to eventually reach the wild type growth curve at
the stationary phase of growth. At 2.5 M NaCl the strain
CHR95 showed a salt-sensitive phenotype, as its growth
curve did not reach an OD600 above 0.6 units (Figure 1
and Table 1).
We also compared the ability of the C. salexigens wild
type strain and mutant CHR95 to use ectoine and
hydroxyectoine as the sole carbon sources at different
salinities. As shown in Figure 1 and Table 1, in all
growth experiments ectoine was better carbon source
than hydroxyectoine. Ectoine and hydroxyectoine did
not support the growth of the wild type strain at low
salinity (0.6 M NaCl), and growth was severely impaired
at 0.75 M NaCl). They were used as carbon sources at
optimal (1.5 M NaCl) and high (2.5 M NaCl) salinity (in

this latter case, only ectoine and after a prolonged lag
phase). Remarkably, mutant CHR95 was able to use
ectoine and hydroxyectoine as the sole carbon and
energy source at low salinities (0.6-0.75 M NaCl),
although growth with hydroxyectoine was initiated after
a long lag phase (Figure 1 and Table 1). Other compatible solutes like glycine betaine were not metabolized
under low salinity conditions (not shown). At 1.5 M
NaCl with ectoine or hydroxyectoine, growth of the
mutant was delayed, if compared to the wild type strain,
whereas at 2.5 M NaCl ectoine or hydroxyectoine did
weakly support or not, respectively, CHR95 growth (Figure 1 and Table 1).
Given that strain CHR95 showed a delayed growth
with glucose at any salinity tested, we used natural
abundance 13 C-NMR to determine the total pool of
compatible solutes accumulated by cells grown in M63
with 2.5 M NaCl. The 13 C-NMR spectrum of the
mutant contained four sets of resonances that were
assigned to ectoine, hydroxyectoine, glutamate and glutamine (not shown). This observation suggested that
CHR95 was not affected in the genes encoding the
synthesis of compatible solutes.
Mutant CHR95 is affected in the transport and
metabolism of glucose

Since, if compared to the wild type strain, strain CHR95
showed delayed growth with glucose at low and optimal
salinity, we analyzed the metabolism of glucose in both
strains. For this purpose, cells were cultivated in M63
with 1.5 M NaCl, and the fate of radioactive glucose
was determined at different time intervals as described
in Methods (Figure 2). First, the total radioactivity
remaining in supernatant (S) was determined and considered as an indirect measure of glucose transport. As
evidenced by the sharp decrease in the radioactivity
remaining in the supernatant, the wild type strain incorporated about 95% of the glucose from 20 (early exponential phase) to 38 hours of incubation. In contrast,
glucose uptake by the mutant was slower, with 10-fold
higher radioactivity levels in its supernatant than those
of the wild type after 38 hours of incubation (Figure
2a). Second, we determined, for the wild type and
CHR95 strains, the radioactivity present in the ethanol
insoluble fraction (EIF), containing cell envelopes and
intracellular macromolecules (lipids, proteins), and the
ethanol soluble fraction (ESF), containing small cytoplasmic organic solutes (including ectoines, amino acids,
and others). From the same time interval comprised
between 20 and 38 hours of incubation, the radioactivity
present in the EIF and the ESF of strain CHR95 was 1.5
to 1.8-fold lower (Figure 2b), and 1.3-fold lower (Figure
2c), respectively, than those of the wild type strain.
These results, taken together, suggest that the slow

Figure 2 C. salexigens CHR95 is affected in the transport and metabolism of glucose. Cells grown in M63 with 1.5 M NaCl up to
exponential phase were centrifuged, resuspended in the same medium to an OD600 of c. 0.6, supplemented with 100 μM of [14C]-glucose.
After different times of incubation at 37°C, the glucose remaining in the supernatant (S) and cytoplasmatic solutes synthesized from ectoine,
present in the ethanol insoluble (EIF) and soluble (ESF) fractions, respectively, were determined as described in Methods. The data are the
averages of three different replicates ± SD (standard deviation).

growth of strain CHR95 with glucose might be due, at
least in part, to a decreased glucose transport and
metabolism.
Mutant CHR95 possesses a deregulated ectoine uptake

As mutant CHR95, but not the wild type strain, could
use ectoines as nutrients at low salinities, we investigated the transport and metabolism of ectoine in
both strains in response to increasing osmolarity. As

Figure 3 C. salexigens CHR95 shows a deregulated ectoine
uptake. The wild-type strain and the mutant CHR95
(ΔacseupRmntR::Tn1732) were grown in glucose M63 minimal
medium containing the indicated concentration of NaCl. The
measurement of 40 [14C]-ectoine uptake rates (vi, expressed as nmol
min-1 OD-1 units) was performed as described in Methods.
Experiments were repeated twice, and the data correspond to
mean values.

previously reported by Vargas et al [25], the wild type
strain showed its maximal ectoine transport rate at the
optimal salinity for growth (1.5 M NaCl), which was
3- and 1.5-fold higher than those observed at 0.75 and
2.5 M NaCl, respectively (Figure 3). Notably, the ectoine
transport rates of strain CHR95 were 8-, 2.3-, and
2.5-fold higher at 0.75, 1.5, and 2.5 M NaCl, respectively, than those of the wild type grown at the same
salt concentrations (Figure 3).
To test if the metabolism of ectoine was affected in
CHR95, the fate of radioactive ectoine was analysed in
the presence or absence of 20 mM glucose as described
in Methods, and compared to that of the wild type strain.
According to previous studies [25], CO2 production due
to ectoine catabolism in the wild type strain was lower
(40-fold) in the presence of glucose, suggesting that
ectoine utilization is partially repressed by glucose. No
significant differences were found between CO2 production from ectoine by CHR95 and the wild type strain,
neither with nor without glucose addition (Figure 4a). In
both strains, most of the carbon backbone of ectoine (ca.
70% of the total radioactivity added) was found in the
ethanol soluble fraction (ESF), whereas only about 3.82%
of the total radioactivity added was found in the ethanol
insoluble fraction (EIF). No significative differences were
found in the radioactivity present in the ESF and EIF
fractions of the wild type and mutant strain. Glucose did
not influence the biosynthesis of molecules from ectoine
in any of these fractions (Figure 4b). These results suggested that whereas ectoine transport is deregulated in
mutant CHR95 at any salinity, ectoine metabolism is not
affected in this strain.

Figure 4 C. salexigens CHR95 is not affected in the metabolism of ectoine. Cells grown in M63 with 1.5 M NaCl up to exponential phase
were centrifuged, resuspended in the same medium to an OD600 of ca. 0.6, supplemented with 87 μM of [14C]-ectoine and incubated with and
without 20 mM of glucose. After 2 h incubation at 37°C, CO2 production from ectoine (A) and macromolecules (EIF, B) and cytoplasmatic solutes
(ESF, C) synthesized from ectoine, present in the ethanol insoluble and soluble fractions, respectively, were determined as described in Methods.
The data are the averages of three different replicates ± SD (standard deviation).

Transposon insertion in mutant CHR95 caused deletion of
genes for the acetyl-CoA synthase and two transcriptional
regulators

The salt sensitivity of strain CHR95, together with its
altered glucose metabolism and its capacity to use ectoines
as carbon sources at low salinity, prompted us to analyze
the gene(s) that was(were) affected by the Tn1732 insertion in this mutant. For this purpose, the DNA region
flanking the insertion was cloned in plasmid pRR1, which
was shown to carry Tn1732 (6.7-kb) plus about 14 kb of
adjacent DNA. To exactly localize the gene(s) disrupted by
the transposon, the DNA region flanking the insertion was
sequenced by using Tn1732 internal primers. As shown in
Figure 5, three genes were deleted by the Tn1732 insertion, named as Csal0865, Csal0866, and Csal0867 within
the C. salexigens genome sequence. Csal0865and Csal0866
were located in the forward strand and separated by a
260-bp intergenic region, whereas Csal0867 was located in
the complementary strand. The product of Csal0865
(hereafter Acs) was annotated as an acetyl CoA synthase,
which activates acetate to acetyl-CoA. In an iterative PSIBLAST search, it showed ca 70% of amino acid identity to
proteins annotated as acetyl CoA synthases from Rhodopseudomonas palustris and Vibrio cholerae. Genes
Csal0866 and Csal0867 were predicted to encode putative
transcriptional regulators. Thus, the Csal0866 product
(hereafter EupR) was annotated as a “two-component
LuxR family transcriptional regulator”. An iterative
PSI-BLAST search revealed a high identity (ca. 65-70%) to
proteins annotated as response regulators of gamma (i.e.

Vibrio, Pseudomonas, Shewanella, Marinobacter, Aeromonas) and alpha (ie. Bradyrhizobium, Labrenzia) proteobacteria. On the other hand, the protein encoded by Csal0867
(hereafter MntR) showed a high identity to manganesedependent transcriptional regulators of the DtxR/MntR
family such as MntR of E. coli. Moreover, it showed the
characteristic domains of these metalloregulators, i.e., an
N-terminal helix-turn-helix domain and a C-terminal
metal binding and dimerisation domain. mntR was preceded by two genes encoding a putative sensor histidine
kinase (Csal869) and a putative manganese transporter
(MntH), respectively. An in silico analysis of promoter and
transcriptional terminator regions showed two putative
s 70 -dependent promoters (one upstream of eupR and
another one upstream of the sensor histidine kinaseencoding gene), and a putative Rho-independent transcriptional terminator downstream of eupR.
The C. salexigens MntR regulator is involved in the
control of manganese uptake

In other bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis, MntR is a manganese-dependent metalloprotein involved in the regulation of manganese uptake. mntR mutants are manganesesensitive since MntR represses genes encoding Mn(II)
transporters. Thus, in the absence of MntR, manganese
uptake is deregulated and therefore manganese is toxic to
the cells [26]. Since the gene Csal0867 (encoding a putative MntR/DtxR-like global transcriptional regulator) was
deleted by the Tn1732 insertion in strain CHR95, we
generated a mntR strain (CHR161), in which the gene

encoding this transcriptional regulator was interrupted by
an omega cassette (Figure 5), and investigated its sensitivity to manganese. The wild type, mntR, and CHR95 strains
were plated on modified SW-2 plates with different MnCl2
concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 mM. As expected,
mutants CHR95 and CHR161 (mntR) did not grow with
any MnCl2 concentration (Figure 6). This finding, together
with the in silico analysis of the motifs in the protein
encoded by Csal0867, suggested that the mntR gene might
encode a manganese-dependent transcriptional regulator.

and Table 2). In contrast, mutant CHR183 (Csal0866)
reproduced the phenotype of strain CHR95 and was
able to use ectoine and, to a lower extent, hydroxyectoine as the sole carbon and energy sources at low
salinity (Figure 7 and Table 2). Like strain CHR95, and
if compared to the wild type, growth of CHR183

Deletion of the eupR gene in the CHR95 mutant is
responsible for deregulation of ectoine uptake

The results presented so far suggested that at least one
of the genes affected by the Tn1732 transposon insertion in C. salexigens CHR95 could be involved in the
regulation of ectoine uptake. Besides the gene encoding
the MntR regulator, the gene Csal0866 (eupR), encoding
a response regulator of a two-component system, was
deleted by the Tn1732 insertion in CHR95 (Figure 5).
Thus, we generated a mutant affected in this transcriptional regulator (CHR183) and tested its capacity to use
ectoines as carbon source at low salinity, as a measure
of enhanced transport at this salinity. The wild type and
CHR161 (mntR) strains were also included in the assay
for comparative purposes. Strains were grown in M63
medium with glucose, ectoine or hydroxyectoine as the
sole carbon sources, at salinities ranging from 0.6 to 2.5
M NaCl. No significant differences were found between
the growth of the mntR mutant and the wild type strain
with any carbon source at any salinity tested (Figure 7

incubation at 37°C for 48 h.

gene Csal0866 enables the strain to use ectoines as carbon source at low salinity, as a consequence of ectoine
transport deregulation at this salinity. Therefore, the
product of Csal0866 was named EupR (after Ectoine
uptake Regulator).
EupR is a response regulator of the NarL/FixJ family of
proteins

To further characterize EupR, we analyzed in detail its
domain composition and its phylogenetic relationship
with other proteins showing the same DNA-binding
domain. First, both NCBI/CDD and UniProt entries for
this protein included an N-terminal signal receiver
domain (REC) and a LuxR_C-like DNA-binding helixturn-helix (HTH) domain. All first 50 hits of the list

retrieved after iterative PSI-BLAST, inspected with the
CDD domain viewer [27], also showed the same domain
composition. Second, we searched Csal866 annotation
in the specialized Signaling Census database (see Methods), which includes total counts of signal transduction
proteins in completely sequenced genomes [28,29]. In
this database, Csal866 was included as a response regulator of the NarL family. As a matter of fact, published
classifications of response regulators based on effector
domains refer to NarL-like or NarL/FixJ-like proteins to
include response regulators with a REC and a HTH
DNA-binding domain, as the first structurally characterized HTH domain was from E. coli NarL [14,17]. The
DNA-binding C-terminal HTH domain of NarL-like
proteins was further proposed as a member of the
superfamily of the LuxR_C-like DNA-binding HTH
domains [30]. Thus, we made a phylogenetic analysis of
EupR and related proteins, all containing the common

paralog Csal_3030 (YP 575073) was related to the
S. meliloti FixJ regulator [31]. The second family
included transcriptional regulators that were not
response regulators of two components systems, but
proteins related to quorum sensing mechanisms. These
proteins shared the LuxR_C-like DNA binding domain
but showed an N-terminal autoinducer binding domain
typical of quorum sensing regulators. Although all these
regulators are involved in quorum sensing mediated
responses, they control a wide variety of cellular functions, from elastase expression in the case of P. aeruginosa LasR [34] to antibiotic production in the case of
P. carotovorum CarR [35]. The remaining proteins
formed separated and independent branches and only
showed the LuxR_C-like DNA binding domain. They
were involved in different functions like sporulation
control as GerE from B. subtilis [36] or biofilm formation as PsoR from P. putida [37]. All these data indicate
that EupR is a response regulator of two-component
regulatory systems of the NarL/FixJ family of proteins.

LuxR_C-like domain. These included well characterized
response regulators as well as other homologous but
uncharacterized proteins revealed by PSI-BLAST
searches, two EupR paralogs present in the C. salexigens
genome (also classified in the Signaling Census database
as response regulators of the NarL family), and “true”
LuxR transcriptional regulators related to quorum sensing. All these proteins were aligned by using ClustalW
and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the
Neighbor-joining algorithm of the MEGA 4 software. As
shown in Figure 8, the vast majority of the proteins
were grouped into two subtrees or families. The first
subtree comprised two-component response regulators
of the NarL/FixJ family, including well characterized
proteins such as the S. meliloti FixJ regulator (controlling nitrogen fixation genes [31]), the E. coli UhpA regulator (controlling the UhpT sugar phosphate transport
system [32]), and the E. coli NarL protein that controls
nitrate- and nitrite-regulated gene expression [33]. All
proteins in the first family showed the N-terminal signal
receiver phosphoacceptor domain (REC) and the
LuxR_C-like domain. Within this family, C. salexigens
EupR formed a separated branch with other three proteins of unknown function from Pseudomonas putida,
Aeromonas salmonicida and Vibrio harveyi. The EupR
paralog Csal_2132 (YP 574182) was closely related to
the BvgA virulence factors transcription regulator from
Bordetella pertussis (unpublished), whereas the EupR

Identification and analysis of the sensor histidine kinase
putatively associated to EupR

The classical two-component regulatory systems require
a response regulator protein and a sensor protein,
usually a membrane-bound sensor histidine protein
kinase [16]. To identify the cognate histidine kinase of
EupR, we used the the online application STRING 8.2
(http://string.embl.de/; [38]), a database and web
resource dedicated to predict protein-protein interactions including both physical and functional interactions.
STRING uses prediction algorithms based on data of
neighborhood, gene fusion and co-occurrence across
genomes, among others. A total of 21 histidine protein
kinases and 29 response regulators are included in the
genome of C. salexigens (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Complete_Genomes/SignalCensus.html) but only the
protein encoded by Csal869, located three genes downstream EupR (see Figure 5), was connected with EupR by
STRING with a high confidence score (0.772, composed
of a neighborhood score of 0.193 and a co-occurrence
across genomes score of 0.736). Predictions based on
STRING algorithms do not have the specificity of experimental data, but have enough statistical robustness as to
be considered reliable [38].
To make a deeper functional in silico analysis of this
signal transduction protein, we first compared it against
several domain databases (see Methods). As Figure 8b
shows, we found five distinct domains in the protein:
two N-terminal “input” or sensor domains (SSF and
PAS-PAC), a transmitter C-terminal region with a Hiscontaining phosphoaceptor HiskA domain and an ATPbinding HATPase domain, and a C-terminal signal
receiver domain (REC). The key residues (active site)

were conserved in HiskA, HATPase and REC domains.
Thus, this protein may be classified as a multi-sensor
hybrid histidine kinase. In fact, it was included as such
in the Signaling Census database [28,29]. Although sensory domains of histidine kinases are extremely diverse,
members of the same family domain typically recognize
the same (or very close) substrates [39]. Therefore, we
anticipated that the analysis of the two sensory domains
in our histidine kinase could help us to predict its putative function. The first one showed homology to transmembrane sensory domains like PutP (Na+/proline
symporter-like, in COG database) and SSF (sodium/
solute symporter family, in Pfam database). It was preceded by a signal peptide and predicted to form twelve
transmembrane helices. The second one, predicted to be
cytoplasmatic, showed two PAS subdomains followed by
a C-terminal PAC subdomain. In summary, the putative
cognate histidine kinase of EupR was predicted to be a
hybrid histidine kinase with both transmembrane and
cytoplasmic sensor domains, suggesting that it could
sense both external and internal conditions, and integrate them. Moreover, our in silico analysis supports the
hypothesis that it may be the sensor partner of EupR.

Discussion
In this work, we have characterized the Tn1732-induced
salt-sensitive mutant CHR95 of C. salexigens, which
showed a multiple affected phenotype: (i) inability to
grow with glucose at high salinity, but not affection in
the synthesis of compatible solutes, (ii) a slow growth
with glucose at low and optimal salinity, (iii) a reduced
uptake and metabolism of glucose, (iv) a deregulated
ectoine uptake at any salinity, and specially at low salinity, but unaffected ectoine metabolism, and (v) sensitivity to manganese. This pleiotropic phenotype was due to
deletion of three genes by the insertion of Tn1732, acs,
encoding a putative acetyl-CoA synthase, mntR, encoding a manganese-dependent transcriptional regulator of
the DtxR/MntR family, and eupR, encoding a twocomponent response regulator of the NarL/FixJ family
of transcriptional regulators. Transposon Tn1732 is a
derivative of Tn1721, which in turn is a member of the
Tn21 subgroup of the Tn3 family [40]. It has been
widely used for generalized insertion mutagenesis in
strains of Halomonas and Chromohalobacter, yielding
single mutants [41]. However, as any Tn1721-derivative,
it may cause deletions and inversions [42]. Thus, deletion of the region comprising acs-eupR-mntR upon
Tn1732 insertion in CHR95 is not surprising. In fact, in
the same mutagenesis experiment in which CHR95 was
isolated, we also isolated the salt-sensitive mutant
CHR62, showing a deletion of the ectABC genes [21,22].
Whereas the sensitivity of strain CHR95 to manganese
was correlated with the absence of mntR, its inability to

Page 11 of 17

grow with glucose at high salt, and the reduced transport and metabolism of glucose at low and optimal salinity (leading to a slow growth with this carbon source)
may be related to deletion of the acs and/or eupR genes.
The physiological role of the Acs enzyme is to activate
acetate to acetyl-coenzyme A (Ac-CoA), providing the
cell with the two-carbon metabolite used in many anabolic and energy generation processes [43]. Besides Acs
(YP_572921), C. salexigens genome encodes at least one
protein (YP_573871) showing a PRK03584 domain of
Ac-CoA synthases, and also two more proteins with
putative acyl CoA synthase domains (YP_573520 and
YP_574569). One or more of these proteins might compensate the lack of Acs in CHR95. In addition, it has
been reported that prokaryotic cells have evolved different pathways to obtain Ac-CoA, some of them independent of the acs gene [43]. Therefore, with the present
data we cannot conclude that deletion of the acs gene
influenced the ability of strain CHR95 to grow with glucose as the sole carbon source. The role of the response
regulator EupR in such a phenotype seems to be more
clearly established, as a single eupR mutant showed the
same growth pattern with glucose as the original mutant
CHR95.
Uptake of exogenous compatible solutes is preferred
over the synthesis, as it is energetically more favorable to
the cells [5]. In C. salexigens, the uptake of ectoine,
which can be used as a carbon source as well as an osmoprotectant, is maximal at optimal salinity and minimal at
low salinity, suggesting that ectoine transport is osmoregulated and most probably devoted to ectoine accumulation from the external medium. In agreement with these
transport data, ectoine(s) can be used as carbon source(s)
at optimal but not at low salinity [25]. Our previous studies on glucose and ectoine metabolism in this microorganism showed that glucose represses partially ectoine
catabolism [25]. However, strain CHR95, which was
affected in the transport and metabolism of glucose, did
not show an enhanced catabolism of ectoine. These
observations indicate that the ability of CHR95 to use
ectoine(s) as carbon source at low salinity is decoupled
from its impaired glucose catabolism. Rather, it was
related to a deregulated ectoine uptake, especially at low
salinity. Our results suggest that this phenotype is due to
the lack of the two-component response regulator EupR,
as a single eupR mutant reproduced the ability of CHR95
to use ectoine(s) as carbon source(s) at low salinity. Preliminary data on the expression of a transcriptional fusion
between the C. salexigens teaA gene, encoding the
ectoine binding protein of the TRAP-transporter for
ectoine(s), and the lacZ reporter gene, revealed that
expression of teaA in an eupR mutant at 0.75 M NaCl is
66% higher than in the wild type (J. Rodriguez-Moya,
unpublished results), supporting the hypothesis that

Rodríguez-Moya et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:256
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/256

EupR is involved in the transcriptional control of ectoine
uptake.
In the closely related H. elongata, the teaABC genes
(encoding the osmoregulated TRAP transporter for
ectoine) are followed by teaD, encoding a putative universal stress protein (USP). Deletion of teaD resulted in
an enhanced uptake for ectoine by the transporter
TeaABC, but it did not affect teaA mRNA-levels,
excluding a transcriptional regulation mechanism for
TeaD. Rather, TeaD was suggested to function either as
a translational regulator or as a direct/indirect regulator
of TeaABC transport activity [44]. EupR and TeaD proteins do not show homology to each other, as they
belong to different protein families and do not share
functional domains. Thus, whereas H. elongata TeaD
shows the conserved sensory domain of cytoplasmic
proteins of the Universal stress protein family [44],
C. salexigens EupR contains a single N-terminal receiver
domain and a C-terminal HTH DNA-binding domain of
the NarL/FixJ family of response regulators [14,17]. As
judged by the fact that the eupR mutant is salt-sensitive
and grows slower than the wild type with glucose, most
probably EupR regulates other processes, besides ectoine
uptake, which may or may not be related to the osmostress response. This seems to be also the case of OmpR
and MtrA, two response regulators involved in osmoadaptation in E. coli [13] and C. glutamicum [11], respectively. Our phylogenetic analysis grouped EupR with
proteins of unknown functions. Its closest characterized
relative was the E. coli NarL, which is responsible for
the control of nitrate- and nitrite-regulated gene expression [33]. However, assigning protein function based on
the function of its closest experimentally characterized
homolog is not readily applicable to signal transduction
components, as proteins with very similar sequences
may have dramatically different biological functions [39].
Therefore, we cannot infer a role of EupR in nitrateand nitrite-regulated gene expression, besides its involvement in the control of ectoine uptake.
The typical scheme of bacterial two-component signal
transduction involves signal sensing by a sensory histidine kinase that leads to its autophosphorylation,
followed by phosphoryl transfer to Asp residue in the
N-terminal REC domain of the cognate response regulator [16]. However, the cognate response regulator and
the histidine kinase are not always encoded in close
proximity to each other, which complicates their identification [14]. In any case, presence of a gene in the
neighborhood of a response regulator could strengthen
the case for the analyzed protein being a histidine kinase
[39]. The gene Csal869, located three genes downstream
of eupR, was predicted to be the cognate histidine kinase
associated to EupR. This protein satisfies all the key criteria to be considered as the sensory hybrid histidine

Page 12 of 17

kinase. The N-terminal sensor domains of the histidine
kinases vary greatly in sequence, membrane topology,
composition, and domain arrangement. This variability
presumably reflects different principles in stimulus perception and processing. For instance, E. coli KdpD
seems to have a cytoplasmic sensor domain (for K+)and
also a transmembrane-associated sensing mechanism
(osmolality) [15]. The histidine kinase putatively associated to EupR showed two sensor domains. The first
one was predicted to form twelve transmembrane
helices and was homologous to sodium/solute symporters (SSSF domain). The stimuli sensed by transmembrane sensory domains such as SSF are membrane
associated or occur directly within the membrane interface. They include turgor and mechanical stress, ion or
electrochemical gradients and transport processes. For
instance, the SSF domain is present in E. coli PutP [45],
which uses the free energy stored in electrochemical
Na+ gradients for the uptake of the compatible solute
proline. The second sensory domain was predicted to be
cytoplasmatic, and showed two PAS subdomains followed by a C-terminal PAC subdomain. Cytoplasmic
sensor domains such as PAS detect the presence of
cytoplasmic solutes or respond to diffusible or internal
stimuli, such as O 2 or H 2 , or stimuli transmitted by
transmembrane sensors.
This redundancy of sensory domains is not rare in
nature and in fact a large number of sensor kinases harbor more than one (putative) input domain [15]. The
most obvious explanation for the presence of two sensor
domains in the protein kinase putatively associated to
EupR is that it could sense both external and internal
conditions and integrate them. This will be the focus of
a further work.

Conclusions
This work paves the way to the elucidation of the osmosensing and signal transduction pathway leading to the
control of ectoine uptake in the model halophilic bacterium C. salexigens. Through the characterization of the
salt-sensitive mutant CHR95, we found the gene eupR,
encoding a two-component response regulator of the
NarL/FixJ family of transcriptional regulators. In our
view, the original annotation of EupR as a “two component LuxR family transcriptional regulator” was imprecise, as the EupR protein is not involved in quorum
sensing. However, it was precisely annotated in the specialized Signaling Census database, and further confirmed by our phylogenetic analysis, as a response
regulator of the NarL/FixJ family. Our results suggest
that EupR is not only involved in the control of ectoine
uptake, but also in other processes that might or not be
related to the C. salexigens osmostress response. Finally,
our bioinformatic analysis predicted that the gene

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/256

csal869 encodes a multi sensor hybrid histidine protein
kinase which could be the sensory partner of EupR. The
presence of two sensor domains in this protein suggest
that it could participate in the cross-talk between different signal transduction pathways, as it might be able to
sense both external (ions gradient, turgor stress, transport) and internal (cytoplasmatic solutes or proteins,
redox state) conditions and integrate them. Future work
should focus on (i) elucidating the EupR regulon
through transcriptomic analysis, (ii) the in vivo analysis
of the role of Csal869 as the cognate protein histidine of
EupR, and (iii) investigating if the putative EupR histidine kinase could sense the presence of solutes such as
ectoine(s) during uptake.

Methods
Bacterial strains, plasmids and growth conditions

The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are
described in Table 3. Strain CHR61, a spontaneous Rfr
mutant of C. salexigens DSM 3043, was used as the wild
type strain. CHR61 displays wild type growth at all conditions tested. C. salexigens strains were routinely grown
in complex SW-2 medium containing 2% (w/v) total

Page 13 of 17

salts Escherichia coli was grown aerobically in complex
Luria-Bertani (LB) medium M63 [48], which contains 20
mM glucose as the sole carbon source, was used as
minimal medium for C. salexigens. The osmotic strength
of M63 was increased by the addition of a 0.6 to 2.5 M
final concentration of NaCl. Although C. salexigens can
grow in M63 with 0.5 M NaCl, growth is extremely
slow at this salinity, and cells take a very long time to
reach exponential phase. Therefore, we used M63 with
0.6-0.75 M NaCl as the standard medium for a low salt
concentration in all experiments. The pH of all media
was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. Solid media contained
20 g of Bacto agar per liter (Difco). Otherwise stated,
cultures were incubated at 37°C in an orbital shaker at
200 rpm. When used, filter-sterilized antibiotics were
added at the following final concentrations (μg ml -1 ):
ampicillin (Ap), 150 for E. coli; chloramphenicol, 25
for E. coli; gentamicin (Gm), 20 for E. coli and 25 for
C. salexigens; kanamycin (Km), 50 for E. coli and 75 for
C. salexigens; rifampin (Rf), 25 for E. coli and C. salexigens; streptomycin (Sm), 20 for E. coli and 50 for
C. salexigens and geneticin (Gn), 20 for for E. coli and

ectoine and hydroxyectoine (bitop AG, Witten, Germany) were added to the media at a final concentration
of 20 mM. Growth was monitored as the optical density
of the culture at 600 nm (OD600) with a Perkin-Elmer
Lambda 25 UV/Vis spectrophotometer.
Conjugal transfer of plasmids

Plasmids were transferred from E. coli to C. salexigens
by triparental mating on SW-2 medium, using pRK600
as a helper plasmid, as described by Vargas et al. [46].
Methods for nucleic acid manipulation

Plasmid DNA was isolated from E. coli with a Wizard
Plus SV miniprep kit (Promega), and genomic DNA was
isolated with a SpinClean Genomic DNA Purification
Kit (Mbiotech). Restriction enzyme digestion and ligation were performed as recommended by the manufacturers (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech and Fermentas).
DNA sequencing was performed by Newbiotechnic
(Seville, Spain).
Transposon mutagenesis was performed by conjugal
transfer of pSUP102-Gm::Tn1732 from E. coli SM10
[40,49] to C. salexigens strain CHR61. Matings were carried out by mixing the donor and recipient cultures at a
ratio of 1:4 (100 μl of donor, 400 μl of recipient). The
mixed cultures were washed with sterile SW-2 medium
to eliminate the antibiotics. The pellet was resuspended
in 100 μl of SW-2 and placed on a 0.45-μm pore filter
on SW-2 solid media (which allows the growth of E. coli
and the putative salt-sensitive mutants of C. salexigens).
After overnight incubation at 30°C, cells were resuspended in 20% (v/v) sterile glycerol and, after appropriate dilutions, inoculated on SW-2 + rifampicin + Km
plates at a density resulting in about 100-200 colonies
per plate. Colonies from these master plates were transferred with sterile toothpicks to duplicate M63 plates,
one contained 2.7 M NaCl and the other contained 0.5
M NaCl. Plates were incubated at 37°C and inspected
for colonies that had grown at 0.5 M but not at 2.7 M
NaCl. One of these colonies was selected for further
experiments and was named CHR95.
To clone the DNA region flanking the Tn1732 insertion in CHR95, genomic DNA of this mutant was
digested with SacI, ligated to SacI-digested pKS(-) and
the ligation mix was used to transform E. coli DH5a
cells. From Kmr Apr colonies, the plasmid pRR1, containing the transposon Tn1732 within one SacI fragment
of about 20.7-kb, was isolated.
To generate C. salexigens mutants affected in mntR or
eupR, a 3.054-bp fragment from genome containing 680
bp of orf1, eupR, mntR and orf4 was PCR amplified with
Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) by using two
synthetic oligonucleotides (MntRfw: 5’-CATGCTGATCT
AGACGCTGTCGG-3’ and MntRrv: 5’-GCAGGCGGGC

Page 14 of 17

CCCATCTG-3’) that were modified (residues in bold) to
introduce a XbaI and an ApaI site, respectively (underlined). The resulting PCR fragment was digested with
XbaI and ApaI, and the 3,054-bp fragment generated was
cloned into pKS bluescript to give plasmid pMntREupR.
Subsequently, an HpaI or HindIII recognition site was
introduced in mntR or eupR respectively, using the PCRbased QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and the following oligonucleotides: MntRHpa_fw:
5’ CCGAATTGGTCGAGGACTATGTTAACGAGATTG
CGCATTTGC-3’, MntRHpa_rv: 5’-GCAAATGCGCA
ATCTCGTTAACATAGTCCTCGACCAATTCGG-3’,

TTCGCTTCCCCAGATGACC-3’, and EupRHind_rv:
5’-GGTCATCTCGGGAAGCGAAGCTTCGCCGGTGGT
GCGCCGTGC-3’, that were modified (residues in bold) to
introduce the corresponding restriction sites. The resultant plasmids, pHpaIMntR and pHindIIIEupR were linearized with the enzyme HpaI or HindIII and ligated to 2-kb
SmaI or HindIII fragments from pHP45-Ω [50] or pHP45Ωaac [51], containing the Ω interposons for insertional
mutagenesis (Smr or Gnr). The resulting plasmids were
named pΩMntR and pΩEupR. To recombine the mntR or
eupR mutations into the C. salexigens chromosome, 5-kb
XbaI-ApaII fragments from pΩMntR or pΩEupR were
cloned into the suicide vector pJQSK200 (Gmr) [52] to
give plasmids pJQMntR and pJQEupR, which were mobilized into the C. salexigens wild type strain by triparental
mating. Mutant strains resulting from a double homologous recombination event were identified as Smr Gms, or
Gnr Gms colonies on SW-2 plates containing 10% sucrose.
Two of these colonies were purified for further analysis
and were named CHR161 (mntR::Ω) and CHR183
(eupR::Ωaac). Insertions of the omega cassette in CHR161
and CHR183 were confirmed by PCR and sequencing.
Determination of sensitivity to Mn

To determine the sensitivity of C. salexigens strains to
Mn, we used fresh plates of a modified SW-2 medium
containing less than 1 mM of SO4Mg (to avoid interference of Mg2+ with Mn 2+ ), which was additioned with
0.5 to 2.5 mM MnCl 2 . An overnight culture of each
strain (100 μl) was spread onto the assay plate and
growth was observed after incubation at 37°C for 48 h.
Determination of ectoine uptake

Cells grown overnight in SW-2 were subcultured at a
1:100 dilution in glucose M63 medium containing 0.75,
1.5 or 2.5 M of NaCl, and grown up to exponential
phase (OD600 ca. 0.5). Transport was initiated by adding
[ 14 C]-ectoine to 0.2 ml of bacterial suspensions and
incubating the cultures at room temperature. The [14C]ectoine (5.5 MBq mM) was prepared biologically from
Brevibacterium linens as described [53] and was added

at a final concentration of 87 μM. During 2 min, 50 μl
of samples were taken at 30-s intervals, and transport
was terminated by rapid filtration through Whatman
GF/F discs (Fisher Bioblock, Illkirch, France). The cells
were quickly washed twice with 2 ml of isotonic M63
medium. The filters were solubilized in scintillation fluid
and radioactivity was determined in a Packard Liquid
Scintillation Analyzer, 1600 TR (Perkin Elmer, Courtabeouf, France). Transport rates were expressed as nmol
min-1 OD-1 unit.
Determination of the metabolic fate of [14C]-glucose

Cells grown overnight in SW-2 were subcultured at a
1:100 dilution in M63 containing 1.5 M NaCl and 20
mM glucose, and grown up to exponential phase (OD600
ca. 0.5). 2 ml samples were centrifuged, resuspended in
1.5 M NaCl M63 to an OD600 of ca. 0.6 and transferred
to a Warburg flask. 14C-labelled glucose (5.5 mCi/mmol,
390000 dpm/5 μl) was added at a final concentration of
100 μM to the samples. After different incubation times
at 37°C, 1 ml of sample was centrifuged for 10 min at
16000 g; 50 μl of supernatant was taken (twice) and
radioactivity was measured as above, indicating the glucose remaining in the supernatant (S, dpm ml-1). Cell
pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of H2O, extracted with
80 μl of pure ethanol and centrifuged for 10 min at
13000 rev min-1. The ethanolic supernatant was dried in
a Speed Vac (Savant Instruments, Holbrook, NY, USA),
and the solid residue was resuspended in 50 μl of H2O.
An aliquot of 10 μl was used to measure the radioactivity caused by the ethanol-soluble 28 compounds synthesized from glucose (ESF, dpm per OD unit). The
ethanol insoluble pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of
H 2O and used to measure the radioactivity caused by
the ethanol-insoluble compounds synthesized from glucose (EIF, dpm per OD unit).

taken (twice) and radioactivity was measured as above,
indicating the ectoine remaining in the supernatant (S,
dpm ml-1); and (iii) cell pellet was resuspended in 20 μl
of H2O, extracted with 80 μl of pure ethanol and centrifuged for 10 min at 13 000 rev min- 1 . The ethanolic
supernatant was dried in a Speed Vac (Savant Instruments, Holbrook, NY, USA), and the solid residue was
resuspended in 50 μl of H2O. An aliquot of 10 μl was
used to measure the radioactivity caused by the ethanolsoluble compounds synthesized from ectoine (ESF, dpm
per OD unit). The ethanol insoluble pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of H2O and used to measure the radioactivity caused by the ethanol-insoluble compounds
synthesized from ectoine (EIF, dpm per OD unit).
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were
conducted using MEGA version 4 [54]. C. salexigens
EupR and other LuxR family proteins including well
characterized members of different subclasses with a
common LuxR-C-like conserved domain and others different domains were included in the phylogenetic analyses. We also included some uncharacterized proteins
with a high similarity to C. salexigens EupR, including
two paralogs present in C. salexigens genome.
The sequences were aligned with clustalW (1.6) using
a BLOSUM62 matrix and manually edited. The phylogenetic tree was inferred using the Neighbor-joining
method [55] and the evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method. The rate
variation among sites was modelled with a gamma distribution (shape parameter = 1.5) and all the positions
containing gaps and missing data were eliminated only
in pairwise sequence comparisons. The robustness of
the tree branches was assessed by performing bootstrap
analysis of the Neighbor-joining data based on 1000
resamplings [56].

Determination of the metabolic fate of [14C]-ectoine

Cells grown overnight in SW-2 were subcultured at a
1:100 dilution in M63 containing 1.5 M NaCl and 20
mM glucose and grown up to exponential phase (OD600
ca. 0.5). Two independent 2 ml samples were centrifuged, resuspended in 1.5 M NaCl M63 to an OD600 of
ca. 0.6 and transferred to a Warburg flask. 14C-labelled
ectoine (5.5 MBq mM) was added at a final concentration of 87 μM to the samples. Glucose was added to
one of the samples at a final concentration of 20 mM.
After 2-h incubation at 37°C, the fate of radioactive
ectoine was analysed as follows: (i) respired radioactive
CO 2 was trapped on a strip of 3 MM Whatman filter
paper moistened with 50 μl of 6 mol l- 1 of KOH and
14
CO2 production (dpm per OD600 unit) was measured
by liquid scintillation; (ii) 1 ml of sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 16000 g; 50 μl of supernatant was
