Abstract
Background: Photorhabdus are Gram-negative nematode-symbiotic and insect-pathogenic bacteria. The species
Photorhabdus asymbiotica is able to infect humans as well as insects. We investigated the secreted proteome of a
clinical isolate of P. asymbiotica at different temperatures in order to identify proteins relevant to the infection of the
two different hosts.
Results: A comparison of the proteins secreted by a clinical isolate of P. asymbiotica at simulated insect (28°C) and
human (37°C) temperatures led to the identification of a small and highly abundant protein, designated Pam, that is
only secreted at the lower temperature. The pam gene is present in all Photorhabdus strains tested and shows a high
level of conservation across the whole genus, suggesting it is both ancestral to the genus and probably important to
the biology of the bacterium. The Pam protein shows limited sequence similarity to the 13.6 kDa component of a
binary toxin of Bacillus thuringiensis. Nevertheless, injection or feeding of heterologously produced Pam showed no
insecticidal activity to either Galleria mellonella or Manduca sexta larvae. In bacterial colonies, Pam is associated with an
extracellular polysaccharide (EPS)-like matrix, and modifies the ability of wild-type cells to attach to an artificial surface.
Interestingly, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) binding studies revealed that the Pam protein itself has adhesive
properties. Although Pam is produced throughout insect infection, genetic knockout does not affect either insect
virulence or the ability of P. luminescens to form a symbiotic association with its host nematode, Heterorhabditis
bacteriophora.
Conclusions: We studied a highly abundant protein, Pam, which is secreted in a temperature-dependent manner in P.
asymbiotica. Our findings indicate that Pam plays an important role in enhancing surface attachment in insect blood.
Its association with exopolysaccharide suggests it may exert its effect through mediation of EPS properties. Despite its
abundance and conservation in the genus, we find no evidence for a role of Pam in either virulence or symbiosis.
Background
Photorhabdus bacteria are pathogens of insects, and obligate symbionts with insect-pathogenic Heterorhabditid
nematodes [1,2]. These host nematodes invade an insect
and regurgitate the bacteria from their gut [3]. The bacteria then colonize the infected insect and release both
insecticides that kill the insect host and antibiotics to kill

any invading and competing microbes [4]. Following several rounds of nematode and bacterial replication, a new
generation of infective juvenile (IJ) nematodes re-uptake
the bacteria and exit the cadaver to find new hosts [1].
This dual requirement for symbiosis and virulence makes
Photorhabdus an excellent model organism for studying
bacterial colonization and developmental behaviour in
addition to a potential source of potent new insecticidal
proteins and antibiotics [2]. The genus Photorhabdus
comprises three distinct species: P. temperata, P. luminescens and P. asymbiotica. Although all three are highly

pathogenic to insects, P. asymbiotica was originally isolated from human wounds and its nematode vector has
only recently been identified [5]. Little is known about
transmission into human patients, but P. asymbiotica is
unique in the genus in being able to grow at 37°C and is
considered an emerging human pathogen [6]. In an
attempt to find potential host-interacting proteins that
are relevant to either human or insect infections we used
two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis to compare
supernatant proteins secreted at 28°C and 37°C. We identified a number of proteins that were differentially produced at these temperatures. Two small proteins were of
particular interest, because they were secreted at a very
high level at 28°C but were not detectable at the clinically
relevant temperature of 37°C. One of these proteins was
encoded by a gene on a plasmid found only in P. asymbiotica strains. The other was encoded by a chromosomal
gene previously identified in a proteomic study of P. luminescens TT01 [7]. We present here the first detailed
investigation into the role of this second highly secreted
protein present in both P. luminescens and P. asymbiotica.

Results
Identification of Pam by two-dimensional electrophoretic
analysis of the P. asymbiotica ATCC43949 secreted proteins

Given the availability of P. asymbiotica ATCC43949
genomic sequence and the ability of this strain to grow at
both clinically relevant (37°C) and insect relevant (28°C)
temperatures, we used proteomics to identify secreted
proteins that may be important for the two different
hosts. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of supernatant proteins revealed two small highly abundant proteins
(initially designated S1 and S15) that were secreted at
28°C but not at 37°C (Fig. 1). We compared the MALDI-

ToF profiles of these proteins with a database of all the
predicted proteins from the finished P. asymbiotica
genome sequencing project [8] for their identification.
One of these proteins, S1, was found to be encoded by a
gene present on the plasmids of clinical P. asymbiotica
strains but absent from all P. temperata and P. luminescens strains so far examined. This plasmid, pPAU1, has
homology to the Yersinia pestis pMT1 plasmid, which is
essential for vectoring by the flea host. The small S1 protein is similar to the YPMT1.14c hypothetical protein
which has a bacterial Ig-like domain (group 2) although
its function is not known. The second protein, S15
(renamed Pam: Photorhabdus adhesion modification protein), matched Plu1537 previously identified in proteomic
studies of P. luminescens TT01 [7]. In strain TT01, the
product of the plu1537 gene is the most highly secreted
protein, accounting for more than 30% of the total extracellular proteins. The P. asymbiotica ATCC43949 homologue is a protein of 136 amino acids with a predicted
mass of 14.98 kDa and a calculated isoelectric point of
4.7. Searches of current protein databases show limited
similarity to known proteins. The best sequence match is
seen between amino acids 19-121 of Pam which show
31% identity to amino acids 10-111 of the 13.6 kDa component of a Bacillus thuringiensis binary toxin [9]. Injectable insecticidal activity has been reported for Pit, a
protein encoded by the homologous gene of pam in P.
luminescens subsp. akhurstii strain YNd185 [10]. We
used PCR to elucidate the distribution of the s1 and pam
genes in the genus Photorhabdus (data not shown). As
predicted, the gene encoding S1 was only seen in the
plasmid-carrying P. asymbiotica isolates and is presumably of relevance only to these strains [8]. An alignment of

several proteins with differential levels of production in these conditions, including S1 and S15 (circled) which are only secreted at 28°C.

luminescens TT01 revealed a high level of DNA homology (87.5%). We amplified and sequenced pam from 13
other strains of the genus Photorhabdus. Sequence comparison of the predicted proteins revealed very high
amino acid conservation, with 89.6% similarity between
even the most diverse sequences. In addition, the inferred
phylogeny of the pam genes from different members of
the genus follows the same clade-groupings as multilocus sequence typing data [5] suggesting that pam is
ancestral to the genus. In order to facilitate further analysis of the Pam protein an antibody was raised to a peptide
(KLIQDSIRLDQGEW) conserved in the Pam protein
family.
In vivo and in vitro production of Pam

As the identification of highly-secreted Pam occurred at
28°C, a temperature relevant to the infection of insect
hosts, we monitored Pam production over time in Galleria mellonella larvae injected with either P. luminescens
TT01 (Fig. 2A) or P. asymbiotica ATCC43949 (Fig. 2B).
We observed high levels of production in the insect host
at 48 h post-injection which continued for a further 11
days, suggesting a possible role of this secreted protein in
the occupation of the insect cadaver. It is also possible
that Pam is produced in the insect before 48 h and has
not been detected with our methods. We were unable to

isolate tissues within the insect for Pam-specific production patterns due to internal disruption of the cadaver 48
h after infection. In vitro production of Pam was monitored in P. asymbiotica ATCC43949 liquid cultures, and it
was first detected in supernatants by Western blot after 6
h 30 min of growth in LB medium at 28°C, corresponding
to the exponential phase of the culture (Fig. 3A). Pam
continued to be produced throughout growth into stationary phase (48 h) and up to 6 day-old cultures (data
not shown). As expected, no Pam was released at 37°C
although cell-associated Pam could be detected, indicating it is synthesized but not released into the surrounding
milieu. The fact that Pam protein is released only at
insect-relevant temperatures and the difficulties with
genetic manipulation and transformation of P. asymbiotica strain ATCC43949, led us to make a pam knock-out

was injected with (A) P. luminescens TT01 or (B) P. asymbiotica
ATCC43949, and was frozen and crushed in 1 ml of buffer at days 1 to
10 and 13 post injection. 10 μl of each sample was used per lane for
SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis using anti-Pam antibody showed
production from the second day after infection. The arrow indicates
that Pam is not produced by Photorhabdus in the first day of G. mellonella infection or that it is below the detection limit of the assay.

strain in the well-characterized P. luminescens TT01. Figure 3B shows a Western blot demonstrating the absence
of Pam in the mutant strain TT01pam. For heterologous
expression in E. coli, pam was amplified from P. asymbiotica ATCC43949 and cloned in the arabinose-inducible
vector pBAD30, under translational control of its native
Shine-Dalgarno region. Heterologous production of Pam
was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 3C). The recombinant protein was purified using ion-exchange chromatography for further analysis (Fig. 3D).
Pam does not influence insect virulence or nematode
symbiosis

Given Pam's similarity to a part of the B. thuringiensis
13.6 kDa Cry toxin and the previous insecticidal studies
on the homologous pit from strain YNd185 [10], we
tested Pam for toxicity to insects. First, we compared the
virulence of the TT01pam strain with the TT01rif parental strain by injection into G. mellonella using standard
LT50 assays, where approx 100 cells from a diluted overnight culture were injected per insect, and 100 insect larvae were used per treatment. No significant delay in
insect death of the TT01pam strain (LT50 = 49.7 h) relative to the TT01rif (LT50 = 48.0 h) was observed, indicating that Pam does not play a major role in insect
pathogenicity. We also injected G. mellonella and M.
sexta larvae with a range of dilutions from suspensions of
sonicated E. coli cells producing Pam, but we saw no toxicity (data not shown). Finally, to assess oral toxicity, we
fed M. sexta neonate larvae with suspensions of sonicated
cells producing Pam. We observed no significant differences in larval weight gain after one week (expressed in
average grams ± standard error) between E. coli expressing pam (0.1165 ± 0.005), E. coli control carrying the
empty vector (0.0952 ± 0.009) and PBS buffer as control
(0.1154 ± 0.010), indicating that Pam does not cause oral
toxicity or delay in feeding in M. sexta. Our data suggest
no role of Pam in insect virulence under the conditions
tested.
We examined the ability of TT01pam to form an effective symbiosis with the host nematode Heterorhabditis
bacteriophora. We saw no defect in transmission efficiencies (mean ± s.e.) of TT01pam (0.954 ± 0.023) when compared to TT01 wild type (0.954 ± 0.025). We also
observed no significant differences between nematodes
carrying TT01pam and those carrying TT01 wild type
when we assessed other traits relevant for symbiosis such
as: recovery from infective juveniles (IJ stage) to hermaphrodites (adult stage) and development to second
generation in vitro, repackaging of the bacteria and infection of G. mellonella with re-coupled EPN-complex and
emergence yield (data not shown). The results from all
the aspects investigated suggest that Pam is not essential

either for the symbiotic stage of the Photorhabdus lifecycle or for pathogenic activity in the insect.
Pam binds to EPS in the extracellular matrix and modifies
cell attachment

To investigate the localization of Pam in P. luminescens
TT01 cells, sections of bacterial colonies were observed
under transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealing
large amounts of exopolysaccharide (EPS)-like matrix filling the spaces between cells (Fig. 4A). We used immunogold localization of Pam in these sections and found that
the protein is associated with this extracellular material
that is distributed surrounding the cells (Fig. 4B). In
TT01pam the EPS-like material was still present but we
did not see specific binding of the antibody (Fig. 4C), suggesting that although Pam binds to the extracellular
matrix, it does not significantly alter its production or
general structure. Furthermore, Western-blot analysis
using the anti-Pam antibody revealed that Pam could be
detected in crude EPS preparations (Fig 4D), confirming
that from all the extracellular matrix components Pam
binds at least to EPS. Our studies revealed that EPSbound Pam can be released by the action of SDS and salt
(KCl) but not by mechanical disruption (vortex) (data not
shown).
As Pam binds to EPS and EPS has been shown to be
important in biofilm formation [11], we investigated the
possibility that Pam influences the different stages of biofilm formation. Pellicle assays and biofilm growth in
microscopy chambers did not show differences in mature
biofilm formation between TT01rif and TT01pam (data
not shown). To analyze the influence of Pam on the early
steps of biofilm formation, namely initial attachment, we
looked at attachment of the two strains to glass coverslips
when cultured ex vitro in hemolymph plasma. As shown
in Figure 5, the parental TT01rif cells attached in greater
numbers than TT01pam to the glass surface in hemolymph, but not in LB medium or Schneiders insect
growth medium (data not shown). Importantly, we were
also able to detect Pam in cell and supernatant fractions
in bacteria grown in hemolymph plasma at 8 hours.
To study in more detail the role of Pam in attachment
and its adhesive properties, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to measure binding to an abiotic gold surface. First, we used washed cells in an attempt to assess
the role of Pam when it is bound to the EPS surrounding
the bacterium: TT01pam showed increased binding to
the surface compared to the parental TT01rif (Fig. 6A),
indicating that the presence of the protein reduces adhesion to the surface in these conditions. Similarly, in Pamexpressing E. coli we observed a decrease in adhesion
compared to E. coli control (Fig. 6B). Using SPR to assess
the effect of Pam secreted into the medium, we analyzed
the supernatants of cultures. In this case we found the

opposite effect: when Pam, either from TT01rif or
recombinant E. coli cultures, was secreted in the supernatant we observed a greater change in SPR angle, indicating that in the presence of Pam more material bound to
the gold surface than from the supernatant of cells lacking Pam, TT01pam and control E. coli (Figs. 6C and 6D).
We checked that this effect was due specifically to the
presence of Pam in the supernatant by blocking Pam
binding with addition of the anti-Pam antibody (X.
Muñoz-Berbel, M. Sanchez-Contreras and A. T. A. Jenkins, unpublished data). These results suggest that

secreted Pam binds to surfaces, while when Pam is bound
to the cell surface it makes these cells less able to attach.
Structural studies of Pam

In order to better understand the physicochemical properties that confer on Pam the ability to bind EPS and
influence cell attachment, we investigated the structural
properties of the protein by circular dichroism (CD)
spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC). CD spectra at near-UV and far-UV wavelengths
were obtained for purified heterologously produced Pam.

Figure 5 Comparison of bacterial attachment to surfaces in presence of insect hemolymph by fluorescence microscopy between
TTO1rif and the pam mutant. Cells were grown on glass coverslips at
28°C for 8 hours. Planktonic bacteria were washed off and adherent
bacteria were fixed and stained with DAPI. The adherence of TT01pam
(B) is presented as a percentage of the data determined for the corresponding parental strain TT01rif (A). Bacterial counts were performed
at 60× magnification and the data represent the mean values of 12
fields from triplicate experiments (± St.Dev) (C).

Weak spectra were recorded in the near-UV, but a strong
signal was obtained between 182 nm and 240 nm in the
far-UV range. A large positive maximum at 192 nm and
negative maxima at 208 nm and 222 nm indicate that the
secondary structure of the protein is largely α-helical
[12]. Analysis of the spectra using the CDSSTR variable
selection method gave secondary structure estimates of
58% helix, 8% strand, 16% turns and 18% unordered
structure. The normalized root mean standard deviation
(NRMSD) for the estimates provides a goodness-of-fit
measure of the correspondence between the experimental and calculated spectra (Fig. 7A); we obtained a
NRMSD value of 0.011, which suggests a very accurate
prediction of the secondary structure. However, this prediction depends ultimately on how closely the reference
dataset proteins used to derive the calculated spectra
share structural similarity to Pam [13].
The temperature stability of Pam was measured using
DSC. Energy changes in purified recombinant protein
were recorded as the sample was heated at a constant rate
from 20°C to 95°C. The sample was then allowed to cool
before the analysis was repeated. The thermal transition
curve measured for Pam reveals two things: firstly, the
protein is relatively thermostable, not undergoing a
change in enthalpy until the temperature of the system
was above 60°C, and reaching a transition midpoint at
77.4°C. Above this midpoint, energy is released and the
thermal profile drops toward the baseline (Fig. 7B). Secondly, upon reheating Pam follows a similar profile,
except for a slight shoulder between approximately 60°C
and 70°C. This shoulder is indicative of misfolding, with

Discussion
We have studied a previously identified protein (Plu1537,
here renamed Pam) which in P. asymbiotica ATCC43949
is secreted in a temperature-dependent manner, suggestive of a host-specific role in insects. In the closely related
insect-only pathogen P. luminescens TT01, Pam has been
estimated to constitute more than 30% of total secreted
protein [7], potentially indicating an important role in the
lifestyle of this bacterium. Further sequence alignment
and the inferred phylogeny of the pam genes from different Photorhabdus species suggest that pam is both ancestral and conserved throughout the genus. Where variable
regions in amino acid sequence do exist, they could
therefore be responsible for determining functional specificity of the protein within strains.
Given the characteristic dual lifecycle of Photorhabdus,
with both a nematode-symbiotic and a insect-pathogenic
stage, the limited similarity of Pam with B. thuringiensis
Cry34 insecticidal protein, and the previous insecticidal
studies with Pit [10], the first phenotypes tested with the
pam mutant were toxicity to insects and symbiotic efficiency with the bacterium's partner nematode H. bacteriophora. Interestingly, the deletion of the pam gene did
not affect the ability of P. luminescens TT01 to support
nematode growth, the production of infective juveniles,
re-association of the bacteria with the worm or their ability to re-infect an insect. Similarly, we were not able to
demonstrate any difference in insect survival (measured
by LT50) when G. mellonella were injected with wild-type
or pam mutant strains, but this could result from the high
redundancy of virulence factors in Photorhabdus [14]. In
the case of Pam recombinant protein, which did not
cause toxicity either by injection or feeding assays, it is
possible that Pam is not toxic by itself but requires a second, as yet unidentified, protein partner that operates in a
binary toxin-type system. The closest known homolog of
Pam is the 13.6 kDa Cry34 protein from B. thuringiensis,
which only exerts effective mortality when coupled with
its partner Cry35 [15,16]. The precise mode of action of
Cry34 toxins remains unclear, but susceptible insects
show histopathological symptoms in the midgut epithelium, characterized by cell blebbing and vacuolation [9].
We have not found any genes in Photorhabdus that are
predicted to encode a component similar to Cry35. It
should be noted that our findings are contrary to reports
of toxicity of purified Pam protein by Li and co-workers
[10]. It is possible that the Pam variant they produced
(Pit) as a GST-fusion from P. luminescens subsp. akhurstii
YNd185, either has a much greater inherent toxicity to G.

mellonella, or that the different method of purification
used by these authors preserved Pam's toxic phenotype.
The fact that we did not find any toxic effect of Pam
towards insects, or any decrease in the efficiency of interaction with the symbiotic nematode, led us to investigate
whether it was expressed during insect infection at all.
Western blots with anti-Pam antibody against proteins
isolated from infected insects suggested that Pam was
first produced at 48 h and not earlier during the infection
process, and that it was continuously produced for at
least 11 days after insect death. Although the possibility
exists that earlier production was below the detection
limit of our assay, we note that 48 h coincides with death
of the insect as determined by LT50 assays. These results
indicate that Pam may play a role in occupancy of the

insect cadaver rather than killing of the host and are consistent with a previous study of P. luminescens genes
upregulated upon insect infection, in which pam
(plu1537) was not present among the identified genes
encoding several toxins and metabolic enzymes [17]. We
have detected Pam both as secreted protein in the extracellular medium and bound to the EPS decorating the
extracellular matrix surrounding cells. However, the
observable structure of EPS/matrix is not significantly
altered by the presence or absence of Pam. Although we
observed no differences in mature biofilm, we found that
Pam influences the early stages of bacterial attachment in
hemolymph. SPR data from E. coli and P. luminescens cultures showed that membrane-bound Pam reduces the
ability of cells to bind to the abiotic surface of the metallic

Figure 7 Structural properties of Pam. (A) Graphical output of far-UV CD data for Pam reveals that experimental data (green crosses) and calculated
spectrum (blue boxes), derived from the calculated output secondary structure, show agreement. The difference spectrum (purple lines) is very close
to zero throughout the wavelength range, indicating the goodness of fit of the structural predictions. The CD data indicate that Pam is largely helical
(58%), with only a small fraction of residues forming β-strands. (B) Thermal stability of Pam measured by differential scanning calorimetry. The normalised thermal transition curve (red line) shows energy uptake by Pam reached a peak (Tm) at 77.4°C, representing the temperature at which 50% of
the protein molecules are unfolded. This was almost identical after cooling the sample and repeating (black line).

gold of the probe, and that the secreted protein itself is
able to bind to this surface. The observation that Pam
expression increases binding to an abiotic surface in
insect blood is in contrast to the findings from the SPR
analysis which suggest Pam lowers the adhesive properties of the cell. However these observed differences in
attachment between the wild type and pam mutant in the
hemolymph are not directly comparable with the SPR
data. In the first case the cells are grown in the media
where attachment is assessed and the combination of
secreted and cell-bound Pam contributes to the phenotype, while for SPR we analyzed washed cells and supernatant separately. Furthermore, insect blood is a far more
complex environment than the PBS used to resuspend
the cells in the SPR study, so potential interactions of Pam
and the bacterium with components of the insect
immune system must be considered. Together, these data
indicate that Pam is a secreted adhesive factor that modifies the surface properties of the cell, affecting the attachment process, specifically cell-to-cell and cell-to-surface
attachment. Although it is important to note that attachment to abiotic substrata is not the same as attachment to
living or devitalized tissue, we believe that this modification of adhesion by Pam may be involved in one or several
processes key to the biology of the bacterium. For
instance, once Photorhabdus has been regurgitated by IJ
nematodes, it must colonize and invade the midgut [4]
and this establishment of a biofilm, following attachment,
is recognized as an important step in many microbial
infections [18]. Since the effect of deleting Pam does not
result in a complete gain or loss of attachment, the protein may allow some plasticity in colonization during the
infection. Perhaps Pam allows adhesion to specific tissues
or a transient attachment, or even to facilitate the release
of cells from biofilms to colonize other tissues within the
host, acting in an analogous manner to glycanases
described other biofilm-forming bacteria [19].
The predicted amino acid sequence of Pam gives little
clue to its role or of the potential structure that mediates
its adhesive properties. To get an insight into the structure of Pam, we analyzed the protein with circular dichroism spectroscopy. Our far-UV CD data strongly indicate
that Pam is a helical protein, with 5.5 helix segments per
100 residues and an average helix length of 10.5 residues.
By contrast, only 8% of residues are expected to form βstrands. We obtained only very weak spectra for Pam in
the near-UV wavelengths, but 1D 1H and 2D 1H-15N
HSQC NMR spectra (data not shown) and high melting
temperature from differential scanning calorimetry
experiments confirm that the protein has well defined
tertiary structure. A degree of tertiary structural prediction is available from the far-UV spectra, specifically the
position of the spectral cross-over from positive to negative, and the magnitude of the negative maximum at 208

nm [20]. These both suggest that Pam is a α+β protein.
Rather than having intermixed segments, such proteins
have separate α-helix and β-sheet-rich regions [21]. Interestingly, although Pam is not secreted at 37°C in P. asymbiotica, it shows thermal stability far beyond this.
Differential scanning calorimetry revealed that the protein does not begin to thermally denature until heated to
temperatures above 60°C. The transition midpoint is
77.4°C, suggesting that Pam is particularly thermostable
for a protein produced by an organism considered to be
psychrophilic [22]. In fact, this midpoint is approaching
that seen in thermophilic bacteria and archaea [23-25].
Without high resolution structural analyses we are unable
to explore precise contributions to the thermal stability of
Pam, but the high α-helix content is likely to be significant; thermostable proteins are richer in α-helices than
mesophilic proteins [26]. The observed ability of Pam to
refold to its native conformation following denaturation
may be biologically significant; this folding indicates that
the protein can form its native structure in the absence of
molecular chaperones, outside of the cell if it is secreted
as an unfolded polypeptide. It is as yet not clear how Pam
is secreted from the cell as we can detect no recognizable
signal motifs, neither were found in Pit [10].
Finally, although the role of this highly secreted protein
in Photorhabdus biology has not yet been completely elucidated, we have shown its possible relevance in cell
attachment. Our findings indicate that Pam is a secreted
adhesive factor of Photorhabdus that modifies attachment of cells to surfaces in biotic (hemolymp) and abiotic
(SPR) conditions. Thus, it might be involved at different
cell-cell and cell-surface adhesion stages during the insect
host colonization, such as the production of a biofilm-like
matrix on the insect gut, the spread of bacteria within the
insect cadaver and potentially a resource protection role,
binding to the insect tissues and preventing other saprophites from taking advantage of the biomass. The high
levels of secretion and the degree of conservation within
the genus are congruent with Pam modulating these
important activities. Very little is known about Photorhabdus infections in humans, but a recent study has
found that, unlike the extracellular growth of P. luminescens in insects [27], a clinical isolate of P. asymbiotica is a
facultative intracellular pathogen when incubated with
human macrophage-like cells [28]. Future studies may
investigate what role if any Pam has in the infection of
mammalian cells.

Conclusions
In this study we show that the highly abundant Pam protein is able to bind to exopolysaccharides and change the
attachment properties of Photorhabdus. Deletion of pam
altered bacterial adhesion to surfaces but did not cause a
decrease in virulence towards Galleria mellonella larvae.

However, Pam is produced during insect infection suggesting a role for this protein in the insect cadaver, possibly in the colonization of the insect body. Sequence
analysis of pam in multiple isolates showed that it is
ancestral and conserved in the genus Photorhabdus and
thus deserves further investigations to clarify its role in
the complex cycle of Photorhabdus biology.

Methods
Bacterial strains, plasmids and culture conditions. DNA
amplification and cloning

The strains used in this study are: P. asymbiotica strain
ATCC43949 [29], P. luminescens subspecies laumondii
strain TT01 [30] and a wild-type spontaneous rifampicinresistant P. luminescens TT01rif (this study). A knock-out
strain in the pam gene was constructed from TT01rif and
named TT01pam. The pam gene was deleted from the
chromosome by allelic exchange using the suicide vector
pDS132 [31] and correct chromosomal deletion was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing of the region near
the deleted gene. The pam knock-out strain grew similarly to the wild-type strain in rich and minimal media
and insect plasma (filtered hemolymph). Escherichia coli
EC100 (Epicentre Biotechnology, USA) was used for heterologous production of Pam. The pam gene was PCR
amplified from P. asymbiotica ATCC43949 genomic
DNA using the primers PamF: 5' TTAATCTTGGAATTCATTAAACACATT 3' and PamR: 5' TTAAAGCTTAGGTTACAATAGTATATTCT 3'. Using EcoRI and
HinDIII restriction sites incorporated in the primers, the
product was directionally cloned downstream of an arabinose-inducible promoter in the pBAD30 plasmid [32] to
create the pBADpam expression construct. Pam expression in E. coli EC100 containing pBADpam was induced
by addition of 0.2% (w/v) L-arabinose overnight, and E.
coli EC100 carrying pBAD30 empty vector was used as
control. Cloned P. asymbiotica ATCC43949 pam in pET28α (Novagen, USA) and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3)
(Novagen, USA) was used for the feeding assays, and
compared to E. coli EC100 carrying pET-28α as control.
Strains were grown with 250 rpm agitation on LB
medium [33] supplemented when required with 50 μg ml1 rifampicin, 100 μg ml-1 ampicillin, 10 μg ml-1 tetracycline and 100 μg ml-1 kanamycin. E. coli strains were
grown at 37°C, P. luminescens TT01 and its derivatives at
28°C and P. asymbiotica at both temperatures depending
on the assay. For pellicle assays [34] and biofilm in
microscopy chambers (Ibidi) strains were grown statically
in LB and Grace's/Schneider's insect media (Sigma).
Amplification of the s1 gene from P. asymbiotica isolates was performed using the primers s1F: 5'TATGAATTCATAAGTAAGGAT 3' and s1R: 5' CGGTGTTTT
AGTAAGCTTCTATCT 3'.

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, Western blot and
Pam protein purification

From a starting overnight culture (28°C) of P. asymbiotica
ATCC43949, cultures were inoculated and grown for 24 h
at 28°C and 37°C until early stationary phase. Proteins
from both supernatants were phenol precipitated and
resuspended in 150 μl CDU buffer (4% CHAPS, 130 mM
DTT and 9 M Urea) containing 1 × HALTTM protease
Inhibitor Cocktail Mix (Pierce, Thermo Fisher, UK). Samples were incubated for 2 h at room temperature, then
centrifuged for 30 min at 88 760 × g. The RediPlate Protein Quantitation Kit (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, UK)
was used to quantify protein concentration in the samples and equivalent amounts of total proteins were
loaded. A Multiphor II system (GE Healthcare, UK) was
used for isoelectric focusing and horizontal SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Immobiline DryStrip
gels and precast 12.5% SDS gels (GE Healthcare, UK), following the manufacturer's instructions. Gels were Coomassie stained and protein spots were excised and sent to
the protein sequencing facility at the University of the
West of England (Bristol, UK). The peptide sequences
resulting from MALDI analysis of trypsin-digested proteins, were compared to all proteins in the SwissProt nonredundant database and to a database of predicted proteins from the P. asymbiotica ATCC43949 genome
sequence [8].
A polyclonal anti-Pam antibody was raised in rabbits
against the peptide KLIQDSIRLDQGEW (amino acid
positions 28-41) from P. asymbiotica ATCC43949 by
GenScript Corporation (USA). For Western blot, proteins
were precipitated with 1/10 volumes of 100% Trichloroacetic acid, separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a
Trans-Blot nitrocellulose membrane (BioRad, USA) using
a Semi-Dry blotter (BioRad, USA). Membranes were
incubated with 1/500 dilution of the anti-Pam antibody
for 90 min and with 1/5000 dilution of an anti-rabbit
alkaline phosphatase conjugated secondary antibody for
90 min Alkaline phosphatase reaction with NBT-BCIP
solution (Fluka, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was used for development. To detect production of Pam in vivo, larvae of
Galleria mellonella were injected with 20 μl of diluted
overnight cultures of either P. luminescens TT01 or P.
asymbiotica ATCC43949, corresponding to 200 CFU.
Infected insects were collected on successive days and
crushed in lysis buffer, containing 125 mM Tris pH 8.0, 4
M urea, 2% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol (1 ml per
insect). From each sample 10 μl were loaded for SDSPAGE and analyzed by Western blotting.
For the purification of recombinant Pam: The pellet of
1 liter of E. coli cells producing Pam was resuspended in
10 ml of buffer A (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl)
and lysed by sonication. The insoluble fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 4°C, 16 000× g, 20 min and the

Jones et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:141
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/141

resulting supernatant was diluted to 20 ml with buffer A.
This supernatant was loaded as 5 ml fractions onto a 5 ml
Hitrap QFF anion exchange chromatography column (GE
Healthcare, UK) equilibrated with: 3 × column volumes
(cv) buffer A, 3 × cv buffer B (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1 M
NaCl) and 3 × cv buffer A. Chromatography was performed on an ÄKTA purifier (GE Healthcare, UK). The
column was run at 0.8 ml min-1 with a 15 ml wash after
loading and a 5 × cv gradient from 5% to 100% buffer B to
elute the protein. 1 ml fractions were collected and 10 μl
samples were loaded for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The Hitrap QFF step was followed by further
anion exchange using a 1 ml MonoQ column (GE Healthcare, UK). Fractions containing Pam were diluted fourfold with buffer A and 4 ml were loaded after
equilibration of the column. Pam was eluted with a gradient of 5%-25% buffer B over 8 cv, and fractions containing
Pam were identified by SDS-PAGE. The estimated purity
of Pam was 95%.
Extracellular-polysaccharide (EPS) crude extraction

Cells grown on LB agar were harvested with a minimal
volume of 0.9% NaCl solution and EPS was detached by
mixing for 15-20 s in a blender. Cells were pelleted and
discarded, and 3 volumes of chilled acetone were added
to the EPS-containing supernatant (previously concentrated to 30-40 ml by freeze-drying). The mixture was
kept at -20°C overnight, centrifuged at 3 000 × g for 20
min and the pellet was dried and resuspended in a small
volume (10-20 ml H2O). This sample was ultra-centrifuged at 100 000 × g for 4 h to precipitate the lipopolysaccharide fraction. The supernatant was removed and
dialyzed overnight at 4°CC. Samples were frozen at -80°C
for 4-6 h, and freeze-dried to concentrate. EPS suspensions (2 mg/ml) from TT01rif and TT01pam were analysed by SDS-PAGE and Pam was detected by Western
blot. A suspension of TT01rif EPS (5 mg/ml) was incubated with 1.6% SDS or salt (0.5 M KCl) or vortex for 4
mins before performing electrophoresis on native gel and
Western blot.
Virulence, toxicity and symbiosis assays

For calculation of the LT50, or time taken for half of the
initial population to die, approx 100 cells from overnight
cultures of either TT01rif or TT01pam were injected per
insect and 100 G. mellonella larvae were used per treatment. LT50 is the calculated time after injection at which
50% of the larval population was dead; differences in LT50
times represent different rates of killing. Scoring of insect
death was carried out every 2 h between 44-52 h and 5968 h post-injection. Oral toxicity was assessed with a
standard feeding bioassay: 1 cm3 artificial wheat germ
food blocks were supplemented with 200 μl of supernatant from sonicated and pelleted E. coli cultures or Phos-

Page 11 of 13

phate Buffered Saline (PBS) as control. All supplements
were allowed to dry for 20 min under laminar flow. Two
first-instar Manduca sexta neonate larvae were placed on
each food block (12 larvae per treatment) and after 7 days
incubation at 25°C the weight of each caterpillar was
recorded. Tobacco hornworm M. sexta larvae were maintained on a wheat germ-based artificial diet [35] at 25°C
with a photoperiod of 17 h light: 7 h dark. G. mellonella
larvae were supplied by Livefood (UK).
For the assessment of symbiosis, infective juvenile (IJ)
H. bacteriophora were propagated on a lawn of either
TT01rif or TT01pam cells constitutively producing GFP.
The proportion of IJs transmitting GFP-labeled bacteria
was determined by fluorescence microscopy, as previously described [36].
Transmission electron microscopy and hemolymph
attachment assays

For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), bacterial
colonies grown on LB plates were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 2 h, washed in PBS and post-fixed in 1%
osmium tetroxide for 1 h. Samples were dehydrated in
acetone and embedded in Spurr's resin (TAAB, Premix).
Sections were cut with an ultra-microtome (Leica, Reichert Ultracut E) and stained with uranyl acetate and lead
citrate before examination with a JEOL JEM 1200 EXII
transmission electron microscope (JEOL Tokyo, Japan).
For labeling Pam at the ultra-structural level, samples
were dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in LR White
acrylic resin before sectioning and incubation with the
primary (anti-Pam) and secondary antibodies (goat antirabbit IgG conjugated with 10 nm gold particles).
For analysis of attachment in 5th instar M. sexta plasma
(filtered hemolymph), overnight cultures of TT01rif wildtype and TT01pam were diluted to 0.05 OD600 and incubated at 28°C for 8 h without agitation in 24-well tissue
culture plates on sterile circular glass coverslips. After 8 h
the planktonic bacteria were gently aspirated and the coverslips were washed 3 × with PBS. The coverslips were
fixed with 300 μl of 4% PBS-paraformaldehyde at 4°C for
24 h and stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI). Coverslips were mounted with Miowiol (Calbiochem) and analyzed with fluorescent microscopy (Nikon
Eclipse 90i, Japan). Cells count at 8 h was the average in
12 fields of vision at 60× magnification from triplicate
samples for the TT01rif and the same sample size for the
TT01pam mutant.
Physicochemical methods

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) data were acquired
using the Autolab ESPRIT (Eco Chemie, BV, The Netherlands). Measurements were made by following the variation in the reflected light minimum angle with time,
which is indicative of the change in optical properties of

Jones et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:141

the interface as bacteria attach. Glass disks with a thin
gold coating (50 nm thick) were placed on a hemispherical prism using index match fluid (RI = 1.518, Cargille),
which ensured optical continuity. 50 μl of PBS were
added and the system was allowed to stabilise for four
minutes before addition of 50 μl of bacteria washed with
PBS and adjusted to 6 × 108 CFU ml-1. The minimum
angle was thus recorded with time. Measurements were
made every three seconds for the duration of the experiment (until the SPR readings stabilized).
Purified Pam at 1 mg ml-1 concentration in 5 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 was used for circular dichroism (CD)
spectroscopy and thermal analysis (differential scanning
calorimetry, DSC). CD spectroscopy was performed by
Sharon Kelly at the Department of Chemistry, University
of Glasgow (UK). For CD in far-UV wavelengths, the
sample was diluted to 0.383 mg ml-1 and data were collected from a 0.02 cm pathlength cuvette. For CD spectroscopy in the near-UV range, a 0.5 cm pathlength
cuvette was used and Pam was diluted to 0.772 mg ml-1.
The CD spectra, obtained below 550 V, were analyzed
using the CDSSTR variable selection method at the
Dichroweb server [37,38]. Reference spectra set 3 [39],
covering wavelengths 240-185 nm, gave the most consistent results when the analysis was iterated. DSC was performed on a Microcal VP-DSC spectrometer at the
BBSRC Microcalorimetry Service (Department of Chemistry, University of Glasgow, UK).
