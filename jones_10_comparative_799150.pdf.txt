Comparative metagenomic analysis of plasmid
encoded functions in the human gut microbiome
Brian V Jones1*, Funing Sun2, Julian R Marchesi2,3

Abstract
Background: Little is known regarding the pool of mobile genetic elements associated with the human gut
microbiome. In this study we employed the culture independent TRACA system to isolate novel plasmids from the
human gut microbiota, and a comparative metagenomic analysis to investigate the distribution and relative
abundance of functions encoded by these plasmids in the human gut microbiome.
Results: Novel plasmids were acquired from the human gut microbiome, and homologous nucleotide sequences
with high identity (>90%) to two plasmids (pTRACA10 and pTRACA22) were identified in the multiple human gut
microbiomes analysed here. However, no homologous nucleotide sequences to these plasmids were identified in
the murine gut or environmental metagenomes. Functions encoded by the plasmids pTRACA10 and pTRACA22
were found to be more prevalent in the human gut microbiome when compared to microbial communities from
other environments. Among the most prevalent functions identified was a putative RelBE toxin-antitoxin (TA)
addiction module, and subsequent analysis revealed that this was most closely related to putative TA modules
from gut associated bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes. A broad phylogenetic distribution of RelE toxin genes
was observed in gut associated bacterial species (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria), but no
RelE homologues were identified in gut associated archaeal species. We also provide indirect evidence for the
horizontal transfer of these genes between bacterial species belonging to disparate phylogenetic divisions, namely
Gram negative Proteobacteria and Gram positive species from the Firmicutes division.
Conclusions: The application of a culture independent system to capture novel plasmids from the human gut
mobile metagenome, coupled with subsequent comparative metagenomic analysis, highlighted the unexpected
prevalence of plasmid encoded functions in the gut microbial ecosystem. In particular the increased relative
abundance and broad phylogenetic distribution was identified for a putative RelBE toxin/antitoxin addiction
module, a putative phosphohydrolase/phosphoesterase, and an ORF of unknown function. Our analysis also
indicates that some plasmids or plasmid families are present in the gut microbiomes of geographically isolated
human hosts with a broad global distribution (America, Japan and Europe), and are potentially unique to the
human gut microbiome. Further investigation of the plasmid population associated with the human gut is likely to
provide important insights into the development, functioning and evolution of the human gut microbiota.

Background
The human gut harbours a complex microbial ecosystem which may encode ~100 times as many genes as
the human genome and reaches a population density of
1013-1014 cells in the distal colon [1-5]. This ecosystem
is composed predominantly of bacteria belonging to the
Firmicutes (mainly Clostridia and Eubacteria), and Bacteroidetes (mainly Bacteroides) [2,6], and it is estimated

that the majority of species comprising this community
(~80%) remain uncultured [3,6]. Metagenomic studies
have begun to provide valuable insights into the metabolic activities undertaken by this community and the
impact of this microbial ecosystem on host physiology
and health [7-11].
Activities of the gut microbiota are the product of a
long co-evolutionary relationship between host and
microbe, which has resulted in a community that undertakes many functions beneficial to the human host [3,4].

(MGE) associated with the human gut microbiota (the
mobile metagenome) will also reflect the co-evolution of
host and microbe in this community, with functions
encoded by plasmids and other MGE shaped according
to key environmental stresses, and host-microbe interactions important to life in the human gut [12,13].
Characterisation of cultivatable members of the
human gut microbiota has highlighted the role of
mobile genetic elements (MGE) in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes in this community [14-23]. In particular, the spread of erythromycin resistance genes
among Bacteriodes sp. is well documented and attributed to mobilisation by conjugative transposons
[14-16,18]. Evidence also exists for horizontal gene
transfer (HGT) of tetracycline resistance genes in the
gut microbial community [17-22]. Furthermore, the
transfer of plasmids and transposons between diverse
and disparate members of the mammalian gut microbiota has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo
[17,23-25].
Genes involved in survival and persistence in the gastrointestinal tract, as well as activities that impact on
host-microbe or microbe-microbe interactions, are also
likely to be encoded by the gut mobile metagenome. As
such elucidation of the functions encoded by the MGE
associated with this community will be important in
defining key aspects of this ecosystem. In addition,
future attempts to manipulate this complex community
for the enhancement of human health will require the
genetic dissection of constituent species, for which plasmid vectors and other genetic tools are currently lacking. Exploitation of plasmids and other MGE populating
the gut ecosystem will provide the raw genetic material
for the development of such tools.
However, the large proportion of uncultivated species
comprising the human gut microbiota has impeded
study of this community, including the associated
mobile metagenome. Overall little is known about the
population of MGE that reside within this ecosystem,
the genes and pathways they encode, or their contribution to ecosystem maintenance and function. Owing to
the difficulty in accessing many members of this community, the application of culture-independent
approaches to study MGE are required to further study
this flexible gene pool. This has resulted in the development of metagenomic approaches aimed at investigating
a range of MGE, including bacteriophage, plasmids, and
integrons [13,26-28].
In this study we employed the culture independent
transposon aided capture (TRACA) system to isolate
novel plasmids from the human gut microbiota [13].
Subsequently a comparative metagenomic analysis was
undertaken to investigate the distribution of these plasmids among individual gut metagenomes, as well as the

relative abundance of plasmid encoded functions in the
human gut microbiome.

Results
Plasmid annotation and prediction of encoded functions

Plasmids were acquired from the gut microbiome of a
healthy volunteer using the TRACA system as previously described [13]. The complete nucleotide
sequences of four plasmids designated pTRACA18,
pTRACA20, pTRACA22 and pTRACA30 were obtained
and annotated. These plasmids ranged from 3.78 kb to
10.827 kb in size with G+C contents of 48.77% to 60.5%
(Fig 1).
Genes assigned putative functions in replication and
mobilization were identified on all plasmids along with
open reading frames (ORFs) of unknown function, many
of which exhibited no significant homology to sequences
present in the databases (Fig 1, Table S1 in additional
file 1). This result indicates that a large number of
uncharacterized activities, which may be relevant to ecosystem function, are encoded by plasmids in the gut
community. For plasmids pTRACA18 and pTRACA20
the only functions encoded by these plasmids that could
be assigned a putative function were those related to
plasmid replication and mobilisation. However, further
study is required to confirm the functional assignments
of the genes encoded by these plasmids.
In the case of pTRACA22 and pTRACA30, ORFs predicted to encode systems involved in segregational stability and site specific integration or recombination were
also identified (Fig 1, Table S1). Plasmid pTRACA30
was predicted to encode a putative ParA type ATPase
(ORF30-1) with high identity to the ParA plasmid segregation protein from Lawsonia intracellularis Plasmid 2
(Accession number: NC_008013; Table S1), as well as a
tyrosine site specific integrase (ORF30-5) belonging to
the Int family of recombinases (Table S1). This integrase
may mediate site specific recombination either within
the same molecule of DNA or between distinct molecules of DNA [29]. As such, ORF30-5 may be involved
in the resolution of plasmid dimers (which also
enhances plasmid stability) [29], or mediate the site specific integration of pTRACA30 into the chromosome of
the host bacterium. The presence of a putative excisionase on pTRACA30 (ORF30-8) strengthens this integration hypothesis.
Plasmid pTRACA22 was also predicted to encode
genes involved in plasmid stabilization and a RelBE
toxin/anti-toxin (TA) addiction module was identified
(ORF22-6 and ORF22-7, Fig 1, Table S1). In addition, a
putative entericidin toxin was also identified in this plasmid (ORF22-3) but no corresponding antitoxin was
detected (Table S1). ORFs encoded by plasmid
pTRACA22 exhibited a striking homology to sequences

from the draft genome of Blautia hydrogenotrophica
DSM 10507 (A member of the Firmicutes division isolated from human faeces). All pTRACA22 ORFS were
found to be between 98-100% identical at the amino
acid level to ORFs from B. hydrogenotrophica (Table 1).
Homologous ORFs identified in B. hydrogenotrophica
appeared to be contiguous based on gene locus identifiers (RUMHYD_1660, and RUMHYD_1665 to 1671;
Table S1), however it is unclear at present if these correspond to a plasmid present in B. hydrogenotrophica as
a finished genome sequence for this organism is currently unavailable.
Comparative metagenomic analysis of plasmids and
encoded functions

The presence of these plasmids, and the relative abundance of their encoded functions in the human gut
microbiome was investigated using metagenomic data

sets derived from fifteen human gut microbiomes, the
Sargasso Sea, soil, and the combined gut metagenomes of
lean and obese mice [9-11,30,31]. Initially metagenomes
were searched for nucleotide sequences homologous to
newly characterised plasmids (pTRACA18, pTRACA20,
pTRACA22, and pTRACA30), as well as two previously
characterised plasmids (pTRACA10, and pTRACA17,
[GenBank: AM263036, AM263037]) isolated from the
same individual also using the TRACA system [13].
No significant hits were found for pTRACA17,
pTRACA20, or pTRACA30 in any of the metagenomes
examined, and only limited homology to pTRACA18
was observed in one human gut metagenome (Table 1).
In contrast, for plasmids pTRACA22 and pTRACA10
nucleotide sequences with high identity to regions of
these plasmids were detected in multiple human gut
metagenomes which included both American and

Human gut [910], murine gut [11], marine and soil [3031] metagenomes were searched for sequences homologous to plasmid recovered from the human gut
using Blastn. No significant homology was found for any plasmid in the non-human metagenomes. For plasmids pTRACA10, 18 and 22 homologous sequences
were identified in human gut metagenomes. 1) Homologous sequences identified in each human metagenome to plasmids. Accession numbers for individual

region 11 (bp 1-602 on pTRACA22).

Japanese individuals (Fig 2, Table 1). Searches of marine,
terrestrial, and murine gut metagenomes failed to identify any nucleotide sequences with significant homology
to any of the plasmids analysed (Table 1).
Nucleotide sequences with high identity to
pTRACA22 were detected in 9 of the 15 human gut
metagenomes examined. In total 81.9% of the
pTRACA22 nucleotide sequence was represented at 90%
identity or greater in the collective human gut metagenomes examined, while 95.9% was represented at 80%

identity or greater (Fig 2, Table 1). Nucleotide sequences
with high identity to pTRACA10 were identified in 3 of
the 15 human gut metagenomes searched, and these
sequences all related to a distinct region of the
pTRACA10 plasmid. This region encodes a putative
phosphohydrolase/phophoesterase belonging to
COG4186 (ORF10-3, Fig 2, Table 1), with high identity
to an ORF from the draft genome sequence of Collinsella aerofaciens ATCC25986 (COLAER_02400, 85%
identity, 5e-108).

Due to the detection of nucleotide sequences homologous to pTRACA10 and pTRACA22 among multiple
human gut microbiomes, the relative abundance of
functions encoded by these plasmids in the human gut
microbiome was assessed. This analysis revealed that
functions encoded by pTRACA10 and pTRACA22 are
more common in the human gut microbiome when
compared to the non-human metagenomic datasets analysed. Several of these ORFs were found to be significantly more prevalent in the combined human gut
metagenomes when compared to murine, marine and
soil metagenomes (Fig 3a-b). Of these the most highly
enriched functions were the pTRACA10 phosphoesterase/phosphohydrolase (ORF10-3) along with ORF10-2
(unknown function), and the pTRACA22 RelBE toxinantitoxin addiction module (ORF22-6 and ORF22-7;
Fig 3a).
Variation between individuals was explored using
searches of the 15 individual human gut metagenomes
to identify amino acid sequences homologous to plasmid
encoded ORFs. This revealed that ORF10-3, ORF22-6,
and ORF22-7 also appeared to be widely distributed
among the individual human gut metagenomes examined (Fig 3b). While the increased abundance of proteins
involved in functions such as DNA replication are
expected and in line with findings from other metagenomic studies [10], the significance of the increased prevalence observed for other plasmid encoded functions in
this ecosystem is unclear.
In particular the greater incidence of RelBE addiction
modules in the human gut microbiota was unexpected.
TA modules have previously been demonstrated to be
highly abundant in free living bacteria and archaea from
a wide range of habitats, and absent in obligate intracellular prokaryotes [32]. As such the high relative abundance of the identified RelBE TA modules in the human
gut microbiota compared to other metagenomic datasets
is surprising, and may indicate the development of a gut
associated RelBE sub type, rather than an absence of
RelBE genes in microbial populations from other
environments.
Alternatively, TA modules such as MazEF, ParDE, and
HigBA may be more prevalent in natural environments
with RelBE modules present at a lower abundance. To
test this hypothesis the relative abundance in human
gut, marine, terrestrial and murine metagenomes of TA
modules from other families was assessed and compared
to the pTRACA22 RelBE module (Fig 3c). No other TA
modules were found to be as prevalent in the human
gut microbiome as homologues of the pTRACA22
RelBE. The relative abundance of each module in nonhuman metagenomes were similar but generally lower
in human gut metagenomes (Fig 3c). However, the
MazF toxin component of MazEF modules appeared to

Page 6 of 17

be more prevalent in human gut metagenomes than the
corresponding antitoxin or other TA genes, and this
was also the case in the marine and murine metagenomes (Fig 3c).
Phylogenetic analysis of pTRACA22 and metagenomic
RelE sequences

To further explore the distribution of RelBE TA modules in the gut metagenome and the relationship
between the pTRACA22 RelBE module, homologous
TA modules from combined human gut metagenomes,
and those encoded on plasmids or bacterial chromosomes, a phylogenetic analysis using RelE toxin components was undertaken.
Human gut metagenomic nucleotide sequences were
retrieved and both relE and relB ORFs were identified
(Table S2 in additional file 2). The majority of metagenomic sequences were found to encode complete relBE
addiction modules exhibiting characteristic genetic
architecture, in which relB genes are encoded upstream
of and overlapping the start codon of the relE gene [32].
In the majority of sequences where a cognate relB was
not detected this could be attributed to truncation of
the sequence, or the presence of orphan toxin genes
(Table S1). However several sequences were identified
in which a suitable relB candidate ORF was detected up
stream of the identified relE gene, but lacked RelB conserved domains or significant homology to RelB proteins
(Table S2).
The resulting set of 55 full length RelE homologues
were initially affiliated with bacterial phylogenetic divisions based on the species identified in BlastP or tBlastn
searches of the nr dataset (see materials and methods
for details). The majority of RelE homologues identified
were found to exhibit highest identity to sequences from
bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes, (in particular the
genus Clostridium) and Proteobacteria (Fig 4). Firmicutes have been estimated to represent a significant proportion of the gut microbiota and co-dominate this
ecosystem with members of the Bacteroidetes division
[2,6,33]. As such the large proportion of human gut
metagenome derived RelE affiliated with this division is
not unexpected, however, in comparison few sequences
were affiliated with the Bacteroidetes division (Fig 4).
In contrast, Proteobacteria account for a relatively
minor proportion of the adult gut microbiota [2,6,33],
but may co-dominate with Actinobacteria in the infant
gut [10]. Interestingly the majority of gut metagenomic
RelE types assigned to this group exhibited high identity
to the Escherichia coli pARS3 plasmid (Fig 4). The
pARS3 plasmid was originally identified in a clinical isolate of E. coli designated ARS3, which was obtained
from the urine of an inpatient in a Japanese general hospital [34]. Subsequent characterisation revealed pARS3
to be a large (~115 kb) conjugative plasmid encoding a

novel 16S methyltransferase, that functions as a broad
spectrum amino glycoside resistance determinant [34].
Overall, 33 distinct full length putative RelE âtypesâ
(designated type#1 to type#33) were retrieved from combined human gut metagenomes (Table S2), and aligned
with the pTRACA22 RelE, and homologous plasmid and
chromosomally encoded sequences retrieved using standard BlastP and tBlastn searches of the nr dataset (see
materials and methods for details). Notably, searches of
the public databases encompassed by the nr dataset did
not identify any homologous sequences originating in
archaea, and specific searches of the genome sequences
of the gut associated archaeal species Methoanobrevibacter smithii and Methanosphaera stadmanae, also failed
to identify any homologues.

Alignments of RelE amino acid sequences revealed
conserved residues, and highlighted regions of similarity
as well as regions predominantly conserved among
metagenomic sequences (Fig 5). Overall metagenomic
sequences generally showed less divergence from the
pTRACA22 RelE than other sequences included in the
alignment, and the C terminus L and F residues
appeared completely conserved among these sequences
(Fig 5).

RelE sequences showed that the 33 distinct metagenomic RelE âtypesâ are associated with all major bacterial divisions in the human gut (Firmicutes,
Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes, Fig 6). The
pTRACA22 RelE was most closely related to sequences

from Blautia hydrogenotrophica DSM 10507 (RUMHYD_01668), but was also closely related to sequences
from human gut metagenomes (Type #1 and #2) and
the E. coli pARS3 plasmid (Fig 6, Table S2). The association of the E. coli pARS3 RelE with pTRACA22 and
other gut derived sequences in our phylogenetic analysis
(Fig 6), rather than sequences originating in E. coli (the
natural host of pARS3), other Gram negative enteric
species, or other plasmid encoded sequences, indicates
that this plasmid may be closely related to pTRACA22.
Furthermore, both chromosomally encoded and plasmid
encoded sequences originating in Gram negative enteric
genus such as Escherichia, Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia appeared distinct from both human gut metagenomic
sequences, and those derived from draft genomes of Gram
negative and Gram positive gut associated species (Fig 6).
In particular, plasmid encoded RelE were observed to
form a discrete clade, and were largely distinct from the
chromosomally encoded RelE represented in our dataset
(Fig 6). Similar observations have been noted previously
for the CcdAB TA system, where plasmid encoded and
chromosomally encoded toxins formed distinct clusters in
phylogenetic analyses [35]. While it is unclear whether the

Page 9 of 17

sequences obtained from human gut metagenomes are
encoded chromosomally or by plasmids, as chromosomal
DNA represents the vast majority of the metagenomic
datasets utilised it is most likely that chromosomally
encoded TA modules have been retrieved.
The E. coli pARS3 IS26 composite transposon is closely
related to pTRACA22

Due to the close association between the pTRACA22
and pARS3 RelE observed in our phylogenetic analysis,
the potential relationship between these plasmids was
further explored. Comparison of pTRACA22 and the
available pARS3 sequence (limited to a 3964 bp region
of the plasmid; [Genbank: AB261016]) using the Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT) revealed that pTRACA22
shares high identity with a region of pARS3 encoding a
9.1 Kb IS26 based composite transposon (IS26Tn).
Notably the regions of pTRACA22 encoding the plasmid
replication protein (ORF22-8) and the RelBE TA addiction module (ORF22-6, and ORF22-7) exhibited very
high identity to the available pARS3 IS26Tn region at
the nucleotide level, but no homology to other plasmids
from E. coli or closely related enteric organisms was
observed for the IS26Tn sequence (Fig 7).

As several of the pTRACA22 ORFs mapped to the
homologous region of pARS3 did not correspond to any
ORFs identified during the original characterisation of
this plasmid [34], or currently annotated in the Genbank
record, the available pARS3 sequence was re-annotated
for this study (Fig 7). This analysis identified several
additional ORFs with high identity to ORFs encoded by
pTRACA22, and revealed similar gene architecture
(Fig 7). Wachino et al. (2007) [34] also reported the presence of a mobilization protein in the pARS3 IS26Tn
designated orf8, which was truncated by the insertion of
an IS26 element. It is likely that this corresponds to the
pTRACA22 mobilisation protein ORF22-2, but as the
sequence data for these regions of the pARS3 IS26Tn
are not currently available, this hypothesis cannot be
confirmed.
In contrast to the pARS3 IS26Tn, pTRACA22 does
not encode the npmA aminoglycoside resistance gene or
the adjacent ABC transporter binding protein (orf6, and
orf7 in pARS3 respectively, as described by Wachino et
al. [34]) and the region of the pARS3 IS26Tn encoding
these shows no homology to pTRACA22. Furthermore,
no IS26 elements were detected in pTRACA22.
Overall the pARS3 IS26Tn appears to have originated
from a plasmid related to pTRACA22, and encodes
genes with high identity to those found in the draft genomes of gut associated Firmicutes, particularly B. hydrogenotrophica DSM 10507 (Fig 4, Fig 6). This also raises
the possibility that the novel aminoglycoside resistance
mechanism encoded by the pARS3 IS26Tn originated in

Page 11 of 17

the human gut microbiome. However, tBlastn searches
of the human gut datasets used for comparative metagenomic analysis [9,10] did not yield any significant hits to
the pARS3 npm A protein.

Discussion
In this study we have applied a metagenomic approach
to isolate and characterise novel plasmids from the
human gut microbiome. These plasmids ranged between
3.7 and 10.8 kb, and at present it is unclear if this size
range represents a limitation of the TRACA system
used to isolate them, a pre-dominance of smaller plasmids in the gut microbiome or a combination of these
factors [12]. The range of G+C contents of plasmids isolated corresponds with the overall range in genomic
G+C content observed among the major bacterial divisions comprising the human gut microbiota. The Actinobacteria constitute a major phylogenetic division
within the human gut comprising high G+C Gram positive species [2,6]. In contrast other major phylogenetic
groups, Firmicutes and Bacteriodetes, are comprised of
low G+C Gram-positives and Gram-negatives respectively [2,6]. As such plasmids of a high G+C content
(pTRACA10, pTRACA18) are likely to originate from
bacteria belonging to the Actinobacteria.
Of the six complete plasmid sequences utilised in this
study, no significant homology to pTRACA17,
pTRACA20 or pTRACA30 was identified in any of the
metagenome data sets examined. This may simply be
due to a low abundance of these plasmids in the human

Figure 7 Annotation of the available pARS3 IS26Tn sequence fragment and comparison with pTRACA22. The sequence fragment of the
E. coli plasmid pARS3 described by Wachino et al[34] was downloaded from GenBank [AB261016]. Due to the high identity of pTRACA22 ORFs
with regions of the pARS3 sequence observed during tBlastn searches, the currently available pARS3 sequence (limited to a 3964 bp region of
the 9.1 Kb IS26Tn) was analysed using Glimmer v3, and predicted ORFs annotated. All ORFs described by Wachino et al [34] were predicted
along with five ORFs not originally described or annotated in the GenBank record, * denotes ORFs in pARS3 annotated during this study.
Nucleotide sequences of pTRACA22 and pARS3 were compared using the Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT) and shaded areas between sequence
maps represent regions of high identity at the nucleotide level. Areas shaded pink range from 95-97% identity, and areas shaded orange
exhibited 89% identity. ORFs described previously by Wachino et al follow nomenclature used in that study [43], and the following functions
were originally assigned to these ORFs: Orf4 - putative replication protein, Orf5: hypothetical protein, Orf6 - NpmA aminoglycoside resistance
gene, Orf7 - putative ABC transporter substrate binding protein. ORFs are shown as arrows. Open arrows denote ORFs that do not have a
homologue in both sequences. Coloured arrows indicate ORFs with homologues present in both pTRACA22 and pARS3, and âpairedâ ORFs are
connected by dashed lines with colours representing % identity at the amino acid level: Red arrows indicate greater than 90% identity between
paired ORFs, Orange arrows indicate greater than 80% identity between paired ORFs. Jagged edges indicate truncated ORFs.

gut microbiota, the generally low coverage of bacterial
communities offered by current metagenomic data sets,
or may reflect intra-individual variation in plasmids
associated with the gut community. Alternatively, the
apparent absence of these or closely related plasmids in
the human gut metagenomes examined, may be attributed to a general incompatibility of plasmid DNA with
the standard metagenomic approach used to generate
many of the currently available datasets, which is
focused on acquisition and sequencing of bacterial genomic DNA [7,9-13,33,36,37].
In contrast sequences homologous to plasmids
pTRACA10 and pTRACA22 were identified in multiple
human gut metagenomes. In particular, pTRACA22
appeared well represented in the combined human gut
metagenomes analysed, and the absence of nucleotide
sequences homologous to this plasmid in the nonhuman datasets, coupled with its presence in human gut
datasets from geographically isolated individuals with a
broad global distribution, suggests that pTRACA22 may
be unique to the human gut microbiota. This has also
been observed for bacteriophage present in the human
gut community and recently Ebdon et al. (2007)
reported that bacteriophages isolated from human faecal
material were specific to the human gut, and absent in
the general environment, as well as faecal samples from
horses, sheep, pigs, cattle, rabbits and poultry [38].
Furthermore the general enrichment of certain MGE in
the human gut microbiome has also been reported in
recent metagenomic studies [10].
Investigation of the relative abundance of functions
encoded by pTRACA10 and pTRACA22 revealed that
several show a higher abundance in the human gut
microbiome (Fig 3a). In particular the increased prevalence of the pTRACA22 TA addiction module in the
human gut microbiome was unexpected, and the significance of this observation is currently unclear. TA modules have been shown to contribute to plasmid stability
and maintenance through a post segregational killing
mechanism, and consist of a stable toxin component
which is inactivated by an unstable antitoxin [29,32,39].
Loss of the plasmid from daughter cells ultimately
results in a loss of the antitoxin component and the killing of plasmid free cells [29,32,39]. In the case of the
RelBE system, RelE encodes an RNA interferase which
cleaves mRNA in a site specific manner at ribosomes,
blocking translation [40,41]. Plasmid encoded TA modules are also involved in plasmid-plasmid competition
[42], and plasmids harbouring a TA module have been
shown to outcompete counterparts from the same
incompatibility group lacking a TA module [42]. These
attributes of TA modules may facilitate the maintenance
of plasmids, or other DNA molecules harbouring them,
in the human gut microbiome, and contribute to the

Page 12 of 17

observed prevalence of RelBE modules in this ecosystem
(Fig 3). However, this explanation does not account for
the lower prevalence observed for non-human
metagenomes.
TA modules that are active and functional in surrogate cloning hosts may also generate bias in metagenomic libraries by enhancing stabilisation of constructs
(such as metagenomic clones) harbouring them. Any
such effects of TA modules could also account for the
increased prevalence of the pTRACA22 RelBE and
homologous modules in the human gut microbiome, as
well as the differences between the relative abundance
of toxin and antitoxin homologs (Fig 3). However, considering that orphan RelE toxin genes were identified on
sequences retrieved from human gut metagenomes, and
no increase in relative abundance was observed for the
other TA modules analysed in this study, this explanation seems unlikely (Table S2).
It is also possible that bias between the metagenomic
data sets due to variation in methods for construction of
metagenomic libraries, such as efficiency of DNA
extraction protocols, may account for the observed differences in prevalence of plasmid encoded functions
between human and non-human metagenomes. However, the data sets utilised in this study were generated
using comparable approaches, and in the case of the 15
human gut metagenomes utilised, which were generated
by 2 distinct research teams [9,10], no demarcation
between data sets from different groups was identified
during our analysis. This is despite the observed paucity
of sequences from Bacteriodes sp. in the metagenomes
generated by Gill et al. (2006) [9]. Furthermore, analysis
of other TA modules revealed a similar prevalence
among the all metagenomic data sets, with few significant differences between human and non-human data
sets (Fig 3c).
Plasmids and other MGE are also potentially involved
in the maintenance of ecosystem functions, and retention of genes within this community in the absence of
any selective pressure for the functions they encode.
Many plasmids are highly stable even when providing
no obvious survival advantage to the host cell, and
numerous explanations have been suggested for the
apparent stability of plasmids encoding traits such as
antibiotic or heavy metal resistance, in the absence of
direct selective pressure. These include the existence of
unidentified selective pressures acting directly on the
resistance or other genes encoded by a plasmid, or provision of a survival advantage sufficient to overcome the
metabolic burden imposed on plasmid carrying cells,
when selective pressure is removed [43,44].
However, TA modules may also constitute a mechanism by which plasmids and the genes they encode are
retained in the absence of direct selective pressure [12].

Jones et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:46
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/46

It has also been proposed that chromosomally encoded
TA modules may stabilise regions of adjacent DNA and
maintain their vertical transmission [32,45,46]. Thus
both plasmid and chromosomally encoded TA modules
may be important in maintaining functional stability of
microbial ecosystems such as the human gut
microbiome.
The wide distribution and high prevalence of chromosomally encoded TA modules in both bacteria and
archaea (particularly in free living species) has also lead
to the hypothesis that these systems are advantageous to
the host bacterium [32,47]. Since the majority of
sequence data in the metagenomic libraries utilised will
be derived from chromosomal DNA, most of the RelBE
TA modules identified in the human gut microbiomes
will be chromosomally encoded. Therefore it is also
plausible that the increased abundance of these TA
modules in the human gut microbiome is due to effects
on the fitness of the bacterial host. Interestingly, while
assessment of other TA modules did not reveal the prevalence observed for the pTRACA22 RelBE, the MazF
toxin, which also functions as a ribonuclease and blocks
translation by the same mechanism as RelE [32,41,48],
did exhibit an increased prevalence in the human gut
microbiome as well as other environments, albeit to a
lesser extent (Fig 3c). Diverse functions have been proposed for chromosomally encoded TA modules in bacteria and archaea, and it is possible that these functions
are also important in gut associated bacterial species.
RelBE and MazEF TA modules have been shown to
modulate gene expression, undertake quality control of
this process, and facilitate bacterial survival under nutrient
limiting conditions or other environmental stresses
[32,48,49]. The involvement of TA modules in gene
expression may also be relevant to adaptation of prokaryotes to new environments, and TA modules have been
implicated in the formation of persister cells which can
survive exposure to antimicrobials and other stresses that
are otherwise fatal [50]. It has also been proposed that
chromosomally encoded RelE and ParE toxins are
exploited as cellular regulators, and that the acquisition of
these elements through HGT mediates the rapid development of novel regulatory pathways which facilitates adaptation to new environments through modulation of gene
expression [47]. The formation of persister cells and the
development of new regulatory pathways via TA have
important implications for colonization of the gut, as well
as survival of bacterial cells in the external environment,
or during transmission to new hosts. However, the exact
function of RelBE TA modules in bacteria inhabiting the
human intestinal tract is currently unknown, and will
require further detailed study to elucidate.
Interestingly, no RelE sequences homologous to the
pTRACA22 RelE were identified in gut associated

Page 13 of 17

archaeal species. Since TA modules such as RelBE have
been observed as highly prevalent and widely distributed
in free living archaea, and were identified in bacterial
species from all major phylogenetic divisions in the gut
microbial community, the lack of sequences homologus
to the pTRACA22 RelE in dominant gut archaeal species (M. smithii and Ms. stadmanae) was surprising.
This may reflect differences in selective pressures
imposed on bacteria and archaea colonising the human
gut, or the adoption of alternate strategies to cope with
the same environmental stress. While the exact nature
and source of the observed difference between gut
archaea and bacteria remain unclear, the identification
of functions shared or distinct to each lineage will be
important in developing a full understanding of the gut
microbiota, and the contribution of constituent species
to the development and output of this community.
The putative RelBE TA addiction module identified on
pTRACA22 also has potential to impact on eukaryotic
cells present in the human gut through activity of the
RelE toxin component. While no eukaryotic homologues
of RelE have been identified, this toxin has been shown
to be active against both prokaryotic and eukaryotic
organisms. The RelE toxin is functional in eukaryotic
cells and has been shown to induce apoptosis in cultured human cell lines [51], inhibit the growth of yeast
[52], and to cleave eukaryotic mRNA in the A site of
eukaryotic ribosomes in a similar fashion to that
described in bacteria [53]. However, studies demonstrating the activity of RelE in eukaryotic cells are currently
limited to artificial expression of the toxin using a specialised vector [51,52]. As such further study is required
to identify the in vivo effect, if any, of RelE toxins on
eukaryotic cells, particularly in light of the increased
prevalence of this TA module in the gut human gut
microbiome.
As well as a wide distribution among human metagenomic data sets, pTRACA22 was also found to illuminate the transfer of genetic material between diverse
members of the gut microbiota (Fig 7). The high identity of pTRACA22 to the E. coli pARS3 IS26-like transposon, indicates that this region of pARS3 is derived
from a plasmid closely related to pTRACA22 (Fig 7),
raising several intriguing possibilities. In particular the
presence of the pTRACA22 putative replication protein
on the pARS3 IS26Tn may allow pARS3 to function as
a natural shuttle vector and replicate in disparate bacterial hosts. Considering the high identity of pTRACA22
encoded genes to B. hydrogenotrophica, this scenario
would likely encompass replication in both Gram -ve
and Gram +ve species. Furthermore, the presence of a
RelBE addiction module (with high identity to that
encoded by pTRACA22) in the pARS3 IS26Tn could
stabilise pARS3 during transition between bacterial

Jones et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:46
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/46

hosts, and provide this plasmid with a competitive
advantage over other related elements in the same
incompatibility group [29,35,39,42].
While the site of gene exchange that resulted in the
formation of the pARS3 IS26Tn cannot be determined
with complete certainty, several factors indicate the
human or mammalian GI tract: i) Both species involved
in the genetic exchange (E. coli and a gut associated
Firmicute sp.) naturally inhabit the human gut; ii) The
high oxygen sensitivity of many cultivated Firmicutes
comprising the gut microbiota points to an anaerobic
environment such as the human gut [54]; iii) The paucity of sequences homologous to pTRACA22 in the
non-human gut metagenomes analysed here. Overall the
high identity of pTRACA22 with the pARS3 IS26Tn
supports the hypothesis that the human gut is a potential hotspot for HGT between disparate bacterial species
[12,20,22,55], and highlights the potential for gene transfer from commensal organisms to clinically relevant
pathogenic speices.
In light of the observed prevalence of RelBE TA modules in the human gut microbiome, the reported functionality of the RelE toxins in eukaryotic cells, and the
potential role of this system in mediating bacterial survival in the gut environment, the RelBE module encoded
by pTRACA22 merits further investigation, and these
studies are currently underway in our laboratory.
Furthermore, continued analysis of the mobile metagenomes associated with microbial communities will be
important in understanding many aspects of microbial
community function and evolution. A greater knowledge
of the MGE associated with bacterial communities will
also facilitate the development of novel strategies and
tools to dissect and manipulate these complex
ecosystems.

Conclusions
In this study we demonstrate the application of a metagenomic approach to isolate and analyse plasmids resident in the human gut microbiota. The use of the
culture independent TRACA system to capture novel
plasmids from the human gut mobile metagenome,
coupled with subsequent comparative metagenomic analysis of complete plasmid nucleotide sequences have
highlighted the increased prevalence of unexpected
functions in the gut ecosystem, and provided new
insights into plasmids associated with the human gut
microbiome.
The existence of plasmids encoding functions prevalent in the gut microbiome demonstrates the mobility of
the relevant genes within this community, and considering the proposed role of HGT in the convergence and
expansion of enriched community gene sets [7,56], the
identification and characterisation of such plasmids will

Page 14 of 17

be important in understanding the development and
evolution of the human gut microbiome. Furthermore,
as plasmids and other MGE frequently encode genes
advantageous to survival in a particular environment,
the analysis of plasmid encoded genes from the human
gut mobile metagenome is likely to provide important
insights into challenges faced by microbes colonising the
human gut, and the mechanisms by which these are
overcome.

Methods
Preparation of metagenomic DNA

Plasmids were acquired from the gut microbiome of a
healthy 26 year old British male Caucasian volunteer, on
a typical western style diet. The subject had not recently
consumed probiotics, and had not received antibiotic
treatment for over 3 years prior to collection of faecal
samples. The protocol was approved by the Clinical
Research Ethics Committee of the Cork Teaching Hospitals, and written informed consent was obtained from
the subject for participation on the study and publication of data generated. Bacteria were harvested using a
Nycodenz (Axis-Shield, Italy) density centrifugation gradient and subsequently total metagenomic DNA was
extracted using the Genomix Cells & Tissues extraction
kit (Talent, Italy) according to manufacturerâs instructions. Approximately 1 Î¼g of metagenomic DNA was
treated with ATP-dependant Plasmid Safe DNase (Epicentre, USA) according to manufacturerâs instructions,
to remove sheared genomic DNA. Plasmid Safe digests
were incubated overnight at 37Â°C and subsequently
inactivated by heating at 70Â°C for 30 min followed by
chilling on ice, and were used in plasmid capture reactions without further processing.
Isolation of novel plasmids from the human gut mobile
metagenome

Plasmids were isolated from plasmid-safe treated metagenomic preparations using the culture independent
TRACA system as previously described [13]. TRACA
reactions were set up using the EZ-Tn5 OriV Kan2 element (Epicentre, USA). Each reaction was composed of
35 Î¼l plasmid-safe digested metagenomic DNA, 2 units
of transposase, 1 Ã EZ-Tn5 reaction buffer and brought
to a final volume of 50 Î¼l by addition of sterile deionised water. Reactions were incubated for 2 h at 37Â°C
and stopped by addition of 5 Î¼l EZ-Tn5 stop buffer and
heating at 70Â°C for 15 min. Reactions were subsequently
diluted by addition of 450 Î¼l sterile deionised water and
purified using 100 kDa molecular weight cut off columns (Millipore, USA) according to manufacturerâs
instructions. Reactions were ultimately reduced to 10 Î¼l,
and 5 Î¼l of this was used to transform E. coli EPI300
competent cells (Epicentre, USA) by electroporation (18
kV/cm, 200 Î© resistance, 25 Î¼F capacitance).

Jones et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:46

Transformants were selected using LB agar supplemented with 50 Î¼g/ml kanamycin.
Plasmid sequencing, annotation and sequence analysis

Plasmids pTRACA 20, 22 and 30 were sequenced by
GATC biotech AG (Germany) using a primer walking
strategy, while pTRACA18 was sequenced by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Centre (Cambridge, UK). Open
reading frames encoded by these plasmids were predicted using Glimmer 3 [57,58]. Their putative functions
assigned based on homologies to proteins and conserved
domains identified in BlastP, tBlastn, and rpsBlast
searches. For BlatsP and tBlastn searches the nr dataset
was utilised (which encompasses the following public
databases: All non-redundant GenBank, RefSeq proteins,
PDB, SwissProt, PIR, PRF) and all sequences assigned a
putative function generated hits with an e-value of 1e-02
or lower. For rps-Blast searches the NCBI Conserved
Domains Database (CDD) was searched (which is composed of NCBI annotated entries plus protein domain
models from Pfam, SMART, COG, PRK, TIGRFAM
databases) and hits used to assign putative functions
generated e-values of 1e-04 or lower. Plasmid sequences
were annotated using Artemis [59] and genetic maps
constructed using Vector NTI software [60]. The annotated sequences have been deposited in Genbank under
the following accession numbers: FN429765 - FN429568
(pTRACA18 to pTRACA30 respectively). Assessment of
similarity between pTRACA22 and the available pARS3
plasmid sequence was undertaken using the web version
of the Artemis Comparison Tool (WebACT), with the
user defined sequences facility [61].
Comparative metagenomic analysis

Our comparative metagenomic analysis utilised 15 human
gut metagenomes [9,10], the combined gut metagenomes
of lean and obese mice [11], as well as soil and marine
metagenomes [30,31]. Using these datasets three complimentary surveys were undertaken to investigate various
aspects of plasmid distribution and prevalence of encoded
functions: i) Detection of nucleotide sequences homologous to plasmids utilised in this study; ii) Investigation of
the relative abundance of functions encoded by
pTRACA10 and pTRACA22 between human and nonhuman metagenomes; iii) Investigation of the variation
between individual human gut metagenomes, with respect
to functions encoded by pTRACA10 and pTRACA22.
i) Initially the combined human gut metagenomes,
and all non-human metagenomes were searched using
Blastn to identify nucleotide sequences homologous to
plasmids analysed in this study (pTRACA10, 17, 18, 20,
22 and 30). Only sequences 100 bp or greater in length
with an identity of 80% or over and e-value of 1e-5 were
considered significant in these searches (Fig 2, Table 1).
ii) The relative abundance of plasmid encoded functions, and homologues of various TA modules, in

Page 15 of 17

human and non-human metagenomic datasets was
examined as previously described [7]. Metagenomes
were searched using tBlastn to identify amino acid
sequences homologous to plasmid encoded ORFs or TA
module genes (Fig 3a and 3c). Hits generating an e
value of 1e-5 or lower and with a length of 30aa or over
were used to calculate the hits/Mb for subject sequences
in each search (i.e. each plasmid encoded ORF or toxin/
antitoxin amino acid sequence) [7]. For assessment of
MazEF, ParDE and HigBA TA modules, amino acid
sequences originating from Escherichia coli
O157_H7_EDL933 [GenBank GI: 16445223] were used
to search metagenomic datasets, as this species encoded
all three modules and Proteobacteria are prevalent in all
three environments examined (mammalian gut, soil,
marine). The significance of the observed differences
between human and non-human metagenomes was
explored using the c2 distribution, and the approximate
significance at the 99% confidence interval determined
using Microsoft Excel.
iii) To assess the general distribution and variation in
plasmid encoded functions between individual human gut
metagenomes, the top hits (based on bitscore) to each
plasmid ORF from tBlastn searches of each individual gut
metagenome were retrieved, and the incidence as well as
% identity to the relevant plasmid encoded ORF was
recorded (Fig 3b). Only hits generating an e-value of 1e-5
or lower and with a length of 30aa or over were utilised.
RelE sequence acquisition and construction of
phylogenetic trees

Toxin components of RelBE modules were selected for
this analysis as orphan toxin genes have been reported
in a wide variety of bacteria [32]. To retrieve complete
RelE amino acid sequences from combined gut metagenomes, nucleotide sequences identified as encoding
relE genes were acquired from human gut metagenomes. ORFs homologous to both relE and relB genes
from pTRACA22 were identified using tBlastn, and
complete ORFS annotated using Artemis. For the construction of phylogenetic trees, sequences which contained errors or inappropriate stop codons were
removed from the data set, along with sequences that
lacked intact COG3041 conserved domains observed in
the pTRACA22 and other RelE sequences. In addition,
potentially truncated ORFs were also removed and identical sequences resolved to a single representative (Table
S2). The resulting 33 distinct RelE sequences were combined with sequences homologous to the pTRACA22
putative RelE retrieved using BlastP and tBlastn searches
of the public databases, and aligned using Clustal_W.
Subsequently unrooted phylogenetic trees were constructed with the neighbour-joining algorithm and p-distances model (1000 bootstrap replicates), using the
MEGA3 software package [62].
