Podospora anserina hnwd non-self recognition
gene family

Abstract
Background: Genes involved in non-self recognition and host defence are typically capable of rapid diversification and
exploit specialized genetic mechanism to that end. Fungi display a non-self recognition phenomenon termed
heterokaryon incompatibility that operates when cells of unlike genotype fuse and leads to the cell death of the fusion
cell. In the fungus Podospora anserina, three genes controlling this allorecognition process het-d, het-e and het-r are
paralogs belonging to the same hnwd gene family. HNWD proteins are STAND proteins (signal transduction NTPase
with multiple domains) that display a WD-repeat domain controlling recognition specificity. Based on genomic
sequence analysis of different P. anserina isolates, it was established that repeat regions of all members of the gene
family are extremely polymorphic and undergoing concerted evolution arguing for frequent recombination within
and between family members.
Results: Herein, we directly analyzed the genetic instability and diversification of this allorecognition gene family. We
have constituted a collection of 143 spontaneous mutants of the het-R (HNWD2) and het-E (hnwd5) genes with altered
recognition specificities. The vast majority of the mutants present rearrangements in the repeat arrays with deletions,
duplications and other modifications as well as creation of novel repeat unit variants.
Conclusions: We investigate the extreme genetic instability of these genes and provide a direct illustration of the
diversification strategy of this eukaryotic allorecognition gene family.
Background
All living organisms have developed processes to discriminate self from non-self. Non-self recognition is required
both in conspecific allorecognition (recognition of a different individual from the same species) or recognition of
pathogenic non-self. In eukaryotes non-self recognition
relies on the production of polymorphic proteins able to
react to a range of molecules. Typically, genes involved in
non-self recognition are among the most polymorphic
loci in eukaryotic genomes, a classical example being the
MHC/HLA loci in mammals [1]. Diversification of the
corresponding genes occurs despite the exceedingly low
overall mutation rate required to maintain genome integrity [2]. A challenge in evolutionary biology is to under* Correspondence: mathieu.paoletti@ibgc.cnrs.fr

stand the mechanisms explaining this high level of
polymorphism in non-self recognition genes. Clearly,
positive selection for beneficial variants participates in
the maintenance of polymorphism in non-self recognition genes, but in addition in a number of cases specific
molecular mechanisms that increase diversification (and
thus increase the panel of alleles on which selection can
act on) are also involved.
In filamentous fungi conspecific non-self recognition
happens in the heterokaryotic cell produced after the
somatic fusion by anastomosis of cells of unlike genotypes [3-5]. The vegetative incompatibility (VI) process
takes place when incompatible alleles of specific het loci
are co-expressed in the cytoplasm of the heterokaryon
and leads to a cell death reaction [6]. The biological function of VI and forces driving the evolution and maintenance of het genes remain unclear. VI is thought to
restrict transmission of deleterious cytoplasmic elements
such as viruses or abnormal mitochondria [7,8], and to

limit resource plundering by aggressive genotypes [9]. It
has also been proposed that genes controlling VI could in
fact be involved in pathogen recognition and that VI
could be a secondary consequence of the pathogendriven divergence in these genes [10,11]. In that hypothesis, VI would be analogous to a genetic incompatibility
phenomenon common in plants and known as hybrid
necrosis. In hybrid necrosis a post-zygotic incompatibility occurs in F1 hybrids between different isolates and
results from pathogen-driven divergence in genes with an
immune function [12,13].
So far het loci have been characterized in only two species, Podospora anserina and Neurospora crassa. In P.
anserina the het-d and het-e loci are involved in nonallelic incompatibility interactions with het-c (unrelated
to N. crassa het-c) [14] while the het-r locus is involved in
non-allelic incompatibility with het-v [15,16] (figure 1).
Analysis of the recently sequenced P. anserina genome

[17] revealed that het-d, het-e and het-r belong to the
hnwd gene family that includes 2 additional members
(hnwd1 and hnwd3). They are part of the larger nwd family that comprises five additional members [18]. hnwd
genes encode for proteins including a N-terminal HET
domain effector of cell death [19-21], a central NACHT
domain [22] binding GTP and essential for activity [23],
and a C-terminal WD repeat domain that varies in size
(number of repeats) and sequence between natural isolates and defines allele specificity [24,25] (Figure 1). The
five hnwd genes encode for proteins of the STAND class
thought to act as molecular switches with a closed inactive form and an open active form adopted upon binding
to an activating molecule [26,27]. The nwd genes display
the NACHT and WD domains but lack the HET domain.
The WD repeat domains of the P. anserina nwd genes
display very dynamic evolutionary features [18]. The WD
domain is constituted of a variable number of highly con-

served WD40 repeat units that are submitted to three
evolutionary forces: 1) a high mutation load due to the
high number of repeats and the possible action of RIP, a
mutagenic process targeting repeated sequences [28], 2)
concerted evolution resulting from WD40 unit sequence
exchanges between and within loci and leading to WD40
repeat unit sequence homogenization, 3) strong positive
diversifying selection acting on four positions encoding
for amino acids located at the protein-protein interaction
surface of the β propeller fold adopted by the WD repeat
domains [18]. The combination of these evolutionary
forces has the potential to constantly generate new
alleles. This dynamism does not make obvious sense in
the context of a role of these het genes restricted to VI. In
contrast, in the context of the hnwd genes encoding for
pathogen receptors contributing to an immune response
[29,30], rapidly generating new alleles would allow for the
surveillance of a wide range of pathogens.
It is well established that tandemly repeated sequences
are unstable and undergo repeat number expansions and
contractions. This repeat instability is at the origin of
numerous cancers and neurological and developmental
disorders in humans but in a number of cases this plasticity also appears advantageous as it can favour rapid
genome evolution and adaptation [31,32]. Repeat variation rates in micro and minisatellite loci can be 5-orders
of magnitude higher than rates of single-nucleotide substitution. Intragenic tandem repeat instability was for
instance found to allow rapid evolution of cell surface
antigens in fungi [33,34] but also of genes controlling
morphological features in domestic dogs [35]. Mechanisms for this instability have been extensively studied
and it turns out that any mechanism involving new DNA
synthesis such as replication, recombination and repair
can contribute to repeat rearrangements [32].
In the present paper, we took advantage of the genetic
tractability of non allelic VI systems of P. anserina to
directly analyze rearrangements in intragenic tandem
repeats in this eukaryotic non-self recognition gene family. We selected a collection of 143 loss of function specificity variants in two members of the hnwd family
spontaneously generated under vegetative growth conditions (figure 1), while in nature selection would maintain
alleles providing new recognition specificities. We then
analyzed the underlying molecular events that occurred.
We found that diversification of the WD-repeat domains
occurs through intragenic reshuffling in the repeat arrays.
Importantly, this reshuffling is accompanied by frequent
generation of novel repeat unit sequences. The consequences of this diversification in the context of non self
recognition in natural isolates will be discussed. This
study provides a direct illustration of the role of tandem
repeat instability in evolvability in the context of non-self
recognition.

Results
Mutational bias towards hnwd genes

In non-allelic incompatibility systems, incompatibility is
expressed upon cell fusion between incompatible strains
but also in the progeny of sexual crosses involving incompatible parental strains. Incompatible gene pairs (such as
het-R het-V or het-C het-E) can be associated in a single
haploid nucleus by appropriate genetic crosses, leading to
the production of so-called self incompatible (SI) strains
(Figure 1). It has long been described that spontaneous
mutants escaping cell death arise from SI strains [16]. The
vast majority of the mutations allowing escape from het-R
het-V or het-C het-E incompatibility occur in the het-R or
het-E genes respectively while inactivation of het-V and
het-C is rare. The underlying cause for this differential
"mutability" was not understood. We generated two collections of spontaneous mutants allowing escape from
het-R het-V or het-C het-E incompatibility, the different
steps of the process being presented figure 1 and in Materials and Methods. Basically het-R het-V and het-C het-E
SI strains were grown for 24 h in permissive conditions
suppressing the manifestations of VI before transfer to
non permissive conditions where the incompatibility
reaction proceeds. After 5 days, 299 spontaneous mutant
sectors recovering normal growth arose from which we
picked and analysed a single mutant per subculture to
generate the RV and CE spontaneous mutant collections.
The RV and CE collections include respectively 109 and
34 unique individuals.
Mutations allowing for suppression of incompatibility
could occur a priori in either one of the het genes composing the gene pair causing the incompatible interaction
of the SI strain (het-R het-V and het-C het-E), or in
extragenic suppressor which we did not observe. For each
collection, we identified the mutated het gene by confronting each mutant against both parents used to set up
the original cross. Incompatibility is characterized by the
formation of an abnormal contact zone between incompatible strains called the barrage [6]. For each gene pair,
the mutations were totally biased towards one of the two
het genes. All the mutants of the RV collection were
affected at the het-r locus and expressed an inactive het-r
allele. As well, all the mutants of the CE collection were
affected at the het-e locus and expressed an inactive het-e
allele. The combined 143 mutants from both collections
are affected in the het genes that belong to the hnwd gene
family suggesting a particular genetic instability at the
hnwd loci.
Repeat loss is the most common event for hnwd
inactivation

We set out to define the molecular events leading to inactivation of the hnwd genes. The presence of highly conserved tandemly repeated WD40 sequences both in the

het-E and het-R genes led us to investigate the status of
the repeat domains. The number of WD40 repeat units
present in the WD repeat domains of the mutated genes
(het-r or het-e) was estimated from the size of the PCR
amplicon generated using locus specific primers (additional file 1). The initial active het-R allele and the het-E1
allele used here both contain 11 WD40 repeats [15]. On
the basis of the number of repeats in the WD domain of
the mutants, we defined three classes of mutants, the
class of deletion mutants (dWD) that present a reduced
number of WD40 repeats compared to the wild type
alleles, the class of gain of repeat mutants (gWD) that
have a greater number of WD40 repeat units than the
wild type allele, and the class of mutants with the same
number of WD40 repeats as the initial active allele
(snWD). As revealed in figure 2, for both collections most
mutants belong to the dWD class as 87% (95/109) of the
RV mutants and 79% (27/34) of the CE mutants have less
than the original 11 WD40 repeats. In addition we found

10 snWD class and 4 gWD class mutants in the RV collection, and 3 snWD class and 4 gWD class mutants in the
CE collection. The proportion of dWD mutants was to be
expected as it was shown that a minimum of ten WD40
repeat units are required for VI to occur [24].
Mapping of the WD40 repeat deletions

Most mutants are thus generated through deletion of a
number of WD40 repeat sequences. Deletions of a small
number of WD40 repeats are more frequent than deletions of a large number of repeats (figure 2). We took
advantage of the presence of BglII restriction site polymorphism in the WD40 repeat sequences of the het-R
parental allele [15] to map the deletion events of the RV
deletion mutants collection (Figure 3). First we predicted
all possible patterns generated by BglII restriction of PCR
fragments amplified with primers A and B from genomic
DNA of the het-R wild type allele or all the deletion
mutants of the RV collection (additional file 2). Then,

assuming that only deletions of contiguous WD40
repeats occurred, we predicted the intervals in which
deletions could occur to generate the predicted BglII
restriction profiles (additional file 2). The fact that 88 out
of 95 mutants resulted in predicted BglII restriction profiles suggests that indeed deletions of a unique fragment
of contiguous WD40 repeat sequences is the most frequent event. The 7 mutants not producing predicted
BglII restriction profiles probably resulted from more
complex rearrangements. Finally for the 3 most frequent
subclasses of mutants as defined by the number of
deleted WD40 repeats, we compared the number of
occurrence of deletions in each interval to (E), the number of excepted deletions per interval if they occurred at
random along the sequence. E depends on the length of
the interval, the length of the WD repeat domain and the
number of mutants in the subclass (Figure. 3 and additional file 2). This analysis demonstrated that deletions

can involve any of the 11 repeats and that deletions occur
at random along the WD40 repeat domain. We could not
conduct the same analysis for the het-e mutants as BglII
sites were present in 10 of the 11 WD40 repeats.
Sequence of 25 mutant alleles

To characterize the molecular events leading to inactivation of the het-R or het-E alleles in the different classes,
we systematically sequenced the WD domains from the
21 individuals of the snWD and gWD classes of mutants
as well as 4 alleles of the dWD class selected randomly.
Five of the snWD mutants from the RV collection display
a WD repeat domain identical to wild-type but displayed
mutations outside of the WD-domain and will be
described in a further section.
The remaining 16 alleles were affected in the WDrepeat domain (figure 4). Overall we found 38 new WD40
repeat sequences as compared to the parental alleles.

Figure 4 Schematic representation of the gWD and snWD mutants. A/Parental active het-R allele and mutants from the RV collection. B/Parental
active het-E allele and mutants from the CE collection. Nucleic sequence WD40 repeat units sharing the same colour are identical. Repeat units represented in white differ by a single nucleotide from their parental repeat unit (indicated by a number). Repeat units represented in black differ by more
than one nucleotide from any parental units. Stop codons are indicated by arrowheads. Incomplete boxes of the e2 mutant delineate a 21 bp in frame
deletion.

First mutations in the WD repeat domain all preserved
the reading frame. In the simplest situation mutant alleles
differed from wild type by a single point mutation in one
of the WD-repeat units as exemplified by the r1 and r2
alleles mutated in repeat unit 7 and 2 respectively. Then,
in the sequenced dWD alleles, a single deletion step led to
the removal of 2, 3 or 4 contiguous repeat units in the r10,
r11, e8 or e9 deletion mutants. Duplication of one or several repeat units is also observed like duplication of
repeat unit 2 in the e4 allele. Complex rearrangements
occurred in several alleles with concomitant duplication,
replacement and deletion events that imply multiple steps
as exemplified by allele r9 which displays a total of 14
repeat units.
Repeat rearrangements are intragenic

One of the striking features of the mutant allele
sequences is that in the vast majority of the alleles, one
finds new WD repeat units. We found 16 repeat units
that differ from a parental unit by a single mutation and

22 repeat units that differ from the parental units by more
than a single point mutation (figure 4). We observed 12
such new WD40 repeat unit sequences in the RV mutant
collection and 10 in the CE mutant collection (figure 4).
To define the origin of these 22 sequences, and because
the WD40 repeat sequences of the hnwd gene family are
undergoing concerted evolution and can thus occasionally be exchanged between loci, we sequenced the WD
domain of all the family members from both parental
strains used to produce the het-R het-V and het-C het-E
SI strains. This lead to the identification of 41 new WD40
repeat units in addition to the 69 units already found in
the sequenced genome [36]. A high level of polymorphism is evident at the nwd loci between the two parental
strains, both in terms of number of WD40 repeat units
present at each locus and in terms of WD40 repeat unit
sequences (additional file 3). As these strains are nearly
isogenic [37], the observed polymorphism could reflect
polymorphism existing in the natural isolates from which

Chevanne et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:134
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/134

they are derived. Alternatively, this polymorphism could
be the result of unselected concerted evolution occurring
during crosses realised in laboratory conditions over the
years as observed for rDNA loci in Drosophila melanogaster [38] or Daphnia obtus [39]. A phylogenetic tree
was then constructed with the nucleotide sequences of
the 157 WD40 repeat units from the wild-type alleles and
including the 29 new WD40 repeat units identified in the
mutant het-r and het-e alleles (additional file 4) that
revealed a topology consistent with what we previously
observed [18]. The WD40 repeat units tend to cluster by
gene of origin with a strong bootstrap support. This indicates that intragenic events leading to sequence homogenization of WD40 repeat sequences are more frequent
than intergenic exchanges. Significantly, all the newly
identified WD40 repeat sequences found in the het-r
mutant alleles cluster with the wild-type WD40 repeat
sequences from the het-R allele. Similarly, all newly identified WD40 repeat sequences at the het-e locus cluster
with the WD40 repeat sequences from the parental het-E
allele. We also analyzed the WD-repeat number of all
nwd gene family members in all mutant strains. None of
the other nwd genes showed any variation in repeat unit
number in the mutants, consistent with the conclusion
that rearrangements occurred at the intragenic level only
(data not shown).
From these observations, we conclude that although
intergenic WD40 repeat unit exchanges between nwd loci
apparently occur in the wild [18], in our experiment the
new WD40 repeat sequences have been generated
through intragenic events only.
Rearrangements generate multiple novel repeat unit
sequences

As mentioned above in most of the mutant alleles one or
several repeat units with novel sequences are found. One
can attempt to recapitulate the events that led to the genesis of such novel repeat units. The simplest situation is
probably the one that occurred in the alleles of the dWD
class. Mutants r10 and r11 of the RV collection were
deleted of 2 or 4 WD40 repeat units respectively. The
deletion event resulted from fusions between repeats 5
and 7 and between repeats 5 and 9 of the wild-type allele
in mutants r10 and r11 respectively. This fusion event
generates new WD40 repeat units sequences. The same
was true for the two dWD mutants of the CE collection
(e8 and e9). Again we found that in both cases a single
fragment was deleted and resulted in new chimeric
WD40 repeat sequences (additional file 5).
In mutant r4 allele, 7 point mutations clustered in 88 bp
are observed in the 2nd repeat of the domain. This stretch
of 88 nucleotides appears almost identical to the corresponding region of the 4th WD40 repeat sequence of the
wild type allele and differs by only two positions located

Page 7 of 12

at the end of this region (additional file 6). This cluster of
mutations could thus be the result of gene conversion of
this short region in the mutant WD40 repeat sequence by
the wild type sequence of the 4th WD40 repeat unit.
A simple case of unequal crossing over could explain
the genesis of the mutant allele e6. This mutant has
gained a WD40 repeat unit e6-3 whose sequence is new.
Comparison of the WD40 unit sequences reveals that this
new repeat could correspond to a fusion between the 5'
end of the third repeat and the 3'end of the second repeat
of the wild type allele. The break point could have
occurred at the adenine nucleotide at position 49 that is
unique amongst the WD repeats (additional file 7).
We have previously shown that two pairs of codons
(pairs of codons 7, 9 and 25, 27) in each repeat unit are
under positive selection. Based on homology modelling,
the corresponding amino acids all group at surface loops
at the top of the β-propeller structure at the interaction
surface [18]. The amino acid combination at those four
positions thus presumably defines the functional binding
properties of the repeat unit. In the 41 new WD40 repeat
units we identified in the whole of the nwd gene family,
23 displayed new amino acids and associations of amino
acids at these four positions that had not been described
in the genome sequence (additional file 8). More significantly, among the 38 new WD40 repeat units generated
through mutations of the het-E or het-R alleles, twelve
display novel amino acid combinations at those 4 critical
positions that were not found in the repeat units of the
parental alleles (table 1). Nine of these new combinations
apparently arose by shuffling parental pairs of codons.
However three mutant WD40 sequences most likely generated by point mutations lead to pairs of codons absent
from the parental sequence. This observation strongly
suggests that repeats with novel functional properties can
indeed be generated through these rearrangement events
as demonstrated in vitro for TPR or LRR containing
repeat units [40,41].
Point mutations outside of the WD-repeat domain

Five of the snWD mutants from the RV collection display
a WD repeat domain identical to the wild type repeat
domain. We then sequenced the remaining of these
mutant genes after PCR amplification with primers C and
D (additional file 1). After comparisons with the wild type
allele we identified one nucleotide insertion in mutants
E5 and M8 and a one nucleotide deletion in mutant A1
that lead to frame shifts and premature stop codons
(additional file 9). In the J4 mutant we identified a T66G
substitution that results in an I22 M mutation (additional
file 9). Interestingly this position belongs to the first of
three conserved blocks forming the HET domain as
defined earlier [19] and responsible for the induction of
the cell death reaction [21]. In the M12 mutant a T1702A

The four amino acids at positions under selection in newly generated alleles (underlined) are amino acids found in the parental sequences
(white boxes) for A/the het-E gene, and B/the het-R gene. Bolded pairs of amino acids were generated in the mutants. Repeats are named after
their positions in the mutated alleles, the class of the corresponding mutant is indicated in brackets.

substitution leads to a Y568N mutation (additional file 9).
This position is located between the conserved block V
and VI of the NACHT domain [22] that is present in
many different proteins of the STAND class [26]. The
NACHT domain activity is essential to the incompatibility reaction [23].

Discussion
We have selected for mutations in two members of the
hnwd gene family that suppress self-incompatibility. In
other words the incompatible genetic interaction
between the HNWD genes and their antagonist het-C or
het-V genes has been lost through mutation of the
HNWD partner. The vast majority of mutants were
altered in their WD repeat domain involved in recognition specificity. The WD repeat domain adopts a doughnut shaped β propeller fold that forms a protein-protein
interaction surface at its top [42]. A typical β propeller
fold associates seven WD40 repeats, although such structures containing between 4 to 8 repeats have been

described [43,44]. Proteins including larger number of
WD40 repeat units have been described, and for example
the thirteen WD40 repeat units of APAF-1 forms two distinct β propeller structures of six and seven repeat units
[45,46]. As we do not know how the WD repeat units of
the HNWD proteins assemble, the reasons for the loss of
activity in the mutants can only be speculated, but it is
reasonable to suspect that loss of the genetic incompatibility in the mutants results from alterations of the physical interaction between the WD repeat domain of HET-R
or HET-E proteins with their antagonist partner HET-V
or HET-C. Most mutations correspond to deletions of
WD40 repeat units. Large deletions leading to WD repeat
domains encoding for less than 6-7 WD repeat units are
unlikely to associate into a functional β propeller thereby
producing an inactive protein. In contrast small deletion
mutants, snWD mutants and gWD mutants retain a
number of repeats sufficient to generate a β-propeller
fold. This suggests that the mutations specifically affect
the binding affinity of the WD domain for the antagonist

Chevanne et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:134
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/134

partner after the rearrangement of the amino acids
located at the protein-protein interaction surface. The
fact that in the RV collection repeat deletions that inactivate het-R occur all along the sequence of the repeat
domain suggests that all the WD40 repeat units contribute to binding of the antagonist partner.
We obtained a total of 299 spontaneous mutants sectors starting from 153 colonies. All the mutants analysed
are affected in the hnwd gene involved in the system. We
found no mutants affected in the het-C or het-V genes, or
in extragenic suppressors. Also interestingly in a similar
screen for mutants escaping from VI cell death with a
genetically engineered het-s/het-S SI strain, Coustou and
co-authors obtained only 17 mutants from 500 starting
colonies after mutagenic treatment [47]. This difference
in the mutant screening yields highlights the instability of
the hnwd genes as opposed to the repeat-free het-s, het-S
genes, het-c or modA genes [48]. In that respect it is relevant to note that the het-E allele we used here displays an
additional WD40 repeat unit compared to the allele originally described [25] while both recognize the same hetC1 allele. This difference is the likely consequence of
genetic modification that occurred during subcultures in
laboratory conditions.
A remarkable consequence of the instability of the WD
repeat domain is that it contributes to the diversification
of the WD40 repeat repertoire. Not only are repeat arrays
reshuffled and specific repeats duplicated or deleted but
numerous novel repeat unit sequences were generated in
the process. In the subset of mutants we analysed we
found a total of 38 new WD40 repeat units. More significantly, we found 12 new combinations of the four positions of the WD40 repeat unit located at the top of the βpropeller structure and thought to be crucial for recognition of the antagonistic partner [18]. We used here an
experimental set up starting from a SI strain grown under
permissive conditions and transferred to non permissive
conditions to select for loss of function mutations as a
consequence of the plasticity of the WD repeat domain of
the hnwd gene family (figure 1). The genetic plasticity
unveiled here might provide an explanation for a remarkable result obtained in early genetic studies on incompatibility interaction in P. anserina. Delettre and Bernet [49]
have shown that using an ad hoc screen several additional
non-allelic incompatibility loci could be genetically
selected in laboratory conditions. The incompatibility
interactions selected in that manner shared a number of
features with the het-C/het-E and het-R/het-V interactions, for instance they could be alleviated by the suppressor mutations that suppress het-C/het-E and het-R/
het-V incompatibility. These new het loci also appeared to
be genetically unstable. Based on the results presented
herein, a plausible explanation for this result is that rearrangements in repeat arrays of hnwd genes generated

Page 9 of 12

novel binding specificities leading to recognition of a self
determinant creating a genetic incompatibility de novo.
Similarly, in nature, from the pool of WD40 repeats
arrangements produced in the mycelium under vegetative growth conditions, selection will fish out combinations providing novel advantageous recognition
specificities. It is relevant to note that het-c, the antagonistic locus of het-d and het-e in VI, also displays signs of
fast evolution [29] suggesting a co-evolution with the
hnwd genes, thus new binding specificities might also be
generated through evolution of het-c.
In biotechnological applications, it has been demonstrated in vitro that random association of different
ankyrin repeat units can produce engineered ankyrin
domains with binding affinity for selected targets [40,41],
the same is true for designed LRR- and tetratricopeptiderepeat proteins. The combinatorial reshuffling and individual repeat generation process unveiled here suggest
that the WD40 domains of nwd genes might allow generation of a virtually unlimited binding repertoire. The generation of extensive binding repertoires by combinatorial
association of variable intragenic tandem repeats is a
strategy that is also encountered in other eukaryotic nonself recognition molecules in plants and animals. In
plants recognition of pathogens is ensured by members of
the NBS-LRR genes encoding for a NBS nucleotide binding site and a Leucine Rich Repeat domain. The LRR
domain is thought to contribute to pathogen recognition
[50,51]. Some LRR genes are submitted to positive diversifying selection, concerted evolution and recombination
between and within loci [52,53]. Evolution of the NBSLRR genes appears enhanced in presence of the pathogen
as presence of pathogen attack induces the Systemic
Acquired Recombination [54] preferentially in the NBS
LRR encoding genes [55]. Similarly, in jawless vertebrates
antigen recognition by lymphocyte receptors relies on the
combinatorial assembly of LRR gene segments [56]. It has
been proposed that somatic recombination in the variable LRR-units has the potential to generate a repertoire
of 1014 different lymphocyte receptors. It appears that
diversification of the fungal hnwd non-self recognition
genes follows similar principles including diversification
and combinatorial shuffling of repeated units forming a
recognition plateform. The estimated WD-domain repertoire is colossal (>1012) even if one only considers the 54
different repeat units identified in the sequenced genome
as the building blocks for a 7 repeat WD-domain repertoire. This likely represents an underestimation since
additional repeat unit variants were found in a different
isolate and novel repeat units can be generated through
repeat instability. In addition, the β-propeller structures
might be made of more than 7 repeats as exemplified by
the 11 repeat WD-domains of wild-type het-e and hetv[48].

Chevanne et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:134
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/134

In the two examples cited above, the plant NBS-LRR
genes and the sea lamprey lymphocyte receptors, the
repeat proteins are involved in pathogen-detection and
the extraordinary binding versatility of these proteins is
related to the diversity of the pathogen associated patterns that are recognized. Now how should the evolvability of the hnwd genes be understand? The possibility to
generate such a vast variety of binding specificities does
not make obvious sense in the context of vegetative
incompatibility especially considering that in N. crassa,
incompatibility alleles are very stable, in finite number
(two or three alleles) and evolutionarily very ancient. The
evolvability of the hnwd genes along with other features
of the VI reaction recently lead us to suggest that the
hnwd genes might be components of a fungal innate
immune system with the function in response to pathogenic non-self [11]. In this context, as in the two examples
mentioned above in plants and jawless vertebrates, the
ability to produce a wide range of non-self recognition
molecules would allow for the detection of a wide range
of pathogens and counteract their immune-avoidance
strategies. It is interesting to note that in some cases cell
surface antigen in pathogens rely on tandem repeat instability for rapid adaptation so it appears that similar weapons are use by host and pathogens in their ongoing arms
race.

Conclusions
The causes and the consequences of genetic incompatibilities currently raise a keen interest among evolutionary
biologist because of their role in speciation processes
[12,57-59]. Fungal incompatibility provides a genetically
well defined example of such a genetic incompatibility.
hnwd genes based non-allelic incompatibility in P. anserina leads to various degrees of pre and post-zygotic isolation [60]. The present study documenting the genetic
instability and plasticity of the hnwd genes as well as the
hybrid necrosis phenomenon caused by NBS-LRR genes
in A. thaliana [12,13] illustrate that particular evolutionary regimens promoting extensive and rapid variation
among isolates of the same species can favour the arising
of genetic incompatibilities.
Methods
Strains, incompatibility relationships and selection of
mutants

Conditions and media used for P. anserina have been
reviewed recently [61]. The reference P. anserina isolate
called s harbours the het-r, het-V, het-c2 and het-e4 alleles
at the het-r, het-v, het-c and het-e loci and is nearly
isogenic to all other strains used in this work [37].
Because these loci are involved in non allelic incompatibility, it is possible to recover self incompatible (SI)
strains in the progeny of appropriate crosses. SI strains

Page 10 of 12

display a clear phenotype characterised by a growth
arrest soon after spore germination and a generalized cell
death reaction. A cross between the s strain and a strain
bearing the het-R and het-V1 alleles at the het-r and het-v
loci will produce SI het-R het-V F1 progeny. As incompatibility between het-R and het-V alleles is thermosensitive,
these SI strains can grow as wild type at 32°C, while
transfer to 26°C triggers the incompatibility reaction [16].
A cross between the s strain and a strain bearing a single
incompatible allele at the het-e locus (het-Ea) produce a
het-C het-E SI strain. Incompatibility in these SI strains is
partially suppressed by the addition of 6 g/l of dihydrostreptomycin in the culture medium [62]. We selected
and grew het-R het-V or het-C2 het-E SI strains in permissive conditions (32°C or dihydrostreptomycin containing medium) for 24 h until the mycelia reached 1 cm
in diameter, before transfer to non permissive conditions
(26°C or dihydrostreptomycin free medium). After 5 days
of incubation we observed spontaneous mutant sectors
arising. We collected a single mutant sector per starting
colony to avoid analysing several times the same mutant.
Vegetative incompatibility was assessed by barrage testing and sexual compatibility was assessed by spermatization as previously described [15].
Nucleic acid manipulation and nomenclature

Routine genomic DNA extractions were performed as
described by [63], or using the Plant DNA extraction kit
(Qiagen) when high quality DNA was necessary. PCR
were performed using the Long Range Template Taq
polymerase (Roche), according to the manufacturer recommendations. Time for DNA extension was adjusted
according to the length of the fragment to amplify. The
oligonucleotides used, as well as their location in the various loci analysed are listed in additional file 1. PCR products were gel purified and cloned in the XL TOPO
cloning vector (Invitrogen). Sequencing was performed
by the Genome express company. We systematically
sequenced cloned WD40 sequences from at least two
independent PCR reactions. Accession numbers are
listed in additional file 10. Nucleic acids and protein
sequences were analysed with the program MEGA3 [64].
PCR fragments were column purified (Qiagen Minelute
kit) before restriction with BglII (Biolabs).
Gene and loci names are italicized while protein names
are not. Active alleles are indicated with capitals while
inactive alleles and loci are indicated with lower cases.
