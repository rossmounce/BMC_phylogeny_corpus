Abstract
Background: Viruses that have spent most of their evolutionary time associated with a single host
lineage should have sequences that reflect codivergence of virus and host. Several examples for
RNA viruses of host-virus tree congruence are being challenged. DNA viruses, such as
mastreviruses, are more likely than RNA viruses to have maintained a record of host lineage
association.
Results: The full genomes of 28 isolates of Wheat dwarf virus (WDV), a member of the Mastrevirus
genus, from different regions of China were sequenced. The analysis of these 28 entire genomes
and 18 entire genome sequences of cereal mastreviruses from other countries support the
designation of wheat, barley and oat mastrevirus isolates as separate species. They revealed that
relative divergence times for the viruses WDV, Barley dwarf virus (BDV), Oat dwarf virus (ODV)
and Maize streak virus (MSV) are proportional to divergence times of their hosts, suggesting
codivergence. Considerable diversity among Chinese isolates was found and was concentrated in
hot spots in the Rep A, SIR, LIR, and intron regions in WDV genomes. Two probable
recombination events were detected in Chinese WDV isolates. Analysis including further
Mastrevirus genomes concentrated on coding regions to avoid difficulties due to recombination and
hyperdiversity. The analysis demonstrated congruence of trees in two branches of the genus, but
not in the third. Assuming codivergence, an evolutionary rate of 10-8 substitutions per site per year
was calculated. The low rate implies stronger constraints against change than are obtained by other
methods of estimating the rate.
Conclusion: We report tests of the hypothesis that mastreviruses have codiverged with their
monocotyledonous hosts over 50 million years of evolution. The tests support the hypothesis for
WDV, BDV and ODV, but not for MSV and other African streak viruses.

Background
Viruses are a class of genetic elements dependent on suitable host cells for their propagation. Viruses belonging to

diverse viral groups have been proposed to have codiverged with their hosts based on congruence of phylogenetic trees for the viruses with those for their hosts. In

codivergence, congruence results from long association of
the viral and host lineages. The term codivergence is preferred to describe this situation since, unlike the term
"coevolution", it does not imply that the association necessarily provides mutual benefits to the partners [1].
The best studied examples of codivergence [2] include the
hantaviruses [3] and arenaviruses [4,5] in their murid
hosts, and potyviruses [6] and tobamoviruses [7,8] in
plant hosts. Three of these examples have recently been
challenged. A reanalysis of hantaviruses, including data
on shrew hantaviruses, has called the codivergence of
hantaviruses with hosts into question [9]. The role of
recombination in generating arenavirus phylogenetic
trees is under dispute [10]. A recent reanalysis of Potyvirus
divergence suggested that this genus emerged shortly after
the beginning of agriculture [11], much later than was earlier proposed. The recent analysis of the evolution of
rymoviruses [12] supports the view that evolution of
sobemoviruses is more rapid than that of their hosts. In
contrast, the addition of further tobamoviral sequences to
the Tobamovirus tree has supported the congruence of host
and virus trees [13]. Further, there is evidence that, in very
long-term analyses, such as through studies of viruses in
herbarium specimens [14] and Greenland ice cores [15],
viruses in the genus are evolving extremely slowly, such
that codivergence is a possibility, while having nucleotide
substitution frequencies of the order of 10-5 substitutions
per site in the shorter term [16].
The viruses in these major examples of putative codivergence of viruses and hosts have RNA genomes that replicate using error prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases
encoded by the viral genomes. Such viruses are expected
to evolve more rapidly than viruses with DNA genomes
which use host DNA-dependent DNA polymerases with
proof-reading ability for replication of their genomes and
could be subject to the action of DNA repair systems on
replication errors or spontaneous mutations [17]. Thus,
for DNA-containing viruses, mutation frequencies similar
to those of host genomes are expected, making the observation of codivergence more likely for these viruses than
for viruses with RNA genomes.
Members of the Geminiviridae replicate their DNA using a
host DNA polymerase and encapsidate circular singlestranded DNAs [17]. This plant virus family is one of the
largest, represented by four genera: Mastrevirus, Curtovirus,
Topocuvirus and Begomovirus, classified depending on their
vectors, host range and genomic characteristics [18-20].
During the last two decades these viruses have emerged as
devastating pathogens, threatening crop production and
causing huge economic losses [20]. Today, geminivirusinduced diseases are among the most economically
important in vegetable and field crops, including beans,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/335

cassava, cotton, maize, pepper, tomato and wheat [2024].
In the process of studying populations from China of
Wheat dwarf virus (WDV) from the Mastrevirus genus of
Geminiviridae, we observed patterns that suggested that
viruses in this genus have substitution frequencies consistent with their replication by host DNA polymerases. The
genus Mastrevirus consists of viruses with circular singlestranded (ss) DNA genomes in geminate (twinned) virions [19], and has 11 recognized species including WDV.
WDV is transmitted in a persistent circulative manner by
the leafhopper Psammotetix striatus L. to barley, wheat,
oats, rye and many wild grasses [25,26]. It was first
described by Vacke [27] in the western parts of the former
Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (CSR) and then found in
many parts of the world [27,28]. Its distribution areas are
increasing and it has recently been detected in Germany
[29], Tunisia [30], Turkey [28], Finland [31], Zambia [28]
and China [32]. The complete genome sequences of 18
isolates, 10, 7 and 1 from wheat, barley and oats respectively, have been determined from the CSR, Sweden, Hungary, France, Germany, Turkey and China [25].
Comparisons of these sequences showed that the isolates
which infected wheat, barley and oats respectively,
formed three distinct clades [25,28]. Schubert et al. [25]
suggested reclassifying WDV into three species according
to sequence differences and host range studies: WDV, Barley dwarf virus (BDV), and Oat dwarf virus (ODV), designations used in this paper.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis of viruses
In the spring of 2004, 2005 and 2006, several diseased
wheat plants showing extreme dwarfing, various types of
yellowing, and reduced or no heading were found during
field surveys in many wheat fields of China [32]. Wheat
samples collected from northern, central, northwestern
and southwestern areas tested positive by PCR for WDV,
suggesting that WDV was widely distributed throughout
China. The full genomes of 28 isolates from different
regions of China were sequenced in this study. Details of
these, together with those of the 18 complete WDV, BDV
and ODV genomes already published, are provided in
supplemental material [see Additional file 1 and 2]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by neighbor-joining (NJ)
(Figure 1) and maximum-parsimony as described in
Methods using Maize streak virus as an outgroup. The
topologies of the two types of trees were identical at all
branch points that were well supported by bootstrap analysis (> 70%) but differed at some branch points with low
statistical support (Figure 1).

Bootstrap analysis supported an unambiguous hostdependent clustering of wheat-, barley-, and oat-derived

samples. The isolates also fell into subpopulations seemingly structured according to geographic origin. Wheat
isolates from China were > 94.8% identical in nucleotide
sequence, whereas > 92% identities were seen between the
wheat isolates of China and those of other countries.
Greater than 94% nucleotide sequence identities were
found among barley isolates. Nucleotide sequence identities were < 69% between wheat and barley isolates. The

oat-derived isolate exhibited 59.7%â69.3% identities to
those of barley, and 68.3%â69.4% to those of wheat. The
values for wheat-barley, barley-oat and oat-wheat comparisons were below the threshold for Mastreviruses species (75%) as proposed by the ICTV [18,25].
Unscaled evolutionary distances from the common ancestors to their sequence progeny were deduced from the NJ

tree. The distances indicated that the barley isolates
diverged from wheat isolates much more recently than the
oat isolate did. The most basal barley isolate was TR2 from
Turkey, followed by those from Germany and the CSR.
Wheat isolates were separated into two groups, the first
one from Europe and the second one from France, the
CSR, and China. The grouping of all of the Chinese isolates in one clade with the CSR and French isolates suggested that they evolved from the same ancestor. The
Chinese wheat isolates were divided into two clades, but
were not clustered by geographical source or collection
time (Figure 1). For example, 10 isolates from Shijiazhuang, Hebei province, were classified into four different sub-clades in the phylogenetic trees (Figure 1).
Dating divergences
Barley and wheat are members of the tribe Triticeae.
Together with the Aveneae, which includes oats, they
belong to the BEP clade of the Poaceae, while maize represents the PACCAD clade of the Poaceae [33]. Maize and
wheat lineages have been suggested to split between 50
and 80 Mya [34] and between 44 and 60 Mya [35]. The
estimate for the wheat-barley divergence from a common
ancestor is 11.4 +/- 0.6 Mya [36]. The divergence of Aveneae (oat) and Triticeae (barley and wheat) has been
placed at 25 Mya [37]. In the absence of provision of an
error for this estimate, we assumed a range of possible
times from 22 to 28 Mya. Thus, the relationships of the
maize, oat, barley and wheat mastreviruses revealed in the
phylogenetic tree of Figure 1 appeared to mirror the taxonomic positions of their hosts, which observation caused
us to test whether their relative divergence times agreed
with estimates for divergences of the host species. Relative
divergence times for the respective mastreviruses were calculated by MEGA and the correspondence between host
and virus times was examined by linear regression. Table
1 showed that the r2 values were greater than 0.99 regard-

less of whether middle, high, or low values for host divergence times were used, with the middle values giving the
best fit. Thus, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the
mastreviruses codiverged with their hosts. Relative divergence times for viral evolution were converted to Mya
times using the slope of the relationship of the middle
host divergence times with virus distance, using the
assumption that variation occurs according to a linear
molecular clock. The results (Figure 1) suggest that the
CSR, French and Chinese WDV isolates diverged from
others 1.5 Mya and the Chinese isolates split off from the
other two 0.4 My later. The radiation of sequences of Chinese isolates was predicted by this analysis to have
occurred 0.6 Mya. Of the sites in the mastrevirus genome,
32% were substituted during evolution from the common
ancestor of WDV and BDV, leading to a calculated evolutionary rate of 1 Ã 10-8 (substitutions/site)/year.
Mastrevirus sequence alignment
To explore further the possibility of the codivergence of
virus and host, we included additional members of the
Mastrevirus family in the phylogenetic analysis. To align
these additional sequences with the previously analyzed
sequences in an unambiguous and reliable fashion, we
considered elimination of regions of high diversity and
regions prone to be different due to recombination.
Regions with high nucleotide diversity were difficult to
align reliably. To identify regions that could be reliably
aligned, the level of genetic diversity (Î¸w and Ï) [38,39]
of WDV was examined in genomic regions (Table 2) or
along the entire genomes of Chinese isolates (Figure 2).
Examination of nucleotide diversity values (Table 2)
revealed few differences among the coding regions. For all
WDV isolates, Î¸w was significantly higher for the Rep
region than for the other three regions, but this difference
was not significant for the Ï nucleotide diversity. The
higher Rep diversity was most apparent among non-Chi-

nese isolates, for which both measures showed significance. Overall, as expected from Figure 1, diversity values
were lower for Chinese isolates than for non-Chinese isolates. For the Chinese isolates, the Ï diversity values were
slightly higher for Rep and RepA regions than for CP and
MP regions. Theta values were not significantly different
from one another. As is generally expected for mastreviruses, the most diverse regions over the 37 genomes were
LIR and SIR [25,28]. Considering only the Chinese isolates, however, the diversity of the SIR region was not distinguishable from those of the coding regions. In the nonChinese isolates, MP diversity could not be distinguished
from diversity for the non-coding regions. Among the
non-Chinese isolates, the SIR region was more diverse
than LIR, while the opposite was true for the Chinese isolates. Overall, SIR was more diverse by the Î¸w measure,
but not significantly so using the Ï diversity value.
A plot of the diversity values as a function of position in
the genome revealed that determinations of diversity over
large genomic regions obscure regions of high diversity
embedded in a background of low diversity (Figure 2).
The diversity distribution presented a fluctuating pattern:
(1) high diversity regions were seen in both non-coding
regions and coding regions; (2) divergence in the movement protein (MP) region was low except for the extreme
5' and 3' terminal regions of it; (3) highly diverse portions
were also located at the 5' terminal regions of coat protein
(CP), replication-associated protein (Rep) and Rep A
genes; (4) in contrast, the lower diversity portions were
located in the central and 3' terminal regions of CP genes
and in the overlapping part of Rep and Rep A genes; (5)
there were two additional high diversity stretches in the
complete genome, one was in the intron, the other was in
the LIR (Table 2). The smallest nucleotide diversity along
the entire genomes of WDV isolates (Table 2) was located
in the CP gene, but the gene also had 5' and internal
regions of elevated diversity.
That regions with relatively low nucleotide diversities represented protein coding regions (Figure 2) suggested that
these regions evolved under negative selection. To test this
hypothesis, frequencies of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions at sites in each of the four protein coding regions were calculated. Nucleotide substitutions at
non-synonymous positions of non-overlapping regions
(MP and CP) were less frequent than those of overlapping
regions (Rep and RepA, Table 3). The Ka/Ks ratios of all
coding regions were lower than 0.22, which suggested
negative or purifying selection (Ka/Ks ratios < 1 indicating
purifying selection) acting on the sequences, with no
genes under positive selection (Ka/Ks ratio > 1 indicating
positive selection). The CP gene had the lowest ratio,
whereas that of the Rep A gene was highest (Table 3).

Mastreviruses are known to have experienced recombination in their evolution [40]. Phylogenetic analysis of
sequences containing recombination junctions can result
in misleading interpretations. Visual inspection of the
alignment of Chinese WDV nucleotide sequences suggested that parts of the genomes of HBSJZ06-11 and
YNKM06-2 isolates derived from a genome or genomes
not included in the analysis. Analysis by algorithms contained in RDP3 [41] confirmed the visual observation.
The result of SiScan [42] analysis (Figure 3) illustrates the
possibility that these isolates were recombinants. The
sequence of isolate GSGG05-2 was used as reference and
is typical of all other Chinese WDV sequences. A Z-value
(significance score) > 3 indicates reliably that two of the
three sequences are more closely related to one another
than either is to the third, identifying the third as a probable recombinant. HBSJZ06-11 was identified as having a
recombinant segment in the LIR on one side of the nick
site, while YNKM06-2 appeared to have an LIR segment
derived from an unknown genome on the other side of
the nick site. Since the recombined segment was nevertheless similar to WDV sequences, the recombination events
likely were intraspecific. Work of others identifies the LIR
and the SIR as frequent sites of recombination. Because of
diversity hot spots in intergenic regions and the tendency
for those regions to derive from recombination, further
phylogenetic analysis was restricted to the coding regions.
Phylogenetic comparison of viruses and hosts
To facilitate alignment, consensus MP-CP and Rep-RepA
sequences were generated for mastreviruses with multiple
sequenced representatives (WDV, BDV, MSV, Panicum

MP-CP trees, the isolates named for hosts in the BEP clade
formed a monophyletic cluster, consistent with branching
patterns of Figure 1. Similarly, the three mastreviruses of
dicotyledonous plants formed a monophyletic grouping.
The branching structure within these groups mirrored precisely the structure of the rbcL trees of the host plants.
Viruses named for hosts in the PACCAD clade were not
monophyletic since MisSV was basal to the clade of BEP
clade viruses in both Rep-RepA and MP-CP trees. Among
the remaining PACCAD clade viruses, ChlStrV was in
basal position and ESV and ScSV branched together in
both viral trees. In the MP-CP tree, insufficient bootstrap
support among the other PACCAD clade viruses prevented further comparison. Relationships between viruses
with PACCAD host names and the hosts are not straightforward as noted by the off-vertical lines in Figure 4. A
comparison of branch lengths among the Rep-RepA, MPCP and rbcL trees suggests that a uniformly ticking molecular clock should not be supported. The dicotyledonous
plants were on a relatively longer branch than the viruses
bearing their names. MisSV had diversified more than the
BEP clade viruses in the MP-CP region, but the opposite
was true in the Rep-RepA region. ChlStrMV also showed
anomalous branch lengths. Such anomalies are signs of
recombination events after which adjustment of the
recombined segments to one another is needed [8]. A
series of molecular clock tests supported these observations. A clock could be rejected if all viral sequences were

Evidence of recombination in the evolution of Chinese WDV isolates
Evidence of recombination in the evolution of Chinese WDV isolates. SiScan analysis, as implemented in RDP3 program (v 1.5), was performed on 29 WDV genomes from China. Shown are the results of comparison of the only two isolates
(HBSJZ06-11 and YNKM06-2) that yielded significant recombination signatures when compared to a reference genome, in this
case GSGG05-2. The genome organization of WDV (linearized at nucleotide position 1) is shown for orientation, including the

considered, regardless of which sequence was chosen as
outgroup for the tree to be tested. However, when ChlStrV
or the viruses of dicotyledonous plants were omitted with
MisSV as outgroup, a clock could no longer be rejected.
Operation of a clock was predicted with confidence (p >
0.9) for a dataset containing WDV, BDV, ODV, MisSV and
ChlStrV with ChlStrV as outgroup.
TreeMap analysis
Distance trees constructed from an alignment of a subset
of rbcL gene sequences and of the respective viruses were
analyzed (Figure 5) by TreeMap [43,44]. The algorithm
resulted in reconciliation of the two trees by the addition
of two host species jumps by viruses (Figure 5). One was
of the lineage that gave rise to the Egypt species of ScSV

from a non-sugarcane lineage to the sugarcane lineage.
The second jump was of MSV to maize, consistent with
the long term existence of the virus in Africa before the
arrival of maize in the continent [45]. The confidence
level assigned to the reconciled tree was p < 0.01. Neither
of the two trees had been rooted, though it is known that
the host tree has its root between Chloris and Avena
branches.

Discussion
The ICTV proposed a reduced similarity value for the
demarcation of species in the case of mastreviruses (75%),
compared to that for the majority of geminiviruses (89%)
[18]. In our analysis, we found 68% nucleotide sequence
identity between wheat and barley isolates, and 59.7%â

69.3% between oat and barley isolates. The nucleotide
sequence identities between oat and wheat isolates were
68.3%â69.4%, similar to the results of others [25]. The
phylogenetic trees also supported strongly the proposal
that WDV should be divided into three mastrevirus species [25], a proposal with which we agree.
Several observations favor the hypothesis that mastreviruses codiverged with their hosts. First, despite the known
propensity for mastreviruses to recombine during evolu-

tion [40], exemplified by the evidence of recombination
in the evolution of two WDV isolates from China (Figure
3), the similarity of Rep-RepA and MP-CP Mastrevirus trees
to one another (Figure 4) suggests that recombination had
been eliminated as a major factor shaping trees by concentrating on the coding regions. Second, the topologies of
maize, oat, barley and wheat lineages and the lineages of
their mastreviruses (MSV, ODV, BDV, and WDV) were
identical (Figure 1) as were the topologies of dicotyledonous plants and their viruses (Figure 4). Third, not only

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:335

did the topologies agree, but there was an excellent correlation between estimated divergence times of the plant
lineages and the relative divergence times of the mastreviruses, as calculated from the sequences (Table 1).
Nevertheless, support for the hypothesis of codivergence
of host and virus is not conclusive. That the molecular
clock has not been ticking uniformly in all lineages and in
both halves of the viral genome removes the molecular
clock as a tool for testing the codivergence hypothesis. Evidence for uneven ticking of the clock, such as in MisSV
and ChStrMV branches, may be attributable to recombination. Yet, it is interesting that there was statistical support for a clock operating in one part of the overall tree.
That part specifically included two of the branch points
for which there are dates associated with divergences of
plant lineages (of Triticum from Hordeum and of Triticeae
from Aveneae). It is also noteworthy that adding the third
datable branch (PACCAD clade from BEP clade) led to a
near perfect correlation of host divergence times with relative viral divergence times (Table 1).
Non-congruence of PACCAD clade host branching patterns with branching patterns of viruses named for those
hosts seems to argue against the codivergence hypothesis.
However, it must be remembered in this regard that virus
names are based on the host plant from which the virus
was first isolated. Thus, the names do not necessarily
reflect the plant lineage in which the virus spent most of
its time evolving. Indeed, non-congruence is expected for
viruses that can efficiently infect many species of plants.
MSV isolates have been found in many grass genera
including Zea, Panicum, Setaria, Urochloa and even Triticum [40]. Further, their presence in maize is of recent origin since the streak viruses are indigenous to Africa and
Indian Ocean islands and maize was only introduced to
Africa after the European discovery of America [45]. Similarly, sugar cane is not native to Africa but is infected by a
complex of related virus species (Sugarcane streak virus,
Sugarcane streak Reunion virus, Sugarcane streak Egypt virus
and Eragrostis streak virus) which have been isolated from
native grasses of the genera Setaria, Cenchrus, Paspalum
and Eragrostis, indicating a wide host range [46]. In contrast, the BEP clade viruses, WDV, BDV and ODV specialize in infecting their respective host plants and thus likely
have evolved entirely in the lineage for which they are
named [25].
Estimates of short term and longer term evolution rates
are available for viruses in the sister genus, Begomovirus.
Inoculation of plants with infectious cloned DNA of
Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCV) resulted in the
subsequent recovery of viral sequences with substitutions
at a frequency of about 10-4 substitutions per site during a
60 day growth period in plants [47]. Consistent with the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/335

experimental result, phylogenetic analysis suggested a
substitution frequency of 5 Ã 10-4 per site per year for the
related Tomato yellow leaf curl virus [17]. Thus on these
time scales, the genomes change as frequently as most
RNA virus genomes [48,49]. These time scales sample
sites that evolve rapidly. The distribution of nucleotide
diversity along the WDV genome (Figure 2) shows that
areas of the genome with high diversity represent only a
small percentage of the total genome. In the TYLCCV
study [47], four nucleotide positions accounted for close
to half (18 of 41) of the observed substitutions. Thus, it is
likely that highly mutable positions gave rise to the substitutions in the Begomovirus investigations, while the deeper
phylogenetic tree construction employed in our Mastrevirus work focuses on the areas of the genome with low
nucleotide diversity. These are also the areas subjected to
strong purifying selection. The apparent discrepancy
between very long-term and short or long-term evolution
rates in the Geminiviridae is reminiscent of similar findings
in the Tobamovirus analysis. Understanding this apparent
difference awaits further analysis.

Methods
Virus isolates
WDV was collected throughout China during field surveys
in the growing seasons 2004 to 2006. The 28 isolates
described here originated from wheat planted in different
agro-ecological areas in China, including the northwestern (Shaanxi and Gansu provinces), northern (Shanxi and
Hebei provinces), central (Henan province), and southwestern (Yunan province) areas. All the field isolates were
inoculated to the susceptible wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)
cultivar Fengkang No. 8 by vector leafhoppers (Psammotetix alienus L.) to increase virus concentration and to
allow serological typing or sequencing of polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) products. The wheat plants were
later tested for WDV with ELISA using an antiserum (BioRad, Marnes la Coquette, France). Leaves were collected
from WDV-positive plants displaying typical symptoms of
WDV infection, and stored at -80Â°C. Details of the isolates, their names, provinces of collection, original host
plant, and years of collection are shown in additional file
[see Additional file 1].
Cloning of entire genomes
Total DNA was extracted from systemically WDV-infected
wheat leaves [50]. DNA extracts were used as template for
PCR amplification, performed in a 50 Î¼L reaction solution containing 10ÃTaq Buffer, 2.5 mM dNTP (each), 0.4
mM of the viral sense and complementary sense primers
designed according to the conserved sequences of WDV
genomes [see Additional file 3], and Ampli Taq DNA
polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
PCR reactions were carried out for 35 cycles, each consisting of denaturation at 94Â°C for 1 min, annealing at 55Â°C

Page 10 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:335

for 1 min, and extension at 72Â°C for 1 min, with 95Â°C for
2 min at the beginning and 72Â°C for 10 min at the final
step. The expected PCR products were 767 bp, 1152 bp
and 1041 bp, using the primer pairs of 40F/806R, 735F/
1886R and 1828F/118R, respectively, and together covered the entire length of the viral genome. The PCR product segments were electrophoresed in 1.0% agarose gels,
bands were excised using a razor blade and purified using
the BioTeq PCR quick Gel Extraction Kit (BioTeq, Inc,
USA).
DNA sequencing
Nucleotide sequences of the entire genome of each isolate
were determined using the above PCR fragments. The
purified fragments were cloned into the pMD18-T vector
(Takara, Dalian, China). The plasmids were transformed
into Escherichia coli strain JM110 and plasmid DNA was
isolated from overnight cultures by alkaline lysis. Insert
sequences were determined on at least three clones for
each PCR fragment using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method by an automated sequencer (ABI
BigDye 3.1, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Sequence data were assembled using DNASIS version 3.5
(Hitachi) or BIOEDIT version 5.0.9 [51]. The nucleotide
sequence data have been submitted to GenBank databases
and assigned accession numbers EF536859 through
EF536886.
Phylogenetic and molecular diversity analysis
Complete genomes of the 28 WDV isolates sequenced in
this study and 18 entire sequences of other WDV, BDV
and ODV isolates obtained from the NCBI database
(National Center for Biotechnology Information,
Bethesda, MD, USA) were analyzed. The coding and intergenic regions were annotated by reading frame or following NCBI's annotations. The complete genome sequences
of the WDV, BDV and ODV genomes were aligned with
CLUSTAL W V.1.8. MEGA V.4.0 [52] determined the
number of nucleotide substitutions per site (evolutionary
distance) between the strains. Phylogenetic trees were
constructed by neighbor-joining (NJ), and maximum parsimony (MP) as implemented by MEGA version 4.0 [52]
and DNAPARS of PHYLIP package version 3.5 [53],
respectively, based on the Kimura 2-parameter distance
matrix model. Bootstrap confidence values were obtained
for 1000 replicates (Figure 1). The homologous regions of
the genome of an isolate of Maize streak virus (MSV)
(NC_001346) [54] were used as the outgroup for these
analyses, as BLAST searches had shown them to be the
sequences in the international sequence databases most
closely related to those of MSV. Treemap 4.1.1 [44] was
used to test and display the correspondence between plant
and virus trees. The Watterson's estimator of Î¸ (Î¸w) [38]
and the average pairwise nucleotide diversity Pi(Ï) [39],
were estimated using DnaSP version 4.10.2 [55]. Also, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/335

program was used to estimate the proportions of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions by the JukesCantor one-parameter model.
To evaluate the sequence relationships among mastrevirus genomes, a selection of mastrevirus sequences available at the time was obtained [see Additional file 2]. A
manually adjusted multiple sequence alignment based on
encoded amino acid sequences was generated using Se-Al
[56]such that MP-CP and Rep-RepA regions were satisfactorily aligned. These regions were separately excised from
the alignment for further manipulation. In cases where
multiple sequences were available for the same named
virus, a consensus sequence was generated by Se-Al. For
examination of host phylogenetic relationships, rbcL
sequences were retrieved from GenBank/DDBJ/EMBL.
They are identified in the legend of Figure 4. These were
also aligned. Aligned sequences were examined using
PAUP [57] by testing models supplied by Modeltest [58].
The parameters for the best model were used to construct
neighbor joining trees as implemented in PAUP. To test
for consistency, bootstrapped neighbor joining was also
performed using Phylip package programs, Seqboot,
DNAdist, Fitch, and Consense [53]. Resulting trees were
manually manipulated to minimize tangles between host
and virus trees. The validity of a molecular clock for several assemblages of sequences was tested using the log
ratio test as described by Posada [59]. To determine selection models acting on the WDV, BDV and ODV genes,
nucleotide substitutions at synonymous (Ks) and nonsynonymous (Ka) positions of genes were calculated by
DnaSP version 4.10.2 [55].
Nucleotide Substitution Frequency and Divergence Times
The average frequency with which mastrevirus sequence
sites mutate in evolution is unknown. For highly mutable
sites the substitution frequency has been estimated [47] at
3 Ã 10-4/site during a 60 day growing period for Tomato
yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV). That value is
clearly an overestimate of the average frequency.

Nevertheless, since our interest was in determining the relative ratios of divergence times of WDV, BDV and ODV
from MSV, of ODV from WDV and BDV, and of WDV
from BDV, the number was used to obtain divergence
time estimates with MEGA software [52]. Host divergence
times were obtained from literature. Resulting calculated
virus divergence times were normalized to 100 for the
(WDV-BDV-ODV)-MSV split and values were plotted
against corresponding host divergences. Linear regression
was used to evaluate the correspondences and to determine an appropriate conversion factor that could be
applied, assuming uniformity of the molecular clock, to
the relative divergence times of the viruses.

Detection of recombination and mutation bias
To investigate the extent of recombination within the data
set, the aligned sequences were examined using the
Recombination Detection Program (RDP3) [41], GENECONV [60], BOOTSCAN [61], MAXIMUM CHISQUARE
[62], CHIMERA [41], SISTER SCAN [42] and and phylpro
[63] recombination detection methods as implemented
in RDP3 [41], (details of program settings available from
http://darwin.uvigo.es/rdp/heath2006.zip). The transversion and transition differences of all pairs of sequences
were calculated using the discalc program (kindly supplied by G. F. Weiller, Australian National University) and
these were compared in diplomo scatter plots [64].
