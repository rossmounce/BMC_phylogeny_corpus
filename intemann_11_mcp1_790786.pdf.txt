pulmonary tuberculosis

Abstract
Background: The monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) is involved in the recruitment of lymphocytes and
monocytes and their migration to sites of injury and cellular immune reactions. In a Ghanaian tuberculosis (TB)
case-control study group, associations of the MCP1 -362C and the MCP1 -2581G alleles with resistance to TB were
recently described. The latter association was in contrast to genetic effects previously described in study groups
originating from Mexico, Korea, Peru and Zambia. This inconsistency prompted us to further investigate the MCP1
gene in order to determine causal variants or haplotypes genetically and functionally.
Results: A 14 base-pair deletion in the first MCP1 intron, int1del554-567, was strongly associated with protection
against pulmonary TB (OR = 0.84, CI 0.77-0.92, Pcorrected = 0.00098). Compared to the wildtype combination, a
haplotype comprising the -2581G and -362C promoter variants and the intronic deletion conferred an even
stronger protection than did the -362C variant alone (OR = 0.78, CI 0.69-0.87, Pnominal = 0.00002; adjusted Pglobal =
0.0028). In a luciferase reporter gene assay, a significant reduction of luciferase gene expression was observed in
the two constructs carrying the MCP1 mutations -2581 A or G plus the combination -362C and int1del554-567
compared to the wildtype haplotype (P = 0.02 and P = 0.006). The associated variants, in particular the haplotypes
composed of these latter variants, result in decreased MCP-1 expression and a decreased risk of pulmonary TB.
Conclusions: In addition to the results of the previous study of the Ghanaian TB case-control sample, we have
now identified the haplotype combination -2581G/-362C/int1del554-567 that mediates considerably stronger
protection than does the MCP1 -362C allele alone (OR = 0.78, CI 0.69-0.87 vs OR = 0.83, CI 0.76-0.91). Our findings
in both the genetic analysis and the reporter gene study further indicate a largely negligible role of the variant at
position -2581 in the Ghanaian population studied.

Background
The monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), also
referred to as CCL2 (Chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 2),
is a member of the small inducible gene (SIG) family.
CC-chemokines are characterized by two adjacent
cysteine residues close to the amino terminus of the
molecule. They are involved in the recruitment of lymphocytes and monocytes and control migration of these
cells to sites of cell injury and cellular immune reactions
[1]. MCP-1 is produced by different cell types in
response to microbial stimuli [2]. MCP-1 signals are
transduced through the CCR2-receptor (chemokine [C* Correspondence: c.g.meyer@bni.uni-hamburg.de

C motif] receptor 2). Distinct microbial components are
capable to induce expression of the CCR2 receptor and
to initiate, dependent on the presence of MCP-1, targetoriented roaming of monocytes.
The role of MCP-1 in tuberculosis (TB) has been subject of research since the early 1990 s. During the course
of an infection with agents of the M. tuberculosis complex, MCP-1 is predominantly produced by CD14+
blood monocytes and by distinct alveolar epithelial cells
[3,4]. Elevated plasma MCP-1 levels are found in TB
patients [3], and the number of macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids in eosinophilic pneumonia correlates with plasma MCP-1 levels [5].
The gene encoding MCP-1 (MCP1; MIM +158105) is
located in the 17q11.2-q12 chromosomal region. It consists of three exons and clusters with the loci CCL7,

CCL11, NOS2A, CCL3-5 and CCR7. MCP-1 expression
may be found in several conditions that are characterized by infiltration of mononuclear cells.
Genetic associations of MCP1 gene variants with susceptibility or protection against mycobacterial infection
have been reported. Carriers of the MCP1 -2581G allele
were at an increased risk of clinical TB in study groups
from Mexico and Korea [4], Peru [6] and Zambia [7]
compared to individuals carrying the alternative -2581A
allele. For MCP1 -2581G, several studies have demonstrated increased gene expression in vitro and elevated
MCP-1 plasma levels in vivo [4,6,8-10]. In contrast to
these observations, Japanese MCP1 -2581AA genotype
carriers exhibited higher MCP-1 plasma levels than did
carriers of the -2581AG or GG genotypes [11]. While
no effect of MCP1 -2581 variants on TB susceptibility
was observed in Brazilian, Chinese, Russian and South
African study groups [12-15], MCP-1 -2581G was associated with protection against TB in a Ghanaian casecontrol study group [14]. Notably, the latter finding was
in clear contradiction to the findings reported in Refs.
[4,6,7], where an increased TB risk was attributed to
MCP1 -2581G carriers.
In the study of the Ghanaian TB case-control group,
MCP1 -2581G was in weak linkage disequilibrium (LD)
with another promoter variant, MCP1 -362C (r2 = 0.27),
which was even stronger associated with resistance to
TB than MCP1 -2581G. MCP1 -362C has been shown
to mediate increased transcriptional activity in vitro in a
Caucasian study population [16]. Again, this finding is
in contrast to the previous assumptions, namely that
increased MCP-1 production might favour the occurrence of TB [4,5,8].
These partly ambiguous findings prompted us to reexamine MCP1 variants that might be involved in gene
expression. According to the MCP1 haplotype structure
obtained from the innate immunity website https://
pharmgat.org/IIPGA2 eight variants that are located in
the MCP1 5’-region, the first intron and in the 3’-UTR
were selected and genotyped in our Ghanaian TB casecontrol group. Those genetic variants that showed the
strongest associations with protection against TB were
then subjected to a reporter luciferase gene assay in
order to study gene expression.

Results
Alleles and genotypes

Eight MCP1 variants were genotyped in 2010 Ghanaian
pulmonary TB cases and 2346 healthy control individuals (Table 1). P values, including those of the previous
study, were corrected according to the Bonferroni-Holm
procedure [17] for the eight comparisons made.
In Table 2, allelic associations of the eight newly genotyped MCP1 variants and of the MCP1 -2581 and -362

Page 2 of 9

variants that were previously typed are given. The deletion of 14 bases length located in the first MCP1 intron,
int1del554-567, was associated with protection against
pulmonary TB to a similar extent as were the promoter
alleles -2581G and -362C (OR = 0.85, confidence interval [CI] 0.78-0.92, Pcorr = 0.00098, OR = 0.81, CI 0.730.91, Pcorr = 0.0012 and OR = 0.83, CI 0.76-0.90, Pcorr =
0.00015, respectively).
The genotype frequencies did not deviate from
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) among cases and
controls. Trend tests were performed to compare the
frequencies of genotypes of cases and controls in an
additive model and results were adjusted for gender,
age and ethnicity. The results are given in Table 3. As
also observed in the computation of allelic associations, int1del554-567 was in the trend test significantly associated with protection against TB (OR trend
= 0.84, CI 0.77-0.92, P corr = 0.00098). In a genotype
test where heterozygous and homozygous genotypes
were individually compared to the wildtype, a strong
association was seen for both heterozygous and homozygous carriers of the int1del554-567 deletion (OR =
0.80, CI 0.70-0.91, P corr = 0.0063 and OR = 0.73, CI
0.61-0.87, P corr = 0.0042, respectively), indicating a
dominant genetic effect. The association of
int1del554-567 was of similar strength as that in heterozygous and homozygous MCP1 -362C carriers in
the previous study (Ref. [14]; ORtrend = 0.83, CI 0.760.91, Pcorr = 0.00017). Both variants were in strong LD
(r 2 = 0.82). int1del554-567 was also in weak LD (r2 =
0.27) with the MCP1 promoter variant at position
-2581. Figure 1 shows the r2 values of pairwise LDs of
all variants examined in the present and in the previous study [14].
Stratification for mycobacterial species (M. tuberculosis vs. M. africanum) and phylogenetic lineages did not
reveal any differences in the associations. Thus, possible
confounding exerted by mycobacterial species or distinct
genotypes was excluded.
Haplotypes

We focused on haplotypic combinations comprising the
polymorphisms genotyped in our previous study, MCP1
-2581A/G and -362C/G, and the deletion or wildtype
(W) at intron 1 positions 554-567 (int1del554-567/W),
because the variant alleles at these positions are in LD
and associations of these variants are presented here
and have been described previously [4,6,7,14]. As the
combination -2581A/-362G/W occurred as the most
frequent haplotype in our study population (frequency
[f] = 0.55) it was referred to as wildtype reference in
further comparisons (Table 4).
The haplotype combinations -2581G/-362C/
int1del554-567 and -2581A/-362C/int1del554-567 were

to their impact on gene expression, a luciferase reporter gene assay was performed. Figure 2 shows the plots

subjected to the assay. An overall ANOVA statistics
revealed a significant difference between the FL/RL
ratios (P = 0.0019). The calculated studentized range
critical value in the post hoc pairwise comparisons for
variable groups (Tukey-HSD test) was 4.03, and comparisons of the construct carrying the -2581A/-362G/
W alleles with the -2581G/-362C/int1del554-567 and
-2581A/-362C/int1del554-567 constructs yielded
significant results that were above the studentized
range critical value (Tukey-HSD test 4.53 and 5.44,
respectively).
The P values of a t-test that was calculated with the
haplotype -2581A/-362G/W set as reference are given in
Table 5. The constructs -2581G/-362C/int1del554-567
and -2581A/-362C/int1del554-567 expressed the luciferase gene to a significantly lower degree than did the
wildtype construct -2581A/-362G/W (P = 0.02 and P =
0.006, respectively).

Discussion
We have recently described an association of the MCP1
-2581G and -362C alleles with protection against TB in a
Ghanaian study group [14]. The variants at these positions were in weak linkage disequilibrium (LD; r2 = 0.27;
Figure 1). In contrast to our observation of protection
conferred by the MCP1 -2581G and -362C alleles, earlier
research in study groups from Mexico, Korea, Peru and
Zambia has attributed to MCP1 -2581G an increased risk
to develop clinical TB [4,6,7]. Moreover, MCP1 -2581G
and -362C were shown to enhance promoter activity in
vitro in individuals from Korea (MCP1 -2581G) and in
Caucasians (MCP1 -2581G and -362C), respectively
[8,9,15], consistent with studies indicating that in pulmonary TB MCP-1 plasma levels are elevated [3,4].
Among the eight variants that were in LD with MCP1
-362 and/or MCP1 -2581 according to data available
from NCBI and therefore subjected to genotyping in the

int1del554-567/W) in the study group (Figure 1), haplotypes might explain more adequately than single mutations the genetic association and its relation to MCP-1
production. All haplotypic combination comprising the
variants MCP1 -2581G/A, MCP1 -362C/G and
int1del554-567/W and occuring at frequencies (f) >0.01
were considered (Table 4). The strongest association of
protection against TB was with the haplotypic combination -2581G/-362C/int1del554-567 (f = 0.19) compared
to the wildtype haplotype -2581A/-362G/W (f = 0.54;
OR = 0.78, CI 0.69-0.87, P = 0.00002). Carriers of the
haplotypic combination -2581A/-362C/int1del554-567

(f = 0.23) are slightly less, but still significantly protected
against TB (OR = 0.87, CI 0.78-0.96, P = 0.008).
To further examine the influence of haplotypes on the
promoter activity, a reporter luciferase assay with constructs comprising the -2581A/G and -362C/G promoter variants, the first exon (149 bp) and the intronic 14
bp deletion int1del554-567 or the wildtype sequence at
these positions was performed. Only those combinations
that occurred in frequencies >1% in the study population were included. The findings of the reporter gene
assay corresponded to the results of the genetic analysis.
A significant decrease of gene expression occurred in
constructs carrying the -2581G/-362C/int1del554-567
and -2581A/-362C/int1del554-567 combinations (P =
0.02 and P = 0.006, respectively; Table 5). It may be
inferred from the results of the reporter gene assay that
both variants, MCP1 -362C and int1del554-567, exert a
reduction of the transcriptional activity, eventually
resulting in lowered production of MCP-1.

Several mechanisms might be involved in the decrease
of MCP-1 production. First, MCP1 -362G constitutes a
binding site for the Signal Transducer and Activator of
Transcription 1 (Stat-1) [16]. Stat-1 is a transcription
factor that enhances gene expression, and deprivation of
Stat-1 binding through a loss of its binding site might
reduce gene transcription, as seen in the luciferase
assay. Another mechanism for a reduction of transcription is provided by the fact that Intronic deletions often
cause a decrease of transcriptional activity [18,19] and
influence RNA stability [20]. Lastly, the 14 bp deletion
int1del554-567 in the first intron of the MCP1 gene
causes a loss of a predicted alternative splice site http://
zeus2.itb.cnr.it/~webgene/wwwspliceview_ex.html. While
transcripts with several alternative splice sites appear to
be more robust, a loss of transcription sites could promote random degeneration in the nucleus [21]. It is,

therefore, reasonable to ascribe a reduced MCP-1 production to the int1del554-567 deletion.

Conclusions
In addition to the results of the previous study of the
Ghanaian TB case-control sample, we have now identified the haplotype combination -2581G/-362C/
int1del554-567 that mediates stronger protection than
does the MCP1 -362C allele alone (OR = 0.78, CI 0.690.87 vs OR = 0.83, CI 0.76-0.91). Our findings in both
the genetic analysis and the reporter gene study further
indicate a largely negligible role of the variant at position -2581.
The genetic risk of TB observed for variation in the
MCP1 promoter and in intron 1 is most likely conferred
through an alteration of the MCP1 expression, in line
with the previous findings that increased MCP-1 production favours the occurrence of clinical TB. A similar
observation was made in a mouse model for infections
with both Listeria monocytogenes and M. tuberculosis,
where increased MCP1 expression in transgenic mice
led to a 1 to 1.5 log greater sensitivity to infection [22].
It has been described that in MCP1 deficient mice subjected to low-dose aerosol infection with M. tuberculosis
Erdman the number of macrophages that enter the lung
is decreased. As a consequence, these mice initially harbour higher bacterial loads in their lungs compared to
control animals, but eventually established a stable state
of chronic disease [23]. No significant difference to
MCP1 wildtype mice in the susceptibility to intravenous
infection was found [24]. It was also shown that mice
that overexpress MCP1 in their lungs exhibit increased
uptake of M. tuberculosis BCG in dendritic cells compared to wildtype animals [25].
To date it remains unclear why high MCP-1 levels
cause increased TB susceptibility in humans and how
MCP-1 levels interact with the efficiency of the MCP-1
gradient. Pertinent explanations could be that high systemic concentrations of MCP-1 would trigger the desensitization of receptors and reduce signal transduction or
might lead to an adjustment and, as a consequence, to
the neutralization of the chemoattractant gradient that

Intemann et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:34
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/34

is required to escort sensitive monocytes to the sites of
tissue damage.

Methods
Study group

The study design and the enrollment procedure have
been described in detail previously [14,26]. In brief, participants were recruited at the two major Ghanaian
teaching hospitals in Accra and Kumasi and at additional hospitals and polyclinics in these metropolitan
areas and at regional district hospitals. 2010 HIV-negative individuals with smear- and/or culture-positive pulmonary TB were recruited as cases. The control group
consisted of 2346 individuals, from whom 1211 were
unrelated personal contacts of cases and 1135 were
community members from the adjacent neighbourhood
or working contacts. The proportion of ethnic groups
did not differ significantly between cases and controls.
Participants belonged to the ethnic groups of Akan, GaAdangbe, Ewe and groups from northern Ghana, including Dagomba, Sissala, Gonja and Kusasi. The male-tofemale ratio in the total study group was 1:0.58, and the
mean age of participants was 33 years without gender
differences. The characterization of phenotypes included
documentation of the medical history of cases on structured questionnaires, two independent examinations of
non-induced sputum specimens, serological determination of the HIV status, culturing and molecular differentiation of phylogenetic lineages of mycobacterial clades
and posterior-anterior chest X-rays. Positive HIV test
results were verified in an alternate test system. Finetyping of genotypes by spoligotyping, IS6110 fingerprinting and determination of drug resistance was performed
as previously described [14]. TB-patients were included
for specific treatment in the DOTS programme (Directly
Observed Treatment Short-Course strategy) organized
by the Ghanaian National Tuberculosis Programme.
Of the control group, the medical history was obtained
and a clinical examination was performed. Chest X-rays
did not reveal any signs of actual or past pulmonary TB.
In addition, a tuberculin skin test (TST, Tuberculin Test
PPD Mérieux, bioMérieux, Nürtingen, Germany) was
performed. The TST was positive in 2217 controls and
129 control individuals were TST-negative.
Ethical approval of the study design was obtained by
the Committee on Human Research, Publications and
Ethics, College of Health Sciences, Kwame Nkrumah
University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana,
and the Ethics Committee of the Ghana Health Service,
Accra, Ghana. Informed consent was given by study participants either by signature or, in case of illiteracy, by
thumbprint in the presence of a witness. The aims of
the study and the procedure of venous blood collection
were explained before blood samples were taken.

Variants selected for genotyping; genetic analyses

According to the most recent data of the haplotype
structure of MCP1 obtained from the innate immunity
database https://pharmgat.org/IIPGA2/PGAs/InnateImmunity/CCL2/ we selected eight MCP1 polymorphisms
that are in LD with the MCP1 -362 promoter variant
which has previously shown the strongest association
[14].
Table 1 lists the variants that were selected, including
their rs numbers and PCR amplification primers as well
as sensor/anchor nucleotides for LightTyper-based genotyping. Three variants are located in the promoter
region, two in the first intron and three in the 3’-UTR.
Standard methods were applied to extract DNA from
full venous blood and genotypes of the MCP1 variants
were determined by fluorescence resonance energy
transfer (LightTyper®; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
Germany) with dynamic allele specific hybridization.
Databases and statistical analyses

Demographic and self reported data was double entered
into a Fourth Dimension database (San José, CA, USA).
Genotype frequencies and odds ratios as well as HardyWeinberg equilibria (HWE) were calculated with the
Stata 10 software (Stata Corporation, College Station,
TX, USA) and logistic regression was applied to adjust
for age, gender and ethnicities. Allelic and haplotype frequencies and associations were used to reconstruct haplotypes, calculated with the Unphased software (version
3.1.4; http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/personal/frank/software/unphased). P values were adjusted through 10 000
permutations. Haploview version 4.1 http://www.broad.
mit.edu/mpg/haploview/ was used to calculate linkage
disequilibria (LD, given as r2) and to generate the graphical output. The Tukey Honestly Significant Difference test (Tukey-HSD test) was performed for post hoc
comparisons of variable groups in the evaluation of the
reporter gene assay.
The power to determine a genetic effect (CaTS software; http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/CaTS/)
with a genotype relative risk of 1.4 was, with 2010 cases
and 2346 controls and assuming a disease allele frequency of 0.2, a prevalence 0.003 and a significance
level of 1 × 10-7 was 89%.
Reporter gene assay, engineering of constructs and
transfection

The PGL2-Control Vector (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) was used for cloning of all constructs of interest.
Four fragments of the MCP1 gene, each of 3569 bp
length and containing the promoter, the first exon and
the first intron, were PCR-amplified with primers 5’caccaagaggagcttttcca-3’ and 5’-gcgcacgcgtcctctgcactgagatcttcct-3’. The MCP1 -2581A/G and -362C/G variants

Intemann et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:34
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/34

as well as the deletion int1del554-567/W were examined. Only haplotype combinations occurring with frequencies >1% were subjected to the reporter gene assay.
The following combinations were included: MCP1
-2581A/-362G/W; -2581G/-362C/int1del554-567;
-2581A/-362C/int1del554-567; -2581A/-362C/W. The
Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany) was used for PCR-amplification.
PCR conditions were: Initial denaturation (94°C, 2
min), 10 amplification cycles (98°C, 10’; 60°C, 30’; 68°C,
10’’), 25 amplification cycles (98°C, 15’; 62°C, 30’; 68°C,
20’’) and final elongation (78°C, 7’’). SMA1 and MLU1
restriction sites at the 5’ and 3’ends, respectively, were
engineered on each PCR product. In an intermediate
step, the fragments were gel-purified, ligated into a
pCR-XL-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA)
and subsequently transfected into Top10 cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. After overnight incubation, cells were
lysated and plasmids were digested with SMA1 and
MLU1 restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, USA). The resulting fragments were then ligated
into the PGL2 Cloning Vector and transfected into
Top10 cells. The final constructs were isolated using an
EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
The Bio-RAD Gene Pulser Xcell system (Bio-Rad
Laboratories Ltd., Hertfordshire, UK) was used for cotransfection of 6 × 106 THP1-cells (German Resource
Centre for Biological Material, DSMZ [Deutsche Sammlung für Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen], Braunschweig, Germany) with 0,5 μg of the phRL-CMV vector
and either 0,5 μg of the pGL2-Control vector or 0,5 μg
of one of the four plasmid constructs. Four hours after
transfection, cells were harvested and luciferase activities
were measured using a single tube Junior LB9509
luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad,
Germany) and the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). After a 10 second
period of Firefly luminescence measurement, 100 ml 1×
Stop & Glo Reagent that is supplied with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System kit were added and Renilla
luminescence was detected in another 10 second measurement period. Ten independent transfections and
measurements were performed for each construct.
