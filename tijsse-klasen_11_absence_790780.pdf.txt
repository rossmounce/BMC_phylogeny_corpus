Abstract
Background: Awareness for flea- and tick-borne infections has grown in recent years and the range of
microorganisms associated with these ectoparasites is rising. Bartonella henselae, the causative agent of Cat Scratch
Disease, and other Bartonella species have been reported in fleas and ticks. The role of Ixodes ricinus ticks in the
natural cycle of Bartonella spp. and the transmission of these bacteria to humans is unclear. Rickettsia spp. have
also been reported from as well ticks as also from fleas. However, to date no flea-borne Rickettsia spp. were
reported from the Netherlands. Here, the presence of Bartonellaceae and Rickettsiae in ectoparasites was
investigated using molecular detection and identification on part of the gltA- and 16S rRNA-genes.
Results: The zoonotic Bartonella clarridgeiae and Rickettsia felis were detected for the first time in Dutch cat fleas. B.
henselae was found in cat fleas and B. schoenbuchensis in ticks and keds feeding on deer. Two Bartonella species,
previously identified in rodents, were found in wild mice and their fleas. However, none of these microorganisms
were found in 1719 questing Ixodes ricinus ticks. Notably, the gltA gene amplified from DNA lysates of
approximately 10% of the questing nymph and adult ticks was similar to that of an uncultured Bartonella-related
species found in other hard tick species. The gltA gene of this Bartonella-related species was also detected in
questing larvae for which a 16S rRNA gene PCR also tested positive for “Candidatus Midichloria mitochondrii”. The
gltA-gene of the Bartonella-related species found in I. ricinus may therefore be from this endosymbiont.
Conclusions: We conclude that the risk of acquiring Cat Scratch Disease or a related bartonellosis from questing
ticks in the Netherlands is negligible. On the other hand fleas and deer keds are probable vectors for associated
Bartonella species between animals and might also transmit Bartonella spp. to humans.

Background
Bartonella species are facultative intracellular Gramnegative bacteria which can infect humans and a wide
range of animal species. Cat-scratch disease (CSD) is
probably the most common Bartonella infection in the
northern hemisphere [1,2]. The hallmark of CSD is
enlargement and tenderness of lymph nodes draining

the site of inoculation of the microorganism [3]. Regional lymphadenopathy usually develops 2 to 3 weeks
after exposure and normally resolves spontaneously after
several months [4]. Thirty percent of the patients report
low-grade fever and a skin or mucous membrane lesion
may be observed at the site of inoculation for 25% to
>90% of patients [3,5]. Extranodal clinical manifestations, such as encephalopathy, neuroretinitis, arthritis,
and lytic bone lesions, occur in approximately 10% of
patients [3,5-8]. Furthermore, Bartonella spp. are an
important cause for blood-culture negative endocarditis
[9-11]. Disease symptoms depend on the immune status
of the host; in immuno-compromised hosts, the bacteria

are often present in blood and involved in angioproliferative disorders such as bacillary angiomatosis and
peliosis hepatis [12]. The domestic cat is the major
reservoir of Bartonella henselae, with a confirmed link
to disease in humans [13,14]. Infected cats are usually
asymptomatic and develop relapsing bacteraemia for
long periods [15]. In a Dutch study, half of the cats
were serological positive, and 22% were found to have a
B. henselae bacteremia [16]. Bites or scratches from
infected cats are associated with development of CSD.
Cat fleas, Ctenocephalides felis, are involved in transmission between cats and may be also able to transmit B.
henselae to humans: Approximately 30% of patients
with CSD do not recall traumatic cat contact [17-19].
Solid evidence to support transmission via cat fleas is
lacking. Other Bartonella species, including Bartonella
clarridgeiae and Bartonella grahamii, have also been
linked to human disease. However, there are only few
reports of disease cases linked to these species [20-23].
The number of cases with tick-borne diseases in the
Netherlands is on the rise [24]: This is illustrated by the
fourfold increase in reported cases of erythema migrans
since 1994, up to 22,000 patients in 2009. The most
straightforward explanation is the reported increase in
the incidence of tick bites [24]. The same tick species
transmitting the etiologic agents of Lyme disease may
also serve as vector of the causative agent of CSD and
maybe also other Bartonella species [25-27]. Several
PCR-based studies have demonstrated B. henselae DNA
in various Ixodid tick species [26,28-32]. A recent study
demonstrated that B. henselae can be transmitted across
the developmental stages of Ixodes ricinus [33]. Altogether, these studies imply that CSD can be acquired
from ticks, but studies contradicting this conclusion
have also been published [34]. One of the aims of this
study is to investigate whether Bartonellaceae, particularly B. henselae, are present in I. ricinus ticks in the
Netherlands and form a risk to public health.
Another class of pathogens that can be transmitted by
both Ixodid ticks and cat fleas is Rickettsiae. They are
fastidious, mostly obligate intracellular alpha-proteobacteria. Hard ticks (Ixodidae) have been identified as vectors of the spotted fever syndrome in humans, which is
caused by at least 15 different Rickettsia species [35].
Two infamous members of this group are Rickettsia
rickettsii, the causative agent of Rocky Mountain spotted
fever, and Rickettsia conorii, the causative agent of Mediterranean spotted fever [36]. Rickettsia helvetica is the
most prevalent rickettsial species found in I. ricinus
ticks in the Netherlands [37,38]. To date, the pathogenic
potential of R. helvetica is unclear but infection with R.
helvetica has been suspected in acute perimyocarditis,
unexplained febrile illness, sarcoidosis and recently also
meningitis [39-47]. Laboratory diagnosis of rickettsioses

Page 2 of 10

is predominantly based on serology. Currently, microimmunofluorescence is considered as a reference serological assay, but most commercially available tests offer a
very limited set of antigens, mostly R. rickettsii and/or
R. conorii, and serological cross-reaction with other rickettsial pathogens are common. Notably, some patients
suspected to have (suffered from) a (mild) rickettsiosis
do not recall a tick bite. In these cases, other potential
sources of infection, for example cat fleas, might be
involved. Cat fleas may maintain and transmit Rickettsia
felis which is the causative agent of flea-borne spotted
fever, also called cat flea typhus or summer flu [48].
Clinical signs are similar to those of murine typhus and
other febrile illnesses [49]. Patients usually have fever,
fatigue, headache, myalgia, rash and elevation of liver
enzymes, although these clinical manifestations do not
occur in all patients. They can also present abdominal
pain, pleuric chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, conjunctivitis, and neurological symptoms [50-54]. R. felis
appears to have a global distribution [48], and it is not
unlikely that R. felis is also present in the Netherlands.
Nevertheless, evidence for the presence of R. felis in
Dutch cat fleas is lacking and no autochthonous clinical
cases of flea-borne rickettsisos have been reported. In
this study, we investigated whether R. felis is present in
Dutch cat fleas.

Methods
Collection of ticks, fleas, deer keds and wildlife samples

Nymphs and adult ticks were collected for recent studies
between 2006 and 2010 by flagging vegetation at 16 different locations in The Netherland (Table 1). Additionally, questing ticks from all stages were collected from
vegetation in Vrouwenpolder in October 2010.
Ticks from cats were collected by veterinarians
between 2006 and 2009 as described [55]. More than
200 veterinarian clinics expressed interest in the study
and were supplied with information packages containing
posters, brochures and collection tubes. Participating
clinics were asked to record host species, residence area
of the pet owner, date of collection and whether the
pets had travelled outside the Netherlands recently.
Deer keds (Lipoptena cervi) and attached ticks were
collected from red deer by hunters.
All ticks used for this study were identified as Ixodes
ricinus according to current keys, and life stage and sex
of the ticks were recorded.
Tissue samples (ears) were collected from wood mice
caught in Duin and Kruidberg area [37].
Fleas from bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and wood
mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) were derived from a previous study [37].
Fleas from 109 cats and 44 dogs were collected by 15
veterinary clinics and volunteers throughout the

Tick lysates were tested for the presence of Bartonella DNA using the gltA-primers. Samples were analysed by gel electrophoresis. PCR products of 380 bp were
sequenced. Only Bartonella-related DNA sequences <99% similar to EF662054 were detected.

Netherlands between October 2009 and October 2010.
Fleas were identified according to current taxonomic
keys and pools of fleas were formed per host animal and
per flea species.
Ticks, fleas and deer keds were immersed in 70% ethanol immediately after collection and stored at -20°C
until DNA extraction.
DNA extraction

DNA from vegetation ticks, dear keds and fleas collected
from cats and dogs was extracted by alkaline lysis as
described earlier [56]. DNA of engorged ticks was
extracted using the Nucleospin Tissue kit (MachereyNagel, Düren, Germany) following the manufacturer’s
protocol for the purification of genomic DNA from
insects. DNA of fleas from a previous study was
extracted by disruption in liquid nitrogen with pestles
followed by homogenization in 600 μl buffer RLT using
a Qiashredder homogenizer according to the manufacturer’s instructions (RNeasy minikit, Qiagen). DNA was
extracted from 300 μl homogenate using the QIAamp
DNA mini kit (Qiagen). DNA was eluted in 50 μl elution buffer. DNA of tissue samples from mice was
extracted with the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
PCR-detection of Bartonella spp

Nymphal and adult vegetation ticks, larvae from Vrouwenpolder, ticks collected from cats and deer, deer keds,
rodent tissue samples, fleas collected from rodents and

pet animals were tested for the presence of Bartonella
spp.. Bartonella spp. DNA was detected by PCR followed by sequencing as previously described (59).
Briefly, the gltA gene was amplified using 5’-GGGGACCAGCTCAtGGTGG and 5’-AATGCAAAAAGAACAGTAAACA as primers, yielding amplification products of
approximately 380 base pairs. A serial dilution of the
cultivated B. henselae ATCC 49882 strain was used as
positive control [57]. The highest dilution was used as a
positive control in PCR and to spike tick- and flea
lysates to identify samples that contain PCR-inhibitory
components. Inhibition was negligible in all tick and flea
samples. PCR amplification of parts of the 16S rRNA
gene was done exactly as described by García-Esteban
and colleagues, using 16S-R and P24Emod as primer
pairs [58].
PCR-detection of Rickettsia spp

Tickets collected from cats as well as fleas from dogs
and cats were tested for the presence of Rickettsia spp.
DNA by PCR followed by reverse line blotting (RLB) as
previously described [38] but with minor modification
(Figure 1). Briefly, the 16S rRNA gene was amplified
using 5’-AACGCTATCGGTATGCTTAACA and 5’-Biotin-ACTCACTCGGTATTGCTGGA as primers. For
RLB analysis the following amino labeled probes were
used: 5’-TTTAGAAATAAAAGCTAATACCG (catch
all), 5’-CTTGCTCCAGTTAGTTAGT (R. conorii), 5’GCTAATACCATATATTCTCTATG (R. helvetica), 5’GTATATTCTCTACGGAAAAAAG (Rickettsia sp.
IRS3), and 5’-TATATTCTCTACAGAGGAAAGATT (R.

ticks with R. helvetica and other rickettsial species, two
RLB probes which were able to hybridize to DNA of
most Rickettsia species except for R. helvetica: 5’AATACCGTATATTCTCTACGGA (NonHelv1) and 5’AATACCGTATATTCTCTGCGGA (NonHelv2). Plasmids containing a 16S rRNA sequence from R. helvetica,
R.conorii, R. typhi or R. prowazekii were used as positive
controls.
Amplification of parts of the citrate synthase gene was
done as described by De Sousa and colleagues using
cs409d/rp1258n and cs535d/rp1258n as primer pairs
[59].
PCR detection of (Candidatus) Midichloria mitochondrii
and phylogenetic analyses

Part of the 16S rRNA gene of “Ca. Midichloria mitochondrii” was amplified from tick lysates of larvae collected in Vrouwenpolder as described [60], using 5’GCTACAGCTCTTGCCCGT (IrESF) and 5’-CAAAAC
CGACTCCCATGGC (IrESR) as primers. PCR amplicons were purified with the Qiaquick gel extraction kit
(Qiagen Inc.) and sequenced using an ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle sequencing Ready Reaction kit
(Perkin Elmer, Applied Biosystems). All sequences were
confirmed by sequencing both strands. Sequences were
compared with sequences in Genbank using BLAST.
Phylogenetic analysis was performed using Bionumerics
version 6.1 (Applied Maths, Gent, Belgium). Reference
sequences were retrieved from Genbank. Sequences

were aligned using Clustal X and distance-based analyses were conducted using Kimura 2-parameters distance estimates and trees were constructed using the
Neighbour-Joining (NJ) algorithm, implemented in the
MEGA program version 4.0. Bootstrap proportions were
calculated by the analysis of 1000 replicates for NJ trees.
With the exception of the 16S rRNA PCR done for
Rickettsia sp., which were analyzed by RLB, all PCR products were separated and analyzed by TAE agarose gelelectrophoresis. To minimize cross contamination and
false-positive results, positive and negative controls were
included in each batch tested for Bartonella or Rickettsia by the PCR. In addition, DNA extraction, PCR mix
preparation, sample addition, and PCR analysis were
performed in separated, dedicated labs.

Results
Vegetation ticks

To investigate the presence of Bartonella henselae in the
Dutch tick population 1527 Ixodes ricinus nymphal and
adult ticks from 16 geographically different locations
were collected from recent field studies (Table 1).
Vegetation types of most sampling areas have been
described previously with the exception of Vrouwenpolder. Vrouwenpolder is a vegetation rich dune area
with several species of deciduous trees and shrubs and
approximately 70% of the soil was covered with vegetation litter. Only very scarce and incomplete information
is available about the fauna of all locations. Nymphs
(98%) and adults (2%) were tested for Bartonella spp. by
PCR on the gltA gene. PCR products of the expected
size of approximately 380 bp were observed in 177 tick
lysates. Sequencing was successful on 98 of these samples. Except for five sequences with one or two point
mutations, all these sequences were identical, and 99100% homologous (372 bp) to an uncultured Bartonella-related sp. isolate from I. scapularis (Genbank
accession number EF662054). Neither B. henselae nor
any other Bartonella species were detected in any of the
lysates of these questing ticks.
Next, lysates from 192 questing I. ricinus larvae from
Vrouwenpolder were subjected to the same PCR against
the gltA-gene. 41 larvae were positive and their
sequences were identical to the Bartonella-related sp.
from nymphs and adults. Under normal conditions,
questing larvae have not yet had a blood meal. Transstadial but not transovarial (vertical) transmission of Bartonella has been described in ticks [33]. Therefore, it is
unlikely that the Bartonella-related sp. in larvae is
directly derived from a vertebrate host. The sequences
of the Bartonella-related sp. might be derived from
another microorganism present in ticks, which is capable of vertical transmission. This is supported by the
fact that gltA-gene of this Bartonella-related sp. does

not cluster with other Bartonella species (Figure 2).
Therefore, the presence of the endosymbiont “Ca. Midichloria mitochondrii” in the same larval tick lysates was
tested by PCR and sequencing using primers specifically
against part of the 16S rRNA gene of “Ca. Midichloria
mitochondrii” [61]. 56 tick lysates yield a PCR product
of the expected size (1250 bp), which successful
sequences (n = 43) were all identical to sequences designated to “Ca. Midichloria mitochondrii” (AJ566640). An
additional, independent PCR using generic primers on
the 16S rRNA of Bartonella species was performed [58]
on the same 192 samples. Five of these samples yielded
a PCR product of the expected size (440 bp). Sequencing of these products yielded 5 identical sequences
(372 bp) which were 99% similar to a plethora of uncultured bacteria in Genbank, varying from an uncultured
Bartonella isolated from the gut of Apis mellifera mellifera (EU055544), Phyllobacterium myrsinacearum
(HQ380017) to a presumed Bartonella grahamii isolated
from Apodemus agrarius (AB529498). As so many different microorganisms had similar homology, we concluded that this part of 16S rRNA gene is not suitable
for detection and identification of Bartonella species.

Ticks from cats

As domestic cats are the major reservoir host of B. henselae, adult ticks may acquire this pathogen while feeding on cats. 265 adult I. ricinus ticks removed from
domestic cats were tested by PCR. B. henselae could not
be detected in any of these tick lysates. In 56 lysates a
fragment of approximately 380 bp was observed.
Sequencing revealed that these samples contained the
same Bartonella-related sp. as found in questing ticks
(Table 2). The tick lysates from cats were also tested for
Rickettsiae by PCR [62]. PCR products were analyzed by
Reverse Line Blotting (RLB), which could differentiate
several Rickettsia species, including R. felis (Figure 1). In
215 lysates R. helvetica was detected (Table 2). No other
Rickettsia species were identified.
Deer keds and ticks from deer

The absence of Bartonella in questing ticks seemed contradictory to previous findings in the Netherlands [63],
where more than 70% of the ticks collected from red
deer were positive for Bartonella or closely related species. Therefore, 96 lysates from adult ticks fed on red
deer were analysed by PCR on the gltA gene. Indeed,

Although the DNA of a laboratory B. henselae strain
was used as a positive control, we wondered whether
the gltA PCR was specific and sensitive enough to detect
B. henselae in questing ectoparasites. For this, fleas collected from pets were also tested under the same conditions as the tick lysates for both Bartonella and
Rickettsia. 32 of 204 pools of cat fleas (Ctenocephalides
felis) were positive for B. henselae. Three pools were
positive for B. clarridgeiae and 43 pools for R. felis
(Table 3). The identity of the latter two was confirmed
by PCR and sequencing parts of the 16S rRNA and gltA
genes, respectively (Figure 1). In one out of 17 pools of
dog fleas (Ctenocephalides canis) DNA of R. felis was
detected. No Bartonella sp. was detected in dog fleas.
One third of the sampled dogs (n = 44) and cats (n =
109) carried fleas positive for R. felis, and one sixth of
the animals had fleas positive for B. henselae (Table 4).
Three cats had fleas positive for B. clarridgeiae.

Adult I. ricinus ticks were removed from cats tested and tested for Bartonella
and Rickettsia by PCR. Rickettsia species were identified by RLB. For Bartonella,
the PCR products of 380 bp were sequenced and analysed. Six ticks were
positive for both R. helvetica and Bartonella-related sp..

the PCR products of 72 lysates (75%) yielded a 380 bp
on the agarose gels. Sequencing revealed that at least 26
ticks contained DNA identical to B. schoenbuchensis
(AJ564632), and 13 ticks contained the Bartonellarelated sp. Sequencing was not successful in all cases,
probably also because of mixed sequences of both Bartonella-related sp and B. schoenbuchensis (not shown).
As B. schoenbuchensis was never detected in questing
ticks (Table 1), we wondered how B. schoenbuchensis
was transmitted between red deer. In the literature, deer
keds (Lipoptena cervi) have been suggested to transmit
B. schoenbuchensis between red deer as they have shown
to be infected with B. schoenbuchensis [64]. We tested
whether this was also the case in the Netherlands. For
this, 56 deer keds were collected, lysed and a PCR on
part of the gltA gene was performed. 46 deer keds were
found to be positive of B. schoenbuchensis (AJ564632).
Tissue samples from rodents

The origin of the Bartonella-related sp. from questing
ticks was further investigated. One of the most prominent vertebrate hosts of I. ricinus are probably rodents.
To determine whether mice are a potential reservoir of
this Bartonella-related sp., 96 DNA samples from ear
tissue of small rodents, Myodes glareolus and A. sylvaticus, from the Duin en Kruidberg area were tested by
PCR and sequencing a 380 bp part of the gltA gene.
Twelve rodent samples were positive, but sequencing
revealed that these sequences (n = 5) were 98-99% similar to Bartonella isolates from A. flavicollis (yellownecked mouse) from Slovenia (347 bp, DQ155393) and
Greece (338 bp, AY435110). The Bartonella sequences
from these rodents were only 70% similar to the Bartonella-related sp. from questing ticks (Figure 2).

Discussion
One of the major aims of this study was to investigate
whether questing I. ricinus ticks transmit Bartonella
species, particularly B. henselae, to humans [31,65,66].
In the 1719 questing ticks that were analysed, B. henselae was not found (Table 1). A gltA sequence, which
was found in approximately 10% of the nymph and
adult ticks, was closely related to a sequence found in
I. scapularis ticks [67]. This sequence was designated
previously as a Bartonella sp.. Phylogenetic analysis
showed that the gltA sequence of this Bartonellarelated species did not cluster with other Bartonella
species (Figure 2). Furthermore, this Bartonella-related
sequence was also found in lysates from 41 of 192
questing I. ricinus larvae, implying that the sequence is
either from an environmental contamination or from a
microorganism that is transmitted transovarially. To

Data are from Table 3, but now presented as prevalence in cats and dogs
with fleas.

the best of our knowledge, transovarial transmission of
Bartonella has never been demonstrated. Our data
support this: B. schoenbuchensis was found in 75% of
the adult ticks feeding on deer, but never in the questing larvae or nymphs tested in this study. We conclude
that it is unlikely that the Bartonella-related sequence
found in ticks is from a Bartonella species. Instead, we
propose that the gltA sequence found in the questing
I. ricinus ticks is from “Ca. Midichloria mitochondrii”,
an endosymbiont found in various hard ticks, including
I. ricinus [61]. Only a few genes, but not the gltA gene,
of this microorganism have been amplified and
sequenced [68]. The presence of “Ca. Midichloria
mitochondrii” in Dutch I. ricinus ticks was shown here
by PCR and sequencing part of its 16S rRNA gene
(Figure 2). “Ca. Midichloria mitochondrii” is present in
mitochondria of tick cells and cannot be isolated or
cultured. However, it cannot be excluded that the gltA
gene isolated from tick lysates is unrelated to “Ca.
Midichloria mitochondrii”.
In this study, we have identified several Bartonella
species: B. henselae and B. clarridgeiae, B. grahamii and
another rodent-related Bartonella species and B. schoenbuchensis. As far as we know, the presence of these Bartonella species in the Netherlands is described here for
the first time, except for B. henselae [69]. None of these
were detected in this study in questing I. ricinus ticks.
Statistically, less than 0.2% of the questing ticks might
be infected with B. henselae or any other Bartonella species (95% exact binomial confidence interval). Therefore
the risk of contracting bartonellosis from I. ricinus ticks
in the Netherlands seems to be very low.
Questing I. ricinus larvae were subjected to PCR using
generic primers on the 16S rRNA of Bartonella species
[64]. Five of these samples were positive and yielded 5
identical sequences which were 99% similar to a
plethora of uncultured bacteria in Genbank, varying
from an uncultured Bartonella isolated from the gut of
Apis mellifera mellifera, Phyllobacterium myrsinacearum
to a presumed Bartonella grahamii. This high variety of
hits indicates that the 16S rRNA gene has too little resolution power to positively identify a Bartonella species
or to distinguish Bartonella from other, closely related

Page 7 of 10

genera. Furthermore, results of a BLAST depend on the
quality of sequences in the database. In an earlier publication we discussed the pitfalls of using a database with
only verified sequence types which neglects large
amounts of less well verified but valuable data [70].
Using a large and freely accessible database like that of
NCBI, however, has its own pitfalls as the quality of
submitted sequences is not always good and identities of
sequenced species are not always verified. Bartonella sp.,
Rickettsia sp. and “Ca. Midichloria mitochondrii” are
very difficult to culture and some species have not yet
been cultured at all. For uncultured microorganisms
often only a limited number of genes are known and
based on the limited data available it can be difficult to
identify a microorganism to genus level. This can lead
to misnaming of database entries which in turn can lead
to further misidentifications [70].
While ticks seem to play a negligible role in Bartonella transmission, other ectoparasites, especially fleas,
might be involved in the enzootic cycle of Bartonella in
animals. B. henselae and B. clarridgeiae were found in
cat fleas, and B. grahamii and another rodent-related
Bartonella species were found in fleas collected from
rodents, and B. schoenbuchensis in deer keds. All these
ectoparasites could transmit Bartonella between animals
and maybe also from animals to humans. B. henselae is
well known to be associated to human cases of bartonellosis in the form of cat scratch disease [7,8]. It is mainly
transmitted directly from cats to humans but might also
be transmitted by infected cat fleas [19]. To date,
including the current study, the transmission of B. henselae to humans via ticks has not been proven and the
risk of transmission by tick is probably negligible [71].
B. clarridgeiae has also been frequently reported from
cats and their ectoparasites [17,72] but has so far only
incidentally been reported from human cases [20,22].
Cat fleas could play a role in B. clarridgeiae transmission but the route of transmission has not yet been
established.
B. schoenbuchensis has been hypothesized to be
involved in the development of deer ked dermatitis, a
sometimes long-lasting skin condition following bites of
deer keds [73]. While the exposure of the general population to deer keds is rather low, some specific groups
like forest workers and hunters are at high risk to be
bitten by these arthropods. In this limited population,
deer keds might play a role in transmission of B. schoenbuchensis. In the general population exposure to B. henselae is much more likely than exposure to any of the
other discussed Bartonella species. It is therefore also
likely to cause most bartonellosis cases. Further research
is necessary to determine the risk of zoonotic transmission of different Bartonella species upon a bite of cat
fleas and other arthropods.

Conclusions
Risk of human bartonellosis transmitted by I. ricinus
ticks is negligible while other arthropods, including deer
keds and fleas, can potentially transmit Bartonella sp. to
humans. Earlier reports of high infection rates of questing ticks with a Bartonella species might in fact be due
to the misidentification of “Ca. Midichloria mitochondrii” as Bartonella sp..
