Abstract
Background: The rapidly increasing number of completely sequenced genomes led to the
establishment of the COG-database which, based on sequence homologies, assigns similar proteins
from different organisms to clusters of orthologous groups (COGs). There are several
bioinformatic studies that made use of this database to determine (hyper)thermophile-specific
proteins by searching for COGs containing (almost) exclusively proteins from (hyper)thermophilic
genomes. However, public software to perform individually definable group-specific searches is not
available.
Results: The tool described here exactly fills this gap. The software is accessible at http://www.uniwh.de/pcogr and is linked to the COG-database. The user can freely define two groups of
organisms by selecting for each of the (current) 66 organisms to belong either to groupA, to the
reference groupB or to be ignored by the algorithm. Then, for all COGs a specificity index is
calculated with respect to the specificity to groupA, i. e. high scoring COGs contain proteins from
the most of groupA organisms while proteins from the most organisms assigned to groupB are
absent. In addition to ranking all COGs according to the user defined specificity criteria, a graphical
visualization shows the distribution of all COGs by displaying their abundance as a function of their
specificity indexes.
Conclusions: This software allows detecting COGs specific to a predefined group of organisms.
All COGs are ranked in the order of their specificity and a graphical visualization allows recognizing
(i) the presence and abundance of such COGs and (ii) the phylogenetic relationship between
groupA- and groupB-organisms. The software also allows detecting putative protein-protein
interactions, novel enzymes involved in only partially known biochemical pathways, and alternate
enzymes originated by convergent evolution.

Background
The COG-database has become a powerful tool in the
field of comparative genomics. The construction of this
data base is based on sequence homologies of proteins

from different completely sequenced genomes. Highly
homologous proteins are assigned to clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) [1,2]. Each of the COGs consists of
individual proteins or groups of orthologs from at least 3

lineages and thus corresponds to a conserved domain. The
COG collection currently consists of 138,458 proteins,
which form 4,873 COGs and comprise 75% of the
185,505 (predicted) proteins encoded in 66 genomes of
unicellular organisms [3]. In addition, the database now
includes KOGs containing the clusters of seven eukaryotic
genomes. The COG database is an ideal source to search
for proteins specific to a certain group of organisms. Several such surveys aimed at finding (hyper)thermophilespecific proteins that made use of the COG-database are
published. For instance, Forterre detected reverse gyrase as
the only hyperthermophile-specific protein [4]. In addition, a survey to find specific genes important for hyperthermophily [5] and a study identifying thermophilespecific proteins [6] are published. However, those studies
used rather nonflexible tools designed for other purposes
[7] or software especially written and not accessible for the
public. To overcome these issues, a more flexible softwaretool is needed that allows defining the group of organisms
individually for which specific COGs can be searched.
Here we describe phylogenetic COG ranking (PCOGR), a
platform independent software tool capable to rank all
COGs with respect to a freely definable group of organisms versus a group of reference organisms.

Implementation
PCOGR is written in PHP (v.4.3.3) including the domxml
(v.20020815) plugin and runs on an openBSD (v.3.4)
operating system at dmz.uni-wh.de in an apache
(v.1.3.28) web-server environment. In addition, at the clients-side, HTML, javascript, and CSS are used.
Phylogenetic COG ranking (PCOGR) is an online-tool to
analyze the microbial COG, or after clicking "Switch to
PKOGR", to analyze the eukaryotic KOG database.
PCOGR provides a means for determining the specificity
of each COG with respect to the presence of sequences
from organisms belonging to a predefined group
(groupA) versus the absence of sequences from organisms
belonging to a second predefined reference group
(groupB). For that purpose, each of the organisms can be
assigned to one of the two groups or defined to be ignored
by the analysis. The software then calculates a specificity
index S for every individual COG. The highest ranking
COGs (large S) contain sequences from the most groupAorganisms whereas the most sequences from groupBorganisms are absent. To process S for each individual
COG, the algorithm starts at S = 0, adds a constant A for
each groupA-organism and subtracts a constant B for each
groupB-organism being present in the COG under analysis with A = Atot/Btot and B = Btot/Atot where Atot is the total
number of organisms belonging to groupA and Btot is the
total number of organisms belonging to groupB. After all
COGs have been processed in this way, all S-values are
scaled to values between 0 and 1. Then, all COGs are out-

put in the order of their specificity indexes S. In addition,
a graphical representation shows the number of COGs as
a function of their S-values in discrete intervals. The total
number of intervals to be displayed can be specified by
the user (default = 40 for PCOGR and 7 for PKOGR).
A Javascript-mouseover info box intuitively explains all
functions of the graphical user interface of PCOGR. Furthermore, additional information about both, organisms
and output COGs, are available by the implementation of
links to http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Figure 1, 2, and 3 show
screenshots of the parameter input and output sections,
respectively.

Results and discussion
PCOGR allows detecting group-specific proteins by both
ranking all COGs and graphically showing their distribution over their specificity indexes. The graphical representations can be interpreted as follows: If the two predefined
groups are rather related, one expects a single peak in the
middle of the graph, i. e. there are little or no proteins specific to one of the groups resulting in a specificity value of
around 0.5 for most COGs. In contrast, if the two groups
are rather distant, further maxima, either on the left, the
right or on both sides become visible, i. e. there are groupspecific proteins with S-values around 1 and/or S-values
around 0. Even two single organisms can be compared by
assigning the first to groupA, the second to groupB and
ignoring all other organisms. For instance comparing the
closely related Escherichia coli strains O157:H7 EDL933
and O157:H7 results in a prominent single peak in the
middle of the graph whereas two further peaks on the
edges become visible if two more distant organisms e. g.
Aquifex aeolicus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are compared.
Distance and relationship may be interpreted either in
phylogenetic or in physiologic terms. To demonstrate that
physiologic relevant differences in protein distributions
indeed can be detected by PCOGR, two parameter-presets
are selectable: (i) a specificity ranking of hyperthermophile-specific versus non-thermophile-specific proteins as published by Makarova et al. [5] and of
thermophile-specific versus non-thermophile-specific
proteins as described by Klinger et al. [6]. For the ranking
according to Makarova et al., optimum growth temperatures of corresponding organisms belonging to groupA are
all above 80°C and all other organisms are assigned to
groupB. For the specificity ranking according to Klinger et
al., the optimum growth temperature needed for an
organism to be assigned to groupA is above 55°C instead
of 80°C. The user will notice that for the two presets, there
are two additional peaks, the first corresponding to COGs
containing (hyper)thermophile-specific proteins, and the
second peak corresponding to COGs containing mesophile-specific proteins.

A further attractive potential of PCOGR lies in the easy
way to detect novel protein-protein interactions since
physically interacting proteins should phylogenetically
similarly be distributed [8]. Thus, if the phylogenetic pattern for a putative interacting protein target is known, a
ranking with this pattern as the input will result in a ranking of potentially interacting candidates. To simplify such
a procedure, the phylogenetic pattern of a certain COG
defined by the user can automatically be assigned as the
preset of a subsequent ranking. As an example, we performed a ranking choosing the phylogenetic pattern of
COG2025 (electron transfer flavoprotein, alpha subunit).
This ranking resulted in only two high-scoring outputs
(specificity value S = 1): COG2025 (the target) and
COG2086 (electron transfer flavoprotein, beta subunit)
which is shown by x-ray crystallography to build a complex with the alpha subunit [9]. All following proteins
have specificity values below 0.9 indicating the suitability
of such a search for protein-protein interactions.

Not only protein-protein interactions can be detected but
also enzymes involved in the same biochemical pathway
as a certain target enzyme [8]. This possibility may be useful to find the biochemical function of yet uncharacterized proteins given that one or more catalysts of the same
pathway are already characterized. For example, a search
performed with the phylogenetic pattern of COG0135
(phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase), an enzyme
involved in the biosynthesis of L-tryptophan, results in
four (COG0135, COG0159, COG0547, and COG0134)
of the five enzymes involved in tryptophan biosynthesis
at the top four places of the ranking. The beta subunit of
tryptophan synthase is the only missing enzyme also
involved in this pathway. A closer look reveals that this
protein is assigned to two instead of one COGs
(COG0133: rank 29 and COG1350: rank 1770). The latter COG is annotated as "predicted alternative tryptophan
synthase beta-subunit (paralog of TrpB)". This double

phosphoglycerate mutase, AP superfamily) at the seventh
last rank (rank 4867 out of 4873) demonstrating that
PCOGR is also well suited for such a purpose.

Another attractive use of PCOGR can be to look for an
alternative enzyme form catalyzing the same reaction but
originated by non orthologous gene displacement
(NOGD). Occurrence of NOGD in essential functions can
be explored systematically by detecting complementary,
rather than identical or similar, phylogenetic patterns
[10]. A ranking performed with COG0588 (phosphoglycerate mutase 1) indeed resulted in COG3635 (predicted

Conclusions
With the online availability of PCOGR researchers can
perform their own individual searches for group-specific
proteins. This will not only allow a deeper insight into
phylogenetic relationships of organisms or groups of
organisms but also help to detect new highly group-specific proteins worth for isolation and further biochemical
characterization. In addition, novel protein-protein

also suitable to assign proteins of unknown function to
partially known biochemical pathways. A further application lies in the search of alternate enzymes originated by
convergent evolution.
