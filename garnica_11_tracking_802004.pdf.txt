Tracking the evolutionary history of Cortinarius
species in section Calochroi, with transoceanic
disjunct distributions
Sigisfredo Garnica1*, Philipp Spahn2, Bernhard Oertel3, Joseph Ammirati4 and Franz Oberwinkler1

Abstract
Background: Cortinarius species in section Calochroi display local, clinal and circumboreal patterns of distribution
across the Northern Hemisphere where these ectomycorrhizal fungi occur with host trees throughout their
geographical range within a continent, or have disjunct intercontinental distributions, the origins of which are not
understood. We inferred evolutionary histories of four species, 1) C. arcuatorum, 2) C. aureofulvus, 3) C. elegantior
and 4) C. napus, from populations distributed throughout the Old World, and portions of the New World (Centraland North America) based on genetic variation of 154 haplotype internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences from
83 population samples. By describing the population structure of these species across their geographical
distribution, we attempt to identify their historical migration and patterns of diversification.
Results: Models of population structure from nested clade, demographic and coalescent-based analyses revealed
genetically differentiated and geographically structured haplotypes in C. arcuatorum and C. elegantior, while C.
aureofulvus showed considerably less population structure and C. napus lacked sufficient genetic differentiation to
resolve any population structure. Disjunct populations within C. arcuatorum, C. aureofulvus and C. elegantior show
little or no morphological differentiation, whereas in C. napus there is a high level of homoplasy and phenotypic
plasticity for veil and lamellae colour. The ITS sequences of the type specimens of C. albobrunnoides and C.
albobrunnoides var. violaceovelatus were identical to one another and are treated as one species with a wider range
of geographic distribution under C. napus.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that each of the Calochroi species has undergone a relatively independent
evolutionary history, hypothesised as follows: 1) a widely distributed ancestral population of C. arcuatorum diverged
into distinctive sympatric populations in the New World; 2) two divergent lineages in C. elegantior gave rise to the
New World and Old World haplotypes, respectively; and 3) the low levels of genetic divergence within C.
aureofulvus and C. napus may be the result of more recent demographic population expansions. The scenario of
migration via the Bering Land Bridge provides the most probable explanation for contemporaneous disjunct
geographic distributions of these species, but it does not offer an explanation for the low degree of genetic
divergence between populations of C. aureofulvus and C. napus. Our findings are mostly consistent with the
designation of New World allopatric populations as separate species from the European counterpart species C.
arcuatorum and C. elegantior. We propose the synonymy of C. albobrunnoides, C. albobrunnoides var. violaceovelatus
and C. subpurpureophyllus var. sulphureovelatus with C. napus. The results also reinforce previous observations that
linked C. arcuatorum and C. aureofulvus displaying distributions in parts of North America and Europe.
Interpretations of the population structure of these fungi suggest that host tree history has heavily influenced their
modern distributions; however, the complex issues related to co-migration of these fungi with their tree hosts
remain unclear at this time.

Background
Several investigators [1-13] have explored intercontinental patterns of ectomycorrhizal fungus species distributions in a phylogenetic context, but there is little
information on the origin and patterns of speciation in
these fungi. Mushrooms in the genus Cortinarius, section
Calochroi (calochroid clade), with over 100 species,
represent one of the most conspicuous ectomycorrhizal
members of contemporary Northern Hemisphere forest
ecosystems [14]. Previous studies of species in Calochroi
show various patterns of geographic distributions, including local (C. cisticola), clinal (C. arcuatorum) or circumboreal (C. aureofulvus, C. aureopulverulentus, C.
cupreorufus, C. elegantior) distributions. In most
instances fungus species distributions correspond to that
of their host trees within continents and often disjunct
distributions across the Northern Hemisphere show a
similar pattern [15-18]. Overall, the patterns of species
distribution in the Calochroi roughly matches the range
of genera of the host tree families Fagaceae (Castanea,
Castanopsis, Chrysolepis, Fagus, Notholithocarpus, Quercus) and Pinaceae (Abies, Larix, Picea, Pinus, Pseudotsuga, Tsuga) [17-21], however, a few Calochroi species
form ectotrophic associations with members of the Betulaceae (Alnus, Corylus, Carpinus) [22,23], Cistaceae (Cistus, Helianthenum) [24,25] and Malvaceae (Tilia) [24,25].
Host specificity of Calochroi species may be restricted to
a single host species, with host-switching events being
less common and often restricted to closely related plant
species [17,18,20]. Interestingly, allopatric populations/
species on an intercontinental scale display relatively
high host fidelities at the host genus level, suggesting
potential co-evolutionary/co-migratory trends [14].
Species with a broad distribution provide excellent
models for examining their present patterns of spatial
variation, especially where there is an obligate association as with an ectotrophic fungus. An evaluation of
contemporary geographic patterns of these species can
provide a better understanding of speciation and habitat
requirement as well as determine host preference and
host-switching events that have occurred over time. To
date a major difficulty in many mushroom genera,
including species of Cortinarius, section Calochroi is the
difficulty of identifying species [14,26], which historically
has been a major impediment to understanding their
patterns of geographical distribution, ecology, diversity
and evolutionary relationships. There are a limited number of unique morphological features [14] that can be
used to construct robust evolutionary hypotheses within
and between closely related species in section Calochroi.
Based on similarities in basidiomata morphology and
colour some widespread species with largely allopatric
distributions in the Old World (Europe) and the New
World (North America) (e.g. C. arcuatorum, C.

Page 2 of 19

aureofulvus, C. aureopulverulentus, C. cupreorufus (as C.
orichalceus), and C. olivellus) were treated as conspecific
[17,18,20]. On the other hand, the discovery of certain
phenotypic differences between European populations
and their North American counterparts has led to the
recognition of infraspecific taxa, for example C. elegantior var. americanus [17]. Similarly, detailed observations
of morphological variation between European collections
of C. elegantior have resulted in a number of forms,
subspecies and varieties [19]. In our recent phylogenetic
study [14], we confirmed close phylogenetic affinities
between some disjunct populations/species, but we also
found that several European species and their disjunct
North American counterparts showed significant divergence from one another.
Recently the use of DNA sequence data have provided
an independent tool for delineating species boundaries,
and for revealing patterns of evolution history, identifying convergent morphological features and assessing/
estimating species diversity. An evaluation of ITS rDNA
sequences published by us [14] revealed distinct intraand/or inter-continental phylogeographic structuring
within some species, sometimes accompanied by relatively little morphological divergence. In contrast, we
also found relatively low levels of genetic divergence
within and between species with allopatric distributions
in North America and Europe that display substantial
colour variation in major components of the basidiomata. While, considerable progress has been made in
reconstructing interspecific relationships within the section Calochroi through analyses of morphological features and DNA sequences [14,26], however, further
studies are needed to examine how sequence divergence
relates to the separation or divergence of species over
time at continental and inter-continental levels.
Differences in genetic structure among extant species
can be used to infer their evolutionary histories. As previously stated, rapidly evolving ITS regions of rDNA
from disjunct species of section Calochroi found in
regions of Europe and North America show different
levels of sequence divergence. However, to date there
has not been sufficient data to draw consistent conclusions concerning the genetic variation and divergence of
these species. For example, maximum likelihood (ML)
analyses [14] suggest a complex evolutionary history
within C. arcuatorum, including divergence into four
distinctive monophyletic groups with similar morphological features. In contrast, a close phylogenetic relationship was found between species considered to be
morphologically separate from one another; European C.
napus and North American C. albobrunnoides (vars.
albobrunnoides and violaceovelatus and C. subpurpureophyllus var. sulphureovelatus). To gain a more complete
understanding of the evolutionary histories of Calochroi

species (including phylogeographic structure, character
variation, and gene flow), we selected four species for
study: 1) C. arcuatorum, 2) C. aureofulvus, 3) C. elegantior and 4) C. napus. Our species concept is anchored in
the morphology (macroscopic, chemical, microscopic
characteristics) of the basidiomata or mushrooms, which
is the structure associated with sexual reproduction of
basidiospores. Morphological and molecular evidences
show that the four species treated here are each clearly
distinct from other known Cortinarius species. The four
selected species are somewhat rare to uncommon (especially C. aureofulvus and C. napus) across their known
geographical range. They are mainly restricted to more
calcareous soils, exhibit intercontinental distributions
within boreo-nemoral areas, or in the case of C. arcuatorum extend into in the meridional zones [14]. Across
their known distributions, C. arcuatorum is associated
with oak (Quercus), beech (Fagus), hornbeam (Carpinus)
and tan oak (Notholithocarpus) species, and with spruce
(Picea) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) in
Wyoming. The tree hosts grow from lowland regions to
high elevations, up to 3000 m in Costa Rica, and up to
2200 m in Wyoming. Three species, C. aureofulvus, C.
elegantior and C. napus are associated with conifers

including spruce (Picea), fir (Abies), pine (Pinus), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and hemlock (Tsuga)
species in subalpine regions or, less commonly, in midto low elevation forests (western elegantior clade and C.
subpurpureophyllus var. sulphureovelatus (= C. napus)).
Although these host tree genera also occur in Asia, so
far there is no survey of these Cortinarius species for
this region for inclusion in our study.
Here to infer historical events associated with speciation, we collected population samples within four species over geographical distributions spanning Europe,
North America and Central America (Figure 1), used
nested clade, demographic and coalescent-based
approaches to analyse the fast-evolving ITS region of
the nuclear ribosomal DNA. Coalescent-based analyses
incorporate random fluctuations in mutation, genetic
drift and sampling errors into the calculation of demographic parameters, whereas these variations are
underestimated by phylogenetic approaches [27]. We
used these analyses to address the following specific
questions. What are the mechanisms responsible for
the contemporary patterns of geographic distribution
within the four species, including centres of origin and
potential migration routes? And, are species with

allopatric distributions sufficiently distinct from one
another within and between continents to merit a specific designation? To address these questions, we compared DNA sequence variation of species at
continental and intercontinental scales. We also evaluated the phenotypical and ecological features of the
Calochroi species. Special emphasis was placed on
detecting highly labile traits and their patterns of geographic variation among population samples represented by individual collection containing one to
several basidiomata from one group or cluster found
growing in a relatively small patch (genet).
Our findings show that the comparison of population
samples using phenotypical, ecological and genetic characteristics help to clarify questions concerning the historical events involved in the modern distributions of
Calochroi species as well as aspects related to host preferences and host-switching, and the use of a combined
phylogenetic, morphological and ecological species definition. We also discuss the utility and limitations of ITS
sequences and phenotypic characteristics as identification tools for Cortinarius species with wide geographical
distributions.

Results
DNA amplification, phylogenetic placement and
relationship

More than 100 fungus population samples, including
our own collections and those from other herbaria,
were analysed in this study (see the Methods section
for more details). We were unable to amplify the ITS
region for many collections because they were either
poorly conserved or too old, and the sequence quality
was too low, or we amplified contaminant fungi that
probably colonised the dried basidiomata. Analysis of
ITS sequences supported the phylogenetic placement
of a total of 83 population samples identified as
belonging to C. arcuatorum, C. aureofulvus, C. elegantior and C. napus lineages (data not shown). Each species was recovered as a monophyletic clade with high
bootstrap support (Figure 2). The internal phylogeny
of C. arcuatorum is composed of four major lineages:
a clade including population samples from Costa Rica
(I); a clade comprising population samples from Mendocino (Pacific USA) (II); a clade composed of samples
from Del Norte Co (Pacific USA) (III); and a large
clade containing mostly European and two sample
populations from Wyoming (IV), respectively. Within
C. elegantior, several population samples had unresolved positions (V), a portion of North American
population samples are distributed into one well-supported subclade (VI) and European population samples
formed a well-supported subclade (VII). The North
American taxa C. albobrunnoides, C. albobrunnoides

Page 4 of 19

var. violaceus, and C. subpurpureophyllus var. sulphureovelatus and the European taxon C. napus formed a
monophyletic group with not internal subclades. New
World and Old World population samples of C. aureofulvus clustered together with no significant genetic
differentiation between them.
Patterns of nucleotide variation in the ITS region

Sequence divergence of the complete ITS region
between intercontinental disjunct populations ranged
from identical to 4.63% in C. arcuatorum, from 0.16% to
0.35% in C. aureofulvus, from 0.68% to 1.46% in C. elegantior and from identical to 0.17% in C. napus. After
removing indels and recombination blocks, twenty-four
distinct ITS haplotypes were identified among the 83
population samples from the four species analysed: 5
haplotypes in C. arcuatorum and C. aureofulvus, 11 in
C. elegantior, and 3 in C. napus (Figure 3). Nucleotide
diversity (π) estimates for the whole population sample
were 0.024 ± 1.9 × 10-3 in C. arcuatorum, 0.002 ± 3.0 ×
10-4 in C. aureofulvus, 4.2 × 10-3 ± 4.2 × 10-4 in C. elegantior and 5.0 × 10-4 ± 2.0 × 10-4 in C. napus (Table
1). When species were partitioned into sampled areas,
population samples showed similar or lower estimates of
nucleotide diversity. The average per-nucleotide
expected heterogeneity, θw, for the whole sample of
each species was identical or higher than partitioned
sampled areas.
Tests of neutrality and population subdivision

The neutrality tests performed for the whole-species
data sampling had non-significant values; therefore, the
equilibrium model of neutral evolution could not be
rejected. Only in C. arcuatorum were significant values
detected for Fu and Li’s D*, and Fu and Li’s F* tests,
suggesting background selection for the whole sample
(Table 1). The geographical distributions and frequency
of the haplotypes are given in Additional File 1. With
regard to C. arcuatorum, haplotype H1 (I) was only
found in those samples obtained from Costa Rica (Jardín
de Dota and Parque Prusia), while haplotypes H2 (II)
and H3 (III) are specific to California (Mendocino and
Del Norte Counties, respectively). The most frequent
haplotype (H4, IV; 12 population samples) is distributed
throughout the Old World (Germany, France, Italy,
Sweden) and also occurs in the New World (Wyoming),
see population samples IB19870107 and IB19870239.
The single haplotype H5 (IV) is restricted to the Old
World. In C. aureofulvus, haplotypes H1 and H2 are
restricted to the Old World (Austria, France, Germany,
Sweden), whereas haplotypes H4 and H5 were found in
the New World (Washington State) population samples.
Haplotype H3 was found in population samples from
the Pacific Northwest (Washington State) and Mountain

USA (Colorado and Wyoming). In C. elegantior, H7 (V)
and haplotypes H1 (VII) were predominant in the New
World (Wyoming) and the Old World (Austria, France,
Germany and Switzerland), respectively. Haplotypes H2,
H3 and H4 are restricted to Old World and haplotypes
H5, H6 (VI), H8, H9, H10 and H11 were observed only
in those population samples obtained from Old World.
With regard to C. napus, the predominant haplotype H1
was shared by different taxa in the New World (Pacific:
Oregon and Washington State, and Mountain USA:
Wyoming and Colorado) and the Old World (Germany,
Norway, Sweden). Haplotype H2 was found in the
Wyoming populations and haplotype H3 is represented
by a single population sample (JFA 10070) from the
Pacific (Washington State).
Hudson’s tests were carried out to estimate population
genetic structures within and among population samples

from each area (Table 2). Analyses of populations
showed significant differentiation between Costa Rica/
Pacific USA (California) and Mountain USA (Wyoming)/Europe population samples of C. arcuatorum (P <
0.001, K ST = 0.6540, K S = 5.0769, K T = 14.6769);

for Hudson’s tests indicated that New World and Old
Wold population samples of C. arcuatorum (K ST =
0.4619, KS = 7.8968, KT = 14.6769), C. aureofulvus (KST
= 0.3731, KS = 1.3027, KT = 2.0784) and C. elegantior
(KST = 0.3927, KS = 2.0963, KT = 3.4522) were genetically differentiated, while New World and Old World
macro-populations of C. napus (P = 0.6840, K ST =
-0.0251, KS = 0.4322, KT = 0.4216) were not significantly
differentiated from each other.
Network analyses

To clarify the phylogenetic relationship among haplotypes within each species, networks were constructed
using haplotypes from ITS sequences with non-recombining blocks (Figure 4a-d). Nested clade analyses for C.
arcuatorum resulted in one network with two connected
Old World haplotypes (H4 and H5) and three single
unconnected New World haplotypes (H1, H2 and H3)
(Figure 4a). Analyses of C. aureofulvus (Figure 4b)
yielded a network comprising five haplotypes: haplotypes
H3, H4 and H5 were scattered throughout the New
World, whereas haplotypes H1 and H2 were restricted
to the Old World. The haplotypes H1, H2, H4 and H5
were derived from haplotype H3. Similarly, in C. elegantior, haplotypes were contained in a single network
where haplotype H7 has an ancestral position to the
other haplotypes and the Old World haplotypes H1, H2,
H3 and H4 grouped together (Figure 4c). The Old
World haplotypes H1, H2, H3 and H4 appear to be
more related to the Pacific haplotypes H10 (Oregon and
Washington State) and H11 (Washington State). In C.
napus, haplotype H1 is ancestral to the other haplotypes

and was shared by both New World and Old World
populations, whereas the haplotypes H2 and H3 were
restricted to Mountain USA (Wyoming) and Pacific
(Washington State) in the New World, respectively (Figure 4d).
Migration analyses

The four species showed different histories of recombination: two distinct recombination blocks were detected
in C. arcuatorum, four in C. aureofulvus, nine in C. elegantior and one in C. napus, respectively. There was no
evidence of recombination within each of these blocks.
Migration parameter estimates, including population
mutation rate, time of divergence and direction of
migration estimates between New World and Old
World macro-population samples, are shown in Additional File 2. These analyses showed that migrations
between New World and Old World macro-population
samples within C. arcuatorum and C. aureofulvus were
approximately equal in both directions and that these
have occurred at low rates. While gene flow estimates in
C. elegantior indicate that migration appeared to be
slightly higher (with overlapping confidence intervals)
from the New World to the Old World (m 1 = 0.34)
rather than vice versa (m2 = 0.16).
Genealogical analyses

Coalescent genealogies for C. arcuatorum and C. elegantior showed that two ancestral lineages gave rise to the
extant New and Old World haplotypes (Figures 5 and
6). Genealogies inferred for C. aureofulvus (Figure 7)
and C. napus (data not shown) did not have enough

Discussion
The markedly high species diversity within the genus
Cortinarius together with their obligate ectomycorrhizal
status makes the factors that have driven their speciation of particular interest to a broad spectrum of biologists. In addition, the occurrence of widespread taxa
within Cortinarius raises intriguing questions about the
origins of transoceanic disjunct species and the influence of the historical events that have created contemporary geographical distributions.

Basidioma phenotypical features

Detailed descriptions of the macro- and microscopical
structures for each species are given in Additional File
3. The most relevant phenotypical features are summarised below.
(i) Basidioma colour

There was little or no detectable variation of basidiomata colour within C. arcuatorum, C. aureofulvus and
C. elegantior (see Figures 8, 9 and 10). However, population samples of C. napus, showed considerable variation
in colour of both lamellae and veil (Figure 11).
(ii) Basidioma size

Some variation in basidioma size was observed within C.
arcuatorum, where populations from Costa Rica and some
from Europe presented somewhat slender basidiomata in
comparison with other population samples (Figure 8).
(iii) Colour reaction of dried specimens

A pink to pinkish orange colour reaction with 40%
KOH on both pileus surface and mycelia at the stipe
base characterised the basidiomata of C. arcuatorum
populations. Population samples of C. napus yielded a
greyish to dark red brown colour reaction on the
pileus surface, whereas the mycelia showed a pale pink
to intense pink colour reaction. All population samples
in C. aureofulvus had a black reaction on both pileus

Phylogeographical structure and historical demography
of Calochroi species

While it is difficult to determine the origin and migration routes of ectomycorrhizal fungi between North
America, Europe and Asia, one can gain some insight
into the question by looking at host migration patterns
and assuming co-migration of plant and fungus. Genetic
data reveal considerable divergence between populations
across the core range of distribution of C. arcuatorum
and C. elegantior in the New World (Figure 4a, c; Table
2). Since the divergent ancestral lineages were found in
the New World, we postulate this area as the centre of
origin for C. arcuatorum and C. elegantior, and that Old
World populations are the result of relatively recent
demographic expansion (Figures 4a, c, 5 and 6). Migration with host plants [28] through Beringia is one of the
most plausible hypotheses to explain the disjunct population distributions between the New World and Old
World, but migrations through the North Atlantic land
bridge [29] or via long-distance dispersal [30], though a
less likely explanation cannot be completely ruled out.
Genetic breaks between C. arcuatorum populations
within the New World have probably been triggered by
paleogeographic and paleoclimatic events, e.g. the rise of
the Sierra Nevada and other mountains followed by
desertification of the Great Basin, or other events such
as Pliestocene glaciation [30,31]. The European populations of C. arcuatorum and most of the North American
populations occur mainly with trees of the family Fagaceae, with the exception of the population samples in
Wyoming, where this species occurs with conifers.
These known population locations are currently geographically isolated from members of the Fagaceae; however, it is likely that Picea and/or Tsuga were sympatric
with Quercus in the past [32], allowing for the possibility
of a host switch from Quercus to a conifer host.
The coalescent-based analysis suggests that extant
populations diverged from a quite recent common
ancestor early in the evolution of C. elegantior with little

Parsimony probabilities were set at 95%. Sizes of circular and rectangular areas are proportional to the number of individuals with that

gene flow among disjunt populations (Figure 6; Additional File 2). Despite this, very little morphological
change has evolved between New World and Old World
lineages. Hence, the close relatedness of Pacific and European haplotypes of C. elegantior could indicate an
expansion northward along the western side of the
mountains through the Bering Land Bridge, which
resulted in the extant populations in New World (Figure
4c). This evolutionary scenario is compatible with the
migration of Tricholoma (matsutake) between western
North America and eastern Asia, as postulated by Chapela & Garbelotto [8]. The phylogeographical patterns
observed in C. elegantior support the hypothesis that
the current distributions of populations are closely associated with the historical events of their host plants.
Similarly, conifers are the primary hosts for populations

of C. aureofulvus and for C. napus. In most parts of
their ranges, these Cortinarius species are sympatric or
allopatric, although their frequency of occurrence varies,
with C. aureofulvus being the least commonly encountered, C. napus being moderately frequent, and C. elegantior populations being the most frequently
encountered, especially at higher elevations with Picea.
Populations of C. elegantior and C. napus are most frequently encountered in subalpine conifer forests; however, they also occur in more mesic mid-elevations and
coastal sites. Picea is currently a main host plant genus
for C. aureofulvus, C. elegantior and C. napus in western
North America; this has probably been the case for an
extended period of time, with a shift in abundance of
Picea from eastern to western North America several
times over the last 21,000 years [32]; however, Abies,

Pinus and Tsuga are also potential hosts for these species. Douglas fir, another possible host for these species,
appeared in western North America in the mid-Pleistocene [33]. Recent phylogenetic studies of Picea indicate
that it originated in North America (P. breweriana and
P. sitchensis as basal taxa) and that the present

Hemisphere. Subsequently, the comigration with their
associated phanerogams [28,35] through e.g. short-distance spore dispersal may be an important means
explaining the expansion of these fungi from Asia to
Europe.
We cannot estimate times for the divergence of disjunct populations of Calochroi with certainty, owing to a
lack of fossil records. However, it is plausible to
hypothesise that they co-migrated with their host plants,
and that the lineages may have subsequently diverged as
a result of fragmentation and geographic isolation of
ancestral populations due to geologic and subsequent
climatic changes. However, each species has a somewhat
different biogeographical history that likely has been
influenced by different biotic and abiotic factors, such as
dispersal potential and host (phanerogam) history. The
occurrence of these taxa in Asia has not been documented to date. Consequently further sampling across this
region is necessary in order to better understand their
historical distributions across the Northern Hemisphere.
The recent work on porcini mushrooms [4] supports
the idea of a potential link between European, Asian
and North American species in the section Calochroi.

[35]. The literature also notes that the earliest (Paleocene) fossil of Picea is from Montana and that it is well
represented in the Eocene in western North America,
but was not common in Asia until the Oligocene and
not present in Europe until the Pliocene. Therefore, it is
fully possible that populations within C. aureofulvus, C.
elegantior and C. napus have long been associated with
Picea and could have migrated with this and possible
other host plants during glacial and interglacial periods
for millions of years. The findings presented here, in
conjunction with those of Dentinger et al. [4] and Wu
et al. [7] strongly support the key role of Beringia in the
phylogeographic processes leading to speciation and
intraspecific population structures in the Northern

ITS sequences and phenotype as identification tools for
Cortinarius species with wider ranges of geographical
distribution; utility and limitations

Nested clade, demographic and coalescent-based analyses based on the ITS region of C. arcuatorum, C. aureofulvus, C. elegantior and C. napus allowed us to infer
their evolutionary histories. Overall, C. arcuatorum and
C. elegantior exhibited geographically structured haplotypes, with evidence for a more ancient population
expansion. These findings agree with those of Geml et
al. [9,11], who observed a similar population structure
in the widespread fly agaric Amanita muscaria. Interestingly, geographically structured populations within C.
arcuatorum and C. elegantior were often accompanied
by some divergence in basidioma colouration and size in
the absence of any described species (see Additional File
3). By contrast, some populations within C. arcuatorum
and C. aureofulvus with disjunct distributions in North
America and Europe exhibited little morphological differentiation and had identical to relatively low levels of
ITS sequence divergence (identical to 0.3% (2 bp) divergence). Two hypotheses might explain this low degree
of nucleotide variation. First, these taxa might be relatively young, having recently spread across their ranges,
and, accordingly, having had insufficient time to accumulate ITS sequence divergence. An alternative hypothesis is that these results could be a consequence of low
mutation rates at the locus studied. Although some differences in colouration of the basidiomata were found
between western populations of C. albobrunnoides var.

albobrunnoides, C. albobrunnoides var. violaceovelatus
and C. subpurpureophyllus var. sulphureovelatus and
European populations of C. napus, these differences
were not sufficient to consider them as separate taxa.
This suggests that variation in colouration alone might
not necessarily reflect different species or subspecies.
For example, violet pigments in the basidiomata are
highly labile because they are sensitive to solar radiation
and the age of the basidiomata. Therefore, it is evident
that it is important to do careful fieldwork and to consider the variation of macroscopical and ecological features before they are used for taxonomic purposes,
especially characters related to colouration. According
to our analyses, colour reactions with KOH are relatively
stable among populations, whereas ITS sequences, in
certain instances, provide several genetic markers to distinguish species as well as population structure within
the section Calochroi.

Conclusions
Based on variations in ITS DNA polymorphism, this
study revealed different evolutionary histories for New
World and Old World populations within Cortinarius
arcuatorum, C. aureofulvus, C. elegantior and C.
napus. Nested clade, demographic and coalescentbased analyses provide powerful tools for assessing the
effect of historical and contemporary events of the
geographic distributions of these species, proposed as
follows: (i) an ancestral population of C. arcuatorum
putatively with a Wyoming-Europe distribution evolved
into at least three distinct lineages in association with

a variety of fagaceous and coniferous trees in the New
World; (ii) two divergent lineages in C. elegantior gave
rise to New World and Old World haplotypes that
occur almost exclusively in association with Picea
(apart from one Washington State population in
Tsuga/Abies forest); (iii) low genetic diversity among
New World and Old World populations of C. aureofulvus; iv) low genetic diversity among New World and
Old World populations of C. napus. The results for C.
aureofulvus and C. napus could be due to recent
demographic expansion, but the origin of such transoceanic disjunct distributions remains unclear. The scenario of a spatial expansion through the Bering Land
Bridge appears to be the most probable explanation for
modern transoceanic disjunct distributions; however, it
does not represent a complete explanation for the
remarkably low degree of genetic differentiation
between populations of these two species. Our study
reveals patterns of species diversification restricted to
the New World within C. acuatorum and C. elegantior,
however, the relatively few morphological innovations
found among allopatric populations suggest that diversification events may have been driven by ecological
opportunities afforded by the shift to new host species,
edaphic and climate conditions. The morphological
and genetic data described here support a single species C. napus (to include C. albobrunnoides var. albobrunnoides, C. albobrunnoides var. violaceovelatus and
C. subpurpureophyllus var. sulphureovelatus) with
transoceanic distribution. Similarly, C. aureofulvus
shows disjunct distributions in New World and Old

whereas features related mainly to veil and lamellae
colouration displayed high levels of homoplasy and
phenotypic plasticity. Interpretations of the population
structures suggest that host tree history as influenced
by past events (glaciation, mountain building, and
associated factors), was one of the driving forces that
shaped the modern distributions of Calochroi species.

of C. napus from IB. An attempt was made to sample
from throughout the distribution range of these species,
although sampling was dictated by the availability of
recently collected and accurately documented herbarium
specimens. These four taxa were selected because they
represent a diverse set of species/populations, each with
a monophyletic lineage displaying allopatric distributions
in Europe and North America, as previously revealed in
research by the authors [14]. In order to incorporate as
much genetic information as possible from a wide range
of geographical locations for these species, sequences
were obtained from GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/ and UNITE http://unite.ut.ee/ databases. Details of
the population samples used for this study and the geographic location of the sampling sites are provided in
Additional File 4.
DNA extraction, amplification, sequencing and sequence
editing

Total genomic DNA was extracted from dried lamella
fragments using the DNAeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) following the standard protocol. The
internal transcribed spacers (ITS1, ITS2), the 5.8 S ribosomal subunit and the D1/D2 regions of the nucLSU

were amplified with the primer combination ITS1F (5’CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3’) [36]/NL4 (5’GGTCCGTGTTTCAAGACGG-3’) [37]. Subsequently,
those specimens that did not give any amplification products were amplified with the primer combinations
ITS1F/ITS4 (5’-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3’) [38]
or ITS1 (5’-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG -3’) [38]/
ITS4 and 5.8SR (5’-TCGATGAAGAACGCAGCG-3’)/
LR3 (5’-CCGTGTTTCAAGACGGG-3’) [39] or 5.8SR/
NL4. Amplifications of ITS1, ITS2, the 5.8S ribosomal
subunit and the D1/D2 regions of the nucLSU were carried out using a touch-down program with the following
conditions: initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min; 10
cycles with temperatures ranging from 60°C in the first
cycle to 51°C, each cycle decreasing by 1°C; 25 cycles
with an annealing temperature of 50°C, each cycle consisted of an annealing step of 0.5 min; an elongation
step of 72°C for 1 min and a denaturation step of 94°C
for 0.5 min and a final elongation phase at 72°C for 7
min. Alternatively, amplifications of the ITS region for
those specimens with negative results using Taq DNA
polymerase (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) were carried out using 25 μL Phusion™ HighFidelity DNA polymerase-mediated reactions (Finnzymes

Oy, Keilaranta, Finland) with an initial heating of 95°C
for 60 seconds, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at
94°C; 30 seconds, annealing at 50°C-55°C; 30 seconds
and extension at 72°C; and 45-90 seconds, followed by a
final extension of 72°C for 10 minutes. Amplification
products were electrophoresed in a 0.7% agarose gel and
stained with ethidium bromide for visualization of the
bands. PCR products were cleaned using ExoSAP-IT®
(USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH, USA) reagent diluted
1: 20 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Both
DNA strands were cycle-sequenced with the amplification primers and, in some cases, internal primers as
indicated in Garnica et al. [40]. Clean PCR products
were sequenced in both directions with a 1: 6 diluted
dye terminator sequencing kit (Big Dye 3.1; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) on an ABI Prism 3130 ×
l Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Unpublished
molecular data from our lab indicate non-sequence
divergence among individuals within the same collection; therefore, we sequenced only one individual per
collection. Forward and reverse sequence fragments
were assembled and edited using Sequencher version 4.1
(Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA).

sequences newly generated in this study were submitted
to GenBank (accession numbers GU363452-GU363497).
All sequences within one species were collapsed into
haplotypes removing indels and excluding infinite-site
violations using Map as implemented in SNAP Workbench [48,49]. A site-incompatibility matrix was calculated to assess compatibility among all variable
characters, with incompatible characters being subsequently removed. Sites are called compatible if there is a
phylogeny which both can evolve on without homoplasy.
Two or more variable sites showing an identical pattern
of compatibility are considered to form a recombination
block [50]. When more than one recombination blocks
were found, we used RecMin [51] as implemented in
SNAP Workbench to estimate the minimum number of
recombination events. Conversely, all sites being compatible with each other were considered as evidence for no
recombination. Sequence polymorphism (haplotype h
and nucleotide π diversities) was estimated using DnaSP
version 5 [52]. Estimates were calculated for the entire
dataset comprising all sequences of one species, as well
as for each subpopulation sampled.
Neutrality tests and population subdivision

Sequence identity, alignments, phylogenetic placement
and variability

To detect potential contaminant sequences, we first
screened our sequences against those available in the
GenBank database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.govhttp:///
[41]) using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
(BLAST). To establish the phylogenetic placement of
the newly generated ITS sequences and those from Garnica et al. [14], we automatically aligned them in
MAFFT v5.7 [42] with the E-INS-i option. Our data
matrix, which included 637 sequences and 739 nucleotide positions, was analysed by ML inference as implemented in RAxML version 7.0.3 [43]. The best-known
likelihood tree under the GTRMIX model of nucleotide
substitution was computed from 100 runs starting from
distinct randomised maximum parsimony starting trees.
A total of 1000 non-parametric bootstrap replicates [44]
were run on the original alignment. Graphical processing of the trees with best likelihood and bootstrapping
were generated using TreeViewPPC version 1.6.6 [45]
and PAUP* 4.0b10 [46]. Subsequently, sequences for
each taxon were aligned separately in MAFFT. Within
each taxon set, all polymorphic sites were rechecked
from the chromatograms. Isolates from fungal specimens are n + n and therefore provide ambiguous haplotype data for heterozygotes. Heterozygous sites appear
as two coincident peaks at the same site in the forward
and reverse sequence chromatograms. To resolve the
haplotype structure within the heterozygote, we used
Clark’s haplotype subtraction algorithm [47]. The DNA

Identical ITS sequences were collapsed into haplotypes
using SNAP Map [49] after excluding indels and infinite-site violations. Site compatibility matrices were generated from each haplotype datasets using SNAP Clade
and Matrix [53]. Sequence variations were tested for
deviations from neutrality by using Tajima’s D [54], Fu
and Li’s D* and F* [55], and Fu’s Fs [56] statistics with
DNASP v 5.00.07 [52]. Tests of neutrality assume a constant population size, no recombination and no migration. The D* test by Fu and Li is based on assessing
selection by counting external (recent) and internal
(ancient) mutations in the genealogy and comparing the
values to their expectations under the assumption of
neutral evolution. Significant Fu and Li’s tests suggest
background selection, while a significant Fu’s Fs value
indicates population growth and genetic hitchhiking. As
small sample sizes and population subdivisions are
known to limit the power of the neutrality tests [57,58],
we subsequently tested our data for population subdivision. To test for population genetic differentiation, we
used SNAP Map [49] to generate the appropriate
sequence file, Septomatrix to convert the sequence file
to a distance matrix, and Permtest [57] to test for geographic intraspecific subdivision among the different
areas sampled, as implemented in SNAP Workbench
[48]. Population genetic differentiation analyses were
calculated according to the sampled areas in Central
America (CR = Costa Rica), Pacific USA (WA =
Washington State, OR = Oregon, CA = California),
Mountain USA (WY = Wyoming, CO = Colorado) and

Europe (EU). In order to increase sample sizes, populations were grouped into macro-populations with regard
to the directions of migration hypothesized as follows:
for C. arcuatorum, these were Costa Rica (CR) + Pacific
(CA) + Mountain USA (WY); for C. aureofulvus, these
were Pacific USA (WA) + Mountain USA (WY, CO);
for C. elegantior, Pacific (WA, OR) + Mountain USA
(WY); for C. napus, Pacific USA (WA, OR) + Mountain
USA (WY, CO). Each macro-population was compared
against the EU macro-population. The main criteria
used to define the macro-populations were: geographical
location of the sampling sites, geological events and host
tree histories. Alternatively, population samples were
analysed as follows: for C. arcuatorum in Central America (CR) + Pacific (CA) macro-populations was compared against Mountain USA (WY, CO) + Europe (EU)
macro-populations, whereas in C. aureofulvus and C.
elegantior Pacific USA (WA, OR) macro-populations
were compared against Mountain USA (WY) + Europe
(EU) macro-populations. Hudson’s test statistics were
evaluated under the null hypothesis of no genetic differentiation applying, 1,000 permutations per species sample. For this purpose only, we used the non-reduced
datasets containing the recombination blocks (see
above), as recombination has been shown to improve
the power of Hudson’s test [57].

simulations of the chain (starting from different random
number seeds for each) and evaluated the estimated
means of migration rates m 1 and m2 . Subsequently, a
one-sided t-test was used to statistically assess the
hypothesis of directional migration between the two
subpopulations.

Haplotype network analyses

Distribution of phenotypic features among populations

We constructed haplotype networks by using the program TCS version 1.21 [59]. Parsimony probability was
set at 95%; therefore, haplotypes with a probability of
parsimony higher than 95% would be connected and
those with a probability lower than 95% would be
unlinked.

To evaluate the distribution of morphological and
macrochemical features of the basidiomata of the populations used in this study, we analysed the macro- and
microscopical morphological structures in detail, as well
as analysing the macrochemical reactions with KOH following standard procedures. Shape, measurement and
colour of the microscopic features were obtained from
dried specimens by mounting them in 3% KOH. Measurements of basidiospores (n = 51) are given as length
and breadth, where the values in brackets represent the
uncommon extremes. Basidiospore length/width quotient (Q), mean and standard deviation values were
calculated.

Migration analysis

For those species showing significant population subdivision according to Hudson’s test, we conducted migration analysis using the IM program [60]. As the
program model assumes neutrality and no recombination, the reduced dataset that contained non-recombinant characters only was submitted to analysis. This
program simultaneously infers multiple genealogical
parameters like effective population sizes for ancestral
(θ A ) and modern (θ 1 and θ 2 ) populations, time since
divergence between populations (t) and migration rates
(m1 and m2) between two subpopulations using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. We used
chain lengths of 10,000,000 steps for C. elegantior dataset and 20,000,000 steps for C. arcuatorum and C. aureofulvus to guarantee a sufficiently large effective sample
size (ESS), as well as a flat or presumably complete
appearance of the posterior distribution curve. For each
dataset, we executed a total of 15 independent

Genealogical analyses

Ancestral intraspecific genealogies were inferred using
Genetree Version 9 [61] in SNAP Workbench [48]. The
genealogies with the highest root probability, ages of
mutations, the times to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA), and geographic distribution of the mutations were assessed from coalescent simulations.
Coalescent simulations were carried out assuming an
infinite-site model, constant size and population subdivision. As for the previous analyses, a reduced dataset was
used that lacked incompatible and recombinant sites to
meet the model assumptions. The backward migration
matrix was set up by averaging the backward migration
rate estimates obtained from the preceding IM simulations. Genealogical analyses for each species were estimated using 4,000,000 steps per coalescent simulation.
For the most likely tree topology two independent runs
using different starting seeds were executed, both resulting in the same topology.
