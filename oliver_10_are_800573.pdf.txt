Are mimics monophyletic? The necessity of
phylogenetic hypothesis tests in character
evolution
Jeffrey C Oliver*, Kathleen L Prudic

Abstract
Background: The processes governing the origin and maintenance of mimetic phenotypes can only be
understood in a phylogenetic framework. Phylogenetic estimates of evolutionary relationships can provide a
context for analyses of character evolution; however, when phylogenetic estimates conflict, rigorous analyses of
alternative evolutionary histories are necessary to determine the likelihood of a specific history giving rise to the
observed pattern of diversity. The polyphenic butterfly Limenitis arthemis provides a case in point. This species is
comprised of three lineages, two of which are mimetic and one of which is non-mimetic. Conflicting estimates of
the relationships among these three lineages requires direct evaluation of the alternative hypotheses of mimicry
evolution.
Results: Using a coalescent framework, we found support for a sister-taxon relationship between the non-mimetic
L. a. arthemis and the mimetic L. a. astyanax, congruent with the previous hypothesis that the non-mimetic form
of L. a. arthemis was derived from a mimetic ancestor. We found no support for a mimetic clade (L. a. astyanax +
L. a. arizonensis) despite analyzing numerous models of population structure.
Conclusions: These results provide the foundation for future studies of mimicry, which should integrate
phylogenetic and developmental analyses of wing pattern formation. We propose future analyses of character
evolution accommodate conflicting phylogenetic estimates by explicitly testing alternative evolutionary hypotheses.

Background
Batesian mimicry and the conditions favoring its origin
and maintenance have provided insight to the process of
natural selection. Central to our understanding of Batesian mimicry is the evolutionary fate of mimics in the
absence of their model. That is, once a profitable species
evolves to mimic an unprofitable Batesian model, what
happens in time or space when the model is not present? The Batesian mimic could persist in locations
without its model, especially when predation is weak
[1,2]. A mimic could also go extinct in these locations
due to intense predation [2]. Or the mimic could evolve
a new color pattern to mimic another model species or
revert back to its ancestral, non-mimetic phenotype
[3,4].

Empirical phylogenetic trees are estimations, or
hypotheses, of the true evolutionary history of a given
group, based on a fit to observed data (morphological
characters, DNA sequences, etc.). Such trees can be
used as a “best estimate” for studies of character evolution, especially when trees based on different analyses
and data converge on the same estimate of evolutionary
relationships. But how to proceed with analyses of character evolution when phylogenetic estimates conflict
with one another? One approach is to compare trees on
the basis of some objective function (number of parsimony steps, likelihood, Bayesian posterior probability,
etc.), and simply interpret the tree with the best score as
the true evolutionary history. However, because empirical phylogenetic tree estimates do not always reflect true
evolutionary history [5,6], inferring a “best estimate” tree
does not eliminate the possibility that an alternative evolutionary history gave rise to the observed pattern of
character data. By way of analogy, comparing trees

based on an objective function alone is similar to comparing the means of two population variables to assess
whether the distributions of the variables are different
between the two populations. Comparisons between
means, and trees in this case, must account for the
potential variation in the underlying distributions which
gave rise to the observed data.
The necessity of evaluating support for alternative
phylogenetic hypotheses has been recognized for some
time [7], but has not yet become common practice.
Methodological limitations and the stochastic nature of
molecular evolution may contribute to misleading phylogenetic estimates [8], so when trees conflict, one must
account for the possibility that an alternative phylogeny
underlies the history that generated the observed data.
However, unlike the analogy with means presented
above, evolutionary inferences are constrained to a single observation, so there is no empirical measure of variance in observed data. Parametric bootstrapping [9,10]
can be used to simulate expected distributions of data
corresponding to specific evolutionary hypotheses (e.g.
trees). These distributions are then compared with
observed data to assess the relative support for alternative phylogenies. Alternative hypotheses in which the
expected distribution does not match observed data are
rejected; when observed data fall within the expected
distribution, those alternative hypotheses remain plausible, and must be accounted for in hypotheses of character evolution.
The butterfly genus Limenitis (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera:
Nymphalidae) has long been a model for the study of
Batesian mimicry and is an ideal system to employ phylogenetic hypothesis testing. Three of the four North
American species include populations which are Batesian mimics of distasteful models [11-14]. Limenitis
arthemis (Drury) includes two populations, L. a. astyanax (Fabricius) and L. a. arizonensis Edwards, which are
mimics of the distasteful model Battus philenor (L.)
(Lepidoptera: Papilionidae), and a non-mimetic population, L. a. arthemis (Drury), characterized by a disruptive non-mimetic wing pattern [12,15]. The distribution
of the phenotypes (mimetic or non-mimetic) is predicted by the distribution of the model species’ host
plants (Aristolochia spp.), which limits the distribution
of the model [4]. Although gene flow occurs between
the mimetic L. a. astyanax and the non-mimetic L. a.
arthemis [15,16], differing selection pressures in the presence and absence of the model species presumably
maintains the polymorphism in wing phenotypes [15].
The origin of the mimetic phenotype, as well as that of
the non-mimetic wing pattern of L. a. arthemis has elicited recent attention [4,17].
Multi-locus DNA sequence estimates of North American Limenitis relationships posit that the mimetic L. a.

Page 2 of 8

arizonensis diverged from a lineage which eventually
gave rise to the mimetic L. a. astyanax and the nonmimetic L. a. arthemis [4,18]. Additionally, explicit
hypothesis tests based on mitochondrial DNA sequences
rejected the hypothesis that the mimetic lineages L. a.
astyanax and L. a. arizonensis form a clade [4]. The
topology of such a relationship suggests that mimicry
either evolved once, and was subsequently lost in the
lineage ultimately leading to L. a. arthemis, or was
gained two times, once in L. a. astyanax and once in
L. a. arizonensis [18]. Based on these phylogenetic estimates and tests, along with the biogeography of
L. arthemis and the model B. philenor, Prudic & Oliver
[4] advocated the hypothesis that the mimetic phenotype evolved in the ancestral L. arthemis lineage and
was subsequently lost in L. a. arthemis after the divergence of L. a. arthemis and L. a. astyanax (figure 1a)
[18]. A recent phylogeny based on AFLP data challenges
this view [17]. Based on a distance analysis of eleven
individuals, the authors [17] proposed that the mimetic
lineages are sister taxa, and that the mimetic phenotype
arose only once in the L. arthemis lineage and was not
subsequently lost (figure 1b). These two conflicting
hypotheses beg the question: which evolutionary process
best explains the observed data? Is a loss of mimicry a
plausible explanation for the observed wing diversity?
Here we evaluate support for the two hypotheses of
wing pattern evolution in Limenitis arthemis by performing explicit phylogenetic hypothesis tests. The first
hypothesis, the reversion hypothesis (figure 1a) posits
that L. a. astyanax and L. a. arthemis are sister taxa,
while the second, the monophyletic mimic hypothesis,
asserts that the mimetic L. a. astyanax and L. a. arizonensis form a clade (figure 1b). We employed a parametric bootstrapping approach, using coalescent
simulations of population structure to determine which
evolutionary histories would be most likely to produce
the observed pattern of genetic diversity. Simulating
data under various models based on previous studies
[16], we assess the support for the two hypotheses of L.
arthemis wing pattern evolution. With these results in
hand, we discuss the relative likelihood of the gain and
loss of mimetic phenotypes in L. arthemis. The analyses
demonstrate the power of explicit phylogenetic hypothesis tests and provide exciting directions for the future
study of mimicry evolution.

Methods
To test the two hypotheses of wing pattern evolution
(figure 1), we used gene tree estimates from eight
nuclear loci (see Gene tree sources below) combined
with coalescent simulations of gene trees to evaluate
support for a variety of models of population structure.
We compared the observed value of two statistics (see

Figure 1 Two hypotheses of mimicry evolution in Limenitis arthemis lineages. In the reversion hypothesis (a), mimetic L. a. astyanax is sister
to non-mimetic L. a. arthemis. Under this hypothesis, the mimetic phenotype arose in the ancestor to all L. arthemis and was subsequently lost
in the L. a. arthemis lineage. In (a), T1 is the divergence time of L. a. arthemis and L. a. astyanax and T2 is the divergence time of L. a. arizonensis
from the lineage giving rise to L. a. arthemis and L. a. astyanax. In the monophyletic mimic hypothesis (b), the mimetic lineages L. a. astyanax
and L. a. arizonensis are sister taxa. T1 is the divergence time of L. a. astyanax and L. a. arizonensis and T2 is the divergence of L. a. arthemis from
the lineage giving rise to the mimetic lineages.

Model evaluation below), to distributions of these statistics based on simulated gene trees. Correspondence
between observed and simulated values of the test statistics were used as measures of support for or against a
particular model of evolution.
Gene tree sources

We included gene tree estimates for eight nuclear loci
from previous studies [4,16,18]: four protein-coding loci
(elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1a), wingless (wg), kettin,
and lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh)) and four anonymous
loci (Anon6, Anon10, Anon15, and Anon17) (GenBank
accession numbers available in Additional File 1). We
used the consensus of Bayesian MCMC searches for
each locus (Additional Files 2 and 3) for calculating
observed values of test statistics.
For simulated gene trees, we used coalescent simulations performed in the software package MS [19]. For
each simulation replicate, we simulated eight gene trees,
with one tree each corresponding to the sampling effort
represented by the observed gene trees. That is, for each
of eight nuclear loci, we simulated a gene tree with the
same number of individuals sampled from each of the
six lineages included in this study (table 1).
Models of Limenitis evolution

We evaluated 15 models of population structure, twelve
models corresponding to the hypothesis that the two

mimetic lineages, L. astyanax and L. arizonensis, are
monophyletic (’MM’ models, figure 1b), and three models corresponding to the reversion hypothesis, in which
the mimetic L. a. astyanax is most closely related to the
non-mimetic L. a. arthemis (’R’ models, figure 1a). For
each model being tested, we used parameter estimates
from previous analyses and mitochondrial DNA divergences (table 2) (Additional File 2). The MM models
included three divergence time estimates for the split of
L. a. arthemis from the lineage leading to L. a. astyanax
and L. a. arizonensis, each of which included two divergence time estimates of L. a. astyanax and L. a. arizonensis. These six models were each evaluated under two
estimated migration rates, based on previously published
analyses [16]. ‘Moderate’ migration models used the
maximum likelihood estimates of population migration
rates (measured in number of migrants per generation):
3.2 L. a. astyanax to L. a. arthemis and 0.14 L. a. arthemis to L. a. astyanax. ‘High’ migration models used the
maximum of the 90% posterior density intervals: 17.71
L. a. astyanax to L. a. arthemis and 15.53 L. a. arthemis
to L. a. astyanax. The three R models differed from one
another only in their estimated divergence time between
L. a. arthemis and L. a. astyanax. All 15 models had
identical divergence time estimates for the three remaining North American Limenitis species (Additional Files
2 and 4), and all models included hybridization between
L. a. arthemis and L. a. astyanax beginning 12,000 ybp,

following the recession of the Laurentide ice sheet [20].
Additionally, the effective population size of each lineage
was 2.5 million individuals, all lineages had two generations per year, and the ancestral lineage that gave rise to
the three lineages of L. arthemis had an effective population size of 350,000, based on previous estimates [16].
Model evaluation

Each model was evaluated for two criteria, each corresponding to a particular test statistic: (1) the relative fit
of the simulated data to the two hypotheses of evolution
in L. arthemis (figure 1) and (2) the absolute fit of the
simulated data to the species tree topology being tested.
Support for models was determined by whether the
simulated distribution of the test statistics reflected as
good or better fit to hypotheses as observed in empirical
data. The first test statistic, δ, measuring the relative fit
of the gene trees to the two hypotheses of L. arthemis,
was calculated as the difference in the minimum number of deep coalescences [21] between a species tree in

which L. a. arthemis and L. a. astyanax are sister taxa
and a species tree in which L. a. arizonensis and L. a.
astyanax are sister taxa (figure 2). For the eight nuclear
loci included in this study, a species tree with L. a.
astyanax sister to L. a. arthemis provided a better fit
than did a species tree with L. a. astyanax sister to L. a.
arizonensis (93 versus 108 deep coalescences, respectively). The observed value of the test statistic δ is thus
93-108 = -15, reflecting a better fit of the L. a. arthemis +
L. a. astyanax tree (figure 1a) to the observed sequence
data.
As a second metric of support for the models of Limenitis evolution, we calculated the minimum number of
deep coalescences under a species tree corresponding to
the topology of the model being tested. That is, for MM
models, we calculated the minimum number of deep
coalescences in a species tree with a L. a. arizonensis +
L. a. astyanax, while for R models, we calculated the
minimum number of deep coalescences in a species tree
with L. a. arthemis + L. a. astyanax. It is important to
note that the two test statistics (the difference in the
number of deep coalescences, δ, and the absolute number of deep coalescences) are not independent, but both
are necessary to measure support for each model. The
former is necessary to evaluate if, under a particular
model, one topological relationship is better supported
than another, while second is used to determine if the
simulated gene trees have been generated under models
that could represent the true evolutionary history. Only
models in which the observed values of both test statistics fell within the 95% simulated distributions were
considered supported. Models in which the 95% simulated distribution did not include observed values were
rejected. All statistics were calculated using the Mesquite software system [22].

Results
A summary of the support for each model is shown in
table 3 and Additional Files 5 and 6. None of the twelve
models of a mimetic clade within L. arthemis corresponding to the monophyletic mimic hypothesis

Figure 2 Description of two statistics used in this study. In the first step (1), one gene tree is sampled for each locus; for observed data,
these would be estimated gene trees or trees sampled from a posterior distribution; for simulated data, trees for each locus would be simulated
under identical models of population structure. These trees, one from each locus, are then fit into each of the hypotheses being tested (2). The
measure of fit for the sampled gene trees is calculated for each species tree hypothesis (3); in this case, the minimum number of deep
coalescences is used to measure the absolute fit of gene trees to each species trees. Finally, the difference in the two measures of absolute fit is
used as the relative measure of fit to the two hypotheses being tested (4).

Simulated values of test statistics for each of the fifteen models evaluated in
this study. δ is the measure of relative fit of the model to the two hypotheses
(figures 1 and 2); while Deep Coalescences measures the absolute fit of the
simulated gene trees to the model tree used for simulation. Values in bold
indicate observed value of statistic fell within the 95% simulated distribution.
P-values represent probability that simulated gene trees fit hypotheses as well
or better than observed data. See text and table 2 for details of analyses.

(MM models) were supported as none of these models
produced simulated results which fulfilled both criteria
for support. All MM models produced gene trees with
poorer fit for a species tree with L. a. astyanax sister to
L. a. arthemis than observed in empirical gene trees.
That is, values for δ were consistently higher in MM
models than our observed value of δ = -15, although for
some MM models the 95% simulated distribution of the
absolute fit (minimum number of deep coalescences)
did include observed values (models MM3-MM6, MM9MM12).
Of the three models corresponding to the reversion
hypothesis (R models), only one, R2, was supported by
both criteria. This model produced gene trees which fit
a L. a. arthemis + L. a. astyanax tree as well as observed
data, and the absolute fit to this species tree matched
the observed gene trees. One model, R1, with a very
recent divergence of L. a. arthemis and L. a. astyanax,
produced gene trees which showed a significantly better
fit to a L. a. astyanax + L. a. arthemis species tree than
did the observed gene tree estimates, and thus was not
supported. The divergence of the mimetic from nonmimetic lineage in model R1 was based on the

Oliver and Prudic BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:239
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/239

divergence time estimate of Mullen et al. [16]. Conversely, an older divergence time model, R3, based on
mitochondrial DNA divergences, produced gene trees
which showed a worse fit to a L. a. astyanax + L. a.
arthemis tree than did the observed gene tree estimates.
In models R2 and R3, with L. a. astyanax sister to L. a.
arthemis, the 95% distribution of the absolute fit (the
minimum number of deep coalescences) included the
observed value (table 3).

Discussion
A sister-taxa relationship between non-mimetic L. a.
arthemis and mimetic L. a. astyanax was supported by
our analyses. (table 3, Additional Files 5 and 6). This
topology is expected under the reversion hypotheses, in
which the mimetic form evolved once and was subsequently lost in L. a. arthemis (figure 1a) [4]. The only
model to fulfill both criteria, R2, corresponds to a sistertaxa relationship between L. a. arthemis and L. a. astyanax, with a divergence between the two approximately
0.66 mya (table 2). Our analyses failed to support the
hypothesis that the mimetic lineages of L. arthemis form
a clade (figure 1b). In all monophyletic mimic models
analyzed, gene trees predicted a worse relative fit to a
species tree with L. a. astyanax sister to L. a. arthemis
than the observed data. That is, the difference in the
number of deep coalescences between the two model
trees was less for simulated gene trees from any MM
model than observed in empirical gene tree estimates
(Additional File 5). Even in models with a high migration
rate between L. a. astyanax and L. a. arthemis (MM7MM12), which would increase the fit of the gene trees to
a L. a. astyanax + L. a. arthemis species tree, the simulated distribution of δ was still significantly higher than
the observed value (table 3, Additional File 5). The available phylogenetic data and population parameter estimates [4,16] do not support the hypothesis that mimetic
lineages of L. arthemis are sister taxa [17] and, along with
previous studies [4,18], indicate that L. a. astyanax is
likely sister to the non-mimetic L. a. arthemis.
There are a variety of reasons why the results of this
and prior studies [4,18] conflict with the AFLP estimate
in [17], including the high potential for homoplasy
among AFLP markers [23]. Additionally, the lack of
applicable evolutionary models to AFLP markers and
dependence on distance-based estimates of phylogeny
may result in inconsistent estimates of phylogeny, especially when terminal branches are connected by relatively short internodes [23-25]. Finally, phylogenetic
estimates with low taxon sampling may be prone to
inconsistency, especially when markers used for estimation are evolving relatively rapidly [26]. Alternatively,
published estimates of model parameters [16] used in
simulations may not accurately reflect the true history

of this group, and thus the models we evaluated did not
encompass sufficient parameter space. More complex
parametric models, tests accommodating uncertainty in
gene tree estimates [27], and increased precision in
population parameters would all benefit our understanding of how mimetic phenotypes arise and change over
time.
Did the white-banded L. a. arthemis evolve from a
mimetic lineage, as proposed in the reversion hypothesis? In light of the phylogenetic tests on multi-locus
data presented here, this remains a plausible explanation
for the observed data. The mimetic phenotype is
hypothesized to have arisen in the lineage which eventually gave rise to all L. arthemis taxa; in areas where
the model, B. philenor was absent, the mimetic phenotype was lost, giving rise to the disruptively colored L. a.
arthemis. Selection against mimetic phenotypes in the
absence of the model is predicted to favor phenotypes
with alternative defensive strategies, such as disruptive
coloration, and may occur in other systems, such as
king snakes [23]. Although it remains possible that the
monophyletic mimic hypothesis [17] is correct, or that
mimicry evolved twice in the L. arthemis lineage [18],
additional data would be needed to support these
hypotheses.
The key to understanding the evolution of mimicry
within this group will require integration of geographical
and developmental approaches. Extensive geographical
sampling and geographically explicit models of population structure will be necessary to determine the extent
of gene flow between L. a. arthemis and L. a. astyanax,
and the degree to which introgression causes discordance between gene trees and species trees. The biogeographical history of all L. arthemis lineages, based on
increased sampling of L. a. arizonensis, along with
detailed history of the model, B. philenor, will be necessary for a better understanding of mimicry evolution [4].
Future work should also couple the phylogenetic estimates of ancestry with a developmental genetic
approach assessing homology among the various
mimetic and non-mimetic phenotypes. The identity and
history of the genetic loci responsible for the respective
phenotypes will prove invaluable in studying the evolution of mimicry [18,28]. This approach will be necessary
to distinguish among the various hypotheses regarding
the history underlying the non-mimetic phenotype of
L. a. arthemis, including, but not limited to: a loss of
function mutation in the mimetic coloration network
resulting in a reversion to an ancestral phenotype; a
gain of function mutation representing novel evolution
of the white-banded phenotype; or a gain of disruptive
coloration via adaptive introgression with other North
American white-banded lineages (L. weidemeyerii,
L. lorquini).

Conclusions
Hypothesis tests based on mitochondrial [4] and nuclear
loci (this study), which explicitly evaluated support for a
mimetic clade within L. arthemis, rejected the hypothesis that L. a. astyanax and L. a. arizonensis are sister
taxa [17] and found support only for a phylogeny consistent with the reversion hypothesis (figure 1a). These
results also demonstrate how studying character evolution requires an understanding of the basis of and limitations to phylogenetic tree estimation. The future of
the comparative approach lies in accommodating deterministic and stochastic processes responsible for the
observed patterns of biological diversity. The possibility
of different processes giving rise to identical patterns
must be accounted for, and the relative support for
those processes can be measured in a quantitative framework as presented here. This study presents a modest
attempt at evaluating the different evolutionary models
of the mimetic phenotype, and the phylogenetic analyses
presented here provide a framework for future investigations of the evolution of mimicry. With the current
computational resources available, studies should move
away from relying solely on phylogenetic point estimates
(e.g., single trees) for comparing processes of character
evolution. Instead, we should use model-based
approaches, such as parametric bootstrapping, to assess
the relative support of alternative evolutionary hypotheses. By comparing the variation underlying the
observed pattern of diversity, we can gain deeper
insights into the likelihood of various evolutionary
processes.
