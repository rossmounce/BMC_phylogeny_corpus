Abstract
Background: Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida is a Gram-negative bacterium that is the
causative agent of furunculosis, a bacterial septicaemia of salmonid fish. While other species of
Aeromonas are opportunistic pathogens or are found in commensal or symbiotic relationships with
animal hosts, A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida causes disease in healthy fish. The genome sequence
of A. salmonicida was determined to provide a better understanding of the virulence factors used
by this pathogen to infect fish.
Results: The nucleotide sequences of the A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida A449 chromosome and
two large plasmids are characterized. The chromosome is 4,702,402 bp and encodes 4388 genes,
while the two large plasmids are 166,749 and 155,098 bp with 178 and 164 genes, respectively.
Notable features are a large inversion in the chromosome and, in one of the large plasmids, the
presence of a Tn21 composite transposon containing mercury resistance genes and an In2 integron
encoding genes for resistance to streptomycin/spectinomycin, quaternary ammonia compounds,
sulphonamides and chloramphenicol. A large number of genes encoding potential virulence factors
were identified; however, many appear to be pseudogenes since they contain insertion sequences,
frameshifts or in-frame stop codons. A total of 170 pseudogenes and 88 insertion sequences (of
ten different types) are found in the A. salmonicida genome. Comparison with the A. hydrophila
ATCC 7966T genome reveals multiple large inversions in the chromosome as well as an
approximately 9% difference in gene content indicating instances of single gene or operon loss or
gain.

A limited number of the pseudogenes found in A. salmonicida A449 were investigated in other
Aeromonas strains and species. While nearly all the pseudogenes tested are present in A. salmonicida
subsp. salmonicida strains, only about 25% were found in other A. salmonicida subspecies and none
were detected in other Aeromonas species.
Conclusion: Relative to the A. hydrophila ATCC 7966T genome, the A. salmonicida subsp.
salmonicida genome has acquired multiple mobile genetic elements, undergone substantial
rearrangement and developed a significant number of pseudogenes. These changes appear to be a
consequence of adaptation to a specific host, salmonid fish, and provide insights into the
mechanisms used by the bacterium for infection and avoidance of host defence systems.

Background
The genus Aeromonas comprises a collection of Gram-negative bacteria that are widespread in aquatic environments
and that have been implicated as causative agents of a
number of human and animal diseases. A. hydrophila, A.
veronii biovar sobria, A. caviae, A. jandaei, A. veronii biovar
veronii, A. schubertii and A. trota have been associated with
various human infections including gastroenteritis,
wound infections and septicaemia [1]. Aeromonas salmonicida, a non-motile aeromonad, is the aetiological agent of
a bacterial septicaemia in fish, called furunculosis [2-4].
Furunculosis is an important disease in wild and cultured
stocks of salmonid and other fish species and can have significant negative economic impacts on aquaculture operations. Motile Aeromonas species have also been
implicated as the causative agents of various fish septicemias [5]. A. hydrophila is also associated with red leg disease in amphibians and infections in turtles [6] and birds
[7].
In addition to their role as disease agents, Aeromonas species can be found in non-pathogenic association with a
variety of animals [8-10]. Most Aeromonas species are
opportunistic pathogens, entering through wounds or
affecting only stressed or otherwise immunocompromised hosts [1]. A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, however, is a specific pathogen of salmonid fish and is capable
of causing disease in healthy fish at very low levels of
infection (LD50 < 10 cfu by intraperitoneal injection [11]).
Although Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology [12]
recognizes five subspecies of A. salmonicida: salmonicida,
achromogenes, masoucida, smithia, and pectinolytica, many
laboratories currently classify A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida as "typical" and any isolate deviating phenotypically as "atypical". Hosts for atypical strains include a wide
variety of non-salmonid fish, as well as salmonids [4]. On
the basis of DNA relatedness, A. salmonicida also includes
a group of mesophilic, motile strains isolated from
humans [12]. Morphological and biochemical differences
such as pigment production, colony size and growth rate,
haemolysis, and sucrose fermentation [4,13-15] are used
to distinguish typical and atypical isolates. A. salmonicida
subsp. salmonicida (i.e. typical) isolates grow well on

blood agar with large colonies, produce a brown diffusible pigment, are haemolytic and do not ferment sucrose
[12]. Historically, typical strains are thought to be
extremely homogenous [16,17], and therefore any deviation in any of these characteristics has been considered
enough evidence to classify a strain as "atypical" [13].
Phylogenetic analyses based on gene sequences [18,19] or
biochemical analyses based on carbohydrates [20] appear
to be better able to sort out the complex taxonomy and
classification of A. salmonicida subspecies and related species.
A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida appears to be an example
of the evolution of pathogen specificity for a particular
host from within a group of mainly opportunistic pathogens or commensal bacteria. It thus provides opportunities to identify genes involved in host invasion and
virulence and to investigate the evolution of host specificity. In this communication, the genome, including both
the chromosome and large plasmids, of an isolate of A.
salmonicida subsp. salmonicida is characterized. The three
small plasmids of this strain have been described previously [21]. Genes associated with virulence are identified
and comparisons with the genome of A. hydrophila ATCC
7966T [22] provide insights into the changes in the
genome that may be associated with adaptation to fish
hosts. The genome sequence is an essential tool for the
understanding of the infection process of A. salmonicida.

Results and discussion
Genome features
The genome of A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida A449
(hereon A449) consists of a single circular chromosome,
two large plasmids and three small plasmids. The
4,702,402 bp chromosome has a G+C content of 58.5%
and contains 4388 genes, with 4086 encoding proteins
(Table 1). Generally, the chromosome matches the restriction map previously constructed for this strain [23],
although there are differences in the placement of some
genes. The chromosome has a number of major structural
features. The origin of replication (oriC), as inferred from
the presence of multiple DnaA binding sites and GC skew,
occurs at 4666400 – 4666750, which is approximately

35,700 bp from dnaA (Fig. 1). Replication terminates near
2134850 as judged by GC skew and the presence of a diflike sequence, which has been recently implicated as the
DNA replication terminus [24]. GC skew also detected the
presence of a large inversion (3963279 – 4158772) that
appears to have occurred between two identical insertion
sequences. PCR analysis confirmed that this inversion was
not due to misassembly of the sequence (not shown). In
addition, two prophages have been detected by similarity
to phage genes (Fig. 1, red arrows), but these regions of
the chromosome do not show any obvious alteration in
G+C content.
Twenty-eight ribosomal RNA genes are encoded on the
chromosome, arranged in nine operons, with one operon
containing an extra copy of the 5S rRNA gene (Table 1;
Fig. 1, light blue arrows). The nine operons are arranged
around the origin of replication so as to be transcribed in
the same direction as replication proceeds. Small variations (1 – 3 bp) in sequence occur between the copies of
the rRNA genes, with only the "extra" 5S rRNA gene
(rrfG1) having 6 bp that vary when compared to the other
copies. A total of 110 tRNA genes are encoded on the
A449 chromosome, most of which are present in at least
two copies, and some of which occur in clusters of multiple tandem copies, similar to the A. hydrophila genome
[22]. There are single genes for tryptophan (trnW) and
selenocysteine tRNAs as well as a suppressor tRNA that
translates TAG codons as tryptophan. This suppressor
tRNA differs from the trnW sequence at only two bases,
one of which is in the anticodon. Twenty-one protein coding genes appear to use the suppressor tRNA to allow the
translation of the encoded protein. Analysis of the
genome to identify small non-coding RNA features that
regulate gene expression by binding to RNA or proteins
[25] revealed the presence of nine small RNAs. In addition, 11 riboswitches, which regulate translation through
the detection of small molecules [26], were detected near
the 5' ends of genes they presumably regulate.

Two striking aspects of the A449 genome are the presence
of large numbers of insertion sequences (IS) (n = 88) and
pseudogenes (n = 170) on the chromosome and two large
plasmids. Ten different types of IS are found in multiple
copies in the A449 genome (Table 2) with ISAs7 present
in 37 complete copies. One IS previously identified in
Aeromonas species (ISAs4) [27] is not present in the A449
genome. In addition to the 88 complete IS elements, 14
partial IS sequences are present. This observation along
with the finding that some IS are located within other IS,
suggests that these dynamic elements have undergone
recent transposition. Insertion sequences have also contributed to the apparent formation of pseudogenes, with
more than 20 genes being interrupted by IS elements.
Most pseudogenes, however, are created by small (1–37
bp) deletions or sequence duplications, although several
genes have larger deletions. Additional pseudogenes
appear to have arisen through mutations that introduce
in-frame stop codons (TAA or TGA, but not TAG, due to
the suppressor tRNA). These observations are in marked
contrast to the A. hydrophila genome [22], which has no IS
elements and only seven pseudogenes.
Both large plasmids contain genes involved in replication,
plasmid partition and conjugative transfer. Plasmid 4
(pAsa4) carries an origin of replication that can be propagated in E. coli, since this plasmid was isolated by transformation of E. coli with a plasmid DNA extract from A449.
This plasmid also contains a Tn21 composite transposon
(bases 78182 – 101330) [28] that carries genes for resistance to mercury as well as an In2 integron encoding resistance
to
streptomycin/spectinomycin,
quaternary
ammonia compounds, sulphonamides and chloramphenicol (Fig. 2, brown bar). The Tn21 sequence has a
considerably higher G+C content (61.43%) than the
remainder of the plasmid (52.18%), as well as noticeable
differences in stacking energy and position preference, as
expected for a transposon.

The most notable aspect of the other large plasmid, pAsa5,
is the presence of genes for a type III secretion system
(T3SS) (Fig. 2, orange bar; Table 3) that has been shown
to be required for virulence in A. salmonicida [29,30]. The
36 genes encoding the T3SS needle apparatus and regulatory proteins are organized identically to those described

[32], AH-1 [33]and SSU [34]. As well, three presumptive
effector proteins (AopH, AopO, Ati2) and their associated
chaperones (SycH, SycO, Ati1) are located on pAsa5
(Table 3). Two of the effector proteins AopH and AopO
(ASA_P5G009 and ASA_P5G098) show significant similarity to Yersinia YopH and YopO, and thus are expected
to encode a protein tyrosine phosphatase and a protein
serine/threonine kinase, respectively [30]. A third effector,
Ati2 (ASA_P5G045), was identified by the presence of its
chaperone (Ati1 (ASA_P5G046)) [35] and its similarity to

hypothetical proteins in the T3SS operons of Photorhabdus
luminescens and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. On the basis of
conserved domain structure, this effector appears to have
inositol polyphosphate phosphatase activity. A fourth,
well-characterized effector, AexT (ASA_4266) [36,37], is
encoded on the chromosome. Two pseudogenes also
appear to encode T3SS effectors: ASA_0010 is located on
the chromosome and is disrupted by an in-frame TAA
stop codon; ASA_P5G084 is located on pAsa5 and is disrupted by a 20 bp duplication that results in a frameshift.
Genes encoding presumptive T3SS chaperones are adjacent to both pseudogenes. The A449 genome does not
include the AopP effector found in several A. salmonicida
subsp. salmonicida strains including JF2267and ATCC
33658T [38].
Genes for a type VI secretion system (T6SS), which is also
involved in the transfer of bacterial proteins into host
cells, are encoded on the A449 chromosome (ASA_2455
– ASA_2470) (Table 3). These 16 proteins show high similarity to T6SS proteins from A. hydrophila, P. aeruginosa
and other Gram-negative bacteria. Three additional genes
usually associated with this operon are encoded on pAsa4
(ASA_P4G080 – ASA_P4G082). However, a key T6SS
gene is interrupted in A449: the gene encoding IcmF
(ASA_2458) contains a 5 bp deletion and is fused to the
upstream coding sequence in the operon. In addition, two
proteins transported by the T6SS are disrupted: a partial
VgrG homolog is fused to a transposon subunit
(ASA_2455), although a complete vgrG gene is encoded
on pAsa4 (ASA_P4G080), and Hcp, which is encoded on
pAsa4 (ASA_P4G082), is interrupted by an insertion
sequence into which the Tn21 element has inserted. These
gene disruptions are in contrast to A. hydrophila where the
T6SS genes are uninterrupted and a functional T6SS has
been demonstrated [39]. Since deletion of the A.
hydrophila icmF homolog (vasK) blocks T6SS secretion
[39], the A449 T6SS is unlikely to be functional. The presence of defects in two T3SS effectors and the T6SS suggests
that A449 could be considerably more virulent, since
functional versions of these genes would provide additional means to manipulate the response of the host.
A notable aspect of the T3SS and T6SS is the location of
genes for these systems on both the chromosome and the

large plasmids. For the T3SS, most of the genes are
encoded on pAsa5, although one functional effector gene,
aexT, and a putative effector pseudogene (ASA_0010), as
well as their T3SS chaperone protein genes (ASA_4267,
ASA_0011), are encoded on the chromosome. In A.
hydrophila ATCC 7966T, T3SS genes are absent, while
other A. hydrophila strains carry T3SS operons on the chromosome [32-34]. The ancestral state of the T3SS in the
genus Aeromonas is thus unclear, making it difficult to surmise how it ended up in two locations in A449. The T6SS
situation is somewhat reversed, with the majority of genes
located on the chromosome, but with three genes located
on pAsa4. Since A. hydrophila has a complete, intact T6SS
on the chromosome, one might infer that these genes
were transferred to pAsa4 following the acquisition of that
plasmid, but prior to the capture of the Tn21 element.
Adhesins
Genes for several types of adhesins (e.g., surface layer,
flagella, pili), which are important in host cell attachment
and entry, are present in the A449 genome (Table 3). The
abundant surface layer protein VapA (ASA_1438) [40],
which has been implicated as an important virulence factor in several studies [41-43], is located downstream from
an operon for a VapA-specific type II secretion system
(ASA_1427 – ASA_1437). The identification of these
genes as a VapA secretion system is based the observation
that disruption of spsE (ASA_1427) blocks VapA secretion
[44] and that many of the genes in this operon show some
similarity to genes of the general secretion pathway (exeAN). In the same region of the genome are multiple carbohydrate synthesis and modification genes (ASA_1422 –
ASA_1426, ASA_1441 – ASA_1459) that appear to be
involved in the synthesis of lipopolysaccharide, which
anchors the surface layer to the cell. The genes involved in
VapA synthesis and secretion have an unusually low G+C
content that can be seen in Fig. 1 at approximately base
1500000 (Fig. 1, brown arrow).

Complete sets of genes for two types of flagella, lateral and
polar, are also encoded in the A449 genome. The genes for
lateral flagella are found in a single cluster (ASA_0346 –
ASA_0386) but include two disrupted genes: lafA, encoding the lateral flagellin, which has been shown previously
to be interrupted by an insertion sequence [45], and lfgD,

Page 7 of 15

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:427

encoding the lateral flagellar hook-capping protein,
which has a 1 bp deletion. The genes for the polar flagella
are dispersed around the genome in multiple operons
(ASA_1336 – ASA_1360, ASA_1484 – ASA_1499,
ASA_1505 – ASA_1507, ASA_2656 – ASA_2662), but also
include interrupted genes: flgL (ASA_1499), encoding a
flagellar hook-associated protein, has a 5 bp duplication;
flrA (ASA_1505), encoding a transcriptional activator,
contains a 13 bp deletion; and, maf1 (ASA_2656), encoding a motility accessory factor [46] has a 1 bp deletion.
The disruption of genes involved in the production of
both types of flagella suggests that neither structure can be
synthesized, which is consistent with the characterization
of A. salmonicida as non-motile.
An additional class of adhesins, the pili, is well-represented in the A449 genome with genes for four different
pili (three type IV, one type I) distributed throughout the
genome. The type I pilus operon (ASA_3725 – ASA_3730)
appears to be complete and intact. However, for each of
three types of type IV pili [47], there are frameshifted
genes encoding proteins involved in pilin assembly (tap,
flp) or a multiple gene deletion (msh) (Table 3). Nevertheless, a mutant deleted for tapA showed reduced virulence
when delivered by immersion, but not by intraperitoneal
injection, suggesting a role for the Tap pilus in host invasion [47].
Toxins
Another class of putative virulence factors are pore-forming toxins that create channels in host membranes resulting in cell lysis (Table 3). Aerolysin, one of the earliest
virulence factors to be discovered among Aeromonas spp.
[48], is represented by two genes in the A449 genome:
ASA_3906, which encodes the classical aerolysin [48], and
ASA_2854, which encodes a conserved hemolysin found
in other Aeromonas species, Vibrio species and Listonella
anguillarum. A large (9588 bp) gene, asx (ASA_0826),
encodes an RTX (repeats in toxin) protein, homologs of
which are important virulence determinants in a range of
Gram-negative bacteria [49]. The A449 genome also
encodes a cytolytic delta-endotoxin (ASA_2128) that is
61% similar to the Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal toxin
CryET29 (Genbank accession AAK50455), which may be
an indication of interaction with invertebrates. Two additional genes (ASA_2003 and ASA_2015) encode proteins
that are 53 and 44% similar to the zonula occludens toxin
(Zot) of Colwellia psychrerythraea (Genbank accession
YP_267119). Zot was first described in Vibrio cholerae as a
toxin that transiently loosens intracellular tight junctions
in the intestinal mucosa [50]. In V. cholerae, Zot is associated with cholera toxin A and B and is also encoded on the
CTXΦ plasmid [50]. In A449, however, both genes are
interrupted, either by an IS (ASA_2015) or by a single bp

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/427

insertion (ASA_2003), suggesting that functional proteins
can not be synthesized from them.
Secreted enzymes
An additional class of potential virulence factors in A. salmonicida are extracellular enzymes, some of which have
been previously investigated (Table 3). Among secreted
proteases are a serine protease previously tested for its
contribution to virulence (ASA_2540) [51], a zinc metalloprotease (TagA, ASA_3321) implicated in complement
inhibition [52], another secreted metalloprotease
(ASA_1723) and a microbial collagenase (ASA_3723). A
gene encoding an extracellular endopeptidase (AsaP1,
ASA_1660) contributing to virulence in atypical A. salmonicida strains [53] is present, but interrupted by a single bp
insertion. The phospholipases encoded by satA (glycerophospholipid cholesterol acyltransferase, ASA_0509), pla
(phospholipase A1, ASA_4288) and plc (phospholipase
C, ASA_0635) have been investigated for their role in virulence in A. salmonicida [51] and A. hydrophila [54]. Extracellular nucleases (ASA_1199, ASA_2206), amylases
(ASA_1286, ASA_3455), pullulanase (ASA_0628) and
chitinases (ASA_0873, ASA_2142, ASA_3320) may also
contribute to A449 virulence. All of these enzymes have a
predicted Sec-dependent signal sequence and are expected
to be secreted via the type II secretion system (exeA-N,
ASA_0514–0515, ASA_3777–3785) [55,56].
Antibiotic resistance
In addition to the antibiotic resistance genes encoded in
the Tn21 element, pAsa4 also carries genes for tetracycline
resistance: tetA(E) (ASA_P4G005) encodes a class E tetracycline efflux pump that is presumably regulated by the
adjacent class E tetracycline repressor protein (tetR(E),
ASA_P4G005). Three β-lactamase genes, ampC
(ASA_1191), ampS (ASA_4346) and cphA (ASA_3612),
previously described in A. sobria (as cepS, ampS and imiS,
respectively) [57] are carried on the A449 chromosome
(Table 3). The presence of more than 25 genes for multidrug resistance and major facilitator efflux family proteins
indicates that A449 carries an array of genes to counteract
antimicrobials.
Iron acquisition
Iron acquisition is an important virulence factor for many
bacterial pathogens and for A. salmonicida, it may also be
a key process for survival in aquatic environments. Mesophilic Aeromonas species have been found to produce
two types of catecholate siderophores, amonabactin and
enterobactin [58]. When A449 is grown under low iron
conditions, either in vivo or in the presence of 2,2'-dipyridyl, three outer membrane proteins are induced that
appear to be ferric siderophore or heme receptors [59]. On
the A449 chromosome, both of the ferric siderophore
receptors are located adjacent to clusters of genes encod-

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:427

ing ABC-type ferric transporter subunits as well as nonribosomal peptide synthetase modules, suggesting complete systems for siderophore synthesis and uptake. The
gene for the FstC receptor is located within a cluster
(ASA_1838 – ASA_1851) that includes the amonabactin
synthesis gene [60], indicating that these genes are likely
involved in the synthesis and uptake of amonabactin. The
gene for the FstB receptor is encoded in a gene cluster
(ASA_4368 – ASA_4380) that is similar to the Listonella
anguillarum anguibactin and the Acinetobacter baumannii
acinetobactin synthesis genes [61], suggesting that A449
has the ability to synthesize and recapture an anguibactinlike siderophore. Some of the genes in this cluster have
been recently characterized in A. salmonicida and shown to
be required for siderophore synthesis [62]. Adjacent to
this gene cluster are five genes (ASA_4363 – ASA_4367)
encoding a hydroxamate-type ferric siderophore receptor
and an ABC transporter system, indicating that A449 may
also use a hydroxamate siderophore for iron acquisition.
The gene for a presumptive heme receptor, hupA
(ASA_3328), that is induced by low iron conditions [59],
is located near hutZXBCD (ASA_3332 – ASA_ 3336),
which encode proteins involved in heme uptake and utilization [63]. Genes for several additional Ton-B dependent outer membrane receptors that may be involved in
heme or hemoprotein transport are also present in the
A449 genome, but require further characterization to
establish their function.
Quorum sensing
Another bacterial process implicated in virulence is quorum sensing [64]. The A449 chromosome contains the
luxI and luxR homologs, asaI (ASA_3762) and asaR
(ASA_3763), which encode proteins for the synthesis of
the acylhomoserine lactone quorum sensing molecule
and the transcriptional regulator that responds to it,
respectively [65]. In addition, genes for a second quorum
sensing pathway that uses autoinducer-2 [66] are present:
luxS (ASA_0697) encodes the autoinducer-2 synthase,
luxU (ASA_2781) is a putative phosphorelay protein
involved in transduction of the signal and luxO
(ASA_3295) is a transcriptional response regulator (Table
3). Other unidentified genes in the A449 genome may
also participate in these systems since in Vibrio spp. receptor proteins and multiple small RNAs are involved in the
complete signal transduction pathway [67].
Comparison to the A. hydrophila genome
The genome sequence of A. hydrophila ATCC 7966T [22]
provides an excellent basis for comparative sequence analysis leading to enhanced understanding of genome evolution within the genus Aeromonas. A comparative analysis
of the two chromosomes using Mummer [68] is shown in
Fig. 3. Due to an inversion around the origin of replication, the A449 sequence primarily aligns with the A.
hydrophila sequence on the reverse strand (blue line in Fig.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/427

3). As expected for two chromosomes of nearly the same
size, there are no large gap regions indicative of significant
insertions or deletions. Nearly all regions of sequence
similarity fall along one of the diagonals, indicating generally similar gene and sequence order. Approximately 15
large sequence inversions (red lines in Fig. 3) around the
origin of replication have occurred in the A449 chromosome relative to the A. hydrophila chromosome, accounting for the regions of forward strand alignment. The large
inversion already noted in the A449 chromosome, which
appears to be an evolutionarily recent change since it is
bounded by transposons and is absent in A. hydrophila,
stands out as a red line along the blue (reverse strand)
diagonal at 500,000 bp in the A. hydrophila sequence.
On a global scale, the A449 and A. hydrophila chromosomes appear generally similar and encode similar numbers of proteins (4086 in A449, 4128 in A. hydrophila).
However, there are multiple instances of single gene or
operon loss and gain between the two genomes, leading
to a 9% difference in gene content. There are 477 coding
sequences (CDS) present in the A. salmonicida chromosome that are not found on the A. hydrophila chromosome. Many of these are transposon (101 CDS) or phage
related (69 CDS) and 122 represent CDS unique to A. salmonicida. However, there are also 97 conserved hypothetical CDS found in other bacterial species and 88 known
CDS that are present in the A. salmonicida genome, but not
in that of A. hydrophila. Conversely, the A. hydrophila
genome contains 278 CDS not present in A. salmonicida
(72 unique CDS, 67 conserved hypothetical CDS and 139
known CDS). Clearly, significant changes in gene content
have occurred following the separation of these two species.
Pseudogenes
An additional obvious difference between the A. salmonicida and A. hydrophila genomes is the number of pseudogenes present. The A. hydrophila genome [22] has only 7
pseudogenes: 2 in tRNA genes, 2 protein CDS with inframe stop codons and 3 frameshifted protein CDS. Only
one of these CDS (AHA_2264) is present in A. salmonicida
(ASA_2042) and both genes contain the same frameshift.
To investigate the frequency and occurrence of frameshifts
in the genus Aeromonas, we attempted to amplify and
sequence 16 A. salmonicida pseudogenes (Additional file
1) having a variety of lesions from five A. salmonicida
strains (two strains of subspecies salmonicida, one each of
subspecies masoucida, achromogenes and smithia) and from
one strain each of five other Aeromonas species (hydrophila,
veronii, caviae, sobria and bestiarum) (Table 4). In addition,
these sequences were amplified from A449 cDNA to determine whether transcriptional frameshifting corrected any
of them. All the cDNA sequences were identical to the
genomic sequence (Table 4 and Additional file 1). While
most of the genes could be amplified from the A. salmonPage 9 of 15

icida strains and subspecies, the amplification of genes
from the other Aeromonas species was considerably less
successful (Table 4 and Additional file 1), presumably due
to sequence changes at the primer sites. However, it is
clear (Table 4) that in the single species of A. salmonicida
subsp. masoucida, achromogenes and smithia that were
tested, only 3 or 4 of the pseudogenes are present and that
none of the amplified sequences from the other Aeromonas species showed disruptions. While this analysis tests
less than 10% of the A449 pseudogenes and although the
data are incomplete for many of the non-A. salmonicida
species, these pseudogenes appear to be limited to A. salmonicida with the majority present only in A. salmonicida
subsp. salmonicida.
Genomic evidence for pathogen speciation
Analyses of the genomes of bacterial pathogens provide
evidence that three key processes, the acquisition of

mobile genetic elements, genome rearrangements and
gene loss in the process of adapting to a specific host,
result in substantial changes in the genomes of pathogens
(see [69] for a recent review). Since its separation from the
last common ancestor with A. hydrophila, A449 appears to
have acquired multiple plasmids, two prophages, a variety
of IS elements and a number of individual genes and
operons, presumably through horizontal gene transfer.
While mechanisms for the acquisition of prophage, plasmids and insertion sequences are understood, mechanisms for the gain of individual genes, such as the B.
thuringiensis toxin, or operons, such as VapA and its secretion system, are less obvious. The acquisition of foreign
DNA appears to be an ongoing process in A. salmonicida
based on the diversity of plasmids identified in various
strains [70-72]. IS transposition also continues to be
active in A449 since mutants can be generated by IS transposition ([73], JMB unpublished results), usually by

growth under stressful conditions such as elevated temperature (30°C).
Substantial genetic rearrangements have occurred in the
A449 genome, relative to the A. hydrophila genome. Many
of these rearrangements have been assisted by the presence of IS elements, such as the apparent transfer of T6SS
genes to pAsa4 and the large inversion. Most of the other
inversions, relative to A. hydrophila, do not appear to be
associated with IS elements, indicating that other mechanisms are also generating genetic rearrangements. While
these large scale rearrangements do not obviously affect
gene sequences, reorientation of large regions relative to
the origin of replication may impact the regulation of
gene expression.
The third trait of recently evolved pathogen genomes,
gene loss or decay, has also occurred frequently in the
A449 genome. The number of A449 pseudogenes, 170, is
comparable to that seen in Yersinia pestis (~150) [74], but
less than other recently evolved human pathogens such as
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi CT18 (>200) [75] or
Mycobacterium leprae (>1100) [76]. Several of the A449
pseudogenes prevent the expression of cell surface structures such as flagella and pili. Loss of flagellar motility is
common among recently emerged pathogens [69], perhaps as a means to evade the host innate immune system.
Loss of genes for type IV pili is also associated with pathogen speciation [77] and may also help pathogens avoid
innate immune responses [78]. Significant accumulations
of pseudogenes are also found among genes for transcriptional regulators (17 pseudogenes), genes encoding carbohydrate synthesis and modification enzymes (12
pseudogenes) and genes for basic metabolic enzymes
(e.g., sulfite reductase, α and β galactosidase, acetolactate
synthase, etc.) (10 pseudogenes). Compared to A.
hydrophila ATCC 7966T, the "jack of all trades" [22], the
accumulation of pseudogenes in A449 has considerably

reduced its capacity to produce some organelles (e.g., pili
or flagella) and to synthesize some enzymes and their
products.
The A449 genome thus carries all the hallmarks of an
organism that has undergone adaptation to a specific
host. Clearly, substantial horizontal gene transfer,
genome rearrangements and gene decay have occurred in
A449 relative to A. hydrophila ATCC 7966T. The small survey of pseudogenes in other members of the genus Aeromonas suggests that pseudogene accumulation coincided
with the speciation of A. salmonicida but increased substantially during the evolution of the subspecies salmonicida. Further analysis of Aeromonas sequences and genomes
should provide insights into the process and timing of the
evolution of host specialization as well as a better understanding of the genes and proteins involved in virulence.

Conclusion
The genome of A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida A449
consists of a circular chromosome and five plasmids that
encode more than 4700 genes. A large number of genes
encoding potential virulence factors have been identified,
although a number of them have been disrupted to
become pseudogenes. The acquisition of plasmids, insertion sequences and pseudogenes, along with large
genome rearrangements is indicative of a genome that has
decayed to adapt to the environment of a specific host.

Methods
Bacterial Strains
Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida A449 was originally isolated from a brown trout in the Eure river, France
by Christian Michel in 1975 [79]. Other Aeromonas strains
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC): A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida ATCC 33658T,
A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida ATCC 51413 (non-pigmented), A. salmonicida subsp. masoucida ATCC 27013T,

43979T, A. caviae ATCC 15468T and A. hydrophila ATCC
7966T.
Genome Sequencing
A mixed strategy was employed for sequencing the
genome of A449. A shotgun library was generated by cloning hydro-sheared and end-repaired 1–2 kb genomic
inserts into the plasmid vector pUC19. Clones from this
library were sequenced [80] from both direction on Li-Cor
4200 and MegaBace 1000 instruments. As well, a BAC
library was constructed by partial digestion of genomic
DNA with EcoRI and cloning in pBACe3.6 [81]. Twelve
clones from this library were sequenced completely. All
reads were assembled in gap4 [82] to produce ~2100 contigs with approximately 6× coverage. Contigs were joined
using a read-pair approach as well as a two-step PCRbased approach involving two primers at the contig ends
and a random primer. For contig closure, a fosmid library
was made in the EpiFOS vector (Epicentre Biotechnologies) and clones were end-sequenced to locate their position in the assembly. Sequence from these clones was
used for confirming assembly as well as to fill the remaining gaps. Finally, the sequence was completely disambiguated and polished by sequencing genomic PCR
products generated with flanking primer pairs. Presumptive plasmid contigs were identified by similarity to common plasmid encoded genes, removed from the main
assembly and joined by PCR experiments using primers at
the contig ends. pAsa4 was cloned into E. coli DH5α by
transformation with a plasmid DNA preparation from
A449 and selection on chloramphenicol. This clone was
used to identify pAsa4 contigs and to join and polish the
sequence. The A449 chromosome and plasmid 4 and 5
sequences have been deposited in Genbank (NC_009348,
NC_009439, NC_009350).
Annotation
Initial analysis of the genome sequences was done using a
script written in Perl and relying heavily on the BioPerl
modules [83]. The script initially searched for rRNA and
transposon sequences using Blastn [84] followed by a
tRNA search using tRNAscan-SE [85]. sRNA sequences
were also identified with rfam_scan.pl which uses Blast
and INFERNAL [86] searches of the Rfam database [87].
Open reading frames were identified with Glimmer2 [88]
and searched for similarity using Blastp and for conserved
domains with CDD [89]. Sequences between open reading frames with Blastp or CDD hits were extracted and further searched with Blastx and Blastn. All search results
were assembled in an EMBL feature table file for editing in
Artemis [90]. Final annotation was done by hand in
Artemis. Chromosome and large plasmid representations

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/427

were produced using the Genome Atlas website [91].
Comparisons between the A. salmonicida and A. hydrophila
chromosomes used the Mummer package [68].
Frameshift Analysis
To investigate the presence of frameshifts in other Aeromonas species and subspecies, primers flanking frameshift
sites (Additional file 2) were designed with Primer 3 [92].
Aeromonas species and subspecies were grown in tryptic
soy broth and DNA was extracted for use as the template
in standard PCR reactions. PCR products were gel purified
and sequenced directly. Unsuccessful amplifications were
attempted at least two more times using a lower annealing
temperature. RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were as
described previously [35]. Sequences were deposited in
Genbank under accession numbers FJ178190–FJ178298.
