Corynebacterium mucifaciens in an
immunocompetent patient with cavitary
pneumonia

Abstract
Background: Corynebacterium mucifaciens has been mainly isolated from skin, blood and from other normallysterile body fluids. It has rarely been described as a human pathogen since its description.
Case presentation: We herein report the first case of cavitary pneumonia due to C. mucifaciens in an
immunocompetent man returning from Maghreb.
Conclusion: C. mucifaciens should be considered as important human pathogen in patients with severe illness and
compatible history of exposure even in individuals with no clearly identified immunosuppression.

Background
Pathogenic manifestations of infection by Corynebacterium species have been mainly described to occur during
C. diphtheriae infection, both among children or adult
individuals [1]. Indeed, other strains belonging to the
Corynebacterium group remain rarely recognized as
human pathogens, mainly in immunocompromised
patients [1-3]. To the best of our knowledge, we herein
report the first case of a cavitary pneumonia associated
with C. mucifaciens isolation from blood cultures made
from an adult immunocompetent male patient.
Case presentation
A 50-year-old man was referred to our clinic with a 10day history of high-grade fever accompanied with severe
dyspnea, dry cough and thoracic pain. He is Moroccan
in origin and was living in France (Paris and then Bordeaux) for 20 years with a yearly 2- to 4-week stay in
his country of origin. Indeed, he was visiting his family
in Morocco for two weeks in a farm with regular exposure to horses and horse sheds when he became ill. At
admission, the patient had general status impairment
with a 12-kg emaciation, body temperature at 39.5°C

and crepitant wheezes in the left hemi-thorax. Blood
investigations showed a WBC count of 21 700/μL (neutrophils, 81%), an ESR of 111 mm/h (normal, <15), a
glucose of 7.4 mmol/L (normal, 3.6-5.8), a fibrinogen of
10 g/L (normal, 2-4), a procalcitonin of 24 ng/mL (normal, <0.5) and a C-reactive protein of 280 mg/L (normal, <5). A chest roentgenogram and a thoracic
computerized axial tomography revealed a left-upperlobe excavated infiltrate with pleural effusion (Figure 1).
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was
ruled out by serological testing and the patient was not
immunocompromised (CD4+T cell count, 1355/μL).
There was no recent or past history of alcohol intake.
The only significative co-morbidity was a well-controlled
type II diabetes mellitus. Other causes of defective
immunity were also seeked, such as common immune
variable deficiency, liver disease or malignancy.
Blood cultures were drawn twice and became positive
after three days of incubation in an aerobic medium
(Bactec plus aerobic/F-Becton Dickinson (BD) France)
revealing diphteroïd, occasionally coccoïd non-motile
gram-positive bacilli. The organism was sub-cultured on
Columbia agar supplemented with 5% plain sheep blood
(BD France) in aerobic and nutritive agar atmosphere at
37°C. Colonies produced in 24 h incubation were circular, mucoïd, slightly yellowish and about 2 mm (Figure 2). Firstly, physiologic tests realized in the API
corynesystem (bioMérieux-F) strips were catalase

positive, showed a positive reaction for pyrazinamidase,
pyrolidonyl arylamidase, alkaline phosphatase, and acid
production from glucose and maltose, were negative for
oxydase, nitrate reduction, and urease. By this time, the
attempt to identify the organism gave the numerical
code 6100125 which corresponded, according to the system’s database with the identification of Corynebacterium striatum/amycolatum with 88.7% similarity.
Subsequently, a second API corynesystem was realized

by the National Reference Centre for Corynebacterium
diphtheriae, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France and gave the
numerical code 6100104. The phenotypic identification
was not changed but the acid production from maltose
was negative like for the type strain of C. mucifaciens
(GeneBank accession no. Y11200). Concurrently, the
alternative diagnosis of Rhodococcus equi was not definitely ruled out considering both the mucoid colony
morphology, the clinical presentation as cavitary pneumonia, and the recent direct exposure to premises used
to house horses as consistent environmental reservoir of
the latter organism.
On this behalf, the numerical code 001199 was given
to the isolate and complete sequence analysis of the 16
S rRNA gene from the isolate was carried out as
described previously [4,5]. A total of 1,208 continuous
nucleotides were determined. Sequence of isolate
001199 (GenBank accession no. HQ337895) was compared to all bacterial sequences available from the GenBank database by using the BLAST program http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi and the MegAlign
module of the Lasergene software (DNASTAR). A phylogenetic tree was generated by using the neighbourjoining algorithm [6] (Figure 3). Our isolate was found
to 0.8% of divergence with the type strains of C. mucifaciens. Thus, isolate 001199 was definitely identified to
belong to the species Corynebacterium mucifaciens.
Besides, the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern
showed the strain was susceptible for b-lactams, aminoglycosides and glycopeptides. Treatment was initiated
with rifampicin-spiramycin combination and was not
changed even when the coryneform bacterium identification was later moved to C. mucifaciens. The patient
rapidly improved in the general condition with clinical
cure after four weeks but the treatment was continued
for three additional weeks. Consistently, chest radiography after four weeks showed a minimal residual homolateral pleuritis involvement. At the end of the
treatment, thoracic computerized tomography showed
complete radiological recovery. The patient was followed
during five years after the episode without relapse.

Conclusions
Many new species of coryneform bacteria have been
recently discovered and old species renamed, especially
after molecular biology techniques were introduced. For
many years, these organisms were disregarded as skin
contaminants [7]. However, they have been recognized
as important human pathogens, often acting as opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised or severely-ill
patients with symptoms compatible with bacteremia and
without presence of other pathogenic organism [1-3,8].
Thus, eight strains of one of these new species had previously been isolated from human relevant clinical

material. Concurrently, electron microscopy and comparative 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that
those formerly unknown coryneform bacteria belonged
to a new subline within the genus corynebacterium and
the name C. mucifaciens sp. was proposed [9]. Concerning the origin of the eight strains studied, they were

isolated between 1992 and 1996. Of these, seven were
from Switzerland and one from Germany. The clinical
sources were six from blood, one from joint fluid and
another one from wound swab. Clinical patterns associated with isolation were respectively intestinal bleeding, cardiac surgery, HIV infection, arthritis or cat bite,

and for the three remaining, fever of unknown origin.
No information was noticed concerning therapeutic
regimen, outcome or risk factors for exposure to C.
mucifaciens [9]. Concerning reports from human clinical
specimens in non-European geographic areas, the evaluation of rare Corynebacterium species recovered in
Canada have identified 23 strains of C. mucifaciens
between 1985 and 2001. Of note, many of the clinical
sources had been reported previously [9], with 10 from
blood, three from abscesses or wound, although with
the exception of recovery from dialysis and peritoneal
fluid [3]. Detailed clinical information for underlying
diseases of the patients was generally not available.
More recently in the 2003-2005 period, five strains were
identified in Japan from specimens of middle ear effusion cultures conducted in patients with otitis media
with effusion, and four other strains were isolated from
the nasal polyps and nasal discharge of patients with
chronic sinusitis [10].
Although coryneform bacteria are commonly part of
the normal flora of skin, their potential pathogenicity
still remains to be assessed [1,2,7]. Indeed, these organisms have been increasingly implicated in serious infections and a fatal case of bacteremia due to an atypical
strain of C. mucifaciens has been recently reported in an
elderly Brazilian severely-ill woman [8]. Thereby, potential critical issue is stressing the importance for rapid
and accurate laboratory identification and susceptibility
testing of such unusual pathogens that might improve
treatment and outcome of associated infection. In the
case reported herein, the investigation was supported by
a reference laboratory to confirm identification and provide molecular typing analysis of patient isolate.
With few exceptions, all Corynebacterium show good
response to penicillin or vancomycin. In case of C.
mucifaciens, beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides
appear to have good activity [9].
From the sparse case series of patients infected with
C. mucifaciens, no clear environmental exposure patterns have been recorded or evidenced. On the contrary, our patient had a recent history of contact with
horses and horse sheds. Of interest, a study aiming to
characterize the microbial exposure on farms using
environmental dust has been previously conducted.
This survey concluded that farms were highly exposed
to different bacteria species including C. mucifaciens.
Moreover, methods using single-strand conformation
polymorphism were modified and validated for characterizing bacterial communities in environmental dusts.
Results confirmed the transfer of microorganisms from
animal-sheds (cow, chicken, and horse) to human
environment [11].
In summary, the strain isolated in our case showed the
most morphological and biochemical characters for C.

horse contact and equine premises exposure, although
the source of contamination and the transmission could
not be formerly established.
