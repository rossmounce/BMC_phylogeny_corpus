Abstract
Sex determination is the process deciding the sex of a developing embryo. This is usually
determined genetically; however it is a delicate process, which in many cases can be influenced by
environmental factors. The mechanisms controlling zebrafish sex determination and differentiation
are not known. To date no sex linked genes have been identified in zebrafish and no sex
chromosomes have been identified. However, a number of genes, as presented here, have been
linked to the process of sex determination or differentiation in zebrafish. The zebrafish FTZ-F1
genes are of central interest as they are involved in regulating interrenal development and thereby
steroid biosynthesis, as well as that they show expression patterns congruent with reproductive
tissue differentiation and function. Zebrafish can be sex reversed by exposure to estrogens,
suggesting that the estrogen levels are crucial during sex differentiation. The Cyp19 gene product
aromatase converts testosterone into 17 beta-estradiol, and when inhibited leads to male to female
sex reversal. FTZ-F1 genes are strongly linked to steroid biosynthesis and the regulatory region of
Cyp19 contains binding sites for FTZ-F1 genes, further linking FTZ-F1 to this process. The role of
FTZ-F1 and other candidates for zebrafish sex determination and differentiation is in focus of this
review.

Sex determination
Among mammals sex is usually defined by the presence or
absence of the sex specific chromosome Y. In many, but
not all, fish species there is also a chromosomal background to sex determination. Several fishes, including
most salmonids, have heterogametic males and homogametic females, similar to the mammalian XY/XX-system
[1-3]. Other species, such as Poecilia, have homogametic
males and heterogametic females (ZZ/ZW), which also is
the case for birds [4]. Some species of the Poecilid platyfish Xiphophorus, utilize a system with three sex chromosomes [5]. In yet other species sex determination is
influenced by environmental factors such as the tempera-

ture surrounding the developing embryo [6-8]. Hermaphroditism is also a common feature of several fish species.
Several studies have shown that species with genetic sex
determination can be directed to produce genetically sexreversed offspring. This is accomplished either by treating
the fish with hormones, which can induce sex reversal in
synchronous hermaphroditic fish [9,10] and masculinization/feminization in gonochoristic species, or by incubating embryos in certain temperatures or pH [11]. The
proportion of males usually increases with temperature
whereas lower temperatures favour females. In the case of
pH, species differences have been observed.

There are few studies of sex determination in fish and the
genetic mechanisms behind sex determination in fish
remain largely unknown. Environmental factors, including endocrine disrupters such as diethylstilbestrol, PCBs
or dioxins, can affect both teleost and mammalian reproductive systems, but do not seem to alter sex ratios or
cause sex reversals in mammals. This indicates that mammalian sex determination is more strictly genetic, and
shows less gonad plasticity than teleosts. However, it has
been observed that a number of genes, both sex-linked
and autosomal, display dosage effects in mammals (Table
1), suggesting that allelic variants could account for differences in gene function.
While the developmental mechanisms by which the
mammalian gonads are formed have been thoroughly
studied and several genes involved have been identified,
only a few of these genes have been identified in fish. The
functions of these genes have not been fully elucidated in
fish and both conserved and divergent functions between
mammals and fish have been suggested. As zebrafish is an
important vertebrate model for developmental biology it
is vital that the basic developmental mechanisms of sex
determination are further studied in this species. In the
present review we discuss the roles of genes involved in
sex determination with a focus on the potential role of
FTZ-F1 genes in zebrafish sex determination and differentiation. From the present knowledge of these genes in
zebrafish we attempt to present a model for zebrafish sex
determination and differentiation.

Formation and differentiation of gonads
There is a close anatomical relationship between the
development of the genital ridge and the excretory system
during early ontogeny of all vertebrates, including fish. A
mesodermal layer ventral to the somites differentiates

[16]
[17]
[18]
[19]

into structures involved in excretion and reproduction.
There are species differences in how closely connected
these structures are in regard to sharing ducts for secretion
[20]. The teleost gonads are similar to those in mammals.
The testis contains Sertoli and Leydig cells in addition to
germ cells, and the ovary consists of thecal cells and granulosa cells surrounding the ovum. In both teleosts and
mammals the interstitial cells (Leydig and theca), Sertoli
cells and granulosa cells are of the same origin. An important difference is that the mammalian gonads are terminally developed into either testis or ovary, while fish
gonads often retain the ability to change, making them
sequential hermaphrodites [21]. Immature teleost gonads
can be directed to develop into testes or ovaries, regardless
of chromosomal background, by hormone treatment
[22,11]. Far too few fish species have been studied with
regard to gonad development to be able to develop a general model of how this occurs.
The zebrafish has become a useful vertebrate model system and is probably the most studied fish in developmental biology. The zebrafish diploid genome consists of 50
chromosomes and no specific sex chromosomes have
been identified. The use of synaptonemal complex studies
rather indicates that no sex chromosomes exist in
zebrafish [23,24]. Teleosts have a partially duplicated
genome, which in zebrafish has been determined by studying HOX-clusters [25], and this further complicates the
elucidation of potential sex linked genes. In theory, there
may be smaller genomic differences that account for or
direct the development toward two separate sexes. By
studying patterns of inheritance, zebrafish have been suggested to have XY-like chromosomal background [26].
However, the opposite system, with heterogametic
females in zebrafish has also been suggested [27]. The
inconsistency of results regarding sex chromosomes in

zebrafish suggests that the sex determining system is labile
and that no clear sex determining chromosome exist. The
zebrafish is sexually mature after approximately three
months, but separate sexes can be detected after 21–23
days post fertilization (dpf) [26]. Prior to sex differentiation all zebrafish develop ovary-like gonads, regardless of
chromosomal background. Ovarian development is the
default pathway, which is initiated after 10 dpf and
progress until 20 dpf. At 21 dpf until approximately 30
dpf testis development is initiated in males simultaneously with ovarian apoptosis.
The gonad development in zebrafish begins during
embryogenesis. Using Vasa as a marker gene, germ cells
can be detected in the area ventral to the third to fifth
somite at the six-somite stage [28]. While germ cells can
be detected earlier, they are not properly positioned until
around the 6 somite stage. So far no studies have been
made regarding markers for gonadal steroidogenic precursor cells, rendering it difficult to know exactly where these
cells are located in the embryo. But, it is likely that these
cells derive from an area close to where Vasa is detected at
the six-somite stage. The zebrafish Wilms Tumour-1
(WT1) is also initially detected in an area corresponding
to that of Vasa but is later expressed in the pronephric
ducts [29], making this region probable for the development of the rest of the zebrafish gonadal cells.

Candidate genes in zebrafish sex determination
In zebrafish, little information exists regarding sex determination and the potential presence of sex chromosomes.
To date, no sex-linked genes have been identified. However, a number of genes, as presented here, have been
linked to the process of sex determination or differentiation in zebrafish. Since none of the genes have been
shown to be sex-linked, it is not likely that any of the
below listed genes is the single factor responsible for specifying sex in zebrafish. Still, the expression patterns and
regulatory mechanisms of these genes leads to the conclusion that they are part of a signalling network responsible
for the development of sex specific gonads. In line with
observations on mammals (Table 1) gene dosage effects
may be a factor involved in zebrafish sex determination.
Since no sex-linked genes have been found in zebrafish,
allelic variants and dosage effects of autosomal genes,
such as the Fushi Tarazu factor-1 (FTZ-F1) genes, SRY
HMG box related gene 9 (Sox9), WT-1, Anti-Mullerian
Hormone (AMH), doublesex-mab 3 related gene (Dmrt1)
and GATA4 (a zinc finger transcription factor) may be
involved in determining sex and directing gonad development. The dosage dependent region on X (Dax-1) is
highly involved in female sex determination in mammals,
but no dax-1 gene homologue has so far been identified
in zebrafish. The Dax-1 gene has however been identified

http://www.rbej.com/content/3/1/63

in the Nile Tilapia [30], suggesting that other fish species
may also have Dax-1 homologues.

SOX9
Even when sex determination in teleost fish has a genetic
background, they lack an equivalent to the testis-determining factor SRY found in mammals. However, several
HMG-box containing genes, Sox-genes, have been identified in fish [31-33]. In zebrafish, two Sox9 genes, termed
Sox9a and Sox9b, have been identified. Both contain the
HMG-box and are able to bind the AACAAAG recognition
site in a similar manner as murine Sox9 [34]. The expression patterns of Sox9a and b are dissimilar in adult
zebrafish. Sox9a displays a broad expression pattern and
has been found in brain, kidney, muscle, testis and pectoral fin, whereas Sox9b is only found in ovary. During
embryogenesis Sox9a and b are both expressed in cells
involved in craniofacial development and in the brain
[34]. In addition Sox9a has been shown to be essential for
chondrogenic development [35] and Sox9b has been
implicated to be involved in neural crest development
[36]. Whether Sox9a and/or b are involved in sex determination or differentiation has so far not been studied.
However, an HMG-Box cis element has been identified in
gene promoter of fushi tarazu factor 1a (ff1a) [37]. Sox9a
is also able to specifically bind this site in vitro (von Hofsten et al., unpublished) indicating that a regulatory connection between Sox9a and ff1a is present in zebrafish.
Zebrafish embryos homozygous for jellyfish (jef) (mutations in sox9a) show craniofacial defects and lack of cartilage similar to humans with campomelic dysplasia [35].
The jef strain is still able to reproduce, which leads to the
conclusion that Sox9a alone does not direct sex determination and differentiation in zebrafish.

AMH
AMH may not be excluded as a factor involved in the sex
determining process in zebrafish. Although fish lack
Müllerian ducts, other AMH functions may be important
for gonad development. In mammals AMH is, in addition
to Müllerian degeneration, involved in regulation of
gonadal steroidogenesis. AMH inhibits the expression of
aromatase in developing gonads [38]. It also negatively
modulates the differentiation and function of Leydig cells
[39] by down regulating several enzymes involved in the
steroidogenic pathway. Ovarian cell growth is inhibited
by AMH in vitro [40]. An AMH related gene, eel spermatogenesis related substances 21 (eSRS21) identified in the
Japanese eel is mainly expressed in Sertoli cells and down
regulates 11 KT induced spermatogenesis. This indicates
that eSRS21 and genes related to AMH have important
reproductive functions and are involved in sex determination and differentiation in fish [41]. In zebrafish, we
recently cloned an AMH cDNA and observed that it was
expressed exclusively in gonads [42]. AMH expression

Figure structure of zebrafish FTZ-F1 proteins
General 1
General structure of zebrafish FTZ-F1 proteins. The zebrafish FTZ-F1 proteins consist of four main regions, the modulator domain, DNA-binding domain (DBD), hinge region and the ligand-binding domain. The DBD contains a Zink-finger region,
an A- and P-box for recognition of the FTZ-F1 response element, and a T-box for stabilising the DNA-binding. The proximal
repressive- and interactive domains (PRD and PID) are used for interactions with co-repressors and co-activators. The ligand
binding-domain containing the I-box and AF-2 region, which both are involved in ligand binding and transactivation, and a distal
repressive domain (DRD) for co-repressor binding.

was, by in situ hybridization, found predominantly in Sertoli cells in testis and in the follicular layer in ovaries.
Interestingly, AMH is co-expressed both with the Steroidogenic Factor-1 (SF-1) homologue ff1d and Sox9a
within these cells [42,43]. AMH displays complex regulation in mammals, involving several factors, including the
FTZ-F1 related gene SF-1, GATA4, Sox9 and WT1 [44,45].
The transcriptional regulation of zebrafish AMH has so far
not been elucidated. However, the AMH gene promoter
sequence contains putative binding sites for the same
transcription factors that regulate mammalian AMH, indicating a conserved regulatory mechanism in vertebrates.

WT1
As in mammals, the anlagen for the excretion and reproductive systems both derive from intermediate mesoderm
[46-48]. WT1 was originally found to be a suppressor of
Wilms tumour, as individuals with inactivated WT1 developed the Wilms tumour condition [49]. WT1 is also a crucial factor in the differentiation of renal tissue. In
zebrafish, WT1 has been shown to be expressed in the
intermediate mesoderm prior to and during renal tissue
differentiation [29]. It is also essential for the steroidogenic interrenal development together with ff1b [50]. WT1
is thereby an important factor in the early events during
development of gonadal primordium.

FTZ-F1 (NR5A)
The Drosophila homeobox gene fushi tarazu (ftz) was initially identified as a central factor for segmentation, as
inhibition of ftz resulted in the development of fewer segments [51,52]. The fushi tarazu factor-1 (FTZ-F1) was later
identified as the key regulator of ftz expression [53,54].
Genes homologous to the Drosophila FTZ-F1 have subsequently been identified in several species in different
phyla [55-63]. Several different names have been given to
these homologues, including steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1), adrenal-4-binding protein (Ad4BP), embryonal long
terminal repeat-binding protein (ELP), α-fetoprotein
transcription factor (FTF) and liver receptor homologue-1
(LRH-1). However, lately a nomenclature system presented by the nuclear receptor committee groups the FTZF1 homologues under the name NR5A [64].
The mammalian genome contains two FTZ-F1 homologues (NR5A1 and NR5A2). NR5A1 contains the SF-1
related genes, which are closely connected to steroidogenesis. In mammals, the NR5A1 genes are expressed in steroidogenic tissues, are key regulators of steroidogenesis
and are involved in the testis determining pathway during
sex determination [65-67]. The NR5A2 genes are linked to
regulation of the estrogen-binding α-fetoprotein [60]. The
mammalian NR5A2 genes are expressed in steroidogenic

tissues as well as liver, pancreas and intestine, but appear
to be more involved in cholesterol metabolism than steroid synthesis or sex determination.

Zebrafish FTZ-F1
FTZ-F1 homologues have been identified in a number of
teleost species [55-57,68-70]. Several teleosts have multiple variants of FTZ-F1 genes. The roles and functions of
these genes are not completely elucidated, but all studies
conducted so far indicate an involvement in the reproductive axis or in steroidogenesis. The ff1 proteins share the
general structure of other nuclear receptors. They contain
a DNA binding domain (DBD) with two Zn-fingers and
the FTZ-F1 box for DNA interaction and recognition, a
hinge domain that connects to the ligand-binding
domain (LBD), which contains the I-box for protein-protein interaction and the activator function-2 (AF-2)
domain for transcriptional activation (Fig. 1). Zebrafish is
the most extensively studied teleost and four FTZ-F1 genes
have been identified (ff1a, b, c and d). The arrangement of
FTZ-F1 genes into the nuclear receptor 5A subgroups is a
suitable system for genes in higher vertebrates, as no
indistinguishable genes have been described so far in

these animals. However, teleosts and particularly
zebrafish are different in more than one way compared to
higher vertebrates. Zebrafish have four different FTZ-F1
genes, whereas mammals and higher vertebrates only possess two. The zebrafish genes are not easily arranged
within the NR5A subgroups. Zebrafish ff1a and Arctic char
ff1 aligns well within the NR5A2 subgroup (Fig. 2), but
their expression patterns and suggested functions do not
fit the description of the mammalian NR5A2 genes. The
zebrafish ff1c does not align well with any of the
described subgroups, which further raises the question of
how appropriate the subdivisions really are for teleost
FTZ-F1. Ff1d and ff1b are similar and aligns together with
medaka FTZ-F1 in a subgroup within the NR5A1 clade.
This subgroup has previously been named NR5A4, but
recent data indicates that the genes in the NR5A4 subgroup are NR5A1 homologous. Recently it was suggested
that ff1b and ff1d are of the same origin and arose from
ancestral gene duplication [71]. This was supported by the
overlapping expression patterns found in embryonic
interrenal and pituitary cells [42]. The tissue distribution
of ff1b and ff1d is identical, while it differs from ff1a and
ff1c (Fig. 3). The combined information of ff1b and ff1d
expression patterns, function and sequence similarities to
other genes in the NR5A1 group suggest that these genes
should be considered as homologues.

Ff1a
The first FTZ-F1 gene described in zebrafish was ff1a [55].
The gene was named zff1, as no other zebrafish ff1 genes
were known at that time. With the identification of additional ff1 genes it was later renamed ff1a. The gene possesses two splicing variants, now designated ff1a-A and
ff1a-B. Ff1a-A was, in synergy with ER, shown to transcriptionally activate a gonadotropin promoter, whereas ff1a-B
acted as an inhibitor of ff1a-A due to its lack of the AF-2
trans-activation domain. The expression of zebrafish ff1a
was later shown to be driven by two separate gene promoters, giving rise to a total of four separate gene transcripts, ff1a-IA, ff1a-IB, ff1a-IIA and ff1aIIB [72].

The functional difference between ff1a proteins consisting
of exon one, transcribed via promoter I, and proteins transcribed from promoter II has so far not been studied.
However, they differ slightly in their tissue distribution,
where promoter I derived transcripts are lacking in brain
and heart [72]. The two ff1a promoters contain different
putative response elements [37,72]. This suggests that the
two promoters regulate ff1a in tissue specific manners and
during different developmental stages rather than rendering them separate functions. Also mouse and rat have two
separately regulated NR5A promoters [65,73].
Two of the putative response elements in promoter I indicate an involvement in somitogenesis. MyoD and Snail
are both transcription factors shown to be involved in
somite development [74,75], indicating that promoter I
may drive the ff1a expression during somitogenesis. The
ff1a IIA gene product is involved in muscle differentiation
during somitogenesis. Microinjection of ff1a AII mRNA
into the ubo-mutant strain, which lack slow-twitch muscle
cells, results in partially restored myofibers [76]. Promoter
II contains an HMG-Box response element 24–31 bp up
stream of the transcription start. An identical response element has been shown to bind Sox9a in vitro [34] and Sox9
is hence a putative regulator of gonadal expression of ff1a.
Expression of ff1a can be detected in the uro-genital and
pronephric duct region during early somitogenesis [77]
and by linking the ff1a dual promoter to GFP, early
gonadal expression can be detected 5 dpf after microinjection [37]. This indicates a role in early gonad development and differentiation. The Arctic char ff1 homologue
has been linked to steroidogenesis by showing a cyclic
expression pattern during the reproductive maturation
process and 17β-estradiol mediated down-regulation of
testicular expression [56]. The phylogenetic relationship
indicates that the Arctic char ff1 belongs to the ff1a related
genes and should be named ff1a (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the
developmental expression pattern of Arctic char ff1a is
similar to zebrafish ff1a [78], indicating that teleost ff1a
homologues are involved both in steroidogenesis and
gonad development.

http://www.rbej.com/content/3/1/63

Ff1b
The ff1b gene was initially assigned to functions related to
pancreatic development as it was co-expressed with pancreas duodenum homeobox-1 (pdx-1) and proinsulin
[56]. However, more recent publications suggest that ff1b
is an important factor for steroidogenic cell development
and that ff1b is required for the differentiation of the
interrenal organ [79,80]. The expression of ff1b precedes
that of cyp11A and 3βHSD in the embryonic interrenal
cells and ff1b morpholino knock down experiments abolishes the expression of these two genes [79].

The down stream transcriptional activation function of
ff1b is modulated by protein-protein interactions with
homeodomain protein Prox1 [80]. Two domains are
needed for the interaction, the I-box and the AF-2
domain, both situated in the LBD. Binding to Prox1 leads
to a repression of down stream trans-activation. There is
also a co-localization of ff1b and Prox1 expression in the
developing interrenal. Due to the conserved I-boxes and
AF-2 domains, both ff1a and ff1c are probably able to
interact with Prox1, although less efficiently than ff1b.
Ff1c
There is little information available regarding ff1c functions, regulation or expression patterns. Except for a weak
interaction between Prox1 and ff1c presented in Liu et al.
[80], the sequence published on GenBank, (AF327373) is
the only published data available so far. Expression of ff1c
can be detected in numerous tissues in adult zebrafish and
its highest expression is found in liver and intestine, indicating a role in cholesterol metabolism, similar to ff1a
(see Fig. 3). No specific ff1c expression domains have
been identified during embryogenesis. Both ff1c and ff1d
are similar to ff1a and b in their DNA-binding domains
where the FTZ-F1 box is situated and in the ligand binding
domains, but are less conserved in their hinge regions. All
zebrafish ff1 have highly conserved AF-2 domains and IBoxes in their LBD.
Ff1d
Ff1b and ff1d display an overlapping expression pattern
during embryogenesis. They share protein domains
important for co-factor interactions and have been suggested to be the result of an ancestral gene duplication
[42,71]. Even though the two zebrafish NR5A1 genes are
similar in several aspects, the shared sequence identities
are 62%, which suggests that functional differences are
likely to exist. Expression of ff1d in adult zebrafish is
restricted to brain, gonads and liver [42]. There also seem
to be sexual differences, as ff1d expression is higher in testis than in ovary. In the testis ff1d is highly expressed in
interstitial Leydig cells and Sertoli cells, but cannot be
detected in germ cells. In ovary ff1d is located to the follicular layer and inside the oocyte [42]. Although the func-

tion and regulatory mechanisms of ff1d in these cells
needs to be further studied, a possible target of ff1d is
AMH, which is co-expressed with ff1d in Sertoli cells and
in the follicular layer. During mammalian sex determination and differentiation, the ff1d homolog SF-1 regulates
the expression of AMH, leading to the development of
male sex characteristics. Therefore it is intriguing that this
may be a conserved vertebrate developmental mechanism.

sequences. GATA-4 plays an important role as transcriptional regulator of SRY and AMH during mammalian sex
determination and differentiation [95]. Studies of
zebrafish GATA factors have so far been associated with
the development of organ systems other than the urogenital, but binding sites for GATA4 have been found in the
cyp19 gene promoter [96,97] suggesting a role in regulating aromatase expression.

Aromatase
Dmrt1
The lack of testis-determining factor similar to SRY in fish
is not a unique phenomenon. This is also the case for
many other lower vertebrates. Genes containing a DMdomain (Dmrt1) have however been identified in fish.
DM-domain containing genes are involved in sex determination in both vertebrates and invertebrates [81], which is
a unique conservation of function between phyla, not
seen in any other gene involved in sex determination. Different Dmrt1 homologues have been shown to be
involved in gonad development [82,83] and somitogenesis [84].
The teleost Japanese medaka has specific sex chromosomes (XX/XY), where the DM-domain gene DMY has
been mapped to the Y-chromosome and has been shown
to be essential for testis differentiation [85,86]. This was
determined by isolating the sex-determining region on the
male specific Y-chromosome. Except for the DMY-containing region, the X and Y-chromosomes are very similar.
This indicates that the medaka Y-chromosome and DMY
are, in an evolutionary prospective, relatively new. This
theory was later confirmed and DMY was discarded as a
universal teleost sex-determining gene, as it was shown to
be a species-specific sex-determining strategy [87]. No target genes for DMY have been identified and DMY function
in testis development remains unresolved. Treating birds
with the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole lead to elevated
Dmrt1 levels indicating that Dmrt1 may be down regulated by aromatase [88]. This indicates that Dmrt1 may
have an important role in testis determination in teleosts,
since alteration of aromatase levels during sex differentiation can cause sex reversals. The regulation of Dmrt1
related genes in teleosts remains unknown, but testicular
expression of Dmrt1 is in mammals regulated by GATA4
[89].

GATA
GATA factors are divided into two families based on
expression patterns, structure, and function [90]. GATA-1/
2/3 is most commonly associated with haematopoietic
cell and neuronal development [91,92]. GATA-4/5/6 are
usually linked to organ development, including the urogenital system [93,94]. GATA factors recognize and bind
the DNA consensus motif, WGATAR, and closely related

Steroidogenesis, sex determination and differentiation are
closely related to each other. SF-1 is one of the crucial factors essential for steroid biosynthesis as well as sex determination and differentiation in mammals. The terminal
sex-hormone products in the steroid biosynthesis pathway are androgens and estrogens, and the balance
between them leads to the development of proper sex
characteristics. Aromatase (Cyp 19) is the product of the
cyp19 gene, and is an important regulator of this balance.
Aromatase is produced in the gonads and directs the conversion of testosterone into 17β-estradiol.
Like many other fish species, the zebrafish genome contain two aromatase genes designated cyp19a and cyp19b
[98]. Cyp19a is highly expressed in the steroidogenic
Theca and granulosa cell layer surrounding the oocytes in
the ovary, whereas cyp19b is mainly expressed in brain.
Thus, while one aromatase gene appears to be involved in
gonadal development the other gene may be involved in
neuronal development. However, both genes contribute
to the regulation of estrogenic responses and may thus
influence sex differentiation. The regulation of teleost
cyp19 transcription is not completely elucidated, but the
zebrafish cyp19a promoter region contains binding sites
for Ftz-F1, which suggests a role for ff1 genes in the regulation of cyp19a expression in gonadal tissue [97,99]. FtzF1 dependent cyp19 transcription has also been documented in species from turtles to humans [100-102], indicating that this mechanism is conserved in all vertebrates.
In many vertebrates, reptiles in particular, the level or
activity of aromatase is the deciding factor for sex during
development [103,104]. The temperature surrounding
the developing embryos influences the activity of aromatase leading to variations in sex ratio [105]. A similar
scenario has been documented for several fish species,
including zebrafish, suggesting that aromatase is an
important factor in sex determination and differentiation
in fish. By using an aromatase inhibitor, or by increasing
water temperature to 35°C–37°C, oocyte apoptosis can
be induced in zebrafish [106]. However, during normal
breeding conditions the temperature is not an important
factor deciding sex ratios in zebrafish. The role of aromatase remains important in zebrafish sex determination
as exposure to the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole results in
sex-reversion of female zebrafish [106].

sex determination and differentiation. In XY/XX systems where SRY is the key regulator of sex determination its
absence leads to activation of Dax1 and female development.
The presence of SRY results in a hierarchy of activation of
genes leading to the development of testis. In this hierarchy
SF-1 (FTZ-F1) is a key regulator of steroidogenesis and AMH,
demonstrating its central role in sex determination and differentiation. ⊥: Inhibition, ↓: stimulation.

A generalized model of the involvement of different
genes in zebrafish sex determination and differentiation. While little is known of the hierarchy of genes involved
in zebrafish sex determination and differentiation several
genes have been identified. While aromatase has been shown
to play a central role in zebrafish sex differentiation the environmental and/or genetic mechanisms have not been fully
elucidated. ⊥: Inhibition, ↓: stimulation.

Sex determination and differentiation pathway
Studies of mammals have shown that genes involved in
sex determination have multiple functions but that the
presence of the SRY gene in animals with XY/XX chromosomal systems leads to male development. As discussed
earlier in this review many of the genes involved in mammalian sex determination show dosage dependent effects
on sex determination and differentiation. A generalised
genetic regulatory pathway can be extracted from the studies conducted on different vertebrate species (Fig. 4). Most
identified genes have a primary function in male development. The regulatory pathway includes, and is based on,
the presence of SRY and Dax-1, which in an antagonistic
manner direct the development of male and female phenotypes in mammals. Lack of the SRY gene, as is the case
in teleosts, suggest that when chromosomal sex determination exist it must be regulated by alternative genes. In
medaka the Dmrt1 gene was found to be the switch. However, this role for Dmrt1 is specific for medaka and it
remains that any of the other known genes in the sex
determination cascade could potentially develop into the
genetic switch in other teleost species. Or, there may be
yet unidentified genes and pathways that participate in
teleost sex determination.

Proposed model
From the information obtained to date it is not possible
to define a hierarchy of regulation during sex determination in teleosts. Therefore, the proposed model for
zebrafish sex determination is based on the same group of
male determining genes, excluding SRY and Dax-1, found
in mammals while the interplay between the genes
remains undefined (Fig. 5). Theoretically, any one of the
described genes may become the sex determining gene, as
several of them have been shown to cause sex reversals in
mammalian model systems in a dosage dependent way
(see table 1). The male determining switch may also be
dependent on combinatory effects of allelic variants
among the genes involved. Furthermore, the regulation of
aromatase appears to be crucial for zebrafish sex determination.
The model suggests that ff1a and WT1 are important for
the differentiation of the uro-genital tissue, which subsequently develops into renal and gonadal tissue. WT1 is
essential for the differentiation of pronephros, and a battery of genes, including the FTZ-F1 genes, Sox9a, GATA4,
Dmrt1 and AMH, are involved in the differentiation of
gonads. During the critical time period around 25 dpf this
battery of genes may direct the development towards male
gonads in individuals with the allelic combinations pre-

destined to become male. This would lead to a decrease or
absence of aromatase and subsequent reduced estrogen
levels and activity, resulting in the onset of ovarian apoptosis, the differentiation of testicular Sertoli cells and
increased testosterone levels. The model is based on the
observation that adult female zebrafish can be sexreversed by inhibiting aromatase [106]. This suggests that
zebrafish has a high plasticity in their mechanism of gender development and that steroidogenesis plays an essential part in the sex determining process. The complex
mechanism of sex determination and differentiation is
still far from elucidated and the biochemistry behind it
must be further studied to establish protein interactions
controlling it. The FTZ-F1 genes are important, as they are
involved in the early development of uro-genital tissue
and as regulators of steroidogenic cells and their gene
expression.
