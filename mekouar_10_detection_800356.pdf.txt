Abstract
Background: Hemiascomycetous yeasts have intron-poor genomes with very few cases of alternative splicing. Most of
the reported examples result from intron retention in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and some have been shown to be
functionally significant. Here we used transcriptome-wide approaches to evaluate the mechanisms underlying the
generation of alternative transcripts in Yarrowia lipolytica, a yeast highly divergent from S. cerevisiae.
Results: Experimental investigation of Y. lipolytica gene models identified several cases of alternative splicing, mostly
generated by intron retention, principally affecting the first intron of the gene. The retention of introns almost
invariably creates a premature termination codon, as a direct consequence of the structure of intron boundaries. An
analysis of Y. lipolytica introns revealed that introns of multiples of three nucleotides in length, particularly those
without stop codons, were underrepresented. In other organisms, premature termination codon-containing
transcripts are targeted for degradation by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) machinery. In Y. lipolytica,
homologs of S. cerevisiae UPF1 and UPF2 genes were identified, but not UPF3. The inactivation of Y. lipolytica UPF1 and
UPF2 resulted in the accumulation of unspliced transcripts of a test set of genes.
Conclusions: Y. lipolytica is the hemiascomycete with the most intron-rich genome sequenced to date, and it has
several unusual genes with large introns or alternative transcription start sites, or introns in the 5' UTR. Our results
suggest Y. lipolytica intron structure is subject to significant constraints, leading to the under-representation of stop-free
introns. Consequently, intron-containing transcripts are degraded by a functional NMD pathway.
Background
From a genomic point of view Yarrowia lipolytica is
rather atypical among hemiascomycetous yeasts
sequenced to date [1]. Its genome is surprisingly large,
consisting of six chromosomes, a total of about 20.5 Mb
in size, more than one and a half times the size of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome and twice that of Kluyveromyces lactis. However, with an overall density of only one
gene per 3 kb and 6,449 predicted protein-coding genes,
the gene content of Y. lipolytica is similar to that of other
hemiascomycetes. The complete genome has a mean G +

C content of 49%, which is significantly higher than that
in other yeast genomes [1,2], with the exception of Eremothecium (Ashbyia) gossypii, which has a G + C content
of 52% [3]. The genome of Y. lipolytica is also unusual in
several other ways: atypical structure of chromosomal
origins of replication and centromeric DNA [4], large
number of tRNA genes [1,5], 5S rRNA genes dispersed
throughout the genome [1,6] and unique fusions between
tRNA genes and 5S rRNA genes [7]. Unlike most hemiascomycetes, in which ribosomal DNA loci are clustered
into a single locus on one chromosomal arm, Y. lipolytica
rDNA units, containing the 18S, 5.8S and 26S rRNA
genes, are found in six subtelomeric clusters [1,8], a distribution also observed in Pichia pastoris [9]. Y. lipolytica

is also unusual in having a highly diverse transposable
element content [10-13]. Y. lipolytica genes also display
an organization different from that of other hemiascomycetes, as some genes are interrupted by several spliceosomal introns, with up to five introns per gene [1,14].
The total number of introns, first estimated at 742 in the
2004 annotation, has now reached 1,119 with the data
presented in this study, and this number of introns is
larger than that in any other hemiascomycetous genome
sequenced to date (287 introns in S. cerevisiae [15]; 415
introns in Candida albicans [16]; 633 intron-containing
genes in P. pastoris [9]). Thus, about 15% of the genes
contain introns and the intron density is about 0.17.
Intron density varies considerably between eukaryotes
[17], from a few introns per genome in Giardia [18], to
more than eight per gene in humans [19]. Y. lipolytica is
thus considered to be an intron-poor species [20], but
alternative splicing (AS) was fortuitously observed for the
intron of the first gene of the Mutyl DNA transposon, for
which a combination of alternative 5'-splice sites (5'ss)
and 3'-splice sites (3'ss) is used [13]. AS generally results
from the combination of splice sites present in the premRNA, and may occur through four basic modes: use of
an alternative 5'ss, use of an alternative 3'ss, cassette-exon
skipping and intron retention. AS is currently thought to
occur in more than 60% of human genes [21-23], increasing the complexity of the transcriptome and leading to
genetic or malignant diseases in some cases [24,25]. By
contrast, very few examples of AS resulting in the production of multiple proteins have been reported in yeasts,
such as Schizosaccharomyces pombe [26] and S. cerevisiae
[27,28]. In a few additional cases, alternative transcripts
have been predicted in S. cerevisiae [29-31] and C. albicans [16] although without supporting evidence for multiple functional proteins. Many other cases of alternative
transcripts in yeasts, mostly identified by global transcriptomic approaches [32-34], involve intron retention
and result in nonsense-containing mRNAs. These cases
may result from inefficient splicing or missplicing [35]
due to suboptimal splicing signals [36]. These alternative
transcripts were thought to be largely non-functional.
However, in some cases, intron retention seems to be regulated by growth conditions, such as amino-acid starvation [37], or by a specific physiological state of the cells,
such as meiosis [15,38,39]. Other examples of regulated
splicing, in which the protein inhibits the splicing of its
own pre-mRNA, include RPL30 [40] and YRA1
[27,41,42].
Thus, the AS of mRNA generates two types of transcript: mRNAs to be translated into functional proteins
(thereby increasing the complexity/diversity of the proteome) or nonsense-containing mRNAs that may generate truncated proteins potentially deleterious to the cell if
translated. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a

Page 2 of 17

eukaryotic quality control mechanism that detects
mRNAs with a premature termination codon (PTC), targeting them for degradation and thus preventing their
translation (for review, see [43-45]). This RNA surveillance pathway is well documented in yeast, mammals,
fruit flies, nematodes and plants [46,47]. Different mechanisms of PTC recognition have been identified in different species, involving the exon-exon junction complex in
mammals, and the distance between the PTC and the
poly(A)-binding protein, also called the 'faux 3' UTR', in
yeast and fruit fly [48]. However, a unified model has also
been proposed in recent studies [49].
When introns are retained, a PTC may be generated by
the intron sequence itself or by the downstream exon
sequence if the intron does not consist of a multiple of
three nucleotides and thus generates a frameshift. This
observation led Jaillon et al. [50] to suggest that introns
are structured so as to favor their detection by the NMD
pathway in cases of intron retention. These authors
showed that, in different species from very different
phyla, intron size was subjected to strong constraints
leading to the counterselection of stop-less introns of size
3n (that is, consisting of a multiple of three nucleotides).
The mechanisms regulating AS and NMD are not fully
understood. Yeasts are tractable unicellular models that
could supply molecular information about such mechanisms. As Y. lipolytica has more introns than S. cerevisiae,
it is likely to display more AS and thus to be useful for
investigation of the associated molecular mechanisms.
We therefore investigated, in this organism, the population of transcripts from intron-containing genes, and
their likelihood of degradation by the NMD pathway,
through a combination of several different experimental
approaches.

Results
cDNA sequencing shows Y. lipolytica to have four times as
many introns as S. cerevisiae

We began our investigation of Y. lipolytica splicing by
using cDNA sequencing to revisit the in silico predictions
of intron-containing genes in this yeast. Three cDNA
libraries were constructed from mRNAs obtained from
cells grown under different conditions: exponential and
stationary phases on YPD medium ('expo', 9,409 reads;
and 'stat', 9,620 reads) and exponential phase on oleic
acid medium ('oleic', 9,405 reads).
We found that 1,659 of the 28,434 cDNA sequences
(5.8%) did not match the predicted coding sequence
(CDS), with 455 of these sequences not matching the Y.
lipolytica chromosome sequence but possibly corresponding to CDS in non-assembled contigs. Some of the
remaining 1,204 non-matching sequences displayed a significant match with 21 of the 137 predicted pseudogenes
in the sense (64 cDNA sequences) or anti-sense (22

cDNA sequences) orientation. The others corresponded
to intergenic regions with no predicted genetic elements.
Another set of 1,053 cDNA sequences (3.7%) matched,
in an anti-sense orientation, with 167 Y. lipolytica CDSs,
one of which (YALI0A21351g) was highly represented,
with 579 cDNA clones. YALI0A21351g has been predicted to encode a small gene product (89 amino acids)
with no homolog in databases, and may therefore be a
false open reading frame. The cDNA clones derived from
the antisense transcripts may thus correspond to a noncoding RNA, the structure and function of which remain
to be determined.
We found that 25,722 clones matched a CDS in the
expected orientation: 8,936, 8,614 and 8,172 clones in the
expo, stat and oleic libraries, respectively. About 59% of
the predicted genes (3,818 of 6,449) were expressed and
found in at least one library and about 70% of these
expressed genes (2,647 genes) were represented by at
least two different clones. Clone numbers per gene and
per library are given in Additional file 1. A few genes (13
genes) were represented by more than 100 clones, but
mostly by less than 200, in the different libraries. The
major
exceptions
were
YALI0D06237g
and
YALI0E15510g in the stat library, which had 713 clones
(8.7% of the stat clones) and 679 clones (8.3% of the stat
clones), respectively. YALI0D06237g encodes a putative
sphingolipid delta 4 desaturase and YALI0E15510g a
putative homeobox transcriptional repressor. Comparison between the cDNA sequences of the different libraries showed that only 20% of the sequenced cDNAs were
expressed in all three growth conditions (Figure S1 in
Additional file 2). About 12% of the sequenced cDNAs
were specific to the oleic or stat libraries, but almost
twice as many (22.6%) were specific to the expo library.
However, these figures are only approximations, as cDNA
library sequencing is certainly not the most sensitive way
to quantify gene expression. Some overlap in expression
patterns between the different conditions may therefore
have been missed due to low levels of expression or cloning biases.
Based on the cDNA data, the information in the
genome database concerning start codon coordinates, the
presence or absence of introns and intron coordinates,
when already predicted, was modified. New genes were
also detected, including three genes specifically induced
on oleic acid medium (SOA1, SOA2 and SOA3 genes
[51]). In total, 6,449 protein-coding genes are now predicted for Y. lipolytica strain E150 (Table 1). Gene model
modifications are reported in the Génolevures database
[52].
The number of predicted introns in the sequenced
E150 genome increased from 742 [1] to 1,083, and the
number of intron-containing genes increased to 951.
Most of these genes carry only one intron, but 109 multi-

Page 3 of 17

intronic genes with up to five introns were detected, most
(93 of 109) carrying two introns (Table 1). The internal
exons of the multi-intronic genes were mostly short, the
shortest being only four nucleotides long, in
YALI0E34170g, as validated by two cDNAs. Introns in 5'
UTRs were not systematically predicted during in silico
annotation by the Génolevures Consortium. Our data
revealed the presence of at least 36 introns in these 5'
non-coding regions of mRNAs, a number similar to that
reported for S. cerevisiae [31]. Thus, with 1,119 introns, Y.
lipolytica is the hemiascomycete with the largest number
of spliceosomal introns in its genome, with about four
times as many introns as S. cerevisiae.
Y. lipolytica introns have several unique features

Intron size in Y. lipolytica varies from 41 to 3,478 bp (16
introns were larger than 1 kb), with a mean length of 280
bp and a median length of 204 bp. This is a broader range
of sizes than observed in other yeasts, in which the maximum intron size is usually around 1 kb (1,002 bp for S.
cerevisiae). However, the intron size distribution is biased
toward short introns (33% of introns are less than 100 bp
long), with a dominant peak distribution between 41 and
60 nucleotides (Figure 1a). This bias has previously been
observed in other fungi, such as S. pombe and Neurospora
crassa [53]. As previously reported in other hemiascomycetes [54] and in some intron-poor eukaryotic genomes
[55,56], the position of introns in the coding sequence
was also biased. About 60% of all introns were inserted in
the first 10% of the CDS (Figure 1b) and this figure rose to
65% if only the first intron was considered. For example,
47 genes had a first coding exon of only one base, the adenine of the methionine initiation codon. We also detected
36 introns in the 5' UTRs of 33 genes, all but four of
which had no introns in their coding sequences. Most of
these 5' UTR introns were validated by cDNA sequencing
(Additional file 3). They were generally larger than the
introns in coding regions (Figure S2a in Additional file 2),
with only five 5' UTR introns less than 100 bp in length
(approximately 14% of the 5' UTR introns). We validated
this greater intron length by simulations: among 100 randomly generated sets of 36 introns chosen among the
1,083 introns, none presented a mean length equal or
superior to that of the 5' UTR introns (the maximum
mean length was 381 bp; Additional file 4). Size differences between the introns found in coding sequences and
those in 5' UTRs have already been reported for various
eukaryotes, including humans, mice, Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana [57].
Several unique features were identified when the intron
structure of Y. lipolytica was compared with that of other
hemiascomycetous yeasts. First, the branch point (BP)
and the 3'ss were found to form a combined sequence,
with a mean interval of one nucleotide between the

motifs (Figure S2a,b in Additional file 2). This finding was
previously reported for a small subset of introns of strain
W29 [14] and for a larger subset of introns of Y. lipolytica
sequenced strain [58,59]. This juxtaposition may result
from an evolutionary event that simplified the mechanism of spliceosomal assembly, combining the steps of BP
and 3'ss recognition [58], as hypothesized for two other
deep-branch eukaryotes, Trichomonas vaginalis and
Giardia lamblia [18]. Second, the consensus sequences at
intron boundaries were also found to be unusual for
yeasts. This was particularly true for the 5'ss, which had
the sequence GTGAGT, rather than the GTATGT
sequence found in most other hemiascomycetes
[14,58,60,61]. This 5'ss consensus, which is known to be
essential for intron recognition by base-pairing to U1
snRNAs, is indeed perfectly complementary to both Y.
lipolytica U1 RNAs (YALI0B14567r and YALI0B20936r;
Figure S3 in Additional file 2). Third, the internal BP is
less well conserved than in other hemiascomycetes
sequenced to date, with only five highly conserved residues (CTAAC in more than 92% of the introns) and an
upstream A less conserved (Actaac in more than 71%;
Figure S2A in Additional file 2), rather than the seven
(TACTAAC) reported for S. cerevisiae [61].
All intron patterns and sequences can be downloaded
from the Génosplicing website [62].
Structural biases in Y. lipolytica introns

We investigated the distribution of introns as a function
of the translation frame of upstream exons (an intron is
considered to be in phase 0 if located between two
codons and in phase 1 or 2 if it splits a codon after the
first or second nucleotide, respectively), intron size and
the number of in-frame stop codons. This analysis highlighted several constraints exerted on the introns interrupting CDS.

First, as previously reported for various eukaryotes
[63,64] most introns were inserted in phase 0 (40.2% of all
introns) or phase 1 (38%), with a highly significant underrepresentation of intron insertions in phase 2 (21.8%; c2 =
64.68, P = 8.98e-15; Figure 2a). The nucleotide environment of the 5'ss has a strong impact on the efficiency of
base-pairing to the U1 snRNA, and the nucleotide
upstream of the 5'ss is particularly important [65,66]. In
Y. lipolytica, this nucleotide is generally a guanosine
(48.5%; Figure S2a in Additional file 2), as also reported
for S. cerevisiae [67]. We looked for a correlation between
intron phase and the presence of G residues upstream of
introns by determining codon usage for the 6,449 genes
of Y. lipolytica. We found that G residues were less frequent in position two within the codon than in positions
one and three (Figure 2b), potentially accounting for the
observed bias in favor of phase 0 and phase 1 introns.
Second, introns of size 3n were underrepresented
(29.4% of all introns versus 35.5% and 35.1% for 3n + 1
and 3n + 2, respectively; Figure 2c). This observation is
consistent with the finding that stop-less 3n introns are
counterselected in Paramecium tetraurelia [50]. In Y.
lipolytica, the underrepresentation of 3n introns seemed
more marked if we considered only the first intron (28.3%
versus 35.85% for each 3n + 1 and 3n + 2 intron), or if we
considered only short introns of 41 to 60 nucleotides
(25.5% versus 34.3% and 40.2% for 3n + 1 and 3n + 2
introns, respectively; Figure 1a). No statistically significant difference was found in the distribution of introns
present in the 5' UTR: 11, 13 and 12 introns of size 3n, 3n
+ 1 and 3n + 2, respectively (Additional file 3).
Third, the proportion of introns containing in-frame
stop codons was very high for 3n (93.7%), 3n + 1 (90.4%)
and 3n + 2 introns (91.8%). The probability of an intron
not containing a PTC (null expectation) in a non-constrained codon string is smaller than 0.05% for any string

Figure 2 Distribution of introns as a function of their length and insertion frame. (a) Introns are represented according to the three possible
frames of the CDS. Phase 0 indicates that the intron is located between two codons, phase 1 indicates that it is located after the first nucleotide of a
codon and phase 2 indicates that it is located after the second nucleotide of a codon. 'All introns' corresponds to the 1,083 introns, 'first introns' to the
first intron of the 951 intron-containing genes and 'other introns' to the 131 second, third, fourth and fifth introns of genes. Differences between insertion phases were statistically significant for all introns (c2 = 64.68, P = 8.98e-15) or for the first introns (c2 = 60.68, P = 6.63e-14) but not for introns
other than the first intron (c2 = 5.50, P = 0.063), probably due to their limited number. (b) The proportions of each of the four bases are represented
for each base of the codons of the 6,449 protein-coding genes. Differences in nucleotide distribution were statistically significant for each position

(c) Introns shown according to length categories, corresponding to a multiple of 3 (3n) or a multiple of 3 plus 1 nucleotides (3n + 1) or plus 2 nucleotides (3n + 2). There were 204 introns ≤60 nucleotides in length. The underrepresentation of 3n introns was statistically significant for all introns (c2 = 7.35, P = 0.025), first introns (c2 = 10.90, P = 0.004) and for introns no
longer than 60 nucleotides (c2 = 6.70, P = 0.034). (d) Stop-free introns are represented according to their insertion frame and length category.

longer than 62 codons (Figure S4 in Additional file 2). We
thus compared the distribution of PTCs in introns
shorter than 186 nucleotides with the expected probability. The proportion of stop-containing introns was higher
than would be expected by chance alone (Figure S4 in
Additional file 2). Thus, stop-free introns are scarce (88
stop-free introns). Their distribution as a function of
length and insertion frame was highly heterogeneous,
with an overrepresentation of stop-free 3n + 1 introns
inserted in phase 0 and of 3n + 2 introns in phase 1 (Figure 2d).
We hypothesized that the unusual intron boundaries in
Y. lipolytica might account for the high frequency of
PTCs in short introns. The 5'ss motif GTGAGT generates
an in-frame stop codon in introns inserted in phase 2,
whatever their size, and this situation applied to 209
introns (19.3% of the 1,083 introns; Figure 3a). Similarly,
GTAAGT, the second most frequent motif, was responsi-

ble for 1% (11 introns) of stop-containing introns in phase
2. The conserved part of the BP motif, CTAAC, also generated stop codons. Assuming that the distance between
the BP and 3'ss motifs (S2 distance) is a mean of one base
(Figure S2 in Additional file 2), three categories of introns
(phase 0 size 3n + 2, phase 1 size 3n + 1 and phase 2 size
n) are most likely to contain in-frame stop codons in BP.
Indeed, 125, 114 and 60 introns, respectively, fell into
these categories (27.6% of all introns; Figure 3b). The
involvement of the BP motif is clearly underestimated, as
the S2 distance may be different from one base (possibly
shorter or longer than one base), making it possible for
introns inserted in other phases to contribute to the presence of an in-frame stop codon in the BP motif. Finally,
the 3'ss TAG is also responsible for the generation of 4%
of stop codons (Figure 3c). These consensus sequences
together account for at least 50% of stop codons. Thus,
the constraints exerted on donor, acceptor and BP motifs

Figure 3 Presence of premature termination codons in spliceosomal introns, as a function of intron size (3n, 3n + 1, 3n + 2)
and insertion frame (frame 0, 1 and 2) within the coding sequence. (a) A PTC is generated for all retained introns inserted in frame
2 and containing GTGAGT or GTAAGT as the 5'ss sequence, whatever
their length; 209 introns are concerned, that is, 19.3% of all intron-containing genes. (b) PTCs (TAA) are also detected in the BP of 3n + 2 introns in frame 0, 3n + 1 introns in frame 1 or 3n introns in frame 2 if the
S2 distance is indeed 1 bp. (c) The main 3'ss is CAG, but, in about 10.5%
of the introns, TAG is also used. This sequence generates a PTC for 3n
introns inserted in frame 0, 3n + 2 introns in frame 1 and 3n + 1 introns
in frame 2. Overall, conserved intron motifs are present in about 50%
of the PTC-containing introns.

are not only necessary for splicing (intron definition
mechanism) but, together with constraints on intron size
and phasing within the codons, also contribute to intron
modeling.
Y. lipolytica uses all modes of alternative splicing

AS events were sought by two different experimental
approaches. First, transcripts of genes with multiple
introns or with large introns (>900 bp) were investigated
by RT-PCR. Subsequently, sequences obtained from
cDNA libraries were screened for splicing variants.
Multi-intronic genes

RT-PCR was carried out on 93 genes of Y. lipolytica for
which in silico predictions for more than one intron had
been made at the beginning of this study (Additional file
5). For 68 of these genes, the predicted spliced transcript

was confirmed and a single mRNA was detected. Two
other gene models (YALI0F03817g and YALI0F31427g)
were poorly predicted and, in both cases, the second
intron was not spliced in any of the three RNA preparations. It was thus considered to be part of an exon, resulting in a monointronic gene model. In nine RT-PCRs, no
result was obtained, due to an absence of PCR product or
non-specific amplification. For two other predicted gene
models (YALI0C07150g and YALI0D04554g), only partial
data were obtained and we were able to confirm only the
splicing of intron 2.
The last 12 RT-PCRs revealed the presence of multiple
transcripts, corresponding to different splicing variants.
For nine of these genes, we observed both transcripts
with retained introns, and transcripts efficiently spliced.
For seven of these transcripts, only the first intron of the
gene was retained, whereas, in one case (YALI0F16753g),
either intron 1 or 2 was retained and, in the last case
(YALI0C15323g), only the second intron was retained.
The last three cases involved both intron retention and
exon skipping events. For YALI0C23496g, we observed
either intron 1 retention, introducing a PTC after 11
codons, or exon 2 skipping, changing the phase of exons 3
and 4 and generating different putative proteins (Figure
4a). For YALI0F26873g, two mRNA variants were
detected in addition to the predicted fully spliced transcript responsible for generating the putative 505 amino
acid protein (Figure 4b). In both alternative transcripts,
exon 3 was skipped either totally (splicing between 5'ss of
intron 2 and 3'ss of intron 3) or partially (alternative 3'ss
of intron 2, leaving 45 nucleotides of exon 3). Both variants retained the stop-free intron 1, which changed the
predicted phase and generated a PTC within exon 2,
thereby resulting in a truncated 259 amino acid protein.
This gene belongs to the large septin family, which has
seven members in Y. lipolytica, as in most hemiascomycetous yeasts. Surprisingly, all but one of the genes in this
family contain at least one intron, the splicing of which
was validated by cDNA clones. YALI0F26873g is the only
gene of this family with three introns and the only member of the family with alternative transcripts. Mitrovich et
al. [16] observed that three of the seven septins of C. albicans contained introns and suggested that AS might play
an important role in their regulation, consistent with our
findings.
Genes bearing long introns (>900 bp)

Long introns are rare in S. cerevisiae, with all but five of
the introns in this species being less than 700 nucleotides
long and the largest intron being 1,002 bp long. In Y.
lipolytica, gene model predictions indicate that there are
61 introns of more than 700 nucleotides in length, with a
maximal intron size of 3,478 bp (see detailed analysis
below). We focused on the genes with the largest introns,
with a view to confirming these predictions. For this pur-

Figure 4 Schematic representation of alternative transcripts from multi-intronic genes. Gene models include exons, represented by gray rectangles and introns, symbolized by thin black articulated lines. Vertical bars on each of the three phases (0, +1 and +2) represent an in-frame stop
codon. The resulting mRNA variants are depicted as a concatenation of exons and the thick black vertical line represents the first in-frame codon of
the transcript. The size of the putative proteins derived from each splicing variant is indicated on the right. All three genes generate at least three
different splicing variants. (a) YALI0C23496g mRNAs are subject to intron retention (intron 1) or exon skipping (exon 2). The retention of intron 1 generates a PTC and a putative peptide of 11 amino acids. Exon 2 skipping generates a frameshift in exon 3 and in exon 4, which is slightly shortened
(exon 4'), and generates a putative protein of 65 amino acids. (b) YALI0F26873g splicing variants display retained intron 1, alternative 3'ss (intron 2)
usage or the skipping of exon 3. Both variants with a retained intron 1 generate a PTC in exon 2 and a putative truncated protein of 259 amino acids.
(c) In YALI0F32043g mRNAs, the retention of intron 5 and the use of an alternative 3'ss do not generate a PTC or a frame shift in that intron 5 is a multiple of three (60 nucleotides) nucleotides long and the difference between E4 and E4' is also a multiple of three (15 nucleotides). Both variants generate a putative protein of about the same size as that generated by the fully spliced transcript. Considering the large size of exon 6, it is shown
truncated with horizontal dashed lines.

pose, 17 introns exceeding 900 bp in length (from 901 to
1,551 bp) were reverse-transcribed and amplified with
specific primers and mRNA extracted from cells grown
under the three different sets of conditions. Thirteen of
these introns were spliced as expected, one was not
amplified (cDNA clones revealed a different gene model
with no introns), two were found to have been poorly predicted (intron size larger than expected) and the last
intron, in YALI0F32043g, was found to be a mosaic of five
introns and exons (Additional file 6). Transcripts of this
last gene displayed AS due to alternative 3'ss selection
(extending exon 4 by 15 bases) and retention of the 60
nucleotides, stop-free intron 5 (Figure 4c; Additional file
5). The observed AS events did not generate in-frame
stop codons and did not modify the translation phase.
They may result in the generation of different, putatively
functional proteins.
Nine additional long introns were detected during the
cDNA analysis. The most interesting of these introns was
found in YALI0D18403g. Two transcription start sites
were found, one located 179 bases upstream of the methionine initiation codon and enabling the transcription of
a single exon (Figure 5a), and the other located about 3 kb
upstream and giving rise to a transcript with a 3,478-base
intron (Figure 5b). Surprisingly, a CDS of 1,062 bases (353
amino acids) of unknown function was predicted within
this intron and shown to be highly conserved in the
genomes of closely related species (data not shown).

(a)

All these results demonstrate the efficient splicing of
long introns not necessarily predicted in silico.
cDNA libraries

The three cDNA libraries were screened for the presence
of alternative transcripts and, more specifically, for the
presence/absence of the 1,083 introns. Eighty-six introns
matched cDNA sequences entirely or partially. For nine
of these introns, mRNAs were found in an antisense orientation. Sixty-one of the remaining 75 intron sequences
corresponded to the retention of the first (58 cases) or
second (3 cases) intron of the gene. Matches for the last
14 intron sequences revealed more complex situations,
involving alternative transcription start sites, alternative
5' and 3'ss usage, exon skipping, internal exon and intron
retention or combinations of these mechanisms (Additional file 7). For example, in YALI0B15598g, which is
highly expressed (24, 9 and 28 cDNA in expo, stat and
oleic conditions, respectively), exon 2 was mostly skipped
(46 cDNAs versus 2 in which introns 1 and 2 were both
efficiently spliced). Exon 2 skipping is facilitated by the
presence of suboptimal sequences for intron 1 BP
(TGCTCAC) and intron 2 5'ss (GTCAGC). As exon 2 is
39 bp long, both variants encode putative proteins (Figure 6a) homologous to GND1 and GDN2 from S. cerevisiae, two 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases catalyzing
an NADPH-regenerating reaction in the pentose phosphate pathway. These proteins are highly conserved in
fungi, with the exception of the amino-terminal domain
(Figure 6b). Comparisons of gene models showed the

TSS1 is located about 3 kb upstream of TSS2 and initiates a transcript with a 3,478-nucleotide intron. Surprisingly, this intron overlaps YALI0D18436g,
a CDS of 1,062 bases the translation of which generates a putative 353 amino acid protein of unknown function. Translation of the YALI0D18403g2
mRNAs generates a putative protein of 1,424 amino acids.

are represented by gray or black (skipped exon) rectangles and introns by thin black lines. The size of the putative protein is 502 amino acids when
intron 1 and intron 2 are efficiently spliced, or 489 amino acids when exon 2 is skipped. (b) Amino acid alignment of the amino-terminal domain of
fungal and yeast proteins, homologs of YALI0B15598g. The size of this domain is given in amino acids, on the right, for each protein (from 20 to 41).
The black rectangle groups together hemiascomycetous yeasts or ascomycetous filamentous fungi. Archiascomycetes are represented by S. pombe
and basidiomycetes by Ustilago maydis. The numbers of spliced introns (column on the right) are colored identically when intron positions are conserved within genes: blue for most hemiascomycetous yeasts, red for Y. lipolytica, green for all ascomycetous filamentous fungi, yellow for S. pombe
and black for U. maydis. (c) Intron localization. Triangles indicate the position of the introns for the different groups of genes (same colors as in (b)).

presence of a large number of introns at different sites in
the various fungal phyla (Figure 6c). Only intron 4 of
YALI0B15598g was found to be conserved in all the
basidiomycetes, archiascomycetes and filamentous ascomycetes studied (Figure 6c). Intron 1 of S. pombe and
Ustilago maydis is located at the same position, which
differs by few nucleotides from that of Y. lipolytica intron
2 or of the single intron retained in some other hemiasco-

mycetous species, such as Arxula adeninivorans, Lachancea kluyveri and Debaryomyces hansenii. Thus,
YALI0B15598g may represent an interesting example of
intron acquisition or intron slippage.
The different strategies used to detect alternative transcripts in Y. lipolytica revealed that such variants were
generated from at least 88 genes (Additional files 7 and 8).
All known modes of AS were observed: alternative 5'ss (3

Mekouar et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R65
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/6/R65

genes) and 3'ss usage (6 genes), exon skipping (4 genes)
and intron retention (76 genes). Alternative transcription
start sites within or downstream of introns were detected
in seven genes. Alternative transcripts were observed for
9.2% of the intron-containing genes, but for only 1.8% of
these genes if intron retention was excluded. Most of the
variants observed resulted from intron retention and, if
only multi-intronic genes were considered, the intron
retained was mostly the first intron (15 of 21 genes). In
almost all cases, intron-containing transcripts revealed
by our experimental approaches, carried a PTC. This type
of mRNA is generally detected by the NMD pathway, a
quality control mechanism that recognizes and degrades
PTC-containing transcripts, preventing their translation.
The NMD machinery exists in Y. lipolytica, but some
effectors are lacking

The presence and efficiency of NMD was investigated in
Y.
lipolytica.
Homologs
of
UPF1
(YlUPF1,
YALI0D23881g) and UPF2 (YlUPF2, YALI0E24629g)
were detected in the Y. lipolytica genome by searches for
similarity to known genes. UPF3, which is less well conserved in eukaryotes than UPF1 or UPF2, was not
detected in the chromosomes or in any non-assembled
reads, suggesting that this NMD effector is lacking or
highly divergent in Y. lipolytica. We also looked for
SMG1, SMG5, SMG6 and SMG7 (EBS1 in S. cerevisiae),
but failed to detect any homologs in Y. lipolytica.
The YALI0D23881g and YALI0E24629g genes, encoding YlUPF1 and YlUPF2, were entirely deleted from the
laboratory strain PO1d. None of the single-deletion
mutants for these genes displayed a growth defect under
the conditions tested, and no defect was observed for the
double-mutant (Figure S5 in Additional file 2). This result
is consistent with the absence of a growth defect in S. cerevisiae strains lacking the UPF1 or UPF2 gene [68,69],
suggesting that NMD is not an essential biological mechanism in yeasts.
The efficiency of NMD in Y. lipolytica was assessed by
comparing the levels of PTC-containing transcripts in
wild-type and mutant strains. RT-PCR was performed on
four populations of mRNAs (YALI0B011154g,
YALI0C23496g, YALI0D05041g and YALI0F16752g) displaying intron retention and resulting in the generation of
a PTC, and four populations of efficiently spliced mRNAs
(YALI0B15598g, YALI0E20031g, YALI0F03179g and
YALI0F09669g). In the efficiently spliced mRNAs, we
found no difference in the ratio of efficiently spliced to
unspliced transcripts between the wild-type and the
mutant strains (Figure S6 in Additional file 2). Among the
second set of genes, YALI0D05041g and YALI0F16752g
showed a very low level of intron retention, which did not
increase in NMD mutants (Figure S6 in Additional file 2).
This observation suggests that both genes are probably

Page 11 of 17

not subjected to the NMD pathway. In contrast, for
YALI0C23496g and YALI0B11154g the ratios of spliced
and unspliced transcripts clearly differed between wildtype and mutant strains. The intensity of the RT-PCR
product for the unspliced transcript was clearly higher in
NMD mutants (the unspliced/spliced (R/S) ratio
increased from 0.09 to 0.35 for YALI0B11154g and from
0.07 to 1.82 for YALI0C23496g; Figure 7a). Thus, despite
the lack of a conserved UPF3 homolog, NMD is functional in Y. lipolytica and unspliced transcripts of
YALI0C23496g and YALI0B11154g are targeted by this
degradation pathway.
We also focused on the homolog of YDR381W (YRA1),
which is known to encode an mRNA not targeted by the
NMD pathway in S. cerevisiae [41,42]. Homologs of the
YRA1 gene are conserved in all hemiascomycetous yeasts

upf1::LEU2 clone 7; lane 4, upf1::LEU2 clone C) and one UPF2 knockout
(lane 5: upf2::LEU2 clone 7). The intensity of the unspliced transcripts is

the spliced transcript (S) in all strains and an additional splicing variant
in NMD- mutants only. This variant corresponds to the retention of intron 1 (R). Hybridization with intron 1 confirmed that this intron is retained only in NMD- mutants, whereas it is efficiently spliced out in

and present a long intron, the BP motif of which diverges
from the canonical sequence in almost all species [41].
The Y. lipolytica gene model for the YRA1 homolog
(YALI0A20867g) follows this rule: the first intron is 850
bp long and its BP sequence, located three bases
upstream of the 3'ss motif, is TGCTGAC. RT-PCR validated the splicing of the intron in wild-type and mutant
strains but identified no transcripts in which intron 1 was
retained. However, as the difference in the lengths of the
spliced and unspliced forms may bias the PCR in favor of
the spliced variant, northern blots were performed with
probes binding to exons or the first intron (Figure 7b).
Given that YRA1 mRNA degradation requires Xrn1p in S.
cerevisiae [42], we also included a YlXRN1 mutant in our
analysis. In hybridization studies, we observed a higher
intensity of the bands corresponding to intron-retained
transcripts in NMD- mutants only. No such increase in
intensity was observed for the YlXRN1 mutant. This
observation suggests that, as in S. cerevisiae, the YlYRA1
transcript is not efficiently spliced in Y. lipolytica. We also
found that, by contrast to what has been reported for S.
cerevisiae, unspliced transcripts were targeted by the
NMD pathway, and their degradation seemed to be independent of the YlXrn1 protein. These results suggest that
the S. cerevisiae YRA1 autoregulation mechanism based
on the nuclear export and cytoplasmic Edc3p-mediated
decay of the unspliced transcript [42], is probably not
conserved in Y. lipolytica.

Discussion
Hemiascomycetous yeasts are considered to have intronpoor genomes. We show here that despite this intron
paucity, Y. lipolytica has four times as many introns as S.
cerevisiae and is the hemiascomycetous genome with the
largest number of intron-containing genes sequenced to
date. The combination of approaches used made it possible to correct many predicted gene models, to identify
new genes, such as SOA genes [51], to confirm the splicing of many introns, including both large introns and
introns from weakly expressed genes, and to detect
introns in 5' UTRs. From a structural point of view, the
genome annotation of Y. lipolytica is now largely validated by experimental data and provides a reliable
genome model complementary to that of S. cerevisiae.
We show here that Y. lipolytica produces alternative
transcripts through several different mechanisms: intron
retention, exon skipping, 3' and 5' alternative splice site
usage and the use of alternative promoters. The frequency of AS in Y. lipolytica is not very high, particularly
if intron retention is excluded from the analysis (1.8% of
intron-containing genes), but remains higher than that
reported for S. cerevisiae or other hemiascomycetous
yeasts, in which few naturally occurring cases
[16,26,27,29,31,38,39] or experimentally induced exam-

Page 12 of 17

ples [70,71] have been described. Additional cases have
been detected in yeasts, thanks to the recent development of genome-wide technologies providing information about transcript polymorphism, such as tiling or
RNA-seq approaches, but these cases mostly involve
intron retention [32-34]. We report here a few interesting
examples of exon skipping, alternative 3'ss usage or presence of an intronic gene, the expression of which depends
on an alternative promoter. The situation is quite different in basidiomycetous yeasts, such as Cryptococcus neoformans, which has an intron-rich genome (mean of 5.3
introns per gene) and a high frequency of AS, with high
levels of intron retention [72] but 4.2% of the transcripts
nonetheless resulting from exon skipping and alternative
3'ss or 5'ss usage [73].
In Y. lipolytica, intron retention is the main model by
which mRNA variants are generated, consistent with previous findings for ascomycetous fungi [74,75]. However,
the particular involvement of the first intron in intron
retention has not been reported before, probably because
AS was investigated mostly in hemiascomycetous yeasts
with very few multi-intronic genes [14]. It would be interesting to perform a similar analysis in other phyla of ascomycetous fungi or in basidiomycetes. If this phenomenon
reflects an ancestral trait, then the bias should be more
marked in filamentous fungi known to possess intronrich genomes.
One of the key questions emerging from our study
relates to whether intron retention in Y. lipolytica plays a
physiological role, as observed for YRA1 or meiotic genes
in S. cerevisiae, or reflects an underlying background of
splicing failure. We addressed this question by investigating whether the retained introns were different from
other introns, including, specifically, whether their 5'ss,
3'ss or BP were degenerate or whether the introns were
particularly long, potentially accounting for the low splicing efficiency (Additional file 8). However, no bias was
detected in primary structure, except that the first intron
of YRA1 had a degenerate BP, as it does in S. cerevisiae
[41]. More recently, YRA1 splicing inhibition has been
reported to be regulated by YRA1 exon 1, in a size-dependent but sequence-independent manner [42]. We thus
investigated the size of exon 1 (coding exon plus 5' UTR)
in inefficiently spliced transcripts but, again, no bias was
detected. Another possibility, requiring further investigation for Y. lipolytica introns, stems from the reported correlation between splicing efficiency and the spatial
distance between 5'ss and BP [76,77]. It has been suggested that a zipper stem in the secondary structure of
three large introns of S. cerevisiae shortens the S1 distance and facilitates spliceosome assembly [77].
However, as the first intron is more often retained than
downstream introns, it is tempting to speculate that, in
most cases, intron retention probably results from a

Mekouar et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R65
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/6/R65

defect in the kinetics of spliceosome recruitment by the
polymerase or in spliceosome assembly. Indeed, in S. cerevisiae [78], as in other eukaryotes, splicing is mostly
cotranscriptional [79]. It has also been shown that the
efficiency of splicing factor recruitment during transcription may influence splicing efficiency [80] and that the
carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of
polymerase II is involved in this mechanism. We can thus
speculate that retention of the first intron of transcripts
may result from a defect in the recruitment of the spliceosome by polymerase II during transcription. We are
currently investigating this hypothesis in Y. lipolytica and
determining whether there is a correlation between
intron retention and the binding kinetics of introns, splicing factors and CTD.
Almost all the observed unspliced transcripts included
a premature termination codon. During the first round of
translation (before degradation by NMD), the ribosome
is thus likely to be rapidly stopped by the PTC because
the introns concerned were mostly located at the 5' end of
the CDS, close to the start codon. A statistical analysis of
the structural characteristics of Y. lipolytica introns
(intron size, frame of integration within the coding
sequence, PTC) revealed that up to 93% of introns generated a PTC, whereas only about 30% of introns in Paramecium generate PTCs [50]. This high percentage is due
to both intron size and, in half the cases, the sequence of
intron boundaries. The presence of stop codons in 5'ss
motifs is unusual for yeast introns, as the most frequent
motif in the hemiascomycete genomes sequenced to date
is GTATGT [14,61], but the 5'ss motif in Y. lipolytica is
GTGAGT. This observation highlights a specific evolution of intron features in Y. lipolytica, as proposed for various intron-poor lineages with strong 5'ss [60]. Introns of
size 3n were also found to be underrepresented, and stopfree 3n introns were particularly strongly underrepresented, as previously reported for other eukaryotes [50].
If retained, 3n stop-free introns do not change the translation frame and are thus considered as coding sequences
that may affect the structure and activity of the resulting
protein, with possible deleterious consequences for the
cell. In Y. lipolytica, the small number of 3n introns was
particularly pronounced for short introns, probably
reflecting an ancestral situation in which introns were
numerous and short [20]. Intron size has increased during the course of evolution in yeasts, including Y. lipolytica in particular, to a much greater extent than in
filamentous ascomycetes. This size increase has
increased the likelihood of introns containing a PTC,
potentially limiting the need for specific constraints on
intron size (3n, 3n + 1, 3n + 2).
In eukaryotes, mRNAs with PTCs are subject to NMD,
a quality-control mechanism directing PTC-containing
transcripts for degradation to prevent their translation

Page 13 of 17

(for reviews, see [43-45]). As most Y. lipolytica transcripts
containing retained introns also contain PTCs, this would
suggest that such transcripts are mostly targeted by
NMD. This may account for their lack of detection in
assays with wild-type strains, in which they were probably degraded by the NMD pathway too rapidly for detection. We therefore investigated whether NMD was active
in Y. lipolytica. Genes for only two of the core NMD factors were detected in the sequenced strain, YlUPF1 and
YlUPF2. This situation is exceptional among eukaryotes,
as all other organisms in which NMD has been studied
possess at least three major effectors (UPF1/SMG2,
UPF2/SMG3 and UPF3/SMG4). Deleting YlUPF1 or
YlUPF2 resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of unspliced transcripts for some, but not all introncontaining genes. This result confirms the existence of a
functional NMD pathway in Y. lipolytica. However, the
absence of significant growth defects in YlUPF1 and
YlUPF2 mutants suggests that NMD is not an essential
mechanism, as in S. cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans, whereas it has been shown to be essential in plants
and metazoans (for a review, see [43]). We now aim to
determine, at the whole-genome scale, which genes are
targets of NMD and how this pathway is regulated in this
yeast.

Conclusions
We present here an extensive survey of the transcriptome
of a yeast chosen for this study on the basis of its phylogenetic position, far removed from all other hemiascomycetous yeasts sequenced to date. This in-depth analysis of
the transcriptome made it possible to improve the structural annotation of the Y. lipolytica genome and identified
complex cases of alternative transcripts. With a genome
slightly more complex than that of S. cerevisiae in terms
of gene structure, together with its genetic and biochemical tractability, Y. lipolytica may be a valuable organism
for studies of the regulation of AS and its impact on the
evolution of gene structure. Although considered an
intron-poor species, Y. lipolytica nonetheless displays significant biases in its intron structure, generating PTCs in
cases of intron retention. However, further comparative
studies at a larger phylogenetic scale are clearly required
to determine whether the modeling of intron-containing
genes corresponds to an ancestral characteristic or to an
evolutionary phenomenon acquired in this particular lineage.
Materials and methods
Strains and media

Y. lipolytica strains E150 (CLIB122, MATB his-1 leu2-270
ura3-302 xpr2-322) and PO1d (CLIB139, MatA leu2-270
ura3-302 xpr2-322) were routinely grown at 28°C on YPD
(yeast extract, peptone and glucose, 10 g/l each) or YNB

Mekouar et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R65
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/6/R65

(1.7 g/l Yeast Nitrogen Base (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA), 10
g/l glucose) supplemented for auxotrophy if necessary.
Oleic acid medium was prepared as follows: 1.7 g/l Yeast
Nitrogen Base (Difco), 50 g/l NH4Cl, 50 mM PO4NaK pH
6.8, a 100 ml/l emulsion of oleic acid (oleic acid 20% (v/v),
0.625% (v/v) Tween 40), 0.8 g/l yeast extract, 10 g/l glucose. Growth phenotypes were investigated for mutant
strains of PO1d, on YPD and YNB medium, at 28°C and
18°C.
RNA extraction and RT-PCR

The RNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) was
used to extract total RNA from cells grown in three different conditions: exponential growth phase in YPD
(called 'expo'), stationary phase in YPD ('stat') and exponential growth phase in oleic acid medium ('oleic'). DNA
contamination was eliminated with the Turbo DNA-free
kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, Texas, USA).
RT-PCR was performed with Ready-To-Go™ RT-PCR
Beads (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Orsay, France) and
PCR control with PuReTaq Ready-To-Go™ PCR Beads
(GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Primers for RT-PCR were
designed so as to obtain a 200-bp amplicon after splicing.
The resulting amplicons were subsequently inserted into
a Bluescript plasmid and sequenced to identify the different splicing variants. The relative intensities of RT-PCR
products were estimated from ethidium bromide-stained
gels, with the ImageJ software developed at the National
Institutes of Health [81].
Northern blotting

About 20 μg of RNA was separated by electrophoresis in
a 1.2% agarose gel in 1× FA buffer (20 mM morpholinepropanesulfonic acid, 5 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM
EDTA, pH 7) supplemented with 1.8% formaldehyde.
After electrophoresis, the RNAs were transferred onto
GeneScreen nylon membranes (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences, Courtaboeuf, France), as previously described [82].
DNA probes were amplified by PCR from the genomic
DNA of strain E150. PCR products were purified by electrophoresis in a 1% low-melting point agarose gel. DNA
probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP, with the Amersham Megaprime™ DNA labeling kit (GE Healthcare Life
Sciences, Orsay, France), and hybridizations were performed in Denhardt's solution-containing buffer at 65°C
[83]. Final washes were performed at 65°C, in 0.2 × SSC (1
× SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate)-0.1%
sodium dodecyl sulfate.
cDNA library construction and sequencing

Total RNA was extracted from cells grown in three different sets of culture conditions (expo, stat and oleic; see
above). We isolated mRNA from the total RNA preparation with the Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen) and the three
libraries were constructed with the CloneMiner™ cDNA
Library Construction Kit (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise,
France), based on Gateway® technology. The resulting

Page 14 of 17

libraries were highly enriched in full-length, oriented
clones. We sequenced 28,434 clones (9,409, 9,620 and
9,405 clones for the expo, stat and oleic libraries, respectively) by the Sanger method, first from the 5' end of the
cloning cDNAs and then from the 3' end for 1,414 chosen
clones. For 1,004 of these 1,414 selected clones, 5' and 3'
sequences have been assembled, whereas for the remaining 410 clones, the 5' and 3' sequences were deposited
individually in the EMBL database. The accession numbers
for the resulting 28,844 sequences are [EMBL:FP671140EMBL:FP680548], [EMBL:FP680607-EMBL:FP690338]
and [EMBL:FP690350-EMBL:FP700052] for the expo,
stat and oleic libraries, respectively.
Gene deletion

The complete deletion of Y. lipolytica genes (YlUPF1,
YALI0D23881g; YlUPF2, YALI0E24629g; YlXRN1,
YALI0C23144g) was performed as previously described
[84]. Primers for the PCR amplification of promoter (P)
and terminator (T) regions are listed in Additional file 9.
The ML and/or MU cassettes [84] were introduced into
the PT cassette. PO1d cells were transformed by the lithium acetate method [85], with about 400 ng of purified
DNA from the disruption cassettes. Transformants were
selected on YNB medium supplemented with NH4Cl (5
g/l), sodium potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 (50
mM), agar (2%) and uracyl (100 mg/ml) or leucine (100
mg/ml). Gene deletion was checked by PCR, with primers external to the disruption cassette, upstream from P
and downstream from T.
Auxotrophic mutants were complemented with the
URA3 or LEU2 cassettes, for comparison of their growth
rates with that of the wild-type strain, W29.
Genome sequence and sequence analysis

At the beginning of this study, the genome annotation of
Y. lipolytica strain E150 included 6,703 CDSs (genes and
pseudogenes [1]) and 742 introns (First annotation version 3 July 2004). The genomic sequence and the different
versions of the genome annotation of Y. lipolytica strain
E150, including the version updated with our data, are
available from the Génolevures database [52].
The sequences of the cDNA clones were compared
with sequences in a nucleotide sequence database of Y.
lipolytica CDS using BLAST [86]. Only the first hit was
considered if the expected value was lower than 1.e-100
or between 1.e-50 and 1.e-100 with an identity score
exceeding 95%.
DNA logos were created with WEBLOGO version 2.8.1
[87,88].
