Abstract
Background: Avian Leukosis virus (ALV) of subgroup J (ALV-J) belong to retroviruses, which could induce tumors
in domestic and wild birds. Myelocytomatosis was the most common neoplasma observed in infected flocks;
however, few cases of hemangioma caused by ALV-J were reported in recent year.
Results: An ALV-J strain SCDY1 associated with hemangioma was isolated and its proviral genomic sequences
were determined. The full proviral sequence of SCDY1 was 7489 nt long. Homology analysis of the env, pol and
gag gene between SCDY1 and other strains in GenBank were 90.3-94.2%, 96.6-97.6%, and 94.3-96.5% at nucleotide
level, respectively; while 85.1-90.7%, 97.4-98.7%, and 96.2-98.4% at amino acid level, respectively. Alignment analysis
of the genomic sequence of ALV-J strains by using HPRS-103 as reference showed that a special 11 bp deletion
was observed in U3 region of 3’UTR of SCDY1 and another ALV-J strain NHH isolated from case of hemangioma,
and the non-functional TM and E element were absent in the genome of SCDY1, but the transcriptional regulatory
elements including C/EBP, E2BP, NFAP-1, CArG box and Y box were highly conserved. Phylogenetic analysis
revealed that all analyzed ALV-J strains could be separated into four groups, and SCDY1 as well as another strain
NHH were included in the same cluster.
Conclusion: The variation in envelope glycoprotein was higher than other genes. The genome sequence of SCDY1
has a close relationship with that of another ALV-J strain NHH isolated from case of hemangioma. A 11 bp deletion
observed in U3 region of 3’UTR of genome of ALV-J isolated from case of hemangioma is interesting, which may
be associated with the occurrence of hemangioma.

Background
Avian Leucosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) was first
reported in 1989 from commercial meat-type chickens
with myelocytomatosis [1]. It is a novel subgroup different from classical ALV subgroup A, B, C, D and E, and
a recombinant between exogenous avian leukosis viruses
(ALVs) and the endogenous avian retrovirus (EAV)
family of EAVs [2,3]. ALV-J could be transmitted from
broiler breeders to progeny more frequently than other
ALV subgroups by Vertical transmission [4], and has
caused severe economic losses in breeding farms all

over the world. Recent studies showed that the host
range of ALV-J had been largely widened, it could infect
not only broilers but also commercial layers. Meanwhile,
some new clinical pathotypes were observed in diseased
flocks, such as hemangioma, which might be observed
on the skin of the trunk, digitus, joint, wing and internal
organs.
In China, the type of neoplasma induced by ALV-J
was mainly myeloma leucosis (ML), and it occurred
mainly in white meat-type chickens [5]. However, few
cases of hemangioma caused by ALV subgroup J were
reported in recent years [6,7], and they were diagnosed
mainly by histopathological examination and PCR detection. To updates, two complete proviral genomic
sequences of ALV-J strain associated with hemangioma

were reported, which were NHH (HM235668) and
JL0901 (not published in NCBI).
In 2009, an infectious disease occurred in a grandparent breeding farm in Sichuan province of China, characteristics mainly of weakness, inappetance and
emaciation. Hemangioma was observed in the digiti of
the sick. The gross pathology seen in organs of diseased
chickens included hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and
gray-white nodules of various sizes on the surface of the
liver, but no myeloma leucosis was observed. In this
study, an ALV-J strain SCDY1 was isolated from the
blood samples of the diseased chickens, and its complete
genome sequence was amplified and analyzed, which
should be helpful for the research on the pathogenesis
of hemangioma induced by ALV-J.

conducted until the result of PCR detection of cellular
genome and RT-PCR detection of supernatant were
both positive.

Methods

Genomic DNA extract and PCR amplification

Chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF)

The total DNA was extracted from chicken embryo
fibroblast (CEF) infected with virus by using a sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS) - proteinase K and phenol/chloroform/isoamylol (25:24:1) protocol. Genomic DNA PCR
amplification was performed according to the manual of
rTaq kit (Takara, Dalian, China), by using the proviral
genomic DNA as template. Primers pairs 1-8 were used
to amplify the internal region of SCDY1 genome; while
primer pair 9 was used to amplify the LTRs of circular
DNA by using total DNA of CEF infected by SCDY1 for
8-24 h as templates. The optimum conditions for PCR
were as follows: 94°C for 4 min, ten cycles at 94°C for
35 s, 55°C for 35 s (a decrease of 0.5°C per cycle), 72°C
for 40 s and followed by 20 cycles at 94°C for 35 s, 50°C
for 35 s, 72°C for 40 s and a final elongation at 72°C for

Specific-pathogen-free (SPF) eggs were obtained from
the Beijing experimental animal center (Merial Inc.,
Beijing, China) and hatched at our lab. Ten-day-old
chicken embryos were used to prepare the Chicken
embryo fibroblast (CEF) cell cultures.
Virus isolation

The whole blood sample was inoculated onto the CEF
monolayers prepared from 11-day-old embryonated
eggs, and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for five days
for each passage. Uninfected CEF monolayers were used
as negative control. After one blind passage, the existence of ALV-J in CEF was verified by PCR detection of
545 bp repeated sequence. Three blind passage were

Primers

First, a pair of primers designed by smith [8] was
synthesized and used to detect the proviral genomic
DNA of ALV-J in infected CEF, or the viral RNA of
ALV-J in the supernatant of infected CEF. Next, nine
pairs of primers (Table 1) were designed according to
the published sequences of HPRS-103 to amplify nine
fragments which overlapped with each other and covered the whole genome of ALV-J. The ninth pair was
used specifically to amplify the LTRs of circular DNA of
ALV-J.

infected CEF were positive in PCR detection, and the
supernatant of infected CEF was positive in RT-PCR
detection (data not shown), indicating the existence of
proviral genomic DNA of ALV-J in infected CEF and
ALV in the supernatant of infected CEF.

10 min. The PCR product was analyzed in 1% agarose in
Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer gel containing 0.5 mg/
ml ethidium bromide.
Cloning and sequencing of proviral genomic DNA of
SCDY1

The PCR products were isolated from agarose gels and
purified using E.Z.N. ATM Gel Extraction Kit (TaKaRa,
Japan), then cloned into pMD19-T vector (Takara,
Dalian) and transformed into DH5a E. Coli competent
cell. Confirmation of clones containing recombinant
plasmid was achieved by PCR and restriction enzyme
(RE) digestion. The recombinant plasmid was sequenced
by Shanghai Sanggong Biologiucal Engineering Tachnology & Services Co., Ltd (shanghai, China).

PCR amplification of proviral genome

Total DNA from SCDY1-infected CEF was used as PCR
templates, and nine DNA fragments with the expected
sizes of 0.614, 1.16, 1.098, 1.191, 1.376, 0.745, 1.921,
0.968, 0.466 kb long were amplified (data not shown).
Sequence analysis of the proviral genome of SCDY1

Sequences of the PCR products were aligned by using
the EDITSEQ program in DNAstar software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI 53715, USA). The complete
proviral genome sequence of SCDY1, compiled from
sequences of nine overlapping DNA fragments, was
7489 nt in length, and submitted to GenBank under
accession No. HQ425636. The structure of SCDY1 proviral genome was presented in Figure 1.
Comparisons of the long terminal repeat (LTR)
sequence showed that the LTR of SCDY1 shared a
homology of 89.8-92.7% with these of other reference
strains, and the LTR sequences of strains HPRS-103 and
HN had the highest homology with these of SCDY1
(Table 3).
Comparisons of the three major structural genes
revealed that the homology of nucleotide sequence of
env, pol and gag gene between SCDY1 and other isolates in GenBank were 90.3-94.2%, 96.6-97.6% and 94.396.5%, respectively, and the homology of amino acid
sequence of env, pol and gag gene between SCDY1 and
other isolates in GenBank were 85.1-90.7%, 97.4-98.7%
and 96.2-98.4%, respectively. The gag and pol genes of

Sequence analysis

The complete genome sequences of the isolate was
compared with these of other ALV-J strains published
in GenBank, including Chinese strains isolated from
white broilers and commercial layers by using the Clustal W method in MegAlign program of the DNASTAR
package. Transcriptional regulatory elements in U3 were
analyzed by the online service system of NSITE (Recognition of Regulatory motifs) of Soft Berry (http://linux1.
softberry.com/berry.phtml). Phylogenetic analysis of the
complete proviral sequences of ALV-J was performed
with the neighbor-joining method using MEGA version
4.0. The background of the reference strains used in this
study and their accession numbers are listed in table 2.

Discussion
ALV-J has spread all over the world and caused severe
economic losses in broiler breeder flocks since it was
isolated [5,9-11]. It can infect all species of chicken, but
the types of neoplasma and the morbidity vary in different cases. The most common neoplasma observed in
infected flocks was myeloid leucosis (ML) [12]; however,
myelocytomas are not exclusive to ALV-J, other types of
neoplasma such as histiocytic sarcomatosis, feather
abnormalities, myelocyte infiltration in bones, hemangioma has also been reported [13-16]. Hemangioma has
been even the most common neoplasm in broiler breeders in the UK [17], and an outbreak of hemangioma
with 20% mortalities in young white Leghorn layers in
Israel has also been reported [18]. In China, hemangioma was observed in several commercial layer flocks
infected by ALV-J during 2007-2009 [19].
In this paper, a field ALV-J strain named as SCDY1
was isolated and its the complete proviral genome
nucleotide sequence was determined. It contains 7489
nt with no EcoR I site, which could be found in the genome of NHH strain isolated from case of hemangioma.
Homology analysis of the genes of SCDY1 and other
reference strains showed that the envelope gene of
ALV-J was prone to evolve compared to gag and pol
genes, as the identity of the env gene between strain
SCDY1 and other strains ranged from 90.3% to 94.2% at
the nucleotides level and from 85.1% to 90.7% at the
amino acid level respectively, lower than these of gag
and pol genes.
The 3’UTR of avian retroviruses is important in viral
pathogenesis and replication, the LTR enclosed within
the 3’ UTR contains powerful transcription regulatory
elements that might differ among viruses and determine
the virulence [20]. According to sequences analysis,
the transcriptional regulatory elements of U3 region
of SCDY1 genoem contained several transcriptional

elements such as C/EBP, E2BP, CArG box and Y box,
which played an important role in the efficient transcription of virus; while, NFAP-1 was not observed in
SCDY1 genome, and it could be found in these of other
analyzed strains. NFAP-1 could be recognized by the
activator protein 1 (AP-1), and AP-1 is a heterodimeric
protein composed of proteins belonging to the c-Fos, cJun, ATF and JDP families. It regulates gene expression
in response to a variety of stimuli, including cytokines,
growth factors, stress, and bacterial and viral infections
[21]. The absent of NFAP-1 might affect the infection
abilities of ALV-J virus.
Most of non-functional TM and E element of SCDY1
in 3’UTR were absent, which shared identical deletions
with some ML strains isolated from meat-type chickens;
while, the deletion of E element in SCDY1 genome was
not observed in the genome of another strain NHH isolated from case of hemangioma. The E element has
been found exclusively in some of the sarcoma viruses
and ALV-J [22-24]. It may play a role in oncogenesis
based on its close association with the src gene; however, it seemed not to be essential for oncogenesis,
because other related oncogenic avian retroviruses lack
the E element [25]. Therefore, the pathogenicity
of SCDY1 may be unaffected by the deletion of TM and
E element. The occurrence of hemangioma may be

associated with multiple factors such as genetic backgroud, environment, concomitant infections, immunocompetence and the mode of transmission.
Interestingly, a special 11 bp deletion was observed in
the U3 region of ALV-J strains associated with hemangioma. Online service analysis showed that a sequence
“TGATCAT” within this special 11 bp region of U3 of
ALV-J strains other than SCDY1 was a transcriptional
regulatory element ABI REP1, which was the regulatory
factor of human gene Apo-AI and function in the process of recognition of regulatory motifs. One binding
factor of ABI REP1 named as HNF-4 was also found,
and it served as an inhibitor modulator and played an
important role in the regulation of eukaryotic genes.
Although the special 11 bp deletion did not locate in
CArG box, PRE box or Y box, its appearance may
played a role in the transcriptional regulation of ALV-J
genes, further study such as reverse genetics should be
taken to test its function in oncogenesis.
So far, there are few proviral genomic sequence of
ALV-J strains associated with hemangioma have been
reported, the sequence comparison and phylogenetic
analysis of SCDY1 and other ALV-J strains may help to
reveal the evolution rhythm of ALV-J strains prevalent
in fields, and benefit for the research on the pathogenicity and biological characteristics of ALV-J strain.
