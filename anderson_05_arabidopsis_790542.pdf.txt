Abstract
Background: Flowering plant development is wholly reliant on growth from meristems, which
contain totipotent cells that give rise to all post-embryonic organs in the plant. Plants are uniquely
able to alter their development throughout their lifespan through the generation of new organs in
response to external signals. To identify genes that regulate meristem-based growth, we
considered homologues of Raptor proteins, which regulate cell growth in response to nutrients in
yeast and metazoans as part of a signaling complex with the target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase.
Results: We identified AtRaptor1A and AtRaptor1B, two loci predicted to encode Raptor proteins
in Arabidopsis. Disruption of AtRaptor1B yields plants with a wide range of developmental defects:
roots are thick and grow slowly, leaf initiation and bolting are delayed and the shoot inflorescence
shows reduced apical dominance. AtRaptor1A AtRaptor1B double mutants show normal embryonic
development but are unable to maintain post-embryonic meristem-driven growth. AtRaptor
transcripts accumulate in dividing and expanding cells and tissues.
Conclusion: The data implicate the TOR signaling pathway, a major regulator of cell growth in
yeast and metazoans, in the maintenance of growth from the shoot apical meristem in plants. These
results provide insights into the ways in which TOR/Raptor signaling has been adapted to regulate
plant growth and development, and indicate that in plants, as in other eukaryotes, there is some
Raptor-independent TOR activity.

Background
Plant development is remarkably plastic. Groups of
totipotent cells termed meristems, which are maintained
throughout the life of the plant, give rise to all postembryonic organs from roots and leaves to petals and
fruit. This allows plants, unlike metazoans, to change
their final body plans dramatically in response to environmental, hormonal and nutritional cues. While much has
been learned about the determination of cell fates in the
embryo [1] and the apical meristems [2-4], less is known

about the genes that control the growth that occurs in cells
emerging from the plant meristem.
TOR proteins were originally identified in budding yeast
as the targets of rapamycin, a potent antibiotic that disrupts cell growth [5,6]. In both yeast and metazoans, TOR
proteins mediate translation in response to nutrients [7].
Yeast TOR2 and mammalian mTOR also regulate
cytoskeletal organization [8-13].

In both yeast and mammalian cells, TOR proteins form a
complex, TORC1, with GβL [14] and Raptor (regulatory
associated protein of TOR) [15-17]; their yeast homologues are LST8 and KOG1, respectively [17]. Raptor contains protein-binding domains, and the Raptor Nterminus shows similarity to a caspase domain [18],
though catalytic activity has yet to be shown. It has been
reported that the strength of the TOR-Raptor interaction is
regulated by nutrients, though there is not yet consensus
on this point [15-17]. Raptor functions in TORC1 to
recruit substrates for phosphorylation by TOR; Raptor
binds TOR substrates S6kinase and eIF4E-BP, and is necessary for full TOR phosphorylation of these substrates in
vitro [16,19]. The TOR-Raptor complex is thought to
mediate the nutrient-sensitive regulation of cell growth;
mutants in yeast lacking a functional complex cease cell
growth in a manner that mimics rapamycin treatment
[17]. A second TOR complex, TORC2, involves GβL, Rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion to TOR) and perhaps other proteins [13,17,20]. This complex is
unaffected by rapamycin, and is thought to mediate TOR
cytoskeletal regulation.
In Arabidopsis the single TOR homologue, AtTOR, is critical for plant development [21,22]. AtTOR insertion
homozygote embryos undergo cell division but are unable to gain cell volume or undergo apical-basal differentiation. Although AtTOR transcripts accumulate in all
tissues assayed [22], an AtTOR-Gus fusion transcript is
only translated in meristematic tissue and the immediately adjacent expanding cells [21]. A TOR-specific microRNA conserved between Arabidopsis and rice [23]
implicates post-transcriptional regulation in AtTOR
expression. Rapamycin perturbs the activity of the nutrient-sensitive TOR complex in yeast and mammals. Arabidopsis, however, is insensitive to rapamycin, [21]
precluding this approach to the elucidation of Arabidopsis TOR signaling.
Here we report a characterization of AtRaptor1A and
AtRaptor1B, which encode the two Arabidopsis Raptor
homologues. We found defects in both root and shoot
growth in AtRaptor1B disruption lines, resulting in slow
leaf initiation, late flowering and increased branching. We
also found that AtRaptor1A AtRaptor1B double mutant
homozygotes undergo normal seedling development, but
exhibit only minimal post-embryonic meristem activity.
We contrast these results with those found previously for
the AtTOR mutant, and discuss the implications of this
work for TOR signaling in plants.

Results
Characterization of the Arabidopsis Raptor homologues
To search for plant homologues of mammalian Raptor,
we surveyed the completed Arabidopsis genome and found

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/3/12

two loci that might encode proteins highly similar to Raptor at the north ends of chromosomes 3 and 5. We did not
find an expressed sequence tag (EST) for the first locus
(AtRaptor1A; At5g01770). However, we used the 5'-rapid
amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) to establish that the
locus is transcribed to an mRNA with a 5' end consistent
with the predicted open reading frame (ORF) of
AtRaptor1A. The AtRaptor1A protein is predicted to be
1,346 amino acids in length. The second locus
(AtRaptor1B; At3g08850) was represented by a single EST
(accession no. AY769948). We used 5' RACE to confirm
that the EST contained the full ORF of AtRaptor1B. The
AtRaptor1B locus is transcribed to a 4.8 kb mRNA containing 23 exons, and the protein is predicted to be 1,344
amino acids in length. Predicted AtRaptor1A and
AtRaptor1B proteins show 80% identity over their
entirety.
To determine the time of divergence between the two
AtRaptor loci, we searched for Raptor homologues in available plant genome data using AtRaptor1A and AtRaptor1B
as query sequences. Full-length Raptor loci were discovered in the available rice (Oryza sativa subspecies japonica)
and alfalfa (Medicago truncatula) genome sequences.
Using AtRaptor1B and partial cDNA sequence (where
available) as guides, we determined putative protein
sequences from these loci. Alignment of these sequences
with AtRaptor1A, AtRaptor1B, mammalian Raptor, the
budding yeast Raptor homologue KOG1 and the fission
yeast Raptor homologue Mip1p showed that there is a
striking degree of conservation among all Raptor homologues (Fig. 1A; for the complete alignment [see additional file 1]). AtRaptor1B and the Saccharomyces cereviseae
Raptor homologue KOG1, the most divergent member
included in the analysis, show 28% identity throughout
their length. All plant Raptor homologues encode the
Raptor N-terminal Conserved / Caspase (RNC/C) motif,
HEAT repeats and WD40 motifs first identified in fission
yeast Mip1 and characteristic of all Raptor proteins
[25,26](Fig. 1B). From this alignment we generated a phylogeny of the Raptor homologues (Fig. 1C). The predicted
AtRaptor proteins resolve to a single clade with a high
degree of confidence, indicating that the duplication of
the AtRaptor loci post-dates the divergence of Arabidopsis
from Medicago, and that the loci are likely to encode functionally redundant proteins.
Identification of knockout mutants in AtRaptor1A and
AtRaptor1B
To gain insight into the function of the AtRaptor proteins,
we searched for insertion alleles of each locus among the
publicly available sequenced T-DNA insertion lines. Insertion mutant lines SALK_043920 and SALK_078159, with
disruptions to the AtRaptor1A and AtRaptor1B loci, were
obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center

(USA). Lines homozygous for each insertion (referred to
as 1A -/- and 1B -/-, respectively) were identified via
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and RNA from floral
buds of insertion homozygotes was used for reverse-transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) to assay for accumulation of
wild-type transcripts from the disrupted locus. AtRaptor1A
transcripts could not be detected in 1A -/- buds, but were
detected in 1B -/- buds. AtRaptor1B transcripts were not
detected in 1B -/- buds, but were detected in 1A -/- buds.
Both transcripts were detected in wild-type Columbia
(Col) buds (Fig. 2).
1B-/- seedling roots grow slowly
As a first step toward characterizing these mutant lines,
Col, 1A-/- and 1B-/- seedlings were germinated on culture

indistinguishable. However, B-/- seedlings showed distinct root growth defects: roots were thick, coiled and
densely covered with hairs, and the roots had difficulty
penetrating the medium (Fig. 3A). Plate-grown 1B -/seedlings were repeatedly shorter than Col or 1A-/- seedlings. Although dark grown 1B-/- seedlings were also
shorter than Col or 1A-/-, the difference in size was much
less (Fig. 3B). While dark-grown etiolated seedlings grow
primarily through the expansion and division of embryonic hypocotyl cells, light-grown seedlings grow primarily
through the production of cells from the root apical meristem. Thus the difference in size between Col, 1A-/- and
1B-/- seedlings results primarily from a reduction in root
apical meristem growth rather than a general defect in cell
expansion or metabolism.
The roots of 1B-/- seedlings grown on 90° inclined plates
were morphologically wild type but shorter than Col
roots. When the plates were rotated to lay flat horizontally, new growth from the root apex of 1B-/- seedlings
produced thick, coiled roots (though the roots were not
densely covered in hairs), while the previously produced
root tissue remained morphologically wild type (Fig. 3C).
Only those sections of the root not in contact with the
medium were hairy (Fig. 3A). Thus the root growth disturbance was a defect in growth into agar rather than in gravitropism, though in the absence of resistance, roots still
grew more slowly than wild type.

Col and 1B-/- root apical meristems (RAM) were examined using bright-field microscopy (Fig. 3I). 1B-/- seedling
RAMs contained all cell types present in Col RAMs but
their root morphology was much more blunt; this difference appeared to be localized to the 1B-/- zone of elongation. 1B-/- root tips showed a tendency to shed their root
caps, although shedding was sometimes observed in Col
root tips as well.

To measure developmental defects resulting from AtRaptor insertions, we grew Col, 1A-/- and 1B-/- lines on soil,
and scored their rates of leaf initiation, time to floral bud
initiation, rate of cauline leaf initiation, time to flowering
and number of floral shoot apices. 1B-/- plants were
smaller, had a slower rate of leaf initiation, and bolted
and flowered later than did Col or 1A-/- plants (Fig. 4A–

(H), (I) Col and B- root tips, viewed under bright field microscopy. Scale bar = 100 µm. B- root tips contain all the cell
types seen in Col root tips, but the overall morphology is

Mature 1B-/- plants were conspicuously bushier than Col
or 1A-/- homozygotes (Fig. 5). The primary shoot apex
was shorter than that of Col plants and ended prematurely
in a terminal inflorescence of infertile flowers. The growth
of the plant was then taken over by axillary shoots and by
secondary shoots from the basal rosette.
To quantify this phenotype, Col and 1B-/- lines were
grown to maturity in 16-hr days, and shoot architecture
for an individual plant was scored at the shattering of the
first silique. 1B-/- plants showed reduced shoot height,
reduced primary stem length, increased axillary branch
number and an increased number of secondary shoots
compared to Col and 1A-/- plants (Fig. 5B, E). 1B-/branch numbers, though variable, were significantly
larger than those of wild type or 1A-/-. Student's t-Tests of
sample pairs assuming equal variance yielded P-values of
0.0027 and 0.0004 for 1B-/- vs. Col and 1B-/- vs. 1A-/- axillary branch number, respectively, and 0.0026 and 0.0013
for 1B-/- vs. Col and 1B-/- vs. 1A-/- secondary shoot
number. Axillary branch length did not differ significantly
from Col values (Fig. 5F). This phenotype became more
pronounced later in plant development and was more
conspicuous under short days.
Complementation of the AtRaptor1B-/- phenotype
To confirm that the collection of phenotypes observed in
the AtRaptor1B-/- homozygotes was due to the mutant 1B
allele, 1B-/- plants were transformed with a construct containing the AtRaptor1B ORF and 5' UTR and driven by the
AtRaptor1B promoter. Some of these transformants
showed wild-type transition to bolting, shoot branching
and root growth (data not shown). We conclude that the
1B-/- phenotypes described above result from homozygosity for the lesion at the AtRaptor1B locus.

To obtain an estimate of the relative levels of AtRaptor1A
and AtRaptor1B in the signal seen in Fig. 6A, AtRaptor1A
and AtRaptor1B locus IDs were used to query the Genevestigator Arabidopsis thaliana Microarray Database and Analysis Toolbox [27]. AtRaptor1A and AtRaptor1B accumulate
in all developmental stages (Fig. 6C). However,
AtRaptor1B accumulation levels are consistently fourfold
higher than those of AtRaptor1A. A second analysis of
accumulation by tissue rather than developmental stage
produced similar results. We conclude that AtRaptor1A
and AtRaptor1B show similar expression patterns.
1A-/- 1B-/- double homozygote mutant seedlings show
minimal meristem growth
The high degree of similarity between AtRaptor1A and
AtRaptor1B led us to suspect that they may be at least partially functionally redundant. To eliminate all AtRaptor
activity in a single line, 1A-/- and 1B-/- lines were crossed.
No 1A-/- 1B-/- plants could be identified among the F2 of
this cross on soil. Phenotypically wild-type 1A-/- 1B+/plants were identified via PCR using the primer pairs
described in Materials and Methods and their progeny
(205 seedlings) were examined on agar plates. Of these,
165 seedlings (80%) appeared wild type (Fig. 7A). It was
determined by PCR that these seedlings carried a wildtype 1B allele (32/32 tested). The remaining seedlings
(40/205; 20%) germinated but showed minimal postembryonic shoot meristem growth (Fig. 7A). It was determined by PCR that these seedlings were genetically 1A-/1B-/- (32/32 tested). This genotyping confirmed that the
seedling arrest mutant phenotype co-segregated with
homozygosity for the AtRaptor1B mutant allele in the
AtRaptor1A mutant background. We concluded that this
seedling phenotype corresponded to the 1A-/- 1B-/- double mutant.

AtRaptor transcripts accumulate in dividing and
expanding cell tissues
A combination of in situ RNA hybridization and in silico
expression analysis was used to determine the RNA accumulation pattern of AtRaptor transcripts in Arabidopsis.
The AtRaptor1B cDNA sequence was used to generate an
AtRaptor probe to assay transcript accumulation in the
shoot tips of wild-type plants. Since AtRaptor1A and
AtRaptor1B show 80% identity through the length of their
transcripts, this probe likely detected expression of both
loci.AtRaptor transcripts were detected throughout the
shoot tip, in all organs of the differentiating floral bud,
and deep into the differentiated inflorescence stem (Fig.
6A). Signal intensity faded with the distance from the
shoot apex. This accumulation pattern differed from that
of actin (Fig. 6B), which was more prominent in dividing
cells of the apex. Notably, AtRaptor accumulation is not
restricted to the primary shoot apex.

visible under higher magnification. 1A-/- 1B-/- shoot
apexes showed minimal SAM activity: leaves 1 and 2 were
produced, but were smaller than wild type and did not
separate to reveal any further leaf primordia (Fig. 7F, G, H,

In order to determine whether a plant hormone or signaling molecule could restore post-embryonic growth to
these arrested seedlings, progeny of 1A-/- 1B+/- individuals were germinated on plates containing a variety of plant
hormones and signaling molecules and scored for their
total seedling lengths at 10 days post germination. Signaling molecules tested included the gibberellin GA3 (100
nM to 10 µM), abscisic acid (100 nM to 10 µM), the auxin
2,4-D (1 nM to 10 µM), the ethylene precursor ACC (1 µM
and 10 µM), sucrose (1%) and glucose (6%). We also
attempted dark treatment. None of these treatments
restored wild-type SAM growth to the quarter of the progeny showing seedling arrest. 1A-/- 1B-/- seedlings did
show a significant response to sucrose (Fig. 7B, C). Addition of 1% sucrose, which is a growth signaling factor as
well as a carbon source [28], to the growth medium promoted growth in Col, 1A-/-, 1B-/- and 1A-/- 1B-/-. In sibling seedlings, the addition of sucrose elicited a twofold
increase in seedling length; in the double mutants the
increase was five-fold. Germination on 6% sucrose, which
signals growth arrest in Col plants [28], yielded sibling
plants 1–1.5× the size of seedlings grown on 1/2
Murashige & Skoog (MS) salts with no sucrose added. 1A/- 1B-/- seedlings on 6% sucrose were 2.3× the length of
those grown on 1/2 MS salts. A similar result was observed
among 1A-/- 1B+/- progeny germinated in the dark on 1/
2 MS salts plates, and the length of 1A-/- 1B-/- seedlings
was increased more than 3× under these conditions. The
absolute length of the double mutant seedlings was in all
cases still substantially smaller that that of sibling seedlings for a given treatment, and the increase in length was
largely due to hypocotyl elongation or root growth. Minimal SAM activity was observed.

Discussion
Axillary branch growth in Arabidopsis and other vascular
plants is governed indirectly by auxin produced at the primary shoot apex, which acts through an undetermined
secondary messenger to repress axillary meristem growth
[29]. The shoot morphology of 1B-/- plants indicates a
defect in primary SAM maintenance. The primary shoot is
shorter than wild type and ends in a whorl of sterile flowers. The number and length of axillary shoots, both
cauline and emerging from the basal rosette, is significantly increased. Notably, axillary meristems are quite viable, producing branches as long as or longer than wild
type. The viability of axillary shoot apices points to a failure to maintain primary SAM activity, and a subsequent

failure to repress axillary meristem activity. This defect is
not shared by the axillary SAMs, which match or surpass
the activity of their wild-type counterparts. A similar phenomenon is seen in erecta mutants [30] and may be quite
common. The increased branching in AtRaptor1B mutant
plants may result directly from reduced auxin production
at the shoot apex or from a change in the auxin/cytokinin
ratio. However, 1B-/- mutants did not show defects in
their ability to sense exogenous auxin (data not shown).
The endogenous AtRaptor1A locus cannot fully complement the disruption of AtRaptor1B despite the fact that
their predicted proteins are 80% identical, share all conserved Raptor motifs and strongly resolve to a single clade
in phylogenetic analysis. In silico analysis suggests that the
failure of AtRaptor1A to mask AtRaptor1B lesions may be
due to lower levels of AtRaptor1A expression globally
rather than limited tissue-specific accumulation of
AtRaptor1A. We did not assay for the complementation of
AtRaptor1B lesions by transforming AtRaptor1B-/- plants
with an AtRaptor1A construct. In contrast, AtRaptor1B can
fully complement the loss of AtRaptor1A expression;
indeed, a single wild-type AtRaptor1B allele in 1A-/- 1B+/plants is sufficient for wild-type growth.
Our ability to isolate AtRaptor1B mutant homozygotes
conflicts with a recent report [24]. In that report, mutants
homozygous for AtRaptor1B disruptions were lethal at or
before the first asymmetric embryonic division, which is
even earlier than the lethality of AtTOR mutant homozygotes. We are uncertain of the reason for the discrepancy
in these results. We are able to recover 1B-/- plants, but
Deprost et al. [24], working with the same AtRaptor1B
allele (SALK_043920), described them as embryo-lethal.
One possible explanation might be a variation in growth
conditions, which could lead to a higher degree of stress
on developing embryos in the experiments by Deprost et
al. The fact that these authors observed some embryo
arrest in wild type control lines supports this possibility.
Disruption of AtRaptor1A yielded no significant phenotype in either our growth conditions or those of the previous report [24].
Simultaneous disruption of both AtRaptor loci resulted in
growth-arrested seedlings, which undergo normal
embryonic organogenesis but are unable to maintain
post-embryonic growth from their SAMs. AtRaptor1A-/AtRaptor1B-/- double mutants' SAMs cease activity after
the production of a few leaf primordia. We conclude that
AtRaptor activity is essential for the maintenance of SAM
activity, but not for SAM assembly or for the initiation of
SAM activity.
Our results indicate that AtRaptor activity is not essential
for embryonic organogenesis. In contrast, AtTOR-/-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/3/12

mutants arrest development early in embryogenesis [21].
The disparity between the AtRaptor1A-/- 1B-/- and the
AtTOR-/-phenotypes indicates that AtTOR activity in
embryonic development does not require AtRaptor. Thus
if AtTOR is acting in a complex in embryonic development, this complex does not require AtRaptor.
In both yeast and mammalian cells, TOR functions in two
distinct complexes (Fig. 8A). The first of these, TORC1,
involves Raptor and regulates cell growth and translation
in response to nutrients [14-17]. The second of these complexes, TORC2, regulates cytoskeletal organization and
does not involve Raptor [13,17,20].
AtRaptor-independent AtTOR activity in the plant embryo
is consistent with the existence of two AtTOR complexes
in Arabidopsis: 1) a Raptor-independent complex critical
for early embryogenesis (and perhaps all stages of plant
development), and 2) a Raptor-dependent complex that is
dispensable for embryonic development but which is necessary for post-embryonic, meristem-driven plant growth
(Fig. 8B).

Conclusion
By identifying the phenotypes resulting from partial and
total disruption of AtRaptor activity, we have generated
valuable tools for the study of plant TOR signaling. When
viewed in the context of previous work on AtTOR [21,22],
our work provides evidence for Raptor-independent TOR
activity in land plant embryonic development – development that, notably, occurs in an environment made nutritionally and environmentally stable via maternal input to
growth. We propose that in plants as in other eukaryotes
there are two (or more) TOR complexes, only one of
which involves Raptor. We further propose that the plant
homologue of TORC1, involving TOR and Raptor, has
been co-opted in plants from its ancestral role in nutrient
sensing and cell growth to regulate the highly plastic postembryonic growth driven by the plant shoot apical
meristem.

Methods
Insertion lines
The mutant lines SALK_043920 and SALK_078159, in
which Agrobacterium-mediated T-DNA insertions disrupted the AtRaptor1A and AtRaptor1B loci in the Columbia (Col) genetic background, were generated by Joseph
R. Ecker and the Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory (USA) and distributed by the Arabidopsis Biological
Resource Center (USA) [31]. Lines were genotyped using
the following primers: 1Asm5 5'aaaaagtctcttagatgtagtttcagatg 3' and 1Asm3 5' attcagaatatacaatccaagcattagt 3' to
identify the AtRaptor1A wild-type locus; 1Bsm5 5' ctgaccataacattctcttgtaggtaagg 3' and 1Bsm3 5' aggcctgaactctaatgaacaaactctcc 3' to identify the AtRaptor1B wild-type locus;

TOR functions in two complexes in eukaryotes
TOR functions in two complexes in eukaryotes. (A) TOR participates in two complexes in yeast and mammals. The first
of these, TORC1, regulates cell growth in response to nutrient and hormonal signals. Raptor is integral for TORC1 activity.
The second of these, TORC2, regulates cytoskeletal organization. Its activity is nutrient-independent, and Raptor is not a component of TORC2. (B) Model of TOR function in plants. Embryonic development is indicated by the single horizontal arrow
from zygote to seedling; meristem-driven post-embryonic development is indicated by the arrows emanating from the seedling
root and shoot apices. TOR, acting independent of Raptor in a putative complex homologous to yeast and mammalian TORC2,
is essential for embryonic development. TOR via TORC2 may play a role in post-embryonic development as well; the embryonic lethal AtTOR knockout phenotype precludes a definitive answer on this point. Raptor activity, in a putative plant homologue of TORC1, is dispensable for embryonic development but is essential for meristem-driven post-embryonic growth.

and 1Bsm5 or 1Asm5 and pROK-737 (5' gggaattcactggccgtcgttttacaa 3') to identify the respective AtRaptor
mutant alleles. Mutant lines were crossed to Col wild type
plants; the AtRaptor1B mutant phenotype cosegregated
with the 1B insertion allele in the F2 population.
Growth conditions
Plants were grown in a greenhouse with supplemental
light to 16 hrs, with temperatures held at 22°C days and
17°C nights. Seeds for plate-grown seedlings were surface
sterilized with 20% Chlorox, washed in H20, stratified for
four days at 4°C and grown on 1/2× MS salts, 0.3%
Phytagel under 12 hr. daylight cycles.
RT-PCR
Buds from Col and insertion line homozygotes were snapfrozen in liquid N2. Total RNA was extracted from 0.3 g of
tissue using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to
manufacturer's instructions. Resuspended RNA was thrice
treated with DNA-free™ DNase treatment (Ambion). RNA

was quantified with a spectrophotometer. cDNA was generated from 2 µg of total RNA using Omniscript Reverse
Transcriptase (Qiagen) and a poly-dT18 primer. PCR was
performed using ExTaq polymerase (Takara) in a PTC-100
thermocycler. Primer sequences were as follows:
1A+1828, 5' gctgcgtttattttggctgttattgtc 3' and 1A-2800, 5'
ctaggccagccagaggagtgtgagatg 3'; 1B+1379, 5' aggccggcaaaacgatcgtaagacatt 3' and 1B-2774, 5' catcagcccagaggagccaagagg 3'. PCR cycling parameters were 95°C for 5
min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 62°C for 30
sec, and 72°C for 1 min.
AtRaptor1B cDNA clone
EST clone RZL03b06 corresponding to the 5' end of
AtRaptor1B was ordered from Kazusa DNA Research Institute and sequenced (Accession number AY769948). RNA
ligase-mediated RACE was performed on total RNA
extracted from bulk shoot tissues using a GeneRacer™ Kit
(Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions in

Assembly of the AtRaptor1B complementation vector
Primers were designed to amplify the region from the end
of the transcript adjacent to the AtRaptor1B locus to a site
within the ORF, spanning a region from 1145 bases
upstream of the transcript initiation site through to the
sixth exon of the AtRaptor1B transcript. Primers used and
restriction sites added are as follows: 1B-8189BglII 5'
agatctgaggaaccagaagaaccc 3'; 1B+5104HindIII 5' aagcttcggcggagtaggaaaac 3'. PCR was performed using ExTaq
polymerase (Takara) in a PTC-100 thermocycler on Col-0
genomic DNA with the following parameters: 96°C for 5
min, then 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 60°C for 30 sec
and 72°C for 2 min, followed by a final step of 72°C for
10 minutes. HindIII BglII digested fragments of the resulting PCR products were ligated into pCambia1301.

Next, the 1301B construct was digested with PmlI and
PmeI. The EST containing the AtRaptor1B ORF was
digested with PmeI and SmaI, and the resulting fragment
was ligated into 1301B to create the complementation
vector 1301B:Raptor. 1301B:Raptor was transformed into
Agrobacterium line GV3101, and then into Col or 1B-/plants via floral dip [32].
Microscopy
SEM fixation was performed using standard methods
[33]. Bright field microscopy was performed on a Zeiss
microscope, and images were collected on a BioRad Confocal System.
In situ hybridization
Digoxigenin-labelled probes were hybridized to paraffinsectioned material using previously described methods
[34].

Alignment of Raptor homologues in plants, fungi and mammals Additional file 1 is an image of the Raptor homologue alignment. Shown are
predicted protein sequences for the plant Raptor proteins AtRaptor1A and
AtRaptor1B (Arabidopsis), MtRaptor (Medicago truncatula), OsRaptor
(Oryza sativa), the fungal raptor homologue Mip1 (S. pombe), and
mammalian Raptor. Sequences were aligned in Megalign; the image was
created in Genedoc. Putative sequences for AtRaptor1A and MtRaptor are
based on genomic predictions rather than EST or cDNA sequence. Residues that are 100% conserved (either identical or biochemically similar)
are shown as white text on black. More than 80% conservation is shown
as white on dark grey, and more than 60% is shown as black on light grey.
