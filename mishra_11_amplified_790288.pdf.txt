area, India

Abstract
Background: The region around Chandigarh in India has witnessed a resurgence of cholera. However, isolation of
V. cholerae O1 from the environment is infrequent. Therefore, to study whether environmental nonO1-nonO139
isolates, which are native to the aquatic ecosystem, act as precursors for pathogenic O1 strains, their virulence
potential and evolutionary relatedness was checked.
Methods: V. cholerae was isolated from clinical cases of cholera and from water and plankton samples collected
from freshwater bodies and cholera-affected areas. PCR analysis for the ctxA, ctxB, tcpA, toxT and toxR genes and
AFLP with six primer combinations was performed on 52 isolates (13 clinical, 34 environmental and 5 reference
strains).
Results: All clinical and 3 environmental isolates belonged to serogroup O1 and remaining 31 environmental V.
cholerae were nonO1-nonO139. Serogroup O1 isolates were ctxA, tcpA (ElTor), ctxB (Classical), toxR and toxT positive.
NonO1-nonO139 isolates possessed toxR, but lacked ctxA and ctxB; only one isolate was positive for toxT and tcpA.
Using AFLP, 2.08% of the V. cholerae genome was interrogated. Dendrogram analysis showed one large
heterogeneous clade (n = 41), with two compact and distinct subclades (1a and 1b), and six small mono-phyletic
groups. Although V. cholerae O1 isolates formed a distinct compact subclade, they were not clonal. A clinical O1
strain clustered with the nonO1-nonO139 isolates; one strain exhibited 70% similarity to the Classical control strain,
and all O1 strains possessed an ElTor variant-specific fragment identified with primer ECMT. Few nonO1-nonO139
isolates from widely separated geographical locations intermingled together. Three environmental O1 isolates
exhibited similar profiles to clinical O1 isolates.
Conclusion: In a unique study from freshwater environs of a cholera-endemic area in India over a narrow time
frame, environmental V. cholerae population was found to be highly heterogeneous, diverse and devoid of major
virulence genes. O1 and nonO1-nonO139 isolates showed distinct lineages. Clinical isolates were not clonal but
were closely related, indicating accumulation of genetic differences over a short time span. Though, environment
plays an important role in the spread of cholera, the possibility of an origin of pathogenic O1 strains from
environmental nonO1-nonO139 strains seems to be remote in our region.

Background
Cholera continues to be a serious epidemic disease in
various parts of Asia and Africa [1]. It is a severe form
of acute secretory diarrhoea caused by a gamma proteobacterium, Vibrio cholerae [2]. More than 200 serogroups (O1-O200) exist for V. cholerae on the basis of
epitopic variations in cell surface lipopolysaccharides,
but only serogroups O1 and O139 are pathogenic, and
are associated with cholera [3]. The pathogenic V. cholerae relies on the synergistic action of a set of virulence
genes for pathogenesis in humans. These include the
CTX element [4] and vibrio pathogenicity island (VPI)
[5], which encode cholera toxin (CT) and a colonization
factor, toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP) respectively. Other
important genes include toxR; this encodes a master
regulatory protein which, along with another factor
encoded by toxT, coregulates expression of both CT and
TCP [6]. V. cholerae is prone to extensive horizontal
gene acquisition of CTX and VPI elements [7]. Consequently, conversion of non-toxigenic strains into pathogenic strains is possible by horizontal acquisition of
virulence genes. It has been reported that the transduction process in the environment can result in conversion
of non-toxigenic environmental strains into toxigenic
strains [8].
The aquatic ecosystem has been incriminated for a
long time as a source and reservoir for V. cholerae [9].
There are several published reports regarding the distribution of virulence genes in environmental strains of V.
cholerae, which support the possibility of an environmental origin of pathogenic V. cholerae [10,11]. The
Northern region of India, which has freshwater environments and is far away from the sea, has witnessed a
resurgence of cholera in the recent past. In addition to
frequent sporadic cases, seasonal outbreaks have
occurred around Chandigarh in 2002 [12], 2004 [13],
2007 [14] and 2008 [15]. In the present study, the distribution of virulence genes and the molecular relatedness
of environmental isolates of V. cholerae to clinical isolates from patients with cholera from Chandigarh and
the surrounding region were investigated. Amplified
fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) was applied to
investigate the evolutionary relationships between environmental V. cholerae and clinical isolates in order to
understand the origin, epidemiology and spread of cholera in an endemic area with freshwater environs.
Methods
Collection and processing of samples

The present study was conducted around Chandigarh, a
region in North India (Latitude: 30°43’ N, Longitude: 76°
47’ E). Two groups of samples for the isolation of V.
cholerae were collected: environmental and clinical samples. The clinical V. cholerae were isolated from stool

samples of patients infected with cholera that were submitted to the Enteric Laboratory, Department of Medical Microbiology, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India. This is
an 1800-bed tertiary care referral institute in North
India that caters to a vast population in five states: Punjab, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh
and Uttrakhand. The environmental samples (water and
plankton) were collected from freshwater bodies and
cholera-affected areas around Chandigarh (Additional
files 1 and 2). Briefly, water samples were collected in
sterilized narrow mouthed bottles, and 1.0 L was filtered
through 0.22- μm pore-sized nitrocellulose acetate filter
membranes (Millipore, Bethesda, USA) which were
washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4).
Plankton samples were collected by filtering 20.0 L of
water through a plankton net (mesh size 25.0 μm) disinfected previously with 70% ethyl alcohol. The plankton
samples were washed with PBS and concentrated in
sterile plastic tubes. Aliquots (1.0 ml) of sample concentrate from water and plankton sampleswere added to
doubly concentrated alkaline peptone water (APW).
After incubation for 6 h at 37°C, a loopful of incubated
APW was streaked onto selective thiosulphate citrate
bile salt sucrose agar medium (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA)
and incubated for an additional 24-h period at 37°C.
Single colonies typical of V. cholerae i.e. yellow (sucrose
fermenting) and flat (2 to 3 mm in diameter) were
transferred to 10% sheep blood agar. The environmental
V. cholerae isolates were characterized extensively by a
battery of biochemical reactions including oxidase,
Hugh and Leifson O/F test, Moeller’s arginine dihydrolase, lysine and ornithine decarboxylases, arabinose,
mannose, sucrose peptone water sugars, the string test
and cholera red reaction [16]. After phenotypic characterization, the isolates were confirmed genotypically as
V. cholerae by species-specific PCR for the ompW gene
[17]. The isolates were further tested serologically with
commercially available V. cholerae O1 and O139 antiserum (Denka Seiken, Japan Ltd.).
PCR assays for virulence genes

The V. cholerae isolates were subjected to PCR assays,
described previously, for various virulence genes. The
targeted DNA sequences were: ctxA and tcpA [18], ctxB
[19], toxR and toxT [20]. The oligonucleotides were
synthesized by Invitrogen, India. The genomic DNA was
extracted using a protocol described previously [21].
The PCR reaction was carried out in a final volume of
25 μl containing: 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM
KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.001% gelatin, 100 μM of each
dNTP, 0.8 μM primer (20 pmol/reaction), 1U Taq DNA
polymerase and 25-100 ng of template DNA (all
reagents from Banglore Genei, India). The following
standard strains were used for the phenotypic and

genotypic tests: V. cholerae O1 ElTor N16961 (ElTor),
V. cholerae O1 Classical 569B (Classical), V. cholerae
O1 ElTor variant (ElTor variant), V. cholerae nonO1nonO139 NT5394 (NT5394); all were obtained from the
National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases
(NICED), Kolkata, India. In addition, V. cholerae O1
MTCC 3906 ElTor (MTCC 3906) was obtained from
the Microbial Type Culture Collection (MTCC) of the
Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India.
Amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis

Genotyping of V. cholerae was performed by AFLP as
described previously [22]. In brief, 125.0 ng of DNA was
double digested with EcoRI/MseI (1.25 U/μl) at 37°C for
2 h. The restriction endonucleases were then inactivated
at 70°C for 15 min and subsequent ligation of adapters
was performed at 20°C for 2 h. The sequences of primers and adapters used are listed in Additional file 3.
The restricted ligated mixture was diluted 1:5 and subjected to a preamplification reaction using non selective
primers (E-0, M-0; with no additional selective base) to
amplify all EcoRI-MseI fragments. Preamplification was
done with a PCR mix containing: 3.5 μl DNA, 1.5 μl
each EcoRI/MseI primer (30 ng), 0.1 μl 200 μM dNTPs,
0.33 μl Taq polymerase (5U/μl), 2.5 μl 10 × PCR buffer
containing 15 mM MgCl2, 1.0 μl MgCl2 (10 mM) and
14.67 μl H2O. The cycling profile used was: 20 cycles of
denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 56°C for 60 s
and extension at 72°C for 60 s. After preamplification
the reaction mixture was diluted 1:50 in TE buffer (pH
8.0) and subjected to selective amplification using selective primers G/G, C/T, C/G, G/T, T/A and G/A (E-N,
M-N; with +1additional base). The selective amplification was carried out using 1.0 μl template (25 ng/μl of
preamplicon), 1.5 μl each EcoRI/MseI primer (30.0 ng),
0.1 μl 200 μM dNTPs, 0.17 μl Taq polymerase (5 U/μl),
1.0 μl 10 × PCR buffer containing 15.0 mM MgCl2 and
4.73 μl H2O. The touchdown cycling profile for selective
amplification was as follows: cycle 1: 94°C for 30 s, 65°C
for 30 s, 72°C for 60 s; cycles 2 to 13: similar to cycle 1
except for a stepwise decrease in the annealing temperature in each cycle by 0.7°C; cycles 14 to 36: 94°C for 30
s, 56°C for 30 s, 72°C for 60 s. Following selective amplification, the reaction products were separated on 6%
denaturing polyacrylamide gels using SequiGen gel
apparatus 38 × 50 × 0.4 cm (BioRad Laboratories Inc.,
Hercules, CA, USA) and developed by silver staining
(Promega; WI, USA).
Evaluation of AFLP data

Bands from the AFLP gels were scored manually, as ‘1’
if present and ‘0’ when absent. The binary data were
evaluated according to the Jaccard coefficient of similarity and a phylogenetic tree (dendrogram) was

constructed using the unweighted pair group method
with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) [23] following sequential agglomerative hierarchical nested (SAHN) cluster
analysis using NTYsysPC version 2.003e (Applied Biostatics Inc.). The discriminatory power was calculated
using the Simpson’s coefficient of diversity (D) by using
the formula D = 1 - {Σ[nj(nj - 1)]}/[N(N - 1)], where N
is the number of strains tested, and nj denotes the number of strains belonging to the jth type [24]. Principal
coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed using DARwin 5.0 [25,26]. To investigate the variability within the
entire V. cholerae population further, principal components analysis (PCA) [27] was also performed using
informative fragments with the Software Package for
Statistics and Stimulation (SPSS 16.0), employing Varimax with Kaiser normalization (rotation method). The
chi-square and Fisher exact probability tests were used
to test the significance of the presence of fragments in
clinical isolates. The percentage of the genome interrogated using AFLP was calculated as described previously
by Lan and Reeves [28]. The average length of the
EcoRI-MseI AFLP fragment is 256 bp (equivalent to the
expected frequency of tetracutter MseI) and 9 nucleotides are associated with each EcoRI-MseI fragment (3
bases for the EcoRI site; 4 for the MseI site, and 2 for
+1 selection at each primer). Therefore, the genome studied for internal length variation is equivalent to the
number of fragments scored multiplied by 256 bp, and
point mutations scored are calculated by multiplying the
number of fragments by 9 bp.

Results
Characterization of V. cholerae isolates

Fifty-two V. cholerae isolates (13 clinical isolates, 34
environmental isolates and 5 reference strains) were
included in the present study. All clinical and three environmental isolates belonged to serogroup O1 and the
remaining 31 environmental V. cholerae were nonO1nonO139. The V. cholerae O1 were positive for ctxA,
tcpA (Eltor), ctxB (Classical), toxR and toxT. All nonO1nonO139 isolates were positive for toxR and negative for
ctxA and ctx B. All except one nonO1-nonO139 isolate
(E34/FS) were negative for tcpA (ElTor) and toxT.
Genotyping

A total of 318 fragments were scored, ranging in size
from 75 to 700 bp (Table 1). Two hundred and ninetynine fragments (94.3%) were polymorphic and nineteen
fragments (5.6%) were monomorphic. The primer combination G/T detected the largest number of polymorphic bands (68), while the primer pair G/G detected
the fewest (26) polymorphic fragments, with an average
of 50 polymorphic fragments per primer pair. Two hundred and eighty-two fragments were phylogenetically

informative (88.9%); out of these the majority (97.51%)
were found to be overlapping between the environmental and the clinical strains. No group-specific fragments,
exclusive to either environmental or clinical isolates,
were found. However, seven fragments were obtained
that were predominant in O1 strains as compared to
nonO1-nonO139 strains (p < 0.001). One fragment (240
bp) obtained with ECMT primer combination specific
for V. cholerae ElTor variant (Kolkata, NICED) was present in all O1 isolates but absent in other reference
strains. The discriminatory value (D) for each of the six
primer pairs used was greater than 0.98 (Table 1). Overall, using AFLP, 2.08% of the 4,034,664-bp V. cholerae
genome [29] was interrogated, including 81,408 nucleotides for EcoRI-MseI internal length variation (318 fragments × 256 bp) and nearly 2,862 for point mutations
(318 fragments × 9 bp).
Diversity and clonality of V. cholerae based on
genotyping

The AFLP analysis of the isolates demonstrated clearly
that the V. cholerae isolates in this cholera-endemic
region form a highly diverse population. By dendrogram
isolates examined were divided into one large heterogeneous clade (n = 41), with the two compact and distinct
subclades (1a and 1b), and six small mono-phyletic
groups with one to three members in each (Figure 1).
The distribution of isolates did not correlate with a particular time frame or geographical location. Sub-clade
1a (n = 22) consisted of nontoxigenic environmental V.
cholerae nonO1-nonO139 isolated from water and
plankton samples from different locations (mean similarity index 0.56). Only one pathogenic clinical O1
strain, C8 from 2007 (C8/07), belonged to sub-clade 1a.
Sub-clade 1b (n = 19) consisted of clinical isolates from

patients in North India collected between 2002 and
2009 and environmental toxigenic O1 strains: the O1
isolates collected at the time of an outbreak in 2008
(mean similarity index 0.63) and all the O1 reference
strains. Interestingly the ElTor and ElTor variant type
strains showed almost 94% pattern similarity. All O1
isolates exhibited 66% similarity with the Classical type
strain. In this cluster a conspicuous subgroup comprised
of a clinical isolate (C12) isolated in 2002 and the Classical type strain was observed (similarity index 0.70). In
addition to the above-mentioned subclades, six monophyletic groups - consisting of three singletons (E4/OS,
E23/OS, E32/OS), and three small groups consisting of
2 to 3 members were observed. All of them were separated from the main clade with a similarity index less
than 0.54. NT5394, a clinical nonO1-nonO139 isolated
in Kolkata, E34/FS (the only environmental nonO1nonO139 isolate that was tcpA+ and toxT+) and E9/FS,
isolated from two separate locations around Chandigarh
in 2007, clustered together. Overall, toxigenic V. cholerae O1 strains from the environment and clinical samples clustered together, while nonO1-nonO139 strains
diverged widely from the O1 isolates.
Using dendrogram analysis of the individual primer
combinations C/T, G/T and G/A, similar observations
were made (data not shown) i.e. all O1 isolates clustered together and nonO1-nonO139 were very heterogeneous. However, with the remaining primer
combinations, G/G, C/G and T/A, a larger number of
singletons was observed for both clinical and environmental isolates. Using principal co-ordinate analysis,
all the isolates were divided into two groups (pathogenic O1 and nonpathogenic nonO1-nonO139 isolates)
along the second coordinate axis, except for C8/07
which is an O1 isolate but was grouped with nonO1-

nonO139 (Figure 2). Overall, the distribution for
nonO1-nonO139 isolates was quite heterogeneous. The
principal component analysis (Figure 3), using informative fragments (282), reduced the 52 V. cholerae
into six components (18, 17, 8, 5, 2 and 2 isolates in
each component). In three-dimensional space, all V.
cholerae O1, including the reference strains, clustered
together in component II except C8/07. Environmental
nonO1-nonO139 isolates again constituted a heterogeneous population (components I, III, IV, V and VI),
further supporting the dendrogram analysis.

Discussion
This study was carried out in a cholera-endemic region
around Chandigarh that has freshwater environs. This
region has witnessed recently a resurgence of cholera,
with frequent outbreaks during summers and rainy seasons associated with contaminated water. However, isolation of V. cholerae O1 in the laboratory is infrequent.
Therefore, to study whether environmental nonO1-

nonO139 isolates, which are native to the aquatic ecosystem, act as precursors for pathogenic O1 strains,
their virulence potential and evolutionary relatedness
was checked. AFLP analysis was performed with six primer combinations on 52 V. cholerae isolates for realistic
exploration of genome composition, which facilitated
strain-to-strain discrimination. We investigated the relationships between clinical and environmental isolates on
the basis of random interrogation of nearly 2.08% of the
genome. The isolates, irrespective of their origin, were
divided mainly into a large single heterogeneous clade,
and six mono-phyletic groups. All the O1 isolates from
cholera patients and the environment harboured the
major virulence factors ctxA and tcpA and belonged to a
single sub-clade (1b). The environmental nonO1nonO139 isolates did not possess major virulence genes
and were heterogeneous in their distribution as shown
by the dendrogram, PCoA and PCA analyses. Overall
the resolving power for AFLP was found to be very high
(0.99), as documented previously [28].

Figure 2 Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plot for V. cholerae population based on AFLP fingerprinting pattern. The isolates are
represented as points in the ordination space. O1 isolates are depicted in red and nonO1-nonO139 in green and blue.

For the clinical isolates from different outbreaks, the
dendrogram did not show a distinct clonal population
(similarity index < 95%). Similarly, the V. cholerae O1
isolates formed a loose group in PCoA. This denotes
that continuous evolution is occurring in the V. cholerae
O1 population, which could be due to its ability for
extensive horizontal gene exchange. However, through
PCA, using only informative fragments and excluding
the singular fragments, there was evidence of clonal proliferation in the form of a tight cluster. Therefore, we
concluded that clinical isolates of V. cholerae obtained
in the same year were closely related. These strains may
give rise to outbreaks as a result of rapid expansion at
particular time intervals, and must be accumulating
genetic differences over time. Interestingly, fingerprint
patterns similar to those of clinical strains were

exhibited by three environmental O1 strains. These
were isolated during outbreaks from natural waters in
the cholera affected area, demonstrating that the aquatic
environment can serve as a reservoir for the transmission and spread of cholera, as already established by epidemiological studies of cholera [30].
This study revealed some interesting findings. One
clinical strain of V. cholerae O1 Ogawa ElTor (C12), isolated in 2002, clustered with the Classical type strain
(mean similarity index 0.70 as compared to 0.66 for
others). V. cholerae O1 Classical has not been isolated
from this region since 1975 (unpublished data). The
control ElTor variant from NICED Kolkata exhibited
approximately 94.0% similarity with Eltor N16961. In
addition, seven fragments were found to be predominant
in O1 strains as compared to nonO1-nonO139 strains.

Figure 3 Three dimensional representation of V. cholerae
population from cholera endemic area using Principal
component analysis (PCA) derived from informative fragments.
Black dots indicate O1 strains while blue dots indicate nonO1nonO139 strains. I, II, III, IV, V and VI represents 6 components into
which 52 isolates were divided. All V. cholerae O1 belonged to
component II except C8/07 belonging to component I and nonO1nonO139 isolates exhibited heterogeneous distribution.

Surprisingly, we found an ElTor variant-specific fragment that was absent from ElTor N16961, Classical and
MTCC 3906 type strains and was present in all O1 isolates. The presence of this specific fragment signifies
that ElTor variants are circulating in our environment.
Currently these variants are the predominant clone circulating worldwide [31]. We confirmed our findings by
detecting the presence of ctxB (Classical) by mismatch
amplification mutation assay (MAMA-PCR). A clinical
isolate of V. cholerae O1 (C8/07), isolated from the
2007 outbreak, clustered with nontoxigenic environmental isolates in sub-clade 1a that were isolated from different geographical locations(0.64 similarity index with
E33/OS and E6/OS). The significance of this finding is
not clear, but it may imply that some clinical isolates
have originated from environmental strains or from a
common ancestor.
The environmental nonO1-nonO139 isolates exhibited
very high divergence in their patterns. A strain isolated
from Ganges, and two strains isolated from Yamuna,
which are two major rivers in India, clustered with isolates from natural waters in widely separated geographical regions in Punjab and Haryana. In addition, two
strains isolated from natural waters in North India clustered with NT5394, a clinical nonO1-nonO139 strain

Page 7 of 9

isolated in NICED, Kolkata. Therefore, the presence of
some strains with related genomes in completely separate geographical locations suggests that V. cholerae is
highly successful in adapting to changing environmental
conditions, as reported previously [32]. Apart from the
above findings, V. cholerae isolated from different geographical locations and time periods intermingled in
sub-clade 1a. The O1 and nonO1-nonO139 isolates
were distinguishable clearly in the dendrogram, and in
PCoA and PCA analyses. Therefore, the pathogenic V.
cholerae O1 were genetically different and might have
evolved from distinct lineages.
The extensive variation in AFLP patterns in V. cholerae from a small geographical area leads us to conclude that this organism is very diverse and is evolving
continuously. Zo et al. in Bangladesh studied the spatial
and temporal relationship between clinical and environmental isolates from the same geographical areas by
enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)
PCR and found geographical seclusion to be a predominant factor in the creation of different lineages of V.
cholerae [33]. In our study, V. cholerae strains were studied over a much narrower time frame because almost
30 isolates were obtained in 2007. The large number of
DNA polymorphisms studied in this short time frame
revealed that the entire population of V. cholerae in this
region is highly heterogeneous and diverse, and that
strains from different geographic regions are intermingled, implying a weak spatial relation. This difference could also be due to the high discriminatory power
of AFLP versus ERIC-PCR. Similar to our study, extensive variation in a short time frame and small geographical location has been observed using variable number of
tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis in Bangladesh [34]. The
limited overlap between clinical and environmental isolates in the present study is in concordance with the
above-mentioned study. Similarly, the present study
does not support the concept of seasonal cholera outbreaks occurring by movement of a single clonal wave
across the region, because clinical isolates from the
same years were not clonal. V. cholerae O1 may cause
outbreaks by rapid expansion at particular time intervals, and must be accumulating genetic differences over
time. Comparative genome sequencing will provide the
most definitive answer to this question. In a recent
study by Chun et al. using genome based phylogeny, it
was concluded that V. cholerae O1 undergoes extensive
genetic recombination via lateral gene transfer driven by
environmental factors. The pandemic clones are drifting
as a result of variations in the composition of laterally
transferred genomic islands, which results in V. cholerae
O1 Eltor hybrid/variant clones [35]. Our study also supports the above hypothesis because the ElTor and ElTor
variant type strains showed 94% similarity. In the above

mentioned study, phylogenetic analysis revealed that the
strains belonging to nonO1-nonO139 serogroups from
various sources showed significant genomic diversity.
Therefore, taking into consideration the abundance of
vibrios (0.5 to 4% of aquatic bacteria) in the environment [36], and bearing in mind the extensive genetic
variation that these organisms undergo, the V. cholerae
in this cholera-endemic area were concluded to be evolving ad infinitum. The possibility of the origin of pathogenic strains from environmental strains seems to be
limited, because the O1 and nonO1-nonO139 isolates
were overall very diverse in our region.

Conclusions
This study is unique because it was carried out in a cholera-endemic region and over a narrow time frame. It is
the first such study from an area of India with a freshwater environment. In this study, we investigated the
relationship between clinical and environmental isolates
of V. cholerae on the basis of random interrogation of
2.08% of the genome by AFLP, a highly discriminatory
technique, using six primer combinations. The nonO1nonO139 strains were clearly distinguishable from pathogenic O1 stains because they did not possess any major
virulence genes on PCR analysis and exhibited different
AFLP patterns. The V. cholerae O1 population was not
clonal but was closely related. Our study does not support the concept of seasonal cholera outbreaks that occur
by movement of a single clonal wave across the region,
because the clinical isolates from the same years were
clearly different. This signifies that continuous evolution
is occurring in V. cholerae strains. V. cholerae O1 isolates
from patients with cholera and from the aquatic environment belonged to a single cluster, which demonstrated
the role of the aquatic ecosystem in the spread of cholera.
The nonO1-nonO139 strains were very heterogeneous in
their patterns and were different genetically from the O1
strains. The precise role of nonO1-nonO139 strains in
the dynamics of cholera outbreaks is unknown at present.
Our results suggest that they are highly diverse and may
be contributing to diversity in this cholera endemic area
by extensive genetic recombination via horizontal gene
transfer. The possibility of an origin of pathogenic O1
strains from nonO1-nonO139 environmental strains
does not seem to be likely in our region, because the
nonO1-nonO139 isolates were nonpathogenic overall
and diverse, and only one clinical isolate clustered with
the environmental nonO1-nonO139 V. cholerae strains.
