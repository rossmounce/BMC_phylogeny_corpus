Small variable segments constitute a major
type of diversity of bacterial genomes at the
species level

Abstract
Background: Analysis of large scale diversity in bacterial genomes has mainly focused on elements such as
pathogenicity islands, or more generally, genomic islands. These comprise numerous genes and confer important
phenotypes, which are present or absent depending on strains. We report that despite this widely accepted
notion, most diversity at the species level is composed of much smaller DNA segments, 20 to 500 bp in size,
which we call microdiversity.
Results: We performed a systematic analysis of the variable segments detected by multiple whole genome
alignments at the DNA level on three species for which the greatest number of genomes have been sequenced:
Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Among the numerous sites of variability, 62 to
73% were loci of microdiversity, many of which were located within genes. They contribute to phenotypic
variations, as 3 to 6% of all genes harbor microdiversity, and 1 to 9% of total genes are located downstream from
a microdiversity locus. Microdiversity loci are particularly abundant in genes encoding membrane proteins. In-depth
analysis of the E. coli alignments shows that most of the diversity does not correspond to known mobile or
repeated elements, and it is likely that they were generated by illegitimate recombination. An intriguing class of
microdiversity includes small blocks of highly diverged sequences, whose origin is discussed.
Conclusions: This analysis uncovers the importance of this small-sized genome diversity, which we expect to be
present in a wide range of bacteria, and possibly also in many eukaryotic genomes.

Background
The availability of bacterial genome sequences for closely related strains within a species and software dedicated to multiple genome alignments allow for a novel
perspective of bacterial genetic diversity [1-3]. Use of
these aligners has led to the notion that bacterial species
share a DNA backbone common to all strains interrupted by variable segments (VSs) that are specific to a
subset of the aligned strains [4-6]. The most studied
category of VSs are genomic islands, which are defined
by Vernikos and Parkhill as horizontally acquired mobile
elements of limited phylogenetic distribution [7]. These
islands are of a large size (30 to 100 kb), and often
encode genes critical for pathogenesis [8]. Their integration into genomes presumably occurs by site-specific

recombination. Genomic islands may then diffuse from
strain to strain by homologous recombination [9].
Where known, horizontal transfer of islands occurs
either by mobilization through bacteriophages, such as
in Staphylococcus aureus [10,11] or by conjugation,
using transfer origins located either outside or inside the
island [9,12,13]. Informatic tools have been developed to
detect such islands in genomes [14-16]. A second category of VSs of large size involves temperate bacteriophages, or phage remnants. Like genomic islands, they
enter the bacterial chromosome by site-specific recombination. Informatic tools to predict these elements have
flourished in the past few years [17-19]. Recently, a new
class of large variable elements has been characterized
with the clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), in which repeats alternate with
short DNA segments of plasmid or bacteriophage origin.
These regions confer phage or plasmid immunity [20,21]

by mechanisms that remain to be understood. Databases
for these elements are available [22,23]. Transposons
and insertion sequences (ISs) also contribute to VSs
when closely related genomes are compared, and their
size is small compared to the first two types of elements
(a few hundred base pairs to a few kilobases). These elements move within a given genome by transposition.
A reference website allowing their classification exists
[24], and two strategies for automated IS detection have
been described [25,26]. Finally, the smallest kind of VS
(with a = 20 bp threshold) expected to be present when
genomes are aligned are the minisatellites, composed of
small tandem repeats that are commonly used for strain
typing. Websites allowing their recognition are available
[27-29]. A special category of such repeats are the ‘small
dispersed repeats’, some 20 bp long and tandemly
repeated in various copy numbers in genomes, which
might be mobile [29]. The Escherichia coli genomes
contain a family of such elements, called palindromic
units (PUs; 30 to 37 bp), which are palindromic and
intergenic, and often combined in clusters [30].
DNA recombination and mutagenesis are the sources
of respectively large and small scale genetic diversity in
genomes. In a broad sense, recombination designates all
events that reshuffle DNA sequences. This reshuffling
can have two opposite effects: either it homogenizes
DNA sequences (a process called DNA conversion), or it
provokes the abrupt loss, acquisition or translocation of
genetic information, and therefore brings in diversity.
A wide range of artificial genetic systems have been set
up in the past decades to study recombination at the
molecular level in bacteria and to determine the frequencies of its occurrence. Among the three main categories
of recombination events, site-specific recombination is
highly efficient; for example, recombination can occur in
100% of cells in an engineered site-specific recombination assay [31]. However, this class of events is limited by
its specialization, as it requires a dedicated enzyme
(whose expression is usually regulated) and its cognate
site. The next most efficient bacterial system is homologous recombination; for example, an estimated 10-4 of a
non-stressed cell population recombined 1-kb-long tandem repeats present in the chromosomes of Salmonella
typhimurium [32], E. coli [33], Bacillus subtilis [34] and
Helicobacter pylori [35]. These events usually rely on
RecA, an ubiquitous enzyme that catalyzes homologous
DNA pairing. Homologous recombination is not
sequence-specific, and its efficiency is proportional to the
length of homology shared by the recombining
molecules. High proportions of recombinants are scored
during DNA conjugation (up to 10%), where several hundred-kilobase-long DNA segments enter the cell [36],
and during natural DNA transformation [37]. Finally, illegitimate recombination is the least efficient mode of

Page 2 of 15

recombination, with events occurring in approximately
10-8 of a given cell population [38,39]. It includes events
that join DNA segments not sufficiently homologous for
RecA pairing, nor involved in site-specific recombination.
Illegitimate recombination events are attributed to errors
of enzymes that deal with DNA, such as DNA polymerases [40-42], RNA polymerases [43], repair enzymes,
or topological enzymes (for reviews, see [44,45]). Interestingly, the non-homologous end joining type of illegitimate recombination, which involves dedicated enzymes
and has a pre-eminent role in eukaryotes, is almost
absent in prokaryotes, except in a few species such as
Mycobacterium tuberculosis [46,47] and B. subtilis, where
it contributes to spore germination and resistance to
desiccation [48,49].
To date, no correlation exists between experimental
DNA recombination studies and comparative genomic
analyses. Indeed, molecular analyses usually focus on a
single type of event (for examples, see [34,38,42]) without
considering its frequency compared to those of other
events that occur in the natural history of bacterial genomes. It is conceivable that the least efficient - that is,
illegitimate recombination - is the major contributor in
shaping bacterial genomes. Comparative genomic analyses offer the possibility to examine genome diversity
globally, but most studies usually concentrate on just a
single class of VSs. One exception involves a systematic
analysis of all VSs of more than 10 bp present on two
very closely related S. aureus genomes [50]. Among
27 VS sites, this study revealed a pre-eminence of illegitimate events over other classes of recombination, and
raises questions of whether this observation can be generalized to more diverse genomes, and to other species.
In this report, we performed multi-strain alignments
in three very different species to make a global assessment of bacterial diversity. Our aim was to understand
the kind of molecular events that shaped present day
genomes, and to determine the features of recombination. Our main finding is that short VSs (20 to 500 bp
long) are highly frequent in genomes and reside often
within genes. Such VSs are sometimes referred to as
indels, but our multigenome analysis shows that only a
minority of them originates effectively from an insertion
or a deletion; we therefore designated them collectively
by the broader term of ‘microdiversity’. This study
uncovers the numerical importance of microdiversity,
predicts the pre-eminence of illegitimate recombination
as the mechanism generating it, and highlights the existence, among microdiversity, of highly diverged blocks.

Strain choice

E. coli, S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were
selected to examine intra-species diversity at the

genome level, as they are the three species with the
greatest number of available genome sequences. Members of each species are known pathogens, but otherwise
they have very diverse characteristics: E. coli is a Gramnegative bacterium that lives both in the digestive tract
of warm blooded animals and in water, while S. aureus
and S. pyogenes are Gram-positive species that respectively colonize the nose, and skin and throat of mammals. Unlike the two other species, S. pyogenes is an
obligate fermenting bacterium. Five genomes representative of each of these species were selected such that
each member of the set was as distant as possible from
all others (see Materials and methods). The E. coli species is particularly diverse, and phylogenetic studies led
to the conclusion that a branch of this species, the B2
phylogenetic group, behaves as a subspecies [51,52].
Moreover, the comparative study of 20 E. coli genomes
identified a substantial set of genes that are unique to
the B2 group [53]. We therefore analyzed a set of five
E. coli B2 genomes as a group, in addition to the genome set representative of the E. coli species. Neighbor
joining trees derived from a new genomic distance
called MUMi (see Materials and methods) [54] were calculated for the four strain sets (Figure 1). The E. coli
MUMi tree was congruent with the phylogenetic tree
reconstructed from the Escherichia core genome genes
[53]. As for the S. aureus and S. pyogenes sets, reliable
phylogenetic trees derived from the concatenated core
genome of the species are not yet available to our
knowledge, but our previous results suggest that the
MUMi trees should be good approximations of phylogenetic trees [54].
To complete the five genomes analyses, alignments
involving a maximum number of genomes were also analyzed using 25, 11 and 12 genomes for E. coli, S. aureus

and S. pyogenes, respectively. Trees of the strains used
are shown in Additional file 1.
Alignments and definition of the variable segments

Complete multiple genome aligners provide general outlines of colinear regions among the genomes, as well as
the set of identical anchors (short DNA fragments)
shared by all genomes. Out of these data, complete
alignments can be defined precisely using a post-treatment step, so as to attribute which parts of the genomes
belong to the common backbone DNA, and which parts
are VSs (see Materials and methods). MOSAIC [55] is a
database offering such completely refined alignments for
bacterial genomes at the intra-species level, using either
MGA or MAUVE as entry points for the post-treatment
step. We have shown previously [4,5] that it is possible
to use robust criteria to delineate VSs: if in a part of the
alignment at least two DNA segments differ by more
than 24% at the nucleotide level, or if the alignment
includes a gap of at least 20 nucleotides, all segments of
this part of the alignment are labeled as VSs. Further
details on these parameter choices are given in the
Materials and methods and in Additional file 2.
VSs are defined here as DNA segments with a minimum length of 20 bp, and that differ from one another
at a given position of the alignment. The cutoff chosen
to decide that two VSs differ from one another is largely

above the average pairwise nucleotide diversity between
orthologous genes, which usually does not exceed 5% at
the intra-species level in bacteria. As a consequence, in
this analysis, all sequences having point mutations corresponding to the intra-species vertical divergence, as
well as small indels, are classified as the backbone and
are not considered.
The main characteristics of the alignments are presented in Table 1. While the E. coli strains were, as
expected, more distantly related to one another than
strains of the other sets [54] (see the longer branches in
Figure 1, and maximal MUMi values in Table 1), the
B2E. coli, S. pyogenes and S. aureus sets had similar ‘tree
depth’, suggesting that these three sets diverged during
similar evolutionary time scales.

in the four alignments (box plots). Each box shows the median
value (middle lane), first and third quartiles (lower and upper lanes)
of the size distribution. Values laying more than 1.5 times the interquartile value away from the bulk of all values are shown
individually as dots. The width of each box is proportional to the
number of VSs analyzed per alignment. On the right side, VSs
shorter than 500 bp are designated by microdiversity. Abcissa: E_co,
E. coli; E_B2, E. coli B2 phylogenetic group; S_au, S. aureus; S_pyo,

We will hereafter refer to ‘locus’ as the position of an
alignment where the backbone is interrupted by a VS in
at least one strain (Figure 2). The number of loci in a
given alignment varied from 344 to 1,037 depending on
the species studied (Table 1). The VS size distribution
in all four alignments is represented as a box-plot in
Figure 3, and whole distributions are shown in Additional file 3. A remarkable feature of all the alignments
was that most of the segments were small: the VSs had
a median size of 60 to 90 bp (Table 1), and at least 75%
of all VSs were smaller than 500 bp (Figure 3). Loci
where all VSs were less than 500 bp long were also
abundant (62 to 73% of all loci; Table 1), and will be
designated hereafter as microdiversity loci. To test
whether microdiversity was still present when more genomes are aligned, alignments of E. coli, S. aureus and S.
pyogenes using 25, 11 and 12 genomes, respectively,
were realized (Table 2). Overall, the number of loci
increased by 50% for E. coli, 26% for S. aureus, and 65%
for S. pyogenes. Again, microdiversity loci represented
55 to 78% of all loci. We conclude that the most abundant type of genomic diversity is microdiversity, irrespective of the number of genomes included in the
alignment.
Given the abundance of annotated data available for
E. coli in databases, we selected this species to perform
a mapping of the VSs to available annotations such as
bacteriophages, genomic islands, clustered, regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs), ISs,
and repeated elements such as minisatellites and PUs
(see Materials and methods for data collection). If more
than 50% of the length of a VS corresponded to an
annotated region, the VS was labeled as such. All VS
labels were then stored collectively at the locus level.
The number of loci containing each type of annotation
is reported (Table 3). Only 35% of the 1,037 loci of the
E. coli alignment, and 47% of the B2 subgroup loci, corresponded to one of the elements described above.
Therefore, the major proportion of the loci does not originate from readily identifiable events. In particular, the
microdiversity loci accounted for 63 to 72% of the category ‘Other’. The DNA content of the E. coli loci not
belonging to known categories was compared by Blast
to the Non-Redundant database (see Materials and
methods). The largest category comprised segments that
matched with other E. coli strains (65 to 86% of the
cumulated DNA length of all VSs tested in a given genome). This suggests that most of the VSs belong to a
shared pool of E. coli sequences, the so-called E. coli
pan-genome. The next largest category included segments that did not have any match in the database (13
to 34%). DNA segments matching to other species or

environmental samples were essentially absent. In conclusion, most of the variable loci are microdiversity loci,
and to the best of our knowledge for E. coli, they do not
correspond to known elements, although most contain
pan-genomic DNA.
Identification of the microdiversity regions possibly
affecting genes

The remaining part of this analysis focuses on the
microdiversity loci that correspond to largely unknown
aspects of genome diversity. We chose to focus on the
five-genome alignments because more information was
available for these. We asked how microdiversity regions
were located respective to genes. A microdiversity locus
was designated as an ‘intragenic locus’ if all VSs of the
locus were located inside a gene, without perturbing its
reading frame, and as an ‘intergenic locus’ if all VS
boundaries were located outside genes (Figure 2a, first
two examples). We also considered the cases where
insertion of a VS interrupts a gene in at least one strain
of the alignment (such as with IS insertions), and called
this category ‘flanking gene missing’ (Figure 2a, third
case). Addition of DNA can also sometimes provoke an
in-frame fusion, resulting in a locus where VSs have
‘flanking genes of variable length’. Finally, we placed the

remaining loci in the ‘mixed locus’ category (it can correspond, for instance, to loci where some VSs of a given
locus are intragenic and others intergenic).
Thirty-five to 55% of the microdiversity loci were
intragenic (Figure 4), and did not perturb the reading
frame of the gene (for example, see the nucleotide
sequence of a 61-bp microdiversity locus present in
the manZ gene; Figure 5). The number of genes
affected by microdiversity, that is, harboring a VS in at
least one genome, was then calculated. Depending on
the genome and the alignment, their proportion ranged
from 3 to 6% of all genes. Some genes contained more
than one VS. Remarkably, some S. aureus genes harbor
up to seven in-frame VSs. These S. aureus VS-rich
genes encode surface proteins such as the fibrinogen
binding protein SdrE, or clumping factor ClfB. The
most VS-rich gene of E. coli and B2 subgroup alignments is ftsK (four and three VSs, respectively), encoding a membrane protein important for chromosome
segregation. In most cases (75 to 92% of intragenic
loci), the amino acid sequence of the protein was modified by the presence of the VS. Complete lists of these
genes are given in Additional files 4, 5, 6 and 7, with a
break-down according to functional categories for
E. coli genes in Additional file 8. Genes encoding

membrane proteins were significantly enriched among
the population of genes with microdiversity loci in the
E. coli and B2 lists (Additional file 8). These results
suggest that besides point mutations, genes also evolve
by more abrupt, ‘block modifications’ of gene fragments (see Discussion).
Intergenic loci represented 23 to 48% of all loci (Figure 4). In E. coli, some of them corresponded to PU/
repetitive elements (93 of 276 for the global E. coli
alignment, and 32 of 127 for the E. coli B2 subgroup
alignment). In the S. aureus alignment, the intergenic
loci were the most abundant, representing 48% of all
variable loci. Some of them likely correspond to Staphylococcus repetitive elements [56] that are intergenic, or
to staphylococcal interspersed repeats units [57]. An
analysis was performed on loci where VSs were located
less than 500 bp upstream of an ORF (Additional files 9,
10, 11, and 12), and a break-down in functional categories was effected for the E. coli genes (Additional file
13). The proportion of genes preceded by a VS ranged
from 1 to 9% of all genes. Non-coding RNA (corresponding to tRNA, rRNA and small non-coding RNA)
were significantly enriched among the genes preceded
by a VS (Additional file 13). Note that these RNA were

not target sites for genomic island integration, which
preferentially integrate downstream from tRNAs. They
often corresponded to variations in runs of tRNA genes,
or in tRNA interspersed between rRNA genes. Apart
from this special category, we suspect that the presence
of VSs upstream of genes may affect regulation, and
hence contribute to strain diversity.
The mixed loci (5 to 10% of all loci) correspond generally to cases where the VSs are either intragenic or
intergenic. This suggests mutagenic insertion of a
DNA sequence inside a gene, leading to its pseudogenization in the strains where the locus is intergenic.
Some additional cases of pseudogenization may be
detected in loci with a flanking gene missing (5 to 7%
of all loci; Figure 4), if the gene loss is due to the
introduction of the VS.
Some 10% of the VSs are flanked by direct repeats in the
microdiversity loci

Recombination between directly oriented repeats placed
at the base of the VS may explain one mechanism of
variability: in some strains, a deletion may have occurred
between repeats, thereby generating a new locus in the
alignment. The percentage of VSs flanked by repeats
varied between 10 and 18%, with the highest frequency
occurrence in S. aureus (Table 4, first part). The vast
majority (66 to 94%) of repeat sequences were less than
30 bp in size.
If repeats are responsible for instability, one would
expect to find genomes in which the VS is deleted. Loci
at which at least one of the VSs was flanked by repeats
were designated ‘r-loci’ (Table 4, second part). Among
these r-loci, the proportion of those where at least one
genome had an empty VS at the locus (empty VS means
the VS is absent or less than 20 bp long) could be calculated (Table 4, last lines). For the E. coli and S. pyogenes
alignments, this proportion was 42 to 66%, which is significantly higher than expected (P << 0.01). For S. aureus, the proportion of r-loci with apparent deletions was
only 16%, which is even less than the overall proportion
of loci with apparent deletions (22%). We conclude that
for the r-loci, variability may be explained in part by
recombination between these repeats; these events
appear to be more frequent in E. coli and S. pyogenes
than in S. aureus. Overall, up to one-fifth of the microdiversity between genomes may be due to recombination between short repeats flanking some of the VSs.
Global prediction of loci history reveals two important
categories of events: dimorphic loci, and highly divergent
loci

A global analysis was carried out to investigate the possible history of loci and assess the contribution of deletions, insertions, and more complex situations. This

VS analysis

Loci analysis

implied the analysis of VS content, placed within a phylogenetic context. Our approach consisted first in
assigning an ‘occupancy’ value to all loci. It corresponds,
for a given locus, to the number of genomes that
‘occupy’ the locus, that is, where the VS is not empty.
We observed that 75 to 80% of loci had maximal occupancy, that is, occupancy 5 (Additional file 14).
We then made use of locus occupancy, strain phylogeny and VS content to predict some simple situations,
using the parsimony principle (Figure 2b): loci of occupancy 1 with VSs on a short branch were predicted to
be ‘recent insertions’, while loci of occupancy 4 with
identical VS content and the longer branch occupied
were predicted as ‘recent deletions’. Using a similar
method, loci of occupancy 2 or 3 with VSs of identical
content present on the same sub-tree, were predicted as
‘ancestral insertions or ancestral deletions’. Among the
loci of maximal occupancy, two situations were singled

loci present in each alignment.

out: loci with only two kinds of VS segregating on subtrees, which were named ‘dimorphs’; and loci where all
VSs turned out to be of nearly identical content, which
were named ‘homeologs’. These loci may indicate places
where DNA diverges more rapidly than elsewhere on
the genome, and they were therefore kept in the ‘VS
pool’. The last category of ‘polymorphs’ included all
other loci.
Results showing the proportions of loci encountered in
each category are reported in Figure 6. Surprisingly, the
‘dimorphs’, in which a given locus contains exactly two
different kinds of segment, was the most abundant category. Dimorphic loci can be explained by the presence of
a DNA insertion hot spot or by the replacement of an
‘ancestral’ sequence by a new segment. If such is the case,
it should be possible to match one of the two VSs of the
locus with a genome segment of a closely related species.
A Blast analysis was conducted for the E. coli and B2
phylogenetic group alignments on all dimorphic loci,
using Escherichia fergusonii as an out-group [53]. In 55%
of E. coli loci, and 36% of the B2 group loci, a matching
segment with E. fergusonii was found (76% identity on
90% of its length). This argues for the existence of a segment replacement in a fraction of the dimorphs. A comparable matching could not be performed for the two
other species due to the absence of a sufficiently proximal genome out-group.
Homeologous loci represented 9 to 30% of the total
loci (see Figure 5 for an example of such an homeologous locus). Interestingly, the longer the maximal
MUMi genomic distance among the strains being compared, the higher the proportion of divergent loci
among the total VSs. This may suggest that the yield of
divergent loci reflects the evolutionary time elapsed
from the time that the species diverged. The homeologous loci were significantly enriched among the intragenic loci for two alignments: E. coli (53% of intragenic
loci are homeologous, compared to 30% homeologous
loci overall, P << 0.01), and S. aureus (33% compared to
23%, P = 0.017). This was not the case, however, for the
B2 E. coli alignment (14% compared to 9%, P = 0.08), or
the S. pyogenes alignment, where 23% of intragenic loci
are homeologous, compared to 20% overall.
The polymorphic loci included 4 to 31% of all microdiversity loci, and may correspond to recombination
hotspots, which remain to be studied in detail.
We then proceeded to test whether the two most
important categories identified with the five-genome
alignments, namely dimorphic and homeologous loci,
were conserved when more genomes were included in
the alignment. This proved to be the case (Table 2). For
the E. coli and the S. pyogenes alignments, the homeologous loci even became preponderant relative to the
dimorphic loci.

In conclusion, microdiversity loci correspond mostly
to cases of segment replacement, recombination hot
spots, or to homeologous DNA that diverged faster relative to the backbone DNA. Cases of simple deletion or
insertions were scarce, proportionally.

Discussion
Microdiversity constitutes a major type of variability
between bacterial genomes within a species

The main outcome of this study is the discovery of a
major type of bacterial genome diversity at the species
level, made of variable short segments between 20 and
500 bp long. In the five-genome alignments, these VSs
represent some 63 to 72% of all possible variable regions
detected by whole genome alignments. They remain
very abundant (50 to 72% of all loci) when a maximal
number of genomes are included in the alignments
(Table 2). The presence of such small diversity had been
reported earlier for E. coli [4,58], and its general importance is presently emerging in various comparative
genomic studies, both in eukaryotes [59] and prokaryotes [60], where it is often reported as indels. However,
the term indel is imprecise with respect to the size of
segments involved (it can be used for 1- to 10-bp insertions or deletions up to the insertion or deletion of
genomic islands). It is also misleading in terms of the
underlying mechanism because it suggests that an insertion or a deletion occurred. Our work shows that more
than 80% of the microdiversity loci are due to neither
insertion nor deletion. The term indel was therefore
replaced in this study by the more neutral term of
microdiversity. If such microdiversity were found essentially outside genes, it might be considered as recombination scars, with little evolutionary importance.
However, among the five-genome alignments, 35 to 55%
of microdiversity regions lie within ORFs and 16 to 33%
of VSs are immediately upstream of ORFs. They should
therefore contribute greatly to strain diversity within a
species, either by affecting protein domains or by changing gene expression.
Among the E. coli genes harboring microdiversity,
those encoding membrane and surface proteins are significantly enriched in VSs. This is in keeping with the
notion that bacteria adapt to their varying and challenging environments by modifying their surface proteins,
as already documented [61]. A comparative genome
analysis detected 23 genes that are under positive
selection in E. coli [62]. The present study identifies
six of them (fhuA, ompA, ompC, ompF, lamB and
ubiF) as harboring microdiversity. Moreover, for five of
the six proteins where the structure is known, the
Peterson analysis revealed that all mutations were concentrated on one or a few loops of the protein [62];
this feature allowed us to detect them in our screen, as

Page 8 of 15

scattered mutations would have gone undetected.
Recently, using a more sensitive approach, 290 core
genes of E. coli were detected as under short-term
positive selection [63]. However, only four of them
(narH, fes, cstA and yphH) corresponded to the 192
genes we report here as harboring microdiversity.
Therefore, at least 10 of the 192 genes harboring
microdiversity may be under positive selection. Interestingly, microdiversity regions have been found in
orthologous proteins compared broadly across bacterial
and yeast species and found to be more numerous in
essential proteins, which suggests a functional role for
these flexible regions [60].
Illegitimate recombination may explain a large fraction of
the VSs

One aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms
underlying DNA recombination in microbial genomes.
To this end, we focused on E. coli, the best studied bacterial species at the molecular level for recombination.
More than half of the VS loci could not be explained by
site-specific recombination, nor by transposition, nor by
the hypothetical mechanism invoked for very short dispersed elements similar to PUs [29] (Table 2). We speculate that homologous or illegitimate recombination
may explain these loci: in the three species, analysis of
the five-genome alignments have shown that 10 to 18%
of the VSs are flanked by repeats at least 5 bp long,
which might account for part of the variability, especially as a deletion was often found associated with such
loci (Table 4). However, as most repeats were of a size
below 30 bp, the reported threshold for RecA-dependent
homologous recombination in E. coli [64], it is likely
that VSs are generated by replication slippage between
the repeats, a mechanism also called short-homologydependent illegitimate recombination [65]. Although not
as proportionally abundant as events detected in a previous, more limited study [50], the present analysis
implicates short-homology-mediated deletion events as
one significant cause of genome variability.
This conclusion on the importance of illegitimate
recombination with regards to the VSs should not yield
to the notion that homologous recombination is unimportant in bacterial genomes. Rather, homologous
recombination relies on the detection of subtle tracts of
3 to 4% diverged sequences, which are not taken into
account in our VS analysis. These sequences are part of
the backbone, and studies on backbone DNA detecting
blocks of mutations moving together across strains have
shown, to the contrary, that homologous recombination
plays a great role in bacteria. In E. coli, the average size
of these blocks was estimated to be 500 bp in a first
study on four genomes [66], and more recently re-estimated to to 50 bp based on a 20-genome comparison

Touzain et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R45
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/4/R45

[53]. It has also been demonstrated that genomic
islands, once integrated into a genome (by site-specific
recombination most likely), diffuse in a population by
homologous recombination between the sequences
flanking the island [9].
Dimorphic loci, which contain exactly two different
segments at a given site, represent 38 to 68% of all loci
in the five-genome alignments (Figure 6), and 22 to 52%
of all microdiversity loci in the maximal alignments
(Table 2). In the case of the E. coli five-genome alignment, we found that in about half the cases, one of the
two segments was present in E. fergusonii. This suggests
that the ancestral segment was replaced at some point
by another segment. A process called ‘illegitimate
recombination assisted by homology’ can produce such
a situation [67-69]. If the new incoming DNA segment
is flanked by a segment homologous to the recipient
chromosome, RecA may initiate homologous recombination on part of the molecule, followed by ‘illegitimate’

Page 9 of 15

actors that complete the DNA integration at the other
extremity (Figure 7a). Such a process is described in
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baylii and
Pseudomonas stutzeri, three naturally competent species,
and was found to be 102- to 105-fold more efficient than
strict illegitimate recombination [67-69]. Whether such
a process could occur in E. coli, for instance during
DNA conjugation, is presently under study. Alternatively, dimorphic (as well as polymorphic) loci may also
correspond to fragile sites of the chromosome, which
are hot spots of illegitimate recombination.
Although illegitimate recombination occurs at low frequency, our analysis of VSs suggests that it nevertheless
is responsible for a large proportion of the genomic
diversity: taking all loci differing from known events for
E. coli, and labeled “Other” in Table 3, and removing the
category of homeologous loci (Figure 6) we estimate that
it is responsible for 41% (E. coli five-genome alignment)
to 56% (E. coli B2 alignment) of microdiversity loci.

What mechanism generates homeologous DNA
microdiversity?

A particular class of loci comprises those containing
homeologous sequences. For E. coli, S. aureus and
S. pyogenes, they represent 20 to 30% of loci in the fivegenome alignments, and even more (20 to 46%) in the
maximal genome alignments (Table 2). They are less
abundant, however, in the alignment of B2 genomes
(9%). Interestingly, we found that among the five-genome alignments, homeologous loci were significantly
enriched among intragenic loci (50 to 78% of the divergent loci are intragenic). The question arises as to how
such blocks of microdiversity could be generated. Three
scenarios are considered: positive selection, homeologous recombination and mutation showers (Figure 7b).
Positive selection

A given protein domain may be under positive selection,
so that non-synonymous mutations accumulate in a limited region of the corresponding gene, while conservation of the rest of the protein is selected by physical
constraints (for example, membrane-spanning domains),
such that non-synonymous mutations are counterselected. In contrast, synonymous mutations are
expected in equal density inside and outside the microdiversity block. However, we did not observe this pattern (synonymous mutations were also enriched in the
homeologous loci), and therefore tend to exclude this
hypothesis.
Homeologous recombination between diverged DNA
segments

Given our similarity threshold, recombination should
have taken place between at least 24% diverged
sequences. In E. coli, RecA seems inefficient on 22%
diverged sequences [70], and B. subtilis RecA is apparently inhibited by 7% divergence [71]. However, phage
recombinases may be more efficient on highly diverged
DNA [70]. Moreover, it is suspected that, in nature, bacteria alternate between a mutator and non-mutator
state, via the inactivation/activation of the mutS or
mutL genes, and during the mutator period, homeologous recombination should increase [72].
Mutation showers

High mutation densities are sometimes observed both in
eukaryotes [73]and prokaryotes [74], and it is suggested
that local exposure to a mutagenic agent, or a long state
as single strand DNA may result in such mutation
showers [75].

Conclusions
We report here an attempt to examine systematically
genome variability at the DNA level in several bacterial
species. We have shown that at the species level, the
main kind of genomic variability is ‘microdiversity’. It
consists of small blocks (20 to 500 bp in length) of

Page 10 of 15

DNA, often present within or upstream of genes and
contributing to the genome diversity. This notion raises
the question of the mechanisms that may generate such
diversity, and opens challenging new questions at both
the molecular and bacterial evolution level.

Alignment strategies

A first set of alignments involving few and collinear genomes were computed using the MGA software [2]. Genomes were selected so as to be representative of the
species under study. For this, a genomic distance based
on maximal unique matches (MUM) was calculated for
all possible genome pairs [54], and neighbor-joining
trees were built so as to choose the appropriate

Touzain et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R45
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/4/R45

genomes. When several closely related genomes were
available, the second criterion used was genome collinearity, as determined by Mummer plots [79]. MGA
alignment parameters were fine-tuned as described [4].
Briefly, in a first step, detection of anchors composed of
maximal exact matches of minimal length 50 bp common to all genomes was carried out. A subset of collinear anchors was then selected by a chaining algorithm.
Next, these two steps were repeated in each interval
framed by the chosen anchors, using a lower minimal
length value of 20 bp for the maximal exact matches.
The remaining gaps of the alignment, if shorter in
length than 3,000 bp, were treated with ClustalW.
MGA alignment outputs are stored in the MOSAIC
database after a post-treatment step on the raw ClustalW results. This step is needed to define, among the
ClustalW output files, those in which the alignment
reflects common ancestry from those where different
pieces of DNA are forced into an alignment. As
described earlier [4], post-treatment parameters were
chosen so as to classify as VSs all segments of a given
locus, if at least two of them share less than 76% identity on 100% of the aligned length, or if a gap larger
than 20 bp is found in the alignment. This allowed a
high sensitivity with respect to VS size, but also some
flexibility with respect to overall DNA divergence. The
choice of the 76% threshold for DNA identity is
described in Additional file 2. The 20-bp gap size was
chosen as corresponding, at the protein level, to a small
secondary structure of at least six amino acids. The
minimal VS size was set to 20 bp. We compared the
results obtained when the minimal VS size was
increased from 20 to 42 bp for a three-strain E. coli and
a six-strain S. aureus alignment (alignments computed
in the preparatory phase of this analysis). This resulted
in a 26% decrease in the global number of loci. This
indicated that an important proportion of VSs belongs
to microdiversity loci, and justified our choice to maintain the minimal VS size as 20 bp, so as to be more sensitive to the microdiversity loci that may contribute to
strain diversity.
A second set of alignments were computed so as to
include a maximal number of genomes for the E. coli,
S. aureus, and S. pyogenes species, using MAUVE version 1.2.3 for S. aureus and S. pyogenes [1], and progressive MAUVE version 2.1.3 for E. coli, instead of
MGA for the first step. The same MOSAIC post-treatment step as described above was then applied [5].
Compared to MGA, the MAUVE software offers the
advantages of dealing with large rearrangements, and
the possibility to treat high numbers of genomes. This
comes, however, at the price of slightly less precise
backbone/VS boundaries, as we observed when comparing output from MGA versus MAUVE version 1.2.3

for an E. coli MG1655-Sakai alignment. Analyses
requiring precise VS boundaries, such as repeat detection and positions of VSs relative to genes, were thus
restricted to the MGA alignments. The phylogenetic
trees corresponding to the strains used for the alignments are shown in Additional file 1.
Collection of additional annotations for the E. coli
genomes
Bacteriophages

Phage coordinates of strains MG1655 and Sakai were
downloaded from the Sakai genome project web page
[80]. For the CFT073, UTI89 and 536 genomes, the Prophinder tool [19] and web access were used [81].
CRISPR sequences

Positions of the CRISPR sequences were retrieved from
the CRISPR database of G Vergnaud’s laboratory [82].
Genomic islands

Ou et al. [16] described a systematic means to detect
genomic islands. Coordinates were downloaded from
the supplementary data provided by them for MG1655,
Sakai and CFT073 genomes. For the other genomes, an
approach similar to that of Ou et al. based on synteny
break points was used. Briefly, blocks of genes at least 5
kb long and not following the local synteny are analyzed
for exceptional GC content or interpolated variable
order motif (IVOM) value [83], presence of flanking
tRNA genes, and presence of integrase-like genes. All
blocks meeting at least one of the criteria were considered as regions of genomic plasticity, a denomination
that does not make any assumption about the evolutionary origin or genetic basis of these variable chromosomal segments. The regions corresponding to
bacteriophages and CRISPRs as defined above were then
removed, and counted separately.
Insertion sequences

For all genomes but S88, UMN026 and IAI1, IS coordinates were taken from the ASAP site [84]. For the three
remaining genomes, ISs were detected by the presence
of transposase genes.
Palindromic units/repetitive sequence elements

PUs, also called repetitive sequences, have been
described for E. coli [30]. Their coordinates on MG1655
were calculated starting from the Bachelier web page
[85], and converting the coordinates so that they match
with the current version of the MG1655 genome. Detection of putative PUs on the other E. coli genomes was
performed as follows. PUs being palindromic, the presence of half a PU was searched using fuzznuc
(EMBOSS package), with the following pattern ‘ [ACG]
[AT] [TC]GCC [GT]GATGCGN(3,9)CG [CT](0,1)
CTTATC [CA] GGCCTAC [AG]’ allowing for a
maximum of four mismatches. PUs are often associated
in pairs, which form bacterial interspersed mosaic

Genomes were searched for tandemly repeated
sequences on the minisatellite database of G Vergnaud’s
laboratory [86]. Parameters used were repeat motifs at
least 20 bp long, repeated at least twice, such that identity between repeats is at least 90%. Among the minisatellites, a majority corresponded to PU elements that
were scored separately (see above), so that only the
remaining, non-PU minisatellites were reported in this
category.

labeled intragenic. If all VSs were between two genes
that did not overlap with the VS boundaries, the locus
was labeled intergenic. A flanking gene on the backbone
was considered as missing if, among all VSs of the
locus, the distance between one VS boundary and its
neighboring gene distal extremity varied by more than
500 bp (that is, the approximate size of a small gene).
When the flanking gene overlapped with a VS boundary,
the gene portion lying inside the VS was compared with
all VSs: if this portion varied by more than 50 bp
(approximately 16 amino acids), it was considered that
the locus modified the length of the flanking gene. If
the neighbor genes overlapped the VS by less than these
50 bp, the overlapping was considered negligible and
the locus was considered as intergenic.

Source of other E. coli variable segment

Detection of repeats flanking variable segments

For all E. coli VSs that did not correspond to the above
mentioned annotations, an estimation of their content
was carried out using Blast against the EMBL NonRedundant database, and the result was considered positive if at least 90% identity over at least 90% of the
length was obtained. Results were parsed using the following categories: DNA segment present in at least one
other E. coli strain (except very close kin such as
EDL933, which is clonally related to the Sakai strain, or
W3110, related to MG1655); DNA segment present in
another bacterial species or a non-cultivable sample; no
match in the Non-Redundant database.

For all VSs, a DNA fragment encompassing the VS and
500 bp flanking each side was extracted. Repeat detection was done with the Vmatch software [87], using a
three step procedure. First, VS boundaries were scanned
for the presence of repeats of length = 11 bp, allowing
10% divergence between the repeats, and a misplacement of the repeat of 10 bp around the position of the
VS boundary. If no repeat was found, a second search of
repeats of length >10 bp with a Hamming distance of 1
was carried out. A final scan was done in case of repeat
detection failure, for exact repeats ≥ 5 bp (this value
was chosen based on an example of a known, accurate
deletion of genes yafN and yafO that occurred between
a 5-bp repeat in the CFT073 strain of E. coli), allowing
no misplacement relative to the VS boundary (otherwise, the probability to find such repeats at random is
too high). This last step was found to double the number of VSs flanked by repeats.

elements. PUs separated by less than 100 bp were therefore associated in a unique mosaic element. Application
of this pattern to the MG1655 complete genome allows
detection of 80% of the 266 PUs or mosaics described in
[85].
Minisatellites

Variable segment analysis
Data preparation

Coordinates of the VSs for all four alignments were
downloaded from the MOSAIC web site [55]. A script
written in Python allowed us to analyze the VSs, in
which the central object was the ‘locus’ class, composed
of all VSs belonging to the same locus. Boundaries of
some of the VSs as generated by the aligner were sometimes inexact, in the sense that the DNA content of the
boundary (usually not more than 20 to 100 bp) was
more than 90% identical in all VSs. A pre-treatment of
the VS arrays was therefore performed to trim such
boundaries (and sometimes remove a VS when its size
shrank below 20 bp). As a result, some of the VSs
described in the MOSAIC interface are slightly larger
than those considered in this study.
Inspection of variable segment boundaries relative to
backbone genes

For all VSs, a right and left neighboring gene on the
backbone was assigned (the neighbor gene either overlapped the VS or was the first gene next to it). The position of all VSs of a given locus, relative to these genes,
was then analyzed. If all VSs were inside genes, meaning
that the ORF of the genes in all genomes was not interrupted by any of the VSs of the locus, the locus was

Detection of variable segments with similar DNA content

To determine which VSs of a locus had similar content,
pairwise alignments on VSs having similar lengths
(± 10%) were performed using ‘stretcher’ (EMBOSS
suite). A similar content was attributed if more than
76% identity was found over at least 90% of the smaller
VS length. A final step controlled that all relationships
within the locus were transitive.
