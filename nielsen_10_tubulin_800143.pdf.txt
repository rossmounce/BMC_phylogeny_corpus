subfunctionalization provide specialized isoforms
in a functionally constrained gene family

Abstract
Background: The completion of 19 insect genome sequencing projects spanning six insect orders provides the
opportunity to investigate the evolution of important gene families, here tubulins. Tubulins are a family of eukaryotic
structural genes that form microtubules, fundamental components of the cytoskeleton that mediate cell division,
shape, motility, and intracellular trafficking. Previous in vivo studies in Drosophila find a stringent relationship between
tubulin structure and function; small, biochemically similar changes in the major alpha 1 or testis-specific beta 2
tubulin protein render each unable to generate a motile spermtail axoneme. This has evolutionary implications, not a
single non-synonymous substitution is found in beta 2 among 17 species of Drosophila and Hirtodrosophila flies
spanning 60 Myr of evolution. This raises an important question, How do tubulins evolve while maintaining their
function? To answer, we use molecular evolutionary analyses to characterize the evolution of insect tubulins.
Results: Sixty-six alpha tubulins and eighty-six beta tubulin gene copies were retrieved and subjected to molecular
evolutionary analyses. Four ancient clades of alpha and beta tubulins are found in insects, a major isoform clade (alpha
1, beta 1) and three minor, tissue-specific clades (alpha 2-4, beta 2-4). Based on a Homarus americanus (lobster)
outgroup, these were generated through gene duplication events on major beta and alpha tubulin ancestors, followed
by subfunctionalization in expression domain. Strong purifying selection acts on all tubulins, yet maximum pairwise
amino acid distances between tubulin paralogs are large (0.464 substitutions/site beta tubulins, 0.707 alpha tubulins).
Conversely orthologs, with the exception of reproductive tissue isoforms, show little sequence variation except in the
last 15 carboxy terminus tail (CTT) residues, which serve as sites for post-translational modifications (PTMs) and
interactions with microtubule-associated proteins. CTT residues overwhelming comprise the co-evolving residues
between Drosophila alpha 2 and beta 3 tubulin proteins, indicating CTT specializations can be mediated at the level of
the tubulin dimer. Gene duplications post-dating separation of the insect orders are unevenly distributed, most often
appearing in major alpha 1 and minor beta 2 clades. More than 40 introns are found in tubulins. Their distribution
among tubulins reveals that insertion and deletion events are common, surprising given their potential for disrupting
tubulin coding sequence. Compensatory evolution is found in Drosophila beta 2 tubulin cis-regulation, and reveals
selective pressures acting to maintain testis expression without the use of previously identified testis cis-regulatory
elements.
Conclusion: Tubulins have stringent structure/function relationships, indicated by strong purifying selection, the loss
of many gene duplication products, alpha-beta co-evolution in the tubulin dimer, and compensatory evolution in beta
2 tubulin cis-regulation. They evolve through gene duplication, subfunctionalization in expression domain and
divergence of duplication products, largely in CTT residues that mediate interactions with other proteins. This has
resulted in the tissue-specific minor insect isoforms, and in particular the highly diverse α3, α4, and β2 reproductive
tissue-specific tubulin isoforms, illustrating that even a highly conserved protein family can participate in the adaptive
process and respond to sexual selection.

Background
Proteins vary in the stringency of their structure/function
relationships, which may affect their ability to participate
in the adaptive process [1]. Nature has ready opportunity
to shape the phenotype through selection on proteins
that show non-synonymous allelic variation, for example
esterases [2] and glycolytic enzymes [3]. Other proteins,
for example actins, show little amino acid variation (~57% across metazoans, [4]), and tend to loose function
entirely rather than provide altered function in response
to change in their amino acid sequence [5]. Such proteins
may not typically admit allelic variation, which raises an
old, but important question: is selection a shaper of diversity, or merely an executioner [6]?
One of the best-studied proteins with respect to its
structure/function relationship is tubulin. In vivo studies
of alpha and beta tubulin in the Drosophila melanogaster
spermtail axoneme find that small changes in the amino
acid sequence of the major alpha 1 or testis-specific beta
2 tubulin protein render each unable to generate a motile
axoneme [7-10]. This stringency has evolutionary implications; comparisons of beta 2 sequences among different
species of Drosophila find not a single non-synonymous
substitution, indicating the protein has not changed in
sequence for more than 60 million years [11]. Together
these results indicate that only rarely does beta 2 participate in the adaptive process.
For proteins with stringent structure/function relationships, evolving while maintaining function is problematic. Gene duplication is a fundamental mechanism in
answer to this problem [12], yet without additional
changes, in expression domain and/or in the proteins
with which it co-functions, a duplicate copy will have the
same function as the original, will experience the same
selective regime as the original and so will not evolve.
Here we characterize insect tubulin evolution, to identify events that release tubulins to evolve, and to more
generally serve as a model for the evolution of functionally constrained proteins. Tubulins are a family of eukaryotic structural proteins that comprise microtubules,
fundamental components of the spindle in cell division,
the axoneme in cilia and flagella, mediators of cell shape,
and dynein/kinesin-based cell trafficking [13-15]. Two
members of the tubulin family, alpha and beta tubulin,
form a dimer that is the building block of the microtubule. All eukaryotes contain at least one major alpha (α1)
and beta (β1) tubulin. In addition, Drosophila melanogaster express minor, tissue-specific isoforms in the
motile spermtail axoneme (β2), pre-adult tissues (β3, β4,
and α2), and the ovary (α4) [16,17].
We studied tubulin evolution in two hemimetabolous
insect orders, Phthiraptera (Pediculus humanus corporis,
body louse) and Hemiptera (Acyrthosiphon pisum, pea
aphid), and four holometabolous orders, Hymenoptera

(Apis millifera honeybee, Nasonia vitripennis jewel
wasp), Coleoptera (Tribolium castenatum flour beetle),
Lepidoptera (Bombyx mori silkmoth), and Diptera (Aedes
aegypti, Anopheles gambiae, and Drosophila melanogaster, D. sechellia, D. yakuba, D. erecta, D. simulans, D.
mojavensis, D. grimshawi, D. ananassae, D. persimilis, D.
psuedoobscura, D. virilis, D. willistoni). These orders represent well over 80% of the diversity in all insect species
[18]. Their evolutionary relationships are not controversial, and each of these orders is considered to be monophyletic [19]. They are known to be quite ancient, the
origin of these insect orders has been dated to be >300
Mya using a molecular clock [20], with the oldest beetle
(Coleopteran) fossils from the Lower Permian (about 265
million years ago [21]) and the earliest fly (Diptera) fossil
from the Upper Triassic of the Mesozoic geological
period, some 225 million years ago [22].
We find four clades of alpha and beta tubulins in insects
that, for the most part, do not evolve without a gene
duplication event. Yet gene duplication is not sufficient to
release tubulin evolution, most duplication products are
lost, and major tubulin duplication products do not
evolve unless followed by subfunctionalization in expression domain. Subfunctionalization has resulted in a number of reproductive tissue-specific tubulins that are
diverse in sequence, particularly in CTT residues that
mediate integrations with other proteins. Together these
results indicate that tubulin evolution is constrained, yet
tubulins can in fact participate in the adaptive process.

Methods
Sequence retrieval

Insect tubulins were obtained through BLAST [23]
searches of the sequenced insect genome databases http:/
/flybase.bio.indiana.edu/
and
NCBI
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ databases using Drosophila melanogaster tubulin cDNAs as query sequences. Tubulin
exon/intron structure was determined by aligning
retrieved genomic sequences to their Drosophila cDNA
orthologs using Sequencher 4.1 (Gene Codes Corporation [24]).
Genealogical reconstruction

DNA sequence alignments were made using ClustalW
[25] in the MEGA v. 4.0 software package [26]. Translated
sequences were aligned using BLOSUM [27] (gap opening penalty 100, extension penalty 0.1), refined by hand,
and untranslated for genealogical analysis using the
Bayesian method as implemented in Mr. Bayes v. 3.1.2
[28]). For both alpha and beta tubulins a GTR model was
used with 4 rate categories, gamma corrections were estimated by the program, and gaps were coded. For beta
tubulins, the analysis was done using first and second
codon positions (88 sequences, 947 sites, gamma correc-

tion α = 0.542); for alpha tubulins zero-fold degenerate
codon positions (69 sequences, 811 sites, gamma correction α = 0.486). Analyses were run until the standard
deviation of split frequencies was below 0.01, for the
alpha tubulins 4,000,000 generations and beta tubulins
1,500,000 generations. A 25% burnin was performed [28],
and the majority-rule consensus tree is reported.

requires 1) multiple sequences for comparison, 2)
sequence variation among those sequences, and 3)
knowledge that the alpha and beta isoforms are coexpressed in a cell. These conditions are met only by the
Drosophila α2 and β3 tubulins, which co-function in visceral mesoderm, the testis cyst cells, and pre-adult sensory neurons [7,8].

Pairwise amino acid distances

Evolution of Drosophila Beta 2 tubulin cis-regulation

The average and maximum pairwise amino acid distances
(number of amino acid differences/site) between paralogs
and orthologs are presented, these were generated using
the Poisson correction method in MEGA v. 4 [26]; standard error estimates were obtained by a bootstrap procedure (2000 replications).

An opportunity to study cis-regulatory aspects of tubulin
evolution is provided by the D. melanogaster β2 gene.
Three aspects of Dmβ2 regulation have been identified,
the β2UE1 element, required for testis-specific gene
expression, and the β2UE2 and β2DE1 elements for
proper expression levels [33]; these elements are identifiable in most Drosophila species. The core promoter does
not contain a TATA box, but uses an Inr sequence found
in many TATA-less promoters. We identified these
sequences in Drosophila species by scanning the 1000
base pairs 5' to transcription start for identical and
degenerate sequence matches to Dmβ2 regulation, using
Sequencher.
To determine if Drosophila β2 is expressed in the testis
in species in which these sequences were not found, a
PCR approach was used. RNA was extracted from 20
pairs of dissected testes using a guanidine hydrochloride,
phenol/chloroform method [34], and DNAase treated to
remove DNA contaminants (New England Biolabs). Beta
2-specific primers were used in a reverse transcription
reaction, followed by PCR amplification, to identify β2
mRNA in testes. For a negative control, PCR was performed on the same RNA template, minus the reverse
transcription reaction.

Test of selection

Since tubulins do not appear to be evolving at appreciable
rates, they are probably under severe purifying selection.
On the other hand, the carboxy terminus tails, which
mediate tubulin functional specializations via interactions with other proteins, and are released from protein
folding constraints because they lie on the surface of the
MT [29], are the most rapidly evolving, and possibly
under positive selection. These two hypotheses were
tested, first by means of estimating dN (the number of
nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site),
dS (the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site), and the ratio dN/dS (ω) by the ML method as
implemented
in
PAML
v4.3b
http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html[30], and then by
means of a likelihood ratio test comparing the null model
H0 with ω = 1 fixed and the alternative model H1 with ω
estimated from the data.
Rate tests

The tubulins were tested for the molecular clock, to
determine: 1) if paralogous tubulins resulting from
ancient duplication events (preceding separation of
insect orders) evolve at the same rate, 2) if orthologous
tubulins evolve at the same rate, and 3) if paralogous
tubulins resulting from recent duplication events (postdating separation of the insect orders) diverge following
duplication. All rate tests were performed using Tajima's
relative rates test in MEGA v. 3.0 [26,31].
Test of co-evolution

Stringency in tubulin structure/function relationships
may result from the need to maintain proper lateral and
longitudinal contacts between alpha and beta tubulin in
the microtubule, such that the alpha and beta tubulins
must co-evolve for either tubulin component to evolve.
Sato's mirror-tree method [32] compares partial correlation coefficients between candidate co-evolving proteins'
distance matrices to identify co-evolution. This test

Results
Sequence retrieval and genealogical reconstruction

A total of 86 beta tubulins and 66 alpha tubulins were
obtained through blast searches of the completed insect
genome projects and NCBI databases (Tables 1, 2; Additional File 1). Homarus americana (American lobster;
Crustacea, Decapoda) tubulins were used as an outgroup
in the genealogical reconstruction, because Homarus is
the closest relation to insects for which the full complement of tubulins has been identified. Homarus has two
major beta tubulin isoforms and three major alpha tubulins. Based on this outgroup, duplication products of
major alpha and beta tubulin isoforms gave rise to the
insect major and minor tubulins.
Beta tubulins

There is posterior probability support (provided in
parentheses for the remainder of this section) for four
monophyletic beta tubulin clades in insects (Figs. 1, 2).
Orthologs of the Dmβ1 isoform (0.74) form a clade of

Features of the four beta tubulin isoforms identified in insects are presented. The function and/or expression domain of each sequence in D. melanogaster [16,17] and B. mori [35], the two insects
in which tubulin expression and function have been studied, are presented in Column 2. Average and maximum pairwise distance calculations in Column 3 refer to the average # amino acid
differences/site among conserved isoforms, and the maximum pairwise distance between any two orthologs, including divergent duplication products, respectively. For "all insects", the only
Drosophila species included is Dm, to avoid a Dipteran skew in the results. CTT sequences are presented in Column 4, for purposes of inspection as they constitute ~50% of the differences among
tubulins. Tubulin post-translational modifications (PTMs) occur on sequence motifs whose presence and absence are presented in the Column 5. Polyglutamylation and polyglycylation
sequence motifs are degenerate, the "?" indicates that a potentially modifiable, but experimentally uncharacterized residue(s) is present for these PTMs. Unusual sequence features or motifs
known to mediate specific tubulin functional specializations are also noted. The full-length sequences for Nvβ1, Phβ3, Dpβ3, Dsβ3 were not available. Key: Pediculus humanus corporisPh,

Features of the four alpha tubulin isoforms identified in insects are presented. The function and/or expression domain of each sequence in D. melanogaster [16,17] and B. mori [35], the two insects
in which tubulin expression and function have been studied, are presented in Column 2. Average and maximum pairwise ("All Insects" only) distance calculations in Column 3 refer to the average #
amino acid differences/site among conserved isoforms, and the maximum pairwise distance between any two orthologs, including divergent duplication products, respectively. For "all insects", the
only Drosophila species included is Dm, to avoid a Dipteran skew in the results. CTT sequences are presented in Column 4, for purposes of inspection as they constitute ~50% of the differences among
tubulins. Tubulin post-translational modifications (PTMs) occur on sequence motifs whose presence and absence are presented in the Column 5. Polyglutamylation and polyglycylation sequence
motifs are degenerate, the "?" indicates that a potentially modifiable, but experimentally uncharacterized residue(s) is present for these PTMs. Unusual sequence features or motifs known to mediate
specific tubulin functional specializations are also noted. The full-length sequences for Nvβ1, Phβ3, Dpβ3, Dsβ3 were not available. Key: Pediculus humanus corporisPh, Acyrthosiphon pisum Ap, Apis

Figure 1 Beta tubulin genealogy. Bayesian reconstruction of insect beta tubulin evolutionary relationships. Eighty-six tubulins were analyzed with
Homarus americanus (Crustacea, Decapoda) beta tubulins as the outgroup. There are four beta tubulin clades ancestral to insects, the posterior probability scores in support of these clades are in larger font in the figure: β1 (0.74), β2 (0.77), β3 (1.00) and β4 (0.90). Removal of the 5 most divergent
tubulins (Tcβ2b, Nvβ2b, c, Phβ4, and Apβ4) results in support >0.97 for each clade.

Figure 2 Summary of tubulin isoform relationships. Each of the β1, β2, β3, and β4 isoforms is represented in both hemimetabolous and holometabolous insect taxa, indicating they evolved prior to the separation of these taxa. The β2 isoform duplicated in holometabolous insects following their
separation from hemimetabolous insects, based on the clade containing Amβ2b, Nvβ2b, Nvβ2c, Tcβ2b. The β2b isoform was lost in the Lepidoptera/
Diptera ancestor, and the β2c isoform was lost in every holometabolous taxa except Nv. The β4 isoform is represented in hemimetabolous insects and
Diptera, indicating independent losses in Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and Lepidoptera. Each of the α1, α2, and α4 isoforms are represented in both
hemimetabolous and holometabolous insect taxa, indicating they evolved prior to the separation of these taxa. The α3 isoforms, present in Tc and Bm,
fall within the α1 isoforms, suggesting its origin in a duplication event in the common ancestor of Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera that was lost
in Dipterans.

major somatic isoforms, the most conserved in sequence
of the insect beta tubulins (Table 1). This gene duplicated
in a Bombyx ancestor, giving rise to Bmβ1a and Bmβ1b
(1.0).
A second clade consists of orthologs to the Dmβ2 isoform (0.77), which is testis-specific in both Bm and Dm
and supports the motile axoneme [16,17,35]. Insect β2
tubulins share a Gly62 which mediates doublet microtubule interactions [36], and a carboxy terminus axoneme
motif "EGEFXXX" (X = Asp or Glu, [37,38]), which serves
as a substrate for polyglutamylation and polyglycylation
[39,40], post-translational modifications characteristic of
motile axonemes. Conversely, the Thr61 Gly62 Ala63 motif,
which contributes to the extreme length of the D. melanogaster spermtail [10], is a unique feature of the Drosophila β2 protein. Beta 2 duplicated a number of times, in
a Pediculus ancestor (Phβ2a, b: 1.0), an Acyrthosiphon
ancestor (Apβ2a-d: 1.0), and in a holometabolous ancestor that is not resolved but inferred by the presence of
multiple β2 genes in these taxa (Amβ2b; Nvβ2b, c; Tcβ2b:
(0.82)) and was followed by losses of the β2b and β2c
products in most taxa (Figs. 1, 2).
A third clade consists in orthologs of the Dmβ3 isoform
(1.00), expressed in pre-adult visceral mesoderm, the testis cyst cells, and sensory neurons [16,17,35]. Beta 3
orthologs contain a 6 codon insertion (5 in Phβ3) in the
internal variable region of the gene, and are the only beta
tubulins that have not duplicated in insects. A fourth
clade consists in orthologs of the Dmβ4 isoform (0.90),
which is expressed in pre-adult tissues [16,17]. Beta 4
orthologs are the most variable beta tubulins in sequence
and in representation among insects, having been lost in
the Tc, Am, and Bm lineages. One Beta 4 duplication
event is found in insects, in an Aedes ancestor (1.0).
Alpha tubulins

There is support for four alpha tubulin insect clades,
though their relationships are less resolved than the beta
tubulins (Figs. 2, 3). There is a major α1 clade with
numerous polytomies (0.68). These are orthologs of the
major Drosophila α1 isoform, expressed in somatic cells
and the testis [16,17], and are most conserved alpha tubulins (Table 2). The second clade consists in the minor α2
isoforms (0.95) expressed in Drosophila visceral mesoderm and testis cyst cells [8,16,17]. The α2 isoform is
absent in Acyrthosiphon, Nasonia, Anopheles, and D. persimilis and D. psuedoobscura. The α3 clade (1.0) are
orthologs of the Bmα3 testis-specific isoforms [35]. The
alpha 3 clade falls within the α1 tubulins, indicating its
origin in an α1 duplication event in a Coleopteran/Lepidopteran/Dipteran ancestor that was lost in Dipterans.
The fourth clade consists in the α4 isoforms (0.97), which
is ovary-specific in Dm [16,17], with losses in Ap, Nv, Bm,
and Ae.

Page 10 of 21

Duplications of the major α1 isoform occurred in a
number of insect lineages Acyrthosiphon (Apα1a-c: (0.97,
0.94), Hymenoptera [Apis (Amα1a, b) and Nasonia
(Nvα1a-c): (0.96)]. While not supported in the zero-fold
degeneracy codon tree, a three codon NJ tree (not shown)
provides strong support for independent α1 duplication
events in Aedes α1a, b:(99), Anopheles Agα1a, b:(98) and
melanogaster subgroup Drosophila Ds, Dc, Dy, De and
Dmα1a, b: (99) ancestors respectively.
Sequence distances and carboxy terminus tail sequences

The greatest pairwise distances between any two beta
and alpha tubulin protein sequences are 0.464 (Tcβ4 vs.
Nvβ1) and 0.700 (Agα2 vs. Amα4) respectively, which
reveals that a wide range of amino acid sequence identities are capable of supporting microtubule assembly per
se (Tables 1, 2). Within this overall diversity, orthologs
sequence identities are highly conserved, with average
pairwise distances among orthologs less than 0.011 for
the major α1 and β1 isoforms, and less than 0.140 for the
α2, β2 (excluding divergent duplication products), β3, and
β4 minor isoforms. This suggests that tubulin evolution is
not constrained by microtubule assembly, but by cell-type
specific functions. The α3 testis and α4 ovary-specific
isoforms, and testis β2 tubulin duplication products are
exceptions, with average pairwise distances >0.23, >0.55
and >0.46 respectively. These reproductive isoforms are
the most variable tubulins in sequence. The major isoforms are the most conserved, and there is not a single
non-synonymous substitution among the Drosophila β1
and α1 tubulins.
Over 50% of the residues that distinguish tubulin paralogs from each other are found in the carboxy terminus
tails (CTT). The CTT lies on the surface of the tubulin
protein, being free from protein folding permits its
greater variability [29]. Because it serves as a site for
many tubulin post-translational modifications (PTMs)
and for binding tubulin interacting proteins, it is an
important mediator of tubulin function.
PTM motifs

Tubulins can undergo numerous post-translational modifications, which occur on specific tubulin sequence
motifs. Polyglutamylation, polyglycylation, detyrosination, and acetylation are modifications associated with
stable MT arrays and motile axonemes [40,41], phosphorylated MTs are excluded from mitotic arrays [42], palmitoylation may contribute to the membrane localization of
tubulin [43], and interactions with +TIPS (plus-end
tracking proteins) have been shown to be inhibited by
detyrosination [44].
PTMs that occur on the beta tubulins are polyglutamylation and polyglycylation on a subset of glutamic acid
residues on the CTTs [38-40], and phosphorylation of a

Figure 3 Alpha tubulin genealogy. Bayesian reconstruction of insect alpha tubulin evolutionary relationships. Eighty-four tubulins were analyzed
with Homarus americanus (Crustacea, Decapoda) alpha tubulins as the outgroup. There are four alpha tubulin clades ancestral to insects, the posterior
probability scores in support of these clades are in larger font in the figure: α1 (0.68) which contains numerous polytomies; α2 (0.95); α3 (1.0) present
in Bombyx and Tribolium; and α4 (0.97).

conserved Ser178 [42]; these sites are found on most beta
tubulins (Table 1). The same PTMs that occur on beta
tubulins also occur on alpha tubulins, in addition, alpha
tubulins can undergo acetylation of Lys40, detyrosination
of the 3' terminal Tyr, and palmitoylation of Cys387 [[4345]; Table 2]. Alpha tubulins show much more variation
in PTM motifs than beta tubulins, both between paralogs
and among orthologs, indicating alpha tubulins more
typically underlie PTM-based microtubule specializations. Note that presence of a PTM sequence motif is
necessary, but not sufficient for a PTM to occur; regulation of tubulin modifying proteins will play an important
role in PTM-based cell type specializations.
Selection Tests

Selection tests performed between Drosophila tubulin
orthologs and recent gene duplication products (Bmβ1a,
b; Tcβ2a, b; Nvβ2a-c; Apβ2a-d; Aeβ4a, b; Aeα1a, b;
Agα1a, b; Amα1a, b; Nvα1a-c; Apα1a-c) find strong purifying selection; dN/dS ranges from 0.070 to 0.000 in all
pairwise comparisons with a high degree of statistical significance (p = 0.00) (Additional File 2). The last 60 nucleotides that comprise the CTT were also tested for mode
of selection based on their different role in tubulin folding
and function [29]. There is evidence of positive selection
acting on the CTT of insect β2 duplication products, and
on some D. spp. α4 tubulins (p < 0.01), however, the small
alignment length after gap removal requires this result be
taken with caution.
Rate Tests

The branch lengths in the genealogy indicate clear differences in tubulin evolutionary dynamics not captured by
tests of selection, such that we used Tajima's rate test to
identify substitution rate difference among tubulin proteins.
Rates tests between ancient tubulin paralogs

The major and minor insect isoforms have their origin in
duplication events on major tubulin ancestors. The lack
of overlap in major and minor isoform expression
domains in Bombyx and Drosophila, the two insects in
which expression data is available, indicates subfunctionalization followed these duplication events, resulting in
the minor isoforms. Amino acid rate tests find that minor
tubulins evolve more rapidly than major α1 and β1 tubulins (Table 3); divergence in sequence followed duplication and subfunctionalization.
Rate tests between tubulin orthologs

Tubulin major isoform orthologs vary in the amount of
pleiotropy in their function, which may have rate effects.
All insects have a β2 and β3 isoforms, but some do not
have β4, α2, α3 and/or α4 isoforms. In these taxa the
major isoform takes on this minor isoform function,
resulting in different amounts of pleiotropy for the major

Page 12 of 21

isoforms. For example, the major Nvα1 isoform supports
both somatic, testis, and ovary alpha tubulin function, vs.
the Tcα1 isoform that only supports somatic function.
These differences in pleiotropy do not affect their rates of
evolution, all of the insect major α1 and β1 proteins
evolve at the same rate respectively (Table 4).
The tubulin minor orthologs in general evolve at the
same rate (Table 4), with the exception of the α4 ovaryspecific proteins, and divergent testis β2 duplication
products (Table 5).
Recent duplication events

With respect to more recent duplication events, those
post-dating separation of the insect orders, gene duplication did not necessarily result in divergent duplication
products. Most recent gene duplications appear in the
major alpha 1 and minor beta 2 clades. Recent duplication events always generated at least one conserved product (evolving at the same rate as its orthologs in taxa that
did not experience gene duplication). The second product was also conserved in two of eight minor β2 isoform
duplication events, and in six of the eight major α1 isoform duplications (Table 5).
The Bmβ1a and Bmβ1b duplication products are
undergoing subfunctionalization. Both have wide, but
only partially overlapping expression domains; of 16
expression domains tested, they overlap in five, nine are
unique to Bmβ1a, and two are unique to Bmβ1b [35].
Both Bmβ1a and Bmβ1b proteins have the same substitution rates as other β1 isoforms (Table 5). The Dmα1a, b
products of the melanogaster subgroup α1 duplication
are also undergoing subfunctionalization, but of a different kind. Dmα1b it is expressed in the same domain as
the Dmα1a duplication product, but at much reduced
levels [16,17]. These products are evolving at the same,
slow rate as the other α1 proteins (Table 5).
Co-evolution between alpha and beta tubulin

Co-functional links between alpha and beta tubulin must
be relatively strong to be detected in co-evolution
between proteins. Nonetheless, Sato's Mirror-Tree test of
co-evolution finds that the alpha-beta tubulins in the
Drosophila α2-β3 dimer co-evolve (Correlation 0.4258, p
< 0.01). As there is nothing unusual about the α2-β3
dimer to indicate it is not representative of other tubulins,
co-function in the dimer may attenuate rates of tubulin
evolution, as change in one tubulin to some extent
requires change in the other. Contacts between alpha and
beta tubulin along the protofilament and between filaments (inter- and intradimer contacts) are known [46],
based on these, none of the α2-β3 co-evolving amino
acids are in contact with each other. On the other hand,
the CTT residues are sites of PTMs, and co-function in
this regard could underlie α2-β3 co-evolution. Evolving
amino acids in α2: (first, nucleotide-binding domain: 42,
50, 68, 70, 128; second, taxol-binding domain: 236, 289;

Intron evolution

Forty-five different introns are present in alpha and beta
tubulins (Fig. 4, Additional Files 3, 4), and their distribution indicates they are very mobile. Given the potential
for intron insertion and removal to alter tubulin coding
sequence, the abundance and dynamic movement of
introns among tubulins is surprising.
One way to assess intron evolution is to plot their presence on an insect phylogeny [19], and assume that introns
present in more than one isoform were present in the
major isoform ancestor to all insect tubulins (Fig. 4).
Twenty-three beta tubulin introns were identified. The
DGIPRST and U introns each are unique gains in the beta
tubulins in which they reside. The CJMP and Q introns
are common to insect β4, with losses of MP and Q in Dipteran β4. The remaining 9 introns, ABEFHKLNO, are
present in >1 beta tubulin isoform, suggesting they were
present in the major beta ancestor to the insect tubulins.
However, except for the A intron, the number of independent losses required for this explanation seems sufficiently large to argue against it. Rather, a combination of
independent gains, losses, and lateral transfer via recombination between paralogs, for example in EN and P,
likely explains their representation.
Twenty-two alpha tubulin introns were identified.
Eleven introns, BFHIKLPQRTU, are unique gains in the

alpha tubulins in which they reside. Three introns, DM
and S, are found only in α2 isoforms. The remaining
seven introns, ACEGJN and O, are present in >1 isoform.
Again, except for the A intron, their presence/absence
patterns require too many independent losses to assume
they were present in the major alpha ancestor to the
insect tubulins.
An important mechanism of intron loss is through
recombination with reverse transcribed tubulin mRNA
sequences [47,48]. The most 5' introns are in general the
most conserved in both alpha and beta tubulins, consistent with this mechanism. Mechanisms of intron insertion remain largely a mystery [49,50]. Introns found in
two paralogs in the same species, such as the beta tubulin
EN and P introns and the alpha tubulin E intron, indicate
horizontal transfer of the intron through gene conversion
or double recombination between paralogs [50].
The majority of introns are found at sites that are highly
conserved across all tubulins (Additional Files 3, 4), suggesting intron insertion must accommodate sequence
requirements of the protein, rather than visa versa. There
are preferences for certain amino acids bracketing insertion sites, for example, glycine resides bracket 16% of
intron splice sites, more than twice their frequency in
insect tubulins. There are a few observations indicating
intron insertion either altered coding sequence or
unusual coding sequence facilitated intron insertion. Five
of the 20 unique introns (found only in a single tubulin)
are correlated with unusual amino acid identities at the
insertion sites, the Amα4 F and I introns, the Amα2 H
and G introns, and the Phβ2b D intron.

Protein evolutionary rates were compared among tubulin orthologs. The average +/- Sdv of chi-square values between each tubulin isoform
and its insect orthologs is presented (eg. Dmβ1 = (Chi-sq. Dmβ1 vs. Agβ1 + Chi-sq. Dmβ1 vs. Aeβ1 +...)/8), using Pediculus humanus corporis
orthologs as outgroups; Pediculus rates tested with Acyrthosiphon pisum outgroups. In taxa with multiple copies of an isoform, the conserved
isoform is used in the rate test. *The highly divergent Amα2 isoform is an outlier, and was removed from the analysis. Chi-Sq. values > 3.8 have
a probability of p < 0.05; Chi-Sq. values > 5.2, p < 0.01.

Figure 4 Beta and alpha tubulin introns. Beta and alpha tubulin introns are plotted on an insect phylogeny [19], and on Dmα1 and Dmβ1 protein
sequences. Introns are labeled A-W and A-V, from the most 5' to most 3' intron found in beta and alpha tubulins. Introns for taxa with multiple copies
of an isoform are presented in order, ie. Nvα1a/Nvα1b/Nvα1c.

Nielsen et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:113
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/113

Tubulin introns are typically large and could therefore
be prone to splicing mistakes [51,52]. While orthologspecific introns are likely promoted by selection, by virtue
of the intron insertion event coinciding with the duplication event that led to the isoform, the evolutionary benefit of unique introns in established isoforms requires an
explanation. Alternate splicing is not known in tubulin,
and thus does not provide a utility to introns. However,
regulatory sequences are known to reside in tubulin
introns [7,53,54], and if present provide a plausible benefit for intron insertion into established isoforms. Large
introns could benefit tubulins, as they reduce Hill-Robertson interference within genes [55].
There is evidence that movement from phase 0 to 1 or 2
accompanies the evolution of old introns as splice signals
move from the exon to the intron, while disrupting coding sequence might bias recent introns to phase 0 insertion [56]. There is no association between intron phase
and age, 6/11 conserved (old) introns and 7/20 unique
(new) introns are phase zero, and except in the few previously mentioned cases, intron insertion regardless of
phase does not affect tubulin coding sequence. Intron
splice sites tend to remain conserved over time; only the
beta tubulin Q and R introns and alpha J and K introns
are possibly the same intron undergoing splice site movement.
Evolution of Drosophila beta 2 tubulin cis-regulation

D. melanogaster β2 regulatory elements are conserved in
some Diptera, in others they are not found (Table 6). In a
subset of these species (D. willistoni, D. ananassae, D.
persimilis, D. pseudoobscura) testis expression of the β2
gene was tested, and confirmed through RT-PCR (Fig. 5).
The maintenance of testis expression in view of the loss of
previously identified testis regulatory elements indicates
that compensatory evolution has occurred in their β2 cisregulation. While the basis of this compensation is not
known, it may be more complex than simple re-positioning of regulatory elements, as this would have been identified through our analysis.

Discussion
Tubulins have stringent structure/function relationships,
indicated by strong purifying selection, the loss of many
gene duplication products, alpha-beta co-evolution in the
tubulin dimer, and compensatory evolution in beta 2
tubulin cis-regulation. Gene duplication, subfunctionalization in expression domain, and divergence, particularly in CTT sequences has resulted in the specialized,
minor tissue-specific insect isoforms. Conservation of
ortholog sequence identities and expression patterns in
Bm and Dm suggests ortholog function might be ancient
and largely shared among insects, having been estab-

Page 17 of 21

lished in their common ancestor. The exception to conservation is in the α3, α4, and β2b, c isoforms. The great
sequence variability in these reproductive tissue-specific
tubulins indicates species-specific function, and illustrates that even a highly conserved protein family can
participate in the adaptive process and respond to sexual
selection [57,58].
Pairwise distances between tubulin paralogs reveals a
wide variety of tubulin sequences are able to generate an
MT array, such that the slow rate of ortholog evolution
does not result from a lack of sequences able to generate
microtubule arrays. Furthermore, testis-specific isoforms support a wider diversity of microtubule arrays
than do major somatic tubulins, yet show more sequence
diversity than major isoforms, moreover, somatic tubulins with reproductive function, like Nvα1, do not evolve
more slowly than those without. These observations indicate that pleiotropy in microtubule array support does
not constrain tubulin evolution; more generally, that support of MT arrays per se is not main source of purifying
selection on tubulin sequence.
Path-dependence in the order of amino acid change has
been proposed as an important constraint in the evolution of beta 2 tubulin residues that participate in an
amino acid synergism [1], and may be a general constraint in residues involved in protein folding. This local
constraint would result in purifying selection, yet allow
for variation among paralogs to build over time as viable
evolutionary pathways are found.
In addition, ortholog conservation may result from
support of more subtle, cell-type specific aspects of tubulin function that involve sorting among different MT
arrays and the timing of MT array generation. These
aspects are mediated by CTT sequences. CTTs do not
participate in protein folding, but mediate the tubulin
code by providing sequence motifs for PTMs, and by
mediating interactions with tubulin associated proteins.
CTT sequences can influence subcellular localization of
different MT arrays, interactions with plus-end tracking
proteins (+TIPS) that influence dynamic instability, and
sites for motor proteins to preferentially bind [41]. CTT
variation can provide MT specializations, for example,
insects with unusual axonemes show reduced levels of
both polyglutamylation and polyglycylation [39,59]. Conversely, avoiding unusual MT arrays may contribute to
the conservation of major somatic isoform CTTs, which
need to function in "normal" MT arrays across a diversity
of cell types.
Role of gene duplication in tubulin evolution

Insight into the ancient duplication events that generated
the major and minor insect tubulins can be found in more
recent duplication events. Duplication events that post-

The cis-regulatory elements required for β2 tubulin expression in the testis at appropriate levels have been identified in D. melanogaster;
these sequences (when identifiable) are presented for other Drosophila species. Numerical positions indicating sequence position relative to
transcription start site (= +1). The B2UE1 element is required for testis-specific gene expression, the B2UE2 and B2DE1 elements for proper
expression levels, the Inr element is part of the β2 core promotor, and ATG is the start of β2 coding sequence.

date separation of the insect orders are unevenly distributed among tubulins, with most occurring on alpha 1 and
beta 2 templates. Many duplication products are lost,
likely because they are deleterious; tubulins are incorporated into MT arrays as a function of cellular concentration, thus diverging duplication products have the
potential to poison existing MT arrays, resulting in selection against them. This argues against the classical model

of duplication and divergence [60], as without positive
selection, in most cases a duplicate gene would be lost
before finding novel function. The duplication-degeneration-complementation model [61] proposes that degenerative mutations may accumulate in each duplication
product, resulting in subfunctionalization. This alleviates
the need for positive selection to operate in order to
maintain duplicated genes. Subfunctionalization may

explain why major and minor duplication products differ
in their fate: 8/10 minor isoform duplications result in a
rapidly-evolving and a conserved product, while 7/9
major isoform duplications result in two equally conserved products. Minor isoform expression is already
confined to narrow expression domain, removing cisevolution (and subfunctionalization) as a potential prerequisite for their retention and diversification.
Roles of beta and alpha tubulin in specialized MT arrays

Beta tubulins vary little in PTM sites, such that functional
variation among them resides in the tubulin modifying
protein composition of a cell, not the beta tubulin. Conversely, the alpha tubulins both experience a wider range
of PTMs, and show more variation in PTM sequence
motifs, and therefore might be more fundamental in
mediating the tubulin code.
In addition to this role in PTMs, alpha tubulin may also
have the greater potential to specialize in function,
thereby playing a role in adaptation, because it seems
more dispensable. Only one alpha tubulin, α1, is present
in every insect order, as compared to three beta tubulins,
β1, β2, β3. Loss of the α2 gene in D. persimilis and D.
pseudoobscura correlates with short sperm and oval testis
morphology unique in their genus. Alpha tubulins also
show a great amount of standing variation in "unevolved"
α1 duplication products that have the potential to participate in the adaptive process.
On the other hand, Tuszynski in his review of vertebrate tubulins [15] suggests the beta tubulin component
may be more associated with MT array specializations,
the number of beta minor isoforms is greater in most vertebrates than alpha minor isoforms, and more beta minor
isoforms co-function with a major, "vanilla" alpha major
isoform than visa versa. This seems to also hold largely

Page 19 of 21

true for the insects, as many insect species express only
the major alpha isoform, but multiple beta isoforms,
while all but Bombyx have 4 distinct beta isoforms.
Co-evolution in the alpha/beta tubulin dimer reveals
that both the alpha and the beta component are associated with MT array specializations. Although the particular co-evolving residues do not suggest a clear structural
basis for co-evolution in α2 and β3, a basis for co-evolution in mediating the tubulin code is quite possible in coevolving CTT residues. It has been shown that either the
alpha or beta tubulin CTT can serve as the donor of a
PTM site [62], an interrelationship that provides a mechanism for PTM-based alpha/beta co-evolution. More
generally, specialized MT arrays can be mediated by
either dimer component: the specialized Dmβ2 functions
with the major Dmα1 tubulin in Drosophila axoneme, the
major Dmβ1 functions with a specialized Dmα4 in the
ovary, the minor α3/β2 isoforms support the Bombyx
motile axoneme, and the minor α2/β3 isoforms support
the Drosophila testis cyst cell in which the gigantic spermtails distinctive of Drosophila are generated. Given this
variety of relationships between alpha and beta tubulin
and MT specializations, which component provides specialization may well be due to evolutionary chance.

Conclusion
Gene duplication alone is not sufficient for tubulin evolution. Most gene duplication products do not survive,
whether through direct elimination or pseudogenization.
Those that do survive evolve only when followed by a
narrowing in the expression domain. Given the number
of rare events that must occur (viable gene duplication,
subfunctionalization, path-dependent evolution of coding sequence under purifying selection) to result in a
novel tubulin, their slow rate of evolution seems best
explained by limitations on such opportunities, especially
given the great variation in tubulin proteins found in distance comparisons. Such opportunities do not seem
exhausted given vertebrates express 7-8 alpha and beta
tubulins; the rapid evolution of the reproductive tubulins
also reveals a use for divergent tubulins. It also provides
chance a fundamental role in shaping tubulin evolution it
terms of when these events occur, providing an allele for
selection to choose from. "Evidence" of this role being real
is seen in the odd distribution of isoforms, duplication
events, and divergent duplication products, and which
component of the dimer, alpha, beta, or both, underlies a
microtubule specialization.
One important exception is in reproductive tissue-specific isoforms, which show a large amount of variation
potentially capable of responding to sexual selection, a
fundamental force in insect evolution. Reproductive isoforms have the fewest PTMs, and the most unusual spermtail axonemes are accompanied by reduction of PTM

Nielsen et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:113

modifications [59]. Relaxation of the informational aspect
of tubulin function might release tubulins to contribute
to specialized testis phenotypes typical of insect evolution. Continued study might show more such relaxations,
a form of co-evolution fostering the evolvability of an
important gene family.
