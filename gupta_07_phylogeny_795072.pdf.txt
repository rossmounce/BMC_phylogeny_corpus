Abstract
Background: The Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi species constitute two main groups of the Bacteria that are
closely related in phylogenetic trees. The Bacteroidetes species are widely distributed and include many
important periodontal pathogens. In contrast, all Chlorobi are anoxygenic obligate photoautotrophs. Very
few (or no) biochemical or molecular characteristics are known that are distinctive characteristics of these
bacteria, or are commonly shared by them.
Results: Systematic blast searches were performed on each open reading frame in the genomes of
Porphyromonas gingivalis W83, Bacteroides fragilis YCH46, B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482, Gramella forsetii
KT0803, Chlorobium luteolum (formerly Pelodictyon luteolum) DSM 273 and Chlorobaculum tepidum (formerly
Chlorobium tepidum) TLS to search for proteins that are uniquely present in either all or certain subgroups
of Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi. These studies have identified > 600 proteins for which homologues are not
found in other organisms. This includes 27 and 51 proteins that are specific for most of the sequenced
Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi genomes, respectively; 52 and 38 proteins that are limited to species from the
Bacteroidales and Flavobacteriales orders, respectively, and 5 proteins that are common to species from
these two orders; 185 proteins that are specific for the Bacteroides genus. Additionally, 6 proteins that are
uniquely shared by species from the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi phyla (one of them also present in the
Fibrobacteres) have also been identified. This work also describes two large conserved inserts in DNA
polymerase III (DnaE) and alanyl-tRNA synthetase that are distinctive characteristics of the Chlorobi species
and a 3 aa deletion in ClpB chaperone that is mainly found in various Bacteroidales, Flavobacteriales and
Flexebacteraceae, but generally not found in the homologs from other organisms. Phylogenetic analyses of
the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi species is also reported based on concatenated sequences for 12 conserved
proteins by different methods including the character compatibility (or clique) approach. The placement
of Salinibacter ruber with other Bacteroidetes species was not resolved by other phylogenetic methods, but
this affiliation was strongly supported by the character compatibility approach.
Conclusion: The molecular signatures described here provide novel tools for identifying and
circumscribing species from the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi phyla as well as some of their main groups in
clear terms. These results also provide strong evidence that species from these two phyla (and also
possibly Fibrobacteres) are specifically related to each other and they form a single superphylum. Functional
studies on these proteins and indels should aid in the discovery of novel biochemical and physiological
characteristics that are unique to these groups of bacteria.

Background
The Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi presently comprise two of
the main phyla within the Bacteria [1-3]. The bacteria
from the Bacteroidetes phylum (previously known as the
Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides
(CFB)
group)
exhibit a potpourri of phenotypes including gliding behavior and their ability to digest and grow on a variety of
complex substrates such as cellulose, chitin and agar [4-8].
They inhabit diverse habitats including the oral cavity of
humans, the gastrointestinal tracts of mammals, saturated
thalassic brines, soil and fresh water [9-13]. The Bacteroides species such as B. thetaiotaomicron and B. fragilis are
among the dominant microbes in the large intestine of
human and other animals [14,15]. These bacteria in the
human colon are also important opportunistic pathogens
and they are involved in causing abscesses and soft tissue
infections of the gastrointestinal tract, as well as diarrheal
diseases [15-18]. Other bacteroidetes species, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia, are major
causative agents in the initiation and progression of periodontal disease in humans [12,19,20].
In contrast to wide distribution of Bacteroidetes species in
diverse habitats, bacteria from the phylum Chlorobi
occupy a narrow environmental niche mainly consisting
of anoxic aquatic settings in stratified lakes (chemocline
regions), where sunlight is able to penetrate [21-24].
Some of these bacteria also exist as epibionts in phototrophic consortiums with other bacteria, particularly βproteobacteria [21,25]. The Chlorobi, which are also commonly known as Green Sulfur bacteria, are all anoxygenic
obligate photoautotrophs, which obtain electrons for
anaerobic photosynthesis from hydrogen sulfide
[22,23,26]. Although the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi are
presently recognized as two distinct phyla [1,3], these two
groups are closely related in phylogenetic trees based on
16S rRNA as well other gene sequences [27-30]. Conserved indels (i.e. inserts or deletions) in a number of
widely distributed proteins (viz. FtsK, UvrB and ATP synthase α subunit), that are uniquely present in species from
these two groups, also strongly indicate that these two
groups of species shared a common ancestor exclusive of
all other bacteria [30].
The species from the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi phyla are
presently distinguished from other bacteria primarily on
the basis of their branching in phylogenetic trees [2,3,27].
We have previously described a 4 aa conserved insert in
DNA Gyrase B as well as a 45 aa conserved insert in SecA
protein that were specific for the Bacteroidetes species [30].
In Chlorobi as well as Chloroflexi species, their light harvesting pigments are located in unique membrane-attached
sac-like structures referred to as 'chlorosomes'
[22,24,31,32]. A number of genes involved in the synthesis of chlorosomes components in Chlorobi have been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/71

identified by genomic and mutational analysis [26] and a
few of them, viz. Fenna-Matthew-Olson (FMO) protein
[33], are unique for this group [32,34]. However, the
number of characteristics that are either unique to species
from these two phyla, or are commonly shared by members of these phyla, are very limited. In the past few years,
complete genomes of several Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi
species have become available (see Table 1). Additionally,
sequencing of genomes for many other Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi species is at different stages of completion (see Table
1), but considerable sequence information for these
genomes is available in the NCBI database.
The availability of genomic sequences provide an opportunity to carry out in depth studies to identify novel
molecular characteristics that are unique to these groups
of bacteria and can be used for their diagnostics as well as
biochemical and functional studies. Earlier comparative
genomic studies on Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi species have
been limited to only a few species and they have focused
on specific aspects. The studies by Kuwahara [35] and Cerdeño-Tárraga et al. [16], who sequenced the genomes of B.
fragilis strains, revealed that these genomes contained
extensive DNA inversions in comparison to B. thetaiotaomicron. These inversion events are indicated to be important
in terms of generating cell surface variability in these bacteria to avoid their recognition by the immune system.
Large expansion of genes involved in the biosynthesis of
cell surface polysaccharides and other antigens was also
noted in these genomes [16,35]. A comparative analysis
by Eisen et al. [24] of C. tepidum TLS genome identified
many probable cases of lateral gene transfers (LGTs)
between this species and Archaea; in all about 12% of C.
tepidum's proteins were indicated to be most similar to
those from the archaea. Similarly, the analysis of S. ruber
genome by Mongodin et al. [36] has identified many cases
of potential LGT between S. ruber and haloarchaea, particularly involving the rhodopsin genes.
In our recent work, we have used comparative genomics
to systematically identify various proteins that are
uniquely found in either all members, or particular subgroups, of a number of important groups of prokaryotes.
These studies have identified large number of proteins
that are specific for alpha proteobacteria [37], chlamydiae
[38], Actinobacteria [39], epsilon proteobacteria [40] and
Archaea [41]. Such genes and proteins, because of their
specificity for different phylogenetic or taxonomic groups,
provide novel means for diagnostics and evolutionary
studies [38,39,42-44] and for the discovery of important
biochemical and physiological characteristics that are
unique to these groups of prokaryotes. However, thus far
no comparative study has examined different genes/proteins that are uniquely present in species from the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi phyla or are commonly shared by

species from these two groups. In order to identify proteins that are uniquely found in the Bacteroidetes and/or
Chlorobi groups of species, we have carried out systematic
blast searches on all open reading frames in the genomes

tepidum TLS against all available sequences in the NCBI
non-redundant (nr) database. This has led to identification of large numbers of proteins that are distinctive characteristics of species from different taxonomic groups
within the Bacteroidetes phylum (e.g. specific for the
Bacteroides genus, specific for the Bacteroidales and Flavobacteriales orders, or specific for the entire Bacteroidetes
phylum). Additionally, large numbers of proteins that are
specific for the Chlorobi species as well as some proteins
that are uniquely shared by the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi
phyla have also been identified. This work also describes

three conserved indels in important housekeeping proteins (viz. alanyl-tRNA synthetase, DNA polymerase subunit III and ClpB) that are distinctive characteristics of
either the Chlorobi or the Bacteroidales-FlavobacterialesFlexebacteraceae groups. Phylogenetic analyses of the
Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi were also carried out based on a
concatenated sequence alignment for 12 highly conserved
proteins and the results of these analyses support the
inferences derived from the species distribution of various
molecular signatures.

being sequenced. The taxonomy of the Chlorobi species
has undergone significant revision in the past few years
leading to name changes and new taxonomic groupings
for a number of species [45]. The newly proposed and
former names for some of the species that will be discussed in the present work are as follows: Chlorobium tepidum changed to Chlorobaculum tepidum; Pelodictyon
luteolum changed to Chlorobium luteolum; Prosthecochloris
vibrioformis changed to Chlorobium phaeovibrioides; Pelodictyon phaeoclathratiforme changed to Chlorobium clathratiforme. Although many of these species in the databases are
still referred to by their former names, we have used the
revised nomenclature in our work to interpret the results
of evolutionary and comparative genomic studies.
Prior to undertaking comparative analyses of Bacteroidetes
and Chlorobi genomes, phylogenetic analyses on these
species were carried out to get an overview of their evolutionary relationships, which can serve as a reference point
for comparative genomic analyses. Phylogenetic analysis
of Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi species has been carried out
previously using 16S rRNA sequences and a few isolated
protein sequences [27-30,46-49]. However, recent studies
show that analyses based on larger dataset derived from
multiple genes/proteins sequences provide a more reliable phylogenetic inference [50]. Hence, phylogenetic
analyses for these species was carried out based on concatenated sequences for 12 highly conserved proteins
involved in a broad range of functions (see Methods section). The final sequence alignment for phylogenetic analysis contained a total of 6998 aligned positions.
Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbourjoining (NJ), maximum-likelihood (ML) and maximumparsimony (MP) methods [51]. The results of these analyses for the NJ and ML methods are presented in Fig. 1. The
trees were rooted using the sequences for DeinococcusThermus species. The tree in both cases consisted of two
well-resolved clades (100% bootstrap scores by both treeing methods), one comprising of various Chlorobi species
and the other containing various Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides (CFB) species. In these trees, S. ruber
appeared as a deep branching outgroup of the Chlorobi
clade, but in view of the low bootstrap score of the node
indicating this relationship and the long branch that separated them, this relationship was not reliable. The topology of various species in the MP tree was very similar,
except that in this tree S. ruber formed the outgroup of
Chlorobi as well as various other CFB group of bacteria
(results not shown). In addition to the uncertain position
of S. ruber, different species belonging to the genus Flavobacterium did not form a coherent phylogenetic group
(Fig. 1). For most other Bacteroidetes species, sequence
information for multiple species from the same genera
was not available.

sequences for Deinococcus-Thermus species and numbers on
the nodes indicate bootstrap scores in the NJ and maximumlikelihood analyses (NJ/MP). The branching position of G. forsetii, which became available after this analysis was completed, is not shown. However, our analysis of a smaller
dataset indicates that it exhibits closest affinity for the flavobacteria Psychrobacter torquis (results not shown).

Phylogenetic analysis on the concatenated dataset was
also performed employing the character compatibility
approach [52]. In this approach, all sites in the sequence
alignment where only two amino acid states are found,
with each state present in at least two species, are examined for mutual compatibility to find the largest clique of
mutually compatible characters [52-56]. By removing all
homoplasic as well as fast-evolving characters from dataset, this approach provides a powerful means for obtaining correct topology in difficult to resolve cases [56,57].
Our concatenated dataset for the 12 proteins contained
832 positions where only two amino acids were found,
with each amino acid present in a minimum of two species. The mutual compatibility of these binary state sites
was determined as described in the Methods section.
The compatibility analysis identified two largest sets of
compatible characters (referred to as cliques) each containing 410 characters. These cliques were identical in all
respects except that the relative branching positions of
Chlorobaculum tepidum and Chlorobium chlorochromatii,
which differed by a single character, were interchanged. A
composite of these cliques, in which the branching positions of these two species are not resolved, is shown in Fig.
2. A large number of characters (i.e. 200) in this clique distinguished the Chlorobi-Bacteroidetes species from the two
Deinococcus-Thermus species, which were included to serve
as outgroup. The clique is comprised of two main clades,
one consisting of various species belonging to the Bacter-

oidetes group and the other of different Chlorobi species.
The species from each of these clades were distinguished
by a large numbers of characters. In the Bacteroidetes clade,
S. ruber was found to be the deepest branching lineage and
its specific association with other Bacteroidetes species was
supported by 21 uniquely shared characters, which is a
highly significant result [57]. Additionally, the two main
orders within the Bacteroidetes viz. Bacteriodales and Flavobacteriales, for which sequence information is available
from multiple species, were clearly distinguished based
upon multiple characters. However, these analyses
detected no uniquely shared character between the C.
hutchinsonii and S. ruber. Although, these two species are
currently placed in the order Sphingobacteriales, phylogenetic trees do not support a specific grouping of them (see
Fig. 1). Different Flavobacterium species again did not
group together indicating that this genus does not constitute a phylogenetically coherent taxon. Within the Chlorobi clade, Prosthecochloris aesturaii was found to be the
deepest branching lineage, but branching order of other
Chlorobi species was not resolved.
Comparative Genomic Studies on Bacteroidetes and
Chlorobi Species
To identify proteins that are uniquely present in species
from the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi phyla at various taxonomic levels (genus and above), systematic Blastp
searches were performed on each protein or ORF in the
genomes of the following species: Bacteroides (P. gingivalis

5482 [15]); Flavobacteria (G. forsetii str. KT0803 [59]);
Chlorobi (C. luteolum DSM 273 and C. tepidum TLS [24]).
These analyses have identified a large number of proteins
that are specific for different taxonomic groups. A brief
description of these signature proteins and their evolutionary significances are discussed below.
Proteins (or ORFs) that are Specific for the Species within the
Bacteroidetes Phylum
The blast searches on various ORFs from P. gingivalis, B.
fragilis YCH46 and B. thetaiotaomicron genomes have identified 27 proteins that are present in most of the species
from the Bacteroidetes phylum (Table 2). In addition to
most fully sequenced Bacteroidetes genomes, the
homologs of these proteins are also present in most
Bacteroidetes species whose genomes have been partially
sequenced. One of these proteins, PG0448, is present in
all of the Bacteroidetes species, whose genomes have been
either partially or fully sequenced. Two other proteins,
PG1850 and PG2092, are present in all fully as well as partially sequenced genomes, except those from the Bacteroides genus. The absence of these proteins in only the
species from this genus is very likely due to selective gene
loss from this lineage and their genes also likely originated in a common ancestor of the Bacteroidetes phylum.
Similarly, four proteins viz. PG0449, PG0779, PG1679
and PG2066, are present in virtually all other Bacteroidetes
genomes, but they are missing in C. hutchinsonii. Their
absence again is very likely due to selective gene loss from
C. hutchinsonii. Eight additional proteins viz. PG0202,
PG0362, PG0399, PG0482, PG0621, PG01281, PG1367
and PG1394, are present in all other fully as well as partially sequenced Bacteroidetes genomes, but they are only
missing in S. ruber. The absence of these proteins in S.
ruber can also be explained by selective gene loss. However, in view of the fact that S. ruber branches very deeply
in comparison to all other Bacteroidetes species (Figs. 1
and 2), it is also possible that their genes evolved in a
common ancestor of the other Bacteroidetes species after
the divergence of S. ruber.

We have also come identified a 3 aa deletion in a conserved region of ClpB protease that is present in all other
Bacteroidetes species, except S. ruber (Additional file 1).
Similar to the genes for the above 8 proteins, this deletion
likely occurred in a common ancestor of the other Bacteroidetes species after the branching of S. ruber. Besides
Bacteroidetes species, this indel is also present in the ClpB
homologs from C. phaebacteroidetes (only Chlorobi species
containing this protein) and the archaeum Methanospirillum hungatei, which is likely due to LGT. The remaining
proteins in Table 2, of which 7 (BF0751, BF1057, BF1327,
BF3185; BF1254, BF3612, BF4330) are homologous to
each other, are missing in 1 or 2 sequenced species (e.g. P.
gingivalis, B. fragilis, C. hutchinsonii or S. ruber) and their

For the proteins listed here, all significant blast hits are from various Bacteroidetes species, except as noted below. These proteins are present in all
of the Bacteroidetes species listed in Table 1, except as noted in the comments.
+For the protein PG0202, a significant hit is also observed from C. phaeobacteroides; For BF0296 significant hits also observed from P. aestuarii and C.
phaeobacteroides.
Of the proteins listed here, the following proteins are homologous to each other: BF0751, BF1057, BF1327, BF3185; BF1254, BF3612, BF4330.

distribution pattern can also be explained by similar
mechanisms as discussed above. Except for a few proteins
that show limited similarity to conserved domains (CDs)
found in other proteins [60], most of the proteins in Table
2 are of unknown function.
These searches have also identified several proteins that at
present appear unique for the species from the Bacteroidales and Flavobacteriales orders. These proteins are listed
in Table 3. Of these, the first 4 proteins viz. PG0336,
PG1302, PG1537, PG2030 are present in nearly all complete as well as partially sequenced species from the above
two orders, but they are not found in S. ruber as well as C.
hutchinsonii. The latter two species, which show much

deeper branching than all other Bacteroidales species (Figs.
1 and 2), are currently placed in the order Sphingobacteriales. The genes for the proteins listed in Table 3 have thus
likely originated in a common ancestor of the Bacteroidales
and Flavobacteriales after the divergence of Sphingobacteria.
Thirty-seven additional proteins in Table 3 are also
uniquely present in either all or many of the sequenced
Bacteroidales species and a small number of flavobacteria
species including G. forsetii. A large number of these proteins are only missing in P. gingivalis, which is likely due
to gene loss. Of the proteins listed in Table 3, seven are
indicated to be conjugative transposon proteins: TraJ,
TraN, TraK, TraF, TraE and TraB (PG1251 and PG1479,
PG1475, PG1478, PG1482, PG1483 and BF0127, respec-

tively). Four of them are present in two clusters very close
to each other (PG1478-PG1479, PG1482-PG1483), supporting their involvement in related functions [61,62].
The genes for these proteins have also likely evolved in a
common ancestor of the Bacteroidales and Flavobacteriales,
followed by gene losses in various species.
Proteins that are specific for the order Bacteroidales or the genus
Bacteroides
There are 4 genomes for the Bacteroidales species (P. gingivalis W83, B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 and B. fragilis
strains: NCTC 9343 and YCH46) that have been fully
sequenced. Additionally, sequence information for a large
number of genes/proteins from Prevotella intermedia 17
and Prevotella ruminicola 23, which belong to this order is
available in the in NCBI database (see Table 1). Our blast
searches on proteins from P. gingivalis genome have identified 52 proteins that are uniquely shared by either all or
most of the sequenced Bacteriodales species and whose
homologs are not found in any other species, except

where noted (Table 4). Thirty-nine of these 52 proteins
are uniquely found in all 4 fully sequenced Bacteroidales
species. These species also form a strongly supported clade
in phylogenetic trees (Figs. 1 and 2). Thus, it is likely that
the genes for these proteins evolved in a common ancestor of this order. The remaining 13 proteins are lacking in
at least one of the Bacteroides species (noted in Table 4),
which is likely due to gene loss. In addition to the
sequenced Bacteroidales species, high scoring homologs
for many of the above proteins were also found in the two
Prevotella species. These latter homologs were detected via
genomic blasts against partially sequenced genomes from
these species (see Methods).
The majority of the Bacteroidales-specific proteins are
hypothetical and some of them are indicated as putative
exported proteins (Table 4). Some interesting proteins in
this list include the FimX proteins (PG2130, PG2168) that
are involved in fimbriae production, which is necessary
for adhesion to host surfaces [63]. Also of interest is the

All significant hits for these proteins are observed from the following Bacteroidales species, for which sequence information is available in the NCBI
or TIGR microbial sequence database. P. gingivalis W83, B. fragilis NCTC 9343, B. fragilis YCH46 , B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482, Prevotella intermedia
17, P. ruminicola 23. Unless noted below, these proteins are present in all of the above-mentioned species. Of these proteins, the following are
homologous to each other: PG0179, PG2133; PG0217, PG0218; PG0816, PG1458; PG0831, PG1442; PG2130, PG2168.

conserved hypothetical protein, PG1139, which shows
slight but significant similarity to the conserved domain
in the TlpA-like family, responsible for cytochrome maturation. One of the proteins PG0366 also had a significant
hit from C. phaeobacteroides, which could be due to LGT
[64]. There are seven proteins in Table 4 (PG0216PG0218, PG1441-PG1442, PG2130-PG2131) that are
present in clusters of two or three, suggesting that they
could form functional units. Further, a number of proteins in this table (viz. PG0179, PG2133; PG0217,
PG0218; PG0816, PG1458; PG0831, PG1442; PG2130,
PG2168) are homologous to each other, indicating that
they resulted from gene duplication events.
The Bacteroides genus contains three fully sequenced
genomes corresponding to B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482

and B. fragilis strains NCTC 9343 and YCH46. The blast
searches on B. fragilis YCH46 genome have identified 185
proteins that are mainly specific for these species (Additional file 2) and their homologs are not found in P. gingivalis. For 10 of these proteins, significant similarity was
also observed for at least one of the two Prevotella species,
suggesting that within the order Bacteriodales, species from
the Bacteroides and Prevotella genera may be more closely
related to each other in comparison to P. gingivalis. Most
of these proteins are of unknown functions, however,
some have been annotated as transmembrane or lipoproteins. Thirty-nine of these proteins are present in clusters
of two to four in the genome indicating that they could be
involved in related functions. A number of proteins in this
table are homologous to each other indicating that they
have likely resulted from gene duplication events.

Proteins that are specific for the order Flavobacteriales
The complete genome of the first flavobacteria species
viz.G. forsetii KT0803 became available very recently [59].
However, sequence information for a large number of
other Flavobacteriales species, whose genomes are being
sequenced (see Table 1), is available in the NCBI database. Our blastp and PSI-blast searches on different ORFs
in the G. forsetii genome have identified 38 proteins that
are uniquely present in virtually all of the Flavobacteriales
species (Table 5). Twenty-six of these proteins are present
in all Flavobacteriales species listed in Table 1, whereas the
remaining 12 are missing in only one of the species. An
additional group of 146 proteins are also specific for the
Flavobacteriales, but they are missing in some flavobacteria
species or limited to only a small numbers of flavobacteria
(Additional file 3). Because the genomes for most of the
Flavobacteriales species are not complete at the present
time, these proteins were not separated into different
groups.
Proteins that are unique for the Chlorobi Phylum
The genomes of three Chlorobi species viz. C. luteolum
DSM 273,C. tepidum TLS, and C. chlorochromatii CaD3,
have been fully sequenced. Our blast analyses on the C.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/71

tepidum and C. luteolum genomes have identified 51 proteins that are uniquely shared by species from this phylum
(Table 6). In addition to the 3 completely sequenced
genomes, homologs of these proteins are also present in
six others Chlorobi species (see Table 1), for which
sequence information is available in the NCBI database.
The genes for these proteins likely originated in a common ancestor of various Chlorobi species, which form a
distinct, strongly supported, clade in phylogenetic trees
(see Figures 1 and 2). The vast majority of these proteins
are of hypothetical or unknown functions. However, 5 of
them are indicated to be involved in functions related to
photosynthesis. Of these, Plut_0264 and Plut_0265 are
clustered in the genome and they correspond to chlorosome envelope proteins C and A, respectively. The protein
Plut_1500, which is indicated as bacteriochlorophyll A
protein, corresponds to the FMO protein that is involved
in the attachment of chlorosomes to the cytoplasmic
membrane [34]. The other two photosynthesis-related
proteins, Plut_0620 and Plut_1628, are annotated as photosystem P840 reaction centre protein PscD and the photosystem P840 reaction centre cytochrome c-551,
respectively [24,32]. Three additional chlorobi-specific
proteins, Plut_1714-Plut_1716, are clustered together in

the genome indicating that they may form a functional
unit [61]. There are 65 additional proteins that are also
specific for the Chlorobi species (Additional file 4). However, unlike the proteins in Table 6, these proteins are
missing in a number of the Chlorobi species and their species distribution does not show any clear pattern and
these could involve gene loss or LGTs [65]. However, the
first 8 proteins listed in this additional file (viz.
Plut_0107, Plut_0759, Plut_0762, Plut_0981, Plut_0985,
Plut_1092, Plut_1145, Plut_1858) are only found in C.
luteolum and C. phaeovibrioides. These two species form a
strongly supported clade in various phylogenetic trees
(Figs. 1 and 2) and a specific relationship between them is
further supported by the unique presence of these shared
proteins. For one of the proteins in this table, Plut_1345,
a significant hit is also observed from C. hutchinsonii,
which could be due to LGT [64,65].
In addition to the proteins that are uniquely found in various Chlorobi species, we have also identified two large
conserved inserts in two widely distributed proteins that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/71

are distinctive characteristics of the Chlorobi phylum. The
first of these signatures is a 28 aa insert in the DNA
polymerase III alpha subunit encoded by the dnaE gene
that is required for chromosomal replication in bacteria
[66]. The large insert in DnaE is present in all of the Chlorobi homologs but it is not found in any other species (Fig.
3). A smaller insert of 3–4 aa is probably also present in
this regions in some Bacteroidales species, but based on
their different sizes and sequence characteristics, these
inserts are of independent origin. The other Chlorobi-specific signature consists of a 12–14 aa insert in alanyl-tRNA
synthetase (Fig. 4), which plays an essential role in protein synthesis. This insert is again present in all Chlorobi
homologs but not found in any other species indicating
that it provides a reliable molecular marker for this group.
Proteins that are uniquely shared by the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi
species
The Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi species generally branch
very close to each other in phylogenetic trees [27-30].
However, there are very few characteristics known that are

uniquely shared by species from these two phyla. Our
analysis has identified 3 proteins (PG0081, PG0649 and
PG2432 in Table 7) that are uniquely found in virtually all
of the fully as well as partially sequenced Bacteroidetes and
Chlorobi genomes. These results are significant because
Bacteroidetes or Chlorobi species do not share any protein
in common with different species from any other group of
bacteria. Of these proteins, the protein PG0081 is also
found in Fibrobacter succinogenes. A close and specific relationship of F. succinogenes to the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi
groups was strongly suggested by our earlier work based
on conserved indels in different proteins [30]. This inference is reinforced by the unique presence of this protein

in these different groups. The absence of the protein
PG0649, which is present in all other Bacteroidetes and
Chlorobi species, in S. ruber, is probably due to gene loss.
Three other proteins, PG1818, PG1977 and BF2465
although they appear unique to the Bacteriodales and Chlorobi, their homologs are not detected in most Flavobacteria
including G. forsetii. It is likely that the genes for these proteins also evolved in a common ancestor of the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi phyla followed by gene losses in
particular Bacteroidetes lineages. All of these proteins are of
unknown functions except PG1818, which is annotated as
a putative transmembrane protein with significant similarity to the conserved domain of the ResB-like family.

Discussion
This work has identified a large number of proteins that
are specific for Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi species at various
taxonomic levels. Homologs exhibiting significant similarity to these proteins are not found in any other bacteria,
except in a few isolated cases. Among the proteins that are
specific for the Bacteroidetes, 27 proteins are specific for the
entire phylum as their homologs are present in species
from all three main orders within this phylum. Many
other proteins are limited to various clades within the
Bacteroidetes phylum. These include 41 proteins that are
common to the Flavobacteriales and Bacteroidales orders;
53 and 38 proteins that are specific for the Bacteriodales
and Flavobacteriales orders, respectively; and 185 proteins
that are specific for the Bacteriodes genus. We have also
identified 51 proteins that are specific for the Chlorobi species and 6 proteins that are uniquely shared by the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi phyla. Two large conserved inserts in
the DnaE and AlaRS proteins that are distinctive characteristics of the Chlorobi species were also discovered in this
work. In addition, a deletion in ClpB protein that is

mainly specific for the Bacteriodales, Flavobacteriales and
Flexibacteraceae was also identified. In earlier work, a
number of conserved inserts that are specific for either the
Bacteroidetes phylum (viz. SecA and Gyrase B) or commonly shared by the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi species
were also described. Based upon their specificity for the
Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi species, these molecular markers
provide novel and more definitive means for identifying
and circumscribing species from these groups.
The species distribution patterns of these signature proteins and conserved indels strongly suggest that they or
the genes for them have evolved at various stages in the
evolution of these bacteria (Fig. 5). However, subsequent
to their evolution or introduction in these genes, these
genomic characteristics are stably retained in various
descendents of these lineages with minimal gene loss or
LGTs, as has also been found in other related studies [3741,44,67,68]. The evolutionary relationship among the
Bacteroidetes species as deduced from these signature proteins is in complete agreement with their branching pat-

All significant blast hits for these proteins are from the indicated (marked by *) Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi species. For the protein PG0081, a
homolog is also present in Fibrobacter succinogenes subsp. succinogenes S85 (identified by blast search against the partial sequence). The blank space

tern in phylogenetic trees (Figs. 1 and 2). The unique
presence of several signature proteins as well as conserved
indels in a number of essential proteins (viz. FtsK, UvrB
and ATP synthase alpha subunit) by different Bacteroidetes
and Chlorobi species provides compelling evidence that
species from these two groups shared a common ancestor
exclusive of all other bacteria. In earlier studies, a close
relationship of Fiborbacteres to the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi was also observed [2,30]. The species from all these
three groups were found to contain large conserved indels
in RNA polymerase β ' subunit and serine hydroxymethyl
transferase, that were not found in any other bacteria [30].
The species from these three groups also branched in the
same position based on distribution profiles of signature
sequences in a number of other proteins and in different
phylogenetic trees [30,69]. The unique shared presence of
the protein PG0081 by all sequenced Chlorobi and Bacteroidetes species as well as Fibrobacter succinogenes, provides

further evidence that species from these three groups form
a single superphylum and that they shared a common
ancestor exclusive of all other bacteria [30].
This paper also reports phylogenetic analyses of Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi species based on a concatenated alignment of 12 highly conserved proteins. The branching
order of various species in the trees obtained using different phylogenetic methods were in general very similar
with the clades corresponding to the Chlorobi species and
the Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides species, well
resolved from each other with 100% bootstrap scores. The
species corresponding to the two main groups within the
Bacteroidetes phylum (viz. the Bacteriodales and Flavobacteriales orders) were also clearly resolved. However, in the
trees constructed by traditional phylogenetic methods
such as NJ, ML and MP, the phylogenetic placement of S.
ruber was not resolved. In all of these trees, S. ruber

appeared either as a very deep branch of the Chlorobi clade
(i.e. in NJ and ML trees) or as outgroup of both the Chlorobi and the CFB clades (MP tree). In contrast to these
trees, when the same dataset was analyzed by means of
the character compatibility or clique approach, S. ruber
formed the deepest branch of the Bacteroidetes species and
its specific association with this group was supported by
21 uniquely shared characters, indicating strongly that
this affiliation was reliable [57]. These results provide evidence that the character compatibility approach, which
removes all fast-evolving as well as homoplasic sites from
a given dataset, provides a powerful means for obtaining
correct topology in cases, such as that for S. ruber, whose
phyletic affinity has proven difficult to establish by traditional phylogenetic methods [13,52,56,57].
The cellular functions of most of the Bacteroidetes or Chlorobi-specific proteins identified in the present work are not
known. A few of the Chlorobi-specific proteins are
involved in chlorosome- or photosynthesis-related functions, which is expected as Chlorobi is one of the few bacteria phyla that possesses photosynthetic ability
[22,31,32,34,70]. A number of other proteins exhibit
weak sequence similarity to conserved domains in certain
other proteins, but considering that the overall sequence
similarity is not significant, the actual functions of these
proteins could be quite different. Therefore, an important
task for the future is to determine the cellular functions of
these Bacteroidetes or Chlorobi specific proteins. Likewise, it
is also of much interest to determine the functional signif-

icance of the conserved indels in SecA, Gyrase B and ClpB
proteins that are distinctive characteristics of the Bacteroidetes [30], and of the inserts in DnaE and AlaRS proteins
that are specific for the Chlorobi species. The retention of
these signature proteins and conserved indels by all species from these groups strongly suggests that they are functionally important for these bacteria. Hence, further
studies on these molecular signatures should lead to the
discovery of novel biochemical and physiological characteristics that are unique to these bacteria. The primary
sequences of many of these genes/proteins that are specific for the Bacteroidetes or Chlorobi species are highly conserved and they provide novel means for identification of
both known as well as novel species belonging to these
groups by means of PCR-based and immunological methods. Several Bacteroidetes species play central role in the
initiation and progression of periodontal diseases in
humans [12,18,19,58]. Hence, the proteins that are specific to these bacteria also provide important potential targets for development of therapeutics and vaccines for
treatment and prevention of periodontal diseases.

Methods
Identification of Proteins that are Specific for
Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi
The blastp searches were carried out on each ORF in the
genomes of P. gingivalis W83 [58], B. fragilis YCH46 [35],
B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 [15], G. forsetii KT080 [59],
Chlorobium (Pelodictyon)luteolum DSM 273 and C. tepidum
TLS [24], to identify proteins that are specific for the
Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi phyla at different taxonomic levels. The blastp searches were performed against all organisms (i.e. using the NCBI non-redundant (nr) database)
with default settings except that the low complexity filter
was not used [71]. The proteins that were of interest were
those where either all significant hits were from these
groups of species or which involved a large increase in E
values from the last Bacteroidetes-Chlorobi hit to the first hit
from any other organism and the E values for the latter
hits in most cases > 10-4, which indicates a weak similarity
that could occur by chance. However, higher E values were
sometimes acceptable particularly for smaller proteins as
the magnitude of the E value depends upon the length of
the query sequence. All promising proteins were further
analyzed using the position-specific iterated (PSI)-blast
program [71]. This program creates a position-specific
scoring matrix from statistically significant alignments
produced by the blastp program and then searches the
database using this matrix. The PSI-blast is more sensitive
in identifying weak but biologically relevant sequence
similarity as compared to the blastp program [71]. In the
present work, a protein was considered to be specific for a
given group if all hits producing significant alignments
were from that group of species. However, we have also
retained a few proteins where 1 or 2 isolated species from

Page 14 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:71

other groups of bacteria also had acceptable E values, as
they provide possible cases of lateral gene transfer. For all
of the Bacteroidetes or Chlorobi-specific proteins identified
in the present work, their protein ID's, accession numbers
and any information regarding cellular functions (such as
COG number or the presence of any conserved domain)
are presented here. Preliminary sequence information
regarding the presence of a homolog of a query protein in
the partially sequenced genomes of P. intermedia, P.
ruminicola and F. succinogenes subsp. succinogenes S85 were
obtained via genomic blasts against The Institute for
Genomic Research database for unfinished microbial
genomes [72]. In describing various proteins in the text,
"PG," "BF," "BT," "orf", "Plut" and "CT" indicate the identification numbers of the proteins in the genomes of P.
gingivalis W83, B. fragilis YCH46, B. thetaiotaomicron VPI5482,G. forsetii KT080, C. (Pelodictyon) luteolum DSM and
C. tepidum TLS, respectively.
Phylogenetic Analysis
The amino acid sequences for the 12 conserved proteins
viz. RNA polymerase β subunit, RNA polymerase β ' subunit (RpoC), alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS), arginyltRNA synthetase, phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, elongation factor-Tu, elongation factor G, RecA protein, DNA
gyrase subunit A, DNA gyrase subunit B, Hsp60 or GroEL
protein and DnaK or Hsp70 protein, for different species
were downloaded from the NCBI database and aligned
using the ClustalX (1.83) program using the default settings [73]. The sequences for two deep-branching species,
D. radiodurans and T. aquaticus [27], were included in this
dataset for rooting purposes. The sequence alignments for
all 12 proteins were concatenated into a single large alignment containing 8899 positions. Poorly aligned regions
from this alignment were removed with the Gblocks
0.91b program [74], using the default settings, except that
allowable gap position was selected to half. This resulted
in a final sequence alignment of 6998 sites, which was
used for phylogenetic analyses. A NJ tree based on this
alignment (bootstrapped 1000 time) was constructed
based on Kimura's model [75] using the TREECON programs [76]. Maximum-likelihood and MP trees were computed using the WAG+F model plus a gamma distribution
with four categories [77] using the TREE-PUZZLE [78] and
Mega 3.1 program [79], respectively. All trees were bootstrapped 100 times [80], unless otherwise indicated.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/71

were converted into a binary file of "0, 1" characters using
the DUALSITE program and this file was used for compatibility analysis [57]. The compatibility analysis was carried out using the CLIQUE program from the PHYLIP
(ver. 3.5c) program package [81] to identify the largest
clique(s) of compatible characters. The cliques were
drawn and the numbers of characters that distinguished
different nodes were indicated. The sequence information
for G. forsetii, which became available after these analyses
were completed [59] is not included in these trees.
Identification of conserved indels
Multiple sequence alignments for large numbers of proteins have been created in our earlier work [82-84]. These
alignments were visually inspected to search for any
indels in a conserved region that was uniquely present in
C. tepidum (the only Chlorobi species present in these
groups). The specificity of any potential indel for these
groups was evaluated by carrying out by blastp searches
on a short segment of the sequence (between 80–120 aa)
containing the indel and the flanking conserved regions
against the nr database. The purpose of these blast
searches was to obtain information from all available
homologs to determine the specificities of the indels.

Authors' contributions
The initial blastp searches on various genomes were carried out by RSG with the computer assistance provided by
Venus Wong. EL analyzed the results of these blast
searches to identify various group-specific proteins and
confirmed their specificities by means of PSI-blast and
genomic blasts. RSG carried out the phylogenetic analyses
and identified the conserved indels described here. RSG
was also responsible for conceiving and directing this
study and for the final evaluation of results. RSG was
responsible for the preparation of the final manuscript.
All authors have read and approved the submitted manuscript.

The character compatibility analysis on the concatenated
alignment was carried out as described recently [57].
Using the program "DUALSITE" [57], all sites in the alignments where only two amino acid states were found, with
each state present in at least two species, were selected. All
columns with any gaps were omitted. The sites where one
of the states is present in only a single species are not useful for compatibility analysis. All useful two state sites
