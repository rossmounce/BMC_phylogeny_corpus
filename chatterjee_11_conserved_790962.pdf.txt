Conserved and non-conserved enhancers direct
tissue specific transcription in ancient germ layer
specific developmental control genes
Sumantra Chatterjee1,2, Guillaume Bourque3 and Thomas Lufkin1,2*

Abstract
Background: Identifying DNA sequences (enhancers) that direct the precise spatial and temporal expression of
developmental control genes remains a significant challenge in the annotation of vertebrate genomes. Locating
these sequences, which in many cases lie at a great distance from the transcription start site, has been a major
obstacle in deciphering gene regulation. Coupling of comparative genomics with functional validation to locate
such regulatory elements has been a successful method in locating many such regulatory elements. But most of
these studies looked either at a single gene only or the whole genome without focusing on any particular process.
The pressing need is to integrate the tools of comparative genomics with knowledge of developmental biology to
validate enhancers for developmental transcription factors in greater detail
Results: Our results show that near four different genes (nkx3.2, pax9, otx1b and foxa2) in zebrafish, only 20-30% of
highly conserved DNA sequences can act as developmental enhancers irrespective of the tissue the gene
expresses in. We find that some genes also have multiple conserved enhancers expressing in the same tissue at
the same or different time points in development. We also located non-conserved enhancers for two of the genes
(pax9 and otx1b). Our modified Bacterial artificial chromosome (BACs) studies for these 4 genes revealed that many
of these enhancers work in a synergistic fashion, which cannot be captured by individual DNA constructs and are
not conserved at the sequence level. Our detailed biochemical and transgenic analysis revealed Foxa1 binds to the
otx1b non-conserved enhancer to direct its activity in forebrain and otic vesicle of zebrafish at 24 hpf.
Conclusion: Our results clearly indicate that high level of functional conservation of genes is not necessarily
associated with sequence conservation of its regulatory elements. Moreover certain non conserved DNA elements
might have role in gene regulation. The need is to bring together multiple approaches to bear upon individual
genes to decipher all its regulatory elements.

Background
One of the paradigms of development is the regulation
of the genome in a precise and synchronized manner to
form a highly complex embryo with diverse and specialized cell types. Though the major cell types in the
embryo contain the same genetic material, they are very
different from each other in both morphology as well as
function. The generation of this cellular diversity by the
genome is controlled by cis-regulatory elements. Cis-regulatory elements are DNA elements that are a key

component of the genome’s non-coding functional
sequences and consist of promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators and locus control regions (LCR). The
idea that animal development is regulated by cis-regulatory DNA elements is well established and has been elegantly described in invertebrates [1-3]. Of the many cisregulatory elements, enhancers are critical in modulating
tissue specific and time dependent gene expression during embryonic development [4-7]. Enhancers are
thought to consist of clustered target sites for a number
of transcription factors and collectively form the genomic instructions for developmental gene regulatory networks. Hence any approach to elucidate such networks

necessitates the discovery of all constituent enhancer
elements and their genomic locations.
The identification and characterization of such cis-regulatory regions within the non-coding region of vertebrate genomes remains a challenge for the post
genomics era. Traditionally enhancers have been identified through deletion assays [8,9] and in vitro footprinting [10,11]. But recent advances in sequencing coupled
with improved alignment tools have made comparative
genomics one of the favored methods for enhancer
detection [12-15].
It is suggested that 1% of the human non-coding genome is at least 70% conserved in the mouse genome
over a region of 100 bp or longer [16,17]. Many such
conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) lie next to critical developmental control genes and have been shown
to be developmental enhancers when selected and tested
in mice and zebrafish [14,18,19]. It has also been
demonstrated that genomic regions that have no
sequence level conservation among different species can
act as robust developmental enhancers [13,20]. Recently
chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massive
sequencing (ChIP-Seq) for P300 and ChIP followed by
microarray (ChIP-Chip) on histone modifying mark
H3K4me3 (Histone 3 Lysine 4 trimethylation) has been
shown to be useful in identifying tissue specific enhancers on a global scale, many of which have very weak
sequence conservation [21-24]. Though such studies are
a valuable resource they are limited by both the amount
of material generated from a particular tissue as well as
the availability of a specific antibody. It is also interesting to note that all enhancers are not marked by specific
histone marks or co-activator proteins.
Our study takes a “gene centric” approach to locate
and validate CNEs as transcriptional enhancers, thus
helping to link an enhancer to gene expression and
helping to understand transcriptional control of specific genes in greater depth. We looked for CNEs to validate as enhancers around four critical developmental
control genes that are expressed in tissues that are
ancient in origin and conserved in evolution. We
sought to investigate if genes, irrespective of which
germ layer they expressed in, followed the general
trend of having both sequence conserved and non-conserved enhancers or if there was a bias depending on
the germ layer. We picked one gene expressing in
ectoderm (otx1b), one expressing in endoderm (foxa2)
and two from mesoderm (nkx3.2 and pax9). As mesoderm is considered to be of more recent origin [25,26],
we chose 2 genes expressing in this particular germ
layer to assess whether there was any bias in enhancer
conservation due to evolutionary time. We hypothesized that using stringent conservation criteria over
large phylogenetic distances will lead to a better

filtering out of the functional enhancers from nonfunctional CNEs.
Using modified Bacterial artificial chromosomes
(BACs) to detect regulatory elements is highly beneficial
when testing for multiple regulatory domains from noncontiguous DNA, which act in concert to regulate
expression of a gene [27,28]. It has also helped in cases
where when the non-coding regulatory DNA is not conserved across species and thus not recognizable prior to
testing. The success of this approach lies in fact that for
genes with multiple expression domains, most of these
domains can be observed in a single transgenic embryo
as opposed to screening for multiple embryos for individual DNA constructs. Hence, we also modified the
BACs containing the 4 genes of interest to locate and
validate cis-regulatory elements, which are not conserved at the sequence level.

Results
nkx3.2

Bagpipe related homeobox containing genes are members of the ancient NK gene family and are highly conserved in sequence and function from Drosophila to
humans. In mammals it restricts the multipotential
mesodermal progenitor to a chondroblast lineage and
helps in the development and evolution of the axial skeleton in mouse and has potential role in human skeletal
disorders [29-32]. It also has a known role in jaw joint
formation and patterning [31,32]. nkx3.2 has also been
detected in the dorsal and anal fin radials of zebrafish as
late as 10 dpf and in the distal chondrocytes [33]. We
detected nkx3.2 expression by RNA in situ in the sclerotome and parts of anterior branchial arches at 24 and
48 hpf (Figure 1B, C).
CNEs in and around nkx3.2

UCSC genome browser’s alignment of sequences near
Nkx3.2 in zebrafish revealed four conserved elements
around the gene matching our criterion (≥ 100 bp
length, ≥ 60% conservation) named Bx1 to Bx4 and varied in length from 318 to 990 bp (Figure 1A and Additional File 1). These pieces were co-injected with the
minimal promoter-EGFP construct into 1-cell zebrafish
embryos and observed for EGFP expression in the
domains of expression of nkx3.2 in zebrafish at different
time points. Only one DNA element, Bx4 drove EGFP
expression that was detected along the antero-posterior
axis in the region of the emerging sclerotome and myotome at 48 hpf (Figure 1D and Additional File 2).
Because transient transgenics in zebrafish tend to produce mosaic expression we did immunohistochemistry
with an EGFP antibody to detect the exact expression
domain of this enhancer as previously described [34].

revealed the expression of the enhancer matched that of
the endogenous gene (Additional File 3). There was no
EGFP expression from the remaining CNEs at the developmental time points under observation. For this gene
we also cloned all the four enhancer elements upstream
of the promoter in the same order as they are found in
the genome and this “mega” construct was also tested.
We did not see any significant increase in expression
level or domain from all the four enhancers versus only
the single functional CNE (data not shown). Thus only
1 out of the 4 CNEs functioned as a developmental
enhancer at all time points under observation.
nkx3.2 BAC modification

A 186 kb BAC (CH73-353E16) containing the zebrafish
nkx3.2gene was identified from the UCSC genome
browser and modified by inserting the EGFP ORF and a
selection cassette was inserted just upstream of the
translational start site of the gene (Additional File 4).

This ensured that the all the cis-regulatory elements in
the 186 kb genomic region around Nkx3.2 that was
cloned into the BAC were captured in the assay. This
modified BAC was injected into 1-cell zebrafish embryos
and the embryos were followed over its development to
detect EGFP in domains of expression of nkx3.2. 70% of
the embryos gave distinct expression along the anteroposterior axis as marked by sclerotome/myotome, at 24
and 48 hpf (Figure 1E), which correlated with the nkx3.2
expression as detected by the RNA in situ (Figure 1C,
D). We were however unable to detect any EGFP
expression in the branchial arch, which is also a domain
of expression for the gene. This led us to conclude that
the regulatory elements for this domain lay outside the
186 kb genomic DNA present in the BAC.
pax9

pax9 is a member of the paired box (PAX) family of
transcription factors. Members of this gene family

Chatterjee et al. BMC Developmental Biology 2011, 11:63
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/11/63

typically contain a paired box domain, an octapeptide,
and a paired-type homeodomain. The paired domain
consisting of 125-128 amino acids, encoded by the
paired box, was named after the Drosophila pair-rule
segmentation gene paired (prd) where it was first identified. There are nine known Pax genes in mouse (Pax1
to Pax9) and also humans (PAX1 to PAX9). Except
Pax4 all other Pax genes also are present in zebrafish.
In teleost fish there is evidence to suggest that Pax9 is
indispensable for the development of the sclerotome
and the neural arch [35]. Zebrafish pax9 expression is
initiated at the end of the segmentation period in
mesenchymal sclerotome cells on both sides of the
notochord. Our RNA in situ hybridization detected
expression of pax9 in the dorsal sclerotome and parts of
branchial arches at 36 hpf (Figure 2B) and at 48 hpf
(Figure 2C)
CNEs in and around pax9

Alignment of the sequences around pax9 revealed 11
conserved elements matching our criteria ranging in size
from 311 bp to 1.2 kb (Figure 2A and Additional File 1)

until there was a synteny break in one or both species
that were used in the alignment. Six of these pieces
were at the 5’ end of the gene while five were from the
3’ end, with the furthest being 178 kb away. Three out
of these CNEs faithfully recaptured EGFP expression
along the A-P axis as marked by the sclerotome/myotome when co-injected with the minimal promoterreporter construct. All the three CNEs drove expression
of EGFP along the presumptive sclerotome and myotome at different time points in development. Elements
Px2 and Px4 which were 23 and 27 kb away from the
gene on the 5’ end drove expression in the sclerotome
and myotome at 36 hpf (Figure 2D, E and Additional
File 2), whereas Px7 which was 17 kb away from the
gene at the 3’ end drove EGFP expression in the same
domain at 48 hpf (Figure 2F and Additional File 2).
Thus 27% of the CNEs around pax9 were functional in
our assay for enhancers.
Since all the three functional CNEs were expressing in
the cells along the antero-posterior axis which contain
both the sclerotome and myotome, we did immunohistochemistry for EGFP as described previously on the

enhancers were active in. Ours results show that all the
three enhancers are expressing in the subset of sclerotomal cells which also expresses pax9 as seen by RNA in
situ hybridization. (Additional File 5)

injected into 1-cell zebrafish embryo and followed over
development. The modified BAC recapitulated the gene
expression data in the sclerotome and myotome at 24 to 48
hpf. 70% of the embryos at 48 hpf reproduced this expression pattern in dorsal sclerotome consistently (Figure 2G).

Branchial Arch enhancer of pax9

otx1b

Since pax9 expresses in the branchial arch and none of the
CNEs around pax9 could recapitulate the expression data,
we decided to locate the enhancer by testing the whole 15
kb genomic region lying between the last exon of pax9
and the functional enhancer Px7. We decided on testing
the region on the 3’end of the pax9 gene, as the 5’ end is
gene rich containing nkx2.9 and nkx2.1b in close proximity. The 3’ end only had one gene slc25a21, which had
introns containing large stretches of non-coding DNA,
and also contained one of the enhancer for pax9 (Px7).
We did overlapping PCRs of about 500 bp each to narrow
down the enhancer to a 564 bp region (chr17:47,920,93647,921,499) (Figure 3A and Additional File 1) that could
robustly drive activity in the branchial arch at 36 hpf. (Figure 3B, C). This region does not show sequence conservation even with closely related fish species.

Orthodenticle homolog 1 is a vertebrate homolog of the
Drosophila orthodenticle and encodes a member of the
bicoid sub-family of homeodomain containing transcription factors. Otx1 along with Otx2 has been implicated
in the regional patterning of the rostral head and both
are synergistic in function in certain domains of the
brain. The Otx1 gene has been strongly associated with
the formation of the otic vesicle in gnathostomes starting with the teleost fish and hence helping in transition
from the jawless vertebrates to a more gnathostome
characteristics [36] and also in determining cerebellar
cell identities in zebrafish [37]. Our RNA in situ hybridization detected expression of otx1b in neural plate at 6
hpf (Figure 4B) and forebrain, midbrain and otic vesicle
at 48 hpf (Figure 4C)

with the farthest being 172 kb away. There was no synteny at the 3’ end of the gene with mouse and human
genomes. Ox4 strongly recapitulated the gene expression at 6 hpf at the neural plate (Figure 4E and Additional File 2). Both Ox2 and Ox3 that are adjacent to
each other and about 8-10 kb away from the gene drove
EGFP expression in the forebrain at 48 hpf (Figure 4F,
G and Additional File 2). We did not detect any EGFP
expression from the other CNEs when they were
assayed individually with the reporter construct. Thus
19% of the conserved elements assayed in our system
were positive as tissue specific enhancers.
otx1b BAC modification

The 111 kb BAC (CH73-220O18) containing the Otx1
gene was modified with a reporter and was injected

into the 1-cell fertilized zebrafish embryos as previously described. The EGFP expression could be
detected as early as 6 hpf in the neural plate (data not
shown). An individual CNE also drove reporter gene
expression in the same tissue at the same time point
and was present in the genomic region cloned in the
BAC under testing. 69% of the injected embryos also
showed EGFP expression in the forebrain midbrain
and otic vesicle at 48 hpf, which overlapped with the
endogenous gene expressions at the time point
observed by RNA in situ (Figure 4D). We detected a
much more extensive expression domain for the BAC
as compared to the individual CNEs, thus leading us
to believe that there exist more regulatory elements in
that genomic region than detected by sequence level
constrain.

foxa2

foxa2 is a member of the forkhead transcription factor
family and is specifically expressed in the visceral endoderm, anterior definitive endoderm, node, notochord
and floorplate [38-40]. In zebrafish it has been shown
that although foxa2 is not required for the induction of

Page 7 of 16

the floorplate, it is required for its further differentiation
and for induction and/or patterning of several distinct
cell types in the ventral CNS [41]. Our RNA in situ
hybridization detected expression of foxa2 along the
forebrain and the pharyngeal endoderm at 48 hpf (Figure 5B-D).

CNEs in and around foxa2

Using our criteria, we located six CNEs around Foxa2,
all of which were located at the 3’ end of the gene, the
closest being 2 kb away and the farthest being 60 kb
away and ranging in size from 425 bp to 1220 bp (Figure 5A and Additional File 1). Each of these CNEs was
individually ligated with the reporter construct and the
injected embryos were visualized at different time points
in development. Two of the CNEs, Fx2 and Fx6 could
drive expression in the forebrain at 48 hpf (Figure 5G,
H and Additional File 2). There was no detectable
expression of EGFP from the other individual CNEs at
the time points under observation. So only 33% of the
CNEs assayed were functional as developmental enhancers in zebrafish.
foxa2 BAC modification

The 179 kb BAC (CH211-38M14) containing the genomic insert in and around zebrafish foxa2 was modified
and injected into 1-cell zebrafish embryos. The BAC
recapitulated the endogenous gene expression particularly in the rostral end of the embryo in the forebrain
and pharyngeal endoderm at 48 hpf (Figure 5E-F). We
failed to detect EGFP expression in any other foxa2
expression domains.
Bac dissection to detect non-conserved enhancers

Since many of the CNEs failed to act as enhancers
coupled with the fact that our data on pax9 as well as
previous studies reported the presence of non-conserved
enhancers [20] we sought to investigate in a detailed
manner if we could locate more such functional nonconserved enhancers. Since most of our modified BACs
gave us expressions that were more extensive than the
individual CNEs alone, we employed the traditional
method of BAC dissection. We selected the otx1b BAC
for these experiments as the modified BAC for this gene
had shown a robust spatio-temporal expression, recapitulating substantial domains of expression of the endogenous gene (Figure 6E). The BAC was digested with
the restriction enzyme XbaI, which generated 22 fragments ranging from 48 bp to 27 kb in size (Figure 6A).
The fragments were individually ligated to the minimal
reporter construct and injected into 1-cell zebrafish
embryo. Three fragments gave EGFP expression in the
fore and/or mid brain of the zebrafish embryo at 24 and
48 hours. Two of the positive fragments each contained
a functional CNE in them (Ox2 and Ox3). The third
fragment, a 6.4 kb piece from the 3’ end
(chr17:20,307,773-20,314,262) of zebrafish Otx1b gene
mapped to a large region that included introns and
exons of a predicted gene (Ensembl Transcript:
ENSDART00000090374). Also this fragment was conserved in among the fishes-Fugu and Tetraodon. This

Page 8 of 16

element was functional in our assay expressing in forebrain and otic vesicle (Figure 6F). The fact that it
mapped to such a large region that included exons led
us to believe that the core element might be smaller.
This 6.4 kb (NC) regulatory element was further
reduced into five overlapping 1050 bp and one 1500 bp
fragment by PCR (Figure 6B). The overlapping PCR
fragments ensured we did not have abrupt breakpoints
in the DNA fragments. These six fragments (NC1-NC6)
were individually tested by co-injection with the minimal reporter construct into zebrafish embryos and one
(NC2) of the 1050 bp fragments (chr17:20,312,33320,313,342) partially recapitulated the expression
domain of the bigger 6.4 kb fragment at 24 and 48 hpf
(Figure 6G). There was no expression from the other 5
fragments. NC2 showed partial conservation to the tetraodon and fugu genome. NC2 was further reduced to
five (NC2A-NC2E) 210 bp fragments by doing overlapping PCRs and each piece was individually injected with
a reporter construct (Figure 6C). Fragment NC2C
(chr17:20,312,743-20,312,952) on its own could drive
expression of EGFP reporter in a subset of the expression domain of NC2 (Figure 6H), which was a subset of
the expression domain of the 6.4 kb fragment in the
forebrain and otic vesicle. Interestingly the NC2C 210
bp fragment had no conservation with any species in
the genome alignment. Thus we concluded that this element was a zebrafish specific enhancer for otx1b. We
also observed that reducing the size of the DNA
resulted in a slight reduction both in the domain of
expression as well as the level of expression in the
embryo. One possible reason for this reduction in
expression domain was that, although the small 210 bp
fragment contained most of the transcription factor
binding sites essential for its function, it was missing
some other binding sites which were in the neighboring
fragments and the extensive expression domain as seen
by the 6.4 kb fragment is result of the synergistic activity
of multiple transcription factors interacting with the regulatory element.
Biochemical and transgenic assays to detect a core
binding site

Seven overlapping Cy5 labeled DNA probes were
designed to span the 210 bp Otx1b non-conserved
enhancer (NC2C) (Figure 6D). The probes were incubated with nuclear extract from 24 hpf zebrafish
embryos and run on a native gel (EMSAs). Two out of
the seven fragments showed a distinct shift indicating
that they contained sites for transcription factor binding
(Figure 7A). Both of these fragments were co-injected
with the EGFP reporter construct into 1-cell zebrafish
embryos. One of the fragments (EM4) could drive EGFP
expression to the rostral portion of the brain,

recapitulating a subset of the expression domain of the
bigger 200 bp fragment (Figure 7D). The other fragment
(EM6) that bound protein in vitro did not show any
activity in vivo.
We made “sliding” 5 bp mutations (nucleotide transversions e.g. A to C) along the 40 bp (EM4) region to
narrow down the binding site (Additional File 6). Mutations in nucleotide 21 to 25 (GGAGG) completely abrogated binding of the protein with weakened binding
observed for mutations in nucleotides 26-30(GAGGG)
(Figure 7B). Injection of the EGFP reporter construct
harboring the mutant 5 bp binding sites independently
in the zebrafish showed weakened EGFP expression but
not complete loss of activity (Figure 7E, F). This led us

to believe that the nucleotide 21-30 together harbored
the functional site in the enhancer. We went ahead and
designed mutant probes for the whole 10 bp (21-30
nucleotides) region and EMSA and transgenic assays
showed a complete abrogation of binding and markedly
reduced EGFP expression in the zebrafish embryos (Figure 7C, G). This gave conclusive proof that the actual
binding site and the core functional domain of the nonconserved enhancer lay within these 10 nucleotides.
Enhancer binding transcription factor

We used the TRANSFAC database (http://www.generegulation.com/index.html) [42] to find potential transcription factors (TFs) that could bind to the 10 bp

Chatterjee et al. BMC Developmental Biology 2011, 11:63
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/11/63

sequence in our non-conserved enhancer. By using a
criterion of entire matrix similarity > 0.75 we came up
with a list of 3 putative transcription factors that could
bind the sequence: Foxa1, Pbx2, and Lef1 (Additional
File 6). We performed supershift assays with antibodies
against the potential TFs and saw a supershift uniquely
with the Foxa1 antibody (Figure 8A). To conclusively
prove that Foxa1 was critical for the functioning of the
enhancer we designed 2 morpholinos against Foxa1 and
co-injected the morpholinos with the 40 bp non-conserved enhancer construct. Whereas the scrambled morpholino (Figure 8C) did not have any effect on the
enhancer and recapitulated the expression of the enhancer alone (Figure 8B), knocking down Foxa1 resulted in
a dramatic reduction of the enhancer activity by both
the morpholinos (Figure 8D, E). To verify if Foxa1 was

indeed knocked down in the morphants, we did western
blots, as previously described [34], to detect proteins
levels of Foxa1. The western blots indicated that both
the morpholinos used against Foxa1 resulted in dramatic
decrease in levels of Foxa1, which were not seen in the
scrambled morpholino control (Additional File 7 Figure
A). To test if downregulation of Foxa1 and decreased
activity of the otx1b enhancer actually led to a dramatic
drop in expression of otx1b we did RT-PCR on RNA
extracted from both wild type as well as morphant
embryos at 24 hpf (Additional File 7 Figure B) as well as
RNA in situ for otx1b in both these embryos (Additional
File 7 Figure C). There was no discernable expression
change detected by PCR or in situ, strongly suggesting
that the expression of otx1b at 24 hpf is also controlled
by other functional enhancers thus the abrogation of
activity of one regulatory element does not lead to significant drop in its expression. Hence our data suggests
that Foxa1 is important in driving the activity of otx1b
in the forebrain and otic vesicle in zebrafish via a redundant enhancer which is not conserved at the sequence
level.

Discussion
This study focused on examining CNEs directing
expression of four developmental control genes that are
ancient in origin and conserved during evolution and
expressed in the three different germ layers. This
allowed us to ask two very important questions regarding the nature and role of these conserved elements: (1)
are all the conserved elements found in the syntenic
region around a gene functional? (2) Can we find all the
enhancers for a particular gene by looking only at the
CNEs? The CNEs selected for our study were selected
based on a criteria of ≥ 60% sequence identity and ≥
100 bp in length across three phylogenetically distant
species (human, mouse, zebrafish). As the teleost fishes
and mammals last shared a common ancestor about 450
million years ago, predating the emergence of the
majority of all extant vertebrates, it strongly implied that
any non-coding sequences conserved between these two
groups are likely to be fundamental to vertebrate life
and hence functional. The design of our study has also
allowed us to address some major arguments which
have been put forward before to explain the absence of
functionality in these CNEs in human-mouse comparative studies. By being able to look at potentially all
developmental time points we had an advantage over
most of the studies where the functional testing was
done in mouse and was restricted to one developmental
time point [14]. Yet our data clearly indicates that even
DNA elements that are conserved very stringently over
long evolutionary time might not have functional roles
as enhancers during development. The fact that many of

Chatterjee et al. BMC Developmental Biology 2011, 11:63
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/11/63

these conserved non-coding elements are non-functional
as enhancers and non-conserved DNA can be functional
is not totally unexpected. Previous studies [9,20] by
other groups looking at single genes also revealed similar trends in other genomic loci in the zebrafish. Conversely it has also been shown that absence of sequence
level homology does not preclude a fragment of DNA
from being functional as a developmental enhancer
[13,43]. Thus our data supports the hypothesis that in
zebrafish many of the enhancers for important developmental control genes are not constrained at the
sequence level.
We have also demonstrated that there is still a need to
combine high throughput comparative genomics with
detailed biochemical assays to locate and validate cisregulatory elements in the vertebrate genome. By doing
such detailed assays on one of the non-conserved
enhancers we have demonstrated that putative transcription factor binding sites and the actual transcription factor binding to an enhancer can be determined with
great accuracy and can lead to a more complete analysis
of an enhancer. Though a recent study discovered
motifs in zebrafish enhancers, they only predicted what
putative transcription factors could bind them [44], we
went beyond only prediction and actually validated the
responsible transcription factor. We believe our study
will help in opening the door for future studies looking
in finer detail at individual enhancers and how they control gene expression.
We have also shown the utility and efficiency of using
BAC transgenics in zebrafish to locate and validate distal
cis-regulatory elements for different genes. BACs have
been successfully used to validate cis-regulatory elements for numerous genes in mouse [28,45] and in certain cases multiple overlapping BACs have been used to
locate all the regulatory elements of a gene [27]. BAC
modification for transgenics has also been employed for
a few zebrafish genes in the past [46-49]. We have done
an extensive spatio-temporal gene expression study of
BAC transgenics for four critical developmental control
genes. Thus we have demonstrated that circular modified BACs can be used without linearization for largescale transgenic studies in zebrafish making it an attractive model system for similar future studies.
Finally it has not escaped our attention that only
about 20-30% of the CNEs tested were functional as
developmental enhancers. Most of these fragments
could indeed be non-functional but alternately other
possible explanations exist. One possibility is that these
elements are acting in a synergistic manner and require
other elements together to function. This was also
demonstrated by our BAC studies, which show much
more extensive expression patterns as compared to the
individual CNEs. Also the possibility exists that these

Page 12 of 16

CNEs could be negative regulatory elements and hence
our assay fails to capture this activity. Some recent
results from other groups have indicated the same for
the human genome [15]. Also other functions such as
chromatin attachment sites, miRNA genes or splice regulatory regions may also reside in such highly conserved
non-coding sequences [50-54].

Conclusions
Thus it is becoming increasing clear that the degree of
sequence conservation is not a measure of how ‘important’ or ‘crucial’ a functional element might be, but its
relevance is shaped by the underlying molecular
mechanisms that determine its particular function.
Hence as we demonstrated here, future needs will be to
combine evolutionary, functional and bioinformatic
approaches to understand how these sequences function
at the molecular level to determine the nature of these
interactions and finally decipher what 98% of our genome encodes.
Methods
RNA in situ hybridization

DNA clones for making in situ hybridization probes
were obtained from the Expressed Sequence Tag (EST)
clone collection at the Genome Institute of Singapore
and whole mount in situ hybridization using digoxigenin
(Roche) labeled RNA probes was performed as described
previously [55]
Fish maintenance and embryo staging

Fish were maintained in the GIS zebrafish facility
according to standard procedures. Crosses were set up
in the evening and the barrier was lifted the next morning. After half an hour, the fertilized embryos were collected and maintained at 28.5°C in egg water
supplemented with methylene blue. The stages of
embryos were indicated as hpf (hours post-fertilization)
or dpf (days post-fertilization) [56]. From 24 hours
onward the embryos were raised in egg water containing
Phenylthiourea. This helps to prevent pigmentation and
allows better visualization of the Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) signal. The GFP2 filter of stereomicroscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany) was used to
observe the EGFP signals in transgenic zebrafish. The
Leica DFC camera was used to take photographs and
was captured using the IM50 software from Leica.
Genome alignments and Conserved Non-coding Elements
(CNEs)

The University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome
browser’s (http://genome.ucsc.edu) zebrafish (Danio
rerio) Zv6 genome assembly was used as a base genome
to align the genome sequences with mouse (mm8

Chatterjee et al. BMC Developmental Biology 2011, 11:63
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/11/63

assembly) and human (hg18 assembly) for regions
around genes of interest. This assembly was used initially as the comparative genomics tracks were best annotated. Aligning the sequences with a recent assembly
(Zv8) has shown that all the CNEs tested have still
remained conserved and non-coding in the new annotation. For the positive CNEs the new coordinates from
the Zv8 assembly are listed in Additional File 1. The
closest gene to the start of each CNE was determined
by the looking at known gene annotations on the UCSC
genome browser. The UCSC browser’s conservation
tracks (phastcon conserved elements) were used to
determine conserved elements (≥ 60% identity, ≥ 100 bp
length). Transcribed sequences in the conserved set
were filtered out using known genes, spliced ESTs and
mRNA annotations (intronic conservation was allowed).
We confined our search for CNEs up to 1 Mb or till
wherever there was a break in synteny around the gene
of interest between the three species (zebrafish-mousehuman).

Page 13 of 16

Three independent injections were done for all constructs (Additional File 2).
For locating the pax9 non-conserved branchial arch
enhancer, we did 500 bp overlapping PCRs spanning the
15 kb genomic region (chr17:47,911,703-47,927,438)
from the final exon of pax9 to the functional CNE Px7
which is located in the third intron of the neighboring
gene slc25a21. Each fragment was ligated to the reporter
construct individually tested. We did not PCR out the
three exons of the slc25a21. The embryos were observed
at various time points in development (from 6 hpf to 3
dfp) for GFP expression. On basis of the GFP expression
a CNE was scored as 1) positive, 2) negative or 3) positive but not in “expected” domain of the gene. The
domains of expression were annotated by referring to
the RNA in situ hybridization results for the gene and
also by cross-referring to existing gene expression data
at ZFIN (The Zebrafish Model Organism Database)
(http://www.zfin.org).
BAC targeting construct and modification

Functional Assays

We assayed for enhancer activity in embryos by either
co-injecting the candidate enhancer element with a
minimal promoter-reporter vector in a method previously described [19,57] or by ligating individual CNEs
to the minimal vector. Though there has been suggestions that using transposon based vectors might be a
more efficient way to assay for enhancers, our previous
study and also studies from other labs have shown that
circular vectors containing the enhancer-reporter construct as well as co-injection of the reporter construct
with the DNA are equally efficient in transient transgenic assays in zebrafish [34,58]. In a series of control
experiments we injected just the reporter construct
alone (negative control), which was found to be transcriptionally inactive on its own. For preparation of
DNA for microinjections, CNEs were PCR amplified
from zebrafish genomic DNA or bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) containing the region of interest (50100 bp sequences immediately flanking the core conserved region on either side was included in the PCR).
DNA was purified using the QIAquick PCR purification
kit (Qiagen, USA). The minimal vector was constructed
by cloning in the EGFP ORF (Clontech, USA) under the
control of a minimal promoter from the mouse b-globin
gene. This fragment was released from the vector backbone using SmaI restriction enzyme and gel purified
using QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, USA). Element DNA (at 20-50 pg/μl), reporter fragment (50 pg/
μl) and phenol red (0.1% as tracer) were combined and
injected into at least 200 1-cell zebrafish embryos using
a Pico-Injector (PLI-100 Harvard Instrument, USA).

The UCSC genome browser was used to locate 150-250
kb BACs containing the gene of interest. A BAC was
selected which contained sufficient flanking genomic
sequences around the gene. This enabled us to retain
the regulatory elements in their proper genomic context
and hence increase the possibility of capturing the maximum number of distal cis-regulatory elements. A BAC
targeting vector was constructed by PCR amplifying a
FRT-PGK-gb2-NEO-FRT cassette from a commercially
available vector (Gene Bridges, GmbH). This was cloned
into the NotI site of a pBlueScript vector SK+ (Stratagene, USA) containing the EGFP ORF between its XhoINotI sites. This fragment containing the EGFP ORF and
selection cassette was PCR amplified with 50 bp homology arms on either side of the translational start site of
each gene of interest and homologously recombined
using the GeneBridges BAC modification kit (Gene
Bridges, GmbH) as per the manufacturer’s instructions
(Additional File 4) [59]. Circular modified BAC DNA
was purified using Qiagen Maxiprep kit and injected
into one-cell zebrafish embryo and EGFP expression followed over development.
BAC dissection

The otx1b BAC was digested with XbaI restriction
enzyme and the fragments generated were co-injected
with the reporter vector into embryos. The fragments
that drove EGFP expression were mapped back to the
zebrafish genome assembly to determine its position
with respect to the otx1b gene. The 6.4 kb non-conserved fragment was further subdivided into 1 kb and
200 bp fragments by generating overlapping PCRs. The

expression of EGFP was used in subsequent EMSAs.

Plc) was applied in 1:500 dilution, followed by anti
mouse IgG at 1:2500 dilution.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs)

RT-PCR

Nuclear proteins were extracted from 24 hpf zebrafish
embryos using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic
extraction kit (Thermo Scientific, USA). EMSAs were
carried out using DNA probes modified with 5’ Cy5
labels (Sigma Proligo). The 200 bp non-conserved functional element was sub divided into six 40 bp and one
30 bp overlapping fragments having a 10 bp overlap.
Equimolar amounts of complementary strands were
mixed and heated to 95°C followed by gradual cooling
to ambient temperature over at least 5 h to anneal the
probes. For binding studies, double-stranded DNA
probes at 10 nM were mixed with 10 ug of nuclear proteins and 500 ng of Poly dI-dC (Sigma) in a buffer containing 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.4 mg/ml BSA, 200
uM ZnCl2 , 400 mM KCl, 40% glycerol and 0.4% IGEPAL and incubated at 4°C in the dark for one hour. The
bound and unbound probes were subsequently run on a
pre-run 8% 1X TBE polyacrylamide gel for approximately 30 min at 200 V. The fluorescence was detected
using a Typhoon 9140 PhosphorImager (Amersham
Biosciences). At least three independent experiments for
each binding site were performed to ascertain binding.
Mutation studies on the 40 bp genomic DNA fragment (EM4) that showed a shift was carried out by
sequentially mutating 5 and 10 bases each along the
sequence by transversion and carrying out EMSA on
each mutant probe. For supershift experiments, 10 ug of
24 hpf zebrafish nuclear extract was incubated with 10
nM EM4 probe and 1 ug of antibody against the three
predicted transcription factors (FOXA1: ab23738, PBX2:
ab 66942, LEF1: ab 52017, all from Abcam plc), incubated for 1 hour and run on a gel as described above.

Total RNA was extracted from wild type and morphant
24 hpf zebrafish using TRIzol (Invitrogen, USA) as per
manufacture’s instruction. Reverse transcription was
performed using Superscript III (Invitogen, USA) and
oligo DT primers. PCR was performed on the cDNA
using the primers 5’-AATCTCCATCCGTCTACATT-3’
and 5’-CAGGCCGTTCATGGCGTAGG-3’ for otx1b
and 5’-CGGTGACATCAAGGAGCT-3’ and 5’TCGTGGATACCGCAAGATTCC-3’ for b-actin.
