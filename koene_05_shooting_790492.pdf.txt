Abstract
Background: Evolutionary conflicts of interest between the sexes often lead to co-evolutionary
arms races consisting of repeated arisal of traits advantageous for one sex but harmful to the other
sex, and counter-adaptations by the latter. In hermaphrodites, these antagonistic interactions are
at least an equally important driving force. Here, we investigate the evolution of one of the most
striking examples of sexual conflict in hermaphrodites, the so-called shooting of love-darts in land
snails. Stabbing this calcareous dart through the partner's skin ultimately increases paternity. This
trait is obviously beneficial for the shooter, but it manipulates sperm storage in the receiver. Hence,
an arms race between the love-dart and the spermatophore receiving organs may be expected.
Results: We performed a detailed phylogenetic analysis of 28S ribosomal RNA gene sequences
from dart-possessing land snail species. Both the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test and Bayesian posterior
probabilities rejected a monophyletic origin of most reproductive structures, including the lovedart, indicating that most traits arose repeatedly. Based on the inferred phylogenetic trees, we
calculated phylogenetically independent contrasts for the different reproductive traits. Subsequent
principal component and correlation analyses demonstrated that these contrasts covary, meaning
that correlated evolution of these traits occurred.
Conclusion: Our study represents the first comprehensive comparative analysis of reproductive
organ characteristics in simultaneous hermaphrodites. Moreover, it strongly suggests that coevolutionary arms races can result from sexual conflict in these organisms and play a key role in
the evolution of hermaphroditic mating systems.

Background
Evolutionary conflicts of interest between the sexes have
been convincingly demonstrated in species with separate
sexes [1]. These sexual conflicts often give rise to traits that
are advantageous for one sex but harmful to the other. If

these detrimental effects are counteracted, a co-evolutionary arms race may ensue in which harmful traits and corresponding counter-adaptations arise repeatedly [2]. Such
antagonistic interactions can bring about major changes
in the mating behaviour, genital morphology, gametes

and seminal products, potentially leading to speciation
[2]. Similar arms races seem to occur in hermaphrodites,
contrary to Darwin's conviction [3] that sexual selection
cannot act in hermaphroditic organisms. In fact, theoretical modeling indicates that these processes can become
even more extreme in hermaphroditic species (N.K.
Michiels and J.M. Koene, unpublished data), mainly
because within one mating simultaneous hermaphrodites
gain paternity (male fitness) which can outweigh the loss
in female fitness. Here we investigate the evolution of a
most peculiar reproductive behaviour that occurs in
simultaneously hermaphroditic land snails (Stylommatophora), the "shooting" of a so-called love-dart into the
mating partner.
Several explanations have been offered for the evolution
of the enigmatic dart shooting behaviour. The dart is
made of calcium carbonate and has therefore been proposed to serve as a nuptial gift of calcium for the production of eggs [4,5]. However, in Cantareus aspersus
(previously Helix aspersa) the dart does not contain
enough calcium to significantly contribute to egg production and darts are only rarely incorporated by the recipient
[6]. Likewise, in other investigated species darts are even
retained by shooters to be reused on the next mate [[7,8],
J.M. Koene and S. Chiba, unpublished data). Therefore
two other hypotheses have been put forward. In the
female choice hypothesis the dart represents a sexual signal and recipients select on dart shooting effectiveness
[5,9]. The important prediction of this hypothesis is that
this can only be beneficial for the recipient if the dart is
shot consistently by individuals (assuming that shooting
ability is heritable). Tests in C. aspersus do not support
this, because dart shooting of individually-identified animals in consecutive matings is unpredictable (G-test: N =
29 snails, df = 1, G = 6.745, P < 0.01; J.M. Koene, unpublished data). Besides, in Arianta arbustorum dart shooting
seems to be an optional component of courtship [10].
In the last hypothesis, the dart is used to manipulate the
mating partner and can thus cause a sexual conflict [11].
This latter hypothesis seems most consistent with findings
in the common garden snail C. aspersus, the species in
which dart shooting and copulatory behaviour has been
extensively studied. During courtship, the stylophore
(dart sac) is everted and the single calcareous dart is
pierced into the partner. Both mating partners normally
shoot a dart before their penises are simultaneously intromitted. During intromission, spermatophores are
exchanged and transferred into the partner's receiving
organ, either directly into the bursa copulatrix or in an
associated diverticulum (Figure 1). To avoid digestion in
the spermatophore receiving organ (SRO), sperm have to
actively swim out via the spermatophore's tail (formed by
the flagellum of the penis) into the vaginal duct to reach

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/25

the sperm storage site (the spermathecae) [12]. Previous
work on C. aspersus has demonstrated that the shooting of
the love-dart serves to introduce an allohormone [13-15],
produced by associated glands, into the blood of the partner [16]. This allohormone inhibits digestion of sperm
[17], which results in more of the donated sperm reaching
the spermathecae [18] and fertilizing eggs [19,20]. This
manipulation of the sperm storage process caused by darts
can have a negative effect on the recipient's (reproductive)
fitness because of interference with cryptic female choice.
Interestingly, love-darts display an astonishing diversity
between species, both in number and shape, ranging from
several simple cone-shapes to one elaborately bladed
structures [21,22]. The most elaborate darts show surface
enlargement with blades that is likely to enhance the
transfer of gland product. We therefore predict that dart
elaboration should covary with allohormone production,
which should be mirrored in the gland morphology as
surface enlargement. Moreover, the dart specializations
that enhance gland product transfer are potentially more
successful at manipulating fertilization. If so, adaptations
to counteract this effect are expected, which could give rise
to a co-evolutionary arms race. These predictions are
tested here using a comparative analysis of dart-possessing land snail species. Note that we are only focussing on
the Helicoidea superfamily; we do not include species
with non-homologous dart-like structures (see also [22]).
Because the phylogeny of land snails is heavily based on
reproductive morphology [23,24], we first reconstructed
an independent phylogeny based on part of the 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene [25]. Our findings represent the
first comprehensive comparative analysis of reproductive
organ characteristics in simultaneously hermaphroditic
animals and are consistent with co-evolution and counter-adaptation predicted by sexual conflict theory.

Results
Reproductive organ morphologies
Within the land snails that possess love-darts, there is a
large diversity in reproductive structures and the darts
themselves provide an impressive range of shapes. There
are species with one dart, while others have several or
none. Darts of some species have a simple cone-shape,
whereas others show surface enlargement with blades.
Additionally, darts vary from straight to curved and contorted. This variety in dart shapes is illustrated in the electron microscopic photographs in Figure 2 and the line
drawings in Figure 3. We found similar levels of variation
between species in the other reproductive organs. These
differences include the number, relative size and placement of both functional and vestigial stylophores; the
number, relative size, type of branching, and placement of
the glands; the presence, relative length and placement of

identical topologies. The only differences consisted of the
exact position of Fruticicola fruticum within the Bradybaenidae, of Leptaxis erubescens within the Hygromiidae, the
relationship of the four major lineages of the Helicidae,
and the position of Cernuella cisalpina, C. hydruntina, C.
virgata, and Xerosecta cespitum in relation to each other.
Moreover, although BI produced high support values for
a much larger number of clades than ML bootstrapping,
the clades with high ML bootstrap scores also always had
high BI posterior probabilities (Figure 3). Furthermore,
the four main families were all correctly identified (Figure
3). The only exception being that Polymita picta was not
grouped with the other species of the Helminthoglyptidae. However, this taxon is found at the end of a comparatively long branch. Hence, its position at the base of the
superfamily Helicoidea could be due to long branch
attraction to the outgroup and may therefore be
unreliable.

diverticulum. The love-dart (D) is produced and stored in
the stylophore (S, often called dart sac) and shot by a forceful
eversion of this organ. The mucus glands (MG) produce the
mucus that is deposited on the dart before shooting. The
penis (P) is intromitted to transfer the spermatophore. The
sperm container is formed in the epiphallus (EP), while the
spermatophore's tail is formed by the flagellum (FL). When a
bursa tract diverticulum (BTD) is present, the spermatophore is received in this organ. Together with the bursa tract
(BT) and bursa copulatrix (BC) these form the spermatophore-receiving organ (SRO, indicated in grey), which digest
sperm and spermatophores. Sperm swim out via the tail of
the spermatophore to enter the female tract and reach the
sperm storage organ (SP, spermathecae) within the fertilization pouch (FP)-spermathecal complex. Other abbreviations:

length of the flagellum.
Phylogenetic analysis
Both ML and BI yielded a single optimal phylogenetic tree
(see Figure 3 for the BI tree). These two trees had almost

Both the SH test and BI posterior probabilities indicate a
multiple origin of most reproductive organ characteristics
(Table 1). Namely, a single origin was always rejected by
BI posterior probabilities except for the presence of the
diverticulum when monophyly was assumed within each
of the four main families (Helicidae, Bradybaenidae,
Helminthoglyptidae, Hygromiidae). The SH test did not
confirm a single origin of the number of blades on the
darts, the number of stylophores and glands, and the
shape of glands if monophyly was assumed across all land
snails. However, when monophyly was only hypothesized to occur within the four main families, then the SH
test only rejected it for the stylophore number and the
shape of the glands.
Principal component and correlation analysis
The overall PCA (Table 2) that was performed on the BI
dataset revealed that most PICs loaded positively and significantly on the first PC axis (at P < 0.15 or P < 0.05 (see
[26])) and explained 32.5% of the total variance. This
result suggests that the traits all covary. To examine this
correlated evolutionary pattern in more detail we performed separate PCAs on the data for darts, stylophores,
glands, and spermatophore receiving organs (Additional
file 1) followed by a correlation analysis. These PCAs permitted for successful reduction of the variable number per
trait to two PCs. For each organ the first two PCs explained
over 70% of the variation for each trait, regardless of the
tree used for PIC calculation (Additional file 1). The interpretation of the PCs can be deduced from the inferred
eigenvectors (Additional file 1) and is mentioned between
brackets in the following description of the results from
the correlation analyses.

The correlation analyses in Table 3 shows the relationships between the PCs for the different traits based on the

BI tree without phylogenetic uncertainty. Significant correlations indicate co-evolution between organs. The correlations in Figure 4 are also based on the BI tree without
phylogenetic uncertainty, but essentially identical results
were obtained for the PICs calculated from the other phylogenetic trees as well as the raw data (Additional file 2).
Additionally, we only show results for the PCAs based on
all the variables; the results were essentially identical
when only the significantly loading variables were
included (data not shown). Most importantly, there are
significantly positive correlations between Dart PC1 (dart
shape) and Gland PC1 (gland complexity) (Figure 4A);
Dart PC2 (dart number) and Stylo. PC1 (vestigial stylophores); Gland PC1 (gland complexity) and Stylo. PC1 as
well as Stylo. PC2 (functional stylophores) (Figure 4B).
Additionally, there is a significantly negative correlation

between Gland PC2 (gland shape) and Stylo PC1 (vestigial stylophores). Furthermore, the SRO PC1 (SRO complexity) shows significant positive correlations with Dart
PC1 (dart shape) and Gland PC1 (gland complexity) (Figure 4C). Finally, we also found that the length of the flagellum of the penis (which forms the spermatophore's tail)
positively correlates with SRO PC1 (Figure 4D) as well as
with Gland PC1 (gland complexity).
One potential problem of this detailed analysis is that our
character coding may produce a bias in the data when
organs are absent, because then the organ itself as well as
all related traits are scored as zero. However, this does not
have a strong effect on the analysis of darts, stylophores,
glands and flagellum, where there are only very few taxa
in which the respective organ is absent. The diverticulum

Discussion
Sexual conflict can cause counter-adaptive co-evolution
between male and female reproductive organs. Although
such conflicts may become costly, when looking at only
one species these costs usually remain hidden because the
mating partners are well adapted to each other [27,28].
Therefore, an inter-species comparison is required to reliably reveal patterns of counter-adaptive co-evolution
driven by sexual conflict [29]. The results from our
detailed comparative analysis are indeed most consistent
with the presence of a co-evolutionary arms race in simultaneous hermaphrodites, which has generated a diversity
of dart shapes and reproductive organ morphologies. This
finding corroborates the theoretical prediction that sexual
conflict and counter-adaptation can play a major role in
the evolution of hermaphroditic mating systems and
reproductive morphologies [30,31].
In detail, our findings provide evidence for both repeated
and correlated evolution between traits associated with
dart shooting and spermatophore receipt. The occurrence

of both is considered convincing evidence for a co-evolutionary arms race. The reconstructed phylogenies that we
used to test this, were estimated from the 28S rRNA gene
with different tree reconstruction methods (see Methods).
In agreement with previous studies [32-34], ML bootstrap
values for the inferred clades are generally smaller than
the BI posterior probabilities. Hence, BI support for the
inferred clades may be overestimated. Although BI is
considered to provide a highly consistent framework for
phylogenetic inference, its reliability under different
evolutionary scenarios and the interpretation of clade
posterior probabilities is still under debate [32-34]. Nevertheless, in our study ML and BI produced highly similar
trees. In addition, the results are consistent with morphology-based trees, for example all families form monophyletic groups except for the Helminthoglyptidae
[23,24]. Hence, the consistency of results obtained with
different methods and between molecular and morphology-based phylogenies suggests that the inferred phylogeny is generally robust.
Even though small discrepancies existed between the
inferred phylogenies, they did not seem to have a large
effect on the subsequent analyses (PCA and correlation
analysis). These analyses produced consistent results
regardless of the underlying topology or the consideration

the total variance in the data set (respectively, 32.5%, 19.3%, 9.6%, and 9.0 %). Tests of significance of variable loadings represent frequency of

the consideration of phylogenies with a limited number

of uncertainties still yields considerably more reliable

Both the SH test and BI posterior probabilities reject a single origin of most reproductive structures when monophyly is assumed across all land snails, as was already
suggested for the dart by Tompa [36]. When monophyly
is assumed within each of the well-supported families
(Helicidae,
Bradybaenidae,
Helminthoglyptidae,
Hygromiidae) monophyly is still rejected in some cases
but with less significance (Table 1). Because BI tends to
overestimate reliability of inferred clades (i.e. very high

posterior probabilities), it automatically underestimates
support for clades, which are not represented in the
inferred tree. In this case, hypotheses of their monophyly
would be often incorrectly rejected. This could be the reason for our finding that BI posterior probabilities for the
specific hypotheses of monophyly were almost always
highly significant, even when the SH test statistics were
clearly insignificant. Nonetheless, taken together the
results strongly indicate that we are dealing with repeated

evolution of most characteristics of the reproductive
system.
Using phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs), to
account for phylogenetic affiliation of the taxa [37], we
found clear evidence for correlated evolution. Namely, the
overall principal component analysis demonstrates that
correlated evolution across the PICs occurs on one co-evolutionary axis, meaning that the traits covary [26].
Examination of this pattern in more detail revealed that
when darts become more elaborate the number of stylophores (and thus the number of darts, as previously suggested [21,22]) decreases and the complexity of the glands
increases (Figure 4A,B). These co-evolutionary patterns
lead us to conclude that the changes enhance the transfer
of gland product and possibly improve sperm storage,
provided that the gland products of the investigated species have similar effects as those seen in C. aspersus
[17,19,18,20].
If inhibition of sperm digestion occurs, it will ultimately
influence sperm storage and thus fertilization success
[17,19,18,20], which is beneficial for the shooter and
hence favoured by sexual selection. However, the
receiver's fertilization processes are manipulated by the
mucus while the dart itself causes damage and may
increase infection risk. Consequently, counter-measures
can be expected. Behavioural counter-adaptations to prevent dart receipt seem unlikely because the tactile information from contact with the partner's skin, which cannot
be avoided during mating, is essential for dart shooting to
occur [38]. Conversely, physiological or morphological
counter-adaptations are possible, e.g. changes in allohormone receptor sensitivity, skin thickness, or female reproductive morphology. Here, we report morphological
counter-adaptations in the spermatophore receiving
organs (Figure 4C). The adaptations primarily entail the
appearance and subsequent lengthening of a diverticulum. These changes increase the distance sperm need to
travel to the spermathecae, presumably this hampering of
sperm storage occurs to offset the increased sperm survival
caused by the more elaborate darts and glands.
The latter change poses an additional complication
because sperm are most successful at reaching the storage
site when the spermatophore's tail is protruding into the
vaginal duct [12]. The tail of the spermatophore is formed
by the flagellum of the penis, which we used as a measure
of the tail's length. The significant correlations of the flagellum (spermatophore's tail) with both the SRO and
gland complexity can therefore also be interpreted as an
indication of counter-adaptation.
The presented study provides a first step into understanding the diversity of love-darts in land snails and clearly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/25

raises several questions for future studies. For example,
the previously available experimental data strongly suggest that dart shooting serves to manipulate the partner
(manipulation- or sexual conflict hypothesis), whereas
alternative hypotheses are not supported (nuptial giftand female choice hypothesis; see background section).
Although the manipulation hypothesis is entirely consistent with the results of the current study, it implies that
dart shooting benefits the shooter, as previously demonstrated [13-20], and that it also negatively affects the
receiver, for which no direct evidence is available yet.
Hence, an important challenge for the future is to evaluate
the possible costs of receiving a dart. In this context, our
results also allow to choose closely related species with
pronounced differences in dart morphology (e.g. C. hortensis and C. nemoralis) for a more detailed experimental
study addressing the causes and consequences of reproductive organ diversity. The examination of variation
among closely related species pairs and/or within species
may additionally provide novel insights into the
dynamics of the co-evolutionary adaptations. Finally, evidence is accumulating that not all species use their dart in
the same way. Hence, additional behavioural data are pivotal for a full understanding of the evolution of these
darts.

Conclusion
We found support for both repeated and correlated evolution, which we consider compelling evidence for a co-evolutionary arms race. Furthermore, because empirical
findings are most consistent with the manipulation
hypothesis, we conclude that the observed co-evolutionary patterns result from a sexual conflict. This comparative
study is the first of its kind in simultaneous hermaphrodites. The results strongly suggest that sexually antagonistic co-evolutionary interactions can play an equally
important role in hermaphrodites as they do in organisms
with separate sexes [29,39]. As such, sexually antagonistic
co-evolution may provide an important driving force for
the evolution of hermaphroditic mating systems and possibly even speciation. Moreover, it may also account for
some of the other bizarre reproductive structures and
behaviours found in hermaphrodites like gigantic penises
[40] and penis biting [41] in land slugs, hypodermic
insemination in tropical flatworms [42], and body piercing in earthworms [43].

Methods
Snails material
We obtained data from 51 land snail species from the four
main dart-possessing families: the Helicidae, the
Hygromiidae, the Helminthoglyptidae, and the Bradybaenidae. We also included one member of both the Polygyridae and Camaenidae, plus three outgroup taxa.
Mature specimens of the species were collected by JMK or

provided by colleagues (Additional file 3). Prior to fixation in 80% EtOH the animals were relaxed by drowning,
which was also the standard protocol for specimens
obtained from the malacological collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. In three cases,
where we could not obtain snail material ourselves, we
used previously published information on reproductive
organ morphology [44] and DNA sequence data [25]
(Additional file 3). In 21 other cases, because previously
published DNA sequence data were already available [25],
we only obtained data on reproductive organ characteristics (Additional file 1).
Reproductive organ morphologies
We examined five different reproductive structures: darts,
stylophores, glands, spermatophore receiving organs, and
the flagellum of the penis (Figure 1). For this, adult specimens of each species were dissected to remove the reproductive tract. Subsequently, the reproductive organs were
drawn using a camera lucida. These drawings were used to
determine relative organ sizes, thus correcting for body
size (see Additional file 4). The albumen gland, which is
seasonally variable because it provisions the eggs, was not
included when determining relative sizes. Only adult animals from one location with fully formed darts were
included. To avoid damage of the darts, the stylophores
were carefully cut out of the reproductive tracts and placed
overnight in 1N NaOH, which dissolved all the tissue and
mucus but left the dart intact. For cross-sections, darts
were carefully broken in two. The intact and broken darts
were consecutively prepared for electron microscopy by
placing them on small aluminium plates with an electrically conducting adhesive (Leit-Tab, Plano). They were
then coated with gold using a Metalloplan (Leitz). The
darts were placed under a scanning electron microscope
(S-530 SEM, Hitachi) and photos were taken. The characteristics of the reproductive structures were scored as ranks
in order of complexity, based on the traditional taxonomic literature (e.g. [24]) (Additional file 4).
Molecular data
The phylogeny of the snails was examined using an analysis of the 5' end of the 28S rRNA gene. DNA was isolated
from snails using a CTAB-based protocol [45]. In detail,
snail tissue was ground up with a pestle in 400 µl CTAB
buffer (2% (w/v) Cetyl-trimethyl-ammonium-bromid,
0.1 M Tris-HCL pH 8.0, 0.02 M EDTA, 1.4 M NaCl, 0.2%
(v/v) β-Mercaptoethanol). Tissue was further digested by
addition of 4 µl Proteinase K (10 mg/ml) and incubation
at 50°C overnight. DNA was extracted by addition of 2
volumes chloroform:isoamylalcohol (24:1) and centrifugation at 13.000 rotations per minute (rpm) for 15 min.
The DNA containing supernatant was recovered and DNA
was precipitated by addition of 2/3 volumes of 100% isopropanol, incubation of the mixture at -20°C for 1 h, and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/25

subsequent centrifugation at 13.000 rpm for 30 min. The
DNA pellet was finally washed in 70% ethanol, left to dry
and resuspended in 50–100 µl sterile Millipore H2O. The
5' end of the 28S rRNA gene was amplified via PCR, using
primers designed in conserved regions of the ribosomal
cistron of molluscs (Additional file 5). Amplification was
performed under standard reaction conditions: 1 U Taq
Polymerase (Promega Ltd.), 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl
pH 9.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of
each dNTP, 0.5 µM of each Primer. The following cycling
profile was used: 5 min at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of
20 sec at 95°C, 30 sec at 62.5°C and 1 min at 70°C, and
a final extension period of 10 min at 70°C. PCR products
were purified using Microcon-50 microconcentrators
(Millipore Ltd). DNA sequencing was subsequently performed with the reverse PCR primer and additional internal primers (Additional file 5), using the ABI Prism
BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems Ltd) and visualization of results on an ABI310
Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems Ltd). All sequences
are deposited at the EMBL database under accession numbers AJ550953 to AJ550982.
Phylogenetic tree reconstruction
The DNA sequence alignment (EMBL: ALIGN_000524)
was produced with CLUSTALW, using default settings
[46], and was subsequently adjusted by eye in cases of
obvious errors (e.g. large end gaps) using the program
BIOEDIT, version 5.0.9 [47]. The alignment contained 51
taxa and 740 positions, of which 169 were variable
(22.84%). All phylogenetic analyses were based on either
conventional maximum likelihood (ML) as implemented
in the program PAUP*, version 4, beta 10 [48] or Bayesian
inference (BI) as implemented in the program MRBAYES,
version 2.01 [49]. Both methods permit specification of
substitution models to correct for multiple hits and provide a consistent statistical framework for hypothesis testing [50,51]. The Tamura-Nei substitution model with
gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity across sites and a
proportion of invariable sites (TN-Γ-I) was found to be
optimal for the data with the help of likelihood ratio tests
following the procedure outlined by Huelsenbeck and
Crandall [52] and using the program MODELTEST, version 3.06 [53]. The TN-Γ-I model was employed for all
subsequent ML analysis. Since the program MRBAYES currently does not support TN-Γ-I, BI was based on the next
more complex model available, the general time reversible substitution model with rate heterogeneity across sites
(GTR-Γ).

For ML tree estimation, parameters of the substitution
model were first optimized using a maximum parsimony
(MP) tree, inferred with a heuristic search via branchswapping by tree bisection and reconnection (TBR). These
parameter estimates were then employed in the ML tree

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:25

search, using the heuristic search options and the MP tree
as a starting topology for branch-swapping by TBR [for a
similar approach, see [45]]. Nodal support was inferred
via non-parametric bootstrapping [45] using the same ML
settings and 200 replicate data sets. Specific hypotheses on
the origin of reproductive organ characteristics were
assessed with the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test [55].
For these tests, trees were first calculated with specified
topological constraints, which each represented one of the
hypotheses of interest. Tree calculation was again based
on ML and the above settings. Thereafter, trees with topological constraints were compared with the optimal topology using the SH test statistics, inferred with the RELL
bootstrap option, as implemented in PAUP* (see [56]).
BI was based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
approach, using 500,000 generations, four chains (one
cold and three heated), each started with a random tree,
and saving of trees every 10 generations. Stationarity was
reached after 40,000 generations. Calculation of
consensus trees and summary statistics was thus based on
trees obtained from only subsequent generations. BI was
performed twice, using the same settings, and produced
qualitatively identical results (identical tree topology,
highly similar branch lengths and nodal support values)
(see [49]). The monophyletic origin of reproductive organ
characteristics was evaluated with the help of the inferred
posterior probability of the respective clades [57].
Independent contrast and principal component analysis
The taxa included are related to each other at different
degrees. Hence, the data obtained for reproductive organ
characteristics are not independent, resulting in increased
type I errors in comparisons between taxa [37,58,59]. To
correct for phylogenetic affinity, we calculated phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs) using CONTRAST
3.6 [37]. We treated variables as continuous since the
scores for each of them were ranked in order of complexity (for similar approaches see [60,61]). PICs were
inferred from four tree topologies: the BI and the ML tree,
both either with or without consideration of five cases of
phylogenetic uncertainty. These cases refer to differences
between BI and ML trees, which also lack support from BI
posterior probabilities and ML bootstrapping. Because
these differences are characterized by short branches, phylogenetic uncertainty was taken into account by setting
branches to zero. This essentially produces hard polytomies, which is equivalent to a very rapid radiation rate
(see [59] for a similar approach). Adequate standardization of contrasts was confirmed by plotting the absolute
values of contrasts against their standard deviations [62].
Note that we decided against the approach of Pagel [63],
as implemented in the program CAIC [64], to take
account of phylogenetic uncertainty. This method relies

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/25

on the a-priori specification of a predictor variable, which
is not applicable for our data set.
To assess the main pattern of evolutionary covariance of
the traits, we first performed a single principle component
analysis (PCA) on all the PICs from the BI tree without
phylogenetic uncertainty. Significance of variable loadings was tested by determining the frequency of loadings
different in sign to the ones observed, among 1000 bootstrap replicate analyses (generated with SYSTAT 10.2) corrected for axis reversals [26]. We then also examined
correlated evolution among pairwise compared traits, in
order to obtain more fine-scale information about the coevolutionary pattern. For this, we first used PCA to reduce
the number of related PIC variables that jointly characterize a specific trait. Thus, separate principal components
(PC) were created for the dart, stylophores, glands, and
SRO. For each of these organs the PCs, which explained
over 70% of the variance, were compared in a correlation
analysis. PCA and correlation analysis was applied to the
raw data and to PICs resulting from the four trees (see
above), using the program JMP 4.0.2 (SAS Institute Inc.).

Authors' contributions
All the snail material and reproductive organ morphologies were collected and/or obtained by JMK. The molecular data collection was performed by JMK, while HS did
the phylogenetic tree reconstruction and monophyly testing. HS also provided the independent contrasts, that
were used by JMK in the principal component and correlation analyses. JMK and HS wrote the paper.
