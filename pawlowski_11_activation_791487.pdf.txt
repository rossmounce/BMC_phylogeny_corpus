Abstract
Background: The interferon-inducible immunity-related GTPases (IRG proteins/p47 GTPases) are a distinctive family
of GTPases that function as powerful cell-autonomous resistance factors. The IRG protein, Irga6 (IIGP1), participates
in the disruption of the vacuolar membrane surrounding the intracellular parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, through
which it communicates with its cellular hosts. Some aspects of the protein’s behaviour have suggested a dynaminlike molecular mode of action, in that the energy released by GTP hydrolysis is transduced into mechanical work
that results in deformation and ultimately rupture of the vacuolar membrane.
Results: Irga6 forms GTP-dependent oligomers in vitro and thereby activates hydrolysis of the GTP substrate. In this
study we define the catalytic G-domain interface by mutagenesis and present a structural model, of how GTP
hydrolysis is activated in Irga6 complexes, based on the substrate-twinning reaction mechanism of the signal
recognition particle (SRP) and its receptor (SRa). In conformity with this model, we show that the bound
nucleotide is part of the catalytic interface and that the 3’hydroxyl of the GTP ribose bound to each subunit is
essential for trans-activation of hydrolysis of the GTP bound to the other subunit. We show that both positive and
negative regulatory interactions between IRG proteins occur via the catalytic interface. Furthermore, mutations that
disrupt the catalytic interface also prevent Irga6 from accumulating on the parasitophorous vacuole membrane of
T. gondii, showing that GTP-dependent Irga6 activation is an essential component of the resistance mechanism.
Conclusions: The catalytic interface of Irga6 defined in the present experiments can probably be used as a
paradigm for the nucleotide-dependent interactions of all members of the large family of IRG GTPases, both
activating and regulatory. Understanding the activation mechanism of Irga6 will help to explain the mechanism by
which IRG proteins exercise their resistance function. We find no support from sequence or G-domain structure for
the idea that IRG proteins and the SRP GTPases have a common phylogenetic origin. It therefore seems probable,
if surprising, that the substrate-assisted catalytic mechanism has been independently evolved in the two protein
families.

Background
Immunity-related GTPases (IRG proteins/p47 GTPases)
are major contributors to cell autonomous resistance
against the intracellular protozoal pathogen, Toxoplasma
gondii [1-3]. For nomenclature of IRG proteins, see

expressed in cells induced by interferon-g (IFNg). Many
IRG proteins, including Irga6 (IIGP1) and Irgb6 (TGTP)
relocate from resting cytoplasmic compartments to the
parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) of avirulent
T. gondii [1,5,6]. Loading of IRG proteins onto the
T. gondii PVM is followed by vesiculation and rupture of
the PVM and death of the parasite [5,7,8]. Irga6 at the
PVM is in the active, GTP-bound state, while cytoplasmic Irga6 is inactive and probably GDP-bound [9,10].

is cooperatively activated [10,11]. These enzymatic properties of Irga6 together with the relatively high molecular mass of 47 kDa and the nucleotide binding affinities
in the micromolar range [11] are also found in several
other families of large GTPases, including members of
the dynamin superfamily [12], associated with membrane remodelling and, like Mx proteins, resistance
against intracellular pathogens [1,13].
The structure of the Irga6 protein was determined
some years ago [14]. The protein consists of a Ras-like
G-domain [15] and a helical domain (Additional file 1).
The G-domain contains three conserved GTP-binding
motifs (G1, G3 and G4) [16] and two flexible switch
regions, switch I and switch II [17]. Homology considerations suggest that the structure of Irga6 can provide
a reasonable template for the IRG family. Three members of the IRG family, Irgm1 (LRG-47), Irgm2 (GTPI)
and Irgm3 (IGTP), carry a unique substitution of the
otherwise universally conserved P-loop (G1 motif) lysine
(GKS subfamily) to methionine (GMS subfamily) (Additional file 2) [4,18]. In the absence of GDP-dependent
negative regulatory interactions with the three GMS
proteins, GKS subfamily members including Irga6 activate prematurely in the cytoplasm, form GTP-dependent
aggregates, and are unable to accumulate on the PVM
of invading T. gondii [9,10,19].
Little is known about the relationship between the
GTP-dependent activation of Irga6 and pathogen resistance. Our study poses some specific questions directed
towards an understanding of these processes at a molecular level: where are the interfaces that participate in oligomerisation and interactions with other IRG proteins, how
is GTP hydrolysis activated in the oligomeric complexes,
and finally, is oligomeric complex formation required for
resistance against T. gondii? We carried out an extensive
mutagenesis screen to address the first question and
found a novel interface of Irga6 located in the G-domain.
This interface is required for oligomerisation and for
accelerated hydrolysis of GTP. From experimental analysis of this interface we can propose a structural model for
the activation of GTP hydrolysis that is, surprisingly,
based on the hydrolytic mechanism of the signal recognition particle (SRP) and its receptor (SRa) [20,21]. We
demonstrate that the catalytic interface includes the
bound GTP substrate and that the 3’hydroxyl (3’OH) of
the nucleotide ribose is required for activation of hydrolysis in trans. We also show the engagement of the catalytic interface in both the activating interaction of Irga6
with Irgb6 [6,9] and the inhibitory interaction between
Irga6 and the GMS subfamily protein, Irgm3 [9]. Lastly,
we show that the integrity of the catalytic interface of
Irga6 is required for the accumulation of the active,
GTP-bound protein at the T. gondii PVM.

Results
The catalytic interface is localised on the G-domain

To gain insight into the mechanism of GTP-dependent
oligomerisation and activation of Irga6, a number of solvent-exposed residues identified from the known crystal
structure [14] were mutated (Figure 1), in large part
with bulky charged residues with the intention of disrupting putative intermolecular interactions. Mutations
of a contiguous cluster of G-domain residues (Glu77,
Gly103, Glu106, Ser132, Arg159, Lys161, Lys162,
Asp164, Asn191, Lys196) essentially abolished oligomerisation (Figure 2a and see below) and GTP hydrolysis
(Figure 2b and see below). Mutations of two further
residues in this cluster, Thr102 and Thr108, have been
shown elsewhere to lose both functions [22]. These residues define a surface (Figure 1a, red and orange), called
the catalytic interface, that includes the conformationally
labile switch I region (residues 100 to 109), suggesting
that the conformation of switch I is critical for dimer
formation and activation.
Mutations of the residues Arg31, Lys32, Lys169,
Lys176, Arg210 and Lys246 (Figure 1, yellow) also
reduced GTP-dependent oligomerisation to some extent
(Additional file 3), but none completely (compare Additional file 4 and 5). These residues formed a loosely
defined “secondary patch” on the Irga6 surface (Figure
1d, f). Unlike the catalytic interface, however, the secondary patch is interspersed with residues which, when
mutated, had no effect on oligomerisation, and indeed a
substantial part of the secondary patch area could be
replaced simultaneously without preventing oligomerisation (data not shown). At present, therefore, we do not
consider the secondary patch to be an oligomerisation
interface. The oligomerisation of Irga6 was not prevented by numerous other mutations (Figure 1, green),
suggesting the absence of a second well-defined surface
interface contributing to oligomerisation.
The majority of catalytic interface mutants including
T102A and T108A [22] had no significant effect on the
binding affinity for GTP (Additional file 6). Thus the failure of these mutants to oligomerise is not caused by
reduced nucleotide binding. The mutations E77A, R159E,
K161E and N191R slightly decreased the nucleotide binding affinity (Additional file 6) but it is unlikely that this
caused the loss of oligomerisation because the G4-motif
mutant, Irga6-D186N, with a considerably lower binding
affinity for guanine nucleotides, oligomerised relatively
efficiently in the presence of GTP (see below). Furthermore, none of the mutants of the secondary patch, which
all showed reduced nucleotide-binding affinities (Additional file 6), prevented oligomerisation of Irga6.
Irga6 crystallizes as a rotationally symmetrical dimer
[14] (Additional file 7). Mutants of the crystal dimer

interface were seen to oligomerise less efficiently than
the wild-type (WT) and it was suggested that this interface might participate in cooperative GTP-dependent
activation [14]. The crystal dimer interface does not

obstruct the catalytic interface described here (Additional file 8) and could therefore contribute to active
Irga6 oligomerisation. Mutants of the four crystal dimer
interface residues Leu44, Lys48, Ser172 and Met173,
that had been examined earlier [14], were therefore
re-assayed (Additional file 9). Mutants of nine further
residues (Glu37, Glu43, Glu142, Lys169, Lys175, Lys176,
Glu177, Arg218 and Glu224) in the crystal dimer interface were also analysed (Additional file 3). Under the
conditions of these experiments, which were more stringent than those used previously, out of 13 residues
mutated in the crystal dimer interface only the mutations of Lys169 and Lys176, two residues already identified in the secondary patch, partially inhibited
oligomerisation (Additional file 7). Furthermore, the formation of the crystal dimer is not nucleotide-dependent
[14], whereas the oligomerisation of Irga6 requires GTP
binding [11]. These arguments urge that the crystal
dimer interface does not identify the oligomerisation
interface associated with activation. Thus no convincing
second interface required for oligomerisation has yet
been found on the surface of the known crystal structure [14] of Irga6 (Figure 1), suggesting that oligomerisation requires a cryptic interface exposed following
GTP binding or dimer formation at the catalytic
interface.
The catalytic interaction of the SRP GTPases provides a
scaffold for a model of the Irga6 dimer

Although usually discussed in the context of dynamin
and its relatives, Irga6 also resembles in several respects
two GTPases of the SRP family, Ffh (SRP54 homologue)
and FtsY (SRa homologue). Ffh, FtsY and Irga6 share a
wide-open nucleotide-binding pocket in their nucleotidebound state [14,23,24]. Ffh [25], FtsY [26] and Irga6 [11]
share nearly identical low nucleotide-binding affinities,

caused by a high substrate dissociation rate. Ffh and FtsY
are significantly homologous to each other and form a
GTP-dependent heterodimer. Each acts in trans as a
GTPase activating protein (GAP) for the other in the
dimeric complex [27]. Irga6 molecules work as mutual
GAPs in GTP-dependent oligomeric complexes [11].
The common biochemical and structural properties suggested that the mechanism of cooperative hydrolysis
known from Ffh and FtsY could be relevant for understanding the catalytic mechanism of Irga6. The key to
this idea is the catalytic interaction between the two closely opposed GTP molecules in anti-parallel orientation
and, specifically, the crystallographically determined, catalytically important reciprocal trans interactions between
the 3’OHs and the g-phosphates [20,21]. Coordinates of
the nucleotides from the crystal structure of the FfhFtsY heterodimer from Egea and colleagues (PDB 1RJ9)
[20] (Figure 3a) were used to define the position in
space of the nucleotides bound by two Irga6 molecules
(Figure 3b and 3c). The Irga6-M173A GppNHp complex
structure (Additional file 1) was used for this analysis
since this structure was the only one that resolved all
residues between Glu12 and the C-terminal Asn413
(PDB 1TQ6) [14].
In the Irga6 dimer model thus constructed (Figure 4
and Additional file 10) the two Irga6 molecules complement each other well, apart from one overlap of the two
atomic structures made by the side chain of Arg159
(Additional files 11, 12 and 13). The buried surface area
in the hypothetical Irga6 dimer is 2400 Å2 (Additional
file 8a, b). The modeled catalytic interface surface is in
good agreement with the mutagenesis data. All the residues where mutation destroyed oligomerisation are
located within or proximal to the contact area of the
dimer subunits (Figure 4). The only exception is Lys101,
localised just inside the margin of the catalytic interface
surface though oriented outwards (Figure 4a, b), where
mutation had no effect on oligomerisation (Figure 2a).

The ribose of the bound nucleotide is part of the catalytic
interface

At the core of the Irga6 dimer model the 2’ and 3’OHs
of GTP ribose form part of the contact surface. Modifications of the nucleotide ribose at the 2’ or 3’OH would
therefore be expected to interfere with oligomerisation.
Oligomerisation of Irga6 in the presence of 2’/3’O-(Nmethylanthraniloyl)-GTP (mant-GTP) was investigated.
Mant is a small fluorescent group bound via the 2’ or
3’oxygen to the GTP ribose in mant-GTP, a nucleotide
analog used in affinity determinations (Figure 5a). Consistent with the lack of free space between the subunits
of the dimer model, mant-GTP was unable to stimulate
oligomerisation of Irga6 (Figure 5b). Mant-groupdependent inhibition of complex formation was also
observed for Irga6 protein immunoprecipitated from
cells (N. Papic, unpublished data). The inhibitory effect
of the mant-group is not caused by reduced nucleotide
binding [11], implying as predicted from the dimer
model that the GTP ribose is part of the interaction
interface between Irga6 oligomer subunits.
The base of bound nucleotide is part of the catalytic
interface

In the Irga6 dimer model the bound nucleotides are part
of the interaction interface of the two subunits. The specificity of GTPases for guanine nucleotides is determined by a conserved aspartate in the G4-motif. This
aspartate interacts with the exocyclic amino-group of
the guanine ring at the C2 position (Figure 6a). The
substitution of the G4 aspartate by asparagine changes
the nucleotide specificity of GTPases from guanine to
xanthine nucleotides, which have an oxo-group at the

by TLC and autoradiography.

C2 position (Figure 6b). The D251N mutation in the
G4-motif of Ffh changes the binding preference of the
protein from GTP to xanthosine-5’triphosphate (XTP).
It was shown that GTP-initiated complex formation
between the two SRP GTPases, Ffh-D251N and FtsY, is
inhibited by addition of XTP [28]. The C2 amino-group
is part of the interaction surface between Ffh and FtsY
therefore the binding of XTP to Ffh-D251N alters the
interface and inhibits complex formation.
The nucleotide-binding preference of Irga6 was changed from guanine to xanthine based nucleotides by the
corresponding G4-motif mutation D186N (Additional
file 14). Unexpectedly, despite a nine-fold higher affinity
for XTP than for GTP, Irga6-D186N hydrolysed GTP
more efficiently than XTP (Additional file 15). Oligomerisation of Irga6-D186N (Figure 6c) accompanied by
GTPase activity (Figure 6d) could be activated by GTP,
albeit inefficiently, and both were abolished when the
high affinity ligand, XTP, was added at a concentration
1/10 that of GTP (Figure 6c, d). This shows that the
replacement of the surface exposed C2 amino-group, of

The model of the Irga6 dimer is based on reciprocal trans
interactions between the ribose 3’OHs and the g-phosphates of the opposed nucleotides [20,21], analogous to
those shown to be crucial for the reciprocal activation of
GTP hydrolysis between the paired GTPases, Ffh and
FtsY [20,27]. The involvement of the 2’ and 3’OHs of
GTP in Irga6 oligomerisation and GTP hydrolysis was
investigated. Oligomerisation of Irga6 could be stimulated by GTP and 2’deoxy-GTP (2’dGTP), both of which
have the 3’OH. In contrast, no complex formation was
observed in presence of 3’deoxy-GTP (3’dGTP) and
2’3’dideoxy-GTP (2’3’ddGTP), both of which lack the
3’OH (Figure 7a and Additional file 16a). Consistent with
these results, only basal hydrolysis rates of about
0.02 min-1 were found for 3’dGTP and 2’3’ddGTP in contrast to efficient hydrolysis of GTP or 2’dGTP (Figure
7b). The oligomerisation rate in presence of 2’dGTP was
somewhat reduced (Figure 7a), consistent with the idea
that the 2’OH is part of the catalytic interface, as suggested by the model. But, unlike the 3’OH the 2’OH is
not required for cooperative hydrolysis (Additional file
16b). The removal of the 2’ or 3’OH of the GTP ribose
decreased the nucleotide-binding affinity slightly (Additional file 14). However, as already argued, the Kd variation alone cannot be responsible for the observed
inability of 3’dGTP and 2’3’ddGTP to stimulate Irga6 oligomerisation at millimolar nucleotide concentrations.
For the Ffh-FtsY heterodimer the essential activation
function of the 3’OH is mediated in trans [20]. We,
therefore, investigated whether the basal hydrolysis of
radioactively labeled 3’dGTP could be enhanced by addition of unlabeled GTP, 2’dGTP, 3’dGTP or 2’3’ddGTP.
Since each Irga6 monomer has only one nucleotidebinding site, an increase in 3’dGTP hydrolysis by addition of GTP must be due to an activation by a second,
GTP-loaded, monomer in trans. Furthermore, transactivation of hydrolysis of 3’dGTP, a nucleotide which
itself does not contain the 3’OH, would show the dispensability of the 3’OH in cis. Consistent with the Irga6
dimer model the addition of GTP and 2’dGTP stimulated the hydrolysis of labeled 3’dGTP, whereas the
addition of 3’dGTP and 2’3’ddGTP had an inhibitory
effect (Figure 7c). Therefore, the 3’OH is required in

A model of the dimer interaction responsible for the
trans activation of hydrolysis of labeled 3’dGTP by unlabeled GTP is shown in Figure 7d.
Glu106 is a key residue crucial for the activation of
catalysis

The core of the Irga6 dimer model is created by the reciprocal trans interactions of the GTP 3’OHs with the
g-phosphates. These enforce a specific relative orientation of the two nucleotides and, therefore, also of the two
protein molecules to which the nucleotides are bound.
The dimer model suggests additional trans interactions
between the 3’OHs and the Glu106 residues (Figure 8a).
The involvement of Glu106 in the activation of GTP
hydrolysis was investigated. Glu106 is part of the catalytic
interface (Figure 1a). The mutants E106K and E106R
essentially abolished oligomerisation (Additional file 17).

E106N, could oligomerise to a considerable extent (Figure 8c). Nevertheless, no mutation of Glu106 could activate hydrolysis, whether oligomerising or not (Figure 8d).
Thus, Glu106 is a residue essential for the activation of
GTP hydrolysis independently of a role in the contact
interface.
Glu106 is part of the flexible switch I region which
undergoes nucleotide-dependent conformational
changes [14]. In the GDP state Glu106 is exposed and
points away from the bound nucleotide, a spatial
arrangement that is incompatible with the formation of
the dimer as suggested by the model (Figure 8b). However, in the GppNHp state Glu106 can be reoriented
towards the g-phosphate of the bound nucleotide [14].
The GTP ribose 3’OH may stabilize the Glu106 residue
in trans in a conformation allowing complex formation
and in an orientation required for activation of the catalytic water molecule in cis (Figure 8a). This could initiate a nucleophilic attack on the g-phosphate and
activate GTP hydrolysis.

In addition to forming GTP-dependent homomeric
complexes in vitro [11] and in vivo [10] Irga6 can also
form heteromeric nucleotide-dependent complexes with
other members of the IRG family. The GKS protein,
Irgb6, interacts strongly with Irga6 in yeast 2-hybrid
assays in a nucleotide-dependent manner [9]. This is a
positive interaction that assists the accumulation of
Irga6 on the PVM of T. gondii [6,9]. We could observe
this interaction in a pull-down assay between recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged Irga6 and
Irgb6 from IFNg-induced cell lysates (Figure 9a). The
interaction was GTPgS-dependent and failed in the presence of GDP (Figure 9a). The importance of the catalytic interface for this interaction was demonstrated by
the complete failure of GTPgS-dependent pull-downs
with catalytic interface mutants of Irga6 (Figure 9a).
The three GMS proteins, Irgm1, Irgm2 and Irgm3, are
essential negative regulators of Irga6 [9]. For Irgm3 this
interaction has been shown to be GDP-dependent and
inhibited by GTPgS [9]. In cells, in the absence of this
interaction, Irga6 binds GTP, activates spontaneously,
and cannot accumulate on PVMs of invading T. gondii
[9,10]. We were able to confirm the previously documented GDP-dependent interaction between IFNg-induced
Irgm3 and recombinant Irga6 in a pull-down assay, and
additionally showed that no interaction occurred when

In IFNg stimulated cells about 60% of Irga6 colocalises
with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) while the remainder
is cytosolic [19]. Upon infection with T. gondii the protein
accumulates on the PVM [5,6], depleting other cytoplasmic compartments. IRG protein-dependent destruction of
the PVM and subsequent death of the parasite occurs in
IFNg-induced cells [8,19]. It is not known whether the
process of Irga6 oligomer formation is causally connected
with immunity against T. gondii. This issue was addressed
in the context of the accumulation of Irga6 at the T. gondii
PVM [5]. Irga6-deficient cells, stimulated with IFNg
and transiently transfected with WT or mutant Irga6,
were infected with the avirulent T. gondii strain ME49
(Figure 10a). WT Irga6 accumulated on the PVM, while
all mutants of the catalytic interface showed quantitatively
(Figure 10b) and qualitatively (Additional file 18) drastically reduced recruitment to the PVM. The sole exception
was Lys162, located at the rim of the catalytic interface
and the secondary patch (Figure 1a). Mutations of this
residue inhibited oligomerisation and catalytic activity
in vitro (Figure 2) but did not prevent accumulation of the
mutant protein on the PVM (Figure 10b). The contribution of Lys162 to the catalytic interface is ambiguous: the
structural model places the residue just inside the interface. It is possible that the configuration of the Irga6 catalytic interface in vivo differs slightly from that in vitro.
This could be due to a conformational effect of the myristoyl group, which is exposed by GTP binding in vivo [10]
and required for vacuolar accumulation (N. Papic, unpublished data). Equally, the predominant catalytic dimers
that form in vivo may be heterodimers between Irga6 and
other IRG proteins rather than Irga6 homodimers [6,9].
Heterodimeric catalytic interfaces may be slightly different
from the Irga6 homodimer interface assayed here.

mant-GDP was used (Figure 9b), hinting at usage of the
catalytic interface. This was confirmed when two of four
mutants of the catalytic interface also blocked the GDPdependent interaction of Irgm3 with Irga6 (Figure 9b).
The two residues whose mutation did not interfere with
Irga6-Irgm3 interaction, Gly103 and Ser132, are located
in a different part of the catalytic interface from Arg159
and Asn191. These results suggest that the GDP-dependent negative regulatory interaction between Irgm3 and
Irga6 indeed involves the catalytic interface, but with a
slightly different orientation or a higher affinity from that
of the GTP-dependent activating interaction.

the formation of Irga6 oligomers. This interface provides
a platform for both positive and negative nucleotidedependent regulatory interactions between Irga6 molecules and other members of the IRG protein family
(Figure 9). These interactions are essential for the activity
of the IRG proteins in resistance to T. gondii (Figure 10)
[9]. The revealed surface is part of the G-domain, including the nucleotide-binding site and the switch regions
(Figure 1). The nucleotide itself is part of the interface
(Figures 5 and 6). Structural and biochemical features
common to the SRP GTPases and Irga6 suggested a
model (Figure 3) for the Irga6 dimer based on the relative
orientation of the two nucleotides buried in the SRP-SRa
complex [20,21]. The mutagenesis data were consistent

Pawlowski et al. BMC Biology 2011, 9:7
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/7

with the proposed model (Figure 4), but the key to the
activation of GTP hydrolysis by SRP and SRa in the
dimeric complex is the reciprocal trans interaction
between the 3’OH of the GTP ribose and the g-phosphate
of the two nucleotides [20,21]. In strong support for the
validity of the SRP-SRa based model of the Irga6 dimer,
the 3’OH of the GTP ribose proved to be absolutely
required for oligomerisation and GTP hydrolysis by Irga6
and, as in SRP-SRa, this function was exercised in trans
only (Figure 7).
Functionally, Irga6 seems closer to the dynamins in
that it is involved in the vesiculation and disruption of
the PVM [5], yet the catalytic geometry appears far closer to the SRP GTPases. Despite this distinctive similarity, however, the IRG and SRP protein families appear
to be completely unrelated to each other in sequence in
those parts of the molecule that compose the catalytic
interface (Additional file 19) and belong, in fact, to the
two different major clades (SIMIBI and TRAFAC) that
have been defined over multiple GTPase families [29]. If
indeed, IRG proteins share the unusual catalytic
mechanism of SRP [20,21] then these proteins appear to
represent convergent approaches to the same solution.
For the SRP GTPases it is clear that the solution is
ancient, but until a convincing ancestry for the IRG proteins is found it is not possible to say whether their
organization is ancient or derived.
Alternative Irga6 dimer models

So far, the majority of dimeric GTPases for which structure is known engage the two monomers in a parallel
orientation and the two nucleotides are separated and
do not interact [1,30,31]. In contrast, the SRP-SRa
paired GTPases engage the two monomers in an antiparallel orientation with the two nucleotides in reciprocal atomic contact [20,21]. We explored the feasibility of
alternative models of the Irga6 dimer based on the relative orientation of the nucleotides, and consequently of
the G-domains, found in the dimeric structures of other
GTPases and related ATPases (data not shown). None
provided a satisfactory basis on which to explain the
properties of Irga6. In models based on EHD2 [32],
MeaB [33] and MnmE [34], the two Irga6 G-domains
interact via different surfaces that do not include the
bound nucleotides. The models based on SEPT2 [35],
GIMAP2 [36], BDLP [37], Toc34 [38] and Soj [39]
engage small parts of the catalytic interface in limited
interfaces. The catalytic interface is involved in the models based on HypB [40] and Av2 [41]. The model based
on hGBP1 [42] involves the catalytic interface but the
subunits overlap in the contact area. The dynamin [43]
based model would involve the catalytic interface, if the
subunits were closer. However, none of the alternative
models engaging the catalytic interface bring the two

Page 9 of 15

nucleotides into atomic contact. None of the models of
the Irga6 dimer except that based on SRP-SRa offer an
explanation for the critical requirement in trans of the
3’hydroxyl of the GTP ribose for the activation of catalysis (Figure 7c).
The activation of GTP hydrolysis in Irga6 complexes

GAPs work by supplementation of missing catalytic residues (arginine finger; asparagine thumb), and by reorientation and stabilization of the catalytic machinery
which is already present in the target protein [44-46].
The model of the Irga6 dimer suggests that the switch
regions are stabilized by the interaction of the two Irga6
molecules. In particular, the model suggests that Glu106
(switch I) is stabilized by the trans interaction with the
3’OH of the GTP ribose (Figure 8a). Mutational analysis
of Glu106 (Figure 8c, d) together with structural data
[14] urge that this residue activates the catalytic water
molecule for the nucleophilic attack on the g-phosphate
in cis and is therefore crucial for the activation of GTP
hydrolysis. The finding that the 3’OH of the GTP ribose
is essential for activation of GTP hydrolysis in trans
(Figure 7c) is consistent with the anticipated function of
Glu106.
On complex formation between Ffh and FtsY catalytic
residues of the switch I region become reoriented and
facilitate GTP hydrolysis in cis. It is proposed that aspartates activate the catalytic water molecules, and that
arginines coordinate the g-phosphates [20,21,47]. In contrast to the Irga6 dimer model, there is no trans interaction between the 3’OHs and the catalytic aspartates in
the Ffh-FtsY complex; the catalytic aspartates approach
the g-phosphates from a different direction [20,21]. It
may be relevant that acidic residues have been implicated in activating the catalytic water in further dimerforming GTPases, MeaB [33], MnmE [34] and HypB
[40], as also in related ATPases, Soj [39] and Av2 [41].
The Irga6 dimer model does not suggest any positivelycharged residue that could fulfill an arginine finger-like
function. The mutation of the most promising candidate,
Lys101 in switch I, to glutamate had no effect on complex
formation or GTP hydrolysis (Figure 2). The non-necessity
of an arginine finger-like residue was demonstrated for
Ran and Rap; instead, in both cases a tyrosine OH was
found to interact with the g-phosphate, and, in the case of
Ran, also with the catalytic glutamine [48,49]. These interactions recall the proposed trans interactions of the 3’OH
of the GTP ribose with the g-phosphate and Glu106 in the
Irga6 dimer model (Figure 8a). Generally, the transition
state in Irga6 could be stabilized in cis and in trans by
hydrogen bond donation from the residues surrounding
the nucleotide and also from water molecules that, by
analogy to Ffh-FtsY [20,21], potentially bridge the two
opposed nucleotides.

The catalytic interface - a general interaction platform
involved in activation and regulation

The catalytic interface is the most conserved part of the
Irga6 surface (Additional file 20). It probably represents a
central platform engaged in functional interactions
between IRG proteins in general. Heteromeric interactions
between Irga6 and other members of the IRG family play
important regulatory roles in the biological action of Irga6.
While Irgb6 enhances the accumulation of activated Irga6
[10] on the T. gondii PVM [6,9], Irgm3 prevents the premature activation of Irga6 prior to infection by locking the
GDP-bound state of the protein [9]. In vitro, the catalytic
interface is involved in the GTP-dependent Irga6-Irgb6
interaction (Figure 9a) and also in the GDP-dependent
Irga6-Irgm3 interaction (Figure 9b). These results show
that the negative regulatory interaction between Irga6 and
Irgm3 occurs, like the activating Irga6-Irga6 and Irga6Irgb6 interactions, via the catalytic interface. The outcome
of the Irga6-Irgm3 interaction thus resembles the primary
action of a GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) [9]. Thus two
different functions (GAP and GDI) seem to be mediated
through the catalytic interface. All tested mutants of the
catalytic interface prevented the Irga6-Irgb6 interaction
(Figure 9a), but the Irga6-Irgm3 interaction was prevented
only by a subset of the mutants (Figure 9b) suggesting a
distinct mode of interaction. The catalytic interface of the
GMS proteins, including Irgm3, contains specific substitutions (Additional file 2). The otherwise conserved residues
Glu106, Asp164 and Arg159, which are crucial for oligomerisation and GTP hydrolysis, are substituted by arginine, histidine and glutamine respectively in the GMS
proteins. The corresponding mutations, E106R, D164H
and R159Q in Irga6 have deleterious effects on GTPdependent complex formation and hydrolysis activation
(Figure 8 and Additional file 11). The specific modifications of the catalytic interface in GMS proteins may facilitate complex formation with GDP-bound GKS proteins,
thus prolonging their inactive state in the absence of
infection.
The catalytic interface plays a central role in the
antimicrobial function and is a target for a T. gondii
virulence factor

Upon infection with avirulent T. gondii Irga6 accumulates at the PVM and participates in disruption of the
PVM and killing of the parasite [5,8]. The accumulation
of IRG proteins at the PVM is a prerequisite for the
antimicrobial function [5,6,8]. The biological importance
of complexes formed via the catalytic interface is shown
by the fact that mutations of this surface strongly diminish the accumulation of Irga6 on the PVM of avirulent
T. gondii (Figure 10). Irga6, with other IRG proteins,
does not accumulate normally on the PVM of virulent
T. gondii and the parasites survive and continue to

Page 10 of 15

replicate [6,8,50]. The secreted ROP18 kinase [51] is a
major virulence factor of T. gondii [52]. The significance
of the catalytic interface for the function of Irga6 is
highlighted by the recent finding that the virulence-associated ROP18 kinase from virulent, but not avirulent,
T. gondii strains phosphorylates conserved threonine
residues, Thr102 and Thr108, in switch I within the catalytic interface of Irga6, thus blocking oligomerisation,
GTPase activity and the accumulation of Irga6 at the
PVM [22].

Conclusions
An intracellular way of life can protect pathogens from
antibodies, but hosts can deploy other specialized
defense mechanisms against such pathogens. Toxoplasma gondii, is an intracellular protozoal pathogen of
mammals and birds, and commonly infects humans.
Mice exploit a specialized intracellular resistance system,
the immunity-related GTPases (IRG proteins), for
defense against T. gondii. The IRG protein, Irga6, accumulates rapidly on the membrane surrounding intracellular parasites. Shortly after, this membrane ruptures
and the parasite dies. The enzymatic activity, required
for the antimicrobial function, of Irga6 is activated in
oligomeric complexes formed by the protein.
We define one of the contact surfaces involved in
Irga6 oligomerisation, the so-called catalytic interface,
which is a part of the G-domain and to which the
bound nucleotide contributes. This strongly conserved
interface participates in the positive and negative regulatory interactions of Irga6 with Irgb6 and Irgm3
respectively, thus it is a universal platform engaged in
interactions between and regulation of IRG proteins.
The catalytic interface is essential for the accumulation
of Irga6 on the membrane, surrounding T. gondii
within infected cells, and is therefore required for the
antimicrobial function of the protein.
Further, we propose a model for the dimer formed via
the catalytic interface of Irga6, based on the unique substrate geometry and catalytic machinery found in the
dimeric complex of the signal recognition particle, Ffh
(SRP54), and its receptor, FtsY (SRa). The reciprocal
catalytic interaction, made in trans by the 3’hydroxyl of
the bound nucleotide ribose, determines the relative
orientation of the signal recognition particle and its
receptor in the dimeric complex. The 3’hydroxyl of the
nucleotide ribose is also essential for Irga6 complex formation and activation of GTP hydrolysis in trans. The
model also explains how a catalytic glutamate residue is
engaged in the activation of catalysis.
Since there is no distinctive sequence homology
between the SRP GTPases and Irga6, we consider that
the functional similarity between these two GTPase
families is probably the result of convergent evolution.

Methods
Nomenclature of IRG proteins

Irga6, the main subject of this study was originally named
IIGP [18,53]. The name was later modified to IIGP1 and
biochemical [11] and structural [14] studies on the protein were performed under this name. The nomenclature
of the whole protein family was rationalized in 2005
under the generic name IRG (immunity-related GTPases)
to accommodate its genomic structure and phylogenetic
complexity [4], and IIGP1 was renamed Irga6.
Expression constructs and mutagenesis

Expression constructs were generated by site directed
mutagenesis in pGEX-4T-2-Irga6 [11] and pGW1HIrga6-cTag1 [10] using the QuickChange protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). Primers used (including
reverse complement sequences) are listed in Additional
file 21.
Recombinant protein expression and purification

Irga6 protein was expressed as N-terminal GST fusions
from pGEX-4T-2 constructs in Escherichia coli BL21
upon overnight induction with 0.1 mM IPTG at 18°C.
The cells were lysed in PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM
KCl, 10.1 mM Na 2 HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2 PO4 , pH 7.4)/2
mM DTT/Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail
EDTA free (Roche, Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany) using
a microfluidiser (EmulsiFlex-C5; Avestin, Ottawa,
Ontario, Canada). Cleared lysates were purified on a
GSTrap FF glutathione Sepharose affinity column (GE
Healthcare, Munich, Germany) in PBS/2 mM DTT.
GST was cleaved off by overnight incubation of the
resin with thrombin (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) at
4°C. Irga6 was eluted with PBS/2 mM DTT. Protein
containing fractions were subjected to size exclusion
chromatography (Superdex 75; GE Healthcare, Munich,
Germany) in B1 buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 5 mM
MgCl 2 )/2 mM DTT. Irga6 containing fractions were
concentrated with Vivaspin 20 centrifugal concentrator
(Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany). When indicated, an
abbreviated protein purification procedure was used;
omitting size exclusion chromatography and purifying
Irga6 by glutathione affinity chromatography only.
Oligomerisation assays

Oligomerisation of Irga6 was monitored in B1 buffer/2
mM DTT by conventional or dynamic light scattering
(DLS). For both, conventional and DLS, the protein buffer solution (90 μl) was cleared by ultracentrifugation
(100,000 g, 30 minutes, 4°C). The reaction was started
by addition of ice cold nucleotide (10 μl) to the protein
buffer solution. The reaction was mixed by pipetting
and transferred immediately to a cuvette. Conventional

light scattering was performed at 350 or 600 nm at 37°C
in an Aminco-Bowman 2 Luminescence Spectrometer
(SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL, USA) or a DM45
Spectrofluorimeter (Olis, Bogart, GA, USA). Due to the
unit-less readout the values obtained from the two
instruments cannot be directly compared. DLS was performed at 650 nm at 20°C or 37°C with a DynaPro-E20-660 molecular sizing instrument (Protein Solutions;
Wyatt Technologies, Santa Barbara, CA, USA). Data
were obtained and analysed using the DYNAMICS 5
and 6 software. Values of hydrodynamic radius given on
the ordinates reflect the population mean particle size.
Note that the derived hydrodynamic radius is not equal
to the real size of the oligomer. WT and mutant Irga6
(with the exception of D164R and D164K) were stable
and did not aggregate at 37°C in the presence of GDP.
Nucleotide hydrolysis assays

Nucleotide hydrolysis was measured in B1 buffer/2 mM
DTT either by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and autoradiography or by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). For TLC and autoradiography, Irga6 was
incubated with the indicated amounts of unlabeled nucleotide and traces of radioactively labeled nucleotide. The
reaction was separated on PEI Cellulose F TLC plates
(Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in 1 M acetic acid/0.8 M
LiCl. Signals were detected with the BAS 1000 phosphoimager analysis system (Fujifilm, Duesseldorf, Germany)
and quantified with AIDA Image Analyser 3 (Raytest,
Straubenhardt, Germany) or ImageQuant TL 7 (GE
Healthcare, Munich, Germany) software. For HPLC, the
reaction was stopped by 10-fold dilution in 10 mM NaOH;
nucleotides were separated by ion exchange chromatography (MiniQ 4.6/50 PE; GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany)
in 10 mM NaOH over a NaCl gradient. Absorption at 254
nm was monitored. Unicorn 4.12 (GE Healthcare, Munich,
Germany) was used for quantification of peak areas.
Nucleotide binding measurement

Nucleotide-binding affinities were determined by equilibrium titration of Irga6 in the range of 0 to 100 μM
against 0.5 mM mant nucleotide in B1 buffer/2 mM DTT
at 20°C. The mant nucleotide was excited at 355 nm, and
monitored at 448 nm in an Aminco-Bowman 2 Luminescence Spectrometer (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL,
USA). Equilibrium dissociation constants were obtained
as described by [54]. SigmaPlot 9 (Systat, Chicago, IL,
USA) was used for dissociation constant (Kd) calculation.
Pull-down

IFNg-induced (200 U/ml) gs3T3 cells were lysed for one
hour at 4°C in PBS/0.1% Thesit (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA)/3 mM MgCl 2 /Complete Mini

Protease Inhibitor Cocktail EDTA free (Roche, Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany). Postnuclear supernatants were
incubated at 4°C overnight with glutathione Sepharose
4B (GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany)-bound recombinant GST-Irga6 with 0.5 mM of the indicated nucleotide. Cellular proteins were eluted from the washed
beads with 100 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.5/0.5% SDS for
30 minutes at room temperature and subjected to SDSPAGE and Western blot. Irgb6 and Irgm3 were detected
using mouse monoclonal antibodies B34 [55] and antiIGTP (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) respectively. Input of recombinant GST-Irga6 was monitored
by Ponceau S staining.
Cell culture and T. gondii infection

T. gondii ME49 tachyzoites were passaged and used for
infection of Irga6-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEFs) [5] as described earlier [6]. MEFs were transiently transfected with pGW1H-Irga6-cTag1 [10] constructs using FuGENE 6 (Roche, Grenzach-Wyhlen,
Germany) and stimulated with 200 U/ml IFNg (Peprotech, Hamburg, Germany) for 24 hours followed by
infection with T. gondii at a multiplicity of infection of 7
for 2 hours, synchronised by centrifugation. Cells were
fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes and used
for indirect immunostaining.

Additional file 10: Irga6 dimer model. Atomic coordinates (structural
PDB file) of the constructed (Figure 3) Irga6 dimer model (Figure 4).
Additional file 11: Asp164 and Arg159 participate in
oligomerisation. For the construction of the Irga6 dimer model a rigid
crystal structure was used. In the model the side chains of the Arg159
residues of the two subunits collide. Arg159 is located close to Asp164 on
the other subunit. Asp164 forms the bottom of a pocket, derived from
two loops. One loop is located between Glu77 and Ser80 and contains a
part of the G1-motif. The other loop is located between Ile155 and
Asn163. The conformation of Arg159 is relatively unconstrained [14].
A conformational change may occur during complex formation,
reorienting Arg159 and inserting the side chain into the pocket on the
opposed molecule to form a salt bridge with Asp164 in trans. Arg159 is
part of the catalytic interface (Figure 1a). Consistent with this, mutations of
Arg159 had deleterious effects on oligomerisation (Additional file 12).
Asp164 is not solvent exposed, but withdrawn from the surface of the
protein at the bottom of a pocket. It is therefore striking that even a mild
mutation like D164N prevented oligomerisation (Additional file 13). (a and
b) View of the nucleotide-binding region. (a) The Irga6 dimer model
(Figure 4) is shown. Arg159, Asp164 (cyan subunit) and Arg159 (magenta
