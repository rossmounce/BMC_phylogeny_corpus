Abstract
Background: Evolutionary biologists have so far largely treated the testis as a black box with a
certain size, a matching resource demand and a resulting sperm output. A better understanding of
the way that the testis responds to selection may come from recent developments in theoretical
biology aimed at understanding the factors that influence the evolution of tissue architecture (i.e.
the logical organisation of a tissue). Here we perform a comparative analysis of aspects of testicular
architecture of the fruit fly family Drosophilidae. Specifically, we collect published information on
the number of first (or primary) spermatocytes in spermatogenesis, which allows to infer an
important aspect of testicular architecture.
Results: We show that testicular architecture is much more variable (both within and between
species) than is generally appreciated. Moreover, the number of first spermatocytes is strongly
correlated to the sperm length, which is inversely related to the sperm production, and thus the
workload of the testis.
Conclusion: Our study clearly documents that tissue architecture can evolve, and that in the
Drosophilidae it may do so in response to sexual selection. We conclude that the testis of the
Drosophilidae is a promising model organ to test recent models of tissue architecture.

Background
It is generally accepted that sperm competition [1,2] can
lead to selection for increased resource allocation towards
the production of ejaculates and that different levels of
sperm competition can cause rapid evolution of testis size
[3-7]. However, selection due to sperm competition does
not act on testis size per se, but on sperm production
(sperm number and size). In other words, testis size
evolves in response to the demand placed on sperm production by sperm competition. In spite of this, evolution-

ary biologists have to date largely treated the testis as a
black box with a certain size, a matching resource demand
and a resulting sperm output. Here we explore how the
machinery of the testis may react to different sperm production demands (a change in which may be reflected in
testis size).
For this it is useful to consider recent theoretical models
that investigate the factors that influence the evolution of
optimal tissue architecture [8-10]. In this context the term

Four different tissue architectures that lead to 8 differentiated cells (green) and one stem cell (red)
Figure 1
Four different tissue architectures that lead to 8 differentiated cells (green) and one stem cell (red). All tissue
architectures require the same number of cell divisions, but individual cells divide different numbers of times. On the left the
stem cell divides only once (ns = 1) to produce a transit cell (black) that in turn divides binomially three times (nt = 3), which
produces a total of eight differentiated cells (k = ns × 2 n t = 1 × 23 = 8). On the right the stem cell divides eight times and no
transit cells are produced (ns = 8, nt = 0, k = 8 × 20 = 8). The other two tissue architectures are intermediate cases (centre left:
ns = 2, nt = 2, k = 2 × 22 = 8; centre right, ns = 4, nt = 1, k = 4 × 21 = 8). The complete tissue will consist of N stem cells and thus
be able to produce T = N × k differentiated cells. If the tissue is a testis each of these differentiated cells will go through the two
meiotic divisions and will thus produce T = N × 4 × k sperm.

tissue architecture refers to the logical organisation of a
tissue (Fig. 1) rather than its detailed histological morphology. Although these theoretical models were originally formulated for tissues such as skin and gut epithelia
they should also apply to the testis, which also has an epithelial organization.
The testicular epithelium is a complex tissue that contains
different types of somatic and germ cells. In vertebrates
somatic cells (e.g. Sertoli cells) make up an substantial
portion of the epithelium and they have important nourishing functions for the developing sperm. In contrast, in
many insects the somatic cells (e.g. cyst cells) contribute
relatively little to the testis in terms of overall size. The
germ cells are organized into long-lived basal stem cells
(spermatogonia) and short-lived differentiating transit
cells (spermatocytes and spermatids). The sperm can be
produced through different patterns of stem vs. transit cell

divisions (as in Fig. 1) and they are then shed at the surface of the testicular epithelium. The different division
patterns can be seen to represent different tissue architectures.
Should we expect that selection on sperm production acts
on tissue architecture? The main aspect that the theoretical models have investigated so far is how proliferationinduced mutations can affect the function of the tissue
and the survival of the individual harbouring the tissue in
the context of cancer. Epithelial tissues generally have
high cell division rates and this can lead to a high risk of
proliferation-induced somatic mutations. The question
therefore is if certain tissue architectures may be less riskprone than others. One theoretical study concludes that
the architectural organization of a tissue into a 'linear
process', with basal stem cells and differentiating transit
cells, may itself be an adaptation to protect the tissue

against the initiation of cancer [9]. Another study concludes that the workload of a tissue (i.e. the number of
cells the tissue has to produce) can affect the optimal patterns of stem vs. transit cell divisions, and hence the optimal tissue architecture [8]. Finally, the division of the
tissue into stem vs. transit cells may also result from constraints on the length of the transit cell lineage, which is
expected to select for a lowered mutation rate in stem cells
compared to transit cells [8,11].
Other factors that have not yet been modelled theoretically, but which we expect to be important are linked to
the temporal and cellular demand that selection places on
the tissue. A tissue that has to produce many cells in a
short amount of time may need to shift cell divisions
towards the transit cells in order to exploit the exponential
nature of that part of the tissue architecture (i.e. the architecture on the left in Fig. 1 produces eight cells in four
rounds of cell division, whereas the architecture on the
right requires eight rounds of cell division). Moreover, in
a short-lived or semelparous organism the fitness cost
associated with developing testicular cancer may be lower
than in a more long-lived iteroparous organism, where
future reproduction is an important fitness component.
Therefore more risk-averse division strategies are expected
in iteroparous organisms. Finally, a tissue that has to produce large differentiated cells may reduce the number of
transit cell divisions in order to avoid the halving of the
cell size in every cell division.
As outlined above, sperm competition leads to frequent
changes in the demand on sperm production imposed on
the testis. Testicular architecture may therefore vary either

somatic stem cells

within species or between closely related species. Moreover, because the demand on skin or gut epithelia is
expected to be much less variable, the testis can serve as an
interesting model tissue for studies of optimal tissue
architecture. As we show below, the testis of the fruit fly
family Drosophilidae allows to easily determine important aspects of testicular architecture and we therefore
think it is a particularly promising model tissue to study
its evolution. The first aim of our study is to investigate if
variation exists in testicular architecture within and
between closely related species among the Drosophilidae.
The second aim is to attempt to explain at least some of
the observed variation in tissue architecture, to discuss it
in the context of the existing models, and to suggest directions for future research.
The testis and spermatogenesis of the Drosophilidae
The organization of the testis and the process of spermatogenesis are known in great detail for Drosophila melanogaster [12-14], and some other drosophilids [15-17],
and they have features that greatly facilitate the inference
of certain aspects of testicular architecture. The first step in
spermatogenesis involves the division of a spermatogonial (germ line) stem cell and the division of two somatic
stem cells (Fig. 2). During these divisions the mother cells
remain attached to the somatic hub cells and the daughter
cells together form a cyst in which the two somatic cyst
cells jointly enclose the newly formed (transit) germ cell.
The remaining spermatogenesis occurs within this cyst:
the transit cell goes through several rounds of mitotic divisions leading to first spermatocytes (which are also fre-

quently called primary spermatocytes), followed by the
meiotic divisions leading to spermatids, and followed by
spermiogenesis leading to differentiated sperm. The determination of the number of first spermatocytes (F) and
spermatids (S) within a cyst therefore allows to accurately
estimate the number of transit cell divisions nt [18-20]. If
the transit cell divisions correspond to a perfectly bifurcating tree, we would as a general rule expect F = 2 n t and S
= 4 × 2 nt .
Another aspect for which there exists considerable knowledge is for sperm and testis size among members of the
Drosophilidae. Sperm size is usually estimated as sperm
length, which is highly variable within the family [21-23]
and can reach truly gigantic dimensions [24-26]. Because
sperm size trades off with sperm number [22] we can
expect that the number of sperm produced per stem cell is
smaller in species with large sperm. Sperm size may thus
be important for testicular architecture. Furthermore, in
many organisms testis size is expected to correlate with
the total number of sperm produced by the testis, as larger
testes will often have more stem cells. However, in the
Drosophilidae this correlation appears unlikely. Although
testis size is highly variable among different species of the
Drosophilidae [21] this parameter is usually measured as
testis length, which is tightly correlated to sperm length
(relationship without phylogenetic correction, r = 0.94
[27]; relationship with phylogenetic correction, r2 = 0.99
[28]). Within the Drosophilidae it is therefore unlikely
that testis length provides much information on the
number of stem cells in the testis. Only the direct observation of the testicular tip will allow to estimate this parameter [29,30], but there is little published information on
this for drosophilids other than D. melanogaster.
In this study we assemble published data on the number
of first spermatocytes and spermatids per cyst in different
strains and species of the family Drosophilidae, and use
these to estimate the number of transit cell divisions nt.
We further assemble data on sperm size, which we expect
may explain some of the variation in the number of sperm
produced per stem cell, and which may thus be correlated
to nt. We then perform a comparative analysis of independent contrasts using a molecular phylogeny and taxonomic information to correct for the phylogenetic
relationships between the different species.

Methods
Literature data collection
We collected published information on a) the number of
first (or primary) spermatocytes per cyst (i.e. the stage

after all mitotic divisions, F = 2 n t ), b) the number of spermatids per cyst (i.e. the stage after the two meiotic divi-

sions have occurred, S = 4 × 2 n t ), and c) sperm length
(expected to be inversely correlated to the number of
sperm produced per stem cell). We further add data on
sperm length for two species, namely Hirtodrosophila confusa (n = 50 sperm) and D. mercatorum (n = 100 sperm).
For species with heteromorphic sperm we used the length
of the longer sperm morph in the analysis (thereby keeping the comparison within the fertilization-competent
sperm morph, [31,32]). The data and references are listed
in Additional file 1.
Comparative analysis
As the backbone for the comparative analysis we used an
Amyrel-based molecular phylogeny of the family Drosophilidae [33]. However, 14 species for which we had
data were not represented in this molecular phylogeny.
These were added using the taxonomical grouping into
genus, group and subgroup (following the website Taxodros [34]), which in some cases led to polytomies in the
proposed phylogeny. Moreover, one species, D. suzukii,
was not added, because the molecular phylogeny suggested that the suzukii subgroup is polyphyletic (and it was
therefore not clear to which subclade to add it). For the
analysis of evolutionary relationships between the target
variables we used CAIC 2.6.9[35] (available at [36]). For
analyses the values for the number of first spermatocytes
and sperm length were log-transformed. To investigate the
relationship we used a linear regression forced through
the origin, as suggested by the manual of CAIC.

Results
Variation in the number of first spermatocytes
The published literature yields data on the number of first
spermatocytes for 100 species among the Drosophilidae
(Additional file 1), and suggests that the patterns of cell
division during spermatogenesis are a) very variable
within the family (spanning about one order of magnitude), and b) much more variable than the general rule of

F = 2 n t would suggest (Fig. 3). Four independent research
groups report numbers of first spermatocytes (and also
spermatids per cyst) that deviate from this rule. A Japanese
research group screened 78 species within the Drosophilidae, and found a general agreement with the expected
patterns, namely 8, 16, 32, or 64 first spermatocytes produced per cyst in most species [18]. However, several species deviated consistently from this pattern, producing
intermediate numbers of first spermatocytes. Next, a German research group documented extensive variation, not
only within species, but also within individuals of a species [16,19,37]. In Figure 4 we redraw published distributions from D. hydei and D. melanogaster from [19], which

show the kind of variation in the number of first spermatocytes and spermatids per cyst, and the strikingly broad
and bimodal distribution in D. melanogaster. Later the Japanese research group confirmed and extended such observations [20,38], and identified variation in species that
they had initially reported to fit the expected pattern.
Moreover, they were able to document significant variation in the number of first spermatocytes and spermatids
per cyst both within and between different isofemale lines
of D. virilis [39]. More importantly, they showed that
crosses between two of those isofemale lines yielded an
intermediate phenotype, which clearly suggests that heritable genetic variation underlies these traits [40]. It therefore appears likely that testicular architecture can respond
to selection. Finally, recent papers by two other groups
also report and/or confirm deviations the F = 2 n t rule for
several species [28,41].
It is thus clear that these deviations are widespread and it
is important to note that small to intermediate levels of
variation around, and deviations from, the F = 2 n t pattern also occur in species that were initially classified as
fitting the expected pattern, such as in D. melanogaster or
D. simulans [18]. This suggests that there is much more
variation in the number of first spermatocytes than is generally appreciated.
Evolution of the number of first spermatocytes
Most species that we were able to include in the compara-

tive analysis appear to approximately fit the F = 2 n t pattern, but several species show intermediate patterns or
slight deviations (Fig. 5). Considerable variation occurs
within some taxonomic groups (e.g. see the values for the
virilis and repleta species groups), whereas other groups

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/143

seem less variable (e.g. the melanogaster species group).
Overall the number of first spermatocytes significantly covaries with sperm length (Fig. 6A for the relationship
without phylogenetic correction). The comparative analysis of independent contrasts shows that there is a significant evolutionary covariance between sperm length and
the number of first spermatocytes, which is independent
of the phylogenetic relationships between the species (Fig.
6B). Although there appears to be considerable phylogenetic inertia over part of the distribution (as evidenced by
the large number of zeroes for the first spermatocyte contrast), the highest sperm length contrasts are associated
with a reduced number of first spermatocytes per cyst.

Discussion
Variation in the number of first spermatocytes
Our study clearly suggests that the number of first sperma-

tocytes does not always fit the expected F = 2 n t pattern
(Figs. 3 and 4). Two types of deviation are evident. On one
hand there is large inter-specific variation in F (ranging
from 4 to 64 first spermatocytes), with some species having values that are consistently intermediate between two

2 n t levels (e.g. D. bifurca, F = 6; D. pengi, F = 12; Hirtodrosophila alboralis and D. curviceps, F = 24; see also Fig. 3 and
6A).
On the other hand there is considerable intra-specific variation in F (Fig. 4 and Additional file 1). Surprisingly, the
most striking pattern occurs in the best studied species, D.
melanogaster, which shows a very broad bimodal distribution with clear modes at 8 and 16 first spermatocytes (Fig.
4). And although this was reported over 20 years ago [19],
it is not generally appreciated. Almost all major reviews
on D. melanogaster we consulted state that spermatogenesis occurs in a completely synchronous way and always
leads to F = 24 = 16 first spermatocytes and S = 4 × 24 = 64
sperm per cyst [12,13,42,43]. Only one older review [14]
briefly mentions some evidence for 32 instead of 64 spermatids per cyst in D. melanogaster. And while the distribution in D. melanogaster is particularly striking and maybe
unique in its bimodality, there are many species that have
distributions of the type and magnitude of D. hydei, which
we here show as a representative example (Fig. 4). In fact,
most species that were studied in detail, show at least
some level of variation (Additional file 1 gives more
detailed information on this variation).
Some of the data we report were collected using an in vitro
system in which the germ cells undergo partial spermatogenesis [17]. So deviations from the F = 2 n t pattern
could in these cases potentially indicate in vitro artefacts.

Frequency
Frequency distributions of the number of first spermatocytes (F) and spermatids (S) per cyst in D. hydei and D.
melanogaster (redrawn from [19]). Note a) that not all cysts contain the expected F = 2 n t spermatocytes, but that F can
deviate both above and below the expected values by small increments, b) that the number of spermatids per cyst (S) approximately reflects the patterns in F, but that the mode of the two distributions can be somewhat shifted relative to each other,
and c) that in D. melanogaster both the F and S distributions are clearly bimodal.

However, the data for spermatids were collected based on
cross-sections of resin-embedded testes extracted from
adult males, and thus are independent of such potential
artefacts. The good fits between the distributions for first
spermatocytes and spermatids (Fig. 4) suggest that the
deviations from the F = 2 n t pattern are real. This clearly
suggests that, contrary to the general assumption, cell divisions do not have to be completely synchronized within a
cyst.
Interestingly, based on a number of published images of
cysts containing first spermatocytes it appears that all cells
have the same size, even if the particular strain or species
has intermediate numbers of first spermatocytes (e.g. F =
6 in D. bifurca in Fig 1B of [19] or F = 9 in strain A12 of D.
virilis in Fig 1C of [39]). This observation is surprising if
some cells go through fewer or more rounds of cell division than other cells in a cyst. We suggest that the function
of the well known phenomenon of cytoplasmic bridges

between developing spermatocytes and spermatids may
be to allow equalization of the cytoplasm following asynchronous cell division. We thereby add to a growing list of
hypotheses for the function of cytoplasmic bridges, such
as assuring synchronous cell division, nutrient transport,
or avoiding conflict between the father and its sperm
(reviewed in [44,45]).
Evolution of the number of first spermatocytes
One important prerequisite for the evolution of tissue
architecture is that genetic variation exists for traits that
determine the architecture. The general assumption in
most species is that the number of first spermatocytes is
fixed and species-specific. If that were the case it is hard to
imagine how this trait could evolve, because there would
be no heritable variation on which selection could act.
Our results clearly suggest that the number of first spermatocytes F is variable within species and that it does evolve
within the Drosophilidae. However, it is also evident that

the data show a strong stratification into the expected levnt

els of F = 2 (primarily 8,16, or 32 first spermatocytes,
see Fig. 3 and 6A) and there appears to be considerable
phylogenetic inertia, as several species groups show none
or little variation around one of these levels (exceptions
are the virilis and repleta groups, which span two and more

than two levels respectively). However, the current analysis only considers the average or modal F values for the
different species and ignores the sometimes considerable
intra-specific variation. We suspect that more detailed
analyses would reveal further variation in species that are
currently considered to accurately fit the F = 2 n t pattern.

transit cell lineage in the species that produce many small
sperm. So can we conclude that sperm competition plays
a role in this shift? Little is known about the mating system and the intensity of sperm competition in the majority of species we included in our study, and it is still not
entirely clear what the function of the giant sperm is.
However, it is currently thought that the evolution of
sperm length is linked to sexual conflict over the usage of
sperm [46,47], and that it thus represents the outcome of
postcopulatory sexual selection, or more specifically of a
complex interaction between sperm competition and
cryptic female choice. It therefore appears possible that
sexual selection can influence testicular architecture, but
whether it is due to selection on sperm size or sperm
number remains to be tested.

Although one of the earliest comparative studies on the
evolution of testis size [3] reported a potential influence
of sperm competition on the organization of the testis
(i.e. the ratio of spermatogenic tissue to interstitial tissue)
very little data has been collected on such aspects since.
We are aware of only one other study that has looked at
the morphological organization of the testis from a sperm
competition perspective. This comparative study in primates showed considerable variation in spermatogenic
efficiency (i.e. spermatid production per unit of testicular
tissue), but this variation was not related to differences in
the mating system between the studied species [48].

Evidence for a role of sperm competition
The extensive variation in the number of first spermatocytes we report is strongly negatively correlated with
sperm length, which in turn is strongly negatively correlated with the number of sperm produced [22]. This suggests that the testicular architecture shifts towards the

Experimental approaches to study testicular architecture
An interesting avenue for future research would be to
experimentally test the evolvability of testicular architecture by artificially selecting either on the number of first
spermatocytes or on sperm production. Given the variation we describe it is clear that artificial selection on testis
size per se may lead to a different response than selection
on sperm production. Another interesting approach could
be the recent experimental evolution experiment in which
D. melanogaster was grown for many generations under
different levels of sexual selection (i.e. monogamy vs.
polygamy) [49]. This regime appears to have led to a
reduced sperm production by males held under monogamy [50]. So flies from these (or similar) lines could be
used to evaluate if nt or other parameters of testicular
architecture have evolved in response to the selection
regime.

Instead of investigating evolutionary responses one could
also check if there is any phenotypic plasticity in testicular
architecture. One study mentions unpublished results
that suggest that different food levels and temperatures
have no effect on the number of first spermatocytes [40]),
suggesting that it is not phenotypically plastic in response
to these environmental variables. Another study showed
that sperm length varies under different temperature con-

the number of first spermatocytes per cyst.

learn a lot about the evolutionary importance of tissue
architecture.

Phenotypic plasticity in male allocation has been reported
in a number of organisms in response to environmental
cues that indicate future sperm competition risk [52-55].
Such variation in male allocation may lead to different
numbers of sperm produced, and it could therefore be
interesting to test if it also leads to changes in testicular
architecture.

Comparative approaches to study testicular architecture
As outlined above our comparative analysis reveals a
highly significant association between the number of first
spermatocytes and sperm length. Given that we expect
that sperm length (SL) is inversely related to the total
number of sperm (T) produced by a fly [22], we can suggest that at least part of the variation in T is explained by
variation in nt because 1/SL ≈ T = N × k = N × ns × (2n t)2.
However, it appears of course possible that the number of
stem cells (N) and the number of stem cell divisions (ns)
also vary between species, and these will therefore also
have to be estimated for a more complete comparative
analysis. We think that it is possible to do this for the testis
of the Drosophilidae, and that this tissue therefore is an
ideal model organ to test the existing tissue architecture
models [8,10,56]. In Additional file 2 we outline what
data should be collected to more fully parameterize testicular architecture. Moreover, it would be highly relevant to
collect more comparative data on the variation in mating
systems of the different drosophilid species. The recent
sequencing of the genomes of 12 Drosophila species covering a large fraction of the genus Drosophila should facilitate the establishment of microsatellite markers that could
be used on many species within this genus (or maybe even
within the entire Drosophilidae). Such markers would
make it much easier to obtain comparative data on levels
of multiple paternity for a range of species.

Conclusion
Evolutionary biologists have generally treated the testis as
a black box which simply has a size that indicates its
resource use (or reproductive allocation), and a resulting
sperm production that is tailored to the mating system
requirements. So the prevailing idea is that the testis simply responds to varying demands by changing its size.
However, as a consequence of variation in the strength of
sexual selection the testis not only has to produce drastically different numbers of cells, but also cells of highly
variable morphology and complexity. This means that
there are few tissues which are under more variable and
rapidly changing selection pressures than the testis. By
investigating the way in which this organ responds to
these selection pressures, either experimentally or based
on comparative testicular architecture, we can expect to

LS conceived the idea to use the testis as a model organ to
study tissue architecture and DJ contributed the expertise
about drosophilid spermatogenesis. LS and DJ assembled
the comparative data set during a research visit in Gif sur
Yvette. J-LdL provided phylogenetic advice and access to a
then still unpublished molecular phylogeny. LS and DJ
analysed the data and drafted the manuscript during a
research visit in Innsbruck. All authors have critically read
and approved the final manuscript.
