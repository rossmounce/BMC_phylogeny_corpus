Abstract
Background: Receptor-like kinases are a prominent class of surface receptors that regulate many aspects of the plant
life cycle. Despite recent advances the function of most receptor-like kinases remains elusive. Therefore, it is paramount
to investigate these receptors. The task is complicated by the fact that receptor-like kinases belong to a large
monophyletic family with many sub-clades. In general, functional analysis of gene family members by reverse genetics is
often obscured by several issues, such as redundancy, subtle or difficult to detect phenotypes in mutants, or by decision
problems regarding suitable biological and biochemical assays. Therefore, in many cases additional strategies have to be
employed to allow inference of hypotheses regarding gene function.
Results: We approached the function of genes encoding the nine-member STRUBBELIG-RECEPTOR FAMILY (SRF)
class of putative leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases. Sequence comparisons show overall conservation but also
divergence in predicted functional domains among SRF proteins. Interestingly, SRF1 undergoes differential splicing. As a
result, SRF1 is predicted to exist in a standard receptor configuration and in a membrane-anchored receptor-like version
that lacks most of the intracellular domain. Furthermore, SRF1 is characterised by a high degree of polymorphism
between the Ler and Col accessions. Two independent T-DNA-based srf4 mutants showed smaller leaves while 35S::SRF4
plants displayed enlarged leaves. This is in addition to the strubbelig phenotype which has been described before.
Additional single and several key double mutant combinations did not reveal obvious mutant phenotypes. Ectopic
expression of several SRF genes, using the 35S promoter, resulted in male sterility. To gain possible insights into SRF gene
function we employed a computational analysis of publicly available microarray data. We performed global expression
profiling, coexpression analysis, and an analysis of the enrichment of gene ontology terms among coexpressed genes. The
bioinformatic analyses raise the possibility that some SRF genes affect different aspects of cell wall biology. The results
also indicate that redundancy is a minor aspect of the SRF family.
Conclusion: The results provide evidence that SRF4 is a positive regulator of leaf size. In addition, they suggest that the
SRF family is characterised by functional diversity and that some SRF genes may function in cell wall biology. They also
indicate that complementing reverse genetics with bioinformatical data mining of genome-wide expression data aids in
inferring hypotheses on possible functions for members of a gene family.

Background
Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) constitute a prominent class
of receptors that transmit a signal across a membrane. The
years since the first isolation of a plant RLK [1] have witnessed a great increase in knowledge regarding the function of plant RLKs. RLKs are required for cellular
communication in many processes during the plant's life
cycle, regulating aspects of development, defense, and
physiology [2-6]. The importance of RLKs in plants is
emphasized by the observation that RLKs constitute about
2.5% of the Arabidopsis protein coding sequences [7,8].
Moreover, greater than 200 RLKs belong to the leucinerich repeat (LRR) class of RLKs typified by varying numbers of LRRs in their extracellular domain. LRRs are
involved in protein-protein interactions and are found in
numerous types of proteins [9]. Presently, the biological
roles of only a handful of RLKs are known. Thus, one
important task consists of gaining information about the
functions of the remaining plant RLKs.
The functional analysis of genes encoding RLKs is often
complicated due to redundancy issues. For example, during early anther development there are repeated requirements for position-dependent intercellular signaling
events mediated by discrete sets of redundantly acting
LRR-RLKs. The development of the tapetum and the differentiation of microspores depend on the function of
several LRR-RLK genes. Analysis of mutations in a single
gene, encoding the LRR-X class LRR-RLK EXCESS MICROSPOROCYTES 1/EXTRA SPOROGENOUS CELLS (EXS/
EMS) [10,11] revealed a role for EXS/EMS in these aspects
of anther development. Anthers of exs/ems mutants fail to
form a tapetum and show an increased number of aberrantly developing pollen mother cells. Further, SOMATIC
EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (SERK1) and
SERK2 encode two homologous LRR-RLKs of the LRR-II
class [12,13] that are coexpressed during early anther
development. While serk1 and serk2 single mutants both
exhibit a wild-type anther morphology, the serk1 serk2
double mutants resemble exs/ems single mutants [12,13].
This finding suggests functionally redundant roles for
SERK1 and SERK2 in processes that also depend on EXS/
EMS function. Interestingly, translational fusions of
SERK1 and SERK2 to variants of green fluorescent protein
can form homo- and heterodimers in a cell culture system,
indicating that SERK1/SERK2 may act in the same protein
complex [12]. Another early aspect of anther development
is the asymmetric cell division of archesporial cells and
the differentiation of primary parietal and primary sporogenous cells. This process is effected by BARELY ANY
MERISTEM (BAM1) and BAM2 [14]. BAM1 and BAM2 are
members of a gene family encoding LRR-RLKs, that, in
addition to BAM1 and BAM2, includes CLAVATA1
(CLV1) and BAM3 [15].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/16

The examples described above represent relatively
straightforward cases of functional redundancy, where
very similar genes are co-expressed in the same tissue and
are likely to functionally substitute for each other. Conversely, there are also known instances where a diversification of function has taken place in evolution, largely
through alterations in gene expression patterns between
closely related LRR-RLK genes. This can result in a combination of partially overlapping and partially separate
functions.
For example, signal transduction involving brassinosteroids (BRs) plays an important role in cell elongation and
differentiation
[16,17].
BRASSINOSTEROID
INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) encodes a LRR-RLK that constitutes
a key component of a BR receptor complex [18-20]. The
Arabidopsis genome contains several close relatives of
BRI1: the BRI1-like genes BRL1, BRL3 and VASCULAR
HIGHWAY1 (VH1)/BRL2 [18,21-23]. VH1 does not bind
BR but is required for the maintenance of provascular differentiation [21,22]. BRI1, BRL1 and BRL3 encode proteins that share the capacity to bind BR [20,22]. The three
genes, however, differ in their expression patterns and
there is a shift of emphasis regarding their functions.
While BRI1 is expressed in a broad fashion, BRL1 and
BRL3 are predominantly expressed in a complementary
pattern in vascular tissue [18,20,22-24]. In accordance
with its expression pattern, BRI1 exerts a broad function in
cell elongation and differentiation, which includes the
differentiation of vascular tissue. BRL1 and BRL3 can fully
substitute for BRI1 [22,23]. However, BRL1 and BRL3 are
mainly required for vascular differentiation, whereby synergistic interactions of BRI1 with BRL1 and BRL3 are
required for regular vascular development [22]. A similarly complex behavior is exhibited by the small group of
genes encoding ERECTA (ER) and ERECTA-LIKE1 (ERL1)
and ERL2 LRR-RLKs that regulate organ size and stomata
development [25-27].
The LRR-class of RLKs has been subdivided into several
classes (LRRI-LRR-XIII) [7]. We are interested in the LRRV/STRUBBELIG-RECEPTOR FAMILY (SRF) gene family
encoding putative LRR-RLKs [7]. This monophyletic family is represented by STRUBBELIG (SUB) and eight additional members. SUB was originally identified in a screen
for mutants with a defect in ovule development [28]. In
more recent work it was shown that SUB encodes a putative LRR-RLK of central importance to the plant as it
affects cellular morphogenesis in a number of different
organs [29]. In particular, SUB is required for the orientation of the cell division plane and the control of cell
number, cell size and cell shape. Furthermore, SUB, also
known as SCRAMBLED (SCM), affects root hair specification [30,31]. A combination of biochemical and genetic
evidence suggests that phosphotransfer activity of the

kinase domain is not essential for SUB protein function
[29]. Thus, SUB is likely to represent an atypical or "dead"
RLK [32]. In this paper we report on the initial molecular
and functional characterisation of the other members of
the SRF gene family.

Results
The LRR-V/SRF gene family encodes putative LRR-RLKs
SUB belongs to LRR-V family of Arabidopsis LRR-RLKs
[7]. Further database searches failed to identify additional
family members in Arabidopsis. Thus, the LRR-V family
encompasses 9 different representatives encoded by genes
that are located throughout the genome. We coined the
term STRUBBELIG-RECEPTOR FAMILY (SRF) and named
the individual family members SRF1 to SRF8 [33]. SUB
would be SRF9 but retained its original name (Table 1).
SRF members also relate to the ltk gene family of
unknown function from corn [34]. We compared the
genomic coordinates of SRF genes to investigate whether
some pairs are located in segments derived from the
youngest large-scale duplication event in Arabidopsis
[35]. The pairs SRF1/SRF3, SRF4/SRF5 and SRF6/SRF7
were found as segmentally duplicated pairs while SUB,
SRF2 and SRF8 were not located in duplicated regions. We
isolated tentative full-length cDNAs of all members (see
Methods) to characterize the intron-exon organisation of
the SRF genes (Figure 1). During this work it became clear
that all SRF genes carried incorrect annotations in the Arabidopsis database. The reannotation information was
submitted to the MIPS Arabidopsis database [36] and to
TAIR [37].

With one distinction regarding SRF1 (see below), conceptual translation of the SRF genes suggests that they encode
putative LRR-RLKs with an extra-cellular domain (ECD), a
transmembrane domain (TM), an intracellular juxtamembrane domain (JM), an intracellular catalytic or kinase
domain (CD), and in some cases, an extended C-terminus
(Figures 2, 3A, 3B). At the amino acid level, predicted SRF
members exhibit variable degrees of conservation ranging
from 32.5 % identity to 77.9% identity (Table 2) and fall
into distinct subclades (Figure 4) [7]. The predicted SRF
proteins share an overall domain organisation. The ECDs
of the LRR-V family are characterised by a stretch of 59 to
60 conserved residues representing the SUB-domain and
located just N-terminal to six LRRs [29]. The role of the
SUB domain is unknown. At least for SUB, however, the
SUB-domain appears to be functionally relevant as the
sub-3 allele results in an amino acid substitution at a conserved position in the SUB domain (V64M) [29].
The part of the ECD region that is flanked by the last LRRrepeat and the TM domain varies between the different
SRF members. In case of SRF2 this region encompasses 67
residues (residues 228–294). Several SRF members fea-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/16

ture particular regional distinctions in the central part of
this domain (roughly residues 245 to 270 of SRF2). SRF1,
SRF3, and SUB carry insertions in this region ranging from
eight residues (SRF1) to 44 residues (SUB) while SRF4 and
SRF5 each feature an identical deletion of 14 amino acids.
This central part is also enriched in proline residues, particularly in SUB but also in SRF1, SRF3, SRF6 and SRF7. In
the case of SRF3 an additional proline-rich domain is also
located before the kinase domain.
The JM is variable among the family members. The kinase
domains of the SRF proteins have the hallmarks of typical
protein kinases [38] (Figure 3B). A more detailed comparison of the kinase domains, however, indicates that there
are notable differences in a stretch of residues flanked by
kinase subdomains II and III, a region known to be variable betweeen different protein kinases [38,39], and in the
activation segment. The kinase subdomains II and III are
required for the binding of ATP and the activation segment is important for substrate binding [40,41]. SUB,
SRF2 and SRF8 feature unique activation segment
sequences. This domain is more conserved within the
SRF1/3, SRF6/7, and to some extent SRF4/5, pairs. The
activation segment sequences of the individual pairs,
however, are again distinct from each other and the other
LRRV family activation segment sequences. This finding
indicates that there may be considerable diversity in substrate recognition among family members, and therefore
diversity in function. The findings also leave open possible redundant functions of members of the three more
conserved pairs (but see also below).
The carboxy-termini (C-termini) of the SRF members represent another domain of diversity. SRF2 has the longest
C-terminus (40 residues) while SUB and SRF4 lack such
C-termini. In contrast, SRF5, the closest homolog of SRF4,
features a 23 residue extension. Furthermore, only the first
13 amino acids of the SRF6 and SRF7 extensions are conserved. Interestingly, distinct serines in the C-termini of
SRF7 and SRF8 (Figure 3B) are phosphorylated in an Arabidopsis suspension culture system [42].
SRF1 undergoes differential splicing
During the full-length cDNA isolation experiments we
noticed that SRF1 undergoes differential splicing resulting
in two mRNA species: one lacks intron 10 (SRF1A), the
other carries intron 10 (SRF1B) (Figure 1). The differential
splicing event occurs in both Ler and Col indicating that it
is not related to the observed SRF1 Ler/Col polymorphisms (see below). Differential splicing of SRF1 was
observed in all tissues tested. We could not detect splicing
variants for the other SRF members in RT-PCR experiments using primer pairs flanking the equivalent intron.
Full-length SRF1A and SRF1B cDNA species were generated from RNA isolated from stage 1–12 flowers (see

Methods). Conceptual translation indicates that the two
SRF1 variants share the ECD and the TM but differ in their
intracellular domains. Thus, SRF1 is likely to encode two
proteins: a LRR-RLK (SRF1A) and a membrane-anchored
LRR receptor-like protein (LRR-RLP) (SRF1B) that lacks
most of the intracellular domain. Prominent examples of
genes encoding membrane-anchored LRR-RLPs include
CLAVATA2 (CLV2), TOO MANY MOUTHS (TMM) or
RPP27 from Arabidopsis and Cf-9 from tomato [43-46].
SRF1 is characterised by a high degree of polymorphism
between the Ler and Col accessions
The sub phenotype in above-ground tissues is much less
prominent in the Col background [29]. An initial genetic
analysis indicated the existence of a genetic modifier,
located on the second chromosome and linked to the
ERECTA (ER) locus (D. C. and K.S., unpublished observations). SRF1 is located on chromosome 2 within a short
distance to ER. Thus, we tested whether or not there is
noteworthy polymorphism in the SRF1 sequence when
comparing the Ler and Col accessions. We did observe an
unusual amount of polymorphisms in SRF1 (Tables 3 and
4, Figure 5) although subsequent studies indicated that
SRF1 is not the modifier (unpublished results, see also
below). We sequenced genomic DNA of the Ler SRF1
locus spanning nucleotides 8982429 to 8986460 (numbers as in Col) and we sequenced full-length cDNAs
obtained from mRNA isolated from Ler and Col accessions (see Materials and Methods). Within the 3.986 kb of
SRF1 genomic sequence covering the coding sequence we
observed a total of 78 Ler/Col polymorphisms or about 20
polymorphisms per 1 kb. This is in contrast to the average
number of polymorphisms between two accessions which
is about 4 polymorphisms per 1 kb genomic DNA across
all sequence types and somewhat lower in coding regions
[47].

Out of these 78 polymorphisms 68 correspond to simple
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 10 to small inser-

tions/deletions (indels). The indels encompass 5 insertions (from 2 to 6 bp) and 5 deletions (from 1 to 6 bp).
Eight indels are located in introns, and two deletions are
found in the 3' UTR. Of the SNPs, 18 are located in
introns, two are present in the 5' UTR, one is located in the
3' UTR, and 47 SNPs are present in exons. The other SRF
genes do not exhibit similarly elevated levels of polymorphisms between Ler and Col (B. E., A. F. and K. S., unpublished observations; R. Clark and D. Weigel, pers.
communication).
The polymorphisms are not equally distributed along
SRF1. At the nucleotide level about 21% of the polymorphisms are located in the region encoding the ECD
whereas 79% are found in the intracellular domain. At the
predicted protein level, 23 of the 25 non-synonymous residue changes map to the intracellular domain (Figure 5,
Table 4), with the JM featuring 10 amino acid alterations
and the kinase domain 12 changes. This finding suggests
that the polymorphisms affect, in particular, SRF1A. It is
unclear if the polymorphisms influence protein function.
Many of those nucleotide polymorphisms may do so as
they alter the predicted protein sequence. Of the nucleotide polymorphisms located in exons, 26 result in amino
acid changes of which at least six result in residues with
different chemical and spatial properties. However, only
one such alteration, a change from proline (Col) to leucine (Ler) at position 600 in SRF1A and situated just
between kinase subdomains VIa and VIb, affects a residue
strictly conserved between SRF proteins (Figure 3B). The
other polymorphisms reside at positions occupied by
amino acids that are not conserved or only partially conserved among the SRF proteins.
Functional analysis of SRF genes
SRF gene function was assayed by analysing the morphology of several independently isolated T-DNA insertion
lines for each SRF gene. In addition, we tested srf1 srf3, srf4
srf5, and srf6 srf7 double mutants (for a detailed descrip-

were grown on soil in a greenhouse and scored in a systematic fashion for phenotypes at various developmental
stages (see Methods).

Plants with altered SRF4 activity show a phenotype that
indicates that SRF4 plays a role in the regulation of leaf
size (Figure 6G, Table 5). We noticed that about 80% of
homozygous mutant plants of two independent T-DNA
insertion lines, srf4-2 and srf4-3, exhibited a reduction in
leaf size. Leaf blade dimensions were measured using as

standard the fifth rosette leaves [48] taken from different
16-days-old plants grown simultaneously and under similar conditions. Both alleles showed an approximate 20%
reduction in the length and width of the leaf blade. This
translates to a decrease of 40% in the surface area of the
leaf blade. Interestingly, transgenic wild-type Col plants
ectopically expressing SRF4 using the 35S promoter of
cauliflower mosaic virus [49] exhibited leaves of increased
size. We tested five transgenic lines with enlarged leaves
and those lines exhibited elevated levels of transgene
expression (not shown). Two independent homozygous
35S::SRF4 lines were characterized further (T3 generation,
lines 3–12 and 1–5, respectively). We noted a 25–30%
increase in length and width of the leaf blade, translating
into a 40–50% increase in the surface area of the leaf
blade. Interestingly, leaf shape appeared about normal in
srf4 and 35S::SRF4 plants. This is also indicated by the
constant length/width ratios of leaf blades across the two
types of mutants and the wild type (Table 5).
Taken together these findings provide genetic evidence
that SRF4 is a direct positive regulator of leaf size. The
basis of the slightly reduced penetrance in the two srf4
mutants is unclear. The insertions in both srf4 alleles
reside in exons encoding part of the extracellular domain
of SRF4. In particular, srf4-2 is predicted to carry only a
very short form of the ECD (Figure 1). It is therefore
unlikely that residual SRF4 function in srf4-2 accounts for
the reduction in penetrance. It is also unlikely that partial
compensation of SRF4 function by its closest relative SRF5
explains the reduced penetrance of the leaf size phenotype
in srf4 mutants. The analysed mutant alleles of SRF5, srf51 and srf5-2, apparently looked normal, transgenic
35S::SRF5 plants did not exhibit noticably bigger leaves,
and srf4-2 srf5-1 double mutants essentially resembled
srf4-2 single mutants (not shown). Thus, the results suggest that the reduced penetrance of the srf4 phenotype
relates to other, as yet unknown factors.
Apart from srf4 mutants, all other T-DNA-induced
mutants exhibited apparent wild-type morphology. We
could also detect no obvious differences from wild type
when light-grown mutant plants were tested for germina-

tion behavior and root growth defects on 0.5× MS agar
plates, supplemented with 1% sucrose. As previously
reported, the sub phenotype is much more pronounced in
the Ler background compared to Col [29]. As the T-DNA
insertion lines are Col-derived, individual srf T-DNA alleles were crossed into a Ler background (see Methods).
Again, apart from the defects in srf4 plants, we could
detect no additional phenotypes/defects in srf mutants.
The lack of phenotypes could be in part due to the fact
that the T-DNA insertions in those lines only lead to an
incomplete loss of SRF function. We could detect transcripts in all tested T-DNA lines when using primers (Figure 1) directed to a position located 3' to the T-DNA
integration site (not shown). In the case of SRF1-5, however, at least one line had a T-DNA insertion situated in an
exon encoding part of the ECD indicating that those insertions should severly impair protein function. The situation is less clear for the insertions in SRF6-8. The insertion
sites in srf6-2 and srf6-4 are located within 50 base pairs 5'
to the start of the SRF6 coding region. The insertion site of
srf8-2 resides in the 5' UTR. Therefore, the observed transcript levels could result in sufficient SRF6 and SRF8 activity. The insertion sites in srf7-2 and srf7-3 are located in
introns. In both lines correctly spliced mRNA molecules
could be detected by RT-PCR using primers flanking the
intron carring the insertion (Figure 1) (not shown) again
leaving the possibility that sufficient SRF7 activity is
present in those T-DNA insertion lines.
To gain further indications as to the function of individual
SRF genes transgenic plants were generated that ectopically express SRF1A, SRF1B and SRF2-8 cDNAs under the
control of the 35S promoter. Again Ler and Col wild-type
backgrounds were used and transgenic plants were
assayed for transgene expression (see Methods). No obvious phenotypes were detected in plants carrying
35S::SRF1B or 35S::SRF6 constructs. In contrast,
35S::SRF2/3/5/7 plants (Col), while otherwise normal in
appearance, exhibited sterility (at least 5/50 transgenic
plants; Figure 6). The 35S::SRF4 plants (Col) also showed
sterility in addition to the leaf-size phenotype outlined
above. Closer analysis of open flowers revealed all five different transgenic plants to carry mature anthers that in the

DNA insertion lines it is presently difficult to decide
whether or not the sterility exhibited by some of the
35S::SRF transgenic plants relates to the wild-type function of the corresponding gene. A similar restriction
applies to the seedling lethality.

most extreme cases failed to produce any visible pollen,
while ovules appeared normal. Pollinating sterile plants
with wild-type pollen resulted in normal seed production
indicating that such plants were male-sterile (data not
shown). In the case of different 35S::SRF4, 35S::SRF5, and
35S::SRF7 lines the sterility correlated with increased
transgene expression while for 35S::SRF2 and 35S::SRF3
lines no strict correlation could be detected (not shown).
In the Ler background only ectopic expression of SRF3
and SRF4 led to male sterility, indicating the importance
of genetic background in these experiments.
The situation for 35S::SRF1A and 35S::SRF8 plants was
more complex. We noticed that the majority of resistant
T1 seedlings failed to generate rosette leaves. The seedlings featured cotyledons, stayed green for several weeks
and then died (B.E., data not shown). This finding was
observed in Ler and Col backgrounds and indicates that
ectopic expression of SRF1A and SRF8 may lead to seedling lethality. Conversely, viable transgenic 35S::SRF1A
and 35S::SRF8 plants, that also expressed the transgene,
were isolated. These plants showed no apparent mutant
phenotype. The basis for the discrepancy is presently not
understood. Unfortunately, due to the apparently normal
anther development and fertility in the different srf T-

To test if different SRF genes could substitute for SUB
function we generated separate sub-1 plant lines, where
each line was transgenic for one of the individual nine
35S::SRF constructs. While at least 50 transgenic sub-1
35S::SRF T1 plants were screened per construct, no rescue
of the sub-1 phenotype was observed. Seedling lethality, as
described above, for sub-1 35S::SRF1A and sub-1
35S::SRF8 plants was again present, however, again several viable sub-1 35S::SRF1A and sub-1 35S::SRF8 plants
expressing the transgene were isolated (see Methods).
These plants showed a sub-1 phenotype. As the sub-1 phenotype disappears in sub-1 35S::SUB plants [29] our
results suggest that SRF1-8 cannot functionally replace
SUB in this genetic assay.
Global gene expression analysis
RT-PCR analysis (Figure 7) indicated that most SRF transcripts are present in a broad pattern. SRF5 expression
may be the exception, as its expression levels are not easily
detectable by RT-PCR, in siliques, stems, roots and seedlings. To analyse the expression profiles of SRF genes at a
global scale, including many developmental stages and
experimental conditions, we made use of a large set of
GeneChip expression data publicly available at The Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC) [50,51] (see
Methods). The data set used comprises 1784 Affymetrix
chips (ATH1 platform) and more than 100 experiments
covering a wide range of tissues, developmental stages and
environmental conditions. Probe sets of the ATH1 GeneChip were realigned to the Arabidopsis whole genome
sequence to exclude non-unique probes. All SRF genes
including SUB are described by specific probe sets (see
Methods). The experimental set up did not allow a discrimination between SRF1A and SRF1B. By interrogating
this dataset we targeted two objectives: to assay possible
functional redundancy between SRF genes and to formulate hypotheses regarding the function of individual SRF
genes.

Correlation analysis of SRF transcript levels
Is there redundancy between SRF genes, such that an
active SRF gene (or several SRF genes) could functionally
replace the mutated SRF gene? If so, one expects at least
some co-expression of the redundant genes. Therefore, we
performed a global correlation analysis of SRF transcript
levels. Pearson correlation coefficients were determined
for each SRF pair (Table 6). To compare the SRF correlations against random expectation, we computed allagainst-all gene pairs correlations of all genes present on
the ATH1 chip (excluding self-correlations) to derive
background expression similarities. Correlations were calculated as (metric) Pearson correlation coefficients. Mean
and median of background distribution are rMean = 0.08
and rMedian = 0.05 and the 80%-, 95%- and 99%-quantiles
are 0.51, 0.71 and 0.92, respectively. For all SRF pairs, global correlations are considerably below the 0.95%-quantile and, except for SRF4 and SRF5, even below the 80%quantile (see Table 6). Thus, with the possible exception
of SRF4/SRF5, global expression correlations provide no
support for strong redundancies between SRF genes but
indicate instead at least partially specific expression patterns.
Expression profiling of SRF genes
One way to gain further leads into possible gene function
is to ask whether or not a particular gene is up- or downregulated at certain developmental stages or under certain
experimental conditions. To investigate expression of SRF
genes in detail, SRF expression levels were analysed for
each experiment in the ATH1 GeneChip dataset. Replicates were summarized by their mean. Measurements
were scaled such that expression levels for each chip had a
mean of 0.0 and a variance of 1.0. Expression profiles for
the SRF genes are shown in Figure 8. SRF gene expression
is present over a wide range of experiments and most of
them show, at least for particular experiments, specific
profiles. This corroborates the analysis of global expression correlations and conclusions about partly independent functionalities of SRF genes.

SUB generally has expression levels below average. It displays accented expression levels in two large developmental series. In both series, shoot apices at the bolting stage
have elevated SUB levels. In contrast, SRF1 profile exhibits
several distinct gene inductions or repressions in experiments investigating programmed cell death, tumor development, control of lignification and pectin biosynthesis.
SRF2 shows an overall low and unspecific broad expression. As expected from their global correlations, SRF4 and
SRF5 show the highest similarity in their profiles, with
SRF5 having remarkably lower expression levels. Both
genes appear to exhibit highly pronounced expression in
mature pollen. It is possible, however, that the seemingly
high levels of pollen expression in the GeneChip data set
represents an artefact originating from the normalisation
procedure as only 26% of the genes present on the ATH1
chip were detected in pollen samples while about 55% to
67% of the genes were detected in samples from most
other tissues [51,52]. In this context it is interesting to
note that srf4 mutants show altered leaf development but
no apparent defect in pollen development or fertility. In
addition, srf5 single mutants, and srf4 srf5 double
mutants, show apparently normal pollen and are fertile
plants. We could not confirm a notably strong expression
of SRF4 and SRF5 in pollen using in situ hybridisation
experiments as in our hands pollen regularly show
increased background signals in such experiments (K.
Pfister and K. Schneitz, unpublished observations).
Although we did not perform quantitative experiments,
the results from our RT-PCR analysis may indicate, however, that expression of both genes is perhaps more readily
detected in developing flowers in comparison with many
other tissues (Figure 7).
In contrast to the previous genes, expression profiles of
SRF3, SRF6, SRF7, and SRF8 exhibit above average or high
expression levels over a broad range of experiments. For
these genes, we therefore describe only the most salient
experiments, i.e. with the highest expression levels
(arrows in Figure 8, NASC codes are given in the figure legend). The strongest expression levels of SRF3 are concord-

observed for SRF6, both SRF7 and SRF8 showed prominent expression in experiments analyzing effects on transcription for sulfate limitations and for the rhd2 mutant in
Arabidopsis. In addition, the expression profile of SRF7
showed elevated levels in experiments involving various
brassinosteroid treatments.
In summary, although expression profiles showed overlapping domains between various SRF genes, an experiment-wide analysis of expressions corroborates our
previous conclusions. That is, genetic redundancy, in the
sense that at least some SRF genes are functionally interchangeable, is likely not a major cause for the lack of phenotypes in srf mutants.

programmed cell death, pectin biosynthesis, control of
lignification and tumor development. In contrast to SRF1,
however, SRF3 shows mid-level expressions in many
other experiments. SRF6 was strongly induced in plants
exposed for a prolonged time (3 h) to heat stress. Considerably elevated expression levels for SRF6 were also
observable for several light treatments, brassinosteroid
treatments and pectin biosynthesis. Furthermore, strong
inductions of SRF6 were present in experiments analyzing
expression in the Atrbohc/rhd2 mutant [53] and infections
with fungi inducing arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis. As

Enrichment of functional categories
Previous reports have shown that co-expressed genes have
an increased likelihood to be involved in a common biological process [51,54-56]. Coexpression information can
therefore be used to transfer knowledge from annotated
genes to genes of unknown function. We extended our
expression correlation analysis to compare individual SRF
expression levels with the expression levels of all Arabidopsis genes included on the ATH1 chip. Gene ontology
(GO) annotations for Arabidopsis genes (GO slim) were
obtained from TAIR [37,57]. From the all-against-all
matrix of Pearson correlations, we selected the top 100
(0.5%) correlated genes for each SRF gene. Overrepresentation of particular functional categories within each of
these gene sets were tested by binomial probability. P-values were Bonferroni-corrected for multiple hypothesis
testing. Corrected p-values of p ≤ 0.05 were considered
significant. Table 7 lists the detected functional categories
for the different SRF genes.

Curiously, our analysis detected only for SRF4, but not for
SRF5, a statistically significant enrichment for several
functional categories. This result is somewhat surprising
as both genes have a similar expression profile. Both profiles mainly differ in expression levels corresponding to
their expression in mature pollen tissue while for most
other experiments, both genes show basal or background

expression levels. The relatively small number of pronounced or informative expression peaks for this gene
pair could influence our statistical test due to many small
fluctuations from noise or background expression. Therefore, in our current analysis, it is not clear whether differences between SRF4 and SRF5 truly reflect different
biological roles or may be due to an insufficient resolution/power of our approach. However, we were able to
detect significant enrichments for GO annotations within
their correlated genes for SRF3, SRF4, and SRF6-8. As
expected, GO terms describing kinase signaling pathways
were overrepresented in several gene sets. The set of SRF3
was enriched in Golgi-associated processes and the set of
SRF4 in processes regulating pectinesterase activity. SRF6
is potentially acting in pathways responding to fungal
infections. SRF7 shows a strong association with proteins
involved in the organization and biogenesis of the cell
wall while SRF8 may act in sterol biosynthesis.

Discussion
Differential splicing at the SRF1 locus
We found that differential splicing of the SRF1 transcript
potentially leads to two types of proteins: a LRR-RLK
(SRF1A) and a membrane-anchored LRR-RLP (SRF1B).
Genes encoding putative RLPs represent a large family in
plants [8,58]. As a rule, RLKs and RLPs are encoded by
separate genes in plants [8,58]. Thus, SRF1 is unusual as
the RLK and RLP versions of SRF1 appear to be generated
by differential splicing. In this respect, however, it resembles for example the Brassica gene encoding S-locus receptor kinase (SRK) from the S3 and S9 haplotypes [59,60].
Differential splicing of SRK in those haplotypes results in
multiple transcrips, one of which encodes the SRK while
another encodes a soluble protein, carrying the ECD but
not the TM or intracellular domain (eSRK).

The function of most plant RLPs is unknown [8,58]. To
date, RLPs are known to affect processes as diverse as meristem regulation, stomata development, self-incompatibility, or pathogen resistance [43-46,61-63]. Interestingly,
RLPs such as Xa21D, CLV2, TMM, or the S-locus glycoprotein (SLG) of Brassica, may affect the same process regulated by a RLK with a related ECD. For example, the LRRRLK Xa21 and the extracellular LRR-RLP Xa21D confer the
same resistance spectrum to Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae,
albeit with different strengths [63-65]. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that the membrane-anchored
LRR-RLP CLV2 acts in the same pathway than the LRRRLK CLV1 and that CLV2 and CLV1 form a complex
[43,66,67]. In addition, there is genetic evidence that the
membrane-anchored LRR-RLP TMM functions in the stomatal patterning process regulated by members of the
ERECTA family of LRR-RLKs [26]. The Brassica self-incompatibility protein SLG occurs in different forms but is generally an extracellular protein with an S-domain highly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/16

homologous to the S-domain of SRK [68,69]. The exact
function of SLG is still under debate [68,69], however,
there is evidence that in certain S-haplotypes SLG is part
of a protein complex that includes SRK [70,71]. SLG
enhances the self-incompatibility response in some Shaplotypes [72] and one function of SLG may reside in
the stabilisation of SRK [73].
Whether or not SRF1A and SRF1B act in the same protein
complex remains to be investigated. In this context it is
interesting to note that SRF1A may differ from SRF1B in
its biological activity as indicated by the presence of seedling lethality exhibited by some 35S::SRF1A plants, but
not by 35S::SRF1B plants. Thus, differential splicing at the
SRF1 locus may result in two SRF1 protein variants with
distinct biochemical and possibly biological properties.
SRF1 exhibits high levels of Ler/Col polymorphisms
A high number of polymorphisms were found when comparing SRF1 sequences between Col and Ler. Several Arabidopsis genes exhibit such elevated levels of
polymorphisms. These include a large number of nucleotide-binding site plus leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR)
genes, a domain organisation characteristic of many plant
resistance (R) genes [74-76], but also developmental regulators such as APETALA 3 (AP3), CAULIFLOWER (CAL)
[77,78], or CLV2 [43].

Most R genes of the NBS-LRR class are organised in single
units, clusters, and superclusters [76]. R genes are
involved in gene-for-gene interactions [79,80]. The presence of a specific allelic variant of an R gene and a corresponding specific avirulence allele from the pathogen in
both host and pathogen results in disease resistance. In
the case of NBS-LRR-class R proteins the C-terminal LRRs
are likely to be important for the specificity of R protein
and avirulence protein interaction. In accordance with
this view, such R genes are characterized by high variability in the LRR-coding regions and population genetic
analysis indicates that balanced selection acts to maintain
resistant and susceptible alleles [81-86]. Interestingly, the
CLV2 polymorphisms affect mainly the N-terminal LRRs
in the ECD [43], which are likely to be involved in ligand
binding.
Whether or not SRF1 is under balancing selection remains
to be seen. The large number of SRF1 polymorphisms is
evident in a Ler/Col comparison. SRF1 does not appear to
diverge much from Col in several other accessions (R.
Clark and D. Weigel, pers. communication). In addition,
SRF1 is not situated in a generally polymorphic genomic
region although the neighbouring locus At2g20840 also
exhibits elevated levels of Ler/Col polymorphisms (R.
Clark and D. Weigel, pers. communication). At2g20840
encodes a protein annotated as a secretory carrier mem-

brane protein (SCAMP) possibly acting in endocytosis. It
should also be noted that the allele is rare and if under
balancing selection, is maintained at very low frequency.
The Ka/Ks ratio, the ratio of nonsynonymous over synonymous amino acid substitutions, may point to an influence
of balancing selection. A ratio exceeding unity is compatible with balanced selection. Taking the entire SRF1 protein into account, the Ka/Ks ratio is 1.25 (25 non-

synonymous/20 synonymous amino acid substitutions).
In addition, the asynonymous changes are mainly concentrated in a particular region of SRF1. Considering the
ECD and the intracellular domain (JM/CD/C-terminus)
separately, one observes values of 0.29 and 1.85, respectively (Table 4). Thus, and in contrast to CLV2, the SRF1
polymorphisms mainly affect the intracellular domains of
the predicted SRF1 proteins.

SRF4 is required for the control of leaf size
The genetic results presented in this paper suggest that
SRF4 is a direct positive regulator of leaf size but not leaf
shape. Organ size depends on the coordination of cell
proliferation and cell size [87-90]. It is poorly understood
how this coordination is regulated and only few genes are
known that when overexpressed cause altered organ size
but do not interfere with differentiation. Such genes are
postulated to be involved in the control of an organ-size
checkpoint [89,91]. One key element in organ size control
is the positive regulation of the duration of cell proliferation during organ development (meristematic competence of organ cells). The current evidence suggests that
auxin, in an AUXIN-RESISTANT1-dependent fashion,
upregulates transcription of the ARGOS gene encoding a
protein of unknown biochemical function [92]. Plants
that exhibit reduced or ectopic expression of ARGOS show
reduced or enlarged aerial organs, respectively. ARGOS
mediates its effects through AINTEGUMENTA (ANT)
[92]. ANT encodes a member of the AP2/EREBP class of
transcription factors [93-95]. Plants with altered ARGOS
or ANT activities share many similarities and ARGOS acts
as a positive regulator of ANT expression [92]. Plants with
reduced ANT activity show a number of defects including
a variably reduced floral organ number, narrow floral
organs and reduced ovule primordium and integument
outgrowth [28,93,94,96,97]. In contrast, ectopic expression of ANT leads to leaves and floral organs, including
ovules, with increased size and normal shape [91,98].
ANT largely influences the final number of cells in an
organ and in turn mediates its function in part through
cell cycle regulators such as CycD3;1 [91,99].

With respect to leaves recent evidence suggests that distinct processes regulate cell proliferation and cell expansion along the longitudinal (proximal-distal) and lateral
(transverse) axes, respectively [100]. In addition, the plate
meristem of leaf primordia sustains two-dimensional
growth of leaf blades as lamina cells divide in random
directions [101]. Two genes, ANGUSTUFOLIA3 (AN3)
and GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR5 (AtGRF5), are
implicated as positive regulators of cell proliferation in

the plate meristem [102]. AtGRF5 encodes a putative transcription factor [103]. AN3 is identical to GRF-INTERACTING FACTOR1 (AtGIF1) [104]. AN3/AtGIF1 encodes a
homolog of the animal transcriptional coactivator SYT
and AN3/ATGIF1 can dimerise with ATGRF5 in yeast
[102]. Plants defective in AN3/AtGIF1 function exhibit a
reduction in leaf cells due to decreasing plate meristem
activity. Loss-of-function mutations in AtGRF5 lead to
similar, though milder effects. By contrast, ectopic expression of AN3/AtGIF1 or AtGRF5 results in normally shaped
but larger leaves. The combined genetic and molecular
data support the notion that AN3/ATGIF1 and ATGRF5
act together to promote plate meristem activity and thus
leaf size [102].
The positive regulation of cell expansion is also important
for leaf size and involves ARGOS-LIKE (ARL), a gene
related to ARGOS [105]. At the organ level manipulating
the levels and/or duration of ARL activity results in similar
effects on organ size than related alterations in ARGOS
activity. Interestingly, ARL is required for general cell
expansion, as opposed to polar cell expansion/elongation, during organ growth. ARL appears to mediate BRrelated signaling in general cell expansion. Thus, although
ARGOS and ARL are structurally related genes that affect
leaf size, they do affect different cellular processes during
organogenesis. Other promoters of cell expansion and
leaf size include AtGRF1, AtGRF2, and AtGRF3, homologs
of AtGRF5 [103]. Single or various double-mutant combinations of single mutant alleles showed either no or only
small defects in leaf growth. A grf1 grf2 grf3 triple null
mutant, however, exhibited an approximate 32% reduction of the surface area of third leaves. 35S::AtGRF1 or
35S::AtGRF2 plants exhibited variably increased leaf size.
A cellular analysis of the phenotypes indicated that the
leaf-size defects are due to corresponding alterations in
cell size [103]. In addition, several so-called extra-small sisters (xs) mutants with a defect in cell expansion, leading to
reduced leaf size but normal leaf shape, have recently
been isolated [106].

Right column shows Bonferroni-corected p-values for significance of over-representation. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant.

It remains to be seen if SRF4 affects cell proliferation, cell
size, or a combination of both, and whether or not SRF4
participates in the control of the leaf size checkpoint. It is
possible that SRF4 may affect plate meristem activity
given that the leaf index (ratio of length over width)
remains constant across srf4 mutants, wild type, and
35S::SRF4 transgenic plants. Furthermore, SRF4 might be
involved in cell size control as GO term enrichment analysis among genes coexpressed with SRF4 hints at SRF4
being part of a mechanism inolving pectinesterase activity. It will be interesting to determine how SRF4 relates to
the known mechanisms regulating leaf size.

Martine Batoux and K.S., unpublished observations), and
influences root hair patterning [30,31]. What about the
functions of the other SRF genes? Ectopic expression of
several SRF genes interferes with normal development
and can result in seedling lethality or male sterility due to
aberrant pollen development. Regarding the analysis of
the loss-of-function mutants subtle phenotypes may have
been overlooked or mutants are yet to be exposed to the
appropriate environmental conditions. In addition, particularly in the case of SRF6, SRF7 and SRF8 sufficient SRF
activity could still be present in the analysed T-DNA insertion lines.

Functions of other SRF genes
What is the function of the other SRF genes and is there
redundancy due to functional overlap between individual
SRF genes in this gene family? At present we cannot provide definitive answers to these questions. SUB/SCM
affects the orientation of the cell division plane and cell
number in many plant tissues [29] (Ram Kishor Yadav,

The SRF gene family may also be characterised by a level
of redundancy among family members, as demonstrated
in several gene families encoding RLKs [1215,22,23,25,26,107]. Several lines of investigations, while
each not conclusive in its own right, provide a tentative
basis for this type of redundancy to play a subordinate
role in the SRF gene family. Sequence differences, such as

the variable, sometimes proline-rich, proximal ECD
region flanked by the sixth LRR domain and the TM
domain, the differences in the JM and alterations in the
activation segments and the C-termini, could be interpreted that many of the predicted SRF proteins carry out
separate functions. In addition, results from global pairwise SRF coexpression analysis do not support the notion
of redundancy among SRF family members. As far as
sequence conservation and expression profiles are concerned the gene pairs SRF1/3, SRF4/5 and SRF6/7 may
represent exceptions. However, with the exception of
altered leaves in srf4 mutants, we did not observe obvious
phenotypes in the corresponding single and double
mutants. In particular, the leaves of srf5 looked normal. In
addition, SRF4 and SRF5 feature different C-termini, the
members of the three gene pairs differ in the GO term
enrichments in the groups of coexpressed genes, and SRF6
and SRF7 exhibit varying expression profiles. Finally, the
failure of 35S::SRF1-8 constructs to rescue the sub-1 phenotype suggests that none of the tested genes can functionally replace SUB. Thus, the combined available
evidence indicates that SRF genes exhibit diversity at the
functional level.

[108-114]. Recently, evidence emerged indicated a link
between sterol biosynthesis, cellulose synthesis and the
building of a cell wall [115,116]. Future experiments will
test some of these indicators regarding SRF function.

What then are the hypothetical roles of SRF genes? Global
expression profiling and the analysis of the enrichment of
GO terms among genes coexpressed with SRF genes
revealed possible functions for some of the SRF genes.
Several SRF genes may be involved in cell wall biosynthesis and/or function. For example, expression profiling of
SRF1 and SRF3 suggests a role for these genes in lignification and pectin biosynthesis. SRF3 may also have a function in the cell biology of the Golgi system and in vascular
tissue pattern formation. SRF4 may be involved in a process requiring pectinesterase activity. SRF6 could play a
role in the defense response against pathogenic fungi.
Expression profiling of SRF6 also raises the possibility that
this gene may be involved in stress-related processes
including responses to heat and light. The srf6 and srf7
single mutants, and srf6 srf7 double mutants, were subjected to a set of heat-stress-related assays. However, no
aberrant phenotypes were detected at the plant level (Jane
Larkindale and Elizabeth Vierling, personal communication). The lack of phenotype may be due to remaining
wild type SRF6 and SRF7 activities in those lines (see
above). It is still possible, however, that srf6 or srf7
mutants exhibit defects that can only be detected by biochemical or cell biological assays.

Methods

The GO-term analysis of SRF7 raises the possibility that
SRF7 may act in primary cell wall biosynthesis and processes requiring cellulose synthase activity. SRF8 may be
involved in sterol biosynthesis. Perhaps this explains the
seedling lethality in 35S::SRF8 plants as sterol biosynthesis is required for embryo and seedling development

Homozygous T-DNA insertion lines were confirmed by a
different gene-specific primer set. Double mutants were
generated by crossing confirmed single mutants, selfing of
the F1 plants, and PCR-based progeny testing in the F2. A
detailed summary is given in Additional file 1. Confirmed
single T-DNA insertion mutants in Col background were

Conclusion
We studied the function of the LRR-V/SRF gene family
encoding putative LRR-RLKs. The genetic analysis of SRF4
indicates a function in the control of leaf size. With the
exception of plants defective in SUB/SCM and SRF4 activity, srf single mutants, and several double-mutant combinations, did not show obvious phenotypes making it
difficult to infer gene function. Results from sequence
comparisons and global SRF coexpression analyses are
compatible with the view that redundancy among members does not play a major role in this gene family. New
assays for SRF function need to take into account novel
information obtained from various sources. For example,
the bioinformatic analysis of microarray expression profiles and GO term enrichments among coexpressed genes
raises the possibility that some of the SRF genes may relate
to several aspects of cell wall biology. This work provides
a basis for future analysis of SRF function.

Plant work and genetics
Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. var. Columbia (Col-0)
and var. Landsberg (erecta mutant) (Ler) were used as
wild-type strains. The sub-1 mutant was described previously [29]. Plants were grown in a greenhouse under
Philips SON-T Plus 400 Watt fluorescent bulbs on a long
day cycle (16 hrs light). Dry seeds were sown on soil
(Patzer Einheitserde, extra-gesiebt, Typ T, Patzer GmbH &
Co. KG, Sinntal-Jossa, Germany) situated above a layer of
perlite, stratified for 4 days at 4°C, and then placed in the
greenhouse. The plants were kept under a lid for the next
7–8 days to increase humidity and support equal germination. T-DNA insertion lines for all SRF genes were
obtained from various sources including SIGnAL [117],
the University of Wisconsin Knockout facility [118], SAIL
(Syngenta Biotechnology, Research Triangle Park, NC,
USA) [119], and GABI-KAT [120]. Except for srf7-2 (ecotype Wassilewskija, Ws) all T-DNA insertion mutations
are in the Col background. Genomic DNA of wild-type
and different T-DNA insertion lines was isolated according to standard procedures. The insertion lines were
screened by a PCR-based approach with corresponding TDNA-specific and gene-specific primers.

also introduced into the Ler background by crossing single
mutants with Ler, F1 selfing, and F2 progeny testing for
homozygous srf T-DNA insertions and homozygous er
background. Morphological inspection of single mutant
(either in Col or Ler backgrounds) and double-mutant
(Col background) plants was done with plants grown in
the greenhouse under regular growth conditions. The following single mutants were used in the analysis: srf1-2,
srf1-3, srf1-7, srf2-1, srf2-3, srf3-1, srf3-3, srf3-7, srf4-2, srf43, srf5-1, srf5-2, srf6-2, srf6-4, srf7-2, srf7-3 and srf8-2. The
following double mutants were analysed: srf1-3 srf3-1,
srf4-2 srf5-1, srf4-3 srf5-1, srf4-3 srf5-2, srf6-2 srf7-2, srf6-2
srf7-3. More detailed information regarding the lines is
given in Additional file 1.
To avoid crowding artefacts plants were sown at a maximum density of 5 plants per pot (7 cm × 7 cm). Following
planting, individual plants were inspected for morphological alterations every two days. Assayed traits included
hypocotyl length, number, size and shape of rosette
leaves, trichome morphology, flowering time, stem morphology, flower morphology (including ovules and pollen), fertility, and seed size and shape. To analyse
germination behavior and root development, dry seeds of
wild-type, single and double-mutants were surface-sterilized, plated on 0.9% agar plates containing 0.5×
Murashige and Skoog medium [121] supplemented with
1% sucrose, stratified for 4 days at 4°C, and then moved
to a cell-culture room kept at 22°C and 24 hrs light. Plates
were placed vertically next to vertically arranged fluorescent bulbs. Root growth was assayed after 10 days. Leaf
blade measurements were done using images of dissected
fifth rosette leaves that had been scanned into the computer and with the help of ImageJ software [122].
Molecular work, DNA sequencing and cDNA isolation
For DNA and RNA work standard molecular biology techniques were used [123]. Sequences were obtained by
standard cycle sequencing using an ABI 373 sequencer (PE
Applied Biosystems). PCR products, genomic and cDNA
clones were sequenced on both strands. Additional 5' and
3' ends were obtained through a rapid amplification of
cDNA ends approach [124] using the Marathon kit
(CLONTECH) and poly(A)+ RNA (Col) from flowers of
stages 1–12 [125] (SRF1A/B to SRF5, SRF7-8) or rosette
leaves (SRF6). The various SRF full-length cDNA
sequences have been deposited at GenBank. For a summary see Table 1. For a list of primers see Additional file 1.
Developmental expression profile of SRF genes by RTPCR
Cauline and rosette leaves were harvested from 31 days
old plants. Stage 1–12 flowers (stages according to [125]),
siliques and stems were collected from 30 to 38 days old
plants, roots from 14 days old plants grown on standard

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/16

MS-agar plates, and seedlings were taken at 14 days. Primers were taken from the SRF sequences that flank the
transmembrane domains. This region is very variable
between the different SRF genes. The exception is SRF1 for
which primers were chosen that reside in the region
encoding the juxtramembrane domain. PCR conditions
included the following parameters: denaturation at 94°C
for 1 minute, annealing at gene-specific annealing temperature, elongation at 72°C for 1 minute, 40 cycles, final
extension at 72°C for 2 minutes. The GAPC gene was used
as control [126].
Computer-based sequence analysis
Homology searches were done with the BLAST tool [127].
The signal peptide sequences, the proline-rich regions, the
transmembrane domains, and the PEST motifs were determined using the SMART [128], PROSITE [129], PSORT
[130], and PESTfind [131] websites. The kinase domains
were detected through the PlantsP database [132]. The
subdomain organisation of the kinase domains was
inferred from published kinase alignments [38]. Sequence
alignments were done with MultAlin [133,134] using the
following parameters: symbol comparison table: identity,
gap weight: 5, gap length weight: 0, consensus levels: high
= 100% low = 60%. Phylogenetic tree analysis of the SRF
family was performed using an amino acid sequence
alignment generated by the program DAMBE [135] using
a gap penalty value of 20. Using this alignment a maximum likelihood tree was generated in TREE-PUZZLE
[136] with the help of the JTT model of substitution. Rate
heterogeneity was estimated with the gamma distribution
model with eight rate categories as described in [137]. We
also tested different approaches (Baysian inference,
Neighbor-joining) but the topology of the tree did not
change. TREEVIEW was used to visualise the tree [138].
Overexpression of SRF genes
The full length SRF open reading frames (ORFs) were
amplified from individual full-length SRF cDNA clones by
PCR. The SRF ORFs were cloned in sense orientation into
a modified version of the plant transformation vector
pCAMBIA2300 [139]. The modified pCAMBIA2300 vector includes a 3× myc tag and allows the generation of SRF
proteins that are tagged with a 3× myc-tag at their carboxy
ends (Ram Kishor Yadav and K.S., unpublished work). To
this end, we cloned the PCR fragments into the 5' AscI and
3' AatII sites except for SRF2 and SRF5, for which we used
ApaI at the 3' end. The various SRF:myc ORFs are flanked
5' by the CaMV 35S promoter and 3' by a nopaline synthase transcription termination signal. The Agrobacterium
strain GV3101 was used for plant transformation [140]
using the floral dip method [141]. For 35S::SRF1B:myc
and 35S::SRF2 to 35S::SRF7:myc at least 50 transgenic T1
sub-1 (in Ler background), Ler, and Col plants were

selected on kanamycin plates (50 μg/ml) and then transferred to soil.

mary expression measurements from 21,559 genes met
the quality criteria and were used for subsequent analysis.

Transgene expression in at least 5 lines of each experiment
was confirmed by RT-PCR using a gene-specific primer
and a myc-tag-derived primer. In the case of
35S::SRF1A:myc, the majority of T1 plants died at the 2cotyledon stage, irrespective of the background (sub-1, Ler,
and Col). We managed, however, to isolate 11 (in sub-1
background), 38 (Ler), and 29 (Col) T1 survivors. We
tested 7 (sub-1), 8 (Ler) and 5 (Col) 35S::SRF1A:myc T1
lines positive in RT-PCR assays for transgene expression.
No apparent modification of either the sub-1 or wild-type
phenotype was observed in those T1 plants. The
35S::SRF8:myc T1 plants exhibited a similar lethality at the
2-cotyledon stage. Again a few T1 plants escaped the seedling lethality (20 (sub-1), 58 (Ler) and 20 (Col)). We could
detect transgene expression by RT-PCR in 5 (sub-1), 14
(Ler), 3 (Col) T1 plants, respectively. No apparent modification of either the sub-1 or wild-type phenotype was
observed in those T1 plants either.

For statistical analysis of the expression data we applied
the FunDaMiner system [145]. We calculated probe set
summaries for the complete dataset using MAS 5.0, dChip
[146] and RMA [147]. The complete dataset was normalized by applying the LMPN method. LMPN is based on
the local polynomial regression fitting method loess
[148,149] operating on MA-scale [150]. For the correlation analysis we summarized replicates (usually 3) by the
arithmetic mean. For 1784 measurements, i.e. microarray
experiments, we computed the correlation matrix of allagainst all probe sets. Correlations were determined as
metric (Pearson) correlation coefficients. To investigate
expression profiles for each SRF gene within in this
expression data set, we determined for each experiment its
mean and standard deviation (σ). Expression values in the
plots are expressed as fold σ difference to the mean.

Microscopy and art work
Pictures of plants or various plant organs were taken with
an SZX12 stereo microscope from Olympus coupled to a
ColorView III digital camera and using Cell^P software
(Olympus Europa GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). Images
were saved as TIFF files and adjusted for color and contrast
using Adobe Photoshop CS2 (Adobe, San Jose, CA, USA)
software on an iMac G5 computer (Apple, Cupertino, CA,
USA). Composites were also generated by Adobe Photoshop CS2. Line drawings were generated using Adobe
Illustrator CS2.
Microarray analysis
Microarray data were obtained from the NASC Affywatch
service (CD-ROM release as of June, 2005; [142]). To
avoid complications from the comparison between different platforms, we only used measurements from the
Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip platform. Probe sets were recalculated according to the following scheme: all oligonucleotides present on the ATH1 GeneChip of Affymetrix
(sequences downloaded from [143] as of October 2004)
were mapped on the whole genome sequence (MAtDB
release from 24th of September, 2004, [144]) and realigned against coding sequences. UTR sequences were
included if the respective gene is associated with full
length cDNA information. Oligonucleotides aligning to
more than one gene and probes without perfect matches
were excluded. For subsequent calculations, only probe
sets with at least five unique probe pairs were considered.
About 10% of the original probe sets led to unspecific estimates indicating the need for the re-alignments. We
excluded those probe sets from our refined sets. In sum-

Enrichment for GO categories
GOslim annotations for Arabidopsis were obtained from
TAIR [37]. For our analysis, we considered solely GO
annotations derived from the ontology describing biological processes. Gene lists were matched with the 21,559
genes analyzed in this study. GO terms annotated only
once in the genome were not considered. To determine
whether a set of genes correlated to a particular SRF is
enriched for a specific GO term, we tested for its statistical
overrepresentation within the set compared to the background (whole genome) expectation. P-values were
obtained for each GO category present in the set by cumulative binomial probability:

P(k ≥ x) =

n

⎛n⎞

∑ ⎜ k ⎟ pk ( 1 − p )

n−k

k−x ⎝

⎠
where n is the number of all studied genes associated with
a specific GO annotation, x is the number of observed
genes correlated to a particular SRF and associated with
this GO annotation, and p is the genomic frequency of
this GO annotation, i.e. the number of genes annotated
for this GO identifier divided by the number of all studied
genes. P-values were Bonferroni-corrected for multiple
hypothesis testing. For each SRF, the total number of tests
corresponded to the number of different GO annotations
of its correlated gene set.
