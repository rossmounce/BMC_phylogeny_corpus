zoonotic pathogens

Abstract
Background: High-pathogenic Y. enterocolitica ssp. enterocolitica caused several human outbreaks in Northern
America. In contrast, low pathogenic Y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica serobiotype O:3/4 is responsible for sporadic
cases worldwide with asymptomatic pigs being the main source of infection. Genomes of three Y. enterocolitica
ssp. palearctica serobiotype O:3/4 human isolates (including the completely sequenced Y11 German DSMZ type
strain) were compared to the high-pathogenic Y. enterocolitica ssp. enterocolitica 8081 O:8/1B to address the
peculiarities of the O:3/4 group.
Results: Most high-pathogenicity-associated determinants of Y. enterocolitica ssp. enterocolitica (like the HighPathogenicity Island, yts1 type 2 and ysa type 3 secretion systems) are absent in Y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica
serobiotype O:3/4 genomes. On the other hand they possess alternative putative virulence and fitness factors, such
as a different ysp type 3 secretion system, an RtxA-like and insecticidal toxins, and a N-acetyl-galactosamine
(GalNAc) PTS system (aga-operon). Horizontal acquisition of two prophages and a tRNA-Asn-associated GIYep-01
genomic island might also influence the Y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica serobiotype O:3/4 pathoadaptation. We
demonstrated recombination activity of the PhiYep-3 prophage and the GIYep-01 island and the ability of the agaoperon to support the growth of the Y. enterocolitica ssp. enterocolitica O:8/1B on GalNAc.
Conclusions: Y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica serobiotype O:3/4 experienced a shift to an alternative patchwork of
virulence and fitness determinants that might play a significant role in its host pathoadaptation and successful
worldwide dissemination.

Background
The gram-negative bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica is a
widely disseminated gastrointestinal pathogen that
belongs to the genus Yersinia together with enteropathogenic Y. pseudotuberculosis and the plague agent,
Y. pestis. It has been proposed that Y. enterocolitica and
Y. pseudotuberculosis have diverged within the last 200
million years while Y. pestis is a more recent descendant
of Y. pseudotuberculosis [1,2]. All these species have
evolved with diverse clinical symptoms. Y. pseudotuberculosis can cause tuberculosis-like symptoms in animals.
In humans, the clinical manifestations are similar, but
often they are more severe compared to those with Y.

mimic appendicitis, mainly in children, and have similar
extra intestinal sequelae compared to Y. enterocolitica.
Y. pestis is the agent of the plague, transmitted by the
bite of an infected flea and it is primarily a rodent
pathogen.
Yersinia enterocolitica can be differentiated by bioand serotyping [3,4]. Biotype (BT) 1A strains are considered as non-pathogenic, whereas high-pathogenic
BT1B (predominant in the U.S.A.) and low to moderate-pathogenic BT2-5 (predominant in Europe, Asia
and Australia) are enteropathogenic for humans and
animals. Y. enterocolitica serogroup O:3 biotype 4 (in
the following designated as serobiotype O:3/4 or O:3/
4) comprises about 80-90% of human isolates in Germany and Europe, with rising global relevance [5-7]. It
is responsible for gastroenteritis, lymphadenitis and
various extra intestinal sequelae as erythema nodosum

and reactive arthritis [8]. Asymptomatic and ill pigs are
the main animal reservoir of this serobiotype [9,10],
leading to a high submission of O:3/4 contaminations
in butcher shops in Germany and countries in northeastern Europe [11-14]. In contrast, Y. enterocolitica
biotype 1B strains (also called New World strains)
were documented predominantly in the U.S.A. as
human outbreak and environmental isolates. Pathogenicity analysis, however, has been mainly focused on
Y. enterocolitica serobiotype O:8/1B, of which a complete genome sequence is available (strain 8081, [15],
accession no.
NC_008800.1 and
NC_008791 (plasmid)). The differentiation between
biotype 1B and the Old World strains has been legitimated in the assembly of two subspecies, Y. enterocolitica ssp. enterocolitica for biotype 1B and Y.
enterocolitica ssp. palearctica for the Old World
strains [16].
To compare these two groups of geographically and
phylogenetically distinct yersiniae, we determined the
complete genome sequence of the European serobiotype
O:3/4 DSMZ reference strain Y11 isolated from a
patient stool (EMBL accession numbers: FR729477 and
FR745874 (plasmid) as announced recently [17]) and
compared it with the available Y. enterocolitica ssp.
enterocolitica 8081 O:8/1B genome. Draft sequences of
two other Y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica O:3/4 strains
of human origin, named Y8265 and Y5307 (derived
from a human patient isolate from France and an arthritis positive human patient isolate, respectively) and a
closely related Y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica strain
(named Y5,27P) of serobiotype O:5,27/3 were used
when appropriate to gain a better insight into peculiarities of the Y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica. Comparison
of these closely related pathogens enables us to uncover
potential pathogenicity and fitness determinants

involved in pathoadaptation and worldwide dissemination of Y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica O:3/4.

Results
1. General characteristics

The genome of Y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica Y11
(serobiotype O:3/4) consists of a circular chromosome
spanning 4,553,420 bp with a GC content of 47.01% and
a virulence associated pYVO3 plasmid of 72,460 bp with
an overall GC content of 43.99% (see Table 1 and additional file 1). The tabular SEED comparison between
serobiotype O:3/4 strains Y11, Y8265, Y5307, serobiotype O:5,27/3 and serobiotype O:8/1B strain 8081 is
added as additional file 2.
2. Y. enterocolitica ssp. enterocolitica genes absent from Y.
enterocolitica ssp. palearctica

Certain virulence determinants associated with the
high-pathogenicity phenotype of Y. enterocolitica ssp.
enterocolitica are missing in serobiotype O:3/4. The most
prominent are the High-Pathogenicity Island (HPI),
involved in the yersiniabactin-mediated iron uptake
[18-20], and two chromosomally encoded secretion systems, ysa T3SS and yts1 T2SS, located within the Plasticity Zone (PZ) [21]. Besides HPI and PZ several genomic
islands (YGI-2 and YGI-3) and prophages (e.g. FYE250,
FYE185 (encoding the Vaps virulence-associated proteins)) described for serobiotype O:8/1B strain 8081 are
absent in O:3/4. In addition, the pYV plasmids of O:3/4
and O:8/1B are more divergent than the corresponding
genome sequences. In contrast, the pYVe227 plasmid of
serobiotype O:9/2 (accession no. AF102990) is closely
related to pYVO3 plasmid (additional file 3). Also the
clusters for the LPS biosynthesis differ. In O:3/4, two
separate clusters are present as reported previously (for
the outer core, Y11_19901-20011 and O-antigen,
Y11_16711-16781) [22,23].
Most of the genome differences between O:8/1B and
other serobiotypes have been described previously [15].

*) The higher number of CDS for the O:3/4 pYV plasmid compared to O:8/1B is evoked by more transposase-like CDS (including also remnant or fragmented
transposases) and more than 20 hypothetical CDS with no strong similarity on protein level to serobiotype O:8/1B. In addition, we found an arsABRH gene cluster
present in the pYV plasmid of serobiotypes O:3/4 and O:9/2, but not in O:8/1B.

Nevertheless there are some additional potential virulence-associated genes that have been uncovered by our
genome comparison, including putative haemolysins
(YE2407-2408, YE2966), putative adhesins (YE1873) and
a putative ospG-like gene (YE3860).
3. Y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica O:3/4 specific genes
absent from Y. enterocolitica ssp. enterocolitica O:8/1B
Putative toxins

In serobiotype O:3/4 we found a gene cluster encoding
an RtxA-like protein and its adjacent genes, rtxC and
rtxH, (Y11_18761, Y11_18771 and Y11_18781) (see
Figure 1). The large RtxA protein (Y11_18761, about
350 kDa) could play a role in the pathogenesis of O:3/4,
since members of the wide family of Rtx proteins have
been shown to be major contributors to pathogenicity
[24-28]. The effector domains in the middle of the protein show no homology to already known family members. Therefore, the potential mode of action of the
RtxA-like protein is unclear in this strain. In addition,
the genes encoding the RtxA secretion system
(Y11_10141-10171) are interrupted by a frame shift in
O:3/4, raising the question of functional RtxA export.
Bacteriocins constitute a large group of bacterial toxins
used to inhibit growth of closely related bacteria. The
bacteriocin Y11_33511 in O:3/4 shows sequence homology to pyocin-like proteins and DNAses, therefore being
a potential endonuclease enzyme. It is followed by two
putative immunity proteins (Y11_33521-33531). The
duplication of immunity protein like genes could hint at
a particular toxin with extreme toxicity for its host.
A member of cell wall-associated hydrolases
(Y11_03361, a putative invasion-associated protein) of
about 422 amino acids is encoded in a 2 kbp large genomic region absent from O:8/1B strain 8081. The hydrolase encoding CDS is located between yeiH and yeiE,
encoding a potential membrane protein and a

Figure 1 RtxA toxin cluster in Y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica
strain Y11 (O:3/4). This gene cluster is inserted into the backbone
of Y. enterocolitica ssp. enterocolitica strain 8081 (O:8). The cluster
comprises 10.6 kbp encoding three genes, rtxA, rtxC and a
hypothetical VC1449 gene (according to a protein homolog of
Vibrio cholerae).

transcriptional regulator with yet unknown functions. A
3,075 bp putative invasion precursor gene (Y11_38661)
and a hlyD like gene (Y11_09551) have been found in Y.
enterocolitica O:3/4. The putative invasin revealed
homology to Ig-like domains and has a similar domain
structure typical of invasion proteins. Genes of the ABC
transporter family ([29,30]) lie adjacent to hlyD in O:3/4
that support its possible export.
We also found several toxin-antitoxin systems in serobiotype O:3/4 that are absent or different from those
found in serobiotype O:8/1B. One toxin-antitoxin system (TA) was annotated as YgiT-(antitoxin, Y11_40161)
and YgiU-(toxin, Y11_40151) like proteins in O:3/4.
Kasari et al. reported that the protein YgiU inhibits
growth and induces rapid shutdown of protein synthesis
in vivo. The cluster is transcriptionally repressed by
YgiT and activated by HipA [31]. Another TA cluster
found in O:3/4 is annotated as YfjZ (antitoxin,
Y11_30951) and YpjF (toxin, Y11_30941), reported to be
a putative part of a defective prophage with unknown
function [32].
Insecticidal toxin cluster

An insecticidal toxin cluster (Tc, Y11_26921Y11_27061), initially described in serobiotype O:9/2
[33], is found in serobiotype O:3/4 downstream of tldD,
Y11_27071. The toxin cluster comprises four proteins,
Tca, Tcb, Tcc and Tcd and is represented in serobiotype
O:9/2 by TcaA, TcaB, TcaC and TccC. It was shown
that these toxins are active at temperatures below 30°C
and the lysates could kill M. sexta within 5 days [34].
Interestingly, TcaB is split into two proteins and tcaC is
interrupted by a stop codon. Still the system was proven
to be functional in O:9/2. In serobiotype O:3/4 one of
the two putative tcaA regulatory genes is split into two
smaller ones and TcaA (Y11_26951) is a truncated version of the serobiotype O:9/2 protein (see Figure 2).
TcaB (Y11_26971) is a single protein in contrast to O:9/
2, and the tcaC’(1) gene (Y11_26981) undergoes a frame
shift at position 3498 (not at position 314 as in O:9/2).
Since this gene cluster differed surprisingly between
strains of the same subspecies, we analysed the Tc cluster of the related serobiotype O:5,27/3. This strain also
harbours an insecticidal toxin complex closely related to
that of serobiotypes O:3/4 and O:9/2. The cluster of
O:5,27/3 is the only one with a single tcaC gene (Figure
2). In addition, the tcaR2 is, as well as tcaB, not fragmented. Another putative insecticidal toxin encoding
CDS (Y11_05031), which is not clustered with the Tc
cluster described above, is present in O:3/4. The protein
is homologous to the insecticidal TccC2 and TccC3 proteins of Y. enterocolitica O:9/2.
Flagellar genes, beta-fimbrial genes and other fimbriae

A large 21 kbp flagellar cluster (Y11_24071-24361) present in O:3/4 genomes is similar to the flag-2 gene

Figure 2 Insecticidal toxin gene complex in Y. enterocolitica O:9/2, O:3/4 and O:5,27/3. The structural organisation of the cluster is the
same in all serobiotypes, but the encoded proteins differ in length and are to some extent fragmented. For O:5,27/3, the cluster is the only one
with only a single tcaC gene. In addition, the tcaR2 is, as well as tcaB, complete.

cluster of O:9/2 [35]. Only parts of this cluster demonstrated low similarity to O:8/1B genes. The functionality
and role of this cluster in pathogenesis are questionable,
since experimental observation indicates a weak motility
for O:3/4 strains in vitro.
Operons of the b-fimbriae usually do not resemble
typical tip adhesins [36]. They may encode thin fibrillae
or nonfimbrial surface structures. We found two clusters
of putative beta-fimbriae in O:3/4 (Y11_14931-14971
and Y11_26051-26081), both absent from O:8/1B.
Chromosomally encoded type three secretion system (T3SS)
and Aat-secretion

The virulence-associated chromosomal ysa T3SS is
absent in O:3/4. Even so, O:3/4 harbours an alternative
24 kbp T3SS (designated ysp T3SS, Y11_35171-35491,
see Figure 3) in the same genome background. The ysp
T3SS system is homologous to the Salmonella SPI-2
T3SS [37], but lacks some functional parts. The translocon is present, but the SsaGH proteins of the needle are
missing, as well as SsaR from the inner membrane ring.
In addition, there are no effector proteins linked directly
to the secretion system gene cluster. Thus, the ysp T3SS
awaits the identification of its putative effectors and possible involvement in pathogenicity or cell-cell
interactions.
The aatPABCD cluster in enteroaggregative E. coli
(EAEC) encodes a specialized ABC transporter, which
plays a role in virulence by transporting dispersin out of
bacterial cell [38]. In serobiotype O:3/4, we found a
four-gene aat cluster with one gene homologous both
to aatB and aatA. The cluster (Y11_24511 -Y11_24421)
is interspaced and flanked by small hypothetical genes
and transposases. The functionality in O:3/4 is yet

Figure 3 Y. enterocolitica palearctica O:3/4-specific
chromosomally encoded type three secretion system. This
system is similar to the SPI-2 of Salmonella. The translocon of the
apparatus is present, but SsaGH proteins of the needle are missing;
also SsaR from the inner membrane ring. In addition, no effector
proteins are linked directly to the secretion system gene cluster in
the genome strain Y11.

uncharacterised, but a potential role in pathogenesis as
for the EAEC, cannot be excluded.
Carbon source uptake and other metabolic differences

N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine
are components of the intestinal mucin in pigs and
humans. The amount of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine is
nearly twice that of any of the other sugars present in
the pig’s small intestinal mucin [39]. In contrast, Nacetyl-D-glucosamine is the major amino sugar in
human mucin [40]. The composition and modification
of mucin is a critical defence mechanism in the prevention against pathogenic bacteria in the intestine. Enteric
bacteria differ in their ability to grow on N-acetyl-galactosamine (GalNAc or Aga) and on D-galactosamine
(GalN or Gam). N-acetyl-galactosamine utilized in Yersinia can be taken up as a carbon source by a specific
phosphotransferase system (PTS). The enzymes that
build the transport complex are AgaVWEF, and the
genes are clustered in an operon in Y. enterocolitica
O:3/4 (see Figure 4) that is absent in O:8/1B.
The utilisation of different amino sugars (GalNAc,
Gam, GlcNAc (N-acetyl-glucosamine) and Nag (D-glucosamine)) was analysed in strains of two serobiotypes,
O:3/4 and O:8/1B, in minimal medium with 0.2% amino
sugars. As expected, both serobiotypes were able to
grow in 0.2% N-acetyl-glucosamine and glucosamine.
Since the Gam PTS encoding genes (agaBCD) are
absent from serobiotypes O:3/4 and O:8/1B, we found
all strains unable to grow in galactosamine as the only
source for carbon. However, O:3/4 strain Y11 was able
to use GalNAc as the only carbon source, even though
we did not find a homolog for the downstream processing agaA gene in O:3/4 (Figure 5). To prove the sufficiency of agaVWEF to support growth on GalNAc, we
subcloned the operon (Y11_11961-Y11_12031) into
pGEM-T Easy (Promega). Strain WA-314, O:8/1B,
transformed with agaVWEF, acquired the ability to
grow in the presence of GalNAc. Thus, the aga-operon

agaVWEF) in Y. enterocolitica O:3/4. Displayed genes have been
subcloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) to supplement serobiotype
O:8/1B with the additional PTS.

Therefore, the CGH may contribute to the ability of
bacteria to infect the host through the oral route. We
found one CGH in O:3/4 (Y11_23571). The gene for
CGH is absent from O:8/1B, reflecting different niches
and host infection routes.

with glucose, washed and inoculated in M9 containing different
amino sugars and sugars as the only carbon source. Negative

alone is able to support the utilisation of N-acetyl-galactosamine in vitro and supplies Y. enterocolitica with the
ability to efficiently utilize this important amino sugar of
the intestinal mucin.
We found a second urea transporter system in O:3/4
(Y11_22281-22341), which is independent and different
from the first one shared with O:8/1B. There is no
obvious explanation for the presence of two different
urea clusters in O:3/4. Since the urea systems are unrelated in protein composition, they must have been
acquired independently.
Many bacteria isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract show bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity
mediated by the choloylglycine hydrolase (CGH). How
this enzyme contributes to the functions of bacteria in
the gastrointestinal tract is not known. Studies have
shown that choloylglycine hydrolase (CGH) confers the
ability to resist the antimicrobial action of bile salts [41].

Mobile genetic elements are known to be involved in
horizontal gene transfer, HGT. They utilize site-specific
integrases for recombination with the core genome and
use small RNA genes as attachment sites for integration.
We have found 13 copies of integrase genes in the Y11
genome (strain 8081 has 21 copies), but most of them
seem to be truncated and no more functional. In Y11, 5
of the 13 annotated integrase genes are located next to
tRNA genes. This was also the case for a tRNA-Asn
that has acquired a novel genomic island of 14.9 kbp,
GIYep-01. Three different tRNA-Asn loci are found in
Yersinia. One of these tRNA-Asn copies has acquired
the HPI in O:8/1B [20], while the GIYep-01 island
(Y11_15011-Y11_15121) occupies one of the tRNA-Asn
copies in O:3/4. GIYep-01 has a GC content similar to
the core genome sequence. In contrast, HPI has an elevated GC content and an inactivated integrase [42].
Translated CDSs of GIYep-01 show homologies to a
metallo-beta-lactamase domain containing protein,
SbcC, a protease like protein, an antirestriction protein
and transition helper proteins, with the latter ones as
typical members of mobile elements. To prove the
mobility of GIYep-01 and functionality of its integrase,
we have performed a nested PCR with JB470 and JB472,
JB471 and JB473 primers to follow the restoration of the
attP recombination site of the circular excised island.
Results of the PCR and sequencing demonstrated the
precise excision of the GIYep-1 island. Moreover, when
the integrase and its attachment sites were analysed in
two other serobiotype O:3/4 strains, Y8265 and Y5307,
both harboured a full-length integrase and intact attachment sites.
Prophages as main Y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica
acquisitions

We found a filamentous prophage (Y11_09601-09661) in
the Y11 genome that was highly homologous to CUS-1
of E. coli [43] and the Ypf prophage of Y. pestis [44]. In
Y. pestis, the Ypf genome contains all functional modules needed for the assembly and production of viable
phages and is suspected to play a role in Y. pestis virulence [44].
The PhiYep-1 prophage is absent from strain 8081,
O:8/1B; nevertheless, the infection with this prophage
has been demonstrated for all three pathogenic Yersinia
species [45]. However, the comparison of PhiYep-1

Batzilla et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:348
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/348

prophages in two other serobiotype O:3/4 strains, Y8265
and Y5307, showed that the prophage sequence has
already suffered successive deletions in both strains
(Figure 6).
We found that the PhiYep-1 prophage constitutes a
part of the 28 kbp tandem repeat amplified in Y. enterocolitica after elevation of ampicillin levels [46]. This
repeat harbours the blaA gene and at least part of the
PhiYep-1 prophage, indicating a possible link between
PhiYep-1 tandem multiplication and elevated ampicillin
resistance. By PCR we proved the multiplication of the
28 kbp fragment in Y11, but also in the absence of
ampicillin. Moreover, when we raised the ampicillin
concentration from 100 μg/ml to 1,000 μg/ml, both for
Y11 and Y5307 that lacks most of the PhiYep-1
sequence, the strains were able to grow in 1,000 μg/ml
ampicillin containing LB media with similar overnight
densities. Thus, the tandem multiplication of the
PhiYep-1 prophage together with the nearby blaA
region, seems not to be the only mechanism of the
rapid ampicillin resistance acquisition in O:3/4.
At least two highly homologous P2-like prophages,
PhiYep-2 (Y11_25141-25551) and PhiYep-3 (Y11_13081Y11_13511) are integrated in different tRNA genes in
the Y11 genome; PhiYep-2 in tRNA-Met and PhiYep-3
in tRNA-Leu. These phages are highly homologous to
the P2-like prophage in Y. pseudotuberculosis IP32953
(additional file 4). PhiYep-3 contains a full-length integrase and was proven for its ability to leave its attachment site. The JB606 and JB608 primers designed for
restoration of the 123 bp attP attachment site

Page 7 of 11

demonstrated a high frequency precise excision of
PhiYep-3. Nevertheless, this prophage was absent in two
other serobiotype O:3/4 strains, Y8265 and Y5307. To
address dissemination of PhiYep-3 in serobiotype O:3/4
strains, we performed PCR for its presence in tRNA-Leu
target site. In six out of fifteen O:3/4 strains tested, the
tRNA-Leu gene was occupied by the PhiYep-3 prophage
(data not shown). Thus, presence of the highly active
PhiYep-3 prophage may serve as an additional epidemiological marker of recent and perhaps repeated
prophage acquisitions.
IS-elements

IS element copy numbers in the Yersinia genus vary
between 12 and 1,147 [47]. The number of IS elements
identified in Y11 genome using the ISfinder [48] was
slightly higher than that in 8081 (about 64 full length IS
elements). Interestingly, the variety of IS element
families was higher in O:8/1B and includes IS4 and
IS200 family members that are absent from O:3/4.
ISYen1 is the most frequent IS element in Y11 (more
than 50 copies, see Table 2).
One of the ISYen1 elements located in the promoter
region of inv effects its regulation (Frank Uliczka et al.
2011, manuscript accepted by PLoS Pathogens). Furthermore, many other genes found in O:3/4 in the vicinity
of ISYen1 or other IS elements can influence their activity. Examples are cbpA, yidE, a formate efflux transporter and dehydrogenase, argO, ycaD, and putative
virulence factors (e.g. a toxin subunit S1 precursor).
Beside the large group of ISYen1 elements, we found
seven copies of the Y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica specific IS-element ISYen2 [49]. This IS element is
related to those of the IS21 family and its two isoforms
(ISYen2A/B) are present in seven genomic copies in
O:3/4. A further ISYen2B copy is located in the pYVO3
virulence plasmid [49]. We have detected at least one
ISYen2A/B copy also in the O:5,27/3 genome.

Discussion
Two parallel processes, gene loss and acquisition, shape
the Y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica serobiotype O:3/4
genome. As expected, Y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica
strains do not carry the already defined highTable 2 Insertion sequence elements found in Y.

PhiYep-1 prophage in Y. enterocolitica O:3/4. The Ypf prophage
is representing a typical structure of a filamentous phage, with
genes for morphogenesis, secretion and replication. The cluster in
O:3/4 is notably reduced, and in strain Y5307 the Yep prophage is
reduced to only three truncated genes left, as proven by
sequencing.

pathogenicity associated features of 8081 O:8/1B ([50]).
This decreased pathogenicity may supply the O:3/4
group with a better chance to balance its interactions
with the host and support further dissemination.
Instead, Y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica demonstrates
an alternative pattern of putative virulence associated
determinants including an RtxA-like toxin, a dual functional insecticidal toxin, beta-fimbriae and a novel ysp
type 3 secretion system. Since serobiotype O:3/4 has
adapted to a very narrow and specific niche, the pig tonsils, the bacteriocin cluster found in O:3/4 would also
provide a serious advantage in colonisation. Likewise,
the ability to utilise GalNAc of the gut mucin may
represent both a virulence and fitness factor of particular importance for O:3/4 and reflects its adaptation/
association with its host.
The ysp T3SS of O:3/4 that substitutes the ysa T3SS
of O:8/1B is analogous to T3SS systems of high-pathogenic Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis, indicating a
potential role in pathogenicity. The effectors of this
T3SS have to be identified. The ysp and ysa secretion
systems are known to be involved both in “cross-talk”
with other bacteria and with the host and they are able
to support transport of “heterologous” effector molecules [51,52]. Thus, the ysp system might supply Y.
enterocolitica ssp. palearctica with an additional advantage to subvert foreign imported effectors for its benefit
even in the absence of the native ones.
Mobile genetic elements encoding multiple physiological traits play a significant role in bacterial evolution. A
novel GIYep-01 genomic island that encodes a putative
metallo-beta-lactamase and a protease in O:3/4 might
be involved both in fitness and pathogenicity of yersiniae. For its integration, GIYep-01 utilizes a P4-like integrase like the HPI in O:8/1B. However, in contrast to
the HPI that is frozen to a single tRNA-Asn site in O:8/
1B, the GIYep-01 can leave its initial tRNA-Asn locus
due to the activity of the functional integrase. Whether
the integrase of one mobility element can affect the
recombination of another one and the putative role of
the GIYep-01 in Y. enterocolitica has still to be clarified.
The filamentous PhiYep-1 prophage of O:3/4 demonstrates a high similarity to Y. pestis Ypf and E. coli CUS1 prophages. Both Ypf and CUS-1 are suspected to play
a role in pathogenicity [43]. However, due to severe
sequential deletions in the sequenced O:3/4 strains, a
possible impact of this prophage on O:3/4 pathogenicity
and elevated ampicillin resistance remains questionable.
Two copies of the highly similar P2-like prophages are
present in the Y11 genome. PhiYep-2, the one with a
truncated integrase, is frozen in tRNA-Met while
PhiYep-3, harbouring an active integrase, is integrated
into tRNA-Leu. Anyhow, the genetically active PhiYep-3
is present only in about 40% of the O:3/4 strains tested.

Page 8 of 11

Thus, the PhiYep-3 prophage seems to represent a more
recent Y11 acquisition and might serve as an additional
epidemiological marker for Y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica. The coexistence and immunity to superinfection of
these two closely related P2-like prophages poses an
additional question to be answered.
The presence of multiple IS elements tells a story of Y.
enterocolitica interactions with its biotic neighbours.
Indeed the spectrum of IS elements differs in Y. enterocolitica ssp. enterocolitica and Y. enterocolitica ssp.
palearctica, with ISYen2A/B being the low -pathogenicity specific insertion sequence whilst a wide variety of
IS families IS3, IS4 and IS200 dominates in the highpathogenicity group. These differences can be applied
both to subspecies identification and also for tracing history of interbacterial interactions.
It is remarkable that the gene clusters with potentially
closely related functions tend to occupy exactly the
same positions ("hot spots”) in the Y. enterocolitica
backbone genomes (like the T3SS, the O-antigen, an
AidA adhesin and haemolysin, the OspG protein kinase
gene cluster, etc.). On the other hand, divergence in
these clusters might result from both vertical and horizontal evolution events.
Y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica O:3/4 has an open
genome with traces of frequent gene import and wastes.
These different vectors have formed the present O:3/4
genome that combines standard yersinial determinants
with putative alternative virulence and fitness associated
factors. Such a patchwork seems to be a prerequisite for
O:3/4 successful worldwide dissemination.

Conclusions
Y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica O:3/4 becomes nowadays the dominating Yersinia worldwide. Multiple gene
losses and acquisitions experienced by its genome shift
this pathogen to explore an alternative patchwork of
virulence and fitness determinants for the efficient proliferation. Future analysis of these combinations of different virulence traits may shed a new light on the
processes and structures behind successful dissemination of bacterial pathogens in the modern world in general and of the successful emerging zoonotic pathogen
Y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica O:3/4 in particular.
Methods
Strains and DNA preparation

The Y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica Y11 (DSMZ type
strain no. 13030) serobiotype O:3/4 strain isolated from
human stool was selected for complete genome sequencing. Strain Y8265 (derived from a human isolate,
France; [53]) and Y5307 (derived from a reactive arthritis patient, institute’s strain collection) of the same serobiotype O:3/4 and strain Y5,27P of serobiotype O:5,27/3

(institute’s strain collection) were used for high coverage
draft genome sequencing (see below). DNA was prepared using NucleoBond ® AXG of Macherey-Nagel
(Düren, Germany) following the manufacturers
instructions.
For N-acetyl-galactosamine uptake experiments, the
human isolate strain WA-314 O:8/1B was used [53].

Genome sequencing and bioinformatics

The genome sequence of Y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica O:3/4 strain Y11 was determined by combination of
high-throughput whole genome shotgun sequencing
using MegaBACE (at Integrated Genomics, Jena, Germany), 454 Genome Sequencer (GS) 20 (at 454, Branford CT, USA) and an additional 454 GS FLX Titanium
run (at Seq-IT, Kaiserslautern, Germany). Gaps were
closed manually in cooperation with LGC Genomics
(Berlin, Germany) by PCR followed by Sanger sequencing of the respective amplification products. The last
gap that constituted a second copy of a highly homologous P2-like prophage was closed by primer walking on
a single phage-spanning fosmid clone. Finally, the raw
data were assembled using the Newbler software (454
Life Sciences Corporation, Version Software Release 2.3)
into a complete genome sequence of 4,553,420 bp for
the genome and an additional 72,463 bp contig representing the pYVO3 plasmid. The complete genome
sequence of this strain has been published recently [17].
The draft high coverage genome sequences of three
other Y. enterocolitica ssp. palearctica strains of human
origin, Y8265 and Y5307 of serobiotype O:3/4 and
Y5,27P of serobiotype O:5,27/3 were obtained in cooperation with BGI-Hongkong Co., Hong Kong. We used
high-throughput Illumina sequencing technology to conduct paired-end sequencing for DNA samples, and constructed a 500 bp library with extended data of 500 Mb,
and a 6 kbp library with expected data of 250 Mb. Genome assembly results in 14 large scaffolds and 215 contigs for Y8265, 18 scaffolds and 256 contigs for Y5307,
and 20 scaffolds and 408 contigs for the Y5,27P strain.
Genome coverage based on k-mer exceeds 105%, and
genome coverage based on reads mapping was 97% for
the three genomes. The genome sequences were annotated using the RAST server [54]. Genome comparisons
have been done using SEED [55], the Artemis comparison tool [56], Mauve [57] and other standard comparison tools. SEED was also used to determine orthologous
proteins, using the standard parameters.
Accession numbers of strains used in this study are
listed in Table 3.

excised element (the second PCR covering about 420 bp)
followed by subsequent sequencing. The following oligonucleotides have been used (bold letters, reverse orientation oligonucleotides): JB470, agaatcggaaactttgaatggttt,
JB472, CACATCAGGCACTTCTCCAGG, and JB 471,
ttgagccgttaagagacatttgg, and JB473, TTAACAGAAATAG
CGCCCAT.
In the case of the PhiYep-3 excision, a single PCR
amplification step was sufficient for amplification of the
attP attachment site of the circular excised prophage
(about 500 bp, proven by subsequent sequencing of the
PCR product). For PhiYep-3, the following oligonucleotides have been used: JB606, GGCGTGTTGTGGATGTAAT and JB608, atgtcagtatatttggcgat. For PhiYep-3
dissemination analysis, 15 strains of serobiotype O:3/4
have been tested.
N-acetyl-galactosamine experiments

The 8.4 kbp aga-operon (Y11_11961-Y11_12031) has
been subcloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) using
the following oligonucleotides: JB506 cagcgtcgtacttgatgatttgc and JB507 ATCATCTGTTGGGCGACACG.
The aga-supplemented serobiotype O:8/1B strain was
grown in the presence of carbenicillin (300 μg/ml) to
maintain the plasmid, serobiotype O:3/4 and O:8/1B
wild type strains were cultivated without antibiotics.
M9 minimal medium supplemented with 1 mM
MgSO4 and 0.1 mM CaCl2 and the appropriate amino
sugars (0.2% of N-acetyl-galactosamine, N-acetyl-glucosamine, glucose and galactose) was used in all experiments. Tryptophan (Trp) was added (200 μg/ml) to
support sufficient Yersinia enterocolitica growth. The
bacteria were grown in 0.01 M glucose supplemented
M9 overnight (16-20 hours) as a preculture, pelleted
and washed with M9 without sugar additives. The
optical density was measured and all samples were
inoculated to the same OD 600 0.2-0.3. Experiments
were carried out in 10-20 ml M9 in 50 ml Falcon
tubes. The optical density of the cultures was measured after inoculation and 48 hours.
