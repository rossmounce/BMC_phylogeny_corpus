Identification, characterization, and comparative
genomic distribution of the HERV-K (HML-2)
group of human endogenous retroviruses
Ravi P Subramanian†, Julia H Wildschutte†, Crystal Russo and John M Coffin*

Abstract
Background: Integration of retroviral DNA into a germ cell may lead to a provirus that is transmitted vertically to
that host’s offspring as an endogenous retrovirus (ERV). In humans, ERVs (HERVs) comprise about 8% of the
genome, the vast majority of which are truncated and/or highly mutated and no longer encode functional genes.
The most recently active retroviruses that integrated into the human germ line are members of the Betaretroviruslike HERV-K (HML-2) group, many of which contain intact open reading frames (ORFs) in some or all genes,
sometimes encoding functional proteins that are expressed in various tissues. Interestingly, this expression is
upregulated in many tumors ranging from breast and ovarian tissues to lymphomas and melanomas, as well as
schizophrenia, rheumatoid arthritis, and other disorders.
Results: No study to date has characterized all HML-2 elements in the genome, an essential step towards
determining a possible functional role of HML-2 expression in disease. We present here the most comprehensive
and accurate catalog of all full-length and partial HML-2 proviruses, as well as solo LTR elements, within the
published human genome to date. Furthermore, we provide evidence for preferential maintenance of proviruses
and solo LTR elements on gene-rich chromosomes of the human genome and in proximity to gene regions.
Conclusions: Our analysis has found and corrected several errors in the annotation of HML-2 elements in the
human genome, including mislabeling of a newly identified group called HML-11. HML-elements have been
implicated in a wide array of diseases, and characterization of these elements will play a fundamental role to
understand the relationship between endogenous retrovirus expression and disease.
Keywords: evolution, endogenous retroviruses, human genome

Background
During the retrovirus infection cycle, viral genomic RNA
is reverse transcribed into a DNA copy that is permanently integrated into the genomic DNA of the host.
The integration of retroviral cDNA into the DNA of a
germ cell occasionally results in an endogenous retrovirus (ERV), a provirus that is transmitted vertically to
that host’s offspring, and which may become fixed in
the host species over time [1]. ERVs have been detected
thus far in every animal species tested, including
humans. ERVs contribute to approximately 8% of the

human genome [2,3], and the vast majority of human
ERVs (HERVs) lack infectious capacity due to accumulated nonsense mutations, insertions, and deletions of
internal coding regions and/or long terminal repeats
(LTRs). Despite the accumulation of deleterious mutations, a number of HERVs, most corresponding to relatively recent germline infections, have intact open
reading frames (ORFs) that encode functional proteins
and, in some cases, can form retrovirus-like particles
[4-9].
The HERV-K clade of betaretrovirus-like endogenous
retroviruses contains ten groups (HML-1-10) that are
most closely related to mouse mammary tumor virus
(MMTV), a causative agent for breast cancer in mice
[10]. The most recently active retroviruses belong to the

HML-2 group, which has been previously estimated to
comprise roughly 60 proviruses and more than 2500
solitary LTRs (solo LTRs), resulting from intra- or interLTR recombination events [11,12]. HML-2 proviruses
are further classified by the presence (type 1) or absence
(type 2) of a 292 bp deletion at the pol-env junction
[13], or based upon their LTR sequence [14]. Unique
among HERVs, the HML-2 group includes human-specific proviruses, of which 11 are known to be insertionally polymorphic within the population [8,15-17]. The
HML-2 insertion rate appears to have been approximately constant since the Homo-Pan divergence, suggesting that replication-competent HML-2 viruses may
yet exist within the human population [16,18]. Despite
the presence of replication-competent ERVs in other
vertebrates, no infectious HERV has been observed to
date. However, two engineered HML-2 proviruses, corresponding to the inferred common ancestor of the
human specific elements, are weakly infectious [19,20].
Expression of HML-2 proviruses is known to be upregulated in tissues associated with several diseases,
including breast cancers [21-25], germ cell tumors
[26-29], melanomas [30-33], ovarian cancer [34,35], leukemias/lymphomas [36,37], schizophrenia [38-41], and
rheumatoid arthritis [42-45], as well as during HIV
infection [46,47], in which transcripts, proteins, and
even retrovirus-like particles originating from HML-2
proviruses have been observed. However, any functional
consequences of this expression remain unknown. In
general, research directed toward identifying individually
expressed loci is limited, and knowledge of the specific
loci being transcribed, as well as the reason(s) for their
activation, are largely nonexistent. Just one study has
investigated expression of individual proviruses, providing evidence for the differential transcription of > 20
HML-2 proviruses in normal and tumor-derived human
tissues [28]. Although these approaches have provided
information on the expression patterns of some HML-2
proviruses, a caveat is that polymorphic HML-2 proviruses may be missed, as features that differentiate
these particular loci, such as sequence polymorphisms,
remain uncharacterized. A more complete and up-todate catalog of HML-2 elements will help to alleviate
such difficulties.
Since its initial publication in 2001 [3], the human
genome sequence has evolved through several builds.
These have provided a powerful means of identifying
and cataloging endogenous proviruses. However,
changes in defined genome coordinates from one build
to the next present a problem in confirming the genomic positions of specific sequences like HERVs, and
have complicated the use of existing literature for the
verification of individual HML-2 loci. Also, the fact that
some members of the HML-2 group are polymorphic

has led to their incomplete representation in the existing
genome sequence. For example, the K103 provirus
(located at chromosomal position 10p12.1) is represented as a solo LTR in all genome builds; however, the
provirus has been sequenced and is publicly available in
the NCBI nucleotide database [15]. Also missing from
the published sequence is HERV-K113, located at 19p12
and arguably the most studied HML-2 provirus [8,48].
Furthermore, additional polymorphic HML-2 proviruses
are likely to be identified with continued improvements
in sequencing technologies and increased genome
sequence information. Their characterization, in terms
of integration site, structure and function, and in association to disease, will require a systematic catalog of
described proviruses as a reference point for future
analyses.
Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of HML-2
elements present within human DNAs. Through iterative data searching of the most recent human genome
assembly (Feb. 2009 GRCh37/hg19), we have identified
and characterized 91 proviruses, and 944 solo LTRs
belonging to the HML-2 family. We have accounted for
all known polymorphic HML-2 proviruses, including
10p12.1 (K103) and 19p12b (K113). We have also
sequenced and included two previously uncharacterized
HML-2 proviruses: one at chromosomal position
12q13.2 represented in the published genome as a solo
LTR [16], and K105 [15], also published as a solo LTR
and located within an unassembled genomic region.
Finally, we have identified putative open reading frames
(ORFs) for proviruses and determined the age of provirus and solo LTR elements. Together, these data provide the most up-to-date catalog of HML-2 elements
within the human genome and represent, to our knowledge, the most complete and accurate dataset of its
kind.

Results
Generation of a comprehensive HML-2 dataset

We mined the most recent human genome assembly
(GRCh37/hg19) for sequences with strong similarity to
HERV-K113 provirus using the BLAST-like alignment
tool (BLAT) within the UCSC Genome Browser website
[49]. K113 is the most recent germ-line integration
known, with an allele frequency of ~16% and estimated
to have formed ~1 million years ago [8,50]. Though the
K113 provirus is not present in the published human
genome, we were able to identify it at chromosome band
19p12 using GenBank sequences that contained flanking
sequences (accession numbers: AF387849 and
AF387847). By searching for proviruses with the highest
percent identity to K113, we were able to identify 62 fulllength or near full-length proviruses with > 87% nucleotide identity to the full-length K113 genome (Table 1).

Hughes and Coffin [51], where identification is based
upon chromosome band location in the human genome. In the case of multiple proviruses in the same
chromosome band, we labeled each provirus with an
“a”, “b”, “c” etc. depending upon its order within the
band. To this list, an additional four polymorphic proviruses were added: K113 itself, K103 (at 10p12.1),
12q13.2, and K105 (located within the unassembled
centromeric region Un_g1000219) for an initial set of
66 proviruses. K103, K105, and 12q13.2 are represented in the current (and all previous) genome builds

as solo LTRs. Full-length sequences for the K103 and
K113 proviruses are available through GenBank
(AF164611 and AY037928 respectively). The sequence
of the K105 provirus was not included in the original
report due to its location within highly repetitive DNA
[15]; however, by examining the NCBI database we
identified a provirus, “K111”, that most likely represents human K105 (see Materials and Methods).
Finally, the 12q13.2 provirus was one of few polymorphic proviruses to be identified since publication
of the human genome [16], although its sequence was
not deposited in the NCBI database. We have analyzed

this provirus and provide its sequence for the first time
here.
We expanded our original search to detect HML-2
proviruses that did not yield a high identity to full
length K113, but still belonged to the HML-2 group.
Using BLAT, we identified individual gag, pro, pol, and
env genes and partial genes related to K113 in the
GRCh37/hg19 build with the criterion for provirus identification as having at least one LTR associated with
internal coding sequence in the same orientation. This
search recapitulated our initial BLAT hits from the full-

length K113 sequence and led to the cumulative identification of 17 additional elements (Table 2). Finally, we
included an additional 8 elements not identified in
BLAT searches but which have been classified according
to RepeatMasker within the UCSC Genome Browser as
“HERV-K”, indicating HML-2 provirus sequence (bolded
in Table 2), for a sum of 91 HML-2-related full-length
and near full-length proviruses in the human genome.
The inferred structure of each identified provirus is
shown schematically in Figure 1, in which the length,

retrovirus, including gag, pro, pol, and env gene positions. Splice sites of env, np9, and rec genes are also shown, with a faint gray band
indicating the type 1 deletion region. Proviruses of the LTR5Hs (B), LTR5A (C), and LTR5B (D) groups are depicted and color-coded according to
type. Type 1 proviruses colored in grey (with LTRs filled grey), type 2 colored in black (with LTRs filled black), and unclassified having open LTRs
colored grey. Insertions and deletions < 3 bases are depicted with blue and red flags respectively. Larger insertions of retroelements are labeled
according to type of element inserted, and large deletions are shown with dashed lines corresponding to missing sequence. Stop codons are
indicated with a grey flag. Daggers indicate human-specific proviruses, with double daggers indicating polymorphic proviruses.

codons are indicated for each provirus relative to the
K113 nucleotide sequence. The full-length nucleotide
alignment is provided in Additional File 1. In all, we
have generated an exhaustive dataset for the HML-2
group, adding 37 proviruses to the most recent report
[52], around 30 of which are described here for the first
time [5,8,11,15,51,53-55].
We conducted a separate analysis to identify HML-2
solo LTRs within the published genome. Solo LTRs are
generated via recombination between the LTRs of a single provirus, or through recombination between different proviruses. Although solo LTRs have lost the ability
to express viral gene products, their inherent promoter
activity can affect expression of neighboring genes
[9,56-59]. In general, estimates for the total number of
HML-2 solo LTRs in the published genome have varied
widely, from an original prediction of > 2500 [12] to the
most recent figure of ~1200 [60]. We used the UCSC
Genome Browser RepeatMasker algorithm, in which
HML-2 elements have been assigned within the published sequence by nucleotide similarity to RepBase definitions of HML-2 LTRs. Using our approach, we
identified 944 intact and nearly-intact HML-2 solo LTRs
within the GRCh37/hg19 build (excluding 3 solo LTRs
that represent polymorphic proviruses K105, K103, and
12q13.2) and used them to further characterize the
HML-2 group of HERVs (Additional File 2).
HML-2 subtype classification

HERV-K (HML-2) proviruses have been classified by
the presence (type 1) or absence (type 2) of a 292 bp
deletion at the pol-env junction [13]. Type 2 proviruses
encode the accessory protein Rec, involved in the
transport of unspliced mRNAs from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm and analogous to the HIV Rev and HTLV
Rex proteins [61-63]. The rec alternative splice site is
deleted within type 1 proviruses (as is a portion of the
env reading frame), resulting in mRNAs for a ~9 kDa
fusion protein referred to as Np9 (Figure 1A) [30,64].
Within the HML-2 group, the frequency of type 1 proviruses was previously estimated to be around 44%,
based on just 35 elements [11]. Of the 91 proviruses
analyzed here, we could conclusively assign 75, of
which 20 (~26%) were type 1 and 55 (~74%) were type
2 (Figure 1). The remaining 16 proviruses contained
larger deletions spanning the Δ292bp pol-env feature
used to differentiate the HML-2 subtypes and could
not be classified. Two proviruses, Xq28a and 1p36.21a,
are duplications of Xq28b and 1p36.21b/c respectively,
but neither has retained the 3’ ends due to truncating
mutation. For these particular elements, we propose
that the 1p36.21a and Xq28a proviruses are type 2 due
to the fact that they are duplications of other type 2
proviruses.

Page 8 of 22

We next analyzed type 1 and 2 frequencies with
respect to HML-2 LTR subgroups (Figure 1B, C, and
1D). HML-2 LTRs cluster into one of three subgroups
based on phylogeny and shared nucleotide features:
LTR5Hs, LTR5A, and LTR5B [11,14]. In general, the
LTR5Hs represent the most recent germline integrations
and are the only subgroup with human-specific proviruses while the other subgroups are from older integrations. We observed that type 1 proviruses were
exclusively found in the LTR5Hs subgroup and not in
the LTR5A or LTR5B subgroups (Figure 1). Of the 45
LTR5Hs proviruses, types 1 and 2 were roughly equally
represented, with 20 (~44%) and 17 (~38%) elements,
respectively (Figure 1B). By contrast, all of the analyzable LTR5B (17 proviruses, or ~84% of the subgroup)
and LTR5A (19, or ~90%) proviruses were type 2 (Figures 1C and 1D).
LTR-based analysis of HML-2 proviruses

Phylogenetic analysis of the LTRs of endogenous proviruses not only reveals their individual relationships
and grouping, but also provides useful insight into their
evolutionary history. Since the LTRs of a provirus must
be identical in sequence at the time of integration, terminal branches separating the 2 LTRs of each provirus on
such a tree reflect accumulated mutations since the time
of integration, whereas internal branches reflect evolution (mostly as a virus) prior to the final germline integration. Violations of this pattern reflect genomic
rearrangements, such as gene conversion and recombination [51,65,66]. To investigate the overall branching
patterns and evolutionary dynamics within the HML-2
group, we performed a phylogenetic analysis using Bayesian inference of the LTRs associated with individual
proviruses (data not shown). In all, this analysis included
LTRs from all proviruses identified, excluding the seven
without an associated LTR. The resulting phylogeny
revealed two major lineages, the first containing the
most recently formed proviruses with the longest internal branches and shortest terminal branches, including
all human-specific members and those with known polymorphic alleles. The second lineage included evolutionarily older proviruses, many of which are shared among
most primates [14,51]. Our tree topology is consistent
with previous reports [11,14,18,51] but includes at least
twice the number of provirus-associated LTRs, and thus
provides a more detailed representation for evolutionary
analyses of the HML-2 HERVs.
Overall, our classification largely agrees with the previous report defining the three major subgroups [14];
however, the larger sample size of our data set highlighted inconsistencies in the previous classification system. For example, the 8q11.1 and 4q13.2 proviruses are
each characterized by RepeatMasker as full-length

Subramanian et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:90
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/90

elements with LTRs belonging to different subgroups:
8q11.1 having a 5’ LTR5B and 3’ LTR5A, while the
opposite was reported for 4q13.2 (5’ LTR5A and 3’
LTR5B). We found that the direct repeats flanking the
edges of each provirus were intact and identical, suggesting that the proviruses were not generated through
recombination. Moreover, the LTRs from each provirus

predicted by RepBase [67] and subsequently re-analyzed
by sequence comparison to the group consensus. In a
sequence comparison of 1092 HML-2 LTRs, we successfully identified subgroup-specific features which we used
to discriminate the LTR5Hs, LTR5A, and LTR5B elements. We would like to note that previously described
sequence polymorphisms [14] were not observed among
all sequences in any subgroup, likely due to our large
sample size. With reference to the full-length alignment
(Additional File 1), we identified a 4 bp insertion at
positions 585 and 10718 in > 80% of all LTR5Hs, an
insertion at positions 806 and 10957 shared in > 99% of
LTR5A and B, and insertions unique for all LTR5A elements seen at positions 182 and 10317.
Using these subgroup-specific features, we classified
individual proviruses and analyzed their distribution
within the HML-2 group (Figure 2). The largest lineage
represented the more recent LTR5Hs subgroup (Figure
2A) with 45 proviruses (~50%). Of the other subgroups,
21 LTR5A (~24%) and 23 LTR5B (~26%) proviruses
were found (Figures 2B and 2C, respectively). We
hypothesized that each subgroup would have arisen
independently, so we attempted to formulate phylogenetic trees of each subgroup using the other subgroups
as outgroups. This approach was successful for LTR5Hs
and LTR5A trees (Figures 2A and 2B), but not for
LTR5B (Figure 2C). As seen in Figure 2C, a tree of
LTR5B sequences rooted on LTR5Hs sequences has 5A
sequences nested within the 5B sequences (and vice
versa for a tree rooted on 5Hs sequences). We concluded that the LTR5B subgroup is the oldest (Figure
2B) and ancestral to the other two subgroups, each of
which arose independently and uniquely from viruses of
the LTR5B group.
The LTR5A subgroup of proviruses contains a wellsupported clade comprising two clusters, the first represented by proviruses at 4p16.1b, 8p23.1b, c, and d, and
11p15.4, and the other by 4p16.1a and 4p16.3b (labeled
in Figure 2B). The 5’ LTRs within each cluster group
together, as do the 3’ LTRs, suggesting an initial duplication of a single integrated provirus to sites on different chromosomes, each of which was subsequently
amplified locally to generate each cluster. Overall, the
elements within this clade share several sequence features, such as short insertions/deletions and single base
changes relative to K113 (indicated in Figure 1 and
1detailed in Additional File 1), and have high overall
nucleotide identity (96.2% within the group). More specifically, the 8p23.1b, c, and d proviruses exceed 99.9%
identity, and are more than 95% identical to the
11p15.4, 4p16.1, and 4p16.3 proviruses. Not surprisingly,
we observed > 1kb of cellular DNA flanking each provirus shared the same level of nucleotide identity (data
not shown), demonstrating that these elements arose, at

Page 10 of 22

least in part, via repeated large-scale duplication, most
likely mediated by some element outside the provirus
itself. Clustering within the pol-, gag- and env-based
trees also lends support for the subgroup’s history (Figures 3 and 4). Also within the LTR5B group, a similar
pattern is observed, specifically leading to the Xq28a
and b, and the 1p36.21a, b, and c clusters (also indicated
in Figure 2C).

Figure 4 Phylogenetic analysis of gag and env genes. Bayesian inference trees were generated for the first ~1800 bp of gag (A), as well as
the SU portion of env (B). Trees were rooted using the 17p13.1 provirus sequence as an out-group, with posterior probabilities above 80 shown.
Sequences are color-coded according to LTR group, with type 1 proviruses indicated with filled diamonds, and undetermined types with open
diamonds. All other proviruses shown are type 2.

Gene-based phylogenies of HML-2 proviruses

We analyzed all identified proviruses phylogenetically
to support their classification in the HML-2 group,
and to determine their relationship to one another and
more distantly related HERV-K elements. In the tree
shown in Figure 3, we compared a region of the pol
gene present in most of the proviruses in our dataset
(65 in all) with representative members of HERV-K
groups HML-1 through HML-10 and the exogenous
betaretroviruses: mouse mammary tumor virus
(MMTV), Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV), and
Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV). Within the polbased phylogeny, the HML-2 proviruses form a distinct
lineage (Figure 3), with the most recent integrations
near the tips of the tree and consistent with the
observed phylogeny based on the LTRs (Figure 2).
Superimposition of the HML-2 subtypes onto each
phylogeny revealed a skewed distribution of type 1
proviruses, which are predominantly within the
LTR5Hs group (filled diamonds), also consistent with
our initial subtype classification (Figure 1). The
observed polyphyletic distribution of type 1 proviruses
as previously reported [11,14], might reflect gene conversion events post-integration [13], or could be due to
rescue of the inherently noninfectious type 1 genomes

by coexpressed type 2 proviruses followed by frequent
recombination between the two. However, the lack of
gene conversion in 5Hs LTRs and the frequency of
type 1 integrations in the last 5 million years suggest
that exogenous recombination prior to integration in
the germ line is the most likely explanation.
To account for the remaining HML-2 sequences not
included in the pol-based phylogeny, we performed a
Bayesian inference analysis using the first ~1.8 kb of the
gag reading frame as well as the first ~1 kb of env corresponding to the SU region (Figure 4). In each phylogeny, the proviruses we identified grouped together into
a well-supported clade with other previously described
HML-2 elements. There were two exceptions, namely
for proviruses located at 8p22 and 17p13.1, which
together formed a distinct group within the pol-based
tree. Both were classified by RepeatMasker as HML-2,
and have been included in our current HML-2 dataset
(Table 2); however, we speculate that the proviruses
represent a previously unrecognized HML group. It is
unlikely that these elements arose out of recombination
of HML-2 elements with non-HML-2 elements, as the
dissimilarity exists throughout the genome of these proviruses. With the exception of 17p13.1 and 8p22, we
were unable to align non-HML-2 betaretrovirus-like

Subramanian et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:90
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/90

sequences to either the SU or gag regions of HML-2,
providing further support that 89 proviruses identified
belong exclusively to HML-2. Though 17p13.1 and 8p22
were capable of being aligned, they were found to be so
distant in sequence that they cannot represent HML-2
elements, but instead must be representative of a group
of proviruses that is a close cousin to HML-2, which we
term HML-11.
Interestingly, the LTR5Hs provirus located on 3q12.3
was found to be most similar on the pol tree to
22q11.23, an LTR5B provirus (Figure 3). However, when
compared to gag and env sequences (Figure 4), 3q12.3
grouped with the LTR5Hs sequences, and it would
appear that it is a recombinant provirus within the gag
and pol genes. We identified break points between positions 2710 to 5102 with LTR5B proviruses as well as
5465 to 6390 (data not shown). A possible explanation
of these results is that the 3q12.3 is an integration of a
recombinant virus intermediate to LTR5Hs and LTR5B.
Evolutionary dynamics of the HML-2 group

We, and others, have previously established that past
recombination events between proviruses can be
inferred through phylogenetic analysis of paired LTRs
[18,51,65]. The LTRs of an individual provirus are identical at the time of integration and subsequently evolve
independently. As a result, the 5’ and 3’ LTRs from a
single provirus will be more similar to one another than
those of any other element, and each pair will form a
distinct phylogenetic group. Recombination after integration can be inferred by violation of this property,
resulting in non-paired 5’ and 3’ LTRs for a given provirus. We examined the LTR-based phylogeny for evidence of recombination, with close attention to those
proviruses that were previously unreported. We
observed 6 examples of non-paired 5’ and 3’ LTRs, specifically from proviruses located at 3p25.3, 8p23.1a,
11q12.3, 19p12a, 19p12c and 19q13.12b (indicated by
open diamonds at the branch termini in Figure 2),
although not in the case of any of the previously
uncharacterized HML-2 elements. The 6 proviruses with
non-paired LTRs that we observed were similar in chromosomal location to those originally reported in 2001
[8,51], and we confirmed their identity by BLAT searching the nucleotide sequence of each provirus from our
dataset to the earliest available human genome build
(July 2003, NCBI34/hg16) (data not shown).
Estimation of the relative ages of individual HML-2

Because the LTRs are identical at the time of integration, the number of differences between the LTRs can
be used to infer the relative age of a provirus. The ages
of HML-2 proviruses as a function of LTR subgroup
were previously estimated by Buzdin et al. based on the

Page 12 of 22

intrabranch divergence between individual elements
from the subgroup consensus. Their analysis of ~40
LTRs estimated that the LTR5A and 5B subgroups
formed around 5.8 and 10.3 million years ago (mya),
respectively [14], with 5A originating from 5B. These
are fairly recent estimates for these subgroups, given
that most LTR5A and 5B proviruses have shared loci
among primates whose divergence from humans substantially predates this timeframe. This underestimation
is likely due to faulty molecular clock assumptions as
well as the use of relatively few proviruses from early
sequence builds. Using the HML-2 elements within our
dataset, we estimated the time of integration for each 2LTR HML-2 element using a previously described
method [66,68] in which divergence between LTRs is
normalized to a standard mutation rate of 0.24-0.45%
per million years. In total, we were able to place age
estimates to 49 HML-2 proviruses, provided in Tables 1
and 2. We decided that we could not accurately determine the time of recent provirus integrations (those elements with lower bound estimates below 2 million years
ago), so these proviruses are listed as “< 2” in Table 1.
But it is worth mentioning that our age estimates are
similar to those seen by Jha et al. [50,69]. On average,
LTR5Hs proviruses were estimated to have formed ~9.1
mya for all proviruses: ~2.7 (± 1.1) mya for those specific to humans. Consistent with the LTR-based and internal-based phylogenies (Figures 2, 3, and 4) we found the
LTR5A and LTR5B proviruses to have formed earlier,
around ~20.1 (± 5.4) mya and ~27.9 (± 12.0) mya,
respectively.
We developed a new algorithm to calculate age of solo
LTRs and proviruses with only one LTR. We grouped
LTRs based on the subgroup-specific features described
above, and then determined the divergence of each LTR
to a subgroup consensus. This was then normalized
using an average mutation rate (0.34% per million years)
as for the provirus molecular clock. Ages for each solo
LTR element can be seen in Additional File 2. We were
initially concerned that our solo LTR age calculation
would be biased by mutations between proviruses prior
to integration or as a function of recombination to produce the solo LTR elements. However, when we compared the age calculation of solo LTR elements for each
subgroup ("Solo LTR”, Figure 5) to provirus age calculations ("Provirus”, Figure 5), we found comparable age
distributions. Furthermore, when we performed comparative genomics on a subset of solo LTR elements to
determine whether our age calculation corresponded to
presence of the element in the appropriate genomes we
found an accuracy of 50-60% using our solo LTR age
calculation algorithm. In contrast, when we examined
distribution of proviruses whose age was determined
using the 5’ to 3’ divergence method in the appropriate

some HML-2 elements are still active as viruses [29],
none have been found to date.

Figure 5 Age of HML-2 LTRs. LTRs from 5Hs, 5A, and 5B
subgroups were used to determine distance measurements as a
function of time of integration. Ages of “Solo LTR” elements were
determined as described in Methods, while “Provirus” element ages
were determined by 5’ to 3’ distance measurement. “Human
Specific 5Hs” refers to solo LTRs that are only found in the human
genome, and whose age was calculated using the solo LTR age
calculation method.

genomes, we only had an accuracy of 40%. Together this
supports our approach to calculate age of solo LTR elements in the genome, and implies that there is little
divergence within a subgroup of closely related proviruses at time of integration. This methodology will
enhance our ability to study the chronology of endogenous retrovirus integration in the genome.
Comparing the relative ages of LTRs revealed several
trends in the evolutionary activity within each subgroup
(Figure 5). We report for the first time that LTR5Hs
represents a broad subgroup that has continuously been
integrating into the germline for the last 20 million
years. We found that 5Hs provirus integrations predominantly (~50% of all integrations) occurred between 618 mya. The trends we observed for the LTR5Hs elements were in contrast to the patterns of activity we
saw for the LTR5A and LTR5B subgroups, which have a
narrower timeframe of activity, with the LTR5A ranging
from ~15-21 mya, and LTR5B from ~19-25 mya. This
observation is consistent with LTR5Hs retaining activity
throughout primate evolution, and the LTR5A and
LTR5B subgroups having become extinct prior to the
Homo divergence. Overall, these data provide an estimate for individual HML-2 provirus formation, and suggest that the subgroups co-existed at least during the
early evolution of primates, but that only the LTR5Hs
group retained access to the germline along the lineage

We initially sought to determine the association of
HML-2 elements with respect to gene regions, as we
hypothesized that HML-2 viruses preferentially integrate
in or near gene regions like MLV and HIV [70]. We
found that ~60% of all elements were found in or within
30 kb of gene regions (data not shown). Interestingly,
~20% of all elements were present within introns inside
genes and ~80% of those elements inside genes were in
the antisense orientation, which corroborates the notion
that HML-2 integrations inside genes are selected
against unless they are present in an antisense orientation [60].
We wanted to determine whether the gene bias for
HML-2 integrations in provirus or solo LTR form correlated with gene density on any given chromosome. To
address this question, we investigated the respective distributions of HML-2 proviruses and solo LTRs as a
function of chromosome size (total bases) or RefSeq
gene density for each chromosome (Figure 6). Values
for total proviruses and solo LTRs were from the HML2 dataset presented in this study, and values for chromosomal size and gene density were extracted using the
Base Position and RefSeq Genes tracks within UCSC
Genome Browser, respectively. For each pairwise set,
expected frequencies were predicted using a negative
binomial regression analysis and compared to the
observed frequencies using a c2 analysis (p-values provided in each panel in Figure 6). In general, our results
indicate that, though statistically significant, chromosome size is a relatively weak predictor of the frequencies of proviruses, or gene density (Figures 6A and 6G).
Also relatively weak is the relationship between gene
density and provirus frequency per chromosome (Figures 6C and 6I). However, we did find provirus and solo
LTR frequencies per chromosome (Figures 6B and 6E)
to be relatively strong predictors of one another, as
expected. We also observed a strong relationship
between chromosomal gene density and solo LTR frequency (Figures 6F and 6H), but not for proviruses. A
possible explanation for this discrepancy would be selection against endogenized proviruses with respect to
genes forcing either conversion to solo LTR elements or
loss from the genome.
Because our relationships describe each other well, we
were able to observe that a few chromosomes were
over- or under-represented in proviruses, solo LTRs, or
RefSeq genes. This relationship was determined by identifying outliers of varying position and magnitude with
respect to the regression. For example, our results

Figure 6 Relationships between chromosome size, solo LTR, provirus or RefSeq gene frequency. Binomial regression analysis was
performed using chromosome size (A), solo LTR frequency (B), or RefSeq gene frequency (C) as a predictor of provirus frequency; or predicting
solo LTR frequency using chromosome size (D), provirus frequency (E), or RefSeq gene frequency (F); or predicting RefSeq gene frequency using
chromosome size (G), solo LTR frequency (H), or provirus frequency (I). The bold line represents mean correlation, with 95% confidence intervals
shown with dashed lines. P-values are shown for each plot.

indicate that chromosome 19 is particularly dense in
both proviruses and solo LTRs (Figures 6A and 6D) as
well as genes (Figure 6G). This correlation is consistent
with a previously described trend of HERV over-representation on this chromosome, as well as preferential
integration by HIV and MLV [70,71], a phenomenon
suggested to result from multiple segmental duplications

[72]. Interestingly, the same study found chromosome Y
enriched in overall HERV content, however we did not
observe this trend when considering HML-2 alone (Figures 6A and 6D). Other outliers include chromosome 4,
which appears somewhat enriched in solo LTRs with
respect to gene density, whereas chromosomes 15, 16,
and 17 are deficient in solo LTRs in the same respect

Subramanian et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:90
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/90

(Figures 6F and 6H). Interestingly, chromosome 17 is
relatively gene-rich (Figure 6G), but is devoid of HML-2
proviruses and solo LTRs, implying a selective pressure
against HML-2 integration or maintenance on this chromosome. This observation is in contrast to the trend we
observed for chromosome 19 as discussed above (Figure
6G). As shown in Figures 6B and 6E, the equilibrium
between proviruses and solo LTRs is a relatively strong
fit (p < 0.0001 in either direction). Exceptions are chromosome 8, which is relatively provirus-rich compared to
solo LTRs (Figure 6B), and chromosome 2, for which
the opposite trend is observed (Figure 6E). Possibly,
these outliers are indicators of specific chromosomes
that either preferentially maintain proviruses (i.e., chromosome 8), or for which there exists a heavy selective
pressure for recombination leading to solo LTR formation (i.e., chromosome 2). Though, it remains to be seen
if these results are a general trend for HERV representation in the genome or if these are HML-2 specific
results.

Discussion
This report comprises the most complete and up-todate analysis of HML-2 proviruses and solo LTRs that
can be found in the published human genome. The
HML-2 group comprises the most recent integrations of
endogenous retroviruses in humans, and includes many
members that are polymorphic within the species. It has
been hypothesized that these endogenous elements
represent the closest relatives of extant exogenous betaretroviruses that may retain the capacity to infect
humans [16,18]. These putative exogenous viruses have
a proposed role in breast cancer as well as biliary cirrhosis, although no such virus has been convincingly
detected [73-75]. Based on expression patterns, many
groups have also suggested a role for endogenous HML2 proviruses in various diseases from breast, ovarian,
and skin cancers, to schizophrenia and arthritis
[21,24,28,34,39,44,76]; however, a functional link to
these diseases also remains to be established. Despite
the mounting evidence suggesting a clinically significant
role for HML-2 proviruses in disease, it is surprising
that no study has yet fully described all HML-2 proviruses in the published human genome. As it is unlikely
that each provirus equally contributes to every disease
to which HML-2 expression is associated, identification
of which provirus is expressed in these diseases remains
impossible unless all known proviruses are
characterized.
Here, we have identified and characterized 91 provirus
elements present in the human genome, adding almost
30 more than have been previously described. We have
also identified 944 solo LTR elements, over 1500 fewer
than previously expected in the human genome [12],

Page 15 of 22

and 300 fewer than the closest suggested estimate [60].
Discrepancies between our estimate of solo LTR number
and that published previously [60] are likely due to our
exclusion of elements that are not full length or near
full length (> 750 bp). It is unlikely that this variance is
due to differences in genomic builds, as when we compared the build used previously to the current build
using the same criteria, we found the same number of
solo LTR elements in both builds, and not the number
reported previously (data not shown). While we believe
our list is as comprehensive and as thorough as possible,
it has excluded for the benefit of accuracy many partial
provirus elements that lack sufficient sequence to determine their grouping within HERV-K elements. Also,
there are at least 4 provirus elements not present in the
human genome as full-length elements, due to their
polymorphism. Therefore, it is very likely that 89 is an
underestimation of the actual number of HML-2 proviruses, but it is the best approximation available to
date. Previous groups have attempted to compile a list
of HML-2 proviruses in humans, but the closest identification of all HML-2 proviruses in humans was only able
to identify 54 proviruses, and many of the loci have
changed since the publication of this report [52].
Because of the inherent ambiguity of genomic builds,
it becomes increasingly important to develop a standard
for HML-2 provirus identification. Previous publications
reporting HML-2 proviruses in the human genome
include accession numbers referencing these proviruses
corresponding to BACs, which provide little to no useful
information about the proviruses described. Therefore,
comparing information on HML-2 proviruses becomes
difficult as different groups use different nomenclature
to define proviruses, and many use different accession
numbers for the same provirus, as multiple BACs may
contain the same locus. Finally, some accession numbers
are for BACs that include more than one provirus
[11,51]. This confusion can be reduced through a few
measures that this study provides: 1) deposition of all
HML-2 sequences identified and their flanking
sequences into GenBank; 2) standardization of HML-2
nomenclature; 3) subclassification of HML-2 for functional studies; 4) thorough analyses of all HML groups
to define criteria for what qualifies a new element to
belong to an existing group. Here, we have created a
database of HML-2 provirus and flanking sequence that
has been deposited into GenBank as well as clearly
defined properties for all known HML-2 elements.
Although attempts have been made to standardize
nomenclature for HERVs using tRNA primer as defining
characteristic [77,78], we believe that for the HERV-K
elements this does not make sense. HML-5 has a
sequence that suggests priming from a Met tRNA, suggesting it belongs to a HERV-M group, despite being

Subramanian et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:90
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/90

closely related to HERV-K [77]. Many elements may
lack or have mutated primer-binding sites precluding it
from classification using this system. Therefore, while
we do believe it is necessary for having a standardization
of nomenclature for HERVs in the genome, we propose
that all betaretrovirus-like elements be identified as
HML-X (where “X” is 1-11, based upon phylogenetic
similarity to known HML groups) followed by their
locus on the human chromosome. An example from
this study would be HML-2(3q12.3). While this nomenclature is limited to human genomes, it does provide a
useful reference point when analyzing betaretrovirus-like
ERVs in non-human primates. Further work is necessary
for defining properties of all endogenous retroviruses in
the human genome.
It seems likely that most HML-2 proviruses are the
result of independent integration events that have been
preserved within the genome. However, there are 17 elements that are in the genome as a consequence of transposition events that include both a complete provirus
and at least 1500 kb of flanking DNA. Based upon our
estimates, these proviruses have been in the genomes of
primates for 20-30 million years, though it is likely that
these transpositional events occurred very recently,
approximately around the split of humans and chimpanzees (~5.5 mya [68]). This is seen by the incomplete
expansion of elements 8p23.1d and 11p15.4 which do
not have a corresponding provirus in chimps, while
8p23.1c and 8p23.1b do. The expansion of elements in
the Xq28 locus corresponds to gene duplication of the
cancer testis antigen 1 (CTAG1) into CTAG1A and
CTAG1B; both CTAG1A and CTAG1B are exclusively
expressed in malignant tissues or normal testis [79],
which is the same expression pattern of HML-2 proviruses. This gene duplication is present in the chimpanzee, human, and orangutan published genomes, but not
rhesus genome, consistent with the estimated integration time of the Xq28b provirus (~21 mya). The duplications in 1p36.21 are found within the PRAMEF gene
cluster, comprising genes that are closely related to
PRAME, another gene that is exclusively expressed in
malignant tissues or normal testis [80]. The duplicated
5A elements are all flanked by hypothetical proteins,
therefore it remains to be seen what the significance of
this expansion is. Nevertheless, it is interesting that the
same element, along with flanking sequence was transposed multiple times, while most other elements were
not; this strongly implies that the transposition is due to
some element in the flanking DNA, not the provirus
itself. This pattern contrasts with the ERV9 family of
endogenous retroviruses, which have continued retrotranspositional activity within the genome since the
hominid divergence within the primate lineage [81].

We have reclassified the different subgroups of HML2 proviruses based upon unique signatures of our 1087
HML-2 LTR sequences (947 solo LTRs and 140 provirus-associated LTRs). We did not observe the
sequence polymorphisms within subgroups of our
sequences as previously used to define the groups [14],
likely due to our much larger sample set. However, we
did observe an LTR5Hs-specific 4 base insertion at position 585 and 10718 of the HML-2 provirus alignment
(Additional File 1), which was found in ~80% of all
LTR5Hs proviruses. LTR5A/Bs also have a unique insertion at positions 806/10957, which is found in all
LTR5A/B sequences, but none of LTR5Hs. Furthermore,
LTR5A can be identified by unique insertions at positions 182/10317. All of the figures in this publication
are reflections of our definitions of LTR grouping, rather
than previously inaccurate groupings. It should be noted
that our reclassification of LTR is significant in categorizing viruses, as all of our phylogenetic trees (Figures 3
and 4) of provirus genes confirms monophyly of subgroups. As such, we feel our method of grouping LTRs
is a rigorous and predictive method to identify HML-2
elements in future sequenced genomes.
It is of interest that proviruses and solo LTRs appear
to have been differentially maintained within the genome. Under a neutral model of evolution, one would
imagine that there should be approximately the same
proportion of proviruses and solo LTR elements to size
of chromosome or gene density of any given chromosome. In general, this principle holds true, though four
chromosomes stand out - chromosomes 2, 4, 8, and 17.
While chromosomes 2 and 17 are gene rich, they are
relatively devoid of both proviral and solo LTR elements. Conversely, chromosomes 4 and 8 are seemingly
enriched in HML-2 elements compared to RefSeq genes.
Furthermore, we observed an enrichment of proviruses
compared to solo LTRs on chromosome 8, and an
enrichment of solo LTRs compared to proviruses on
chromosome 2. A possible explanation for this would be
that human chromosome 2 is a product of fusion of two
smaller chromosomes in other primates. When this
fusion event took place, it is conceivable that the recombination of many highly similar DNA sequences
occurred leading to production of more solo LTRs than
proviruses on this chromosome. It is difficult to determine if this is the case as most non-human primate genomes are unfinished and many proviral loci are not
assigned to any given chromosome. Initial analysis identified one provirus on Chromosome 2a and 2b in chimpanzee and at least 5 proviruses in orangutan (data not
shown). Further drafts of non-human primate genomes
are necessary for this type of analysis to be performed
in other species.

Subramanian et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:90

The significance of the increased ratio of proviruses to
solo LTRs on chromosome 8 is unclear, although the
distribution may simply be skewed by the expansion in
the 8p23.1 locus. Removal of two proviruses on chromosome 8 puts the point within the 95% confidence interval of the solo LTR-provirus correlation. Nevertheless,
our study shows that endogenous retroviruses can be
used to study genome evolution, as they are present in
numbers sufficiently large to be informative, but much
more manageable than SINE or LINE elements. Finally,
the strong correlation of HML-2 elements and gene
regions, may reflect a propensity to integrate in such
regions [71], or, conceivably some sort of protection
against mechanisms designed to remove transposable
elements [82]. However, this conclusion may be an oversimplification of a more complicated mechanism of regulating repetitive elements within the genome. The fact
that so many elements are maintained in or near genes
may provide a partial explanation for the correlation of
HML-2 gene expression with various disease states.
While disease association of HML-2 proviruses is controversial, many believe that HML-2 expression in diseased tissue is a byproduct of cellular dysfunction.
Others have argued that exogenous retroviruses may
recombine with homologous endogenously expressed
HML-2 elements yielding infectious viruses that cause
disease. This study is also the first to thoroughly identify
and characterize all available human HML-2 proviruses.
Correlation of HML-2 expression to disease onset is
well-supported, and suggests that provirus expression
may be a useful biomarker for certain diseases, particularly breast cancer, where no useful diagnostic marker
currently exists [83]. Here, we have provided a list of
provirus open reading frames (Tables 1 and 2) that may
represent putative targets for detection of disease using
HML-2 proteins or mRNA transcripts as biomarkers.
We are also making available complete files of the
sequences identified through deposition in Genbank
(accession numbers: JN675007-JN675097) along with
flanking sequences (accession numbers: JN675098JN675187). Finally, we have aligned these sequences
(Additional File 1) and proved them as a useful reference that can be viewed using any sequence viewing
software. These steps should prove helpful in identifying
and categorizing HML-2 expression in disease and
assigning sequences detected to specific proviruses and,
therefore, chromosomal locations.
Two genes not analyzed for expression are np9 and
rec, alternative splice products of type 1 and type 2 env
genes, respectively. Although rec transcripts are found
in normal and cancer tissues, np9 mRNA has only been
detected in tumor tissue, as is observed in tissues from
mammary carcinoma biopsies, suggesting a possible role
in tumorigenesis [64,84,85]. The type 1 proviruses all

Page 17 of 22

belong to the LTR5Hs subgroup, the most recent subgroup of HML-2 elements in the genome. Six of the 20
type 1 proviruses contain open reading frames for the
env gene without having the 292 bp sequence for
expressing functional Env. It is possible that the retention of an open reading frame in the remaining env
sequence plays some role in the disease association of
HML-2 proviruses.
The observations that type 1 proviruses are found
almost exclusively within the LTR5Hs group of proviruses but are not monophyletic, combined with their
patent incompetence for independent replication, are
most consistent with their arising repeatedly by gene
conversion of existing proviruses or by recombination
between genomes arising from replication competent
type 2 proviruses during reverse transcription prior to
integration. Of these two models, recombination during
reverse transcription is by far the more likely. First, if
gene conversion post-integration was so frequent, it
would also be seen in other parts of the genome, particularly in the LTR, where it is readily detected
[53,65,66]. However, such events, although they can be
detected over evolutionary time, are quite infrequent for
HML-2 proviruses [86]. By contrast, recombination during reverse transcription of copackaged RNA genomes is
the rule during retrovirus replication, and averages of 510 crossovers per genome per replication cycle have
been estimated. Since all initial integrations almost certainly arose from infection of the germ line by an HML2 virus produced by a somatic cell, which also contained
and expressed type 1 proviruses, the heterozygous virions necessary for recombinant formation would have
been very frequent, and such recombinants would arise
at high frequency. An interesting topic for speculation is
whether the deletion itself or the Np9 protein that
results from it promotes this process in some way, for
example by causing higher levels of expression of type 1
genome RNA.
The polymorphic nature of HML-2 proviruses may
play an important role in the polymorphism of diseases
with which they are associated. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proven very useful for correlating single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to
various diseases [87]. We attempted to determine if
there were any proviruses or solo LTR elements present
between SNPs shown to be involved in disease; however,
we did not identify any proviruses that were linked to
disease-associated SNPs (data not shown). This result
does not preclude the possibility of association of polymorphic proviruses not present in the published genome
with these SNPs. Also, many SNPs found on repetitive
elements like proviruses are precluded from GWAS analysis, thereby eliminating the possibility of studying disease association of polymorphic proviruses. The

Subramanian et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:90
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/90

abundance of solo LTRs and proviruses in close proximity to genes would indicate that there is some protection for these elements within the genome. For that
matter, dysregulation of solo LTR formation and recombination of proviruses might play an important role in
disease.

Conclusions
Our analysis of the completed published human genome
sequence has identified 89 HML-2 elements, over 30
more than previously described, as well as a new group
of HML endogenous retroviruses (HML-11). We have
catalogued and estimated the time of integration of
these elements as well as providing an algorithm to
identify time of integration of almost 1000 solo LTR elements. Integration of HML-2 elements appears to have
occurred and been preserved in or near gene regions,
much like MLV and HIV. Our analysis has restructured
the classification of HML-2 elements and provides a
useful tool for the future analysis of human endogenous
retroviruses in evolution as well as their role in human
disease.
Materials and methods
In silico identification of HML-2 proviruses and solo LTR
elements

To identify the chromosomal coordinates of HML-2
proviruses in human DNA, we searched the most recent
genome build (GRCh37/hg19, February 2009) using the
UCSC BLAT program [49] for sequences related to the
full-length nucleotide sequence of the K113 provirus
(AY037928) [16,49]. The DNA flanking individual ‘hits’
was manually searched for sequence with high similarity
to prototypical HML-2 sequences as determined by the
RepeatMasker program in the UCSC genome browser
[67]. For each identified locus, complete nucleotide
sequences were generated by extracting and concatenating the internal and LTR proviral segments. Additional
BLAT searches with individual K113 genes (gag, pro,
pol, and env) were performed to further identify HML-2
elements within the available genome. Complete
sequence reconstruction was performed as above, with
the minimum criterion for a provirus being the presence
of an LTR and a “hit” matching > 50% of the length of a
full gene, or two proximal genes with > 50% hits and no
LTR. All full-length sequences were initially aligned to
K113 using ClustalW [88], and manually edited in BioEdit v.7.0.9.0 [89]. The full-length sequences for the
HML-2 proviruses located at 10p12.1 (K103) and 19p12
(K113) were from NCBI (accession numbers AF164611
and AY037928, respectively). We identified the K105
sequence by taking flanking sequence of the K105 solo
LTR and searching the chimpanzee database. We identified a BAC with a provirus starting at position 74813

Page 18 of 22

(AC195095.2). We found a sequence with 99% similarity
through a BLAST search of the NCBI database that corresponded to a human provirus labeled K111
(GU476554). Due to the high similarity between Chimpanzee K105 and this human “K111” as well as similarity between K105 deposited 5’ and 3’ LTRs
(AH008413.1), we conclude that K111 is the human variant of the K105 provirus. Furthermore, the K111 provirus clusters most closely with chimpanzee K105 in
phylogenetic trees of gag, pol, and env, as well as chimp
and human published K105 5’ and 3’ LTR sequences
(data not shown). The 12q13.2 provirus was sequenced
in this study (described below). Provirus sequences were
deposited into GenBank (accession numbers: JN675007JN675097), along with their respective flanking
sequences (accession numbers: JN675098-JN675187).
Separate searches were performed using the UCSC
Genome Browser to identify chromosomal coordinates
of HML-2 solo LTRs. We queried the published
sequence for elements corresponding to one of three
HML-2 LTR subgroups: LTR5Hs (canonical sequence is
~986 bp); LTR5A (~1004 bp); or LTR5B (~1002 bp).
Sequences corresponding to solo LTRs were extracted,
aligned using ClustalW, and manually edited in BioEdit
v.7.0.9.0 as described above. LTRs associated, and in the
same orientation, with internal HML-2 gene sequences,
were excluded from this analysis to ensure that only
solo LTRs were analyzed. For the remaining elements,
an arbitrary cut-off of 750 bp was used to include only
the most intact elements per group.
Amplification and sequencing of the HML-2 12q13.2
provirus

The 12q13.2 solo LTR was identified in a BLAT search
for K113 5’LTR related sequences in the human genome
and verified by simultaneously searching the previously
characterized 12q13.2-specific flanking sequence [16].
12q13.2-specific primers were designed using Primer3
v.0.4.0 [90] for this sequence including 1 kb flanking
DNA in both directions (12q13.2F: 5’-TAGGTCTAGCACACTTTATCTGTAAT-3’; 12q13.2R: 5’AGATGTCT
CCATGTTAATTGC TC-3’). A panel of human DNAs
[91] was screened in two PCR reactions: the first was
with 12q13.2-flanking primers to detect individuals with
either the solo LTR or pre-integration site; the second
PCR was with the 12q13.2F primer and an HML-2-specific reverse primer (HML-2R: 5’-CTCGAGCGTACCTTCACCCTAG-3’) to detect the 12q13.2 5’ LTR.
PCR reactions were analyzed by gel electrophoresis.
Genomic DNA from one homozygous individual was
selected for sequencing the full-length 12q13.2 provirus.
The provirus was amplified in 4 overlapping segments
using conserved primers internal to the provirus [15]
paired with either 12q13.2F or 12q13.2R (PicoMaxx,

Subramanian et al. Retrovirology 2011, 8:90
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/8/1/90

Stratagene). PCR products were purified (Qiagen) and
sequenced to at least 6x coverage using a previously
described HML-2 primer set [15]. Individual sequence
traces were manually edited and aligned with reference
to the K113 nucleotide sequence in BioEdit v.7.0.9.0
[89], and the consensus sequence manually introduced
into our HML-2 alignment (Additional File 1).
Phylogenetic analyses

Within the HML-2 alignment, sequences corresponding
to gag (position 1083-3168 with respect to the HML-2

and env (position 8296-9252) were extracted for phylogenetic analysis. Individual HML-2 pol sequences were
aligned with known non-HML-2 pol sequences to confirm the identity of proviruses to HML-2 group. Full
length sequences representing non-HML-2 HERV-Ks
were retrieved using UCSC BLAT based upon the GenBank accession numbers: HML-1 (U35102, U35103,
U35157, AF015999), HML-2 (U35104-U35107, U35158,
AF015994),
HML-3
(U35153-U35156,U35159,
AF015998), HML-4 (U35160,), HML-5 (U35161,
AF015995), HML-6 (U35162-U35164, AF015997), HML7 (AF016000), HML-8 (AF015996), HML-9 (AF016001),
HML-10 (U07856). Full-length MMTV (NC_001503),
JSRV (M80216), and MPMV (NC_001550) genomes were
also aligned to this region. Neighbor-joining trees were
generated with MEGA4 using the pair-wise deletion
option and 5000 bootstraps [92]. Tree topologies were
confirmed using Bayesian inference (MrBayes v.3.1.2)
[93,94] with four independent chains run for at least
1,000,000 generations until sufficient trees were sampled
to generate > 99% credibility. LTR trees were generated
using Bayesian inference as above.
Age estimation of HML-2 proviruses and subgroups

Individual provirus ages were inferred using a neutral
substitution rate of 0.24%-0.45% per million years, as
previously described by Hughes and Coffin [65]. Briefly,
nucleotide substitutions between cognate 5’ and 3’ LTRs
were counted and scored as a percentage of their
sequence length, with insertions or deletions of > 2
bases treated as single substitutions. The substitution
frequency was divided by 0.24%/mya (for upper bound)
or 0.45%/mya (for lower bound) per provirus to obtain
age estimates. To estimate the relative ages of solo
LTRs, they were first divided into groups based upon
shared nucleotide motifs: LTR5A, LTR5B, LTR5Hs. The
LTR5Hs share a 4 base insertion at the consensus position 461; LTR5A-specific insertions are found at position 135 of the LTR5A consensus; LTR5B LTRs are
missing both insertions. For each group, an alignment
was made using ClustalW, manually edited and used to
generate group consensus sequences. Ages were

Page 19 of 22

estimated per group by comparing the number of substitutions between individual elements with the respective consensus sequence per LTR subgroup using the
average age calculated using by the Jukes-Cantor model
[68] and the Kimura 2-parameter model with  = 2
[68]. Ages were adjusted by drawing a best-fit line using
PRISM between proviral age as determined by 5’ and 3’
LTR comparison, and the age determined using the distance from subgroup consensus. The slope of the line
going through the origin was used as an age correction
factor, with slopes of lines corresponding to 95% confidence intervals being used to calculate the maximum
and minimum ages. Note that since much of the divergence between LTRs at different integration sites may
have occurred during virus replication prior to germline
integration, ages estimated in this way are likely to be
quite inaccurate.
Statistical analyses

All statistical analyses were performed by the Data
Design and Resource Center at Tufts University. Briefly,
we analyzed the pair-wise relationship between proviruses, solo LTRs, RefSeq genes, and chromosome size.
Values for total proviruses and solo LTRs were from the
HML-2 dataset presented in this study, and values for
chromosomal size and gene density were extracted
respectively using the Base Position and RefSeq Genes
tracks within UCSC Genome Browser. Expected frequencies for proviruses, solo LTRs, and RefSeq genes
were estimated as a function of chromosome number
using negative binomial regression analysis. In each
model, likelihood ratio (LR) statistics were calculated: -2
(log likelihood (from the model without a predictor) log likelihood (from the model with a predictor)) and
subsequently analyzed by a c2 test with degrees of freedom equal to 1. All results had a p-value < 0.01.
