Introduction
HTLV-1 is endemic in the Northwest among Kolla
natives while Buenos Aires city (BA) is considered as
non-endemic. In the last decades, migrations to BA have
changed from Europeans to Latin-Americans from
countries with endemic focus for HTLV-1 infection
(Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru, Brazil, and Chile) and also from
different African countries.
Objective
To determine the phylogeographic origin of HTLV-1
strains and the ethnic background of HTLV-1 positive
residents of Buenos Aires.
Materials and methods
63 HTLV-1 positive BA residents were retrospectively
studied. Phylogeny of LTR region was performed by
PAUP 4.0 and tree topology was visualized by TreeView.
The ethnic origin of individuals was inferred by the
study of mitochondrial DNA haplogroups (complete
control region).
Results
All LTR sequences were classified as Cosmopolitan subtype/Transcontinental subgroup. Twenty-five of them,
belonging to individuals of Amerindian and 3 of African
ancestry, were included in the Big Latin American cluster with HTLV-1 references from Amerindians. On the
other hand, 9 LTR sequences belonging to individuals of
Amerindian ancestry, grouped with references from people of black ethnic component of Africa, French Guiana

and Suriname (Small Latin American and South African
clusters).

Conclusions
This study confirms the presence HTLV-1 cosmopolitan
subtype/ Transcontinental subgroup in BA residents and
shows HTLV-1 strains from individuals of Amerindian
ancestry closely related to references from Africa and
Latin-American countries with an important afro-amerindian ethnic component. Finally, these results highlight
the importance of ethnic origin of HTLV-1infected people and the retroviral phylogeny to understand the influence of migration waves in the dynamics of the infection
in a specific geographic area.
