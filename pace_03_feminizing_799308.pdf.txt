Abstract

Dimorphic sexes are the norm in animals, although there are
rotifer species that consist solely of parthenogenetic females
[1], corals that produce long-lived clones that reproduce by
fragmentation [2], and some lizards and fish that spin-off
parthenogenetic lines that survive for multiple generations
[3]. Among the vast number of animal species that

reproduce with males and females, sexual differentiation is
controlled either chromosomally or environmentally. Flies
and worms are among the invertebrates that determine sex
by doses of X-chromosomal information. Within the vertebrates, there are several mechanisms that account for sexually dimorphic development. Because temperature controls
sexual development in crocodiles, many turtles and some

interactions

Conclusions: Molecular modeling suggests that Asw and Hint can heterodimerize and that
Gln127, an Asw-specific alteration for Trp123, dominantly interferes with the Hint active site. An
extra dose of HINT in ZZW chicks, and thus more Hint homodimer, may partially overcome the
feminizing influence of ASW and lead to the observed intersexual characteristics of ZZW triploids.

refereed research

Results: We consider whether positive cooperativity could explain how Hint heterodimerization
with an inert enzyme might reduce specific activity by more than 50% and provide data sufficient
to reject this model. Instead, we hypothesize that Asw carries a signal for mislocalization and/or
proteolysis, and/or dominantly suppresses the remaining Hint active site to function as a
dominant negative.

deposited research

Background: In birds and some lizards, females are heterogametic with a ZW karyotype, while
males are ZZ homogametes. The molecular basis for sexual differentiation in birds is unknown:
arguments exist for doses of Z masculinizing chicks and for W information feminizing. ASW was
identified as a tandemly repeated gene conserved on avian W chromosomes that is expressed in
early female development and appears to be an inactive form of avian Z-encoded HINT. Hint is a
dimeric enzyme that hydrolyzes AMP linked to lysine, whose enzyme activity is required for
regulation of the Cdk7 homologous Kin28 kinase in yeast. Of 16 residues most conserved across
all life forms for AMP interactions, 15 are sexually dimorphic in birds, that is, altered in the
female-specific Asw protein. Genomic and expression data suggest that Asw may feminize chicks,
dominantly interfering with Hint function by heterodimerization.

lizards, environmental sex determination (ESD) has been
proposed to be the primordial vertebrate mechanism for
sexual differentiation [4]. Some reptiles and most birds and
mammals have chromosomal sex determination (CSD)
systems and these systems involve remarkably different
chromosomes and genes [4]. CSD strategies, then, may have
evolved to program genetically the developmental routines
that occur in response to temperature in the vertebrates that
use ESD. The natural history of vertebrates suggests that
there were multiple solutions to the problem of CSD.
Nearly all mammals have the XX female and XY male
system, with XXY individuals being male and X0 individuals
female. These observations led to a search for the testisdetermining factor on the Y chromosome culminating in isolation of the SRY gene [5], which is sex-determining in
humans [6,7] and mice [8]. Beyond SRY, there are several
autosomal genes including the SRY-related SOX9 gene
[9,10], MIS [11,12], SF1 [13], WT1 [14] and DMRT1 [15] that
contribute to sexual organ formation, alterations of which
can cause male-to-female sex reversal in XY males. Because
there are rodent species with no SRY gene and no Y chromosome [16], any of these genes or the X-linked DAX1 gene [17]
might be considered candidates for a sex-determining gene
in the XX rodents such as mole voles whose body plan is not
so different from that of mice.
In birds, males are the homogametic sex, with two Z chromosomes, and females the heterogametic sex, with one Z and
one W chromosome. Z and W are not related to mammalian
X or Y chromosomes and, furthermore, it is not known if the
W chromosome confers femininity and/or if doses of the Z
chromosome confer masculinity [18]. In mammals and invertebrates, diploid animals of genotype X0 and XXY were
crucial in establishing that doses of X confer femininity in
invertebrates and that presence of Y confers masculinity in
mammals. Diploid birds with one or three sex chromosomes
were last reported 70 years ago [19], but triploid birds with
ZZZ and ZZW karyotypes have been observed. While ZZZ
triploids seemed like normal males that produced abnormal
sperm, ZZW animals appeared female on hatching and then
developed some male gonadal and behavioral characteristics
as they matured [20]. These studies suggest that the dosage
versus determining factor argument is a false dichotomy in
birds: doses of Z chromosome appear to masculinize while
presence of the W appears to feminize.
According to theory, a pair of autosomes can evolve into sex
chromosomes by mutation of a control gene [4]. If a control
gene confers sexual development by dosage, it might become
lost from the alternative sex chromosome. DMRT1 is a candidate dosage-dependent gene for masculinity in birds and alligators on the basis of Z-linkage [21], conservation, and
gene-expression patterns [22]. Alternatively, if a control gene
confers sexual development as a dominant determining factor,
it may have evolved as an allele of a gene on the opposite sex

chromosome. This latter mechanism is thought to relate SRY
to the X-linked SOX3 gene in mammals [23].
Histidine triad (HIT) enzymes are a superfamily of
nucleotide hydrolases and transferases that contain a catalytic motif related to the sequence His␾His␾His␾␾ (where
␾ represents a hydrophobic amino acid) and act on substrates containing a nucleoside monophosphate [24]. Branch
1 of the HIT superfamily includes the ubiquitous Hint
enzymes [25] plus two enzymes with a more phylogenetically
resstricted distribution, namely Aprataxin, which is lost in
humans with ataxia-oculomotor apraxia [26,27] and the
scavenger mRNA decapping enzyme Dcps [28,29]. While
Dcps enzymes are specific for hydrolysis of cap structures
such as 7meGpppG [28,29], prototypical Hint enzymes such
as rabbit Hint and yeast Hnt1 hydrolyze adenosine
5؅-monophosphoramide substrates such as AMP-lysine to
AMP plus lysine [30]. Loss of this enzymatic activity renders
yeast cells temperature-sensitive for growth on galactose
medium and hypersensitive to mild mutations in the yeast
homolog of mammalian Cdk7, that is, Kin28, the kinase
component of general transcription factor TFIIH [30]. Loss
of Hnt1 enzymatic activity also renders cells hypersensitive
to mutations in the cyclin H homolog Ccl1, the MAT1
homolog Tfb3, and to Cak1, the activating kinase for Kin28,
all of which lead to destabilized Kin28 complexes and a
likely increase in concentration of Kin28 monomers [30].
Consequently, it was suggested that a Kin28 monomer is the
likely target of Hint regulation, potentially because it is posttranslationally adenylylated and is a protein substrate of the
lysine-deadenylylating activity of Hint [24]. Indeed, twodimensional electrophoretic analysis of Kin28 is consistent
with Kin28 being subject to a post-translational modification in addition to phosphorylation [31,32] that appears to
be controlled by HNT1 genotype (A. Krakowiak and C.B.,
unpublished results). Finally, it is important to note that
Hint is a dimer with two identical purine nucleosidemonophosphate-binding sites per dimer [25]. The aminoacid residues that have remained most constant throughout
evolution are those that form the dimer interface and make
direct contact with AMP [25].
Chickens and many other orders of birds are dimorphic for
HINT-related genes on their sex chromosomes. The chicken
Z chromosome contains the locus for a typical HINT gene,
predicted to encode a polypeptide 83% identical to rabbit
Hint [33]. However, on the gene-poor, female-specific W
chromosome, the ASW (avian sex-specific W-linked) gene
was identified [33,34], encoding a predicted Asw protein
with striking similarity to Hint with the specific exception of
residues involved in AMP recognition. As shown in Figure 1,
the degree to which the nucleotide-binding site was altered
is remarkable. Although human biochemists can depress
activity more than 105-fold in Fhit [35,36] and Hint [30]
with a single active-site His mutation, hens apparently
continued to peck at the sequence of Hint, altering all four of

Results and discussion

One might expect a Hint-Asw heterodimer to have substantially less than 50% of the activity of a Hint homodimer if
Hint homodimers showed cooperativity with respect to substrate binding and/or hydrolysis. For example, if the first
nucleotide substrate were to bind weakly but the presence of
the first bound substrate promoted efficient binding of a
second substrate, then a heterodimer containing one functional and one nonfunctional active site would retain only
one low-affinity binding site and be severely defective. This
mechanism can be largely excluded, however, because sigmoidal substrate saturation kinetics were not observed with
AMP-NH2 [30]. The data for both rabbit and yeast Hint
enzymes indicate that the dimer’s two crystallographically
defined nucleotide-binding sites [25] bind nucleotide independently and fit well to a single submicromolar Km for each
enzyme (Figure 2) [30].

deposited research

ASW is absent in the ratites, emu and ostrich [34], which
have indistinguishable sex chromosomes, but is tandemly
repeated approximately 40 times on the W chromosome of all
the non-ratite birds examined [33]. Confirming the subtractive manner in which ASW was cloned, both groups found
that ASW mRNA is highly expressed in the female urogenital
ridge at the stages preceding and during sexual differentiation [33,34]. Additionally, HINT mRNA is expressed at levels
about two-fold greater in males than in females, in developing chicks more than in adult chickens, and at a message level
one-seventh to one-tenth the level of ASW in stage-29
females [33]. ASW was cloned a third time as a message that
is increased in cells lacking the splicing factor ASF/SF2 [37].
Surprisingly, ASF/SF2 did not affect splicing of the ASW
message but rather destabilized the mRNA [37]. Involvement
of ASF/SF2 in the regulation of ASW mRNA is interesting
because sex-specific splicing of doublesex mRNA in
Drosophila, a sex-determining gene for which the mammalian DMRT genes were named, is mediated in part by
ASF/SF2 [38]. Although the initial cloning of ASW pre-dated
knowledge that Hint is an enzyme, both groups suggested
that Asw might function by a dominant-negative mechanism
through heterodimerization with Hint, thereby inducing
female development [33,34]. Heterodimerization was also
discussed in the review literature [18], also without awareness that Hint function depends on enzymatic activity [30].

sites that is produced as a heterodimer with one good and
one bad active site would be expected to have 50% of the
specific activity of the homodimer. This is not a scenario for
dominant negativity and, in fact, such a scenario does not
explain why Asw is produced at all. If Asw were simply an
inert dimerization partner for Hint, a 50% reduction in Hint
cellular specific activity could be obtained if there were no
ASW genes on the W chromosome. Males would have two
doses of HINT and females one dose, such that twice as
much Hint dimer could be made in males as in females. Furthermore, if ASW were simply a loss-of-function allele, given
the paucity of genes on the W chromosome, sex-chromosome theory [4] suggests that such a gene would be lost. The
repeated and highly expressed nature of the gene suggests
that it has evolved to be dominantly interfering - the challenge is to determine the mechanism of dominance over the
Z-encoded HINT.

heterodimerization, Asw must carry a signal for mislocalization
and/or proteolysis, and/or somehow alter the Hint active
site. We therefore constructed a molecular model of the
proposed Hint-Asw heterodimer by superimposing the
chicken Hint sequence on the determined X-ray structure of
rabbit Hint, and threading and minimizing the Asw
sequence on the opposing monomer. This analysis suggested: first, that Hint and Asw do retain sufficient
sequence identity at the dimer interface to form a heterodimer; second, that Asw has an insertion sequence at the
bottom of the dimer that could be a site of alternative localization or proteolysis; and third, that Gln127, a residue that
Asw has substituted for Trp123 of Hint, may interfere with
the function of His114 in Hint across the dimer interface.
Although altered specificity of a putative Hint-Asw heterodimer is conceivable, the simplest enzymatic mechanism for
dominant interference is that Gln127 from Asw depresses
activity from the Hint active site.
The dimer interface of Hint is formed by antiparallel interactions between helix ␣2 and its symmetry mate and strand ␤4
and its symmetry mate [25]. These sequences are contiguous
in the primary sequence of Hint and form the region of

putative Hint-Asw heterodimer, and whether Gln127 is
required for depression of Hint enzymatic activity in HintAsw heterodimers. Turning to genetic analysis, if ASW has a
significant role in feminization of birds, then viruses that
increase expression of Asw may promote female development
in ZZ eggs, potentially in a manner that requires Gln127. If
HINT is part of the Z chromosome that works by gene
dosage, then viruses that direct expression of Hint may
promote male or intersexual development in ZW eggs as was
seen with ZZW triploids [20]. Finally, if it is true that Hint
enzyme activity is important in making ZZ chicks male or if
Hint inhibition is important in making ZW chicks female,
then it will be interesting to learn whether Hint is involved in
establishment or maintenance of sex in other animals.

Identification of sex-linked ASW and HINT genes in birds
has raised new experimental questions. It will be interesting
to learn whether Asw and Hint heteromultimerize and what
the in vitro and in vivo stabilities of heterooligomers are with
respect to the homodimers. It will be interesting to determine
whether Asw homodimers display any binding to Hint substrates, what degree of Hint enzyme activity is retained by the

reviews

The crystal structure of nucleotide-bound forms of rabbit
Hint showed that the carboxy-terminal amino acids of each
Hint monomer extend across the dimer interface and are
buried near the opposing nucleotide. The Trp residue in the
extreme carboxy-terminal Trp-Pro-Pro-Gly motif is buried
near His114, the final His of the HIT motif, of the opposing
monomer [25]. His114 corresponds to His98 of Fhit, which
was localized in low barrier hydrogen-bonding distance to
the ␣-␤ bridging oxygen of a bound ApppA analog in cocrystal structure with Fhit His96Asn [35]. On the basis of
mutagenesis of the conserved His residues in Fhit [39] and
the location of these His residues in crystal structures of
Hint and Fhit [25,35], a catalytic role was proposed for
His114 [24]. The structures show that His51 is in the same
plane as His114, with the ⑀N of His 51 positioned to accept a
hydrogen bond from the ␦N of His114. This geometry was
considered critical for the enzymatic activity of Hint and
Fhit. As shown in Figure 1, Asw sequences contain a substitution of Gln127 for Trp123 of Hint. As shown in Figure 3,
Gln127 of Asw is predicted to alter the conformation of Hint
His114 such that His114 is not positioned for productive
hydrogen bonding, dominantly depressing hydrolase activity
from the Hint active site. In short, loss of the AMP-binding
site is predicted to account for negativity of Asw. Gln127 and
possibly insertion sequences that may have a role in stability
or localization are predicted to make Asw dominant.

greatest identity with Asw (Figure 1). Apart from the curious
substitution of 15 of 16 nucleotide-proximal residues in Asw,
the most dissimilar region of Asw consists of a five aminoacid insertion between strands ␤1 and ␤2 and substitution of
Gly-Ala-Pro (Asw) for Asp-Glu-Ser (Hint) at the amino-terminal end of helix ␣2. Both these changes are located on the
bottom surface of the dimer [25]. The bulky amino acids in
the Asw insertion (Pro-Leu-Trp-Thr-Arg), which in Hint is
an extremely tight ␤ turn, may be a handle for altered localization or proteolysis. Cellular localization of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions to Hint and Asw was investigated
in male chick embryo fibroblasts [33]. GFP-Hint was found
to be distributed in the cytoplasm and the nuclei, though
somewhat concentrated in the nuclei with respect to the GFP
control [33]. GFP-Asw was found to be essentially confined
to nuclei [33]. Though localization of Hint in Asw-overexpressing cells was not examined, if Hint has extranuclear
(that is, Cdk7-exclusive) functions, then excluding Hint from
the cytoplasm may be an important function of Asw.
