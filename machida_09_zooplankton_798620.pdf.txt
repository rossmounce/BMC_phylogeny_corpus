Abstract
Background: Oceans cover more than 70% of the earth's surface and are critical for the
homeostasis of the environment. Among the components of the ocean ecosystem, zooplankton
play vital roles in energy and matter transfer through the system. Despite their importance,
understanding of zooplankton biodiversity is limited because of their fragile nature, small body size,
and the large number of species from various taxonomic phyla. Here we present the results of
single-gene zooplankton community analysis using a method that determines a large number of
mitochondrial COI gene sequences from a bulk zooplankton sample. This approach will enable us
to estimate the species richness of almost the entire zooplankton community.
Results: A sample was collected from a depth of 721 m to the surface in the western equatorial
Pacific off Pohnpei Island, Micronesia, with a plankton net equipped with a 2-m2 mouth opening. A
total of 1,336 mitochondrial COI gene sequences were determined from the cDNA library made
from the sample. From the determined sequences, the occurrence of 189 species of zooplankton
was estimated. BLASTN search results showed high degrees of similarity (>98%) between the
query and database for 10 species, including holozooplankton and merozooplankton.
Conclusion: In conjunction with the Census of Marine Zooplankton and Barcode of Life projects,
single-gene zooplankton community analysis will be a powerful tool for estimating the species
richness of zooplankton communities.

Background
The fauna of the world's oceans is dominated in terms of
abundance and biomass by drifting organisms collectively
referred to as plankton. Plankton occur in all marine
waters, throughout all depths, and, for many species,
across widespread biogeographical regions. Zooplankton
(planktonic animals) support many major fisheries and

mediate fluxes of nutrients and chemical elements essential to life on earth. Despite more than a century of sampling the oceans, a comprehensive understanding of
zooplankton biodiversity has eluded oceanographers
because of the fragile nature and small body size of these
organisms, as well as the large number of species from various taxonomic phyla [1,2]. For many zooplankton

groups, there are longstanding and unresolved questions
of species identification, systematic relationships, genetic
diversity, and biogeography. In light of this, we are working toward a taxonomically comprehensive assessment of
zooplankton biodiversity throughout the world's oceans
through the international project Census of Marine Zooplankton [3].

Results and Discussion
A zooplankton sample was collected off Pohnpei Island,
Micronesia (6°16'N, 162°09'E). A cDNA mitochondrial
COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) gene library was constructed from the sample, and 1,336 inserts containing
the mitochondrial COI gene were randomly sequenced
[DDBJ: AB332438-AB333773]. A cDNA rather than a
gDNA library was constructed to remove pseudogene
sequences from the analysis [4]. The mismatch distribution of these 1,336 sequences revealed a high frequency of
very small (<0.03) genetic distance sequence pairs (Figure
1). These sequence pairs with very small genetic distances
were assumed to have originated from the same species
(discussed below). A second peak was observed around a
distance of about 0.14 (from 0.13 to 0.16), and most of
these counts were comparisons between two phylogroups
in the Copepoda clade (Figure 2, Clades 1 and 2). The frequencies between these peaks were very low. The minimum frequency (106 counts) was observed in the range
between 0.12 and 0.13. Based on this observation, we set
the criterion that if the genetic distance of two sequences
was greater than 0.12, the sequences were derived from
different species. If the genetic distance of two sequences
was less than 0.12, then we considered the sequences to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/438

be derived from the same species. The genetic distances of
the mitochondrial COI gene sequence have been reported
from various animal taxa (mainly Vertebrata and Arthropoda), and the general ranges for the intra- and interspecies distances are 0.0001-0.05 and 0.04-0.21, respectively
(Kimura two-parameter model) [5]. Although it is not a
conclusive value for animal species definition, we have
tentatively taken a genetic distance of 0.12 as the boundary between intra- and interspecies distances in this study,
and this value was in the range of interspecific genetic distance reported previously [5]. The rarefaction curve was
estimated using the criterion of a genetic distance of 0.12
(Figure 3) using DOTUR [6]. Although the number of
observed OTUs is still growing in 1,300 sequenced colonies, the rate of increase of the curve decreased gradually
after around 100 sequenced colonies. Figure 4 shows the
relationships between species richness estimated by
Chao1, rarefaction, and percentage of sequence differences used for the estimation. The figure shows gradual
changes of Chao1 and rarefaction around sequence differences of 0.12. As the distance of 0.12 is not a conclusive
value for species definition, caution is required in the further use of this value.
We conducted BLASTN searches against the GenBank
non-redundant database using as queries all sequences
derived from the analysis. Among the sequences, those
that fulfilled the criteria (BLAST score and similarity
greater than 100 and 83%, respectively) were assigned to
11 taxonomic groups (Figure 2). Several of the assigned
sequences showed very high degrees of nucleotide similarity to known species, including Copepoda (Candacia

Among them, one vertebrate species, Coryphaena hippurus, and two benthic gastropod species, Strombus mutabilis and Strombus wilsoni, were sampled as nonholozooplanktonic animals in the dispersal life history
phase as pelagic larvae. These observations indicated that
application of this analysis enables the estimation of larval dispersal, which is difficult to achieve based on morphological observations.

nomic group formed a single cluster including Gastropoda, Chaetognatha, Euphausiacea, Decapoda, Vertebrata,
Copepoda, and Cephalopoda. There were also two cases
in which the taxonomic assignment did not work well.
The first was the occurrence of Hexapoda in various clusters, which rarely occurs in the ocean environment, except
pleustonic insects of the genus Halobates. The second was
the difficulty of assignment of taxonomic groups due to
low BLAST scores and similarities (coloured grey in Figure
2). The most plausible reason for these ambiguities is the
paucity of mitochondrial COI sequences for some taxa in
the DNA database. In general, the mitochondrial COI
gene sequences in the DNA database are biased among
taxa, and this bias was assumed to be the main reason for
the occurrence of Hexapoda in our analysis. The most efficient solution for these problems will be the expansion of
zooplankton DNA barcode, and it is hoped that the
progress of the Barcode of Life project [7] in collaboration
with the Census of Marine Zooplankton will fill these
gaps.
To our knowledge, the Discovery SOND cruise [8] is the
only other attempt to date to estimate the species richness
of a whole zooplankton community collected at a single
site. In this series of studies [9-19], a total of 618 species
of zooplankton were identified and counted in samples
collected around the Canary Islands (Table 2). The extrapolated species richness (Chao1 [20]) of the present study
was estimated as 188.90 (95% confidence interval,
156.79-255.60) using DOTUR [6]. Our results cannot be
directly compared with the SOND cruise data because of
differences in sampling effort between the two studies. In
the SOND cruise, two primary types of sampling equipment were used: Isaacs-Kidd midwater trawl and N113H.
Furthermore, about 76 vertically stratified zooplankton
samples that were collected above 1,000 m were combined to estimate the occurrence of species [19]. In contrast, the present study was conducted based on a single
sample collected from a depth of 721 m to the surface.
These sampling effort differences may have accounted for
the differences in species richness between the SOND
cruise and the present study. In addition, the lower species
richness in the present study may have been due to our
experimental design. In the present study, after construction of the cDNA library from mRNA, the mitochondrial
COI genes were amplified with "universal (LCO1490
[21])" and polyT primers. It is possible that some of the
mitochondrial COI gene sequences may not have been
amplified due to primer mismatch for some species.
Although the single-gene zooplankton community analysis approach is an efficient means of collecting sequence
information, given technical difficulties due to primer
mismatch, further studies and the development of novel

tion [23,24]. We are currently expanding our sampling
effort to all oceans to further understand zooplankton
biodiversity.

Conclusion
Although the estimation of species richness and composition of the community are among the most important
aspects of single-gene zooplankton community analysis,
these sequence data will be further utilised by construction of a dedicated database. We expect that the accumulation of additional marine animal mitochondrial COI
gene sequence data in the barcode project will aid in further clarifying sequences from unknown species. Furthermore, this process of sequence assignment to particular
species through database analysis indicated the occurrence of these species in the sampling site for the present
study. We have now constructed a publicly accessible zooplankton community analysis database that can be
searched using BLASTN [22].

Zooplankton sampling
The sample was collected off Pohnpei Island, Micronesia
(6°16'N, 162°09'E). Collection was performed with a
plankton net (ORI net [25]) with a 2-m2 mouth opening
and 0.69-mm mesh aperture. After removal of large animals (more than about 4 cm at their largest measurement), the sample was split into two fractions: one was
preserved in ethanol for barcode analysis and the other
was homogenised with TRIZol (Invitrogen) and kept at 80°C. A total wet volume of about 30 mL zooplankton
was collected and homogenised with 270 mL TRIZol in
this step.

With regard to the future of zooplankton community
genetic analysis, adoption of next-generation sequencing
technology should enable researchers to read libraries sufficiently to estimate species richness without extrapola-

Total RNA extraction and mRNA purification
In the laboratory, total RNA was extracted from the sample following the TRIZol protocol, followed by mRNA
purification using Poly(A)Purist MAG (Ambion). A total
of 9.6 mL total RNA (aqueous phase) was further purified
for mRNA in this step.

Methods

Mitochondrial COI gene library construction and sequence
analysis
The purified mRNA was used as the template for Creator
SMART cDNA Library Construction Kit (BD Biosciences).
Using this constructed cDNA library, we amplified mitochondrial COI genes using COI universal (LCO1490) [21]
and polyT primers with restriction sites that were further
used to construct a mitochondrial COI gene library with
the same kit. We then randomly analysed colonies
obtained on agar plates.
BLASTN search and taxonomic assignment
The lengths of all obtained sequences were adjusted to
500 base pairs, and a BLASTN [26] search against the
Page 5 of 7

NCBI non-redundant dataset with default settings was
performed with all sequences as queries. Those sequences
that did not show any similarity to the mitochondrial COI
gene sequences were removed (the search was performed
in November 2006). BLASTN search against the NCBI
non-redundant dataset was also used to infer species or
higher taxonomic groups of mitochondrial COI gene
sequences determined in the present study. In the BLASTN
result list, the species with the highest score was assigned
to each sequence with the following criteria. If the
BLASTN score was 100 or more and BLASTN similarity
was 98% or more, the name of the resulted species was
assigned to the sequence and listed in table 1. If the
BLASTN score was 100 or more and BLASTN similarity
was 83-98%, the name of higher taxon group to which the
resulted species belongs was assigned to the sequence and
is shown in the figure 2. If BLASTN scores and similarity
values did not reach these values of criteria, 'unknown'
was assigned to the sequences and are colored gray in the
figure 2.
Removal of PCR recombination, mismatch distribution
analysis, rarefaction curve analysis, phylogenetic analysis
To remove sequences produced by PCR recombination,
we manually applied a partial treeing approach [27] to the
aligned dataset; although some programs and servers are
available for related analysis, none worked appropriately
for our analysis. Briefly, after the sequence alignment was
adjusted using ClustalX [28], square distance matrixes of
both the left 100 and right 100 base pairs of the aligned
sequence were constructed in MEGA3.1 [29]. Then total
absolute deviations of each sequence in these matrixes
were calculated. As a result, we deleted one sequence that
showed a very large deviation from the others. We
assumed this was not the only chimera sequence that
occurred in the analysis, but it was not possible to eliminate all PCR recombination sequences because of ambiguity. After removing the PCR recombination sequences
from the analysis, we again adjusted alignment of the
remaining 1,336 sequences using ClustalX. An unrooted
phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbourjoining method with nucleotide p-distances (alignment
gaps were completely deleted) implemented in
PAUP*4.10b [30]. The reliability of each tree node was
assessed using the bootstrap method with 1,000 replicates. The mismatch distribution was estimated from the
distance matrix. The distance matrix was also calculated
using PHYLIP3.66 [31], and the matrix was further used
for rarefaction curve and Chao1 calculation using DOTUR
[6].
