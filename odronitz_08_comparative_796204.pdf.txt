Abstract
Background: Alternative splicing of mutually exclusive exons is an important mechanism for
increasing protein diversity in eukaryotes. The insect Mhc (myosin heavy chain) gene produces all
different muscle myosins as a result of alternative splicing in contrast to most other organisms of
the Metazoa lineage, that have a family of muscle genes with each gene coding for a protein
specialized for a functional niche.
Results: The muscle myosin heavy chain genes of 22 species of the Arthropoda ranging from the
waterflea to wasp and Drosophila have been annotated. The analysis of the gene structures allowed
the reconstruction of an ancient muscle myosin heavy chain gene and showed that during evolution
of the arthropods introns have mainly been lost in these genes although intron gain might have
happened in a few cases. Surprisingly, the genome of Aedes aegypti contains another and that of
Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus two further muscle myosin heavy chain genes, called Mhc3 and Mhc4,
that contain only one variant of the corresponding alternative exons of the Mhc1 gene. Mhc3
transcription in Aedes aegypti is documented by EST data. Mhc3 and Mhc4 inserted in the Aedes and
Culex genomes either by gene duplication followed by the loss of all but one variant of the
alternative exons, or by incorporation of a transcript of which all other variants have been spliced
out retaining the exon-intron structure. The second and more likely possibility represents a new
type of a 'partially' processed pseudogene.
Conclusion: Based on the comparative genomic analysis of the alternatively spliced arthropod
muscle myosin heavy chain genes we propose that the splicing process operates sequentially on the
transcript. The process consists of the splicing of the mutually exclusive exons until one exon out
of the cluster remains while retaining surrounding intronic sequence. In a second step splicing of
introns takes place. A related mechanism could be responsible for the splicing of other genes
containing mutually exclusive exons.

Background
Alternative splicing is an important and widespread
mechanism that is used by higher organisms to express
molecularly distinct mRNAs in response to developmental and cellular contexts [1,2]. Mutually exclusive splicing,
in which only one exon is chosen out of a cluster of alternative exons arranged in a tandem array, is a very frequent
alternative splicing event on a genome-wide level [3,4].
Several mechanisms have been proposed that explain why
only one of the two or more variants is included in the
mature mRNA [5-7]. Mostly, Metazoa contain mutually
exclusive exons only in pairs. Extreme cases for mutually
exclusive splicing are the insects Dscam genes that have
arrays of up to 52 variants as observed in the Drosophila
Dscam gene [8]. A less dramatic example is the mutually
exclusive spliced Drosophila muscle myosin heavy chain
gene that can potentially produce 480 different mRNAs
[9].
Myosins comprise a large superfamily of actin-based
motors that fulfill a variety of cellular functions from cell
division, cellular locomotion, and vesicle transport to
muscle contraction [10,11]. 35 classes of myosins have
been identified to date with each class being responsible
for a different function [12-14]. The first myosin was identified in skeletal muscle tissue over hundred years ago (for
a review about the history of muscle myosin see [15]) and,
since different myosins turned up, it has been referred to
as conventional myosin or class-II myosin. Class-II
myosins comprise the largest and most extensively studied class not only because the muscle myosin genes and
muscles have been in the focus of biophysical and biochemical studies for decades and because the metazoan
species are the most studied organisms but also because
this class contains the most isoforms per organism [12].
Drosophila melanogaster contains two class-II myosin
genes, one encoding the muscle isoforms (Mhc) and one
the nonmuscle isoform (zipper) [16]. The Mhc gene produces all different muscle myosins as a result of alternative
RNA splicing [9]. This is in contrast to the organisms of
most other taxa of the Metazoa lineage, that have a family
of muscle myosin heavy chain genes with each gene coding for a protein specialized for a functional niche. For
example, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans expresses
six muscle myosins [13], while the ascidian Ciona intestinalis genome contains five muscle myosin heavy chain
genes [17] and vertebrate genomes encode up to 22 muscle myosin heavy chain isoforms [12].
The Drosophila Mhc gene consists of 30 exons including
five clusters of alternatively spliced exons and one differentially included penultimate exon. Thus, 480 combinations of alternative exons are possible. The four clusters of
alternative exons in the motor domain part of the gene

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/21

code for 120 different variations of the motor domain. In
contrast to the muscle myosins of the other metazoa species, changes modulating myosin function are thus limited to four regions in the head domain. These discrete
regions of sequence variation have been shown to produce physiological differences among the various muscle
types [18]. Although many variations are possible and all
alternative exons get expressed at some point in Drosophila's life, only a limited number of combinations seem
to be employed. For example, during Drosophila embryogenesis only seven Mhc transcripts have been found to be
expressed [18].
The genome of Drosophila melanogaster was the third
eukaryotic genome to be completely sequenced [19].
Since then, the number of sequenced organisms has
increased rapidly. Of the phylum Arthropoda, the
genomes of the mosquitos Anopheles gambiae [20] and
Aedes aegypti [21] and the silkworm Bombyx mori [22] have
been published, and 17 further insect genomes have been
finished of which eleven belong to the Drosophila species
group [23,24].
Originally, pseudogenes have been defined as DNA
sequences that are derived from functional genes, but
acquired such degenerative features as premature stop
codons and frameshift mutations, which make them unable to produce functional proteins [25-27]. Non-processed pseudogenes are thought to result from tandem
duplications of genes with subsequent accumulation of
disabling mutations. Processed pseudogenes lack introns
and their original upstream gene regulatory resions and
presumably arise by retrotransposition of a mature messenger RNA (mRNA). While non-processed pseudogenes
are commonly found near the functional original gene,
processed pseudogenes are randomly inserted into the
genome. Also, partially processed pseudogenes have been
reported that sometimes contain the complete coding
region [28,29]. Recent studies have shown, that pseudogenes are not just "Junk" DNA but often exhibit functional
roles (for a review see [26]).
Here, we report the comparative genomic analysis of the
muscle myosin heavy chain genes of all arthropod species
that have completely been sequenced so far. On this basis
we propose that the splicing process operates sequentially
on the transcript involving the splicing of all unwanted
alternative versions of an exon while retaining intronic
sequence around the remaining variant.

melanogaster protein as query (Figure 1, see Additional file
1). The species analysed were the mosquitos Aedes aegypti,
Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus and Anopheles gambiae, the
silkworm Bombyx mori, the honeybee Apis mellifera, the
jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis, the waterflea Daphnia pulex,
the rust-red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, the body
louse Pediculus humanus corporis, and thirteen Drosophila
species (Table 1). According to the general nomenclature
for myosin sequences [12] the alternatively spliced muscle
myosin heavy chain genes are named Mhc1, and the nonmuscle myosin heavy chain genes are denoted Mhc2. The
sequences were assigned by manual inspection of the
genomic DNA sequences. Exons have been confirmed by
the identification of flanking consensus intron-exon
splice junction donor and acceptor sequences (Figure 1)
[30]. Because of the five to nine clusters of mutually exclusive exons and the included or excluded penultimate
exon, automatic identification of all exons failed. The
genomic sequences of Apis mellifera and Bombyx mori contain several gaps that at least in one case must have contained missing exons. The expression of the myosin genes

including the transcription of some of the mutually exclusive exons has been confirmed by analysis of corresponding EST data.
The untranslated first exons of the genes have been
assigned by analysing EST data, if possible. Because
untranslated 5' exons were found for all those species for
which EST data covering the amino-termini of the genes is
available, it is expected that the other arthropod myosin
genes also contain untranslated first exons. Accordingly,
the unambiguously identified exons have been numbered
starting with exon two. Duplicated exons were named in
alphabetical order according to the direction of transcription, the exception being the alternatively spliced exon 11
of the Drosophila Mhc1 of which the first of the mutually
exclusive exons was named 11e for historical reasons [9].
The differentially included penultimate exons of the Drosophila species have been predicted based on their similarity at the DNA level. Although this exon mainly consists
of untranslated bases and its identity between the Drosophila species is almost as low as that found in intron
regions, the exon borders are conserved enough to be rec-

Diagram of the arthropod Mhc1 genes with exon-intron structure. The gene structures of the arthropod muscle
myosins genes are shown using the following color code: light-gray: intron sequences; dark-gray: common exons; colored:
alternatively spliced exons. The Drosophila melanogaster Mhc1 gene is shown as representative for all Drosophila sp. Mhc1 genes,
because their gene structures only differ in the length of the introns. The transcriptional and translational start sites, the stop
codons and polyadenylation sites are shown if they have been determined. Some genes are spread on several contigs. The corresponding gap positions are shown in black, if further exons are not expected, and in red, if exons are definitively missing. The
genes are drawn to scale except for the Aedes aegypti genes where the extremely long introns have been shortened. Gaps have

ognised. The carboxy-terminal exons of the other arthropod Mhc1 genes have been confirmed by analysing EST
data, if possible. For TicMhc1 and DapMhc1 only one carboxy-terminal exon could be confirmed by EST data.
However, given the exon conservation between all arthropod Mhc1 genes it is expected that both genes contain
another carboxy-terminal exon. For Nasonia, EST data is
not available. The carboxy-terminal exon of the NavMhc1
gene was identified based on its homology to the other

Mhc1 exons. An exon corresponding to the penultimate
exon of the other genes could not be identified.
The Drosophila sp. Mhc1 genes, the AeaMhc1 and the
CpqMhc1 gene contain consensus polyadenylation signals

and Tic contain polyadenylation signals of type AAAAAA.
For the DmMhc1 gene it has been shown that the use of
either polyadenylation site is not regulated [31,32] and

the same might be true for the two or multiple polyadenylation sites of the other arthropod genes.
Identification of further muscle myosin heavy chain genes
in Aedes aegypti and Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus
Surprisingly, a second muscle myosin heavy chain gene
has been identified in Aedes aegypti (Figure 1) and named
Mhc3. The Mhc3 gene contains the same exon organisation as Mhc1 except that it does not have any cluster of
alternatively spliced exons and misses the two carboxy-terminal exons (Figure 1). Many EST clones provide supporting evidence for the deduced carboxy-terminus, the
amino-terminal untranslated exon1, and other parts of
the gene. The exons related to the alternatively spliced
exons of Mhc1 are either identical ("exon3b") or very similar to one of the Mhc1 exons. The protein sequence of
Mhc3 has an overall sequence identity of 91.4% to Mhc1.
Besides the different carboxy-termini, the largest differences are in loop-1, which is three residues shorter in
Mhc3, and in loop-2, which has only six instead of ten glycines and might therefore be structurally more restricted.
The Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus genome encodes
another two muscle myosin heavy chain genes that are
very similar to each other and have been named Mhc3 and
Mhc4 (Figure 1). Both have the same exon organisation as
the CpqMhc1 gene except that they do not have any cluster
of alternatively spliced exons and miss the two carboxyterminal exons. Another difference is that alternative
exons 8 are fused to the following constitutive exons in
the Mhc3 and Mhc4 genes. The protein sequence identity
between CpqMhc3 and CpqMhc4 is 92.0%, the identity to
CpqMhc1 is 84.4% and 90.4%, respectively. Surprisingly,
AeaMhc3, CpqMhc3 and CpqMhc4 retained identical variants of the alternatively spliced exons of the corresponding Mhc1 genes.
The BmMhc1, TicMhc1, PdcMhc1 and DapMhc1 genes
contain further clusters of alternatively spliced exons
The analysis of the BmMhc1, TicMhc1, PdcMhc1, and
DapMhc1 genes revealed further clusters of alternatively
spliced exons compared to the DmMhc1 gene. All further
sets of alternative exons encode for sequence that is part
of the motor domain. The additional alternative exon of
Bm, Pdc and Tic is conserved between these three organisms, and is also encoded within the Dap Mhc1 gene. It is
located between the alternatively spliced exons 11 and 17
(Bm), alternative exon 13 and constitutive exon 19 (Pdc),
and alternative exons 12 and 16 (Tic), respectively, and
separated from the neighbouring alternatively spliced
exons by constitutively expressed exons (Figure 1). In contrast to the other alternatively spliced exons, these alternatively spliced exons are different in length and amino acid
conservation (see Additional file 2, figure S6A). The first
part of the exon encodes part of loop-2 (see below), that
is a very flexible loop involved in actin-binding. In the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/21

arthropod genes it mainly consists of glycines, arginines,
and lysines. Thus, the alternatively spliced exons of Bm,
Tic, Pdc, and Dap encode different numbers and compositions of these residues. The second part of the alternatively
spliced exon is part of the following alpha-helix and hence
completely conserved in length and strongly conserved in
composition. In addition to this cluster of alternatively
spliced exons, the DapMhc1 gene contains three further
sets of alternatively spliced exons extending its number of
clusters of alternatively spliced exons to nine (compared
to five in Drosophila). Alternative exon 6 encodes an alternative P-loop to loop-1 sequence, alternative exon 11
directly follows the alternative exon encoding a structural
part near the ATP-binding site, and alternative exon 18
encodes an alternative version of the sequence after loop2 (Figure 1).
The PdcMhc1 gene encodes a strongly reduced set of
possible transcripts
The Pediculus humanus corporis Mhc1 gene contains the
most reduced set of alternative exons (Figure 1). It has
four sets of alternative exons each comprising two variants. However, the sequence encoding part of the converter domain, which is encoded by sets of three to five
alternative exons in the other arthropod genes, has been
fused to the following exon forming one constitutive exon
in the PdcMhc1 gene (exon 19, Figure 1). Also, the part in
the tail domain encoded by a set of two alternative exons
in all other arthropod genes is represented by only one
exon in the PdcMhc1 gene (exon 25). Altogether, the alternative exons encode for 16 different versions of the motor
domain and 32 different mRNAs of the PdcMhc1 gene,
compared to potentially 120 different combinations of
alternative exons for only the motor domain of the Drosophila Mhc1 gene.
Conservation of alternatively spliced exons
The number of variants differs between the arthropod species for many of the alternatively spliced exons (Figures 1
and 2). For the first set of alternatively spliced exons two
variants have been found in all Mhc1 genes. Both differ by
two absolutely conserved residues, namely the amino
acids alanine and aspartate at positions 25 and 26 in the
"a" variants of the exon that are substituted by serine and
asparagine in the "b" variants (Figure 3). A slightly less
conserved marker for the "b" variants is a cysteine at position 21. Variant 3a of the DapMhc1 is an exception as it
has an additional residue at the N-terminus compared to
the other Mhc1 variant "a" exons. The DapMhc1 gene
encodes three clusters of alternatively spliced exons not
found in the other arthropod Mhc1 genes. For all three
clusters exons variant "b" is more homologous to the corresponding amino acid sequences of the other Mhc1 proteins than variant "a" (see Additional file 2, figures S2, S4,
and S6B). The alternatively spliced exons of BmMhc1,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/21

DapMhc1, PdcMhc1 and TicMhc1 covering loop-2 are different in length and starting position (see Additional file
2, figure S6A). However, the "a" variants are more similar
to each other than to the "b" variants and the corresponding amino acid sequences of the other Mhc1 proteins.
Thus, the common ancestor of Bm, Dap, and Tic had in all
probability already contained an "a" and a "b" variant.
Completely conserved residues characterizing the "a" variant are a serine at the end of loop-2, a glutamate at position 3, and a leucine at position 8 of the following helix
([G/K/R 8-9]S [G/A]F [Q/M]TVS [S/A]LYR). Except for
PdcMhc1, all arthropod Mhc1 genes have two variants of
the mutually exclusively spliced exon in the tail (Figure 2;
see also Additional file 2, figure S8). The most conserved
differences between the two variants are an aspartate at
position 14 in variant "b" (either an asparagine or a
glutamine in variant "a") and an asparagine at position 24
(an arginine in variant "a"). In addition, at position 15 the
"b" variants have a large hydrophobic residue (leucine,
methionine, or phenylalanine) while the "a" variants
have a small polar residue (serine or threonine). In contrast to the other Mhc1 genes, the "a" variant of DapMhc1
is closer related to the "b" variants than to the other "a"
variants.

ants. The exon encoding a loop-helix motif adjacent to the
ATP-binding site (blue color in Figure 1) is not as conserved as the other alternatively spliced exons (Figure 2;
see also Additional file 2, figure S3). Therefore, it is difficult to identify characteristic residues/motifs for the
respective variants. Except for the PdcMhc1 and TicMhc1
genes all genes contain four variants. The variant with the
most characteristic residues is variant "c". It is characterized by a positively charged residue at position 8 (arginine
or histidine), a conserved arginine at position 21, and a
conserved asparagine at position 26. None of these residues appear in any of the other variants at the respective
positions. The TicMhc1, PdcMhc1, and DapMhc1 genes
have lost this variant. The only strong characteristic of variant "d" is a conserved isoleucine or valine at position 20
that is found in all Mhc1 genes. Variants "a" and "b" do
not contain any distinguishing residues.
The alternatively spliced exons spanning the relay helix
and the relay loop are the longest and most conserved of
the mutually exclusive exons (see Additional file 2, figure
S5). The variability ranges from two variants in the Pediculus Mhc1 gene to six variants in the Nasonia gene (Figures
1 and 2). The least conserved part of the exon is the relay
loop that is not embedded in the motor domain. In this
region, characteristic residues for certain variants are
found. Variant "c" is characterized by a conserved

Figure 2
Relationships between alternatively spliced exon
Relationships between alternatively spliced exon. Sections of the Mhc1 genes of Figure 1 have been aligned showing the
relationship between the exon-intron structures of the regions containing alternatively spliced exons. Continuous lines connect variants that are almost identical and thus expected to be derived from a common ancestor. Bold lines connecting alternative exons in regions containing multiple variants per Mhc1 gene highlight particularly conserved exons in these sets. Dotted
lines represent putative connections between certain variants although their identity is not very strong on the protein level.

Sequence conservation in the first set of the alternatively spliced exons
Sequence conservation in the first set of the alternatively spliced exons. On top, the protein sequence alignment of
the alternative exons is shown. The upper sequences, termed Mhc1, Mhc3, and Mhc4, respectively, represent the variant "a"
exons. Below, the comparison of the sequence identity between each exon and variant "a" and "b" of every other Mhc1 protein
is shown. The graphic has to be read in columns. The higher identity between an exon listed on top and variant "a" or "b" of a
certain Mhc1 protein listed on the left side has been set to 1 (red color) while the difference of the lower identity to the value
of the higher identity is plotted for the other combination of exons. Thus, in every column the higher identity of the named
exon to one of the variants of the other Mhc1 proteins is visualized.

glutamine at position 49 and either a glutamine or an
asparagine at position 50. A copy of this variant is present
in all Mhc1 genes except that of Tic. Another conserved
variant is variant "d" characterized by a glutamine at position 49 followed by a proline at position 50. This variant
appears in the Mhc1 genes of Aea, Ang, Cpq, Tic, and Bm.
Similar to the situation for the alternatively spliced exon
at the ATP-binding site, the other variants are not conserved enough to define characteristic residues. It is thus
not clear which were present in the ancient arthropod
gene and which arose through exon duplication in the
individual genes. Again, the DapMhc1 is the exception
because its first two variants, characterized by two conserved methionines at positions 42 and 55, differ from all
other variants.
The variants of the cluster of alternative exons encoding
part of the converter domain also show a high degree of
variability (Figure 2; see also Additional file 2, figure S7).
Two of the variants have characteristic features. Variant
"a" is the most conserved of the variants at the protein
level having a conserved methionine at position 9 and a
conserved cysteine at position 26. These residues do not
appear in any of the other variants of this cluster. Variant
"a" of this cluster is conserved in the Mhc1 genes of all species and therefore must have been present in their common ancestor. The last of the variants has a characteristic
feature at the DNA level. The intron following the last variant always has a GT 5' splice site. This is in contrast to all
other variants of this exon whose following introns have
a GC 5' splice site. At the amino acid level this variant is
characterized by a lysine at position 2, a cysteine at position 5 and a glutamate at position 20.
Wherever EST and/or cDNA data was available a differentially excluded penultimate exon could be identified.
These exons are very short (one to thirteen residues) and
not conserved (see Additional file 2, figure S9), and therefore similar exons have not been predicted for the species
for which EST data is not available. For Ang three carboxytermini have been identified. Based on EST data the
AngMhc1 transcript may also end with a short extension to
the antepenultimate exon. This C-terminus is similar to
that found for AeaMhc3 and CpqMhc4 and might be used
in a similar combination of the other alternatively spliced
exons.
Phylogenetic analysis of the arthropod muscle myosin
heavy chain genes
A phylogenetic tree of all arthropod Mhc1 protein
sequences, always incorporating the first variant of the
clusters of alternatively spliced exons and excluding the
differentially included penultimate exon, has been generated (Figure 4). In general, the tree reflects the phylogenetic relationship between the species. The AeaMhc3

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/21

sequence is most closely related to the CpqMhc3 and the
CpqMhc4 sequence implicating that the last common
ancestor of Aedes and Culex already had one of these
genes. The phylogeny of the Drosophila species slightly differs compared to other analyses [23]. Thus, the DaMhc1
sequence would have been expected to separate after the
divergence of the DpMhc1 sequence. Similarly, the
DseMhc1 gene would have been expected to be the closest
relative of the DssMhc1 sequence. Overall, the sequence
identity is very high. Between DapMhc1 and the other
sequences the identity is 70.6 – 77.9%, while it is between
77.0% and 99.7% between the other species.
Predicting the gene structure of an ancient Mhc1 gene
Whenever intron positions are shared between the genes,
the corresponding type of splice site is conserved, with the
exception of the shared exon 9 (AmMhc1), exon 10
(TicMhc1), exon 9 (BmMhc1), and the alternatively
spliced exon 11 of DapMhc1 (Figure 5). All introns have
consensus dinucleotide borders except those downstream
of the last variant of the cluster of alternative exons encoding part of the motor domain (homologs of exon 11 in
DmMhc1), which have a GC dinucleotide at the 5' donor
site instead of the consensus GT. The 3' exons of these
alternatively spliced exons again have a consensus GT site.
Exon '10a' of AeaMhc3 is almost identical to exon 10a of
AeaMhc1 and the following intron also has a GC dinucleotide at the 5' donor site. In contrast to the introns following the exons 9 of AmMhc1, NavMhc1, and BmMhc1, and
the intron following exon 10 of PdcMhc1 that have a consensus GT site, exon 10 of TicMhc1 has a GC 5' donor site.
The intron following exon 11a of DapMhc1 starts with a
consensus GT site, while the intron following exon 11b
starts with the absolutely rare GA dinucleotide. Also, all
split codons are shared between the genes.

In the part encoding the motor and the neck domain, all
intron positions are shared by at least two genes (Figure
5). In the coiled-coil tail domain, all genes have lost several introns so that the exons are considerably longer and
the intron positions in many cases are not identical.
Assuming, that introns have in most cases been lost and
were not gained during evolution [33], an ancient arthropod Mhc1 gene can be reconstructed (Figure 5). The
ancient Mhc1 gene is expected to contain all intron positions that appear in at least one of the analysed Mhc1
genes. In the motor domain, the proposed ancient Mhc1
gene structure completely resembles the DapMhc1 gene.
The exon lengths are between 30 and 210 bp. The exons
in the tail domain are considerably longer (up to 480 bp).
Structural implications of the alternatively spliced exons
The locations of the alternatively spliced exons of
DmMhc1 in the motor domain have been discussed in
detail elsewhere [34]. The position of the additional alter-

Phylogenetic tree of the arthropod muscle myosin heavy chain proteins
Phylogenetic tree of the arthropod muscle myosin heavy chain proteins. The amino acid sequences of the full-length
proteins were aligned manually. Because of their incompleteness the sequences of Drosophila persimilis and Drosophila yakuba
have been omitted from the tree calculation. Support values for each internal branch were obtained by 1,000 bootstrap steps.
The scale bar corresponds to 0.1 estimated amino acid substitutions per site.

natively spliced exons of the BmMhc1, TicMhc1, PdcMhc1,
and DapMhc1 genes in the structure of the motor domain
are shown in Figure 6. The alternative exons of DapMhc1
encoding the structural part from the P-loop to loop-1
have identical P-loop sequences. The loop-1 sequences are
identical in length but differ significantly in composition.
Studies have shown that the flexibility of this loop affects
the rate of ADP and phosphate release, with greater flexibility leading to an enhancement in the rate of product
release [35]. Although the amino acid composition is different between the alternative variants, both contain two
glycines and a similar overall charge. The alternative exons
of DapMhc1 including loop-4 are similar in length and
composition. This region of the motor domain has not

been investigated so far and therefore functional consequences of differences in the two variants cannot be
drawn. Loop-4 has been postulated to be important for
the proper localization of class-I myosins that contain
elongated loops that sterically interact with actin-binding
proteins [36] but the loop-4 sequences are almost identical between the two DapMhc1 variants and the two variants must therefore modulate a different property of the
motor domain. The loop-2 sequence is modulated by
alternative exons in the BmMhc1, DapMhc1, PdcMhc1, and
TicMhc1 genes. By studies of the Dictyostelium class-2
myosin with its loop-2 replaced with the analogous loop
from four other myosins with different enzymatic activities, loop-2 was shown to be involved in the weak and the

Diagram of the arthropod Mhc1 proteins. The exon-intron structure of the Mhc1 genes is shown based on the protein
sequence. Exons are shown as boxes while introns are represented by spaces. The same colour scheme has been used as in
Figure 1. Numbers on alternative exons denote the number of variants. The exons are drawn that the intron positions align
between the different Mhc1 genes. Thus, the exon lengths are not drawn to scale (e.g. the exons encoding the variable loop-2
are different in lengths). On the right side, the protein sequence of Drosophila melanogaster Mhc1 is shown as reference. Dotted
lines connect amino acids that are derived from split codons.

strong binding interactions with actin [37]. It also plays
an important role in the rate-limiting step of Pi release
[38,39]. The exon variants of the BmMhc1, DapMhc1,
PdcMhc1, and TicMhc1 genes encoding the loop-2
sequence have identical numbers of lysine and arginine
residues. The "a" variants are always one residue shorter
and have only four instead of five glycines. These differences are, however, very subtle and their influence on
actin binding is expected to be very small. The variants of
the alternative exon in DapMhc1 following loop-2 are very
similar. This part of the motor domain has also not been
investigated so far.

Discussion
25 muscle myosin heavy chain genes have been identified
in 22 species of the Arthropoda. All sequences share
strong homology to the alternatively spliced Mhc1 gene
that was first described in Drosophila melanogaster [9]. The
genes contain five to nine clusters of mutually exclusive
exons and an penultimate exon that might either be
included or excluded in the mRNA, and were assigned by
manual inspection of the genomic DNA sequences (Figure 1). Because of the many clusters of alternatively

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/21

spliced exons automatic identification of all exons failed.
This is probably also the main reason for the wrong prediction of the exon organisation of the Anopheles Mhc1
gene (supplementary material of [20]).
Altogether, alternative splicing of Mhc1 transcripts could
result in several hundred differently spliced mRNAs
(Table 1). The Pediculus Mhc1 gene has the least alternatives for its alternatively spliced exons resulting in a theoretical maximum of 32 different mRNAs, while the water
flea gene could result in at least 3072 different mRNAs.
Thus, except for Pediculus, Nasonia, and Apis mellifera all
arthropod Mhc1 genes, for which all exons could be identified, outscore the 480 mRNA possibilities of Drosophila
melanogaster. Although the number of possible transcripts
seems vast compared to the number of different muscle
myosin heavy chain genes in other metazoa species, the
regions to modulate the function of the protein are limited to five to nine. In Drosophila melanogaster, all alternative exons are expressed depending on the developmental
stage, but only a limited number of combinations seem to
be employed [18]. Whether all alternative exons are

expressed in the other arthropod species and which combinations are used has yet to be determined.

tant, though not the only, determinant for flight capabilities [41,42].

The phylogenetic analysis of the Mhc1 protein sequences
agrees with the expected phylogenetic relationship
between the species. There are two notable exceptions in
the Drosophila species section of the tree. The DseMhc1
sequence would have been expected to be the closest relative of the DssMhc1 sequence, and the DaMhc1 sequence
would have been expected to separate after the split of the
DpMhc1 and DrpMhc1 sequences. There are two possible
ways to explain this observation. Either, the Mhc1 genes
have evolved asynchronously as has been found for many
yeast genes [40] or the genes might have incorporated
back-mutations. The sequence identities of 96.1 to 99.7%
are very high, and thus only a few mutations would lead
to a different phylogenetic classification.

Based on the exon-intron patterns of the 21 Mhc1 genes
the gene structure of the ancient arthropod Mhc1 gene can
be predicted. The prediction is based on the assumption
that it is very unlikely that the different species, distributed over a broad taxonomic range, invented introns at
the same positions independently from each other. In the
first half of the genes encoding the motor and the neck
domain, all intron positions are shared by at least two
genes (Figure 5). The exons encoding the coiled-coil tail
domain starting at amino acid 850 are considerably
longer and the intron positions in almost all genes are not
identical. It is highly probable that further sequencing of
arthropod Mhc1 genes will reveal different exon-intron
patterns in the tail region while intron positions with one
or more of the already analysed genes will be shared.
Comparing the intron rich DapMhc1 and PdcMhc1 genes
with the mosquito and Drosophila Mhc1 genes, it is apparent that intron loss is a major determinant of arthropod
Mhc1 gene evolution. Loss of intron events have also been
found for many other arthropod genes [33]. However, as
long as data from further arthropod species is missing, it
cannot be excluded that some of the introns in the tail
region, that are not shared between the analyzed arthropods, have been gained during evolution. Very recently,
an analysis of eleven Drosophila genomes showed, that a
small number of introns have been gained in these species
[43]. The ancient Mhc1 gene is expected to contain all
intron positions that appear in at least one of the analysed
Mhc1 genes. Analysis of Mhc1 genes of further species
might add additional intron positions especially in the
tail region. The exon lengths of the ancient Mhc1 gene are
between 30 and 210 bp in the motor domain and up to
480 bp in the tail region. These short exons (compared to
e.g. the Drosophila Mhc1 gene) resemble exon lengths in
vertebrates and further comparative analysis with vertebrate muscle myosin heavy chain genes will reveal the
gene structure of the ancient Metazoa gene.

The Tribolium castaneum, Pediculus humanus corporis, and
Bombyx mori Mhc1 genes contain one additional and the
Daphnia pulex Mhc1 gene contains four additional clusters
of alternatively spliced exons compared to the Drosophila
melanogaster gene (Figure 1, Figure 2). All additional alternatively spliced exons are mutually exclusive and encode
parts of the motor domain. The additional exons of the
Tic, Pdc, and Bm Mhc1 genes encode alternative versions
of the loop-2 sequence while the additional exons of the
Dap Mhc1 gene are spread over the entire motor domain.
In each case, the 3' variant is more homologous to the corresponding sequences in the other Mhc1 genes than the 5'
variant (Figure 2).
A similar conservation is found for alternative exons with
multiple variants (Figure 2). In almost all cases, the most
3' variant is the most conserved one. Of the cluster of
alternative exons encoding part of the motor domain near
the ATP-binding site (exon 7 in DmMhc1), the last of the
variants is the only variant that is conserved in all species.
The other variants are either missing in certain species, or
are very similar to each other as well as to those of other
species, so that it is not clear whether they have been
derived from independent variant duplications or
whether they were present in a common ancestor. Thus,
all variants except for the most 3' variant evolved after the
separation of Daphnia from the other species. The variants
encoding the relay-helix and the relay-loop are highly
conserved. Conserved differences confine to only one or
two residues. The penultimate of the variants seems to be
the most conserved, although mutation of one residue
might change this. The exon encoding part of the converter domain has two highly conserved variants, the most
5' and the most 3' variants. The most 3' variant is distinguished from all other variants of this set of alternative
exons at the DNA level because the following intron starts
with a GT donor site. The most 5' exon is the most impor-

In addition to the Mhc1 gene, Aedes aegypti encodes a further muscle myosin heavy chain gene, named Mhc3 that
encodes only one variant of each of the alternatively
spliced exons of the Mhc1 gene. The presence of this gene
is not an artefact from sequencing or the assembly process. Both genes, Mhc1 and Mhc3, are very different at the
DNA level, and both are confirmed by several EST clones,
although the translated exons show high identities. That
also means, that the Mhc3 gene, that does not encode any
alternatively spliced exons, is expressed during the life
cycle of Aedes aegypti. However, there is not enough data
that shows that the Mhc3 gene is expressed in a biological
important (e.g. muscle-specific) manner. Note that the
combination of alternatively spliced exons does not corre-

spond to any of the tissue-specific combinations found in
Drosophila [18]. The Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus genome
contains another two muscle myosin heavy chain genes in
addition to the Mhc1 gene, named Mhc3 and Mhc4, that,
similarly to AeaMhc3, encode only one variant of most of
the alternatively spliced exons of the Mhc1 gene. In one
case, the intron between the presumed variant of the alternatively spliced exons and the following constitutive exon
disappeared. Unfortunately, there is not enough EST data
available for Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus to support any
of the myosin heavy chain genes. AeaMhc3, CpqMhc3, and
CpqMhc4 retained the same variants of the alternative
exons of the corresponding Mhc1 genes. The presence of
these further muscle myosin heavy chain genes is very surprising because the number of alternatively spliced exons
in the Mhc1 genes already allows for the transcription of
several hundred different muscle myosin isoforms. How
could it happen that the genomes of Aedes aegypti and
Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus encode such genes? According to the phylogenetic tree of the myosin heavy chain
genes, the Mhc3 and Mhc4 genes obviously appeared in
the common ancester of Aedes and Culex after the divergence from Anopheles gambiae. In addition, there is no evidence for a (partial) second muscle myosin heavy chain
gene in the Anopheles gambiae genome. Also, the carboxyterminal ends of AeaMhc3 and CpqMhc4, that are 3' elongations of the last constitutive exon, do not exist in the
AeaMhc1 and CpqMhc1 genes but have an identical counterpart in the AngMhc1 gene that is also supported by several EST clones. It is unlikely that these three organisms
have developed such a carboxy-terminal end of the
myosin gene independently from each other. Instead, it is
more probable that the ancient AeaMhc1 and CpqMhc1
genes have lost this specific carboxy-terminus after incorporation of the Mhc3 and Mhc4 genes into the genome.
This would mean that this carboxy-terminus is only used
in the specific combination of alternatively spliced exons
as found in the AeaMhc3 and CpqMhc4 genes. Whether
this is also true for the AngMhc1 gene has to be verified.
Based on their identity in sequence and gene structure it is
most probable that CpqMhc3 has been derived by gene
duplication of CpqMhc4 or CpqMhc4 is a duplication of
CpqMhc3.
There are two possibilities as to how the Mhc3 and Mhc4
genes could have appeared in the common ancestor of
Aedes and Culex. The genes have either been derived from
a duplication of the Mhc1 gene as part of a single gene or
chromosomal region duplication event. Or, a partially
spliced transcript of Mhc1 has been reincorporated into
the genome (Figure 7). If the Mhc3 and Mhc4 genes had
been derived from duplication, then all variants except
one of the alternative exons of only one of the (then) two
Mhc genes had to be lost in addition to the loss of both
terminal exons in Mhc3. Given the number of possible

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/21

transcripts of the Mhc1 gene and the possibility to duplicate alternative exons, it is very unlikely that there would
be a need for a second gene with the same set of alternative exons. If it were advantageous to keep two almost
identical genes, it would be very unlikely that only one of
the genes has lost all except one of its alternative exons. In
addition, there must have been a very strong evolutionary
pressure to keep exactly this special combination of alternative exons. The second possibility would mean that in
the first step during the splicing process all alternatively
spliced exons, which are not needed, are removed leaving
introns between the remaining alternatively spliced and
constitutive exons (Figure 7). In the second step, all
introns are spliced to yield the mRNA for translation. In
the case of the Mhc3 and Mhc4 genes, the transcript containing one combination of alternative exons but all
introns would have been integrated into the genome,
probably after retrotranscription. How should this type of
genes be called? At least the AeaMhc3 gene is completely
transcribed, and also CpqMhc3 and CpqMhc4 do not contain any premature stop codons or frameshift mutations.
However, compared to the corresponding Mhc1 genes
they retained only one variant exon of each of the alternative exons. Thus, they do not belong to the non-processed
pseudogenes. We would rather regard them as a new type
of partially processed pseudogenes.

Conclusion
25 arthropod muscle myosin heavy chain genes have been
identified and analysed. Compared to the well-studied
gene of Drosophila melanogaster other arthropod genes
might contain up to four additional alternatively spliced
exons encoding part of the motor domain. This considerably extends the possibilities of other arthropod species to
fine-tune myosin and thus muscle characteristics. An
ancient arthropod muscle myosin heavy chain gene has
been reconstructed whose gene structure can best be
explained if introns are lost and not gained during evolution of this gene. Aedes aegypti and Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus even encode further muscle myosin heavy chain
genes that, however, have lost all except one variant of the
alternatively spliced exons. These genes most probably
entered the genome by reincorporating a certain processed transcript and not via a gene or genomic region
duplication event. If the gene has been derived from a
processed transcript then splicing of alternative exons
must involve a first step, in which all other variants are
spliced out leaving intronic sequence around the variant
of choice. In a second step, all introns are spliced.

Model for the process of alternative splicing
Model for the process of alternative splicing. The model describes the three different origins of pseudogenes. Non-processed pseudogenes are often found adjacent to their paralogous functional gene and retain the same exon-intron structure.
Processed pseudogenes are marked by the absence of both 5' promotor sequence and introns, the presence of flanking direct
repeats, and are randomly integrated into the genome. In the case of the arthropod Mhc genes, these get in the first step transcribed. In a second step, the alternative exons get spliced resulting in a certain combination of alternative exons and retaining
the exon-intron structure. In the case of AeaMhc3, CpqMhc3, and CpqMhc4, these transcripts have been integrated into the
genome. Normally in a third step, the introns get spliced revealing the final mRNA ready for translation. Dark grey bars represent constitutive and coloured bars alternatively spliced exons. Light grey bars represent non-coding sequence.

obtained by TBLASTN searches against the insects section
of the NCBI wgs database (Table 1)[44]. The genes for the
Da, Der, Dg, Dmo, and Dv Mhc1 have been obtained using
the BLAT alignment tool [45] against the UCSC Genome
Browser database [46,47]. The DhMhc1 sequence was
derived from the NCBI nonredundant database. The
DapMhc1 sequence has been obtained by a TBLASTN
search against the 9× assembly of the Daphnia pulex
genome provided by the DOE Joint Genome Institute [48]
and the Daphnia Genomics Consortium [49]. The
NavMhc1 gene was derived from version 1.0 of the Nasonia vitripennis assembly provided by the Human Genome
Sequencing Center at Baylor College of Medicine [50].

The exons of the genes were predicted by manual inspection of the nucleotide sequences. For the correct prediction of the transcriptional start and the 3' terminal exons,
the analysis of cDNA and EST data, that has been obtained
from the EST section of NCBI's nucleotide database, was
necessary. In particular, the following data has been
obtained: For TicMhc1, only a small amount of EST data is
available, confirming the prediction of exon2. There is not
enough data to exclude a further untranslated 5' exon, as
well as further C-terminal exons. For AngMhc1, several
EST and cDNA clones support exon1 and the different Ctermini. The C-termini of AeaMhc1 are also supported by
several EST clones (e.g. GenBank ID DV384821). Exon1

of AeaMhc3 is supported by EST data. Exon1 of AeaMhc3
has been used for the identification of exon1 of AeaMhc1,
as there is no direct evidence by EST data. Surprisingly, it
is found 26,432 bp before the translation start codon
ATG. For AmMhc1, the N-terminus is not supported by
EST or cDNA data. Therefore it is not clear whether there
might be an additional 5' untranslated exon. The C-termini are supported by several EST and cDNA clones (e.g.
GenBank ID CK629939). The C-terminus of DapMhc1 is
supported by EST data (e.g. GenBank ID BJ927473), while
there is no EST data for the N-terminus. For BmMhc1,
exon2 is supported by EST data. However, the corresponding EST clones are not long enough to exclude a further 5'
untranslated exon. Both C-termini of BmMhc1 are supported by EST clones (e.g. GenBank ID BP179837). The
genomic DNA of the BmMhc1 gene contains a gap in the
coiled-coil tail region. The missing amino acid sequence
has been derived from EST data. However, the exon/
intron structure in the corresponding region remains
unresolved.
Analysis of the relationship of the alternatively spliced
exons
All alternatively spliced exons have been aligned manually. Some kind of relationship is already obvious from
these sequence alignments. To get a more quantitative
description, sequence identity matrices have been calculated for each set of aligned exons. Subsequently, sets of
homologous exons from all Mhc1 genes have been clustered by sequence similarity. We have visualized the
results in graphs that have to be read in columns. The
highest identity between an exon listed on top and any
variant of a certain Mhc1 protein listed on the left side has
been set to 1 (red colour) while the differences between
the values of the lower identity exons and the value of the
highest identity have been plotted for the other combinations of exons. Thus, in every column the highest identity
of the named exon to one of the variants of the other
Mhc1 proteins is visualized.
Building trees
The phylogenetic tree was generated using neighbour
joining and the Bootstrap (1,000 replicates) method as
implemented in ClustalW (standard settings) [51] and
drawn by using TreeView [52]. The sequence of DapMhc1
has been used as outgroup.
