Genetic mechanisms involved in the evolution of
the cephalopod camera eye revealed by
transcriptomic and developmental studies
Masa-aki Yoshida and Atsushi Ogura*

Abstract
Background: Coleoid cephalopods (squids and octopuses) have evolved a camera eye, the structure of which is
very similar to that found in vertebrates and which is considered a classic example of convergent evolution. Other
molluscs, however, possess mirror, pin-hole, or compound eyes, all of which differ from the camera eye in the
degree of complexity of the eye structures and neurons participating in the visual circuit. Therefore, genes
expressed in the cephalopod eye after divergence from the common molluscan ancestor could be involved in eye
evolution through association with the acquisition of new structural components. To clarify the genetic
mechanisms that contributed to the evolution of the cephalopod camera eye, we applied comprehensive
transcriptomic analysis and conducted developmental validation of candidate genes involved in coleoid
cephalopod eye evolution.
Results: We compared gene expression in the eyes of 6 molluscan (3 cephalopod and 3 non-cephalopod) species
and selected 5,707 genes as cephalopod camera eye-specific candidate genes on the basis of homology searches
against 3 molluscan species without camera eyes. First, we confirmed the expression of these 5,707 genes in the
cephalopod camera eye formation processes by developmental array analysis. Second, using molecular
evolutionary (dN/dS) analysis to detect positive selection in the cephalopod lineage, we identified 156 of these
genes in which functions appeared to have changed after the divergence of cephalopods from the molluscan
ancestor and which contributed to structural and functional diversification. Third, we selected 1,571 genes,
expressed in the camera eyes of both cephalopods and vertebrates, which could have independently acquired a
function related to eye development at the expression level. Finally, as experimental validation, we identified three
functionally novel cephalopod camera eye genes related to optic lobe formation in cephalopods by in situ
hybridization analysis of embryonic pygmy squid.
Conclusion: We identified 156 genes positively selected in the cephalopod lineage and 1,571 genes commonly
found in the cephalopod and vertebrate camera eyes from the analysis of cephalopod camera eye specificity at
the expression level. Experimental validation showed that the cephalopod camera eye-specific candidate genes
include those expressed in the outer part of the optic lobes, which unique to coleoid cephalopods. The results of
this study suggest that changes in gene expression and in the primary structure of proteins (through positive
selection) from those in the common molluscan ancestor could have contributed, at least in part, to cephalopod
camera eye acquisition.

Background
Animal eyes have long been considered a classic example of convergent evolution. In recent decades, this view
has changed due to the discovery of shared developmental regulatory genes for eye formation. Several genes,
such as Pax-6/eyeless (ey) [1], eyes absent [2], dachshund
[3], and sine oculis [4], together with their orthologs in
metazoan animals, are able to induce the formation of
ectopic eyes in flies and have been regarded as essential
eye regulator genes among metazoan animals [5,6].
Most of the genes involved in eye development had
already existed in the last common ancestors of cnidarians and bilaterians [7]. Such evidence suggests that
some conserved genes have similarly contributed to eye
development across a wide range of animals.
In contrast to the above discovery, the structural
diversity of the eye is also evident among metazoan animals, and might have affected the diversification of species themselves by changing their morphology, behavior,
and ecological strategy. The morphological unit of the
eye has many different components such as muscle,
lens, photoreceptor, optic nerve and visual center of
brain, each with there own evolutionary histories [8,9].
Molluscs provide an appropriate model for the study of
the evolutionary history of these various eye components as a number of different eye types are present in
one phylum. In this study, we focused on the evolution
of the camera eye in coleoid cephalopods (octopuses,
cuttlefishes, and squids). There are two well-known
cephalopod eye types; the pin-hole eye, found in nautiloids, and the camera eye, seen in coleoid cephalopods
(Figure 1). Comparative studies on the camera eye of
coleoid cephalopods and the pin-hole eye of nautiloids
have begun to reveal the evolutionary histories of the
various eye components and their genetic backgrounds.
The coleoid cephalopods have an iris, a nearly circular
lens, a vitreous cavity, and photoreceptor cells that form

Page 2 of 11

a retina. The nautiloid eye, however, consists only of a
retina. These structural differences are the result of
modifications that occurred after the divergence of
cephalopods from the common molluscan ancestor [10].
Differences in visual cognition between the eye of the
coleoid cephalopods and that of other molluscs appear
to be a reflection of their complicated brain anatomy, as
well as of their elaborated accessory eye structures [11].
The optic lobes of the coleoid cephalopods include secondary interneurons connected to photoreceptor cells,
the cortex of which is arranged in four layers and
resembles the organization of the deep layers of the vertebrate retina [12]. In contrast, lower molluscs, such as
Aplysia, have tiny neuronal clusters between photoreceptors and the brain [13]. Therefore, the complicated
cortex strucutre of the optic lobes of the coleiod cephalopods might be a new phenotype obtained in the
coleoid cephalopod lineage.
The question remains as to what genetic background
could have contributed to the evolution of the coleoid
cephalopod camera eye. We hypothesized that changes
in expresssion patterns and functions of pre-existing
genes as well as the gain and loss of genes have played
important roles in the evolution of the camera eye in
coleoid cephalopods. Previously, Ogura et al. [14]
revealed that more than 60% of octopus eye ESTs were
commonly observed in the human eye, indicating that
changes of expression patterns and functions have been
involved in the evolution of the camera eyes in the octopus and humans.
To determine the genes specifically involved in camera-eye development and those for which functions may
have changed during camera eye evolution, we applied
the following three strategies (Figure 2). First, we utilized “in vitro homology search array technology” to
remove genes commonly expressed across molluscan
eyes and estimate genes specifically expressed in the

Figure 1 Phylogenetic view of molluscan eye diversification. Camera eyes were independently acquired in the coleoid cephalopod (squids
and octopuses) and vertebrate lineages.

coleoid cephalopod camera eye. This strategy was developed for the comparative genomic study of nonsequenced species with the aid of a bioinformatic
approach to probe design [15]. In this analysis we used
a 60 mer oligonucleotide library based on the expressed
gene sequences of the octopus, squid, nautilus and scallop, in which nearly 10,000 annotated genes were examined. We then estimated candidate genes uniquely
expressed in camera-type coleoid cephalopod eyes. Second, we compared gene expression patterns among
three developmental stages in pygmy squid, which we
used as a coleoid cephalopod model, to validate and elucidate gene expression in the camera eye formation process. It is known that the eye formation process can be
observed during stages 20-25 in the pygmy squid, and
we utilized embryos at stage 20, 25 and 30 for the developmental array. Third, to explore genes that have changed functionally, we determined whether the candidate
genes in the coleoid cephalopods were under positive
selection pressure. Finally, we selected four candidate
genes, two transcription factor genes that might have
changed the expression patterns of down-stream genes,
and two positively selected genes that might have
experienced functional changes. We then validated their
localization at various developmental stages in our
cephalopod model, the pygmy squid.

Results
Identifying genes specifically expressed in the coleoid
cephalopod camera eye

To collect cephalopod camera eye-specific candidate
genes, we performed an in vitro homology search using
an array designed to estimate gene expression among
species on the basis of inter-species hybridization signals.

In this in vitro homology search array, probes were
designed, using the probe design method described in
Ogura et al. [15], to estimate distantly related homologs
of molluscan eye genes. Microarray probes from Octopus
vulgaris (octopus), Loligo bleekeri (squid), Idiosepius
paradoxus (pygmy squid), Mizuhopecten (Patinopecten)
yessoensis (scallop) and Nautilus pompilius (nautilus)
were derived from our eye EST libraries and the NCBI
EST database. We applied total RNA samples from the
pygmy squid, scallop and nautilus to a custom Agilent
microarray designed to detect specific gene expression in
molluscan eyes. The microarray results for camera eyespecific genes allowed us to eliminate 173 and 162 genes
found to be significantly expressed, using the Feature
Extraction output (see methods), in the nautilus and scallop eye RNA, respectively. In addition to elimination on
the basis of the microarray results, we also eliminated
genes having homolog(s) among the nautilus or scallop
eye ESTs, based on BLASTN and TBLASTX searches
(<1e-4). As a result, a total of 5,707 genes (2,607, 1,014
and 2,086 genes from the pygmy squid, squid, and octopus, respectively) were selected as cephalopod camera
eye-specific candidate genes (Figure 2). Although this
array-based estimation may include false-positive genes
(expressed in nautilus or scallop eyes but not detected in
the array), as described in Gilad et al. [16], we expect
highly conserved genes (common eye genes and housekeeping genes) to be eliminated using this analysis.
Confirmation of cephalopod camera eye-specific genes
expression in the developmental stages of the pygmy
squid by developmental array

Next, we performed microarray experiments using
pygmy squid embryonic RNA to estimate genes

contributing to the camera eye developmental process in
coleoid cephalopods. We extracted total RNAs from
whole embryos at stage 20 and stage 30 (hatchlings),
and from the eyes at stage 25. The reason for the selection of these three stages is that essential developmental
events occur in each stage: stage 20 sees the establishment of eye placodes, stage 25 sees eye vesicle closure
and the onset of lens formation, and stage 30 sees the
completion of eye development (though genes used for
the growth and maintenance of eyes are still active).
Among the cephalopod camera eye-specific candidate
genes selected above, 53.8% (3,075/5,707 genes) of the
genes were found to have a positive signal against
pygmy squid embryonic RNA.
We then checked positive gene expression at the three
developmental stages, as the highly expressed genes are
expected to be specifically involved in the developmental
events occurring at each stage. We isolated 115 genes
positive against only embryonic RNA at stage 20. Similarly, 294 and 214 genes were isolated at stage 25 and
stage 30, respectively (Figure 3). After eliminating genes
expressed in the adult eye of the pygmy squid, 6.38%
(141, 73, 150 from the pygmy squid, squid, and octopus,
respectively) of the genes were selected as showing high
expression at these embryonic stages.
Estimation of lineage-specific functional changes in
coleoid cephalopod camera eye-specific genes by
molecular evolutionary analysis

We hypothesized that taxon-specific gene modification
contributed to the evolutionary steps in coleoid cephalopod camera eye development. To clarify the involvement
of gene recruitment and subsequent positive selection in

Page 4 of 11

camera eye acquisition, we estimated the dN/dS ratio of
camera eye-specific candidate genes after the divergence
of cephalopods from the common molluscan ancestor.
The cephalopod camera eye-specific data were concatenated together with homologous genes estimated by
BLASTN and TBLASTX searches against the molluscan
NCBI nucleotide collection and molluscan ESTs (an evalue of less than 1e-20). Phylogenetic trees based on
the gene sets were analyzed using the Codeml program
in PAML ver. 4.4 b [17] under the F3x4 model. Finally,
we obtained 1,391 sets of multiple alignments including
cephalopods and other molluscs, and dN/dS values of
the camera eye-specific genes. Of the camera eye-specific genes, 156 (68, 43, 24 from the pygmy squid, octopus, and squid, respectively) were identified as positively
selected genes in the cephalopod lineage (the dN/dS
ratio was significantly higher than 2, Additional file 1,
Table S1).
Homologs of the cornichon gene were found among
the octopus and the pygmy squid ESTs (5primeCluster0328, DB919298), and both homologs were found to
be positively selected genes in the cephalopod lineage.
Cornichon-like genes in vertebrates have been shown to
be located directly downstream of Pax-6 [18]. It is of
great interest that the region downstream of Pax-6 is
included among the camera eye-specific genes, although
it is still unclear whether the squid cornichon is controlled by Pax-6 or not.
Centaurin gamma is a small GTP family member with
NTPase activity [19] (Additional file 2, Figure S1, Additional file 3, Supplementary data S1). It is known to be
expressed in human cancer cells is known; however, its
function in vertebrate development is unclear. Localization
of the centaurin gamma homolog (OctEye_3919F_082) is
described below.
Determination of common and unique genes by
comparative gene expression analysis of cephalopods
and vertebrates

Figure 3 Differential gene expression profiles of camera eye
genes at different developmental stages. The Venn diagram
indicates numbers of cephalopod camera eye-specific genes for
three cephalopod species (PS, the pygmy squid; S, squid; O,
octopus). Each box represent the number of genes expressed at the
three embryonic stages of the pygmy squid found in the
developmental array. In total, 3,075 genes (2,320, 235 and 519 from
PS, S, and O, respectively) were positive against pygmy squid
embryonic RNA.

We next investigated whether coleoid cephalopod camera eye-specific genes could be found in the vertebrate
camera eye by comparing gene expression profiles
across a wide range of animal phyla. A comparison of
the coleoid cephalopod eye-specific candidate genes
showed that 1,571 have an e-value of less than 1e-04 in
BLASTN and TBLASTX searches against vertebrate eye
EST data including the National Eye Institute’s NEI
Bank, NCBI UniGene, and Bodymap data (Figure 2,
Additional file 1, Table S1). We found that 56.2% (839,
16, 28 genes from the pygmy squid, squid and octopus,
respectively) of these probes have a positive signal
against pygmy squid adult eye RNA. This indicates that
these candidates include genes commonly expressed in
cephalopod species, and that these genes are also

involved in coleoid cephalopod camera eye. The list of
homologous genes indicates that 63.7% of the genes
(578, 38, 384 genes from the pygmy squid, squid and
octopus, respectively) are function-known in vertebrate
genome annotation and GO classification analysis. We
then examined the biological functions of the camera
eye-specific genes using single enrichment analysis
against total cephalopod ESTs except the coleoid cephalopod camera eye-specific genes (those with an e-value
of less than 0.01, Additional file 4, Figure S2). The GO
classification analysis showed that fifteen terms associated with “Molecular Function” were significantly
over-represented in the camera eye-specific genes,
including genes for protein binding, nucleotide binding,
structural constituent of ribosomes, ATP binding, translation initiation factor activity, GTP binding, zinc ion
binding, metal ion binding, catalytic activity, binding,
protein homodimerization activity, and transferase activity (single enrichment analysis using the blast2go, an P
< 0.01, Table 1). Terms of “Biological Process” category
were also found to be an over-represented, including
translation, intracellular protein transport, signal transduction, small GTPase mediated signal transduction,
protein transport, protein modification process, and
anti-apoptosis. On the other hand, no particular term of
“Cellular Component” was over-reperesented in the
camera eye-specific genes. These over-represented GO
terms shown above also represent many Ras-like signal

transduction proteins and zinc finger proteins in the
camera eye-specific gene set.
To estimate the genes possibly related to camera eye
specification through subsequent structural and functional gene expression, we further manually identified
several transcriptional factors using the GO classification and domain estimation results obtained by the
Pfam. Homologs of six homeobox 2 (00672_Oc_096),
ets-related isoform 4 (DB913089), lim domain-containing (06182_Oc_5_043), lim and sh3 domain protein
(OctEye_4576F_074) and high mobility group b3b
(01791_Oc_5_056) were found among the camera eyespecific genes. There were also many zinc finger homologs (02158_Oc_5_047, 06176_Oc_5_032, 5primeCluster0192, OctRet_1427F_085, DB912036, DB912793,
DB914855, DB918248 and DB918617). Molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that the squid Ets-4 homolog
was closely related to the vertebrate Erg and Fli-1 genes
(Additional file 5, Figure S3, Additional file 6, Supplementary data S2), which are major regulators of blood
vessel development [20]. The squid Ets-4 homolog is
thought not to have any putative function in the squid
blood vessels due to its expression pattern (described
below, Figure 4), although many small vessels supply
blood to the cephalopod retina [21]. When we applied
an in vitro homology search array technique to a comparison of the pygmy squid and human transcripts [15],
a probe based on the Ets-4 homolog reproducibly crossreacted with human RNA (unpublished data). These
results indicate not only that our array could effectively
identify similar expression patterns across animal phyla,
but also that the expression of the Ets-4 homolog was
restricted to the camera eye of vertebrates and
cephalopods.
Functional analysis of four candidate genes selected
among the coleoid cephalopod camera eye-expressed
genes

To clarify the function of the coleoid cephalopod camera eye-specific candidate genes in the camera eye formation process, we cloned and analyzed the
localization of transcripts of three candidate genes in
the pygmy squid embryo. We selected the Ets-4,
HMGb3 and Hla-b associated transcript homologs
from the transcription factor genes commonly
expressed in vertebrates and cephalopods due to their
high expression signals and the existence of human
orthologs for further functional analysis (Additional
file 1, Table S1). The centaurin gamma homolog was
also selected from the positively selected gene candidate genes in the cephalopod lineage as it showed a
high dN/dS ratio and had a human ortholog (Additional file 1, Table S1, Additional file 2, Figure S1,
Additional file 3, Supplementary data S1).

Among the above-mentioned genes common to both
cephalopods and vertebrates, the Ets-4 homolog showed
positive expression against embryonic RNA. We validated its expression in the three developmental stages
(20, 25 and 30) as well as its localization by in situ
hybridization using pygmy squid embryos. Ets-4 transcripts were localized in the surface of the optic lobe
and in part of the brain (Figure 4a-c). The transcripts
appeared in tissues surrounding the future eye and the
tips of the arm anlagens of the embryo at the stage 20
(Figure 4a). In terms of brain development, primodial
brain lobes appears before stage 20 (even in stage 18)
[22]. Optic lobes become visible on the inner side of the
eye vesicles at stage 21. The retinal primodium is distinguishable by rectangular cells at stage 18, and retinal
pigmentation starts at stage 20. Embryos at stage 25
show a dark brown retina. The Ets-4 expression then
appear to be restricted to the part of middle subesophageal mass (Figure 4d), the external part of the optic
lobes (Figure 4e) and paired structure aside the buccal
mass at stage 22 (Figure 4b) and stage 25 (Figure 4c) in
comparison to the brain atlass [23]. Strong siganals were
observed in the most external layer, which correspond
to outer granular layer of the optic lobes (Figure 4e).
This expression pattern is possibly related to the visual
cognition system of the squid as the granular layer of
the optic lobes are directly connected to the photoreceptors and act as secondary neurons of the visual circuit. HMGb3 transcripts appeared in the body of the
stage 20 embryo including the eye field, mantle, and the
tip of the arm anlagens (data not shown), but were
restricted to the inner part of the optic lobes at stage 25
(Figure 4f). Hla-b associated transcript-specific staining
was observed in the head region, including the optic
lobes, of the stage 22 embryo (Figure 4g). Localization
of the centaurin gamma homolog from positively
selected genes within the squid embryo was also analyzed using an in situ hybridization assay (Figure 5a, b).
Transcripts were continuously distributed in the optic
lobes (Figure 5d), and this expression pattern suggests
that the centaurin gamma homolog is related to developmental or proliferative steps in the optic lobe
neurons.

Discussion
Genetic mechanisms involved in camera eye evolution of
the coleoid cephalopods

The coleoid cephalopod camera eye-specific candidate
genes selected by our analysis might be divided into two
groups. The first group consists of genes that commonly
exist in animals, but whose expression level has been
changed through the structural changes of the eyes after
the divergence of the cephalopods. The Ets-4 homolog,
for example, was expressed in the granular cell layers

squids [15], we thought it possible to remove highly
expressed molluscan eye genes, including housekeeping
genes, from the list of candidate genes to estimate
cephalopod specificity. The cephalopod camera eye-specific candidate gene set also contain genes common
among animals with eyes, all of which should, ideally, be
removed along with the nautilus and scallop gene pool
but which nevertheless remained due to the use of
incomplete gene sets.

specifically found in the optic lobes in coleoid cephalopods. The fact that a large proportion of the genes
expressed in the octopus eye was found in the genomes
of other animals [14] supports the notion that the role
of the genes might have changed in relation to the
structural changes in the various eye types. The second
group comprises genes that commonly exist, even in
molluscan eyes, but whose functions have been changed
by positive selection in relation to camera eye development in cephalopods. We identified more than a hundred genes that appear to have undergone positive
selection (dN/dS values of more than 2) in the coleoid
cephalopod lineage. The genetic mechanism represented
by these two groups seems to have been contributed to
acquisition of the camera eye.
Because the in vitro homology search array could be
used to detect highly expressed genes in humans and

One of the most intriguing events in coleoid cephalopod
camera eye evolution is the transition from the simple
eye to a more complex visual eye. The transition was
accompanied by the evolution of the eye components
including the optic lobes, visual center of the brain. In
this transition, expression changes and functional
chagnges of the camera eye specific candidate genes
might have been contributed to the acquisition of the
eye compnents. For example, Ets-4 localization in the
five-layered optic lobes of the pygmy squid appears to
be involved in the organization of outer granular layer.
As Erg and Fli-1, orthologs of Ets-4 in vertebretes, are
major inducers of blood vessel development [20] and Dets-3 and D-ets-6, orthologs of Ets-4 in Drosophila, are
known to be expressed in the ventral nerve cord [24,25],
it is speculated that Ets-4 of the pygmy squid was
recruited for the development of different organs, particularly in the conversion of neuron responses in cephalopod optic lobes.
The cornichon and centaurin gamma homologs identified as camera eye specific genes in cephalopods are also
known to be expressed in the vertebrate camera eye.
Even though these transduction-related genes are completely function-unknown, together with their upstream
and downstream, their observed localization in the optic
lobe suggests their involvement in the neuronal development of the coleoid cephalopod camera eye. The
HMGb3 and Hla-b associated transcript homologs may
be involved in visual circuit formation through chromatin remodeling and initiation of subsequent gene expressions. As a consequence of our study, a number of
common genes from the common molluscan ancestor
have been shown to be involved in coleoid cephalopod
camera eye evolution through changes in their expression patterns and functions.

Conclusion
In this study, we selected 5,707 genes as coleoid cephalopod camera eye-specific candidates by homology
searches and comparative expression against the nautilus and scallop eyes. We applied a molecular evolutionary approach to the cephalopod camera eye candidates

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/180

to identify genes that had functionally changed after the
divergence of cephalopods from the common ancestor.
Our developmental approach, which included developmental arrays and in situ hybridization using the pygmy
squid embryos, indicated the contribution of camera
eye-specific genes to the eye developmental process. In
particular, some camera eye specific genes, such as the
Ets-4, cornichon, and centaurin gamma homologs, was
shown to have contributed to camera eye evolution
through the development of a complex visual circuit.

DB920055]. Redundant sequences in the I. paradoxus
ESTs were found using BLASTCLUST and removed.
These data were concatenated and used as molluscan
eye ESTs in the subsequent analyses, and are available
upon request. We added the pubmed data sets for vertebrate eye genes, obtained from a public database, to
identify eye gene expression across distantly related species. Finally, we obtained 12,128 molluscan probes
(4,657, 1,483, 3,377, 1,493 and 1,118 from the pygmy
squid, squid, octopus, scallop and nautilus, respectively)
and designed a custom microarray with the Agilent 8 ×
15K format custom microarray service.

Pygmy squid cultures and RNA isolation

Japanese pygmy squid, Idiosepius paradoxus, specimens
were obtained from Chita Peninsula, Nagoya, Japan and
kept in our laboratory, as previously described [26],
where the embryos were staged [22]. The embryonic
eyes of stage 25 embryos were dissected from the body
using forceps and used for RNA extraction. A specimen
of Nautilus pompilius was purchased from a retail aquarium in Kanagawa, Japan. A specimen of the Japanese
scallop, Mizuhopecten (Patinopecten) yessoensis, was
purchased from the Tokyo Central Wholesale Fish Market (caught in Aomori). Total RNA was extracted from
the embryos or adult tissues using an E. Z. N. A. Mollusc RNA kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Inc.), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
Probe design for the in vitro homology search of the
molluscan eyes

Molluscan EST data for Loligo bleekeri (squid), Mizuhopecten (Patinopecten) yessoensis (scallop) and Nautilus
pompilius (nautilus) were obtained from cDNA libraries
constructed using the Creator™ SMART™ Library
Construction Kit (Takara Clontech) with the TRIMMER-DIRECT cDNA normalization kit (Evrogen) and
introduced into DH5a electro competent cells (Takara).
The 5’ regions of the cDNA libraries were sequenced
using the M13 forward primer (5-TGT AAA ACG ACG
GCC AGT-3) and Big Dye Terminator v3.1 (Applied
Biosystems) on an ABI3030 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Raw data for these ESTs are available under the
following accession numbers: [DDBJ:FY298839FY302524]. The sequence clean-up program Lucy (The
Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, MD; http://
www.tigr.org/softlab) was used to trim vector sequences
and low-quality sequences from the raw data. These
ESTs were assembled using the MIRA assembler 3.2.1
[27], and then used for the subsequent analyses. The
octopus ESTs were obtained as previously described
[14] and from the following website http://www.cib.nig.
ac.jp/dda/database/octopus.htm. We adopted ESTs of I.
paradoxus from the NCBI EST database under the following accession numbers: [DDBJ, DB910977-

Developmental array

To perform the comparative analysis of various developmental stages, we applied total RNA samples from the
molluscan species onto the custom microarray. Total
RNA from the embryonic stages were labeled and
applied separately. Briefly, 0.5 μg of total RNA from
each sample was used to synthesize fluorescent-labelled
cRNA using Cyanine 3-CTP according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Agilent Quick Amp Labeling Kit, onecolor). Labeled DNA was hybridized for 16 hr at 65°C
on the custom array. After hybridization, the microarray
slides were washed according to the standard protocol
(Agilent Technologies) and scanned on an Agilent
microarray scanner. Data were analyzed using the Agilent Feature Extraction Software (v10.7, Additional file
7, Table S2). We adopted the microarray data under the
following accession number [CIBEX, CBX187]. We
selected wells (spots) exhibited a signal “well above the
background” and “positive and siginificant” as siginificantly expressed genes using the Feature Extraction
output.
Databases for homology searches among molluscs and
vertebrates

Molluscan eye ESTs were obtained as described above.
For comparison with the vertebrate eye EST data, we
used data from Bodymap, UniGene, and NEI Bank
(Accession numbers are listed as Additional file 8, Supplement data S3, Additional file 9, Supplement data S4,
Additional file 10, Supplement data S5, respectively).
For the comparative analysis of gene expression, we
obtained human-eye ESTs (929 contigs) of the retina,
corneal endothelium, cornea, and iris from BodyMap
[28]. NEI Bank, maintained by the National Eye Institute, a division of the NIH (USA), contains data
(680,045 contigs) for several human-eye cDNA libraries
[29], including tissue-separated databases of the ciliary
body, cornea, fovea, iris, lens, optic nerve, retina, RPE
choroids, trabecular meshwork, and other tissues/organs.
We also used data sets from the vertebrate lens, retinal
and eye libraries (484, 202 contigs from humans, mice,

Yoshida and Ogura BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:180
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/180

rats, rabbits, dogs, pigs, sticklebacks, zebrafish, salmon,
and pufferfish) in the NCBI UniGene [30].
Functional annotation

Functional annotation was conducted as follows. Gene
ontology, which is defined by the Gene Ontology Consortium [31,32], and used to categorize genes by (1)
Molecular Function, (2) Biological Process, or (3) Cellular Component, was used to categorize cephalopod eye
ESTs for the octopus, squid and pygmy squid. We
adopted all GO terms for categorizing cephalopod eye
genes using a blast2GO [33]. Enrichment analysis of the
camera eye-specific genes against total cephalopod ESTs
excluding the camera eye-specific genes, was carried out
with the blast2GO program (using Fisher’s exact test, an
e-value of less than 0.01, Table 1). The Pfam database
[34] was used to estimate the domain structure of the
molluscan eye ESTs. Domains in the translated amino
acid sequences of the molluscan eye ESTs were estimated using batch search from the Pfam website.
We determined transcriptional factors in the cephalopod camera eye-specific candidate genes manually using
the sequence description obtained by the blast2GO, and
the HMM-name obtained by the Pfam programs.
Homologs of six homeobox 2 (00672_Oc_096), etsrelated isoform 4 (DB913089), lim domain-containing
(06182_Oc_5_043), lim and sh3 domain protein
(OctEye_4576F_074) and high mobility group b3b
(01791_Oc_5_056) were identified as they have homeobox, ETS, LIM, LIM and high mobility group domains.
We also identified genes involved in signal transduction
cascades, homologs of rab5 protein (02945_Oc_5_065),
ras-related protein rab-2 (DB916866), member ras oncogene family (ika1224-No19_E06_001, DB913730 and
DB919285), ran gtpase-activating protein (DB912649),
and dishevelled associated activator of morphogenesis 1
like (03249_Oc_5_081), which are possibly related to
camera eye specification. Indeed, the Ras superfamily of
small GTPases regulate many cellular regulatory and
developmental pathways, including diurnal regulation of
the octopus photoreceptors [35]. As previously reported
[14], retinal arrestin (08322_Oc_5_073), retinal dehydrogenase (DB913426), neuron-specific enolase (5primeCluster0558), and gelsolin (07345_Oc_5_049,
08462_Oc_5_015) are commonly expressed and are
thought to be involved in camera eye formation.
Molecular evolutionary (dN/dS) analysis

We calculated the dN/dS ratio in the cephalopod lineage
(squids or octopus) after divergence from other molluscs
to estimate genes changed through positive selection in
the cephalopod camera eye. The nucleotide sequences
and deduced amino-acid sequences of the cephalopod
eye cDNAs isolated in the present study were aligned

Page 9 of 11

together with estimated homologs of other molluscs
using homology searches. The homologs were selected
using BLASTN and TBLASTX against the non-cephalopod molluscan eye ESTs (scallop and nautilus) and the
molluscan gene sets obtained from the NCBI nucleotide
and EST collections (Taxonomy ID: 6447). Homology
searches of the GenBank non-redundant database using
BLAST with a cutoff value of < 1e-20 produced matches
against 1,391 of the contigs. The homologs were concatenated and aligned using the Clustal W program
(default options) [36]. After removing gap positions, the
dN/dS ratio (Kn divergence per Ks divergence) between
each homologous gene set was estimated using the maximum likelihood method of Goldman and Yang [37], as
implemented in the codeml program of the PAML
package [17] under the F3 × 4 model. The statistical significance of positively selected genes was determined
using a one-tailed student’s t-test. The above-mentioned
protocol was systematically performed using both Perl
and shell scripts.
Targeted-gene cloning in the pygmy squid and
expression analysis

We selected the cephalopod camera eye candidate genes
using the above-mentioned criteria. Orthologous candidates in the pygmy squid were then cloned to validate
their expression pattern. Fragments of the Ets-4,
HMGb3, Hla-b associated transcript, cornichon and
centaurin gamma homologs were obtained by PCR reaction using pygmy squid eye cDNA. Reverse transcription
was carried out using a PrimeScript™ RT Reagent kit
(TaKaRa), and the primers used to amplify the target
genes are listed in Additional file 11, Table S3.
Longer length cDNAs of the Ets-4 and centaurin
gamma homologs were obtained using a BD SMARTer
RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) cDNA amplification kit (Clontech). Ready-to-use first strand cDNA
was synthesized according to the manufacturer’s protocol using pygmy squid embryonic eye RNA. Total RNA
was prepared from a number of pygmy squid hatchling
specimens using an RNeasy mini RNA extraction kit
(QIAGEN). The primers used to amplify the cDNA
extremities were Ets4-5RACE, AAGTTGTATCACC
TGGGAGGGCCG, Ets4-3RACE, CTTTTTGCAGC
GCCGGTTCCTATT, centaurin gamma-5RACE, ACG
CGAGGATTGCTTTCACTGATGG, and centaurin
gamma-3RACE, GGTCCGCCGGAGATGCAGTTTA
CTC. The RACE reaction products were cloned into a
plasmid using a pGEM T-vector system (Promega). Plasmid DNA from transformant colonies was purified with
a GenElute™ Plasmid Miniprep kit (Sigma-Aldrich).
Both strands of the plasmid DNA were fully sequenced
downstream of an insert site by the dideoxy chain-termination method using a BigDye ® Terminator v. 3.1.

Yoshida and Ogura BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:180

The sequences are available under the following accession numbers: Ets-4 homolog, AB586703; centaurin
gamma homolog, AB586704.
Short fragments of these genes were amplified by PCR
and subcloned into the pGEM T-vector. These were
then used as a template to generate digoxigenin (DIG)labeled antisense and sense probes by in vitro transcription with a DIG-RNA labeling kit (Roche) using SP6
RNA polymerase (Roche) and T7 RNA polymerase
(Roche). Whole-mount in situ hybridization for stage
20, 22, and 25 of the pygmy squid embryos was carried
out using established procedures [26].
