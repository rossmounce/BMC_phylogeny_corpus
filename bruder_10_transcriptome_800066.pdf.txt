Abstract
Background: The ferret (Mustela putorius furo) represents an attractive animal model for the study of respiratory
diseases, including influenza. Despite its importance for biomedical research, the number of reagents for molecular
and immunological analysis is restricted. We present here a parallel sequencing effort to produce an extensive EST
(expressed sequence tags) dataset derived from a normalized ferret cDNA library made from mRNA from ferret blood,
liver, lung, spleen and brain.
Results: We produced more than 500000 sequence reads that were assembled into 16000 partial ferret genes. These
genes were combined with the available ferret sequences in the GenBank to develop a ferret specific microarray
platform. Using this array, we detected tissue specific expression patterns which were confirmed by quantitative real
time PCR assays. We also present a set of 41 ferret genes with even transcription profiles across the tested tissues,
indicating their usefulness as housekeeping genes.
Conclusion: The tools developed in this study allow for functional genomic analysis and make further development of
reagents for the ferret model possible.
Background
The ferret is an important model for pulmonary research
studies because of the long trachea, large lung capacity
and bronchiolar branching. It is commonly used for studies of infectious diseases and is susceptible to infection
with a large number of pathogens, such as influenza
virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona
virus, and canine distemper virus [1-8]. The ferret is an
essential model for influenza research as it develops a
number of the clinical symptoms of influenza that are
also seen in humans and, in contrast to mice, can be
infected by human isolates of influenza virus [9]. With
the recent two-animal ruling by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for the licensing of drugs or vaccines directed against diseases of low or no incidence, the
ferret represents an inexpensive small, non-rodent animal model. Despite the fact that ferrets have been used in

biomedical research for decades, little is known about the
genome of M. p. furo. Currently, there are only a limited
number of partial or full length cDNAs present in the
GenBank. This not only impacts the number of molecular genetic assays available for analysis, but also hinders
the development of antibody-based assays, such as flow
cytometry. The lack of reagents for molecular analysis of
the mechanisms involved in infection and immunogenic
protection is restricted, limiting the usefulness of this
animal model.
Recent advances in DNA sequencing have drastically
increased the sequencing throughput relative to traditional Sanger based approaches [10-12]. Second-generation DNA sequencing technology enables more costefficient genomic analysis and, due to their highly parallel
nature, allows for applications in transcriptomics and
epigenomics. Sequencing of normalized cDNA libraries
from several tissues allows for full or partial determination of the transcriptome of a model organism. The transcript information can then be used to develop

microarray platforms, TaqMan assays and antibodies, for
example [13-16].
Analyses of gene expression patterns provide important
information on the role of differential gene expression in
normal biological processes and disease progression.
Global transcriptional changes detected using microarrays has improved our knowledge about virus-host interactions [17-19]. Examination of the mRNA levels in the
host upon infection can help determine infection-specific
transcriptional signatures and allow for distinction
between different pathogens [20]. These functional
genomic analyses may provide valuable knowledge about
which components of the innate immune response the
host activates to clear the pathogens, as well as the strategies that viruses or bacteria use to defeat these [21]. Identification of immune signatures can be used to assess the
strength of the adaptive immune response and to predict
protective immunity after vaccination [22]. To date, this
type of analysis in the ferret is only possible through heterologous species array hybridization, which may introduce false positives due to the evolutionary distance
between the target species and the microarray platform
chosen (reviewed in [23]).
Here we report the use of massive parallel sequencing
using the Roche GS-FLX platform to produce an extensive EST dataset for the ferret. To ensure sequence diversity, we pooled total RNA extracted from blood, liver,
lung, spleen and brain. This RNA pool was reverse-transcribed to cDNA that was normalized prior to sequencing to avoid sequencing of abundantly expressed genes.
The sequence reads were then assembled and annotated
using a newly-developed annotation pipeline. The annotated reads were combined with ferret sequences already
available in the GenBank, and used to create an oligonucleotide-based microarray. Our results contribute
sequence information necessary for the development of
molecular and genomic assays and allow for a better
understanding of the genome of the domestic ferret.

Results
Transcriptome sequencing, annotation and sequence
verification

To obtain a diverse representation of expressed
sequences we pooled total RNA from blood, spleen, liver,
lung and brain from one male and one female ferret. The
RNA was then reverse-transcribed into cDNA. Prior to
sequencing the cDNA was normalized to avoid the
sequencing of only the most abundant transcripts.
We obtained approximately 104 million base pairs distributed in 518112 reads with an average read length of
201 base pairs. The reads were assembled into 54355
sequence contigs and annotated using nucleotide and/or
protein sequence homologies. 33636 contigs were annotated. Initially, 32059 contigs were selected based on the

assembled nucleotide length being at least 200 base pairs
and the annotation e-value of 0.01 or lower (denoted as
Ferret_seq1 here after). Based on the annotations, these
contigs represented a total of 11707 ferret genes. All contigs in the Ferret_seq1 group were used for microarray
probe design. The remaining contigs were megablasted
against the available genomic ferret sequence as well as
the HTGS and the NT databases available at the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). From
these, 10710 contigs with sequence length larger than 100
bp and an e-value smaller than 10-5 were selected to be
included on the ferret-specific microarray (called
Ferret_seq2 here after). The Ferret_seq2 cDNAs represent 4872 additional orthologous gene fragments not
included in the Ferret_seq1 data set as well as 2374 hits to
chromosomal regions.
In an attempt to estimate the number of genes with
multiple contigs covering distinctly different regions, we
performed a reassembly of the Ferret_seq1 and
Ferret_seq2 reads. Using less stringent CAP3 assembly
settings, we identified 5951 contigs that were redundant
and fully encompassed by other larger assemblies of
sequences. These contigs were removed from further
analysis. The remaining contigs were used to identify
genes with multiple contig coverage. 3926 individual
genes from the Ferret_seq1 and Ferret_seq2 are represented by contigs from two or more non-overlapping
regions. The majority of those transcripts are covered by
two individual contigs (15.9%). Approximately 6.9% of the
transcripts from the ferret assemblies have three individual regions represented by sequence and approximately
3% are covered by four different regions (Figure 1A).
The annotated transcripts were also classified according to the three major functional standard Gene Ontology categories: biological process; molecular function;
and cellular component. As expected, a wide range of
functionality was covered. The most frequent biological
processes are shown in figure 1b, and involve nucleic acid
metabolic processes, metabolic processes and regulation
of biological processes. The main molecular functions
were binding, transferase activity, catalytic activity and
transporter activity. Examining the cellular component
annotations, more than 50% of the transcripts were classified as intracellular, approximately 30% were membrane
proteins and only 6% were classified as extracellular transcripts (data not shown).

whole blood derived RNA

Phylogenetic analysis of the ferret globin genes indicated
a closer relation to the human globins than to those of
mouse. Using clustalw alignment of the sequences for the
HBA gene for human, ferret and mouse resulted in higher
alignment scores for M. p. furo versus Human (87 vs. 80

Figure 1 Panel A shows a graphical representation of distribution of the contig-per-transcript coverage for the Ferret_seq1 and
Ferret_seq2 sequence assemblies. The majority of the transcripts were represented by a single contig (66%, in dark blue). 13% of the transcripts had
two individual contigs covering parts of the gene (red). 7.5% of the genes were encompassed by three contigs (green), 4.5% of four contigs (purple),
3% by five contigs (turquoise), 2% by six contigs (orange), 1.3% by seven contigs(light blue) and 1% were covered by eight contigs. The genes covered
by nine or more contigs represent approximately 2% when added together (not shown). Panel B shows the biological process distribution as per GO
ontology analysis of the annotated contigs.

for ferret against mouse). We thus used the human
GlobinClear Â® kit from Ambion to eliminate the globin
interference and achieved an approximately 75% reduction of the globin mRNA (additional file 1). We further
decreased the globin transcripts by complementing the
human globin oligomix of the kit with ferret specific antisense RNA oligos directed towards the HBA and HBB
genes, accomplishing an 85% reduction (additional file 1).
We also hybridized blood-derived RNA with and without
globin clear treatment on the ferret microarray. Hybridization of globin clear treated RNA increased the number
of microarray probes with a normalized log2-transformed
signal above 3 to 22112 probes versus 21438 for the nontreated RNA (data not shown).
Design of the ferret microarray

We used the transcripts generated by the highly parallel
sequencing described above, as well as the already publicly available sequences to create a microarray specific to
M. p. furo. The array was designed utilizing the e-array
portal hosted by Agilent for array design https://earray.chem.agilent.com/earray/. Using the quality scores
assigned for each probe by the Agilent's probe design
algorithm (denoted as BC score, with a range from one high quality to four - low quality), we excluded all probes
with BC scores of three and above. We further eliminated
near-identical probes by blasting all probes against themselves. For probe pairs sharing 59 of 60 base pairs, only
one probe was included on the array. We also included
4210 ferret entries in the EST database and 132 mRNAs
were retrieved from the sequence repositories at NCBI.
The ESTs were blasted against themselves to remove
overlapping EST entries leaving 2270 entries. The mRNA

and the ESTs were then uploaded to the e-array portal,
and again probes with BC scores of three and higher were
excluded from the array. Based on the annotation analysis, one or several different transcripts from 16644 ferret
genes were represented on the array. In addition, the
function of 2374 contigs remains to be elucidated as the
blast hit used to annotate these points towards a genomic
region rather than an expressed gene. The probe
sequences, as well as the annotated source contigs or the
gen bank accessions, are found in additional file 2.
Microarray analysis and TaqMan development

RNA from brain, liver, lung, spleen and blood was analyzed on the array [GEO omnibus acc. GSE19398]. Biological replicates were analyzed as follows: five for liver
and brain tissues, four for lung tissue, and three for blood
and spleen tissues. In addition, technical replicates were
analyzed for samples from the lung, the liver and the
brain. 21350 probes of 43804 had a normalized, scaled
and log2 transformed expression value above 23, which
was subjectively set as the low signal cutoff. The correlation coefficients between the biological replicates were
95% and higher. The technical replicates showed correlation coefficients of 98.5; 98.4 and 97.9% for lung, liver and
brain respectively. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster
analysis and principal component analysis using the
entire data set was used to examine the power of the data
to classify the samples according to their origin. Both
methods showed a clear internal relationship between the
biological and technical replicates from the individual
samples (Figure 2). This is supported further by correct
classification using K-nearest Neighbor classification
analysis, where two samples in each sample group were

selected to train the algorithm to classify the remaining
samples (data not shown).
We then used parametric testing to isolate transcripts
differentially expressed between the tissues. The one-way
ANOVA test (p-value distribution based on the theoretical F-distribution, p-value cut-off of 0.001 and Bonferroni
correction for multiple testing) isolated 8783 probes with
significantly different expression profile between the five
analyzed tissues. These probes were further analyzed
using the Pavlidis Template Matching (PTM) pattern recognition algorithm to isolate transcripts only expressed
by one of the five tissue groups (Figure 3). A number of
these transcripts were compared to the gene atlas expression sets though the BioGPS portal [24]. The expression
profile of a selection of these genes was further verified by
TaqMan analysis.
The array data were also used to identify housekeeping
genes which had minimal variation across the tested tissues. We searched the array data set using the list of
human housekeeping genes generated by Eisenberg and

Levanon, 2003 [24]. The 609 probes on the ferret array
corresponding to these genes were analyzed by ANOVA
to filter out the genes that varied over the analyzed tissues despite being classified as housekeeping genes. More
than 400 transcripts were significantly different (p-value
distribution based on the 1000 permutations, p-value cut
off of 0.001 and Bonferroni correction for multiple testing). The remaining transcripts were clustered using Kmeans clustering to distinguish between the genes that
varied within each group from those that were truly nonvariable between the groups. The latter indicate suitable
housekeeping genes. We identified 41 genes from the
Eisenberg and Levanon list with even expression across
the tested tissues (Figure 4).
To verify a portion of the findings from the microarray
analysis, we examined the gene expression differences
between analyses by quantitative real time PCR. We identified five housekeeping genes with even expression levels
across the samples. We also selected three genes per tissue, with the exception of the spleen, that were highly

Figure 3 Tissue-specific gene expression. Panel A shows a selection of transcripts identified by ANOVA analysis followed by Pavlidis Template
Matching analysis. The genes are clustered according to their expression profile for the analyzed tissues (Pearson correlation, average linkage clustering). The expression value is indicated by a sliding scale, going from black, indicating no expression values, through blue and green to red for the most
highly expressed genes. Panel B show the tissue specific expression verification using qRT-PCR of two of the genes showed in panel A: the ferret albumin gene, Alb, and the ferret pulmonary surfactant-associated protein C, Sftpc. The graphs depict the log2-transformed curves of the relative fluorescence against cycle number during the qRT-PCR amplification. The analysis was done using RNA extracted from liver, lung, blood and brain, using
the Atf4 housekeeping gene as reference. The C(t) threshold line (indicated by a red solid line) is set automatically using the noise band as cut off.

Figure 4 Panel A: Hierarchical clustering analysis showing a set of possible housekeeping genes. These genes were derived from the list of
human housekeeping genes generated by Eisenberg and Levanon et al [24], and further selected using ANOVA analysis. The red and the blue bar
indicate the Nono and the Atf4, shown in greater detail in Panel B. The green bar indicates the expression profile of some of the most commonly used
housekeeping genes. Panel B: Normalized, scaled and log2-transformed probe intensities from Nono and Atf4 across the tissues. On average, there was
a 3.57 fold difference between these two genes. Panel C shows the independent confirmation of the expression differences between the Nono and
Atf4 in the liver. Quantitative RT-PCR determined Atf4 to have a 2.99 times higher expression than Nono, which resembled the array data well.

expressed only in the specific tissue. Primers and TaqMan
probes were designed for each of the transcripts individually. We also designed primers and TaqMan probes
enabling multiplex analysis, allowing for simultaneous
analysis of tissue specific transcripts and housekeeping
genes in a single reaction. Based on the theoretical optimal pairs combinations, the genes encoding apolipoprotein H (Apo-H, liver), albumin (Alb, liver), pulmonary
surfactant-associated protein C (Sftpc, lung), Claudin-18
(Cldn18, lung), Glycine receptor subunit beta (Glrb,
brain), Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1, brain), ataxin 2-binding
protein 1 (Fox1, brain), non-POU domain containing,
octamer-binding protein (Nono, housekeeping gene) and
lastly the activating transcription factor 4 gene (Atf4,
housekeeping gene) were selected for analysis. We started
the analysis by confirming the suitability of the two
housekeeping genes. Both these genes showed even transcription profiles for the tested tissues. We then compared the relative expression differences between these
genes. Based on the log2-transformed microarray data,
the average difference of the fold-changes between the
Nono and the Atf4 transcripts was approximately 3.5.
Confirmatory analysis using qRT-PCR estimates this to
be 3.0, which is in agreement with the microarray results
(Figure 4). We also verified a number of the tissue-specific transcripts detected by the array analysis. The albumin and the pulmonary surfactant-associated protein C
both showed low C(t) values, as expected. However, the
fold-change ratio comparisons between the array data
and qRT-PCR were higher when analyzed by qRT-PCR. A
possible explanation is that the signal intensity of Alb and
Sftpc genes is higher than the upper limit of the dynamic
range of the microarray scanner. We then examined the
Fox1 gene, exclusively expressed in the brain. This gene is
expressed at lower levels than Alb and Sftpc, and the foldchange difference between Fox1 and Atf4 is approximately 1.5 when measured by the array and 0.5 when confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis (data not shown). Lastly, we
tested several common housekeeping genes by real time
PCR using SYBR green. These genes were the 60S ribosomal proteins L32 and L34 (Rpl32 and Rpl34) and the
Sin3A-associated protein, 18 kDa (Sap18). As with the
array analysis, the C(t) values across the tissues were
more variable than the 41 selected by the ANOVA/Kmeans clustering analysis (data not shown).

Discussion
Lack of molecular and immunological tools

Domestic ferrets commonly serve as a model in critical
research areas. The generation of reagents is critical to
probing further into the mechanisms of disease and
infection using this model. The ferret animal model is
highly adapted for studies of influenza virus infection
because the animals develop a number of the symptoms

Page 7 of 11

of influenza that are also seen in humans [4-8]. A severe
course of disease is seen when infecting the ferrets with
highly pathogenic strains such as the H5N1 avian influenza strains [3,25]. Ferrets can be infected by human isolates of influenza virus, while mice, for example, require
adapted strains [9]. Humans and ferrets share the same
molecular structure of sialic acid residues, which serve as
the receptor for influenza attachment to the host cell in
the airway epithelium. This enables the influenza virus to
use the same host cell entry mechanism. In addition to
influenza virus, the ferret model has been shown useful
for studies of SARS CoV infection [1], Canine distemper
virus [26], Campylobacter sp. infection [27] as well as in
Alzheimer's disease research [28].
Despite the broad use of this animal model, ferret
research has been hindered by a lack of available molecular genetic reagents and immunological tools. Current
Entrez records show that 386 mRNAs, 4210 ESTs and 200
protein sequences are available. The ferret genome is not,
as of yet, fully sequenced, however, the genome sequencing project is ongoing and has recently made several
thousand partially sequenced clones available in the
HTGS database. In addition, second generation sequencing technologies have increased the sequencing throughput significantly, and enable full or partial determination
of the transcriptome of a model animal [13,16,29,30]. The
goal for the present study was to utilize these advances to
increase the available transcribed sequences for the ferret
and to use this information to develop a ferret microarray
platform as well as assays for quantitative real time PCR.
Analysis of global transcriptional changes using
microarrays has improved our knowledge about virushost interactions as well as mechanisms by which vaccines induce protection. Functional genomic analyses
provide valuable knowledge about components of hosts'
innate immune responses to pathogens, as well as the
strategies the viruses or bacteria use to defeat these (our
unpublished results and e.g. [17-19]). Systemic
approaches like these can identify innate immune signatures; which may be used to assess the strength of the
adaptive immune response and to predict protective
immunity after vaccination [22].
Microarray analysis of RNA derived from ferret studies
are commonly performed through heterologous array
hybridization using an array developed for another species [19,31]. The sequence divergence between two different species may lead to influences on hybridization
kinetics and the differentiation between actual differential gene expression and those that may be due to
sequence mismatches become indistinguishable. In addition, isoforms and variants of ancestral genes may cross
hybridize and give false positives (reviewed in [23]). The
microarray presented in this work avoids these concerns.

Transcriptome sequencing and ferret assay development

Sequencing of the normalized cDNA library resulted in
more than five hundred thousand sequence reads. These
reads were assembled, filtered and annotated using blast
searches against the non-redundant protein and
sequence databases. We identified more than 15000 individual transcripts, of which approximately 25% are covered by two or more contigs. The correctness of the
annotation process was tested in several ways. We blasted
contigs annotated based on protein sequences against the
nucleotide databases. The annotations were also indirectly confirmed by the tissue-specific expression profiles
detected on the microarray. The tissue-specific gene
expression profiles were compared to the gene expression
of the same genes from mouse and human using the
BioGPS web portal http://biogps.gnf.org. The vast majority of the analyzed genes showed similar transcription
profiles for the ferret genes and the human or murine
transcripts. Common expression profiles suggest that the
annotation of the ferret transcripts on the array is accurate. Although the possibility of altered expression of
genes in the ferret, the human or the mouse exist, it is
likely that the majority of the well-conserved expression
patterns are similar between these species.
The microarray data were used to identify genes evenly
expressed throughout the analyzed tissues. We based this
analysis on a set of previously-identified housekeeping
genes and identified 41 genes through ANOVA and Kmeans clustering analysis. The resulting genes had limited variation across the tissues. None of the most commonly used housekeeping genes, such as the Beta-Actin
(Actb), Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(Gapdh), or the 60S ribosomal protein L32 (Rpl32) were
in this list. Analysis of the coefficient of variation (CV)
among the data points across the tissue samples indicated
several fold-higher CVs for these (i.e., the CV for Actb
and Gapdh was 6.9 and 6.8% of the average log2-transformed expression signal, versus 2.7% for the Atf4 gene).
Careful analysis of housekeeping genes is essential for
both semi-quantitative and quantitative analysis of gene
expression [32]. The 41 genes we present here provide a
good starting point for further investigations into the ferret animal model.

Conclusion
The ferret is an increasingly important animal model,
especially since it is susceptible to infection of influenza
strains that also infect humans. However, the number of
reagents for molecular and immunological analyses is
limited. In this study we have identified close to 16000
partial ferret genes, created a microarray platform for
global transcription analysis, developed quantitative realtime PCR assays and hemoglobin mRNA reduction
methods. The tools and sequences presented here can be

used to aid in the development of ferret-specific antibodies, the discovery of molecular targets of pathogens in the
ferret, infection-specific biomarker discovery and identification of correlates of protection for vaccine tests in this
animal model.

Methods
RNA preparation, library preparation and sequencing

Four six-months-old healthy ferrets were anesthetized
using a mix of ketamine, xylazine and atropine prior to
the final blood draw and euthanasia. Ferret lung, liver,
brain, and spleen tissue were taken and immediately
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated
using TRIzol according to the protocol supplied by the
manufacturer (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Approximately
100 mg of frozen tissue was added to 1 ml of TRIzol and
homogenized using an Omni TH homogenizer with disposable plastic generator probes. Blood samples were collected in PAXgene blood RNA tubes, and total RNA was
extracted using the PAXgene Blood RNA extraction kit
according to the supplier's protocol (PreAnalytiX GmbH,
Switzerland). The quality of the total RNA was analyzed
on the Experion automated gel electrophoresis system
using the RNA StdSens Analysis Kit according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (BioRad, Hercules,
CA).
The total RNA was then prepared for cDNA normalization and library construction by Eurofins MWG Operon
(Huntsville, AL). In essence, cDNA was synthesized from
a pool made from equal amounts of total RNA using a N6
random primer followed by ligation of the 454 adapters A
and B to the 5' and 3' ends of the cDNA. The cDNA was
then amplified by PCR using a proof-reading enzyme and
assayed on a 1.5% agarose gel. The nucleotide fragments
ranged from approximately 100 to 3000 base pairs in size.
The cDNA was then normalized to reduce the likelihood
of sequencing the most abundant transcripts only. Normalization was done by one cycle of denaturation and reassociation of the cDNA. Re-associated double-stranded
cDNA was separated from the remaining single stranded,
normalized cDNA by passing the mixture over a hydroxylapatite column. The normalized cDNA was then amplified by PCR. After eight PCR cycles the normalized and
amplified cDNA was then loaded onto a preparative agarose gel and cDNA ranging from 450 to 650 base pairs
were excised from the gel. The cDNA was eluted from the
gel using the NucleoSpin Extract II kit according to the
manufacturer's protocol (Macherey-Nagel, DÃ¼ren, Germany). The size-fractioned, normalized cDNA fragments
were then subjected to 454 pyro-sequencing using the GS
FLX Technology according to protocols supplied by the
manufacturer (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT). The
sequences are available at the Transcriptome Shotgun

Assembly (TSA) database with accession numbers
EZ456440 - EZ516573.
Sequence assembly and annotation

We implemented an annotation analysis system with five
major components: (1) ESTs assembly system; (2) contig
processing; (3) sequence homology analysis; (4) sequence
annotation and (5) an object-relational storage and
reporting tool. The sequence reads were assembled using
the CAP3 algorithm[33]. The contig processing removed
redundant sequences that were not included in the
assembly process and had a length shorter than 150 bp.
The resulting contigs were annotated by using a sequence
homology analysis pipeline including blastx and blastn
algorithms and local copies of protein and nucleic acid
sequences available from the NCBI-NR, SWISS-PROT,
the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
and the Gene Ontology databases. The results from
BLAST searches for each of these databases were parsed,
stored and integrated in a relational database using different e-value cut-offs parameters. Contig hits with e-values
larger than 0.01 from homology searches in different reference databases were discarded. The summary of the
results was reported for each reference database using
either validated genes or putative functions for predicted
genes.
Globin reduction

Blood contains a large proportion of globin mRNA transcripts, which may decrease the detection sensitivity of
less abundantly transcribed genes on expression microarrays. Utilizing globin reduction methods can increase the
sensitivity of whole blood-derived RNA. We used the
GLOBINclearâ¢ kit to decrease the effect of alpha and beta
globin mRNA expression in total RNA preparations
derived from whole blood (Ambion, Austin, TX). Initially,
sequence comparisons of the globin A, B and E genes
from ferret, human and mouse were done using clustalw
at the EBI server http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/
index.html with default settings. These comparisons
showed that the ferret globin transcripts were more similar to the human orthologs than to those of mouse. We
thus used the human GLOBINclear Â® kit from Ambion to
reduce the globin interference.
The partial ferret transcripts for alpha and beta globins
were uploaded to SciTools antisense design tab found at
the Integrated DNA technology DNA web portal http://
www.idtdna.com. Using the default settings, including
"all phosphorothioate backbone", we selected three antisense oligonucleotides with as similar Tm as possible. A
biotin group was added at the five prime end of each oligonucleotide to enable the attachment of the streptavidin
magnetic bead and subsequent globin removal. The
sequences were as follows: HBA1: 5'Biotin-GCCCTAC-

Page 9 of 11

CCTTTCTTTCGG; HBA2: 5'Biotin-AGTAGGTCTTGGTGGTGGG; HBB: 5'Biotin-CAGCCTTCTCCTCACC
AGT. These antisense oligos were diluted in nucleasefree water and pooled at a concentration of 400 ng/Î¼l.
Five microgram total RNA was then hybridized with 1
Î¼l of the human Capture Oligo mix or 1 Î¼l of the human
Capture Oligo mix and 400 ng (1 Î¼l) of the ferret antisence oligo mix. The remaining procedure was carried
out as specified by the manufacturer (Ambion, Austin,
TX). Five hundred nanograms of the globin-reduced
RNA were then used for cRNA synthesis using the MessageAmp kit according to the manual supplied by the
manufacturer (Ambion, Austin, TX). The cRNA was then
analyzed using the Experion RNA StdSens Analysis Kit
according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer
(BioRad, Hercules, CA), and the raw data was exported
into MS Excel for analysis and visualization (additional
file 1).
Microarray analysis

Five hundred nanograms of high-quality total RNA was
labeled according to the one-color microarray-based
gene expression analysis protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Quantification and
labeling efficiency assessment was done using the NanoDrop 2000 according to supplier's protocol (NanoDrop
Products, Wilmington, DE). Samples with a cRNA synthesis yield below 1.65 Î¼g and a specific activity less than
9.0 pmol Cy3 per Î¼g cRNA were repeated. Labeled cRNA
(1.65 Î¼g) was then fragmented and mixed with the HIRPM hybridization buffer and hybridized for 18-20
hours. The arrays were then washed according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Agilent, Santa Clara,
CA). The arrays were then scanned using a GenePix
4000B scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Each
slide was scanned at 5 Î¼m resolution with two different
PMT gain settings (450 and 480 V). The image files were
then opened in Agilent's Feature Extraction software
using the default Gene Expression protocol and the
GE1_QCM_Feb07 quality control metric set. This software performed gridding, quality control and feature
extraction. The raw data files were then opened in MS
Excel Â® and the signal intensity (gProcessedSignal) was
normalized by dividing all data points with the signal
value of the 75th percentile of all of non-control probes
(gPercentileIntensityProcessedSignal), as suggested by
Agilent. The normalized expression data from each
experiment was then copied into a multi-experiment
spreadsheet and scaled using the average of the new
spreadsheet containing the expression data from all signal
values of the 75th percentile of the non-control probes, in
accordance with the protocol from Agilent. Lastly, the
normalized and scaled data was log2 transformed and

Bruder et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:251
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/251

imported in to the TIGR Multiexperiment Viewer (MeV)
for further statistical analysis.
Statistical analysis

MS Excel was used to calculate the correlation coefficients between the replicate samples based on the normalized, scaled and log2 transformed data. The statistical
analysis of the microarray data was done in MeV. Initially,
we performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the
samples. The clustering analysis was done including all
intensity values for all samples, using Euclidian distance
and average linkage. We also used principal component
analysis and K-nearest neighbor's classification to classify
the samples, using the default setting in MeV. Selection of
tissue specific gene expression was done using one-way
ANOVA analysis using p-value distribution based on the
theoretical F-distribution, p-value cut off of 0.001 and
Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. This analysis
was followed by Pavlidis Template Matching (PTM) pattern, manually setting the thresholds for the specific
expression patterns. The housekeeping genes were
selected using a gene list derived from Eisenberg and
Levanon and identified through ANOVA analysis and Kmeans clustering. From the gene list we selected genes
not significantly changed between the tissue groups. To
sort out genes with large intra tissue variability we subjected the non-significant hits to K-means clustering and
then manually selected the clusters with no or limited
variability between the tissues. These genes were then
hierarchically clustered using Pearson correlation (Figure
4).
TaqMan analysis

For qRT-PCR analysis we started with 2 Î¼g of the total
RNA. The RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using
SuperScript III, First-stand synthesis system for RT-PCR
according to the supplier's protocol (invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). The cDNA (1 Î¼l) was then used in a 20 Î¼l reaction,
including 450 nM of each primer and 200 nM of the
probe. We used TaqMan fast universal PCR Master Mix
for our reactions. The qRT-PCR analysis was carried out
in an Eppendorf RealPlex4S machine at 60Â°C annealing
temperature. The probes were labeled on the 5' end with
either the FAM or HEX fluorophores and with a black
hole quencher 1 molecule on the 3' end. The analysis was
made in the RealPlex software from Eppendorf, letting
the software automatically set the threshold based on the
noise band (Eppendorf North America, Westbury, NY).
The primer and probe sequences were as follows:
