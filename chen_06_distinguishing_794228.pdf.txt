Abstract
Background: HIV can evolve drug resistance rapidly in response to new drug treatments, often
through a combination of multiple mutations [1-3]. It would be useful to develop automated
analyses of HIV sequence polymorphism that are able to predict drug resistance mutations, and to
distinguish different types of functional roles among such mutations, for example, those that
directly cause drug resistance, versus those that play an accessory role. Detecting functional
interactions between mutations is essential for this classification. We have adapted a well-known
measure of evolutionary selection pressure (Ka/Ks) and developed a conditional Ka/Ks approach to
detect important interactions.
Results: We have applied this analysis to four independent HIV protease sequencing datasets:
50,000 clinical samples sequenced by Specialty Laboratories, Inc.; 1800 samples from patients
treated with protease inhibitors; 2600 samples from untreated patients; 400 samples from
untreated African patients. We have identified 428 mutation interactions in Specialty dataset with
statistical significance and we were able to distinguish primary vs. accessory mutations for many
well-studied examples. Amino acid interactions identified by conditional Ka/Ks matched 80 of 92 pair
wise interactions found by a completely independent study of HIV protease (p-value for this match
is significant: 10-70). Furthermore, Ka/Ks selection pressure results were highly reproducible among
these independent datasets, both qualitatively and quantitatively, suggesting that they are detecting
real drug-resistance and viral fitness mutations in the wild HIV-1 population.
Conclusion: Conditional Ka/Ks analysis can detect mutation interactions and distinguish primary
vs. accessory mutations in HIV-1. Ka/Ks analysis of treated vs. untreated patient data can distinguish
drug-resistance vs. viral fitness mutations. Verification of these results would require longitudinal
studies. The result provides a valuable resource for AIDS research and will be available for open
access upon publication at http://www.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/HIV

Background
During the past two decades, researchers and clinicians
have made enormous efforts to identify drug resistance
mutations in HIV-1 protease, a major target of anti-retroviral therapy. Discovery of a new drug resistance mutation
typically requires a combination of clinical research (e.g.
AIDS patients displaying drug resistance), molecular biology (e.g. sequencing), and biochemistry (e.g. obtaining
viral samples and performing phenotypic assays). Over
the last 20 years, many mutations and combinations of
mutations in protease have been reported to play a role in
drug resistance [4,5]. But this discovery process is laborious, expensive, and far from automatic – indeed, it is
research. Meanwhile, HIV is constantly evolving new drug
resistance mutations, often within weeks of introduction
of a new drug [6-8]. Thus, a completely automated
approach for identifying drug resistance mutations would
be valuable [9,10].
Differences in reproductive success (such as the enhanced
survival of a drug-resistant mutant) are reflected in selection pressure, which can be measured directly from
sequence data. For example, Ka/Ks is a well-known metric
of selection pressure for amino acid mutations, measured
relative to the observed frequency of synonymous mutations (which cause no change to protein sequence or function) [11,12]. Ordinarily Ka/Ks values much less than one
are observed, indicating that most amino acid mutations
are deleterious. This is referred to as "negative selection".
By contrast, Ka/Ks values greater than one indicate that
amino acid mutations improve reproductive success (positive selection), a very unusual condition. By screening for
individual amino acid mutations in HIV protease that displayed positive selection, this metric was able to correctly
predict 19 out of 23 known drug resistance mutation sites
in HIV protease [10]. This approach has several advantages: it is completely automatic; it is based on a large and
well-understood body of evolutionary theory; it only
requires raw sequence data to perform this analysis.
However, not all positively selected mutations are created
equal. It would be very useful to be able to distinguish different types of mutations on the basis of their interactions
with other sites. For example, a binding site mutation that
interacts directly with the drug molecule might confer primary drug resistance [13-15]. Alternatively, a mutation
that interacts with another site within HIV protease might
compensate for destabilizing effects of mutations at the
other site [16,17]. Unfortunately, selection pressure met-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/14

rics such as Ka/Ks provide no explicit mechanism for taking such interactions into account.
To address this problem, we have extended the Ka/Ks concept to consider interactions with other sites, by formulating a conditional Ka/Ks that measures the effects of
mutations at one site on the selection pressure for mutations at another site. We have applied it to four completely independent datasets: Specialty: 50,126 HIV-1
positive patient plasma samples sequenced by Specialty
Laboratories, Inc. between October 1999 and October
2003 [10]. This dataset represents a mix of treated and
untreated patient samples from the U.S. Treated: 1797
samples collected by Shafer and colleagues, from U.S.
patients undergoing specific drug treatments [9].
Untreated: 2628 samples collected by Shafer and colleagues specifically from untreated patients [9]. Africa:
399 African HIV-1 subtype C samples downloaded from
Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database [18-20]. These samples predominantly represent untreated patients. These
sequences cover the whole protease region (codons 1 –
99) of HIV-1. The conditional Ka/Ks results are highly
reproducible among these independent datasets. They
reveal complex interactions between amino acid sites, and
distinguish different types of mutations such as primary
drug-resistance mutations vs. accessory mutations.

Methods
HIV-1 sequence data
We filtered all four datasets to exclude contamination by
other HIV-1 subtypes. We compared all of the sequences
in these datasets against HIV-1 subtype reference
sequences from the Los Alamos database by using the program BLAST and assigned each sample to the subtype with
the highest identify. All non-subtype B sequences were
removed from the U.S. datasets and all non-subtype C
sequences were removed from the African dataset. There
might be multiple samples from the same individual in
Specialty dataset. To eliminate the phylogenetic relationships among sequences, we also excluded samples that
have 98% or greater nucleotide sequence similarity to
each other.

Multiple sequence alignment and mutation detection
were performed as previously described [10]. We used the
widely accepted nucleotide reference sequence from the
Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database as the "wildtype" for
HIV-1 subtype B [21,22] and used the nucleotide consensus of all the African subtype C samples as the "wildtype"
for HIV-1 subtype C. In this paper, we considered only
single nucleotide substitutions; all other mutations were
excluded.

Unconditional Ka/Ks measurement for individual codon
positions
Amino acid selection pressure can be calculated for an
individual codon [23,24]; we will refer to this as the
"unconditional Ka/Ks" to distinguish it from the conditional approach presented in the next section. We first
measured the transition and transversion frequencies ft
and fv from the entire dataset, according to

ft =

Nt
N
, fv = v
nt S
nv S

where S is the total number of samples, Nt and Nv are the
number of observed transition and transversion mutations respectively, nt is the number of possible transitions
in the region that was sequenced (simply equal to its
length L in nucleotides), and nv is the number of possible
transversions (equal to 2L). In this calculation (and all
others below) we only counted single nucleotide substitutions; all other mutations were excluded. We performed
the calculation of unconditional Ka/Ks as previously
described [10], as the ratio of Na, the count of samples
with amino acid mutations observed at that codon, over
Ns, the count of samples with synonymous mutations
observed at that codon. This Na/Ns ratio is then normalized by the ratio expected under a random mutation
model (i.e., in the absence of any selection pressure),
according to the following formula:

Na
Ka
Ns
=
na,t ft + na,v fv
KS
ns,t ft + ns,v fv
where na,t is the number of possible transition mutations
in the codon that would change the wildtype amino acid,
ns,t is the number of possible transition mutations in the
codon that are synonymous, and na,v and ns,v are the equivalent numbers for transversions. When the observed ratio
(Na/Ns) is greater than the expected ratio (in the denominator of the expression above), the selection pressure Ka/
Ks is greater than 1 and we say that the codon is under positive selection pressure.
We calculated an LOD confidence score for a codon to be
under positive selection pressure according to the following formula:
N ⎛N⎞
K
N −i
LOD = − log10 p(i ≥ Na | N , q, a = 1) = − log10 ∑ ⎜ ⎟qi ( 1 − q )
i ⎠
Ks
i = Na ⎝

where N is the total number of mutations observed in the
codon, and q is calculated as follows:

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/14

q=

na,t ft + na,v fv
3 ft + 6 fv

Conditional selection pressure analysis
To measure how mutation at one site alters the selection
pressure at another site, we define the "conditional selection pressure" for a site Y in the presence of an amino acid
mutation at another site X as:

NYaXa
⎛ Ka ⎞
NYsXa
=
⎜
⎟
na,t ft + na,v fv
⎝ K s ⎠Y|Xa
ns,t ft + ns,v fv
where NYaXa is the number of samples with an amino acid
mutation at codon Y and an amino acid mutation on
codon X; and NYsXa is the number of samples with a synonymous mutation at codon Y and an amino acid mutation on codon X. We will refer to (Ka/Ks)Y|Xa as the
"conditional Ka/Ks" at Y given an amino acid mutation at
X.
We define the "conditional selection ratio" as the ratio of
the conditional Ka/Ks divided by the selection pressure at
Y measured in the absence of any mutation at X:

⎛ Ka ⎞
⎜
⎟
⎝ K s ⎠Y|Xa

NYa Xa

NYs Xa
⎛ Ka ⎞
=
=
⎜
⎟
NYa Xo
⎝ K s ⎠Y|X ⎛ K a ⎞
⎜
⎟
NYs Xo
⎝ K s ⎠Y|Xo
where NYaXo and NYsXo are the numbers of samples containing either an amino acid mutation or synonymous
mutation at Y and no mutation at codon X.
Confidence scoring for conditional selection pressure
analysis
We screened for codon pairs with conditional Ka/Ks and
conditional selection ratios above 1. To evaluate the statistical significance of apparent positive conditional selection pressure, we defined a LOD score based on the
likelihood of observing at least NYaXa samples with amino
acid mutations at codon Y and X, assuming neutral selection at codon Y:
N ⎛N⎞
⎛K ⎞
N −i
LOD = − log10 p(i ≥ NYaXa | N , q, ⎜ a ⎟
= 1) = − log10 ∑ ⎜ ⎟qi ( i − q )
i ⎠
⎝ K s ⎠Y|Xa
i = NYaXa ⎝

where N = NYaXa + NYsXa; and q as defined above.
To evaluate the statistical significance of the conditional
selection ratio, we used a one-sided Fisher's exact test to
measure the p-value for the null hypothesis that (Ka/

Ks)Y|Xa ≤ (Ka/Ks)Y|Xo. We performed Fisher's exact test on a
2-by-2 contingency table containing the counts NYaXa-1,
NYsXa, NYaXo and NYsXo, using the statistical software package R. We deducted a single count from NYaXa to make the
test stricter against cases with small numbers of counts.
Throughout this study, we used the following criteria for
high confidence positive conditional selection pressure:
(Ka/Ks)Y|X > 1, (Ka/Ks)Y|Xa > 1, LOD > 3, and p < 10-3.
Comparing Ka/Ks values between datasets
To test whether the difference in Ka/Ks value computed
from two datasets D and D' was statistically significant, we
calculated a p-value using a one-sided Fisher's exact test,
using the 2 × 2 contingency table representing the counts
of amino acid mutations and synonymous mutations
from the two datasets: for unconditional Ka/Ks, (Na, Ns,
N'a, N's); for conditional Ka/Ks, (NYaXa, NYsXa, N'YaXa,
N'YsXa). We used a p-value threshold of 0.01.

Results
Detection of selection pressure interactions via conditional
Ka/Ks
To dissect the functional roles of amino acid mutations in
HIV protease, we analyzed the Specialty dataset of 48,387
HIV-positive samples for conditional Ka/Ks relationships.
We screened all possible codon pairs using several criteria:
positive conditional selection pressure (with a statistical
significance test of LOD >3), and a conditional selection
ratio greater than 1 (with a statistical significance test of p

< 10-3). 400 codon pairs showed strong conditional relationships by these criteria (Table 1). These effects ranged
from relatively mild increases (for example, the presence
of an amino acid mutation at position 88 increased the
Ka/Ks value at codon 10 by about 27%) to very large (at
position 30, the Ka/Ks value increased from 0.4 to 71.1
depending on the absence or presence of an amino acid
mutation at codon 88).
These data reveal a basic distinction between two types of
positive selection effects: those that depend on the presence of another amino acid mutation at a specific site, versus those that do not. For example, amino acid mutations
at codon 90 are strongly selected for, regardless of the
presence or absence of a mutation at codon 10 (Fig. 1). By
contrast, codon 10 displayed negative selection in samples with no mutation at 90, but strongly positive selection in samples containing an amino acid mutation at 90.
These data show that mutations at 90 are directly selected
by drug treatment, that mutations at 10 are not favorable
by themselves, but that they become advantageous in
viruses bearing a 90 mutation. These results closely match
previous experimental studies showing that mutations at
90 cause drug resistance, while mutations at 10 have an
accessory effect of compensating for the destabilizing
effect of mutations at 90 [25]. We have observed similar
asymmetric effects at other sites, for example 24/82 (Fig.
1a). In general, primary drug resistance mutations showed
consistent positive selection, whereas accessory mutations
often showed only conditional positive selection, depend-

ent on the presence of a primary drug resistance mutation.
By exposing such asymmetries, the conditional Ka/Ks analysis may be able to predict whether mutations have a primary drug resistance vs. accessory effect. For example,
mutations at position 54 are positively selected, which in
turn induce positive selection for mutations at 89, which
by themselves are unfavorable (Fig. 1b). These data suggest that 89 is an accessory position, whose mutations can
stabilize mutations at 54 (which are known to cause drug
resistance [26]).
Comparison with independent drug treatment studies of
HIV protease
One weakness of the Specialty dataset is that it includes no
information about individual drug treatments. To assess
the significance of our conditional Ka/Ks results, we have
compared them with the independent experimental study
of Wu et al., who identified correlated mutation pairs, i.e.
pairs of codons where mutations co-occurred much more
frequently in patients with specific drug treatments, than
in patients who received no drug treatment [9]. By comparing 1,004 HIV isolates from untreated patients with
1,240 patients from patients treated with one or more
protease inhibitors, Wu et al. identified 92 protease codon
pairs with significant correlated mutations associated with
drug treatment. Our conditional Ka/Ks analysis of the Specialty dataset matched these results closely, identifying 80
of these 92 codon pairs as having positive conditional
selection pressure (LOD>2 and p < 0.01). This result had
strong statistical significance (p-value = 10-70). Thus conditional Ka/Ks appears to robustly detect mutational interactions that are genuinely associated with drug treatment,
even from a dataset (Specialty) lacking any drug treatment
information.
Distinguishing drug-resistance vs. fitness mutations by
comparison of Ka/Ks for treated vs. untreated datasets
We have sought to distinguish mutations that are selected
specifically in response to drug treatment, from fitness
mutations that are positively selected even in the absence
of drug treatment [27]. To do so, we first compared
unconditional Ka/Ks values from the Treated dataset with
those from the Untreated dataset (Table 2). Nine codons
underwent a confident shift from negative selection in
Untreated, to positive selection in Treated. Of these, five
(30, 53, 54, 82, and 90) are known primary drug-resistance mutations, and three (10, 24, 73) are known accessory drug-resistance mutation codons [28]. Thus, this shift
appears to be an accurate predictor of sites involved in
drug-resistance. Intriguingly, the one remaining codon
(74) is not currently known to cause drug-resistance, but
showed confident positive selection both in the Treated
(Ka/Ks = 3.75) and Specialty (Ka/Ks = 5.87) datasets.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/14

A total of fifteen codons were positively selected in both
Treated and Untreated dataset (Table 3; codon 71 has Ka/
Ks value of 1.11 but a LOD = 0.63 in the Untreated dataset). The fact that these mutations were positively selected
even in the absence of drug treatment suggests that they
contribute directly to viral fitness. Of these, five (19, 62,
63, 71 and 77) displayed a statistically significant increase
in Ka/Ks from Untreated to Treated (Table 2). Codons 63,
71 and 77 are known accessory drug-resistance mutations
[28]. The functions of the remaining two codons are
unknown. The significant increase of Ka/Ks value in the
Treated dataset predicts an accessory role in drug-resistance.
Strikingly, all of the known primary drug resistance mutations were observed to be negatively selected in the
Untreated dataset, suggesting that they reduce fitness in
the absence of drug treatment [29-31]. These negative
selection effects were strongest for mutations at codons 66
(Ka/Ks < 0.01), 84(< 0.01), 32 (0.01), 48 (0.02) and 54
(0.03), and weakest at codons 82 (Ka/Ks = 0.46), 53
(0.31), 24(0.33), and 90 (0.25). Thus, in the absence of
continuing drug treatment, these mutations would be
expected to be gradually lost from the evolving viral population due to their greatly reduced fitness [29-31]. By
contrast, while most accessory drug-resistance mutations
were negatively selected in Untreated, some were neutral
(e.g. 71), while others were strongly positively selected
(e.g. 63, 77) even in the absence of drug treatment. This
may explain why mutations at position 63 appear to be
becoming dominant in the HIV population [26,32]
It is interesting to note that at no codon did we ever
observe the pattern of positive selection in Untreated but
negative selection in Treated (Table 3). Thus, drug-treatment appears to preserve positive selection pressure for
fitness mutations that are found in the untreated dataset,
merely adding new positive selection effects for drugresistance.
Although the Treated and Untreated datasets are much
smaller than Specialty, we were able to calculate conditional Ka/Ks values for many sites. Fig. 1e–h shows a comparison of conditional Ka/Ks results from the Treated and
Untreated data for positions 10/90 and 63/90, versus the
results from the Specialty Data (Fig. 1c–d). The Specialty
and Treated results display good qualitative agreement, in
that mutations at 90 (a primary drug-resistance mutation
site) are positively selected regardless of whether an accessory mutation is present at 10 or 63, and each mutation
reproducibly increases selection for the other mutation
[25,31]. By contrast, in the Untreated dataset, mutations
at codon 90 become unfavorable (negative selection pressure), while selection pressure for the accessory mutation
(10 or 63) drops much less.

a Mutations

at codon in Italic are known associated with drug resistance. The nine codons that underwent a confident shift from positive selection
in Treated to negative selection in Untreated are in bold.

Although estimating conditional Ka/Ks accurately from the
Treated dataset is difficult due to insufficient counts, we
identified 274 codon pairs that showed statistically significant increases in conditional Ka/Ks for Treated relative to
the Untreated dataset (Table 4). Of these shifts, eleven
exhibited positive conditional selection pressure in
Treated, but not in Untreated: 10→54, 71→54, 71→82,
63→90 (primary drug-resistance mutation codons);
20→10, 82→10, 71→10, 24→10, 10→63, 36→71,
63→73 (accessory drug-resistance mutation codons). And
two codon pairs (93→63, an accessory drug-resistance
mutation; 12→19, function unknown) are positively
selected in both datasets. It is striking that almost all of
these increases in conditional Ka/Ks involved known drugresistance mutation sites.

Ka/Ks comparison between the specialty and treated
datasets
To evaluate the robustness of our approach, we compared
its results from two independent datasets (Specialty;
Treated), both from U.S. patients who received drug treatment. We first computed unconditional Ka/Ks values from
the two datasets, and compared the results (Fig. 2). These
independent data displayed a significant quantitative
agreement, with a correlation coefficient of 0.887. Out of
the 97 protease codons analyzed, only two significant differences were observed between the datasets. At codon 24,
the Treated data showed mild positive selection (Ka/Ks =
1.59), but the Specialty dataset indicated slightly negative
selection (Ka/Ks = 0.55). At codon 15, the situation was
reversed (Treated Ka/Ks = 0.88; Specialty Ka/Ks = 1.30), but
since both values were very close to neutral (Ka/Ks = 1.0),
the difference was not statistically significant. The almost

exact overlap in positive selection between the two datasets was highly significant (p-value = 10-15.9).

We next compared conditional Ka/Ks values from the two
datasets (Fig. 3). These results display considerably more
variation, but this appears to be due to insufficient counts
in the Treated dataset for accurate estimate of conditional
Ka/Ks values for many codon pairs. Whereas the unconditional Ka/Ks uses the whole dataset to estimate the rates of
amino acid mutations (Ka) and synonymous mutations
(Ks), the conditional Ka/Ks for a mutation Y conditioned
on another mutation X is by definition limited to the
small subset of sequences that contain mutation X. Since
the Treated dataset contains only 1,797 samples, this
drops many sites below the number of samples needed for
accurate estimation of conditional Ka/Ks. To filter the dataset to codon pairs where (Ka/Ks)Y|Xa could be estimated
with some accuracy, we restricted the analysis to cases
where NYaXa + NYsXa > 100. These results showed a strong
match between conditional Ka/Ks values calculated from

Overall, the positively selected Ka/Ks values computed
from the Treated dataset tended to be slightly higher than
those from the Specialty dataset. This is reflected in the
ratios of Ka/Ks values from Treated vs. Specialty data,
whose average (1.37) indicates that the Treated Ka/Ks values were 37% higher than the Specialty values. This is consistent with the fact that the Treated dataset consists
exclusively of patients under drug treatment, whereas the
Specialty dataset contains a mixture of samples from
treated and untreated patients. Such mixing is expected to
reduce the observed selection pressure arising from drugtreatment.

showed. An empty triangle indicated that we were not confident about the conditional selection value in the Treated
dataset. The correlation coefficient of the conditional selection pressures in these two datasets is 0.495.

Again, the positively selected conditional Ka/Ks values
computed from the Treated dataset were slightly higher
than those from the Specialty dataset (by 17.9% on average). This is consistent with the fact that the Specialty
dataset is a mixture of treated and untreated samples,
whereas the Treated dataset was collected exclusively from
treated patients.

for accurate estimation of Ka/Ks values, the two datasets
show strong qualitative agreement (Fig. 4). Of the 97 protease codons analyzed, seventeen codons showed positive
selection (Ka/Ks >1, LOD>2) in at least one of the two
datasets. In twelve cases, both datasets indicated positive
selection (Ka/Ks >1); in four cases, the Untreated data
detected positive selection but the African dataset did not;
and in one case (codon 39), the reverse was observed. This
high level of agreement was statistically significant (Pvalue = 10-3.75). Despite the fact that these data were collected on different continents and represent different HIV1 subtypes (B in Untreated, and C in African), they indicate that fitness mutations are found mostly at the same
positions in the two populations.

Ka/Ks between the untreated and Africa datasets
We computed Ka/Ks values from two untreated datasets:
2,628 HIV-positive samples from U.S. patients who had
received no drug treatment (Untreated); and 399 HIVpositive samples from African patients (predominantly
untreated [18-20]). While the African dataset is too small

Assessing the effects of mixing treated and untreated data
on selection pressure calculations
In principle, the Ka/Ks analysis approach differs from associational studies in that it does not require an untreated
"reference" dataset in order to detect drug-resistance signals, and should even be tolerant of significant levels of

the two independent datasets, with a correlation coefficient of 0.495. None of the codon pairs with positive conditional selection in the Specialty dataset showed negative
selection in the Treated dataset.

Independent HIV-1 datasets yield reproducible positive selection results
Independent HIV-1 datasets yield reproducible positive selection results. Our method identified positively selected
sites (marked with different symbols depending on whether the site is a known drug resistance mutation, accessory mutation,
etc.) in independent analyses of four different datasets: Specialty: 48,387 U.S. patient samples, a mix of treated and untreated
patients; Stanford-Treated: 1797 U.S. patient samples with specific drug treatments; Stanford-Untreated: 2628 U.S.
untreated patient samples; African: 399 African patient samples, HIV-1 subtype C (predominantly untreated patients).

contamination by untreated samples. To test its robustness to such contamination, we deliberately mixed the
Treated and Untreated datasets, and analyzed Ka/Ks from
the mixed data. We tested several mixtures: adding 25%
contamination of Untreated samples (i.e. Nuntreated = 0.25
Ntreated); 50% contamination; and 146% contamination
(i.e. all the available Untreated samples). The 25% and
50% mixtures caused only minor effects on the measured
Ka/Ks values (data not shown). The maximum contamination (146%) caused up to two-fold decreases in positively selected Ka/Ks values (Fig. 5), with shifts averaging of
32.5%. Out of the 24 codons detected to be positively
selected in the Treated dataset, only two became negatively selected in the mixture dataset. These data show that
the Ka/Ks approach is relatively robust even to very high
levels of contamination by untreated samples.

Discussion
Naïve Ka/Ks analysis involves several assumptions that can
undercut the robustness of its results. In particular, the
assumption of a single consensus sequence as the common ancestor of all sequences in the data sample ignores
the possibility of important phylogenetic relationships
among these sequences. Phylogenetic structure in the
dataset thus can cause artifacts in Ka/Ks analysis, and some
methods perform Ka/Ks analysis in the context of an
explicit phylogeny [33]. Linkage disequilibrium between
sites can also cause artifacts in conditional Ka/Ks analysis,
by creating correlations between sites that are purely historical, and not due to functional interaction [34,35].
These problems are likely to be most severe in genomes
with a low mutation rate and low recombination rate, and

pressure mixing Treated and Untreated data on selection
Effects of calculation
Effects of mixing Treated and Untreated data on
selection pressure calculation. We have mixed the
Treated (1797 samples) with the Untreated (2628 samples)
to assess the effects of a mixed data on selection pressure
analysis. This mixing caused up to two-fold decreases in positively selected Ka/Ks values (compared with the Treated
dataset), with shifts averaging of 32.7%. Out of the 24 positively selected codons in the Treated dataset, only two
became negatively selected in the Mixture dataset. Ka/Ks values with a LOD < 2 in the Mixture dataset were plotted as

less severe in genomes with very high mutation and
recombination rates, such as HIV.
To assess these problems, we have used HIV mutation
data to test the utility and robustness of conditional Ka/Ks
analysis, by comparison with known functional interactions involved in drug resistance, and comparison of the
Ka/Ks results for multiple independent datasets. Several
lines of evidence indicate that, at least for HIV protease,
conditional Ka/Ks analysis provides robust detection of
real functional interactions that are not artifacts: 1) Ka/Ks
identification of sites with strong positive selection correctly identified known drug resistance mutations in HIV
protease (p-value = 10-3.3; [10]); 2) Ka/Ks identification of
mutations with strong positive selection matched independent experimental phenotypic assays [10,36]; 3) conditional Ka/Ks identification of pairs of sites with strongly
positive conditional selection ratios ((Ka/Ks)Y|X >>1)
strongly matched independent experimental studies iden-

tifying pairs of mutations that are correlated in treated vs.
untreated patient datasets [9]; 4) detailed functional predictions from conditional Ka/Ks (such as distinguishing
primary vs. accessory drug resistance mutations) matched
well-known examples in HIV protease where such
detailed functional information is available; 5) conditional Ka/Ks values computed from independent datasets
(Specialty vs. Stanford-Treated) yielded highly similar
results, indicating that these values are not artifacts, but
broadly reproducible characteristics of HIV evolution in
the wild population; 6) the strong positive selection patterns identified by conditional Ka/Ks in treated patients
(Specialty; Stanford-Treated) vanished in the untreated
patient dataset (Stanford-Untreated), indicating that these
Ka/Ks patterns genuinely reflect selection pressure associated with drug treatment. Considered as a whole, all of
these assessments suggest that conditional Ka/Ks robustly
identifies genuine functional selection pressure in HIV
protease, not artifacts, and thus may also be useful in
other genes with similar characteristics, such as other HIV
genes, or other rapidly-evolving viruses. However, it is
likely that a more sophisticated approach, incorporating
phylogenetic structure, will be required for other types of
problems.
The high level of reproducibility of Ka/Ks results across
four independent datasets in this study (Fig. 4) merits further consideration. These datasets were collected entirely
independently, and come from diverse sources [9,10,1820]. The quantitative agreement between Ka/Ks values
obtained from these datasets is surprisingly consistent
considering that the input data were collected by different
investigators, from different patient groups, over different
time periods, under differing drug treatment regimens
(and in the case of the Specialty dataset, no treatment
information available whatsoever), and even from different continents and HIV-1 subtypes. Even the weakest level
of agreement between datasets (Untreated vs. Africa, by
far the smallest dataset) was significant (p-value = 10-3.75).
Moreover, comparison of the Ka/Ks results versus known
drug-resistance mutations demonstrates that this
approach predicts true drug-resistance mutation codons
with a high level of accuracy (13 drug-resistance mutation
codons in Ka/Ks analysis, and 19 in the conditional Ka/Ks
analysis). These results also show that comparison of Ka/
Ks values between treated and untreated datasets is effective at distinguishing primary and accessory drug-resistance mutations (only observed in the treated dataset)
from viral fitness mutations (observed in the untreated
dataset). This suggests that this approach could be applied
successfully to more specific dataset comparisons (such as
two different drug treatments).
These four datasets also suggest that viral fitness mutations in HIV protease are surprisingly consistent through-

out HIV-1 populations. In general, mutations that were
positively selected in untreated samples (i.e. the
Untreated and African datasets) were also observed to be
positively selected in treated samples (i.e. in both the Specialty and Treated datasets). To a first approximation,
these mutations seem to represent a uniform background
of positive selection pressures that are consistently
observed in any set of samples we have analyzed. Furthermore, these "viral fitness" mutation codons matched
strongly between the Africa and Untreated datasets, indicating that these fitness pressures are even consistent
across different HIV-1 subtypes (B in Untreated vs. C in
Africa) [37,38].
These comparisons suggest that it may be useful to classify
mutations according to their selection pressure values in
treated vs. untreated patient populations. For example,
whereas mutations that are positively selected even in
untreated samples may be classed as improving viral fitness [37], mutations that are positively selected in treated
samples but not untreated samples are likely to be drugresistance mutations [13-15]. It is also interesting to classify mutations according to whether their positive selection effects are conditional or unconditional. A mutation
that is positively selected by drug treatment, with no conditional dependence on any other mutation, evidently
makes a primary (i.e. direct) contribution to drug-resistance [13-15]. By contrast, a mutation that is positively
selected by drug treatment only in the presence of a primary mutation, evidently does not make a direct contribution to drug-resistance, but rather a secondary (or
"accessory") contribution mediated by the primary mutation [16,17]. Finally, a mutation that compensates for a
deleterious fitness effect caused by a primary drug-resistance mutation can also be distinguished by Ka/Ks analysis
[31]. Such a mutation should not exhibit unconditional
positive selection in either untreated or treated samples,
but should show positive conditional selection (only in the
presence of the primary mutation) in both types of samples.
How much "mixing" of sample types can this approach
tolerate? We have tested the effects of deliberately mixing
treated and untreated datasets upon positive selection
mapping by Ka/Ks. These data show that Ka/Ks can robustly
detect drug resistance mutations even when the level of
mixing equals or even exceeds 100%. Such mixing
reduced Ka/Ks estimates somewhat, but qualitatively the
results were robust. Thus, not only can Ka/Ks detect drug
resistance mutations in a single dataset (with no requirement for a reference dataset of untreated samples), it can
do so even when the primary dataset is contaminated with
a large fraction of untreated samples, or samples with different treatments. This can be very useful in situations

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/14

where treatment information is incomplete or unavailable.
Since different amino acid mutations can have different
functional effects [36], an obvious extension of this analysis to consider the conditional selection pressure effects
of individual amino acid mutations, rather than treating
all amino acid mutations at one site as equivalent, as was
done in this analysis. Such an extension would yield
detailed information about the amino acid interactions
between two codon sites [10].
Conditional Ka/Ks represents a slight extension of existing
work on co-evolution of amino acid residues in protein
sequences. One well-established approach to this problem is the use of correlation analysis to look for correlations between amino acid residues in a set of related
sequences [17,39-44]. For example, by analyzing mutation correlation in an alignment of 266 non-redundant
SH3 domain sequences, Larson et al. were able to predict
residue-residue contacts in the structure of the SH3
domain [40]. Such correlated mutation analysis tests for
non-additive effects of a pair of mutations on reproductive fitness, such as epistasis [45] or compensation [43].
One important question not addressed by correlation
analysis is whether an interaction between a pair of mutations is symmetric or asymmetric; that is, whether the
influence of one mutation on the fitness effect of the second mutation is the same as the influence of the second
mutation upon the fitness effect of the first. Since the definition of correlation is inherently symmetric (i.e. the correlation coefficient ρ(x,y) = ρ(y,x) is invariant to exchange
of x and y), it does not answer this question. Conditional
Ka/Ks combines the benefits of correlation analysis
(detection of interactions between sites) with the benefits
of standard Ka/Ks (a measurement of functional selection
pressure). Moreover, this method can distinguish symmetric
vs.
asymmetric
functional
interactions.
We emphasize that in the simple form presented in this
paper, conditional Ka/Ks is probably not applicable in
datasets with a low mutation rate or strong linkage disequilibrium. If the number of mutation observations at a
site is small, results will not be statistically significant.
Worse, if individual observations of a mutation are not
independent mutation events, but instead arose by common descent from a single ancestral mutation event, the
results will be skewed by such "double-counting" bias
within the data. In sequence datasets with clear phylogenetic structure, it will be essential to compute conditional
Ka/Ks for specific branches of the phylogenetic tree, as has
been done for standard Ka/Ks calculations [33,46]. This
improved approach control for departures from conditional independence in the data sample, by explicitly analyzing the conditional dependence structure (i.e. the

phylogenetic tree). Thus conditional Ka/Ks need not be
limited to cases that fit a "star topology", but can be generalized to work with phylogenetic trees.

Conclusion
Conditional Ka/Ks analysis can detect mutation interactions between different sites. The analysis results also
reveal important effects on fitness that are asymmetric and
are very useful to predict primary vs. accessory drug resistant mutations. Comparison of Ka/Ks values between
treated and untreated datasets is effective at distinguishing
drug-resistance associated mutations from viral fitness
mutations. Analysis results from four completely independent datasets are highly consistent both qualitatively
and quantitatively. These results can be very helpful to
understand the functional roles of different mutations in
the development of drug resistance.

Second review following revision
The manuscript has been greatly improved by addressing
the larger specific issues raised in the initial review and
also by improving the presentation of the results and clarity of the writing. Below I've summarized some of the specific improvements and do raise two additional points –
the second of these points should definitely be addressed
because it will be raised by others knowledgeable about
the specific patterns of mutations observed in drug-resistant isolates.

Authors' contributions
L. Chen carried out the sequence alignment, mutation
detection, selection pressure and conditional selection
pressure analysis. C. Lee proposed the conditional Ka/Ks
metric, participated in the design of the study, and drafted
the manuscript.

1. Phylogenetic relationships among the sequences. The
manuscript has been improved by discussing the relevance of this issue and by adopting a heuristic approach –
excluding samples with >98% sequence identity. The
authors should add to the methods that this step was
taken.

Second review following revisions:
This is a very interesting study. The author developed a
conditional Ka/Ks test and applied it to large amounts of
HIV sequence data to detect drug resistance mutation and
fitness mutations. Since the MS reads well and since I am
traveling, I have not read it carefully, but I suppose there
are no serious problems.
My main suggestion is that the authors should explain in
more detail the methodological parts, so that readers can
understand them better.
Minor comments:
Give an explanation of Ka and Ks in the Introduction.
Explain the definition of q on page 7.

2. Inherent variability of HIV-1 sequences. The authors
have explained in more detail how conditional Ka/Ks was
determined. Although their approach may remain controversial, it is certainly novel and worthy of publication and
broader discussion.
Author response
As suggested by the reviewer, we have added a sentence in the
Method Section to explain that we have excluded samples with
>98% sequence identity.

3. Availability of the data. Although this may be partly
beyond their control, the authors' attempts to make the
data available – ideally the complete nucleotide sequence
– is laudatory.
Author response
All the sequence data and analysis results will be available to
open access upon the publication of this manuscript at: http://
www.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/HIV

4. Presentation of the results. This has been improved and
the Additional File is also useful.

In many places "amino acid mutations" should be
"amino acid substitutions or replacements".

Several additional comments:

Author response
We have briefly introduced Ka/Ks in the Background and there
is detailed description of how to calculate Ka/Ks in the Method.

The authors state in the methods that "we only counted
single nucleotide substations". Would this influence their
ability to detect positions at which the mutations are 2-bp

Page 13 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:14

mutations. If so this should be stated. This would not
influence the protease because, as far as I am aware, the 2bp changes I47A, I54A, V82S, I84A/C are each uncommon mutations at positions at which 1-bp changes also
cause resistance (I47V, I54V, V82A, I84V). But it would
influence a similar analysis on RT as T215Y and T215F are
each 2-bp changes and are the only drug-resistance mutations at these positions.
I believe the authors need to add further explanation as to
the implications of conditional Ka/Ks because of the following: In table 1, several of the Codon X's are actually
known to follow the Codon Y. Therefore the statistical
dependence of Y on X, does not necessarily mean that Y
follows X. The most obvious example of this is the relationship between position 30 and 88. There is only one
mutation at position 30 (D30N). There are several at position 88 (N88D >> N88S >>> N88T/G). N88S occurs completely independent of D30N but is much less common
than N88D. However, N88D always follows and never
precedes D30N. Therefore there are two paths to resistance involving these mutations: D30N followed by
D30N+N88D and N88S alone. I believe that this is also
the case for codons 73 and 90 (73 nearly always follows
90) and 24 and 82 (24 nearly always follows 82).
Author response
Only a very small fraction of the mutations involve multiple
nucleotide substitutions in a codon (about 10%). They are
excluded from this analysis because their evolution patterns are
different from single nucleotide polymorphism (ex. It takes two
steps for ctc mutating to gcc, which could be either of these two
processes: 1. ctc→gtc→gcc; 2. tct→ccc→gcc)

Second review following revisions:
This manuscript presents an analysis of HIV protease
sequencing datasets. Comparing synonymous and nonsynonymous sequence changes, the authors detected sites
under putative positive selection possibly in response to
drug treatment.
The manuscript is based on the earlier work by the same
authors (J Virol. 2004 Apr;78(7):3722–32.) and introduces a new concept of conditional positive selection. The
authors argue that selection in some sites is conditional
on amino acid residue at a different site.
This is an interesting work and the manuscript has
improved upon revision. The revised manuscript includes
discussion of the existing literature on co-evolution of

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/14

amino acid residues. However, I would still like to make a
few comments, some of them being critical.
1) A few comments on the method
a) The authors make a series of simplifications including
assumptions of star-like phylogeny and absence of multiple substitutions in individual codons. Therefore, the
method assumes that all sequences are descendants of a
single sequence and the estimation of Ka and Ks is done
by simple counting. I agree with the authors that currently
available methods are not applicable to the dataset of
~50,000 sequences. Thus, the authors have no other
choice rather than to rely on simpler computationally efficient methods and making these assumptions is a necessity. The authors also point that the number of codons
with multiple substitutions is not expected to be high.
However, if the above assumptions are not valid (and it is
not clear why the phylogeny is expected to be star-like),
the results of the analysis have to be received with caution.
Inference of positive selection can be erroneous. Analysis
of statistical significance which relies on the binomial distribution and application of the Fisher exact test are not
justified if these assumptions are not satisfied.
Author response
We have identified all mutations (both single nucleotide polymorphisms and multiple nucleotide polymorphisms) in this
dataset. The results show that only a very small fraction of the
mutations involve multiple substitutions in a codon (about
10%). They are excluded from this analysis because their evolution patterns are different from single nucleotide polymorphism.

HIV has extremely high mutation rate and high recombination
rate. And it is under strong selection pressure, especially when
the patient is under drug treatment. These same factors tend to
make HIV evolution within a specific subtype follow the star
topology model.
b) It is my understanding that frequencies of transition
and transversion rates were estimated using both synonymous and non-synonymous changes. It may be better to
use synonymous changes only.
Author response
As suggested by the reviewer, we have estimated the transition
and transversion rates only using synonymous changes (Ft/Fv=
23.75). This does not alter the results of selection pressure and
conditional selection pressure analysis much. For the purposes
of this paper (selection pressure analysis) we prefer to use the
more conservative assumption of measuring Ft/Fvfrom all
nucleotides (Ft/Fv = 8.90), since this matches what has been
published previously (Wilson, J. W., J Clin Microbiol, 2000).

c) Testing all pairs of codons creates an obvious multiple
test problem. The manuscript would probably benefit
from the discussion on how the rate of false-positive predictions is controlled given this multiple test problem.

4.

2) It is of interest whether amino acid residue pairs which
display conditional selection located close to each other
in protein structure. The structural analysis can serve as a
confirmation of the conclusions made by the authors.
However, I agree with the authors's response that this
should be a subject of a separate study.

6.

3) Most importantly, I do not find the explanation of the
observed "conditional selection" satisfactory. The authors
argue that mutations with significant "conditional Ka/Ks
values" are not directly involved in the drug resistance and
play accessory role. The first mutation which is directly
involved in the drug resistance is destabilizing (in other
words, is expected to be deleterious in the absence of the
drug treatment) and the second mutation is needed to
compensate the destabilizing effect of the first mutation.
Although, this is certainly a possibility, it is feasible to
imagine many other scenarios. For example, is it possible
that the first mutation enables the effect of the second
mutation on the drug response, i.e. the first mutation is
not destabilizing but the second mutation would not have
an effect on drug resistance without the first mutation?
Alternatively, is it possible that the first mutation is not
destabilizing, whereas the second mutation would be
destabilizing (and deleterious) in the absence of the first
mutation (Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility)? In this
case also the second mutation may be directly involved in
drug resistance. Importantly, the latter scenarios do not
involve initial increase in frequency of a destabilizing variant.
