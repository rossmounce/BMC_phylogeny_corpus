Abstract
Background: Aminoglycoside ototoxicity is one of the common health problems. Mitochondrial 12S rRNA
mutations are one of the important causes of aminoglycoside ototoxicity. However, the incidences of 12S rRNA
mutations associated with aminoglycoside ototoxicity are less known.
Methods: A total of 440 Chinese pediatric hearing-impaired subjects were recruited from two otology clinics in the
Ningbo and Wenzhou cities of Zhejiang Province, China. These subjects underwent clinical, genetic evaluation and
molecular analysis of mitochondrial 12S rRNA. Resultant mtDNA variants were evaluated by structural and
phylogenetic analysis.
Results: The study samples consisted of 227 males and 213 females. The age of all participants ranged from
1 years old to 18 years, with the median age of 9 years. Ninety-eight subjects (58 males and 40 females) had a
history of exposure to aminoglycosides, accounting for 22.3% cases of hearing loss in this cohort. Molecular
analysis of 12S rRNA gene identified 41 (39 known and 2 novel) variants. The incidences of the known deafnessassociated 1555A > G, 1494C > T and 1095T > C mutations were 7.5%, 0.45% and 0.91% in this entire hearingimpaired subjects, respectively, and 21.4%, 2% and 2% among 98 subjects with aminoglycoside ototoxicity,
respectively. The structural and phylogenetic evaluations showed that a novel 747A > G variant and known 839A >
G, 1027A > G, 1310C > T and 1413T > C variants conferred increased sensitivity to aminoglycosides or
nonsyndromic deafness as they were absent in 449 Chinese controls and localized at highly conserved nucleotides
of this rRNA. However, other variants were polymorphisms. Of 44 subjects carrying one of definite or putative
deafness-related 12S rRNA variants, only one subject carrying the 1413T > C variant harbored the 235DelC/
299DelAT mutations in the GJB2 gene, while none of mutations in GJB2 gene was detected in other 43 subjects.
Conclusions: Mutations in mitochondrial 12S rRNA accounted for ~30% cases of aminoglycoside-induced deafness
in this cohort. Our data strongly support the idea that the mitochondrial 12S rRNA is the hot spot for mutations
associated with aminoglycoside ototoxicity. These data have been providing valuable information and technology
to predict which individuals are at risk for ototoxicity, to improve the safety of aminoglycoside antibiotic therapy,
and eventually to decrease the incidence of deafness.

Background
Aminoglycosides, such as gentamicin and tobramycin,
are of great clinical importance for the treatment of bacterial infections. The use of these drugs can frequently
lead to toxicity, which involves the renal, auditory and
vestibular systems [1,2]. The renal impairment is usually
reversible, whereas the auditory and vestibular ototoxicity is usually irreversible. In familial cases of ototoxicity, aminoglycoside hypersensitivity is often maternally
transmitted, suggesting that mutation(s) in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is one of molecular bases for this
susceptibility [1,2]. As mitochondrial ribosomes share
more similarities to bacterial ribosomes than do cytosolic counterparts, the human mitochondrial 12 rRNA was
proposed to be the primary targeting site for aminoglycosides [3,4]. The mutational analysis of mitochondrial
genome in several Chinese and Arab-Israeli families
with maternally transmitted aminoglycoside ototoxicity
or/and nonsyndromic deafness led to the landmark discovery of the 12S rRNA 1555A > G mutation in 1993
[3]. Subsequently, the 1555A > G mutation has been
found to be responsible for both aminoglycosideinduced and nonsyndromic hearing loss in many
families worldwide [4-10]. On the other hand, the 12S
rRNA 1494C > T mutation has been associated with
both aminoglycoside-induced and nonsyndromic hearing
loss only in some Chinese and Spanish families [11-13].
The 1555A > G and 1494C > T mutations are located
at the highly conserved A-site of 12S rRNA [4,11]. The
A1555 and C1494 (equivalent to positions 1491 and 1409
of Escherichia coli 16S rRNA, respectively) are in apposition to each other but do not form a base-pair. The
1555A > G or 1494C > T mutation creates a new G-C or
A-U pair base-pair, thereby extending the adjacent stem
by one nucleotide and making the secondary structure of
mitochondrial 12S rRNA more closely resemble the corresponding region of E. coli 16S rRNA and altering binding properties of aminoglycosides such as paromomycin,
neomycin, gentamicin, and kanamycin at the A-site of
12S rRNA [14]. Thus, the administration of aminoglycosides can induce or worsen hearing loss in these subjects
carrying the 1555A > G or 1494C > T mutation. In the
absence of aminoglycosides, matrilineal relatives within
and among families carrying the 1555A > G or 1494C >
T mutation exhibited a considerable phenotypic variation
with respect to severity and age-of-onset and penetrance
of hearing loss [4-13]. Therefore, additional modifier factors such as aminoglycosides, nuclear and mitochondrial
genetic modifiers contributed to the phenotypic variability of these mtDNA mutations [11,15-18].
However, the incidences of the 1555A > G and 1494C
> T mutations were only reported in the some cohorts
of hearing-impaired subjects [3,19-24]. As these

Page 2 of 11

mutations are only responsible for a portion of patients
with hearing loss, it is anticipated that additional mutations causing hearing loss can be found in the same
gene. In the present investigation, we carried out a systematic and extended mutational screening of 12S
rRNA gene in a cohort of 440 hearing-impaired Han
Chinese pediatric subjects from two otology clinics at
Ningbo and Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. Mutational analysis of 12S rRNA gene in these subjects identified the known 1555A > G and 1494C > T mutations
as well as 39 other variants. Those variants have been
further evaluated by phylogenetic analysis, structurefunction relation and allelic frequency of these variants
in the 449 Han Chinese controls from the same region.
To examine if the GJB2 gene contributed to a deafness
phenotype, we performed the mutational screening of
GJB2 gene in 39 subjects carrying the known deafnessassociated 12S rRNA mutations and 5 subjects carrying
one of 5 putative 12S rRNA mutations.

Methods
Subjects and audiological examinations

A total of 440 unrelated hearing-impaired Chinese subjects, who were younger than 18 years old two otology
clinics from Zhejiang Province, were enrolled in this
study under an institutional review board-approved protocol of informed consent at the Cincinnati Children’s
Hospital Medical Center Institutional Review Board and
Ethics Committee of Wenzhou Medical College, China.
A comprehensive history and physical examination for
these participating subjects were performed to identify
any syndromic findings, the history of the use of aminoglycosides, genetic factors related to the hearing impairment. An age-appropriate audiological examination was
performed and this examination included pure-tone
audiometry (PTA) and/or auditory brainstem response
(ABR), immittance testing and Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE). The PTA was calculated
from the average of the audiometric thresholds at 500,
1000, 2000, 4000 and 8000 Hz. The severity of hearing
impairment was classified into five grades: normal <26
Decibel (dB); mild = 26-40 dB; moderate = 41-70 dB;
severe = 71-90 dB; and profound >90 dB. The 449 control DNA used for screening for the presence of
mtDNA variants were obtained from a panel of unaffected Han Chinese subjects from the same region.
Mutational analysis of mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene

Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood of participants using Puregene DNA Isolation Kits (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA). Subject’s DNA
fragments spanning the 12S rRNA gene were amplified
by PCR using oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding to

Shen et al. Journal of Translational Medicine 2011, 9:4
http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/9/1/4

positions 618-635 and 1988-2007 [25]. Each fragment
was purified and subsequently analyzed by direct
sequencing in an ABI 3700 automated DNA sequencer
using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) sequencing reaction
kit. The resultant sequence data were compared with
the updated consensus Cambridge sequence (GenBank
accession number: NC_012920) [26]. The homoplasmy
of the 1555A > G and 1494C > T mutations in these
subjects were determined as detailed previously [7,11].
The frequency of variants in the 12S rRNA gene in 449
Chinese control subjects was determined by direct
sequencing of PCR products as described above.
Mutational analysis of GJB2 gene

The DNA fragments spanning the entire coding region
of GJB2 gene were amplified by PCR using the following
oligodeoxynucleotides: forward-5’TATGACACTCCCCAGCACAG3’ and reverse-5’GGGCAATGCTTAAACTGGC3’. PCR amplification and subsequent sequencing
analysis were performed as detailed elsewhere [10]. The
results were compared with the wild type GJB2
sequence (Version 1, GenBank accession number:
M86849) to identify the mutations.
Structural analysis

The published secondary structures for the 12S rRNA
[27,28] were used to define the stem and loop structure.
The secondary structure of human mitochondrial 12S
rRNA was predicted by using the RnaViz program [29].
Phylogenetic analysis

A total of 14 primate mitochondrial 12S rRNA
sequences (Genbank), as shown in Table 1, were used in

species from the list of 14 different primates that have
the wild-type nucleotide at that position.

Results
Study samples

The study samples consisted of 227 males and 213
females. The age of all participants ranged from 1 years
old to 18 years, with the median age of 9 years. All participants were Han Chinese recruited from ENT clinics
at Ningbo and Wenzhou Cities of Zhejiang Province,
China. Based on a clinician review of the medical
record, 98 subjects (58 males and 40 females) had a history of exposure to aminoglycosides including gentamicin, streptomycin and kanamycin, accounting for 22.3%
cases of hearing loss in this cohort. These subjects, due
to infections or other illness, received a conventional
daily dosage of aminoglycosides (3 5 mg/kg/dose every
8 h for gentamicin or 15 25 mg/kg/dose every 12 h for
streptomycin, 15 mg/kg/dose every 8 h for kanamycin)
at younger than 10 years old. Hearing impairment
occurred from 3 days to three months after the administration of drugs. Audiological evaluation showed that 22
subjects had severe hearing loss and 76 individuals
exhibited profound hearing loss. Furthermore, there was
the wide range of severity of hearing loss in 342 affected
subjects who did not have a history of exposure to aminoglycosides: 149 subjects exhibited profound hearing
loss, 167 subjects had severe hearing loss and 26 individuals suffered from moderate hearing loss. The onset of
the hearing loss ranged from congenital to 10 years old.

Mutational analysis of mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene

Fragments spanning 12S rRNA gene were PCR-amplified
from genomic DNA of 440 hearing-impaired Chinese
subjects and each fragment was purified and subsequently analyzed by DNA sequencing. Comparison of
the resultant sequence with the Cambridge consensus
sequence [26] identified 41 nucleotide changes in the 12S
rRNA gene as shown in Table 2. All the nucleotide
changes were verified by sequence analysis of both
strands and appeared to be homoplasmy. Of these, 2 subjects with profound hearing loss carried the 1494C > T
mutation. Both subjects carrying the 1494C > T mutation
had a history of exposure to aminoglycosides. These
translate to a frequency of ~0.45% for the 1494C > T
mutation in this Chinese pediatric deafness population.

Among these, 33 hearing-impaired subjects carrying
the 1555A > G mutation were composed of 21 subjects
who had a history of exposure to aminoglycosides and 12
individuals who did not receive aminoglycoside treatment. These translate to a frequency of ~7.5% for the

1555A > G mutation in this entire Chinese pediatric
deafness population, and approximately 21.4% in cases of
aminoglycoside ototoxicity in this Chinese pediatric
population. Furthermore, 4 subjects harbored the known
deafness-associated 1095T > C mutation [30,31] and 11

Shen et al. Journal of Translational Medicine 2011, 9:4

subjects carried the putative deafness-associated mutations at position of 961 (961insC and 961T > C)
[7,21,32,33], respectively.
In addition to the mutations mentioned above, there
were 34 known and 2 novel variants in the 12S rRNA
gene [34]. These variants were first evaluated by examining the allelic frequency in 449 Han Chinese control
population. Nineteen out of 41 variants were absent in
this Chinese control population. Of other 22 variants,
the frequencies of 8 variants were <1% in 449 Chinese
controls, while the allelic frequency of other 14 variants
was >1% in this control population. Furthermore, we
used the secondary structure of 12S rRNA [29,35] to
localize each variant with either a stem or a loop and to
analyze if the base changes within stems alter classic
Watson-Crick (WC) base pair [29,35]. As shown in
Figure 1, 23 variants were located at the loops, while 18
variants occurred in the stems of this rRNA. As shown
in Table 2 and Figure 1, 5 variants 1393G > A, 1413T >
C, 1494C > T, 1503G > A and 1555A > G created a
putative base-pairing(s), while 12 variants 663A > G,
681T > C, 709G > A, 747A > G, 839A > G, 929A > T,
951G > A, 980T > C, 990T > C, 1095T > C, 1310C > T
and 1382A > C abolished a putative base pairing(s).
This suggested that the nucleotide variants were more
frequent in loops than in stems. In addition, phylogenetic analysis was performed by comparing the
human 12S rRNA nucleotide variants with other 13
primates. As shown in Table 2, conservation index
(CI) among the variants ranged from 21.4% (1009C >
T variant) to 100% (752C > T and 747A > G variants).
In particular, CI of 18 variants including 1555A > G
and 1494C > T mutations were >78%, CI of other 13
variants was between 78% and 50% and CI for the
remaining variants was <50%. In addition to the
1555A > G and 1494C > T mutations, the novel 747A
> G variant and the known 839A > G, 1027A > G,
1310C > T and 1413T > C variants [22,34], which are
absent in the 449 Chinese controls and whose CIs
were >78%, were the putative deafness-associated variants. On the other hand, other variants such as 663A
> G, 681T > C, 735A > G, 752C > T, 827A > G,
1107T > C and 1382A > C, whose CIs were >78%,
which were present in the controls, appeared to be
the polymorphisms.
Clinical characterization of 39 hearing-impaired Chinese
subjects carrying one of known or 12S rRNA mutations

Comprehensive medical evaluations of 33 probands carrying the 1555A > G mutation, two subjects harboring
the 1494C > T mutation and four individuals carrying
the 1095T > C mutation showed no other clinical
abnormalities, including diabetes, muscular diseases,
visual loss and neurological disorders. As shown in

Page 5 of 11

Table 3, audiological assessments of 33 subjects carrying
the 1555A > G mutation showed that 15, 3 and 3 subjects with the aminoglycoside treatments exhibited profound, severe or moderate hearing loss, respectively.
Moreover, 12 individuals, who did not have a history of
exposure to aminoglycosides, exhibited a variety of
severity and age-of-onset of hearing impairment. The
age-of-onset of hearing loss in these subjects ranged
from infant to 18 years, with an average of 6 years.
Audiometric studies showed that 3 individuals suffered
from profound hearing impairment, 5 subjects exhibited
severe hearing impairment, 2 probands had moderate
hearing impairment and 2 subjects exhibited mild hearing impairment. Furthermore, two subjects carrying the
1494C > T mutation exhibited severe or profound hearing loss, respectively. Among four subjects carrying the
1095T > C mutation, two subjects who was treated with
aminoglycosides had profound and severe hearing loss,
respectively, while two individuals who did not have a
history to exposure exhibited profound and mild hearing
impairment.
Clinical and genetic characterization of 5 hearingimpaired Chinese subjects carrying one of 5 putative 12S
rRNA mutation

Comprehensive medical histories of 5 probands carrying
one of 5 putative 12S rRNA mutations and other members in these families showed no other clinical abnormalities, including diabetes, muscular diseases, visual loss
and neurological disorders. As shown in Table 3, two
subjects received a regular dose of gentamicin for various
illnesses at the age of 1 year, while other three subjects
did not have a history of exposure to aminoglycosides.
There was no evidence that these subjects had any
known cause to account for hearing loss. Audiological
examination indicated that 2 subjects suffered from
severe hearing loss and 3 subjects exhibited profound
hearing loss. Variable patterns of audiometric configurations were detected in these subjects: 1 subject with
slope-shaped pattern and 4 individuals with flat-shaped
pattern. Besides the proband, no one of the NS016 pedigree carrying the 747A > G variant suffered from hearing
loss. The pedigree FE239 with three matrilineal affected
relatives carrying the 1027A > G mutation showed suggestively maternally transited hearing loss. Furthermore,
two matrilineal relatives of 14 members in the pedigree
NB005 carrying the 839A > G mutation, as shown in
Figure 2, suffered from hearing loss. In addition, four of
16 members in the pedigree ZX039 carrying the 1413T >
C variant experienced the loss of hearing.
Mutational analysis of GJB2 gene

phenotype, we performed the mutational screening of

program (De Rijk and De Wachter, 1997). The variants were indicated by arrows.

GJB2 gene in 39 subjects carrying the known deafnessassociated 12S rRNA mutations and 5 subjects carrying
one of 5 putative 12S rRNA mutations. As shown in
Table 3, the subject ZX039-IV-1 carrying the 12S
rRNA 1413T > C mutation harbored the known
235DelC/299DelAT mutation in the GJB2 gene [36,37],

while none of other mutations in GJB2 gene was
detected in other 43 affected subjects. Indeed, the
absence of mutation in the GJB2 gene in those subjects
with hearing impairment indicated that the GJB2 gene
did not contribute to the deafness phenotype in those
subjects.

Figure 2 Five Han Chinese pedigrees with aminoglycoside-induced and nonsyndromic hearing impairment. Hearing impaired individuals
are indicated by filled symbols. Arrowhead denotes probands. Asterisks denote individuals who had a history of exposure to aminoglycosides.

Discussion
The cohort of Chinese pediatric hearing-impaired subjects consisted of 98 subjects with aminoglycoside ototoxicity and 342 subjects, who did not have a history of
exposure to aminoglycosides. Of known deafnessassociated 12S rRNA mutations, the 1555A > G mutation accounted for 7.5% cases of this Chinese clinical
population, while incidences of this mutation were
1.76% and 3.96% in two large cohorts of hearing
impaired pediatric Han Chinese subjects from schools of
deaf children [22,36]. In the present study, the incidences of the 1555A > G mutation were 2.7% and 21.4%
cases of nonsyndromic and aminoglycoside-induced
hearing loss, respectively. In fact, the incidences of the
1555A > G mutation varied among different ethnic origins. With regard to the subjects with aminoglycoside
ototoxicity, the incidences of the 1555A > G mutation
were 33% in a small Japanese cohort [19] 13%, 10.4%
and 5% in three Chinese cohorts [3,21,22] and ~17% in
the two white cohorts from United States and Spain
[5,32,33]. However, the incidence of 1555A > G mutation in nonsyndromic hearing loss was much lower than
in those with aminoglycoside ototoxicity. In two white
cohorts with nonsyndromic hearing loss, the frequency
of the 1555A > G mutation varied from 0.6% to 2.5%
[20,24], while the incidence of the 1555A > G mutation
in several Asian cohorts ranged from 2.9% to 5.3%
[19,21-23]. Thus, the large proportion of subjects with

aminoglycoside ototoxicity in this cohort may contribute
to higher incidence of the 1555A > G mutation than
other cohorts. On the other hand, the incidences of the
1494C > T mutation appeared to be lower than those of
the 1555A > G mutation. In this cohort, two subjects
carrying the 1494C > T mutation had a history of exposure to aminoglycosides. This data appeared to be
higher than the previous reports that three familial cases
of 1340 sporadic Spanish hearing-impaired subjects carried the 1494C > T mutation [12] and three cases of
1642 pediatric deaf children [22]. Therefore, these two
known 12S rRNA mutations account for from 4% to 8%
cases among these Chinese hearing-impaired populations [10].
Of other known deafness-mutations, the frequency of
the 1095T > C mutation was 0.91% in this cohort. The
1095T > C mutation, whose CI was 92.9%, occurred in
one of 449 Chinese controls. This mutation has been
found in several genetically-unrelated families with nonsyndromic and aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss
[21,22,30,31]. This T-to-C transition disrupted an evolutionarily conserved base-pair at stem loop of the helix
25 of 12S rRNA [27]. This nucleotide is also located at
the P-site of ribosome, suggesting an important role in
the initiation of mitochondrial protein synthesis [31].
Furthermore, the frequency of mutations at position 961
including 961insC and 961T > C was 2.27% in this
pediatric population. Although mutations at this

Shen et al. Journal of Translational Medicine 2011, 9:4
http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/9/1/4

position have been implicated to be associated with
hearing loss in different ethnic groups [21,22,32,33], the
lower CI (42.9%) and presence of 4% in the controls
indicated that mutations in this position were
polymorphisms.
A total of 41 (39 known and 2 novel) variants in 12S
rRNA gene were identified in this cohort. Similar to
other mtDNA variations, these variants can be grouped
into three categories: neutral, adaptive and deleterious
[35]. To identify putative deleterious mutation, these
variants were further evaluated using following three criteria: 1). Absent in the 449 Chinese controls; 2). CI is
>78%, proposed by Ruiz-Pesini and Wallace [35];
3). Potential structural and functional alterations [22].
Among these variants, 19 variant were absent in the 449
Han Chinese controls, while the frequency of other variants ranged from 0.2% (13 variants such as 789T > C)
to 22.7% (709G > A variant) in this Chinese control
population. In particular, some of these variants occurring at high frequencies of both control and patient
populations were the mitochondrial haplogroup specific
variants [36]. These included the 663A > G variant of
haplogroup A, the 827A > G and 1119T > C variants of
haplogroup B4, the 709G > A and 1598G > A variants
of haplogroup B5, the 1382A > C variant of haplogroup
D4, the 681T > C, 752C > T, 1048C > T and 1107T > C
variants of D5 haplogroup, the haplogroup F2 specific
variant 1005T > C, the 1041A > G variant of haplogroup
M9a, and the 1541T > C variant of haplogroup R5b
[38]. Apparently, these haplogroup specific variants were
adaptive or neutral but unlikely deleterious.
Phylogenetic analysis showed that CIs of 28 variants
were more than 78%. Despite their higher CI, the 14
variants such as 663A > G, 681T > C, 752C > T, 735A
> G, 827A > G, 1107T > C, 1382A > C and 1438A >
G were present in the controls. On the other hand, the
CIs for other 7 variants including 1555A > G and
1494C > T were at least 78% but these variants were
absent in 449 Chinese controls. Based on the predicted
secondary structure of mitochondrial 12S rRNA
[27,35], 23 variants were located at the loops and 18
variants occurred in the stems of this rRNA. Among
these variants, 11 variants including the 1095T > C
disrupted a WC base pairing(s) of 12S rRNA, while 5
variants including the 1555A > G and 1494C > T created a novel WC base-pairing(s) of this rRNA [28,29].
In fact, the 1555A > G or 1494C > T mutation made
the mitochondrial ribosome more bacteria-like
[4,11,14]. Functional characterization demonstrated
that the 1555A > G or 1494C > T mutation conferred
sensitivity to aminoglycosides [11,15,16,18]. Thus, individuals carrying either of mutations are predisposed to
hearing loss. Indeed, the novel 747A > G variant and
the known 839A > G, 1310C > T and 1413T > C

Page 9 of 11

variants [22,34], which resided at the stems of 12S
rRNA, were fitted with three criteria for the pathogenic mutations as described above. Furthermore, the
1027A > G variant, whose location was at a loop in
the 12S rRNA and whose CI was 92.9%, was absent in
449 Han Chinese controls. Thus, alterations of the tertiary or quaternary structure of 12S rRNA by these
putative variants may lead to significant effects on
function, thereby contributing to the deafness phenotype. Genetic and clinical evaluations of these five
hearing-impaired Chinese subjects carrying one of 5
putative 12S rRNA mutation were performed. The
pedigree FE239 carrying the 1027A > G mutation exhibited suggestively maternally transited hearing loss, while
other four pedigrees did not have a typically maternal
inheritance of hearing loss. The presence of the known
235DelC/299DelAT mutation in the GJB2 gene in the
subject ZX039-IV-1 carrying the 1413T > C mutation
indicated its role in the deafness phenotype. The
absence of mutation(s) in the GJB2 gene in other four
subjects suggested the involvement of other modifier
factors in the phenotypic manifestation of these putative
deafness-associated 12S rRNA variants, as in the case of
these families carrying the 1555A > G mutation [39].
Further genetic and biochemical characterizations were
necessary for the understanding the pathophysiology of
these putative deafness-associated 12S rRNA mutations.
Moreover, approximately 70% of subjects with aminoglycoside-indece hearing loss in this cohort did not
carry the pathogenic 12S rRNA 1555A > G and 1494C >
T mutations as well as putative deafness-associated 12S
rRNA mutations. These data implicated the involvement of other nuclear genes, besides mitochondrial 12S
rRNA mutations, in development of hearing loss in
these subjects.

Conclusions
Mutations in mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene accounted
for approximately 30% cases of aminoglycoside-induced
hearing loss in this cohort. These results strongly support the idea that the mitochondrial 12S rRNA is the
hot spot for mutations associated with aminoglycoside
ototoxicity. These data have been providing valuable
information and technology to predict which individuals
are at risk for ototoxicity, to improve the safety of aminoglycoside antibiotic therapy, and eventually to
decrease the incidence of deafness.
