Leucine-Rich repeat receptor kinases are
sporadically distributed in eukaryotic genomes

Abstract
Background: Plant leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) are receptor kinases that contain LRRs in
their extracellular domain. In the last 15 years, many research groups have demonstrated major roles played by
LRR-RLKs in plants during almost all developmental processes throughout the life of the plant and in defense/
resistance against a large range of pathogens. Recently, a breakthrough has been made in this field that challenges
the dogma of the specificity of plant LRR-RLKs.
Results: We analyzed ~1000 complete genomes and show that LRR-RK genes have now been identified in 8 nonplant genomes. We performed an exhaustive phylogenetic analysis of all of these receptors, revealing that all of
the LRR-containing receptor subfamilies form lineage-specific clades. Our results suggest that the association of
LRRs with RKs appeared independently at least four times in eukaryotic evolutionary history. Moreover, the
molecular evolutionary history of the LRR-RKs found in oomycetes is reminiscent of the pattern observed in plants:
expansion with amplification/deletion and evolution of the domain organization leading to the functional
diversification of members of the gene family. Finally, the expression data suggest that oomycete LRR-RKs may play
a role in several stages of the oomycete life cycle.
Conclusions: In view of the key roles that LRR-RLKs play throughout the entire lifetime of plants and plantenvironment interactions, the emergence and expansion of this type of receptor in several phyla along the
evolution of eukaryotes, and particularly in oomycete genomes, questions their intrinsic functions in mimicry and/
or in the coevolution of receptors between hosts and pathogens.

Background
Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are plant-specific transmembrane (TM) receptor kinases (RKs) that are closely
related to the Pelle proteins, a family of animal cytoplasmic kinases. These RLK/Pelle proteins are involved in
host defense against a range of pathogens and are also
key regulators of many developmental processes in both
plants and animals [1-4]. In an extended phylogenetic
analysis of eukaryotic receptor kinases, Shiu and
Bleecker (2001) have shown that, with respect to the
kinase domain (KD), the RLK/Pelle, receptor tyrosine
kinase (RTK), receptor serine/threonine kinase (RSK)
and Raf protein subfamilies form a monophyletic group,
the receptor kinase group (RKG), that is distinct from
all other eukaryotic kinases [5,6]. All plant RLKs possess

a single-pass TM domain and an intracytoplasmic KD
but differ in their extracellular domain (ECD) [5]. Members of the largest RLK subfamily, the leucine-rich
repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs), contain 1 to 30
leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) in their ECDs (Figure 1A).
Plant LRR-RLKs are involved in many developmental
processes and in host responses to biotic and abiotic
stresses [7,8]. Animals also possess LRR-containing
receptors (the Toll and Toll-like receptors) that play a
role in development and immunity [9]. Interestingly,
these animal receptors contain LRRs in their ECD but
do not possess a KD, and several transduce their signal
by activating kinase-containing co-receptors through the
binding to adaptor proteins. Because the structural organization (LRRs exclusively in the ECD, followed by a
TM and a KD with serine/threonine kinase activity) was
previously found only in plants, a plant-specific dogma
for LRR-RLKs was expounded for many years. However,

LRR and KD domains are highly versatile with respect
to their associations with other protein domains and are
predicted to be present in all genomes from bacteria to
humans [10].
In this report, we show that LRR-KD subfamilies have
been reinvented in several eukaryotic genomes outside
plants. Moreover, the evolutionary history of these LRRRKs is comparable to the one described for the LRRRLK plant subfamilies.

LRR-containing receptor kinases are not plant-specific

As LRRs and KDs are present in all genomes, we
searched for the presence of structurally related LRRRLKs in non-plant lineages. We analyzed 884 bacterial,
50 archaeal and 77 eukaryotic genomes to identify LRRcontaining RKs that were structurally related to plant
LRR-RLKs (Figure 1B). Additional file 1 details the
references and links for all of the genomes analyzed.
Our study reveals that, among all of the genomes outside of land plants that were analyzed, LRR receptor
kinase (LRR-RK) subfamilies are present in the genomes
of Monosiga brevicollis (a choanoflagellate), Chlorella
variabilis NC64A (a green alga) and several stramenopiles (Ectocarpus siliculosus [a brown alga] and all of the
oomycetes analyzed) (Figure 1B). Some of these findings
have recently been reported, albeit unobtrusively, mentioned as only a side discovery notice in two articles
[11,12]. Our detailed analysis shows that the Ectocarpus,
Chlorella and Monosiga genomes contain 2, 5 and 7
LRR-RK genes, respectively, whereas the oomycete species (Saprolegnia parasitica, Pythium ultimum, Phytophthora infestans, Phytophthora ramorum and
Phytophthora sojae) contain up to 34 LRR-RK genes per
genome. The step-by-step procedure used to detect the
LRR-RK genes is described in Additional file 2. These
LRR-RKs possess up to 26 LRRs in their ECDs (Additional file 3). Interestingly, although we searched for
other domains (known to be present in plant ECDs,
including lectins, duf26, EGF, lysM, Slocus, thaumatin
and PAN) associated with RKs in oomycetes, we did not
find any.
LRR-RK subfamilies have been reinvented several times in
eukaryotic genomes and evolved independently from
each other

A phylogenetic analysis of a representative subset of animal and plant eukaryotic kinases and all of the LRRRKs, including receptors that are closely related to LRRRKs but lack TM domains and/or LRRs, has been performed (Figure 2; see Additional file 4 for the sequence
alignment and Additional file 5 for the details of Figure
2). This analysis reveals that the Ectocarpus, Chlorella,
Monosiga and oomycete LRR-RK genes form four

KDs and other eukaryotic kinases. The phylogenetic tree was
generated from an alignment of the KDs (Additional file 4) of
representative Arabidopsis and animal protein kinases, LRRcontaining RKs and closely related receptors lacking TM domains
and/or LRRs from Monosiga brevicollis (Monosiga, brown), Chlorella
variabilis NC64A (Chlorella, greenish blue), Ectocarpus siliculosus
(Ectocarpus, gray) and oomycetes (oomycetes, blue). Oomycete LRRRKs, Monosiga LRR-RKs, Chlorella LRR-RKs and Ectocarpus LRR-RKs are
included in the monophyletic receptor kinase group (RKG, red box),
consisting of the plant receptor-like kinase (RLK) and animal
cytoplasmic Pelle (forming the RLK/Pelle subfamily, green), receptor
serine/threonine kinase (RSK, light blue), receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK, khaki) and Raf (Raf, pink) proteins. The RKG members are
distinct from the other eukaryotic kinases. See Additional file 5 for
the detailed phylogenetic tree.

separate lineage-specific clades within the eukaryotic
RKG. Because we did not observe incongruence between
the phylogenetic and the species trees, we excluded the
hypothesis of lateral transfer of the LRR-RK genes
between species. However, because the tree is not fully
resolved, we cannot rule out the possibility that the KDs
of the LRR-RKs are more closely related to one of the
RKG subfamilies. Nevertheless, with regard to the combination of the three modules (LRRs, TM and KD) to
form new genes that are structurally related to LRRRLKs, the most parsimonious hypothesis, based primarily on the species tree (Figure 1B), is that the association
of LRRs with RKs appeared independently at least four
times in eukaryotic evolutionary history. This hypothesis
is supported by previous work on plants that showed
that the KD of the RLK families has been recruited several times to form all of the LRR-RLK subfamilies [5].
Moreover, LRR domains are known to be highly versatile with respect to their associations with other protein
domains [10]. Thus, our study expands what has been
observed in plant lineages to several eukaryotic genomes. Alternatively, even if much less parsimonious, we
cannot completely rule out a third hypothesis, which
states that the LRR-RK and LRR-RLK gene families
evolved from a common ancestor and have been subjected to massive gene losses.
LRR-RK genes are in expansion in certain oomycete
genomes

In plants, LRR-RLKs show a pattern of expansion with
amplification/deletion and evolution of domain organization leading to the functional diversification of the
members of the gene family [1]. The same evolutionary
history can be observed in the oomycete LRR-RK subfamily. Indeed, we were able to identify gains and losses
of LRR-RKs in each oomycete genome analyzed (Additional file 6). Moreover, some of the gene subgroups are
Saprolegnia- or Phytophthora-specific, suggesting that

Page 4 of 9

several duplication events occurred independently in the
Saprolegnia and Phytophthora genomes to give rise to
~25 copies in each lineage (Additional file 5B). In the
Phytophthora-specific subgroups, most of the duplications are present in all of the Phytophthora genomes,
indicating that these genetic changes occurred in the
last common ancestor of the Phytophthora species.
However, a few duplications are species specific, implying the possibility for the acquisition of new functions
of these genes in these species. Notably, the absence of
amplification in the Pythium genome and the independent amplifications in the Saprolegnia and Phytophthora
genomes suggest that these genes may be involved in
signaling pathways and, therefore, in functions that have
diverged between Saprolegnia, Phytophthora and
Pythium species. Indeed, similar to what is known in
plants, these oomycete receptors could be involved in
the perception of diverse signals leading to multiple cellular responses [8,13,14].
Oomycete LRR-RKs may play a role in several stages of
the oomycete life cycle

To determine whether these oomycete LRR-RK genes
are expressed, we first performed an in silico gene
expression analysis by identifying expressed sequenced
tags (ESTs) in the public databases (Additional file 7).
Among the 85 oomycete LRR-RK genes assessed, 22 are
represented by one to eight ESTs. These ESTs were
obtained from libraries of various developmental stages,
indicating that the oomycete LRR-RK genes are
expressed during vegetative growth, mating, dissemination and host infection. To analyze the expression of
these LRR-RK genes further, we used the plant pathosystem available in our laboratory: the Phytophthora
parasitica/Arabidopsis thaliana interaction [15]. First,
we searched for ESTs of Phytophthora parasitica and
retrieved 6 ESTs (Additional file 8). Next, we verified
and analyzed the expression patterns of these LRR-RK
genes using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) at several key stages during the course of the pathogen/host interaction (Figure
3): penetration (At-2.5 hpi (hours post inoculation)),
biotrophic invasive growth (At-6 hpi and At-10.5 hpi),
switch to necrotrophy (At-30 hpi) and necrotrophy (At96 hpi). The data reveal that these genes are actually differentially expressed in the course of Arabidopsis thaliana infection. Moreover, the divergences in the
expression profiles among the LRR-RK genes analyzed
indicate that functional diversification may have
occurred in the oomycete LRR-RK family. Taken
together, these results suggest that these receptors could
be involved in the perception of environmental cues, in
the adaptation to specific conditions encountered in the
host and/or in various developmental processes.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have shown that the Monosiga, Chlorella, Ectocarpus and oomycete LRR-RK receptors belong
to the RKG and are likely to have acquired the LRRs in
their ECDs independently. The evolutionary history of
the oomycete LRR-RK receptor subfamily is consistent
with the molecular evolution of plant LRR-RLKs [16,17].
Saprolegnia and Phytophthora species have developed,
expanded and functionally diversified a subfamily of
receptors that are structurally, but not phylogenetically,
related to plant LRR-RLKs. Considering the key roles
that plant LRR-RLKs play throughout the plant life cycle
and in plant-environment interactions, it is tempting to
propose that oomycete LRR-RKs may be important regulators of the oomycete life cycle. Future work should
focus on deciphering the functions of oomycete LRRRKs in host-oomycete interactions to reveal new targets
to help combat these pathogens, which pose a serious
threat to plants and aquaculture farming worldwide,
causing tremendous economic damage every year [18].

heidelberg.de/ to check whether domains other than
LRRs were predicted in the extracellular domain (ECD)
of each protein [22]. If other domains were detected, the
protein was rejected. Proteins containing only LRRs in
their extracellular domain (ECD), a TM domain and a
KD were classified as LRR-RKs. For the phylogenetic
analysis presented in Figure 2, we first retrieved all of
the peptide sequences of eukaryotic protein kinases used
in [5] to establish the phylogenetic relationship between
plant and animal protein kinases. We next retrieved one
LRR-RLK protein per subgroup from the Arabidopsis
genome. Finally, we included all of the newly identified
LRR-RK proteins from the oomycete, Monosiga, Ectocarpus and Chlorella genomes. In oomycetes, Ectocarpus,
Monosiga and Chlorella, we also retrieved proteins
sequences of closely related kinases found using a Blastp
search. This search was performed using the KD of the
LRR-RKs, and we selected the non-LRR-RK best hit.
Accessions numbers of all of these sequences are listed
in the ‘Accession number’ section below.

Methods

Alignment and phylogenetic analysis

Genomes analyzed

Peptide KD sequences of all of the kinases to be analyzed (plus four bacterial kinase genes [YP_003956736.1,
ZP_04777056.1, ZP_06621294.1 and P0A5S4.1] used as
the outgroup [23]) were aligned using the MAFFT program (v6.525 b, einsi parameters, 1000 iterations maximum) and manually curated [24]. Phylogenetic trees
were generated under the maximum likelihood criterion
using PhyML 3.0 (LG model, NNI topological moves,
optimizing branch lengths and branch supports). For the
approximate likelihood ratio test (aLRT), we used the
minimum value between the parametric approximate
likelihood ratio test (aLRT, Chi2-based) and the nonparametric aLRT (based on a Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like
procedure) [25,26]. All of the branches with support
values less than 90 were collapsed. All of the manipulations of phylogenetic trees were performed using the
TreeDyn [27] and MEGA4 [28] programs.

To analyze the representative species across all kingdoms,
we first downloaded several publicly available completely
sequenced genomes from each of the major kingdoms
(Opisthokonta, Plantae, and Chromalveolates) from 2
sources (JGI and NCBI). We also downloaded all of the
available bacterial and archaeal genomes from NCBI.
When LRR-RK sequences were found in one genome, we
downloaded all of the available complete genomes in that
phylum. Thus, the complete proteomes of 77 eukaryotic,
50 archaeal and 884 bacterial species have been downloaded from their respective databases. See Additional file
1 for details regarding the genomes analyzed.
Sequence retrieval and domain predictions

We retrieved genes containing leucine-rich repeats
(LRRs) and a kinase domain (KD) by running the
hmmsearch program (HMMER 2.3.2) to search for the
kinase Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profile
(PF00069.16) within the proteomic sequences of completely sequenced genomes. Within this set of kinase
proteins, we then searched for LRR-domain HMM profiles (PF00560.24) (E value cut-off < 1) [19,20]. Signal
peptides (SPs) and transmembrane domains (TMs) were
predicted using the SignalP http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/ and TMHMM http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/ websites, respectively, hosted at the
Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, Technical University of Denmark [21]. Proteins containing LRRs, a
TM and a KD were then considered to be putative LRRRKs. We used the SMART web site http://smart.embl-

Expression analysis

We used the NCBI tBLASTn web interface to search for
expressed ESTs that were similar (identity > 95%) to our
set of oomycete LRR-RK proteins [29]. Only the Phytophthora infestans, Phytophthora sojae, Pythium ultimum and Saprolegnia parasitica EST databases have
been searched, as the EST database of the Phytophthora
ramorum genome was not available. Each EST sequence
retrieved was validated by a BLASTn search using the
library of nucleotide sequences from that species and
from the Phytophthora infestans nucleotide sequences in
GenBank. To search for ESTs from Phytophthora parasitica, the 24 LRR-RK peptide sequences of

Figure 3 Expression analysis of 5 Phytophthora parasitica LRR-RK genes during their interaction with Arabidopsis thaliana. The relative
mRNA levels have been quantified by qRT-PCR at different development stages: samples corresponding to Phytophthora parasitica mycelium
grown in V8 medium (M), Phytophthora parasitica motile zoospores (Z), and Arabidopsis thaliana roots collected 2.5 (At-2.5 hpi), 6 (At-6 hpi), 10.5

expression ratios relative to the mean expression values of three reference genes (2-DCT). Two independent RNA extractions corresponding to a
pool of more than 5 biological replicates each were used. • and ×, biological replicates; bars, mean values.

Phytophthora infestans have been used as query for a
tBLASTn search on the VBI microbial database http://
vmd.vbi.vt.edu/toolkit/index.php. We used the Phytophthora infestans LRR-RK proteins as queries because
it is the most complete dataset thus far. This search
revealed that at least 25 Phytophthora parasitica genes
are homologous to the 24 Phytophthora infestans LRRRK genes. We searched for ESTs for each of these 25
Phytophthora parasitica LRR-RKs on the NCBI Phytophthora parasitica EST database. The qRT-PCR
expression analysis of 5 of the 6 Phytophthora parasitica

ESTs retrieved was performed as described in Kebdani
et al. (2010) using UBC, WS21 and Mago nashi protein
encoding sequences used as reference genes [30-32].
Note that one of the 6 ESTs (DR440392.1) has not been
analyzed by qRT-PCR because we did not succeed in
designing oligonucleotides sets for this gene.

kinase domain; LRRs, leucine-rich repeats; TM, transmembrane domain;
ECD, extracellular domain; LRR-RKs, Leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase.
Additional file 3: Structural features of the oomycete, Monosiga,
Chlorella and Ectocarpus LRR-RKs and closely related receptors
lacking LRRs and/or TM domains. All sequences except one sequence
of Phytophthora ramorum (Pr81779) and one sequence of Phytophthora
sojae (Ps136026) have been used for the phylogenetic analysis presented
in Figure 2 and Additional file 5. These sequences were excluded
because their KDs did not align with those of the other kinases. In
addition, one sequence of Monosiga brevicollis (Mb34608) and one
sequence of Chlorella variabilis NC64A (Ch136834) produced inconsistent
results in the phylogenetic analysis and do not appear in the tree. These
sequences may represent misannotated proteins or pseudogenes.
Abbreviations: S, Saprolegnia parasitica; Pi, Phytophthora infestans; Pr,
Phytophthora ramorum; Ps, Phytophthora sojae; Pu, Pythium ultimum; Mb,
Monosiga brevicollis; Ch, Chlorella variabilis NC64A; Esi, Ectocarpus
siliculosus; SP, signal peptide; KD, kinase domain; LRRs, leucine-rich
repeats; +, presence; -, absence. See Materials and Methods for details
about predicted SPs, LRR numbers, TM domains and KDs.
Additional file 4: Alignment of LRR-RKs and reference eukaryotic
KDs. The KDs of LRR-RKs from Ectocarpus siliculosus (Esi), Phytophthora
ramorum (Pr), Phytophthora sojae (Ps), Phytophthora infestans (Pi),
Saprolegnia parasitica (S), Pythium ultimum (Pu), Chlorella variabilis NC64A
(Ch) and Monosiga brevicollis (Mb) were aligned with reference eukaryotic
kinases from human (h), Arabidopsis thaliana (At), Drosophila
melanogaster (dm), Danio rerio (dr), mouse (m) and Xenopus tropicalis (Xt).
The positions of the 12 kinase subdomains are shown in roman
numerals.
Additional file 5: Details of the maximum likelihood tree
representing the phylogenetic relationships among the LRR-RK KDs
and other eukaryotic kinases. A. General view of the tree presented
in Figure 2. The phylogenetic tree was generated from an alignment of
the KDs (Additional file 4) of representative Arabidopsis and animal
protein kinases, LRR-containing RKs (☼) and closely related receptors
lacking TM domains and/or LRRs. These sequences, devoid of LRRs and/
or TM domains, have been included to highlight the versatility of these
domains with respect to their associations with KDs. The tree branches
are colored as follows: Monosiga brevicollis (Monosiga, brown); Chlorella
variabilis NC64A (Chlorella, greenish blue); Ectocarpus siliculosus
(Ectocarpus, gray) and oomycetes (oomycetes, blue). Oomycete LRR-RKs,
Monosiga LRR-RKs, Chlorella LRR-RKs and Ectocarpus LRR-RKs are included
in the monophyletic receptor kinase group (RKG, red box) consisting of
the plant receptor-like kinase (RLK) and animal cytoplasmic Pelle (forming
the RLK/Pelle subfamily, green), receptor serine/threonine kinase (RSK,
light blue), receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK, khaki) and Raf (Raf, pink)
proteins. The RKG members are distinct from other the eukaryotic
kinases. Note that the tree is not fully resolved. The addition of more RKs
lacking LRRs to this phylogenetic analysis did not improve the resolution
of the tree (data not shown); similarly, neither did the addition of nonRKs from the oomycete species (data not shown). Branch support values
are shown at the nodes. B. A detailed view of the oomycete clade. In
the oomycete LRR-RK subfamily, some subdivisions are Saprolegnia or
Phytophthora specific (black boxes), suggesting the lineage-specific
amplification by duplications in the Saprolegnia and Phytophthora
genomes. Three subgroups contain both of these lineages with or
without Pythium (orange boxes), suggesting that at least three genes
were present in the last common ancestor of these species. Oomycete
genes with evidence of expression (expressed sequence tags) are

indicated with a plus sign (details in Additional file 7). C. A detailed
view of other clades.
Additional file 6: Number of gains and losses of oomycete LRR-RK
genes in orthologous groups. We counted the number of genes
gained and lost for each orthologous group defined in the oomycete
clades of the phylogenetic tree (Additional file 5B). A. Orthologous
groups containing Saprolegnia, Pythium and Phytophthora species, B.
orthologous groups containing only Pythium and Phytophthora species
and C. orthologous groups containing only Phytophthora species. The
number on the first branch represents the number of genes present in
the last common ancestor. Numbers preceded by a plus sign are the
number of genes gained; numbers preceded by a minus sign are the
number of genes lost.
