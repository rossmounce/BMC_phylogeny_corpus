Abstract
Background: HCV is one of the major health problems in Egypt, where it is highly prevalent. Genotype
4 is the most common genotype of HCV and its response to treatment is still a controversy.
Methods: HCV genotype 4 quasispecies diversity within the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) was studied
in a series of 22 native Egyptian patients with chronic hepatitis C virus with no previous treatment who
satisfied all NIH criteria for combined treatment of pegylated IFN and ribavirine and was correlated with
the outcome of treatment. The study also included 7 control patients with no antiviral treatment. HCV
sequencing was done using the TRUGENE HCV 5-NC genotyping kit.
Results: At the 48th week of treatment, 15 patients (68%) showed virological response. Whereas HCVRNA was still detected in 7 patients (32%) in this period; of those, 6 experienced a partial virological
response followed by viral breakthrough during treatment. Only one patient did not show any virological
or chemical response. The four females included in this study were all responders. There was a significant
correlation between the response rate and lower fibrosis (p = 0.026) as well as the total number of
mutation spots (including all the insertions, deletions, transitions and transversions) (p = 0.007, p = 0.035).
Conclusion: Patients who responded to interferon treatment had statistically significant less number in
both transitions (p = 0.007) and the genetic distances between the quasispecies (p = 0.035). So, viral
genetic complexity and variability may play a role in the response to IFN treatment. The consensus
alignment of all three groups revealed no characteristic pattern among the three groups. However, the G
to A transitions at 160 was observed among non responders who need further study to confirm this
observation.

Background
Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause
of chronic liver disease worldwide [1]. Despite recent success after the introduction of combination therapy with
IFN-α and Ribavirin, about 60% of patients with HCV
genotype 4 fail to respond [2,3]. Resistance to antiviral
therapy remains a serious problem in the management of
chronic hepatitis C.
The basis of treatment of chronic hepatitis C is interferonα (IFN-α), which is currently used in combination with
ribavirin, a molecule that potentiates its antiviral effects
[4]. IFN-α does not inhibit a specific viral enzymatic function, but rather induces modifications of specific immune
responses, and the establishment of a nonspecific antiviral state in infected cells by the activation of numerous cellular genes. Thus, the inhibition of HCV replication is a
consequence, in part, of a global inhibition of translation
in the infected cell. Therapeutic failure is frequent. The
outcome of antiviral treatment seems to depend on many
factors, among which virus-related parameters appear to
play an important role [4]. These include the HCV genotype and the level of both the viral replication and the
genetic complexity of the quasispecies population before
the start of treatment [5,6].
Patients who do not have a sustained response to IFN
therapy constitute a heterogeneous group [7]: some experience persistent viremia and alanine aminotransferase
abnormalities (non-response) or a relapse after treatment
discontinuation (transient response), whereas others have
an initial response followed by reactivation while on INF
therapy (breakthrough). About 10% of patients treated
with IFN alone and 5% treated with IFN in combination
with ribavirin experience a viral breakthrough during
treatment [8,9]. Three main hypotheses have been proposed to explain viral breakthrough during IFN treatment:
(1) the development of anti-IFN antibodies, (2) the
down-regulation of IFN receptors (3) the emergence of
resistant viral strains. The first hypothesis can be partially
ruled out as anti-IFN antibodies are not consistently
found in association with viral breakthrough [10,11]. Second, the down-regulation of IFN receptors during therapy,
as observed for hepatitis B, has not been clearly correlated
to treatment response [12]. The third hypothesis, which is
the emergence of resistant strains during treatment, has
been recently suggested [8]. And it was also shown that
the evolution of hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) quasispecies during IFN mono-therapy was different between sustained responders and patients who experienced a viral
breakthrough [13]. However, no longitudinal study has
yet been performed on other regions within HCV
genomes isolated from patients with a viral breakthrough.
Further more little is known with respect to viral break-

through during IFN-ribavirin combination therapy in
Egyptian patients with HCV genotype 4.
The most prevalent genotype in Egypt is type 4, with the
presence of other genotypes [14]. Sequence analysis of
HCV 5'UTR in Egyptian patients with liver diseases
showed a very highly heterogeneous population of the
virus [15]. Therefore, we investigated heterogeneity, the
composition and molecular evolution of HCV genotype 4
quasispecies during the course of IFN therapy by tracking
individual viral variants in patients with chronic hepatitis
C who exhibited different patterns of response. Our main
objective was to determine whether viral genetic complexity and variability play a role in the response to IFN treatment in Egyptian HCV genotype-4 since no previous
study have addressed or focused specially to Egyptian
HCV genotype-4

Patients and methods
The study included 22 subjects with anti-HCV positive
and high levels of SGPT and SGOT for more than 6
months. They were selected from the outpatient clinic of
El-Kaser El-Aini School of Medicine, Cairo University,
Cairo, Egypt, during the period of October 2002 till
November 2003. Of those 15 were responders, and 7 were
non responders. The study also included 9 chronic hepatitis C patients who did not receive any antiviral treatment
but received only conservative cytoprotective drugs. All
cases were subjected to complete history taking and thorough clinical examination. Liver function tests and liver
biopsy were performed. Samples were tested for anti-HCV
using a commercially available EIA. (Satisfied NIH criteria
for IFN and r TTT)
Treatment strategy
Twenty two chronic hepatitis C patients received combined pegylated interferon alpha 2b (100 μg/week) plus
ribavirin 800–1000 mg/day based on body weight (<70
kg or >70 kg). The other seven patients were considered as
control group, and did not receive any antiviral treatment
and received only conservative cytoprotective drugs.
Inclusion criteria of our patients
Male or Female patients with chronic active hepatitis C
virus, age from 18 to 60 years old negative for HBsAg and
HBsAb, ANA<1:160. They were also positive for anti-HCV
and HCV-RNA by PCR. All had white blood cells
(WBCS)>4.000/mm3, Neutrophils count>2.000/mm3,
Platelets>75.000/mm3, Prothrombin time<2 Seconds
above upper limit of normal (ULN), Direct bilirubin 0.3
mg/dl or within 20% of ULN, Albumin>3.5, Alpha fetoprotein<100, Serum creatinine within normal limit
(WNL), Fasting blood sugar 115 mg or within 20% of
ULN, also T3, T4 and TSH are within normal limit.

Exclusion criteria of our patients
Exclusion of any other causes of liver disease other than
HCV by liver biopsy including (Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson's disease, Hemochromatosis). Exclusion of
co-infection with HBV, Autoimmune disease, Alcoholic or
decompensate liver disease, hypersensitivity to Interferon
or Ribavirin, pregnancy or breast feeding, poorly controlled diabetes, clinically significant retinal abnormalities,
obesity-induced liver disease, drug-related liver disease,
CNS trauma, or active seizures which requires medication,
ischemic cardiovascular disease within the last six
months, Exclusion of immunological mediated disease
(Ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, SLE, Autoimmune
hemolytic anemia, Scleroderma, Psoriasis, Rheumatoid
arthritis, patients with organ transplantation, past history
of Bilhaziasis or substance abuse, abstention for the past
12 months, patients with Amantadine, Flumantadine,
Thymosin, Steroids, and/or Immunosuppressive drugs,
and sever pre-existing Psychiatric conditions or any history of manic element associated to prior Psychiatric history.
Definition of response to therapy
The responses to therapy in patients with HCV were characterized according to the consensus guidelines of the
National Institutes of Health [16]. Responders to therapy
were defined by normalization of serum ALT and absence
of detectable serum HCV-RNA at the end of treatment (12
months). Non-responders were defined by elevated serum
ALT and presence of HCV-RNA at the end of treatment.
Breakthrough was defined arbitrarily as an initial (after 6
months) biochemical and virological response, characterized by a normalization of ALT levels and a significant
decrease of HCV-RNA titer of more than one log 10 up to
no detectable HCV RNA, and a subsequent significant
increase of more than one log 10 or reappearance of HCVRNA in the serum during therapy, followed by return of
ALT levels to abnormal values.
Cloning and sequencing of the HCV 5-UTR region
For cloning and sequencing of the HCV 5-UTR, HCV RNA
was extracted from the sera by the silica method as previously described [Boom et al., 1990]. RT and PCR of HCV
were performed with a primer pair selected from the
highly conserved 5-UTR of HCV genome [17]. All steps
were done as previously described [18]. The following
sequences were used as antisense primers for c-DNA synthesis HCV-6 [5-ACC-TCC nucleotides (NT) 319–324].
The internal primers were RB6A and RB6B for amplification of 266 bp of the 5-UTR, RB6A [5-GTG AGG AAC TAC
TGT CTT CAC G-3 (NT 47–68)], and RB6B [5-ACT CGC
AAG CAC CCT ATC AGG -3 (nt292-312)] [18]. All samples were analyzed twice for HCV RNA by the RT-PCR on
different days with identical results. Upon completion of

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/16

the amplification reaction, 10 μl of each PCR reaction
product was analyzed by electrophoresis.
Molecular cloning was done with an Original TA cloning
kit (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, CA). The PCR product was
ligated into the pCR 2.1 vector and transformed into competent cells. Plasmid DNA was then amplified in
Escherichia coli and purified with a Qiagen purification kit
(Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Fifteen clones from each
subject were analyzed. The clones were lettered Pre-T or
Aft-T, and numbered from 1 to 15. The insert DNA was
sequenced using the TRUGENE HCV 5-NC genotyping
kit, Visible Genetics, Inc. (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) was
used in conjunction with the Open Gene DNA sequencing
system. A positive control of known standard sequence
and a negative HCV control provided with the kit were utilized as controls in each run and sequenced by CLIP
sequencing which allows both directions of the target
amplicon to be sequenced simultaneously in the same
tube using two different dye-labeled primers (Cy5.0 and
Cy5.5) for each reaction. This method provides sequence
information for both positive and negative DNA strands
from a single reaction. The forward and reverse sequences
are combined to form a query sequence. The query
sequence is then compared to previously characterized
isolates in the TRUGENE HCV 5- NC Module of the Open
Gene software system in order to determine the HCV genotype of the sample. Gene Objects software analyzes chromatograms from each sample; the final 5- UTR sequence
was obtained from the comparison of both sequenced
strands [15]. This information is compared with deposited HCV sequences by Gene Librarian TM software with
a minimal concordance of 98%. The genotype assignments of these samples were confirmed by BLAST
searches.
Multiple sequence alignment
The sequences of the three groups were aligned using the
Clustalw 1.81 software [19]. Sequence alignment editing
visualization, and conservation, and positional entropy
plots were done on BIOEDIT V 7.0 [20]. The positional
entropy plot is a measure of the lack of predictability for
an alignment position. The entropy is 0 at a position
where you have a maximum guess (information) for
nucleotide sequence in this position, and it is maximum
when you have equal possibility for each nucleotide (A, G,
C or T) in this position. Analysis of insertions, deletions,
transitions (in which a purine is substituted for a purine
or a pyrimidine for a pyrimidine), and transversions (in
which a purine is substituted for a pyrimidine and vice
versa) was done on the sequence alignment of all groups
against the consensus of each group. Phylogenetic Analysis and distances of the sequences was done using Clustalw 1.81 software.

Statistical analysis
The results are expressed as the mean ± SD. Non-parametric ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis test) was used to compare
means of more than 2 groups. Significance levels of ≤ 0.05
were considered significant.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers
The nucleotide sequences reported here are deposited in
The National Center for Biotechnology Information/
National Institute of Health GenBank nucleotide
sequence database The accession numbers are: [GenBank:
AY 661552, AY 673080–AY 673111].

Results
Distribution of different HCV genotypes in the studied
groups is shown in table 1. As proven by Blast analysis,
genotype 4 was the most common genotype, representing
90% of the cases, the rest three cases (10%) had genotypes
1a, 1b, and 3a. All of the responders were infected with
genotype 4, except two patients with genotype 1b and 3a.
Also one of the nonresponders was infected with HCV
genotype 1a (breakthrough patient number 6).
At the 48th week of treatment, HCV RNA was cleared from
serum in 15 responder patients (68%) whereas HCV RNA
was still positive in the serum of 7 non responder patients
(32%) in this period; 6 of those 7 patients experienced a
viral breakthrough during treatment. HCV RNA dropped
to undetectable levels in 3 and in 3 patients HCV RNA
decreased but did not become undetectable.
The three groups of patients were similar with respect to
demographic and clinical characteristics except that the
total population was male and the four females included
in this study were all responders. Also, responders were
characterized by a less fibrosis score in the liver biopsy
than non responders, and the difference was statistically
significant (p = 0.026) (Table 2).
The mean base line viral load and number of quasispecies
was higher in the responder group compared to the nonresponders and controls, however, the difference was not
statistically significant (Table 3). Whereas patients who
responded to interferon treatment had statistically significant (p = 0.007, p = 0.035) less number of transitions and

genetic distances between the quasispecies than in the
other two groups (Table 3). (see Additional file 1 a–d).
The genetic distances were made available through the
phylogenetic trees of controls group (Figure 1), nonresponders and breakthrough patients (figure 2) and
responders (figure 3). Three breakthrough patients
cleared the virus after three months but returned to nearly
the same base line viral load. The other three breakthrough patients had a mean of 2.5 folds less viral load by
the third month and returned to the same baseline viral
load. Table 3 also shows that the total number of mutation spots (including all the insertions, deletions, transitions and transversions) were less among responders than
in the other two groups (p = 0.275). This was also obvious
by their position entropy plots (figure 4) which showed
that responders had the lowest number of position variability than among the other two groups.
We constructed a consensus sequence of each group that
shows the highest expectancy of bases in every position.
The consensus alignment of all three groups revealed no
characteristic pattern during viral breakthrough and controls, whose genome sequences looked very unsimilar in
their alignments (see Additional file 1a–d).
Table 4 shows the conserved and variable regions in the
sequences of the three studied groups. It was noticed that
responders are characterized by larger conserved sequence
regions in comparison to the nonresponders and controls.
Sequences from 35 to 100 and from 100–170 were highly
conserved among responders except in patient number 10
who showed transition at position 47, and patients numbers 3, 4, and 9 who had variable position 70. The highest
variability is between positions 5 and 34.
Sequence region from nucleotide 35 to 100 of the pretherapeutic sequences were highly conserved between
responders and the nonresponder and breakthrough
patients infected by the same genotype, and remained
highly conserved during and after treatment in all patients
except for the nonresponder patient (3 positions), breakthrough number 3 (2 positions), and number 4
(1position).

The patient who did not show any response throughout
the whole treatment period had a one insertion at position between 187–189, whereas it showed 8 transitions,
and 5 transversions after treatment that were not there in
the before treatment. Also breakthrough patient number 1
had only one transition before treatment but had three
transitions and 1 transversion at the end of treatment.
Generally, the total number of mutational spots in the
nonresponders before treatment is less than that at the
end of treatment (Table 5).

Table 5 and the alignment in additional file 1-b also
shows that after treatment with interferon, the sequence
showed mutations compared to the pretherapeutic samples in NR, BT1, BT3, BT4, and BT5. Figure 5 shows the
phylogenetic tree of those patients individually pre and
post treatment with no great differences among each. The
only specific mutation identified is a transition from "G"
to "A" in BT2 and BT5 pre treatment that was also mutated
in the NR (genotype 4g), BT2, BT4, and BT5 (all genotype
4) after treatment. This position is not mutated in the
responder group.

Discussion

Antiviral treatment of HCV with interferon (IFN) α, or
more recently pegylated IFN α, and ribavirin lead to a sustained virological response in more than 50 % of patients
[21-23]. Patients with chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis C
virus type 4 showed 8% sustained virological response to
interferon alone but 52% response rates to interferon
combined with ribavirin [24]. When Pegylated interferon/
ribavirin was used to treat chronic hepatitis C genotype 4
patients, 13/30 (43.3%) showed end of treatment virological response in comparison to 11/31 (35.5%) only after
conventional interferon/ribavirin combination therapy
[25]. Their figure was less than ours; as our patients with
genotype 4 showed sustained response rates of 68% when
treated with pegylated interferon/ribavirin combination
treatment for 48 weeks. The differences noticed might be
due to the fact that their patients had compensated liver
diseases; unlike ours. This figure, however, was in agreement with that in our previous study [26].
The current study showed that all female patients
responded to treatment, which confirms the results of
Alves et al. [27] who stated that combination therapy with
interferon-alpha plus ribavirin was effective in one third
of patients. Higher rates of response were observed in
women and in patients infected by genotypes other than
1. This was in contrast with the study of Fargion et al. [28]
in which no significant association with response was
found with sex or age. Also our previous study showed
that six out of 9 (67%) females treated with standard
interferon had sustained viral response, whereas only one

of 5 females treated with pegylated interferon showed
viral response [26].
In this study, the fibrosis score negatively affected the
response of HCV patients to PegIFN treatment. This was in
concordance with Garrido et al. [29] who stated that
Knodell's index like absence of fibrosis at liver histopathology had a predictive value of response, as opposed to
gender, γGT level and source of infection. But that was
against Fargion et al. [28] who found no association of
response to IFN treatment with Knodell score.
The current study elucidated that pretreatment viral load
did not affect the outcome of treatment, which agrees with
the results of Fallows et al. [30], in which HCV RNA levels
did not differ between IFN alpha responders and nonresponders. However, Magrin et al. [31] found in their study
on 100 patients with HCV-RNA positive chronic liver disease that, in absence of cirrhosis, low pre-treatment serum
HCV-RNA level is the most important predictor of
response to IFN therapy.
Non-response is currently defined by the detection of
HCV RNA in serum at the end of treatment. Schematically,
two types of profiles can be observed: the absence of
response during treatment or an initial decrease of HCV
RNA levels followed by an increase or reappearance of
viraemia, also called viral breakthrough [8].
Our study provided evidence that the number of viral
strains and the genetic diversity before treatment did not

correlate with treatment outcome which is in agreement
with Farci et al. [13]. Consistent with these observations,
phylogenetic analysis of viral sequences obtained from all
patients before treatment failed to show any clustering
associated with a specific pattern of response. In contrast,
within the limitation of our data set, analysis of the early
evolution of the viral quasispecies yielded important
prognostic information. In patients who exhibited a sustained therapeutic response, we documented a significant
decrease in the number of viral strains, and overall genetic
diversity. A dramatic reduction in genetic diversity leading
to an increasingly homogeneous viral population was a
consistent feature associated with viral clearance in sustained responders and was independent of HCV genotype

[32]. Also in agreement with our results, a strikingly similar trend of decreasing viral diversity was recently documented just before viral clearance in acute resolving
hepatitis, whereas an increase in viral diversity was found
to correlate with acute hepatitis that progressed to chronicity [32].
Regardless of the mechanism, it is surprising that an RNA
virus that apparently does not induce latent infection can
persist for weeks to months, in both breakthrough and
relapsed patients, in the face of a seemingly complete suppression of viremia. The most plausible hypothesis is that,
despite the disappearance of viremia, very low levels of
viral replication continue to occur, most likely in the liver,

providing a persistent reservoir for virus reactivation after
relapse from the suppressive effects of IFN [32].
The analysis of HCV quasispecies revealed no characteristic pattern during treatment in breakthrough patients,
whose HCV genome profile looked most similar to that of
non-responders [8]. This was evident in our results by
comparing the consensus of the three groups with no
apparent difference in their patterns. Our findings showed
that nucleotide 35–100 is highly conserved between the
three studied groups. The 5'UTR is highly conserved out of
the HCV genomic organization [33].
Analysis of Egyptian genotype 4 in this study was found to
be characterized by a unique mutation site at The G (160)
→ A transition which is a unique mutation among non
responders.
In conclusion, it seems that in HCV genotype 4 in Egypt,
Phylogenetic analysis of viral sequences obtained failed to
show any clustering associated with a specific pattern of
response. The consensus alignment of all three groups
revealed no characteristic pattern among the three groups.
The G (160) → A is a unique mutation among non
responders. There is an apparent reduction in genetic
diversity leading to an increasingly homogeneous viral
population associated with viral clearance in responders.
