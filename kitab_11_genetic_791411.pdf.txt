Background
Morocco is a medium-level epidemic country for Hepatitis B Virus (HBV). However, little is known about clinical, virologic and phylogenetic features of HBV
infection. The aim of the present study is to determine
the HBV genetic variability, and its association with clinical outcome and severity of disease in Moroccan HBV
carriers.
Methods
The study included 250 chronic HBV infection patients
at different stages of liver disease (156 male and 94
female). Serum samples were tested for serological markers and HBV DNA levels. The HBV Surface and core
promoter/precore regions were amplified and directly
sequenced. The clinical, virologic and phylogenetic characteristics were investigated.
Results
The mean age of patients was 44 ± 12.2. Most of them
were HBeAg negative (90%). The mean HBV DNA was
475104 ± 160591 UI/mL. Phylogenetic analysis identified 90% isolates in genotype D and 10% in genotype
A. Most genotypes D isolates belonged to subgenotype
D7 (80%) followed by subgenotype D1 (25%) and one
isolate belonged to subgenotype D2. All genotype A
strains belonged to subgenotype A2 and specified subtype adw2. In genotypes D strains, subtypes ayw2
(91.7%), ayw3 (3.3%) and ayw4 (3.3%) were identified.
A significance prevalence of mutations in the Major
Hydrophilic Region (MHR) of HBsAg was found with
P120T/S the most frequent. In the core promoter
region, the most frequent mutations are G1757A
(48.9%), T1773C (42.8%), C1766GÂ /T (40.8%),
T1753V (30.7%) and A1762T/G1764A (24.4%). In the

precore region, the most common mutations are
G1896A (55.1%) and G1899A (34.6%). Double mutation in the core promoter A1762T/G1764A was found
more frequently in HCC patients than that in non
HCC patients (66.6 % vs 16.2%; p<0.001). In addition,
the prevalence of C1653T, T1753V, and G1862T mutations was significantly higher in HCC patients compared with non HCC. However, the prevalence of the
G1896A precore mutation was not different between
patients with HCC and HBV carriers without HCC
(55.5% vs 55%; p>0.05).

Conclusion
We described for the first time that Subgenotype D7/
ayw2 is the most predominant in Morocco. The high
frequency of mutations in the core promoter in patients
with HCC indicates their association with severity of
infection.
