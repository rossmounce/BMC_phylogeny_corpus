Evolutionary factors affecting Lactate
dehydrogenase A and B variation in the Daphnia
pulex species complex
Teresa J Crease1*, Robin Floyd1,4, Melania E Cristescu2 and David Innes3

Abstract
Background: Evidence for historical, demographic and selective factors affecting enzyme evolution can be
obtained by examining nucleotide sequence variation in candidate genes such as Lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh). Two
closely related Daphnia species can be distinguished by their electrophoretic Ldh genotype and habitat. Daphnia
pulex populations are fixed for the S allele and inhabit temporary ponds, while D. pulicaria populations are fixed for
the F allele and inhabit large stratified lakes. One locus is detected in most allozyme surveys, but genome
sequencing has revealed two genes, LdhA and LdhB.
Results: We sequenced both Ldh genes from 70 isolates of these two species from North America to determine if
the association between Ldh genotype and habitat shows evidence for selection, and to elucidate the evolutionary
history of the two genes. We found that alleles in the pond-dwelling D. pulex and in the lake-dwelling D. pulicaria
form distinct groups at both loci, and the substitution of Glutamine (S) for Glutamic acid (F) at amino acid 229
likely causes the electrophoretic mobility shift in the LDHA protein. Nucleotide diversity in both Ldh genes is much
lower in D. pulicaria than in D. pulex. Moreover, the lack of spatial structuring of the variation in both genes over a
wide geographic area is consistent with a recent demographic expansion of lake populations. Neutrality tests
indicate that both genes are under purifying selection, but the intensity is much stronger on LdhA.
Conclusions: Although lake-dwelling D. pulicaria hybridizes with the other lineages in the pulex species complex,
it remains distinct ecologically and genetically. This ecological divergence, coupled with the intensity of purifying
selection on LdhA and the strong association between its genotype and habitat, suggests that experimental
studies would be useful to determine if variation in molecular function provides evidence that LDHA variants are
adaptive.

Background
Understanding the evolutionary factors that affect genetic
variation in natural populations remains the primary
focus of population genetics. Early surveys of allozyme
variation using protein electrophoresis revealed abundant
polymorphism, but only about one third of the possible
amino acid changes, and none of the variation at silent
and non-coding sites, could be detected with this technique [1]. Analyses of genetic variation now involve
nucleotide data, which can be used in a variety of statistical tests to discriminate between patterns of variation

due to neutral processes (drift, population expansion,
bottlenecks) and various types of selection (positive, purifying, balancing). Most studies have shown that levels of
variation at silent and non-coding sites are substantially
higher than levels of protein variation, suggesting that
the majority of non-synonymous mutations are deleterious [1]. Even so, patterns of allozyme (protein) variation
often appear to conform to neutral or nearly neutral
expectations [2]. Conversely, detailed studies showing
associations with different habitats, or clinal variation
across wide geographic ranges have provided evidence
that functional differences among allozyme variants can
affect fitness (e.g. Alcohol dehydrogenase and Glucose-6phosphate dehydrogenase in Drosophila melanogaster
and Phosphoglucose isomerase in Colias butterflies;

reviewed in [3]). Thus, a major challenge has been to
determine the adaptive significance, if any, of polymorphism and interspecific divergence at allozyme loci [4].
L-Lactate dehydrogenase (L-LDH, EC 1.1.1.27) is
involved in the interconversion of pyruvate and L(-)-lactate, which allows the aerobic metabolism of lactate
accumulated by anaerobic glycolysis following periods of
exposure to lowered environmental oxygen tension, or
hypoxia [5]. There is evidence that selection is acting on
LDH variation in well-studied species such as the killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus [6,7]. For example, an amino
acid substitution between two alleles that vary along a
cline in temperature affects thermostability [8], and
experimental studies have shown that this variation is
involved in the adaptation of killifish to hypoxia [9,10].
A strong association between Ldh genotype and habitat has been also observed in members of the Daphnia
pulex species complex. Based on relative electrophoretic
mobility, the pond species, D. pulex is characterized by
homozygosity for the slow (S) Ldh allele and the closely
related lake species, D. pulicaria by homozygosity for
the fast (F) allele in North America [11-13]. In addition,
the two species hybridize and hybrids are generally
found in ponds or disturbed, intermediate habitats [13].
The genetic and habitat segregation is also associated
with differences in physiological and life history traits
[14,15]. Surveys of allozyme variation in most Daphnia
species are consistent with a one-locus model, but a
recent analysis of the D. pulex genome sequence has
identified two Ldh genes, LdhA and LdhB, that are
approximately 26 cM apart [16,17]. Preliminary gene
expression work suggests that LdhA is expressed at a
significantly higher level than LdhB [18], but the link
between the allozyme locus and the genome sequences
has not yet been made. Nevertheless, the fixation of different LDH variants in D. pulex and D. pulicaria in different aquatic habitats, despite the fact that they share
polymorphisms at other allozyme loci [19-21], suggests
the possibility that Ldh variation is adaptive. However,
the hypothesis that selection has played a role in Ldh
divergence in Daphnia has yet to be tested.
Genetic studies suggest that D. pulex and D. pulicaria
are members of a relatively young species complex and
appear to be undergoing ecological speciation [22]. Both
species reproduce by cyclical parthenogenesis in which
females produce offspring by apomictic parthenogenesis
during favorable conditions and have a sexual phase
that results in the production of diapausing eggs prior
to the onset of unfavorable conditions. Natural hybrids
between the two species reproduce by obligate parthenogenesis [23,24] in which females produce broods of
parthenogenetic offspring (like cyclic females), but also
produce their diapausing eggs parthenogenetically. This

results in a completely ameiotic life history and allows
clonal genotypes to persist for many years.
The objectives of the present study are to analyze both
LdhA and LdhB sequence variation to (1) determine
which locus is detected in allozyme surveys, (2) elucidate the evolutionary history of the two genes in the
context of speciation and hybridization, and (3) determine if there is evidence that selection is acting on the
variation at each locus. To achieve these objectives, isolates of D. pulex and D. pulicaria from North America
were chosen to maximize geographic coverage of the
three Ldh genotypes (SS, SF and FF) and the two breeding systems.

Methods
Daphnia samples

A total of 85 Daphnia isolates collected from 68 populations, mainly from North America, were included in this
study (Figure 1, Additional file 1.1). These isolates
include representatives of all the major lineages in the
D. pulex species complex identified by Colbourne et al.
[25] using phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA
(Figure 2), as well as the C lineage of South American

The Ldh genotype of all of the isolates from North
America was determined by allozyme electrophoresis. In
most cases, isolates were assigned to a species within
the pulex complex [25] based on the sequence of the
mitochondrial NAD dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5)
gene generated by the lab from which the genomic
DNA was obtained (Additional file 1.1). However, isolates that were collected from lakes and reproduce by
cyclic parthenogenesis (i.e. sexually) were designated as
D. pulicaria [13,19] even though some of them have a
D. pulex mitochondrial haplotype. Previous studies have
shown that populations of D. pulicaria with either mitochondrial type are not distinguishable from one another
based on nuclear allozyme and microsatellite variation,
but are divergent from cyclically parthenogenetic populations of D. pulex [22,30]. Of the 85 isolates included
in this study, 70 were classified as either North American D. pulex or D. pulicaria.
Polymerase chain reaction, cloning and sequencing

Figure 2 Neighbor-joining tree of lineages in the Daphnia
pulex species complex. Representative sequences of the
mitochondrial ND5 gene were taken from Colbourne et al. [25]. The
relationship of the SAPC-C lineage, first identified by Mergeay et al.
[26], to the rest of the complex is based on the mitochondrial 12S
rRNA gene. Attempts to amplify the ND5 fragment from members
of this lineage have been unsuccessful. Taxa are indicated as
follows: ARE = D. arenata, EPC = European D. pulicaria, EPX =
European D. pulex, MEL = D. melanica, MID = D. middendorffiana,
NAPC = North American D. pulicaria (e = eastern, w = western, p =
polar), NAPX = North American D. pulex, SAPC = South America D.
pulicaria, TEN = D. tenebrosa.

D. pulicaria identified by Mergeay et al. [26]. An isolate
of Daphnia obtusa from Illinois [27] was also included
as an outgroup for phylogenetic analyses.
Genomic DNA was generally extracted from multiple
parthenogenetically-produced offspring of a single progenitor female using the CTAB method [28]. Isolates
from South America and Europe were extracted from
single individuals preserved in 95% ethanol using the
Mammalian genomic DNA GenElute kit (SigmaAldrich).
The breeding system (cyclic or obligate parthenogenesis) of most lab-reared isolates was diagnosed by examination of diapausing egg cases (ephippia) produced in
the absence of males. While cyclical parthenogens often
release empty ephippial cases unless the eggs have been
fertilized, obligate parthenogens deposit eggs into ephippia even in the absence of males [29].

PCR amplification of the two Ldh loci from Daphnia
genomic DNA was carried out using two sets of primers:
LDHA-u4F (5â-GAAAATGGCCACCAGCGTCG) and
LDHA-1304R (5â-TTGAACTTCATTCAAAGTGGCAGC) for LdhA, and LDHB-u7F (5â-AATCAGAATGCAGACAAAGGCCTC) and LDHB-1477R (5â-TCAGA
ACACCAAGTTTGACTGAACTTC) for LdhB. Each 25
Î¼l PCR reaction contained 1X Phusion HF buffer, 2 mM
MgCl2, 2 mmol of each dNTP, 2 pmol of each primer, and
0.5 units of Phusion High Fidelity polymerase (Finnzymes),
with 2 Î¼l (20 to 50 ng) of the target genomic DNA. The
thermocycling program for the LdhA primers was: 94Â°C
for 2 min; 25 cycles of 94Â°C for 30 s, 54Â°C for 30 s, 72Â°C
for 90 s; a further 10 cycles as above except that the 72Â°C
extension time was increased to 2 min; and finally 72Â°C
for 5 min. A similar program was used for the LdhB primers but with an annealing temperature of 50Â°C.
Amplicons of the expected size (~1.3 kb for LdhA,
~1.4 kb for LdhB) were cloned using the StrataClone
Blunt PCR Cloning Kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturerâs protocol. Colonies were grown on Luria Broth
(LB) agar containing ampicillin (100 Î¼g/ml) and X-gal
(20 Î¼g/ml). Glycerol stocks (LB + amp in 30% glycerol)
were generated for 24 white colonies from each experiment and archived at -80Â°C.
Initially, eight plasmids of the cloned PCR product from
each isolate were selected for sequencing. The cloned
insert was amplified directly from bacterial cells by PCR
using the M13F (5â-GTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTG)
and M13R (5â-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACCATG)
sequencing primers, and Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). If an amplicon of the expected size was not
obtained from all eight colonies, the process was repeated
until at least eight amplicons of the expected size were

Crease et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:212
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/212

obtained. Cycle-sequencing of these amplicons in both
directions was carried out using the BigDye 3.1 kit
(Applied Biosystems) and the M13F and M13R primers.
Each 10 Î¼l sequencing reaction contained 0.25 Î¼l of BigDye mix, 1 Î¼l of sequencing buffer, 10 pmol of primer,
6.75 Î¼l of ultrapure water, and 1 Î¼l of PCR amplicon.
Completed reactions were run on an ABI3730 DNA
Analyzer.
Sequence diversity analyses

A reference sequence was created from the D. pulex genome sequence [18] for each of the Ldh genes indicating
the location of exons, introns and the start and stop
codons. Sequence electropherograms from each cloning
experiment were aligned and edited in Sequencher v.4.5
(Gene Codes) using the reference sequences to orient the
alignment and to trim the ends to the start and stop
codons. The consensus sequence of each allele present
within an isolate was assembled into a master alignment
of all the Ldh alleles for a particular gene. Unique differences among the eight clones from an isolate were
assumed to be PCR, cloning or sequencing errors and
were excluded from the analysis.
An alignment containing alleles from all isolates was
generated for each gene in BioEdit [31]. Separate alignments for the exon and intron sequences were also generated using the reference sequences as a guide.
Analyses of nucleotide diversity included only alleles
obtained from isolates of North American D. pulex and
D. pulicaria and their hybrids. Alleles at both loci were
divided into pulex and pulicaria groups based on their
phylogenetic relationship to alleles obtained from cyclically parthenogenetic isolates from lakes (D. pulicaria)
and ponds (D. pulex). Alleles from isolates that are likely
to be hybrids with a species other than North American
D. pulex or D. pulicaria (one isolate of D. middendorffiana, three isolates of South American D. pulicaria)
were excluded from the diversity analyses.
Standard measures of nucleotide diversity including the
number of haplotypes (K), the number of segregating
sites (S), haplotype diversity (H), the average number of
pairwise differences per site between sequences (Ï) and
diversity per site based on the number of segregating
sites (Î¸) were calculated using the program DNASPv5.10
[32]. Both Ï and Î¸ were estimated for all sites (ÏT, Î¸T), as
well as introns (Ïi, Î¸i), synonymous coding sites (Ïs, Î¸s),
and nonsynonymous coding sites (Ïn , Î¸ n). In addition,
DNASP was used to perform tests of neutrality (Tajimaâs
D; Fu and Liâs D and D*; Fu and Liâs F and F*, Fay and
Wuâs H). Patterns of diversity between the two loci in
each of the pulex and pulicaria allele groups were analysed using an HKA test [33] in DNASP using the D.
obtusa sequence as an outgroup. We used the algorithm
of BetrÃ¡n et al. [34] in DNASP to detect gene conversion

between the pulex and pulicaria allele groups in each
locus.
Separate genetic distance matrices were calculated for
each allele group (pulex and pulicaria) and each locus
based on the number of nucleotide differences between
pairs of alleles in Arlequin 3.11 [35]. The geographic
distance matrix was constructed by calculating the great
circle distance between each pair of sites based on the
decimal degrees of latitude and longitude using the
function ârdist.earthâ with earth radius = 6371 km in
the Fields 5.02 package in R 2.9.2 [36]. A Mantel test
with 1000 permutations was then conducted between
the genetic and geographic distance matrices for each of
the four allele groups using Arlequin.
Phylogenetic analysis

We performed Bayesian phylogenetic analyses on the
unique nt sequences (total and introns only, indels
excluded) of each Ldh gene using Mr. Bayes v3.1.2 [37]
with default prior settings and a GTR model. All trees
were rooted through a sequence from D. obtusa, which is
not a member of the pulex complex but a member of its
sister species complex [38]. We ran two independent and
simultaneous Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses of 15 heated and one cold chain for six million generations sampling from the chain every 100 generations.
The initial 30% of trees were discarded as a burn-in. A
50% majority-rule consensus topology with posterior probability (PP) values for each node was constructed from the
post-burn-in trees. We also constructed Neighbor-joining
trees [39] of the amino acid sequences using MEGA4 [40]
and Poisson-corrected estimates of sequence divergence.

Results
Characterization of sequence variation

We obtained a total of 143 LdhA sequences from the 85
isolates included in the study, of which 76 (53.1%) are
unique. Our sequences begin at the start codon and end
15 nt upstream of the stop codon. This gene consists of
six exons and five introns [18]. The total length of the
sequence alignment is 1394 nt with individual sequences
varying from 1299 to 1352 nt and all length variation
occurring in introns. The coding region is 981 nt resulting in 327 codons for a protein length of 332 amino
acids when the five missing from our PCR amplicon are
included. The total length of intron sequences in LdhA
varies from 318 to 371 nt. The amino acid substitution
of Glutamine (uncharged) to Glutamic acid (negative) at
amino acid 229 changes the overall charge of the protein, which would cause an electrophoretic mobility
shift. Thus LdhA is most likely the locus that is scored
in allozyme analyses. The âCâ to âGâ transversion (CAA
to GAA) that causes this substitution corresponds to nt
912 in the alignment (nt 685 in the coding sequence).

We obtained a total of 157 sequences for LdhB of
which 115 (73.2%) are unique. This gene consists of
eight exons and seven introns [18]. Our sequences begin
with the start codon and end with the stop codon
resulting in a total alignment length of 1545 nt with
individual sequences varying from 1446 nt to 1488 nt.
With the exception of a 2-nt insertion in exon 8 of a
single sequence, all other length variation occurs in
introns. The coding region of 972 nt encodes a protein
of 324 amino acids. The total length of intron sequences
varies from 471 to 513 nt. The alignments of all the
LdhA and LdhB nucleotide and protein sequences are
provided as supplementary information (Additional files
2, 3, 4, 5). All unique nucleotide sequences have been
submitted to GenBank (accession numbers JN117725JN117915).
Phylogenetic analysis

The Bayesian phylogenetic analysis based on complete,
unique LdhA sequences shows that all of the fast LdhA
alleles from North American (NA) D. pulicaria (Additional file 1.2) and hybrids involving this species are monophyletic (Figure 3a). In addition, alleles from NA D. pulex
form a monophyletic group with the exception of 15
recombinant alleles (described below). Because one allele
from this group was isolated from a cyclically parthenogenetic pond population, these alleles were assigned to the
pulex allele group. The two alleles from the European
D. pulex isolate are the sister group to all the other members of the pulex species complex (Figure 3a), which is
concordant with the phylogeny based on mitochondrial
(mt)DNA ([25], Figure 2). However, the sequences from
all the other lineages in the complex cluster with the NA
D. pulicaria alleles, which is not consistent with the
mtDNA phylogeny. For example, D. tenebrosa and European D. pulicaria form a separate cluster (the tenebrosa
group) from species in the pulicaria group in the mtDNA
phylogeny (Figure 2). The tree based on LdhA intron
sequences (Additional file 6a) is similar to the fullsequence tree but relationships within the cluster of alleles
from NA D. pulicaria, which also contains alleles from all
the other species, are not well resolved.
As is the case for LdhA, LdhB alleles from NA D.
pulex and D. pulicaria form two distinct groups (Figure
3b, Additional file 1.2). In contrast to the LdhA tree,
LdhB alleles from D. arenata do not belong to either of
these major groups and their relationship with them is
unresolved. In addition, European D. pulex alleles are
not the sister group to alleles from all the other species,
as is the case for the LdhA and mtDNA trees. The
topology based on intron sequences (Additional file 6b)
is similar except that the D. arenata sequences are the
sister group to alleles from NA D. pulex and all other
sequences cluster with the alleles from NA D. pulicaria.

Recombination between pulex and pulicaria alleles

Analysis of recombination identified gene conversion
tracts between the pulex and pulicaria alleles in both
genes (Additional file 1.3, 1.4). In most cases these are
short (<100 nt) but there are two larger tracts (127 nt in
LdhA and 501 nt in LdhB) which both occur in only
one allele. With one exception for each gene, conversion
tracts consist of pulicaria variants in pulex alleles. A pair
of tracts in LdhA; 28 nt from position 812-839 and 74
nt from position1161-1280 (indels are excluded from
the tracts), occur in 15 pulex alleles from isolates as far
east as Quebec and as far west as the Northwest Territories with most of the alleles occurring in isolates from
Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Indeed, these 15 alleles
form a cluster that groups more closely with the pulicaria than the pulex LdhA alleles in the phylogenetic
tree (Figure 3a).
As most of the LdhA heterozygotes are obligately
parthenogenetic (Additional file 1.1), and are thought to
be F1 hybrids [11,19], we would expect them to be heterozygous for pulex and pulicaria alleles at LdhB as well. This
is indeed the case with nine exceptions, six of which come
from Manitoba and Saskatchewan (Table 1). In all but one
case, the isolate is heterozygous at one locus but homozygous at the other. The exception is an isolate from Saskatchewan that is homozygous for a pulex allele at LdhA
but homozygous for a pulicaria allele at LdhB. There is no
bias with respect to locus or species in the eight isolates;
three are homozygous for the pulicaria allele at one locus,
while five are homozygous for the pulex allele. Similarly,
LdhA is the homozygous locus in four isolates, while LdhB
is the homozygous locus in the other four.
Amino acid variation

Amino acid variation in LDHA is very limited. Indeed,
the outgroup, D. obtusa, and most of the lineages in the
pulex complex have the same amino acid sequence,
which is slow electrophoretically. Fast alleles are only
found in D. melanica, NA D. pulicaria and hybrids,
which also include the three SA D. pulicaria isolates and
one isolate of D. middendorfficana. Overall, the 143
nucleotide sequences encode 11 amino acid sequences
(Figure 4). Of these, seven are unique and four (âslowâ,
âfastâ, D. arenata and European D. pulex) occur more
than once. There are nine (2.8%) variable amino acid
positions and of these, five variants (55.5%) only occur in
one sequence.
The primary differences between pulex (slow) and
pulicaria (fast) LDHA are amino acid substitutions at
two sites; the substitution of Aspartic acid in pulex for
Glutamic acid in pulicaria at position 6, and the substitution of Glutamine in pulex for Glutamic acid in pulicaria at position 229, which likely causes the slow/fast
mobility shift. In addition, the D. arenata and European

D. pulex proteins have Asparagine at position 314 while
all others have Serine. Finally, the protein encoded by
both European D. pulex alleles has Isoleucine at position
132 while all other proteins have Leucine.
There is considerably more amino acid variation
among LDHB proteins, with little differentiation in any
particular lineage (Figure 5). The 157 nucleotide
sequences encode a total of 37 protein sequences of
which only 14 (37.8%) occur more than once. There are
36 (11.1%) variable amino acid positions and of these,
17 variants (47.2%) only occur in one sequence.
Sequence diversity and neutrality tests of pulex and
pulicaria alleles

In general, nucleotide diversity (Ï and Î¸) is substantially
higher in alleles from NA D. pulex (pulex alleles) than in
alleles from NA D. pulicaria (pulicaria alleles) for both
genes, and higher in LdhB than LdhA, with the exception
of Ï s in pulicaria alleles and Ï i and Î¸ i in pulex alleles

(Table 2, Figure 6). In addition, diversity tends to be
higher at synonymous sites than in introns, except for
pulicaria LdhB alleles where diversity is higher in the
introns. As expected, nucleotide diversity at nonsynonymous sites is much lower than that at synonymous sites
and introns (Table 2). The dN/dS ratios for all four
groups of alleles are less than one (Table 3). Pulex LdhA
alleles have the lowest dN/dS ratio (0.032) while pulicaria
LdhB alleles have the highest ratio (0.348).
The results of the Mantel test indicate that there is no
significant correlation between sequence divergence and
geographic distance for the pulicaria alleles at either locus
(Figure 7a and 7c), but there is a significant positive correlation for the pulex alleles at both loci (Figure 7b and 7d).

of genetic diversity. It has been shown that Ldh variation is associated with differentiation between two closely related Daphnia species that occupy contrasting
habitats, and may be a consequence of ecological speciation. In this study, we found that patterns of variation at two Ldh loci are likely a consequence of recent
demographic expansion and purifying selection in D.
pulicaria.
Phylogeny

It is clear that alleles in lake-dwelling NA D. pulicaria and
pond-dwelling NA D. pulex form distinct groups at both
Ldh loci. Moreover, alleles from D. pulex are divergent
from alleles from every other lineage in the pulex species
complex, including those that share the same amino acid
sequence. In addition, relationships among species in the
complex differ substantially in trees based on the nuclear
Ldh and the mitochondrial ND5 (Figure 2) genes. For
example, alleles from species in the tenebrosa group cluster with those from NA D. pulicaria in trees based on
both Ldh loci. Moreover, D. arenata is the sister taxon to
the other members of the complex in the LdhB tree,
although European D. pulex occupies this position in the
LdhA tree, which is consistent with the mtDNA phylogeny
(Figure 2). Vergilino et al. [30] analyzed sequence variation
in the nuclear Rab4 gene from lineages in the pulex species complex and also found that tenebrosa group alleles
cluster with NA D. pulicaria. However, they found that D.
arenata clusters with NA D. pulex, which is consistent
with the mtDNA phylogeny. The only other phylogenetic
analysis of this species complex based on nuclear genes is
that of Omilian and Lynch [22], who analyzed variation at
six nuclear protein-coding genes (one of which was Rab4)
in D. arenata, NA D. pulex and NA D. pulicaria. They
also found that the relationship between D. arenata alleles

and alleles from the other two species varies across the six
loci, which could be a consequence of hybridization and/
or incomplete sorting of ancestral polymorphism [30].
The fact that Daphnia species within the pulex complex have hybridized in the past, and continue to do so,
is well-known [38,41] and this undoubtedly contributes
to the inconsistency between phylogenies based on
mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Despite the lack of

congruence across different nuclear loci, alleles from
each species do tend to form monophyletic groups suggesting that gene pools in this species complex have
been isolated long enough to diverge from one another
at the nucleotide level. One explanation for this pattern
is that the nuclear genomes of some species in this
complex are mosaics of genes derived from multiple
species generated by a complex history of recurrent

introgressive hybridization followed by isolation and
divergence [42]. Phylogenetic analysis of additional
nuclear loci will be required to test this hypothesis.
Hybridization and recombination

Ongoing hybridization between D. pulex and D. pulicaria
should provide opportunities for recombination between
the pulex and pulicaria allele groups at both Ldh loci,
and some instances were observed in this study.
Although the hybrids observed in nature appear to reproduce by obligate parthenogenesis, Heier & Dudycha [43]
found that crosses between cyclically parthenogenetic D.
pulex females and D. pulicaria males produce offspring
that are themselves cyclically parthenogenetic, and are
able to successfully backcross with both parental species
and each other, with no apparent loss of sexual function.
Indeed, we identified a group of 15 recombinant pulex
LdhA alleles with two tracts of sequence from pulicaria
alleles that appear to have arisen in populations from the
Canadian prairies, and are now geographically widespread. In addition, six of the nine isolates with ârecombinantâ LdhA/LdhB genotypes (Table 1) came from
Saskatchewan and Manitoba, including the isolate that is
a pulex LdhA and pulicaria LdhB homozygote. Although,
the breeding system of these isolates is unknown, the pattern of Ldh variation we observed suggests that substantial introgressive hybridization may be occurring between
D. pulex and D. pulicaria in this region, where bodies of
water vary substantially in depth, surface area and the
presence of fish, and thus provide a continuum of habitats between âpondsâ and âlakesâ. This is also consistent
with the occurrence of the Ldh-S allele at low frequency
in lake populations from central and western U.S.A [11]
and Oregon [20], and with the results of Omilian and
Lynch [22] whose analysis indicated that gene flow
between these two species is on the order of 1.7 gene
migrants per generation.
Sequence diversity in D. pulex and D. pulicaria

Nucleotide diversity at synonymous sites in pulex LdhA
(Ïs = 0.027) and LdhB (Ïs = 0.031) alleles is similar to
the average estimate of nuclear protein-coding genes in
other invertebrates (Ï s = 0.027, [44]), and well within
the range of values estimated by Omilian & Lynch [22]
for six nuclear genes in NA D. pulex (mean Ïs = 0.019,
range = 0.000 - 0.050) and NA D. pulicaria (Ïs = 0.015,
range 0.000 to 0.037). In four of the six genes, estimates
of Ïs are higher in D. pulicaria than in D. pulex. In contrast, synonymous nucleotide diversity in both pulicaria
LdhA (Ïs = 0.006) and LdhB (Ïs = 0.007) alleles is substantially lower than that in D. pulex (Ï s = 0.027 for
LdhA, Ïs = 0.031 for LdhB).
The neutrality tests are negative in all cases but only
significant for pulicaria alleles (Table 3), which is

Page 10 of 12

consistent with the operation of purifying selection, a
selective sweep and/or demographic expansion [45]. The
latter two alternatives are also consistent with the lack
of correlation between sequence divergence and geographic distance for the pulicaria alleles at both loci in
the Mantel tests (Figure 7). However, Fay and Wuâs H
statistic is not significant for either gene, which does
not support a selective sweep. Taken together, the lower
level of genetic variation in both Ldh genes in D. pulicaria, and the lack of geographic structuring of this variation suggest a recent demographic expansion of lake
populations over a very wide geographic area after the
evolution of the fast allele at LdhA. Indeed, isolates
from SA D. pulicaria are heterozygous for a pulicariagroup allele at both LdhA and LdhB. The other alleles
in these isolates form a distinct South American cluster.
Recent expansion of D. pulicaria is also consistent with
the results of Omilian and Lynch [22], which suggested
that effective population size (Ne) is much lower in D.
pulicaria than D. pulex, and that the nuclear genomes
of these two species diverged from a common ancestor
on the order of 80,000 years ago.
D. pulicaria and D. pulex are relatively young species
and retain the ability to hybridize, so it is not surprising
that they share alleles at many allozyme loci [19,20].
Despite the occurrence of gene flow between them [22],
they show divergence in physiology and life history traits
[14,15] associated with adaptation to pond and lake
habitats. Previous allozyme surveys have identified two
loci in addition to Ldh, Hexokinase (Hk) and a Peptidase
that are fixed or nearly so for alternate alleles in lake
and pond populations [19]. It has been suggested that
selection, directly on these loci or on loci to which they
are closely linked, may be involved in this divergence.
For example, Pfrender et al. [21] analyzed variation at
13 allozyme loci, 11 microsatellite loci and mtDNA in
Daphnia populations from western Oregon. They identified two pond populations that are genetically distinct
from the D. arenata that typically inhabit ponds in this
region [20,21]. Instead, these two populations are very
similar to Oregon lake D. pulicaria at all loci except
Ldh and Hk, where they are fixed, or nearly so for the
alleles Ldh-S and Hk-M, which invariably predominate
in pond populations.
It is extremely difficult to detect positive selection on
individual amino acid sites by applying standard statistical tests to sequences from one species or closely related
species [46,47]. However, it has been shown that one or a
few amino acid substitutions can cause adaptive changes
in protein function [48-50]. LDH is known to be involved
in response to hypoxia, and variation in levels and temporal patterns of dissolved oxygen are very different in
ponds and lakes. For example, oxygen tension in shallow
temporary ponds decreases while temperature increases

Crease et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:212
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/212

throughout the spring and summer and Daphnia populations generally die by mid-summer due to anoxia or
desiccation [14]. Conversely, deep lakes are generally
stratified during the summer months and Daphnia take
refuge in the cold hypolimnion to avoid fish predation
[14,51]. Members of the pulex species complex tend to
occupy temporary ponds, although species in the tenebrosa group also occur in permanent ponds and small
lakes. However, D. pulicaria is the only species in the
complex that has invaded large, stratified lakes. Moreover, the amino acid sequence of the slow LDHA protein
is highly conserved despite substantial genetic variation
at synonymous sites and introns indicating that this protein is generally under strong purifying selection. The
slow and fast LDHA proteins only differ at two amino
acid sites and neither change is involved in substrate or
NAD binding. Even so, these changes could affect the
catalytic properties of the enzyme, or other properties
such as thermostability. For example, an amino acid substitution between LDHB alleles in the fish, F. heteroclitus
increases thermostability of the proteins found in southern populations [8]. Overall, the strong association
between LdhA genotype and habitat, and different patterns of protein variation in the two Ldh loci, suggest
that experimental studies to determine the adaptive significance of amino acid variation in LDHA are warranted.

Conclusions
The two L-Ldh loci in the Daphnia pulex species complex show substantial variation at the nucleotide level,
but the amino acid sequence of LDHA is much more
conserved than that of LDHB suggesting that the intensity of purifying selection on LdhA is much stronger. Patterns of nucleotide variation also indicate that the fast
LdhA allele arose very recently and spread rapidly over a
very wide geographic area, possibly during a recent
demographic expansion of D. pulicaria lake populations.
Although lake-dwelling D. pulicaria hybridizes with the
other lineages in the pulex complex, it remains distinct
ecologically and genetically. This, coupled with the strong
association between LdhA genotype and habitat, suggests
that experimental studies would be useful to determine if
there is a link between the protein variants and differences in enzymatic function, which could then be evaluated for their effects on fitness to test the hypothesis that
LDHA variation is adaptive.
