Abstract
Background: TT virus is prevalent worldwide, but its prevalence and genotype distribution in
Central and East-Europe has not been determined. The high prevalence of TTV in multiplytransfused patients points to the importance of a parenteral mode of transmission, but since more
than half of the general population is infected other possible routes of transmission must be
considered.
Methods: In our study, we investigated the epidemiology, transmission and phylogeny of TTV in
the Czech Republic. The following groups were selected: a control group of 196 blood donors, 20
patients with hemophilia, 49 intravenous drug users, 100 sex workers, 50 penitentiary prisoners,
208 healthy children aged 1 to 14 years, 54 cord blood samples, 52 patients with non-A-E hepatitis,
74 patients with hepatitis C, and 51 blood donors with increased ALT levels. Primers specific for
the non-coding region were used. The genotype distribution was studied in 70 TTV-positive
samples.
Results: The prevalence rate of TTV among the Czech population was 52.6%. We have shown
that TTV is not transmitted prenatally. Children were infected after birth with two peaks: one at
the age of two years and the other after the beginning of primary school. Adults have shown a
further increase in the TTV prevalence with age. The highest TTV prevalence was found in the
group of patients who had received multiple blood transfusions. The TTV prevalence rate in
subjects at an increased risk of sexual transmission was not significantly higher than in the general
population. Genotypes G2 and G1 were most prevalent among the Czech population, followed by
G8 and G3. The subjects positive for markers of HBV and/or HCV infection tested significantly
more often TTV DNA positive, which is suggestive of a common route of transmission of these
three infections.
Conclusions: This study on TTV prevalence, mode of transmission and age-specific prevalence is
the most extensive study performed in Central and Eastern Europe. It showed insights into the
epidemiology of TTV infection, but failed to associate TTV infection with clinical manifestations.

Background
TTV, a non-enveloped small circular single-stranded DNA
virus, was recently placed in a novel virus family named
Circinoviridae [1]. In spite of being a DNA virus, TTV has
an extremely wide range of sequence divergence. At least
40 TTV genotypes from five major phylogenetic groups
(G1–G5) have been identified [2,3]. The evolutionary distance between the classified genotypes, as measured by
nucleotide substitutions per site, is greater than 30% in
the N22 region of ORF1 [4].
TTV has a worldwide distribution. The prevalence of the
most common TTV genotypes G1 and G2 is similar all
over the world, while the reports on the distribution of
other genotypes are scarce and not conclusive. The rate of
TTV DNA detection is influenced by the selection of the
primer annealing sites. PCR using primers which target
the ORF1 region can detect only TTV genotypes 1–6 of
group 1, but PCR primers designed for the NCR can detect
nearly all genotypes or genetic groups known so far [2].
The prevalence of TT virus in the general population has
ranged between 1.9 and 98%, with the highest rates
detected in the African and South American countries
[5,6]. The TTV prevalence and genotype distribution in
Central and East Europe have not yet been determined.
One Polish study has reported the prevalence of TTV in
blood donors to be 10% by ORF1 primers and 78% by
NCR primers [7]. In a small group of blood donors in the
Czech Republic, Krekulova et al. detected a TTV prevalence rate of 13.5% by ORF1 primers [8].
The mechanisms of TTV transmission have not yet been
elucidated. Even though numerous studies have suggested
that the parenteral transmission via transfusion of contaminated blood and blood products is the most common
route of TTV infection [9], the detection of TTV in many
individuals with no history of blood transfusion indicates
that other routes of transmission of TTV may exist. This
assumption has been further supported by the detection
of TTV in saliva [10], breast milk [11], semen [12] and
vaginal fluid [13]. There is evidence that TTV is excreted
into feces of infected individuals, suggestive of possible
fecal-oral transmission [14]. Some studies have reported
placental transmission of TTV [15-17], whereas others
have not detected TTV in cord blood and amniotic fluid
[18,19]. Since children of TTV-infected mothers apparently tend to get infected more often and earlier after birth
than children of TTV negative mothers, the role of postnatal transmission of TTV is being considered [20,21]. Furthermore, variation in the TTV prevalence in children
from 5.1% in Japan [22] to 54% in the Democratic Republic of Congo [23] is also suggestive of the possible involvement of other specific environmental factors in the
acquisition of TTV infection.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/4/56

TTV was originally isolated from a blood-transfused
patients in which increased alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) levels were detected [24]. Therefore, TTV was
thought to be the possible etiological factor of non-A-G
hepatitis. However, further research has ruled out the
notion that a clinically evident liver disease is a consequence of TTV infection. Other studies, which investigated
the possible link of TTV to other than hepatic diseases are
scarce and so far fail to show any association of TTV infection with clinical manifestation. Nevertheless, the spectrum of diseases studied in association with TTV infection
is very narrow and justifies keeping TTV in the category of
"orphan" viruses [25].
To investigate the possible routes of TTV transmission,
age-specific prevalence and genotype distribution in the
population of the Czech Republic, we analyzed sera of
854 subjects divided into 5 groups based on the type of
risk of TTV transmission. The age-specific distribution of
TTV and correlation with the anti-HBV and/or anti-HCV
status were determined. TTV genotypes were determined
in 70 patients selected from the different groups.

Methods
Population studied
The Human Subjects Committee of the Institutional
Review Boards approved all experimental protocols, and
all subjects enrolled in the study signed an informed consent form. Additional samples were obtained from the
collection of the national reference laboratory for viral
hepatitis (NRL-VH). Five groups of subjects were
analyzed:

Group 1 (normal population, control group) was selected
from 778 healthy blood donors (mean age 29 years, age
range 18–59 years). All donors had normal ALT levels,
and were negative for anti-HCV, anti-HIV and HBsAg.
Since the TTV DNA prevalence in the first 100 subjects
tested was very high we decided to randomly select sera
[26] to include 20 first-time donors and 10 regular donors
from each of five age groups (18–20, 21–30, 31–40, 41–
50 and 50–60 years). In total, 136 sera of first-time donors
and 60 sera of regular blood donors were analyzed.
Group 2 (at high risk of parenterally transmitted infection) consisted of 20 hemophiliacs (peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from 10
patients) (mean age 42 years, age range 21–74 years) and
49 IVDUs. Patients with hemophilia were screened for
anti-HCV, anti-HIV, anti-HBc and HBsAg, IVDUs were
tested for anti-HBc and anti-HCV.
Group 3 (at high risk of sexually transmitted infection)
included 85 sex workers and 15 promiscuous men (mean

age 25 years, age range 18–43 years). All of them were
screened for anti-HCV, anti-HBc, HbsAg and HIV.
Fifty penitentiary prisoners (mean age 29, age range 16–
58 years) were tested for a potential increased risk of
parenteral and/or sexual transmission of the virus. They
were screened for anti-HCV and HBsAg.
Group 4 (at risk of transuterine and mother to child virus
transmission) consisted of 54 cord blood samples and
208 sera of children selected by age (we analyzed 28–30
subjects in each of the following 7 age groups: 1, 2, 3, 5,
8, 11 and 14-year-olds).
Group 5 (at risk of potential etiological involvement of
TTV) included 52 patients with non-A-E hepatitis (mean
age 40 years, age range 9–76 years), 51 blood donors with
elevated ALT levels (mean age 39 years, age range 25–64
years) and 74 patients with hepatitis C (mean age 27
years, age range 2–56 years). All blood donors with elevated ALT levels and all patients with non-A-E hepatitis
tested negative for anti-HCV and HBsAg. All blood donors
were also negative for anti-HIV. All patients with hepatitis
C were HBsAg negative.
DNA purification
DNA extraction from sera
DNA was extracted from 200 µL of serum using the
QIAamp Blood kit (QIAGEN Ltd., Crawley, UK) and dissolved in 100 µL of elution buffer (QIAGEN Ltd., Crawley,
UK). Extracted DNA was stored at -20°C.
DNA extraction from PBMCs
PBMCs were separated by centrifugation from the whole
blood on a Ficoll-Paque gradient (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO)
according to the manufacturer's protocol. PBMCs were
digested with proteinase K (100 µg/ml) (SIGMA, St. Louis,
MO) in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 1 %
Tween; 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Thereafter, proteinase K was
inactivated for 10 min at 95°C and samples were stored at
-20°C.
Polymerase chain reaction
Five microlitres of total DNA were analyzed in a PCR thermocycler PTC 200 (MJ Research, Inc, Waltham, MA). TTV
DNA detection was performed with two sets of primers. A
271 bp long fragment of the ORF1 was amplified in a
semi-nested PCR with a modified primer set designed by
Okamoto [4]. By nested PCR a 110 bp fragment was
amplified from the NCR [2]. For the first PCR with ORF1
specific primers, 50 pmol of both modified primers
NG059mod (3' CAGACAGAGGMGAAGGMAAYATG 5')
and NG063mod (3'CTGGCATYTYWCC MTTTCCAAARTT
5') were used in a 50 µl reaction mixture containing 10
mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 50 mM KCl, 0.8% Nonidet P40,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/4/56

200 µM each dNTP and 2.5 U Taq polymerase (Fermentas, Hanover, MD). Each of the 35 cycles consisted of 30 s
of denaturation at 94°C, 30 s of annealing at 58°C and 45
s of elongation at 72°C. The last cycle was followed by 7
min incubation at 72°C. One microliter of the product
from the first PCR was transferred to 50 µl reaction mixture with primers NG061 (3' GGMAAYATGYTRTGGATAGACTGG 5') and NG063mod. The reaction mixture and
cycling conditions for the second PCR were the same
except that 25 cycles were run.
For the PCR with NCR specific primers the same conditions as for ORF1 specific PCR were used. In the first PCR
we used 50 pmol of primer NG133 (3'GTAAGTGCACTTCCGAATGGCTGAG 5') and NG147 (3'GCCAGTCCCGAGCCCG AATTGCC 5'), for the second PCR 50 pmol
of primers NG134 (3'AGTTTTCCA CGCCCGTCCGCAGC
5') and NG132 (3'AGCCCGAATTGCCCCTTG AC 5').
Each of the 35 cycles of the first PCR and 25 cycles of the
second PCR consisted of 30 s of denaturation at 94°C, 30
s of annealing at 58°C and 45 s of elongation at 72°C,
with a final extension for 7 min at 72°C. Ten microlitres
of the PCR product were separated electrophoretically on
a 3% agarose gel (NuSieve 3:1, FMC BioProduct, Rockland, ME).
TTV viral load in serum and PBMCs of patients with
hemophilia
DNA extracted from sera and PBMCs of 4 patients with
hemophilia was serially diluted (in 10-fold steps) in distilled water and TTV DNA was determined by PCR with
NCR primers. The highest dilution (10N) testing positive
was used as a relative titer for determining the viral titer
per 1 ml of TTV DNA in serum and PBMCs.
Sequence analysis
A nucleotide DNA sequence of PCR ORF1 products
(selected from all groups of study subjects), which
revealed a clear band on the agarose gel, was determined.
PCR products were excised from a 3% agarose gel and
purified with MinElute Gel Extraction kit (QIAGEN Ltd.,
Crawley, UK) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Both strands of the 271 bp long products generated by
PCR with ORF1-specific primers were sequenced directly
with the NG061 and NG063mod primers using the ABI
Big Dye Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). The sequencing was performed on an ABI PRISM 310
automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA).
Phylogenetic analysis
DNA sequences (of the following accession numbers:
AY429576 – AY429589, AY433961 – AY434008,
AY456097 – AY456103, AY484597) were aligned using
the CLUSTAL X program [27] with the corresponding 222

Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed using the Fisher
exact test. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and two-tailed P values were calculated in 2 – 2

2002) and GraphPad InStat (version 3.05) (GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA). In all tests, the basic significance level was P = 0.05.

lence of TTV DNA between first-time and regular blood
donors (results not shown). The highest prevalence rates
were recorded in group 2 (at higher risk of parenteral
transmission of infection): 95% (19/20) (OR = 17.16, CI
2.25–130.73, P = 0.0002) for hemophiliacs and 91.8%
(45/49) (OR = 10.16, CI 3.52–29.34, P < 0.0001) for
IVDUs. In group 3, sex workers and promiscuous men had
a prevalence of TTV DNA comparable with that of the normal population, i.e. 62% (62/100), but penitentiary prisoners had a significantly higher prevalence of TTV DNA,
i.e. 74% (37/50) (OR = 2.38, CI 1.21–4.69, P = 0.011)
than blood donors. We detected no TTV DNA in the cord
blood samples, but children had a similar prevalence of
TTV DNA as the control group, i.e. 67.8% (141/208).
Patients in group 5 had a slightly higher prevalence of TTV
DNA than healthy blood donors, the difference being significant only for patients with hepatitis C virus infection,
i.e. 89.2% (66/74) (OR = 7.45, CI 3.40–16.3, P < 0.0001).

Results
In total, 854 samples were screened for the presence of
TTV DNA using a NCR-PCR. The TTV genotype was determined by sequencing part of the ORF1 region from 70
TTV isolates.
Prevalence of TTV DNA in different groups of subjects
The prevalence rates of TTV DNA in different groups are
shown in Table 1. The prevalence of TTV DNA in healthy

Age-specific prevalence of TTV DNA
As indicated in Figure 1, we observed a dramatic increase
in TTV-prevalence during the first two years of life (at the
age of 2 years it equaled 85.7%). The prevalence decreased
to 43.3% for 8-year-olds and started to rise again to 73.3%
in 14-year-olds. Figure 2 shows an age-dependent distribution pattern of TTV DNA prevalence in the three groups
of subjects (blood donors, a group at increased risk of sexual infection, and a combined group of patients with nonA-E hepatitis and hepatitis C). TTV prevalence showed a
tendency to increase with a significant linear trend for the
group at a higher risk of sexual transmission (Chi square
for trend= 8.002, p = 0.0047). Even although the control

TTV presence and viral load in serum and PBMCs
As indicated in Table 2 for patients with hemophilia, TTV
DNA was more often detected in serum than in PBMCs.
TTV DNA was found in sera of all patients (10/10, 100%)
and in most (7/10, 70%) PBMCs. Seven patients were
positive in serum and PBMCs samples, three subjects had
TTV DNA detectable only in serum. The amplification of
the internal control beta-globin gene was positive for all
PBMCs samples. Viral loads in PBMCs and in corresponding serum samples were compared for four hemophiliacs.
All individuals had TTV DNA titers 10 to 100 times higher
in their sera than in PBMCs.
Heterogeneity of TTV genotypes
The results of our sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
are summarized in Table 3 and Figure 3. The topography
of the tree using either the neighbour-joining or maximum likelihood method was identical. We analysed 9
samples from group 1, 23 from group 2, 15 from group 3,
10 from group 4 and 13 from group 5. According to
Okamoto's classification [2], 9 isolates were classified into
genotype G1a (2 patients with hemophilia, 3 penitentiary
prisoners, 1 child, 3 patients with hepatitis C), 18 isolates
into genotype G1b (3 blood donors, 3 IVDUs, 1 prostitute, 3 penitentiary prisoners, 4 children, 2 blood donors
with increased ALT levels and 2 patients with non-A-E
hepatitis), 18 isolates into genotype G2b (4 blood donors,
5 patients with hemophilia, 1 IVDU, 3 sex workers, 2 children, 1 blood donors with an elevated ALT level, 1 patient
with hepatitis C and 1 patient with non-A-E hepatitis), 21
isolates into genotype G2c (2 blood donors, 5 patients
with hemophilia, 3 IVDUs, 4 sex workers, 1 penitentiary
prisoner, 3 children, 2 blood donors with increased ALT
levels, 1 patient with hepatitis C), 3 isolates into genotype
G8 (3 patients with hemophilia) (Table 3) and 1 isolate
from a IVDU (I5s) was most closely related to genotype
G2. The similarity of this product with a G2a reference
genotype sequence (AB017770) was 74.8 %; its similarity
with the reference sequence of G2c (AB017768) was
73.9% on the nucleotide level. In the Czech population,
the most prevalent genotype was G2c (30.0%), followed
by G1b (25.7%), G2b (25.7%), G1a (12.9%) and G8
(4.3%). No association between any of the detected genotypes and a particular population group was revealed.
Comparison of TTV genotypes present in sera and PBMCs
of the same patient
Tree of four patients positive in both serum and PBMCs by
the ORF1 PCR system yielded a PCR product adequate for
sequencing analysis. Genotypes and sequence homologies are shown in Table 2. Two paired sequences were of
the same genotype, G2b and G2c, respectively, and the

sequence similarity between the genotype detected in
PBMCs and serum was 96.8% and 100%, respectively. In
one patient we detected genotype G8 in PBMCs and genotype G2b in serum (similarity 32.6%).
Co-infection markers in association with TTV DNA
presence
Four groups of subjects were compared for correlation of
past HBV and/or HCV infection with TTV DNA prevalence. We compared subjects at a higher risk of sexual
transmission, IVDUs, patients with hemophilia and peni-

tentiary prisoners. There was no evidence of present or
past HCV or present HBV infection in blood donors. The
prevalence of anti-HBc in blood donors in the Czech
Republic is very low (1–2%, unpublished data). These
data imply that our control group was at a low risk of sexually and parenterally acquired infections. Also all children were anti-HBc and anti-HCV negative. Both the
groups of hemophiliacs and IVDUs presented evidence of
frequent past or current HBV (50% and 22%) and HCV
(82% and 72%) infection. Thirteen percent of sex workers
and promiscuous men showed past or current HBV expo-

sure. The study subjects positive for HBV and/or HCV
markers had a significantly higher prevalence of TTV DNA
regardless of the primer set used (Table 4).

Discussion
The present study on TTV prevalence, mode of transmission and age-specific prevalence is the largest study performed in Central and East Europe. This study showed
that TTV infection is quite common among the Czech
population. The prevalence rates of TTV in blood donors
(52.6%) were similar to those found in other developed
countries (for review see [29]).
The most interesting result was the lack of TTV DNA in 54
cord blood samples, suggestive of the absence of transuterine transmission of TTV. Furthermore, we have shown
that the prevalence of TTV DNA was age dependent. In
children, we observed a dramatic increase of TTV prevalence within the first two years of age. The prevalence of

TTV further gradually increased in children aged 8 to 14
years. Similarly, Ohto et al. reported that the TTV prevalence in children at the age of 2 years was comparable with
that in mothers, while children younger than 3 months of
age were infected only exceptionally [19]. In the Czech
Republic, children start schooling at the age of six or seven
years. Based on our data, postnatal infection from mother
to child and an increased number of social contacts are
likely to be the most important routes of TTV transmission
in children.
In adults, we have shown the increase of TTV prevalence
with age irrespective of study group. Similar results have
been reported by others [21,30-33].
We observed an increased prevalence of TTV in various
groups of hepatitis patients. Since many hepatitis viruses
share the same modes of transmission, multiple viral
infections may occur in one patient [34]. Our results

showed a significantly higher prevalence of TTV infection
in patients with hepatitis C than in healthy individuals,
implying that HCV and TTV may share common modes of
transmission.
In agreement with other studies we detected the highest
prevalence of TTV in hemophiliacs and IVDUs, which
supports the importance of the parenteral route of transmission of TTV [9,35-38]. Nevertheless, the prevalence of
52.6% in blood donors and in healthy children suggests
that the higher prevalence in hemophiliacs and IVDUs
can also be attributed to a higher TTV viral load. Different
TTV concentrations of virus in hemophiliacs and blood
donors have been previously reported by Touinssi [39].
Additionally, Simmonds has shown that in hemophiliacs
the prevalence of TTV increased with the amount of clotting factor treatment received and was also dependent on
whether the blood concentrates tested had been virally
inactivated [9].
As for TTV sexual transmission, the results of our study
suggest that if TTV is sexually transmitted, this mode of
transmission is likely to be less important. Even though
13% subjects of the group at risk for sexual transmission
of TTV showed past or current HBV exposure, indicative of
high promiscuity, the prevalence of TTV was not significantly different from that of the control group (62% and
52.6%). To the best of our knowledge, so far only one
study found a significant difference in the TTV prevalence
in sex workers [40], while others did not.
In the group of penitentiary prisoners the significantly
higher prevalence of TTV seems to be most probably a
consequence of intravenous drug abuse rather than sexual
promiscuity since the prevalence of HCV was four-times
higher than in the group at risk for sexual transmission
(20% versus 5%).
An increased prevalence of TTV in non-A-E hepatitis
patients was observed in the present study in agreement
with many previous studies. Additionally, our data
showed an increased TTV prevalence in blood donors
with increased ALT levels. Several studies have shown a
correlation between TTV-titer and elevation of serum ALT
levels [24,30] but the experimental infection of chimpanzees with TTV did not show any biochemical or histological evidence of hepatitis [1].

dence of association of particular TTV genotypes with any
of the risk groups.

Conclusions
Our results demonstrated a high prevalence of TTV in the
Czech population. Our data show the absence of transuterine transmission of TTV, but postnatal route of transmission from mother to child and infection via frequent
social contacts seem to be very important modes of transmision in children. The sexual mode of transmission is
most likely to be low effective. No convincing evidence
was found to support the involvement of TTV in the
pathogenesis of hepatitis.
Our data, as well as the results of other studies, show that
optimization of the primer set for more standard TTV
detection and genotyping is still needed. Improved
serological approach to TTV detection could be of value. It
is evident that more data are still needed for a better
understanding of the natural history of TTV infection.

The heterogeneity of TTV is extreme. Because the NCR
region is too conserved for evolutionary analyses, the
ORF1 region of the TTV genome is most often used for
genotyping. Out of the 70 sequenced isolates, G2 followed by G1 were the most frequent genotypes among the
Czech population. The phylogeny analysis showed no evi-
