Background
RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) analysis is
wide used for the genetic mapping, taxonomic and phylogenetic studies of many organisms. It can be also applicable for the detection of DNA alterations after influence of
many genotoxical agents as well [1]. UV-radiation can
produce several major types of DNA lesions such as
cyclobutane-type pirimidine dimers and the 6-4 photoproducts [2]. Another important types of DNA damages
such as protein cross-links, DNA strand breaks, deletion
or insertion of base pairs can also be induced by UV-irradiation. Whereas, irradiation by γ-rays leads to the increasing level of DNA break formation. These different types of
DNA damages must be detected by changes in RAPD profiles. The aim of present study was to investigate the possibility mutation changes in plant DNA after the influence
of UV-B and γ-ray with using RAPD method. The 10-mer
primers with single nucleotide substitutions were used in
order to estimate these structural alterations in DNA following after genotoxical agents' treatment.

treatment was performed accordingly to [3]. DNA was
analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis.
RAPD amplification involved initial denaturation of DNA
template (20 ng per 25 µl reaction mix) at 94°C for 3 min,
followed by 33 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 36°C
and 2 min at 72°C in thermocycler "Tertsik" (Russia).
Amplification was finished with incubation at 72°C for 7
min. The sequences of 10-mer primers (MedBioservice)
with single base substitutions are given in Table 1.
PCR amplification products were analyzed in 2.5 % (w/v)
agarose gel in 0.5xTBE buffer. PCR products (25 µl per
sample) were mixed with 3–5 µl Gel Loading Dye Solution (Fermentas, Lithvuania) and loaded onto the agarose
gel, containing ethidium bromide (0.5 mkg/ml). Gene
Ruler 100 bp DNA ladder was used for each agarose gel.
Electrophoresis was carried out at 80 V for 3.5 h, then the
results were visualized under UV light and documented
using Canon digital camera.

Materials and methods
Approximately 0.20 g of plant tissue from alfalfa seedlings, which was irradiated by high doses of UV-B and γ –
ray (LD50) was frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground with
mortar and pestle and incubated in 1.5 ml of extraction
buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM
EDTA pH 8, 2% SDS and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K) during
1.5 h at 37°C. DNA was extracted twice with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) mixture. DNA was precipitated from the aqueous phase with 2 vol. of cold
isopropanol at -20°C during 48 h. DNA pellet was harvested by centrifugation, washed several times in 70°ethanol, air-dried and dissolved in deionized water. RNAse

Results
It was shown, that single nucleotide substitutions in 10mer primers indeed can be reflected on the amplicons'
profiles. The main changes observed in the RAPD profiles
have been resulted both in an appearance (see Figure 1) or
disappearance of different bands (see Figure 2) with variation of their intensity as well. These effects might be connected with structural rearrangements in DNA caused by
different types of DNA damages.

Thus, RFLP method is applicable for the detection of
changes in the DNA structure after different genotoxical
treatments. The variation in band intensity and
disappearance of some bands may correlate with level of
photoproducts in DNA template after genotoxical treatment, which can reduce the number of binding sites for
Taq polymerase. Appearance of new bands can be
explained as the result of different DNA structural changes
(breaks, transpositions, deletions etc). We can estimate
the existence of mutation and structural alterations in
plant DNA after impact of different stressful factors on the
bases of DNA patterns obtained after RAPD with the set of
primers. Obviously, sensitivity of the RAPD assay depends
of the mutations level and it needs further investigations.
