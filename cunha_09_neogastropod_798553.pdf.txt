Abstract
Background: The Neogastropoda is a highly diversified group of predatory marine snails
(Gastropoda: Caenogastropoda). Traditionally, its monophyly has been widely accepted based on
several morphological synapomorphies mostly related with the digestive system. However, recent
molecular phylogenetic studies challenged the monophyly of Neogastropoda due to the inclusion
of representatives of other caenogastropod lineages (e.g. Littorinimorpha) within the group.
Neogastropoda has been classified into up to six superfamilies including Buccinoidea, Muricoidea,
Olivoidea, Pseudolivoidea, Conoidea, and Cancellarioidea. Phylogenetic relationships among
neogastropod superfamilies remain unresolved.
Results: The complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes of seven Neogastropoda (Bolinus brandaris,
Cancellaria cancellata, Conus borgesi, Cymbium olla, Fusiturris similis, Nassarius reticulatus, and Terebra
dimidiata) and of the tonnoidean Cymatium parthenopeum (Littorinimorpha), a putative sister group
to Neogastropoda, were sequenced. In addition, the partial sequence of the mitochondrial genome
of the calyptraeoidean Calyptraea chinensis (Littorinimorpha) was also determined. All sequenced
neogastropod mt genomes shared a highly conserved gene order with only two instances of tRNA
gene translocation. Phylogenetic relationships of Neogastropoda were inferred based on the 13 mt
protein coding genes (both at the amino acid and nucleotide level) of all available caenogastropod
mitochondrial genomes. Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) phylogenetic
analyses failed to recover the monophyly of Neogastropoda due to the inclusion of the tonnoidean
Cymatium parthenopeum within the group. At the superfamily level, all phylogenetic analyses
questioned the taxonomic validity of Muricoidea, whereas the monophyly of Conoidea was
supported by most phylogenetic analyses, albeit weakly. All analyzed families were recovered as
monophyletic except Turridae due to the inclusion of Terebridae. Further phylogenetic analyses
based on either a four mt gene data set including two additional Littorinimorpha or combining mt
and nuclear sequence data also rejected the monophyly of Neogastropoda but rendered rather
unresolved topologies. The phylogenetic performance of each mt gene was evaluated under ML.
The total number of resolved internal branches of the reference (whole-mt genome) topology was
not recovered in any of the individual gene phylogenetic analysis. The cox2 gene recovered the
highest number of congruent internal branches with the reference topology, whereas the combined
tRNA genes, cox1, and atp8 showed the lowest phylogenetic performance.

Conclusion: Phylogenetic analyses based on complete mt genome data resolved a higher number
of internal branches of the caenogastropod tree than individual mt genes. All performed
phylogenetic analyses agreed in rejecting the monophyly of the Neogastropoda due to the inclusion
of Littorinimorpha lineages within the group. This result challenges morphological evidence, and
prompts for further re-evaluation of neogastropod morphological synapomorphies. The important
increase in number of analyzed positions with respect to previous studies was not enough to
achieve conclusive results regarding phylogenetic relationships within Neogastropoda. In this
regard, sequencing of complete mtDNAs from all closely related caenogastropod lineages is
needed. Nevertheless, the rapid radiation at the origin of Neogastropoda may not allow full
resolution of this phylogeny based only on mt data, and in parallel more nuclear sequence data will
also need to be incorporated into the phylogenetic analyses.

Background
Neogastropoda [1,2], also known as Stenoglossa [3], comprises a highly diverse group of predatory marine shelled
gastropods with more than 16,000 living species [4]
including e.g., cone snails (Conidae), balers (Volutidae),
purple dye murex snails (Muricidae), augers (Terebridae),
and whelks (Buccinidae) [5]. Neogastropoda are dominant in many benthic environments, and attain their maximum diversity in the tropical seas [6,7]. The most
prominent feature of Neogastropoda is their active predatory behavior (most species are carnivorous), which was
achieved after important morphological changes including e.g., the elongation of the siphonal canal, a shift in the
mouth opening to a terminal position on the head, and
the formation of a well-developed proboscis [5,8-10].
Ever since Thiele [1], Neogastropoda have been considered a natural group, clearly differentiated from other
Caenogastropoda. The monophyly of the group is widely
accepted among morphologists [5], and it is based on several synapomorphies mostly related with the anatomy of
the digestive system [5,8,10-13]. Current classifications of
Neogastropoda generally recognize up to six superfamilies: Buccinoidea, Muricoidea, Olivoidea, Pseudolivoidea, Conoidea, and Cancellarioidea [1,2,8,12,14]
(Additional file 1). Phylogenetic relationships among
neogastropod superfamilies based on morphological
characters are rather unstable, and for instance, Cancellarioidea [8] or Buccinoidea [5] have been alternatively proposed as the sister group of the remaining Neogastropoda.
Thus far, molecular phylogenetic analyses based on relatively short fragments of both nuclear and mitochondrial
(mt) DNA recovered rather unresolved topologies, which
contradicted morphological evidence, and failed to support the monophyly of Neogastropoda [15-20]. For
instance, the most complete molecular phylogenetic
study thus far performed on this subject [21] was based on
a multigene data set that included both nuclear (18S
rRNA, 28S rRNA, EF1-α, and Histone H3; 2,707 bp) and
mt (cox1 and 12S rRNA; 1,288 bp) sequences of 29 Cae-

nogastropoda. The reconstructed tree failed to recover the
monophyly of Neogastropoda, and two Littorinimorpha
lineages (Tonnoidea and Calyptraeoidea) were recovered
as the closest sister groups of two Neogastropoda lineages
(Volutidae and Cancellariidae, respectively), although
with low statistical support. In contrast, more recently, a
phylogenetic analysis combining both morphological,
and molecular data (using the same genes as in [21])
recovered Neogastropoda as monophyletic [5] stimulating the debate.
The available fossil record of Neogastropoda is quite thorough, and supports a widely accepted evolutionary scenario of an Early Cretaceous origin of the group followed
by two rapid diversification rounds in the late Cretaceous
and the Paleocene, respectively [22-24]. The successive
bursts of cladogenesis in the evolutionary history of the
group could be hampering successful recovery of phylogenetic relationships within the group. Given the relatively
short internodes connecting main superfamilies of
Neogastropoda and related caenogastropod lineages, it
seems worthwhile gathering and analyzing larger
sequence data sets in order to obtain more phylogenetic
informative sites for trying to resolve the question at
hand.
Phylogenetic analyses based on complete mt sequence
data have proved to enhance resolution, and statistical
confidence of inferred phylogenetic trees in vertebrates
when compared with analyses based only on partial mt
genes [25-27]. Within gastropods, mitogenomic data have
demonstrated to be useful in recovering phylogenetic relationships within opisthobranchs (sea slugs), and in demonstrating the non-monophyly of pulmonates (snails)
[28]. Moreover, gastropod mitochondrial genomes show
a wide variety of gene arrangements, which, if sharedderived, could be used to infer phylogenetic relationships
[5,28]. Hence, sequencing and analyzing mt genome data
seems to be a promising tool for further addressing the
controversy on neogastropod monophyly and phylogenetic relationships. Nevertheless, it is important to note

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/210

that phylogenetic analyses based on mt genomes show
limitations (particularly when addressing deep phylogenetic relationships but not only), and can render odd
results that are incongruent with other evidences [29-31].
Unorthodox phylogenetic relationships based on mt
genome data can be explained as artefacts due to e.g.
incorrect rooting [32] or low signal-to-noise ratio [33],
but are difficult to correct. Hence, it is widely accepted that
phylogenetic results derived from mt genome data need to
be confirmed with evidence based on nuclear genes,
which have a slower evolutionary rate, and may show in
some cases better phylogenetic performance (e.g. [34]).
Thus far, however, only few nuclear markers such as e.g.
18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, EF1-α, and Histone H3 have been
developed for phylogenetic studies in gastropods with
limited success [15,16,20,21].
To date, only five entire mt genomes of Neogastropoda
have been determined: Conus textile NC_009797, [35];
Lophiotoma cerithiformis NC_008098, [36]; Ilyanassa obsoleta NC_007781, [37], Thais clavigera NC_010090[38] and
Rapana venosa NC_011193[39]. These mt genomes represent only two (Conoidea and Buccinoidea) out of the six
currently recognized superfamilies of Neogastropoda.
Moreover, no mt genomes are available for any of the
putative caenogastropod sister group lineages of Neogastropoda.
In this study, we sequenced the entire mt genome of
another seven neogastropod species that represent four
out of the six currently recognized superfamilies (Muricoidea, Buccinoidea, Cancellarioidea, and Conoidea), as well
as a representative of Tonnoidea (Littorinimorpha), one
of the proposed sister groups to the Neogastropoda
[11,40-42]. In addition, we sequenced a fragment of
approximately 8,500 base pairs of the mt genome of a representative of Calyptraeoidea (Littorinimorpha), another

potentially closely related taxon of Neogastropoda [21].
The new sequence data were used (both at the amino acid
and nucleotide level) to reconstruct the phylogeny of
Neogastropoda, and test its monophyly. The phylogenetic
performance of individual mt genes was also investigated,
and compared with that of whole mt genomes. In addition, evolution of mitochondrial gene arrangements
within Gastropoda was revisited in the light of the new mt
genomic data.

Results
Mitochondrial genome organization
The complete mt genomes of seven neogastropods (Bolinus brandaris, Cancellaria cancellata, Conus borgesi, Cymbium olla, Fusiturris similis, Nassarius reticulatus, and Terebra
dimidiata) and of Cymatium parthenopeum (Littorinimorpha:Tonnoidea) were sequenced. The total lengths of the
new sequences ranged between 15,270 and 16,648 bp
(Table 1). All newly sequenced complete mt genomes
encoded for 13 protein-coding, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA),
and two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. All neogastropod
mt genomes shared the same gene order with only two
exceptions (Fig. 1): (1) the trnS (ucn) gene from Fusiturris
similis was positioned between nad6 and cob genes,
whereas in the other neogastropod mt genomes is found
between cob and trnT; (2) the position of the trnV in Terebra dimidiata was located between trnS (ucn) and trnT,
whereas in the other neogastropod mt genomes is found
between both rRNA genes. The mt genome of the tonnoidean Cymatium parthenopeum presented the neogastropod
mt genome consensus gene order (Fig. 1). The partial
sequence of the mt genome of Calyptraea chinensis (Littorinimorpha: Calyptraeoidea) was 8,530 bp in length,
and comprised 25 out of the 37 mt genes. The deduced
gene order of this partial mt genome was consistent with
the neogastropod mt genome consensus gene order (from
trnK to trnL (uur)) (Fig. 1). Moreover, the gene order of the

partial sequence of Littorina saxatilis (Littorinomorpha:
Littorinoidea) mt genome, which is available in GenBank
(AJ_132137, [43], is also consistent with the neogastropod mt genome consensus gene order (from cox1 to cob)
(Fig. 1).
All genes of the newly sequenced complete mt genomes
used ATG as start codon except nad4, which used other
start codons (ATA in Bolinus brandaris, Nassarius reticulatus,
and Cymbium olla, ATT in Cancellaria cancellata and Conus
borgesi, and TTG in Fusiturris similis, Cymatium parthenopeum, and Terebra dimidiata). In these mt genomes, only
eigth out of 296 genes ended with incomplete stop
codons (notably nad4 gene in Fusiturris similis, Nassarius
reticulatus, and Terebra dimidiata). Two noncoding regions
were found in all analyzed mitochondrial genomes
between trnF and cox3 (14 – 848 bp in length), and
between atp6 and trnM (27 – 44 bp in length). Another
two noncoding regions were found in all analyzed mt
genomes except Cancellaria cancellata between cox1 and
cox2 (15 – 132 bp in length), and between cox3 and trnK

(12 – 83 bp in length). In addition, a large noncoding
region located between nad1 and trnP (869 bp in length)
was found in Cancellaria cancellata. The potential origin of
replication was located between trnF and cox3 (15 – 848
bp in length) by comparison with other gastropod mt
genomes. Instances of overlapping between adjacent
genes occurred in all newly sequenced mt genomes (Table
1). The cox2 and trnD genes overlap in every genome
except that of Calyptraea chinensis whereas trnW and trnQ
overlap in every genome except that of Cymbium olla.
Overall base compositions of the newly sequenced mt
genomes are shown in Table 1.
Phylogenetic relationships of Neogastropoda based on

both at the amino acid (13-protein data set) and nucleotide (allnuc data set) level using Lottia digitalis (Patellogastropoda), and Haliotis rubra (Vetigastropoda) as
outgroups, respectively. Both data sets were analyzed

monophyly of the superfamily Muricoidea (Fig. 2). The
status of other neogastropod superfamilies could not be
tested in the present study since only one family represented them. Internal branches connecting neogastropod
families were rather short, and phylogenetic relationships
among superfamilies were rather unresolved. Only the relative most basal position of Cancellarioidea with respect
to other superfamilies was strongly supported by both,
ML and BI analyses (Fig. 2). At a lower taxonomic level,
the monophyly of all analyzed neogastropod families was
strongly supported by the 13-protein data set with the
exception of Turridae, which was strongly rejected (90%

Both, the ML (-LnL = 46918.42) and the BI (-LnL =

Neogastropoda (Fig. 2) due to the inclusion of Cymatium
parthenopeum (Littorinimorpha: Tonnoidea) within the
group with strong support (74% bootstrap support (BP),
and 100% Bayesian posterior probability (BPP), respectively). The monophyly of the superfamily Conoidea was
only recovered in the BI analysis (with maximal support;

Connoidea as a monophyletic group but without strong

from the analysis (not shown). Phylogenetic relationships
among superfamilies were largely unresolved in the
reconstructed tree based on the allnuc data set (Fig. 3).

Phylogenetic relationships within Caenogastropoda were
also analyzed based on complete mt genome nucleotide
sequence data (allnuc data set). Neogastropoda were not
recovered as a monophyletic group due to the inclusion of
the tonnoidean Cymatium parthenopeum, which was
placed as sister group of Cancellariidae in both, ML (-lnL

when third codon positions of all protein coding genes

largely unresolved, and monophyly at the superfamily
level could not be recovered.

partial mt genome sequences
To further test the monophyly of Neogastropoda, we analyzed a 4-protein data set that included two extra Littorinimorpha species (Calyptraea chinensis and Littorina
saxatilis), using Lottia digitalis as outgroup (see Material
and Methods). Both, the ML (-Ln L = 12497.47) and BI (Ln L = 12694.60) reconstructed trees could not recover the
monophyly neither of Neogastropoda nor of Littorinimorpha, albeit these results lacked statistical support (Fig.

protein and all nuc data sets (Figs. 2 and 3). They only differed in the relative phylogenetic position of Conidae,
(Fig. 5A versus Figs. 2 and 3). The nucleotide sequences of
the genes of the four mt protein data set were also combined with partial sequences of four nuclear genes [21]
into a single data set (partial combined). The reconstructed ML (-lnL = 52671.57) and BI (-lnL = 51166.67)
trees were rather unresolved. Among analyzed Littorinimorpha lineages, Littorinidae and Calyptraeidae were
recovered in a relative basal position, and only Ranellidae
(Tonnoidea) was placed within Neogastropoda, as sister
group of Cancellariidae (Fig. 5B). Conoidea was recovered
as a monophyletic group, although without statistical
support.
Testing alternative phylogenetic hypotheses
Given that phylogenetic analyses based on the most
resolving (13-protein) data set failed to recover consistently the monophyly of several traditional morphological
groups including Neogastropoda, Conoidea, Muricoidea,
and Turridae, we further tested their validity evaluating
different alternative topologies (Additional file 2). We
also tested several alternative phylogenetic hypotheses on
neogastropod relationships previously reported in the literature (Additional file 2; [8,9,21]). Alternative topologies
were built imposing constraints on the ML topology (Fig.
2). For instance, the monophyly of Neogastropoda was
imposed by forcing the tonnoidean to be positioned in a
basal position with respect to the remaining Neogastrop-

oda, and by keeping identical all remaining phylogenetic
relationships as recovered in the ML tree.
The SH, AU and KH tests rejected the following alternative
topologies: (1) the ML hypothesis of Colgan (topology
adapted from Fig. Four of Colgan et al., 2007); (2) the
morphology-based phylogeny of Kantor [8], and (3)
monophyly of Neogastropoda, and all analyzed superfamilies/families within the group. In contrast, several
alternative topologies were found to be not significantly
different from the ML tree: (1) the monophyly of Conoidea; (2) the morphology-based phylogeny adapted from
Ponder and Lindberg [9]; (3) the monophyly of Turridae,
and (4) the monophyly of Muricoidea (Additional file 2).
Finally, it is noteworthy that the monophyly of Neogastropoda was rejected under the AU and KH tests but not
by the SH test (Additional file 2).
Phylogenetic performance of mitochondrial genes
ML phylogenies were reconstructed at the nucleotide level
based on each of the mt protein-coding (including all
codon positions), each the two rRNA genes, and a combined data set including all mt tRNA genes. The number
of congruent internal branches (i.e. nodes) between the
individual phylogenies, and the whole-mt genome topology (Fig. 3) was used as a measure of the phylogenetic performance of mt genes (Table 3). None of the individual
gene analysis recovered the 12 nodes (A-L) of the reference topology (Table 3 and Fig. 3). Individual genes typically recovered between 2–5, and 0–6 congruent nodes to
the reference topology with bootstrap supports above/
equal or below 50%, respectively. The three nodes (F, H,
and L) were consistently recovered by most genes whereas
others (A-D, G, I, J) were recovered only by 1–2 genes. The
cox2, atp6, and nad4 genes recovered the highest number
of congruent nodes, whereas the combined tRNA genes
cox1, and atp8 showed the lowest phylogenetic performance.

Discussion
Monophyly of Neogastropoda
Recent molecular phylogenetic analyses (e.g. [28]) are
challenging our view of gastropod systematics and many
traditional groups (e.g. Pulmonata), widely accepted as
monophyletic, are now seriously questioned [44-46]. As a
result, a general perception is emerging that many morphological characters previously used to infer phylogenetic relationships among gastropod main lineages may
be homoplasious [13,28], and that gastropod phylogeny
needs to be revisited. For instance, our phylogenetic analyses recover Vetigastropoda as the closest living sister
group to Caenogastropoda with strong quantitative support. This result challenges the traditional hypothesis that
proposes Heterobranchia (i.e. the paraphyletic Heterostropha, together with Opisthobranchia and Pulmonata)

as the sister group to Caenogastropoda [5,9,47,48]. The
addition of nuclear data is needed to further confirm these
new phylogenetic hypotheses.
Despite their remarkable present diversity, neogastropods
have been traditionally recognized as a natural group
because they share several key morphological features
[1,5,10,11,24]. For instance, a recent phylogeny of Caenogastropoda based on 55 taxa and 164 morphological
characters (particularly of external anatomy and eusperm)
recovered neogastropods as a monophyletic group with
maximal support [5]. In contrast, molecular phylogenetic
studies have generally rendered rather unresolved caenogastropod phylogenies that challenged, albeit weakly,

the widely accepted monophyly of Neogastropoda (e.g.
[19,21]).
The molecular phylogenetic analyses performed in this
study recovered different Littorinimorpha species (Cymatium parthenopeum, Calyptraea chinensis, and Littorina saxatilis) within Neogastropoda, thus questioning the
monophyly of both main caenogastropod lineages. However, among these results, only the inclusion of the tonnoidean species Cymatium parthenopeum within
Neogastropoda in the phylogeny based on the 13-protein
data set received strong quantitative support (and was further confirmed by the AU and KH tests). Depending on
the data set, Tonnoidea has been placed as closely related

to Neogastropoda (e.g based on morphology+molecules;
[5]), or within Neogastropoda in a relatively basal position either alone (based on the 13-protein and all combined data sets; this study), as sister group of Volutidae
(based on partial mt and nuclear genes; [21]), or as sister
group of Cancellariidae (based on the allnuc, 4-protein,
and partial combined data sets; this study).
The unresolved conflict on the monophyly of Neogastropoda between morphological and molecular phylogenies
suggests either that shared morphological characters of
Neogastropoda are homoplasious (convergent or plesiomorphic) or that, thus far, the analyzed molecular data
sets were not informative enough for resolving the phylogenetic question at hand. Regarding the possibility that
morphological homoplasy is commonplace in gastropods, recent studies on the embryonic development of the
valve of Leiblein (a gland that acts as an oesophageal valve
binding together food particles) in Buccinidae [49] and
Muricidae [12,40] demonstrated different origins of this
organ in both neogastropod families. These findings indicated that this synapomorphy of Neogastropoda could be
uncertain [50], and prompt for the re-evaluation of other
synapomorphies defining Neogastropoda.

Regarding the possibility that molecular data sets need to
be improved, the phylogenetic analyses performed here
show that the effort in increasing the number of analyzed
positions with respect to previous studies was not enough
to achieve conclusive results regarding phylogenetic relationships within Neogastropoda. Internal branches connecting main caenogastropod/neogastropod lineages
were relatively short. Such phylogenetic pattern is in
agreement with the fossil record, which supports a rapid
radiation at the origin of Neogastropoda [11,24]. Therefore, it would be expected low resolution at this part of the
caenogastropod tree regardless of the amount of sampled
characters (but observe the increase in resolution in the
ML tree based on 13-protein data set with respect to that
based on the 4-protein data set, and to the individual phylogenetic analyses – see below). It is also noteworthy that
internal branches in the phylogenetic tree based on the
13-protein data set (Fig. 2) presented higher bootstrap
support than the ones in the phylogenetic tree based on
the allnuc data set (Fig. 3). This result is in agreement with
the preferential use of amino acids to reconstruct deep
phylogenies because they (1) have a larger character-state
space compare to nucleotides, (2) show a slower rate of
evolution compare to silent substitutions, and (3) are less

influenced by compositional bias [51]; [26]; [52]. Our
phylogenetic analyses show that addressing the question
on the monophyly of Neogastropoda is tightly connected
with resolving phylogenetic relationships among Caenogastropoda main lineages, and hence that future phylogenetic studies based on complete mitochondrial
genome sequence data will require a thorough representation of all Caenogastropoda main lineages.
Phylogenetic relationships within Neogastropoda
All phylogenetic analyses agreed on the monophyly of the
different analyzed neogastropod families except Turridae
(due to the inclusion of Terebridae). A recent molecular
study [53] based on partial mitochondrial and nuclear
genes, and a rather thorough sampling of both families
also supported this view. At higher taxonomic levels, the
phylogenetic analysis of the different data sets rendered
(1) rather unresolved topologies; (2) showed markedly
different phylogenetic relationships based on each data
set, and (3) failed to recover the monophyly of neogastropod superfamilies. Only the phylogeny based on the 13protein data achieved some degree of resolution regarding
superfamily phylogenetic relationships. According to this
phylogeny, Cancellarioidea occupies a basal position with
respect to remaining neogastropods. This basal position
was already suggested in some previous morphological
studies [8,54]. In particular, it has been shown that the
gland of Leiblein is separated from the oesophagus in all
neogastropods but Cancellarioidea, which retains the
primitive condition [8,12]. Other phylogenetic studies
recovered Buccinoidea or Nassariidae+Mitridae as the
most basal neogastropod superfamily based on morphology or combined morphological + molecular data sets,
respectively [5]. A phylogeny based on partial mt and
nuclear genes [21] recovered a basal politomy at this level
of the caenogastropod tree, and leaved the controversy
unsettled since either Volutidae (as sister group of Tonnoidea) or Cancellariidae (as sister group of Calyptraeidae) could be the most basal neogastropod lineages.

Both, ML and BI trees based on the 13-protein data set
suggest that the monophyly of the superfamily Muricoidea is doubtful because Muricidae and Volutidae are not
recovered together. All performed phylogenetic analyses
based on other data sets also failed to recover Muricoidea
as a monophyletic group. This result was already suggested in several previous studies [5,15,21]. The status of
the superfamily Conoidea remains uncertain. The BI tree
based on the 13-protein data set (not shown), as well as
ML and BI trees based on the allnuc data set recovered the
families Turridae, Terebridae and Conidae together, albeit
with no strong statistical support. ML based on the 13protein data set fail to recover the monophyly of Conoidea but this hypothesis could not be confidently rejected
by statistical tests. Overall, our results indicate that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/210

neogastropod relationships are far from being settled (in
"a state of flux" as described by [5]).
Phylogenetic performance of mitochondrial genes
The relative merit of the different genes in recovering a
phylogeny is associated with their respective substitution
rates, and thus the taxonomic level at which higher resolution is achieved. Several studies evaluated the phylogenetic performance of mt genes in recovering vertebrate
phylogeny [25-27,55]. According to these studies, nad4
and nad5 were ranked generally as the best performing mt
genes, whereas atp8, nad6, and nad4L genes revealed the
lowest phylogenetic performance. In this study, we evaluated the phylogenetic performance of individual mt genes
in recovering caenogastropod phylogeny, and found
some remarkable differences when compared with results
from the above-mentioned studies in vertebrates. The
gene cox2 showed the largest number of congruent
branches with the whole-genome reference topology,
whereas it was never recovered as having the best phylogenetic performance in vertebrates [25-27,55]. In our study,
the mt tRNA genes showed the lowest performance,
whereas in Mueller [27] these genes demonstrated a
medium ability to recover the reference topology. The mt
gene cox1 also showed a very low performance in recovering caenogastropod phylogeny, whereas it was ranked as
a good gene for recovering the expected vertebrate tree. All
studies agreed in pointing mt atp8 as having low phylogenetic performance. In any case, combining all mt genes
into a single data set always rendered the most resolved
trees, supporting the use of complete mt genome data for
addressing caenogatropod phylogeny.
Evolution of mitochondrial gene order of Neogastropoda
Shared mt gene orders may be useful for phylogenetic
inference particularly at higher taxonomic levels [56].
Gastropods exhibit an important degree of variation in mt
gene organization compared with other animals [28,5759]. Main events of gene rearrangement occurred at the
origin of Patellogastropoda and Heterobranchia, whereas
fewer changes occurred between cephalopods (here represented by Octopus) and the ancestors of Vetigastropoda
(only tRNAs D, C and N) and Caenogastropoda (a large
single inversion, and translocations of the tRNAs D and
N). Within Heterobranchia, gene order seems to be relatively conserved and gene rearrangements are mostly
related with transposition of tRNA genes [28]. All eight
genomes sequenced in this study exhibit an unusually
conserved gene order only contradicted by two unrelated
tRNA translocations found in Fusiturris similis and Terebra
dimidiata (Fig. 1). Given the high rates of gene rearrangement among gastropod main lineages, the conserved gene
order found between all neogastropod and Littorinimorpha mt genomes suggests a shared evolutionary history
between the analyzed lineages.

Conclusion
As more molecular data are analyzed, the monophyly and
phylogenetic relationships of Neogastropoda are emerging as rather elusive evolutionary questions to be resolved.
This is likely due to a rapid origin of Neogastropoda lineages back into the Early Cretaceous. Our phylogenetic
analyses based on mt genome sequence data confirm previous molecular studies that contradicted the monophyly
of Neogastropoda. This group used to be considered wellsupported based on several morphological synapomorphies [5,8,10,11,60]. However, recent studies question
the validity of some of these synapomorphies suggesting
that Neogastropoda could be an assembly of taxa erroneously grouped on the basis of convergent morphological
characters [50]. If confirmed, molecular data may become
particularly useful for determining the Caenogastropoda
phylogeny. In this regard, future studies testing the monophyly of Neogastropoda based on mt genome sequence
data will need to include a thorough sampling of main
caenogastropod lineages. Our ML and BI analyses based
on the 13-protein data set, produced topologies better
resolved than previous studies using fragments of nuclear
and mt sequence data. Moreover, results of phylogenetic
performance indicated that none of the individual mt
genes recovered the whole-genome reference ML tree,
which may indicate that larger data sets may provide more
informative sites for this particular phylogenetic question.
However, in parallel to the steady accumulation of new
mt genome data, new nuclear data (e.g., Expressed
Sequence Tags – ESTs) need also to be gathered, and only
the combination of both types of sequence data might
render better results.

Methods
Taxon sampling
To assess phylogenetic relationships within Neogastropoda, the entire mt genome was sequenced in the following
species representing four out of the six currently recognized neogastropod superfamilies. Bolinus brandaris (L.,
1758) and Cymbium olla (L., 1758) both belonging to the
superfamily Muricoidea; Nassarius reticulatus (L., 1758)
(superfamily Buccinoidea); Cancellaria cancellata (L.,
1767) (superfamily Cancellarioidea), and Fusiturris similis
(Bivona, 1838), Conus borgesi [61], and Terebra dimidiata
(L., 1758), all belonging to superfamily Conoidea.

In order to test the monophyly of Neogastropoda, the mt
genomes of two species belonging to the closely related
order Littorinimorpha (Caenogastropoda) were also
sequenced: Cymatium parthenopeum (von Salis, 1793)
(superfamily Tonnoidea) and Calyptraea chinensis (L.,
1758) (superfamily Calyptraeoidea). The mt genome of
the former species was sequenced completely, whereas
only about 8,500 bp were sequenced from the mtDNA of
Calyptraea chinensis due to unsuccessful PCR amplification

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/210

of the remaining portion of the genome. A similar case of
partial mt genome sequencing due to failed PCR amplification was reported for Littorina saxatilis [43]).
In addition, we included in the phylogenetic analyses the
following gastropod entire mt genomes that are available
in GenBank: (1) superfamily Conoidea:Conus textile
(NC_009797, [35] and Lophiotoma cerithiformis
(NC_008098, [36]); (2) superfamily Buccinoidea: Ilyanassa obsoleta (NC_007781, [37]); (3) superfamily Muricoidea: Thais clavigera (NC_010090[38]), and Rapana
venosa (NC_011193[39]), (4) Opisthobranchia: Aplysia
californica (NC_005827, [62]) and Roboastra europaea
(NC_004321, [57]); (5) Pulmonata: Albinaria coerulea
(NC_001761, [63]); (6) Vetigastropoda: Haliotis rubra
(NC_005940, [64]), and (7) Patellogastropoda: Lottia digitalis (NC_007782, [37]). A partial fragment of Littorina
saxatilis (Litorinimorpha: Littorinoidea; AJ_132137, [43])
mt genome available in GenBank was also included in
some phylogenetic analyses.
PCR amplification and sequencing
Total DNA was extracted using either a standard phenolchloroform DNA extraction protocol with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) [65], or commercial extraction kits (DNA Easy extraction Kit, Qiagen; ChargeSwitch
gDNA Micro Tissue Kit, Invitrogen). Several pairs of primers (see Additional file 3) were used to amplify by PCR,
contiguous and overlapping fragments that covered the
entire mt genomes. PCR amplifications were carried out
with the PCR Extender System (5 Prime) in 25 μl reactions
containing 10× PCR Extender buffer, 0.2 mM of each
dNTP, 2 mM of MgCl2, 0.2 μM of each primer, 1–2 μl of
template DNA, and Taq DNA polymerase (1 unit). The
following general profile was used: an initial denaturing
step at 94°C for 2 min; 35 to 40 cycles of denaturing at
94°C for 20 s, annealing at 42–55°C for 20 s, and extending at 68°C for 60 s per kb; and a final extending step at
68°C for 7 min.

PCR amplicons were purified by ethanol precipitation.
Those fragments with sizes < 2500 bp were either directly
sequenced with the corresponding PCR primers or cloned
into pGEM-T Easy Vector System (Promega), and
sequenced with modified universal M13 primers (see
Additional file 3). Longer PCR products were directly
sequenced using a primer walking strategy. Sequencing
was performed in an automated sequencer (ABI PRISM
3700) using the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems), and following manufacturer's instructions. The obtained sequences averaged 900
bp in length, and each sequence overlapped the next contig by about 150 bp. In no case were differences observed
between overlapping regions.

Phylogenetic analyses
Gene annotation was performed by sequence comparison
with other mt genomes of gastropods. Open reading
frames helped to delimit start and stop codons of the protein coding genes. Cloverleaf secondary structures of all
tRNAs were reconstructed either by hand or with TRNASCAN-SE 1.21 [66]. Ribosomal RNA limits were based on
the boundaries of the flanking genes. The new sequences
reported in this paper have been deposited at GenBank
under accession numbers EU827194 (Bolinus brandaris),
EU827195 (Cancellaria cancellata), EU827199 (Cymbium
olla), EU827197 (Fusiturris similis), EU827201 (Nassarius
reticulatus), EU827196 (Terebra dimidiata), EU827198
(Conus borgesi), EU827200 (Cymatium parthenopeum), and
EU827193 (Calyptraea chinensis).

Separate alignments of the nucleotide and deduced amino
acid sequences of each mt protein-coding gene were constructed with CLUSTAL X version 1.83 using default parameters [67], and verified by eye in order to maximize
positional homology. Alignment ambiguities were
excluded from phylogenetic analyses using GBLOCKS version 0.91b [68,69]. Five different data sets (available from
the authors upon request) were analyzed: (1) 13-protein
data set: the deduced amino acid sequences of the 13 protein-coding mt genes of the 12 available Neogastropoda,
two Opisthobranchia (Aplysia californica and Roboastra
europaea), one Pulmonata (Albinaria coerulea), one Vetigastropoda (Haliotis rubra). and one Patellogastropoda
(Lottia digitalis) complete mt genomes were concatenated
into a single data set. The alignment consisted of 3,170
positions, of which 935 were constant, and 1,542 were
parsimony informative; (2) allnuc data set: the nucleotide sequences of the rRNA, tRNA and protein-coding
genes of all available complete mt genomes of neogastropods, one Ranellidae, and one Vetigastropoda, were concatenated into a single data set of 14,156 positions. Of
these, 5,371 positions were constant, and 6,407 were parsimony informative; (3) 4-protein data set: the available
partial mitochondrial genome sequences of two caenogastropod taxa, Littorina saxatilis (AJ_132137[43]) and Calyptraea chinensis (this study) only have in common four
protein-coding mitochondrial genes (cox1; cox2; atp6, and
atp8). The deduced amino acid sequences of these four
genes from these two taxa together with those of the taxa
included in the 13-protein data set were concatenated into
a single data set, which produced an alignment of 982
positions. Of these, 366 were constant, and 408 were parsimony informative; (4) allcombined data set: the nucleotide sequences of the rRNA, tRNA and protein-coding
genes of complete mt genomes of seven neogastropods
(Muricidae, Cancellariidae, Volutidae, Turridae, Nassariidae, Terebridae, and Conidae), one Ranellidae, and one
Vetigastropoda, all from this study, combined with partial
sequences of the nuclear genes 28S rRNA, 18S rRNA, his-

tone H3, and elongation factor 1α (nuclear sequences
retrieved from GenBank from the study of Colgan et al,
2007) were concatenated into a single data set of 16,937
positions. Of these, 7,996 were constant and 5,550 were
parsimony informative; (5) partial combined data set:
the nucleotide sequences of 4 protein-coding genes (cox1;
cox2; atp6, and atp8) of seven neogastropods (Muricidae,
Cancellariidae, Volutidae, Turridae, Nassariidae, Terebridae, and Conidae), one Ranellidae, and one Vetigastropoda, all from this study, combined with partial sequences
of the nuclear genes 28S rRNA, 18S rRNA, histone H3, and
elongation factor 1α (nuclear sequences retrieved from
GenBank from the study of Colgan et al., 2007) were concatenated into a single data set of 8,462 positions. Of
these, 4,113 are constant and 2,523 were parsimonyinformative.
The best-fit models of evolution for the amino acid and
nucleotide sequence data sets were selected using the
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [70] with PROTTEST
v1.3 [71] and MODELTEST v.3.7 [72], respectively (see
Table 2). ML trees were inferred based on the different
data sets with PHYML v3.0 [73]. The robustness of the
inferred trees was tested using non-parametric bootstrapping (BP) of 500 pseudoreplicates.
BI trees were inferred based on the different data sets with
MRBAYEs v3.1.2 [74]. Four Metropolis-coupled Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses were run for 1 million generations, and sampled every 100 generations. The
mixed model option was used for the amino acid
sequence data sets. For the analysis of nucleotide
sequence data sets, all 13 protein-coding genes, ribosomal
RNAs, and tRNAs were considered as three different partitions in the allnuc data set. A fourth partition of nuclear
genes was considered in the combined data sets. The
option (preset = variable) that allows rates to differ across
partitions was used with the "unlink" command. Burn-in
included the first 100,000 generations for the 13-protein,
all combined, and partial combined data sets, whereas the
first 50,000 generations were discarded for the 4-protein,
and allnuc data sets. Statistical support was assessed using
Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPPs).
In order to evaluate alternative hypotheses on neogastropod phylogenetic relationships found in the literature, the
approximately unbiased (AU) [75], the Kishino-Hasegawa (KH) [76], and the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) [77]
tests were performed based on the 13-protein data set.
These tests are implemented in CONSEL v0.1i [78] and
use log-likelihoods of site-patterns of the trees estimated
with PAML v.4 [79].

Phylogenetic performance of mt genes
In order to determine whether the allnuc data set had better phylogenetic performance than individual mt genes,
ML analyses were performed with PHYML v2.4.4 [73].
Individual analyses were based on each of the 13 individual mt protein-coding genes, each of the two mt ribosomal genes, and mt tRNAs (all mt tRNAs were
concatenated into a single data set). The best-fit models
and parameters for each of these data sets were estimated
under the AIC [70] as implemented in MODELTEST v.3.7
[72]. The robustness of the inferred trees was tested using
BPs of 500 pseudoreplicates. Following Mueller [27], we
compared the number of resolved nodes in each of the
50% bootstrap consensus ML trees that were inferred
based on individual gene analyses to the number of
resolved nodes in the 50% bootstrap consensus ML topology (Fig. 3) that was reconstructed based on the allnuc
data set, as a measure of phylogenetic performance of the
different individual data sets.
