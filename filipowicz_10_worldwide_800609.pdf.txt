The worldwide holoparasitic Apodanthaceae
confidently placed in the Cucurbitales by nuclear
and mitochondrial gene trees
Natalia Filipowicz†, Susanne S Renner*†

Abstract
Background: Of the c. 450 families of flowering plants, only two are left “unplaced” in the most recent APG
classification of angiosperms. One of these is the Apodanthaceae, a clade of c. 19 holoparasitic species in two or
three genera occurring in North and South America, Africa, the Near East, and Australia. Because of lateral gene
transfer between Apodanthaceae and their hosts it has been difficult to infer the family’s true closest relatives.
Results: Here we report a phylogenetic analysis of 16 accessions representing six species of Apodanthaceae from
the United States, Chile, Iran, and Australia, using the mitochondrial matR gene and the nuclear 18S gene. Data
matrices include 190 matR sequences from up to 95 families in 39 orders of flowering plants and 197 18S
sequences from 101 families representing the 16 orders of rosids. Analyses were performed at the nucleotide and
at the amino acid level. Both gene trees agree with angiosperm phylogenies found in other studies using more
genes. Apodanthaceae and the seven families of the order Cucurbitales form a clade with 100% bootstrap support
from matR and 56% from 18 S. In addition, the Apodanthaceae and Cucurbitales matR gene sequences uniquely
share two non-synonymous codon changes and one synonymous change, as well as a codon insertion, already
found by Barkman et al. (2007).
Conclusions: Apodanthaceae belong in the Cucurbitales with which they share inferior ovaries, parietal
placentation and a dioecious mating system, traits that are ancestral in Cucurbitales and which can now be
interpreted as possible synapomorphies of an enlarged order Cucurbitales. The occurrence of Apodanthaceae in
the Americas, Africa, the Near East, and Australia, and their adaptation to distantly related host species in the
Fabaceae and Salicaceae suggest a long evolutionary history.

Background
Among the c. 450 families of angiosperms [1] are about
11 parasitic lineages [2] of which some have completely
lost the ability to photosynthesize. Such non-photosynthetic parasites grow embedded within the host tissues
(as endoparasites) and emerge only during sexual reproduction [3]. Molecular-phylogenetic studies in recent
years have revealed the sister groups of most parasitic
plants [e. g. [2,4-10]. Only the Apodanthaceae and the
likewise holoparasitic Cynomoriaceae have not yet been
placed with confidence, and the Apodanthaceae are also
the only unplaced family-level clade in the latest

classification of flowering plants [1,11]. Before the
advent of large-scale molecular sequencing and until
about 2004, Apodanthaceae were considered to belong
in the order Rafflesiales, together with Rafflesiaceae,
Cytinaceae and Mitrastemonaceae [12,13], mainly based
on few or solitary, rather large to very large flowers with
a single set of tepals that are commonly united into a
conspicuous, corolloid calyx.
The aerial portions of Apodanthaceae consist of very
short flowering shoots, each with a single flower that
bursts out of the host’s cortex during development [13].
Flowers are less than a centimeter across. The family
contains three genera: the neotropical Apodanthes with
about five species from Panama throughout South
America to Uruguay and Argentina; the disjunctly distributed Pilostyles with c. nine species in the southern

United States, Mexico, Panama, Venezuela, and Brazil,
one species in Iran and Syria, and three in southwestern
Australia [14]; and the African Berlinianche (a genus
name that has never been validly published) with one or
two species in Angola, southern Congo, Zambia, and
Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Tanzania. Both species of “Berlinianche“ were originally described in Pilostyles, and
seven of the species of Pilostyles and Apodanthes have
been moved between these genera, suggesting that the
generic distinctions are not clear-cut. Apodanthes is
supposed to have deciduous perianth segments, while
Pilostyles has persistent perianth segments. The three
genera also overlap in their host preferences, with Apodanthes parasitizing the Fabaceae Adesmia and the Salicaceae Casearia and Xylosma, and Pilostyles and
Berlinianche parasitizing a range of other Fabaceae
[13,15].
Two molecular-systematic studies have included Apodanthaceae together with representative samples of
other flowering plants [2,16]. Both also included the
parasites’ host species to check for possible horizontal
gene transfer between parasite and host. Nickrent et al.
[16] sequenced the mitochondrial (mt) gene atp1 for
Apodanthes caseariae, Berlinianche aethiopica, and
Pilostyles thurberi, mt matR for A. caseariae and
P. thurberi, and nuclear ribosomal 18S for P. thurberi.
The atp1 gene placed the three genera together, but
showed Pisum (Fabaceae) and Polemonium (Ericales)
embedded among them, albeit without statistical support. The matR gene placed Apodanthes and Pilostyles
together (posterior probability 100) and both as the sister clade to Begonia and Cucurbita (Cucurbitales) with a
posterior probability of 98. The nuclear 18S region,
finally, placed P. thurberi as sister to Gossypium and
Pavonia (Malvales), albeit again without statistical
support.
Barkman et al. [2] included only P. thurberi, but
sequenced three mt genes, atp1, matR, and cox1, for a
data set that covered at least one family from 44 of the
45 orders of angiosperm. A maximum likelihood tree
from the combined data grouped P. thurberi as sister to
Begonia and Echinocystis (the two representatives of the
order Cucurbitales), although with low bootstrap support. The relationship received support from a seemingly uniquely shared 3 bp (one codon) insertion in
the matR genes of P. thurberi, Begonia and Echinocystis.
Both studies [2,16] explained the contradictory placements of Apodanthaceae in the atp1, matR, and 18S
gene trees as resulting from horizontal gene transfer
(HGT). This is a plausible explanation because plant
mitochondrial genes are sometimes exchanged between
species [17-20], and most known cases of HGT come
from parasitic plants, which have permanent tissue contact with their hosts [8,16,21-24]. Even nuclear DNA

Page 2 of 8

can be transferred between parasites and their hosts
[25]. Specifically, Nickrent et al. [16] regarded the matR
and atp1 tree topologies as resulting from HGT. The
only placement accepted as trustworthy was that of
P. thurberi near Malvales in the 18S tree. By contrast,
Barkman et al. [2] suggested that matR was not affected
by HGT, but that atp1 had recently been transferred
from a Fabaceae host species to P. thurberi.
Barkman et al.’s [2] evidence for this interpretation
was twofold. First, analyses of atp1 suggested that four
endoparasite lineages, Cytinus, Mitrastema, Pilostyles,
and Rafflesia, all were closely related to their respective
hosts, which appeared extremely unlikely and suggested
that atp1 might be prone to HGT. Second, when comparing the atp1 sequences of two accessions of P. thurberi, one from Arizona (AZ), one from Texas (TX),
Barkman et al. noted that the sequences differed at
eight sites in the gene’s central region. In contrast, comparisons of atp1 from Pilostyles-AZ to atp1 from its
host revealed identical sequences for 804 bp in the central region, but 15 differences at the 5’ and 3’ ends.
Based on these and other comparisons, Barkman et al.
concluded that Pilostyles-AZ and Pilostyles-TX atp1
represent chimeric xenologs that result from multiple
horizontal gene transfers. Chimeric atp1 genes in Apodanthaceae were also inferred from the transfer of a
79-nt track of chloroplast (cp) DNA to the mitochondria
in Apodanthes caseariae, but not Pilostyles thurberi [26].
The only functional cp sequences so far recovered from
any Apodanthaceae come from the small subunit of the
plastid ribosomal RNA 16S gene [14,27]. These results
on chimeric sequences indicate that atp1 is unsuited
for investigating the phylogenetic relationships of
Apodanthaceae.
Other mitochondrial genes that might be explored for
the purpose of phylogenetically placing the Apodanthaceae are the mt cox1 gene [2] and the nad1 B/C exons,
e.g. [20]. The cox1 gene, however, has an extremely low
substitution rate, limiting its usefulness for large-scale
phylogenetics [28], and the nad1 B/C region is prone to
lateral gene transfer [8,20]. Nevertheless, the present
study also explored these genes for Apodanthaceae
phylogenetics.
The most promising genetic markers, however, clearly
are the nuclear 18S region and the mt matR gene. The
highly conserved 18S gene codes for RNA, a major subunit of the ribosome, and large 18S alignments have
been found to contain sufficient signal to recover many
known angiosperm family relationships [29-31]. Also,
Apodanthaceae 18S trees are required to test the surprising Apodanthaceae/Malvales clade discovered by
Nickrent et al. [16]. The maturase-related (matR) gene
is retained regardless of photosynthetic ability, making it
useful for parasite phylogenetics [2,6,9,16]. Different

Filipowicz and Renner BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:219

from the cox1 intron [28], no case of matR loss has
come to light [32]. MatR sequences are now available
for 700+ flowering plants, and the gene’s phylogenetic
utility in rosids has been shown in a critical study [33].
We therefore generated 18S and matR sequences from
multiple accessions and species of Apodanthaceae from
the United States, Chile, Iran, and Australia. The
sequences were aligned with representatives of all seven
families of Cucurbitales, an order comprising 111 genera
with about 2450 species [34]: Anisophylleaceae (29-40
species in 4 gen.), Begoniaceae (1400 spp. in 2 gen.),
Coriariaceae (15 spp. in 1 genus), Corynocarpaceae
(6 spp. in 1 genus), Cucurbitaceae (950 spp. in c. 100
gen.), Datiscaceae (2 spp. in 1 genus), and Tetramelaceae (2 spp. in 2 gen.). Following Zhu et al. [33], we performed amino acid-level analyses and constructed the
DNA alignment according to the amino acid alignment.
Such codon-based alignments have been shown to result
in better statistical support by reducing misalignment of
non-homologous regions [33,35,36]. As explained above,
we also explored the utility of cox1 and nad1 B/C as
potential markers for placing Apodanthaceae within
angiosperms.

Results
Phylogenetics

Figure 1 shows a maximum likelihood (ML) tree from
the codon alignment of 64 of the 190 matR sequences
analyzed in this study (see Additional File 1 for the full
190-taxon tree and Additional File 2 for a tree from the
amino acid alignment). The included sequences represent 95 families from 39 of the c. 60 orders of flowering
plants, plus 16 accessions from six species of Apodanthaceae from the United States, Chile, and Australia.
The rosid orders Fagales, Rosales, and Cucurbitales are
each recovered as monophyletic (the Fagales and Cucurbitales with 100% bootstrap support, the Rosales with
80% for codon alignment). The inclusion of Apodanthaceae in Cucurbitales has 100% bootstrap support at the
nucleotide level (Figure 1) and 95% on amino acid level
(Additional File 2). Family relationships remain unresolved. Apodanthes is sister to Pilostyles, and accessions
of the West Australian species P. coccoidea and
P. hamiltonii form the sister clade to the North American P. thurberi (represented by four accessions) and the
Chilean P. berteroi. We were unable to amplify the
matR gene from several samples of the Iranian P. haussknechtii, even with four sets of universal primers.
Figure 2 shows an ML tree from the 18S matrix of
197 angiosperm species from 101 families in 16 orders
of rosids, including representatives of all families of
Cucurbitales and four species of Apodanthaceae from
the United States, Iran, Chile, and Australia. Within
Cucurbitales, the Apodanthaceae form the sister clade

Page 3 of 8

to Coriariaceae and Corynocarpaceae, albeit with low
bootstrap support. Within the family, Iranian P. haussknechtii is sister to North American P. thurberi, while
South American P. berteroi is sister to the Australian
P. hamiltonii. The two 18S sequences of P. thurberi
from GenBank [16] fall within Malvales as a sister clade
to Tilia, as found in the original study.
An alignment of 143 cox1 exon sequences (from Cusimano et al. [28]) that included “Berlinianche“ aethiopica
and Pilostyles thurberi sequences from GenBank [2]
placed the latter on an extremely long branch near
Viola, Linum, and Malpighia, albeit without statistical
support (data not shown). A single Apodanthaceae nad1
B/C sequence could not be successfully aligned with the
70-taxon nad1 B/C data set of Won and Renner [20]
nor with newly generated Cucurbitales nad1 B/C
sequences.
Codon substitutions

All Apodanthaceae and Cucurbitales share three unique
codon changes: at positions 256, a C changed to a T,
and at positions 505 and 700, a G to an A (coordinates
from Nicotiana tabacum NC006581). Two of these
changes are non-synonymous, and the change at position 700 also results in changing the polarity of the
encoded amino acid (alanine to threonine). In addition,
there is synonymous and variable substitution at position 532; Apodanthes caseariae and the Australian Apodanthaceae (P. hamiltonii and P. coccoidea) here have a
codon CUG, while the remaining Cucurbitales have
CUC. Both codons encode leucine. American Pilostyles
species at this position have AUG, encoding methionine,
while Fagales, Fabales and Rosales have AUC, coding for
isoleucine. We also found the codon insertion uniquely
shared by Cucurbitales and Apodanthaceae (at position
288, coordinates from Nicotiana tabacum NC006581),
previously reported for P. thurberi, Begonia, and Echinocystis (at position 341, coordinates from Arabidopsis
thaliana NC001284; [2]). Australian Apodanthaceae and
A. caseariae moreover share a 12-nt insertion (corresponding to 4 amino acids) at position 1531.

Discussion
Phylogenetic placement of the Apodanthaceae in the
Cucurbitales

The mitochondrial and nuclear data analyzed here show
that Apodanthaceae belong in the Cucurbitales, an
order here represented by 22 or 29 species in 16 or 22
genera from its seven families (Figures 1 and 2). In both
trees, all sequences of Apodanthaceae form a clade, and
all families of Cucurbitales are recovered as monophyletic. The 18S tree moreover recovers the core cucurbit
clade of Datiscaceae, Begoniaceae, Tetramelaceae, and
Cucurbitaceae, the Corynocarpaceae and Coriariaceae

clade, and the placement of Anisophylleaceae also found
with 12,000 nucleotides of nuclear, plastid and mitochondrial gene sequences [34]. While not resolving
within-Cucurbitales family relationships, matR is sufficiently variable to recover angiosperm ordinal relationships that agree with those found with other kinds of
data [1,37-39]. An example is that Cucurbitales are

sister to Fagales as found by Zhang et al. [34] and
Moore et al. [39].
Nickrent et al. [16] were the first to find a relationship
between Pilostyles and Cucurbitales using matR, but distrusted this grouping (as well as their atp1 tree) because
of possible HGT. Our data reject this explanation
because Apodanthaceae accessions from the different

hosts and continents group together, which is implausible under the assumption of HGT. Another argument
against HGT affecting our data sets is that the nuclear
and mitochondrial trees agree in their placement of
Apodanthaceae. It was only when Barkman et al. [2]
found a codon insertion in the matR gene that was
uniquely shared by Pilostyles, Echinocystis and Begonia
that a possible phylogenetic relationship among these
taxa became a strong hypothesis. The wider taxon sampling used here confirms the presence of a synapomorphic codon insertion in all Cucurbitales (including
Apodanthaceae) at position 288 in Nicotiana tabacum

NC006581. Additionally, we found three other codon
changes shared by Apodanthaceae and Cucurbitales, two
of them non-synonymous. This fits with Zhu et al.’s [33]
finding that the matR non-synonymous substitution rate
is relatively high and close to the gene’s synonymous
substitution rate, indicating relaxed selection.
Morphological traits supporting the Cucurbitales/
Apodanthaceae clade and possible relationships with
Coriariaceae and Corynocarpaceae

The Cucurbitales are a large order (7 families, 111 genera,
2450 species), characterized by ancestrally inferior ovaries

Filipowicz and Renner BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:219
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/219

and parietal placentation [34,40], traits than can now be
interpreted as a morphological synapomorphy with Apodanthaceae, especially since parietal placentation is a rare
feature. Other traits characterizing most Cucurbitales are
unisexual flowers, and a dioecious mating system [34].
Apodanthaceae also have strictly unisexual flowers,
with dioecy very common [14,41]. However, unisexual
flowers and dioecy are strongly overrepresented among
heterotrophic angiosperms [42], cautioning against overconfidence in this trait as evolutionarily conservative.
The 18S tree (Figure 2) shows the Apodanthaceae in a
polytomy with Coriariaceae (a family of one genus and
15 species) and Corynocarpaceae (one genus with 6 species), albeit without statistical support. These families
are sister clades [34] and differ from other Cucurbitales
in having superior ovaries with apical placentation and
mostly bisexual flowers ([34] for a tabulation of Cucurbitales morphological traits). Within Cucurbitales,
they are therefore morphologically distant from
Apodanthaceae.

Conclusions
The fossil record of Cucurbitales goes back to the
Uppermost Paleocene and Lower Eocene London Clay
[34], indicating the deep evolutionary history of the
order. So far, no Cucurbitales are known to be hosts of
Apodanthaceae, and irrespective of the latter’s precise
placement in Cucurbitales, it is clear that Apodanthaceae have been on their own evolutionary trajectory for
a very long time. The family’s presence in both, South
America and Africa, might point to a history going back
to a time when some of the fragments of the super-continent Gondwana were still close to each other. However, analysis of the biogeography of Apodanthaceae will
require inclusion of the two African species, one only
known from the type collection destroyed during World
War II. The genetically and morphologically well-supported inclusion of Apodanthaceae in the Cucurbitales
solves one of the last family-level “problems” in flowering plant phylogenetics [1] and finally allows assessing
which genetic material these holoparasites may have
acquired from host species.
Methods
Taxon sampling

The matR matrix included 190 sequences, representing
95 families from 39 orders of angiosperms; 22 of the
sequences newly generated for this study. The 18S
matrix included 197 sequences representing 101 families
from 16 orders of rosids; four new Apodanthaceae

Page 6 of 8

sequences were generated. For detailed information on
voucher material, host species and GenBank accession
numbers see additional file 3.
Molecular methods

Molecular methods, including DNA extraction, PCR
amplification, and DNA sequencing were performed as
described in Zhang et al. [34]. MatR primers used
where those of Barkman et al. [9], and 18S primers were
those of Nickrent and Starr [43].
Alignments and phylogenetic analyses

We downloaded the matR alignment of Zhu et al. [33]
(TreeBase accession number M3533), extracted 30 core
rosid sequences from it and added 34 sequences relevant to this study, namely all available and new
sequenced representatives of Apodanthaceae, the seven
families of Cucurbitales, five of the eight families of
Fagales, five families of the nine families of Rosales,
and two of the four families of Fabales, including Apodanthaceae host species. DNA sequences were then
translated using the ExPASy Proteomics Server [44]
and aligned at the amino acid level using MAFFT
[45,46]. The corresponding DNA codon alignment
(reverse-translated) was then produced using the
PAL2NAL program [47]. The 64-taxon-matrix created
generated by PAL2NAL did not include ambiguously
aligned sections.
We also produced a 190-taxon matR matrix, which
included additional eudicots, using MAFFT and followed
by minor manual adjustments. Regions of uncertain alignment in the 190-taxon-matrix were excluded prior to analysis (161 nt from the beginning,76 nt from the end and 7
nt fragment at position 814 of original alignment).
The 567-taxon three-gene alignment of Soltis et al.
[30,31] was received from P. Soltis, the matrix then
reduced to the 18S gene (~1800 bp) of the rosids to which
were added the 18S sequences of Cucurbitales from
Zhang et al. [34] and the newly generated Apodanthaceae
sequences. This resulted in 197-taxon 18S matrix.
Phylogenetic analyses for the matR gene were performed at the nucleotide (codon) and the amino acid
level, and for the 18S gene at the nucleotide level,
using ML and full ML bootstrapping (100 replicates),
with the GTR + GAMMA substitution model for the
nucleotide alignment and the JTT model for the AA
alignment, as implemented in RAxML [48]. The matR
64-taxon tree and the 18S 197-taxon tree were rooted
on Nicotiana tabacum, and the matR 190-taxon tree
on Austrobaileyales.
