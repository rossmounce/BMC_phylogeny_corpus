Abstract
Background: The phylogeny of Arthropoda is still a matter of harsh debate among systematists,
and significant disagreement exists between morphological and molecular studies. In particular,
while the taxon joining hexapods and crustaceans (the Pancrustacea) is now widely accepted among
zoologists, the relationships among its basal lineages, and particularly the supposed reciprocal
paraphyly of Crustacea and Hexapoda, continues to represent a challenge. Several genes, as well as
different molecular markers, have been used to tackle this problem in molecular phylogenetic
studies, with the mitochondrial DNA being one of the molecules of choice. In this study, we have
assembled the largest data set available so far for Pancrustacea, consisting of 100 complete (or
almost complete) sequences of mitochondrial genomes. After removal of unalignable sequence
regions and highly rearranged genomes, we used nucleotide and inferred amino acid sequences of
the 13 protein coding genes to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among major lineages of
Pancrustacea. The analysis was performed with Bayesian inference, and for the amino acid
sequences a new, Pancrustacea-specific, matrix of amino acid replacement was developed and used
in this study.
Results: Two largely congruent trees were obtained from the analysis of nucleotide and amino
acid datasets. In particular, the best tree obtained based on the new matrix of amino acid
replacement (MtPan) was preferred over those obtained using previously available matrices (MtArt
and MtRev) because of its higher likelihood score. The most remarkable result is the reciprocal
paraphyly of Hexapoda and Crustacea, with some lineages of crustaceans (namely the Malacostraca,
Cephalocarida and, possibly, the Branchiopoda) being more closely related to the Insecta s.s.
(Ectognatha) than two orders of basal hexapods, Collembola and Diplura. Our results confirm that
the mitochondrial genome, unlike analyses based on morphological data or nuclear genes,
consistently supports the non monophyly of Hexapoda.

Conclusion: The finding of the reciprocal paraphyly of Hexapoda and Crustacea suggests an
evolutionary scenario in which the acquisition of the hexapod condition may have occurred several
times independently in lineages descending from different crustacean-like ancestors, possibly as a
consequence of the process of terrestrialization. If this hypothesis was confirmed, we should
therefore re-think our interpretation of the evolution of the Arthropoda, where terrestrialization
may have led to the acquisition of similar anatomical features by convergence. At the same time,
the disagreement between reconstructions based on morphological, nuclear and mitochondrial
data sets seems to remain, despite the use of larger data sets and more powerful analytical
methods.

Background
With over one million recognized species, which account
for more than 80% of described animal species, Arthropoda (insects, crustaceans and their kin) display an unprecedented richness and extraordinary diversity in terms of
morphology and lifestyle adaptations. Early differentiation of stem lineages, explosive radiations, and abrupt
modifications in developmental patterns have been proposed to be responsible for such a diversity [1,2]. This,
together with the subsequent long anagenetic evolution
along each major lineage, has considerably complicated
our possibility to reconstruct their phylogenetic relationships. Despite the fact that the interpretation of the evolutionary history of arthropod groups have long attracted
the interest of systematists, relationships among and
between major lineages are still fiercely debated.
Important contributions recently revolutionized the current view on the phylogenetic relationships among and
within major lineages of Arthropoda (Chelicerata, Crustacea, Hexapoda and Myriapoda). One of the most contentious issues was the identification of the closest relative to
the Hexapoda, with Myriapoda and Crustacea alternatively emerging as plausible candidates. While the traditional view, mostly based on morphological evidence,
emphasized the affinities between Hexapoda and Myriapoda (= Atelocerata), recent molecular data consistently
indicate crustaceans (or some of their lineages) as the sister group of the hexapods (Pancrustacea, sensu [3], or Tetraconata, sensu [4]) [5-11], with myriapods emerging
earlier from the arthropod tree, or else associated with the
chelicerates (Paradoxopoda, sensu [12], or Myriochelata
sensu [10]). This has fostered a reappraisal of the morphological evidence [13,14], and the "Pancrustacea" hypothesis has gained growing credibility among the
community of arthropod systematists.
Focusing on the relationships inside the Pancrustacea,
recent phylogenetic reconstructions, based on the analysis
of mitochondrial and nuclear genes, have questioned the
mutual monophyly of crustaceans and hexapods [15,16].
These analyses led to a radical rearrangement of major
pancrustacean lineages, with insects frequently emerging

as a nested clade within crustaceans [12,17], and Branchiopoda and Malacostraca as the sister groups to hexapods,
with the exclusion of other crustaceans [16,18]. In addition, the position of some basal groups, generally considered to be the earliest offshoots of hexapod evolution, has
been questioned on the basis of molecular evidence, that
suggests that some crustacean groups might be more
closely related to the crown group of hexapods (Insecta
s.s.) than Collembola and Diplura [19,20].
Hexapoda have been traditionally considered a monophyletic taxon based on the shared organization of body
segments, the presence of six legs, and terrestrialization.
According to mouthpart organization, two groups are generally recognized: the Entognatha (Protura, Collembola
and Diplura) and the Ectognatha (Microcoryphia, Zygentoma and Pterygota) [21,22]. While the monophyly of
Ectognatha (= Insecta sensu stricto, hereafter Insecta) seems
to be reasonably well established, a coherent agreement
for the relative position of Protura, Collembola and
Diplura, and for the monophyly of this latter taxon, is not
yet emerging [23-27]. Morphological or combined analyses [26,28], as well as analyses based on rRNA sequences
[17,29,30], support a sister group relationship between
Protura and Diplura (Nonoculata) with the exclusion of
Collembola. Alternatively, molecular analyses based on
mitochondrial genes consistently recover Collembola,
and possibly Diplura, as emerging very early in the pancrustacean tree, with some crustaceans being more closely
related to the Insecta than are the entognathans
[15,16,19,31,32]. Mitochondrial gene order rearrangements, which proved themselves crucial for high-level
phylogenetics (see [6] for a key example), do not seem to
be informative at this level [20], although they might provide useful information within orders.
The robustness and informativeness of the signal contained in mitochondrial gene sequences for high-level
phylogenetics have been questioned [33-35], despite the
fact that they have been extensively used at virtually all
taxonomic levels [36]. Specific criticism has focused on
three major issues: a) the possibility to correctly model
DNA or protein sequence changes; b) the impact of

genome wide biases on phylogenetic reconstructions; c)
outgroup choice.
While model-based methods of phylogenetic reconstruction for DNA sequences rely on quite sophisticated models of evolution [36], models of protein evolution have
been more difficult to implement. Currently used matrices have been derived from nuclear (JTT [37]; WAG [38]),
or vertebrate mitochondrial datasets (MtMam [39]; MtRev
[40]), and are not therefore of immediate applicability to
invertebrate mitochondrial data sets. This led to a reappraisal of the utility of these matrices [41,42] and the
development of a more specific MtArt matrix based on
arthropod mitochondrial genomes, that clearly outperforms other models across a variety of invertebrate data
sets [41].
Genome-wide biases have been deemed responsible for
some of the inconsistencies observed in mitochondrial
genome trees. These include rate and base composition
inequalities, that can lead to the attraction of long or ATrich branches, and gene translocations on different
strands, that impose a pressure towards the assimilation
of within-strand base composition [43], thus violating
model stationarity. These problems are generally
addressed by excluding the most deviating sequences
from the analysis, rather that attempting to correct for
these violations. Therefore, the attention is shifted to the
possibility of detecting, rather than correcting, these
biases; though not addressing the problem directly, this is
likely the best option available at present.
Finally, the opportunity of using different outgroups, and
the dependency of the reconstruction upon outgroup
choice, has been largely discussed for analyses encompassing all arthropods, whose closest relative is not
known with confidence. On the other hand, in a study
focusing on the pancrustaceans, outgroup choice naturally falls on myriapods and chelicerates.
In this study we analyzed all one-hundred currently available complete mitochondrial genomes from the Pancrustacea, including 5 newly sequenced genomes from the
basal hexapod orders Collembola (4) and Microcoryphia
(1), with the aim of resolving phylogenetic relationships
among the Pancrustacea, and paying special attention to
the position of basal hexapod lineages. Likelihood and
Bayesian methods were used to analyze DNA and amino
acid sequences. A new matrix of protein change was
derived from the dataset itself, and its performance compared with other available matrices.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide data set
In the Bayesian analysis of the nucleotide data set (1st and
2nd codon positions only) stationarity was found to be
reached before 50,000 generations, and therefore 5% of
sampled trees (500) were removed as the burnin of the
analysis. Figure 1 shows the resulting tree, with posterior
probabilities indicated at nodes.

In this tree, Hexapoda and Crustacea appear as mutually
paraphyletic. Among crustaceans, major monophyletic
lineages recovered are Cirripedia, Branchiopoda, Decapoda, Stomatopoda, and Malacostraca (Decapoda + Stomatopoda).
Branchiopoda,
Malacostraca
and
Cephalocarida form a monophyletic clade, that appears as
the sister group of the Insecta. Cirripedia (Maxillopoda)
are the basal lineage of the whole Pancrustacea grouping.
Within the monophyletic Decapoda, supported formal
taxa below the ordinal level are the Brachyura (Callinectes,
Portunus, Pseudocarcinus, Geothelphusa, Eriocheir), the Dendrobranchiata Penaeidae (Marsupenaeus and Penaeus),
and the family Portunidae (Callinectes and Portunus). The
clustering of Macrobrachium with the two Dendrobranchiata makes the Pleocyemata paraphyletic (all Decapoda
included here except for Marsupenaeus and Penaeus).
Within Brachyura, the clustering of Geothelphusa with Eriocheir makes the Heterotremata paraphyletic. Phylogenetic relationships within the Stomatopoda reflect the
accepted taxonomic scheme, with the three Squillidae
(Harpiosquilla, Squilla empusa and S. mantis) clustered
together.
The clustering of Branchiopoda, Malacostraca and Cephalocarida (Thoracopoda sensu [9,44]) with the Insecta, and
with the exception of Collembola and Diplura, makes the
Hexapoda, as traditionally defined, paraphyletic. Collembola are monophyletic, sister-group of the Thoracopoda +
Insecta. Within Collembola, the superfamily Poduromorpha (Podura, Friesea, Gomphiocephalus, Onychiurus, and
Tetrodontophora) and the family Onychiuridae (Onychiurus
and Tetrodontophora) are monophyletic. Entomobryomorpha are paraphyletic with the symphypleonan Sminthurus
nested within. Surprisingly, this analysis fails to recover
the monophyly of Diplura. Japyx solifugus is basal to the
cluster composed by Collembola, Thoracopoda and
Insecta, while Campodea fragilis and C. lubbocki are associated with the remipedian Speleonectes in a basal branching
of the Pancrustacea.
The monophyletic Insecta (apart from the position of
Armillifer, see below) have monophyletic Microcoryphia,
Zygentoma, Pterygota and Dicondylia (Zygentoma +
Pterygota). Within Pterygota, whose basalmost lineage is
the odonatan Orthetrum, the holometabolan orders Diptera, Lepidoptera and Coleoptera are monophyletic, but

Holometabola per se are not. Traditional supraordinal
assemblages, such as orthopteroids (Polyneoptera) and
hemipteroids (Paraneoptera) are not recovered as monophyletic. A basal split distinguishes two major clusters of
Neoptera. The first one is composed by the representatives
of polyneopteran orders, the Plecoptera (Pteronarcys), and
the Diptera. Within Polyneoptera, with the basal Locusta
(Orthoptera), the clade (Blattaria + Mantodea) is sister
group to the assemblage (Grylloblattodea + (Mantophasmatodea + Phasmatodea)). Highly unusual features are
the disjunction of the orthopteran genera Locusta and
Gryllotalpa, and the association of the pentastomid Armillifer with the strepsipteran Xenos, these latter nested within
the clade of hemipteroid species (Heteroptera + Homoptera). This clade is sister to the Coleoptera and both are
joined with the Lepidoptera in the second major clade of
Neoptera.
A new model of amino acid replacement in Pancrustacea:
MtPan
A model describing the evolution in time of the sequences
can be built empirically using properties calculated
through comparisons of observed sequences, or parametrically using chemical and biological properties of DNA
and amino acids. When properties shared by a set of
sequences are too subtle or hidden to be analytically represented (or there are too many degrees of freedom),
amino acid replacement models should be obtained
through an empirical approach. This approach has the
advantage of allowing a small number of degrees of freedom since parameter values are fixed, being estimated
only once and then assumed to be applicable to all datasets. The result is a model computationally easy to use, but
the breadth of the applicability has to be considered carefully because there is little or no way for it to be influenced
by the data analysed.
Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid data set
The amino acid data set (86 taxa, 3006 amino acid aligned
positions) was analyzed with three different matrices of
amino acid replacement using MrBayes. The 10 analyses
run for each matrix were compared in plots where the Log
likelihood of the sampled trees are plotted against generations (Figure 2).

In the analyses with the MtRev matrix, the Log likelihood
values of the final topology of the 10 runs ranged from 206,500 to -205,900, with five independent runs (#1, #2,
#5, #7, #10) converging to a very similar score (around 205,900). In 3 of these 5 runs (#1, #2, #10), stationarity
was reached relatively early (before the 150,000th generation), while runs #2 and #7 suddenly jumped to a better
likelihood score after 500,000 and 750,000 generations,
respectively. In this case, a consensus tree was constructed
pooling together all sampled trees from the five runs, after

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/S2/S8

the removal of burnin as follows: 1,000 trees for run #5
(10%), 1500 trees for runs #1 and #10 (15%), 5,000 trees
for run #2 (50%) and 7,500 trees for run #7 (75%).
In the analyses with the MtArt matrix, the Log likelihood
values of the final topology of the 10 runs ranged from 200,400 to -199,900, and two runs, #3 and #9, converged
to a similar score. Interestingly, these two runs reach stationarity late in the generations, jumping to the higher
score after 550,000 generations (55% of burnin). We
therefore constructed the consensus tree using all trees
sampled in both runs, after removal of the burnin (5,500
trees).
In the 10 runs with the MtPan matrix, the Log likelihood
of the final topology ranged from -200,600 to -199,800,
with one run (#4) converging to a considerably better likelihood score than all other runs. In run #4, stationarity
was reached after about 200,000 generations, so the
burnin removed to build the final consensus tree was
2,000 trees (20%).
The three reconstructions and likelihood plots obtained
using different matrices were compared. The matrix
MtPan apparently outperforms the two other matrices
with this data set, as expected, as it gives higher likelihoods for most runs, and the resulting trees are more
resolved and display higher posterior probabilities at
most nodes. Furthermore, being the matrix MtPan specifically developed based on Pancrustacean sequences, it is
likely to model evolutionary processes with more accuracy in this specific data set than other matrices developed
for different purposes. The following considerations are
based on the run (#4) from matrix MtPan that converges
to the higher likelihood.
The phylogenetic tree obtained (Figure 3) retrieves the following recognized taxa as monophyletic: Collembola,
Diplura, Insecta, Microcoryphia, Zygentoma, Dicondylia,
Pterygota, Diptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Malacostraca, Decapoda, Stomatopoda, Branchiopoda and Cirripedia. Conversely, both Hexapoda and Crustacea are
retrieved as paraphyletic. The Malacostraca + Hutchinsoniella clade is the sister-group of all Insecta, with the exclusion of Diplura and Collembola. Within Insecta, the three
more intensively sampled orders of Holometabola (Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Diptera) are monophyletic, so
are the basal taxa Microcoryphia and Zygentoma, but the
polyneopterans and paraneopterans do not form monophyletic clusters, nor do the Holometabola. The plecopteran Pteronarcys clusters with the Diptera in a basal clade,
and the representatives of the remaining orthopteroid
orders (Periplaneta, Tamolanica, Sclerophasma, Timema,
Grylloblatta, Locusta and Gryllotalpa) do not cluster
together. The two orthopterans (Locusta and Gryllotalpa),

in fact, cluster with a clade joining Coleoptera + Lepidoptera, and a group of hemipteroid species (Triatoma, Pachypsilla, Trialeuroides, Homalodisca and Philaneus), with the
strepsipteran Xenos and the pentastomid Armillifer nested
within. In this group, Triatoma, the only Heteroptera, is
basal to all other homopterans. Within Collembola, the
relationships are the same as those derived form the
nucleotide tree, with the exception of the closer affinity of
Friesea with Gomphiocephalus rather than with Podura.
Among crustaceans, relationships within Malacostraca
(here, Decapoda + Stomatopoda) are the same as those
observed in the nucleotide tree, and largely congruent
with the known phylogeny of the group. The two Cirripedia (Maxillopoda) cluster together, as do the four Branchiopoda. However, Branchiopoda do not cluster with
Malacostraca, as they do in the nucleotide tree, but come
out of a well supported basal tricotomy with Collembola
and (Insecta + (Malacostraca + Hutchinsoniella)).

Discussion
In the analysis of the amino acid data set, the plots of likelihood values versus generations (Figure 2) allow the evaluation of the robustness of the results with respect to
differences among runs and variations of starting points.
In this context, while in the analysis using the MtPan
matrix, one run (#4) selects a clearly better topology than
all other runs, in the analyses using the MtArt and the
MtRev matrices, several runs converge to similar optimal
topologies (2 for MtArt and 5 for MtRev). A detailed scrutiny of the topologies selected with each matrix (not
shown), and the lower resolution of the reconstructions
resulting from the consensus of the trees sampled in each
run, pooled for each matrix, show that topologies with

similar likelihood values may differ considerably. That is
to say that considerably different topologies may have
similar likelihood values. In addition, the differences are
generally concentrated in the deepest nodes, rather than
the most apical ones. This suggests that relationships
among basal lineages of Pancrustacea, based on the
amino acid sequences of mt PCGs, are still quite unstable,
and that the choice of one topology over another may be
dependent on the efficiency of the algorithm to explore
the likelihood space, as well as on the alignment, data and
taxon choice, and the matrix of amino acid replacement.
Nevertheless, the use of a taxon-specific model of evolution (MtPan) may significantly improve the performance
of the analysis, and the tree obtained with the best run
using MtPan is considerably better (harmonic mean of Log likelihood = 199848.98) than all other best trees
obtained with the two other matrices (harmonic mean of
-Log likelihood always >200,000.00). We therefore consider the topology of Figure 3 as our best estimate of the
phylogenetic relationships of the Pancrustacea using
mitochondrial PCGs, and focus the following discussion
on this topology.
The trees obtained based on the nucleotide dataset (complete and with 3rd codon positions excluded) are largely
congruent among them and with the aforementioned
MtPan tree #4. Comparing the two nucleotide trees, the
one obtained based on the complete dataset displays generally lower posterior probabilities, especially at the
deeper nodes, than the one obtained based on 1st and 2nd
codon positions only. This is likely due to the fact that 3rd
codon positions, in comparisons among more distant
sequences, are highly saturated, and therefore tend to blur

the phylogenetic signal at deeper nodes, hence the
decrease in posterior probabilities. We regard the analysis
on 1st and 2nd codon positions as our best estimate for the
nucleotide dataset, and refer to this in all subsequent reasoning.
The most remarkable outcome of the analyses presented
here is the supposed reciprocal paraphyly of Crustacea
and Hexapoda, already suggested in previous studies
[15,16,32], and here confirmed on the basis of the largest
data set available so far for mitochondrial genomes of
Pancrustacea.
In both trees the Cirripedia (Maxillopoda) occupy a basal
position, and in the analysis with the amino acid
sequences they are clustered with the remipedian Speleonectes. Remipedians are a recently discovered arthropod
taxon, whose phylogenetic position is still debated
[31,45-47]. They have been considered the most basal
group of crustaceans [48], but according to their complex
brain architecture, they are somehow associated with
Malacostraca and Insecta [49]. Other genes also suggest a
closer affinity of Remipedia with Cephalocarida (Hutchinsoniella) and the Insecta [7,18,46]. The placement of
Remipedia and Maxillopoda at the base of the pancrustacean tree conflicts with gene order data that include
Cephalocarida, Maxillopoda and Pentastomida in a more
derived position [16,31]. Other phylogenetic studies
based on nuclear genes, or on a combined analysis of
molecular and morphological data, support a closer relationship between Maxillopoda + Malacostraca [18,50].
In the analysis of the nucleotide data set, Speleonectes is
clustered with the two species of the dipluran genus Campodea. Although Diplura have been previously suggested
as being paraphyletic [27], this was based on the comparison of the structure of the ovary with respect to other
entognathan hexapods. In this context, the unusual association of Campodea and Speleonectes is most likely due to
anomalies in the evolution of the molecules, such as uneven rates of substitution and/or attraction of long
branches. Diplurans have already been found to display
accelerated rates of evolution leading to long branches
that may uncoventionally attract unrelated taxa
[30,47,50,51]. Remarkably, Diplura form a well supported monophyletic clade based on the analysis of the
amino acid data set.
Regardless of the mono/paraphyly of Diplura, their position, as well as the position of Collembola, in both trees,
strongly suggests non-monophyly of Hexapoda, as commonly defined. Although traditionally included in the
Entognatha [21], recent studies and the re-interpretation
of morphological characters have challenged the common
origin of entognathy observed in living Collembola, Pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/S2/S8

tura and Diplura [22,24,25,52,53]. Moreover, molecular
phylogenetic studies have provided alternative views of
internal relationships of Entognatha. Nuclear genes
(mostly rDNA genes) usually join Diplura and Protura in
the Nonoculata, and place Collembola as the basal taxon
of Entognatha [17,26,29,30,50], although always in the
context of monophyletic Hexapoda. On the other hand,
previous studies based on the mitochondrial genome consistently place Collembola outside the clade joining the
Insecta with some crustacean lineages (Malacostraca and,
sometimes, also the Branchiopoda) [15,16,19,32]. Our
study confirms this view, and the addition of Diplura reinforces the idea of a paraphyletic Hexapoda. Non-monophyly of Hexapoda is indeed difficult to accept from a
morphological perspective [28], and the robustness of the
reconstructions based on mitochondrial data sets available so far has been challenged as a potential artifact of the
analysis: insufficient sampling density, gene selection,
outgroup choice, alignment, type of data, analytical methods, and peculiarities of the structural evolution of the
mitochondrial genome [33-35]. In addition, most molecular data sets based on nuclear genes also support hexapod monophyly [17,23,29], but not all of them, especially
when mitochondrial and nuclear genes are combined
[26]. In our study, we have tried to tackle some of the
most common criticism by extending our data set to all
mitochondrial protein coding genes, and adding more
dipluran and collembolan sequences, as well as exploiting
the higher number of pancrustacean sequences now available. To improve the phylogenetic analysis we also used
two new matrices of amino acid replacement [21], including one specifically designed for Pancrustacea (MtPan).
There is a growing body of evidence that phylogenetic
inferences are more reliable the more accurate the model
of sequence evolution are and that maximum likelihood
or posterior probability represent a robust criterion for the
choice of the best models. MtArt and MtPan models are
both derived from the analysis of inferred substitutions in
reference sequences, therefore they have fixed and equal
number of parameters. Advantages of this approach can
be the better description of the evolution of the sequences
under study, if a suitable reference set is used, particularly
if this reference set is large. Disadvantages can be inaccuracy owing to an inappropriate reference set and a lack of
a broader biological interpretability of purely empirical
findings. Here we use the sequence data set under study to
derive a model to best to accomodate the trade-off
between incorporating into models enough biological
reality to capture evolutionary information accurately and
avoid overparameterization that can lead to a loss of discriminatory power. The differences between MtPan and
MtArt, although small, are subtly widespread in all 20 ×
20 amino acid exchange rates and frequencies and the
Mantel test, which computes a correlation between two n

× n distance or similarity matrices, shows that the two
matrices are significantly different.
The consistent finding of non-monophyletic Hexapoda
requires some considerations. The most evident outcome
of this result is that the character "hexapody", traditionally invoked as the most important synapomorphy of
Hexapoda, may have arisen at least twice during arthropod evolution. This may even have happened in marine
environments [54], rather than as an adaptation to terrestrialization. This implies that Collembola, Diplura and
Insecta could be better regarded as independent lineages
evolved from different crustacean ancestors after terrestrialization [18].
While Collembola and Diplura appear to stem out the
pancrustacean clade very early, and no clear relationship
has yet been established with any crustacean lineage, our
mitochondrial data set suggests that the Insecta could be
more closely related, among the Crustacea, with the Malacostraca and, possibly, the Branchiopoda. In this context,
our analyses of the nucleotide and amino acid data sets
differ. In the nucleotide data set, the Branchiopoda are
part of a well supported unresolved trichotomy with
Malacostraca and the cephalocaridan Hutchinsoniella. This
clade is the sister taxon of the Insecta, and corresponds to
the Thoracopoda. Relationships within Thoracopoda
remain debated and focus on the homologous patterns of
the limb structure (hence the name thoracopods =
appendages of the thorax). In this respect, the presence of
a single epipod per thoracopod have been proposed as a
potential synapomorphy shared by Malacostraca and
Branchiopoda (and possibly Cephalocarida) [9],
although alternative structures and functions of epipods,
found in different crustacean groups, may have led to
erroneous identification of homologous patterns. In the
amino acid data set, the sister taxon of the Insecta is limited to Malacostraca + Cephalocarida, with the Branchipoda emerging earlier in the tree. Regardless of their closest
crustacean relative(s), all analyses here performed support
the monophyly of the Insecta s.s. (Ectognatha), although
relationships among their internal lineages deserve a careful scrutiny.
Reflecting the most widely accepted interpretation, based
on morphological and molecular data [17,22,29,55], the
basal splitting of the Insecta separates the Microcoryphia
(bristletails) from the Dicondylia (Zygentoma + Pterygota), although some recent analyses of other nuclear
markers [18] would suggest resurrecting the long-abandoned Thysanura s.l. (Microcoryphia + Zygentoma).
Within Microcoryphia and Zygentoma (silverfish), relationships are stable across different analyses, and congruent with the accepted taxonomy. The odonatan Orthetrum
is the basal lineage of the Pterygota (or Metapterygota

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/S2/S8

sensu [56]). The clustering Odonata + Neoptera is also
supported by several morphological features [55,57], and,
in particular, by the complete fixation of the anterior articulation of mandibles [58], but the absence of the
Ephemeroptera from our analysis prevents from drawing
conclusions.
This mitochondrial data set dramatically differs from
most widely accepted reconstructions when looking at the
phylogeny of Neoptera. On one hand, the two analyses
provide strikingly different results. On the other hand, no
major traditional lineage, except for the monophyly of
Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Diptera, seems to be recovered. The most evident anomaly is the placement of the
pentastomid Armillifer, a putative crustacean potentially
associated with Maxillopoda and Cephalocarida [31],
which is joined with the strepsipteran Xenos in a derived
position among Pterygota. This quite evident artifact of
the analysis may be due to exceptionally high rates of evolution shared by these two sequences, a phenomenon
possibly affecting also the clustering of Xenos and Armillifer with the five hemipteran sequences. The representatives of 7 polyneopteran orders are included in our
analysis. However, the plecopteran Pteronarcys always
clusters with the Diptera, somehow confirming an earlier
claim by Hennig [21] that no conclusive evidence is available of the inclusion of Plecoptera in the Polyneoptera
(Paurometabola sensu [59] plus Plecoptera). Another relevant case is that of Orthoptera, here represented by Locusta
and Gryllotalpa, which either do not cluster together (Figure 1), or do not cluster with the remaining polyneopterans (Figure 3). The internal relationships among these
latter orders (Blattodea, Mantodea, Mantophasmatodea,
Phasmatodea and Grylloblattodea) match the results
obtained using a similar data set [60], with a monophyletic Dictyoptera (Blattaria + Mantodea), and a relationship between Mantophasmatodea and Phasmatodea,
with the Grylloblattodea as their sister group, therefore
rejecting the Xenomomia [61]. The taxonomic status and
phylogenetic position of the recently discovered order
Mantophasmatodea in the context of the polyneopteran
assemblage has been thoroughly discussed on morphological and molecular grounds [60-63], and is beyond the
scope of our present analysis. The relationships of polyneopteran insects remains unsolved and may have been
obscured by severe extinction events [64] or by the lack of
good synapomorphic characters.
Surprisingly, the Holometabola do not form a monophyletic clade, in open disagreement with most morphological [21,65] and molecular [66] analyses. The failure of
this data set to support the Holometabola may be due to
the biased sampling of this taxon, with many major lineages (orders) still missing from the analysis (i.e.: Mecoptera, Siphonaptera, Trichoptera, Neuroptera, as well as the

Hymenoptera, not included in the analysis due to their
extreme nucleotide compositional bias), while some (i.e.:
Diptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera) being represented by
many species. Within the monophyletic Coleoptera, phylogenetic relationships are congruent with the traditional
taxonomy: the two Chrysomeloidea (Crioceris and Anoplophora) cluster together, and, with the Tenebrioidea (Tribolium), representing the Cucujiformia, to the exclusion of
the Elateroidea Pyrocoelia. Also within Lepidoptera, relationships reflect the accepted taxonomy, with the basal
Tortricoidea (Adoxophyes), and the clade of Obtectomera
clustering Bombycoidea (Bombyx plus Antherea) and
Pyraloidea (Ostrinia). Finally, both trees support the basal
dipteran split between the nematocerans Culicidae (Aedes
and Anopheles), and the brachycerans. Within Brachycera,
our analysis fails to recover the taxon Acalyptrate (which
should include, here, Drosophilidae and Tephritidae) by
joining the Drosophilidae with the remaining Calyptrate.
One interesting feature of our study is the inclusion in the
analysis of 8 species from 7 different families of Collembola, allowing a preliminary phylogenetic reconstruction
of inter-familiar relationships. In both our trees, the Collembola are monophyletic, and they differ only for the relative position of the three poduromorph species Friesea,
Gomphiocephalus and Podura. Traditional recognized
groupings of Collembola are Neelipleona, Symphypleona
and Arthropleona, the latter furtherly divided into Entomobryomorpha and Poduromorpha [67-69]. One
remarkable outcome of our analysis, is the nesting of the
Symphypleona within the Entomobryomorpha, making
the Arthropleona paraphyletic, and confirming the conclusions of D'Haese [69]. Our analysis also supports the
monophyly of the Poduromorpha (Poduridae, Hypogastruridae, Neanuridae, Onychiuridae, only to mention the
families represented in our data set), defined by the presence of a well developed protergite, with the critical genus
Podura being part of this taxon. This contrasts with the
interpretation that the hypognathous position of the head
is the synapomorphy uniting Poduridae (+ Actaletidae)
with the Symphypleona [70]. Although rejected on the
basis of heart morphology [71], the association between
Poduridae and Symphypleona (+ Neelipleona) was resurrected by Moen and Ellis [68]. Finally, the nesting of
Podura within the monophyletic Poduromorpha was
strongly supported also by the most recent morphological
and molecular (with nuclear genes) analyses [69,72]. As
expected, the two onychiurids, Onychiurus and Tetrodontophora, cluster together. Their strict relationship is supported also by gene order data, given that both species
share the unique mitochondrial translocation of the trnSuga from the original position between cob and nad1 to a
new location between trnI and trnM [16,73].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/S2/S8

Concerning shallow relationships in crustacean clades,
the two trees are perfectly congruent regarding the phylogeny within Stomatopoda and Decapoda, but not within
Branchiopoda. However, the relationships among Stomatopoda significantly differ from those proposed on
morphological grounds [74], which group the Lysiosquillidae (here represented by Lysiosquilla) with the Squillidae
(here: Squilla and Harpiosquilla), and the Gonodactylidae
(here: Gonodactylus) with the Pseudosquillidae (here:
Pseudosquilla). Nevertheless, the biodiversity of Stomatopoda is so underrepresented in our study that molecular
phylogenetic relationships might still be unstable. Within
the Decapoda, with 10 species from 8 different families
sampled, the basal Dendrobranchiata (Marsupenaeus and
Penaeus) cluster with Macrobrachium, traditionally considered a basal lineage of the Pleocyemata [75]. In the
remaining Pleocyemata, the clustering of Palinura (Panulirus) with Astacidea is in agreement with morphological
data [75], but Pagurus (Anomura) is clustered with the
monophyletic Brachyura (Callinectes, Portunus, Pseudocarcinus, Geothelphusa, Eriocheir) instead of the clade Palinura + Astacidea. Within Brachyura, a partial conflict
exists between molecular data among the Heterotremata:
in fact, Callinectes, Portunus, Pseudocarcinus and Geothelphusa share the translocation of the trnH in a new position
between trnE and trnF, but the reconstruction of the phylogenetic relationships based on sequence analysis places
Geothelphusa with Eriocheir, which does not share the
translocation of trnH in the same position. Finally, within
Branchiopoda, the basal position of the anostracan
Artemia, expected on morphological grounds [76], is
retrieved only in the amino acid tree.

Conclusion
Using the largest available mitochondrial DNA data set
for Pancrustacea, our present study confirms that phylogenetic analyses based on the sequence of the mitochondrial
protein coding genes consistently support the reciprocal
paraphyly of Hexapoda and Crustacea. While the Insecta
s.s. are shown as a robust monophyletic clade, Collembola and Diplura fail to be clustered with the remaining
Hexapoda. On the other hand, some lineages of crustaceans, namely Malacostraca, Cephalocarida and, possibly,
Branchiopoda are the sister taxon of the Insecta. This
reconstruction supports an evolutionary scenario in
which hexapody may be considered as the results of independent events of terrestrialization occurred in different
lineages of crustacean-like ancestors. If this hypothesis
was true, then finding the closest crustacean relative to
each hexapod lineage becomes the next major challenge,
which implies sampling the diversity of crustaceans in a
much more massive way. It also implies that the third lineage of entognathan hexapods, the Protura, needs to be
included in future analyses, in order to represent also the
complete diversity of basal hexapods. In addition, we

show that the use of a taxon-specific matrix of amino acid
replacement helps improving the performance of the phylogenetic reconstruction using amino acid sequences of
mitochondrial PCGs.

Methods
Data set and alignment
All available complete mitochondrial genomes from Pancrustacea were used in this study. The monophyly of Pancrustacea was taken as granted, being this taxon
consistently supported in a variety of molecular studies
based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA [6,10,18].

The AMIGA database [77] was used to assemble the initial
dataset. All complete mitochondrial genomes of pancrustacean species available in GenBank in July 2006 (RefSeq
only) were retrieved, totalling 95 sequences. In addition,
five sequences from Myriapoda and Chelicerata were
added as outgroups. The nucleotide sequences of individual protein coding genes (PCGs) were downloaded and
clustered in 13 separate files. Five new undescribed complete mitochondrial genomes determined in our laboratory (4 Collembola and 1 Microcoryphia) were also
added. This generated a complete data set of 105
sequences (100 Pancrustacea and 5 outgroups, listed in
Additional File 1).
The nucleotide sequences of each PCG were retro-aligned
using the RevTrans 1.4 server available through the DTUCBS website [78]. Both the amino acid and the corresponding nucleotide alignments were retained. Finally the
13 data set were concatenated, species-by-species, to produce a final alignment of 105 sequences, 12552 nucleotide and 4184 amino acid positions (alignments available
upon request).
The amino acid data set was manually inspected to isolate
areas of unreliable alignment. These, and the corresponding positions in the nucleotide dataset, were flagged and
excluded from the analysis. A total of 28% of aligned positions were removed, with some genes more affected by the
elimination (atp8 and nad6, over 60%), and others less
affected (cox1, cox3, atp6 and cytb, less than 10%).
Each sequence was subsequently examined in order to
identify those characteristics that have been reported to
introduce errors in the phylogenetic reconstruction. These
include extreme compositional bias [34,35], inversion or
translocation of genes on opposite strand [35], inversion
of control region [43], lack of atp8. This procedure led to
the exclusion of 19 sequences (17 hexapods and 2 crustaceans), reducing the data set to 86 taxa. All following analyses were performed on this final data set, consisting of 86
taxa, 9018 nucleotide and 3006 amino acid aligned positions.

Matrix of amino acid replacement
Here we have followed an approach proposed by David
Jones, Willie Taylor and Janet Thornton [37]. Our model
is a Markov process model, defined by a 20 × 20 matrix
containing the relative rates (i.e. the relative numbers, on
average and per unit time) of occurrence of all possible
replacements derived simply by counting observed amino
acid replacements in the pancrustacean sequence databases. Only very closely related sequences (85%) were
considered, to reduce the frequency with which observed
replacements (e.g. A⇒S), were in fact the result of a set of
successive unobserved replacements (e.g. A⇒R⇒S). From
this matrix are calculated the probabilities of change from
any nucleotide to any other nucleotide (or any amino acid
to any other amino acid), including the probability of
remaining the same, over any period of evolutionary time
(e.g. from one end of a branch to the other) at any site.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis was performed on both nucleotide
and amino acid sequences using a bayesian approach as
implemented in MrBayes, ver. 3.1 [79,80]. For nucleotide
sequences, the GTR+I+G model of sequence evolution
was used. One million generations were run, with four
MC chains, and trees were sampled every 100 generations.
Two independent analyses were run for the complete data
set (9018 nucleotides) and on 1st and 2nd codon positions
only (6012 nucleotide positions). The Log likelihood
scores of each sampled tree were plotted against generations in order to assess the number of generations needed
to reach stationarity and to evaluate the appropriate
burnin (50,000 generations; see Results). A consensus
topology of all trees, after the removal of burnin, was constructed using PAUP* ver. 4.0b10 [81], with the percentage of trees where each node was found expressed on the
tree as posterior probabilities.

For amino acid sequences, three different matrices of
amino acid replacement were used, and the results compared: 1) the general matrix available for mitochondrial
genomes, but based on vertebrate taxa, MtRev [40], MtArt
[41], and our specifically developed matrix, MtPan. Ten
independent runs, of one million generations, two MC
chains, with different random starting points were performed for each matrix. Trees were sampled every 100
generations. Log likelihood scores of the trees in all runs
for each matrix were plotted against generations. Three
plots, one for each matrix, were thus obtained, allowing to
assess the rate of variability of the different runs for each
matrix and the appropriate burnin. Final topologies for
each matrix were obtained from the best run (the one converging to the best likelihood score), or from a group of
runs, if more than one run were found to converge to
nearly identical likelihood scores.
