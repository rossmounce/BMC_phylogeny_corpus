Abstract
An outbreak of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) occurred in Yunnan Province, China between August and
September in 2007. A total of 3,597 cases were officially reported and the incidence rate reached 1390.94/100,000.
Descriptive epidemiological analysis of the outbreak was conducted using the data from National Disease Supervision
Information Management System (NDSIMS). To determine the causative agent for this outbreak and to analyze their
genetic features, 30 conjunctival swabs and 19 paired serum specimens of acute and convalescent phase were
collected from 30 patients with AHC, and viral isolation, molecular typing, antibody assay and phylogenetic analysis
were performed.
11 virus strains were isolated from 30 conjunctival swabs. Amplification and sequencing of the VP4 region of these
strains identified that coxsackievirus A24 variant (CA24v) could be the causative agent of the AHC outbreak and this
was further confirmed by subsequent virus neutralizing antibody test on 19 paired serum specimens. Phylogenetic
analysis based on the 3C regions showed that the Yunnan CA24v strains belonged to Group 3 and clustered with the
strains isolated from worldwide AHC outbreaks after 2002. Phylogenetic analysis based on the partial VP1 revealed that
the Yunnan strains differed from the strains isolated from AHC outbreak in Guangdong of China in 2007 with 2.8 - 3.0%
nucleotide divergence, suggesting that two different lineages of CA24v caused the independent AHC outbreaks in
Yunnan and Guangdong, respectively.
Findings
Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) is a highly contagious epidemic disease, commonly caused by Enterovirus 70 and Coxsackievirus A24 variant (CA24v). CA24v is
an antigenic variant of the CA24 strain and was first isolated from an outbreak of AHC in Singapore in 1970 [1].
The AHC outbreaks caused by CA24v were restricted to
Southeast Asia and India until 1985, and then spread rapidly to other regions of the world [2-4].
In China, the first outbreak of AHC was reported in
1971 [5]. Since then, outbreaks of AHC have been regularly reported [6,7]. Notifiable infectious diseases in
China are classified into Class A, B, and C according to
the degree of risk from the highest to the lowest. AHC
belongs to Class C notifiable infectious disease. When a
case is diagnosed as AHC, physicians are required to reg* Correspondence: wenbo_xu1@yahoo.com.cn

ister the case of AHC to the National Disease Supervision
Information Management System (NDSIMS), which is a
direct reporting network system for notifiable infectious
diseases in China. According to NDSIMS, a total of
74,263 AHC cases were reported in China in 2007, representing an increase of 540.58% compared with 11,593
cases in 2006. There were 134 reported outbreaks,
spreading to 14 provinces and affecting 10,165 people.
Other 64098 are sporadic cases. These data showed that a
nationwide AHC epidemic occurred in China in 2007.
An outbreak of AHC occurred in Suijiang and its neighboring Shuifu Counties, Yunnan Province between
August and September in 2007. In this study, descriptive
epidemiological analysis was conducted using the data
from NDSIMS and the causative agent was determined.
30 conjunctival swabs and 19 paired of acute and convalescent serum specimens were collected from 30 patients
with AHC in Suijiang and Shuifu in September,
2007(Table 1). Two hundred microliter of the swab specimen was inoculated onto RD (rhabdomyosarcoma) and
HEp-2 cells (human epidermoid carcinoma of the larynx).
The cells were observed for 7 days for cytopathic effect

(CPE). Two blind passages were performed when no CPE
was observed.
Viral RNA was extracted from virus culture supernatant with a QIAamp Mini Viral RNA Extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). RT-PCR was performed using
the primers OL68-1 and MD91 targeted for the VP4
region of the human enterovirus as described previously
[8]. The obtained PCR products were purified with a
QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, kk, Japan). The
nucleotide sequence was determined by ABI PRISM 3100
Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Hitachi, Japan)
using BigDye Terminator Version 3.0 (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). The serotype was determined by comparing the VP4 nucleotide sequence with those available
at GenBank database using the BLAST program http://
blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi from NCBI according to
the criteria for molecular typing proposed previously [8].
The neutralizing antibody titers of the 19 paired serum
specimens were determined by a virus neutralization
assay. In brief, serial dilutions of the sera were mixed with
100 50% cell culture infective doses (CCID50) per 50 ul of
the CA24v virus [Strain SF3, isolated from this outbreak,
Genbank number EU596581 (VP1 region) and
GQ229400(3C region)], incubated at 36Â°C for 2 hours and
inoculated onto HEp-2 cells. A 4-fold or greater rise of
CA24v neutralizing antibodies titre between acute and
convalescent serum indicated an acute infection of
CA24v.

For the molecular epidemiologic study, the partial VP1
and 3C region of Yunnan strains were amplified and
sequenced with primers that flanked the VP1 region (forward, CVA24v-2407S: 5'-GTGAGTGCTTGCCCAGATTT-3';
reverse,
CVA24v-3438A:
5'ATACACCGCCATGTTCTGGT-3') designed in this
study and primers 3C1/3C2 that flanked the entire 3C
region [9]. The sequences of partial VP1 and 3C regions
of the Yunnan isolates were aligned with those of the corresponding region of the different geographic and temporal CA24v strains using the CLUSTAL W method [10] in
MEGA 4.0 [11]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed
using the neighbor-joining method in MEGA 4.0 with
bootstrap analysis performed on 1000 replicates. All
sequences reported in this study were deposited into
GenBank under accession number EU596577 to
EU596589 and GQ229391 to GQ229410.
Shuifu and Suijiang Counties are adjacent counties
located in the northeast of Yunnan Province and consist
of 8 townships with a total population of 258,602 people.
This AHC epidemic affected all 8 townships. By September 30, 2007, a total of 3,597 cases were officially reported
by NDSIMS. The incidence rate reached 1390.94/
100,000, no death and severe case occurred. Daily distribution of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis cases between
August and September was shown in Figure 1.The first
clinical diagnosed patient of the outbreak was identified
on August 8, 2007 in Suijiang. Subsequently, the number

of cases increased, reached a peak in the beginning of
September and returned to baseline in late September
(Figure 1). The age of the patients ranged from 3months
to 84 years. The ratio between male and female was
1.71:1. Among all the patients, 46.4% were farmers, followed by students (31.9%) and the mean age was 37.7
years for farmers and 15.2 for students. The most common symptoms were conjunctival congestion (100%), followed by ocular stabbing pain (73.2%) and photophobia
(64.6%). Some patients also appeared systemic symptoms
such as fever (2.5%), fatigue (2.7%) and limbs pain (1.7%).
91.3% of all patients had a clear history of contact with
people with similar symptoms.
As shown in table 1, HEp-2 cell was the only cell line
capable of CA24v isolation in this study. Virus were isolated from 11(37%) of 30 swabs and VP4 regions were
successfully amplified and sequenced for all 11 isolates
(Table 1). All the sequences obtained have the highest
identity (99.0-100.0%) with the CA24v strains (GenBank
No. EU221286 to EU221294) isolated between July and
October, 2007 in Guangdong Province of China [12], suggesting that CA24v could be the causative agent of the
AHC outbreak. The virus neutralizing antibody analysis
for 17 of 19 paired serum specimens showed a 4 fold or
greater rise in neutralizing antibodies titer which provided further evidence that CA24v was the causative
agent of the AHC outbreak in Yunnan (Table 1).
Similar to the previous studies [12,13], the phylogenetic
analysis based on the 3C region revealed that all the
CA24v strains were divided into three major groups.

Page 6 of 7

They are Group1 containing CA24v isolated from 1970 to
1971; Group 2, from 1975; Group 3, from 1985 to 2007.
The Yunnan strains belonged to Group 3 and clustered
with the strains isolated from worldwide AHC outbreaks
after 2002 (Figure 2). The Yunnan strains were most
closely related to those isolated in 2007 in Guangdong
Province of China [12] with high nucleotide identities of
99.1 - 99.3% in 3C (Figure 2). In contrast to 3C region, the
phylogenetic tree based on the partial VP1 region of
CA24v strains showed more divergence between Yunnan
and Guangdong strains, which clearly belonged to two
different lineages (Lineage 1 and Lineage 2), respectively
(Figure 3). The nucleotide identities within Lineages 1
and Lineages 2 were 99.7-100% and 98.6-99.2% respectively and A 2.8 -3.0% nucleotide divergence was found
between these two lineages.
The outbreak of AHC described in this study occurred
between August and September in Yunnan Province. The
climate of this period in Yunnan is characterized by high
temperatures and frequent rainfall, which may be two climatic factors involved in the rapid spread of CA24v
strains. In this outbreak, the most patients were farmers
(46.4%), while workers (37.56%) were the most predominant patient in the contemporaneous AHC outbreak in
Guangdong [12]. That may be because farmers are the
main population (accounting for 78% of the total number) in Shuifu and Shuijiang Counties of Yunnan. Moreover, August and September are in the rice harvest season
and local farmers have the habit of laboring together,
resulting in exposure time and frequency increased significantly. In addition, in rural areas such as these two
counties, the phenomenon of sharing the basins and towels was very common which played an important pole in
causing the outbreak.
Our study demonstrated that CA24v was the causative
agent of this AHC outbreak in Yunnan, southern China.
Moreover, AHC outbreaks reported in Guangdong
(southern China) [12] and Beijing (northern China) [14]
in 2007, were also caused by CA24v. Although the information on the causative agent of AHC outbreaks in other
provinces was not obtained, it is possible that CA24v was
major causative agent during the national AHC outbreak
considering the close temporal and geographical relation.
Although 3C region was commonly used for molecular
epidemiological analysis of CVA24v strains, recent studies have demonstrated that capsid encoding region may
be more informative than the 3C region because of the
high recombination rate in nonstructural region between
enteroviruses and serological pressure on the capsid
encoding region which therefore may evolve faster than
the region encoding for the nonstructural proteins. In
this study, compared with 3C region, phylogenetic tree
based on the partial VP1 region of CA24v strains showed
more divergence between Yunnan and Guangdong

strains and clearly differentiated Yunnan lineage and
Guangdong linage, indicating that two independent outbreaks occurred in Yuannan and Guangdong although
the AHC outbreaks in these two provinces was temporally and geographically related.
