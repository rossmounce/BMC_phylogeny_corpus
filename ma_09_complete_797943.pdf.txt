Abstract
Background: The two closely related species of band-winged grasshoppers, Gastrimargus
marmoratus and Oedaleus asiaticus, display significant differences in distribution, biological
characteristics and habitat preferences. They are so similar to their respective congeneric species
that it is difficult to differentiate them from other species within each genus. Hoppers of the two
species have quite similar morphologies to that of Locusta migratoria, hence causing confusion in
species identification. Thus we determined and compared the mitochondrial genomes of G.
marmoratus and O. asiaticus to address these questions.
Results: The complete mitochondrial genomes of G. marmoratus and O. asiaticus are 15,924 bp and
16,259 bp in size, respectively, with O. asiaticus being the largest among all known mitochondrial
genomes in Orthoptera. Both mitochondrial genomes contain a standard set of 13 protein-coding
genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes and an A+T-rich region in the same order
as those of the other analysed caeliferan species, but different from those of the ensiferan species
by the rearrangement of trnD and trnK. The putative initiation codon for the cox1 gene in the two
species is ATC. The presence of different sized tandem repeats in the A+T-rich region leads to size
variation between their mitochondrial genomes. Except for nad2, nad4L, and nad6, most of the
caeliferan mtDNA genes exhibit low levels of divergence. In phylogenetic analyses, the species from
the suborder Caelifera form a monophyletic group, as is the case for the Ensifera. Furthermore,
the two suborders cluster as sister groups, supporting the monophyly of Orthoptera.
Conclusion: The mitochondrial genomes of both G. marmoratus and O. asiaticus harbor the typical
37 genes and an A+T-rich region, exhibiting similar characters to those of other grasshopper
species. Characterization of the two mitochondrial genomes has enriched our knowledge on
mitochondrial genomes of Orthoptera.

Background
The band-winged grasshoppers, species of the subfamily
Oedipodinae in Acridiidae, encompass over 900
described species. Indeed, the band-winged grasshoppers
include some of the best known and most notorious pests

in the world. Two species of band-winged grasshoppers,
Gastrimargus marmoratus (Thunberg) and Oedaleus asiaticus Bei-Bienko, are listed as major pest Orthoptera species
due to their damage to agriculture [1,2]. G. marmoratus is
mainly distributed in the tropical and warm grassland

ecosystems in South East Asia, as well as southern and east
coastal China. In such areas G. marmoratus is able to move
from the wild vegetation to farmlands with rice, maize,
sugarcane, or other crops [3]. O. asiaticus is only distributed in the Mongolian Plateau and the Transbaikal region
of the southern Russia [4]. It often reaches high population density in overgrazed steppes and xerophytous habitats [5]. O. asiaticus can form swarm bands and exhibit
gregarious-like behaviors. In the steppe region of Inner
Mongolia, it feeds mainly on grasses, such as Leymus chinensis, Stipa spp. and Cleistogenes squarrosa [6]. Although
some biological and ecological research has been done on
the two grasshopper species, studies concerning their
nucleic and mitochondrial DNA sequences still remain
scarce.
There are 23 species in Gastrimargus and 27 in Oedaleus in
the world. Many of these are highly localized; however, G.
marmoratus and O. asiaticus are widespread and abundant.
The morphology of congeneric species in the two genera
is so similar that it is difficult to differentiate one from
another. Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that
the three genera Gastrimargus, Oedaleus, and Locusta are
closely related [7]. The migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, a noxious pest insect in the world, is often found in
sympatry with G. marmoratus or O. asiaticus, although the
geographical ranges of the two latter species don't overlap.
The morphological similarity among hoppers of the three
species has sometimes caused confusion in the field.
Recent concerns about species confusion raised during
estimations of hopper density and dispersal for management practices emphasize the need for accurate nymphal
identification. Therefore, the identification of highly polymorphic genetic markers such as mitochondrial
sequences or nucleic microsatellites has been eagerly
sought.
Mitochondrial genome sequences have been extensively
used for inferring phylogenetic relationships. An accumulating body of evidence reveals that analyses based on
whole mitochondrial sequence data yield trees with good
resolution from higher-level groups down to closely
related species [8,9]. Although the Orthoptera encompasses about 22,500 described species in the world [10],
merely five complete mitochondrial genome sequences
were available in the GenBank when we started this study
(currently 12 species have been sequenced). The monophyly of Orthoptera has been widely accepted, and was
supported by morphological [11] and molecular data
[12]. However, the monophyly was not recovered in previous phylogenetic analyses based on mtDNA sequences
[13,14]. Recently, a study using mitochondrial genome
sequences confirmed the monophyly of Orthoptera [15].
One possible reason for such contrasting results may be
insufficient taxon sampling, with only a single species representing each of the two Orthoptera suborders in earlier

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/156

studies [13]. Thus, the addition of new complete mitochondrial genomes of orthopteran species will contribute
to understanding of phylogenetic relationships in the
Orthoptera and Insecta.
In this study, we determined the complete sequences of
the mitochondrial genomes of G. marmoratus and O. asiaticus, and compared in detail the full sequences of both
species. In addition, we analysed the phylogeny of 14
orthopteran species and 10 other polyneopteran species,
as well as 4 outgroup insect species based on a concatenation of 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes.

Methods
Samples and mitochondria isolation
Samples of G. marmoratus and O. asiaticus were collected
in Hainan (109.47°E, 19.02°N) and Inner Mongolia
(116.08°E, 43.94°N), China, respectively. They were preserved in 95% ethanol and maintained at 4°C. The mitochondria isolation for both species was performed
according to Tamura and Aotsuka [16], with some modifications. A small portion of muscle tissue from a single
individual was homogenized in 2 ml of chilled buffer (5
mM Tris, 70 mM sucrose, 220 mM Mannitol and 2 mM
EDTA, pH 7.4). The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 g
for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was recovered and
centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet the nuclei
and cellular debris. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet the mitochondria.
Mitochondrial DNA extraction
A modified method of salt-extraction protocol [17] was
used to extract mtDNA from the isolated mitochondria.
The mitochondria were resuspended in 330 μl of buffer
(pH 8.2) containing 100 mM Tris, 40 mM NaCl and 2 mM
EDTA. Then, 13 μl of 20% SDS and 6 μl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K were added to the mixture and incubated at
60°C for at least 2 hours or overnight, after which 250 μl
of 5.3 M NaCl was added. The mixture was centrifuged at
5,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and 480 μl of chilled isopropanol
was added and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4°C
to pellet mtDNA. The pellet was washed with 75% ethanol, dried and then resuspended in sterile ddH2O.
Genome determination and molecular analyses
Nine and seven pairs of PCR primers (See additional file
1: List of primers used for PCR amplification) were
designed to amplify overlapping segments of the entire
mitochondrial genomes of G. marmoratus and O. asiaticus,
respectively. Two fragments of about 4.5 kb were amplified using LA Taq™ (Takara Biomedical, Japan) with an
initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 30
cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C
for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 4.5 min, with a final

elongation at 72°C for 7 min after the last cycle. The other
fragments (~2 kb) were amplified using Takara EX Taq™
(Takara Biomedical, Japan) under the following conditions: 3 min at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at
94°C, 30 s at 50 – 55°C, 2 – 2.5 min at 72°C, and a final
extension period of 7 min at 72°C. After purification with
AxyPrep™ DNA Gel Extraction Kit, all PCR products were
sequenced directly by means of primer walking. Sequencing was performed using BigDye terminator chemistry
and ABI 3730x1 DNA Analyzer.

(Table 1). For outgroups, we excluded the taxa that had
been reported to introduce phylogenetic errors, based on
the following criteria [14]: extreme compositional bias,
inversion or translocation of genes on the opposite strand,
inversion of the A+T-rich region, or lack of atp8. As a
result, one species from Archaeognatha, one species from
Zygentoma, and two species from Hemiptera were
selected as outgroups. This selection appears appropriate
considering both insect phylogeny and outgroup choice
in previous studies [12,22].

Sequence data were assembled using SeqMan software
(DNAStar, Inc.). Transfer RNAs were identified by tRNAscan-SE 1.21 [18], and the other genes were determined by
comparison with those of the sequenced orthopterans.
Strand skew values were calculated according to the formulae by Perna et al. [19]. Divergences of cox1 sequences
were calculated using MEGA 4.1 Beta [20] with the
Kimura-2-Parameter model. The formula for calculating
the divergence in the sliding-window analysis was as per
Proutski et al. [21].

The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the proteincoding genes were retrieved from the Mitome database
[23]. The amino acid sequences were individually aligned
using BioEdit [24], followed by manual refinements. The
corresponding nucleotide sequences were retro-aligned,
using the PAL2NAL webserver [25], and then concatenated into a single alignment. With "codons" selected as
the type of sequence and other default options, the program Gblocks [26] was applied to remove poorly aligned
positions of the nucleotide alignment. Third codon positions were highly saturated as was determined by DAMBE
[27]. To investigate the effect of mutational saturation, we
employed phylogenetic analyses based on the two data
sets: (i) DNA alignment including only first and second

genomes available in the GenBank. Its relatively large size
is mainly owing to the extended A+T-rich region caused by
the presence of tandem repeats. Both mitochondrial
genomes share the same 37 typical metazoan genes (13
protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, and 2 ribosomal RNA genes) and an A+T-rich region [31], and they
have identical gene arrangement with L. migratoria
[32],Oxya chinensis [33], Chorthippus chinensis [34], Calliptamus italicus [15], and Acrida willemsei [15]. In addition
to the A+T-rich region, 72 and 98 noncoding nucleotides
are present in the mitochondrial genomes of G. marmoratus and O. asiaticus, respectively. There are overlapping
genes in both mitochondrial genomes as in other metazoan mitochondrial genomes. In G. marmoratus, the overlaps occur six times and involve a total of 35 bp, lacking
only one 1-bp overlap between trnQ and trnM compared
with O. asiaticus. These overlaps exist between atp8 and
atp6 on the majority strand, nad4L and nad4 on the
minority strand, and between some adjacent genes oriented on opposite strands.

tRNAscan-SE 1.21 [18], except for trnH in G. marmoratus
and trnS(AGN) in both mitochondrial genomes, which
were determined through sequence comparison with previously published orthopteran mitochondrial genomes.
Twenty-one tRNA genes can be folded into the typical cloverleaf structure, whereas trnS(AGN) in both mitochondrial genomes has an unpaired stretch of 11 nucleotides
instead of the DHU arm, as is often found in arthropod
mitochondrial genomes. Both mitochondrial genomes
have the identical nucleotide sequence for only
trnL(CUN). Unmatched base pairs have been observed in
stems of tRNA secondary structures. In G. marmoratus,
there are 22 unmatched base pairs, consisting of 19 G-U
pairs, 1 A-A and 2 U-U mismatches; whereas in the case of
O. asiaticus, 16 G-U pairs, 1 A-A and 3 U-U mismatches
have been identified. Their anticodons are identical to
those of all the other available orthopteran mitochondrial
genomes. Compared with the published ensiferan mitochondrial gene order cox2-trnK-trnD-atp8, there is a rearrangement of trnD and trnK in both G. marmoratus and O.
asiaticus mitochondrial genomes, as well as in those of all
the other caeliferans determined so far. This is consistent
with the previous finding that in the Orthoptera such rearrangement only occurs within the suborder Caelifera [36].

The nucleotide compositions of the entire mtDNA
sequences for G. marmoratus and O. asiaticus are significantly biased toward A and T. The A+T content is 75.18%
(A = 45.57%, T = 29.62%, C = 15.22%, G = 9.60%) in G.
marmoratus and 75.39% in O. asiaticus (A = 45.03%, T =
30.36%, C = 14.57%, G = 10.04%; see Table 3). On the
other hand, both of the majority strands of G. marmoratus
(AT-skew = 0.212, GC-skew = -0.226) and O. asiaticus (ATskew = 0.195, GC-skew = -0.184) favor A and C. In mammals, the underlying mechanism for this bias of strandspecific nucleotide composition is the deamination of C
and A in the H strand during replication [35].

The two genes encoding the large and small ribosomal
RNA subunits (rrnL and rrnS) are located between
trnL(CUN) and trnV, and between trnV and the A+T-rich
region, respectively. The length of rrnL is 1,322 bp in G.
marmoratus and 1,318 bp in O. asiaticus, with an A+T content of 78.14% and 78.15%, respectively. The rrnS is 831
bp in both mitochondrial genomes, and the A+T content
is 75.69% for G. marmoratus and 75.45% for O. asiaticus
(Table 3).

Transfer and ribosomal RNA genes
The complete set of 22 tRNA genes typical of metazoan
mitochondrial genomes is present in the two mitochondrial genomes: two for serine and leucine, and one for the
other amino acids. All tRNA genes were determined by

Protein-coding genes
All of the 13 G. marmoratus protein-coding genes start
with a typical ATN codon: two (nad3, nad5) with ATT, two
(cox1, atp8) with ATC and the other nine with ATG (Table

2). In comparison with G. marmoratus, merely nad1 in O.
asiaticus possesses a different initiation codon ATA. Previous studies reported no typical ATN initiation codon for
cox1 in mitochondrial genomes of many species. As a consequence, many other irregular initiation codons, such as
ATTA [37] and ATTTAA [38], were postulated. In G. marmoratus and O. asiaticus, however, the putative initiation
codon for cox1 is ATC, which is located 8-bp upstream of
the adjacent trnY. In the cox1 start region, L. migratoria has
an insert of 9 or 12 nucleotides compared with the other
orthopterans (Figure 1). The initiation codon for cox1
remains ambiguous in L. migratoria, where a 4-bp start
sequence, ATTA, has been proposed [32]. The counterparts for O. chinensis [33], C. italicus [15], and C. chinensis
[34] have been presumed to be ATC. Based on the cox1
sequence in A. willemsei (GenBank: NC_011303), ATC
could be regarded as the potential initiation codon. Therefore, the caeliferan species share the same initiation codon
ATC except for L. migratoria. In both mole crickets Gryllotalpa orientalis [13] and Gryllotalpa pluvialis [15], cox1 has a
canonical initiation codon ATG. The initiation codon is
ATC in the tettigoniid species like Myrmecophilus manni
[15] and ATT in both Troglophilus neglectus [15] and Gampsocleis gratiosa [39]. The triplet CCG has been identified as
the cox1 initiation codon for the cricket Anabrus simplex
[40]. Although the corresponding triplet is also CCG for
the katydid Ruspolia dubia, TTA has been proposed to initiate cox1 [41]. Annotation of a new mitochondrial

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/156

genome is commonly carried out by comparison with
closely related mitochondrial genomes already determined. This approach, therefore, has limitations to this
extent. The precise initiation codon for cox1 can be finally
determined by protein sequencing.
Seven of the 13 protein-coding genes terminate with the
conventional stop codons TAG or TAA, and the remaining
ones have incomplete stop codons T or TA adjacent to a
downstream tRNA gene (Table 2). The only difference in
stop codons between the two mitochondrial genomes lies
in that nad4 gene in G. marmoratus uses TAG, while the
stop codon is TAA in O. asiaticus. The secondary structure
of tRNA genes facilitates correct processing of the polycistronic transcript into mature RNA molecules [42]. The
presence of incomplete stop codon is common in metazoan mitochondrial genomes, and these truncated stop
codons are presumed to be completed via post-transcriptional polyadenylation [42]. In accordance with other
arthropods, overlapping protein-coding genes are present
in both G. marmoratus and O. asiaticus mitochondrial
genomes; a 7-bp overlap exists not only between atp8 and
atp6 but also between nad4L and nad4. In this case, hairpin structures forming at the 3' end of the upstream protein's mRNA, rather than secondary structures of tRNA
genes, may act as a signal for the cleavage of the polycistronic primary transcript [40].

A DNA barcoding approach based on cox1 sequence diversity has been utilized for identification of closely allied
species [43]. We calculated pairwise divergences of a 650bp sequence (corresponding to nucleotide positions
1428–2077 in G. marmoratus mitochondrial genome)
from the cox1 5' terminus in the fourteen known orthopteran mitochondrial genomes (See additional file 2: Pairwise divergences (%) of a 650-bp sequence from cox1 5'
terminus). Pairwise between the caeliferans and the ensiferans exhibits overall high divergences. The pairwise
divergences range from 11.04% to 31.65%, indicating
that this fragment of cox1 gene is effective enough to discriminate these species. However, whether the cox1 barcode sequence could be applied to the whole Orthoptera
requires broad taxon sampling.
The nucleotide sequence identities of G. marmoratus and
O. asiaticus protein-coding genes range from 84.3%
(nad6) to 92.1% (nad4L; see Table 4). Based on identity of
inferred amino acid sequences, cox1 (97.0%) is the most
conserved protein-coding gene, while atp8 (80.7%) is the
least conserved with a variable domain at the C-terminus.
The A+T content of protein-coding genes, excluding stop
codons, is 73.91% and 73.86% in G. marmoratus and O.
asiaticus, respectively (Table 3). This significant AT-bias
affects codon usage in proteins, with ATT (encoding isoleucine) being the most frequently used codon and GCrich codons being least frequently used (e.g., CGC is
absent in both mitochondrial genomes). In G. marmoratus
and O. asiaticus, when first, second and third codon positions are considered separately, the highest A+T content is
in third codon positions (86.52% and 87.30%, respectively), the strongest bias toward T is in second codon
positions (both 45.72%), and the lowest content of G is
in third codon positions (4.70% and 4.57%, respectively;
see Table 3).

The A+T-rich region
This region has an A+T content of 84.26% in G. marmoratus and 84.51% in O. asiaticus (Table 3). The A+T-rich
regions of two grasshopper species, Schistocerca gregaria
and Chorthippus parallelus, have been sequenced [44]. The
A+T-rich region, usually the largest noncoding part of the
metazoan mitochondrial DNA molecule, evolves relatively fast due to few selective constraints. For the orthopterans, a high mutation rate of this region results in
significant size variation ranging from 70 bp in the katydid R. dubia [41] to 1,512 bp in the grasshopper C. parallelus [44]. This variation is predominantly due to both
length variation within tandem repeats and differences in
their copy numbers.

In G. marmoratus, there are three tandem repeat units. The
first one begins in the rrnS gene and extends into the A+Trich region. The first two repeat units are 166 bp long and
identical in sequence, slightly different from the third one
(155 bp). The A+T content is 79.88% for these repeat
sequences and 87.68% for the A+T-rich region excluding
these repeat sequences. The longest open reading frame (255
bp in length, encoding 85 amino acids) detected in the A+Trich region is located in the minority strand of these tandem
repeats, but a tblastn research found no significant similarity
with sequences in the GenBank database, suggesting it is a
non-functional ORF. In O. asiaticus, the A+T-rich region contains two repeat regions. The first one (75.83% A+T) consists
of two complete repeat units (155 bp) and one truncated
repeat unit (141 bp), with 5 to 7 nucleotide substitutions
between them. Of these repeat units, the first one is partially
located in the rrnS gene. The minority strand of this repeat
region has the longest open reading frame (237 bp) of the
A+T-rich region, but we got negative results using the tblastn
research. The other repeat region (90.35% A+T), situated
near the trnI gene, comprises two repeat units (345 and 339
bp, respectively) with the shorter one truncated at 3' end.
Similar large tandem repeats are also present in the A+T-rich
region of L. migratoria, C. parallelus, T. neglectus and G. gratiosa but they are absent in the other orthopteran mitochondrial genomes determined so far. The fact that tandem
repeats are non-conserved among these orthopteran mitochondrial genomes indicates a lack of a functional role for
these tandem repeats. Replication slippage is regarded as a
dominant mechanism to account for the existence of tandem repeats [45,46].
The A+T-rich region contains control elements for replication and transcription of animal mitochondrial genomes
[31]. Of them, the stem-loop secondary structure is potentially involved in initiation of a second-strand replication
[44]. The possible stem-loop structure located immediately upstream of the origin of the minority strand has
been detected in L. migratoria [47]. Such stem-loop structures also exist in all the other previously determined
caeliferan mitochondrial genomes. For G. marmoratus and

O. asiaticus, using the program mfold [48], we have predicted the possible stem-loop structures, both of which
have the same secondary structure and nucleotide
sequence as that of L. migratoria. The conserved stem-loop
structures in these mitochondrial genomes suggest their
functional importance and may provide clues for understanding the initiation process of mtDNA replication.
Divergence of mtDNA sequences
A sliding-window analysis was performed to compute
divergence of the fourteen orthopteran mtDNA sequences
excluding the A+T-rich region (Figure 2). The mean divergence of the fourteen orthopteran mtDNA sequences is
0.405. The nad2 gene has undergone accelerated evolution, as evidenced by the highest level of divergence. The
cox1 gene is the most conserved protein-coding gene, and
is therefore a useful marker for investigating phylogenetic
relationships at higher taxonomic levels. Divergence of
mtDNA sequences of the seven caeliferans and the seven
ensiferans was also calculated, respectively (Figure 2). The
seven ensiferans has not only overall similar sequence
divergence pattern to that of the fourteen orthopterans
but much higher divergence (mean divergence = 0.378)
than the seven caeliferans (mean divergence = 0.196),

nad2

indicating that the high divergence of the fourteen orthopterans attributes to the ensiferan mtDNA sequence divergence. By contrast, mtDNA sequences of the caeliferans
are more conserved, except for sequences of nad2, nad4L,
and nad6. Due to the highest divergence, the nad2 nucleotide sequence can be used as an effective molecular
marker to analyse intraspecific relationships and to distinguish closely related grasshopper species.
Phylogenetic relationships
We performed phylogenetic analysis with nucleotide
sequences of 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes from
24 polyneopteran species and 4 outgroup insect species
(Philaenus spumarius [49],Triatoma dimidiate [50],Tricholepidion gertschi [9] and Nesomachilis australica [51]). BI and
ML analyses using only first and second codon positions
of the 13 protein-coding genes generate identical tree
topologies (Figure 3).

Polyneoptera refers to an assemblage of eleven insect
orders, and its monophyly remains contentious [22].
Using both morphological and molecular data, Wheeler
et al. [52] recovered monophyletic Polyneoptera. However, Terry & Whiting [22] supported the paraphyly of

Phylogenetic tree of 24 polyneopterans

probabilities (BPP; above nodes) and bootstrap support values (BS; below nodes).
Polyneoptera based on an extensive data set (18S rDNA,
28S rDNA, Histone 3 DNA sequences, and 125 morphological characters). In the present study, eight orders of the
polyneopteran lineages are included and they cluster as a
monophyletic clade (Figure 3). Our result may provide
evidence for resolving phylogenetic relationships of Polyneoptera, although the currently limited taxon sampling
highlights the preliminary nature of this analysis. The
unsampled Dermaptera, Embiidina, and Zoraptera,
should be included in further studies to provide a more
accurate phylogenetic estimate.
Dictyoptera (Isoptera, Blattaria, and Mantodea) is recovered as monophyletic (Figure 3), with Tamolanica
tamolana [53] (Mantodea) as sister taxon to Periplaneta
fuliginosa [54] (Blattaria) and four Reticulitermes species
[55] (Isoptera). The relationships within Dictyoptera are
in agreement with previous analyses [22]. The sister relationship between Mantophasmatodea and Phasmatodea
is supported and this clade is sister to Grylloblattodea
(Figure 3). Our result is consistent with previous analyses
using mitochondrial protein-coding genes [14,53], but
different from the study by Terry & Whiting [22] who suggested a sister-group relationship between Mantophasmatodea and Grylloblattodea.

Plecoptera, here represented by Pteronarcys princeps [56], is
sister group to the assemblage (((Mantophasmatodea +
Phasmatodea) + Grylloblattodea) + Dictyoptera), but the
low support values (BPP = 0.78, BS = 58%; see Figure 3)
suggest that the position of Plecoptera is not well resolved
in the phylogenetic analysis. Plecoptera has been proposed as the sister taxon to Dermaptera and Zoraptera
[22], whose mitochondrial genomes are not available.
Carapelli et al. [14] clustered P. princeps with Diptera
(flies) rather than polyneopterans, and detected no problematic characteristics within its mitochondrial genome.
Later, when examining the phylogenetic signal from mitochondrial genome data, Fenn et al. [15] found that P. princeps introduced instability in phylogenetic analysis
possibly due to base composition heterogeneity, and thus
they excluded it. To test the effect caused by P. princeps, in
the present study we have reconstructed the phylogeny by
removing P. princeps and compared it with the phylogeny
including this taxon. We find that exclusion of P. princeps
makes no difference in placement of all other taxa but
results in a more stable tree topology, as is evident from
higher nodal supports (See additional file 3: Phylogenetic
tree of Polyneoptera without Pteronarcys princeps).
Although P. princeps has not considerably affected phylogenetic inference in our study, sampling other closely

Page 9 of 12

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:156

related plecopterans might be a strategy for further
progress in the reconstruction of Polyneoptera phylogeny.
The two Orthoptera suborders, Caelifera and Ensifera, are
both recovered as monophyletic (the latter taxon with a
lower statistical support: BPP = 0.96, BS = 72%; see Figure
3). This result is consistent with traditional morphological
taxonomics and previous studies [57,58]. The sister taxon
relationship (BPP = 1.00, BS = 70%) between Caelifera
and Ensifera supports the monophyly of Orthoptera [1012,15]. Within Caelifera, five subfamilies of Acrididae are
represented and Oedipodinae occupies the basal position.
The ensiferan species split into two clades, (Tettigoniidae
+
Rhaphidophoridae)
and
(Gryllotalpidae
+
Myrmecophilidae), concordant with the study of Fenn et
al. [15]. In contrast with the failure to recover the monophyletic Orthoptera in previous mtDNA-based phylogenetic analyses [13,14], our study demonstrates that
analyses with only two species representing the Orthoptera may lead to false phylogenetic inferences. Nevertheless, given the more than 20,000 species of the
Orthoptera, the present taxon sampling is still far from
enough. To further clarify the phylogeny of the Orthoptera, more extensive sequencing of orthopteran mitochondrial genomes is required.
Our initial analysis using all codon positions of protein-coding genes leads to quite different tree topologies, compared
with the tree based on only first and second codon positions.
Neither the ML nor the BI tree recovers monophyletic
Orthoptera (See additional file 4: Phylogenetic trees of Polyneoptera using all codon positions of 13 protein-coding
genes). Furthermore, the assemblage (((Mantophasmatodea
+ Phasmatodea) + Grylloblattodea) + Dictyoptera) is sister
either to Caelifera (BS = 53%) in the ML tree or to the clade
of Ensifera and Plecoptera (BPP = 0.54) in the BI tree. It is
likely due to the mutational saturation of third codon positions plaguing the phylogenetic analysis and subsequently
decreasing support values. Therefore, the analysis using all
codon positions is not suitable in the context of our taxon
sampling, although Fenn et al. [15] found that inclusion of
third codon positions did not negatively affect phylogenetic
inference. Here, we regard the analysis using only first and
second positions as our best estimate.

Conclusion
The mitochondrial genomes of G. marmoratus and O. asiaticus have overall similarities. Both species, with other
grasshopper species, share the same mitochondrial
genome organization, which differs from that of the available ensiferan species by the translocation between trnD
and trnK. The potential initiation codon for cox1 gene in
G. marmoratus and O. asiaticus is ATC. In addition to stemloop structures in the A+T-rich region, another common
feature of both mitochondrial genomes is the existence of
tandem repeats, but the kinds of repeats and the copy

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/156

number of each repeat unit are variable. The sliding-window analysis reveals that mtDNA sequences of the analysed caeliferans have lower divergence than those of the
ensiferans. The nad2 nucleotide sequence may serve as an
effective marker to determine phylogenetic relationships
of intraspecies and closely related grasshopper species.
The phylogenetic analysis based on mtDNA sequences of
13 protein-coding genes confirms the monophyly of
Orthoptera. The analyses of G. marmoratus and O. asiaticus
mitochondrial genomes have added to our knowledge on
mitochondrial genomes of Orthoptera.
