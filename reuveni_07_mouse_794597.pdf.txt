Abstract
Background: The mapping of quantitative trait loci in rat and mouse has been extremely
successful in identifying chromosomal regions associated with human disease-related
phenotypes. However, identifying the specific phenotype-causing DNA sequence variations
within a quantitative trait locus has been much more difficult. The recent availability of genomic
sequence from several mouse inbred strains (including C57BL/6J, 129X1/SvJ, 129S1/SvImJ, A/J,
and DBA/2J) has made it possible to catalog DNA sequence differences within a quantitative trait
locus derived from crosses between these strains. However, even for well-defined quantitative
trait loci (<10 Mb) the identification of candidate functional DNA sequence changes remains
challenging due to the high density of sequence variation between strains.
Description: To help identify functional DNA sequence variations within quantitative trait loci
we have used the Ensembl annotated genome sequence to compile a database of mouse single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are predicted to cause missense, nonsense, frameshift, or
splice site mutations (available at http://bioinfo.embl.it/SnpApplet/). For missense mutations we
have used the PolyPhen and PANTHER algorithms to predict whether amino acid changes are
likely to disrupt protein function.
Conclusion: We have developed a database of mouse SNPs predicted to cause missense,
nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site mutations. Our analysis revealed that 20% and 14% of
missense SNPs are likely to be deleterious according to PolyPhen and PANTHER, respectively,
and 6% are considered deleterious by both algorithms. The database also provides gene
expression and functional annotations from the Symatlas, Gene Ontology, and OMIM databases
to further assess candidate phenotype-causing mutations. To demonstrate its utility, we show
that Mouse SNP Miner successfully finds a previously identified candidate SNP in the taste
receptor, Tas1r3, that underlies sucrose preference in the C57BL/6J strain. We also use Mouse
SNP Miner to derive a list of candidate phenotype-causing mutations within a previously
uncharacterized QTL for response to morphine in the 129/Sv strain.

Background
The laboratory mouse is a powerful model for studying
the genetic determinants of human disease-related phenotypes. One way to study genetic modifiers of such phenotypes is to take advantage of genetic variations existing
between mouse inbred strains to map chromosomal
regions, or loci, that are associated with quantitative traits,
so-called quantitative trait loci (QTL). Over 2,000 QTL are
listed in the Mouse Genome Informatics database [1], and
many of these are relevant to human disease.
However, the identification of causal functional DNA polymorphisms underlying QTL has remained problematic,
with such variations having been convincingly identified
for no more than 9 QTL [2]. This difficulty stems largely
from the considerable size of typical QTL (10–50 Mb) and
the large number of sequence variations that lie within
such a region. In most cases, gene discovery for QTL is carried out by congenic mapping to narrow down the QTL
region to less than 5 Mb, followed by gene expression and
coding sequence analysis of each gene in the interval to
narrow down a list of candidate genes. Finally, the most
promising candidates are tested by genetic complementation or epistasis in transgenic animals. Several methods
are helping to speed the process of narrowing down QTL
to <5 Mb, including mapping in chromosome substitution strains [3], heterogeneous stocks [4], and advanced
intercrosses [5]. The construction of large panels of
recombinant inbred strains (>500 lines) are in progress
and promise to facilitate rapid high-resolution mapping
[6].
Recently, the nearly complete genome sequences of four
mouse inbred strains (129X1/SvJ, 129S1/SvImJ, A/J, DBA/
2J; [7]) joined the public reference sequence (C57BL/6J;
[8]) in open-access genome databases. Complete knowledge of the DNA sequence variation between strains
allows for a systematic search of all candidate sequence
polymorphisms within a QTL for putative functional polymorphisms [9-11]. When coupled with gene annotation,
this information can be used to identify polymorphisms
likely to cause changes in gene function and thus likely to
contribute to the QTL. Single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) that cause nonsense or missense mutations can be
reliably identified and often are responsible for severe
changes in protein function. Among 9 identified causal
QTL mutations, 2 are missense mutations, 2 are non-sense
mutations, and 1 is a frameshift mutation demonstrating
that these classes of overt coding sequence mutations contribute to QTL phenotypes, at least for QTL of large effect
size [2]. It is unclear in this point what fraction of the
>2000 reported mouse QTL are caused by overt coding
sequence mutations, and it is likely that functional noncoding mutations contribute significantly to these traits.
However, the success of finding at least some functional

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/24

coding sequence mutations underlying QTL coupled with
the much greater reliability with which such mutations
can be identified at the present time suggests that searching for functional coding mutations is a worthwhile initial
approach for QTL analysis.
Several authors have used the Celera Discovery System
[12] database to identify putative missense and nonsense
SNPs within QTL [13-16]. Beginning with Mouse Build
126, December 2006, the public SNP repository, dbSNP
[17], has incorporated all Celera sequence reads from
129X1/SvJ, 129S1/SvImJ, A/J, and DBA/2J and thus provides free access to genomic sequence from several inbred
strains. Both the Ensembl and NCBI genome portals offer
search tools that allow comparison of SNPs between
mouse inbred strains, called TranscriptSNPView [18] and
SNPviewer [19], respectively. SNP calls from dbSNP are
mapped onto the Ensembl or NCBI annotated mouse
genome to make predictions about the functional consequence of each SNP. We chose to use genome annotations
from Ensembl because it provides open access to its
MySQL database and associated API interface [20].
Although these databases allow searching of SNPs according to specific criteria (e.g., chromosome location, pairwise strain comparison, etc.), neither of them provides
additional annotations for SNPs, such as deleterious/nondeleterious for missense mutations, gene expression data,
or relevance to human disease.
To address this need, we sought to build a database of
mouse inbred strain SNPs predicted to cause functional
changes in protein sequence, including missense, nonsense, and splice site mutations, that could be easily
searched by strain, type, chromosomal location and functional consequence. In addition, we applied the bioinformatics algorithms PolyPhen [21] and PANTHER [22] to
predict whether missense mutations among these SNPs
were likely to disrupt protein function. PolyPhen analysis
of human SNPs showed that 17% of a selected set of 9,165
human non-synonymous coding SNPs are 'possibly damaging' and 13% are 'probably damaging' to protein function. These data confirmed earlier reports suggesting that
only a small fraction of missense mutations interfere with
protein function. We reasoned that a similar analysis of
mouse missense SNPs could help to narrow down candidate causal SNPs within QTL. The PANTHER algorithm
offers a complementary functional assessment of putative
missense SNPs [22] and a comparison of PolyPhen and
PANTHER predictions for human missense SNPs demonstrated a close correlation between these predictions and
empirical assessments of protein activity [23]. The recent
deposition of Celera sequence reads from the 129X1/SvJ,
129S1/SvImJ, A/J, and DBA/2J mouse inbred strains into
the public domain has made it possible for us to develop
a database of mouse SNPs that incorporates both

Polyphen and PANTHER missense SNP functional predictions as well as other gene function annotations.

Construction and content

data include both categorical, 'absent'/'present' calls, as
well as quantitative Affymetrix values for a large set of
embryonic, neonatal and adult mouse tissues. A schematic of the database is shown in Figure 1.

To assemble mouse SNPs for our database, we used Perl
scripts and MySQL queries to retrieve SNPs from the
Ensembl 'core', 'variation' and 'mart' databases (Ensembl
v37, February 2006 and dbSNP v125) that differ between
28 commonly used inbred strains. Ensembl annotations
were used to classify SNPs as putative coding or non-coding mutations and for coding variants, as synonymous,
non-synonymous (missense), STOP-gained, STOP-lost,
splice-site, or frameshift. For non-synonymous mutations, information about the assignment of amino acid
variants to the corresponding mouse strain was not available in Ensembl v37 and had to be derived by mapping
the chromosomal location of the mutation onto a translation of the associated transcript. Related strains were
grouped together so as to allow convenient searching for
SNPs differing between strain families (i.e. C57% =
'C57BL/6J', 'C57BL/10J', 'C57BL/10SnJ', etc.). We have
also incorporated sequence coverage details when available in order to confer SNP reliability. Table 1 summarizes
the number of putative functional SNPs for three strain
comparisons, C57BL/6J vs. DBA/2J, C57BL/6J vs. 129S1/
SvImJ, and C57BL/6J vs. A/J. For each gene in the database, annotations from several databases were extracted
and deposited in our database: 1) gene ontology (GO)
categories [24], 2) Symatlas gene expression data [25],
and 3) OMIM human disease phenotypes [26]. Symatlas

For missense mutations, functionality prediction was performed with the algorithms PolyPhen [21] v1.12 (based
on March 2006 releases of UniProt [27], NCBI nrdb [28],
PDB [29] and DSSP databases [30]) and PANTHER [22]
(based on PANTHER HMM library v6.0). PolyPhen is a
computational tool for identification of potentially functional nsSNPs. Predictions are based on a combination of
phylogenetic, structural and sequence annotation information characterizing a substitution and its position in
the protein. For a given amino acid variation, PolyPhen
performs several steps: (a) extraction of sequence-based
features of the substitution site from the UniProt database, (b) calculation of profile scores for two amino acid
variants, (c) calculation of structural parameters and contacts of a substituted residue. PANTHER Version 6.0
library contains a set of over 5,000 protein families and
about 30,000 subfamilies derived from those families,
each represented by a multiple sequence alignment and
Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The subfamilies are a
subset of selected proteins that can be associated with
functional classification (cellular process and molecular
function) using manual expert curation. Missense SNPs
can be scored against these HMM families to estimate
their likelihood of disrupting conserved amino acid elements, and thus protein function [22].

Mouse SNP Miner database structure
Mouse SNP Miner database structure. The core database consists of a MySQL relational database containing information
associated with predicted functional mouse SNPs from a selected set of mouse inbred strains. A web-based Java Applet module
allows querying, visualization, and downloading of information from the database. Basic information about SNP sequence, location, functional consequence, and associated transcript are derived from private and public sequencing efforts via the dbSNP
mouse polymorphism collection mapped onto the annotated Ensembl genome. Additional SNP information was extracted from
the OMIM, Symatlas, and GO databases. GO clustering by GeneMerge is queried directly by the Applet viewer prior to downloading. PolyPhen assessment of missense mutation consequence was based on Nrdb orthologous protein alignments, PDB
structure information, and protein functional annotation from Uniprot. PANTHER assessment of missense mutation consequence was based on a set of HMM protein alignments. Bold font and arrows pointing out of the database indicate the existence of direct web links from our database to associated database entries.

PolyPhen scores were classified as 'benign', 'possibly damaging', or 'probably damaging' and PANTHER scores as
'non-deleterious' or 'deleterious' following previously
described criteria [22]. For both algorithms, a label of
'unknown' was assigned in cases where insufficient annotations or orthologs existed to draw conclusions about
functionality of amino acid variants. The PANTHER algorithm tended to result in a greater number of 'unknown'
variants presumably because the HMM library search was
more stringent that the BLAST search used by PolyPhen
and thus more variants lacked sufficient homologs for

comparative analysis. A summary of PolyPhen and PANTHER predictions for three inbred strain comparisons is
shown in Table 2. Of a total of 27,143 missense SNPs in
the database, PolyPhen predicted 5,302 (20%) to be 'possibly damaging' or 'probably damaging' (deleterious),
19,390 (72%) as 'benign' (non-deleterious), and 2,260
(8%) as 'unknown'. PANTHER predicted 3,770 (14%) to
be 'deleterious', 13553 (50%) as 'non-deleterious', and
9444 (35%) as 'unknown'. More than 6% of missense
SNPs were classified as deleterious, and 42% as non-deleterious by both PolyPhen and PANTHER (Table 3). The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/24

smaller fraction of PolyPhen 'deleterious' calls that are
considered 'deleterious' by PANTHER is likely at least in
part to be due to the greater number of 'unknown' PANTHER calls. Finally, a search of the OMIM database [26]
for genes harboring predicted damaging SNPs (splice site,
frameshift, STOP-gain, STOP-lost, and probably or possibly damaging missense as called by PolyPhen) retrieved
entries for 803 genes (Table 4). This finding suggests that
genetic variation among mouse inbred strains may serve
as a promising tools to model human disease-relevant
phenotypes.
All the above data were stored in a MySQL database available online via a web interface. A Java Applet allows
searching of the SNP database by strain, functional type
(e.g. missense, STOP-gain), functional consequence (e.g.
deleterious, non-deleterious), chromosomal location, GO
accession number, QTL symbol or name, and re-sequencing coverage (where available), and GO or OMIM keywords (Figure 2). Browsing of retrieved SNPs is facilitated
by a graphical display in which retrieved SNPs are dis-

played chromosome-by-chromosome. Zooming is facilitated by directly selecting a region of the chromosome for
enlargement. Buttons allow chromosome walking to the
right or left, in-and-out zooming, and jumping between
adjacent SNPs. Changes in SNP retrieval criteria are immediately reflected in the graphical display making it possible to quickly view different sets of SNPs for a given
chromosomal region. Clicking on a SNP marker in the
graphical display returns a summary of relevant SNP and
gene annotations. Several links are provided within the
SNP summary table, including links to the Ensembl SNP
View, Ensembl Transcript View, Ensembl TranscriptSNPView, Symatlas expression data, GO terms and OMIM
entries.
Annotations for a selected set of SNPs can be conveniently
exported in tab-delimited format for offline analysis. The
export summary file provides dbSNP accession numbers,
functional type and consequence, gene accession description information, GO terms, and OMIM description (if
available) for each SNP. In addition, Symatlas expression

Both quantitative expression data (adjusted signal intensity) as well as qualitative expression data (present/

tional SNPs with gene expression, GO, and OMIM data to
allow searching and browsing by these criteria. The integration of these annotations into a single SNP repository
facilitates the rapid scanning of SNPs within an interval of
interest for candidate phenotype-causing mutations.
We assessed the utility of our database by using it to identify candidate phenotype-causing SNPs for one previously
cloned and one as yet uncloned mouse QTL. Free choice
sucrose preference varies significantly between mouse
inbred strains and a QTL determining sucrose preference
between high and low sucrose preferring strains (e.g.
C57BL/6J and 129P3/J, respectively) was localized to the
1.2 Mb interval between markers D4Mit256 and 139J18
[32]. Using congenic 129.B6 mice in which a 194 kb
genomic segment from the C57BL/6J strain was introgressed into the 129P3/J strain and which displayed high
sucrose preference, a region containing twelve predicted
genes was identified [32]. One of these genes, Tas1r3,
encodes a taste receptor family member and contains several missense mutations (Thr55Ala, Ile60Thr) that segregate with sucrose preference among six inbred strains
[32]. The genomic location, primary protein sequence,
and existence of non-synonymous mutations were used as
evidence that mutations in Tas1r3 underlie this QTL. Subsequently mice lacking Tas1r3 were engineered and confirmed to display decreased sucrose preference [33].

Utility
We assembled a database of predicted functional SNPs
deriving from 28 mouse inbred strains. We used the bioinformatics algorithms PolyPhen and PANTHER to assess
whether predicted missense mutations are likely to alter
protein function. This database is intended to help in the
identification of candidate functional SNPs underlying
QTL between mouse inbred strains.
Two features make our database unique. First, we performed bioinformatics-based estimations of functional
consequence for missense mutations using the PolyPhen
and PANTHER algorithms. These estimations show that
~28% of missense coding SNPs are deleterious to protein
function according to at least one of the two prediction
algorithms and ~6% are deleterious according to both
algorithms. These predictions can be used to help focus
studies on those SNPs within a QTL that are most likely to
alter protein function. Second, we have annotated func-

To test whether Mouse SNP Miner could be used to draw
similar conclusions without the need for high resolution
mapping using congenic mice, we analyzed putative functional SNPs between C57BL/6J and 129 strains for the
entire 1.2 Mb QTL between D4Mit256 and 139J18. Search
of the Mouse SNP Miner database identified 14 putative

data demonstrated that Mxra8 was widely expressed in the
mouse, with highest expression in adult lung. An intronless Mxra8 pseudogene encoded on the reverse strand
contained a putative premature termination codon
(Trp14*) in the 129X1/J strain but Symatlas data suggested that the transcript was not detectably expressed
even in tissue from C57BL/6J. As expected, the Tas1r3

functionality could not be determined for seven further
SNPs (Ccnl2, Mxra8, Tas1r3, and Ube2j2). The deleterious Ile706Thr mutation in Tas1r3 was found in all low
sucrose preferring strains for which sequence is available
in our database (129X1/J, 129S1/SvImJ, DBA2/J, and A/J).
Interestingly, the Ile706Thr mutation in Tas1r3 was not
previously reported by researchers studying the sucrose
preference QTL, while the Thr55Ala and Ile60Thr mutations previously proposed to contribute to the QTL [32]
were either not present in the public databases or predicted to be non-deleterious, respectively. Thus, our analysis suggests that the previously undescribed Ile706Thr
transmembrane mutation may contribute to, or even be
the primary variation underlying the sucrose preference
QTL. These findings demonstrate that our database is able
to correctly identify a previously identified candidate gene
within a 1.2 Mb QTL interval containing over 50 genes.
Furthermore, identification of a putative functional SNP
underlying the QTL was achieved without the need for
laborious congenic mapping or locus sequencing.
Next, we used Mouse SNP Miner to derive candidate genes
for a previously uncharacterized QTL affecting morphine
consumption [34]. F2 and recombinant inbred mapping
experiments between C57BL/6 and DBA/2 strains were
used to identify a 29 Mb QTL that lies between D10Mit3
and the distal tip of chromosome 10 and influences preference for morphine over quinine. These data were confirmed by data showing that congenic B6.D2 mice in
which a 28 Mb fragment from the distant tip of chromosome 10 from DBA/2 was introgressed onto C57BL/6J
showed morphine consumption resembling DBA/2 [34].
Using Mouse SNP Miner, we retrieved 22 putative functional SNPs differing between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J and
lying between 0 and 28,841,602 bp on chromosome 10.
Of these 22 SNPs located in 14 transcripts, 14 were considered non-deleterious, 3 were considered deleterious,
and 5 were unknown. One of the deleterious mutations
(Arg274Gln) was located in an intronless mouse heat
shock-related protein, Q3UBR0, in the DBA/2J strain. Variations in this gene are unlikely to contribute to the morphine QTL because its mRNA was absent from mouse
tissues according to Symatlas. The remaining deleterious
mutations were found in the orphan G-protein coupled
receptor, Gpr126 (Gly196Asp), and synaptic nuclear
envelope protein 1, Syne1 (Arg386Gln), with the deleterious variant in both cases found in DBA/2J. The mutation
in Syne1 lies within a splice variant expressed in cardiac
and skeletal muscle, but not brain, and is thus not likely
to contribute to the QTL [35]. Gpr126 is a member of the
adhesion family of GPCRs [36] and is specifically

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/24

expressed in placenta, fetal lung and liver, and olfactory
epithelium where it could contribute to alterations in
olfactory perception. These findings lead us to propose
that Gpr126 is a candidate gene for the morphine consumption QTL and demonstrate the power of our database to rapidly screen through SNPs within large QTL to
derive candidate genes for further testing. However it is
important to point out that the retrieval of candidate SNPs
using Mouse SNP Miner is necessarily limited by the
extent of sequence coverage for the strains selected and in
the particular chromosome regions studied. Although
sequencing coverage is rapidly improving, in some cases
coverage is still very poor and in these cases candidate
genetic variations are likely to be overlooked. It is also
important to reiterate the fact that genetic variation other
than overtly detrimental coding sequence SNPs contribute to QTL phenotypes. At the moment such variations are
not included in the Mouse SNP Miner database. Moreover, care must be exercised when interpreting mRNA
expression levels from Symatlas, as microarray data is particularly prone to false negative results.

Discussion
A large public effort to determine the complete sequences
of over 15 inbred mouse strains is presently underway
[37]. The inclusion of these data into future versions of
our database will dramatically increase its utility and versatility. In addition the further incorporation of new
genomic sequences from related species will help improve
the power of the PolyPhen and PANTHER algorithms to
estimate functionality of amino acid substitutions, as this
process for the most part relies on sequence homology.
Several additional features of our database could warrant
improvement. First, links between SNPs and Symatlas
expression data for the relevant transcript in our current
database version rely on Ensembl stable transcript IDs.
Due to frequent changes in Ensembl IDs, in some cases we
failed to retrieve expression data even when the data
existed in Symatlas. A referencing system using Affymetrix
probes could circumvent this problem and in addition
would provide probe-specific expression data that could
be correlated with SNP position in the transcript. Second,
it is likely that functional non-coding mutations also contribute significantly to QTL phenotypes [2]. The functional consequence of genetic variation in gene regulatory
elements, for example, could be assessed using information from transcription factor binding site databases, and
such information could be incorporated into future versions of Mouse SNP Miner. Third, the inclusion of data
from additional missense SNP functional prediction algorithms, such as SIFT [38], could be envisioned. Like
PolyPhen and PANTHER, SIFT uses sequence conservation to predict functional consequences, but differs in the
way it assembles protein alignments. Fourth, as additional
re-sequencing data becomes available and incorporated

into Mouse SNP Miner, false positive SNPs due to
sequencing errors and false negative SNPs due to incomplete genome sequence will diminish. Moreover, the
inclusion of sequence from additional inbred strains will
assure that a larger fraction of known QTL will become
amenable to study using our database. Finally, we are
aware that in some cases amino acid calls derived from
our translation of Ensembl transcripts contain errors due
to transcript direction. Ensembl v41 (October 2006)
includes amino acid strain assignments for missense SNPs
and should allow us to correct this deficit.

Conclusion
The Mouse SNP Miner database contains mouse SNPs predicted to cause missense, STOP-gain, STOP-lost,
frameshift, and splice-site mutations. The database provides several annotations for each SNP, including
PolyPhen and PANTHER predictions of missense mutation consequence and gene expression data from Symatlas. Our database allows convenient searching of mouse
functional SNPs by strain, chromosomal location, type,
predicted functional consequence, gene expression, GO
and OMIM terms. The database provides an overview of
the extent of functional coding sequence variation
between mouse inbred strains and will help to speed the
identification of candidate genetic variations that underlie
mouse QTL.
