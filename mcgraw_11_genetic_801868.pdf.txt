A genetic linkage map and comparative mapping
of the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) genome
Lisa A McGraw1, Jamie K Davis2, Larry J Young1,3 and James W Thomas2*

Abstract
Background: The prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) is an emerging rodent model for investigating the genetics,
evolution and molecular mechanisms of social behavior. Though a karyotype for the prairie vole has been reported
and low-resolution comparative cytogenetic analyses have been done in this species, other basic genetic resources
for this species, such as a genetic linkage map, are lacking.
Results: Here we report the construction of a genome-wide linkage map of the prairie vole. The linkage map
consists of 406 markers that are spaced on average every 7 Mb and span an estimated ~90% of the genome. The
sex average length of the linkage map is 1707 cM, which, like other Muroid rodent linkage maps, is on the lower
end of the length distribution of linkage maps reported to date for placental mammals. Linkage groups were
assigned to 19 out of the 26 prairie vole autosomes as well as the X chromosome. Comparative analyses of the
prairie vole linkage map based on the location of 387 Type I markers identified 61 large blocks of synteny with the
mouse genome. In addition, the results of the comparative analyses revealed a potential elevated rate of inversions
in the prairie vole lineage compared to the laboratory mouse and rat.
Conclusions: A genetic linkage map of the prairie vole has been constructed and represents the fourth genomewide high-resolution linkage map reported for Muroid rodents and the first for a member of the Arvicolinae subfamily. This resource will advance studies designed to dissect the genetic basis of a variety of social behaviors and
other traits in the prairie vole as well as our understanding of genome evolution in the genus Microtus.

Background
Genomes evolve by a number of molecular mechanisms
including chromosomal rearrangements [1]. The genomes of rodents, in particular Muroid rodents (superfamily: Muroidea) have been shown to have elevated
rates of chromosomal rearrangements compared to
most other placental mammals (e.g. [2]). Though the
genome sequence of just two Muroid rodents, the
laboratory mouse (Mus musculus) and rat (Rattus norvegicus), are currently available [3,4], interspecies comparisons based on cross-species comparative chromosome
painting has provided a low-resolution view of the similarities and differences in genome organization in a
number of species within this super-family (e.g. [5]).
The genus Microtus is comprised of 62 species of
voles and is one of the most, if not the most, speciose

Muroid genus [6,7]. Microtus is particularly interesting
to study with respect to the process of genome evolution because the rate of speciation in this genus is estimated to be 20-fold higher than the average mammalian
lineage [8] and because their genomes have been associated with rapid rates of evolution [8,9]. Comparisons
of G-banded karyotypes, cross-species chromosome
painting, and multi-color banding has yielded a lowresolution view of how the karyotypes within the Microtus genus differ from one another, the likely number
and type of large-scale chromosomal rearrangements
that have led to those observed differences, as well as
the reconstruction of a proposed ancestral Microtus
genome [10-15]. In addition, cross-species chromosome
painting studies have been used to establish synteny
maps between Microtus genomes and that of the mouse
[14,15]. However, a higher resolution map, such as a
genetic linkage map, that could reveal additional insights
into the rates and patterns of genome evolution within
the Microtus genus has not reported.

The North American prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) is an emerging model for studying the genetic and
molecular bases of social behavior and how it evolves
[16]. Breeding colonies of prairie voles have been used
in a laboratory research setting for more than 40 years
(e.g. [17]) and a karyotype for the prairie vole was first
reported in 1974 [18]. However, despite the history of
breeding prairie voles in captivity and interest in the
genetic basis of inherited traits in this species [17,18],
no genetic linkage map has been constructed for the
prairie vole. Previously we reported a low-resolution
comparative cytogenetic map between the prairie vole
and the laboratory mouse [19]. With the goal of developing additional genetic resources for this species and
for facilitating studies of genome evolution in this lineage, here we describe the construction of a linkage map
of the prairie vole (2N = 54) and comparative analyses
of this genome with respect to the laboratory mouse
(2N = 40) and rat (2N = 42), as well as other Microtus
genomes.

Results
Genotyping and SNP features

A total of 624 SNPs were genotyped on a panel of 353
prairie voles. After applying quality control measures
and other filters to the genotyping results, the final data
set used for the linkage mapping included the genotypes
of 431 SNPs from 285 individuals (see Materials and
Methods). Most (n = 392) of the prairie vole loci tagged
by the filtered set of SNPs could be assigned an orthologous position in the mouse genome, i.e., Type I markers
(e.g. [20]). The average physical spacing of Type I markers along each mouse chromosome varied from 4.8 to
16.7 Mb, for an average spacing across the genome of
one marker every 6.9 Mb. Note that 284 of the Type I
markers are within genes (Additional File 1).
Linkage groups and chromosomal assignments

Thirty-five linkage groups that included a total of 406
SNPs were identified (Figure 1 and 2, and see Table 1
for a summary of the number of informative meioses).
The total length of the sex-averaged genetic map is
1707 cM. The majority of the chromosome and linkage
groups (24 of 36) are longer in females than males, and
the total length of the female and male autosomal maps
are 1885 and 1575 cM, respectively. In order to anchor
the linkage groups to chromosomes, we integrated mapping information from the Type I markers in the linkage
groups with a previously published low-resolution comparative cytogenetic map of the prairie vole genome
[19]. By using the integrated mapping data, we were
able to confidently assign 22 linkage groups to 19 of the
26 prairie vole autosomes and one linkage group to the
X chromosome (Figure 1 and 2 and Additional File 2).

Page 2 of 10

Prairie vole chromosomes 11, 12, 20, 23 and 25 could
not be associated with a linkage group due to an
absence of cytogenetic data. Linkage groups could not
be assigned to chromosomes 3, 9 and 13 due to uninformative or conflicting genetic and cytogenetic data (see
Additional File 2). Conversely, thirteen linkage groups
could not be associated with a specific chromosome
because of a lack of definitive cytogenetic data (see
Additional File 2).
Comparative analyses

The physical linkage, and to a lesser extent the order of
genes tend to be conserved between mammalian genomes (e.g. [21]). Of the Type I markers in the prairie vole
linkage map, 89% (345/387) fall within 61 blocks of conserved synteny with mouse that combined span 1.7 Gb
(Figure 1, 2 and 3). These blocks of conserved synteny
range in length from 46 kb to 143 Mb and are on average
28 Mb. Within the regions of conserved synteny are 91
segments in which the marker order is identical in the
prairie vole linkage map and sequenced mouse genome.
These segments of conserved gene order range in size
from 20 kb to 76 Mb and average 11 Mb (Figure 3).
The differences in linkage and the order of loci
between the prairie vole and mouse genomes are a
reflection of chromosomal rearrangements that have
occurred since the divergence of the lineages leading to
these species. Based on a pairwise comparison of the
marker order in the prairie vole linkage map to that in
the sequenced mouse genome, the GRIMM algorithm
[22] estimated a total of 177 rearrangements between
these genomes. Similarly, 198 rearrangements were estimated to have occurred between the prairie vole and rat
genomes. In order to reconstruct the history of the
chromosomal rearrangements that led to the differences
between these rodent genomes, we applied the MGR
algorithm [23] to a four-way comparison between the
prairie vole, mouse, rat, and human genomes (Figure 4).
Significantly more rearrangements are predicted to have
occurred in the prairie vole versus the mouse/rat
lineages (Figure 4, c2 test, p < 0.012). This difference is
primarily due to an estimated higher rate of inversions
in the prairie vole versus the mouse/rat lineages (c2 test,
p < 0.0003, Figure 4A), whereas no significant difference
is detectable with respect to the number of inter-chromosomal rearrangements, i.e. translocations, fissions and
fusions (c2 test, p > 0.64, Figure 4B).

Discussion
Genome-wide genetic linkage maps including hundreds
of markers have been constructed for a number of placental mammals [24-38]. Among those species, Muroid
rodents tend to have shorter genetic linkage maps than
most other placental mammals, which could be

within this super-family. The length calculated for the
sex-averaged prairie vole linkage map is 1707 cM. The
prairie vole linkage map is therefore longer than those
of the previously sampled Muroid rodents, i.e, 11111647 cM [24,27,28], but shorter than the map lengths
reported in 13 out of 15 other placental mammals, i.e.

Figure 4 Reconstruction of chromosomal rearrangements
between the prairie vole and mouse genomes. The estimated
number of chromosomal rearrangements between the human,
mouse, rat and prairie vole genomes and the lineages in which
they are predicted to occur are listed above the branches on the
phylogenetic tree. A) Intra-chromosomal (inversions). B) Interchromosomal (translocations, fusions and fissions).

American mink and silver fox, which have map lengths
of 1340 cM and 1480 cM, respectively [37,38]. Based on
the syntenic locations of the Type I markers in the genome of the laboratory mouse, we estimate the linkage
map reported here spans ~89% of the prairie vole genome. Thus we believe our observed map length for the
prairie vole is a fairly accurate reflection of the true
genetic map length. In addition, the length of the prairie
vole linkage map is consistent with the previous observation that Muroid rodent genomes tend to have shorter
genetic linkage maps than most placental mammals that
have been sampled to date. This observation is likely
because rodents tend to possess a larger number of
acrocentric chromosomes resulting in fewer cross-over
events relative to higher order mammals [39].
Our comparative analyses revealed 61 blocks of conserved synteny between the prairie vole and mouse that
together span the majority of those genomes. Not surprisingly, the largest block of conserved synteny was
associated with the X chromosome. Other chromosomes, in particular MMU3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14 and 16,
were also associated with blocks of conserved synteny >
50 Mb corresponding to prairie vole chromosomes 21,
LG5/10, 14, 22, 5, 1, 15 and 17, respectively, including

Page 6 of 10

an 76 Mb segment of MMU14 in which the order of
the markers was the same as on prairie vole chromosome 17. We further estimate that 177 to 201 chromosomal rearrangements have occurred in the 24 million
years since the most recent common ancestor of the
prairie vole and laboratory mouse [40]. It should be
noted, however, that our comparative analyses did not
have unlimited resolution, as would be the case when
comparing a pair of sequenced and assembled genomes.
As such, there are most certainly other large chromosomal rearrangements between the genomes of the prairie
vole and laboratory mouse that would not have been
detected in our study. For example, the number of chromosomal rearrangements between the genomes of the
laboratory mouse and rat estimated by GRIMM and
MGR based solely on our Type I markers included in
the prairie vole linkage map are 71 to 81, respectively,
and are thus lower than the estimated 100 to 107 rearrangements between those rodents that were based on
alignments of the genome sequence assemblies [41].
Therefore, with the caveat that the prairie vole linkage
map is likely to contain some errors with respect to the
true maker order in the genome (see Discussion below),
our estimates of the number of chromosomal rearrangements between the genomes of the prairie vole and
laboratory mouse and rat are likely reasonable underestimates of the approximate number of large chromosomal rearrangements that distinguish the karyotypes of
these species.
The rate of chromosomal rearrangements varies across
the mammalian phylogeny [2]. From our comparison of
the prairie vole linkage map to that of sequenced
mouse, rat and human genomes, we were able to detect
a significant difference in the rate of chromosomal rearrangements in the prairie vole lineage compared to that
of the laboratory mouse/rat (Murinae) lineage. In particular, the number of inversions in the prairie vole lineage was much higher than that observed in the Murinae
lineage (Figure 4). This observation could therefore be a
true indicator of an increase in the rate of inversions in
the prairie vole lineage, a relative decrease in the rate of
inversions in the Murinae lineage, or both. Alternatively,
while Microtus genomes have previously been reported
to be rapidly evolving [8,9], it is possible that the number of inversions estimated in this study is artificially
inflated due to the limited power to accurately order
closely linked loci with the pedigree-based linkage map.
Future comparative analyses of the pending genome
assembly of the prairie vole http://www.genome.gov/
10002154 along with the genome of another member of
the Cricetidae family, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), should be able to address this question further
and better resolve when shifts in the rate of genome
evolution may have occurred.

Comparative analyses of G-banded karyotypes from a
number of Arvicolid rodents, including the prairie vole
and other members of the Microtus genus, identified
derived characteristics of the prairie vole genome [10].
More recently, comparative analysis of several Microtus
genomes other than the prairie vole by cross-species
chromosome painting has led to the reconstruction of a
putative ancestral Microtus karyotype [12]. While we
cannot directly compare the results of our comparative
mapping data with those previously reported due to differences in methodology, an attempt to integrate and
synthesize the genome mapping results of the prairie
vole and other Microtus genomes with respect to our
higher-resolution comparative mapping results is of
potential value. For example, by using synteny maps
with the laboratory mouse reported here for the prairie
vole and previously for other voles as a common point
of reference [14], we predict that the putative ancestral
Microtus autosomes 2, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 19, 21, 23 and
24 proposed in [12] are likely orthologous to prairie
vole chromosomes 2, 6, 7, 8, 18, 16, 17, 15, LG2, 22 and
21, respectively. In addition, prairie vole chromosomes 1
and 4 likely represent derived fissions of ancestral chromosomes 12 and 16, and 11 and 18, respectively.
Though this strategy could not assign all prairie vole
chromosomes to an ancestral Microtus chromosome, or
vice versa, it does suggest that at the macro-level the
prairie vole genome differs from the ancestral Microtus
karyotype by the aforementioned pair of fission events,
and presumably at least two fusion events which would
be needed to maintain the diploid karyotype of 2n = 54
present in both the prairie vole and ancestral state.
However, it is important to note that future improvement of the vole linkage map may alter some of the
comparisons we report here. Future comparative mapping studies of other Microtus genomes that can now be
undertaken by leveraging the genomic resources being
developed for the prairie vole will provide further
insights into the rates and mechanisms by which genomes within this genus have evolved.

Conclusions
The genetic linkage map of the prairie vole will provide an
important resource towards our understanding of genome
evolution in the genus Microtus. Further, it will provide a
beneficial resource for furthering our understanding of the
genetic basis of social behaviors and other traits while giving insight into how these traits evolve.

232 library [19], or using data from an ongoing unpublished transcriptome sequencing project (see GenBank
SRA Accessions: SRX018685, SRX018510, SRX018516,
SRX018515, SRX018511, SRX018514, SRX018513,
SRX018512). In the case of the BAC-end re-sequencing,
loci-specific M13F and M13R tailed primers were designed
with PRIMER3 [42] and used to PCR amplify and then
directly sequence (Sanger) each locus in three individuals
from our local colony of prairie voles. Variant calls from
PolyPhred [43] were manually validated and a prioritized
list of SNPs was selected for genotyping. In particular,
SNPs linked to loci that shared homology with the mouse
genome were preferentially selected for genotyping using
the SNPStream® (Beckman Coulter) platform. Transcriptome sequencing data generated with the Roche 454
sequencing platform [44] was scanned for SNPs by mapping the individual reads back to the contigs in which they
were assembled by Newbler (Roche) using the GS Reference Mapper algorithm (Roche). The candidate SNPs were
then filtered to select only those with > 30% (minimum of
3) reads supporting the alternative allele and were > 60-bp
from the nearest flanking variable site, repetitive sequence
(RepeatMasker, http://repeatmasker.org/), or predicted
intron-exon boundary defined based on alignment of the
prairie vole transcripts to the mouse genome.
The chromosome locations for the mouse orthologs of
the 2773 prairie vole transcripts in which at least one
SNP was identified were used as a proxy to select a uniformly-spaced and genome-wide set of 384 SNPs for
genotyping on the GoldenGate (Illumina) platform. The
names, sequences, and other accessory information for
each genotyped locus are described in Additional File 1.
Pedigree structure

A total of 353 prairie voles from our local colony were
genotyped. After excluding individuals with questionable
parentage, i.e. children for which genotypes at > 3% of
the makers were inconsistent with the parental genotypes, two pedigrees were selected for constructing the
linkage map: a 3-4 generation pedigree derived from
interbreeding descendents of three founder breeding
pairs (n = 263 individuals, Additional File 3), and a single nuclear family (n = 22 individuals, Additional File 4).
Euthanasia and collection of liver samples for DNA
extractions were performed as per guidelines that were
reviewed and approved by the Emory Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in
accordance with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Research
Council.

rates or indicated the presence of a paralogous sequence
variant, i.e., all heterozygous genotypes (n = 47), were
monomorphic (n = 109), or associated with an inferred
genotype error rate in excess of 7% (n = 37) were excluded
from the linkage analyses. Inconsistent genotypes, which
represented 0.5% (n = 638) of the genotype calls for the
remaining 438 markers, were re-coded as no data. The
final data set used for the linkage analyses included
122,071 genotype calls and 2,759 missing data points.
Linkage map construction

A modified version of CRI-MAP [45], v2.503 (kindly
provided by J. F. Maddox), was used to estimate twopoint LOD scores between all markers. The markers
were then placed into linkage groups based on a LOD
threshold of ≥ 2.5, but note that only 5 markers in the
final linkage groups had a maximum two-point LOD
score of < 3.0. When necessary, the initial linkage
groups were further subdivided by increasing the LOD
threshold in order to yield groups of markers that limited the number of potentially spurious linkages, i.e.,
those that were at odds with the published comparative
cytogenetic map [19]. The order of markers within an
individual linkage group was determined by establishing
a framework map with the BUILD option and then adding and iteratively re-ordering markers with the FLIPS3/
4 option until no order with a better likelihood score
could be found. Due to the size of the first pedigree this
procedure proved to be computationally impractical for
prairie vole chromosomes 1, 2, 4 and 16, and linkage
groups 1, 3 and 4. To overcome this problem we split
the large pedigree into smaller overlapping sub-families,
optimized the marker order as above, and when possible
then calculated the likelihood map scores and cM positions for the best map using the original pedigree
structure.
An inherent methodological limitation of the likelihood-based method used by CRI-MAP is that it does
not necessarily explore all possible marker orders, and
thus the marker order found to have the best likelihood
score starting from a given framework map may not
represent the true optimal order of the markers. To
address that limitation, when the linkage groups
included more than 2 loci that mapped to the same
orthologous mouse chromosome and the order of the
markers was not the same as that in mouse we also calculated the likelihood score of each group of markers
assuming an order equivalent to that of the mouse. For
prairie vole chromsomes 6, 10, 15 and 21, the marker
order predicted by the orthologous positions in the
mouse yielded a map with a better likelihood score than
the synteny naïve method, in which case the mouse
order was used as starting point to improve the ordering
of the prairie vole markers with the FLIPS option.

Additionally, several markers were uniquely placed to
the same position on the map Pair-wise LOD scores for
these loci are indicated in Additional File 5. The linkage
maps were plotted using MapChart2.2 [46].
Integration of linkage and cytogenetic maps

The prairie vole-mouse comparative cytogenetic map
described in [19] was integrated with the linkage mapping data based on the orthologous position of the markers in the mouse genome. Specifically, the orthologous
mouse positions of the FISH mapped BAC clones in
[19] were converted from mm8 to mm9 coordinates.
Both the cytogenetic and linkage markers were then
sorted based on their position/order along the prairie
vole chromosomes and orthologous position in the
mouse genome (Additional File 2).
Comparative analyses

Loci in the prairie vole linkage map with a known orthologous position in the mouse genome (Additional File 1)
were used to construct a comparative map with the
mouse (genome assembly version mm9). The corresponding orthologous position and orientation in the
human (genome assembly version hg19) and rat genomes
(genome assembly version rn4) of those loci was also
inferred using the UCSC Genome Browser LiftOver tool
http://genome.ucsc.edu/hgLiftOver. GRIMM [22] was
used to infer the orientation of the loci in prairie vole
linkage map via a comparison to the mouse genome.
MGR [23] was then applied to the four-way comparison
between the marker order in prairie vole linkage map
and the mouse, rat and human genomes to estimate the
number and types of rearrangements that had occurred
across the phylogeny. Note that the relative order of
prairie vole markers that mapped to the identical location
in the linkage map were assigned randomly, or when
applicable by maximizing conserved synteny with the
mouse (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). A conserved
block of synteny was defined as 2 or more consecutive
markers (ignoring markers without a known orthologous
position in the mouse genome) that were present as
uninterrupted strings of loci, independent of order, in the
prairie vole linkage map and mouse genome. The size of
a conserved syntenic block was defined as the distance
between the first and last loci within the block based on
the mouse chromosomal position and order.
