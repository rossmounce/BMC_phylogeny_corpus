Abstract
Background: We investigated the possibility of executing DNA-based computation in living cells by
engineering Escherichia coli to address a classic mathematical puzzle called the Burnt Pancake Problem
(BPP). The BPP is solved by sorting a stack of distinct objects (pancakes) into proper order and orientation
using the minimum number of manipulations. Each manipulation reverses the order and orientation of one
or more adjacent objects in the stack. We have designed a system that uses site-specific DNA
recombination to mediate inversions of genetic elements that represent pancakes within plasmid DNA.
Results: Inversions (or "flips") of the DNA fragment pancakes are driven by the Salmonella typhimurium
Hin/hix DNA recombinase system that we reconstituted as a collection of modular genetic elements for
use in E. coli. Our system sorts DNA segments by inversions to produce different permutations of a
promoter and a tetracycline resistance coding region; E. coli cells become antibiotic resistant when the
segments are properly sorted. Hin recombinase can mediate all possible inversion operations on adjacent
flippable DNA fragments. Mathematical modeling predicts that the system reaches equilibrium after very
few flips, where equal numbers of permutations are randomly sorted and unsorted. Semiquantitative PCR
analysis of in vivo flipping suggests that inversion products accumulate on a time scale of hours or days
rather than minutes.
Conclusion: The Hin/hix system is a proof-of-concept demonstration of in vivo computation with the
potential to be scaled up to accommodate larger and more challenging problems. Hin/hix may provide a
flexible new tool for manipulating transgenic DNA in vivo.

Background
The tremendous information storage capacity of DNA and
the remarkable efficiency of biomolecular self-assembly
have inspired researchers to design biological computers.
Previous work has created proof-of-concept biological
computers based on in vitro self-assembly of DNA [1] and
protein-DNA interactions [2-4]. Thus far, biological computing is limited to nonliving devices that have not utilized the parallel processing power afforded by DNA
replication and cellular division. In order to demonstrate
the feasibility of in vivo computing, we programmed
Escherichia coli to address a classic mathematical challenge
called the Burnt Pancake Problem (BPP) [5]. The BPP can
be visualized as a stack of different sized pancakes, each
having one burnt side and one golden side, arranged in an
arbitrary order. The stack must be sorted by flipping individual pancakes or subsets of adjacent pancakes until the

http://www.jbioleng.org/content/2/1/8

pancakes are ordered from smallest to largest with each
pancake oriented golden side up (see example in Fig. 1).
The BPP is also known as sorting by reversals since both
the order and orientation of the pancakes are changed
when they are flipped. The BPP is a subject of interest in
basic mathematical and computational research (e.g.,
[5]). Of particular interest to biologists is the application
of the BPP to comparative genomics. The evolutionary
distance between syntenic genomes of two organisms is
determined by the minimum number of reversals
required to sort regions of genes in one organism to match
the order and orientation of orthologous genes in the
other organism [6-8]. The total number of possible
arrangements of n objects (i.e., pancakes or genes) is
2n(n!), an exponential increase in arrangements as the
stack of objects (pancakes or genes) becomes larger. Plasmid DNA replication and exponential cell growth in bac-

The Burnt Pancake Problem can be modeled using genetic elements. (A) Sorting of a scrambled two-pancake stack
(rectangles) where the smaller burnt pancake (1, blue) and the larger burnt pancake (2, purple) are in the wrong order (2, 1).
First, the whole stack is flipped and both pancakes are turned burnt side up (hatched shading). The next two flips turn the small
then the large pancake golden side up (solid shading) resulting in a properly sorted stack (1, 2). Analogous DNA segment
arrangements are shown below. Sorting of the promoter (1, blue arrow) and coding region (2, purple arrow) into (1, 2) is
required for gene expression. (B) The process of sorting scrambled pancake stack (2, 1) into the solution (1, 2) is plotted on a
graph. The eight possible arrangements of the pancake stack are shown as signed permutations at the vertices. (2, 1) is converted into the three neighboring permutations by a flip of a single pancake (arrow) or both pancakes simultaneously (double
headed arrow). Six distinct paths of length 3 can convert (2, 1) into (1, 2). The flipping pathway highlighted in red corresponds
to the flips shown in part A

teria are inexpensive, occupy much less space than
computer hardware, and maintain parity with the exponential increase in BPP arrangements. Therefore, solving
the BPP in living cells offers unique advantages over using
computer hardware.
The biological equivalent of a burnt pancake is a functional module of DNA such as a promoter or coding
region (Fig. 1a). Similar to burnt pancakes in the BPP,
DNA modules have directionality (5' to 3'), require a specific order of the units (e.g., promoter followed by coding
region) and can be flipped (cut, inverted, and spliced in
vivo by cellular machinery). We designed a modular system in which pancake stacks are assembled from flippable
DNA segments. Flipping of the DNA segment "pancakes"
is mediated by a Salmonella typhimurium-derived DNA
recombination system. In Salmonella, Hin DNA recombinase catalyzes an inversion reaction that regulates the
expression of alternative flagellin genes by switching the
orientation of a promoter located on a 1 kb invertible
DNA segment [9,10]. Two palindromic 26 bp hix
sequences flank the invertible DNA segment and serve as
the recognition sites for cleavage and strand exchange. A
~70 bp cis-acting recombinational enhancer (RE) increases
efficiency of protein-DNA complex formation [11]. We
have reconstituted the genetic elements required for DNA
inversion as a collection of modular genetic elements for
use in E. coli. Our system is a proof-of-concept genetic
computing device that manipulates plasmid DNA processors within living cells.

Results and discussion
Design and construction of a Hin/hix-based DNA
recombination system
DNA inversion occurs very rapidly in vitro. Protein-DNA
complex assembly, strand cleavage, inversion, and ligation occur in less than 1 minute [11]. Therefore, we engineered Hin/hix inversion to be more tractable to
regulation and kinetic studies by decreasing inversion efficiency. Hin was cloned from S. typhimurium by PCR. An
ssrA LVA protein degradation tag [12] was added to the Cterminal DNA binding domain to prevent over accumulation of Hin and to achieve tighter control of DNA inversion. In Salmonella, the asymmetrical palindromic
sequences hixL and hixR flank the invertible DNA segment
and serve as the recognition sites for cleavage and strand
exchange. Our system uses hixC, a composite symmetrical
hix site that shows higher binding affinity for Hin and a
16-fold slower inversion rate than wild type sites hixL and
hixR [13,14].

To build a proof-of-concept model, we designed a twopancake BPP containing the Lac promoter (pLac) and a tetracycline resistance coding region with a ribosomal binding site upstream (RBS-tetA(C)), each flanked by hixC sites

http://www.jbioleng.org/content/2/1/8

(Fig. 2). Each configuration of this two-pancake stack is
represented by a mathematical signed permutation. For
instance, hixC-RBS-tetA(C)-hixC-pLacrev-hixC is represented as the signed permutation "(2, -1)" where RBStetA(C) is 2 and pLac is 1. The positive value (2) represents
the forward orientation of RBS-tetA(C) and the negative
value (-1) represents the reverse orientation of pLac,
denoted pLacrev (pLac reversed). The eight possible signed
permutations can be plotted as vertices of a graph (Fig.
1b). Two signed permutations are connected by an edge if
it is possible to convert one permutation to the other with
a flip of one or two pancakes. When flipping occurs at random, the starting permutation can be converted into any
of its three neighboring permutations. In cells, after a
given amount of time (i.e., number of flips), flipping is
stopped by manual cell lysis, BPP plasmids are purified
and transformed into new cells lacking HinLVA, and
solved BPP plasmids are detected by resistance to tetracycline (pLac driven RBS-tetA(C) expression) in each colony.
The time point at which the BPP is first solved at random
reflects the minimal number of flips required to solve the
BPP.
HinLVA flips and sorts hixC-flanked DNA segments in vivo
In order to solve the BPP, HinLVA must be able to flip single pancakes of varying sizes, flip adjacent segments independently, and sort segments by flipping multiple
pancakes simultaneously. First, we tested HinLVA-mediated inversion on single hixC-flanked DNA segments of
different lengths. HinLVA successfully flips the 1212 bp
RBS-tetA(C) segment (Fig. 3a). The length of RBS-tetA(C)
is comparable to the segment that is inverted by Hin
recombinase in Salmonella [9,10]. HinLVA can also flip
the much shorter 200 bp hixC-flanked promoter (Fig. 3b).
Restriction digest fragments indicate approximately equal
molar amounts of both conformations (forward and
reverse), suggesting that flipping of one DNA pancake has
reached equilibrium ~24 hours after transformation.
These data indicate that HinLVA-mediated inversion
reconstituted in E. coli is not limited by fragment size, at
least not within the range of 200 – 1212 bp.

Next, we cotransformed cells with a BPP plasmid containing a hixC-flanked RBS-tetA(C)rev coding region and a
hixC-flanked pLac promoter (permutation (-2, 1)) and a
HinLVA expression plasmid (Fig. 2). The RE was omitted
from the BPP plasmid to slow the rate of inversion. We
used multiplex semiquantitative PCR (sqPCR) to monitor
flipping of the two adjacent hixC-flanked DNA segments.
Each of the four internal rearrangements can be detected
by a sqPCR amplicon of a distinct size (Fig. 4a). Eleven
hours after transformation, single colonies were picked
for whole cell sqPCR. Bands from all four configurations
were visible in samples where (-2, 1) was cotransformed
with HinLVA (Fig. 4b). Flipping occurred in the absence

RBS-tetA(C) (green rectangle = RBS, purple arrow = tetA(C)). The pLac promoter is pancake 1 and RBS-tetA(C) is pancake 2. hixC
sites (yellow rectangles) flank each flippable element. Inversion of pLac is detected by expression of the reverse (rev) upstream
RBS-mRFP reporter. HinLVA is expressed from a second plasmid (right). AmpR = ampicillin resistance marker, ChlrR = chloramphenicol resistance marker, repA pSC101 and ColE1 = origins of replication, RBS = ribosome binding site, TT = double

of the RE, demonstrating that HinLVA and a pair of hixC
sites are sufficient for a functional Hin/hix DNA inversion
system in E. coli. The starting pancake arrangement (-2, 1)
is the predominant plasmid in all colonies tested. Plasmids generated from a single flip of either RBS-tetA(C)
(pancake 2) or pLac (pancake 1) are the next most frequent, while plasmids generated from two sequential flips
of both pancakes 2 and 1 are the least common. We could
not detect significant bias for flipping of the larger RBStetA(C) segment or the smaller pLac promoter (Fig. 4c),
suggesting that flipping is not influenced by the size of the
DNA segment.
The sqPCR results suggest that flipping has not yet reached
equilibrium after 11 hours of HinLVA activity in the
absence of RE. Plasmid supercoiling might be a limiting
factor. Hin-mediated inversion requires a negatively
supercoiled plasmid DNA substrate [15,16]. The loss of

four negative supercoils after each inversion event [17]
might require cells to undergo cell division to reset optimal supercoiling before a second inversion event can
occur. Based on the 4 hour lag time and 36 minute maximum doubling rate of the cotransformed cells, we estimate that no more than 12 doublings occurred before
sqPCR analysis. Twelve cell divisions appear to be insufficient to allow the distribution of rearrangements to reach
equilibrium.
Finally, we assessed simultaneous inversion of both DNA
pancakes. In order to accomplish this operation, Hin must
recognize the outer-most hixC sites and ignore the central
hixC site between the segments. Inversion of the entire
permutation (-2, 1) generates permutation (-1, 2) in
which the pLac promoter is repositioned to drive mRFP
reporter expression (Fig. 5a). Inversion of the promoter
alone, producing (-2, -1), is insufficient to induce detect-

HinLVA mediates inversions of short and long DNA fragments. HinLVA-mediated flipping was assessed by NheI
restriction digests. Gel electrophoresis images are shown in A and B. (A) A construct carrying hixC-flanked RBS-tetA(C) in the
forward orientation (solid purple arrow) is characterized by a ~200 bp NheI restriction fragment (gel lane 2). The reverse orientation of RBS-tetA(C) (hatched purple arrow) yields a larger ~1100 bp band (lane 3). When forward oriented hixC-flanked
RBS-tetA(C) is exposed to HinLVA, bands for both forward and reverse orientations of RBS-tetA(C) are detected (lane 4). (B)
Similarly, forward oriented hixC-flanked pBAD promoter (solid green arrow) is converted to the reverse orientation (hatched
green arrow) after exposure to HinLVA (lane 4). These data show that HinLVA-mediated inversion activity is not constrained
by the length of hixC-flanked DNA.

able levels of mRFP (Table 1). Colonies containing HinLVA and the (-2, 1) BPP plasmid were grown as a liquid
culture then the Hin-exposed BPP plasmids were isolated
and transformed into bacteria. About one third of the cell
colonies appeared red (Fig. 5b) indicating that simultaneous inversion of both DNA segments occurred at a high
frequency. Thus, HinLVA is capable of mediating the
inversion of at least two adjacent flippable DNA segments.

Modeling and detection of phenotypic output
We sought to use the power and sensitivity of antibiotic
resistance phenotype screening to detect solved BPP plasmids. sqPCR analyzes one colony at a time and requires
several plasmids to generate a detectable PCR amplicon,
whereas screening can rapidly distinguish a single solved
BPP plasmid from millions of unsolved plasmids in a cell
culture. Permutations (1, 2) and (-2, -1) both encode a
functional tetracycline resistance gene that should allow
cells to live in the presence of tetracycline. The other six
permutations encode a disrupted tetracycline resistance

Mathematical model of random flipping
Mathematical model of random flipping. Flipping was modeled as a Markov Chain in which each of the possible eight
starting permutations is a state (shown in parenthesis in the graph). At each step (Number of flips (k)) in a random walk on the
graph in Figure 1b, the probability of a plasmid being properly sorted (% Plasmids that solved the problem) after k flips is calculated as the number of paths of length k from the initial state to the solution state, divided by the total number of paths of
length k from the initial state to any state. Starting permutations that show equivalent behavior can be grouped into three families (distinguished by color in the graph). The families are distinguishable for up to 4 flips; at 5 flips and beyond they reach a
state of equilibrium at 25% plasmids solved.

gene and should lead to cell death in the presence of tetracycline. Based on these predicted phenotypic outputs,
we designed a mathematical model of random flipping
over time (successive flips) to predict how cell survival
(the percentage of solved pancake stacks) might change
over time. We modeled flipping as a Markov Chain in
which each of the possible eight signed permutations is a
state. Our model is synonymous with a random walk on
the graph in Figure 1b. We assumed that any segment of
DNA flanked by two hixC sites (pancake 1, pancake 2, or
both) is equally likely to be flipped by HinLVA and that
all flips in the population of cells happen synchronously.
According to this model, the probability of a plasmid
being properly sorted after k flips is determined by the
number of paths of length k from the initial state to the
solution state, divided by the total number of paths of
length k from the initial state to any state. For instance,
there are six paths of length 3 from initial state (2, 1) to
solution state (1, 2) (Fig. 1b); because there are 27 possible paths of length 3 that start at (2, 1), the probability of
being in a solution state after three flips is 6/27 (22%). We
observed two interesting features of the output from a
simulation of random flipping (Fig. 6). First, the conversion of unsolved BPP plasmids towards and away from
the solution state reaches equilibrium at 25% survival
after five flips. Second, several starting arrangements show
equivalent behavior as they approach equilibrium (i.e.,
(1, -2) and (-1, 2)). The simulation output has implications for further design of our system. If our model is correct, only one representative from each class of equivalent
starting configurations needs to be tested. Furthermore, if
equilibrium (25% survival) is reached after only five flips,
slowing Hin-mediated inversion by omitting the RE may
be required to detect significant changes in cell survival
over time.
As an initial step towards carrying out flipping in vivo, we
manually constructed all eight pancake permutations
(excluding the RE) and transformed them into cells to
confirm their phenotypes. We observed several unexpected outcomes. In cells that contain a strong pLac
repressor (lacIQ), BPP plasmids (1, 2) and (-2, -1) showed
significant tetracycline resistance without activation of
pLac by IPTG. We also observed that HinLVA-mediated
inversion does not require induction of the pLac promoter
on the HinLVA plasmid, indicating general leakiness of
pLac promoter activity probably due to more lacIQ binding
sites than available repressor protein [18]. The addition of
IPTG appears to slow the growth of (1, 2) transformants;
this might be result of toxic TetA(C) over expression [19].
We expected to detect mRFP expression from all four plasmids that contain reversed pLac. However, reversed pLac
fails to induce mRFP expression when it is positioned after
tetA(C) (i.e., RBS-mRFP-hixC-RBS-tetA(C)-hixC-pLacrev-

http://www.jbioleng.org/content/2/1/8

hixC). Increased distance from mRFP or the DNA structure
of tetA(C) [20,21] might block transcription of mRFP.
We found it surprising that four constructs in which pLac
is not in the proper position and/or orientation to drive
expression of tetA(C) were able to confer tetracycline
resistance; in the presence of IPTG, three of these showed
more robust growth than cells carrying (1, 2). When the
pLac promoter was removed from the construct, cells were
still tetracycline resistant (data not shown), thus pLac is
not required for expression in the pBR322-derived cloning vector we had been using (pSB4A3). Read-through
transcription by RNA polymerase binding to the antibiotic resistance marker promoter or degenerate promoter
sequences within the vector backbone [22] could result in
tetA(C) expression in the tetracycline resistant scrambled
permutations (1, -2), (-1, 2), (-2, 1), and (2, 1). We constructed an "insulated" vector (pSB1A7) containing forward and reverse double transcription terminator
sequences to shield RBS-tetA(C) from read-through transcription. In pSB1A7, there was no expression of RBStetA(C) (forward or reverse) when pLac was removed from
the construct. Arrangements (1, 2) and (-2, -1) produced
tetracycline resistance, as expected. Surprisingly, we also
observed tetracycline resistance in the insulated vector
when pLac was reversed relative to tetA(C) in arrangements (-1, 2) and (-2, 1), suggesting reverse promoter
activity from pLac. Unlike forward transcription initiated
from pLac, backwards transcription did not respond to
IPTG as determined by cell growth; IPTG induction of forward transcription from pLac led to overexpression of
tetA(C) and subsequent cell death [19]. Due to the backwards promoter activity of pLac, our manually built set of
permutations are not distinguishable by phenotype, thus
phenotype alone is insufficient to perform computation
using pLac and RBS-tetA(C). The observations described
above demonstrate that the construction of synthetic biological devices can reveal unexpected characteristics of
well-studied DNA elements (e.g., pLac).

Conclusion
We have demonstrated that a modified Hin/hix DNA
recombination system can be used in vivo to manipulate
at least two adjacent hixC-flanked DNA segments; HinLVA
and hixC are sufficient for DNA inversion activity. The RE
is not required, although it may play some role in preventing aberrant flips that lead to plasmid knotting [23] and
subsequent plasmid loss [24]. Thus, the RE might be
added to BPP plasmids to increase DNA recombination
efficiency. Once phenotypic output is optimized for this
system, the kinetics of flipping (i.e., number of flips per
unit of time) could be determined by comparing Markov
Chain model simulation output to in vivo pancake sorting.
Comparing actual cell survival to the survival probabilities predicted by our model should also enable us to deter-

mine whether flipping is biased for different sized DNA
fragments.
The Hin/hix DNA recombination system could be used for
other biological engineering applications. We have developed a set of modular genetic elements (hixC, RE, and
HinLVA) that expands the repertoire of molecular tools
for enzyme-mediated DNA manipulation in vivo. As with
Cre/loxP from P1 bacteriophage [25] and Flp/FRT from
yeast [26], Hin/hix may open avenues for recombinasemediated transgene engineering. For instance, hixCflanked promoters and other regulatory elements could
function as flippable genetic toggle switches to regulate
gene expression just as Hin mediates the expression of
flagellin genes in Salmonella. Manipulation of genetic elements within a transgene at a single insertion site eliminates the problem of genomic position effects associated
with independently introducing variants of transgenes at
different loci. Furthermore, adjacent genetic elements
could be rearranged at a single locus (e.g., switching the
positions of a promoter and transcriptional insulator to
test how well the insulator blocks transcription). The ability of Hin recombinase to invert large and small DNA fragments and adjacent flippable elements demonstrates the
potential flexibility of the Hin/hix system.
The capability of HinLVA to flip adjacent DNA segments
indicates that this system could be scaled up to accommodate more complex pancake stacks. As an application in
comparative genomics, flippable DNA segment arrays
could serve as a model to improve our understanding of
syntenic genome rearrangements that have occurred during evolution. Chromosomal regions exist as syntenic
modules arranged in different orders and orientations in
the genomes of related species. Each syntenic module can
be considered a burnt pancake that has a particular order
and orientation. Phylogenetic relationships between species can be inferred by using BPP mathematical modeling
to compute the minimum number of rearrangements that
link two syntenic genomes (see [27] for review). Hinmediated rearrangements of an array containing different
sized DNA fragments would help refine the mathematical
model by accounting for the impact of differences in
sequence composition and lengths of syntenic modules.
Using Hin/hix to sort DNA fragment permutations in vivo
expands the horizons for the emerging field of applied
DNA-based computing.

Methods
Construction of parts and plasmids
All genetic elements reported here are standardized parts
(prefixed "BBa_" and "pSB") that are flanked by universal
"BioBrick" cloning sites [28] and are documented and distributed by the MIT Registry of Standard Biological Parts
[29].E. coli strain JM109 was used for cloning and as the

http://www.jbioleng.org/content/2/1/8

chassis for our system. The recombinational enhancer (RE,
BBa_J3101) [30], hixC (BBa_J44000) [13], RBSrev
(BBa_J44001) and pBADrev (BBa_J44002) were assembled
from 20 – 60 bp DNA oligomers that were designed using
the "Oligo Cuts Optimization Program" [31]. EcoRI (5')
and PstI (3') single stranded extensions were manually
added to the terminal oligomers. An equimolar mix of
single-stranded oligomers in 1× annealing buffer [100
mM NaCl; 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4] was incubated at
100°C for 5 minutes, then slowly cooled to ambient temperature in a water bath to produce double stranded DNA
with EcoRI (5') and PstI (3') single stranded overhangs.
The annealed DNA was ligated into linearized (EcoRI and
PstI digested) cloning vector pSB1A2 using T4 ligase
(Promega). Hin (BBa_J31000), HinLVA (BBa_J31001),
and tetA(C) (BBa_J31007), and were cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Standard BioBrick prefix cloning sites (EcoRI, NotI and XbaI) or suffix cloning sites (SpeI,
NotI and PstI) were included in the forward or reverse PCR
primer, respectively. PCR amplicons were digested with
EcoRI and PstI, electrophoresed in an agarose gel, purified, and ligated into a linearized cloning vector. Hin
[GenBank: see Availability and requirements section for
URL] was cloned from Salmonella typhimurium Ames strain
TA100 genomic DNA using forward primer 5'GCATGAATTCGCGGCCGCTCTAGATGGCTACTATTGGGTATATTC and reverse primer 5'-ATGCCTGCAGGCGGCC
GCAACTAGTTAATTCATTCGTTTTTTTATAC. HinLVA was
generated by PCR amplification of Hin (BBa_J31000)
using forward primer 5'-TCTGGAATTCGCGGCCGCATC
TAGAGATG
and
reverse
primer
5'CTGCAGGCGGCCGCTACTAGTATTAAGCTACTAAAGC
GTAGTTTTCGTCGTTTGCAGCATTCATTCGTTTTTTTATAC containing a ssrA LVA degradation tag (based on
gfp(down, LVA) [12]).tetA(C) was cloned from vector
pSB1AT3 using forward primer 5'-GCATTCTAGATGAAATCTAACAATGCGCTCATC and reverse primer 5'ATGCACTAGTTAGG
TCGAGGTGGCCCGGC; the amplicon was cloned using a
XbaI/SpeI digest. Reversed parts were generated by PCR
amplification of MIT Registry parts using a forward primer
containing SpeI and a reverse primer containing XbaI:
tetA(C)rev (BBa_J31006) – forward 5'-ATGCACTAGTATGAAATCTAACAATGCGCTCATC and reverse 5'-GCATTCT
AGATTAGGTCGAGGTGGCCCGGC; pLacrev (BBa_J31
013) – forward 5'-ATGCACTAGTACAATACGCAAACCGC
CTCTC and reverse 5'-GCATTCTAGAGTGTGTGAAATTGTTATCCGC; mRFPrev (BBa_J31008) – forward 5'ATGCACTAGTATGGCTTCCTCCGAAGACGT and reverse
5'-GCATTCTAGATTAAGCACCGGTGGAGTGAC. Correct
sizes and sequences of the genetic elements described
above were confirmed by XbaI/SpeI double digestion and
DNA sequencing. The constructs shown in Figure 2, the
eight two-pancake BPP plasmids (Table 1), and the Hin-

LVA expression vector were assembled using the standard
BioBrick assembly method [27]. Proper assembly of construction intermediates was confirmed by EcoRI/PstI double digestion. Fully assembled two-pancake BPP
constructs (1, 2) (BBa_S03684), (-2, -1) (BBa_S03681),
(1, -2) (BBa_S03685), (-2, 1) (BBa_S03679), (-1, 2)
(BBa_S03687), (-2, 1) (BBa_S03680), (2, 1)
(BBa_S03677), and (-1, -2) (BBa_S03688) were confirmed by sequencing. BPP constructs were inserted into
low copy pSC101 vector pSB4A3 (Fig. 2) and subsequently tested in insulated high copy pMB1 vector
pSB1A7. pLac-RBS-HinLVA-TT (BBa_S03536) was
inserted into low copy ColE1 vector BBa_J64100 (from
Jeffrey J. Tabor) to create the HinLVA plasmid (Fig. 2). The
cloning vectors are described in [29].
Hin-mediated DNA recombination
Growth of transformed colonies on LB agar and in shaking liquid cultures took place overnight at 37°C. For single DNA segment flipping assays (Fig. 3), constructs
containing the HinLVA gene on the same vector as the
invertible segment (BBa_J44006 – pLac-RBS-HinLVA-TThixC-pBAD-hixC-RBS-tetA(C)-TT-RE or pLac-RBS-HinLVATT-pBAD-hixC-RBS-tetA(C)-hixC-TT-RE in vector pSB1A2)
were transformed into JM109 chemically competent cells.
After growth on selective media (LB agar plus 100 μg/mL
ampicillin), single colonies were grown in liquid selective
media (LB plus 100 μg/mL ampicillin) overnight. For the
two-pancake stack flipping assay, 10 ng each of a plasmid
containing a two-pancake stack (Table 1) and the HinLVA
expression plasmid were combined in 5 μL sterile distilled
H2O and co-transformed into Z-competent JM109 chemically competent cells according to the manufacturer's
protocol (Zymo Research). Cells were grown at 37°C on
LB agar selective media (20 μg/mL ampicillin, 50 μg/mL
chlroamphenicol).
Detection of DNA inversions
Inversions of single hixC-flanked DNA segments were
detected by restriction digests (Fig. 3). Plasmid DNA was
purified from each culture (Promega Wizard and Zymo
Zyppy miniprep systems), digested with NheI, and
resolved by agarose (Fig. 3a) or polyacrylamide (Fig. 3b)
gel electrophoresis. Inversions of adjacent hixC-flanked
segments were detected by multiplex semiquantitative
PCR (sqPCR) (Fig. 4). 11 hours following transformation,
46 visible co-transformant colonies were picked from LB
agar selective media and subjected to whole cell multiplex
sqPCR (95°C, 10 min.; 95°C, 30 sec., 60°C, 30 sec., and
72°C, 15 sec. for 26 cycles). Each colony was suspended
in 60 μL 1× PCR mix (Promega Green master mix plus 0.7
μM primers pLacR 5'-GAATCGGCCAACGCGCGGGG,
pLacF 5'-GTTTCCCGACTGGAAAGCGG, TetR 5'-GTAGAGGATCCACAGGACGG and TetF 5'-TCGTAGGACAGGTGCCGGCA). 0.1 pmol of an equimolar mix of all 8

http://www.jbioleng.org/content/2/1/8

two-pancake BPP plasmids or 0.1 pmol of the (-2, 1) BPP
plasmid alone was used as the template in a control PCR
reaction. During PCR, an 11 μL aliquot was collected from
each reaction after cycles 18, 20, 22, 24 and 26. Samples
were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel and photographed under ultraviolet light using a BioRad imager.
Band intensities were quantified using BioRad Quantity
One imaging software. The detectable band threshold was
set at 10,000 (after background subtraction).
To detect simultaneous flipping of two DNA segments
(described in Fig. 5) single co-transformed colonies were
picked from agar plates and grown in selective liquid
media (20 μg/mL ampicillin, 50 μg/mL chlroamphenicol). To eliminate the Hin plasmid after flipping, plasmid
DNA was purified from the liquid cultures and transformed into new competent cells. Cells were grown on LB
agar containing 20 μg/mL ampicillin to select for transformants that contained a recombined BPP plasmid, and
40 μg/mL IPTG to induce pLac-driven expression of mRFP.
mRFP expression was detected under ultraviolet light and
photographed using a BioRad imager.
