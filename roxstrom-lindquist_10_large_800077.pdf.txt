Abstract
Background: Microbial eukaryotes show large variations in genome structure and content between lineages,
indicating extensive flexibility over evolutionary timescales. Here we address the tempo and mode of such changes
within diplomonads, flagellated protists with two nuclei found in oxygen-poor environments. Approximately 5,000
expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences were generated from the fish commensal Spironucleus barkhanus and
compared to sequences from the morphologically indistinguishable fish parasite Spironucleus salmonicida, and other
diplomonads. The ESTs were complemented with sequence variation studies in selected genes and genome size
determinations.
Results: Many genes detected in S. barkhanus and S. salmonicida are absent in the human parasite Giardia intestinalis,
the most intensively studied diplomonad. For example, these fish diplomonads show an extended metabolic
repertoire and are able to incorporate selenocysteine into proteins. The codon usage is altered in S. barkhanus
compared to S. salmonicida. Sequence variations were found between individual S. barkhanus ESTs for many, but not
all, protein coding genes. Conversely, no allelic variation was found in a previous genome survey of S. salmonicida. This
difference was confirmed by sequencing of genomic DNA. Up to five alleles were identified for the cloned S. barkhanus
genes, and at least nineteen highly expressed S. barkhanus genes are represented by more than four alleles in the EST
dataset. This could be explained by the presence of a non-clonal S. barkhanus population in the culture, by a ploidy
above four, or by duplications of parts of the genome. Indeed, genome size estimations using flow cytometry indicated
similar haploid genome sizes in S. salmonicida and G. intestinalis (~12 Mb), whereas the S. barkhanus genome is larger
(~18 Mb).
Conclusions: This study indicates extensive divergent genome evolution within diplomonads. Genomic traits such as
codon usage, frequency of allelic sequence variation, and genome size have changed considerably between S.
barkhanus and S. salmonicida. These observations suggest that large genomic differences may accumulate in
morphologically indistinguishable eukaryotic microbes.
Background
Eukaryotic genomes are very diverse in size, content,
structure and mode of inheritance. The size of haploid
genomes varies extensively. Some microsporidia have
genomes of a few mega base pairs (Mb), whereas amoeba,

plants and animal genomes can be thousands of Mb [1].
There are also large differences in genome organization
within and between eukaryotic groups [1]. The frequency
and occurrence of meiotic sex also varies extensively
between eukaryotic lineages, even if it is problematic to
determine whether a specific lineage undergoes meiosis
or other kinds of genetic recombination [2]. Very little is
known about the variation of these various traits within

and between different eukaryotic groups except for a
selection of extensively studied fungi, plants and animals.
We are currently performing a comparative genomics
project on representatives from the microbial eukaryotic
group Diplomonadida (diplomonads), with the overall
aim to deepening the understanding of the factors that
shape eukaryotic genomes in general, and diplomonad
genomes in particular.
Diplomonads are a group of anaerobic, or micro-aerophilic, flagellated protists classified within Excavata [3].
All members of the group, with the exception of the
monokaryotic enteromonads, have double sets of nuclei,
flagella and other organelles [4]. Diplomonads are frequently found in environments depleted with oxygen, and
the group contains pathogens, commensals and free-living species [5]. The intestinal parasite Giardia intestinalis
(syn. G. lamblia and G. duodenalis), a major cause of
waterborne enteric disease in humans, is the most studied diplomonad [6-8]. There are currently seven different
genotypes (A-G) identified within the G. intestinalis species complex; human infections are caused by genotypes
A and B [6]. However, it has been suggested that the morphological species G. intestinalis should possibly be
divided into several species based on host specificities
and genetic differences [6,7]. The determination of the
true phylogenetic relationships within the diplomonads is
difficult. Free-living Hexamita and Trepomonas are
nested among pathogenic members of Spironucleus. Furthermore, enteromonads, are nested deep within classical
diplomonads in molecular phylogenies, suggesting that
these are secondarily monokaryotic, or that the
diplokaryotic state have multiple origins within diplomonads [4,8,9].
In this study we focus on Spironucleus barkhanus and
Spironucleus salmonicida. Both species were previously
known as S. barkhanus. However, parasites causing systemic infections in Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, Chinook
salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and Arctic char Salvelinus alpinus [10], are now classified as S. salmonicida
[11]. These parasites have caused severe problems for
fisheries [12,13]. The closely related S. barkhanus is a
commensal in wild freshwater populations of Arctic char
and grayling Thymallus thymallus [11]. These morphologically indistinguishable organisms are defined as separate species on the basis of their ecology (commensal and
parasite) and that they form two clades in gene trees [11].
The genetic divergence is between 8% and 30% for the
ribosomal RNA, alpha-tubulin and glutamate dehydrogenase genes [11]. The ATCC 50377 strain of S. salmomicida is the most studied diplomonad on the genetic level
outside the Giardia genus [14], although there is an
ongoing genome project on Spironucleus vortens [15].
The genome projects on S. salmonicida and G. intestinalis revealed reduced and compact genomes with few, if

any, genes with introns [14,16]. There are also variations
between the diplomonad genomes. A number of lineagespecific genes obtained from bacteria were detected in S.
salmonicida and the codon usages are drastically different [14]. In addition, all hexamitinid diplomonads
(including Spironucleus) utilize an alternative genetic
code, whereas the canonical code is used by members of
the Giardia genus [4,17] The level of sequence divergence
within diplomonad cells also vary extensively. Both nuclei
in the vegetative trophozoite stage of G. intestinalis are
diploid [18]. In situ hybridization studies of G. intestinalis
genotype A have shown that each nucleus contains at
least one complete copy of the genome and that the two
nuclei are partitioned equationally at cytokinesis [19].
Allelic variations are expected to accumulate in the
absence of genetic exchange between the two nuclei [20].
Nevertheless, a very low frequency of sequence heterozygosity is present in the G. intestinalis genotype A (WB)
genome [21] and no allelic sequence variation was
reported from the S. salmonicida genome [14]. Genetic
exchange might occur between the nuclei, suggesting a
mechanism that maintains a low sequence divergence
[22]. However, the efficiency of such a mechanism
appears to vary between closely related lineages; the draft
G. intestinalis GS (genotype B) genome revealed an overall allelic sequence divergence of 0.5% [7].
We have performed a comparative genomic project on
S. barkhanus and S. salmonicida, including the generation of ~5000 expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences
from S. barkhanus and an estimation of genome sizes of
both species. The goal was to increase the understanding
of the tempo and mode of genomic structure and content
evolution within the diplomonads. The present study
present several unexpected observations such as large
differences of diplomonad genome size and codon usage,
and a high level of allelic sequence variation in S.
barkhanus.

Results and Discussion
S. barkhanus and S. salmonicida are two morphologically
indistinguishable protists which have recently been classified as two distinct species based on ecological and
genetic data from a few genes [11]. We isolated S.
barkhanus from the wild freshwater salmonid grayling
(Thymallus thymallus) to further study the genetic differences between these two diplomonads. In vitro growth in
TYI-S-33 medium was successfully established for both
this new isolate and S. salmonicida (ATCC 50377),
although, the optimal growth conditions differed. The
generation time for S. barkhanus at 4°C in the presence of
bile was approximately the same as the generation time
for S. salmonicida at 15°C without bile. The morphology
is indistinguishable (Additional files 1-2) and the six ante-

rior flagella contribute to the high speed swimming, even
at 4°C (Additional files 3-4).
Origin of Spironucleus gene repertoire

We constructed a CloneMiner cDNA library from RNA
harvested from S. barkhanus (see Method section for
details). Approximately 5,000 clones were randomly
picked and sequenced. The obtained chromatograms
were clustered into 1,270 unique sequences. 831 of these
showed similarity with E values less than 1e-5 to previously known protein-coding genes outside the Spironuclues genus (Additional file 5). Putative orthologs were
found for 233 of these among the sequences from the S.
salmonicida genome survey [14]. The average identities
were 84% and 76% on the amino acid and nucleotide levels, respectively. This is in the similar range as orthologous genes between the morphologically identical G.
intestinalis genotype A (WB) and B (GS) isolates [7], indicating large genetic divergence between morphologically
similar diplomonad species.
We divided the identified protein coding genes into
three classes based on their similarities to database
sequences (Additional file 5). The first class contain 538
proteins with highest similarities to Giardia proteins [21],
strongly suggesting these to be present in the ancestral
diplomonad cell. This class contains proteins performing
basic functions in eukaryotic cells such as general metabolism, translation, flagellar function and chromatin structure. However, proteins performing functions with a
more limited distribution among eukaryotes are also
included. An enzyme involved in cyst-wall synthesis, two
enzymes in the arginine dihydrolase pathway which
enable the diplomonads to utilize arginine as an energy
source under limited oxygen conditions [23,24], and Atype flavoproteins which are widespread in anaerobic
protists, but rare in other eukaryotes [25] are all members
of this class.
A second class consists of 235 genes with homologs
present in the Giardia genome, but which show higher
similarities to homologs from organisms outside diplomonads. Many of these probably represent divergent
sequences of genes present in the common diplomonad
ancestor; most of them show almost as high similarity to
Giardia genes. A number of ribosomal and proteasomal
proteins are present in this class. Interestingly, 59 of the
71 sequences with a cysteine content of the putative coding region of more than 10% (Additional file 5) belong to
this class. Many show highest similarities to cysteine-rich
proteins in ciliates, and the conserved motifs of G. intestinalis variant surface proteins (CRGKA and GGCY [26])
could not be found. This indicates a high sequence divergence of cysteine-rich proteins within diplomonads, as
previously observed in the S. salmonicida genome survey
[14]. Indeed, these protein families were the most diver-

Page 3 of 14

gent between G. intestinalis WB and GS [7]. Annexins is
another protein family that is very divergent within diplomonads. Alpha-giardins are annexin-like proteins in a 20
member Giardia-specific protein family associated with
different cytoskeleton and membrane structures [27]. All
annexin-like proteins in Spironucleus are more similar to
annexins in other eukaryotes than to any alpha-giardin.
For example, the putative amino acid sequence of
contig160 shows 40% identity to Xenopus laevis annexin
A7, but only 27% identity to G. intestinalis alpha-5 giardin. The most parsimonious explanation probably is that
alpha-giardins evolved specifically in the Giardia branch
from typical eukaryotic annexins. However, an alternative
explanation for the large divergence of annexin-like proteins in diplomonads is that one of the two studied lineages obtained the proteins via lateral gene transfer.
The third class of genes consists of 58 sequences without matches in the G. intestinalis genome (Additional
files 5 and 6). Metabolic functions dominate among the
26 that do have putative annotations, including several
peptidases, desulfoferredoxin, fructokinase, cartenoid
isomerase and rubrerythrin (Additional file 6), suggesting
metabolic adaptation as a selection force for their maintenance in the S. barkhanus genome. Detailed phylogenetic
analyses, such as for selenophosphate synthetase (Figure
1A), would be necessary to determine the origin of these
genes; they have either been gained in the Spironucleus
lineage or been lost in the Giardia lineage. Lateral gene
transfer has indeed previously been shown to contribute
to adaptation within diplomonads and other eukaryotes
[7,14,21,28-30]. In fact, ten of the S. barkhanus sequences
have indeed close homologs among proteins identified as
recently introduced via lateral gene transfer into the S.
salmonicida genome (Additional file 6). Several of the
other proteins also likely represent acquisitions in the
Spironucleus lineage, some maybe after the divergence
between S. barkhanus and S. salmonicida. At any rate,
this class contains candidate genes for the understanding
of the diversifications of diplomonads, regardless of their
origins, as exemplified below.
A triple function of UGA as sole termination codon,
selenocysteine codon and polyadenylation signal

Spironucleus uses an alternative genetic code; UAA and
UAG encode glutamine, whereas UGA is the sole termination codon [17]. A putative selenocysteine tRNA (SelC)
was identified in the S. salmonicida genome indicating
that all 64 codons might be used to encode amino acids in
this organism [14]. Here we discovered a putative selenophosphate synthetase (SelD), an enzyme marker for selenium utilization [31]. A phylogenetic analysis shows the
S. barkhanus homolog nested within bacterial SelD
sequences (Figure 1A). Furthermore, a S. salmonicida
EST with 40% identity over 238 amino acids to ciliate

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/258

selenocysteine (Sec)-specific elongation factor (SelB) was
identified (gi: 120477278). Thus, three gene signatures
(SelB, SelC and SelD) for the Sec-decoding trait [31] have
been identified in S. salmonicida or S. barkhanus. A weak
similarity to selenoprotein W1, a previously identified
selenoprotein, was found within our dataset (Figure 1B).
A UGA codon is found in the S. barkhanus and S. salmonicida homologs of selenoprotein W1 in the amino acid
position where a selenocysteine is incorporated in other
eukaryotes (Figure 1B). Together, these observations
strongly suggest that these two diplomonads are able to
incorporate Sec into proteins using the UGA codon. It is
unknown how the translation machinery distinguish
between termination and Sec-insertion in S. barkhanus;
no canonical Sec-insertion sequences (SECIS) could be
detected within our dataset using ERPIN [32,33].
No selenium utilization trait has been reported from
Giardia to our knowledge. Indeed, no genes coding for
homologs to SelB or SelD could be found in any of the
available G. intestinalis genomes [7,21], nor in the
released sequences form the S. vortens project [15]. Interestingly, these two species encode cysteine in the homologous position of the selenocysteine in selenoprotein W1
(Figure 1B). Exchanges between Cys and Sec within selenoproteins are frequent in evolution [34]. These observations indicate that G. intestinalis and S. vortens lack the
Sec-decoding trait. If so, Sec-decoding capacity has either
been lost independently in the S. vortens and G. intestinalis lineages, or been gained in the lineage leading to S.
barkhanus and S. salmonicida. Both gains and losses of
the trait are common in bacterial evolution [34]. Interestingly, the position of S. barkhanus selenophosphate synthetase nested within prokaryotic sequences in the
phylogenetic tree (Figure 1A) indicates a recent acquisition of that gene. Furthermore, no homologs of SelB or
SelD could be identified in Trichomonas vaginalis, the
nearest neighbour of diplomonads with an available
genome sequence [35]. These findings circumstantially
support a recent gain of the selenium utilization trait in
the ancestor of S. barkhanus and S. salmonicida.
UGA probably also function as a polyadenylation signal
in S. barkhanus and S. salmonicida. The positions of the
polyA tail were mapped in 134 of the clustered
sequences. The 3' untranslated regions were found to be
short, around 13 bp (Figure 1C). This is similar to the
other studied diplomonads [14,36], but unlike other
eukaryotes [37]. The conservation pattern is very similar
between S. barkhanus and S. salmonicida, with a strong
positional correlation between the termination codon
and the beginning of the polyA-tail, but only weak conservation outside the UGA codon, the only functional
termination codon in Spironucleus [17]. In both organisms there is a preference for A in the position two bases
upstream of the termination codon and U immediately

Page 5 of 14

downstream (Figure 1C) [14]. In other studied eukaryotes, the distance between the polyadenylation signal and
the polyA site is conserved, whereas 3' untranslated
regions vary in length [37]. The positional correlation
between the termination codon and the polyA site in S.
barkhanus (Figure 1C) and S. salmonicida [14] suggests
that the single termination codon [17] likely also function
as a polyA signal, in addition to the function as a Seccodon in selenoproteins. Interestingly, a eukaryotic peptide chain release factor subunit 1 that recognizes stop
codons and terminates translation was also identified in
this survey (Additional file 5), which will make it possible
to study the interaction between polyadenylation, translational termination and selenocysteine incorporation.
A drastic shift in codon usage between the genomes

Several codons may code for the same amino acid in protein coding genes due to the degenerate nature of the
genetic code. The main determinant for codon-usage lineage-variations among genomes often is genome-wide
mutational processes, whereas selection typically is
invoked to explain differences within genomes [38,39].
The codon usage of G. intestinalis can be explained by a
combination of these forces where a subset of codons are
preferred in highly expressed genes [14,40]. The genome
survey of S. salmonicida revealed a similar pattern for the
majority of the genes [14]. However, a minority of the S.
salmonicida genes showed codon-usage patterns with
high GC3s values close to 1 although the genome in general is G+C poor. These observations were very difficult
to explain using the traditional interpretations [14,38,39].
Here we take a comparative approach to study the codon
usage in Spironucleus.
S. barkhanus has a relatively G+C-poor genome; the
average G+C-content of the EST sequences is 41% and
GC3s values below 40% for most genes (Figure 2A), suggesting a general mutational bias towards A+T. We classify genes as "highly expressed" and "weakly expressed" if
they have been found more than 20 times or less than 3
times, respectively, among the clones from the cDNA
library. The number of occurrences of a specific gene
within a non-normalized cDNA library is expected to be
roughly correlated with the amount of mRNA in the cells
harvested for the library preparation. Specific codons are
preferred in highly expressed S. barkhanus genes, as previously found in S. salmonicida [14] (data not shown).
The codon usage was explored in more detail by plotting
the effective number of codons (Enc') [41] against the
GC3s values (Figure 2A) and by correspondence analyses
on the relative synonymous codon usage (Figure 2B). The
S. barkhanus GC3s values are weakly correlated with
expression levels (Figure 2A), whereas the correspondence analysis clearly separates highly expressed genes

from weakly expressed genes (Figure 2B). This is in agreement with the observation that the preferred codons are a
mixture of G+C rich and G+C poor codons [14]. Overall,
the S. barkhanus codon usage is similar to S. salmonicida,
except that the variation in GC3s values appear less
extreme in S. barkhanus [14] (Figure 2A).
This aspect of codon usage variation between S.
barkhanus and S. salmonicida was studied in more detail
by extracting homologous regions of 233 putatively
orthologous genes from the two datasets. The S.
barkhanus orthologs of S. salmonicida genes with unusually high GC3s values tend to have lower GC3s values (Figure 2C). In S. salmonicida, 14 genes show GC3s values
above 75%, whereas none of their putative S. barkhanus
orthologs do (Figure 2C). We plotted the difference
between the putative orthologs against the frequency of
non-synonymous changes in the gene (dN), which is a
measure of divergence, to examine whether the genes
that show a drastic shift in GC3s values tend to represent
divergent genes (Figure 2D). Many of the genes with large

differences in GC3s show small non-synonymous divergences. Thus, the drastic difference between the two
genomes is unlikely due to erroneous assignments of
orthologs. These observations suggest that divergent
codon usages has emerged rather recently in a subset of
the S. salmonicida genes [14], or been lost in the S.
barkhanus lineage. S. salmonicida genes with extremely
high GC3s values were correlated with genomic regions
with unusually high G+C content [14]. Our data indicate
that these genomic regions are less pronounced in the S.
barkhanus genome.
Sequence heterogeneity between S. barkhanus alleles

Many S. barkhanus sequences show high identity within
the dataset. For example, there are seven sequences annotated as alpha-tubulin. Using a BLASTN E value cutoff of
1e-20 the 1,270 unique sequences were divided into 1,097
groups consisting of 1 to 7 sequences. 107 of these consisted of two or more sequences (Additional file 5). This
indicates that S. barkhanus encodes a large number of
alleles and/or paralogs. Manual inspection of clustered

Roxström-Lindquist et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:258
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/258

sequences revealed heterogeneity also between aligned
EST sequences indicating the occurrence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). One or more SNPs were
identified in 166 of the 1270 sequences, using the Polybayes software [42] (Additional file 5). These results were
surprising given that the genomic survey of S. salmonicida failed to indicate any allelic sequence variation [14].
There are several possible origins of the SNPs detected in
the S. barkhanus dataset. They could represent alleles
present within a single S. barkhanus lineage and/or alleles
from different S. barkhanus lineages present in the grayling and maintained during 13 passages of in vitro culture. In principle, they could also be cloning artefacts
produced during the preparation of the EST library. We
performed additional experiments and analyses to study
the phenomenon in more detail and to distinguish
between these alternatives.
The genes encoding enolase, ribosomal protein S2, glutamate dehydrogenase, heat shock protein 70 and pyruvate kinase were selected for cloning experiments. All are
single-copy genes in the G. intestinalis genome [21] and
show varying frequencies of SNPs in the S. barkhanus
EST sequences (Table 1). Primers were designed that
amplified ~500 bp regions in each gene from S.
barkhanus and S. salmonicida genomic DNA. The PCR
products were cloned and between 10 and 68 individual
clones were sequenced from each amplified region. The
cloning experiments identified all but two of the 20 SNPs
identified in the S. barkhanus ESTs with the Polybayes
software, all with the same variation (Table 1). An additional ten SNPs not found in the S. barkhanus EST data
were identified in the cloning experiments (Table 1). All
were detected in multiple clones, except one only found
in a single clone of heat shock protein 70. The absence of
these SNPs in the EST data is likely due to poor coverage,
possibly in combination with differential expression of
alternative alleles. Indeed, five of the novel SNPs were
found in the glutamate dehydrogenase, a gene represented by very few EST clones (Table 1). These results
strongly suggest that the variation in the EST library corresponds to sequence variation present in the genomic
DNA, showing that the SNPs identified in the EST data
are not due to cloning artefacts.
Interestingly, the SNPs are not evenly distributed
among the genes selected for the cloning experiments.
Four S. barkhanus genes have four or more SNPs,
whereas none was found in the ribosomal protein S2
(Table 1). The picture is similar in the EST data; some S.
barkhanus genes lack SNPs, whereas others have large
numbers (Additional file 5). This variation does not
appear to be correlated with the expected level of conservation. For example, ribosomal protein L13 is present in
several highly similar contigs in the EST assembly, each
containing SNPs, whereas ribosomal protein S2 only has

Page 7 of 14

a single allele (Table 1 and Additional file 5). There are
several plausible explanations for these observations. In
principle, the sequence variation could originate from
clonal S. barkhanus lineages present in the fish and then
maintained in the culture. If so, the level of variation
would be expected to be relatively evenly distributed
among the genes with the most conserved genes showing
the least variation. This does not seem to be the case
(Table 1 and Additional file 5). However, the observed
pattern could originate from sexual recombination
between two different lineages followed by autogamy that
purges most of the allelic variation from each lineage,
suggesting the presence of at least two lineages in the culture. Yet another explanation is that the sequence variation represents allelic differences within a single clone, or
very closely related lineages, of S. barkhanus. In this case
the level of variation could vary considerably between
genes due to recent local within-cell recombination that
removes allelic variation. We tend to favour the latter
model, mainly because it agrees with the patterns
observed in the genomes of G. intestinalis GS [7], and S.
vortens (see below). However, additional data is clearly
needed to distinguish between the alternatives.
The degree of sequence variation differs between
Spironucleus species

Comparison of sequences from individual clones from
PCR reactions revealed between one and eleven alleles
for the five amplified S. barkhanus genes (Table 1), which
is puzzling if they are assumed to come from a single lineage. Closer examination of the occurrence of SNPs
among the alleles showed that all SNPs often were represented in a subset of the alleles. For example, the thirteen
SNPs in S. barkhanus pyruvate kinase were represented
in three alleles. The other nine alleles are different combinations of these three major alleles (Additional file 7). 57
of the 68 clones represent these major alleles (Table 1). It
could be that the minor alleles are artefacts of the cloning
and sequencing procedure; chimeras are expected to
occur in amplifications of closely related sequences [43].
Using this rationale, the PCR experiments identified
between one and five major alleles for the five cloned S.
barkhanus genes (Table 1). Duplication of a segment in
the S barkhanus genome, followed by divergence could
result in more than four distinct sequences of alleles and
paralogs, even if the organism is tetraploid.
Ten SNPs were found in the S. salmonicida glutamate
dehydrogenase gene, whereas none were found in any of
the other four S. salmonicida genes in the cloning experiments (Table 1). The presence of SNPs in glutamate dehydrogenase is probably due to a gene duplication followed
by divergence; our preliminary assembly of ~4× coverage
of the S. salmonicida genome indicates distinct upstream
sequences for two paralogs (unpublished data). Thus, our

study indicates a low level of allelic sequence divergence
in S. salmonicida, as suggested by the previous genomic
survey [14].
Available sequences from the genome project of S.
vortens [44] were used to test whether allelic variation is
present in this Spironucleus species. Sequences covering
the homologous region of the five genes were identified
among the >200,000 genomic survey sequences (GSS)
and >25,000 EST sequences available at the NCBI [45].
No sequences were found for glutamate dehydrogenase,
whereas between five and 32 GSSs, and between nine and
hundreds of ESTs were found for the other four genes
(Table 2). The number of identified SNPs varied extensively between the four genes; none were found for the
enolase gene, whereas more than 60 SNPs were present in
the pyruvate kinase sequences (Table 2). The number of
alleles appeared to be high for the three genes for which
SNPs were found (data not shown). Thus, extensive allelic
sequence variation is present in S. vortens.
An emerging picture of allelic sequence variation in
diplomonads

Our data indicate large variations in the degree of allelic
sequence variation between different genes and different
member of the genus Spironucleus. This is similar to the
situation in G. intestinalis; WB (genotype A) and GS
(genotype B) showed <0.01% and 0.5% variations, respectively [7,21]. Furthermore, G. intestinalis genotype B isolates repeatedly show higher frequencies of double-peaks

in sequence chromatograms from PCR amplifications
from patient samples in epidemiological studies of Giardia than genotype A isolates [46,47]. The allelic sequence
divergence in G. intestinalis GS is non-randomly distributed along the chromosomes with large regions with very
low frequencies of SNPs followed by large regions with
high divergence [7]. Similarly, some Spironucleus genes
lack SNPs, whereas others have large numbers (Tables 1,
2 and Additional file 5).
In G. intestinalis GS most genes with SNPs seem to
group into two, or sometimes three alleles [7]. Our data
suggest higher numbers of alleles for many of the S.
barkhanus genes (Table 1 and Additional file 5). Ten proteins are represented by five or more closely related
sequences which correspond to alleles and/or paralogs.
An additional nine proteins with three or four highly similar contig sequences show allelic variation within individual clusters suggesting that also these have five or
more alleles. A similar picture emerges from the limited
analyses of S. vortens data (Table 2). The genome project
of S. vortens reported large difficulties with genome
assembly [15]. Total scaffold and contig lengths were 104
and 33 Mb, respectively, which is much larger than the
previously estimated genome size of 16 Mb [44]. A probable cause of the problems is the presence of extensive
allelic variation for a large part of the genome. Local gene
duplications followed by divergence may also contribute
to the high allelic numbers found in S. vortens and S.
barkhanus. Interestingly, the S. vortens genes with the

highest number of SNPs in our study have the largest
number of GSSs (Table 2), circumstantially suggesting
duplications of these genes. Comparative genome size
estimates of S. barkhanus and S. salmonicida were performed to test whether the differences in allelic sequence
variation were correlated with genome size variations
(Figure 3 and Additional file 8).
Divergent genome sizes of S. barkhanus and S. salmonicida

We studied the genome size using flow cytometry analysis of S. barkhanus and S. salmonicida cells with fluorescently labelled DNA (Figure 3). The total amount of DNA
in each cell was compared to the amount of DNA in G.
intestinalis WB trophozoites, which has been estimated
to have a haploid genome size of 12 Mb [48]. Exponentially growing Giardia trophozoites display two peaks
with cells in the G1 and G2/M phases of the cell cycle
with ploidies of 4N and 8N, respectively. The majority of
cells can be found in the G2/M phase [18]. The G1 peak
corresponds to a total genome size of 48 Mb (4 × 12 Mb)
and the G2/M peak to a genome size of 96 Mb (8 × 12
Mb) (Figure 3A and 3C). S. barkhanus has two major
peaks that correspond to total genome sizes of around 72
and 144 Mb (Figure 3B). This corresponds to a haploid
genome size of ~18 Mb, if a cycling of ploidy between 4N
and 8N is assumed. The major peaks of S. salmonicida are
very close to the peaks of G. intestinalis, suggesting a haploid genome size around 12 Mb for S. salmonicida (Figure
3CD).
We also studied the genome size using pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE). Unfortunately, the chromosomes
were poorly separated in our PFGE experiments, preventing precise estimations of genome sizes using this
method (Additional file 8). Nevertheless, our genome size
determinations using flow cytometry show a large difference in haploid genome sizes between S. barkhanus and
S. salmonicida. This suggests that genome sizes are
dynamic within diplomonads and may differ considerably
even between relatively closely related and morphological
indistinguishable species.

Conclusions
We have performed a comparative study of S. barkhanus
and S. salmonicida, as a part of our ongoing project on
comparative genomics in diplomonads. Traits which distinguish these from other studied diplomonads were
identified, such as the ability to incorporate selenocysteine into proteins. Our results also indicate that the
genome sizes differ drastically between the two morphologically indistinguishable Spironucleus species. There
are also differences in codon usages and the occurrence
of allelic sequence variation. A large number of S.
barkhanus genes have high frequencies of SNPs, whereas
S. salmonicida genes show sequence homogeneity. The
presence and absence of SNPs among genes and genomes
are the results of interplay of mutations and recombinatory events within and between isolates. In G. intestinalis,
the presence of meiotic sex has been suggested [49], the
nuclei have been suggested to meet in the cyst with the
possibility of genetic exchange [22], and exchange of
genetic material between natural isolates has been
described [50]. Our data suggest that the outcome of
these different putative processes may be rather different
in closely related diplomonads. Further studies are obviously needed to understand the importance of the various
putative phenomena acting on diplomonad genomes.
The observations in this study are in agreement with our
studies of G. intestinalis genomes [7]. Thus, large
genomic differences between morphologically indistinguishable isolates are widespread among diplomonads.
Methods
Organisms and cultures

Trophozoites of S. barkhanus were isolated from the gall
bladder of the freshwater salmonid grayling in Glomma
River, south-eastern Norway. An axenic culture of S.
barkhanus was grown at 4°C in TYI-S-33 medium supplemented with bile according to Keister [51]. The identity of the isolate was verified by sequencing of the small
subunit ribosomal RNA gene PCR amplified from the
genome [52]. S. salmonicida (ATCC 50377), isolated from

a muscle abscess in Atlantic salmon Vesteraalen, northern Norway (previously known as S. barkhanus [11]) was
obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) and grown in axenic culture following the ATCC
protocol.
RNA isolation, cDNA library construction and sequencing

Exponentially growing S. barkhanus were harvested at
passage 13. After collection by centrifugation (5 min at
2000 rpm, 4°C) the cells were directly lysed in Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen) and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's instruction. The amount and
quality were analyzed by nanodrop and formaldehydedenaturing 1% agarose gel before total RNA was ethanol
precipitated. Following the isolation of mRNA using
Poly(A)PuristTM MAG system (Ambion), directed and
size-fractionated cDNA libraries was made using the
CloneMinerTM cDNA Library Construction Kit (Invitrogen). Positive transformants were manually picked for
sequencing. Sequencing template preparation was made
with the TempliPhi DNA sequencing Template Amplification Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Sequencing was carried out on MegaBACE sequencing system using M13
forward primer and DYEnamic ET Dye Terminator Cycle

Sequencing Kit for MegaBACE DNA analysis systems
(Amersham Biosciences).
Sequence analyses

Base-calling and vector screening were performed on the
4,977 obtained chromatograms using Phred, version
0.020425 [53]. The EST sequences were clustered using
the Phrap assembler, version 0.990329 with the default
settings [53], which yielded 478 preliminary contigs with
two or more sequences. 990 sequences did not show any
significant overlap (singlets). Both contigs and singlets
were screened for high quality sequences using the
pruneEST script (obtained from Daniel Nilsson, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden) which trims the sequences based
on the quality scores. The minimal length of high quality
sequence was set to 100 bp. Two contigs and 194 singlets
did not match the set criteria and were removed from
further analyses. A single contig were identified to be a
chimera and were split into two contigs. 18S ribosomal
RNA (rRNA) sequences were identified in two singlets,
and one contig was identified to contain a 28S rRNA
sequence; these were removed from further analyses.
Sequences with inserts in the opposite direction were
identified as starting with a stretch of Ts (8), or as having

Roxström-Lindquist et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:258
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/258

significant matches in the wrong direction to known
genes (3); these were reversed. This procedure resulted in
476 contigs with two reads or more and 794 singlets. The
average and median lengths of these 1,270 sequences
were 537 and 482 bp, respectively.
A stretch of eight or more As were in the end of the
EST is indicative of mRNA polyadenylation; 179 such
ESTs were identified. Based on sequence similarity to
genes in the databases 134 of these were annotated as
coding genes (see below). The regions around the 3' end
of these genes were aligned based on the position of the
termination codons (UGA), and a sequence logo was created using WebLogo [54].
The sequence data were deposited in dbEST at NCBI
with the accession numbers GW585169-GW589878.
Databases and similarity searches

All databases used in the analyses were downloaded in
May 2008. The non-redundant protein database were
downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) [45]. To broaden the taxonomic
sampling of microbial eukaryotes the protein databases
from the genome projects of the oomyctete Phytophthora
ramorum and Phytophthora sojae, the diatoms Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum, the
green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and the heterolobosean Naegleria gruberi were downloaded from the US
Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute [55]. Protein translations of 168,875 EST clusters from 54 diverse
eukaryotic lineages from Taxonomically Broad EST Database (TBestDB) [56] were also included. Similarity
searches using BLASTX, version 2.2.17 [57] were performed for the 1,270 unique sequences against the downloaded protein databases. 831 sequences gave a hit with
an E value less than 1e-5. Putative open reading frames
(orfs) were extracted using the indication of the coding
frame from the BLAST result file and translated into
putative protein sequences.
Phylogenetic analyses

Phylogenetic analyses were performed on a putative selenophosphate synthetase (SelD) homolog. An automatic
phylogenetic tree was generated using the Phylogenie
package [58], as described previously [14]. 28 sequences
from the obtained tree were selected to represent the
diversity of SelD in the three domains of life. 160 unambiguously aligned amino acid positions were identified by
eye. Using Modelgenerator [59], BLOSUM62 + Γ was
identified as the optimal substitution model. Maximum
likelihood analysis with 500 bootstrap replicates was performed with RAxML, version 7.0.4 [60]. Bayesian analyses with two independent runs for 500,000 generations
were performed with MrBayes, version 3.1.2 [61], using
the default settings, except for the optimal substitution

Page 11 of 14

models. The first 100,000 generations were discarded as
burnin.
Codon usage analyses

The 831 sequences, for which putative orfs could be
assigned, corresponded to 682 unique groups using the
criteria of clustering sequences with pairwise BLASTN
matches of <1e-20. The frequencies of G+C in fourfold
degenerate positions (GC3s) and (Nc'), a measure of the
effective number of codons used in a gene which take the
background nucleotide composition into account [41],
were calculated using INCA [62]. A correspondence analysis on the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values using the software CodonW [63] was performed to
examine the variation of codon usage among genes.
245 of these 682 groups were found to have BLASTP
matches to putative proteins from S. salmonicida [14]
with E values <1e-40 spanning 100 or more aligned amino
acid positions. In twelve cases two different S. barkhanus
orfs matched the same S. salmonicida orf; only the pair
with the lowest E value was retained for further analyses.
The amino acid and nucleotide sequences for the aligned
homologous regions of the 233 putative orthologous pairs
of S. barkhanus and S. salmonicida sequences were
extracted. GC3s and Nc' were calculated using INCA [62]
for the orthologs. For each orthologous pair the amino
acid sequences were aligned using ClustalW [64], and this
alignment was used as a guide to align the nucleotide
sequences using the transAlign.pl software [65]. Synonymous (ds) and nonsynonymous (dN) substitution rates
were calculating using the Yang and Nielsen method [66]
using the PAML program package [67].
Allelic sequence variation

Polybayes.pl is a software designed to identify single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within assemblies of
sequences produced using the Sanger technology that
takes quality values into account [42]. This tool was used
to quantify the sequence heterogeneity within assembled
clusters. The genes encoding enolase, ribosomal protein
S2, glutamate dehydrogenase, heat shock protein 70 and
pyruvate kinase were selected for further analyses of the
observed intragenomic sequence heterogeneity. Verification and discovery of polymorphisms in fragments of the
enolase, ribosomal protein S2, glutamate dehydrogenase,
cytoplasmic heat shock protein 70 and pyruvate kinase in
S. barkhanus and S. salmonicida were accomplished by
cloning and sequencing of individual PCR clones. Low
degeneracy primer-pairs targeting ~500 bp regions in
both species were designed based on alignments of the
genes (Additional file 9) and recommendations in the
Phusion HotStart polymerase instruction manual. PCR
reactions were performed in 1× Phusion HF buffer with
1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 μM dNTPs, 0.5 μM of forward and

Roxström-Lindquist et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:258
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/258

reverse primers, 40 ng S. barkhanus or S. salmonicida
genomic DNA and 0.8 U Phusion HS DNA polymerase
(Finnzymes) in a total volume of 40 μl. The reactions
were incubated for 2 min at 98°C followed by 32 cycles of
98°C for 15 sec, 55°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 25 sec, and were
then held at 4°C.
The PCR products were purified using the QIAquick
PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and eluted in 30 μl ddH2O.
Purified PCR products were A-tailed by adding 25 μl of
respective eluate to one PuReTaq Ready-To-Go PCR bead
(GE Healthcare) followed by incubation at 72°C for 10
min. A-tailed PCR fragments were cloned by the TOPO
TA cloning Kit for Sequencing (Invitrogen) following the
manufacturers' recommendations, except that the cloning reactions were desalted by dialyzing 1 hr on a 0.025
μm VSWP membrane filter (Millipore) against a large
excess of ddH2O before transformation into TOP10 Electrocomp E. coli cells (Invitrogen).
For each gene, 10-14 clones were picked and grown
over-night followed by plasmid mini-preps using NucleoSpin Plasmid kit (Macherey-Nagel). The plasmids were
sequenced using -40 M13 forward primer at the Uppsala
Genome Center using BigDye® Terminator v3.1 chemistry
and capillary electrophoresis on an ABI3730XL (Applied
Biosystems). Two S. barkhanus genes were selected for
deeper coverage. An additional ~50 clones of each of
these were inoculated into 100 μl 2×YT-Kanamycin (50
μg/ml) in a multi-well culture plate and grown 20 hrs at
37°C without shaking. 1 μl of the culture was used for
amplification with TempliPhi Amplification Kit (GE
Healthcare) according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Sequencing reactions was performed as above.
Post-reaction cleanup was performed with Sephadex G50 (GE Healthcare) micro columns prepared in Multiscreen plates (Millipore).
Genome size estimations

Genome sizes were estimated using PFGE and flow
cytometry. For PFGE, exponentially growing cells were
harvested by centrifugation (10 min at 2,500 × g, 4°C) and
washed twice in cold TSE buffer (10 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0,
100 mM NaCl and 50 mM EDTA). The cells were resuspended in TSE buffer to the concentration of 2 - 10 × 108
cells/ml, and were equilibrated to 40°C. The cell suspension were mixed with an equal volume of 1.6% (w/v)
InCert agarose gel (Lonza Rockland, Inc., Rockland, ME,
USA) equilibrated to 42°C and solidified as plugs at 4°C.
After 20 min, plugs containing approximately 1 × 107
cells/100 μl plug, were incubated in cell lysis buffer (1%
Lauroyl Sarcosine Sodium Salt (Sigma), 0.5 M EDTA pH
8.0 and 2 mg/ml Proteinase K (Roche)) at 42°C for 48 h,
changing the buffer after 24 h. The plugs were rinsed
twice in TE buffer for 30 min and stored in TE buffer at
4°C.

Plugs containing chromosomal DNA were washed
twice for 30 min in 0.5 × TBE buffer (80 mM Tris, 80 mM
boric acid and 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and directly loaded
and sealed into wells of a 1% (w/v) Seakem GTG agarose
gel (PFGE grade, Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA). PFGE
was performed in 0.5 × TBE using CHEF Mapper system
(Bio-Rad). Different sets of running conditions were used
for separation of the chromosomes. Chromosomes of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (0.225 - 2.2 Mb), Hansenula
wingei (1.05 - 3.13 Mb) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe
(3.5 - 5.7 Mb) (Bio-Rad) were used as standard DNA size
markers. After electrophoresis, gels were stained with
ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml) for 20 min, destained in
distilled water for 30 min and photographed under UVlight. Densitometry analysis of the obtained bands was
performed using the SynGene software.
Protists cells were fixed and analyzed for flow cytometry according to Bernander et al. [18].
