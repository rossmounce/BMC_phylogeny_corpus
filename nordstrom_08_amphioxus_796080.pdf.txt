Abstract
Background: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are one of the largest families of genes in
mammals. Branchiostoma floridae (amphioxus) is one of the species most closely related species to
vertebrates.
Results: Mining and phylogenetic analysis of the amphioxus genome showed the presence of at
least 664 distinct GPCRs distributed among all the main families of GPCRs; Glutamate (18),
Rhodopsin (570), Adhesion (37), Frizzled (6) and Secretin (16). Surprisingly, the Adhesion GPCR
repertoire in amphioxus includes receptors with many new domains not previously observed in
this family. We found many Rhodopsin GPCRs from all main groups including many amine and
peptide binding receptors and several previously uncharacterized expansions were also identified.
This genome has however no genes coding for bitter taste receptors (TAS2), the sweet and umami
(TAS1), pheromone (VR1 or VR2) or mammalian olfactory receptors.
Conclusion: The amphioxus genome is remarkably rich in various GPCR subtypes while the main
GPCR groups known to sense exogenous substances (such as Taste 2, mammalian olfactory,
nematode chemosensory, gustatory, vomeronasal and odorant receptors) in other bilateral species
are absent.

Background
The superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)
is one of the largest families of proteins in mammals [1].
GPCRs participate in a tremendous diversity of physiological functions by playing a key role in the mediation of
extracellular signals into cells while approximately 50% of
all marketed drugs act on GPCRs [2]. The superfamily can
be divided according to the GRAFS system into five main
families; Glutamate, Rhodopsin, Adhesion, Frizzled and
Secretin [3]. These main families arose prior the split of
nematodes from the chordate lineage. The Rhodopsin family has been very successful in evolutionary terms, repre-

senting about 60% of the GPCRs repertoire of eight
bilateria species. However, the Rhodopsin family seems not
to be present in Dictyostelium discoideum [4-6]. The Rhodopsin family can be divided in four main groups (α-, β- γand δ) with 13 main branches and previous studies have
shown that members within each of the four main groups
seem to be found in most bilaterial species, while the representation of each of the main branches is highly variable
[4,6-8].
Amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae) is a small cephalochordate that spends much of its time buried in the sand.

It is one of the closest now living relatives to vertebrates.
Amphioxus shares several features with vertebrates like a
dorsal, hollow nerve cord, notochord, segmental muscles
and pharyngeal gill slits. On the other hand, they are missing the pronounced head region of vertebrates as well as
not having neural crest cells functioning similar to those
in vertebrates, paraxial skeletal tissue and some visceral
organs [9]. Lately it has been argued on the basis of molecular phylogenetic data that tunicates, such as Ciona intestinalis, could be more closely related to vertebrates than
cephalochordates are [10]. GPCRs have been mined from
the C. intestinalis genome while very little has been known
about GPCRs in the most basal Cephalochordates such as
amphioxus. However, this genome has just recently been
sequenced and the first genome paper will soon be published. Version 1.0 is released in the form of scaffolds on
the Joint Genome Institute homepage [11]. It has been
predicted that this genome will be very important for the
understanding of the evolution of many vertebrate gene
families.
We have performed a detailed mining and phylogenetic
analysis of the gene repertoire of GPCRs in amphioxus.
We found that this genome has a highly diversified set of
genes coding for GPCRs which provides insight into evolutionary aspects of these.

Results & Discussion
We identified at least 664 unique GPCRs using our highly
diversified seeding datasets. Most of these are found in the
main families [3]; Glutamate (18), Rhodopsin (570), Adhesion (37), Frizzled (6) and Secretin (16) (see Fig. 1). We
did, however, not find any bitter taste (Taste 2) or vomeronasal (VR1) receptor. These types of receptors are abundant in rodents and most likely all other non-primate
mammals but are rare in fish and chicken [8]. Neither did
we find evidence for any members of the many pre-vertebrate lineage-specific expansions such as the nematode
chemosensory receptors, the gustatory receptors from
insects, the odorant receptors from Drosophila melanogaster, MLO receptors in plants or fungal pheromone
(STE2 and STE3) from yeast [4,12]. We found, however,
two sequences that show some similarity with the cAMPbinding receptors from slime moulds but the identity is
fairly low (25.6%) and further work needs to determine if
they are true cAMP receptors.
The Adhesion family of GPCRs has vague similarity with
the Secretin receptors in the transmembrane (TM) regions
but their structural and functional properties are very different [3]. There are 33 known Adhesion receptors in
human and these have characteristic long N-termini containing multiple functional domains [13,14], known to
be present in other protein families. Interestingly, we
found a very rich repertoire of Adhesion GPCRs, in total

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/9

37, in amphioxus(see Fig. 2 and Additional file 1, figure
S1). Some of the mammalian groups [8,13] are missing,
such as the groups I (lectomedin receptors) and II (epidermal growth factor module-containing receptors and cell
differentiating antigen receptor) that is likely to have
evolved late in the vertebrate lineage [15]. Three of the
Adhesion groups have both mammalian and amphioxus
members. These are group III (orphans, expressed in
CNS), V (orphans) and VIII (orphans with highly variable
N-terminal length). One orthologous receptor to the very
long G protein-coupled receptor 1 (VLGR1) is also
present. The remaining missing groups are group IV
(CELSR with multiple cadherin domains), VI (GPR110,
GPR111, GPR113, GPR115 and GPR116) and VII (brainspecific angiogenesis inhibitor receptors). Many of the
amphioxus Adhesion GPCRs have the GPS domain, which
are characteristic for the Adhesion family and not found in
any other GPCR family including the Secretin receptors.
Moreover, many of the amphioxus Adhesion GPCRs have
multiple domains in the N-termini, which is another
important feature of the mammalian Adhesion GPCRs.
These N-termini are likely to mediate cell-to-cell interaction which for instance could allow participation in different types of cell guidance [16]. Surprisingly, we found
several novel domains in the N-termini of the amphioxus
Adhesion GPCRs like Somatomedin B, Kringle, Lectin Ctype and SRCR (for more details see Fig. 2) which to our
knowledge are unique for amphioxus among the GPCRs.
Also the domains LDLa, Immunoglobulin I-set, CUB and
TNFR were found and they can not be found in mammal
Adhesion GPCRs [13]. Although; especially interesting is
the Kringle and Somatomedin B domains which are
found in sequences from a previously uncharacterized
Adhesion expansion of ten genes (Fig 2). The Kringle
domain (see alignment in Additional file 2, figure S2) is a
protein-binding domain [17] present in urokinase-type
plasminogen activator (uPA) while the Somatomedin B
domain (Additional file 2, figure S1) can be found in vitronectin [18]. These two proteins interact and the
Somatomedin B domain and helps in the localization of
uPA to focal adhesions in microvessel endothelial cells.
Interestingly, all of these domains not previously identified in Adhesion GPCRs, have a large number of conserved
cysteines which is a feature consistent with many other
common domains found in this family. This similarity
could suggest that these domains are inserted through
domain shuffling of similar stretches of DNA. Interestingly, many of these new domains have recognised cell
adhesion properties and participate in cell guidance. The
genes in the other cluster in this family share a resemblance to invertebrate genes according to the top five hits
in BLAST searches against the NCBIs (National Center for
Biotechnology Information) non-redundant (nr) database. These invertebrate genes are primarily from either
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus which is, according to Delsuc

The figure summarizes our findings in amphioxus in comparison with human GPCRs. The shape of the tree and the division are
adopted from [4] and the black dots represent core nodes. The families are GLU, Glutamate; Rhod, Rhodopsin; ADH, Adhesion;
FZD/TAS2, Frizzled/Taste2; SEC, Secretin; OA, Ocular albinism receptors; VR, Vomeronasal receptors. The Rhodopsin family is
further split into α-, β- γ- and δ-groups. The subgroups in α are AMIN, serotonin/dopamine/adrenergic/trace amine receptors;
MEC, melanocortin/Lysophospholipid (EDG)/adenosin/cannabinoid receptors; MTN, Melanotonin receptors; OPN, opsin-like
receptors; PTG, prostaglandin receptors. In γ: CHEM, Chemokine-like receptors; MCH, Melanocyte concentrating hormone
receptors; SOG, somatostatin/opioid/galanin receptors. In δ: LGR, glycoprotein binding receptors; MRG, MAS-related receptors; OLF, olfactory receptors; PUR, purine-like receptors. Orange leafs only hold amphioxus transcripts, purple only human
and green leaves represent branches that hold genes from both species. The annotation at the end of each leaf is the number
of GPCRs in each branch. The number without parenthesis is for amphioxus and that one within parenthesis is the number of
human GPCRs according to [13].

et al., closely related to amphioxus [10] or, more interestingly, from the more distantly related cnidarian Nematostella vectensis. In average 4.4 of these first five hits are from
invertebrate species (see Additional file 3). These findings
suggest that the Adhesion family, with its unique structural
and functional characteristics, has a very long evolutionary history and that these are likely to be present in most
vertebrates. Moreover, these properties seem to have

undergone further diversification within the lineage leading to amphioxus, and are likely to have gained additional
roles in cell guidance.
The Glutamate family of GPCRs, also known as family C,
have previously been divided into eight groups with the
largest, the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs)
containing eight members in humans. In addition, the

package, an e-value cut-off at 0.01 and the local PFAM models. Human domains were adopted, along with group annotations,
from [13]. The symbols and abbreviations are shown in the lower left corner. The abbreviations stand for: GPS, GPCR proteolytic site; EGF, epidermal growth factor; HBD, hormone-binding domain; Ig, immunoglobulin; OLF, olfactomedin; GBL, galactose-binding lectin domain; CA, cadherin domains; LamG, laminin; LRR, leucine rich repeats; SEA, sperm protein, enterokinase,

Kringle, Kringle domain; SRCR, Scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain.
Glutamate family contains GABA (gamma amino butyric
acid) B receptor, the calcium sensing receptor (CASR) and
the related amino acid binding GPRC6A, taste receptors
for sweet and umami (TAS1Rs), the orphan GPR158 as
well as GPRC5 receptors, a group of four related orphan
receptors. Moreover, the Glutamate family in mammals
contain the large family of pheromone receptors designated vomeronasal receptors type 2 (V2Rs) which in the
mouse genome contains over 50 functional genes while
all V2Rs in the human genome are pseudogenes [19]. In
amphioxus, we identified 17 receptor sequences from the

Glutamate family (Additional file 1, figure S4) while the
human genome contains 22 sequences [19]. All the
amphioxus sequences except three are most similar to vertebrate sequences according to a BLAST search against
NCBIs nr dataset (see Additional file 3). Two of the invertebrate-like sequences hit insect related genes while the
third hits genes from the invertebrates Tribolium castaneum, S. purpuratus, Apis mellifera, N. vectensis and the
vertebrate Tetraodon nigroviridis. Of the eight mammalian groups, four are represented in amphioxus while the
branches of TAS1Rs, CASR, GPRC6A and V2Rs are miss-

ing. TAS1R, GPRC6A, and V2Rs were previously found to
be present in the teleost Danio rerio and missing in C.
intestinalis [19] and our findings here support that these
receptor groups are specific for vertebrate species. Curiously, we did not find the gene for CASR in amphioxus
which has previously been observed in Caenorhabditis
elegans, indicating that this receptor was lost specifically
in the lineage leading to amphioxus.
Amphioxus has also a characteristic Secretin family of
GPCRs with distinctive features of a hormone binding
domain in the N-termini. In line with all known vertebrate species, amphioxus does not have any of the methuselah receptors [20], which are related to the Secretin
receptors and found in arthropods. The presence of typical
Secretin GPCRs in amphioxus provides further evidence
that Secretin and Adhesion are separate evolutionary
branches in vertebrates. The Secretin family can be divided
into five main branches a) Corticotrophin Releasing Factor (CRF); b) Secretin (SCT), Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide
(VIP), Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide
(PACAP) and Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone
(GHRH); c) Glucagon (GCG), Glucagon-Like Peptide
(GLP), Glucose Insulinotropic Peptide (GIP); d) Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) and e) Calcitonin (CAL) and Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) [21,22] of which
groups a, d and e are found in amphioxus (see Additional
file 1, figure S5). Recent studies on the Secretin family
shows that the receptors in group a and e are ancient and
found in both deuterostoma and protostoma [23], but the
sequences we identified in amphioxus all show a closer
relationship with vertebrates (see Additional file 3). These
branches, together with group d, are also present in
amphioxus while we do not find any receptors from group
b and c in amphioxus. The missing groups contain the
Secretin GPCRs binding gut peptides in mammals, suggesting that these functions are missing in amphioxus (see
Additional file 4, table S2). On the other hand, several of
the Secretin receptors (group a and e) that mediate
hypothalamus/pituitary signalling in mammals are
present (see Additional file 4, table S1). This may suggest
that parts of the gut functions found in vertebrates are
missing or are regulated differently in amphioxus compared to vertebrates. However, there are good evidence
that amphioxus has GPCRs that are likely to participate in
endocrine functions that may resemble that of hypothalamus and pituitary in mammals [24], such as corticotropin
releasing hormone receptor, somatostatin receptors and
vasopressin/oxytocin receptors (Additional file 4, table
S1). It is also notable that several GPCRs known to participate in pancreatic functions are missing, such as cholecystokinin receptor A and B, gastric-inhibitory peptide
receptor and the secretin receptor (Additional file 4, table
S2). However, insulin like peptides [25] and receptors

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/9

[26] have been shown to be present suggesting presence of
some of the most fundamental pancreatic functions.
The Frizzled family contains ten frizzled and the
smoothened receptor in most mammals and are the most
well conserved of all GPCR families both regarding family
members and primary amino acid sequence [8]. Frizzled
receptors are found in all bilateral species and are crucial
for early embryonic development while being the receptor
for Wnt and Sonic hedgehog. Frizzled-like receptors have
also been found in the unicellular slime mold D. discodieum which was hypothesized to carry 25 frizzled genes
in its genome [5], although these clearly have a borderline
similarity to mammalian Frizzled GPCRs [6]. We found
five Frizzled receptors as well as an ortholog to
smoothened in amphioxus (Additional file 1, figure S2).
These are all vertebrate like according to their five best hit
against NCBIs nr dataset. This is in line with our previous
study indicating that vertebrates, including teleost fish,
have a repertoire similar to that of humans, while invertebrates have fewer; between 5 (C. elegans) and 7 (D. melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae and C. intestinalis) Frizzled
GPCRs [4]. The increased number of Frizzled GPCRs probably reflects a requirement for higher signal diversity for
formation of the more complex body plan and, in particular, the more complex nervous system of vertebrates.
The Rhodopsin family of GPCRs constitutes the largest family of GPCRs in vertebrates (Fig. 3). The largest group of
Rhodopsin GPCRs in mammals are the mammalian type of
olfactory receptors, comprising 388 members in humans.
This type of olfactory receptors are also found in chicken
[8] while there are markedly fewer in fish such as D. rerio
and Takifugu rubripes [4] but we can not identify these in
amphioxus. The Rhodopsin GPCRs have been divided into
four main groups, termed α-,β-, γ- and δ-group [3], which
in turn could be further subdivided into thirteen subgroups. Like most vertebrates, the Rhodopsin family in
amphioxus contains the largest number of GPCRs (Fig 1).
These GPCRs are found in all four main groups of Rhodopsin GPCRs. However, only eight of the thirteen subgroups are present in amphioxus (See Additional file 1,
figure S6-S16); missing are the mammalian type of olfactory receptors, the chemokine, the melanin concentrating
hormone (MCH), the MAS-related and the purin receptor
subgroup. This is in line with our previous study indicating that MAS-related receptors are missing in teleost fish
and that C. intestinalis is missing four of these five groups
[4]. The fact that C. intestinalis has a chemokine receptor
cluster strengthens the argumentation forwarded by Delsuc et al. that tunicates and not cephalochordates are the
closest living relatives to the vertebrates [10].
One dopamine receptor, AmphiD1/β, has been identified
in amphioxus [27,28]. Recently, 11 receptors related to

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:9

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/9

the large cluster of biogenic amine receptors were identified in amphioxus from unassembled genomic sequence
reads and shown to have tissue specific expression [29].
Our searches from the assembled genome identified additional 33 receptors belonging to the amine receptor cluster. Of the previously known receptors AmphiAmR3 and
R7 cluster with histamine receptor 4 in our phylogenetic
tree, AmphiAmR1 clusters with dopamine receptors D1
and D5, AmphiAmR4, R5, R6, R9 and R11 is found in a
non-resolved cluster with only amphioxus sequences
while we placed AmphiD1/β basal to the amine subgroup
as it could not find a stable location in the tree.
AmphiAmR2, R8 and R10 placed basal in the Rhodopsin
family. Of the new amphioxus receptors we identified, 18
fall in groups containing only amphioxus sequences in
the phylogenetic tree (Additional file 1, figure S6), indicating that they are not clearly orthologous to any of the
mammalian receptors. However, we also identified receptors that fall into specific groups of human receptors, suggesting the possibility that they are sharing ligands with
the orthologous human receptors. We identified receptors
that place in the D2/D3 dopamine cluster, the muscarinic
receptor cluster and the adenosine receptor cluster. Moreover, we found orthologs to three serotonin receptors,
namely 1, 5 and 6 as well as six receptors that place close
to histamine receptor 4 (Additional file 1, figure S6). In
addition to the rich set of amine receptors, amphioxus has
large set of peptide binding receptors and predicted peptide ligands, including several receptors (neuropeptide Y,
neuropeptide FF, uterinbombesin, neuromedin and
growth hormone secretagogues receptors) with ligands
involved in appetite control (see further details in Additional file 4, table S1-S3).

for humans and M. musculus are from [13], G. gallus from [8]
and for the remaining species from [4].

The Rhodopsin family in amphioxus contains several larger
expansions of GPCRs (see Additional file 1, figure S6S16). The largest of these includes the Neuropeptide FF
receptor in the β-group (39 sequences), somatostatin, opioid, galanin cluster (29 sequences), two expansions in the
melanocortin, endothelin cannabinoid clusters with 21
and 24 sequences each and one in the melatonin receptor
cluster (19). The β-group, which has several peptide receptors, also has a large expansion of twenty predicted genes
that are similar to the prokineticin receptor (PK) 1 and 2
which are important for contraction of gastrointestinal
smooth muscles [30]. These are, on average, about 42 percent identical in the TM regions with PK1 and PK2 receptors. This expansion is surprising, however as prokineticin
is a very potent muscle contractor, it is possible that these
receptors are involved in these early specific pre-vertebrate
muscles that create effective undulations of the amphioxus body.
163 amphioxus sequences had more resemblance to
invertebrate sequences than to vertebrate transcripts

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:9

according to the BLAST searches. Beside the expansion in
the Adhesion family, most of these are categorized to the
Rhodopsin family (111) or these are sequences we could
not categorize (28). Still, none of the larger Rhodopsin clusters mentioned above show similarity to many invertebrate like sequences with exception of the melatonin
cluster which shows similarity to several S. purpuratus
genes. There is also a cluster in the β-group of the Rhodopsin family holding seven transcripts that all are insect
like and have all hits related to the ecdysis triggering hormone receptor [31].
We found several examples of support for Ohno's 2R
hypothesis that postulates that two whole genome duplication occurred in early vertebrate evolution [32,33]. The
phylogenetic trees show that there are several branches
with multiple human members where amphioxus
sequences place basal (closer to the root of the tree) on the
branch. For example, the tachykinin receptors 1–3 and
frizzled receptor 1,2 and 7 both cluster with a single
amphioxus sequence with high bootstrap values. These
belong to paralogon groups (PG) 9 (Meta HOX) [34,35]
and 10 (HOX paralogon), respectively. Moreover, the
muscarine receptors 1,3,5 in PG4 have basal amphioxustranscripts as well as adenosin binding receptors 1, 2A, 2B
in PG11, brain specific angiogenesis-inhibitory receptors
1–3 in PG14 and somatostatin receptors 2,3,5 in PG12.

Conclusion
Overall, the amphioxus genome is in general terms surprisingly rich in GPCRs, with extensive representation of
receptors from all of the main mammalian GPCRs families (See Fig 1). The repertoire resembles that of vertebrates but lacks the branches previously known to be
vertebrate-specific. The groups that are missing include
the chemokine receptors which are important for the
immune system and receptors for purines which serve as
important co-transmitters within the nervous systems.
Amphioxus lacks many of the classical mammalian sensory receptors such as the pheromone receptors that are
particularly important for non-primate mammals and
also the mammalian olfactory receptors. Moreover,
amphioxus does not have the bitter taste receptors (TAS2)
or the sweet and umami (TAS1) receptors which suggest
that amphioxus have a unique way of detecting these taste
modalities. The amphioxus genome does not have any
other classical GPCR group that recognizes exogenous
stimuli, such as mammalian type olfactory receptors or
pheromone receptors. On the other hand, amphioxus has
opsin receptors, showing conservation in the visual system. It should however be mentioned that sensory GPCRs
evolve rapidly and there are many species specific expansion of such receptors. It can thus not be excluded that
there are sensory receptors that are not found in this type
of searches. Amphioxus has fewer receptors that clearly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/9

can be recognised as monoamine receptors (only 1 muscarinic, 2 dopamine, 3 serotonin and one histamine)
which are involved in neurotransmission in higher animals. Amphioxus does, however, have a large number of
other receptors with high similarity to amine and peptide
receptors that suggest early development of these systems
that are very important for CNS functions.

Methods
Search & confirmation
The amphioxus genome and protein sequences were
downloaded from US Department of Energy Joint
Genome Institute [11]. Protein transcripts shorter than
250 amino acids were removed as they are too short to
hold a 7TM-region. The remaining amphioxus proteins
were searched with GPCR hmm models adapted from [4]
using hmmer [36], which is available from [37]. All hits
with an E-value below 0.01 were aligned with BLAST [38]
against a database consisting of the human RefSeq [39]
together with nematode chemoreceptors, the gustatory
receptors from insects, the odorant receptors from D. melanogaster, MLO receptors in plants [12], fungal pheromone receptors (STE2 and STE3) from yeast and cAMP
receptors from D. discodieum. For each putative amphioxus GPCR, the top five hits were inspected and if a minimum of four of these were GPCRs, the transcript was
accepted as a GPCR. Alternative splice variants were
removed by aligning the amphioxus proteins to their
genome with BLAT [40]. As the amphioxus genome has
not yet been assembled and only consists of scaffolds this
method does not catch all splice-variants and duplicates.
Categorization
In order to categorize the amphioxus GPCRs, human and
other GPCRs were tagged with their family name. The
human receptors were divided into the GRAFS families
[4], Glutamate (GLU), Rhodopsin (Rhod), Adhesion (ADH),
Frizzled (FZD) and Secretin (SEC). The Taste2 receptors
were separated from Frizzled receptors. In addition, the
Rhodopsin family was split in accordance to [4]. The other
GPCR families used in this step were nematode chemosensory receptors, the gustatory receptors from insects, the
odorant receptors from D. melanogaster, MLO receptors
from plants, fungal pheromone receptors (STE2 and
STE3) from yeast and cAMP receptors from D. discodieum.
The putative amphioxus GPCRs were aligned against a
database consisting of these tagged GPCRs and had to
have at least four of the five best hits from the same family
to be assigned to this family. A multiple alignment was
made for each family and the alignments were viewed in
Jalview [41], and the amphioxus sequences were cut with
the reference transcripts as a model to gain only the 7TM
regions. This process was repeated three times in order to
only remove sections in inverse proportion to how well
they aligned, balanced against the alignment quality. First,

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:9

the N and C terminals were removed, except for about
twenty amino acids in each end. Second, internal loops
were removed and in the last round N and C terminals
were trimmed to exactly match the models. In order to
remove duplicate sequences, all the cut amphioxus
sequences were aligned against each other, using BLAT,
and all pairs with identical sequences were removed. Maximum-likelihood trees were also created with PHYLIP and
viewed in MEGA [42]. All sequences in a family were
aligned to each other and an identity distance matrix was
constructed using Megalign from the DNASTAR package
(DNASTAR, Madison, Wisconsin, United States). Amphioxus sequences with identities below ten percent towards
their reference were discarded as random hits. If the identity was between ten and twenty, they were considered
basal to the family. We calculated a neighbor-joining tree,
bootstrapped five hundred times, using MEGA with
default parameters based on an alignment made in MEGA
using the ClustalW algorithm and batch ClustalW default
parameters for the sequences with identities above twenty
percent to at least one of the reference sequences.
Sequences disrupting the tree were moved to the basal
group on the basis of low bootstrap values and poor alignments through manual inspection. Additional identity
checks were made with the EMBOSS [43] implementation
of the Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithm.
Domain search was performed with the PFAM domain
dataset and the HMMER package.
