Abstract
Background: Resolving the evolutionary relationships among Fungi remains challenging because
of their highly variable evolutionary rates, and lack of a close phylogenetic outgroup. Nucleariida,
an enigmatic group of amoeboids, have been proposed to emerge close to the fungal-metazoan
divergence and might fulfill this role. Yet, published phylogenies with up to five genes are without
compelling statistical support, and genome-level data should be used to resolve this question with
confidence.
Results: Our analyses with nuclear (118 proteins) and mitochondrial (13 proteins) data now
robustly associate Nucleariida and Fungi as neighbors, an assemblage that we term 'Holomycota'.
With Nucleariida as an outgroup, we revisit unresolved deep fungal relationships.
Conclusion: Our phylogenomic analysis provides significant support for the paraphyly of the
traditional taxon Zygomycota, and contradicts a recent proposal to include Mortierella in a phylum
Mucoromycotina. We further question the introduction of separate phyla for Glomeromycota and
Blastocladiomycota, whose phylogenetic positions relative to other phyla remain unresolved even
with genome-level datasets. Our results motivate broad sampling of additional genome sequences
from these phyla.

Background
The investigation of previously little known eukaryotic
lineages within and close to the opisthokonts will be key
to understanding the origins of Fungi, the evolution of
developmental traits in Fungi and Metazoa, and ulti-

mately the origin(s) of multicellularity [1-3]. In particular,
it will help to establish which and how many developmental genes are either shared or specific to these two
major eukaryotic groups. In this context, it is essential to
determine the precise phylogenetic position of candidate

protists that are close to Fungi, Metazoa, or opisthokonts
as a whole.
The candidate organisms choanoflagellates, ichthyosporeans and Ministeria have been convincingly shown to be
relatives of Metazoa (combined in a taxon termed Holozoa; [4]) by using molecular phylogenetics with genomic
datasets (e.g., [4-8]). Yet, there are remaining questions
about the exact phylogenetic positions of Capsaspora [5,8]
and Ministeria [7] within Holozoa. Another, less well studied group of protists are Nucleariida, a group of heterotrophic amoeboids with radiating filopodia. Nucleariids
lack distinctive morphological features that might allow
associating them with either animals or fungi. Their mitochondrial cristae are either discoidal-shaped or flattened
[9-11]. Indeed, initial phylogenetic analyses based on single genes have been inconsistent in placing them even
within opisthokonts. There has been also confusion due
to the inclusion within Nucleariida of Capsaspora owczarzaki, a species that is now excluded from this group and
shown to be clearly associated with Holozoa [5,11-17].
Overall, the phylogenetic position of the 'true' nucleariids
remains controversial. In a more recent phylogenetic
investigation with four nuclear gene sequences (EF-1α,
HSP70, actin and β-tubulin), nucleariids associate confidently with Fungi, but only when selecting two slowevolving chytridiomycetes [18]. When improving the
taxon sampling to 18 fungal species, the bootstrap support (BS) value for fungal monophyly drops to 85%, and
alternative nucleariid positions are not rejected with the
approximately unbiased (AU) test [18,19]. In this context,
it seems noteworthy that Nuclearia and fungi other than
chytrids are fast-evolving, and that the rate of tubulin evolution varies strongly among species of the latter dataset
(correlating to some degree with the independent loss of
the flagellar apparatus in non-chytrid fungi and in Nuclearia). Together, these rate differences at the gene and species levels may increase long-branch-attraction (LBA
between the two fast-evolving groups) thus causing
weaker support for fungal monophyly and the nucleariidfungal sister relationship, or predicting altogether incorrect phylogenetic relationships.
These unresolved questions served as motivation for the
current phylogenetic analyses that are based on broad
taxon sampling, substantially more nuclear genes (available through expressed sequence tag (EST) or complete
genome projects), and comparative analyses of nuclear
and mitochondrial gene datasets. To this end, we
sequenced several thousand ESTs each from two Nuclearia
simplex strains (probably representing separate species
based on the high level of sequence divergence between
them), and added them to a previous dataset [20] along
with new genome data available from Holozoa (C. owc-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/272

zarzaki, Amoebidium parasiticum, Sphaeroforma arctica; [5])
and Fungi (Allomyces macrogynus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, and Mortierella verticillata). We then sequenced the
mitochondrial genome of one of the two N. simplex
strains. Similar to the nuclear genomes of fungi, their
mitochondrial genomes also evolve at varying rates
thereby introducing a considerable potential for phylogenetic artifacts. However, phylogenetic comparisons
between mitochondrial and nuclear data provide valuable, cross-wise indicators of phylogenetic artifacts as the
respective evolutionary rates differ between the two
genomes. For instance, such comparisons have revealed
inconsistencies for the positioning of Schizosaccharomyces
species within Taphrinomycotina [21], and of Capsaspora
within Holozoa [5,7,8].
If the nucleariids are indeed the closest known relatives of
Fungi as claimed [18], this protist group will provide an
excellent fungal outgroup that would ultimately facilitate
the settling of controversial phylogenetic placement of
taxa within Fungi and/or in close neighboring groups.
Among the debated issues are the monophyly and appropriate classification of the traditional fungal taxa Chytridiomycota and Zygomycota. Previous analyses based on
single or a few genes have been inconsistent in answering
these questions, and often lack significant support [2231]. For example, the analyses of ribosomal RNA data
supports the sister relationship between Glomeromycota
and Dikarya (Ascomycota plus Basidiomycota) [29],
while analysis of genes encoding the largest and secondlargest subunits of the nuclear RNA polymerase II supports the monophyly of Zygomycota in its traditional definition [25].
Phylogenetic positioning of the extremely fast-evolving
Microsporidia (causing strong LBA artifacts in phylogenetic analyses) is another controversial issue of great interest. In some of the most recent analyses, Microsporidia
have been placed either close to zygomycetes/Mucorales
[32,33], or together with Rozella allomycis [24]. Together
with environmental sequences, Rozella species form part
of a large, diverse and relatively slowly evolving lineage
(designated "Rozellida"). They branch as a sister clade to
Fungi [24,34], which raises the additional question
whether they should be considered to be true fungi as
originally proposed [35]. Testing the above alternative
hypotheses on microsporidian affinities by phylogenomic
analysis will require much more data from Rozellida (a
few genes are known from Rozella allomycis, but largely
insufficient for inclusion in our analyses), and from a
much wider range of the paraphyletic zygomycetes. Generation of genome-size data will be further critical for
applying methods that reduce LBA artifacts such as
removal of fast-evolving genes or sequence sites (e.g., [36]
and references therein).

Despite these and various other unresolved phylogenetic
issues, fungal taxonomy has been substantially redefined
in a recent proposal [28]. Chytridiomycota is still treated
as a phylum, but now include only Chytridiomycetes and
Monoblepharidomycetes. Other traditional chytrid lineages such as Blastocladiomycota and Neocallimastigales
have been elevated to phyla based on the analyses of LSU
and SSU rRNA [23], although support with these and
other molecular markers is inconclusive. In turn, the traditional phylum Zygomycota has been altogether
removed from this taxonomy [28], because evolutionary
relationships among its members are currently unresolved
and suspected to be paraphyletic. Zygomycota are now
reassigned into a phylum Glomeromycota plus four subphyla incertae sedis (i.e., uncertain): Mucoromycotina,
Kickxellomycotina, Zoopagomycotina and Entomophthoromycotina. To revisit these somewhat contentious
issues, we compared results with mitochondrial and
nuclear phylogenomic datasets, and further analyzed the
effect of extending fungal species sampling, with the two
N. simplex strains as the outgroup.

Results and Discussion
Phylogenomic analysis with the Eukaryotic Dataset
supports Nucleariida as sister to Fungi
Phylogenomic analysis of the Eukaryotic Dataset with one
of the currently most realistic phylogenetic models (category mixture model (CAT); [37]) confirms the monophyly of major eukaryotic groups including Holozoa,
Fungi, Amoebozoa, and Viridiplantae. Further, Amoebidium, Sphaeroforma plus Capsaspora form a monophyletic
group, and Nuclearia is without a doubt the closest known
sister-group to Fungi (100% BS; Figure 1). Also some
higher-order relationships are recovered with significant
support, such as opisthokonts and the two recently proposed supergroups JEH (jakobids, Euglenozoa plus Heterolobosea [20]) and CAS (Cercozoa, Alveolata plus
Stramenopila [20,38,39]), whereas monophyly of Plantae, Excavata and Chromalveolata is not found. Evidently,
the taxon sampling of protists in our dataset is insufficient
for (and not aimed at) resolving the phylogenetic relationships among these latter lineages, as it was meant to
constitute only a strong and well sampled outgroup to
opisthokonts.

Analysis of the Eukaryotic Dataset with maximum likelihood (ML) using RAxML [40] and the commonly used
WAG+Γ model generated a similar tree topology (Figure 1
and additional file 1). Deep opisthokont divergences are
predicted consistently and with significant support (BS >
98%), with Nuclearia clearly sister to Fungi (100% BS)
and choanoflagellates the closest neighbor of animals.
Amoebidium, Sphaeroforma plus Capsaspora form a monophyletic sister group to animals plus choanoflagellates,
consistent with a previous analysis [5] but contradicting

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/272

others [7,8]. The reasons for this incongruence may be
related to differences in data and taxon sampling. Our
dataset contains 50 eukaryotic species with a close outgroup to Holozoa (i.e., including nucleariids together
with fungal representatives), compared with a total of
only 30 species in a more extensive previous analysis [7].
In contrast to our analysis using Bayesian inference (BI),
ML associates Malawimonadozoa with JEH (77% BS), a
tendency noted and discussed previously [20,41], and an
issue to be addressed by better taxon sampling in this
group (currently, data are available from only two species). Other minor differences between WAG versus CAT
model analyses (yet without statistical support in favor of
alternatives) are in relationships within Plantae and the
placement of Haptophyceae.
We further investigated if the position of Nuclearia next to
Fungi might be affected by potential phylogenetic artifacts, such as compositional sequence bias and/or LBA
[36,42]. This is suspected because of the highly varying
evolutionary rates both within Fungi and in protist outgroups, and the unusual result that better taxon sampling
in Fungi reduces phylogenetic support for the Nuclearia
position ([18]; see introduction). To do so, we first eliminated fast-evolving species from the dataset: S. cerevisiae,
Blastocystis hominis, Cryptosporidium parvum, Sterkiella histriomuscorum, Diplonema papillatum and Leishmania major.
The results from analyses using RAxML were essentially
unchanged, both with respect to tree topology and BS values (additional file 2). To counteract sequence bias, we
recoded the 20 amino acids into six groups as previously
proposed [43]. Again, phylogenetic analysis of this dataset
using P4 [44] generated essentially the same tree topology, with some support values decreased due to loss of
information by recoding (additional file 3).
Finally, we evaluated the positioning of Nuclearia next to
Fungi with the AU and weighted Shimodeira Hasegawa
(wSH) likelihood tests [45]. For this, we compared the
topology presented in Figure 1 with competing tree topologies in which the two Nuclearia strains were moved as sistergroup to all major eukaryotic lineages, and all possible
positions within Opisthokonta. The results of both tests
confirm Nuclearia as the closest neighbor group of Fungi,
with all alternative topologies rejected at a significance
level of p = 0.002 (Table 1). Given the unequivocal support for Nuclearia as the fungal sistergroup, we propose
the term 'Holomycota' to refer to the assemblage of Nucleariida plus Fungi.
Mitochondrial phylogeny and genomic features support
monophyly of the Holomycota
Phylogenetic analyses of nuclear versus mitochondrial
datasets are expected to come to similar conclusions, thus
providing independent evidence for the given phyloge-

Tree of eukaryotes based on Eukaryotic Dataset. Trees were inferred with PhyloBayes and rooted following a previous

probability values using PhyloBayes are 1.0 for all except two branches (0.98 for the branch uniting Viridiplantae and Haptophyceae; 0.90 for the clade indicted by *). The analyses using ML (RAxML, WAG+Gamma; four categories, see additional file 1)

netic relationships. To this end, we sequenced and analyzed the complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of one
of the N. simplex strains (a circular mapping DNA of 74
120 bp; see additional file 4). Note that growth of Nuclearia is complicated (the standard method calls for growth
on Petri dishes with a bacterial lawn as food source), and
that it is difficult to obtain sufficient cell material for
mtDNA purification, explaining why we succeeded for
only one of the two Nuclearia species.
The Nuclearia mtDNA contains a high number of introns
(21 group I, and one group II), and mitochondrial protein
genes appear to be translated with the standard translation code. These features are also widespread in Fungi. In

contrast, Holozoa all use a mitochondrial UGA (tryptophan) codon reassignment, and contain no or only a
few introns (with the notable exception of Placozoa, an
enigmatic group of Metazoa [46]).
Phylogenetic analysis of a dataset with 56 species and 13
of the ubiquitous, most conserved mtDNA-encoded proteins predicts the monophyly of Opisthokonta, Stramenopila, Holozoa and Fungi with confidence, and also
recovers Nuclearia as the sister-group of Fungi, albeit with
a moderate BS value of 85% (Figure 2). To verify if the
limited support for Holomycota is expected (i.e., correlating with the number of available sequence positions in
the respective datasets), we performed a variable length

bootstrap (VLB) analysis. It compares the development of
BS values with the number of sequence positions, for the
nucleariid/fungal sister relationship. For this, we chose
the 29 species shared between the two datasets (for the
tree topology of the respective nuclear dataset see additional file 5). The results show that the development of BS
values is similar for nuclear and mitochondrial data (Figure 3), and that the available mitochondrial dataset (as
well as the above-cited nuclear phylogenies with five
genes) is too small to resolve the phylogenetic position of
nucleariids with high confidence. A better taxon sampling
primarily in nucleariids will be imperative for improved
phylogenetic resolution, motivating sequencing projects
with new technologies, which are likely to provide mitochondrial as well as nuclear genome sequences - even with
the limited amount of cellular material that is available
for some taxa (e.g., [47]).
Fungal phylogeny with Nucleariida as outgroup
Analyses of both the nuclear and mitochondrial datasets
have been insufficient to assess with confidence, neither
zygomycete mono/paraphyly, nor the phylogenetic position of Blastocladiomycota (Blastocladiales) (Figure 1, 2).
For instance, a recent mitochondrial multi-gene phylogeny with the first complete Glomus mtDNA sequence
groups Glomus and Mortierella, yet lacks significant statistical support [47]. To re-address these questions, we have
assembled a large dataset of nuclear-encoded genes from
an extended, representative selection of fungal species,
plus the two Nuclearia species as outgroup (i.e., the Fungal
Dataset). The analyses show overall strong BS for the paraphyly of zygomycetes (Figure 4), i.e., the Entomophthoromycotina represent a significantly supported and
completely independent fungal lineage. However, monophyletic Mucoromycotina including Mortierella as recently
redefined [28] is not recovered (rendering the taxon

Mucoromycotina paraphyletic), neither is the taxon Symbiomycota (Glomeromycota plus Dikarya; [29]). Instead,
there is moderate support to group Mucorales plus
Dikarya (92% BS in BI) and Glomus as their next neighbor
(85% BS in BI). Although the placement of Glomus relative
to Mortierella differs between our BI and ML analyses (Figure 4), we assume that the result of the BI analysis with its
superior evolutionary model is more reliable. In light of
these results, taxonomic reordering based on stable phylogenetic resolution of the traditional zygomycetes will
require phylogenomic analyses with a much improved
taxon sampling. Currently, nuclear and mitochondrial
genome data are available only for single species in the
latter two taxa; i.e. Glomus intraradices and M. verticillata.
Rooting of the fungal tree with nucleariids confirms that
the traditional chytridiomycetes are also paraphyletic,
again assuming that the result of the BI analysis is correct
(Figure 4). Confirmation of this result (justifying an elevation of Blastocladiomycota as a separate phylum; [28]) is
highly desirable, as genome-size datasets in Blastocladiomycota are limited to the two moderately distant species
Blastocladiella emersonii and A. macrogynus. Similarly, in
light of the significant support for a monophyletic
Chytridiomycota plus Neocallimastigomycota (100% BS
with BI; Figure 4), their division into separate taxonomic
higher ranks should be reconsidered, but only after phylogenomic analysis with improved taxon sampling in both
groups. Finally, our results motivate genome or EST
sequencing in Rozella species (Rozellida), potential relatives of Microsporidia and close neighbors of Fungi. The
availability of a largely improved taxon sampling in zygomycetes, chytrids and Rozellida will provide a solid basis
for evaluating the proposed placements of Microsporidia
- either within or as a sistergroup to Fungi - based on phylogenomic analyses.

Figure 2
Phylogeny inferred from the mitochondrial dataset
Phylogeny inferred from the mitochondrial dataset. For details on figure description, evolutionary models and phylogenetic methods, see legend of Figure 1. Note that as already noted in a previous publication [5], the phylogenetic position of
Capsaspora with mitochondrial data differs from that with nuclear data (Figure 1). We attribute this inconsistency to the limited
availability of mtDNA sequences from Capsaspora relatives, and a strong LBA artifact introduced by the fast-evolving Bilateria in
concert with Trichoplax. Further, the placements of Cryptococcus and Ustilago differ (although without significant support) from
those with nuclear data (see Figure 4), although results with the much larger nuclear dataset are more likely to be correct.
The results presented here are consistent with previous
notions on how Fungi came into being. For example it is
thought that the first Fungi probably had branched
chytrid-like rhizoids, which developed by enclosure of
nucleariid-like filopodia (sometimes branched) into cell
walls, during a nutritional shift from phagotrophy to
saprotrophy, thus giving rise to fungal hyphae and rhizoids [7]. However, the picture is more complicated as it is
widely thought that the ancestral opisthokont also had a
single posterior flagellum [48]. This structure was lost during evolution of most but not all fungal lineages (e.g.,
[9,25,49,50]), with a separate loss in the nucleariid sistergroup. In this sense, nucleariids are unlikely to represent a
primitive developmental stage, but rather a secondary
reduction resulting in a unicellular, amoeboid life style.
Obviously, the clarification of the chain of events leading
to the emergence of multicellularity in Fungi is by no
means complete. These issues will only become clear with

a much broader sampling of genomes from taxa near the
animal-fungal divergence and the discovery of additional
protist groups that are closely related to Fungi.

Conclusion
Here we demonstrate that phylogenomic analysis with
improved evolutionary models and algorithms has a
potential for resolving long-standing issues in fungal evolution, by increasing phylogenetic resolution. Yet, while
our results support certain aspects of the new taxonomic
classification of Fungi they contradict others, suggesting
that the introduction of certain higher-level taxa is only
preliminary. In particular, the elevation of Neocallimastigales, Blastocladiomycota and Glomeromycota to separate phyla is questionable from a molecular phylogenetics
standpoint, and potentially confusing to the larger scientific community. At present, genome analyses continue to
suffer from poor sampling in chytrids, zygomycetes and

close fungal relatives such as nucleariids. This issue will be
resolved by the employment of new, increasingly inexpensive genome sequencing technologies. Phylogenomic
projects like the current one will help focusing on genome
analyses of poorly known phyla and taxa that are key to
understanding fungal origins and evolution.

Methods
Construction of cDNA libraries and EST sequencing
Two N. simplex (CCAP 1552/2 and 1552/4) cDNA libraries were constructed following recently published protocols [51]. Cells were grown in liquid standing cultures in
WCL medium http://megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/People/
lang/FMGP/methods/wcl.html supplemented with 0.5 ×
Cerophyll, with E. coli cells as food, which were pre-grown
on LB medium in Petri-dishes as food. Plasmids were
purified using the QIAprep 96 Turbo Miniprep Kit (Qiagen), sequencing reactions were performed with the ABI
Prism BigDye™ terminator version 3.0/3.1 (Perkin-Elmer,
Wellesley, MA, USA) and sequenced on an MJ BaseStation
(MJ Research, USA). Trace files were imported into the
TBestDB database http://tbestdb.bcm.umontreal.ca/

searches/login.php[52] for automated processing, including assembly as well as automated gene annotation by
AutoFact [53,54].
Mitochondrial sequencing and genome annotation
N. simplex (CCAP 1552/2) was grown as described above.
The harvested cells were disrupted by addition of SDS plus
proteinase K, and mitochondrial DNA was purified following a whole cell lysate protocol [55] and sequenced
from a random clone library [56]. For mitochondrial
genome assembly we used Phred, Phrap and Consed
[57,58]; http://www.phrap.org/. Mitochondrial genes and
introns were identified using automated procedures
(MFannot, N. Beck and BFL unpublished; RNAweasel,
[59]), followed by manual curation of the results.
Dataset construction
A previously published alignment of nuclear-encoded
proteins [20] was used for adding the new Nuclearia cDNA
sequences generated in our lab, plus extra sequences available from GenBank (a taxonomic broad dataset containing 50 eukaryotes will be referred to as the 'Eukaryotic

Dataset'; another one containing 26 fungal species plus
the two Nuclearia species as 'Fungal Dataset') using MUST
[60] and FORTY (Denis Baurain and HP, unpublished).
The number of species has been limited (to allow phylogenomic analyses within reasonable time frames), but only
in well-sampled phylogenetic groups of undisputed phylogenetic affinity. Species that were not included are either
fast-evolving and/or are incompletely sequenced. Other
procedures for dataset construction, in particular the elimination of paralogous proteins, have been described previously [61]. Within opisthokonts, major lineages had to
be represented by at least two distant species, and the
extremely fast-evolving Microsporidia were excluded, as
these are known to introduce phylogenetic artifacts and
an overall reduction of phylogenetic resolution (at an
extreme leading to misplacement of species; e.g., [62,63]).
Sampling within the protist outgroup of the Eukaryotic
Dataset is also not comprehensive (Stramenopila, Alveolata, and Euglenozoa) and limited to slow-evolving representatives of major eukaryotic lineages. The final
Eukaryotic Dataset contains 118 proteins (24 439 amino
acid positions) and the Fungal Dataset 150 proteins (40

925 amino acid positions). Proteins included in the
nuclear datasets are listed in additional file 6.
For a dataset of mitochondrial proteins, 13 ubiquitous
genes (cox1, 2, 3, cob, atp6, 9, and nad1, 2, 3, 4, 4L, 5, 6)
were selected. Muscle ([64]), Gblocks ([65]) and an application developed in-house (mams) were used for automatic protein alignment, removal of ambiguous regions
and concatenation. The final dataset contains 56 taxa and
2 710 amino acid positions.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analyses were performed at the amino acid
(aa) level using methods that are known to be least sensitive to LBA artifacts ([36,37,66], and references therein).
The concatenated protein datasets were analyzed either by
Bayesian inference (BI, PhyloBayes [37]) with the CAT+ Γ
model and four discrete gamma categories, or by maximum likelihood (ML, RAxML [40] with the WAG+ Γ
model and four discrete categories. BI analyses using the
CAT model have been shown to be more reliable than ML,

model. ML analyses were essentially performed to identify
differences in topology, pinpointing problematic parts of
the tree for which addition of new data would be in order
(i.e., preferentially genome sequences from slowly-evolving species, and those that are expected to break long
internal branches at questionable tree topologies).
In case of BI and the Eukaryotic Dataset (values for the
Fungal Dataset in brackets), chains were run for 3000
(1000) cycles, and the first 1500 (500) cycles were
removed as burn-in corresponding to approximately
1,200,000 (400,000) generations. Convergence was controlled by running three independent chains, resulting in
identical topologies. The reliability of internal branches
for both, ML and BI analyses was evaluated based on 100
bootstrap replicates. For BI, we inferred a consensus tree
from the posterior tree topologies of replicates.
Likelihood tests of competing tree topologies were also
performed. The site-wise likelihood values were estimated
using Tree-Puzzle [67] with the WAG+ Γ model, and pvalues for each topology were calculated with CONSEL
[45].
Variable Length Bootstrap analysis
We compared the performance of nuclear and mitochondrial datasets in phylogenetic inference by Variable Length
Bootstrap (VLB) analysis [68]. Sequences of 29 common
species were taken from the eukaryotic (24,439 aa positions) and mitochondrial (2,710 aa positions) datasets.
From these, two respective series of sub-datasets were constructed by randomly choosing 400, 600, 800, 1 000 ...
sequence positions. Phylogenetic inferences were then
performed using RAxML with the WAG+Γ model and four
discrete categories, after which the BS values for the grouping of nucleariids and Fungi were recorded.

Authors' contributions
ETS and LF constructed and sequenced the two Nuclearia
EST libraries; YL, HB, HP and BFL conducted phylogenetic
analyses. All authors participated in writing, reading and
approving the manuscript.

Phylogeny with Eukaryotic Dataset after recoding amino acids into six
groups. The amino acids of the Eukaryotic Dataset were recoded into six
groups as follows: (1) ASTGP, (2) DNEQ, (3) RKH, (4) MVIL, (5)
FYW and, (6) C. This allowed the use of a 6 × 6 general time-reversible
rate matrix with free parameters rather than a fixed empirical matrix.
Sequence composition and among-site rate variation parameters were also
free in the BI analysis, as implemented in P4 (Foster PG: Modeling compositional heterogeneity. Syst Biol 2004, 53(3):485-495); 50 000 generations, first 10 000 removed as burn-in). Numbers at branches
represent PP values.

Phylogenetic relationship of the 29 species used for VLB analyses. The
phylogeny was inferred using nuclear data and RAxML with the WAG +
Gamma model. In order to minimize missing data in the mitochondrial
dataset, we exchanged Saccharomyces and Schizosaccharomyces that
both lost the six mitochondrion-encoded nad genes with Candida albicans and Taphrina.
