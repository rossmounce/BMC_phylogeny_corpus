Abstract
Background: Subtribe Artemisiinae of Tribe Anthemideae (Asteraceae) is composed of 18 largely
Asian genera that include the sagebrushes and mugworts. The subtribe includes the large
cosmopolitan, wind-pollinated genus Artemisia, as well as several smaller genera and Seriphidium,
that altogether comprise the Artemisia-group. Circumscription and taxonomic boundaries of
Artemisia and the placements of these small segregate genera is currently unresolved.
Results: We constructed a molecular phylogeny for the subtribe using the internal transcribed
spacers (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA analyzed with parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian criteria.
The resulting tree is comprised of three major clades that correspond to the radiate genera (e.g.,
Arctanthemum and Dendranthema), and two clades of Artemisia species. All three clades have allied
and segregate genera embedded within each.
Conclusions: The data support a broad concept of Artemisia s.l. that includes Neopallasia,
Crossostephium, Filifolium, Seriphidium, and Sphaeromeria. However, the phylogeny excludes
Elachanthemum, Kaschgaria, and Stilnolepis from the Artemisia-group. Additionally, the monophyly of
the four subgenera of Artemisia is also not supported, with the exception of subg. Dracunculus.
Homogamous, discoid capitula appear to have arisen in parallel four to seven times, with the loss
of ray florets. Thus capitular morphology is not a reliable taxonomic character, which traditionally
has been one of the defining characters.

Background
Artemisia L. (Asteraceae), as broadly conceived by Linnaeus, is the largest genus in Tribe Anthemideae [1–3] and
one of the largest in the family [4]. It is widespread in mid-

to high-latitudes, and shrubby species dominate most
cold and many warm deserts in the Northern Hemisphere
[5–13]. Because of the abundance of wind-dispersed Artemisia pollen in the geological column, it is used as an in-

dicator of steppe climates [14]. Some members are
foraged by ungulates, rodents, birds, and insects [11,15–
19], despite the production of sesquiterpenes that afford a
bitter taste to the herbage. The woody species increase dramatically under grazing pressure, thereby excluding desirable forage [11,20,21]. Many Artemisia species are a major
cause of allergies in humans [22]. All Artemisia species
produce aromatic oils, and several are culinary herbs or
used as flavorings, hallucinogens, vermifuges, and pharmaceuticals [23–26], and some are toxic [27]. Artemisia
annua (annual wormwood) and A. mexicana produce antimalarial drugs [28–30], and artemisinin (from A. annua)
appears to selectively kill human breast cancer cells [31].
Despite the well-known importance of Artemisia, there is
no consensus on taxonomic relationships, which have traditionally been inferred on the basis of floral and capitular morphology. In Artemisia s.l., the typical limb of the
Anthemideae-type ray florets are reduced to a membranous vestige, giving the impression that the small capitula
are composed only of disk florets, referred to as disciform
capitula (inflorescence) by Bremer and Humphries [2]. In
other members of the genus, the ray flowers are absent,
thus the capitulum is composed only of disk florets, i.e.,
discoid. In addition, plants with discoid capitula are considered homogamous since all florets are of one sexual
form (perfect-bisexual disk florets), and plants with disciform capitula are considered heterogamous with two or
more sexual forms (i.e., pistillate rays and perfect disks, or
pistillate rays and staminate disks).
Taxonomic treatments for Artemisia over the past 50 years
range from maintaining a single, large genus of over 500
species [32–37] to the recognition of six to eight genera
from within its taxonomic boundaries [2,38,39]. Artemisia
of antiquity was divided into three genera (Artemisia, Absinthium, and Abrotanum) by Tournefort [40]. However,
the concept of a more inclusive genus was resurrected by
Linnaeus [41], hereinafter, referred to as Artemisia s.l. Besser [42] and de Candolle [43] recognized four sections
within Artemisia s.l. primarily based on the presence or absence of ray florets and the fertility/sterility of disk florets:
(1) Abrotanum Besser (Artemisia of later authors) – ray florets pistillate and fertile; disk florets perfect and fertile; receptacle glabrous; (2) Absinthium (Mill.) DC – ray florets
pistillate and fertile; disk florets perfect and fertile; receptacle hairy; (3) Seriphidium (Besser) Besser – ray florets absent; disk florets perfect and fertile; receptacle glabrous;
and (4) Dracunculus Besser – ray florets pistillate and fertile; disk florets functionally staminate; receptacle glabrous.
The first phylogenetic treatment [44] recognized four sections within a broadly defined Artemisia s.l. with sect. Artemisia proposed as the progenitor to sect. Absinthium,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/2/17

Dracunculus, and Seriphidium. This phylogeny was based
on two hypothesized evolutionary trends: loss of fertility
in the disk florets and loss of ray florets. Sect. Artemisia
and Absinthium were later united [45] and all sections
were raised to the level of subgenus [46,47], i.e., subg. Artemisia, Dracunculus, and Seriphidium. In addition, a
number of authors [20,21,34,35,47,48] considered the
American woody sagebrushes to have an independent origin from the woody Asian species (subg. Seriphidium),
and recognized sect. Tridentatae.
Poljakov [38] and others [2] segregated subg. Seriphidium
as a distinct genus along with several small genera from
within the boundaries of Artemisia s.l. The more recent,
major classifications [2,39,49,50] have agreed with the
segregation of Seriphidium on the basis of discoid-homogamous capitula and recognized the smaller segregate genera as well. Ling [39,51,52], for instance, considered
Artemisia s.s. and Seriphidium to be distinct and sister to
each other, and with the small segregate and allied genera
in turn sister to them [53]. In their landmark monograph
of Tribe Anthemideae, Bremer and Humphries [2] placed
Artemisia and its allied genera in Subtribe Artemisiinae. In
contrast to Ling's hypothesis [53] regarding sister group
relationships between Artemisia s.s. and Seriphidium, the
Bremer and Humphries [2] morphologically based cladogram placed four small genera (Neopallasia, Turaniphytum,
Mausolea, Picrothamnus; with a total of seven species) as
closest sisters (i.e., segregates) of Artemisia s.s. (the Artemisia-clade sensu Bremer and Humphries), whereas Seriphidium and two small genera (Kaschgaria, Crossostephium; 3
species total) were placed outside the Artemisia-clade as allies to Artemisia s.s. In addition, Sphaeromeria, Filifolium,
Ajaniopsis, and Stilnolepis (13 species total) were sister to
this clade of eight genera that included Artemisia s.s. and
its segregates and allies. Further, Ling and Ling [54] recognized Elachanthemum as distinct from Stilnolepis, i.e., as
two monotypic genera. Altogether these 12–13 genera
comprise the Artemisia-group sensu Bremer and Humphries.
According to Bremer and Humphries [2], the Artemisiagroup is monophyletic and defined by heterogamous-disciform capitula (disk florets usually bisexual and fertile,
ray florets pistillate) or homogamous-discoid capitula
(disk florets usually bisexual and fertile, ray florets absent), pollen with short or no spines (associated with anemophily), and thick-walled cypselas devoid of ribs
(sometimes faint ribs are present in Sphaeromeria and
Crossostephium). All of the Artemisia-group genera contain
species that have been variously placed within the taxonomic boundaries of Artemisia s.l. with the exceptions of
Sphaeromeria, Neopallasia, Turaniphytum, and Mausolea.
Nonetheless, these four genera are always considered
closely related to it [2,33,37,38,55]. Artemisia s.s. and

Seriphidium are composed of approximately 380 and 140
species, respectively, and are geographically widespread.
Their species occur predominantly throughout Europe
and temperate Asia, as well as in western North America.
Sphaeromeria and Picrothamnus are endemic to western
North America, whereas all remaining Artemisiinae genera occur in eastern, southwestern, or central Asia.
Several biological factors may account for the disagreement and wide range of interpretation in relation to generic circumscription and subgeneric boundaries in
Artemisia and its allies, including rapid and recent diversification, reduction in floral features (associated with anemophily) with the concomitant loss of potentially useful
taxonomic characters, multiple origins of woodiness
[34,35,56], and chromosomal evolution and hybridization [57–60]. In addition, most studies have focused on a
limited geographic region, rather than studying the taxon
worldwide.
The primary objective of this study is to construct a molecular phylogeny of Subtribe Artemisiinae, including Artemisia and its allies, employing the internal transcribed
spacers (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal (nr) DNA. The goals
are (1) to test the monophyly of Subtribe Artemisiinae
and the Artemisia-group; (2) determine the phylogenetic
placements of the segregate and allied genera in relation
to Artemisia s.s.; and (3) evaluate the patterns of diversification and test biogeographic hypotheses and evolutionary trends in capitular and floral morphology in the
Artemisia-group [49,50]. The ITS have been demonstrated
to be appropriate for examining generic relationships in
many plant families including the Asteraceae [61], for
Tribe Anthemideae specifically [62,63] and within Artemisia [34,36].

Results
The PCR products of the ITS were resolved as single bands
on 1.0% agarose gels. Of the 520 aligned nucleotide positions for both spacers combined (excluding gaps required
for alignment), 213 were phylogenetically informative.
Sequence divergence (uncorrected "p") is 4–6% among
members of the Artemisia-clade, 4–10% among members
of Subtribe Artemisiinae, and 7–17% between Subtribe
Artemisiinae and the outgroup species from other Anthemideae subtribes.
Resulting phylogenetic trees obtained by maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian
analyses were congruent in topology. All three analyses resolved three major clades for Subtribe Artemisiinae, with
MP the least resolved and ML the most highly resolved.
The topologies differed in the placement of Stilnolepis,
which was placed outside of Subtribe Artemisiinae by MP
and at the base of the subtribe by both ML and Bayes. Oth-

erwise, the tree topologies differed only in their ability to
resolve relationships within the three major clades (numbered 1, 2, 3 in Fig. 1).
Using MP, two analyses (10 replicates with TBR branch
swapping on 5000 trees per replicate and 100 replicates
with TBR branch swapping on 1000 trees per replicate) resulted in 30,000 equally parsimonious trees of 1056 steps
(CI = 0.339, RI = 0.707, RC = 0.240). The resulting consensus trees from each MP analysis are identical in topology, with little resolution achieved (trees not shown).
Three major clades of Subtribe Artemisiinae were resolved
and include: 1) species of all Artemisia subgenera except
subg. Drancuculus, as well as Seriphidium, Crossostephium,
Neopallasia, and Sphaeromeria; 2) Filifolium and species of
Artemisia subg. Dracunculus; and 3) Ajania, Arctanthemum,
Dendranthema, and Elachanthemum. Kaschgaria is placed
within the Subtribe Artemisiinae clade, but its position is
unresolved, while Stilpnolepis is placed outside the subtribe. The closest sister genera to Subtribe Artemisiinae are
Nipponanthemum and Leucanthemella (Subtribe Leucantheminae). Three genera (Oncosiphon, Eriocephalus, and
Microcephala) from Subtribe Matricariinae are sister to this
larger clade. Bootstrap analysis supported 17 ingroup
nodes for the MP tree at values >50%, and are indicated
on the ML tree (Fig. 1).
The ML analysis converged upon a single tree with a log
likelihood value of -6970.3335. Likelihood parameters
for the dataset were determined by Modeltest 3.06 for the
TrN+G model, and included the following: base frequencies of A = 0.2482, C = 0.207, G = 0.2466, T = 0.2982; rmatrix values of A-C = 1.0000, A-G = 3.1857, A-T =
1.0000, C-G = 1.0000, C-T = 5.1655, G-T = 1.0000; and a
gamma distribution of 0.5663. The ML tree resolved Subtribe Artemisiinae as monophyletic, with Leucanthemella
and Nipponanthemum as its closest sisters. Within Subtribe
Artemisiinae, Stilnolepis and Kaschgaria form independent
clades at the base of the subtribe. Similar to the MP tree,
the same three major clades are resolved (Fig. 1).
Bootstrap analysis of the data using ML criteria was not
computationally feasible given the size of the data set.
Therefore as an alternative, we conducted a Bayesian analysis utilizing a GTR model with 6 rate classes (A-C = 1, AG = 3.19, A-T = 1, C-G = 1, C-T = 5.16, G-T = 1) for 1 × 106
generations sampled every 10 generations that resulted in
a posterior probability distribution containing 1 × 105
samples. The analysis converged on similar log likelihood
scores (mean = -2431), and reached stationarity no later
than 2500 generations. The initial ('burn-in') 2500 samples from the analysis were discarded and a majority rule
consensus tree of the remaining 97,500 samples was constructed to obtain posterior probabilities, and resulted in
a tree with 21 ingroup nodes with a significance level

(Fig. 1). The Bayesian tree was identical in topology to the
ML tree, with the exception that the New World Seriphidium subclade was unresolved.

Discussion
Monophyly of Subtribe Artemisiinae and the Artemisiagroup
The ITS data provide weak support for the monophyly of
Subtribe Artemisiinae (Fig. 1), i.e., 67% posterior probability as estimated by MrBayes and unsupported as measured by parsimony bootstrap analysis (<50%). ndhF
sequence data also failed to resolve or support the monophyly of Subtribe Artemisiinae [64]. In the ITS phylogeny,
only one genus appears to disrupt its monophyly, Stilnolepis, which occupies the basal-most position of the ingroup. However, the next node up is supported at a 94%
posterior probability, indicating that Subtribe Artemisiinae is likely monophyletic, with the possible exception of
Stilnolepis.

The ITS phylogeny (Fig. 1) resolved three major clades
within Subtribe Artemisiinae that correspond to the following: 1) all subgenera of Artemisia minus Dracunculus,
2) Artemisia subg. Dracunculus, and 3) the largely radiate
members of the subtribe (Ajania, Arctanthemum, and Dendranthema). All three clades have segregate genera embedded within each (indicated in bold), and these clades are
supported at 77, 74, and 99% posterior probabilities, respectively, with the third clade also supported by a bootstrap value of 99%. The Artemisia-group sensu Bremer and
Humphries [2] is not monophyletic because three segregate genera Elachanthemum, Stilnolepis, and Kaschgaria are
excluded from this clade. Additionally, Artemisia s.l. is
monophyletic only with the inclusion of five segregate
genera: Seriphidium, Sphaeromeria, Neopallasia, Crossostephium, and Filifolium. Additionally, this clade is only
weakly supported with a 63% posterior probability and
bootstrap support <50%.
Placement of segregate and allied genera
Three of the eight segregate and allied genera that we examined were placed outside of the Artemisia-group (including Stilnolepis, Elachanthemum, and Kaschgaria),
whereas the remaining five were placed within it (including Seriphidium, Sphaeromeria, Neopallasia, Crossostephium,
and Filifolium). However many of these placements are
among the most weakly supported branches of the resulting phylogenetic trees (Fig. 1).

Stilnolepis, Elachanthemum, and Kaschgaria are excluded
from the clade of the Artemisia-group, and are, in part, sister to all remaining Artemisiinae genera in the ITS phylogeny. Stilnolepis and Elachanthemum are monotypic genera
that occur in Central Asia, that are often treated as a single

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/2/17

genus, Stilnolepis [2]. However, our ITS phylogeny supports Ling's treatment of them as two distinct genera [54].
Neither genus appears to be a member of Artemisia s.l. or
the Artemisia-group. Both genera are discoid with corymbose capitula, but whether either genus possesses spineless pollen (a synapomorphy for the Artemisia-group) or is
wind-pollinated has not yet been determined [2,37]. Kaschgaria, a genus of two species from China and central
Asia, is also placed outside of the Artemisia-group, but
clearly within Subtribe Artemisiinae (94% probability) in
the ITS phylogeny. Kaschgaria was removed by Poljakov
from Artemisia s.l. on the basis of stellate corolla hairs, and
was considered more closely related to Seriphidium than
Artemisia s.s., even though it is disciform rather than discoid [2]. Kaschgaria possesses spineless pollen [2,37].
Therefore, placement of Kaschgaria and Elachanthemum
outside of the Artemisia-group is intriguing because if
these placements remain robust, wind-pollination may
have arisen more than once in the tribe, or insect-pollination may be secondarily derived within Subtribe Artemisiinae in the radiate genera (clade 3 of Fig. 1).
Four of the small allied/segregate genera are embedded
within the clade of the Artemisia-group, in addition to the
large segregate genus Seriphidium (Fig. 1). Filifolium is sister to species of subg. Dracunculus, and together comprise
a sister clade to all remaining Artemisia species and four
segregate genera, moderately supported at 74% probability. Monotypic Filifolium occurs in China and Korea, and
was previously considered a species of subg. Dracunculus
on the basis of sterile disk florets. Cassini [65] segregated
subg. Dracunculus as Oligosporus with the sterility of the
central florets as the defining synapomorphy that unites
these species (Fig. 2b). Bremer and Humphries [2] noted
that Mausolea and Picrothamnus share this trait, and suggested that Oligosporus should be resurrected and defined
to include these three segregate genera. Mausolea was segregated by Poljakov [38] from Artemisia s.l. by marginal
flowers that lack corollas. Picrothamnus was established by
Nuttall, but reduced as A. spinescens Hall and Clements,
and according to Bremer and Humphries [2] is essentially
Dracunculus with two autapomorphies: spiny habit and
cobwebby-pilose cypselas. Thus two taxonomic treatments are viable: 1) the recognition of two subgenera
within Artemisia s.l. – subg. Dracunculus and an expanded
subg. Artemisia; or 2) the resurrection of Oligosporus (following Cassini) to include species of subg. Dracunculus,
Filifolium, and perhaps Mausolea and Picrothamnus. Unfortunately we were unable to obtain ITS sequences for Mausolea or Picrothamnus.
Monotypic Crossostephium was treated as a segregate genus
of Artemisia by Bremer and Humphries [2]. It is distinct
from Artemisia by the presence of a coroniform pappus,
however it was once placed near A. californica by Gray [45]

Crossostephium occurs in the Phillipines, Taiwan, southern
Japan, and China, whereas A. californica occurs in western
North America. Based on the ITS results, we conclude that
Crossostephium is allied with Old World Seriphidium and

several Artemisia subg. Artemisia species, and A. californica
is sister to most of the New World species of Seriphidium
(Fig. 1). Although placements of both are weakly supported (68 and 57% probabilities for Crossostephium and A.
californica, respectively; Fig 1).

Neopallasia is a genus of three species that occur in central
Asia, including southern Siberia, Mongolia, and China
[2]. It was segregated from Artemisia by Poljakov [66] on
the basis of several autapomorphies, including pectinate
leaves, central-sterile florets at the apex of the capitulum,
ovoid-lanceolate anther appendages, and a rosette-shaped
arrangement of cypselas on the receptacle. Poljakov [66]
and Bremer and Humphries [2] contended that Neopallasia is closely related to Artemisia subg. Drancunculus. However, the ITS data place Neopallasia sister to Asian species
of Seriphidium and some members of Artemisia subg. Artemisia, close to Crossostephium. This placement is moderately supported at 87% probability.
Sphaeromeria is considered closely related to Artemisia s.l.,
although it was once treated as a section of Tanacetum
[55]. It is a small genus of nine western North American
species, and has no autapomorphies that distinguish it
from Artemisia s.l. Bremer and Humphries [2] suggested
that it might be more closely related to Kaschgaria, a genus
composed of two species that occur in central Asia and
China. They are similar in habit and have similar inflorescences that are slightly elongated. However, in the ITS
phylogeny (Fig. 1), Sphaeromeria is distant to Kaschgaria.
Rather its placement is unsupported within a Seriphidium
subclade that contains several anomalous North American species, some of which have been placed in sect. Tridentatae. However, because of the lack of support for
placement of Sphaeromeria, we are hesitant to suggest that
it be submerged in Artemisia s.l. without further study.
However, it does not appear closely related to Kaschgaria.
Seriphidium palmeri is an anomalous species that was once
treated as segregate genus Artemisiastrum. The ITS phylogeny places it among New World subg. Artemisia species, in
agreement with previous studies [34,35] and not in agreement with Bremer and Humphries [2] who place it near
Seriphidium sect. Tridentatae. This is a strongly supported
relationship at 100% bootstrap and 99% probability.
Thus Artemisiatrum, should not be resurrected, with S.
palmeri more closely related to the New World species of
Artemisia subg. Artemisia rather than with the New World
Seriphidium species that comprise sect. Tridentatae.
Infrageneric classification of Artemisia s.l
While this study is incomplete with regards to subgeneric
boundaries because only a limited number of Artemisia
species was sampled from this large genus, some preliminary conclusions can still be made on emerging patterns
of the derived phylogeny. Artemisia subg. Artemisia is not
supported as monophyletic, with its species placed in six
different clades in the ITS tree (Fig. 1). It is apparently defined taxonomically on the basis of plesiomorphies (heterogamous, disciform capitula with perfect/fertile disk
florets and pistillate ray florets), and needs to be re-cir-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/2/17

cumscribed. Artemisia subg. Absinthium is monophyletic
(96% probability, 76% bootstrap) in the ITS phylogeny
and differs from all other subgenera by a hairy receptacle.
However it is embedded within a clade of species of Old
World subg. Artemisia. Thus, we agree with Gray [45] that
the species of subg. Absinthium should be merged into
subg. Artemisia. Similarly, Old World Seriphidium species
are monophyletic (96% probability), but should also be
subsumed within Artemisia subg. Artemisia.
Previously, the origin of the Tridentatae was unresolved
with competing hypotheses from the New World Artemisia species vs. Old World Seriphidium species being equivocal [34,35]. The current ITS phylogeny suggests that the
closest relatives of Tridentatae lie among the New World
species of Artemisia, in agreement with McArthur and
Plummer [20], perhaps sharing a common ancestry with
A. filifolia and A. californica, in addition to Sphaeromeria,
although monophyly for this subclade is unsupported by
the ITS data. Seriphidium sect. Tridentatae does not share a
most recent common ancestor with Old World Seriphidium species, and it should not be treated with the Old
World woody artemisias, as we and others have previously
suggested [34–36].
Seriphidium sect. Tridentatae is characterized by discoidhomogamous capitula, with the exception of S. bigelowii,
which has occasional heterogamous-disciform capitula of
one pistillate ray floret and two perfect disk florets – a
character that was previously considered a plesiomorphy
or secondary reversal in S. bigelowii [2]. Based on ITS and
chloroplast phylogenies of sect. Tridentatae, we previously
concluded [34,35] that S. bigelowii was perhaps misplaced
and should be excluded from the Tridentatae. In addition,
we explained [34,35] an unexpected relationship between
it and A. filfifolia as possible hybridization and introgression involving bidirectional gene flow rather than recent
common ancestry because heterogamous-disciform A.
bigelowii differs from heterogamous-disciform A. filifolia
by perfect disk florets instead of female-sterile disk florets.
Sphaeromeria also has heterogamous-disciform capitula
with pistillate ray and perfect disk florets, as does heterogamous-disciform S. bigelowii, suggesting that it is indeed
a plesiomorphy. The occasional appearance of disciform
capitula in S. bigelowii might be explained by introgression of genes or alleles from A. filfolia that control ray expression, a phenomenon observed in discoid Senecio
squallidus and radiate S. vulgaris in Europe [67]. While this
is speculative, it is consistent with hypotheses that hybridization and introgression are widespread in sect. Tridentatae [68], and may explain occasional heterogamous
disciform capitula in S. bigelowii [34,35]. However, there
may be many genetic and developmental mechanisms
that affect ray formation and control floret fertility
[69,70].

Artemisia subg. Drancunculus is monophyletic and is sister
to all remaining Artemisia species. It, perhaps combined
with Filifolium, Mausolea, and Picrothamnus, could be treated as a separate genus, Oligosporus (following Cassini), or
as one of two subgenera of Artemisia. In the latter case, all
remaining species of Artemisia (including subg. Absinthium and Artemisia) and Seriphidium (including sect. Tridentatae) would collectively form a much expanded subg.
Artemisia. Thus, Artemisia s.l. should either be treated as
two subgenera, i.e., a largely expanded subg. Artemisia
(Clade 1 of Fig. 1) and Dracunculus (Clade 2 of Fig. 1), or
as two distinct genera, Artemisia and Oligosporus. Both
clades are moderately supported at 77 and 74% probabilities, and include several segregate genera as well. Therefore, we favor retaining the Linnean concept of the genus
with subg. Dracunculus conserved, and the numerous segregate genera eventually being subsumed within Artemisia
s.l.
Sister group relationships of Subtribe Artemisiinae
Sister group relationships of Subtribe Artemisiinae were
unresolved on the basis of morphology [2]. However an
ITS phylogeny of Francisco-Ortega et al. [62] that primarily focused on the origin of Macaronesian endemic genera
of Anthemideae revealed a possible sister group relationship of Leucanthemella and Nipponanthemum (Subtribe
Leucantheminae) to Subtribe Artemisiinae. Monotypic
Nipponanthemum occurs in Japan and the two species of
Leucanthemella occur in Eastern Europe and the Far East in
Manchuria, Korea, and Japan. An ITS phylogeny of Subtribe Leucantheminae [71] also excluded these two genera
from that subtribe, which is otherwise Mediterranean in
distribution, congruent with a chloroplast phylogeny
based on ndhF for the entire tribe [64]. The ndhF phylogeny failed to support the subtribal classification of Tribe
Anthemideae sensu Bremer and Humphries, and failed to
resolve the intergeneric relationships or support the
monophyly of Subtribe Artemisiinae. However this study
resulted in the recognition of the importance of biogeography in the evolution of the tribe as a whole, with a major divergence between relictual South African genera and
Northern Hemisphere Eurasian genera where members of
Subtribe Artemisiinae were placed. Our ITS phylogeny of
Subtribe Artemisiinae that included 40 outgroup genera
from seven Anthemideae subtribes also supports a sister
group relationship of Nipponanthemum and Leucanthemella to Subtribe Artemisiinae (Fig. 1).

A close resemblance of Nipponanthemum and Leucanthemella to the Asian genus Dendranthema of Subtribe Artemisiinae was previously noted by Bremer and Humphries
[2], when they provisionally placed these genera in Subtribe Leucantheminae. The ITS data clearly support a sister
group relationship between these two genera and subtribe
Artemisiinae and their exclusion from Subtribe Leucan-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/2/17

theminae. Both Leucanthemella and Nipponanthemum are
radiate, supporting a radiate ancestry for Subtribe Artemisiinae.
Evolution of floral traits
The genera that comprise the Artemisia-group are closely
related and were considered monophyletic on the basis of
ancestrally, disciform-heterogamous capitula and spineless pollen, with discoid capitula secondarily derived by
the loss of ray or marginal florets (Fig. 2). Phaeostigma and
Ajania, which are sister to the Artemisia-group in the Bremer and Humphries [2] cladogram, contain some species
that were once classified as Artemisia s.l. since they are also
disciform. However, these two genera were removed from
Artemisia s.l., and on the basis of spiny pollen have been
considered transitional between the Artemisia-group and
four radiate genera: Tridactylina Arctanthemum, Brachanthemum, and Dendranthema. Our ITS phylogeny places
disciform Ajania sister to radiate Arctanthemum derived
from within the Arctanthemum-Dendranthema clade, rather
than sister to the Artemisia-group. Thus, disciform Ajania
does not appear to be intermediate between radiate Artemisiinae and disciform Artemisia and allies. Furthermore, the tentative placement of disciform Kaschgaria and
discoid Stilnolepis sister to the entire subtribe suggests that
there may have been multiple origins for disciform, as
well as discoid capitula.
Biogeography
A complex scenario for the origin and diversification of
Artemisia and Seriphidium, and subsequent parallel evolution of the two genera in the Old and New Worlds, was
proposed by Ling [39,49]. The putative common ancestor
to both "sister genera" was hypothesized to have existed
in northern Asia, based on reported fossil pollen records
that date the taxa to the early Oligocene or lower Eocene
of the lower Tertiary, with speciation accompanied by migrations during the Tertiary and Quaternary periods –
forced southward by the advancing polar ice sheets. Hypothesized migrations out of northern Asia purportedly
occurred along three lines: 1) westward into Europe, with
gradual migration into North America, western Asia, Asia
Minor, the Mediterranean, and Africa; 2) eastward into Siberia into western North America, and into eastern Europe; and 3) further south into Asia primarily during the
Quaternary. Seriphidium is clearly embedded as two distinct clades within Artemisia in the molecular phylogenies,
making a sister group relationship unlikely.

According to Ling [39,49], a 'pro-Absinthium' ancestor in
northern Asia gave rise to members of Absinthium, which
directly gave rise to Abrotanum, which subsequently gave
rise to Seriphidium. An Absinthium origin for Seriphidium
has also been proposed on the basis of flavonoid data
[72]. The ITS data do not support a sister group relation-

ship of members of subg. Absinthium to the remainder of
Artemisia s.l. In contrast, Absinthium is embedded within a
derived clade composed of both Old and New World
members of subg. Artemisia. A proposed secondary diversification occurred during the Himalayan uplift in the late
Tertiary, and resulted in a center of diversity that today
harbors 116 species of regional endemics of Artemisia s.s.
A more detailed examination of Artemisia s.l. is necessary
to more fully evaluate this hypothesis.
Hall and Clements [44] proposed a sister group relationship of subg. Artemisia to remaining subgenera. This hypothesis is also not supported because subg. Artemisia is
not monophyletic. In contrast, the ITS phylogeny supports an early divergence of subg. Dracunculus from the remaining Artemisia subgenera.
It appears that the New World species of Artemisia s.l. are
paraphyletic and that the North American lineages arose
once with at least one back migration to the Old World by
some members of subg. Artemisia and Absinthium (Fig. 2).
Alternatively, the North American lineages may have arisen twice, independently. Graham [73] suggested that the
most convincing earliest fossil pollen records for Artemisia
are late Oligocene from Central Europe. In all likelihood,
Subtribe Artemisiinae and Artemisia s. l. originated in Eurasia sharing a relatively ancient common ancestry with
Asian members of Leucantheminae and South African
members of Subtribe Matricariinae [64].

and Big Dye Terminator Chemistry (Applied Biosystems,
Inc., Foster City, CA). The sequence boundaries of the
spacers were determined by comparison to published Artemisia sequences [34], and complete sequences were deposited in GenBank (see additional file 1). All ITS
sequences were aligned using Clustal W [77], with manual
gap adjustments made to improve the alignment (see additional file 2, nexus.doc).
MP analyses were performed using the software PAUP*
4.0 [78], assuming unordered character states and equal
character state weighting. Gaps were treated as missing data. The HEURISTICS search option was used, ignoring invariant and uninformative characters. Random addition
of sequences for 10 replicates with TREE BISECTION-RECONNECTION (TBR) branch swapping on 5000 trees per
replicate, and 100 replicates with TBR swapping on 1000
trees per replicate were performed using the following settings: MULTREES, STEEPEST DESCENT, MAXTREES =
30,000, and accelerated transformation (ACCTRAN).
Strict consensus trees were constructed, and bootstrap values were calculated as measures of branch support [79] using the following bootstrap parameters: 100 bootstrap
replicates, 5000 MAXTREES per replicate, random addition sequence, TBR, STEEPEST DESCENT, and MULTREES. In addition, the Consistency Index (CI), Retention
Index (RI), and the Rescaled Consistency Index (RC) were
calculated as measures of homoplasy in the data.

Methods

An ML analysis was also conducted as a preferred alternative to MP since comparative studies have shown that in
most situations MP can fail to resolve an accurate phylogeny and generally underestimates bootstrap support [80].
Model based analyses, such as ML, estimate actual site
changes from observed by taking into account various aspects of molecular evolution, such as multiple hits and
among site rate heterogeneity. Simulation studies have
shown that ML is typically more accurate and robust than
MP [81,82]. Thus an ML analysis of the data was conducted by employing an heuristic search in PAUP* using TBR
branch swapping on a starting tree based on neighbor
joining, ACCTRAN, and STEEPEST DESCENT under the
TrN+G DNA substitution model [83]. This model was selected using a Hierarchical Likelihood Ratio Test (HLRT)
in Modeltest version 3.06 [84].

ITS sequences were obtained for 57 species representing
11 genera of Subtribe Artemisiinae, and 41 outgroup species from seven additional Anthemideae subtribes.
Voucher specimens were deposited in herbaria (see additional file 1). Total genomic DNA was isolated from fresh
or silica-gel dried leaves using the 2X CTAB procedure
[74,75]. The ITS region was amplified using primers of
White et al. [76], as previously described [34]. For unpublished sequences, the spacers were sequenced on an ABI
PRISM 310® Genetic Analyzer using capillary sequencing

Because bootstrap analysis using ML is not computationally feasible for large data sets [85], we conducted a Bayesian analysis as an alternative employing optimization
parameters similar to the nucleotide substitution model
that we used for ML [86,87]. The distinction between ML
and Bayesian inference is that Bayesian provides probabilities for hypotheses, not probabilities of data given a hypothesis [85,87,88]. Bayesian analysis uses Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to approximate posterior

Conclusion
The ITS data do not support the segregation of numerous
small genera or Seriphidium from within the boundaries of
Artemisia. Two major clades for Artemisia s.l. are supported
and include subg. Dracunculus and subg. Artemisia, with
the segregate genera and subgenera of Artemisia embedded within subg. Artemisia. Additionally, three segregate
genera are placed outside of the Artemisia-clade. For Subtribe Artemisiinae, the Artemisia-group of species, are sister to the radiate genera. Additional molecular markers are
necessary to further resolve relationships within the Artemisiinae, before making taxonomic decisions to subsume all segregate genera within Artemisia s.l.

probability distributions that are a direct estimation of
branch support because they are the true probabilities of
the resulting clades under the assumed models, unlike
bootstrap values [87,88]. Additionally, bootstrap values
and posterior probabilities derived from Bayesian analyses for multiple data sets appear to be correlated [88]. The
Bayesian analysis was conducted with the software MrBayes 2.0 [89]. A GTR substitution model with 6 rate frequencies was selected as the most similar model to the
Trn+G substitution model (the latter model is not available in MrBayes). Four MCMC chains were used with initial
random starting trees. The analysis was run for 1 × 106
generations with trees sampled every 10 generations resulting in 1 × 105 samples. The analysis reached stationarity at 2500 generations, and these burnin samples were
excluded from the majority rule consensus tree of 97,500
samples, which was generated with PAUP* to obtain the
Bayesian posterior probabilities.
