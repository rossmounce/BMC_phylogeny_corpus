Nonsynonymous substitution rate (Ka) is a
relatively consistent parameter for defining fastevolving and slow-evolving protein-coding genes

Abstract
Background: Mammalian genome sequence data are being acquired in large quantities and at enormous speeds.
We now have a tremendous opportunity to better understand which genes are the most variable or conserved,
and what their particular functions and evolutionary dynamics are, through comparative genomics.
Results: We chose human and eleven other high-coverage mammalian genome data–as well as an avian genome as
an outgroup–to analyze orthologous protein-coding genes using nonsynonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks)
substitution rates. After evaluating eight commonly-used methods of Ka and Ks calculation, we observed that these
methods yielded a nearly uniform result when estimating Ka, but not Ks (or Ka/Ks). When sorting genes based on Ka,
we noticed that fast-evolving and slow-evolving genes often belonged to different functional classes, with respect to
species-specificity and lineage-specificity. In particular, we identified two functional classes of genes in the acquired
immune system. Fast-evolving genes coded for signal-transducing proteins, such as receptors, ligands, cytokines, and
CDs (cluster of differentiation, mostly surface proteins), whereas the slow-evolving genes were for function-modulating
proteins, such as kinases and adaptor proteins. In addition, among slow-evolving genes that had functions related to
the central nervous system, neurodegenerative disease-related pathways were enriched significantly in most
mammalian species. We also confirmed that gene expression was negatively correlated with evolution rate, i.e. slowevolving genes were expressed at higher levels than fast-evolving genes. Our results indicated that the functional
specializations of the three major mammalian clades were: sensory perception and oncogenesis in primates,
reproduction and hormone regulation in large mammals, and immunity and angiotensin in rodents.
Conclusion: Our study suggests that Ka calculation, which is less biased compared to Ks and Ka/Ks, can be used as
a parameter to sort genes by evolution rate and can also provide a way to categorize common protein functions
and define their interaction networks, either pair-wise or in defined lineages or subgroups. Evaluating gene
evolution based on Ka and Ks calculations can be done with large datasets, such as mammalian genomes.

Background
Although protein-coding sequences account for ~1% of
the entire mammalian genome, it is the most functionrelated, dynamic, and informative part of the genome
[1]. For molecular evolution studies, protein-coding
sequences are central to understanding the mutational

dynamics of genes and the functional dynamics of gene
networks within a population or among diverse species
and lineages.
Following the publication of the complete human genome sequence [2], over a dozen mammalian genomes
have been sequenced, allowing mammalian comparative
genomics to finally come to age. Genome-wide sequence
analysis has been focused on two essential forms of
genetic variation. One concerns gene gain-and-loss that
is related to the amplification and deletion of certain
genes and their chromosomal regions. This is an

important evolutionary mechanism to shape mammalian
genomes through natural selection, but it also leads to
gene family expansion and deletion, which has been
proposed to be one molecular origin of chimp-human
evolution [3]. Another form of genetic variation is
sequence variation at specific nucleotide sites in proteincoding genes. Such variations become functionally relevant when they alter protein sequences.
The task of defining positively-selected genes has
drawn the most attention, because these genes are often
considered to be the major driving forces behind how
organisms adapt to their external environments [4,5].
A number of interesting characteristics of positively
selected genes have been found: (1) they are more likely
to have several classes of functions, including nuclear
transport, sensory perception, immune defenses, tumor
suppression, apoptosis, and reproduction, and may be
involved in Mendelian genetic disorders [6-8]. (2) These
genes tend to be expressed at low levels and in a tissuespecific manner [7]. (3) Some highly-expressed genes in
the testis were reported to have been subjected to positive selection [6]. (4) Positively selected genes are often
species-specific or lineage-specific [7]. As the number of
sequenced genomes increases, new approaches and
novel methodology will be needed to develop efficient
tools for mining vast amounts of sequence data.
Here, we report a novel yet basic method of defining
fast-evolving and slow-evolving genes based on nonsynonymous substitution rates (Ka) in different subgroups
or lineages of mammals. We first tested different computational models to see if they provided consistent
results when defining the evolution rates of diverse gene
classes and families. We then identified percentage
shared genes (orthologs) among lineages that were calculated based on different methods, and also looked in
more detail at their cellular functions and functional
pathways. We also examined the relationship between
the evolutionary rates and gene expression levels of
these genes, using high-coverage genome sequence and
transcriptomic data from thirteen vertebrate species,
including human [9], chimpanzee [10], orangutan [11],
macaque [12], horse [13], dog [14], cow [15], guinea pig,
mouse [16], rat [17], opossum [18], platypus [19], and
chicken [20]. Our new method not only confirms the
results of many previous studies, but also provides a
new and straightforward approach to understanding the
evolutionary dynamics of mammalian genes.

Results and Discussion
Data and quality control

To examine the divergence between humans and other
species, we calculated identities by averaging all orthologs
in a species: chimpanzee - 99.23%; orangutan - 98.00%;
macaque - 96.09%; horse - 89.44%; dog - 87.93%; cow -

87.36%; guinea pig - 85.91%; mouse - 84.54%; rat 83.92%; opossum - 77.64%; platypus - 74.37%; and
chicken - 72.87%. The data gave rise to a bimodal distribution in overall identities, which distinctly separates
highly identical primate sequences from the rest (Additional file 1: Figure 1SA). For quality assessment, we also
evaluated the alignment qualities of all orthologs.
First, we found that the number of Ns (uncertain
nucleotides) in all coding sequences (CDS) fell within
reasonable ranges (mean ± standard deviation): (1) the
number of Ns/the number of nucleotides = 0.00002740
± 0.00059475; (2) the total number of orthologs containing Ns/total number of orthologs × 100% = 1.5084%.
Second, we evaluated parameters related to the quality
of sequence alignments, such as percentage identity and
percentage gap (Additional file 1: Figure S1). All of
them provided clues for low mismatching rates and limited number of arbitrarily-aligned positions.
Indexing evolutionary rates of protein-coding genes

Ka and Ks are nonsynonymous (amino-acid-changing)
and synonymous (silent) substitution rates, respectively,
which are governed by sequence contexts that are functionally-relevant, such as coding amino acids and involving in exon splicing [21]. The ratio of the two
parameters, Ka/Ks (a measure of selection strength), is
defined as the degree of evolutionary change, normalized by random background mutation. We began by
scrutinizing the consistency of Ka and Ks estimates
using eight commonly-used methods. We defined two
divergence indexes: (i) standard deviation normalized by
mean, where eight values from all methods are considered to be a group, and (ii) range normalized by mean,
where range is the absolute difference between the estimated maximal and minimal values. In order to keep
our comparison unbiased, we eliminated gene pairs
when any NA (not applicable or infinite) value occurred
in Ka or Ks. We observed that the divergence indexes of
Ka were significantly smaller than those of Ks in all
examined species (P-value < 2.2e-16, Wilcoxon rank
sum test) (Figure 1). The result of our second defined
index appeared to be very similar to the first (data not
shown). We also investigated the performance of these
methods in calculating Ka, Ks, and Ka/Ks. First, we considered six cut-off points for grouping and defining fastevolving and slow-evolving genes: 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%,
40%, and 50% of the total (see Methods). Second, we
applied eight commonly-used methods to calculate the
parameters for twelve species at each cut-off value.
Lastly, we compared the percentage of shared genes (the
number of shared genes from different methods, divided
by the total number of genes within a chosen cut-off
point) calculated by GY and other methods (Figure 2).
We observed that Ka had the highest percentage of

shared genes, followed by Ka/Ks; Ks always had the lowest. We also made similar observations using our own
gamma-series methods [22,23] (data not shown). It was
quite clear that Ka calculations had the most consistent
results when sorting protein-coding genes based on
their evolutionary rates. As the cut-off values increased
from 5% to 50%, the percentages of shared genes also
increased, reflecting the fact that more shared genes are
obtained by setting less stringent cut-offs (Figure 2A
and 2B). We also found a rising trend as the model
complexity increased in the order of NG, LWL, MLWL,
LPB, MLPB, YN, and MYN (Figure 2C and 2D). We
examined the impact of divergent distance on gene sorting using the three parameters, and found that the
percentage of shared genes referencing to Ka was consistently high across all twelve species, while those referencing to Ka/Ks and Ks decreased with increasing
divergence time between human and other studied species (Figure 2E and 2F). In addition, the percentage of
shared genes of Ka/Ks remains moderate between those
of Ka and Ks. In particular, there should be more variations in the percentages of shared genes determined by
Ka/Ks and Ks than by Ka, when we define slow-evolving
genes (Figure 2B, D, and 2F). We found consistent
results from the various methods when Ka was used as
the measure for sorting genes.

The methods used in this study cover a wide range of
mutation models with different complexities. NG gives
equal weight to every sequence variation path [24] and
LWL divides the mutation sites into three categories—
non-degenerate, two-fold, and four-fold sites—and
assigns fixed weights to synonymous and nonsynonymous sites for the two-fold degenerate sites [25]. LPB
adopts a flexible ratio of transitional to transversional
substitutions to handle the two-fold sites [26,27].
MLWL or MLPB are improved versions of their parental
methods with specific consideration on the arginine
codons (an exceptional case from the previous method)
[28]. In particular, MLWL also incorporates an independent parameter, the ratio of transitional to transversional substitution rates, into the calculation [28]. Both
YN and GY capture the features of codon usage and
transition/transversion rates, but they are approximate
and maximum likelihood methods, respectively [29,30].
MYN accounts for another important evolutionary characteristic—differences in transitional substitution within
purines and pyrimidines [31]. Although these methods
model and compute sequence variations in different
ways, the Ka values that they calculate appeared to be
more consistent than their Ks values or Ka/Ks. We proposed the following reasons (which are not comprehensive): first, real data from large data sets are usually
from a broader range of species than computer simulations in the training sets for methodology development,
so deviations in Ks values may draw more attentions in
discussions. Second, the parameter-rich approaches—
such as considering unequal codon usage and unequal
transition/transversion rates—may lead to opposite
effects on substitution rates when sequence divergence
falls out of the “sweet ranges” [25,30,32]. Third, when
examining closely related species, such primates, one
will find that most Ka/Ks values are smaller than 1 and
that Ka values are smaller than Ks values under most
conditions. For a very limited number of nonsynonymous substitutions, when evolutionary distance is relatively short between species, models that increase
complexity, such as those for correcting multiple hits,
may not lead to stable estimations [24,32]. Furthermore,
when incorporating the shape parameter of gamma distribution into the commonly approximate Ka/Ks methods, we found previously that Ks is more sensitive to
changes in the shape parameter under the condition Ka
< Ks [23]. Together, there are stronger influences on Ks
than on Ka in two cases: when Ka < Ks and when complexity increases in mutation models. Fourth, it has
been suggested that Ks estimation does not work well
for comparing extremes, such as closely and distantly
related species [33,34]. Occasionally, certain larger Ka/
Ks values, greater than 1, are identified, as was done in

a comparative study between human and chimpanzee
genes, perhaps due to a very small Ks [34].
We also wondered what would happen when Ka
becomes saturated as the divergence of the paired
sequences increases. Looking at human vs. chicken, we
found that the median Ka exceeded 0.2 and that the
maximal Ka was as high as 0.6 after the outliers were
eliminated (Additional file 1: Figure S2). This result suggested that their Ka values have not approached saturation yet. In addition, we chose the GY method to
compute Ka as an estimator of evolutionary rates, since
counting methods usually yield more out-of-range
values than maximum likelihood methods (data not
shown).

Function characterization of fast-evolving and slowevolving genes

To learn about the functions of fast-evolving and slowevolving genes in each species and lineage, we used custom-designed scripts to assess the enrichment of molecular functions (MF), biological processes (BP), and
signal/metabolic pathways (Table 1). We noticed that
the number of enriched functions related to slowevolving genes was 2.53 times greater than those related
to fast-evolving genes. Fast-evolving genes also had
more lineage-specific functions than slow-evolving
genes.
We found that fast-evolving genes were enriched in
immunity-related functions (Table 1), which included

genes present in NK, T, and B cells. The genes in NK
cells were related to innate immunity (non-specific), and
genes in T and B cells were associated with acquired
immunity (specific) [35]. Other enriched immunityrelated categories of fast-evolving genes included immunoglobulin, cytokine, chemokine, and interleukin.
Fast-evolving genes were also enriched in signaling pathways, such as receptors and ligands. Finally, there were a
significant number of fast-evolving genes classified as
having unknown functions—unclassified biological processes and unclassified molecular functions. It is not
surprising that fast-evolving genes may quickly diminish
their homology to known proteins and are associated
with dietary adaptation, language, appearance, behavior
or upright-walking [36]. In the enriched functions of
slow-evolving genes, we found a number of important
house-keeping functional classes, including transcription,
mRNA processing/splicing, translation, protein modification, metabolism, protein traffic, cell cycle, development and endocytosis (Table 1). As a result, fastevolving and slow-evolving genes have significantly
different functions in mammals.
Another point of interest is that we identified two
immunity-related function categories, T cell and B cell
activation, in the enriched functions of slow-evolving
genes (Table 1). We also discovered that immunityrelated fast-evolving genes were mostly receptors,
ligands, cytokines, and CD (cluster of differentiation)
molecules, and that slow-evolving immunity-related
genes were usually kinases or adaptor proteins. Taking
the human-rat comparison as an example, the receptors
included MS4A2, FCER1G, FCGRT, KLRG2, IL1RN,
TNFRSF1A, TNFRSF25, IFNGR1, IL2RA, TNFRSF4 and
TNFRSF8; the cytokines were IL12A and IL1F9; and the
ligands were CCL27 and ICOSLG. All of these are
highly conserved, functionally important, and involved
in complex immunity-related pathways. Cytokines are

also involved in the transfer of information between
cells, the regulation of cell physiological processes, and
the strengthening of immune-competence [37]. CD proteins, generated during the differentiation of lymphocytes, are a class of cell surface molecules that are
recognized by specific antibodies on the surfaces of lymphocytes [38]. Adaptor proteins and kinases play significant roles in signal transduction in cell immune
systems, mediate specific interactions between proteins,
and activate phosphorylation of the target proteins to
functionally modify protein structure and activity
[39,40]. In summary, receptors, ligands, cytokines, and
CDs are likely to evolve faster than kinases and adaptor
proteins, although they all function in the acquired
immune system (B cell and T cell immunity). These
observations suggest that: (1) Genes in the upstream of
the immune-related pathways tend to evolve faster than
those in the downstream. (2) Immunity-specific genes
are likely to evolve faster than multifunctional housekeeping genes, which also perform fundamental functions in non-immune pathways. (3) Genes encoding for
proteins that participate in extracellular communion or
the reorganization of external pathogens seem to evolve
faster than those which encode proteins that play roles
in signal transduction and effector activation within single cells [41]. Similar observations have been reported
about the evolution of Drosophila’s innate immune system [42].
In addition, we discovered a few enriched functions
that were related to neuro-degenerative diseases or nervous system functionality (Table 1). These slow-evolving
genes play roles in progressive neuro-degenerative
genetic diseases [43], neural-tube defects [44], proliferative disorders in the central nervous system [45], progressions of brain cancers [46,47], and electrical
movement within synapses in the brain [48]. These
results are consistent with a previous observation that

brain-specific genes tend to have relatively low evolutionary rates in mammals [49]. Brain-specific genes may
be expressed in multiple distinct neuronal cell types and
in a way resemble house-keeping genes in terms of
shared cell types.
Comparisons of fast-evolving and slow-evolving genes
and their functions among mammalian lineages

We used a network to display the percentages of shared
genes among fast-evolving and slow-evolving genes
between pairs of mammals (Figure 3). First, two primitive mammals (opossum and platypus) and one bird
(chicken) are clearly distinct from other mammals. Second, primates are also closely clustered with one
another. Third, mouse serves as an excellent hub that
links cow, horse, guinea pig, rat, and opossum. Fourth,
large mammals are well connected when all elements
are considered. Fifth, some connections may be coincidental, for example, fast-evolving genes shared by dog,
horse, and macaque as well as slow-evolving genes
shared by cow, macaque, orangutan, and chimp.
We then investigated the exclusive functions of fastevolving and slow-evolving genes in three mammalian
lineages: primates (chimp, orangutan, and macaque),
large mammals (horse, dog, and cow), and rodents (guinea pig, mouse, and rat; Table 2, 3, and 4). Although
primates are also large mammals, we considered them

rat

to be a separate category in order to further stratify our
pool. First, we found specific functions that were unique
to the three mammalian subgroups in fast-evolving
genes: sensory-related (chemosensory perception, olfaction and sensory perception) and cancer related (oncogenesis) in primates (Table 2), immune related
(interleukin receptor) in rodents (Table 4), and reproduction related (fertilization) and steroid hormone
related (steroid hormone metabolism; Table 3) in large
mammals. The first two observations we made are consistent with a previous study [7], and the last one is
novel, which may be related to domestication for fastgrowth. Second, we also found some lineage-specific
functions that involved slow-evolving genes. For
instance, we categorized calcium binding proteins, calmodulin related proteins and mitochondrial transport in
primates, as well as G protein signalling, enkephalin
release, actin binding cytoskeletal proteins, the microtubule family, and exocytosis in rodents. Three critical
hormones (alpha adrenergic receptor signalling, oxytocin
receptor mediated signalling, and thyrotropin-releasing
hormone receptor signalling pathways) are specific to
large mammals.

two models, and have evaluated the use of Ka/Ks in the
identification of positively-selected genes (PSGs) and
their enriched functions among six species [6-8]. Our
study is unique in that we have analyzed 12 species and
considered more than one-thousand fast-evolving genes.
The numbers of PSGs in previous studies were at least
an order of magnitude less, around tens to hundreds.
Although our definition of fast-evolving genes is not
fully identical to those of previous studies, our findings
on immune-related functions in most species are consistent with previous studies [6,7]. Two other categories
that are shared among these studies are chemosensory
perception, olfaction, and sensory perception in the
human-vs-chimpanzee-specific functions (Table 2) and
fertilization in the human-vs-cow-specific functions.
This validated the fact that the methods, which
were based on simple comparison, yielded conclusions
that were similar to those of complicated and overparametric methods.
Lopez-Bigas et al. conducted a comprehensive study of
functional protein sequence divergences between human
and other organisms [50]. They focused on variations at
the protein level and in a wide range of evolutionary

distance, whereas we have focused on variations among
mammals at the DNA level [50]. Natural selection acts at
three essential levels: domains, catalytic centers, and the
DNA and protein level that consists of sequences and protein structures composed of motifs [32]. Since nucleotide
sequences are more variable than protein sequences and
structures, DNA variations are usually used for the study
of short-term evolution, and the latter two are used to
study long-term evolution. In our study, we found that the
major classified functions were regulatory (e.g. receptor)/
response to the surroundings (e.g. immunoglobulin receptor family member) among fast-evolving genes, and metabolism (e.g. protein metabolism and modification),
transport (e.g. general vesicle transport) and cell structure
(e.g. protein biosynthesis) among slow-evolving genes [50].
We also found developmental processes to be a major
functional category in mammals based on the slowevolving genes when regarding chicken as a reference.
This finding agrees with a previous conclusion that development-related genes are highly conserved only among
mammals [50]. In addition, at the DNA level, both B-cellmediated and antibody-mediated immunity and B-cell
activation were only identified in mammals but not in
chickens. This may reflect differences in B-cell-associated
hormonal responses between the bursa of fabricius unique
to birds and the bone marrow of mammals [51].
The relationship between evolutionary rate and
expression level

Our study focused on general expression profiles based
on EST data from 18 human tissues (Figure 4). The
expression levels of slow-evolving genes appeared to be
significantly higher than those of fast-evolving genes
(P-value < 2.2e-16, Wilcoxon rank sum test). We also
observed that the expression levels of intermediatelyevolving genes were significantly higher than those of
fast-evolving genes in most species, except for orangutan
and macaque. In addition, we found that the mean of
gene expressions was always greater than the median,
suggesting that most genes are expressed at very low
levels and only a small fraction of genes are expressed
at high levels [52]. These observations suggest that there
is an inverse relationship between gene evolutionary
rates and gene expression levels in mammals, which is
similar to a previous result reported for the yeast genome [53,54]. House-keeping [55,56], highly-expressed,
and old genes [57,58] all tend to evolve slowly [59], and
these genes are functionally well-connected and resistant
to sequence changes (negative selected). Tissue-specific
[55,56], lowly-expressed, and new genes [57,58] tend to
evolve quickly; they are often selection-relaxed and evolving toward novel functions. For example, certain
immune-related genes always evolve faster to cope with
new or multiple pathogen attacks.

The shared fast-evolving and slow-evolving genes among
mammals

To understand the functional relevance common for the
fast-evolving or slow-evolving genes among different
subgroups of mammals, we categorized the shared genes
in the lineages of primates, large mammals, and rodents.
There were 185, 609, and 695, fast-evolving genes in primates, large mammals, and rodents, respectively, and
355, 600, and 730 slow-evolving genes. However, we
only found 15 fast-evolving and 72 slow-evolving genes
that were shared by all nine species. This result suggests
that fast-evolving and slow-evolving genes tend to be
clade-, lineage- or species-specific. However, a limited
numbers of shared genes may still lead to a significant
number of shared functions (Table 1).
Although we have only compared human genes (as a
reference) with those of other mammals, instead of
doing pairwise comparisons, our conclusions can still be
easily extended to a broader spectrum of mammals, or
even other vertebrates. To validate our analyses, we
selected two representative proteins, ISG20 and RAB30
(based on orthologs from 20 and 22 mammals, respectively) from 87 shared fast-/slow-evolving genes in nine
species to demonstrate their degrees of variation and
conservation (Figure 5). The fast-evolving ISG20 (ranked
25, 71, 94, 69, 95, 128, 321, 58, 82, 280 and 423 in
chimpanzee, orangutan, macaque, horse, dog, cow, guinea pig, mouse, rat, opossum and platypus, respectively)

and the slow-evolving RAB30 (ranked 1, 418, 334, 117,
105, 127, 48, 49, 33, 132 and 446, respectively in chimpanzee, orangutan, macaque, horse, dog, cow, guinea
pig, mouse, rat, opossum and platypus, respectively) can
be obviously seen from the degree of variability [60].
These two case studies provide a footnote that supports
the reliability of our method.

Conclusions
In this study, we carried out an evolutionary analysis of
human protein-coding genes that are shared among
mammals. We not only demonstrated that Ka is a useful
and stable indicator for studying mammalian gene evolution, but we also revealed that the rate at which a
gene evolves is related to its function. In particular, we
found enriched immune-related functions in both fastevolving and slow-evolving genes, and slow-evolving
genes were significantly enriched in functions related to
the central nervous system. Furthermore, we observed
that slow-evolving genes tended to be expressed at
higher levels. Our results provide valuable insights for
the functional characterization of genes and gene classes
in different mammalian lineages.

the defining characteristics of fast and slow evolving
genes. This subject has been addressed extensively in
the literature, and the findings of the present manuscript are not novel. Unfortunately, the lack of novelty is
not the biggest fault of this article: the methodology

between human and the other species in their dataset.
The Ka and Ks computations are performed with several
methods available in the literature, and they observe that
the Ks measurement does not yield consistent results
between the different methods employed. Rather than
investigating in detail why this happens (the saturation
problem is only briefly mentioned), the authors decide
to use Ka as an estimate of the rate of evolution. This is
of course correct if the rate of protein sequence evolution is of interest, but without any correction for the
mutation rate, one cannot make inferences about the
strength of natural selection on protein-coding genes
based on Ka alone. Yet the authors use Ka as “an estimator of selection” (page 9).
Authors’ response

We added a few discussion points about the reason why
Ka values from multiple methods yield more consistent
results than Ks values. We also changed the description
“an estimator of selection” into “Ka as an estimator of
evolutionary rate”.
The authors then go on to compare the results
obtained for the different mammals, and they infer lineage-specific accelerations based solely on the pairwise
“human-other species” comparisons. This does not

make sense. The authors should be aware that there are
methods for the estimation of branch-specific Ka, Ks
and Ka/Ks ratios that use a multiple-species sequence
alignment and that take into account the underlying
phylogeny (see for example PAML — perhaps the most
commonly used — Z. Yang, Mol. Biol. Evol., 2007).
Authors’ response

We are fully aware that the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT)
methods [71,72] are applicable in inferring positive
selections on genes in specific braches (or clades) and
researchers use these methods to different species including mammals and others [6-8,73]. One of the objectives
of our study is to compare our method based on simple
pairwise comparison between human and other mammals with the LRT methods. We found that our method
is simply capable of capturing the key conclusions from
other methods and can be used to discover evolutionary
features of lineage-specific genes (such as lineage-specific
functions of large mammals). Furthermore, pairwise
alignments utilize more sequence information than multiple sequence alignments do, especially when closely
related (for instance, a few percent differences) and lessthan-perfect sequences are aligned. The LRT methods
usually require the construction of phylogenies and

Wang et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:13
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/13

compare two models, and they are usually parameterrich, especially when a large number of sequences from
multiple species are examined. After all, we are not here
to challenge the power of the LRT methods, but to suggest a simple and efficient method as an alternative.
Finally, the manuscript is very poorly written, to the
point that the meaning of the phrases is often incomprehensible. This is evident even for the title: “A method
for defining evolving protein-coding genes” — evolving
as opposed to what?
Authors’ response

We revised the manuscript again for clarity and accuracy. We also changed the title into “A method for defining fast-evolving and slow-evolving protein-coding genes”.
Comments from the second round of reviewing

I am not in the least convinced by the revision of the
manuscript. The modifications to the original manuscript are only superficial, and the content remains
unworthy of publication. None of the results are new.
The analysis of Ka rates is now so well established, that
it is generally done in practical courses, for a bachelor’s
degree, and cannot by itself constitute the subject of a
publication. Moreover, the methodology and the interpretation of the results are flawed. The authors continue
to perform pairwise comparisons between human and
each of the other species, and yet they discuss lineagespecific accelerations. This does not make sense. To
give just one example, the authors discuss the proportion of fast-evolving genes that are ‘shared among mammals’. Could it be that these genes are in fact
accelerated only in the human lineage? When performing pairwise comparisons, with human as a reference,
the genes that are specific to human would appear as
fast-evolving in all comparisons.
Authors’ response

First, what we are emphasizing here is not the ways to
calculate Ka and Ks but their overall effects on data
analyses, which are useful for the end users, especially
biologists who are eager to understand the essence of the
methodology and their applications. Second, the calculations for Ka and Ks values are all relative. We have several reasons for choosing just human-to-other-mammal
comparisons. The most important reason is the fact that
human data are the best among all mammalian genomes sequenced so far. Other mammalian genomes are
not sequenced, assembled, and annotated to the standard of human data yet. The net result for choosing a
shared ortholog set for all mammals, due to the variable
data quality, is that we will not be able to find good
representatives for fast-evolving genes that share similar
functional categories since most of the gene annotations
rely heavily on those of the human data. Especially for
extreme cases, such as fast-evolving genes, we do not
anticipate that these genes themselves are shared by all

Page 13 of 17

or even most of the mammals but do share the specific
functional categories. The second reason why we only use
human-to-other-mammal comparison is data size. If we
did an all-against-all analysis, we would have to write
several other manuscripts to describe our results and
that would not be desirable either at this point in time:
we would have to improve the data quality for all other
sequenced mammals, except for human and mouse perhaps, which are better assembled and annotated. The
last, but not the least important, reason we have chosen
to compare human genes to their orthologs in other
mammalian species is so that we can understand the
evolution rates of human genes first. In other words, we
want to first investigate how human protein-coding genes
have evolved from their ancestors in other presumably
distinct mammalian lineages. In addition, we carried out
a mouse-centric analysis and validated most of the

Subhajyoti De, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard University, Boston, USA (nominated by Sarah Teichmann, MRC
Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, United
Kingdom).
The paper ‘A method for defining evolving protein
coding genes’ by Wang et al. presents an evolutionary
analysis of orthologus protein-coding genes across different species. My main concern with this paper is the
lack of novelty. The main conclusions of this paper —
(i) different functional classes of genes evolve differently,
(ii) highly expressed genes evolve slowly and (iii) fast
evolving genes often evolve in a lineage-specific manner
—have already been reported comprehensively by several groups (Gerstein, Siepel, Hurst, Koonin, Drummond, Nielsen, Bustamante and many other labs). The
authors merely reconfirm their findings. Many of those
previous papers are not cited either.
Authors’ response

As pointed out by Dr. Claus O. Wilke, we do have a “central hypothesis” here, which is novel and valid. We are not
contradicting any of the conclusions made by many others
who have applied the methods we used also to analyze
mammalian genomes or any other multiple sequences, but
merely share our surprise that Ka calculation is unusually
robust among all these methods. Nevertheless, we added
more citations in the revised version as we made further
comparisons with several representative publications.
I am also confused with the other conclusion of this
paper — ‘Ka is better than Ka/Ks and Ks for evolutionary estimation’. Ka, Ks and Ka/Ks quantify different evolutionary features, and it would be unfair to compare
them directly.

Authors’ response

We revised the sentence and it is now reads: “Ka estimated from a diverse selection of methods has more consistent results than Ka/Ks and Ks.
In addition, many statements in that section are incorrect. For instance,
(i) “Ka/Ks and Ka are usually used to weigh the evolutionary rate for large number of genes, where the
former has been used more frequently.” — Ka/Ks is
a measure of selection, and not used to calculate
evolutionary divergence per se.
Authors’ response

We have revised this sentence accordingly.
(ii) “We decided to choose Ka, an estimator of selection, rather than Ks, an indicator of random mutations
for our studies” — Ka is a measure of nonsynonymous
divergence and not a measure of selection. Moreover,
Ks is often influenced by sequence context (see papers
by Laurence Hurst in 2007).
Authors’ response

We have revised the sentences and added the citation
accordingly.
(iii) “Occasionally, larger Ka/Ks values, greater than 1,
have been identified, such as those in a comparative
study between human and chimpanzee, perhaps
due to smaller Ks (Koonin and Rogozin, 2003)” — the
statement, and the paragraph, lead to an incomplete
impression that all Ka/Ks > 1 in human-chimpanzee
are due to small Ks and therefore not indicative of
selection. Yes, it is possible that for some genes high
Ka/Ks can arise by chance, but that’s not the complete picture. Many genes with high Ka/Ks ratio are
classic examples of positive selection (e.g. FOXP2,
and also see Clark et al. Science, 2003 [8], Nielsen et
al. in PLoS Biol. 2005 [6]).
Authors’ response

We have revised the sentences accordingly.
Lopez-Bigas et al. studied evolution of human protein
coding genes in different eukaryotes ranging from primates and other mammals to yeast at the protein
sequence level. They also showed that sequence similarity
and Ka (or dN) are highly correlated (see supplementary
information of Lopez Bigas et al. [50]). Therefore it is not
surprising that using Ka, the authors find similar results.

similarity and nonsynonymous substitution rates (nonsynonymous substitutions/nonsynonymous sites) on the
basis of nucleotide substitution models may lead to
different results. In addition, we did find some new functions at the DNA level (e.g. B cell- and antibodymediated immunity as well as B-cell activation).
Please note that Gene and ortholog annotation have
improved since Ensembl v53 (especially for chimpanzee,
orang etc). Moreover, gene expression data for over 70
tissue types in both human and mouse are available
from GNF-Symatlas, and it is pretty comprehensive.
Authors’ response

We are grateful to the reviewer for the note. Actually, at
the time we began this project, Ensembl version 53
(released in 2009) was the most up-to-date. We did
check the newer versions and the methodology used for
database construction has not been changed. The only
things that have changed are a few up-to-date genome
assemblies which will only result in incremental
improvements on a negligible fraction of the genes that
we analyzed here. We used previously published procedures to select Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) data from
18 representative tissues (referring to major anatomic
systems and succeeded in applying the data to define
housekeeping genes [56,70]and minimal introns related
studies [74]. It is rather unfortunate that the current
RNA-seq data have not covered enough tissue samples
yet. In addition, the house-keeping genes we defined seem
holding very well in our recent analysis with limited
number of tissue samples (around 10; data not shown).
The authors calculated Ka, Ks, Ka/Ks using several
different algorithms and found that results do not
exactly overlap i.e. shared gene ratio is not 100%. Perhaps it would be interesting to evaluate the performance
of those algorithms, check which ones provide more
consistent results and why.
Authors’ response

In the computer simulations of our previous studies, we
have found that the Ka/Ks-calculating methods based on
similar substitution models (capturing similar evolutionary features) often yielded similar results [23,75]. In this
study, however, we were surprised to find consistent Ka
values from this diverse group of methods. We added
new analyses and discussions in the revised manuscript
concerning the causative factors of inconsistency between
different methods’ estimates of Ka and Ks.

Authors’ response

Reviewer’s report 3

Lopez-Bigas et al found a negative correlation (nearly
-0.7) between Conservation Score (CS) and Ka [50].
This linearly correlated relationship does not mean that
the two indexes are exactly the same. As matter of fact,
the same protein may be encoded by different codons at
the nucleotide level. Therefore, the calculations of protein

The authors study the evolutionary rates of mammalian genes using eight different methods of evolutionaryrate calculation. They conclude that Ka is more

Wang et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:13
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/13

consistently estimated by these different methods than
Ks and that therefore Ka will be more informative in
many contexts than Ks or Ka/Ks.
While I think that the paper makes a valuable contribution, I feel that the impact of the paper has been diluted
by the authors’ choice to actually combine two separate
parts (with separate messages) into one paper. The first
part (which I find valuable) is the analysis of the consistency of rate estimations by different methods. The second
part (of whose value I’m less convinced) looks at the functional classification of genes evolving at different rates.
Authors’ Response

The point is well-taken. In the second part, we just showed
selective examples (maybe just the tip of the iceberg) for
possible applications of the method. We have weakened
some of our conclusions in the second part and explained
the weakness of the data set itself (see response to the
Reviewer 1). We are in the process of doing thorough analysis on genes that are classified based on Ka values
among mammalian genomes, and pinpointing their functional roles in gene interaction networks.
Specific comments:
1. The first part is improved in the revision, but still
not entirely satisfying. I don’t really get a good takehome message from this part. Which method should
I use to estimate evolutionary rates? Are there specific reasons why some methods give different results
than others? Maybe the differences in Ks results
simply reflect improvements in estimation methods
over time? Note that the model abbreviations (NG,
LWL, MLWL, etc) are never defined.
Authors’ response

We continue to improve our writing in the current revision. The take-home messages for the first part are twofold. First, Ka calculation is more consistent than Ks
calculation regardless of what methods are used. Second,
depending on the evolutionary distance between the
sequences of the two species evaluated, one can choose
more or less complex models for Ka and Ks calculation
but they result in more or less similar results for Ka but
not for Ks. The reasons why Ks values vary when using
different methods are complicated, as we have discussed
in the manuscript. We added a note to explain the naming conventions for the different methods.
2. I remain unconvinced by the second part. My
most important criticism, that the functional characterization is confounded by expression level, has not
been substantially addressed.
Authors’ response

We cited 8 consecutive references (from 52 to 59) where
this issue has been intensively discussed.

Page 15 of 17

3. I’m not convinced that the title faithfully reflects
the contents of the paper. What is the method for
defining fast-evolving and slow-evolving protein-coding genes? If the method is simply “Use Ka”, I’d
argue that people have done that before.
Authors’ response

We have changed the title to “Nonsynonymous substitution rate (Ka) is a relatively consistent parameter for
defining fast-evolving and slow-evolving protein-coding
genes”. We have searched the related literature carefully
and have not found publications that have done such
thorough evaluations on the methods.
