Abstract
Background: Crocodilians (Order Crocodylia) are an ancient vertebrate group of tremendous ecological,
social, and evolutionary importance. They are the only extant reptilian members of Archosauria, a
monophyletic group that also includes birds, dinosaurs, and pterosaurs. Consequently, crocodilian genomes
represent a gateway through which the molecular evolution of avian lineages can be explored. To facilitate
comparative genomics within Crocodylia and between crocodilians and other archosaurs, we have
constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library for the Australian saltwater crocodile, Crocodylus
porosus. This is the first BAC library for a crocodile and only the second BAC resource for a crocodilian.
Results: The C. porosus BAC library consists of 101,760 individually archived clones stored in 384-well
microtiter plates. NotI digestion of random clones indicates an average insert size of 102 kb. Based on a
genome size estimate of 2778 Mb, the library affords 3.7 fold (3.7×) coverage of the C. porosus genome. To
investigate the utility of the library in studying sequence distribution, probes derived from CR1a and CR1b,
two crocodilian CR1-like retrotransposon subfamilies, were hybridized to C. porosus macroarrays. The results
indicate that there are a minimum of 20,000 CR1a/b elements in C. porosus and that their distribution
throughout the genome is decidedly non-random. To demonstrate the utility of the library in gene isolation,
we probed the C. porosus macroarrays with an overgo designed from a C-mos (oocyte maturation factor) partial
cDNA. A BAC containing C-mos was identified and the C-mos locus was sequenced. Nucleotide and amino acid
sequence alignment of the C. porosus C-mos coding sequence with avian and reptilian C-mos orthologs reveals
greater sequence similarity between C. porosus and birds (specifically chicken and zebra finch) than between C.
porosus and squamates (green anole).
Conclusion: We have demonstrated the utility of the Crocodylus porosus BAC library as a tool in genomics
research. The BAC library should expedite complete genome sequencing of C. porosus and facilitate detailed
analysis of genome evolution within Crocodylia and between crocodilians and diverse amniote lineages
including birds, mammals, and other non-avian reptiles.

Background

Crocodilians, birds, dinosaurs, and pterosaurs form a
monophyletic group known as the Archosauria [5] of
which only the crocodilian and the avian lineages are
extant (Figure 1). In support of this premise, molecular
phylogenetic evidence from nuclear and mitochondrial
DNA sequencing indicates that crocodilians and birds are
indeed each other's closest living relatives [5,6]. Among
archosaurs, only the chicken and zebra finch have been
the focus of complete genome sequencing efforts [7,8].
Genome level analyses of a crocodilian would be especially useful in leveraging information from the chicken,
and a crocodilian genome would be the best possible outgroup for all genomic work within birds. However, with
the modest exception of Alligator mississippiensis for which
there is roughly 2.5 Mb of BAC end sequence [9] and 26
partially assembled BACs (GenBank, 10/3/2008), little
sequence data is available for crocodilian genomes, in part
due to a relative lack of high-quality molecular tools for
this important clade.
For roughly 15 years, bacterial artificial chromosome
(BAC) libraries have been the principal molecular substrate used in physical mapping and complete eukaryote
genome sequencing [10]. Gridding of ordered BAC libraries (i.e., libraries in which each clone is stored in its own
microtiter well) onto macroarrays and multiplex screening techniques have facilitated rapid gene isolation. The
utility of BAC clones as substrates for end sequencing, in
conjunction with advanced DNA fingerprinting techniques and macroarray analysis, has permitted construction of robust physical maps and selection of minimum
tiling paths (i.e., sets of minimally overlapping BAC
clones spanning entire chromosomes or chromosomal
regions) for accurate genome sequencing and assembly.
Recent advances in sequencing technologies (e.g., 454
pyrosequencing, Illumina sequencing, etc.) have created
powerful opportunities in which ordered BAC libraries
play a critical role. A particularly promising strategy for

Crocodilians (Order Crocodylia) are a group of reptiles
that originated roughly 200 million years ago [1,2]. They
are apex predators in the marine and freshwater habitats
in which they reside, and they play a major role in warmwater ecosystems throughout the world. There are 23
extant species grouped into three families – Crocodilidae
(crocodiles), Alligatoridae (alligators and caimans), and
Gavialidae (gharials) [3,4]. As evidenced by their frequent
appearances in video documentaries and television programs, crocodilians are a subject of considerable human
curiosity. Moreover, these reptiles have been common
subjects/characters in mythology, folk tales, art (including
cave paintings and hieroglyphics), and literature suggesting that they have considerable symbolic and practical significance in the lives of humans, past and present.

simultaneous physical mapping and sequencing of large
eukaryotic genomes involves sequencing pools of
sheared, individually "bar coded" BAC clones. After
sequencing, those reads sharing a bar code (i.e., corresponding to the same BAC) are grouped together and
assembled in silico, and physical maps are constructed by
identifying overlapping assembled or partially assembled
BAC sequences [11].
To expedite genome research in crocodilians, we have
constructed a BAC library for the Australian saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus). The C. porosus library is only the
second large-insert DNA library for a crocodilian – a 10×
library exists for Alligator mississippiensis [12] – and the
only BAC library for Crocodilidae, the largest of the croc-

odilian families. C. porosus is the largest living crocodilian
and, along with A. mississippiensis, the only crocodilian
species to be commercially farmed. Here we describe generation and characterization of the C. porosus BAC library
and demonstrate its utility as a tool for gene isolation,
genome characterization, and comparative genomics.

Methods
Preparation of nuclei agarose plugs from crocodile blood
sample
Whole blood was obtained from Errol, a male C. porosus
from the Darwin Crocodile Farm [13] near Darwin, Australia. Blood was suspended in citrate buffer (250 mM
sucrose, 40 mM trisodium citrate, pH 7.6) containing 5%
v/v dimethylsulfoxide, aliquoted into 1.5 ml polypropylene tubes, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and shipped to
the Mississippi Genome Exploration Laboratory [14].
One of the tubes was thawed on ice and centrifuged at
4,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 4 min. The supernatant was decanted, the pellet was gently re-suspended in 1
ml of STEX buffer (100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl, 100
mM EDTA, pH 8.0), and the mixture was centrifuged as
described above. The blood cell pellet was re-suspended
in 500 μl STEX buffer and placed in a water bath at 45°C.
After 15 min, the blood suspension was mixed with an
equal volume of 45°C 2% w/v Cambrex (Rockland, ME)
SeaPlaque Agarose (cat. no. 50100) in STEX buffer. The
mixture was poured into a small Petri dish so that the
depth of the solution was roughly 2 mm. After 20 min at
4°C, the resulting gel was cut into 10 × 5 mm rectangles,
and these "plugs" were transferred into a conical 50 ml
polypropylene tube containing 40 ml of lysis buffer (STEX
buffer containing 1% w/vN-lauroylsarcosine and 300 mg/
ml proteinase K). The capped tube was incubated at 37°C
overnight with gentle agitation. Plugs were transferred
into 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated at 4°C for one hour.
Plugs were washed in 0.5 MEDTA (pH 8.0) and then
stored at 4°C in this buffer.
Preparation of high-molecular-weight insert DNA
A few test DNA plugs were exposed to different HindIII
concentrations to determine conditions providing the
largest number of fragments between 100 to 500 kb [see
[15]]. The optimal enzyme concentration as determined
in the test digests was used in a large-scale partial digest.
Plugs used in the mass digestion were macerated and
placed in a slot well of a 1% w/v Cambrex SeaKem Gold
Agarose (cat. no. 50150) gel in 0.25 × TBE buffer (22.5
mM Tris, 22.5 mM boric acid, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Size
selection of partially digested DNA was performed using
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) according to Chalhoub et al. [16]. Size-selected HindIII fragments between
100 and 500 kb were recovered from agarose by electroelution according to Peterson et al. [15].

BAC library construction
BAC library construction was performed as described in
Peterson et al. [15] using the pIndigoBAC-5 vector (Epicentre, Madison WI) and ElectroMAX DH10B T1 PhageResistant Competent Cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Clone picking and library replication were performed
using a Genetix QPixII robot (New Milton, Hampshire,
UK). To monitor the quality of the BAC library and determine mean insert size, 96 BAC clones from every fiftieth
384-well plate were evaluated by NotI digestion and
PFGE. For these analyses BAC DNA was isolated using an
AutoGenprep 960 robot (AutoGen, Holliston, MA).
Macroarray construction
High density macroarrays were prepared using a Genetix
QPixII robot. Each array consisted of 18,432 double-spotted BAC clones stamped onto a 22.5 cm2 Hybond N+ filter
(GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). There were enough C.
porosus BAC clones to produce five complete macroarrays
(101,760 clones ÷ 18,432 clones/macroarray = 5.52).
Stamped arrays were placed clone-side up on LB (LuriaBertani) agar containing 12.5 mg/L chloramphenicol and
incubated at 37°C overnight. Each macroarray was fixed
via incubation in 0.5 N NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl for 7 min followed by incubation in 1.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M Tris Cl for 7
min. The membranes were allowed to air dry for 1 h,
treated with 0.4 N NaOH for 20 min, and washed in 5×
SSPE (0.75 M NaCl, 50 mM Na2HPO4, 5 mM EDTA, pH
7.4) for 7 min. Macroarrays were air dried and stored in
sealed plastic bags.
Probe design and BAC library screening
Overgo probes [17] were designed from the consensus
sequences of CR1a and CR1b (see Additional File 1, Table
S1), two recently active CR1 subfamilies present in the
genomes of Crocodylus moreletii and Osteolaemus tetraspis
(D. Ray, unpublished data), and from a partial cDNA
sequence of the C. porosus C-mos gene [GenBank:AF478196]. The overgos (Table 1) were labeled with
32P and hybridized to macroarrays as previously described
[18,19]. Probe hybridization images were recorded and
analyzed using a Storm 820 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway,
NJ) phosphoimager. For the CR1-probed macroarrays, the
spot densitometry tool in AlphaEaseFC, Version 3.3.0
(Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA) was used to explore
variation in spot (clone hybridization) intensity and estimate copy number as described previously [20]. Positive
C-mos clones were confirmed by PCR using the CMF1/
CMR1 primer pair (Table 1). PCR was performed using
the following thermocycler series: 95°C denaturation for
5 min, 34 full PCR cycles (94°C for 1 min, 50°C for 1
min, and 72°C for 1.5 min), and a final 72°C 10 min
extension step.

Subcloning and sequencing of the C. porosus C-mos gene
A BAC clone containing the C. porosus C-mos gene was
digested with BamHI and HindIII at 37°C for 1 hr followed by heating to 65°C for 10 min. The cloning vector
pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was likewise
double-digested, purified by electrophoresis on a 1% w/v
agarose gel, and isolated from agarose using a Qiagen
(Valencia, CA) QiaQuick Gel Extraction kit. Ligation was
performed at 16°C for 16 hrs. The ligation mixture was
used to transform chemically competent Invitrogen
(Carlsbad, CA) One Shot TOP10 cells according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Subclones were plated and
40 were screened by PCR using the C-mos primers CMF1
and CMR1 (Table 1). One positive subclone, which was
shown by gel electrophoresis to contain a 3.7 kb insert,
was sent to SeqWright (Houston, TX) for cycle sequencing
using the CMF1 and CMR1 primers and two additional
primers (CMF2 and CMR2 – Table 1). Use of a combination of primers was intended to extend the target area so
that it would encompass the entire C-mos coding sequence
and several hundred bases 5' and 3' of the coding region.
Base-calling and assembly of sequence reads were performed using Phred and Phrap, respectively [21-23].
Trimming of the assembled C-mos sequence was conducted using Cross_Match [23]. The 3576 bp product was
submitted to GenBank and assigned the accession
FJ011695.

BAC library represents 10.2 Gb of crocodile genomic DNA
[i.e., 101,760 clones•102 kb/clone•(1–0.013) = 10.2 Gb].
The exact genome size of C. porosus is unknown. However,
measurements made for two other Crocodylus species (C.
siamensis and C. niloticus) [24] are both 2778 Mb. Assuming the C. porosus genome size is similar to those of these
closely allied taxa, we estimate that the library affords 3.7×
coverage (i.e., 10.2 Gb ÷ 2778 Mb = 3.7) of the C. porosus
genome. Theoretically, this level of coverage affords 98%
probability of finding any given genomic sequence at least
once in the library [25].
Survey of CR1 elements in crocodile genome
CR1 elements are non-LTR retrotransposons existing in
high copy numbers in bird and reptile genomes [26-28];
there are about 100,000 CR1 elements in the chicken
genome [26]. CR1 retrotransposons are considered excellent markers for molecular phylogenetic and population
genetic studies [29,30]. Initial studies on the sequences
from the 21 BAC clones of Alligator mississippiensis availa-

Results and discussion
BAC library coverage
The C. porosus BAC library consists of 101,760 individual
clones stored in 265 bar-coded 384-well microtiter plates.
NotI digestion and PFGE of 768 BAC clones indicates an
average clone insert size of 102 kb (Figure 2) with 70.5%
of clones possessing inserts > 100 kb, 24.2% with inserts
between 50 and 100 kb, and 5.3% with inserts smaller
than 50 kb. Internal NotI sites are present in 41.6% of
PFGE-examined BAC clones (Figure 2), and 1.3% of
clones are probable false positives, i.e., they possess a vector band but no insert band(s). Collectively, the entire

AC149025.3, AC148578.2, AC149029.2, AC149026.2,
AC148964.2, and AC149027.1] revealed that at least two
CR1 subfamilies, referred to here as CR1a and CR1b, have
recently been active in crocodilian genomes. This observation is consistent with Shedlock et al. (2007) in which the
authors suggested that multiple CR1 lineages may have
been active in alligators. In addition to A. mississippiensis,
CR1a and CR1b have been identified in Crocodylus moreletii, and Osteolaemus tetraspis (D. Ray, unpublished) and
consensus sequences for conserved regions of these elements have been generated (see Additional File 1, Table
S1).
To explore CR1 distribution in C. porosus, macroarrays
were screened with CR1b-derived overgos or a combination of CR1a and CR1b overgos. Comparison of the
CR1b- and CR1a/b-probed macroarrays revealed that the
CR1a and CR1b subfamilies are not distinguishable in our
assay, i.e., virtually no differences in hybridization pattern
and intensity were observed when comparing the CR1b
and CR1a/CR1b filters (data not shown). It was clear,
however, that elements similar to CR1a and b are fairly
abundant in C. porosus. Examination of one-quarter of the
CR1a/b-probed macroarray (Figure 3A) indicates that
8.9% of clones show hybridization to the CR1a/b overgos
while CR1b overgo hybridization to a filter stamped with
the contents of a single 384-well plate from the BAC
library suggests that 12.8% of clones (49 of 384) are positive for the CR1b overgo (Figure 4). Densitometric analysis of the macroarray reveals that there is a six-fold
variation in positive clone hybridization intensity. If the
lightest, but clearly positive hybridization signals represent clones containing one copy of a CR1a/b element and
if the darkest clones contain six elements, there would be
approximately 19,754 copies of CR1a/b in the C. porosus
genome [see [20] for calculation method]. However, there
is the possibility that macroarray exposure conditions
were such that only clones with multiple copies of CR1a/
b elements appear positive; inclusion of a single-copy
sequence control on the macroarray could be used to test
this possibility. Moreover, the use of overgos (each pair
representing only 36 bp) rather than whole CR1
sequences clearly limits hybridization to those elements
where the regions corresponding to the overgos have been
conserved. Based on analysis of 2.5 Mb of BAC end
sequence, Shedlock [9] estimated the number of CR1 elements in Alligator mississippiensis at 408,000 copies. While
A. mississippiensis and C. porosus are separated by 100 million years of evolution [31], it seems reasonable that they
might have similar total numbers of CR1 elements. Consequently, the C. porosus copy number estimate of 19,754

should be viewed as a minimum number of CR1a/b elements, not total CR1 elements, in the C. porosus genome.
Statistical analysis of the macroarray data indicates that
CR1a/b elements are not randomly distributed throughout the C. porosus genome. The macroarray contains
18,432 individual clones with an average insert size of
102 kb. Consequently, a single macroarray represents
roughly 0.68 genome equivalents, i.e., (18,432•102 kb) ÷
2778 Mb. If the crocodile genome contains 19,754 copies
of CR1a/b, then we would expect approximately 13,369
copies of CR1a/b per macroarray, and if these were dis-

tributed randomly we would expect, on average, 0.73 copies of CR1a/b per clone. However, only 8.9% of clones on
the macroarray show hybridization to the CR1a/b probes.
To test whether such a distribution is likely by chance, we
can formulate the problem as a statistical "urn model."
Suppose we have 18,432 urns, and we drop 13,369 balls
into them at random. In such a case, classical statistical
asymptotic theory [32] describes the distribution of the
number of occupied (or empty) urns. In this experiment
we found 1,203 occupied and 17,229 empty urns. The
null and alternative hypotheses are as follows:

384-well plate believed to contain the clone of interest.
Blot hybridization using the C-mos overgo probes verified
that the plate and well address obtained from the filter
were correct (Figure 4). The duplicate filter was probed
with the CR1b overgos. Of note, the C-mos positive clone
shows no visible hybridization with the CR1b sequence
(Figure 4). PCR with the CMF1 and CMR1 primers was
used to independently verify the presence of the C-mos
locus in the positive BAC clone.

A project is underway that will involve sequencing some
CR1 positive BAC clones from C.porosus so that we may
(among other things) compare the structure and distribution of CR1 elements in the Alligator and Crocodylus
genomes. The sequence data can then be used for evolutionary analyses among crocodilians, birds, and nonarchosaur reptiles.

The C. porosus C-mos gene
Subcloning was used to isolate a 3.7 kb region containing
the C-mos locus. Cycle sequencing using the CMF1, CMF2,
CMR1, and CMR2 primers (Table 1) and assembly of the
reads resulted in production of a continuous 3,576 bp
sequence [GenBank:FJ011695]. This sequence contains
the entire coding sequence (CDS) for C-mos as well as >
1000 bp upstream and downstream of the CDS. Like most
characterized C-mos sequences [35], C. porosus C-mos possesses a single ORF. The ORF, which starts at base 1313
and ends with the stop codon TGA (bases 2366–2368),
codes for a 351 amino acid protein. Alignment of the C.
porosus C-mos CDS with those of chicken, zebra finch, and
green anole orthologs (see Additional File 1, Figures S1
and S2 for alignments) reveals considerable nucleotide
and amino acid conservation (Table 2). Interestingly, the
C. porosus CDS is six nucleotides (2 amino acids) longer
than the chicken, zebra finch, and green anole C-mos
genes. These two additional amino acids are adjacent to
each other and are located at the C-terminal end of the C.
porosus C-mos protein (see Additional File 1, Figures S1
and S2).

Identification of a crocodile C-mos gene containing BAC
clone
A randomly selected macroarray was hybridized with the
C-mos overgos (Table 1), and fortuitously one of the
18,432 double-spotted clones on the array exhibited a
positive signal (Figure 3). The plate and well address of
the clone was determined based upon the macroarray
number, the location of the positive signal on the macroarray, and the spatial relationship between the two
spots [see [34]]. To make sure that the correct clone was
identified, a hand-held plate gridding/replicating device
was used to stamp two nylon filters with the clones in the

Crocodilian sequence and comparative genomics
Comparative genomics research is a burgeoning field with
high potential to increase our understanding of the structure, function, and evolution behind the diversity of life.
However, the primary focus of most efforts over the past
several years has been on comparisons among mammals.
For example, Miller et al. recently created a 28-way alignment of available vertebrate genomes in which only eight
taxa, Gallus, Anolis, Xenopus and five fish represent the
entirety of non-mammalian vertebrates. Understanding
the evolution and interrelationships among all amnotes
will be severely hindered by this lack of diversity. Ongoing

H0: The allocation is completely random;
HA: Not H0.
Under H0, the number of empty urns is (approximately)
normally distributed with mean 8,924 and standard deviation ≈ 40 [33] (verified both theoretically and by simulation), so the observed number of empty urns (i.e., 17,229)
is more than 200 standard deviations above the mean,
and hence is almost impossible under H0 (the formal pvalue is zero to 32 decimal places). We therefore conclude
that the distribution of CR1a/b is non-random.

projects to sequence the green anole (Sqamata) and the
painted turtle (Chelonia) will help correct the disparity
but one significant lineage of the amniote tree remains to
be addressed – Crocodylia. It is our hope that the generation of this library will facilitate genomics research in this
critical lineage.

Conclusion

References

We have constructed a high quality 3.7× BAC library for
Crocodylus porosus and demonstrated the library's utility as
a genomics tool. We are currently screening the library
with other genes and repeat sequences as a means of
investigating the structure of the Australian saltwater crocodile genome and facilitating comparative genomics
research among archosaurs. Copies of the BAC library,
individual clones, and macroarrays can be obtained from
the Mississippi Genome Exploration Laboratory [14].

The project was conceived through discussions between
DGP and DAR. XS constructed the BAC library and performed all bench research in the lab of DGP. Experiments
were designed by XS with the input of DGP and DAR. DAR
provided sequence data for CR1 analyses of the library
and made arrangements associated with acquisition of
crocodile blood. JAB performed the statistical analysis
associated with CR1 distribution. All authors were
involved in manuscript writing and editing. The final version of the manuscript was read and approved by all
authors.
