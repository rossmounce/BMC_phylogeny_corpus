Abstract
Background: While more than 700 microRNAs (miRNAs) are known in human, a comparably low number has been
identified in swine. Because of the close phylogenetic distance to humans, pigs serve as a suitable model for studying
e.g. intestinal development or disease. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are key regulators of intestinal
development and their aberrant expression leads to intestinal malignancy.
Results: Here, we present the identification of hundreds of apparently novel miRNAs in the porcine intestine. MiRNAs
were first identified by means of deep sequencing followed by miRNA precursor prediction using the miRDeep
algorithm as well as searching for conserved miRNAs. Second, the porcine miRNAome along the entire intestine
(duodenum, proximal and distal jejunum, ileum, ascending and transverse colon) was unraveled using customized
miRNA microarrays based on the identified sequences as well as known porcine and human ones. In total, the
expression of 332 intestinal miRNAs was discovered, of which 201 represented assumed novel porcine miRNAs. The
identified hairpin forming precursors were in part organized in genomic clusters, and most of the precursors were
located on chromosomes 3 and 1, respectively. Hierarchical clustering of the expression data revealed subsets of
miRNAs that are specific to distinct parts of the intestine pointing to their impact on cellular signaling networks.
Conclusions: In this study, we have applied a straight forward approach to decipher the porcine intestinal miRNAome
for the first time in mammals using a piglet model. The high number of identified novel miRNAs in the porcine
intestine points out their crucial role in intestinal function as shown by pathway analysis. On the other hand, the
reported miRNAs may share orthologs in other mammals such as human still to be discovered.
Background
One of the basic requirements for the development of
higher taxa in animal phylogeny was the acquisition of
complex gene regulatory networks. Besides alternative
splicing, RNA interference (RNAi) is recognized to be
one of the key regulators of the post-transcriptional
eukaryotic gene expression. Animal miRNAs (~ 22 nucleotides) belong to the class of endogenous small interfering non-coding RNAs. They direct the regulation of gene
expression by binding partially complementary target
sites in the 3' untranslated regions (3'UTR) of mRNAs [1].
It was noticed early that especially the 5' end of miRNAs
is important for the binding of target mRNAs [2], in particular nucleotides 2-8, sometimes referred to as the

'seed' [3]. MiRNAs have been identified in numerous vertebrates including primates, rodents and fish but also in
invertebrates e.g. worms and flies as well as in viruses [4].
A large number of miRNAs is highly conserved among
related species indicating their role in crucial cellular processes such as stress adaption and hormone signaling [5].
During evolution more and more miRNA families were
added to metazoan genomes and once incorporated into
regulatory networks, few shifts of the mature sequence
have occurred. These observations led to the hypothesis
that morphological complexity is in part directed by the
acquisition of new miRNA families during animal phylogeny [6,7]. While several hundreds of human miRNAs
are known, limited data sets are available for other species. According to miRBase Release 14.0 [8], the number
of noted human and murine miRNAs exceeds 700 and
500, respectively. Beside these species, the coverage of the
miRNAome from other mammals e.g. pig remains scarce.

To date 77 porcine miRNA sequences have been deposited in miRBase Release 14.0 and recently 96 novel and
conserved mature miRNAs were identified in a porcine
tissue pool while only 11 precursor molecules were identified [9]. Another recent study also based on searching
for conserved miRNAs resulted in 162 identified precursors in swine skeletal muscle [10].
Besides their importance in livestock production, pigs
are of particular biomedical interest because of their phylogenetic relation to humans. In this context and because
human intestinal samples are limited and valuable tissue
is only available after ileostomies or colonoscopies,
rodents have been introduced as common models for
human gastrointestinal studies. But limitations like differences in intestinal morphology, enteric microbiota, body
mass, life span and different food intake raise concerns
about the suitability of the rodent model. Obvious differences between mammals concerning the degree of intestinal maturation at birth should be taken into account.
Rodents are born after a short gestation period with a
premature intestinal tract. In contrast, pigs are born after
a long gestation showing advanced intestinal development at birth. Therefore, pigs are closer to human intestinal development during fetal and neonatal periods [11].
In addition, the porcine anatomy and the physiology of
digestion are very comparable to those of humans [12]
favoring the piglet model as a suitable animal model to
investigate human gastrointestinal diseases [13,14] and to
understand signaling pathways related to mucosal development. For example, a piglet model of dextran sodium
sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis was used to successfully
evaluate mucosal immunity and therapeutic responses in
patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [15].
Apart from Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC)
is one of the major idiopathic IBD. Interestingly, Wu and
colleagues have recently shown that miRNAs are dysregulated in humans with UC. While three miRNAs showed
significantly decreased expression, eight others were significantly increased in patients with UC [16]. However, to
better investigate and understand regulatory networks of
such exemplified diseases in the porcine model, a deeper
coverage of the intestinal miRNAome is needed. Recently,
we have reported 10 novel porcine miRNAs after introduction of a new concatameric cloning strategy [17].
Deep sequencing enables the immediate generation of a
vast number of sequence data. As a proof of principle that
deep sequencing can be used to discover hundreds of
novel miRNAs from a single sample, we have introduced
a method based on downstream sequence analysis using
the algorithm miRDeep to detect ~ 200 previously unannotated canine miRNAs [18]. Thus, next generation
sequencing methods provide the opportunity for detect-

ing miRNA molecules at an unrivalled depth. In this
study, we have applied deep sequencing followed by bioinformatical analysis of the acquired data to discover
novel porcine miRNAs from a pool of porcine intestinal
samples. After identification of novel porcine miRNAs
including their precursors, the intestinal miRNAome was
deciphered along the entire porcine intestinal tract
including duodenum, proximal and distal jejunum, ileum,
ascending and transverse colon.

Results
Deep sequencing unravels the expression of more than 300
potential porcine intestinal miRNAs

We have applied deep sequencing to analyze the expression of regulating miRNAs in the porcine intestine. For
this purpose, a total RNA pool of samples from distal
jejunum and ileum of four piglets at the age of 31 days
was established in equal shares.
In total 5,745,733 reads were generated by deep
sequencing of the small RNA fraction (20-30 nt). Of those
1,422,397 reads mapped to the pig genome perfectly.
After specific selection (see material and methods section) of eligible reads, miRNA predictions were made
using miRDeep, an algorithm to identify known and
novel miRNAs in deep sequencing data. miRDeep uses
the mapped reads as guidelines for excising potential
miRNA hairpins from the genome. Each hairpin is
assigned a score, which reflects the probability that the
hairpin is a genuine miRNA precursor [18]. Altogether,
399 were scored by miRDeep and chosen for further analysis, of which 103 were known miRNAs (according to
miRBase 14.0 and Nielsen et al. 2009). 354 hairpins were
reported by miRDeep passing the cut-off score of -3, of
which 140 were estimated to be false positives, representing a signal to noise ratio of 2.5. Hairpin forming precursors (including the flanking region) predicted by
miRDeep exhibited low minimal free energies (mfe) ranging between -67.4 and -21.5 kcal/mol (Additional file 1).
The hairpin structures of eight precursor sequences are
exemplified in Figure 1 (for detailed information about all
predicted hairpin forming precursors see Additional file
1). Among them were novel porcine miRNAs (Figure 1,
H) that possessed low or no conservation among other
mammals but also four putative viral miRNAs. Because of
the imperfect coverage of the pig genome assembly an
additional search of conserved mammalian miRNAs was
performed. This approach yielded 119 porcine mature
miRNA candidates that did not map to the pig genome
assembly and 18 mature miRNA candidates that did map
to the genome but had not been reported by miRDeep.
Blast searches against known miRNAs (miRBase 14.0 and

Nielsen et al. 2009) revealed 20 novel and conserved
mature miRNAs (for details see Additional file 2).
Microarray experiments verify the expression of 194 novel
miRNAs

We have used the newly identified potential miRNA
sequences as well as known porcine and human miRNA
sequences to perform the first miRNAome analysis along
the entire intestinal tract of a mammalian organism by
using customized microarrays (febit biomed GmbH,
Heidelberg, Germany). This approach served also as verification of miRDeep predicted data. Pooled samples from
different intestinal loci (duodenum, proximal and distal
jejunum, ileum, ascending and transverse colon) of four
healthy 31 days old piglets were subjected to miRNA
microarray analysis. MIAME-compliant data relative to
the applied platforms as well as processed and raw sample
data were submitted to the NCBI GEO repository [19]
and accession-numbers were assigned (platform and
samples for miRDeep predicted probes: platform,
GPL9724; duodenum, GSM501150; proximal jejunum,
GSM501151; distal jejunum, GSM501152; ileum,
GSM501153; ascending colon, GSM501154; transverse
colon, GSM501155; common reference, GSM501156;
platform and samples for human samples including porcine conserved mature miRNA: platform, GPL9724; duodenum, GSM501118; proximal jejunum, GSM501119;
distal jejunum, GSM501120; ileum, GSM501121; ascending colon, GSM501122; transverse colon, GSM501123;
common reference, GSM501124). For selection of highly
reliable expression data and validation of the miRDeep
prediction, we decided to apply a stringent selection
strategy. The predicted mature as well as relating star
sequences were synthesized in seven replicates on a febit
biochip. After background subtraction and variance stabilizing normalization (VSN) of array data, only expression values of mature sequences higher than 7 were
considered. This threshold is chosen as a cut-off for
selecting bona fide signals. From the eliminated data also
those were considered with a signal intensity of the star
sequence higher than 7. In our microarray experiments,
we detected 31 miRNAs showing consistently higher signal intensities of their star strands compared with the
predicted mature molecules (Additional file 3). After
choosing this high level of quality assurance by simultaneous detection of the mature as well as star sequence we
have verified the expression of 194 miRDeep predicted
mature miRNAs. We considered another 7 sequences as
genuine miRNAs, which showed no signal on microarrays but were conserved among animals. Consequently,
we have identified 201 apparently novel porcine miRNAs
out of 399 miRDeep predicted sequences (Additional file
3). As mentioned above 354 predicted precursors possessed a score above the cut-off -3, of which an estimated

Page 4 of 14

140 were false positives. According to the microarray
experiments, we have identified 95 false positive miRNAs
representing a signal to noise ratio of 4.2 and underlining
the robustness of the miRDeep prediction.
By regarding also the identified conserved mature miRNAs not covered by miRDeep and the known porcine
sequences deposited in miRBase, we have verified the
expression of 332 miRNAs expressed in the porcine intestine including 201 apparently novel porcine miRNAs (194
miRDeep predicted plus seven conserved mature miRNAs) corresponding to 61% (Figure 2A). Taken together,
between 204 (proximal jejunum) and 183 (ascending
colon) miRNAs were found to be expressed in different
intestinal loci, while the percentage of novel porcine
miRNA varied between 53 and 68% depending on the
locus analyzed (Figure 2A and Additional file 4).
A high number of analyzed miRNAs showed overlapping expression in morphologically related intestinal loci
shown by the Venn diagrams in Figure 3A-C. There was
an overlapping expression of 130 miRNAs in distal jejunum and ileum (including the common reference) corresponding to 71% and 70% of totally expressed miRNAs in
distal jejunum and ileum, respectively (Figure 3B). Consistent expression was also determined in both colonic

loci, 124 miRNAs were expressed both in transverse and
ascending colon representing 65% and 67% of regarding
totally expressed miRNA (Figure 3C). For comparative
expression analysis among the intestinal loci, we have
applied the strategy of using a common reference representing a pool of all samples. As shown in Figure 3D, 93
miRNAs showed ubiquitous expression in all loci including the common reference. For evaluation of comprehensive microarray data and to allow for comparison of
spatial miRNA expression, we have calculated the log
ratios of those 93 miRNAs for every locus and their counterparts from the common reference. In consistence with
the Venn diagrams, hierarchical clustering of both genes
and samples revealed similar expression profiles in morphologically related intestinal tissues. Both colonic loci
clustered together, they formed a superior group with the
distal jejunum and ileum while duodenum and proximal
jejunum clustered together (figure 3E). At the gene level
we have identified several clusters, while five of which
were of particular interest. Cluster I (Figure 3E) shown in
the hierarchically clustered heatmap harbored only miR194 and miR-215, which were highly expressed in the
proximal parts of the small intestine (duodenum and
proximal jejunum). Consequently, we searched for predicted targets using Targetscan [20] and subjected the
outcome to pathway analysis using the tool DAVID [21]
and considering the affected BioCarta and KEGG pathways. This revealed that these miRNAs seem to have an
impact mainly on pathways that determine cellular differentiation and proliferation such as TGF-beta, ErbB, insulin and mTOR signaling pathways. Cluster II consisted of
miR-214 and MDM288 showing increased levels of
expression in both colonic loci. The downstream analysis
indicated that cell cycle determining pathways such as
Cyclin E and E2F destruction pathways but also cell to
cell adhesion signaling were affected by these miRNAs.
Cluster III harbored miRNAs that show ubiquitously high
expression along the intestine. Two other clusters of miRNAs showed a decreased or increased expression in distal
jejunum and ileum, respectively (Figure 3E, IV & V). The
first one harbored known miRNAs such as miR-26a, miR27a, miR-125b, miR-130a and miR-145 but the latter was
mainly composed of novel and not conserved miRNAs.
The miRNAs outlined in cluster V have predominant
impact on intracellular signaling pathways such as
MAPK/ERK, Notch and Wnt signaling but also on Mets
affected macrophage differentiation and p53 signaling
pathway.
In addition four miRNAs were identified, which partly
matched known viral miRNAs. MDM133, 154, 329 and
335 may represent novel porcine specific viral miRNAs
being partly identical to hsv1-miR-H1, rrv-miR-rR1-4,
mdv2-miR-M18-5p and mdv2-miR-M30, respectively
(data not shown). While MDM154 and MDM335 were

Page 6 of 14

expressed along the entire intestine, MDM329 was only
detected in proximal jejunum and the expression of
MDM133 was below the detection limit (Figure 3E).
In our microarray approach we also included known
human miRNAs obtained from miRBase 13.0 allowing
also a heterologous approach between human probes and
porcine miRNAs. After selecting the miRNAs being
expressed in all loci including the common reference, we
have identified 66 miRNAs, which were chosen for clustering analysis as described above. Interestingly, there
was consistent clustering of intestinal samples, as
described for the homologous approach above. All
related intestinal parts clustered together, while in concordance to the homologous approach the colon and the
distal parts of the small intestine formed a superior cluster (Figure 4). Conserved miRNAs showed comparable
expression patterns and clustering revealed consistency
between both approaches, e.g. miR-126, miR-24 and miR22 were combined in the same cluster and together with
miR-16, miR-21 and let-7d showed increased expression
in colon compared with other loci (Figure 4). After selecting miRNAs with consistent signal detection i.e. with
overlapping detection in the homologous and heterologous approach (discarding of porcine specific sequences),
13 miRNAs were selected for correlation analysis
between both approaches. The Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated depending on the locus and were
between 0.7235 in duodenum and 0.9332 in ascending
colon (p < 0.0001). The global Pearson correlation coefficient calculated from all loci was 0.7468 (p < 0.0001). The
calculated local as well as general coefficients pointed to
high linearity between both approaches (Table 1).
Identified porcine miRNAs are chromosomally duplicated
and partly clustered

After comparative expression analysis among the intestinal loci, we were interested if and how the identified
miRNA precursors are organized within the porcine
genome.
Therefore, we firstly sorted out only miRDeep predicted novel precursors whose expression was validated
by microarray experiments in any of the intestinal parts
or which were conserved among animals, respectively.
Thereby, we have identified 201 apparently novel porcine
miRNAs (Additional file 3). To find out the genomic location and organization of the identified precursors,
sequences were blasted against the porcine high throughput genomic sequence (HTGS) database at NCBI http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/BlastGen/BlastGen.cgi?taxid=9823. As shown in Figure 2B, the chromosomal location of 86% of the identified miRNAs was
determined. Most of the precursors were located on the
chromosomes 3 followed by chromosome 1 (9 and 8%)
and only 1% was organized in the chromosome 18 and 11,

respectively. The chromosomal location of 14% of the
precursors was not determined. Detailed information on
genomic organization of the identified miRNAs is given
in the Additional file 3. In addition to the identified
genomic duplications and clustering of miRNAs, we were
able to predict alternative precursors for the same mature
miRNA (Table 2). Interestingly, miR-194 and miR-215
were both duplicated and located on chromosomes X and
10 and clustered within a 353 bp chromosomal region.
Alignment of duplicated chromosomal regions revealed
100% identity of the nucleotide sequence (data not
shown). The secondary structure analysis of this chromosomal site including both precursors revealed another
hairpin structure, which was not covered by miRDeep
and possessed the conserved seed of miR-488 (data not
shown). The precursor of miR-421, for example, was
located on chromosome X and was clustered with the
known miRNA ssc-miR-374a within a distance of 107 bp,
while no obvious hairpin was detected in between (Table
2). As shown in Table 2, joining hairpin forming precursors were predicted for several miRNAs. For example,
two alternative hairpin forming precursors were predicted for the miRNA with internal IDs MDM238 and
MDM392 (an ortholog of mmu-miR-2145). Both possessed low mfe (-34.8 and -28.8 kcal/mol) and were
located within a fragment of 101 bp on chromosome 2
and may represent two alternative dicer substrates (Table
2 and Figure 1B and 1C).

Discussion
Pigs represent an important model for biomedical
research to study human disease, development or nutrition. As introduced, the porcine gastrointestinal model
provides several benefits over other animal models such
as rodents. Like humans, pigs are omnivorous implying
very similar principles of the physiology of digestion and
associated metabolic processes [12,22]. In mammals, the
principal internal interaction between host and microor-

ganisms or other antigens takes place in the intestinal
tract. Because of the morphological as well as physiological similarities particularly the piglet intestinal model is
suitable to study gastrointestinal disease both in adults
and infants [13,14,23]. It is known that cellular differentiation is governed by miRNAs, for example it was recently
shown that miR-145 directs the intestinal development in
Danio rerio [24]. Moreover, Monzo and colleagues found
a correlation between the miRNA expression profiles in
human embryonic colonic mucosa and colorectal carcinoma. They found that the miR-17-92 cluster regulates
cell proliferation pointing to the important role both in
embryonic intestinal development and aberration of this
epithelium [25].
In our study a model of weanling piglets at the age of 31
days has been used. As we have discussed in an earlier
study, there are two waves of antigen exposure in a newborn mammalian organism: directly after birth and at
weaning. The second is rated as an important period in
the intestinal development that is characterized by massive exposure to food and microbial antigens followed by
architectural reorganization of the small intestine [26]. It
was reviewed that beneath the changes along the horizontal intestinal axis pronounced changes occur in the
vertical axis (from crypts to villi) during intestinal development. This represents a gradient replacement of the
cells of an immature phenotype with other cells that differ e.g. in transport functions. These changes are related
to the rate of cellular turnover because there is a slow cell
replacement at birth while an increase takes place at
weaning together with a decrease of enterocyte lifespan
[11]. Since miRNAs are key regulators of cellular proliferation and differentiation, we hypothesize that the weaning phase is accompanied by massive regulation of
specific miRNAs governing the reorganization of the
intestinal cellular response. Moreover, the randomization
of our approach by using RNA pools of four piglets mini-

Alternatively predicted precursors

The chromosomal organization of selected miRNAs that were identified by miRDeep either showing valid expression in microarray experiments or being conserved was determined by blasting
against the porcine HTGS database at NCBI. Identified genomic duplications, clustering and alternatively predicted precursors are shown. Abbreviation: ND, not determined

mizes the bias in the miRNAome by possible biological
variation.
In an earlier study, we have identified several porcine
miRNAs applying a novel cloning strategy based on synthesis of concatamers [17] followed by expression profiling using a miRNA specific quantitative PCR approach
[27]. Here a more straight forward approach was chosen
based on new technologies to generate comprehensive
data in a less time consuming manner. The validation of
sequence data by means of customized microarray
expression profiling allowed us not only to verify the generated porcine data, but also to include known human
miRNA sequences. Since miRNA sequence data are not
available in depth for all mammals, heterologous hybridization approaches may be the only alternative to perform
expression studies in less common species. Supporting
results from an earlier study [28] and the remarkable correlations between the heterologous (human probes versus
porcine samples) and the homologous approach presented here, show that in phylogenetically close species
the heterologous approach may be considered as a suitable alternative. However, the high number of novel and
potentially porcine specific miRNAs discovered in this
study argues against a heterologous approach.
We have identified several genomic clusters one of
those including the porcine miRNAs miR-194 and miR215. Braun and colleagues [29] have reported that these
miRNAs also belong to a human cluster, which is induced
by the tumor suppressor p53. It was shown that miR-192,
miR-194 and miR-215 are highly expressed in normal
colon tissue while their expression is dramatically
decreased in colon cancer. They conclude that these miRNAs seem to suppress cancerogenesis through p21 accumulation and cell cycle arrest. In another recent study,
Hino et al. [30] published that human miR-194 expression is induced by the transcription factor HNF-1α promoting intestinal epithelial differentiation. They
identified two genomic clusters in the human genome
either encoding miR-194-1 and miR-215 on chromosome
1 or encoding miR-194-2 and miR-192 on chromosome
11 [30]. In contrast to human, both porcine clusters are
100% identical encoding only miR-194 and miR-215. In
our microarray experiments, miR-194 and miR-215
showed the same expression pattern along the entire
intestine, underlining the fact that both may derive from
one transcript. However, the expression was highest in
duodenum and proximal jejunum compared with other
loci. These results are in good concordance with the data
derived from human studies. On the one hand, reorganization of the intestine at weaning is associated with high
proliferative activity contributing to an increase in crypt
depth and villus height [11]. Consistently, in distal parts
of the intestine we determined diminished expression of
miR-194 and miR-215, respectively pointing to a higher

Page 11 of 14

proliferative activity in the distal parts. On the other
hand, in the proximal parts of the small intestine particularly a high level of differentiation rather than proliferation takes place at weaning in order to adapt to the new
nutritional conditions by acquiring new transport functions. The pathway analysis revealed mainly cell signaling
networks to be affected that control differentiation e.g.
the mTOR pathway. In addition to regulating cell growth
and proliferation, this pathway was reported to promote
epithelial morphogenesis and differentiation in vertebrates [31]. Consequently, increased expression of miR194 and miR-215 in duodenum and proximal jejunum are
probably involved in promoting epithelial differentiation
in order to replace cells that differ e.g. in transport functions.
Our microarray experiments moreover revealed
miRNA clusters expressed ubiquitously in all intestinal
loci and others, which are locus specific. The gene cluster
composed of MDM288 and miR-214 belongs to the latter
and was identified to be upregulated in both colonic loci.
The pathway analysis of this particular cluster indicated
an impact of these two miRNAs on cell cycle regulation.
Accordingly, miR-214 expression was recently shown to
be directly linked to cell cycle rate. Decembrini and colleagues showed that miR-214 is one of four miRNAs that
are highly expressed in fast cycling retinal progenitors in
Xenopus governing cell fate decision and developmental
timing [32]. In addition to miR-214 and MDM288, miR19b, miR-23a, miR-24, miR-30b possessed increased
expression in colon compared with other parts of the porcine intestine. Interestingly, in another epithelial cell
model it was shown that miR-19, miR-23 and miR-24
contribute to lower cell growth when inhibited [33].
These miRNAs seem to be part of a colonic cellular network promoting physiological cell turnover in colon during weaning as discussed above. The porcine intestinal
lymphoid tissue comprises two types of Peyer's patches:
multiple discrete patches in the jejunum and a long and
continuous patch in the ileum [22]. Interestingly, porcine
miRNAs highly expressed in these loci (cluster V) may
target immune cell differentiation shown by pathway
analysis, e.g via targeting the Notch and Wnt signaling. It
was recently shown that activation of Notch signaling
promotes differentiation of conventional dendritic cells
from hematopoietic progenitor cells via activation of the
Wnt pathway [34]. The mentioned miRNAs seem also to
influence mucosal innate immunity by affecting the antiproliferative functions of PE-1/METS in macrophage differentiation. The concerted action of emphasized miRNAs and other identified local clusters described here
represents the first milestone to understand the complex
gene regulation in the developing intestine of a mammal
with a close phylogenetical relation to humans.

Conclusions
Here, we report the first comprehensive miRNA expression analysis along the entire intestine of a mammal. A
considerable number of the reported miRNAs expressed
in the porcine intestine show low conservation among
mammals. These miRNAs may be regarded as porcine
specific. On the other hand, the reported miRNAs may
share orthologs in other mammals such as human still to
be discovered. Our microarray experiments along the
entire intestine revealed different clusters of miRNAs,
which are expressed in a locus specific manner. This
underlines their specific regulative impact on locus specific cellular processes. Future research will highlight distinct functions of the identified miRNAs in biomedical
research deciphering cellular reorganization during juvenile intestinal development.
Methods
RNA isolation from porcine intestinal tissue

Intestinal samples (~ 2 cm circle segments) were taken
from duodenum, proximal and distal jejunum, ileum,
ascending and transverse colon of four 31 days old
healthy piglets (EUROC × Pietrain) as described earlier
[26]. The study was performed following internationally
recognized guidelines and was approved by the local animal welfare committee of the Federal Ministry of Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture (No. G0037/02).
The piglets were weaned at the age of 28 days. Samples
were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.
In order to obtain representative measurements in each
intestinal locus, three cross sections of approximately 2
mm out of the 2 cm segment of frozen intestine were
examined. These 3 sections were pooled and total RNA
was isolated from samples using an automated homogenizer (FastPrep Instrument, MP Biomedicals, Heidelberg,
Germany) and the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit
(Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany), according to
the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA quality and quantity of all samples were proven using the Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer and the RNA 6000 Nano Kits (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) and the Nanodrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA).
Solexa sequencing of pig intestinal small RNAs

Small RNAs from the pig total RNA samples were prepared for Solexa sequencing as follows: ~10 μg total RNA
were size-fractionated by Novex 15% TBE-Urea gel
(Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) and RNA fragments of length between 20 and 30 bases were isolated.
The purified small RNAs were then ligated with 5'
adapter (Illumina, CA, USA). To remove unligated adapters, the ligation products (40-60 bases in length) were gel
purified on Novex 15% TBE-Urea gel. Subsequently, the
RNA fragments with the adapter at the 5' end were

Page 12 of 14

ligated with 3' adapters (Illumina). After gel purification
on Novex 10% TBE-Urea gel (Invitrogen), RNA fragments with the adapters at both ends (70-90 bases in
length) were reverse transcribed and the resulting cDNA
was subjected to 15 PCR cycles. The amplification products were loaded on Novex 6% TBE gel (Invitrogen) and
the gel band containing 90- to 100-bp fragments was
excised. The purified DNA fragments were used directly
for cluster generation and 36 cycles of sequencing analysis using the Illumina Cluster Station and 1G Genome
Analyzer following manufacturer's protocols. Sequencing
reads were extracted from the image files generated by
Illumina 1G Genome Analyzer using the open source
Firecrest and Bustard applications (Illumina).
Computational analysis of deep sequenced small RNAs

The deep sequencing reads were clipped of 3' adapters
and mapped to the pig genome as previously described
[35], except that no edits were allowed in the mapping. In
total, 1,422,397 reads mapped perfectly to the genome.
The Sino-Danish pig genome assembly was used for the
analysis [36]. Only genome traces that were minimum
200 nucleotides long and with less than 20% uncalled
nucleotides were considered. Because it is known that
miRNA mature and star sequences do not occur often in
metazoan genomes, deep sequencing reads that mapped
perfectly to the genome five times or more were disregarded for purposes of miRNA prediction. The remaining
reads were used as guidelines for excising potential precursor sequences from the genome, and these were filtered and scored by the miRDeep core algorithm as
previously described [18], except that only mammalian
mature miRNAs from miRBase version 13 were used for
purposes of seed conservation. miRDeep miRNA candidates that had a score of -3.5 and higher were used in the
downstream analysis. Further, since the current pig
genome assembly has imperfect coverage, we employed a
conservation-based approach to produce a set of lowconfidence novel pig miRNAs. First, we identified all
sequences that were perfectly represented by ten or more
reads in the data. Then we identified mature miRNAs
from miRBase Release 14 that matched one or more of
these sequences, allowing for up to two edits. These miRBase miRNAs were flagged as possible orthologs and
each was assigned a pig miRNA sequence identical to the
most abundant matching read sequence. No primate specific miRNA orthologs were flagged, suggesting the
absence of contaminations.
Microfluidic miRNA microarrays

Microfluidic microarray experiments were performed
using customized Geniom biochips (febit). Customized
microarrays were synthesized with the Geniom One

Sharbati et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:275
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/275

device (febit) applying febit's standard shortmer kit for
oligonucleotide synthesis.
The light-activated in situ oligonucleotide synthesis
using a digital micromirror device was performed within
the Geniom One instrument on an activated threedimensional reaction carrier consisting of a glass-siliconglass sandwich (biochip). Using standard DNA synthesis
reagents and 3'-phosphoramidites carrying 5'-photolabile
protective group, oligonucleotides were synthesized in
parallel in eight individually accessible microchannels
(referred to as microarrays) of one biochip. Prior to synthesis, the glass surface was activated by coating with
spacer to facilitate probe-target interaction and to avoid
probe-probe interface [37]. Two different microarray
designs were used. The first one included only the 399
miRDeep predicted mature miRNAs and their star
sequences in seven replicates allowing highly accurate
validation of the miRDeep prediction plus 16 spike-in
controls. The second design consisted of 1117 features in
triplicate, including the identified conserved porcine
mature miRNA sequences (18 mapping to the porcine
genome and another 124, which did not map), 74 known
porcine and 885 human miRNAs from miRBase (13.0)
and 16 spike-in controls.
For microarray experiments, intestinal total RNA samples from different loci of four subjects were isolated
independently and respective pools of total RNA samples
were prepared. All pools underwent a second quality control to determine the quality and quantity using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and the RNA 6000 Nano Kit
according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each
microarray 250 ng of total RNA were suspended in 25 μl
of febit's proprietary miRNA hybridization buffer. The
hybridization was performed automatically for 16 h at
42°C using the Geniom RT-Analyzer (febit). After stringent washing a microfluidic-based extension assay was
performed to label the miRNAs using biotinylated nucleotides [38]. After washing, biotinylated nucleotides were
detected by streptavidin-phycoerythrin and signal recognition and calculation were done automatically within
milliseconds. The background of the chips was effectively
corrected by global background subtraction and interarray effects were corrected by variance stabilizing normalization [39].
Clustering and heatmap analysis of normalized data
was performed using the TM4 software [40] and Venn
diagrams were created applying the program VennMaster
(Version 0.37.3) available at http://www.informatik.uniulm.de/ni/staff/HKestler/vennm/doc.html. Visualization
of the RNA secondary structure was performed using the
RNAfold web server [41]. Pathway analysis of identified
miRNAs was performed by firstly predicting potential
targets using Targetscan Release 5.1 [20]. For target analysis of non conserved porcine miRNAs the tool Tar-

Page 13 of 14

getscan Custom was applied using the seed sequence of
the identified miRNA. Predicted targets were used for
pathway analysis by means of the web based tool DAVID
[21] and considering affected BioCarta and KEGG pathways.
