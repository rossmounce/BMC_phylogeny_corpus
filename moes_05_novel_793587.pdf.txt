Abstract
Background: Four human coronaviruses are currently known to infect the respiratory tract:
human coronaviruses OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and 229E (HCoV-229E), SARS associated coronavirus
(SARS-CoV) and the recently identified human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63). In this study we
explored the incidence of HCoV-NL63 infection in children diagnosed with respiratory tract
infections in Belgium.
Methods: Samples from children hospitalized with respiratory diseases during the winter seasons
of 2003 and 2004 were evaluated for the presence of HCoV-NL63 using a optimized
pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay.
Results: Seven HCoV-NL63 positive samples were identified, six were collected during January/
February 2003 and one at the end of February 2004.
Conclusions: Our results support the notation that HCoV-NL63 can cause serious respiratory
symptoms in children. Sequence analysis of the S gene showed that our isolates could be classified
into two subtypes corresponding to the two prototype HCoV-NL63 sequences isolated in The
Netherlands in 1988 and 2003, indicating that these two subtypes may currently be cocirculating.

Background
Coronaviruses are large, enveloped, positive stranded
RNA-viruses [1]. The viral RNA genome is 27–32 kb in
size, capped, polyadenylated and encapsidated in a helical
nucleocapsid. The envelope is studded with long, petal-

shaped spikes, giving the virus particle a characteristic
crown-like appearance. Three distinct groups of coronaviruses have been described based on serological affinity
and genome sequence. Coronaviruses can infect humans
and a variety of domestic animals and can cause highly

prevalent diseases such as respiratory, enteric, cardiovascular and neurologic disorders [2,3].
Until recently only three human coronaviruses were thoroughly studied. Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43;
group 2) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E;
group 1) were identified in the 1960s. They are responsible for 10–30% of all common colds, and infections occur
mainly during winter and early spring [4-7]. A third novel
human coronavirus, SARS-CoV, was identified as the
causal agent during the 2002–2003 outbreak of severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [8-10]. Phylogenetic
analysis showed that the SARS-CoV does not closely
resemble any of the three previously known groups of
coronaviruses, and therefore a tentative fourth group of
coronaviruses was suggested [11,12]. However, an early
split-off of the SARS-CoV from the coronavirus group 2
lineage has also been suggested [13,14].
A new human coronavirus associated with respiratory illness, HCoV-NL63, was recently identified by a research
team in The Netherlands [15]. The virus was isolated in
January 2003 from a nasopharyngeal aspirate of a 7month-old child suffering from bronchiolitis, conjunctivitis and fever. Screening of specimens from patients with
respiratory symptoms identified seven additional HCoVNL63 infected individuals, both children and adults,
between December 2002 and February 2003. The complete viral genome sequence was determined. The characteristic genome organisation of coronaviruses can be
observed: the 5' two-third of the genome contains two
large open reading frames (ORF), ORF1a and ORF1b. In
the 3' part of the genome, genes encoding four structural
proteins are found: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane
(M), and nucleocapsid (N). The hemagglutinin-esterase
(HE) gene, characteristic for group 2 coronaviruses, is not
present in HCoV-NL63. Sequence analysis demonstrated
that HCoV-NL63 shares 65% sequence identity with
HCoV-229E. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that HCoVNL63 is a new group 1 coronavirus, most closely related
to HCoV-229E and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus
(PEDV) [15]. Shortly after van der Hoek and colleagues
published their discovery of the new human coronavirus
HCoV-NL63, a second research group described the characterization of essentially the same virus [16]. The virus
was isolated from a nose swab sample collected from an
8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in The
Netherlands in April 1988. Real-time RT-PCR assays were
designed for screening of respiratory tract samples. Four
additional HCoV-NL63 positive samples, from children
aged 3 months to 10 years, were detected between
November 2000 and January 2001.
HCoV-NL63 can be considered as a new important cause
of respiratory illnesses and two different subtypes might

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/5/6

be currently cocirculating in the human population [15].
In this study we wanted to explore the incidence of HCoVNL63 infection in children diagnosed with respiratory
tract infections in Belgium.

Methods
Isolates and patients
We studied 309 isolates from 279 patients with severe respiratory symptoms collected from January 2003 until
March 2004 at the University Hospital in Leuven, Belgium. These isolates originated from bronchoalveolar lavages, pharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, and
sputum samples. Routine diagnostic testing was performed for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza
virus, parainfluenza virus and adenovirus. No prior
amplification by cell culture was performed. The results of
diagnostic tests for RSV were negative for 244 isolates,
while 65 isolates were positive for RSV. Patients ranged in
age from 1 month to 16 years, with a mean age of 2 years.
The temporal distribution of the isolates corresponded to
the yearly RSV epidemic period: 236 samples were collected from January to June 2003 and 73 samples were
recovered during the first trimester of 2004 (Figure 1A).
Pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay
RNA was extracted from the collected specimens by using
the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN, Westburg, The
Netherlands) according to instructions of the manufacturer. Screening of the samples was performed by amplifying a 251 bp fragment of the polymerase gene using the
following primer set: Cor-FW (5'-ACWCARHTVAAYYTNAARTAYGC-3')
and
Cor-RV
(5'-TCRCAYTTDGGRTARTCCCA-3') (Figure 2). These one-step RT-PCR
assays (OneStep RT-PCR kit; QIAGEN) were undertaken
in a 50 µl reaction volume containing 10 µL RNA-extract,
10 µl 5x QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Buffer, 2 µl dNTP mix
(final concentration of 400 µM of each dNTP), 1.8 µl QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Enzyme Mix (a combination of
Omniscript and Sensiscript reverse transcriptase and HotStarTaq DNA polymerase), 4 µM of each primer, and
RNase-free water to 50 µl. The reaction was carried out
with an initial reverse transcription step at 50°C for 30
min, followed by PCR activation at 95°C for 15 min, 50
cycles of amplification (30 sec at 94°C; 30 sec at 48°C; 1
min at 72°C), and a final extension step at 72°C for 10
min in a GeneAmp PCR system 9600 thermal cycler
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). PCR-products
were run on a polyacrylamide gel, stained with ethidium
bromide, and visualized under UV-light.
RT-PCR assays for HCoV-NL63
Samples that were found positive for HCoV-NL63 were
confirmed using one-step RT-PCR assays, which amplified
four different regions of the HCoV-NL63 genome. Amplification of a 314-bp gene fragment in the nucleocapsid

assays were performed essentially as described above.
They were carried out using 5 µL RNA-extract and 0.6 µM
of each primer. Only 45 cycles of amplification were run
and annealing temperature was set at 50°C. Furthermore
a 663 bp fragment of the spike gene was amplified using
a RT-nested PCR. The outer primer set SINL5 (5'-GAGTTTGATTAAGAGTGGTAGGTTG-3', nt 20391-nt 20415) and
SINL3 (5'-AACAGTGTAGTTAACTACACGG-3', nt 21068nt 21089) were used in a one-step RT-PCR, performed as
described above, using 10 µl of RNA-extract and an
annealing temperature of 48°C. A nested PCR was carried
out with the inner primer set SINL5n (5'-GGTTGTTGTTACGCAATAATGGTCGT-3', nt 20411-nt 20436) and
SINL3n (5'-ACACGGCCATTATGTGTGGTGAC-3', nt
21051-nt 21073). The nested reaction mix was composed
of 1 unit Taq polymerase, 1 µl of a 25 mM dNTP-mix, 10
µl 5X buffer C (PCR Optimizer Kit, Invitrogen, The Neth-

erlands), and 30 pmol of forward and reverse primer in a
50 µl reaction volume. As template 10 µl of the outer PCR
product was added. The cycling conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, followed
by 40 cycles of amplification (45 sec at 94°C, 45 sec at
54°C, 1 min at 72°C), and a final extension of 5 min at
72°C. PCR-products were run on a polyacrylamide gel,
stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UVlight. The amplicons were purified using the QIAquick
PCR purification kit (QIAGEN) and sequenced with the
respective primer pairs using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Reaction kit (version 3.1) on
an ABI PRISM 3100 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Positive and
negative controls were included in each PCR experiment.
The HCoV-NL63 positive control was RNA isolated from
a HCoV-NL63 culture.

Sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis of the
amplicons
Chromatogram sequencing files were inspected with
Chromas 2.2 (Technelysium Pty Ltd, Helensvale, Australia), and contigs were prepared using SeqMan II
(DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA). The obtained consensus
sequences were compared with the prototype HCoVNL63 sequences available in GenBank database release
142.0 using BLAST analysis (NCBI BLAST server). Multiple sequence alignments were prepared using CLUSTAL X
version 1.82 [26], and manually edited in the GeneDoc
Alignment editor [27]. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using MEGA version 2.1 [28].
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers
The sequences determined in this study have been deposited in the GenBank sequence database under accession
numbers AY758276 to AY758301.
RT-PCR assays for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E
Our collection of samples was also screened using the
pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay for the presence of HCoVOC43 and HCoV-229E. Positive results were confirmed
by one-step RT-PCR using HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E
specific primer pairs located in the membrane glycoprotein region (OC43-FW: 5'-GGCTTATGTGGCCCCTTACT3', nt 28580-nt 28599; OC43-RV: 5'-GGCAAATCTGCCCAAGAATA-3', nt 28894-nt 28913; 229E-FW: 5'TGGCCCCATTAAAAATGTGT-3', nt 24902-nt 24921;
229E-RV: 5'-CCTGAACACCTGAAGCAAT-3', nt 25456-nt
25475) [18]. One-step RT-PCR and sequence analysis
were performed essentially as described above. Annealing
conditions during the RT-PCR assay were modified: the
annealing temperature was set at 55°C.

Results
Pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay
A pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay is a usefull tool to test for
all coronaviruses in a clinical sample. Besides quick
screening for several pathogens in one assay, it supplies
the possibility to identify previously unknown coronaviruses. The consensus RT-PCR assay as described by
Stephensen et al., designed to amplify all known coronaviruses, is not able to detect HCoV-NL63 because of several mismatches with the primer sequences [15,17]. We
modified these consensus primers based on an alignment
of the HCoV-NL63 prototype sequence and 13 other
coronavirus sequences (Figure 2). To determine whether
the newly designed pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay efficiently amplifies a broad range of coronaviruses the RTPCR assay was tested on cell culture supernatant of the
four known human coronaviruses and three animal coronaviruses: HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, SARSCoV, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), porcine
hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/5/6

murine hepatitis virus (MHV). Amplification of the
expected 251 bp region was observed for all tested coronaviruses (Figure 3). The sensitivity of the pancoronavirus
RT-PCR assay was assessed by testing tenfold dilutions of
HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 RNA. While 50 copies of
HCoV-OC43 RNA copies per µl nasopharyngeal aspirate
could be detected, the sensitivity for HCoV-NL63 was a bit
lower i.e. 5 × 103 RNA copies per µl nasopharyngeal
aspirate.
Detection of HCoV-NL63 in clinical specimens
The pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay was used for screening
of specimens from hospitalized patients with respiratory
symptoms collected between January 2003 and March
2004. Samples, from which a 251 bp fragment could be
amplified, were further identified by sequencing using the
pancoronavirus primers. We studied 309 specimens with
a temporal distribution that corresponded with the yearly
RSV epidemic period (Figure 1A). A total of 244 samples
were found negative for RSV by diagnostic testing. The
279 patients in this study comprised of 211 patients aged
<2 years (75.6%), 68 aged 2–16 years (24.4%). We
detected HCoV-NL63 in 7 samples (2.3%). One positive
sample was collected at the end of January 2003 and coinfection with RSV type B was present. Five of the positive
samples were collected within a ten-day period at the end
of February 2003, and one positive sample was collected
at the end of February 2004, which showed coinfection
with adenovirus and parainfluenza virus (Figure 1B, Table
1). The seven positive samples were obtained from one
patient aged 1 month, four patients of 1 year, one patient
of 2 years, and one patient of 16 years. The patient files
showed that all subjects suffered from respiratory tract illness and some had underlying disease (Table 1).

The seven HCoV-NL63 positive respiratory samples were
confirmed by alternative RT-PCR assays. Amplification of
a fragment of the nucleocapside gene and ORF1b was carried out. Sequence analysis of the N gene fragments and
the ORF1b fragments showed 98–100% similarity to the
prototype HCoV-NL63 sequences available in the GenBank database (AY567487, AY518894). A third one-step
RT-PCR was carried out for each positive sample to
amplify part of the ORF1a gene. Sequence analysis of the
ORF1a PCR-products revealed 99% sequence identity
with both HCoV-NL63 prototype sequences available in
GenBank. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was
constructed based on an alignment of the ORF1a nucleotide sequences from the HCoV-NL63 positive samples
and the available HCoV-NL63 sequences in GenBank.
HCoV-229E was used as an outgroup. The dendrogram
shows that all HCoV-NL63 sequences cluster together, but
two subclusters can be observed (Figure 4).

Inspection of the two full genome HCoV-NL63 sequences
available in GenBank demonstrates that especially the
aminoterminal region of the Spike protein can be very
divergent. Therefore we decided to amplify this region to
investigate the variability of these region in our patients.
An RT-nested PCR assay was used to amplify part of the S
gene. These partial spike sequences showed 98% similarity with the HCoV-NL63 prototype strains. An alignment
of the S gene sequences from the Belgian samples, partial
spike sequences from the positive samples identified in
The Netherlands (data not shown), and the prototype
HCoV-NL63 sequences, was used to constitute a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree. The neighbor-joining tree

was evaluated by 500 bootstrap pseudoreplicates. Two
clusters can again be observed (Figure 5).
Detection of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E
Screening of our sample collection for the presence of
HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E was also performed. We
detected HCoV-OC43 in 7 of 309 samples (2.3%) and
HCoV-229E in one sample (0.3%). The seven HCoVOC43 positive samples were collected during the winter
and early spring of 2003 and 2004. The sample in which
we detected HCoV-229E was collected in April 2003. The
positive samples were confirmed by RT-PCR using specific
HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E primer pairs that amplify
part of the M gene [18]. The HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E

and HCoV-229E prototype sequences in GenBank.

Discussion
RSV, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, and parainfluenzaviruses are probably the most important viral agents of
severe respiratory diseases. However, a substantial part of
respiratory tract infections can not be attributed to any
known pathogen. Underlying conditions and immunosuppression largely determine the impact of respiratory
viruses on individuals [19]. The common cold viruses
HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E have also been associated
with more severe lower respiratory tract conditions in
infants and immunocompromised patients [20-23]. The
clinical symptoms associated with HCoV-NL63 infections
still need to be determined, but there are some indications
that HCoV-NL63 can cause severe respiratory illnesses in
children and immunocompromised adults [15,16]. We
detected HCoV-NL63, using a pancoronavirus RT-PCR, in
patients suffering from relatively severe respiratory dis-

eases necessitating hospitalization. These positive samples were collected from children aged 1 month to 16
years. Two patients suffered from severe underlying
disease: one patient suffered from Smith-Lemli-Opitz
syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder due to a
primary enzymatic defect in the cholesterol metabolism.
A second patient was diagnosed with VATER, a syndrome
characterized by the sporadic association of specific birth
defects or abnormalities such as vertebrae and vascular
anomalies, anal atresia, trachea and esophagus problems
and renal anomalities. All HCoV-NL63 infected patients
established a complete recovery from their respiratory
symptoms. One-step RT-PCR assays were used to detect
and confirm these positive samples.
Results from epidemiological surveys conducted in the
1970's have led to the conclusion that human coronaviruses are distributed worldwide and circulate during seasonal outbreaks [22]. Our results indicate that HCoVNL63 is the causal agent in a significant portion of respiratory diseases of unknown etiology. We detected HCoVNL63 in respiratory samples collected in February 2003,
with a frequency of 7.1%, and during February 2004, with
a frequency of 2.5%. These results seem to support the
tendency of human coronaviruses to circulate mainly during the winter season [7,24]. However, in this study,
sampling was only performed from January to May during
the yearly RSV epidemic period, while no samples from
the summer and autumn months were screened. The first
publication on HCoV-NL63 showed that the virus circulated in Amsterdam during the winter months of 2002/
2003 [15]. More recently another set of Amsterdam samples was screened, obtained during the winter of 2001/
2002 and 2003/2004. HCoV-NL63 was found in one trachea sample obtained in February 2002, and in two
oropharyngeal aspirates from December 2003 and January 2004, respectively (data not shown). Combined with
the data that we present here from Belgium, these findings
confirm that HCoV-NL63 reappears each winter season
similar to the previously known respiratory viruses.
Recently, research teams from Australia, Japan and Canada, have submitted partial HCoV-NL63 sequences to the
GenBank database (AY600442-AY600446, AY662694AY662698, AY675541-AY675553). This indicates that
this newly discovered human coronavirus has a worldwide distribution.
Sequence analysis of the highly conserved nucleocapsid
region showed that the Belgian isolates are similar to the
two prototype HCoV-NL63 complete genome sequences
in GenBank isolated in the Netherlands in 1988 and
2003. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of part of the
ORF 1a region of our patients showed the same subclusters of HCoV-NL63 that were described previously [15]
(Figure 4). This finding supports the suggestion that

several HCoV-NL63 subtypes with distinct molecular
markers are cocirculating, also in Belgium. A large insert
in the 5' part of the S gene of HCoV-NL63 compared with
HCoV-229E has been described [15,16]. Both HCoVNL63 complete genome sequences show only 89%
sequence identity in this spike insert region, which
implies that there are at least two different HCoV-NL63
subtypes. Sequence analysis of this spike insert region
revealed that our samples show similarity to both prototype HCoV-NL63 subtypes, which was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. The partial S gene sequences cluster
together with the two prototype HCoV-NL63 sequences in
two different groups (Figure 5). This confirms that the
HCoV-NL63 subtypes first isolated in 1988 and 2003 are
cocirculating. When analysing the dendrograms based on
ORF1a and S gene sequences, a discordance in the clustering pattern of some HCoV-NL63 isolates (e.g. HCoV-NL
and NL-p223) can be observed, suggesting a possible
recombination event. Further research of complete
genome sequences of these isolates is required. Drawing
conclusions based on phylogenetic analysis of one single
gene therefore requires caution as the true phylogeny can
only be demonstrated by analysing complete genome
sequences.
Screening of our sample collection for the presence of
HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E revealed seven HCoVOC43 positive samples and only one HCoV-229E positive
sample. All positive samples were isolated during winter
and early spring, which is concordant with the results of
previous epidemiological studies. HCoV-OC43 infected
samples were mainly identified during February 2003 and
February 2004 (Figure 1B). These data show that the epidemic seasons of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 coincide.
The positive samples were collected from children aged 1
to 12 years, whom all suffered from respiratory symptoms. The very low detection rate of HCoV-229E compared with the frequent detection of HCoV-NL63, might
imply that HCoV-NL63, closely related to HCoV-229E, is
currently more important as a causal agent of respiratory
diseases. At the moment, there are no data concerning
cross-neutralization between HCoV-229E and HCoVNL63. In theory, such cross-neutralization might be possible, since both viruses are relatively closely related species belonging to coronavirus group 1. Antigenic crossreactivity has already been demonstrated between SARSCoV and group 1 coronaviruses TGEV, FIPV and CCoV
[25].

Conclusions
Human coronavirus NL63 is a new important respiratory
pathogen that can cause severe respiratory infections in
children. Sequence analysis of the HCoV-NL63 isolates
detected in our study demonstrates that our Belgian isolates can be classified into two subtypes corresponding to
the two prototype HCoV-NL63 sequences isolated in The
Netherlands in 1988 and 2003. Our findings indicate that
these two subtypes may currently be cocirculating.

The development of a pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay using
a primer set that matches all known coronaviruses might
be useful for the identification of new coronaviruses. This
pancoronavirus RT-PCR-assay can also be used as a diagnostic tool to detect any of the four currently known
human coronaviruses in clinical samples.
