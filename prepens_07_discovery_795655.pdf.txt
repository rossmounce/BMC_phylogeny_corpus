Abstract
Targeting the highly conserved herpes DNA polymerase (DPOL) gene with PCR using panherpes
degenerate primers is a powerful tool to universally detect unknown herpesviruses. However,
vertebrate hosts are often infected with more than one herpesvirus in the same tissue, and panherpes DPOL PCR often favors the amplification of one viral sequence at the expense of the others.
Here we present two different technical approaches that overcome this obstacle: (i) Pan-herpes
DPOL PCR is carried out in the presence of an oligonucleotide substituted with locked nucleic
acids (LNA).This suppresses the amplification of a specific herpesvirus DPOL sequence by a factor
of approximately 1000, thereby enabling the amplification of a second, different DPOL sequence.
(ii) The less conserved glycoprotein B (gB) gene is targeted with several sets of degenerate primers
that are restricted to gB genes of different herpesvirus subfamilies or genera. These techniques
enable the amplification of gB and DPOL sequences of multiple viruses from a single specimen. The
partial gB and DPOL sequences can be connected by long-distance PCR, producing final contiguous
sequences of approximately 3.5 kbp. Such sequences include parts of two genes and therefore
allow for a robust phylogenetic analysis. To illustrate this principle, six novel herpesviruses of the
genera Rhadinovirus, Lymphocryptovirus and Cytomegalovirus were discovered in multi-infected
samples of non-human primates and phylogenetically characterized.

Background
PCR-based methods have been used for over a decade to
discover unknown herpesviruses. VanDevanter and coworkers [1] were the first to design degenerate primers
against the highly conserved DPOL gene in order to detect
unknown herpesviruses by PCR. Since then, several variations of the original method were published, for example
PCR based on deoxyinosine substituted primers [2] or

consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primers [3].
Despite of the tremendous efficiency of these methods in
detecting previously unknown viruses [4-8], they all have
a limitation: In specimens from a multi-infected individual, they usually amplify a viral sequence from only one
of the herpesviruses present. For example, pigs are
infected with three different lymphotropic herpesviruses
(PLHV-1, PLHV-2 and PLHV-3) with high prevalence, and

a considerable percentage is double- or triple- infected
[9,10]. We easily detected PLHV-1 and PLHV-2 with panherpes DPOL PCR [11] but we needed another 2 years and
a large collection of porcine blood and tissue samples to
find PLHV-3 with the same method in a small number of
PLHV-1- and PLHV-2-negative samples [9]. Retrospective
analysis of the sample collection with PLHV-3-specific
primers revealed that PLHV-3 was not less prevalent than
PLHV-1. However, less efficient amplification of PLHV-3
by pan-herpes DPOL PCR prevented its detection in double- or triple-infected samples [unpublished data].

sively inhibit the amplification of known herpesvirus
sequences, thereby facilitating the amplification of additional unknown herpesvirus sequences from multiinfected specimens.
The glycoprotein B (gB) gene is located immediately
upstream of the DPOL gene in beta- and gammaherpesviruses, and is less conserved than the DPOL gene. It only
allows for the design of more restricted degenerate primers i.e. gB sequences of a single herpesvirus subfamily or
genus can be amplified, while sequences of viruses
belonging to other genera remain excluded.

Another shortcoming limitation of this technique is, that
the amplified sequences are short (usually <0.5 kb).
Although this is beneficial for the sensitivity of the PCR,
short sequences are often not sufficient for the construction of phylogenetic trees revealing acceptable probabilities for all clades.

By combining these two experimental procedures, six
novel primate herpesviruses of the genera Rhadinovirus,
Lymphocryptovirus and Cytomegalovirus were discovered in
multi-infected specimens. To determine which gB and
which DPOL sequences originated from the same virus
genome, the putative gB/DPOL pairs were connected by
long-distance (LD) PCR. Final contiguous sequences of
approximately 3.5 kbp were compiled and used for robust
phylogenetic analysis.

Here we present a combination of two experimental
approaches to overcome these shortcomings: (i) Pan-herpes DPOL PCR was carried out in the presence of an additional oligonucleotide modified by the introduction of
locked nucleic acids (LNA). (ii) The less conserved glycoprotein B (gB) gene was amplified with degenerate primers of limited detection capacity i.e. genus-specific
primers.

Methods
Sample collection and DNA preparation
Blood and tissue samples from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus), deceased from various reasons, were collected
in the Taï National Park of Côte d'Ivoire. Samples of other
Old World primates, deceased in captivity, were collected
in the German Primate Centre (DPZ) and in the Zoological Gardens of Berlin, Germany (Table 1). DNA was prepared as described previously [16].

LNAs are ribonucleotides containing a methylene bridge
that connects the 2'-oxygen of the ribose with the 4'-carbon. The result is a locked 3'- endo conformation that
reduces the conformational flexibility of the ribose and
forces the conformational transition from the B-type to
the A-type [12]. The introduction of LNAs into DNA and
RNA improves the hybridization affinity and increases the
melting temperature by 1°-8°C/LNA nucleotide [13].
LNAs have been widely used for the control of gene
expression, in particular for therapeutic purposes
[Reviewed by: [14]]. A recent report described the use of
LNAs in cDNA-based real-time PCR in order to inhibit the
amplification of contaminating genomic DNA [15]. In the
present study, LNAs were used for the first time to exclu-

Pan-herpes PCR in the presence of LNA
LNA-substituted oligonucleotides (LNA) (TIB MOLBIOL
GmbH, Berlin, Germany) were used to specifically inhibit
the amplification of primate lymphocryptovirus (LCV)
DPOL sequences, namely those of Pan troglodytes lymphocryptovirus 1 (PtroLCV-1), Gorilla gorilla lymphocryptovirus 1 (GgorLCV-1), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),
Macaca fascicularis lymphocryptovirus 1 (MfasLCV-1),
Colobus guereza lymphocryptovirus 1 (CgueLCV-1),
Papio hamadryas lymphocryptovirus 2 (PhamLCV-2) [7]
and Callitrichine herpesvirus 3 (CalHV-3) [17]. An additional LNA was used to inhibit DPOL amplification of Pan
troglodytes rhadinovirus 1 (PtroRHV-1; this study). To
prevent the LNAs to function as PCR primers, an NH2-res-

of LNA-CalHV3 and LNA-PtroRHV1, the LNAs overlap the
binding region of the inner anti-sense primer (IYG) by
2–3 bp (Figures 1 and 2).
LNA-MfasLCV1 specifically targets the 5'-end of both the

Consensus-PCR with specificity for the glycoprotein B
gene and for the major DNA binding protein gene of
cytomegaloviruses
For the amplification of the gB gene, deg/dI primers were
used in a nested format (Table 3). The primers were
deduced from the gB genes of Equine herpesvirus 2
(primer set RH-gB), Epstein-Barr Virus (set LC-gB) and
Human Cytomegalovirus (set CM-gB) and used for amplification of members of the genera Rhadinovirus, Lymphocryptovirus and Cytomegalovirus, respectively. They were
degenerated and substituted with deoxyinosine at their 3'end. Their binding region is depicted in Figure 1. PCR was

carried out as described for the DPOL gene, with an
annealing temperature of 45°C.
For the major DNA binding protein (MDBP) gene amplification of members of the genus Cytomegalovirus, nested
consensus PCR was carried out with deg/dI primers,
which were deduced from the MDBP gene of Cercopithecine herpesvirus 8 (CeHV-8) (Table 3). The PCR was carried out as described for the DPOL gene, with an
annealing temperature of 46°C.
PCR under less stringent conditions
Samples without amplification product in the panherpes
DPOL PCR and in all gB PCRs were reanalysed under
more relaxed conditions i.e. the ramp time between the
annealing step and the extension step was prolonged 50fold. In addition, the polymerase was only partially activated before cycling (2 min at 90°C), and the number of
cycles was increased from 45 to 50.
Long-distance PCR
LD-PCR was performed with the TaKaRa-Ex PCR system
(Takara Bio Inc., Japan) or the Long-template PCR system
(Roche, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's
instructions, and amplimers were obtained by nested
PCR. For the second round, a one μl aliquot of the first
round was used as template.

Specific amplification of DPOL sequences from
lymphocryptoviruses
From EBV, PtroLCV-1, GgorLCV-1 and CalHV-3, segments
of the respective DPOL genes (approximately 1 kbp) were
amplified (primers not listed). The amplimers span the
entire binding region of the deg/dI pan-herpes DPOL
primers, and were used in dilution series to test the LNA
efficiency in the pan-herpes DPOL PCR.
Real-time PCR
For the quantitative evaluation of LNA efficiency, the second round of pan-herpes DPOL PCR was performed as
real-time PCR. The PCR mix was made up to a volume of
25 μl containing 1.5 μl of the first round reaction product,
1 × PCR buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM (each) of dATP,
dCTP, dGTP and dTTP (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany, respectively), 2 U of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 1 μM
(each) of the forward and reverse primers, 1.0 μM SYBR
Green I and 1.0 μM ROX as a passive reference. LNAs were
added to the PCR reaction mix in a concentration of 1 μM.
The reactions were carried out in 8-tube-strips (ABgene,
Epsom-Surrey, UK) using an ABI Prism 7500 Sequence
Detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
Sequence analysis and phylogenetic tree construction
PCR product purification, direct sequencing with dye terminator chemistry as well as nucleotide and amino acid
sequence analysis were performed as described [18].
Sequence files were assembled with the Seqman module
of the Lasergene software (GATC, Konstanz, Germany).

BLAST searches were performed using the NCBI database.
ORF prediction and calculation of identity values were
performed with the program MacVector (Version 8.0).
Multiple sequence alignments were performed with the
clustalW module of MacVector. For phylogenetic tree construction, a multiple alignment of concatenated 1100
amino acids (aa) was analysed with the neighbor-joining
method (MacVector). In addition, the alignment was analysed with the program Tree-Puzzle (Version 5.0).
Tentative nomenclature of novel herpesviruses
For the purpose of this study, the novel viruses were
named trinomially: The first 2 words designate the name
of the host species, while the third word designates the
tentative assignment of the novel virus to a herpesvirus
genus within the Herpesviridae. The numbering was done
according to the chronological order of discovery. Example: Macaca fascicularis rhadinovirus 1.

Abbreviations use the first letter of the generic host name
and the first three letters of the specific host name, followed by the abbreviation of the viral genus. Example:
Macaca fascicularis rhadinovirus (RHV) 1, MfasRHV-1.

The amplification of PtroLCV-1 DPOL was severely
impaired by LNA-PtroLCV1. In the presence of this LNA,
a minimum of 1000 copies was needed to obtain an
amplimer visible after gel-electrophoretic analysis (not
shown). In the absence of LNA-PtroLCV1, 1–10 copies of
PtroLCV-1 were still amplifiable. Similar results were
achieved by repeating the second PCR round in the presence of SYBR green I in a real-time set-up. In the presence
of LNA-PtroLCV1, the CT-values rose by 11–12 cycles (Figure 3a). From this data it was concluded that LNAPtroLCV1 inhibited the amplification of PtroLCV-1 DPOL
by a factor of approximately 1000.
A similar inhibition efficiency was seen when the
GgorLCV-1 DPOL template was amplified in the presence
of LNA-GgorLCV1 (factor approximately 1.000). The EBV
DPOL template was even more effectively inhibited in the
presence of LNA-EBV (factor >10.000) (data not shown).
Various LNA concentrations were tested for their inhibition efficiency. Concentrations of 4 μM, 2 μM, 1 μM and
0.5 μM of LNA-PtroLCV1 inhibited the amplification of
PtroLCV-1 DPOL to a similar degree. A concentration of
0.25 mM resulted in a decreased inhibition (not shown).
For the remainder of the experiments presented here a 1
μM of LNA was routinely used.

Results

We next tested, whether LNAs exert their effect in a
sequence-specific manner. For this purpose, EBV DPOL
was amplified in the presence of the LNA-PtroLCV1 that
contains 3 mismatches within the LNA binding region.
Two of the mismatches were LNA-substituted (Figure 2).
In the presence or absence of the LNA, a similar amount
of amplimer was obtained in real-time PCR. Thus, the
amplification of EBV DPOL was not inhibited by the LNAPtroLCV1 (not shown). Conversely, the PtroLCV-1 template was tested with LNA-EBV, which also exhibits 3 mismatches within the LNA binding region. However, no
mismatch was LNA-substituted (Figure 2). Using 103 template molecules, a slight inhibition (factor of <10) was
observed. Higher template concentrations were not
affected by the LNA-EBV as revealed by real-time PCR
(Figure 3b).

LNA-substituted oligonucleotides specifically inhibit the
amplification of DPOL sequences in the pan-herpes DPOL
PCR
Approximately 1 kbp of the PtroLCV-1, the GgorLCV-1,
the EBV and the CalHV-3 DPOL gene were amplified with
specific primers (not listed). These PCR fragments span
the complete DPOL region targeted by pan-herpes consensus PCR (Figure 1). Serial ten-fold dilutions of these
fragments, covering a range of 107 to 10-1 copy numbers,
were used as templates in the pan-herpes DPOL PCR,
either in the presence or absence of perfectly matching
LNAs.

Finally, we tested the impact of LNAs, which exhibit only
one or two mismatches to a certain DPOL sequence in
their binding region. LNAGgorLCV1 exhibits two mismatches to the PtroLCV-1 DPOL, and both were LNA-substituted (Figure 2). With LNA-GgorLCV1, the inhibitory
effect on amplification of the PtroLCV-1 DPOL sequence
was 10-fold lower than on the exactly matching GgorLCV1 DPOL sequence. In the case of the LNA-PtroLCV1, the
one mismatch to the GgorLCV-1 sequence was not LNAsubstituted (Figure 2), and LNA-PtroLCV1 inhibited the
amplification of GgorLCV-1 DPOL to the same extent as

between these templates (data not shown).
Selective amplification of herpesvirus DPOL templates
from template mixtures using pan-herpes PCR and LNAsubstituted oligonucleotides
Three mixtures of the 1 kbp templates of the GgorLCV-1,
EBV and CalHV-3 DPOL genes were prepared. In each of
these, one template was present in a copy number repre-

senting its individual detection limit in the pan-herpes
PCR. The other two templates were present in 10-fold
excess over their individual detection limit. Pan-herpes
PCR was set up in the presence of two LNAs targeting the
two over-represented HV. In each LNA-supplemented
PCR assay, the amplification of the two over-represented
HV was inhibited and the single under-represented HV
was amplified as revealed by sequencing (Table 4, assays
A to C). The experiment was repeated, but with the two
over-represented HV present in 100-fold excess. In the

assays D and E, listed in Table 4, the under-represented
GgorLCV-1 DPOL and EBV DPOL were selectively amplified, respectively. However, when CalHV-3 was underrepresented, the 100-fold over-represented GgorLCV-1
DPOL was detected instead (Table 4, assay F).
To further investigate the versatility of the LNA-supplemented panherpes PCR, four identical mixtures of four
LCV templates were prepared. This time, template concentrations were chosen at which amplification was only partially inhibited by the LNA. Three LNAs were added to
each of the four PCR reactions in four different combinations. From each mixture the expected sequence was
amplified i.e. that sequence against which no corresponding LNA had been added (data not shown). It was concluded that at least four unknown herpesviruses might be
selectively amplified from multi-infected samples using a
panel of LNAs.
Discovery of rhadinoviruses in lymphocryptovirus-positive
samples of chimpanzees
The LNAs, which were successfully used in dissecting artificial LCV template mixtures, were now used for the analysis of herpesvirus-positive blood and tissue samples of

primates. Samples of two chimpanzees ("Noah" and
"Leo"; Pan troglodytes verus), which lived in the Taï
National Park of Côte d'Ivoire and died from anthrax disease [19], were analysed with pan-herpes DPOL PCR
resulting in the detection of PtroLCV-1 [7]. To unravel the
simultaneous presence of other herpesviruses, the panherpes DPOL PCR was carried out in the presence of LNAPtroLCV1, using spleen samples of Noah and Leo. As a
control, the PCR was carried out without LNA. While in
the control reaction PtroLCV-1 DPOL was amplified, the
presence of the LNA resulted in the amplification of a
novel RHV DPOL sequence. The virus, from which this
sequence originated, was tentatively named PtroRHV-1.
To amplify a gB sequence of PtroRHV-1, the gB primer set
RH-gB was then applied to several samples from Noah,
Leo and chimpanzees of the same group. In a sample of
the chimpanzee "Gargantuan", a RHV gB sequence was
detected. It could be connected to the PtroRHV-1 DPOL
sequence by LD-PCR, and therefore originated from
PtroRHV-1. A 3.4 kbp sequence was finally compiled
spanning the 3'-end of the gB gene (approximately 1 kb)
and the 5'-end of the DPOL gene (approximately 2.2 kb)
of PtroRHV-1 (Figure 1).

In the spleen samples of Noah and Leo, a different RHV
gB sequence was detected, as indicated by an identity percentage of only 70% to the PtroRHV-1 gB sequence. The
virus, from which this gB sequence originated, was tentatively named PtroRHV-2.
To amplify the DPOL sequence of PtroRHV-2, two aliquots of Leo's spleen, originating from different regions
within the organ, were subjected to pan-herpes DPOL
PCR. This time two LNAs were used (LNA-PtroLCV1 and
LNA-PtroRHV1; Table 2 and Figure 1) to simultaneously
inhibit the amplification of PtroLCV-1 and PtroRHV-1
DPOL and thus to be able to detect PtroRHV-2 DPOL. In
aliquot 1 of Leo's spleen, PtroLCV-1 was detected in the
absence of the LNAs. By including LNA-PtroLCV1,
PtroRHV-1 was detected. Using both LNAs, nothing was
detected. Therefore, the sample did apparently not contain PtroRHV-2 in a copy number sufficient for pan-herpes PCR (Figure 4). However, the dual-inhibition
approach proved successful with the second spleen aliquot. Using both LNAs, a second RHV DPOL sequence was
discovered (Figure 4). It revealed a percentage of identity
to PtroRHV-1 DPOL of 52%. This DPOL sequence could
be connected to the PtroRHV-2 gB sequence by LD-PCR,
and therefore originated from PtroRHV-2. A 3.4 kbp
sequence of PtroRHV-2 was finally compiled (Figure 1).
In a pair-wise nucleic acid sequence comparison, the 3.4
kbp sequence of PtroRHV-1 was found to be 99% identical in its 3'-terminus to a 1 kbp DPOL sequence detected
in a captive Pan troglodytes troglodytes [20]. The 3.4 kbp

sequence of PtroRHV-2 was 98% identical in its 3'-terminus to a 1.1 16 kbp DPOL sequence detected in three wildcaught Pan troglodytes troglodytes, one from Gabon and two
from Cameroon [21]. No close matches were found in
Genbank for the 5'-parts (2.4 kbp) of the PtroRHV-1 and
PtroRHV-2 sequences, spanning a part of the DPOL and
the gB gene. Since both originated from Pan troglodytes
verus (Côte d'Ivoire), they were regarded as originating
from hitherto unknown P. tr. verus RHV, closely related to
P. tr. troglodytes RHV.
Discovery of rhadinoviruses in LCV-positive samples of
cynomolgus monkeys
Blood and organ samples of 18 cynomolgus monkeys
(Macaca fascicularis) from the colony of the German Primate Centre were analysed with panherpes DPOL PCR. In
21 out of 35 samples, amplimers of Macaca fascicularis
lymphocryptovirus 1 (MfasLCV-1) [7] were obtained
(data not shown). In one blood sample, a rhadinovirus
DPOL sequence was found and the virus tentatively
named Macaca fascicularis rhadinovirus 1 (MfasRHV-1).
Re-inspection of the individuals with the gB primer set
RH-gB revealed two RHV gB sequences (RHV1-gB and
RHV2-gB). They had only 72% nucleotide sequence identity to each other. LD-PCR revealed that the RHV1-gB
sequence originated from the same virus genome as the
MfasRHV-1 DPOL sequence. A final gB to DPOL sequence
(3.4 kbp) of MfasRHV-1 was compiled.

The virus from which the RHV2-gB sequence originated
was tentatively named MfasRHV-2. To amplify a DPOL
sequence of MfasRHV-2, the panherpes DPOL PCR was
carried out in the presence of LNA-MfasLCV1. As a control, the PCR was carried out without LNA. While
MfasLCV-1 DPOL was amplified in the control reaction,
the presence of the LNA resulted in the amplification of a
second RHV DPOL sequence. This could be connected to
the MfasRHV-2 gB sequence with LD-PCR, resulting in a
final MfasRHV-2 gB to DPOL sequence of 3.4 kbp.

[23]. Pairwise comparison of the complete gB to DPOL
sequence of MfasRHV-1 with the corresponding
sequences of (i) MfasRHV-2, (ii) rhesus monkey rhadinovirus and (iii) Human herpesvirus 8 revealed identities of
65%, 67% and 64%, respectively.

Discovery of a third lymphocryptovirus species in an LCVpositive sample of a baboon
Two LCV of baboons (Papio hamadryas) are presently
known, Papio hamadryas lymphocryptovirus 1 (PhamLCV-1 = Herpesvirus papio = Cercopithecine herpesvirus 12)
[24] and Papio hamadryas lymphocryptovirus 2 (PhamLCV-2) [7]. While several genomic regions of PhamLCV-1
had been already determined, including the complete gB
gene [25], only a short partial DPOL sequence of PhamLCV-2 had been described [7]. Therefore, we inspected
five PhamLCV-2-positive P. hamadryas with the LC-gB
primer set. Two different gB sequences were detected.

The first could be connected to the PhamLCV-2 DPOL
sequence by LD-PCR, and a final PhamLCV-2 sequence of
3.2 kbp was obtained. The second gB sequence differed
slightly from the corresponding gB sequences of PhamLCV-1 and PhamLCV-2 (90% and 95% identity, respectively). The virus from which this gB sequence originated
was tentatively named PhamLCV-3.
To amplify a DPOL sequence of PhamLCV-3, the panherpes DPOL PCR was performed with and without LNAPhamLCV2. In the control reaction PhamLCV-2 DPOL
was amplified, while the presence of the LNA resulted in
the amplification of a different LCV DPOL sequence (85%
identity). This putative PhamLCV-3 sequence could be
connected with the PhamLCV-3 gB sequence by LD-PCR,
resulting in a final PhamLCV-3 gB to DPOL sequence of
3.3 kbp.
An alignment of the novel PhamLCV-3 sequence with
LNA-PhamLCV2 revealed three mismatches. In addition,
one of the mismatching bases within the LNA-PhamLCV2
was LNA-substituted. These features most probably prevented the targeting of PhamLCV-3 DPOL by LNAPhamLCV2.
The three LCV of P. hamadryas were compared on the basis
of gB sequences (a longer DPOL sequence was not available for PhamLCV-1). Identity percentages of 89% (LCV-3
versus LCV-1) and 93% (LCV-3 versus LCV-2) were
obtained.
Discovery of cytomegaloviruses in LCV-positive samples of
a black-and-white colobus
Blood, spleen, brain, kidney, bone marrow, stomach and
mucosa of the mouth of a black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza) from the Berlin zoological gardens, which
died of a disease of unclear etiology, were analysed with
pan-herpes DPOL PCR. In 6/7 samples, the lymphocryptovirus CgueLCV-1 [7] was found. In the kidney, a novel
cytomegalovirus was discovered and tentatively named
Colobus guereza cytomegalovirus 1 (CgueCMV-1).

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/84

Inspection of all samples with the gB primer set CM-gB
revealed two distinct gB sequences. One was found in the
kidney and brain and the other in liver and mucosa
(CMV-1 and CMV-2, respectively). They had a nucleotide
sequence identity of 82%. With LD-PCR, the CMV-1 gB
sequence and the CgueCMV-1 DPOL sequence could be
connected (Figure 5A).
The virus, from which the CMV-2 gB sequence was
derived, was tentatively named CgueCMV-2. To amplify
the missing DPOL sequence of CgueCMV-2, the
CgueCMV-2-positive samples were subjected to the panherpes DPOL PCR in the presence of the LNA-MfasLCV1
(Table 3 and Figure 2). In the control reaction without
LNA CgueLCV-1 DPOL was amplified, while the presence
of the LNA-MfasLCV1 surprisingly resulted in the amplification of CgueCMV-1 DPOL with 100% identity. Because
no other CMV sequence was found, we speculated that
CgueCMV-2 might differ from CgueCMV-1 only in the gB
gene but not in the DPOL gene. This was indeed the case,
since we could connect the CgueCMV-2 gB sequence with
the CgueCMV-1 DPOL sequence by LD-PCR (Figures 1
and 5A).
Pairwise comparison of both CgueCMV nucleotide
sequences revealed a difference on the nucleotide level of
11% in the gB gene and only 2% in the DPOL gene. Therefore, they were regarded as variants of the same viral species and renamed CgueCMV-1.1 and CgueCMV-1.2. To
evaluate, (i) how broad the differences are between the
complete gB genes of both CgueCMV- 1.1 and CgueCMV1.2 and (ii) whether the conserved ORFs upstream of the
gB gene reveal extensive amino acid variations, we amplified with degenerate primers and sequenced a part of the
gene (ORF UL57) encoding for the MDBP (Figure 5A).
This sequence was connected with both the gB sequences
of CgueCMV-1.1 and CgueCMV-1.2 by LD-PCR (Figure
5A). For both viruses, a final sequence of about 8 kb was
determined, encoding a part of the ORF UL57 (MDBP),
the complete ORFs UL56 and UL55 (gB), and two thirds
of the ORF UL54 (DPOL) (Figure 6B). The nucleotide and
amino acid sequence differences of CgueCMV-1.1 and
CgueCMV-1.2 were 0.6% and 0.5% (UL56), 20% and 8%
(UL55) and 1% and 0.1% (UL54), respectively.
Phylogenetic analysis of the novel beta- and
gammaherpesviruses
A phylogenetic tree was constructed with concatenated aa
sequences of gB and DPOL. It is the first comprehensive
tree of primate beta- and ammaherpesviruses based on gB
and DPOL sequences of more than 1000 aa. Nearly all
viruses branched with a probability of 70–100%.

Phylogenetic analysis of the novel primate herpesviruses
Phylogenetic analysis of the novel primate herpesviruses. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the amino
acid (aa) sequences encoded by the gB-DPOL segments of
the novel primate herpesviruses and of known human and
non-human primate herpesviruses, available in GenBank. A
multiple alignment of concatenated 1100 aa was analysed
with the neighbor-joining method. A midpoint-rooted phylogram is shown. The branch length is proportional to evolutionary distance (scale bar). Results of bootstrap analysis
(100-fold) are indicated at the nodes of the tree, to the left of
the first vertical divider. In addition, the alignment was analysed with Tree-Puzzle 5.0. Support values, estimated by the
quartet puzzling (QP) tree search and expressing the QP reliability in percent, are indicated at the nodes of the tree to
the left of the vertical divider. Nodes with values below 70%
in both analyses were depicted as pat of a multifurcation
(black bar). Viruses, which are entirely novel or viruses for
which additional sequence information was generated, are
highlighted with black arrows. Herpesvirus genera and families are indicated. Full names of known viruses and their
nucleotide sequence accession numbers are listed in the
Methods section.

RHV-1 and MfasRHV-2) strongly confirmed the concept
of two distinct primate rhadinovirus lineages published
earlier [26]. While PtroRHV-1 and MfasRHV-1 appeared
as members of the RHV1 group (HHV8-like), PtroRHV-2
and MfasRHV-2 belonged to the RHV2 group of which the
M. mulatta rhadinovirus RRV is the best-characterized
member. The baboon lymphocryptoviruses PhamLCV-2
and PhamLCV-3 were closely related to each other and to
PhamLCV-1. They clustered in the group of Old World primate lymphocryptoviruses, of which EBV is the prominent member. The colobus betaherpesviruses CgueCMV1.1 and 1.2 appeared as closely related members of the
genus Cytomegalovirus (Figure 6).

This is the first report describing the differential amplification of virus sequences by the aid of LNA-substituted oligonucleotides. The LNA inhibited the amplification of
specific, perfectly matching HV DPOL sequences and enabled the discovery of other, unknown HV DPOL
sequences. The versatility of this approach was demonstrated by amplification of six novel primate herpesvirus
DPOL sequences from multi-infected samples. In these
experiments, LCV DPOL and RHV DPOL amplification
was inhibited by LNA addition. Furthermore, we successfully used CMV-specific LNAs to inhibit the amplification
of human CMV DPOL and gB genes and an LCV-specific
LNA to inhibit the amplification of ORF11 of LCV (Sandra
Prepens, Merlin Deckers, Katja Spieß and Bernhard Ehlers,
unpublished data). We concluded that the amplification
of every HV gene might be accessible to inhibition by
LNAs.
LNA-containing oligonucleotides exhibit varying efficacies and specificities with regards to their inhibitory
potential. Several factors may account for these differences: The primary sequence, the number of introduced
LNA bases and their position within the oligonucleotide,
and the secondary structures of the templates. We positioned most LNAs at the 3'- end of the second round
amplification product, as this is the region of the highest
sequence diversity among the amplification products of
the panherpes DPOL PCR. However, we accepted possible
interferences by secondary structures in some PCR templates. This may account for the fact that the LNA-EBV was
10 times more effective than LNA-PtroLCV1 and that 2
other LNAs had only partial inhibitory activity (data not
shown).
The positioning of the LNA-binding region to the comparatively variable 3'-end of the second round amplimer
allowed the amplification of HV DPOL sequences that differ only slightly from the LNA-targeted HV DPOL
sequence. In artificial template mixtures, closely related
HV sequences with only 2 to 3 mismatches in the LNAbinding site could be selectively dissected by LNA addition. Furthermore, the novel PhamLCV-3 DPOL sequence
was found in an organ sample, which was also positive for
PhamLCV-2. Both sequences differ by only 3 bases in the
LNA-binding site. The LNA selectivity was likely supported by insertion of LNA bases exactly at mismatch
positions as illustrated by the higher specificity of the
LNA-GgorLCV1 (LNA substitutions at both mismatch
positions; Figure 2) compared to that of the LNAPtroLCV1 (no LNA substitution at the mismatch position;
Figure 2). Similar positional effects were reported using
LNA-substituted oligonucleotides as real-time PCR probes
[15,27]. Of course the selective placement of LNA bases at

mismatch positions cannot be carried out for unknown
sequences. Here, it is left to chance.
For inhibition of MfasLCV-1 and CgueLCV-1 amplification, we used an LNA targeting the 5'-end of the amplification product. This region is more conserved than the 3'end and does not allow for discrimination of closely
related sequences. However, non-LCV sequences (RHV or
CMV) were to be amplified in both cases, and therefore a
single, more conserved LNA was suitable in both experiments.
The LNA technique was supplemented with amplification
of the gB gene, using different sets of genus-specific primers. With these, the amplification of 8 novel primate gB
sequences was achieved. Besides their general usefulness,
both detection approaches have specific constraints. Different sets of degenerate, genus-specific gB primers can in
principle amplify as many herpesvirus gB sequences from
a single sample as herpesvirus genera for a certain host
species exist. However, this can become laborious as
exemplified by primate herpesviruses. Two alpha-, two
beta- and two gammaherpesvirus genera are known
requiring at least 6 nested sets of gB primers. Furthermore,
viruses of quite similar sequence will exhibit an identity of
close to 100% in the binding regions of the consensus
primers. Therefore, they cannot be differentiated from the
same sample by gB PCR (without LNA addition).
In contrast to gB PCR, pan-herpes DPOL PCR in the presence of a sequence-specific LNA could differentiate
between very similar DPOL genes from the same genus.
An artificial mixture of four similar LCV templates could
be dissected by the addition of three LNAs, and two very
similar LCVs were found in a baboon spleen sample
(PhamLCV-2 without LNA; PhamLCV- 3 with LNA). Furthermore, simultaneous addition of two LNAs resulted in
the exclusion of two viruses (PtroRHV-1 and PtroLCV-1)
and enabled the amplification of a third virus (PtroRHV2) from a single organ sample (Figure 4). Based on this
data we speculate that at least four herpesvirus species
might be discovered in a single sample. However, when
viruses like CgueCMV-1.1 and CgueCMV-1.2 are simultaneously present which do not differ in their DPOL but
only in their gB genes, differentiation would only be possible by (LNA-supplemented) amplification of the gB
gene.
For robust phylogenetic tree construction, the parallel targeting of two conserved genes like DPOL and gB is superior to approaches used previously [11,7,28]. In those
reports, the initial short DPOL consensus sequence of
<200 bp was extended in upstream direction by about 300
bp with 2 rounds of semi-nested, semi-specific PCR. This
had resulted in a contiguous sequence of approximately

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/84

480 bp. Although this had improved the probability of
phylogenetic trees, the whole approach still yielded limited additional sequence information. Here we present
amplification of >3 kb sequences which encode for
approximately 350 aa of gB and 750 aa of DPOL. Such
data allows for the construction of phylogenetic trees of
significantly higher probability as exemplified by the tree
of primate beta- and gammaherpesviruses presented here
(Fig. 6).
The colobus monkey was infected with two different
strains of cytomegalovirus in many organs. Presently, we
do not know whether this double CMV infection contributed to the death of the animal. In humans, the simultaneous infection with different herpesviruses is not
uncommon and was linked to enhanced pathogenicity
and disease impact [29-32]. Moreover, mixed gB genotypes of human CMV (HCMV) were found in immunocompromised patients [33], and specific HCMV gB
genotypes were associated with several human diseases
[reviewed by [34]]. Therefore, technology for differentiating unknown viruses or unknown variants of recognized
viruses in clinical specimens is needed, and this requirement adds to the importance of the presented methodology.
Very little information is available on the spectrum of
viruses in primates living in their natural habitats [35].
The LNA methodology, presented here, may become an
effective tool to comprehensively screen primates for
unknown pathogens, in particular those with zoonotic
potential.
Finally we predict that this novel technical approach is in
principle applicable to dissect mixed infections with
viruses from every viral family.
