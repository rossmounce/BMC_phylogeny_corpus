Abstract
Background: Biology has increasingly recognized the necessity to build and utilize larger
phylogenies to address broad evolutionary questions. Large phylogenies have facilitated the
discovery of differential rates of molecular evolution between trees and herbs. They have helped
us understand the diversification patterns of mammals as well as the patterns of seed evolution. In
addition to these broad evolutionary questions there is increasing awareness of the importance of
large phylogenies for addressing conservation issues such as biodiversity hotspots and response to
global change. Two major classes of methods have been employed to accomplish the large treebuilding task: supertrees and supermatrices. Although these methods are continually being
developed, they have yet to be made fully accessible to comparative biologists making extremely
large trees rare.
Results: Here we describe and demonstrate a modified supermatrix method termed megaphylogeny that uses databased sequences as well as taxonomic hierarchies to make extremely large
trees with denser matrices than supermatrices. The two major challenges facing large-scale
supermatrix phylogenetics are assembling large data matrices from databases and reconstructing
trees from those datasets. The mega-phylogeny approach addresses the former as the latter is
accomplished by employing recently developed methods that have greatly reduced the run time of
large phylogeny construction. We present an algorithm that requires relatively little human
intervention. The implemented algorithm is demonstrated with a dataset and phylogeny for
Asterales (within Campanulidae) containing 4954 species and 12,033 sites and an rbcL matrix for
green plants (Viridiplantae) with 13,533 species and 1,401 sites.
Conclusion: By examining much larger phylogenies, patterns emerge that were otherwise unseen.
The phylogeny of Viridiplantae successfully reconstructs major relationships of vascular plants that
previously required many more genes. These demonstrations underscore the importance of using
large phylogenies to uncover important evolutionary patterns and we present a fast and simple
method for constructing these phylogenies.

Background
All species on Earth – current estimates exceed 1.8 million
– are related through common ancestors in the evolutionary Tree of Life. The construction of this phylogeny is a
major endeavor for biology and largely now depends on
the unprecedented growth of molecular sequence data
available in public databases. Efforts focused on single
clades, whole genome sequencing, genomic library construction (ESTs, BACs), and large collaborative efforts,
such as NSF's Assembling the Tree of Life project, are contributing to the fast-paced growth of public databases,
with more than 92 million sequences stored in the current
release of GenBank (release 167). Current efforts to infer
really large phylogenetic trees center on data combination
using so-called supertree [e.g., [1]] and supermatrix methods [e.g., [2-4]] as opposed to using a single gene (or multiple genes) sampled very widely across taxa [e.g., [5,6]].
For example, recent large-scale database-enabled phylogenetic analyses employing these approaches have shed
light on the radiation and early evolution of mammals
[1], and the phylogenetic diversity of Bacteria [3]. Recent
advances in phylogenetic tree-building methods have provided the necessary first steps in approaching the problem
of producing large and comprehensive phylogenetic trees
[7-9]. However, assembling large datasets from databases
remains a critical problem upstream of the tree-building
process.

analysis of the final data-matrix [20]. Given the fact that
few genes are sampled very completely across many taxa,
supermatrix methods often sacrifice completeness in the
interest of size. In fact, one of the largest supermatrices,
with >2000 tips, had 95% missing data [4]. Other supermatrix analyses have focused on the number of gene
regions and not on the number of species [2,3]. The construction of a large supermatrix involves a number of
computationally challenging steps including, but not limited to, database operations, BLAST comparisons,
sequence clustering, multiple sequence alignment, and
combining data sets. An exhaustive discussion of these
steps is presented elsewhere [4], but each will be briefly
touched upon as it relates to the approach presented here.
Typically, sequences have been deposited in a database
and all-by-all sequence comparisons with BLAST are conducted to assemble sequence clusters based on similarity.
Methods for this step include agglomerative procedures,
like single linkage clustering (e.g. blastclust) and stochastic methods (e.g. Tribe-MCL; [21]). Clustered sequences
are then submitted to multiple sequence alignment
(MSA). There are a host of other procedures that can be
conducted once multiple sequence alignments are produced, especially related to identifying sequence orthology. Multi-locus datasets are created from individual
alignments that do not have "too many" missing entries
using a bipartite graph of taxa and loci and combining
with bicliques or quasi-bicliques [22,23].

Supertree methods compile many source trees with partially overlapping taxa into a single comprehensive tree
[10,11]. Generally, each source topology is converted into
a data matrix and combined with other topological matrices. Many different algorithms exist for creating the final
supertree including MRP (matrix representation with parsimony; [12,13]), MRF (matrix representation with flipping; [14]), MinCut [15], and modified MinCut [16].
Although straightforward, supertree methods are not
without their limitations, including problems related to
data independence (same data can contribute to more
than one source tree), "signal enhancement" ([11] novel
relationships in supertrees contradicting one or several
source trees), and the assessment of uncertainty and confidence in relationships [17]. In addition, supertrees are
strictly topological, thus requiring sequence data to obtain
useful branch lengths [1]. Most importantly however,
supertrees do not directly rely on the primary data for tree
inference, making novel topologies suspect. Perhaps due
to these limitations, and despite active development of
methodologies [e.g., [1]], few large supertrees for diverse
groups have been successfully constructed (but see
[18,19]).

Each step described above is computationally difficult and
rarely has been discussed in the context of what might be
optimal for the final goal of tree construction. Despite the
computational difficulties and potential shortcomings of
specific steps in their construction, supermatrix methods
allow for simultaneous data analysis. Also, unlike supertrees, they do not suffer from data independence or "signal enhancement" problems, and, at least in principle,
confidence can be assessed using standard bootstrapping
approaches. However, problems related to missing data
and assessing the quality of the trees produced persists.
Tools addressing certain steps of supermatrix construction
are beginning to become available (e.g., Phylota; [24])
and some notable large trees have been successfully produced [4]. However, tools for constructing supermatrices
are not readily available for comparative biologists, and
rather few large matrices for specific clades have been successfully analyzed. Nevertheless, supermatrix methods
have made enormous strides forward and recent discussions have begun to center on methods that combine elements of both supertree and supermatrix approaches [e.g.
[17,25,26]].

Supermatrix methods, on the other hand, are directly
inferred from the sequence data through the construction
of a large multiple sequence alignment for simultaneous

The method introduced here, to which we refer to as a
"mega-phylogeny", is most similar to supermatrix methods, but differs from previous methods used to create

large matrices in a number of ways. The mega-phylogeny
method relies on the user identifying the gene regions of
interest by presenting actual examples of the gene region
and the breadth of molecular diversity of that gene within
the clade of interest. Also, the mega-phylogeny method
employs profile alignments to combine alignments of
orthologous gene regions that would either be poorly
aligned if done across a broad taxonomic group or would
be broken up by clustering analyses. The mega-phylogeny
approach can quickly create enormous phylogenetic
matrices as more data from the same gene may be used,
and the problems associated with sequence saturation are
specifically attenuated. The first demonstration of this
method [27] produced phylogenies for plant clades from
366 species and 11,374 sites (Dipsacales) to 4657 species
and 22,391 sites (Commelinidae).
Here, we describe this new approach and its current
implementation. We also present two example phylogenies for two plant clades created using our method: an
Asterales phylogeny containing 4954 species and five gene
regions and an rbcL phylogeny of green plants (Viridiplantae) comprising more than 13,533 species.

Methods
Implemented Pipeline
The basic steps for a mega-phylogeny include (1) designating the clade of interest, (2) identifying the gene
region(s) of interest, (3) recording the extent of molecular
diversity of the gene region in the clade of interest, (4)
recording the threshold of coverage and identity to be
used for orthology tests, (5) narrowing the possible
sequences with a very broad term search [optional], (6)
remove all potential sequences that are not members of
the clade of interest, (7) testing orthology by BLASTing
each potential sequence to each gene region identified for
the breadth and removing those sequences that differ by
more than the established threshold, (8) identifying
sequences that should be reverse complemented, (9)
removing sequences for duplicate taxon names, keeping
the sequence with the best coverage and identity, and (10)
test for saturation. If the sequences are saturated, subdivide them using the next available subclade and perform
additional tests of saturation (step 10). Finally, once all of
the sequences are in an alignment or exist as singletons
(i.e. are not found to be contained in any subdivisions),
profile each alignment to a master alignment. This can be
repeated an arbitrary number of times for each gene
region of interest. If multiple gene regions are used, these
are then concatenated into a large matrix and the phylogeny inferred.

We implemented this pipeline in Python (vers. 2.5) with
the BioPython (vers. 1.48) module and using the BioSQL
(vers. 1.0.1) database schema. Each mega-phylogeny

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/37

matrix assembly analysis presented here was run on a
Linux laptop with 1 GB RAM and a 2.4 Ghz dual-core
processor. The phylogenetic analyses were conducted on
an eight-way SMP Linux computer with 2.4 Ghz processors and 32 GB of RAM using RAxML (vers. 7.0.4; [8]). The
steps that are novel for matrix assembly are described
briefly below.
Orthology
Determining whether sequences are orthologous is a challenge for large tree construction. Supermatrix methods
have attempted to overcome this problem by identifying
orthologous sets of sequences using clustering techniques
[2,4], but these can be time consuming and are typically
not developed with the goal of large phylogeny assembly
[e.g., [28]]. Here, we determine orthologous sequences
using designated sequences representing the breadth of
variation observed in the gene region of interest across the
clade of interest. We BLAST all of the potential sequences
from the database against these designated sequences and
other potential sequences that are determined to match
with a certain threshold (i.e. according to both coverage
and identity). At this stage, reverse complements are corrected by determining which direction best matches the
designated regions of interest. Instead of N × N comparisons between each potentially useful sequence, only N ×
n comparisons are necessary, where n is the number of
example sequences used to represent the region. This dramatically shortened the run time of the algorithm as well
as generally produced denser matrices.
Profile alignments
One major problem for large matrices using broadly sampled sequences or smaller matrices with quickly evolving
sequences is that multiple sequence alignments become
more challenging as sequences become more divergent
[28,29]. Almost all multiple sequence alignment algorithms build a phylogeny during the estimation procedures [30]. The phylogenies built for multiple sequence
alignment are often based on model-corrected or raw pairwise distances. These methods are susceptible to problems
with saturation (i.e. multiple mutations at the same site
for the same organism) and are therefore much less accurate for large and broadly sampled alignments that are
likely to contain very distantly related sequences. The
quality of multiple sequence alignments can have a dramatic impact on the accuracy of the phylogenies produced
[e.g., [31-33]]. As a result, other supermatrix methods
sidestep multiple sequence alignment by employing clustering techniques to determine "alignable regions." Such
clustering techniques have allowed for the assembly of
very large matrices of sufficiently similar sequences
[2,4,34]. This approach can be dramatically affected by
the parameters used during clustering, sometimes resulting in multiple informative clusters for slower gene

regions (e.g. two large rbcL clusters for Ericales in Phylota).
We combine the analysis of sequence saturation with
recent advances in multiple profile-to-profile alignment
methodology. A profile alignment is an algorithmic
approach to identifying structural elements that are highly
conserved between different alignments [34-36]. To
accomplish this, separate alignments are aligned together
while preserving the columns in the individual alignments. Newer profile alignment programs allow for more
flexibility in profile alignment procedures (e.g. MAFFT;
[37]). In our case, we separate sequences into subgroups
of aligned sequences based on the degree of sequence saturation. For example, if the algorithm determines that the
most inclusive group of sequences is saturated, then the
group is broken up into less inclusive groups using the
next level in the taxonomic hierarchy. In a Linnaean taxonomic system, if an "order" is found to be saturated, it
would be broken into "families". Each smaller subset of
sequences is then re-aligned and the saturation reassessed.
This process continues iteratively to less inclusive groups
until sequences no longer appear saturated and these
alignments are then stored. We note, however, that the
taxonomic groups used in this procedure need not correspond to ranks in the Linnaean hierarchy, but should simply be hierarchically nested (as in the NCBI taxonomy).
Grouping using a rank-free classification (PhyloCode;
[38]) could be used and will be possible once a database
of phylogenetic names is implemented and usable. After
every sequence has been either placed in an alignment or
placed as a "singleton," the individual alignments are
then profiled to a larger alignment. The order of the profiling can be random, optimized to find the best order, or
aided by a hierarchical "guide" tree (e.g. first aligning
more closely related matrices). Currently, we employ
highly conservative guide trees based on published studies to carry out profile alignments.
Assessing saturation
We introduce a simple method based on dispersion statistics to rapidly detect saturation across a set of sequence
data. Dispersion (an indicator of spread) is assessed on
the one-dimensional Euclidean distance between the raw
pair-wise sequence distances and those corrected according to a Jukes-Cantor model of molecular substitution. A
one-dimensional Euclidean distance is the absolute difference between two points. Our measure of dispersion is
based on the median and is commonly referred to as the
median absolute deviation (MAD) and given by

MAD = 1.4826 × Med (| xi - Med (x)|),
where the median is estimated from the residual variation
about the median of all pair-wise Euclidean distances. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/37

constant 1.4826 is used to make MAD consistent for the
standard deviation [39]. Thus, in our use, the larger the
MAD the larger the overall spread in the Euclidean distances – that is, above a certain value the assumed nucleotide substitution model is no longer adequately
accounting for the rate variation exhibited by pair-wise
distances among species.
We performed a simple simulation study to explore the
behavior of MAD. First, we wanted to determine a threshold for subdividing sequences into smaller alignments. In
addition, we wanted to compare MAD with alternative
measures of dispersion based on the sample mean (i.e.
mean square error, MSE; root mean square, RMSE).
Sequence data were simulated across randomly constructed 20- and 100-tip phylogenies. Different rates of
molecular evolution were simulated by incrementally
scaling the total tree length by a factor of 0.10, starting
from 0.10 and stopping at 2.0. All molecular simulations
were carried out using Seq-gen (Ver 1.3.2; [40]).
The results from these simulations clearly highlight the
utility of MAD. First, unlike MSE or RMSE, MAD does not
require an underlying Gaussian distribution, which is useful as the distribution of Euclidean distances becomes
skewed as the degree of sequence divergence increases. A
second advantage, and perhaps the most critical, is that
MAD appears stable when sequence divergence is unrealistically high (e.g. tree length scaled by a factor of 2; Figure
1). This situation is also analogous to the presence of outliers that have well-known influences on dispersion statistics based on the mean. Because MAD does not require an
explicit distribution and is the 50th percentile of the residual variation, it has the inherent property of being robust
to outliers (Figure 1G, H). Finally, our simulations indicate that a MAD exceeding ~0.01 provided a conservative
indication of a saturation level necessitating a profile
alignment scheme.

Results
Asterales
Nearly 10% of all angiosperms are contained within the
Asterales; a clade that is mainly comprised of 12 recognized families with a majority of the diversity being attributed to just two families, Asteraceae (e.g. sunflowers,
thistles) and Campanulaceae (e.g. Lobelia and relatives).
The monophyly of Asterales is well supported despite
uncertainty in its position within the more inclusive Campanulidae clade [41]. There are roughly 5200 species of
Asterales represented in GenBank, or roughly 20% of the
entire clade. However, aside from studies of carefully
selected exemplar taxa representing major lineages of
Asterales [41-46], a comprehensive phylogeny has never
been produced for this clade. Here we apply our mega-

Figure 1 exploring the behavior of MAD in relation to alternative measures of dispersion
Simulation
Simulation exploring the behavior of MAD in relation to alternative measures of dispersion. Each panel is a simulation of sequence data on a balanced phylogeny of 20-(A, C, E, and G) and 100-tips (B, D, F, and H). A and B total tree length
scaled to 0.10. C and D total tree length scaled to 0.25. E and F total tree length scaled to 0.50. G and H total tree length
scaled to 2.00. Saturation was assessed by descriptors of dispersion on the one-dimensional Euclidean distance between the
raw pair-wise sequence distances (uncorrected distance) and those corrected according to a Jukes-Cantor model of molecular
substitution (corrected distance). Our simulations demonstrated that the use of the non-parametric median absolute deviation
(MAD) had several advantages of detecting saturation over alternative measures of dispersion based on the sample mean (i.e.
mean square error, MSE; root mean square, RMSE).

phylogeny approach to the Asterales to reconstruct the
most complete phylogeny of the group to date.
Our Asterales sequence matrix was comprised of rbcL,
matK, trnL-F, trnK, ndhF, and ITS. The combined matrix of
12,033 sites was comprised of 90.959% gaps or missing
sequence. However, the individual gene regions were
more variable in gap or missing sequence composition:
98.043% in ETS, 36.348% in ITS, 98.188% in matK,
90.338% in ndhF, 92.597% in rbcL, 98.002% in trnK, and
81.445% in trnL-F. Of the five gene regions sampled, ITS
was the best represented taxonomically (with 4242 species) and was the only region identified by our procedure
as requiring profile-to-profile alignments. The MAD score
indicated that the degree of ITS saturation varied among
groups, but within-group alignments were never carried
out above the traditional "tribal" level. This resulted in
180 separate within-group alignment files of differing
hierarchical level.
As an efficient means to direct the profile-to-profile alignments, we assembled a "guide" tree by compiling and
grafting together published phylogenies (sensu [47]).
Briefly, we first obtained a backbone phylogeny from
Winkworth et al., [41] and Lundberg and Bremer [44] for
the major lineages of Asterales. We then grafted trees
based on more focused studies into the backbone tree. We
started this process with the most inclusive clade and proceeding "inwards", adding more and more detailed analyses of included clades. Our final grafted tree was pruned
down to correspond to the 180-alignment files output
from our saturation analysis (see Additional file 1). This
guide tree was then traversed in a post-order fashion, performing profile-to-profile alignments starting at the "terminals" and working recursively back to the root. The
phylogeny was then inferred using RAxML (vers. 7.0.4;
[8]), partitioning for each gene region using the
GTR+GAMMA model of rate substitution.
Our final phylogeny includes 4954 tips with the branching within and among "families" being mostly consistent
with previously published results (Figure 2). One exception concerns the early branching lineages of Asterales,
involving the placement of Rousseaceae+Carpodetaceae,
Campanulaceae, and Pentaphragmataceae. The current
consensus recognizes a basal trichotomy among these
three clades ([48]; but see [41,44]). Our analysis recovered Rousseaceae+Carpodetaceae as the sister groups of
all other Asterales, within which Campanulaceae (including Lobeliaceae) is sister to the rest (Figure 2). This result
has been recovered before [44], but other studies have
suggested a basal split between Rousseaceae+Carpodetaceae plus Campanulaceae [41,44] and all the rest. Our
analysis shows Pentaphragmataceae as sister to a clade
comprising Stylidiaceae, Alseuosmiaceae, Argophyllaceae,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/37

Phellinaceae, Menyanthaceae, Goodeniaceae, Calyceraceae, and Asteraceae (Figure 2). A recent combined analysis of chloroplast and nuclear genes found strong
support for this relationship [41].
Relationships within Asteraceae coincide well the subfamilial classification of Panero and Funk [46]. However,
we note that our phylogeny does not support the monophyly of Wunderlichioideae, Stifftioideae, Mutisioideae,
or Gochnatioideae (sensu [46]). Instead we found these
groups to be broken into smaller successive sister clades to
the rest of Asteraceae.
Several relationships, within major clades, are worth noting as they highlight the utility of our method. Based on
the NCBI taxonomy, the profile-alignment portion of our
algorithm assumed that Campanula was monophyletic.
However, the MAD score detected extreme sequence variation that required profile alignments among species. This
variation is an indication of extreme molecular differentiation, and in the case of Campanula, paraphyly, which is
consistent with more focused systematic studies of Campanulaceae [49,50]. In several cases we also assumed sister
relationships where the primary literature suggested low
nodal support. For example, we profiled the genus Doronicum and the tribe Senecioneae as sister clades within the
more inclusive Asteroideae, though there is generally low
confidence in this hypothesis [51]. The resulting tree
showed these two clades to be more distantly related, as
Doronicum is placed near the early branching lineages of
Asteroideae (Figure 2). Taken together, these results show
that even though we assume some phylogenetic relationships at the outset in doing the profile alignments, our
results need not recover the same relationship within the
final phylogenetic tree.
Green plants
The green plants (Viridiplantae) contain more than
350,000 species including green algae, liverworts, mosses,
ferns, and seed plants, including the flowering plants. The
early branches of the entire clade and of each major group
of green plants have attracted extensive molecular work
[52-55]. Two large clades of living green plants are supported: Streptophyta and Chlorophyta [52]. Charophytes
(stonewarts) have been supported as the sister group to
land plants based on the inclusion of six genes [53,55].
Despite the large number of molecular studies that have
focused on deep relationships within green plants, few
studies with very large numbers of taxa have been conducted.

Here, we create a mega-phylogeny of the chloroplast ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) gene for all green
plants. This well sampled gene has been extensively examined in smaller studies throughout plants, especially in

flowering plants [beginning with 5]. Despite the widespread use of rbcL, the addition of other genes has generally been necessary to confidently reconstruct many
relationships. Here, our goal was to construct the largest
rbcL phylogeny for green plants while simultaneously
accommodating saturation across the alignment.

Over 16,000 rbcL sequences were found to be orthologous
to the designated sequences sampled throughout flowering plants. Our final matrix with duplicate taxa removed
consisted of 13,533 tips and 1401 nucleotide sites with
4.6238% of the matrix consisting of gaps. Our saturation
analysis recognized 15 separate aligned subgroupings:
Chlorophyta (486 sp.), Zygnesnophyceae (131 sp.), Coleochaetophyceae (21 sp.), Charophyceae (34 sp.), March-

sp.),
Bryophyta
(570
sp.),
Anthocerotophyta (56 sp.), Lycopodiopsida (48 sp.), Isoetopsida (101 sp.), Equisetophyta (18 sp.), Marattiopsida
(59 sp.), Ophioglossopsida (29 sp.), Filicopsida (1624
sp.), Psilotophyta (3 sp.), and Spermatophyta (9900).
These aligned subgroups were combined using profile
alignments across a guide tree based on Donoghue [56]
and Cantino et al. [38] (see additional file 2). The phylogeny was constructed using RAxML (vers. 7.0.4; [8]) using
the GTR+GAMMA model of rate substitution.
A recent analysis by Qiu et al. [55] compiled the most
comprehensive dataset to date, using six genes and 193
species to resolve relationships of the four major land
plant lineages: liverworts, hornworts, mosses, and vascular plants. They recover, with strong support, a resolution
of successive sister clades starting with liverworts, then
mosses, then hornworts, and vascular plants. Our maximum-likelihood tree of more than 13,000 species recovers this same relationship with the use of rbcL alone
(Figure 3). However, within vascular plants, our trees differ in the placement of lycophytes. In the Qiu et al. [56]
tree, monilophytes are more closely related to seed plants
than lycophytes and these relationships are well established based on other evidence (e.g., morphology [57],
gene order and gene losses [58,59]). We find the lycophytes to be more closely related to seed plants, which is
likely to be mistaken and reflects an artifact in the evolution of rbcL.
Our much larger phylogeny resolves some relationships
by including more data in the form of more species
instead of more genes. This has been documented previously but has rarely been tested on such a large scale
[60,61]. With the inclusion of more taxa other broad evolutionary patterns emerge [cf. [27]]. For example, in this
case, the ferns appear to have faster rates of evolution than
the other vascular plants. Further study is required to
quantify this pattern and its important, as the timing and
rate of evolution of ferns has been interpreted in light of
angiosperm evolution [62]. With more taxa sampled, rate
heterogeneity can become more apparent, raising an
important issue about the possible effects of clade-specific
rates on divergence-time estimates [27]. Unfortunately,
accurate estimates of divergence times using tens of thousands of species remain impractical.
Another important result is that rbcL appears to be saturated across green plants. That is, despite the conservative
nature of this coding region, when looking very broadly
there are likely to be multiple mutations at sites throughout the gene causing either less accurate multiple
sequence alignments or causing clustering methods to
break up the matrix into smaller sections. Broad analyses
of green plants will need to take this into account. Our

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/37

analysis also demonstrates the limitations of conventional computers for analyzing large phylogenies. The
matrix manipulation, tree construction, and tree rerooting
required at least 8 GB of memory and were conducted on
an 8 CPU machine. To build even larger matrices, more
memory and faster machines will be essential.

Discussion and conclusion
The examples presented here demonstrate the utility of
our strategy for building large phylogenetic trees. The
mega-phylogeny method is capable of producing large
and somewhat denser phylogenetic matrices with the
addition of human intervention in the selection of gene
regions. These matrices can be a partitioned multi-locus
dataset, as in the Asterales example, or a single-locus analysis of tens of thousands of terminals, as in the green
plants. The size is limited only by computing power. Also,
our examples illustrate how well sampled regions (such as
ITS) that may be evolving too fast for traditional multiple
sequence alignment may be included in broad phylogenetic analyses. Our mega-phylogeny approach also demonstrates that the addition of many more taxa can help
resolve relationships where, traditionally, more genes
would be required. A direct comparison of our mega-phylogeny method to trees constructed from supermatrix
methods is difficult as the two approaches have somewhat
different goals. Supermatrix methods can, as implemented by McMahon and Sanderson [[4], also see [2,3]],
attempt to make the largest matrix from a database of
sequences without specifically identifying particular
regions of interest. The mega-phylogeny approach
attempts to make the matrix with the largest number of
taxa for any clade given the gene regions pre-identified as
being of interest. This allows for the creation of somewhat
denser matrices, faster. Because fewer gene regions would,
in general, be used in the mega-phylogeny approach, partitioned likelihood analyses can be employed more easily
with shorter run times. At the moment, there is no standard software for supermatrix methods that could be
benchmarked against the mega-phylogeny approach.
Our mega-phylogeny method will perhaps be most useful
for comparative biology. In recent years there is an emerging interest in compiling broad-scale datasets to identify
general patterns and test specific hypotheses using a phylogenetic framework. For example, new and interesting
patterns have emerged in topics ranging from molecular
rates [27] to ecophysiology [63-65] to biodiversity [66]
and ecosystem processes [67]. However, the level of resolution in the underlying phylogeny has limited many of
these studies with many being constructed from multiple
literature-based trees (e.g. Phylomatic; [68]). Our method
provides a means to construct large phylogenies from primary data, which we hope will facilitate more sophisticated and robust comparative analyses. This has been

demonstrated with rate heterogeneity in plants [27]. The
limiting factor may soon become the ability of software
for various comparative analyses to handle mega-phylogenies.
Modularity
The mega-phylogeny method is inherently modular, making each step easily extensible. For example, instead of
using BLAST comparisons for sequence orthology tests,
another test could be used. In fact, a modified clustering
method, as is typically found in supermatrix construction,
could be utilized. Additionally, instead of the MAD measurement for saturation, other measures could be devised.
Concomitantly, any number of different taxonomic databases can be used when saturation is detected. We have
relied on the NCBI hierarchical taxonomy, but increased
precision might eventually be obtained by using a system
containing many additional levels. The modularity of the
mega-phylogeny approach encourages its longevity when
better methods and approaches become available to
address specific procedures underlying mega-phylogeny
matrix creation.

Modularity is especially important with respect to the
guide trees involved in profile alignment, where the
results from different guide trees (or no guide tree) can be
compared. For example, there may be a published study
of broadly sampled taxa included in the clade of interest
for the mega-phylogeny approach. A profile alignment
using this tree could easily be compared to one that consists only of basal polytomies, which will be profiled randomly. The use of guide trees for this step highlights the
need for available definitive bifurcating trees for profile
alignments, especially broadly sampled trees. From this
perspective, the compilation of large-scale trees from published phylogenies (e.g., available on TreeBASE, http://
www.treebase.org) becomes a highly relevant endeavor,
not only from the standpoint of the initial guide tree but
also as a basis for the comparison of results. Important
differences could then highlight areas in special need of
attention. For example, further attention is needed to the
signal in rbcL that places lycophytes with seed plants.
Potential pitfalls
A key element of our mega-phylogeny method is its reliance on prior knowledge of phylogenetic relationships
when performing profile-to-profile alignments. We
assume that each group being aligned is monophyletic,
which is potentially a problem once saturation is detected
and less inclusive multiple sequence alignments are
employed. However, despite such assumptions, our saturation analysis using the MAD statistic is not irreversibly
susceptible to outliers and can detect extreme variation
when, for example, it is not monophyletic as demonstrated with Campanula within our Asterales matrix. In

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/37

this case, the MAD score suggested that the assumption of
monophyly for Campanula was violated, and it emerged as
paraphyletic in the final tree. Even though the assumption
of monophyly is a potential problem, it is not always detrimental. Further work is needed to explore the sensitivity
of the results to such assumptions. In the meantime, the
approach highlights the need for taxonomic databases to
most accurately reflect current best knowledge of phylogenetic relationships.
Various problems identified in supermatrix construction
may also pertain to the mega-phylogeny method. For
example, there are problems with database-enabled phylogenetics that are hard or impossible to avoid, such as
misidentification or mislabeling in GenBank [4].
Sequence orthology tests can help identify such problems,
however outliers are likely to still cause difficulties in
some matrices. Additionally, there are potential problems
with "rogue taxa" that can lower resolution and support
throughout the tree. However, the problem of rogue taxa
continues to also be a problem for supermatrices and
therefore the development of solutions will likely benefit
both methods.
Extensions
It may be possible to incorporate diversity estimates for
each taxonomic group, such that large clades represented
by single (or a few) species for a particular gene could be
excluded. This would likely reduce problems associated
with rogue taxa. Although this information is not currently readily available, its inclusion could greatly increase
the efficacy of the mega-phylogeny approach.

Our method can also be extended to deal with the problem of sequence outliers. Unfortunately, the size of the
matrices that can be constructed makes checking for outliers by hand impractical. But saturation statistics could be
extended to identify these outliers in the individual gene
regions. Although the orthology tests and reverse complement procedures identify the vast majority of problematic
sequences, the MAD statistic has the potential to cleanse
the datasets further, allowing for almost complete automation of large tree construction.
Finally, the mega-phylogeny procedure can be parallelized. Many of the procedures related to sequence-tosequence comparisons (e.g., orthology tests, reverse complements) can be easily distributed on multiple CPU's or
computers. This is also true of some of the multiple
sequence alignment calculations. Parallelizing these procedures would yield even faster the mega-phylogenic analyses.
