Abstract
Background: The domestic goat is one of the important livestock species of India. In the present
study we assess genetic diversity of Indian goats using 17 microsatellite markers. Breeds were
sampled from their natural habitat, covering different agroclimatic zones.
Results: The mean number of alleles per locus (NA) ranged from 8.1 in Barbari to 9.7 in Jakhrana
goats. The mean expected heterozygosity (He) ranged from 0.739 in Barbari to 0.783 in Jakhrana
goats. Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) were statistically significant (P < 0.05)
for 5 loci breed combinations. The DA measure of genetic distance between pairs of breeds
indicated that the lowest distance was between Marwari and Sirohi (0.135). The highest distance
was between Pashmina and Black Bengal. An analysis of molecular variance indicated that 6.59% of
variance exists among the Indian goat breeds. Both a phylogenetic tree and Principal Component
Analysis showed the distribution of breeds in two major clusters with respect to their geographic
distribution.
Conclusion: Our study concludes that Indian goat populations can be classified into distinct
genetic groups or breeds based on the microsatellites as well as mtDNA information.

Background
Goats, like other livestock species, are recognised as
important components of world diversity and may play a
useful role in sustainable agriculture in future. The goats
in India are distributed in all climatic regions and evolved
in isolation for a long period due to varying selective pressures and genetic drift. Goat breeds are mainly defined by
their geographical position, morphological characteristics
and production performance. Goats in India can also be
divided into large, medium and small breeds, which are
mainly distributed into four major geographical regions:
temperate Himalayan region, northwestern region, south-

ern peninsular region and eastern region [1]. Goat breeds
have also been classified based on their production status:
milk producing, meat producing and dual type. In addition to this, considerable variation exists among goat populations in terms of size, coat colour, ear, horn pattern
and production performance. In the present study we
have included all major goat breeds of India, representing
diverse production characteristics (Fig 1 and Table 1). The
Jamunapari breed is known as the best Indian dairy goat
[2] and is found in isolated pockets in the Chakarnagar
area of the Etawah district of Uttar Pradesh (UP). The
Jakhrana, also known for high milk yield, is from the

An assessment of genetic variability in domestic goats is a
first step towards conservation of genetic resources for
maintaining breeding options. In the changing phase of
agricultural practices, a few breeds have been used on a
large scale for immediate economic gain. Therefore,
locally adapted native breeds have been neglected or displaced without knowing their genetic importance. DNA
markers have been used to study the genetic variation in
livestock, human and other populations [3-5]. Genetic
markers are used to determine genetic variation between
breeds; subsequently relationships among breeds are
determined in calculating genetic distance and constructing trees. Microsatellite markers have been used as good
tools to analyse the genetic variation in cattle, sheep, pig,
and goats [6-11]. Using the maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence information, we have
demonstrated earlier the existence of all the three previously known lineages A, B, C and proposed two new lineages among Indian goat populations [12]. However, no
study has been conducted on Indian goats using the
nuclear microsaltellite/short tandem repeats (STR) loci
and covering a wide set of populations from different
agroclimatic zones on Indian goats. Therefore, we have
characterized seven economically important Indian goat
breeds using STR markers.

Results
Alwar area of Rajasthan. The Barbari is a medium size
dual-purpose breed known for its adaptability over a wide
range agro-climatic situation. The Sirohi is a medium to
large size breed and is used for both meat and milk in its
natural habitat. The Marwari is a medium size breed and
is known for hardiness and adaptability to extreme temperature. The Black Bengal is the typical dwarf breed of
eastern India and known for high prolificacy and meat
quality. Pashmina goats are distributed in high altitude of
Himalayan region and known for the best fibre production. In addition to the major breeds, there are many
intermediate and less distinguishable goat subtypes; however the genetic relationship among the major types as
well as subtypes has not been established.

Genetic variation in Indian goats
Out of 23 STR markers analysed, 4 failed to amplify in any
of the samples, 2 showed monomorphic patterns and the
remaining 17 were polymorphic. The total number of
alleles and allele size range for each locus are presented in
Table 2. Among the polymorphic markers, the BM4621
and SRCRSP9 loci showed the highest number of alleles
(more than 20) in the populations analyzed. The
IDVGA7, BM6526, INRABERN192, TGLA40 and
SRCRSP5 loci showed more than 15 alleles. The remaining 10 loci showed less than 15 alleles. Locus SRCRSP10
exhibited the smallest number of alleles (9). The total
number of alleles varied from 9 (SRCRSP10) to 22
(BM4621). In total, 248 alleles were observed from 17
loci surveyed.

Genetic variation within breeds
The most polymorphism was detected at the SRCRSP9
locus (0.85) and the least polymorphism at the ILST S005
locus (0.597). Breed specific alleles were observed at different loci for different breeds with low frequency. Measures of genetic variability are shown in Table 3. Average
observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.375
to 0.426 and 0.739 to 0.783, respectively. The mean
expected heterozygosity (He) ranged from 0.739 in Barbari to 0.783 in the Jakhrana breed. The Barbari showed
the lowest gene diversity, while the Jakhrana and Sirohi
showed the highest gene diversity among Indian goats.
Wilcoxon's signed ranks test indicated that He was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in Barbari goats than in other
breeds.

The mean number of alleles per locus (NA) varied from
8.1 in Barbari to 9.7 in Jakhrana goats. The mean number
of alleles per locus (NA) corrected for sample size (calculated based on n = 31) is presented in Table 3. The comparison between both estimates was different in some
breeds due to variation in sample size. The most diverse
goat breeds were the Jakhrana and Sirohi, which had the

highest total number of alleles (TNA) of 165 and 162 and
highest mean number of alleles (MNA) of 9.7 and 9.3,
respectively. The least diverse breed was the Pashmina,
which had the lowest TNA of 129 and the lowest MNA of
7.6. Average and expected heterozygosity was lowest in
the Pashmina. Similarly the Jakhrana and Sirohi had the
highest expected heterozygosity of 0.783 and 0.782,
respectively. However, the Marwari had higher observed
heterozygosity than the Jakhrana and Sirohi. Deviations
from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) were statistically significant (P < 0.05) for 5 loci breed combinations.
These loci included one each in Barbari (ILSTS 005),
Jamunapari (ILSTS 005), Black Bengal (SRCRSP10), and
Pashmina (Oar HH56) and Marwari (ETH 225). However, the total number of significant deviations was below
the 5% level in each population.
FST values for each pair of populations varied from 0.036
to 0.088. The average GST values over all loci was 0.080,
indicating that a 8.0% of total genetic variation corresponded to differences among populations, whereas
92.0% was explained by difference among individuals.

model) over the loci was 0.177. Mean pairwise comparisons between breeds showed that RST values were 2–4
folds higher than GST values. An exact test for population
differentiation for all pairs of breeds across all loci showed
that all breeds were significantly (P < 0.001) different
from each other.
Further, an AMOVA analysis was carried out to analyze the
variation within and between breeds. The AMOVA
revealed that percentage of variation among populations
was 6.59% and within populations was 93.41%. Variance
components among population were highly significant
for all the studied loci (Table 4), demonstrating significant geographical structuring in Indian goats. ILSTS005
and BM4621 contributed 14.42% and 11.50% variability
among populations, respectively, and SRCRSP6 and
NRAMP showed the lowest variability among populations
(2.26% and 3.28%, respectively).
Genetic distance
Allele frequencies were used to generate the DA genetic
distance between each pair of populations and distance
matrices were used to build phylogenetic trees using the
UPGMA and NJ algorithms. As both trees retained similar
structure, only the NJ tree constructed from a matrix of DA
distances is presented in Figure 2. The DA genetic distances
and Fst distances between pairs of breeds are shown in
Table 5. The lowest distance was observed between Marwari-Sirohi (0.135) and Jamunapari-Jakhrana. The highest distance was observed between Pashmina and
BlackBengal and between Barbari and Black Bengal. The
NJ tree revealed two different clusters (Fig. 2). The first
cluster consisted of the Marwari and Sirohi breeds, and
the 2nd cluster consisted of the Jamunapari, Black Bengal
and Jakhrana breeds. Bootstrap values ranged from 40 to
78 indicating reliable topology of the phylogeny constructed from DA distances. Barbari and Pashmina goats
were placed separately in the phylogenetic tree.
Principal component analysis
Single-marker analyses
PCA was performed for each of the 17 markers. Corresponding scree plots are presented in Figure 3. Splitting up
the inertia according to axes leads to the so-called scree
plot. A scree plot is a simple line segment plot that shows
the fraction of total variance in the data as explained or

represented by each Principal Component. Contribution
of a marker to the construction of an axis is measured by
the part of the inertia of this axis that is supplied by the
marker. Splitting up the inertia of an axis according to
markers enables one to evaluate the degree of consensus
of this axis. The inertia was different according to the
markers. The most important markers were ILSTS005,
BM4621 and SRCRSP10, while, the markers Nramp,
OARAE101 and SRCRSP9 did not contribute significantly
to inertia. For each single-marker analysis, distances
among breeds were computed. Distances were unequal
among populations (Kruskall-Wallis test, χ2 = 29.45, 20
d.f, P = 0.08), indicating the existence of a multivariate
compromise structure.
Global Analysis
PCA was performed using the frequencies of the 242 alleles of the 17 markers. The first three principal components
explained 65% of the total variation. The global principal
component analysis for the first three principal components is presented in Figure 4. The first axis contributed
about 27% of the inertia and distinguished the Pashmina
and Barbari populations from the other populations,
especially the Black Bengal. The second axis contributed
20% of the inertia and separated a cluster containing Barbari, Jamunapari, Jakhrana, and Black Bengal, from a cluster containing Pashmina, Sirohi and Marwari. The third
axis contributed about 18% of the inertia and again distinguished a cluster containing Sirohi and Marwari from
the breeds Jamunapari, Jakhrana and Black Bengal, but
differs from the second axis by the different positions of
Barbari and Pahsmina. As a result, these three axes
revealed a pattern of association that supports a partition
of populations into 4 discrete groups: (1) Barbari, (2)
Pashmina, (3) Jamunapari, Jakhrana and Black Bengal
and (4) Sirohi and Marwari (Figure 3)
Contributions of markers to the global analysis
The contributions of markers to the construction of axes
are plotted in Figure 5. Contributions to axes are variable
for all the three axes. Not surprisingly, markers with the
greatest inertia contributed the most to the construction
of axes: ILSTS005 contributed 20% to the construction of
first axis, while BM4621 and SRCRSP10 together contributed 35% (axis 2) and 30% (axis 3). Due to the importance of these three markers, it may be interesting to detail

their contributions. Contributions of SRCRSP10 to the
three axes were roughly comparable. The corresponding
PCA plot indicates that this single-marker tyology shared
the most features with the global one, i.e. the separation
between Pashmina and Barbari and the separation
between these two populations and the others.
On the other hand, BM4621 and ILST005 participated in
the construction of only one or two axes. ILSTS005 participated in the construction of the first axis. The corresponding PCA plot indicates that Pashmina and Barbari breeds
were isolated from some other populations, as in the fist
axis of the global analysis, but the clusters Jakhrana, Jamunapari, Black Bengal and Sirohi, Marwari were not exhibited by this marker. On the other hand, BM4621, which
contributes to the construction of the second and third
axes, exhibited these clusters, but did not isolate the Bar-

bari and Pashmina breeds. BM4621 revealed three clusters
(Pashmina, Barbari, other breeds) in contrast to the four
clusters exhibited by the global analysis (Pashmina, Barbari, Black Bengal and Jamnuapari, Jakhrana).

Discussion
Breed differentiation
Our genetic analysis of seven Indian goat breeds with 17
microsatellite markers showed higher gene diversity as
compared to European and Asian goat breeds. Barker,
1994 [13] and Takezaki and Nei, 1996 [14] suggested that
microsatellite loci for genetic diversity studies should have
more than four alleles in order to reduce the standard
error estimates of genetic distance. The total number of
alleles per locus in the present study ranged from 9 to 22.
This higher number of alleles for each locus suggested that
all the markers used were appropriate to analyse diversity

in Indian goats. The mean number of alleles observed
over a range of loci in different populations was considered to be a reasonable indicator of genetic variation
within the populations [3]. A more appropriate measure
of genetic variation within a population was gene diversity (average expected heterozygosity) [15]. Gene diversity
for each breed ranged from 0.724 in Barbari to 0.783 in

Jakhrana. Takezaki and Nei, 1996 [14] determined that
for markers to be useful for measuring genetic variation,
they should have an average heterozygosity ranging from
0.3 to 0.8 in the populations. This again confirmed that
these markers were appropriate for measuring genetic variation. By analysing mitochondrial HVR1 region in our
previous study [12], the lowest haplotype diversity was

observed in Pashmina goats (0.926) and the highest haplotype diversity was observed in Jamunapari goats. Microsatellite analysis also revealed that the Pashmina goats
exhibited the lowest diversity as compared to other breeds
in the present study. The measures of population differentiation indicated variability within breeds and the exact
test for population differentiation indicated significant
differences between breeds. We observed a large, significant difference between expected and observed heterozygosities in all the Indian goat breeds. This large difference
indicates that there is a considerable degree of genetic subdivision within breeds. In India goats are exploited very
little by artificial selection, but mtDNA analysis has established new lineages in Indian goats as compared to other
goat breeds of the world [12].
As no systematic effort has been made to create distinct
goat breeds in India, founder effects and genetic drift may
have played major role in differentiation of Indian goat
breeds. Population subdivision in Indian goats is also
supported by the average proportion of genetic differentiation among breeds (8.03%). As RST values shows the frac-

tion of total variance of allele size between populations,
the estimated RST was more than twice the size of GST and
FST, suggesting that goat breeds differ in both allele frequency and allele size. In addition, AMOVA indicated that
6.59% of the total genetic variation is between breeds of
goats, confirming higher within population diversity in
the Indian subcontinent. Mitochondrial DNA analysis in
Indian goats showed 83% of variation within breeds and
17% among breeds [12]. The between breed variation in
Swiss goats was 17% [8] using microsatellites. Similarly
mtDNA analysis showed about 10.7% variation among
the goat breeds from Africa, Middle East, Asia and Europe
[16].
Genetic relationship between Indian goat breeds
Takezaki and Nei, 1996 [14] have shown that the construction of a phylogenetic tree depends on the type of
population and number of markers used to analyse the
population. It has been also showed that increasing the
number of loci does not necessarily enhance the reliability
of the phylogeny [6]. Takezaki and Nei, 1996 [14] have
demonstrated that DA and DC are the most efficient means

of obtaining a correct tree topology on the basis of microsatellite analysis when within population variation is high
and distances between each pair of populations are used
to build a NJ tree.
The genetic data revealed that the smallest distance is
between Marwari and Sirohi and the largest distances are
between Pashmina and Black Bengal, Barbari and Black
Bengal, and Barbari and Jakhrana. The highest geographical distance between Black Bengal and Pashmina corresponds to the highest genetic distance. The phylogenetic
analysis indicated that breeds were grouped according to
their geographic locations except Barbari goats. A similar
observation of population clustering according to their
geographic origin has been reported in cattle [4]. This
shows that geographically adjacent populations are more
genetically related. The principal component analysis supported the grouping of animals and the distance between
breeds was significant. However Barbari goats showed a
deviation as they did not cluster with geographically close
breeds such as Sirohi, Jamunapari and Jakhrana. The Barbari did not group with any one of the neighboring
breeds, consistent with variation in morphological char-

acteristic (ear pattern) and presence of two new lineages
by mtDNA analysis. Moreover Jamunapari, Jakhrana and
Black Bengal clustered in one group, indicating a shared
gene pool, motivating further analysis to establish their
migration and origin through a coastal route.
Breeds cluster according to their geographic location. Similar population clustering according to geographic location was previously observed in microsatellite analyses of
humans [17], cattle [4] and chickens [18]. Mitochondrial
DNA analysis in goats also indicated geographical clustering in the breeds [12]. The result indicated that geographically adjacent populations were more genetically related,
perhaps due to founder effects and interbreeding near
bordering areas. PCA revealed separation of breeds more
clearly between populations of different geographical
locations. Some breeds which showed a close phylogenetic relationship are separated more clearly by the PCA
plot. Mt-DNA markers are extremely informative for predicting the conformation of the gene pool from maternal
inheritance. The Jamunapari is a breed of semi arid
regions and isolated in small pocket of Chambal ravines
[2]. The Barbari is a goat breed of semi arid regions and

distributed over a wide breeding tract. Pashmina goats are
found in high altitude Himalayan regions and known for
fibre quality. Similarly the Black Bengal is the most prolific breed from the eastern part of India and distributed
over a wide area. The Jakhrana is also from semiarid
regions of Rajasthan and adapted to a specific locality. The
Marwari and Sirohi are breeds of arid regions of western
India and distributed over a large breeding tract. The differential existence of breeds varying from hot humid to
hot arid, hot humid to cold humid and isolated to particular regions is illustrated by breeds such as the Jamunapari and Jakhrana. PCA isolated the Barbari from other
breeds indicating their differential origin, consistent with
ear characteristics and existence of two new lineages by
mtDNA analysis. Principal component analysis showed
clustering of goats according to their geographical origin.
Although the breeding tracts of goats are overlapping and
no strict breeding policy is adopted to maintain standard
breeds in the region, they still maintain genetic distinctness in their natural habitat. Therefore it is necessary to
combine genetic data with geographical positioning and
to assess the genetic relationship by geostatistical models
in further studies.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this analysis showed that microsatellites as
well as mtDNA analysis can be used to classify Indian goat
populations into distinct genetic groups or breeds. Phylogenetic and principal component analysis showed the
clustering of goats according to their geographical origin.
Although the breeding tracts of goats are overlapping and
they are spread over all the parts of the country, they still
maintain genetic distinctness in their natural habitat.

Methods
Genetic Stocks
A total of 302 goats representing 7 major breeds of India
were sampled from their natural habitat. The breeds studied have been grouped into 5 different types based on
their utility and size (Table 1). Summaries of goat breeds
sampled from their natural habitat are described in Table
1.
Sample collections and DNA isolation
About 10 ml of blood samples were collected from each
animal's jugular vein using EDTA vacutainers and stored
at 4°C until DNA isolation. An effort was made to collect
samples from unrelated individuals based on information
provided by farmers. The geographical distribution of the
breeds from different regions sampled for the study is
described in Table 1. DNA was isolated from blood as
described elsewhere [19].

Selection of STR markers
The markers were chosen from the existing bovine, ovine
and caprine genetic maps [20-22] with an effort to cover
all chromosomes having high heterozygosity. Twentythree STR markers were included in this study for analyzing the variation among various goat breeds (Table 2). All
the DNA samples were analysed with 23 STR markers.
Each 10μl PCR reaction mixture consists of 10 ng of template DNA, 1× buffer, 200 μM dNTPs, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 U
of AmpliTaq Gold (Perkin Elmer) and 10 pM of each
primer. Amplification conditions for these markers were
as follows: Initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 min. followed by 95°C for 1 min, specific annealing temperature
for each marker as given in Table 2 and 30 s at 72°C for
30 cycles. An final extension temperature of 72°C for 5
min was used for each reaction.
GeneScan and genotyping
One micro liter of PCR amplicons and 0.5 μl of size standard (GS-ROX500) were mixed with 2.5 μl of loading dye
(formamide: bluedextrin; 5:1), denatured (94°C for 2
mins) and electrophoresed in 5% Long Ranger (FMC) gel,
using ABI 377 automated DNA sequencer (Perkin Elmer).
GeneScan (Perkin-Elmer) software was used to analyse
the gel image and Genotyping software (Perkin-Elmer)
was used to get the allele size of each amplicons.
Statistical analysis
Exact tests for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were performed by the GENEPOP Package
[23]. The program performs a probability test using a
Markov Chain (dememorization 10,000, batches 100,
iteration per batch 1000). Genetic disequilibrium was
estimated between all locus pair using GENEPOP. The
mean number of alleles per locus (NA), total number of
alleles (TNA), the observed heterozygosity (Ho) and the
expected heterozygosity (He) under HWE were computed
using FSTAT [24] and AGArst software [25]. To test sample
bias, Allelic richness based on minimum sample size (n =
31) was estimated using FSTAT [24]. Significance levels of
difference in NA and He between populations were tested
using a Wilcoxon's signed ranks test.

Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), Fst and pairwise difference were computed using ARLEQUIN ver 3.11
[26,27]. A second estimator of gene differentiation, RST,
was calculated which accounts for variance in allele size
and was defined for genetic markers undergoing a stepwise mutation model. The DA genetic distance [28] was
computed with DISPAN [29] to establish genetic distance
between populations. A NJ/UPGMA tree was constructed
in comparison for Indian goat breeds using the PHYLIP
Package Ver3.6 [30]. The significance of population difference was tested using the exact test of population differen-

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
As admixture in the breeding tract of goats is very common and some populations are known to be admixed, we
used a multivariate procedure to represent population
relationships. Multivariate procedures are recommended
in this situation because the admixed populations are not
original evolutionary units and may be misrepresented by
phylogeny-based tree-building techniques [31]. Prior to
multivariate analysis, we tested for congruence of loci following the two-step procedure developed by MoazamiGoudarzi and Laloe, 2002 [5]. This is because a consensus
representation of population relationships is not meaningful if single markers are not congruent, as would occur
if many of the distances among populations based on
individual loci were negatively correlated [4]. Euclidean
distance matrices between all populations were first generated for each locus. Then, a Kruskall-Wallis test [32] on
rank scores of standardized distances between populations was carried out and a significant Kruskal-Wallis test
indicated that a compromise structure exists because distances are unequal between populations. If a compromise
structure exists, then a multivariate analysis, such as principal components analysis will be meaningful. PCA was
then done using the allelic frequencies as variables. It
leads to a representation of populations as a cloud of
points in a metric space. Comparison between the inertia
of single-marker enables to compare the typological value
of the markers. Inertia can be split up according to axes
and/or loci [33]. All computations were done using the R
software [34]. More specifically, computations relative to
PCA were done with the ade4 package [35].
