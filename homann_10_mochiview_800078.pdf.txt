MochiView: versatile software for genome
browsing and DNA motif analysis
Software

Oliver R Homann*1 and Alexander D Johnson1,2

Abstract
Background: As high-throughput technologies rapidly generate genome-scale data, it becomes increasingly
important to visually integrate these data so that specific hypotheses can be formulated and tested.
Results: We present MochiView, a platform-independent Java software that integrates browsing of genomic
sequences, features, and data with DNA motif visualization and analysis in a visually-appealing and user-friendly
application.
Conclusions: While highly versatile, the software is particularly useful for organizing, exploring, and analyzing large
genomic data sets, such as those from deep RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments (ChIP-Seq
and ChIP-Chip), and transcriptional profiling. MochiView provides an extensive suite of utilities to identify and to
explore connections between these data sets and short sequence motifs present in DNA or RNA.
Background
We describe a versatile tool for visualizing and exploring
large genomic data sets, particularly those generated by
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). This technique
is often used to identify regions of a genome that are
bound by a specific transcription factor under a given set
of conditions. For those transcription factors that recognize DNA directly, it is often possible, from ChIP data
alone, to deduce the range of DNA sequences (the motif )
that a given transcription factor recognizes. ChIP relies
on cross-linking transcription factors to DNA in living
cells, shearing and isolating the DNA, and recovering the
DNA cross-linked to a specific transcription factor. The
recovered DNA is then analyzed using either tiling
microarrays (ChIP-Chip) or sequencing (ChIP-Seq). Both
approaches generate a nearly continuous profile of binding enrichment across the genome, with high-density tiling for ChIP-Chip currently being feasible only for
smaller genomes, such as those from bacteria or fungi.
Several existing genome browsers aid in the visualization
and analysis of such data, but few contain tools to easily
integrate motif data into the analysis. MochiView (Motif
and ChIP Viewer) is designed to bridge this gap, provid* Correspondence: oliver.homann@ucsf.edu

ing a highly flexible and intuitive interface that allows one
to easily import, visualize, explore, and analyze large sets
of data, such as those generated from ChIP experiments.

Implementation
MochiView is written in Java, and can be used with any
operating system that supports Java version 1.6 or higher.
To facilitate smooth genome browsing (by caching data)
and the import of large files, MochiView requires hardware with a minimum of 1 GB memory. Many genome
browsers introduce an extra layer of complexity by
requiring the user to install an external database or to
store data on a remotely hosted server. MochiView circumvents this problem by transparently incorporating
the Java DB database within the software (specific features of the MochiView software design are described in
the MochiView manual). The database architecture is
designed to scale well even with very large quantities of
data; database size is primarily constrained by available
hard drive space. In practice, database sizes can range
from a few megabytes to many gigabytes in size, depending on genome size and the quantity of data. MochiView
can maintain multiple databases, and contains a database
import/export utility to facilitate sharing of compressed
databases (and plot configurations) between users. Any
database can be populated by the user with one or more
genomes by importing the genome sequence as one or

more FASTA-format files. Additional genome coordinate-based data can then be uploaded in the commonly
used GFF, BED, or WIG formats or using MochiView's
own custom file formats. Tips for setting up a database
are provided on the MochiView website.

Results and discussion
MochiView serves as both a motif analysis platform and a
feature-rich genome browser, and integrates these features to allow the visualization of motifs across a genome
plot and the refinement of motif analyses using data
imported by the user into the MochiView database (for
example, genome alignments, ChIP data, or expression
data). While many of the tools provided in MochiView
were designed with ChIP-Seq and ChIP-Chip data visualization in mind, the open and flexible data format allows
the import and visualization of any data that have a
genomic context (for example, high-throughput RNA
sequencing data). MochiView is user-friendly, and is
accessible to scientists with no programming knowledge.
MochiView's many features are extensively documented
with a tutorial walkthrough, a detailed manual, and
extensive popup text support within the software. While
many of MochiView's individual features are available in
existing software, no existing software package, to our
knowledge, integrates such a large assortment of motif
and data analysis utilities together with a highly configurable genome browser in a single desktop application.
The most similar existing package, CisGenome [1], provides a greater emphasis on processing of raw ChIP-Chip
and ChIP-Seq data and peak-finding, but is limited with
respect to the scope and ease of use of the motif and data
visualization and analysis options.
Visualizing data across the genome

MochiView uses an integrated local database to manage
all of the data imported by the user, such as genome
sequences and alignments, gene locations, microarray
probe locations, expression data, ChIP data, and motif
libraries. As shown in Figure 1, MochiView allows many
types of data to be displayed along the genome (the x-axis
of the plot) in easily customized plots. Open plot tabs
persist when the software is closed and reopened, and the
display settings can be saved for later use. While the core
design of MochiView's plots was inspired by the UCSC
Genome Browser project [2], MochiView places an added
emphasis on aesthetics, data browsing, and plot interactivity, and provides a rich interface for configuring plot
layout.
Landmarks across a genome (such as the locations of
microarray probes) are displayed by region markers (Figure 1D). Overlapping markers can be displayed as stack
tracks with one region marker positioned above the other.
Numerical data, such as ChIP-Chip enrichment levels,

Page 2 of 8

can be displayed in MochiView using line or bar plots.
These data sets can be plotted on a common y-axis (Figure 1A) or each set can be plotted on its own y-axis (Figure 1C, E, H). Alternatively, numerical data can be
displayed as text on a region marker (Figure 1D), and the
marker can be colored according to the value (a useful
means, for example, of visualizing expression data on
genes; see Figure 1B). Sequences matching DNA motifs
are identified using a user-defined scoring threshold and
are displayed in additional tracks (Figure 1F). Multiple
genome alignments, either genomes from closely related
species or from individuals of the same species, can also
be displayed (Figure 1G), providing the means to quickly
visualize whether a motif match is conserved across
closely related genomes (phylogenetic footprinting; see
Cliften et al. [3] and Kellis et al. [4]), or whether it varies
in interesting ways.
Tools for browsing and interacting with data in a plot

MochiView provides tools for browsing the genome by
sequence or by data set. The sequence browser can be
used to search and highlight specific DNA sequences,
degenerate DNA sequences (using symbols established
by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry), and direct or inverted repeats, with or without gaps.
The data browser (Figure 1I) allows the user to sort and
search any data set and rapidly jump from location to
location across the genome using hotkeys. For example,
this feature allows the user to quickly browse among
regions of ChIP enrichment above a user-specified
threshold value to rapidly visualize the most significant
binding regions. These can then be searched for matches
to a particular DNA motif.
MochiView plots are interactive and allow smooth panning along chromosomes and smooth zooming in and
out. As one continues to zoom in, the DNA sequence
itself eventually becomes visible. Virtually every element
in a plot provides descriptive popup text, and annotation
can be added to locations within tracks. In addition,
clicking on any item in a plot copies the sequence to the
clipboard, a useful tool for quickly capturing sequences
for use in another application. To aid the user in filtering
large sets of data, an Edit Mode track can be created and
used to toggle a region marker between three states (true/
false/undecided). For example, this feature is useful for
flagging and ignoring likely false positives in a set of ChIP
binding data.
MochiView's motif and multiple genome alignment
tracks (Figures 1F and 1G, respectively) are also interactive. Motif tracks show either the match scores of motif
instances (distant zoom) or the motif logo itself (close
zoom; top of Figure 1J). Double-clicking the motif
instance opens a window juxtaposing the motif logo with
the actual genome sequence. Multiple genome align-

ChIP analysis highlights many of MochiView's utilities

MochiView can serve as a central hub for data storage
and visualization, from which data can easily be imported
and exported for manipulation with other applications. In

addition, MochiView contains a number of specific tools
designed to analyze genomic and motif data. While a
description of all of the utilities provided in MochiView is
beyond the scope of this article, we discuss a few of them
in the context of analyzing ChIP data for proteins that
recognize specific DNA sequences. We focus on two
stages of analysis: (1) visualization of the primary ChIP
data and assessment/refinement of the binding region
calls, and (2) identification and characterization of regulatory motifs found within the refined binding regions.
We define a binding region as a set of genomic coordi-

Homann and Johnson BMC Biology 2010, 8:49

nates that identify the boundaries of a region of ChIP
DNA enrichment, typically associated with some measure of confidence, such as a P-value. Obviously, proper
control experiments are crucial to evaluate the biological
relevance of a binding region, a topic discussed in more
detail below.
Visualizing and refining ChIP data in MochiView

The first step of ChIP data analysis in MochiView is typically the import of raw data (ChIP-Chip enrichment or
ChIP-Seq reads) as well as the binding region calls (peak
calls). MochiView does not supply a comprehensive binding region assignment algorithm (a more limited peak
extraction/refinement utility is provided), as approaches
to calling binding regions are constantly being refined;
moreover, the approaches for calling peaks vary with the
platform used to analyze the precipitated DNA. For
example, Agilent supplies peak-calling software optimized for its array design. It is, however, straightforward
to import peak-calling results from existing software
using MochiView's import utilities, which support several
different file formats. For small genomes, it is also possible to hand-curate ChIP data in MochiView, bypassing
the peak-calling programs entirely.
Once the relevant raw data (ChIP-Chip enrichment or
ChIP-Seq reads) and binding region calls are imported,
MochiView can be used to visualize them in the context
of other genomic information. For example, ChIP data
can be viewed in a plot in conjunction with control ChIP
experiments, gene expression data, sequence GC-enrichment, histone modifications, and motifs. The snapshot
utility allows the user to create individual images (or a
single pdf ) of the plot centered at every binding region in
the data set. This feature is particularly useful for records
in laboratory notebooks or figures for manuscripts.
For those data sets with a manageable number of binding regions, it is possible to visually inspect each binding
region and eliminate clear false positives (and re-evaluate
possible false negatives) that result from the limitations of
binding site detection algorithms. Since MochiView can
display multiple data sets on the same y-axis, the user can
easily overlay multiple replicates of experimental ChIP
data as well as control data sets (for example, ChIP in a
deletion or RNAi-depleted strain or in a strain lacking the
epitope tag targeted for immunoprecipitation). These
data can then be quickly surveyed using the data browser
and an Edit Mode track, and binding regions considered
spurious (for example, those also observed in control
experiments) or unreliable (for example, those observed
in only one experimental replicate) can be flagged and
then filtered using one of MochiView's data refinement
utilities.
MochiView provides numerous additional utilities for
the analysis and manipulation of sets of locations. Set

operation utilities can take the union, intersection, or
subtraction of two location sets, thus providing a simple
mechanism for manipulating positional data. For example, the user can merge the binding region calls of experimental replicates, take the intersection of binding regions
with promoter regions, take the intersection of sets of
ChIP experiments performed with different transcription
factors, or easily eliminate binding region calls that overlap with regions found in a control experiment. Another
utility assigns binding regions to one or more genes
(based on user-defined criteria), and another surveys
whether these genes are enriched for Gene Ontology
(GO) terms (using an approach based on the software
GO TermFinder [5]). Thus, within minutes of importing
ChIP data into MochiView, a user can obtain an overview
of the cellular processes and genes predicted to be regulated by the transcription factor of interest. An important
goal of many ChIP-Chip and ChIP-Seq experiments is the
identification of the DNA motif recognized by the transcription factor of interest, and, as described next,
MochiView provides numerous tools for the discovery,
validation, and comparison of motifs.
Identifying and analyzing motifs in MochiView

We use the term motif to mean a set of short DNA
sequences represented by a position-specific weight
matrix, and define a motif match as a particular DNA
sequence in a genome that is statistically similar to a
motif. Several options are provided for scoring a DNA
sequence for matches to a motif, including logarithm of
odds (LOD) scores (reviewed in [6]), affinity scores (for
affinity motifs generated by MatrixREDUCE [7]), and Pvalues derived from LOD scores (using the compound
importance sampling algorithm of Barash et al. [8]). In
addition to finding particular matches to a motif within a
sequence, MochiView can also generate a cumulative
motif enrichment score for a full sequence using either a
simple cumulative LOD score or a Hidden Markov Model
approach (w-score, as described by Sinha et al. [9]). Figure 2 provides an overview of the many utilities provided
in MochiView for the visualization, management, and
analysis of motifs. (These tools are not specifically tied to
ChIP-Chip and ChIP-Seq analysis; they can be used in
any context.) Motifs in MochiView are visualized as
logos, using a format based on the sequence logo design
originally described by Schneider and Stephens [10]. The
MochiView database provides a convenient means to
maintain and annotate a library of motifs (Figure 2A), and
these motifs can easily be exported as frequency matrices
or logos (Figure 2B). Several motif libraries, derived from
a broad range of organisms including yeast [11-19], nematode [20], human [18,19,21,22], and mouse [18,19,2326], are provided at the MochiView website in a format
this is simple to import into MochiView. This collection

by a 25 bp gap). (g) Several utilities are provided for scoring motifs against user-defined regions. For example, it is relatively simple to output a file
containing the top motif score upstream of each gene for every motif in the library. (h) Enrichment for Gene Ontology terms can be determined for
genes with upstream sequence that contains a strong instance of a motif.

includes one of the largest curated motif libraries, over
1,300 motifs, provided courtesy of the JASPAR database
[18,19]. Additional motifs devised by the user are also
easy to import into MochiView.
MochiView provides a motif detection utility (Figure
2C) that can identify motifs de novo using a Gibbs sampling technique (based on algorithms described by Thijs
et al. [27] and the BioJava [28] online cookbook; implementation details are provided in the manual). The user
can limit a search to specific locations (for example, binding region calls from a ChIP experiment) or search the
upstream regions of a list of specific genes. It is also possible to specify that a motif occurrence must be conserved across closely related genomes. The features of
MochiView also allow the user to rapidly conduct motif
searches based on more complex queries. For example,
the user could chain together utilities to search for motifs
in the portions of binding regions that (1) overlap with
intergenic regions, (2) are within 200 bp of a peak of ChIP
enrichment, (3) do not overlap with areas of enrichment
in the control experiment, and (4) neighbor a gene that
changes expression when the transcription factor of
interest is deleted (or reduced in expression by RNAi) or
overexpressed. As an alternative to the built-in motif
detection utility, the user can also export a set of
sequences of interest (for example, those that lie within
200 bp of a peak of ChIP enrichment), apply a different
motif-finding algorithm, and import the results back into
MochiView. MochiView supports multiple motif file formats, including the output of the commonly used motif
detection applications MEME [29] and Bioprospector
[30].
Often, the first step in the analysis of a newly discovered motif is a determination of whether the motif resembles any known motifs. Motif libraries, such as those
provided at the MochiView website, can be compared
against newly discovered motifs using the motif comparison utility (Figure 2D), which generates a similarity metric based on the algorithm used by the software TomTom
[31]. This utility allows rapid determination of whether a
discovered motif is novel, previously identified, or closely
related to a motif of a different species.
Another common query in motif analysis is the extent
to which a motif is enriched in the DNA precipitated in a
given ChIP experiment (or set of experiments). In other
words, how well can the motif predict the ChIP data? The
motif enrichment utilities (Figure 2E) allow rapid assessment of motif enrichment at incremental score cutoffs for
sets of locations such as binding regions or intergenic
regions. To assess their significance, the levels of enrichment can be compared to those of a set of control locations (for example, comparison of upstream regions that
include ChIP peaks versus those that do not). This analysis can also be conducted on every motif in the library,

Page 6 of 8

allowing the user to identify all known motifs that are
enriched in the locations of interest.
Motif analysis often identifies several candidate DNA
motifs that may be recognized by the transcription factor
of interest. In the simplest cases, where the transcription
factor directly recognizes a motif, the motif is predicted
to lie under the center of the peak of ChIP enrichment. In
other cases, a motif may be significantly enriched in a set
of binding regions, not because it is recognized by the
transcription factor of interest, but rather because it is
bound by a different protein that regulates a similar set of
genes. These alternatives can be tested using MochiView's motif distribution utilities (Figure 2F), which test for
non-random positional distribution using a statistical test
for non-uniform distribution described by Casimiro et al.
[32]. These utilities can also identify non-random spacing
between genomic matches to DNA motifs (for example,
two DNA motifs, either the same or different, with
matches that are typically separated by a 30 to 50 bp gap).
Once a compelling motif has been identified from a set
of ChIP data, the motif can be explored using the
MochiView motif scoring utilities (Figure 2G) and the
plot browser to identify instances of a motif that occur in
intergenic regions but not within the binding regions
called by the ChIP-analysis algorithm. Such analysis can
reveal whether the motif is necessary and sufficient to
describe the binding of the transcription factor of interest. For example, such analysis may identify a set of genes
that is likely to be controlled by the transcription factor
but is not bound by the protein under the conditions or in
the cell types used for the ChIP analysis.
We described above how MochiView's GO term
enrichment utility could connect ChIP data to specific
cellular processes. This same strategy can be used to
search the upstream regions of genes for strong matches
to a motif and associate that motif with one or more GO
terms (Figure 2H). This approach can provide insight into
the biological role of the transcription factor and further
validate the motif's biological relevance.

Conclusions
In summary, MochiView was developed to solve problems we encountered in our basic research efforts, allowing us to integrate different types of genomic data and
analyses in a single format where biological correlations
and insights popped out from the screen. We believe the
software will be useful to members of many other basic
research laboratories who have encountered similar challenges when interpreting and analyzing data on a
genomic scale.
