Abstract
Background: Distinguishing the recent introduction of quinolone resistant gonococci into a
population from diversification of resistant strains already in the population is important for
planning effective infection control strategies. We applied molecular evolutionary analyses to DNA
sequences from 9 housekeeping genes and gyrA, parC and porB of 24 quinolone resistant N.
gonorrhoeae (QRNG) and 24 quinolone sensitive isolates collected in Israel during 2000–2001.
Results: Phylogenetic and eBURST analyses and estimates of divergence time indicated QRNG
were introduced on 3 separate occasions and underwent limited diversification by mutation,
deletion and horizontal gene transfer. Reconstruction of N. gonorrhoeae demography showed a
slowly declining effective strain population size from 1976 to 1993, rapid decline between 1994 and
1999, and an increase from 1999 to 2001. This is partially attributable to declining gonorrhea case
rates from 1973 to 1994. Additional contributing factors are selective sweeps of antibiotic resistant
gonococci and increased transmission from sex workers. The abrupt decline in the mid-1990s
heralded an increased incidence of gonorrhea from 1997 to the present. The subsequent increase
in effective strain population size since 1999 reflects the increased gonococcal census population
and introduction of quinolone resistance strains.
Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the effective use of population genetic approaches to assess
recent and historical population dynamics of N. gonorrhoeae.

Background
Resistance to fluoroquinolone antibiotics among Neiserria
gonorrhoeae strains emerged rapidly in Asia after their

introduction in 1989. Recent reports from developed
countries have documented clonal spread of quinolone
resistant N. gonorrhoeae (QRNG) [1-4]. Understanding the

origin of an epidemic and dynamics of its subsequent
spread are critical in developing effective control strategies. We recently described a high rate of QRNG in Tel
Aviv, Israel during 2000–2001 [5]. Genetic analysis of
porB using molecular probes identified two predominant
genotypes among QRNG [6] and pulse field gel electrophoresis demonstrated limited heterogeneity of the resistant strains and clear similarities to resistant strains from
southern Israel [7]. These studies suggested recent introduction of QRNG, perhaps from a single source, followed
by rapid dissemination through the country. However,
not all isolates had the identical genotype raising the
question of whether there was diversification of the original strain or whether there were multiple introductions of
QRNG strains.
Determining genetic relatedness of isolates can provide
insights into the source and pattern of spread of N. gonorrhoeae within a community. Previous studies have characterized QRNG by auxotyping/serotyping [3,8], pulse field
gel electrophoresis [3,7,9], porB gene typing with molecular probes [6], opa typing [10,11] or multiantigen
sequence typing [4,12]. For our study, we used a MultiLocus Sequence Typing (MLST) method [13,14]. MLST is a
technique for characterizing bacterial species using
sequences of internal fragments of multiple housekeeping
genes [15]. The advantage of MLST for population genetic
analysis is that housekeeping genes are presumed neutral
evolving genetic markers. Additional insights into evolutionary forces structuring bacterial populations can be
obtained from examination of loci subject to selection.
Therefore, we also sequenced a partial fragment of porB
[16], which is under strong positive selection, and segments of gyrA and parC, which are target loci for fluoroquinolone resistance [17,18]. Based on these analyses we
inferred the evolutionary history of isolates from phylogenetic, network and eBURST reconstructions and calculated time of divergence from the most recent common
ancestor in order to determine if genetically variant strains
diverged before or after the putative time QRNG first
appeared in Israel. We also estimated selective pressure on
each gene and examined the association of selected sites
with the ciprofloxacin resistance phenotype. Finally, using
a novel analytical approach from population genetics, we
estimated the past population dynamics of N. gonorrhoeae
in Israel.

Results
An increase in the incidence of gonorrhea was observed in
Israel in 1998, accompanied by the appearance of quinolone resistant N. gonorrhoeae (QRNG) isolates [5]. The
incidence of gonorrhea peaked in 2002 and declined
sharply thereafter. The rate of isolation of QRNG strains
also declined after 2001. During the epidemic period,
QRNG strains were detected in several parts of Israel.

Pulse field gel electrophoresis analysis of isolates from the
Negev region in southern Israel, Jerusalem, Haifa, and Tel
Aviv showed that all the QRNG strains were closely
related [7]. In the Tel Aviv area, there were 200 cases of
gonorrhea in 2000 and 325 cases in 2001. The isolates for
the present study were obtained from January 2000
through October 2001 in Tel Aviv, Israel [5]. Of 80 isolates collected during this time period that were previously genotyped by molecular probes for the variable
regions of the porB gene [6], we selected 24 fluoroquinolone resistant and 24 sensitive strains for more detailed
genotyping by sequencing of fragments of multiple
housekeeping genes.
Phylogenetic relationships among the ciprofloxacin sensitive and resistant strains based on 9 housekeeping genes
were estimated using the statistical parsimony procedure
and graphically depicted as a network of gene genealogies
(Figure 1). The lines on the network indicate mutational
connections among the unique genotypes with the
number of substitutions separating these sequences in
parentheses adjacent to the line. Genotypes were designated by strain number (CX), ciprofloxacin susceptibility
(R = resistance, S = sensitive), contact information (P =
paid commercial sex worker, F = non-paid sex worker, U =
unknown), and month and year of isolation. There was
no clustering of strains by contact information or date of
isolation. Eighteen of 24 resistant strains had the identical
sequence or genotype, represented in the genealogy by
C7.R.U.0701. C2.R.U.0701 and C74.R.U.0800 differed by
one mutational step from the most common genotype,
and C10.R.U.0701 differed by one nucleotide substitution from C2.R.U.0701. Thirteen mutational steps separated these resistant strains from the most recent common
ancestor for all the other strains in the data set.
C21.R.U.0801 and C24.R.U.1001 had identical genotypes
and were separated by 10 mutational steps from the next
most closely related strains, which were sensitive isolates.
The remaining resistant isolate, C3.R.U.0701, was distantly related to both the other resistant strains and was
separated by 4 mutational steps from the most closely
related sensitive strains. As a group, the sensitive strains
were more genetically diverse than the resistant strains
with 13 unique genotypes among 24 strains. However, 9
strains had the same genotype, which is represented in the
network by C5.S.U.0801. For the resistant strains, we calculated time of divergence from the most recent common
ancestor, and mean years and 95% highest posterior density (HPD) limits are shown in parentheses adjacent to the
line
connecting
genotypes.
C2R.U.0701
and
C74.R.U.0800 diverged from the majority resistant genotype on average in early 1998 or 1997, respectively, and
possibly as recently as mid-1999 or mid-1998, respectively. C10.R.U.0701 is also likely to have diverged from
the other resistant strains sometime in 1998 or 1999.

variants were identified; C21.R (representative of 2 resistant strains) and C59.S, and C37.S and C1.S (representative of 3 sensitive strains). In the statistical parsimony
analysis these strains were separated by 10 and 9 mutational steps, respectively. Although C3.R and C73.S were
separated by 4 mutational steps they did not form a clonal
complex by eBURST analysis. All the remaining strains
were separated by more than 10 mutational steps in the
parsimony analysis.

The network of genotypes of the fluoroquinolone resistance genes (Figure 3) showed a much lower level of
genetic diversity over all than that of the housekeeping
genes. Twenty-one of 24 resistant strains had the identical
genotype, with only those three strains that were also distantly related at the housekeeping gene loci exhibiting different quinolone resistance genotypes. Among the
quinolone sensitive strains, there were six genotypes, with
50% of strains having the identical genotype, which is represented in the network by C.5.S.U.0301.

C2.R.U.0701 differed by a 3 bp deletion and two nucleotide substitutions. The majority clade was estimated to
have diverged from the most recent common ancestor
approximately 23 years ago. C2.R.U.0701 formed a
branch sister to the majority clade with a mean divergence
time of 16 years. C3.R.U.0701 was distantly related to the
other porB sequences in the data set. Three resistant
strains, C28.R.P.1001, C35.R.P.0600 and C45.R.F.0900,
all from men who reported contact with sex workers, had
the same porB sequence as that of five sensitive strains. The
five sensitive strains shared a common housekeeping and
fluoroquinolone resistance genotype, which was also the
most prevalent genotype among the sensitive strains (represented by C5.S.U.0801 on the housekeeping and quinolone resistance gene genealogies). The three resistant

To determine whether positive selection has been a force
in the evolution of N. gonorrhoeae, positively selected sites
were identified by estimating the per site nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio and by evaluating changes
in amino acid properties (Table 1). With the exception of
glnA and serC, there were very few positively selected sites
(1–3) in the housekeeping genes and generally the same
amino acid was found with high frequency among the
resistant and sensitive strains. At five sites in glnA the
amino acid found most often in the resistant strains was a
low frequency amino acid in the sensitive strains. At
amino acid position 284 in pilA all the sensitive strains
had a threonine and 23 of 24 resistant strains had an
alanine. Two positively selected sites were identified in
gyrA (amino acid position 91 and 95) and one site in parC
(position 86). The resistant strains had mutations,
Ser91Phe and Asp95Asn in gyrA and Asp86Asn in parC,
that are consistent with quinolone resistance determining
mutations identified in other studies. Seventeen positively
selected sites were identified in porB and many sites were
polymorphic. A previous study showed that a single
amino acid mutation to Lys at residue 120 of the Por IB
protein confers full intermediate level resistance to penicillin and tetracycline and a single Asp mutation at either
position 120 or 121 (22 and 23 in our shorter sequences)
confers partial resistance [19]. By our analysis, both
amino acid residues are under strong positive selection. A
single Lys was found at position 120 in all 24 resistant
strains and 15 sensitive strains, and 2 sensitive strains had
an Asp at either position 120 or 121 (Table 2).
The historical demography of N. gonorrhoeae in Israel over
the past 24 years was estimated from the housekeeping
gene and porB sequences using a Bayesian MCMC method
that allows the inference of past population dynamics
from contemporary sequences (Figure 5). After decreasing
slowly from 1976 to approximately 1993, the effective
strain population size declined sharply from 1993 to
1999. However, since 1999, it has been flat to slightly
increasing. The census population of gonococcal infections in Israel, represented by the clinical case-incidence
rate per 100,000 persons, declined from 40 in 1970 to 4

rate rose to 3.9 and further increased to 8.3 in 2000. The
genetic data support this demographic information on the
declining infection rate since the 1970s and the recent rise
of infection rates since the late1990's

Discussion
Quinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae (QRNG) are
currently a worldwide problem. In many developed countries QRNG infections reflect a combination of importation and endemic spread. Importation can be inferred
from a medical history of having had sex partners abroad
or contact with someone who did; however, patient
reports may not be reliable, particularly if there has been
sex with anonymous partners or commercial sex workers.

Genotyping has been applied to QRNG and the detection
of clusters of identical strains is thought to reflect endemic
transmission, while detection of multiple, heterogeneous
isolates is characteristic of imported strains. However,
because gonococci undergo rapid genetic diversification
[21-23], a clonal population may not persist for long periods of time. Thus, sampling from the general population
of patients with QRNG may yield a genetically complex
sample reflecting the diverse epidemiology of QRNG
infections and the evolution of N. gonorrhoeae.
In order to distinguish between importation and diversification, we applied molecular evolutionary analyses to a
recent outbreak of QRNG in Israel. Advantages of Israel
for such studies are that the country is small, contained,

and has a good health care system, and gonorrhea is a
notifiable disease. Our phylogenetic analyses suggested
that QRNG were imported into Israel on at least three separate occasions, resulting in an isolated infection by strain
C3R, two infections by the genetically identical strains,
C21R and C24R, and 21 infections with the remaining
resistant strains. In support of importation as the source of
these infections, the housekeeping gene genealogy

showed that C3R and C21/24R were distantly related to
the other resistant strains and all the resistant strains had
diverged from the most recent common ancestor prior to
the first known appearance of QRNG in Israel. These
strains also differed at the quinolone resistance loci but an
accurate divergence time could not be calculated due to
their low genetic variation. C3R was also distantly related
to the other resistant strains at the porB locus. Since qui-

N. gonorrhoeae population dynamics in Israel over the past
quarter century. Relative genetic population size (Neτ,

nolones were introduced into clinical practice in Israel in
the mid 1990s, we cannot entirely exclude the possibility
of antibiotic selection pressure acting on indigenous
Israeli strains. Antibiotic selection pressure is unlikely to
explain the emergence of the majority resistant clone since
it was distantly related to all the sensitive Israeli strains we
sampled. However, C3R may have diverged as recently as
4.4 years earlier from C73S, placing the split close to the
mid 1990s. Our estimate of the lower limit for divergence
time between C21R/C24R and C59S is 8.8 years. In the
eBURST analysis, C21R/C24R and C59S were double
locus variants, an observation that suggests they may be
evolutionarily closely related. Additional sampling of sensitive strains from the 1990s may help resolve the uncertainty regarding the origins of the C3R and C21R/C24R
strains.
We also found evidence to support genetic diversification
within the population of resistant strains after they
entered Israel. Strains C2R, C10R and C74R were within
one mutational step of the clonal population of resistant
strains at the housekeeping gene loci and could have
diverged from a common ancestor within the time period
that resistant strains have circulated in Israel. The lower
limit for the divergence time would place these events in
1998 or 1999. The eBURST analysis grouped these strains
as a clonal complex. By definition clonal complexes are
presumed to share a recent common ancestor. Six strains
differed from the majority of resistant strains at the porB
locus by a 3–9 bp deletion. Although a divergence time
cannot be estimated for deletions, because the strains did
not accumulate any substitutions, the deletions must be
relatively recent events. C2R differed at the porB locus
from the majority of resistant strains by a deletion and
two nucleotide substitutions. Because the estimate of

divergence time suggested a split prior to the early 1990s,
we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that this strain
represents a separate importation. Three strains, C28R,
C35R and C45R, did not differ from the other resistant
strains at the 9 housekeeping and 2 quinolone resistance
gene loci but they had a variant porB sequence that was
prevalent among sensitive strains in Israel. The acquisition of a new porB sequence by these strains is likely the
result of horizontal gene transfer and may be a recent
event. Of note these subjects reported having sex with
commercial sex workers who are likely to harbor multiple
gonococcal strains, which would increase the chances for
horizontal gene transfer.
Positive selection can have a strong impact on bacterial
evolution; therefore, we analyzed the nucleotide
sequences of the resistant and sensitive strains for positively selected sites. As expected, positively selected sites
were identified in the quinolone resistance genes, gyrA
and parC, and the resistant strains had mutations that
have previously been shown to be determinants of quinolone resistance. Although the three resistance genotypes did not share a common ancestor they had common
Ser91Phe gyrA and Asp86Asn parC mutations, demonstrating convergent evolution of these drug resistant mutations. The housekeeping genes, except for glnA and serC,
had a paucity of positively selected sites consistent with
the expectation that these genes are not under strong positive selection. No mutations at positively selected sites in
the 9 housekeeping genes were significantly associated
with QRNG. In contrast, 17 positively selected sites were
identified in the porB sequence and many sites were highly
polymorphic. This is not surprising given the selection
pressure on this gene from the immune system and antibiotic treatment. Mutations to charged amino acids at two
positively selected sites, corresponding to residues at position 120 and 121 of the N. gonorrhoeae PIB porin, have
been associated with resistance to penicillin and tetracycline [19] and these mutations were found in 100% of the
QRNG strains, although they were also present in a high
proportion of the quinolone sensitive strains.
Changes in effective population size over time can provide insights into the epidemiology of gonorrhea. Effective population size is a complex evolutionary parameter
reflecting changes in the actual population size, excluding
genetically equivalent organisms, and also the influence
of environmental and host factors on the ability of individual strains to contribute to future generations. Our
analysis of population dynamics of N. gonorrhoeae over
the past quarter century in Israel revealed a slow decrease
in the effective strain population size from 1976 to 1993,
a steeper decline from 1993 to 1999 and then a rise from
1999 to the present. Since the steepest decline in the census population of gonococcal isolates occurred between

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:84

1981 and 1987 [20], it is likely to have played only a small
part in the decrease in the effective population size during
the 1990s. A potentially important factor in the decline is
the appearance in Israel, as elsewhere in the world, of penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae (PPNG) and chromosomally mediated penicillin resistance during the late
1980s and early 1990's. A selective sweep by antibiotic
resistant strains would be expected to decrease genetic
complexity of the gonococcal population and thus cause
a decrease in effective strain population size. Behavioral
changes, such as increased transmission from sex workers
(see below), could also reduce genetic diversity as a result
of common source outbreaks with genetically related
strains. The increase in the census population of gonococcal isolates in Israel since 1998 has been attributed primarily to an increase in the sex worker population, especially
of foreign workers from countries with high rates of gonorrhea [20]. If this interpretation is correct, then the
decrease in effective strain population size in the mid
1990s may have been a harbinger of the subsequent
increase in rates of gonorrhea in Israel. The rise in effective
strain population size since 1999 is consistent with the
increase in the census population and also with the recent
introduction and spread of QRNG. The imported QRNG
strains differed from prevalent quinolone sensitive strains
at many loci. Additionally, these strains appear to have
evolved rapidly through point mutation, recombination
and horizontal gene transfer. All these factors would be
expected to increase the genetic diversity of the pool of N.
gonorrhoeae strains in Israel and thus increase the effective
strain population size. A limitation of our reconstruction
of population dynamics is the small sample size (48
strains). However, we compensated for the small number
by sampling multiple loci (11 gene fragments). A limitation of the BEAST method is the assumption of no recombination. We did not detect recombination in our data set,
as indicated by RDP2 [24], and, moreover,, the correlation between the population genetic inference and the
prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae during the most recent time
period demonstrates the utility of the analytical approach,
as suggested before [25].

gonococcal surveillance data can assist in understanding
the development, impact and public health importance of
QRNG.

Methods
Description of isolate collection and sequence
determination
The isolates for the present study were obtained from January 2000 through October 2001 in Tel Aviv, Israel
[5,26]. The majority of isolates were a random sample of
male urethral isolates. Of 80 isolates collected during this
time period that were previously genotyped by molecular
probes for the variable regions of the porB gene [6], we
selected 24 fluoroquinolone resistant and 24 sensitive
strains for more detailed genotyping by sequencing of
fragments of multiple housekeeping genes. For isolates
with an identical porB genotype, only a representative
strain was typed. All patient identifiers associated with
isolates were removed prior to typing.

Genomic DNA was isolated as described previously [6].
Partial regions of the following 9 core housekeeping genes
were sequenced: abcZ, fumC, gdh, glnA, gnd, pilA, ppk, pyrD,
and serC [14]. Fragments of gyrA and parC, encompassing
the fluoroquinolone resistance-determining regions, and
a segment of porB, spanning hypervariable loops 3 to 6,
were also sequenced. PCR reactions and nucleotide
sequencing of PCR products were performed as described
previously [25].
Genetic analysis
A total of 576 DNA sequences were used for the genetic
analyses; 432 housekeeping gene sequences, 48 porB
sequences and 48 gyrA and parC gene sequences. Unique
sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession
and
numbers
[GenBank:
EF014714–EF014722
EF016649–EF016670]. Sequences were translated into
amino acids using the universal reading frame in MacClade 4.05 [27] and then aligned in ClustalX [28] using
the default options. The 9 housekeeping genes and the 2
fluoroquinolone resistance genes were separately concatenated into two sequences for each isolate.

Conclusion
We demonstrate the effective use of population genetic
approaches to assess recent and historical population
dynamics of N. gonorrhoeae. Our analysis indicates that
QRNG are likely to have entered Israel on at least three
occasions and resistant strains have evolved at multiple
loci during the 3–4 years that these strains have circulated
in the country. The emergence of these strains in Israel has
lead to an increase in genetic diversity at antigenically
important loci and an increase in the effective strain population size, as well as an increase in infection rates.
Reconstruction of evolutionary relationships and estimation of divergence time in conjunction with traditional

Evolutionary relationships among porB gene sequences
were assessed using the Bayesian approach in MrBayes
v3.0 [29]. Models of nucleotide substitution were assessed
using a maximum likelihood approach [30] with best-fit
models selected by Modeltest v3.06 [31] using Akaike
information criterion [32]. The substitution model
GTR+Γ+I was selected as the best-fit model of molecular
evolution. The porB sequences exhibited length polymorphism. We introduced that information into the Bayesian
analysis coupled with the porB sequence variation by coding each gap string as a different character. Evolutionary
relationships among resistant and susceptible housekeep-

ing and fluoroquinolone resistance gene sequences were
assessed using the method of statistical parsimony [33] as
implemented in the software package TCS v1.13 [34]. Statistical parsimony has been demonstrated to significantly
outperform traditional phylogenetic approaches when the
level of divergence among sequences is low [35], as it is for
housekeeping genes. Moreover, this method allows for
moderate levels of recombination when estimating reticulate connections among genotypes.
Recent evolutionary relationships among the housekeeping gene sequences were analyzed using the eBURST algorithm [36]. First, allele numbers were assigned to each of
the nine housekeeping loci and the allele numbers for all
nine genes of each isolate were assembled into a string of
integers giving the allele profile for each isolate. Each
unique allelic profile was assigned a sequence type (ST)
number. The STs and their allelic profiles are the input
data used by eBURST. The program groups STs into clonal
complexes. A criterion of seven shared alleles out of the 9
alleles examined was used to define a clonal complex.
Thus, within a clonal complex, the STs must share seven
or more alleles with at least one other ST of the clonal
complex. Two STs that differ at one locus are referred to as
single locus variants and those that differ at two loci as
double locus variants.
The past population dynamics of N. gonorrhoeae in Israel
was inferred using the Bayesian skyline plot model [37] as
implemented in BEAST v1.3 [38] under the GTR+Γ+I
model for both the 9 housekeeping and porB genes.
Because BEAST assumes no recombination, before performing the analysis, we tested for the presence of recombinant sequences and gene regions in all the data sets by
using RDP2 [24]. Uniform prior distributions were used
for the mean substitution rates. Lower and upper limits
and mean of these distributions were obtained from an
extensive N. gonorrhoeae data set from Baltimore recently
analyzed by our group [25]. These substitution rates were
used for estimating divergence times of the resistant Israeli
strains (see below). The Bayesian Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) output generated by BEAST was analyzed
in Tracer v1.3 [39].
Mean divergence times (and 95% posterior probability
intervals) of the most common recent ancestor of the
resistant strains were estimated on the 9 housekeeping
gene-TCS network and the porB-Bayesian tree assuming a
substitution rate distribution previously estimated under
a relaxed clock model [25]. We used the following mean
substitution rates (and 95% posterior probability intervals) measured as the number of substitutions per site
with the per gene and year rates given in parentheses: 9
housekeeping genes = 0.2723 (0.105, 0.4538) and porB =
0.128 (0.048, 0.221).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/84

We inferred the extent of natural selection by estimating
the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions, ω (= dN/dS) per site using the codon-based nested
models M7 (beta) and M8 (beta and ω) of Yang et al. [40]
as implemented in the PAML package [41]. Model likelihood scores were compared using a likelihood ratio test.
When ω is greater than 1 in M8 positively selected sites
can be inferred. We applied the empirical Bayesian
approach [42] to identify the potential sites under diversifying selection as indicated by a posterior probability (pP)
> 0.95. Additionally, we used the approach of McClellan
et al. [43] for inferring sites under positive destabilizing
selection (i.e., selection that results in radical structural or
functional shifts in local regions of the protein; comparable to adaptive selection in PAML) in terms of 31 quantitative amino acid properties. We followed the procedure
in McClellan [44] in combination with a recently
described analytical algorithm [13] implemented in TreeSAAP ver3.2 [45].
