Abstract
Background: Mitochondrial DNA-derived sequences have become popular markers for
evolutionary studies, as their comparison may yield significant insights into the evolution of both
the organisms and their genomes. From the more than 24,000 teleost species, only 254 complete
mtDNA sequences are available (GenBank status on 06 Sep 2006). In this paper, we report the
complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Asian arowana, a basal bonytongue fish species, which
belongs to the order of Osteoglossiformes.
Results: The complete mitochondrial genomic sequence (mtDNA) of Asian arowana (Scleropages
formosus) was determined by using shotgun sequencing method. The length of Asian arowana
mtDNA is ca. 16,650 bp (its variation is due to polymorphic repeats in the control region),
containing 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA and 2 rRNA genes. Twelve of the thirteen protein
coding genes were found to be encoded by the heavy strand in the order typically observed for
vertebrate mitochondrial genomes, whereas only nad6 was located on the light strand. An
interesting feature of Asian arowana mitogenome is that two different repeat arrays were identified
in the control region: a 37 bp tandem repeat at the 5' end and an AT-type dinucleotide
microsatellite at the 3' end. Both repeats show polymorphism among the six individuals tested;
moreover the former one is present in the mitochondrial genomes of several other teleost groups.
The TACAT motif described earlier only from mammals and lungfish was found in the tandem
repeat of several osteoglossid and eel species. Phylogenetic analysis of fish species representing
Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii taxa has shown that the Asian arowana is located near the baseline
of the teleost tree, confirming its status among the ancestral teleost lineages.
Conclusion: The mitogenome of Asian arowana is very similar to the typical vertebrate
mitochondrial genome in terms of gene arrangements, codon usage and base composition.
However its control region contains two different types of repeat units at both ends, an interesting
feature that to our knowledge has never been reported before for other vertebrate mitochondrial
control regions. Phylogenetic analysis using the complete mtDNA sequence of Asian arowana
confirmed that it belongs to an ancestral teleost lineage.

Background
Most animal mitochondrial genomes contain 37 genes,
including 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNAs
(rRNA) and 22 transfer RNAs (tRNA) necessary for translation of the proteins encoded by the mtDNA [1]. They
also possess a major non-coding control region that contains the initial sites for mtDNA replication and mtRNA
transcription. The mitochondrial genome generally
evolves at elevated rates (5–10 times) compared to single
copy nuclear genes, however its gene order often remains
unchanged over long periods of evolutionary time, with
some exceptions [1]. The genetic code of mitochondrial
genomes is more degenerated and thus less constrained
than the universal eukaryotic nuclear code [2]. In most
animal mitochondrial genomes the genes are distributed
on both strands, whereas in some, all genes are transcribed from one strand (e.g. Tigriopus japonicus) [3]. Mitochondrial DNA-derived markers have become popular for
evolutionary studies, as the data obtained by their analysis
may yield significant insights into the evolution of both
the organisms and their genomes [1,4].
Teleosts represent the largest vertebrate group with over
24,000 species, accounting for more than the half of all
vertebrates. The ancestors of the oldest extant teleost species found on the earth today is believed to have originated from the Mid-triassic, ca. 200 million years before
present [5]. Today's teleosts can be classified into 45
orders with a total of 435 families [6]. Over 160 complete
fish mitochondrial genomes – representing more than 25
orders – have been reported in the peer-reviewed literatures and more than 70 additional fully sequenced mitochondrial genomes can be retrieved from GenBank (status
on February 20, 2006).
The Asian arowana (dragonfish; Scleropages formosus, Osteoglossidae) belongs to the order Osteoglossiformes, one of
the ancestral teleost clades with extant representatives
restricted to freshwater habitats [6]. It is one of the most
expensive ornamental fish species in the world. The Asian
arowana is listed by the Convention on International
Trades in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora
(CITES) as a "highly endangered" species, therefore a special permit is required for farms dealing with its culture
[7]. There are three basic colour varieties of the Asian
arowana: the green, the golden and red with several distinct sub-varieties. They all seem to have originated from
different regions of Southeast Asia, which were probably
connected through freshwater habitats during the Pleistocene glacial ages (ca. 0.11–1.8 million years ago) [8].
According to currently accepted taxonomy, the Osteoglossiformes order encompasses the Osteoglossoidei and Notopteroidei suborders. The Osteoglossoidei suborder contains two
families:Osteoglossidae and Pantodontidae. The Osteoglossidae family is made up of seven species: Scleropages formosus

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/242

(range: Southeast Asia), S. jardinii (Northern Australia
and New Guinea), S. leichardti (Eastern Australia), Osteoglossum bicirrhosum (South America), O. ferreirai (South
America), Arapaima gigas (South America) and Heterotis
niloticus (West Africa and the Nile) [6]. The Pantodontidae
family contains only one species, the butterfly fish, Pantodon buchholzi (West Africa) [6]. Among these eight Osteoglossoidei species, mitochondrial genomes have been
fully sequenced only from two species: O. bicirrhosum and
P. buchholzi [9]. The sister suborder Notopteroidei has three
families with 56 species [6], however complete mtDNA
sequence is only available for a single species, the goldeneye (Hiodon alosoides, Hiodontoidae).
Although the Asian arowana is one of the most valuable
ornamental teleosts, relatively few scientific papers have
been published about the species in peer-reviewed literature. Most of these are classical studies dealing with the
taxonomy, and physiology of the species (see e.g. [1012]), only a recent papers use molecular methods (see e.g.
[13-15]). The lack of molecular and genomic information
about Asian arowana has hindered the study of its biology. Polymorphic DNA markers are expected to be highly
useful tools for the understanding of the biology of Asian
arowana.
In this paper we describe the complete mitochondrial
genome sequence of Asian arowana that has a unique
control region containing two different repeat arrays at its
ends. Phylogenetic analysis based on fully sequenced
mitogenomes of all four osteoglossid species and sixteen
other species from Euteleostomi confirmed the position of
Osteoglossoidei among basal fishes. This mitogenomic
sequence will be highly useful for the characterization of
mtDNA-based polymorphisms, which in turn will provide useful tools for the analysis of parental care of the
species.

Results and discussion
Gene content and genome organization
The complete mitochondrial genome of Asian arowana
was sequenced with shotgun sequencing method (min.
6X, average 9X coverage). Its total size was found to be ca.
16,651 bp [GenBank:DQ023143]. Except the mitochondrial control region the size of Asian arowana mitochondrial genome was found to be similar to that of silver
arowana, butterfly fish and goldeneye [9] [see Additional
file 1 for the exact sizes]. The GC content of Asian arowana
mitochondrial genome was 46.1%, the highest among
mitochondrial genomes of all Osteoglossiformes available
in Genbank (silver arowana – 43%, butterfly fish – 39%
and goldeneye – 42%).

On the whole, the structure of the Asian arowana mitochondrial genome is very similar to that of silver arowana,

butterfly fish and bichir [see Additional file 2]. The
number and order of genes in the Asian arowana mitogenome [see Additional file 3] were found to be the same as
common vertebrate form [1]. It contains 24 RNA and 13
protein-coding genes: 7 subunits of the NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (nad1-6 and nad4L), 3 subunits of the cytochrome c oxidase complex (cox1-3), a
single subunit of the ubiquinol cytochrome c oxidoreductase complex (cob), 2 subunits of ATPase (atp6 and
atp6), 2 ribosomal RNA (rrnL and rrnS) and 22 transfer
RNA (trn) genes. The non-coding control regions situated
between the trnP and trnF genes contain the heavy strand
origin of replication (OH). A smaller control region containing the putative light strand origin of replication (OL)
was found between trnW and trnY genes.
Eleven potential overlaps between genes have been
observed in the Asian arowana mitogenome. The longest
one (10 bp) involving the two ATPase genes appears to be
common in most vertebrate mitochondrial genome, and
its size in fish (7–10 bp [16]) is smaller than that in mammals (40–46 bp; [2]). The second largest overlap is 7 bp
long, (between nad4 and nad4L genes), whereas the
remaining nine were in the size range of 1–5 bp.
Mitochondrial control region
The Asian arowana mtDNA's heavy strand control region,
also known as D-loop, contains OH and is ca 980 bp long.
Similar to typical vertebrate mitogenomes, this non-coding region can be divided into three different domains
[17,18] (Figure 1A). Domain I which is 400 bp long, consists of a termination associated sequence (TAS: TACATAAATTG) [19] and several copies of a previously described
conserved palindromic motif without any known function [20]. A 37 bp tandem repeat array, suggested to be
involved in the regulation of mitochondrial genome replication by forming a thermostable "hairpin" [21], was
also found in this domain (see next section for details).
Domain II – commonly known as the central conserved
block – covering the 401–641 bp stretch in the control
region, showed high similarity to domain II of rainbow
trout [22] and sturgeon [21] (data not shown). In domain
III, a TA-dinucleotide microsatellite repeat was present in
all the six individuals from which the control region was
sequenced. Two conserved sequence blocks (CSB1; 724–
742 bp and CSB3; 813–839 bp) found in this domain
showed high similarity to CSBs detected earlier in other
species [23] whereas CSB2 described earlier in teleosts
[24] was not found.

A smaller control region (34 bp) for OL exhibited high
sequence similarity to the corresponding region in silver
arowana, bichir and butterfly fish (data not shown). The
AT content of Asian arowana OL which was 35.3%, is similar to that of butterfly fish but higher than in silver arow-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/242

ana (31.4%) and much lower than in bichir (44%). The
secondary structure of OL was suggested earlier to regulate
light strand replication [25]. In Asian arowana this secondary structure consists of a perfect 9 bp stem (CCTCCCGCC/GGAGGGCGG) and loop structure. Despite the
fact that the control region is the most variable region in
animal mtDNAs, most part of the stem (TCCCGCC and
AGGCGGA) was found to be conserved in the mitogenomic OL of several fish species (including the Asian
arowana) and even mammalian ones [26].
Repeats in the heavy strand control region
The mtDNA of all six Asian arowana individuals tested
possess a heteroplasmic tandem repeat array in domain I
(Figure 1B). The tandem repeat arrays in the six individual
fishes sequenced contained 3 to 6 repeat units, resulting
in variable length of the heavy strand control region (976
to 1094 bp long). A partial repeat unit could also be found
at the beginning and at the end of the array indicating that
it might have been formed by replication slippage [21,27].

The tandem repeat units were highly similar with only a
few base substitutions (Figure 1B). Each repeat unit in the
array was 37 bp long (TACATATTATGCATAATCATGCATATATATGTACTAG). The conserved motif TACAT (previously described only in mammals [28] and lungfish [29])
and its complement ATGTA, were both located in the stem
region providing the theoretical ability of forming a stable
hairpin loop (Figure 2A). Our investigation of the other
three members of Osteoglossiformes with fully sequenced
mitogenome (i.e. silver arowana, butterfly fish and goldeneye) has shown that this conserved motif could also be
found in a similar arrangement in their heavy strand control region (Figure 2A). Further investigation revealed that
the two motifs could also be found in the heavy strand
control region of several eel species (Anguilliformes) (Figure 2B). The conservation of this motif across various vertebrate taxa suggests that it serves an important role in the
mitochondrial heavy strand control region. An extensive
search of the literature database showed that since it was
reported more than a decade ago, no extensive study was
published to investigate its function. Based on the position of the motif, we speculate that it might be required
for the formation of a thermostable hairpin involved in
replication of the tandem repeat array. We also cannot
rule out the possibility of the motif being binding sites for
proteins involved in replication.
Another type of repeat – a TA-type dinucleotide microsatellite – was present at the opposite end of the heavy strand
control region in domain III (Figure 1B). The number of
TA core units ranged from 8 to 10 in the six individuals
sequenced. Although both tandem repeats alone (e.g [3033]) or microsatellites in the tandem repeat array [34] has
been reported earlier in the heavy strand control regions

genomes whereby post-transcriptional polyadenylation
provides the two adenosine residues required for generating the TAA stop codon [35].

Protein-coding genes
The start codon usage in the Asian arowana mitogenome
was found to be the same as that of zebrafish [16]. All but
one of the 13 protein coding genes began with the orthodox ATG start codon, only cox1 used GTG start codon [see
Additional file 2]. Ten genes ended in a complete termination codon, either TAA, TAG or AGA. The remaining three
genes (cox2, nad4 and cob) did not possess a complete stop
codon, but did show a terminal T. This condition is
known to be common to vertebrate mitochondrial

The total nucleotide length for the 13 coding genes was
found to be 11,403 bp, shorter than that of silver arowana
and butterfly fish, but longer than that of bichir [see Additional file 2 for the exact sizes]. The coding sequences in
Asian arowana consisted of 28.0% A, 25.1% T, 14.8% G
and 32.1% C bases. The corresponding ranges for silver
arowana, butterfly fish and bichir were 29.2–30.4% (A),
27.9–31.3% (T), 13.4–14.2% (G), and 24.3–28.8% (C).
These data further support the observations: i) the GC
content of Asian arowana mitogenome is higher than that

of other teleost, including other known Osteoglossoidei
species; and ii) the frequency of G is the lowest among the
four bases in fish mitochondrial genomes [2].
Comparison of amino acid sequences for the 13 proteins
among Asian arowana, silver arowana, butterfly fish and
bichir confirmed the closer taxonomic relatedness of
Asian arowana to silver arowana, than to butterfly fish or
bichir (Table 1). In agreement with others' data [2,36],
cox1 was the most conserved gene and atp8 was the most
variable.
The pattern of codon usage in Asian arowana mtDNA was
also studied. The most frequently used amino acids were
leucine (16.9%), followed by threonine (8.9%), alanine
(8.4%) and glycine (7.8%) [see Additional file 4]. At the
third codon position, the order of nucleotide usage frequency was C > A > T > G (Figure 3), the same order was
described earlier for the mitochondrial genome of Japanese fugu [37]. The order was somewhat different in the
silver arowana, butterfly fish and bichir, where A became
the most frequently used base in the third codon position,
albeit the frequency of G remained the lowest (Figure 3).
For amino acids with fourfold degenerate third codon
position, codons ending with A were the most frequent
(42.7%), followed by C (36.5%), T (14.1%) and G
(6.2%). Genes located on the heavy strand showed a typical native GC and positive AT skew (Figure 4), whereas
the nad6 gene located on the light strand displayed an
opposite pattern. With regard to the absolute value, the
GC skew was always higher than the AT skew: the former
ranged from 0.60 to 1, whereas the latter ranged from 0.33
to 0.72 (Figure 4). Similar patterns were also seen in silver
arowana, butterfly fish and bichir (data not shown). The

Transfer RNA genes
The twenty-two tRNA genes typical of vertebrate mitochondrial genomes have all been detected in the Asian
arowana mitogenome. All tRNA genes possessed anticodons that match the vertebrate mitochondrial genetic
code. The length of tRNA genes ranged from 67 bp to 74
bp [see Additional file 3] with a total length of 1,550 bp,
similar to silver arowana and bichir, but shorter than that
in butterfly fish [see Additional file 2]. The inferred secondary structure of the 22 tRNA genes had several uniform features: 7 bp in the aminoacyl stem, 5 bp in the TφC
and anticodon stem, 4 bp in the DHU stem and 7 bp in
the anticodon loop. A "U" residue before the anticodon
was found in 19 of the 22 tRNA, whereas a purine was
detected in the position immediately 3' to the anticodon.
In the stem regions, there were several non-complementary pairings, mainly A-C type. A similar structure has
been found in the silver arowana, whereas different kinds
of non-standard base pairings have also been described in
other fish species [2]. The original sequences and the secondary structure of the tRNA genes were quite different in
genetically distant related species.
Ribosomal RNA genes
Like the mitochondrial genome of other fishes, the Asian
arowana mitogenome was found to possess two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, a small rRNA gene (rrnS) and a
large rRNA gene (rrnL), the two being separated by trnV
[see Additional file 3]. The length of rrnS and rrnL are 956
and 1,698 bp, respectively [see Additional file 3]. These
sizes are similar to those in the other three species used for
comparison [see Additional file 2]. Substitution rates of

the two rRNAs among Asian arowana, butterfly fish and
bichir were lower than those of protein coding genes. Secondary structures found in the four species seemed to be
conserved across large evolutionary distances, as
described earlier for teleosts [2].
Phylogenetic analysis of the Osteoglossomorpha
superorder
Several studies have been published recently on the phylogeny of Osteoglossoidei suborder using morphological
data [11], partial mitochondrial sequences [38], a few
nuclear genes [39] or the combination of the latter two
[40]. On the other hand, there is only a single study that
analysed the phylogenetic relationship of the osteoglossids based on all genes present in the mitochondrial
genomes [41] but the Asian arowana was not included as
its complete mitogenomic sequence was not available.

To determine whether the addition of the complete Asian
arowana mitogenome causes any difference in the evolu-

tionary position of the Osteoglossomorpha from the cladograms produced earlier [11,38-40], we used the complete
Asian arowana mitogenome sequence obtained in this
study and other osteoglossids' complete mitogenome
sequences to carry out phylogenetic analysis. Beside the
osteoglossid species our analysis also included mtDNA
from three fish species of ancestral lineages: four members
of the Chondrostei taxon and representatives for both the
Elopomorpha and Clupeocephala taxa (for complete list of
species used, refer to Additional file 1). Using both nucleotide and amino acid sequences of different kinds of
mitochondrial genes (see Materials and Methods for
details) the systematic arrangements were reconstructed
as monophyletic which is in agreement with the relationship tree of basal Actinopterygians produced by Inoue and
colleagues [41].
Phylogenetic trees constructed with the various data sets
using three different methods (i.e. MP, BI and ML)
showed little variations within the data set, indicating that

Phylogenetic analysis of osteoglossids and other teleosts by using concatenated mitochondrial protein-coding
genes. The data sets consist of a total of 3,675 amino acid positions concatenated from 12 protein sequences for each species.
The phylogenetic relationship of Asian arowana with respect to representatives from Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii taxa using
dogfish shark as outgroup was performed by maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inferences (BI)
methods. Tree topology produced by the different methods was similar. Bootstrap values are in parentheses and in MP/ML/BI
order.

variation mainly originated from the type of data and not
the methods used (data not shown). On all trees the Asian
arowana was clustered into one group with the silver
arowana, butterfly fish and goldeneye (all three from the
Osteoglossomorpha superorder) with a high bootstrap support value. However, within Teleostei taxon the position of
Osteoglossomorpha clade varied in the trees generated using
concatenated protein-coding cum tRNA nucleotide
sequences and concatenated protein-coding cum tRNA
cum rRNA nucleotide sequences data sets. On the other
hand, trees generated using concatenated protein-coding
nucleotide sequences and concatenated amino acid
sequences data sets consistently placed the Osteoglossomorpha clade at the basal level (Figure 5). This is in agreement

with trees constructed earlier by others using various
molecular [9,38-41] and morphological data [11]. In
addition the proximity of Osteoglossomorpha clade to that
of basal teleost clades in our study further supports the
position of osteoglossids among the early branches of living teleosts' stem lineages (see e.g. [41])
The placement of goldeneye and butterfly fish was different in osteoglossid cladograms produced earlier on the
basis of morphological data [41-46]. While most publications predicted that during the evolution of osteoglossids
the ancestor of goldeneye split off earlier from the arowanas, than from the butterfly fish [42-45]. One study proposed exactly the opposite [46]. Our cladogram based on

full mtDNA sequences similarly to the data from [41]
from four osteoglossids supports the former situation
(Figure 5).
Since goldeneye is the only complete mtDNA sequence
reported for Notopteroidei suborder, additional full mitogenomic sequences from this taxonomic group will have to
be obtained for a more detailed analysis.

Conclusion
Although the length, gene content and gene order of the
mitochondrial genome of Asian arowana is similar to
those of other teleost and vertebrate mitochondrial
genomes, it exhibits a number of interesting characteristics. Among them the most interesting is the presence of
two different kinds of polymorphic repeat sequences at
the opposite ends of the mitochondrial control region.
These repeats could be potentially useful for the analysis
of genetic diversity of populations, as well as phylogenetic
and phylogeographic studies of the Asian arowana and
possibly other members of Osteoglossoidae family. The
complete mitogenome of Asian arowana provides an
additional important dataset for the study of osteoglossids and other basal fish species.

Materials and methods
Sample collection and preparation
Six adult Asian arowana individuals (two green, two red
and two golden variety) were obtained from a fish farm in
Singapore. A small piece of fin clip (ca. 0.5 cm3) was collected from every individual and kept in absolute ethanol
at 4°C. Whole genomic DNA including nuclear and mitochondrial DNA was isolated using a quick method developed previously in our laboratory [47].
PCR amplifications
Two pairs of primers (Dmt-A1/B1 and Dmt-A2/B2, see
Additional file 5) were designed from nucleotide
sequences of nad2 gene [GenBank:AB035222] and cob
gene [GenBank:AB035234] deposited in Genbank. Long
distance PCRs were carried out using Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche) to amplify 2 overlapping fragments of the complete mitochondrial genome. Each 50 µl
reaction volume contained 1 × PCR buffer 2 (Roche) with
2.0 mM MgCl2, 200 nM of each primer, 400 µM dNTP, 50
ng genomic DNA of one green Asian arowana and 3 U Taq
polymerase mix (Roche). The following PCR program was
used: 10 cycles of 94°C for 10 sec, 63°C for 30 sec and
68°C for 8 min then 19 cycles of 94°C for 10 sec, 63°C
for 30 sec and 68°C for 5 min with an addition of 20 sec/
cycle, as well as a final extension at 68°C for 10 min.
Primer pair Dmt-A1B1 amplified a fragment of ca. 7.3 kb
and primer pair Dmt-A2B2 produced ca. 11.5 kb product.
The two fragments overlapped at both ends by a total of
ca. 2 kb.

Shotgun sequencing and assembly
PCR products (25 µl) were sonicated using Branson digital sonicator model 450 (Branson) at 20% power for 4
seconds to generate DNA fragments suitable for cloning
into a plasmid (400 bp to 2 kb). Sonicated PCR products
were treated with T4 DNA polymerase, Klenow DNA
polymerase and T4 polynucleotide kinase (all from Stratagene) according to manufacturer's protocol to blunt and
phosphorylate the ends. Treated DNA fragments were
electrophoresed through a 1% low melting agarose gel
(Bio-Rad). Fragments between 500 bp and 1.5 kb size
were cut out from the gel and cleaned using self-made
glassmilk as described previously [13]. The isolated DNA
fragments were ligated into pBluescript KS (-) (Stratagene)
vector pre-digested with SmaI (Stratagene). Nucleotide
sequencing of the cloned inserts was conducted by using
BigDye assay kit version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems) and
M13F/M13R sequencing primer [see Additional file 5) as
described previously [13]. One hundred and forty-four
clones with average insert length of 1 kb were sequenced;
representing at least 6 times coverage of each position in
the complete mitochondrial genome. Flanking vector
sequences were clipped automatically by using commercially available software Sequencher (GeneCodes) with
manual correction. Sequences were assembled by using
the same software. The complete sequence of Asian arowana mitochondrial genome was deposited in NCBI's Genbank [GenBank:DQ023143].
Identification of genes
tRNA genes were identified as described by Lowe and
Eddy [48] with a cove cutoff score of 0.1. Protein and
ribosome RNA genes were identified by sequence similarity to their orthologs from other mitochondrial genomes.
The 5' ends of protein-coding genes were inferred to be at
the first legitimate in-frame start codon (ATN, GTG, TTG
and GTT) [49] that did not overlap with the preceding
gene, except with an upstream tRNA gene and was limited
to the most 3' nucleotide of the tRNA. Protein gene termini were inferred to be at the first in-frame stop codon
(TAA, TAG, AGA and AGG). In some genes a T or TA
nucleotides adjacent to the beginning of a downstream
gene was designated as the truncated codon and assumed
to be completed by polyadenylation after transcript cleavage [35].
Base composition and codon usage
Editseq and GeneQuest software (both from Dnastar)
were used to analyze base composition and codon usage.
Compositional skew, which indicates compositional difference between the two strands, was calculated using the
following formula proposed by Perna and Kocher [50]:

GC skew = (G-C)/(G+C)

Page 10 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:242

and
AT skew = (A-T)/(A+T)
,where C, G, A, and T are the frequencies of the four bases
at third codon position of the eight fourfold degenerate
codon families.
Characterization of the AT microsatellite in the heavy
strand control region
A pair of primers (Dmt-MS-A/B, see Additional file 5) was
designed using PrimerSelect (DnaStar) to flank the microsatellite site in heavy strand control region. One of the
primers was labeled with a fluorescent dye 6FAM at the 5'
end. The PCR mastermix consisted of 1 × PCR buffer with
1.5 mM MgCl2 (Finnzyme), 200 nM primer, 400 µM
dNTP, 40 ng genomic DNA, and 1 U DyNAzyme polymerase (Finnzymes). The amplification was performed in a
PTC-100 PCR machine (MJ Research) using the following
program: 94°C for 2 min, 34 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec,
55°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 30 sec followed by a final
extension at 72°C for 5 minutes. PCR products were separated on an ABI 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) as described previously [13]. All six individuals
were genotyped to detect possible polymorphism.
Characterization of the long tandem repeat in the heavy
strand control region
For characterization of long tandem repeat in the heavy
strand control region, we designed one pair of primers
(Dmt-LA/LB, see Additional file 5) flanking the control
region using PrimerSelect (DnaStar). Complete heavy
strand control region was amplified from total genomic
DNA of the six individuals used earlier for microsatellite
genotyping under the following PCR conditions: 94°C for
3 min, 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec and
72°C for 1 min, followed by a final extension at 72°C for
5 minutes. PCR products were cleaned using home-made
glassmilk [47] before cloning into pGEM-T cloning vector
(Promega). Clones were sequenced from both directions
using M13F and M13R sequencing primers and BigDye
Assay Kit version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems). Forward and
reverse sequences were assembled by using Sequencher
(GeneCodes).

For detailed study of the control region tandem repeat
array, various Osteoglossiformes species (see Fig 2 for the
species used) and Anguilla species (see Fig 2 for the species
used) sequences were downloaded from NCBI Genbank.
A single unit from the various tandem repeat array were
then aligned using ClustalX [52]. Hairpin structure of a
repeat unit from the tandem repeat array was constructed
using Mfold [51].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/242

Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis was performed using mitochondrial
genome of eighteen fish species from representatives of
Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii taxa – among them all four
available full mtDNA from the Osteoglossiformes superorder – were used [see Additional file 1]. A shark species,
called spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias, Squaliformes,
Chondrichthyes) was used as outgroup. Four different data
sets were analysed: i) concatenated protein-coding, tRNA
and rRNA nucleotide sequences; ii) concatenated proteincoding and tRNA nucleotide sequences; iii) concatenated
protein-coding nucleotide sequences and iv) concatenated protein-coding amino acid sequences. Amino acid
sequences were aligned using ClustalX [52] then its nucleotide sequences were aligned with references to the amino
acid sequences alignment using CodonAlign 2.0 [53]) and
further edited manually. The full sequence of nad6
encoded by the L strand was excluded from the analysis,
due to the deviating nucleotide and amino acid composition of this gene as compared to those encoded by the H
strand. Third codons of the 12 heavy strand encoded protein-coding genes were excluded from the analysis
together with loops of tRNA. Each of the four datasets
were analyzed by maximum parsimony (MP) method in
MEGA version 3.1 [54], Bayesian inference (BI) method
using MRBAYES 3.1.2 [55,56] and maximum likelihood
(ML) using Tree-Puzzle version 5.2 [57] for amino acids
data set and TreeFinder version of May 2006 [58] for
nucleotide data sets.

For MP analysis 10 random additions were done using the
close-neighbour-interchange option with search level 1.
Bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates was conducted.
To find the best model for the nucleotides and amino acid
data sets, we applied Modeltest version 3.7 [59] and Prottest version 1.3 [60] respectively. The best-fit model was
GTR + I + G for all nucleotide data sets and mtRev + I + G
for the amino acid data set. BI method was performed for
106 generations using nucleotide data sets and 5 × 105
generations for the amino acid sequences data set. The
first 25% of samples were discarded as burn-in.
Quartet-based ML analysis for amino acid data set was
performed using TreePuzzle [57]. 1000 steps were performed and the mtRev24 substitution model was used.
For parameter estimation, quartet sampling and NJ tree
option was chosen. For ML analysis of nucleotides data
sets, the program TreeFinder [58] was used. GTR substitution model was used and bootstrap analysis was performed with 1000 replicates.
