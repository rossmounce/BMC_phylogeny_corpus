Abstract
Background: Salmonella paratyphi C is one of the few human-adapted pathogens along with S. typhi, S. paratyphi
A and S. paratyphi B that cause typhoid, but it is not clear whether these bacteria cause the disease by the same
or different pathogenic mechanisms. Notably, these typhoid agents have distinct sets of large genomic insertions,
which may encode different pathogenicity factors. Previously we identified a novel prophage, SPC-P1, in S.
paratyphi C RKS4594 and wondered whether it might be involved in pathogenicity of the bacteria.
Results: We analyzed the sequence of SPC-P1 and found that it is an inducible phage with an overall G+C content
of 47.24%, similar to that of most Salmonella phages such as P22 and ST64T but significantly lower than the
52.16% average of the RKS4594 chromosome. Electron microscopy showed short-tailed phage particles very similar
to the lambdoid phage CUS-3. To evaluate its roles in pathogenicity, we lysogenized S. paratyphi C strain CN13/87,
which did not have this prophage, and infected mice with the lysogenized CN13/87. Compared to the phage-free
wild type CN13/87, the lysogenized CN13/87 exhibited significantly increased virulence and caused multi-organ
damages in mice at considerably lower infection doses.
Conclusions: SPC-P1 contributes pathogenicity to S. paratyphi C in animal infection models, so it is possible that
this prophage is involved in typhoid pathogenesis in humans. Genetic and functional analyses of SPC-P1 may
facilitate the study of pathogenic evolution of the extant typhoid agents, providing particular help in elucidating
the pathogenic determinants of the typhoid agents.

Background
The bacterial genus Salmonella contains more than
2600 very closely related serovars, classified by the
Kauffmann-White Scheme according to their differences
in the somatic (O) and flagellar (H) antigens [1,2].
Although essentially all Salmonella bacteria are pathogens, they may have different host ranges or cause different diseases.
Over 1400 Salmonella serovars may infect humans,
with most of them causing self-limiting gastroenteritis.
On the other hand, a few Salmonella serovars, such as
Salmonella typhi, S. paratyphi A, S. paratyphi B and

S. paratyphi C, are adapted to humans and cause
typhoid fever, a serious and potentially fatal systemic
infection [3]. It is not clear whether these Salmonella
typhoid agents use the same, similar or totally different
pathogenic traits to infect the same host and cause the
disease. Genomic comparisons between S. typhi and
S. paratyphi A did not reveal a common genetic basis
possibly responsible for human adaptation or typhoid
pathogenesis [4,5]. Notably, various Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPIs) or prophages have been identified
in the Salmonella typhoid agents, e.g., SPI-7 in S. typhi
[6,7] and S. paratyphi C [8], and SPA-1, SPA-2 and
SPA-3 in S. paratyphi A [4], but their specific roles in
typhoid pathogenesis have not been well established.
In a previous study, we located several insertions in the
genome of S. paratyphi C strain RKS4594 by comparing it
with other Salmonella genomes [9], including one, SPCP1, which was a prophage present only in S. paratyphi C
among all sequenced Salmonella strains [8]. In this study,

we characterized this novel prophage, predicted its possible roles in the pathogenicity of S. paratyphi C, and evaluated its potential contributions to pathogenicity in animal
experiments. We found that, although no previously
known pathogenicity-associated genes were identified in
the prophage, SPC-P1 did increase the pathogenicity of
the bacteria.

Results
Genomic location and identification of prophage SPC-P1

We screened the complete nucleotide sequence of the S.
paratyphi C RKS4594 genome (CP000857) by Phage_Finder http://phage-finder.sourceforge.net for possible
prophage sequences and located five regions with typical
prophage characteristics, with four of them having been
reported in other Salmonella serovars and well studied
previously, including Gifsy-1 and Gifsy-2 in S. typhimurium LT2 [10] and SPA-1 and Phage SPA-3-P2 in S.
paratyphi A ATCC9150 [4]. These prophages have also
been known to be present in several other Salmonella
serovars, such as S. choleraesuis [11]. The remaining
genomic region corresponds to the previously mapped
39 kb insertion between genes purC and purF [9] and
has typical features of a prophage; here we designate
this region SPC-P1. Sequence analysis showed that SPCP1 lies between two adjacent genes, pgtE and yfdC, in S.
paratyphi C RKS4594, whereas in fifteen other published Salmonella genomes (see their accession numbers
below), we did not find DNA insertions in this region.
The ends of SPC-P1 were set by two direct repeats of
the sequence tggtgtcccctgcag, a typical feature for the
ends of prophage DNA sequences. One of the repeat
sequences begins at 109 bp upstream of SPC-P1 ORF1,
and the other begins at 165 bp downstream of ORF53
and continues with an arg tRNA gene. The total length
of SPC-P1 is 39,659 bp and the overall G+C content is
47.24%, which is similar to those of phage P22 (47.1%)
[12,13] and ST64T (47.5%) [14] and is significantly
lower than the 52.16% average of the S. paratyphi C
RKS4594 chromosome.
Layout and predicted products of SPC-P1 genes

Using Vector NTI 9.0 and GLIMMER3, we identified 53
ORFs in SPC-P1, designated consecutively from ORF1
through ORF53 (Additional file 1 Table S1), with the
ORF encoding the terminase small unit as ORF1. As
shown in Additional file 1 Table S1, the G+C contents
of individual ORFs vary from 31.65% (ORF 16) to
53.89% (ORF 48), demonstrating an obvious mosaic
structure.
Of the 53 ORFs, 47 had ATG and six (ORF13, ORF16,
ORF21, ORF29, ORF31, ORF44) had GTG as the start
codon. Functions of the SPC-P1genes were inferred
based on similarities with characterized genes from

Page 2 of 8

other phages; some salient features of these proteinencoding genes are summarized in Additional file 1
Table S1.
Three of the predicted SPC-P1 protein-encoding genes
(ORF16, ORF24, and ORF45) have no phage-borne
homologues in the current databases. However, it is
worthwhile to note that the deduced product of ORF16
shows a low but significant level of similarity with the
acyltransferase 3 of Pseudomonas syringae py. Syringae
B728a (Additional file 1 Table S1). On the other hand,
several bacteriophages such as Shigella flexneri bacteriophage Sf6 have O-antigen acetyltransferase gene in
their genomes. As the protein products of such genes
may alter the bacterial O-antigens [15], they likely
would make important contributions to the bacterial
virulence. The remaining 50 ORFs all have close homologues with previously characterized phages of enteric
bacteria. The ORFs can be divided into nine main clusters according to the predicted functions, which are
arranged in the following order: Head, Tail, Integration,
Ea region, Recombination, Immunity, Replication, Nin
region and Lysis (Figure 1). The gene cluster encoding
the phage head covers a large region and consists of
twelve ORFs. This region is closely related to the morphogenetic regions of previously characterized phages
such as CUS-3, HK620, Sf6, P22, ST104 and ST64, however none of the latter six phages has the whole set of
twelve ORFs seen in SPC-P1 (CUS-3, the most closely
related phage, has the first eleven ORFs but only part of
the twelfth ORF; Figure 1). The arrangement of the
ORFs in this part of SPC-P1 is similar to that of CUS-3,
Sf6 or HK620 in the gene order of 5’-small terminaselarge terminase-portal-decoration-coat-3’. This suggests
that ORF1-ORF12 define a type of head gene module,
which is highly conservative in these phages (See more
details in Additional file 1 Table S1). The gene cluster
encoding phage tail is composed of only one ORF,
ORF15, the deduced product of which shows certain
similarities to those of some known phages, such as
P22, ST104, ST64T, HK620, CUS-3 and Sf6. Additionally, SPC-P1 also contains gene clusters for phage integration (ORF17-18), recombination (ORF26-32),
immunity (ORF33-38), replication (ORF39-41) and lysis
(ORF50-53), suggesting that SPC-P1 encodes all functions required by and sufficient for an active phage.
Phylogenetic analysis of SPC-P1

Both nucleotide and deduced protein sequence homologies indicate that SPC-P1 is a member of the lambdoid
phage group and the predicted functions of the genes
are similar to those of lambdoid phages, especially to
CUS-3, HK620, Sf6, ST64T, P22 and ST104. Each of
these phages has about half of their deduced protein
products showing high similarity with those of SPC-P1,

providing evidence of mosaic architecture and extensive
recombination events creating SPC-P1 during evolution.
We chose twelve phages for comparisons with SPC-P1
using Mauve 2.3.1, which can produce a phylogenetic
tree of mosaic phage and prophage genomes. The phylogenetic tree thus obtained revealed that SPC-P1 is closest to CUS-3 (Figure 2).
Distribution of SPC-P1 in other Salmonella serovars and
among S. paratyphi C strains

To determine whether SPC-P1 is present in other Salmonella serovars, we searched the GenBank Nucleotide
collection (nr/nt) database and found that only some
segments of SPC-P1 could be found in S. choleraesuis
SC-B67 and S. paratyphi A ATCC9150. We then
searched other wild type strains of S. paratyphi C for
SPC-P1. Using primers amplifying six segments of SPCP1 with overlapping regions (Table 1), we amplified
regions of 407 to 7282 bp, 7217 to 13126 bp, 12813 to
19040 bp, 18726 to 25764 bp, 25409 to 32079 bp and

(Table 2).
Induction of SPC-P1 and morphological analysis

Since SPC-P1 seems to contain all necessary genes for a
viable phage, we wondered whether it could be induced
from the bacterial genome. Upon mitomycin C treatment, the culture of S. paratyphi C RKS4594 became
clearer than the culture without mitomycin treatment,
suggesting that phage were induced to lyse the cells.
For propagation and characterization of the induced
phage, we attempted finding a strain of S. paratyphi C
that is sensitive to the phage. We used the lysate of
RKS4594 after mitomycin C treatment to infect the
seven S. paratyphi C strains, whose PCR results were
negative for SPC-P1 (Table 2) and inspected plaque formation on them. We found plaques on strain CN13/87.
To confirm that the plaques were formed by SPC-P1,
we carried out PCR identification on the plaques; all six
segments of SPC-P1 were amplified by PCR with the six
pairs of primers (Figure 4 lanes 13-18).

Based on its genomic organization, we predicted that
SPC-P1 phage would resemble CUS-3 with a characteristic short tail. To validate its morphology, we singleplaque isolated SPC-P1 and propagated the phage on
CN13/87 for transmission electron microscopy. We saw
typical short-tailed phage particles (Figure 5).
Lysogenic conversion of CN13/87 by SPC-P1

Since SPC-P1 could be induced from the genome of S.
paratyphi C RKS4594 and strain CN13/87 is sensitive to
SPC-P1, we wondered whether SPC-P1 could lysogenize
CN13/87. SPC-P1 and CN13/87 were mixed at a multiplicity of infection of 1:100 and then co-cultured on LB
plates. Single colonies were isolated and infected with
SPC-P1 again. Three of the eight colonies, No. 3, 4 and
8 on the plate shown in Figure 6, were resistant to SPCP1, suggesting lysogenization by, and immunity to, SPCP1. We amplified all six segments of SPC-P1 from them,

representative results are shown in Figure 4.
Increased pathogenicity of lysogenized CN13/87 in mouse
infection experiments

Since ORF16 shows certain sequence similarity with the
acyltransferase 3 of Pseudomonas syringae py. Syringae
B728a and the O-antigen genes play important roles in
bacterial virulence, we wondered whether SPC-P1 might
be involved in pathogenicity of the bacteria. We orally
infected mice with 104, 105, 106, 107, 108 or 109 viable
bacterial cells (colony forming units, cfu) of wild type or
lysogenized CN13/87. We did not include the S. paratyphi C strain RKS4594, from which SPC-P1 was originally isolated, because we did not have a SPC-P1-free
RKS4594 so comparison of virulence between SPC-P1plus and SPC-P1-minus RKS4594 lines was not possible.
On day 7 after infection, we sacrificed the mice and cultured homogenized liver, lung and spleen tissues to
detect bacteria and determine the numbers of bacterial
cells that will be required to establish infection in half
of the inoculated mice (i.e., median infective dose, ID50).
The wild type and lysogenized CN13/87 strains demonstrated greatly different pathogenicity on the animals,
with ID50 values of 2.14 × 107 cfus and 6.76 × 104 cfus,

respectively (Table 3). All recovered bacteria were confirmed to be identical to those in the inocula by serological and phage tests and pulsed field gel electrophoresis
(data not shown). Pathological examinations showed
multiple organ damages in mice infected with 109 cells
of lysogenized CN13/87 (Figure 7).

Discussion
Bacteria evolve by accumulating mutations and incorporating laterally transferred genes, among which phages
are by far the most important driving force. For example, since the divergence from E. coli about 120-160 million years ago [16-18], Salmonella have developed into a
great number of distinct lineages, with more than 2600

serovars currently recognized [2]. They all share a core
genome, which is about 90% of the genes for Salmonella
subgroup I serovars, with the remaining ca. 10% genes
being specific to individual serovars [19]. Genomic analyses reveal that Salmonella harbor numerous temperate
bacteriophages [13,20-23]. In fact, most of the non-core
genome sequences are derived from phages, which play
key roles in bacterial genome evolution and pathogenicity. In this study, we characterized a novel prophage,
SPC-P1, in the genome of S. paratyphi C RKS4594 and
demonstrated that this phage is present only in S. paratyphi C strains but not in any other Salmonella serovars
tested. SPC-P1 exhibits typical characteristics of prophages, including a significantly lower overall G+ C content than that of the bacterial genome average, repeat
sequences at the ends of its genome, and tRNA genes at
the integration site. Sequence analysis showed that SPCP1 has a substantial portion of its genome being highly
related to previously characterized lambdoid phages and
it has a complete set of genes to encode a viable phage.
The mitomycin C induction test confirmed this.
Although prophages are widely found in bacterial genomes, most of them are defective, unable to produce
viable phage particles. Sequence analysis indicated close
relatedness of SPC-P1 to CUS-3 and electron microscopy also revealed morphological similarity between
SPC-P1 and CUS-3. Like CUS-3, SPC-P1 also has a
cosahedral head and a short tail. Since SPC-P1 could be
induced from the bacterial genome and we had available
the SPC-P1 sensitive strain CN13/87, we had the opportunity to propagate this phage for further studies. SPCP1 could not only lyse CN13/87 but also lysogenize it,
which allows us to study the possible roles of SPC-P1 in
bacterial pathogenicity.
S. paratyphi C is one of the few Salmonella serovars
that cause typhoid fever in humans, along with S. typhi,
S. paratyphi A and S. paratyphi B, but it is not fully
clear whether different Salmonella typhoid agents cause
the disease by similar or distinct mechanisms. Prophages
can contribute important biological properties to their
bacterial hosts and analysis of the prophages may shed

Page 6 of 8

light on the evolution of their hosts. Considering that
the human-adapted typhoid agents may have evolved by
convergent processes [8], we speculate that S. paratyphi
C may cause the disease by different mechanisms than
those used by other Salmonella typhoid agents. As SPCP1 is found only in S. paratyphi C, it may be involved
in the pathogenesis of typhoid caused by S. paratyphi C.
Taking the advantage that S. paratyphi C, unlike other
human-adapted Salmonella typhoid agents, can infect
hosts other than humans if large inocula are used
[24,25], we compared pathogenicity of S. paratyphi C
between SPC-P1-free and SPC-P1-lysogenized isogenic
strains. We found that SPC-P1 significantly increased the
pathogenicity of S. paratyphi C and caused multiple
organ damages in the animals (see Table 3 and Figure 7),
but the molecular basis is yet to be understood.

Conclusions
SPC-P1 contributes pathogenicity to S. paratyphi C in
animal infection models, so it is possible that this
prophage is involved in typhoid pathogenesis in humans.
Genetic and functional analyses of SPC-P1 may facilitate
the study of evolution of the different typhoid agents,
providing particular help in elucidating the pathogenic
determinants of the typhoid agents.
Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions

Bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 2
and detailed information on them can be obtained from
the Salmonella Genetic Stock Center http://www.ucalgary.ca/~kesander. Bacteria were grown overnight at 37°
C with shaking in LB broth.
Genome Sequencing

The genome sequence of RKS4594 was obtained from
several pUC18 genomic shotgun libraries using dye terminator chemistry on Megabace1000 and ABI3730 automated sequencers as described previously [8].
ORF prediction and homology search

Open reading frames (ORF) of SPC-P1 were predicted
by Vector NTI and Glimmer 3. Products of ORFs were
deduced based on homologies to known proteins by the
BLASTP server of NCBI. Similarity of nucleotide
sequence between SPC-P1 and the other completely
sequenced Salmonella prophages was evaluated by the
BLASTN server of NCBI.
G+C content analysis and tRNA prediction

The G+C content of each predicted ORF was analyzed
using the DNAstar software. tRNA was predicted
using tRNAscan-SE software http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/
tRNAscan-SE/.

Distribution of SPC-P1 in other S. paratyphi C strains

Genomic DNA of S. paratyphi C strains was isolated by
the Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (TIANZE, China). LA
taq polymerases were purchased from Takara. PCR reactions were performed as follows: 94°C, 1 min; 98°C,
20 sec; 68°C, 10 min, 30 cycles; 72°C, 10 min.
Induction of SPC-P1

S. paratyphi C RKS4594 was grown in LB medium at
37°C for 4 h, followed by addition of four times volume
of fresh LB. At this point, mitomycin C was added to a
final concentration of 0.5 μ/ml. The cultures were shaken, 120r/min, at 37°C for 14 h. Chloroform was added
to a final concentration of 1% to the culture, followed
by vortex of the culture for 1 min. Cell debris was
removed by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 10 min.
The supernatant containing SPC-P1 was preserved at
4°C until use.
Plaque formation test

S. paratyphi C strain CN13/87 did not harbor SPC-P1
and so was used as a recipient in the test. Ten-fold
serial dilutions of the bacterial lysate were made. Then
10 μl of a dilution and 100 μl of CN13/87 fresh culture
(4 h) were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 20 min
before addition of 3 ml 0.7% LB agar cooled to about
45°C. After mixing quickly, the 0.7% LB agar containing
the lysate and bacteria was spread to a 1.5% LB agar
plate, which then was cultured overnight. For identification, phage in individual plaques were picked up and
propagated on CN13/87 before DNA was extracted for
further PCR analysis and for transmission electron
microscopy.

exhibit significant homology to extant protein sequences. This file
includes the position of each ORFs in the chromosome of RKS4594, the
start and stop codon, the size, %G+C, homology proteins and the %
Identity range, E-value of each ORFs.

Lysogenization of strain CN13/87

CN13/87 was cultured at 37°C in 2 ml LB for 4 h. Then
10 μl SPC-P1 (108 pfu/ml) was added and the culture
was continued at 37°C overnight. Serial 10-fold dilutions
of the culture were spread onto LB agar plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. Single colonies were picked up
and spread uniformly onto fresh LB plates, eight colonies per plate. A small drop of SPC-P1 (about 5 μl) was
placed onto the bacterial patches. The plates were cultured overnight before inspection of SPC-P1 plaques on
the bacteria.
Animal infection experiments

Female BALB/c mice, 6-8 weeks old, were divided into
seven groups, twelve mice per group with six inoculated
with wild type CN13/87 and six with SPC-P1-lysogenized CN13/87 orally with 0.5 ml sterile water containing
no bacteria (group 1), 104 cfu/0.5 ml (group 2), 105 cfu/
0.5 ml (group 3), 106 cfu/0.5 ml (group 4), 107 cfu/0.5
ml (group 5), 108 cfu/0.5 ml (group 6) or 109 cfu/0.5 ml
(group 7). When the mice were sacrificed as specified,
