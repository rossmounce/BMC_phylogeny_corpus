Abstract
Background: Higher crustaceans (class Malacostraca) represent the most species-rich and morphologically diverse
group of non-insect arthropods and many of its members are commercially important. Although the crustacean
DNA sequence information is growing exponentially, little is known about the genome organization of
Malacostraca. Here, we constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library and performed BAC-end
sequencing to provide genomic information for kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus), one of the most widely
cultured species among crustaceans, and found the presence of a redundant sequence in the BAC library. We
examined the BAC clone that includes the redundant sequence to further analyze its length, copy number and
location in the kuruma shrimp genome.
Results: Mj024A04 BAC clone, which includes one redundant sequence, contained 27 putative genes and seemed
to display a normal genomic DNA structure. Notably, of the putative genes, 3 genes encode homologous proteins
to the inhibitor of apoptosis protein and 7 genes encode homologous proteins to white spot syndrome virus, a
virulent pathogen known to affect crustaceans. Colony hybridization and PCR analysis of 381 BAC clones showed
that almost half of the BAC clones maintain DNA segments whose sequences are homologous to the
representative BAC clone Mj024A04. The Mj024A04 partial sequence was detected multiple times in the kuruma
shrimp nuclear genome with a calculated copy number of at least 100. Microsatellites based BAC genotyping
clearly showed that Mj024A04 homologous sequences were cloned from at least 48 different chromosomal loci.
The absence of micro-syntenic relationships with the available genomic sequences of Daphnia and Drosophila
suggests the uniqueness of these fragments in kuruma shrimp from current arthropod genome sequences.
Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that hyper-expansion of large DNA segments took place in the kuruma
shrimp genome. Although we analyzed only a part of the duplicated DNA segments, our result suggested that it is
difficult to analyze the shrimp genome following normal analytical methodology. Hence, it is necessary to avoid
repetitive sequence (such as segmental duplications) when studying the other unique structures in the shrimp
genome.

Background
The genomes of crustaceans are extremely diverse in
their size, with the smallest one having a C-value of 0.14
pg and the largest one weighing 64.62 pg, differing by a
factor of 460 [1,2]. Despite their economic importance
and production in huge biomass, little is known about
the genome organization of crustaceans, especially Malacostraca (including shrimps and crabs) except for the
presence of numerous repetitive sequences [3-5].
Recently, although the genomic DNA sequence of a
crustacean, water flea Daphnia pulex, has been determined, it seems improper to make any conclusion on
the crustacean genome because recent phylogenetic analysis based on the DNA sequence data and morphology
comparison between Hexapoda (including insects) and
Crustacea provided an unexpected finding that Branchiopoda (including the water flea Daphnia) is phylogenetically much closer to Hexapoda rather than
Malacostraca [6-8]. Therefore, the crustacean genome,
in particular the genetic differences between Branchiopoda and Hexapoda group and other sister groups need
to be elucidated.
The penaeid shrimp, which is classified into Decapoda
in Malacostraca, has been the subject of intense
research. Due to its commercial value, several papers on
expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis and genetic linkage mapping has been published in the past few years.
However, in depth information of their large genome,
which is estimated to be about 70% of human genome
in size and rich in AT and AAT sequences, is largely
unknown [9-11]. As the first step towards understanding
the shrimp genome organization, we constructed a BAC
library (named MjBL2) from kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus) and performed BAC-end sequencing.
The results clearly showed extreme redundancy of certain sequences in many BAC clones of the MjBL2
library. We chose one BAC clone (Mj024A04) for
detailed analysis in terms of its entire sequence and
redundancy in the shrimp genome and found numerous
copies of DNA segments that contain the Mj024A04sequence. This indicates that hyper-expansion of such
peculiar DNA segments occurred through segmental
duplication events during evolution of the kuruma
shrimp genome.
Results
BAC library construction and BAC-end sequencing

To provide an overview of the composition and organization of the kuruma shrimp nuclear genome, we constructed BAC library (MjBL2) using kuruma shrimp
genomic DNA prepared from hemocytes of 13 shrimps
and analyzed the BAC-end sequence (BES). MjBL2 consists of 49,152 BAC clones, which were arrayed in 128

Page 2 of 12

microtiter plates and stored at -80°C. The average insert
size was estimated to be 135 kb by NotI digestion of
205 randomly selected BAC clones. BES analysis was
further performed using 192 BAC clones randomly
selected from MjBL2 and retrieved reads were
assembled for contiguity [DDBJ: AG993477-AG993734].
Resulting BESs were classified into 29 singletons and 51
contiguous sequences consisting of 2 to 24 reads. Notably, the BLASTN and BLASTX analyses revealed that
many of these BESs (20 reads in BLASTN, 55 reads in
BLASTX) contained a sequence encoding a protein
similar to “inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP)” reported
in black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) (see Additional
file 1).
DNA sequence of a representative BAC clone

One of the BAC clones (Mj024A04) that possessed a
sequence similar to “black tiger shrimp IAP” gene was
randomly selected from MjBL2 for detailed analysis of
its entire DNA sequence by employing shotgun sequencing method. The resulting genomic DNA sequence of
120 kb (Mj024A04-sequence) was analyzed by in silico
annotation, revealing 27 putative genes that apparently
seemed to be normal genomic region with exon-intron
structure (Figure 1, see Additional file 2 and Additional
file 3) [DDBJ: AP010878]. As shown in Figure 1, large
GGTTA repeats were found in the middle of the
sequence flanking gene 09, which encodes a protein
similar to a reverse transcriptase of Takifugu rubripes
[12]. Notably, of the other 26 genes, three genes (gene
01, 06, and 24) encode a protein homologous to IAP of
three species, Xenopus laevis (african clawed frog), Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) and Rattus norvegicus
(norway rat) and seven genes (gene 11, 13, 14, 15, 16,
17 and 18) were homologous to ORFs in “White Spot
Syndrome Virus (WSSV)”, the major shrimp pathogenic
dsDNA virus, which is highly virulent to penaeid
shrimps as well as other crustaceans such as crabs and
crayfish [13,14].
Redundancy of Mj024A04-sequence homologues in the
kuruma shrimp BAC library

To determine what portion of the Mj024A04-sequence
were redundant in the MjBL2-kuruma shrimp BAC
library, we performed colony hybridization using three
distinct probes that correspond to the 5’-end (F), middle
(M) and 3’-end (R) of the Mj024A04-sequence (primers
used for probe DNA amplification were shown in Additional file 4). Surprisingly, numerous BAC clones were
positive for at least one of the three distinct probes used
(200 out of 381: 52.5%; results are shown schematically
in Additional file 5) suggesting that relevant DNA fragments are highly redundant in the MjBL2-kuruma

shrimp BAC library. The 200 positive BAC clones were
sorted into 6 groups based on the hybridization pattern
(F, F+M, M, F+M+R, M+R and R) (Additional file 5).
Furthermore, we examined possible amplification of the
17 out of 27 putative genes (primers in Additional file
4) on 21 BAC clones (3 clones each from 7 groups) that
were proven to be independent by DNA fingerprinting
with restriction enzymes HindIII and EcoRI (see Additional file 6). Ten of the 17 genes (gene 01, 02, 03, 06,
08, 09, 22, 24, 25 and 27) were selected because they

match other genes in the databases with E-values less
than 1e-10 and the other seven (gene 11 and 13 to 18)
were selected because of their homology to WSSV
genes. As seen in Figure 2, two genes (01 and 02) were
present in group F; seven genes (01 to 03, 06, 08, 11
and 13) in group F+M; seven genes (03, 06, 08, 09, 11
13 and 14) in group M; all genes except gene 09 in
group F+M+R; twelve genes (09, 11, 13 to 18, 22, 24, 25
and 27) in group M+R; nine genes (14 to 18, 22, 24, 25
and 27) in group R. As expected, some genes were not

that showed different hybridization patterns with F, M and R probes (indicated in top line). Three BAC clones for each hybridization group were
tested. Reactions with three BAC clones that showed no signal (negative control: neg), Mj024A04 (positive control: pos) and without templates
(-) are also included.

detected because size of the inserted kuruma shrimp
DNA fragments in the selected BAC clones varied.
Nevertheless, it is noted that in the group F+M+R,
which were supposed to contain all genes, all of the
genes except gene 09, which was assigned as retro-transposon, were indeed detected (Figure 2). The independent amplifications of the retro-transposon (gene 09) in
the BAC clone samples can be explained by its known
nature, which tend to be randomly integrated [15,16].
Random appearance of the retro-transposon suggests
that the primordial DNA fragment is void of this gene.
Detection of Mj024A04-sequence and its copy number in
the kuruma shrimp genome

We next employed Southern blot hybridization to detect
multiple copies of Mj024A04-sequence in the kuruma
shrimp genome using several different restriction
enzymes. Results showed multiple DNA bands for each
of the 4 putative genes (gene 01, 09, 16 and 27) (Figure
3), confirming the presence of multiple copies of these
genes. In addition, we performed fluorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH) using labeled Mj024A04 BAC
clone. FISH images clearly showed numerous

Page 4 of 12

fluorescence spots in the nucleus of the adult shrimp
testis cells (Figure 4). With the duplication of the large
repeats, we further examined the copy number of the
putative genes by quantitative PCR of gene 01, 09, 16
and 27 using genomic DNAs prepared from 7 different
organs (brain, hemocytes, heart, testis, muscle, swimleg,
and intestine) and 3 larvae. Our results indicated that
copy numbers of those putative genes are 100 times
more than the putative single copy gene transglutaminase (TGase), except for the gene 09 (retro-transposon).
This suggested the presence of multiple copies of
Mj024A04-sequence (Figure 5). Taken all together, our
results suggest that large DNA fragment Mj024A04
occurs numerous times in the genome.
BAC genotyping and PCR detection of putative genes in
Mj024A04-sequence

To exclude a possible cloning bias, we performed BAC
genotyping using three microsatellite polymorphisms.
299 different genotypes out of 342 F, M, R positive BAC
clones screened from MjBL2 plate 001 to 008 representing 0.2 coverage of shrimp genome were detected (see
Additional file 7). PCR-based putative gene detection on

combinations of restriction enzymes as indicated at the top.

Data represent copy numbers of each gene relative to TGase with mean values ± standard deviation (bars) of three experiments.

eight independent BAC clones selected from different
genotypes showed the presence of almost all of the 17
putative genes (Figure 6). Assuming that all shrimps
have heterogeneous chromosomes, two genotypes from
one allele should be detected. Since we constructed
MjBL2 library from 13 individuals, at most 26 different
haplotypes were expected for one chromosomal locus.
The 299 different genotypes detected indicate that at
least 11 different chromosome loci contain duplications
of the entire Mj024A04-sequence. As we used only 342
BAC clones from MjBL2 plate 001 to 008, probability
estimation method was also performed to estimate how
many genotypes could be detected if we performed
screening and genotyping with excess BAC clones. This

is done with the assumption that all of genotypes were
present only once in the 86 diploid chromosomes of the
kuruma shrimp [9]. Result indicated 1240 genotypes
with 95% confidence interval 960 to 1658, suggesting
that at least 48 different chromosome loci might appear
in each haploid genome (see Additional file 8).

suggesting the uniqueness of Mj024A04-sequence within
known arthropod genomes.

Discussion
BAC library construction and BAC-end sequencing for a
first characterization of the kuruma shrimp genome

The amount of kuruma shrimp nuclear DNA has been
reported to be 2.83 pg indicating that kuruma shrimp
genome size is almost the same as other penaeid
shrimps such as Litopenaeus vannamei and Penaeus
monodon whose genome size are reported to be
approximately 2,000 Mbp [19]. In this study, we first
constructed BAC library from the kuruma shrimp. Average insert size of MjBL2 BAC clones were estimated to
be 135 kb and total MjBL2 insert size could be calculated as approximately 6,600 Mbp, showing that MjBL2
represented 3.3 times coverage of kuruma shrimp genome. Although MjBL2 is not suitable for physical mapping and genome sequencing because it was constructed
from 13 shrimps, MjBL2 is useful as the first step for
characterizing the kuruma shrimp genome. We performed BES analysis to acquire the first glimpse into the
sequence composition of the unsequenced kuruma

shrimp genome. The results of BES analysis were very
surprising because even with only 192 clones analyzed,
we detected 51 contigs and each contigs contained multiple reads varying from 2 to 24. This suggested that following the typical BAC construction method [20], we
obtained multiple copies of the same DNA fragments in
the kuruma shrimp genome. However, putative genes
such as black tiger shrimp IAP gene homologue that we
annotated by BLAST does not seem to be the gene that
has potential duplication activity like the transposable
elements. To further ascertain the abnormality of the
kuruma shrimp genome, we further analyzed these
DNA segment in the kuruma shrimp genome.
Gene contents of a representative BAC clone Mj024A04

Mj024A04 BAC clone randomly selected from BAC
clones that possessed black tiger shrimp IAP sequences
was fully sequenced and 27 genes were predicted in
silico. Of the 27 predicted genes, we found three genes
homologous to IAP. It is known that apoptosis is a
genetically programmed pathway of controlled cell suicide that has critical roles in several processes such as
development, tissue homeostasis, DNA damage
responses and pathological processes [21]. IAPs have
been shown to block apoptosis by inhibition of the

Koyama et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:141
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/141

proteolytic activity of caspases, the central components
of the apoptotic machinery, through direct binding of
Baculoviral IAP Repeat (BIR) domains present in the
IAPs [22]. Cellular homologues called the BIR-domaincontaining protein (BIRPs) are characterized by the presence of a variable number of BIR domains. These
homologues have been identified in yeasts, nematodes,
flies and higher vertebrates [21-23]. In Drosophila, four
kinds of IAP homologues (Thread or IAP1, IAP2, Bruce
and Deterin or CG12265) have been found [24]. We
analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of putative gene
01, 06 and 24 with other BIR domains in several organisms (see Additional file 9). The BIR domains in the
putative gene 24 were clustered together with the BIR
domains found in black tiger shrimp IAP gene, suggesting the putative gene 24 may have the same function as
black tiger shrimp IAP [25]. Particularly of interest,
putative gene 06 contains five BIR domains and this is
the first report on BIRPs containing more than three
BIR domains. BIR domains are known to play important
roles in protein-protein interactions and it has been
shown that the presence of multiple BIR domains in a
single protein molecule increases the affinity of BIRPs to
a target protein. In addition, the range of target molecules in which BIRPs can interact also increases with
the number of BIR domains [22]. Hence, putative gene
06 that has five BIR domains may be a novel BIRP that
has a different function.
Furthermore, of the other 24 genes, we found seven
genes homologous to ORFs in WSSV. It is known that
certain mammalian dsDNA viruses, such as herpesvirus
and poxvirus, mimic structure and function of host
genes to evade detection and destruction by the host
immune system [26]. Similarly, “potential horizontal
gene transfers” has been found in baculoviruses, infectious pathogens of insects [27,28], hence such viral genome structure can be regarded as repositories of
important information about host immune processes
[29]. The presence of multiple WSSV-like genes in kuruma shrimp genome strongly suggests similar mimicking mechanisms or horizontal gene transfers can also be
seen in this virus group. Moreover, with the absence of
homologous proteins in the current database, this information will provide a good starting point for understanding unknown WSSV-host interactions.
The first identification of multiple duplications of large
DNA segments in the shrimp genome

As high-resolution whole genome sequences are not yet
available for Malacostraca or Decapoda species, it is difficult to make any conclusion if multiple copies of peculiar large DNA segments (Mj024A04-sequence) found in
kuruma shrimp are also present in other species. However, micro-synteny analysis revealed that Mj024A04-

Page 7 of 12

sequence is not found in two other arthropod genomes,
Drosophila and Daphnia, suggesting that the duplicated
large DNA fragments have occurred after establishment
of Malacostraca in the Crustacea.
It is also unclear whether the redundancy is the result
of polyploidization or segmental duplication. Previous
studies revealed a wide range of chromosome numbers
and variation of genomic DNA content in several species in Decapoda, suggesting the possibility of polyploidization. However, re-association kinetics of genomic
DNA and electrophoretic analysis of enzyme polymorphism have suggested that polyploidization is considered to be a rare event [30,31]. Thus, we assumed
that highly redundant large DNA segments in the kuruma shrimp may have arose from segmental duplication
events.
Segmental duplications (SDs) are duplicated blocks of
genomic DNA, typically ranging in size from 1 kb to
200 kb [32]. SDs are composed of apparently normal
genomic DNA containing high-copy repeats and gene
sequences with intron-exon architecture, hence it is difficult to detect a priori without having well-assigned
genome information [32]. In this regard, the human
genome is the most studied genome about SDs. Human
reference genome contains an abundance of large DNA
segments with various copy numbers (from 2 to 18),
representing ≥ 5% of the genome, that have been accumulated through evolution over 40 million years [33].
These duplications are shown to be clustered up to 10fold enrichment within pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions of human chromosomes [32].
SDs are also reported in Drosophila melanogaster [34].
In fly, SDs account for ~1.4% of the genome (1.66 Mbp/
118.35 Mbp), ranging from 346 bp to 81.1 kb in length.
The Drosophila genome appears to be significantly poor
in large (>10 kb) duplicated blocks with only 7.21% as
compared to human genome. The chromosome 4 that
appears to be enriched in heterochromatic domains and
the pericentromeric regions of the chromosomes X, 2
and 3 in Drosophila have also high SD density.
It is reported that subtelomeres are notably rich in
degenerate telomeric repeats relative to adjacent singlecopy sequences or other genomic regions (~10- and
~100-fold, respectively) in the human genome [33]. We
analyzed the number of kuruma shrimp BAC clones
harboring GGTTA repeats based on colony hybridization [35]. Results showed that the rate of GGTTA-positive BAC clone are found to be 3 times higher in the
BAC clones positive for F, M or R probes than
GGTTA-positive rate in all BAC clones tested (45.4%
and 17.1%, respectively), suggesting that Mj024A04sequence and its duplicates are located predominantly
in subtelomeric regions and perhaps in pericentromeric
regions.

The absence of transcripts of putative genes in Mj024A04
in several tissues of an adult shrimp

We attempted to detect RNA transcripts for some putative genes analyzed in several tissues of kuruma shrimp
but gene expression was so weak despite their high copy
number. Together with subtelomeric localization, we
considered that this low level of gene expression might
be caused by epigenetic control mechanisms, such as
CpG-methylation, histone-hypoacetylation and histonemethylation. Although we have attempted to detect
CpG-methylation in Mj024A04 segments by genomic
Sourthern blot analysis with CpG-methylation insensitive restriction enzyme MspI and its sensitive isoschizomer HpaII, we could not detect any CpG-methylation
indicating that transcription level of Mj024A04 is strictly
suppressed by other factors (see Additional file 10).

electrophoresis on CHEF DR-II apparatus (BioRad).
Over 150 kb genomic DNA was extracted with NaI and
GELase (EPICENTRE), ligated into pBAC-lac vector and
used for transformation of E. coli DH10B T1 phage
resistant cells (Invitrogen). A total of 49,152 BAC clones
were picked and arrayed on 128 microtiter plates each
with 384 wells by Q-Pix (Genetix). High Density Replica
(HDR) filters were made using Bio Grid (Bio Robotics).
BAC-end sequencing was performed in Dragon Genomics Center (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) and retrieved
AB1 files were processed for clustering using Phred,
Phrap and Consed [38-40]. To identify significant
matches to the deposited sequences in the public database, BLASTN and BLASTX algorithms were employed
after masking repeat elements with RepeatMasker (version 3.2.8) [41] using cross-match as a search engine.

Conclusions
Genome rearrangements are common phenomena in the
eukaryotes, which facilitate not only species diversification but also genetic variation within species. Studies
based on the whole genome sequence in primates suggest that significant proportion of the lineage-specific
duplication results in different gene expression pattern
and mechanistic consequence of changes in the chromosome structure [36]. Furthermore, in a study on Plasmodium falciparum, a causative agent of severe human
malaria, the authors revealed that eight SDs, which are
located on seven different chromosomes, have copy
number polymorphism among different strains. The
expression levels of the genes found within the SDs are
also correlated in part with the gene copy number [37].
These studies strongly suggest that SDs are widely distributed and play significant roles in making biological
differences among closely related species. Biological significance of SDs in kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus is still obscure due to lack of the entire genome
sequence information of Decapoda species. Nonetheless,
it is interesting how SDs and numerous putative genes
such as WSSV homologues act in this species. Furthermore, such hyper-expansion of DNA segments should
be taken into serious consideration in whole-genome
sequencing and effective construction of genetic linkage
maps of this economically important species.

Kuruma shrimp BAC library (MjBL2) was constructed
according to the protocol as described previously, with
minor modification [20]. Briefly, hemocytes from 13
kuruma shrimps were embedded in 1% low melting
agarose plugs and digested in the presence of proteinaseK. Those high molecular weight DNA were partially

Shotgun library was made from purified DNA of
Mj024A04 BAC clone using shotgun library construction

following manufacturing instruction. Sequence reactions
were performed with SP6 and T7 primers using BigDye
Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) following manufacturing instruction and electrophoresed with ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied
Biosystems). Retrieved AB1 files were base-called and
assembled by Phred, Phrap and Consed [38-40]. The
sequence gaps were closed using a combination of resequencing of shotgun clones and BAC direct sequencing. Presumative genes were predicted by GENSCAN
[42]. Amino acid sequences of presumed genes were
annotated using BLASTP algorithm. Micro-synteny analysis was performed by applying TBLASTN algorithm
onto two databases FlyBase (version FB2008_02) [17] and
wFleaBase (first release, 2007/07/07) [18].

performed with the probe labelled with [a- 32 P]dCTP
using Random Primer DNA Labeling Kit Ver. 2 (Takara)
at 42°C in PerfectHyb hybridization solution (TOYOBO)
for 4 hrs and washing were carried out 3 times with
2× SSC/0.1% SDS at 50°C for 30 min. The autoradiogram was developed with a STARION FLA-9000 Reader
(Fujifilm).
Chromosomal localization of Mj024A04-sequence

Mj024A04 BAC DNA was fluorescent labeled as a FISH
probe by nick translation method using the FISH Tag
DNA Multicolor kit (Invitrogen) according to manufacture’s instructions. The specimens were prepared from
the testis cells according to the previous report [43].
After the final heat denaturation of labeled probe and
heat denaturation and dehydration of the specimens,
hybridization was performed in 2× SSC/65% formamide
hybridization buffer at 37°C for 24 hrs. Washings were
performed three times with 2× SSC/50% formamide,
1× SSC and 4× SSC/0.1% Tween 20, respectively at 45°
C for 5 min. Finally, the specimens were counterstained
with Hoechst 33258 (Invitrogen) and examined under a
Nikon Eclipse E600 epifluorescence microscope (Nikon).
Photographs were taken with a MicroMax Cooled-CCD
and IPLab software (Nippon Roper).
Copy number estimation of Mj024A04 genes

Primer pairs for quantitative PCR were designed for 4
predicted genes (gene 01, 09, 16 and 27) and the putative single copy gene, transglutaminase (TGase;
DQ436474), using Primer Express Software Version 3.0
(Applied Biosystems) (primers were shown in Additional
file 4). 0.1 ng of the kuruma shrimp genomic DNA were
prepared from the brain, hemocytes, heart, testis, muscle, swimleg, intestine and 3 larvae were used as template in a 20 μl reaction mixture containing 10 μl of
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix reagent (Applied Biosystems), 1 μl of genomic DNA template or plasmid containing target DNA sequences as standard, 8.2 μl of
deionized water and 0.4 μl of 10 μM forward and
reverse primer. PCR reactions were performed and
quantified by the 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems). All of PCR reactions were performed as
follows: 50°C for 2 min and 95°C for 10 min, followed
by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 1 min, with
a dissociation stage at 95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 30 sec
and 95°C for 15 sec. The PCR reaction was repeated
three times for each template. The copy number of each
putative gene was estimated by absolute quantification
method and Ct values of the amplified target genomic
DNA fragments in each sample were computed by the
SDS program, using default parameters.

BAC genotyping using microsatellites

MjBL2 BAC clones showing positive signals against F,
M and R probes, which correspond to the 5’-end (F),
middle (M) and 3’-end (R) of the Mj024A04-sequence,
were used for BAC genotyping with 3 microsatellite
markers (MS02, MS33 and MS64; primers used for
probe DNA and microsatellite repeats amplification
were shown in the Additional file 4). Approximately 15
ng of BAC DNA was used as template in a 10 μl reaction mixture containing 1 μl of 10× Ex Taq buffer, 1 μl
of dNTP mixture (2.5 mM each), 0.1 μl of Ex Taq (5 U/
μl) (Takara), 1 μl of BAC DNA template, 0.1 μl of 100
μM forward and reverse primer and 6.7 μl of deionized
water. PCR reactions were performed by TGradient
Thermocycler96 (Biometra) with following condition:
first denaturation step at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 40
cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, appropriate annealing temperature for 30 sec and 72°C for 30 sec and a final
extension step at 72°C for 5 min. Appropriate annealing
temperature determined for each primer pair was 57°C
for MS02 and 59°C for MS33 and MS64. Amplified fragments were separated and detected with ABI PRISM
3100 Genetic Analyzer and signal intensity was scored
with GeneScan and Genotyper software following
instruction manuals (Applied Biosystems). Based on the
results obtained from BAC genotyping of 342 BAC
clones, we estimated the probable number of different
genotypes if more BAC clones (>342) were used for
screening and genotyping. The random sampling of size
N was performed with the assumption that a population
having θ different genotypes was present with the same
abundance. The population was supposed to be large
enough so that sampling with replacement is satisfied.
Then, let Yi be a random outcome in the i-th sampling
as follows:
⎧ 1 if the genotype in the i-th sample is newly observed
Yi = ⎨
⎩ 0 o.w.

The probability distribution of the initial trial is
obviously given as Pr (Y 1 = 1) = 1. Furthermore, the
conditional distribution of Yi given previous outcomes is
expressed by
Pr ( Yi = 1 Yi −1 = y i −1 ,  , Y1 = y1 ) =

 − ∑ij−1 y j
=1


.

We now focus on the distribution of an observed
number of different genotypes,
Kn =

∑

n
i =1

Yi .

The conditional distribution of Kn is easily given as
Pr ( K n = k + 1 K n −1 = k ) =
Pr ( K n = k K n −1 = k ) =

 −k
,


k
.


Then, a recursive formula for the marginal distribution of Kn can be derived as
Pr ( K n = k ) = Pr ( K n = k K n −1 = k ) Pr ( K n −1 = k )

+ Pr ( K n = k K n −1 = k − 1 ) Pr ( K n −1 = k − 1 )

=

 − ( k −1 )
k
Pr ( K n −1 = k ) +
Pr ( K n −1 = k − 1 ) .



once the outcome of KN by the random sampling of
size N is observed, a likelihood function of θ (say L(θ))
can be obtain through its probability distribution, which
is calculated by the recursive formula above. The parameter θ is then estimated by maximizing L(θ). The 100
(1-a)% confidence interval is also derived by the likelihood profile as

{ −2 log(L( ) / L( )) <  (1 −  ) } ,
2

ˆ
where  is the maximum likelihood estimated of θ and
2
c (1-a) is the upper 100 a-percent of the c2 distribution
with the degree of freedom 1.
