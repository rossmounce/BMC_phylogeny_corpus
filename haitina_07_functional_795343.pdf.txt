Abstract
Background: The melanocortin (MC) receptors have a key role in regulating body weight and
pigmentation. They belong to the rhodopsin family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The
purpose of this study was to identify ancestral MC receptors in agnathan, river lamprey.
Results: We report cloning of two MC receptors from river lamprey. The lamprey receptors,
designated MCa and MCb, showed orthology to the MC1 and MC4 receptor subtypes,
respectively. The molecular clock analysis suggested that lamprey MC receptor genes were not
duplicated recently and diverged from each other more than 400 MYR ago. Expression and
pharmacological characterization showed that the lamprey MCa receptor was able to bind and be
activated by both lamprey and human MSH peptides. The lamprey MCa receptor had relatively high
affinity for ACTH derived peptides similarly to the fish MC receptors. We found that both of the
lamprey MC receptors were expressed in skin, while the MCb receptor was also found in liver,
heart and skeletal muscle.
Conclusion: This study shows presence of MC receptors in agnathans indicating early signs of
specific functions of melanocortin receptor subtypes.

Background
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest
superfamily of membrane proteins and serve as targets for
more than 30% of all modern drugs. The rhodopsin family is the largest within the GPCR superfamily and
includes the α-, β-, γ- and δ-subgroups [1]. The α group of

rhodopsin GPCRs includes melanocortin (MC) receptors.
The ligands for the MC receptors are the melanocortic
peptides: α-, β-, γ-melanocyte stimulating hormones
(MSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), all
derived from the precursor proopiomelanocortin
(POMC). In addition the MC receptors bind the agouti

signalling peptide (ASIP) and agouti related protein
(AGPR) that are endogenous antagonists that regulate pigmentation and food intake through the MC1 and MC4
receptors, respectively. The MC receptors are found in five
subtypes in mammals and birds, named MC1-MC5 receptors [2,3]. The MC receptor subtypes have very different
physiological roles but the MC4 receptor has received
extraordinary attention, as it is the most recognized
monogenic cause for obesity [4]. MC4 receptor agonists
reduce food intake [5] and MC4 receptor antagonists are
very efficient in increasing food intake and body weight
[6]. The MC4 receptor and the MC3 receptor, which is also
involved in regulating energy homeostasis, are some of
the most pursued drug targets among GPCRs [7].

most distantly related to mammals. Degenerative
sequences for melanotropins (MSH) and corticotropin
(ACTH) peptides were found to be encoded by two distinct genes [19].
In this paper we report the cloning of two MC receptors
from river lamprey and a fragment of MC receptor from
hagfish. These receptors are the most ancient MC receptors found to date. We expressed one of the lamprey receptors and performed thorough characterization of its
pharmacological properties with respect to both human
and lamprey melanocortin peptides. Moreover, we show
the anatomical distribution of the two lamprey receptors.

Results
We have previously demonstrated the presence of MC
receptors in teleost fishes [8,9] and that the MC4 receptor
plays an important role for regulation of food intake in
teleosts [10,11]. We have also shown that the MC4 receptor is likely to regulate food intake in birds [12]. The
zebrafish has six MC receptors due to an additional copy
of the MC5 receptor, which we suggest was created
through a tetraploidization within the teleost lineage. The
teleost Fugu has only four MC receptors as it is lacking the
MC3 receptor [8]. Moreover, there are some differences in
the ligand preference between teleosts and mammals:
ACTH seems to play a more prominent role for the MC
receptor in Fugu and trout as compared with α-MSH [13],
which is selective to four MSH binding MC receptors in
mammals. Furthermore, we recently cloned and characterised MC3, MC4 and MC5 receptors from another gnathostome, the spiny dogfish. The results showed high
conservation in sequence and pharmacology compared to
human orthologs [14,15], but it is still not known if cartilaginous fishes have any other types of MC receptors. It
also remains unknown if MC receptors can be found in
more ancient species.
The only extant jawless vertebrates are lamprey and hagfish that form unique basal groups in the craniate lineage
intermediate between Amphioxius (protochordate) and
gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates). It is proposed that lineages leading to lamprey and hagfish underwent one
large-scale genome duplication, whereas the second doubling may have occurred in the gnathostome ancestor lineage. The agnathans differ from other vertebrates by
lacking bone tissue and a biting apparatus. They have
been suggested to have diverged from the lineage leading
to mammals 564 Myr ago [16,17] and represent some of
the key species whose genomes have not been sequenced.
The MSH ligands are all derived from POMC, which has
been intensively studied in lower vertebrates and it seems
that the POMC gene has arisen early in chordate evolution
[18]. Among the POMC genes that have been cloned, the
two POMC genes from the agnathan lamprey are the ones

Cloning of melanocortin receptors from hagfish
The degenerate PCR using genomic DNA from Atlantic
hagfish resulted in a fragment of approx 400 bp. The fragment was cloned and sequenced. The sequence was
blasted against the GenBank database, which indicated
high similarity to MC receptors. The clone was used for
high stringency screening of Atlantic hagfish genomic
library in lambda GEM-11. The screening did however not
result in any positive full-length clones from this library.
Cloning of melanocortin receptors from river lamprey
The degenerate PCR on genomic DNA of river lamprey
resulted in two fragments of approx 400 bp. The fragments were cloned and sequenced. Two different
sequences were blasted against the GenBank database and
showed similarity to MC receptors. The clones were used
for high stringency screening of a river lamprey genomic
library. Two positive cosmid clones were isolated and
sequenced. Both clones were found to contain the same
intronless gene of 1023 bp, corresponding to a putative
MC receptor of 341 amino acids. The sequences of both
clones were found to be identical to only one of the MC
receptor fragments obtained from the PCR. Repeated
screening with another fragment as a probe did not result
in any other cosmid clone from this library.

In order to obtain the entire coding region of the second
MC gene, we performed inverse PCR on lamprey genomic
DNA, as previously described [14]. We were able to extend
the sequence in both 3' and 5' directions and overlap the
stop codon, but not the initiating ATG codon. The
genome sequencing reads of sea lamprey, Petromyzon
marinus were downloaded from [20]. The database was
formatted with Formatdb [21]. We searched for MC receptor like sequences in the formatted database using Blastall.
The sequences with highest similarity score were used to
design primers in the proposed N terminal regional of the
second lamprey receptor. The full-length gene was amplified from river lamprey genomic DNA using Pfx polymerase. The fragment was purified and sequenced. The full-

a putative lamprey receptor of 336 amino acids was
obtained.

not conclusive regarding whether the divergence occurred
before or after the lamprey split from the lineage leading
to mammals.

The amino acid sequence alignment of the new river lamprey genes and the partial sequence from hagfish together
with human, chicken and zebrafish MC receptors is displayed in Figure 1. The percent identities of amino acid
sequences are shown in Additional file 1. The lamprey
receptor of 341 amino acids exhibits the highest identity,
50–55%, to the MC4 and MC5 receptor subtypes and 48–
55% to the MC3 receptors, while the identity to the MC1
receptors is lower, 46–51%. This lamprey receptor has the
lowest similarity to the MC2 subtype, 35–43%. This river
lamprey receptor was designated MCa receptor. The lamprey receptor of 336 amino acids showed the highest
identity of 60–67% to the MC4 and MC5 receptor subtypes and 58–62% to the MC3 subtype, while the similarity to the MC1 and MC2 subtypes was lower, 46–55% and
44–47% respectively. This river lamprey receptor was
named MCb receptor. The similarity between the MCa
and MCb receptors was 52%. The partial sequence from
hagfish showed the highest similarity to MC4 and MC5
subtypes, 56–63% and 59–63%, respectively. The similarity to MC3 subtype was lower, 50–59%, followed by MC1
subtype (50–53%) and MC2 subtype (44–50%). The similarity between hagfish fragment, named MCc receptor,
and the corresponding sequence of lamprey MCa and
MCb receptors was 54 and 65%, respectively.

Competition and saturation binding experiments on
lamprey MC receptor
The lamprey MCa receptors were expressed in the HEK293 EBNA cell line and tested for binding human and
lamprey melanocortin peptides. Figure 4 presents saturation and competition curves for the lamprey MCa receptors and Table 1 displays Kd and Ki values obtained from
saturation and competition experiments, respectively. For
comparison, the table also includes previously published
results for the human MC receptors tested with the same
methodological approach. The results demonstrate that
the ligands bind to a single saturable site in the lamprey
receptors. The endogenous human ligands α-MSH (p <
0.01), β-MSH, γ-MSH (p < 0.01), ACTH(1–39) (p < 0.01)
and truncated ACTH (1–17), ACTH(1–24) had clearly
lower affinities for the lamprey MCa receptor, compared
to the human MC1 and MC3 receptors, while the same
ligands had clearly higher affinities for the lamprey MCa
receptor, compared to the human MC4 and MC5 receptors. The synthetic ligands MTII and HS024, however,
bound the lamprey MCa receptor with clearly lower affinities than the human MC1, MC3, MC4 and MC5 receptors. The affinity of lamprey MCa receptor to the lamprey
peptides was not higher than for the human peptides. The
MSH-B had the highest affinity of 352 nM, followed by
ACTH(1–31) with 497 nM and the MSH-A with the lowest affinity of 1.50 μM (p < 0.01).

Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis was performed using Neighborjoining method and a tree of the MC receptors is presented in Figure 2 and Additional file 2. The topology of
the trees was the same with or without out-group (data
not shown). In both trees, the lamprey MCa receptor
branched at the base of the MC1 receptor group with
bootstrap values 782 and 820. In both trees the lamprey
MCb receptor branched at the base of the MC4 receptor
group with bootstrap values of 442 and 787. The partial
hagfish MCc receptor branched at the base of the MC1
and MC2 receptor groups (data not shown).
Molecular clock analysis
The theoretical time of divergence of agnathans is estimated 564 MYR for molecular and 525 MYR for fossil data
[16]. The MC receptor subtypes displayed different
sequence divergence rates as is illustrated in Figure 3. The
evolutionary rate of lamprey MCa receptor was most similar to the MC1 receptor subtype. Considering the MC3/4/
5 receptor cluster, the lamprey MCb receptor had the
divergence rate most similar to the MC4 receptor subtype.
This analysis indicated that the MCa and MCb receptors
diverged from each other more than 400 MYR. Due to the
possible differences in evolutionary rates, this analysis is

Measurement of intracellular cAMP in HEK-293 EBNA
cells expressing lamprey MC receptor
The lamprey MCa receptors were expressed in HEK-293
EBNA cells and tested for ability to couple to G-protein
and induce the accumulation of cAMP. Human α-MSH,
ACTH (1–24) and lamprey MSH-A, MSH-B and ACTH (1–
31) were used as ligands. The results are presented in Figure 5. All of the ligands were able to stimulate the accumulation of cAMP. The EC50 value for α-MSH was 49.1
nmol/L, while the ACTH(1–24) displayed lower affinity
of 172 nmol/L. The lamprey peptides had higher EC50
values than human peptides: 913 nmol/L for MSH-B (p <
0.01) and 1304 nmol/L for MSH-A (p < 0.01). Stimulation with ACTH(1–31) did not result in a full response.
Tissue distribution of lamprey MC receptors
The tissue distribution of the lamprey was determined by
RT-PCR. The quality of the mRNA was tested with RT-PCR
using β-actin primers and is demonstrated in Additional
file 3. The results for both lamprey receptors are shown in
Figure 6. Each pair of PCR primers was designed to be specific for only one of the receptor subtypes. The specificity
of the PCR reactions was estimated by hybridization blot

with the lamprey MC receptor subtype specific probes.
There was no cross-hybridization detected between samples (data not shown). A strong signal for the lamprey
MCa receptor was detected in the skin. Other tissues did
not show the presence of the MCa receptor. Unlike the
MCa receptor, the MCb receptor was detected in several
tissues. The strongest signal appeared in the liver, while
slightly weaker signal was detected in the skin, and finally,
two weak signals, only detectable on the Southern blot
were found in the heart and muscle of the lamprey. Neither MCa, nor MCb receptors were detected in the brain of
the river lamprey.

Discussion
For the first time, we show the presence of MC receptors
in agnathans, both the river lamprey and the Atlantic hagfish. This finding is important as the agnathans are among
the most ancient living vertebrates. The phylogenetic and
molecular clock analysis indicated that lamprey MCa
receptor belongs to the MC1 receptor subtype, while lamprey MCb receptor belongs to the MC4 receptor subtype
(see Figure 2 and Additional file 2). However, the amino

were calculated with Tree-Puzzle v 5.2. Lamprey MCa (open

used the following divergence times from human: mouse –
90(70), chicken – 310(310), zebrafish – 450(420), dogfish –
528 (420) and lamprey – 564 (525) Myr ago. The corresponding calculated distances were plotted against molecular
and fossil data for each receptor subtype separately. The

acid identity analysis indicated that both receptors are
most similar to the MC4 and MC5 receptors.
It is well known that different proteins evolve at different
rates because of natural selection for functions [16]. Our
molecular clock analysis highlights the differences in the
sequence divergence rates between the MC1-2 receptor
subtypes, that seem to evolve fast, and the MC3-4-5 subtypes that evolve slower (see Figure 3). This is confirmed
by amino acid analysis of the different subtypes that for
example show much higher similarity to the MC3-4-5
receptors in mammals and fish as compared with the MC1
and MC2 receptors (see Additional file 1). While the MCb
receptor clearly seems to belong to the rather slowly evolving MC3-4-5 cluster that surely must have existed prior to
the split of agnathans from the lineage of chordates, the
MC1 receptor character of the MCa receptor may suggest
that an ancestor to the MC1 receptor was also present at
this stage in evolution. It is interesting to note that the percentage identity between the MCa and MCb receptors is
much lower than for example the dogfish MC4 or MC5
receptors, which are the evolutionary most closely related

MC receptors identified so far. It seems thus clear that
these two lamprey receptor genes were not duplicated
recently. The molecular clock analysis supports this, placing the divergence of these two genes more than 400 MYR
ago. None of the ancestral MC receptors displayed any
high similarity to the MC2 (ACTH) receptor subtype. This
could mean that either there exists an additional subtype
in lamprey with MC2 receptor characteristics or that the
MC2 receptor appeared at a later stage. We could not identify any MC receptors in invertebrates or in the tunicate
Ciona, despite our very comprehensive searches with
HMMs, which has in our hands proven to be a very effective tool to find divergent sequences [22,23]. Moreover,
our initial searches indicate that the cephalochordate
amphioxus does not have any MC receptors either (data
not shown). This suggests that the MC receptor family
appeared first in the agnathan lineage, after the divergence
of craniates (vertebrates), but before the appearance of
jawed vertebrates. Taken altogether, the genes we isolated
and characterised here, could code for the most ancestral
MC receptors.
It has previously been reported that orthologs to the large
precursor peptide, proopiomelanocortin (POMC) are
found in lamprey and that these are encoded by two
genes, POM (proopiomelanotropin) and POC (proopio-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/101

cortin). POM encodes β-endorphin and two degenerated
sequences termed MSH-A, MSH-B, while POC encodes
another β-endorphin and an ACTH like sequence [19].
The position of MSH-B corresponds to that of ACTH,
while the position of MSH-A corresponds to that of βMSH in mammalian POMC. The mammalian and fish
melanocortin peptides (α-, β- and γ-MSH) cannot be distinguished. Similarity in exon/intron organization, the
position of β-endorphin and ACTH/MSH-B suggests that
POM and POC appeared from a duplication of an ancestral POMC gene [24]. It seems thus clear that ancestral
(prior to the split of lamprey) POMC gene contained
orthologs of both ACTH and β-endorphin. The core binding sequence HFRW is conserved between human and sea
lamprey melanocortin peptides but α-MSH and ACTH
(not β-, γ- or δ-MSH) have much larger conserved motif
SYSMEHFRWGKP in all species described so far, except
the gecko Eublepharis macularius, [25]. For lamprey MSHA, MSH-B and ACTH, this common motif looks like
xYxMxHFRWGxP [26]. It was therefore interesting to test
if these four amino acid substitutions would affect the
pharmacology. Because we had ancestor-like MC receptor
clone from river lamprey, we decided to synthesize the
melanocortin peptides from lamprey and test their pharmacological properties with this receptor. We showed that
the lamprey MCa receptor was able to bind both lamprey
and human endogenous MSH peptides as well as their
synthetic analogues. This could be related to the fact that
the core binding sequence of the MSH peptides (HFRW)
is well conserved in the lamprey. The ability of the lamprey receptor to bind all the MC ligands that we tested
shows that the lamprey MCa receptor is indeed a MSH
binding receptor and that it does not have the MC2
(ACTH) receptor subtype characteristics to bind only
ACTH, but not MSH peptides. The binding profile of this
lamprey receptor is not in particular similar to the MC1
receptors, having much lower affinities for all MC receptor
ligands. It did neither have the characteristics of the mammalian MC4 receptor, which has preference to β-MSH and
low affinity to γ-MSH, or the mammalian MC3 receptor,
which has preference to γ-MSH. Despite the generally low
affinity of the MCa receptor it still binds all human ligands with higher affinities than the human MC5 receptor.
The potency order of the lamprey MCa receptor was most
similar to the dogfish MC3 receptor [14], while affinity
levels in general were most similar to the trout MC4 and
MC5 receptors [27]. Interestingly, the MCa receptor shows
higher affinity for γ-MSH and ACTH than the human MC4
and MC5 receptors. All this points to the direction that the
ancestral MC receptors had a rather promiscuous binding
profile and that the specification of the different subtypes
has occurred at a later stage in the evolution. The lamprey
receptor had highest affinity for the ACTH(1–17). We

before other ligands [13,14,27]. This pharmacology of the
lamprey receptor further supports our previous hypothesis that ACTH peptides could have acted as the "original" ligand at the MC receptors. It is also notable that the
lamprey receptor has higher affinity to the lamprey ACTH
peptide and the relatively similar MSH-B peptide, as compared with MSH-A, which also support this hypothesis.
The low affinity of MSH-A may indicate that there is
another MC receptor in lamprey that has this peptide as
ligand, and that could obviously be the MCb receptor.
Moreover, we demonstrated the ability of the lamprey
MCa receptor to functionally couple to the Gs pathway in
response to human and lamprey endogenous ligands.
This is in line with all previously characterised MC receptors further adding evidence to the notion that the coupling preferences of GPCRs are in general very well
conserved through the evolution.
We found that both of the lamprey MCa and MCb receptors are expressed in the skin, while the MCb receptor was
also found in liver, heart and skeletal muscle. The skin is
one of the major sites of expression for the mammalian
MC1 receptor and the role of ACTH peptides for skin pigmentation has been highlighted in several studies [28].
Our new results on the lamprey receptors may indicate
that the skin is one of the original sites of expression for
the MC receptors. The fact that this receptor binds ACTH

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/101

with relatively high affinity could fit with a conserved role
of ACTH in pigmentation. Like the MCb receptor, MC5 is
expressed in liver, heart and skeletal muscle in mammals
[29]. These findings lend further support to similarities of
the MCa receptor with the MC1 receptor and the MCb
receptor with the MC3-4 and -5 receptors. The POM and
POC genes we previously found to be expressed in pars
intermedia and pars distalis, respectively, of lamprey pituitary [26]. Neither of the lamprey MC receptors was
detected in the brain. This could suggest that the melanocortin system functioned primarily as endocrine hormonal system where the melanocortin peptide hormones
were released centrally to reach the receptors in peripheral
tissues such as the skin. This is in line with how ACTH
works for the adrenal MC2 (ACTH) receptors while it is in
stark contrast to how POMC products work for the other
receptors where they act as local hormones in the brain
(MC3 and MC4) and the skin (MC1). This could suggest
the melanocortin system acted originally in an endocrine
hormonal fashion while the function to act as a local hormonal system evolved later. Our previous findings in several fish species such as the spiny dogfish, Fugu and
zebrafish show important central expression pattern for
the MC receptors. This could suggest that the central functions for MC receptors developed after the split of agnathans but prior to the split of gnathostomes. It is also
possible that the central functions were developed more
early on, but that these may have been lost in the lineage
leading to lamprey that could be related to parasitic living
conditions of these species. Moreover, it is also possible
that there exist additional lamprey MC receptors with central functions, but that we were unable to isolate them.
Recent evolutionary theories suggest that duplicate genes
more commonly survive by function partitioning or subfunctionalization, rather than acquiring new functions
[30]. The unique location of the MCa receptor in the skin
and wide distribution of the MCb receptor in skin, liver,
heart could indicate subfunctionalization. It is possible
that the MCa receptor took over the function in the skin
from the wide range of functions of ancestral gene and
that the specialisation, which is so apparent for the mammalian MC receptor subtypes, took place later for the
MCb receptor subtype.

Conclusion
In summary, we have described MC receptors in the most
ancient living vertebrate, the river lamprey. We have characterized these ancestral receptors by phylogeny, evolutionary divergence rate, pharmacology and anatomical
distribution. We show that a lamprey MC receptor can
bind MSH peptides and like non-mammalian vertebrates,
have preference to human ACTH peptides before other
ligands. The anatomical characterization indicates that
the MCa receptor is a skin receptor, while the MCb receptor has a more broad distribution. The duplication of MC

subtypes took place most likely before the divergence of
jawed vertebrates or gnathostomes.

Methods
Cloning and sequencing of melanocortin receptor
fragments from river lamprey and Atlantic hagfish
Degenerate PCR primers were designed from sequence
alignment of all known MC receptors to match highly
conserved receptor regions. Several primer pairs were constructed and two pairs turned out to be effective for amplification of partial sequences from jawless vertebrates: 5'GGCCATCGCCGTCGAYMGNTAYRT-3', 5'-GATCATGTGCAGGAAGAMNGGNVHCCA-3'; and 5'-TAYKTNACIATHTTYTRYGC-3', 5'-AANGCRAADATIARNGGRTG-3' (I
represents inosine, degenerate symbols are IUBMB
codes). Genomic DNA was extracted from liver of river
lamprey and hagfish. About 500 mg of tissue was homogenized in lysis buffer containing 100 mM EDTA, 10 mM
Tris and 1% SDS and centrifuged for 5 min at 11500 g.
The supernatant was extracted with saturated phenol, phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and chloroform. The DNA was precipitated with 1 volume of
isopropanol in the presence of 1 M NH4Ac (10 v/1 v) and
washed with 70% ethanol. Touch-down PCR was performed with Taq polymerase (Fermentas, Lithuania)
under the following conditions: initial denaturation for 5
min at 95 C, followed by 21 cycle of 30 s at 94 C, 45 s at
52-42 C (lowered by 0.5 C per cycle) and 90 s at 72 C. This
was followed by 25 cycles of 30 s at 94 C, 40 s at 50 C and
1 min at 72 C, with a final extension of 5 min at 72 C.

The PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel,
and the products of desired length were cut out from the
gel, purified using the Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Sweden) and cloned into the plasmid vector pCRII from
TOPO cloning kit and transformed into DH5α cells (Invitrogen, Sweden) according to the manufacturers' instructions. The plasmid inserts were sequenced with vectorspecific primers using ABI PRISM Big Dye Terminator
Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit v2.0 and analyzed
by an automated ABI PRISM 310 or ABI PRISM 3100 fluorescent-dye sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Sweden).
Sequences were analysed with Seqman software from
DNAstar package (Lasergene, USA). Sequences were compared against database assemblies with BLASTN and
BLASTX [31].
Screening of river lamprey genomic library and isolation of
full-length genes
Filters from a river lamprey cosmid library in vector
EMBL3 containing approximately 700 000 clones
(roughly three genome equivalents) were obtained from
RZPD (Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum für Genomforschung GmbH, Germany). MC receptor-like fragments were
labelled with 32P using Megaprime Labelling System

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/101

(Amersham Biosciences, Sweden) and used as probes.
Hybridization was performed at 65°C in 25% formamide
(Merck Eurolab AB, Sweden), 6× SSC, 10% dextran sulfate
(Amersham Biosciences), 5× Denhardt's solution, and
0.1% SDS overnight. The filters were washed five times in
0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 1 h. After exposure to
autoradiographic films, two individual cosmid clones
were selected for further characterization. The cosmid cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium in presence of 20 μg/ml kanamycin. Cosmid DNA was isolated
with the Large-Construct kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Already known MC receptor
sequence fragments were used to design sequencing primers. Isolated DNA was sequenced with these primers and
obtained sequence was used to design additional sequencing primers. This strategy was applied until whole MC
receptor gene sequences were obtained. To confirm their
similarity to MC receptor genes, sequences were compared against database assemblies with BLASTN and
BLASTX [31].
Screening of Atlantic hagfish genomic library
Atlantic hagfish lambda GEM-11 genomic library
(Promega, USA) was plated with bacteria host strain.
Approximately, 600 000 plaques were lifted with MSI
nylon transfer membranes (Osmonics Inc., USA) in duplicates and filters were hybridized with 32P-labeled probe as
described above. Filters were exposed to autoradiographic
film (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed.
Alignment and phylogenetic analysis of cloned
melanocortin receptors
Alignment of the predicted full-length amino acid
sequences for the lamprey MCa (341aa) and MCb
(336aa) receptors together with other known MC receptors was generated with ClustalW 1.8 software [32]. The
following receptor sequences (with their accession codes)
were retrieved from GenBank for this analysis: human,

[GenBank:DQ213059], LflMCb [GenBank:DQ213060] and
Atlantic hagfish, Myxine glutinosa, MglMCc [GenBank:DQ213061]. The alignment was bootstrapped 1000
times using SEQBOOT from Phylip 3.6a3 package [33] to
obtain a total of 1000 different alignments. Protein distances were calculated using PROTDIST from Phylip 3.6
a3. The Jones-Taylor-Thornton matrix was used for the
calculation. The trees were calculated from the 1000 different distance matrixes, previously generated with PROTDIST, using NEIGHBOR from Phylip 3.6 a3. As a result
1000 Neighbor-Joining trees were constructed. The bootstrapped consensus Neighbor-Joining tree was obtained
with CONSENSE from Phylip 3.6a3 and plotted using
TreeView 1.6.6 [34]. The partial amino acid sequence of
the hagfish MglMCc (119aa) was aligned with other
known MC receptors and the phylogenetic tree was calculated as described above. The position of the hagfish MCc
receptor and the bootstrap value were added to the tree
containing the lamprey MC receptors.

Expression of receptors
HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) cells with EpsteinBarr nuclear antigen (EBNA) grown to 50–70% confluence were transfected with 10 μg of the construct using
FuGENE-6 Transfection Reagent (Roche, Sweden) according to the manufacturers' instruction. The cells were
grown in Dulbeccos Modified Eagle Media and F-12
Nutrient Mixture (D-MEM/F-12) (1:1) with GlutaMAX I
containing 10% foetal bovine serum, 100 u/ml penicillin,
100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2.5 ug/ml amphotericin B, and
250 μg/ml geneticin G-418 (Invitrogen); in humidified
atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37°C. Semi-stable
cell lines, expressing target receptor, were obtained by
selecting for growth in the presence of 100 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen), first added 24 hours after transfection.

Molecular clock analysis
The full length amino acid sequences of all known
melanocortin receptors from human, mouse, chicken,
zebrafish, dogfish and two sequences from lamprey were
aligned with ClustalW. The constructed alignment in
Phylip format was used to calculate the Neighbor-Joining
tree, as described above. The alignment and the calculated
tree were used as an input files for Tree-Puzzle v5.2 program [35]. The maximum likelihood distances with
molecular clock assumption were calculated with 10 000
puzzling steps, using JTT matrix [36], and mixed model of
rate heterogeneity with 1 invariable and 8 gamma rates,
otherwise default settings were applied. The following
molecular (fossil) data displaying species divergence from
human were applied: human, 0 (0) Myr ago; mouse, 90
(70) Myr ago; chicken, 310 (310) Myr ago; zebrafish, 450
(420) Myr ago; dogfish, 528 (420) Myr ago and lamprey,
564 (525) Myr ago [16]. The corresponding calculated
distances, except for lamprey MC receptors, were plotted
against the molecular and fossil data for each receptor
subtype separately. The linear regression equation was calculated for each receptor subtype. This equation was used
to calculate the distances for lamprey MCa and MCb
receptors for each receptor subtype. These distances were
compared to the tree-puzzle distances for lamprey MCa
and MCb receptors. The closest tree-puzzle distances were
plotted at the corresponding subtype.

The synthesis and purification of lamprey melanocortin
peptides MSH-A, MSH-B and ACTH(1–31)
Sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) MC peptides were synthesized using an automated solid-phase peptide synthesizer (Shimadzu PSSM-8). A series of reactions was
performed according to the manufacturer's instruction as
follows. ACTH(1–31) was synthesized on a TGS-ACFmoc-Asn-resin (30 mg/vessel, capacity 200 μmol/g),
MSH-A was synthesized on a TGS-AC-Fmoc-Phe-resin (31
mg/vessel, capacity 210 μmol/g), and MSH-B was synthesized on a TGS-RAM95%TFA-resin (33 mg/vessel, capacity 200 μmol/g). Fmoc-amino acid [60 μmol for ACTH(1–
31), 65 μmol for MSH-A, and 66 μmol for MSH-B] was
activated with benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris(pyrrolidino)
phosphonium hexafluorophophate [60 μmol for
ACTH(1–31), 65 μmol for MSH-A, and 66 μmol for MSHB] in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole [60 μmol for
ACTH(1–31), 65 μmol for MSH-A, and 66 μmol for MSHB] and N-methylmorpholine [90 μmol for ACTH(1–31),
98 μmol for MSH-A, and 99 μmol for MSH-B] in dimethylformamide (DMF) [210 μl for ACTH(1–31), 228 μl for
MSH-A, and 231 μl for MSH-B] for 30 min. The manipulations in each cycle consisted of (i) deprotection of the
Fmoc group with 30% piperidine/DMF (500 μl, 6 min, 2
times), (ii) washing with DMF (600 μl, 5 times), (iii) coupling of each amino acid in DMF, and (iv) washing with
DMF (600 μl, 5 times). After the completion of all amino

Cloning into pCEP expression vector
Full-length coding sequences of new receptor genes were
amplified by means of PCR from genomic DNA with Pfx
polymerase (Invitrogen) using primers containing HindIII
and XhoI restriction sites at the N and C terminus respectively. Obtained fragments were then digested with both
restriction enzymes and gel purified prior to ligation into
modified pCEP expression vector ([Amp+], [Hygro+];
CMV promoters; SV40 PolyA) [37]. The construct was
sequenced as previously described.

acid couplings, cleavage of the peptides and deprotection
of the side chain were performed in TFA/water/thioanisol/
ethylmethyl sulfide/ethanditiol/thiophenol = 165/10/10/
6/5/4 (v/v) supplemented with 0.5% 2-methylindole (less
than 200 μl) for 6 hr at room temperature. The peptides
were precipitated by the addition of prechilled ether (10
ml) and lyophilized from 0.1% TFA. Peptides were purified by rpHPLC on a TSKgel ODS-120T column (0.46 × 25
cm) with a linear gradient (10 to 70%) of acetonitrile containing 0.1% TFA. The amino acid sequences of the synthetic peptides were confirmed by sequence analysis using
a protein sequencer PPSQ-21A (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan),
and mass spectrometry using an AXIMA-CFR plus mass
spectrometer (Shimadzu).
Radioligand binding assay
HEK-293 EBNA cells expressing MC receptors were harvested from plate and resuspended in binding buffer composed of 25 mM HEPES, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2 and
0.2% bacitracin, pH adjusted to 7.4. To obtain the membranes, cells were mechanically homogenized with Ultra
Turrax. Cell suspensions were centrifuged for 3 min at 190
g and membranes were collected from the supernatant by
centrifugation for 15 min at 20000 g. The pellet was resuspended in binding buffer. The binding was performed in
a final volume of 100 μl for 2 h at room temperature. Saturation experiments were carried out with serial dilutions
of [125I] NDP-MSH { [Nle4, D-Phe7]α-MSH}, labelled by
the Chloramine-T method. Non-specific binding was
determined in the presence of 1 μM unlabeled NDP-MSH.
Competition experiments were performed with constant
0.6 nM concentration of [125I] NDP-MSH and serial dilutions of competing unlabelled human ligands: NDPMSH, α-MSH, β-MSH, γ1-MSH, ACTH (1–17) ACTH (1–
24) ACTH (1–39), MTII, HS024) (Neosystem, France)
and lamprey ligands: MSH-A, MSH-B, ACTH(1–31). The
membranes were collected by filtration on Glass Fibre filters, Filtermat A (Perkin Elmer, USA), using a TOMTEC
Mach III cell harvester (Orange, CT, USA). The filters were
washed with 5 ml per well of 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.4)
and dried at 50°C. MeltiLex A scintillator sheets (Perkin
Elmer, USA) were melted on dried filters and radioactivity
was counted with an automatic Microbeta counter 1450
(Perkin Elmer). Binding assays were performed in duplicate with at least three independent experiments. Nontransfected cells did not show any specific binding with
[125I] NDP-MSH. The results were analysed with Prism 3.0
software package (GraphPad, USA). Binding affinities
were compared with one-way ANOVA Tukey's post-hoc
tests.
cAMP detection assay
Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production
was determined on semi-stable HEK-293 EBNA cells
expressing the target MC receptors. A confluent layer of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/101

cells was incubated for 3 hours with 2.5 μCi/ml of [3H]
ATP (specific activity 29 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). Cells were collected, washed and resuspended
in buffer containing 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.44 mM
KH2PO4, 4.2 mM NaHCO3, 1.2 mM MgCl2 × 6H2O, 20
mM HEPES, 1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM glucose and 0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), pH
adjusted to 7.4. Resuspended cells were incubated at 37°C
for 10 min. Stimulation reaction was performed at 37°C
for 20 min in a final volume of 150 μl containing approximately 2 × 105 cells and various concentrations of lamprey MSH-A, lamprey MSH-B, lamprey ACTH(1–31),
human α-MSH and human ACTH(1–24). After incubation cells were centrifuged and 200 μl of 0.33 M perchloric
acid was added to pellets to lyse the cells. The cells were
frozen, thawed and centrifuged. 200 μl of lysate was
added to Dowex 50W-X4 resin columns (Bio-Rad), previously washed with 2 × 10 ml H2O. As an internal standard, 750 μl 0.33 M perchloric acid containing 0.5 nCi/ml
[14C] cAMP (Amersham Biosciences) was added to each
column. Columns were washed with 2 ml H2O to remove
ATP, which was collected in scintillation vials to estimate
the amount of unconverted [3H] ATP. 4 ml of Ready Safe
scintillation cocktail (Perkin Elmer) was added to the vials
before counting. Dowex columns were then placed over
alumina (Sigma-Aldrich) columns (pre-washed with 8 ml
0.1 M imidazole) and the cAMP was transferred onto the
alumina column using 10 ml H2O. cAMP was eluted from
alumina column with 4 ml 0.1 M imidazole and collected
into scintillation vials to which 7 ml of scintillation fluid
was added. 3H and 14C were counted on Tri-carb liquid
scintillation beta counter. The amount of obtained
[14C]cAMP was expressed as a fraction of total [14C]cAMP
([14C]cAMP/total [14C]cAMP) and was used to estimate
column efficiency in order to standardize [3H]cAMP.
Results were calculated as the percent of total [3H]ATP
(obtained as a sum of [3H]ATP from first column and
[3H]cAMP from second column) to [3H]cAMP and used to
determine EC50 values by non-linear regression using
Prism 3.0 software. All experiments were performed in
duplicate and repeated three times. EC50 values were
compared with one-way ANOVA Tukey's post-hoc tests.
RT-PCR (reverse transcription PCR) and Southern analysis
In order to perform RT-PCR analysis of river lamprey MC
receptors total RNA was isolated from brain and a number
of peripheral tissues: skin, muscle, heart, liver and intestine of river lamprey. Tissues were rapidly dissected from
sacrificed animals within five minutes and immersed in
RNAlater (Ambion, USA) for 24–72 hrs at 4°C before
RNA extraction. Tissues were homogenized on ice and
total RNA was isolated using Rneasy Mini Kit (Qiagen,
USA) including processing with DNA shredder and
DNAse I treatment (Qiagen) as recommended in manufacturer's protocol. Since some of the samples retained

genomic DNA, total RNA was exposed to another treatment with 1 u/μl RNase-free DNaseI (Roche, Sweden) for
10 min, followed by heat inactivation of DNase for 5 min
at 70°C. Absence of genomic DNA in RNA preparations
was confirmed by PCR with primers specific to β-actin
gene using 10–100 ng of total RNA as a template and
genomic DNA as a positive control. Messenger RNA was
reverse transcribed using the 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis kit
(Amersham Biosciences). The produced cDNA was used
as a template for PCR with the specific primers for the
receptor genes. The RT-PCR primers constructed for Lfl
MCa were 5'-CTG CTT CAT CTG CAG CCT GG-3' and 5'TCA CGA CGC ACG CCG CCC ACA-3' (expected product
size 302 bp); primers for Lfl MCb were 5'-AGC ACA AGA
CGA GCA TGC GT-3' and 5'-TGT GGC GCA TCT CGT
GCG AG-3' (expected product size 228 bp). The PCR was
performed with Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) under the
following conditions: initial denaturation for 1 min, 20 s
at 95°C, 30 s at appropriate annealing temperature, 60 s
at 72°C for 30 or 40 cycles and final 5 min at 72°C. The
PCR products were analysed on a 1% agarose gel. DNA
from the gel was transferred onto nylon filters overnight
using 0.4 M NaOH. The filters were hybridized with a random-primed 32P-labelled, receptor specific probe. Probes
were generated with Megaprime DNA labelling kit
RPN1607 (Amersham Biosciences) using sequence verified PCR products amplified from plasmids containing
river lamprey MC receptor genes. Hybridization was carried out at 65°C in 25% formamide, 6× SSC, 10% dextran
sulfate, 5× Denhardt's solution and 0.1% SDS overnight.
The filters were washed three times in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS
for 1 h at 65°C and exposed to autoradiography film
(Amersham Biosciences). Sequence analysis of the PCR
products confirmed the presence of target receptor
sequences. The RT-PCR reactions and hybridization were
performed at least two times each.
