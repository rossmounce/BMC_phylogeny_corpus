Background: Sequence changes in regulatory regions have often been invoked to explain
phenotypic divergence among species, but molecular examples of this have been difficult to obtain.

Results: In this study we identified an anthropoid primate-specific sequence element that
contributed to the regulatory evolution of the low-density lipoprotein receptor. Using a
combination of close and distant species genomic sequence comparisons coupled with in vivo and
in vitro studies, we found that a functional cholesterol-sensing sequence motif arose and was fixed
within a pre-existing enhancer in the common ancestor of anthropoid primates.

To examine the role of cis-regulatory changes in the emergence of novel physiologic traits in primates, we investigated
the evolution of regulatory elements of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene (LDLR), which is a key player in
maintaining lipid homeostasis. Cholesterol metabolism in
humans has diverged in a variety of ways from that of many
distant mammals such as rodents and dogs, with humans in

Since King and Wilson's provocative paper was published in
1975 [1], differences in gene regulatory sequences have been
predicted to be among the major sources of phenotypic evolution and divergence among animals. Consistent with this
hypothesis, cis-regulatory changes have been found to play an
important role in the evolution of morphologic features in
model organisms [2]. In contrast, evolution of physiology has
been linked to changes in protein coding sequences, when
studied in animal vision, digestive metabolism, and host

olism, coupled with its known expression differences among
mammals [11], makes it a prime candidate for investigating
primate-specific evolution of regulatory sequences. Here, we
present molecular data supporting the gain of a cholesterolsensing DNA motif in an ancestral mammalian LDLR regulatory element at a specific stage in primate evolution.

Results and discussion
Identification of primate-specific noncoding elements
in the LDLR locus
To identify putative primate-specific LDLR regulatory
sequences, we examined orthologous regions from a panel of
mammals closely and distantly related to human for the presence of evolutionarily conserved noncoding sequences using

Gumby, an algorithm that detects sequence blocks evolving
significantly more slowly than the local neutral rate (see
Materials and methods, below) [12-14]. Because humans and
nonhuman primates share many features of cholesterol
metabolism, we specifically scanned for elements that are
preferentially conserved in primates under the hypothesis
that primate-specific regulatory sequences contribute to the
distinctive biology of those species. We conducted pair-wise
sequence comparisons of the 83 kilobase (kb) genomic region
containing LDLR and its entire 5' and 3' intergenic regions
between human and each of a panel of distantly related species consisting of the prosimian lemur, mouse, and dog. In
these comparisons we identified either the known promoter
sequence alone (Figure 1a and data not shown) or a limited
number of noncoding elements (Additional data file 1 and

Conservation P values are calculated using Gumby [12] under the null hypothesis of evolution at the neutral (background) rate. Low P values indicate
that the null model of neutrality should be rejected, with the lowest P values identify the most significantly conserved sequences. The sequences
analyzed for human-mammal conservation or enhancer activity correspond to the Gumby predicted conserved sequence and approximately 200
base pairs of flanking sequence on either side (see Materials and methods). Enhancer strength is shown as fold increase over promoter alone in

To explore the regulatory function, if any, of mammalian
sequences orthologous to human PS2, we cloned the PS2aligned sequences from lemur, mouse, and dog into the luciferase reporter vector described above and compared their
activities with that of the human sequence. Despite the lack of
statistically significant sequence constraint between the
human enhancer and its lemur, mouse, and dog orthologs,
the latter three sequences exhibited enhancer activity both in

To explore the potential regulatory function of these two primate-specific conserved elements, we examined their ability
to drive reporter gene expression in both a transient transfection assay in human 293T cells and in an in vivo mouse liver
gene transfer assay [18]. Each human element plus approximately 200 base pairs (bp) of flanking sequence on either side
was cloned upstream of the human LDLR promoter [19] fused
to a luciferase reporter gene. Human element PS2, but not
PS1, consistently increased luciferase expression approximately fivefold relative to the human promoter alone in both
the in vitro and in vivo assays (Figure 2). The human element
PS2 also increased luciferase expression when cloned
upstream of the generic SV40 promoter, albeit to a lesser
extent (twofold; Additional data file 3). Enhancer activity of
this element was further confirmed by the finding that
genomic region corresponding to PS2, but not PS1, is a DNaseI hypersensitive site in human liver cells (Additional data

deposited research

To confirm independently the lack of significant conservation
of the PS1 and PS2 elements between human and distant
mammals, we also analyzed human-mouse alignment using a
sliding-window percentage identity conservation criterion.
We found that the human-mouse percentage identities across
PS1 and PS2 were below 50% (Figure 1 and data not shown).
This is close to the background percentage identity in aligned
intergenic DNA and is well below the threshold of 70% identity that is normally applied to the detection of conserved
functional sequences [16]. We further verified that the phastCons program [17] detects no conserved sequences overlapping PS1 and PS2 (data not shown). Although the phastCons
predictions, obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser, are in
general based on alignment of 17 mammalian and nonmammalian species, conservation scores in the LDLR locus reflect
only mammalian conservation because more distant genomes
exhibit very limited nonexonic alignment in this locus.

three pair-wise comparisons. In contrast, multiple sequence
comparisons between human and a set of five anthropoid primate species, chosen on the basis of their evolutionary relationship using the 'phylogenetic shadowing' strategy [15],
identified two human noncoding DNA elements, named PS
(primate specific) 1 and 2, which were found to be highly significantly conserved (P approximately 10-5) in primates (Figure 1b). However, they were undetected in comparisons
involving human and each of the distant species (Figure 1 and

however, consistently exhibited stronger enhancer activity in
both assays, driving twofold greater expression than lemur or
dog PS2 and fourfold greater expression than mouse (Figure
2a). This observation, coupled with the evidence of negative
selection acting on the primate enhancer and the lack of significant sequence constraint between the anthropoid primate
and mammalian PS2 sequences (conservation P value; Table
1), suggests that the stronger enhancer activity in human is a
gain of function in the anthropoid primate lineage with a
potentially important adaptive role in these species.

t

To identify the molecular basis of the primate-specific activity
of PS2, we computationally dissected the 860 bp human PS2
enhancer (see Materials and methods, below) and found a
sterol regulatory element (SRE). This is a binding site specifically recognized by the cholesterol sensing proteins SREBPs
(sterol regulatory element binding proteins), which are
known to play a key role in the regulation of LDLR [20,21].
Phylogenetic analysis of the orthologous PS2 sequences from
three distant mammals (mouse, rat, and dog), three prosimians (lemur, mouse lemur and galago), and nine anthropoid
primates covering all major lineages including hominoids,
and old-world and new-world monkeys revealed the presence
of the SRE exclusively in anthropoid primates (Figure 3). This
phylogenetic distribution of the SRE in mammals can most
parsimoniously be explained by the appearance of the SRE in
the ancestor of anthropoid primates after its divergence from
prosimians (Figure 3).

luciferase activity in an individual mouse. Red bars denote the median
activity of each construct.

The functional role of the binding motif identified by computational analysis was explored by site-specific mutagenesis. A
4 bp substitution was introduced into the SRE, which was
expected to inactivate the site completely based on a previously reported mutagenesis study [22]. The 4 bp substitution
in the SRE decreased human enhancer activity in the human
cell culture assay and the in vivo mouse liver DNA transfer
assay to a level comparable with that in lemur, mouse, and
dog enhancers; these species lack a computationally predicted SRE (Figure 2). The functionality of the SRE, found
exclusively in anthropoid primates, suggests that this element
is likely to contribute to the stronger activity found in these
species. We also identified within the 860 bp enhancer a 21 bp
subregion that exhibits strong conservation across mammalian species including lemur, mouse lemur, galago, mouse
and dog, and that contains predicted binding sites for transcription factors activating enhancer binding protein (AP)-4
and AP-1. Deletion of the conserved 21 bp sequence from
either human or dog PS2 resulted in a significant reduction in
enhancer activity (data not shown), suggesting that the evolutionarily conserved AP-4 and AP-1 sites are important for the
core enhancer activity shared among mammals. It is worth
noting that such short blocks of genuinely constrained
sequence are not easily distinguishable from the numerous

deposited research

We have shown phylogenetic and molecular data supporting
the evolution of differential gene expression of LDLR in
mammals. Transcriptional control of LDLR is mainly effected
through the intracellular cholesterol sensor SREBP-2. The
latter was previously shown to mediate the increased transcription of LDLR in response to low cholesterol levels
through an SRE in the LDLR promoter [23,30], which is conserved in all mammals examined. The additional SRE found
in the PS2 enhancer in primates may lead to differential
response to SREBP-2 among mammals. Although the contri-

The role of SREBP-2 in regulating the human PS2 enhancer
was further explored in its native chromosomal context in
HepG2 cells, which actively express SREBP-2 and are a well
defined system for studying LDLR regulation [25-27]. Our
analysis showed that the PS2 sequence is a DNaseI hypersensitive site in HepG2 cells (Additional data file 2), suggesting
that the corresponding DNA element is involved in transcriptional regulation of the endogenous gene. Using the ChIP

(chromatin immunoprecipitation) assay, we were able to
show that fractionation of chromatin with an anti-SREBP-2
antibody specifically enriched for endogenous PS2 and LDLR
promoter DNA relative to control region (Figure 5); the latter
has previously been shown to be bound by SREBP-2 [28].
Together, the DNAseI hypersensitivity and ChIP assays provide strong evidence that SREBP-2 binds in the vicinity of the
human PS2 enhancer in its native genomic locus. Regulation
of the enhancer by SREBP-2 also suggests that the PS2 element plays a role in the activation of its upstream gene LDLR
rather than the downstream gene Spbc24, which encodes a
component of the kinetochore Ndc80 protein complex [29]. It
was recently noted, based on genome-wide analysis of gene
expression, that SREBP targets are largely restricted to lipid
metabolism genes, including LDLR [20]. No connection was
found between SREBP and kinetochore structural genes such
as Spbc24.

reviews

Because SREBP-2, the major regulator of LDLR [20,21], specifically binds to the SRE [11], we examined the responsiveness of the human, lemur, mouse, and dog orthologous PS2
enhancers to this transcription factor. Co-transfection of the
reporter gene driven by PS2 and the human LDLR promoter
with a construct expressing the mature form of SREBP-2 indicated that the human enhancer was strongly activated by the
exogenous SREBP-2, to a level fivefold higher than that of the
human LDLR promoter alone, which is known to be SREBP
responsive as well [23]. The lemur, mouse, and dog enhancers
were activated to a significantly lesser extent, which is consistent with their much lower SRE prediction score and with
their lack of additional consensus SRE motifs within the PS2
element (Figure 3, Figure 4a, and data not shown). To determine whether the observed differential SREBP-2 response
among tested mammalian PS2 enhancers was directly mediated by the predicted SRE, we inactivated or restored the consensus SRE by site-specific mutagenesis at the orthologous
positions of the human and dog PS2 element, respectively.
Substituting four bases in the human SRE motif, which
reduced the motif matrix score from 1 to 0.35 (see Materials
and methods, below), resulted in a reduction in SREBP-2
enhancer response to a level comparable to that of the lemur,
mouse, and dog enhancers. These results indicate that the
anthropoid-specific SRE mediates the activation of the PS2
enhancer by SREBP-2 and contributes to the strong enhancer
activity characterizing human and other anthropoid primates. Furthermore, substituting three bases in the dog SRE,
so as to increase the SRE motif score from 0.47 to 1 (representing a perfect SRE), led to a significant increase in the dog
enhancer response to SREBP-2, although only to half the level
of the human PS2 enhancer (Figure 4b). This suggests that
the anthropoid primate-specific SRE is part of a combinatorial mechanism [24], including possible additional substitutions in the core enhancer element that contribute to the
stronger human PS2 enhancer activity.

comment

'coincidentally conserved' sequence fragments that are likely
to occur in large genomic regions as a consequence of stochastic variation in the incidence of neutral mutations. Incorporation of additional information, namely the binding
specificities of transcription factors, was required to classify
this 21 bp fragment as a functional candidate. Thus, conservation of this short subsequence in multiple mammals does not
detract from the fact that the enhancer sequence is significantly conserved only in anthropoid primates, as described
above.

models.
Although the human LDLR coding sequence and promoter
are well conserved in all sequenced mammals (Figure 1 and
Additional data file 1), our data support the modification of
the expression characteristics of this gene through the primate-specific evolution of a distal regulatory element. We
have shown the emergence and fixation of a SRE in the common ancestor of anthropoid primates, which modifies the
expression driven by a pre-existing mammalian enhancer
shared by all tested mammals. This demonstrates one mechanism by which mammalian regulatory elements can evolve
to perform new functions. Given the vital importance of
LDLR in energy storage, the appearance of a new cholesterol
sensing element in the LDLR enhancer might have played a
role in the evolution of new physiologic features, because the
ancestor of anthropoid primates adapted to different metabolic requirements and diets.

The human LDLR promoter was cloned in the proper orientation upstream of the luciferase cDNA in the pGL3Basic construct (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The human PS1
element and the PS2 elements from human, lemur, mouse,
and dog LDLR loci were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
cloned into poly-linker sites in the (-) orientation upstream of
the promoter. The cloned human PS1 element corresponds to
the Gumby predicted conserved sequence and approximately
200 bp of flanking sequence on either side (hg18,
chr19:11067913-11068639). To clone the human PS2 element, the region containing human PS2 was PCR cloned into
pGL3Basic (see Additional data file 4 for primer sequences),
and digested with SpeI and NheI to only include the Gumby
predicted conserved sequence and approximately 200 bp of
flanking sequence on either side (hg18, chr19:1111033311111194). Site-specific point mutations and deletions were
introduced into human and dog PS2 elements using QuikChangeII site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla,

and were confirmed by sequencing. The expression construct

size, homogenized, and centrifuged for 15 min at 4°C, 14,000
rpm. Activities of luciferase and β-galactosidase were measured as described above. All P values are from the two-sample
Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) test using STATA
(STATA Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). All experimental results are representative of two independent plasmid
DNA transfer assays.

Cells of human embryonic kidney cell line 293T (ATCC CRL11268) were grown at 37°C and 5% carbon dioxide CO2 in
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ATCC), supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA), lglutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. Cells with a passage
number below 15 were used. The cells were grown in 12-well
plates (4 × 104 cells/well) and transfected using Fugene
(Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN, USA), in
accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 100 ng
of each assayed plasmid and 10 ng pCMVβ (BD Biosciences,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) were mixed with 1.5 µl Fugene and
added to each well. Following 42-48 hours of incubation, cells
were harvested and lysed. Activity of luciferase and β-galactosidase was measured using the Luciferase Assay System
(Promega) and the Galacto-Light Plus (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA), respectively. Luciferase activity for
each sample was normalized to the β-galactosidase assay control. For co-transfection experiments, 100 ng of the lulciferase reporter gene construct, 3 ng of SREBP-2 expression
vector, and 10 ng of pCMVβ were used. Transfections were
carried out in duplicate. All experiments are representative of
at least three independent transfections.

availability, we included only about 6 kb of the 5' intergenic
region in the analysis. Aligned sequences were scanned for
statistically significant evolutionarily conserved regions using
Gumby [12-14]. Gumby goes through the following three-step
process to identify statistically significant conservation in the
global alignment input. First, noncoding regions in the alignment are used to estimate the local neutral mismatch rates
among all pairs of aligned sequences. The rates are used to
derive a log-likelihood scoring scheme for slow versus neutral
evolution, in which the slow rate is set to some fraction (in
this case, half) of the neutral rate. Second, each alignment
position is then assigned a conservation score using a phylogenetically weighted sum-of-pairs scheme. Third, conserved
regions of any length are identified as alignment blocks with
a high cumulative conservation score and assigned P values
using Karlin-Altschul statistics [36]. We set a threshold P
value of 0.1 in a baseline human sequence length of 10 kb.
Conserved regions identified by Gumby were visualized using
RankVISTA. In addition, human-mouse sequence conservation was analyzed using the VISTA web server [37,38], with
the standard criterion of 70% sequence identity in window of
size 100 bp.

Binding site prediction

1.

We scanned the aligned enhancer sequences for predicted
transcription factor binding sites using DiAlign TF [39].
Anthropoid primate (human, baboon, colobus, dusky titi,
marmoset, and owl monkey) sequences were assessed for the
presence of sites conserved across all six species that were
predicted to bind one of the following liver-expressed transcription factors: C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein), LXR (liver X receptor), FXR (farnesoid X receptor),
COUP-TF (Chicken Ovalbumin Upstream Promoter Transcription Factor), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
(PPAR), HNF1 (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1), HNF3, HNF4,
and SREBP. Binding sites common to primates and mammals
were predicted on the basis of conservation of any vertebrate
transcription factor motif in at least eight of the 10 analyzed
species (six anthropoid primates, lemur, mouse, rat, and
dog). Motif scores of the SREs or SRE orthologs of individual
species were calculated using rVISTA [40] and normalized so
that the maximum achievable score is 1.0, and the expected
score of a random nucleotide sequence with the local GC content is zero. The score distribution of functional SREs was calculated from the binding profile of SREBP [41], assuming that
nucleotide frequencies at each position in the motif are independent. We retrospectively augmented the species set with
SRE orthologs from chimpanzee, rhesus, squirrel monkey,
mouse lemur and galago, based on pair-wise alignments of
those species to human.
