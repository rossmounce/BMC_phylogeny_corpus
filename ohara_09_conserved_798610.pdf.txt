Abstract
Background: In mammals, pheromones play an important role in social and innate reproductive
behavior within species. In rodents, vomeronasal receptor type 1 (V1R), which is specifically
expressed in the vomeronasal organ, is thought to detect pheromones. The V1R gene repertoire
differs dramatically between mammalian species, and the presence of species-specific V1R
subfamilies in mouse and rat suggests that V1R plays a profound role in species-specific recognition
of pheromones. In ruminants, however, the molecular mechanism(s) for pheromone perception is
not well understood. Interestingly, goat male pheromone, which can induce out-of-season
ovulation in anestrous females, causes the same pheromone response in sheep, and vice versa,
suggesting that there may be mechanisms for detecting "inter-species" pheromones among
ruminant species.
Results: We isolated 23 goat and 21 sheep intact V1R genes based on sequence similarity with 32
cow V1R genes in the cow genome database. We found that all of the goat and sheep V1R genes
have orthologs in their cross-species counterparts among these three ruminant species and that
the sequence identity of V1R orthologous pairs among these ruminants is much higher than that of
mouse-rat V1R orthologous pairs. Furthermore, all goat V1Rs examined thus far are expressed not
only in the vomeronasal organ but also in the main olfactory epithelium.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that, compared with rodents, the repertoire of orthologous V1R
genes is remarkably conserved among the ruminants cow, sheep and goat. We predict that these
orthologous V1Rs can detect the same or closely related chemical compound(s) within each
orthologous set/pair. Furthermore, all identified goat V1Rs are expressed in the vomeronasal organ
and the main olfactory epithelium, suggesting that V1R-mediated ligand information can be detected
and processed by both the main and accessory olfactory systems. The fact that ruminant and rodent
V1Rs have distinct features suggests that ruminant and rodent V1Rs have evolved distinct functions.

Background
Pheromones are chemical substances that are secreted
externally by an individual and received by other individuals of the same species, in which they induce a specific
behavior and/or neuroendocrine responses in receiving
individuals [1-4]. In mammals, pheromones are mainly
detected by the vomeronasal organ (VNO) [5-8]. The
vomeronasal receptor type 1 (V1R) [9,10] and V2R [1113] families are specifically expressed in sensory neurons
of the rodent VNO. Both receptor types belong to the
seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor family, but they share no sequence similarity. Thus,
these receptor types are generally considered to have
evolved independently. The deletion of 16 mouse V1R
genes results in altered social behavior and loss of vomeronasal neuron responsiveness to specific pheromones
[14], and V1R (V1Rb2) specifically responds to the mouse
pheromone, 2-heptanone [15]. Collectively, these results
indicate that V1R functions as a pheromone receptor.
Mouse V2R-expressing vomeronasal neurons specifically
recognize exocrine gland-secreting peptide 1 [16]. They
also respond to certain pheromone candidates, such as
major histocompatibility complex ligand peptide [17]
and mouse urinary protein [18]. These results suggest that
V2R also functions as a pheromone receptor.
Putative functional V2R genes are present in mouse, rat,
opossum [19] and platypus [20], but no functional V2R
genes have been reported in dog, cow or human [19]. In
contrast, intact V1R genes have been identified in a variety
of mammals, including mouse, rat, opossum, dog, cow
and human [20-22]. However, the V1R gene repertoire
varies dramatically among different mammals [21,23].
The large and diverse V1R repertoire and species-specific
delineation of certain V1R subfamilies, particularly in
mice and rats [22,24,25], suggests that V1Rs contribute to
species-specific recognition of pheromones and thus have
played certain roles in rodent speciation. However, the
intact V1R repertoire is much smaller in non-rodent mammals, such as cow and dog [21], and the roles of V1Rs in
these animals are not well understood.
In general, pheromones have been thought to have species-specific functions [1]. However, in ruminants such as
goats and sheep, a goat male pheromone, which induces
out-of-season ovulation in anestrous females (known as
the male effect pheromone), also affects sheep, and vice
versa [26,27], indicating that this pheromone functions
across species. Exposure of female sheep to the male effect
pheromone stimulates c-fos expression in both the accessory olfactory bulb and main olfactory bulb [28], raising
the possibility that this pheromone can be detected by
both the VNO and the main olfactory epithelium (MOE).
One goat V1R gene (gV1R1) is expressed in both the VNO
and the MOE, and functional V2Rs have not been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/233

detected in goat [29]. Thus, goat V1R is a good candidate
for detecting this male effect pheromone. Our current
study shows that the V1R gene repertoire is quite conserved among goat, sheep and cow, and thus, all of the
orthologous cow-goat-sheep V1Rs are predicted to detect
the same or closely related chemical compound(s). Furthermore, all identified goat V1R genes were expressed
both in the VNO and the MOE, suggesting that V1R-mediated chemical information is transmitted by the main and
accessory olfactory pathways.

Results
Isolation of the goat and sheep V1R genes
Based on sequence similarity with 32 previously reported
cow V1R genes [21], we identified 23 goat and 21 sheep
V1R genes. Initially, we isolated these V1R genes using
degenerate primers, which were designed based on conserved sequences present in each V1R subfamily among
the various vertebrate species. Unexpectedly, all the
sequences we obtained had high sequence similarity with
the corresponding cow V1R genes. To obtain the complete
coding sequences of the V1R genes, we searched the cow
genome
database
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Genomes/ for flanking nucleotide sequences adjacent to
the coding sequences of each of the cow V1R genes. We
then designed primers (Additional file 1: Primers used to
isolate the coding sequences of goat and sheep V1R
genes.) and isolated the complete sequences of intact goat
and sheep V1R genes from the respective genomic DNAs
by PCR. We obtained a total of 24 intact goat V1R genes,
including one that we previously isolated (gV1R1) [29].
Deduced amino acid sequences of the newly isolated V1Rs
are listed in Additional file 2: Deduced amino acid
sequences of newly isolated goat and sheep V1Rs.
Conserved repertoire of orthologous V1R genes in cow,
goat and sheep
A neighbor-joining tree of intact V1R genes derived from
goat, sheep and other mammalian species [20,21,29,30]
indicates that goat and sheep V1Rs cluster in the A/B/O,
D-F, J/K and L/M/N subfamilies, which fall within previously described cow V1R subfamilies (A/B/O, D-F, J/K, L/
M/N, P, Q) [21]. Figure 1 shows a neighbor-joining tree
for cow, goat and sheep V1Rs. The cow taste type 2 receptors (T2Rs) [31] were used as the outgroup in this tree. All
of the goat and sheep V1Rs have orthologs in cross-species
ruminant counterparts. There were 18 sets of cow-goatsheep, four pairs of cow-goat, one pair of cow-sheep, and
one pair of goat-sheep orthologous V1Rs. Thus, 68.8%
(22 genes) or 59.4% (19 genes) of the 32 cow V1R genes
have orthologs in goat or sheep, respectively (Figure 2).
These percentages are remarkably high compared with
those corresponding to mouse and rat orthologs; only 19
mouse-rat orthologous V1R pairs were found among 191
mouse and 115 rat V1R genes, representing 9.9% of

K, and L/M/N, we detected 2, 8, 15, 5, and 4 bands for
goat, and 2, 8, 15, 4, and 5 for sheep, respectively (Additional file 3B, shown by the arrowheads). We detected a
somewhat larger number of V1R genes in goat and sheep
compared with cow (i.e., for cow: 1, 9, 14, 3 and 3 intact
V1R genes for respective subfamilies above) [21], possibly
a consequence of cross-hybridization of the probes with
pseudogenes in the goat and sheep genomes. Hence, the
approximate size of the repertoire of the intact V1R genes
in goat and sheep might be similar to that in cow. These
data suggest that the orthologous V1R genes exist at significantly higher rates in goat and sheep than in mouse and
rat, although we cannot rule out the possibility that unidentified V1R gene families exist in goat and sheep
genomes.

mouse (19 of 191) and 16.5% of rat (19 of 115) V1R
genes, respectively (Figure 2). Thus, orthologous V1R
genes exist at significantly higher rates in cow than in
mouse and rat.
The complete goat and sheep genomic sequences are not
available at present. Thus, we tried to estimate the approximate size of the goat and sheep V1R gene repertoire by
genomic Southern blot analysis under conditions of low
stringency. Genomic DNAs were digested with the restriction enzymes that do not cut inside the V1R genes, and the
resulting fragments were size fractionated by agarose gel
electrophoresis, transferred to the membranes, and
hybridized with the probes. As probes, we selected one to
three goat V1R genes from each subfamily, which should
detect majority of the genes belonging to each subfamily
under conditions of low stringency. (Additional file 3A:
Genomic southern blot analysis of V1R genes, underlined
V1Rs). We assume that the number of the generated bands
corresponds to that of goat and sheep V1R genes in each
subfamily. In the V1R genes subfamilies A/B/O, D, E/F, J/

Next, we analyzed the identity of V1R orthologous pairs
among goat, sheep and cow. We chose the 22 cow-goat,
19 cow-sheep, and 19 goat-sheep orthologous V1R pairs
that clustered in monophyletic branches (Figure 1). We
calculated and compared amino acid sequence identities
for these pairs with those of the 19 mouse-rat orthologous
V1R pairs (Figure 3). The identity in each set of orthologous pairs ranged from 80.6 to 97.1% for cow-goat, 87.5
to 97.4% for cow-sheep, and 94.2 to 99.1% for goatsheep, whereas the corresponding identity ranged from
71.2 to 88.6% for mouse-rat orthologous V1R pairs. The
average sequence identity was 91.2% for cow-goat, 91.8%
for cow-sheep, and 97.1% for goat-sheep orthologous
V1R pairs, and these values are substantially higher than
the 83.9% for the mouse-rat pairs. These observations suggest that, among ruminants, the orthologous V1R pairs
are quite similar each other at the sequence level.
Expression of V1R genes in the goat VNO and MOE
One goat V1R (gV1R1) is expressed in both the VNO and
the MOE [29,32]. We extracted RNAs from the VNO and
the MOE to analyze the expression of the newly isolated
V1R genes by nested reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR).
We found that all V1R genes were expressed in the VNO
and the MOE (Figure 4A and 4B). Although zone-specific
expression of olfactory receptors has been reported in
rodents [33,34], such a V1R expression pattern was not
observed in goat MOE (data not shown). To obtain a
more precise understanding of V1R gene expression, we
performed in situ hybridization analysis and found that all
V1Rs, except V1R19, are expressed in small subsets of the
cells in the neuroepithelial layer of the MOE as well as in
that of the VNO (Figure 4C and unpublished results)
[29,32]. Because V1R19 was initially detected by RT-PCR
analysis, failure to detect V1R19-expressing cells in the
MOE might reflect the relatively small number of these
cells. Collectively, our results suggest that all goat V1R
genes identified thus far are expressed in both olfactory
organs, the VNO and MOE.

orthologous V1R pairs in mouse and rat (green), cow and
goat (magenta), cow and sheep (yellow), and goat and sheep
(blue) at different levels of amino acid sequence identity is

Discussion
We identified and analyzed goat and sheep V1R genes
(Additional file 2) by comparison with 32 cow V1R genes
in the cow genome database [21]. All the V1R genes we
identified have orthologs in these cross-species ruminant
counterparts (Figure 1). In cow, over 70% (23 of 32) of
V1Rs have orthologs in goat and/or sheep (Figure 1 and
2). This is a surprisingly high percentage because in rodent
only 9.9% of the mouse (19 of 191) and 16.5% of the rat
(19 of 115) V1R genes have an ortholog in their cross-species counterpart. So, species-specific V1Rs, which represent 85-90% of mouse and rat V1Rs, are almost
nonexistent in cow, and "conserved" V1Rs, which have
orthologs among these ruminant species, have been
retained (Figure 2). Thus, cow V1Rs are distinct from the
species-specific V1Rs of rodents [24,25,30]. We speculate
that the role of V1Rs in defining species specificity has
degenerated in ruminants. Alternatively, the function of
defining species specificity may have developed in rodent
V1Rs after the ancestral separation of ruminants from
rodents.
The amino acid sequence identity of cow-goat, cow-sheep
and particularly goat-sheep orthologous V1R pairs (Figure
3) was remarkably high, strongly suggesting that, within
each set/pair, these orthologous V1Rs detect the same or
closely related chemical compound(s). We speculate that
ruminant V1Rs might function to detect compounds that
are evolutionarily conserved and/or commonly essential
for the survival of these species. Therefore, the main function of ruminant V1R might differ from that of rodent
V1R.

Expression of V1R genes in the MOE has been reported in
lower vertebrates, such as fish [35] and frog [36]. However, such expression has been regarded as the exception
in mammals, although V1R expression in the MOE has
been reported in human [37] and goat [29]. Expression of
all 24 goat V1R genes in both the VNO and the MOE (Figure 4) suggests that these V1Rs play a role in chemoreception in the MOE and that V1R-mediated chemical signals
are likely transmitted by two morphologically distinct
pathways. Similar parallel processing of certain pheromone and pheromone candidates in the main and accessory
olfactory systems has been reported in rodents [38-40].
However, it is unlikely that rodent V1Rs are the receptor
for these compounds in the MOE, because functional
expression of V1Rs has not been reported in rodent MOE
[9]. Therefore, analysis of V1R-mediated parallel processing systems in ruminants should provide a profound
understanding of the diverse systems of mammalian
chemoreception.
These features of V1R orthologs in goat and sheep, and the
expression of the V1Rs in the MOE (Figure 4), raise the
possibility that V1R(s) is involved in detecting the male
effect pheromone. The male effect pheromone affects
both goat and sheep [26,27] and seems to be detected by
the MOE [28]. Studies have suggested that volatile chemicals are the candidates for the male effect pheromone
[41,42]. Furthermore, the V2R-mediated signal transduction pathway, which is believed to play a role for pheromone reception in rodents, does not seem to be involved in
the goat pheromone reception system [29,43]. Taken
together, these data suggest that V1R is a very good candidate receptor for the male effect pheromone.
The expression of V1Rs in both olfactory organs, the MOE
and VNO, may indicate the dual system for perceiving the
pheromone information in goat; it appears likely that the
presence of the male effect pheromone is first detected by
MOE V1R, which induces the flehmen response to actively
intake pheromone molecules into the VNO for more precise quantitative analysis with the V1R in it, and if the
amount of pheromone is assessed to exceed a certain
threshold level, the information is then conveyed into
deeper part of the brain, resulting in eventual stimulation
of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulse generator
activity in the hypothalamus. Although studies have
reported that the pulsatile secretory pattern of luteinizing
hormone is accelerated without functional VNO under
certain experimental conditions [44,45], this result does
not preclude the potential importance of the VNO in
mediating the pheromone effect under the natural social
circumstances, where the levels of airborne pheromones
are so subtle that a well-coordinated dual olfactory system
needs to play a vital role in detecting as well as perceiving

them. At present, we cannot rule out the possibility that
other receptor families, such as the olfactory receptor,
might also be involved in recognizing the male effect pheromone in the MOE. Thus, functional identification of the
receptor(s) for the male effect pheromone requires further
study.

Conclusion
The repertoire of V1R orthologs is substantially more conserved among three ruminant species than between
rodent species, raising the possibility that each orthologous ruminant set/pair detects the same or closely related
chemical compounds. These results may explain the
"inter-species" pheromonal effect between goat and
sheep. In goat, all V1Rs identified thus far are expressed in
both the VNO and the MOE, suggesting that in the MOE
these V1Rs play a role in chemoreception and that V1Rmediated chemical signals are likely transmitted by two
morphologically distinct pathways. These features of
ruminant V1Rs seem to be distinct from those of rodent
V1Rs, suggesting that the ruminant V1Rs may have
evolved different functions than rodent V1Rs.

Methods
Animals and tissues
We used adult Shiba goats (Capra hircus) and Corriedale
sheep (Ovis aries) that were maintained in the National
Institute of Livestock and Grassland Science (Tsukuba,
Japan). Goats were sacrificed by an overdose of pentobarbital (30 mg/kg; Dainippon Pharmaceutical Corporation,
Osaka, Japan). The VNO and the MOE were rapidly
removed and used for RNA extraction, or tissues were
fixed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) containing 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4Â°C for histological analysis.
Identification of V1R homologs
Based on the homology of cow V1R genes [21], V1R
homologs were isolated from goat or sheep genomic
DNAs by PCR using the primers listed in the Additional
file 1. Genomic DNAs were obtained from goat liver as
described [29] and sheep blood. To prepare the genomic
DNA from the blood samples, packed blood cells were
mixed with a buffer containing 72 mM NH4Cl and 8 mM
NH4HCO3 for 20 min and centrifuged for 5 min at 4Â°C.
The pellet was washed in the same buffer 2-3 times, dissolved in a buffer containing 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4),
0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 400 mg/ml proteinase K and
0.5% SDS, and incubated overnight at 50Â°C. The DNA
was purified by two cycles of phenol extraction and precipitated with ethanol. The DNA was dissolved in distilled
water and used as a DNA template for PCR. PCR amplification (35 cycles) was carried out at 95Â°C for 1 min, 5560Â°C for 1 min, and 72Â°C for 1 min. Amplified DNA fragments were cloned into a pBluescript SK vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA).

Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
ClustalX version 2.0.5 [46] was used for multiple protein
alignments with manual adjustment. Amino acid
sequence-based phylogenetic trees were reconstructed
using the neighbor-joining method [47] with Poissoncorrected protein distances [48] and were evaluated by
1,000 bootstrap replications. MEGA4 [49] was used to
assess evolutionary relatedness. The identity (%) of the
amino acid sequences of the orthologous V1Rs was calculated using the EMBOSS pairwise alignment algorithms
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/emboss/align/index.html[50].
Identification of orthologous V1R genes
Mouse-rat orthologous V1R genes were identified among
191 mouse and 115 rat V1R genes [30] as described by
Grus and Zhang [24]. Briefly, we identified clades in the
phylogenetic tree that contain a single mouse and a single
rat gene and then calculated the synonymous substitutions per site (dS) between the putative orthologs. Those
with an estimated dS within the range of 0.119-0.316 were
accepted as orthologs. The same method was applied to
cow-goat, cow-sheep, and goat-sheep orthologs. The estimated dS ranges were 0.039-0.147, 0.030-0.119, and
0.014-0.065, respectively.
Southern blot analysis of goat and sheep genomic DNA
Ten micrograms of goat and sheep genomic DNAs were
digested with the restriction enzymes, which do not cut
inside the coding sequences of the V1R genes. The
digested genomic DNAs were size fractionated by agarose
gel electrophoresis, blotted on nylon membrane (Biodyne
Plus, Pall, MI, USA), and hybridized under conditions of
low stringency. The probes were prepared and labeled
with digoxigenin (DIG) using PCR DIG probe synthesis
kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche).
Hybridization was carried out in a solution containing
30% formamide, 7% SDS, 5 Ã SSC, 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine, 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH7.0 and 2% blocking
reagent (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) at 42Â°C overnight,
followed by relaxed washing with 2 Ã SSC containing
0.1% SDS at 55Â°C. Hybridized probes were detected by
using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG Fab
fragment antibody and CDP-Star according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche), and visualized using
LAS4000 IR multi color (Fuji film, Tokyo, Japan).
RT-PCR
Goat total RNAs were extracted from the VNO and the
MOE using PureLink Micro-to-Midi Total RNA Purification System (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and dissolved in
RNase-free water (0.03-0.2 Î¼g/Î¼l). RNA (0.15-1.0 Î¼g) was
treated with DNase in 50 Î¼l reactions containing 50 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM
DTT (Invitrogen), 1 Î¼l RNase inhibitor (Wako, Osaka,
Japan) and 4 Î¼l DNase I (Promega, WI, USA) at 37Â°C for
20 min. The DNA-free RNAs were extracted by phenolPage 7 of 10

chloroform (1:1), precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in
20 Î¼l RNase-free water, and stored at -80Â°C. The cDNAs
were synthesized by SuperScript III (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer's instructions, using purified RNAs as
templates and CTGATCTAGAGGTACCGGATCC (dT)24 as
the primer at 50Â°C for 1 h followed by inactivation of the
enzyme at 70Â°C for 15 min. The cDNAs synthesized without SuperScript III were used as the negative control. To
perform nested PCR, the first PCR amplification (35
cycles) was carried out at 95Â°C for 1 min, 55-60Â°C for 1
min, and 72Â°C for 1 min with the cDNA products as templates. The deoxynucleotide primers used included
CTGATCTAGAGGTACCGGATCC along with those listed
in Additional file 4: Primers used for nested RT-PCR analysis. The second PCR was carried out with the first PCR
product as template with the primers listed in Additional
file 4 at 95Â°C for 1 min, 55-60Â°C for 1 min, and 72Â°C for
1 min (35 cycles). The second PCR products were electrophoresed and visualized using ethidium bromide.
In situ hybridization
Adult goat VNO and MOE were sectioned coronally (6 Î¼m
thick), and sections were hybridized with DIG-labeled
cRNA probes as described [51]. Briefly, sense and antisense DIG-labeled riboprobes were synthesized with a
DIG RNA labeling mix according to the manufacturer's
instructions (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The sections
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 5 min,
immersed in 0.3% H2O2/PBS for 15 min, and treated with
0.5 Î¼g/ml proteinase K/PBS for 10 min. The sections were
then neutralized in 0.2% glycine/PBS for 5 min,
immersed in 0.2 N HCl for 20 min, treated with 0.1 M triethanolamine for 15 min, and washed with PBS for 1 min.
Hybridization was carried out overnight at 55Â°C in a
hybridization solution containing 50% formaldehyde, 1 Ã
Denhardt's solution, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 0.2 mg/ml
yeast tRNA, 0.6 M NaCl, 0.25% SDS, 1 mM EDTA and 10
Î¼g/ml of DIG-labeled cRNA probe. Hybridized sections
were washed in 5 Ã SSC at 50Â°C for 30 min, 50% formaldehyde in 5 Ã SSC at 50Â°C for 30 min, followed by treatment with 2 Î¼g/ml RNase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) at
37Â°C for 30 min. Samples were then washed twice in 2 Ã
SSC at 50Â°C and twice with 0.2 Ã SSC at 50Â°C. After treatment with blocking reagent (Roche) for 30 min, sections
were incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated
anti-DIG Fab fragment (Roche) overnight at 4Â°C. Positive
signals were visualized using 4-nitro blue tetrazolium
chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate
(Roche) as chromogenic substrates.

Genomic southern blot analysis of V1R genes. A: Phylogenetic tree of
intact V1R genes of goat and sheep was reconstructed as described in
Materials and Methods. The V1R genes underlined were used as subfamily-specific probes. B: Goat (lines 1, 3-4, 7-8, 11-12, 15-17) and
sheep (lines 2, 5-6, 9-10, 13-14, 18- 20) genomic DNAs were digested
with EcoRI (lines 1-2 and 7-10), HindIII (lines 3-6 and 11-14) or BglII
(lines 15-20). The digested DNAs were electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose
gels, blotted on nylon membranes, and hybridized with DIG-labeled
probes under conditions of low stringency. Goat V1R1 (lines 1 and 2),
V1R31 (lines 3 and 5), V1R8 (lines 4 and 6), V1R30 (lines 7 and 9)
and V1R19 (lines 8 and 10), V1R10 (lines 11and 13) and V1R9 (lines
12 and 14), V1R14 (lines 15 and 18), V1R4 (lines 16 and 19), and
V1R20 (lines 17 and 20) were used as probes. The hybridized probes were
removed from the membranes (lanes 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 and 18), and
each membrane was re-hybridized with another V1R gene of the same
subfamily (lanes 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 19), respectively. The arrowheads indicate the generated bands.
