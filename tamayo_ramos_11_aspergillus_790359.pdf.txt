analysis and overexpression of laccase-like
encoding genes

Abstract
Background: Many filamentous fungal genomes contain complex groups of multicopper oxidase (MCO) coding
genes that makes them a good source for new laccases with potential biotechnological interest. A bioinformatics
analysis of the Aspergillus niger ATCC 1015 genome resulted in the identification of thirteen MCO genes. Ten of
them were cloned and homologously overexpressed.
Results: A bioinformatic analysis of the A. niger ATCC 1015 genome revealed the presence of 13 MCO genes
belonging to three different subfamilies on the basis of their phylogenetic relationships: ascomycete laccases,
fungal pigment MCOs and fungal ferroxidases. According to in silico amino acid sequence analysis, the putative
genes encoding for functional extracellular laccases (mcoA, mcoB, mcoC, mcoD, mcoE, mcoF, mcoG, mcoI, mcoJ and
mcoM) were placed under the control of the glaA promoter and overexpressed in A. niger N593. Enzyme activity
plate assays with several common laccase substrates showed that all genes are actually expressed and code for
active MCOs. Interestingly, expressed enzymes show different substrate specificities. In addition, optimization of
fungal pigment MCOs extracellular production was investigated. The performance of the widely used glucoamylase
signal sequence (ssGlaA) in McoA secretion was studied. Results obtained suggest that ssGlaA do not yield higher
levels of secreted McoA when compared to its native secretion signal. Also, McoB synthesis was investigated using
different nitrogen sources in minimal medium liquid cultures. Higher yields of extracellular McoB were achieved
with (NH4)2 tartrate.
Conclusions: Aspergillus niger is a good source of new laccases. The different substrate specificity observed in plate
assays makes them interesting to be purified and biochemically compared. The homologous signal sequence of
McoA has been shown to be a good choice for its extracellular overexpression. From the nitrogen sources tested
(NH4)2 tartrate has been found to be the most appropriate for McoB production in A. niger.

Background
Multicopper oxidases (MCOs) form a family of enzymes
that is widely distributed in nature, including laccases
(EC 1.10.3.2), ascorbate oxidases (EC 1.10.3.3), bilirubin
oxidases (EC 1.3.3.5) and ferroxidases (EC 1.16.3.1)
[1,2]. MCOs catalyze the oxidation of a variety of substrates (mainly aromatic compounds and metals) concomitantly with the reduction of molecular oxygen to

water. Their ability to catalyze reactions by producing
just water as the only by-product has increased the
interest of the industry for their use as ‘green’ catalysts,
and their importance is reflected in the broad spectrum
of applications, that range from pulp delignification, textile dye bleaching and water or soil detoxification, to the
formation of pigments, the development of clinical tests
and applications in the field of biosensors, bioreactors,
and biofuel cells [2,3]. Laccases form the biggest subgroup within the MCO family, and due to their broad
substrate specificity they attract the most attention in
studies for biotechnological applications, although other

family members like ascorbate oxidases and bilirubin
oxidases have shown to be promising as biocatalysts for
the industry as well [2,3]. Fungal pigment MCOs are
able to oxidize typical laccase substrates as p-phenylenediamines, pyrogallol, gallic acid or 2,2-azino-di(3-ethylbenzthiazoline) sulfonic acid (ABTS) [4,5], but no
studies about their possible industrial applications have
been reported.
MCO coding genes appear to be redundant in fungal
genomes, probably due to the fact that their coding products may play different physiological roles and they can
be differently regulated depending on environmental
conditions [3,6]. This phenomenon has been described
mostly in basidiomycetes like Coprinopsis cinerea, that
contains 17 laccase sensu stricto coding genes [7] and
Laccaria bicolor with 9 laccase sensu stricto and 2 ferroxidase genes [8]. In ascomycetes MCOs have been
much less studied [9]. Aspergillus nidulans produces YA
[10] and LccD [5], belonging to the fungal pigment
MCO subgroup and the laccases sensu stricto LccB and
LccC [5]. Distinct MCO genes and their coding products have been also characterized in Neurospora crassa,
Aspergillus fumigatus, Myceliophthora thermophila, Melanocarpus albomyces, and more recently in Trichoderma
reesei [11-15]. The production of active laccases has
been reported in many other ascomycetes [16], but no
complete families in fungi from this phylum have been
described so far. Therefore, it is difficult to have an
actual overview about the biotechnological potential of
ascomycete genomes as source for new MCOs. Regarding Aspergillus niger, widely used as an amenable tool
for laccase production together with other cell factories
like Pichia pastoris, T. reesei or Aspergillus oryzae
[17-19], it is remarkable that limited information is
available about its potential as multicopper oxidases
source, whereas various oxidoreductases, including a laccase from black aspergilli, are already being industrially
commercialized (http://www.amfep.org/documents/
Amfep List of Commercial Enzymes - OCT2009 Amfep 09 68.pdf). Only recently, BrnA, a MCO involved
in the conidial pigmentation of A. niger has been
described [20]. The fact that a large number of threedimensional structures of basidiomycete laccases have
been published, whereas only two 3D structures from
the ascomycete laccases sensu stricto of Melanocarpus
albomyces [21] and Thielavia arenaria [9] have been
reported, and no one is available from the fungal pigment MCO subfamily, also indicates the lack of information generated from ascomycete MCOs, particularly
from the latter group, when compared to
basidiomycetes.
In this investigation ten A. niger MCO putative genes
were selected on the basis of their phylogenetic relationships with other multicopper oxidases with reported

laccase activity and homologously expressed from the
glaA promoter. Optimization of the extracellular levels
of fungal pigment MCOs was investigated using different approaches.

Results and discussion
Identification and phylogenetic characterization of A.
niger MCOs

A BLASTp search was made against the A. niger ATCC
1015 genome to identify its complete MCO coding gene
family. The sequences of 38 characterized multicopper
oxidases, from different origin and with different biological roles, were used as query. As a result, 13 gene
models containing the residues proposed to be involved
in copper coordination (Figure 1) –a characteristic signature of all MCOs– were identified (Table 1), including
the recently characterized BrnA [20]. Sequence identities
among the 13 deduced proteins ranged from 21 to 69%
with McoE and McoI having the lowest identity to the
others (35% ≤). McoA, McoB and McoC where at least
52% identical among them, whereas McoD, McoF and
McoG were no less than 50% identical between themselves. In addition McoH and McoK showed the highest
degree of identity (69%). Signal P 3.0 predicted a signal
peptide for all the deduced proteins with the exception
of McoI, suggesting therefore an intracellular localization for the latter. However the SecretomeP 2.0 Server,
a tool designed to predict whether a protein is secreted
via non-classical pathways that has been used repeatedly
in the analysis of fungal sequences [22-25], predicted
that McoI might be an extracellular protein. The
TMHMM Server 2.0 predicted a transmembrane
domain in the C-terminal region of McoH and McoK.
In order to identify those A. niger MCOs that are
more likely to have laccase activity, a phylogenetic analysis was performed to investigate their relationships
with a number of already characterized multicopper oxidases from different origins (Figure 2).

The products of genes mcoA, mcoB and mcoC cluster
with fungal pigment MCOs. This group contains the
enzymes YA from A. nidulans and Abr2p from A. fumigatus, both involved in conidial pigment biosynthesis
and reported to have laccase activity, and TilA, which is
localized at the growing hyphal tip in A. nidulans and
has unknown function [10,15,26].
McoD, McoF, McoG, McoI, McoJ and McoM are in
the cluster that groups the ascomycetous laccases (sensu
stricto) that contains characterized laccases from Botrytis
cinerea [27], N. crassa [14], M. albomyces [13] and A.
nidulans [5] among others.
The MCOs McoH, McoK and BrnA cluster in the
fungal ferroxidase family, that includes the Fet3 and
Fet5 proteins, responsible for the reductive iron assimilation system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [28,29]. This
cluster also harbors the vermelone dehydratase Abr1,
involved (together with Abr2) in the biosynthetic pathway of melanin in A. fumigatus [30,31]. McoH and
McoK are both 49% identical to Fet3 and their coding
genes are clustered with putative iron permease genes
(ftrA and ftrB) whose coding products are 51% and 48%
identical to S. cerevisiae Ftr1 respectively. Fet3 and Ftr1
are responsible of the high affinity iron transport in S.
cerevisiae, therefore a similar function is predicted for
McoH and McoK in A. niger.
McoE belongs to the ferroxidases/laccases subgroup, a
grade of basidiomycete and ascomycete MCOs that
includes Mco1 from Phanerochaete chrysosporium and a
laccase from Cryptococcus neoformans, both of them
with strong ferroxidase and weak laccase activities [1].

The number of MCO coding genes present in A. niger
ATCC 1015 is the highest reported so far in any ascomycete, and higher than those reported in basidiomycetes, with the exception of Coprinopsis cinerea, whose
genome contains 17 MCO coding genes [7,8]. Also, significant genotypic differences have been recently found
between A. niger strains [32]; the genome mining of the
CBS 513.88 strain revealed the presence of 16 MCO
genes (Table 1). Of these, 13 homologous to the ones
present in ATCC 1015 and three additional full-length
coding genes: the ascomycete laccase McoN, similar to
McoI (58% identical) and the fungal pigment MCOs
McoO and McoP, similar to McoA (56% identical) and
McoC (57% identitical) respectively, highlighting even
more the potential of A. niger as an interesting source
for new multicopper oxidases.
Homologous overexpression of A. niger MCO coding
genes with possible biotechnological interest

The analysis of the amino acid sequences and the phylogenetic relationships of the putative A. niger ATCC
1015 MCOs indicates that at least 9 of the 13 coding
genes could code for extracellular enzymes with laccase activity. As mentioned before, laccases have been
reported both in fungal pigment MCO and ascomycete
laccase sensu stricto subgroups, thus all A. niger MCO
genes included in the two subfamilies and predicted to
be extracellular were selected for their homologous
overexpression. The mcoI gene was also selected as it
could be targeted to a non-classical secretory pathway
and its hypothetical coding product is 49% identical to

mcoE from the ferroxidases/laccases grade was
selected, as its coding product is predicted to be an
extracellular enzyme and no similar MCO has been
characterized so far. McoH and McoK have been

predicted to be iron transporters located in the plasma
membrane, therefore both of them were discarded,
whereas BrnA was not selected, as no laccase activity
has been reported for it and its ortolog Abr1 in A.

mcoA-G, mcoI, mcoJ and mcoM were homologously
expressed in the A. niger N593 strain under the control
of the widely used glaA-promoter (glaAp) [34]. Due to
probable ectopic integrations of the plasmids carrying
the MCO genes, different expression efficiencies can
occur. Therefore at least 15 transformants expressing
each gene were tested in plate activity assays for ABTS
and 4-amino-2,6-dibromophenol/3,5-dimethylaniline
(ADBP/DMA) conversion. A significant number of
transformants per gene showed laccase activity against
one or both substrates. As expected, differences were
observed in expression levels for each group of transformants. The additional file 1 in the supplementary material illustrates the screening for McoJ positive
transformants (around 60%) in an ADBP/DMA plate
assay. Different expression levels can be observed: from
no detectable activity to a maximum rate of ADBP/
DMA conversion, reached by several transformants.
When ADBP/DMA was used as a substrate laccase
activity was detected in a significant number of transformants expressing McoA, McoB, McoC, McoD, McoF,
McoG and McoJ. Only strains expressing McoB, McoC,
McoD, McoG and McoJ showed laccase activity towards
ABTS. Clear differences in substrate specificity were
also reported for A. nidulans laccases when ADBP/
DMA and ABTS were used in plate assays [5]. Therefore, in order to have more insight in A. niger MCOs
substrate specificity two more laccase substrates - N, Ndimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate (DMPPDA) and
2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP) - were tested in plate
assays. Again, at least 15 transformants expressing
McoE, McoI and McoM were tested, whereas for the
other MCOs (McoA, McoB, McoC, McoD, McoF,
McoG and McoJ), only the transformant with the higher
activity towards the substrates used previously was
tested in parallel. For these substrates also different patterns of enzyme activity were observed: only McoA,
McoB, McoC, McoD and McoG reacted with DMPPDA,
whereas McoB, McoE, McoF, McoG, McoI and McoM
transformants showed activity when assayed with DMP.
Different degrees of specificity could be observed too
depending on the color intensity of the reaction product: green-blue halo for ADBP/DMA, green halo with
ABTS oxidation, pink halo for DMPPDA and yellow
halo in the case of DMP (Figure 3).
The substrate specificity of A. niger MCOs appeared
not to be correlated to their primary structures, as both
ascomycete laccase sensu stricto and fungal pigment
MCO subgroups include enzymes that were able to oxidize the four substrates: McoB and McoG; enzymes that
clearly reacted with all of them but DMP: McoC and
McoD; and enzymes that only showed activity with two
substrates: McoA (ADBP/DMA and DMPPDA), McoF
(ADBP/DMA and DMP) and McoJ (ADBP/DMA and

reported for other fungal MCOs, they may need other
conditions like: a different concentration of CuSO 4 ,

Optimization of fungal pigment MCOs extracellular
production

Due to the wide range of possible applications of multicopper oxidases many studies are focusing on the
improvement of their production levels and their molecular characterization [36]. Fungal pigment MCOs are
still a far less explored group of copper-containing polyphenol oxidases in comparison to laccases sensu stricto.
Although some of them have been homologous
expressed in A. nidulans, being used as a reporter system [5], no overproduction studies have been described.
In that sense, the performance of the GlaA signal
sequence (ssGlaA), successfully used to improve the
secretion of many proteins, including recombinant laccases [37-39], as well as different culture conditions,
were analyzed in this work.
To investigate the effect of ssGlaA in the production
of extracellular fungal pigment MCOs McoA was chosen as a model enzyme. A. niger transformants ectopically expressing McoA with ssGlaA instead of their
native signal sequence (ssMcoA) were generated, and
their performance compared with McoA producers with
ssMcoA.
Thirty transformants per construct were grown in 96
well culture plates using minimal medium with 50 mM
maltose and 0.1 mM CuSO4. After 24 hours McoA production was quantified using ADBP/DMA as a substrate.
Figure 4 shows the McoA activity of the sixty transformants, expressed in units mg-1 total protein secreted.
The strains based on the ssMcoA resulted to produce
on average higher levels of extracellular McoA in comparison to ssGlaA strains. The best producer carrying
ssMcoA was able to produce 90% more enzyme than
the best one with ssGlaA, whereas the difference in
McoA production between the top five producers from
both conditions was around 70%. This result indicates
that GlaA signal sequence is not more efficient than
ssMcoA in the production of extracellular McoA. However, further experiments should be performed to elucidate whether ssGlaA produces a positive effect in McoB
or McoC extracellular levels.
To investigate the effect of different culture conditions
McoB was used as a reporter. As the effect of a number
of carbon sources in the performance of the GlaA
expression system has been recently deeply investigated

their activity optimally [16,35].
The patterns of activity observed in plate assays for
each A. niger MCO against the different substrates suggest that remarkable biochemical differences exist
between them. Therefore, further studies should be
done with respect to their biochemical characterization
and their possible biotechnological potential.

[40], various organic and inorganic nitrogen sources
were tested in this work. The best McoB producer out
of 15 strains tested in plate assays was grown in 100 mL
of minimal medium with the following nitrogen sources:
urea, NH4CL, casamino acids (CAA), NaNO3 and (NH4)
2 tartrate. Culture supernatant samples were taken 24
and 48 hours after inoculation and McoB production
was quantified using DMPPDA as a substrate. Only
detectable amounts of McoB were measured when
NaNO3 and (NH4)2 tartrate were present in the media.
Additionally, McoB production in cultures with NaNO3
and (NH 4 ) 2 tartrate supplemented with 0.1% of CAA
were also tested (Figure 5). As shown in Figure 5, cultures with (NH4)2 tartrate yielded higher levels of McoB,
independently of the sampling point or the absence/presence of CAA. At 24 hours after inoculation McoB
activity was 8 times higher in (NH4)2 tartrate cultures
when no CAA were added and 13 times higher with
CAA. At 48 hours McoB activity was still 2.7 and 1.8
times higher when (NH4)2 tartrate was used as a substrate, in the absence or presence of CAA respectively.
Therefore (NH4)2 tartrate is the best choice for McoB
production over all nitrogen sources and conditions
tested in this study. Also, in contrast to the positive
effects reported in the A. niger GlaA expression when
the culture medium was supplemented with 0.5% CAA
[41], no clear positive effect was observed in McoB production with a supplement of 0.1% of CAA. On the
other hand, although no high titres of McoB were

achieved in the culture conditions studied, a further
screening of transformants has allowed the isolation of
strains able to produce around 10 times higher levels to
the ones presented in Figure 5 (Tamayo-Ramos et al.,
manuscript in preparation). The use of strategies based
on efforts done so far to boost yields of recombinant
proteins (in particular laccases) [40-44], should result in
new increases of McoB production levels.

Conclusions
The complete family of A. niger MCO coding genes was
identified in the acidogenic wild-type strain ATCC 1015.

Those genes coding for putative extracellular laccaselike MCOs were selected after the analysis of their theoretical coding products primary structure and phylogenetic relationships. After their cloning and
overexpression in A. niger different plate enzyme activity
assays showed that all genes code for active multicopper
oxidases, with apparent different degrees of affinity and
specificity. The use of the A. niger GlaA secretion signal
did not suppose an increase in McoA extracellular production and (NH 4 ) 2 tartrate resulted to be the most
appropriated nitrogen source for McoB synthesis.
Three additional MCO genes were found to be only
present in the enzyme-producing strain CBS 513.88,
confirming the significant genotypic differences between
different A. niger strains and showing the potential of
these ascomycete genomes as a source for new MCOs,
that should be further investigated in order to get more
insights about their possible biotechnological potential
and their biological role.

Methods
Strains and culture media

Escherichia coli DH5a was used for all DNA manipulations. The pyrA deficient strain A. niger N593 was
selected for the PCR amplification and homologous
expression of MCO coding genes. Complete medium
plates were used for spores preparation [45] and minimal medium [45], containing 50 mM of maltose as the
sole carbon source and 0.1 mM of CuSO 4 , was used

Molecular biology techniques and transformation

Standard methods were used for carry out DNA manipulations and E. coli transformations [46]. Genomic DNA
was isolated from A. niger N593 as described previously
[47]. PCR reactions were performed using proof reading
Phusion polymerase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fungal transformations were
made using a similar protocol to the one described in
Oliveira et al. [48].

Cloning A. niger MCO genes

Primers shown in Table 2 were used to amplify A. niger
MCO genes. After their amplification, all genes were
cloned in a pJET vector (Thermo Scientific) and their
sequence verified. Plasmid pALIV (Figure 6), a derivative
of pGW635 [49] carrying the promoter of the glucoamylase coding gene (glaA p ) and the trpC terminator
(trpCt), with pyrA as a selection marker, was used as an
expression vector for the A. niger MCO genes.
By means of a triple-point ligation, 234 nucleotides (nt)
corresponding to the glaA 5’ untranslated region (5’UTR)
(synthesized by DNA 2.0 and provided in the plasmid
pJref) digested with EcoRI-PacI, and the gene mcoA,
obtained from the pJET vector (PacI-NotI), were ligated
and placed under the control of glaAp and trpCt in EcoRI/
NotI digested pALIV, generating the plasmid pGWmcoA
(Figure 6). Plasmids pGWmcoB, pGWmcoC, pGWmcoD,
pGWmcoE, pGWmcoF, pGWmcoG, pGWmcoI,
pGWmcoJ and pGWmcoM were constructed by removing
mcoA from pGWmcoA (PacI-NotI) and ligating the resulting linearized plasmid with PacI/NotI digested mcoB-G,
mcoI, mcoJ and mcoM respectively.
In order to compare the McoA and GlaA signal
sequences, two additional plasmids, pGWssmcoA and
pGWssglaA, were constructed (Figure 7). Synthetic
DNA sequences coding for the first 80 residues (240
nucleotides) of the McoA protein, including the 23 aa of
its predicted signal sequence (ssMcoA), and for 78 residues (234 nucleotides) of a fusion ssGlaA::McoA, with
the glucoamylase signal sequence replacing ssMcoA,
were provided by DNA 2.0 in plasmids pJssMcoA and
pJssGlaA respectively. The glaA 5’ UTR (202 nucleotides) was again synthesized by DNA 2.0, with different
restriction sites adapted to the new cloning strategy, and
provided in the plasmid pJ5ref2. Plasmid pGWmcoA
was digested with EcoRI and BstEII restriction enzymes
and fused in a triple point ligation with glaA 5’UTR

(EcoRI-PciI) and the first 240 nt of mcoA (PciI-BstEII) to
yield pGWssmcoA (Figure 7a). The plasmid pGWssglaA
was generated using the same procedure, through a ligation between the linearized pGWmcoA (EcoRI-BstEII),
glaA 5’UTR (EcoRI-PciI) and the 234 nt fragment coding
for the ssGlaA::McoA fusion (PciI-BstEII) (Figure 7b).
Enzyme activity assays

All enzyme reactions were followed at 23°C. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma and Invitrogen. McoA
activity was quantified measuring the oxidation rate of
the ADBP in a reaction mixture containing 80 μL of
culture supernatant and 20 μL of an ADBP/DMA solution. A 5 mM ADBP solution was prepared in 200 mM
sodium acetate buffer pH 5.0 containing 25% ethanol, in
the presence of 26 mM DMA. The product of the reaction between oxidized ADBP and DMA can be quantified by measuring its absorbance at 600 nm. One unit of

activity was defined as the change of 1.0 in optical density at 600 nm per minute. McoB activity was quantified
in 200 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5.0 measuring the
oxidation rate of 10 mM DMPPDA at 550 nm. One
unit of activity was defined as the change of 1.0 in optical density at 550 nm per minute. The specific activity
of the enzyme was determined after the purification of
the enzyme (Tamayo-Ramos et al., manuscript in
preparation).
The enzyme activity assays in agar plates were performed pouring a solution of either 30 mM DMPPDA,
5 mM ADBP/DMA, 2 mM DMP or 1.4 mM of ABTS in
100 mM NaAc buffer pH 5.0 over A. niger cultures
grown at 30°C for 48 hours. The overlay solutions were
discarded after an incubation time of 5 minutes.
96 well microcultures

Microtiter plates (1.2 ml square-well storage plates,
Thermo Scientific) containing 0.8 ml of minimal

medium were inoculated with 2 × 106 spores/ml, sealed
with gas-permeable adhesive seals (Thermo Scientific)
and incubated at 30°C and 1000 rpm in a microtron
(Infors HT). After 24 hours mycelium was pelleted by
centrifugation during 15 minutes at 2000 g and the
supernatant recovered for laccase activity measurement.
Shake-fask cultures

Erlenmeyer flasks (500 mL volume) containing 100 ml
of minimal medium were inoculated with 1 × 10 6
spores/ml and incubated at 30°C and 250 rpm in an
orbital shaker.

A. niger in silico genome mining was performed using
the BLASTp tool (E value: 1e-3; Matrix: BLOSUM 62;

CBS Prediction Servers were used to predict the subcellular localization of A. niger MCOs. Amino acid
sequences were aligned by ClustalW2 (default options
provided by the program in both the pairwise alignment
and the multiple sequence alignment were used) [54]
from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) toolbox and the phylogenetic tree was constructed with
MEGA4 program [55].
