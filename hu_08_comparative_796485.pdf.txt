Abstract
Background: Genome variability can have a profound influence on the virulence of pathogenic
microbes. The availability of genome sequences for two strains of the AIDS-associated fungal
pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans presented an opportunity to use comparative genome
hybridization (CGH) to examine genome variability between strains of different mating type,
molecular subtype, and ploidy.
Results: Initially, CGH was used to compare the approximately 100 kilobase MATa and MATα
mating-type regions in serotype A and D strains to establish the relationship between the Log2
ratios of hybridization signals and sequence identity. Subsequently, we compared the genomes of
the environmental isolate NIH433 (MATa) and the clinical isolate NIH12 (MATα) with a tiling array
of the genome of the laboratory strain JEC21 derived from these strains. In this case, CGH
identified putative recombination sites and the origins of specific segments of the JEC21 genome.
Similarly, CGH analysis revealed marked variability in the genomes of strains representing the VNI,
VNII, and VNB molecular subtypes of the A serotype, including disomy for chromosome 13 in two
strains. Additionally, CGH identified differences in chromosome content between three strains
with the hybrid AD serotype and revealed that chromosome 1 from the serotype A genome is
preferentially retained in all three strains.
Conclusion: The genomes of serotypes A, D, and AD strains exhibit extensive variation that spans
the range from small differences (such as regions of divergence, deletion, or amplification) to the
unexpected disomy for chromosome 13 in haploid strains and preferential retention of specific
chromosomes in naturally occurring diploids.

Background

The encapsulated, basidiomycetous fungi Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii cause life-threatening meningoencephalitis and pose a significant threat to AIDS patients [1-3].
Four serotypes (A to D) of these fungi are recognized, based
on antigenic differences in the capsule polysaccharide, which
is one of the major virulence factors. C. neoformans isolates
have A or D capsular serotypes and mainly infect immunocompromised individuals [4]. Isolates of serotypes B and C
were recently re-classified as the separate species C. gattii,
which infects both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients [3,5-7]. Strains with hybrid serotypes (AD and
BD) have also been identified from both clinical and environmental sources [8-11]. Serotype A strains are the most prevalent clinical isolates and account for the majority of infections
in AIDS patients. Serotype D isolates account for fewer cases
of cryptococcosis, and some of these infections may actually
involve AD hybrid strains [12]. Serotype D strains are global
in distribution but are more frequently isolated in Europe [2].
The sexual cycle of C. neoformans is well defined and involves
a bipolar mating system with two mating types: a and α [13].
The mating-type locus (MAT) is more than 100 kilobases (kb)
in length and contains more than 20 genes [9,14,15]. Recombination is suppressed within MAT but is elevated in areas
adjacent to the region, and extensive sequence divergence
and rearrangements between the MATa and MATα alleles
have been described [14-16]. The majority of strains isolated
from clinical and environmental sources are of the α mating
type [13], and a serotype D strain of the α mating type is more
virulent in mice than a congenic a strain [17]. In contrast, the
congenic serotype A strains KN99a and KN99α exhibited no
difference in murine virulence, although the latter strain
more efficiently colonizes the central nervous system [12,18].
Further studies revealed that genomic regions outside the
mating-type locus contribute to differences in virulence
between a and α cells [19]. Large-scale genomic comparisons
that may reveal sequences contributing to virulence differences between a and α strains have thus far been limited to
the MAT locus [14,15,20].
Cells of C. neoformans are generally haploid, but it is possible
to obtain relatively stable diploid strains through laboratory
crosses and to identify naturally occurring AD hybrids that
appear to result from the fusion of serotype A and D strains
[9,21-24]. Most of the environmental and clinical AD isolates
are diploid or aneuploid and contain alleles from both the
serotype A and D genotypes [8]. However, recent studies indicate that some AD strains contain only a single mating-type
locus (MATa or MATα), either because of deletion of one
allele or the complete absence of one of the MAT chromosomes [9,25,26]. These observations and the documented
aneuploidy indicate that the genomes of the hybrid strains are
unstable [9]. AD strains can be sterile or self-fertile, and in the
latter case can produce filaments, basidia, and basidiospores
to yield progeny that generally exhibit poor viability [9,25]. In

one instance, the viable progeny from a self-fertile AD hybrid
were found to be either diploid or aneuploid [9].
A number of molecular approaches have been used to investigate the genetic structure and epidemiologic relationships of
Cryptococcus strains [4,8,27-34]. In particular, PCR fingerprinting and amplified fragment length polymorphism
(AFLP) analysis revealed four major molecular types of C.
neoformans [25,29,32,35]: VNI (AFLP1; serotype A), VNII
(AFLP1A; serotype A), VNIII (AFLP3; AD hybrid), and VNIV
(AFLP2; serotype D). Similarly, four molecular subtypes are
found for C. gattii: VGI to VGIV [35], or AFLP groups 4 to 7
[8,32]. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) has also been
used in the phylogenetic analysis of a large number of isolates
of C. neoformans and C. gattii [36-40]. This work provides
insights into the population structure, geographic distribution, and evolutionary history of the species. For example,
Litvintseva and coworkers [38,39] identified a unique group
of serotype A isolates from Botswana (molecular subtype
VNB) that included a significant proportion of fertile strains
with the rare MATa mating type. Interestingly, those investigators went on to show that AD hybrids possessing the rare
MATa allele clustered phylogenetically with serotype A isolates of the VNB subtype from Botswana. In contrast, AD
hybrids with the more common MATα allele clustered with
serotype A isolates of the VNI molecular subtype that is found
globally [40].
The genomes of C. neoformans and C. gattii have been characterized in terms of chromosome content and sequence. By
karyotype analysis, the genome size of different species and
varieties of Cryptococcus is estimated at 15 to 27 megabases
(Mb) and chromosome number varies between 12 and 14
[31,32,41-45]. Loftus and coworkers [46] described the
genome sequences for two serotype D strains, B3501A and
JEC21, and these turned out to be about 19 Mb in size. The
genome sequences of one serotype A strain (C. neoformans
strain H99) and two serotype B strains (C. gattii strains
WM276 and R265) have also been completed.
Comparative genome hybridization (CGH) is a rapid and
cost-effective method to assess the presence, absence, or
divergence of sequences in uncharacterized genomes by comparison with a reference genome. CGH has been applied to
cancer cells, pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria and
fungi, and other organisms [47-52]. In general, CGH circumvents the need to sequence multiple closely related genomes.
For example, comparison of the genomes of two species in the
fungal genus Candida (namely C. albicans and C. dubliniensis) confirmed the relatedness of the two species and identified a group of unique C. albicans genes that may contribute
to virulence [53]. More recent CGH studies in C. albicans
identified genome instability and revealed associations
between aneuploidy, isochromosome formation, and azole
resistance [50,51]. In this study, we used CGH to examine the
genomes of selected strains of the A, D, and AD serotypes

representing all of the molecular subtypes (VNI to VNIV) of C.
neoformans. Specifically, we employed high-density tiling
arrays to identify the global genome differences within and
outside of the mating locus between MATa and MATα
strains, to map putative recombination sites in a genome
resulting from a well characterized genetic cross, to distinguish the molecular subtypes of serotype A strains, and to
identify the origins of chromosomes in selected AD hybrid
strains.

Log2 ratio

CGH signal ratios reflect the similarities or differences
between reference and test genomes, and can detect the
amplification, absence, or divergence of sequences. The CGH
approach was applied to C. neoformans by first designing
high-density tiling arrays of oligonucleotide probes with an
average length and spacing of 50 base pairs (bp) and 44 bp,
respectively, based on the genomes of strains JEC21 (serotype
D) and H99 (serotype A; see Materials and methods, below).
To establish a framework for identifying regions of difference
in Cryptococcus genomes, CGH data collected with the tiling
arrays was initially calibrated by comparing the Log2 ratios of
the fluorescence intensity with the corresponding sequence
identity for previously sequenced mating-type (MAT) regions
of the test and reference genomes (Figure 1). The sequences of
the approximately 100 kb MAT loci of representative serotype
A (H99 and 125.91) and D (JEC21 and JEC20) strains were
available for this analysis [15,46]. The sequences of the MATa
and MATα alleles were obtained from GenBank and the
sequence identities for the coding regions of 20 genes in each
of these loci were plotted against the corresponding Log2
ratios for the hybridization signals of the probes in the genes.
That is, the average of the normalized Log2 ratios from every
eight probes (spanning about 400 bp) covering each of the 20
MAT genes were compared with the corresponding genomic
sequences for the MATa versus MATα alleles. A correlation
was found between sequence identity in the MAT regions and
the Log2 ratios from hybridization signals for each of the
comparisons (r2 = 0.78 for the serotype A strains H99 and
125.91, and r2 = 0.81 for the serotype D strains JEC21 and
JEC20; Figure 1). The Log2 ratios for the hybridization signals ranged from 0.585 to -4.374, and from 0.971 to -4.382 in
MAT regions of the serotype A and D strains, respectively.
Based on these comparisons, Log2 ratios between -3.77 and
0.49 corresponded to sequence identities in the range of
about 75% to 100% (Figure 1). We confirmed that these calibration values held true for randomly selected regions outside
the MAT locus by comparing the identity between seven
sequenced regions and hybridization probes (198 probes)
against the Log2 ratio for those individual probes with the
related strains NIH433 and NIH12 (described below, and
data not shown).

hybridization experiment.

In general, our observed correlations between the Log2 ratio
and sequence identity are similar to CGH results for other
organisms [53-56]. For example, Log2 ratios between -4.0
and 0.5 corresponded to sequence identities (probe/target
identity) between 81% and 100% in Campylobacter jejuni
[56]. Furthermore, CGH data for Chlamydia trachomatis
showed a linear relationship between Log2 ratio and
sequence identity between 75% and 99% [57]. In general, a
Log2 ratio of ±1.0 is used in many CGH experiments to identify divergent (or deleted) and duplicated genes, representing
a conservative threshold for divergent gene detection
[55,56,58]. For our analysis, the observed correlation
between sequence identity and Log2 ratio allowed us to predict whether specific regions in the genomes were divergent,
deleted, and/or amplified. The use of these data for whole
genome comparisons for serotype A, D, and AD strains are
described below.

Comparison of the MATa and MATα genomes of
serotype D progenitor strains
Initially, we used CGH to compare the genomes of two serotype D progenitor strains, NIH433 (MATa) and NIH12
(MATα), with the genome of the derived strain JEC21
(MATα). JEC21 is commonly used in laboratory experiments
and the genome of this strain has the best annotation of the
sequenced cryptococcal genomes [46]. The strain was
obtained from a series of back crosses (starting with NIH433
and NIH12) and was the MATα representative of a congenic
strain pair (with JEC20) used to examine the role of mating
type in virulence [17,59]. NIH433 is an environmental isolate
from pigeon droppings in Denmark, and NIH12 is a clinical
isolate from a patient with osteomyelitis. The cross of NIH12
and NIH433 yielded two F1 strains B3501 (MATα) and B3502
(MATa), and a cross of these strains yielded JEC20 (B-4476)
[17,59]. JEC20 was subsequently used as the parent in a
series of backcrosses to generate JEC21. Thus, approximately
50% of the overall genetic background of JEC21 should be
derived from each of the NIH12 and NIH433 genomes.
Initially, we hybridized the JEC21 array with DNA from the
MATa strain NIH433 to compare the genomes of strains of
opposite mating type. As expected, CGH showed that the
MATa locus was divergent from the MATα locus of JEC21
with Log2 ratios ranging from -5.27 to 1.24 for probes in the
region. However, the analysis revealed an unexpected pattern
of regions with either similar or divergent hybridization signals along 10 of the 14 chromosomes (Figure 2), in addition to
the divergence observed at the MAT locus (Figures 1 and 3).
Interestingly, each of these regions accounted for approximately 50% of the JEC21 genome, with regions of similarity
accounting for about 8.73 Mb (50.6%) and divergent regions
representing about 8.53 Mb (49.4%). Note that the JEC21
array did not contain the centromere sequences (or the rDNA
cluster) and therefore covered about 17.3 Mb of the approximately 19 Mb genome [46] (Additional data file 1). These
regions may represent the segments of the JEC21 genome
originating from either NIH433 or NIH12, and the borders of
the regions are likely to be sites of recombination events that
occurred in the original cross. This idea was tested by hybridizing DNA from the MATα parent NIH12 to the JEC21 array,
and this analysis revealed a reciprocal pattern of similar and
divergent regions as compared with the results with NIH433
(Figure 2). The averages and standard deviations (SDs) of
Log2 ratios of the hybridization intensity of these regions
along all chromosomes were consistent with the visual observations, in which regions of divergence generally have a
higher SD than regions of similarity (Additional data file 1).
This measure of divergence is illustrated quite clearly by signals from the MAT locus. That is, the SD of the MATa locus of
NIH433 is 1.778 (average Log2 ratio of -1.632) upon comparison with the MATα locus of JEC21. In contrast, the SD for the
homologous MATα locus of NIH12 is 0.229 (average Log2
ratio 0.090).

The putative recombination sites were observed in 10 of the
14 chromosomes and the number of these sites ranged from
one on chromosome 7 to seven on chromosome 2 (Figure 2).
Based on the current annotation, these sites occur in both
intragenic and intergenic regions (Additional data file 2).
Chromosomes 10, 11, 13, and 14 did not exhibit variability in
Log2 ratios and different segments could not be distinguished. The SD of the hybridization ratios indicated that all
of chromosome 10 may have originated from strain NIH12,
with little or no contribution from NIH433. On the other
hand, chromosomes 11, 13, and 14 are remarkably similar to
NIH433 but divergent from NIH12, although one of the telomeres on chromosome 14 exhibited variability (Figure 2).
Overall, these findings indicated that CGH with the JEC21 tiling array could detect sequence polymorphisms between
strains of the same serotype and that these could be used to
track recombination history. For C. neoformans and other
fungal pathogens, the detection of recombination sites may
have utility for mapping quantitative traits that contribute to
virulence. Similar approaches have been used to examine
breakpoints in the chromosomes of tumors and to characterize genetic diversity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [47,60].
The CGH analysis also allowed an examination of the MAT
regions of the serotype D strains NIH12 and NIH433 in comparison with that of JEC21. Specifically, we observed that the
flanking regions of the MAT locus on chromosome 4 contained putative sites of recombination presumably from the
cross of NIH12 and NIH433 (Figure 3) [59]. The observed
sites are consistent with the previous identification of regions
flanking the mating locus that are apparent hotspots of
recombination [16]. In agreement, CGH revealed two potential recombination sites in a region of about 6 kb (chromosome 4: 1,525,471 to 1,531,510 and 1,514,930 to 1,520,952), as
well as a third more distant site on the left side, and one site
in a region approximately 27 kb to the right of the MAT locus
(chromosome 4: 1,639,910-1,667,015; Figure 3). Within the
mating-type locus, two divergently transcribed genes, RPO41
and BSP2 (chromosome 4: 1,585,174 to 1,591,759), were presumed to be involved in gene conversion because they are
99% identical between the two mating-type alleles in phylogenetic analyses [15,16]. Consistent with this finding, CGH
yielded a Log2 ratio near zero, indicating high sequence similarity (-0.089 and 0.069 for NIH433 and NIH12, respectively; Figure 3). Three neighboring genes, LPD1, CID1, and
GEF1 (chromosome 4: 1,592,529 to 1,602,117), share similar
properties with RPO41 and BSP2, and Fraser and coworkers
[15] described this area as a species-specific, syntenic region
in the MAT locus.
Examination of the CGH data outside the MAT locus identified several candidate regions of difference between JEC21
and the progenitor strains NIH12 and NIH433. For example,
two regions appeared to be present in single copy in NIH433
but duplicated in NIH12. One of these regions of approximately 20 kb (chromosome coordinates 1,218,400 to

Genome hybridization to compare the progenitor strains NIH12 and NIH433 to the reference strain JEC21. Regions with higher variability in Log2 ratios
in the test genomes are more divergent from the JEC21 sequence; regions with Log2 ratios close to zero have greater similarity (Additional data file 1). A
reciprocal pattern of similar and divergent segments is found upon hybridization of genomes of NIH12 and NIH433 to the JEC21 array. The scale of
chromosome coordinates for the JEC21 genome is indicated at the top of the figure, and gaps in the chromosomes represent putative centromeric regions
[46]. The borders of segments are probable sites of recombination events that occurred during the mating of NIH12 and NIH433, and the subsequent
backcrossing to obtain JEC21 (Additional data file 2) [59].

1,239,200; average Log2 ratio of -0.062 in NIH433 and 0.997
in NIH12) is present on chromosome 3 and contains genes
encoding several putative functions (PM-scl autoantigen,
nicotinate-nucleotide diphosphorylase [carboxylating], phosphate transporter, and kynureninase). The other region of
approximately 13 kb on chromosome 13 (chromosome coordinates 508,400-521,200) encodes putative functions including a metal transporter, a carboxylesterase, a (R, R)butanediol dehydrogenase, and a formaldehyde dehydrogenase (glutathione; average Log2 ratio of 0.016 in NIH433 and
01.284 in NIH12). Additionally, an approximately 29 kb segment near the right telomere of chromosome 5 (encoding
mostly hypothetical proteins) was highly divergent in
NIH433 (average Log2 ratio of -3.232, SD of 1.496) and had
an average Log2 ratio of 0.829 (SD of 0.382) in NIH12 (Figure 2). This region is part of an approximately 40 kb so-called
'identity island' in the genomes of the serotype A and D

strains H99 and JEC21 [61]. The sequences of the region
share 98.5% identity between the two genomes - a level that
is approximately 10% higher than the average identity across
the entire genomes. Kavanaugh and coworkers [61] found
that the approximately 40 kb identity island was the apparent
result of a nonreciprocal transfer event from a serotype A
genome to a serotype D genome about 2 million years ago.
They also surveyed 12 serotype D strains and found that ten
(including NIH12) had the identity island that originated
from the serotype A sequence and that two strains, NIH430
and NIH433, retained the original serotype D version of the
sequence. Therefore, the analysis reported here for NIH12
and NIH433 matches the findings of Kavanaugh and coworkers [61], and thus demonstrates the utility of the CGH
approach for detecting these types of sequence anomalies in
C. neoformans genomes.

annotated genes in the region are indicated as boxes. Putative recombination sites are marked with arrows. Specific genes that are known to have high
sequence similarity between the MATa and MATα alleles [15], and that exhibit a corresponding Log2 ratio close to zero are labelled with letters: a, RPO41
(XM_570485.1; The Institute for Genomic Research [TIGR] locus tag CND05820); b, BSP2 (XM_570482.1; TIGR locus tag CND05830); c, LPD1
(XM_570114.1; TIGR locus tag CND05840); d, CID1 (XM_570548.1; TIGR locus tag CND05850); and e, GEF1 (XM_570546.1; TIGR locus tag
CND05860). The gap in the hybridization signal for NIH12 and NIH433 centered on position 1,610,000 resulted from the presence of repeated sequences
in this region that reduced probe density [15].

NIH433 and NIH12 are both virulent, but NIH433 requires
more time than NIH12 to cause equal mortality when injected
intravenously into mice [59]. In addition to the MAT locus,
differences in genetic background were proposed to be
important contributors to the virulence of these strains [59].
In this context, the differences observed for chromosomes 3,
5, and 13 or undetected polymorphisms (single nucleotide
changes) could potentially influence virulence. For example,
one region on chromosome 3 (2,022,000 to 2,024,000; Log2
ratio -3.161) contains a gene for a predicted O-acetyltransferase (CNC06920) that is deleted in NIH433, as confirmed
by PCR (data not shown). O-acetyl substituents are found on
the polysaccharide capsule that is the major virulence determinant of C. neoformans, and a mutant defective in Oacetylation was found to be hypervirulent [62,63].

Genomic differences between serotype A strains
representing three molecular subtypes
Serotype A strains of C. neoformans are responsible for the
majority of clinical cases of cryptococcosis, particularly in
AIDS patients, and three molecular subtypes (VNI, VNII, and
VNB) have been identified by MLST and AFLP analyses
[2,29,38,39]. Given that CGH detected variation within the
serotype D strains, we next considered whether the same
approach would detect genomic differences in serotype A
strains of opposite mating type and different molecular subtypes. The majority of serotype A isolates have the VNI molecular subtype and the MATα mating type. MATa strains are
rare among clinical and environmental isolates compared
with the prevalence of the MATα mating type. In fact, MATa
strains of serotype A were thought to be extinct or to exist as
a vestigial, nonfunctional form until two clinical strains were

identified: 125.91 from Tanzania [64] and IUM 96-2828 from
Italy [65]. Strain 125.91 (VNI) was found to mate with a subset of MATα serotype A strains, but was unable to mate with
the reference strain H99 [12,64]. Recently, detailed MLST
and AFLP analyses of a large population of serotype A strains
from a global collection identified MATa isolates among the
VNB molecular subtype that is uniquely present in Botswana;
these isolates included strain Bt63, which can mate with H99
[38,39]. With the emerging view of the serotype A population
in mind, we examined the genomes of two MATa strains
(125.91 and Bt63), a VNII strain (WM626 [MATα]), and a
VNI strain (CNB7779 [MATα]) reported to have a small
genome [32]. For this analysis, we employed the tiling array
based on the sequence of the VNI strain H99 and the corresponding chromosome numbers from the genome sequence
assembly [61].
Our analysis of strains 125.91 and Bt63 revealed that, as
expected, the Log2 ratios of hybridization signals in the MAT
locus region were highly variable and ranged from -4.345 to
0.445, and from -4.24 to 0.488, respectively. This indicates
extensive sequence divergence between these MATa regions
and the MATα locus of H99 (Figures 1 and 4, and Additional
data file 3). Note that the MAT locus is on chromosome 5 in
the serotype A strain H99 used for the analysis of the MAT
regions of the serotype A strains 125.91 and Bt63; MAT is on
chromosome 4 in strain JEC21 (serotype D). The average
Log2 ratios were -2.200 (SD 1.319) and -2.204 (SD 1.401) for
125.91 and Bt63, respectively. These results mirror the
comparisons of the MATa and MATα alleles for the serotype

nals between Bt63 and H99 (molecular subtypes VNB and
VNI, respectively) versus 125.91 and H99 (both VNI) suggested that a higher level of genome variability exists
between, versus within, molecular subtypes (Table 1). A large
number of regions of difference were detected for both 125.91
and Bt63 relative to H99 (Additional data files 3 and 4). Several regions were also different between the two MATa
strains. These include the region from 339,600 to 350,000 on
chromosome 1 that appears to be absent from or highly divergent in 125.91 but potentially amplified in Bt63 (Additional
data file 4) and an approximately 1.2 kb deletion (1,443,600
to 1,445,200) on chromosome 3 in Bt63 that was confirmed
by PCR (Log2 ratio of -2.868 in the deleted region; data not
shown). In addition, Bt63 appears to have a duplication of a
region (1,776,000 to 1,786,400) on chromosome 5 that contains genes encoding putative myoinositol transporters. This
observation is interesting because Xue and coworkers [66]
recently showed that inositol stimulates mating in C. neoformans, and it is known that Bt63 mates more robustly with
H99 than does 125.91 [64].
The genome variability between VNI and VNB strains
revealed by CGH prompted us to compare the genome of the
VNII strain WM626 with the H99 genome. VNII strains may
represent up to 20% of the serotype A population worldwide,
and WM626 is a clinical isolate from Sydney, Australia [29].
The results indicated that the WM626 genome is quite divergent from the H99 genome (Figure 4, Table 1, and Additional
data file 3), suggesting considerable variation between the
VNI and VNII subtypes (although a larger survey is needed).
Compared with the results for 125.91 and Bt63, the CGH data
for WM626 revealed a large number of highly divergent or

deleted regions on 12 of the 14 chromosomes relative to the
corresponding locations in Bt63 (Additional data file 4).
We also used CGH to examine the genome content of the clinical strain CBS7779 (VNI) from Argentina that was reported
to have a small genome size as estimated by electrophoretic
karyotype analysis [32]. Specifically, the genome size for
CBS7779 was estimated to be 15 Mb, which is considerably
smaller than the approximately 19 Mb genomes of the
sequenced strains. We initially confirmed the published karyotype of CBS7779 (data not shown), and subsequent CGH
analysis of the genome of this strain with H99 revealed Log2
ratios near zero for all of the chromosomes, suggesting a close
relationship between the two strains (Figure 4 and Table 1).
The similarities in the genomes were particularly evident in
contrast to the results for the hybridizations with Bt63 and
WM626 (Figure 4). These results suggested that CBS7779
shared most, if not all, of its genome with H99, and missing
sequences that would account for the smaller estimated
genome size were not found. This outcome may reflect the
challenge in using electrophoretic karyotyping to measure
genome size, particularly for strains that exhibit chromosome
length polymorphisms that may result in co-migrating chromosomes. It is also possible that the genomes of these strains
may contain different amounts of repetitive DNA. The comparison of the CBS7779 and H99 genomes did reveal a relatively small number of short regions of divergence. Two larger
differences for CBS7779 relative to H99 included an apparent
deleted or divergent region of 17 kb on chromosome 10 and an
amplified region of 20 kb on chromosome 5 (Additional data
file 4).

Variation in chromosomes 1, 5, and 13 for four serotype A strains
Variation in chromosomes 1, 5, and 13 for four serotype A strains. The DNA from the strains was hybridized to the array from the genome of strain H99,
and gaps in the chromosomes represent the positions of repetitive sequences that represent putative centromeres or repeated elements in the MAT locus.
The spikes in the Log2 ratios (for instance, for chromosome 1 of CBS7779) represent individual probes with high Log2 ratios (3 to 4); the sequences of
these probes are present in single copy in the H99 genome but may be part of repetitive sequences in the other strains. For all of the chromosomes in all
four strains, the hybridization data are shown in Additional data file 10, the Log2 ratios are listed in Table 1 and the regions of difference are listed in
Additional data file 3.

The evaluation of the serotype A strains also allowed a more
detailed look at the 'identity island' discussed above. This
region is on the left end of chromosome 5, based the assembled H99 genome sequence, and Kavanaugh and coworkers
[61] found that several genes (The Institute for Genomic
Research [TIGR] IDs: CNE05310, CNE05340, and
CNE05350) in this region were present in H99 and 125.91,
but not Bt63. CGH confirmed these findings and further
revealed that other genes within the region (CNE05250,
CNE05290, CNE05320, CNE05330, CNE05300, and
CNE00020) were present in 125.91 (VNI) but absent in Bt63
(VNB; Additional data file 4). Interestingly, several genes
within the region (CNE05310, CNE05340, CNE05350,
CNE05320, and CNE05330) appeared to be duplicated in
CBS7779 (VNI; Additional data file 4). These genes were also
present in the VNII strain WM626, although a region of about
6 kb on the telomere proximal side appeared to be lost. For
another region of high sequence identity between H99 (chromosome 10) and JEC21 (chromosome 13) [61], CGH revealed
that three consecutive genes, namely CNM02580,
CNM02590 and CNM02600, were conserved in all of the
strains (H99, Bt63, 125.91, and CBS7779). However,
CNM02570, which encodes a putative receptor protein near
to the telomere, was present in H99, Bt63, CBS7779, and
WM626, but not in 125.91. Kavanaugh and coworkers [61]
found that repetitive elements were associated with the identity island on chromosome 5 and suggested that one of these
(Cnl1) may have participated in translocation of the island in
the serotype D strain. It is possible that these elements also
contribute to the variability in these and other regions
observed by CGH.
The CGH analysis also revealed an anomaly in the hybridization signals for chromosome 13 in strains CBS7779 and
WM626, such that the Log2 ratio was above zero (0.562 and
0.721, respectively) across the entire chromosome (Table 1,
Figure 4, and Additional data file 3). The simplest explanation
for this is that chromosome 13 in these strains is present in
more than one copy in some or all of the cells. Alternatively,
duplicated chromosome 13 segments could reside elsewhere
in the genome, but this is less likely, given that the entire
chromosome exhibited an elevated Log2 ratio. Quantitative
real-time PCR with three loci on chromosome 13 in strains
H99, WM626, and CBS7779 supported the conclusion of an
increased copy number in the latter two strains (Additional
data files 5 and 6). Furthermore, replacement of the APT1
gene on chromosome 13 with a neomycin marker confirmed
the presence of two copies of the gene in WM626, compared

with the single copy found upon transformation of strain H99
(Additional data file 7). However, integration at the APT1
gene in strain CBS7779 yielded transformants with only the
neomycin marker replacement of the gene. We hypothesize
that instability at chromosome 13 in this strain may have
resulted in the loss of one copy during the transformation
process (see Additional data file 8). This idea is supported by
quantitative real-time PCR data that confirmed a difference
in copy number for chromosome 13 before and after transformation of the strain (Additional data files 5 and 6). Strains
H99, WM626, and CBS7779 also exhibit phenotypic differences (for instance, in melanin formation) that could potentially result from the difference in chromosome content or the
regions of divergence detected by CGH (Additional data file
9).
Other studies have documented genome anomalies for C.
neoformans, including segmental duplications for serotype D
strains [67] and chromosome length polymorphisms [32,68].
The possibility of elevated copy number for specific chromosomes in C. neoformans suggests that there is potentially
greater genome variability among isolates than was previously appreciated. Chromosome copy number variation may
have implications for differences in phenotypic properties
between isolates. For example, variability in virulence has
been observed for clinical isolates of serotype A and among A,
D, and AD strains [69,70]. Additionally, C. neoformans
exhibits phenotypic switching that influences the expression
of virulence traits, interactions with the host immune system,
the outcome of chronic infection and symptom development
(specifically, intracranial pressure) [71]. It is possible that
switching could result from changes in chromosome copy
number, perhaps through a positive or negative influence on
gene expression. In this regard, Torres and coworkers [72]
recently showed that the gain of extra chromosomes in S. cerevisiae had a major influence on cellular processes, including
gene expression, proliferation, metabolism, and protein
turnover.
Taken together, the CGH data with selected serotype A strains
revealed extensive variability, in agreement with the classification of the strains into different molecular subtypes. Specifically, variation in the Log2 ratios and SDs for each
chromosome supports the grouping of H99 with the other
VNI strains 125.91 and CBS7779 (lower SDs) and indicates
divergence from the VNII strain WM626 and the VNB strain
Bt63 (higher SDs; Table 1). Although we examined a small
number of strains that may not be completely representative,

the variable regions may define signature differences that
could facilitate further characterization of molecular subtypes
and epidemiologic studies. A wide variety of hypothetical
genes and genes with predicted functions were present in the
regions of difference, but no clear pattern of variation was
observed, with the exception that variability was often associated with repetitive elements and/or present at subtelomeric
regions (Additional data file 4). As described above, repeated
sequences such as those associated with mobile genetic elements may contribute to genome instability and examples
have been noted for C. neoformans [61]. For the telomeric
and subtelomeric regions, the observed variability probably
reflects rapid structural evolution of these regions in C. neoformans, similar to that observed at telomeric or subtelomeric regions of S. cerevisiae, A. fumigatus, Magnaporthe
grisea, and many other organisms [47,73-77]. For example,
CGH experiments with the genome of Aspergillus fumigatus
strain Af293 as a reference revealed 2,557 genes that are
absent or diverged in two additional strains of A. fumigatus
and three closely related species, namely A. clavatus, Neosartorya fischeri, and N. fennelliae [75]. These absent or divergent genes exhibited a bias toward subtelomeric locations
[74]. The identification of similar variable segments in C. neoformans may guide future analyses to assess whether genome
variation contributes to the differences in virulence between
serotype A strains [70]. Of course, the approach reported here
would not detect regions that are present in the test genomes
but not in H99.

The chromosome complements of serotype AD hybrid
strains
Clinical and environmental isolates of C. neoformans are normally haploid, and the diploid phase is a transient part of the
sexual phase of the life cycle. Some clinical and environmental isolates possess a hybrid AD serotype and are presumed to
result from natural fusions between A and D parental strains
[78]. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting and PCR analyses
also revealed that AD strains are diploid or aneuploid (>1n
but <2n) [9,26]. We used the tiling arrays for the reference
genomes of H99 (serotype A) and JEC21 (serotype D) to
determine the utility of the CGH approach for characterizing
hybrid strains. Three hybrid strains (KW5, CDC228, and
CDC304) were chosen because they had previously been
characterized with respect to virulence and they exhibited
serotype-specific differences at some loci, including genes at
the MAT locus [9].
Hybridization of DNA from the AD strains to the JEC21 and
H99 arrays suggested that most chromosomes (chromosomes 2 to 4 and 9 to 14 [numbers based on the JEC21
genome]) were represented by copies from both the A and D
genomes because the average Log2 ratios were close to zero
(Figure 5; Additional data file 10). This observation was supported by the finding that other chromosomes of the A and D
genomes were not equally represented in the three AD hybrid
strains (Figure 5 and Additional data file 10). Specifically,

Volume 9, Issue 2, Article R41

Hu et al. R41.10

Log2 ratios for chromosome 1 in the AD strains ranged from
-1 to -4 upon hybridization to the JEC21 array, suggesting the
absence of sequences of chromosome 1 originating from a D
genome, whereas the ratios for hybridization to the H99 array
were 0.5 to 1, suggesting the presence of one or two copies of
chromosome 1 from the parental A genome. Note that the VN
molecular subtype of the parental strains for the hybrids is
not known, and the variation in the Log2 ratios may reflect
sequence divergence between H99 and the serotype A parent.
The average Log2 ratios for each chromosome of the three
strains are listed in Additional data file 10. Overall, the results
indicated that chromosome 1 of KW5, CDC208, and CDC304
originated from an A genome, suggesting that the D genome
version of chromosome 1 may have been lost. Similarly, based
on the Log2 ratios, chromosomes 6 and 7 of KW5 may have
only a serotype A version, chromosome 8 of KW5 appears to
be from a D genome, and chromosome 5 of CDC304 may have
only a serotype D version.
The predictions about the presence of specific chromosomes
were tested by PCR-RFLP analysis of selected regions.
Specifically, tests were performed with chromosome 5 as a
representative chromosome only from serotype D in CDC304
and with chromosome 1 as representative of a chromosome
only from serotype A in all three strains. For comparison,
chromosomes 2 and 3 were included as examples of
chromosomes that were present from both serotype A and D
parents (Figure 5). Initially, PCR-RFLP analysis of a region in
the JEC21 gene CNE04380 on chromosome 5 that was conserved between the A and D genomes confirmed that KW5
and CDC228 have both a serotype A and serotype D copy of
chromosome 5, whereas CD304 only has the serotype D
sequence of this region (Figure 6). Digestion with a different
enzyme confirmed these results and revealed that the serotype A copy in KW5 has a different RFLP pattern from that in
CDC228, most likely due to restriction site polymorphisms.
Parallel PCR-RFLP analyses for chromosomes 2 and 3 confirmed the CGH prediction that the AD hybrids contained
these chromosomes from both the A and D genomes.
Chromosome 1 in the AD hybrids was also examined by PCRRFLP analysis of a segment of the conserved JEC21 gene
CNA01230 (Figure 6). This analysis initially indicated that all
three strains had only a serotype A version of chromosome 1,
although closer examination revealed faint additional bands
from strain CDC304 that could result from incomplete digestion, sequence polymorphisms at the site, or the presence of
the serotype D version of chromosome 1. Restriction digests
with additional enzymes suggested that CDC304 might have
a serotype D version of chromosome 1 present at a low level
(Figure 6). One possibility was that strain CDC304 contained
a mixed population of cells in which the majority had a
serotype A copy of chromosome 1 and a minority also contained a copy from serotype D. To test this hypothesis, we isolated and analyzed four different colonies of CDC304 and
found that the cells in three colonies had only a serotype A

Figure 5
Hybridization analysis of three AD hybrid strains
Hybridization analysis of three AD hybrid strains. The chromosome (chr) numbers listed at the bottom of each panel follow those of the reference
genomes on the tiling arrays; for example, the chromosome numbers from JEC21 are used for the hybridization of DNA from each strain to the JEC21
array. Note that the JEC21 and H99 genomes are largely co-linear, but some of the homologous chromosomes have been assigned different numbers in
the current genome assemblies [61]. Most of the chromosomes of the AD hybrid strains are represented by copies from both A and D genomes.
However, the hybridization signals indicate that chromosome 1 is only represented by sequences from a serotype A genome in all three strains. Similarly,
chromosomes 5, 6, and 7 (and chromosome 14 in KW5) are represented by sequences from only one of the serotypes (either A or D). The average Log2
ratios and standard deviations for all of the chromosomes are listed in Additional data file 6, and PCR-RFLP confirmation for selected chromosomes is
shown in Figure 6.

version of chromosome 1. The other colony contained cells in
which the serotype A and D versions of chromosome 1 were
present in approximately equal abundance (data not shown).
We therefore hypothesize that most cells in strain CDC304
have lost the serotype D copy of chromosome 1, but that a
minor population retains this chromosome. Thus, CDC304
may still be in the process of losing chromosomes from the
original A and D parents, and this observation is consistent
with the genome instability observed for AD hybrid strains
[9].
The AD hybrid strains of Cryptococcus examined in this
study showed that chromosomes of both A and D serotypes
are not equally represented in each AD hybrid strain. That is,
specific chromosomes were represented by sequences from
only one serotype. Although, we have not determined the
copy number for chromosomes that are represented by a single serotype sequence, the possibility exists that these chro-

mosomes are present in two copies because the average Log2
ratios were about 0.4. It is notable that all three AD strains
preferentially contained chromosome 1 sequences from the
serotype A parental strain but not from the D strain. To
strengthen the conclusion that chromosome 1 from serotype
A is preferentially retained in hybrids, we obtained 16 additional AD hybrid strains and examined the origin of chromosome 1 using the RFLP-PCR method (Additional data file 11).
We found that 11 possessed chromosome 1 sequences only
from serotype A and the other five had copies of chromosome
1 from both A and D parents. These results agree with those of
Nakamura and coworkers [79] and Okabayashi and
colleagues [80], who used CAP59 gene sequences from chromosome 1 to examine phylogenetic relationships between
serotypes. They found that the three AD hybrid strains that
they tested grouped with serotype A strains, suggesting that
these strains also had only the serotype A allele of CAP59.
Similarly, Xu and coworkers [24] found evidence for loss of

heterozygosity in AD hybrid strains using MSLT analysis with
four genes and identified strains that cluster with serotype A
strains as well as others that lacked consistent grouping with
one serotype.
The emerging picture of frequent loss of heterozygosity in
hybrid strains and the retention of specific chromosomes
raises questions about the mechanisms of loss and retention.
It is possible that chromosome 1 of serotype A carries a gene
or genes that confer a selective advantage relative to the serotype D version of the chromosome, and/or that the latter
chromosome has a disadvantageous combination of genes. In
this case, hybrids that spontaneously lose chromosome 1 from
serotype A might be at a selective disadvantage. It is also possible that chromosome 1 from the serotype D parent has an
inherent defect in replication or transmission, such that it is
preferentially lost or that incompatibility exists for some
chromosomes. The mechanisms underlying these patterns of
chromosome content, and possible relevance for virulence,
remain to be investigated. It is interesting, however, that the
AD strains are clinical isolates, which raises the possibility
that retention of chromosome 1 from the serotype A genome
(serotype A strains are known to be more virulent) contrib-

utes a selective advantage in the mammalian host
environment.
A set of genes or regions in the AD hybrids have been amplified and compared previously [9]. We examined the CGH
data for these sequences, and the Log2 ratios are consistent
with the interpretations of chromosome content (data not
shown). The three AD strains have also been tested previously
for virulence in comparison with strain H99 [9]. These assays
indicated that the AD hybrids are less virulent than H99 and
differ from each other. Specifically, infected mice succumbed
to H99 by day 25, to KW5 by day 100, and to CDC228 or
CDC304 by day 150. It is known that serotype A strains are
generally more virulent that serotype D strains, although
strain variation exists in both groups [69,70]. Differences in
chromosomal content could potentially influence virulence
through the contributions of specific alleles, such that a
greater content of the A genome (as found in KW5) may result
in enhanced virulence. Of course, other explanations are
possible, including the accumulation of mutations in key virulence traits in the less virulent AD strains and epigenetic
phenomena. Barchiesi and coworkers [69] suggested that the
presence of the serotype A, MATα mating type allele in either

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R41

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/2/R41

Genome Biology 2008,

haploid or diploid (aneuploid) strains is correlated with
virulence, whereas the MATa in serotype A or MATα allele in
serotype D is associated with moderate or no virulence. In
this regard, Lengeler and colleagues [9] showed that KW5 is
heterozygous for the mating-type locus with the serotype D
MATa and the serotype A MATα loci present. In contrast, the
CDC228 and CDC304 strains have the MATα locus from a
serotype D parent and appear to have the MATa locus from a
serotype A parent. Therefore, the contributions of mating
type to virulence are unclear, with contributions likely both
from specific alleles and variable chromosome complements
in the AD hybrids.

Conclusion

The CGH data presented here corroborated the aneuploidy of
AD hybrids and identified preferential chromosome retention
in some strains. Coupled with the discovery of copy number
differences for chromosome 13 in two serotype A strains,
these results identified an unexpected level of genome
variation in C. neoformans. This extensive genome variation
is in contrast to previous reports of extensive clonality in a
large number of isolates representing the environmental population [81]. This may partly reflect one of the advantages of
CGH over AFLP analysis, in that the latter method is typically
unable to identify chromosome or segmental duplication.
Many fungi have a remarkable tolerance to variability in chromosome content, and this may be advantageous for adaptation to different environmental niches. For example,
aneuploidy is common in C. albicans, and aneuploidy and
isochromosome formation can contribute to drug resistance
[50,51]. Additionally, changes in chromosome copy number
can influence virulence [82]. Given these findings, one can
envisage more detailed CGH experiments to determine
whether genome variation contributes to the phenotypic and
virulence differences between strains, mutants, and switch
variants. Variation may also occur during passage through an
animal or during antifungal drug treatment. In combination
with physical mapping [83] and sequencing, CGH will also
allow detailed characterization of emerging strains of clinical
significance and novel populations such as the unusual VNB
isolates that appear to be restricted to Botswana [39]. In this
light, we are also using the sequenced genomes of C. gattii
strains and CGH to investigate genome variability in strains
from the outbreak that is ongoing on Vancouver Island [7,84].
The combined view of genome variability in C. neoformans
and C. gattii may thus provide insights into the mechanisms
of genome microevolution in these pathogens.

The assembled sequences were used by NimbleGen Systems,
Inc. (Madison, WI, USA) [88] to design and manufacture
high-density oligonucleotide genomic arrays. The design for
the arrays was the same for each genome, with oligonucleotide probes that cover all 14 chromosomes for each genome
tiled at an average interval spacing of 44 bp on one strand.
The average length of the probes was 50 bp (range 45 to 85
bp) and the average melting temperature (Tm) of the probes
on each array was 76°C. The number of oligonucleotide
probes for each genome were as follows: 386,279 for H99 and
380,236 for JEC21. The probes for each array were designed
to uniquely match a single sequence in the genome, and
highly repetitive centromeric regions and the rDNA repeat
cluster were not included. In H99, a region of the mating
locus (chromosome 5: 203,813 to 220,976) was considered
repetitive and not included on the array. The comparative
standard operation procedures of NimbleGen Systems, Inc.
were followed for hybridization (42°C), array scanning, and
data acquisition, as described previously [60]. Genomic DNA
from the test strains was labelled with Cy3 and that of reference strains with Cy5. The data were expressed as Log2 ratios
of Cy3/Cy5 fluorescence intensity. The arrays are available
from NimbleGen Systems, Inc.

Data analysis
The data were extracted from scanned array images using
NimbleScan 2.0 software (NimbleGen Systems, Inc.) and
were provided to us as an initial DNA segmentation analysis
of the normalized data. This analysis included a window averaging step, in which the probes that fell into a defined base
pair window size were averaged using the Tukey biweight
mean. The adjacent windows were averaged to reduce the size
of the dataset and the noise in the data. In the present study,
the data were analyzed using 400, 800, and 2,000 bp windows for averaging; these sizes represent 10, 20, and 50 times
the length of an average probe. In most cases, a 400 bp window was used for the analysis. The segmentation of the averaged log2 ratio data was determined based on a circular
binary segmentation algorithm [89]. We also examined the
data for each individual probe in the analyses shown in Figure
1 and Additional data file 4. The sample key for the raw
hybridization data is provided in Additional data file 13 and
the actual data files are available on our website [90].
The CGH results were viewed and analyzed as GFF files with
SignalMap (NimbleGen Systems, Inc.) using 400, 800, and
2,000 bp windows for averaging. The data for the MAT loci
(Figure 1) were analyzed using Log2 ratios from segmentations based on a 400 bp window and the nucleotide sequence
identity for the corresponding region of available homologous
sequences from 20 genes in the loci. The sequences of the
MAT loci were obtained from GenBank, and sequence identity was determined from alignments with the BioEdit

Sequence Alignment Editor [91]. The accession numbers for
the sequences are as follows: serotype A strains H99 (MATα,
AF542529) and 125.91 (MATa, AF542528), and serotype D
strains JEC21 (MATα, AF542531) and JEC20 (MATa,
AF542530). The relationship between Log2 ratio values and
sequence identity was examined by linear regression analysis
in Excel.

Verification of CGH results by PCR amplification and
RFLP analysis
Selected regions identified by CGH as candidates for deleted,
duplicated, or divergent sequences were examined by PCR
amplification and sequence analysis. PCR amplification from
genomic DNA was performed as described by Hu and Kronstad [85], with primers designed from the sequences flanking
each predicted region of difference, so that the amplified fragment spanned the region. The primers were obtained from
Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario, Canada) and their
sequences are listed in Additional data file 14. PCR-amplified
DNA fragments were either sequenced using the dideoxy
chain-termination method or digested with selected restriction enzymes in the case of AD hybrids. Primers for the analysis of AD hybrid strains were designed to target highly
conserved regions in the genome to ensure that the primers
would bind to both the serotype A and D alleles in these
strains. These conserved regions were identified by aligning
the sequences from H99 (representing serotype A) and JEC21
(representing serotype D) with BioEdit [91].
