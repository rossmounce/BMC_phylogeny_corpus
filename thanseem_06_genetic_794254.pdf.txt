Abstract
Background: India is a country with enormous social and cultural diversity due to its positioning
on the crossroads of many historic and pre-historic human migrations. The hierarchical caste
system in the Hindu society dominates the social structure of the Indian populations. The origin of
the caste system in India is a matter of debate with many linguists and anthropologists suggesting
that it began with the arrival of Indo-European speakers from Central Asia about 3500 years ago.
Previous genetic studies based on Indian populations failed to achieve a consensus in this regard.
We analysed the Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA of three tribal populations of southern
India, compared the results with available data from the Indian subcontinent and tried to
reconstruct the evolutionary history of Indian caste and tribal populations.
Results: No significant difference was observed in the mitochondrial DNA between Indian tribal
and caste populations, except for the presence of a higher frequency of west Eurasian-specific
haplogroups in the higher castes, mostly in the north western part of India. On the other hand, the
study of the Indian Y lineages revealed distinct distribution patterns among caste and tribal
populations. The paternal lineages of Indian lower castes showed significantly closer affinity to the
tribal populations than to the upper castes. The frequencies of deep-rooted Y haplogroups such as
M89, M52, and M95 were higher in the lower castes and tribes, compared to the upper castes.
Conclusion: The present study suggests that the vast majority (>98%) of the Indian maternal gene
pool, consisting of Indio-European and Dravidian speakers, is genetically more or less uniform.
Invasions after the late Pleistocene settlement might have been mostly male-mediated. However,
Y-SNP data provides compelling genetic evidence for a tribal origin of the lower caste populations
in the subcontinent. Lower caste groups might have originated with the hierarchical divisions that
arose within the tribal groups with the spread of Neolithic agriculturalists, much earlier than the
arrival of Aryan speakers. The Indo-Europeans established themselves as upper castes among this
already developed caste-like class structure within the tribes.

Background
"Out-of-Africa" hypothesis suggests that the anatomically
modern humans originated in Africa about 160,000 –
150,000 years ago, and then spread outward, completely
replacing the local archaic hominid populations outside
Africa. India has served as a major corridor for the dispersal of modern humans out of Africa, owing to the positioning of the Indian Peninsula at the crossroads of Africa,
the Pacific and the West and East Eurasia. The enormous
cultural, linguistic and genetic diversity of the more than
one billion people living in the contemporary ethnic
India can be attributed to this. The Indian society and culture might have been affected by multiple waves of migration and gene flow that occurred in the historic and prehistoric times [1]. The first among this is the ancient Paleolithic migration by the modern humans during their initial colonization of Eurasia. This is followed by the early
Neolithic migration, probably of proto-Dravidian speakers, from the eastern horn of the Fertile Crescent. The
Indo-European speakers, who might have arrived ~3,500
years ago, are the third potential source of Indian gene
pool. The Austro-Asiatic and Tibeto-Burman speakers
with ties to East/Southeast Asia form the fourth major
contributors. The most recent conquerors from Central
Asia and the colonizers from Europe might also have
added to this ethnic multiplicity.
The social structure of the Indian population is dominated by the hierarchical Hindu caste system. There are
4,635 well-defined endogamous populations in India,
which are culturally stratified as tribes and non-tribes. The
532 tribal communities, who are supposed to be the aboriginal inhabitants of the sub-continent, constitute 7.76%
of the total population (Indian Census – 2001). The origin of caste system in India is a matter of debate. Previous
genetic studies on Indian castes and tribes failed to
achieve a consensus on Indian origins and affinities. A few
studies reported closer affinity of Indian castes with either
the Europeans or the Asians. Studies of Bamshad et al [2]
and Basu et al [3]support the genetic differentiation of
caste and tribal populations, and the North Indian invasion of Indo-European speaking nomads, pushing the
Dravidian tribes to southern peninsula. On the other
hand, Kivisild et al [4] suggest that Indian tribal and caste
populations derived largely from the same genetic heritage of Pleistocene southern and western Asians, receiving
limited gene flow from external regions since Holocene.
Further, Cordaux et al [5] reports that the paternal lineages of Indian castes are more closely related to the Central Asians than to the Indian tribal groups, thereby
supporting the view that Indian caste groups are primarily
the descendents of the Indo-European migrants. More
studies are required for a better understanding of the
genetic structure of the diverse Indian populations, where
many questions remain unanswered. In the present study,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/7/42

mtDNA and Y chromosome of three different tribal populations of Andhra Pradesh (AP), South India, were analyzed. On comparing the results with available data, we
were able to reconstruct the evolutionay history of Indian
caste and tribal populations, by providing a comprehensive picture of their genetic structure.

Results and discussion
Mitochondrial DNA variation
The sequence data corresponding to nucleotide positions
15927 – 16550 [revised Cambridge Reference Sequence
(rCRS)] [6] that includes the HVR I region was obtained
from 347 individuals belonging to the three tribal populations. Insertions were observed at two positions
(16169_16170insC, 16262_16263insT). Nucleotide substitutions were observed at 120 sites, defining 149 HVR I
motifs. Seventy haplotypes were observed among Pardhan, 53 among Naikpod and 48 among Andh tribes. A
total of 131 (76.5%) unique haplotypes were observed;
56 (80%) in Pardhan, 37 (70%) in Naikpod and 38
(79%) in Andh. Only two HVR I motifs were found to be
shared among all the three populations; 10 haplotypes
were shared between Pardhan and Naikpod, four between
Pardhan and Andh and six between Naikpod and Andh.
At the individual level, 43% of haplotypes were shared by
two or more individuals, 75% of this being within the
same population.
Demographic expansion of the populations
Based on AMOVA, the variation among studied populations was only 2.1%, while the remaining 97.9% variation
was within populations. The number of haplotypes, haplotype diversity, nucleotide diversity, mean number of
mismatches, Fu's Fs statistic values, raggedness index (r),
expansion ages and initial effective population sizes of the
three populations are summarized in Table 1. The demographic history of each population was examined by computing the pairwise difference distributions. Unimodel
distribution curves were observed, which could be interpreted as signs of demographic expansion. Likewise, the
raggedness index was found to be less than 0.02 in all the
populations studied; values of r lower than 0.05 also suggest demographic expansions [7]. Negative values of Fs
that differ significantly from zero, and the significant (P <
0.05) negative D values, further support a recent expansion.
Mitochondrial haplogroups
The frequencies of various mtDNA haplogroups in the
three tribal populations are summarized in Table 2; a total
of 27 different haplogroups were observed [see Additional
file 2]. Of the 347 sequences, 67% belongs to the haplogroup M and its subclades. This is consistent with the previous studies, suggesting the frequency of M in the Indian
tribal groups is more than that in caste populations [8].

M3, which is defined by the motif 482-16126, was the
most frequent sub-clad, and it accounted for 17% of the
total M lineages. This was followed by M2 (15%) and
other undefined M lineages (16%). Other Indian-specific
M-clades like M6, was found in fairly good frequencies in
the Pardhan tribe (17% of M); M25 constituted 9.5% of
the total M lineages in Naikpods. A relatively high frequency of M18 (13% of M and 8.3% of the total), defined
by the transversion at 16318, was observed in Pardhan,
while it was absent in the other two populations.
The newly defined Indian-specific mitochondrial subclad, M41 [9], was found in ~5% of the Pardhan M samples. This lineage was previously reported as an undefined

M lineage found at a very low frequency in caste (Brahmin, Yadava and Mala) and tribal (Koya and Lambadi)
populations of AP, but not anywhere else in India
[4,10,11].
Macrohaplogroup N constituted 33% of the studied samples, and vast majority of them belonged to Indian-specific variants of the phylogenetic node R, including
haplogroups R5, R6 and U2. The most frequent sub-clade
of R was R5 (35% of total R), followed by U2 (25%). A
new package for the Indian-specific mtDNA clades has
been proposed by Metspalu et al [8] which includes deeprooted lineages of M2, R5 and U2, since these constitute
nearly 15% of the Indian mtDNAs, and being virtually
absent in Eurasia. In the present study, this Indian package harbors 28.5% of all samples, much more than the
Indian average; this is a genetic testimony for their ancient
origins.
Median joining networks were constructed, showing the
distribution of various "limbs" and "boughs" of the M
and R "trunks", and a star-like topology (Figure 1). These
star-like clusters reflect the demographic expansion of the
studied populations.
Genetic uniformity of Indian maternal lineages
The present HVR I data from the three populations,
together with the 10 previously reported data from South
Indian tribal populations, were compared with that of
caste populations published before [4,8,12,10,13] (Table
3). AMOVA revealed that the tribal populations showed a
variation of 6.38 % among themselves. Variation between
the tribal groups and lower castes was found to be only
0.5%. A higher diversity was observed (0.93%) between
the tribal populations and upper castes. Significant difference was not observed when the upper caste populations
were split according to their linguistic affiliation. Difference between upper and lower castes was also found to be
very low (0.46%).

Roychoudhury et al [14] had suggested that Indian populations were founded by a rather small number of females,
possibly arriving on one of the early waves of out-of-Africa
migration of modern humans; ethnic differentiation
occurred subsequently, through demographic expansions

and geographic dispersal. Lack of L3 mitochondrial lineages other than M and N in India, and in non-African
mtDNAs in general, suggest that these earliest migrants
might have already carried these two mtDNA ancestors
[9]. The coalescence time of Indian M lineages was found
to be older than that of most of the East Asian and Melanesian M clusters [15]. These results suggest that the
Indian subcontinent was settled soon after the initial outof-Africa expedition, and that there had been no complete
extinction or replacement of the initial settlers [9]; rather
it might have been restructured in situ by the major demographic episodes of the past, and by the relatively minor
gene flow due to the recent invasions from both the West
and the East [8]. In view of the stringent mating practices
imposed by the caste system in India, our present study
strongly suggests a common maternal ancestry, rather
than an extensive recent gene flow between the caste and
tribal populations. However, the presence of western Eurasian-specific mtDNA haplogroups like HV, TJ and N1 in
comparatively higher frequencies among upper castes, is
suggestive of recent maternal gene flow. They are likely to
represent a relatively low-intensity, long-lasting admixture at the western border regions, as well as migrations
during the last 1000 years before present (ybp) [11].

Y SNP analysis- relationship of lower castes with the tribes
A Y-chromosomal haplogroup tree, based on 16 biallelic
markers, of 250 male samples from the three tribal populations was constructed. The haplogroup frequencies
observed, and their background average variance of 6 YSTR (short tandem repeat) loci are shown in Figure 2.

AMOVA analysis revealed 2.77% variation among the
three tribal populations studied. They showed 2.18% variation, when compared with the 8 South Indian tribal
populations studied earlier. When Andh samples were
omitted from the analysis, the other two populations
showed more closeness to the other Indian tribes, with
1.72% variation. Interestingly, the variation between the
studied tribal populations and 13 Indian caste populations (Table 4) was only 1.14%. When all the available
data were combined (11 tribes and 13 castes) the variance
between the groups became 2.85% (north-east Indian
tribal data omitted). This is a remarkably lower value than
the earlier report of Cordaux et al [13], where they found
13% variation between the Indian tribal and caste groups.
In this study, however, we omitted populations with samples size less than 20, and those for which all biallelic polymorphisms were not typed. A total of 508 tribal and 901

caste samples were included in the analysis; this forms the
broadest dataset of Indian Y chromosomes, so far [see
Additional file 1].
The frequencies of major Y-SNP haplogroups in the different Indian populations are given in Table 4. The most frequent haplogroup among the Indian upper castes belongs
to R lineages (R*, R1 and R2); together, these account for
44% of the upper caste Y-chromosomes. Haplogroup H
was the most frequent Y lineage in both the lower castes
and tribal populations, with frequencies of 0.25 and 0.30,
respectively. The Indian Y-SNP tree (Figure 3) shows that
the distribution pattern of the major Y lineages is similar
in tribal and lower caste populations, and is distinct from
the upper castes.

Although many other nations are known for social discrimination, perhaps, nowhere else in the world has inequality been so elaborately deep rooted as in the Indian
institution of caste, even though it has undergone significant changes since independence. An interesting observation in the present study is that the available Y-SNP data
from 374 individuals belonging to five lower caste populations from different geographic regions with various linguistic affiliations, show only 1% variation with the South
Indian Dravidian tribal groups. The lower caste shows
more similarity with the tribal groups than with the upper
caste populations (4.72% difference between the upper
and lower castes). This is suggestive of a tribal origin for
the Indian lower castes. Geography does not seem to have
affected this association of the tribal groups with the

lower castes, since there was no significant difference in
the AMOVA value when the lower castes were grouped as
northern and southern, based on their geographic locations. At the same time, significant variation (6.17%) was
observed between upper castes and tribal groups (Table
5). However, variation of Dravidian tribal groups with
Dravidian higher castes was found to be lower (4.4%)
than that with Indo-European speaking north Indian
higher castes (8.1%). The Indian lower castes that constitute around 68% of the total population are more paternally related with the tribal community, who are believed
to be the original inhabitants of the subcontinent, following the initial settlement during late Pleistocene.
The Y-SNP markers that are likely to have an Indian origin
[F* (M89), H (M52), and O (M95)], as suggested earlier
[5], were found in high frequency (Table 4), both in the
tribes and in the lower castes. Around 89% of the samples

with these clads belongs to either the tribes or the lower
castes. Previously, it was reported that M52 should not be
considered a tribal marker, as its frequency is concentrated
regionally around AP [4]. However, in our study of 250
tribal samples from AP, its frequency was 0.25, while for
112 samples from two lower caste populations from Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand, the frequency was found to
be 0.36. Hence, it is a lower caste/tribal marker, rather
than a tribal marker alone, and is widely distributed. The
origin of M52 within the subcontinent, immediately after
late Pleistocene settlement, cannot be ruled out, since it is
the major Y lineage of more than 85% of the hierarchical
Hindu caste system, and spread throughout the country
except the North East. Limited presence of this clad in
Central Asia and in European gypsy populations [16] may
be due to the recent back migrations, and there are several
theories about their Indian ancestry [17]. However, the
relatively low STR variance of H haplogroup in compari-

tribes. A high frequency of M95 is also expected from the
Indian Austro-Asiatic speaking populations, like their
Southeast Asian counterparts, who were hypothesized to
be the earliest settlers of the Indian sub-continent [19]. Of
the two major groups of Austro-Asiatic tribes in the Indian
subcontinent, the Mundari speakers are proposed to be
non-Asian/African in origin, who arrived in the subcontinent taking a southern coastal route [20]. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the higher frequency of M95 in
South Indian tribal populations is the footprints of these
initial settlers, who already carried the defining mutation,
and later spread to Southeast Asia. The higher STR variance observed among the M95 samples of the present
study also supports their early settlement in the Indian
sub-continent. Interestingly, the TMRCA (time to most
recent common ancestory) of the Southeast Asian M95 is
estimated to be only ~8000 years, with a star of population expansion ~4,400 years ago [18].
The Neolithic contributions
The J172 clad was observed in about 10% of the Indian
populations, with almost half of them belonging to upper
castes; its frequency was much lower among the tribes
(0.06) and lower castes (0.07). The macrohaplogroup J is
proposed to have arisen in the Levant, and perhaps, associated with the spread of Neolithic culture. However,
more archeological, linguistic and genetic evidences are
necessary to hypothesize that M172 is a part of 'Neolithic
genes' that invaded the Indian subcontinent with Dravidian agriculturalists, since we observed very high STR diversity for J haplogroup in the Dravidian tribal populations.

Distribution of major Y-SNP haplogroups among the tribal,
lower caste and upper caste populations of India.

Frequency of haplogroup L- (M11/M20), which is also
proposed to be associated with the expansion of farming,
was 13.7%, with the highest occurrences in caste populations. A similar frequency of L lineage has previously been
reported from Pakistan [21]. An M27 mutation that
defined the subclad L1 was found in all the L-M11 samples in the present study. This is in accordance with the
previous studies that M27 characterizes the Indian and
Pakistani lineages, which is absent in their Turkish counterparts [22]. This result, together with the differences in
STR nodal haplotypes of the L clad between the Caucasus
and Indian populations [4], and matches in the six STR

son with the other Indian haplogroups (Figure 2) is
slightly unexpected, and may need further investigations
with additional markers and samples.
M 95- genetic footprints of earliest settlers?
The M95 lineage (O2) is a predominantly Southeast Asian
haplogroup among the Austro Asiatic speakers [18]. In
our analysis, M95 mutation was detected in 6.3% of the
Indian samples with highest frequency in lower castes and

loci typed between Turkish and Armenians [22], lead to
the assumption that the Indian and Pakistani L lineages
might have originated from a distinct founder population.
This view is supported by the much lower STR variance of
the L haplogroups compared with the other Indian Y-lineages, observed in the present study.
Preexistence of R lineages in the subcontinent
The sister clads; R1a1 (M17) and R2 (M124) of the M207
lineage together form the largest Y haplogroup lineage in
India, with a frequency of 0.32. They are present in substantial frequencies throughout the subcontinent, irrespective of the regional and linguistic barriers. The
haplogroup R-M17 also has a wide geographic distribution in Europe, West Asia and the Middle East, with highest frequencies in Eastern European populations [23]. It is
proposed to be originated in the Eurasian Steppes, north
of the Black and Caspian seas, in a population of the Kurgan culture known for the domestication of horse, ~3500
ybp [23], and widely been regarded as a marker for the
male-mediated Indo-Aryan invasion of Indian subcontinent. However, these observations were contradicted by
the higher STR variations observed in the Indian M17 and
M124 samples, compared with the European and Central
Asian populations, suggesting a much deeper time depth
for the origin of the Indian M17 lineages. In the present
study, it was observed that the R lineages were successfully
penetrated to high frequencies (0.26) in the South Indian
tribal populations, a testimony for its arrival in the peninsula much before the recent migrations of Indo-European
pastoralists from Central Asia. In a recent study, Sengupta
et al [24] observed higher microsatellite variance, and
clustering together of Indian M17 lineages compared with
the Middle East and Europe. They proposed that it is an
early invasion of M17 during the Holocene expansion
that contributed to the tribal gene pool in India, than a
recent gene flow from Indo-European nomads. However,
we found that its frequency is much higher in upper castes
(0.44) compared to that of the lower caste (0.22) and
tribal groups (0.26). This uneven distribution pattern
shows that the recent immigrations from Central Asia also
contributed undoubtedly to a pre-existing gene pool.
Lower castes: uplifted tribal groups?
The origin of the caste system in India remains an enigma,
although several theories suggested that it began with the
arrival of Aryans [25]. However, many linguistics and
anthropologists argue that caste system prevailed in India
even before the entry of Aryan speakers [26]. Many castes
are known to have tribal origins, as evidenced from various totemic features that manifest themselves in these
caste groups [27]. The caste system might have developed
as a class structure from within the tribes, with the spread
of Neolithic agriculturalists as suggested by Majumder
[28]. Kosambi [27] also pointed out that the knowledge

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/7/42

and ownership of the means of food production might
have created hierarchical divisions within the tribal societies. The origin of present day lower castes should be
traced back to this period, rather than the recent Aryan
migrations and admixture. Molecular data from the
present study can be considered as a genetic testimony in
support of these viewpoints on the origin of caste system
in India.

Conclusion
Our study suggests that the vast majority (>98%) of the
Indian maternal gene pool that consists of the Dravidian
and Indo-European speakers is genetically more similar,
and received only minor gene flow with the recent invasions from both the West and the East, since their initial
late Pleistocene settlement. On the other hand, the Indian
Y-chromosome lineages show obvious difference in their
distribution pattern among the tribal and caste populations. However, the lower castes, (backward classes and
scheduled castes, as per the Indian Constitution) show
striking similarity with the Indian tribal populations.
These groups, which constitute more than 85% of the
hierarchical Hindu caste system, have the indigenous
M52, M95 and M89, as their major Y lineages. This result
suggests that the Indian lower castes are genetically more
associated with the tribal populations, than to the higher
castes, an evocative of their tribal origins. The presence of
these native haplogroups in the Indo-European nomads,
who arrived ~3500 ybp and established themselves as
upper castes, might be due to the recent admixture with
the local populations. The presence of the so called west/
central Asian lineages like J2, R1 and R2 in most of the
endogamous tribal populations, and its higher STR diversity indicates its presence in the sub-continent much
before the arrival of the Indo-European pastoralists. In
short, the impact of their arrival in the Indian sub-continent is rather social and political, than genetic.

Methods
DNA isolation
About 10 ml of blood samples from healthy unrelated
individuals belonging to three tribal populations namely
Pardhan (n = 193), Naikpod (88) and Andh (66) were
collected from the northwestern region of Adilabad district of AP, southern India with their informed written
consent with the help of the Tribal Welfare Department,
Government of AP. DNA was isolated from the samples
using the standard protocol [29].
Amplification of mitochondrial DNA
The hyper-variable regions (HVR I and HVR II) and
selected coding regions of the mtDNA were amplified
from 10 ng of template DNA using 10 pM of each primer,
100 μM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 1 U of Taq DNA
polymerase. Generally, 35 cycles of reaction was per-

formed with 30 sec denaturation at 94°C, 1 min annealing at 58°C and 2 min extension at 72°C. Annealing
temperature and time were slightly modified for few sets
of primers. The reactions were carried out in MJ Research
thermal cycler (PTC-200).
Y-chromosomal markers
Sixteen Y-chromosome biallelic polymorphic markers viz
M89, M216, M9, M45, M82, M69, M170, M172, M11,
M175, M95, M122, M207, M173, M17, and M124 were
typed to construct the Y-chromosome phylogeny of the
studied populations according to Y- Chromosome Consortium nomenclature [30]. The PCR cycles were set-up
with an initial denaturation of 5 min at 95°C, followed by
30–35 cycles of 30 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at the primer-specific annealing temperature (52 – 60°C), and 45 sec. at
72°C, and final extension of 7 min at 72°C. Length variations at 6 Y-STR loci, DYS19, DYS389-1, DYS389-2,
DYS390, DYS391 and DYS393, were typed using previously published primer sequences [31]. The multiplex
PCR amplifications were performed in reaction volumes
of 10.0 μl with 1U of AmpliTaq Gold® DNA polymerase
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 10 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 250 μm dNTPs, 3.0
μm of each primer (forward primers are fluorescently
labeled), and 10 ng of DNA template. Thermal cycling
conditions were as follows: (1) 95°C for 10 min, (2) 28
cycles: 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min,
(3) 60°C for 45 min, and (4) 25°C hold. The PCR amplicons along with GS500 LIZ size standard were analyzed
using the ABI 3730 DNA Analyser (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). The raw data were analyzed using the
GeneMapper v3.7 software program (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA).
Sequencing of the PCR products
PCR products were directly sequenced using BigDye™ Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) in ABI
Prism 3730 DNA Analyzer following manufacture's protocol. The individual mtDNA sequences were judged
against the rCRS [6] using AutoAssembler – ver 2.1
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). The sequences
were aligned using CLUSTAL X [32,33], and mutation
data were scored with MEGA ver 3.1 [34,35]. Mitochondrial haplogroups were assigned to all samples according
to Sun et al [36] and Thangaraj et al [9].
Phylogenetic and statistical analyses
Data analyses for mtDNA sequences and Y-SNPs were performed using the ARLEQUIN software package [37,38].
Haplotype- and nucleotide- diversity and their standard
deviations (SD); mismatch distributions, mean pairwise
differences and their SD; Fu's Fs statistics [39] and associated P-values based on 1000 stimulated samples, raggedness index 'r', Fst distances between pairs of populations

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/7/42

and associated P-values based on 1000 permutations and
Tajima's D value [40] were calculated. Analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) were performed to evaluate the
genetic structure of the populations; the significance of
variance components tested with 10,000 permutations.
Other statistical inferences, including initial theta (θa) and
values of tau (τ) were used to calculate effective population size (Ne = θa/2μ) and population expansion age (Y=
A xτ/2μ) [41]. An average mutation rate μ = 0.00124 per
site per generation with an average generation time A = 20
years, was used for calculation. Median joining networks
[42] were constructed with the help of Network 4.112
program [43] with default settings. Haplotype diversity
and STR variance were calculated according to Kivisild et
al [4].
