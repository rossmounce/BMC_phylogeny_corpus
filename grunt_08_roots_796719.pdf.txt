Abstract
Background: Shuffling of modular protein domains is an important source of evolutionary
innovation. Formins are a family of actin-organizing proteins that share a conserved FH2 domain
but their overall domain architecture differs dramatically between opisthokonts (metazoans and
fungi) and plants. We performed a phylogenomic analysis of formins in most eukaryotic kingdoms,
aiming to reconstruct an evolutionary scenario that may have produced the current diversity of
domain combinations with focus on the origin of the angiosperm formin architectures.
Results: The Rho GTPase-binding domain (GBD/FH3) reported from opisthokont and
Dictyostelium formins was found in all lineages except plants, suggesting its ancestral character.
Instead, mosses and vascular plants possess the two formin classes known from angiosperms:
membrane-anchored Class I formins and Class II formins carrying a PTEN-like domain. PTENrelated domains were found also in stramenopile formins, where they have been probably acquired
independently rather than by horizontal transfer, following a burst of domain rearrangements in
the chromalveolate lineage. A novel RhoGAP-related domain was identified in some algal, moss and
lycophyte (but not angiosperm) formins that define a specific branch (Class III) of the formin family.
Conclusion: We propose a scenario where formins underwent multiple domain rearrangements
in several eukaryotic lineages, especially plants and chromalveolates. In plants this replaced GBD/
FH3 by a probably inactive RhoGAP-like domain, preserving a formin-mediated association
between (membrane-anchored) Rho GTPases and the actin cytoskeleton. Subsequent amplification
of formin genes, possibly coincident with the expansion of plants to dry land, was followed by
acquisition of alternative membrane attachment mechanisms present in extant Class I and Class II
formins, allowing later loss of the RhoGAP-like domain-containing formins in angiosperms.

Background
Domain shuffling in modular proteins is considered one
of the major sources of evolutionary innovation [1]. Phylogenetic studies of signaling and regulatory proteins
exhibiting variable domain composition can provide

important contributions towards understanding the basis
of the current diversity of life.
Formins (or FH2 domain-containing proteins) may serve
as a good example of an ancient protein family with a
likely role in morphogenesis (at least on the cellular level)

whose evolution included extensive domain rearrangements. The well-conserved FH2 (formin homology 2)
domain [Smart: SM00498, Interpro: IPR015425, Pfam:
PF02181] can nucleate new actin filaments by a unique
„leaky barbed-end cap“ mechanism, and in some situations acts as a capping protein (for a review see [2,3]).
Besides FH2, most formins possess a N-terminally located
proline-rich region (termed the FH1 domain), implicated
in interactions with the actin monomer-binding protein
profilin. Some formins also share additional („optional“)
domains that vary substantially between diverse eukaryotic lineages.
Metazoan formins often contain a N-terminal GTPase
binding domain (GBD, [Pfam: Drf_GBD]) interacting
with Rho class GTPases. GBD usually overlaps with
another conserved domain, FH3 [Pfam: Drf_FH3], and
the GBD/FH3 motif is recognized by a C-terminally
located autoinhibitory domain (DAD – Diaphanous
autoregulatory domain, [Pfam: Drf_DAD]). This domain
architecture, which is believed to mediate control of the
formin's actin-nucleating activity by Rho-related GTPases
[4], was originally considered characteristic for metazoan
diaphanous-related formins but later found to be widespread, though not ubiquitous, not only in metazoans,
but also in fungi and Dictyostelium [5].
FH2-containing proteins tend to form extensive families
of paralogs (mouse, e.g., has at least 15 formin-encoding
genes that can be assigned to 7 conserved classes [6]), and
their overall domain organization is often variable within
the repertoire encoded by any given genome. Nevertheless, certain domain arrangements are more frequent,
present in multiple species of a given taxon, and therefore
probably ancestral. This is apparently also the case of the
GBD/FH3-FH1-FH2-DAD architecture.
However, no GBD/FH3-containing formins have been
identified in plants so far. Formins from angiosperms can
be unequivocally assigned to one out of two classes, based
on primary structure of their FH2 domains [7,8]; none of
them is orthologous to any of the proposed seven metazoan formin classes [6], or to fungal formins.
Each angiosperm formin class exhibits also a characteristic
domain composition. The „prototype“ structure for plant
Class I formins includes a N-terminal membrane insertion signal, followed by a supposedly extracytoplasmic
Pro-rich stretch, a transmembrane region, and C-terminal
FH1 and FH2 domains [9]. Experimental studies confirmed membrane association for several Class I formins
in Arabidopsis and suggested within-class functional differences reflected e.g. in varying tissue- or organ-specific
expression patterns or in protein localization to specific
subcellular destinations [10-15]. A novel mode of interac-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/115

tion with actin has been documented for a Class I member, AtFH1 from Arabidopsis, which can induce formation
of filament bundles in addition to formin nucleation [16].
Angiosperm Class II formins usually (though not always)
carry a N-terminal domain related to members of another
conserved protein family whose founding member is the
human antioncogene PTEN, recently implied also in the
pathogenesis of the Parkinson disease (reviewed in [17]).
The conventional PTEN domain exhibits a phosphatase
activity towards both lipids and proteins and is believed
to mediate lipid-based signaling affecting e.g. actin organization, cytokinesis and development of cell surface structures in organisms as diverse as the human, Drosophila and
Dictyostelium [18-21]. Surprisingly, the phosphatase catalytic site is eroded by mutations in the PTEN-like domains
of plant formins, suggesting that this domain may perhaps participate in localization of the FH2 domain rather
than exhibiting its own catalytic activity [8].
PTEN-related domains are found also in metazoan tensin
(a multifunctional protein involved in integrin-mediated
focal adhesions and in cell motility, which can also crosslink actin filaments and cap their barbed ends [22-24]),
auxilins (proteins participating in uncoating of clathrincoated vesicles) and in the auxilin-like domain of the cyclin G-associated protein kinase [22,25], indicating that
the PTEN domain is, like FH2, a versatile building block
capable of entering into multiple contexts.
It is therefore not surprising that PTEN family proteins
without any obvious relationship to the formins have
been found also in plants. Arabidopsis has three PTEN
homologues, one of them (AtPTEN1) essential for the
male gametophyte development [26]; the phenotype of
the non-viable mutant pollen suggests an involvement in
cell surface organization.
Systematic phylogenetic studies of the formin repertoire
encoded by complete genomes have been so far restricted
on one hand to the opisthokont lineage (Metazoa and
Fungi) and the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum
[5,6] which may be relatively close to opisthokonts [27],
or, on the other hand, to vascular plants, predominantly
angiosperms [7,8]. Thus, until now, we could not decide
whether any of the opisthokont (or plant) formin architectures represents either a conserved ancestral state or a
late invention. Using the growing thesaurus of publicly
available sequence data, we have attempted to map the
formin diversity across five out of the six major eukaryotic
kingdoms (sensu [27]), with particular attention to plants.
The results yielded a possible evolutionary scenario that
may have produced the extant domain architecture of
plant formins, and provided interesting insights into the

general.

Results
A collection of eukaryotic formin sequences
To obtain a broader view of the formin diversity, we
scanned 36 available complete or nearly complete eukaryotic genome sequences, as well as EST and cDNA databases of additional eleven species, using known
representatives of plant Class I and Class II, metazoan and
yeast formins as queries (see Materials and Methods). As
a result, we have assembled a collection of 122 plant
formin sequences from 16 species (including selected
non-seed plants), as well as 173 formins from 31 species
of the metazoans, fungi, amoebae, chromalveolates and
excavates (see Additional file 1 for a full list of species and
genes and Additional file 2 for newly predicted or revised
protein sequences). As expected, all complete genomes
studied encoded at least one FH2-containing protein, supporting the notion that the FH2 domain belongs to a set
of proteins present already in the last common ancestor of
eukaryotes. However, we were unable to find any possible
prokaryotic relatives, i.e. bacterial or archeal proteins
exhibiting significant similarity to the FH2 domain.

Somewhat surprisingly, we have noticed that considerable
expansion of the FH2 protein family is not restricted to
multicellular organisms. In contrary, nearly all complete
genomes analyzed (except three ascomycete fungi whose
genomes are still at a draft stage) encoded at least two
FH2-containing proteins, and even unicellular organisms
such as the excavate Naegleria gruberi (a flagellate amoeba)
or the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia possess 15 or 14 formins, respectively – i.e. a number comparable to that
reported previously for mammals [6] or flowering plants
[8].
Phylogeny of the FH2 domain: evidence for multiple
independent gene duplications
The apparent widespread multiplication of formin-encoding genes in diverse lineages raises the question whether
any of the extant formins can be assigned to well-defined
groups of orthologues beyond those identified in previous
phylogenetic studies [5,6,8]. We have thus constructed a
detailed phylogenetic tree of the FH2 domains of nearly
300 formin sequences from our collection (Figure 1, Additional file 3).

We have successfully recovered all the major previously
reported formin groups, namely the 7 metazoan classes
(Fmn, FHOD, Frl, Daam, Delphilin, Dia, Inf), a compact
group of yeast (i.e. ascomycete) formins [6], as well as
plant Class I and Class II formins [7]. Noticeably, choanoflagellate (Monosiga brevicollis) FH2 domains tend to cluster together with animal ones in most cases. Three new

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/115

clades containing FH2 domains of multiple organism
have been recovered – namely two branches containing
most (but not all) basidiomycete and zygomycete formins, a cluster containing the majority of ciliate formins,
and a somewhat poorly supported cluster of adjacent
branches containing exclusively stramenopile sequences
(Figure 1). Nevertheless, many of protist formins could
not be assigned to any of the previously defined classes;
and also some algal formins fell into the unresolved deep
branches together with the majority of protist sequences.
This could perhaps be at least partially due to erosion of
meaningful phylogenetic signal by a build-up of mutations, and possibly also to long branch-associated artifacts.
On the contrary, topologies of some of the well-defined
branches, in particular the plant Class I and Class II formins where numerous sequences have been included in the
analysis, as well as the FHOD cluster, indicate a relatively
low degree of within-class divergence that suggests recent
diversification (unless we assume major between-branch
differences in selection pressure). It is thus likely that multiple duplications of formin-encoding genes took place
independently in diverse lineages.
To our surprise, a third group of FH2 domains, possibly
related to plant Class I but distinct from them, was found
in some non-seed plants, namely in the lycophyte Selaginella moelendorffii, the moss Physcomitrella patens and in
two prasinophyte algae (Ostreococcus sp.). Since this group
exhibits also a specific domain organization (see below),
we suggest recognizing these formins as a specific subgroup of plant FH2-containing proteins. We will further
refer to these proteins as plant Class III formins.
Diversity of formin domain architectures
While phylogenetic analysis based on FH2 domain
sequences captures evolution driven by point mutations,
it provides no information on domains outside FH2. We
have therefore searched all complete formin sequences for
a collection of known protein domains from the SMART
and Pfam databases using the SMART search tool [28,29].
In addition, BLAST was used to search for homologues of
the plant FH2-associated PTEN-like domain that is not
included in the SMART/Pfam domain set [8]. Results are
summarized in Table 1 (non-plant lineages), Table 2 (a
more detailed view of plant formins) and in Additional
files 4 and 5.

The majority of FH2 proteins analyzed appears to contain
a rather limited selection of additional domains outside
FH2, with the canonical GBD/FH3-FH1-FH2 set being the
most frequent domain architecture. The C-terminal DAD
motif usually found in GBD/FH3-containing formins is
defined very stringently in the Pfam database, as it detects

An overview of conserved domains and motifs in non-plant FH2 proteins. For each group of organisms, presence or absence of conserved domains
or motifs found in formins of at least two species is indicated (if found in at least two proteins of only one lineage, they are listed as "other"); for
more detailed table including single-instance domains, a full list of species and numbers of genes see Additional file 4. Domain abbreviations and
accessions are: FH1 – formin homology 1 (a polyproline stretch detected visually), GBD/FH3 – GTPase binding domain of Diaphanous-related
formins [Pfam: Drf_GBD] and/or FH3 domain of Diaphanous-related formins [Pfam: Drf_FH3], DAD – Diaphanous autoinhibitory domain [Pfam:
Drf_DAD]; PH – pleckstrin homology domain [Smart: SM00233], ANK – ankyrin repeats [Smart: SM00248], C2 – protein kinase C conserved
region 2 [Smart: SM00239], PDZ – domain present in PSD-95, Dlg, and ZO-1/2 [Smart: SM00228]; PTEN – phosphatase and tensin homology
domain (identified by BLAST), tm – a secretion signal/transmembrane helix combination.

only a subset of proteins reported to contain it (namely
formins of the Diaphanous subfamily) and misses, e.g.,
all yeast and Dictyostelium formins, as well as some
mammalian ones. We will further refer to "GBD/FH3FH1-FH2" architecture or "GBD/FH3-containing formins" in all cases where the presence of DAD could not be
documented by statistically significant detection of the
Pfam motif [Pfam: Drf_DAD], reserving the full "GBD/
FH3-FH1-FH2-DAD" description to cases where this
motif was found unambiguously. Nevertheless, we
believe that presence of GBD/FH3 is likely to indicate regulation by means of GTPase-dependent release of

intramolecular inhibition via a canonical or variant DAD
that may be detected upon visual inspection [5] and data
not shown). GBD/FH3-containing formins have been
found in representatives of all kingdoms with the exception of plants, although only in animals and fungi they
were present in all species; this is consistent with this
domain architecture being ancestral.
Major eukaryotic lineages exhibit substantial differences
in the degree of formin architecture diversity. Fungi represent one extreme; indeed, all fungal formins studied
exhibited the standard GBD/FH3-FH1-FH2 combination,

and no other conserved domains were identified. On the
other end of the scale are some chromalveolate lineages,
in particular the stramenopiles, and, to a lesser extent, also
the metazoa, which have combined the FH2 domain with
a diverse array of other conserved modules. Although
such "exotic" formin structures have to be interpreted cautiously, since gene prediction artifacts cannot be excluded
in the absence of experimentally determined cDNA
sequences, at least in one case (the Caenorhabditis elegans
FOZI-1 protein [30]), a protein containing FH2 in combination with a DNA binding (zinc finger) domain exhibited biological activity.

associated GTPase activating protein (RhoGAP). We will
discuss this domain, which appears to be specific to plant
Class III formins, in more detail below. A schematic view
of some of the observed formin domain organizations is
presented in Figure 2.
A novel RhoGAP-like domain in formins of non-seed plants
The novel, plant-specific combination of a Class III FH2
domain and a RhoGAP-related domain was found in four
proteins: one from a lycophyte (Selmo2a/b), one from a
moss (Phypa7) and one each from two prasinophytes
(Ostta1 and Ostlu1). Another prasinophyte genome
released after the submission of our manuscript (two
clones of Micromonas pusilla sp.) also appears to encode at
least one Class III formin upon brief inspection (see JGI
Protein ID: 100127 and Protein ID: 47518). To our surprise, detailed examination of an alignment of the
RhoGAP-related domain sequences revealed significant
deviations from the common RhoGAP consensus, most
notably replacement of the central arginine of the
"arginine finger" [31,32] which appears to be involved in
GTPase activation by Ras, Rho and Rab GAPs, by a small
aliphatic or polar residue. Also a similarly conserved
lysine residue downstream of the arginine finger appears
to be replaced by leucine in all the plant sequences (Figure

Some chromalveolate species, such as Cryptosporidium parvum, Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum, as well as the excavates Leishmania major and
Trypanosoma sp., lack GBD/FH3-containing formins altogether. However, plants represent the only kingdom that
appears to have entirely disposed of the canonical structure. Instead, they possess up to three major groups of
formins. Besides the previously described Class I (usually
transmembrane) and Class II (PTEN-containing) formins
characteristic for angiosperm plants [8], we found that the
novel Class III formins of some non-seed plant species
carry a N-terminal domain homologous to the Rho –

3). A three-dimensional model of the RhoGAP-related
domain constructed by threading of Phypa7 on known
Rho or RacGAP domain structures (Additional file 6)
indeed confirmed a local alteration in shape and charge of
the conserved GTPase interaction interface, while the
overall conformation of the molecule appears preserved.
Thus, the RhoGAP-like domain of Class III thus might not
function as a GTPase-activating protein, while its ability to
bind a Rho-class GTPase may be retained. Nevertheless,
since an alternative mechanism of GTPase activation
involving an asparagine at a closely related position
instead of the arginine finger has been described for
Rap1GAP [33], we cannot exclude that the GAP domains
of Class III formins also "invented" their own way of supporting GTPase activity.
Identification of RhoGAP-related domains in Class III
formins of prasinophytes and two early land plants (the
moss Physcomitrella and the lycophyte Selaginella)
prompted us to search for closely related domains among
the previously characterized members of the RhoGAP
family. In phylogenetic trees based on a combination of
Class III RhoGAP-domain sequences with a recently published set of human RhoGAPs [34], the RhoGAP-like
domains from Class III formins cluster together, however
their relation to any of the human RhoGAPs cannot be
resolved (data not shown). A BLAST search of the nonredundant NCBI Entrez database with the Phypa7
RhoGAP domain as a query identifies predominantly
metazoan (especially insect), fungal and Dictyostelium
proteins with E-values in the range of 5.10-9 to 10-4, the
only exception being Ostta1. The remaining RhoGAP-like
domains of Class III formins find no significant matches
by BLAST; however, they produce results analogous to
Phypa7 when the more sensitive PSI-BLAST algorithm
[35] is used. We can thus conclude that the RhoGAP-like
domains of Class III formins are more closely related to
opisthokont RhoGAPs than to plant RopGAPs.

PTEN-containing domains outside land plants
Several of the observed domain architectures were found
in formins of multiple distantly related lineages. If multiple instances are found within one kingdom (e.g. in case
of the PDZ domain in metazoans or the PH and ANK
domains of stramenopiles), kingdom-specific acquisition
followed by gene loss is the obvious explanation. However, some domains exhibit a discontinuous or punctate
distribution across more than one kingdom. This is the
case e.g. of the C2 domain (single instances in Dictyostelium and stramenopile formins), the PH domain (sole
occurrences in two stramenopiles and the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis), the PTEN domain (relatively
common in stramenopiles and plants), and the secretion
signal – transmembrane segment combination (common
in plants, rare in invertebrates, two cases in the amplified

formin family of Naegleria; outside plants, only the
Caenorhabditis case is cDNA-supported). The first two
domains occur in isolated instances, suggesting independent origins of the C2-FH2 and PH-FH2 combinations,
while the small size and relatively loose sequence requirements for secretion and transmembrane signals points to
possible convergent evolution. The case of PTEN is more
complex, and deserves a detailed analysis.
The PTEN-related domain is characteristic for plant Class
II formins, found in angiosperms, lycophytes and mosses.
However, it was also identified in prasinophyte formins
that cannot be reliably assigned to any of the three FH2
clades characteristic for land plants (see Figure 1, Table 2
and Additional file 5), as well as in formins of stramenopiles (namely diatoms and the plant parasite Phytophtora
sp.). The relationships between stramenopiles and plants
may be somewhat suggestive of horizontal gene transfer
associated with either endosymbiosis or parasitism (in
Phytophtora), although this can be neither confirmed nor
rejected on the basis of the FH2 domain sequence since
the relationship of stramenopile FH2 to the plant formins
remains unresolved.
To obtain insight into possible origins of discontinuous
phylogenetic distribution of the PTEN-FH2 architecture,
we have assembled a collection of 63 "standalone" PTEN
domain sequences (i.e. sequences of PTEN-containing
proteins that do not carry the FH2 domain) from 30 species (see Additional files 7 and 8) and performed a phylogenetic analysis, including also 36 PTEN domains of the
previously identified plant and stramenopile formins.
After removing sequences whose inclusion would have
introduced gaps that would lead to substantial shortening
of the alignment, we obtained a tree (Figure 4), which
exhibits a generally better statistic support than the FH2
domain tree and classifies the PTEN domains of prasinophyte formins as sister group of the PTEN domains of
angiosperm Class II formins, while stramenopile FH2associated PTEN domains form a separate clade. However,
a tree based on a shorter alignment including more
sequences (Additional file 9) swaps the position of the
prasinophyte and stramenopile FH2-associated PTEN
domains; thus we have to consider their relationship to
angiosperm Class II formins still unresolved. Nevertheless, neither tree supports monophyletic ancestry of PTEN
domains from prasinophyte and stramenopile formins,
suggesting an independent origin of the PTEN-FH2 association rather than horizontal gene transfer.
Independent acquisition of a PTEN-like domain in stramenopile formins is also supported by the finding that,
similar to plant Class II formins [8], the prasinophyte, but
not stramenopile, formins lack a crucial arginine residue
in the conserved catalytic site of the PTEN protein/lipid

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/115

phosphatase [36,37] and are thus unlikely to exhibit enzymatic activity. However, stramenopile formins have
retained the canonical arginine residue (Figure 5). Nevertheless, they also probably lost the catalytic activity, since
they are missing another conserved residue (the histidine
within the conserved H-C-X-X-G-X-X-R signature motif),
raising thus the possibility that stramenopiles not only
independently invented the PTEN-FH2 domain architecture, but also found their own way to disable the enzyme
activity of the PTEN domain.

Discussion
Formins (FH2 domain-containing proteins) are an abundant family of actin-organizing proteins conserved across
multiple major eukaryotic lineages. However, detailed
phylogenetic analyses so far focused only on
opisthokonts, Dictyostelium and angiosperm plants [2,58]. While the results provided a glimpse of the extent of
formin domain architecture variability, little was known
until now about FH2 protein diversity outside these lineages. An attempt to trace down the origins of the conserved parts of the actin-nucleating machinery, including
formins, failed to identify significant relatives of the conserved FH2 domain among prokaryotes. Nevertheless,
formins were found in all eukaryotes sampled so far
(except Giardia), suggesting their presence already in the
last common ancestor of eukaryotes [38]. In this study, we
attempt to map the diversity of formins across most
eukaryotic kingdoms, focusing not only on the FH2
domain itself but also on the overall domain architecture
of the multi-domain FH2-containing proteins, and to
reconstruct a possible evolutionary scenario that has produced the unique domain architectures found in formins
of present-day plants.
The selection of species sampled was constrained mainly
by public availability of searchable complete or draft
genome sequences. We have included representatives of
most major eukaryotic kingdoms [27,39]: animals (metazoans and choanoflagellates), several lineages of fungi,
amoebozoa, chromalveolates, excavates and a diverse
selection of plants. We could not include any representative of the Rhizaria because of lack of data. However,
recent phylogenetic studies suggest that the rhizarians
may, in fact, represent a branch of chromalveolates
[40,41], which would mean that our collection covers all
major eukaryotic lineages.
Since we focused on the origins of the domain architecture of plant formins, we sampled the plant lineage in
more detail. Our analysis covers three complete genomes
and several cDNA or EST collections from angiosperms,
one moss genome, five algal genomes representing the
chlorophytes, prasinophytes and rhodophytes, and a partial genome sequence from a lycophyte. However, data are

still lacking from many lineages that may be crucial for
filling the gaps in our evolutionary reconstruction. In particular, gymnosperm sequences might aid in pinpointing
the disappearance of Class III formins that are present in
mosses and lycophytes but absent in angiosperms, charophyte data would probably help to resolve the events associated with acquisition of the Class I (transmembrane)
formin architecture characteristic for land plants, and
glaucophyte data would provide insight into the early
steps in the establishment of the plant lineage.
An initial database search revealed an astonishing diversity of formins in most eukaryotes. With the exception of
some ascomycete fungi, all organisms studied have at
least two formin-encoding genes, and the number exceeds
a dozen in many lineages, including the unicellular flagellate amoeba Naegleria. Thus, the diversity of formins obviously does not reflect functional demands related to
production of multiple cell types or complex cell-to-cell
boundaries, as would be expected from observations of
tissue-specific expression of some formins in metazoans
[42-45] or plants [12] or from subcellular domain-specific
localization of formin proteins in metazoan [46-48] and
plant [13,14,49] cells. A recent large-scale analysis of 1219
protein superfamilies indicates that such a lack of correlation with the organisms' biological complexity (roughly

quantifiable e.g. on the basis of estimates of the number
of cell types) may represent a rather typical situation [50].
Nevertheless, highest numbers of formins among unicellular organisms were found in Naegleria and Paramecium,
i.e. in organisms possessing rather sophisticated cell surface structures that might also bring specific requirements
on (cortical) cytoskeletal organizers, including the FH2
proteins.
We have performed a detailed phylogenetic analysis of
nearly 300 FH2 domain sequences (see Figure 1 and Additional file 3). Because of the relatively small size and high
divergence of the FH2 domain, only limited resolution
was achieved. Moreover, lack of a suitable outgroup prevented convincing characterization of mutual relationships between the well-defined branches. Nevertheless,
we have confirmed the presence of the 7 previously proposed mammalian groups [6], and two classes in
angiosperm plants [7]. However, the basal position and
monophyly of fungal formins, originally suggested on the
basis of a very limited set of data [6], was not confirmed,
albeit FH2 domains of ascomycete yeasts did cluster
together (but apart from basidiomycete and zygomycete
ones, which together formed a separate branch). Even
within the conserved clades, identification of orthologues

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:115

is difficult or impossible. The topology of the wellresolved branches of the phylogenetic tree strongly suggests that they represent clusters of paralogues that have
arisen by series of independent, species-specific gene
duplication events. Besides of the previously known two
plant formin classes, we have identified a novel formin
clade present only in non-seed green plants (i.e. prasinophyte algae Ostreococcus sp., the moss Physcomitrella patens,
and the lycophyte Selaginella moelendorffii), which we
termed Class III.
Analysis of the domain architecture of our formin collection revealed several novel domain combinations besides
the "canonical" opisthokont GBD/FH3-FH1-FH2 structure and the two architectures previously described for
angiosperms (see Table 1 and 2, Figure 2 and Additional
file 4 and 5). Some of these novel architectures have
already been described either in the course of systematic
surveys [2,5,8] or incidentally on the occasion of cDNA or
gene cloning (e.g. the FH1-less Dictyostelium formin ForC
[51], or the Caenorhabditis FOZI-1, which carries a zinc finger motif [30]).
In particular, the association between the PTEN domain
(occurring in plant Class II formins and some stramenopile ones) exhibited a discontinuous (or punctate sensu
[52]) distribution across the eukaryotic evolutionary tree,
indicating either two independent gene fusion events,
repeated losses or horizontal gene transfer. Independent
origin of identical domain combinations is considered
extremely rare and thus unlikely [53]. However, this conclusion was based on an analysis of a sample of 57
prokaryotic genomes and only 5 eukaryotic ones, and its
validity for eukaryotes may be therefore questionable.
Since the PTEN domains of stramenopile formins do not
form a sister group to those of plant Class II formins (Figure 4), we indeed suspect that the association between the
PTEN and FH2 domains was established twice. Moreover,
independent association with the FH2 domain was in
both cases accompanied by an obvious loss of a conserved
catalytic site, which was accomplished by different means
in each lineage, i.e. again in a convergent fashion (Figure
5).
Mutational inactivation of conserved, originally biochemically active domains might indeed present a common
theme in formin evolution. We found that all formins
with Class III FH2 domains posses a N-terminal domain
exhibiting considerable similarity to the Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) family proteins. However, the
conserved arginine finger, essential for stimulation of the
Rho GTPase activity by RhoGAPs [32,54], appears to be
eliminated by mutations in all cases. Thus, the RhoGAPlike domain of plant Class III formins is unlikely to act as
a GTPase activating protein, unless it acquired the ability

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/115

to activate GTPases through a different mechanism, as
described in the case of the mammalian Rap1GAP [33].
"Inactive" members of the RhoGAP family have been
identified previously, such as mammalian p85, which lost
the GAP activity while retaining its arginine finger, ARAP2
that lacks the arginine finger [55], or mammalian and fungal IQGAPs [56,57]. We believe that although proteins
with GAP domains are generally viewed predominantly as
functionally well-defined components of the GTPase
functional cycle, at least some of them obviously have
acquired additional functions besides facilitating GTP
hydrolysis and thus "re-setting" or "erasing" a signal carried by a GTP-loaded or "active" GTPase. Obviously, to
facilitate GTP hydrolysis, GAPs have to interact with GTPloaded GTPases, becoming thus also prime candidates for
their effectors. In case of plant Class III formins, ARAP2,
IQGAP or p85, this presumed effector function apparently
became selectively advantageous enough to allow surviving subsequent loss of the GAP activity. Indeed, IQGAPs
have been originally discovered as effectors of Rho family
GTPases, especially Cdc42 [56,57].
The Rho GTPases are peripheral membrane proteins wellknown for their participation in the control of cell surfaceassociated actin cytoskeleton, contributing to the formation of structures as diverse as lamellipodia and filopodia
of animal cells, yeast buds, and plant root hairs and/or
pollen tubes (for a review see [38,58-60]. IQGAPs mediate
Rho GTPase-based control of actin organization at the
leading edge and cell-to-cell junctions of mammalian cells
[56,57,61]. The C-terminal inactive GAP domain of
IQGAP binds to activated Rho and functions as a GAP
inhibitor [56], while the N-terminal calponin domain
interacts with the F-actin, effectively stimulating F-actin
accumulation at the activated Rho cell-cell contact junctions [62,63].
The conserved domain architecture of formins carrying a
GTPase-binding domain (GBD/FH3), believed to mediate
Rho-dependent activation of the formin through releasing
intramolecular inhibition, stresses out the ancestral
nature of another connection between Rho and actin
organization – namely formin-mediated actin nucleation
[5]. However, plants have apparently lost the canonical
GBD/FH3-FH1-FH2 architecture. Nevertheless, our
present analysis of the phylogenetic distribution of
formin domain architectures in the plant lineage suggests
that the ability to interact with a Rho type GTPase presents
a crucial conserved feature of many (though not all) formins even in plants. In particular, the combination of a presumably inactive RhoGAP-like domain with an F-actin
interacting domain in early land plant formins is reminiscent of IQGAPs, despite opposite domain order (the GAPrelated domain is N-terminal in formins and C-terminal
in IQGAPs), suggesting a remarkable convergence also on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/115

the functional level. We suggest that the extant common
architectures of plant Class I, Class II and Class III formins
may have been produced by a relatively simple sequence
of evolutionary events that has maintained a continuity of
the Rho-FH2 and/or membrane-FH2 association, while
the molecular mechanisms of these connections have
changed (Figure 6).
First, the ancestral GBD/FH3 domain was replaced by a
probably catalytically inactive RhoGAP-like domain at
some point prior to the divergence of algae (prasinophytes and chlorophytes) and the lineage leading to
extant vascular plants. This event was concomitant with
the emergence of Class III formins. We can only speculate
about the situation in Rhodophyta since the only genome
analyzed, that of Cyanidioschyzon merolae, represents an

A possible scenario of formin evolution

formin domain architectures mapped on a phylogenetic tree
of selected eukaryotic lineages, with focus on plants. Typical
domain architectures are color-coded: GBD/FH3-FH1-FH2

extremely derived, fast-evolving group [64] that either lost
Class III formins or never possessed them (and disposed
of the GBD/FH3 architecture independently). With
respect to rhodophytes, the scenario shown in Figure 6
thus presents one of two equally parsimonious possibilities that maintain the Rho-FH2 connection; an alternative
would involve replacement of GBD/FH3 by the RhoGAPlike domain only after the divergence of red algae, and
loss of GBD/FH3 in the rhodophyte lineage.
In the "green" lineage leading towards green algae and
vascular plants, a domain fusion produced the combination of FH2 with a catalytically inactive PTEN-related
domain, generating thus the typical Class II architecture
and providing a possible alternative mechanism for
attachment of FH2 to a membrane. It is worth noting that
the only chlorophytes lacking both Class II and Class III
type architectures are the volvocal algae. We believe that
this may again be a derived feature, since the recently published Chlamydomonas genome sequence [65] reveals that
this organism has apparently lost Rho-type GTPases altogether, possibly together with the whole associated molecular apparatus.
Finally, in the vascular plant lineage a series of gene duplications took place in the formin gene family, starting prior
to the divergence of Bryophyta but continuing later on.
Amplified formin genes provided material for subsequent
domain shuffling that produced the rich diversity of formins in extant angiosperms. It is tempting to speculate that
this diversification may have been coincident with the
ascent of plants on dry land. One of the innovations that
appeared at the same time was the emergence of membrane-anchored Class I formins. Once the Class I and
Class II formins became established, plants acquired Rhoindependent means for associating the FH2 domains with
membranes, which enabled subsequent loss of Class III
formins in the angiosperm lineage.
In the course of our study, we have noticed that the diversity of formin domain architectures varies substantially
among major eukaryotic lineages (Table 1 and 2, Additional data file 4 and 5), suggesting a variety of possible
regulatory inputs controlling the activity of the FH2
domain, its localization and interactions with diverse
intracellular structures. Despite of their rich formin gene
families, neither plants nor metazoans present an extreme
of FH2 domain mobility – the most diverse and variable
formin architectures in our collection were apparently
those of chromalveolates, mainly stramenopiles (while
the other extreme is provided by ascomycete fungi). However, major differences in formin diversity are not
restricted to the level of kingdoms (even if we take into
account possible gene structure mispredictions). In particular, invertebrate metazoans, such as molluscs or

Page 12 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:115

Caenorhabditis, possess unusual domain combinations,
such as formins carrying a membrane insertion signal or a
zinc finger [30].
This leads to the open question what determines the varying degree of FH2 domain mobility, or promiscuity, in
diverse lineages. Apparently this is not a feature of the
FH2 domain per se, since all fungal, insect, crustacean and
kinetoplastide formins studied so far exhibit only the
canonical GBD/FH3-FH1-FH2 architecture or its even
simpler FH1-FH2 variant. Alternatively, we could imagine
that some lineages have a general tendency to amplify
genes and generate novel domain combinations; thus,
organisms with unusual formin architectures should also
exhibit greater diversity in other modular, multidomain
proteins. However, this is not the case – Caenorhabditis elegans has one of the richest families of formins among animals, but at least one other modular domain, namely
SH2, exhibits rather modest diversity compared to other
metazoans (Tony Pawson, personal communication).
Indeed, results of a large-scale analysis of eukaryotic proteins containing domains from the Pfam database suggested that protein domains form lineage-rather than
domain-specific combinations [66]. Although the authors
of the cited study consider this an animal-specific feature,
their conclusion is based on a data set containing mostly
animal and fungal genomes, and only very few species
from other lineages. In particular, no stramenopiles have
been included, and plants were represented only by Arabidopsis, rice and the highly derived rhodophyte Cyanidioschyzon merolae. Upon closer inspection of the data from
[66], mere omission of C. merolae would lead to the result
that plants (i.e. Arabidopsis and rice) have a number of lineage-specific domain combinations comparable to that of
mammals and birds.
Results of our analysis of the formin structure in plants
and other eukaryotes thus support the conclusion that
domain architecture variability is not only a lineage-specific characteristic, but also a feature of the protein family
involved. On a more general level, they also point out the
limits for extrapolation from lineage-biased data, which,
after all, only provide information about the species analyzed.

Conclusion
Our analysis of a set of nearly 300 formin sequences from
a variety of species representing most of the eukaryotic
diversity revealed a surprising variability in terms of gene
number and domain composition both among and
within individual lineages. Apart of ancestral domain
combinations, such as the ubiquitous FH1-FH2 or the
nearly ubiquitous GBD/FH3-FH1-FH2 architecture, lineage-specific domain architectures were found in particular
in the plant lineage, where we identified a novel class of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/115

formins carrying a presumably catalytically inactive variant of the conserved RhoGAP domain. At least in case of
the FH2 domain-containing proteins, we can conclude
that the selection or "space" of available domain combinations is determined not only by the participating
domains themselves, but also (or even predominantly) by
the organismal lineage. Nevertheless, we were able to
detect cases of repeated independent emergence of
domain combinations, such as PTEN-FH1-FH2 in plants
and stramenopiles, suggesting that there may be a certain
preference of domain partnerships. In any case, we can
conclude that the frequency of convergent domain combinations may be higher than expected before on the basis
of predominantly prokaryotic data.

Identification of FH2 and PTEN-containing proteins
Genes encoding putative formin or PTEN homologues
have been identified by BLASTP and TBLASTN searches
[35,82] of the above databases, first using previously characterized members of the family [8,26] as the query, then
with the most diverged sequences from the first round as
the query, until no new significant matches appeared. In
addition, annotation searches using the keywords "actinbinding FH2" have been used, in particular in the case of
the JGI protein predictions. Presence of FH2 domains in
predicted candidate open reading frames has been confirmed by a SMART search [28,83] for all genes. Final database checks have been done between September and
November 2007.

Sequence alignments
Preliminary alignments used e.g, for identification of possible missing exons (see above) have been constructed
using the very fast and reliable Kalign program [98,99].
Final multiple sequence alignments for phylogenetic purposes were constructed using PROBCONS [100] with
default parameters and manually edited in BioEdit [101]
in order to remove short blocks and gap, as well as
increase aligned amino acid similarity, as visually judged
with the aid of a BLOSUM62-derived color code and consensus shading. Prior to phylogenetic tree calculation,
non-aligned ends have been trimmed and all portions of
the alignment where a substantial number of sequences
contained gaps have been removed.

Revision of protein sequence predictions
Gene predictions have been checked and, if necessary, corrected essentially as described previously [8], based on
information from algorithmic splice site predictions, EST
or cDNA sequences, as well as comparison with closest
homologous proteins. A cDNA prediction was accepted if
it was supported by experimental data and/or multiple
prediction methods; if possible, a variant closest to the
consensus of the conserved domain(s) has been used. In
several cases we modified the proposed protein sequence
or even joined two neighboring ORFs previously predicted as separate genes. All the newly predicted or modified protein sequences are listed in Additional file 2.

For the construction of Figure 3, DeepView [102] was used
to align the four known RhoGAP structures together with
the computed three-dimensional model of the Phypa7
RhoGAP domain. Corresponding structure-based
sequence alignment was exported into a text file, manually converted to the FASTA format and imported into
BioEdit [101]. The remaining three Class III formin
RhoGAP sequences were then added and aligned manually, using a Kalign-generated alignment for reference.

For each new gene, splice sites were predicted using at
least three of the following eukaryotic gene-prediction
programs: GeneMark.hmm [84], FGENESH [85] at the
Softberry, Inc. website [86], TWINSCAN [87], GeneScan
[88] and GENEWISE [89]. FGENESH with similarities
(FGENESH +) at [86] was used if the genomic sequence
quality was poor or if other programs failed to predict a
protein containing the FH2 domain, although a BLAST
search revealed a significant match. MACAW [90] was
used to map the resulting predictions, as well as EST or
cDNA sequences found by BLAST (if available), to the
genomic sequence. Utilities of the Sequence manipulation suite [91] have been employed for routine sequence
manipulations, such as assembly of predicted ORF
sequences or translation.
Domain architecture analysis
SMART version 5.1 [28,29] has been used to search for
conserved domains as described previously [8]. These
searches were complemented by direct Pfam 22.0 database searches [92,93] that revealed additional matches, in
particular for the GBD/FH3 and RhoGAP domains. Secretory signals and transmembrane segments have been verified using SignalP and TMHMM [94-96] on the CBS
Prediction server [97].

Phylogenetic analyses
Phylogenetic trees were build on the basis of multiple
alignments constructed as described above using two different algorithms: a heuristic approximation of the maximum likelihood (ML) method as implemented in the
PHYML program[103] and the neighbor-joining (NJ)
method using the software package MEGA [104], which
was also employed for bootstrap sample derivation and
graphical representation of the resulting trees. In both
cases, the JTT amino acid substitution matrix was used,
and statistical significance of the result was estimated
using bootstrap analysis with 100 to 500 samples.
3D model construction
An initial search for suitable threading templates for three
plant RhoGAP sequences (Selmo2a/b, Phypa7 and
Ostta1) performed using the ExPDB function of SwissModel [105,106] yielded no reliable templates. Two additional methods were thus used: CPH Models [107] and
QuickPhyre, a web implementation of Phyre [108,109],
which also computes a 3D model for the best templates
found. In case of Phypa7, both approaches yielded significant hits corresponding to known Rho- or RacGAP
domains (PDB:1XA6 by CPH; PDB:1F7C, 1PBW, 1RGP,
1TX4 and 1XA6 with 100% confidence and E-values of 107 or better). Since the results were substantially worse for
the remaining plant sequences, we chose Phypa7 for
model construction using SwissModel, based on an alignment of templates found by the Phyre algorithm.
Although the WhatCheck output provided by SwissModel

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:115

reported some protein backbone problems, the resulting
model appeared to be very similar to models generated by
Phyre on all the highly probable templates. In particular,
3D alignment in the DeepView environment [110]
revealed that the area of the arginine finger appears to be
nearly identical in all models, while peripheral parts of
the molecule somewhat diverged (shown in pale colour in
Figure 3). Moreover, WhatCheck control [111-113], performed separately for those parts of the molecule where
the models agreed, revealed similar problems in the templates themselves. We thus believe that our model reflects
reasonably well the conformation around the conserved
GTPase interaction interface.
