Optimization of PCR conditions to amplify
microsatellite loci in the bunchgrass lizard
(Sceloporus slevini) genomic DNA
Satya S Narina*, Christian A d’Orgeix, Brian L Sayre

Abstract
Background: Microsatellites, also called Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs), repetitions of nucleotide motifs of 1-5
bases, are currently the markers of choice due to their abundant distribution in the genomes, and suitability for
high-throughput analysis. A total of five different primer pairs were optimized for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
to amplify microsatellite loci in total genomic DNA of bunchgrass lizards (Sceloporus slevini) collected from three
sites in southeastern Arizona; the Sonoita Plain, Chiricahua Mountains and Huachuca Mountains.
Findings: The primers used for current investigation were originally designed for the Eastern Fence Lizard
(Sceloporus undulatus). Five primer pairs were selected based on annealing temperatures for optimizing the PCR
conditions to amplify with bunchgrass lizards. Different concentrations of DNA and annealing temperature were
optimized. While keeping other reagents constant, a DNA concentration, 37.5 ng in the final reaction volume and
PCR conditions of an initial denaturation of 94°C for five minutes, an annealing temperature of 55°C and final
extension of 72°C for four minutes gave the best amplification for all the primer pairs.
Conclusions: Modifying the standard protocol for annealing temperatures and final extension time increases the
success of cross amplification of specific microsatellite loci in the bunchgrass lizard. A loading volume of 5 ul DNA
at a concentration of 10 ng/ul and a 2% agarose for gel electrophoresis were observed the best for cross
amplification of selected five primer pairs on bunch grass lizard.
Trial Registration: The research was conducted with Arizona Game and Fish Department scientific collecting
permits SP565256, SP657407 & SP749119 to Dr. Christian A d’Orgeix.

Background
Small, isolated or bottlenecked populations suffer
reduced genetic diversity increasing their potential for
extinction [1]. Terrestrial “islands” such as mountain
tops can function to isolate populations and reduce or
halt gene flow between populations [2,3]. Slevin’s
bunchgrass lizard, Sceloporus slevini [4] inhabits both
disjunct mountain grasslands in southeastern Arizona,
southwestern New Mexico, the Sierra Madre Occidental
of Mexico [5-7] and lower elevation grasslands in the
Sonoita plain and Canelo grasslands in Arizona [7,8].
The disjunct population distribution of S. slevini and the
recent bottleneck of a low elevation population [8] make

it an ideal species to test a model of reduced genetic
diversity within disjunct or bottlenecked populations.
A necessary preliminary step in examining the genetic
characteristics of this species is to develop molecular
species specific markers. Species-specific microsatellite
markers [9] can be used to elucidate gene flow patterns
and genetic diversity studies [10]. The SSR based microsatellite markers have been developed for a large number of plant [11,12] and animal [13] species and are
increasingly being used for ascertaining germplasm
improvement. The primer sequences used for the current project were originally developed for the Eastern
Fence Lizard [14].
An important limitation, however, regarding use of
microsatellites for polymorphism or genetic diversity
studies is the prior need for optimization of PCR conditions for each SSR marker [15]. The Genomic DNA

sequence variation between two different species might
cause the variation in cross amplification success as the
primers might identify a different region in the species
of interest from the expected region. Required amplification may not be obtained using the recommended protocol due to involvement of many factors such as
different types/brands of thermocyclers, reaction components, or even minor differences in thickness of walls of
PCR tubes [16]. In addition, the quality and quantity of
template DNA obtained with different DNA extraction
protocols may also affect the PCR results.
The primer sequences selected for the current study
were originally developed for S. undulatus, [14]. These
primers were used to amplify the genomic DNA of
S. slevini following the protocol published [14]. The
cross amplification was not satisfactory even though
S. slevini is a congener of S. undulatus. In order to
reduce the time and cost involved in generation of ESTs
and development of new primers from S.selvini, further
protocol standardization was undertaken [16] by changing
the annealing temperatures. PCR conditions were optimized for 5 SSR markers in S. slevini. In addition to PCR,
agarose gel concentrations and sample loading volume
were also optimized for clear visibility of microsatellites.

Results
The PCR conditions standardized for microsatellite amplification in this study were an initial denaturation at 94°C
for five minutes; 35 cycles of denaturation (94°C) for 30
seconds, annealing (55°C) for 30 seconds, extension (72°C)
for one minute followed by final extension at 72°C for four
minutes. The current study achieved excellent cross
amplification performance using the standardized PCR
conditions and was visualized on simple agarose gel electrophoresis, though the preferred method was the standard DNA sequencing gel electrophoresis. Previous
studies have indicated that the optimal annealing temperature was 58-60°C (Ta ≥ 56°C, [14]). However the PCR of
selected markers at these conditions failed to amplify
45 out of the 50 samples tried. A series of PCRs were performed using these primer sets at multiple temperatures
Viz., 53°C, 54°C, 55°C, 56°C, 57°C, 58°C, 59°C, 60°C and
61°C (Figure 1). The PCR products were not able to visualize on 1 to 1.5% agarose gels as solid bands. A series of
fragments or a shadow of the band was observed instead
of the solid single band. It was determined that it was
necessary to electrophorese the samples on a 2% agarose
gel inorder to eliminate the smaller fragments. The best
amplification conditions for successful amplification of all
the loci were at the lower annealing temperature of 55°C
(Figure 2) and visualized on 2% agarose gel. The figures
taken at annealing temperatures of 56°C and 59°C were
also included in Figure1 to visualize and compare the
improvement at 55°C in Figures 2 and 3.

The sequencing gel wasn’t used to visualize the microsatellite fragments as the objective of the current project
is to test the cross amplification of primers. As the primers are successfully cross amplified, the ongoing project will use these primers to screen the rest of the
population and observe the diversity.
There were 50 individuals scored for 5 markers (Table 1).
Not all the individuals amplified for all the five markers.
There are null alleles marked as 0 for each marker against
each individual in table 1. Individual H10 has no alleles for
all the five loci tested. Only seven individuals are amplified
at loci (marker) Sun_009 out of 50 tested. Among all
the five loci tested, Sun_007, Sun_011 and Sun_012 are
amplified in majority of the individuals. The loci Sun_011
and 012 are deviating from the expected size of 256 and

Discussion
Though the SSR primer sets were selected from S. undulatus, a relative of S. slevini, it was necessary to optimize
the PCR conditions for S. slevini in order to produce
readable results. The current study reveals that it is critical to optimize the reaction conditions prior to largescale application of each locus, such as phylogenetic/
genetic diversity studies. Interestingly, as shown in
Figures 2 and 3, a lower annealing temperature provided
more specific amplification of the locus. The reason for
this might be primer mismatches at higher temperatures
[17] as the primers were originally created for a related
species. At elevated temperatures the nucleation of the
primer hybridization becomes more difficult, thus, the
nonspecific target sites, with some mismatched base
pairs, compete with the specific target sites for the primer
hybridization. The ratio of primers binding to the correct
sites decreases allowing mismatched priming of the polymerization. Once the mismatched priming occurs, extension is also faster at higher temperatures, and thus, there
will be promotion of a nonspecific polymerization reaction. However, at 1 or 2°C lower annealing temperatures,
nucleation would take place easily and there will be no or
little competition of nonspecific sites with a couple of
mismatches for the correct target sites [18].
The current investigation also observed the primers
tested were all monomorphic on all the individuals
tested except for H13. This could be due to their same
origin or proximity within the taxon even though they
were collected from two different elevation points/geographical locations. The phylogenetic studies of lizard
[19] revealed a general pattern of strong character

support for the monopoly of species groups and weak
support for the relationship between them occurs in the
trees from the molecular, morphological and combined
data sets which might be due to the rapid speciation.
We found that the optimal temperature for cross
hybridization of the primer sets for S. slevini was lower
than the optimal temperature for the original species
(S. undulatus). This work confirmed that microsatellite
primers created for one species can be used in another
species with optimization of the primer sets as done in
several organisms previously [20,14]. By using this protocol, remaining markers will be studied and will be
used to characterize different populations of bunchgrass
lizard and to understand the evolutionary similarities
between the populations.

Conclusions
The current study standardized a PCR protocol to
amplify genomic DNA of S.slevini using the markers
developed for S. undulatus. By increasing or decreasing
the annealing temperatures and final extension time, the
success of cross amplification of specific microsatellite
loci increased markedly. The five markers tested were
monomorphic in the bunch grass lizard. This is preliminary effort in bunchgrass lizard to generate markers
due to non availability of funds and high throughput
equipment in the lab. Out of the five, the loic Sun_007,
Sun_011 and Sun_012 were usable for future screening
as the frequency of null alleles was very low among the
population tested. Further, these PCR products need to
be sequenced to know the exact size of the amplified
loci. These loci will be used to examine models of evolutionary history, gene flow patterns and inter and intrapopulation differences in S. slevini.
Methods
Research was conducted under Arizona Game and Fish
Department scientific collecting permits SP565256,
SP657407 & SP749119 to Christian d’Orgeix. All applicable institutional and international animal care guidelines were followed.
Tissues from S. selvini were collected from two high elevation populations (n = 16, Huachuca Mts and n = 15,
Chiricahua Mts) and one low elevation population (n = 6,
Appleton-Whittell Research Ranch, Elgin) in Arizona in
2006 and 2007. The lizards were caught by hand and
approximately 2-4 mm of their tail tips were removed
using tweezers. The lizards were then released at the site
of capture. Besides these there were 13 collections in the
department without geographical location information,
also included for current investigation. Tissues were
placed in 90% isopropyl alcohol for 1-2 months. DNA was
extracted using DNeasy tissue kit [21]. Approximately
25 mg of tissue (0.5 cm length of tail) was used for DNA

isolation using the protocol [21] and the extracted DNA
samples were stored at -20°C for future use.
DNA was quantified at 260 nm wavelength by using
Smart spec, 3000 spectrophotometer (http://www.bio-rad.
com/LifeScience/pdf/Bulletin_2634.pdf) and dilutions of
known concentrations were prepared. Absorbance ratios of
the extracted genomic DNA at 260 nm and 280 nm were
ranging from 1.34 to 2.00. Quality of DNA was also confirmed by electrophoresing DNA on 1.1% agarose gel. Out
of total 39 SSR markers previously reported [14] in Sceloporus undulatus, only 10 markers were tested in this study.
The PCRs were performed in the absence of oil for 50
μL of reaction volume using simple PCR reaction in BioRad’s “i"cycler. Reaction mixture included template DNA
(10 ng) solution, forward and reverse primers (0.15-0.30
μM), and Platinum PCR Supermix (Invitrogen Corporation). The cycling reactions were conducted for 5 min at
94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 sec denaturation step at
94°C, 0.5-1.0 min primer annealing step at varying temperatures of 53°C, 54°C, 55°C, 56°C, 57°C, 58°C, 60°C and
61°C, and 4 min extension step at 72°C. The amplification
of the markers were detected by running the amplicons on
2% agarose gel in 1X TBE buffer, stained with ethidium
bromide (500 ng/mL), visualized and photographed using
VersaDoc Imaging system Model 4000 (BIORAD suppliers). All gels were run at 106V constant power supply for
1-2 hours. We tried loading different volumes of DNA
(1-5 ul) with different concentrations from 5 to10 ng/ul.
The gel images were clear with solid bands at 10 ng/ul
concentration and loading volume of 5 ul.
