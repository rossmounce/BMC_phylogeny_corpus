Abstract
Background: Bracoviruses (BVs), a group of double-stranded DNA viruses with segmented genomes, are mutualistic
endosymbionts of parasitoid wasps. Virus particles are replication deficient and are produced only by female wasps from
proviral sequences integrated into the wasp genome. Virus particles are injected along with eggs into caterpillar hosts,
where viral gene expression facilitates parasitoid survival and therefore perpetuation of proviral DNA. Here we describe
a 223 kbp region of Glyptapanteles indiensis genomic DNA which contains a part of the G. indiensis bracovirus (GiBV) proviral
genome.
Results: Eighteen of ~24 GiBV viral segment sequences are encoded by 7 non-overlapping sets of BAC clones, revealing
that some proviral segment sequences are separated by long stretches of intervening DNA. Two overlapping BACs, which
contain a locus of 8 tandemly arrayed proviral segments flanked on either side by ~35 kbp of non-packaged DNA, were
sequenced and annotated. Structural and compositional analyses of this cluster revealed it exhibits a G+C and nucleotide
composition distinct from the flanking DNA. By analyzing sequence polymorphisms in the 8 GiBV viral segment sequences,
we found evidence for widespread selection acting on both protein-coding and non-coding DNA. Comparative analysis of
viral and proviral segment sequences revealed a sequence motif involved in the excision of proviral genome segments
which is highly conserved in two other bracoviruses.
Conclusion: Contrary to current concepts of bracovirus proviral genome organization our results demonstrate that
some but not all GiBV proviral segment sequences exist in a tandem array. Unexpectedly, non-coding DNA in the 8
proviral genome segments which typically occupies ~70% of BV viral genomes is under selection pressure suggesting it
serves some function(s). We hypothesize that selection acting on GiBV proviral sequences maintains the genetic islandlike nature of the cluster of proviral genome segments described herein. In contrast to large differences in the predicted
gene composition of BV genomes, sequences that appear to mediate processes of viral segment formation, such as proviral
segment excision and circularization, appear to be highly conserved, supporting the hypothesis of a single origin for BVs.

Background
Much recent attention in genomics has focused on bacterial endosymbionts of insects, including the ubiquitous
Wolbachia [1,2], the sap-feeder symbionts Buchnera, Baumannia, and Sulcia [3-5], and several others [6-8]. Many of
these symbionts bring unique metabolic capabilities to
their hosts, allowing these insects to flourish on diets
which otherwise would be difficult to utilize. Less attention has been given to viral endosymbionts. Bracoviruses
(BVs) and ichnoviruses (IVs) form subgroups of polydnaviruses (PDVs) that have evolved as obligate endosymbionts of braconid and ichneumonid endoparasitoid wasps,
respectively, and appear to provide their primary hosts
with pathogenic abilities [9]. Endoparasitoid wasps primarily parasitize other insects and usually kill the host
organism they develop in. Most endoparasitoid wasps,
including those that house PDVs, utilize a particularly difficult developmental strategy, known as koinobioncy,
whereby the host continues to develop after it has been
parasitized. Wasp eggs therefore begin development in a
hostile environment in which they come under attack
from the host's immune system. PDVs disrupt these
responses.
Members of Polydnaviridae represent the only known
viruses with segmented double-stranded DNA genomes
[9]. They exist in two forms: as an asymptomatic proviral
form integrated into the genome of male and female
wasps [10-13], and as virions. Proviral DNA is amplified
from wasp genomic DNA, and viral genome segments are
excised, circularized, and packaged into virus particles
only within specialized ovarian calyx cells of females [1416]. Virions are released into the reproductive tract and do
not appear to cause any ill effects. During oviposition, virions, along with wasp eggs and other factors, are injected
into a secondary host, usually a caterpillar, where viral
gene expression facilitates endoparasitoid survival by disrupting secondary host immunity, physiology, and development [17-19]. Additional wasp factors such as venom,
ovarian proteins, and egg-associated teratocytes may contribute to parasitism success. Virus particles do not replicate within the secondary (or primary) host, yet viralmediated pathology ensures perpetuation of the proviral
form of the virus within the parasitoid life cycle.
PDVs are involved in a highly successful triad of mutualistic-parasitic relationships: it is estimated that there are
over 30,000 wasp-PDV associations, with each wasp species exhibiting specific preferences in the host range they
parasitize [20]. Drawing parallels from mitochondrial and
bacterial endosymbiont genome evolution, some have
hypothesized that PDVs are the product of reductive viral
evolution [19,21]. Viral terminology is used to describe
PDVs, although many unusual aspects of their biology
have called into question this classification. Eukaryote-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/61

like genome properties and functional similarities
between some PDV genes and components of wasp ovarian fluid have led to the suggestion that PDVs are not
viruses at all, but rather represent genetic delivery vehicles
that have acquired a virus-like packaging system and have
evolved to transfer wasp parasitism genes to the lepidopteran host [22-24]. The evolutionary history of PDVs is
further obscured by the hypothesis that, despite gross similarities in form and function, BVs and IVs have evolved
independently [25,26]. Bracoviruses, however, are
thought to be monophyletic, as all bracovirus-bearing
wasps form a clade which originated ~74 million years
ago [25].
To date six PDV viral genomes have been sequenced:
CcBV and MdBV, BVs associated with the braconid wasps
Cotesia congregata and Microplitis demolitor, respectively,
and CsIV, HfIV, and TrIV, IVs associated with the ichneumonids Campoletis sonorensis, Hyposoter fugitivus, and Tranosema rostrale [24,27,28]. The sixth sequenced PDV, which
is associated with the banchine ichneumonid Glypta fumiferanae, is hypothesized to form a third independent lineage of PDVs [29]. The packaged genomes of these viruses
consist of between 15 and 105 circular segments and have
aggregate sizes ranging from 189 to 568 Kbp. Unlike typical viruses only 17–30% of the viral genomes code for
proteins, many genes are predicted to contain introns, and
no genes code for obvious components of a DNA replication or transcription machinery. Thus, host enzymes may
be utilized during construction of virus particles and/or
viral genes may constitute part of proviral sequences
which do not get packed into virus particles. In CsIV there
is evidence for partitioning of genes encoding protein
components of the virus particle between packaged and
non-packaged genomic DNA [30,31], although no similar
example has been shown for BVs. Compartmentalization
of genes that are needed to maintain the PDV life cycle
complicates study of virus biology and raises questions on
the definition of sequences that constitute a PDV proviral
genome.
While PDV viral genomes are better characterized, information on proviral genomes is limited. Studies on the
location of proviral genome segment sequences in CsIV
suggest that IV proviral genomes are integrated at multiple
loci in the wasp genome [32]. By contrast, it is thought
that BV proviral genome segments are tandemly arrayed
in a single locus and separated by short intervening
sequences [12,33-35]. The latter hypothesis is based on
studies of CcBV and CiBV in which proviral genome segments were flanked, at least on one end, by a different
proviral genome segment [12,33] and a fluorescent in situ
hybridization mapping study in which probes from three
different CcBV viral genome segments hybridized to the
same region of a single wasp chromosome [35].

The current model for production of BV viral segment
sequences is that one or more large precursor molecules
encompassing multiple proviral viral genome segments
are excised from genomic DNA and amplified, and this
DNA forms the substrate from which viral segments are
excised [34,36,37]. According to studies of CcBV and CiBV
(BV associated with Chelonus inanitus), all amplification of
BV DNA occurs at the level of the precursor molecule–no
amplification occurs following excision of viral genome
segments [34,36,37]. The DNA sequence at the segmental
boundaries of a limited number of proviral genome segments of CsIV, CiBV and CcBV have been studied
[11,33,38-40], and, in each, a direct DNA sequence repeat
occurs at the boundaries. Proviral genome segment
sequences are excised from the precursor molecules at
these repeats, possibly via conservative site-specific
recombination, and a single copy of the repeat is retained
within the circularized viral segment [12]. Additionally,
genome segments are packaged into virus particles in different abundances [28,33,40,41]. Recent semi-quantitative studies have shown large differences in copy number
in both viral (MdBV and CiBV) and proviral (CiBV only)
forms of segments [40,42]. The details of this phenomenon and its relationship to amplification and excision are
unknown.
Here we describe the analyses of a 223 kbp section of
genomic DNA from the braconid Glyptapanteles indiensis
which parasitizes gypsy moth. This region contains 8 proviral genome segments of G. indiensis Bracovirus (GiBV).
Our data provide new insight into BV proviral genome
structure, as not all GiBV viral genome segment sequences
are linked in a single tandem array in the wasp genome.
Conserved DNA sequences identified at the junctions of
GiBV proviral genome segment sequences and in GiBV,
CcBV and MdBV viral segments suggest that sequence
motifs governing segment excision are highly conserved
across bracoviruses. Analyses of GiBV viral segment
sequence polymorphism data indicate that widespread
selection acts on non-coding DNA, suggesting additional
functional motifs or non-coding RNAs are present in the
GiBV viral genome. Finally, there is a marked difference in
nucleotide composition between proviral segment
sequences and flanking DNA that is not packaged into
virus particles.

Results
Partial sequence characterization of GiBV viral DNA
Viral DNA was subjected to whole genome shotgun
sequencing using purified virus pooled from the calyx
fluid of ~400 female wasps from an outbred population.
As judged by sizing on agarose gels, the GiBV viral genome
was expected to contain 13 segments with a genome size
of ~250 kbp [41]. However, assembly of our preliminary
sequence data indicate an aggregate genome size of ~490

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/61

kbp and ~24 different segments. Many segments are of
similar sizes and would have co-migrated on agarose gels.
A high frequency of single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) (~1/70 bp) and insertions and deletions (indels) in
the DNA of the viral population that was sampled complicated the closure phase of the sequencing project. Nevertheless, 19 of the 24 preliminary viral genome segment
sequences were of sufficient quality to allow development
of segment-specific PCR primers (data not shown). These
primers were used to determine the proviral genome segment composition of BAC clones that hybridized with
32P-labeled GiBV viral DNA. Priority was given to closing
sequence and physical gaps in 8 viral genome segments
that were encoded by two overlapping BAC clones (see
below). A consensus sequence was generated for each viral
genome segment (see Materials and Methods), and the
resulting sequences, which varied in length from 10 to 26
kbp, were deposited in GenBank (EF051505–EF051512).
Individual sequence reads were deposited in the NCBI
Trace Archive (1472627677-1472629890).
Identification of BAC clones containing GiBV proviral DNA
Radioactive probes derived from total GiBV viral DNA
hybridized at varying intensity to 127 clones from a BAC
library of 9,216 clones made from the larvae of G. indiensis. Nineteen viral genome segment-specific PCRs were
used to genotype 60 BAC clones to determine the proviral
genome segment composition. These BAC clones segregated into 7 sets that contained non-overlapping profiles
of viral genome segments (Table 1). Each set contained 1
to 7 proviral genome segments, and in total 17 of the 19
proviral genome segments were identified. Additionally, a
sub-set of 30 BAC clones were fingerprinted using EcoRI

clones.

Non-overlapping sets of proviral genome segments found in BAC
clones, arbitrarily designated as set 1–7, are shown in column 1. The
second column shows the number of proviral genome segments
identified in each set. The third column shows the number of BACs
which tested positive for that set, and the fourth column shows the
number of BACs that were tested for that set. Some segment sets
were tested for on less than 60 BAC clones, as once multiple clones
were identified for a set of proviral genome segments, the primer
pairs representing those sets of segments were removed from PCR
experiments to reduce the number of PCRs needed to identify the
entire proviral genome.

repeat regions (solid black squares) are labeled L1R1 and L1R2, and their structure is shown in the open boxes as black boxes

and the resulting restriction enzyme patterns were used to
place the BAC clones into overlapping contigs. This
method of clustering was consistent with the results of the
segment-specific PCRs (data not shown).
Structure and composition of GiBV proviral locus 1
Two overlapping BAC clones that appeared to code for a
cluster of 7 proviral genome segments were selected for
sequencing. BAC clones 18I8 and 20D14 were 120,708
kbp and 116,222 kbp in length, respectively, and overlapped by 14,273 bp. The region of sequence overlap contained 53 SNPs, indicating the BAC clones were derived
from different individuals from a population of G. indiensis. A contiguous DNA sequence was generated by fusing
positions 1–109,055 of clone 18I8 with positions 2,560–
116,222 of clone 20D14, resulting in a region spanning
222,657 bp. The annotated DNA sequence was deposited
in GenBank (AC191960).

The coordinates of the 7 proviral genome segment
sequences in this region were determined by aligning viral
genome segment sequences to it. A search of the BAC
sequences against the entire assembly of viral genome segment shotgun sequence data led to the identification and
closure of an extra viral genome segment sequence. This
assembly was not of high enough quality for primer

design during the BAC clone screening phase. Thus, a cluster of 8 proviral genome segments labeled 1p to 8p separated by 7 inter-segmental regions (isg1 to isg7) that vary
in length from 122 bp to 8.4 kbp occupies ~163 kbp of
DNA which we call GiBV proviral locus 1. Interestingly,
the 34 kbp and 25 kbp region of DNA that flank locus 1
contain a 6–7 kbp section of DNA (L1R1 and L1R2) consisting primarily of non-coding tandem DNA sequence
repeats (Figure 1, Table 2).
A variety of nucleotide compositional differences exist
between the flanking regions I-IV, inter-segmental
regions, and proviral genome segments. The latter
sequences and L1R1/L1R2 have the highest average G+C
content (37%), followed by the flanking regions (32%)
while the inter-segmental regions have the lowest G+C
content (26%). The difference in G+C content between
coding and non-coding DNA is greater in flanking regions
I-IV (44% vs. 28%) than in proviral genome segment
sequences (41% vs. 34%) (Table 2). Relative dinucleotide
frequencies which correct for background G+C composition were calculated for each region > 500 bp in length,
except L1R1 and L1R2 as tandemly repetitive sequences
have highly biased dinucleotide frequencies. Neighborjoining clustering of the distances derived from these data
(Figure 2) revealed that all of the proviral genome seg-

ments cluster together and have a highly similar dinucleotide composition, which is distinct from flanking DNA.
Regions I and IV clustered together and the most distantly
from proviral genome segments, whereas regions II and III
and the inter-segmental regions clustered between the
proviral genome segments and regions I and IV.
A conserved DNA sequence motif exists at proviral genome
segment junctions
Visual examination of the DNA sequence at the junctions
between GiBV proviral genome segments and inter-segmental regions led to the identification of a 6 bp direct
sequence repeat (AGCTTT), which is perfectly conserved
at 14 of the 16 junctions and has one nucleotide substitution at the remaining 2 junctions. Because this repeat is
encoded on the top DNA strand for 3 proviral genome
segments (1p, 3, p, and 5p) and the bottom DNA strand
for the remaining 5 proviral genome segments (2p, 4p,
6p, 7p, and 8p), the 5' and 3' boundaries of a proviral
genome segment were defined as the first and second copy
of the AGCTTT repeat relative to the sequence depicted in
Figure 1. The 16 junction sequences were separated into 5'
and 3' boundaries and searched using MEME, a motif discovery tool. An extended sequence motif centered on the
AGCTTT repeat was identified in each group of sequences.
The 5' and 3' motifs are different to each other and the 5'
motif is more conserved than the 3' motif. Conservation
of both motifs was greater and longer on the segmental
side of the excision site than on the inter-segmental side
(Figure 3).

MEME analysis of the 8 GiBV viral genome segment
sequences revealed the presence of a single copy of the
AGCTTT repeat surrounded by a recombined motif from
the 5' and 3' motifs (Figure 3). By comparing proviral and
viral genome segment sequences, it was determined that
the two nucleotide polymorphisms present in the
AGCTTT repeat of the proviral genome segment sequences
appeared in the single copy of the repeat in viral genome
segment sequences. Specifically, the 5' repeat of segment
5p has a substitution at the fifth position while the 3'
repeat of segment 3p has a substitution at the first position and both changes occur in the corresponding viral
segment.
MEME was also used to search the complete CcBV and
MdBV viral genomes, and the 5 available viral genome
segments of CiBV. A sequence motif highly similar to the
recombined GiBV segment motif was found in all 30
CcBV viral genome segments and 13 out of 15 MdBV viral
genome segments (Figure 3). No similar motif was found
in CiBV, although described CiBV exision sites show conservation of varying degrees to the AGCTTT repeat
[33,40].
Annotation of proviral locus 1 and flanking DNA
Two previously described GiBV cDNAs (p325 and p494)
expressed in infected gypsy moth larvae [41] which
encode hypothetical proteins map to multiple genes in
proviral locus 1. These cDNAs provide direct evidence for
the presence of 1 and 2 introns in the p325 and p494 gene

families, respectively; p494 maps to 2 genes in proviral
genome segment 2p, while p325 maps to 1 gene of proviral genome segment 3p, 4p, and 5p. The shortest and
longest intron was 83 bp and 591 bp in length, respectively. Four variations of ab initio gene modeling programs
were tested for their ability to recover the correct intronexon structure of these 5 genes. A combination of Softberry's FGENESH trained on the honey bee (Apis mellifera)
and the Beijing Genome Institute's BGF trained on the
silkmoth (Bombyx mori) were most accurate and these programs, in addition to protein alignments generated with
the AAT package [43] were used to predict protein-coding
gene models (see Materials and Methods).
A total of 62 protein-coding genes were predicted to be
encoded within the 8 proviral genome segments (Table 2
and 3). As judged by sequence similarity using BLASTP, 47
genes have homologs in CcBV, but only 3 genes, all of
which are members of hypothetical family 4, have
homologs in MdBV. A TBLASTN analysis of the predicted
GiBV proteins against the MdBV and CcBV genomes
showed no additional similarity to MdBV. However, of
the 15 proteins which did not show BLASTP similarity to
CcBV, 5 showed similarity to translated CcBV sequences,
suggesting homologs of these genes may exist in CcBV but
were not previously predicted. The 10 remaining GiBV

Only 10 of the 62 predicted GiBV genes in the locus were
assigned a potential function, namely C-type lectins and
proteins containing a cystatin or ribonuclease T2 domain
(Table 3). Surprisingly, 50 genes were predicted to access
the secretory pathway as they contained a signal peptide
at the N-terminus. Of these 6 genes were predicted to have
trans-membrane domains, and 6 genes were predicted to
have potential glycosylphosphatidylinisotol anchors.
Only 3 proviral genome segment genes were not predicted
to contain introns and the remaining genes contain either
1 or 2 introns. A protein domain-based clustering pipeline
placed 43 of the 62 proteins into 14 gene families (see
Methods and Table 3). The distribution of members of
these gene families was generally not restricted to specific
proviral genome segments–8 gene families, including all
families with 4 members or more, were located on at least
2 non-adjoining proviral genome segments.
Regions L1R1 and L1R2 and the inter-segmental regions
were not predicted to contain protein-coding genes, nor
did these sequences produce any significant matches
when tested against the GenBank non-redundant protein
database using BLASTX (E = e-10). On the other hand,
regions I to IV were predicted to encode 9 genes and
potential function was assigned to 6 of them (Table 3).
These genes had a top blast hit to genes from Apis mellifera
(BLASTP, E < e-45), including the 5'-nucleotidase, trans-2enoyl-CoA reductase, hyaluronidase, N-myristoyltransferase, and 1 hypothetical protein. By contrast, none of
the genes encoded by the proviral genome segments had
any sequence similarity to A. mellifera (BLASTP, E = e-10),
other than proteins with conserved domains encoded in a
large number of genomes (e.g., the C-type lectin domain).
Four of 6 genes are encoded on A. mellifera chromosome
14, although only the honey bee hyaluronidase and Nmyristoyltransferase genes were located in close proximity
to each other.
Analysis of sequence polymorphisms in GiBV viral genome
segment sequences
Proviral genome segments in locus 1 share 99.5–99.9%
sequence identity with their homologous viral genome
segment sequence. The distribution of 2,159 SNPs in the
8 GiBV viral genome segment sequences relative to the
corresponding proviral genome segment sequence is
shown in Table 4. Viral genome segment 2 showed a low
frequency of polymorphisms, averaging ~5 SNPs/kbp,
while the remaining segments had an average SNP density
of ~16 SNPs/kbp. The majority of genome segments
showed no significant correlation between sequence coverage and SNP density (Table 4), with the exception of
segment 1, which showed a slight correlation (R2 = 0.25,

p < 0.05). All SNPs were placed in one of three classes:
non-coding, synonymous, and non-synonymous. As
expected, there was a significantly higher SNP density in
synonymous sites than non-synonymous sites (χ21 df =
37.3, p < 0.01). However, there was also a higher SNP
density in synonymous sites relative to non-coding sites
(χ21 df = 38.2, p < 0.01), and no difference in SNP density

between non-coding and non-synonymous sites (χ21 df =
1.8, p > 0.05).
The number of SNPs per gene ranged from 0 to 68, and
dN/dS ratios were calculated for the 39 out of 62 genes
that contained 5 or more SNPs (Table 3). Most of these
genes appear to be under purifying selection and 32 of 39

genes had dN/dS ratio < 0.8 with a majority of the ratios
falling in the range of 0.40–0.59 (Figure 4). Three genes
appear to be evolving neutrally (dN/dS = 0.8–1.2) and
code for 2 hypothetical proteins and 1 member of gene
family 3. Four genes had a dN/dS > 1.9, including 1 member each of gene families 1, 10, and 11 (the ribonuclease
T2 domain) and an EP1-like protein. No correlation was
found between dN/dS ratios and specific genome seg-

ments or gene families–most segments and gene families
contained genes under different degrees of selection.

Discussion
Not all GiBV proviral genome segments occur in a tandem
array
Prior to this study, it was believed that bracovirus proviral
genome segments were closely linked in a tandem array in

Page 9 of 17

BMC Microbiology 2007, 7:61

the wasp genome with short stretches of intervening DNA
separating them [12,33-35]. Our study indicates that this
is not the case for GiBV. While some GiBV proviral
genome segment sequences are clustered in tandem arrays
others occur in isolation as singletons. This conclusion is
supported by the segregation of BAC clones coding for 18
of ~24 proviral genome segments into 7 non-overlapping
sets of clones via viral genome segment-specific PCRs
(Table 1), and preliminary BAC shotgun sequence data
support the typing data (not shown). Furthermore,
although we describe a tandem array of proviral genome
segments in this paper at GiBV proviral locus 1, the array
codes for only 8 proviral genome segment sequences and
this cluster is flanked by at least 34 kbp and 25 kbp of
DNA (Figure 1) that is not packaged into GiBV virions. It
remains to be determined whether the 7 loci encoding
GiBV proviral segment sequences are linked on the same
chromosome as a macrolocus but with longer stretches of
intervening DNA between them, or whether they are dispersed across more than one chromosome. Although the
former scenario remains compatible with a study of C.
congregata where probes from 3 different viral genome
segments bound to the same location on C. congregata
chromosome 5 [35], the structural organization of BV
proviral genome segment sequences appears to be more
complex than previously hypothesized.
It is reasonable to propose that the inter-segmental
regions in GiBV proviral locus 1 should be classified as
part of the GiBV proviral genome. However, to what
extent the proviral genome extends into flanking DNA is
less easily determined. BV viral genome segments are
thought to be excised from the amplified products of one
or more large precursor molecules, and there is no evidence for post-excision amplification of segments
[34,36,37]. Thus copy number studies of regions immediately flanking GiBV proviral locus 1 and other loci containing proviral genome segment sequences at the time of
viral genome segment formation could be used as a surrogate marker for identifying potential components of the
GiBV proviral genome.
Gene content of proviral locus 1 and flanking regions
Due to the limited transcriptional data available for BVs,
there is substantial disagreement on the structural complexity of BV genes, particularly with regards to the percentage of PDV genes that contain introns. While Espagne
et al [24] predicted that 69% of CcBV proteins contain
introns, Webb et al [28] re-annotated the CcBV genome
and predicted only 6.8% of CcBV genes contain introns–a
ten-fold difference in intron content. In GiBV proviral
locus 1, using a combination of Hymenoptera- and Lepidoptera-trained gene prediction programs (see Methods),
we predicted that 81% of the 63 genes contain introns.
Sequence data from 2 cDNAs derived from genes in provi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/61

ral locus 1 suggests that the 7 introns predicted for 5 members of the 2 gene families are real and not artifacts of
improper gene modeling. However, this number is probably not reflective of the entire GiBV genome, as PTP and
ankyrin genes usually do not contain introns [44-46] and
generally comprise a large percentage of BV genes (21%
and 41% of predicted CcBV and MdBV genes, respectively), but are not present in GiBV proviral locus 1.
Regardless, the accuracy of most predicted gene models
awaits experimental verification. While the presence of
introns may be unusual for virus genes, some DNA viruses
which replicate in the host cell nucleus encode genes with
introns (e.g., adenoviruses [47]).
GiBV genes in proviral locus 1 predicted to contain
introns have an extremely simple intron-exon structure
compared to often complex higher eukaryotic genes, and
generally contain a single short exon followed by a long
exon encoding the remainder of the protein. Remarkably,
80% of the genes at this locus, including the p494 and
p325 gene families which are transcribed in infected gypsy
moth larvae, are predicted to encode a secretion signal
peptide within the first exon. Secretion of some proteins
may compensate for differences in the abundance of segment sequences in virions. Since it is unclear whether the
entirety of the GiBV genome is packaged into a single virion [41], secretion of a large number of proteins may be
necessary for properly delivery of these proteins. Attempts
to functionally annotate the 62 predicted genes in the 8
GiBV proviral genome segment sequences identified the
presence of a C-type lectin [48], CrV1-like proteins [49],
and a number of conserved hypothetical proteins
encoded by other PDV genomes [19,24,26,50]. Most of
the genes in locus 1 were predicted to have homologs in
CcBV, while only gene family 4 showed homology to a
gene on MdBV segment B. Although the function of this
gene family is unknown, it is the only gene family in GiBV
proviral locus 1 for which none of the members are predicted to contain signal peptides.
The placement of 43 GiBV genes into 14 gene families suggests that extensive duplication of genes has occurred
within proviral locus 1. Typically, gene duplications are
thought to result in relaxation of the selection on the
duplicated gene, allowing it to acquire a new function.
However, the majority of genes in proviral locus 1, even
multiple members of the same gene family, appear to be
under purifying selection (Figure 4). This implies that
members of gene families are, for the most part, not free
to acquire entirely new functions but may play different
roles within the constraints of their gene family, such as
differential targeting as seen in some inhibitors of NF-κBs
[45] or differential expression as seen in some PTPs [46].
Alternatively, conserved function across duplicated genes
may be important for increasing the level of expression of

functional classes of genes [26,51]. Despite the large proportion of genes under purifying selection, 7 genes appear
to be evolving neutrally or under diversifying selection,
potentially allowing a limited set of genes to acquire new
functions or adapt to changes in host defenses.

# genes

The inter-segmental regions which separate the proviral
genome segments are not predicted to contain protein
coding genes. However, regions that map outside of proviral locus 1 are predicted to contain 9 genes, and potential function has been assigned to some of them, e.g., Nmyristoyltransferase, ecto-5'-nucleotidase, and hyaluronidase (Figure 1). It is interesting to note that viral proteins
are often modified with a lipid tail, hyaluronidase is a
component of venom [52] that hydrolyzes complex carbohydrate structures allowing tissue diffusion, and ecto5'-nucleotidase is involved in the extracellular formation
of adenosine, a regulator of innate immune responses
[53,54]. It is unclear whether these regions constitute part
of the GiBV proviral genome but there is a striking differ-

ence in the structural complexity of these predicted gene
models and those present in proviral locus 1. Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that proteins encoded in
the flanking regions, perhaps as components of ovarian
fluids, and genes that are located close to other proviral
segment loci, may play a role in GiBV biology. Also notable is a sex-linked wasp gene coding for a homolog of
female-lethal(2) [fl(2)d] that is present in region I. In Drosophila fl(2)d plays a critical role in alternative splicing regulation of genes involved in sex determination (including
Sex-lethal and transformer), dosage compensation, oogenesis, and differentiation, as well as non sex-specific functions, and is expressed throughout larval and adult life
[55-58]. Since excision of proviral genome segments from
the wasp chromosome and encapsidation into virion particles occurs only in females, it is possible that regulation
of this sex-linked process is related, at least in part, to
expression of fl(2)d.
A proviral genome segment excision motif is highly
conserved across bracoviruses
The presence of a near perfect AGCTTT direct DNA
sequence repeat was discovered at the boundaries of proviral genome segment sequences and flanking sequences
(Figure 3). As the viral genome segment sequences contain a single copy of this repeat, it appears to define the
site of proviral genome segment excision. This suggests an
excision mechanism via conservative site specific recombination as described for formation of other PDV genome
segments [12,33,39]. The presence of two SNPs within
this repeat at the junction of proviral segment sequences
and the ability to follow these nucleotide differences from
the proviral to the viral genome segments suggests that the
site of proviral genome segment excision and circularization must be located between the first and fifth position
within the AGCTTT repeat (Figure 3). A study of excision
sites in CiBV similarly concluded that GCT was the preferred site of excision [40].

BMC Microbiology 2007, 7:61

An extended but different sequence motif around the excision site was identified at the 5' and 3' proviral genome
segment junction sequences using MEME and the recombined sequence motif is found on viral genome segment
sequences (Figure 3). While sequence conservation exists
on both sides of excision sites, a higher level of conservation is seen in the side of the motif which is retained in circularized segment, and in particular at the 5' junction. The
asymmetry of the 5' and 3' sequence motifs suggests that
there is directionality to the recognition of excision sites.
Since recombined sites have a different motif we predict
they are no longer substrates for the excision enzymes.
Excision and circularization of segments from a large precursor molecule could occur via release of single segments
or a smaller molecule containing multiple segments. In
the latter case the segments flanking the site of circularization would no longer be available for excision. For example, if a molecule encompassing 1p through 3p in proviral
locus 1 were excised, only 2p would remain a substrate for
subsequent excision and circularization (Figure 1). Such a
pathway could contribute to differences in the abundance
of packaged viral genome segments but it portrays a complex scenario. Assuming that sequence coverage of a viral
genome segment in our shotgun sequencing approach
correlates with the abundance of the segment it is interesting to note that the GiBV viral genome segments encoded
in proviral locus 1 appear to be present in about the same
levels (Table 4), suggesting that generation of intermediate excision products is not a common occurrence. The
sequencing data also suggest that intermediates or byproducts of excision, if they occur, are excluded from the
packaging process, perhaps by the presence of inter-segmental DNA.
We found that the predicted site of excision/circularization and the recombined extended motif present in GiBV
viral genome segments is also present in CcBV and MdBV
viral genome segments (Figure 3). Conservation of the
GCT portion of the excision repeat sequence exists in the
CiBV viral genome segment sequences that are available
[40], although more CiBV sequences will be required to
determine how closely the CiBV extended motif mirrors
that of GiBV, CcBV, and MdBV. As C. congregata, G. indiensis, and M. demolitor are all members of Microgasterinae,
the most derived clade of bracovirus-bearing braconids,
and C. inanitus is a member of Cheloninae, the most basal
clade of the bracovirus-bearing wasps [59,60], it is possible that the predicted excision motif is one of the very few
sequence features that is highly conserved across bracoviruses, and provides additional support for the hypothesis
that bracoviruses have a single evolutionary origin
[20,60]. This observation also predicts conservation of the
enzyme(s) involved in BV proviral genome segment excision and circularization.

Analysis of SNP data derived from sequencing the GiBV
viral genome from an outbred population of female
wasps revealed that non-coding sites in the 8 viral genome
segments derived from locus 1 had a significantly lower
SNP density than synonymous sites within coding DNA.
As we presume synonymous sites to be evolving neutrally,
this result suggest that there is likely to be selective pressure on non-coding DNA. The lack of difference between
rates of change at non-coding and non-synonymous sites
suggests that in these segment sequences, non-coding
DNA may be as highly conserved as coding DNA. Such
areas could encode non-coding RNAs or contain sequence
motifs vital to DNA replication, gene expression or segment packaging. Limited experimental evidence support
the idea that PDV non-coding DNA is functional–studies
of CsIV segment B found 2 sequences of 0.6 and 1.2 kbp
which are transcribed but do not encode proteins [61,62].
Proviral locus 1–a genetic island?
Several differences between the cluster of 8 GiBV proviral
segment sequences which are excised and packed into
virus particles and flanking DNA suggest that proviral segment sequences are not simply host genetic elements
evolved for the export of wasp parasitism genes. For example, the proviral segments exhibit similar nucleotide compositions to each other but their G+C composition and
dinucleotide frequencies differ from those of inter-segmental regions and flanking regions I-IV (Table 2 and Figure 2). Given the estimated age of the integration of
bracoviruses into the wasp genome, ~74 million years,
and using substitution rates estimated from Drosophila
[63], one would predict that a sufficient period of time has
passed for the process of ameliorization, i.e., the adjustment over time of the nucleotide composition of the integrated DNA to that of the resident genome [64], to have
occurred. The different nucleotide composition of the
proviral segment sequences may be maintained or its
ameliorization may be slowed by the purifying selection
found to be acting on both non-coding and coding DNA.
However, as differences in nucleotide composition can be
caused by different origins of DNA [64] or by the widespread purifying selection itself [65], the origins of the
compositional differences between proviral and flanking
DNA remain to be determined. Additionally, it is possible
that inter-segmental and flanking regions, rather than the
proviral segment sequences, differ from the remainder of
the wasp genome.

Conclusion
Here we provide the first report of a 223 kbp region of
genomic DNA from the braconid Glyptapanteles indiensis,
and the characterization of a cluster of 8 proviral genome
segments encoded within it. Our data show that, contrary

to current concepts of bracovirus proviral genome organization, the proviral segments are not entirely contained
within a single tandem array in the wasp genome. However, it remains unclear whether the multiple GiBV proviral loci are linked on a single wasp chromosome as a
macrolocus, and how representative this pattern is of BVs
as a whole. The dispersed nature of GiBV proviral genome
segments raises the question as to how to define proviral
DNA within the wasp genome. It is reasonable to propose
that sequences which can be shown to be physically
linked to proviral genome segment sequences within
amplified precursor molecules should be classified as part
of the proviral genome. Whether such studies will reveal
the entire composition of a proviral genome remains to be
determined, as it is not known whether all genes involved
in virion formation are components of precursor molecules.
Our study provides, for the first time, evidence for widespread purifying selection acting on BV non-coding DNA,
suggesting that a large amount of the non-coding DNA in
bracoviral genomes may be functional. Our analysis also
reveals a variety of notable differences between flanking
and proviral genome segment sequences. We hypothesize
that selection acting on proviral DNA is maintaining the
distinctive nucleotide composition of the proviral
genome. However, the origins of these differences remain
unknown. Neither proviral locus 1 nor any of the BV viral
genomes sequenced to date encode homologs of known
viral coat proteins or components of a transcription or
DNA replication machinery, which are often the only
genes conserved enough for viral phylogenetic studies.
Identification of genes that perform these functions in
Glyptapanteles indiensis will be essential for determining
whether GiBV has a viral or cellular origin. As multiple
lines of evidence, including the conserved excision motif
described herein, support the hypothesis of a single evolutionary origin of BVs, an understanding of the evolutionary history of GiBV will reveal much about the evolution
of BVs as a whole.

hr according to established protocol [66]. G. indiensis parasitize late first instar gypsy moth larvae. Cocoons formed
from parasitized hosts were stored at 24°C until adult parasitoid emergence and then separated by sex. G. indiensis
larvae were dissected from parasitized host 10 days post
parasitization, briefly rinsed in phosphate buffered saline
(PBS), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored frozen at
-80°C.
Virion purification and DNA extraction
Virions were purified from G. indiensis females using
established protocols [67]. Briefly, female wasps were
anaesthetized in 75% ethanol and rinsed in PBS. Ovaries
were dissected from the females in a drop of PBS and ruptured, draining the calyx fluid. Pooled calyx fluid was subsequently filtered through a 0.45 μm filter to remove eggs
and cellular debris [68]. Viral DNA was extracted according to established protocol [41]. Briefly, viral DNA was
isolated from the calyx fluid using a proteinase K/SDS
buffer, DNA was extracted with phenol, precipitated with
ethanol, and recovered by centrifugation.
Identification of BAC clones containing proviral DNA
A BAC library of G. indiensis with a 120 kb average insert
size was constructed by Amplicon Express [69], using a
partial BamHI digest inserted into an MboI site of a
pECBAC1 vector. A nylon filter arrayed with 9,216 BAC
clones was created from the library. In order to identify
BAC clones containing proviral DNA, GiBV viral DNA was
radioactively labeled with 32P-labeled α-dCTP (NEN/Perkin-Elmer) using the Redi-prime II DNA labeling kit
(Amersham Biosciences). Labeled DNA was then purified
using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The filter
was pre-hybridized at 65° for at least 3 hours with Rapidhyb Buffer (Amersham Biosciences) and 500 μg of salmon
testes DNA (denatured at 100°C, Sigma-Aldritch). The
probe was added and allowed to hybridize overnight at
65°C. The filter was then washed 2 times for 60 minutes
each at 65°C with a 0.1 × SSC/0.1% SDS solution,
wrapped in plastic wrap, and autoradiographed using
Kodac BioMax MS film.

Methods
Rearing of parasitoid wasps
Outbred populations of Glyptapanteles indiensis, solitary
endoparasitoids of gypsy moths (Lymantria dispar), were
maintained at the USDA-ARS-Beneficial Insects Introduction Research Unit, Newark, Delaware, as part of a biocontrol program. The colony was founded in May 1998 from
a shipment of 168 moths collected from 4 localities in
India. In May 2002, the colony was outcrossed with 242
moths collected from the same localities. The mean colony size was 400 with an average sex ratio of 7 females:13
males. Host larvae were fed on a high wheat-germ diet.
Both wasp and host larvae were maintained at 26°C, 58%
relative humidity, and a light-dark (L:D) cycle of 16L:8D

BAC DNA preparation and fingerprinting
BAC clones were grown in 5 mL LB with 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol overnight at 37°C and shaking at 200 rpm.
BAC DNA was extracted using the Sigma Phaseprep BAC
DNA Kit (Sigma-Aldritch) without the endotoxin removal
step. BAC DNA was digested with EcoRI (Invitrogen) in a
1:150 dilution of RNase cocktail (Sigma Phaseprep Kit) at
37°C for 2 hours. Digested DNA was run overnight on a
1.2% agarose gel, stained with Vistra Green and imaged
using a FluorImager SI (Amersham Biosciences). Gel
images were processed using Image [70], and contigs were
assembled using FingerPrintContig [71] using the default
e-value of e-10.

GiBV and BAC clone sequencing
Approximately 7.5 μg of GiBV DNA was sheared and DNA
fragments in the size range of 3.5–4.5 kbp purified after
separation by agarose gel electrophoresis. The fragments
were blunt ended and, after addition of BstXI adaptors,
cloned into the BstXI site of pHOS2. Shotgun libraries
were made from the 2 BAC clones as described for GiBV
DNA. Celera Assembler [72] and TIGR Assembler [73]
were used to assemble random sequence data from the
viral whole genome shotgun and BAC clones, respectively.
Gap closure was assisted by a closure editor tool called
Cloe that also permits the manual inspection and editing
of sequence data. A variety of methods were used to close
gaps including re-sequencing the ends of random clones,
transposon assisted sequencing (GPS, New England
Biolabs™) or "micro-library" construction of single or
pooled templates, and conversion of physical gaps to
sequence gaps using "POMP" (pipette optimal multiplex
PCR) [74] and or/a "Genome Walker" kit (Invitrogen™).
GiBV segment-specific PCRs
Primers were developed to be specific to 19 GiBV viral
genome segment sequences. Primers were designed to be
22–26 nt in length, have a Tm of 62–65°C, a GC clamp,
and a maximum identity to the remainder of the unclosed
GiBV genome of 70%. Designed primers were tested for
potential secondary structure using NetPrimer [75]. PCR
was performed in a 10 μl solution which included 0.1 μl
template DNA, 0.3 μl 50 mM MgCl2, 1 μl 10 × PCR buffer,
0.2 μ10 mM dNTPs, 7.9 μl H2O, 0.1 μl Platinum Taq (Invitrogen), 0.2 μl F primer (20 pm/μl), and 0.2 μl RC primer
(20 pm/μl). PCR protocol was 94° for 2 min; 35 cycles of
94° for 30 sec, 58° for 30 sec, 72° for 45 sec; followed by
72° for 7 min.
Derivation of consensus GiBV segment sequences
As shotgun sequencing of the GiBV DNA was carried out
using a sample pooled from a population of ~400 wasps,
a large number of SNPs and indels were present in the
sequence assembly. Because individual sequence reads
could not be associated with individual wasps, a conical
consensus sequence was generated for each viral genome
segment using the SliceTools package [76]. At a given
position in a conical consensus, all bases with a cumulative quality value within 50% of the highest cumulative
quality value are assigned to that position.
Annotation
Gene models were generated with a variety of software:
Softberry's FGENESH [77] using both the honey bee (Apis
mellifera) and fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) training
sets, the Beijing Genome Institute's BGF [78] trained on
the silkmoth (Bombyx mori), and GENSCAN [79] using the
vertebrate training set. Predicted gene models were compared to gene models generated using cDNA from 2 gene

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/61

families for their ability to predict correct intron-exon
structure. Most of the gene finders accurately predicted the
2 intron structure of the p494 genes, with the exception of
GENSCAN which predicted an extra exon. The single
intron in p325 genes were significantly more difficult to
predict – only FGENESH (A. mellifera) and BGF properly
predicted these genes. FGENESH (D. melanogaster) and
GENSCAN both mis-predicted the majority of intronexon boundaries and showed a tendency to combine multiple genes into single genes with a large number of
introns. Based on these results, a combination of
FGENESH (A. mellifera) and BGF was used for gene prediction, in addition to the AAT package [43] which allows
spliced alignment of proteins to genomic DNA thereby
revealing potential exon-intron boundaries. Gene models
from FGENESH were generally accepted except when multiple other sources of information contradicted those
models. SignalP [80,81], TM-HMM [82], and GPI-SOM
[83], were used to predict signal peptides, transmembrane
domains, and glycosylphosphatidylinisotol anchors,
respectively. Predicted genes were clustered into gene families using previously described methods [84], which utilize Pfam [85] and TIGRFAM [86] domains and calculate
novel shared domains within the genome. Predicted GiBV
proviral segment genes were analyzed for potential
homology to genes in CcBV and MdBV and CsIV using
BLASTP (CcBV only) and TBLASTN (CcBV and MdBV),
with a cutoff of E = e-10.
Nucleotide composition analysis
Relative dinucleotide frequencies [87], were calculated for
each region > 500 bp in length except the flanking repeats,
as they are expected to have highly biased dinucleotide
frequencies. A Euclidean distance matrix between the
regions was constructed from these frequencies. Regions
were then clustered using the Neighbor-joining algorithm
in PAUP* [88] and the resulting tree was visualized using
PHY·FI [89].
Motif analysis
Boundaries between the proviral segments and inter-segmental regions, and the inter-segmental regions themselves were analyzed for motifs using MEME [90]. In the
first analysis a 103 bp DNA sequence (50 bp upstream to
50 bp downstream of the GCT excision motif) was
extracted from each segmental boundary. The boundaries
of proviral segments 1p, 3p, and 5 bp were reverse complemented so that orientation of the excision motif was
the same for all sequences. All 16 sequences were analyzed together, and then split into 8 5' (upstream) and 8
3' (downstream) motifs relative to the directionality of the
excision motif. Next, an analysis was conducted using the
entire length of the 7 inter-segmental regions. Analyses
used a minimal and maximal motif length of 5 and 100
bp, respectively. MEME was also used to search 30 CcBV

[Genbank :AJ632304–AJ632333], 15 MdBV [Genbank:AY887894, AY875680–AY875690, AY848690,
AY842013, DQ000240], and 5 CiBV viral genome segments [Genbank :AJ627175, AJ278677, AJ319654,
Z58828, Z31378] for common motifs. All motifs were visualized using WebLogo [91,92].
SNP analysis
Ambiguous consensus sequences were generated from the
viral genome sequence by recalling contigs so that all high
quality (quality value > = 30) base calls in the reads were
represented in the new consensus as ambiguity codes.
This ensured all variants of a given circle were encoded
within a single consensus sequence, while preventing low
quality sequencing error from introducing artificial polymorphisms. Then, the ambiguous viral genome segment
consensus sequences were globally aligned to their corresponding proviral genome segment sequences using nucmer from the MUMmer package [93]. This alignment was
parsed to determine the positions of all polymorphisms
relative to the reference proviral sequence, including both
substitutions and indels. Substitutions were found by
mismatches in the alignment between the viral consensus
sequence and proviral reference sequence. The distribution of polymorphisms was analyzed using the gene-snps
tool from the AMOS package [94]. The tool examines each
polymorphism to determine if it occurs within an exon,
and if so, whether the change is synonymous or non-synonymous. Additionally, the tool estimates dN/dS for each
gene using the unweighted pathway method [95]. The
final analysis the tool performs is a test of independence
between SNP density and sequence coverage (i.e. if more
sequences covering any given position means that position is more likely to contain a polymorphism). To do so,
it computes the Pearson's correlation of the polymorphism rate and depth of coverage using a sliding window
of size 500 bp offset by 250 bp across each circle. Statistical significance of correlation coefficients were evaluated
using a 2-tailed t test, where degrees of freedom equals the
number of SNPs minus two. Differences between the relative number of substitutions of non-coding, synonymous, and non-synonymous sites were evaluated using
Pearson's χ2 test.
