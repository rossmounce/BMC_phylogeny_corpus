Abstract
Background: The Floral Genome Project was initiated to bridge the genomic gap between the
most broadly studied plant model systems. Arabidopsis and rice, although now completely
sequenced and under intensive comparative genomic investigation, are separated by at least 125
million years of evolutionary time, and cannot in isolation provide a comprehensive perspective on
structural and functional aspects of flowering plant genome dynamics. Here we discuss new
genomic resources available to the scientific community, comprising cDNA libraries and Expressed
Sequence Tag (EST) sequences for a suite of phylogenetically basal angiosperms specifically selected
to bridge the evolutionary gaps between model plants and provide insights into gene content and
genome structure in the earliest flowering plants.
Results: Random sequencing of cDNAs from representatives of phylogenetically important
eudicot, non-grass monocot, and gymnosperm lineages has so far (as of 12/1/04) generated 70,514
ESTs and 48,170 assembled unigenes. Efficient sorting of EST sequences into putative gene families

based on whole Arabidopsis/rice proteome comparison has permitted ready identification of cDNA
clones for finished sequencing. Preliminarily, (i) proportions of functional categories among
sequenced floral genes seem representative of the entire Arabidopsis transcriptome, (ii) many
known floral gene homologues have been captured, and (iii) phylogenetic analyses of ESTs are
providing new insights into the process of gene family evolution in relation to the origin and
diversification of the angiosperms.
Conclusion: Initial comparisons illustrate the utility of the EST data sets toward discovery of the
basic floral transcriptome. These first findings also afford the opportunity to address a number of
conspicuous evolutionary genomic questions, including reproductive organ transcriptome overlap
between angiosperms and gymnosperms, genome-wide duplication history, lineage-specific gene
duplication and functional divergence, and analyses of adaptive molecular evolution. Since not all
genes in the floral transcriptome will be associated with flowering, these EST resources will also be
of interest to plant scientists working on other functions, such as photosynthesis, signal
transduction, and metabolic pathways.

Background
The genome sequences of Arabidopsis [1] and rice [2,3]
have stimulated great advances throughout the plant sciences. Comparisons of these eudicot and monocot
genomes have provided many insights into the genome
characteristics and evolutionary histories of both lineages
[e.g. [4-6]], and comparisons involving additional species
are generating a more global picture of angiosperm
genome evolution [7-9].
These multispecies comparisons, and comparative plant
sciences more generally, have been aided by the well-supported understanding of evolutionary relationships
among flowering plants that has emerged over the last
decade [e.g. [10-13]]. Among the most noteworthy phylogenetic results is the well-supported inference that
whereas monocots form a clade, the dicots as traditionally
circumscribed do not. Rather, monocots are derived from
within the "primitive" dicot grade, now collectively
referred to as basal angiosperms (Fig. 1). The "eudicots"
(or "tricolpates" [14]; Fig. 1) do form a clade that comprises ca. 75% of all angiosperm species [15], and most of
this diversity is found among the "core" eudicots, which
include the rosids, asterids, and Caryophyllales (Fig. 1).
Model systems such as Arabidopsis thaliana, tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), cotton (Gossypium), poplar (Populus),
barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) and ice-plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum), are all representatives of the
core eudicot clade (Fig. 1). Rice (Oryza savita), maize (Zea
mays), wheat (Triticum aestivum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and sugarcane (Saccharum officinale) are all members of the grass family
(Poaceae), a phylogenetically derived lineage within the
monocots (Fig. 1). Although comparisons of the rice and
Arabidopsis genomes will undoubtedly identify many features of the ancestral angiosperm genome, this pair-wise
comparison alone will not be able to distinguish Arabidopsis-specific attributes from those specifically absent in rice

or visa versa. The recent posting of high coverage genome
sequence for Populus trichocarpa [16] is a major advance
for comparative plant genomics, but even Populus-Arabidopsis-rice comparisons cannot distinguish features common to all angiosperms from those that arose in the most
recent common ancestor of eudicots and monocots,
which existed at least 125 million years ago [17] and perhaps more than 140 million years ago [e.g. [18-20]]. In
general, the resolving power of comparative plant genomics will increase with additional taxa representing key lineages in plant phylogeny (Fig. 1). Increased genomic
resources for phylogenetically diverse plant species will
lead to a better understanding of plant genome evolution,
the diversification of gene families, and the origins of
reproductive characteristics common to all flowering
plants.
Basal angiosperms and basal eudicots (e.g., Ranunculales), while comprising a small percentage of the total
number of extant angiosperm species, nonetheless
encompass an astonishing spectrum of developmental
patterns and floral forms [21,22]. In turn, this diversity
provides a clear opportunity to reconstruct to the basal
condition of angiosperms, and thereby bridge the evolutionary gap between model eudicot and monocot
genomes. Understanding the evolution of angiosperm
genes and genomes, including the floral transcriptome,
requires three-way and higher-order comparisons that
extend beyond Arabidopsis and rice. This point is widely
appreciated, and comparative plant genomics is being
fueled by the availability of genomic resources for a growing number of plant species. The addition of species representing basal angiosperms, basal eudicot, and non-grass
monocot lineages will be especially valuable, not only for
flowering research, but also for more general "reconstructomic" studies of housekeeping and transcription factor
functions.

Well- supported evolutionary relationships among FGP species and other genomic models are shown in this phylogenic tree of
seed plants. Red taxon names indicate those species for which we aim to sequence 10,000 ESTs, green taxon names indicate
species for which we are sequencing 2000 ESTs, and blue taxon names indicate species for which large EST sets are already
available in public databases [24, 25, 28, 29, 61] or will soon become available [70].

A primary objective of the Floral Genome Project (FGP;
[23]) is to uncover patterns of conservation and divergence of the floral transcriptome among angiosperms,
particularly to elucidate the role of gene duplications and
shifting expression patterns in the origin and diversifica-

tion of angiosperms. The FGP has constructed a large collection of non-normalized nor tissue subtracted cDNA
libraries and 5' EST sets from developing reproductive tissues for selected species of basal eudicots, basal
angiosperms and gymnosperms (Table 1). These species

represent not only key nodes in the angiosperm phylogenetic tree and its sister group (gymnosperms), but also a
diversity of reproductive structures and developmental
patterns. While multi-species comparisons of large
sequence data sets are already possible for Poaceae [9,24]
Solanaceae [25], and Brassicaceae [7,26,27], the addition
of large EST sets for basal angiosperms opens the door to
fundamental comparative genomics investigations of the
origin and diversification of flowering plants.

Results
Random 5' sequencing of cDNAs from basal flowering
plants has so far (as of 12/01/04) generated 70,514 ESTs
assembled into 48,170 unique gene sequences (Table 1).
These materials should provide essential resources for
comparative genomic research because they represent pre-

viously poorly sampled genomes placed at crucial points
in angiosperm phylogeny. Gene sequences from the gymnosperm Welwitschia, the basalmost angiosperms Amborella and Nuphar, the basal monocot Acorus, the magnoliids
Persea, Liriodendron and Saruma, and the basal eudicot
Eschscholzia will aid in placing boundary dates on the origins of florally-expressed gene families, help resolve patterns of gene and genome evolution within the flowering
plants, and bridge critical gaps in comparative analyses
involving monocot and eudicot model systems. Identification of cDNA clones for finished sequencing has been
aided by efficient sorting of EST sequences into putative
gene families based on whole Arabidopsis/rice proteome
comparison. Phylogenetic analyses of ESTs are providing
new insights into the process of gene family evolution in
relation to the origin and diversification of the

PGN website
All FGP EST data and unigene builds are available through
the Plant Genome Network (PGN) website [28], linked

also through the FGP homepage [29]. PGN was designed
as a general-purpose EST analysis pipeline and web-based
database that can be readily employed as a "front end" for
other EST sequencing projects. PGN is a trace file database
accepting all standard automated sequencer file formats.
Quality information in the raw trace files is used for
sequence trimming and assembly, and chromatograms
can be visualized through the website. The focus on trace
file data distinguishes PGN from other EST databases such
as PlantGDB [30] and the TIGR Gene Indices [31]. PGN
also provides an EST processing and annotation service
for smaller EST projects that may not have the informatics
resources to generate a public database, and provides a
stable web address for these projects. PGN provides public
access to EST library statistics, unigene build details, EST
chromatograms, and permits FGP taxon-specific BLAST
[32] searches.
Tribe analysis
Tentative classification of unigenes has allowed us to
identify quickly the genes represented in our EST sets. We
created an objectively defined scaffold for classification
through cluster analysis of the Arabidopsis and rice proteomes. The PlantTribes database [33] can be searched
using BLAST, or by query with Arabidopsis or rice sequence
IDs [34], sequence annotations, Pfam accession IDs [35]
or keywords.

To construct PlantTribes, predicted protein sequences
from the Arabidopsis thaliana var. Columbia and Oryza
sativa var. japonica (rice) genomes were downloaded from
TIGR [34]. The BLASTP program [32] was used to compare all sequences to each other, and the similarity-based
clustering procedure TribeMCL [36,37] was used to group
proteins into putative gene families within our PlantTribes database. Of the 20,992 tribes identified by MCL
cluster analysis of the Arabidopsis and rice proteomes, 60
PlantTribes included at least one of 100 known floral
development regulators (Tables 2 and 3).
Unigene overlap
To estimate the complexity of the non-normalized nor tissue subtracted FGP cDNA libraries and the underlying floral transcriptomes, we analyzed predicted functions of the
FGP unigenes. Overall, functional classification of FGP
unigene assemblies shows that EST sequencing has captured a nearly uniform representation of the sampled
transcriptomes. On average, 53% of unigenes from each
taxon match Arabidopsis genes with an e-value of 1.0e-10 or
better. An analysis of GO annotations [38] for these genes
shows that the FGP unigene sets provide a remarkably
consistent sampling of functional classes defined for the
Arabidopsis proteome (Fig. 2). Moreover, similar GO classification frequencies were observed in a subset of 11,974
genes that were found to be expressed at moderate-to-high

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/5/5

levels (>100 units) in an Affymetrics microarray analysis
of young (stage 3) Arabidopsis inflorescences (Zhang et al.
unpublished data).
Estimation of unigene overlap is inherently error-prone
because best BLAST hits are not necessarily orthologs.
Moreover, even when orthology is established through
formal phylogenetic analysis, similarity in function does
not necessarily follow orthology [e.g. [39]]. We used the
PlantTribes database to estimate the overlap among our
unigene sets at the gene family level. Unigenes were sorted
into the tribes if they have best BLASTX hits to any member of the tribe. Each taxon has unigenes sorted to 19–
51% of the 60 tribes that include floral development regulators (Tables 2 and 3). On average, 70% of the gene
families represented in one EST set are represented in at
least one other EST set. As expected, the most overlap
occurs in the largest gene families (Fig. 3).
Among the 100 Arabidopsis floral regulatory genes identified from the literature (Tables 2 and 3), 67 have closely
related homologs (best BLAST hit) in at least one FGP EST
set. On average, ESTs with a best hit among the 100 listed
Arabidopsis flower development genes constitute approximately 1% of each FGP EST set. The average overlap of
best hits to these floral regulatory genes was 30.8%
between pairs of EST sets. The Amborella, Nuphar and
Eschscholzia unigene sets shared three-way overlap in best
BLAST hits to six floral development genes (AGAMOUS,
AGL6, APETALA3, SEPALLATA1, AXR6, and YABBY3;
Table 2) and these species plus Persea shared four-way
overlap in best BLAST hits two of these genes (APETALA3
and AXR6). In addition, the FGP ESTs/unigenes were
found to match on average 4.5% of the apparent singlegene/taxon tribes (representing putative single-copy
genes) from Arabidopsis. The average overlap of these putative single copy genes between two FGP taxa was 28%,
and three-way overlap of such genes among the Amborella,
Nuphar and Eschscholzia EST sets was 10% (representing
26 genes).
The high frequency (66%) of crucial Arabidopsis floral regulators identified in BLAST searches as best hits for
sequences in one or more of our EST sets (Tables 2 and 3)
indicates that FGP EST sets are a valuable resource for
comparative floral developmental studies. For example,
identifying homologs of genes being investigated in
model systems opens the door to broad cross-species
comparative analyses of gene function. Of the 1453 Arabidopsis genes that have recently been identified as having
organ-specific expression within developing flowers [40],
388 (27%) are best BLAST matches to genes from at least
one of our unigene sets (e.g. genes in Table 4). We consider this to be a high percentage, given that our cDNA

libraries were constructed from a subset of the developmental stages analyzed in the Arabidopsis study [40].
Given what is already known about gene duplications in
angiosperm history [e.g. [41-43]], the BLAST based measures of overlap are almost certainly underestimates of
cross-taxon sampling of orthologous gene sets (including
co-orthologs [44]) represented in our EST sets. Whereas
the measures of among-taxa overlap in gene families as
defined in the PlantTribe database provide a possible
upper bound on the degree of overlap among orthologous
sets, simple comparison of best BLAST hits in the Arabidopsis proteome provides a likely lower bound.
Formal phylogenetic analyses provide a more accurate
assessment of orthologous gene sets. For example, within

the MIKC MADS-box gene family, phylogenies uncover
greater levels of overlap among our EST sets than were
inferred from simple BLAST-based analyses. Of the 12
taxa listed in Table 1, representatives of the DEFICIENS,
GLOBOSA, AGAMOUS, FRUITFULL/SQUAMOSA, SEPALLATA, AGL6, and TM8 clades have been identified in 8, 6,
5, 3, 7, 9 and 2 unigene sets, respectively.
In addition to providing more accurate estimation of
overlap among the transcriptomes being sampled in EST
studies, phylogenetic analyses of gene families provide
insights into the evolutionary history of genes characterized in model systems. For example, recent phylogenetic
surveys of MADS box genes have identified gene
duplication events that appear to be associated with the

origin and rise of angiosperms and the radiation of core
eudicots [e.g., [45-50]].
Phylogenetic analyses of poorly understood gene families
can also provide valuable insights into both function and
phylogenetic history. For example, two of the 18 genes
identified as differentially expressed in petals by Wellmer
et al. [40] belong to a single gene family identified in
PlantTribes [33]. This gene family includes 10 Arabidopsis
genes and 16 rice genes, all containing a plant-specific
domain, DUF642 [35], the function of which is unknown.
DUF642 homologs were identified in ESTs sampled from
Amborella, Nuphar, Persea, Liriodendron as well as 16 additional plant species included in the TIGR plant gene indices [31]. A phylogeny of these sequences reveals one
weakly supported and two well supported subfamilies
(Fig. 4). We will refer to these putative subfamilies as
clades A, B, and C, respectively (Fig. 4). The well supported placement of a gymnosperm gene (from pine) as
sister to all angiosperm genes in clade C indicates that the
origin of this subfamily predated the common ancestor of
angiosperms and gymnosperms. Asterid, rosid and monocot genes can be identified in each of the three subfamilies; magnoliid genes are placed in clades A and B;
and the basal-most angiosperms (Amborella and the Nymphaeales) are represented in both clades B and C. The phylogeny suggests that one of the two genes identified by
Wellmer et al. [40] is a recent duplicate, the sister gene of
which is not differentially expressed in petals. Determining the expression patterns of other DUF642 genes in Arabidopsis, rice, and other plant species and mapping this
information onto the phylogeny would be a first step
toward understanding their current function and functional evolution.

Discussion
Proof-of-concept: EST coverage
Relative to the Gene Ontology (GO) functional classification, the FGP is detecting new, translated sequences with
astonishing similarity to frequencies known for the entire
Arabidopsis transcriptome. These gene discovery frequencies support the preliminary hypothesis that the functional complexity of the floral transcriptome roughly
equals that of the global plant transcriptome. This point is
supported by a comparison of the predicted Arabidopsis
proteome and the collection of genes identified as moderate-to-highly expressed in young Arabidopsis inflorescences (Fig. 2, Zhang et al. unpublished data). Moreover,
these detection rates ensure that FGP sequences will be of
great interest to the evolutionary biologists for analyses of
gene and genome duplications and selection at the molecular level, as well as to the plant molecular biological
community in general. For phylogenetics, FGP unigenes
assigned to single-gene PlantTribes (such as FRIGIDA and
GIGANTEA) could be used to develop nuclear markers

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/5/5

spanning all angiosperms. Indeed, further comparative
functional analyses of such single-copy genes could be
used to test whether natural selection culls duplicates
from plant genomes following segmental or genome-wide
duplication events.
Proof-of-concept: MADS-box genes
The efficacy of a comparative genomics approach to the
discovery of genes involved in floral development is illustrated in an analysis of MIKC-type MADS-box genes. To
date, 48 MADS unigenes were identified as likely
orthologs to major MADS-box groups, including those of
the MIKC-type MADS-box genes that encode well-characterized floral regulators, such as DEFICIENS, GLOBOSA,
and AGAMOUS. Further phylogenetic and expression
analyses of these newly identified genes from the FGP species promise to yield new insights into the evolution of
this gene family critical for flower development. In
addition, sequences representing the TM8 clade have been
identified in our Amborella and Persea EST sets. The TM8
gene, expressed in developing tomato flower buds, was
sequenced at an early point in the study of MADS-box
gene function [51]. Although a TM8 ortholog, ERAF17,
has been associated with female flower development in
cucumber [52], no ortholog of TM8 has been identified
within the Arabidopsis or rice genomes, suggesting that it
was lost from the genomes of these species. Identification
of TM8 orthologs in eudicots suggested that the gene
duplication establishing the lineage had at least occurred
among ancestral core eudicots [45]. However, phylogenetic placement of Amborella and Persea genes within this
clade pushes its origin back to the oldest node in
angiosperm phylogeny at least 130 Mya on the basis of
fossil evidence [53,54] and perhaps 145–208 Mya according to molecular estimates [20,55], suggesting that the
TM8-like genes were part of the basic floral "tool-kit" in
the earliest angiosperms. Had these new orthologs not
been identified, the limited understanding of the functions of TM8 and ERAF17 would have rendered them
unlikely targets for candidate gene analyses of basal
angiosperms.

The high capture rate of known floral development regulators in the MADS-box gene family can be considered a
proof-of-concept for the FGP. We expect this frequency to
increase for MADS-box and other floral gene families as
the size of FGP EST libraries and unigene sets expands.
Limitations
The FGP EST sets described here include sequences from
non-normalized nor tissue-subtracted cDNA libraries. As
such, many of the genes captured are expressed across
many tissues, which could in large part account for the
evenly proportioned GO classifications among FGP taxa
and the Arabidopsis proteome (Fig. 2). Additionally, our

A phylogeny for the DUF642-domain gene family indicates that two Arabidopsis genes with differential expression in petals [40]
are not the products of a recent duplication event. Genes with the plant-specific but functionally uncharacterized domain family
DUF642 form three clades (A, B, and C). In addition to the Arabidopsis genes with petal-specific expression patterns, Clade A
includes asterid, Vitis, monocot and magnoliid genes, indicating that the clade predates the divergence of these lineages (Fig. 1).
The genomes of basal-most angiosperm lineages (Amborella and Nymphaeales) and gymnosperms may also contain unsampled
Clade A genes. Clade B genes were sampled from Nuphar (Nymphaeales) and Clade C genes were identified from Amborella

approach to EST collection has limited the discovery of
transcripts known to be rare, such as for the SUPERMAN
gene [56]. Nonetheless, this limitation can be overcome
by either targeted screening of our cDNA libraries or
rtPCR.

hypotheses of function among all of the gene families captured. These resources will also be useful for designing
both taxon-specific and universal primer sets for
amplification and sequencing of specific genes sampled in
one or more of our EST sets.

Indeed, primer design for PCR amplification has already
been aided by use of alignable sequences observed across
multiple FGP EST sets. For example, primer pairs designed
from alignments of Amborella and Liriodendron unigenes
with Arabidopsis GIGANTEA and rice homologs have been
used successfully to amplify unsampled sequences in
Nuphar, Acorus, Eschscholzia and Ribes.

Methods

Although EST sequencing alone will result in incomplete
sampling of genes and gene families across taxa, they offer
many possibilities for further experimentation and
hypothesis testing. For example, EST resources provide the
opportunity to derive finished coding sequences that will
be more useful for genetic manipulation as well as for
comparative bioinformatics. Finished full-length cDNAs
can be used as tools for many research endeavors, ranging
from promoter isolation to anchoring of shotgun
genomic sequences. Whereas incomplete sequences for
sampled genes may reduce resolution and accuracy in
some phylogenetic analyses, parsimony methods are relatively robust with respect to missing data when taxon sampling is extensive [57].

Conclusion
ESTs and assembled unigenes collected from placeholders
for several critical lineages of basal angiosperms are helping to bridge the genomic gap between the eudicot and
monocot model plant systems. Initial findings suggest
that the basic floral transcriptome, as collected from nonnormalized, non-subtractive cDNA libraries, are similar to
the inferred Arabidopsis transcriptome in the proportions
of its GO functional categories. Moreover, the rates of
acquisition of known floral gene homologues among the
various basal angiosperm EST sets are high. Finally, in one
example of floral gene capture, representation among the
ESTs of one lineage of the MADS-box gene family has set
the origin of that gene group before the divergence of
monocots from basal angiosperms. Together, these results
provide strong proofs-of-concept for the Floral Genome
Project. We anticipate that these initial findings will afford
the opportunity to address a number of conspicuous evolutionary genomic questions, including reproductive
organ transcriptome overlap between angiosperms and
gymnosperms, genome-wide duplication history, identification of lineage-specific gene duplications and functional divergence, and analyses of adaptive molecular
evolution. More generally, plant scientists may use the
FGP resources and the comparative method to enhance
estimates of sequence/domain conservation as well as

Sampling rationale and molecular methods
We selected species for analysis (Fig. 1, Table 1) by balancing the following major criteria: (1) phylogenetic position, (2) diversity of floral-organ structure (but absence of
highly specialized floral features), (3) direct relevance to
crop or economic plants, (4) diploid with a small genome
size, (5) availability of inbred lines, when possible, (6)
possession of other desirable properties, such as large
numbers of flowers per plant, transformability, and having been the focus of prior flower developmental study,
(7) non-duplication of ongoing studies of the floral
transcriptome – i.e., non-duplication of effort with ongoing studies of model plants (Arabidopsis, tomato, maize,
rice, alfalfa, soybean, cotton, etc.). Welwitschia and Zamia
are gymnosperms representing the gymnosperm phyla
Gnetophyta and Cycadophyta, respectively. Sequence
data from these species and a growing number of conifer
species are providing insights into the gene family content
in the most recent common ancestor of angiosperms and
gymnosperms. Amborella, Nuphar (water lily), and Illicium
(star anise) represent the most basal clades of extant
angiosperms. Saruma, Liriodendron (tulip poplar), and Persea (avocado) represent three different orders of magnoliids. Persea is a valuable fruit crop and Liriodendron is a
transformable timber species. Acorus (sweetflag) is sister
to all other monocot phylogeny and Eschscholzia (California poppy) is a transformable species representing the
basal eudicots. Asparagus, Cucumis (cucumber), Ribes (currant, gooseberry), and Vaccinium (blueberry) are all crop
species holding strategic positions in Angiosperm phylogeny. Finally, Mesembryanthemum (ice plant) is a model for
the study of Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) in
drought-resistant plants [58] and represents the Caryophyllales clade of core eudicots.

Isolating high quality RNA and building cDNA libraries
was particularly challenging for many of the FGP taxa,
most of which are non-cultivated. The cDNA libraries
from these species were constructed using pre-meiotic
immature floral tissues (or reproductive structures in the
case of gymnosperms), in order to enrich for early floral
regulatory genes important for floral patterning and to
prevent heavy representation of the many anther-specific
genes that are highly expressed in pollen development.
Each library, non-subtractive and non-normalized to be
most representative of the floral transcriptome, was made
with a signature adaptor-linker sequence to eliminate the
possibility of misidentification of clones in the future.

Overrepresentation of genes among the libraries was further reduced by sampling mRNA from very young floral
buds which have a high diversity of cell types and lack the
cells, such as tapetum and pollen, that contain a large
number of specific transcripts. Detailed methods used for
mRNA extraction, cDNA library construction, and information on library attributes (vector, cloning sites, titer,
average insert size, etc.) can be found in Table 1 and on
the FGP homepage [29].
Sequence processing pipeline
A standard sequence analysis pipeline was developed consisting of base calling using PHRED [59], vector and E. coli
sequence contamination screening, and unigene assembly. In addition, a database was developed that also serves
as the back end for the Plant Genome Network website
[28]. The analysis pipeline and the sequence database are
tightly integrated. The quality screen consisted of trimming low-quality sequence, based on PHRED scores,
using a custom algorithm. To extend the high-quality
sequence as far as possible given a particular quality
threshold, the sequence was scanned and, concomitantly,
the difference between the quality score and the quality
threshold (termed the "adjusted score") was integrated
over the length of the sequence. The high-quality
sequence was defined as the region of sequence in which
the integration of the adjusted score was maximal; this
region can include small regions of lower-scoring nucleotides if they are "compensated" by higher-scoring downstream sequence. Next, putative polyA tails were removed
if they contained more than 20 consecutive adenine residues. A contamination screen was performed to remove E.
coli chromosomal sequences from the dataset. In a final
quality screening step, sequences with lengths below a certain threshold (150 bp), sequences with more than 4%
ambiguous base calls (Ns), and sequences with a complexity below a given threshold (defined as sequence
composed of more than 60% of a given nucleotide) were
rejected. The rejected sequences were not used in unigene
builds, but were retained in the database along with information as to why they were rejected.
Unigene building
Unigene sets were built for each species by combining the
sequences from all available libraries for that species. The
sequences were first pre-clustered, and these clusters were
then assembled using the cap3 [60] program. The cap3
identify parameter was set at 95%. Unigene sequences
were also checked for length, complexity and contamination, and chimera detection was performed. The builds
were uploaded to the PGN database, where each unigene
was assigned a unique unigene ID. Subsequent unigene
builds of the same libraries attributed new IDs to all unigenes. Unigenes from a newer build were then tracked to
the older builds through the ESTs that they share, and as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/5/5

such, a complete history of unigene IDs is available on the
website for tracking unigenes through the different builds.
Annotation of sequence data
Several strategies were used to get the best possible annotation for the unigene sequences. First, BLAST was used to
find the best match for each unigene sequence in the GenBank NR database, and in the complete coding sequences
from Arabidopsis [34]. These annotations were stored in
the database and serve as the primary source of FGP
sequence annotation. To get a better overview for the
annotations, we used the Gene Ontology (GO) system
[38,61] to compare the sequence annotations from different species. Gene Ontology is a hierarchical system representing biological knowledge. Many model systems, such
as Arabidopsis, are being annotated using GO [38,61]. The
Arabidopsis GO annotations were transferred to each unigene that had a match with an Arabidopsis sequence with
an e value less than 10-20. For the comparison of annotations among species, we focused on the biological functional GO category. We selected a number of high-level
GO function terms as a GO slim vocabulary, and then
mapped the GO annotations to the GO slim terms using
the map2slim.pl script provided by the Gene Ontology
consortium [38].
Phylogenetic analyses of putative gene families
Floral Genome Project unigene assemblies and finished
cDNAs were regularly subjected to phylogenetically-based
classification. The general procedure was as follows: (1)
for each PlantTribe of interest, use all Arabidopsis, rice and
FGP sequences to search public databases [30,31,62,63]
for similar protein coding genes (e < 10-20), (2) machine
align all sequences using ClustalW [64], T-Coffee [65] or
Muscle [66], (3) manually assess alignment, removing all
highly divergent sequences, and then repeat step 2, (4)
subject alignment to fast parsimony analysis both with
and without branch support estimation [67-69]. The parsimony phylogeny shown for the DUF642 gene family
(Fig. 4) is the strict consensus of 67 equally parsimonious
trees estimated for an amino-acid alignment. The parsimony analysis was executed in PAUP* [66] with 100 random addition replicates and tree bisection-reconnection
(TBR) branch swapping. Bootstrap analysis was performed with 250 replicates. The alignment is available in
NEXUS format through the FGP website [29]. Two regions
of the alignment were deemed questionable and removed
from the phylogenetic analysis.
