Abstract
Background: Identifying coevolving positions in protein sequences has myriad applications,
ranging from understanding and predicting the structure of single molecules to generating
proteome-wide predictions of interactions. Algorithms for detecting coevolving positions can be
classified into two categories: tree-aware, which incorporate knowledge of phylogeny, and treeignorant, which do not. Tree-ignorant methods are frequently orders of magnitude faster, but are
widely held to be insufficiently accurate because of a confounding of shared ancestry with
coevolution. We conjectured that by using a null distribution that appropriately controls for the
shared-ancestry signal, tree-ignorant methods would exhibit equivalent statistical power to treeaware methods. Using a novel t-test transformation of coevolution metrics, we systematically
compared four tree-aware and five tree-ignorant coevolution algorithms, applying them to
myoglobin and myosin. We further considered the influence of sequence recoding using reducedstate amino acid alphabets, a common tactic employed in coevolutionary analyses to improve both
statistical and computational performance.
Results: Consistent with our conjecture, the transformed tree-ignorant metrics (particularly
Mutual Information) often outperformed the tree-aware metrics. Our examination of the effect of
recoding suggested that charge-based alphabets were generally superior for identifying the
stabilizing interactions in alpha helices. Performance was not always improved by recoding
however, indicating that the choice of alphabet is critical.
Conclusion: The results suggest that t-test transformation of tree-ignorant metrics can be
sufficient to control for patterns arising from shared ancestry.

Background
Knowledge of positions that coevolve in biological
sequences can be applied to predict structures of RNAs [1-

3] and proteins [4-7]; to predict intermolecular interactions [6,8]; to identify functionally important regions of
molecules [9,10]; and to identify energetic pathways

through molecules [11,12]. Coevolutionary analyses have
frequently been performed on one or a few protein families. However, just as The Adaptive Evolution Database
[13] allows proteome-wide studies of evolutionary rates,
proteome-wide studies of coevolution could also be could
performed if sufficiently fast and well-characterized methods for detecting coevolution were available.
As biological sequences are the product of an evolutionary
process, it intuitively makes sense that the accuracy of
analyses of the historical processes affecting them will be
improved by explicit representation of those historical
processes. Incorporation of phylogenetic information has
benefited diverse classes of bioinformatics algorithms,
including multiple sequence alignment [14], comparison
of microbial communities [15], and functional annotation of genes [16]. Accordingly, incorporation of phylogenetic knowledge to control for patterns in biological
sequence data that arise from ancestry is regarded as
essential for coevolutionary analyses and best achieved by
directly incorporating the phylogeny in the metric
[7,17,18].
Many coevolution algorithms ('tree-aware' methods) have
explicitly attempted to control for phylogeny (e.g., [46,9,17,19,20]), while others ('tree-ignorant' methods)
have implicitly assumed a star phylogeny (e.g.,
[10,12,21,22]). Drawbacks have been identified for both
approaches. Likelihood based tree-aware methods have
the disadvantage of being sensitive to model mis-specification, a property common to all likelihood methods,
and generally have a much longer compute time than treeignorant methods. Tree-ignorant methods are thought to
have decreased specificity due to confounding of correlations arising from selective pressure with correlations arising from shared ancestry represented by the phylogeny
[9,23,24]. Past evaluations of the effect of tree topology
on the performance of coevolution algorithms have used
simulated data, and have confirmed that non-star tree
topologies can cause false positives [21,23,25,26].
Clearly, controlling for shared ancestry is essential but
approaches that do so without explicitly representing the
phylogenetic tree are possible. We hypothesized a treeignorant statistic can be informative if it is compared to a
distribution of the same statistic with the same embedded
ancestry but variable in coevolution. In this case, the
shared ancestry origin of correlated evolution dominates
the background distribution. A greater magnitude of correlated evolution than this background is thus evidence of
coevolution.
An additional consideration for estimating coevolution is
that encoding protein alignments with reduced-state
amino acid alphabets reduces computational complexity,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/327

and may also increase statistical power [5,7,21,27]. In a
reduced-state alphabet, the twenty amino acids are collapsed to a smaller number of states. For example, a threestate 'charge' alphabet can be achieved by treating His,
Lys, and Arg as the 'positively charged' state; Asp and Glu
as the 'negatively charged' state; and, all other residues as
the 'uncharged' state. The recoding chosen for a group of
sequences constitutes an explicit hypothesis concerning
the primary biochemical property subjected to coevolutionary pressures by natural selection. The motivation for
choosing to recode sequences stems from the bias-variance trade-off, where statistical models with fewer parameters have lower variance (and typically greater statistical
power) but more bias. A coevolution algorithm applied to
sequences with fewer states should therefore have more
power to identify pairs of positions which coevolve as a
result of the physicochemical property being modeled
(e.g., charge) because variability within each state is hidden. Information is lost in recoding to a reduced-state
alphabet, so the power for detecting coevolution arising
from other properties of amino acid residues (e.g., sidechain volume) decreases. The sensitivity of inference concerning coevolution to the encoding choice is unclear.
Evaluations of coevolution algorithms on simulated data
elucidate the strengths and limitations of the algorithms,
but are forced to rely on simplifying assumptions about
the biological systems being modeled. Evaluations on
biological data are therefore important for understanding
how an algorithm will perform under more realistic circumstances. Biologically relevant evaluations are difficult
however, because we have little knowledge of when
sequence positions truly coevolve, and therefore do not
have a good idea of what the true positives are.
Different approaches have been employed to define coevolutionary positive-controls. Individual cases of coevolution are directly supported by observation of variants
known to cause disease in one species in another species
[28]. This class of variant has been reported for both RNA
and protein coding genes and does exhibit strong statistical evidence for coevolution [27]. The suitability of this
class of variation for examining the properties of coevolution, however, is low for both practical and biological reasons: the number of cases for which there is sufficient data
from related species is low; and, the identification of these
variants as pathological suggests the selection coefficients
operating on them is very strong and thus may not be representative of the strength of selection responsible for
most coevolution.
An alternative approach has been to focus on candidate
molecular-structure influences likely to be subjected to
natural selection. Past evaluations on (non-simulated)
RNA alignments have treated base pairs as positive con-

trols and all other pairs as negative controls [1,2,20,24].
These have been useful for comparing algorithms on RNA,
but it is not clear that performance on RNA alignments
translates well to performance on protein alignments
because interactions between residues in proteins are generally more complex. Protein gold standards have been
designed to evaluate a method's ability to identify residue
contacts in tertiary structure by defining residues pairs
within a certain C distance in a representative crystal
structure as positive controls, and all other pairs as negative controls [5,9,20-22,29-32]. The set of residue pairs
within a small C distance in tertiary structure in a representative crystal structure is recognized as a coarse criteria
because it is not clear that close physical proximity is an
essential precondition for coevolution [32], and because a
single crystal structure may not accurately describe the tertiary contacts in all sequences in the alignment.
To complement residue-contact-based comparisons, we
present a novel secondary-structure-based method for
comparing coevolution methods where the known periodic stabilizing interactions between stacked residues in
protein alpha helices are taken as positive controls. Double-mutant studies of protein alpha helices have shown
that stacked residues in alpha helices interact to stabilize
the helix [33-36]. Statistical analyses support these results
by showing that the interactions are present in diverse
families of alpha helices [5,9,37-39]. Stabilization is
thought to result from ionic interaction, aromatic-aromatic interaction, or hydrogen bonding between stacked
side chains. Although there has been discussion on the
validity of these studies [40], biophysical and statistical
analyses continue to support the case for stabilizing interactions. These interactions occur between the stacked
positions in the alpha helix, or the positions separated by
three residues in primary structure (i, i + 4) (where i refers
to the sequence position), and to a lesser extent between
positions separated by two residues (i, i + 3), corresponding to the 3.6 residue per turn periodicity of the alpha
helix. Since interactions between stacked residues appear
important for alpha helix stability, we argue that positions
should coevolve to conserve these interactions. Methods
for detecting coevolution in proteins should therefore
identify stacked residues in alpha helices, as illustrated in
[5,26,38,41] providing a positive control for coevolution
detection algorithms. We emphasize that we are not presenting the coevolution algorithms that we test as methods for detecting alpha helices from sequence data, but
rather exploiting the known regular structure of the helix
as a gold standard for detecting coevolution: methods for
detecting coevolution should, at minimum, be able to
recapture these regularities.
We report an assessment of the hypothesis that appropriately transformed tree-ignorant metrics have similar statis-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/327

tical power to tree-aware approaches by performing a
systematic comparison of nine coevolution algorithms.
Five of the algorithms – Mutual Information (MI), Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) [21], Resampled
Mutual Information (RMI) (introduced here), Statistical
Coupling Analysis (SCA) [12], and Corrected Mutual
Information (MIp) [22] – use multiple sequence alignments but no phylogenetic trees. The other four methods
– LnLCorr [5,7], Ancestral States (AS) [4,17], the Generalized Continuous-Time Markov Process Coevolutionary
Algorithm (GCTMPCA) [3,6], and CoMap [20,24] – use
multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees. We
additionally considered including the method described
in [9], but opted to include NMI and MIp instead since
they are expected to perform better than the former (K.
Wollenberg, personal communication). The algorithms
were compared by application to real (i.e., non-simulated) protein sequence alignments.
In a secondary study, our alignments are recoded in 52
different reduced-state amino acid alphabets to evaluate
the utility of amino acid alphabets which model different
chemical properties, and to test the hypothesis that alphabets with fewer states are generally better for detecting
coevolution.

Results
Five tree-ignorant methods and four tree-aware methods
for detecting coevolving positions were compared on four
multiple sequence alignments using the full amino acid
alphabet and, when applicable, 52 reduced amino acid
alphabets. Two of the alignments, tetrapod myoglobin
(42 sequences, 153 positions) and chordate myosin rod
(114 sequences, 1064 positions), represent mostly alpha
helical protein sequences and thus our positive controls.
The other two alignments are matched negative controls
generated by shuffling the order of positions in each
observed alignment to remove all structural information.
The statistical significance of coevolution metrics between
alignment columns separated by a specified distance was
determined using the t-test transformation (Figure 1).
Applying a coevolution algorithm to an alignment results
in a 'coevolution matrix,' where each position in the lower
triangle contains a pairwise coevolutionary score. Each
coevolution matrix, constructed based on a combination
of method, alignment, and alphabet, was evaluated to
determine to what degree the combination allowed detection of the periodicity of the alpha helix. The distribution
of scores from (i, i + n) positions in a coevolution matrix
were compared with the distribution of all other scores in
the same matrix using a two-sample t-test. Significant pvalues at n = 3 or n = 4 were taken as evidence of a
method's ability to detect coevolution, as these are the
stacked positions in alpha helices which are expected to

Diagram1of alpha-helix-based evaluation
Diagram of alpha-helix-based evaluation. (A) Stacked positions in alpha helices have been observed to coevolve to maintain ionic interactions which stabilize the helix. The periodicity of the alpha helix is 3.6 residues per turn, so stacked positions
are the (i, i + 3) and (i, i + 4) position pairs, where i is the position number. K133/E136 form an (i, i + 3) pair capable of an ionic
interaction; D141/K145 are an (i, i + 4) pair capable of an ionic interaction. The structure is a single helix extracted from 1
MBD, a sperm whale myoglobin structure, diagramed with PyMol. (B) The distribution of coevolution scores from (i, i + n)
position pairs are compared against a background distribution generated from all other position pairs in the same alignment
using a one-tailed, two-sample t-test. The scale of the y-axes differ due to the large difference in the number of position pairs
in each distribution. The p-values resulting from these tests are those presented in this document. These t-test p-values were
compared against p-values generated with other statistical tests to confirm the applicability of the t-test to these data (see
Methods).

coevolve to retain alpha helix stability. Although the coevolutionary scores are not directly comparable between the
methods, the t-test transformation standardizes the metrics, allowing evaluation of the relative performance of
each method. We note here that although the distance
matrix structure of the result matrices violates the independence clause of the t-test, we validated the robustness
of results using a non-parametric matrix permutation test
(described in Methods).
Tree-aware versus tree-ignorant methods
The tree-ignorant methods are more capable of detecting
coevolutionary signal at (i, i + 3) and (i, i + 4) in
myoglobin than the tree-aware methods (Table 1A, row 1,
p = 1.50 × 10-3 and row 3, p = 4.97 × 10-13, respectively).
There is no statistically significant difference in performance between the tree-aware methods on myoglobin or
the myoglobin negative control (Table 2). Between the
tree-ignorant methods, there is a statistically significant
performance difference at (i, i + 3) in favor of MIp, NMI,
and SCA (Table 3A, row 1); and at (i, i + 4) in favor of NMI
and SCA (Table 3A, row 2). MI incurred more Type 1 error
than the other methods (Table 3B, row 1, p = 2.71 × 10-3).

In myosin, there is no significant difference in the performance of the tree-aware and tree-ignorant methods at
(i, i + 3) or (i, i + 4) after SCA cutoff optimization, but
before SCA optimization the tree-aware algorithms
achieve better performance at (i, i + 4) (Table 1C). The
absence of a significant difference could reflect either real
properties of the methods, or arise from reduced statistical
power of this particular comparison. There is more variability in the branch lengths in the myosin data set (Figure
2), suggesting the possibility that as the relationships
between sequences becomes more variable, accounting
for those relationships becomes more important. However, the statistical power of the method comparisons are
not identical between the myoglobin and myosin cases.
Due to the computational intensity of GCTMPCA and
LnLCorr07, these methods were not practical to run on
the myosin alignment and tree. (Single runs of GCTMPCA
and LnLCorr07 on the myosin rod were stopped after running for greater than 78 processor hours and 383 processor hours, respectively.) As a result, the myosin case has a
reduced number of observations compared with that for
myoglobin which will reduce the statistical power to identify differences between the method classes. Comparing
LnLCorr99, CoMap, and AS on myosin shows that there is
no statistically significant difference in these methods at
(i, i + 3) (Table 2C, row 1) but that AS and CoMap outperform LnLCorr99 at (i, i + 4) (Table 2C, row 2, p = 8.33 ×
10-4). Of the tree-ignorant methods, there was a statistically significant difference in the performance of the individual methods (Table 3C), and MI achieved the highest
ratio of significant to insignificant scores, and fared well

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/327

in terms of Type 1 error (Table 3D). On the myosin negative control, MIp achieved significantly more false positives than the other methods (Table 3D, row 1, p = 7.38 ×
10-11). The ability of MI to out-perform all of the other
methods, including the tree-aware methods, is extremely
surprising.
Figure 3 shows the relative performance of all methods
and parameter settings (alphabet choice, SCA cutoff and
GCTMPCA ). These data illustrate the results of the 2 tests
(Figure 3A,C), and the negative controls confirm the
validity of the evaluations by consistently showing no
coevolution where it is not expected (Figure 3B,D).
The tree-aware and tree-ignorant methods were additionally evaluated on their ability to identify individual coevolving pairs by comparing area under the curve (AUC)
scores for precision and recall (see Methods for definitions) for each method, alphabet combination (Figure 4).
On the myoglobin data set, the tree-ignorant methods
achieved higher AUC scores for precision and recall than
the tree-aware methods. On the myosin alignment, the
tree-ignorant methods achieved higher AUC scores for
recall than the tree-aware methods, but the highest precision scores appear similar between the two classes of
methods. On the myoglobin negative control, the treeignorant methods achieved higher AUC scores for precision and recall, suggesting more false positives for the
tree-ignorant methods. On the myosin negative control,
precision appears similar between the two classes, while
the tree-ignorant methods appear to have achieved higher
recall, indicating more false positives. Because the negative controls are a shuffled version of the original alignments, the total hits count is the same for the positive and
negative control coevolution matrices for a given method,
alphabet combination (with the exception of the LnLCorr
methods, where the coevolution scores differ slightly
between positive and negative control alignments). Due
to the difficulty of defining positives and negatives (discussed in Methods), the precision, recall, and F-measure
values for the negative controls are less meaningful than
for the positive control, but are provided for completeness. Precision and recall results are summarized via Fmeasure in Figure 5, which presents the F-measure AUCs
achieved by each method with each alphabet. The median
F-measure AUCs appear higher for the tree-ignorant methods in both positive and negative controls. Precision,
recall, F-measure, total hits, and AUC data for all method,
alphabet combinations are provided [see Additional file
1].
Alphabet reduction
To evaluate the effect of the size and type of reduced-state
alphabets on algorithm performance, each alignment was
recoded with 52 reduced-state alphabets. Coevolution

3) and (i, i + 4), using all reduced-state amino acid alphabets, where applicable. Some of the methods (LnLCorr07 and GCTMPCA) were not run on
myosin (see text), causing different numbers of runs on the myosin versus the myoglobin data sets. Additionally, the reduced-state alphabets were
not applicable to all tree-aware methods, causing the sum of the p-value counts to differ for the tree-aware versus tree-ignorant methods. Bolded
rows highlight statistically significant 2 results, indicating a difference between the tree-aware and tree-ignorant populations. Bold counts in these
rows highlight which class of methods achieved the higher ratio of significant to insignificant scores. Counts are calculated including both the
empirically determined best and worst SCA cutoffs to illustrate the effect of this free parameter on method performance, and with the empirically
validated optimal = 0.70 value for GCTMPCA. The data suggest that tree-ignorant methods perform better on the myoglobin alignment (A), and
there is no statistically significant difference in the classes on the myosin rod domain alignment except when using the empirically determined worst
SCA cutoff choice, when the tree-aware methods perform better (C). The myoglobin (B) and myosin (D) negative controls suggest that there is no

between the tree-aware methods with the single exception being (i, i+ 4) in myosin, where AS and CoMap out-perform LnLCorr99. Data is not
presented on the myosin alignment for tree-aware methods which proved too computationally intensive to be practical. Counts in Table 2 can be
directly compared with counts in Table 3. = 0.01.

algorithms were applied to each recoded alignment in
addition to the original (full-alphabet) alignments. The
45 'Atchley-factor' alphabets are based on five metrics
(A1–A5) presented in [42], and are used primarily to evaluate the effect of alphabet size. The 7 'rationally-designed'
alphabets were developed based more canonical amino
acid metrics, and are used primarily to evaluate the effect
of alphabet type. Alphabet names describe the alphabet
type (i.e., the property being modeled) followed by alphabet size (i.e., the number of states). For example, A1_4
refers to the A1-based alphabet with four states, and
CHARGE_3 refers to the charge-based alphabet with three
states. Alphabet definitions are presented in Table 5.
The data illustrate markedly different results with different
alphabet definitions, both in terms of number of states
and amino acid property modeled.

The effect of alphabet size
In the myoglobin alignment (42 sequences by 153 positions), there is no clear relationship between performance
and number of alphabet states (Table 4A). The three of
thirty-five correlations that are significant after correction
for multiple comparisons are positive correlations, suggesting increased performance with more states. In the
negative control (Table 4B) however, the ratio of significant to insignificant correlations is similar. These data
therefore do not strongly support a relationship between
alphabet size and method performance.

In the myosin rod alignment (114 sequences by 1064
positions) a positive correlation frequently exists between
alphabet size and ability to detect alpha helix periodicity
(Table 4C), particularly for MI, NMI, and MIp. This suggests that more alphabet states improve performance for
these methods on the myosin rod. Seven of the thirty cor-

rows highlight statistically significant 2 results, indicating a difference between the methods. Bold counts in these rows highlight which method

multiple comparisons, compared with one of thirty in the
negative control (Table 4D).
The effect of alphabet type
The 'rationally-designed' alphabets generally out-perform
the Atchley-factor alphabets [see Additional file 2],
although the A1-based and A5-based alphabets were frequently among the top performing alphabets. The
CHARGE_* alphabets very commonly yield the most significant p-values at (i, i + 4) in both alignments. As A1 and
A5 are charge and polarity factors, these were expected to
perform well. In myoglobin, of the methods that identified (i, i + 4) pairs with statistical significance at = 0.01,
seventeen of the thirty-five top-performing alphabets were
the rationally designed alphabets. Eleven of the eighteen
top-performing Atchley-factor alphabets were A1- or A5based. In myosin, fifteen of the thirty top performing
alphabets were rationally designed, and five of the fourteen top-performing Atchley-factor alphabets were A1- or

A5-based. One of the top-performing alphabets for MIp
was the unreduced alphabet (ORIG). It is not clear why
the A3- and A4-based alphabets performed better in
myosin, although these mostly did well with RMI. RMI
exhibits very little variance in p-value based on choice of
alphabet (Figure 6), which may make p-value-based ranking less meaningful. Because LnLCorr99 and CoMap use
alphabets differently from the other algorithms (see Methods), the corresponding counts of Atchley-factor and
'rationally-designed' alphabets were not included in these
computations. Top-performing alphabets for these methods are however presented [see Additional file 2].
The four-state alphabet based on Atchley Factor 4 (A1_4)
shows up frequently in the top alphabets, and on inspection appears to mirror the decisions that might be made if
manually defining an alphabet based on this metric (Bin
1: CVILF, Bin 2: MWAGS, Bin 3: TPYHQ, Bin 4: NDERK).
These bins mimic natural break-points in this metric, with
the exception of Q being in Bin 3. The generally high per-

formance of coevolution methods working on alignments
encoded in A1_4 suggests that it may compliment the use
of the more canonical reduced-state alphabets, and that
other Atchley-factor alphabets defined based on natural
breaks in the data may also yield good results.
GCTMPCA and SCA parameters
SCA and GCTMPCA both require a single parameter (cutoff and , respectively) from the user. Experimentation
with the values of these parameters was incorporated into
the analyses, and was found to have a strong effect on
method performance. [3] and [6] suggest 0.70 as an optimal setting for . This was empirically validated here by
comparing performance for detecting signal at (i, i + 3)
and (i, i + 4) in myoglobin using the full amino acid

alphabet and two reduced-state alphabets (data not
shown).
The optimal value for the SCA cutoff parameter was
empirically found to be variable (see distributions of performance by cutoff in Figure 6A,C) and did not match the
values obtained as recommended in [12]. When applied
to the alignments without alphabet reduction, the recommended steps identify 0.947 as the optimal value for
myosin, and 1.0 as the optimal value for myoglobin
(meaning there are not enough sequences for the analysis). The empirically-determined optimal cutoff for detecting coevolutionary signal at (i, i + 4) in myosin was 0.6,
and in myoglobin was 0.8, when no alphabet reduction
was applied. These results suggest that the steps presented

Discussion
Tree-aware versus tree-ignorant techniques
Tree-ignorant coevolution algorithms matched or outperformed the tree-aware coevolution algorithms for

identifying coevolving positions in alpha helices. With the
exception of CoMap, the tree-aware methods also generally required vastly more compute time than the treeignorant methods, despite the slowest of these algorithms
(GCTMPCA and LnLCorr) being implemented in C while
the other algorithms are predominantly implemented in
Python (C implementations are frequently orders of magnitude faster than equivalent implementations in

Python). The C++ implementation of CoMap was the fastest of the methods. In some cases, standard Mutual Information out-performed all other algorithms (Table 3C).
These observations suggest that when transformed in a
manner that adjusts for shared ancestry, as demonstrated
here, tree-ignorant methods can be more reliable than
tree-aware methods. Although consideration of additional genes with substantial sampled lineages may support a convergence in robustness between the two method
classes, the computational performance advantage of treeignorant methods establishes them as the metric of choice
for comprehensive surveys of molecular coevolution.

Figure 6 illustrates that with the correct parameter choices
(i.e., amino acid alphabet and free parameters to algorithms) nearly all of the methods can identify the (i, i + 4)
stacked residues in the two alpha helical proteins. In most
applications however, the 'correct' amino acid alphabet
will not be known prior to the analysis, and it will not be
practical to optimize the free parameters and alphabet.
For example, if trying to infer protein-protein interactions
on a genome-wide scale based on coevolutionary relationships, true positives would not be known. Even if a subset
of known interactions could be used for optimization, the
compute time would be prohibitive. Methods that are fast
and robust to parameter choice are preferable. In

are F-measure area under the curve (AUC) scores for (A) tetrapod myoglobin, (B) randomized tetrapod myoglobin, (C) chordate myosin rod, and (D) randomized chordate myosin rod. The computation of AUC values is described in Methods. Red
lines indicate the median AUC, and the top and bottom of the boxes indicate the upper and lower quartile values, respectively.
Whiskers represent the largest and smallest AUC values within 1.5 × IQR (inter-quartile range), and pluses represent outliers,
or points outside of 1.5 × IQR. Methods with more condensed distributions are those that appear more robust to alphabet
choice. AS: Ancestral States; L07: LnLCorr07; L99: LnLCorr99; MI: Mutual Information; NMI: Normalized Mutual Information;

myoglobin, MI and NMI stand out in this respect: the distribution of scores achieved by these two metrics is
skewed toward statistical significance compared with the
other methods (Figure 6A). The same appears true in
myosin, with RMI additionally appearing extremely
robust to alphabet choice but achieving a lower median pvalue compared to MI and NMI (Figure 6C). AS, MIp, and
CoMap generally perform well on myosin, although some

alphabet choices with AS and MIp can lead to very poor
performance. The variance introduced by the cutoff
parameter choice with SCA is large in both alignments,
and GCTMPCA and LnLCorr do not appear robust to
alphabet choice and achieve median p-values below the
= 0.05 significance threshold, suggesting that these methods would be less useful in cases where the choice of

For each of the five heuristically defined alphabets, Kendall correlation coefficients ( ) and corresponding p-values are provided to illustrate the
relationship between performance rank and alphabet size. Bolded values highlight p-values = 0.05, and starred values indicated p-values significant
after adjustment for multiple comparisons (A-B Bonferroni-adjusted = 0.0014, C-D Bonferroni-adjusted = 0.0017). Tau range: [-1., 1.]. A positive
value indicates a positive correlation (i.e., increased alphabet size is associated with increased performance), and a negative value indicates a
negative correlation (i.e., decreased alphabet size is associated with increased performance).

alphabet cannot be optimized or confidently specified a
priori.
The ability of tree-ignorant methods, and MI in particular,
to out-perform tree-aware methods is a seemingly surprising result given previous demonstrations of high false
positives for this method class. We have argued, and our
results demonstrate, the t-test transformation provides
sufficient control for the shared ancestry cause of associations. Because every column (position) in an alignment
has the same underlying relationship among the rows
(sequences), every estimated pairwise coevolution score
will have this influence in common. Pairs with a true
coevolutionary history will have both that shared ancestry
and the additional influence of coevolution, and so
should stand out from the non-coevolving pairs.
Alphabet size
Larger alphabets frequently improve performance of coevolution algorithms (MI, NMI, and MIp in particular) on
the myosin data set, but there is no obvious relationship
between alphabet size and coevolution algorithm performance on the myoglobin data. The differences
observed on myoglobin and myosin may be explainable
by differences in the quantity of input data. The myosin
rod data set has more sequences than the myoglobin data
set, and therefore more states to observe when calculating
a pairwise coevolution score between two columns.
Grouping residues via reduced alphabets is expected to
improve statistical performance by providing a clearer picture of the distribution of residue types. The additional
observations (sequences) present in the myosin alignment appear sufficient to describe the residue distribution
without recoding, and the information loss associated
with recoding in fewer states may therefore result in
decreased statistical performance. The lack of a significant
positive or negative correlation between alphabet size and
statistical performance on myoglobin suggests that
(unlike on myosin) higher-state alphabets are not better,

and that a generic benefit associated with fewer-state
alphabets may only arise on alignments with less
sequences than the myoglobin data.
An alternative explanation for the positive correlation
between alphabet size and performance in myosin is that
the Atchley-factor alphabets are not useful categorizations
of the data. If true, as the number of states increases (and
the alphabets become more similar to the full amino acid
alphabet) they should perform better. The strongest correlations however are achieved with the A1 and A5 alphabets, which are the Atchley-factor alphabets that are
expected to perform the best (because they model charge
and polarity, the features known to be important to interactions in alpha helices). Some of the best performances
overall were achieved using these alphabets [see Additional file 2], so this explanation appears unlikely.
Much previous work, including [5] which used the same
myoglobin alignment and tree, has focused on the
assumption that smaller alphabets are generally better. If
true, a negative correlation should exist between alphabet
size and method performance. This is not observed, suggesting that in practice smaller alphabets do not necessarily improve statistical performance.
Alphabet type
If probing for coevolution resulting from a specific type of
physicochemical interaction, a reduced alphabet which
models that physicochemical property in fewer states
should increase power. There is serious risk, however, of
losing power by using the incorrect reduced alphabet. For
example, the p-value for identifying signal at (i, i + 4) with
MI increased (i.e., became less significant) from 1.5 × 1027 with the CHARGE_3 alphabet, to 1.0 × 10-3 with the
SIZE_2 alphabet. For all methods analyzed on myosin
with reduced alphabets – AS, MI, NMI, RMI, MIp, and
SCA – the SIZE_2 alphabet always resulted in less significant p-values than the CHARGE_3 alphabet. This illus-

trates that recoding with the correct alphabet (CHARGE_3
here) will highlight a coevolutionary relationship based
on that property, but that recoding with an incorrect
alphabet (SIZE_2 here) will obscure the coevolutionary
signal. Non-sensical alphabet recoding should destroy the
coevolutionary signal. If the interaction type (e.g., charge,
size) is not known ahead of time, using the unreduced
alphabet can provide useful results and should be safer
than making an uninformed choice of reduced alphabet.

The importance of choosing the 'correct' reduced alphabet
is illustrated by variable performance of a single algorithm
even when the alphabet choices have the same number of
states. For detecting coevolutionary signal between
stacked residues in alpha helices, the reduced alphabets
which model charge/polarity perform the best. These
include the four CHARGE_* alphabets (CHARGE_2,
CHARGE_3, CHARGE_HIS_2, CHARGE_HIS_3) and the
alphabets based on Atchley factors 1 and 5. These would

not be the best alphabets if the interactions were based on
a different physicochemical property.
The success of charge-based alphabets for identifying
stacked positions in alpha helices confirms the previous
biochemical and statistical observations, and suggests that
alphabet recoding can be applied to probe interaction
types. For example, if a coevolutionary interaction is
apparent when working with a size-based alphabet, but
disappears when working with a charge-based alphabet,
the interaction is likely more related to size than charge.
This is observed when looking at (i, i + 1) pairs in the
myosin rod using MI with the SIZE_2 and CHARGE_3
alphabets (data not shown). Coevolution on the basis of
side-chain volume between (i, i + 1) pairs, which form the
set of residues which are presumably closest to oneanother in the folded protein, seems likely. Classification
of interaction types based on these characteristics is often
likely to be overly simplistic, but probing interactions this
way may serve as a starting point for more in-depth analysis. Care should be taken however to avoid spurious conclusions arising from multiple comparisons when
repeatedly applying a coevolution algorithm to the same
alignment recoded with multiple alphabets.
Utility of alpha-helical protein alignments for comparing
coevolution algorithms
This article presents a comparison of nine coevolution
detection methods on two different molecules which are
entirely (myosin rod) or almost entirely (myoglobin)
alpha helical. The two alignments are different in terms of
number of sequences, diversity of sequences, and
sequence length, yet in both cases the algorithms are able
to detect (to varying degrees) the periodicity of the alpha
helix. The coevolution of stacked residues in protein alpha
helices, identifiable computationally and supported by
double-mutant studies, makes alignments of alpha helices
useful for comparing techniques for detecting coevolution. Unfortunately, we cannot generalize this approach
to beta sheets, because the length of the beta strands is
highly variable and there is thus no consistent periodic
signal expected to be consistent across different proteins.

The CHARGE_HIS_2 alphabet, where residues are
recoded to charged or uncharged with histidine counted
as charged, was consistently among the best alphabets for
detecting coevolution at (i, i + 3) and (i, i + 4) in
myoglobin. Figure 7 reports p-values for ten algorithms
for detecting coevolution at (i, i + n), for n of 1 through 20,
where alignments were recoded in the CHARGE_HIS_2
alphabet. (In cases where this specific alphabet recoding
was not applicable – LnLCorr and CoMap – results represent the DEF99 and ORIG data sets, respectively.) These
graphs are a useful visualization of the relative performance of different algorithms or parameters because posi-

tive and negative controls are built-in. Since myoglobin is
composed of non-contiguous alpha helices, a signal
should be visible at n = 3 (i, i + 3) and n = 4 (i, i + 4), and
not at other values of n. We see that most of the methods
identify at least one of these with statistical significance,
even after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. AS appears to yield a false positive at n = 19.
Figure 8 reports p-values for Mutual Information at separations of 1 through 50 ((i, i + 1) through (i, i + 50)) in the
myosin rod with no alphabet recoding. Since the myosin
rod is a contiguous alpha helix and the input alignment
contains more data than the myoglobin alignment (in
terms of sequence length and number of sequences),
some weaker interactions become apparent. While (i, i +
3) and (i, i + 4) still generate the most significant p-values,
other pairs nearby in sequence also show significant p-values. Notably, multiples of seven between seven and thirtyfive obtain p-values suggestive of statistical significance,
likely resulting from longer-distance stacking interactions
in the myosin rod. Alpha helices allow for a comparison
of the power of each method not only to detect the
strongly coevolving pair sets, but possibly sets of pairs
undergoing weaker coevolution as well.
Long-distance signal in Myosin rod
Figure 8 illustrates that coevolutionary signal is periodically detectable at multiples of seven to distances of thirtyfive residues in the myosin rod. Two possible explanations for this signal are: (i) that direct interactions cause
coevolution between the residue pairs, or (ii) that indirect
interactions cause coevolution between the residue pairs
(e.g., residues 1 and 7 directly interact and coevolve, as do
residues 7 and 14, and an indirect correlation results in a
weaker signal between residues 1 and 14). The data support the latter explanation. The long distance interactions
detected in myosin should not be expected in myoglobin,
because unlike myosin, the alpha helices in myoglobin
are not contiguous.

The period of the alpha helix is 3.6. Direct interactions
due to stacking of more distant pairs should therefore
occur at multiples of 7.2 (rounded to 7, 14, 22, 29, 36, ...).
Instead, we see distant interactions at multiples of 7.0
(separations of 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 residues). This suggests that the direct interactions occur locally: we see a signal at 35, not at 36, because it is the result of a series of
direct local interactions (effectively) 7 positions apart.
The myosin rod is composed of 28 residue homologous
units, each composed of four heptad repeats. These repeat
regions could be an alternative explanation for the signal
at multiples of seven, but this seems less likely. Following
evolution of the myosin rod, it is not clear what would
drive coevolution of these units, and because conserva-

tion reduces MI for a pair of positions, the common ancestry followed by conservation would have the opposite
effect.
The process of coevolution is not well understood and
there has been very little conclusive evidence about the
forces driving coevolution in proteins. In the case of alpha
helices, it appears that distant coevolutionary relationships are the result of indirect correlations rather than residue stacking.

Conclusion
The analyses presented here support our conjecture that
robust estimation of coevolution hinges on comparison
to a null distribution with equivalent shared ancestry, and
that this property can be achieved without explicitly
including the tree in the coevolution metric. We demonstrated that transformed tree-ignorant methods detect
coevolution with equivalent or better power than treeaware methods when applied to detect the periodicity of
protein alpha helices. A useful next step would involve

confirming these results with other evaluations, perhaps
based on identifying positions proximal in tertiary structure or individual pairs of coevolving positions which
have been biochemically shown to coevolve. The robust
statistical properties of transformed tree-ignorant metrics
coupled with their generally many orders of magnitude
faster computational speed opens up new prospects for
detection of coevolving residues within and between proteins. We expect that the application of these methods on
a massive scale will provide new insights into the evolution of the structures, functions, and interactions of a wide
range of protein families.

Methods
Coevolution Detection Methods: tree-ignorant
Mutual Information
Mutual information (MI) was calculated over all pairs of
positions (columns) in the alignment, as described in
[21]. MI is a measure of the degree to which knowing the
value of one discrete random variable (in this case, the
identity of the amino acid residue at a specific position in
a protein) informs you of the value of another discrete
random variable (the identity of the residue at another
position). Pairs of positions with high MI scores are those
that have undergone correlated substitution events.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:327

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/327

Normalized Mutual Information
Normalized mutual information (NMI) was calculated by
dividing the MI score for each pair of alignment positions
by the joint entropy of that pair of positions. This normalization, as described in [21], attempts to reduce the minimizing effect of higher sequence conservation on mutual
information. For example, if two pairs of columns have
perfectly correlated substitutions, but one pair is more
highly conserved than the other, the more highly conserved pair will have a lower MI. Normalizing by joint
entropy combats this: the pairs will have equal NMI. This
method was reimplemented based on the description in
[21].

and verified the implementation using the Ranganathan
group's Matlab implementation and their published
results.

Resampled Mutual Information
Resampled mutual information (RMI), introduced here
for the first time, is similar to the Jackknife technique but
avoids the complication arising from deletion of observations. We use the same resampling approach as reported
previously for a tree-dependent probabilistic approach
[27] but apply it to the generation of a null distribution of
MI for data with arbitrary alphabet sizes. We note here
that when the branch lengths on a phylogeny are infinitely long, for a sample of n sequences the statistic from
the approach of [27] is equivalent to n times MI (Easton
and Huttley, unpublished). The resampling approach rescales MI by generating permutations of the data for the
pair of aligned columns. The modified data sets are identical to the observed data aside for a specific residue whose
observed state is replaced by one of the alternate states
present in other sequences at that position. As a result, the
modified data set has near identical shared ancestry. The
frequency with which such permuted data sets result in a
MI less than that from the observed data is taken as the
probability of observing a permutation with less dependence. Thus, RMI explicitly adjusts for shared ancestry and
computes probabilities of coevolution between residue
pairs.

Coevolution detection methods: tree-aware
Ancestral States
An ancestral-state-reconstruction-based method (AS) for
detecting coevolving positions was implemented based
on the method described in [4,17]. In this method, ancestral states are inferred for each internal node of the provided phylogenetic tree using maximum likelihood with a
substitution model calculated from the alignment and
tree. For each pair of positions in the alignment, all pairs
of organisms were evaluated to score position pairs on the
number of times both underwent a substitution since
their last common ancestor (LCA). Scores were calculated
as a weighted count of correlated substitutions, by summing the inverse branch lengths between organisms when
both residues had changed since the LCA. If neither or
only one residue changed since the LCA, nothing was
added to the score. This weighting has the effect of favoring correlated changes that happen closer to each other in
evolutionary time, since these are less likely to be the
results of random substitutions. (Many alternative scoring
methods are possible, and a comparison of the various
approaches is deferred to a future study.)

Statistical Coupling Analysis
Statistical coupling analysis (SCA) was calculated as
described in [12], and measures the change in distribution
of residues at one position associated with a change in the
distribution of residues at another position. If a correlated
change in the distribution of residues exists between a pair
of positions, that pair is said to be statistically coupled
and potentially coevolving.

In addition to the input alignment, SCA requires that the
percentage of sequences containing a fixed residue at a
position of interest be specified by the user (the cutoff
parameter). To study the effect of the cutoff parameter on
SCA's performance, we evaluated SCA using six cutoff values: 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9. We reimplemented
SCA based on the description of the algorithm in [12],

Corrected Mutual Information
Corrected mutual information (MIp) was calculated as
described in [22]. In attempt to control for 'background
MI', or MI arising from random variation or shared ancestry, MI scores are corrected by subtracting the product of
the mean MIs for the two positions divided by the overall
mean MI score. MIp data were calculated with a Perl
implementation of the algorithm provided by the
authors.

Coevolving pairs are expected to score higher than noncoevolving pairs. [17] illustrated that the method for
inferring ancestral sequences (parsimony or likelihood, in
their analysis), and the method for inferring the phylogenetic tree, have little effect on the ability of this method to
detect coevolution.
LnLCorr
LnLCorr is available in two versions from the authors. The
first (LnLCorr99) [5], is available as a C binary. The second (LnLCorr07) [7], is available as an open source MPI/
C++ package. We obtained different results with the different implementations, and therefore present data on both.
(Since the methods are very similar, we treat them as a single tree-aware method.) LnLCorr uses a likelihood ratio
(LR) to compare the probability of the data under independent and dependent models of evolution. In this
implementation, a larger LR between a pair of positions

Page 19 of 25
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:327

suggests coevolution. (When we refer to LnLCorr, we are
discussing properties of the algorithm common to the
LnLCorr99 and LnLCorr07 implementations.)
LnLCorr differs from the other methods presented in that
it incorporates its own amino acid alphabet reduction
step based on a residue metric provided by the user. Each
implementation is packaged with a default metric which
we refer to as DEF99 and DEF07. At each sequence position, the mean value of the metric is determined, and residues are categorized as above or below the mean. We
evaluated LnLCorr using the default metric in addition to
the five Atchley metrics (discussed below), but point out
that LnLCorr always recodes to a two-state alphabet. These
alphabets, while based on the same residue metrics as the
alphabets provided to our other methods, result in different encodings of the alignments for LnLCorr than for the
other algorithms.
Generalized continuous-time Markov process coevolutionary
algorithm
The generalized continuous-time Markov process coevolutionary algorithm (GCTMPCA) [3,6] employs maximum likelihood to determine if pairs of substitution
events are more likely under a dependent or independent
model of evolution. These data were calculated using the
C++ implementation provided by the authors as opensource software.

GCTMPCA requires a single parameter epsilon ( ), the penalty incurred for a single residue change (as opposed to a
correlated change between two residues), be provided by
the user. Based on empirical evidence the authors define
0.7 as the optimal value of . Unless otherwise noted we
use this default value, which we validated to be optimal
from a range of values. The instantaneous rate matrix for
single substitution events must also be provided by the
user. The authors use a rate matrix derived from the Dayhoff model [43], and we adopt that as the default. In our
studies using reduced amino acid alphabets, this matrix
was modified to represent substitution rates in the
reduced alphabet. To reduce the substitution matrix, we
collapsed the counts and frequencies from the original
Dayhoff data in accordance with the reduced amino acid
alphabet, and recalculated the instantaneous rate matrix.
CoMap
The CoMap algorithm is similar to AS in that it relies on
reconstruction of the ancestral states of all positions in the
alignment. However, instead of simply counting the
number of co-occurring substitutions, CoMap builds 'substitution vectors' for each position, where each element in
the vector represents a change in a corresponding branch
of the phylogenetic tree. Coevolving positions are identified as those with correlated substitution vectors.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/327

Two variants of CoMap were used in this study. The algorithm presented in [24] builds binary substitution vectors
indicating whether a substitution occurred on each
branch. In [20] an updated algorithm is presented which
incorporates 'weighted substitution vectors', which score
changes based on the difference in a pre-specified physicochemical property. Data computed with the binary substitution vector is presented as using an unreduced
alphabet (ORIG) since there is no adjustment made for
the physicochemical properties of the residues, and data
computed using the weighted vectors are presented as
reduced-state alphabets since they are designed to represent physicochemical properties of the residues. Three of
CoMap's built-in weighting schemes are evaluated
(GRANTHAM.POLARITY, GRANTHAM.VOLUME, and
CHARGE), in addition to weighting schemes based on the
five Atchley factors. CoMap data were calculated with
CoMap-1.3.0, provided by the authors.
Alignments and Trees
Myoglobin and Randomized Myoglobin
The first two alignments analyzed were a 153-position
myoglobin alignment containing sequences from 42
tetrapods, and a randomized version of this alignment
which was used as a negative control. Myoglobin is a
mostly alpha helical protein, and therefore serves as a
good test case for detecting alpha helix periodicity. This
alignment and the corresponding phylogenetic tree were
published with [5], where the details of its construction
can be found. This alignment contains one gap in one
sequence.

The randomized myoglobin alignment was generated by
reordering the columns, thereby removing all structural
information. Because the periodicity of the alpha helix
should no longer be detectable, this alignment served as a
negative control. The randomized alignment used the
same tree as the myoglobin alignment.
For the purpose of alphabet recoding, it was necessary to
replace ambiguous characters in the alignments with nonambiguous characters. The five B characters and two Z
characters in the myoglobin alignment were replaced with
D and E, respectively. D and E were chosen over N and Q
based on residue frequency in the full alignment. No X
characters were present in the myoglobin alignment.
Myosin Rod Domain and Randomized Myosin Rod Domain
The myosin heavy chain alignment was originally constructed for the MyoMapr database [44] with ClustalW
[14], and subsequently adjusted using PyCogent [45].
Sequences that introduced gaps in other sequences were
deleted, as were sequences that contained gaps that were
not shared by other sequences at the 99.5% gap identity
level (i.e. pairs of sequences left in the alignment were

Page 20 of 25

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:327

99.5% identical in gap pattern over the aligned region). A
subalignment consisting of only the rod domain was used
as the second alpha helical data set.
The rod domain of myosin is a continuous alpha helix
which forms a coiled-coil homodimer. This alignment
contains 1064 positions, is derived from 114 chordate
sequences, and contains no gaps or ambiguous characters.
The positions in this alignment were also shuffled to serve
as a negative control. A phylogenetic tree was constructed
by neighbor-joining [46]. Since the alignment represents
a continuous alpha helix, it is ideal for detecting alpha
helix periodicity.
Amino acid alphabets
Atchley-factor alphabets
Atchley et al. (2005) calculated values for the twenty
canonical amino acid residues by reducing 54 amino acid
attributes to five condensed metrics using factor analysis.
We used these five metrics (A1 – A5) to define reducedstate amino acid alphabets of varied sizes. To define each
'Atchley-factor alphabet,' we ordered the amino acid residues based on their values for each metric, and then
grouped neighboring residues into n roughly equal sized
groups, where n ranged from 2 through 10. Each of the
five Atchley factors was used to define nine Atchley-factor
alphabets, resulting in forty-five reduced alphabets. We
refer to each of these alphabets based on the factor they
are derived from and the alphabet size. For example, A1_4
refers to the four-state alphabet derived from Atchley-factor 1 (A1).

The five factors are described in [42] as follows: A1,
related to residue polarity; A2, related to propensity for
different secondary structures; A3, a molecular size/volume factor; A4, related to amino acid composition in proteins and number of codons; and A5, a electrostatic charge
factor.
Canonical reduced alphabets
We broke the full twenty-state amino acid alphabet into
seven additional reduced-state alphabets based on four
commonly recognized features of amino acids: hydropathy index (a three-state alphabet), charge with histidine
treated as a charged residue (two- and three-state alphabets), charge with histidine treated as an uncharged residue (two- and three-state alphabets), polarity (a four-state
alphabet), and size (a two-state alphabet). These reduced
alphabets were generated by splitting the full alphabet
based on natural breaks in the properties of the amino
acids, and we therefore refer to these as 'rationallydesigned' alphabets (as opposed to the heuristically
defined Atchley-factor alphabets).

All amino acid alphabet definitions are presented in Table
5.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/327

Correlations between alphabet size and performance
Kendall's tau ( ) rank correlation test was applied to compute correlation coefficients ( ) and p-values for the relationship between alphabet size and method performance.
For each Atchley-factor alphabet, the performance at each
alphabet size (2 states through 10 states, and the full
twenty-state alphabet) were ranked, and the ranks compared against the rank alphabet size to determine if there
was a correlation between alphabet size and performance.
Performance ranking for a method/alphabet combination
was performed based on the -log(p-value) for identifying
(i, i + 4) pairs as different from the background signal. The
(i, i + 4) pairs were chosen over the (i, i + 3) pairs to define
significance because these are generally where the strongest signals were observed for either method, and the biochemical data more strongly support these interactions. A
positive indicates that an increase in the number of states
is correlated with an increase in performance.
Detecting periodicity of the alpha helix
To detect coevolutionary signal resulting from the periodicity of the alpha helix, we compiled coevolution scores
for pairs of positions differing by n in position number, or
(i, i + n) pairs. For each value of n, we compared the distribution of scores for the (i, i + n) pairs to the distribution
of all other positions pairs in the alignment (the background distribution) using a one-tailed (Ha: other < n), twosample t-test. For example, to look for coevolutionary signal between positions separated by three residues (i, i +
4), we compared the distribution of coevolution scores at
position pairs {(1,5), (2,6), (3,7), (4,8), ...} with the distribution of all other positions pair coevolution scores
{(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,6), ..., (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,7), ...}.
When sample sizes are large, the two-sample t-test is
robust to deviations of the background distribution from
normality and differences in the population sample sizes,
making it suitable for this application. An important feature of this test is that methods with higher false positive
rates do not achieve more significant p-values. This is
because the higher false positive rate tends to increase the
coevolution scores of all pairs, thus elevating the background distribution and resulting in a less significant pvalue [see Additional file 3].

The multiple comparisons problem is significant, but is
unavoidable in full-molecule coevolutionary analyses. We
present exact p-values from all tests in relation to several
baselines, including the Bonferroni-adjusted alpha to
control for multiple comparisons. The Bonferroni adjustment circumvents the multiple comparison problem, but
is often considered too stringent, greatly decreasing the
power of the statistical test.
The distance matrix structure of the result matrices violates the independence clause of the t-test. To determine if
this affected the conclusions, p-values were computed

The 52 reduced-state amino acid alphabets. Each state is defined as a group of characters followed by a semi-colon, so for example, 'KRDEH' and
'ACFGILMNPQSTVWY' are reduced to the charged and uncharged states, respectively, in the CHARGE_HIS_2 alphabet.

empirically using a non-parametric matrix permutation
test [47] for several result matrices. (This method is very
computationally intensive, so was not applied to all
results.) Results suggest that the p-values obtained from
the t-tests are sometimes exaggerated, but the ranking of
p-values is consistent. The coevolution score distributions
are not normal (see Figure 1), which is also potentially
problematic for the t-test. To address this, we applied the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test (implemented in the R statistical
package) to confirm the results of our t-test p-values, for a
selection of result matrices and negative controls. The Wilcoxon p-values also suggest that the t-test p-values are
sometimes exaggerated, but rank similarly to the t-test pvalues. These results support the use of t-test for comparing the performance of algorithms.
Identifying individual coevolving pairs
To identify individual coevolving pairs, coevolution
scores corresponding to each pair of positions were compared to all coevolution scores in the same matrix using
one-observation t-tests to generate a p-value matrix indicating the statistical significance of each score. Significance thresholds ( ) were varied from 1.0 × 10-2 and 1.0 ×
10-7 in steps of one order of magnitude, and statistically
significant scores corresponding to (i, i + 3) and (i, i + 4)
pairs were counted as true positives (TP). Statistically significant scores corresponding to all other position pairs
were counted as false positives (FP). Scores corresponding
to (i, i + 3) and (i, i + 4) pairs which were not statistically
significant were counted as false negatives (FN). This
allowed for calculation of precision (P) as TP/(TP + FP), or
statistically significant scores arising from the periodicity
of the alpha helix, divided by the total number of statistically significant scores (total hits); and calculation of
recall (R) as TP/(TP + FN), or statistically significant scores
arising from the periodicity of the alpha helix, divided by
the total number of (i, i + 3) and (i, i + 4) pairs. We note
that pairs are expected to coevolve for effects other than
the stability of the alpha helix, and our false positive
count is therefore contaminated with many scores which
should be counted as true positives. Similarly, not all

stacked positions in the alpha helix are expected to coevolve, and our false negative count is therefore contaminated with many true negatives. Since the exact set of
coevolving positions is not known, it is not possible to
adjust these counts accordingly. This issue is common to
all methods however, so while the true precisions and
recalls are likely significantly higher than those presented
here, the relative values should be meaningful comparisons of the methods. While for simplicity we refer to these
scores as precision and recall, more accurately precision
can be described as the proportion of statistically significant coevolution scores associated with pairs of stacked
positions in the alpha helix, and recall can be described as
the proportion of stacked positions observed to coevolve.
We additionally summarize these statistics by presenting
F-measures, the harmonic mean of precision and recall,
calculated as (2 × P × R)/(P + R).
Precision, recall, F-measure, and total hits data are summarized with area under the curve (AUC) scores for each
method, alphabet combination. Six variates of were
tested, and AUC was calculated for each metric (Figure 4).
Each step in contributed an equal length to the area
under that segment of the curve (log10 2- log10 1, opposed
to 2 - 1). If no statistically significant scores were returned
for one value of (i.e., total hits = 0), precision could not
be calculated because the denominator was equal to zero.
For these values of , precision was set to zero to facilitate
the calculation of AUC. Similarly, when precision and
recall were both equal to zero, F-measure could not be calculated and was therefore set to zero. This is convenient
because, for example, if a method, alphabet combination
achieved no statistically significant hits for any value of ,
precision AUC was equal to zero. All precision, recall, Fmeasure, total hits, and AUC data are provided [see Additional file 1].
χ2 comparisons of tree-aware and tree-ignorant methods
The tree-aware and tree-ignorant categories were compared using 2 goodness-of-fit tests (Table 1). A 2 × 2 contingency table was compiled by counting the runs

(algorithm/alphabet combinations) in each category
which identify a set of pairs as statistically significant with
= 0.01. We evaluated performance for identifying (i, i +
3) pairs and (i, i + 4) pairs in myosin and myoglobin. In
each case, counts were tallied using the best and worst performing SCA cutoff values. (SCA cutoff values obtaining
the most and least significant median p-values at (i, i + 3)
and (i, i + 4) in each alignment were selected as the best
and worst SCA sets, respectively. For example, the (i, i + 3)
myoglobin tree-ignorant counts in row 1 of Table 1A, and
the associated negative control, use cutoff = 0.90 because
those values achieved the highest median p-value for that
specific data point.) Because SCA performance varies
widely with the cutoff value (see Figure 6), and optimization is not always practical, it is useful to see how the
methods compare when the best and worst cutoff values
are used. Tree-aware counts are always tallied using
GCTMPCA runs with the recommended and empirically
validated optimal value of = 0.70.

Comparisons of the tree-aware methods (Table 2) and the
tree-ignorant methods (Table 3) were performed similarly. For both categories, 4 × 2 contingency tables were
compiled by counting the significant and insignificant
scores at (i, i + 3) and (i, i + 4), with a = 0.01. LnLCorr07
and GCTMPCA were not included in the comparison on
myosin because the computation time was prohibitive.
Counts for GCTMPCA on myoglobin were compiled with
= 0.70. All tree-ignorant methods were compared on
myoglobin and myosin, and counts were compiled using
the empirically determined optimal SCA cutoff values for
each data point.
Availability of algorithms and data
MI, NMI, RMI, SCA, and AS were implemented in Python
and are available as part of the open source PyCogent
project [45]. A PyCogent application controller, also available in PyCogent, was developed for GCTMPCA. The original source code for SCA, MIp, and CoMap; the
LnLCorr99 command line application; and the
LnLCorr07 source code and command line application
are available upon request from their authors. The alignment and trees used in these analyses are available in fasta
and newick format, respectively [see Additional file 4].
Documentation for regenerating all coevolution score
matrices from these alignments and trees is provided [see
