Abstract
Background: The pig-tailed macaques are the only Old World monkeys known to be susceptible
to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. We have previously reported that the
TRIM5-Cyclophilin A (TRIMCyp) fusion in pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) is dysfunctional in
restricting HIV-1, which may explain why pig-tailed macaques are susceptible to HIV-1 infection.
Similar results have also been reported by other groups. However, according to the current
primate taxonomy, the previously reported M. nemestrina are further classified into three species,
which all belong to the Macaca spp. This calls for the need to look into the previous studies in more
details.
Results: The local species Northern pig-tailed macaque (M. leonina) was analyzed for the
correlation of TRIM5 structure and HIV-1 infection. Eleven M. leonina animals were analyzed, and
all of them were found to possess TRIM5-CypA fusion at the TRIM5 locus. The transcripts encoding
the dysfunctional TRIM5-CypA should result from the G-to-T mutation in the 3'-splicing site of
intron 6. Polymorphism in the putative TRIMCyp recognition domain was observed. The peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of M. leonina were susceptible to HIV-1 infection. Consistent
with the previous results, expression of the M. leonina TRIMCyp in HeLa-T4 cells rendered the cells
resistant to HIV-2ROD but not to SIVmac239 infection.
Conclusion: The susceptibility of M. leonina to HIV-1 infection is due to the dysfunctional TRIM5CypA fusion in the TRIM5 locus. This finding should broaden our perspective in developing better
HIV/AIDS non-human primate animal models.

Background
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) originated from cross-species transmission from chimpanzees
to humans and is the major causative agent of human
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic
[1-3]. Although HIV-1 infects human CD4+ cells, it does
not infect most non-human primates (NHP). Studies
using Vesicular Stomatitis virus G-glycoprotein (VSV-G)
pseudotyped viruses, which bypass the receptor restriction, revealed that species-specific host factors restrict
HIV-1 infection [4]. For example, the host restriction factor tripartite motif protein 5α (TRIM5α) potently blocks
HIV-1 replication in rhesus macaque (M. mulatta)
through species-specific post-entry restriction in Old
World monkeys [5].
TRIM5α is a member of the TRIM family, which contains
the RING, B-Box2 and coiled-coil domains, and a C-terminal B30.2/SPRY domain. TRIM5α interacts with the capsid (CA) portion of HIV-1 Gag protein through its B30.2/
SPRY domain, which determines the specificity and
potency of TRIM5α restriction to retroviruses [5,6]. Host
protein cyclophilin A (CypA) interacts with the CA
through incorporation into HIV-1 particles, and modulates HIV-1 replication in host cells [7-9]. It has been documented that in Old World monkey cells, CypA is
required for TRIM5α-mediated resistance to HIV-1 [10].
The New World primate owl monkey (Aotus) expresses a
TRIM5-CypA (TRIMCyp) fusion protein, in which the
B30.2/SPRY domain of TRIM5α is replaced by CypA
resulting from retrotransposition of the CypA pseudogene
cDNA into the seventh intron at the TRIM5 locus. The owl
monkey TRIM5-CypA (omTRIMCyp) restricts several retroviruses including HIV-1, simian immunodeficiency
virus (SIV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)
[11,12]. Recently, we and others reported that in pigtailed macaques the B30.2/SPRY domain is replaced by
retrotransposed CypA in the 3'-UTR of TRIM5 in a fashion
different from that in the owl monkey, resulting in the

failure of restriction to HIV-1 replication in pig-tailed
macaques [13-17].
According to the current widely-accepted primate taxonomy based on more morphological studies and phylogeographic analyses, the previously reported Macaca
nemestrina group is divided into three species: Sunda pigtailed macaque (M. nemestrina), Northern pig-tailed
macaque (M. leonina), and Mentawai macaque (M. pagensis) [18-21]. The M. nemestrina distributes in Malay Peninsula from about 7°30'N, Sumatra, Bangka and Borneo.
The M. leonina ranges from about 8°N in Peninsular Thailand, through Burma and Indochina into Bangladesh,
India extending north as far as to the Brahmaputra, and
the southernmost Yunnan, China. The M. pagensis locates
in the Mentawai islands [18]. The previously studied pigtailed macaques may contain individuals of different species. Here, we analyzed the susceptibility of the local species M. leonina in Yunnan to HIV-1 infection and the
TRIM5 locus. The fusion pattern of TRIMCyp and the polymorphism of the TRIMCyp recognition domain in M.
leonina were characterized.

Results
Characterization of the TRIMCyp fusion gene in M.
leonina
To investigate the correlation between the TRIM5α
sequence and the susceptibility to infection by HIV-1 in
M. leonina, the genomic sequence of the TRIM5 locus of
11 animals from several different populations was analyzed (Table 1). A pair of specific PCR primers was
designed based on the human TRIM5 genomic sequence,
with the forward primer in the TRIM5 exon 8 and the
reverse primer in the adjacent genomic region after TRIM5
3'-UTR (Table 2). A fragment of about 2, 800 bp was
amplified (Fig. 1A), indicating that the TRIM5 locus is
longer than normal and thus the TRIM5-CypA pattern
might exist. To confirm this notion, another pair of primers was designed, with the forward one in exon 8 and the

reverse one in the CypA sequence (Table 2). Indeed, a
CypA cDNA sequence is inserted in the TRIM5 locus in all
M. leonina (Fig. 1B, C), which disrupts the normal TRIM5.
To further characterize the CypA insertion in the TRIM5
locus, we performed several other PCR reactions with different pairs of primers (Table 2). The PCR products were
recovered and sequenced. The sequencing results revealed
that the CypA pseudogene cDNA insertion in the TRIM5
locus resulted from a LINE (long interspersed nuclear element)-1-mediated retrotransposition (Fig. 1D), which is
very common in mammals [22,23].
Expression of TRIMCyp fusion gene in M. leonina
To test whether the TRIMCyp fusion gene in M. leonina is
transcribed to produce mature transcripts, the RNAs from
8 M. leonina samples were reverse transcribed and PCR
amplified using specific primers TRIMCypF and TRIMCypR (Table 2). Multiple mature TRIMCyp transcripts
with different lengths were detected in eight M. leonina
samples, but not in the Chinese rhesus macaque samples
(data not shown). Sequencing analysis of the PCR products revealed that both exon 7 and exon 8 were spliced out
in all major isoforms leaving exon 6 fused to the CypA
cDNA in frame (data not shown), as previously reported
[13-16].

To understand why exons 7 and 8 were not included in
the mature transcripts, the sequences of introns 6 and 7
were analyzed for aberrant splicing sites. The Nsi I restriction site upstream the 3' splicing site of intron 6 has been
reported to be closely linked to the mutation within the
site [17], which allowed a convenient screening of the Gto-T substitution in the splicing site (Fig. 2B). Analysis of
the PCR product flanking intron 6 by the Nsi I restriction
digestion revealed that all M. leonina were homozygous
for the Nsi I site (Fig. 2A). The G-to-T substitution in the
3' splicing site of intron 6 was confirmed by sequencing
analysis of the PCR products in all the M. leonina samples
(Fig. 2B). The G-to-T substitution in the 3' splicing site of

intron 6 should prevent the inclusion of exon 7 during
splicing. Sequencing analysis revealed that the 3' splicing
site of intron 7 was normal (data not shown). The exclusion of exon 8 in the mature transcript is likely the result
of alternative splicing, as previously observed [13].
Polymorphism analysis in the TRIMCyp recognition
domain
A fragment of 3348 bp from intron 6 to the 3' genomic
adjacent region was analyzed for polymorphisms via
DnaSP 4.5 program [24,25]. In the 11 Northern pig-tailed
macaques, a total of 46 polymorphic nucleotide sites were
identified, including 40 Singleton variable sites and 6 Parsimony informative sites (Fig. 3A). Among these sites, 16
sites (site 579, 592, 613, 796, 803, 883, 925, 1026, 1087,
2134, 2251, 2303, 2415, 2494, 2506 and 2529) are in the
coding region (39%), and the others (site 169, 248, 252,
350, 364, 462, 1262, 1265, 1440, 1718, 1719, 1721,
1723, 1759, 1765, 1912, 2034, 2037, 2057, 2075, 2740,
2749, 2802, 2868, 2907, 2950, 3016, 3031, 3277 and
3282) are in the noncoding region. There are 15 nonsynonymous variation sites in the coding region, except for
the synonymous site 2303. In KMZ-4, we identified an
insertion-mutation, which results in frame shift relative to
the coding region (data no shown). Next, we sought to
determine whether the observed polymorphisms are consonant with the real status. Linkage disequilibrium (LD)
describes a situation in which some combinations of alleles or genetic markers occur more or less frequently in a
population than would be expected from a random formation of haplotypes from alleles based on their frequencies. The occurrence of LD permits the construction of
Haplotype. The LD analysis (Fisher's exact test and Chisquare test) showed that no recombinant event occurred,
and the degree of LD is strong (P < 0.001) (Fig. 3B). Additionally, the Neutrality theory was used to detect the intraspecific polymorphism level, and two approaches
(Tajama's D test and Fu and Li's D test) based on different
algorithm models were employed. The Neutrality test of
Tajama's D test demonstrated no statistical significance in

and Li's D test were significant (P < 0.005) (Fig. 3C).
The coding sequences of TRIMCyp exon 7, exon 8 and
CypA from M. leonina were assembled to deduce the putative amino acid sequences. The phylogenetic tree based on
the putative amino acid sequences demonstrated that the
11 M. leonina are divided into several major subgroups
(Fig. 4A), which may explain the high polymorphic in this
region. In the Aotus and Macaca TRIMCyp proteins, the
CypA part is the recognition domain mediating the binding of the fusion protein to the incoming viral capsids.
The putative amino acid sequences of the CypA domain

from various species were aligned. No major differences
were found in sequences of CypA inserted in TRIMCyp
from diverse M leonina. The results clearly show that the
sequences are homologous among the Old World
macaque M. leonina, M. nemestrina and M. mullata species,
while the M. fasciculari and the New World monkey A. trivirgatus were much less homologous (Fig. 4B). In addition, some amino acids critical for the restriction of HIV1 in A. trivirgatus, such as N66 and H69, were observed in
M. leonina. The phylogenetic tree among these primates
was constructed based on the inserted CypA amino acid
sequences. The result revealed that the Macaca spp species
members M. leonina, M. nemestrina and M. mulatta were

relatively close in homology, the M. fasciculari and the
New World monkey A. trivirgatus were in two obviously
more distant groups (Fig. 4C).
Susceptibility of M. leonina PBMCs to HIV-1 infection
To determine the susceptibility of M. leonina to infection
by HIV-1, the PBMCs were isolated from EDTA K2-treated
whole blood. The PBMCs from M. mulatta, which are
known to be resistant to HIV-1 infection, were used as a
negative control, and the PBMCs from human, which are
known to be susceptible to HIV-1 infection, were used as
a positive control. The susceptible human T cell line MT4, the monocyte cell line U937, and the resistant Chinese
rhesus macaque transformed B lymphocyte cell line were
also used as controls. The cells were challenged with VSVG pseudotyped HIV-1 carrying the GFP reporter (HIVGFP-VSVG) at the infection unit (IU) of 0.1 and 0.5. The
percentage of GFP positive cells counted by FACS analysis
was used as an indicator for the susceptibility of the cells
to HIV-1 infection. As expected, the M. mulatta PBMCs
were relatively resistant to HIV-1 infection (Fig. 5A). In
comparison, the M. leonina PBMCs demonstrated a magnitude of susceptibility to HIV-GFP-VSVG infection comparable to the human PBMCs (Fig. 5A). These results
established that the M. leonina are susceptible to HIV-1
infection.

To test whether the M. leonina TRIMCyp can restrict other
retroviruses, we generated HeLa-T4 cell lines expressing Cterminally HA-tagged TRIMCyp of M. leonina and A. trivirgatus. The expression of the TRIMCyp fusion proteins
(npmTRIMCyp for northern pigtailed macaque TRIMCyp
and omTRIMCyp for owl monkey TRIMCyp) was confirmed by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 5B). The cells
were challenged with HIV-2ROD (MOI = 0.02). Replication
of the virus in these cells was evaluated by measuring the
capsid p27 antigen levels. The results demonstrated that
both npmTRIMCyp and omTRIMCyp actively restricted
HIV-2ROD by about 16-fold (Fig. 5C). The cells were also
assayed for their restriction to SIVmac239 replication. The
npmTRIMCyp demonstrated very moderate restriction
activity, while the omTRIMCyp could not inhibit
SIVmac239 replication (Fig. 5C).

Discussion
Because of their close evolutionary relationship to
humans, NHPs are of vital importance in biomedical
research and are often the best or only animal models for
controlled experiments relevant to a range of human diseases and disorders. Macaque infection models provide
unique opportunities for generating discoveries that may
lead to new therapeutic options, improved vaccine strategies, and increased preparedness for future disease outbreaks. Among Old World monkeys, the pig-tailed
macaques (M. nemestrina) were reported to be prone to

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/58

HIV-1 infection with AIDS-like symptoms [26-29]. We
and other groups identified TRIMCyp fusion protein
expression in pig-tailed macaques. However, the fusion
protein failed to restrict HIV-1 replication when expressed
in some non-restrictive human or macaque cell lines [1317].
Interestingly, the aforementioned pig-tailed macaques are
divided into three macaque species according to current
primate taxonomy [18]. Understanding the relationship
between the TRIM5 locus and the susceptibility to HIV-1
in these species is urgently required. Here, we surveyed the
M. leonina in Yunnan province, China. The results showed
that the PBMCs of M. leonina are susceptible to HIV-1
infection, a finding which is consistent with previous
results [13-17]. Moreover, the M. leonina fusion protein
npmTRIMCyp can potently block HIV-2ROD, which may
account for the different modulatory roles of host cell
CypA, as the CypA is incorporated into HIV-1 but not
HIV-2. Some other mechanisms may also exist, and one
needs more work to dissect these possibilities. The same
fusion pattern of TRIM5-CypA gene was observed in all the
11 surveyed M. leonina animals. Although it has been
reported that both M. nemestrina and M. mulatta express
TRIMCyp fusion proteins [15-17], our results suggest that
the frequency of TRIM5-CypA fusion is higher in M.
leonina than in M. mulatta. Further studies suggest that the
fusion results from the insertion of the CypA pseudogene
cDNA into the 3'-UTR of TRIM5 through the LINE-1-element-mediated retrotransposition. The transcription
products of TRIM5-CypA were also detected in M. leonina
PBMCs, and the transcript formation was attributed to the
G-to-T substitution in the 3'-splicing site of TRIM5 intron
6 in macaques 17. In the human genome, more than 60
processed CypA pseudogenes were reported across the
genome by retrotransposition [30]. In New World primates, the TRIM5-CypA fusion gene was only identified in
Aotus species, and the CypA exposed positive selection in
the evolutionary history [31]. However, what drove the
CypA pseudogene cDNA retrotransposition into the
TRIM5 locus twice in the New World and Old World primates independently? These questions call for more
genetic research to delineate the mechanistic details.
Host genetic variations have important impact on the susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. TRIM5α restricts HIV-1
through the B30.2/SPRY domain specifically recognizing
and interacting with the CA protein. In owl monkey, the
CypA copy in the TRIMCyp fusion protein can bind lentiviral CA and block their replication [11,12]. In pig-tailed
macaques, CypA pseudogene cDNA substituted the B30.2/
SPRY in the TRIM5α, resulting in the formation of the
TRIMCyp fusion gene. Virgen et al. suggested that the
TRIMCyp protein from M. nemestrina does not bind to
HIV-1 CA because of the single amino acid (R69H) muta-

Restriction activities of M. leonina TRIMCyp on lentiviruses
Restriction activities of M. leonina TRIMCyp on lentiviruses. (A) The indicated cells were infected with HIV-GFP-VSVG
at the indicated infection unit (IU). IU = 0.1 or 0.5 denotes 10-fold or 2-fold dilution of HIV-GFP-VSVG viral stocks, respectively. Percentage of infected cells was counted 48 hours later by FACS analysis of GFP positive cells. The result is representative of three independent experiments. npmPBMC: northern pig-tailed macaque PBMC; huPBMC: human PBMC; rhPBMC:
rhesus PBMC; MT-4: human T cell line MT-4; U937: human monocyte line U937; rh B: a Chinese rhesus macaque transformed
B immortalized cell line. (B) The HA-tagged TRIMCyp cloned from northern pig-tailed macaque and owl monkey TRIMCyp
were stably expressed in HeLa-T4 cells. The expression of the proteins was confirmed by Western blotting. (C) The cells were
infected with HIV-2ROD or SIVmac239 virus at MOI (multiplicity of infection) = 0.02. Four days post-infection, the capsid p27
antigen levels in the culture supernatants were measured by quantitative ELISA assays. The result is representative of three
independent experiments.
tion in the TRIMCyp-CA interaction interface [15]. Interestingly, the npmTRIMCyp also contains the R69H
mutation in the CypA domain, which may partly explain
why the npmTRIMCyp cannot restrict HIV-1. The recognition domain of M. leonina TRIMCyp is relatively highly
polymorphic. It would be interesting to analyze whether
the specific polymorphism affects the sensitivity of the
primates to HIV-1 infection. It might be possible to establish optimal HIV/AIDS NHP models in M. leonina through
screening macaques that possess SNPs more susceptible to
HIV-1 infection.
In conclusion, the TRIM5-CypA fusion in M. leonina
maybe a pivotal factor associated with their susceptibility
to HIV-1. The M. leonina appears to be a good candidate
for an HIV/AIDS animal model. Our results should
broaden the perspective in developing better HIV/AIDS
NHP animal models.

Materials and methods
Animals
Northern pig-tailed macaques KMZ-1, KMZ-2, KMZ -4
and KMZ-5 were bred in the Kunming Zoo (KMZ), animals 524, 528, 551, 87015, 93201, 97203 and 99201
were raised in the Kunming Institute of Zoology (KIZ),
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) (Table 1). The Chinese rhesus macaque 95005 was raised in the KIZ, CAS.
Whole blood from these animals was collected in EDTAK2
Blood Collection Tubes following the National Experimental Animal Handling Ordinance.
RNA/DNA samples
PBMCs were isolated from EDTA K2-treated whole blood
by EZ-Sep™ Monkey 9× (Dakewe Biotech) or FicollHypaque density centrifugation. Total RNA was isolated
from 8 × 106 PBMCs using the RNAprep Cell Kit (Tiangen)
following the manufacturer's instruction. Genomic DNA
was isolated from 300 μl whole blood using the Puregene
DNA Purification Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's handbook.

Genomic DNA Amplification and Sequencing
The PCR primers for amplifying the genomic DNA from
intron 6 to the 3' flanking sequence (Table 2) were
designed based on the sequences published in Genbank
(accession numbers EU371641 and NT_009237). The
fragments were amplified using LATaq-PCR or ExTaq-PCR
kit (TaKaRa), purified with DNA Gel Extraction Kit
(Watson Biotech), and cloned into the pMD 19-T Simple
vector (TaKaRa), clones were picked up for sequencing
analysis.

To screen for the G-to-T mutation associated with the 3'splicing site within TRIM5 intron 6, the fragment encompassing the 3'-splicing site in intron 6 was PCR amplified
with the sense primer T5in6F1 and the anti-sense primer
T5ex8R3. The PCR products were digested with restriction
endonuclease Nsi I (Fermentas), followed by electrophoresis in a 1.4% agarose gel [17]. In addition, the PCR
products were purified and cloned for sequencing analysis.
cDNA Amplification
Primers TRIMCypF and TRIMCypR (Table 2) for amplification of the complete coding sequence of Northern pigtailed macaques TRIM5 have been described previously
[13]. The total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA
using the PrimeScript 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit
(TaKaRa) following the manufacturer's instruction. The
PCR condition was: 94°C for 2 minutes; 30 cycles of 94°C
for 30 seconds, 55°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 1.5
minutes; held at 72°C for 7 minutes, and stored at 4°C.
Sequence analysis
The sequences were assembled with the Contig program,
and aligned by the Clustal X 1.83 or DNAStar 7.1.0 (Lasergene) software. Nucleotide sequence polymorphisms
were analyzed by DnaSP 4.50 program. Neighbor-joining
nucleotide tree of primate TRIMCyp was constructed via
MEGA 3.1 program, bootstrap values were based on 1,000
replicates. Representative species of Aotus trivirgirtas was
used as outgroup. The reference sequence accession num-

bers are: EU371639, EU371641, EU328216, AY646199,
EU328216.
Cell culture, transfection, and infection assay
Primates and human PBMCs were isolated by EZ-Sep
monkey 9× or Ficoll-Hypaque PBMCs separation solution. PBMCs were cultured in RPMI 1640 complete
medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 IU/ml Interleukin-2
(IL-2) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 72 hours to activate the cells.
Human T lymphocyte MT-4, monocyte U937, and a transformed Chinese rhesus macaque B lymphocyte line were
cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium. Activated
PBMCs were seeded at the density of 5 × 105 cells/well in
the 96-well plate, and the control cell lines were seeded at
4 × 105 cells/well. The HIV-GFP-VSVG viral stocks were
thawed in a room temperature water bath, diluted with
culture medium supplemented with 20 mM pH7.5
HEPES and 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich) on the ice.
The cells were infected for 4 hours in the 37°C, 5% CO2
chamber, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), and then cultured in fresh RPMI 1640 complete
medium. After 48 hours post-infection, the percentage of
GFP positive cells was counted by FACS analysis using a
FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson).

HeLa-T4 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with
10% fetal calf serum (GIBCO), penicillin (Sigma), and
streptomycin (Invitrogen). The C-terminally avian influenza Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged TRIMCyp cDNA recombinant pLPCX expression plasmids of M. leonina and A.
trivirgatus were constructed and transfected as previously
described [13], npmTRIMCyp and omTRIMCyp expression in HeLa-T4 cells were detected by Western blot for
the HA-tag, β-actin as a loading control. HeLa-T4 cells stably expressing TRIMCyp proteins were seeded in the 24well plate at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well. On the following day, the cells were inoculated with viruses (MOI =
0.02) at 37°C for 2 hours. The cells were washed twice
with PBS and cultured in 500 μl of fresh DMEM complete
medium at 37°C, 5% CO2. Culture supernatants were
harvested in duplicate on day 4 post-infection. The levels
of HIV-2ROD and SIVmac239 capsid proteins in the
medium were quantified by a p27-specific SIV p27 antigen ELISA kit (Zeptometrix).
