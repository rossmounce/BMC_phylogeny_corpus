Abstract
Background: Sloths are slow-moving arboreal mammals inhabiting tropical rainforests in Central and South
America. The six living species of sloths are occasionally reported to display a greenish discoloration of their
pelage. Trichophilus welckeri, a green algal species first described more than a century ago, is widely believed to
discolor the animals fur and provide the sloth with effective camouflage. However, this phenomenon has not been
explored in any detail and there is little evidence to substantiate this widely held opinion.
Results: Here we investigate the genetic diversity of the eukaryotic community present in fur of all six extant
species of sloth. Analysis of 71 sloth hair samples yielding 426 partial 18S rRNA gene sequences demonstrates a
diverse eukaryotic microbial assemblage. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that sloth fur hosts a number of green algal
species and suggests that acquisition of these organisms from the surrounding rainforest plays an important role in
the discoloration of sloth fur. However, an alga corresponding to the morphological description of Trichophilus
welckeri was found to be frequent and abundant on sloth fur. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the retention of
this alga on the fur of sloths independent of geographic location.
Conclusions: These results demonstrate a unique diverse microbial eukaryotic community in the fur of sloths from
Central and South America. Our analysis streghtens the case for symbiosis between sloths and Trichophilus welckeri.

Background
The extant sloths comprise six species of medium-sized
slow-moving mammals of Central and South America.
They are represented by two distantly related genera
Bradypus, three-toed sloths, and Choloepus, two-toed
sloths. The genus Bradypus has four extant species:
Bradypus variegatus, B. tridactylus, B. torquatus and B.
pygmaeus. Bradypus variegatus, the brown-throated
sloth, is the most widespread species and inhabits Central and Southern American rainforests, whereas B. tridactylus, the pale-throated sloth, is restricted to
northern South America. Bradypus torquatus, the
maned three-toed sloth, occupies a diminishing area of

coastal forests of eastern Brazil, and B. pygmaeus, the
pygmy three-toed sloth, only recently described, is
endemic to the small island, Isla Escudo de Veraguas
on the Atlantic coast of Panama [1]. The genus Choloepus is represented by two living species: Choloepus
hoffmanni, the Hoffmann’s two-toed sloth, and
C. didactylus, the southern two-toed sloth. Choloepus
hoffmanni occurs in Central America, and in South
America close to the equator, and C. didactylus is
restricted to northern South America [2].
Sloth hair is long and coarse and that of two-toed
sloths is unique in having a number of deep grooves
running the length of each hair, whereas three-toed
sloth hair has irregular transverse cracks that increase in
number and size with age [3,4]. A wide variety of organisms have been reported to occur in the grooves and
cracks of sloth hair, including cyanobacteria and

diatoms; and among their fur, moths, beetles, cockroaches and roundworms [5-7]. However, the greenish
color of the hair, which is most evident in three-toed
sloths, is due to green algae, which in most cases have
been identified as Trichophilus welckeri [6,8-10]. It is a
popular assumption that the association between the
three-toed sloth and the alga embedded in its hairs is a
symbiotic relationship with the alga obtaining shelter in
the cracks of the hair while providing green camouflage
for the sloth. It also has been proposed that the alga
offers no benefit to the sloth, but is able to survive in the
hair because the sloth does not prevent the alga growing
[3]. The hair of the three-toed sloth absorbs water like a
sponge, perhaps making it an even more ideal habitat for
algae, and prompting speculations that the sloth perhaps
receives nutrients from the alga via diffusion along the
spongy outer portion of the hairs, followed by absorption
into the skin [3]. The algae growing on sloth hair may
also produce exopolymeric substances that may give the
hair a desired texture or allow beneficial bacteria to grow.
Karsten et al. [11] found UV-absorbing mycosporine-like
amino acid (324 nm-MAA) from a green alga found in
sloth hair. Reduced exposure to UV-light could also be
seen as beneficial to the sloth over the long run. However, there is no clear evidence supporting any hypothesis
at present.
Here we collected 71 sloth hair samples from all six
extant sloth species as well as 12 environmental samples
from tree trunks to survey the diversity of eukaryotic
organisms present there. We found evidence for the
acquisition of green algae from the environment as well
as retention of green algae in the hair independent of
the sloths geographic location.

Results
Hair samples were examined from 71 sloth individuals,
which originated from French Guiana, Panama, Costa
Rica and Brazil (Fig. 1). Clone libraries were constructed
and 426 eukaryotic 18S rRNA gene sequences were
obtained from a total of 72 taxa (Table 1). The number
of eukaryotic taxa per sample varied between 12 and 22,
except in C. didactylus where the only two sequences
recovered turned out to represent the same taxon
(Table 1). The estimated total number of taxa (SChao1 at
the 97% similarity) varied between 21 and 38 being 146
for the total dataset. The Shannon diversity index with
95% confidence intervals was equal in the sloth species
containing a minimum of 12 taxa. The Shannon diversity index for the total dataset was 3.1. The coverage,
which estimates whether the clone library reflects the
actual diversity in the samples, was 89.3% for the complete dataset. In the comparison of different geographical areas the highest number of taxa was found on Isla
Escudo de Veraguas, Panama, where the number of taxa

Page 2 of 12

was 22 and the estimated number of taxa was 38
(Table 2). The Shannon diversity was lower in Costa
Rica (1.4 ± 0.3) and Paulo Seike Fragment (1.5 ± 0.4)
than in other areas (ranging from 1.7 ± 0.3 to 2.2 ± 0.5).
More than half of the taxa consisted of ciliates, apicomplexans and dinoflagellates (Fig. 2a). One third of the
sequences were green algae. Fungi also were present in
larger numbers and in addition a few 18S rRNA gene
sequences from arthropods, Euglenozoa and red algae,
were found. 10% of sequences could not be attributed to
a known eukaryote (Fig. 2a).
PCO analysis of all eukaryotic 18S rRNA gene
sequences from the sloth hair grouped most samples
together, excluding the Naos and Augusto Ruschi samples and the Barro Colorado Island Bradypus variegatus
-samples (Fig. 3a). The first two PCO axes explained
40.6% of the variability. However, the canonical analysis
of the three species of sloths that had been sampled
from several locations showed a separation of the different sloth species with squared canonical correlations of
δ21 = 0.778 and δ22 = 0.649 (Fig. 3b). The canonical test
statistic (t2) was significant (P = 0.007 with 9999 permutations). The CAP program determined the optimum
amount (m) of principal coordinates for the canonical
analysis to be 3, which achieved maximum proportion
of correct allocations (75%) and which explained 65.8%
of the variability. Correlations of taxa with both CAP
axes are shown graphically in Fig. 3c. We did not
include in the figure any taxa with correlations to both
axes <0.20 nor ones which occurred only once. The analysis showed that C. hoffmanni, B. torquatus and B. variegatus harbour different taxa in their hair (Fig. 3c). Due
to small amount of data from dry season we could not
test the separation of samples in relation to dry and wet
season. However, Naos Island C. hoffmanni and over
half of Barro Colorado B. variegatus sequences were collected on dry season and the position of those samples
in PCO indicates some degree of separation.
Fifty-two of the 71 sloth hair samples studied contained green algae, as observed either directly due to the
greenish color of the hair, or by using light microscopy,
which in some cases revealed algae even if the color of
the hair was dark but not green. Green algal sequences
were obtained successfully from 27 of the 71 samples.
We were not able to get a PCR product for the remaining 25 samples that contained visible green algae. Green
algal 18S rRNA gene sequences were obtained from five
extant sloth species. Despite all efforts no green algal
18S rRNA gene sequences were obtained from the two
hair samples of Choloepus didactylus. Green algae were
neither found in microscopic examinations of these two
samples. An average of 27% of the sloth samples for
which 18S rRNA gene clone libraries were constructed
contained green algae (Fig. 2a).

The majority of the green algal sequences obtained
from the hair samples formed a clade of their own
within the green algal class Ulvophyceae, distinct from
other publicly available taxa. This group received high
support (100%) for its monophyly in all phylogenetic
analyses that were employed (Fig. 4). Based on the morphological characters, small (3-13 μm) thick-walled cells
without pyrenoids (Fig. 5), the clade is likely to correspond to the green algal genus Trichophilus, which has
been described by Weber-van Bosse in 1887 [8,12].
Interestingly, there were no other green algal species
found in the same hair samples in which Trichophilus
was found. The clade was subdivided into three subclades that received moderate to high internal node support. Two clades, A and C in (Fig. 4) were formed by
rRNA gene clones originating from Choloepus hoffmannii hair samples. Clones in the clade B originated from
the hair of Bradypus. Within clade B, the sequences
from B. tridactylus were different from those of other
Bradypus species; there were four synapomorphic positions at the 5’-end of the 18S rRNA gene that distinguished the B. tridactylus hair alga from the
corresponding alga of other Bradypus species. The

bootstrap values for the clade B, originating from hair
samples of Bradypus, was high (99-100%) in MP, NJ,
GarliML analyses and 69% in ME analyses (Fig. 4).
Clades A and C, which originated from Choloepus, were
also supported by high bootstrap support (clade A: 7399%, clade B: 95-100%, Fig. 4). Separately from the
Ulvophycean green algal clade, green algae from sloth
hair grouped with several Trentepohlia-species, including Trentepohlia annulata, as well as with Prinzina
lagenifera, Myrmecia sp., Asterochloris sp. and Chlorella-like algae. The bootstrap supports for these clades
were up to 100%. These samples all came from Bradypus torquatus from Brazil and Choloepus hoffmanni
from Panama. One of the Brazilian samples, BT53, contained two taxa that clearly grouped separately in the
phylogenies (Printzina and Myrmecia; Fig. 4).
We obtained 78 sequences from the 12 environmental
samples from Barro Colorado Island. Half of the
sequences were green algal or from higher plants. Fungi
were also abundant and 10% of sequences were from
ciliates and other alveolites (Fig. 2b). All green algal
sequences from tree bark were attributable to the genus
Trentepohlia, a terrestrial green algal genus occurring

both in temperate regions as well as in tropics. They
formed several independent lineages within the Trentepohliales clade of the 18S rRNA gene phylogeny (Fig. 4).

Discussion
22We found evidence for three different patterns of
algae that occur in the hair of five sloth species: 1) The
green alga in the fur of the brown-throated sloth, Bradypus variegatus, and the pygmy three-toed sloth, B.
pygmaeus, is a unique species and no other green algal
species were found in their fur. Microscopy of the alga
on the hair revealed characteristic features to the
description of Trichophilus (Weber-van Bosse 1887),
which has indeed been described from the hair of Bradypus. 2) The maned three-toed sloth Bradypus torquatus was shown in our study to host a variety of
algae belonging to genera known to be terrestrial, e.g.
Trentepholia and Myrmecia. 3) The Hoffmann’s twotoed sloth Choloepus hoffmanni and the pale-throated
sloth Bradypus tridactylus, showed both patterns; they
hosted terrestrial green algae from their surroundings,
as well as the unique genus Trichophilus.
The green alga Trichophilus that was found in B. variegatus, B. pygmaeus and B. tridactylus was separated in
the phylogenetic trees from the Trichophilus occurring
in C. hoffmanni. The Bradypus-clade was supported by
high bootstrap values and as Bradypus variegatus and
Choloepus hoffmanni inhabit the same geographic area
and habitat [13], the separation of Trichophilus inhabiting Bradypus suggests co-evolution between Trichophilus and Bradypus species. This is further supported by
the cell sizes of Trichophilus in Bradypus and Trichophilus in Choloepus being different.

Trichophilus welckeri [8] has been described from
sloth hair and generally has been thought to be the only
green alga infesting sloth hair [6,9-11]. However, in former phylogenetic studies [10,11]T. welckeri (strain SAG
84.81) was shown to group with Prasiolopsis ramosa,
which is contrary to our study. We suspect earlier studies to be erroneous species identification, made
because of its habitat and the morphological investigation of the strain supports this. The strain SAG 84.81
resembles Prasiolopsis by forming irregular cushion-like
tufts of pseudoparanchymatous filaments and cells with
single, stellate, pyrenoid-containing chloroplast typical
of the Prasiolales [10] rather than numerous small, discoid chloroplasts without pyrenoids described for Trichophilus [12]. Therefore our understanding is that
Trichophilus welckeri has been found previously in nature [6,8,9,14] but has not yet been isolated into pure
culture and sequenced before. It is likely not to occur in
any other environment besides sloth hair given that tropical terrestrial green algal species like T. welckeri have
not been found before. Its restricted occurrence may be
explained by it being host-specific and possibly
thermophilic.
Among all 71 sloth individuals studied, 73% hosted
algae in their fur. It was either observed by the greenish
color of the fur or seen under the microscope in closer
observation. Seven of the 19 individuals in which we
found no evidence of algae were babies still at the age
of clinging to their mothers suggesting that at least Trichophilus is gained in childhood, most likely from the
mother. This observation is supported by an earlier
study noting that sloths gain the algae and other parasites by the time they are a few weeks old [5]. Besides

posterior probabilities > 0.95). The strain previously assumed to represent the sloths hair alga, Trichophilus welckeri, is marked in bold. Sequences
except those where accession numbers are given are reported for the first time in this study. Clones whose phylogenetic positions have been
inferred by adding their sequences to this ML phylogeny in ARB (see text) but which were not used to construct the phylogeny were simply
added to the figure (marked by “+”). Additional rRNA gene clones from sloth hair samples and tree bark that were positioned into clades A-C
and the Trentepohliales, respectively are listed in Additional file 4. Some branches were compressed into triangles for clarity of the graphic, the

Trichophilus, other green algae found in sloth hair were
terrestrial Trentepohlia, Prinzina, Myrmecia and Trebouxia -species as well as Chlorella-like algae. Among
these, only Trentepohlia has been reported previously
from sloth hair [6]. It is possible that sloths gain these
algae from the environment and host them in their fur.
However, they may also represent sloth-inhabiting specialists at a finer evolutionary level, e.g. species level,
than Trichophilus does. That there were 25 hair samples
containing visible green algae but for which we were

unable to get PCR-product, suggest that there were
either too few algae in the sample or there were PCR
inhibitors present in the DNA extracts. This problem
could be overcome by culturing the microbial community from fresh hair samples. The diversity of other
eukaryotic organisms in the hair was high, as expected,
based on previous studies, which have observed a wide
range of animals, e.g. moths, beetles, cockroaches, and
roundworms [5]. However, a surprising number and
diversity of ciliates and fungi were also found in the hair

Suutari et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:86
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/86

of all sloth species, excluding C. didactylus, for which
only two sequences were analyzed. All geographical areas
studied, except Costa Rica, had similar levels of eukaryote
diversity. The similar diversity is likely to be explained by
the similar habitat of sloths, regardless of the geographical area they inhabit. However, regardless of the similar
diversity, the species composition of eukaryotic organisms
varied as was seen in the PCO and CAP-analyses (Fig. 3).
The eukaryotes in B. variegatus, B. torquatus and C. hoffmanni were different (Fig. 3). Partly this separation can
be explained by the differing green algae inhabiting the
hair as was seen in the phylogenetic tree in which Trichophilus in Bradypus was separated from Trichophilus in
Choloepus (Fig. 4). Similarly, ciliates were different on the
three compared species. This can be due to differing hair
structure and possibly chemistry as well as differing ecology of the species. It may also reflect the divergence of
the two sloth genera about 20 million years ago [15],
which may have led to the separation of the cohabiting
eukaryotes as well.
The species composition of Naos Island C. hoffmanni
was clearly different from other Choloepus samples from
Panama. This may be due to the environment where the
sloths are living and the fact that samples were collected
on dry season. Naos Island is a small and dry island on
the Pacific coast of Panama, receiving on average 1800
mm rainfall per year [16]. Barro Colorado Island and
Isla Colón, are located closer to the Atlantic coast of
Panama, and therefore are moister, receiving rainfall of
2600-3300 mm per year [16].
The difference in the species composition in Barro
Colorado Island Choloepus and Bradypus was striking
(Fig. 3a) as the samples were collected from the same
area, although the majority of Bradypus sequences were
obtained from sloths on dry season. In contrary, Choloepus and Bradypus samples from Isla Colón were collected from the same area both on wet season being
close to each other in the PCO-analyses (Fig. 3a). This
suggests that the alteration of dry and wet season may
have an effect on the eukaryotic species composition in
the hair of sloths.
Despite the differing species compositions on sloth
hair, the results (Fig. 2a) show that besides primary producers (27% algae), there are also heterotrophic organisms (52% ciliates, apicomplexans and dinoflagellates) as
well as decomposers (8% fungi) in the fur, suggesting
that sloth fur supports a versatile small-scale ecosystem.
This was not seen in the environmental samples (Fig.
2b) in which 87% of the organisms are primary producers (algae or plants) or decomposers (fungi).

Conclusions
This is the first comparative survey of the algae and
other organisms found in the fur of all six extant species

Page 9 of 12

of sloths, and the first study to use molecular methods
to explore evolutionary relationships among the algae.
We confirm that a great variety of eukaryotes live in
sloth fur in addition to the various green algae. We also
show the presence of an alga, attributable to at least
three species of the genus Trichophilus, that has been
found only in sloth hair, and thus apparently is passed
directly from the mother to the offspring. That finding
adds strong support to the idea that the relationship
between sloths and at least one particular alga, Trichophilus spp., is a symbiotic one.

Methods
Sample collection and morphological studies

We examined 71 hair samples from 22 individuals of
Choloepus hoffmanni, 2 individuals of C. didactylus, 10
individuals of Bradypus tridactylus, 17 individuals of B.
variegatus, 12 individuals of B. pygmaeus and 8 individuals of B. torquatus. The sampled sloths came from
French Guiana, Panama, Costa Rica and Brazil. The
sampling was done in dry or wet season and details of
collection sites, sloth species and dates are presented in
the Additional file 1. A small tuft of sloth hair was
sampled from a greenish patch, if the animal was visibly
green or a darker patch if no greenish coloring was
observed. The hair was removed with scissors and preserved in a plastic vial containing silica gel. Samples
were stored in silica gel at ambient temperature until
further processing, which usually varied from one to
three months. All hair samples were studied with a light
microscope. If green algae were visibly present they
were photographed for further comparison and preserved samples were kept in silica gel for herbarium
material. In addition to the sloth hair samples we collected environmental samples from 12 locations on
Barro Colorado Island (Additional file 2). The samples
were scraped from the surface of tree trunks, or in one
case from the surface of a metal pole, from patches
which were visibly green. The greenish material was
scraped using a scalpel, stored in a plastic vial containing silica gel and stored as described above.
DNA extraction, PCR, Cloning and Sequencing

DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform [17] and
further purified using the High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit (Roche), according to the manufacturers’
instructions. A 1.5 kb fragment of the 18S rRNA was
amplified using the universal primers UNI7F and
UNI1534R [18]. However, in some hair samples we were
only able to get sequences from other eukaryotes but
not from green algae, even though they were clearly visible under the microscope. Therefore, additional primers
501F (5’ GGGTCTGGTTTTGAAATGAGG 3’) and
1700R (5’ CCGAAGTCTTCACCAGCACATC 3’) were

Suutari et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:86
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/86

used to amplify a 1.2 kb fragment of the 18S gene
from the green algae. Alternatively a combination of
universal and green algal specific primers was used to
amplify the green algae present in the samples. A combination of primers 107F (5’ CGAATGGCTCATTAAAT 3’) and UNI1534R were used to amplify the
green algae in the sample BT54_10, which was collected in Brazil.
The PCR amplification was done using Taq DNA
polymerase (ABgene) in 25 μl reactions. 0.6 μl Bovine
Serum Albumin (BSA, Fermentas, 1 mg/ml) was added
into the 25 μl PCR reaction to prevent potential inhibitors in the total DNA carried from hair samples to the
PCR reactions. The fragments were amplified in a PCR
cycle of initial denaturing of 3 minutes at 94°C, followed
by 30 cycles of 1 minute at 94°C, 1 minute at 50°C,
2 minutes at 72°C and a final extension of 5 minutes at
72°C. Products were run on 1% agarose gel and the fragments of desired length were cloned using pGEM®-T
Easy Vector System II -cloning kit (A1380, Promega)
according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Positive
colonies were picked with a toothpick, dipped into PCR
reaction mixture with Taq DNA polymerase (ABgene)
and PCR amplified using vector primers T7 (5’ TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG 3’) and SP6 (5’ ATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAA 3’).
The PCR products from the clone libraries were purified using Illustra GFX™ PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (GE Healthcare) or MultiScreen®PCR μ96
(Millipore). They were sequenced using primers SP6
and T7 or primers used for PCR amplification (UNI7F,
UNI1534R, 501F or 1700R) as well as with internal universal primers 384F (5’ ACCACATCCAAGGAWGGCA
3’) or 18S384F (5’ GGCKACCACAUCCAAGGAWGGCA 3’) designed for this study. The samples
were loaded on an automated sequencer 3730×l
(Applied Biosystems) or ABI3130XL Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems).
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses

The 18S rRNA gene sequences obtained in this work
were manually corrected using Chromas 2.31 (Technelysium, Pty Ltd.) sequence analysis software. Vector
sequence was removed and all sequences shorter than
650 bp were excluded from further analysis. The dataset
of 426 sequences (hair samples) and 78 sequences
(environmental samples) were analyzed using the
BLAST network service [19] against nr database at
NCBI and results were parsed for taxonomic
information.
In order to obtain a reliable alignment for further analyses, 43 sequences of sloth hair that began at the 3’ end
of the 18S gene were removed. For the remaining 383
sequences operational taxonomic units (taxa) were

Page 10 of 12

defined at 97% similarity (Additional file 3) from the
MAFFT vs. 6 [20] aligned (1.53 gap opening penalty,
0.123 gap extension penalty) and Phylip version 3.6 [21]
-Kimura 2-parameter corrected distance matrix using
the furthest neighbor command of the DOTUR program
[22]. Coverage [23] was calculated for the whole dataset
by the following equation: C = (1 - n/N)*100%, where C
is the coverage percentage, n is the number of taxa (97%
similarity) appearing only once, and N is the number of
all sequences in the library. The estimated number of
taxa (SChao1) and Shannon diversity index with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using DOTUR. Principal Coordinate Analysis followed by canonical analysis
on PCO axes and calculation of canonical test statistic
(t2) was performed with the program CAP [24,25] using
chi-square distance and visualized with SPSS 15. The
chi-square distance was chosen since it standardizes differences in scale and emphasizes changes in composition rather than changes in abundance. This was chosen
because the abundance of sequences was derived from
PCR amplification which is not a real abundance, but a
compositional view. The program determined the appropriate number of dimensions (m) included in the canonical analysis and identified the taxa that were
responsible for multivariate patterns. The number of
each 97% taxa was treated as one variable and a sloth
species collected from one locality was treated as a
sample.
The newly determined green algal 18S rRNA gene
sequences were compared to a broad selection of corresponding sequences from members of the Chlorophyta.
The closest matching full 18S rRNA gene sequence for
each algal clone, as found from BLAST [19] searches,
was also included. The selection of sequences was based
on a phylogenetic tree comprising an expanded sample
of more than 1500 rRNA gene sequences from the
green algae which is available in the 18S rRNA gene
sequence database maintained in the ARB program [26].
This database was updated with all currently available
18S rRNA gene sequences from the Chlorophyta. Newly
determined almost full sequences (>1600 bp long) as
well as partial sequences from clone libraries were
added to the database using the parsimony interactive
tool in ARB. The alignment was refined by comparing
the sequences with their next relatives from the ARB
database based on their pairing across a helix using secondary structure models as implemented in ARB. This
program generates a MP tree from all sequences and all
positions in the database as its reference tree, using a filter based on 50% base frequency across all species. A
subset of these sequences comprising a total of 63
representatives of the green algal classes Ulvophyceae,
Trebouxiophyceae and five prasinophytes (with prasinophyte sequence AF203402 as outgroup) was then

Suutari et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:86
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/86

downloaded from the ARB database for further analyses using the 50% base frequency filter. The final
alignment of 68 taxa (23 algal sequences from sloth
hair, 2 from tree bark) was 1690 nucleotides in length.
Of the aligned sites, 419 were parsimony informative
and an additional 185 were variable but not informative. An optimized maximum likelihood tree (see
below) was then uploaded into ARB. To infer the phylogenetic positions of additional rDNA clones (almost
full and partial sequences) which were not used for
phylogeny construction were added to this tree using
the parsimony interactive tool.
Maximum likelihood phylogenies were calculated
using PAUP* version 4.0b10 [27] and GARLI v0.96
http://www.nescent.org/wg_garli[28] (Additional file 4
and Additional file 5). ModelTest 3.7 [29] used in conjunction with PAUP 4b10 determined that the TrN+I+G
model [30] provided the best fit to the data according
the AIC criterion with estimations of nucleotide frequencies (A = 0.254, C = 0.217, G = 0.281, T = 0.248), a
rate matrix with six different substitution types, assuming a heterogeneous rate of substitutions with a gamma
distribution of variable sites (number of rate categories
= 4, shape parameter = 0.60) and a proportion of invariable sites (pinvar) of 0.46. The ML tree obtained in
PAUP was used as input for three additional rounds of
ML analyses to search for trees with smaller -ln likelihoods, but trees with better likelihood scores were not
obtained. Bootstrap resampling was performed on the
ML tree obtained in GARLI with 1000 replications.
Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed with
MrBayes version 3.1.2 [31,32] using the GTR+I+G
model (rate matrix with six different substitution types,
number of rate categories = 4, and with the nucleotide
frequencies, shape parameter a, and pinvar estimated
from the data), four Markov chains and 2,000,000 generations sampling every 100 generations with the first
25% of the sampled trees discarded, leaving 15,000 trees.
Posterior probabilities were then calculated from two
independent runs using the 50% majority rule consensus
of the kept trees. Minimum Evolution [33], neighborjoining [34] distance and Maximum Parsimony (MP)
approaches were done in PAUP 4b10. ME distance trees
were constructed with DNA distances set to maximum
likelihood and a heuristic search procedure with 10 random input orders and TBR were employed to find the
best tree. Best scoring trees were held at each step. NJ
phylogenies were constructed in connection with the
“HKY85 model” [35]. In MP analyses, the sites were
weighted (RI over an interval of 1-1000). The heuristic
search for the best tree was the same as in ME analyses.
Bootstrap resampling was performed on NJ trees with
2000, for ME and MP with 1000 replications.
