Abstract
Background: Most vascular flowering plants have the capacity to form symbiotic associations with arbuscular
mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. The symbiosis develops in the roots where AM fungi colonize the root cortex and form
arbuscules within the cortical cells. Arbuscules are enveloped in a novel plant membrane and their establishment
requires the coordinated cellular activities of both symbiotic partners. The arbuscule-cortical cell interface is the
primary functional interface of the symbiosis and is of central importance in nutrient exchange. To determine the
molecular events the underlie arbuscule development and function, it is first necessary to identify genes that may
play a role in this process. Toward this goal we used the Affymetrix GeneChip® Medicago Genome Array to
document the M. truncatula transcript profiles associated with AM symbiosis, and then developed laser
microdissection (LM) of M. truncatula root cortical cells to enable analyses of gene expression in individual cell
types by RT-PCR.
Results: This approach led to the identification of novel M. truncatula and G. intraradices genes expressed in
colonized cortical cells and in arbuscules. Within the arbuscule, expression of genes associated with the urea
cycle, amino acid biosynthesis and cellular autophagy was detected. Analysis of gene expression in the colonized
cortical cell revealed up-regulation of a lysine motif (LysM)-receptor like kinase, members of the GRAS
transcription factor family and a symbiosis-specific ammonium transporter that is a likely candidate for mediating
ammonium transport in the AM symbiosis.
Conclusion: Transcript profiling using the Affymetrix GeneChip® Medicago Genome Array provided new
insights into gene expression in M. truncatula roots during AM symbiosis and revealed the existence of several G.
intraradices genes on the M. truncatula GeneChip®. A laser microdissection protocol that incorporates low-melting
temperature Steedman's wax, was developed to enable laser microdissection of M. truncatula root cortical cells.
LM coupled with RT-PCR provided spatial gene expression information for both symbionts and expanded current
information available for gene expression in cortical cells containing arbuscules.

Background
The arbuscular mycorrhiza is the name given to a symbiotic association of plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal
(AM) fungi. The AM symbiosis occurs widely throughout
the plant kingdom and involves angiosperms, gymnosperms, pteridophytes and some bryophytes. The fungi
that participate in this symbiosis are all members of the
Glomeromycota, [1-3], a likely sister group to the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. The symbiosis develops in the
plant roots, where AM fungi form extensively branched
hyphae, called arbuscules, in the cortical cells. In addition
to growth within the root, the fungus develops a network
of extra-radical hyphae that extends into the rhizosphere.
Inorganic phosphate (Pi) and nitrogen (N), acquired by
the extra-radical hyphae, are translocated to the arbuscules and released to the plant. In return the plant provides the fungus with carbon. P and N are the two mineral
nutrients that plants require in the greatest quantities and
therefore the symbiosis has an important influence on
plant health and consequently on ecosystem function [46].
There has been significant progress in understanding the
signaling associated with the early stages of development
of AM symbiosis [7]. Some of the signal molecules have
been identified, including strigolactones, which act as precontact signals to stimulate AM fungal growth and metabolism [8,9]. In addition, several components of a plant
'symbiosis signaling' pathway required for fungal entry
into the root have been cloned [10-17]. These genes were
identified initially in legumes, where the symbiosis signaling pathway is required also for the interaction with
rhizobia. However, orthologs of these genes have been
identified in tomato and rice, where they are required for
AM symbiosis [18,19]. This further supports the hypothesis that the symbiosis signaling pathway arose initially for
interactions with AM fungi, and in legumes it was coopted to enable interactions with rhizobia [19-21]. Currently, for AM symbiosis, the downstream genes controlled by this pathway are not known. In general, events
associated with fungal development in the cortex are less
well understood, and genes controlling arbuscule formation, have yet to be identified. Arbuscule development is
an active process for both symbionts. The fungal hypha
penetrates the cortical cell wall and undergoes repeated
dichotomous branching, while the plant cell undergoes
significant cellular changes, including reorganization of
the cytoskeleton, endoplasmic reticulum and development of the peri-arbuscular membrane, which envelops
the arbuscule [22-26]. Reorganization of the cytoskeleton
and endoplasmic reticulum is initiated prior to arbuscule
formation suggesting that a mobile signal may trigger
these events [26,27]. Currently, information about the
lipid and protein content of the peri-arbuscular membrane is limited, but it is clear that the membrane contains

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/10

some unique proteins, including symbiosis-specific Pi
transporters that function to import Pi into the cortical
cell [28]. The transporters involved in N acquisition are as
yet unknown, but a series of nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy and gene expression studies indicate
that the fungus assimilates N in the external hyphae,
translocates this to the intra-radical hyphae as arginine,
and then disassembles the arginine to retain the carbon
molecules, while providing N to the plant, probably as
ammonium (NH4+) [29-31]. Although not shown
directly, it is likely that NH4+ transfer to the plant occurs at
the arbuscule-cortical cell interface also.
Arbuscules are terminally differentiated hyphae with a
finite life and following development, they undergo a
degeneration phase in which the arbuscule branches collapse, and the arbuscule gradually disappears from the cell
[22,32-34]. This process is not well understood, but it is
clear that arbuscule development and degeneration occur
cell autonomously and arbuscules in neighboring cells
may be in different phases of the life cycle. Although the
arbuscule-cortical cell interface is central to the AM symbiosis, currently, we understand little of the processes that
enable its development or that control its degeneration.
To gain insight into the molecular changes that accompany development of AM symbiosis, a variety of transcript
profiling approaches have been undertaken. In rice, surveys using a whole genome chip identified mycorrhizaresponsive genes and revealed a partial overlap in the transcriptional responses to mutualistic and pathogenic biotrophic fungi [35]. In Medicago truncatula, suppressive
subtractive hybridization, cDNA arrays and long oligonucleotide arrays have been used to document transcript
changes associated with AM symbiosis [36-40]. The inclusion of M. truncatula symbiosis mutants enabled gene
expression to be associated with different phases of the
symbiosis, for example appressoria formation [41]. A
mycorrhizal root includes a heterogeneous mix of colonized and non-colonized cells, and therefore spatial gene
expression information is particularly important. In situ
hybridization and/or analysis of promoter-reporter
fusions demonstrated that genes whose expression was
induced in colonized roots could be further separated into
two groups; those expressed exclusively in cells containing
arbuscules and those expressed in cells containing arbuscules and in neighboring non-colonized cells
[28,36,38,42-46]. These data indicate that the different
cortical cells of the mycorrhizal root system have unique
transcript profiles, and point to at least two signaling
pathways active in regulating mycorrhiza-induced gene
expression. While these approaches have advanced information about gene expression in colonized cortical cells,
in situ hybridization or promoter-reporter gene studies are
labor intensive and this precludes surveys of a large

number of genes. Our current knowledge of genes
expressed in cells containing arbuscules is limited to less
than 35 genes. In addition, the genes that have been analyzed are those that have the highest transcript levels and
relatively few receptors or transcriptional regulators have
been investigated. Beyond plant gene expression in the
colonized cortical cell, almost nothing is known about
gene expression in the arbuscule.
Laser microdissection (LM) offers a new way to obtain
RNA from a subset of cells, and coupled with transcript
profiling approaches, it provides an opportunity to monitor gene expression in an individual cell type more easily
than promoter-reporter gene fusions. LM was originally
developed to isolate specific animal cells from complex
tissues; a breakthrough for cancer and neuronal research
[47,48]. In plants, LM was used initially to isolate phloem
cells from rice leaves [49]. Subsequently, epidermal and
vascular tissues were isolated from maize coleoptiles [50]
and then various cell or tissue types, including bundle
sheath, shoot tip protoderm, shoot apical meristem, leaf
primordium, seedling procambium, hypocotyls and root
meristems have been harvested from maize, rice, radish
and tomato [51,52]. So far, most studies have focused on
shoot tissues. In a few cases, LM has been used to isolate
plant cells during interactions with other organisms
including cyst or root-knot nematode feeding sites in soybean roots [53-57]. In addition, fungus-plant interactions
were assessed in maize by dissecting parenchyma cells
infected with Colletotrichum graminicola and the RNA samples were used for analysis of C. graminicola gene expression [58]. Recently, this technology was used to isolate
cells from arbuscular mycorrhizal or non-mycorrhizal
tomato roots [59] where it enabled the analysis of phosphate transporter gene expression in the plant and the
fungus.
Toward the ultimate goal of understanding how arbuscules develop, we initiated experiments to identify genes
expressed in cortical cells containing arbuscules. We first
undertook a profiling experiment with a new M. truncatula GeneChip®, and then developed LM of M. truncatula
root cortical cells to enable cell-type specific analyses of
gene expression by RT-PCR. This approach led to the identification of novel plant and fungal genes expressed in colonized cortical cells and in arbuscules, including
members of the LysM-receptor like kinase family, GRAS
transcription factor family, a novel ammonium transporter that is a strong candidate for mediating symbiotic
ammonium transport, and AM fungal genes of the urea
cycle.

Results
Use of the Medicago GeneChip® to monitor transcript
profiles in M. truncatula colonized by Glomus
intraradices
Previously in M. truncatula, a long oligonucleotide-based
array containing 16,000 features, was used to profile gene
expression in a number of different AM symbioses
[38,39]. While these studies provided important insights
into gene expression during the AM symbiosis, they surveyed only a small fraction of the M. truncatula transcriptome. In order to expand these gene expression studies,
we used the Affymetrix Medicago GeneChip®. It contains
61,278 probe sets of which 32,167 were designed based
on sequences from the M. truncatula EST database and
18,733 were based on gene predictions from the International Medicago Genome Annotation Group (IMGAG)
http://www.affymetrix.com. The GeneChip® was hybridized with three biological replicate RNA samples from M.
truncatula and M. truncatula/G. intraradices mycorrhizal
roots and using significance criteria established previously
[60], 652 genes that showed a 2-fold or greater change in
gene expression in mycorrhizal roots relative to the mockinoculated controls were identified. Of these, 637 genes
showed increased transcript levels in G. intraradices-colonized roots, and 15 genes showed decreased transcript levels (Additional file 1). Our previous experiments with the
M. truncatula 16K array had identified 110 genes that
showed a 2-fold or greater change in gene expression [39].
82 induced genes were present in both data sets [39].
Thus, the GeneChip dataset has extended the transcriptional information available for M. truncatula/G. intraradices mycorrhizal roots substantially.

New AM-induced genes with potentially important roles
in the symbiosis include an ammonium transporter
(IMGAG|1723.m00046), which shows a 4.8 fold induction in mycorrhizal roots (Table 1). This transporter is a
candidate for mediating symbiotic N transport. Other
transporters including a zinc transporter (AJ499751, 7.6
fold), organic-cation transporter (TC98622, 2.5 fold), and
copper transport protein (TC97522, 50 fold) were
induced in mycorrhizal roots, along with genes encoding
transporters of the peptide transporter family (AL377202,
TC97569, AL387494, and BE998753) and ABC transporter family (AL382570, IMGAG|1050.m00013,
IMGAG|733.m00003,
IMGAG|1088.m00025,
AW287942,
BG644663,
TC109985,
TC96634,
IMGAG|795.m00013).
Carbon metabolism and carbon transport in the AM symbiosis are also areas of great importance that are currently
poorly understood. A putative alpha-amylase gene
(IMGAG|1739.m00052) was up-regulated 2.2 fold suggesting a potential increase in starch breakdown. Also, a
putative SNF1-related protein kinase gene (AW573798)

was up-regulated 7.7 fold (Table 1). The SNF1 and SNF1related kinases are widely conserved in eukaryotes and
play a central role in sugar and energy signaling [61].
Two genes, one predicted to encode a protein involved in
lipid biosynthesis, palmitoyl-ACP thioesterase, and one
encoding an enzyme of lipid breakdown, a triacylglycerol/
steryl ester lipase (TC110731) were highly up-regulated.
The latter showed a 102-fold increase in transcript levels
(Table 1). This increase in both biosynthetic and degradative activities may be associated with the ongoing development and breakdown of the peri-arbuscular membrane
associated with the different phases of the arbuscule
lifespan.

Currently, transcription factors that regulate AM-induced
gene expression are unknown. Here, 5 probesets representing members of the GRAS family of transcription factors
(AL386879,
AL386880,
TC105118,
IMGAG|1755.m00026 and AJ499899) indicate that several members of this gene family are up-regulated more
than 7-fold. Two GRAS family transcription factors are
essential for nodulation [62,63], and given the conserved
symbiosis signaling pathway, there is a strong possibility
that members of this family will be involved in regulating
gene expression in AM symbiosis also. Other genes related
to signaling or perception of signal, include a putative
inositol
polyphosphate
phosphatase
(IMGAG|906.m00010) that was up-regulated 4.4-fold

(Table 1). Inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases are
involved in the modulation of phosphoinositide signaling. In plants, inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases are
members of large gene families and their individual roles
are mostly unknown. While this signaling pathway has
not been implicated in the AM symbiosis, lysophosphatidyl choline, was recently shown to induce expression of
symbiotic Pi transporters in potato and tomato [64].
Finally, one of the most intriguing findings was a gene
encoding a lysine motif-receptor-like kinase (LysM-RLK)
called MtLYR1 [65] which showed a 3.6-fold increase in
mycorrhizal roots (Table 1). MtLYR1 is a close relative of
NFP, a LysM-RLK gene that is likely a Nod factor receptor
[65,66].
Glomus intraradices genes are represented on the
Medicago GeneChip®
The Medicago GeneChip® includes 32,167 probes
designed to sequences from the M. truncatula Gene Index
http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu. The Gene Index
includes ESTs from mycorrhizal root cDNA libraries, consequently, there is the potential that some probes were
designed, unintentionally, to ESTs that represent genes
from the AM fungal symbionts. The discovery that some
probes represent genes with BLAST hits exclusively to fungal sequences suggested that this may be the case. Therefore, we systematically mined the array data to identify
probes that might represent AM fungal genes. Probes that
showed an average expression value on the mock-inoculated arrays near background levels (≤ 63) and a higher
average expression value on G. intraradices-inoculated
arrays, and corresponded to ESTs present exclusively in
mycorrhizal cDNA libraries, were considered strong candidates. Subsequent TBLASTX analysis indicated that 49
probesets with the criteria outlined above represented
genes that showed best BLAST hits to fungal sequences
(Additional file 2). There were additional probes designed
to ESTs that showed similarity to fungal sequences but the
ESTs were short and the BLAST scores were unreliable, so
they were excluded from further analysis. Of the 49 genes
identified as putative fungal genes, 22 are represented by
a single EST, and all are present exclusively in M. truncatula/G. intraradices mycorrhizal root cDNA libraries and are
therefore likely to represent G. intraradices genes. Experimental analysis of ten genes confirmed that they are G.
intraradices genes. They could be amplified by PCR from
G. intraradices genomic DNA and not from M. truncatula
genomic DNA (Table 1; Figure 1). Except for the putative
G. intraradices a-tubulin a1 gene, which is highly conserved, the primers designed to the G. intraradices genes
did not amplify transcripts from G. versiforme. It has been
shown that despite a common genus name, these two
fungi are only distantly related [67]. Eight of these genes
(TC100037,
TC103687,
TC104499,
TC105031,
TC109807, TC111242, TC112506 and TC105246) were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/10

represented on the 16K array although their origin was
not demonstrated [39].
Previous estimates suggest that total RNA extracted from a
highly colonized, whole root system contains not more
than 12% AM fungal RNA [68]. Consequently, it might be
predicted that the fungal transcripts represented in the EST
libraries and consequently represented on the GeneChip,
are likely to represent the most highly expressed fungal
genes. Interestingly, the fungal genes represented on the
array include genes predicted to encode enzymes of N
metabolism, specifically, the urea cycle (Additional file 2).
Development of a laser microdissection procedure suitable
for the capture of cortical cells from M. truncatula
mycorrhizal roots
To enable LM of cortical cells containing arbuscules, the
first issue was to identify suitable regions of the root system to fix and embed. In an AM symbiosis, the fungus
proliferates in the inner cortex of the root and in M. truncatula mycorrhizal roots, the colonized regions are not
readily visible without fixing and staining. In particular, it
is difficult to identify regions of the root with infections
that contain large numbers of arbuscules. To facilitate
this, our goal was to first develop a M. truncatula transgenic plant line in which the colonized regions of the root
would be marked by expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP). Previously, we had identified MtSCP1, a gene
that is expressed only in mycorrhizal roots, specifically in
colonized regions of the roots [36]. Analysis of an MtSCP1
promoter-GFP fusion construct in M. truncatula transgenic
roots indicated that the construct reported the presence of
the AM fungus in the cortex [36]. The MtSCP1 promoterGFP fusion construct was transferred to Agrobacterium
tumefaciens and M. truncatula transgenic plants were generated. The transgenic plants showed the same expression
patterns as seen previously and strong GFP fluorescence
reported the presence of the fungus in the cortex (Additional file 3). Using the transgenic plants, we were able to
identify and dissect out highly colonized regions of the
root. These were then used for LM experiments. In addition, RNA extracted from these intact colonized root
pieces is highly enriched for plant and fungal transcripts
associated with colonized regions of the root, and are useful RNA resource.

A review of LM and its use in plants, revealed that a wide
variety of protocols have been used for the preparation of
plant tissue for LM [52]. Each different plant tissue has
unique characteristics and therefore it is necessary to
determine empirically, the most appropriate fixation and
embedding regime to retain satisfactory cellular morphology, while still enabling extraction of high RNA quality.
We based our approach on a protocol developed by Kerk
et al. [51] and then evaluated aspects of fixation, embed-

ding, RNA extraction and amplification to find conditions
optimal for M. truncatula mycorrhizal roots. RNA quality
was evaluated using a bioanalyzer and/or agarose gel electrophoresis. Tissues were fixed in Farmer's fixative and fixation times of 12 or 24 h yielded RNA with an RNA
integrity number (RIN) of 8.5 (intact RNA, RIN = 10) as
assessed by a bioanalyzer. In addition, fixation at 12 and

24 hours yielded larger size amplified, antisense RNA
(aRNA) molecules, than a 4 h fixation (data not shown).
We experienced considerable difficulties with RNA degradation during the paraffin embedding and xylene de-waxing stages, so as an alternative to paraffin wax, we tested
Steedman's wax, a polyester wax used for immunolocalization [69-71]. Steedman's wax has the advantages that it

can be mixed under RNase-free conditions, has a lower
melting temperature (38–40°C), and sections can be dewaxed easily with ethanol. The RNA quality extracted
from root samples embedded in Steedman's was good
(RIN = 6.7) and the morphology of the sections were comparable to sections made from tissues embedded in paraffin wax (Figure 2).
LM and laser pressure catapulting was carried out with the
P.A.L.M. microbeam system. Between 400 and 600 cortical cells were harvested directly into lysis buffer and RNA
was isolated within 12 hours of harvest. Two rounds of
linear RNA amplification yielded over 23 μg of aRNA
(Additional file 4). To validate the LM RNA, we examined
the expression of MtPT4, a gene expressed exclusively in
cells containing arbuscules. In addition, we assessed
expression of MtSCP1, and MtBCP1, two genes expressed
in this cell type that are suitable as additional markers.
The latter two genes are not unique to colonized cortical
cells [28,36,38]. MtPT4, MtSCP1, and MtBCP1 transcripts
were detected in two biological replicate samples of RNA
from cells with arbuscules and not from cortical cells captured from mock-inoculated roots. Elongation factor 1alpha (EF1α) transcripts were present in RNA samples
from both cell types (Figure 3). The length of individual
molecules present in the aRNA sample was evaluated by
examining MtPT4 transcripts [28]. cDNA was synthesized
using random priming and the length of molecules in the
samples was evaluated by RT-PCR using primers distributed across the MtPT4 gene. Although we were unable to
amplify the intact 1.8 kb MtPT4 transcript, primers sets
that amplified less than 210 bp fragments at the 5' end,
middle, or 3' end of the coding sequence showed that the
aRNA represents complete transcripts but not necessarily
as single intact molecules (Additional file 5).
M. truncatula gene expression in cortical cells containing
G. versiforme and G. intraradices arbuscules
Following development and validation of the LM
method, we generated cell-type specific RNA samples
from cortical cells of M. truncatula mock-inoculated roots,
and cortical cells containing either G. versiforme or G.
intraradices arbuscules. In addition, we prepared RNA
from the highly-colonized 'mycorrhiza-enriched' root
pieces from G. versiforme-colonized roots. Genes selected
for expression analysis in these samples included 6 genes
that were previously reported as mycorrhiza-induced, but
whose spatial expression patterns were not known, and 12
novel genes that showed increased transcript levels in the
GeneChip® experiment (Table 1). Initially, transcript levels were monitored in the RNA from the intact, enriched
root piece samples. All 12 new genes showed an increase
in transcript levels in the RNA from enriched mycorrhizal
root samples relative to that of the mock-inoculated controls confirming the expression patterns observed on the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/10

array (Figure 4). This was observed for both M. truncatula
roots colonized with G. versiforme and G. intraradices.
Transcripts for 9 of these genes were extremely low or not
detectable in mock-inoculated roots. In the RNA samples
from laser microdissected cells, 13 of 18 genes assayed
showed expression in cortical cells containing arbuscules
and not in the cortical cells from mock-inoculated control
roots (Figure 5). For 6 genes, transcripts were detected in
only one of the G. versiforme arbuscule-cortical cell samples indicating some variability in the samples. However,
analysis in G. intraradices arbuscule-cortical cell samples
confirmed the expression in this cell-type (Figure 5). It is
possible that sample variability arises from variation in
the developmental stages of the arbuscules in the sample.
This could lead to differences in the samples and would
likely have the greatest effects on low abundance transcripts or on genes whose expression is associated with a
specific phase of arbuscule development. Using this
approach, transcripts of two putative transcription factors
of the GRAS family, a peptide transporter, an ammonium
transporter, three genes associated with lipid biosynthesis
or degradation and a LysM-receptor like kinase were
detected in cortical cells containing arbuscules and were
not detected in cortical cells from the mock-inoculated
controls. Four mycorrhiza-induced genes, the putative
copper transport protein, dihydrodipicolinate synthase,
inositol polyphosphate phosphatase and an SNF1-like
kinase were not detected in cortical cells containing arbuscules. As transcripts of the latter 4 genes were detected in
the colonized root pieces (Figure 4), it can be concluded
that they are expressed in mycorrhizal roots but in a cell
type other than the cortical cells containing arbuscules.
Analysis of G. intraradices gene expression in arbuscules
The expression of 10 G. intraradices genes identified on the
arrays was evaluated in RNA from both the colonized root
pieces and the LM cell-type specific samples (Table 1; Figure 6). The genes selected for analysis included those predicted to encode enzymes of N metabolism, in particular
the urea cycle including a putative arginase gene. Consistent with the GeneChip results, transcripts for all 10 genes
were present in M. truncatula/G. intraradices mycorrhizal
roots samples. In addition, all genes tested showed expression in arbuscules. This suggests that the urea cycle is
likely to be active in this tissue. Previous NMR studies had
predicted this but a direct demonstration of the presence
of transcripts in arbuscules had not been made. In addition to genes associated with N and amino acid metabolism, we also detected a putative G. intraradices AUT7
homolog and a putative phospholipids-transporting
ATPase in arbuscules. AUT7 is part of the autophagic
machinery and is considered a marker of cells undergoing
an autophagic response. The presence of this transcript in
arbuscules is the first molecular hint that arbuscule turnover might involve autophagy. The phospholipid-trans-

porting ATPases are P-type ATPases whose activity is
required to maintain phospholipid asymmetry in the
membrane bilayers [72]. In Magnaporthe grisea, the activity
of a phospholipid-transporting ATPase was required for
development of the penetration hypha and further growth
of the fungus within the plant cells [73].

Discussion
Here, we used the Medicago GeneChip® to extend the transcript dataset for mycorrhizal roots and coupled this with
LM and RT-PCR to assess gene expression specifically at
the cortical cell-arbuscule interface. At the time that this
work was initiated, there were only a few reports of LM of
root cells or roots associated with other organisms, consequently, it was necessary to test and modify existing protocols to develop a protocol suitable for M. truncatula
mycorrhizal roots. The protocol developed was based
largely on Kerk et al. [51] and the main modification was
the nature of the embedding material. Following initial
difficulties with the quality of the RNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues, we tested Steedman's wax with
the idea that RNA degradation would be minimized by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/10

exposing roots to lower temperatures during embedding,
and the use of ethanol for de-waxing would be less detrimental than xylene. This proved to be the case and this
low-melting-temperature, ethanol-soluble wax enabled us
to extract RNA from M. truncatula roots of superior quality. LM of approximately 400 M. truncatula root cortical
cells, followed by two rounds of linear RNA amplification
provided microgram quantities of RNA for RT-PCR analyses. These cell-type specific RNA samples were validated
by monitoring the expression of three genes, MtPT4,
MtSCP1 and MtBCP1, whose expression patterns have
been described previously [28,36,38]. Recently, Balestrini
et al. [59] reported the use of methacarn fixation and paraffin embedding for LM of cells from tomato roots colonized by the AM fungus G. mosseae. However, they did not
couple this with linear RNA amplification and consequently, it was necessary to harvest a large quantity of
cells, between 3,000 and 11,000 cells to obtain nanogram
quantities of RNA. Although the linear RNA amplification
used in our approach may lead to a 3' end bias in the transcript molecules, comparative analyses are possible with
careful primer design.
The GeneChip analysis provided a greatly expanded view
of genes induced in the AM symbiosis, including several
transcription factors and receptors. As reported previously, development of the AM symbiosis is accompanied
by significant alterations in gene expression including the
expression of novel 'mycorrhiza-specific' genes. Surprisingly, transcription factors responsible for mycorrhizaregulated gene expression are entirely unknown. Here we
identified 5 members of the GRAS transcription factor
family induced in mycorrhizal roots (AL386879,
AL386880, TC105118, IMGAG|1755.m00026, and
AJ499899). The GRAS family of proteins is unique to
plants and its name derives from three members that were
initially identified GAI, RGA, and SCR [74-76]. The Arabidopsis GRAS family contains at least 33 members including Scarecrow and Short Root, two proteins that play a
central role in root development (reviewed by [77]. Two
M. truncatula GRAS proteins, MtNSP1 and MtNSP2, are
essential for the activation of Nod-factor-induced genes in
the rhizobial symbiosis [62,63]. Given their roles in root
development and symbiosis, members of this family are
likely candidates for regulating gene expression in mycorrhizal roots. Here, we confirmed by RT-PCR that two putative GRAS genes; AJ499899 and AL386880, were
expressed in G. versiforme- or G. intraradices-colonized
roots, with non-detectable or low levels of transcripts in
mock-inoculated roots. Furthermore, AJ499899 and
AL386880 transcripts were not detected in cortical cells
from mock-inoculated roots but were detected in arbuscule-containing cortical cells. Consequently, it is possible
that these GRAS factors regulate gene expression in colonized cortical cells. The current data do not preclude a role

in other cell types and one GRAS factor, represented by
EST AL386880 is also highly expressed in root nodules. It
would be interesting to know whether expression is associated with cells containing symbiosomes [60].
In addition to transcription factors, receptor proteins
operating in signaling pathways, involved in arbuscule
development are also entirely unknown. In contrast,

receptors involved in signaling during nodule development have been described. Genes predicted to encode
LysM-RLK including NFR1 and NFR5 in Lotus japonicus
[78,79] and orthologs LYK3 and NFP in M. truncatula
[80], and SYM10 in pea [78] are involved in Nod factor
signaling and are likely to be Nod factor receptors. The M.
truncatula LysM-RLK family contains at least 17 genes,
which, based on their kinase domain phylogeny, are

M. truncatula/G. intraradices (LM-Gi3) mycorrhizal root systems was used. Cortical cells were obtained by laser microdissection
(LM). Transcripts that were induced in only one of the M. truncatula/G. versiforme LM samples were further evaluated in M. truncatula/G. intraradices LM samples. The larger size fragment in LM-Gi3 (TC97569) may indicate presence of another peptide

divided into three subfamilies. Subfamily II contains NFP
and four other members of the family of which MtLYR1 is
most similar in sequence to NFP. There are no ESTs for
MtLYR1 and in previous studies, transcripts were detected
in nodulated roots but not in nodules [65]. Here, we
found that MtLYR1 (IMGAG|1197.m00015) transcripts
increased in G. versiforme or G. intraradices-colonized
roots. Moreover, the MtLYR1 gene was detected in cortical
cells with arbuscules. Like NFP, MtLYR1 has three LysM
domains and a Ser-Thr kinase domain that lacks the activation and P-loops and consequently, it probably lacks
kinase activity [65]. It is possible that these 'inactive'
kinases dimerize with an active receptor kinase to form a
receptor with kinase activity and consistent with this, heterodimerization of NFR1 and NFR5 has been demonstrated. LysM domains recognize N-acetyl glucosamine or
structurally similar molecules such as Nod factors [81-83].
It is possible that the LysM domain of MtLYR1 recognizes

the N-acetyl glucosamine residues in chitin in the AM fungal cell walls and given its expression pattern, it could play
a role in signaling during arbuscule development.
Cell biological analyses of the arbuscule-cortical cell interface suggest that the peri-arbuscular membrane increases
the membrane area within the cortical cell at least 10-fold.
Consistent with this, metabolite profiles of mycorrhizal
roots indicate a significant increase in fatty acids [84]. The
GeneChip analyses identified two new mycorrhizainduced genes predicted to be involved in fatty acid
metabolism; a putative palmitoyl-ACP thioesterase gene
(TC99271) and a triacylglycerol/steryl ester lipase-like
protein gene (TC110731) that show a 49- and 102-fold
increase in transcript levels respectively. RT-PCR analysis
indicated that TC99271 and TC110731 transcript levels
increase in cortical cells with arbuscules. Fatty acid synthesis in plants is a cyclic process and the extension cycles

involves the binding of acyl chains to a soluble acyl carrier
protein (ACP), and specific thioesterases hydrolyze the
newly formed acyl-ACP into fatty acids and ACP [85]. An
increase in palmitoyl-ACP thioesterase gene expression
suggests an increase in the biosynthesis of palmitic acid.
Consistent with this, a recent metabolite profile of G.
intraradices/M. truncatula roots showed that mycorrhizal
roots contained high levels of palmitic and oleic acids
during active phases of AM symbiosis [84]. Oleic acid
(18:1Δ9) is created by a desaturation reaction catalyzed by
a delta-9 desaturase. Surprisingly, a G. intraradices delta-9
desaturase gene was expressed highly in mycorrhizal roots
and specifically in cells with arbuscules. Previous studies
had speculated that the fungus might obtain palmitic acid
from the plant, and even suggested that AM fungi might
lack fatty acid synthase activity and thus be dependent on
host lipid [86]. In the absence of a full genome sequence,
it is not possible to determine whether this is correct,
however, our findings of complementary gene expression
patterns in the two symbionts is intriguing.
Other metabolic changes documented in mycorrhizal
roots include an increase in amino acids [84]. In plants,
there are at least three protein families involved in transport of small peptides, the ABC transporters, the di/tripeptide transporters (PTR family) and the oligopeptide (OPT)
family. Two genes (AL387494 and TC97569) of the PTR
family were expressed in mycorrhizal roots and TC97569
was detected in cells containing arbuscules. The GeneChip
experiment also led to the identification of other new
genes predicted to encode transport proteins including a
copper transport protein (TC97522) and an ammonium
transporter (IMGAG|1723.m00046) and the latter was
expressed in cells with arbuscules. The identification of a
mycorrhiza-induced ammonium transporter is particularly interesting. It is clear from many studies that in addition to Pi, N is also transferred from the fungus to the
plant and recent analyses indicate that N is likely transferred to the plant as ammonium. This ammonium transporter is a strong candidate for a role in the acquisition of
ammonium delivered via the fungus. Metabolic labeling
studies and gene expression analyses led to a model in
which inorganic N taken up by the fungal extra-radical
mycelium is converted into arginine which is transported
into the intra-radical mycelium, where it is broken down
into amino acids. Ammonium, resulting from arginine
breakdown is proposed to be exported to the plant [29].
In further support of the labeling studies, Govindarajulu
et al. [29] showed elevated transcripts of G. intraradices
ornithine aminotransferase, a urease accessory protein
and an ammonium transporter in the intra-radical mycelium relative to the extra-radical mycelium.
Interestingly, the G. intraradices genes present on the M.
truncatula array include genes predicted to encode

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/10

enzymes of the urea cycle as well as amino acid metabolism. RT-PCR analysis showed that these genes were
expressed in G. intraradices-mycorrhizal roots, and analysis of the cell-type specific samples, indicates that they are
expressed in the arbuscules. These data extend the previous findings, showing that the genes of urea and amino
acid metabolism are expressed in the arbuscules. In addition, our data set includes a gene predicted to encode arginase that breaks down arginine to release ornithine and
urea. This is a key step for the release of ammonia and further supports the model proposed by Govindarajulu et al.
[29]. In addition to the urea cycle, we detected G. intraradices asparagine synthetase and glutamine synthetase gene
expression in arbuscules. This suggests that ornithine,
released via arginase activity, may be cycled into asparagine and glutamine through the action of asparagine synthetase and glutamine synthetase. Interestingly, the
metabolite profiling studies found higher levels of specific
amino acids, including Glu, Asp, and Asn in mycorrhizal
roots [84]. From these studies, it is not possible to determine whether the amino acids are in the plant or AM fungus, however, coupled with the gene expression studies,
there is evidence to suggest that at least some of this
amino acid accumulation may result from activities in the
fungus.

Conclusion
Using a combination of arrays, LM and RT-PCR, we have
extended the M. truncatula/G. intraradices mycorrhizal
root transcriptome and identified novel M. truncatula and
G. intraradices genes that are expressed in cortical cells harboring arbuscules. By virtue of their expression patterns,
the genes expressed in this cell type are candidates for
mediating aspects of development or function of the symbiotic arbuscule-cortical cell interface. Novel genes potentially involved in signaling and in N transport and
metabolism are of particular interest. This dataset will be
valuable for future studies aimed at determining the
molecular events that control arbuscule development,
and N transport and metabolism in the AM symbiosis.

Methods
Plant transformation
The pMtSCP1::GFP construct described in Liu et al. [36]
was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens (LBA4404)
and was used to transform Medicago truncatula cv.
Jemalong, (A17) according to Trieu and Harrison [87]
with minor modifications as described in Javot and Harrison [88]. Regenerated plants were selected with 1 mg L-1
bialaphos and were allowed to self pollinate. The progeny
were tested to verify the presence of the GFP and Bar
genes, and were inoculated with G. versiforme to verify the
mycorrhiza-inducible expression of sGFP [36]. Seed from
one transgenic line MtSCP-GFP1-1 (from the T3 or T4
generations) were used in the LM experiments.

Plant material, growth conditions and inoculation
methods
Plants were grown in a growth room under a 16 h light
(25°C) and 8 h dark (22°C) period. G. intraradices was
maintained in cultured carrot roots on plates, and spores
were prepared from the plates as described [89]. Stock cultures of G. versiforme was maintained on leek plants or
Bahia grass in pot culture and the preparation of surfacesterilized spores has been described previously
[36,90,91]. Plants were supplied with half-strength Hoagland's solution containing 20 μM potassium phosphate
twice a week.

For the GeneChip experiment, the root tissue was from
the same experiment as that described in Liu et al. [39].
Briefly, 14 day old M. truncatula (A17) plants were inoculated with 8,000 G. intraradices spores/pot and grown for
30 days. Roots were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Random samples were collected for the assessment of
their colonization levels with the gridline intersect
method [92]. The colonization levels of the three G. intraradices inoculated replicates used in the array experiment
were 49, 50 and 53% root length colonized (RLC) as
reported in Liu et al. [39]. For all other experiments, the
M. truncatula transgenic line pMtSCP1::GFP (T3 or T4 generation) was used.
To obtain highly colonized root pieces, 26 day old
pMtSCP1::GFP M. truncatula plants were transplanted in
large cones (4 × 20 cm: 1 plant per cone) and were inoculated with 800 G. versiforme spores per plant or mockinoculated with the last rinse from the spore surface sterilization procedure as described previously [36,90,91]. At
28 days post-inoculation, roots were examined under a
stereomicroscope equipped with UV-light, and regions of
the root system that showed green fluorescence (Additional file 3) were dissected out and immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C for RNA isolation.
Likewise, mock-inoculated pieces of roots were harvested
in a similar manner from similar regions of the mockinoculated root systems.
For the LM experiments, 15 day old or 23 day old
pMtSCP1::GFP M. truncatula plants were transplanted in
large cones and inoculated with 1000 G. versiforme spores
per plant or 1000 G. intraradices spores per plant, or mockinoculated as described previously. Plants were harvested
at 22 or 26 days post-inoculation with G. versiforme or G.
intraradices, respectively. The harvest of root sections took
place during the evening hours to facilitate the tissue preparation for LM.
Tissue preparation and laser microdissection
The method described was based on that of Kerk et al. [51]
with modifications. Instead of paraffin wax, the low melt-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/10

ing temperature Steedman's wax was used for embedding
root tissues. Steedman's wax was prepared by melting 900
g polyethylene glycol 400 distearate (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) and 100 g 1-hexadecanol (Sigma-Aldrich) at
65°C, and it was mixed thoroughly with a stirring bar. The
wax was stored in 50-ml sterile tubes and only the volume
needed was melted at 38°C.
M. truncatula SCP1::GFP root systems were submerged in
DEPC-treated autoclaved water and colonized regions
were selected based on expression of GFP as described
above. Mock-inoculated root pieces were collected in a
similar manner. Root pieces of between 4 and 8 mm long
were dissected and immediately transferred into 20-ml
RNase-free scintillation vials containing freshly prepared
Farmer's fixative (3:1 (v/v), ethanol: acetic acid). Roots
were incubated in the fixative for 12 h with rotation at
4°C, followed by dehydration also at 4°C, in the following ethanol series: 75% (v/v), 85%, 95% (with 0.1% eosin
y), 100% and 100% with transfer every 2 h. The quality of
RNA extracted from tissues in one block was evaluated by
the bioanalyzer (RIN = 6.7).
After the last ethanol step, half of the ethanol was
removed and the vials were incubated at 38°C for 10 min
prior to adding the molten Steedman's wax. Vials with 1:1
ethanol: wax, were incubated for 12 h at 38°C, and followed by 3 changes of 100% wax at 2 h intervals. Roots
were embedded in paper boats at room temperature.
Blocks were stored in plastic bags until they were processed.
Sectioning with Steedman's wax was performed at cool
room temperature (less than 23°C). Transverse root sections of 10–15 μm were made using a Leica RM 2235
rotary microtome (Leica Microsystems Inc., Bannockburn,
IL). Ribbons were arranged on UV-treated, 1 mm PENmembrane covered slides (P.A.L.M. Microlaser Technologies, Bernried, Germany) and they were stretched with a
few drops of DEPC-treated autoclaved water. Slides were
kept in a slide warmer at 32°C overnight. Sections were
de-waxed by pipetting 100% ethanol with a transfer
pipette several times until the wax was not visible anymore, and then dried at 32°C before the cell harvest.
The P.A.L.M. Microbeam system with a Robomover
(P.A.L.M. Microlaser Technologies) was used for LM. Cortical cells that contained arbuscules or cortical cells from
mock-inoculated roots were counted and marked (Additional files 3, 6). The contour of a cell or group of cells was
cut twice with the laser and target cells were automatically
catapulted into the cap of a microcentrifuge tube that contained RLT buffer (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) with β-mercaptoethanol. We harvested cortical cells containing G.
versiforme arbuscules or mock-inoculated controls from 2

biological replicates (each plant was a replicate). For G.
intraradices, cells from 3 plants were pooled as shown in
the Additional file 4. Cells were stored at -80°C until RNA
isolation.
RNA isolation
For the GeneChip Medicago genome arrays, root tissue
from 3 biological replicates (G. intraradices- or mock-inoculated plants) were ground in liquid nitrogen using a
mortar and pestle. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) with
additional phenol (pH 6.6): chloroform (1:1, v/v) and
chloroform purification steps. RNA was treated with
Turbo DNase I (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX), and column
purified with an RNeasy MinElute CleanUp kit (Qiagen).
RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer ND-100 (NanoDrop Technologies, Willington, DE)
and evaluated for purity with the bioanalyzer.

For the small dissected root samples, root pieces harvested
from 3 plants (G. versiforme- or mock-inoculated) were
pooled and ground with a disposable pellet pestle in a
centrifuge tube containing liquid nitrogen. Total RNA
from root sections or LM cortical cells was isolated with
the RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
RNA amplification
Five hundred nanograms of total RNA isolated from the
dissected root pieces were amplified using the TargetAmp
1-round aRNA amplification kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI). 3 μg of aRNA or total RNA [G. versiforme- or mock-inoculated aRNA, and G. intraradices- or
mock-inoculated RNA] were then treated twice with 1
Unit of Turbo DNase (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). After an
incubation of 20 min at 37°C each time, samples were
purified using phenol (pH6.6): chloroform (1:1, v/v) and
chloroform, followed by isopropanol precipitation.

Total RNA from LM cortical cells was amplified using the
TargetAmp 2-round aRNA amplification kit (Epicentre
Biotechnologies) and the aRNA yields are listed in Additional file 4.
Oligonucleotide design
Primers were designed using Primer3 software [93] and
the product sizes were less than 180 bp. To avoid non-specific product formation, oligonucleotides were designed
with reduced self and cross dimer ΔG using NetPrimer
software (PREMIER Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA).

cDNA synthesis and PCR conditions
First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1.5 μg of DNasetreated total RNA using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) with
500 ng anchored oligo (dT) primers in a 20 μl reaction.
For the aRNA, 600 ng of DNase-treated aRNA (1-round)
was reverse-transcribed using 500 ng random hexamers in
a 40 μl reaction. This reaction was incubated at room temperature for 5 min prior to 2 h cDNA synthesis at 50°C
and 15 min at 70°C. Following cDNA synthesis, either
110 μl or 35 μl of water were added to cDNA samples
derived from 600 ng aRNA or 1.5 μg total RNA, respectively. Each PCR reaction consisted of 1 μl cDNA in a 20
μl reaction with the following components: 4 μl 5× GoTaq
green reaction buffer, 0.4 μl 10 mM dNTP mix, 0.4 μl each
primer (10 μM), 0.5 Units of GoTaq DNA polymerase
(Promega Corporation, Madison, WI). The thermal profile consisted of incubation at 94°C for 1 min, followed
by 30 cycles at 94°C for 45 sec, maximum annealing temperature (see Additional file 7) for 45 sec, 72°C for 45 sec,
and a final incubation at 72°C for 5 min.

For RT-PCR of the LM aRNA samples, the cDNA was generated using gene-specific primers. Seventy five ng of
aRNA was mixed with 1 μl 10 mM dNTP mix and 0.25 μl
of gene-specific forward primer (10 μM), and incubated at
65°C for 5 min. 4 μl of 5× first-strand buffer, 1 μl 0.1 M
DTT, 10 Units of RNase OUT, 5 Units of SuperScript III
reverse transcriptase and DEPC-treated autoclaved water
up to 20 μl were added. cDNA synthesis was performed at
50°C for 2 h, followed by inactivation at 70°C for 15 min.
Each 20 μl PCR reaction included 5 μl of cDNA, 2 μl 10×
PCR buffer, 0.4 μl 10 mM dNTP mix, 0.4 μl each primer
(10 μM), 0.5 Units of HotStarTaq DNA polymerase (Qiagen) and autoclaved water. In order to minimize non-specific priming during amplification, we used touchdown
PCR as described previously [94]. The annealing step was
carried out at 5°C above and 3°C below the primer's
melting temperature as shown in the Additional file 7. The
touchdown thermal profile consisted of a 15 min heat
activation step at 95°C, followed by 10 cycles at 94°C for
30 sec, a ramp of -0.8°C per cycle (see Additional file 7 for
max and min temperatures) for 30 sec, 72°C for 1 min.
Additional 38 cycles at 94°C for 30 sec, minimum annealing temperature (see Additional file 7) for 30 sec, 72°C for
1 min, and a final incubation at 72°C for 10 min. All the
PCR products were visualized using 2% TAE-agarose gels
stained with ethidium bromide. The PCR product of one
LM sample (TC110731) was sequenced to confirm identity.
GeneChip® Medicago genome array labeling and
hybridization
The Affymetrix GeneChip® Medicago Genome Array
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was used for expression
analysis. RNA from three independent biological repli-

cates was analyzed for each treatment. 5 μg of columnpurified total RNA were used for one-cycle eukaryotic target labeling. Targets were hybridized to the arrays; probe
arrays were washed, stained and scanned according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix).
GeneChip® data acquisition and analysis
Data normalization between chips was conducted using
Robust Multi-chip Average (RMA) [95]. Presence/absence
call for each probe set was obtained using dCHIP [96].
Gene selections based on associative t-test [97] were made
using MATLAB® (MathWorks, Natick, MA). Details of this
method were presented previously [60]. A selection
threshold of 2 for transcript ratios (where applicable) and
a Bonferroni-correction p-value threshold of 1.14 × 10-6
were used. False discovery rate of all significant genes was
monitored with q-values obtained by EDGE software
[98,99].

Sequence of TC86704 predicted to encode a G. versiforme ferritinlike protein. This TC is assembled from ESTs from a Glomus versiforme
spore cDNA library. Several ESTs were sequenced and they assembled into
TC85704 that represents almost the complete coding sequence of the gene.
The predicted protein shares over 54% amino acid identity with ferritin
from Triatoma infestans, a blood sucking arthropod and 52% identity
with ferritin from Suberites domuncula, a marine sponge. The finding
of a putative G. versiforme ferritin-like gene is surprising because based
on BLAST searches, sequences similar to this are not present in other
fungi. In general fungi use diverse approaches to obtain and store iron
including a range of siderophores such as ferricrocin or hydroxamate-type
siderophores that are synthesize by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases
[100-102].
