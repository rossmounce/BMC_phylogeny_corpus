Abstract
Background: The 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome -22q11.2DS) refers to congenital
abnormalities, including primarily heart defects and facial dysmorphy, thymic hypoplasia, cleft palate and
hypocalcaemia. Microdeletion within chromosomal region 22q11.2 constitutes the molecular basis of this
syndrome. The 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome occurs in 1/4000 births. The aim of this study was to determine
the frequency of 22q11.2 microdeletion in 87 children suffering from a congenital heart defect (conotruncal or
non-conotruncal) coexisting with at least one additional 22q11.2DS feature and to carry out 22q11.2 microdeletion
testing of the deleted children’s parents. We also attempted to identify the most frequent heart defects in both
groups and phenotypic traits of patients with microdeletion to determine selection criteria for at risk patients.
Methods: The analysis of microdeletions was conducted using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on
metaphase chromosomes and interphase nuclei isolated from venous peripheral blood cultures. A molecular probe
(Tuple) specific to the HIRA (TUPLE1, DGCR1) region at 22q11 was used for the hybridisation.
Results: Microdeletions of 22q11.2 region were detected in 13 children with a congenital heart defect (14.94% of
the examined group). Microdeletion of 22q11.2 occurred in 20% and 11.54% of the conotruncal and nonconotruncal groups respectively. Tetralogy of Fallot was the most frequent heart defect in the first group of
children with 22q11.2 microdeletion, while ventricular septal defect and atrial septal defect/ventricular septal defect
were most frequent in the second group. The microdeletion was also detected in one of the parents of the
deleted child (6.25%) without congenital heart defect, but with slight dysmorphism. In the remaining children,
22q11.2 microdeletion originated de novo.
Conclusions: Patients with 22q11.2DS exhibit wide spectrum of phenotypic characteristics, ranging from discreet
to quite strong. The deletion was inherited by one child. Our study suggests that screening for 22q11.2
microdeletion should be performed in children with conotruncal and non-conotruncal heart defects and with at
least one typical feature of 22q11.2DS as well as in the deleted children’s parents.

Background
The syndrome of 22q11.2 microdeletions comprises a
set of developmental abnormalities, including primarily
heart and craniofacial congenital defects. The syndrome
is characterised by various phenotypic changes described
earlier in DiGeorge, Takao and Shprintzen syndromes.
It is the most common microdeletion in the population

(1/4000 births) [1]. The 22q11.2DS is inherited in an
autosomal dominant manner [2].
In 1993, nosological entities caused by microdeletions
in this region were given a common name of CATCH
22, which is an acronym formed by the first letters of
the phenotypic traits accompanying this syndrome: C cardiac defect, A - abnormal face, T - thymic hypoplasia, C - cleft palate, H -hypocalcaemia [3]. However, the
spectrum of clinical features of this syndrome is considerably wider than that indicated by the name CATCH.
In the light of the latest investigations, 22q11.2

microdeletion occurs also in patients suffering from the
Cayler syndrome and Opitz/GBBB. Therefore, the name
CATCH 22 was replaced by 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome and is known under this name today [4]. Dysmorphy traits are characteristic for the entire 22q11.2
microdeletion syndrome. The most common ones
include: elongated face, low-set small dysplastic ears,
microstomia, small teeth, congenital tooth or enamel
agenesis, almond-shaped eyes, hypertelorism, prominent
long bulbous nose, retro- and micrognathia, short neck
and characteristic arachnodactyly. The above-listed traits
can be clearly pronounced or barely noticeable making
phenotypic diagnostics very difficult.
Approximately 180 signs of the 22q11.2DS have been
described to date. These include abnormalities of the
urinary-reproductive, skeletal, gastrointestinal, nervous
and immunological systems as well as psychiatric disturbances. Moreover, considerable changes in the phenotype expression are observed in persons with a deletion
of the same size, belonging to the same family or even
in monozygotic twins [5]. In the light of these facts, it is
difficult to determine the correlation between genotype
and phenotype in patients with 22q11.2DS [6]. Causes
can be attributed to: heterogeneity, pleiotropy, variations
in mutation penetration, varying impact of environmental effects as well as other factors or events affecting the
foetus [7].
In 90% of patients, the identified microdeletion covers
the region of 3 Mbp, encoding 30 genes, referred to as
the typically deleted region (TDR), e.g. DGCR6, PRODH,
IDD, TUPLE1, UFDL1, TBX1, ZNF74, CRKL, whereas
microdeletion of 1.5 Mbp including 24 genes has been
found in 8% of patients. A minimal DiGeorge critical
region (MDGCR) covers about 0.5 Mbp and several
genes: CTP, CLTD, TUPLE1, UFD1, TBX1, CDC45 [8].
The remaining 2% include patients with other chromosomal aberrations (e.g. del10p) [9]. Interestingly,
the intensity of clinical symptoms is not correlated with
the size of microdeletions [10]. Atypical deletions in the
22q11.2 region are rare. In patients with chromosome
22q11.2 microduplication syndrome, similar phenotype
can be found.
The 22q11.2 microdeletion accounts for 5% of all
heart defects in newborns [11]. In approximately 10-20%
of patients the 22q11.2 microdeletion does not originate
de novo but is also found in one of the parents who was
not earlier identified as the mutation carrier [12]. A
phenotype similar to the 22q11.2DS may also result
from environmental factors such as diabetes or alcoholic
disease affecting the foetus as well as from increased or
decreased levels of retinoic acid (vitamin A) in the
mother’s organism [13].
The aim of this study was to determine the frequency
of the 22q11.2 microdeletion in (i) 87 children with a

Page 2 of 7

congenital heart defect (37 conotruncal and 50 non-conotruncal cases) and at least one additional 22q11.2DS
feature, (ii) a group of the deleted children’s parents.
We also attempted to establish the correlation of the
most frequent heart defects in both groups and characteristic phenotype in patients with 22q11.2 microdeletion to determine selection criteria for at risk patients.

Methods
FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) method was
used in a group of 87 children with a congenital heart
defect at least one additional 22q11.2DS feature: facial
dysmorphy, thymic or parathyroid gland hypoplasia or
aplasia, cleft palate or lip and hypocalcaemia during the
neonatal period or accompanying abnormalities of urinary-reproductive, skeletal, gastrointestinal or nervous
systems. The patients were divided into two groups:
with conotruncal (n = 35) and non-conotruncal heart
defects (n = 52). The examined group comprised 39
girls and 48 boys. The average age of all examined children was 2 years (0-6 years); thirty one patients
(35.63%) were newborns.
Additionally, seventeen of the deleted children’s parents were included in the study. In one case, only one
of the parents was examined. Having obtained a written
consent of the parents, blood samples for genetic analyses were taken from the patients. The following analyses were performed: case history analysis, cardiologic
examination and detailed pedigree and karyotype analysis as well as object examination together with phenotype assessment.
In all cases, the heart anatomy and physiology were
diagnosed by echocardiography. In complex cardiac
defects cardiac catheterization was performed. The thymus and parathyroid glands were visualized by ultrasound, and CT or MRI. Assessment of parathyroid
dysfunction included detailed clinical history regarding
the symptoms of hypocalcaemia and the following biological features: concentration of total calcium (normal
range 2.2-2.6 mmol/l), phosphate (normal range 0.8-1.45
mmol/l) and ionized calcium (normal range 1.17-1.30
mmol/l). Low calcium levels in the blood indicated
hypocalcaemia (total calcium <2.2 mmol/l; ionized calcium <1.17 mmol/l).
Heparinised lymphocytes of venous peripheral blood
(0.5-1 ml each) stimulated with phytohemagglutinin
were used for the cytogenetic studies. Isolated cells were
grown and harvested in accordance with standard procedures. The obtained chromosome preparations were
stained with the GTG standard method [14]. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using DiGeorge (Tuple)
Region Probe Dual Colour (Qbiogene) was performed
according to the procedure established by the manufacturer. This probe is specific to the HIRA (TUPLE1,

DGCR1) region at 22q11. The hybridization signals were
documented with a Zeiss-Axiophot fluorescent microscope and analysed with CytoVision 3.52 software.
The study was approved by the Ethic Committee at
the Poznan University of Medical Sciences.

Results
Microdeletions in the region q11.2 of the 22 chromosome were identified in the group of fourteen patients thirteen children with a congenital heart defect
(conotruncal and non-conotruncal) and at least one additional trait from the 22q11.2DS spectrum (14.94% of children from the analysed group) and one parent of a
deleted child. Patients were classified into 2 groups based
on the conotruncal and non-conotruncal cardiac defects.
Microdeletion of 22q11.2 occurred in 20% and 11.54% of
the first (7/35 conotruncal patients) and the second
group of children (6/52 non-conotruncal patients)
respectively. The congenital heart defects and details of
phenotypic abnormalities are described in Table 1.
The analysed group of patients with the microdeletion
comprised nine girls and four boys. The mean age on
the day of examination was one year and two months,
with seven patients diagnosed in the first month, three in the first year and the remaining patients in the
second, third and sixth year of life. The performed karyotype analysis of all patients did not reveal any
abnormalities regarding the number and structure of
chromosomes.
Microdeletion of 22q11.2 was detected in 1/17 parents
of nine children. The parent with microdeletion did not

Page 3 of 7

have any diagnosed heart defects and exhibited only
slight dysmorphism- ear dysplasia and arachnodactyly.
The above-mentioned features were more pronounced
in his child. Microdeletion was not detected in any
other parent, which indicates that in the case of 7 children 22q11.2 microdeletion originated de novo.
Pedigree analysis of all the patients revealed the family
history with a congenital heart defect in 14 cases
(16.09%). Parents of the deleted children did not harbour any congenital defects including heart or other
principal trait characteristics for the 22q11.2DS.

Discussion
Microdeletion of 22q11.2 was detected in 14.94% of the
examined patients (Table 2). Other authors indicate
wide range of prevalence rate depending on different
selection criteria [15-19]. The frequency of 20% and
11.54% was observed in the first and second group of
patients respectively. The published data reveal frequency of 22q11.2 microdeletion in conotruncal and
dysmorphic patients at the level of 15.8% and 25%
respectively [19,20]. Our data shows increased prevalence of 22q11.2 microdeletion (11.54%) in patients with
non-conotruncal heart defect and at least one typical
feature of this syndrome compared to other research
studies whose results equalled 8.3% and 10% [18,21]. As
postulated by Tobias et al., these results probably contribute to the expansion of the clinical and phenotypic criteria used in screening of patients at risk for 22q11
microdeletion [22]. It should be mentioned that data
which indicate occurrence of this deletion in patients

with conotruncal or non-conotruncal heart defects without characteristic phenotype show very low percentage
of the mutation (0%, 5.7%, 6.5%) [18,23,24]. However,
the dysmorphic features may be overlooked and extracardiac defects (i.e. mental retardation) may appear later.
The obtained frequencies of occurrence of the remaining heart defects were similar to the data derived from
the European multi-centre research on the spectrum of
phenotypic traits in patients with 22q11.2DS as well as
from published literature data. As indicated in the literature the most frequent heart defects in children with
22q11.2DS include: tetralogy of Fallot, ventricular septal
defect, interrupted aortic arch, pulmonary valve atresia
with ventricular septal defect, persistent truncus arteriosus, transposition of the great arteries and atrial septal
defect [17,18,25].
Facial dysmorphia is another typical feature for
22q11.2DS is facial dysmorphia. Our study indicated

dysmorphic nature of discreet to strong expression,
which is identical to the results of other researchers
(Table 1, 2) [25,17,26]. In newborns with microdeletions,
problems with milk suckling and regurgitation, associated with palatopharyngeal insufficiency, are often
observed. However, the problems with food intake are
not necessarily caused by cleft lips and palate. It has
been estimated that delayed speech development and
rhinolalia may occur in up to 50% of patients in this
group [27].
In many children with 22q11.2DS and disturbed thymus function, decreased immunity, increased proportion
of complications after heart operations and higher mortality rate are observed [28]. For this reason it is
believed that these children should be vaccinated at a
later date than recommended in the vaccination schedule. Only in about 5% of patients with the 22q11.2DS
microdeletion bone marrow transplantation or thymus

Wozniak et al. BMC Pediatrics 2010, 10:88
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2431/10/88

transplantation might be necessary [29]. It has also been
shown that thymus dysfunction predisposes patients
with the deletion to different autoimmune diseases, i.e.
juvenile arthritis, thrombocytopenia and Graves-Basedov
disease [30]. In our group of patients, thymic hypoplasia
coexisted with typical dysmorphic changes only in one
child. In two patients with thymic hypoplasia, no signs
of facial dysmorphy were observed. In two remaining
cases the changes were considerably milder.
Another sign complicating the course of the neonatal
period in the examined patients with 22q11.2DS was
hypocalcaemia [31]. It should be emphasised that in our
studies, thymic or parathyroid gland hypoplasia as well
as hypocalcaemia occurred exclusively in the group of
children with the 22q11.2 microdeletion. A similar relationship was found in experiments conducted by Koch
et al., who carried out comparative investigations of calcium and thyroid hormone levels in two groups of
adults with and without microdeletion. One group comprised patients with confirmed 22q11.2DS and congenital heart defect secondary to the conotruncal heart
defect (tricuspid atresia, tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary
atresia with ventricular septal defect, interrupted aortic
arch type B), while the other group was formed by
patients with similar heart defects but without confirmed microdeletions [31,32]. Therefore, thymic or
parathyroid gland hypoplasia coexisting with a congenital heart defect should indicate the need to carry out
genetic examinations for 22q11.2DS.
Currently, more attention is being devoted to problems of psychiatric, psychological and behavioural nature in patients with the 22q11.2 microdeletion. In the
examined group of children with 22q11.2DS, one patient
was diagnosed with slight mental retardation and
another with delayed psychomotor development. However, it is worth emphasising that the majority of children were examined during the neonatal period when it
is difficult to determine unequivocally if the psycho-physical development of a child is normal. According to
investigations carried out by other researchers, the average value of the intelligence quotient (IQ) in deleted
patients amounts to 75 and abnormal development is
observed in approximately 35-40% of patients with
microdeletion [33]. Most frequently, problems in learning and abstract thinking are observed [34]. Therefore,
in properly developed newborns and infants with
22q11.2DS, it is impossible to rule out their incorrect
development in the future, which could be attributed to
the 22q11.2 microdeletion. This remark also refers to
psychiatric diseases. Increased incidence (up to 20%) of
depressions, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder was
demonstrated in adult patients with 22q11.2DS. Hemizygotic deletion on chromosome 22 was found in 2-5% of
patients suffering from schizophrenia [35].

Diagnosis based on a clinical picture exclusively may
be difficult due to the fact that 22q11.2 microdeletion
phenotype is not always fully developed, dysmorphy may
vary from very pronounced to quite discreet and
patients may show non-typical signs. Our studies indicate that it is necessary to perform the analysis of the
22q11.2 microdeletion not only in children with congenital heart defect secondary to conotruncal heart defect
but also in patients with other heart defects coexisting
with at least one feature from the 22q11.2DS spectrum.
Literature data reveal that about 10-20% of patients
inherit 22q11.2 microdeletion from one of the parents
[12]. Frequently, the phenotype of affected parents exhibits none or only discreet traits of 22q11.2DS. This can
probably be attributed to variable levels of penetration
of this mutation. It is evident from experiments carried
out on monozygotic twins that the 22q11.2 microdeletion of identical size can cause varying phenotype consequences [36]. On the other hand, studies conducted by
Adeyinka et al. suggested familial origin of small-sized
deletions. Exceptionally large differences may relate to
congenital heart defects [37]. Genetic analyses of the
22q11.2 region carried out in two groups of patients
with familial incidence of congenital heart defects
revealed that this change is inherited in 44% and 13% of
patients respectively [27,38].
The high frequency of 22q11.2 microdeletions originating de novo might suggest considerable genomic
instability in this region of chromosome 22. The genetic
mechanism behind the microdeletion is based on nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR). The same
aetiology has been observed in the case of other
microdeletions - Angelman (15q11-q13 microdeletion),
Prader-Willi (15q11-q13 microdeletion) and WilliamsBeuren (7q11.2 microdeletion) syndromes [7].
It is believed that some of the patients with the
22q11.2DS phenotype do not have a chromosomal
microdeletion but that they are likely to be carriers of
mutations in one or more genes [8]. This fact has been
observed in other microdeletion syndromes as, for
example, William’s and Wolf-Hirschhorn’s syndromes
(4p16.3 microdeletion). In the majority of cases, the
22q11.2 microdeletion locus comprises approximately 30
genes. Comprehensive functional studies on animal
models revealed that TBX1 is the only gene with haploinsufficiency that results in the occurrence of a phenotype characteristic for the 22q11.2DS [39]. TBX1 gene
encodes phylogenetically conservative transcription factor which takes part in the regulation of developmental
processes. The extensive mechanisms in which it is
involved create many possible ways for the development
of abnormalities caused by haploinsufficiency - lack,
excess or incorrect structure of the TBX1 gene. The discovery of the mutation in the TBX1 gene in a patient

Wozniak et al. BMC Pediatrics 2010, 10:88
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2431/10/88

with the microdeletion phenotype and the recognition of
its impact on the TBX1 protein accelerated the understanding of the molecular basis of 22q11.2 microdeletion
syndrome [11].
It is possible to diagnose the 22q11.2 microdeletion
using other diagnostic methods than FISH, ie. high resolution comparative genomic hybridization (HR-CGH),
multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification
(MLPA), short tandem repeats (STR) as well as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). These methods
enable researchers to estimate the size of microdeletions, determine chromosomal breakpoints and perform
segregation analysis [40].
Regardless of the methods applied to diagnose
22q11.2DS, early diagnosis is crucial. This is why the
possibility of prenatal identification of congenital heart
defects begins to play an important role. The result of
echocardiographic examinations confirming a heart
defect in the foetus can frequently give the baby a
chance to survive as adequate care can be provided. In
addition, the result could qualify newborns to a risk
group and indicate the need to perform genetic analysis.
This assumption was confirmed by investigations carried
out by Moore et al. who prenatally diagnosed foetuses
by means of USG. They demonstrated that 41% of foetuses with congenital heart defect had an incorrect karyotype and 3% had 22q11.2 microdeletion [41].
Long-term studies carried out in several research centres indicate that children with congenital heart defects
are most likely to undergo examinations for microdeletions on chromosome 22 while being the patients on
paediatric cardiology wards, even though they are under
the care of other specialists [28]. Our studies also confirmed the above data as 70% of patients that we diagnosed with the 22q11.2 microdeletion were referred to
the examinations by the physicians from the Department of Paediatric Cardiology and Nephrology of the
Poznan University of Medical Sciences.

Conclusions
There is a wide spectrum of phenotypic characteristics
that occur in patients with the 22q11.2DS. This syndrome is characterized by a highly variable expression of
phenotype, ranging from discreet to quite strong. ToF
was the most frequent conotruncal heart defect in the
group of children with 22q11.2 microdeletion, while
ASDII+VSD and VSD were the most common in the
non-conotruncal group. Our studies indicate that
patients with moderate heart defects (atrial or ventricular) or frequently observed complete absence of dysmorphism exhibit a typical but rare thymic hypoplasia.
In one familial case of the 22q11.2DS, no cardio-vascular defect was identified in the parent who was the
microdeletion carrier, despite the fact that tetralogy of

Page 6 of 7

Fallot was diagnosed in the child with the same
mutation.
Many patients with the 22q11.2DS additionally suffer
from accompanying defects, primarily, associated with
urinary-reproductive, skeletal, gastrointestinal, nervous
systems and the organ of sight. Therefore, at various
stages of life they will require multi- and highly-specialized care of cardiologists, cardiosurgeons, immunologists, orthopaedists, psychologists and psychiatrists. Such
long-term and specialized care over patients with the
22q11.2DS is provided, for example, in Goteborg, Tokyo
or Philadelphia [7]. It should also be emphasised that
patients with this syndrome as well as their families
should be under genetic supervision. Our observations
suggest that the criteria in searching for microdeletion
22q11.2 should be expanded and applied in patients
with conotruncal and non-conotruncal congenital heart
defects and at least one typical feature of this syndrome
(facial dysmorphy, thymus hypoplasia, cleft palate or
hypocalcaemia) as well as in the deleted children’s
parents.
