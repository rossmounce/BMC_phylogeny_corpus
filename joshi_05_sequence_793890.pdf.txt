Abstract
Background: Spiroplasma citri BR3-3X and S. kunkelii CR2-3X cause serious diseases worldwide on citrus and
maize species, respectively. S. citri BR3-3X harbors a plasmid, pBJS-Original (pBJS-O), that encodes the
spiroplasma adhesion related protein 1 (SARP1), a protein implicated in binding of the pathogen to cells of its
leafhopper vector, Circulifer tenellus. The S. kunkelii CR2-3X plasmid, pSKU146, encodes a homolog of SARP1, SkARP1. Due to the close phylogenetic relationship of the two pathogens, we hypothesized that the two plasmids
are closely related as well.
Results: The nucleotide sequence of pBJS-O was determined and compared to the sequences of a plasmid from
BR3-T (pBJS-T), which is a multiply passaged leafhopper transmissible derivative of BR3-3X, and to known plasmid
sequences including that of pSKU146. In addition to arp1, the 13,374 bp pBJS-O sequence putatively contains nine
genes, recognized as open reading frames (ORFs). Several pBJS-O ORFs have homologs on pSKU146. However,
the sequences flanking soj-like genes on both plasmids were found to be more distant from one another than
sequences in any other region. Further, unlike pSKU146, pBJS-O lacks the conserved oriT region characteristic of
the IncP group of bacterial plasmids. We were unable to identify a region in pBJS-O resembling a known plasmid
origin of transfer. In regions where sequence was available for the plasmid from both BR3-3X and BR3-T, the
pBJS-T sequence had a 0.4 kb deletion relative to its progenitor, pBJS-O. Southern blot hybridization of
extrachromosomal DNA from various S. citri strains and spiroplasma species to an arp-specific probe and a probe
made from the entire plasmid DNA of BR3-3X revealed limited conservation of both sequences in the genus
Spiroplasma. Finally, we also report the presence on the BR3-3X chromosome of arp2, an S. citri homolog of arp1
that encodes the predicted protein SARP2. The C-terminal domain of SARP2 is homologous to that of SARP1,
but its N-terminal domain is distinct.
Conclusion: Our data suggest that pBJS is a novel S. citri plasmid that does not belong to any known plasmid
incompatibility group. The differences between pBJS-O and pSKU146 suggest that one or more events of
recombination have contributed to the divergence of the plasmids of the two sister Spiroplasma species; the
plasmid from S. citri itself has diverged slightly during the derivation of S. citri BR3-T from BR3-3X. Our data also
show that pBJS-O encodes the putative adhesin SARP1. The presence of traE and mob on pBJS-O suggests a role
for the plasmid in spiroplasmal conjugation.

Background
The phytopathogenic spiroplasmas and phytoplasmas,
which cause serious diseases of economically important
plant species worldwide [[1] and [2]], are wall-less
prokaryotes phylogenetically related to Gram-positive
eubacteria with low G+C content [3]. They are transmitted
in nature by phloem-feeding insects, predominantly leafhoppers, in a propagative manner [4]. Even though there
are close to forty recognized spiroplasma species, only
three plant pathogenic spiroplasmas have been identified
and characterized to date. S. citri [[5,6] and [7]] is the
causative agent of stubborn disease of citrus and brittle
root disease of horseradish; S. kunkelii [[8,9] and [10]] is
the etiological agent of corn stunt; and S. phoeniceum [11]
causes periwinkle yellows. Unlike phytoplasmas,
spiroplasmas can be cultured in vitro. Therefore, the relationships between S. citri and its insect vectors, the beet
leafhopper, Circulifer tenellus, and the related species, C.
haematoceps [12], have been investigated extensively, serving as models for investigating the molecular aspects of
mollicute-vector interactions.
Spiroplasma binding to insect host and non-host cells,
both in tissue-culture and within the intact insect, has
been reported [[13] and [14]]. The loss and restoration of
the ability of S. citri to adhere to tissue-cultured C. tenellus
cells was associated with degradation and restoration of
P89 (designated SARP1), a spiroplasma membrane protein [14]. Due to the possible direct involvement of
SARP1 in the spiroplasma-leafhopper interaction, it was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/175

hypothesized that SARP1 is an adhesin. Later, Berg et al
[15] reported cloning and characterization of arp1, the
gene encoding SARP1, from S. citri BR3-T. They also
reported that mature SARP1 protein contains a novel
domain at the N-terminus, called "sarpin", made of six
repeats of 39–42 amino acids each.
S. citri harbors several extrachromosomal DNAs with
unique restriction patterns [[16-18] and [19]]. S. citri
lines, derived from a clone, and sister clones of the same
lines showed differences in their extrachromosomal
DNAs [20]. In addition to known plasmids, there are replicative forms (RFs) of several viruses and other uncharacterized circular extrachromosomal DNAs in S. citri [21].
Plasmids have also been noted in strains of S. kunkelii
[22]. Recently, Davis and colleagues [23] reported the
complete sequence of the S. kunkelii CR2-3X plasmid
pSKU146, which encodes a homolog of SARP1, Sk-ARP1.
In the present study, we isolated and characterized a
related indigenous plasmid, designated pBJS-Original
(pBJS-O), from S. citri BR3-3X. This is a report of the discovery, distribution and characterization of that plasmid.
Among other genes, pBJS-O contains arp1. The significance of the discovery of pBJS-O in relation to our current
understanding of the S. citri-leafhopper interactions and
potential genetic manipulations in mollicutes is discussed. Implications for the evolution of both pBJS-O and
pSKU146 are also presented.

Detection and analysis of arp2
SARP1 has been characterized previously and the gene
encoding it, arp1, has been cloned and sequenced [GenBank:AJ297706] from S. citri BR3-T [15]. In the process,
an RsaI restriction fragment was cloned and sequenced
from BR3-T genomic DNA; the alignment of this fragment
with AJ297706 revealed 92% similarity in the 3' 660
nucleotides of the former sequence. However in the 5' 55
bases of the total 715 bp, upstream from position 2370 in
AJ297706, the new fragment was not similar to the known
sequence. We designated this gene, which resembles but is
not identical to arp1, as arp2 and its putative protein product as SARP2. As also noted by Bai et al. [22], the S. kunkelii
CR2-3X genome contains two sequences similar to those
of S. citri BR3-T arp genes. The predicted protein, Sk-ARP1
(for S. kunkelii adhesion related protein 1), encoded by
the first sequence, Sk-arp1, contains seven rather than six
sarpin repeats and has C-terminal domains resembling
those of SARP1 [15]. The second sequence encodes a putative protein whose C-terminus is homologous to that of
SARP1, but has an unrelated N-terminus. This protein is
designated Sk-ARP2 (S. kunkelii adhesion related protein
2) and the corresponding gene is named Sk-arp2. SARP1
has sequence similarity with known adhesins. Fleury et al.

S. melliferum, S. phoeniceum and S. kunkelii CR2-3X were used. The blot shown in panel A was stripped and rehybridized using
the whole pBJS-O probe, shown in panel B.

[24] have shown that the predicted amino acid sequence
of P40, a Mycoplasma agalactiae cytadhesin, is similar not
only to that of SARP1 but also to the one of P50, an
adhesin of M. hominis.
Isolation and distribution of Spiroplasma
extrachromosomal DNA
We isolated extrachromosomal DNA from S. citri BR3-3X
to test the hypothesis that this DNA contains an arp-like
gene as in S. kunkelii. Restriction of the DNA with single
enzymes, including BglII and NdeI, converted a DNA
migrating with 9 kb into a fragment migrating close to 7
kb (Fig. 1). These results were consistent with the presence
of a single major plasmid. We designated the plasmid
pBJS-O. By nucleotide sequencing, we determined that
the actual size of the plasmid was 13,374 bp and deposited the sequence in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database [EMBL:AJ972409]

To test the conservation of pBJS-O in S. citri strains
derived from S. citri BR3, plasmid preparations from S.
citri BR3-3X and from BR3-G, BR3-T, BR3-M and BR3-P,

lines derived from BR3-3X, were probed with a DNA fragment derived from arp1 (Fig. 2 and Table 1). All hybridized with the probe, producing two or more bands. To test
the conservation of pBJS-O in other S. citri strains, other
plant-associated spiroplasmas and the closest relative of S.
citri, S. melliferum [25], the plasmids of S. kunkelii CR2-3X,
S. melliferum, S. citri strains R8A2, ASP-1 and Beni Mellal,
S. floricola and S. phoeniceum also were probed with the
arp1-derived probe (Fig. 3A). Only S. kunkelii CR2-3X and
S. melliferum reacted in the hybridization. However, when
the same plasmids were probed with the whole pBJS-O
plasmid as a probe (Fig. 3B), all the sample preparations,
except those from S. citri Beni Mellal, S. floricola and S.
phoeniceum, hybridized with the probe. All of the above
Southern hybridization experiments revealed multiple
reactive species in the plasmid preparations and the
hybridization patterns of EcoRI-digested and undigested
plasmid samples were very similar to each other. For comparison, the blots included EcoRI-digested chromosomal
DNA of S. citri BR3-3X. A single hybridization signal distinct from those of plasmid preparations was observed
(Fig. 2).

last sequence alignment. Gaps are denoted by dashed lines,
whereas dots denote identical bases.
arp1 and arp2 locations in S. citri BR3-3X
The Southern blot hybridization results suggest that arprelated sequences are present on both a plasmid and the
chromosome. arp1 and arp2 from BR3-T are nearly identical over a considerable portion of their nucleotide
sequence. Hence, using a probe containing this conserved
region should detect both genes. Nevertheless, arp1 and
arp2 differ at several positions in those regions. To determine whether the BR3-3X plasmid and chromosomal
sequences represented arp1 or arp2 genes, we determined
parts of the sequences of BR3-3X plasmid and chromosomal DNAs by direct sequencing and by sequencing
amplified PCR products. Comparison of the BR3-3X arp
sequences with those of BR3-T revealed that the BR3-3X
arp2 sequence had diverged more from the other three
sequences than the latter had from each other (Figs. 4 and
5). At positions where the two BR3-T genes differed from
one another, the chromosomal BR3-3X sequence had arp2
residues in 21 positions and arp1 residues in only 3 positions (Figs. 4A and 4B). Conversely, at arp1- and arp2-specific positions, the BR3-3X plasmid DNA had no arp2
residues and 28 arp1 residues. Further, at all 57 positions
at which chromosomal and plasmid sequences differed,
the BR3-3X plasmid and arp1 nucleotides were identical.
Hence, we conclude that, in S. citri BR3-3X, the arp1 gene
resides on a plasmid and that the arp2 gene most likely

resides on the chromosome. The newly determined arp2
sequences from BR3-3X and BR3-T were deposited in the
EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database [EMBL:AM040506
and EMBL:AM040505, respectively].
Complete pBJS-O sequencing and analysis
The 4273 bp sequence [GenBank:AJ297706] originally
cloned and characterized from S. citri BR3-T [15] contains
a partial ORF soj, followed by ORF2, P89 (arp1) and
another partial ORF, ORF4. AJ297706 was used to design
primers and initiate primer walking to determine the
complete pBJS-O plasmid sequence and allow its characterization. During sequencing, a segment (from nucleotide 1–80) of the assembled sequence proved
particularly difficult to sequence. It contained three of the
six oligopurine/oligopyrimidine tracts of 12 or more bp in
the entire plasmid sequence. That the sequence of the
tracts was consistent with triple-helix formation suggests
that this region of the plasmid may readily form triplehelical
structures
interfering
with
sequencing.

The total plasmid sequence is 13,374 bp in length and
contains ten predicted ORFs (Fig. 6 and Table 2), of which
orf2 (S. citri ORF2) has no homologs, and orf9 and orf10
appear to have distant relatives (E values 0.34 and 0.024,
respectively). Of the ten, six putative pBJS-O-ORFs have
homologs in pSKU146, the recently characterized S. kunkelii CR2-3X plasmid [16]: arp1 (adhesin protein; E value
0.0), orf4 (hypothetical protein pSKU146_11; E value
0.0), traE (conjugation ATPase; E value 0.0), orf6 (hypothetical protein pSKU146_13; E value 9 × 10-45), mob
(mobilization protein; E value 0.0) and orf8 (hypothetical
protein pSKU146_17; E value 1 × 10-103). Predicted products of traE and mob are similar to proteins involved in
conjugative DNA transfer in other bacterial genera. In the
regions where the plasmid sequence was available from
both BR3-3X and BR3-T, pBJS-T (the plasmid from S. citri
BR3-T) sequence had a 0.4 kb deletion relative to pBJS-O,

bringing the orf4 gene close to arp1 and traE. In BR3-3X,
however, arp1 and orf4 are separated by 281 bp. The
nucleotide sequence variations between pBJS-O and pBJST were found to be clustered. Two regions of enhanced
variation were observed over a 200 bp stretch in the
ORF2-arp1 intergenic region (positions 2700 to 2900 in
pBJS-O). In a comparable stretch from position 5262 to
5544 in the arp1-ORF4 intergenic region, a single stretch
of
dissimilarity
was
found.
Algorithm TMHMM v. 2.0 was used to predict the locations of transmembrane helices and intervening loops in
the putative products of traE (Fig. 7), mob and orf4.
Although the TraE polypeptide was predicted to contain
three transmembrane helices, the third helix was predicted at a lower probability than were the other two.
Assuming the presence of three transmembrane helices,
the protein was predicted to have the N-terminal region
(about 10% of the length of the polypeptide) in the
cytosol and almost all of the rest of the protein extracellular.
Plasmid pSKU146 from S. kunkelii CR2-3X encodes the S.
kunkelii homolog of SARP1, Sk-ARP1. In addition to skarp1, pSKU146 contains 17 ORFs. The pSKU146-ORFs
having counterparts on pBJS-O were listed above. However, although both plasmids contain genes encoding the
ParA-like protein, Soj, sequences surrounding those genes
are more distant from one another than are sequences in
any other regions. Further, unlike pSKU146, pBJS-O lacks
the conserved oriT region characteristic of the IncP group
of bacterial plasmids. Also, we were unable to identify a
region in pBJS-O resembling a known plasmid origin of
transfer.

In the present study we report isolation, distribution and
structural characterization of pBJS-O, an indigenous S.
citri BR3-3X plasmid. We also present evidence that pBJSO harbors arp1, the gene encoding SARP1, and describe
the presence on the BR3-3X chromosome of arp2, an S.
citri homolog of arp1. Finally, the sequences of pBJS-O,
pBJS-T and the S. kunkelii CR2-3X plasmid, pSKU146, in
relation to plasmid evolution are discussed.
Conservation of arp and pBJS-O sequences in
Spiroplasma
In Southern hybridizations, the similarity in the hybridization patterns of EcoRI digested versus undigested pBJSO preparations, despite the presence of two GAATTC recognition sequences, may be due to an adenine methylation system in S. citri. Restriction site modification in S.
citri has been reported elsewhere. Rascoe et al. [26]
detected multiple bands of S. citri extrachromosomal
DNA by Southern blotting, which they attributed to
incomplete restriction due to variable restriction site modification in the DNA, and Ye et al. [27] reported protection
of an EcoRI site in the S. citri 16S rDNA. Moreover, differential methylation of restriction sites in the RF of the
spiroplasma virus, SVTS2, allowed Sha et al. [28] to clone
the full-length DNA.

S. citri BR3-3X showed probe-reactive sequences in both
the chromosomal and extrachromosomal DNA fractions.
However, that the patterns of hybridization of the two
fractions differed significantly from each other demonstrates that the two fractions of BR3-3X DNA were not
appreciably cross-contaminated. Sequence analyses of
DNA from the two fractions showed that, in BR3-3X, arp1
resides on pBJS-O and arp2 on the chromosome. Hybridization of S. citri ASP-1 and R8A2 plasmid preparations
with the pBJS-O probe (Fig. 3B), but not with the arp1
probe (Fig. 3A), indicates that each of these two strains
contained a plasmid related to pBJS-O, which differed
from pBJS-O in lacking arp1. Although S. citri ASP-1 and
R8A2 were originally derived from the same parent strain,
both have undergone extensive cultivation in vitro since
their first isolation, which may have contributed to the
differences between their plasmids and pBJS-O. Moreover, the differences in the maintenance regimes of the various spiroplasmas tested may have contributed to the
evolution of their plasmids. In this paper we could not
correlate pBJS-O and pBJS-O like sequences with either
transmissibility or phytopathogenicity of the spiroplasmas tested. However, it is still hypothesized that SARP1 is
involved in S. citri transmission by the insect vector.
Frequent chromosomal rearrangements such as inversions and deletions, leading to genome instability, have
been reported in spiroplasmas, such as in the lines derived

from S. citri strain BR3 [[29] and [30]]. In the present
study, we detected a 0.4 kbp deletion in pBJS-T relative to
pBJS-O. Unlike BR3-3X, which was stored frozen, S. citri
BR3-T was maintained for several years in turnip plants
via transmission by the natural insect vector C. tenellus,
possibly leading to the sequence differences between
pBJS-T and pBJS-O. A recombinational chromosomal
rearrangement is indicated by the 5'-sequence differences
between arp1 and arp2 reported above.
Recombination likely also played a role in the generation
of pBJS-O like plasmids. The gene organization on pBJSO is similar to that of the recently characterized IncP-like
S. kunkelii CR2-3X plasmid, pSKU146. Yet, the two plasmids have substantially different sequences in the region
including the soj-like gene in both plasmids and the IncP
oriT sequence in pSKU146. Highly similar sequences in
the remainder of the two plasmids suggest that recombination events have occurred during the generation of one
or both plasmids.
Phage sequences have been implicated in many recombination events in spiroplasmas. Only a short region with
similarity to a phage gene was found in pBJS-O. However,
the observation of strong stops to sequencing reactions in
the region of nucleotides 1 to 80 is reminiscent of a strong
stop encountered during the sequencing of the SVTS2
phage [31]. This strong stop was attributed to potential
secondary structure putatively involved in phage packaging. It is, thus, possible that pBJS-O has some phage-like
properties.
pBJS-O genes
As mentioned above, ORF3, encoding SARP1, and adjacent ORFs [GenBank:AJ297706], had been cloned and
characterized from S. citri BR3-T [15]. ORF3 was flanked
downstream by a partial ORF (ORF4) having no known
homologs. Upstream, ORF3 was flanked by ORF2, encoding a hypothetical protein with no similarity to any

known protein, and ORF1, a partial ORF encoding a putative homolog of a ParA-like protein, Soj, which oscillates
from pole to pole [32] and is important for chromosome
partitioning in Bacillus subtilis [33]. In this study, the putative protein product of orf4 was predicted to contain eight
transmembrane helices. Due to a 0.4 kb deletion in the
derivation of pBJS-T, orf4 is possibly a part of the same
transcription unit as arp1 and traE in this strain. In BR33X, arp1 and orf4 are separated by 281 bp, suggesting that
they are transcribed separately. Consistent with different
translational constraints on this region in BR3-T and BR33X, this region contains a large proportion of the differences between the lines. The translation start site of traE
was predicted to be ten nucleotides upstream of the orf4
translation stop site.
Consistent with the observation of Bai et al. [22], putative
products of the other pBJS-O ORFs, traE [34] and mob
[35], are homologous to proteins that are components of
the bacterial type IV secretion system involved in conjugative DNA transfer. Members of the TraE family of proteins
are thought to form pili that, in addition to conjugation,
are involved in processes like virus infection and biofilm
formation. Bai et al. [22] reported the presence of three
conserved transmembrane helices in four TraE homologs
that they characterized from S. kunkelii M2. Ozbek et al.
[36], in their transmission electron micrographs, reported
the presence of structures resembling fimbriae and pili in
S. kunkelii and Bai et al. [22] considered whether the structures may be involved in conjugation. Bové [37] reported
that rod-shaped spiroplasma viruses, approximately 230–
280 by 10–15 µm in size, can also be surface-associated.
Because they can attach perpendicularly to the host membrane at their tips [[38] and [39]], they might resemble the
structures reported as pili/fimbriae. In the putative TraE
homolog reported here, unlike its S. kunkelii counterpart,
two transmembrane helices were predicted at high probability and a third one at moderate probability. Should the
third not actually be a transmembrane helix, the ATP

binding site would be located intracellularly rather than
extracellularly.
pBJS-O gene organization and evolution
Unlike pSKU146, pBJS-O was found to lack the conserved
oriT region characteristic of the IncP group of plasmids.
We were also unable to identify a region in pBJS-O resembling any other known plasmid origins of transfer, suggesting that pBJS-O belongs to a hitherto unidentified
group of plasmids. Horizontal transfer of a promiscuous
plasmid, such as an IncP plasmid, between phylogenetically related and unrelated bacteria would help the hosts
quickly adapt to different niches [40]. It is possible that an
IncP-like plasmid was acquired by the ancestor of S. citri
and S. kunkelii. The plasmid may have co-evolved with the
host chromosomes after the divergence of the two species,
leading to the emergence of pBJS-O and pSKU146, respectively, and to the adaptation of the pathogens to phylogenetically distinct leafhopper vectors and plant hosts.
Future directions
Molecular genetic tools such as cloning and transposonmediated mutagenesis are available for the study of mollicutes [41]. Cloned genes were expressed in S. citri GII-3
using artificial plasmids based on the S. citri chromosomal oriC [[42,43] and [44]]. However, those plasmids
tend to integrate into the S. citri chromosome. When

pCJ32, a derivative of the oriC plasmid pBOT1, containing
an internal fragment of the gene scm1 (a motility-related
S. citri gene), was transformed into S. citri GII-3 cells it
successfully integrated into the host chromosome by
homologous recombination and disrupted scm1, resulting
in non-motile S. citri GII-3 mutants [45]. However,
attempts to use pBOT1 in S. citri BR3-3X have been unsuccessful (F. Ye, unpublished data), possibly due to the
incompatibility of the plasmid with the host. The indigenous S. citri BR-3X plasmid, pBJS-O, will help us develop
a better vector for genetic manipulation not only in S. citri
BR3-3X but also in other spiroplasmas.

Conclusion
We have shown that the S. citri BR3-3X plasmid, pBJS-O,
encodes the putative adhesin SARP1. This is the first
report of an S. citri plasmid encoding a putative adhesin.
We have further shown that the arp1-like gene, arp2,
resides on the BR3-3X chromosome. The indigenous S.
citri BR3-3X plasmid, pBJS-O, will be useful for the development of a better vector for genetic manipulation not
only in S. citri BR3-3X but also in other spiroplasmas. Our
data also suggest that pBJS-O is a novel S. citri plasmid
that does not belong to any known plasmid incompatibility group. The differences between pBJS-O and pSKU146
suggest that recombination has contributed to the divergence of the two plasmids.

Methods
Spiroplasmas
S. citri BR3 was isolated from horseradish plants with brittle root disease [7]. S. citri BR3-T, derived from the triply
cloned parental isolate (BR3-3X) by repeated transmission in turnips via its insect vector C. tenellus, is insecttransmissible. BR3-M, derived by passage in liquid
medium 43 times, is also a transmissible line. The lines
BR3-G (maintained in periwinkle plants by graft transmission) and BR3-P (passed in liquid medium more than 130
times) are insect non-transmissible [46]. S. citri R8A2, isolated from citrus in Morocco [47], and its non-helical
derivative ASP-1 (both obtained from R.E. Davis, USDA/
ARS, Beltsville, MD), are non-transmissible. Also provided by R.E. Davis were S. citri Beni Mellal, originally isolated from C. hematoceps collected in Morocco; S.
melliferum TS2, isolated from honeybees and S. floricola
23-6, isolated from a flower surface [48]. S. phoeniceum
P40, a gift from G. Gasparich (Towson University, Towson, MD), was originally isolated from periwinkle in Syria
[11]. S. kunkelii CR2-3X was isolated by one of us (J.
Fletcher) from stunt-diseased corn collected in Costa Rica
[49]. All spiroplasmas, except S. kunkelii CR2-3X, were
grown in LD8 broth medium [50] at 31°C. The latter was
grown in LD8A3 broth medium [51] at 28°C.
Purification of chromosomal and extrachromosomal ds
DNAs from spiroplasmas
For Southern blot hybridization and PCR, extrachromosomal double-stranded (ds) DNA of spiroplasma strains
was isolated using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep and the
QIAGEN Plasmid Mini Kits (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA),
following the manufacturer's protocols. For primer walking, S. citri BR3-3X extrachromosomal DNA was isolated
using a previously published procedure [28]. The isolation of chromosomal DNA from S. citri BR3-3X cells was
performed according to Murray and Thompson [52] and
using 1.4 M NaCl, 2.5% cetyltrimethylammonium bromide [CTAB], 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 20 mM
EDTA in the extraction buffer.
PCR and sequencing using S. citri BR3-3X plasmid and
chromosomal DNAs
To amplify the 3'- and flanking regions of arp genes from
S. citri BR3-3X plasmid and chromosomal DNAs, two oligonucleotides were designed, forward (#7686) 5'AACACTATTTTCACTGCGG-3', from the S. citri BR3-T
arp1 sequence (GenBank accession number AJ297706),
and reverse (#7960) 5'-TTTTCCATTGTTTTTGTCTCC-3',
from the sequence homologous to ORF4 from the plasmid pSKU146 (pSKU146_11; accession number
NC_006400). The PCR was carried out in a DNA thermal
cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA) performing 35 cycles,
each of 30 sec at 94°C, 1 min at 42°C and 3 min at 72°C.
Reactions were performed separately in a volume of 50 µl

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/175

containing 2.5 Units Taq polymerase (Promega), 0.20 µM
primers, 200 µM of each dNTP, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 100–
150 ng BR3-3X plasmid and ~ 3.5 µg chromosomal DNA.
The amplicons were sequenced using ~ 100 ng of each of
the PCR products, 10 µM of the same primers used in the
PCR in separate reactions by the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing method (version 1.0, Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with an ABI PRISM 3700
Automated DNA Analyzer (Perkin Elmer Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Southern blotting
Extrachromosomal DNA of each spiroplasma strain was
digested with EcoRI (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 4 h at
37°C. The fragments were separated by electrophoresis on
a 0.75% (w/v) agarose gel in 1× TAE running buffer and
transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham
Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) according to standard procedures. The blots were subsequently hybridized to Dig11-UTP-labeled arp1-derived and whole-plasmid probes,
labeled using a DIG DNA Labeling Kit (Roche Molecular
Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), following the manufacturer's instructions. The arp1-derived probe was obtained
by PCR, using clone pP89B (an RsaI fragment of S. citri
BR3-T genomic DNA; [15]) as template, and primer pair
T7 and #7483 (5'-TTTAACATCAACCGAACCC-3'). The
probe comprised 657 bp of a DNA segment from S. citri
BR3-T (AJ297706; positions 2315–2989) and 72 bp
derived from the cloning vector (pBluescript). PCR was
carried out in a DNA thermal cycler performing 34 cycles,
each of 30 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at 54°C and 1 min at 72°C.
Reactions were performed in a volume of 50 µl containing
1 Unit Taq polymerase, 0.25 µM primers, 250 µM of each
dNTP, 50 – 100 ng template DNA, and 2.5 mM MgCl2.
Hybridizations were performed at 55°C in Church buffer
(0.5 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, and 1
mM EDTA) overnight followed by four washes, each of 20
min, at 55°C in washing buffer (40 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.1% SDS). Detection of
the DIG-labeled probes was performed using a DIG Luminescent Detection Kit (Roche) following the manufacturer's protocol.
Complete nucleotide sequencing of pBJS-O
The sequence AJ297706 was used to design primers to initiate primer walking to completely sequence and characterize the unknown portion of pBJS-O. The sequencing
reactions were performed using ~ 1.2 µg of pBJS-O DNA
and 40 µM of primers with the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing method and the ABI PRISM 3700
Automated DNA Analyzer, as mentioned above. The total
134 sequence reads with an average length of 600 bases
gave us about 6× coverage of the entire plasmid sequence.
The fragments were assembled from the trace files using
the software package PipeOnline 2.0 [53]. Physical gaps in

the sequence were closed by PCR and cloning of the products into vector pGEM-T (Promega). The clones were
sequenced using primers T7 and SP6. The consensus
sequence of the final assembly was annotated using the
BLASTX search program [54] and the ORF Finder tool at
NCBI, in which a minimum length of 100 bases was used
for the nucleotide sequence of a putative ORF. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence analysis tools offered by
the Biology Workbench at the San Diego Supercomputer
Center, such as ClustalW and PHYLIP for generating the
unrooted phylogenetic tree of the S. citri arp sequences,
were used to further analyze the plasmid and the polypeptide sequences. BLASTN and BLASTP searches were carried
out to find out relationships with the closest homologs. S.
kunkelii CR2-3X genome sequence data were accessed and
BLAST searches were performed at the Spiroplasma
Genome Sequencing Project Web site mentioned above.
