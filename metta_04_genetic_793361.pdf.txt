Abstract
Background: Molecular characterization of cattle breeds is important for the prevention of
germplasm erosion by cross breeding. The Indian zebu cattle have their significant role in evolution
of present day cattle breeds and development of some of the exotic breeds. Microsatellites are the
best available molecular tools for characterization of cattle breeds. The present study was carried
out to characterize two Indian cattle breeds, Ongole and Deoni, using microsatellite markers.
Results: Using 5 di- and 5 tri-nucleotide repeat loci, 17 Ongole and 13 Deoni unrelated individuals
were studied. Of the ten loci, eight revealed polymorphism in both the breeds. The di-nucleotide
repeat loci were found to be more polymorphic (100%) than tri-nucleotide repeat loci (60%). A
total of 39 polymorphic alleles were obtained at 4.5 alleles per locus in Ongole and 4.1 in Deoni.
The average expected heterozygosity was 0.46 (±0.1) and 0.50 (±0.1) in Ongole and Deoni breeds,
respectively. The PIC values of the polymorphic loci ranged from 0.15 to 0.79 in Ongole and 0.13
to 0.80 in Deoni breeds. Six Ongole specific and three Deoni specific alleles were identified. The
two breeds showed a moderate genetic relationship between themselves with a FST value of 0.117
(P = 0.01).
Conclusions: This preliminary study shows that microsatellite markers are useful in distinguishing
the two zebu breeds namely, Ongole and Deoni. Further studies of other zebu breeds using many
microsatellite loci with larger sample sizes can reveal the genetic relationships of Indian breeds.

Background
The Indian cattle breeds, also known as zebu cattle (Bos
indicus) are broadly categorized into dairy, draft and dual
purpose breeds depending upon their utility either in
dairying or in agricultural work. The dual-purpose breeds
have specific qualities like disease resistance, heat tolerance, ability to survive and reproduce under stress and low

feed input. Ongole and Deoni are the dual-purpose
breeds from the Southern part of India. Ongole breed contributed to the development of some of the exotic breeds
like 'American Brahman', 'Santa Getrudis' etc. [1] and is
used extensively for beef production in Latin American
countries [2]. Deoni is yet another breed serving the needs
of the people in semi-arid hilly areas. Short calving

interval, massive body and fairly well developed udder in
cows of this breed indicate its dual-purpose nature.
Zebu cattle are used in cross breeding programs as they can
adapt to hot and humid climates [3,4]. However, a
number of these breeds are now being bred out because of
intensive cross breeding with high milk producing exotic
breeds and reduction of emphasis on draft ability due to
mechanization of agriculture and transport. As a result,
some of the native draft breeds are on the verge of extinction. Hence, there is an urgent need to conserve these
breeds. Breed characterization is the primary step in any
conservation programme. The accuracy of phenotypic
characterization of domestic cattle is often affected by the
influence of the environment and the underlying genetic
complexity. A number of studies have been initiated to
characterize the European cattle breeds using the molecular tools like microsatellite markers [5-9]. Microsatellite
markers, by virtue of their codominant and multiallelic
nature prove to be efficient in genetic diversity studies,
pedigree evaluation and genetic mapping as compared to
other molecular markers like RAPD, RFLP and ISSRs [10].
Microsatellites have become markers of choice in characterization of cattle breeds [8,11-13]. Many studies have
indicated that the deepest roots of cattle phylogeny occur
between Indian cattle and those of Europe [14]. In spite of
the evolutionary significance of the Indian cattle breeds,
the available literature on characterization of these breeds
using reliable molecular markers is scanty. Recently,
Kumar et al. [15] carried out admixture analysis of South
Asian cattle breeds revealing the influence of Bos taurus in
the Indian sub-continent. In the present study, we undertook the characterization of Ongole (n = 17) and Deoni (n
= 13) cattle breeds using 5 di- and 5 tri-nucleotide repeat
microsatellite markers. The two breeds showed a moderate genetic relationship (FST = 0.117). A few breed-distinguishing alleles were identified, which can be used to
differentiate the two breeds.

Results and Discussion
In the present study, genetic polymorphism in the two cattle breeds, Ongole and Deoni were analyzed by using 10
microsatellite markers, which were known to be polymorphic in taurine populations [16-19]. Eight microsatellite
markers showed polymorphism while the remaining two
markers ARO23 and PZE46 were monomorphic in both
the breeds. The polymorphic loci gave a total of 39 alleles
in both the breeds, with an average of 4.5 and 4.1 alleles
per locus in Ongole and Deoni breeds, respectively. The
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) suggests that
five different alleles per locus are required for estimation
of genetic differences between breeds. The mean number
of alleles in the present study is almost in accordance with
the FAO recommendations. The monomorphic locus
ARO23 showed allele size deviation in both the breeds

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/5/16

when compared to the published data from the other
exotic breeds [16]. Four alleles were reported for this locus
with sizes ranging from 96 bp to 105 bp in International
Bovine Reference Panel (IBRP) full-sib families. However,
in the present study, the same locus revealed a monomorphic allele of 78 bp in both the breeds. If this could turn
out to be a zebu specific allele, it would be very useful.
However, this could be only confirmed by studies involving other 24 recognized Indian zebu breeds.
There appears to be no correlation between the number of
alleles detected and the number of SSR repeats in the SSR
loci used in the study. For example, the microsatellite loci
containing the 'GT' repeat motifs varying from (GT)17 to
(GT)22 did not show any correlation with the number of
alleles they revealed. However, the di-nucleotide repeat
loci were more polymorphic (100%) than the tri-nucleotide repeat loci (60%). The two monomorphic loci used
in the present study (ARO23 and PZE46) are tri-nucleotide repeat loci. Three alleles specific to Deoni and six
alleles specific to Ongole were observed with frequencies
ranging from 3 to 24% (Table 1). Further, some alleles
were more frequent in one breed than the other (Fig. 1).
However, the breed specificity should be confirmed by
analysing a large set of individuals from these breeds and
also other zebu breeds.
The genetic diversity in the breeds was expressed in terms
of average heterozygosity. The average expected heterozygosity was 0.46 (±0.1) in Ongole breed and 0.50 (±0.1) in
Deoni breed. Informativeness of the marker was expressed
as Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) [20]. The
PIC of the polymorphic loci ranged from 0.15 to 0.79 in
Ongole breed and 0.13 to 0.80 in Deoni breed (Table 2).
The FIS value, which indicates within breed genetic variation, for Ongole and Deoni breeds was 0.36 and 0.18,
respectively. This suggests that our sample represented
individuals of inbred population of Ongole compared to
Deoni. This could also be due to the small sample size and
some of the individuals considered as unrelated during
collection may indeed share common parentage in the
history beyond known pedigree. This is exactly the advantage of using molecular markers in revealing the actual
genetic relationships. The overall genetic divergence
between Ongole and Deoni, FST was 0.117, which was significant (P = 0.01). This falls in the range of moderate
genetic differentiation on a scale defined by Wright [21].

Conclusions
The present study is a preliminary investigation on the
application of SSR markers for the analysis of diversity
and genetic relationships between zebu breeds. It also
evaluates the polymorphism using di- and tri-nucleotide
repeats in two zebu breeds. We observed a difference in
inbreeding in the two breeds, with Deoni breed having

that the dinucleotide repeat SSRs are more polymorphic
than tri-nucleotide repeats. Further studies involving large
samples including samples from other zebu breeds with
FAO recommended microsatellite loci are required to
understand the genetic relationships among the Indian
breeds.

Methods

PZE46

Blood samples and DNA isolation
Blood samples were collected from 17 Ongole and 13
Deoni breed individuals maintained at two different livestock research stations managed by the A N G R Agricultural University, Hyderabad, India, in 3 ml Sodium-EDTA
vacutainers. The Ongole breed individuals were tracked
for 5 generations and Deoni breed for 2 generations to
obtain the pedigree and select the individuals that are
unrelated. These animals were produced by artificial
insemination.

The genomic DNA was isolated and assessed for purity
following standard molecular biology protocols [22].
Microsatellite analysis
Five di-nucleotide markers, BMS1716, BMS2057,
BMS2270, BMS2840 and BMS2847 [17] and five trinucleotide markers, ARO23, ARO62 and ARO85 [16];
BtDIAS1 [18] and PZE46 [19] were employed in the
present study. For the loci ARO62, BtDIAS1 and PZE46,
primers were designed using the Amplify 1.2 program
[23] as,

For the rest, primer sequence information was obtained
from GenBank [24].
PCR conditions were empirically determined (Table 2).
Twenty nanograms of genomic DNA was used as template
in a 10 µl PCR reaction consisting of 5 picomoles of each
primers, 1 to 1.5 mM MgCl2 (MBI Fermentas), 1 µl of 10
× PCR buffer (750 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8 at 25°C), 200
mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.1% Tween-20), 100 µM dNTPs, 0.5 U
Taq polymerase (MBI Fermentas), in Genamp 9600™ thermalcycler (Perkin Elmer). The PCR cycling conditions
used were: 96°C for 1 min. (Initial Denaturation), 94°C
for 30 sec. (Denaturation), 49°C–58°C for 30 sec.
(Annealing), 72°C for 1 min 30 sec. (Extension) and
72°C for 10 min. (Final extension). The PCR samples
were electrophoresed on 3.5% Metaphor™ agarose (BMN)
gel with 1 kb plus (Invitrogen) and pUC19 DNA/MspI
marker (MBI Fermentas) DNA size markers. To confirm
the number of alleles and to determine the allele size, Fluorescence based SSR analysis [25] was carried out. Denatured amplified samples were separated on a 5%

denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M Urea after
adding 2 µl of formamide gel loading buffer and 0.3 µl of
ROX-500™ Genescan ruler (Perkin Elmer).
Data analysis
The allele size variation on the Metaphor Agarose gels was
studied using Quantity One software (Bio Rad). The
Genescan gels were analyzed using GeneScan 3.1 and
Genotyper 2.1 software. The individuals are genotyped
based on allele size data. Allele frequency and heterozygosity were calculated using MS Tools v3 [26]. F-statistics
were used as a measure of diversity within and between
breeds respectively and were estimated using the F-STAT
program [27].

The PIC was calculated by using the formula [20]:
