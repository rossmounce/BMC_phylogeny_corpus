Background
We propose a Petri Net-based method for metabolic networks profiling with respect to specific environmental
conditions, based on the concept of metabolic reactions
hierarchical ordering considered in [1]. One or more
metabolites are seeded in the network, then the newly
synthesized compounds are iteratively integrated in the
system until no new compounds could be synthesized,
breeding a process of metabolic network expansion. At
each step t of the network expansional process the method
identifies the subset of metabolites s(t), also called
"scope", that could be synthesized from the compounds
available in the step t-1. The size |s(t)| of each set s(t)
could be used to derive absolute and relative expansion
process profiles, describing both the total number of compounds progressively incorporated and the number of
new compounds synthesized in each algorithm step t.

set reaches a saturation, since unavailable factors are
required for the synthesis of novel compounds.

Results
The absolute profiles of the expansion processes obtained

red blood cells, Escherichia coli, Mannheimia succiniciproducens, Helycobacter pylori, Saccaromyces cerevisiae and Staphyococcus aureus are depicted in Figure 1. The qualitative
trend is similar in all the metabolisms, with the exception
of red blood cells network. Profiles are characterized by a
rapid incorporation of compounds in the first iterations,
while in the terminal steps the size of the metabolite sub-

The relative profiles of the same expansion processes,
depicted in Figure 2, show the relevance of each algorithm
step, allowing the identification of those steps in which a
large number of compounds are synthesized. This is possible thanks to the incorporation of compounds called
"metabolic hubs".

Conclusion
Since natural selection acts on every structural entity of
life, as it has been proven from genomic and proteomic
sequences analyses, it is plausible to suppose that biological networks' structure is selected through evolution, and
we prospect phylogeny approaches based on networks
comparisons. In this direction the definition of a similarity metric between metabolisms based on the symmetric
version of the Kullback-Leibler distance among probability distributions, applied on the profiles obtained using
the method here proposed, is a promising research topic.
