Abstract
Background: The HIV virus is known for its ability to exploit numerous genetic and evolutionary
mechanisms to ensure its proliferation, among them, high replication, mutation and recombination
rates. Sliding MinPD, a recently introduced computational method [1], was used to investigate the
patterns of evolution of serially-sampled HIV-1 sequence data from eight patients with a special
focus on the emergence of X4 strains. Unlike other phylogenetic methods, Sliding MinPD combines
distance-based inference with a nonparametric bootstrap procedure and automated recombination
detection to reconstruct the evolutionary history of longitudinal sequence data. We present serial
evolutionary networks as a longitudinal representation of the mutational pathways of a viral
population in a within-host environment. The longitudinal representation of the evolutionary
networks was complemented with charts of clinical markers to facilitate correlation analysis
between pertinent clinical information and the evolutionary relationships.
Results: Analysis based on the predicted networks suggests the following:: significantly stronger
recombination signals (p = 0.003) for the inferred ancestors of the X4 strains, recombination
events between different lineages and recombination events between putative reservoir virus and
those from a later population, an early star-like topology observed for four of the patients who
died of AIDS. A significantly higher number of recombinants were predicted at sampling points that
corresponded to peaks in the viral load levels (p = 0.0042).
Conclusion: Our results indicate that serial evolutionary networks of HIV sequences enable
systematic statistical analysis of the implicit relations embedded in the topology of the structure
and can greatly facilitate identification of patterns of evolution that can lead to specific hypotheses
and new insights. The conclusions of applying our method to empirical HIV data support the
conventional wisdom of the new generation HIV treatments, that in order to keep the virus in
check, viral loads need to be suppressed to almost undetectable levels.

Background
One of the earliest and most striking observations made
about HIV was the extensive genetic variation that the
viral population exhibits within individual hosts, particu-

larly in the hypervariable regions of the env (envelope)
gene that code for the gp120 protein. Some of the remarkable properties of within-patient HIV quasispecies are
their large population size, high replication rate, and short

generation time. HIV has a high mutation rate (0.2 errors
per genome per cycle) and an even higher recombination
rate (3 events per genome per cycle) [2]. In North America, Western Europe, and Australia, the spread of HIV/
AIDS has slowed down due to the introduction of multiple prevention and treatment strategies; however, in
developing countries there are often not enough resources
to combat the epidemic [3]. During HIV-1 infection a
severe depletion in CD4+ T-Cells is characteristic of the
onset of AIDS. Several studies have also shown a direct
correlation between CD4+ decline and the proliferation
of X4 strains, which lead to multinucleated cells called
syncytia and to cell death [4]. Recent studies have shown
a switch to X4 strains in viral reservoirs during effective
highly active antiretroviral therapy [5]. The current study
investigated a possible link between recombination and
the emergence of the X4 strains.
Conventional phylogenetic programs are constrained to
produce simple branching trees that can lead to misinterpretations of the phylogenetic relationships if the data set
contains recombinants. One main assumption of most
phylogenetic methods is that there is only one phylogeny
underlying the evolution of the taxa under study. Recombination violates this assumption by generating mosaic
genes, where different regions have different phylogenetic
histories [6-8]. Furthermore, these traditional phylogenetic methods assume that all the sequence data are from
contemporaneous taxa, which is not valid for seriallysampled data from longitudinal studies. Several methods
that estimate the phylogenetic relationship of seriallysampled data have been published since 2000 [1,9-14].
However, only one of these methods takes recombination
into account: Sliding MinPD [1]. The recombination process in HIV uses the mechanism of copy-choice replication,
in which the viral polymerase switches between different
RNA templates during transcription to give rise to mosaic
genomes [15]. Mosaic genomes and genes can be identified through a computational sliding window method
like the one implemented in Sliding MinPD. Sliding
MinPD, the computational tool used in the current study,
offers a choice of three different recombination detection
methods (based on pairwise distances or topology comparisons) and calculates the statistical significance of the
predictions (in terms of nonparametric bootstrap values)
to infer the evolutionary history of a set of serially-sampled DNA or RNA sequences [1,16]. A recent study concluded that the variability found in a within-patient HIV
population is due to a high incidence of recombination
events [17]. Other studies have looked at the pervasive
evolutionary force of HIV-1 recombination in vivo [18]
and its effect on the emergence of drug-resistance [19,20].
A better understanding of the dynamics of HIV recombination is vital to the development of more complete mod-

els of HIV evolution that explain the escape of the virus
from adaptive immunity and antiviral therapies.
In 1999, a comprehensive study of in vivo HIV evolution
was published [21]. The study performed phylogenetic
and statistical analysis on viral sequence data from the env
gene collected at recurring time intervals from nine
patients over a span of 8 to 12 years. The study provided
new insights [21], but did not look at the effects that
recombination has on the in vivo evolution of HIV. Henceforth we will refer to the HIV data set as the
Shankarappa99 data set. We used Sliding MinPD to analyze the Shankarappa99 data set using data for eight of the
nine patients for which hand-curated alignments were
made available.
In this paper, we explore the discovery power of our computational tool by taking a closer look at the generated
serial evolutionary networks. We present eight evolutionary networks obtained by applying Sliding MinPD to the
Shankarappa99 data set and describe how the network
information facilitates the study of viral evolutionary relationships, evolutionary patterns, splitting and merging of
lineages, and how it helps to determine how these correlate with the disease status of the patient. Our analysis
provides insight into within-host viral evolution and
helps to find patterns that may explain the emergence of
harmful mutants associated with disease progression.

Methods
Serial Evolutionary Networks
In a 1992 study, Holmes et al. created an "evolutionary
framework" to express the inferred ancestor-descendent
relationships in HIV sequence data that was serially sampled from a single patient [22]. The authors stated that
"unlike most molecular phylogenies, real ancestors may
be present in the data and the framework expresses the
postulated ancestor-descendent relationships". Sliding
MinPD, which is based on the above assumption, was
used to construct "evolutionary networks" of 8 patients
from the Shankarappa99 data set. Sliding MinPD combines a minimum pairwise distance (MinPD) approach, a
sliding window method, and automated recombination
detection to study the ancestor-descendant relationships
of serially-sampled nucleotide sequences. In Sliding
MinPD the identification of recombinants, ancestors and
breakpoints is automated with no need for user intervention. It uses non-parametric bootstrap to measure the statistical support of its predictions. Three recombination
detection options are available in Sliding MinPD (RIP, SB,
and B-RIP) and have been previously described [1,16].
Briefly, Sliding MinPD takes as input a set of time-dated
aligned sequences. The nucleotide columns in the alignment are bootstrapped into x replicates using a method in
which some columns are included one or more times and

others are omitted. The corrected distance matrix is calculated for the x replicates. The process is repeated using a
sliding window approach that captures overlapping intervals of contiguous columns in the alignment. A recombinant sequence is identified when for different windows
in the alignment different sequences are identified as
ancestors with high bootstrap support. The method for
recombinant identification varies slightly between RIP, SB
and B-RIP. For the Standard Bootscan method (SB), for
example, phylogenetic NJ trees are inferred and the topological distance between ancestor and descendant
sequences is computed. Finally, NJ trees are constructed
for all sets of sequences that share the same ancestors.
Sequences identified as recombinants have two or more
predicted ancestors and are included in two or more different NJ trees. More information can be found at the program's web site: http://biorg.cis.fiu.edu/SlidingMinPD
Data sets
The Shankarappa99 data set is available for download
from GenBank and the HIV Los Alamos database. It consists of viral DNA and plasma RNA sequences from the
C2-V5 region of the env gene sampled serially from
patients with a moderate or slow rate of disease progression. All PCR amplifications were done with procedural
safeguards to prevent recombination from occurring during PCR [21]. Two hand-aligned versions of the data set
for 8 of the 9 patients were downloaded from the URL:
http://www.cebl.auckland.ac.nz/~hros001/HIVpossel/,
where it is available as supplementary material for a study
on immune-mediated positive selection driven by HIV-1
molecular variation [23]. Both versions were available in
the PAUP Nexus format and were separated into subsets,
each corresponding to a single patient. One version was a
gapped, hand-aligned file of the entire Shankarappa99
data set, where gaps signified insertions or deletions [23].
The length of the sequences was 786 nucleotides. The second data set contained a gap-balanced alignment of each
of the subsets of the same data. Gaps had been removed
from this data set in a "balanced" manner, i.e., such that
codon alignments were preserved. Both the data sets,
gapped and gap-balanced, had been aligned against reference HIV sequences (HIV-1 type B accession numbers
K03455, M17451, U63632, and U21135) from the Los
Alamos database. The sampled sequences correspond to
amino acid positions 267 to 472 of the env gene of the reference sequences. The data sets of the 8 patients were then
analyzed using Sliding MinPD. Duplicate sequences from
the same sampling point were removed as they represented the same ancestral sequence, retaining just one
copy, but marked with an x followed by the number of
duplicate copies. Thus, the sequence labeled "11 × 2"
from Figure 1 refers to two copies of sequence 11 from the
sampling time point 20.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/62

The sequences in the Shankarappa99 data set from the
same time point had a relatively low level of diversity
(average genetic distance: 0.03) and a low level of divergence relative to an initial founder sequence from the first
sampling period (average genetic distance: 0.05). The
exceptions were the data sets for patient 9 at all sampling
points, and the sequences for patients 2, 3, and 7 for the
last sampling times [21]. Low divergence causes a drop in
performance in most recombination detection methods
[24] and as described below we adjusted Sliding MinPD's
settings to counteract those effects. Previous simulation
studies and ROC curve analyses showed a recombination
prediction performance of >0.9 for the bootstrap methods
SB and B-RIP. Our simulation studies also showed a
decrease in sensitivity for data with low divergence; however, the mean specificity remained above 0.97. The
method proposed here is based on identifying the recombinant predictions which are supported by the three
methods. We therefore trade in sensitivity for a high specificity value because a high confidence recombination
prediction is desirable for visual analysis purposes and
because sequences with some but not high enough recombination support will still be linked to one of the ancestral
donor sequences.
We provided the alignment files, two for each patient, as
input to Sliding MinPD, which ran each file using the
three different recombination detection options: B-RIP
(Bootscan RIP), SB (standard Bootscan) and RIP, producing 6 result files for each patient. In a final step, a consensus file was manually created by combining information
from the 6 result files using a consensus strategy and a
keen awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of the
three methods used [1].
Program Settings and Consensus Network
The settings for each option of the program were the same
as the default options presented previously [1], with the
exception of the RIP program, which was executed with a
window size of 200 and a step size of 50, to compensate
for the low divergence rates in the data sets. The default
settings were as follows – window size = 200, step size =
20, bootstrap replicates = 100, bootstrap threshold = 90,
PCC = 0.2 (for SB) and 0.4 (for RIP and B-RIP), corrected
distance = TN93, rate heterogeneity alpha shape parameter = 0.5, and a bound of 1 for the number of crossovers.
The results for non-recombinant predictions were less
compromised given that MinPD (the predecessor of Sliding MinPD's RIP option) has been proven to perform well
for non-recombinant data with low mutation rates [25].

A consensus file of ancestor descendant relationships was
created manually from the 6 result files by applying the
following guidelines in sequential order (if a rule was not
applicable, the next applicable rule was chosen):

Page 3 of 17

BMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:62

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/62

▪ Majority rule: The relationship chosen by a majority
(at least four) of the six methods was chosen as the
consensus.

▪ X4-mutants appear in red and are also marked with a
top-right elevated small x, as in the taxon 10(79)x from
Figure 1 at 68 months.

▪ Consensus by bootstrap support: The result with the
highest bootstrap value was chosen.

▪ An equal sign "=" next to a node indicates that the
sequence is identical to an ancestral sequence from a
previous sampling period. For example, the sequence
18(100) of patient 2 at 91 months is identical to
sequence 18(82) from the 80 months sampling
period.

Consensus by priority: The results using the B-RIP option
were given highest priority because of its superior performance and because it outputs the statistical bootstrap
support for each estimate [1]. The results by SB had the
second highest priority when choosing recombinant relationships. When all options agreed on a non-recombinant
relationship, RIP was given the second highest priority for
the ancestor choice. The results for the gap-balanced data
were given secondary consideration for recombinant
events, as the length of the alignment was often different
from that of the gapped alignment and breakpoint positions could not be easily matched.
A serial evolutionary network was constructed for each of
the 8 patients from the consensus file containing the
ancestor-descendant relationships. A short summary of
the guidelines used for interpreting the networks is given
below:
▪ The sampling times in units of "months" from the
time of seroconversion are shown at the top of each
network. Thus, all sequences from the same sampling
time are aligned vertically under the corresponding
time.
▪ Full lines indicate branch lengths. Thus longer full
lines indicate greater evolutionary distance. Dotted
lines indicate linking relationships. Finally, dashed
blue lines indicate recombination-linking relationships between donors and recombinants.
▪ Recombinant sequences are underlined in blue.
▪ Breakpoint positions appear after a slash at the point
were the lines intersect. If the left donor is at the top
(bottom, respectively) end of the recombination-linking dashed line, this is indicated by a forward (backward, respectively) slash followed by the breakpoint
position. To locate a breakpoint position along the
C2-C5 region of the env gene, it is necessary to know
the coordinates of the gapped sequences with regards
to the env gene map. The approximate start coordinates {within env gene| within HIV genome} of the
env regions covered by the sequences are: pos 1 –
C2:{799|7023}, pos 98 – V3:{891|7115}, pos 254 –
C3:{995|7219}, pos 443 – V4: {1150|7374}, pos 579
– C4:{1243|7467}, pos 712 – V5:{1367|7591}, pos
772 – C5:{1403|7627}.

▪ Statistical bootstrap support values, which provide
statistical significance scores for the ancestor-descendant predictions are interpreted as follows:
‫ ؠ‬The bootstrap values are added in parenthesis
after the sequence ID.
‫ ؠ‬The bootstrap values correspond to the ancestordescendant relationship and not to the clades or
topological position in the subtrees. The bootstrap
value represents the support given to the choice of
linking a specific query sequence to the ancestor at
the root of the immediate subtree. Thus, the taxon
labeled 43(97) at 61 months in Figure 1 corresponds to a bootstrap value of 97 for the ancestordescendant relationship to taxon 08 at 40 months.
‫ ؠ‬Bootstrap values of recombinant sequences were
obtained from computations involving only a few
sequences from the pool of donor candidates.
‫ ؠ‬Unlike the bootstrap values of recombinant
sequences, the bootstrap values of non-recombinant sequences were calculated by using all
sequences up to the previous sampling point of the
query sequence.
The sequence IDs have been shortened to decrease the
amount of clutter and to make space for the bootstrap values. In their shortened form, they are unique within a
sampling point, but not across the whole serial evolutionary network. For example, the GenBank ID of p2c005-03
is shortened as 03 in the network of patient 2 under the
sampling time 5 months

Results
Evolutionary networks for three of the eight patients who
survived after the end of the analysis were discussed in
detail. The statistical analysis section below discusses
results based on all eight data sets and networks. In a previous study [14], the network of patient 2 (labeled as
patient S in that study), was constructed using the MinPD
method from that paper. In this paper, the serial evolutionary networks, which were produced by the improved

method, Sliding MinPD, are presented. A mixture of the
Genbank notation described above and the notation
shown in the networks is used to refer to the patient's
sequences: a sequence from patient 2 (Figure 1) defined
by 12 m-10(83) appears as 10(83) under the 12 months
column. The information about the health status of the
patients, the therapy administered to each, viral loads and
CD4+ T-cell counts were obtained from a previous study
[21]. In addition to the serial evolutionary network,
whose representation is described in detail in the previous
section, each patient network is accompanied by a chart at
the bottom displaying clinical markers (T-cell counts,
viral loads), evolutionary markers (proportion of recombinants) and genetic markers (proportion of X4
sequences). Underneath the chart, the duration of drug
therapy administration and the kinds of drugs that were
prescribed are shown as horizontal bands under the time
axis. The placement of this information under the serial
evolutionary networks facilitates the visual discovery of
patterns and associations between the different factors
affecting the within-patient evolution of HIV.
Patient 2
The Sliding MinPD analysis resulted in the following
inferences and observations: Three different lineages were
inferred up to the 30-months sampling time point. At that
point, the lineage of 5 m-03 (with a 5 months start)
became extinct. At 51 months the 5 m-09 lineage ceased
to exist with sequence 51 m-25(97) as its last sampled
sequence. Of more relevance is the splitting of the 5 m-11
lineage into several lineages, with strain 20 m-17(47)
inferred as an early ancestor of the large X4 population
that emerged after the 51 months period. All other arms
of the 5 m-11 lineage disappeared within 68 months with
the last sampled representative being 68 m-14(76). The
evolutionary network made it convenient to understand
how widespread the X4 genotype is in each sampling
period. In particular, the most recent common ancestor of
all post-61-months sequences carrying the X4 mutation
was identified as 51 m-91(93), a recombinant sequence.
The network suggests an increase in recombination activity in the last sampling period, which coincided with a
decrease in the number of CD4+ T-cells and the start of the
antiretroviral drug therapy at the 103rd month period.
The patient took three different drugs that included Zidovudine (ZDV), between 97 and 120 months, dideoxycytidine (ddC), between 109 and 125 months, and Stavudine
(d4T), after 114 months. An interesting recombination
event was suggested for sequence 126 m-19(93) with a
putative left-side donor of 68 m-19(83), which was sampled almost 5 years earlier (a possible reservoir virus), and
which was from a different lineage that did not carry the
X4 mutation. This suggests the existence of dormant
viruses that escaped latency and recombined with viruses
from the dominant population. Putative dormant strains

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/62

might enter the blood stream through the low degree of
ongoing viral replication that is thought to occur in
latently infected, resting CD4+ T cells [26,27].
Patient 8
The network of patient 8 as shown in Figure 2 also suggests the resurgence of reservoir viruses as suggested by the
inferred recombinant sequence 81 m-14(97). The putative right-hand donor 17 m-c was sampled over 5 years
earlier and does not have any sampled direct descendants
that inherited the whole length of its sequence. The
recombination event generating the sequence 95 m07(96) joined two separate lineages, with the upper lineage ending at 70 months with sequence 70 m-13(68).
Most recombinant sequences from 70 months and later
had one donor that was from a different lineage. Patient 8
started on antiretroviral therapy at the 81 months period,
the second to last sampling time, after a drastic decline in
the number of CD4+ T-cells, but no increased recombination effect could be observed.
Patient 9
As with patient 8 and 2, the network of patient 9 (shown
in Figure 3) suggests the resurgence of reservoir virus as
indicated by the recombination events at 129 months.
Sequences 9 m-383 × 2(88) (with 2 identical copies) and
9 m-393(88) and its progeny 86 m-3(86) are predicted to
be putative dormant strains that escaped latency. This pattern of dormant viral strains involved in recombination
events with strains from later periods will be discussed in
more detail in the following sections.

One aspect that has become apparent is the elevated
number of recombinants among the X4-mutants, some of
which produce strains without the X4 mutation. As previously observed with patient 2's network, the earliest putative ancestor of the X4 lineage is a recombinant itself,
namely the sequence 86 m-19(98), and has predicted
donors from two separate lineages, one that ceased to exist
at 111 months and the other that persisted in recombination events through 134 months. Yet another feature of
interest is that many recombinant sequences in patient 9
are themselves putative parental donors contributing to
other recombination events. Patient 9 was on Zidovudine
(ZDV) therapy since a doctor's visit at 57 months and was
the only patient (among the ones considered in this work)
with data spanning a long period of therapy of over 6
years.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by considering the data
on all 8 patients (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8). The networks of patients 1, 3, 6 and 7 showed only one single lineage with few recombination events. In contrast, it is
remarkable that patient 5's network showed two separate

lineages that coexisted until the 56 months sampling time
point with no consensus recombination events linking
them at any time point. Several sequences of patient 5
were predicted as recombinants by the different methods
but no consensus was reached in these cases.
The networks revealed that the ancestors of the X4 strains
were either recombinant or displayed strong recombination signals. A recombination signal is defined as an indication that different parts of a viral sequence may descend
from different ancestors. In order to determine the significance of this pattern a score was devised to measure the
recombination signal (RS) based on the average bootstrap
support (BS) of the non-recombinant inferences, the
number of recombinants (R) and the number of different
ancestors (A) from the 6 results produced by analyzing
two alignments (one gapped and one gap-balanced for
subsets of the same data) by the 3 methods previously
described. While only the consensus predictions are considered in the network construction, conflicting results
may still indicate support for a recombination event,

based on those three parameters. The strength of this support is measured by the recombination signal. The score is
given by the following formula:

RS =

1⎛
R A⎞
⎜ (1 − BS) + + ⎟
3⎝
6 6 ⎠

A low bootstrap support can indicate that either there is
more than one possible ancestor, signaling a possible
recombination event, or the determination of the ancestor
is inconclusive. Results that differ in their ancestor prediction may also indicate a recombinant origin. A t-test confirmed that the ancestors of the X4 strains had a
significantly higher recombination signal than the overall
average recombination signal in all 8 patients (p = 0.003).
In a further effort to investigate the relationship between
clinical factors and evolutionary parameters we analyzed
possible associations between the proportion of recombinants, the proportion of X4 mutants, the peaks in the
viral load levels and the administration of antiretroviral

drug therapy as shown in Figure 9. The information about
the viral load levels were obtained from the authors of the
previous study [21]. Several consistent patterns in the disease development of moderate HIV progressors were
observed in a previous study: significant correlations were
found between the years it took for the X4 virus to emerge
and the time (since seroconversion) to peak virus diversity, between the time to peak prevalence of X4 and the
time to divergence stabilization, and between the time to
divergence stabilization and the time to T-Cell homeostasis failure [21]. In the current study we sought to find
trends between the peak of viral load levels and the proportion of sequences identified as recombinants or as X4
mutants.
In this study, a consistent relationship was noted among
the 8 patients between time variables involving clinical
markers and proportion of recombinants as shown in Fig-

ure 10. The time from seroconversion to the observed
peak of viral load and the time to peak proportion of
detected recombinants were found to be significantly correlated (correlation coefficient r = 0.8, 2-tailed p = 0.016;
if patient 5 was removed, the values were r = 0.89, p =
0.0072). An even higher correlation was found between
the time to the lowest CD4+ T Cells levels and the time to
peak proportion of detected recombinants (r = 0.87, 2tailed p = 0.0042). The time to peak representation of X4
viruses and time to peak proportion of detected recombinants were also found to be correlated with a borderline
significance (r = 0.69, 2-tailed p = 0.0562). In all cases,
removing the outlier patient 5 improved the correlation
coefficient and significance of the tests. Previous work
showed that relative to failure of T-cell homeostasis, peak
viral diversity occurred a mean of 2.2 years earlier with
correlation analysis indicating that these two events where
highly related [21]. No significant correlation was found

between start of therapy and proportion of detected
recombinants. The patterns involving putative reservoir
virus could not be investigated statistically due to the low
number of cases and the low bootstrap support of the
non-recombinant evolutionary relationships.
We next asked if the star-like evolutionary pattern
observed in the network of the five patients who died at
the end of the study was associated with a faster disease
progression. A star-like pattern is seen when many
descendants share the same ancestor. A slight negative
correlation was found between CD4+ T cell counts and
the proportion of ancestors for each time period among 6
of the eight patients (with a mean slope of -0.19). A one
sample t test comparing the mean slopes to a slope of zero
returned a p-value of 0.0566.
Analysis of the sequences predicted as recombinants
revealed that the average breakpoint position of X4
recombinant sequences was further to the right towards
the V4 region of the env gene. The average breakpoint
position for the non-X4 recombinant sequences was 373,

while for the recombinant X4 sequences it was 427. A 1tailed paired t-test returned a p-value of 0.0475. The analysis included predictions from the 6 result files per
patient, far more than the few consensus recombinant
sequences shown in the evolutionary networks. For example, for patient 5, there are many recombinant predictions
but little consensus in most of them. No significant difference was found between breakpoint positions before and
after drug therapy. The scatter plots of the breakpoint
positions in relationship to the sampling time showed
considerable diversity from patient to patient. The plots
indicated a preference for the 300 to 500 bp region in all
patients, but no particular in vivo hotspot for recombination could be observed. The distribution of recombination sites for all predicted recombinant sequences did not
show discernible patterns across the C2 to C5 region with
the exception of patient 1, for whom the breakpoint sites
moved further to the left as the sampling time increased (r
= 0.79, 2-tailed p < 0.001).

Discussion
The Sliding MinPD method was used to analyze and represent the evolutionary relationships of HIV-1 sequence
data sampled serially over a period of many years from the
HIV-1 env region of eight patients. The network representation facilitated the locating of viral strains due to the
temporal organization within the network and allowed
for a better understanding of the evolutionary relationships of within-patient HIV strains. The evolution of HIV
within-host environments is very different from betweenhost HIV evolution. There is strong evidence that natural
selection is the driving force of within-host evolution.
Within-host HIV phylogenies have a strong temporal
structure, reflecting the successive fixation of advantageous mutations and the extinction of unfavorable line-

ages [2]. This can be observed in all the serial evolutionary
networks presented here. Each of the networks obtained
from the sequence data for the different patients appears
to be qualitatively different and reveals different aspects of
the evolutionary relationships among the data. Nevertheless, some surprising patterns could be observed.
Patterns
A few of the recurring patterns observed in the evolutionary networks of the eight patients are summarized below
and will be discussed in more detail in the next section:

▪ The network of the five patients who died at the end of
the study displayed a starlike evolutionary pattern

(approximate time of death in months appears in the network next to the symbol †).
▪ The founder strains of the lineage containing the X4
strains displayed significantly stronger recombination signals.
▪ Recombination events with early viral quasispecies suggest the resurgence of reservoir virus.
▪ Recombination events linking different major lineages
were observed in the three surviving patients.
Star-like evolution in the path to AIDS death
It is important to mention the role that the visualization
of the results plays in understanding the different patterns
of within-host viral evolution. The evolutionary networks
made it easy to locate any viral strain due to the temporal

positioning within the network, where strains sampled at
the same sampling point were vertically aligned. The network representation can also encourage the pursuit of new
research directions or generate new lines of inquiry. For
example, knowing that five of the eight patients passed
away after the analysis period, it was possible to ask
whether any marked differences existed between the networks for the surviving and the deceased patients. As discussed in the results section, the networks of patients 2, 8
and 9 shared very similar characteristics such as the persistence of different lineages, unbalanced networks (as
opposed to star-like networks where many branches
extend in a balanced manner from a root node), recombination events between lineages and recombination events
with much earlier viral strains. On the other hand, with
the exception of patient 5, the networks of the other
patients lacked these characteristics, with a distinctive starlike evolution of one single lineage from the onset of the

study. Explosive growth generates characteristic 'star-like'
phylogenies in which a single strain, the 'master sequence'
in quasispecies theory, gives rise to a large population of
diverse quasispecies with a spectrum of small mutational
changes from the master sequence [28,29]. No literature
could be found that linked star-like virus evolution with
faster disease progression, but the association deserves to
be studied more closely in the future.
Evolution of the X4 mutants
The network representation allowed us to better understand the evolutionary roadmap of the X4 strains. Each of
the patients had X4 strains, which are known to be associated with a higher rate of decline of CD4+ T-cells, and
therefore, a more rapid progression to AIDS [2]. Traditional phylogenetic tree models do not consider recombination events and in its presence may represent
misleading evolutionary relationships. Evolutionary networks counteract that shortcoming by combining muta-

tion and recombination models into one. The
evolutionary networks presented here facilitate the investigation of patterns with regard to the emergence of the X4
strains. A recombinant origin for the X4 strains is suggested by all the patient's networks, and was found to be
a statistically significant pattern as discussed in the results
section. The founder strain of the lineage containing the
X4 genotype was either a recombinant or had very low
bootstrap support, which often happens when the methods are split on their choice of an ancestor. For example,
sequence 34 m-81(38) in patient 1 had a low bootstrap
support for its choice of ancestor (38%). Other sequences
with low bootstrap support were 30 m-13(33) in patient
3, 56 m-k(39) in patient 5, 25 m-21a(34) in patient 7, 41
m-04(58) and 46 m-d(41) in patient 8. The sequences 51
m-19(93) in patient 2, 30 m-03(92) in patient 6, and 86
m-19(98) in patient 9 were predicted to be recombinant
sequences. Crossover sites for predicted X4 recombinants

were slightly to the left (toward the V4 env region) of
crossover sites for other recombinant sequences.
The role of co-infection and recombination has received
some attention in recent years and these findings may
support the recombinant origin of the X4 strains [30-32].
It has been shown that frequent double infection can
occur with CCR5- and/or CXCR4-tropic viruses, thereby
generating opportunities for recombination to occur
within viral populations [30].
Remarkable Recombination Events
The serial evolutionary network representation allowed us
to look for patterns present in the networks of the three
surviving patients and absent in the other networks. As

discussed earlier patients 8 and 9 have very similar network characteristics: separate lineages with linking recombination events and recombination events with strains
from a much earlier time point. Patient 2 also displayed
separate lineages and similar but less obvious patterns of
recombination. In contrast to those three, Patient 5's network displays two long-lasting lineages with no linking
consensus recombination events.
The presence of different types of HIV reservoir cells that
harbor dormant virus has been discussed in many studies
[26,27,33,34]. The persistence of reservoirs of HIV,
including latently infected, resting CD4+ T-cells, which
can give rise to infectious HIV after a period of latency, has
posed a sobering challenge to the long-term control or

eradication of HIV in infected individuals receiving highly
active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). These reservoir
viruses may co-infect a cell already infected with viruses
from the current population, giving rise to new viral particles with 2 different parental RNA. It has been shown
that HIV-1 coinfection and recombination foster rapid
virus diversification and survival, and that productive cellular coinfection is not inhibited by cellular mechanisms
[32]. In the current study, even though the framework
allows for such inferences, many of the non-recombinant

evolutionary relationships with putative escape reservoir
virus had low bootstrap support, thus preventing us from
finding support for such a claim.
In a recently proposed controversial model [35], it was
suggested that clinical AIDS occurs only when immunesystem cells were co-infected at a high rate – and the fastkilling virus strains won out. Our observations do not
contradict this model, but we argue that co-infection may
in some cases slow down disease progression when

Summary of recombination, X4 and viral load patterns
Summary of recombination, X4 and viral load patterns. The X-axis shows the sampling times in months post seroconversion, while the Y-axis shows the proportion of recombinants (blue diamond shapes) and X4 (orange square shapes)
sequences. The light green thick line at the bottom along the X-axis shows the start and duration of antiviral drug therapy. The
vertical dashed line indicates the highest peak in viral load levels; the dark dotted vertical line indicates the second highest peak,
and the light dotted line the third highest peak in viral load levels. Patient 1 had only two viral load peaks, with a peak defined
as a high point before a decline or at the last study time point.

recombination is able to weed out the growing, but weak
cytopathic effect of one of the infecting strains through
the creation of more fit mosaic genomes. A fit virus in this
context is a virus which survives by not killing its host.
This could be a possible explanation for the observed patterns in the networks of patients 8 and 9. Recombination,
like mutation, can have two outcomes: the new mosaic
virus may propagate without destroying its host environment or it may propagate while leading to the extinction
of its host. Maintaining low viral levels can ensure that
mutation and recombination have less say in their evolutionary game of chance.
Figure 9, which summarizes patterns of recombination
events as predicted by the Sliding MinPD method, suggests a linkage between the peaks in viral load levels and
the peaks in the proportion of detected recombinants. The
observation of an increase in the proportion of detected

recombinant sequences may also, however, be attributed
to other factors, such as an increase in viral sequence
diversity. Sequence diversity was shown in a previous
study to be highly related to the viral load levels [21].
Peaks in the viral load levels seem to correlate with the
amount of recombinants at each sampling time. This is
plausible in view of the mechanism of recombination in
HIV-1, in which the likelihood of producing mosaic
genomes increases with the number of diverse pairs of
RNA strands that get packaged into a viral particle.
The current study did not estimate the Ka/Ks ratio of selection pressure, as it is known that recombination can affect
the estimation of that measure. Current sitewise methods
for detecting positive selection on gene sequences assume
no recombination. When this assumption is violated it
can lead to incorrect detection of sites undergoing positive
selection [36]. A recent Bayesian MCMC method tries to

solve the problem by estimating variation in selection
pressure along a sequence in the presence of recombination [37] and will be used in future research.

Conclusion
The serial evolutionary networks of the 8 patients revealed
different aspects of the within-host evolution of the HIV
virus. Among the networks for the 8 patients we found
several consistent patterns that are of evolutionary significance with potential impact on the development of new
anti-retroviral drugs. The visualization of the results
played an important role in understanding the different
patterns of within-host viral evolution. The network representation suggested new avenues of research and lead to
statistical analysis that connected our observations with
known facts and previously published results on the evolution of the HIV-1 virus. The serial evolutionary network
proved to be an effective and useful tool, able to produce
noteworthy results, as well as generate important and productive new lines of inquiry in the study of viral evolution.
The main line of inquiry was aimed at studying the origin
of the disease associated X4 strains. As previously discussed, the putative founder strains of the X4 population
are most likely a result of recombination events in large
and diverse viral populations. Our results suggest that evidence of recombination increases with higher viral loads.
On the other hand, recombination between strains from
different lineages or between reservoir viruses and the
viruses from the dominant population were more prevalent in the asymptomatic patients. A star-like topology
could be observed in the networks of four of the five
patients who died of AIDS. As mentioned in the earlier
study [21], it is not clear whether the patterns and
sequence of events observed with the current selection of
patients can be generalized to patients with a slower or
faster disease progression rate. Despite these concerns,
this study offers new insights into the role of recombination on HIV evolution within a patient and a practical
methodology for making inferences from these evolutionary networks.

programs for this kind of data, should prove extremely
useful in such analyses. Although modern HIV combination drug therapy has been successful at suppressing viral
replication to <50 c/ml in patients who adhere to treatment, viral replication has been shown to persist in viral
reservoirs and inconsistent adherence to treatment can
lead to drug resistance. Moreover, in developing countries, infected individuals with limited access to drugs face
an increased risk of developing AIDS. It therefore continues to be of foremost importance to understand the evolutionary process of HIV within a patient to aid in the
design of effective drug treatments and in the evaluation
of patient prognosis.

Recent sequencing technologies such as that from 454 Life
Sciences have made it possible to quickly and cheaply
generate a large number of short clonal transcripts (~100–
400 bp). The inevitability of large-scale HIV within-host
sequences data in the near future makes it critical to
develop analytical methods of the kind presented in this
paper. We expect an abundance of new clonal sequences
from longitudinal studies, which can be used in the reconstruction of serial evolutionary networks for a much larger
number of patients and can contribute to the development of tools for HIV patient surveillance and prognosis.
