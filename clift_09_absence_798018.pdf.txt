Abstract
Background: In rodents, the cell surface complement regulatory protein CD46 is expressed
solely on the spermatozoal acrosome membrane. Ablation of the CD46 gene is associated with a
faster acrosome reaction. Sperm from Apodemus flavicollis (yellow-necked field mice), A. microps
(pygmy field mice) and A. sylvaticus (European wood mice) fail to express CD46 protein and exhibit
a more rapid acrosome reaction rate than Mus (house mice) or BALB/c mice. A. agrarius (striped
field mice) belong to a different Apodemus subgenus and have pronounced promiscuity and large
relative testis size. The aim of this study was to determine whether A. agrarius sperm fail to express
CD46 protein and, if so, whether A. agrarius have a faster acrosome reaction than Mus.
Methods: Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to assess whether
A. agrarius transcribe testicular CD46 mRNA. RT-PCR was supplemented with 3'- and 5'-rapid
amplification of cDNA ends to determine the complete nucleotide sequence of A. agrarius CD46.
Fluorescence microscopy was used to assess whether CD46 protein is expressed by A. agrarius
sperm. The acrosome status of A. agrarius sperm was calculated over time by
immunocytochemistry using peanut agglutinin lectin.
Results: We demonstrate that A. agrarius mice transcribe two unique alternatively spliced
testicular CD46 mRNA transcripts, both lacking exon 7, which differ from those described
previously in other Apodemus species. The larger A. agrarius CD46 transcript has an insert
between exons 10 and 11 which, if translated, would result in a novel cytoplasmic tail. In addition,
A. agrarius CD46 transcripts have an extended AU-rich 3'-untranslated region (UTR) and a
truncated 5'-UTR, resulting in failure to express spermatozoal CD46 protein. We show that A.
agrarius has a significantly faster spontaneous acrosome reaction rate than A. sylvaticus and Mus.

Conclusion: Absence of CD46 protein expression is associated with acrosomal instability in
rodents. A. agrarius mice express novel CD46 transcripts, resulting in the trade of spermatozoal
CD46 protein expression for a rapid acrosome reaction rate, in common with other species of field
mice. This provides a strategy to increase competitive sperm advantage for individuals, leading to
faster fertilisation in this highly promiscuous genus.

Background
There is pronounced sperm competition in species
belonging to the Apodemus genus (field mice), which is
reflected by their disproportionately large testes [1,2].
There is also an association between relative testis mass
and the shape of the apical hook in the falciform head of
murine sperm [3]. The extremely long apical hook of A.
sylvaticus spermatozoa enables them to intertwine, forming in vivo trains of up to 100 cells [4]. These sperm formations have significantly increased velocity and
thrusting force compared with an individual spermatozoon. The A. sylvaticus sperm trains must dissociate prior
to fertilisation, which may be achieved by a proportion of
sperm undergoing a spontaneous acrosome reaction [4].
CD46 (membrane cofactor protein) is a widely expressed
cell surface complement regulatory (CReg) protein in
humans. In contrast, in rodents, CD46 protein expression
is not widespread but instead is restricted solely to the
spermatozoal acrosomal membrane, suggesting that
CD46 has a role in the reproductive process [5-9]. The
murine CD46 gene contains exons encoding four short
consensus repeat (SCR) regions, a serine/threonine/proline-rich (STP) region, a juxtamembranous region of
unknown function (UK), a transmembrane (TM) region
and a cytoplasmic tail (CYT) region [10,11].
Disruption of the CD46 gene in laboratory mice induced
a faster acrosome reaction rate compared with wild-type
control mice [5]. Sperm from wild-caught A. flavicollis, A.
microps and A. sylvaticus, belonging to the Sylvaemus subgenus, have been shown to exhibit a more rapid acrosome
reaction rate than wild-caught Mus musculus or inbred
BALB/c laboratory mice [12]. Abnormal testicular CD46
mRNA transcripts lacking exons 5–7 and 6–7, together
with extended 3'- and truncated 5'-UTRs, were detected in
these species, resulting in failure to express CD46 protein
on testicular or epididymal sperm. It was proposed that
these species have traded CD46 protein expression for
acrosomal instability to favour more rapid fertilisation
[12].
In contrast to the aforementioned Apodemus species, A.
agrarius mice belong to a nominotypical subgenus of Apodemus [13,14] and have the highest level of promiscuity in
any rodent species studied to date [15,16]. As in the ecologically diverse Apodemus species studied previously,

there is pronounced sperm competition in A. agrarius for
individual mating success.
The aim of the present study was to determine whether
sperm from wild-caught A. agrarius mice also fail to
express CD46 protein and, if so, whether A. agrarius have
a faster acrosome reaction than Mus. This would reveal
whether failure to express spermatozoal CD46 protein is
widespread in the Apodemus genus or confined to Apodemus species within particular geographic ranges.
We demonstrate that A. agrarius mice transcribe two
unique alternatively spliced testicular CD46 mRNA transcripts, with extended 3'- and truncated 5'-UTRs, resulting
in failure to express spermatozoal CD46 protein. We show
also that A. agrarius has a significantly faster spontaneous
acrosome reaction rate than both A. sylvaticus and Mus.
This study provides further support in favour of a role for
CD46 in stabilisation of the acrosomal membrane in
rodents.

Methods
Mice
Male A. agrarius and A. sylvaticus mice were caught from
Slovakia and the Czech Republic, respectively. M. m. musculus mice were caught from around Buskovice (Czech
Republic). All mice had reached sexual maturity. Wildcaught A. agrarius, A. sylvaticus and M. m. musculus, as well
as inbred BALB/c mice, were maintained in a pathogenfree facility at the Department of Zoology, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic. All animal procedures were
carried out in accordance with the Animal (Scientific Procedure) Regulations and subjected to review by the local
Ethical Committee.
Testicular RNA extraction and reverse transcription
Testicular RNA was extracted using ice-cold Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) according to the protocol provided. RNA was stored at -20°C in DNAse- and RNAsefree water. Reverse transcription (RT) of testicular RNA
was performed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen, Paisley, UK).
RT-PCR
RT-PCR reactions were conducted according to the ReddyMix Taq ×2 protocol (ABgene, Epsom, UK). The primers
used in RT-PCR reactions when amplicons were subse-

quently sequenced are shown in Table 1. A murine
ADAM2 (fertilin-beta) primer set was used in positive
control reactions. 10 μl of CD46 PCR products and 2 μl of
ADAM2 PCR products were visualised by 2% agarose gel
electrophoresis and purified using the standard QIAquick
PCR purification kit gel extraction protocol (Qiagen,
Crawley, UK). Testicular CD46 amplicons were sequenced
by primer extension using an ABI PRISM Sequence Detection System at Lark Technologies (Takeley, UK).
Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)
The 3'-RACE protocol was identical to the Invitrogen 3'RACE kit protocol, except that different anchor primers
were used (Table 1) and an additional nested PCR step
was added. The 5'-RACE protocol was based on the Invitrogen 5'-RACE kit protocol, with the following modifications. Firstly, cDNA was not treated with RNAse and was
ethanol precipitated. 16.5 μl of cDNA was used in the tailing step rather than 6.5 μl, and samples were incubated
with terminal deoxynucleotide transferase for 30 minutes
instead of 10 minutes. Also, different anchor primers were
used (Table 1) and an additional nested PCR step was
added.
Antibodies
A rabbit anti-A. sylvaticus CD46 peptide polyclonal antiserum was raised against a 14-mer peptide (PFEAMELKGTPKLY) from the predicted SCR1 domain of A. sylvaticus
CD46, as previously described [12]. This high-titre polyclonal antiserum was affinity-purified against non-conjugated peptide immobilised to an agarose gel support

using a Sulfolink kit (Perbio Science, Cramlington, UK)
and eluted with 100 mM glycine buffer (pH2.8). A rat
anti-rat CD46 polyclonal antiserum generated using a
recombinant fusion protein comprising IgG-Fc and rat
SCR2-3 CD46 domains was a kind gift of B. P. Morgan, C.
L. Harris and M. Mizuno, Cardiff University School of
Medicine [17].
Immunocytochemistry
Epididymal sperm smears were permeabilised for 10 minutes in acetone pre-cooled at -20°C, air-dried and blocked
using 3% normal goat serum for 1 hour. Slides were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 hour, followed by secondary antibodies for 30 minutes at optimised dilutions
in phosphate-buffered isotonic saline. Rabbit preimmune serum was used as a negative control, whereas
the monoclonal antibody 18.6, which recognises an acrosome-associated antigen [18], was used as a positive control and was a kind gift of H. D. M. Moore, University of
Sheffield. Slides were mounted and DNA was stained
using Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector
Laboratories, Peterborough, UK). Slides were visualised
using an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus, Prague,
Czech Republic) and images taken using a TCS SP2 RS
high-speed confocal/two-photon system (Leica, Prague,
Czech Republic).
Acrosome reaction rate measurement
The distal region of the tail of the epididymis was placed
into PBS for 10 minutes at 37°C under 5% CO2. The spermatozoa recovered were capacitated at a concentration of

5 × 106 sperm/ml in M2 fertilisation medium (SigmaAldrich, Prague, Czech Republic) under paraffin oil. Spermatozoa were collected at 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 and 120 minutes, stained to assess acrosomal status using 5 μM Alexa
peanut agglutinin (PNA) lectin (Molecular Probes,
Prague, Czech Republic) and immediately assessed under
an epifluorescent microscope (Olympus, Prague, Czech
Republic). Spermatozoa motility and viability were examined throughout experiments with a Sperm Viability Kit
(Molecular Probes, Prague, Czech Republic) using an
inverted microscope with a stage thermostatically controlled at 37°C. Spermatozoa viability was always greater
than 86%.

Results
A. agrarius mice express two unique alternatively spliced
testicular CD46 transcripts
RT-PCR was conducted using testicular mRNA derived
from two wild-caught A. agrarius mice to ascertain whether
A. agrarius express unusual CD46 transcripts. Use of a
BALB/c-specific exon 5–11 primer set (Table 1) generated
no product from A. agrarius or A. sylvaticus testicular mRNA
(Figure 1A), whereas use of an A. sylvaticus-specific exon 5–
11 primer set (Table 1) generated two cDNA amplicons
from A. agrarius testicular mRNA, which were both larger
(509 and 564 bp) than the amplicon generated from A. sylvaticus testicular mRNA (326 bp) (Figure 1B).

A. agrarius CD46 amplicons were purified and sequenced.
The smaller A. agrarius CD46 amplicon was 183 bp larger
than the corresponding A. sylvaticus amplicon. Sequencing revealed that the disparity in size was due to the
absence only of exon 7 from the larger A. agrarius transcript compared to the absence of both exons 6 and 7
from the A. sylvaticus CD46 transcript. The complete
nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of the
smaller A. agrarius CD46 isoform is shown in Figure 2.
Sequencing of the larger A. agrarius exon 5–11 amplicon
revealed that exon 7 is also absent from this transcript.
However, there was an additional 55 nucleotides inserted
between exons 10 and 11. This 55 nucleotide insert had
96% homology to a 55 nucleotide sequence within intron
10 of the C57/BL mouse CD46 gene. Therefore, this 55
nucleotide insert in the larger A. agrarius CD46 transcript
is likely to have been encoded from the equivalent
intronic region of the A. agrarius CD46 gene. Figure 2
shows the location and nucleotide sequence of this 55
nucleotide insertion.
Two nucleotide polymorphisms were revealed in A. agrarius CD46 mRNA, at nucleotides 6 (C or T) and 125 (A or
G) (Figure 2). This is consistent with the previous observation that both inter- and intra-species polymorphisms
in the CD46 gene occur in the Apodemus genus, unlike in
the Mus genus [12]. Surprisingly, none of the alternatively

spliced CD46 transcripts previously identified in other
species of the Apodemus genus (Johnson et al., 2007) were
detected in the testis of A. agrarius. Also, no CD46 transcripts incorporating all exons were detected using A.
agrarius testicular RNA.
A. agrarius testicular CD46 transcripts have an extended
3'- and truncated 5'-untranslated region
RT-PCR was supplemented with 3'- and 5'-RACE to obtain
the complete nucleotide sequence of A. agrarius CD46
mRNA. Like CD46 transcripts from other species of the
Apodemus genus, testicular CD46 transcripts from A. agrarius have a 54 nucleotide AU-rich (70.4%) extension to the
3'-UTR (Figure 1C). In addition, the majority of A. agrarius
5'-RACE amplicons terminated prematurely within exons
1 and 2 (Figure 1D).

insertion between exons 10 and 11 of the larger A. agrarius
CD46 transcript introduced a shift in the open reading
frame, resulting in an alternative termination codon (Figure 2). Consequently, if translated, the larger A. agrarius
CD46 isoform would have a slightly longer cytoplasmic
tail (Figure 2, CYT-B) with a different amino acid
sequence to the smaller isoform (Figure 2, CYT-A). The
predicted A. agrarius CD46 proteins differ from those predicted in other Apodemus species, which would lack the
SCR3, SCR4 and STP domains [12].
Immunocytochemistry was conducted using sperm from
wild-caught A. agrarius mice to determine whether CD46
protein is indeed expressed. No staining was observed on
the acrosomal membrane of A. agrarius epididymal sperm
using an affinity-purified rabbit anti-A. sylvaticus CD46
peptide polyclonal antibody or a rat anti-rat CD46 polyclonal antiserum; in contrast, strong acrosomal staining
was observed on M. m. musculus epididymal sperm using
both antibodies (Figure 3).
A. agrarius mice have an accelerated acrosome reaction
rate
The spontaneous acrosome reaction rate of epididymal
sperm was measured and compared with wild-caught A.
agrarius, A. sylvaticus and M. m. musculus (Figure 4). The
Post-hoc Tukey test demonstrated that, consistent with
other species of the Apodemus genus, sperm from A. agrarius mice have a significantly accelerated acrosome reaction
rate compared to sperm from wild-caught M. m. musculus
(p < 0.001). The acrosome reaction rate of A. agrarius
sperm was also significantly faster than that of A. sylvaticus
sperm (p < 0.001). These findings add strength to the
hypothesis that failure of sperm to express CD46 protein
destabilises the acrosome, resulting in an accelerated acrosome reaction rate.

isoforms are missing the serine/threonine/proline-rich (STP)

and 11, resulting in a longer cytoplasmic tail (CYT-B). A.

STP domain. The exon 7 splicing event did not disrupt the
open reading frame, and hence could not introduce a premature termination codon. However, the 55 nucleotide

Discussion
Wild-caught A. agrarius mice transcribe two unique alternatively spliced testicular CD46 mRNA transcripts which
are both different from those described previously in
other Apodemus species [12]. Exon 7, encoding the STP
domain, has been spliced from both of the A. agrarius
CD46 transcripts. The larger A. agrarius transcript has a 55
nucleotide insert between exons 10 and 11, encoded from
intron 10 of the CD46 gene. This insertion disrupts the
open reading frame, resulting in an alternative termination codon, located 33 nucleotides later than in the
smaller CD46 transcript. If translated in vivo, the larger
isoform would have an alternative novel 20 amino acid
cytoplasmic tail.

antibody and a rat anti-rat CD46 polyclonal antiserum. In
contrast, no staining was observed on the acrosomal membrane of A. agrarius epididymal sperm. The predicted A. sylvaticus CD46 peptide, against which the polyclonal antibody
was raised (Johnson et al. 2007), is identical to the corresponding amino acid sequence in A. agrarius. Therefore, if
CD46 protein is indeed expressed by A. agrarius sperm, it
should have been detected using this antibody.
As in the other species of the Apodemus genus studied previously [12], testicular CD46 transcripts in A. agrarius

have a 54 nucleotide AU-rich extension to the 3'-UTR and
a truncated 5'-UTR. Several mechanisms could explain the
absence of CD46 protein expression by A. agrarius sperm.
3'- and 5'-UTRs can modulate the transport of mRNA out
of the nucleus, translation efficacy, subcellular localisation and mRNA stability [19-21]. AU-rich elements
(AREs) are sequence motifs located in the 3'-UTR of some
mRNAs and are implicated in mRNA stability [22,23]. In
vitro studies indicate that degradation of mRNAs containing AREs requires the decapping/5'-3' decay pathway [24].
The 3'-UTR of A. agrarius CD46 transcripts resembles a
class III ARE. It is possible that the 'ARE' in the 3'-UTR of
A. agrarius CD46 induces degradation of transcripts in the
5'-3' direction in a deadenylation-independent manner.
5'-UTRs contain several elements involved in translational
control, including a 7-methyl-guanosine cap, an internal
ribosome entry site, hairpin-like secondary structures and
structural motifs that attract RNA-binding proteins [25].
The majority of A. agrarius CD46 5'RACE amplicons terminated prematurely within exons 1 and 2. Therefore,
most A. agrarius CD46 transcripts lack the 5'-UTR regulatory elements, the initiation codon and parts of exons
encoding the signal peptide and the SCR1 domain, cumulating in failure to translate CD46 protein.
As in A. flavicollis, A. microps and A. sylvaticus [12], minor
intra-species nucleotide polymorphisms occurred in A.
agrarius CD46 transcripts. Several genes expressed in
mammalian spermatozoa are rapidly evolving. This may,
in part, result from selection on males to achieve rapid fertilisation of ova under sperm competition [26,27]. Thus,
sexual selection in Apodemus could have driven the rapid
divergence. Alternatively, and more likely, the high level
of both intra- and inter-species CD46 polymorphisms in
the Apodemus genus compared to the Mus genus, which

Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2009, 7:29

has an invariant CD46 gene, may indicate neutral drift
and that the Apodemus CD46 gene has escaped strict
genetic control and is non-functional. This is supported
by the fact that CD46 protein is not expressed by Apodemus sperm.
A. agrarius CD46 consensus nucleotide sequences were
aligned against the corresponding consensus sequences
from the Apodemus and Mus species previously studied
[12]. The percentage homologies of CD46 mRNA consensus sequences between different species of the Apodemus
genus ranged from 90.4% to 98.8%. A. flavicollis and A.
microps CD46 transcripts had the greatest homology,
whereas A. agrarius and A. sylvaticus CD46 transcripts had
the least homology (Figure 5).
The predicted CD46 amino acid sequences were utilised
to construct a schematic phylogenetic tree to estimate the
relationship between CD46 from species of the Apodemus
and Mus genera (Figure 5). The tree was constructed using
the Neighbour-Joining method, with complete deletion
of gaps, Poisson correction and different evolutionary
rates with a gamma parameter of one, using Molecular

Evolutionary Genetic Analysis (MEGA) version 4.0 [28].
Analysis of nucleotide sequence homologies and the
amino acid phylogenetic tree illustrate that, following the
separation of Mus and Apodemus, the divergence of A.
agrarius precedes the more recent divergence of A. microps,
A. sylvaticus and A. flavicollis.
Exon 7 is spliced out of CD46 transcripts from all Apodemus species studied, but is present in Mus CD46 transcripts. This indicates that the genetic changes that cause
exon 7 to be spliced from Apodemus CD46 pre-mRNA
occurred following the divergence of Apodemus from Mus.
In contrast, exon 5 and 6 splicing events were observed in
A. flavicollis, A. microps and A. sylvaticus [12] but were not
observed in A. agrarius, indicating that the polymorphism(s) responsible occurred after A. flavicollis, A.
microps and A. sylvaticus diverged from A. agrarius. The
CD46 phylogenetic tree is consistent with previous phylogenetic trees constructed using data derived from
sequencing of the cytochrome b and the interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein genes, also indicating that
species of the Sylvaemus subgenus (i.e. A. flavicollis, A.
microps and A. sylvaticus) tend to be closely related to one
another [29].
Like sperm from wild-caught A. flavicollis, A. microps and
A. sylvaticus, sperm from wild-caught A. agrarius fail to
express CD46 protein and have a significantly faster spontaneous acrosome reaction rate compared to wild-caught
Mus and inbred BALB/c mice [12]. Dissociation of Apodemus sperm trains may be assisted by a significant proportion of sperm undergoing an accelerated acrosome
reaction [4]. The high concentration of hydrolytic
enzymes released may bypass zona pellucida (ZP) binding, enabling an acrosome-reacted sperm to fertilise the
oocyte. Acrosome-reacted mouse sperm are able to fertilise ZP-free eggs and produce normal offspring [30]. Thus,
spermatozoal CD46 protein expression may have been
traded for an unstable acrosome, enabling the dissociation of sperm trains via a premature acrosome reaction
and favoring more rapid fertilisation.
Interestingly, the acrosome reaction rate of A. agrarius
sperm was also significantly faster than that of A. sylvaticus
sperm. Sperm with the fastest binding rates are selected
when multiple males are competing to bind with the
oocyte [26]. A. agrarius mice have significantly larger testes
and a slightly higher proportion of litters with multiple
paternity than A. sylvaticus mice [16]. This suggests that A.
agrarius sperm are subject to higher levels of sperm competition than A. sylvaticus sperm, which may have driven
the selection of a faster acrosome reaction rate.
Sperm from CD46 gene-disrupted mice also have an
accelerated spontaneous acrosome reaction rate com-

pared to wild-type control mice [5], and Apodemus mice
appear to be naturally occurring null phenotypic analogues of CD46-/- knockout mice. Like CD46-/- mice, Apodemus mice do not exhibit any abnormalities in
spermatogenesis or fertilisation, supporting the concept
that the primary role of CD46 on acrosome-reacted sperm
is not protection against complement-mediated damage.
Instead, spermatozoal CD46 in rodents may have an
important role in maintaining acrosome integrity. The
precise molecular mechanism by which this is achieved
can only be speculated at present.
CD46 is a receptor for pathogenic Neisseria [31]. Levels of
cytoplasmic calcium are elevated following binding of
Neisseria pili to host cells, due to release of calcium from
intracellular stores. Antibodies against CD46 block this
increase in cytoplasmic calcium levels, indicating that
CD46 is involved in signal transduction [32]. The induction of calcium mobilisation by CD46 signaling may be
relevant to the acrosome reaction, and perhaps perturbed
in mice that do not express CD46 protein or in promiscuous mice susceptible to venereal infection.
Disruption of spermatozoal CD46 could also affect the
distribution of membrane proteins which associate with
it, including β1 integrins [33]. Integrins interact with several cytoskeletal proteins, including actin [34]. CD46/
CD3 costimulation of T cells results in morphological
changes and actin relocalization [35]. Cytoskeleton
restructuring throughout capacitation is crucial for successful membrane fusion prior to the acrosome reaction.
CD46 associates with kinases (including Erk1/2 and
MAPK) both directly and indirectly through integrins
[35,36], and Erk1/2 and p38 MAPK are involved in the
acrosome reaction [37].
CD46 may thus be involved in intracellular signaling
events related to the acrosome reaction. Failure to express
CD46 protein in Apodemus, including A. agrarius, may
alter intracellular signaling and destabilise the acrosomal
region.

Conclusion
A. agrarius mice transcribe two unique alternatively
spliced CD46 transcripts, with truncated 5'- and extended
3'-UTRs. The majority of A. agrarius CD46 transcripts are
lacking 5'-UTR regulatory elements, in addition to the initiation codon, resulting in failure to translate CD46 protein. A. agrarius has a significantly faster acrosome
reaction rate than Mus and, indeed, A. sylvaticus. Absence
of CD46 protein expression is associated with acrosomal
instability in rodents. Spermatozoal CD46 protein expression in A. agrarius may have been traded for an unstable
acrosome, enabling the dissociation of sperm trains via a
premature acrosome reaction. This favours more rapid fer-

tilisation, providing an unexpected molecular mechanism
to increase competitive sperm advantage in this highly
promiscuous species.
