Abstract
Background: The Pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAGs) belong to a large family of aspartic
peptidases expressed exclusively in the placenta of species in the Artiodactyla order. In cattle, the
PAG gene family is comprised of at least 22 transcribed genes, as well as some variants. Phylogenetic
analyses have shown that the PAG family segregates into 'ancient' and 'modern' groupings. Along
with sequence differences between family members, there are clear distinctions in their spatiotemporal distribution and in their relative level of expression. In this report, 1) we performed an
in silico analysis of the bovine genome to further characterize the PAG gene family, 2) we scrutinized
proximal promoter sequences of the PAG genes to evaluate the evolution pressures operating on
them and to identify putative regulatory regions, 3) we determined relative transcript abundance
of selected PAGs during pregnancy and, 4) we performed preliminary characterization of the
putative regulatory elements for one of the candidate PAGs, bovine (bo) PAG-2.
Results: From our analysis of the bovine genome, we identified 18 distinct PAG genes and 14
pseudogenes. We observed that the first 500 base pairs upstream of the translational start site
contained multiple regions that are conserved among all boPAGs. However, a preponderance of
conserved regions, that harbor recognition sites for putative transcriptional factors (TFs), were
found to be unique to the modern boPAG grouping, but not the ancient boPAGs. We gathered
evidence by means of Q-PCR and screening of EST databases to show that boPAG-2 is the most
abundant of all boPAG transcripts. Finally, we provided preliminary evidence for the role of ETS- and
DDVL-related TFs in the regulation of the boPAG-2 gene.
Conclusion: PAGs represent a relatively large gene family in the bovine genome. The proximal
promoter regions of these genes display differences in putative TF binding sites, likely contributing
to observed differences in spatial and temporal expression. We also discovered that boPAG-2 is the
most abundant of all boPAG transcripts and provided evidence for the role of ETS and DDVL TFs
in its regulation. These experiments mark the crucial first step in discerning the complex
transcriptional regulation operating within the boPAG gene family.

Background
Duplication of a chromosomal region containing a gene
results in two copies of the parent gene. In most cases,
purifying selection on both members of the gene pair
remains until one of the paired genes acquires an inactivating mutation(s) and undergoes degeneration to a pseudogene. Typically, the pseudogene will eventually
disappear from the genome due to chromosomal remodeling and/or locus deletion. This process is known as
'non-functionalization' [1]. While the genomes of all multicellular eukaryotes have evidence for such pseudogenes,
there are also cases where alterations have occurred within
coding or regulatory sequences allowing the formerly
redundant gene to take on entirely new functions. This
process is known as 'neo-functionalization'[2]. Neo-functionalization of a duplicated gene is rare. A distinct and
more likely alternative is 'sub-functionalization' [3,4].
According to this model, complementary partial 'loss-offunction' mutations in both genes results in the sharing of
a full complement of functions that had been performed
originally by the single ancestral gene [2]. It has been
emphasized that the changes that lead to sub-functionalization probably happen primarily at the level of regulatory regions of the promoter, rather than happening in the
coding region to directly influence protein function [5].
Alterations in regulatory elements could produce discrete
expression patterns that, together, would recapitulate the
more complex expression pattern of the ancestral gene [6].
Therefore, the end result of neo- and sub-functionalization is the birth of novel gene pairs that can subsequently
be expanded into larger gene families [2,5].
All sequenced mammalian genomes to date have
revealed, among other things, a predominance of multigene families whose products are expressed in reproductive organs such as the placenta [7-10]. Within the placenta, the chorionic trophoblasts constitute the outer
fetal-derived cells that form the interface between the
maternal uterus and the fetus. They perform a range of
transport and endocrinological functions that provide
support to the growing fetus. At times, the physiological
demands of the fetus are not necessarily compatible with
the interests of the mother to provide for current and
future offspring [11]. Consequently, the potential exists
for genetic conflict between these individuals. As part of
the interface between the fetus and the mother, gene products that are functional in trophoblast are targets of selective pressures arising from this so called 'genetic arms
race'. These selective pressures are thought to drive the
birth of novel gene families [8]. Indeed, examples of such
gene families do exist in the placenta of domestic cattle
and other ruminant ungulates. One example is a family
known as the pregnancy-associated glycoproteins or PAGs.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/185

PAGs represent one of the major trophoblast secretory
products of species in the Artiodactyla order (swine, cattle,
deer, camels, etc) [12-17]. The PAGs are related to the
aspartic peptidases (APs), a diverse grouping that includes
gastric enzymes such as pepsin and chymosin, lysosomal
enzymes such as cathepsin D, and the enzyme renin,
which is critical for maintaining salt homeostasis and
blood pressure [18]. Mammalian APs are strikingly conserved in regard to their gene structure (most mammalian
aspartic peptidase genes consists of nine exons and eight
introns) [18-23]. The APs also have a conserved bi-lobed
structure [18,24-26] with the two lobes of the enzyme
being roughly symmetrical and enclosing a substrate
binding cleft between them. Positioned within this cleft is
a catalytic center that contains two aspartic acid residues
(one from each lobe) flanked by conserved amino acids
[18,27]. These aspartates participate in the catalytic mechanism.
In species within the Ruminantia suborder, the PAGs constitute a large and diverse family [12-16,28]. In cattle, for
example, 22 distinct PAG cDNAs have been deposited in
Genbank, in addition to some closely related variants.
However, the exact number of PAG genes remains a mystery. The PAGs that have been cloned in cattle fall into two
main groupings: an evolutionarily more 'ancient PAG'
group, whose members are transcribed in all cotyledonary
trophoblast cell types, and a second group that arose more
recently (the 'modern PAGs'). These modern PAGs are
transcribed exclusively by a specialized subset of trophoblasts called binucleate cells (BNC) [13,15,29,30]. Interestingly, many of the PAGs in the modern-grouping have
amino acid substitutions at conserved positions within
the catalytic center that may preclude these PAGs from
functioning as enzymes [14,27,31-33]. The ancient PAGs
on the contrary, possess all the hallmarks of typical aspartic peptidases and are predicted to be active enzymes [27].
It is also worth noting that the PAGs are not expressed
coordinately throughout pregnancy. Some are expressed
early, while others are not detectable until later in the
pregnancy [13,34].
The sequencing and ensuing assembly of the bovine
genome has provided two unique opportunities. One has
been the opportunity to identify and evaluate all the
potential PAG and PAG-like genes represented in the
genome build. The other advantage was to gain access to
full length sequences of the PAG genes, especially their
promoter and regulatory regions, thus facilitating analyses
and insight into PAG transcriptional regulation. The goal
of this current work was to take advantage of both these
opportunities to perform an in silico analysis to annotate
the PAG genes within the bovine genome, as well as their
promoter regions. Particular attention was focused on the
regulatory elements of bovine (bo) PAG-2, which appears

to be the most abundant PAG transcript, and to characterize its relative expression compared to other ancient PAGs.

those transcripts with one missing exon were also
included in the analysis.

Methods

The translated sequences were aligned by pairwise comparisons by using CLUSTALW in BioEdit version 7.09
http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/BioEdit.html[39,40].
Phylogenetic analysis of the aligned sequences were performed by using the MEGA4 program http://
www.megasoftware.net/[41]. All positions within the
alignment that contained gaps or missing data were
ignored during pairwise comparisons. An initial tree was
generated by using the Neighbor-Joining method [42],
followed by Minimum Evolution [43] and bootstrapping
tests (n = 1000 replicates). The inferred consensus tree was
displayed [44].

Annotation of PAGs within the bovine genome (Build 3.1)
To annotate the PAG genes in the bovine genome, guidelines set forth for annotation by the bovine genome consortium were followed. An official gene set for the bovine
genome, termed the GLEAN set, was developed by the
consortium using a powerful gene prediction algorithm
[35], and was provided to the manual annotation community. The first step in the manual annotation of boPAGs
was to identify the closest GLEAN model for each candidate gene listed in Table 1 that were available through RefSeq or Genbank (if RefSeq was not available). The
nucleotide sequence of each known boPAG was used as a
query in BLAST searches in the bovine genome consortium web browser. The GLEAN sequence was then visually
inspected through the Apollo Genome Annotation and
Curation Tool (v.1.6.5) http://apollo.berkeleybop.org/
current/index.html[36], for the presence of a putative
translation start site, intact exon-intron boundaries and
defined 5' and 3' UTRs [36,37]. More importantly, the
open reading frame (ORF) was scrutinized thoroughly for
any mismatches with known RefSeq or cDNA clones by
performing megaBLAST searches (an algorithm for highly
related nucleotide sequences) in the NCBI bovine genome
database and a BLASTN search in the bovine genome
browser (GBROWSE) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
genome/seq/BlastGen/BlastGen.cgi?taxid=9913.
[38].
Any incompatibility was further evaluated by performing
megaBLAST against the bovine EST database in Genbank.
The sequence with the best EST support was accepted.
Based on these analyses, GLEAN models were accepted,
rejected, or refined. The final models were submitted to
the genome annotation curators for independent review
by the consortium.

In addition to the known boPAG genes, other putative
PAG-like genes were present among the GLEAN models.
These predicted genes were queried with cross-species
megaBLAST and BLASTN against the bovine EST database
and the nucleotide collection (nr/nt) database in Genbank to help determine if these predicted genes are
actively transcribed.
Phylogenetic relationships of boPAG-genes
The translated sequences for the boPAG genes used to
establish phylogenetic relationships within the PAG gene
family were displayed in bold in Table 1. All annotated
boPAGs and the boPAG genes with known mRNA sequence
(but not represented in bovine genome assembly, 3.1)
were included in the analyses. The variants of PAG genes
with a conserved nine exon structure, splice variants, and

Analysis of repeat elements within boPAGs
RepeatMasker, version 3.1.9 http://www.repeatmas
ker.org[45] was used to scan for inserted transposable elements (TE) in the entire gene sequence as well as 3000 bp
upstream of the translational start site (TSS-ATG), and
3000 bp downstream of the translational termination
codon (TAA, TGA and TAG) of each representative boPAG
gene. The parameters used for the analysis were described
elsewhere [46]. Briefly, 'cross match' was used as the
search engine, cow (Bos taurus) was identified as the DNA
source, simple repeats and low complex repeats were
requested not to be masked and the matrix was set to subloci optimization pre-runs.
Analysis of proximal promoter sequences
Investigation of selective pressures operating on the proximal
promoter sequence of boPAGs
The selective pressures operating on the ORFs of various
boPAG genes have been analyzed systematically in prior
publications [29,32]. The availability of full length gene
sequences has made it possible to extend similar types of
analyses to the PAG promoter regions. Two different
lengths of promoter sequence were chosen for comparison [1000 bp as well as 500 bp proximal to the TSS]
between several ancient boPAGs (boPAG-2, 8, 10, 11 and
12) and some representative modern boPAGs (boPAG-1, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 15, 18, 19, 20 and 21) to simplify the analysis.
The nucleotide sequences were aligned by using CLUSTALW in the MEGA4 software suite. All the deletions and
gaps arising from the alignment were eliminated by using
the pairwise deletion option. The aligned boPAG
sequences were subjected to pairwise comparisons in
MEGA4 by using the Maximum Composite Likelihood
method with 1000 bootstrap replicates to calculate the pdistance (number of differences/total length of sequence
analyzed).

In order to understand the type of evolutionary pressures
operating on the promoter regions, we plotted the

inferred p-distances obtained from the promoter analysis
against the proportion of synonymous changes per synonymous site (dS) estimated for the corresponding boPAG
ORFs. The underlying assumption for this approach was
that, dS within the ORFs would approximately reflect the
rate of nucleotide change in the locus in the absence of
selection. In other words, if the p-distance of the promoter
equals dS of the corresponding exons of the gene (p-distance/dS = 1), then the boPAG promoter is accumulating
substitutions in this region at a rate that corresponds to
that expected, based on normal mutation rates. A value >1
would indicate that nucleotide changes are occurring
faster than would be predicted and a value <1 would suggest stringent purifying selection, with fewer substitutions
being tolerated and hence retained.
Multiple sequence alignment of the proximal promoter
regions of selected boPAG genes for identification of
incorporated Transposable elements (TE) and conserved
regulatory regions
Identification of TE in the proximal promoter region
To explain for the apparent disparities in evolutionary
pressures operating on the non-coding proximal promoter sequences of the boPAG genes, 1000 bp upstream of
the translational start codon (ATG) were aligned with
CLUSTALW. Within this alignment, insertions of TE, identified by the repeat masker program, were visually
detected and mapped to the boPAG promoter sequences.
Identification of putative transcription factor (TF) binding sites in the
proximal promoter region
DiAlign TF, a component of the comprehensive promoter
analysis software, Genomatix GEMS launcher http://
www.genomatix.de/products/GEMSLauncher/[47], was
used to align and search for putative transcription factor
(TF) binding sites within the proximal promoter regions
of select PAGs. Approximately 1000 bp upstream of the
TSS (proximal promoter) of eight boPAGs [4 ancient
(boPAG-2, -8, -11, and -12), and 4 modern (boPAG-3, -5, 15, and -18)] that were recognized by the GEMS database
were used in the analysis. The following parameters were
selected for performing the analysis: Matrix library 7.0 was
used as the default library to match the TF binding sites,
and 'all' the matrix groups from 'embryo' tissue type were
selected as a reference. Input sequences were aligned and
regions closely matching known TF-binding sites that
were conserved in more than 50% of the input sequences
(4 out of 8) were mapped. The output from the analysis
was modified and presented in multiple sequence alignment with artificial shading to facilitate easier comprehension.

Estimation of relative frequency of various boPAG ESTs found within
the bovine genome
In order to estimate, how differences within the boPAG
promoters reflect in vivo expression differences, relative
levels of transcription were determined based on the representation of each gene in common bovine EST databases. Known boPAG cDNAs were each queried by
BLASTN in the NCBI bovine EST database. ESTs that
exceeded 98% in identity in at least 350 bp of query nucleotide sequence were considered to be a positive match
with a particular PAG.
Quantitative Real-time PCR of ancient boPAGs (boPAG -2, -8, -10,
-11 and -12)
It was noted from the analysis of the proximal promoters
and EST frequencies, that there were some distinct differences in both the TF-binding sites within the regulatory
regions and the EST frequencies of the boPAGs, particularly among the ancient boPAG members. Such differences
in putative regulatory elements were even observed
between two closely related ancient boPAG members
(boPAG-2 and -12). In order to determine if these minor
differences in the purported promoter elements can influence the relative expression of the boPAGs, quantitative
Real-time PCR (Q-PCR) was performed to monitor relative transcript abundance of the ancient PAGs in placental
RNA harvested from different stages of pregnancy.

RNA was extracted from placental cotyledons at various
stages of pregnancy (days 45, 60, 75, 90, 140, 170, 220
and 280) by using STAT-60 RNA extraction reagent (IsoTex diagnostics, TX, USA). Each gestational stage was represented by two different animals. The extracted RNA
preparations were treated with amplification grade
DNAse I (Invitrogen, CA, USA) at room temperature
according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The
DNA-free RNA samples were quantified and analyzed for
quality (260/280) and agarose gel electrophoresis. Two
micrograms of high quality RNA from each sample were
reverse transcribed by using an oligo-dT primer and
SuperScript III-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, CA, USA)
at 50°C for 1 hr.
Oligonucleotides for Q-PCR were designed to span exons
of each boPAG to prevent unwarranted amplification of
any trace carry-over contamination from the genomic
DNA. Oligonucleotides were also designed for a control
gene in cattle, YWHAG (tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, gamma polypeptide). Power SYBR® Green PCR master mix (Applied
Biosystems, CA, USA) reagent and the Applied Biosystems
ABI Prism 7500 Real-Time PCR system were employed for
the Q-PCR. The reaction conditions for the Q-PCR were
optimized by determining the amplification efficiency, as
well as the dynamic range for each primer set, according

to methods described by the manufacturer. Following the
preliminary evaluation, the optimum oligonucleotide sets
were selected (Table 2). The Q-PCR for each candidate
gene was performed with two biological replicates and
duplicate technical replicates. The cycling conditions
were: pre-heating for: 50°C for 2 min (1 cycle); followed
by a pre-run to activate the polymerase at 95°C for 10 min
(1 cycle) followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, 65°C
for 30 sec and 75°C for 1 min, with the data being
acquired in the 75°C window. The data was analyzed by
the ABI-PRISM 7500 sequence detection system software
and the results from the analysis were graphed.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) to evaluate the role of
ETS-2 and conserved repeats in the boPAG-2 promoter
Since boPAG-2 was established as the most abundantly
transcribed of all the known PAGs, EMSAs were performed
to determine if some of the elements conserved in the regulatory regions were capable of binding to putative TFs.
Oligonucleotides (IDT, IA, USA) were designed to encompass sequences in the regulatory region that were predicted to be involved in transcriptional regulation of the
boPAG-2 gene. The sequence of the probe encompassing
the putative ETS site is: CCTCAAGGAAGAGATCACAG.
The predicted binding site for ETS is shown italicized in
the oligonucleotide sequence. This site corresponds to
base positions -227 to -230 in the aligned sequence. The
oligonucleotides used to examine binding for the unique
repeated regions in the promoter are: GTTAACAAGTTTCTCCATGC (BR1) and TATTTTCTCCAAGTTAACAAG
(BR2). These unique repeats, which are shown italicized
in the sequence, correspond to -284 to -291 and -302 to 311, in the aligned sequence. The oligonucleotides were
annealed and end-labeled with [32 P-γ] ATP by using T4
poly nucleotide kinase. Binding reactions were performed
by using radiolabeled probe (10,000–20,000 cpm/25
fmol) with 20 μg of JAr choriocarcinoma cell nuclear
extracts in the presence of 1 μg of nonspecific competitor

(poly dI:dC; Sigma, MO, USA). The nuclear extracts for
EMSA were prepared as described by Dignam et al. [48].
The composition of the buffer used was 20% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM dTT, 250 mM
NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl of pH 8.0 containing 2% (v/v)
CHAPS detergent and 10 mg/mL BSA (Sigma, MO, USA).
For competition assays, a 50–250 molar excess of unradiolabeled competitor DNA (cold probe) was used. The
ETS- 2 antibody competition assays were performed by
mixing 2 μg of ETS antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies,
CA, USA) with 20 μg of nuclear extracts. The mixture was
incubated on ice for 30 min followed by addition of the
radiolabeled probe and incubation at room temperature
for 30 min.

Results and discussion
The PAG gene family in cattle
The PAG gene family in cattle was found to be relatively
large. A total of 22 distinct PAG cDNAs have been deposited into GENBANK, in addition to numerous variants
and pseudogenes, which underscore the complexity of
this gene family in the bovine genome. Of the 22 boPAG
cDNAs, one transcript boPAG-22 is a variant of boPAG-2
and is not distinct enough to be categorized as a separate
boPAG. However, we included boPAG-22 in our initial
analysis. Needless to say, the annotation of such an extensive gene family is prone to errors in the assembly because
of the repetitive nature of duplicated genes which are
often arranged in tandem. Therefore, one of the principal
objectives of this report was to annotate the PAG genes
within the currently available bovine genome build (3.1).
The results were compiled and displayed in Table 1. The
table contains the accession numbers for representative
cDNA, the corresponding RefSeq transcript/Bovine
Genome temporary Gene ID, in addition to the GLEAN
model best matching the sequence. Locations of these
transcripts on the chromosomal scaffolds are also indicated. In the table, "Chr Un." indicates that the gene is

unassigned to any specific chromosomal scaffold. Out of
the 37 potential boPAG genes (known and predicted),
there were 18 full length functional PAG genes that were
represented and properly annotated in the genome assembly (build 3.1). Four boPAG genes, boPAGs-7, 13, 14 and 22, previously described based on cDNA cloning, were
not represented in the build. There were three boPAG-like
genes that were predicted by the in silico gene prediction
analysis as having the conserved 9-exon structure of PAGs
(GLEAN-IDs: 24769, 10319 and 10323). One of the putative genes, the boPAG-19 like gene (GLEAN_10323) had
100% identity with the boPAG-19 gene, both in the ORF
and the proximal promoter regions. Therefore, it is presumed that this gene is a recently duplicated copy of the
boPAG-19 gene. The other two predicted genes were not
shown to be actively transcribed. Along with the full
length boPAG-like genes, there were an additional 12 predicted genes that seemed to be incomplete (e.g. missing
exons) (Table 1). The boPAG-like genes that are missing
exons are likely pseudogenes because no ESTs were found
that matched these sequences (data not shown). We consider 18 intact genes to be a conservative estimate of the
actual number of boPAG genes since some known boPAGs
were not represented in the build and we could not rule
out the possibility of additional PAG-like genes that may
have been unrecognized and not included in the assembly. All the annotated boPAG-genes that were assigned to a
chromosome location were found to be clustered on chromosome 29.
Evolutionary relationships of PAG genes in cattle
The phylogenetic relationships of various annotated PAGs
in cattle were based on their predicted amino-acid
sequences (Figure 1). The boPAGs were grouped into two
distinct sub-classes, one of the two groupings, the 'modern PAGs' comprised the bulk of the PAGs represented in
the build. They were found to be relatively tightly grouped
with short branch lengths, consistent with the relative
recent expansion of this cluster [29,32]. The others comprised a much smaller grouping (the ancient PAGs) and
had relatively longer branch lengths and were loosely
clustered.

Interestingly, the differences in phylogenetic relationships
associated with this gene family correspond to differences
in the pattern of the distribution of their message within
the bovine placenta. Those members that are expressed by
all trophoblasts are relatively ancient – having arisen
more than 80 million years ago (MYA) [29]. In contrast,
those PAGs whose expression is restricted to BNCs are relatively recently evolved genes that are predicted to have
arisen 50–55 MYA [29]. This time frame corresponds
approximately to the period in which the ruminant ungulates, with their unique synepitheliochorial type of placentation, are believed to have diverged from the swine

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/185

lineage [49]. The BNCs are the hallmark of the synepitheliochorial placenta. These large cells, which comprise
~20% of the total trophoblast population, can fuse with
uterine epithelial cells to form either a syncytium or shortlived trinucleated cells – depending on the species [5054]. This fusion event is the extent of invasiveness in ruminant ungulates and is quite unique among eutherians [5557]. This type of placentation probably developed from
the completely noninvasive epitheliochorial placenta
observed in non ruminants, such as camels and pigs
[58,59]. Similarly, the origin of the Artiodactyla order itself
has been estimated at about 83 MYA [49], a value that is
very close to the estimate of when the PAG genes as a
whole first began to duplicate. It is tempting to speculate
that the burst of duplications that created to the PAG gene
family initially were associated with the formation of the
Artiodactyla order and they arose to fulfill a role distinctly
required of the epitheliochorial placentae employed by
these species. Likewise, the formation of the Modern PAG
group may have been linked to the emergence of the subspecialized synepitheliochorial placental type of the
Ruminantia.
Identification of repetitive and transposable elements
within the boPAG genes
The incorporation of TE within genes can produce
changes in the gene structure. Furthermore, the presence
of TE in genes can provide insight into the evolutionary
history of gene families. In order to evaluate the implications of transposition events on the boPAG genes, a preliminary evaluation was performed on the sequence of
each PAG (including 3000 bp 5' and 3' of the coding
regions of the gene). The distribution of TE in representative candidate boPAGs is shown in Figure 2A. The Repeat
Masker software revealed that TEs were distributed only
within the intronic and non-coding regions of the PAG
genes. Consequently, the TEs are not directly influencing
the reading frame of boPAGs.

The ancient boPAG group in general, and boPAG-8 and -10
in particular, had slightly more TE insertions than modern
boPAGs (Figure 2B). The ancient boPAGs on average had
30.25 repeats incorporated into their sequences compared
to 23.3 for modern boPAGs. BoPAG-8 had more elements
incorporated into its gene than any other boPAGs analyzed
with a total of 37.
This was closely followed by boPAG-2 and -10 with 31
repeats each (Figure 2B). Among the modern boPAGs,
boPAG-5 had the largest number (29) of TE insertions, followed by boPAG-7 with 26 elements and -4 and -19 with
25 incorporated elements (Figure 2B). Regardless of the
number of repeats incorporated, the total amount of
sequence contributed by the introduced TEs did not
noticeably differ between the two groups. For example, in

PAGs. Also notice the relatively shorter branch lengths in the modern PAG clusters compared to the ancient PAGs.

the ancient boPAGs the average contribution to the actual
size of the gene that was contributed by the elements was
around 36.6% when compared to 35.2% in the modern
boPAGs. Again, of all the boPAGs, the percentage of total
gene length contributed by TEs was highest in boPAG-8
(44.5%) followed by boPAG-10 (43.6%) (Figure 2C).
Interestingly, the average contribution of TEs to the size of
the boPAG genes was much often less than the average of
45% in bovine genes in general, although the ancient PAG
members, boPAG-8 and boPAG-10 had reached this proportion (Figure 2C) [46]. While the TEs have not influenced the ORF of boPAG genes, they may have a role in
influencing the relative level of transcription of the genes
or in shaping the evolution of the gene family. This inves-

tigation represents a necessary first step in understanding
the role of these incorporated elements, a detailed examination is warranted to address their function in PAG gene
family, which is beyond the scope of this report.
Analysis of the promoters of boPAG genes
Selective pressure operating on boPAG promoter sequences
It was noted that the regulatory regions of the boPAGs do
not share any conserved sequences with other genes
whose expression is restricted to trophoblast (data not
shown). This analysis sought to improve the understanding of the proximal promoters of boPAGs and identify any
conserved elements within the family members. In order
to better understand the selective pressures operating on

the promoters, the observed p-distance of the promoters
were plotted against the rate at which synonymous substitutions are occurring (dS) within the nucleotide
sequences of each corresponding ORF. There were two
principal assumptions within this analysis; these were that
(1) dS of the exons of each analyzed gene pair was under
neutral selection and would reflect the normal mutation
rate for this chromosomal location, and (2) if the calculated p-distance within the promoter is equal to the dS of
the exons, then the promoter is mutating at a rate that is
expected for this location. If the observed ratio is above
one, it was considered positive selection for nucleotide
substitutions and if below one, it was purifying selection.
The analysis was performed with two variable lengths of
promoter sequence. When the p-distance v. the ORF for
the proximal 1000 bp was mapped, all of the boPAGs were
undergoing neutral to purifying selection (Figure 3A and
3B), with the exception of boPAG-10 and -6, which had
ratios of more than one (Figure 3A). These promoters
seemed to have accumulated more mutations than would

have been predicted by molecular clocks. The analysis,
when confined to the first 500 bp, generated similar
results except that both boPAG-6 and -10 showed a ratio
close to neutrality (Figure 3B). Overall, the boPAG promoters are being conserved, particularly in the first 500 bp
upstream of the TSS (Figure 3B) implying that critical regulatory elements responsible for trophoblast expression
may be positioned within this region.
Multiple sequence alignment of the boPAG promoters for
TE and conserved TF binding sites
Scrutiny of proximal promoter region for putative TEs
To account for observed differences within the proximal
promoter elements, the 1000 bp upstream of each TSS
was assessed for the presence of repeat element insertions.
The sequences of the promoters were aligned and the
position and types of TE insertions were identified and
mapped (Figure 4). Among all the boPAG promoters analyzed there were no TE insertions within the proximal 600
bp region with the exception of boPAG-10 which had a
SINE (MIRb) insertion at -317 bp corresponding to -390

bp in multiple sequence alignment (TSS being base pair
position +1) (Figure 4). An interesting observation was
that the type of TEs detected in distinct boPAG promoters
differed between modern and ancient boPAGs. In boPAG10 (an ancient PAG) for instance, there was a long SINEelement insertion from -524 to -1066 bp (-631 to > -1250
bp in alignment) (Figure 4). The corresponding region
was occupied by DNA element Charlie-8 in all modern
boPAGs and an additional LINE element (L2) in boPAG-4,
-5, -7, and -15 (Figure 4). In the ancient boPAGs there was
a ~200 bp DNA MER-108 element upstream of -750 bp
that was conserved in all the ancient boPAGs, with the
exception of boPAG-10. Therefore, the two groups of the
boPAG promoters deviated in the types of TEs that were
inserted in their upstream regulatory regions, which also

accounts for the large deviations in p-distances between
the modern and ancient boPAG promoters (Figure 3A).
Similarly, a lengthy SINE insertion was identified in the
boPAG-10 promoter that was not found in any other
boPAG promoters. The boPAG-10 promoter diverged considerably from the remainder of the boPAG promoters.
The functional significance of these inserted TEs is not
known, but a potential role for these elements in influencing the expression of boPAGs could not be ruled out.
Conservation of regulatory regions within the boPAG promoters
Based on previous reports, the boPAGs are known to
exhibit differences in both their spatial and temporal
expression patterns [13-15,28]. The availability of the fulllength promoter sequences provided an opportunity to

that were conserved in both the ancient and modern PAGs
and, therefore, may contribute to trophoblast-specific
expression. However, there were also a number of isolated
conserved regions corresponding to consensus sequences
for TF binding that were specific for ancient or modern
boPAGs suggesting that the divergence of such elements

could be responsible for the observed differences in the
spatial distribution of the two boPAG groups. Examples of
such regions within the first 350 bp of the TSS were boxed
and listed in the Figure 5. Based on this analysis, conserved putative TF binding sites are highly prevalent in
modern boPAGs. For example, there are predicted binding
sites for these TFs: HOXC13 at position -109 to -125,
RPOA (DTYPEPA) at -111 to -132, a FREAC17 at -124 to 141, FREAC2 at -149 to -166, LEF1 at -182 to -199 and 246 to -262, EN1 at -207 to -224 and SKN1 at -322 (TSS
is +1). In addition, an atypical ETS site was conserved in
all boPAGs and is located at position -227 bp to -230.
Besides these sites, there were two tandem repeats
(TTTCTCCA) 11 bp apart at positions -284 and -302 bp,
respectively. Of these two repeats, the distal repeat was
predicted to be recognized by DDVL (drosophila dorsal
ventral factor) a homolog of vertebrate c-Rel TF. These
repeats were conserved in most of the boPAGs and were
referred to as 'bovine repeats' (BR); the presence of these
repeats has been reported previously [60].

The relative distribution of boPAG ESTs in the bovine EST database
In order to verify if apparent differences observed in the
promoter sequence might be associated with the relative
levels of transcription of various genes, the bovine EST
database was searched to define the relative distribution
of various boPAG transcripts. Of all the boPAGs that were
investigated, boPAG-2 had the highest occurrence, with 92
ESTs represented in the database (Figure 6). The next most
abundant member was boPAG-11 with 46 ESTs (Figure 6).
Of the modern boPAGs that were assessed, boPAG-1 had
the highest number of EST matches with 28, followed by
boPAG-17 with 25 matches (Figure 6).
Real-Time PCR of bovine ancient PAGs (boPAG -2, -8, -10, -11 and
-12)
As described above, boPAG-2 was an extremely abundant
transcript. Therefore, follow-up experiments were performed to study the relative expression of boPAG-2 in
comparison to its closest relative, boPAG-12, and to the
other ancient bovine PAGs. Real time quantitative PCR of
boPAG -2, -8, -10, -11, and -12 were performed and mes-

comparison to the other members of the PAG family.

sage abundance was assessed relative to an endogenous
control transcript, tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5monooxygenase activation protein, gamma polypeptide(YWHAG). The source of RNA was obtained from placental cotyledons harvested at different stages of
pregnancy, between d 45 and term. The relative amount of
message for each target gene was graphed (Figure 7).
BoPAG-2 was the highly abundant transcript relative to
other ancient PAGs, while its most closely related family
member, boPAG-12, was the least abundant under identical reaction conditions (Figure 7). Relative transcript
abundance of boPAG-2 ranged from 186–1745 times
greater than the control transcript, YWHAG, depending
on the stage of pregnancy. In contrast, boPAG-12 message
was much closer to that of YWHAG; its relative abundance
varied from 0.16 to 2.21 that of the YWHAG transcript.
The relative transcript abundance of boPAG-8 ranged from
0.5 to 14.83, boPAG-10 from 0.4 – 38.6 and boPAG-11
ranged from 0.9 to 21.4 times YWHAG-expression.
Regardless of the stage of pregnancy that was examined,
the transcript abundance of boPAG-2 was at least a 100

times greater than boPAG -12 and, when compared to
other ancient PAGs, boPAG-2 message was at least 5 times
greater (Figure 7). Finally, the relative profiles of each PAG
transcript were distinct and they did not parallel one
another. One interesting observation in particular, was
that the relative temporal expression profiles of boPAG-8
and -10 were essentially opposite to one another. While
the relative abundance of boPAG-8 was higher on d45 and
was relatively stable across all other stages of pregnancy,
boPAG-10 on the contrary had relatively low level of
expression on d45 and had its highest level of expression
at term.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays
Since boPAG-2 was the most abundant transcript observed
in the bovine genome, we set out to study its promoter in
some detail. ETS-2 is a key TF involved in the regulation of
numerous placenta-specific genes, such as interferon-tau
(IFNT) [61] and the human chorionic gonadotropin
(hCG) beta subunit [62]. As mentioned previously, an
ETS-2 site is present in all boPAG promoters (Figure 5),

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrating that the putative ETS site and the repeated elements in
the boPAG-2 promoter are capable of binding proteins in trophoblast nuclear extracts. A. Competition of ETS-2
binding activity (20 μg protein) with cold ETS-2 probe. Nuclear extracts were incubated with 1 μL of 50 pmol probe, in the
absence or presence of the indicated molar excess of cold probe (indicated along the top). B. The ETS-2 complex composition
was examined by depleting ETS-2 with an antibody specific to ETS-2. Preincubation of the ETS antibody with the nuclear
extracts followed by binding reaction with the probe resulted in specific dissociation of the complex. Control: normal rabbit
serum. C and D. Competition assays indicating specificity of association of, as yet unknown, TFs capable of binding to the
unique bovine tandem repeats, BR1(C) and BR2 (D). Lane 1: labeled probe and nuclear extract; Lane 2: same as lane 1 except
for addition of a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide; Lane 3: 250-fold molar excess of unlabeled

including boPAG-2, and may be critical to its transcriptional regulation. Competition and super shift assays (Figure 8A, and 8B) were performed with 32P-labeled
oligonucleotides representing the putative ETS site from 226 to -229 (Figure 5). We utilized nuclear extracts from
JAr human choriocarcinoma cells for this experiment,
since nuclear extracts from bovine placental samples
couldn't be obtained. EMSA's with nuclear extracts from
JAr cells, which constitutively express ETS-2, indicated the
presence of a protein(s) capable of specific association
with the oligonucleotide probe. The complex could be
competed away by excess unlabeled probe and could be
decreased by the addition of an anti-ETS antibody. Likewise, the unique bovine tandem repeats (BR-1 and -2)
which were reported previously and were found to be conserved across most of the PAGs [60] were also investigated
by EMSAs to determine if proteins present in human JAr
cells are capable of binding to these repeats. A specific
complex was identified that could be competed away with
an excess of non radiolabeled specific competitor (Figure
8C and 8D) implying that these repeats could possibly
bind to endogenous TFs in placenta. Although, the exper-

iments were conducted with cells of chorionic or placental
origins from human, we anticipate that the observed
results would also hold true with bovine placental samples.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the bovine genome sequencing project has
facilitated an increased understanding of the PAG promoters and PAG gene organization. The boPAG gene family was verified to be rather large and complex with 18
functional and 14 probable pseudogenes (no ESTs have
been found for these). The analysis of the proximal promoter regions encompassing 500 bp upstream of the TSS
in all these genes revealed a high level of conservation
between these genes suggesting that crucial transcriptional
regulatory elements likely reside in this region. In silico
analysis revealed that while there were regions of conservation shared by all PAGs (probably influencing trophoblast specific expression of these genes), there were also
elements that were present only in the modern or the
ancient PAGs. Indeed, most of these class-specific elements tended to be observed in the modern PAGs. Since

these regions contain recognition sequences for putative
TFs; it is attractive to speculate that these putative regulatory sequences could contribute to the observed differences in spatial and temporal expression between PAGs.
We have shown by bioinformatics and experimental analyses that boPAG-2 is the most abundant of all the PAGs
and that the unique ETS-2 and DDVL group of TFs were
potentially involved in the regulation of this gene. While
the role of these particular TFs was implicated by the
EMSAs, the putative role of LEF1- a mediator of Wnt signaling, whose consensus recognition sequence is shared in
all modern PAGs is also an interesting candidate for future
investigation [63,64]. Likewise, CDX2, which has a demonstrated role in trophoblast lineage specification and
regulation of trophoblast expressed genes, has a conserved
putative binding site among all ancient PAGs and is
another such likely candidate for PAG transcriptional regulation [65,66]. An analysis of the actions of ETS, and
other TFs, in regulating the different spatial and temporal
expression patterns of the PAG genes will likely be an
interesting and fruitful endeavor. Finally, with the ongoing efforts to modify and further refine the genome build,
we are positioned to further our understanding of the
organization and evolution of the PAG gene family.
