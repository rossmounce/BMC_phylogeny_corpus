Abstract
Background: Protein subcellular localization is crucial for genome annotation, protein function
prediction, and drug discovery. Determination of subcellular localization using experimental
approaches is time-consuming; thus, computational approaches become highly desirable. Extensive
studies of localization prediction have led to the development of several methods including
composition-based and homology-based methods. However, their performance might be
significantly degraded if homologous sequences are not detected. Moreover, methods that
integrate various features could suffer from the problem of low coverage in high-throughput
proteomic analyses due to the lack of information to characterize unknown proteins.
Results: We propose a hybrid prediction method for Gram-negative bacteria that combines a oneversus-one support vector machines (SVM) model and a structural homology approach. The SVM
model comprises a number of binary classifiers, in which biological features derived from Gramnegative bacteria translocation pathways are incorporated. In the structural homology approach,
we employ secondary structure alignment for structural similarity comparison and assign the
known localization of the top-ranked protein as the predicted localization of a query protein. The
hybrid method achieves overall accuracy of 93.7% and 93.2% using ten-fold cross-validation on the
benchmark data sets. In the assessment of the evaluation data sets, our method also attains
accurate prediction accuracy of 84.0%, especially when testing on sequences with a low level of
homology to the training data. A three-way data split procedure is also incorporated to prevent
overestimation of the predictive performance. In addition, we show that the prediction accuracy
should be approximately 85% for non-redundant data sets of sequence identity less than 30%.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that biological features derived from Gram-negative
bacteria translocation pathways yield a significant improvement. The biological features are
interpretable and can be applied in advanced analyses and experimental designs. Moreover, the
overall accuracy of combining the structural homology approach is further improved, which
suggests that structural conservation could be a useful indicator for inferring localization in addition
to sequence homology. The proposed method can be used in large-scale analyses of proteomes.

Background
The prediction of protein subcellular localization (PSL)
focuses on determining localization sites of unknown
proteins in a cell. The study of PSL is important for elucidating protein functions involved in various cellular processes. Despite recent technical advances, experimental
determination of PSL remains time-consuming and laborintensive. In addition, researches in the post-genomic era
have yielded a tremendous amount of sequence data.
Given the size and complexity of the data, many researchers would prefer to use prediction systems to identify and
screen possible candidates for further analyses. Hence,
computational approaches have become increasingly
important.
Previous works
Extensive studies of PSL prediction have led to the development of several methods, which can be classified as follows.

1. Amino acid composition-based methods These methods utilize machine learning techniques, including neural networks [1] and support vector machines (SVM) [2-8]. This
category includes methods like P-CLASSIFIER [6] and
CELLO [7,8], which utilize n-peptide composition-based
SVM approaches.
2. Methods that integrate various protein characteristics Several methods including expert systems [9,10], k-nearest
neighbor [11-13], SVM [14-16], support vector data
description [17], and Bayesian networks [18-21], integrate
various biological features that influence localization. The
features that characterize a protein can be extracted from
biological literature, public databases, and related prediction systems. Both PSORTb [18,19] and PSLpred [14]
integrate different analytical modules and demonstrate
that the hybrid approaches perform better than each individual module.
3. Sequence homology-based methods It has been suggested
that PSL is an evolutionary conserved trait [22,23]. Efforts
to address the relationship between evolutionary information and localization identity have relied heavily on
exploiting sequence similarity to infer PSL. Such methods
include phylogenetic profiling [24], domain projection
[25], and a sequence homology-based method [7]. Several
other methods, such as PSORTb and PSLpred, also incorporate such sequence homology-based components in
their analyses.
Our contributions
The prediction of PSL presents several challenges. First,
the performance of amino acid composition-based and
sequence homology-based methods might be significantly degraded if homologous sequences are not

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/330

detected. Second, the results of these two methods are
generally difficult to interpret; therefore, it is difficult to
determine which biological features should be used to
identify specific PSL and why they work well for prediction. If the features were biologically interpretable, the
resultant knowledge could help in designing artificial proteins with the desired properties. Meanwhile, methods
that integrate various features could suffer from the problem of low coverage in high-throughput proteomic analyses due to the lack of information to characterize
unknown proteins. Finally, many PSL methods are implemented on redundant training sets, which might lead to
overestimation of the predictive performance. Thus, the
performance would be significantly lower if redundant
sequences were meticulously removed.
In this study, we propose a hybrid method that combines
a one-versus-one (1-v-1) SVM model referred to as
PSL101 (Protein Subcellular Localization prediction by 1On-1 classifiers) and a structural homology approach
called PSLsse (Protein Subcellular Localization prediction
by secondary structure element alignment) to predict the
PSL for Gram-negative bacteria. PSL101 comprises a
number of binary classifiers, where compartment-specific
biological features derived from Gram-negative bacteria
translocation pathways are incorporated. In PSLsse, we
employ secondary structure alignment for structural similarity comparison and assign the known localization of
the top-ranked protein as the predicted localization of a
query protein. Experiment results show that PSL101
achieves high prediction accuracy, which demonstrates
that biological features derived from Gram-negative bacteria translocation pathways significantly enhance the
performance. Moreover, since the selected features are
biologically interpretable, they can be easily applied to
advanced analyses and experimental designs. Most notably, the overall accuracy of combining PSL101 and PSLsse
is further improved to 93.7%, which is a 2.5% improvement over the second best method. Our analysis suggests
that, in addition to sequence homology, structural
homology can also be an effective indicator for inferring
PSL. Lastly, since sequence redundancy in the training
data often leads to overestimation of prediction accuracy,
we present an evaluation using non-redundant data sets.
It is also known that cross-validation may overestimate
the predictive performance when parameters are optimized repeatedly on the same test data. Therefore, we
adopt a three-way data split procedure for evaluating the
non-redundant data sets. The results suggest that these
techniques can prevent overestimation of the performance such that the general performance of PSL prediction
should be approximately 85%. In the assessment of the
evaluation data sets, our hybrid method also provides
accurate prediction, especially for those sequences of low
homology to the training set.

Results and discussion
Data sets
To assess our method, we utilize several data sets of Gramnegative bacteria proteins that have been used in previous
works [6-8,14,18,19]. Gram-negative bacteria have five
major PSL sites: the cytoplasm (CP), inner membrane
(IM), periplasm (PP), outer membrane (OM), and extracellular space (EC). Table 1 lists the number of proteins in
different localization sites in the data sets, which are
detailed in Table 1S of the supplementary material [see
Additional file 1].

1. Benchmark data sets: Derived from the first release of
ePSORTdb [26], the first data set, referred to as PS1302,
consists of proteins with experimentally determined localizations. The second data set, PS1444, is an expanded version of PS1302.
2. Non-redundant data sets: To assess the predictive performance of non-homologous proteins, we utilize CDHIT [27], a redundancy filtering program, to eliminate
sequences that share greater or equal to 30% sequence
identity in the PS1302 and PS1444 data sets, which yields
the NR755 and NR828 data sets, respectively.
3. Evaluation data sets: Recently, a new data set [22] comprised of 299 proteins was created for comparison of different methods. We first apply ClustalW [28] to divide the
new set into two subsets according to the sequence identity of each protein pair between the 299 proteins and proteins in the known training sets (i.e., PS1302 and PS1444)
with a cutoff of 30%. Then, redundant sequences are
removed from each subset by CD-HIT with a 30% threshold; the resultant non-redundant data sets are called
EV90_high (Ð¼30%) and EV153_low (<30%). The combination of both sets is referred to as the EV243_all data set.

Effect of biological features derived from Gram-negative
bacteria translocation pathways
Since it is impractical to try all possible feature combinations in different classifiers, heuristics guided by biological insights are used to determine a small subset of feature
sets specific to each classifier. Starting with an empty subset, a sequential forward search algorithm [29] keeps adding the best feature sets that improve the accuracy. The
process terminates when adding a feature set no longer
makes any improvement. The performance of PSL101
evaluated by ten-fold cross-validation for the benchmark
data sets is shown in the leftmost column of Table 2.
PSL101 attains overall accuracy of 92.7% and 91.6% for
the PS1302 and PS1444 data sets, respectively. Most notably, CP and IM proteins attain accurate prediction performance in terms of both accuracy and MCC, which can
be explained by the fact that proteins localized in CP and
IM are characterized by several well-known biological features in our method.

The features selected from PSL101 for the PS1302 data set
using cross-validation are shown in Figure 1; the same set
of features is used in the corresponding training and testing scheme for the PS1444 data set. The experiment
results demonstrate that our feature selection not only
yields a significant improvement in the performance, but
also correlates well with biological insights. For example,
in Figure 1, PSL101 selects signal peptides, transmembrane a-helices, and relevant solvent accessibility (i.e. SIG,
TMA, and RSA) as the optimal features to distinguish CP
and IM proteins. In addition, di-peptide composition, signal peptides, and transmembrane Î²-barrels (i.e. DP, SIG,
and TMB) are used in the discrimination of CP and OM
proteins. The combination of general and compartmentspecific features works well in differentiating between any
two compartments in each classifier; accordingly, the
overall accuracy of the combined predictions of each classifier is improved. The results support our assumption
that compartment-specific biological features derived

Effect of sequence and structure conservation
We now explore the relationship between sequence and
structural similarity and localization identity. Both
sequence and structural homology approaches, referred to
as PSLseq and PSLsse, are developed to infer localization
based on sequence alignment using ClustalW and secondary structure alignment using SSEA [30], respectively. Figure 2 shows that when the structural similarity is greater
or equal to 80%, PSLsse performs slightly better than
PSL101; otherwise, PSL101 is significantly better. Thus,
we propose a hybrid approach that combines PSLsse and
PSL101, called PSLsse+PSL101. For each query protein, if
the top-rank aligned protein shares an 80% or greater
structural similarity with any of the proteins in the training set, the localization is predicted by PSLsse; otherwise,
it is predicted by PSL101. In addition, we implement
another hybrid approach, called PSLseq+PSL101, which
uses a cutoff of 30% sequence identity [7] to combine
PSLseq and PSL101.

of the two hybrid approaches, PSLseq+PSL101 and
PSLsse+PSL101, is significantly enhanced in terms of the
overall accuracy, as well as the accuracy and MCC of most
localization sites. Most notably, the accuracy of EC proteins in both data sets is improved by 1.6%~5.3%, which
suggests that homology-based approaches can compensate for the performance of PSL101 and thereby enhance
the prediction of EC proteins. Moreover, PSLsse+PSL101
achieves an overall accuracy of 93.7% and 93.2% in the
PS1302 and PS1444 data sets, respectively, which are
0.6%~0.8% improvements over PSLseq+PSL101. We
show that homology approaches based on sequence and
structure conservation work well in PSL prediction; in fact,
structural homology could be effective for prediction in
addition to sequence homology. Thus, it could also be a
useful indicator for inferring PSL.

three-way data split
The performance of the three-way data split experiments
is shown in parentheses in Table 2. The features selected
from PSL101 for the PS1302 data set using three-way data
split are shown in Figure 1S in the supplementary material
[see Additional file 1]; the same set of features is used in
the corresponding training and testing scheme for the
PS1444 data set. The overall accuracy of PSL101,
PSLseq+PSL101, and PSLsse+PSL101 drop 0.4%~1.5%
for both the PS1302 and PS1444 data sets. Specifically,
the accuracy and MCC of the same localization sites are
consistent across the two different data sets. Moreover, the
performance of the two data sets evaluated using three-

Comparison with other approaches using the benchmark
data sets
Table 3 compares the performance of PSLsse+PSL101,
referred to as HYBRID, with other prediction methods
using cross-validation on the benchmark data sets.
HYBRID attains the best overall accuracy of 93.7% and
93.2% for the PS1302 and PS1444 data sets, respectively.
In both sets, HYBRID achieves improvements of
2.5%~3.2% in overall accuracy compared to the second
best approaches in each data set. With respect to accuracy
and MCC, HYBRID performs better than the other
approaches in most localization sites. HYBRID ranks the
best in terms of accuracy for CP, IM, and OM proteins, in
which more biological features are incorporated than the
other localization sites. The high predictive performance
for CP, IM, and OM proteins demonstrates that biological
features derived from Gram-negative bacteria translocation pathways are effective for PSL prediction. Most notably, it outperforms the second best approaches for IM
proteins by 4.9~14.6% and 0.9~3.5% in terms of accuracy
for the PS1302 and PS1444 data sets, respectively. This is
a particular strength of HYBRID because IM proteins constitute the key components of various cellular processes
and serve as important targets for drug discovery [31]. In
addition, it is interesting to note that the accuracy of IM
proteins is significantly improved from 78.7% in PSORTb
v.1.1 to 92.6% in PSORTb v.2.0, in which an expanded
homology module is incorporated. This also lends support on our assumption that sequence and structural
homology approaches could be effective indicators for
inferring PSL.
Comparison with other approaches using the evaluation
data sets
The evaluation data sets were submitted to the web servers
of each prediction method. The predictive performance is
shown in Table 4. CELLO II and P-CLASSIFIER achieve
consistent overall accuracy in the range of 71.9%~77.8%
for the EV90_high and EV153_low data sets. PSLpred
attains overall accuracy of 72.5% and 88.9% for the
EV153_low and EV90_high sets, respectively. PSORTb
v.2.0 performs very well for the EV90_high set, but poorly
for the EV153_low set. HYBRID yields the best predictions
for proteins of low sequence similarity and ranks second
best for highly homologous sequences. This demonstrates
that when no homologous sequences are detected, biological features derived from Gram-negative bacteria translocation pathways yield accurate prediction; on the other
hand, the incorporation of structural homology approach

further improves the predictive performance for highly
homologous sequences. When both data sets are evaluated on the EV243_all set, HYBRID achieves an overall
accuracy of 84.0%, which is a 5.4% improvement over the
second best method. This suggests that HYBRID could
enhance the robustness of PSL prediction, especially when

sets. The MCC for individual localization sites also drops
by 0.04~0.26. These results indicate that the general performance of PSL prediction for Gram-negative bacteria is
approximately 85% for non-redundant data sets. Methods
that are less dependent on homology detection should be
developed if highly homologous sequences are removed
completely.

Performance of non-redundant data sets
In both benchmark data sets, proteins sharing up to 30%
sequence identity comprise approximately 42% of the
sets. One drawback of a high level of redundancy in data
sets is that it could lead to poor generalization for a predictor, since the predictor might fail to assign a correct
PSL, especially for those sequences of low homology to
the training set. For this reason, the construction of nonredundant data sets is necessary when evaluating the performance of PSL prediction.

Conclusion

Here, we present performance assessments using nonredundant sequences from Gram-negative bacteria data
sets. Using the same features derived from the PS1302 set
by cross-validation, we use HYBRID to train and evaluate
the two non-redundant sets via ten-fold cross-validation.
The performance is shown in Table 5. The overall accuracy
declines markedly by approximately 8% using the nonredundant sets compared with those using the redundant

In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid method for predicting PSL for Gram-negative bacteria based on a combination of a 1-v-1 SVM model using compartment-specific
biological features and a structural homology approach
using secondary structure alignment. Experiment results
show that the SVM model achieves high prediction accuracy for both benchmark data sets, thus supporting the
assumption that biological features derived from Gramnegative bacteria translocation pathways could significantly improve the performance. The overall accuracy of
combining the SVM model and the structural homology
approach is further improved, which indicates that structural homology, like sequence homology, could also be a
useful indicator for inferring PSL. A three-way data split
procedure is incorporated to prevent overfitting of the
parameters and features. In addition, non-redundant data
sets have been used for the evaluation of Gram-negative
bacteria. The results suggest that the performance could be

overestimated if redundant sequences are considered. In
the assessment of the evaluation data sets, our hybrid
method provides accurate predictions, especially when
sequences of low sequence similarity to the training data
are detected. The proposed method can be used in largescale analyses of proteomes and is freely available for public use at [32].
There are still some challenges to be addressed in PSL prediction. In our work, we only consider proteins with single localization sites. However, proteins with multiple
localization sites are not a rarity, especially in higher order
species [33,34]. In our future development, we will consider those proteins localized to multiple compartments.
In addition, better accuracy and coverage are needed, par-

ticularly for several poorly predicted localization sites. We
will also extend our method to combine more biological
features, analyze multiple compartment proteins, and
incorporate proteins of more species, including those of
humans.

Methods
Gram-negative bacteria translocation pathways
Proteins synthesized in the cytosol must be targeted and
transported to their designated compartments in Gramnegative bacteria through one of the translocation pathways [35]. Gram-negative bacteria have five major PSL
sites, which are the CP, IM, PP, OM, and EC. Figure 3
shows some of the translocation pathways in Gram-negative bacteria. Translocations through the IM are targeted,

specific, and therefore requires one or more signals in
order to cross a membrane. For example, non-cytoplasmic
proteins contain signal sequences that direct them to
translocate through the IM. Furthermore, many proteins
localized to a compartment have characteristic structures
and amino acid compositions. Integral IM proteins contain mainly transmembrane a-helices, in which their cores
are populated by hydrophobic residues. Therefore, we
model the prediction system according to the translocation pathways by identifying signals that influence the targeting and compartment-specific features that correlate
with various localization sites.

both co-translationally and post-translationally, to the
SecYEG translocase via the signal recognition particle
(SRP)-dependent pathways and the SecB-dependent pathways, respectively. Alternatively, proteins localized to the
PP can cross the IM by the twin arginine translocation
pathway. PP proteins can be inserted or translocated
across the OM through five secretory pathways, including
Type I [36] and Type II [37] export systems. Regardless of
the mode of translocation, the process is largely substrate

System architecture of PSL101
The system architecture of PSL101, shown in Figure 4,
comprises ten binary 1-v-1 SVM [38] classifiers for the prediction of five localization sites of Gram-negative bacteria.
Each translocation step across compartments i and j is represented by a binary classifier Ci,j in which different biological features intrinsic to the proteins in compartments
i and j are incorporated. All translocations in Figure 3, i.e.,

way by using six binary classifiers. The remaining four
classifiers, although not biologically occurring, are still
constructed with compartment-specific features and combined with the above classifiers for an integrated prediction. For each query protein, a predicted class and its
corresponding probability are returned by each classifier.
To determine the predicted localization site of the protein,
we combine the results of the ten binary classifiers based
on majority vote. In the case of a tie, the localization site
with the highest average probability is assigned as the
final prediction result.
Feature extraction and representation of PSL101
We consider the following biological features to distinguish between proteins translocated to different compartments, and construct our classification framework to
mimic the translocation process of Gram-negative bacterial secretory pathways. Since some of these features may
not be readily available, we utilize several web services to
predict them.
General biological features
1. Amino acid (AA) composition: Protein descriptors
based on n-peptide compositions or their variations have
proved effective in PSL prediction [8]. If n = 1, then the npeptide composition reduces to amino acid composition,
which generates a 21 dimensional feature vector (i.e., 20
amino acid types plus a symbol 'X', for others) that represents the occurrence frequency of amino acids in a protein
sequence.

2. Di-peptide (DP) composition: Similar to amino acid
composition, if n = 2, the di-peptide composition gives a
fixed length of 21 Ã 21 di-peptides, which represent the
occurrence frequency of amino acid pairs in a protein
sequence.
3. Relative solvent accessibility (RSA): Proteins in different compartments have various buried and exposed residue compositions [39,40]. For example, CP proteins have
a balance of acidic and basic surface residues, while EC
proteins have a slight excess of acidic surface residues [41].
We use amino acid compositions of both buried and
exposed residues, with a cutoff of 25% [42], to represent
the results derived by SABLE II [43], a relative solvent
accessibility prediction method.
4. Secondary structure elements encoding scheme 1
(SSE1): Transmembrane a-helices are frequently observed
in IM proteins, while transmembrane Î²-barrels are primarily found in OM proteins [44]. Secondary structure elements (SSE) are crucial for detecting proteins localized in
the IM and OM. We compute the amino acid compositions of three SSEs [15,40], a-helix, Î²-strand, and loop,

based on the predictions of HYPROSP II [45], a knowledge-based SSE prediction approach.
5. Secondary structure elements encoding scheme 2
(SSE2): SSE1 alone cannot discriminate proteins that
share similar SSE compositions and localize in different
compartments. For example, the SSE compositions of OM
proteins might be similar to proteins localized in other
compartments, but OM proteins are characterized by Î²strand repeats throughout the transmembrane domains.
To further depict such properties in a protein, three
descriptors, composition, transition, and distribution, are
used to encode predictions of HYPROSP II. Composition
describes the global composition of a given SSE type in a
protein. Transition characterizes the percentage frequency
that amino acids of a particular SSE type are followed by
a different type. Distribution measures the chain length
within which the first, 25, 50, 75 and 100% of the amino
acids of a particular SSE type are located [46]. An example
is shown in Figure 2S in the supplementary material [see
Additional file 1].
Compartment-specific biological features
1. Signal peptides (SIG): Signal peptides are N-terminal
peptides, typically between 15 and 40 amino acids long,
which target proteins for translocation through the general secretory pathway [1]. The presence of a signal pep-

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:330

tide suggests that the protein does not reside in the CP and
several prediction methods have been developed [47-49].
We employ SignalP 3.0 [47], a neural network- and hidden Markov model-based method, to predict the presence
and location of signal peptide cleavage sites.
2. Transmembrane a-helices (TMA): Integral IM proteins
are characterized by a-helices, typically 20â25 amino
acids in length, which traverse the IM. The presence of one
or more transmembrane a-helices implies that the protein
is located in the IM. We apply TMHMM 2.0 [50], a hidden
Markov model-based method, to identify potential transmembrane a-helices.
3. Twin-arginine translocase (TAT) motifs: The twinarginine translocase system exports proteins from the CP
to the PP. The proteins translocated by twin-arginine
translocase bear a unique twin-arginine motif [51], the
presence of which is a useful feature for distinguishing
between PP and non-PP proteins. We use TatP 1.0 [52], a
neural network-based method, to predict the presence of
twin-arginine translocase motifs.
4. Transmembrane Î²-barrels (TMB): A large number of
proteins residing in the OM are characterized by Î²-barrel
structures; thus, they could be candidate features for
detecting OM proteins. We adopt TMB-Hunt [53], a
method that uses a k-nearest neighbor algorithm, to distinguish between transmembrane Î²-barrels and nontransmembrane Î²-barrels.
5. Non-classical protein secretion (SEC): For a long time,
it was believed that an N-terminal signal peptide was
absolutely necessary to export a protein to the extracellular space. However, recent studies have shown that several
EC proteins can be secreted without a classical N-terminal
signal peptide [54]. Identification of non-classical protein
secretion could be a potential discriminator for CP and EC
proteins. Predictions from SecretomeP 2.0 [55], a nonclassical protein secretion prediction method, are incorporated in our method.
Sequence and structure conservation
Because PSL tends to be evolutionary conserved, the
known localization sites of homologous sequences could
be useful indicators of the actual localization of an
unknown protein. We apply both sequence and structural
homology approaches to infer localization. For the
sequence homology approach, we develop a prediction
method, called PSLseq, which is based on pairwise
sequence alignment of ClustalW. In the structural homology approach, we employ secondary structural similarity
comparison, referred to as PSLsse. Based on secondary
structure elements predicted by HYPROSP II, we use SSEA
to perform pairwise secondary structure alignment. In the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/330

sequence and structural homology approaches, the
known localization of the top-rank aligned protein is
assigned to the query protein as its predicted localization.
Performance assessment
For comparison with other approaches, we follow the
measures used in previous works [6-8,14]. To assess the
performance in each localization class, the accuracy and
Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) [56] are calculated by Equations (1) and (2), respectively. The overall
accuracy is defined in Equation (3).

Acci = (TPi/Ni) Ã 100%
MCCi =

TPi Ã TNi â FPi Ã FNi

( TPi + FNi ) ( TPi + FPi ) ( TNi + FPi ) ( TNi + FNi )

â l
â
Acc = â â TPi â Ni â Ã 100%
â
â
i =1
â i =1
â 
where l = 5 is the total number of localization sites for
Gram-negative bacteria, and TPi, TNi, FPi, FNi, and Ni are,
respectively, the number of true positives, true negatives,
false positives, false negatives, and proteins in localization
site i. MCC, which considers both under- and over-predictions, provides a complementary measure of the predictive performance, where MCC = 1 indicates a perfect
prediction, MCC = 0 indicates a completely random
assignment, and MCC = -1 indicates a perfectly reverse
correlation.

Training and testing
We apply the LIBSVM [57] software in our experiments.
For all classifiers, we use the Radial Basis Function kernel,
and tune the cost (c) and gamma (Î³) parameters. The
probability estimates in LIBSVM are used to determine the
confidence levels of the classifications [58]. The performance of PSL101 is assessed as follows.

1. n-fold cross-validation: The data set is randomly partitioned into ten distinct non-overlapping sets of proteins
(i.e., n = 10), nine of which are used to train the predictor.
Then, the accuracy of the predictor is evaluated on the
remaining set.
2. Three-way data split: To prevent data overfitting, a
three-way data split procedure [59] is used to assess the
performance of PSL101. The data set is randomly divided
into three disjoint sets, i.e., a training set for classifier
learning, a validation set for feature selection and parameter tuning, and a test set for performance evaluation.
Here, we divide the data set into ten distinct sets: eight for
training, one for validation, and one for testing.

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:330

It is worth mentioning that among the independent data
set tests, n-fold cross-validation and jackknife tests are
often used for examining the accuracy of statistical prediction methods. The jackknife test is deemed the most rigorous and objective and it has been increasingly adopted by
investigators to test the power of various prediction methods as analyzed by a comprehensive review [60]. In our
work, we limit ourselves to using n-fold cross-validation
for suitable comparisons with other methods that also use
the same evaluation schemes.
