Abstract
Background: According to the World Reference Laboratory for FMD, a new subtype of FMDV serotype A was
detected in Iran in 2005. This subtype was designated A/IRN/2005, and rapidly spread throughout Iran and moved
westwards into Saudi Arabia and Turkey where it was initially detected from August 2005 and subsequently caused major
disease problems in the spring of 2006. The same subtype reached Jordan in 2007. As part of an ongoing project we have
also detected this subtype in Pakistan with the first positive samples detected in April 2006.
To characterise this subtype in detail, we have sequenced and analysed the complete coding sequence of three subtype
A/IRN/2005 isolates collected in Pakistan in 2006, the complete coding sequence of one subtype A/IRN/2005 isolate
collected during the first outbreak in Turkey in 2005 and, in addition, the partial 1D coding sequence derived from 4
epithelium samples and 34 swab-samples from Asian buffaloes or cattle subsequently found to be infected with the A/
IRN/2005 subtype.
Results: The phylogenies of the genome regions encoding for the structural proteins, displayed, with the exception of
1A, distinct, serotype-specific clustering and an evolutionary relationship of the A/IRN/2005 sublineage with the A22
sublineage. Potential recombination events have been detected in parts of the genome region coding for the nonstructural proteins of FMDV.
In addition, amino acid substitutions have been detected in the deduced VP1 protein sequence, potentially related to
clinical or subclinical outcome of FMD.
Indications of differential susceptibility for developing a subclinical course of disease between Asian buffaloes and cattle
have been detected.
Furthermore, hitherto unknown insertions of 2 amino acids before the second start codon, as well as sublineage specific
amino acids have been detected in the genome region encoding for the leader proteinase of A/IRN/2005 sublineage.
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the A/IRN/2005 sublineage has undergone two different paths of evolution for
the structural and non-structural genome regions.
The structural genome regions have had their evolutionary starting point in the A22 sublineage. It can be assumed that,
due to the quasispecies structure of FMDV populations and the error-prone replication process, advantageous mutations
in a changed environment have been fixed and lead to the occurrence of the new A/IRN/2005 sublineage.

Together with this mechanism, recombination within the non-structural genome regions, potentially modifying the
virulence of the virus, may be involved in the success of this new sublineage.
The possible origin of this recombinant virus may be a co-infection with Asia1 and a serotype A precursor of the A/IRN/
2005 sublineage potentially within Asian Buffaloes, as these appears to relatively easy become infected, but usually
without developing clinical disease and consequently showing not a strong acute inflammatory immune response against
a second FMDV infection.

Background
Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly communicable and economically important disease caused by footand-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Animals that can be
affected include cattle, swine, sheep, goats, wild pigs, wild
ruminants and buffaloes [1]. FMDV is a positive sense single-stranded RNA virus (genus Aphthovirus, family Picornaviridae) occurring in seven serotypes, O, A, C, Asia1, SAT
1, SAT 2 and SAT 3, each with a wide spectrum of antigenic and epidemiological different subtypes. The wide
diversity is considered a consequence of the high mutation rate, quasi-species dynamics [2] and recombination
[3,4].
Within the seven serotypes, serotype A displays the greatest number of newly occurring subtypes, which makes the
control by vaccination very difficult [5].
During 2005, a new FMDV A subtype, A/IRN/2005,
spread throughout Iran and moved westwards into Saudi
Arabia, Turkey and in 2007 reached Jordan [6]. In 2006,
we have also detected this subtype in Pakistan [7]. This
particular FMDV subtype has proven to be highly virulent
and has caused severe disease in all ages of cattle [8].
Serum neutralization assays demonstrated a closer relationship to A22 than to other serotype A subtypes [9] and
the World Reference Laboratory as well as the FAO European Commission for the control of FMD recommend, in
the absence of an homologous vaccine strain, the use of
the widely available A22 Iraq strain as vaccine [6].
For an ongoing study in Landhi Cattle Colony (LCC),
Pakistan, we have collected more than thousand swabsamples from randomly selected Asian buffaloes and cattle without clinical signs of FMD, as well as a number of
epithelium samples from clinical FMD cases. Landhi cattle colony consists of approximately 2000 farms with a
total population of approximately 300000 animals, of
which 90% are Asian buffalos and furthermore a high
number of free ranging sheep and goats. FMD vaccination
is applied to a high degree in the cattle and buffalo population, using legally purchased and black market vaccines.

stan in 2006 and also the complete coding sequence of
one isolate collected during the first outbreak in Turkey in
2005. In addition, we have analysed partial 1D sequences
derived from 4 vesicular epithelium samples and from 34
mouth swabs collected in Pakistan from Asian buffaloes
and cattle found subsequently infected with this subtype.

Results
Phylogenetic inference
The complete coding sequence (CDS) of four A/IRN/
2005-like isolates, three originating from Karachi, Pakistan (Pakistan1, Pakistan3, Pakistan5) and collected in
spring 2006, and in addition, the first recognized outbreak of A/IRN/2005 in Turkey in spring 2005, Turkey(WRL), have been compared with sequences
published in Genbank (Table 1). Phylogenies have been
inferred for the complete CDS, as well as for each protein
coding genome-region (a schematic drawing of the FMDV
genome is shown in Additional file 1).

Figure 1 displays the phylogeny of the complete CDS of
the three serotypes O, Asia1 and A, showing the close relationship of the A/IRN/2005 subtype to the A22 and A28
subtypes, circulating in the Middle East region. The A/
IRN/2005 subtype shares a common ancestor with A
Iran105 which originated from Iran in 1998.
Figures 2 and 3 displays the inferred phylogenies of the
genome regions coding for the nonstructural proteins.
The phylogeny of 2B place the A/IRN/2005 sublineage in
close relation to an A15 lineage from Thailand isolated in
1960 and in further relation to A16 Belem, isolated in
1959, A12 Valle, isolated in 1932 and O5 India, isolated
in 1962. The inferred phylogeny of the 2C genome region
displays a clear relationship between the A/IRN/2005 sublineage and an Asia1 lineage originating from the Lebanon, as well as an relation with the Indian vaccine strain
for Asia1 India97 and O1 Manisa. In both phylogenies
non-serotype specific grouping can be seen between some
Asia1, A and O sublineages, however the PanAsia sublineage of serotype O and the A22, A23 and A28 sublineage
of serotype A are monophyletic, i.e. it consists of an
inferred common ancestor. The latter sublineages are well
separated from A/IRN/2005.

We have sequenced and analysed the complete coding
sequence of three A/IRN/2005 isolates collected in PakiPage 2 of 12

The phylogeny of the coding sequence of the 3AB nonstructural proteins, which are important for RNA replication, displays the A/IRN/2005 sublineage as a
monophyletic group, but with an relation to a group of at
least 31 years old isolates, consisting of serotypes O, A and
C. Members of the latter are also in relation to A/IRN/
2005 sublineage within the 2B phylogeny.

Also the phylogeny of the coding sequence for the 3C protease, present the A/IRN/2005 sublineage as a monophyletic group, sharing a common ancestor with the
PanAsia sublineage of serotype O and the Indian vaccine
strain for Asia1 India97. The 3C phylogeny shows a
number of non-serotype specific clustering.

IRN/2005 sublineage (red) and related published sequences (black). Numbers on the nodes indicate clade credibility
values. The inferred phylogeny of the Lab genome region is, for better legibility, displayed as cladogram.
The phylogeny of the coding sequence for the RNAdependent RNA polymerase 3D, displays the A/IRN/2005
sublineage as an monophyletic group, sharing at one
point of time a common ancestor with the Panasia lineage
of serotype O and again with the previously mentioned
group of at least 31 years old isolates, as well as with the
A Iran105 and Asia1 India01 isolates.
The cladogram of the complete Leader protease coding
region present the A/IRN/2005 sublineage most related to
the A22/A28 lineages, but still with a clear evolutionary
distance (see Additional file 2).
The phylogenies of the genome regions encoding for the
structural proteins (see Additional file 3), display, with
the exception of 1A, distinct, serotype-specific clustering.
The A/IRN/2005 sublineage shares a common ancestor
with A Iran105, isolated during 1998 in Iran, within the

phylogenies for 1A to 1C. In these inferred phylogenies
the A/IRN/2005 sublineage is also in close relationship to
the A22 lineage. However, the phylogenetic analysis of the
1D genome region (Figure 4), encoding for the VP1 protein, shows that the A/IRN/2005 sublineage clusters
together with the A/IRN/99 sublineage, whereas A
Iran105 clusters together with the A/IRN/96 sublineage.
The A22 sublineage is here well separated from the A/IRN/
2005 sublineage.

authors, as well as the experience of the local veterinarians.

Discussion
Virulence and Host species
Out of nine isolates, collected from clinically affected animals, seven (78%) have been derived from cattle (Bos taurus) and two (22%) from Asian buffalo (Bubalus bubalis).
In contrast twenty-four (89%) out of twenty-seven isolates from sub-clinically infected animals, originate from
Asian Buffalo. This means that the proportion of clinically
affected animals in the bovine species is 0.7 and in buffalo
is 0.1. By comparing these proportions with each other
and applying a two-sample t-test, the t-statistic was significant at the 0.05 critical alpha level, t(96) = 3.134, p =
0.0023. Therefore, it can be concluded that the difference

A major question within the epidemiology of FMDV serotype A is why so many new lineages so regularly appear
and why there is such a great antigenic diversity within
this serotype [5]. Frequent recombinations [10], as well as
long time circulation in poorly monitored areas and species [5], have been mentioned as an explanation for this
characteristic.
This work shows that both factors may have contributed
to the appearance of sublineage A/IRN/2005.

lineage and published FMDV sequences (Figure 1) shows
that the A/IRN/2005 sublineage is related to the A22 sublineage and the phylogeny shows also an evolutionary
intermediate, namely A IRN105 isolated during 1998 in
Iran. However, the 1D phylogeny places the A IRN105 in
close relationship to the IRN96 sublineage, while the A/
IRN/2005 sublineage is more related to the IRN99 sublineage (Figure 4). Both, IRN96 and IRN99, have caused outbreaks in recent years in Turkey and Iran [11]. This
different placing may be explained by the higher phylogenetic resolution of the 1D region, due to the fact that there
are much more sequences from this region published,
than from other genome regions.
From these findings it can be inferred that the genome
regions encoding for the structural proteins may have
evolved from the A22 lineage, with different intermediates like A Iran105 and the A/IRN/99 sublineage, due to
antigenic drift.
Jackson et al. [12] concluded that recombination between
serotypes is probably widespread throughout the nonstructural gene regions and this can also be shown for A/
IRN/2005.
The evolutionary relationship of the A/IRN/2005 sublineage within the 2B and 3AB genome region and a group of
at least 31 years old isolates is noticeable, but also that
there are sharing a common ancestor with the Asia1 vaccine lineage India97 [13] and in the case of the 2B phylogeny also with other Asia1 isolates. Keeping in mind that
the use of doubtfully produced and distributed vaccine is
not uncommon in Pakistan and India, the possibility of
introduction of old virus strains to the susceptible, vaccinated population is given, providing that vaccine viruses
are not properly inactivated and thereby increasing the
risk of recombination.
Within the phylogeny of the 2C genome region the A/
IRN/2005 sublineage show a clear relation to Asia1 isolates from the Middle East, indicating recombination
between Asia1 and the A/IRN/2005 sublineage.
The phylogeny of the 3D genome region demonstrates
that the A/IRN/2005 sublineage shares a common ancestor with the same group of at least 31 years old isolates as
in the phylogenies of 2B and 3AB and in addition with the
Panasia lineage of type O, an Asia1 and O5 isolate from
India and the A Iran105 isolate from Iran. A relationship
between Asia1 and the Panasia lineage of serotype O has
been shown previously [10].

displaying an hitherto unknown insertion of 2 amino
acids before the second start codon, as well as sublineage
specific amino acids (Figure 6). Remarkably, the Lab coding region of A Iran105 cluster together with the Asia1 isolate India01.
It has to be considered that the drawback, of this and
many other molecular epidemiological studies, is that
there is not a complete temporal and spatial covering of
sequences available. However, our results give a strong
evidence for potential recombination events in the nonstructural genome regions.
An additional finding of this study is that the majority of
subclinical infections caused by the A/IRN/2005 sublineage occur within Asian Buffaloes. Considering that subclinical infections causes only weak inflammatory
immune reactions [14], the probability of a subsequent
infection of the same animal with another FMDV serotype, e.g. Asia1, and thereby the likelihood of inter-serotype recombination is increased.
Furthermore, the alignment of the deduced amino acid
sequence of the highly variable part of the immuno-dominant part of the VP1 surface protein shows distinct patterns for samples originating from subclinically infected
animals and clinically infected animals or with a recent
outbreak of clinical infected animals. The VP1 protein
plays a major role in virus cell entry and it has been shown
that residue 193 (Figure 5) plays a role in heparan sulphate recognition [15], which is required for efficient
infection of cells in culture [12] and it can be seen in Figure 5 that all, but two, of the sequences derived from clinical cases or from farms with a recent outbreak display an
alanine instead of an threonine at this position. Within
sequences derived from clinical cases a substitution of serine with proline can be seen at residue 138 and vice versa
at residue 149, within the integrin binding motif. Unlike
any of the other common amino acids, proline has a cyclic
ring and its presence creates a fixed kink in a protein
chain, leading to a change in the secondary structure and
this change may also play a role in the virus attachment
efficiency.
The scattered substitutions within the cell culture propagated isolates may be explained by adaptation processes
in the absence of immune response [16].
It can be argued that those substitutions, which are likely
going together with changes outside VP1, lead to the
observed different susceptibility to develop FMD with
clinical outcome between Asian Buffalo and Cattle hosts.

The cladogram of the Lab coding region of the A/IRN/2005
sublineage constitute a close affinity to the A22 sublineage, however the A/IRN/2005 sublineage is still unique by

Conclusion
Our findings indicate that the A/IRN/2005 sublineage has
undergone two different paths of evolution for the structural and non-structural genome regions.
The structural genome regions have had their evolutionary starting point in the A22 sublineage, a long known
and widely occurring lineage, with the AY593791 A
IRN105, A/IRN/96 and A/IRN/99 sublineages as evolutionary intermediates. It can be assumed that, due to the
quasispecies structure of FMDV populations and the
error-prone replication process, advantageous mutations
in a changed environment have been fixed and lead to the
occurrence of the new A/IRN/2005 sublineage.
Together with this mechanism, recombination within the
non-structural genome regions, potentially modifying the
virulence of the virus, may be involved in the success of
this new sublineage.
The possible origin of this recombinant virus may be a coinfection with Asia1 and a serotype A precursor of the A/
IRN/2005 sublineage within the Asian Buffaloes. Related
to this, the role of doubtful FMD vaccines have to be
investigated.
It is likely that the new A/IRN/2005 sublineage persists or
low- level circulates subclinically within the Asian Buffaloes and thereby the further opportunity for both accumulation of genetic variation and recombination due to
multiple infections by different serotypes is given.

Methods
Virus isolates
Virus isolates have been collected as a part of a larger study
and the sampling strategy is described there [7].

Nine mouth epithelium samples (EF494480, EF494481,
EF494482, EF494483, EF494484, EF494485, EF494487,
EF494488, EF494437) have been collected in Karachi,
South Pakistan. FMDV from three of these epithelium
samples (EF494487, EF494488, EF494437) have been
propagated in primary cultures of calf kidney cells for
three passages, the other six were directly sequenced from
the sample. In addition, we collected thirty-four mouth
swabs from subclinically infected and animals (EF494446
– EF494479). The IAH, Pirbright, provided us with cell
culture propagated virus from the first recognized outbreak in Turkey (Turkey (WRL)).
RNA extraction, reverse transcriptase – PCR and cycle
sequencing
Tissue (100–150 mg) was homogenized in 1 ml RNApro™
Solution (Qbiogene, USA) in a Lysing Matrix D tube
(Qbiogene, Inc., USA) using a FP 120 Fast Prep™ Cell Dis-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/122

ruptor (Qbiogene, USA). Total RNA was extracted using
RNeasy-Mini Kit™ (Qiagen, Germany) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA from mouth
swabs and cell culture propagated virus was extracted
using QIAamp RNA Blood Mini Kit™ (Qiagen, Germany).
cDNA synthesis was done using Ready-To-Go™ You-Prime
First-Strand Beads (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Sweden),
employing the primers NV27T and random hexamers
pdN6.
Five μl of the template cDNA were added to 45 μl of the
PCR reaction mixture containing 0.2 μM primers (see
Additional file 4), 200 μM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and
dTTP, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM
MgCl2 and 1 U of AmpliTaq® Gold DNA polymerase
(Applied Biosystems, UK). DNA was amplified with a
DNA Thermal Cycler PE9700 (Perkin Elmer) by a twostep cycling reaction as follows: 95°C for 15 min, and five
cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 59°C for 2 min and 72°C for 30
sec, and then 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 61°C for 30 sec
and 72°C for 30 sec, followed by a final extension step of
72°C for 10 min.
The resulting PCR products were examined by electrophoresis, using a 1,2% agarose gel, with a separation time
of 1.5 hours at 6.5 V/cm.
Amplicons were visualised with ethidium bromide and
subsequently extracted and purified from the agarose gel
with QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany).
Cycle-sequencing of the overlapping amplicons was then
performed by Agowa GmbH, Germany.
Multiple alignment
Sequence assembling was performed with ContigExpress
(VectorNTI©-software) and multiple alignment was performed by log-expectation comparison, using the MUSCLE (v.3.6) software [17].
Phylogenetic analysis
Models of evolution were determined by hierarchical
Likelihood-Ratio test of 24 substitution models, using the
programs PAUP*(v. 10) and MrModeltest (v. 2.2) [18].

The GTR+G was used and Bayesian analysis was performed using MrBayes (v3.2) [19] with the following settings. The maximum likelihood model employed 6
substitution types ("nst = 6"), with base frequencies set to
variable values ("statefreqpr = dirichlet(1,1,1,1)"). Rate
variation across sites was modeled using a gamma distribution (rates = "invgamma"). The Markov chain Monte
Carlo search was run with 4 chains for 500000 generations, with trees being sampled every 100 generations (the
first 1000 trees were discarded as "burnin").
