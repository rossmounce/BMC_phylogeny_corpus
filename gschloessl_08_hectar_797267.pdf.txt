Abstract
Background: The heterokonts are a particularly interesting group of eukaryotic organisms; they
include many key species of planktonic and coastal algae and several important pathogens. To
understand the biology of these organisms, it is necessary to be able to predict the subcellular
localisation of their proteins but this is not straightforward, particularly in photosynthetic
heterokonts which possess a complex chloroplast, acquired as the result of a secondary
endosymbiosis. This is because the bipartite target peptides that deliver proteins to these
chloroplasts can be easily confused with the signal peptides of secreted proteins, causing currently
available algorithms to make erroneous predictions. HECTAR, a subcellular targeting prediction
method which takes into account the specific properties of heterokont proteins, has been
developed to address this problem.
Results: HECTAR is a statistical prediction method designed to assign proteins to five different
categories of subcellular targeting: Signal peptides, type II signal anchors, chloroplast transit
peptides, mitochondrion transit peptides and proteins which do not possess any N-terminal target
peptide. The recognition rate of HECTAR is 96.3%, with Matthews correlation coefficients ranging
from 0.67 to 0.95. The method is based on a hierarchical architecture which implements the divide
and conquer approach to identify the different possible target peptides one at a time. At each node
of the hierarchy, the most relevant outputs of various existing subcellular prediction methods are
combined by a Support Vector Machine.
Conclusion: The HECTAR method is able to predict the subcellular localisation of heterokont
proteins with high accuracy. It also efficiently predicts the subcellular localisation of proteins from
cryptophytes, a group that is phylogenetically close to the heterokonts. A variant of HECTAR,
called HECTARSEC, can be used to identify signal peptide and type II signal anchor sequences in
proteins from any eukaryotic organism. Both HECTAR and HECTARSEC are available as a web
application at the following address: http://www.sb-roscoff.fr/hectar/.

Background
Many cellular processes depend on proteins being targeted to specific subcellular localisations. As a result,

information about the subcellular localisation of a protein can provide important insights into its function. Conversely, knowledge about which proteins are targeted to a

specific subcellular localisation can lead to a better understanding of the functions of a particular compartment of
the cell. This can be particularly interesting in an evolutionary context. For example, mitochondria and chloroplasts have evolved from being enslaved organisms,
engulfed by a host cell, to become specialised cellular
compartments integrated into the functioning of the host
cell [1,2]. Identification of proteins that are targeted to
these organelles can provide clues as to how these
organelles evolved.
A large variety of methods have been developed to predict
the subcellular localisation of nuclear encoded proteins.
Pattern recognition methods which have been most
favoured are Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) [3-5], Neural Networks (NNs) [6-8] and Support Vector Machines
(SVMs) [9-12]. Bayesian methods [13] and fuzzy k-nearest
neighbour algorithms [14], linear discriminant analysis
(LDA) [15], position weight matrices [16] and rule based
systems [17] have also been proposed. All subcellular
localisation prediction methods use various approaches
to interpret the intrinsic information present in protein
sequences. The composition of amino acids within the
polypeptide sequence or the composition of peptide
sequences of fixed length (n-gram) [13,14], sequence profiles [10], physio-chemical parameters like hydrophobicity, charged residues and isoelectric points as well as
details about the secondary structure like amphiphilic
alpha helices, membrane regions and the orientation of
N- and C-terminal ends are taken into account
[3,5,15,17].
The majority of subcellular prediction programs search for
N-terminal targeting peptides since these sequences are
common in proteomes [18-20].
The heterokonts are a diverse evolutionary group that
includes diatoms, brown algae, and oomycete plant pathogens such as potato late blight [21]. The plastids of the
photosynthetic members of this group are thought to be
derived from a secondary endosymbiotic event involving
a red alga and a eukaryotic heterotroph (Fig. 1). The
enslavement of the endosymbiont involved alterations to
its structure and most of the endosymbiont's genes were
transfered to the host nucleus or lost [22,23]. As a result,
present day heterokonts possess plastids with a complex
structure. These organelles are surrounded by four concentric membranes and the nuclear-encoded proteins that
function in these plastids have to be transported into the
organelle through these four membranes. This is mediated by bipartite, N-terminal targeting sequences consisting of a leading signal peptide followed by a chloroplast
transit peptide (Fig. 2). Kilian and Kroth [24] have identified a conserved motif (ASAFAP) at the cleavage site of the
signal peptide in heterokont plastid targeted proteins.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/393

This motif includes the alanine (A) residues at positions 1 and -3 relative to the cleavage site that are commonly
found in all signal peptides [25]. The phenylalanine (F)
residue just after the cleavage site is highly conserved, it
occurs in almost all heterokont chloroplast targeted proteins, being only rarely replaced by tryptophan, tyrosine
or leucine [26]. The ASAFAP motif was shown to be essential for import into the plastid in experiments that
involved transforming the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum with constructs encoding modified plastid target peptides fused to green fluorescent proteins (GFP) [24,26].
We show here that the unusual structure of heterokont
plastid targeting sequences causes problems for currently
available subcellular prediction methods that have been
designed to predict the subcellular localisations of proteins from other eukaryotic groups such as animals, fungi
and green plants. To overcome this difficulty, we have created a new method that is specifically designed to predict
the subcellular localisation of heterokont proteins.

Results and discussion
Shortcomings of existing prediction tools when applied to
heterokont chloroplast targeted proteins
To determine how well existing subcellular localisation
prediction methods perform on chloroplast targeted proteins from heterokonts, we submitted 55 experimentally
verified sequences (see Methods for details) to four widely
used subcellular prediction methods: TargetP [8] (v. 1.1),
Predotar [6] (v. 1.03), PredSL [27] (v. 2005) and iPsort
[17] (v. 2002). These methods assign proteins to one of
four different subcellular localisations: the secretory pathway, based on the presence of a signal peptide, the chloroplast or the mitochondrion, based on the presence of
the respective transit peptides, or to none of these three
localisations, based on the absence of a detectable N-terminal targeting sequence. As expected, these prediction
methods erroneously assigned a significant proportion of
the chloroplast proteins to the secretory pathway (see
Table 1). In addition, Predotar failed to detect the presence of a target peptide in a significant number of proteins, and some proteins were falsely predicted as being
targeted to the mitochondrion by three of the four methods. In contrast, we were able to show that the signal peptide component of the bipartite chloroplast targeting
sequences was efficiently recognised by methods that have
been developed to specifically distinguish proteins with
signal peptides (designed for the secretory pathway) from
non-secreted proteins. The four methods tested, Phobius
[3] (v. 1.01), PrediSi [16] (v. 2003) and both the Neural
Network and Hidden Markov Model versions of SignalP
[7] (v. 3.0) (SignalP_NN and SignalP_HMM), identified
the signal peptide component of 55, 48, 53 and 55 of the
55 heterokont chloroplast proteins, respectively. Based on
this result, we decided to create a method that would be

Primary 1 secondary endosymbiosis
Primary and secondary endosymbiosis. part A: Primary endosymbiosis is proposed to have involved the capture of a
cyanobacterium (green elipse) by a eukaryotic heterotroph (red elipse). The cyanobacterium would then have been modified
during evolution to give rise to a plastid with two surrounding membranes. part B: The secondary endosymbiotic event that
gave rise to the heterokonts is proposed to have involved the engulfment of a red algae with a chloroplast (green elipse inside
a red elipse) by a eukaryotic heterotroph (brown elipse). The red alga would have become the heterokont plastid with four
surrounding membranes.

able to efficiently recognise the bipartite chloroplast targeting sequences of heterokonts by searching for each of
the two components of this structure in a step by step
manner.
A hierarchical procedure to recognise heterokont
chloroplast targeting sequences
The HEterokont subCellular localisation TARgeting
method (HECTAR) has a hierarchical architecture consisting of three decision modules (Fig. 3). Each module is
dedicated to the identification of one or two specific Nterminal target peptides. Altogether, four target peptides
can be predicted: signal peptides, type II signal anchors,
chloroplast transit peptides and mitochondrion transit

peptides. The absence of any detectable target peptide represents a fifth category. The decision module at the root of
HECTAR (the "signal peptide/anchor" module) differs
from the two other modules in that it discriminates
between three categories: N-terminal signal peptides, type
II signal anchors and proteins without either of these target peptides. Type II signal anchors resemble secretory signal peptides but have a longer N-terminal hydrophobic
region which is able to span the membrane. Type II signal
anchors are not cleaved. Their function is to anchor proteins in the membrane. The N-terminus of a type II signal
anchor protein is located in the cytoplasm (Nin) whilst the
C-terminus projects into the lumen of the endoplasmic
reticulum or is on the outside of the cell (Cout) [28,29].

Comparison of the chloroplast target peptides of red algae and heterokonts
Figure 2
Comparison of the chloroplast target peptides of red algae and heterokonts. part A: To be imported into a red
algal chloroplast, proteins require only a single N-terminal transit peptide (blue bar). The transit peptide is cleaved when the
protein passes through the outer chloroplast membrane. The mature protein (yellow) is then transferred into the chloroplast.
part B: In heterokonts, proteins which are targeted to the chloroplast possess a bipartite target peptide which is made up of
an N-terminal signal peptide (red) followed by a chloroplast transit peptide (blue). The signal peptide is cleaved when the protein passes through the outermost of the four heterokont chloroplast membranes. This places the transit peptide at the new
N-terminus of the protein where it can mediate transfer across the two innermost membranes. The transit peptide is cleaved
during this second step of the transfer. part C: Sequence logo of the conserved ASAFAP motif surrounding the predicted signal peptide cleavage site based on 55 chloroplast targeted proteins from heterokonts. The logo was built with WebLogo [53]
and is based on manually improved alignments of the sequence neighbouring the predicted cleavage site.
The first decision module of HECTAR identifies signal
peptides and type II signal anchors by combining the predictions of Phobius, PrediSi, SignalP_NN and
SignalP_HMM. HMMTOP [30] (v. 2.1) and TMHMM [4]
(v. 2.0c) can detect the long hydrophobic regions which
characterise signal anchors and were therefore also incorporated into the decision process. If HECTAR predicts a
type II signal anchor, the category for this protein has
been found. Otherwise, if a signal peptide is detected, the
protein is further analysed to determine whether the signal peptide is a component of a chloroplast targeting

sequence. To do this, HECTAR first searches for the ASAFAP motif around the predicted signal peptide cleavage
site (see Methods for details). HECTAR then cleaves the
signal peptide based on the signal peptide cleavage site
predicted by Phobius, PrediSi, SignalP_NN and
SignalP_HMM. The truncated protein sequence, lacking
the signal peptide, is then analysed by the "chloroplast
targeted" module which determines whether a chloroplast
transit peptide is present at what is now the N-terminal
end of the protein sequence. The chloroplast targeted
module combines the calculated score for the appearance

The subcellular localisation predicting algorithms TargetP, Predotar, PredSL and iPsort were used to analyse 55 heterokont chloroplast targeted
proteins. For TargetP we declared a protein as possessing no N-terminal target peptide if the highest category support probability was less than
0.32.

of the ASAFAP motif with the output of the plant versions
of Predotar, iPsort and PredSL. Initially, we also considered integrating ChloroP [31] (v. 1.1) into this module.
However, this method predicted a chloroplast localisation
for many secreted proteins after the leading signal peptide
had been removed (data not shown). If a chloroplast transit peptide is detected by the "chloroplast targeted" module, the protein is classified as being chloroplastic,
otherwise it is labelled as being part of the secreted pathway. Going back to the root of the hierarchy, if no signal
peptide/anchor is detected at this level, the protein
sequence is fed to the module that identifies mitochondrion targeted proteins. This module combines the predictions of MitoProt2 [15] (v. 1.101) and the non-plant
versions of TargetP, Predotar, iPsort and PredSL. If a mitochondrion targeting sequence is detected, the protein is
classified as mitochondrial, otherwise, it is assigned to the
default category "no N-terminal target peptide", indicating that it is located in the cytosol or subcellular compartments where protein targeting does not require a Nterminal target peptide.
Use of support vector machines as an ensemble method for
detecting target peptides
Since the early sixties, and more precisely since the work
of Bates and Granger [32,33], model combination has
proved to be an efficient alternative to model selection for
a wide range of statistical inference problems. Theory in
the field has made rapid strides, first in the framework of
regression, and more recently in discrimination. The success of methods such as bagging [34] and boosting [35] has
highlighted the usefulness of implementing large margin
ensemble methods to improve the performance of weak
classifiers. As mentioned above, programs that predict the
subcellular localisations of proteins are based on different
principles, and therefore provide complementary information (i.e., their errors are not too correlated). This is
why HECTAR was designed to combine the output of
selected prediction methods at each node of the hierarchy
(Fig. 3). We chose to use SVMs for this task. This choice
was based on the usefulness of large margin models to
combine classifiers, and on the fact that SVMs have
already proved very efficient to combine prediction meth-

ods in the field of protein sequence processing (see for
instance [36,37]). The "signal peptide/anchor" module
discriminates between three categories. For this module,
the multi-class SVM (M-SVM) of Weston and Watkins was
used [38]. The kernel of the SVMs incorporated in the "signal peptide/anchor" module and the "mitochondrion targeted" module is a Radial Basis Function (RBF), the one
for the "chloroplast targeted" module is linear. This
choice was based on preliminary test results (data not
shown). For each of the three SVMs, an optimal subset of
the outputs of the base classifiers was selected to constitute the set of predictors. This selection was performed
based on the biological significance of the outputs.
Assessment of the prediction accuracy of HECTAR
A set of reference proteins was established for each of the
five categories of subcellular targeting predicted by HECTAR (see Methods for details). The entire set comprised
441 secretory path proteins, 11 type II signal anchor proteins, 55 heterokont chloroplast targeted proteins, 128
mitochondrion targeted proteins and 1423 nuclear/
cytosolic proteins. A five-fold cross-validation procedure
was applied to this set to assess the prediction accuracy
according to two criteria: the recognition rate and the
Pearson's/Matthews' correlation coefficients (MCC) [39].

In our data set, the proportions of type II signal anchor
proteins, chloroplast targeted proteins and mitochondrion targeted proteins are 0.5%, 2.7% and 6.2% respectively. This implies that the training sets of the three SVMs
are highly unbalanced, which could a priori have a negative influence on the accuracy of the prediction. Based on
this observation, we decided to assess the usefulness of
reducing the number of negative examples in the different
training sets.
To identify the optimal ratios of examples from the largest
categories in the training sets of the three SVMs, we introduced a second level of cross-validation (applied a stacked
generalization procedure [40]). The criterion optimized
was the MCC (in the case of M-SVM we used the sum of
the three coefficients). In these procedures, sampling
without replacement was used to select a number of exam-

Figure 3
Hierarchical architecture of HECTAR
Hierarchical architecture of HECTAR. Five categories of subcellar targeting can be predicted by the HECTAR method:
signal peptides, type II signal anchors, chloroplast transit peptides, mitochondrion transit peptides and proteins with no detectable N-terminal target peptide. Each decision module (yellow boxes) runs several selected methods (white boxes) to detect
specific target peptides. Selected outputs from these methods are then submitted to a SVM which combines these predictors
to determine whether a particular target peptide is present in the sequence being analysed. Protein sequences are first analysed by the "signal peptide/anchor" module where a multi-class SVM determines whether a signal peptide or a type II signal
anchor is present. If a signal peptide is detected, this sequence is removed from the N-terminal end of the protein sequence
and the modified sequence is analysed by the "chloroplast targeted" module which determines whether the signal peptide is followed by a chloroplast transit peptide. In this module the result of a search for the ASAFAP motif is included in the decision
process. If a chloroplast transit peptide is present the protein is classified as chloroplastic, otherwise it is classified as having
either a signal peptide or a type II signal anchor. When the "signal peptide/anchor" module did not predict either a signal peptide or a type II signal anchor, the protein sequence is analysed by the "mitochondrion targeted" module to determine whether
a potential mitochondrion target peptide is present. If a mitochondrion target peptide is found, the protein is assigned as being
targeted to the mitochondrion, otherwise it is classified as having no N-terminal target peptide.

ples from the two larger sets ranging from the number of
examples of the smallest category to its maximum possible value (i.e., all examples of the large sets being
retained). For each SVM and each value of the ratio, five
different sets of negative examples were sampled. It
appeared that the prediction accuracy was systematically
increasing with the size of the training set. As a conse-

quence, no example was discarded in any of the training
sets of the five-fold cross-validation.
Table 2 presents the confusion matrix resulting from this
procedure. The overall recognition rate exceeds 96.3%,
with Matthews' correlation coefficients equal to 0.94 (signal peptide possessing proteins), 0.67 (type II signal

Additional testing of HECTAR using proteins with known
subcellular localisations
We established an additional set of proteins whose experimentally-determined subcellular localisations corresponded to one of the five categories predicted by
HECTAR. This data set included one mitochondrion targeted protein, the TIM50 subunit protein from Phytophthora infestans, and a number of proteins of the
cryptophyte Guillardia theta. Cryptophytes are a sister
group to the heterokonts, and they are also believed to be
derived from a secondary endosymbiosis event involving
a red alga [21,22]. Like heterokonts, cryptophytes possess
complex chloroplasts and chloroplast targeting is mediated by a bipartite target peptide consisting of an N-terminal signal peptide followed by a chloroplast transit
peptide. Chryptophyte chloroplast targeting peptides possess an ASAFAP-like motif (AXAF), with a highly conserved phenylalanine, at the signal peptide cleavage site
[41]. Ten cryptophyte proteins that have been shown
experimentally to be targeted to different subcellular
localisations were analysed by HECTAR. These included
one cytosolic, three secreted proteins and two categories
of chloroplast targeted proteins. The first were proteins
that are targeted to the interior of the cryptophyte chloro-

plast (three proteins) whereas the second corresponded to
proteins that are targeted to the periplastid space between
the second and third (outermost) chloroplast membranes
(three proteins) [22,42]. Proteins targeted to the periplastid space possess a bipartite target peptide but they do
not have a conserved phenylalanine after the signal peptide cleavage site. It has been demonstrated that this phenylalanine residue is essential for a protein to be
transported further into the chloroplast [41]. Table 3
shows that HECTAR successfully identified the presence
of signal peptides in the proteins that enter the secretory
pathway. It also correctly predicted the subcellular localisation of the mitochondrial proteins, the cytosolic protein
and the proteins that are targeted into the interior of the
cryptophyte chloroplast. The proteins that are targeted to
the periplastid space of the cryptophyte chloroplast were
predicted to be either secreted or chloroplastic. This is not
surprising because HECTAR has not been designed to
identify this class of targeting sequence. This analysis confirmed the reliability of the predictions produced by HECTAR and demonstrated that it can also accurately predict
the subcellular localisation of proteins from organisms
such as the cryptophytes that belong to groups other than
the heterokonts but possess complex plastids derived
from a secondary endosymbiosis event.

Analysis of putative Fucus distichus secreted proteins using
HECTAR
Belanger et al. [43] used a yeast signal sequence trap (SST)
screen to identify secreted proteins potentially involved in
asymmetric zygote cell growth in the brown alga Fucus distichus. The putative secreted proteins identified in this
study included several probable chloroplast proteins such
as fucoxanthin a/c-binding binding proteins (FCP) and
the authors suggested that these may have been bona fide
chloroplast proteins that were recognised by the yeast
secretion machinery as secreted proteins due to their Nterminal signal peptide. To test whether HECTAR could
distinguish between the secreted and the chloroplast proteins in this data set, we selected the protein sequences
that were at least 100 residues long and applied a redundancy reduction (for details see Methods). The remaining
47 F. distichus putative secreted proteins were analysed by
HECTAR. Of the 47 proteins, 45 were predicted to possess
a N-terminal signal peptide (see Table 4). No target peptide was found in two of the proteins (BU037984 and
BU038066). The SST procedure has been shown to select
a small percentage of non-secreted proteins as false positives [44]. This occurs because these proteins possess a
short region that shares some similarity with signal peptides at their N-terminal end. BU037984 and BU038066
may belong to this category. The analysis by HECTAR suggested that nine of the 45 proteins with a signal peptide
also possessed a chloroplast transit peptide, indicating
that these proteins are targeted to the chloroplast. Comparison with the Genbank non-redundant protein database (NR) using BlastP allowed putative functions to be
assigned to 23 of the 47 Fucus proteins (see Table 4).
BlastP searches with the other 24 proteins either returned
matches with proteins of unknown function or did not
find any matches in the database. Additional searches
were carried out against published heterokont genomes,
and using the Pfam database, but no additional functional information was obtained for these proteins (data
not shown). The putative functions of the 23 proteins
which matched proteins with functional information in
the database were consistent with the subcellular localisations predicted by HECTAR.
HECTARSEC
HECTAR has been designed to predict the subcellular
localisation of heterokont proteins. As a result, it cannot
be used to determine the subcellular localisation of proteins from green plants because their chloroplast targeting
peptides consist of a single unit, the chloroplast transit
peptide. However, because signal peptides and type II signal anchors have a similar composition in all eukaryotes
[25,28] and HECTAR has been trained on target peptides
from across the eukaryotic tree, the "signal peptide/
anchor" module can be used to identify these two types of
target peptides in a protein from any eukaryotic organism.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/393

We call this version of HECTAR, consisting of only the
"signal peptide/anchor" module, HECTARSEC (Fig. 4). A
five-fold cross-validation of HECTARSEC showed that it
predicted the presence of signal peptides and type II signal
anchors with a high (98.4%) accuracy and that with
MCCs of 0.96 (signal peptide), 0.67 (type II signal
anchor) and 0.96 (no signal peptide or signal anchor) (for
details see Table 5).

Conclusion
To date, complete genome sequences have been published for three heterokonts: The diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana [45] and two oomycete plant pathogens [46]. In
addition, genome sequencing has been completed or is
nearing completion for several other heterokont species,
including the diatoms Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Fragilariopsis cylindrus and Pseudo-nitzschia, the oomycetes Phytophthora infestans and Phytophthora capsici, the
pelagophyte Aureococcus anophagefferens, the chrysophyte
Ochromonas danica and the brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus. This rapidly increasing availability of sequence data
for the heterokonts brings with it a need for specialised
bioinformatics tools to identify genes and to make predictions about the characteristics of the encoded proteins.
HECTAR addresses one aspect of this problem, the prediction of the subcellular localisation of heterokont proteins.
We have shown that HECTAR fulfills this function with
high efficiency using cross-validation and by further tests
with additional proteins from several species including
the cryptophyte Guillardia theta and the brown alga Fucus
distichus.
In its present form, HECTAR can discriminate between
four types of target peptides. However, because of its modular architecture, it could easily be adapted in the future to
identify additional types of target peptides. These could
include sequences that direct proteins to more precisely
defined subcellular compartments (such as the signals
that allow targeting to the chloroplast thylakoid membrane or the mitochondrial matrix, for example) or
regions within the protein sequence such as membranespanning domains or nuclear localisation signals.

Methods
Data sets of proteins with experimentally verified
subcellular localisations
The protein sequences that were used to train and test
HECTAR were obtained either from Swiss-Prot or by
searching the scientific literature. The latter method was
particularly important for identifying heterokont proteins
because of the small number of sequences that have been
analysed experimentally for this group of organisms. The
Swiss-Prot database (release 54.3) was searched with the
Sequence Retrieval System (SRS version 7.1.3.2) at the EBI
webpage for entries with the comment type (CC) "subcel-

removed. Using this general approach, mitochondrial
proteins were retrieved by searching for the subcellular

table entries "TRANSIT" (FtKey) and "mitochondrion"
(FtDescription). Nuclear/cytosolic proteins were recovered by searching for "nucleus" or "cytoplasm" in the CC
field. Secreted proteins were identified by searching for
the feature table key "SIGNAL". After removal of nonvalid proteins as described above, we retained 167 mitochondrial targeted, 2330 nuclear/cytosolic and 977

secreted proteins. Searches of the scientific literature concentrated on the identification of two classes of protein:
proteins with a type II signal anchor and chloroplast targeted proteins from heterokonts. Proteins with type II signal anchors were only accepted if they had been shown
experimentally to be anchored in the cell membrane. We
also verified that the N-terminus of the proteins had been
shown to be orientated towards the cytosol (Nin), and the
C-terminus to be located either in the lumen of a subcellular compartment (of the secretory pathway) or on the

outside of the cell (Cout). For the latter, glycosolation of
the C-terminal part of the protein was accepted as evidence of a luminal/extracellular location for this part of
the protein. Proteins with more than one transmembrane
spanning region were eliminated. Eleven type II signal
anchor proteins were found in this way.

idues neighbouring the signal peptide cleavage site
(positions -3 to +3):

To identify experimentally verified heterokont chloroplast
targeted proteins, we searched for evidence based either
on the uptake of GFP or red fluorescent protein (RFP)
fusion proteins into heterokont chloroplasts, on the
import of proteins into canine microsomes (to validate
the N-terminal signal peptide) or on screening of libraries
with antibodies against FCP. For some of the heterokont
chloroplast targeted proteins, conservation of targeting
sequences in a multiple alignment was also accepted as
proof. A collection of 62 manually curated chloroplast
proteins from the diatoms Thalassiosira pseudonana and
Phaeodactylum tricornutum constituted the major part of
the heterokont chloroplast data set. These sequences were
kindly provided by Peter Kroth (University of Konstanz,
Germany). Together with additional chloroplast targeted
proteins from diatoms, brown algae and raphidophytes,
the heterokont chloroplast protein data set totaled 72 proteins.

where {aj: 1 ≤ j ≤ 20} is the set of the 20 natural amino
acids and f(xi = aj) is the frequency of amino acid aj at position i within the ASAFAP motif with i ∈ {-3, -2, -1, +1, +2,
+3}.

We implemented a redundancy reduction pipeline to
remove redundant data from the above data sets. For this,
ClustalW was modified so that it provided a pairwise distance matrix. This information was then fed to an in house
implementation of the Hobohm2 algorithm [47]. The
redundancy reduction was applied individually to each of
the data sets corresponding to the five categories of subcellular targeting. A protein sequence was defined as nonredundant if its 100 N-terminal residues showed a
sequence identity of less than 35% with the other proteins
of the same reference set. After redundant sequences had
been removed, the final data sets included 128 mitochondrial targeted proteins, 1423 nuclear/cytosolic proteins,
441 secreted proteins, 11 type II signal anchor proteins
and 55 heterokont chloroplast targeted proteins.
ASAFAP motif search
To develop a search procedure for the conserved motif
identified in [24], we applied the signal peptide prediction algorithms (SignalP_NN, SignalP_HMM, Phobius
and PrediSi) to the 55 proteins of the heterokont chloroplast data set and aligned these proteins at their predicted
signal peptide cleavage sites. In rare cases where the prediction methods did not agree on the cleavage site position for an individual protein, we searched the sequence
surrounding the predicted cleavage sites for traces of the
ASAFAP motif and the alignment was then manually
improved with respect to the conserved motif. The Shannon entropy [48]Sobs,i was evaluated for each of the six res-

20

S obs ,i = −

∑ f (x

i

= a j ) log 2( f ( x i = a j )),

j =1

By Schneider [49] the information content Rseq,i which
describes the conservation of the residue at position i of a
protein sequence is:
Rseq,i = Smax - Sobs,i = log2 (20) - Sobs,i,
where Smax is the maximum possible entropy.
To search for the ASAFAP motif, HECTAR scans from the
N-terminal end of a protein sequence as far as the 20 first
residues after the predicted signal peptide cleavage site
using a six-residue sliding window. A score is computed
for each window. This score represents the similarity of
each window content to the consensus motif. For this the
amino acid frequencies and the information content for
each position of the ASAFAP motif retrieved in the above
mentioned procedure are taken into account. It is given
by:
k +5

score(w k ) =

∑ f (x )R
i

seq ,i ,

i=k

where wk is the content of the six-residue window starting
at position k of the protein sequence. The best score for a
protein is then transmitted to the chloroplast targeting
module of HECTAR where it contributes to the detection
of putative chloroplast targeted proteins.
SVM classifiers
We have seen that HECTAR uses three SVMs as combiners:
a M-SVM and two bi-class SVMs. We used our software,
which implements the M-SVM of Weston and Watkins
and is dedicated to very large data sets [37], to develop all
three machines. This software is available at the following
address: http://www.loria.fr/~guermeur/Dev.tar.gz. This
approach could be used since the M-SVM is identical to
the bi-class SVM when applied to compute dichotomies.
The kernels of the M-SVM ("signal peptide/anchor" module) and the bi-class SVM of the "mitochondrion targeted"
module are RBF (Gaussian), whereas the kernel of the biclass SVM of the "chloroplast targeted" module is linear.
As a consequence, for the SVMs of the "signal peptide/
anchor" module and the "mitochondrion targeted" mod-

ule, model selection consisted of choosing the bandwidth
of the kernel and the value of the soft margin parameter C,
whereas for the "chloroplast targeted" module SVM, only
the value of C had to be set. To peform this task, we studied the way guaranteed risks varied as a function of the
values of these hyperparameters. The optimization procedure corresponding to C made use of the algorithm proposed in [50] to fit the entire regularization path. This
allowed us to spare cpu time. In the bi-class case, the guaranteed risk used was the standard bound on the expected
risk of kernel machines involving their Rademacher complexity (see [51], Section 3 for details). For the M-SVM, we
used the multi-class extension of this bound established
in Chapter 2 of [52]. Bounds were used for model selection in place of an additional cross-validation procedure
for two reasons. The first was to keep as many examples as
possible for training, given the fact that the size of some
sets, such as the type II signal anchor proteins, is rather
small. The second reason was to avoid complexifying the
cross-validation procedure implemented to assess the
generalization performance of HECTAR.
