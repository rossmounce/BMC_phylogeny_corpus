Abstract
Background: The Atlantic rainforest ecosystem, where bromeliads are abundant, provides an
excellent environment for Kerteszia species, because these anophelines use the axils of those plants
as larval habitat. Anopheles (K.) cruzii and Anopheles (K.) bellator are considered the primary vectors
of malaria in the Atlantic forest. Although the incidence of malaria has declined in some areas of
the Atlantic forest, autochthonous cases are still registered every year, with Anopheles cruzii being
considered to be a primary vector of both human and simian Plasmodium.
Methods: Recent publications that addressed ecological aspects that are important for
understanding the involvement of Kerteszia species in the epidemiology of malaria in the Atlantic
rainforest in the Neotropical Region were analysed.
Conclusion: The current state of knowledge about Kerteszia species in relation to the Atlantic
rainforest ecosystem was discussed. Emphasis was placed on ecological characteristics related to
epidemiological aspects of this group of mosquitoes. The main objective was to investigate
biological aspects of the species that should be given priority in future studies.

Background
The Atlantic rainforest originally stretched as a continuous
domain from northeastern to southern Brazil, northern
Argentina and southeastern Paraguay. The forest occupied
a narrow coastal area in northeastern Brazil, but in some
parts of the state of São Paulo, it extended from the coast
to as far as 200 miles inland [1].
Deforestation started during the colonization of Brazil in
the XVI century. As a result, most of the forest has been

cleared, and currently less than 7.6% of its original
1,306,000 km2 cover remains, but is highly fragmented.
The forest domain persists in a relatively continuous area
in mountainous regions and as small fragments in regions
with a smooth topography, which are generally used for
agriculture [2].
Apart from cases of Anopheles neivai reported in the Amazon region and Iguassu Park, where Anopheles cruzii can
also be found [3], the geographic domain of Kerteszia spePage 1 of 8

cies is restricted to those areas of the Serra do Mar mountains that remain covered with the exuberant Atlantic
forest. The humid and rainy climate, together with the
rocks and soil, support several species of bromeliads.
Since the subgenus was described, the association
between Kerteszia immature stages and bromeliads has
been observed by various authors. Anopheles bambusicolus
is the only species that uses bamboo as larval habitat. The
massive presence of bromeliads in both Serra do Mar
mountains and the coastal plain near this mountain range
is indicative of the occurrence of Kerteszia species. Areas
where Kerteszia species occur are considered risk areas for
Plasmodium transmission.
It is noteworthy that malaria epidemics constituted a challenge to public health authorities in the past [4], mainly
in areas along the Serra do Mar mountain range, from the
south of the state of São Paulo to the state of Santa Catarina. Following the decline in malaria transmission in
these states, the disease now persists at low endemic level
and the transmission area has extended to the northeast
Brazil. Currently, few malaria cases have been notified. In
the state of Espírito Santo, malaria continues to be a concern to epidemiologists and the public health surveillance
service [5].

immature of mosquitoes, including those of the subgenus
Kerteszia.
Zavortink [6] recorded the presence of An. cruzii, An. bellator, Anopheles homunculus, An. bambusicolus and Anopheles
laneanus in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest. Of these species, only An. cruzii and An. bellator are of epidemiological
importance. In agreement, they are the most widespread
species, occurring from southern Brazil to the northeastern limit of the Atlantic rainforest (Figure 1).
According to Forattini [10], the distribution range of An.
cruzii extends from the state of Sergipe to areas of southern
Brazil. Anopheles bellator extends along the northeastern
coast, reaching the state of Amapá, northern South America and Trinidad and Tobago. However, its distribution is
discontinuous (Figure 1). Consoli and Lourenço-deOliveira [11] recorded this species in an area extending
from southern Brazil to the state of Paraíba and in Guyana. The species is currently believed to be distributed in
two areas, one in northern South America and the other in

Previous reviews of the literature on Kerteszia have focused
on systematics and taxonomy [6], simian malaria [7] and
historical aspects [8]. This review was undertaken in view
of the situation described above and the relevance of the
Kerteszia subgenus. It focuses on both the current state of
knowledge and ecological aspects of this taxon. It is hoped
that a critical analysis of the literature and the experience
of those working in this field will help identify which
studies should be given priority in the coming years. The
review covers the following subjects: geographic distribution, taxonomy, habitat, behaviour and the relationship
of Kerteszia species with the transmission and genetic
makeup of malaria parasites. Given that An. cruzii and
Anopheles bellator are involved in the dynamics of Plasmodium transmission in the Atlantic forest domains, these
species are the major focus of this review.
Geographic distribution and habitats
Maps of the geographic distribution of the Kerteszia species generated by Zavortink [6] show that this taxon is
widely distributed throughout the Americas, from Mexico
to southern Brazil. The majority of Kerteszia species occurs
in coastal areas of both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans,
where bromeliads are abundant These belong to the
monocotyledons Bromeliaceae family, that accumulate
water in leaf axils [9]. Hundreds of species of bromeliad
have this characteristic and provide a suitable habitat for

Brazil, where it is associated with the Atlantic forest
domain.
The other species known to occur in the Atlantic forest in
Brazil, are An. homunculus, found in the states of Santa
Catarina, Paraná and São Paulo, and recently registered in
mountain areas of Espírito Santo state (Malafronte et al,
unpublished data) (Figure 1); An. bambusicolus, registered
in the states of Santa Catarina and Paraná; and An. laneanus, which occurs in the states of São Paulo and Rio de
Janeiro, in high altitudes [6,10,11] (Figure 1).
Two other Kerteszia species are known from Brazil, Anopheles neivai recorded from the Amazon region [12], and
Anopheles bolivienses found in Brazil (unspecified localities) [13,14]. Although An. boliviensis had been recorded
from Brazil, the presence of this species has not been registered recently. Further field collections will be necessary
to ascertain the occurrence of An. boliviensis in Brazil.
Habitat studies carried out in mountainous areas close to
the coastal plain in the municipality of Cananéia (state of
São Paulo) reported a higher frequency of An. cruzii than
in lowland areas in the same region [15]. Anopheles bellator
was found on the coastal plain in a sunny "restinga" habitat, while An. cruzii was the most frequent species on the
mountain slopes. In the Serra da Bocaina mountains, in
municipalities located on the border between the states of
Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, An. cruzii was the most
abundant mosquito at high altitudes [16].
Forest with bromeliad cover is a favourable habitat for An.
cruzii. Guimarães et al [3] recorded an isolated population
of An. cruzii in Iguassu National Park, where this species
was found exclusively in preserved areas covered by dense
forest.
Environmental effect
Due to the fact that mosquitoes of the Kerteszia subgenus
are concentrated in exuberant humid forests, where there
is a high density of bromeliads [17], populations of these
species can have an impact effect according to the degradation of the environmental.

Dorvillé [18] analysed the data of twenty Culicidae surveys by employing multivariate statistical procedures to
look for an association between taxon and the extent of
the degradation in the areas where the collections were
made. This author concluded that mosquitoes of the
Kerteszia subgenus can be used as bio indicators and that
their presence reflects the high degree of environmental
preservation.
Because of the association between Kerteszia and bromeliads, Downs and Pittendrigh [19] coined the term brome-

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/6/1/127

liad-malaria to describe malaria transmission vectored by
these mosquitoes and to differentiate it from malaria
transmitted by anophelines of the subgenera Nyssorhynchus and Anopheles, which breed in different water collections. Anopheles cruzii, An. bellator and An. homunculus are
thus known bromeliad-malaria vectors in southern and
southeastern Brazil [14,19-21] (more details, see Plasmodium transmission section).
Bromeliad-malaria was a serious public health problem in
Brazil during the nineteenth century and the first half of
the twentieth century [8]. The close contact between
humans and the Atlantic rainforest led to extensive exposure of humans to mosquito bites and bromeliad-malaria
transmission during those periods. Because bromeliads
require a forest habitat, the deforestation caused by man
has decimated these plants and thus drastically reduced
the number of mosquitoes of this subgenus. This was
observed by Forattini et al [22] in the Ribeira Valley, SP,
when they compared the faunas of primitive forest in the
quaternary plain and transition area with those in an artificially modified environment in the same region. The
control measures implemented in the 1940s, which
included deforestation and elimination of bromeliads,
together with the use of chemical insecticides and antimalarial drugs, resulted in a significant decrease in the
number of malaria cases in the Atlantic forest region
(from 40,000 in 1940 to only 71 in 1982) [23].
However, the Atlantic forest region has became preserved
by environmental legislation and deforestation and elimination of bromeliads have been forbidden. Thus, despite
the control measures that were implemented in the past,
malaria has not been eradicated in southern Brazil. In the
state of São Paulo, autochthonous cases of malaria are
reported every year in the Atlantic Coast region and
Ribeira Valley. In the State of Santa Catarina, Plasmodium
transmission still occurs in some municipalities [24]. The
present situation, in which the malaria parasite and vectors coexist, demands constant surveillance from public
health authorities to prevent epidemic episodes.
Anopheles cruzii was the most frequent anopheline in the
Serra da Cantareira mountains around the city of São
Paulo in the 1960s, where it was demonstrated to be a vector of P. simium. Interestingly, a case of human malaria
that occurred among the participants of the field collections was attributed to the same vector [7,25]. At that time
these authors observed a high prevalence of this species in
the canopy level of the forest. It is worth noting that Montes [26] studied the same forest, using CDC traps and dry
ice in the canopy twelve meters from the ground at twoweek intervals for one year, and failed to capture a single
sample of this species. This suggests that the species may
have been eliminated from the area. The authors ques-

Malaria Journal 2007, 6:127

tioned whether this was indeed the case and, if it was,
what the reason for the disappearance of the species might
have been. They hypothesised that the species might have
disappeared because forest environmental in the Serra da
Cantareira had suffered an intensive and constant human
interference. Another possibility is that the elimination of
the species was caused by the atmospheric pollution,
which produces acid rain in the greater São Paulo. This
phenomenon could have contaminated the bromeliads,
making them unsuitable as habitat for the immatures of
Kerteszia.
Acrodendrophily
An. cruzii is significantly more active in the uppermost
branchy layer of the forest than at ground level. In a
review of simian malaria, Deane [7] reported that populations of An. cruzii from different locations were noticeably
active in the canopy. According to Deane, in the Serra da
Cantareira mountains on the outskirts of the city of São
Paulo, where Plasmodium simium transmission to monkeys and humans were registered, An. cruzii constituted
94% of the total number of anophelines, and 99% were
collected in the forest canopy.

Acrodendrophily of An. cruzii was confirmed in a study
focusing on the vertical distribution of this species in the
forest of the Serra dos Órgãos National Park, in the state
of Rio de Janeiro [27]. Eighty-five percent of An. cruzii
were captured on a 10-meter-high platform, and the
remaining 15% collected at ground level.
Reproductive isolation between the canopy and groundlevel populations was suspected by Deane et al [28]. To
test this hypothesis, the authors performed a markrelease-recapture experiment to determine whether the
mosquitoes shared the different levels of the forest. The
experiment showed that there was only one population
and that the mosquitoes flew between both levels.
Biting activities
The females of the Kerteszia subgenus blood feed continuously during diurnal hours, mainly inside humid forests.
According to Forattini et al [22], two peaks of activity can
be identified: a high peak associated with the sunset and a
secondary peak associated with sunrise, while Tubaki et al
[29] described a night-time peak of activity for An. cruzii
in Peruíbe, state of São Paulo.

Kerteszia populations in southern and southeastern Brazil
have seasonal activity patterns defined by the climate, in
particular the rainfall and temperature [29,30]. Thus, in
hot and rainy seasons, which usually occur in the summer, the mosquito population density increases, while it
decreases during the dry season and at lower temperatures
[17]. However, there is no interruption in mosquito activ-

ity during the year. Forattini et al [15] observed in a primary forest in the Ribeira Valley that An. cruzii was active
throughout the year, even in periods when species density
was low.
Studies performed in well-preserved forest areas located
near human modified areas showed that there is high
affinity between Kerteszia mosquitoes and human beings.
In a study carried out on the São Paulo State coast, Forattini et al [31] reported a high frequency of An. cruzii in the
forest, while An. bellator was more abundant in the
domestic environment. In the same study, An. bellator was
found to have more endophagic and endophilic behaviour than An. cruzii.
The synanthropy of Kerteszia species was investigated in
an island in the south of the state of São Paulo, where the
topography is similar to that of the coastal plains and
there is a low forest cover [32]. Using human-bait technique in the region extending from the forest to the area
occupied by humans, the authors observed synanthropy
of An. cruzii and An. bellator. This observation led to the
interpretation that the females can fly to the anthropic
environment to feed on blood. In the same study, negative synanthropy was detected when manual aspirators
were used to capture mosquitoes in different resting
places. The exophagic behaviour suggests that the females
return to the natural environment after a blood meal. This
behaviour was confirmed in a study carried out in Serra do
Mar State Park by Guimarães et al [33]. Three different
environments were explored, forest, agriculture and
domestic. Consequently, An. cruzii was observed to blood
feed in the domestic and peridomestic areas.
The physiological age (Parity) of the mosquitoes is also
related to their biting activities. Studies of natural populations of Kerteszia, based in the Polovodova method [34] to
determine the physiological age, indicated that An. cruzii
and An. bellator are predominantly nulliparous, with low
percentages of uniparous and even lower of biparous
[30,35,36]. This low longevity would not explain the vector role of these species, mainly for the rarity of biparous
females (0.1% or 0.0%), as reported in these publications.
However, the same authors reported the presence of nulliparous females, captured using human baits, which ovaries were developed in stages of III the V of Christophers
and Mer. These researchers interpreted this fact as an evidence of gonothrophic discordance in this taxon and that,
therefore, the females can feed in more than one host to
complete their gonothrophic cycle, increasing their vector
potential. Regarding to this condition, it is admitted that,
even so low longevity, the raised density of these mosquitoes constitutes preponderant factor for their vectorial
performance.

Plasmodium transmission
As previously mentioned, An. cruzii and An. bellator have
long been known as important vectors of human and simian malaria parasites [14,25] in southeastern Brazil,
mainly due to their biting behaviour discussed before.
However, most cases occurred in patients coming from
the Amazon region. Only a small number of autochthonous cases are notified every year in the Atlantic forest,
and they are usually oligosymptomatic or even asymptomatic, with a very low parasitaemia [37].

Between 1990 and 2000, about 137 cases of autochthonous Plasmodium vivax malaria occurred in this region.
These cases represented 90% of all the malaria cases in the
state of São Paulo and are closely related to human activities. Morphologically, the parasites associated with autochthonous cases in the Atlantic forest have been
diagnosed as Plasmodium vivax, but Deane [7] suggested
that another species, such as simian Plasmodium, could be
associated with "bromeliad-malaria".
Nowadays, An. cruzii mosquitoes are still involved in the
transmission of human and simian Plasmodium in the valleys of the Atlantic rainforest in the states of Rio de
Janeiro, Espírito Santo, São Paulo, Paraná and Santa Catarina [37-41] and were found, using the ELISA technique,
to be infected with P. vivax and one of its variants, P. vivax
VK247 [40].
The suspected relationship between human and nonhuman primate malaria is clearly evident in these regions.
Serological studies revealed a high frequency of antibodies against peptides of circumsporozoite protein corresponding to Plasmodium vivax variants (VK210 and
VK247), P. malariae/P. brasilianum and human P. vivaxlike/P. simiovale in local human populations and in different wild monkey species. In addition, using the PCR technique, one inhabitant was found to be infected with P.
malariae, suggesting that malaria could be considered a
zoonosis among these inhabitants and that monkeys have
been acting as malaria reservoirs in these non-endemic
areas [37,41-43].
Morphological characteristics
The subgenus Kerteszia comprises twelve species, most of
which recorded from Venezuela. Morphological characters have been used to separate Kerteszia species, including
those found in the Atlantic rainforest. Species identification, however, can be problematic. For example, to distinguish between An. cruzii and An. homunculus using only
adult female characteristics, one needs well preserved
specimens, because the identification is based on the colour of the pigments of the integument and presence, colour, size and position of the spots of pale scales on the
maxillary palpomeres.

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/6/1/127

In considering An. homunculus, An. laneanus, An. cruzii and
An. bellator, for an accurate species separation one needs
male and female adults associated with fourth instar larva
and pupa. Also, the specimens need to be well preserved
and the male genitalia carefully dissected and mounted
on microscope slide.
Morphological differences in the male genitalia have been
widely used to distinguish species of Anopheles [6,44,45].
Anopheles cruzii, An. bellator, An. homunculus and An. laneanus can be separated by characteristics of the ventral and
dorsal claspettes and the aedeagus.
Morphological comparisons of male genitalia of specimens identified as An. homunculus collected in areas of the
Atlantic forest show that samples from Brazil can be distinguished from those illustrated by Komp [46] and
Zavortink [6] by the shape of the setae on the dorsal claspette. Consequently, detailed studies using both morphology and molecular markers will be needed to
ascertain the species status of An. homunculus found in the
Atlantic Forest. We believe that the population that occur
in the east side of Atlantic Forest may correspond to a not
described species that has been largely misidentified as
either An. cruzii or An. homunculus. Furthermore, if this is
correct, the vector status of An. cruzii may be overestimated because An. homunculus may also be involved in
malaria transmission in Atlantic Forest. These species are
sympatric and have been collected in the same habitat
(Sallum et al. unpublished data). Certainly, these hypotheses need to be tested with further studies. Additionally,
characters of both fourth-instar larvae and pupae can distinguish An. cruzii, An. laneanus, An. homunculus and An.
bellator (see [6,10,47] for details), however, details of the
colour pattern of the whole fourth instar larva should be
used to species separation because they clearly distinguish
the species from Atlantic Forest (Sallum et al. unpublished
data).
Genetic studies
Because of the epidemiological importance of An. cruzii in
Plasmodium transmission, studies of the morphological
characteristics, genetic population and molecular polymorphism of Plasmodium vectors have focused on this
species. These studies suggest that An. cruzii may constitute a species complex [6,48-51]. However, despite their
epidemiological importance, little is known about the
genetics of these anophelines.

Morphological differences were observed among populations from the states of Santa Catarina and Rio de Janeiro
[6], suggesting that An. cruzii could represent more than
one differentiated population. Ramirez and Densen
[48,49] when they analysed polytene chromosome patterns, provided evidence for genetically distinct An. cruzii

Malaria Journal 2007, 6:127

populations. They showed that three X chromosome
forms (A, B and C) exist, suggesting a process of incipient
speciation of this species. As heterozygous individuals
were never found in these populations, the authors discarded a hypothesis of chromosome polymorphism.
The possibility that An. cruzii may be a complex was supported by isoenzymatic analysis of several An. cruzii populations. An. cruzii populations in southern and
southeastern Brazil (in the states of Santa Catarina, São
Paulo and Rio de Janeiro) appear to be closely related to
each other but genetically distinct from a population in
the south of the state of Bahia [50]. It appears that there is
a continuous area in southern Brazil in which one species
is distributed, and that this is separated from a different
population found in the south of the state of Bahia.
Recently, Malafronte et al [51] compared sequences of the
second internal transcribed spacer of ribosomal DNA
(ITS2) of several An. cruzii populations with the chromosomal forms proposed by Ramirez and Densen [48,49].
Their findings showed high levels of ITS2 sequence polymorphism among An. cruzii captured in the states of São
Paulo and Santa Catarina. However, in contrast to the
results obtained by Malafronte et al [51], restriction digest
analysis of ITS2 fragments showed no polymorphism in
banding patterns among an F1 generation of An. cruzii
mosquitoes captured in the states of Santa Catarina,
Paraná and São Paulo [52]. Although the results were not
conclusive, all the studies strongly suggest that An. cruzii is
a complex of at least two sibling species. Calado and Navarro-Silva [53] identified specific digestion patterns in An.
cruzii and An. homunculus using ITS2 RFLP, indicating that
this could be used as a tool to distinguish between these
species. It should be noted that none of the ITS2
sequences generated by Calado et al [52] and Calado and
Navarro-Silva [53] have been deposited in GeneBank, preventing further analyses of the sequences used in both
studies.
Among the remaining Kerteszia species, this approach was
only used with An. bellator species, and the results indicated a low level of gene flow between Brazilian populations.
When Brazilian and Trinidad populations were compared, gene flow between populations was even lower
[54]. The authors could not explain the apparent interruption in the geographical distribution of this species in
North and South America and suggested that a recent geographical split of An. bellator populations may not have
allowed enough time for speciation.

Conclusion
The Kerteszia species Atlantic forest domain are relatively
well known in Brazil. However, the distribution limits of
each species need to be studied in detail because of the
scarcity of distribution studies and the continuous and
intense environmental changes that can restrict the geographic distribution of a mosquito taxon.
No larval studies in natural habitats have been carried out
in recent years, and these should be encouraged. Studies
of the general activity of Kerteszia anophelines, particularly that of adult females, could explain the epidemiological role of the main vector species involved in the
propagation of human and simian malaria parasites.
However, the parasitological aspect of transmission is still
rarely explored in scientific works, and many questions
remain to be answered. These include maintenance of
autochthonous malaria, the zoonotic nature of the parasitism, the role played by monkeys and the introduction
of parasites from other areas.
Traditional taxonomy can clearly distinguish this subgenus and its respective species, and reliable means for identifying external morphology are available. However,
molecular taxonomy has given rise to new challenges by
showing the existence of population variations at the
genomic level. These variations suggest the existence of
sibling species complexes in the distribution area of An.
cruzii. Detailed morphological studies are required to
evaluate whether there are morphological variations corresponding to the molecular variations observed in populations of An. cruzii. Studies of the vector competence and
capacity of these possible cryptic species are also needed.
To this end, training in both species identification and
field work is crucial to develop a reliable molecular taxonomy. Analysis of F1 progenies from wild mosquitoes is
needed not only for the Kerteszia subgenus but in all studies involving molecular and phylogenetic analysis, as
some phenotype characteristics are only seen in one gender (male or female) depending on the mosquitoes that
are being identified. Additionally, analysis of F1 progeny
will allow a better evaluation of both individual morphological and molecular variation and will enable voucher
sequences generated from a species to be kept.
The tendency is for the territory of the Kerteszia subgenus
in Brazil, and thus the populations of these anophelines,
to be preserved because of the growing environmental
protection as a result of worldwide ecological awareness.
This can be explained by the strong dependence of this
taxon on the forest, and thus the terms "forest-malaria"
and "bromeliad-malaria" are both appropriate.

With a low incidence of malaria, the current epidemiological picture is expected to be maintained in the future by
either zoonotic transmission or the introduction of Plasmodium from endemic regions to risk areas. However,
occasional malaria outbreaks have happened in the area
in the last years, with significantly higher number of
malaria cases compared with what was being annually
reported, probably due to environment changes and the
high number of asymptomatic individuals in the area acting as reservoirs. In this way, all the territory in the Atlantic forest that survived deforestation will need to be
carefully monitored, not only by researchers but also by
health and control services. As environmental legislation
covering these areas comes into effect, there will be a tendency for malaria transmission to persist in this region.
