Abstract
The Anabaena sensory rhodopsin transducer (ASRT) is a small protein that has been claimed to
function as a signaling molecule downstream of the cyanobacterial sensory rhodopsin. However,
orthologs of ASRT have been detected in several bacteria that lack rhodopsin, raising questions
about the generality of this function. Using sequence profile searches we show that ASRT defines
a novel superfamily of β-sandwich fold domains. Through contextual inference based on domain
architectures and predicted operons and structural analysis we present strong evidence that these
domains bind small molecules, most probably sugars. We propose that the intracellular versions
like ASRT probably participate as sensors that regulate a diverse range of sugar metabolism
operons or even the light sensory behavior in Anabaena by binding sugars or related metabolites.
We also show that one of the extracellular versions define a predicted sugar-binding structure in
a novel cell-surface lipoprotein found across actinobacteria, including several pathogens such as
Tropheryma, Actinomyces and Thermobifida. The analysis of this superfamily also provides new data
to investigate the evolution of carbohydrate binding modes in β-sandwich domains with very
different topologies.

Introduction
In the past decade membrane-embedded photoactive retinylidene-containing rhodopsins have been identified in
several bacteria [1]. One such rhodopsin from the cyanobacterium Anabaena, which utilizes a chlorophyll-based
photosynthetic apparatus, was proposed to function as a
sensory rhodopsin, as opposed to being a proton pump
[2-4]. Inference of a sensory function for the Anabaena
sensory rhodopsin (ASR) was based on several features
[2], including its co-transcription with a 14 kDa protein
with which it was shown to physically interact. This cotranscribed 14 kDa protein has been proposed to function

as an analog of the G-protein signal transducers associated
with the animal visual rhodopsins [2,5] and was accordingly named ASRT ("Anabaena sensory rhodopsin transducer"). The solution of the three-dimensional structure
of ASRT showed that it formed a tetrameric structure
which was believed to mimic the G-β subunit of the animal visual rhodopsin [5]. However, it was observed that
orthologs of ASRT were found in other bacteria, such as
Thermotoga maritma [5], whose genomes do not encode
any rhodopsin homolog. This observation raised questions regarding the more general function of the ASRT
proteins and also its actual role in connection to ASR in

Anabaena. This prompted us to systematically investigate
ASRT homologs with the view of gleaning new functional
information regarding this family by means of comparative genomics analysis. As a consequence we show that
ASRT defines a novel family of prokaryotic small-molecule-binding domains that function in a wide range of
contexts, predominantly as a carbohydrate sensor.

Results and discussion
Detection of novel ASRT homologs
The 3D structure of ASRT (PDB: 2II7) shows that the
entire protein is comprised of a single globular domain
with an eight-stranded β-sandwich fold [5]. All previously
reported homologs of ASRT are similarly sized singledomain proteins (completely congruent to the PFAM
alignment DUF1362 [6]) from various prokaryotes. To
identify potential previously undetected homologs we initiated a series of sequence profile searches with known
representatives of ASRT from different bacteria. A PSIBLAST search with the Thermotoga maritma ASRT ortholog
(PDB: 1NC7) against NR database detected segments of
putative secreted amidases from certain chloroflexi with evalues of borderline significance (e = 0.013) and then converged. These alignments corresponded to regions that
did not overlap with the amidase catalytic domain and
did not correspond to any previously described domains.
These segments in the amidases were also independently
detected in a search with the ASRT alignment as a HMM
against the NR database using the recently released
HMMER3 program (e = .024). Despite their borderline evalues, the alignment with the ASRT starting point
extended throughout the entire globular domain in the
latter and showed conservation of structurally critical
hydrophobic residues. To test this relationship we performed a search with the above-detected sequence segments from the amidases against a library of HMMs
derived from PDB structures as seeds using HHpred,
which performs profile-profile comparisons, and recovered the Anabaena ASRT and its Thermotoga orthologs as
the best hits with significant e-values (E = 10-3). Likewise,
a reciprocal PSI-BLAST search initiated with one of these
regions detected in the amidases (residues 373471 of
gi:148657162; Roseiflexus sp. RS-1) identified Anabaena
ASRT and its Thermotoga orthologs (e-values = 7*10-3, iteration 2) and in subsequent iterations retrieved all known
ASRT homologs. This search also detected multiple
repeats of the segment related to ASRT in the Roseiflexus
amidase-domain-containing protein. In further transitive
searches using representatives of these additional segments as query (e.g. 148270795, 679789), we retrieved,
in addition to the previously identified homologs,
sequences from actinobacteria such as Tropheryma whipplei. Reciprocal PSI-BLAST searches with representatives of
the segments detected in these actinobacterial sequences
(e.g. gi:28493092) retrieved several other actinobacterial

sequences together with representatives of sequences
found in the initial searches (see Additional file 1 for
details). None of these newly found sequences was recovered by the PFAM model DUF1362 or has been previously
reported as being related to ASRT. The secondary-structure
prediction for the newly detected sequences with significant relationship to ASRT suggested an all-β fold congruent with that determined for ASRT and it T. maritima
ortholog. Taken together, these investigations indicated
that ASRT and its cognates from other prokaryotes
belonged to a larger superfamily of homologous domains,
which might occur in more than one copy and in combination with other domains in a polypeptide (see below).
Hereinafter, we refer to this domain as the ASRAH (for
Anabaena sensory ahodopsin- associated omology)
domain.
Classification and structural analysis of ASRAH domains
Based on clustering with BLAST scores and domain architectural features the ASRAH domains can be divided into
3 families with distinctive phyletic patterns (see Additional file 1, Table S1 and Fig. 1 for details). The first of
these, defined by the stand-alone, intracellular versions of
the domain similar to ASRT, are found in addition to Thermotoga and Anabaena in some actinobacteria, proteobacteria, firmicutes, Chthoniobacter flavus (verrucomicrobia),
the extremely thermophilic Dictyoglomus [7] as well as the
archaeon Natrialba magadii. The second family is present
in secreted proteins, always fused to an amidase domain,
and is predominantly found in photosynthetic bacteria
such as Roseiflexus, Chloroflexus and Herpetosiphon. The
third family, also secreted, is found mainly in actinobacteria and is defined by unique N- and C-terminal conserved extensions flanking the ASRAH domains. A
multiple sequence alignment of the ASRAH domain was
generated by editing a preliminary alignment produced by
the KALIGN program based on PSI-BLAST HSPs and secondary structure predictions (Fig. 2). Examination of the
structures reveals that key structural elements of the Anabaena representative have been mutated to obtain its crystal structure. As consequence there are major distortions
in this structure and it is unlikely to represent the native
condition of the ASRAH domain. Hence, we continued
further analysis using the Thermotoga ASRT structure determined as part of the Structural Genomics initiative
(1NC7). Superposition of the secondary structure of this
protein onto the alignment of the ASRAH superfamily
shows that the sequence conservation is comprised predominantly of hydrophobic residues defining the core
that stabilizes the β-sandwich. However, there are a few
residues that distinguish this fold from other previously
characterized β-sandwich folds. These include: 1) a wellconserved tryptophan, usually following a polar residue,
present at the start of the first strand. This tryptophan
appears to be central to a hydrophobic interaction

required to hold the two β-sheets of the sandwich together
(Fig. 2). 2) A nearly absolutely conserved asparagine
located at the end of the second β-strand. The asparagine
forms two hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyls
of the residues 2 and 4 positions downstream from it. Further, there are no gaps in this part of the alignment suggesting that this conserved asparagine helps in stabilizing
the characteristic tight turn between strand 2 and 3 of the
structure.
An examination of the structure of the ASRAH domain
suggests that the β-sandwich is composed of two internal
repeats of four strands each the first, third and fourth
strand of each repeat are in one sheet of the β-sandwich
while the second is in the opposite sheet. This topology
distinguishes the ASRAH domain from other structurally

comparable β-sandwich domains such as those found in
the β-galactosidase [8] (shows evidence for independent
duplication and lacks the C-terminal strand relative to the
ASRAH β-sandwich) and the carbohydrate binding module CMB4 from the thermostable xylanase from Rhodothermus marinus [9] (which has additional N-terminal
strands and displays a circular permutation of the last
strand relative to the ASRAH β-sandwich; see Fig. 2). The
structure shows that the solo ASRAH domain from Thermotoga exists as a tetramer with each unit containing a
deep cleft that could potentially form a binding-pocket on
one face of the sheet. In two of the monomers in the structure we observed that the pocket contains a 1,2-ethanediol molecule (Fig. 2), but contains considerable room for
a much larger molecule such as a pentose or a larger sugar.
Interestingly, the binding cleft is lined by two residues

Figure 2 (see previous page)
Conserved structural and sequence features of the ASRAH domain
Conserved structural and sequence features of the ASRAH domain. A) Topology diagrams of Thermotoga TM1070
and the Rhodothermus marinus carbohydrate-binding module (CBM4-2) present in xylanase 10A. Equivalent strands are colored
similarly. Numbers below each topology diagram illustrate the strand order. Note the circular permutation in the CBM4-2
domain. Additional N-terminal strands characteristic of CBM4-2 are colored orange. B) Cartoon representation of Thermotoga
ASRAH homolog TM1070 (PDB: 1NC7), with key residue side-chains represented as sticks. Predicted ligand-binding residues
are marked in green (H25 and C29), and other conserved residues (W7 and N32) in yellow. C) Surface model of the TM1070
tetramer, with the conserved histidine (H25) and cysteine (C29) of chain A marked in blue and yellow respectively. The 1,2ethanediol molecule detected in the ligand-binding pocket of Thermotoga TM1070 is rendered as spheres. D) Comprehensive
multiple sequence alignment of the ASRAH domain. Proteins are represented by their gene names, species abbreviations and
gis. The coloring reflects the consensus at 70% conservation and highly conserved residues are shaded in red. Consensus
abbreviations are listed in the lower panel. Refer to the Additional file 1 for species abbreviations.

from the second strand containing the SHEshChhN signature (where "h" is a hydrophobic and "s" a small residue),
which is nearly absolutely conserved in the ASRT-like family. The H and the C from this signature are seen to contact
the 1,2-ethanediol in the structure, suggesting that they
might be key to binding a ligand in this family. While this
strand is well-conserved in the other families, these families possess their own distinctive residues instead of the H
and C. This suggests that though they are likely to contain
a similar cleft as the ASRT-like family, they might bind distinct ligands. Further, the walls of this cleft are formed in
part by the dimer interface (Fig. 2). In line with this, we
found that the ASRAH domains in the other families
always occur either as dyads (the actinomycete family, Fig.
1) or as tetrads (the amidase associated versions, Fig. 1),
suggesting that they might all have the potential to form
homo- or hetero- tetrameric structures.
A ligand-binding pocket on one face of the sheet is particularly common in other β-sandwich domains, especially
those involved in carbohydrate binding e.g. the CMB4 of
xylanases and the DOMON domain. However the ASRAH
domain differs from the former in having its predicted-ligand pocket on the opposite face relative to the CMB4
domains and in being topologically very distinct from the
ten-stranded DOMON domains [10].
Domain architectures and gene neighborhoods point to a
carbohydrate-binding role for the ASRAH domain
We sought to obtain further evidence for the ligand-binding role of the ASRAH domains based on their domain
architectures and predicted operonic associations. The
predicted gene neighborhoods of the solo versions of the
ASRAH domain show multiple associations with genes
encoding various carbohydrate metabolism proteins. One
gene neighborhood conserved across many phylogenetically distant bacteria, including Thermotoga, combines a
gene for the solo ASRT-like ASRAH proteins with genes
encoding a sugar isomerase, a sugar aldolase and a sugar
kinase. Another widely distributed bacterial conserved
gene neighborhood combines the solo ASRT-like gene

with a cluster of genes encoding an ABC transporter system specific for monosaccharide (Fig. 1). ASRT-like genes
are also frequently combined in operons with genes
encoding other potential sugar metabolism-related
enzymes such as amylases (e.g. Sinorhizobium), pyruvate
decarboxylase/oxidase, a sugar/sugar acid dehydratase/
racemase and a FAD-dependent oxidoreductase related to
the glycolate oxidase (Fig. 1). Interestingly, in the actinobacterium Rubrobacter xylanophilus two paralogous copies
of ASRT orthologs are each associated with either the isomerase, aldolase and kinase gene neighborhood or the
pyruvate decarboxylase/oxidase, dehydratase/racemase
neighborhood. Thus, these linkages strongly support the
ASRT-like domains regulating distinct sugar metabolism
process in cis. The amidase domain found fused to the
ASRAH domain is of the N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine
amidase, which is consistent with a potential role for the
ASRAH domain in binding elements of peptidoglycan.
The cell-surface versions found mainly in the actinomycetes are predicted to be lipoproteins because their N-terminal region contains a conserved signal peptide
sequence followed by an absolutely conserved cysteine
reminiscent of the "lipobox" [11]. They additionally contain an internal cysteine, just N-terminal to the ASRAH
domain (Fig. 2), which could form the site of a second distinct lipid modification. Their predicted gene-neighborhood context, which is conserved in practically all
actinomycetes encoding such an ASRAH domain protein,
shows a tight linkage to a transcription factor of the WhiB
family, a glycosyltransferase and an inactive version of a
zincin-like metallopeptidase. In some organisms the glycosyltransferase and the ASRAH domain containing protein are fused into a single polypeptide (Frankia sp. CcI3)
supporting the functional linkage between these proteins.
Thus, these cell-surface proteins also display contextual
connections that are compatible with them binding sugars. It is likely that they are lipid-modified themselves and
form an actinobacteria-specific cell-surface structure by
binding a polysaccharide created by the linked glycosyltransferase or recruiting the same enzyme to a precursor
polysaccharide.

Thus, the contextual evidence, combined with the structural evidence for ligand-binding, favors the ASRAH
domain being a sugar-binding domain, in the manner of
many other β-sandwich structures. This is not unexpected
for the secreted or cell-surface versions of the ASRAH
domain because it is consistent with the function of many
other extracellular β-sandwich structures in binding cellsurface polysaccharides, which are parts of the peptidoglycan, glycoprotein and other polymeric carbohydrate layers that decorate prokaryotic cell surfaces. However, the
intracellular standalone ASRAH domains are somewhat
functionally unexpected because they appear to represent
a novel regulatory mechanism a potential sugar-sensor
that might influence the function of other enzymes or
sugar transporters encoded by the conserved gene-neighborhood via physical interactions with them depending
on sugar concentrations. In light of this, we propose that
the unusual linkage to the rhodopsin, which is observed
only in the cyanobacterium Nostoc, might represent a
novel mechanism in which the behavior of a light sensor
(ASR) is influenced via interaction with an intracellular
sensor of a sugar or a related metabolite (ASRT). It is plausible that this interaction might have a role in phototaxis
in response to intracellular nutrient status.
General discussion
Our investigation demonstrates that ASRT belongs to a
superfamily of domains predicted to bind small molecules, most likely sugars, in both extracellular and intracellular locations in various bacterial and few archaeal
proteins. On one hand the presence of sugar binding
capability in a β-sandwich scaffold is hardly unprecedented for domains found in extracellular or cell-surface
proteins. Nevertheless, the identification of such a potential sugar-binding element in a novel cell-surface lipoprotein is of interest especially given its presence across
actinobacteria, including several pathogens such as Tropheryma, Actinomyces and Thermobifida. On the other hand,
the identification of such a function in an intracellular
context is of interest especially because the tetramer-forming standalone versions are predicted to regulate a diverse
range of sugar metabolism operons or even the light sensory behavior in a cyanobacterium. This observation
points to a previously unreported mechanism of regulation by a potential standalone small-molecular sensor
that probably occurs at the level of protein-protein interactions rather than via the sensor domain of a one-component system transcription factor. In this respect such a
regulatory process is closer to the allosteric regulation by
small molecules.

While "sideways" ligand binding via one of the exposed
sheets has been observed in several β-sandwich scaffolds
(e.g. DOMON domain and other carbohydrate-binding
domains [12]), the exact mode of binding is not estab-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/25

lished for all such folds. The analysis of the ASRAH
domain presented here identifies the binding site for one
more of these β-sandwich scaffolds. The proposed binding site for this superfamily of domains reinforces an
observation that presents an interesting evolutionary
conundrum: though several β-sandwich scaffolds bind
ligands in a "sideways" fashion, their topologies greatly
differ from each other. This leads to the question as to
whether there was repeated convergent evolution of the
"sideways" binding mode in various β-sandwiches or
whether it represents an ancestral binding mode for the βsandwich scaffolds, which was preserved despite the
extensive topological rearrangements occurring as consequence of duplication of internal units or accretion of
additional strands. Hence we hope that these observations
would also contribute to the more general understanding
of evolution of ligand binding in β-sandwiches.

Materials and methods
Gene neighborhoods were determined using a custom
script that uses completely sequenced genomes or whole
genome shotgun sequences to derive a table of gene
neighbors centered on a query gene. Then the BLASTCLUST program is used to cluster products in the neighborhood and establish conserved co-occurring genes.
These conserved gene neighborhoods are then sorted as
per a ranking scheme based on occurrence in at least one
other phylogenetically distinct lineage ("phylum" in
NCBI Taxonomy database), complete conservation in a
particular lineage ("phylum") and physical closeness on
the chromosome indicating sharing of regulatory -10 and
-35 elements. Profile searches were conducted using the
PSI-BLAST program [13] with a default profile inclusion
expectation (E) value threshold of 0.01. Profile-profile
comparisons were performed using the HHpred program
[14]. HMM searches were conducted using the newly
released HMMER3 program [15]. Multiple alignments
were constructed using Kalign [16] followed by manual
adjustments based on PSI-BLAST results. Protein secondary structure was predicted using a multiple alignment as
the input for the JPRED program [17].

In this manuscript, De Souza, Iyer and Aravind report the
characterization of a family of proteins which are related
to the Anabena sensory rhodopsin transducer. Through a
rigorous computational analysis the authors first identified homologs of the ASRT gene in several bacteria that
lack a sensory rhodopsin. Through a combination of
genomic context and structural analysis, the authors
report that this domain is likely to bind to small molecules, which are most likely to be sugars. In addition, the
authors identify a subset of such proteins that are predicted to be secreted or membrane associated via lipid
modification in several actinobacteria species, which also
includes certain pathogens. Additional file 1 is comprehensive and provides a good substrate for experiments. In
short, this is an excellent study and I would support publication of this work in Biology Direct upon minor revision:
1. It is currently unclear how the authors identified
secreted proteins and the membrane associated proteins.
Could the authors clarify this point, please? In addition, it
would be good to see a comment on the functional significance of secreting sugar binding proteins rather than having them membrane associated.
Authors' response
Secreted proteins where identified based on detection of
an amino-terminal signal peptide by the program SignalP,
followed by manual inspection. Transmembrane regions
were detected using TMHMM. Except for the Frankia sp.
homolog, which is fused to glycosyltransferase, all proteins with signal peptides (dyads and tetrads) did not have
transmembrane regions and, therefore, are probably
secreted. The functional significance of secreting sugarbinding proteins: these sugar binding domains in the
extracellular proteins are likely to provide a means for
associating with the sugar moieties in extracellular biopolymers such as peptidoglycans and other glycans present in
surface capsules and gums.
