Abstract
Background: There have been many algorithms and software programs implemented for the
inference of multiple sequence alignments of protein and DNA sequences. The "true" alignment is
usually unknown due to the incomplete knowledge of the evolutionary history of the sequences,
making it difficult to gauge the relative accuracy of the programs.
Results: We tested nine of the most often used protein alignment programs and compared their
results using sequences generated with the simulation software Simprot which creates known
alignments under realistic and controlled evolutionary scenarios. We have simulated more than
30000 alignment sets using various evolutionary histories in order to define strengths and
weaknesses of each program tested. We found that alignment accuracy is extremely dependent on
the number of insertions and deletions in the sequences, and that indel size has a weaker effect.
We also considered benchmark alignments from the latest version of BAliBASE and the results
relative to BAliBASE- and Simprot-generated data sets were consistent in most cases.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that employing Simprot's simulated sequences allows the
creation of a more flexible and broader range of alignment classes than the usual methods for
alignment accuracy assessment. Simprot also allows for a quick and efficient analysis of a wider
range of possible evolutionary histories that might not be present in currently available alignment
sets. Among the nine programs tested, the iterative approach available in Mafft (L-INS-i) and
ProbCons were consistently the most accurate, with Mafft being the faster of the two.

Background
The determination of homologous regions of molecular
sequences is often used for the further inference of their
function and evolution, and therefore accurate multiple
sequence alignment (MSA) of nucleic acid and protein
sequences is crucial. Consequently, there has been tremendous effort in the development and implementation
of different MSA algorithms, using distinct approaches to
improve the resulting alignment accuracy.

The accuracy assessment of MSA programs is often done
by employing manually (or semi automatically) curated
sequence databases such as BAliBASE [1], PREFAB [2] and
SABmark [3]. So far, BAliBASE has been the most often
used alignment database in evaluating the performance of
different MSA programs. It was constructed using protein
sequences or models with known three-dimensional
structures. The last inception, version 3.0, had an increase
in the number of available sequences and alignments.

Such improvements apparently have addressed the major
concerns of Karplus and Hu [4] regarding the use of BAliBASE to benchmark MSA algorithms.
Alignment databases provide a source of accurate alignments to gauge the accuracy and speed of different programs, but they also present several disadvantages. Even
though the databases' alignments are manually curated,
there is still the possibility of misalignments which would
result in accuracy assessment problems. The sets of alignments still remain rather small and may not represent the
complete range of scenarios of protein evolution. Furthermore, a major drawback of the use of alignment databases
is that algorithms can potentially be developed and tuned
to the alignments present solely in these data sets.
Recently there have been several DNA sequence simulation packages that incorporate indels, such as MySSP [5]
and DAWG [6]. MySSP has been widely used in different
studies of phylogenetic inference and evolutionary distance estimation coupled with DNA alignment accuracy
[7,8]. For proteins, Lassmann and Sonnhammer [9] in a
previous comparison of MSA algorithms used artificially
created sequence sets generated by the simulation program Rose [10]. Rose simulates sequences of proteins
allowing for the occurrence of indels. Data sets generated
by Rose present their own limitations for the study of the
alignment accuracy. In Rose, indel size and number do
not adequately represent empirical data for proteins that
have diverged for different evolutionary times. Also the
program assumes equal evolutionary rates of all the sites
in the protein.
In this study we introduce an improved approach to assess
alignment accuracy by using simulated protein sequences
generated by Simprot [11]. Simprot is an advanced simulation program that employs a parameterized version of
the Qian and Goldstein [12] insertion and deletion
(indel) distribution. Although the original distribution
was empirically derived from a subset of alignments of
highly diverged protein sequences, the parameterized version permits a very flexible simulation of indels in
sequences for all levels of sequence divergence. Simprot
also allows variable substitution and indel rates at different sites by implementing gamma distributed sites rates
[13]. Three models of amino acids substitution (PMB,
PAM and JTT) are also available. We have used Simprot to
generate known alignments with a wide variety of evolutionary parameters, as well as the latest BAliBASE database
of curated alignments, to investigate the accuracy and
speed of popular and publicly available protein multiple
sequence alignment software programs.

Alignment programs
There are many available computer packages that generate
MSAs of protein sequences. We selected nine of the currently most often used programs (in order of publication
date): Clustal W, Dialign2.2, T-Coffee, POA, Muscle,
Mafft, ProbCons, Dialign-T and Kalign.
Clustal W [14] version 1.8
This is probably the most widely used alignment program
and oldest among the packages tested. The software performs a progressive alignment, first employing a pairwise
sequence comparison by calculating a distance matrix that
stores sequence divergence. After this matrix is obtained, a
tree guide is built using Neighbor Joining, followed by the
third and final step where sequences are aligned according
to the branch order in the guide tree. The program
employs two gap penalties in its alignment procedure: gap
opening and gap extension, and in the case of polypeptides, a full amino acid scoring weight matrix. These gap
penalties are mainly dependent on factors such as the
weight matrix, sequence length and similarity. In simple
cases, Clustal W might accurately align corresponding
domains and sequences of known secondary or tertiary
structure while in more complex cases it can be used as a
good starting point for further refinement.
Dialign2.2 [15] version 2.2.1
This program uses a diagonal method to align sequences
locally and globally. Dialign2.2 does not compare single
residues, but whole uninterrupted (no gaps, mismatches
allowed) stretches of residues that would form diagonals
in a dot-matrix comparison of two sequences. Consequently, it does not penalize the insertion and extension
of gaps, and may leave unrelated segments unaligned. The
first step in the procedure creates all possible pairwise
alignments, storing a collection of diagonals meeting certain consistency criteria [16] without conflicting double
or crossover assignments of residues [15]. All saved diagonals are weighted in order to define entries with maximum
sum of weights, and then sorted in order to determine the
degree of overlap, emphasizing the existence of diagonals
present in multiple sequences. A greedy-like algorithm
does a final processing, checking diagonals scores from top
to bottom creating a final multiple alignment. Gaps are
inserted at the end of the MSA creation until all present
residues are connected.
T-Coffee (Tree-based consistency objective function for alignment
evaluation) [17] version 3.27
T-Coffee employs a progressive strategy in aligning
sequences. The program first creates a library from two
different sources: global alignments from Clustal W and
local alignments from Lalign [18]. For each pair of
sequences global alignments and the pairwise local alignments are created from the ten top-scoring non-intersect-

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:471

ing segments. The program processes the global and local
information, assigning weights to all pairwise alignments
relative to sequence identity [19]. This is followed by the
combination of groups that are merged into a single
library. There is an extension phase for this combined
library, making the final weight of any pair of residues
reflect part of the information contained in the whole
library. A final step requires a calculation of a distance
matrix and a Neighbor Joining tree, since the alignment is
generated with a progressive strategy by aligning the two
closest sequences on the tree according to the weight
stored in the extended library. The initial pair is then fixed
and any existing gaps cannot be shifted later. The progressive alignment continues until every sequence is aligned.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/471

profile alignment. Every tree edge is visited iteratively and
the alignment with an updated summed pairwise score of
each sequence pair is retained. The edges are visited in
order of decreasing distance from the root, with a realignment of individual sequences, moving to more closely
related groups of sequences [23].

POA (Partial Order Alignment) [20] version 2.0
POA is another MSA package that uses a progressive alignment algorithm without using generalized profiles. This
program introduces the use of a Partial Order-Multiple
Sequence Alignment (PO-MSA) format to represent
sequences, and more accurately reflects biological content. This format stores the alignment as a compacted
graph for minimal node and edge counts, still containing
all the information available in a traditional MSA.
Sequences are stored as a linear series of nodes each connected by two edges. POA uses a traditional dynamic programming algorithm [21,22], where linear sequences are
replaced by Partial Order (PO) graphs. These PO structures are transformed in usual 2D matrices and each combination of cells are scored backwards as in a traditional
Smith-Waterman sequence alignment procedure [22].
These matrices are then extended in any direction (diagonal, horizontal, vertical) allowing the production of the
pairwise alignment on junction points. The MSA is
obtained from the alignment of two sequences at the
beginning with the addition of other sequences successively to the initial pair.

Mafft (Multiple sequence alignment based on Fast Fourier
Transform) [25] version 5.732
Mafft is a program that can be used with different alignment approaches, either progressive alignment alone
(with Fast Fourier Transform), or progressive followed by
iterative refinement. Mafft's basic run can have up to three
steps, but the default procedure performs the initial two
steps. First, a progressive alignment is created based on a
rough distance between every sequence pair based on
shared 6-tuples. A guide tree is also generated by UPGMA
with modified linkage and sequences are then aligned following the branch order of the tree (this step alone is
called strategy FFT-NS-1). The second step recalculates a
distance matrix, based on the information gathered on the
previous step, and the progressive alignment is re-done
using a tree obtained from the new matrix as a starting
point (up to this step, the strategy is known as FFT-NS-2
and it is the default used by the software). The last phase
is the iterative refinement which optimizes the Gotoh's
weighted sum of pairs (WSP) [26] score, with a group-togroup alignment [27] and the tree-dependent restriction
partition technique [24]. If all three steps are employed,
the procedure is called FFT-NS-i, meaning it uses an FFT
method to rapidly identify homologous regions present in
the sequences which is followed by an iterative phase of
refinement. FFT converts every single amino acid present
in a sequence to a vector representing volume and polarity, which are important factors on substitution events,
allowing the software to predict such occurrences with
precision.

Muscle (Multiple sequence comparison by log-expectation) [2,23]
version 3.6
Muscle uses a pairwise profile alignment approach. The
program first builds a progressive alignment which is then
improved and refined in two subsequent stages. The progressive alignment is created after the sequence similarities, a distance estimation and a UPGMA tree are
calculated. Muscle uses two distance measures: a kmer distance for unaligned sequence pairs and a Kimura distance
for aligned pairs [2]. The progressive alignment improvement stage creates a new tree with the already calculated
Kimura distance matrix and then builds a better alignment based on this ameliorated tree. The last refinement
stage employs a variant of the tree dependent restricted
partitioning [24]. This method deletes one of the tree
edges, bi-partitioning the alignment and extracting both
partitions' profiles which are then realigned with a profile-

Mafft also includes three additional refinement algorithms: L-INS-i, G-INS-i and E-INS-i [25]. These strategies
increase the number of steps required to create an MSA
alignment to five. In these cases the first step also requires
the construction of a distance matrix, not using 6-tuples.
Differently from the FFT-NS-* approaches there is no
reconstruction of the calculated UPGMA tree and the program moves to the second step, dividing the gap-free segments and storing score arrays for each gap-free segment
from one sequence to another. Mafft then calculates an
"importance" value from the score of the segment and
stores how frequently residues appear on other segments.
All "importance" values are then gathered in an "importance" matrix in step three which is quickly followed by a
group-to-group alignment obtained from the score matrices and a weighting scheme [14] based on a NeedlemanWunsch algorithm. A final step iteratively refines the

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:471

obtained alignments, optimizing a WSP score and the
"importance" values calculated previously.
ProbCons (Probabilistic Consistency-based multiple sequence
alignment) [28] version 1.1
ProbCons is the only program that uses a probabilistic
consistency method of alignment. It is a modification of
the traditional sum-of-pairs scoring system, and in addition incorporates a pair-hidden Markov model-based progressive alignment algorithm. The alignment procedure is
divided into four steps, starting with a computation of
posterior-probability matrices for every pair of sequences.
This is followed by a dynamic programming calculation
of the expected accuracy of every pairwise alignment.
Probabilistic consistency transformation is then
employed in order to re-estimate the match accuracy
scores. A guide tree is calculated with hierarchical clustering with the similarity defined by a weighted average of
values between sequences of each cluster. The guide tree is
used to align the sequences using a progressive approach.
A post-processing phase is also done, where random bipartitions of the generated alignment are realigned in
order to check for better alignment regions. ProbCons differs from other alignment programs since it does not
incorporate biological concepts such as position-specific
gap scoring, evolutionary tree construction and other features commonly used by other packages.
Dialign-T [29] version 0.2.1
This program is a re-implementation of the procedure
developed in Dialign2.2, but with a better solution to deal
with inconsistent fragments, including fragment-chaining. It also implements a new approach for estimating
probabilities of the random occurrence of each fragment
present in the sequence to be aligned. Dialign-T does not
use pre-calculated tables in order to obtain weight scores:
it calculates probability tables from several substitution
matrices. Additionally, the greedy-like multiple alignment
algorithm from Dialign2.2 was changed in order to avoid
spurious local similarities.
Kalign [30] version 1.04
Kalign is another program that uses a progressive alignment approach to obtain the best MSA possible. The main
difference of this algorithm to other methods is that it
employs the Wu-Manber approximate string matching
algorithm [31] when calculating the distance among
sequences. The Wu-Manber algorithm measures the distance between two strings using a Levenshtein edit distance, which allows an efficient search for mismatches
(shared or not) and patterns present in the sequences.
According to the Kalign developers, this methodology
allows for a distance estimation which is as fast as an ktuple algorithm but is more accurate [30]. The first step in
the alignment procedure is to calculate the pairwise dis-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/471

tances using the Wu-Manber approach. The pairwise distance estimation is followed by a construction of a guide
tree by using UPGMA, which is employed in a global
dynamic programming method to align the sequences/
profiles. Additionally, the program performs a consistency check in order to define the largest set of sequence
matches that can be inserted in the alignment, using a
modified version of the Needleman-Wunsch [21] to find
the most consistent path through the dynamic programming matrix. Also, Kalign updates the positions of pattern
matchings, which adjusts the absolute position of
matches found within sequences to their relative positions within generated profiles [30].

Results
Simprot simulated sequences
Simprot's simulation parameters provide flexibility for
generating alignments so that the effects of distinct factors
can be examined together and/or separately under multiple evolutionary scenarios. Simulated sequences were
used to investigate the influence of sequence length, indel
frequency, indel length, evolutionary distance, terminal
gaps length, gamma density function and tree topology
on the accuracy of alignments inferred by different programs. More than 30000 alignments were created independently by Simprot using five phylogenetic trees
(Figure 2) with variable lengths and different number of
variable size indels, in order to cover different topological
evolutionary patterns. Simprot generates a known alignment and another file containing the sequences with no
indels. One hundred simulated alignments with different
random seed values were created for each combination of
tested parameters. All corresponding sequences were also
aligned with the nine programs described above and the
resulting alignments were compared to the "true" alignment generated by Simprot. The average accuracy values
for the 100 alignments of each set are reported here and in
some cases a Wilcoxon signed ranks test was employed in
order to determine the statistical significance of the difference on average accuracy. The protein substitution matrix
used in all simulations was PMB [32], which is also the
program's default.

As reported previously [9], sequence length does not affect
alignment accuracy of the different programs. In order to
confirm this, five different root sequence lengths were
employed in the analysis: 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300
amino acids. These values were selected in order to get the
resulting alignments in a feasible amount of time, while
maintaining a significant difference in root sequence
lengths. To determine the effect of amino acid substitutions and sequence length on alignment accuracy, we first
kept the indel frequency and indel length very low and
considered different trees with various overall evolutionary distances and with increasing root sequence lengths.

Overall average accuracy values obtained with all Simprot's simulated sequences and all BAliBASE's references. Results are ordered by date of publication. Values in the same column that are not significantly different according to a
Wilcoxon signed ranks test (p < 0.05) have the same colour; values in black are significantly different, and bold font represents
the largest value in the column. CPU times are normalized to Mafft FFT-NS-2 and were obtained with a 44 sequence alignment
of 500 residues.
The majority of the packages tested generated results ranging from good to excellent with increasing sequence
length. POA presented the lowest accuracies on the performed tests and at the same time was positively affected
by sequence length increase (Figure 3). POA's lower accuracy appears to be due to a tendency of the program to
place large internal gaps close to the sequence terminals,
while the accuracy increase in larger sequence lengths
might be explained by the proportionally small influence
of these terminal gaps in the alignment scoring. Apparently, the alignment of sequences with a large number of
substitutions but a low number of gaps did not present a
problem for any of the nine algorithms used, no matter
the size of the sequence. Noticeably, Clustal W showed
the steepest decline in accuracy when sequence length was
increased even at very low gap frequency values (Figure 3
and 4). The program occasionally had an alignment accuracy decrease two to three times larger than the average for
all other seven programs (Figure 4B), especially when
indels were added to the reference alignments.
Different indel frequencies were also used in the simulations in order to test the effect of indel occurrences in
alignment accuracy. Simprot's process for insertions and
deletions assumes a Poisson model, where the expected
frequency of indels between two sequences separated by
an expected 100 PAM distance is
p = 1 - e-z/c
where z is the indel probability that is scaled by the evolutionary scale factor c. The smallest frequency p employed
was the program's default value 3% and increased up to
30%. As expected, when indels were added to the simulated sequences and evolutionary distance was increased,
there was an evident loss in accuracy for all programs. This
corroborates results obtained by Lassmann and Sonn-

hammer [9], who showed that programs tended to have
poorer performance as the evolutionary distance
increased when indels were present. The best results were
generated by ProbCons and Mafft L-INS-i. ProbCons presented better results for trees with longer evolutionary distances when intermediate to large indel frequencies were
applied. Conversely, Mafft L-INS-i performed better for
smaller evolutionary distances and with intermediate
indel frequency values (Figure 4).
In Simprot the evolutionary distance set by the branch
lengths in the input tree affects the expected number of
substitutions and also affects the expected number of
insertions and deletions. In order to further analyze the
influence of branch lengths on alignment accuracy, we
considered a single tree topology and scaled the branches
(Figure 2, tree A) so that the overall tree shape was not
changed (Figure 5). As shown above, all programs were
negatively affected by increased evolutionary distances,
particularly when the employed indel frequency parameter was high. POA had the steepest decline in accuracy, at
small indel frequencies (Figure 5A).
Due to the fact that indel frequency appeared to have a
large effect on MSA accuracy, we analyzed the effect of
increasing the indel frequency independently of other factors (Figure 6). Our results showed that accuracy and its
rate of decline with indel frequency depended on the
input tree used. Trees with longer branch lengths (Figure
6A) had sharp decreases in accuracy with increasing indel
frequencies. Input trees with shorter branch lengths
showed smaller declines in accuracy (Figure 6B–C). For
most programs, when a topology with varied branch
length was used, the accuracy decrease was almost linear
with increasing indel frequency. ProbCons and Mafft LINS-i were the least affected by the increase in evolutionary distance and resulted in the best performances.

Tree topologies used in the analysis
Tree topologies used in the analysis. A, D and E are artificially created topologies, while B and C are based on PFAM
alignments.

Another element that can influence the occurrence and
number of indels in protein sequences is the tree topology. We considered this independently of evolutionary
distance and Simprot's indel frequency by considering
two trees with identical maximum evolutionary distance
(Figure 2, Trees D and E) but with different topologies.
Although evolution had occurred at different locations in
the two tree topologies tested (tips opposed to internal
nodes), this did not seem to have large influence on overall alignment accuracy for the majority of the algorithms
analyzed (Figure 7), as in both cases programs obtained
similar alignment scores.

Real protein sequence data often contains non-homologous terminal ends and/or incomplete sequences. We
investigated the effect of large terminal gaps on alignment
accuracy. A small modification in Simprot's code was necessary to include an additional probability of terminal
gaps. Since no reasonable biological model exist for external gaps, we introduced an ad hoc parameter t which determines the probability and length of external gaps by
scaling the probabilities for internal gaps. Five different
values of the terminal gaps insertion parameter were used
while keeping the internal gap frequency constant (5%)
for these simulations. It was observed that the presence of
terminal gaps, regardless of their length, had a minimum
effect on alignment accuracy for most of the programs

different values (2, 3 and 4) of Simprot's c parameter were
tested. This value is used by the generalized Qian and
Goldstein distribution [11,12] in indel length determination. Larger c values yield shorter indels while smaller values result in longer ones [11]. The indel frequency was
kept constant. We found that the larger the indels the
lower the alignment accuracy, although with a moderate
difference in the final average score (Figure 9). This accuracy loss could be seen for all phylogenetic trees analyzed
and for the majority of the programs. Again, Mafft L-INSi and ProbCons seemed to fare better and were least
affected by the variation in gap length.

According to Rosenberg [7], changes in the shape of the
gamma distribution, of Yang's [13] distribution of evolutionary rates, influences alignment accuracy. The gamma
shape models the proportion of slow to fast evolving positions and accounts for variable substitution rates among
sites; the lower the α the larger the number of sites with
low substitution rate. Decreasing gamma's α shape
parameter positively affected the alignment accuracy (Figure 10), due to an increasing number of identical sites
between sequences. Simprot allows the modification of
the gamma's α shape parameter and in our study it was set
at 0.1, 0.7, 1 (Simprot's default), 5 and 10. We examined
changing α using different topologies and indel frequency
values. The obtained results show a moderate influence of
the value of gamma α at low indel frequencies, resulting
in an accuracy loss for most of the programs, especially for
POA. When larger indel frequencies were employed, the
negative effect of increasing gamma was accentuated up to
α = 5, which was reversed by a small gain in accuracy
when α was increased from 5 to 10 (Figure 10). This is
expected, since with α values the gamma distribution of

evolutionary rates tends to be less extreme (exponential)
and to have a curve shape similar to the normal distribution.
In order to deduce why there was a large influence of
insertions and deletions on the programs' performance,
we analyzed the average number of gaps per sequence
present in the "true" alignment and in all resulting alignments (Figure 11). As mentioned above, POA had the tendency of inserting long internal gaps at the sequence
terminals; this inflates the average number of gaps in the
alignments that are constructed by the program. Clustal
W, under default parameters, was the most conservative of

the programs tested and in every case had a smaller gap
number average for its alignments than other packages
and the known alignment. Kalign and ProbCons were the
programs with a final number of inserted gaps closest to
the real alignment in the majority of the simulations.
Overall, programs that use a progressive alignment with
tree determination showed a smaller gap number average
per sequence than the programs that do not use a guide
tree (POA, Dialign2.2 and Dialign-T).
In summary our results show that it is the total number of
indels independently of where in the tree they occur, and
to some degree independently of the number substitu-

tions, that had the greatest effect on alignment accuracy.
Also, indel size plays a role in alignment accuracy, but to
a lesser extent than indel number. Additionally, the
gamma distribution of evolutionary rates generally had a
negative effect on the final accuracy. Regarding program
performance, ProbCons and Mafft L-INS-i achieved the
best results in the majority of the simulated alignments
sets. An intermediary group consisted of T-Coffee, Muscle,
Mafft FFT-NS-2 and Kalign, while Clustal W, POA, Dialign-T and Dialign2.2 often produced the poorest alignment accuracy. An overall summary of alignment accuracy
for each program is shown in Figure 1. With the exception
of Clustal W, in scenarios of large sequence lengths and
indel frequency, programs that have a tree-guided multiple alignment procedure showed better results than those
that do not rely on tree determination to align protein
sequences. As pointed above, programs with a tree-determination step were more conservative in inserting gaps
than programs that lack this step, generally achieving better final accuracies.

BAliBASE
It was important to determine if the results obtained from
the Simprot-generated sequences were applicable to alignments from actual proteins. We considered the accuracy of
the nine programs on the latest version of BAliBASE alignments (Figure 1). Overall we found results similar to those
obtained on the simulated sequences in that ProbCons
and Mafft using strategy L-INS-i appeared to have the best
performance. In BAliBASE's reference RV11, containing
equidistant sequences sharing less than 20% identity,
ProbCons and Mafft L-INS-i were not statistically different
according to the Wilcoxon signed ranks test (p > 0.05).
The same result with no statistical separation was
observed in reference RV20, which is composed of
sequences from divergent subfamilies, in reference RV30,
comprised of sequences from protein families with some
highly diverged sequences, and in reference RV50, made
of sequences with large insertions.

ProbCons did perform significantly better than Mafft LINS-i in the set RV12 that contains equidistant sequences
sharing between 20 and 40% identity. Mafft L-INS-i and

Alignment accuracy comparison when increasing terminal gaps were inserted in the alignments. The program
rankings are much different than in other situations analyzed. Mafft L-INS-i and ProbCons were the top performers, followed
closely by T-Coffee, Muscle and Mafft FFT-NS-2. t is the parameter used to determine the length of inserted terminal gaps in
Simprot.

T-Coffee were not statistically different (Wilcoxon signed
ranks test, p > 0.05). Conversely, on reference RV40 composed of protein sequences with large extensions, Mafft LINS-i outperformed all other packages, with ProbCons
and T-Coffee not far behind and not significantly different.
When results for all references are analyzed together, the
same pattern observed from the isolated references was
also found. In this broader scenario, ProbCons and Mafft
L-INS-i achieved the best results and the difference in final
alignment accuracy is not statistically significant (Wilcoxon signed ranks test, p > 0.05). An intermediary pack
is formed of two distinct groups (defined by Wilcoxon
signed ranks test) where Muscle and T-Coffee did slightly
better than Mafft FFT-NS-2, Kalign and Clustal W. Showing the poorest performance for the whole database set
were Dialign-T, Dialign2.2, which were statistically indis-

tinguishable, and POA. Overall, the results from Simprot
and BAliBASE data sets were consistent, with the exception of Mafft FFT-NS-2 which ranked significantly lower
on BAliBASE data sets than on Simprot's. These results
corroborate in part the findings of Lassmann and Sonnhammer [9], that showed T-Coffee as the best available
algorithm at the time for BAliBASE v2 alignments. Their
result also indicated POA as the program with the poorest
performance.
Speed of execution
Mafft FFT-NS-2 was the fastest program for all tested
sequence sizes (Figure 12). T-Coffee, as shown before [9],
had the worst speed, with an average alignment time for
the smallest sequence set (100 amino acids) longer than
for Clustal W, Mafft (FFT-NS-2 and L-INS-i), Kalign and
POA when aligning the largest set. ProbCons had the second worst average time for most sequence sizes.

show the modest effect of longer indels on the alignment loss of accuracy. ProbCons and Mafft L-INS-i are the top performers,
followed by T-Coffee, Mafft FFT-NS-2, Muscle and Kalign respectively. There is a bottom group formed by the remainder of
the programs.

Discussion
Overall, Mafft L-INS-i and ProbCons generated the best
alignments on our test data, including simulated
sequences and BAliBASE's v3.0 reference sets, while POA,
Dialign2.2, Dialign-T and Clustal W had the worse accuracy. The intermediary group, formed by T-Coffee, Muscle, Mafft FFT-NS-2 and Kalign in some cases presented
similar results to the top two algorithms, especially T-Coffee and Mafft FFT-NS-2 in tests with short evolutionary
distances and low gap frequency and length. This showed
the quality of the algorithms and that different
approaches to sequence alignment can converge on a very
similar MSA.
Additionally, we only tested the programs with their
default parameters; different program configurations
might improve their accuracy. Our results are consistent
with those previously reported in the original articles of
Mafft L-INS-i [25] and ProbCons [28], where they ranked
top with the best accuracy on BAliBASE v2 alignments.

In this work, it could be observed that all programs have
strengths and weaknesses, and among the best performers
Mafft has the most flexible algorithm. The recent additions to the program certainly contributed to improve
alignment accuracy. Mafft also has a very fast algorithm
even when aligning iteratively. It has been suggested that
Mafft's accuracy could be increased by incorporating
structural information [25]. ProbCons had very similar
results and sometimes performed even better than Mafft
L-INS-i, but it is the second slowest program overall. The
alignment power of its algorithm is excellent, even though
it does not consider any biological aspect of the sequences
when performing an MSA.
In the intermediary group, T-Coffee and Muscle were the
better alternatives, considering that Mafft FFT-NS-2 did
not perform as well as the iterative approaches, and Kalign
showed inconsistent results in most cases faring below the
other three programs. T-Coffee generates good alignments
and has the merit of combining alignments from different
sources [25], but the processing time is the worst for every

sequence size. Muscle, on the other hand, is an iterative
program that produces good quality alignments, often
comparable to T-Coffee and Mafft FFT-NS-2, with the
advantage of being extremely fast. Muscle allows an
increase in the number of iterative steps in its procedure
(not tested here) that can probably ameliorate its final
alignment quality. Kalign presented accuracy values in
most of the cases lower than the other three programs in
this intermediary group, but showed very good results at
low indel frequency values. The packages with poorest
performance, Clustal W, POA, Dialign-T and Dialign2.2,
also present qualities such as the rapid assembly of accurate MSAs of closely related sequences with a low number
of indels. These programs may be employed to create an
initial alignment that can be further improved with
another algorithm. Clustal W showed good accuracy
results in the alignment of short sequences with indels,
but had a steady decline when the length of the sequence
containing indels was increased. Although Dialign-T
developers claim that the program's new implementation
generates better results than version 2.2, this could not be
seen in our results. In the simulated sequence analysis,

Dialign-T was inconsistent, sometimes as accurate as Clustal W, while otherwise comparable to or worse than
Dialign2.2. Dialign-T's accuracy was originally tested
solely on alignment databases (BAliBASE v2.1 and IRMbase) [29]. When evaluated against a more diverse collection of protein sequences one can see that the program
does not fare as well as claimed initially.
Apparently, programs that have a tree-building step in
their alignment procedure seemed to produce better
results than programs that do not build a phylogenetic
tree or cluster in their alignment process. Of the bottom
four performers, only Clustal W builds a Neighbor Joining
tree to guide the multiple sequence alignment. According
to POA developers, their program is more suited for alignment of multidomain sequences, and a way to improve
the algorithm would be to use a Clustal-like progressive
alignment with a guide tree [20]. Also, our results demonstrate that POA had the tendency to insert large gaps on
the sequences' terminal regions, which inflated the average number of gaps per sequence. This led to the low accuracy values generated by POA and a visual inspection of a

considerable number of resulting sets revealed that the
intermediary regions of the alignments were consistent
with other packages results. It was also shown before that
global alignment programs usually perform better than
local alignment algorithms such as Dialign2.2 and Dialign-T [33]. These two programs seemed to be more suitable to align sequences with high local similarities that
were shuffled by recombination. Both programs were
among the least conservative in inserting gaps, which may
explain the low alignment accuracy values obtained.
Among the programs that use a guide-tree in their multiple alignment procedure, hierarchical clustering outperformed UPGMA with modified linkage (in Mafft's noniterative approach), Neighbor Joining and UPGMA (Muscle and Kalign). Clustal W had the lowest accuracy in the
group but in many cases it outperformed the programs
that lack tree-building capabilities, probably because of its
profile alignment procedure. Kalign, that uses UPGMA
(Neighbor Joining is an option) had superior results in

comparison to Clustal W, what might be explained by the
distinct algorithm that calculates pairwise distances. TCoffee showed better accuracy than Clustal W and Kalign,
maybe because of the incorporation of Lalign alignments
in its algorithm, that improved the pairwise alignment
generated by a Clustal W-like process. At the same time,
Muscle performed as well as T-Coffee and Mafft FFT-NS-2,
showing that all tree-building methods might be equivalent. UPGMA with modified linkage had an edge when
the iterative capabilities of Mafft were employed. Finally,
hierarchical clustering, which does not incorporate biological concepts in its calculation, was better than the
biology-based tree determination methods in some the
tested scenarios.
Regarding factors that influence alignment accuracy, indel
number is surely the one with the largest effect. The overall performance of all programs decreased proportionally
to the increase in gap frequency and to a lesser extent indel
size. This was shown by increasing indel frequency alone,

indel length alone and both combined. Among these two
parameters, indel number seems to have more consequences to accuracy loss than indel length alone, maybe
because most alignment algorithms have a tendency to
merge gaps. Larger evolutionary distance plays a role in
the quality of MSA, and this might be related to an
increased number of indel events with longer branch
lengths. In cases with both low indel frequency and
length, sequences were aligned by all packages accurately
even for simulations based on trees with long branches.
These results show that some alignment programs tend to
be conservative with respect to inserting gaps as the loss of
accuracy is mainly due to inferred alignments having
fewer and shorter gaps than the known alignments.
Although different programs have distinct allowances for
terminal gaps we showed that terminal gaps did not have

a large effect on alignment accuracy, regardless of their
length.

Conclusion
Our analysis reveals that Mafft is the best choice for protein sequence alignment, based on its overall alignment
quality and processing speed. Other algorithms, however,
cannot be dismissed as they showed very good results for
some evolutionary scenarios. By comparing accuracy and
date of publication of the programs (Figure 1), it seems
that overall alignment quality has generally improved
over time, but there is still room for improvement as
alignment accuracy is still fairly low in many cases.
With the advent of Simprot, there is another alternative to
assess MSA performance. Our study shows that Simprot

and simulated sequences present a reliable approach to
check alignment quality. This methodology proved to be
more flexible and able to generate a broader range of
alignment classes in comparison to methods used in the
past. Although the final conclusions were similar while
using our method and BAliBASE sets of protein alignments, our methodology allows us to determine with
more detail the strengths and weaknesses of each alignment program and its algorithmic approach. Simprot also
proved to be a suitable alternative for alignment quality
testing. In conclusion, the ability to create large simulated
alignment sets in seconds, with full control of its characteristics, allows a quick and reliable analysis of different
evolutionary histories, some of them not available in the
current database sets.

Methods
BAliBASE
All five BAliBASE data sets, including sub-references, were
aligned using the nine programs described above and the
obtained alignment compared to the original alignment
file provided. Accuracy was measured for each alignment
and the average of each program was compared separately
for each reference and overall for the whole database. A
Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used to assess statistical
significance of the results.
Simprot simulated sequences
Simprot was used to simulate sets of protein sequences in
different evolutionary conditions. This simulation program requires a phylogenetic tree as its initial input in
order to generate a file with the known alignment which
is determined from the known evolutionary history of the
sequences. In this study, we used five different bifurcating
trees, attempting to include general scenarios of evolution
with distinct topologies and characteristics in trees
obtained from protein MSA and trees created artificially
(Figure 2). Two of these trees, tree B (44 taxa) and tree C
(20 taxa) were obtained based on PFAM alignments [34].
Artificial trees, D and E, both with 16 taxa, had identical
topologies and maximum evolutionary distance, differing
on when and where evolution had occurred. Finally, tree
A also contained 16 taxa in a bifurcating topology, with a
large monophyletic clade of 12 taxa and a small sister
clade of four taxa. All branches were of equal length except
at the node that supported the larger clade, which was
twice the size of the other branches.
Alignment accuracy evaluation
Another critical step when comparing the results from different algorithms is the alignment scoring. There are many
scoring functions available. BAliBASE creators also have
introduced two distinct scores for the comparison of an
alignment against a reference set: column score (CS) and
sum-of-pair score (SP) [33]. The SP score is defined as the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/471

number of correctly aligned residues pairs that are found
in the test alignment divided by the total number of
aligned residue pairs of the reference alignment, increasing with the number of sequences aligned correctly. SP
calculation takes into account pairs of aligned residues
occurring in both MSA, while the CS calculation only
checks for identical columns in each set of aligned
sequences. SP is also known as fD, the developer's score
[35,36]. A third option is the modeler's score (fM) which
indicates the fraction of residue pairs in the test alignment
that are correctly aligned in comparison to the reference
[37].
Alignment accuracy, either for BAliBASE sequences or
Simprot simulated sequences, was measured using the
developer's score and the modeler's score [35]. Both
scores are calculated as

fD =

c
c
, fM =
r
t

where c number of residue pairs in the test alignment that
are correctly aligned with respect to the reference alignment, r number of aligned residue pairs in the reference
alignment and t number of aligned residue pairs in the
test alignment. Both scores have a maximum value of 1
(all pairs correctly aligned), and a minimum equal to 0
(no pairs are correctly aligned). The developer's and modeler's scores have been the most widely used in alignment
score assessment and were featured in a comparison of
profile alignment scoring by Edgar and Sjölander [38].
The two alignment scoring functions tested yielded very
similar results. In most cases, the modeler's score resulted
in a value slightly lower than the developer's score, while
in very few cases a modest improvement was observed.
We therefore decided to present here only the results
obtained using the developer's score.
Performance evaluation
All programs' performance was also tested in aligning
sequences of different sizes. We did not evaluate the speed
variation regarding the number of input sequences, due to
restrictions in some programs in aligning large numbers
of sequences. Using Simprot's default parameters and tree
B (44 taxa) as input, ten sets of simulated protein
sequences were generated in seven lengths: 100, 200, 300,
400, 500, 1000 and 1500 amino acids. Total CPU time,
calculated by the system time command was averaged. All
programs were run in a dual 3.0 Ghz Xeon with 4 GB of
memory, running openMosix with Linux kernel 2.4.22.
