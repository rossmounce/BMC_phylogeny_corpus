Abstract
Background: The rate of nucleotide substitutions is not constant across the Tree of Life, and
departures from a molecular clock have been commonly reported. Within parmelioid lichens, the
largest group of macrolichens, large discrepancies in branch lengths between clades were found in
previous studies. Using an extended taxon sampling, we test for presence of significant rate
discrepancies within and between these clades and test our a priori hypothesis that such rate
discrepancies may be explained by shifts in moisture regime or other environmental conditions.
Results: In this paper, the first statistical evidence for accelerated evolutionary rate in lichenized
ascomycetes is presented. Our results give clear evidence for a faster rate of evolution in two
Hypotrachyna clades that includes species occurring in tropical and oceanic habitats in comparison
with clades consisting of species occurring in semi-arid and temperate habitats. Further we explore
potential links between evolutionary rates and shifts in habitat by comparing alternative OrnsteinUhlenbeck models.
Conclusion: Although there was only weak support for a shift at the base of a second tropical
clade, where the observed nucleotide substitution rate is high, overall support for a shift in
environmental conditions at cladogenesis is very strong. This suggests that speciation in some
lichen clades has proceeded by dispersal into a novel environment, followed by radiation within that
environment. We found moderate support for a shift in moisture regime at the base of one tropical
clade and a clade occurring in semi-arid regions and a shift in minimum temperature at the base of
a boreal-temperate clade.

Background
Differences in nucleotide substitution rates among taxa
are a common phenomenon in molecular studies [1-7],
and the presence of an exact molecular clock [8,9] appears
to be a rare exception in molecular evolution, if present at

all. A number of different causes are invoked to explain
differences in evolutionary rates among taxa. Recently,
Kay et al. [10] demonstrated correlations of substitution
rates and life histories. In angiosperms, herbaceous plants
have substitution rates almost twice as high as woody

plants [10], while no phylogenetic constraint on rates was
found in their study among lineages. Previously, higher
substitution rates had been found in annual compared to
perennial plants [5,11-14]. These studies in plants agree
with previous studies suggesting that shorter generation
times are associated with accelerated evolutionary rates
[15,16].
Significant departure from constant rates of a molecular
clock have so far only been demonstrated for the kingdom
Fungi in Basidiomycota [17,18] and in four endosymbiotic pyrenomycetes [6]. In these cases accelerated evolutionary rates were significantly associated with
mutualism. In one of the largest classes of Ascomycota,
Lecanoromycetes [19,20], significant differences in nucleotide substitution rates have not yet been shown. However, in previous studies [21,22] we have found
remarkable differences in branch lengths between clades
in parmelioid lichens (Parmeliaceae, Lecanoromycetes).
Taxa of one clade (the Hypotrachyna clade) had consistently longer branches in phylogenetic trees than taxa in
other clades, which suggested an accelerated evolutionary
rate in that group.
Parmelioid lichens are the largest group within Parmeliaceae [23], which itself is one of the largest families of
lichen-forming fungi and has a worldwide distribution.
The Parmelioid group comprises common and wellknown species, including taxa such as Parmelia sulcata,
Flavoparmelia caperata, and Punctelia borreri, which are frequently used in biomonitoring atmospheric pollution
[24,25]. The group has approximately 1500 taxa [26,27].
It includes species which are mainly foliose, mostly rhizinate lichens with laminal apothecia and simple, hyaline
ascospores [28]. Recent phylogenetic studies have shown
that a core group of parmelioid lichens is monophyletic
[21-23]. Within this group, seven well-supported clades
were found [21], which show distinct ecological preferences. For example, taxa belonging to the Hypotrachyna
clade (c. 300 species) are mostly tropical extending into
temperate regions in moist, oceanic habitats [29-31]. In
contrast, species of the Xanthoparmelia clade (c. 700 species) [32,33] have their center of distribution in semi-arid
regions.
Lichens are poikilohydric organisms and are able to survive long periods of dry conditions in a dormant stage
[34-40]. They lack stomata and any water storage system.
Water vapor is lost readily from across the whole surface
of lichens. In some lichens, alteration between desiccated
and hydrated stages is an almost daily occurrence [41-44].
This has an important ecological consequence, since the
duration of physiological activity of lichens is directly
dependent on the ability of water in a habitat. Lichens in
dry habitats may be physiologically active only for a few

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/257

hours a day and dormant most of the day [45-49], while
lichens growing in moist habitats usually have sufficient
water content all day long for physiological activity [5052].
To further investigate the remarkable differences in
branch lengths between species of the Hypotrachyna clade
(including tropical species extending into temperate
regions in moist, oceanic habitats) and other clades of
parmelioid lichens [21] we obtained sequence data from
additional species and/or genes to perform a study focusing on the differences in evolutionary rates within
parmelioid lichens and potential causes for rate shifts.
Sequences of two nuclear (ITS, nu LSU) and single mitochondrial ribosomal (mtSSU) DNA loci are used to infer
phylogenetic relationships. These genes have been successfully used to infer phylogenies in parmelioid lichens
[21,29]. Here we use a phylogenetically based maximum
likelihood procedure to identify shifts in rates of nucleotide substitutions. Further we explore the potential links
between rates of molecular evolution and ecological
parameters by comparing alternative Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
models [53]. These models allow us to test the hypothesis
that cladogenesis in parmelioid lichens is associated with
shifts in habitat that might in turn explain changes in
nucleotide substitution rate.

Results
Phylogenetic Analysis
Phylogenetic analyses of the three gene partitions combined included 2022 unambiguously aligned nucleotide,
of which 734 were variable and 563 were parsimony
informative. The topologies of the Bayesian analysis (Figure 1) and MP results were generally similar and all nodes
strongly supported by MP bootstrapping (≥75%) were
well supported by Bayesian pp (MP tree not shown). All
strongly supported clades are also supported in the
relaxed-clock analyses conducted in BEAST (data not
shown). Our results were largely consistent with previous
phylogenies [21-23,29,54], but with the addition of several new taxa and/or an additional gene partition. The
species were placed within groups expected by their morphological and chemical characters [21,28,30,31]. However, the placement of some taxa differed slightly from
previous analysis. This includes Parmelinella wallichiana,
which had an unresolved sister-group relationship to Bulbothrix decurtata and a clade including B. meizospora and B.
setschwanensis; Everniastrum, which was resolved as monophyletic in previous analyses; and a few relationships of
terminal sister taxa [29]. None of the differences to previous studies involve well supported conflicts. Further, the
close relationship of Karoowia saxeti with Xanthoparmelia
found in previous studies [21,32] is confirmed and its
placement within that genus is strongly supported for the
first time.

Significant Rate Differences
Between major clades of parmelioid lichens considerable
branch length differences were evident, but also within
clades branch lengths differed (Figure 1). Likelihood ratio
tests comparing null models of rate constancy versus alternative models revealed statistically significant departures
from rate constancy across the entire tree (Additional file
1). Since some of the well supported clades included only
a few OTUs, we restricted our analysis to five clades with
sufficient number of taxa (more than six OTUs). Within
these five clades selected for the rate difference test, analyses of three of 15 single-gene data sets did not return significant results, meaning that a molecular clock cannot be
rejected. This includes the ITS data sets of the Melanohaleaand Xanthoparmelia clades, and the mtSSU data set of the
Parmotrema clade.

To determine rate differences between clades and to identify particular clades with deviating rates, two-rate and
three-rate models were compared for three selected clades
in each analysis using the likelihood ratio test statistics.
Significant rate differences were found between the
Hypotrachyna clades 1 and 2 and other clades examined
(Additional file 1). Rate comparisons of the Melanohalea
clade with the Parmotrema and Xanthoparmelia clades,
respectively, and comparisons of the latter two clades
revealed insignificant results.
Habitat Shifts
The species of the five selected clades live under different
ecological conditions (Table 1). On average, the species in
the two Hypotrachyna clades occur at higher altitudes.
Moreover, these and the species of the Parmotrema clade
occupy habitats with higher precipitation and consequently have the highest Emberger Index values. In contrast, species in the Xanthoparmelia and Melanohalea clades
occur in habitats with low precipitation and low
Emberger's index.

There is moderate support for a shift in moisture regime
(represented by precipitation and Emberger's Index) at
the base of Hypotrachyna clade 2 and the Xanthoparmelia

clade, and strong support for a shift in minimum temperature at the base of the Melanohalea clade. In the local test
of alternative Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models (O-U models;
the models and our 'local' and 'global' tests are described
in the methods section), a shift in precipitation at the base
of Clade 2 is supported with Bayes information criterion
(BIC) weight = 0.876, and a shift in Emberger Index is
supported at BIC weight = 0.842 (Table 2). A shift in
Emberger's Index at the base of the Xanthoparmelia clade is
similarly supported (BIC weight = 0.895). A shift in minimum temperature is very strongly supported at the base
of the Melanohalea clade under both the local and global
tests and whether measurement error is accounted for or
not (BIC weight > 0.98; Tables 2 &3). These findings argue
against a gradual shift in moisture regime in which the
covariance among taxa is predicted by time since divergence from their most recent common ancestor. Rather,
they support a scenario in which transitions in moisture
regime are associated with cladogenetic events. In both
the global and local tests of maximum temperature and
altitude, the Brownian motion or single-equilibrium O-U
model cannot be rejected (Tables 2 &3).
Incorporating estimated measurement error decreases the
relative support for the two-equilibrium O-U models in
the local test (e.g., BIC weight = 0.567 and 0.276 for precipitation and Emberger's Index respectively for Hypotrachyna clade 2 when measurement error is accounted for;
Table 2). In the global test, incorporating measurement
error into analysis has little effect on the evidence for a
change in moisture regime at the base of clade 2, which is
supported at BIC weight = 0.897 to 0.905 either with or
without measurement error (Table 3). The model-averaged estimate of α for Emberger's Index is 16.447 when
measurement error is incorporated, 19.015 when it is not
(Additional files 2, 3). This has the effect of almost erasing
the phylogenetic effects in the data. When measurement
error is disregarded (treated as zero), there is little support
for a Brownian motion model for any characters except
minimum temperature (Table 2). In the global analyses of
precipitation and Emberger's Index, the 99% confidence
interval excludes both the Brownian motion model and

For each variable, 7 models were evaluated: five dual-equilibrium O-U models corresponding to a single change in environment at the base of each
of the five indicated clades; the single-equilibrium O-U model, in which all clades are modelled as occurring in a single environment; and the
Brownian motion (constant variance) model. Values in each cell are Bayes information criterion (BIC) weights for: the dual-equilibrium O-U model/
the single-equilibrium O-U model/the Brownian motion model. The first value is interpreted as the posterior probability that the origins of the
clade were associated with a shift in environmental parameters. Measurement error for the lower portion of the table was estimated as indicated in
the text.

the single-moisture-regime O-U model (Table 3, Additional files 2, 3). When measurement error is ignored,
there is concordance between the local and global tests.

Discussion
Our extended sampling revealed phylogenetic estimates
congruent with previous analyses [21,29] including several well-supported clades within parmelioid lichens.
However, as in these studies, we failed to resolve with con-

fidence the phylogenetic relationships between these
strongly supported main clades. Further, additional sampling of the Hypotrachyna clade supported that it includes
two major clades. In contrast to Blanco et al. [21], but in
agreement with Divakar et al. [29], the sister-group relationship between the two Hypotrachyna clades is not
strongly supported, and in the Bayesian analysis using
Beast, the two clades do not form a monophyletic group.

For each variable, 33 models were evaluated: 32 O-U models comprising all 2^5 possible models allowing or disallowing shifts in equilibrium value
at the base of the 5 focus clades; and the Brownian motion (constant variance) model. Values in each cell are Bayes information criterion (BIC)
weights summed over all models allowing a change at the node indicated. This estimates the posterior probability that there was a shift in
environmental conditions at the base of the clade estimated integrating over all models evaluated. Measurement error for the lower portion of the
table was estimated as indicated in the text.

between the clades is consistent with the scenario of an
adaptive radiation at the base of parmelioid clade. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of a lack of power
of resolution in the gene partitions used in the analyses.
This study provides clear evidence for a general acceleration in rates of molecular evolution in the two Hypotrachyna clades in comparison with other clades in parmelioid
lichens. Although this study presents the first statistical
evidence for a significantly accelerated substitution rate in
the Hypotrachyna clades, a prior study showed its occurrence without discussing this further [21]. The increased
rates of nucleotide substitution seen could result from different factors, such as positive selection on coding regions
of the ribosomal DNA, or represent a general acceleration
of nucleotide substitutions [18]. Our analyses point to the
latter as the most plausible cause.
Positive selection is the process favouring the retention of
mutations in a population that are beneficial to the reproductive success of individuals [55]. Positive selection leading to increased fixation of nonsynonymous substitutions
has been demonstrated for some parasites [56,57]. To
examine the possibility of this process on coding regions
of the ribosomal DNA, we examined the rate increase in a
conserved part of the ITS regions (199 bp long) and compared it to the rate increase in the 5.8 S rDNA and nu LSU
rDNA. If faster substitution rates were caused by differential selection, there should be no association between
faster evolutionary rates and affiliation to the Hypotrachyna clades. However, we found higher rates in the Hypotrachyna clades in all three- gene partitions studied (data not
shown). There were no significant differences between the
rate increases between the gene partitions, indicating that
positive selection on coding regions is not present.
Another possible cause of rate acceleration is an increase
in mutation rate [58]. Our results indicate a general acceleration of nucleotide substitutions in the Hypotrachyna
clade (see branch lengths, Figure 1). Causes for such an
acceleration could be numerous, including shorter generation time [59], metabolic rate [60,61], lack of sexuality
[62], or demographic factors [15,62].
A population bottleneck may result from a significant
reduction of population size due to extinction of many
genetic lineages. Since mutations have a higher probability of fixation in populations experiencing genetic bottlenecks, this may result in a long branch leading to a clade
[6,63]. In fact, branches leading to Hypotrachyna clade 1
and 2 are long. However, this interpretation fails to
account for the general rate acceleration in the Hypotrachyna clades. Populations of species in these two clades are
not smaller and species do not have more restricted distributions than in other clades (PKD, unpubl. observations).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/257

The loss of sexual reproduction has been identified as a
cause of accelerated evolution in endosymbiotic bacteria
[62,64]. Since the ratio of asexual/sexual species in the
Hypotrachyna clades does not differ from other clades
(0.29, 0.55 in Hypotrachyna clades and 0.27, 0.5, 1.25 in
other clades), this explanation is also not likely.
Two intrinsic biological variables, generation time and
metabolic rate, have been interpreted as causes of rate variations in other organisms [60,61,65-68]. Since rates of
DNA damage are proportional to specific metabolic rate,
species with higher metabolic rates should have higher
substitution rates given there is a relationship between
DNA damage and mutation rate [63]. Unfortunately,
there are no ecophysiological measurements available for
the lichen clades studied. Hence, we have no data on metabolic rates in these fungi. However, as mentioned above
lichenized fungi are poikilohydric organisms and from
studies in other groups of lichens, we can assume that species occurring in arid and semi-arid regions are dormant
for large parts of their life [45,49,69]. For example, Teloschistes capensis (Teloschistaceae) occurs in the same habitats along the Namibian and north-western coast of South
Africa as some taxa of the Xanthoparmelia clade studied
here. This species has been shown to be physiologically
active for only very few hours in the mornings after dew
fall [48]. In contrast, species in moist habitats, such as
rainforests were shown to be physiologically active
throughout the day [51,52,70]. Growth measurements in
lichens from arid and semi-arid regions revealed that
these lichens grow very slowly (0.37 mm/y in Caloplaca
aurantia, Teloschistaceae) [46] and hence reach an age of
several hundred years, while some lichens in moist habitats, such as coastal forests of California can increase their
length over 35% per year [71] and have a much shorter
generation time. The slow rates of mutations in Xanthoparmelia clade may be related with a strategy adapted to a
low metabolic activity due to long dormancy periods in
dry conditions. Again, we have no data from the
parmelioid lichens studied here and point out that ecophysiological studies need to be extended to these lichens
to confirm their general importance.
Given our knowledge of the differences in growth rate and
generation time for these poikilohydric lichens in moist
vs. arid regions, we hypothesized at the outset of this
study that a shift in moisture regime might explain the
increased nucleotide substitution rate in Hypotrachyna
clades 1 and 2. This might be due either to decreased generation time or increased mutation rate in environments
with generally higher precipitation than in the other three
clades. The support for O-U models that specify shifts in
moisture regime (Emberger's Index and precipitation) at
the base of Hypotrachyna clade 2 and minimum temperature at the base of clade 5 (Melanohalea), combined with

weak support for the Brownian motion model and singleenvironment Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model for these variables, suggests that these clades originated by colonization
of a novel environment, followed by diversification
within those environments. The extreme phylogeny-effacing effects of the high inferred rate of evolution toward
equilibrium Emberger index values particularly suggests
that shifts in clade-specific moisture regimes govern the
evolution of habitat preferences in these lichens. There is
support for a change in moisture regime at the base of
Hypotrachyna clade 1 (BIC weight = 0.760 without measurement error, 0.803 with error; Table 3), which is comparable to the support for a change at the base of
Hypotrachyna clade 2. These two clades have an accelerated
substitution rate. However, the support for a change is
also approximately the same for the Parmotrema clade
(BIC weight = 0.763 without error, 0.806 with error),
which does not exhibit elevated substitution rate.
The apparently weak link between moisture regime and
substitution rate in this study may be due to a lack of
causal relationship. However, it might also be due to an
alternative adaptative strategy of the Parmotrema clade.
Species in this clade are especially abundant in insular
regions [72] with oceanic climate. Although no ecophysiological data on parmelioid lichens are available, other
lichens occurring in similar moisture conditions, were
shown to have metabolic (and growth) rates depending
on a combination of light intensity and temperature [73].
Most species in the Parmotrema clade may have slow metabolic rates due to ecological conditions related with latitude. In fact, Parmotrema clade species are subtropical or
temperate [28,74], living in regions where, comparing to
tropics, light intensity is lower. Wright et al. [75] showed
that evolutionary rates of tropical species are higher than
those of subtropical taxa. However, low sample size (inadequate number of taxa to accurately estimate the posterior
probability support for environmental shifts associated
with shifts in substitution rate) or inadequate characterization of the moisture environment cannot be discarded.
Additionally, in our observation (T.L. and A.C.), the moisture available to the lichens in this study is strongly dominated by fog, which is not directly accounted for by either
precipitation or Emberger's Index (though it is likely to be
correlated). In species occurring in areas with extensive
fogs, lichens were shown to be able to use this as the main
source of water taken up from water vapour [36,76].
Future work in the ecology of this group of organisms
should focus on characterizing moisture regime more
accurately.

Conclusion
Our extended taxon sampling confirmed phylogenetic
relationships revealed in previous studies. Here we show
significant accelerated evolutionary rates in clades of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/257

parmelioid lichens that occur in tropical and oceanic habitats as opposed to those in arid habitats. Comparison of
alternative Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models gave moderate
support for a shift in moisture regime at the base of one
tropical clade and a clade occurring in semi-arid regions
and a shift in minimum temperature at the base of a
boreal-temperate clade. This finding that cladogenesis
may be associated with shifts in environment suggests
adaptive radiation as a mechanism of speciation in
Parmelioid lichens, a hypothesis that bears testing using
finer-grained ecological data.

Methods
Taxon Sampling
Data matrices of 128 parmelioid lichens and three outgroup taxa were assembled using sequences of nuclear
LSU, ITS, and mitochondrial SSU rDNA sequences. Specimens and sequences used for the molecular analyses are
compiled in Additional file 4. The data set includes 11
sequences downloaded from GenBank, 343 from previous publications by us [21,23,29,32,74,77], and 39
sequences newly generated for this study. We used three
species of the genus Usnea as the out-group since this
genus has been shown to be closely related to parmelioid
lichens in a previous study [23].
Molecular methods
Small samples prepared from freshly collected and frozen
specimens were ground with sterile plastic pestles. Total
genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini
Kit (Qiagen, Hilden) according to the manufacturer's
instructions but with slight modifications as described
elsewhere [22]. Fungal nu LSU rDNA was amplified using
the primers nu-LSU-0155-5' [78], LR0R (Vilgalys unpublished,
http://www.botany.duke.edu/fungi/mycolab),
LR5, LR6 and LR7 [79] and mt SSU rDNA using the primers mrSSU1, mrSSU3R [80], MSU1 and MSU7 [81].

Amplifications were performed in 50 μl volumes containing 5–25 ng of DNA and a reaction mixture of 5 μl 10×
DNA polymerase buffer (Biotools) (containing MgCl2 2
mM, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA,
0.1% Triton X-100), 1 μl of deoxinucleotide triphosphate
(dNTPs), containing 10 mM of each base, 2.5 μl of each
primer (10 μM) and 1.25 μl of DNA polymerase (1 U/μl).
The amplifications were carried out in an automatic thermocycler (Techne Progene) and performed using the
same programs as described in [82]. The PCR products
were then cleaned using the Bioclean Columns kit
(Biotools, Madrid) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The cleaned PCR products were sequenced
using the same primers as used for PCR amplification. The
ABI Prism™ Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City) was used and
the following settings were applied: denaturation for 3

min at 94°C, 25 cycles at 96°C for 10 sec, 50°C for 5 sec,
and 60°C for 4 min. Sequencing reactions were electrophoresed on a 3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City). Sequence fragments obtained were assembled with SeqMan 4.03 (DNAStar, Madison) and manually adjusted.

was calculated using the sumt option of MrBayes. Posterior probabilities were obtained for each clade. Clades
with bootstrap support equal or above 75% under MP and
posterior probabilities ≥ 0.95 were considered as strongly
supported. Phylogenetic trees were visualized using the
program Treeview [92].

Sequence alignment
The mitochondrial and the ITS data sets contain sequence
portions that are highly variable. Standard multiple alignment programs, such as Clustal [83] become less reliable
when sequences show a high degree of divergence. Therefore we employed an alignment procedure that uses a linear Hidden Markov Model (HMM) as implemented in the
software SAM (Sequence Alignment and Modelling system) [84] for separate alignments of the three data sets.
Regions that were not aligned with statistical confidence
were excluded from the phylogenetic analysis.

Sequence Significance Test for the Presence of Rate
Differences
The program Baseml (part of the PAML 3.14 b package;
[93] was used for significance tests for the presence of rate
differences, assuming a GTR+G model. The resulting likelihoods were compared using likelihood ratio tests [94].
Two types of analyses were performed and the results of
those are listed in Table 1. In a first set of analyses, two
models were compared to determine whether observed
branch length differences were the result of a significant
departure from rate constancy. The null model assumed a
molecular clock, while in the alternative model each
branch was allowed its own unique rate of molecular evolution. These two models were contrasted for each gene
partition separately (ITS, mtSSU, nuLSU) across the whole
ingroup of parmelioid lichens, as well as across five
selected, well-supported major clades within parmelioid
lichens, which are Hypotrachyna 1, Hypotrachyna 2, Melanohalea, Parmotrema and Xanthoparmelia [21,29] to determine rate differences within these clades. In a second
analysis, several tests were performed to determine
whether significant departure from rate homogeneity
were present between the five selected clades. For these
analyses, a pruned tree comprising of the five selected
clades of parmelioid lichens was used for comparisons of
a null and alternative model. The five clades selected
included the two clades (Hypotrachyna clade 1 and 2) with
evidently long branches and the Xanthoparmelia clade that
has comparably short branches. Comparisons were made
between two-rate models in which two selected clades had
the same rate but a third clade had a different rate versus
a three-rate model in which all three included clades had
different rates. These analyses were made on the concatenated data set, and in total 30 analyses were performed.

Phylogenetic analyses
The alignments were analysed by maximum parsimony
(MP) and a Bayesian approach (B/MCMC) [85,86]. To
test for potential conflict, parsimony bootstrap analyses
were performed on each individual data set, and 75%
bootstrap consensus trees were examined for conflict [20].

Maximum parsimony analyses were performed using the
program PAUP* [87]. Heuristic searches with 1000 random taxon addition replicates were conducted with TBR
branch swapping and MulTrees option in effect, equally
weighted characters and gaps treated as missing data.
Bootstrapping [88] was performed based on 2000 replicates with random sequence additions.
The B/MCMC analyses were conducted using the MrBayes
3.1.1 program [89]. The analyses were performed assuming the general time reversible model of nucleotide substitution [90], including estimation of invariant sites and
assuming a discrete gamma distribution with six rate categories (GTR+I+G). The data set was portioned into the
three parts (ITS, nu LSU, mt SSU) and each partition was
allowed to have its own parameters [91]. No molecular
clock was assumed. A run with 3,000,000 generations
starting with a random tree and employing 12 simultaneous chains was executed. Every 100th tree was saved into a
file. The first 200,000 generations (i.e. the first 2000 trees)
were deleted as the "burn in" of the chain. We plotted the
log-likelihood scores of sample points against generation
time using TRACER 1.0 http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/soft
ware.html?id=tracer to ensure that stationarity was
achieved after the first 200,000 generations by checking
whether the log-likelihood values of the sample points
reached a stable equilibrium value [89]. Of the remaining
56,000 trees (28,000 from each of the parallel runs) a
majority rule consensus tree with average branch lengths

Phylogenetic Comparative Analyses
Estimates of five environmental variables – Emberger's
Index [95], altitude, precipitation, minimum temperature
and maximum temperature – were obtained for one to
three specimens of each of 97 species from three online
databanks
(http://www.ucm.es/info/cif/data/index
csp.htm,
http://climexp.knmi.nl/start.cgi?some
one@somewhere, and http://www.worldclimate.com/)
and are available in the additional file 4 and 5. The
Emberger's index including a combination of simple climate parameters such as the mean of minimal and maximal annual temperature and precipitation was calculated
by the formula Q = 100 × P/Tmmax2 - Tmmin2, where P is

average annual precipitation, Tmmax is average maximum
temperature of warmest month, Tmmin is average minimum temperature of coldest month.
Environmental variables were analyzed in a phylogenetic
generalized least squares framework under alternative
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U) models [53,96]. The O-U
process is essentially a Brownian motion model with a
pull toward an equilibrium that may be environment-specific or clade specific. The O-U process has been referred
to as a "rubber-band" process [97], because it models random, stochastic processes as well as deterministic evolutionary forces that pull character values toward a central
optimum or equilibrium value. Under this model, the
parameter α estimates the rate at which the variable being
analyzed reaches an equilibrium, and the parameter θi
estimates the equilibrium value of that variable along
branches in group i. Analyses were conducted allowing θ
to change at the base of each of five strongly supported
clades (Figure 1). This models the situation in which environmental conditions shift at the base of a clade, such that
the radiation of that clade takes place within a potentially
novel set of environmental conditions. Bayes information
criterion (BIC) weights were used to assess the support for
the hypothesis that each clade radiated under a novel set
of conditions relative to each of the five environmental
variables. BIC weights are interpreted as Bayesian posterior model probabilities assuming equal prior model
probabilities [98]. Strong relative support for a singleequilibrium O-U model or a Brownian motion model
(constant variance with respect to phylogeny) indicates
that the data do not support a shift in environmental conditions attending cladogenetic events. Emberger's Index
and precipitation were log-transformed and altitude was
square-root transformed prior to analysis. Transformations had little effect on the conclusions of this paper but
improved model fit in trial analyses by 400 to 600 loglikelihood units.
We evaluated the support for alternative hypotheses both
locally and globally. In local tests, we compared the fit of
three models for each dataset: a two-equilibrium O-U
model that allows a change in environment at the base of
a single clade; the single-equilibrium O-U model, in
which the entire tree comprises a single environmental
regime; and the Brownian motion model. In global tests,
we compared the fit of the Brownian motion model plus
all 5^2 = 32 possible O-U models, allowing changes at all
permutations of the five focus clades, and summed BIC
weights over these clades to estimate the global support
for a change in environment attending the origins of each
clade. This approach is analogous to model-averaging and
has proven useful as a means of estimating the posterior
probability of change occurring along a given phylogenetic branch [99]. Effects of the O-U α parameter on phy-

logenetic signal were visualized using the Geiger package
[100] in R 2.6.0 (R Development Core Team 2007).
Analyses were conducted on an ultrametric tree estimated
using the lognormal relaxed clock model [101] implemented in an MCMC framework in BEAST v1.4.5 [102],
using the Bayesian consensus as the start tree and a
GTR+I+G model of nucleotide substitution, with a total
run of 20,000,000 generations. Measurement error was
incorporated into analyses by adding an estimate of the
squared standard error for each environmental variable to
the diagonal of the variance-covariance matrix utilized in
generalized least squares computations [100]. Because the
small sample sizes (N = 1 to 3 samples per species)
increase uncertainty in the estimates of measurement
error, the squared standard error was estimated for each
environmental variable as the mean variance over all species represented by N = 3 samples, divided by the sample
size for each species separately. With such small samples,
measurement error in this study represented a substantial
component of the total variance in the tree, and analyses
incorporating measurement error were consequently
compared with analyses in which measurement error was
set at zero.
