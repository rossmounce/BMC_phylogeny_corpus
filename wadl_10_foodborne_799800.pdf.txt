Abstract
Background: Norovirus is often transmitted from person-to-person. Transmission may also be food-borne, but only
few norovirus outbreak investigations have identified food items as likely vehicles of norovirus transmission
through an analytical epidemiological study.
During 7-9 January, 2009, 36 persons at a military base in Germany fell ill with acute gastroenteritis. Food from the
military base’s canteen was suspected as vehicle of infection, norovirus as the pathogen causing the illnesses. An
investigation was initiated to describe the outbreak’s extent, to verify the pathogen, and to identify modes of
transmission and source of infection to prevent further cases.
Methods: For descriptive analysis, ill persons were defined as members of the military base with acute onset of
diarrhoea or vomiting between 24 December 2008, and 3 February 2009, without detection of a pathogen other
than norovirus in stools. We conducted a retrospective cohort study within the headquarters company. Cases were
military base members with onset of diarrhoea or vomiting during 5-9 January. We collected information on
demographics, food items eaten at the canteen and contact to ill persons or vomit, using a self-administered
questionnaire. We compared attack rates (AR) in exposed and unexposed persons, using bivariable and
multivariable logistic regression modelling. Stool specimens of ill persons and canteen employees, canteen food
served during 5-7 January and environmental swabs were investigated by laboratory analysis.
Results: Overall, 101/815 (AR 12.4%) persons fell ill between 24 December 2008 and 3 February 2009. None were
canteen employees. Most persons (n = 49) had disease onset during 7-9 January. Ill persons were a median of 22
years old, 92.9% were male. The response for the cohort study was 178/274 (72.1%). Of 27 cases (AR 15.2%), 25 had
eaten at the canteen and 21 had consumed salad. Salad consumption on 6 January (aOR: 8.1; 95%CI: 1.5-45.4) and
7 January (aOR: 15.7; 95%CI: 2.2-74.1) were independently associated with increased risk of disease.
Norovirus was detected in 8/28 ill persons’ and 4/25 canteen employees’ stools, 6/55 environmental swabs and 0/
33 food items. Sequences were identical in environmental and stool samples (subtype II.4 2006b), except for those
of canteen employees. Control measures comprised cohort isolation of symptomatic persons, exclusion of norovirus-positive canteen employees from work and disinfection of the canteen’s kitchen.
Conclusions: Our investigation indicated that consumption of norovirus-contaminated salad caused the peak of
the outbreak on 7-9 January. Strict personal hygiene and proper disinfection of environmental surfaces remain
crucial to prevent norovirus transmission.

Background
Noroviruses are highly infectious pathogens that can cause
relatively severe disease including vomiting and diarrhoea
with acute onset. Symptoms usually resolve within 2 or 3
days. The incubation period ranges from 6-48 hours.
Infections typically peak during the colder months [1,2].
Noroviruses are shed in high concentrations in faeces or
vomit of infected persons. Their infectious dose is low [3].
The main mode of transmission is person-to-person [4],
either faecal-orally or through aerosolised vomit. Indirect
transmission via contaminated food, water, or environmental surfaces may also occur [5].
Approximately 50% of all gastroenteritis outbreaks in
developed countries are caused by norovirus [1]. Globally, genotype (G) II-4 has been the predominant strain
in outbreaks [6-9]. Outbreaks are frequently noticed in
institutions such as hospitals, homes for the elderly and
on cruise ships [10-12]. Eating food in restaurants, canteens or at catered events has also been related to norovirus outbreaks [13]. However, only few norovirus
outbreak investigations which identified food items as
potential vehicles of norovirus transmission through an
analytical epidemiological study have been published
[14-19]. Furthermore, potentially low norovirus concentrations in incriminated food items or environmental
samples make detection difficult, due to a lack of sensitive and reliable testing methods [20,21].
In Germany, norovirus has been the most frequently
reported pathogen causing an illness since 2004. In
2008, 80% of all reported outbreaks were caused by norovirus, and 59% of all reported norovirus infections
occurred in clusters [22].
On 8 January 2009, the Bundeswehr Medical Service
(German Armed Forces) reported an outbreak of acute
gastroenteritis on a military base in Leipzig to the Robert
Koch Institute. This specific military base had 815 members, and five divisions were stationed there. A total of 36
persons had fallen ill on 7 and 8 January with vomiting
and diarrhoea. Food from the military base’s canteen was
suspected as the vehicle of infection. Norovirus was
assumed to be the infectious agent due to the reported
typical symptoms and the sudden onset of disease.
An outbreak investigation was initiated on 8 January
to describe the outbreak’s extent, verify norovirus as the
causative pathogen, identify mode of transmission and
source of infection, and to implement infection control
measures to prevent further cases.
Methods
Descriptive epidemiology

We collected information on demographics, clinical
symptoms, disease onset, and division memberships of
persons with acute gastroenteritis. All members from

Page 2 of 10

the military base are obliged to visit a doctor of the
Medical Service if ill. For this study, all persons with
diarrhoea or vomiting between 24 December 2008 and 3
February 2009 were retrospectively and prospectively
recorded. Data was entered in EXCEL (Microsoft 2003)
and analysed using Stata (Stata Statistical Software:
Release 10, Texas, USA). We described illnesses by
onset of disease, age, sex and clinical symptoms, and
calculated division-specific attack rates (AR).
Cohort study

In order to test the hypothesis that food items served in
the canteen were the vehicles of infection we conducted
a retrospective cohort study. Through the head of the
division, we distributed a self-administered standardised
questionnaire (see Additional file 1) on 9 January to all
247 members of the headquarters company and
informed about the purpose of the study. All potential
study participants were ≥ 18 years old. Study participation was voluntary. We assumed implicit informed consent when a completed questionnaire was returned. The
headquarters company was selected for the cohort study
because it was the only division entirely present at the
military base on the day of questionnaire distribution
and because it was representative of all military base
members regarding age and sex. The questionnaire
included information on symptoms, date and time of
symptom onset, and on the following possible exposures: food consumption on 5-7 January and contact to
ill persons or to vomit. This time period was chosen as
most likely to explain symptom onset on 5-9 January
assuming an incubation period of 6-48 hours. Exposures
on 3-4 January were not included in the exposure questionnaire as this was the final weekend of the Christmas
holidays during which only few members were present
at the military base.
Cases were defined as acute onset of diarrhoea or
vomiting in a military base member between 5 and 9
January 2009, without detection of a pathogen other
than norovirus in stools. We used EpiData software
(EpiData Association, Odense, Denmark) for data entry
and Stata (Stata Statistical Software: Release 10, Texas,
USA) for data analysis.
For each exposure, we calculated the relative risk (RR)
of becoming a case using the chi-square test and the
attributable fraction (AF, only if RR > 1). Identified risk
factors for illness and protective factors with a P value <
0.2 in the bivariable analysis were included in a multivariable logistic regression model to assess independent
association with illness. In a stepwise backward procedure, we excluded exposures with P > 0.1 from the
model. The exposure variable “contact to ill persons or
to vomit during the incubation period” was consistently

Wadl et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:30
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/30

kept in the model to adjust for possible person-to-person transmission.
In order to assess possible dose-response relationships
for food items independently associated with disease, we
calculated AR and performed the chi-square test for
trend.
Laboratory analyses
Human stool samples

We collected stool samples from persons with acute
gastroenteritis and from all canteen employees. Stool
samples were tested for norovirus and, if negative, for
Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens,
enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), adenoand rotavirus. For norovirus detection, stool samples
were ten-fold diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS,
pH 7.2) and centrifuged for 1 minute at 13,500 × g.
Viral nucleic acid was extracted from 140 μl of supernatant using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to manufacturer’s instruction.
Environmental swabs

On 9 January, we sampled various surfaces of the military base’s Medical Clinic facilities and cohort isolation
rooms, the mail administrating centre, the canteen’s
kitchen, as well as the living and working areas. Using
sterile swabs (VWR, Germany) moistened in PBS, 100
cm 2 of each environmental surface were wiped as
described elsewhere [23]. Viral RNA from environmental samples was extracted by direct elution of the swab
in the RNA-lysis buffer of the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini
Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and processed further according
to manufacturer’s instruction.
Food items

At German military base canteens, meal items are routinely sampled and samples are kept for 48 hours.
According to the instructions, sampling is performed
between preparation and distribution of food. The specific food items served and sampled in the canteen on 6
and 7 January were tested for norovirus if the results
from the analytical study suggested an independent
association with disease. Samples from food served on 5
January had already been discarded. For testing, we used
a method adapted from a previously reported elutionprecipitation protocol [24]. Viscous food samples such
as dressings and gravies were analysed using an ultrafiltration protocol [25]. Viral nucleic acid was extracted as
described above.
Molecular detection of norovirus

The extracted RNA was tested for norovirus by realtime reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) [26] in an ABI PRISM 7500 cycler using the
Quantitect Probe RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) permitting the differentiation between genogroup

(G) I and II. Positive samples were additionally amplified
by RT-PCR in the open reading frame 1 (ORF1) according to [27], and in the junction gene region between
ORF1 and ORF2 using the One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). As only GII was detected in this
outbreak, GII specific primers used for the amplification
within the ORF1/2 junction were NV 107c (sense, 5’AICCIATGTTYAGITGGATG, nt position 5007 to
5026) and NV 156 (antisense, 5’ - ACCKGCATAACCATTRTACAT, nt position 5387 to 5367) for the first
round, and NV107c and NV300/II (antisense, 5’CYAGGKGCYTGIACAAARTT, nt position 5266 to
5247, all positions according to GenBank AY485642) for
the second round PCR. The amplicons were separated
on ethidium bromide-stained 1.5% agarose gels and
visualised under UV light.
Sequence analysis

The amplicons of the ORF1 (213 bp) and the ORF1/2
junction region (215 bp) considered for sequence analysis were purified using the Qiaquick DNA purification
kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Amplicons of the ORF
1/2 junction region were directly sequenced using the
amplification primers of the second round PCR. Amplicons of the ORF1 region were sequenced using generic
norovirus primers MON431 and MON432 [27] or
cloned into pCR4-TOPO vector using the TOPO TA
Cloning Kit for Sequencing (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Cloned fragments were sequenced using the
M13 Forward primer (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany)
in an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems,
Carlsbad, California, USA). Sequence alignment to prototype sequences drawn from GenBank was performed
using CLUSTAL W and the NEIGHBOR JOINING and
DNADIST program of the Phylogeny Interference Package (PHYLIP) version 3.57c [28] or the MegAlign module of the DNASTAR software package (Lasergene,
Madison, USA).

Results
Descriptive epidemiology

Overall, 104 of 815 military base members (AR 12.8%)
fell ill with vomiting or diarrhoea between 24 December
2008 and 3 February 2009. Three norovirus-negative
persons shed rotavirus, Campylobacter and EHEC in
their stools, see laboratory results.
In the following, we describe the 101 ill persons without detection of any other pathogen than norovirus (Figure 1). The first person fell ill on 31 December, a
second one on 3 January, and two more on 5 January.
The number of ill persons peaked during 7-9 January (n
= 49) (Figure 2). Zero to six persons (median 1) per day
fell ill between 10 January and 3 February. Hereafter,
the outbreak ceased. The ill persons’ median age was 22
years (range: 18-64). Of 99 ill persons with available

(33.7%) ill persons suffered from both, vomiting and
diarrhoea. Vomiting only was reported by 32 (31.7%)
and diarrhoea by 35 (34.7%). Division-specific AR were
highest in the headquarters company (55 of 247, 22.3%)
and among staff of the Medical Clinic (8 of 44, 18.2%).
Cohort study

Overall, 178 of 247 (72.1%) persons from the headquarters company completed the questionnaire. Among
those, 160 stated the date of questionnaire completion:
31.9% completed it before 12 January (within seven days
after the earliest date of food consumption we queried
in our questionnaire), 64.4% before 15 January (within
seven days after the latest date of food consumption
queried) and further 3.8% until 22 January. Information
on non-responders was not available.
Overall, 27 persons met the case definition (AR
15.2%). Two persons fell ill on 5 January, eight on 7 January, 11 on 8 January and six on 9 January. In cases
with available information, the median duration of

illness was two days (range: one to four, n = 21), the
median duration of sick leave was four days (range: zero
to nine, n = 16) and four of eighteen were hospitalized
(22%). Cases and non-cases did not differ with regard to
age and sex (both median 24 years, range: 18-58, and
96% male).
Overall, 25 of 133 (18.8%) persons who ate any meal
at the military base’s canteen and two of 45 (4.4%) persons who did not eat there during 5-7 January met the
case definition (RR: 4.3; 95% CI: 1.1-17.4; P < 0.05). In
bivariable analyses, persons consuming any lunch during
5-7 January at the canteen had an increased risk of disease compared to those who did not. Eating breakfast or
eating dinner at the canteen, contact to ill persons or
vomit during the incubation period or staying at the
military base overnight were not associated with disease
(Table 1).
Hence, we performed a day-specific analysis restricted
to persons who ate lunch at the military base’s canteen
on any particular day during 5-7 January to identify
food items consumption of which was associated with

becoming a case. The inclusion of cases was limited to
those having consumed food in the canteen 6-48 hours
before disease onset. We excluded cases without information on the time of disease onset.
None of the 113 respondents potentially exposed during lunch on 5 January met the case definition.
During lunch on 6 January, 106 of 178 (59.6%) respondents were potentially exposed. Among those, 11 (AR
10.4%) met the case definition. Eating salad from a selfservice salad buffet was associated with higher risk of disease in bivariable and multivariable analysis (Table 2).

During lunch on 7 January, 108 of 178 (60.1%)
respondents were potentially exposed. Of those, 19 (AR
17.6%) met the case definition. In bivariable and multivariable analysis, consumption of salad was again associated with increased risk of disease (Table 3).
We assessed a possible dose-response relationship
between salad consumption and disease by including
only persons in our analysis who ate lunch at the canteen on all days between 5 and 7 January. The risk of
disease increased with the number of days on which
salad was consumed (Table 4).

She had cleaned the salad bar on 6 and 7 January. Norovirus sequences found in stool samples of these two persons belonged both to subtype GII.4-2006b but differed
between 1.4% and 2.4% from those detected in ill persons (Figure 3). Nucleotide sequences of the ORF1/2
gene region from one ill person and two canteen
employees were submitted to GenBank (accession numbers GU017736, GU017737, and GU017738).
The other two canteen employees shedding norovirus
did not work at the canteen in January 2009 at all.
EHEC was isolated in one other symptomatic canteen
employee. All other stool samples from canteen employees tested negative for bacterial or viral pathogens.

Within the entire cohort, persons eating salad (21 of
75, AR: 28.0%) had a 4.8-times higher risk (95% CI: 2.111.4; P < 0.001) of being a case than persons not consuming salad (6 of 103, AR: 5.8%). Among persons who
had lunch in the canteen on 6 and 7 January (n = 119),
the AR among salad consumers (16 of 65, 24.6%) was
4.4-times higher (95% CI: 1.4-14.4; P < 0.01) than
among non-salad eaters (3 of 54, 5.6%).
Laboratory results
Stool samples

Overall, 8 of 28 (28.6%) tested stool samples from ill
persons were norovirus genogroup II-PCR-positive.
Samples were taken between 12 January and 3 February, a median of 4 days after onset of illness (range 110 days). Only one sample per person was taken into
consideration. Sequencing of five randomly selected
specimens revealed an identical subtype (GII.4-2006b)
and identical nucleotide sequences in the polymerase
and the ORF1/2 gene region, respectively. Stool specimens from one ill person, respectively, tested norovirus-negative
but
positive
for
rotavirus,
Campylobacter or EHEC.
Stool samples of 4 of 25 canteen employees (16%)
taken during 12-29 January tested norovirus-positive.
Two of the norovirus-positive persons had worked in
the canteen’s kitchen between 5 and 7 January. One of
them reported to have suffered from nausea with onset
on 5 January. She had continued working through 6 January. The other reported not to have had any symptoms.

Environmental swabs

Norovirus was detected in 6 of 55 (10.9%) environmental samples taken on 9 January. Positive swabs stemmed
from the mail administrating centre (3 of 8 swabs positive: mail counter, mail collection box, doorknob), the
living or working areas (2 of 16: computer keyboard, toilet flush), and the cohort isolation rooms (1 of 12: doorknob). Norovirus was neither found in any swabs from
the kitchen (0 of 15) nor from the canteen employees’
toilets (0 of 4). Surfaces from the salad bar and the dining hall were not sampled. Since PCR products were
mostly too weak for confirmation by sequencing, only
three environmental samples (computer keyboard, mail
collection box and doorknob from the mail centre) were

Food items

None of the 33 tested food items was norovirus PCRpositive. Investigated food items included salads and
salad dressings.
Infection control measures

On 8 January, the heads of all five military divisions
were briefed on the outbreak and on preventive measures. Ill persons were either cohort isolated in assigned
rooms or went on sick leave for one week. Hand disinfectants were distributed to ill persons. Healthy persons
were sent home for two days (8 and 9 January) to interrupt the outbreak. Specific soldiers were designated and

instructed for cleaning and disinfection of areas contaminated with vomit and faeces.
The canteens’ kitchen was routinely cleaned on 8 and
9 January. On 9 January, the military unit responsible
for hygiene inspected the kitchen. Cleaning and disinfection was performed on 10 January using virucidal
agents. Canteen employees with positive stool samples
were excluded from work until tested negative for the
respective infectious agent.

was caused by norovirus of subtype II.4-2006b. The outbreak lasted for 5 weeks. Half of the illnesses occurred
within 3 days between 7 and 9 January, strongly indicating a point source of infection. Results of the cohort
study suggested food-borne transmission for most of
these cases. Eating any meal, having any lunch, and consuming salad from a self-service buffet at the military
base’s canteen were all highly associated with disease.
Frequency of salad consumption correlated positively
with risk of disease. Of the 27 cases identified in the
cohort study, 25 had eaten lunch and 21 had eaten salad
at the canteen supporting the hypothesis that infections
were acquired during canteen visits. Person-to-person
transmission was tested for but not identified as risk
factor for becoming a case. However, for the time period
before and after 5-9 January, both person-to-person and
environmental-to-person transmission is plausible. Norovirus outbreaks with initial food-borne transmission
further propagated by person-to-person or environmental-to-person transmission have been reported [1,29].
Our findings of a causal role for salad in this outbreak
are consistent with other studies in which salad had
been involved in norovirus transmission [1,17,19,30].
The salad which was mainly eaten raw might have been
contaminated during cultivation, harvest, or by food
handlers during preparation [21]. Alternatively, persons
shedding norovirus could have contaminated food items
or surfaces while serving themselves at the salad bar
[1,13]. Possible cross-contamination at salad buffets with
self-service might be prevented by offering already prepared and portioned salads in bowls.
All analysed food samples including salad were tested
norovirus PCR-negative. Reasons for the norovirus PCRnegative food samples could be the presence of substances inhibiting molecular detection such as phenolics
and polysaccharides, low virus concentration, or a heterogeneous distribution of viruses in the food. Other
studies confirm that norovirus detection in food items
remains challenging [31,32].
Norovirus genome sequence analysis suggests that all ill
persons belonged to the same outbreak. However, the specific source of contamination for the salad, the likely vehicle of infection, remains unclear. While norovirus genome
sequences from ill persons and environmental swabs were
identical, those from canteen employees differed slightly.
Therefore it its unlikely that canteen employees contaminated the salad. Since norovirus infections peak every
winter, occurrence of norovirus-infected persons in the
military base due to virus circulation in the general population is plausible. However, persons shedding several different norovirus strains at the same time have been
reported [33]. Hence, the two norovirus-positive canteen
employees might have been shedding the outbreak

Page 8 of 10

norovirus-strain without detection when samples were
taken one to four weeks after the start of the outbreak.
Norovirus-contaminated environmental surfaces might
have played a role in transmission. Their implication in
virus transmission has been documented in other studies [34-38]. In our investigation, surface contamination
was not restricted to the immediate environment of ill
persons which highlights the difficulties in identifying
and properly disinfecting all possible norovirus-contaminated environmental surfaces during outbreaks. We
were able to detect norovirus on various surfaces including a mail delivery box and a computer keyboard indicating widespread environmental contamination. This is
not surprising since many individuals experienced symptoms of norovirus infection while in the military base.
Noroviruses are able to persist in an infective state on
environmental surfaces for several days after initial contamination [39], e.g. on computers and telephones [40].
However, since the members of the five divisions
worked at different buildings and assumingly not everyone went e.g. to the mail administrating centre, the canteen is the more likely location of norovirus
transmission for the majority of cases.
The date of sampling might explain why environmental swabs from the canteens’ kitchen were norovirus
PCR-negative. Samples were drawn on 9 January. If the
contamination occurred on 6 or 7 January, norovirus
could have been already removed on 9 January due to
the daily regular cleaning.
Cases might have remembered information on food
consumption better than non-cases. Since we provided
the list of served food items in the questionnaire and
most participants completed the questionnaire within
ten days after possible exposure, we assume the impact
of recall bias as minor. Possibly, the low proportion of
norovirus PCR-positive cases was partly due to the ordinance of sick leave of one week for ill persons in contrast to special leave of two days for healthy persons.
This might have tempted some soldiers to pretend
being ill resulting in an overestimation of case numbers.
However, this potential non-differential misclassification
would probably have led to an underestimation of the
true association between salad consumption and risk of
disease. Another reason for the low proportion of norovirus PCR-positive cases could be that people did not
shed virus anymore at the time of sampling.
Generally, military bases provide good conditions for
epidemiological investigations: the source population is
distinct, soldiers are instructed to visit the same doctor
for medical advice, food samples are collected routinely
from each meal and are kept for 48 hours, and the military is well equipped for timely investigations, which is
especially helpful in food-borne disease outbreaks.

Early implemented preventive measures like cohort
isolation and sick leave for ill persons, special leave for
healthy military base members, distribution of hand disinfectants, cleaning and disinfection of the Medical
Clinic and the canteens’ kitchen as well as identification
and exclusion of norovirus PCR-positive canteen
employees from work may have successfully averted
further cases.
In addition to recommendations generally applicable to
outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis such as timely and sustained implementation of preventive measures, we derive
the following recommendations from the experience in
this outbreak. Surfaces that are touched by many people,
such as doorknobs or computer equipment, should be
cleaned and disinfected daily or more often than usual to
avert environmental-to-person transmission.
Protective measures should be communicated in oral
and written forms. Posters displayed clearly visible in
buildings with many passers-by should prompt military
base members and visitors to wash their hands with
water and soap and use disinfectants after toilet visits
and before food consumption. Adequate hand disinfectants should be placed next to sinks for both healthy
and ill persons.
As we found asymptomatic norovirus-shedding canteen employees, the implications of hand washing and
disinfection before handling food or touching surfaces
used for food preparation, especially after going to the
toilet, should be communicated more frequently to staff
members. If canteen employees fall ill, they must stop
working immediately. Resumption of work should be
earliest two days after remission of symptoms.
Sequence analysis of predominant norovirus genotypes
like GII.4 should be performed in order to identify
chains of infection. Further research on methods for
norovirus detection in food is needed.

Conclusions
Our investigation indicated that consumption of norovirus-contaminated salad caused the peak of the outbreak on 7-9 January. Strict personal hygiene and
proper disinfection of environmental surfaces remain
crucial to prevent norovirus transmission.
The timely initiated analytical epidemiological investigation proved valuable to identify the likely vehicle of
infection and to guide targeted intervention measures.
