Genome-wide identification and characterization
of ATP-binding cassette transporters in the
silkworm, Bombyx mori
Shumin Liu, Shun Zhou, Ling Tian, Enen Guo, Yunxia Luan, Jianzhen Zhang and Sheng Li*

Abstract
Background: The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily is the largest transporter gene family
responsible for transporting specific molecules across lipid membranes in all living organisms. In insects, ABC
transporters not only have important functions in molecule transport, but also play roles in insecticide resistance,
metabolism and development.
Results: From the genome of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, we have identified 51 putative ABC genes which are
classified into eight subfamilies (A-H) by phylogenetic analysis. Gene duplication is very evident in the ABCC and
ABCG subfamilies, whereas gene numbers and structures are well conserved in the ABCD, ABCE, ABCF, and ABCH
subfamilies. Microarray analysis revealed that expression of 32 silkworm ABC genes can be detected in at least one
tissue during different developmental stages, and the expression patterns of some of them were confirmed by
quantitative real-time PCR. A large number of ABC genes were highly expressed in the testis compared to other
tissues. One of the ABCG genes, BmABC002712, was exclusively and abundantly expressed in the Malpighian tubule
implying that BmABC002712 plays a tissue-specific role. At least 5 ABCG genes, including BmABC005226,
BmABC005203, BmABC005202, BmABC010555, and BmABC010557, were preferentially expressed in the midgut,
showing similar developmental expression profiles to those of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E)-response genes. 20E
treatment induced the expression of these ABCG genes in the midgut and RNA interference-mediated knockdown
of USP, a component of the 20E receptor, decreased their expression, indicating that these midgut-specific ABCG
genes are 20E-responsive.
Conclusion: In this study, a genome-wide analysis of the silkworm ABC transporters has been conducted. A
comparison of ABC transporters from 5 insect species provides an overview of this vital gene superfamily in insects.
Moreover, tissue- and stage-specific expression data of the silkworm ABCG genes lay a foundation for future
analysis of their physiological function and hormonal regulation.

Background
The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters form one of
the largest family of membrane proteins [1]. With 48 members in total, the ABC transporter family from animals was
first identified in the human genome [2]. Ranging from 28
to ~200 members, the ABC transporter family is present in
all organisms [3]. Based on sequence similarity of the ATPbinding sites, the 48 human ABC transporters can be classified into seven subfamilies (A to G, ABCA to ABCG).

The eighth subfamily (H) was defined following the analysis of the genome of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster
(Diptera) [2]. In addition to the fruitfly [2], the ABC transporters have been previously analyzed in another insect
species, the mosquito, Anopheles gambiae (Diptera), at the
genome-wide level [4].
The ABC transporters share highly conserved domains
known as nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). Each NBD
contains three characteristic motifs, including Walker A
box, Walker B box, and ABC signature C which links the
two Walker boxes [5]. NBD binds and hydrolyses ATP
and provides energy to transport molecules against concentration gradients. In addition to NBD, a eukaryotic

ABC transporter usually consists of one or two transmembrane domains (TMD). The ABC transporters which have
two NBDs and two TMDs are called full transporters,
whereas those with one NBD and one TMD are called half
transporters, which often constitute a functional unit by
forming a homo- or heterodimer [6].
According to their functions, the ABC proteins can be
classified as importers, exporters and non-transport proteins [7]. Importers and exporters are responsible for
transport of a wide variety of substances, whereas the
third class of ABC proteins are apparently not involved in
molecule transport but in cellular processes such as DNA
repair, translation or regulation of gene expression [8]. In
human, known functions of ABC transporters include
cholesterol and lipid transport, multidrug resistance, antigen presentation, mitochondrial iron homeostasis, and the
ATP-dependent regulation of ion channels. Mutations in
ABC genes have been associated with a range of disorders,
including cystic fibrosis, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes [9]. In insects, it has been shown that ABC transporters have roles in uric acid metabolism, development and
possibly in insecticide resistance [10]. Due to the importance of ABC transporters, several members of ABC transporters have been extensively studied in several model
insects, including the fruitfly and the silkworm, Bombyx
mori (Lepidoptera). One of the best studied insect ABC
transporters is White, which is a typical ABCG transporter
involved in pigment transport in insect eyes [11,12].
In a microarray study published previously [13,14], we
detected multiple silkworm ABC genes exhibiting possible
regulation by the molting hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone
(20E). To this end, we decided to identify and characterize
the silkworm ABC transporters at the genome-wide level.
Very recently, three silkworm ABC transporter subfamilies, including ABCB, ABCC and ABCG, were analyzed
regarding to their possible xenobiotic resistance [10]. In
this study, we have identified 51 putative silkworm ABC
genes in total and analyzed their phylogenetic relationships. Moreover, we have investigated their temporal and
spatial expression patterns using microarray and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), with focus on the ABCG
subfamily.

Results and Discussion
Identification of the silkworm ABC transporters

The NBDs of all the D. melanogaster ABC transporters
were used as queries for BLASTP search against the two
silkworm genome databases, SilkDB and KAIKObase.
Each potential silkworm ABC transporter was validated by
searching its known orthologs from the protein database
of NCBI and further searching its NBD and TMD with the
Pfam program. As a result, a total of 51 putative ABC
genes were identified in the silkworm genome. A previous
study has identified 56 ABC genes in D. melanogaster [2].

For comparative analysis, we also identified 68 ABC genes
from the flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera),
52 from A. gambiae (8 more compared to 44 in [4] due to
the updated mosquito genome), and 43 from the honeybee, Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera) (Table 1).
In SilkDB, 37 ABC genes have evidences of mRNA
expression with EST sequences, which were collected
from 36 cDNA libraries of multiple tissues during different developmental stages. Based on the EST information, BmABC010129 shows the highest transcript level
with 26 hits. The largest ABC transporter (1794 amino
acids) and the smallest one (280 amino acids) are
encoded by BmABC012789 and BmABC010825, respectively (Table 2).
Phylogenetic analysis of the silkworm ABC transporters

Each silkworm ABC transporter possesses one or two
conserved NBDs (Figure 1). We performed a multiple
sequence-alignment to construct a phylogenetic tree on the
basis of NDBs of the 51 silkworm ABC transporters. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that silkworm ABC transporters
can be divided into 8 subfamilies (A-H) with high bootstrap
values. The ABCC subfamily can be separated into 2
groups, one of which shares high similarity to the ABCB
subfamily (Figure 2). Among the 51 silkworm ABC transporters, there are 11 full transporters and 26 half transporters. The ABCA, ABCB and ABCC subfamilies contain full
transporters, whereas half transporters exist in 6 subfamilies rather than ABCE and ABCF (Figure 1). The 4 ABCE
and ABCF proteins lack of TMDs. One putative ABCB
transporter contains one NDB and two TMDs, while one
putative ABCC transporter contains two NDBs and one
TMD. In addition, we found that 8 silkworm genes encode
obvious NDBs show high similarity to ABC genes in the
silkworm and other organisms. For convenience, we
referred the 10 putative ABC proteins as incomplete ABC
proteins. The incomplete sequences of those ABC genes
might be because the genome of silkworm is not at completion and annotation of the entire genome is not complete.
For comparative analysis, we also constructed phylogenetic
trees for the ABC transporters from T. castaneum (Additional File 1: Fig. S1), A. gambiae (Additional File 2:
Fig. S2), and A. mellifera (Additional File 3: Fig. S3). Similarly, the ABC transporters in each insect species can be
divided into 8 subfamilies (A-H) (Table 1).
Genomic distribution of the silkworm ABC transporters

Of the 51 silkworm ABC genes, 50 are dispersed on 17
chromosomes and 1 on an unmapped scaffold. Gene
structures of the 51 silkworm ABC transporters show
high complexity with exon numbers ranging from 6 to 34
(Table 2). There are two major gene clusters located on
chromosomes 12 and 15, which contain 9 and 10 ABC
genes, respectively. In addition, chromosomes 10 and 22

each contain 4 ABC genes. Gene duplication is very
evident in chromosomes 12 and 15, also occurs in chromosomes 10, 17 and 26 by tandem duplication (Additional File 4: Fig. S4).
Characterization of the silkworm ABC transporter
subfamilies

Since the insect ABC transporters can be classified into 8
subfamilies (A-H), we characterized each subfamily in the
silkworm and four other insect species for comparison.
ABCA

The ABCA transporters in mammals perform critical
functions in the control of cellular lipid-transport processes [15], yet little is known about their physiological
functions in insects. Among the 6 silkworm ABCA genes,
BmABC007217, BmABC007218 and BmABC007221 are
closely located on chromosome 17. The silkworm ABCA
subfamily consists of 2 full transporters, 1 half transporter,
and 3 incomplete ABC proteins containing one single
NBD in each member. This subfamily includes two of the
largest ABC transporters encoded by BmABC012789
(1794 amino acids) and BmABC007221 (1747 amino
acids). In human, all ABCA transporters are full transporters [2]. In the plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, 11 are half
transporters and only one is a full transporter [16]. No
ABCA transporters have been identified in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae [17]. Interestingly, all the 9 ABCA
transporters in the mosquito, A. gambiae, are full transporters, whereas both full and half transporters exist in the
ABCA subfamily of the four other insect species, indicating that the ABCA subfamily varies greatly during evolution in insects and other organisms. In addition,
phylogenetic analysis reveals that 3 insect ABCA transporters, BmABC012789, AGAP010416 and TcABCA2, are closely related (bootstrap value of 99%), implying that they
are orthologs (Additonal File 5: Fig.S5).
ABCB

ABCB1 was the first human ABC transporter to be
cloned and characterized through its function to confer a

multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype to cancer, and
later studies revealed several more MDRs in the ABCB
subfamily [18]. Based on sequence similarity, the insect
ABCB transporters are thought to be involved in resistance to insecticides and other chemicals [10]. Among
the 8 silkworm ABCB genes, BmABC000725 and
BmABC000724 are closely distributed on chromosome 1
suggesting they were arisen by tandem duplication. The
hypothesis of gene duplication is supported by phylogenetic analysis of the ABCB subfamily, which indicates
that the two genes are closely related in evolution (Additonal File 6: Fig. S6). The silkworm ABCB subfamily consists of 4 full transporters, 3 half transporters, and 1
incomplete ABC protein. The same as other organisms,
the ABCB subfamily in all the 5 insect species consists of
both full and half transporters. The D. melanogaster
ABCB gene, Mdr49, has multiple functions. Disruption of
Mdr49 results in change of sensitivity to colchicines [19].
Mdr49 is not only involved in the transport of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons [20], but also controls germ cell
attractant [21]. The ABCB transporter encoded by
BmABC009452 is ~49% identical to that of Mdr49 in
sequence (Additonal File 6: Fig. S6), but whether
BmABC009452 and other silkworm ABCB genes are
involved in xenobiotic resistances requires further investigation [10].
ABCC

The mammalian ABCC family members, including several
multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP), are
involved in ion transport, toxin secretion, signal transduction, and other physiological functions [5]. It has been suggested that the insect ABCC transporters might be
important for xenobiotic resistance [10]. With 15 members
in total, ABCC is the largest ABC subfamily in the silkworm. Moreover, there are 31 putative ABCC transporters
in T. castaneum. Interestingly, 8 of the 15 silkworm ABCC
genes are located on chromosome 15 and 4 on chromosome 12. Phylogenetic analysis of the ABCC subfamily
within the 5 insect species reveals that many ABCC genes

belonging to the same insect species cluster together, indicating gene duplication is an active mechanism that generates high diversity in the ABCC subfamily in insects
(Additional File 7: Fig. S7). The silkworm ABCC subfamily
consists of 5 full transporters, 7 half transporters, and 3
incomplete ABC proteins. All the 14 ABCC transporters in
D. melanogaster are full transporters, whereas both full and
half transporters exist in the ABCC subfamily of the four
other insect species, supporting the evolutionary divergence of the ABCC subfamily in insects. The ABCC transporter encoded by CG10505 in D. melanogaster is

regulated by heavy metals via the metal-responsive transcription factor 1 and involved in biochemical detoxification of zinc and copper [22]. Although several silkworm
ABCC transporters have sequence similarity to the protein
encoded by CG10505 in D. melanogaster (Additional
File 7: Fig. S7), whether they might act as biochemical factors in the defense against toxins is unknown.
ABCD

The ABCD transporters are located to the peroxisome at
the subcellular level and involved in the import of fatty
acids and/or fatty acyl-CoAs into this organelle [23].

Figure 2 Phylogenetic tree of the silkworm ABC transporters. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using a neighbor-joining technique to
analyze the amino acid sequences of the nucleotide binding domain (NBD). Analysis was performed with the program package MEGA4.0. The
number at the branch point of the node represents the value resulting from 1000 replications and gaps were deleted with pairwise deletion
method.

Each of the 5 insect species consists of 2 half transporters
in the ABCD subfamily. The insect ABCD transporters
are separated into two distinct groups by phylogenetic
analysis (Additional File 8: Fig. S8), indicating that they
are evolutionarily conserved in insects.
ABCE and ABCF

The ABCE and ABCF proteins lack TMD and each member contains a pair of linked NBDs [24]. Most eukaryotes
have only one ABCE gene that is highly conserved during
evolution (Additional File 9: Fig. S9). Different from most

ABC transporters, their functions in cell biological processes are not related to transport. In human, ABCE1
was identified as an inhibitor of RNase L [25], whereas in
yeast, ABCE proteins play key roles in translation initiation [26]. The silkworm ABCE gene, BmABC010129
which shows the highest expression level based on the
EST information, is preferentially expressed in testis,
ovary and fat body. However, RNA interference (RNAi)mediated knockdown of BmABC010129 has no obvious
effects on RNase L expression [27].

Liu et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:491
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/491

ABCF proteins function in ribosome biogenesis, translational control, and mRNA export, and are not involved in
molecule transport [28]. The best-characterized ABCF
protein is the yeast GCN20 protein, which is involved in
the initiation and control of translation. In addition, mutations in GCN20 gene reduce eIF2a phosphorylation and
thus translation in the ribosome [29]. Later studies
revealed that ABCF1 physically interacts with eIF2 and
associates with the ribosome in an ATP-dependent manner [28]. Until now, the ABCF subfamily has not been studied in insects. The same as human and most of other
organisms, each of the 5 insect species consists of 3 ABCF
proteins, which are separated into 3 distinct groups by
phylogenetic analysis and genes in each group have high
similarity (Additional File 9: Fig. S9). These data suggest
that ABCE and ABCF subfamilies are highly conserved
during evolution in all living organisms.
ABCG

The reported ABCG transporters are half transporters.
Importantly, each ABCG transporter has a TMD at the
C-terminal region of NBD, showing a distinct structure
[1]. In human, members of the ABCG subfamily play key
roles in lipid transport across membranes. For example,
ABCG2 is an essential MDR and its activity is associated
with decreased efficacy of anticancer agents in several carcinomas. Apart from its role in cancer, ABCG2 has a
broad substrate specificity and its ability to transport
numerous diverse pharmaceuticals has implications for
the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and
toxicity profile of these compounds. In addition, ABCG2
plays a role in the normal physiological transport of urate
and haem [30]. The silkworm ABCG subfamily has 13
members, and 11 of them encode half transporters. Gene
duplication is evident in this subfamily by the localization
of gene paralogues or orthologs on chromosomes 5, 10, 12
and 22, which is further supported by phylogenetic analysis (Additional File 10: Fig. S10). The best-studied ABCG
genes are those encoding eye pigment precursor transporters, white, scarlet, and brown, in D. melanogaster [11].
BmABC002922 (Bmwh3) encodes an ortholog of D. melanogaster white. Polyadenylated Bmwh3 transcript of about
2.7 kb length is detected in eggs, Malpighian tubule and
pupal heads, but not in testes, posterior silk glands or fat
body cells [31]. Bmwh3 is responsible for the transportation of ommochrome precursors and uric acid into pigment granules and urate granules, respectively, and
Bmwh3 mutations cause white eyes, white eggs, and translucent larval skin [32]. BmABC002924 encodes an ortholog of D. melanogaster scarlet. In the silkworm, Scarlet
forms a heterodimer with White to transport ommochrome precursors [33]. BmABC002581 encodes an ortholog of D. melanogaster brown. In addition, phylogenetic
analysis revealed that BmABC010557 is orthologous to

Page 7 of 14

D. melanogaster E23 (CG3327) (Additional File 10:
Fig. S10), which is a 20E primary response gene that
represses 20E-mediated gene activation [12]. The potential
physiological function of the silkworm ABCG subfamily is
of interest.
ABCH

The ABCH subfamily was first identified in D. melanogaster and exists solely in arthropods [2]. The structure organizations of the ABCH and ABCG transporters are similar.
Each of the 5 insect genomes studied in this report has 3
ABCH genes. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the
ABCH genes are originated from a common ancestor
(Additional File 11: Fig. S11), yet their physiological functions remain unknown.
Tissue distribution analysis reveals some tissue-specific
ABC genes

In order to understand the possible physiological function and hormonal regulation of the silkworm ABC
genes in the future, we here analyzed the expression
patterns of all the silkworm ABC genes by microarray
data. With the exception of BmABC010557, all other
ABC genes have corresponding probes in the oligonucleotide chip [34]. We first investigated the spatial
expression patterns of the silkworm ABC genes on day
3 of fifth larval instar using the microarray data of tissue-specific expression [34]. The analysis revealed that
the expression of 24 ABC genes can be detected at least
in one of the selected tissues, including testis, ovary,
head, integument, Malpighian tubule, fat body, haemocyte, anterior and middle silk gland, and posterior silk
gland (Figure 3). Significantly, a large number of ABC
genes were highly expressed in the testis compared to
other tissues. It is known that more than one thousand
genes are expressed specifically in the testis [34]. However, whether all these testis-specific ABC transporters
are functionally important in this male organ is questionable and worthy of further investigation.
Some tissue-specific ABC genes were verified by qRTPCR in nine tissues, including fat body, midgut, testis and
ovary, wing disc, trachea, brain, Malpighian tubule, haemocyte, prothoracic gland, and silk gland, on day 2 and 5
of fifth larval instar and day 1 of prepupae. Besides the testis, the Malpighian tubule is the second tissue enriched
with ABC gene expressions. The Malpighian tubule serves
as the excretory and osmoregulatory organs for insects, in
which the urine is produced and transported to the hindgut for the selective absorption of water and ions. Thus,
the Malpighian tubule plays an important role in excretion
and it is also involved in xenobiotic detoxification [35].
BmABC002712, an ABCG gene, was exclusively and abundantly expressed in the Malpighian tubule, detected by
both microarray (Figure 3) and qRT-PCR (Figure 4),

Figure 3 Spatial expression patterns of the silkworm ABC genes in multiple larval tissues on day 3 of fifth instar. Normalized microarray
data (GSE17571) for gene expression in multiple tissues of silkworm larvae on day 3 of fifth instar was used to survey tissue-specific expression of
ABC genes. ABC transporter gene was considered to be expressed if its normalized intensity value exceeded 0. The expression levels are
illustrated by seven grade color scales representing relative expression levels of -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 and 3. Red color represent positive; black color
represent zero; green color represent negative; A/MSG anterior/middle silk gland, PSG posterior silk gland.

studies of gene function and regulation.

genes using qRT-PCR. Besides BmABC005226, four
other genes, including BmABC005203, BmABC005202,
BmABC010555, and BmABC010557, are also preferentially expressed in the midgut. Moreover, we investigated their temporal expression patterns in the midgut,
which revealed that the 4 ABCG genes are highly
expressed during the wandering and prepupal stages as
well. The qRT-PCR data (Figure 6B-E) roughly matches
the microarray data (Figure 5), implying that they are
also 20E responsive.
In addition, BmABC002581 (brown) and BmABC012035
were highly expressed in brain, and the mRNA level of
brown peaked during the feeding stage of the fifth instar
(Additional File 12: Fig. S12). Unfortunately, we did not

The expression patterns in Figure 6 imply that the 5 midgut-specific ABCG genes, including BmABC005226,
BmABC005203, BmABC005202, BmABC010555, and
BmABC010557, might be up-regulated by 20E during
molting and pupation. To test this hypothesis, we injected
20E into day 2 of fifth instar larvae and USP dsRNA into
larvae at the initiation of the early wandering stage,
followed by measurements of their mRNA levels using

expressed during molting and pupation, exhibiting possible regulation by 20E. We then analyzed the temporal
expression patterns of the silkworm ABC genes from
day 4 of fifth instar to the adult stage using the microarray data of developmental changes of mRNA [34]. The
analysis revealed that the expression of 19 and 21 ABC
genes can be detected in females and males, respectively
(Figure 5). We found that BmABC005226, an ABCG
gene, was highly expressed during pupation (12 hours
after the wandering stage) and the early pupal stage (60
hours after the wandering stage), when the 20E level is
high. As determined by qRT-PCR, BmABC005226 is
exclusively expressed in the midgut and highly expressed
during the wandering and prepupal stages, when the
20E level is high (Figure 6A). The microarray and qRTPCR data suggest that the midgut-specific ABCG gene,
BmABC005226, is regulated by 20E at the transcriptional level.
We are very interested in the ABCG subfamily, which
is particular in both structure and function [30]. In an
unpublished survey in D. melanogaster, we have found
that several ABCG transporters are exclusively
expressed in two important endocrine organs, the corpus allatum which produces juvenile hormone and the
prothoracic gland which produces ecdysone (the 20E
immediate precursor). To this end, we investigated the
spatial expression patterns of all the 13 silkworm ABCG

Figure 8 Down-regulation of the 5 silkworm ABCG genes, including BmABC005226, BmABC005203, BmABC005202, BmABC010555 and
BmABC010557, in the midgut by USP RNAi. E75 was used as a positive control. Twenty four hours after RNAi treatment, the larvae were
sacrificed for qRT-PCR analysis. Thirty animals were used for each group and 3 biological replicates were conducted.

It has been reported that the TMD of ABCG2 binds
steroids and the binding mediates modulation of ABCG2
activity [36]. However, little is known about whether and
how ABCG genes are transcriptionally regulated by steroid hormones in mammals. Since gene duplication is
very evident in the ABCG subfamily in insects but not in
human, the similarity of ABCG transporters in both physiological function and hormonal regulation is of great
interest. We suppose that transcriptional regulation of
ABCG genes by the steroid hormone 20E in the silkworm
holds promising values for further investigation.

Conclusion
This study provides a genome-wide analysis of the ABC
transporters from the silkworm and a comparative analysis of the ABC family from 5 insect species. A large
number of silkworm ABC genes are highly expressed in
the testis and the Malpighian tubule. Two ABCG genes,
BmABC002712 and BmABC005226, are exclusively
expressed in the Malpighian tubule and the midgut,
respectively. Moreover, 5 ABCG genes are preferentially
expressed in the midgut and their transcriptional levels
are up-regulated by 20E during molting and pupation.
The descriptive study of silkworm ABCG genes lays a
foundation for future analysis of their physiological
function and hormonal regulation, using both the RNAi
approach [13,14] and the binary GAL4/UAS transgenic
system [37-39].

Methods
Animals

Bombyx larvae were provided by the Sericultural
Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural
Sciences. They were reared with fresh mulberry leaves
in the laboratory at 25Â°C under 14 hour light/10 hour
dark cycles [13,14].
Gene identification, sequence alignment, phylogenetic
analysis, and genomic distribution

We mainly used SilkDB [40,41] to search for potential
ABC genes. First, we used the highly conserved NBDs
of all 56 D. melanogaster ABC genes as queries to
search against the updated GLEAN gene collection to
identify silkworm ABC genes by local BLASTP [42],
with an E-value threshold of 10-6. In addition, KAIKObase was also used, particularly for obtaining the fulllength cDNA sequences. The identified putative ABC
transporter genes were validated by search of the protein database of the NCBI with the putative ABC gene
sequences as queries. Each potential ABC transporter
was further analyzed by the program Pfam to identify
its NBD and TMD domains. Finally, the identified silkworm ABC genes were used as queries to search
SilkDB and KAIKObase again in order to avoid missing genes. The same methods were used for identification of ABC transporters in A. gambiae, A. mellifera
and T. castaneum.

Liu et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:491
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/491

Protein sequence alignments were performed using
ClustalX [43]. NBDs were then subjected to a phylogenetic analysis, using neighbor joining and bootstrapping
with 1000 replicates in the program package MEGA4.0
[44].
We used SilkMap tool in silkworm genome database
to map the loci of each ABC genes on the 28 chromosomes. Genes in clusters, for example, BmABC000724
and BmABC000725 on Chromosome 1, are indicated by
a vertical line (Additional File 4: Fig. S4).
Microarray analysis

We used silkworm genome-wide microarray data to profile the expression patterns of ABC genes in multiple larval
tissues and during the larval-pupal-adult metamorphosis.
The expression patterns of ABC transporter genes were
estimated from intensity values [33]. From SilkDB, we
downloaded normalized microarray data (GSE17571) for
genome-wide gene expression in the anterior/middle silk
gland (A/MSG), posterior silk gland (PSG), testis, ovary,
fat body, midgut, integument, hemocyte, Malpighian
tubule, and head on day 3 of the fifth larval instar.
Normalized microarray data for gene expression at 19
time points during silkworm metamorphosis was recently
performed (unpublished data from Southwest University).
The sequential time points include V4 (day 4 of the fifth
larval instar), V5, V6, V7, W0 (0 h after wandering), W12,
W24, W36, W48, W60 (just after pupation), W72, W96,
W120, W144, W168, W192, W216, W240, and adult
(moth). The expression pattern of the ABC genes was estimated from intensity values. An ABC gene was considered
to be expressed if its normalized intensity value exceeded
0 [34].
qRT-PCR

Total RNA was extracted from the whole body or selected
tissues of different developmental stages and used for
qRT-PCR analysis as previously described [13,14]. Primers
used here and somewhere else in this paper are listed in
Additional File 13, Table S1.
Hormone treatments

As described previously [13,14], day 2 of the fifth instar
larvae (48 hrs after the fourth molting) was chosen for 20E
injection (Sigma Aldrich, USA) (5 Î¼g/larva) and the controls were injected with the same volume of control solvent. Six hours after 20E treatment, larvae were sacrificed
to dissect tissues for qRT-PCR analysis. Ten animals were
used for each group and 3 biological replicates were
conducted.
RNAi

dsRNA was generated using the T7 RiboMAXâ¢ Express
RNAi system (Promega, USA). At the initiation of the

Page 12 of 14

early wandering stage, each individual larva was injected
with GFP dsRNA (10 Î¼g) or USP dsRNA (10 Î¼g).
Twenty four hours after RNAi treatment, the larvae
were sacrificed for qRT-PCR analysis [13,14]. Thirty animals were used for each group and 3 biological replicates were conducted.
