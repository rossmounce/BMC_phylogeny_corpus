Developmental control of lateralized neuron size
in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans
Andrew D Goldsmith1, Sumeet Sarin1, Shawn Lockery2, Oliver Hobert1*

Abstract
Background: Nervous systems are generally bilaterally symmetric on a gross structural and organizational level but
are strongly lateralized (left/right asymmetric) on a functional level. It has been previously noted that in vertebrate
nervous systems, symmetrically positioned, bilateral groups of neurons in functionally lateralized brain regions differ
in the size of their soma. The genetic mechanisms that control these left/right asymmetric soma size differences
are unknown. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans offers the opportunity to study this question with single
neuron resolution. A pair of chemosensory neurons (ASEL and ASER), which are bilaterally symmetric on several
levels (projections, synaptic connectivity, gene expression patterns), are functionally lateralized in that they express
distinct chemoreceptors and sense distinct chemosensory cues.
Results: We describe here that ASEL and ASER also differ substantially in size (soma volume, axonal and dendritic
diameter), a feature that is predicted to change the voltage conduction properties of the two sensory neurons.
This difference in size is not dependent on sensory input or neuronal activity but developmentally programmed by
a pathway of gene regulatory factors that also control left/right asymmetric chemoreceptor expression of the two
ASE neurons. This regulatory pathway funnels via the DIE-1 Zn finger transcription factor into the left/right
asymmetric distribution of nucleoli that contain the rRNA regulator Fibrillarin/FIB-1, a RNA methyltransferase
implicated in the non-hereditary immune disease scleroderma, which we find to be essential to establish the size
differences between ASEL and ASER.
Conclusions: Taken together, our findings reveal a remarkable conservation of the linkage of functional
lateralization with size differences across phylogeny and provide the first insights into the developmentally
programmed regulatory mechanisms that control neuron size lateralities.

Background
One of the most fundamental aspects of biological control is the regulation of size, on the level of the individual cell, an organ, and the whole organism. Studies in
yeast have yielded scores of genes controlling size, many
associated with ribosomal protein synthesis [1]. In
metazoan organisms, growth and size control are usually
studied on the level of either whole organs or even
whole organisms, and several genetic mechanisms
involved in organism and organ size control have been
elucidated [1,2]. For example, signaling pathways triggered by insulin and TGFb are known to control

organismal size [1-4]. Moreover, intriguing links
between size control and tumor formation and suppression have been found in the form of genes such as Myc,
Brat, and TFG [1,2,5,6].
In spite of these advances, size regulation in the nervous system is poorly understood, even though the size
differences of neurons are particularly astonishing.
Cross-sectional cell soma size of neurons ranges widely
from 0.005 mm to 0.1 mm in mammals. Size in terms
of length of axon and dendrites can also hugely differ
from neuron type to neuron type, from several microns
to several meters within one given mammalian species.
Two different nematode species, Caenorhabditis elegans
and Ascaris suum have the same number and types of
neurons (their axonal projection patterns are identical as
well), yet they differ in soma size and neuronal processes length by several orders of magnitude [7]. Even

though the astounding range of neuron sizes in the nervous system has been known for a long time, few genes
have been found that specifically control neuronal soma
size. One striking case is the gene encoding the phosphatase PTEN, which, when knocked-out, results in a
significant increase in neuron soma size, an effect
mediated by the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) [8-10]. The importance of the PTEN-mediated
neuron-size regulation is illustrated by Lhermitte-Duclos
disease, which is characterized by overgrowth of neuronal soma [8,9].
Neuron size regulation is particularly enigmatic when
considering size difference between otherwise quite
similar neuronal cell types. Such differential size regulation is strikingly apparent in one intriguing and poorly
understood context in the nervous system, that of neuronal laterality. In general, nervous systems are morphologically bilaterally symmetric, yet they often are
lateralized (left/right asymmetric) in specific functions
[11]. That is, groups of neurons located on one side of
the brain perform different tasks than their mirrorsymmetric neurons on the contralateral side of the
brain. This lateralization is evident in many nervous systems across phylogeny, from worms to humans [11-14].
Yet how such asymmetry is genetically programmed is
poorly understood. Curiously, in spite of the strong
functional lateralization of many brain areas, there are
very few genetic correlates to this asymmetry, that is,
very few genes are known to be expressed in a left/right
asymmetric manner in the adult nervous system of any
species [12-14]. However, there is another quite striking
correlate to functional asymmetry that has been
described in several systems: a difference in soma size of
contralateral neuronal ensembles. For example, within
several subfields of the human hippocampus, there are
regional differences in soma size in the left versus right
hemisphere [15]. Intriguingly, these hemispheric soma
size differences are abrogated in schizophrenic patients
[15]. Left/right asymmetric soma size differences have
also been observed within auditory and languageassociated regions of the temporal lobe [16]. Similarly,
the optic tectum of birds, which is strongly functionally
lateralized, displays soma size differences in contralateral
neuron types [17,18]. It is, however, not clear how widespread the coupling of functional lateralization and size
regulation is. Also, virtually nothing is known about the
underlying molecular pathways that control cell size in
these left/right asymmetric, neuronal contexts.
The nematode C. elegans contains an exquisitely wellcharacterized, largely bilateral nervous system that also
displays functional lateralization [12,13] and therefore
serves as a good model to investigate the problem of
neuronal left/right asymmetry. We investigate here a
pair of chemosensory neurons, the ASE neurons (Figure

Page 3 of 17

1A). These two neurons, a left and a right one (ASEL
and ASER) are symmetrically positioned in one of the
main head ganglia of C. elegans and are bilaterally symmetric in many morphological (dendritic morphology,
synaptic connectivity) and molecular (gene expression)
regards [12,19,20]. However, each neuron senses a distinct spectrum of chemosensory cues and expresses a distinct spectrum of putative chemoreceptors (Figure 1A)
[12,21]. Moreover, one neuron (ASEL) responds to
upshifts in the concentration of a chemosensory cue,
inducing runs in the locomotory behavior of the animal,
while the other neuron (ASER) responds to downshifts,
inducing reversals of the animal [22]. This lateralization
is controlled through a complex bistable system composed of several gene regulatory factors, including regulatory RNAs and transcription factors [23].
Even though its neuronal anatomy has been described
in detail, neuronal size has, somewhat curiously, not
been studied at any great depth in C. elegans. Moreover,
it has not been addressed whether functionally lateralized neuron pairs display soma size differences. If this
were indeed the case, it may be possible to link genetic
mechanisms that control functional lateralization to
lateralized size control. We investigate this issue in this
paper.

Results
The pair of ASE neurons displays size asymmetries

We visualized the ASEL and ASER gustatory neurons in
live animals using chromosomally integrated gfp reporter
gene constructs in which ASE-expressed cis-regulatory
sequences drive non-localized green fluorescent protein
(GFP), which diffuses throughout the entire cell and its
processes (Figure 1A). Using two different transgenes
(otIs242 = che-1 prom::gfp and otIs125 = flp-6 prom::gfp),
we find that the two neuron soma show consistent and
highly stereotyped size differences in adult animals (see
Materials and methods for details on size measurements). The volume of the soma of ASER is more than
30% larger than the soma of ASEL (Figure 1).
We next examined the size of specific structures in
the soma. Using a gfp reporter that is targeted to the
nucleus of ASEL and ASER, we find that the volume
of the nucleus of ASER is not significantly different
from that of the ASEL neuron (Figure 2A). We estimated DNA content (that is, ploidy) of the ASEL versus ASER cell using the standard DAPI stain and
observed no significant difference either (Figure 2B).
We then visualized the number and size of nucleoli.
We find that the ASER neuron contains, on average,
more nucleoli (Figure 2C,D).
Using a set of available electron microscopical sections
of the head regions of two different worms, we found
that these size differences are not restricted to soma

volume, but extend to the relative cross-sectional areas of
these neurons. They show an almost twofold difference
in cross-sectional area, which translates into a two-fold
difference in the volume per unit length (Figure 3A).
These results were confirmed with confocal imaging of
dendritic diameter using gfp reporters (Figure 3B). The
axonal projections of ASEL/R into the nerve ring also
show lateralities in diameter (Figure 3C). The overall
length of the axonal projections and dendrites are the
same on the left and right [19].
We also examined a panel of additional neuron pairs
in the head ganglia. We examined four additional sensory neuron pairs (AWCL/R, ADFL/R, AWBL/R, ASKL/
R) and one interneuron pair (AIYL/R; the main postsynaptic target of ASEL/R). We found that even though
there was some variation in individual animals, none of
these neurons showed, on average, any indication of a
consistent laterality in soma size (Figure 1C,D). This
notion was corroborated by an analysis of sensory dendrite diameter, in which we also found no significant
sidedness (Figure 3A), again in contrast to the situation
with ASEL/R.
We examined the AWCL/R case in more detail. Like
the ASEL/R gustatory neuron pair, this olfactory neuron
pair is known to be functionally lateralized. The left versus right neurons sense different sensory cues and process information differentially [13,24,25]. However, in
contrast to ASEL/R laterality, which is deterministic
(that is, 100% invariant; a phenomenon called ‘directional asymmetry’) [26], AWCL/R asymmetry is stochastic (a phenomenon called ‘antisymmetry’) [26]. This
lateralization can be visualized with two distinct putative
odorant receptors, str-2 and srsx-3 [27]. In 50% of animals str-2 is expressed in the AWCL, while in the other
50% it is expressed in AWCR. srsx-3 shows the complementary pattern. The str-2-expressing cell has traditionally been called the AWCon cell [24]. Even though, on
average, AWC soma showed no laterality, we tested
whether the AWCon or AWCoff cell may correlate with
a specific relative size. However, this is not the case
(Figure 1C,D).
Taken together, the functionally lateralized ASEL/R
neuron pair shows a consistent soma size laterality that
is paralleled by axonal, dendritic, and nucleolar lateralities, but not by lateralities in nuclear size or DNA content. The neuron pairs that we examined for lateralities
included neuron pairs in physical proximity to ASEL/R
and/or related by common ancestry (that is, lineage).
A lack of directional asymmetry in these related neuron
pairs illustrates that it is not simply the case that one
side (’hemisphere’) of the worm is larger than the other,
but rather that neuron size is regulated in a neurontype-specific manner. We also note that absolute size
measurements of other neuron pairs differ from neuron

Page 6 of 17

type to neuron type, with the larger ASER not being larger than other neuron pairs and the smaller ASEL not
being smaller than yet other neuron pairs. It is therefore
not obvious as to whether the size difference between
ASEL and ASER is due to ‘overgrowth’ of ASER or
‘growth inhibition’ of ASEL.
Size differences translate into distinct electrophysiological
properties

One of the most likely functional consequences of a difference in size is a difference in the passive spread of
voltage from one end of a neuron to the other. To
assess whether the observed left-right differences in
neurite diameters are theoretically sufficient to produce
a significant difference in voltage spread, we modeled
ASE neurons as a pair of cylindrical cables representing
the dendrite and axon. The cables were joined at one
end and sealed at the other. The soma was omitted
because it is too small to affect the extent of voltage
spread [28]. Voltage spread is a function of the ratio
R of membrane and axial resistivity as well as the anatomical dimensions. R was set to the value obtained in a
previous analysis of ASER neurons [28]. Here we
assume that the effective passive electrical properties of
ASEL and ASER, including the value of R, are the same
for small depolarizations in the likely operating range of
the neurons. Partial support for this assumption is provided by the fact that the steady state current-voltage
relationships of these neurons are nearly identical in
their operating range. Dendrite and axon lengths were
measured in confocal reconstructions from GFP-labeled
ASE neurons in unfixed animals (dendrite, 116 μm, n =
28; axon, 80 μm, n = 18). The diameter of the dendrites
and axons of ASEL and ASER neurons were measured
separately in each of 13 worms (Figure 3B,C). For each
worm, we used standard cable theory [28,29] to compute the steady-state voltage at the beginning or end of
the axon in response to a unit depolarization of the distal tip of the dendrite (representing the sensory cilium
where sensory transduction is believed to occur in real
ASE neurons). We found small but significant differences in the extent of voltage spread at both locations
(Figure 4). As output synapses from ASEL and ASER
neurons reside along the entire length of their axons, we
conclude that differences in process diameters could
result in stronger outputs from ASER neurons.
Size laterality does not depend on sensory activity, but is
embryonically programmed by the che-1 transcription
factor

The soma size lateralities in the optic tectum of birds
correlate with loci of functional lateralities, and those
functional lateralities are dependent on visual input, that
is, neuronal activity [11,17,18]. We therefore tested

whether activity of the ASE neurons has an impact on
their size differences. We examined soma size lateralities
in a number of mutants in which the ASE neurons are
not able to sense or transduce sensory stimuli. We
observed no effect on soma size laterality (Figure 5A).
Keeping animals in a sensory-deprived environment by

hatching them in water also does not affect soma size
lateralities (Figure 5A). These findings suggest that
rather than being activity-dependent, size lateralities
may be developmentally programmed. To test this
notion, we examined ASEL/R size laterality not just in
the adult, but also at earlier stages. We indeed find that

already at the first larval stage, right after hatching, the
differences in size between the two neurons is already as
apparent as in the adult (Figure 5B). Going back to the
450-minute stage of embryogenesis-100 minutes after
the ASE neurons are formed-we already observe size differences. The observation of differential size regulation
occurring in the C. elegans embryo is somewhat unexpected as, in contrast to the enormous size increase of
all cell types after hatching, there is in general little
overall cell growth in embryos. Rather, as the overall
volume of the embryo is constant, every cell division
results in smaller daughter cell sizes.
To begin analyzing the genetic mechanisms that
underlie these size differences, we first used a genetic
background in which the ASEL/R neurons fail to be
appropriately specified. The ASEL/R-specific che-1 Zn
finger transcription factor is required for the correct
development of ASEL/R neurons; in che-1 mutants,
ASEL/R neurons are not functional (that is, animals are
not able to chemotax to water-soluble attractants, hence
the name che), and fail to express scores of genes that
are normally expressed in ASE, yet the ASE neurons are
still generated [20,30,31]. Measuring the size of ASE
neurons in che-1 mutants, we find that the soma differences of ASEL and ASER are eliminated (Figure 5C).
Left/right size differences are therefore programmed
through the activity of the che-1 transcription factor.
Gene regulatory factors that control functional laterality
also control size asymmetry

We next turned to a set of genes that we have previously identified as controlling the functional left/
right asymmetry of the ASE neurons [23]. A complex
regulatory system, composed of transcription factors
and regulatory RNAs, controls the left/right asymmetric expression of distinct putative chemoreceptors of
the gcy gene family in ASEL versus ASER (Figure 6A).
The activity of what we termed ‘class I’ regulatory genes
promotes ASER fate, and their loss leads to a conversion
of ASER to ASEL. ‘Class II’ regulatory genes have the
opposite activity; they promote ASEL fate and their loss
leads to a conversion of ASEL to ASER. Class I
and class II genes cross-inhibit each other’s activities
(Figure 6A).
We first analyzed ASE soma size lateralities in three
different genetic contexts in which both neurons are
transformed to the ASER fate (’2 ASER’; as assessed by
gcy chemoreceptor gene expression). We used animals
carrying loss-of-function mutations in the ASEL inducers die-1 (a Zn finger transcription factor) and lsy-6
(a miRNA), and transgenic animals in which the ASERinducer cog-1 (a homeobox gene) is ectopically
expressed in both ASE neurons. We find that in all
three genetic backgrounds, both ASE neurons now

Page 10 of 17

adopt the larger size that is normally characteristic of
ASER (Figure 6B). Similarly, we analyzed ASE soma size
lateralities in two different genetic contexts in which
both neurons are transformed to the ASEL fate
(‘2 ASEL’; as assessed by gcy chemoreceptor gene
expression), namely in animals carrying loss of function
mutation in the ASER inducers cog-1 and in transgenic
animals that ectopically express the ASEL-inducer lsy-6
bilaterally in both ASE neurons. In both genetic backgrounds, both ASE neurons now adopt the smaller size
that is normally characteristic of ASEL (Figure 6B). The
effect of die-1 manifests itself not only on the soma size
difference of ASEL/R, but also on difference in the number of nucleoli; they become bilaterally symmetric in the
die-1 mutant (Figure 6C).
ASEL and ASER inducers act in a feedback loop [32].
We sought to determine which genes provide the output
from this loop to size control. For the determination of
left/right asymmetric chemoreceptor expression, die-1 is
the output, as the effect of die-1 on all previously
known lateralities is epistatic to any genetic manipulations in the loop [32]. We performed similar epistasis
experiment, scoring asymmetric soma size. We find that
die-1 is epistatic to both manipulations of cog-1 and lsy6 activity (Figure 6B). That is, the ‘2 ASEL size’ phenotype of either cog-1(-) or lsy-6 misexpression is reverted
to the ‘2 ASER size’ phenotype in a die-1(-) background.
The two transcription factors lim-6 (a LIM homeobox
gene) and fozi-1 (a Zn finger transcription factor) act
downstream of die-1 as effector genes, regulating a subset
of left/right asymmetric features of ASEL and ASER
(Figure 6A) [32,33]. We find that these regulators
have no impact on the ASEL/R soma size differential
(Figure 6B).
Taken together, these findings show that size control
is tightly controlled by a genetic regulatory mechanism
that defines other aspects of laterality of the ASEL and
ASER neurons as well. The control of left/right asymmetric size and chemoreceptor expression does, however, branch out downstream of die-1 (Figure 6A), as
lim-6 and fozi-1 affect chemoreceptor expression but
not size. We hypothesize that die-1 regulates either
directly or indirectly the expression of effector genes
that control size.
A candidate gene approach identifies the nucleolar
protein FIB-1 as a size regulator

The impact of the DIE-1 and CHE-1 transcription factors
on lateralization of soma size is presumably mediated by
gene(s) that are under control of these factors and possibly expressed in a left/right asymmetric manner. In an
attempt to identify these effector genes, we tested a large
number of candidate genes for an effect on ASEL/R soma
size differences. These candidates encode proteins that

have, in various different systems, been implicated in
controlling cell size. The candidate genes that we testeda total of 24 loci (some tested both with gain-and loss-offunction alleles)-are listed in Table 1 and results are
shown Figure 7. Among the tested strains are animals
mutant components of the insulin receptor-like signaling
system, the C. elegans Myc homolog mml-1 [34], regulators of ribosomal RNA synthesis like Brat/ncl-1 [1], sma
and lon genes [4], the C. elegans homolog of the nucleolar protein Fibrillarin, FIB-1, and a recently discovered
set of genes involved in body size control in worms
(CREB-like gene crh-1, nucleostemin/nst-1, translational
initiation factor eIF2B/iftb-1, tumor suppressor gene
TFG/tfg-1) [6]. We also tested the impact of a calciumdependent pathway that in other systems is involved in
cell swelling in response to external/environmental challenges (’regulatory volume decrease’) [35].
We found that reduction or elimination of only some
of the candidate size regulators affect overall ASEL and
ASER size (Figure 7A,B). These include the phosphatase
PTEN, the kinase AKT, the Brat tumor suppressor Brat/

Ncl-1 and the small GTPase Rheb-1, but surprisingly, not
canonical size regulators, such as the insulin/IGF-1
receptor (Figure 7A,B). Of all the mutant animals tested,
only one eliminated the difference in soma size between
ASEL and ASER (Figure 7B). These animals carry a deletion allele, ok2527 (kindly provided by the Oklahoma
C. elegans knockout consortium; Figure 7C) that eliminates the nucleolar protein Fibrillarin/FIB-1, an RNA
methyltransferase involved in ribosome biogenesis [36].
This finding is in accordance with the observation that
ASER contains more FIB-1 positive nucleoli than ASEL
(Figure 2). Linking FIB-1 accumulation to the upstream
gene regulatory factors, we find that in die-1 mutants, the
number of FIB-1(+) nucleoli increases in ASEL (Figure 6C).
Even though fib-1 is required for the manifestation of
the size differences, it is not sufficient, as we did not
observe any effect on the size differential in transgenic animals that overexpress fib-1 bilaterally in both ASEL and
ASER using the ceh-36 promoter (four transgenic lines
tested; data not shown). We also note that loss of fib-1 has
no effect on left/right asymmetric chemoreceptor

expression (gcy-5 and gcy-7; data not shown), corroborating the notion that size control can be decoupled from
other aspects of ASEL/R laterality. In conclusion, our candidate gene analysis has uncovered a protein with a function in nucleolar biogenesis required for left/right
differential size laterality in the nervous system.

Discussion
We describe here a developmentally programmed size
laterality of a functionally lateralized neuron pair. It is
striking that the theme of lateralized soma sizes in functionally lateralized brain regions is conserved from
higher vertebrates-for example, the optic tectum in
chick [17,18]-to a simple invertebrate like C. elegans.
The theoretical differences in passive voltage spread
presented here (Figure 4) could have significant functional consequences. Other things being equal, one
would expect stronger synaptic outputs from ASER in
response to the same level of depolarization in the cilia
of two neurons. Notably, it can be shown from first
principles that for chemotaxis in a radial gradient, “off
cells” like ASER (i.e. neurons responding to a decrease
of a signal) are sufficient, whereas “on cells” like ASEL
(i.e. neurons responding to an increase of a signal) are
not [37]. Thus, worms with stronger ASER outputs
would enjoy a selective advantage, which may have
resulted in an increase in ASER size. If validated experimentally, differential voltage spread would join a growing list of several distinct properties of the ASEL versus
ASER neurons, including differential sensation of taste
cues, differential chemoreceptor expression, differential
response to upsteps (ASEL) versus downsteps (ASER) of
chemosensory cues and differential contributions to spatial orientation behaviors [36,38]. These features are
layered upon otherwise largely symmetric characteristics
of ASE [20]. However, in contrast to the invariant left/
right asymmetric expression of chemoreceptors, we note
that the ASER > ASEL size differences are only observed
when averaged over a population. That is, there are
individuals in which either no differences in size are
observed or in which the size asymmetry is reversed.
Whether this is due to experimental error or is an indication of distinct chemosensory capacities of individual
animals within a population remains to be determined.
We provide here three mechanistic insights into how
differential size regulation is achieved. First, we find that
size asymmetries are not activity-dependent, but developmentally controlled. Second, we have identified a
transcriptional regulator, the Zn finger transcription factor DIE-1 (as well as its upstream regulators), which
controls size laterality. The involvement of die-1 in controlling size parallels its involvement in controlling lateralized chemoreceptor expression. However, transcription
factors acting downstream of die-1, namely the lim-6

Page 14 of 17

LIM homeobox gene and the fozi-1 Zn finger factor,
which also affect chemoreceptor expression, do not
affect differential size regulation. Regulatory pathways
controlling size and chemoreceptor expression therefore
branch downstream of die-1 (summarized in Figure 8).
Third, we have identified the functionally as yet uncharacterized C. elegans fibrillarin gene fib-1 as a gene
required for ASEL/R size laterality. fib-1 encodes a phylogenetically conserved RNA methyltransferase involved
in ribosome biogenesis whose human homolog is a
nucleolar autoantigen for the non-hereditary immune
disease scleroderma [39]. Our demonstration that loss of
fib-1 results in alterations on cell size may not be unexpected, given that yeast fibrillarin has been found to
control pre-rRNA processing, pre-rRNA methylation and
ribosome assembly [40] and that nucleolar size and ribosomal biogenesis have been previously linked to cell size
control [1], but our results nevertheless provide the first
direct implication of fibrillarin in cell size control and
they also place fibrillarin activity and nucleolar size into a
previously unknown cellular and functional context.
fib-1 acts downstream, and is therefore a target of the
die-1 Zn finger transcription factor, a conclusion based
on our observation that the number of FIB-1(+) nucleoli
increases - together with overall size - if normal die-1
expression in ASEL is lost. At this point, we can not tell
whether the fib-1 locus is a direct transcriptional target
of DIE-1 or whether differential FIB-1 accumulation in
ASEL versus ASER is an indirect consequence of DIE-1
function in ASEL (or absence thereof in ASER). fib-1 is
unlikely to be the sole (direct or indirect) target of DIE-1
in the context of size control since fib-1, unlike die-1, is
not sufficient to impose ASER size. Work in yeast and
flies has amply demonstrated that the genes encoding
nucleolar proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, such
as fibrillarin, are co-regulated through common transcriptional control mechanisms (’Ribi regulon’) [41-44].
Several distinct types of transcription factors are involved
in controlling the Ribi regulon, such as the yeast Forkhead like protein Fhl1 or, in metazoans, the Myc transcription factor [42-44]. DIE-1 may either be directly
involved in such a co-regulatory mechanism or may be
involved in indirectly triggering such a mechanism via
intermediary regulators (Figure 8). DIE-1 therefore joins
the ever-growing list of transcriptional regulators of cell
size; however, the role of DIE-1 in size regulation may be
highly context dependent, as die-1 mutants do not display any gross defects in animal size.
Our analysis of candidate size regulators has also identified a series of genes that control overall neuron size
in a bilaterally symmetric manner (that is, both ASEL
and ASER are affected). Given the paucity of known size
regulators in the nervous system, some of our partially
unexpected results raise questions and provide a starting

Figure 8 Model for size regulation in ASEL/R. die-1 gene activity controls left/right asymmetric functional features, such as asymmetric
expression of the putative gcy chemoreceptors, and is required for the asymmetric size of ASEL versus ASER as well as the asymmetric number
of FIB-1(+) nucleoli in ASEL versus ASER. The effect of die-1 on size cannot solely be explained through regulation of fib-1, as fib-1 is required but
not sufficient to impose ASER size. die-1 may therefore regulate the expression of other genes involved in size control. die-1 may regulate fib-1
expression directly or indirectly (as indicated with the question mark).

point for future analysis. As expected from work in other
systems [8-10], daf-18/PTEN mutants show increased
neuron size. However, a null mutation in the insulin/
IGF-like receptor in worms, daf-2, does not affect neuron
size, even though the same signaling system does have
profound effects on size and growth in other organisms
[45]. Yet, loss of another gene in the daf-2 pathway, the
Ser/Thr kinase akt-1 does significantly affect the size of
both ASEL and ASER, suggesting that AKT may be
coupled to a distinct upstream input. However, unlike in
other systems, in which AKT negatively regulates size
[46], ASEL and ASER size is increased in akt-1 mutants.
A similar, unexpected ‘sign reversal’ is observed in animals lacking the size regulators rheb-1, a small GTPase,
or the nucleolar protein nucleostemin/nst-1, both known
to be required to promote growth in other systems
[47,48], but apparently inhibiting growth of both ASE
neurons. Other known size regulators, such as cdk-4 [49],
do not effect ASEL/R neuron size at all. We also found
no effect of removing the canonical size regulator let363/TOR; however, these animals could only be scored
at the first larval stage due to later larval lethality. The
maternal load of TOR may have rescued any potential
size regulatory effect. The same caveat holds for interpretation of the lack of effect of removing let-60/Ras and tfg1/TFG. Lastly, we note that a transforming growth factor-b signaling pathway previously reported to control
overall animal size in C. elegans [4] does not affect ASE
neuron size, demonstrating that overall animal size is
decoupled from neuron size.

In conclusion, we have provided some of the first
mechanistic insights into how lateralized neuron size is
controlled and we have set a theoretic framework for the
type of impact such size difference may have on neuron
function. It is conceivable that lateralized neuron size differences in vertebrates may also be controlled via nucleolar mechanisms [50], a notion that is not a matter of
course since known cell size control pathways do not
necessarily work through regulation of ribosomal and
hence nucleolar mechanisms [43]. Our findings also raise
the possibility that lateralized neuron size control may be
uncoupled from more canonical mechanisms of size control in other cell and tissue types. This is because we find
that asymmetric neuron size control is established at a
stage (embryo) when no other tissues undergo the generic growth that is characteristic of late embryonic and
larval growth and because asymmetric neuron size control does not involve many of the canonical body size
regulators. The identification of direct target genes of the
die-1 transcription factor, the regulator we found to
impinge on the ASEL/R size differential, will provide
more insights into this pathway in the future.

otIs173 = ttx-3prom::gfp. ASE nuclear size was measured
with otIs188 (che-1fosmid::yfp).
Measurements of ASE features

For the soma or nuclear size measurement, transgenic
worms, harboring neuron-type specifically expressed
reporter constructs are picked at the desired stage
(either L1 or adult) and examined using an Axioplan
2 microscope and a Sensicam QE camera controlled
by Micro-Manager software [51]. Worms were rolled
on the cover slip such that ASEL and ASER were in
the same plane (dorso-ventral view), and stacks were
made with a 63 × oil-immersion objective at 1 μm
depth. The stacks were analyzed using ImageJ software, where the contrast of the cell was chosen such
that the fluorescence intensity did not impinge on
neighboring cells, and the ImageJ plugin Voxel Counter was used to count the number of pixels for each
cell. GFP intensity was normalized by cropping stacks
around each cell separately and adjusting the brightness levels of the two stacks such that the maximum
intensity level of each stack was reset to one standard.
Statistical analysis of the relative sizes within a given
strain was also performed by using a paired two-tailed
t-test; significance was determined using the Bonferroni correction. For sets of experiments where n ≥ 3,
we employed the Bonferroni correction: instead of
using thresholds of P < 0.05 or P < 0.01, we used stricter P-value thresholds of P < 1-((1-0.05) 1/n ) and P < 1((1-0.01) 1/n ), respectively, where n is the number of
experiments in a given set. We measured cross-sectional diameters in the electron micrographs by tracing
each dendrite in ImageJ and using the Measure tool.
We measured ploidy by ethanol fixation followed by
DAPI staining either otIs151 (ceh-36 prom ::rfp) or
otIs232 (che-1::mChopti) for ASE cell identification.
Image stacks of DAPI-stained worms were taken using
the method described above. We measured DAPI
intensity as a proxy for DNA amount and report the
data as relative DAPI intensities. We used freeze fracture followed by methanol/acetone fixation for
immunostaining.
To determine nucleoli size and number, we used
cguIs001 (fib-1::gfp) [52] and an antibody against
Nop1p (FIB-1) from EnCor BioTechnology (#MCA38F3, Gainesville, FL, USA) at a 1:200 dilution,
detected with a 1:200 dilution of an anti-mouse (Invitrogen #A-21202, Carlsbad, CA, USA”) secondary
antibody.
