Abstract
Background: Molecular lock-and-key systems are common among reproductive proteins, yet
their evolution remains a major puzzle in evolutionary biology. In the Brassicaceae, the genes
encoding self-incompatibility have been identified, but technical challenges currently prevent
detailed analyses of the molecular interaction between the male and female components. In the
present study, we investigate sequence polymorphism in the female specificity determinant SRK of
Arabidopsis halleri from throughout Europe. Using a comparative approach based on published SRK
sequences in A. lyrata and Brassica, we track the signature of frequency-dependent selection acting
on these genes at the codon level. Using simulations, we evaluate power and accuracy of our
approach and estimate the proportion of codon sites involved in the molecular interaction.

Background
Molecular lock-and-key systems are common among
reproductive proteins and receptor-hormone complexes
[1]. Because the lock and the key must match in such systems, any evolutionary novelty at one component must be
accompanied by a matching novelty at the other. This
coevolution constraint has made the generation of new
combinations a major -and as yet unsolved- puzzle in evolutionary biology [2-4]. Understanding molecular details
of the interaction can give important insight into the evolutionary dynamics of these systems [5]. In particular, the
proportion of sites involved in recognition and potentially able to alter the interaction is crucial.
Self-incompatibility (SI) systems are fascinating molecular lock-and-key mechanisms preventing selfing in species
from over half of all angiosperm families [6]. In the Brassi-

caceae, the lock and the key are encoded by SRK and SCR
respectively, two highly polymorphic and closely linked
genes. SCR encodes a small protein expressed in anthers
and deposited in the pollen exine layer, while SRK
encodes a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase with
allele-specific affinity for SCR proteins.
SRK is an integral component of the plasma membrane of
the stigma epidermis and is displayed with its glycosylated
N-terminal S-domain external to the cell. When activated
by binding to its cognate SCR protein [7,8], it prevents
selfing by triggering a downstream regulatory pathway
that ultimately inhibits pollen tube germination.
Although the recognition between SCR and SRK has been
demonstrated at the molecular level, the regions of these
molecules important for specificity recognition have

remained elusive. In SCR, a domain swapping experiment
in Brassica between allele SCR6 and allele SCR13 resulted
in a switch from SCR6 to SCR13 specificity, but failed to
switch specificity when the reverse swapping (SCR13
domains to a SCR6 backbone) was performed [9]. These
results suggest the intriguing possibility that functionally
important sites may not be the same in the two alleles
investigated.
Clearly, the analysis of more alleles will now be required
to confirm the role of these domains (see also [10-12]). A
second experimental approach in SCR relied on the functional comparison between pairs of closely related alleles
in Brassica rapa and B. oleracea. [13] demonstrated that
pollen specificity was partly and completely altered
between SCR copies differing by four and eight aminoacid differences respectively, thus providing strong candidates for functionally important codons. In SRK, technical
challenges associated with crystallizing trans-membrane
proteins have hampered the resolution of the threedimensional structure of the protein, such that sites
involved in binding SCR (and thus determining specificity) are currently unknown. Hence, specificity-determining nucleotides along the SRK sequence have mainly been
inferred from the observation that stretches of nucleotides
have unusually elevated replacement site polymorphism
as compared to the rest of the S-domain. Such hyper-variable (HV) regions have been observed in Brassica [14-16],
Raphanus sativus [17] and Arabidopsis lyrata [18]. [19] and
[20] demonstrated that these regions are particularly conserved among functionally equivalent allelic copies of
BoSRK02 and BoSRK13 in B. oleracea, and [21] further
showed that pairs of closely related alleles in B. rapa and
B. oleraceae with identical recognition specificity typically
exhibit very few differences in HV regions. More recently,
[22] provided further support for a functional role of
these regions by reporting that alleles in A. halleri, A. lyrata
and A. thaliana that were probably inherited from a common ancestor have fewer amino acid differences in these
regions than in the rest of the gene.
A limit to this "direct comparison" approach to pinpoint
functionally important sites is that it typically relies on a
low number of naturally occurring variants and does not
integrate over evolutionary times. An alternative approach
is based on the assumption that sites involved in the interaction evolve under specific selective pressures. In particular, while purifying selection at a codon site is expected
to decrease the rate of non-synonymous to synonymous
evolution (dN/dS ratio, hereafter ω), positive and balancing selections are expected to increase this ratio. Tracking
the signature of natural selection at the codon level can
thus reveal functionally important sites along a sequence
(see e.g. [23]). As initially demonstrated by Wright [24],
loci governing SI are expected to experience negative fre-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/132

quency-dependent selection, a form of strong balancing
selection whereby low frequency SCR-SRK combinations
enjoy a selective advantage over alleles present at higher
frequency because they encounter their cognate allele
only rarely. Consequently, substitutions affecting allelic
specificity are expected to enter a population more often
than substitutions not affecting specificity, leading to a
higher rate of non-synonymous than synonymous substitution at codons functionally determining specificity. In
line with this expectation, [16] found higher dN/dS in
Brassica HV regions than in the rest of the protein (1.37
within vs. 0.41 outside HV regions), thus providing further support for their role in specificity.
Similarly, [25] showed that HV regions in Brassica are
enriched in sites with elevated dN/dS ratios as compared to
the rest of the protein.
A recent paper estimated in Brassica that 27 of the c.a. 423
codon sites (= 6.38%) of the S-domain of SRK (precise
length varies) are likely to evolve under recurrent positive
selection events [26]. However, the very long expected
time to coalescence of alleles at SRK translates into very
high levels of diversity, which can saturate the signal of
divergence. This may bring uncertainty into the phylogeny
of SRK alleles, causing potential bias and lowering the
power of the detection method. As shown by [27], the
power of the analysis indeed decreases with sequence
divergence. The possibility thus exists that these codons
represent a very small proportion of sites involved in specificity. Moreover, SRK diversity in Brassica is unusual
among the Brassicaceae in that alleles at this locus cluster
into two very distinct and highly divergent allelic classes.
Brassica thus only shows a subset of the total molecular
diversity found at this gene in the related A. lyrata [18],
and we recently reported at least two deeply divergent SRK
alleles in the closely related A. halleri [22]. There has currently been no evaluation of how the particular allelic
topology in Brassica may affect the power and accuracy of
the method. As reported in [27], increasing the number of
lineages (e.g. by including widely divergent lineages from
Arabidopsis species) is one of the most efficient ways to
increase the statistical power of the method.
In the present paper, we aim at estimating the number of
codons determining allelic specificity at the pistil gene
involved in self-incompatibility in the Brassicaceae, and at
testing whether these codons cluster specifically within
the well-known hypervariable regions of the S-domain,
through an analysis of a large data set of sequences
belonging to three taxa. We report nucleotide sequences
for 22 new SRK alleles in A. halleri, including about half of
the S-domain for all alleles and the kinase domain for six
alleles. We provide evidence for some of these sequences
that they do indeed belong to SRK and compare sequence

polymorphism between A. halleri, A. lyrata and Brassica.
We use a maximum likelihood method to identify codons
along the gene that evolved under positive selection and
compare the number, location and rate of evolution of
such sites in the three taxa. Through simulations we demonstrate that the analysis is highly accurate, and estimate
that the power approaches 60%. Since 25 codons exhibit
signs of positive selection in at least one species, we estimate that almost a quarter of the sites in the sequence
(23%) could be involved in recognition. Our analysis also
provides additional support for a functional role of hypervariable regions along the gene, and suggests that the high
diversity observed in the kinase domain is due to tight
linkage to the S-domain rather than to direct exposure to
positive selection.

Results
Sequences obtained
According to phylogenetic clustering with published
sequences in A. lyrata, the sequences obtained corresponded to twenty new putative A. halleri S-alleles and to
six separate loci belonging to the Brassicaceae S gene family, namely Aly7, Aly8, Aly9, Aly10.1, Aly13-2 and Aly13-7
(Fig. 1A and Table 1; [28]). Linkage to a kinase domain
was demonstrated for alleles AhSRK03, 04, 06, 07, 10 and
18 (Table 2). For 12 of the 22 putative S-alleles in A.
halleri, we found a matching sequence with high similarity
at the S-locus in A. lyrata (Table 2). Sequences from this
study have GenBank accession numbers EU075124–
EU075143, see additional file 1.
Co-segregation of four putative SRK alleles and linkage to
incompatibility phenotype
Offspring from a controlled interspecific cross between an
A. lyrata plant with genotype AlSRK14/AlSRK21 and an A.
halleri pollen donor with genotype AhSRK15/AhSRK21
demonstrated strict co-segregation of the two pairs of
putative SRK alleles, although with segregation ratios substantially different from the expected 1:1 ratio: AlSRK14/
AlSRK21 with a ratio 39:14 and AhSRK15/AhSRK21 with a
ratio 43:17. Segregation bias among S-alleles has already
been reported in [29].

Incompatibility reactions were tested for ten progeny
plants from the interspecific cross, including 2 or more of
each of the four SRK genotypes. 108 pollinations involved
plants whose putative genotypes predict compatibility
(no shared SRK sequences), and for these fruit set was
90.7%. 104 pollinations involved plants whose putative
genotypes predict cross-incompatibility, and the mean
fruit set was 3.8%. These results provided direct evidence
that AhSRK15 and AhSRK21 are functional SRK alleles in
A. halleri, and confirmed that AlSRK14 and AlSRK21 are
functional SRK alleles in A. lyrata.

Sequence polymorphism
The region sequenced spans three of the four different
hypervariable regions (HV2, HV3 and CVR) defined in
Brassica [30]. Aligned protein sequences were variable in
length, differing by as much as 6 amino acid residues (180
residues for AhSRK12 and 186 for AhSRK03, 07, 09, 16
and 19). There was no stop codon in any of the sequences.
Only 29 of the 186 amino acid sites were conserved over
all sequences, 28 being identical in state with the Brassica
sequence BoSRK60. Twelve of these conserved residues
were cystein residues at identical locations as those
described in Brassica by [30]. The 22 sequences contained
on average 3.36 predicted N-linked glycosylation sites per
sequence. Of these, two sites (N246 and N391) were
highly conserved, being shared by all 22 sequences with a
single exception for the latter (absent in AhSRK14). A
third site (N316) was partially conserved, being shared by
6 sequences. The sliding window analysis revealed that
the three hypervariable regions defined in Brassica also
showed elevated diversity in A. halleri and A. lyrata (Fig.
2). However, since the baseline nucleotide diversity outside hypervariable regions was also strikingly higher in A.
halleri and A. lyrata than in Brassica, the peaks of diversity
in hypervariable regions tended to be less pronounced.

Diversity also varied along the different exons of the gene.
Non-synonymous diversity was higher in the S-domain
(in A. halleri, πN = 0.310 in exon 1; Table 3) than in the rest
of the gene, and tended to decrease with increasing physical distance from the S-domain, reaching as low a value
as πN = 0.054 in exon 6. In contrast, although synonymous diversity was higher in the S-domain (πS = 0.819,
Table 3) than in the kinase domain (average πS = 0.529),
diversity remained high throughout the kinase domain
(e.g. πS = 0.732 in exon 5), such that no decrease was
apparent with increasing physical distance from the Sdomain. We found no evidence in any of the three species
for a significant correlation between linkage disequilibrium (LD) and distance between variable sites (p > 0.05),
indicating no strong effect of recombination between SRK
haplotypes.
Sites under positive selection
In all three taxa, model M8 provided a significantly better
fit to the data than either model M7 or model M8a (p <
0.00001 for all taxa for both comparisons), thus revealing
the presence of positively selected codons along the Sdomain of SRK. In A. halleri, after excluding sites with a
gap in any of the sequences, the sequences spanned over
168 codons, including 33 codons from HV2, 11 from HV3
and 5 from CVR. Overall, 12 codons showed evidence for
positive selection in A. halleri (>0.95 posterior BEB probability of belonging to the ω > 1 category; Fig. 3). Of these,
8 were within HV2 (273S, 274D, 276Y, 286S, 287I, 294S,
299I, 306V), none in HV3 and one in CVR (415E), the

remaining 3 codons (353S, 359R, 388S) being outside HV
regions. Given the relative proportion of HV regions along
the sequences, this represents a highly significant clustering of sites within HV regions and CVR (p = 0.0009;
hypergeometric distribution). In A. lyrata, 177 codon sites
contained no gap in any of the sequences, and 13 sites had
a high (>0.95) probability of belonging to the ω > 1 category (Fig. 3). Again, there was a significant clustering of
these sites into HV regions and CVR (p = 0.0198). In
Brassica, we reanalysed the data in [26] but restricted the
dataset to the codon positions sequenced in A. halleri and
excluded two A. lyrata sequences used in this study. After
alignment, 195 codon sites contained no gap in any of the
sequences, and 12 sites had a high (>0.95) probability of
belonging to the ω > 1 category (Fig. 3). All of these sites
except 413E were included in the [26] results, and only
three of the 14 sites identified by [26] remained undetected by the present analysis (291L, 303V, 306V). Thus,

although based on a more restricted stretch of sequence in
the S-domain (195 vs. 423 codons), our results were very
consistent with those of [26]. Interestingly, one of the discrepant sites (306V) was identified in A. halleri and A. lyrata, suggesting that part of the differences observed may
have been due to the inclusion of the two divergent A. lyrata sequences in the [26] analysis. Again, there was in
Brassica a significant clustering of these sites into HV
regions and CVR (p = 0.0002). Strikingly, however, a large
proportion of these sites in Brassica (5/12) were within
HV3, while HV3 contained a single positively selected site
in A. lyrata and none in A. halleri. Overall, 25 positively
selected sites were detected in at least one of the three taxa
(238L, 259R, 273S, 274D, 276Y, 286S, 287I, 288L, 294S,
299I, 305K, 306V, 320L, 330W, 332M, 339E, 340A, 341A,
353S, 359R, 388S, 405T, 413E, 415E and 422D; see Fig.
3). The "fixed sites" model implemented in HYPHY further confirmed that selection was stronger in HV regions
and CVR than in the rest of the protein (higher ω), since
allowing ω to vary between HV regions and the rest of the
protein significantly improved the likelihood of the
model (p < 0.001 in all three species). This difference was
not due to synonymous rate variation, since allowing dS
alone to vary between HV regions and the rest of the protein did not significantly improve the likelihood of the
model (LRT with one d.f., p = 0.416, p = 0.597 and p =
0.103 for Brassica, A. halleri and A. lyrata, respectively).
Analysis of the subset of longer sequences in A. halleri
including both the S- and the kinase domains using
model M8 revealed that eight of the 323 codons analyzed
(273S, 274D, 276Y, 287I, 299I, 345I, 415E, 421Y)
belonged to the maximum likelihood "positively
selected" category. Consistent with [26], all of these
codons were from the S-domain, and none of them were
from the kinase domain. Since only six kinase domain
sequences were available in A. halleri, the analysis had low
power and none of these sites had a posterior BEB probability of belonging to the ω > 1 category above 0.95.
These results were robust to both model specifications
(number of categories allowed for non-positively selected
sites) and uncertainties in phylogenetic reconstruction.
One, 7, and 8 sites were retrieved by M8 (10 categories for
non-positively selected sites) but were not retrieved by
M2a (a single category) in Brassica, A. halleri and A. lyrata,
respectively, while sites retrieved by M2a were in all three
taxa subsets of those retrieved by M8. Thus, in all three
taxa, both models returned very similar sets of sites, except
that M2a returned a lower number of sites, presumably
due to lower power. Results were also robust to uncertainties in the phylogenetic reconstruction. The 95% credible
set of trees was of different size in the three taxa, with 5,
93 and 903 trees in A. halleri, Brassica and A. lyrata, respectively. In A. halleri, the maximum likelihood "positively

topologies, with only minor differences apparent in the
posterior BEB probabilities (one topology identified 13
sites and two identified 14 sites versus 12 sites in the MLtree). In Brassica, the analysis of ten trees randomly chosen from the 93 credible set consistently recovered 11 of
the twelve sites identified by the BEB procedure using the
ML-tree. The higher uncertainty in the phylogenetic reconstruction in A. lyrata (903 trees in the 95% credible set of
trees) apparently led to a higher level of uncertainty in the

identification of sites, since only eight of the 13 sites were
consistently identified using ten randomly chosen trees
from the credible set.
As shown on Fig. 3, a single site (274D) was consistently
identified as evolving under positive selection in all three
species, while most sites were only identified in a single
species or in two different species. Of the 12 sites identified in A. halleri, only 2 (16.7%) were also identified in
Brassica. Similarly, of the 13 sites identified in A. lyrata,

only 3 (23.1%) were also identified in Brassica. Although
the concordance between A. halleri and A. lyrata was
higher (64.1%), this may still be considered very low
given the close phylogenetic proximity of these two species. Interestingly, posterior ω estimates for these sites also
differed greatly among taxa. Codon sites in Brassica with
a high (>0.95) probability of belonging to the ω > 1 category had a BEB posterior ω of 2.985 (average across the 12
sites). In sharp contrast, the BEB posterior ωs were 1.444
and 1.486 in A. halleri and A. lyrata, respectively, i.e. about
two times smaller (2.038 times smaller on average).
Simulations
Simulations in EVOLVER revealed that this low level of
concordance was indeed expected given the method's low
power and the large divergence among SRK sequences. All
sequences from the three species (65 sequences in total)
were used to obtain the phylogeny shown on Fig. 1B. The
maximum likelihood analysis with CODEML identified
that 11.8% of the 161 sites (i.e. 19 codons) were evolving
under ω = 1.754 >1. These values, along with the estimated codon equilibrium frequency, ω distribution (p =
0.530, q = 0.758 for the β distribution), tree length (23.47
substitutions per codon site) and transition/transversion
ratio (κ = 1.9375), were used to simulate 100 replicates of
the evolution of 65 sequences. These simulations first
confirmed that the method was highly accurate at this
high level of divergence. Analysing simulations run with
no site in the ω > 1 category (model M7), we found that
accuracy was indeed consistently high (0.97, 0.93 and
0.95 in Brassica, A. halleri and A. lyrata, respectively), suggesting that sites classified with high probability (>0.95)
into the ω > 1 category were unlikely to be false positives.
However, the power of the analysis was apparently low
when analyzing a single taxon at a time, since only 14.8%,
34.2 and 38.5% of sites simulated as positively selected
were effectively detected in Brassica, A. halleri, and A. lyrata respectively. In contrast, the multi-species screen had
substantially higher power. On average, collectively considering all sites detected by at least one of the three taxa
allowed us to effectively identify 59.2% of all positively
selected sites. This increased power of the multi-species
screen was accompanied by a slight decrease of accuracy
to 0.86, still suggesting that the identification of sites in
the ω > 1 category was reliable.

Although selective constraints were identical across the
three taxa in the simulations (i.e. the same codons were
simulated as evolving under positive selection), the match
between sites identified in the three taxa was surprisingly
poor and comparable to the observed match. Thus, in the
simulations, an average of 47.0% of sites detected in A.
halleri were also identified in A. lyrata, 16.1% of sites
detected in A. halleri were also identified in Brassica and
17.1% of sites detected in A. lyrata were also identified in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/132

Brassica. None of these simulated levels of concordance
differed significantly from the observed levels (p = 0.77,
0.57 and 0.67, respectively). Thus, separately analyzing
such divergent sequences from three taxa that evolved
under identical evolutionary constraints indeed led to the
identification of different codon sites in the different taxa,
and the observed low concordance was within the
expected range. As shown in Fig. 4, there was also no evidence that sequence divergence alone could be responsible for the observed variation in posterior ω among the
three taxa. In the simulations, ratios among estimated
posterior ωs in the three taxa never even approached the
observed value of 2.038 (p < 0.01).

A. halleri and A. lyrata than in Brassica.

Simulations of sequence evolution with different tree
lengths confirmed that the low level of concordance was
partly due to overall low statistical power. The number of
detected sites remained in all cases much lower (maximum = 9 sites in Brassica and A. halleri, 11 sites in A. lyrata) than the actual number of sites simulated as evolving
under positive selection (on expectation, the same 19 sites
for all species), thus confirming that the method had low
power (Fig. 5). Consistent with [27], our simulations
showed that power was initially low when sequences were
only slightly divergent (zero sites detected with sequence
divergence <5 substitutions per codon), then increased at
intermediate levels of divergence and then started to
decrease again when sequence divergence reached saturation. Interestingly, the observed level of sequence divergence in A. halleri and A. lyrata was almost coincident with
the peak of maximal power, while for Brassica, maximum
power was attained at higher sequence divergence than
actually observed. Tree length also had no detectable
effect on accuracy, since there was no increase in the rate
of false positives with sequence divergence (data not
shown). These results suggested that high sequence divergence would result in lower power, but without increasing
the rate of false positives.

Discussion
Twenty-two SRK sequences in A. halleri
Combining results from this study with those from [22], a
total of twenty-two S-alleles have been identified and
sequenced in A. halleri, together with several other members of the S-gene family previously identified in A. lyrata.
Co-segregation and linkage to the incompatibility phenotype has been demonstrated for the eight S-alleles tested
(AhSRK01, AhSRK04, AhSRK12 and AhSRK21 in [22];
AhSRK15, AhSRK21, AlSRK14 and AlSRK21 in this study).
By tracing recombinants in a backcross involving a F1
hybrid between A. halleri and A. lyrata with genotype
AhSRK01/AlSRK21, [31] also demonstrated that the functional S-locus is localized at a position analogous to the
ψSRK position in A. thaliana [32]. These observations are
particularly important because [28] showed that SRK
sequences in A. lyrata do not show 100% monophyly, as
two unlinked sequences (Aly13-2 and Aly13-7) were
found to be nested within the SRK cluster. Our results
confirm that these two sequences seem to be exceptions,
since all other putative SRK sequences that have been
identified and tested have proven to be linked to selfincompatibility (see e.g. [33]). Consistent with these
sequences belonging to SRK, and thus evolving under
strong balancing selection causing long coalescence times
[34], we found that 12 of the 22 putative S-alleles in A.
halleri form trans-specific pairs with high similarity with Salleles sequences from A. lyrata. Overall, the level of diversity among putative S-alleles in A. halleri is comparable to
that reported for SRK haplotypes in A. lyrata [35].

sites evolving under positive selection. In the simulations, an average of 19 sites were assigned to evolve under
positive selection (see text for simulation parameters). The
level of sequence divergence estimated from the combined A.
halleri, A. lyrata and Brassica sequences is 23.47 substitutions
per codon. Results are averages over 5 independent replicates. The dashed vertical line represents the observed level
of divergence estimated from the analysis of the 3 taxa combined.

Indeed, this level of diversity is the highest ever-reported
in A. halleri, both in terms of the number of different haplotypes (20 sequences here plus 2 sequences previously
reported in [22] = 22 different sequences in a total of 36
individuals) and in terms of sequence polymorphism. The
most exhaustive study of sequence polymorphism to date
in A. halleri reported a mean silent nucleotide diversity πS
= 0.015 (range [0.0025–0.0569], [36]) across eight independent genes, while we observed πS = 0.819 in exon 1 of
SRK, i.e. a 54 fold increase in diversity. Analyzing the pattern of variation across the whole gene, we see no clear
relationship between synonymous nucleotide diversity
and distance from the S-domain, as noted already by [34]
in A. lyrata. As we also showed that positively selected sites
are only occurring in exon 1, this suggests that the high

diversity observed in exons 2 to 6 is due to genetic hitchhiking and also that intragenic recombination is very low.
How many sites evolve under positive selection?
The PAML approach has been extremely successful in
revealing protein evolution in a variety of situations. Our
study empirically demonstrates the limits but still usefulness of this approach in a case of extreme sequence divergence. Although the power of the analysis was low in any
of the three taxa, the accuracy remained very high. This
observation is consistent with results of a simulation
study by [27], who revealed that the accuracy remained
high and that increasing the number of lineages was the
best way to increase statistical power, even at high levels
of divergence. Our approach, combining sets of sites
revealed by at least one taxon (25 codons revealed) was
apparently more powerful than defining the set of sites
from a single dataset containing all three taxa (19 codons
revealed), so we conclude that 25 codon sites over 180
(13.9%) are identified as evolving under positive selection. Because of limited statistical power of the analysis,
however, this represents only a fraction of all sites truly
evolving under positive selection. Our simulations
allowed us to estimate that the power of this multi-species
screen was 59.8%. By extrapolation, we thus estimate that
25/0.598 = 41.8 of the 180 codon sites have evolved
under positive selection, i.e. almost a quarter of the sites
in the sequence could be involved in recognition. This
proportion is higher than that reported in [26] in Brassica
(6.38% of sites) and also higher than those recently
reported in the gametophytic self-incompatibility pollen
SFB gene in Prunus spinosa (23 out of 315 sites = 7.3%,
[37]) and the gametophytic self-incompatibility pistil SRNase gene in Lycium parishii (7 out of 130 sites = 5.4%,
[38]). As we showed here, a possible explanation for this
difference is that the screens used in these studies may also
have had low power. Collectively, these results thus indicate that a large proportion of sites in self-incompatibility
genes are probably involved in the molecular interaction
determining compatibility.
Location of sites under positive selection
Because of the low level of false positives revealed by our
simulations, sites belonging to the ω > 1 category should
be considered as reliable candidates for further functional
analyses. These codons were strongly clustered in hypervariable regions, and we checked that this observation was
not an artifact due to variation in evolution rate at synonymous sites. Our results thus support previous claims of
the functional importance of hypervariable regions [1421,25]. Interestingly, however, their distribution across
HV2, HV3 and CVR differed strongly among the three
taxa, with HV3 containing most sites detected in Brassica,
while this region contained a very low number of positively selected sites in A. halleri and A. lyrata. In line with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/132

[9], this raises the intriguing possibility that functionally
important parts of the proteins may differ along different
allelic lineages. However, although our simulation
approach demonstrated that the number of false positives
remained very low, it also demonstrated that such a poor
concordance among sites identified in different taxa is
consistent with the analysis of highly divergent sequences.
More intense selection in Brassica ?
Our study also revealed that the observed higher posterior
ω estimate in Brassica as compared to A. halleri and A. lyrata was outside the expected range of random variation
computed from simulations, possibly suggesting more
intense selection in Brassica. How should higher posterior
ω in Brassica as compared to A. halleri and A. lyrata be
interpreted biologically? All three taxa most probably
inherited a common set of alleles from their ancestor.
Although the number of alleles is comparably high in the
three taxa, Brassica alleles cluster in two main lineages,
whereas all A. halleri and A. lyrata alleles are highly divergent from one another. A possible explanation for this difference is that the genus Brassica went through a severe
bottleneck that drastically reduced the number of alleles.
As noted by [39], the intensity of balancing selection on
an S-locus is inversely related to the number of alleles in a
population. Thus, balancing selection may have been very
intense, leading to strong selection for allelic diversification shortly after the putative bottleneck. How strong a
bottleneck can generate such a difference in posterior ω
remains to be determined.
Balancing vs. positive selection: exploring the limits of
PAML
Although phylogenetic methods to detect natural selection on protein coding sequences have initially been
developed for between-species comparisons, there is an
increasing interest in adapting these methods to the analysis of intraspecific polymorphism. Our data can be used
to evaluate some limits of this approach.

A first limit is that our simulation procedure assumed a
constant ω for each codon across the whole phylogeny.
This is unlikely to be true, since frequency-dependent
selection implies that an allele's selection regime varies
together with its frequency. Indeed, a newly arisen allele
initially experiences positive selection as long as it
remains below its equilibrium frequency. Once equilibrium has been reached, the allele is then actively maintained by balancing selection, not positive selection
anymore. ω values are thus expected to change along each
branch of the phylogeny, such that their precise interpretation is unclear in the context of frequency-dependent
selection.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/132

A second limit is that our approach assumes no recombination. Simulations by [40] have shown that the presence
of recombination affects the power to detect selection
because PAML assumes a single tree for the whole protein,
whereas recombination leads to different gene genealogies in different regions of the gene. Currently available
methods to estimate jointly recombination and selective
pressures along the gene (e.g. [41]) rely on explicit population genetics models, while we obtained a single
sequence for each SRK haplotype in the whole species.
Accurate allele frequency data are thus not available, currently preventing us from taking recombination formally
into account. Although we acknowledge that this will be
important once appropriate data are available, we think
that recombination is probably not causing bias in the
analyses for the following reasons. As shown by [40],
PAML is indeed relatively tolerant for a certain range in
the recombination rate, especially with models M7 and
M8. In addition, the existence of separate genes for the
pollen and pistil recognition functions apparently causes
suppressed recombination to maintain coadapted sets of
the two different loci. Accordingly, comparison between
physical and genetic maps of the chromosome carrying
the S-locus indeed showed reduced recombination in the
SI region in A. lyrata [42]. In line with [35], reduced
recombination is compatible with our observation of no
significant decrease of LD across the S-domain as well as
with a strong hitchhiking effect on synonymous nucleotide variation throughout the kinase domain of SRK.

ulated datasets, making the comparison robust to such
effects.

A third limit of the parametric bootstrap approach used to
investigate power and accuracy is that it relies on parameters estimated from the data. Given the important divergence observed among sequences, saturation is likely to
occur and divergence is probably the most poorly estimated parameter of our analysis. In particular, the length
of the long internal branches of the tree used to simulate
sequence evolution is probably poorly estimated. In addition, the three taxa analyzed have very contrasted allelic
phylogenies. Brassica has a single long internal branch
separating the two dominance classes, while A. lyrata and
A. halleri have numerous long branches, so the number of
non-synonymous substitutions may be underestimated
more severely in A. lyrata and A. halleri than in Brassica,
thus providing a potential explanation for the lower ω in
A. halleri or A. lyrata than in Brassica. Could uncertainty in
branch length estimation have affected our conclusions?
Our simulations revealed that power declined with
sequence divergence more quickly than accuracy of the
posterior ω estimation. Thus, the signal of positive selection was lost before any bias in the BEB posterior ω estimation could be detected. Our simulation approach
mimics the generation of real datasets, such that any bias
due to saturation would be present in both real and sim-

Molecular methods
In line with the notation proposed by [33], AhSRKx,
AlSRKx, BoSRKx and BrSRKx refer to haplotype x in A.
halleri, A. lyrata, B. oleraceae and B. rapa, respectively.
Nearly full-length sequences for AhSRK04 and AhSRK10
were taken from [22]. A. lyrata sequences (n = 24) were
taken from [33] and Brassica sequences (n = 19) from
[26]. SRK polymorphism in A. halleri was first screened
using the S-domain only.

Conclusion
This is the first report of sequence polymorphism at the
female specificity determinant gene SRK in the selfincompatible Arabidopsis halleri. Sequence polymorphism
was extremely high, and twenty-five codons showed signs
of positive selection in either A. halleri, A. lyrata or
Brassica. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the signature of balancing selection can be identified reliably at
the codon level and estimate that over 20% of all codons
in the S-domain may actually be involved in recognition.
Brassica had higher posterior rates of non-synonymous to
synonymous substitutions than either A. halleri or A. lyrata, possibly suggesting that allelic diversification in this
genus was both more recent and more intense than in
either A. halleri or A. lyrata.

Methods
Plant material
A total of 36 A. halleri individuals was screened for SRK
polymorphism. Individuals were collected from 17 widely
distributed European populations (Table 1). A single individual was analyzed per population, except in Auby,
where 16 individuals were analyzed and in AL08 and
TC05, where two individuals were analyzed (Table 1).
Fresh leaves were dried overnight at 55°C and DNA was
extracted using the extraction kit Dneasy® from Qiagen®.

Because of the lack of fully conserved regions along the Sdomain, several primer pairs were used in an attempt to
identify the largest possible set of different alleles (primer
sequences and amplification conditions in [18]).
13SEQ2F and SLGR were used as forward and reverse
primers, respectively, for all individuals, and 13SEQ1F
and SLGF were used as forward primers in combination
with SLGR for a subset of individuals where either a single
or no allele was identified with 13SEQ2F-SLGR. Amplification products were ligated into plasmids and transformed into chemically competent bacteria using the
TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen Corporation) according
to the manufacturer's protocol. An average of 8 positive
clones per individual (1–45) were sequenced using the
vector's M13 forward and reverse sequencing primers and

BigDye3.1 (Appplied Biosystems) sequencing kit on an
ABI3100 capillary sequencer. Sequences were edited using
MEGA3 [43] and searched with BLASTN against a local
library of sequences containing all published sequences of
the S-family in A. lyrata [22,33,34,44]. Sequences whose
closest match was one of the A. lyrata alleles demonstrated
to be linked to the SI phenotype were provisionally considered to also be SRK alleles in A. halleri. Among those,
sequences with a maximum divergence of 8.1% (average
A. halleri-A. lyrata divergence across 10 unlinked genes;
[22]) were considered as "matching alleles" of either
ancestral origin or introgression. Sequences whose closest
match was a member of the gene family in A. lyrata were
considered as paralogues. Since Aly13-2 and Aly13-7 in A.
lyrata were found to be independent from the SI phenotype [18], matches to these sequences were excluded. To
correct for PCR errors, positive clones were then screened
further until at least three replicates were obtained for
each of these sequences. Majority-rule consensus
sequences were obtained by manual correction.
Evidence for the presence of a kinase domain linked to the
S-domain was then searched in several of the putative Salleles using allele-specific forward primers designed from
the S-domain sequence in conjunction with general
degenerate reverse primers from the kinase domain :
R4997 : CACCKYGARTCTTKGTGAAG or R4694 :
AVATTTTCCAAGTAYTCRTA designed from an alignment
of the published SRK kinase domain sequences in A. lyrata. The PCR products obtained were sequenced directly
as reported above, using intermediate internal sequencing
primers to tile the sequences entirely.
Segregation analyses
We tested for co-segregation of two pairs of putative SRK
haplotypes among offspring obtained from an interspecific cross between A. halleri (pollen donor) and A. lyrata
(pollen receiver). Seeds were allowed to germinate in
small pots and seedlings were harvested, dried and DNA
was extracted as described above. Offspring were genotyped using primers specific to each of the four SRK haplotypes of the parents (V. Castric, unpublished results). To
test for an association between putative SRK genotypes
and incompatibility phenotypes, we performed controlled pollinations among offspring of this cross and estimated compatibility of the genotypes through
measurements of fruit-set.
Structural and diversity analysis
Nucleotide sequences were trimmed to the shortest and
translated into amino acid sequences in MEGA3.1. To preserve the amino acid numbering of the sequence, A. halleri
and A. lyrata amino acid sequences were all aligned to the
alignment profile used in [26], kindly provided by R. Sainudiin) using CLUSTALX [45] followed by manual adjust-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/132

ments in the alignment editor in MEGA3.1. In accordance
with [26], codon positions in the alignment were numbered from the ATG codon of BoSRK60. N-linked glycosylation sites along the amino acid sequences [46,47]
were identified using N-GLYCOSITE [48,49]. Variation of
amino acid diversity was investigated along the sequence
by sliding a 5 amino acids window with a step of 1 amino
acid. We tested for recombination by comparing the relationship between a measure of linkage disequilibrium (r2)
and the distance between polymorphic sites, as implemented in the software package LDHAT 2.0 [50]. Significance of the correlation was determined from 1,000
permutations of the variable sites.
Sites under positive selection
Sites evolving under positive selection were searched for
using the codon-based model implemented in CODEML
in the PAML analysis package [51] using the "complete
deletion" option, i.e. only sites with no indel in any of the
sequences were included in the analysis. Briefly, a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using
DNA-ML from the PHYLIP package [52] for sequences of
each taxon separately, as well as for combined datasets
including all three taxa. Given this topology, the log-likelihood of models M7, M8a and M8 of [53] were compared
using a likelihood ratio test (LRT). Models M7 and M8a
allow the different codon sites along the sequence to
evolve under a range of beta-distributed ω ratios (0 <ω <
1 for M7 and 0 <ω ≤ 1 for M8a), thus simulating a range
of constraints by purifying -but not positive- selection. M8
includes all these features, but has an additional category
for sites with ω > 1, thus allowing for positively selected
sites. Given the proposed tree topology, CODEML uses
Felsenstein's pruning algorithm to sum over all possible
ancestral states and maximize the overall likelihood of
model M8 for the observed sequences. This procedure
thus provides maximum likelihood estimates for the
codon substitution model, the transition/transversion
ratio κ, the overall number of nucleotide substitutions per
codon (tree length) and the distribution of replacement
vs. silent substitutions dN/dS = ω. Since model M7 is nested
within model M8, a LRT with two degrees of freedom was
used to determine whether M8 provides a comparatively
better fit than M8, and thus whether positively selected
sites occur along the sequence. A LRT with one degree of
freedom was used to compare M8a with M8 [54]. The
Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) procedure [55] was then
used to estimate at each site the probability that it belongs
to the ω > 1 category. Sites having a probability >0.95 of
belonging to this category were referred to as "positively
selected" sites. We compared the strength of selection
between hypervariable regions and the rest of the protein
using two approaches. We first used the hypergeometric
distribution to determine whether these sites clustered
within hypervariable regions. We then used HYPHY

Page 12 of 15

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:132

V.0.99 [56] to compare the likelihood of a model allowing different ω for HV regions and the rest of the protein
with that of a model constraining them to be equal (the
"fixed-sites" approach described in [57], LRT with one
degree of freedom). We also used HYPHY to test for differences in rate of synonymous substitutions between HV
regions and the rest of the protein, as such differences
could lead to misidentification of sites as positively
selected [58]. The locations of positively selected sites in
A. halleri and A. lyrata were compared with those obtained
from the analysis in Brassica. The level of pairwise concordance was determined as the average proportion of
sites retrieved in a taxon that were also retrieved in the
other taxon. For each taxon, posterior ω were averaged
over all positively selected sites. As advocated in [27],
robustness to the exact model specification was assessed
by comparing sites retrieved by M8 with those retrieved by
M2a, a simpler model where all sites evolving under purifying selection belong to a single category. The sensitivity
of the method to the exact tree topology was assessed by
running M8 under a subset of trees of the 95% credible set
of trees obtained in MRBAYES version 3.1 [59], implementing a general reversible time 4×4 nucleotides transition model with equal rates across sites. Two independent
MCMC chains were run for 1,000,000 iterations and trees
were sampled every 100 iterations after discarding the first
2,500 for burn-in.
Simulations
The following parametric bootstrap approach was then
used to determine whether the observed concordance
between sites retrieved by all three taxa was indeed
expected given the observed phylogeny. The program
EVOLVER in the PAML package was used to simulate 100
replicates of sequence evolution with a fixed proportion
of sites evolving under positive selection. All parameters
used for these simulations, including the number of
codons evolving under positive selection, were assigned
their maximum likelihood estimates under model M8
obtained using the whole dataset that included all three
taxa (22, 24 and 19 sequences in A. halleri, A. lyrata and
Brassica, respectively, i.e. 65 sequences total). The simulated sequences obtained were then separated into three
subgroups corresponding to the three taxa and were analyzed separately with the same CODEML procedure as
described above. Given that sites evolving under positive
selection in the simulations were identical across all three
taxa, we expected that the analysis in each taxon should
consistently retrieve the same sites. Thus, the level of pairwise concordance of each simulated dataset was compared to that of the real data. In addition, since sites
evolving under positive selection were known in the simulations, these simulations enabled us to quantify the statistical power of the BEB procedure when model M8 was
analyzed with sequences from a single taxon. Following

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/132

[27], power was defined as the proportion of sites actually
evolving under positive selection that the analysis was
able to detect. Accuracy was defined as 1 minus the rate of
false positives and assessed by analyzing with model M8
100 replicate simulations where no site evolved under
positive selection (model M7). Power and accuracy were
also investigated using all sites detected by any of the taxa,
i.e. on the combined set of sites across all three taxa independently. Because the results revealed large differences
among taxa in posterior BEB ω estimations (averaged
across sites classified in the ω > 1 category), the simulated
sequences used to assess power were also used to determine whether such differences were compatible with a
null model where all sequences evolved according to the
same ω distribution.
We then investigated the effect of decreasing or increasing
sequence divergence on power, accuracy and the posterior
ω estimate. We simulated different levels of sequence
divergence by varying the overall number of nucleotide
substitutions per codon (tree length 5–150 nucleotide
substitutions per codon), thus simulating evolution for
shorter or longer periods of time. Simulations were run
along the fixed ML-topology including all three taxa, and
datasets were analyzed separately for each taxon. Five and
150 nucleotide substitutions per codon site distributed
over the whole 65-sequences phylogeny were chosen to
represent realistically low and high extremes of sequence
divergence, respectively. Power, accuracy and posterior ω
estimate results were determined and averaged over five
independent replicates for each level of divergence.
