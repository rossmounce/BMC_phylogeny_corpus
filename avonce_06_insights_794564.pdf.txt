Abstract
Background: The compatible solute trehalose is a non-reducing disaccharide, which accumulates
upon heat, cold or osmotic stress. It was commonly accepted that trehalose is only present in
extremophiles or cryptobiotic organisms. However, in recent years it has been shown that
although higher plants do not accumulate trehalose at significant levels they have actively
transcribed genes encoding the corresponding biosynthetic enzymes.
Results: In this study we show that trehalose biosynthesis ability is present in eubacteria, archaea,
plants, fungi and animals. In bacteria there are five different biosynthetic routes, whereas in fungi,
plants and animals there is only one. We present phylogenetic analyses of the trehalose-6phosphate synthase (TPS) and trehalose-phosphatase (TPP) domains and show that there is a close
evolutionary relationship between these domains in proteins from diverse organisms. In bacteria
TPS and TPP genes are clustered, whereas in eukaryotes these domains are fused in a single
protein.
Conclusion: We have demonstrated that trehalose biosynthesis pathways are widely distributed
in nature. Interestingly, several eubacterial species have multiple pathways, while eukaryotes have
only the TPS/TPP pathway. Vertebrates lack trehalose biosynthetic capacity but can catabolise it.
TPS and TPP domains have evolved mainly in parallel and it is likely that they have experienced
several instances of gene duplication and lateral gene transfer.

Background
One of the fundamental challenges for an organism is to
survive changes in the physical environment-mainly
extreme temperatures, salinity, or dehydration. This problem was to be solved very early in evolution since the first
cells inhabited the primitive seas [1,2]. Organisms
evolved two different strategies to contend with abiotic
stress. In certain species that live in extreme environments, for instance strict thermophiles and halophiles,

the metabolic capabilities were modified, such that the
optimal enzymatic activity or membrane stability are at
high temperature or salinity, respectively [3]. Other organisms when exposed to extreme conditions have a drastically different adaptation to contend with stress. They
evolved biosynthetic pathways for osmotically active
compounds, cryoprotectants or thermoprotectants, thus
enabling survival until conditions are favourable again.
Among these compounds are polyols such as mannitol,

sorbitol, some amino acids (proline and glutamic acid);
quaternary ammonium salts, for instance glycine betaine;
and disaccharides, for example sucrose and trehalose [4].
This latter compound is a non-reducing disaccharide
formed by two glucose molecules linked by a 1α-1α bond
which is present in several organisms and common foodstuffs such as bread, wine, beer, vinegar, and honey [5].
Many functions have been described for trehalose-for
instance in prokaryotes trehalose is frequently used as a
compatible solute to contend with osmotic stress and can
be used as an external carbon source [6-8]. In bacteria of
the genera Mycobacteria, Nocardia, Rhodococcus and Corynebacterium, trehalose is present in the cell wall glycolipids
[8-10]. In yeast, trehalose can be used as a reserve compound [11,12] and for the adaptive response to different
types of abiotic stress [8,13-16]. Also, it has been shown
that in yeast trehalose 6-phosphate, the trehalose biosynthesis intermediate is a regulator of the glucose metabolic
flux during glycolysis [17-20].
In several organisms trehalose is capable of stabilising and
protect membranes and proteins, allowing anhydrobiotic
organisms to survive cycles of dehydration-rehydration
[21,22]. In insects trehalose is the most abundant sugar in
the haemolymph (80–90%) and in thorax muscles, were
it is consumed during flight [10,23]. Until recently, it was
thought that in plants trehalose was only synthesised in
the so-called "resurrection" plants such as Selaginella lepidophylla and Myrothammus flabellifolius, where it is the key
molecule to protect against stress, especially drought.
However, a large number of studies with transgenic
plants, along with the sequencing information available
for many plant genomes, suggest that trehalose can be
synthesised in several other plants. Furthermore, in Arabidopsis thaliana it has been demonstrated that trehalose has
a fundamental role in embryo development [24], and in
abscisic acid and sugar signalling [25].
There are at least five biosynthetic pathways known for
trehalose (Figure 1). The first pathway was discovered
about 50 years ago [26], is the most widely distributed,
and it has been reported in eubacteria, archaea, fungi,
insects, and plants. It involves two enzymatic steps catalyzed by trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and trehalose-phosphatase (TPP). TPS catalyzes the transfer of
glucose from UDP-glucose to glucose 6-phosphate forming trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) and UDP, while TPP
dephosphorylates T6P to trehalose and inorganic phosphate [5,9] (Figure 1A). In the second biosynthetic pathway, the enzyme trehalose synthase (TS) isomerises the
α1-α4 bond of maltose to a α1-α1 bond, forming trehalose [5,27]. This enzyme was first reported in Pimelobacter
sp. and orthologs of this protein have been found in other
eubacteria (Figure 1B). The third pathway involves the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/109

conversion of maltodextrines (maltooligosaccharides,
glycogen and starch) to trehalose. This pathway was
reported in thermophilic archaea of the genus Sulfolobus.
These organisms synthesize trehalose in two enzymatic
steps catalyzed by maltooligosyl trehalose synthase
(TreY), coded by the treY gene, which promotes the transglycosylation of the last glucose moiety at the reduced end
of maltodextrins from a α1-α4 to a α1-α1 bond leading to
maltooligosyltrehalose, which contains a trehalose moiety at the end of the polymer. Next, maltooligosyl trehalose trehalohydrolase (TreZ), coded by the treZ gene,
catalyses the hydrolytic release of trehalose (Figure 1C)
[5,28]. In the fourth pathway, trehalose phosphorylase
(TreP), present in some fungi, catalyses the reversible
hydrolysis of trehalose in the presence of inorganic phosphate. The transfer of a glucose molecule to a phosphate
generates glucose 1-phosphate and releases the other glucose residue. There is uncertainty about the participation
of the TreP enzyme in the synthesis or degradation of trehalose, since the biosynthetic reaction has only been
shown in vitro [29,30] (Figure 1D). A new biosynthetic
pathway for trehalose was found in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus litoralis, and involves the
trehalose glycosyltransferring synthase (TreT), which
catalyses the reversible formation of trehalose from ADPglucose and glucose [31,32]. It can also use UDP-glucose
and GDP-glucose, although it is less efficient with these
substrates. The TreT enzyme transfers the glucose moiety
from ADP-glucose, and joins it at position 1 of another
glucose molecule to form trehalose (Figure 1E). Trehalose
is degraded by trehalase (TreH) into two glucose molecules (Fig. 1F).
In this work, the presence in the completely sequenced
genomes of genes coding for the trehalose biosynthetic
enzymes was analysed. We found that these enzymes are
widely distributed in the three domains of life and moreover, many organisms have more than one, and sometimes several pathways for trehalose synthesis. Also, we
inferred the phylogenetic relationships of TPS and TPP
enzymes. Interestingly, we found that they have significantly coevolved. This is supported by the fact that in
prokaryotes the genes coding for these enzymes are generally organised as a single operon, while in eukaryotes
there are multigene families, generally each member coding for a fused polypeptide with TPS and TPP domains.
The functionality of many of these genes is supported by
the observation that the catalytically relevant residues for
both TPS and TPP are highly conserved.

Results and discussion
Distribution of trehalose pathways
To identify genes involved in the five known pathways for
trehalose biosynthesis, we carried out BLAST searches [33]
using the amino acid sequences from enzymes of several

organisms with the NCBI non-redundant databases of
proteins. Homologues with significant scores (expect
value >E-9, see Methods) were identified in a wide range of
organisms including archaea, eubacteria, plants, fungi,
and animals (Figure 2A).
Information from the completely sequenced genomes
allowed us to identify the presence of each of the five different trehalose biosynthesis pathways in individual
organisms. For this study 205 genomes were analysed,
171 from eubacteria, 18 from archaea, 8 from fungi, 3
from mammals, 2 from plants, 2 from insects and one
from a nematode. Selected sequences for further analysis
are shown in Additional file 1. Since the number of
sequenced genomes is not uniform for each taxonomic
group, the presence of trehalose biosynthetic protein

domains is shown as the percentage value related to the
total genomes with at least one pathway (Figure 2B).
Prokaryotes showed the greatest distribution of trehalose
pathways (see Additional file 1). Eubacteria was the only
group where the five pathways were found although not
all together in a single species, most of them having from
two to four pathways. The presence of several biosynthetic
pathways in the same organism may be due to the strict
requirement to accumulate trehalose under changeable
environmental conditions, which could limit substrate
availability for each pathway. A number of eubacterial
species have multiple copies of some of these pathways.
For example, Mesorhizobium loti, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Ralstonia solanacearum and Xanthomonas campestris
have two TPS genes, while Thermoanaerobacter tengcongen-

sis has two genes for trehalose phosphorylase (treP). M.
loti has a truncated copy of TPS, which we excluded from
analyses. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that paralogous
TPS genes are the product of lateral gene transfer events
instead of recent gene duplications (see below). Interestingly, the TS pathway might be exclusive to eubacteria,
while TreT was only observed in Archaea and Thermotoga
maritima, a thermophilic eubacteria which inherited a
substantial part of its genome from Archaea by lateral
gene transfer [34]. In fungi, plants and invertebrates only
the TPS/TPP pathway is present; no homologues to other
trehalose biosynthetic genes were found. Interestingly,
none of the five described trehalose biosynthesis pathways was found in vertebrates, although the presence of
TreH, the trehalose catabolic enzyme, has been reported
in this group of organisms [5].
The above analyses show that trehalose biosynthesis pathways have a patchy distribution across biological groups,
ranging from the coexistence of several pathways in
eubacterial species, to a single pathway in eukaryotes.
Plants contain multiple TPS/TPP sequences. It would be
interesting to explore the functionality of these reiterated
gene copies.
Functional adaptation of TPS/TPP enzymes
In order to address the functionality of the multiple copies
of eukaryotic TPS/TPP genes, we analysed whether the relevant amino acid positions are conserved in these proteins (see Additional file 2). The reported 3D structure of
the E. coli TPS enzyme allowed the identification of the
amino acid residues involved in the binding of substrates
and in catalysis [35]. The residues involved in the binding
of glucose 6-phosphate are Arg9, Trp40, Tyr76, Trp85 and
Arg300, while Gly22, Asp130, His154, Arg262, Asp361
and Glu369 are involved in the binding of UDP-glucose
[35]. Interestingly, several proteins of Arabidopsis and
yeast that do not complement a ∆TPS1 mutant of S. cerevisiae [36,37] lack several of these residues. In contrast, all
these residues are conserved in proteins displaying TPS
activity so far reported, or from organisms that are known
to produce trehalose (Additional file 3). There are eight
TPS genes in Arabidopsis but only AtTPS1 and AtTPS2
proteins have these residues, and the enzymatic activity
has only been demonstrated for AtTPS1 [38]. None of the
TPS sequences of Oryza sativa have these residues conserved and we did not find any other gene of an alternative trehalose biosynthetic route in this organism (see
additional file 2). However, trehalose is accumulated in
rice upon salt stress [39].

The sequence analysis of plant and fungal TPS proteins,
which do not have the conserved positions, showed that
they have been selected only with very limited substitutions. One of the most prominent changes is R262D in A.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/109

thaliana and O. sativa versus R262Q/K in S. cerevisiae and
S. pombe; W40Y/F was only found in plants.
TPP belong to the HAD (L-2-haloacid dehalogenase)
superfamily of magnesium-dependent phosphatases/
phosphotransferases, which is distributed in both
prokaryotes and eukaryotes [40,42]. This superfamily uses
a common catalytic reaction mechanism characterised by
having three highly conserved motifs. Region 1 (motif 1)
near to the N-terminal end, contains the DXDX(T/V)
sequence, where the first aspartic acid residue forms a
phosphorylated intermediate with the substrate, while the
second residue plays an important role in catalysis.
Region 2 (motif 2) has a conserved serine or threonine (S/
T)(GX), which serves to form a hydrogen bond with a
phosphate group of the substrate. Region 3 (motif 3) contains the K(X)16–30(G/S)(D/S)XXX(D/N) sequence
being part of the active site and coordinates the magnesium ion required for catalysis [40,41]. Recently, the crystalographic structure of TPP from Thermoplasma
acidophilum was determined [42].
In the present work we asked the question whether the
mentioned motifs are conserved within the sequences of
the TPP domains. Most TPPs such as OtsB, ScTPS2,
AtTPPA-B, and AtTPS5-11 proteins contain the highly
conserved residues of HAD superfamily active site in the
three conserved regions and also displayed a high degree
of similarity in the rest of the protein (see Additional file
4). The data showed significant similarity among archaea,
eubacterial, fungi and plant TPP. However AtTPS1 to 4
and 8, S. cerevisiae_3 and 4 (ScTPS3 y ScTS11), S. pombe_4
and _5, and E. gossypi_3 proteins lack these conserved
positions (see Additional file 5). Therefore it is unlikely
that these proteins could have the phosphatase activity.
Similarly, in OsTPS_2 the conserved arginine of motif 2
has been replaced by phenylalanine. The absence of residues directly implicated in catalysis as evidenced by 3D
structure imply that these proteins are not phosphatases
although the remaining domain is conserved.
Search of functional TPS isoforms
Since the majority of TPS/TPP fusion proteins lack the
ability to complement TPS or TPP deficient yeast strains,
it is possible that they are non-functional enzymes. Alternatively, they could have acquired new functions. In order
to predict possible functionality of these proteins we
determined the selective pressure at the amino acid level
for each of the TPS and TPP domains of eukaryotic proteins (Additional file 6). The rate of mutagenesis substitutions, ω, is calculated by comparing the ratio of nonsynonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitutions, ω =
dN/dS. If ω is negative, it means that the majority of accumulated substitutions at each codon are synonymous,
indicating that natural selection is acting upon these posi-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:109

tions to preserve functionality (purifying selection). On
the contrary, when ω value is positive, non-synonymous
substitutions have been accumulated at a greater extent,
indicating that positive or adaptive selection has taken
place [43]. In practice it has been difficult to observe clear
cases of positive selection since the early methods averaged ω over the entire sequence and in all sequences analyzed. There are refined methods to allow site and lineage
specific analysis of codon substitutions [44]. The data
obtained with SLAC [45] and PAML [44,46] programs
show that practically all codon substitutions found in the
DNA sequences encoding both TPS and TPP domains
were synonymous at the protein level, i.e. the ω value was
very small for both domains. Only five codons from TPP
domain were detected with a positive ω, whereas all TPS
residues showed a negative value (see Additional file 6).
These data indicate that both proteins are under strong
purifying selection and, therefore, they must maintain
some function, perhaps related to their original enzymatic
activity, and that they are not on the process of becoming
pseudogenes or are under strong adaptive selection.
Physical organisation of the TPS/TPP domains
The TPS protein is formed by a single phosphatase
domain in prokaryotes while in almost all eukaryotes and
in P. aerophylum the TPS proteins are fused to the TPP
domain. This organization suggests that all the eukaryotic
TPS and TPP fused proteins descend from a common
ancestor (see Additional file 7). Thus, it is likely that those
proteins that do not present this gene fusion, such as E.
gossypii_1, S. cerevisiae_1, S. pombe_1 and E. cuniculi proteins, have lost its TPP domain. C. elegans_1 and C.
elegans_2 proteins are not fused to TPP and are clustered
with Streptomyces apart from the rest of the eukaryotic
proteins (see below).

Therefore, we decided to explore if there is a phylogenetic
relationship between the TPS and TPP domains, at both
the protein structural organization (fusion domains) in
eukaryotes, and by the genomic context (gene neighbourhood) in prokaryotes. To analyze the genomic context we
used the GeCont server [47], which displays the neighbouring genes of any gene in the fully sequenced genomes
[48]. The results found in this study showed a high conservation of the genomic linkage of the TPS and TPP proteins in eubacteria and in archaea, very likely forming part
of a single operon. The only exceptions are bacteria of the
genus Mycobacterium, cyanobacteria and S. meliloti in
which the TPS and TPP coding genes are not clustered in
the genome.
What is the evolutionary significance of TPS and TPP
fusion in eukaryotic proteins? Interestingly, although
there are eukaryotic proteins comprised by the two
domains [49], so far an enzyme with both TPS and TPP

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/109

activities has not been found. On the other hand, some
putative TPS/TPP fusion proteins lack both enzymatic
activities and are only regulatory subunits, such as ScTPS3
and ScTSL1 [37]. According to the analysis of TPS and TPP
consensus regions, we identified three proteins in P. aerophilum, D. melanogaster and A. gambiae species, conserving the residues and active sites of both TPS and TPP
domains. These are the first putative TPS/TPP fusion proteins with the two domains found so far. An active bifunctional enzyme has been obtained artificially by fusing the
E. coli OtsA and OtsB domains, to yield a chimerical
enzyme with both TPS and TPP activities and trehalose
biosynthesis capacity in E. coli and O. sativa [50,51]. These
rice transgenic plants were stress tolerant. Similarly, we
constructed a bifunctional TPS/TPP fusion protein using
the S. cerevisiae domains and it is active both in yeast and
A. thaliana [unpublished results].
The genomic linkage and fusion in a single polypeptide of
TPS and TPP strongly suggest that they have evolved in
parallel. To test this hypothesis we performed a phylogenetic analysis of TPS and TPP enzymes.
Phylogenetic analysis of the TPS proteins
In order to explore the evolutionary patterns of the TPS
and TPP proteins, we performed a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis. Amino acid sequences of TPS coding
genes were aligned using CLUSTAL_X [52]. The alignment
was edited using the program Seaview [53] and it is shown
in the Additional file 2. Phylogenetic reconstructions were
carried out using distance based, parsimony and maximum likelihood methods using the amino acid
sequences. Tree topologies were fairly consistent with the
three methods. The best maximum likelihood tree is
shown in Figure 3 with the bootstrapping values for each
branch. The TPS sequences were clearly grouped in two
major branches: in the first branch are the plant and fungi
proteins. This branch is supported by a very high bootstrapping value. The second group comprises the eubacterial and archaeal proteins; the nematode sequences were
found within this cluster, suggesting a possible lateral
gene transfer event. Insect TPS are in between the two
groups. The majority of the clades are supported by high
bootstrapping values.

The fungi and plant sequences are clearly arranged into
three subgroups: In the first group Arabidopsis AtTPS1 to 4
proteins are clustered with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S.
cerevisiae_1), Eremothecium gossypii (E. gossypii_1),
Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe_1) and Eremothecium.
cuniculi (E. cuniculi). The second group comprises the rest
of the A. thaliana proteins and the five O. sativa TPS proteins. The third group has the S. pombe TPS 2 and 3
(SpTPS2 and 3) proteins and the ScTPS2 and E. gossypii_2
proteins. The last group has the rest of the S. cerevisiae and

E. gossypii_3 TPS proteins. This grouping clearly indicates
that the ancestor of the plant and fungi had at least two
copies of the TPS coding genes, and that there were several
episodes of gene duplication within each species, leading
to gene copies with high degree of sequence similarity.
From the TPS proteins for which functional biochemical
evidence exists, only those in the early branching have TPS
activity (AtTPS1, ScTPS1, SpTPS1).
Within the prokaryotic group there is a clear branch comprising all the proteobacterial species [alphaproteobacteria
(B.
japonicum,
Rhodopseudomonas
palustris,
Sinorhizobium
meliloti),
betaproteobacteria
(R.
solanacearum), gammaproteobacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, X. campestris and Xanthomonas axonopodis)].
The actinobacteria (Mycobacterium and Corynebacterium) and members of Cyanobacteria (Synechocystis sp.
and Synechococcus sp.) phylum are located in a different
branch. The TPS protein tree topology is not consistent
with standard organismal phylogeny. These inconsistencies arise only for genes displaying multiple paralogous
copies in a single organism, suggesting either lateral gene
transfer or differential loss of paralogs. For example X.
campestris has two TPS proteins, X. caspestris_1, which is
grouped with the rest of the gammaproteobacteria, while
the X. caspestris_2 is closely related to Cyanobacteria. M.
loti has also two sequences and it seems that the M. loti_1
protein was also recruited by lateral gene transfer, probably after losing almost half of the native gene which codes
for M. loti_2. The S. coelicolor and Streptomyces avermitilis
TPS were also found apart from the rest of the actinobacteria were they belong. The archaeal TPS are clustered
except for M. thermautotrophicus, which appears to be
more related to actinobacteria of the genus Streptomyces.
Phylogenetic analysis of the TPP proteins
From the completely sequenced genomes we obtained 68
sequences with significant sequence similarity to TPP. The
sequences of the conserved regions corresponding to the
TPP domain were aligned (see Additional file 4), manually edited, and subjected to phylogenetic analyses as
described above for TPS. Trees generated by Neighbour
Joining, Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood were very
similar and Figure 4 shows the best Maximum Likelihood
tree. The bootstrapping values of this tree were not as high
as those obtained for TPS, nevertheless the fact that the
three different phylogenetic reconstruction methods produced similar tree topologies (data not shown) strongly
support the general topology.

The phylogenetic tree clearly displays subgroups between
the previously described TPP classes in A. thaliana: Class I
(AtTPS_1–4), Class II (AtTPS_5–11) and Class III
(AtTPPA-J) [49,54]. The tree also shows that in O. sativa
there are only sequences highly related Class II and III.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/109

Class I and II display a fused TPS domain and seem be
monophyletic with the fungal TPP. As expected, the
branching pattern of both TPS and TPP proteins in this
group of fused polypeptides is highly similar, except for
AtTPS8 that clusters within Class I, perhaps by a gene conversion event with AtTPS3 since these TPP domains are
almost identical. Class III comprises small proteins with
the TPP domain only. This class of proteins probably was
recruited in plants after the divergence from fungi since
they are not present in the latter organisms as single
domain proteins. It is interesting that class III proteins are
closely related to Mycobacterium and it is tempting to speculate that they were recruited from bacteria by an ancestor
of contemporary plants. Interestingly, from the three TPP
classes, only enzymatic activity has been demonstrated for
members of this latter Class (III). For instance, AtTPPA
and AtTPPB complemented a S. cerevisiae tps2 mutant
(which lacks TPP) [55]. However, it cannot be discarded
that some Class I or Class II TPP proteins could have phosphatase activity as well.
The fungal TPP sequences cluster together except E.
cuniculi, and apparently they are closer to plant class I and
II than to bacterial sequences. Archaeal sequences do not
appear as monophyletic. In contrast to bacterial TPS
domains, no TPP domain was found duplicated in any
single bacterial species.
The TPS and TPP trees displayed in Figures 3 and 4 show
similar overall topologies, confirming that there is a high
evolutionary correlation between TPP and TPS domains,
which was suggested by the fusion of both domains in
most of eukaryotic proteins and their clustering in the
prokaryotic genomes (see Additional file 8).
Roles of TPS/TPP homologues in eukaryotes
Why do eukaryotic organisms have several copies of TPS
genes? The synthesis and metabolism of trehalose has
been studied in many different organisms. In S. cerevisiae
there are four proteins with TPS and TPP domains, forming a holoenzyme complex where the ScTPS1 and ScTPS2
subunits have a catalytic function while ScTPS3 and
ScTSL1 have a regulatory role [37]. In A. thaliana the function of the 10 AtTPS1-homologues is unknown [49]. The
finding in the present work that all TPS plant genes (class
I, II and III) are under selection pressure suggests that all
of them have a particular function, which could probably
be related to other processes not necessarily related to
osmoprotection. For instance, some studies concerning
AtTPS7 and AtTPS8 genes from Arabidopsis showed that
they are unable to complement the tps1∆ or tps2∆ mutant
from S. cerevisiae [36] and their products did not have TPS

genes is differentially regulated by glucose: AtTPS1
[25,58]AtTPS8, AtTPS9 and AtTPS10 are repressed,
whereas the expression of AtTPS5 increases significantly
and the rest of the gene-family members remain without
change [59]. It is noteworthy the differential expression of
TPS genes in response to glucose, suggesting an important
role for these genes in the regulation of carbon and sugar
metabolism [60]. Overexpression or mutant analyses of
the TPS genes will uncover their function. In the case of
AtTPS1, the knockout mutant displays an embryo lethal
phenotype, suggesting the role of this gene in plant development [24]. In addition, the overexpression of AtTPS1
shed light on its role as a regulator of glucose, abscisic
acid, and stress signalling [25].
Expression pattern of TPS genes in plants
To gain further understanding of the TPS gene family, the
expression pattern of TPS genes and trehalase (AtTRE1)
from A. thaliana were analyzed during development and
in a tissue-specific manner using the Genevestigator server
[61]. Also, the Meta-Analyzer program was used which is
designed to analyse the expression of a multi-gene family
under different conditions and in different tissues and
growth stages. In Figure 5A the expression levels of AtTPS1
to AtTPS11 and trehalase genes is shown, during the different plant developmental stages. The data showed that
all TPS genes are expressed in the plant in a particular tissue and specific stage. The AtTPS1, AtTPS6, AtTPS7 and
AtTPS11 genes displayed a constitutive expression,
whereas AtTPS2, AtTPS3, AtTPS4 and AtTPS5 are preferentially expressed during senescence. Also, AtTRE1 gene
showed a maximum expression during senescence. Figure
5B shows the overall expression levels of TPS genes and
AtTRE1 in different A. thaliana organs, and led us to classify their expression in groups: 1) AtTPS1, AtTPS6, AtTPS7,
AtTPS8 and AtTPS11 genes which are expressed upon several conditions although their highest level is in flower; 2)
AtTPS2, AtTPS3, AtTPS4 and AtTPS5 genes are expressed
in seeds and at very low levels in the rest of the tissues; and
3) AtTPS9 and AtTPS10 genes expressed mainly in roots.
The expression of AtTRE1 was localized in flowers, particularly in sepals. Thus, it is likely that they have particular
functions during the different plant growth stages.
Trehalose and carbohydrate metabolism
When and how the trehalose metabolism gained extra
functions is uncertain but there are several good examples
of additional roles of trehalose in bacteria, yeast and
plants. In Corynebacterium glutamicum, trehalose is a constitutive part of cell wall [62]. In S. cerevisiae, T6P and
TPS1 have a regulatory role in carbon metabolism, and
trehalose is also and storage carbohydrate [17-20]. It has
been shown that trehalose in plants regulates carbon
metabolism, and signals hormone and stress responses
[25,58]. Nevertheless, sucrose is the most abundant free

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/109

disaccharide in plant cytoplasm, and similarly to trehalose it is a non-reducing disaccharide, which in some
organisms can function as an efficient osmoprotectant
[63].
The synthesis of sucrose is in many aspects similar to trehalose biosynthesis. In a first step sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) forms sucrose-6-phosphate, that is converted
by sucrose phosphatase (SPP) to sucrose. These enzymes
are coded by separated genes in filamentous cyanobacteria (as TPS and TPP in prokaryotes). In plants and some
non-filamentous cyanobacteria, SPS has an SPP-like
domain, but there is also a separate SPP protein, similar to
class III TPP proteins [64,65]. In other, non-filamentous
cyanobacteria there is an SPS without an SPP-like domain
and a separate SPP enzyme. However, in contrast to trehalose, sucrose biosynthesis is practically limited to plants
and cyanobacteria. This enormous difference in distribution between trehalose and sucrose biosynthetic genes
indicates the specialisation of each of these disaccharides.
It has been speculated that sucrose similarly to trehalose,
was initially an osmoprotector, probably in proteobacteria, or in a common ancestor to proteobacteria and cyanobacteria. Later on, it was adopted as a metabolite for
energy and carbon transport in filamentous cyanobaceria
and acquired by eukaryotic cells during the endosymbiosis process from an ancestor able to synthesize sucrose
[63,64]. Only plants among eukaryotes have sucrose
anabolism, suggesting that the ancestral cyanobacterial
endosymbiont that led to the chloroplast must have had
sucrose synthesizing ability that was transferred to the
host [64].
Given that the biosynthesis of trehalose is widely distributed in all domains of life, it is probably much older than
sucrose biosynthesis. However, evolution adopted
sucrose as the main transport and reserve carbohydrate in
plants, leaving trehalose and its intermediate T6P regulatory and signalling roles. One possible explanation for the
higher concentration of sucrose rather than trehalose in
photosynthetic organisms is that the bond energy of
sucrose is 27 kcal/mol whereas for trehalose is -1 kcal/
mol, which makes the former sugar more susceptible for
degradation to obtain energy [66]. Plants have a significantly higher number of enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism than any other organism, and it has
been proposed that gene duplication during evolution of
glycosyl-transferase and glycosyl-hydrolase scaffolds has
allowed their vast specialization [67]. This is probably the
case for TPS multi-gene family in plants, which one of its
products, an ancient osmoprotectant, has derived in other
complex functions related to growth and developmental
control.

Conclusion
We have demonstrated that trehalose biosynthetic pathways are widely distributed in nature. From the five
known pathways to synthesize trehalose, the TPS/TPP
route is the most conserved. Interestingly, several eubacterial species have multiple pathways, while eukaryotes
have only the TPS/TPP pathway. Vertebrates have lost the
capacity to synthesise trehalose but can break it down to
glucose with trehalase. TPS and TPP domains have mainly
evolved in parallel and it is likely that they have experienced several gene duplication and lateral gene transfer
events. Some TPS and TPP sequences studied here lack
functional relevant active site residues. The rate of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution of these proteins indicates that they are under selective pressure and
therefore they must have a function although it is not necessarily osmoprotection. The expression pattern of the 11
AtTPS genes in Arabidopsis shows that they are expressed in
a developmentally programmed and tissue-specific manner, implying a relevant function in cell metabolism.

Methods
Databases
The nucleotide and protein sequences of 205 completely
sequenced genomes were obtained from NCBI and were
explored through their online services.
Preparation of the queries
The strategy to search for related sequences, consisted of
selecting protein sequences from each one of the trehalose
pathways and identify their orthologs in the completely
sequenced genomes. The TPS and TPP domain sequences
were identified and aligned using CLUSTAL_X [52]. The
alignment was manually edited to maintain only conserved regions and deleting non-homologous sequences.
The alignment edition was performed with Seaview program [53].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/109

Phylogenetic tree construction
To estimate the phylogenetic relationships of the
sequences we performed distant based, parsimony, and
maximum likelihood analyses using the Neighbour Joining, Protpars and PHYML programs as implemented in
CLUSTAL_X [52], PHYLIP [68], and PHYML [69] packages, respectively. For each method we performed bootstrapping with 1000 repetitions. The three methods gave
similar clustering. Bootstrapping with 1000 resampling
analyses and the corresponding consensus trees were
obtained using the SEQBOOT and CONSENSE programs
of the PHYLIP package [68].
Gene neighbourhood
To determine the neighbourhood of the genes encoding
TPS and TPP domains, we used the Gene Context Tool
[48].
Rate of codon substitutions
To calculate the rate of codon substitutions, the amino
acid sequences of TPS and TPP alignments were reverse
translated to their DNA sequence using the program JEMBOS 2.7.1 from EMBOS package, afterwards the SLAC
from Datamonkey server and the PAML CODEML program [46] were used to determine the dN-dS values for
each position.
Microarray gene expression analysis
The expression patterns of AtTPS genes were determined
using the Meta-Analizer program from Genevestigator
program [61].
