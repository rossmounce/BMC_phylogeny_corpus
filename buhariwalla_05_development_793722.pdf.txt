Abstract
Background: Chickpea is a major crop in many drier regions of the world where it is an important protein-rich
food and an increasingly valuable traded commodity. The wild annual Cicer species are known to possess unique
sources of resistance to pests and diseases, and tolerance to environmental stresses. However, there has been
limited utilization of these wild species by chickpea breeding programs due to interspecific crossing barriers and
deleterious linkage drag. Molecular genetic diversity analysis may help predict which accessions are most likely to
produce fertile progeny when crossed with chickpea cultivars. While, trait-markers may provide an effective tool
for breaking linkage drag. Although SSR markers are the assay of choice for marker-assisted selection of specific
traits in conventional breeding populations, they may not provide reliable estimates of interspecific diversity, and
may lose selective power in backcross programs based on interspecific introgressions. Thus, we have pursued the
development of gene-based markers to resolve these problems and to provide candidate gene markers for QTL
mapping of important agronomic traits.
Results: An EST library was constructed after subtractive suppressive hybridization (SSH) of root tissue from
two very closely related chickpea genotypes (Cicer arietinum). A total of 106 EST-based markers were designed
from 477 sequences with functional annotations and these were tested on C. arietinum. Forty-four EST markers
were polymorphic when screened across nine Cicer species (including the cultigen). Parsimony and PCoA analysis
of the resultant EST-marker dataset indicated that most accessions cluster in accordance with the previously
defined classification of primary (C. arietinum, C. echinospermum and C. reticulatum), secondary (C. pinnatifidum, C.
bijugum and C. judaicum), and tertiary (C. yamashitae, C. chrossanicum and C. cuneatum) gene-pools. A large
proportion of EST alleles (45%) were only present in one or two of the accessions tested whilst the others were
represented in up to twelve of the accessions tested.
Conclusion: Gene-based markers have proven to be effective tools for diversity analysis in Cicer and EST
diversity analysis may be useful in identifying promising candidates for interspecific hybridization programs. The
EST markers generated in this study have detected high levels of polymorphism amongst both common and rare
alleles. This suggests that they would be useful for allele-mining of germplasm collections for identification of
candidate accessions in the search for new sources of resistance to pests / diseases, and tolerance to abiotic
stresses.

Background
Chickpea (Cicer arietium L.) is one of the world's more
important but less studied leguminous food crop with
over 10 M ha grown across the Americas, the Mediterranean basin, East Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Australia
[1]. As a grain legume it plays a significant role in the
nutrition of the rural and urban poor in the developing
world, as it provides a protein-rich supplement to cerealbased diets particularly of vegetarians and subsistence
farmers who cannot afford meat. Despite its economic
importance, chickpea productivity has been low because
of yield losses to foliar and soil-borne fungal diseases
(ascochyta blight, fusarium wilt and botrytis grey mould),
insect pests (helicoverpapod borer) and abiotic stresses
such as drought, cold and salinity. Sources of resistance
and tolerance to these constraints exist in the wild Cicer
germplasm yet remain largely unused by conventional
breeding programs [2-5]. Three annual Cicer gene-pools
have been defined based on the available hybridization
reports, biochemical and molecular diversity analysis [6]:
species within the primary gene-pool (C. arietinum, C.
reticulatum and C. echinospermum) can be readily crossed
usually generating fully fertile progeny; while species
within the secondary gene-pool (C. bijugum, C. pinnatifidum and C. judaicum) can be successfully crossed with the
cultigen C. arietinum, providing hybrid embryos are rescued. However, the progeny of crosses between primary
and second gene-pools are frequently sterile; finally, species within the tertiary gene-pool (C. cuneatum, C. chorassanicum, C. yamashitae and others) have not yet been
successfully crossed with the cultigen Cicer arietinum.
Cultivated chickpea has a relatively low level of diversity,
due to a series of bottlenecks caused by restricted distribution of the wild progenitors and the founder effect associated with domestication [7]. In addition, chickpea
breeding programs have limited themselves to a small
number of cultivated genotypes having sources of biotic
stress resistance and abiotic stress tolerance with little or
no use of wild species [5]. This has resulted in limited
durability of resistances to many of the major pests and
diseases, and limited progress in abiotic stress tolerance
breeding. Wild germplasm accessions held at the International Centre for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas
(ICARDA) in Syria, the International Institute for the
Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in India and other
genebanks in USA, Europe and Australia contain valuable
sources of novel genetic variation for improvement of
these traits [6]. The wild Cicer species from the secondary
gene-pool (particularly C. bijugum, C. pinnatifidum and C.
judaicum) are known to possess multiple sources of pest
and disease resistance and tolerance to abiotic stresses
including drought and cold [7,8].

Where species barriers can be overcome, molecular markers will facilitate rapid and efficient transfer of economically important traits into cultivated breeding pools. This
will have the added advantage of broadening the narrow
genetic base of this crop and thereby reducing its vulnerability to evolving pest and disease pressures, while simultaneously providing stable increases in yield far beyond
the current 0.6% annual improvement [1].
Most types of molecular markers have been tested in
chickpea including isozymes [9-12], restriction fragment
length polymorphism (RFLP) [13,14] random amplified
polymorphic DNA markers (RAPDs) [15,16] amplified
fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) [17], sequence
characterized amplified regions (SCARs) [18], inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSRs) [15], simple sequence repeat
(STMS or SSR) [19-22], resistance gene analogs (RGAs)
[23] DNA amplification fingerprinting (DAF) [24], and
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) [25]. However, there is a
low level of polymorphism detected in cultivated chickpea using isozyme/allozyme markers [9,10] and RFLP
analysis [13,14]. In contrast, SSR markers have been
shown to be highly polymorphic within the cultigen C.
arietinum [26] and have been routinely utilized for creating genetic linkage maps [27-29]. These SSR markers have
also been used as reference points for integration of the
different chickpea linkage groups derived from inter- and
intra- specific crosses [28,29]. To date there are over 500
SSR markers developed from chickpea genomic libraries
[19,20,22]. In general, 30–50% of the chickpea SSR markers are polymorphic in any given breeding or intra-specific
mapping population (HK Buhariwalla, unpublished
data).
SSR markers remain the marker of choice for marker
assisted selection in many breeding programs. However,
SSR motifs may evolve too rapidly to be valuable as the
sole assay for interspecific diversity analysis. In addition,
markers shown to have tight genetic linkage to target
genes in interspecific mapping populations may lose their
selective power when used in backcross programs based
on interspecific derivatives. Thus, there is a need for the
development and utilization of gene-based markers that
better serve molecular breeding applications and diversity
analysis of germplasm.
In this context, the most important criteria for new markers are high reproducibility, detection of co-dominance
polymorphism and suitability for rapid large-scale low
cost screening. EST-based markers fulfill these criteria and
since they are associated with the coding regions of the
genome they also enhance molecular germplasm evaluation by capturing variation across transcribed regions and
in genes of known function. This potentially resolves the
problem of limited genomic coverage suffered by

traditional single gene phylogenetic studies [30,31]. Targeted EST development has already begun in chickpea,
focusing on ABA-related mechanisms of water-deficit tolerance in epicotyl tissue [32].
Our objective in this study was to increase the public EST
resource for chickpea with a particular focus on root tissue, as constitutive drought tolerance mechanisms (such
as root system development) are a common target for the
crop physiology community [33] and are increasingly

identified by genomics studies as important components
of stress tolerance mechanisms [32,34]. Thus, an EST
library was constructed after SSH of root tissue from two
very closely related chickpea (C. arietinum) genotypes the
landrace ICC 4958 and the popular local variety Annigeri,
both considered to possess important sources of drought
tolerance [35,36]. Following sequencing and functional
annotation, we have generated over 100 EST markers
which we have used in preliminary diversity analysis of
wild and cultivated Cicer germplasm.

Results and discussion
The SSH process resulted in over 4000 clones expected to
be largely associated with ICC 4958 (SSH tester) but could
conceivably also include some highly constitutively
expressed genes from Annigeri (SSH driver). Typically the
cDNA inserts ranged from 0.5–1 kb. All clones were partially or fully sequenced through a single pass read from
the 3' end and trimmed of vector and low quality
sequences. A length threshold of 170 bp was set in view of
the minimum expected size of a functional gene-encoding
region (exon) [37]. Removal of short sequences (below
170 bp: largely comprising of problematic repeats and
sequences predominantly composed of poly-A) resulted
in 2858 high quality EST sequences with an average length
of 480 bp all available at the ICRISAT Chickpea EST Database [38].
Analysis of ESTs and assembly of consensus sequences
Gene annotations were based on similarities to either
known or putative ESTs in the public databases. All annotations were based on Blast searches, with a score threshold of ≥ 200 for BLASTn. For tBLASTx a score threshold of
>100 was set, as these generally had e-values <10-5 with a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/5/16

minimum of 50% identity over at least 30% of the length
of the protein, which are the commonly used thresholds
for reliable sequence annotation [39,40]. Tentative functional annotations of EST sequences based on tBLASTx
were grouped under 12 general categories based on the
biochemical functions of the predicted proteins (Figure
1). The 2858 sequences were assembled into 210 contigs
with 267 ESTs remaining unassociated (singletons). Putative identifications could be assigned to 2179 of the 2858
sequences (76%), representing 73% of the unigenes (178
singletons and 162 contigs), and all of these proteins were
represented in other plant species. The 2858 sequences
were assembled into 210 contigs with 267 ESTs remaining
unassociated (singletons). Assuming that in most cases
each contig represents one gene [41] a maximum number
of 477 genes are represented in this dataset (available at
NCBI: accession numbers CK148643–CK149150). The
total length of contigs ranged from 240 to 1291 bases
(with an average of 648 bases) while the largest number
of ESTs assembled into one contig was 255. EST assembly
leading to the generation of tentative consensus (TC)
sequences has dramatically reduced the redundancy in
this database, as reported elsewhere [42] (see Additional
file 1).
Over three quarters of the 210 consensus sequences (77%
equivalent to 164 contigs) were found to have significant
similarity (tBLASTx >100) to sequences in public databases. Many of these annotations (47 consensus
sequences) were validated through comparison with the
CDD database using RPS-BLAST which compares a protein query sequence to a position-specific score matrix
prepared from the underlying conserved protein domain
alignment [43]. Conserved motifs consistent with
tBLASTx annotations were identified in 47 consensus
sequences providing an additional level of confidence for
these assigned gene functions (see Additional file 2).
As expected, we observed a substantial number of the EST
contigs and singletons to have no significant homology
(NSH: 48 contigs and 89 singletons; 29%) to either nucleotide or protein sequences in public databases at the time
of analysis. This compares well to the higher proportion
of sequences (44%) reported with little or no homology
from chickpea leaf tissue [44]. In addition, a substantial
number of ESTs (approximately 19% of the unigenes)
were found to have similarity with unannotated hypothetical, putative or unknown proteins contained in the public databases and were, therefore, placed in the
unidentified function (UF) class.
PCR optimisation and unit costs
Optimization of PCR conditions is a critical precursor for
accurate and robust large-scale marker screening and
offers additional benefits for reducing the unit cost of gen-

otyping [45]. As optimization relies on the sequential
investigation of each reaction variable, the process can
take a long time, thus the conditions of optimization are
rarely identified empirically and individual components
are rarely all tested simultaneously. However, Cobb and
Clarkson [46] devised a strategy in which the components
of a PCR reaction could be tested together using the least
number ofexperiments based on the Taguchi principle
[47]. We adapted the Cobb and Clarkson [46], 9 reactions
of 4 PCR components to a 5 reactions of 5 PCR components, the additional component being enzyme
concentration. This further reduced the time and cost of
optimization, whilst also minimizing the cost of the PCR
screening by also considering enzyme concentration.
Final primer (0.15 - 0.5 pmol) and Taq DNA polymerase
(0.2 – 0.5 U) concentrations resulted in a reagent unit cost
of US$0.08 per PCR sample. This compares very favorable
with other reports of PCR unit costs [48,49]. Clearly DNA
extraction costs are an equally important component for
molecular breeding programs and can also be greatly
reduced as has been reported elsewhere [50]. The primer
sequences and optimization parameters of all the polymorphic markers are given in Table 2. Optimization also
resulted in fewer spurious amplification products and
clearer polymorphic bands amongst the accessions studied (Figure 2).
EST marker diversity analysis
A total of 106 EST primers were designed, optimized and
screened, of which 48 gave good amplification products
in ICC 4958 (the SSH tester accession in the EST
generation process) while 58 were deemed unsuitable as
they either did not produce an amplification product or
generated a complex pattern of bands which were difficult
to evaluate. Of the 48 primers pairs screened across 1 cul-

tivated and 8 wild Cicer species, 44 were polymorphic
(Table 2). A total of 167 polymorphic fragments ranging
in size from 200 to >1000 bp was scored on polyacrylamide or agarose electrophoresis gels depending on product size (Figure 2). The number of alleles detected per
primer ranged from 2 – 8 with the polymorphic information content (PIC) ranging 0.03 – 0.89 (Table 5).
Fourteen of the 106 EST's contained SSR motifs, of which
10 contained perfect trinucleotide repeats. A relatively
large proportion of these EST-SSR markers (8) were
derived from the no significant homology (NSH) and
unknown protein functional (UF) classes, based on
sequence comparisons (BLASTn tBLASTx and PSI-BLAST).
Markers from these EST classes have readily detected polymorphism in the diverse germplasm tested (PIC 0.20–
0.82). Since over 48% of the EST's generated from the
chickpea root library fall into NSH and UF classes, these
are clearly useful markers with potentially important, yet
unknown functions.
Eleven of the polymorphic EST's were from stress annotated transcripts (AGLC2, AGLC16, AGLC 20, AGLC29,
AGLC 34, AGLC45, AGLC52, AGLC53, AGLC55,
AGLC66, AGLC68 and AGLC93); of these four contained
SSR motifs (AGLC 34, AGLC55, AGLC67 and AGLC84).
These stress related EST markers may be useful for allelemining of germplasm collections for the identification of
candidate accessions with new sources of agronomically
important traits and for candidate gene mapping [51].
The EST data-set generated in this study was used to compute pair-wise genetic distances between species
according to Band similarity coefficient and UPGMA clustering. In order to display, with minimal distortion, the

most parsimonious tree with 301 steps (Figure 4) corresponding well with the PCoA analysis.
Both PCoA and parsimony analysis provide clear separation of most species. Both analysis grouped C. echinospermum, C. reticulatum and C. arietinum, together. These three

lectively referred to as the tertiary gene pool (Figure 3 and
Figure 4) from which no viable hybrids have been
reported from crosses with the cultigen.
Parsimony analysis grouped C. chorassanicum with C.
cuneatum, but placed the C. yamashitae accessions as outliers (Figure 4). This data supports the tertiary group proposed by Croser et al. [6] to consist of; C. chorassanicum
which has never been successfully crossed with cultivated
chickpea and C. yamashitae and C. cuneatum which have
been crossed with the cultigen but the resultant progeny
have failed to flower or proven sterile. However, this is not
reflected in the PCoA (Figure 3).

species are classified together as the primary gene pool
based on crossability studies. Similarly, all previous diversity studies based on allozymes [52], RAPD [16,53], microsatellite [54], ISSR [15,55] and AFLP [17] markers have
also grouped C. echinospermum, C. reticulatum and C. arietinum together. The EST-based diversity analysis presented here shows C. arietinum (believed to be the wild
annual progenitor [56] of cultivated chickpea) to be
slightly distant to C. echinospermum and C. reticulatum but
still within the same cluster (best reflected by the PCoA
analysis Figure 3). All previous molecular diversity studies
have clustered C. bijugum, C. pinnatifidum and C. judaicum
together, although sometimes not well differentiated
from the primary gene-pool species based on molecular
diversity analysis. These three species are commonly considered to represent the secondary gene-pool as they
require embryo rescue to recover viable progeny when
crossed with the cultigen [6]. Both parsimony and PCoA
analyses of the EST data-set clustered C. judaicum, C. pinnatifidum and C. bijugum together. This is in agreement
with previous studies which demonstrated the close association of these three species. The current analysis suggests
that C. pinnatifidum and C. judaicum are more closely
related. This is in agreement with previous reports based
on morphology analysis [56], seed storage protein analysis [57] and isozyme analysis [12]. In contrast, ecogeographical studies of the wild Cicer germplasm have
suggested that C. judaicum to be quite diverged [7], which
may explain the outlying position of one C. judaicum
accession studied here (IG 69986) (Figure 4). Most other
species generally fall into one of two clusters generally col-

The distribution of accessions from the same species
within secondary and tertiary clusters suggests that these
two gene-pools may not be as distinct as previously
expected. This may indicate that there are some tertiary
gene-pool species that might be more readily crossed with
the cultigen than their taxonomic classification would
otherwise indicate. However, since the current study is
based on a limited numbers of accessions for both C.
cuneatum and C. yamashitae further research is required to
fully define the relationships between these species and
the scope of new opportunities for plant breeders.

Conclusion
This is the first report of the use of EST-based markers for
estimating genetic distances between annual Cicer species.
We report on the development and characterization of
106 EST markers from chickpea sequences with functional
annotations or unknown functions, some of which contain SSR motifs. These markers have detected high levels
of polymorphism amongst the wild species studied here
and initial results indicate that around 20% are polymorphic in intraspecific (C. arietinum) mapping populations,
either directly or as cleaved amplified polymorphic
sequences (CAPS) based markers [58].
The EST marker-based diversity analysis reported here
broadly supports the Cicer taxonomy based on allozymic
data and conclusions by Croser et al. [6]. The concurrence
of our EST data with that of allozymic studies in particular
suggests that many gene-based loci do have a common
ancestory across Cicer species, as proposed but not substantiated by Choumane et al. [54]. Clustering patterns
based on RAPD, AFLP and ISSR are generally very similar
[15,17,55] but are substantially different to those based
on the EST marker analysis reported here and the previously reported allozyme-based analyses [59]. This may be
a consequence of RAPD, AFLP and ISSR markers sampling
fundamentally different regions of the genome (under different evolutionary pressures) as compared with markers
based on expressed genes. Unfortunately a detailed
comparison of different assays is confounded by the vir-

tual absence of common accessions and the adoption of
different statistical analyses in each study [6].
The EST database developed in this study provides a preliminary profile of some differentially expressed genes
that may be associated with constitutive mechanisms
important for stress tolerance and root development in
chickpea roots. These include transcripts with putative
annotations for proteases, T6P synthase, non-specific
lipid transfer proteins, MRP-like ABC transporters, chaperones- HSP70, TCP-1-alpha, bZIP transcription factor,
calcium ATPases, protein kinases, MRP4 glutathione-conjugate transporter, glutathione S-transferase, phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase, S-adenosyl methionine
synthetase (see Additional files 1 and 2 for full details). It
is envisaged that these differentially expressed genes can
be validated by the chickpea community and the most
promising ESTs used in candidate gene mapping and
allele mining. The resultant annotated EST markers will
then be of substantial value for marker-assisted introgression programs based on interspecific crosses using wild
Cicer species that harbour agronomically valuable genes.

One of the aims of chickpea breeding is to address the
continuing need for cultivars adapted to particular geographical regions or with specific new ideotypes to ensure
sustainability and profitability of production. An important means of continuing to achieve such breeding objectives is through the use of novel germplasm [60]. Many
breeding programs, in particular those involving rice and
wheat, have successfully utilized molecular and statistical
approaches in accelerating the introduction of novel
genes from wild species through marker accelerated backcross breeding.
The availability of increasing amounts of sequence data in
many legume species now offers the potential for routine
development of gene-based markers. These provide the
ultimate assay (or so-called 'perfect marker') for indirect
trait selection and map-based cloning. Combining genebased markers together with highly polymorphic flanking
SSR markers will greatly assist in reducing linkage drag
and increasing the speed and efficiency of subsequent
introgression programs. Finally, molecular genetic diversity analysis based on EST markers may also provide a

means of predicting which accessions are most likely to

cultivars.

Annigeri using Trizol reagents (GIBCO-BRL) for RNA isolation, mRNA was purified using Oligotex (Qiagen
GmbH, Hilden, Germany).

Methods

The suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) process
was carried out using a Clontech PCR-Select cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech INC. USA). Tester (ICC 4958) and
driver (Annigeri) cDNA was restricted with RsaI for 90
mins and cDNA from the ICC 4958 was ligated with the
required adaptors. Adaptor ligation was confirmed by
PCR, followed by one round of over-night hybridisation
with Annigeri as the driver and ICC 4958 as the tester. A
second round of hybridisation was followed by primary
PCR (27 cycles) and secondary PCR (12 cycles) according
to the manufacturer's instructions for the PCR-Select. The
PCR products of the subtraction were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and cloned using pCR4-TOPO cloning kit
(Invitrogen Inc., USA). The cDNA clones were amplified
in E. coli DH10B cells by electroporation and insert containing clones were selected by plating on LB agar containing 100 ug/ml ampicillin. Large colony forms were picked
and used to regenerate single clone cultures in 96-well
microtitre plates. After growth over-night at 37°C, glycerol was added to a final concentration of 15% and cultures were stored at -80°C.

Plant material and growth conditions for SSH
Fifteen seeds from each chickpea accession (ICC 4958 and
Annigeri) were sterilized with 25% chlorex (v/v) for 10
mins, rinsed twice with sterile distilled water, before placing in pre-sterilized plant pots containing sterilized
vertisol. The soil was collected from the field, passed
through a 2 mm sieve and autoclaved in plastic bags using
a 60 min cycle at 120°C and repeated three times on
consecutive days. Seeds were sown immediately after the
last autoclave cycle.

Three seeds were sown per pot; the plants were maintained in a Conviron growth chamber (Conviron, Winnipeg, Man.) under optimal physiological conditions for
chickpea growth: 25°C day (11 h) and 12°C night (13 h),
455 µmoles m-2 sec-1 illumination intensity, 80% day and
40% night relative humidity, and irrigation as required.
Roots were harvested 28 days after germination (with
flowering expected after 30 days). The soil was washed off
the roots in running water, the intact whole plant was
lifted out of the soil and soil particles were gently rubbed
off in running water with gloved hands. The root tissue
was subsequently treated with (0.1% v/v) DEPC solution
and immersed in sterile Milli Q water, excess water from
the roots was blotted onto filter paper and roots were
weighed (approx. 2 g), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at -80°C.
RNA isolation and suppressed subtractive hybridization
The subtraction of the two genomes was achieved through
a process of PCR-based suppression of genes common to
both genotypes, and genes that are differentially expressed
are enriched. As the process is based on PCR, low copy
number cDNA can be detected from the tester (ICC 4958).
RNA isolation and library construction was carried out by
Avestha Gengraine Technologies (Bangalore, India). Total
RNA was isolated from the root tissue of ICC 4958 and

EST sequencing
Cultures of transformed E. coli were grown over-night in
100 ul LB media containing 100 ug/ml ampicillin, the
cells were centrifuged and suspended in sterile distilled
water, heat denatured for 10 mins at 95°C, 1 ul of supernatant was used for insert amplification with M13 forward and reverse primers. Inserts (5 ul) were separated by
electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gel containing ethidium
bromide to confirm amplification of a single insert and
for quantification. After SAP/exonuclease I digest, 4 ul of
the insert was sequenced using T7 primer and 1/8 fraction
of the recommended volume of dye terminator reagent
(Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing kit v2, ABI-Foster
City) for cycle sequencing. After removal of dye blobs by
ethanol precipitation, DNA sequences were analyzed by
capillary-electrophoresis using an Applied Biosystems
genetic analyzer model ABI 3700 or ABI 3100.

Sequence analysis for predicting gene function
Base calling was performed using the ABI DNA Sequence
Analysis Software (v3.7) or by Chromas v2.2 (Technelysium Pty Ltd. Australia). All sequences were scanned visually for quality of the peak shapes and corresponding base
call. Vector sequences were trimmed using Sequencher v.4
(Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI) software and low quality
bases (quality score <20) were trimmed from both ends of
sequences. A total of 4000 sequences were analyzed, only
sequences of more than 170 bp with less than 5% ambiguity were processed. All sequences containing interspersed or simple repeats were masked with the
RepeatMasker software [61] using Arabidoposis as reference. The masked sequences were screened against the following DNA databases: Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago
truncatula, Glycine max, Zea mays and Oryza sativa, in the
TIGR Gene Indices using default settings for BLASTn and
tBLASTx searches [62]. The same sequences were also used
to search the NCBI EST database (dbEST) using Viridiplantae as a limiter [63].

The comparison of chickpea sequences with those in public databases was carried out during 2002 – 2003, and
blast searches with unique sequences were repeated in
November 2004. An in-house script was used to retrieve
best matches from the outputs of BLASTn and tBLASTx
text files, retaining the following information: gene
identifier, description, BLAST score, percent identity,
alignment length, reading frame, and database name from
the top-scoring alignments. Alignments with scores of
≥200 for BLASTn and ≥100 for tBLASTx were extracted
into an MS-Access table. The individual ESTs were assembled into tentative consensus sequences (TCs) using
Sequencher, the assembly parameters used for 'dirty data'
were (minimum percentage match of 90 and minimum
overlap 40 bp). A sequence was retained in a contig if it
matched at least one sequence already in the contig based
on pair-wise BLAST [63], with a percentage identity
threshold of 90%. A consensus sequence was then derived
for each cluster. Consensus sequences were translated into
six possible reading frames with Transeq software [64],
using the standard genetic code. The translated sequences
were then submitted to Reverse Position Specific (RPS)BLAST [63] to search for matches to the conserved domain
database (CDD; all 4540-PSSMs) using default parameters. The RPS-BLAST outputs were similarly processed
using an in-house script, retaining the following information from the top-scoring alignments: gene identifier,
description, score and e-value. Each result was manually
interpreted and classified according to the biochemical
function of the predicted protein.
Plant material and DNA isolation
Fifteen chickpea accessions representing 9 annual Cicer
species, including the cultivated species C. arietinum, were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/5/16

used in this study (Table 1). Seeds of these accessions were
germinated in Jiffy pots in a growth room and DNA was
extracted from 4–5 pinnules of 15–20 day old individual
plants with 2% CTAB extraction buffer containing 0.03%
mercaptoethanol as described in [50]. DNA concentrations were determined by comparing the sample intensity
(1 µl) with that of known amounts of uncut lambda DNA
by electrophoresis in 1.2% 'Ready-to-run' agarose gels
(Amersham) containing ethidium bromide. DNA was
diluted to a working stock concentration of 10 ng/µl and
checked before use.
Primer design of EST markers
A total of 106 EST sequences were chosen that represented
diverse functional/stress annotations, a selection of which
contained SSR motifs. In addition, primers were also
designed from a random selection of sequences categorized as having 'no significant homology' (NSH) and
'unknown protein function' (UF) when compared with
either nucleotide or protein sequences in public
databases.

Primer sequences were designed using Genefisher 1.1
software [65] using the following criteria 57 – 63°C melting temperature (Tm), 40–50% GC content, 17–24 bp
primer length and the difference in Tm between forward
and reverse primer pairs was limited to 2°C. For those EST
sequences containing repeat motifs, primers were
designed to flank the microsatellite region. Optimal
primer pairs were selected using Netprimer, the primer
design algorithm which analyzes all possible secondary
structures including hairpins, self-dimers and cross-dimers [66]. The Tm and product length of 8 forward and
reverse pairs per sequence from Genefisher software were
evaluated by Netprimer software for minimal or no secondary structure. All primer and EST sequences are accessible through the ICRISAT Chickpea EST Database [38].
PCR optimization and evaluation
The chickpea accession ICC 4958 (from which the EST
sequences were derived) was used as the reference accession for primer optimization. A total of 106 EST primers
(synthesized by MWG, Germany) were optimized simultaneously for the following PCR components using a
modified (5×5) grid [46]. On this basis initial optimization of the five major components in a PCR (concentrations of primer, template DNA, Mg++, dNTP and enzyme)
were empirically determined for each primer used in this
study (Table 3). Optimal touch-down temperature and
number of amplification cycle profiles were also determined for each primer pair (Table 4). This procedure is
important to minimize non-specific amplification, maximize data accuracy and minimizes cost.

PCRs were performed in a total volume of 5 µl containing
5–10 ng of DNA and optimized concentration of the following: primer (0.15–0.3 pmoles), dNTP (0.1–0.2 mM),
MgCl2 (1.5–2 mM), Qiagen Taq (0.2–0.5 u) and 1 x
buffer. PCR amplifications were carried out using a GeneAmp model 9700 thermocycler (Perkin Elmer-Applied
Biosystems). As the annealing temperatures of the markers ranged from 47–65°C we opted to use 3 catagories of
"touchdown" temperature cycles (see Table 4).
PCR amplified products with a size range of 200–600 bp
were resolved by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels
electrophoresis (6–10% acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 20:1
in TBE). Bands were visualized through a modified silver
staining protocol [67] as follows: gels were immersed in
water for 3 mins, followed by 20 mins in 0.1% CTAB solution and 0.3% ammonia solution for 15 mins. Silver
staining solution was freshly prepared each day, consisting of 0.1 % (w/v) AgNO3 in 4 mM NaOH solution, 0.5 to
0.6 ml of 25% ammonia was titrated until the cloudy suspension became clear. Gels were gently agitated in the silver nitrate solution for 30 mins, and developed in 1.5%
(w/v) sodium carbonate and 0.02% (v/v) formamide

water, fixed in 1.5% glycerol solution and documented by
scanning. PCR products above 600 bp were resolved by
agarose gels electrophoresis (0.8–1%) containing ethidium bromide.
EST marker data collection and analysis
The amplification profile from each EST marker was
checked for reproducibility and subsequently scored visually (and independently rescored) for the presence (1) or
absence (0) of polymorphic bands. The degree of polymorphism was quantified using the polymorphic information content (PIC) calculator [68] based on the
following formula:

PIC = 1 - ∑ Pi2 - ∑ ∑ Pi2Pj2
i = 1 i = 1 j = i+1
where Pi is the frequency of an individual genotype.
Pair-wise genetic distances were calculated with NTSYS-pc
software version 2.0 [69] as Sxy = 1 - (2nxy/nx + ny) as Sxy =
