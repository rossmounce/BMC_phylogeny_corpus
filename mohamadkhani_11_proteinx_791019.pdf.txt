Abstract
Background: Even though many functions of protein-x from the Hepatitis B virus
(HBV) have been revealed, the nature of protein-x is yet unknown. This protein is
well-known for its transactivation activity through interaction with several cellular
transcription factors, it is also known as an oncogene. In this work, we have
presented computational approaches to design a model to show the structure of
protein-x and its respective binding sites associated with the CCAAT/enhancerbinding protein a (C/EBPa). C/EBPa belongs to the bZip family of transcription
factors, which activates transcription of several genes through its binding sites in liver
and fat cells. The C/EBPa has been shown to bind and modulate enhancer I and the
enhancer II/core promoter of HBV. In this study using the bioinformatics tools we
tried to present a reliable model for the protein-x interaction with C/EBPa.
Results: The amino acid sequence of protein-x was extracted from UniProt [UniProt:
Q80IU5] and the x-ray crystal structure of the partial CCAAT-enhancer a [PDB:1NWQ]
was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Similarity search for protein-x was
carried out by psi-blast and bl2seq using NCBI [GenBank: BAC65106.1] and Local
Meta-Threading-Server (LOMETS) was used as a threading server for determining the
maximum tertiary structure similarities. Advanced MODELLER was implemented to
design a comparative model, however, due to the lack of a suitable template, Quark
was used for ab initio tertiary structure prediction.
The PDB-blast search indicated a maximum of 23% sequence identity and 33%
similarity with crystal structure of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome
virus leader protease Nsp1a [PDB:3IFU]. This meant that protein-x does not have a
suitable template to predict its tertiary structure using comparative modeling tools,
therefore we used QUARK as an ab initio 3D prediction approach. Docking results
from the ab initio tertiary structure of protein-x and crystal structure of the C/EBPaDNA region [PDB:1NWQ] illustrated the protein-binding site interactions. Indeed, the
N-terminal part of 1NWQ has a high affinity for certain regions in protein-x (e.g. from
Ala76 to Ser101 and Thr105 to Glu125).
Conclusion: In this study, we predicted the structure of protein-x of HBV in interaction
with C/EBPa. The docking results showed that protein-x has an interaction synergy
with C/EBPa. However, despite previous experimental data, protein-x was found to
interact with DNA. This can lead to a better understanding of the function of protein-x
and may provide an opportunity to use it as a therapeutic target.

Background
Human beings are the natural hosts for the hepatitis B virus (HBV), which infects
approximately 350 million individuals worldwide each year. The 3.2-kb long viral genome is partially double stranded and contains four identified open reading frames
(ORFs). The ORFx encodes the 154 amino acids of protein-x with a molecular mass of
17.5 kDa, which has not been found in mature virions and is not accompanied by a
nucleocapsid particle [1,2]. The hepatocarcinogenesis of the hepatitis B virus in association with protein-x has been studied further in recent years [3]. However, the 3D structure of protein-x is currently unknown, and hence specific functions of this protein are
not well understood. Protein-x has no counterparts in any of its hosts and is conserved
among mammalian hepadnavirus [1]. Although the mechanism by which this protein
mediates hepatocellular carcinogenesis is not yet understood, it is known that it is a
multifunctional regulator that transactivates viral and host genes through a variety of
promoters [4]. Researchers have shown that this protein is not a DNA binding molecule,
and that it is therefore, not a typical transactivator [5]. Most promoters which are activated by protein-x attach to the transcription factors belonging to the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family. The In vitro interaction assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assays
have shown that protein-x increases the DNA binding activity of the CCAAT/enhancerbinding protein a (C/EBPa) through direct interaction with the enhancer [6-9]. The
C/EBPa is expressed mainly in highly differentiated cells such as liver and fat cells
[10,11]. Domain analysis of protein-x indicates that the central region (amino acids 78103) is necessary for a direct interaction with C/EBPa [12]. However, the complete form
of protein-x is necessary for the synergistic activation of the HBV pregenomic promoter
which suggests that the interaction of protein-x with C/EBPa enhances the transcription
of the HBV pregenomic promoter, leading to the effective life cycle of HBV in hepatocytes [7,12].
Experimentally, protein-x has defied x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance [5]. Since no 3D structure of the protein is available, determination of the secondary
structure and tertiary structures of protein-x can be regarded as an interesting area of
research in order to elucidate its function [13]. Here, we have sought to define a structural
model for protein-x and describe its interaction with the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein a (C/EBPa) using computational methods. The prediction of the tertiary structure of
protein-x could have valuable applications, such as the possibility of controlling the cellular transactivating function and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. This can
also have an impact on the HBV life cycle in hepatocytes induced via this protein. The
protein as a whole may act as an excellent target for designing specific drugs to treat HBV
infection.
Methods
Data sets

The sequences in this study were retrieved from the public databases: National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ [14]; EBI (The
European Bioinformatics Institute) http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ [15] and UniProt/ExPASy
(Swiss Bioinformatics Resource) http://expasy.org/tools/ [16]. The protein-x [UniProt:
P0C681] and its deduced amino acid sequence was retrieved from the UniProt database

Page 2 of 9

Mohamadkhani et al. Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling 2011, 8:41
http://www.tbiomed.com/content/8/1/41

and the x-ray crystallography of the partial CCAAT-enhancer a [PDB:1NWQ] was
retrieved from The Protein Data bank (PDB) http://www.rcsb.org/pdb [17].
Similarity and multiple alignments

HBx [PDB:P0C681] was used to conduct similarity search against the UniProt data
base [18] using blastp algorithm. Protein sequences were aligned using Clustal-X [19]
and Jalview [20], and analyzed using GeneDoc http://www.nrbsc.org/gfx/genedoc/ [21].
LOMETS, threading results were used for identifying similarity between protein-x and
the crystallized structure PDB.
Amino acid analysis

MEGA software was used for the amino acid sequence analysis, this software has been
developed to use molecular biology data for estimating evolutionary distances, reconstructing phylogenetic trees and computing basic statistical quantities, such as nucleotide and amino acid frequencies, transition/transversion bases, codon frequencies
(codon usage tables), and the number of variable sites in specified segments of the
amino acid sequences [22]. PROSITE http://prosite.expasy.org/ was searched for protein-x motif contents [23] and the DiANNA 1.1 web server was used to predict the
disulfide bond topology, the server is available at http://cassandra.dsi.unifi.it [24].
Tertiary structure modeling and Validation

The LOMETS is an on-line web service for protein structure prediction [25], it generates tertiary structures by collecting high-scoring target-to-template alignments from 8
locally-installed threading programs (FUGUE, HHsearch, MUSTER, PPA, PROSPECT2,
SAM-T02, SPARKS, SP3). LOMETS can easily find the best 10 threading models
selected from 160 models by the confidence score. It also selects the top 10 targettemplate alignments of individual threading servers and full-length models built by
MODELLER http://cassandra.dsi.unifi.it [26].
Modeller as a restrained-based modeling structure begins with an alignment of the
sequence to be modeled (target) with a related known 3D structure (template). In this
study, the align2d function of the MODELLER program was used to align protein-x
sequence with the sequence of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus
leader protease Nsp1a [PDB:3IFU] as template (the target-template alignment was used to
build the model by satisfaction of spatial restraints). The initial model was then refined
(eight times) using the loop-refine program. QUARK was used for as ab initio folding and
structure prediction of small proteins that predicted the 3D model only from amino acid
sequences http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/QUARK/. The NIH’s Laboratory for
Structural Genomics and Proteomics procheck [27] and verify-3D [26] was carried out to
evaluate the tertiary structure predicted. Protein structure illustrations were generated
with the PyMOL Molecular Graphics Software [28].
Docking

The binding sites of the C/EBPa that interact with protein-x were docked using several
docking software’s and the results were compared with each other. The docking servers
included the Z-dock which has implemented the fast Fourier transform to search and
evaluate all possible binding modes based on shape complementary, de-solvation

energy and electrostatics http://zdock.bu.edu/; the PatchDock Molecular docking
algorithm was based on shape complementary principles to evaluate suitable binding
positions using FireDock [29], Hex http://www.loria.fr/~ritchied/hex_server/ and the
RosettaDock protein-protein docking server which predicts the structure of protein
complexes with respect to the structures of individual components and an approximate
binding orientation [30].

Results and Discussion
Predicted structural properties

A homology search of protein-x using several protein sequence databases from
ExPASy-blast, displayed a large conserved domain which was found in hepadnaviruses,
representing a non-homologous protein. In order to understand the physico-chemical
properties of protein-x, the frequency of amino acids in protein-x were determined
using the MEGA software. The isoelectric point of protein-x in this calculation was
8.45 and the percentage of basic residues was higher than that of the acidic ones. A
good example of this was the global propensity (GPai1) which was calculated using the
following formula: GP ai 1 = Pω ai /P ai 1 , where Pω ai is the percentage of individual
amino acids in the protein, and Pai 1 is the percentage of individual amino acids
obtained from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (ExPASy), data released on 31-May-11 was used.
The global propensities of Arg and Ser in protein-x were 1.53 and 1.49 respectively
(global propensity > 1.2 shows a significant abundance of the related amino acid). The
total charge of protein-x was positive, which could be due to the presence of high
amounts of Arg in this protein. The high percentage of Ser also shows the highly phosphorylated form of Ser. Moreover, this analysis showed that the percentages of amino
acids such as Arg, Cys, Leu and Phe were relatively high and those of Tyr, Thr, Ile,
Gln and Asn were low in contrast.
PROSITE (release 20.48) motifs revealed that protein-x included functional sites for
protein kinase C and casein kinase II associated phosphorylation, and N-myristoylation.
The predicted disulfide bonds include 7-17, 7-26, 7-61, 7-69, 7-115 and 115-148,
regions, which were obtained by the DiANNA web server.
Threading analysis and model construction

LOMETS generates full-length 3D protein structural predictions, therefore, an initial
3D model was generated for protein-x, which was selected for further refinement. The
threading results in this model were applied to the PPA-I program (PPA-I, is a simple
sequence profile-profile alignment approach combined with secondary structure
matches). The data showed that the crystal structure of the porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome virus leader protease Nsp1a [PDB:3IFU] was the best template
with a z-score = 6.287, coverage = 0.961, 23% identity. Moreover, the TM-score which
was calculated using the Zang lab server was 0.1677 [31]. A TM-score > 0.5 indicates a
model of correct topology and a TM-score < 0.17 means a random similarity, therefore
we had to refine the model and in order to predict a better model, the model was
applied as a template using MODELLER for the purpose of refinement (loop refined).
Validation of protein-x was checked by the Ramachandran plot in the PROCHECK
server to improve the refinement factors resulting in the absence of amino acids in the
disallowed region and the presence of one residue in the generously allowed regions.

http://www.tbiomed.com/content/8/1/41

The TM-score and RMSD between the final and initial models were 0.12 and 2.26,
respectively. Moreover, the protein backbone may probably move away from the native
structure.
Indeed, because of the low similarity between the templates and protein-x, comparative models were not successful. To find a good model, we used QUARK, a computer
algorithm for ab initio protein folding and protein structure prediction. Protein-x is a
relatively small protein, therefore prediction of the tertiary structure using QUARK
was possible, since QUARK constructs the correct 3D protein model from amino acid
sequence. For this reason, the results were evaluated using Verify-3D, which analyzes
the compatibility of an atomic model (3D) with its own amino acid sequences (1D).
The first model was chosen as the best model due to the evaluation mentioned above.
Each residue was assigned to a structural class based on its location and environment
(a, b, loop, polar, non-polar, etc.). A collection of good structures were used as a reference to obtain a score for each of the 20 amino acids in this structural class. The ab
initio tertiary structure of protein-x derived from QUARK and the verifid-3D plot are
shown in Figure 1, where it can be clearly observed that, there are two disulfide bonds;
Cys7-Cys61 and Cys115-Cys148. This data is compatible with the disulfide predictions
obtained from the DIANNA by prediction tools.
Docking of C/EBPa to protein-X

According to previous studies regarding the role of protein-x in binding the C/EBPa
DNA, the C/EBPa-DNA complex [PDB:1NWQ] was used for comparative purposes.
The ab initio structures of protein-x and crystal structure of the C/EBPa-DNA complex [PDB:1NWQ] were used to calculate docking using different docking servers, such

as Patchdock, Firedoc, Rosettadock, Zdock and Hex. The best model was chosen from
the overlapped results.
In all docking results, C/EBPa was found to contact protein-x at the Asn281-Asn307
position (N-terminal of the C/EBPa-DNA complex domain) (Figure 2). The Rosettadock results showed that the residues from Ser65 to Ala76 of protein-x are in close

proximity to C/EBPa (Figure 3). Other docking data showed that residues from
Thr105 to Glu125 of protein-x were involved with the C/EBPa-DNA complex domain;
this does not mean that all residues in this regions, have interactions with C/EBPa. A
vivid illustration of these interactions is demonstrated by Asp114 from protein-x and
the Arg 288 of C/EBPa. A docking result using Patchdock showed interactions
between C/EBPa DNA and protein-x (Figure 4). Indeed, the N-terminal of the
C/EBPa-DNA binding region is exposed to certain regions in protein-x. In other
words, the region spanning Asn281-Asn307 in C/EBPa could be a good candidate for
epitope prediction with respect to vaccine preparation.
An interesting point about the results of this study is the DNA interactions with protein-x, according to Figure 4, protein-x has interactions with C/EBPa in the region
covering Ala76 to Ser101. Data from this study revealed that the C-terminal part of
protein-x has an important role in the direct interaction with the b-Zip domain of
C/EBPa, which is in agreement with experimental data [1,12].

Conclusion
Even though, many studies have been carried out on the pathogenesis of protein-x in
the hepatitis B virus over the last decade, the tertiary structure of this protein still
remains obscure. Protein-x is expressed in hepatocytes, and acts as part of a proteinprotein complex to enhance the transcriptional efficacy of b-zip proteins and to alter
their DNA binding specificities [7]. This protein serves as a conserved domain and
cannot be organized into an evolutionary classification.
Furthermore, protein analysis showed that protein-x possesses a positive charge
because of its propensity for residues such as Arg. One hypothesis for the protein-x
action is the increased calcium release in the cytoplasm [5]. The phosphorylation of
HBx induces the activation of calcium protein kinase and consequently, stimulates protein-x calcium signaling effects. Protein-x has several predicted Ser and Thr phosphorylation sites, which are compatible with the experimental work for phosphorylation
when expressed both in insect and HepG2 cells [32,33]. Docking results showed that
the N-terminal of the C/EBPa-DNA domain (from 281 to 323) are involved in protein-x. These findings reveal a new perspective in drug design using an appropriate
linear epitope which can inhibit the function of protein-x.
In conclusion, this 3D model may provide some insights into the hierarchical structure of protein-x, leading to a better understanding of the function of this protein and
its interaction with the cellular proteins, which can lead to the development of new
treatments.
