Abstract
Background: Sister species divergence and reproductive isolation commonly results from
ecological adaptation. In mimetic Heliconius butterflies, shifts in colour pattern contribute to preand post-mating reproductive isolation and are commonly correlated with speciation. Closely
related mimetic species are therefore not expected, as they should lack several important sources
of reproductive isolation.
Results: Here we present phenotypic, behavioral and genetic evidence for the coexistence of two
sympatric 'cryptic' species near Florencia in the eastern Andes of Colombia that share the same
orange rayed colour pattern. These represent H. melpomene malleti and a novel taxon in the H.
cydno group, here designated as novel race of Heliconius timareta, Heliconius timareta florencia. Nochoice mating experiments show that these sympatric forms have strong assortative mating (≈96%)
despite great similarity in colour pattern, implying enhanced divergence in pheromonal signals.
Conclusion: We hypothesize that these species might have resulted from recent convergence in
colour pattern, perhaps facilitated by hybrid introgression of wing pattern genes.

Background
Ecological selection is known to play an important role in
speciation [1,2]. Where ecological traits under divergent
selection also affect the species recognition system, speciation can be rapid [3,4]. Young species pairs provide evidence for this, such as stickleback morphs found in glacial
lakes in which body size diverges through adaptation to
different niches and is correlated with mate choice [5,6].
Similarly, in Darwin's finches adaptive variation in beak
size also promotes reproductive isolation through pleiotropic effects on song [7,8]. In many butterflies colour pattern similarly plays a role in mate recognition [9,10] and

is also under ecological selection for signaling to predators, crypsis and thermoregulation [11].
In Heliconius butterflies shifts in colour pattern have been
shown to play a major role in speciation [12,13]. Closely
related species and sub-species typically differ in colour
pattern [14] and are adapted to local Müllerian mimicry
rings in which distasteful species converge on a common
pattern [15,16]. The pattern differences between related
forms lead to strong assortative mating [12,13]. Frequency
dependent selection contributes to maintaining the
mimetic patterns and also causes post-mating isolation

[17,18]. Thus, between closely related species such as H.
cydno and H. melpomene, rare hybrid individuals are likely
to be strongly selected against, as their pattern will not be
recognized by predators [12,15]. These species overlap
extensively across Central America and the Andes [19,20].
Through their geographical range, H. melpomene mimics
H. erato with a black background and red, yellow and
orange marks, whereas H. cydno mimics species of the H.
sapho group with a black-blue background and white and
yellow marks [12,21]. Although H. melpomene and H.
cydno occasionally hybridize in nature (less than 0.1%),
reproductive isolation is strong, with ecological isolation
and colour pattern associated mate choice playing the
major role [12,22,23].
The phylogeny of Heliconius supports a key role for pattern
change in speciation, with almost all sister species differing in colour pattern [24]. Exceptions such as H. sara and
H. leucadia are far more genetically divergent than species
in the H. melpomene clade, implying that speciation was
relatively ancient [24]. It was therefore a surprise when a
putative 'cryptic' species was identified in the H. cydno/
melpomene species complex, implying either mimetic convergence between closely related species, or speciation
without pattern change [25]. H. tristero was described as a
new species from the southeastern Andes of Colombia
with a cydno-like mtDNA haplotype, but a black, red and
yellow "postman" pattern similar to sympatric H. melpomene mocoa [25]. This species was initially met with
scepticism, mainly due to the fact that only two individuals of H. tristero were collected, combined with the likelihood of mtDNA introgression between H. cydno and H.
melpomene [26]. It was therefore suggested that the H. tristero specimens most likely represent rare hybrids between
H. cydno and H. melpomene.
The discovery of very closely related sympatric mimetic
forms is therefore of considerable interest as it would
imply either speciation without colour pattern shifts, or
alternatively very recent mimetic convergence between
hybridizing species, possibly through adaptive introgression [23,26]. Here we present compelling evidence of a
cryptic species pair, in which an H. cydno cognate resembles and coexists in sympatry with a well-known race of H.
melpomene (Figure 1).

Methods
Sampling and species assignment
A total of 196 adult butterflies were collected between
2002–2006 in Sucre (01°48'12¨N 75°39'19¨W) near Florencia, Colombia. For comparison of larval and adult morphology, an additional 118 butterflies representing H.
cydno weymeri (N = 21), H. c. cordula (N = 19), H. c. zelinde
(N = 12), H. melpomene vulcanus (N = 17), H. m. melpomene (N = 26) and H. m. mocoa (N = 23) were collected

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/324

from various sites in Colombia. Some of the individuals
from Florencia were maintained alive in separate insectaries at La Vega, Cundinamarca for mate and host choice
experiments. Wings were removed from the remaining
specimens and bodies preserved in DMSO or Ethanol
(96%) for subsequent phenotypic (N = 131) and molecular analysis (N = 142) and stored in the permanent collection of the Instituto de Genética of Universidad de los
Andes in Colombia (the collection is now part of the
recently created Natural History Museum ANDES). DNA
extractions were made from one-third of the thorax of
each individual using the DNeasy tissue Kit (QIAGEN),
following the manufacturers' protocol. Digital images
were obtained by scanning the wings and quantitative
measurements taken using TpsDig image software [27].
One-way Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) on phenotypic
measurements were performed with SPSS 11.0.4 software
[28].
No-choice mating experiments
Once diagnostic characters for the two morphotypes had
been established we carried out mate choice experiments
to investigate reproductive isolation. No-choice mating
trials were performed in 2 m × 2 m × 2 m insectaries in La
Vega, Cundinamarca between June 2004 and October
2005. These experiments are a simulation of a natural situation where males encounter females singly, and estimate the reluctance of both sexes to mate interspecifically. A virgin female (one to three days old) of each
morphotype was presented to ten mature males (more
than 10 days old) in a single insectary for two days. Successful and failed matings were recorded every 30 minutes
between 6 am to 2 pm. Males were used only once. In
order to detect matings that were unobserved, females
were checked for the presence of a spermatophore in their
reproductive tract. A binomial mating probability Pixj and
95% confidence intervals were obtained for each combination of i-type female and j-type male using Maximum
Likelihood as previously described [29].
Host plant choice and larval morphology
Females of both Florencia populations (H. m. malleti and
H. cydno cognate) and other populations of the two species were kept in individual insectaries with known host
plants, Passiflora edulis, P. maliformis, P. ligularis, P. arborea,
P. quadrangularis, P. oerstedii [30,31], and as controls two
species used by H. erato, P. suberosa, and P. rubra [32]. The
number of eggs laid per plant by each female was recorded
twice a week. Offspring from the same females were used
for analysis of larval morphology. H. melpomene and H.
cydno larvae are distinguishable by cephalic colour [14]
which is pale yellow in H. melpomene and orange in H.
cydno. Pictures of larvae raised from wild females were
taken under similar light conditions with a colour standard. Between four and seven larvae were analysed from

each of 21 females collected in Florencia and compared to
those from other localities. Pictures were processed using
Scion Image (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD, USA)
and four RGB indexes calculated, R' = r/(r+g+b), G' = g/
(r+g+b), B' = b/(r+g+b) and LM = R'-G' [33]. Statistical significance of differences in indices was tested with one-way
variance analysis using SPSS 11.0.4 software [28].
Sequence Analysis
We sequenced a region of nuclear DNA spanning the 3'
end of the Z-linked Triose phosphate isomerase (Tpi) gene,
from thirteen female specimens of H. m. malleti and seven
H. cydno cognate from Sucre Florencia, Caquetá and nine
specimens of H. timareta from Ecuador (additional file 1).
The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was performed

using primers and conditions outlined elsewhere [34].
The PCR products were electrophoretically separated on
1.5% low melting point agarose (Invitrogen), and the
bands were cut from the gel and dissolved in gelase (Invitrogen). Clean PCR products were sequenced using the
DNA sequence Kit (Big Dye 3.1, PE Applied Biosystems),
in an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (PE Applied Biosystems).
We also sequenced fragments of two mitochondrial genes
(COI-COII) from seventeen H.m. malleti, seven cydno-like
and seven H. timareta individuals. In addition to
sequences obtained here, we also included CO and Tpi
sequences from GenBank (additional file 1). PAUP*

mony tree, using a heuristic search with TBR branch swapping; bootstrap values were calculated with 5000
replicates using the same search conditions.
MrModeltest v2.2 [36] was used to determine the most
appropriate model of nucleotide substitution based on
hierarchical likelihood ratio tests. For the mtDNA COI/
COII data set MrModeltest identified the GTR+I+G model
[37,38], and for Tpi, the GTR+G model [37,38]. Bayesian
phylogenetic analyses were performed with MrBayes v3.1
[39] following the analytical recommendations of the
authors [40]. The base frequency parameters determined
by MrModeltest were used for analysis in MrBayes v3.1,
with remaining parameters estimated using the GTR+I+G
model for COI/COII and GTR+G for Tpi. Four differentially heated Markov chains were initiated from random
trees, run for 106 generations and sampled every 100
cycles. Likelihood values were plotted against number of
generations to determine the points at which stationary
was reached. All trees sampled before these points were
discarded and the remaining tree samples were used to
generate a 50% majority rule consensus tree (n = 12101
for COI/COII and n = 9981 for Tpi). The posterior probability of each clade is provided by the percentage of trees
identifying the clade [39,40].
Microsatellite Analyses
A total of 13 microsatellite loci were amplified and scored
as described previously [41]. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage disequilibrium and their significance
were tested for at each locus using Arlequin v2000 [42].
Two Bayesian model-based clustering algorithms implemented in the programs STRUCTURE 2.2 [43] and BAPS
4 [44] were used to test the hypothesis that the Florencia
population consisted of two clusters. We determined the
number of ancestral clusters, K, using an ad hoc statistic
ΔK based on the rate of change in the log probability of
data for K between 1 and 5 in multiple runs [45]. Each run
consisted of 106 iterations, after a burning period of 104
iterations. To use these programs, Hardy-Weinberg and
linkage equilibrium are assumed, and the software differentiates mixed populations on the basis of allele frequencies at each locus. Finally, population differentiation (FST)
and genetic distances (DA) among the two Florencia types
were calculated with Arlequin v2000 [42].

Results
One of us (ML) originally noticed that specimens collected in Florencia represented two phenotypes, one of
which was larger, darker red in colour and with a broader
forewing yellow band. However, none of these phenotypic characters proved to be reliably diagnostic (Figure
1). Only the red line, probably homologous to the previously described "red dot" in H. c. weymeri [46,47], on the
anterior edge of the ventral forewing was identified as a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/324

consistent diagnostic character of two morphotypes in the
Florencia population. There was a clearly bimodal distribution in the length of this red line, measured relative to
the distance between the base of the Discal Cell and its
intersection with the Cubital Vein (Cu2) (Figure 2). This
character was therefore used to assign individuals to the
two morphotypes for further analysis, with the longer red
line being diagnostic of H. melpomene malleti and the
shorter line of the putative H. cydno cognate. There was a
significant difference in wing size between the two morphotypes, with H. melpomene malleti having a smaller wing
size similar to other populations analysed (additional file
2). When offspring were raised from field collected
females, the colour of the larval head capsule also differed
significantly between the H. m. malleti and the H. cydno
cognate individuals from Florencia (additional file 3).
Species relationships
In mtDNA, both parsimony and Bayesian methods produced three well-supported clades (Figure 3): 1) an eastern melpomene clade, 2) an H. cydno clade including all the
H. cydno and H. timareta sequences and 3) a western melpomene clade (Figure 3). Within the cydno clade, individuals sampled near to Florencia fell into two different clades
corresponding to their phenotypic assignment described
above. Individuals with longer red line phenotypes are to
the eastern H. melpomene and those with the shorter red
line form a monophyletic group inside H. cydno. The H.
timareta samples from Ecuador form a distinct mono-

Microsatellite Data Analyses
Individuals from Florencia were screened for variation at
thirteen microsatellite loci. The H. cydno cognate was less
variable, with a mean observed heterozygosity of 0.39 as
compared to 0.66 in H. m. malleti. All loci were in HardyWeinberg equilibrium within the two morphotypes,
except Hm19, which showed significant heterozygote deficit for both forms, most likely due to null alleles which
are known to be present at this locus [48]. All subsequent
analyses are presented with this locus removed. The microsatellite FST value between the two morphotypes in Florencia was large and significant (FST = 0.24226, P <
0.0001).

Without reference to the morphological assignment, two
distinct algorithms, STRUCTURE 2.2 and BAPS 4, were
used to test the number of distinct populations (K) sampled. The ad-hoc statistic ΔK, estimated using both programs, indicated that the most likely value of K was two
(additional file 4). This conclusion was robust to different
assumptions made by STRUCTURE (presence or absence
of genetic admixture, and correlated or uncorrelated allele
frequencies). These two distinct populations identified by
STRUCTURE represented the two colour pattern types
already identified a priori, with virtually all individuals
correctly assigned to the appropriate cluster with posterior
probabilities = 0.95 (Figure 5).

are well resolved with high posterior probability and
bootstrap support (99), corresponding to H. melpomene
and H. cydno (1.1% net divergence). The individuals from
Florencia fell into the H. melpomene and H. cydno clades as
predicted from their morphological assignment (Figure
4).

Five individuals had clearly intermediate assignment
probabilities, suggesting possible hybrid genotypes. In
support of this hypothesis, these individuals also had
some evidence for colour pattern introgression, with
either somewhat intermediate red line phenotypes (Figure
2) or melanic scales in the forewing band. These individuals represented around 3.5% of the total sample (5/142)
with three of the five being consistent with an F1 genotype
(Figure 5). Five additional individuals in the H. m. malleti
cluster showed posterior probabilities less than 0.95 suggesting that these might represent backcross hybrids.
No-choice mate experiments
A total of 112 trials were performed (Table 1). An initial
null model with a single mating probability (a = b = c = d)
was established across all trials (LnL = -88.5821). To test
different hypotheses, the likelihood model was fitted in a
stepwise manner by adding parameters to the initial
model. When mating probabilities were estimated separately for intra and inter morphotypes (2p: a = d and b =
c) this led to a significant improvement in fit of the model
(G = 119.73, d.f. = 1 and p < 0.0001). This reflects the different mating frequencies between inter and intra morphotype trials (3.5% and 96.5%, respectively; Table 1). A
more complicated four parameter model with asymmetric
mating probabilities did not significantly improve fit of
the model (4p: a≠b≠c≠d, G = 4.74, d.f. = 2 and p > 0.09).

Discussion
The colour patterns of H. melpomene and H. cydno are traits
under strong ecological selection that also contribute to
speciation [12,23,26,49,50]. Divergence in mimetic pattern contributes to reproductive isolation by assortative
mating, due to the use of colour as a mate recognition signal and by frequency dependent mimicry selection
against rare colour pattern hybrids [12,23,26,29]. The fact
that such a major role for mimicry in the reproductive isolation of currently hybridizing species has been clearly
demonstrated has led to an expectation that mimicry is
unlikely between closely related species with incomplete
reproductive isolation [15]. The results of the present
study clearly show that this is not always the case. The butterflies collected in Florencia represent two mimetic species in the H. melpomene and H. cydno clades respectively.
Despite the extreme phenotypic similarity between the
butterflies studied here, the data indicate clear concordance between nuclear, mtDNA and phenotypic markers in
assigning over 90% of the individuals sampled to one or
the other morphotype. These represent a population of
the widespread race H. m. malleti, and a novel entity
related to H. cydno. Nonetheless, there is clear evidence for
ongoing interspecific hybridization with around 3.5% of
individuals sampled representing clearly identifiable
hybrids.
The strong concordance between markers and relative
scarcity of hybrids implies strong reproductive isolation.
The mating experiments described here demonstrate
strong assortative mating, and host choice experiments
further imply some degree of ecological isolation. The
strength of assortative mating in our experiments is actually greater than that between the phenotypically very
divergent H. melpomene melpomene and H. cydno cordula (≈
82%, Mavárez et al. 2006). It therefore seems likely that
there has been increased divergence in mating signals
apart from colour – most likely pheromonal – to allow the
Florencia species to coexist. As colour is used as a cue in
mate finding, we would predict that males are likely to be
attracted to the pattern of the "wrong" species, but that

this is compensated for by divergence in other mating signals.
H. melpomene and H. cydno are known to differ in habitat
preference and host use [30,51]. Our host choice data
imply that this ecological difference is maintained
between the Florencia species, with the H. cydno cognate
more of a host generalist similar to other populations of
H. cydno. It seems likely that this corresponds to a preference for forest habitats, as is the case for other H. cydno
populations, leading to ecological isolation. Although
crosses between the Florencia forms have not been carried
out, there is preliminary evidence that the H. cydno cognate morphotype is compatible with other populations of
H. cydno, while the Florencia H. m. malleti shows hybrid
sterility with H. cydno (Giraldo and Linares, unpub). It
seems likely that the Florencia species show similar
female hybrid sterility as compared to other sympatric H.
melpomene and H. cydno populations.
In order to clarify the role of colour pattern in speciation
we need to consider the order of divergence in different
factors. Divergence might have occurred initially in factors
other than colour pattern, such as habitat preference and
pheromonal mating cues. Divergence in mimicry then
occurred subsequent to speciation in most populations of
the H. cydno group, except those in the eastern Andes such
as that studied here. Alternatively, speciation might have
been initially triggered by divergence in colour pattern
with mimetic convergence a derived state acquired subsequent to speciation in the Florencia region. The first explanation is more parsimonious with respect to colour
pattern, but may actually be less likely. The derived position of the H. cydno cognate form in the mtDNA phylogeny suggests that it has evolved from a more H. cydno like
ancestor (Figure 3). Furthermore, the observation that
intraspecific races of H. melpomene show both divergent
colour patterns and strong assortative mating implies that
mimicry and associated mate preferences are the first steps
in divergence in this group [13].
Under the second scenario, an initial divergence in colour
pattern associated with adaptation to different Müllerian
mimicry rings became associated with further changes in
ecology and hybrid inviability, eventually leading to spe-

ciation [12]. Subsequently, strong mimetic selection in
the sympatric Florencia population has led to convergence of H. cydno onto the H. melpomene pattern. This
might have occurred through adaptive introgression of
colour pattern genes between the species [21,23,26,5254]. It seems plausible that the lack of suitable mimicry
models in the H. sapho group has led this east Andean
population to secondarily converge on the H. melpomene
pattern.
Our results raise the possibility that other populations of
cryptic species might exist in Heliconius. Notably the cryptic H. cydno cognate, H. tristero which was described based
on two specimens and shares a red and yellow banded
colour pattern with sympatric H. m. mocoa in Putumayo,
Colombia may represent another example of the same
phenomenon [25] (Figure 6). Another potential case
occurs in Peru, where a "postman" H. cydno has been discovered that mimics H. m. amaryllis (Mavaréz et al.
unpub.).
The new H. cydno cognate from Florencia resembles H.
timareta, a known relative of H. cydno from eastern Ecuador. H. timareta is polymorphic with one orange rayed
form that is very similar to the taxon from Florencia (Figure 6). Furthermore, a recently described subspecies, H. t.
timoratus Lamas (1998) from Perú is a near perfect mimic
of H. m. malleti, although the two have so far not been collected in sympatry (Figure 6). Due to the colour pattern
similarity with H. t. timoratus of Perú and the east Andean
distribution of both forms, here we propose the H. cydno
cognate from Florencia as a new northern race of H. timareta, which forms a mimicry ring with H. m. malleti and H.
e. lativitta in the southern foothills of Colombia. We propose to name this form after Florencia, the town where it
was discovered. From a geographical point of view (Figure
6) the H. cydno clade in the eastern Andes is represented
by, from north to south, H. cydno cordula, H. heurippa, H.
timareta florencia and H. tristero in Colombia; H. timareta
timareta in Ecuador and H. timareta timoratus and another
new H. cydno-like taxon in Perú (Mavarez et al., in prep.).
H. timareta florencia is anatomically similar to H. timareta
and H. cydno races, with a FW area of 5,26 to 6,64 cm2
(additional file 2). The FW has two principal pattern elements in a black background, 1. An irregular yellow postmedial band extending proximodistally from distal end of
discal cell to R2–R3 fork, and laterally from subcostal to
CU1a, and 2. A red "Dennis" element extending from the
basal end of the discal cell to the CU1b-discal cell fork,
which is generally shorter than the H. m. malleti FW element (the approximate basal fourth of the FW). The ventral FW is similar with a slight reduction in the yellow
band area and the distinguishing red line with length 2,65
to 5,92 mm (Figure 1b and Figure 2). The HW also has a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/324

black background colour and an androconial distribution
as in H. timareta. A reddish dennis-ray element [55] is similar in form to the dennis-ray in H. m. malleti, with a narrow red longitudinal bar D (Dennis) and six red radiate
marks on the discal part of the upper side [55]. The ventral
HW underside is similar with narrower red areas. Males
and females are phenotypically similar. H. t. florencia is
registered in ZooBank with the unique digital identifier
LSID: 49656F41-E817-4FD6-B28D-6AA362CC5268. In

Conclusion
Obviously the study of cryptic species has a long history
and, especially with the advent of modern molecular techniques many previously undescribed taxa have been
detected [56]. However, cryptic species often use sensory
modalities that humans do not readily perceive, such as
pheromones [57,58], toxicity resistance [59] and imperceptible song differences [60]. The surprising aspect of this
study is therefore the discovery of cryptic species in wellstudied taxa where speciation is commonly triggered by
bright visual signals. It is increasingly becoming clear that
tropical biodiversity is severely underestimated and that
combining morphological and DNA sequence analysis is
a powerful tool for species discovery. Finally, our mate
and host choice experiments suggest that the sympatric
species in Florencia combine the same ecological differences known to occur in other parts of the range of H.
cydno and H. melpomene with enhanced pheromonal signals to compensate for the lack of colour pattern signals.
Our results therefore highlight the fact that speciation is
the combined result of divergence along multiple phenotypic axes.

Forewing size between H. cydno and H. melpomene. Wild individuals from Florencia and museum specimens of H. cydno and H. melpomene were measured for forewing area. Wings were scanned next to a
ruler and processed in tpsUtil and tpsDig 9 image software to measure
area. Tests for normal distribution were carried out for each species and a
one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) by species and sex was performed
in SPSS to test for differences in size. Tukey's post-hoc was used to compare median values between pairwise population sets. H. m. malleti did
not differ in wing area from other H. melpomene races (ANOVA p >
0,05). H. cydno cognate wing area is similar to H. cydno races
(ANOVA p > 0,05).

dark and broad bands, while H. cydno has a dark yellow-orange cephalic
tone and light narrow bands. b' = b/(r+g+b) based on RGB filters using
the procedure as in Endler et al. 1990. H. cydno races are: H. c. cordula,
H. c. cydnides and H. c. zelinde and H. melpomene races are H. m.
mocoa and H. m. vulcanus. Analysis of variance shows high differences
between melpomene and cydno groups (H. melpomene and H. m.
malleti vs. H. cydno and H. cydno cognate; p < 0,0001).
