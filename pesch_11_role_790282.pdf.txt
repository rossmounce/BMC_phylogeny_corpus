Role of TRIPTYCHON in trichome patterning in
Arabidopsis
Martina Pesch and Martin Hülskamp*

Abstract
Background: Trichome patterning in Arabidopsis thaliana is governed by three types of activators, R2R3MYB, bHLH
and WD40 proteins, and six R3MYB inhibitors. Among the inhibitors TRIPTYCHON (TRY) seems to fulfill a special
function. Its corresponding mutants produce trichome clusters whereas all other inhibitors are involved in trichome
density regulation.
Results: To better understand the role of TRY in trichome patterning we analyzed its transcriptional regulation. A
promoter analysis identified the relevant regulatory region for trichome patterning. This essential region contains a
fragment required for a double negative feedback loop such that it mediates the repression of TRY/CPC autorepression. By transforming single cells of pTRY:GUS lines with p35S:GL1, p35S:GL3 and p35S:TTG1 in the presence or
absence of p35S:TRY or p35S:CPC we demonstrate that TRY and CPC can suppress the TRY expression without the
transcriptional down regulation of the activators. We further show by promoter/CDS swapping experiments for the
R3MYB inhibitors TRY and CPC that the TRY protein has specific properties relevant in the context of both, cluster
formation and trichome density.
Conclusions: Our identification of a TRY promoter fragment mediating a double negative feedback loop reveals
new insight in the regulatory network of the trichome patterning machinery. In addition we show that the autorepression by TRY can occur without a transcriptional down regulation of the activators, suggesting that the
differential complex formation model has a biological significance. Finally we show that the unique role of TRY
among the inhibitors is a property of the TRY protein.

Background
Trichome patterning in Arabidopsis thaliana has
become a well-studied model system to understand cellcell communication in the context of two-dimensional
pattern formation in plants [1-3]. Trichomes are formed
in the basal part of young leaves [4]. The trichome position is not correlated with any recognizable leaf structures and clonal analysis excluded a cell lineage
mechanism [5,6]. For these reasons, it is widely accepted
that patterning is mediated by cellular interactions
between initially equivalent cells [2,3,7].
Genetic screens have identified two classes of mutants
governing this process. All patterning genes except for
TTG1 have close homologs acting in a partially redundant manner [8-16]. The following summary will only
consider the most relevant players as judged by the

strength of the mutant phenotypes. One mutant class
shows fewer or no trichomes. The corresponding genes
are therefore considered positive regulators of trichome
formation. The three most important positive regulators
are the WD40 protein TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 (TTG1) [17-19], the R2R3 MYB related transcription factor GLABRA1 (GL1) [20], and the basic helixloop-helix (bHLH)-like transcription factor GLABRA3
(GL3) [4,21,22].
In the second class, trichome clusters or a higher trichome density indicate a repressive role. The two most
important inhibitors are the R3 single-repeat MYB factors TRIPTYCHON (TRY) and CAPRICE (CPC) [12,23].
Although, the two corresponding genes show high
sequence similarity and an indistinguishable expression
pattern in leaves [12], their mutant phenotypes suggest
different modes of action. While the cpc mutant has a
higher trichome density, the try mutant shows trichome
clusters and a reduction in trichome number [4,12].

The expression pattern of most patterning genes is
very similar. Initially, all genes are expressed ubiquitously in the cells at the leaf basis where trichome initials are formed (patterning zone). Later, expression
increases in trichomes and disappears in epidermal cells
[10-14,16,24-26]. The ubiquitous expression corresponds
to the pre-pattern situation in which all cells are equivalent. During this phase the positive and negative regulators are considered to be engaged in regulatory feedback loops that have several important features including the activation of the inhibitors by the activators, the
repression of the activators by the inhibitors and the
ability of the inhibitors to move between cells
[14,15,27,28]. These create differences between the cells
and ultimately result in a pattern of trichome and nontrichome cells [2,3].
After the initial pattern is established leaf growth leads
to an increased spacing of trichomes without the formation of new trichomes. As in this phase patterning gene
expression has ceased in epidermal pavement cells and
increased in trichomes, the loss of trichome initiation
competence is most likely due to the absence of activator gene expression. Whether activator gene expression
in later leaf stages is generally shut off during leaf
maturation or due to lateral repression by TRY and/or
the other inhibitors is not clear.
The proposed regulatory feedback loop between the
activators and the inhibitors ultimately leads to an autorepression of the inhibitors. This could in principle be
achieved in two ways. As the R3 single repeat MYB
inhibitors lack a transcriptional activation region they
could bind to promoter elements of the activators
thereby preventing the transcription of the activators.
As the repressors are activated by the activators the
reduction of activator activity leads to reduced inhibitor
transcription. Alternatively, the inhibitors could posttranslationally render the activation complex inactive
[29]. Yeast two hybrid experiments showed that GL1
and TTG1 bind different regions of the GL3 protein
suggesting that they form a trimeric transcriptional activation complex [22]. Binding of TRY or CPC to GL3
was shown to displace GL1 thereby inactivating the
complex [14,29]. Although both mechanisms lead to a
repression of the inhibitors they differ in their regulation
scheme. The transcriptional repression of the activators
by binding of TRY and/or CPC to the promoters would
create a regulatory feed back loop that involves transcriptional down regulation of the activators. The postulated repression by differential complex formation
would establish a shortcut of the regulatory feedback
loop as the inhibitors can directly repress their own
activation.
In this manuscript, we analyze the transcriptional regulation of TRY during trichome patterning. First, we

determined the TRY promoter fragment relevant for
TRY function and the specific basal and trichome-specific expression pattern. In addition we identified separate
regions that are necessary for an enhancement of the
specific expression pattern and showed that these
regions are necessary for rescue. Second, we showed
that TRY or CPC can repress the TRY expression
directly without the transcriptional regulation of the
activators by transforming single epidermal cells of
pTRY:GUS lines with the three activators and TRY or
CPC. Finally, we performed promoter swap experiments
with CPC and TRY and tested the ability to rescue the
try mutant trichome phenotypes. These experiments
revealed specific properties of the TRY protein for clustering and trichome density regulation.

Results
In a previous study, it was shown that a 4.2 kb genomic
region containing a 1.8 kb 5’ region and a 1.3 kb 3’
region is sufficient to rescue the try mutant phenotype
[12]. In a first step, we tested whether the 3’ region or
the introns are relevant for TRY function by transforming try mutant plants with a 1.8 kb 5’ region that was
fused to the TRY CDS (Figure 1, pTRY-A, B:cTRY tryJC). These plants showed complete rescue of the clustering phenotype indicating that the 1.8 kb 5’ region contains all regulatory sequences necessary for the correct
TRY expression in the leaf epidermis.
Expression analysis of TRY promoter fragments

To identify specific regulatory elements, 5’ promoter
fragments were generated and their regulatory function
monitored by fusion to the p35S-minimal promoter and
the GUS marker gene (Figure 1A and 2). Because
expression of a given construct is variable between different T2 lines we present pictures of the lines with the
strongest expression only (Figure 2) and provide the
percentage of lines in which the basal expression as well
as trichome expression and those in which only the trichome specific expression is found after 24 hours of
GUS staining (Figure 1B). Assuming that promoter elements driving a weak expression yield fewer transgenic
lines with a strong expression this percentage is taken
as an approximation of the expression strength of the
promoter fragment under consideration.
For the expression analysis we initially used a fragment starting immediately upstream of an unique putative TATA Box located 32 base pairs upstream of the
possible transcription start as determined by RACE PCR
[12] (Figure 1A, pTRY-A). This fragment revealed GUS
expression in trichomes, but the ubiquitous expression
in young leaf regions (basal expression) observed before
[12] was absent (Figure 2C, D). We therefore included
the fragment immediately following the A-fragment and

Figure 1 A series of deletions in the 5’ regulatory region of the TRY gene. A) Schematic overview showing the relative positions of TRY
promoter fragments with respect to the start codon of the different fragments. Each fragment is fused to the CaMV 35S minimal promoter and
either to the GUS coding region or to the TRY CDS followed by the nopaline synthase terminator. Single fragments (A or B) or their fusion were
used (A+B). B) Summary of the GUS expression data. We distinguish between the ubiquitous expression called “basal expression” and expression
in trichomes. We found two categories, basal and trichome expression and expression only in trichomes. The percentage of analyzed
independent T2 lines showing the respective expression category is provided. Data marked with a “*” showed exclusively weak staining as
exemplified in Figure 2J. C) Overview of the rescue efficiency. It was determined by the ability to reduce trichome cluster formation in the try-JC
mutant. The percentage of clusters relative to the number of trichome initiation sites was calculated on the first four leaves. Statistical difference
for each rescue experiment in comparison to Col wild type or to the try mutant is determined through Student’s t-test. The difference between
the respective two means is significant for P < 0,01.

stretching to the -4 position relative to the ATG start
codon (pTRY-B). pTRY-B represents the 5’ UTR identified by Schellmann et al. and includes three possible
transcriptional start sides suggested by ESTs
(EH866228.1, AV533156.1, AI999616.1) and two putative TATA boxes (TATTA, TATAAA) [12,30-32]. A
promoter fragment, pTRY-A, B, combining pTRY-A and
pTRY-B revealed also trichome specific expression in
22,7% of the lines but in addition 61,9% of the lines (n
= 35) showed the basal expression as well as the expression in trichomes. The pTRY-B fragment alone showed
no expression. This indicates that the pTRY-B fragment
is essential to enhance or stabilize the expression driven
by the pTRY-A fragment.
A further deletion series revealed a minimal promoter
region of about 620 bp (pTRY-A3, B). As found for the
pTRY-A fragment the pTRY-B region is also necessary
in the context of the pTRY-A3 fragment to mediate
basal expression (Figure 2E, F). Further 5’ deletion of
about 200 bp (pTRY-A4, B) revealed trichome specific
expression but only weak basal expression. Trichomespecific expression in these lines was only found in
advanced stages of trichome development after branch

formation (Figure 2G, H). The 200 bp fragment pTRYA5, B revealed no basal expression and only sometimes
a weak irregular expression in trichomes (Figure 2I, J).
These data do not allow to decide whether the pTRYB fragment enhances both, the basal and trichome specific expression or whether it specifically regulates the
basal expression. We therefore compared the expression
pattern in pTRY-A3, B and pTRY-A3 at different time
points of GUS staining procedure (data not shown). We
observed that the GUS staining in young trichomes
became detectable in both lines after two hours. While
the basal expression in pTRY-A3, B became also detectable after two hours, no basal expression was detectable
in pTRY-A3 even after 4 days of GUS staining. These
data suggest, that the pTRY-B fragment specifically upregulates the basal TRY expression in the context of the
pTRY-A3 fragment.
Identification of relevant promoter regions by rescue
experiments

In order to test their functionality we used various promoter fragments to express the TRY CDS in try-JC
mutant plants (Figure 1A, C). In order to avoid the

Figure 2 Expression pattern of the 5’ regulatory regions of the TRY promoter as revealed by GUS reporter gene expression. The GUS
expression pattern driven by different promoter fragments was monitored on young leaves at stages where new trichomes were still initiated
(A, C, E, G and I) and for slightly older leaves in which trichome initiation had already stopped (B, D, F, H and J). Pictures were taken in each
case from one of the strongest T2 lines carrying the respective TRY promoter GUS fusion construct: pTRY-A, B:GUS (A, B), pTRY-A:GUS (C, D), pTRYA3, B:GUS (E, F), pTRY-A4, B:GUS (G, H) and pTRY-A5, B:GUS (I, J). Bars indicate the magnification of the images.

problem that individual transformants may show a wide
range of phenotypes we did not select individual lines
for analysis in the T2 but directly analyzed the phenotype of T1 plants to hold account on the full phenotypic
spectrum. In these experiments both, the pTRY-A, B
and the pTRY-A3, B fragments fully rescued the clustering phenotype (Figure 1C). Expression of TRY driven by
pTRY-A3, however, had no significant rescue ability
(Figure 1C). The smaller fragment (pTRY-A4, B) only
partially rescued the try-JC clustering phenotype.
Together these data indicate that the pTRY-B fragment
is essential for rescue.
Regulation of the TRY promoter by TTG1, GL3, GL1 and
TRY or CPC

In a next step we aimed to demonstrate the postulated
activation/repression scheme of TTG1, GL3, GL1, TRY
and CPC for the minimal TRY promoter fragment. The
current models assume that TTG1, GL3 and GL1 can
transcriptional activate the inhibitors TRY or CPC and
that these in turn repress the activators and thereby also
their own expression. The finding that TRY and CPC
can compete with GL1 for binding to GL3 [14,29] suggests that the inhibitors can counteract the activity of
the activators at the protein level directly. In this case
TRY or CPC repress their own expression without a
transcriptional repression of the activators.
As TRY has been shown to be regulated by the activators in genetic experiments [27] the TRY promoter

Page 5 of 14

provides a tool to demonstrate that TRY/CPC can counteract the activators without a transcriptional repression
of the activators. We used cotyledons for our analysis as
no GUS expression was detected in this organ in pTRYA3, B:GUS plants (Figure 3C). GL1, GL3 and TTG1
CDS under the control of the p35S promoter were used
for transient transformations. In addition to these three
constructs we added a p35S:GFP:YFP construct to control the bombardment efficiency. In four independent
experiments analyzing each time 100 cells we found on
average 68.2 ± 18.0% GUS expressing cells indicating
that the simultaneous constitutive expression of TTG1,
GL3 and GL1 induces the minimal TRY promoter fragment (Figure 3). Transformation with 35S:GFP:YFP
alone revealed no GUS positive cells.
In a second step we tested the model whether TRY or
CPC can counteract the activity of the activators. Models derived from the finding that TRY and CPC compete
with GL1 for binding to GL3 in yeast three hybrid
experiments suggest that differential complex formation
renders the proposed activator complex inactive [14,29].
We took advantage of the fact that in this experimental
setup any indirect repression of TRY by TRY or CPC
through the transcriptional repression of the activators
is excluded as their expression is under the control of
the 35S promoter. In four independent experiments
with 100 cells in each experiment we found only 0.2 ±
0.5% or 0.2 ± 0.4% GUS-positive cells when expressing
p35S:TRY or p35S:CPC respectively in addition to the

three activators. This indicates that TRY and CPC can
counteract TRY activation by the three activators without a transcriptional repression of the activators.
Relevance of MYB and MYC binding sites

Our finding that the activators can activate the TRY promoter in transient expression assays together with the
finding that GL3 and GL1 bind to the TRY promoter in
ChIP experiments [33,34] prompted us to search for
putative MYB and MYC (bHLH factor) binding sites. We
found five putative MYB and two putative MYC sites in
the pTRY-A3, B fragment that was the minimal promoter
fragment for full rescue of the try phenotype (Table 1).
Among the five putative MYB sites two seemed most
promising as they were identified in the context of regulatory pathways in other plants that are also regulated by
TTG1-dependent pathways [35]. In addition the MYB
factor binding to these MYB binding sites are in the
same clade in the phylogenetic tree as GL1 [36]. We
therefore focused on these two putative binding sites. To
determine the role of the two selected MYB and the two
MYC sites in the regulation of the correct expression pattern we mutated each site individually and both MYB and
both MYC sites together (Figure 4C). None of the
mutated constructs showed a marked reduction or even
absence of pTRY-A3, B:GUS expression (Figure 4B).
However, we noted differences such that the MYB1 site
has the most positive effect on the basal expression
whereas the MYB2 and the MYC sites have a repressive
role. As a pTRY-A3, B:TRY construct containing mutations in both MYC sites resulted in a complete rescue of
the try mutant clustering phenotype these sites do not
appear to be relevant in this context (Additional File 1)
The pTRY-B region mediates the repression of the
inhibitors repression

In a separate line of experiments we tested, whether
reduced pTRY:GUS expression in the absence of the
pTRY-B fragment or in the pTRY-A4, B lines is caused
by endogenous R3MYB repressor activity. We compared
the expression of the pTRY-A3, B, pTRY-A3 and pTRYA4, B constructs in wild type and the cpc try mutant
background (Figure 5). All constructs revealed a strong
basal and trichome specific GUS expression. Thus the
lack of basal expression in the pTRY-A3 line and the
lack of basal and most of the trichome specific expression in the pTRY-A4, B line is rescued in the cpc try
mutant. These data suggest that the -424 to -176 fragment (pTRY-A4) promotes the basal expression and that
the pTRY-B fragment and the -623 to -424 (pTRY-A5)
fragments mediate repression of the inhibitors
repression.
In order to show that this repression of the inhibitors
repression involves the patterning activators we used

Page 6 of 14

transient expression assays. The p35S:GL1, p35S:GL3
and p35S:TTG1 constructs were co-bombarded in wild
type and cpc try mutants carrying the pTRY-A3, B,
pTRY-A3 and pTRY-A4, B constructs (Table 2). In wild
type we found GUS-positive cells only in plants carrying
the pTRY-A3, B construct (n = 100). By contrast, all
constructs revealed GUS-positive cells in the cpc try
mutant background indicating that this regulation event
involves the trichome patterning activators. Furthermore
the percentage of GUS-positive cells per transformed
epidermal cells was much higher for pTRY-A3, B transformed cotyledons in cpc try double mutant indicating a
stronger activation.
Specific properties of the TRY protein in the regulation of
cluster formation and trichome density

The fact that among the six R3 single repeat MYB inhibitor genes only mutations in TRY lead to a clustering phenotype raised the question, whether the transcriptional
regulation of TRY or its protein properties constitute this
difference. We therefore compared reciprocal swaps of
promoters and CDS of the TRY and CPC genes for their
ability to rescue the try mutant. CPC was chosen because
it represents the main inhibitor for trichome density regulation and because it has a similar expression pattern
including the early ubiquitous and later trichome specific
expression. Here we chose 525 bp of the 5’ upstream
region of the CPC gene, which showed the expected CPC
expression in leaves and roots (Additional File 2), and was
able to rescue the cpc mutant trichome phenotype when
fused to the CPC CDS (Additional File 3). Both combinations containing the CDS of TRY, pTRY:cTRY and pCPC:
cTRY, completely rescued the clustering phenotype (Figure
6). By contrast, the combination of the TRY promoter with
the CDS of CPC exhibited no significant rescue (Figure 6).
This indicates that the specific role of TRY in preventing
cluster formation is not based on its transcriptional regulation but on specific protein properties.
We also determined the trichome number in these rescued lines. In this respect try mutants have the opposite
effect as all the other inhibitor mutants in showing
fewer trichomes than wild type [12]. Expression of TRY
under the control of the TRY promoter can significantly
rescue the trichome number. By contrast, the pTRY:
cCPC construct revealed weak but not significant rescue.
When using the CPC promoter we found no rescue with
the pCPC:cCPC construct and an overexpression phenotype leading to less or even no trichomes in pCPC:cTRY
plants. Thus in summary, we recognized protein-specific
properties of TRY in the context of TRY dependent trichome density regulation. The finding that the TRY
CDS driven by the CPC promoter could not rescue the
try density defect suggests additional relevant differences
between the two promoters in this context.

Discussion
In this study we analyzed the transcriptional regulation
of TRY to learn more about the unique role of TRY in
trichome patterning among the R3MYBs homologs as
judged by the clustering phenotype of the try mutants.
Role of the pTRY-B fragment: general enhancer/
suppressor or regulator of basal expression

Our promoter analyses revealed an important role of the
pTRY-B fragment as it is absolutely necessary for the
basal expression in the young leaf and for rescuing the

clustering phenotype of the try mutant. It seems to modulate the spatial-temporal expression pattern. Several
findings suggest that pTRY-B is specifically required for
the basal expression of TRY. First, we never found any
basal expression in the absence of the pTRY-B fragment
in wild type background. Second, the expression in trichomes is similarly strong (as judged by the GUS staining
time course experiments) with and without the pTRY-B
fragment and the basal expression co-appears with the
trichome specific expression in the presence of the
pTRY-B fragment, but is not seen after 4 days without.

Figure 5 Expression pattern of 5’ regulatory regions of the TRY promoter in the cpc try double mutant as revealed by GUS reporter
gene expression. The GUS expression pattern driven by different promoter fragments was monitored on young leaves at stages when new
trichomes are still initiated. Pictures were taken in each case from one of the strongest T2 lines carrying the respective TRY promoter GUS fusion
construct in the cpc-1 try82 double mutant: (A) pTRY-A, B:GUS, (B) pTRY-A3, B:GUS, (C) pTRY-A3:GUS, (D) pTRY-A4, B:GUS.

The absolute requirement of pTRY-B for rescue of the
try clustering phenotype immediately suggests that the
basal expression of TRY is relevant for patterning. This
finding would be an important piece of support for the
current theoretical models [2]. As the pattern is generated in a field of initially equivalent cells, the patterning
system needs to start with an initially ubiquitous expression of activators and inhibitors that is necessary for the
establishment of a pattern. Thus, according to this scenario the requirement of the pTRY-B fragment and
therefore also of the basal expression supports this type
of model.
How is the basal TRY expression regulated by the
pTRY-B fragment? An answer towards this end comes
from our analysis of the pTRY-A3, B:GUS and pTRYA3:GUS constructs in try cpc mutants. The findings that
the pTRY-A3 fragment can be activated by GL1 GL3
and TTG1 in the try cpc double mutants but not in wild

type together with the presence of basal expression in
pTRY-A3 try cpc plants indicates that the pTRY-B fragment mediates the repression of the TRY repression by
TRY or CPC. Thus the apparent requirement of the
pTRY-B fragment for basal expression is in fact a double
negative regulatory event. The current data suggest that
the -424 to -176 fragment is important for turning on
the basal expression and that TRY/CPC inhibit this activation with the immediate upstream -623 to -424 and
downstream -176 to -4 regions counteracting this inhibition. As the absence of the MYB2 site leads to an
increased basal expression it is possible that this site is
involved in this regulation loop. Similarly, the higher
basal expression upon the deletion of the two MYC
sites can be interpreted as a function of these sites in
the double negative repression loop.

Table 2 Co-transformation promoter activation assay in
Arabidopsis cotyledons

Models explaining trichome formation in Arabidopsis
are derived from the activator-inhibitor model formulated by Meinhardt und Gierer [37]. This theoretical
model explains pattern formation with two components:
an activator activates its own inhibitors and its own
expression with the inhibitor being able to move faster
than the activator.
When adapting this theoretical model to the biological context there are two possibilities. First, the

inhibitor down-regulates its own expression indirectly
through the down regulation of the activator. Second,
the inhibitor represses its own expression through
competitive complex formation [27,29,38]. While we
can not exclude the first possibility, our data show that
the second scenario is sufficient. We show that the
minimal TRY promoter can be ectopically activated by
the combined expression of GL1, GL3 and TTG1 in
cotyledon cells. As the three activators are expressed
under the control of the 35S promoter any transcriptional feed back loops involving these three genes are
unlikely to be relevant in this experiment. The repression of the activity of the three activators by TRY or
CPC provides evidence that TRY and CPC represses
the TRY expression directly rather than through a
transcriptional feed back loop involving the activator
genes.

Specific properties of TRY protein for patterning

To further understand the molecular nature of the
uniqueness of TRY among the six R3-single repeat MYB
inhibitors, we used promoter swap experiments with
CPC which shares all aspects of the TRY expression pattern as judged by promoter:GUS analysis. This enabled
us to study the relevance of the transcriptional regulation and protein function of both genes in the try
mutant cluster formation and density phenotypes. We
found a different behavior of TRY and CPC proteins in
these rescuing experiments such that only TRY protein
could rescue the try mutant clustering and density phenotype when expressed under the TRY promoter. A
similar situation was found in cpc mutant rescue experiments where the TRY protein expression under the control of the CPC promoter resulted in a stronger
overexpression phenotype as compared to the CPC

Pesch and Hülskamp BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:130
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/130

protein [39]. A contribution of TRY specific promoter
properties was only found in the context of trichome
density regulation. This is contrast to the behavior of
ETC3 another homolog of TRY and CPC. The etc3
mutant could be rescued by ETC3 in the same manner
by regulation through the ETC3, CPC and TRY promoter, so that the promoters were interchangeable with
respect to the trichome density phenotype in the etc3
mutant but not with respect to the try mutant [14].
Thus TRY dependent regulation of trichome density is
dependent on both, specific protein properties as well as
specific aspects of transcriptional regulation.
The observed differences between TRY and CPC protein functions could in principle be due to various
aspects including the protein stability, protein movement and their interaction with other proteins, in particular the bHLH factors. Both proteins have been shown
to interact with bHLH factors [10,11,13,14,16,40]. Their
interactions, however, seem to differ as CPC binds
stronger to GL3 [41] and suppresses the binding of GL1
to GL3 more efficiently than TRY [14]. Different
strength in their binding to GL3 is also likely to change
the intercellular movement of TRY and CPC [14]. Both
proteins have been shown to move between cells and
share a 79 bp N-terminal region in which W76 and
M78 were shown to be necessary for movement of CPC
and are conserved in the TRY protein [27,28,38]. However, TRY protein is lacking the first 9aa that were also
be shown to be necessary for CPC movement [28] and
could therefore in principle be responsible for a different
movement behavior. The most obvious difference
between the TRY protein and CPC, ETC1, ETC2, ETC3
and TCL1 is its c-terminal extension of unknown function [41]. While we begin to understand the functional
diversification of the R3 single MYB factors in trichome
development it is still elusive which properties are
responsible for the differences in their requirement for
clustering and density control.

Conclusions
In this work we show that the auto-repressive effect of
TRY does not require a transcriptional downregulation
of the activators suggesting that differential complex formation is biologically relevant. We further show that the
unique role of TRY among the inhibitors is a property
of the TRY protein. Finally our analysis of the TRY promoter lead to the identification of a 620 bp fragment
sufficient to rescue the try mutant phenotype. It contains a fragment that mediates the repression of its own
repression suggesting a complex regulation scheme. It is
likely, that we are seeing here just the tip of an iceberg,
as the transcriptional regulation of TRY has additional
complexity at the level of organ specificity involving
additional regulatory genes such as the well studied

(SPL) gene [42].

Methods
Plant lines and growth conditions

Plants were grown on soil at 24°C in a 16 h light/8 h
dark cycle. Plant transformations were performed by the
floral dip method [43]. The transgenic pTRY-A3, B:GUS
Ler and cpc-1 try-82 double mutant [12] line was generated by a genetic cross. Complementation experiments
were done in try-JC and cpc-1 mutants [23,44] and Col0 and WS-0 respectively as a control. For the transient
transformation of cotyledons pTRY-A3, B:GUS, pTRYA3:GUS and pTRY-A4, B:GUS lines in Ler or in cpc-1
try-82 double mutant background were used. For these
experiments surface sterilized seeds were grown on MS
plates containing 1% sucrose and 20 μg/ml Basta for 7
days at 22°C with 16 h light/8 h dark cycle.
Constructs

Construction of the TRY and CPC promoter fragments Ler pTRY-B was cloned as a HindIII fragment in
pGEM-T-easy. All other promoter fragments were
cloned in pDONR201 by BP reactions (Invitrogen). Promoter mutations were introduced by PCR based site
directed mutagenesis (details are available on request).
pENTR1A-w/o-ccdB was created by deleting the EcoRI
fragment to take out the Gateway recombination cassette inside the attB sequences of pENTR1A. All fragments were verified by sequencing. (Detailed primer
information see Additional File 4).
CaMV 35S minimal promoter GUS and CDS constructs The basic Gateway destination vector PARB
(pANGUS-Gateway RekombinationscasetteA-Basta-resistence) was created in several steps. The CaMV 35S
minimal promoter (-46 to +7) fused to the GUS gene
from pBT-GUS [45] was cloned as a BamHI and XmaI
fragment into pPAM (GenBank AY027531). The Gateway recombination cassette A (Invitrogen) was cloned
as a BcuI and SalI fragment in pANGUS (pANGUSRecA). The kanamycin resistance was replaced by the
bar gene with nos-promoter and nos-terminator from
pGREEN-Bar as a RsrII and SpeI fragment. The pTRY-B
fragment was cloned into the HindIII site of PARB
directly in front of the 35S minimal promoter to create
PARB-B. PARB-TRY-CDS, PARB-B-TRY-CDS, PARBCPC-CDS are derivates of PARB and PARB-B in which
the GUS gene was replaced by the TRY or CPC CDS
(Ler).
Promoter-GUS- and promoter-CDS constructs were
generated by LR recombinations (Invitrogen) using the
entry clones pCPC-pDONR201, pENTR1A-w/o-ccdB
and the different entry clones of the deletion and substitution series of pTRY and the different destination vectors derived from PARB.

Effector constructs for transient co-transformation
experiments of Arabidopsis epidermal cotyledon cells
CDS’s from Ler were cloned in pENTR1A or by BP
recombination in pDONR201. The effector constructs
(p35S:GL1, p35S:GL3, p35S:TTG1, p35S:TRY, p35S:CPC)
and the control p35S:GFP:YFP were created by LR
recombination of the respective entry clones with pAMPAT-GW.
Histochemical analysis and microscopy

GUS activity was assayed as described previously [46].
For light microscopy we used a Leica DMRE microscope. Images were taken with a KY-F70 3-CCD JVC
camera and DISKUS software (DISKUS, Technisches
Büro). In all experiments 35 independent T2 lines were
used for statistical analysis.
Evaluation of the trichome initiation sites and cluster
frequency

Trichome initiation sites and the number of trichome
clusters were counted on the first four fully expanded
leaves on 50 individual T1 plants after Basta selection
and on 30 Col-0, WS-0, try-JC and cpc-1 plants. The
significance of the difference between complemented
plants and either Col or try-JC was tested by Student’s
T-test (two-tailed distribution and two-sample equal
variance, P < 0,01). Trichome density and cluster frequency data in the promoter CDS swap experiment are
shown as box-whisker-plots. The quartile function of
Excel (Microsoft Office Standard 2007) was used to
return the five quartiles for the data sets (minimum
value, first quartile (25th percentile), median value, third
quartile (75th percentile) and maximum value). The plot
itself was created with a free accessible boxplot template
(http://www.austromath.at/medienvielfalt/materialien/
beschreibendeStatistik/content).
Microprojectile Bombardment

Transient TRY expression analysis was carried out by
using the particle bombardment method in Arabidopsis cotyledons [47]. Each set of experiment was done
independently at least four times. After bombardment
plants were grown for 24 h and the number of transformed cells was determined by the presence of the
co-bombarded p35S:GFP:YFP. After overnight GUS
staining and tissue clearing the number of GUS
stained cells was determined and the percentage of
GUS positive cells relative to the transformed cells
calculated.
In silico analysis of the TRY promoter

To identify transcription factor binding sites the Plant Cisacting Regulatory DNA Elements (PLACE, http://www.dna.
affrc.go.jp/PLACE/) and the TRANSFAC (TFSEARCH:
Searching Transcription Factor Binding Sites (ver 1.3),
http://mbs.cbrc.jp/papia/) databases were used.
