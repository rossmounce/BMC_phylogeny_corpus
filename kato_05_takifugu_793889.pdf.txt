Abstract
Background: The genome sequence of the pufferfish Takifugu rubripes is an enormously useful tool
in the molecular physiology of fish. Euryhaline fish that can survive both in freshwater (FW) and
seawater (SW) are also very useful for studying fish physiology, especially osmoregulation. Recently
we learned that there is a pufferfish, Takifugu obscurus, common name "mefugu" that migrates into
FW to spawn. If T. obscurus is indeed a euryhaline fish and shares a high sequence homology with
T. rubripes, it will become a superior animal model for studying the mechanism of osmoregulation.
We have therefore determined its euryhalinity and phylogenetic relationship to the members of
the Takifugu family.
Results: The following six Takifugu species were used for the analyses: T. obscurus, T. rubripes, T.
niphobles, T. pardalis, T. poecilonotus, and T. porphyreus. When transferred to FW, only T. obscurus
could survive while the others could not survive more than ten days in FW. During this course of
FW adaptation, serum Na+ concentration of T. obscurus decreased only slightly, but a rapid and large
decrease occurred even in the case of T. niphobles, a peripheral fresh water species that is often
seen in brackish river mouths. Phylogenetic analysis using nucleotide sequences of the
mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA gene of each species indicated that the six Takifugu species are
very closely related with each other.
Conclusion: T. obscurus is capable of adapting to both FW and SW. Its genomic sequence shares
a very high homology with those of the other Takifugu species such that the existing Takifugu
genomic information resources can be utilized. These properties make "mefugu", which has drawn
little attention from animal physiologists until this study, a useful model animal for studying the
molecular mechanism of maintaining body fluid homeostasis.

Background
Maintenance of a stable internal environment is important for vertebrate animals to survive in a variety of habi-

tats. Even small changes in ionic balance, osmolarity, and
pH of body fluid seriously affect the survival of the animals. Strategies for maintaining body fluid homeostasis

are different depending on animals and their habitats.
Freshwater (FW) teleosts (modern bony fish) maintain
the osmolarity of extracellular fluid around 300 mOsM,
while the osmolarity of the environmental freshwater is
generally less than 10 mOsM. In order to balance passive
loss of salts and gain of water, they take up salts from FW
through the gills and excrete a lot of dilute urine from
which most of the salts have been reabsorbed by the kidney [1]. Marine teleosts also maintain the osmolarity of
extracellular fluid to a level similar to that of freshwater
fish, despite that the osmolarity of seawater (SW) is
approx. 1000 mOsM. In order to balance passive loss of
water and gain of salts, they drink seawater, absorb salts
and water both in the intestine, and excrete salts through
the gills [1]. The systems used by teleosts to adapt to FW
and SW differ not only in the direction of ion and water

movements but also in their molecular components.
Euryhaline fish adapts to both FW and SW by switching
these systems.
To identify the molecular components involved in body
fluid homeostasis, the change of expression of each gene
during adaptation of euryhaline fishes to different salinities is a potential useful marker since the genes involved
are expected to be drastically up- or down-regulated during the adaptation. In fact, several genes have been identified by this strategy using euryhaline fishes such as tilapia
[2], salmon [3-5], killifish [6], and eel [7-10]. However,
this systematic approach is very laborious because
genome sequences are not available for the euryhaline
fishes that are currently being used for molecular physiological studies.

Takifugu is a genus of puffer fish and belongs to the family
Tetradontidae of teleost fish. It consists of approx. 20 species living in the Northwest Pacific Ocean around China,
Korea, and Japan [11,12]. Takifugu species are famous for
their puffing behavior, powerful toxins in the internal
organs, and edible muscle. Two species are farmed on a
commercial scale: T. rubripes is farmed in Japan and T.
obscurus, in Korea and China. The Takifugu species have an
advantage as animal model, in that they have a short
genome (~400 Mb) compared to those of other vertebrates including Homo sapiens (human, 3000 Mb), Mus
musculus (mouse, 3000 Mb), Gallus gallus (chicken, 1200
Mb), Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog, 3100 Mb), Danio
rerio (zebrafish, 1700 Mb), and Oryzias latipes (medaka,
1100 Mb) [13]. In 2002, the genome project of T. rubripes
was completed and the sequence information is now
available for free on the websites [14].
Within the genus Takifugu, two species are known to be
anadromous, namely, T. obscurus [15-19] and T. ocellatus
[16]. T. obscurus (Figure 1, Table 1) is found in the East
China Sea, the South China Sea, and inland waters in
China and the Korean Peninsula. It lives in the bottom
layer of inshore and inland waters, and grows 20–40 cm
in length. Most of the growth takes place in the sea but
they spawn in brackish and fresh water. During the
spawning season, which is from late spring to early summer, the sexually mature fish run into river estuaries and
spawn in inland waters including rivers, lakes, and ponds.
The fingerlings grow in the inland water and either return
to the sea the next spring or they there for a few months
before returning to the sea. In the sea they grow to sexually
mature fish over several years, and then return to the
inland water again to spawn. T. ocellatus is also found in
an area similar to that of T. obscurus. T. ocellatus is a small
species and grows to around 15 cm in length. The life cycle

of T. ocellatus has not been well described but is expected
to be similar to that of T. obscurus.
In this study, we focus on the suitability of T. obscurus as a
novel animal model for studying the molecular mechanism of body fluid homeostasis. First we compared the
adaptability of T. obscurus to FW with those of other Takifugu species, and showed that only T. obscurus is fully
adaptable to both SW and FW. Next we demonstrated that
changes in blood Na+ concentration of T. obscurus during
FW adaptation are kept within the physiological range
while those of T. niphobles decline beyond the range.
Finally we isolated and sequenced 16S ribosomal genes
from six Takifugu species including T. obscurus, T.
niphobles, and T. rubripes, and demonstrated that those
sequences are 99% identical within the genus Takifugu.
With the euryhalinity and applicability of the currently
available fugu genome sequence, we conclude that T.
obscurus is a useful animal model for studying the mechanism of osmoregulation.

Results
Survival of Takifugu species in FW
A summary on six Takifugu species used in this study is
shown in Figure 1 and Table 1. The survival rate of each
species after transfering from SW to FW is shown in Figure
2A. The results show the mean values of several experiments. The mean survival in FW was: 1.2 ± 0.2 days, 3.6 ±
0.2 days, 5.5 ± 0.4 days, 7.0 ± 0.3, 7.5 ± 0.8 days, and more
than 10 days for T. porphyreus, T. poecilonotus, T. rubripes, T.
niphobles, T. pardalis, and T. obscurus, respectively. In a separate experiment, we confirmed that T. obscurus could survive for at least 3 weeks in FW without any apparent
difficulties (data not shown). These data suggest that only
T. obscurus is fully adaptable to both FW and SW among
the six Takifugu species tested. Of the five species that

T. pardalis, and T. niphobles to FW.
Changes in serum osmolarity and concentrations of ions
and urea during adaptation
To gain insights into the way that the Takifugu species
adapt to different salinities, we sampled the blood from
two species, T. obscurus and T. niphobles, and determined
serum osmolarity and concentrations of ions and urea
(Table 2). In SW, serum osmolarity and ion concentration
of T. obscurus and T. niphobles were similar to those
reported for other teleost fish [1]. When transferred to FW,
however, significant changes were observed in serum
osmolarity and concentrations of Na+ and Cl- for T.

The fishes that survived for 10 days in BW were transferred
to FW and survival was monitored (time course data not
shown). Mean survival in FW were: 3.1 ± 0.6 days, 4.6 ±
0.6 days, and 5.5 ± 0.7 days for T. niphobles (n = 7), T.
poecilonotus (n = 8), and T. pardalis (n = 6), respectively.
Mean survival in FW following the transfer from BW did
not differ significantly between T. poecilonotus and T. pardalis, and was short for T. niphobles (P < 0.001) when compared to the survival of those that were transferred from
SW to FW. These results indicate that 10 days' adaptation

Comparison of nephron structure of Takifugu species
Kidney sections of the six Takifugu species were analyzed
to compare their nephron structures. Under light microscope, a number of glomeruli were observed within all
sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin, demonstrating
that all six Takifugu species have glomerular nephrons
(Figure 4A–C). The glomeruli of FW-acclimated T. obscurus appeared to be loose compared to those of the SWacclimated fish (Figure 4D–E). There was no clear difference between those species rich in glomeruli at the histological level.

The reductions in osmolarity during FW adaptation of T.
obscurus and T. niphobles were -17 and -148 mOsM, respectively. The decrements of serum concentrations of Na+ and
Cl- during FW adaptation were -13 and -16 mM in T.
obscurus, and -69 and -52 mM in T. niphobles, respectively.
These results suggest that T. obscurus has a much stronger
ability to maintain body fluid homeostasis against salinity
fluctuations and can survive in FW.
Figure 3 shows the time course of changes in serum Na+
concentration following exposure of T. obscurus and T.
niphobles to low salinities. In the case of T. obscurus, a
slightly decreased level that was observed on day 1,
remained throughout the course, but in the case of T.
niphobles, a relatively large decrease occurred continuously
until death. In BW where T. niphobles exhibited 64% survival rate (Figure 2), a significant recovery of the decreased
serum Na+ levels was observed on day 9 (Figure 3). The
standard errors of serum Na+ concentration of T. niphobles
(7.6–32 mM) were much larger than those of T. obscurus
(2.3–7.9 mM), suggesting that the individual differences
of adaptability to FW and BW are large in T. niphobles. In
T. niphobles the decrease in serum Cl- was more extensive

To characterize the segments of the renal tubules, kidney
sections of T. obscurus, T. rubripes, T. niphobles, T. pardalis,
and T. poecilonotus were stained with anti-Na+-K+-ATPase
(NKA) antibody, and observed under a fluorescence
microscope. NKA is the most important molecule that
provides a driving force for many transporting systems in
the renal tubules, and the patterns of NKA localization are
different among the segments of renal tubule (Figure 4I–
J) [20]. In both FW- and SW-acclimated T. obscurus, proximal and distal segments were clearly observed (Figure
4F–G). In contrast, the distal segment is not found in T.
rubripes, T. niphobles, T. pardalis, and T. poecilonotus (Figure
4H).
Phylogeny of Takifugu species
To know the phylogenetic relationship of the Takifugu
species, we isolated the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene
from each species and determined the sequence. Resulting
data were compared with the sequences of the 16S rRNA
genes of other species in databases, and a phylogenetic
tree was constructed (Figure 5). Surprisingly, the Takifugu
species were very closely related each other. The identities
of 16S rRNA within the Takifugu species are 99% whereas
those between Takifugu and Tetraodon nigroviridi, Oryzias
latipes, or Homo sapiens were 86%, 77%, and 63%, respectively. Our preliminary results of the nucleotide sequences
of several cDNA clones for ion transporters (Na+/H+
exchangers; accession numbers AB200326–AB200333)
and hormone receptors (members of the adrenomedullin
receptor family: accession numbers AB219765–
AB219771, AB219835–AB219840) [21] of T. obscurus
were 99% identical to those of T. rubripes including the
non-coding sequences (data not shown). These results
suggest that the Takifugu species diversified very recently
and the genome resources of T. rubripes can be used for
studying the T. obscurus genes and their products.

Discussion
Through analyses of the ability of the Takifugu species to
adapt to FW, we have demonstrated that only T. obscurus

exhibits a high adaptability to both FW and SW. This
observation is consistent with their natural anadromous
habitats (Table 1). In our analyses, we used sexually
immature fish (~10 g) and large fish (~350 g) with well
developed testis or ovary. All the T. obscurus survived in
both FW and SW for more than 10 days and they looked
healthy, suggesting that size and sexual maturation do not
affect their adaptability. Recently, Yan et al. reported the
effect of salinity on food intake, growth, and survival of T.
obscurus (~45 g) [19]. They cultured T. obscurus in FW, BW,
and SW for 54 days and compare their level of food-intake
and growth rates. The fish survived and grew under all
conditions tested, and the growth rates in low-salinity BW
(23% SW) were better than those in FW, SW and highsalinity BW (51% SW). Their observation demonstrated
that T. obscurus grows under a wide range of salinities and
low-salinity BW is the best condition for young T. obscurus
to grow.
Our analyses also demonstrated that many other Takifugu
species exhibit a relatively high ability to cope with salinity changes. T. niphobles, T. rubripes, T. pardalis, and T.
poecilonotus can survive in FW for several days and in BW
for more than 10 days, suggesting that the Takifugu species
are potentially euryhaline. These results are consistent
with their natural brackish/marine habitats; they are
sometimes found in brackish river mouths (Table 1). It is
known that T. rubripes spawn in the entrance of bays. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/5/18

fingerlings grow in shallow and river mouths of bays for
one year, and then go to the broad ocean [22]. Han et al.
demonstrated that the best growing salinity of T. rubripes
weighting ~0.02, ~1.2 and ~25 g were 73–91%, 29%, and
43% SW, respectively [23]. Thus change of the environmental salinity is important for the growth of the fingerlings of T. rubripes.
During the acclimation to FW, serum Cl- of T. obscurus
decreased although Na+ and osmolarity remained
unchanged. In T. niphobles the decrease in serum Cl- was
more extensive than that in serum Na+. These results suggest that the mechanisms whereby Cl- and Na+ are regulated differ. The decrease in serum Cl- during FW
acclimation has also been observed in Japanese eel
(Anguilla japonica) [24] and spotted green pufferfish
(Tetraodon nigroviridis) [20]. In Tetraodon and Takifugu species, the other electrolytes that compensate for Cl- were
not determined. In the case of Japanese eel, serum SO42concentration increases from ~1 to ~19 mM during acclimation from SW to FW [24]. The expressions of kidney
sulfate transporters are drastically induced during FW
acclimation, suggesting that the serum SO42- reabsorbed
by the kidney compensates for Cl- and helps improve the
survival of eel in FW [24].
Some reports have categorized pufferfish as aglomerular
[25,26]. However, glomerular nephrons was observed in
the species of from four genuses of the Tetraodontidae
family, namely, Canthigaster rivulatus [27], Tetraodon nigroviridis [20], Sphoeroides testudineus [28], two Takifugu species reported by Ogawa [27], and six Takifugu species in
this study (Figure 4). We think that many of the Tetraodontidae species are glomerular. The increase in size of the
glomerulus after transferring to FW (Figure 4D–E) was
also found in the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus
aculeatus L.) [29]. In general, the largest difference
between FW fish and glomerular SW fish regarding structure of the renal tubules is the presence or absence of a distal segment, which acts as a urine-diluting segment in FW
fish [30]. Most of the euryhaline fish have a FW-fish type
of nephron such as the European eel (Anguilla vulgaris),
Pacific pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), rainbow
trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), southern flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma), armored sculpin (Leptocottus armatus),
medaka (Oryzias latipes), and spotted green pufferfish
[20,30]. In the Takifugu species, we demonstrated that
only mefugu (T. obscurus) has the FW-fish type of nephron
with a distal segment, and the other species have a SW-fish
type of nephron lacking a distal segment (Figure 4F–J).
These results are completely consistent with the ability of
those species to adapt to FW, thus the presence of a distal
segment is one of the most important factors that allow T.
obscurus to be highly adaptalbe to a wide range of salinities.

Tetraodon nigroviridis (spotted green pufferfish) is a small
pufferfish less than 10 cm in length that lives in brackish
river and estuaries of Southeast Asia. T. nigroviridis also
has a compact genome like the Takifugu species, and the
whole genome was sequenced in 2004 [31]. Recently, Lin
et al. have demonstrated the strong adaptability of T.
nigroviridis to FW, BW, and SW and its use in studies on
osmoregulation [20]. We think that both T. nigroviridis
and T. obscurus are good models for studying osmoregulation. The advantage with T. nigroviridis is that it is readily
available. The advantage with T. obscurus is that it can be
used in a wide range of size (2–20 cm) and compare the
functions of the gill and kidney with those of other Takifugu species that can not adapt to FW.
Many molecules have been identified as components of
the chloride cells (or mitochondria-rich cells), the major
site of ion regulation in the gill: transporters, channels,
and pumps for Na+, K+, Cl-, HCO3-, H+, Ca2+, water, and
urea; carbonic anhydrase; and hormone receptors [32].
However, the complete physiological function of the
chloride cells cannot be explaned by those components
alone, and identification of further players is necessary.
Furthermore, little is known of the molecular biology of
osmoregulation by the kidney and intestine of teleost fish:
NKA [20], sulphate transporters [24], urea transporter
[33], chloride channel [34], Ca2+-sensing receptor [35], Vtype H+-ATPases [36] in the kidney; Na-Pi cotransporter
[37] and aquaporin water channels in both the kidney
and intestine [38-40]; and Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter in
the stomach and intestine [41]. By determining the differences in gene expression patterns in the gill, intestine, and
kidney of FW- and SW-acclimated mefugu (T. obscurus),
we would be able to identify the genes that are important
for osmoregulatory adaptation.

Conclusion
• Mefugu (T. obscurus) is an anadromous fish of the genus
Takifugu that has a strong ability to maintain body fluid
homeostasis during adaptation to low and high environmental salinities and is fully adaptable to both FW and
SW.
• Members of the genus Takifugu are very closely related
and share ~99% sequence identities in their genomes as
shown by a phylogenetic analysis using the mitochondrial
DNA sequence for the 16S ribosomal RNA gene.
• The nephrons of FW- or SW-acclimated T. obscurus
exhibit a structure that is typical of FW fish. On the other
hand, T. rubripes, T. niphobles, T. pardalis, T. poecilonotus,
and T. porphyreus have nephrons of that are typical of SW
glomerular fish.

• T. obscurus can be used as an animal model for studying
the molecular mechanism of osmoregulation by exploiting the Takifugu genome resources.

Methods
Animals and transfer experiment
The animal protocols and procedures were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
Tokyo Institute of Technology and conformed to the
American Physiological Society's Guiding Principles in the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. T. obscurus (10–350 g)
were cultured in a brackish river in Korea and China. The
fish cultured in BW (14% SW) were transported to The
Shimonoseki Marine Science Museum in Japan and kept
in 150–2000-l tanks containing BW. The fish were then
acclimated to SW for 7–14 days. None of the fish died during the acclimation to SW. To determe FW adaptability,
the SW in the tank was gradually replaced with FW by
pouring FW at a speed that allowed a complete replacement after 1–2 h. Some fish were transferred to FW
directly. Survival was then monitored every 12 h for 10
days.

Other species were caught or cultured in seawater. T.
rubripes (30–4200 g) were cultured and sampled at the
Japan Sea. T. niphobles (18–128 g), T. pardalis (29–175 g),
T. poecilonotus (18–43 g), and T. porphyreus (521–1000 g)
were sampled at the Japan Sea. They were transported to
the Aquarium and kept in 200–5700-l tanks containing
SW. Their adaptability to FW and BW were determined as
described above.
All fish used in the analyses were adult fish. The normal
size of each species is shown in Table I. Most of the T.
niphobles, T. pardalis, T. poecilonotus, and T. porphyreus were
sexually mature adult fish. T. obscurus and T. rubripes were
mixtures of mature and immature fish. The distinction
between the species was performed according to Nakabo
[11].
Blood analyses
T. obscurus and T. niphobles were maintained in SW and
transferred to FW or BW (14% SW). Bloods were collected
from the fish in SW and those in FW or BW after 1, 3, and
9 days of the transfer. Healthy fish that had adapted to in
various conditions were anaesthetized by immersion in
0.1% ethyl m-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate, and
blood was collected from the hepatic vein or heart. Serum
from T. obscurus and T. niphobles were diluted in water at
the ratio of 1:2 and 1:8, respectively, and used for the analyses. Serum osmolarity was measured by a cryoscopic
method. Concentrations of Na+, K+, and Cl- were measured by the established electrode methods. Ca2+ and Mg2+
concentrations were determined by the o-cresolphthalein
complexone method and xylysine blue method, respec-

tively. Urea nitrogen concentration in the serum was
measured by standard urease assay. The dilution of serum
in water did not affect the results (data not shown). These
measurements were conducted by SRL Laboratories
(Tokyo, Japan).
Histochemistry
Kidneys of pufferfish were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, embedded in paraffin,
sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin
according to standard procedures.

For the immunohisotchemical analyses, the kidneys were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer,
pH 7.4, at 4°C for 2 h, and rinsed in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS: 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 6.5 mM
Na2HPO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 10% (w/
v) sucrose. The fixed tissues were cryoprotected through a
range of increasing sucrose concentrations up to 20%,
quick frozen in an optimum cutting temperature compound (Tissue Tek).
The frozen sections (6 µm) and paraffin-embedded sections (6 µm) were prepared, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS at 20°C for 10 min, incubated with 5%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) in PBS at 20°C for 1 h, and incubated with anti-Na+-K+-ATPase rabbit antiserum [8]
(1:1,000) in PBS containing 5% FBS at 20°C for 8 h. After
washing with PBS, the sections were incubated with a mixture of Alexa Fluor-488- or Alexa Fluor-546-labeled secondary antibody (Molecular Probes; 1:2,000 dilution),
Alexa Fluor-488-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes;
0.15 µM), and Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes; 100 ng/
ml) in PBS containing 5% FBS at 20°C for 1 h. The sections were mounted on antifade glycerol (90% glycerol,
10% 10 × PBS, and 0.1% 1,4-phenylenediamine, pH 7.4).
Fluorescence was detected using a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). The images were obtained with a highresolution digital charge-coupled device (CCD) camera
(AxioCam HRm, Carl Zeiss) and processed with an AxioVision 4.1 software (Carl Zeiss).
The following pufferfish were used for the analyses: T.
obscurus acclimated to FW for 9 days; T. obscurus acclimated to SW for 9 days; T. rubripes, T. niphobles, T. pardalis,
T. poecilonotus, and T. porphyreus maintained in SW.
Phylogenetic analyses
Mitochondrial DNA from T. obscurus, T. rubripes, T.
niphobles, T. pardalis, T. poecilonotus, and T. porphyreus was
extracted from the fin, and used for isolation of genes for
16S rRNA by PCR as described elsewhere [42]. Two sets of
primers were used: L1854 (5'-AAACCTCGTACCTTTTGCAT-3') and H2582 (5'-ATTGCGCTACCTTTGCACGGT3') for amplification of the anterior half of the 16S rRNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/5/18

genes, and L2503 (5'-CACAAGCCTCGCCTGTTTACCA3') and H3058 (5'-TCCGGTCTGAACTCAGATCACGTA3') for the amplification of the posterior half. Products of
PCR were purified and directly sequenced by the dideoxy
chain termination method with an automated DNA
sequencer (Model 310; Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). The GenBank accession number for the sequence of
each gene is as follows: T. niphobles, AB199318; T.
poecilonotus, AB199319; T. pardalis, AB199320; T. rubripes,
AB199321; T. obscurus, AB199322; and T. porphyreus,
AB199323.
For the evolutionary analyses, the nucleotide sequences
were aligned using Clustal W software [43], and then a
phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining
method [44] using MEGA software [45] based on JukesCantor evolutionary distances [44]. Statistical analysis
was performed by bootstrap methods [44].
