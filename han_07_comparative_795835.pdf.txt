Abstract
Background: Environmental modulation of gene expression in Yersinia pestis is critical for its life
style and pathogenesis. Using cDNA microarray technology, we have analyzed the global gene
expression of this deadly pathogen when grown under different stress conditions in vitro.
Results: To provide us with a comprehensive view of environmental modulation of global gene
expression in Y. pestis, we have analyzed the gene expression profiles of 25 different stress
conditions. Almost all known virulence genes of Y. pestis were differentially regulated under
multiple environmental perturbations. Clustering enabled us to functionally classify co-expressed
genes, including some uncharacterized genes. Collections of operons were predicted from the
microarray data, and some of these were confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR). Several regulatory DNA motifs, probably recognized by the regulatory protein
Fur, PurR, or Fnr, were predicted from the clustered genes, and a Fur binding site in the
corresponding promoter regions was verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).
Conclusion: The comparative transcriptomics analysis we present here not only benefits our
understanding of the molecular determinants of pathogenesis and cellular regulatory circuits in Y.
pestis, it also serves as a basis for integrating increasing volumes of microarray data using existing
methods.

Background
Yersinia pestis is the etiological agent of plague, alternatively growing in fleas or warm-blood mammals [1]. Fleas
acquire this organism via blood meal from a bacteremic
mammal, usually a rodent. To produce a transmissible
infection, Y. pestis colonizes the flea midgut and forms a
biofilm in the proventricular valve optimally at 20 to
26°C, blocking its normal blood feeding [2]. Human

beings are occasionally infected by directly contacting
infected animals or by being bitten by the blocked fleas.
Thus, Y. pestis must experience a temperature shift during
the transmission process between rodents, fleas, and
humans. It is considered a facultative intracellular pathogen. After the initial subcutaneous invasion, the bacteria
migrate into the regional lymph nodes via the subcutaneous lymph vessel. Most of the organisms that invade the

lymph nodes are engulfed and killed by the polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) that are attracted to invasion
sites in large numbers. However, a few bacilli are taken up
by tissue macrophages, providing a fastidious and unoccupied niche for Y. pestis to synthesize virulence determinants [3]. Residence in this niche also facilitates the
bacteria's resistance to phagocytosis [4,5]. The moiety
escaped from macrophages can multiply outside of host
cells and eventually cause systemic infection. The hypothesized prevailing conditions of phagolysosomal microenvironments include acidic pH, oxidative stress, iron
scavenging, nutrition limitation, and killing or inhibiting
activities of antibacterial peptides. To survive these stressful environments, Y. pestis likely makes appropriate adaptive responses, primarily reflected by the transcriptional
changes of specific sets of genes.
A DNA microarray is able to determine simultaneous
changes in all the genes of a cell at the mRNA level [6]. We
and others have measured the gene expression profiles of
Y. pestis in response to a variety of stimulating conditions
(stimulon analysis), including temperature alteration tolerance [7-9], increased osmolarity [10], ion deficiency
[11], antibiotic treatment [12,13], oxidative and acidic
stresses [14], antibacterial peptide treatment [14] and
nutrition limitation. We also identified the regulons controlled by each of the regulatory proteins, Fur [11], PhoP
[15], OmpR, and OxyR, by comparing the gene expression
patterns of the mutant transcriptional regulator with that
of its parental strain. In order to acquire more regulatory
information, all available microarray data of Y. pestis
including those published signature expression profiles
[8-13,15] were collected and subjected to clustering analysis, which infers functionality to the clusters of co-regulated genes.
The transcriptional and genomic information gleaned
from coordinately regulated genes was also used to computationally search for potential operons (operon prediction) and cis-acting DNA regulatory motifs (motif
discovery). Some important findings were further verified
by biochemical experiments, including RT-PCR and gel
shift assays. This analysis provides an opportunity to gain
a global view of environmental modulation of gene
expression patterns in Y. pestis.

Results and Discussion
Comprehensive analysis of large sets of microarray expression data is useful to dissect bacterial adaptation to various environments and to understand bacterial gene
transcriptional regulation [16,17]. For example, Kendall
and his colleagues have compared the general responses
of Mycobacterium tuberculosis induced by a variety of different in vitro conditions (low pH, low nutrients, nitrogen,
oxygen stress, stationary phase, and nutrition starvation)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/96

[18]. After the determination of the CsrA, SlyA, and
PhoPQ regulons in Samonella typhimurium, the relevant
regulon members are monitored to define the synergetic
or antagonistic roles between these three regulators in cell
infection models [16].
Recently, many signature expression profiles of Y. pestis
have been reported [7-13,15,19-21]. All the microarray
expression data from our laboratory were analyzed using
standardized microarray procedures such that they are
suitable for comprehensive analysis. Comparative transcriptomics analysis presented here can be used to mine
the regulatory information from these available microarray data, providing an opportunity to gain a global view
on environmental modulation of gene expression in Y.
pestis. This analysis provides an additional dividend
towards the transcriptional regulatory networks of Y. pestis.
Virulence genes in response to multiple environmental
stresses
In this work, 25 expression profiles of Y. pestis were collected for further integration. We hypothesize that the
stress conditions used in these experiments will be
encountered by this bacterium during its infection and life
cycle. The data supported the notion that Y. pestis has
evolved its ability to coordinately regulate a wide set of
genes to survive a wide range of environmental perturbations. Almost all of the known virulence genes were active
in the stress responses. Thus, identification of the expression patterns of virulence genes upon a wide set of environmental changes will provide a reference to screen for
uncharacterized genes that shown the same differential
gene expression under the same stressful conditions.

The transmission and infection of Y. pestis can be roughly
divided into stages of maintain in fleas, adhesion to host
surface, invasion into epithelial or endothelial cells, intracellular growth, antiphagocytosis, and extracellular proliferation (Figure 1). Y. pestis possesses a set of virulence
determinants that promote infection in mammalian hosts
and/or transmission by flea vectors, and different virulence genes have been proven or proposed to be involved
in different infection stages (reviewed in [1,22]).
As described previously, expression profiles of Y. pestis
showed that almost all the putative virulence genes of Y.
pestis were differentially regulated upon temperature alteration [7-9]. Our data showed that Y. pestis known virulence genes also respond to other environmental stresses
besides temperature shift (Figure 1). For example, the
hemin storage locus, hmsHFRS [23], was repressed by
temperature upshift, high osmolarity, nutrition limitation, and streptomycin treatment. The ymt gene encoding

Yersinia murine toxin [24] was also regulated by temperature upshift and streptomycin treatment.
Y. pestis synthesizes several antiphagocytic factors, including F1 capsular antigen [25], pH6 antigen [4] and Yersinia
outer proteins (Yops) [26]. Expression of Yops was regulated by temperature alteration, increased osmolarity, and
nutrition deficiency under normal Ca2+ condition. These
data suggest that the low-calcium response of type III
secretion system (T3SS) appears to be triggered at the
mRNA level by other environmental cues in addition to
temperature upshift and Ca2+ limitation. F1 capsular antigen is expressed much more at 37°C than at 26°C [27].
pH6 antigen (PsaA), encoded by the chromosomal psaA

gene, expresses in vitro between pH 5 and 6.7 at 35 to
41°C [28], or when bacteria live within phagocytic
phagolysome [29]. The psaEFABC operon encodes a chaperone/usher pathway involved in the secretion and assembly of pH6 antigen as a polymer (fimbriae) on the surface
of Y. pestis in macrophages [28,30]. PsaE is thought to be
a positive regulator of the psaABC locus and is required for
maximal expression of the pH6 antigen [31]. A recent
study showed that the psaEFABC locus is regulated by
RovA [32]. The microarray data showed that the F1
operon was upregulated upon temperature upshift, low
pH medium, oxidative stress, low Mg2+, and nutrition
deficiency, while the psaEFABC locus was induced by temperature alteration, acid stress, low Mg2+, nutrition limita-

tion, high salinity and hyperosmotic stress. It is
reasonable to assume that synergetic operation of complicated microenvironments within mammalian hosts
account for the full expression of these two loci.
Prediction of operons from microarray data
Operon prediction is the first step toward elucidating gene
regulation and reconstructing regulatory networks. Most
approaches for prokaryotic operon prediction were developed on the basis of genomic and/or phylogenetic information [33]. For these methods, training with
experimental information of known operons is required
to generate the predictors. However, little experimental
data of operon structure is currently available for Y. pestis.
To predict the potential operons of Y. pestis, we attempted
a method that incorporated the empirical correlation
coefficient from microarray expression data with the
genomic annotation data, including gene orientation,
intergenic distance, functional similarity, and intragenome conservation.
Stress-responsive operons predicted from microarray
expression data
By using the criteria described in Methods, we identified
39 potential operons that consisted of 183 genes in Y. pestis (Table 1). Nineteen of these potential operons have
been previously studied in other bacteria. There was good
agreement between our results and a recent report in
which the adjacent genes of Y. pestis CO92 are predicted
to be within an operon based on the greater conservation
of operons in multiple species [33].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/96

many bioinformatics tools available for predicting operons, results presented here demonstrated a new reliable
strategy for operon prediction and verification, which will
be helpful for functional studies. However, only a small
number of operons could be predicted, due to the fact i)
that only stress-responsive genes were included for this
analysis, and ii) that a lot of contiguous gene pairs passed
the criteria, but incomplete array data made it difficult to
define the border of their primary mRNA transcripts (for
example, the extension of a predicted operon, YPO08810882 to YPO0881-0884, was demonstrated by RT-PCR as
shown in Figure 2d)
Functional inference of clustering, uncharacterized genes
Clustering microarray expression data can be viewed as a
data reduction process, in that observations of gene
expression in each cluster can be over-represented (Figure
3). This process provides much greater insight into functional classes of co-expressed genes, since genes that are
functionally related should be co-regulated and consequently should show similar expression profiles [34,35].
Thus, clustering genes with similar expression patterns
can potentially be utilized to predict the functions of gene
products with unknown functions, and to identify sets of
genes that are co-expressed and may play the same roles in
different cell cycles. We analyzed the expression data with
unsupervised algorithms and identified four clusters of
co-expressed genes that were associated with ribosome
biosynthesis, iron/heme assimilation, and sulfur and
energy metabolism. The possible roles of uncharacterized
genes may be inferred by referencing other members in
each cluster.

Verification of predicted operons by RT-PCR
Four predicted operons were chosen for validation by RTPCR (Figure 2). Given that genes in an operon are
expressed to a single mRNA molecule, reverse transcriptase was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA that
was subsequently used as template for PCR. Products were
analyzed from the beginning, middle, and end of a multigene cluster, so as to define where the multi-gene cluster
transcript starts and ends. For the operons, YPO19941996 (Figure 2a), katY-cybC-cybB (Figure 2b), and
YPO1087-1088 (Figure 2c) analyzed, there was perfect
consistency with the above in silico prediction. Microarray
analysis showed that YPO0881 and YPO0882 were coexpressed, but due to low-quality data it failed to provide
the expression data of their downstream genes, YPO0883
and YPO0884. RT-PCR demonstrated that all these four
genes were expressed as a single mRNA molecule (Figure
2d), and thus they constituted an operon.

Cluster I consisted of more than 70 genes, most of which
are functionally related to biosynthesis of ribosomal proteins. The ribosome is the factory of protein synthesis, and
it determines the capacity of the cell to synthesize proteins, thus determining the growth rate of the bacteria.
Since most of the members in Cluster I were down-regulated in response to a temperature shift from 26 to 37°C,
high osmolarity, Mg2+ limitation, nutrition deficiency,
and antibiotics treatment, Y. pestis appeared to slow its
growth rate under these conditions (see Additional File
1).

This analysis predicted a total of 39 operons in Y. pestis.
The advantage of our strategy is that a high accuracy rate
would be achieved by integrating microarray experimental data with genomic information. Although there are

Cluster II contains dozens of genes involved in iron/heme
assimilation. It is noticeable that almost all of these genes
in this cluster were upregulated in response to iron scavenging in wild type (WT) strain, and to iron excess in fur

Clustering analysis and functional classification of coexpressed gene clusters
Clustering analysis of the whole microarray dataset was
analyzed and four distinct clusters of co-expressed genes,
cluster I, II, III, and IV, were identified (Figure 3).

in aerobic respiration. The microarray data showed that
these energy metabolism-related genes were down-regulated upon heat shock, high osmolarity, Mg2+ limitation,
and streptomycin treatment, but they were upregulated
upon chloramphenicol treatment. These results indicated
a general retardation of energy generation in Y. pestis
might occur in response to these suboptimal growth conditions.

Sulfur is one of the nutrients necessary for bacterial life.
Genes responsible for sulfur uptake and utilization constitute the cys regulon in Gram-negative bacteria [41]. Cluster III contains members of the cys regulon, including
tauABCD, ssuEADCB, cysPUWAM, and sbp1. These genes
were regulated by most of the environmental stresses
under study, implying that sulfur metabolism might play
important roles in the adaptation of Y. pestis to various
environmental perturbations. Two genomic loci,
YPO1316-1319 and YPO4108-4111, are also included in
this sulfur-metabolism-related cluster. Most of the gene
products within these two loci were annotated as conserved hypothetical proteins. These two genomic loci
might have functions related to sulfur metabolism.

Prediction of regulatory DNA motifs from clustering data
Functionally related members within a cluster of coexpressed genes are likely to be regulated by similar mechanisms; sometimes expression of these genes is even controlled by a single regulatory protein. Promoter DNA
sequences containing short (5–20 bp) and relatively conserved regulatory DNA motifs represent the predominant
contact sites with the regulatory protein. In this study, the
promoter-proximate DNA sequences were collected from
each cluster of co-expressed genes. The subsequent motif
discovery analysis indicated the presence of DNA motifs
that resembled the experimentally proved Fur, PurR, CRP,
and Fnr boxes of E. coli and other bacteria [42-46], respectively.

As shown in cluster IV in Figure 3, sdhCDAB and sucABCD
involved in tricarboxylic acid cycle had an expressional
pattern similar to that of nuoA-N and cyoABCDE involved

Computational discovery of regulatory DNA motifs

genes are likely regulated by similar mechanisms, and

even share common cis-regulatory DNA elements within
their promoter DNA regions. The presence of a motif-like
sequence within the upstream region of a gene suggests
that it is likely a direct target of the corresponding regulatory protein.
Here, collections of upstream DNA sequences from each
of the above four clusters were searched for potential regulatory motifs (Table 3). DNA boxes were found in the
promoter regions of each collection. A 16 basepair (bp)
box (5'-ACGCAATCGTTTTCNT-3') was detected in the
upstream DNA regions of the cluster I genes. It is very similar to the E. coli PurR box (5'-ANGMAAACGTTTNCGTK3') [47]. A 21 bp box (5'-TGATAATGATTATCATTATCA-3')
was found for the 19 genes in cluster II. It is a 10-1-10
inverted repeat that resembles the E. coli Fur box (5'GATAATGATAATCATTATC-3') [44]. A 15 bp box (5'TGANNNNNNTCAA-3') was found within the upstream
regions of the cluster III genes. It is a part of the E. coli Fnr
box (5'-AAWTTGATNWMNATCAAWWWW-3') [45].
A box sequence (5'-TGAN6TCA-3') was strictly present in
the promoter regions of 14 genes in cluster IV. It is a part
of the binding boxes of CRP [43] and Fnr [45]. Previous
DNA-binding studies showed that CRP bound to exactly
the same sequence as that recognized by Fnr [42]. The
ArcA regulator can recognize a relatively conservative
sequence (5'-GTTAATTAA-3') [46]. An ArcA-box-like
sequence (5'-GTTAATTAATGT-3') was found in the
upstream sequence of 7 genes in cluster IV (Table 3).
In addition to the DNA boxes mentioned above that
described the regulatory motifs with a contiguous oligo-

nucleotide, we constructed their corresponding positionspecific scoring matrix (PSSM; related to a table of probabilistic score of observing nucleotides at each position of
aligned sites) (Figure 4).
EMSA analysis of Fur binding
The above motif discovery analysis showed that there
were Fur-box-like sequences found in the promoter
regions of many genes in cluster II (see Table 3). The presence of a sequence with high similarity with Fur box is a
predictor of Fur-specific binding. To validate the motif
discovery results, eight genes/operons (yfuABC, exbBD,
yiuABCR, YPO3340, YPO0988, nrdHIEF, YPO1735, sufABCDSE) were chosen from cluster II, covering all three
categories shown in Table 2. EMSA (electrophoretic
mobility shift assay) was performed to evaluate the binding of Fur to the upstream promoter DNA. Each promoter
region was radioactively labeled, incubated with purified
His-Fur protein, and then subjected to native gel electrophoresis. The band of free promoter DNA disappears with
the increasing amounts of His-Fur protein, and a DNA
band with decreased mobility appears, presumably representing the Fur-DNA complex. Thus, the Fur protein binds
to the promoter region of each gene/operon tested in vitro
(Figure 5), indicating that the Fur regulator directly controls the expression of these eight genes/operons.

Conclusion
The comprehensive transcriptomics analysis benefits our
understanding of the molecular determinants of bacterial
pathogenesis and cellular regulatory circuits. Our study
gave some hints to the possible function of uncharacterized genes and regulatory elements of Y. pestis such as

operons and DNA regulatory motifs. This kind of analysis
would provide an opportunity to gain a global view of
environmental modulation of gene expression patterns in
Y. pestis, which also serve as a basis for integrating increasing volumes of microarray data using existing methods.

Methods
Collection of microarray expression data
Table 4 lists all the expression profiles of Y. pestis in
response to various environmental perturbations. Y. pestis
strain 201, avirulent to humans, belonging to a newly
established biovar, Microtus [48], was grown at 26°C in a
chemically defined TMH medium [49] to the middle
exponential growth phase (A620 nm approximately 0.8).
Cell cultures were diluted 1:20 in fresh TMH medium, and
the cells were grown for at least 10 generations at 26°C
until reaching A620 nm of approximately 0.8 (26°C cell cultures). If necessary, the cultures were transformed to 37°C
for 1 hr (37°C cell cultures). Bacterial cells were then
exposed to different in vitro stresses (Table 4), and cells
were subsequently harvested for RNA isolation. The
genome-wide transcriptional changes upon the environ-

mental perturbations were monitored by the standard
dual-fluorescent hybridization method with a Y. pestis
whole-genome DNA microarray spotted with PCR-amplified ORFs [8-10]. For the stimulon analysis, the gene
expression pattern of WT strain grown under a stimulating
condition was compared with that of an unperturbed control. For the regulon analysis, we compared the expression
profiles of deletion mutant strains of the target regulator
to WT strain. Y. pestis mutants were engineered by replacing the gene targeted for deletion with a Kmr encoding cassette via λ-red phage homologous recombination as
described previously [11,15].
For microarray hybridization, two independent bacterial
cultures for each growth condition were prepared as biological replicates for RNA isolation. Three separate labeled
probes were made for each RNA preparation as technical
replicates. Pairwise comparisons were made using dye
swaps to avoid labeling bias.
Whole-genome DNA microarray spotted with 4,005 ORFs
was used in our study as described in our previous publi-

cations. The data filtering, normalization and significance
analysis were done as described previously [9,10]. After
filtering the corrupted or suspicious spots during the
image analysis phase, expression data of approximately
50%~80% of Y. pestis genes on array are available in each
array experiment. All the transcriptome data were collected and displayed as a 4,005 × 25 matrix for all the transcriptional changes of 4,005 genes of Y. pestis in response
to 25 environmental perturbations (see Additional File 2).
All the microarray data was deposited in Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO accession number GSE9279).
Operon prediction
To measure similarities in gene transcriptional regulation,
we calculated the correlation coefficient (r) of neighboring genes between mRNA transcriptional patterns under
multiple environmental conditions. We then further
focused our analysis to those genes across all arrays that

[15]
[11]

were differentially regulated in at least five experiments.
All the analysis was based on the use of log2-ratio of
expression values: let xi and yi be the log-ratio of fluorescence intensities for a pair of neighboring genes in experiment i, where n is the number of experiments; n = 25. For
each pair of genes, we calculated the Pearson correlation
coefficient, r, between mRNA expression profiles as follows:
Genes were assigned to a potential operon if they met the
following criterions: i) the correlation coefficient, r, of
neighboring genes was greater than 0.90; ii) they are transcribed in the same direction and are located on the same
strand; iii) intergenic distance between two adjacent genes
was shorter than 300 bp and iv) they are functionally
linked based on the genomic annotation and/or related
publications.

Verification of predicted operons by RT-PCR
According to the microarray data, genes tested in operon
validation were significantly regulated under the growth
temperatures of 26°C, 37°C and 45°C. Therefore, RNA
was extracted from cells grown at these three temperatures, as done in microarray experiments. Primer pairs
were designed for each adjacent gene studied, such that a
PCR amplicon across the intergenic region of the two
genes would be produced when genomic DNA was used
as template (see Additional File 3). cDNA was prepared by
reverse transcription with 5 µg of RNA, 200 U of Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
and 3 µg of random hexamer primers. A sample of the
resulting cDNA (5 µl) was used for PCR amplification.
PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. To ensure that there was no contamination of genomic
DNA, negative controls were performed using RT products
with no addition of reverse transcriptase. Reactions containing primer pairs without cDNA template were also
included as blank controls.
Clustering analysis
Genes were clustered according to their expression patterns in the twenty-five different experiments using Cluster 3.0 software [50]. Before clustering, genes with
expression data in less than three experiments were
removed in order to limit the effects of missing values in
the clustering analyses. Of the original 4005 probes, the
remaining 3339 probes were used for further clustering
analysis. For the original and the filtered data, self-organizing map (SOM) program first ran on the whole microarray dataset to cluster the genes based on the similarity of
their expression profiles. The output files were then processed by hierarchical clustering by using the average linkage method. Correlation coefficients of more than 0.6
were arbitrarily extracted and visualized with TreeView
[50] to graphically display the data by coloring each cell
on the basis of the fluorescence ratio. Cells with log ratios
of 0 (no change in gene expression) are colored in black;
increasing values of positive and negative log ratios are
labeled with increasing intensities of red and green,
respectively.
Discovery of regulatory DNA motifs
For each cluster of co-expressed genes, neighboring genes
were grouped into potential operon structures as
described above. Promoter-proximate DNA sequences
(400 bp upstream to 50 bp downstream of the start codon
of each single-gene transcriptional unit, or the first gene of
each operon) were retrieved from the genomic sequence
of Y. pestis 91001 with the retrieve-sequence tool [51]. Collections of promoter sequences from co-expressed genes
within each cluster were searched for potential regulatory
DNA motifs with the multiple expectation maximization
for motif elicitation (MEME) program [52].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/96

10–30 bases of a single motif and at least 3 distinct motifs
in each run were specified. The first two significant (low Evalue) motifs except AT-rich motifs were chosen for further analysis. The symmetrical or dyad elements were
preferentially selected. Then, the sequence logos were
built by compilation of the conserved sequences detected
in the analysis for each motif with the WebLogo program
[53]. Finally, PSSM for each DNA motif were built with
the consensus and convert-matrix tools [51].
Gel mobility shift analysis of Fur binding
The entire coding region of the fur gene of Y. pestis strain
201 was cloned into pET28a (Novagen, San Diego, CA).
Recombinant plasmids encoding a His-Fur fusion protein
were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells.
Expression of His-Fur was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG). The recombinant protein
was purified under native conditions with a QIAexpressionist™ Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The purified, eluted protein was concentrated to
approximately 0.3 mg ml-1 with the Amicon Ultra-15
(Millipore, Billerica, MA). The purity of His-Fur protein
was verified by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Primers were designed to
amplify the 400–500 bp promoter-proximate region
extending upstream from the start codon of each first gene
of the operons tested (Table S2 for list of oligonucleotide
primers used in this study). EMSA was performed using
the Gel Shift Assay Systems (Promega, Madison, WI). The
DNA was 5'end-labeled using [γ-32P] ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. DNA binding was performed in a 10 µl
reaction volume containing: binding buffer [100 µM
MnCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.05 mg ml-1 poly-(dI-dC)], labeled
DNA (1000–2000 c.p.m. µl-1), and increasing amounts of
His-Fur protein. We included two control reactions: one
contained the specific DNA competitor (unlabeled promoter DNA), while the other was the nonspecific protein
competitor [rabbit anti-F1-protein polyclonal antibody
(IgG)]. After incubation at room temperature for 30 minutes (min), the products were loaded onto a native 4%
(w/v) polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed in 0.5 ×
Tris-borate (TB) buffer containing 100 µM MnCl2 for 30
min at 220 V. Radioactive species were detected by autoradiography.
