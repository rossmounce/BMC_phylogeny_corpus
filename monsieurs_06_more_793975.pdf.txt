Abstract
Background: Several motif detection algorithms have been developed to discover
overrepresented motifs in sets of coexpressed genes. However, in a noisy gene list, the number of
genes containing the motif versus the number lacking the motif might not be sufficiently high to
allow detection by classical motif detection tools. To still recover motifs which are not significantly
enriched but still present, we developed a procedure in which we use phylogenetic footprinting to
first delineate all potential motifs in each gene. Then we mutually compare all detected motifs and
identify the ones that are shared by at least a few genes in the data set as potential candidates.
Results: We applied our methodology to a compiled test data set containing known regulatory
motifs and to two biological data sets derived from genome wide expression studies. By executing
four consecutive steps of 1) identifying conserved regions in orthologous intergenic regions, 2)
aligning these conserved regions, 3) clustering the conserved regions containing similar regulatory
regions followed by extraction of the regulatory motifs and 4) screening the input intergenic
sequences with detected regulatory motif models, our methodology proves to be a powerful tool
for detecting regulatory motifs when a low signal to noise ratio is present in the input data set.
Comparing our results with two other motif detection algorithms points out the robustness of our
algorithm.
Conclusion: We developed an approach that can reliably identify multiple regulatory motifs
lacking a high degree of overrepresentation in a set of coexpressed genes (motifs belonging to
sparsely connected hubs in the regulatory network) by exploiting the advantages of using both
coexpression and phylogenetic information.

Background
Several motif detection algorithms have been developed
to discover overrepresented motifs in sets of coexpressed

genes (for instance [1-8]). The rationale behind these
methodologies is that a set of genes regulated by the same
transcription factor should contain in their intergenic
Page 1 of 15

regions motifs that are statistically overrepresented as
compared to their occurrences in unrelated sequences.
These methodologies have proven to be useful in many
applications (for instance [9-12]). However, usually their
performance rapidly drops as the signal to noise ratio
(defined as the number of sequences that actually contain
the motif versus the number of sequences lacking the
motif) in the data set decreases [13,14]. This drop in performance is also evident in an assessment study of 13 different computational de novo motif detection tools, where
the number of correct motifs retrieved was very low in sets
of noisy data [15]. However, noisy data is mostly the case
encountered in sequence sets derived from genome wide
expression profiles, such as microarrays. The high noise
level in such sequence sets comes as a result of the processing of the microarray data (for instance, the filtering and
clustering procedures used), as well as the nature of the
biological processes in the cell itself. For instance, when
comparing mRNA expression between a wild type and a
regulator knock out strain, besides the direct targets of the
regulator, indirect targets are also affected in their mRNA
expression in the knock out. In such mutants the complete regulatory network acting downstream of the
mutated regulator is disturbed. Lists of genes derived from
these experiments contain targets of more than one regulatory protein lowering the relative overrepresentation of
a particular motif
In order to get over this problem, we have developed an
approach that exploits orthology information besides
coexpression, to discover de novo motifs. Orthology information is introduced by phylogenetic footprinting which
is based on the assumption that among phylogenetically
related species, the regulating sequences in the upstream
regions of orthologous genes are selectively conserved by
evolution. Phylogenetic footprinting has been used for
the detection of motifs with relative success [16-23]. In
these approaches, however, the orthology information is
only used within a set of orthologous intergenic regions to
create motif models. Recently, a number of algorithms
were developed that permit for the mutual comparison of
the motif models derived from different sets of orthologous intergenic regions, followed by the clustering of the
conserved regions that share the same regulatory motif. In
one approach, Jensen et al. [24] applied phylogenetic
footprinting using Gibbs Sampling and then grouped the
conserved regions using a Bayesian clustering algorithm.
A similar way of clustering motif models derived from
phylogenetic footprinting was developed by Qin et al.
[25] and Van Nimwegen et al. [26]. Another approach is
developed by Wang and Stormo [27], where conserved
regulatory regions were detected using Wconsensus [5]
and where the regions sharing the same regulatory motif
were clustered by gradually merging motif models of different orthologous sets (PhyloCon). In their recent paper,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/160

Wang and Stormo [28] used a different clustering
approach; they would first align the models and consequently cluster them according to their alignment scores
(PhyloNet). Our methodology is a combination of Gibbs
Sampling-based phylogenetic footprinting, with two-step
clustering (first aligning motif models, then clustering
based on the alignment score). For phylogenetic footprinting, we developed a new algorithm called BlockSampler, which is an extension of the Gibbs Sampling-based
MotifSampler [2], optimized towards phylogenetic footprinting. For the alignment of the different motif models
returned from BlockSampler, we developed a second algorithm called BlockAligner, which aligns matrices describing conserved regions using a Smith-Waterman approach
[29].
The methodology based on these two new algorithms is
capable of detecting motifs with weak overrepresentation
in a set of coregulated genes. By applying our procedure
on gene lists derived from real genome wide expression
studies, we show its ability to function effectively in noisy
data. In this context, the use of orthology information
compensates for a lower degree of motif overrepresentation We also compared its performance on a test data set,
with that of two other motif detection tools: one that is
exclusively based on coexpression information, AlignACE
[7], and another that is most similar to our method, PhyloCon [27]. With this comparison, we demonstrated the
robustness of our method over the two mentioned. Using
our method on two real biological data sets proved its biological applicability.

Results
General strategy
Several motif detection algorithms have been developed
to discover overrepresented motifs in sets of coexpressed
genes. However, in a noisy data set the motif might not be
sufficiently overrepresented to allow detection by classical
tools. To be able to recover motifs in such context, we
developed a procedure in which we first use phylogenetic
footprinting to delineate all potential motifs in each gene.
Then, we mutually compare all detected motifs and identify the ones that are shared by at least a few genes in the
data set as potential candidates.

The complete analysis flow is represented in figure 1 and
consists of the following steps: starting from a list of differentially expressed or coexpressed genes, we find the
orthologs for each gene in a number of closely related species. The obtained data sets, consisting of the intergenic
sequences of orthologous genes, are subjected to phylogenetic footprinting using a Gibbs Sampling tool called
BlockSampler (Step 1). This yields a list of conserved
regions (blocks) for each of the orthologous data sets, corresponding to all potential motifs. Searching for the

Flowchart of our algorithm. Input data: Based on microarray data, coexpressed genes are identified. For each of these
coexpressed genes, the orthologous intergenic sequences are identified. Step 1: BlockSampler: within a set of orthologous
intergenic sequences, conserved blocks are detected and stored as a Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM). Step 2: BlockAligner: The resulting PSSM's corresponding to conserved blocks, are aligned to each other with BlockAligner, which is a local
alignment tool that assigns a p-value to each alignment as a quality measure. Step 3: based on all these pairwise comparisons
and their corresponding p-values, a clustering is performed to group intergenic regions with a similar regulatory motif. Based
on the BlockAligner results, a regulatory motif model is constructed for each cluster. Step 4: the detected motif models are
used to screen all intergenic regions that were the input for the methodology.

motifs shared by at least some of the original list of coexpressed genes, we mutually align our blocks with BlockAligner (step 2), and then we construct a multiple
alignment using the pairwise alignment scores to delineate further the potential regulatory motifs (step 3). As our
methodology only detects motifs in genes for which
orthologous information is available, some motif hits in
the initial gene list might escape detection. To recover
these motifs, we use the motif models we obtained from
the previous step to screen the intergenic sequences of the
remaining genes (step 4).
Here we give an overview of the main tools we used in our
flow. Algorithmic details can be found in the methods section.
BlockSampler is used to detect conserved motifs in intergenic sequences of orthologous genes. The algorithm is an
adapted version of MotifSampler, a motif detection algorithm based on Gibbs sampling [2]. Due to the specificities of the scoring scheme (see methods) the algorithm
does not require the motif to be present in each single
orthologous sequence. Although regions conserved in the
entire set of sequences will receive a better score, the
regions conserved in less than the entire set could still be
retained. In contrast to the original implementation [30],
BlockSampler allows for scoring each orthologous intergenic sequence in the input data set with its corresponding species specific background model. Since it is often the
case with closely related species that big stretches around
the motifs are conserved [23,31], BlockSampler was
adapted to look for long conserved sequence blocks.
BlockSampler also allows for the choice of a reference species, usually corresponding to the species of interest for
which the experimental data are available. The consequence of using a reference species is that only the conserved regions that include the reference species will be
retained.
BlockAligner performs a local ungapped pairwise alignment, based on dynamic programming for the mutual
comparison of sequence blocks, represented as frequency
matrices. The scoring scheme of BlockAligner is based on
the Kullback-Leiber distance. We used a graph clustering
algorithm to group the blocks shared by multiple genes
[32]. This algorithm is optimized to cluster sequences
based on pairwise alignment scores.
Evaluation of the analysis flow on test data
We applied our analysis flow on test data sets with known
motif instances. As shown in figure 2, the data sets are
made up of sequences with instances for the motifs PhoP,
LexA, Fur and MetJ, imbedded in a varying number of random sequences. Five collections of data sets were created
with an increasing number of random sequences, decreas-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/160

ing the signal to noise ratio from 18- 7% for Fur and LexA
and 11- 4% for MetJ and PhoP (dyad motif). For the purpose of evaluating the performance of the methodology,
we adopted four measurements: recovery rate, number of
false positives, specificity and sensitivity. The former two
are a reflection of how well a true motif model is
extracted, while the latter two are measurements of the
extracted motif's quality. Specifically, the recovery rate
measures the number of times a motif model corresponding to a true motif is recovered by the algorithm; the
number of false positives measures the average number of
motif models not corresponding to the true motifs recovered by the algorithm; the sensitivity measures the ratio of
true motif instances that contributed to the recovered
motif model; the specificity measures the ratio of false
motif instances that contributed to the recovered motif
model (for details see methods). Note that these values
were calculated before the last screening step of the algorithm, so that all instances recovered by screening are not
included in the calculations.
As shown in figure 3 and the supplementary table 1[33],
our methodology performed well in retrieving the MetJ,
LexA and PhoP motif models, with relatively low effect of
the increasing noise in the data set. Only for the Fur motif
the recovery rate was low, but with high resistance to
noise. Analysis of the results showed that during the run
of the methodology, the Fur motif instances were clustered in a single cluster (step 3), however, together with
degenerated blocks lacking Fur instances. The presence of
such blocks in the subsequent motif delineation step
causes the consensus score of the Fur motif model to drop
below the selected threshold, explaining why it was not
frequently recovered using our stringent criteria.
The number of false positives picked up by the algorithm
was low (table 1), ranging between an average of 0.5 in
the low noise data sets to 0.8 in the high noise sets. This
shows the robustness of the algorithm against noise in the
data.
Regarding the quality of the motif models recovered, figure 3 shows that the algorithm achieved relatively high
sensitivity and specificity for Fur, MetJ and LexA, indicating that most true instances contributed to the model, and
that few false ones did. In the case of PhoP, the sensitivity
was low due to the fact that the model recovered by our
algorithm was the dyad variant, while the two instances of
the half site variant (bioA and pmrD) did not contribute to
the model.
Importance of the selected species
To assess the importance of adding a distantly related species to the analysis (in our case Y. pestis), we tested to what
extent motif instances in this species contributed to the

motif models returned by our algorithm. Instances of Y.
pestis seemed to have contributed to the resulting motif
models in more than 90% of the cases for MetJ and LexA,
more than 80% for PhoP, and more than 75% for the Fur
motif. On the other hand, adding Y. pestis did not decrease
the sensitivity of our motif models: motif instances that
were only conserved in S. typhimurium and E. coli, but not
in Y. pestis were also recovered. These results indicate that
aligned blocks are not dominated by the sequences of the
most related species and that adding a distantly related
species helps delineating the true motifs without decreasing the sensitivity, even when motif instances are no
longer conserved across all species.
Comparison with other methodologies
We compared the performance of our methodology to
that of two other motif detection algorithms: AlignACE, a
Gibbs sampling algorithm designed to detect overrepresented motifs in a set of coregulated genes and PhyloCon,
an algorithm that uses information on coexpression and
orthology for motif detection.

AlignACE was applied to our test data sets without taking
orthology information into account. Execution parameters are described in Methods. As displayed in Figure 3,
only two out of the four motifs could be detected by AlignACE with very low recovery rates. In addition, the performance for those two motifs drops significantly when
increasing the number of random genes (Figure 3 panel
A). While the number of false positives seems to be independent of the noise, it is clearly high (varying between
16.9 and 18.3 compared to 0.5â0.8 for our algorithm
(Table 1)). Regarding the quality of the motifs recovered,
Fur and LexA, the sensitivity was always high, however, at
the expense of a lower specificity. No values for sensitivity
and specificity were calculated for PhoP and MetJ as these
motifs were not detected. Our methodology clearly outperformed AlignACE in three aspects: the number of true
motifs recovered, the quality of the motifs and the robustness against noise. This result is expected as AlignACE uses
one source of information i.e. genes from one species,
while our methodology depends on two sources i.e. single
species genes and their orthologs.

Plot of the recovery rate, sensitivity and specificity
Plot of the recovery rate, sensitivity and specificity. For each of the four motifs (Fur, MetJ, LexA and PhoP), the recovery rate (A), the sensitivity (B) and specificity (C) is plotted for each of the three algorithms (BlockSampler: â , AlignACE: â²,
PhyloCon: á­). At the X-axis of each plot, the number of added random genes is indicated. No sensitivity or specificity data for
a specific algorithm means that this characteristic could not be calculated due to a recovery rate of 0.

In the case of PhyloCon, it also failed to recover MetJ and
PhoP (figure 3). Although it was previously reported that
it is possible to detect the MetJ motif in a dataset containing only MetJ intergenic regions [27] (confirmed in our
lab), PhyloCon clearly failed to do so in the noisy context
of our study. For LexA, PhyloCon recovered the motif at a
rate comparable to that of our algorithm, and only marginally affected by the increasing noise in the data. PhyloCon performed well in retrieving the Fur motif, but with a
recovery rate slightly sensitive to noise. Calculating the
false positive discovery rate for PhyloCon illustrates that
this algorithm is not sensitive to low signal to noise ratios

(false positives ranging between 5.1 and 5.7) (Table 1).
However, the absolute number of false positives is higher
than that in the case of our methodology.
Regarding the quality of the motif models, the Fur motif
model retrieved by PhyloCon seemingly outperforms our
retrieved model both in sensitivity and specificity with
hardly any effect for the noise in the data set. For the LexA
motif, an optimal specificity was obtained but with mediocre sensitivity, indicating that the motif model, although
frequently recovered, is often based on just two or three
LexA instances.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/160

It is important to emphasize that all the values obtained
for the performance assessment of PhyloCon are biased to
its favor in this case. One needs to note that in all the occasions when PhyloCon did not converge to a known motif,
we retrieved the motif model from a cycle premature of
convergence (for details see Methods: Benchmarking with
other methodologies). Thus, slightly better sensitivities
and recovery rates of PhyloCon over our methodology
need to be interpreted in the light of this fact.
Again, our methodology proved to be more robust to
noise than similarly based algorithms as seen in its ability
to recover all the true motif models in the data set with
very few false positives.
Evaluation of the analysis flow on expression data
Besides the test data sets, we applied our methodology on
two data sets derived from genome wide expression studies. A first data set consisted of a list of 47 differentially
expressed genes between a constitutive and a null pmrA
mutant of S. typhimurium [34]. The PmrAB two-component regulatory system is part of a multi-component feedback loop that acts as a major virulence regulator in S.
typhimurium. The system itself is responsive to Fe3+ and
mild acid and senses Mg2+ indirectly by communicating
with the Mg2+ sensitive PhoPQ system via PmrD. Applying
our analysis flow on the intergenic sequences of these
coexpressed genes (BlockSampler, followed by BlockAligner and clustering) resulted in the detection of two
potential motifs. The first motif which was derived from
the motif instances of the known PmrA regulated genes
udg, yfbE, yibD and yjdB, corresponded to the consensus of
the biologically validated PmrA motif (consensus CTTAAN5-CTTAA) [23,35,36]. The motif logo is shown in figure
4.A (details about motif instances: Additional file 2 or
[33]) Screening the intergenic regions of the remaining
differentially expressed genes from the input set with this
motif model, resulted in the detection of six additional
potential PmrA targets. Two of these six genes (S. typhimurium (STM1269 and ais) did not contain an ortholog in E.
coli or Y. pestis, and in the four remaining genes (ybjG,
ygiW, yijP and yegH) the PmrA motif was not conserved in
the orthologs of E. coli or Y. pestis, explaining the reason

these motif instances could not be recovered initially
unless by screening.
The (direct or indirect) regulation of eight of these
reported ten genes by PmrAB is supported by evidence
from previous studies. Seven of these genes â ais (pmrG),
yjdB (pmrC), yfbE (pmrH), ugd (udg, pmrE, pagA), yibD,
ybjG (mig-13) and STM1269 (aroQ) â are known members
of the PmrAB regulon that were confirmed in different
experiments [23,34-38]. The last gene, yijP (STM4118),
was also discovered in an in silico screening of this same
microarray data by Tamayo et al. [34].
We also report two new potential PmrA targets, ygiW and
yegH, that were not recovered by Tamayo et al [34]. This
could be due to the more stringent threshold they used
when defining differentially expressed genes, than ours
(see above).
In addition to the well known PmrA motif, we predicted
yet an uncharacterized motif (consensus (T/A)AAGGAAnA) (figure 4B) which was based on conserved
instances present in tufA, yihT and STM2186 (Additional
file 2 or [33]). Screening the remaining differentially
expressed genes with the motif model corresponding to
this motif resulted in the discovery of motif instances in
two additional genes (sopD and STM1472). No similarity
between this motif and any of the motifs in the existing
databases could be found (RegulonDB [39]).
The second data set was derived from the study of Salmon
et al. [40]. E. coli and related species respond to oxygen
depletion by switching to anaerobic respiration. This transition is mainly controlled by the global regulator FNR
[41]. Salmon et al. [40] performed genome wide expression profiling experiments to identify genes differentially
expressed in response to oxygen and controlled by FNR.
Applying our methodology to 83 differentially expressed
genes derived from their study resulted in the detection of
a motif model corresponding to the well known FNR
motif (motif logo: figure 4.C, details of motif instances:
Additional file 2 and [33]). The model was based on conserved instances found in 4 known FNR regulated genes
narX, nirB, ndh and cydA (RegulonDB). The instances

shared regulatory motif are clustered. In a final step,
screening of all input intergenic regions permits for the
detection of those target genes where the motif was not
conserved in its orthologs (if existing).

FNR regulated in RegulonDB (cyoA, dcuC and frdA) did
not contribute to our FNR motif model. It seems like the
degree of conservation of the motif among the respective
orthologs of these genes was too low to be detected by our
analysis flow. However, these genes could be retrieved in
the screening step.

Discussion
If we want to be able to get a complete view on the transcriptional network of an organism, revealing all regulatory motifs remains one of the main challenges [15].
Despite the fact that several motif detection algorithms
have been developed and optimized, detection of regulatory motifs with low overrepresentation is still difficult
using the common motif detection tools. Therefore we
developed a tool that is able to retrieve regulatory motifs
planted in a noisy environment i.e. only a very small subset of submitted intergenic regions contains the motif. In
a first step of our method, large conserved regulatory
regions (i.e. blocks) are identified in a set of orthologous
intergenic regions (BlockSampler). After aligning all these

To test its reliability, we applied our methodology on a
"golden standard" consisting of a set of randomly
selected, non-related genes among which known targets
of the Fur, MetJ, LexA and PhoP regulons were hidden.
Although these known targets contained previously
described motif instances for each of these regulators,
their statistical overrepresentation in this test set was low
(18% going down to 7% for Fur and LexA, 11% down to
4% for MetJ and PhoP (dyad motif)). When applying our
methodology we found that for 3 out of the 4 hidden
motifs the recovery rate was above 90% even in the presence of a high amount of noisy genes. For the Fur motif it
was slightly lower (50% on average) because of the lower
degree of conservation of the motif model (consensus
score of 1.02 for the Fur motif versus 1.21, 1.27 and 1.26
for the MetJ, PhoP and LexA motif respectively). Notwithstanding this high recovery rate, the number of false positive motifs (i.e. motifs not corresponding to any of the
motifs hidden in the data set) remained low (an average
of 0.50 false positives per run when 10 random genes are
added versus 0.80 when 50 random genes are added). The
achieved quality of the retrieved motif models, reflected
by the motif model sensitivity (the number of true
instances contributing to the motif model) and specificity
(the number of false positive instances degrading the
motif model) depends on the characteristics of the motifs;
well conserved, non-dyad motifs such as the LexA and
MetJ motifs are seemingly easy to retrieve and have a high
quality; dyad motifs (PhoP and Fur), although having
high specificity (above 80%), their sensitivity was lower
than in the case of non-dyad motifs, especially for the
PhoP dyad. In the case of the PhoP motif, the low sensitivity is due to the fact that it also occurs as a single half
site. The score of the alignment of the single half site with
the dyad falls below the thresholds we used and therefore
these single sites could not be recovered by our methodology.
To assess the influence of taking into account orthology
information in addition to information from coexpression, we applied our methodology to a combined data set
of orthologous and coexpressed genes and compared its
results to those obtained by applying AlignACE, which is
a motif detection tool based on Gibbs sampling, to the
coexpression data only. Our methodology clearly outperformed AlignACE in recovering the true motifs in the data
set. In addition, the performance of AlignACE was seriously influenced by increasing noise in the data, in contrast to what is observed with our methodology. These

results indicate that by the incorporation of orthology
information, the retrieval of motifs with weak overrepresentation (ranging between 11% and 4%) becomes possible.
In addition to the above mentioned advantage of using
the combined sources of information of coexpression and
orthology, an extra value can be deduced. When using
phylogenetic footprinting alone on orthologous gene sets
of closely related species sharing a large part of the regulatory mechanism, long conserved blocks are detected
rather than small distinct motifs [23]. Because this complicates the delineation of specific motifs, the sequential
use of BlockSampler (utilizing orthology information)
and BlockAligner (utilizing coexpression information)
allows for an improved delineation of individual regulatory motifs from those long conserved regions across
orthologs.

ment results to the favor of PhyloCon, as seen in the
higher recovery rate, sensitivity and specificity acquired
for PhyloCon over our method.
As a final proof of concept, we also applied our methodology to two gene sets derived from genome wide expression profiling experiments. Firstly, out of 47 differentially
expressed genes between constitutive and null pmrA
mutants of S. typhimurium [34], we could retrieve the
expected PmrA motif model [23,35,36], and predict the
presence of two new putative PmrA targets, ygiW and
yegH. We also predicted a yet uncharacterized motif of the
consensus (T/A)AAGGAAnA that was based on conserved
instances in the genes tufA, yihT and STM2186. In a second test, using a list of 83 FNR regulated genes [40], we
could retrieve the FNR motif model based on 4 genes containing a clear FNR regulatory motif.

Conclusion
We also compared our methodology to PhyloCon, as it
has a similar strategy as ours. PhyloCon identifies conserved regulatory regions (profiles, called blocks in our
study) in sets of orthologs based on the Wconsensus program. Subsequently, these profiles are merged between
different sets of orthologs using a greedy algorithm, in
order to detect a common regulatory motif.
PhyloCon was originally developed to detect motifs in a
set of coexpressed genes, containing only one motif. The
test sets used in the original paper usually contain a single
motif per data set. As was noted by the authors, PhyloCon
would perform better on less conserved motifs. Indeed,
our results show that PhyloCon had a better performance
in retrieving the more degenerated Fur motif than the well
conserved LexA, MetJ and PhoP motifs. Despite this, the
overall recovery rate was lower than that of our methodology in noisy data sets containing more than one motif.
The MetJ and PhoP motifs were not recovered at all.
Although the authors stated that their methodology can
retrieve regulatory regions present in only a small set of
genes (e.g. MetJ), in our experience PhyloCon fails to
retrieve such motifs in a noisy context. In addition, as PhyloCon proceeds cycle per cycle, where in each cycle a new
motif instance is added to the motif model, the authors
suggest that the motif model building process be stopped
before convergence in order to detect more motifs in a single dataset. However, they do not provide a clear stop criteria or heuristics to retrieve the optimal model. In order
not to bias our results towards a sub-optimal stop criterion, we checked at each cycle whether a motif model was
found that matched our test data set. If found during at
least one cycle, the motif was considered "recovered".
Note that this approach is feasible when one knows which
motif to look for, but not in the case when a novel motif
is searched for. This approach led to the bias of the assess-

Conclusively, we have developed an approach that can
reliably identify multiple regulatory motifs lacking a high
degree of overrepresentation in a set of coexpressed genes
(motifs belonging to sparsely connected hubs in the regulatory network) by exploiting the advantages of using
both coexpression and phylogenetic information.
Through comparing our methodology to two other motif
detection programs, we show the robustness of our implementation. As a proof of concept, analysis of genome
wide expression data with our methodology successfully
retrieves the present regulatory motifs.

Methods

The selection of intergenic regions and the construction of
species specific background models, relied on modules
implemented in INCLUSive [30]. Intergenic regions are
defined as the non-coding parts between two coding
sequences. The regions used in this study were derived
from the following genomes: Escherichia coli K12 [GenBank: NC_000913], Escherichia coli plasmid R721 [GenBank: NC_002525], Escherichia coli O157:H7 EDL933

Close homologs (either orthologs or paralogs) were identified as described in Marchal et al. [23].
For benchmarking, different test data were compiled consisting of a core set of genes with known motifs (PhoP,
LexA, Fur and MetJ) supplemented with sets of random
genes varying in number and composition. A core set of
genes with known binding sites was selected based on the
RegulonDB database [39] for respectively LexA, Fur, and
MetJ. Genes containing known PhoP motifs were selected
from Monsieurs et al. [42]. The composition of the core
gene set is heterogeneous in terms of the number of
instances and conservation of each motif. An overview of
this composition is given in figure 2. For MetJ (3 genes)
and LexA (5 genes), the motif instances where conserved
in all the species used in this study. For 3 out of the 5 Fur
regulated genes and 1 out of the PhoP regulated genes, a
motif instance was not present in Y. pestis. Starting from
this core set, different test data were generated by gradually adding an increasing number of random genes. To
this end, genes having an intergenic sequence larger than
100 nucleotides and a sufficient number of orthologs in
the organisms of interest were selected randomly from the
Salmonella genome. By sampling ten times respectively 10,
20, 30, 40 and 50 random genes and adding these to the
core gene set, a total of 50 test sets was created.
For the construction of the PmrA data set, the data corresponding to an experiment described by Tamayo et al.
[34] were downloaded from the Stanford Microarray
Database [43]. In their analysis, Tamayo et al compared
the mRNA expression between PmrA-constitutive and
PmrA-null strains at two different time points (early- and
mid-logarithmic phase of growth). As input data set, we
selected two times 40 genes out of this microarray results
that were most up- or down-regulated respectively in both
conditions. Notice that we used a less stringent threshold
than Tamayo et al. [34] who only selected 41 genes that
exhibited a minimal fold change of 2 at both time points.
After elimination of those genes with in an intergenic
region smaller than 50 nucleotides, only 47 out of these
80 genes were retained. For the application of our methodology on data sets derived from genome wide expression studies, we relied on the data previously published in
Salmon et al. [40] to build the FNR data set. All 125 genes
assigned by Salmon et al. to a cluster affected by a mutation of fnr (i.e. 6 out of the 8 different clusters), were combined and used as input data for our methodology. From
these 125 genes, 83 genes with an intergenic region longer
than 50 nucleotides were retained.

Analysis flow
Step 1: Detecting conserved blocks with BlockSampler
BlockSampler is based on the original Gibbs sampling
algorithm of MotifSampler. Briefly, the Gibbs sampling
procedure starts by searching for a motif shared by at least
2 sequences and having one occurrence in the reference
sequence (the sequence of interest, see below). After convergence, short motif seeds are identified. The identification of these seeds is predicated on the log likelihood
score [2]. This score depends on the degree of conservation of the motif and the number of instances detected in
the species. Thus, the more species in which the motif is
conserved and the higher its degree of conservation, the
higher is its corresponding score. High scoring seeds are
subsequently extended using a simple protocol: if the consensus score over a 5-nt region adjacent (upstream or
downstream) to the current motif seed exceeds a given
threshold the motif is extended with one nucleotide (in
that direction). Detected conserved intergenic regions (i.e.
blocks) of variable length are eventually reported. To
select the most promising hits from the output of BlockSampler, we designed a score that is independent of block
sequence length, but increases with the degree of conservation of the motifs. This normalized consensus score is
appropriate because short motifs have a higher chance of
resulting in a high consensus score. Normalization was
done by recalculating the consensus scoring according to
the following formula: Csad = (L/L+E) Cs, where Csad is the
normalized consensus score, L is the length of the conserved block, E is an empirical factor (set to 6) and Cs the
consensus score. Different empirical factors were tested on
different data sets, and 6 appeared to give the best balance
between block sequence length and conservation.
Depending on the interest of a particular study, the empirical factor can be enlarged to favor larger blocks. Blocks
are then ranked according to this normalized consensus
score

BlockSampler requires six user-defined parameters: 1) the
definition of a reference sequence: the reference sequence
is the sequence in which the presence of the conserved
block is required (in our case, it was set to be Salmonella
typhimurium); 2) the number of runs: as BlockSampler is
based on Gibbs sampling the algorithm should be repeatedly applied on the same input set (set at 100 runs); 3)
strand: only the plus strand is searched; 4) prior: set at
default value of 0.2; 5) threshold of the consensus score:
only blocks exceeding a consensus score of 1.3 are
retained; 6) minimal motif length: minimal width of the
block is set to 8.
As is the case with other Gibbs sampling based motif
detection procedures, the same block can be detected several times over the different runs of the algorithm. To
compile a list of non redundant blocks, blocks overlap-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/160

ping for more than 75% were grouped. From each set of
overlapping blocks, the one displaying the highest (normalized) consensus score was chosen as representative
and retained for further analysis. Each block is represented
by a motif model, in the form of a frequency matrix.
Step 2: Aligning conserved blocks using BlockAligner
The algorithm uses a local ungapped alignment strategy
based on dynamic programming to mutually compare
conserved blocks represented by their respective motif
models (frequency matrices M1 and M2). The following
additive scoring scheme is used: the total alignment score
of two motif models is the sum of the individual column
scores. A column score (S) is defined as the distance
between two aligned columns of the frequency matrices.
As a measure, the Kullback-Leiber distance between two
probability distributions is used, since the columns of a
motif model can be considered to be the parameters of
multinomial distributions. To make the scoring scheme
compatible with dynamic programming, matching columns should score positively and non-matching columns
negatively. Therefore the minimal match value of the
Kullback-Leiber distance T was introduced. T is a user
defined parameter that determines the stringency of the
alignment. Columns with a score below T receive a negative score, while columns with a score above T receive a
positive score. As a result, the following score of the alignment of two columns, i and j of two conserved blocks
(represented by the frequency matrices M1 and M2) can
be calculated:

S(i, j) = T â

T

M1

â M1b,i * log M2b,i

b= A

b, j

+ M2b , j * log

M2b , j
M1b ,i

S(i,j) will be equal to T if column i and j of motif models
M1 and M2 respectively, are exactly the same.
As a biological motif is often "gapped" i.e. consisting of
conserved nucleotides intersected by some non-conserved
nucleotides, we introduced a small non-match penalty.
Remark that this is different from a "gap score" in alignment algorithms [29,44], as insertions and deletions are
not explicitly modelled (we use a local ungapped alignment).
This leads to the following scheme for the alignment
matrix:
A(i,j) = max(0,A(i-1,j-1) + S(i,j),A(i-1,j-1) â NonMatchScore) for i>1 && j>1
A(i,1) = max(S(i,1),0)
A(1,j) = max(S(i,1),0)

In our setup, BlockAligner was used with the following
parameter set: T value = 0.40; minimal length of the
reported common motif = 6 nucleotides.
To assess the significance of the results, the alignment procedure was repeated 100 times on the same motif models
(M1 and M2) after randomly shuffling their columns. The
distribution of the scores obtained by aligning these randomly shuffled motif models was used to estimate the
parameters of an extreme value distribution. This background distribution allowed obtaining a p-value for the
genuine alignment (i.e. assessing the probability of
obtaining by coincidence the score observed when aligning the unshuffled blocks). Blocks with a p-value below
0.001 were considered significant.
Step 3: Clustering conserved blocks and delineating regulatory motifs
Conserved blocks shared by different orthologous gene
sets were grouped using a graph based clustering algorithm TribeMCL [32]. Nodes of the graph represent conserved blocks and edges represent the quality of the
alignment between these conserved blocks. We used the log10 of the p-value of the pairwise alignments (see previous step) as weight measure for the edges. To prevent
inflating spurious relations between blocks based on low
scoring alignment scores, only alignments with a p-value
lower than 0.001 were taken into account.

Based on the pairwise alignment scores between the conserved blocks grouped within the same cluster, a multiple
alignment is created, which is subsequently converted
into a frequency matrix. Such matrix representing the
multiple alignment of conserved blocks in a cluster can be
seen as a model of the average motif that is conserved in
the intergenic region of several sets of orthologous genes
and to which all orthologous genes from the original
orthologous sets of the cluster contribute. This multiple
alignment was converted in a frequency matrix. From this
frequency matrix, the minimal regulatory motif was
defined as the 1) the region conserved in at least three reference genes, 2) with a minimal length of 6 nucleotides
and 3) with a consensus score higher than or equal to
1.10. This minimal motif is extended with additional
motif positions in both directions until the consensus
score drops below the threshold of 1.10.
To construct a motif model specific for the reference species, the multiple alignment is based only on the motif
instances contributing to the blocks that originate from
the reference species.
Step 4: Genome wide screening for additional targets
Screening of promoter regions with the obtained motif
models is performed using MotifLocator [23,45]. The cutoff value for a screening was derived based on the lowest

MotifLocator score of known target genes of the corresponding regulatory protein.
Benchmarking with other methodologies
Running AlignACE
AlignACE can be obtained at the AlignACE website [46].
AlignACE is a Gibbs Sampling algorithm for detecting regulatory motifs that are overrepresented in the promoter
regions of a set of potentially coregulated genes. Therefore, the test sets used for AlignACE only contained information from coexpressed genes i.e. the intergenic regions
of the reference genes from S. typhimurium sharing a similar motif. Orthologous information was not explicitly
used. We run AlignACE with default parameter setting
except that we give the GC content of species from which
the intergenic regions are used as input (0.52 for S. typhimurium). AlignACE returns series of motif models that are
overrepresented in the input promoter regions.
Running PhyloCon
PhyloCon uses the same information sources as our methodology [27]. This algorithm also starts from a set of genes
that are potentially co-regulated (e.g. derived from microarray data) and uses orthologous information to detect
novel regulatory motifs. This two-step procedure starts
with aligning orthologous intergenic sequences and creating position specific scoring matrices (called profiles)
based on the Wconsensus program [5]. Then PhyloCon
compares these profiles generated from different genes
and identifies the common regions in these profiles using
a greedy approach. Because PhyloCon is optimised to use
the same sources of information (both coexpression and
orthology) as our methodology, the same test data sets
could be used. When running PhyloCon (downloaded
from [47]), the number of standard deviations was set
between 0.5 and 2, but this only marginally affected the
results. The way PhyloCon works is that the motif model
grows cycle per cycle. In each cycle a new motif instance is
added to the motif model. In the original article no clear
stop criteria or heuristics were provided, so it is difficult to
decide at which cycle an optimal motif model is detected.
By screening all different cycles of the PhyloCon runs, we
looked for runs of which at least one cycle shows a match
to one of the known motif models. In a single run, more
than one cycle can contain a motif of interest. For each
particular motif the cycle that shows the highest combined sensitivity specificity score for the corresponding
motif model was used for the calculation of the sensitivity,
specificity and false positives.
Test Run
Each test run consisted of applying one of the specified
algorithms to 10 test sets of similar composition (i.e. same
number of random genes is added). The recovery rate of
detecting a particular motif was defined as the percentage

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/160

of test sets in which this motif could be recovered. For
instance, if the LexA motif model was found in 6 of the 10
test sets each of which contained LexA regulated genes, the
performance was defined to be 60%.
The exact content of a test run depends on the specificities
of the algorithm applied. One test run of the methodology
presented in this study was defined as applying the complete procedure on the test set (100 runs of BlockSampler,
BlockAligner, Clustering, motif delineation). A single test
run of PhyloCon or AlignACE was defined as running
once the algorithm on the test set (see running PhyloCon
and Running AlignACE).
Performance evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the different motif detection algorithms, we reported 1) the average recovery rate
and 2) the average number of false positives. The average
recovery rate reports how many times a motif model corresponding to a motif, known to be present in the test sets,
was found on average in the test runs on different test sets
of the same composition. 2) the average number of false
positives reports how many times a motif model not corresponding to any motif known to be present in the test
sets, was found on average in the test runs on different
data sets of the same composition. Motifs known to be
present in the data sets were represented by a benchmark
of curated motif models extracted from the RegulonDB
database [39]. A detected motif model was considered
identical to a benchmark motif model when the KullbackLeiber distance (as implemented in MotifComparison)
between the two motif models was lower than 0.65
(default parameter); otherwise it was considered as a false
positive. The calculation of the number of false positives
for AlignACE and PhyloCon was done as follows: all
motif models that were returned from the AlignACE algorithm, were aligned with the benchmark motif models. If
such a motif model did not show similarity to any of the
four motifs known to be present in the test sets, this motif
model was regarded a false positive. For PhyloCon, no
clear stop criterion is described. For that reason, we only
took into account those cycles for which a hit with a
benchmark motif model was detected. All motifs in these
cycles that did not show a match with a benchmark motif
model were treated as a false positive.
Motif quality
To represent the quality of the obtained motif models, we
calculated motif model sensitivity and specificity using
the following definitions:

SENS =

TP
Ã100%
TP + FN

BMC Bioinformatics 2006, 7:160

where TP is the number of true positives motif instances
(i.e. motif instances known to be present in the data set
that contributed to the detected motif model) and FN is
the number of false negatives (i.e. motif instances known
to be present in the data set that did not contribute to the
detected motif model).
