Abstract
The Balkan region and Kosovo in particular, is a well-known Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
(CCHF) endemic region, with frequent epidemic outbreaks and sporadic cases occurring with a
hospitalized case fatality of approximately 30%. Recent analysis of complete genome sequences of
diverse CCHF virus strains showed that the genome plasticity of the virus is surprisingly high for
an arthropod-borne virus. High levels of nucleotide and amino acid differences, frequent RNA
segment reassortment and even RNA recombination have been recently described. This diversity
illustrates the need to determine the complete genome sequence of CCHF virus representatives
of all geographically distinct endemic areas, particularly in light of the high pathogenicity of the virus
and its listing as a potential bioterrorism threat. Here we describe the first complete CCHF virus
genome sequence of a virus (strain Kosova Hoti) isolated from a hemorrhagic fever case in the
Balkans. This virus strain was isolated from a fatal CCHF case, and passaged only twice on Vero E6
cells prior to sequence analysis. The virus total genome was found to be 19.2 kb in length, consisting
of a 1672 nucleotide (nt) S segment, a 5364 nt M segment and a 12150 nt L segment. Phylogenetic
analysis of CCHF virus complete genomes placed the Kosova Hoti strain in the Europe/Turkey
group, with highest similarity seen with Russian isolates. The virus M segments are the most diverse
with up to 31 and 27% differences seen at the nt and amino acid levels, and even 1.9% amino acid
difference found between the Kosova Hoti and another strain from Kosovo (9553-01). This
suggests that distinct virus strains can coexist in highly endemic areas.

Findings
Bioinformatics analysis of complete microbial genomes
has led to advances in the development of novel diagnostic techniques, in the research of microbial pathogenesis,

and in the control and prevention of infectious diseases.
Until the year 2006, only 2 complete genomes of
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) had
been sequenced [1]. CCHFV, is a tick-borne virus with tri-

partite RNA genome (S, M and L segment), and is the
causative agent of a lethal zoonosis named CrimeanCongo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF). The virus is distributed
over much of Asia, extending from China to the Middle
East and Southern Russia and to the focal endemic areas
in Africa and southern Europe, including Kosovo and Turkey [2]. Yearly epidemics, as well as sporadic cases of
CCHF are seen in some of these areas, often with high case
fatality (approx. 30%) [3]. CCHFV can be transmitted to
humans by bites of Ixodid ticks and by the contact with
blood or tissue from viremic livestock and human
patients [2]. Development of diagnostic approaches and
potential vaccines is dependent on knowledge of the
broad geographic distribution of diverse virus variants
and on understanding of the extent of virus genetic reassortment and recombination [3,4]. The analysis of the 16
existing complete CCHFV genomes up to date indicated
considerable evolution and high diversity of CCHFV
[1,5]. Presumably this reflects the typical high polymerase
error rates seen with negative stranded RNA viruses. In
addition, previous reports have found evidence of RNA
segment reassortment events between CCHFV M segments, and the recombination in CCHFV S segments
[1,3,4]. The genetic diversity of CCHFV, its virulence, and
its potential as a bioterrorism agent, make it important to
obtain the complete genome of CCHFV from all geographically distinct endemic areas.

are deposited in the GenBank under the accession numbers DQ133507, EU037902 and EU044832, respectively.
Sequence alignment of CCHFV Kosova Hoti strain complete genome with preexisting CCHFV genomes was performed using the CLUSTAL W algorithm of MegAlign
module (Lasergene 1999, DNASTAR, USA). Phylogenetic
relationships of different CCHFV strains were established
with a software package TREECON [14]. The phylogenetic
tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method. The
topology of the tree was obtained with the Kimura 80
model and support for the tree nodes was calculated with
500 bootstrap replicates. SignalIP was used to predict the
signal sequence cleavage site and TMHMM 2.0 was used
to predict transmembrane helices of M segment [15,16].
The amino acid (aa) sequence of L segment was subjected
to the PSI-BLAST and PredictProtein server for search of
conserved aa motifs [17,18].

The Balkan peninsula, and Kosovo in particular, is a wellknown endemic region for CCHF, and epidemic outbreaks and sporadic cases have been frequently been
recorded [6-8]. Five nucleotide sequences of CCHFV from
Kosovo have been published [9-12]. Three of them are
partial sequences of S segment, the remaining 2 represent
complete sequences of S and M segment of different
CCHFV strains, Kosova Hoti and Kosovo 9553-01, respectively. We describe the first complete CCHFV genome
sequence of a virus (strain Kosova Hoti) isolated from a
hemorrhagic fever case in the Balkans.

Three phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the
ORF sequences of S, M and L segments of CCHFV (Fig. 1).
The general topologies of the trees were consistent with
those described previously [1,13]. Seven distinct groups
were formed representing the approximate geographic
distribution of CCHFV. Based on the analysis of S, M and
L segment of Kosova Hoti CCHFV, this strain clustered in
group V., which represents the Europe/Turkey geographic
lineage [1]. The position of Kosova Hoti strain within
group V. was similar in the S and L segment tree (Fig. 1,
panels A and C), where it formed a separate lineage ancestral to the three Russian isolates and CCHFV strain
200310849 from Turkey was the most ancestral member
of V. group. The group V. topology based on the M segment, was a little different (Fig. 1, panel B). Two Russian
strains (VLV-100 and Kashmanov) clustered together with
the Turkish CCHFV whereas the Russian Drosdov strain
clustered together with both CCHFV strains from Kosovo.

The CCHFV Kosova Hoti strain was isolated from a blood
of a female fatal case during the epidemic in Kosovo in
2001 [6]. The blood was taken on the 5th day after onset
of symptoms. Results of the laboratory analysis showed
the presence of IgM antibodies (titer 1:400) and the presence of viral RNA in the concentration of 1.08 × 1010 copies per mL of serum. Virus was grown on Vero E6 cells in
BSL-3 laboratory. Viral RNA was extracted with the Trizol
reagent from the second passage of the CCHFV in Vero E6
cells, and used for the direct sequencing of the complete
genome of the virus. Amplicons of S, M and L full length
segments were obtained by following the protocols
described previously [1,9,13]. Briefly, a total of 16 S, 40 M
and 84 L sequencing primers were used to generate the
complete sequence of the S, M and L segments and these

The genome size of CCHFV, strain Kosova Hoti, was
found to be approximately 19.2 kb in length, consisting of
a 1672 nucleotide (nt) S segment, a 5364 nt M segment
and a 12150 nt L segment. The open reading frame (ORF)
of S segment is 1449 nt in length, encoding a 482 aa (nt
position 56 – 1504) nucleocapsid protein. The ORF
lengths of M and L segments are 5067 nt/1688 aa (nt position 78–5144) and 11838 nt/3945 aa (nt position 78–
11915), respectively.

The sequence differences between the CCHFV strains in
the group V. are shown in Tables 1, 2, 3. Significant difference was noted between the nt (ORF) and aa sequences of
S and L segments, in comparison to the M segment. The
majority of nt changes in the S and L segments were synonymous (not amino acid changing) (Tables 1, 3),
whereas over 80% of M segment nt changes were non-synonymous (amino acid changing) (Table 2). As seen in ear-

lier studies [12,19,20], considerable glycoprotein amino
acid variation was observed, particularly in the mucin-like
variable region (Fig. 2), and presumably reflects the biological function of the glycoproteins encoded by the M
segment. It is somewhat surprising that the glycoproteins
of Kosova Hoti and another strain from Kosovo, 9553-01,
differed by 1.9% in complete aa sequence, and up to 4.5%
in the mucin-like domain (Table 2). This suggests different genetic strains of CCHFV co-exist in this highly
endemic region.
The analysis of the Kosova Hoti strain M segment encoded
polyprotein predicted the cleavage of the signal peptide to
occur between aa 27 and 28 (AHG-QS). This site is identical to those described for Kosovo 9553-01 and Kashmanov but differs from other strains in group V. (Fig. 2).
The mucin-like variable region of Kosova Hoti strain polyprotein stretches from aa 28 to 251 and differs by up to
20.5% from Turkish 200310849 strain (Table 2).
Tetrapeptides RSKR251, RKLL523 and RKPL1043 were
identified in Kosova Hoti and are identical among all
strains in V. group. They represent the cleavage sites for
GP38, Gn and Gc proteins, respectively [21,22]. The
RKLL523 tetrapeptid of Kosova Hoti is typical for all
strains in group V (Europe/Turkey) but it differs from
RRLL tetrapeptid in all other CCHFV strains sequenced.
However, both tetrapeptides constitute a cleavage recognition site for subtilase SKI-1 [12,22,23]. Five transmembrane helices were predicted for polyprotein of Kosova
Hoti as shown on Figure 2.

Analysis of L protein encoded by the L segment of the Kosova Hoti strain revealed the conserved OTU-like protease
domain from aa 35 to 152 (Fig. 2). The identified
sequence G37DGN40CFYHSIAE.....151HFD with the catalytic triad (indicated in bold) was identical among all
CCHFV strains used in the L segment alignment (Fig. 1,
panel C). Amino-acids 2043–2714 corresponded to the
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalytic domain, similarly to the Nigerian IbAr10200 strain [24]. In addition, a
zinc finger C2H2-type domain (aa 609–632) was found
in the L protein of Kosova Hoti, but a previously identified leucine zipper could not be predicted. A leucine zipper motif (composed of three heptads) previously
identified at aa 1386–1407 in the L sequence of a Nigerian
strain [24,25], was not identified in the Kosova Hoti L
sequence. However, the L sequence of Kosova Hoti (and
other strains from group V) in this region differs from the
Nigerian strain only in the substitution of the leucine for
isoleucine at the position 1386.
Frequently it is observed that arthropod-borne viruses of
vertebrates exhibit low genetic diversity which is thought
to be due to essentially a double filter in operation,
whereby evolution of these viruses is tightly constrained
by the need to maintain high fitness in both vertebrate
and arthropod host environments [26]. The very high
genetic diversity seen in CCHFV is a strikingly exception.
Presumably less constraint or greater positive selection is
molding the evolutionary pattern of this virus. The complete genome of this representative CCHFV isolate (Kosova Hoti) from a highly endemic region of the Balkans is
clearly divergent from strains present in other endemic
regions of the world, and considerable sequence difference is even observed among virus strains found within
Kosovo. These findings have importance for design of
molecular diagnostic tools and vaccine development
efforts, as they clearly illustrate the need to consider the
high viral diversity and complexity of CCHF viral variant
geographic distribution in these efforts.
