The non-random clustering of non-synonymous
substitutions and its relationship to evolutionary
rate
Lisa G McFerrin1 and Eric A Stone1,2*

Abstract
Background: Protein sequences are subject to a mosaic of constraint. Changes to functional domains and buried
residues, for example, are more apt to disrupt protein structure and function than are changes to residues
participating in loops or exposed to solvent. Regions of constraint on the tertiary structure of a protein often result
in loose segmentation of its primary structure into stretches of slowly- and rapidly-evolving amino acids. This
clustering can be exploited, and existing methods have done so by relying on local sequence conservation as a
signature of selection to help identify functionally important regions within proteins. We invert this paradigm by
leveraging the regional nature of protein structure and function to both illuminate and make use of genome-wide
patterns of local sequence conservation.
Results: Our hypothesis is that the regional nature of structural and functional constraints will assert a positive
autocorrelation on the evolutionary rates of neighboring sites, which, in a pairwise comparison of orthologous
proteins, will manifest itself as the clustering of non-synonymous changes across the amino acid sequence. We
introduce a dispersion ratio statistic to test this and related hypotheses. Using genome-wide interspecific
comparisons of orthologous protein pairs, we reveal a strong log-linear relationship between the degree of
clustering and the intensity of constraint. We further demonstrate how this relationship varies with the evolutionary
distance between the species being compared. We provide some evidence that proteins with a history of positive
selection deviate from genome-wide trends.
Conclusions: We find a significant association between the evolutionary rate of a protein and the degree to which
non-synonymous changes cluster along its primary sequence. We show that clustering is a non-redundant
predictor of evolutionary rate, and we speculate that conflicting signals of clustering and constraint may be
indicative of a historical period of relaxed selection.

Background
For functional biological sequences, and for proteins in
particular, similarity in sequence is often predictive of
similarity in structure and function. This has great utility, because while it is challenging to glean knowledge
of structure and function, sequence information is comparatively easy to obtain. For this reason, and because
comparing two sequences in an alignment is straightforward, pairwise alignments are often the first step toward
annotating a sequence whose folded structure and

biological function are unknown. When two sequences
show extensive similarity and one of the two has been
annotated, transferring that annotation provides an easy
functional prediction; however, even in the complete
absence of annotation, alignments can be used to
ascribe functional importance to sites and regions in a
sequence [1]. Consider, for example, two distantlyrelated sequences, say a pair of orthologous genes in
human and chicken. Both the coding sequences of these
genes and the amino acid sequences that they encode
may be very different, yet particular stretches of residues
may be well conserved [2]. While such surprisingly similarity can arise by random chance, it may also be the
footprint of purifying selection, indicating a region of

the sequence that is functionally important and resistant
to evolutionary change.
In proteins, functionally and structurally important
residues are often organized into domains. Thus, in a
comparison of related sequences, domains may be
apparent as regions of surprising similarity. This style of
de novo annotation is exploited routinely and underlies
a number of web-accessible methods including but not
limited to the Evolutionary Trace (ET) [3-5] and Evolution-Structure-Function analysis (ESF) [6,7]. The success
of these methods relies upon two general characteristics
of protein sequences, namely (1) that there exists heterogeneity among the rates at which sites in a protein
evolve and (2) that the rates are spatially autocorrelated
(see Figure 1). Consequently, more sophisticated de
novo annotation schemes gain resolution through a
combination of improved evolutionary models, accounting for site autocorrelation, and respecting spatial proximities induced by tertiary structure, e.g. [8-10].
Just as surprising regional similarity in a pairwise
comparison may be of biological interest, interesting
biology may be responsible for regions that are surprisingly distinct. For example, in a comparison of closelyrelated species, say human and chimpanzee, one
expects a great deal of sequence similarity. In such a
background, sometimes regions of surprisingly dissimilarity may encode positively selected adaptations,
including those that have helped to distinguish us
from our primate cousins [11]. Within a protein-coding gene, there is evidence that sites undergoing diversifying positive selection, that is those evolving more
rapidly than the rate of neutral evolution would predict, cluster non-randomly along the primary sequence
[12,13]. The web-accessible tool SWAKK, which is
similar in spirit to ET and ESF, exploits this non-

random distribution to identify positively-selected
regions within a protein [14].
Synthesizing the above, there is evidence that both
negative purifying selection and positive diversifying
selection promote the clustering of amino acid differences in a pairwise comparison of protein sequences. By
contrast, in the absence of selection at the protein level
(e.g. for a pseudogene or fully redundant duplicate),
clustering is not expected, unless for example the mutation process is biased or there is selection on the encoding DNA. In a snapshot of evolutionary time, most
proteins are under purifying selection, whereby nonsynonymous mutations that change the encoded protein
are more likely to fix if they affect regions of the
sequence of functionally lesser importance. This raises
the possibility that for proteins under stronger purifying
selection the clustering of amino acid differences in a
pairwise comparison is more intense. To explore this
and other possibilities, we introduce a simple statistic
that quantifies the degree to which non-synonymous
changes are clustered in a pairwise alignment.
In this manuscript, we consider aligned pairs of putatively orthologous protein-coding sequences across a
variety of species. Within that focus, we hypothesize
that: (1) there exists a genome-wide trend relating the
intensity with which purifying selection acts on a protein sequence to the intensity with which non-synonymous changes are clustered in a pairwise alignment; (2)
gene pairs which have undergone periods of relaxed or
reversed constraint, such as might occur subsequent to
gene duplication, appear as deviations from the genomewide trend; and (3) the intensity with which non-synonymous changes are clustered in a pairwise alignment is
a strong non-redundant predictor of evolutionary rate.
Using our new “dispersion ratio” statistic, we provide

The dispersion ratio was calculated as r = ω I /ω A .
Within each genome-wide comparison, individual proteins were again excluded when either log(ω) or log(r)
had a standard error greater than one. Standard errors
for r and ω were approximated using the delta method
as

evidence in support of each hypothesis as well as show
that the hypotheses are robust to the choice of genomes
compared.

Methods
Genome-wide pairwise comparisons of selection and
dispersion

We obtained from Ensembl 46 pairwise codon alignments of all one-to-one orthologous protein coding
sequences between human and eight other species: Pan
troglodytes, Macaca mulatta, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Canis familiaris, Monodelphis domestica, Gallus
gallus, and Danio rerio. As illustrated in Figure 2, we
identified the sites in each alignment at which the
encoded amino acids were distinct; these comprise the
visible subset of all sites where a non-synonymous
change has taken place. We labeled as “adjacent” (a) all
sites adjacent to, but not necessarily including, any site
identified as non-synonymous by amino acid comparison; the remaining sites were labeled “isolated” (i). The
complete alignment was then partitioned into its adjacent and isolated components, yielding two disjoint subalignments. Within each genome-wide comparison,
individual proteins were excluded from consideration
unless the two subalignments each contained both a
transition and a transversion event.
We used the method of Yang and Nielsen [15], as
implemented in PAML (yn00, version 3.15), to estimate
Ka and Ks for each complete alignment (no partitioning) and its two subalignments. The subalignment Ka
and Ks estimates were denoted Ka A and Ks A , for the
Adjacent alignment, and KaI and KsI , for the Isolated
alignment. We obtained from PAML the standard errors
for each estimate as well. We computed ω = Ka/Ks for
the complete alignment, ωA = KaA/KsA for the adjacent

Saccharomyces data and analysis

We obtained from Kellis et al. [16] the protein-coding
genes and ortholog assignments (grouped by ORFs with
unambiguous correspondence) for four Saccharomyces
species: S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus, S. mikitae, and S.
bayanus. We considered only those proteins for which
all four sequences were present, and these were aligned
using ClustalW and subjected to phylogenetic analysis
assuming the fixed unrooted topology ((S. cerevisiae, S.
paradoxus), (S. mikitae, S. bayanus)). The method of
Goldman and Yang [17], as implemented in PAML
(codeml; version 3.15), was used to jointly infer “ancestral” sequences at the coalescence of cerevisiae/paradoxus and of mikitae/bayanus. This facilitated five
pairwise comparisons that collectively span the tree: (1)
cerevisiae vs. cerevisiae/paradoxus, (2) paradoxus vs. cerevisiae/paradoxus , (3) mikitae vs. mikitae/bayanus, (4)
bayanus vs. mikitae/bayanus, and (5) cerevisiae/paradoxus vs. mikitae/bayanus. Subsequently, KaA, KsA, KaI
and KsI were calculated for each. To compute a dispersion ratio for the tree, we first summed each of these
measures across the five branches comprising ((S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus), (S. mikitae, S. bayanus)). The dispersion ratio for each gene was thus given by (ΣKaI/ΣKsI)/

Comparing selection and dispersion for genes under
recent positive selection

Within the human/chimpanzee dataset gathered from
Ensembl, we identified those genes implicated as being
under positive selection in the human lineage [18]. We
then fit the model Y i = a + bXi + gP i + ε i , where the
response variable Yi is the log(ω) value for gene i, the
continuous predictor variable Xi is the log(r) value for
gene i, and

Comparing the dispersion ratio to established correlates
of evolutionary rate

Measures of protein-related attributes in Saccharomyces
cerevisae were collected from various sources (see Table 1).

Careful attention was paid to ensure that we chose exclusion criteria and data transformations consistent with
published studies. After exclusion and transformation,
each of the protein-related attributes described above was
investigated for correlation to both log(ω) and log(r)
(Table 1, rlog(ω), X and rlog(r), X, respectively). Partial correlations were computed between log(ω) and log(r) after
controlling for each of the protein-related attributes individually (Table 1, rlog(ω), log(r)|X).

Results
The dispersion ratio as a simple measure of clustering

In this section we introduce the dispersion ratio, a measure of the degree to which non-synonymous changes
are clustered in a pairwise alignment. The dispersion
ratio thus quantifies spatial heterogeneity, which is in
general a common and well-studied phenomenon. To
illustrate how we have adapted the concept, in Figure 2
we present a hypothetical 27aa protein sequence that is
composed of alternating rapidly- and slowly-evolving

A significant log-linear relationship between selection
and dispersion

To test hypothesis (1), we conducted a genome-wide
comparison between each human protein-coding gene
and its ortholog, when present and unambiguous, across
eight vertebrate species (Figure 3). We restricted ourselves to unique orthologs as designated by Ensembl
(see Methods) and used their previously computed
alignments. For each alignment, we used the model of
Yang and Nielsen [15] as implemented in PAML to
compute ω, ωI and ωA as described above. Each aligned
pair of orthologs thus provides a (ω, r) coordinate pair
that can be entered into a species-specific scatterplot of
genes. These eight scatterplots - one for each nonhuman species in the phylogeny of Figure 3 - show a
consistent, non-linear monotonic trend; as ω decreases,
so too does r, indicating that the degree to which nonsynonymous changes cluster increases with the strength
of purifying selection (data not shown). When the two
axes are log-transformed, so that log(r) is plotted
against log(ω), the relationship becomes linear and
highly significant. In Figure 4, log(r) is plotted against

segments. To construct the dispersion ratio from a pair
of aligned protein-coding sequences, we begin by identifying all positions j in the alignment at which the amino
acids disagree. We then label the sites adjacent to mismatches (i.e. sites j - 1 and j + 1 for each such j) with
an “a“. We next partition the alignment into two subalignments: one composed exclusively of the sites labeled
“a“, and one composed of the remaining sites, which we
label “i“ for isolated. Within each of these subalignments, we compute the ratio of the rate of non-synonymous substitutions to the rate of synonymous
substitutions (ωI and ωA for the isolated and adjacent
subalignments, respectively). The dispersion ratio r is
the ratio of ratios ωI/ωA. The dispersion ratio measures
the degree to which non-synonymous changes are clustered along a protein’s primary sequence. It specifically
quantifies the propensity for non-synonymous changes
to neighbor one another in a comparison of homologous
proteins. The philosophy of r can be conveyed through
Figure 2 by simply tallying where the non-synonymous
changes fall; there 2 of 13 isolated sites (15%) harbor a
non-synonymous change, as compared to 7 of 14 adjacent ones (50%), suggesting a dispersion ratio smaller
than one. As the name implies, larger values of r indicate that non-synonymous changes are more dispersed,
whereas smaller values indicate a greater degree of clustering. Supplied with this definition of r, we can
rephrase our first hypothesis as follows: if ω is the ratio
of the rate of non-synonymous substitutions to the rate
of synonymous substitutions for the entire protein, then
we hypothesize a genome-wide trend that relates ω to r.

not limited to the comparison of human and mouse.
Indeed, as Figure 5 shows, each of the eight comparisons provides strong evidence of a significant log-linear
trend relating our chosen measures of selection and dispersion. To isolate the effect of calibrating by synonymous substitution rates, Figure 5 also includes results
from alternative measures of selection and dispersion
based on unscaled protein divergence. These results,

Pairwise comparison with human
Figure 5 Genome-wide relationships between log(ω) and log(r) for eight pairwise comparisons. Each column reports the details of the
genome-wide comparison between human and the indicated species. Below each species, the number of orthologous protein pairs obtained
from Ensembl (N) and the number of pairs retained after exclusion (n) are shown. The squared correlation coefficient (R2) between log(r) and
log(ω) is shown and plotted in red. The R2 between log(KaI/KaA) and log(Ka) is plotted in blue. The R2 values between log(r) and log(ω)

permutation.

which compare log(KaI/KaA) to log(Ka) without regard
to synonymous substitution rates, show a similar but
weaker trend.
To emphasize the significance of our findings, the
scatterplot of Figure 4 in red presents a control. Our
control, constructed in the spirit of the dispersion ratio,
follows the construction illustrated in Figure 2 for
synonymous rather than for non-synonymous changes.
Thus, whereas r is created by first partitioning sites in
the alignment according to the location of non-synonymous changes, the synonymous dispersion ratio rS is
created by first partitioning sites according to where
synonymous changes are observed. Figure 4 plots log
(rS) against log(ω) in red for the human/mouse comparison. As the figure shows, the relationship is not significant (r = -0.0156; p-value = 0.087), suggesting that in
strong contrast to non-synonymous changes, the clustering of synonymous changes does not depend on the
intensity of purifying selection on the protein sequence.

As a final validation, we turned to a permutation-based
approach whereby the order of sites in each alignment
was shuffled. The effect of this, for any one aligned pair
of orthologs, is to hold ω fixed while varying r in a random, non-biological way. Permuting each aligned
human/mouse pair creates an alternative version of the
blue scatterplot in Figure 4; the observed correlation
can be thought of as a sample from a null distribution
under which selection and dispersion are not biologically related. We used 100 genome-wide permutations
to perform a non-parametric test of the null hypothesis
that the observed correlation between ω and r is consistent with a spatially random placement of non-synonymous changes. Owing to edge effects and the discrete
nature of the data, the expected correlation of ω and r
under the null hypothesis is biased away from zero;
nevertheless, the correlation observed in our original
data is uniformly and substantially larger than any of
the permuted realizations (i.e. p-value < 0.01, see Figure

5), and this persists regardless of the comparison. This,
once again, supports the existence of a genome-wide
trend relating the intensity with which purifying selection acts on a protein and the intensity with which nonsynonymous changes are clustered.
Genes under recent positive selection deviate from the
trend

In a pairwise comparison of protein-coding sequences, it
is difficult to disentangle the mode and tempo of the
evolutionary process. For example, genes under recent
positive selection in the human lineage may not appear
as such in a pairwise comparison if purifying selection is
acting upon the gene in the sister lineage. Put another
way, the pairwise comparison reflects the aggregated
effects of two evolutionary regimes, one in which the
protein evolves at a rate faster than expected under neutrality, and one in which the protein evolves at a rate
slower than expected under neutrality. As a consequence of this aggregation, the individual regimes that
compose such a mixed regime may be obscured, unless
of course additional information is incorporated in the
analysis. We hypothesize that the dispersion ratio provides useful information toward disentangling mixed
evolutionary regimes. Evidence of this comes from the

observation that both purifying selection and positive
selection appear to promote the clustering of nonsynonymous changes: if both regimes promote clustering, than the degree of clustering observed under a
mixed regime may be surprisingly large given the apparent intensity of selection. The stable relationship
between log(r) and log(ω) presented previously suggests
that log(ω) can be predicted from log(r); in a pairwise
comparison that spans a mixed regime, log(ω) may be
appear too large when compared to a prediction based
on the value of log(r) that was observed. In other
words, we hypothesized that a mixed regime might lead
to evolutionary rates that are “too fast” for the degree of
clustering observed.
As a test of this hypothesis, we turned to a set of protein-coding genes implicated as being under positive
selection in the human lineage after the human/chimpanzee split [18,19]. Reversing the axes from Figure 4,
in Figure 6 we identified these genes in a human/chimpanzee scatterplot of log(ω) vs. log(r) (see Methods).
Qualitatively, the positively-selected genes (in orange)
appear to have larger-than-average values of ω for any
given r; quantitatively, we assessed this using a linear
model that includes an indicator variable. Letting Xi and
Y i denote the log(r) and log(ω) values for gene i,

respectively, and defining the indicator to be Pi be equal
to one if gene i was deemed to be under recent positive
selection and equal to zero otherwise, we tested whether
g = 0 in the linear model Yi = a + bXi + gP i + εi. We
were able to reject the null hypothesis g = 0 when tested
against the biological one-sided alternative g < 0 (pvalue < 0.00467), concluding that as compared to the
overall clustering trend the rates of “mixed-regime”
genes appear to be elevated.
The dispersion ratio is a non-redundant predictor of
evolutionary rate

Recall that, as depicted in Figure 2a, one interpretation
of the dispersion ratio is that it captures the latent segmentation of rate classes within a protein sequence.
This segmentation, in turn, may be due to constraints
on a protein’s structure and function. Viewed in this
way, it is not unreasonable to consider the dispersion
ratio as a crude but informative surrogate of the structural constraints acting upon a protein. We have provided evidence that this structural surrogate is predictive
of the rate at which a protein evolves (i.e. ω), and we
have shown that the clustering measured by r is independent of ω when the sequences have been permuted
(i.e. in the absence of structuring). In this section, we
investigate how r compares with other established correlates of evolutionary rate.
We have structured this comparison to bring it in
accord with the literature. The manuscripts we sought
to parallel collectively introduce a diverse set of potential correlates of a protein’s evolutionary rate. The measures we consider span a wide range of protein-related
attributes, including mRNA expression level [20], protein abundance [21], translational efficiency (as measured by the codon adaptation index) [22,23],
dispensability (i.e. fitness when deleted) [24,25],
sequence length [26], the number of protein-protein
interaction partners [27], the protein’s contact density
[28], the fraction of residues in the protein that are at
least 25% buried, and the fraction of residues involved
in various secondary structure elements (helix, strand,
turn, coil) [28]. In addition to correlating these attributes both to log(r) and log(ω), we considered each as a
controlling variable to test the persistence of a significant log-linear relationship between r and ω in yeast.
The yeast dataset we employ comes from [16] and
includes annotated protein-coding genes from four Saccharomyces species: S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus, S. mikitae, and S. bayanus. We again focused on groups of
unique orthologs, and because here for each proteincoding gene we have four sequences instead of two, we
were forced to extend the dispersion ratio beyond pairwise comparisons. Our approach was to treat the
unrooted phylogeny from [16], ((S. cerevisiae, S.

Page 8 of 10

paradoxus), (S. mikitae, S. bayanus)), as representing
five separate pairwise comparisons to be aggregated
(though see Discussion for alternatives). To accomplish
this required us to infer the sequences at the internal
nodes of the tree, and we did so under a probabilistic
model from [29], using the algorithm of [30]. For each
pair of sequences spanning a branch on the tree, we
partitioned their alignment as in Figure 2 to obtain four
values: (1) KaA, the adjacent rate of non-synonymous
changes, (2) Ks A , the adjacent rate of synonymous
changes, (3) KaI, the isolated rate of non-synonymous
changes, and (4) KsI , the isolated rate of synonymous
changes. Note that whereas before we combined these
to compute r, here we have kept them separate so that
each can be summed across the tree. In this way, we
computed the dispersion ratio for each yeast proteincoding gene as (ΣKaI/ΣKsI)/(ΣKaA/ΣKaA).
As before, we find a highly significant log-linear relationship between the dispersion ratio and evolutionary
rate. To test whether or not that relationship persists
after controlling for the aforementioned protein-related
attributes, we used the method of partial correlation.
Specifically, we computed the partial correlation
between log(r) and log(ω) after controlling for each of
the protein-related attributes in Table 1. The results
show that the log-linear relationship between selection
and dispersion remains highly significant even after controlling for a variety of established evolutionary correlates. The strength of that relationship, in comparison to
those observed for other attributes, is remarkable (see
Table 1) and suggests that the dispersion ratio is capturing an important determinant of evolutionary rate.

Discussion
As a protein-coding gene evolves, non-synonymous substitutions do not accumulate uniformly along its
sequence. There is heterogeneity among the rates at
which individual sites within a protein evolve, and part
of that heterogeneity is induced by structural and functional constraints. Though the structural and functional
domains that comprise proteins are contingent upon
tertiary folding, there is enrichment within domains for
residues that are contiguous along the primary
sequence. As such, within proteins there exists rate
autocorrelation that can be, and has been, exploited to
annotate regions of putative importance.
In a pairwise comparison of protein-coding genes, rate
heterogeneity manifests in the non-random placement
of non-synonymous changes. One expects a dearth of
such changes in regions of structural and functional
importance and a relative excess where the intensity of
selection is less. The aggregation of changes outside of
important regions may lead to the appearance that nonsynonymous changes are clustering. We speculated that

McFerrin and Stone BMC Genomics 2011, 12:415
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/415

the appearance of clustering would increase with an
increasing intensity of selection, and we developed the
dispersion ratio to test that hypothesis. Confirming our
speculation, we found a highly-significant log-linear relationship between the dispersion ratio and evolutionary
rate. This relationship was observed to be robust to
both choice of species and degree of evolutionary
divergence.
Just as purifying selection acts to cluster substitutions
along the sequence of a protein, there is evidence that
diversifying selection leads to clustering as well. This led
us to consider the case of genes whose modes of evolution differ on sister lineages. In cases when the evolutionary trajectory spanned by a pairwise comparison
contains a mixture of purifying and diversifying selection, we hypothesized an effect on the relationship
between the dispersion ratio and evolutionary rate. Having already observed that the degree to which nonsynonymous changes cluster is predictive of the rate at
which a protein is evolving, we reasoned that for mixed
regimes such predictions would be biased downward. At
least for the data we examined, this turned out to be the
case: for genes under positive selection in the human
lineage, the evolutionary rate estimated from a human/
chimpanzee comparison was greater than what the
degree of clustering would predict.
To place in perspective the contribution of the dispersion ratio as a predictor of evolutionary rate, we compared its explanatory power to those of a diverse set of
protein-related attributes. In doing so, we found log(r)
to be a highly-significant and non-redundant correlate
of the logarithmic rate, log(ω). The correlation between
log(r) and log(ω), and its persistence after conditioning
on other correlates of evolutionary rate, speaks to either
a determinant of evolutionary rate that has not yet been
characterized or a deficiency in the way evolutionary
rate has been quantified in this particular set of studies.
Whatever the case, it appears that non-synonymous
clustering is a reliable, non-redundant, sequence-based
predictor of ω.
Because the dispersion ratio behaves differently under
neutrality and under purifying selection, and because
permutations can be used to populate a sensible null
distribution, one can envision using the dispersion ratio
in a test of selection. Nevertheless, we did not devise r
as a statistic to test the behavior of individual genes,
and such tests, though conceivable, would likely be
underpowered and inferior to existing methods (e.g.
[12,31]). These methods, unlike ours, were specifically
designed to identify the presence of clustered substitutions and test their significance against an appropriate
null hypothesis about a specific gene. By contrast, we
were motivated by simplicity and proposed the dispersion ratio as an intuitive means of testing the existence

Page 9 of 10

of genome-wide evolutionary trends, without regard to
any particular gene. Other measures of clustering are
likely to perform similarly, and indeed we observe similar results to those presented when r is replaced by a
model-based measure of autocorrelation (taken from
[32]; data not shown).
The intuition behind our statistic and its relationship
to evolutionary rate is grounded in dependencies
induced by protein tertiary structure. Though r is a
function of sequence and not structure, the dispersion
ratio, like the methods from which it was inspired (e.g.
ET, ESF, SWAKK), leverages the fact that adjacent residues in the sequence are structurally proximal. It seems
reasonable that a structurally-informed analog of the
dispersion ratio would be superior to r in validating the
hypotheses of this manuscript, but we did not find this
to be the case (data not shown). This may be due to,
among other possibilities, the limited number of structures available or the manner in which we extended our
statistic.
In interpreting the results presented here, it should be
noted that all of our analyses were contingent upon
sequence alignment. Because alignment uncertainty
tends to increase with sequence divergence, to the
extent that alignment errors affect neighboring sites,
one expects a spurious non-biological correlation
between ω and r. While alignment error may indeed
contribute to the signal we observe, we do not believe it
to play a major role. Several of our analyses feature very
closely related species whose orthologous proteins are
predominantly the same length. For these proteins, the
alignment is unambiguous, unless there was both an
insertion and deletion event.

Conclusions
In summary, we have proposed a simple statistic that
quantifies the degree of non-synonymous clustering in a
pairwise comparison, and we did so to test hypotheses
about how clustering varies with evolutionary rate. We
found ample evidence of a strong log-linear relationship,
and we tested the robustness and validity of our observations in a number of ways. To investigate generality,
we considered eight vertebrate pairwise comparisons
spanning a wide range of evolutionary divergence, as
well as a comparison of four Saccharomyces yeast. To
investigate potential artifacts, we used as controls both a
permutation approach and a synonymous dispersion statistic. To investigate methodological dependence, we
considered alternatives to the dispersion ratio, including
the idea of simply “counting” synonymous and nonsynonymous changes as suggested by Nei and Gojobori
[33] and by Li [34] (data not shown). In every case, for
every comparison, we find that non-synonymous clustering intensifies with increasing purifying selection. The

ubiquity of this relationship supports the concept of a
loose segmentation model for protein sequences as well
as the use of de novo annotation methods that have
implicitly capitalized upon it.
