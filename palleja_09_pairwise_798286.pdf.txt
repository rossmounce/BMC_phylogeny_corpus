Abstract
Background: Although prokaryotes live in a variety of habitats and possess different metabolic
and genomic complexity, they have several genomic architectural features in common. The
overlapping genes are a common feature of the prokaryote genomes. The overlapping lengths tend
to be short because as the overlaps become longer they have more risk of deleterious mutations.
The spacers between genes tend to be short too because of the tendency to reduce the non coding
DNA among prokaryotes. However they must be long enough to maintain essential regulatory
signals such as the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, which is responsible of an efficient translation.
Description: PairWise Neighbours is an interactive and intuitive database used for retrieving
information about the spacers and overlapping genes among bacterial and archaeal genomes. It
contains 1,956,294 gene pairs from 678 fully sequenced prokaryote genomes and is freely available
at the URL http://genomes.urv.cat/pwneigh. This database provides information about the overlaps
and their conservation across species. Furthermore, it allows the wide analysis of the intergenic
regions providing useful information such as the location and strength of the SD sequence.
Conclusion: There are experiments and bioinformatic analysis that rely on correct annotations of
the initiation site. Therefore, a database that studies the overlaps and spacers among prokaryotes
appears to be desirable. PairWise Neighbours database permits the reliability analysis of the
overlapping structures and the study of the SD presence and location among the adjacent genes,
which may help to check the annotation of the initiation sites.

Background
The availability of fully sequenced genomes has grown
exponentially over the past few years. There is a huge variety of environments for the prokaryote species, as well as
different metabolic and genomic complexities. However,
prokaryote genomes have common architectural principles [1]. The prokaryote genomes contain protein-coding
genes, structural RNAs and spacers between genes which

are thought to typically contain regulatory signals [2] and
the origin of replication sequence [3]. These spacers tend
to be short because of the selective pressure to minimize
the non-functional DNA in prokaryotes [2,4]. It is a consistent feature of these genomes that the genes often overlap their coding sequences [5]. Under this scenario of
genomic compactness due to their physically small environments, the overlapping genes follow the rules that

impose the structure of the genetic code and the spacers
between genes must adapt their lengths to the requirements of the regulatory signals [2].
One of the regulatory signals that we can find between
genes is the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence [6]. The SD
sequence is a motif, 5'-GGAGG-3', located at the 5' of the
initiation codons and is complementary to the sequence,
5'-CCUCC-3', located at the end of the 16S rRNAs [6]. The
ribosome does not need a perfect distance between the SD
sequence and the start codon for the initiation of translation. However, it has been studied that when the SD
resides within the 4 nucleotides from the initiation codon
or when it is located as far as 13 nucleotides from the initiation codon, gene expression is decreased drastically [79]. The prokaryote species seem to have preferred distances between the SD and the start codon and these distances vary among the species [10], although this
sequence has been found mostly from the 7th to the 12th
base upstream from the start codon [10-12]. The location
of the SD can help to correct the gene annotations [13]
and could influence the spacing length and the stop
codon usage [14].
Among the prokaryote genomes there is a huge amount of
examples of overlapping genes [15-19]. The overlapping
lengths tend to be short because of the selective pressure
against long overlaps, as the existence of long overlapping
reading frames increases the risk of deleterious mutations.
The co-directional overlaps are the most common overlaps, which reflect that this is the most common orientation for a gene pair due to the tendency to be grouped in
operons in prokaryote genomes [20-22]. Among the codirectional overlaps the 4 bps overlap is extremely common [5,15,23,24], which permits the upstream stop
codon and the downstream start codon overlap and the
gene pair is thought to be translationally coupled [25].
The co-directional and divergent overlapping genes can
arise by 5'-end elongations when the downstream gene
adopts a new start codon within the upstream coding
sequence [23], while the co-directional and the convergent overlapping genes can arise by 3'-end extensions after
a loss codon event [16]. Overlaps in prokaryotes have
been hypothesized to be involved in reducing the genome
size in order to increase the density of genetic information
[17,24,26-28], and in regulating gene expression through
translational coupling of functionally related polypeptides [5,24,26,29,30]. In addition, other authors have
used the overlapping pairs as genetic markers for phylogenetic inferences due to its high conservation [31,32].
Overlapping genes are better conserved across the species
than non-overlapping genes [19]. The extent of conservation of the overlapping pairs correlates with the evolutionary distances between the pairs of species [15].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/281

The overlapping genes, as a common structure of the
prokaryote genomes, and the spacers between genes are
structural features worth studying in prokaryotes. However, the analysis of both the overlapping genes and the
spacers between genes is often affected by genome annotation errors [33-35]. An accurate annotation would facilitate the experiments as well as the bioinformatic analysis
of gene regulation and gene structure [36]. In this interactive database is stored all the overlapping genes and the
spacers of 678 fully sequenced prokaryote genomes. The
aim of this database is to provide the users with useful
information about the overlapping genes and the spacing
lengths between adjacent genes. The conservation of the
overlaps across the species and the SD presence and location within the intergenic regions or the overlapping
sequences can be analysed. Obviously, the quality of the
information given depends on the quality of the genome
annotations. In fact, this database can be used to analyse
suspicious cases of genome annotation errors such as
wrong initiation sites or false gene predictions.

Construction and content
Retrieval of the Spacing lengths and the Overlapping
genes
The complete genome sequences of 678 prokaryote
genomes were downloaded from the NCBI ftp site ftp://
ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/. Scripts implemented in
Perl language were performed to extract and analyse the
spacers and the overlaps between adjacent genes and all
the information related (spacing & overlapping lengths,
spacing & overlapping sequences, gene orientations,
phases, protein functions, gene COGS and stop & start
codons of the genes). The internal gene ids in this database have been formed by joining the GenBank Accession
Number with the gene name. For instance, the gene id for
the HI0038 gene from Haemophilus influenzae Rd KW20 is
NC_000907.HI0038. Furthermore, each overlap and
spacer between adjacent genes has an internal id. The
spacing lengths and the overlapping genes have been classified into three types according to their transcriptional
direction [2,16,26]: i) unidirectional (genes in the same
strand overlapping the 3'-end of an upstream gene and the
5'-end of a downstream gene), ii) convergent (genes in
opposite strand overlapping the 3'-ends) and iii) divergent (genes in opposite strand overlapping the 5'-ends).
In this database we use the term co-directional instead of
the unidirectional term. In order to study the phases
between adjacent genes, as other authors have previously
done [5,19,23], we defined three overlapping phases: (i)
phase 0 where the downstream gene is in frame with the
upstream gene (lengths n = ..., -12, -9, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, 9, 12,
...), (ii) phase 1 where the downstream gene is in the reading frame +1 relative to the upstream gene frame (lengths
n = ..., -11, -8, -5, -2, 1, 4, 7, 10, ...) and (iii) phase 2 where
the downstream gene is in the reading frame +2 relative to

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:281

the upstream gene frame (lengths n = ..., -10, -7, -4, -1, 2,
5, 8, 11, ...).
Location of the SD sequence and determination of its
binding strength
We extracted the 16S rRNAs from the NCBI ftp site ftp://
ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/. For each 16S rRNA
sequence of each organism we looked at the 5' direction
for the first instance of the three letter motif, 5'-GAU-3',
which was found consistently on the 5' end tails of the
16S rRNAs with known structures. The location of this
motif was used to define, up to the end of the 3' tail, the
16S rRNA tail of each organism. For species that have two
or more copies of the 16S rRNA gene, we calculated the
consensus sequence of all the tails. If the different tails
observed did not follow a consensus, then we used the
majority of the 16S rRNA gene tails. All the 16S rRNA tails
of the 678 organisms were examined manually. The SD
sequences for 678 prokaryote genomes have been predicted using computer calculations of the base pairing free
energy between translation initiation regions and the 16S
rRNA 3' tail. The method used was developed by Starmer
and co-workers [12]; and the scripts to calculate the free
energies were downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/
projects/free2bind/ and were included in our Perl scripts.
We located the SD sequence by the position of the lowest
ΔG° value calculated from 35 bps upstream to the initiation codon to 35 bps downstream from the initiation
codon. The gene was assumed not to have the SD
sequence if ΔG° > -3.4535 Kcal/mol and to have SD
sequence if ΔG° ≤ -3.4535 Kcal/mol. The threshold used
is based on the work of Ma and co-workers [10]. The gene
was assumed to have a strong SD sequence if ΔG° ≤ -8.4
Kcal/mol, which is the value obtained from the optimal
base pairing between the 16S rRNA and the original SD
sequence 5'-GGAGGU-3' [13]. In order to point the exact
SD position we used the relative spacing parameter [13],
that means that we calculated the distance between the
first residue of the start codon and the 5' A of the rRNA
sequence 5'-ACCUCC-3' in each position around the start
codon. If the SD motif is located before the start codon the
relative spacing will be negative, while if the SD motif is
located after the start codon the relative spacing will be
given as a positive number. Regardless the gene pair orientation, the SD information and the graph of the ΔG° values is given for the upstream and the downstream gene.
Database Construction
The huge amount of data generated required a data model
to make it possible to work with this data efficiently. The
Entity-relationship model, showed in Figure 1, was
designed and transformed in a MySQL database. A web
application was developed using the framework web TurboGears. This Python framework MVC (Model-View-Controller) is an advanced tool to create data consulting

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/281

systems quickly, efficiently and consistently. The BLAST
search tool [37] was installed in our server and is used to
study the conservation of the gene overlaps. All the graphs
are generated at the user side by a Java Script library
named PlotKit.

Utility
We have developed an interactive and intuitive database
that currently contains 1,956,294 gene pairs from 678
fully sequenced microbial genomes. The database is freely
available at the URL http://genomes.urv.cat/pwneigh.
Basically, this database provides information about the
overlapping genes and the spacers between genes among
the prokaryote genomes. Users can access to the information through three browsers and an advanced search
engine, which are described below. In addition, this database offers the possibility of downloading the raw data
and a Database Schema (Figure 1) in the Downloads section. They can find information about the overlaps and
the spacers with the species name or the GenBank Accession Number, with the gene id (they can use the gene
name, the short gene name or the PID) or with the internal gene id (described above in the Construction and
Content section). While the users are typing the species
name or any gene id the search engine helps to complete
the name or the id. Interestingly, by clicking on the "TagClouds", the user can get a list of the species contained in
the database, which can be sorted by the number of overlaps in a genome or by genome length in order to check at
a glance the genomes with more overlaps or longer
genomes. Furthermore, the database is able to provide the
users with reports in TSV format at every step of their consultation just on clicking the Download TSV Data buttons.
The Genome browse
With this browser, users can find general information
about the genomes and connect to the overlapping genes
or the spacers between genes contained in the genome.
They can access this information by typing the name of
the species (by tax name) or the GenBank Accession
Number (by genbank). If they do not remember the species name or the GenBank Accession Number by clicking
on "Genome (List)" the users can consult an exhaustive
list of the species contained in this database and their
GenBank Accession Numbers. Once the user has made a
genome search, the first page obtained gives basic features
of the genome including the Species name, the GenBank
Accession Number, the TaxID, the genome length, the
number of ORFs in the chromosome, the number of overlaps and spacers in the genome, the overlaps between
ORFs ratio in the chromosome and the number of codirectional, convergent and divergent overlaps tabulated
and represented graphically. By clicking the number of
overlaps a list of the overlaps contained in the genome is
displayed on a new page, while on clicking the number of

spacers a list of the spacers contained in the genome is displayed on another new page.
The overlapping genes browse
The users can analyse the overlapping genes in a genome
or a particular overlap of interest (by gene or by internal
id). Once the user has made a genome search, the first
page obtained has a list of the overlaps with the overlapping genes and their orientations as well as the distribution of the overlapping lengths represented graphically.
The representation of the overlapping length distribution
gives a general idea about the most common overlaps and
the most common overlapping phases in the genome.
Each overlap id leads to a detailed new page of the overlap
including five labels that provide: overlap information,
upstream gene information, upstream gene sequence,
downstream gene information and downstream gene
sequence. The overlap information label (General Info
label) provides the internal id, chromosome name, the
orientation, the overlapping phase, the overlapping
length and the overlapping sequence. The upstream and
downstream gene information labels (Upstream Gene and
Downstream Gene label respectively) show the gene name,
the gene function, the gene COG, the stop codon and the

start codon. Also, on these labels is given information
related to the SD location (position of the minimal ΔG°
value and minimal ΔG° value) and the ΔG° values in the
translation initiation region is represented graphically.
The SD related information will be given in the upstream
or in the downstream label depending on the gene pair
orientation. The labels Fasta Up and Fasta Down contain
the upstream and the downstream gene sequence in fasta
format. Above the sequences there is a BLAST button. By
clicking on it, the gene sequence is directly pasted in the
BLAST local search engine and the conservation of one
overlap across the species can be analysed. Interestingly,
in the PairWise Neighbours database, the user can define
the Expected threshold of the BLAST search engine among
other features. Therefore the user can decide the threshold
used to study the similarity among orthologous genes in
order to analyse the overlapping pair conservation. In the
BLAST results, by clicking on any hit, the information of
the overlap is displayed on a new page.
The spacers browse
The users can analyse the spacers between adjacent genes
in a genome or a particular spacer of interest (by gene or
by internal id). If the user makes a genome search, a bar

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:281

chart of the spacing lengths of the genome is shown and
the user can have a first view of the most common spacers
in the genome. Below a list of all the spacers in the
genome is displayed, providing the internal id, the genes
separated by the spacer and their orientation. By clicking
any internal id all the information about the spacer is displayed on a new page. On this page there are three labels
that give information about: the spacer, the upstream
gene and the downstream gene. Basically the information
given in the fields on a general information label (General
Info label) is the same as the fields on a General Info label
of an overlap. However, the user can find the Spacing
length instead of the Overlapping length and Spacer
sequence instead of Overlapping sequence. The information provided on the Upstream and Downstream Gene
labels is the same as that on the overlap labels and the SD
related information is also given depending on the gene
pair orientation.
Advanced Search engine
In this Advanced Search it is possible to study the functionality of the genes more widely. The user can make correlations between the COG classes and the gene
orientations or between the COG classes and the overlapping or spacing lengths among the prokaryote genomes.
Furthermore, the user can retrieve the gene set of each
organism without SD sequence, with SD sequence and
with a strong SD sequence by just selecting the organism
and the corresponding energy threshold (the energy
thresholds are explained above in the Construction and
Content section).

Discussion
In this Discussion section we give a few examples that we
find interesting to illustrate the uses that can be attributed
to the PairWise Neighbours database.
Conservation of gene overlaps
The first one is about the gene couple NC_000913.b0043
and NC_000913.b0044 of E. coli K12, which code for two
proteins 4Fe-4S ferredoxin-type and have the COG ids
COG0644C and COG2440C respectively (Figure 2).
These genes are overlapping 4 bps. From the upstream
and downstream sequence labels it is easy to study the
conservation of the gene pair, using the BLAST button.
The BLAST results show 24 genes with high similarity (E
Value < 2e-7) to the NC_000913.b0043 gene and 33 genes
with high similarity (E Value < 4e-5) to the
NC_000913.b0044 gene (Figure 2). By clicking on a gene
id in the BLAST results, information about the overlap
that involves the gene is displayed on a new page. Most of
the genes similar to the NC_000913.b0043 gene have
their adjacent gene in the group of similar genes to the
NC_000913.b0044 gene and the majority of these gene
pairs are overlapping 4 bps. Therefore it is a conserved

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/281

overlap, particularly across the Enterobacteria species.
Interestingly, we also find high conservation in the location of the SD sequence. Analysing the SD information for
the NC_000913.b0044 gene (Downstream Gene label in
Figure 2) we observe a drop in ΔG° value at 9 nucleotides
to the start codon. This SD position is conserved among
Enterobacteria species. Figure 2 shows the information for
the NC_003197.STM0078 gene of Salmonella typhimurium
LT2, which overlaps 4 bps with the NC_003197.STM0077
gene. These genes are similar to the E. coli K12 gene pair
analysed. The NC_003197.STM0078 gene shows a drop
in ΔG° value at 9 nucleotides to the start codon, as it happens in the NC_000913.b0044 gene of E. coli K12. This
indicates that the SD sequence is located along the 3'-end
of a previous coding sequence and it might suggest that
the SD locations of conserved gene pairs can also be
highly conserved.
The second example is about the gene couple
NC_002947.PP_2780 and NC_002947.PP_2781 of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 that overlap 130 bps. This overlap
is the product of a misprediction of the start codon of the
gene NC_002947.PP_2781 causing a 5'-end extension of
the gene [35]. If we use the sequence of this gene as a
query for the BLAST, we obtain as a first hit the orthologous gene NC_009512.Pput_2974, which is 127 bps
shorter (compared with NC_002947.PP_2781) at the 5'end and it is adjacent to the NC_009512.Pput_2975 gene
(Figure 3). This gene pair (NC_009512.Pput_2974 and
NC_009512.Pput_2975) belongs to P. putida F1 and overlaps only 4 bps, which is more reliable than the overlap of
130 bps. This is an example of a mispredicted overlap
(NC_002947.PP_2780 and NC_002947.PP_2781) that
could be corrected by just analyzing the BLAST results that
we obtain automatically in this database, assuming that
the orthologous gene has a correct prediction of the start
site. In this case, the SD sequence prediction indicates that
the NC_002947.PP_2781 gene has no SD sequence, while
its orthologous gene (NC_009512.Pput_2974) has a
strong SD sequence at 7 nucleotides to the start codon
(Figure 3). Therefore, SD sequence location may help to
expose wrong start codon predictions [13], as in the case
of the NC_002947.PP_2781 gene, and to reinforce start
codon predictions [38], as in the case of the orthologous
gene (NC_009512.Pput_2974).
Relationship between SD positions and the spacing lengths
The third example is about the genes NC_000913.b2644
and NC_000913.b4548 of E. coli K12. These genes are separated by 8 bps (Figure 4), which is a short intergenic distance
for
a
co-directional
gene
pair.
The
NC_000913.b4548 label shows that there is a drop in
ΔG° value at 6 bps to the start codon (Figure 4). This
means that the SD sequence of this gene is overlapping
the upstream stop codon (TGA). If we join the upstream

NC_000913.b0044 genes (A). The BLAST results give an idea of the conservation of the overlap across the species (B). Information given on the NC_000913.b0044Downstream Gene label provides gene details (gene function, gene COG, start and stop
codon), SD related information (position of minimal ΔG° value, minimal ΔG° value) as well as a graph of the ΔG° values along
translation initiation region (C). The same information is given for the NC_003197.STM078 gene (D), which is an orthologous
gene of NC_000913.b0044.
stop codon, the intergenic sequence and the downstream
start codon we have the sequence TGAGGTATTACATG
(Figure 4). The upstream stop codon is overlapping the
SD motif resulting in the pattern TGAGGT that can bind
with the SD sequence 3'-CCUCCA-5'. Therefore here we
have detected a co-directional gene pair of E. coli K12
whose SD sequence for the downstream gene overlaps the
upstream stop codon.
SD presence among different gene sets
Other uses of the PairWise Neighbours database are to
find out SD information of gene sets of interest, which

have been labelled in other databases. For instance, the
gene NC_000913.b3297 of E. coli K12 has been labelled
as a highly expressed gene (HEG) in the HEG database [39].
This gene codifies for the 30S ribosomal protein S11 and
has a strong SD sequence (the drop of ΔG° value is -11.44
Kcal/mol) at 10 nucleotides upstream to the start codon.
If we analyse the SD presence in the E. coli K12 genes predicted as HEG in the HEG database (Table 1) [39], we find
that the 81.03% of these genes have the SD sequence. This
percentage is significantly higher compared with all the E.
coli K12 genes (69.66%) and with the mean and standard
deviation of the SD presence in 100 sets of 300 E. coli K12

Study of3 130 bps incorrectly annotated overlap
Figure a
Study of a 130 bps incorrectly annotated overlap. The BLAST results show that the gene NC_002947.PP_2781 of P. putida KT2440 is longer than its orthologous gene NC_009512.Pput_2974 in P. putida F1 (A). This difference in length indicates
that the 130 bps overlap between NC_002947.PP_2780 and NC_002947.PP_2781 is not conserved and thus not reliable. In
the NC_002947.PP_2781Downstream Gene label is shown that this gene has no SD sequence (B), while in the
NC_009512.Pput_2974 upstream gene label is shown that this gene has the SD sequence at 7 nucleotides to the start codon
(C).

genes randomly selected (69.04% ± 2.58%) (Table 1).
Therefore, as other authors have already found [10], the
HEGs appear to have more SD presence. Another interesting gene set that can be analysed in this database is the
horizontally transferred genes (HGTs). We studied the SD
presence among the E. coli K12 genes predicted as HGTs
in the HGT database [40]. The percentage of HGTs that
have SD sequence (68.39%) is close to the percentage of
SD presence found in all the E. coli K12 genes. This percentage falls within the range of the mean and the standard deviation of 100 sets of 300 genes randomly selected
from E. coli K12 (Table 1). Therefore, it seems that the
HGTs have an equal SD presence to the original genes of
the species.

Conclusion
The studies of the translation initiation mechanism, gene
regulation and gene structure (such operon predictions)
rely on correct annotations. With the growing number of
fully sequenced prokaryote genomes, the databases that
help the annotation processes are very desirable. PairWise
Neighbours is an interactive and intuitive database for
retrieving information about the spacers and overlapping
genes among bacterial and archaeal genomes. With this
information, on the one hand, it is possible to study the
reliability of an overlap as well as its conservation across
the species with a BLAST local system, which permits the
user to study the conservation of an overlap applying their
desired Expect threshold. On the other hand, with the

information related to the SD sequence and the ΔG° values along the translation initiation region, the users can
analyse the intergenic regions widely. They can check the
reliability of the initiation site prediction, the SD location
and the SD strength or the relationship between SD location and the spacing lengths. In addition, it is possible to
analyse the gene functions using the COG classes and the
SD predictions.
