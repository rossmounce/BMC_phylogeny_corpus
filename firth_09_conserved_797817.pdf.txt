Abstract
Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, Usutu and Murray Valley encephalitis viruses form a tight
subgroup within the larger Flavivirus genus. These viruses utilize a single-polyprotein expression
strategy, resulting in ~10 mature proteins. Plotting the conservation at synonymous sites along the
polyprotein coding sequence reveals strong conservation peaks at the very 5' end of the coding
sequence, and also at the 5' end of the sequence encoding the NS2A protein. Such peaks are
generally indicative of functionally important non-coding sequence elements. The second peak
corresponds to a predicted stable pseudoknot structure whose biological importance is supported
by compensatory mutations that preserve the structure. The pseudoknot is preceded by a
conserved slippery heptanucleotide (Y CCU UUU), thus forming a classical stimulatory motif for 1 ribosomal frameshifting. We hypothesize, therefore, that the functional importance of the
pseudoknot is to stimulate a portion of ribosomes to shift -1 nt into a short (45 codon), conserved,
overlapping open reading frame, termed foo. Since cleavage at the NS1-NS2A boundary is known
to require synthesis of NS2A in cis, the resulting transframe fusion protein is predicted to be NS1NS2AN-term-FOO. We hypothesize that this may explain the origin of the previously identified NS1
'extension' protein in JEV-group flaviviruses, known as NS1'.

Findings
The genus Flavivirus (see [1-3] for reviews) includes species such as Dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus
(JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), Tick-borne encephalitis
virus and Yellow fever virus. Also within the family Flaviviridae are Hepatitis C, Hepatitis G and the Pestivirus
genus. The Japanese encephalitis group includes JEV,
WNV, Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), Usutu
virus and St Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV). These important human pathogens are transmitted by mosquitoes and
can cause potentially fatal encephalitis. The single-

stranded positive sense genomic RNA is ~11 kb in length
and contains a single long open reading frame, translated
as a polyprotein that is cleaved by virus-encoded and host
proteases to produce ~10 mature proteins.
Inspired by the 'suppression of synonymous site variation'
(SSSV) statistic of ref. [4], we decided to investigate conservation at synonymous sites in the Flaviviridae family.
For a given species or group within the family, the polyprotein coding sequences (CDSs) were extracted, translated, aligned with CLUSTALW [5], and back-translated to

nucleotide sequence alignments. Beginning with pairwise
sequence comparisons, conservation at synonymous sites
(only) was evaluated by comparing the observed number
of base substitutions with the number expected under a
neutral evolution model. The procedure takes into
account whether synonymous site codons are 1-, 2-, 3-, 4or 6-fold degenerate and the differing probabilities of
transitions and transversions (full details are available on
request from the authors). Statistics were then summed
over a phylogenetic tree as described in [6], and averaged
over a sliding window.
When this procedure was applied to the JEV group
(excepting SLEV; see below), two striking peaks in synonymous site conservation were found – one within the capsid CDS (very 5' end of the polyprotein CDS) and one at
the 5' end of the NS2A CDS (Figure 1A). The peak within
the capsid CDS is a common feature of flavivirus
genomes, with this sequence region playing important
roles in replication and, for some species, translation initiation (reviewed in [1]). On the other hand, the peak
within the NS2A CDS was either not present, or not so
pronounced, outside of the JEV group. One unexplored
possiblity is that this second highly conserved region
plays a role in packaging. However, based on the particular features of the sequence in this region, and on relevant
previously published data, we hypothesize an alternative
role.
Many viruses harbour sequences that induce a portion of
ribosomes to shift -1 nt and continue translating in the
new reading frame [7]. The -1 frameshift site typically consists of a 'slippery' heptanucleotide fitting the consensus
motif N NNW WWH, where NNN are any three identical
nucleotides, WWW represents AAA or UUU, H represents
A, C or U, and spaces separate zero-frame codons. This is
followed by a 'spacer' region of 5–9 nt, and then a stable
RNA secondary structure such as a pseudoknot or hairpin.
Inspection of the conserved sequence at the 5' end of the
NS2A CDS in the JEV group revealed the potential to form
a GC-rich stable pseudoknot structure (Figure 2) in the
region precisely corresponding to the peak in synonymous site conservation (Figure 1B). The predicted pseudoknot is well-supported by a number of compensatory
mutations, including three separate instances of an A:U
pair being replaced by a G:C pair. Furthermore, where
stem 1 is destabilized in one sequence by a G:A mispairing, stem 2 is lengthened by an extra base-pairing. Positioned 5' of the pseudoknot, and separated from it by a 5
nt spacer, is a conserved Y CCU UUU heptanucleotide,
where Y represents C or U, and spaces separate polyprotein-frame codons. Allowing for G:U anticodon:codon
repairing at position 1 of the heptanucleotide (when Y =
U), the combination of the Y CCU UUU heptanucleotide

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/14

and the 3' pseudoknot fit the consensus motif for -1
frameshifting.
The -1 frame ORF (termed foo, for "Flavivirus Overlapping
ORF") comprises 45 codons. Such short out-of-frame
ORFs are not well-represented amongst known cases of
programmed ribosomal frameshifting, but this may be
more a consequence of the difficulty in finding such cases
rather than any inherent rarity. Indeed we recently demonstrated the occurrence of -1 frameshifting, at a level of
10–18%, into a short ORF overlapping the 6K CDS in the
Alphavirus genus [8].
The combination of slippery heptanucleotide, 3' pseudoknot, and 45-codon -1 frame ORF is conserved in all five
RefSeqs (listed in the caption to Figure 2), and essentially
all their GenBank 'genome neighbours' [9] as of December 2008 (223 sequences). The only exceptions are seven
sequences – four with single mispairings in stem 1 of the
pseudoknot, one with a shortened stem 2, and two with a
truncated -1 frame ORF. At least three of the seven are
annotated as attenuated.
The putative shift site is located at codons 8–9 of the NS2A
CDS. Thus frameshifting would result in a 52 amino acid
NS2AN-FOO fusion peptide (where NS2AN represents the
N-terminal nine amino acids of NS2A). Previous work has
demonstrated that, at least in Dengue virus, cleavage at
the non-standard NS1-NS2A cleavage site requires translation of substantial (Ŭ 9 amino acids) parts of NS2A [1012]. Thus NS2AN-FOO is likely not cleaved from NS1, i.e.
the predicted mature transframe protein is NS1-NS2ANFOO.
On protein gels, NS1 typically migrates as a cluster of
bands, partly due to differing degrees of glycoslyation
which can add ~6 kDa to the NS1 mass [13-15]. NS1 also
forms multiple disulfide bonds and migrates with a substantially lower apparent molecular mass under nonreducing conditions [16]. In JEV, MVEV and WNV, however, the existance of an elongated form of NS1, termed
NS1', has been demonstrated [13-15,17-19]. NS1' is Nterminally coincident with NS1 [15] but extends into
NS2A, as demonstrated by the presence of an epitope not
present in NS1 but present in polyprotein sequence overlapping the carboxy terminus of NS1 [15,17,18], and by
the necessity of NS2A coding sequence for NS1' expression [15]. Thus, NS1' has been proposed to result from
cleavage at an alternative site within NS2A. However, sites
proposed by ref. [20] are too far downstream to account
for NS1' [15], and attempts to localize the cleavage site by
determining the carboxy terminal sequence of NS1' have
been unsuccessful [15]. Pulse-chase experiments have
demonstrated that NS1' is not simply a precursor of NS1
but is, instead, a stable end product [13,15].

Figure 1 (see at synonymous sites in Japanese encephalitis and related viruses
Conservation previous page)
Conservation at synonymous sites in Japanese encephalitis and related viruses. Conservation at synonymous sites
was calculated for an input alignment comprising the polyprotein CDSs from the seven JEV-group sequences listed in the caption to Figure 2. (A) Panels 1–3 show the positions of stop codons (blue triangles) in the three forward reading frames. The +0
frame is the polyprotein frame and is therefore devoid of stop codons. Alignment gaps are indicated in green. Panel 4 shows
the difference between the expected number (assuming neutral evolution) and observed number of base substitutions at synonymous sites, summed over a phylogenetic tree, and averaged over a 25-codon sliding window. Panel 5 shows the estimated
standard deviation for the statistic in panel 4 – major dips tend to correspond to alignment gaps (fewer pairwise sequence
comparisons to sum over), while the rise at each end of the alignment corresponds to the shorter terminal windows over
which statistics are averaged. Panel 6 is an approximation of the p-value corresponding to the statistic in panel 4, albeit subject
to the assumption of normal distribution. Panel 7 shows a map of the JEV genome, indicating the position of the putative -1
ribosomal frameshift site, and the putative transframe protein which may equate to NS1'. (B) Zoom-in of the region corresponding to the conservation peak in the NS2A CDS with a 15-codon sliding window. Note the highest level of conservation
corresponds precisely to the region covered by the predicted pseudoknot.

We hypothesize that, in JEV-group viruses, NS1' may in
fact correspond to NS1-NS2AN-FOO. This putative product contains sufficient NS2A sequence to potentially provide the polyprotein-derived epitope not in NS1.
Furthermore, although early estimates of the mass difference between NS1 and NS1' are inconsistent with the
hypothesis (e.g. unglycosylated masses of 42 kDa and 52
kDa, respectively, in JEV [13]), more recent estimates put
the mass difference in a plausible range (7–8 kDa) for the
mass of NS2AN-FOO (5.3–5.7 kDa), especially if it is posttranslationally modified, or migrating more slowly than
expected due to its high proline content (4–6 prolines;
Figure 3).
For example, working with JEV, ref. [14] estimated masses
for glycosylated NS1 and NS1' of 48 kDa and 55 kDa,
respectively, while for unglycosylated NS1 and NS1' the
masses were 42 kDa and 49 kDa. Thus, for JEV, the mass
of the C-terminal extension in NS1' is ~7 kDa. Similarly,
working with MVEV, ref. [15] estimated masses of 45 kDa
and 53 kDa for glycosylated NS1 and NS1', and 39 kDa
and 47 kDa for unglycosylated NS1 and NS1'. Thus, for
MVEV, the mass of the C-terminal extension in NS1' is ~8
kDa. Similar results were obtained by ref. [18].
Consistent with our hypothesis, when ref. [21] expressed
what they supposed to be an approximatation of JEV NS1'
from a plasmid containing NS1 and the first 60 amino
acids of NS2A (hereafter NS1-NS2A1..60), they appeared to
obtain an NS1' doublet – consistent with a mixture of the
zero-frame (NS1-NS2A1..60) and the predicted transframe
(NS1-NS2AN-FOO) products. No such doublet was
observed in controls comprising lysates from JEV-infected
cells. Assuming the product that comigrates with wildtype NS1' is NS1-NS2AN-FOO, then the other product corresponds to a fainter, more rapidly migrating band. This is
plausible if the high proline content of FOO causes it to
migrate more slowly and if the artificial product NS1NS2A1..60 is more rapidly degraded. The data do not fit a

cleavage hypothesis (as then the uncleaved NS1-NS2A1..60
would be expected to migrate more slowly than wild-type
NS1') and an impaired glycosylation explanation seems
unlikely (since the doublet appears to be present even in
a sample treated with endoglycosidase F). No NS1 was
produced from the NS1-NS2A1..60 plasmid (consistent
with NS1-NS2A cleavage requiring synthesis of NS2A; see
above) and no NS1' was produced from a plasmid just
expressing NS1 (consistent with NS1' requiring the 5' end
of the NS2A CDS).
A corresponding frameshift stimulatory motif was not
found in SLEV – the most divergent of the six JEV-group
RefSeqs but, interestingly, there was a long (89–165
codons) -1 frame ORF overlapping the boundary between
NS1 and NS2A, so it is possible that frameshifting also
occurs in SLEV at a non-canonical site, possibly further 5'
such as within the NS1 CDS. No evidence for frameshifting was found in Dengue or Kokobera viruses – consistent
with the apparent absence of NS1' in these species [19]. In
contrast to JEV-group NS1', the elongated NS1 product
(NS1-2A*; [22]) seen in Yellow fever virus apparently
results from cleavage much closer to the carboxy terminus
of NS2A [22,23] and, in any case, NS1-2A* appears to be
simply a precursor of mature NS1 rather than a stable end
product in itself, as demonstrated by pulse-chase analyses
[22].
