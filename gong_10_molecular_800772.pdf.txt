fatty acid-binding protein (Es-FABP) gene in
female Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis)

Abstract
Background: Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs), small cytosolic proteins that function in the uptake and
utilization of fatty acids, have been extensively studied in higher vertebrates while invertebrates have received little
attention despite similar nutritional requirements during periods of reproductive activity.
Results: Therefore, a cDNA encoding Eriocheir sinensis FABP (Es-FABP) was cloned based upon EST analysis of a
hepatopancreas cDNA library. The full length cDNA was 750 bp and encoded a 131 aa polypeptide that was highly
homologous to related genes reported in shrimp. The 9108 bp Es-FABP gene contained four exons that were
interrupted by three introns, a genomic organization common among FABP multigene family members in
vertebrates. Gene expression analysis, as determined by RT-PCR, revealed the presence of Es-FABP transcripts in
hepatopancreas, hemocytes, ovary, gills, muscle, thoracic ganglia, heart, and intestine, but not stomach or eyestalk.
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that Es-FABP expression in ovary, hemocytes, and hepatopancreas
was dependent on the status of ovarian development, with peak expression observed in January.
Conclusions: Evidence provided in the present report supports a role of Es-FABP in lipid transport during the
period of rapid ovarian growth in E. sinensis, and indirectly confirms the participation of the hepatopancreas, ovary,
and hemocytes in lipid nutrient absorption and utilization processes.

Background
Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are small (14-15 k
Da) cytosolic proteins that bind non-covalently to
hydrophobic ligands, primarily fatty acids [1]. Physiological roles of FABP include, but are not limited to, the
uptake and utilization of fatty acids, intracellular targeting of fatty acids to specific organelles and metabolic
pathways, and the protection of cellular structures from
the detergent effects of fatty acids [2-4]. Similarity
among FABP deduced amino acid sequences in vertebrates and invertebrates are generally low despite the
highly conserved gene structure of four exons and three
introns of variable size [5,6], with the exception of
desert locust FABP3 [7] and zebrafish FAPB1a [8]. Tertiary structure is common among all FABP family members, and consists of ten antiparallel b-sheet strands that
surround the ligand binding domain [9].

To date, 12 FABP isoforms have been identified in
vertebrates [10]. While genes were originally named
according to the initial tissue from which they were first
isolated, e.g. Liver-type FABP (L-FABP), Intestinal-type
FABP (I-FABP), Heart-type FABP (H-FABP), Adipocytetype FABP (A-FABP), Epidermal-type (E-FABP), isoform
expression among multiple tissues and differences in tissue distribution among FABP orthologs have resulted in
the implementation of numeric nomenclature, such that
FABP1 corresponds to L-FABP, FABP2 to I-FABP,
FABP3 to H-FABP, FABP4 to A-FABP, and FABP5 to
E-FABP [9,11].
FABPs bind a single ligand molecule [12], with the
exception of FABP1 and FABP10, both L-FABPs capable
of simultaneously binding two ligand molecules [13].
FABP1 was the first FABP isolated from liver [14], and
functions in fatty acid uptake [15] and metabolic pathway allocation in vertebrates [16], lipoprotein production [17], and nuclear delivery of peroxisome
proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) ligands that

results in the modulation of targeted gene expression
[18]. FABP10 was first isolated from chicken liver [13],
and is more similar in sequence to ileal FABPs than
mammalian FABP1. To date, the FABP10 gene and protein have only been identified in nonmammalian vertebrates [8].
While FABPs among vertebrates have been studied in
detail for more than three decades, with more than 400
identified, only ≈40 FABPs have yet been identified in
invertebrates [1,9] and no information concerning FABP
is available for Brachyura. The Chinese mitten crab
(Eriocheir sinensis), a commercially important species in
South-East Asia, is widely farmed in China and has
quickly become an important aquaculture species [19]
that has been cultured in ponds, reservoirs and lakes
since the 1990′s [20]. Hepatopancreas is generally
regarded as a major lipid storage organ analogous to the
fat body in insects and adipose tissue and liver in vertebrates [21]. The hepatopancreas in crab is a midgut
diverticulum involved in the synthesis and secretion of
digestive enzymes, final food digestion, nutrient absorption, and lipid and carbohydrate metabolism [22];
further, it is also a sensitive indicator of lipid metabolism and nutritional status [23]. Previous studies have
shown that energy stored in crab hepatopancreas is in
preparation for the significant expenditure required during the early stages of reproduction [24]. In order to
elucidate potential functions of the hepatopancreas during reproduction in E. sinensis, a nonnormalized hepatopancreatic cDNA library was constructed [25]. EST
analysis and subsequent cloning revealed an Es-FABP
unigene, the first FABP gene identified in Brachyura. In
the present study, we isolated FABP, for the first time
from hepatopancreas of the Chinese mitten crab, investigated seasonal expression with respect to reproductive
stage, and explored the relationship between FABP
expression level and ovary development in the Chinese
mitten crab in order to provide further insights into
reproduction, nutrition and development of the Chinese
mitten crab for farming industry.

Methods
Tissues preparation

Healthy adult female crabs (E. sinensis) were purchased
from Tongchuan aquatic product market, Shanghai,
China. Crabs were placed in an ice-bath for 1-2 min
until lightly anesthetized. Eleven tissues were collected,
including hepatopancreas, gills, stomach, intestine, cranial ganglia, thoracic ganglia, hemocyte, heart, muscle,
and ovary, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and
stored at -80°C until nucleic acid extraction.
Based on the ovarian classification of Xue et al [26],
ovarian Stage III-1 (40-50 mm diameter), III-2 (60-90
mm diameter), and IV (92-100 mm diameter) specimens

were collected from August to September, September to
November, and December to March, respectively, for
ovarian Es-FABP expression analysis. For the present
study, ovarian stages were further sub-divided based
upon the month of dissection: Stage III-1 (Aug), Stage
III-1 (Sep); Stage III-2 (Sep), Stage III-2 (Oct), Stage III2 (Nov); Stage IV (Jan). Collection of hepatopancreas
and hemocyte specimens occurred concomitantly with
ovarian staged specimens. Tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until RNA
extraction.
Nucleic acid extraction

RNA was extracted using a RNA Extraction Kit (Axygen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
RNA concentration and quality were estimated by spectrophotometry at an absorbance of 260 nm, (Eppendorf
Biophotometer plus, Germany) and agarose gel electrophoresis (Bio-Rad PowerPacBasic, USA), respectively.
Total RNA (200 ng) was reverse transcribed using the
PrimeScript™ RT-PCR Kit (TaKaRa, Japan) for semiquantitative RT-PCR or the SYBR PrimeScript™ RT-PCR
Kit (TaKaRa, Japan) for real-time quantitative RT-PCR
(qRT-PCR).
Chinese mitten crab genomic DNA was extracted
from hepatopancreas using the Axyprep™ Multisource
Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit (Axygen, USA) according
to manufacturer’s protocol. DNA concentration and
quality was estimated by spectrophotometry at an absorbance of 260 nm (Eppendorf Biophotometer plus, Germany) and agarose gel electrophoresis (Bio-Rad
PowerPacBasic, USA), respectively.
EST analysis and full-length cDNA cloning

A cDNA library was previously constructed from the
hepatopancreas of Chinese mitten crab, and 3355 successful sequencing reactions were obtained using a T3
primer [25]. BLASTx analysis of EST sequences revealed
20 ESTs with high identity to FcFABP in Fenneropenaeus chinensis (ACU82845), which could be assembled
into a single contig [a representative 527 bp EST is
reported as GenBank: FG358115]. Sequence of the
assembled Es-FABP contig was confirmed from the 3′
direction using a T7 primer (Table 1).
To verify cDNA sequence, a gene-specific primer pair,
F-S2 (sense) and F-R2 (anti-sense) (Table 1), was
designed by Primer Premier 5.0 based on the sequence
of the assembled contig mentioned above. The PCR
reaction was performed in a ABI 2720 Thermal Cycler
in a total volume of 25 μl and contained 2.5 μl of 10 ×
PCR buffer (Mg2+ plus), 2.0 μl of dNTPs mix (2.5 mM
each), 0.5 μl of each primer (20 μM), 18.375 μl of
RNase-free water, 0.125 μl (5 U/μl) of Taq polymerase
(TaKaRa, Japan), and 1 μl cDNA (500 ng/μl) as

bp was generated using the gene-specific primer pair FR2 and F-S2 (Table 1). The constitutively expressed betaactin (Actin-R and Actin-S) produced a 276 bp product
and served as an internal control. FABP and beta-actin
genes were run in two single PCR reaction, with same
PCR conditions and cycle number. The PCR reaction was
performed in a final volume of 25 μl and contained 2.5 μl
10 × PCR buffer (Mg2+ Plus), 2 μl 10 mM dNTP mixture,
0.25 μl 20 mM each primer, 18.875 μl PCR-Grade water,
0.125 μl 5 U Ex Taq™ Hot Start Version (TaKaRa, Japan),
and 1 μl cDNA as template. PCR conditions were as follows: 94°C for 5 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55°C for
30 s, 72°C for 1 min; and 72°C for 5 min. RT-PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium
bromide and detected under a Gel Doc 2000 ultraviolet
light (Tannon, China).

template. The PCR conditions were as follows: 94°C for
5 min; 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s, 72°C for
30 s; and 72°C for 10 min. Appropriately sized PCR products were gel-purified and ligated into a pGEM-T easy
vector (Promega, USA) with T4 DNA ligase. Positive
clones containing inserts of predicted size were
sequenced using T7 and SP6 primers (Table 1).
Cloning of the Es-FABP gene and associated 5′, 3′flanking regions

The Es-FABP genomic DNA sequence was obtained
with a gene-specific primer pair (F-S1, F-R1; Table 1),
which corresponded to the cloned cDNA sequence. The
final PCR reaction was performed in a total volume of
25 μl as described above. The 5′and 3′-flanking regions
were cloned using a Genome Walking Kit (TaKaRa,
Japan) according to the manufacturer′s protocol with
the following primers: 5′SP1, 5′SP2, 5′SP3, 3′SP1, 3′SP2,
and 3′SP3. Specific products were purified and ligated
into a pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, USA) with T4
DNA ligase. Positive clones were sequenced using SP6
primers (Table 1) and a 3730XL DNA analyzer (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The positions of exons
and introns were determined by spidey. http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Ostell/Spidey/
Phylogenetic analysis

Es-FABP nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences
were compared to those reported for other organisms
using the BLAST algorithm at the National Center for
Biotechnology Information http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
to assess sequence identity. FABP amino acid sequences
from E. sinensis and representative taxa were retrieved
from NCBI GenBank and analyzed using the ClustalW
Multiple Alignment program http://www.ebi.ac.uk/

SYBR Green real-time qRT-PCR analysis

Real-time qRT-PCR was performed in a C1000™ Thermal Cycler (BioRad CFX 96™ Real-Time System) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR conditions
were as follows: 95°C for 30 s; 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s,
60°C for 30 s, with an 0.1°C/s incremental increase from
60°C to 95°C. The final volume of each qRT-PCR reaction was 25.0 μl, and contained 12.5 μl 2 × SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa, Japan), 0.5 μl diluted cDNA
template, 11.0 μl PCR-Grade water, and 0.5 μl of each
20 uM primer (F-R3, F-S3 Table 1). Beta-actin fragments were amplified using the primer pair Actin-R and
Actin-S, and served as a positive control. Samples were
run in triplicate, and Es-FABP expression levels were
calculated by the 2-ΔΔCt comparative CT method [27].
Data are represented as triplicate mean ± SD (standard
deviation) and presented as the n-fold difference relative
to beta-actin.
Statistical analysis

Statistical significance was determined by a one-way
ANOVA and a posthoc Tukey test using SPSS 11.5 software. Significance was set at P <0.05.

Results
Cloning and identification of the Es-FABP cDNA

A full length FABP cDNA (Es-FABP) was isolated from the
hepatopancreas of a female Chinese mitten crab [GenBank:
GU568242]. The full length cDNA (750 bp) contained a
393 bp open reading frame (ORF), which encoded a putative 131 amino acid FABP protein, a 65 bp 5′-untranslated
region (UTR), and a 282 bp 3′-UTR (Fig. 1). A single polyadenylation signal (AATAA) was observed 719 bp upstream
of the 12 bp poly (A) tail. Analysis of the Es-FABP cDNA

Homology Analysis of Es-FABP

The identity of Es-FABP and other representative vertebrate and invertebrate deduced amino acid FABP
sequences was explored via multiple sequence alignment
using ClustalX (Fig. 4) [28]. Overall percent identify was
high among Es-FABP and other reported invertebrate
sequences, with 56% identity to Fenneropenaeus chinensis and 62% identity to Litopenaeus vannamei. Overall
percent identity of Es-FABP and representative higher
and lower vertebrates was substantially lower, with 21%
identity to Ctenopharyngodon idella; 22% identity to
Sparus aurata; 27% identity to Xenopus tropicalis; 28%
identity to Rattus norvegicus; 29% identity to Homo
sapiens, Mus musculus, Danio rerio, Taeniopygia guttata, Rana catesbeiana, Pongo abelii; 30% identity to Bos
Taurus; 32% identity to Gallus gallus.
A NJ phylogenic tree was constructed based on
reported FABPs amino acid sequences using MEGA4.0
software (Fig. 5). The reliability of the branching was
tested using the bootstrap resampling (with 1000 pseudo

replicates) technique. Two distinct sister groups were
observed, with tree topology in agreement with traditional taxonomic relationships. The first group contained vertebrate FABP1, FABP6 and FABP10
sequences, as well as Es-FABP and shrimp FABPs. The
second group contained vertebrate FABP2, FABP3,
FABP4, FABP5, FABP7, FABP8, FABP9, FABP11, and
FABP12 sequences.
A homology model of Es-FABP was predicted in
SWISS-MODEL database http://swissmodel.expasy.org/
revealed conservation of tertiary structure, with the 10
anti-parallel b-strands forming a barrel and a clamshelllike structure.
Tissue distribution and reproductive dependence of EsFABP expression

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and real-time qRT-PCR were
employed to investigate the distribution of Es-FABP
mRNA in different tissues as well as to assess expression
during the seasonal female reproductive cycle. As

determined by RT-PCR, Es-FABP was widely distributed
with high and detectable expression levels observed in
hepatopancreas, ovary, hemocytes, and gills, muscle, cranial ganglia, thoracic ganglia, heart, intestine, respectively; while expression was nondetectable in stomach
and eyestalk (Fig. 6).
As determined by real-time qRT-PCR, beta-actin normalized Es-FABP expression in ovary increased rapidly
and significantly from Stage III-1 (Aug-Sep) to reach
peak expression during Stage III-2 (Nov) (Fig. 7). EsFABP ovarian expression then decreased significantly
through Stage IV (Jan). Hepatopancreatic expression
decreased gradually from Stage III-1 (Aug) to Stage III-2
(Nov) and then increased significantly in Stage IV (Jan)
(Fig. 8). Es-FABP expression in hemocytes did not differ
significantly from Stage III-1 (Aug) through Stage III-2
(Nov), with a sharp peak observed during Stage IV (Jan)
(Fig. 9).

Discussion
FABP gene family members are evolutionarily conserved, with extensive and interdependent functions in

the regulation of fatty acid oxidation/metabolism [9].
Although much research has focused on the classification, structure and function of vertebrate FABPs, these
proteins remain unidentified in many invertebrate species. The current study reports the cloning and gene
structure of a FABP family member in E. sinensis, EsFABP, and presents evidence of functionality in fatty
acid metabolism.
The full-length Es-FABP cDNA reported in the present paper encoded a putative FABP protein of 131
amino acids, which falls within the size range of other
reported FABPs (127-136 amino acids) [29]. The ClustalX alignment of Es-FABP and fourteen other reported
vertebrate and invertebrate FABP sequences revealed
high identity among invertebrate sequences (56-62%)
although percent identity remained lower when comparing within invertebrate and mammalian taxa (79-90%)
[9]. Three-dimensional homology modeling revealed
that several key tertiary structures of Es-FABP were
similar to those of vertebrate FABP, such as the 10 antiparallel b-strands, their resultant barrel with a clamshell-like structure, and the barrel cap comprised of a

pair of a-helices, which enclose the FABP lipid-binding
site cavity [30].
The cloned Es-FABP gene was 9108 bp in length, and
was comprised of four exons interrupted by three
introns, a conserved genomic organization among both
species [31,32] and FABP superfamily members. Comparison of the exon/intron organization of the FABP
genes revealed that, the genes are organized in four
exons and three introns located in conserved positions,
although varying markedly in size. And the second
intron of Es-FABP was substantially longer than
reported for other species. In general, while large
introns are not unusual in organisms with very large
genomes, they are less common among heavily transcribed genes, like the locust FABP [7]. Long introns
might be favored because they enhance recombination,
thus introducing mutations in adjacent exons [33] or

period of reproductive activity, as determined by real-time
qRT-PCR. Es-FABP expression, normalized to beta-actin, was
quantified in mitten crab ovaries collected during the stages of
rapid ovarian maturation: Stage III-1(Aug), Stage III-1(Sep), Stage III-2
(Sep), Stage III-2 (Oct), Stage III-2 (Nov), and Stage IV (Jan). Bars
represent the triplicate mean ± S.E. from three individuals (n = 3).

intra- and inter- gene recombination [34], all of which
would be subjected to selection pressures.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed two distinct sister
groups within our constructed NJ tree as previously
reported [8,35]: (1) group 1 contained FABP1, 6, 10, and
(2) group 2 contained FABP2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12.
Schaap et. al. estimated that FABP1, FABP6 and
FABP10 diverged from a common ancestral gene ~679
million years ago (mya) [6]. FABP6 is an ileal-type FABP
[36], while FABP1 and FABP10 are paralogs, and are
thus evolutionarily related liver-type FABPs, which possibly arose by a gene duplication event [8]. Es-FABP segregated within group 1, clustering in close proximity to
Fc-FABP10 and LvFABP10. ClustalX alignment results
suggest that Es-FABP shares a high percent identity
with FABP10. Based on collective phylogenetic evidence,
we hypothesize that the Es-FABP we cloned from hepatopancreas is a FABP10.
We hypothesized that Es-FABP tissue expression profiles may provide useful cues when speculating gene
function. In the present study, Es-FABP transcripts were
primarily detected in hepatopancreas, hemocytes, and
ovary. The hepatopancreas is generally regarded as a
major storage organ of lipids, which are transported to
reproductive organs and tissues during a period of
reproductive activity [24]. Interestingly, the crustacean
ovary contains a high lipid content compared to other
organs [37,38], which is a key nutrient required for
ovarian development and appropriate egg hatching rate
and larval survival [38-41]. Further, the crustacean ovary
is rich in long-chain poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)
[42]. As intracellular transporters of PUFA, FABP may
serve as mediators of their physiological function, availability and access to intracellular targeted systems [10].

Figure 9 Hemocytes Es-FABP expression was influenced by the period of reproductive activity, as determined by real-time qRT-PCR.
Es-FABP expression, normalized to beta-actin, was quantified in mitten crab ovaries collected during the stages of rapid ovarian maturation:
Stage III-1(Aug), Stage III-1(Sep), Stage III-2 (Sep), Stage III-2 (Oct), Stage III-2 (Nov), and Stage IV (Jan). Bars represent the triplicate mean ± S.E.
from three individuals (n = 3). Bars with different letters differed significantly (P < 0.05).

The high Es-FABP expression levels observed in these
organs suggest that lipid nutrients, especially fatty acids,
are transported from the hepatopancreas to the ovary in
great supply via Es-FABP expressing hemocytes during
the stage of rapid ovarian development. Es-FABP transported lipids are then stored in the ovaries in preparation for the significant and impendent energy
expenditure required during reproduction [21].
Real-time qRT-PCR analysis revealed Es-FABP expression levels were dependent on the stage of ovarian
development in all three organs. Fatty acids (FA) in general, including the ubiquitous palmitic and oleic acids,
can regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level
[43,44]. Furthermore, long-chain FA and long-chain
dicarboxylic acids can act as inducers of FABP1 expression [45,46], as tissue FABP content is related to the
rate of FA uptake and/or utilization [47-49]. Similarly,
manipulations altering the rate of tissue FA metabolism
appear to be associated with concomitant changes in
FABP content [50]. Therefore, a direct or indirect feedback loop between FA and FABP may exist. In the present study, ovarian Es-FABP expression increased with
the developmental progression of the ovary, mirroring
lipid nutritional requirements. The ovary requires substantial accumulation of lipids, especially fatty acids,
during developmental stages [51-53]. Interestingly, the

rapid increase in ovarian lipid deposition was associated
with a gradual decline in Es-FABP expression in hepatopancreas, suggesting hepatopancreas-mediated lipid
transport may be occurring during ovarian development.
Determining the existence or absence of a hepatopancreas-ovary feedback loop requires further study.

Conclusions
In conclusion, evidence provided in the present report
supports a role of Es-FABP in lipid transport during the
period of rapid ovarian growth in E. sinensis, and indirectly confirms the participation of the hepatopancreas,
ovary, and hemocytes in lipid nutrient absorption and
utilization processes. However, further study concerning
Es-FABP’s specific mechanistic role in the process of
lipid transport is both required and warranted.
