Abstract
Background: The Influenza A pandemic sustained by a new H1N1 variant (H1N1v) started in Mexico and the USA
at the end of April 2009 spreading worldwide in a few weeks. In this study we investigate the variability of the NS1
gene of the pandemic H1N1v strain with respect to previous seasonal strains circulating in humans and the
potential selection of virus variants through isolation in cell culture.
Methods: During the period April 27th 2009-Jan 15th 2010, 1633 potential 2009 H1N1v cases have been screened
at our center using the CDC detection and typing realtime RT-PCR assays. Virus isolation on MDCK cells was
systematically performed in 1/10 positive cases. A subset of 51 H1N1v strains isolated in the period May-September
2009 was selected for NS1 gene sequencing. In addition, 15 H1N1 and 47 H3N2 virus isolates from three previous
seasonal epidemics (2006-2009) were analyzed in parallel.
Results: A low variability in the NS1 amino acid (aa) sequence among H1N1v isolates was shown (aa identity
99.5%). A slightly higher NS1 variability was observed among H1N1 and H3N2 strains from previous epidemics (aa
identity 98.6% and 98.9%, respectively). The H1N1v strains were closely related (aa identity 92.1%) to swine
reference strain (A/swine/Oklahoma/042169/2008). In contrast, substantial divergence (aa identity 83.4%) with
respect to human reference strain A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 and previous epidemic strains H1N1 and H3N2 (aa
identity 78.9% and 77.6%, respectively) was shown. Specific sequence signatures of uncertain significance in the
new virus variant were a C-terminus deletion and a T215P substitution.
Conclusions: The H1N1v NS1 gene was more conserved than that of previous epidemic strains. In addition, a
closer genetic identity of H1N1v with the swine than the human reference strains was shown. Hot-spots were
shown in the H1N1v NS1 aa sequence whose biologic relevance remains to be investigated.

Background
The 8 th segment of the influenza A virus genome
encodes for two non structural proteins (NS1 and NS2)
which were involved in virus immune evasion mechanisms. In particular, NS1 impairs the innate host immune
response mediated by interferons (IFN) a and g [1] and
hampers the adaptive immune response by inhibiting

the expression of TNF-a and IL-6 [2,3]. In addition,
NS1 contributes significantly to the efficiency of virus
replication through temporal regulation of virus mRNAs
synthesis, control of the splicing process of the same
mRNAs and the correct maturation and morphogenesis
of virus particles [4]. Finally, the carboxy-terminal PDZligand (PL) domain endows NS1 with the ability to play
an important role in the compartimentalization of viral
protein in the nuclei of infected cells [5,6].

(HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes have occurred,
with a major morbidity and mortality burden. In particular, the 1918 pandemic (Spanish Influenza) was sustained by a H1N1 strain, the 1957 pandemic (Asian
Influenza) was caused by a H2N2 strain and the 1968
pandemic (Hong Kong Influenza) was triggered by the
appearance of a reassorted H3N2 strain [7]. By contrast,
the first pandemic of the new millenium was sustained
by an Influenza A variant (H1N1v) with a complex
genetic origin. The H1N1 swine lineage was established
following introduction of the 1918/H1N1 avian virus in
pigs. The novel H1N1v virus is a descendant of this original lineage, formed as a multiple reassortant of swine
influenza viruses circulating in pigs in North America
and Eurasia. Phylogenetic analysis was consistent with
the hypothesis that this new virus circulated in pigs for
at least a decade, before surfacing in the human population for the first time in Mexico, in January 2009 [8].
Although the H1N1v pandemic strain did not show significant morbidity and mortality, it rapidly spread worldwide. Another Influenza A virus raising major concern
is the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 strain. This virus,
first isolated in the Guangdong province of China in
1996, caused a small outbreak in humans in Hong Kong
in 1997 [9], and is responsible for an ongoing pandemic
in the avian population and occasional infections in
humans (about 300 cases worldwide). While the H5N1
virus is not capable of human-to-human transmission
and is only directly acquired from infected birds, its
mortality in humans is very high (>60%) [10].
A number of studies on the pathogenicity mechanisms
of the highly aggressive human A/1918/H1N1 and avian
A/1997/H5N1 strains, revealed the important role of
NS1 in mediating viral pathogenicity. Reverse genetics
experiments showed that the NS1 protein of both
viruses might be responsible for a lower susceptibility to
the antiviral activity of IFN- and TNF-mediated
responses [11-13]. NS1 is an highly conserved multifunctional protein, and its potential role in influenza
virus pathogenicity has recently become evident. NS1
sequences can be grouped in two major alleles (A and
B) [14,15]. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all
human, swine and equine influenza A viruses and a
large number of highly pathogenic avian isolates all
share the same NS1 allele (allele A) with similarity levels
between 93% and 100% while allele B is present in the
avian population only, suggesting a role in mammalian
adaptation [4,16].
The present work was aimed at verifying: i) the variability of the NS1 gene of the pandemic H1N1v strain
with respect to previous seasonal strains circulating in
humans and ii) the potential selection of virus variants
through isolation in cell culture.

Materials and methods
Specimens

As part of the National Influenza Surveillance Network
(Influnet) and one of the two Lombardy Region virology
reference centers, the Molecular Virology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, received nasal
swabs from the entire Lombardia Region (total population, about 10 million) for diagnosis and surveillance of
the 2009 influenza A pandemic. Following national
guidelines, in the period April-August, patients traveling
from countries with widespread H1N1v infection and
influenza-like illness (ILI) were individually screened.
Following the pandemic declaration by WHO on June
11th, 2009, only patients with ILI admitted to the Policlinico San Matteo and other Hospitals in Lombardy were
screened for influenza infection using the pan-influenzaA and the H1N1v-specific realtime RT-PCR assays
developed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
(1600 Clifton Rd. Atlanta, GA, 30333, USA). Briefly,
virus RNA was extracted from 200 μl nasal swab transport medium (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA, USA)
using the NucliSens® easyMAG® automatic extraction
(bioMérieux, Lyon, France) and eluted in 50 μl H 2 O.
Five μl of extracted RNA were submitted to realtime
RT-PCR using the Ag-Path-ID one-step RT-PCR kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), pan-Influenza A primers and probe targeting the highly conserved M gene, as well as primers and probe targeting a
sequence of influenza A HA gene specific for H1N1v
strain and the 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems).
In addition, one out of ten real-time RT-PCR positive
nasal swab samples were systematically inoculated onto
Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells.
Forty-seven influenza A H3N2 and 15 H1N1 isolates
recovered during the three preceeding seasonal epidemics were analyzed in parallel. Seasonal influenza A
strains were detected, typed and recovered from nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) and bronchoalveolar lavage
(BAL) samples from patients referred to the Policlinico
San Matteo Hospital during the 2006-2007, 2007-2008
and 2008-2009 winter-spring seasons as previously
reported [17-19].
NS1 amplification and sequencing

Influenza A NS1 was amplified with subtype-specific
primers using 5 μl of virus RNA extracted from 200 μl
nasal swab, NPA and BAL samples as well as cell culture supernatants. In detail, “in house” and sequencing
techniques were developed to obtain 822 bp amplicons
(nt-25 to nt 797) using a H1N1v-specific primer set
(forward, 5′-GCA AAA GCA GGG TGA CAA AAA C3′; reverse, 5′-CTT CAA GCA GTA GTT GTA AGG

C-3′), while H1N1- and H3N2-specific primer sets consisted of a common forward primer (5′-AGC AAA AGC
AGG GTG ACA AAG A-3′) and subtype-specific
reverse primers (H1N1, 5′-AAC GTT CTA ATC TCT
TGT TCC ACT TCA A-3′; H3N2, 5′-GAG AAA GTT
CTT ATC TCC TGT TCC ACT-3′) generating 845 (nt26 to nt 819) and 848 (nt-26 to nt 822) bp amplicons,
respectively. RT-PCR reactions were carried out using
the Ag-Path-ID one-step RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems) in a GeneAmp® PCR System 9700 thermal cycler
(Applied Biosystems) using the following thermal profiles: i) H1N1v, 1 cycle at 45°C for 15 min and 95°C for
10 min, followed by 50 cycles at 95°C for 60 sec, 60°C
for 50 sec and 72°C for 90 sec, with a final elongation of
7 min at 72°C; ii) H1N1 or H3N2, 1 cycle at 45°C for 15
min and 95°C for 10 min, followed by 50 cycles at 95°C
for 60 sec, 55°C for 50 sec and 72°C for 90 sec, with a
final elongation of 7 min at 72°C.
Sequencing of NS1 amplicons was performed with
internal primers (H1N1v-forward, 5′-AGC CCT TAG
TAG TAT CAA GGT C-3′; H1N1v-reverse, 5′-GCC
TAG GCA AAA GAT AAT AGG C-3′; H1N1-forward,5′-CTC TTT GTG TCA GAA TGG ACC-3′;
H1N1-reverse, 5′-AAT GTC AGA TTC TCC AAC
CGG-3′; H3N2-forward, 5′-TTC ATG CTA ATG CCC
AAG CAG-3′; H3N2-reverse, 5′-ACT ATG GTC TCT
AGT CGG TC-3′), utilizing the ABI PRISM™ Big Dye
Terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems) and the ABI
PRISM™ 3100 automatic sequencer (Applied
Biosystems).
NS1 sequence analysis

NS1 sequences were analyzed using the Sequencher 4.7
software (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI, USA).
Multiple sequence alignments were obtained using the
ClustalW 1.6 program and phylogenetic analysis was
performed using the MEGA 4.0 program [20]. A neighbor-joining tree was generated using a Maximum Composite Likelihood method for simultaneously estimating
evolutionary distances between all sequence pairs. Bootstrap analysis was performed using 1000 repetitions.
Nucleotide sequences were deposited in the GenBank
database [GenBank: HM745138-HM745250].
Intra- and Inter-strain analysis were performed by
comparing mean values of nucleotide and amino acid
identity between groups of sequences using the Student’s t-test, while the analysis of variance was performed using the Bonferroni post-test.

During the period April 27th 2009-Jan 15th 2010, 1633
nasal swab samples were received for diagnosis of influenza A infection and surveillance of the pandemic. Of

Page 3 of 8

the tested specimens, 514 (31.5%) were positive for
H1N1v. A total of 82 nasal swab samples (about one
out of every ten consecutive positive) was inoculated
onto MDCK cells, obtaining 53 virus isolates. Of these,
51 were submitted to NS1 sequence analysis.
NS1 sequence analysis

With respect to 47 H3N2 and 15 H1N1 strains from
previous epidemics, the H1N1v NS1 gene coding
sequence is 33 nucleotides shorter, corresponding to a
deletion of 11 amino acids at the C-terminus (690 nt
and 230 aa vs 657 nt and 219 aa, respectively) (Fig. 1).
The three groups of gene sequences resulted phylogenetically distinct from each other (Fig. 2). Among the
H3N2 strains, two NS1 sequence clusters were observed:
the first included six isolates from the 2006-2007 season
and the second 41 isolates from the 2006-2007, 20072008 and 2008-2009 seasons. Similarly, NS1 sequences
from seasonal H1N1 strains could be grouped in one
cluster including five strains from the 2006-2007 season,
one including nine strains from the subsequent season
and one sequence from the 2008-2009 season (Fig. 2).
No substantial genetic drift was observed in the group
of the H1N1v isolates collected during the study period
(Fig. 2).
The NS1 sequence from the pandemic H1N1v and
seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 strains were then compared
with a human and a swine reference sequence (Table 1).
The seasonal H1N1 strains showed higher similarity to
the human “Spanish” influenza A/Brevig/Mission/1/1918
reference strain (90.9%), than the H1N1v strains
(83.4%). In contrast, the pandemic H1N1v strains
showed greater similarity to the swine A/Swine/Oklahoma/042169/2008 reference strain (93.8%).
Intra-strain NS1 variability

Intra-strain analysis showed high level of nucleotide and
amino acid identity in each group of NS1 sequences
(Table 1), and the coefficient of variation (CV) for phylogenetic distances with respect to the mean value of
each group of sequences was always <3% (Table 2).
Inter-strain NS1 variability

Inter-strain analysis showed 87.7% nucleotide identity
between H1N1 and H3N2 strains, 78.8% nucleotide
identity between H1N1 and H1N1v strains, and 77.9%
nucleotide identity between H3N2 and H1N1v strains.
Inter-strain amino acid identities between H1N1 and
H3N2, H1N1 and H1N1v as well as H3N2 and H1N1v
were 84.0%, 78.9% and 77.6%, respectively. Thus, seasonal (H3N2 and H1N1) strains showed a greater nucleotide and amino acid identity between themselves than
with respect to the pandemic H1N1v strains (Table 1).
However, a statistically significant difference among

each of the three groups of sequences was observed (p <
0.001).
The inter-strain analysis performed on the three functional domains of NS1 (RNA-binding domain, codons
aa 1-73; effector domain, codons aa 74-207; disordered
tail, codons aa 208-219/230) showed a greater nucleotide identity in the effector domain with respect to the
RNA binding domain, while the lowest identity was
observed in the disordered tail (Table 3). When considering the amino acid identity in the three protein
domains, a different picture was observed. In fact, the
most conserved domain was the RNA binding domain
followed by the effector domain and the disordered tail,
respectively (Table 3). Interestingly, all nucleotide and
amino acid inter-strain differences (H1N1v vs H3N2,
H1N1v vs H1N1 and H1N1 vs H3N2) were statistically
significant (p < 0.001).
Distribution of NS1 amino acid polymorphisms

In Fig. 1, distribution of NS1 aa polymorphisms in the
three groups of virus strains is shown. H3N2 strains
showed the wider distribution of aa polymorphisms,
with 21 polymorphic codons (21/230, 9.1%) evenly
spread over the three functional domains. The H1N1

strains had 12/230 (5.2%) and H1N1v strains had 8/219
(3.7%) polymorphic codons concentrated mostly in the
effector domain, even though the effector domain
regions carrying polymorphic codons were different in
H1N1v vs H1N1 strains (Fig. 1). Among the H1N1v
polymorphic codons the V123I substitution was
observed in 3/51 (5.8%) strains respect to seasonal
H1N1 and H3N2 (15/15 and 47/47, respectively) and
N133D substitution was significantly more frequent (13/
51, 25.6%) than in seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 strains (0/
15 and 0/47, respectively). All gene sequences of
H1N1v, H1N1 and H3N2 isolates were identical to
those obtained with the corresponding clinical
specimens.

Discussion
NS1 is considered a highly conserved influenza A gene
[7]. However, the NS1 evolutionary change rate (as measured by nt substitutions per site per year) is similar to
that of the viral HA gene [21].
The 2009 influenza A pandemic will be remembered
as the pandemic that did not live up to expectations.
For example it was predicted that the pandemic virus
would emerge with a new HA or NA subtype and that

the emergence of the new virus would be responsible for
a severe clinical syndrome and increased mortality due
to the lack of pre-existing herd immunity against the
new virus subtype. Even though infection by H1N1v
virus showed mild clinical symptoms and low mortality,
the new virus efficiently spread worldwide despite the
presence of strong herd immunity against subtype
H1N1, consolidated after decades of seasonal epidemics
and vaccination campaigns.

The pandemic H1N1v influenza virus originated from
a reassortant Eurasian avian-like swine A/H1N1 virus
and a triple-reassortant virus circulating in North American swine [8]. As such, the H1N1v virus contains NA
and M genes from Eurasian avian-like swine A/H1N1
virus, and the remaining genes from the triple-reassortant virus - PB2 and PA (avian virus), PB1 (human A/
H3N2), and HA, NP and NS (classical swine A/H1N1).
The novel H1N1v virus is antigenically distant from the

prevailing human H1N1 virus, and there is little prior
cross-reacting humoral immunity in the population,
with the exception of those individuals older than
60 years [22].
A greater intra-strain variation was observed for seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 variants with respect to H1N1v.
However, the latter were collected over a shorter time
span.
A statistically significant difference between NS1
sequences of seasonal strains and NS1 of the pandemic
strain and each of the two seasonal strains was observed.
Thus, the pandemic H1N1v strain was endowed with a
highly divergent NS1 gene, with close genetic similarity
to the NS1 of the swine reference strain. In addition,
the distribution of polymorphic codons clearly differentiated NS1 of H3N2 strains from both H1N1v and
H1N1, but important differences were observed also
between the H1N1v and seasonal H1N1. Moreover, one
marked difference with previous seasonal human influenza strains was the deletion of a carboxy terminal portion of the protein. The observed differences between
H1N1v, H1N1 and H3N2 strains could not be attributed
to selective pressure on NS1 during culture in MDCK
cells since all gene sequences of H1N1v, H1N1 and
H3N2 isolates were identical to those obtained with the
corresponding clinical specimens.
Although truncated NS1 sequences have been
described in human strains [23], the significance of this
genetic alteration is still debated. Previous studies have
shown that alteration of the C-ter PL domain might be
associated with increased virulence in both mammalian
[24] and avian [25] strains. A human H1N1 strain with
a 7-amino acid extension in the NS1 protein emerged in
the ‘40s circulating until the ‘80s, when the reverted
genotype became prevalent [4]. This extension has been
proposed to “mask” the PL-domain, inhibiting its association with cellular PDZ proteins. In addition, Melen et
al. [5] have correlated this NS1 alteration with a different nuclear and nucleolar localization of the protein.
However, the impact of the 11 amino acid deletion in
the NS1 protein of the H1N1v on strain virulence, host
adaptation or replicative capacity remains to be further
defined.
Our analysis showed that the H1N1v NS1 proteins
had a lower number of inter-strain amino acid differences than the NS1 from seasonal H1N1 viruses. Of
these differences, six out of eight amino acid changes
occurred in the effector domain. In particular, position
123 represents the domain that interacts with the
dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR), an important
modulator of the innate immune response. An artificially induced V123A mutation was shown to reduce
this interaction, rendering the virus less efficient in inhibiting the PKR-activated response [26]. None of the

Page 7 of 8

other residues has been reported to play a role in protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions, suggesting
that they are polymorphisms with no clear functional
consequences. Overall, it appears that the H1N1v NS1
protein did not accumulate adaptation-specific mutations during the course of the epidemic, further reinforcing the notion that the original virus was already welladapted to mammalian hosts. Whether such a stable
and well-adapted virus might evolve into a more virulent strain during sustained circulation in the human
