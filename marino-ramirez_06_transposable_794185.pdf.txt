Abstract
Background: Transposable elements (TEs) are abundant genomic sequences that have been found
to contribute to genome evolution in unexpected ways. Here, we characterize the evolutionary
and functional characteristics of TE-derived human genome regulatory sequences uncovered by the
high throughput mapping of DNaseI-hypersensitive (HS) sites.
Results: Human genome TEs were found to contribute substantially to HS regulatory sequences
characterized in CD4+ T cells: 23% of HS sites contain TE-derived sequences. While HS sites are
far more evolutionarily conserved than non HS sites in the human genome, consistent with their
functional importance, TE-derived HS sites are highly divergent. Nevertheless, TE-derived HS sites
were shown to be functionally relevant in terms of driving gene expression in CD4+ T cells. Genes
involved in immune response are statistically over-represented among genes with TE-derived HS
sites. A number of genes with both TE-derived HS sites and immune tissue related expression
patterns were found to encode proteins involved in immune response such as T cell specific
receptor antigens and secreted cytokines as well as proteins with clinical relevance to HIV and
cancer. Genes with TE-derived HS sites have higher average levels of sequence and expression
divergence between human and mouse orthologs compared to genes with non TE-derived HS sites.
Conclusion: The results reported here support the notion that TEs provide a specific genomewide mechanism for generating functionally relevant gene regulatory divergence between
evolutionary lineages.

Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA sequences capable
of moving among chromosomal locations within the
genome. TEs are copious genomic entities; at least half of
the human genome sequence is derived from TE insertions [1,2]. While TEs were once thought to be purely selfish parasites concerned only with their own proliferation

[3], there are now numerous examples of TE sequences
that have been domesticated [4] to play some role for the
host genomes in which they reside [5]. One way that TEs
can achieve such a mutualistic status is through the donation of regulatory sequences that help control the expression of nearby host genes. For instance, recent genomewide studies have shown that TEs can be found in genespecific regulatory regions such as proximal promoters
and untranslated regions as well as regulatory sequences
that exert more global effects like scaffold/matrix attachment regions and locus control regions [6,7]. LINE elements, in particular, have been demonstrated to have
genome-wide effects in lowering expression when
inserted within transcribed regions [8]. Comparative
sequence analyses have shown that many sequences from
two particular human TE families have evolved under
purifying selection, strongly suggesting a functional role
related to gene regulation [9]. More specifically, numerous experimentally characterized cis-regulatory binding
sequences have been shown to be derived from TE insertions [6,10], and a number of anecdotal cases of gene regulatory phenotypes governed by TE sequences have been
confirmed [11,12]. At the same time, TEs are known to be
among the least evolutionarily conserved elements in the
human genome [1]. Indeed, TE activity and insertions
often lead to the most substantial evolutionary differences
between mammalian genome sequences [13,14]. Taken
together with their ability to donate regulatory sequences,
the lineage-specific nature of TEs suggests that they may
provide a specific mechanism for driving the regulatory
divergence between evolutionary lineages [10].
There are numerous experimental and computational
efforts underway aimed at characterizing the non-coding
portion of mammalian genomes [15]. Much of this work
is focused on elucidating the location and nature of regulatory sequences that control the expression of nearby
genes. An example of this kind of work is the large scale
attempt, spearheaded by the National Human Genome
Research Institute (NHGRI), to characterize a complete set
of human genome DNaseI-hypersensitive (HS) sites http:/
/research.nhgri.nih.gov/DNaseHS/May2005/. HS sites are
associated with gene regulatory regions, for upregulated
genes in particular, and mapping of HS sites is considered
to be among the most reliable experimental methods for
identifying regulatory sequences. HS sites have been
shown to be associated with a variety of regulatory regions
such as promoters, enhancers, suppressors, insulators,
and locus control regions [16].
Using recently developed high throughput experimental
methods, thousands of HS sites were cloned from human
CD4+ T cells [17,18] and sequenced using massively parallel signature sequencing [19]; results were confirmed
with real time PCR [20]. CD4+ T cells are a class of lym-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/20

phocytes known as helper or effector T cells that serve to
activate and direct other immune cells. CD4+ T cells are
one of the primary targets of HIV infection, and depletion
of these cells leads to AIDS. Thus, the HS sites mapped to
the human genome by the NHGRI should correspond to
sequences that regulate gene expression related to CD4+ T
cell mediated immune response.
In this report, we have taken advantage of the genomewide mapping of HS sites in order to evaluate the contribution of TEs to human gene regulatory sequences. The
extent of TE-derived HS sites in the human genome was
characterized, and the evolutionary conservation levels of
TE-derived versus non TE-derived HS sites were compared.
In addition, the expression and functional characteristics
of genes with TE-derived HS sites were evaluated along
with the evolutionary divergence of their sequences and
expression patterns. The results reported here indicate that
TEs have provided numerous functionally relevant HS
sites to the human genome, and these regulatory
sequences have played a role in driving functional divergence along the human evolutionary lineage.

Results and discussion
Human genome DNaseI-hypersensitive sites
A total of 14,216 DNaseI-hypersensitive (HS) sites, covering ~4.2 megabases of DNA, are mapped to the hg17 version (NCBI build 35) of the human genome sequence.
These sites consist of clusters of two or more experimentally characterized HS sites that map within 500 bp of
each other. These HS sites were defined in CD4+ T cells
and are presumed to be functionally relevant with respect
to the regulation of gene expression in these cells. Given
the functional role played by HS sites, they are expected to
be anomalously conserved in terms of their levels of
sequence divergence. This is because the evolution of
functionally important sequences is constrained by purifying selection (i.e. the removal of deleterious variants).
Indeed, this idea is the basis of the phylogenetic footprinting approach that identifies putatively functional
genomic elements by virtue of their sequence conservation [21,22]. The expectation that HS sites should be evolutionarily conserved was tested using the binary
characterization of human genome positions as conserved
or non-conserved based on analysis with the program
phastCons [23]. PhastCons employs a probabilistic hidden Markov model (HMM) that represents the levels of
DNA substitution at each site in the genome and how
these levels change among sites. The phastCons results
used here were based on a human query anchored multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of 17 vertebrate genomes.
This MSA was assembled with the program multiz [24]
from whole genome pairwise alignments generated using
blastz [25]. The HMM used by phastCons employs a single phylogenetic tree for all sites with the branch lengths

free to vary across sites. The HMM has two states – conserved and non-conserved – based on the values of the
branch length scaling parameter estimated from the data.
Alignment sites (segments) are predicted as being conserved if they are significantly more likely to have been
generated by the conserved state of the HMM.
All HS and non HS sites in hg17 were evaluated with
respect to their phastCons conservation designation. HS
sites in the human genome were found to be far more
conserved, on average, than sites non HS sites (Figure 1a):
~13% of HS sites are conserved compared to ~5% of non
HS sites. This comparison is conservative because the non
HS sites include numerous exons, most of which are conserved. The figure of 5% conserved non HS sites is consist-

ent with previous estimates for the proportion of the
human genome evolving under purifying selection [23].
The greater than two-fold difference in conservation
between HS and non HS sites, together with the large
number of genome positions evaluated, yields a highly
statistically significant difference (χ2 = 5.2 × 106, P = 0; Figure 1b). These results are consistent with previous reports
that HS sites are i-enriched in human genome regions that
align with mouse genomic sequence [17] and ii-often
located near sequences conserved in multiple species [18].
However, it should be noted that the majority of HS sites
(~87%) analyzed here are not considered conserved by
the criteria employed by phastCons. Thus, many of these
sites, which are likely to be functionally important, might
not be detected using a naïve phylogenetic footprinting
approach.
Transposable element derived hypersensitive sites
The contribution of TEs to HS sites in the human genome
was evaluated by comparing the results of a RepeatMasker
[26] analysis of hg17 to the mapped locations of the
NHGRI HS sites. There are numerous TE-derived HS sites
in the human genome: 3,229 HS sites (~23%) include TE
sequence and 11% of all positions covered by HS sites
(454,564 bp) are derived from TEs. This substantial fraction of HS sites derived from TEs is likely to be an underestimate since some TEs have diverged beyond
recognition and others may not be covered by the RepBase
library [27] employed by RepeatMasker. The relative frequency distribution of TE classes found to donate HS sites
is largely similar to genomic distribution of TEs with a
slight over-representation of SINEs and according underrepresentation of LINEs (Figure 2). This probably reflects
the fact that SINEs, such as Alus, are over-represented in
GC and gene rich regions of the genome, while LINEs tend
to be found in relatively gene poor AT-rich regions.

The evolutionary conservation of TE-derived HS sites was
compared to that of non TE-derived HS sites using the
same phastCons-based approach described previously.
HS site positions derived from TEs are far less conserved
(<1%) than non TE-derived HS site positions (~17%; Figure 3a), and the difference is highly statistically significant
(χ2 = 6.5 × 105, P = 0; Figure 3b). This finding is consistent
with the highly lineage-specific nature of TE-sequences.
Even in the human genome, where they are relatively
ancient, TEs are among the least conserved of all
sequences [1]. The lack of evolutionary conservation for
TE-derived HS sites can be taken to suggest the formal possibility these sites are not functionally relevant. However,
the analysis of gene expression data described below indicates that TE-derived HS sites do in fact play a functional
role related to CD4+ T cell-specific gene regulation. Thus,
it may be the case that TE-derived HS sites provide a specific mechanism that leads to lineage-specific regulatory

phenotypes, which in turn are important for the generation of higher level phenotypic differences between species. This interpretation is consistent with what has
previously been shown for TE-derived cis-regulatory
sequences with demonstrable roles in gene regulation, a
majority of which also show little or no evidence of evolutionary conservation [10].
Gene expression
The HS sites analyzed here were cloned from CD4+ T cells.
As such, the HS site locations in the human genome
should correspond to genes that are upregulated in CD4+
T cells. This prediction was tested using Affymetrix microarray gene expression data from the Novartis Research
Foundation SymAtlas (GNF2) [28]. The locations of all
hg17 mapped HS sites were considered with respect to the
locations of the so-called known genes from the UCSC
genome browser. HS sites were associated with a gene if
they mapped within 1-kb of the start or end of transcription for that gene, and Affymetrix probe identifiers were
associated with individual genes. The relative levels of
CD4+ T cell-specific gene expression were compared for
genes that have co-located HS sites and those that have no
HS site. Genes associated with HS sites have significantly
higher relative CD4+ T cell expression (μ = 0.48) than non
HS site (μ = -0.21) genes (Student's t-test P = 4.5e-264;
Mann-Whitney U test, P = 8.2e-300; Figure 4a and 4b).
This is consistent with a functional role for these HS sites

in driving gene expression in CD4+ T cells. Similar results,
finding HS sites near genes with demonstrable CD4+ T
cell expression, were reported previously [17,18]. In addition, there is no real difference in the levels of CD4+ T cell
expression between TE-derived (μ = 0.48) and non TE
derived (μ = 0.47) HS sites (Student's t-test, P = 0.82,
Mann-Whitney U test, P = 0.33; Figure 4b). This finding
underscores the functional relevance of TE-derived HS
sites: they too appear to drive CD4+ T cell specific expression.

cancerous) human tissue types and cell lines, were used to
group this set of genes with k-means clustering [29]. A
total of 25 clusters, containing genes with similar expression profiles, were resolved in this way, and five clusters
(2, 9, 15, 19 & 25) containing genes with pronounced
CD4+ T cell over-expression were chosen for functional
analysis. Genes with relatively high expression in CD4+ T
cells also tend to be over-expressed in other immune
related tissues and cells such as blood, bone marrow and
lymphoblasts (Figure 5). These coherent expression patterns strongly suggest a functional role related to immune

Gene ontology (GO) annotation terms were mapped to
individual genes, and the gene members of each cluster
were evaluated for the over-representation of specific GO
(biological process) terms. GO terms found to be significantly over-represented in two or more clusters are shown
in Table 1. When the gene expression clusters are considered from this functional annotation perspective, they
resolve into cluster- and function-specific groups. Most
prominent among these is the immune response group,
which unites clusters 2 and 25 (as well as 19 to a lesser
extent) and contains six immune related GO terms. The
hierarchical (parent-child) relationships among these
immune related terms on the GO graph are shown in Figure 6. The most significantly over-represented GO term
covers genes specifically involved in immune response
(GO:0006955).
The functions of the individual genes that have TE-derived
HS sites as well as immune response related expression
patterns and functional annotation (GO:0006955) are
shown in Table 2. This example further emphasizes the
specific functional relevance of TE-derived HS sites. For
instance, there are a number of T cell receptor antigens,
such as CD6, CD53, CD74 and CD97, with T cell-specific
expression patterns influenced by TE insertions. These
antigens are involved in processes like cell-cell adhesion
and signalling cascades that govern the development and
proliferation of immune cells. There are also cases of
excreted cytokines (e.g. CKLF & CCLF) that are involved in
the inflammatory response by serving as potent chemoattractants and stimulants for T cells. Finally, there are clinically relevant genes with TE-derived HS sites, such as
CCL5, which suppresses HIV by serving as a natural ligand
for the HIV coreceptor CCR5, and BCL2, which blocks the
apoptotic death of lymphocytes and can lead to lymphoma when constitutively expressed.
Comparative genomics
Gene expression and function analysis point to the importance of genes with TE-derived HS sites. However, these
same TE-derived HS sites are not evolutionarily conserved. This suggests that TE-derived HS sites may be
important in generating functional differences between
evolutionary lineages. Comparative analyses of gene
sequence and expression divergence between human and
mouse orthologs were performed to evaluate this possibility. Genes with HS sites were divided into those with TEderived sites and those with non TE-derived sites. These
two gene sets were mapped to 9,105 pairs of humanmouse orthologous gene pairs described previously [30],
each member of which has GNF2 expression data. Proteins encoded by genes with TE-derived HS sites have

slightly higher levels of sequence divergence (0.147 substitutions per site) compared to those encoded by genes
with non TE-derived HS sites (0.138 substitutions per
site). The difference between these average substitution
rates is only marginally significant (Student's t-test, P =

test, P = 0.11). However, taken together, the differences in
evolutionary divergence at the sequence and expression
level are consistent with the idea that TE-derived HS sites
help to drive evolutionary changes between lineages. The
magnitude of this effect is fairly small though, just under
10% difference for both sequence and expression, contributing to the marginal significance in each case and

indicating that many other factors are in play with respect
to the evolutionary divergence of these genes and phenotypes.

Conclusion
TEs contribute numerous HS sites to the human genome.
While TE-derived HS sites are not evolutionarily conserved, they are functionally relevant, as demonstrated by
analyses of gene expression and functional annotations.
This distinction between conservation and function can
be taken to suggest that TEs provide a specific mechanism
for driving regulatory differences between evolutionary
lineages, and comparative genomics data bear this notion
out to some extent. Genes with TE-derived HS sites are
slightly more divergent than those non TE-derived HS
sites in terms of both sequence and CD4+ T cell expression. The results reported here point to genome-scale
effects that TEs have had in shaping the regulatory evolution of their host genomes.

Methods
Human genome sequence
The May 2004 release – National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) build 35 – of the human genome
reference sequence [1] was analyzed using the UCSC
genome browser http://www.genome.ucsc.edu/[31]. The
UCSC database containing this particular release and all
associated data is referred to as hg17. The chromosome
coordinates of various attributes mapped onto the hg17
genome sequence were downloaded using the UCSC
Table Browser retrieval tool [32]. The Table Browser
retrieval tool was also used to perform a number of logical
set operations between specific tables (see below) that
allowed for the identification of co-located genomic
attributes.
Hypersensitive sites
DNaseI-hypersensitive sites (HS) from CD4+ T cells were
characterized as described [17-19]. The HS sites have been
mapped onto the hg17 sequence and their genome coordinates were retrieved from the table named nhgriDnaseHs. Only clusters of more than on HS site that map
within 500 bp of each other are mapped onto hg17.
Transposable elements
The locations and identities of all hg17 TE sequences were
characterized using the RepeatMasker program http://
www.repeatmasker.org/[26], which uses the RepBase
library [27] of repeat sequences. The genome coordinates,
along with the class, family and name designations, for
TEs were retrieved from the table named rmsk.
Gene expression and function
Human and mouse microarray gene expression data are
from the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/20

Foundation SymAtlas (GNF2) [28]. These data were
retrieved from the table named gnfAtlas2. This table stores
relative expression values for 79 different human tissues
and/or cell types (conditions). Relative expression levels
are computed as follows: Two replicate microarray experiments were performed for each condition, and for each
individual probe, the expression signal intensity values
were averaged for each of the 79 pairs of experiments.
Then, for each probe, each of the 79 condition-specific
averages was normalized by the median of all values for
that probe to determine relative expression levels; these
ratios were log2 normalized prior to analysis. Affymetrix
probe identifiers are mapped to UCSC Genome Browser
known genes and these data were retrieved from the table
named knownToGnfAtlas2. The known genes are based
mRNA data from the NCBI Reference Sequence (RefSeq)
database and GenBank along with protein data from UniProt. The chromosome coordinates for the known genes
were retrieved from the table named knownGene. After
probe-to-gene mapping, relative CD4+ T cell expression
levels were compared for different sets of human genes.
Gene expression profiles were visualized and clustered, by
k-means clustering, using the program Genesis [29]. The
Pearson correlation coefficient was used to compute pairwise similarities between gene expression profiles. Individual clusters with high relative levels of CD4+ T cell
expression, as well as high expression in related tissuetypes, were chosen for further functional analysis. Clusters
(i.e. groups of genes) were evaluated with respect to overrepresented Gene Ontology (GO) [33] functional annotation terms using the program GOstat [34]. The biological
process subset of the GO hierarchy was used along with
the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) human GO
mapping. A 2 × 2 contingency table was used to compare
the relative frequency of GO terms in the coexpression
cluster test set (observed) versus the relative frequency of
GO terms in the background set of all human GO terms
(expected) using the χ2 test, or the Fisher's exact test is the
expected value<5. The Benjamini False Discovery Rate correction for multiple testing was used to adjust the resulting P-values. GO annotation terms that were found to be
overrepresented in two or more different clusters were
chosen for further analysis. Individual gene functions
were explored using the NCBI Entrez Gene database http:/
/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=gene. The
graphical (parent-child) relationships among GO terms
related to immune response were characterized using the
GeneInfoViz program [35]. GO term significance levels
were color coded using the program matrix2png [36].
Comparative genomics
Conserved hg17 genomic sites were characterized using
the phastCons program [23]. Alignment, using blastz [25]
and multiz [24], and comparison among 17 vertebrate
genome sequences were used to characterize conserved

Page 10 of 14

Biology Direct 2006, 1:20

sites. The genome coordinates for conserved sites were
retrieved from the table named phastConsElements17way.
Absolute differences between the relative levels of CD4+ T
cell expression were calculated for human and mouse
orthologous genes pairs described previously [30]. The
evolutionary divergence between human and mouse
orthologous proteins was measured as the number of substitutions per site using the Poisson Correction distance
[37].

Reviewer comments:
This paper provides compelling evidence that TEs did contribute significantly to the evolution of novel regulatory
sections in humans and other organisms by using an elegant and innovative combination between genomics with
microarray gene expression data analyses. The authors
show that up to one-fourth of the human DNAse I hypersensitive sites actually stem from TEs that serve important
immune response functions in especially rapidly evolving
genes. Due to the extreme lineage-specific expansion/
silencing dynamics of TEs in different host systems
absence of evolutionary conservation of TE-derived HS
sites as reported here is not surprising. Therefore these
data are not contradicting their functional relevance as
important cis-regulatory sections but demonstrate that
mobile DNAs in general do provide a highly attractive repertoire of structural and functional information patterns
to the host. Even after their successful inactivation via
host-directed silencing mechanisms such TE-derived cisregulatory sections can if proven successful be adopted by
the host genome for serving novel and innovative regulatory functions. It would be highly interesting to perform
comparative genomic analyses between human and chimpanzee orthologous TE-derived HS sites in the near future.
Author's response
We would like to thank Dr. Miller for taking the time and effort
to review our manuscript. Dr. Miller suggests comparative
genomic analyses between human and chimpanzee orthologous
TE-derived HS sites. This is a good idea and may help to settle
an issue, raised by Dr. Itai Yanai (Reviewer #2 below), concerning the role of TE-sequences as space holders versus the
actual contribution of TE sequences to human gene regulation.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/20

Reviewer Comments:
Marino-Ramirez and Jordan show in this paper that HS
sites are significantly more conserved in sequence than
non-HS sites although HS sites containing TE-derived
genes are far less conserved that HS sites lacking TE's. In
terms of gene expression, the authors show that TEderived genes and non-TE derived genes in HS sites are as
likely to be expressed in CD4+ T cells. Taken together,
these results lead to the conclusion that TE's are useful in
promoting gene expression evolution. This is an interesting notion. I imagine that TE's insertion may be instrumental in modulating expression patterns by altering the
spacing among transcription binding sites as well as disrupting some motifs through their insertion. Thus their
effects on gene expression may be conferred solely by their
role as space holders consequently freeing the actual TE
sequence to drift.
Indeed the authors also find that TE-derived genes evolve
slightly faster in terms of sequence and expression. However the signal is so weak that it places into question the
generality of this finding. One straightforward interpretation is that since in all likelihood most TE's that happen
to lie at HS sites do not contribute to the evolution of gene
expression, these dilute the signal to its observed weak
level.
Overall, these findings are important and should further
prompt research to attempt to distinguish those TE's
which contribute to genomic function from those that do
not.
Author's response
We would like to thank Dr. Yanai for taking the time and effort
to review our manuscript. Dr. Yanai proposes the interpretation
that "most TE's that happen to lie at HS sites [that] do not contribute to the evolution of gene expression." Indeed, the evolutionary divergence in CD4+ T cell expression levels for genes
containing TE-derived HS sites is only marginally greater than
that seen for genes with non TE-derived HS sites, and we point
this out in the text of the manuscript. However, the functional
relevance of TE-derived HS sites is strongly supported by their
association with genes that have relatively (significantly)
higher levels of CD4+ T cell expression (Figure 4).In addition,
genes with TE-derived HS sites have slightly higher sequence
substitution rates, on average, than genes with non TE-derived
HS sites. Taken together, these lines of evidence point to a
potential role for TE-derived HS regulatory sites in facilitating
the evolutionary divergence of human genes. To more carefully
examine this issue, we plan to investigate regulatory changes of
genes with TE-derived HS sites across species at different levels
of evolutionary divergence from the human lineage.

Dr. Yanai also raises an interesting point about the role that TE
sequences may play as 'space holders' as opposed to contributing
specific regulatory sequences. Spatial changes among promoter
elements caused by TE insertions may certainly have important
functional consequences. On the other hand, there are a
number of known, experimentally verified, cases of TE
sequences providing specific cis-regulatory binding sequences.
We are currently investigating the relative rates of evolution for
TE sequences that co-locate with regulatory regions versus those
that do not, among species that cover a range of evolutionary
divergence from human, to further investigate this possibility.

Reviewer Comments:
The paper reports analysis of hypersensitive sites (HSs),
comparing HSs containing transposable elements (TEs)
and HSs in general. Given that HSs are likely to correspond to regulatory regions and tend to be conserved, the
large fraction of TE-containing HSs is surprising. Still,
even the latter are shown to be functionally relevant. This
leads to an important conclusion about the role of TEs in
the evolution of regulation.
A main problem of this study is the deficit of controls.
Basically, only two samples are analyzed, TE-HS and
nonTE-HS. For instance: 23% HSs contain TEs and 11%
HS positions are covered by TEs (page 7) – is it a lot or
not? What would be expected if there were no correlation?
(given that >50% of the human genome is TE-derived, I
suspect that, not surprisingly, HS tend to avoid HS – but
what about other classes of functional regions?)
There is no difference in gene expression between TE-HS
and nonTE-HS sites (page 9) – this is nice, but, again,
what about other classes of genes, e.g. dependent on the
degree of conservation in their upstream regions.
Section "Gene function": what genes were subject to clustering in order to find over-represented GO annotations –
all HS genes? TE-HS and nonTE-HS genes separately? Further, in the last paragraph of this section, it should be
explicitly mentioned that it describes just an example, not
an exhaustive list.
Section "Comparative genomics": missing controls are
genes without HS in the same GO categories and just
genes without HS: without it, it is difficult to appreciate
the difference between the TE-HS and nonTE-HS genes.
On the other hand, the results of this paragraph are quite
interesting: assuming that TE-HS genes recently experi-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/20

enced a change in regulation (resulting in change in
expression), one could expect positive selection towards a
new role. It might be interesting to apply the McDonaldKreitman test to check this hypothesis. But again, more
controls with other classes of genes are needed.
Overall, I think that, although the obtained results are
interesting, they are somewhat preliminary. To make the
emerging picture much less shallow and enhance the
authors' main point about the contribution of TEs to the
evolution of regulation in the human genome, they
should consider, where appropriate, the following control
groups of genes: genes without HS, genes with non-conserved (but not TE-derived) HS, non-HS genes in the same
GO categories as identified in the "Gene function" section.
Author's response
We would like to thank Dr. Gelfand for taking the time and
effort to review our manuscript. Dr. Gelfand calls attention to
a 'deficit of controls', in several places, pointing out that only
two samples are analyzed: TE-HS versus non TE-HS containing
genes. Importantly, we have analyzed a third class of genes,
namely those that do not have any co-located HS sites characterized in CD4+ T cells (non HS). This latter class of genes has
significantly lower levels of CD4+ T cell expression than either
class of HS site containing genes (TE-derived or non TEderived; Figure 4).This underscores the functional relevance of
both classes of HS sites characterized in CD4+ T cells, TEderived and non TE-derived, with respect to CD4+ T cell specific expression. Additional analysis of this third class of genes
yields slightly more ambiguous results related to the evolutionary divergence of human gene expression patterns. Non HS
containing genes have average levels of CD4+ T cell expression
divergence that are intermediate to those seen for TE-HS and
non TE-HS containing genes. This is in keeping with the relatively weak signal seen for the differences in the average evolutionary divergence of CD4+ T cell expression levels (as well as
gene sequence divergence) across different classes of genes, and
related issues were raised by the other reviewers. We have been
careful to point out this caveat in the manuscript and plan to
perform additional evolutionary comparisons (as described in
the answers to Reviewer 1 & 2 above), for instance on more
closely related species, which may help to resolve the issue of the
contribution of TE-derived HS sites to host gene regulatory
divergence.

The point raised about 11% of HS sites being covered by TEs is
also germane. This fraction is indeed less than you would expect
by chance alone given that the genome consists of ~50% TEderived sites. Clearly, not all TE-derived sites in the human are
functionally relevant in terms of expression and many accumulate simply by virtue of the selfish replicative properties of the
elements, i.e. without regard to any adaptive benefit they provide to the host genome. In fact most TE insertions into regula-

tory regions are probably deleterious, and this is consistent with
previous results that have shown exclusion of TE sequences from
proximal promoter regions. Nevertheless, the fact that a substantial fraction of human gene regulatory sites is derived from
TE-sequences underscores the potential for such elements to be
co-opted, from time-to-time, to serve some role for the host
genome in which they reside.
In the Gene function section, we have clarified that genes with
TE-derived HS sites were clustered by k-means analysis of their
tissue-specific expression patterns. Clusters with pronounced
CD4+ T cell expression levels (e.g. Figure 5)were then selected
for functional analysis with GO. In addition, as per Dr. Gelfand's suggestion, we explicitly point out that we describe an
example, not an exhaustive list, in the last paragraph of this section (i.e. the data in Table 2).
