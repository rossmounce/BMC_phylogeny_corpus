Abstract
Background: The bananaquit (Coereba flaveola) is a small nectivorous and frugivorous emberizine
bird (order Passeriformes) that is an abundant resident throughout the Caribbean region. We used
multi-gene analyses to investigate the evolutionary history of this species throughout its
distribution in the West Indies and in South and Middle America. We sequenced six mitochondrial
genes (3744 base pairs) and three nuclear genes (2049 base pairs) for forty-four bananaquits and
three outgroup species. We infer the ancestral area of the present-day bananaquit populations,
report on the species' phylogenetic, biogeographic and evolutionary history, and propose scenarios
for its diversification and range expansion.
Results: Phylogenetic concordance between mitochondrial and nuclear genes at the base of the
bananaquit phylogeny supported a West Indian origin for continental populations. Multi-gene
analysis showing genetic remnants of successive colonization events in the Lesser Antilles
reinforced earlier research demonstrating that bananaquits alternate periods of invasiveness and
colonization with biogeographic quiescence. Although nuclear genes provided insufficient
information at the tips of the tree to further evaluate relationships of closely allied but strongly
supported mitochondrial DNA clades, the discrepancy between mitochondrial and nuclear data in
the population of Dominican Republic suggested that the mitochondrial genome was recently
acquired by introgression from Jamaica.
Conclusion: This study represents one of the most complete phylogeographic analyses of its kind
and reveals three patterns that are not commonly appreciated in birds: (1) island to mainland
colonization, (2) multiple expansion phases, and (3) mitochondrial genome replacement. The detail
revealed by this analysis will guide evolutionary analyses of populations in archipelagos such as the
West Indies, which include islands varying in size, age, and geological history. Our results suggest
that multi-gene phylogenies will permit improved comparative analysis of the evolutionary histories
of different lineages in the same geographical setting, which provide replicated "natural
experiments" for testing evolutionary hypotheses.

Background
We previously used mitochondrial DNA analyses to
describe the history of population expansion and diver-

gence of the bananaquit (Coereba flaveola), the most abundant and widely distributed songbird in the West Indies,
which also occurs in the humid tropics of continental

America [1-3]. The geographic distribution and relationship of mtDNA RFLP haplotypes suggested that populations of this species were periodically invasive, and then
quiescent. Here we increase our sample of populations
and genes to dissect more finely the population history of
bananaquits.
The bananaquit is a small nectivorous and frugivorous
emberizine bird (order Passeriformes) that is an abundant
resident throughout the West Indies, except for Cuba [46]. On the continent, it is widely distributed from southern Mexico through much of South America. Geographic
variation in plumage coloration led to the recognition of
41 subspecies throughout the range of the bananaquit [7],
but mtDNA RFLP analysis failed to support many of these
distinctions [3]. The mtDNA analyses also revealed levels
of genetic divergence between some populations within
the range of genetic differences observed between species
[8,9].
Building on our earlier studies of the bananaquit [1-3], we
have now included representatives of more populations
from the West Indies and the continent, expanded our
nucleotide sample of the mitochondrial genome of each
individual to 3744 base pairs, and have added at least
2049 base pairs representing three nuclear gene regions.
Our phylogenetic analysis is rooted by the addition of five

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/240

individuals of three species of emberizid finches representing three genera.
Our principal objectives were to determine the ancestral
area of C. flaveola, to infer the number and directions of
colonization events within the West Indies and between
the islands and the continent, and to assess the power of
nuclear versus mitochondrial genes to inform analyses of
colonization history and subsequent population dynamics. Our phylogenetic results locate the geographic ancestral area of the bananaquit in the region of the Greater
Antilles and Bahamas, and strongly support the hypothesis that continental bananaquits were derived from West
Indian ancestors. In addition, comparisons of mitochondrial and nuclear gene genealogies exposed a complex and
dynamic history of bananaquits in the Greater and Lesser
Antilles that would have remained masked without
recourse to both maternal and biparental genealogical
markers.

Results
Sequencing, nucleotide composition and saturation
We obtained clean sequences for all 43 C. flaveola distributed within the West Indies and South-central America
(Figure 1) and for six outgroup samples, with a few exceptions, for six mitochondrial genes and three nuclear genes
(see additional file 1). All sequences were submitted to

Cloning was performed on nine samples for BFib5, 10
samples for Rag1, and two samples for CHDZ. Cloning
error rate was estimated to be about 0.1% and cloning
errors were eliminated from cloned alleles.
Several properties of the data were examined to ascertain
the utility of the genes for phylogenetic analysis (additional file 2). None of the mitochondrial genes exhibited
stop codons when translated into amino acids. A test of
homogeneity indicated that sequences had similar base
frequencies across taxa (p values for all genes were above
0.99; data not shown). As expected, mtDNA sequences
showed an anti-guanine bias, except for ND6, which
showed an anti-cytosine bias and is the only one of the six
genes encoded by the L strand; all other protein-coding
mitochondrial genes are encoded by the H strand.
The majority of variable sites in the mitochondrial datasets were third-position substitutions, as expected for protein-coding genes. The mitochondrial sequence dataset
included more variation than the nuclear dataset, with a
mean percentage of variable sites ranging from 4.8 to 6.2
for mitochondrial genes compared to 0.3 (RAG1, a protein coding region) to 1.8 for nuclear genes.
We calculated the relative substitution rate between mitochondrial and nuclear data by dividing the net average
mitochondrial distance and the net average nuclear distance between the Bahamas individuals and the rest of the
C. flaveola phylogeny. The mean substitution rate was
approximately 16 times slower for nuclear genes than for
mitochondrial genes.
Plots of the transition/transversion ratio against uncorrected distances indicated that nucleotide substitution in
the mitochondrial genome was not saturated (data not
shown). All plots were linear whether plotted by position
or by gene. Thus, all nucleotides were employed in the
ensuing phylogenetic analyses of C. flaveola.
Phylogenetic analyses: outgroups
The closest relatives to C. flaveola [10] chosen here as outgroups to root our phylogenies (i.e. Tiaris olivacea, Loxigilla
portoricensis and Melanospiza richardsoni) were divergent by
at least 11.2% from a mitochondrial perspective and at
least 2% from a nuclear perspective.
Phylogenetic analyses: congruence among tree topologies
using different approaches and different genes
Phylogenetic trees generated using the three approaches –
MP, ML and Bayesian – were congruent for both mitochondrial and nuclear datasets. We also failed to reject

homogeneity of phylogenetic trees based on each mitochondrial gene region independently (p = 0.3) or each
nuclear gene region independently (p = 0.07). Therefore,
for the subsequent phylogenetic analyses, we combined
all six mitochondrial genes for the mitochondrial dataset
and all three nuclear genes for the nuclear dataset. Concatenation of the different genes for nuclear data can be
problematic as independent sorting of alleles in different
parts of the genome and stochasticity of lineage sorting
may lead to erroneous species trees [11,12]. However, our
results should be unaffected by this issue because the
nuclear and mitochondrial trees are congruent, with the
exception of the mtDNA of Hispaniolan birds (Figures 2
and 3). The GTR+I+G model of evolution was selected
using the AIC criterion in Mr ModelTest for both the mitochondrial and the nuclear datasets.
Phylogenetic analysis using mtDNA
When describing the phylogeographic results, we use the
following area name codes: LA = Lesser Antilles; PR =
Puerto Rico; GA = Greater Antilles; SCA = South and Central America; BH/QR = Bahamas/Quintana Roo; DR =
Dominican Republic (island of Hispaniola); JA/CY =
Jamaica/Cayman Islands). A consensus phylogenetic tree
based on a Bayesian analysis combining all six mitochondrial genes identified four major mitochondrial clades
representing BH and QR, GA (except PR), LA (including
PR), and SCA (Figure 2). Relationships were strongly supported with marginal posterior probability values ≥ 0.99
for all 15 major nodes.

The continental (SCA) clade of bananaquits was sister to
the PR and LA clades, which were imbedded within the
GA (excluding PR) clades. This topology indicates derivation of the continental clade of bananaquits from within
the GA. Within the PR/LA clade, sequences from PR had a
sister relationship to the rest of the clade, and bananaquits
on Grenada and Saint Vincent form a distinct phylogenetic group sister to populations in the northern LA.
Within the SCA clade, samples from Central America
(Panama and Belize) were grouped and distinct from
samples from South America. Within South America, two
groups were distinguished: birds from Trinidad and Venezuela and birds from Peru and Bolivia. A sample from
Mexico (Biological Station of Los Tuxlas, Veracruz)
sequenced with ND2 (M. Miller, pers. comm.) fell within
the Central America group (data not shown) when added
to our mitochondrial data.
Phylogenetic analysis using nuclear DNA

(3) DR together with isolated haplotypes from Montserrat, Barbados, Saint Lucia and PR, and (4) PR, LA and SCA.

lotypes with PR/LA haplotypes and the distinctiveness of
DR and JA/CY haplotypes. Nevertheless each gene shows
a specific pattern. For example, BFib5, the most variable
gene, unites the four DR and seven LA/PR haplotypes, a
group that is separated from the other sequences by five
nucleotide changes. CHDZ, the least variable gene, separates with only one nucleotide change the JA/CY samples
on one side and DR samples on the other side from the
rest of the phylogeny (Figure 4).
Mitochondrial versus nuclear phylogenetic analyses
In comparison with the mitochondrial tree, the tree based
on nuclear data resolved the more recent divergences
poorly. For example, the nuclear data grouped the continental samples with those from the LA. Nonetheless, the
nuclear phylogeny was consistent with the mitochondrial
tree in the basal branching pattern for C. flaveola within
the West Indies. The distinctiveness of DR birds in the
nuclear tree was surprising given their relative proximity
to JA/CY birds in the mitochondrial tree. Because the discrepancy between mitochondrial and nuclear data suggests a distinctive phylogenetic history for the DR
population, we sequenced eight additional DR individuals with both mitochondrial (ATPase) and nuclear
(BFib5) genes. Those additional sequences confirmed that
DR birds grouped with CY and JA birds from a mitochondrial perspective and formed a separate clade from the
other populations from a nuclear perspective (data not
shown).

Estimates of population splitting times
The likelihood-ratio test based on the six mitochondrial
genes failed to reject the null hypothesis of rate constancy
(-lnL = 9243.85 enforced tree and 9217.02 non enforced
tree, χ2 = 53.66, df = 40, p = 0.073). Therefore, to estimate
divergence times, we used linear mtDNA substitution
rates of 1.5 and 3% Ma-1, which span the range of most
calibrations (see "Methods" for justification [13,14]).

The average genetic distance between BH/QR birds and all
other populations was 0.0562 ± 0.0037, placing the
ingroup root between 1.75 and 3.99 Mya. The average
divergence between the GA and LA/PR/SCA groups was
0.0529 ± 0.0038, indicating that the split between those
two clades occurred at approximately the same time, i.e.,
1.75 to 3.99 Mya. The divergence between the LA/PR clade
and the SCA clade was 0.0234 ± 0.0025, implying a split
about 0.69 to 1.72 Mya. Finally, PR diverged from the LA
approximately 0.34–0.93 Mya.

Discussion
In this paper, we have described phylogeographic relationships of bananaquit populations to determine the history of colonization within the Caribbean Basin.
Additional analyses using coalescent models to infer population parameters require a different sampling regime
(i.e., more individuals per population and more nuclear
genes) and will be reported separately (Bellemain et al.
unpublished).
We provide a well-resolved phylogeny of the bananaquit
in the West Indies, based on multiple genes. Aspects of the
bananaquit phylogeny highlight points of general interest
that are not commonly appreciated for birds. First, we
infer that populations sampled in the Greater Antilles and
Bahamas were the source of mainland colonization for C.
flaveola, which is the reverse of the usual continent-toisland direction of colonization. Second, our study demonstrated the dynamic nature of the bananaquit distribution, resulting from several phases of overlapping
expansions, especially through the Lesser Antilles. Third, a
discrepancy between mitochondrial and nuclear haplotypes among bananaquits on Hispaniola (Dominican
Republic samples) suggested the recent replacement of the
mitochondrial genome by introgression from Jamaica.
Mitochondrial versus nuclear data: relative coalescence
time, sorting of ancestral polymorphism and inferences
concerning phylogenetic history
DNA sequences of mitochondrial genes provide a single
estimate of a species phylogeny based on one linkage
group [15]. In our analysis of bananaquit phylogeny, we
adopted a multi-gene approach based on three nuclear
genes as well as DNA sequences for six mitochondrial
genes. The more rapid coalescence of mtDNA represents

an advantage as it is more likely to resolve nodes with
short internode distances, and the probability of incomplete lineage sorting is reduced compared to nuclear DNA
[16,17]. However, an evolutionary reconstruction based
on multiple independent genes increases confidence that
the true species tree has been recovered, and improves
phylogenetic resolution by averaging out potentially misleading effects of ancestral polymorphisms [16,18,19].
Furthermore, analytical problems resulting from the stochastic nature of lineage sorting and nucleotide substitution are reduced with an increased sample of genes and
nucleotides. Our aim, here, was to explore the evolutionary history of the bananaquit populations within the West
Indies from the vantage points offered by the different
genes independently and collectively, considering their
different mutation and substitution rates, coalescence
times, modes of inheritance and effective population
sizes.
We obtained a well-resolved phylogeny of C. flaveola
based on analysis of the six mitochondrial genes. The substitution rate of bananaquit mtDNA was high relative to
the observed rate of lineage splitting, as evidenced by
abundant synapomorphies and complete lineage sorting
(reciprocal monophyly) of the major clades. The data
exhibited no saturation and approximated clock-like
nucleotide substitution. Thus, we are confident that the
tree presented in Figure 2 represents a strongly supported
hypothesis of matrilineal relationship.
In contrast, nuclear genes demonstrated considerably
lower resolution regarding the phylogenetic relationships
of bananaquit populations. The substitution rate of the
nuclear genes was, on average, 16 times slower than the
mitochondrial genes, and thus closely related clades
strongly supported by the mitochondrial data (e.g., north
central LA sister to Grenada/St. Vincent, and JA/CY sister
to DR) were not distinguished by the nuclear data. Nonetheless, the allelic divergence at nuclear loci and the relative frequency of nuclear alleles across populations
(Figure 4) clearly identifies the genetic distinctiveness of
the bananaquit clades we have named "Bahamas",
"Jamaica" and "Puerto Rico", and lends strong support to
the hypothesis that these clades separated early in the
diversification of Coereba.
The slow nuclear sorting rate relative to population diversification resulted in many examples of incomplete lineage sorting compared to the mitochondrial perspective.
Alternatively, the nuclear data could be interpreted as
revealing abundant gene flow mediated by male bananaquits, biparental gene flow followed by localized episodes of selective sweeps acting on the mitochondrial
genome, or drift associated with reduction in female population size. We suspect incomplete lineage sorting
because deep in the bananaquit phylogeny both the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/240

nuclear and mitochondrial data consistently identify the
same clades, with the single exception that individuals on
Hispaniola (DR) have mitochondrial DNA closely related
to JA/CY bananaquits, whereas the nuclear markers are
allied with those on PR and the north central LA.
Phylogenetic history of the Dominican Republic
population on Hispaniola revealed by the discrepancy
between nuclear and mitochondrial data
Nuclear markers separate DR from JA/CY birds, whereas
those populations are grouped in the same clade from a
mitochondrial perspective. This surprising result was confirmed by sequencing eight additional samples from this
population for nuclear (BFib5) and mitochondrial
(ATPase) genes (data not shown). Recent introgression of
JA/CY mitochondrial haplotypes into the DR population
is the most likely explanation of conflicting positions of
the DR samples in the nuclear and mitochondrial trees
(Figures 2 and 3). Although JA/CY mtDNA completely
replaced the local DR mtDNA, we found no evidence of
introgression in the nuclear genome. The challenge is to
understand the complete introgression of the JA mitotype
against a predominately DR nuclear background.

Mitochondrial genomes are particularly susceptible to
introgression, although this phenomenon is not clearly
understood (see [15] for a review). The ca. four-fold
smaller effective population size of the mtDNA genome
compared to the nuclear genome implies a higher probability for introgression by mtDNA. However, this outcome would be relatively unlikely if the number of JA
immigrants was small relative to the population of resident DR bananaquits. Of course, if immigration from JA
coincided with a population crash of Hispaniolan bananaquits, the likelihood of stochastic fixation of the JA
mtDNA clade would have increased accordingly.
Alternatively, mitochondrial introgression could have
been favoured by selection, while the nuclear genomes of
the two populations were incompatible. This type of selection-driven introgression has been demonstrated in Drosophila from mtDNA microinjection studies [20] and
more recently in wild goats from a molecular phylogenetic study [21]. The authors of the latter study suggested
that proto-Hemitragus mtDNA could have invaded the
ancestral population of Capra because the former were
better adapted to high altitudes. However, we cannot
imagine differences in the selective environments of basal
bananaquit populations that might have led to the selective advantage of the JA mitochondrion, considering that
the major islands of the Greater Antilles have a similar
range of environments.
A third hypothesis is that sexual selection could account
for the observation, much in the same manner as hypothesized for Dendroica occidentalis warblers along the west

coast and islands of British Colombia [22]. In this case,
hybrid JA/DR males would have a mating disadvantage,
slowing the introgression of nuclear genes relative to the
mitochrondrial genomes passed on only by the females.
Each backcross generation would dilute the contribution
of JA nuclear alleles, while JA mitotypes might become
fixed by chance. However, unless the JA mitochondrion
experienced a selective advantage, this scenario is likely
only in the case of greatly reduced DR populations.
Other biological processes that can create topological
incongruence between gene trees include lineage sorting,
paralogy, and lateral gene transfer [23]. These alternatives
can easily be discounted in the case of DR bananaquits.
First, because several independent nuclear gene sequences
support the complete divergence of the nuclear genomes
of JA/CY and DR birds, the combination of DR nuclear
and JA/CY mitochondrial genomes is not likely the result
of incomplete lineage sorting of an ancestral polymorphism in nuclear alleles. Although scenarios implying
gene duplications and gene deletions could be inferred for
one nuclear gene only, it is highly unlikely that the same
scenario may have occurred independently and identically in the three unlinked nuclear genes (RAG-1, Bfib5
and CHDZ). Indeed, the absence of substantial divergence
between JA/CY and DR mitochondrial genomes indicates
recent derivation. Second, phylogenetic trees using paralogous sequences may be misinterpreted if one assumes
that the nuclear sequences are orthologous. Orthologous
genes derive from the same locus whereas paralogous
genes derive from different loci that originated by gene
duplication [24]. However, reconstructing an erroneous
gene tree based on paralogy or gene duplication/deletion
is highly improbable because it would imply one multiple-gene or genome-wide duplication event at the root of
the tree, a panmictic DR/JA/CY population until recently
(necessary to explain the similar mitochondrial
genomes), and several recent nuclear gene deletions.
Finally, lateral gene transfer other than by hybridization/
introgression can happen when an organism incorporates
genetic material from another distantly related organism,
and this can create topological incongruence between
gene trees. However, animals seem to be largely unaffected by this phenomenon [25] and it has never been
reported for birds.
The evolutionary history of bananaquits
The mitochondrial phylogeny pictured in Figure 2 confirms the phylogeographic structure of bananaquits
revealed by the earlier RFLP analysis [3]. Regional mtDNA
haplotype clades displayed levels of sequence divergence
typically in excess of 2%, with the largest distances exceeding 5% (e.g., BH versus other populations). The nuclear
DNA data confirm the mtDNA-based hypothesis of early

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/240

divergence amongst bananaquit populations today
revealed by three highly differentiated regional assemblages: BH, JA/CY, and PR/LA/SCA.
Bananaquit lineages representing the BH, JA and PR were
probably isolated soon after the initial geographic spread
of the group in the GA. Subsequent expansions from the
BH and JA were geographically restricted. Bananaquits
from the BH probably spread to the Yucatán Peninsula of
Mexico early in the history of that clade based on the
mtDNA sequence of a single bird collected from QR (note
that bananaquits from the coast of Veracruz group with
other Central American birds, and that the species does
not occur elsewhere on the Yucatán Peninsula, except for
islands off the coast of Quintana Roo [26]. The sister relationship of this QR individual and the BH sample could
place the root of the bananaquit phylogeny on the continent, independently of the widespread and more recent
SCA clade. A more likely interpretation is that the QR
individual represents relict population of a separate invasion from the Greater Antilles now restricted primarily to
Cozumel Island. This raises the intriguing possibility that
it is a relict of a former divergent population of bananaquits on Cuba, which would have been a likely source of
colonization from the GA to QR. It seems unlikely that
bananaquits never existed on Cuba. Their current status
has been defined as "possible permanent resident" on
cays off the northern coast of Cuba (Ciego de Ávila and
Camagüey Provinces) and on the island itself at Gibara
(Holguín Province), but breeding has not been established [27]. To summarize, bananaquits from coastal
Yucatan deserve additional study, but data in hand suggest that the matriline allied to the BH is narrowly
restricted in comparison to the predominant mtDNA haplotype clade in Middle America.
The lineage of bananaquits found today on JA/CY is also
narrowly distributed from a joint nuclear and mtDNA perspective. Given the predominance of the JA/CY matriline
in the DR, however, it is clear that at least female bananaquits have moved between the islands relatively recently.
Thus, migration or range expansion of the JA clade group
has been recent in comparison to that of the BH mtDNA
haplotype clade.
Nuclear and mitochondrial data indicate that most of the
contemporary distribution of bananaquits results from
the spread of birds whose descendents are now found in
PR, LA and SCA. The geographic expansion of this clade is
relatively recent in comparison to the original diversification of bananaquits, and the first split of this expanding
lineage (PR clade) separated island from continental
birds. Subsequent diversification on the mainland led to
reciprocally monophyletic mtDNA haplotype clades, one
predominant in South America and the other in Middle

America. In the islands, PR populations became isolated
from LA populations, and then bananaquits in the north
central LA became separated from the populations on
Grenada and St. Vincent.
The pattern of evolutionary quiescence followed by geographic expansion is also repeated in the mtDNA record
of bananaquits in the LA. This history was clearly revealed
in our earlier research [3] based on a mtDNA RFLP analysis of a larger sample of birds per island, and demonstrated that bananaquits had recently expanded their
distribution through the northern islands in the chain.
However, we did not anticipate the northward expansion
of the north-central Lesser Antilles bananaquit clade all
the way to the British Virgin Islands. It is particularly noteworthy that bananaquits crossed the Anegada Gap, which
serves as a significant biogeographic divide in the West
Indies, to colonize islands that would have been connected to PR, or nearly so, during Pleistocene low sea level
stands. This seems improbable if the British Virgin Islands
had been occupied by the Puerto Rican population of
bananaquits, and suggests that a catastrophic event might
have caused the extirpation of populations in the northern LA and the British Virgin Islands. The alternative scenario of north-central LA bananaquits displacing PR like
birds in the British Virgin Islands as a result of competitive
superiority is lessened by the evident failure of this lineage
to invade Puerto Rico. Our sampling in PR included
coastal areas on the eastern end of the island close to the
Virgin Islands.
At the other extreme of the LA, Grenada and Saint Vincent
have maintained their evolutionary separation from
islands to the north, but no significant separation from
one another as measured genetically or morphologically.
Both islands harbor melanistic forms of the bananaquit,
as well as shared mtDNA haplotypes, that are not found
on islands to the north. The evolutionary connection
between Grenada and St. Vincent might reflect their separation by a shallow bank of islands (the Grenadines) that
would have connected the islands during Pleistocene low
sea level stands [28]. This is not the case for other islands
in the LA, which are mostly (excluding St. Kitts-Nevis and
Antigua-Barbuda) separated one from the other by deepwater channels.
Phylogenetic support for taxonomic distinctions among
subspecies
Our molecular systematic appraisal of bananaquits permits us to assess phylogenetic support for taxonomic distinctions among the many named subspecies. Two
subspecies groups were recognized by Paynter [7]: bahamensis (from the Bahamas) and flaveola (representing all
other populations), but most populations in the West
Indies have received specific or subspecific epithets at

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/240

some time in the past, Bond [29] recognizing 16 subspecies. Our data confirm the genetic distinctiveness of the
bahamensis birds; however, the flaveola group encompasses mtDNA haplotype clades that are nearly as divergent as flaveola and bahamensis groups. For example the
JA/CY/DR clade is approximately 5% diverged in mitochondrial sequence from the remainder of the populations recognized as the flaveola subspecies by Paynter [7].
Additionally, subspecies such as portoricensis on Puerto
Rico represent distinct evolutionary lineages. However,
more often than not closely related or identical mtDNA
haplotypes encompass several subspecies. For instance,
the northern LA mtDNA haplotype clade includes four
subspecies (sancti-thomae, bartholemica, martinicana, and
dominicana), the two Panama bananaquits comprise different subspecies (columbiana and aterrina), and birds
from Bolivia and Peru belong to three different subspecies
(intermedia, dispar and alleni). Although finer genetic distinctions consistent with morphological differences
between populations may exist, this study adds evidence
that presently recognized bird subspecies often do not
represent historically and phylogenetically equivalent
evolutionary lineages (e.g., [30]).
Revision of earlier phylogenetic and biogeographic history
of the bananaquit
Our analysis also allows us to review the phylogenetic and
biogeographic history of the lineage. Bond [31] interpreted the distribution of C. flaveola in the West Indies as
resulting from two invasions, one from South America
spreading north through the LA and west to JA, and the
other from Central America spreading north and east to
the BH. Our initial mitochondrial RFLP-based survey of
bananaquits [3] indicated a different, more complex history. However lacking samples from bananaquit populations on Dominican Republic and the Bahamas, as well as
a suitable outgroup, we could not satisfactorily address
Bond's [31] hypothesis of a continental origin for the species [3]. Results reported here confirm and extend the earlier molecular phylogenetic analyses.

The sister-group relationship between SCA bananaquit
populations rejects Bond's hypothesis, which predicted
that the two continental regions should be most closely
related to the island populations founded from South and
Central America, respectively.
Islands as the ancestral area of the bananaquit and
"reverse colonisation" of the continent
Because species diversity on islands decreases with distance from continental source areas [32,33], biologists
have assumed that colonization of islands or archipelagos
is a one-way process, and that "reverse colonization" to
the mainland against a diversity gradient rarely, if ever,
occurs. Our study confirms previous indications that

island species also can colonize continental areas.
Although the depauperate biotas of remote islands and
archipelagos have little chance of recolonizing continental landmasses, near islands, such as the West Indies, have
larger biotas with fewer impediments to dispersal, considerably improving the probability of back migration, or
onward migration. Colonization from the islands to the
mainland has similarly been reported within the West
Indies for several bird species (e.g. Icterus orioles, [34];
Myiarchus tyrant-flycatchers [35]; possibly Amazona parrots, [36]). Island to mainland colonization has also been
demonstrated in monarch flycatchers from the Solomon
Islands to New Guinea/Australia [37] (see [38] for a
review).
In the case of the bananaquit, we have provided both
mitochondrial and nuclear evidence that permits strong
inference that birds from the islands have colonized the
mainland. The nesting of the South American to Panama
samples within the West Indian clades and the deep paraphyly of bananaquits from the BH and JA clade with
respect to all other bananaquits, including all mainland
birds (except the single QR individual), represent the
strongest lines of evidence that the ancestral node of the
extant lineages is most parsimoniously placed in the
Greater Antilles. Furthermore, ancestral area analysis
(data not shown) based on the Bremer method [39]
clearly excludes the continent as the ancestral area of Coereba. Finally, near outgroups for the bananaquit are principally emberizid finches from the West Indies [10]. We
cannot place the origin (stem lineage) of the species itself,
but this issue is not relevant to the present study.

sion might have occurred within the LA (including a
recent one that would have homogenized the gene pool
across the northern Antilles). However, direct colonization of South America from GA seems unlikely for several
reasons. First, bananaquits, which do not flock and are
not strong fliers, would have difficulty making a long
over-water flight. Second, virtually all colonization events
in the West Indies occur in stepping-stone fashion from
one island to the next, rather than over long distances
[2,40]. Third, remnants of the nuclear genome of the
South American birds in PR and LA (Figure 3) favour dispersal through the islands rather than directly from the
GA.
We envision colonization from GA to SCA through LA as
occurring in the following way (Figure 5). First, bananaquits spread from the DR to PR and through the LA
approximately 1.7 to 4 Mya. Evidence of this expansion is
seen in the clade of haplotypes in the nuclear phylogeny
recovered from DR, PR, and LA. This expansion did not
reach the continent of South America.
A second expansion would have occurred from PR
through the LA to SCA about 0.7 to 1.7 Mya, as seen in the
phylogenetic link between SCA, PR, and LA populations,
exclusive of other GA populations, particularly DR (Figure
2). This is also corroborated by the fact that the combined
nuclear genes (Figure 4) show the affiliation of continental haplotypes with LA and PR haplotypes, to the exclusion of DR haplotypes. It is also possible that the DR/PR/
LA and PR/LA/SCA clades represent the same expansion,
followed by lineage sorting.

To conclude, islands, including the West Indies, might be
significant sources of biodiversity for continents, and we
emphasize the importance of considering reverse colonisation for interpreting biogeographic patterns.
Diversification and range expansion of Coereba flaveola in
the West Indies: alternative scenarios
Alternative scenarios of diversification and range expansion, from the Greater Antilles/Bahamas, can explain the
phylogenetic patterns observed in both the mitochondrial
and nuclear gene trees. They differ mainly in whether the
continent was invaded directly from the Greater Antilles
or through the Lesser Antilles.

In the simplest scenario, bananaquits expanded from the
GA to independently colonize the LA (through PR) and
the continent (directly from the GA) approximately 1.7 to
4 Mya, through an Eastern route. Considering the affinity
of South American genotypes to those on PR rather than
DR or JA, a Western route can be excluded. This scenario
is consistent from a mitochondrial point of view. It does
not exclude the possibility that several phases of expan-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:240

A third, more recent expansion from PR through the LA,
but not to the continent, is indicated by the shared mitochondrial haplotypes of those two populations about
0.34 to 0.93 Mya. After the first and second expansions,
PR birds would have had sufficient time to diverge from
DR and continental populations from a mitochondrial
perspective, but incompletely from a nuclear perspective.
This would explain why the LA clade does not include DR
mitochondrial sequences but does retain remnants of the
DR nuclear genome.

Conclusion
Analysis of genetic diversity in the bananaquit shows that
the different rates of nuclear and mitochondrial genome
processes, and incongruities between nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenies, can be used to dissect the often
complex phylogeographic history of populations. We
emphasize the importance of including multiple genes
with distinct evolutionary histories. Our study is the first,
to our knowledge, to demonstrate such biogeographic
complexity for a single species. First, we demonstrated
that the ancestral node of the extant bananaquit lineages
is most parsimoniously placed in the Greater Antilles,
indicating that islands, including the West Indies, might
be significant sources of biodiversity for continents. We
suggest that the "reverse colonisation" phenomenon
deserves more systematic attention in phylogenetic analyses, and assessing its significance is of prime importance
in studies of biogeography and ecology. Second, several
phases of colonization and mixing among islands
occurred before the bananaquit populations became isolated long enough to develop reciprocal monophyly in
mtDNA. Third, the mixed nuclear and mitochondrial
genomes in the Dominican Republic and the remnants of
old Dominican Republic nuclear lineages in the Lesser
Antilles suggest that expanding bananaquit populations
mix with resident populations during expansion phases.
Thus, genetic compatibility is maintained over periods
exceeding three million years and perhaps much more,
despite morphological and song differentiation. This does
not exclude the possibility that expansions can follow
extinctions of local populations or that colonists can competitively exclude local populations, as suggested by nonoverlapping distributions of recently expanded mtDNA
lineages in several species of Lesser Antillean birds [41].

Methods
Sampling
We obtained tissue or blood samples from one to three C.
flaveola individuals from 16 islands within the West Indies
(Antigua, Bahamas, Barbados, Barbuda, British Virgin
Islands, Cayman Islands, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Jamaica, Martinique, Montserrat, Puerto Rico, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent) and seven
countries in Middle and South America (Belize, Bolivia,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/240

Mexico, Panama, Peru, Trinidad and Venezuela) (Figure
1). No voucher specimens were collected in the West
Indies because identification of species is not an issue. The
sampling locations cover the entire distribution of bananaquits within the West Indies, and are broadly representative of the geographic range of the species in Central and
South America. Bananaquits occur only accidentally in
Cuba and Florida [42]. To root the bananaquit phylogeny,
we used the following outgroups: two individuals of Tiaris
olivacea (from Puerto Rico, PRTOL and the Cayman
Islands, CYTOL), two Loxigilla portoricensis (Puerto Rico,
PRLPO1, PRLPO2), and one Melanospiza richardsoni (Saint
Lucia, SLMRI), which are recognized as close relatives of
C. Flaveola [10]. Altogether, our sampling included 49
individuals. Additional file 1 presents details for sample
localities. Blood and tissue collection was non-destructive
as described in Seutin et al. [3]. On Grenada and St. Vincent, we sampled bananaquits of the typical yellow form
as well as the melanistic form [43-45].
DNA extraction and sequencing
Total cellular DNA was extracted from most samples using
the CTAB extraction procedure described in [3]. The following six mitochondrial genes were amplified: ATP synthase 8, ATP synthase 6 (ATPase 8, ATPase 6, 852 bp);
cytochrome b (cyt b, 717 bp), cytochrome oxidase (COI,
651 bp), Nadh dehydrogenase 2 (ND2, 1023 bp), Nadh
dehydrogenase 6 (ND6, 501 bp). In addition, we amplified three nuclear genes: the recombination activating
gene-1 (RAG-1, 1009 bp [46]), the fifth intron of the beta
fibrinogen gene (Bfib5, 545 bp [47]), and the chromohelicase-DNA-binding protein, which is sex-linked
(CHDZ, 495 bp [48]). In total, we sequenced 3744 nucleotides of mitochondrial genes and 2049 nucleotides of
nuclear genes. Negative controls were included in all PCR
amplifications to confirm the absence of contaminants.
Amplification of PCR products was verified by visualization on 1.5% TBE agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. PCR products were then cut from 1.5% TAE agarose
gels and left to incubate for two hours at 46°C in presence
of gelase.

Sequencing reactions were conducted with the gel purified
products and BigDye chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and cleaned using Sephadex G50 purification columns (Sigma). Sequencing reaction products
were run on an ABIPrism 3130xl automated sequencer
(Applied Biosystems). DNA sequence fragments were
edited and aligned using Sequencher software version 4.5.
We cloned samples in which nuclear sequences exhibited
more than one heterozygous nucleotide site (double
peaks of approximately the same height present on both
strands) or double peaks extending through a portion of
the entire sequence due to allele length variants. Cloning

was accomplished using the Promega cloning kit (pGEMT Easy Vector System II). Ligated plasmids were used to
transform Escherichia coli competent cells (JM109)
selected for inserts by growth on LB plates with IPTG and
X-Gal (5'-3'). Positive colonies were grown overnight in
LB and up to eight colonies were isolated in 50 μL of purified water. PCR, cycle sequencing, and purifications were
then performed as previously described. For some individuals we sequenced one colony per clone and used the
resulting sequence to deduce the sequence of the second
allele from the original sequence based on the PCR amplification of genomic DNA. Where the original sequence
was not interpretable, we sequenced between three and
six colonies per clone to obtain clean sequences for both
alleles. Cloning errors were identified by comparing multiple sequences and their consensus, and the error rate was
estimated by dividing the number of cloning errors by the
number of nucleotides sequenced.
Our preliminary data indicated discordant nuclear and
mitochondrial trees for Dominican Republic bananaquits
(see results), which warranted increased sampling of individuals and genes. Accordingly, we sequenced the mitochondrial ATPase and nuclear BFib5 genes for eight
additional birds from diverse locations across the Dominican Republic (additional file 1)
Phylogenetic analyses
Nucleotide composition, nucleotide bias, percentage of
variable sites and parsimony informative sites for both
mitochondrial and nuclear genes were analyzed using
PAUP* and Sequencher 6.1 [49]. We assessed saturation
in the mitochondrial dataset by plotting the transition/
transversion ratio against uncorrected genetic distance for
the combined mitochondrial dataset.

Phylogenetic analyses for each mitochondrial gene independently, for each nuclear gene independently, and for
combined datasets followed verification of the homogeneity of gene regions in combination. Congruence among
tree topologies generated using the six mitochondrial
genes combined or among the three nuclear genes combined was tested with the partition homogeneity test in
PAUP*, with 1000 heuristic replications [50,51]. In turn,
we used three approaches to infer relationships among
bananaquits. Maximum parsimony (MP) analysis was
performed using heuristic searches with TBR branch swapping and support for interior nodes was assessed using a
bootstrap approach (1000 replicates). Maximum likelihood (ML) analyses used MrModelTest v2.2 [52] to select
the best-fit nucleotide substitution model for the data.
Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were conducted using
MrBayes v.3.0b4 [53]. We estimated posterior probability
distributions by allowing six incrementally heated
Markov chains to proceed for two millions generations,
with samples taken every 1000 generations. The Markov

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/240

chain of interest was considered to have converged when
stationarity was reached, which we determined by plotting the posterior probability values of nodes against generation time in a cumulative fashion. Burn-in samples
were discarded from the two separate analyses, and the
remaining samples were combined to create a consensus
phylogeny and to estimate posterior probability values
and branch lengths.
After fixing the topology of the consensus Bayesian tree,
we implemented a |2 test of log-likelihood ratios to compare the difference in support between trees with and
without a molecular clock enforced [54] so that we could
evaluate the constancy of nucleotide substitution rate
within the combined mitochondrial gene dataset. We analyzed the nucleotide substitution rate only for bananaquit
lineages and did not include the outgroups.
We failed to reject the null hypothesis of rate constancy in
our data. It was not possible to obtain a robust calibration
for the application of the molecular clock, first because
passerines are poorly represented in the fossil record, and
are difficult to identify to species when they do occur, and
secondly because calibration information such as radiometric ages of heterochronous sequences or inferred ages
of lineage splitting events [13] are not available for the
studied species. However, our aim was to provide an
approximation (not precise dating) for times of lineage
splitting. Therefore, we used a broad range of linear substitution rates of 1.5–3% My-1 reported for bird studies
[13,55]. To estimate divergence times, we considered the
net average genetic distance between pairs of clades and
its standard deviation, using a Tamura-Nei model calculated using MEGA software, version 3.1 [56] and divided
the mean genetic distance by 1.5–3%.
We employed the ancestral area method from Bremer [39]
to infer the direction and sequence of island and mainland colonization of C. flaveola in the West Indies. This is
a cladistic method based only on the topology of the tree,
which is used to infer a gain-loss ratio for each branch of
a simplified area cladogram. The cladistic analysis was
based on the topology of the Bayesian tree for the combined mitochondrial dataset.
We used the software NETWORK 4.111 [57] to estimate
gene genealogies for each of the nuclear genes and for the
combined set of nuclear genes, and to construct unrooted
minimum spanning networks. A partition homogeneity
test in PAUP*, with 1000 heuristic replications, was used
to test for incongruence among tree topologies generated
using the seven nuclear genes.
