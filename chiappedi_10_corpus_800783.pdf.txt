Corpus callosum agenesis and rehabilitative
treatment
Matteo Chiappedi1,2,3*, Maurizio Bejor1,4

Abstract
Corpus callosum agenesis is a relatively common brain malformation. It can be isolated or included in a complex
alteration of brain (or sometimes even whole body) morphology. It has been associated with a number of neuropsychiatric disorders, from subtle neuropsychological deficits to Pervasive Developmental Disorders.
Etiology and pathogenetic mechanisms have been better understood in recent years, due to the availability of
more adequate animal models and the relevant progresses in developmental neurosciences. These recent findings
are reviewed (through a MedLine search including papers published in the last 5 years and most relevant previously published papers) in view of the potential impact on children’s global functioning and on the possible
rehabilitative treatment, with an emphasis on the possibility to exploit brain plasticity and on the use of the ICF-CY
framework.
Background
Clinical presentation

Corpus Callosum Agenesis (CCA) is among the most
common brain malformations observed in humans [1].
Its incidence varies as a function of both diagnostic
techniques and sample populations: in the general population, its estimated prevalence is 3-7 per 1000 birth,
while in children with developmental disabilities it is 2-3
per 100 [2-4]. It is often associated with other anomalies
such as Chiari II malformation (also known as proper
Chiari malformation) with abnormal development of
cerebellar vermis and medulla oblongata, which tend to
descend into the foramen magnum, usually accompanied by myelomeningocele, basilar type encephalocele
and disorders of neural migration (which occurs concurrently in human brain development) such as schizencephaly, lissencephaly, pachygyria, marked neuronal
heterotopias. Recent neuroradiological findings [5] suggest that CCA might lie along a dysgenetic spectrum,
including all commissural anomalies as part of an overall cerebral dysgenesis. Abnormal sulcation is common
and suggests more diffuse white matter dysgenesis in
these foetuses [6], even if some authors do not consider
this as an additional brain abnormality [7]. The isolated

form of CCA is however listed in OMIM (217990) and
ORPHAnet (ORPHA200).
Patients with CCA have a clinical syndrome which
had originally been thought to be a consequence of
hemispheres’ disconnection. Recent studies, however,
pointed out that patients with CCA have abnormal
microstructure and reduced volume of the Ventral
Cingulum Bundle, suggesting that abnormalities in
intrahemispheric white matter tracts may be an important factor [8]. Another interesting recent finding is a
reduction in number of Van Economo neurons, large
spindle-shaped neurons localized to anterior cingulated
cortex and fronto-insular cortex, in patients with CCA;
this is considered another consequence of the genetic
disruption that caused the agenesis [9].
Retrospective chart reviews and cross-sectional cohort
studies report that 30 - 40% of cases have identifiable
causes; however, up to 75% of cases with isolated complete CCA do not have an identified cause [10].
The possible genetical etiology of CCA has been studied both in mouse models [11] and in humans [12].
No single gene has been proved to be implied in all
patients with CCA, given that the corpus callosum can
be missing in many different disorders: this probably
reflects complex underlying mechanisms [10]. Environmental factors are relevant as well: this is evidenced by
the effect of ethanol on corpus callosum development,

so that CCA is a relatively common feature of Fetal
Alcohol Syndrome [13].
Diagnostic issues

CCA is a disorder of midline prosencephalic development, together with agenesis of septum pellucidum,
affecting the commissural plate.
Other disorders included in this group are septo-optic
dysplasia (affecting the commissural but also the chiasmatic plates) and septo-optic-hypothalamic dysplasia
(affecting the commissural, chiasmatic and hypothalamic
plates).
In CCA the superomedial aspects of the lateral ventricles are deformed by the fibers of the cerebral hemispheres that were destined to cross in the corpus
callosum and that, with agenesis, course instead longitudinally as the bundles of Probst. Crescentic lateral
ventricles result from the impression of medial ventricular wall by these bundles. The other relevant neuroradiological sign is the evertion of the cingulated gyri
which can be seen in coronal scans.
Ultrasonography can be helpful, even if MRI is
thought to be far superior at least for partial agenesis.
Morphologically, two types of CCA can be distinguished: in type 1 axons are present but unable to cross
the midline, forming large aberrant fiber bundles (Probst
bundles), while in the less frequent type 2, axons fail to
form [1].
The most relevant sonographic sign in sagittal views is
the superior displacement of the third ventricle, while
parasagittal views show that the medial cortical sulci
radiates superiorly instead of horizontally and the
absence of the normally echogenic pericallosal sulcus.
Moreover, coronal scans show absence of callosum and
Probst longitudinal bundles indenting the dorsomedial
aspect of lateral ventricles.
With partial agenesis, the posterior portion is nearly
always affected, with the notable exception of the anterior involvement that occurs when partial agenesis is
associated with the holoprosencephalies [14]. It is perhaps understandable that partial agenesis is determinated by disturbances occurring later during the
maturational phase compared to complete agenesis.
In MRI, the four components of the corpus callosum are
best viewed on sagittal imaging although its relationship to
the cerebral hemispheres is best shown on coronal images.
The corpus callosum is a densely packed white matter
structure, with high signal on T1-weighted and low signal
in T2-weighted images after the age of 24 months. Up
until that age, MRI imaging showns that myelinization is
more advanced in the posterior parts of the corpus callosum when compared to the anterior regions [15]. Diffusion Tensor Imaging and tractography have been used to
study inter-hemispheres connectivity. Given however the

Page 2 of 7

difficulties in distinguishing a complete absence of the
corpus callosum from a severe hypoplasia, the term
“abnormal corpus callosum” has been proposed as a way
to catch all observed abnormalities.
Prenatal diagnosis of complete callosal agenesis is
feasible from the midtrimester onwards by expert sonography [16]. In the axial view, suspicious findings are
absent cavum septi pellucid and teardrop configuration
of the lateral ventricles with possible ventriculomegaly;
the non-visualization of the corpus callosum at transfontanellar ultrasound in either the sagittal or coronal plane
is diagnostic [17]. More subtle findings, such as hypoplasia and partial agenesis of the corpus callosum, may
also be recognized antenatally [18]. Fetal MRI is worthy
of recommendation in order to reinforce a difficult
sonographic diagnosis and at the same time to exclude
possible additional cerebral anomalies which may be
overlooked at ultrasound but may affect the outcome
considerably [19].
Developmental origin

Prosencephalic development occurs by inductive interactions under the primary influence of prechordal mesoderm mainly during the second and third months of
gestation. Since the major inductive relationship of concern is between the notochord-prechordal mesoderm
and the forebrain and it occurs ventrally at the rostral
end of the embryo the term “ventral induction” is used.
Development of the prosencephalon can be divided in
three sequential events: prosencephalic formation
(which is altered in aprosencephaly and atelencephaly),
prosencephalic cleavage (altered in holoprosencephaly
and holotelencephaly) and midline prosencephalic
development.
Midline prosencephalic development occurs from the
latter half of the second month through the third month,
when three crucial thickenings or plates of tissue become
apparent (commissural, chiasmatic and hypothalamic
plates). The earliest components of the corpus callosum
appear at approximately 9 weeks gestational age; by
12 weeks gestational age and independent corpus callosum is definable at the commissural plate. The latter is a
structure derived from cellular material filling a sulcus
which becomes evident in the dorsal portion of the
lamina terminalis during the seventh gestational week.
The commissural axons from the cortex are attracted to
the midline mainly by chemoattractans of the phylogenetically conserved netrin family [20]. Commissural axons
then cross the midline and project alongside it, without
recrossing. An explanation for the failure to recross is
that midline cells, in addition to expressing netrin proteins, also express the repellent protein Slit, which signals
repulsion by activating the Roundabout (Robo) receptor.
The growth cones can cross once because they do not

Chiappedi and Bejor Italian Journal of Pediatrics 2010, 36:64
http://www.ijponline.net/content/36/1/64

initially express Robo protein on their surface, but upon
crossing, with a mechanism that is still poorly understood, they upregulate Robo protein on their surface and
therefore become responsibe to Slit, which prevents them
from recrossing. Several other molecules, such as cell
adhesion molecules, laminins, receptor protein tyrosine
kinases, receptor protein tyrosine phospatases and semaphorins also have important roles as mediators of axon
guidance [21]. Moreover the role of glial cells cannot be
overlooked [22]. Bi-directional growth, beginning at the
interface of the genu and body, leads to the development
of the genu, followed by the body, the splenium and the
rostrum; this process is completed by approximately
20 weeks of gestation [23,24]. Subsequent thickening of
this structure occurs as a result of growth of crossing
fibers during organizational events [25]. In the last
30 years the understanding of callosal development has
increased because transgenic mouse models became
available and studied [26].
Another important research line is the one considering
chromosomal rearrangements with CAA as a possible feature. The number of patients with CAA in which chromosomal rearrangements are found has increased following
technical improvements (i.e. from conventional cariotyping to subtelomeric and array-CGH analysis) [27]. Candidate genes have been located expecially on chromosome
1 [28-30], but also on 3, 7, 8, 13, 15, 18, 21 [31].
A recent attempt to classify all midbrain-hindbrain
malformations has been proposed by Barkovich, Millen
and Dobyns [31]. According to a comprehensive review
of embryological and genetic findings, these authors
have proposed four main categories:
• malformations secondary to early anteroposterior
and dorsoventral patterning defects or to misspecification of midbrain or hindbrain germinal zones;
• malformations associated with later generalized
developmental disorders that significantly affect the
brainstem and cerebellum;
• localized brain malformations that significantly
affect the brain stem and the cerebellum;
• combined hypoplasia and atrophy of putative
prenatal onset degenerative disorders.
This classification could explain the developmental
origins of malformations associated to CAA and the fact
that an abnormal corpus callosum is found in many
severe disorders of midbrain - hindbrain development
[27]. A list of the most commonly syndromes associated
with CCA is shown in Table 1.

Rehabilitation
The brain’s complexity arises from its connectivity, as is
highlighted by the disproportionate increase in white

Page 3 of 7

matter volume throughout primate evolution [32]. Since
the corpus callosum, with over 190 million axons, is the
largest structure connecting the two cerebral hemispheres [33], its importance is self-evident. Although
there has been debate about whether the connections
are primarily excitatory (integrating information across
hemispheres) or inhibitory (allowing the hemispheres to
inhibit each other to maximize independent functions),
they appear to be primarily excitatory [34] with the secondary result to allow brain asymmetries and therefore
independent functions [35].
Since there is a great variability in clinical outcome,
different theories have been suggested. Interhemispheric
connections could be re-routed through the anterior
commissure [36] or other structures could be important,
such as the recently discovered sigmoid bundle (which
is a long heterotopic commissural tract, connecting the
left frontal lobe with the right occipitoparietal cortex,
seen in partial CCA) [37]. The long-known notion that
CCA has a better outcome when is not associated with
other brain malformations has been confirmed in recent
studies [38]. On the other hand, the comparison
between complete and partial CCA has revealed conflicting data, with multiple studies showing no difference
in behavioural and medical outcomes between the two
conditions, whereas one earlier study reported a worse
outcome for individuals with complete CCA [39,18,12].
Since the percentage of completely “normal” patients
is decreasing in more recent studies, one could hypothesize that a pattern of deficits in high-order cognition
and social skills has become apparent as more individuals with primary CCA but without obvious neurological deficits have been identified and assessed with
sensitive standardized neuropsychological measures [10].
A long follow up is therefore required even in apparently “benign” clinical conditions [40].
In general terms, three clinical patterns seem to be
relatively common:
1) severe neuropsychiatric deficit, usually seen in
complex brain malformative diseases in which CCA
is only one feature (and often not the most relevant
one, in terms of consequent disability);
2) other neurodevelopmental diseases, including autism [41], without a well defined role of CCA in the
etiology of the disorder;
3) apparently benign conditions, with IQ in the normal range but relevant neuropsychological deficits.
These ones include impairment of abstract reasoning
[42], problem solving [43], comprehension of syntactic and linguistic pragmatics [44,45,42], and category
fluency [42]. Parents frequently report health concerns such as feeding or sleep issues, elimination
problems and unusual tolerance for pain [46,47].

Behavioural and emotional factors are frequently
associated: tendency for deficient social cognition in
individuals with ACC seems to stem from a combination of difficulty integrating information from
multiple sources (e.g. verbal and visual ones), using
paralinguistic cues for emotion, and understanding
nonliteral speech [48]. This has been hypothesized
to be the consequence of largely intact right hemisphere mechanisms supporting psychophysiological
emotional response without having the possibility to
integrate the intact mechanisms of the left hemisphere, due to the lack of communication and perhaps to a dysfunction of the anterior cingulated
cortex [49]. This problems with emotional arousal
can be the cognitive substrate for the psychopathological feature known as “alexitimia” (i.e. “lack of
words to describe emotions”). A conduct disordered
behaviour can stem from the inability to appropriately respond to complex demands, particularly
under conditions of high stimulation, in a way somewhat similar to what happens in Rourke’s Non Verbal Learning Disorder [50].

Options for rehabilitation
One could wonder why rehabilitation units should challenge a disorder which originates from a more or less
specific morphological alteration of the brain. There are

many good reasons for doing that, both general and specific to CCA.
The general reason lies into the concept of CNS plasticity. It is well known that life events (obviously including rehabilitative treatments) can change the way our
brain works and even its shape, if they have appropriate
intensity and time length. This is particularly true for
developing brains, but a place for CNS plasticity is now
recognized even for adults and aged people.
The most important specific reason is the evidence
that experience can modify established functional patterns. This has been shown to be true for instance for
intermanual interactions [51]: rehabilitative treatment
can be seen as an occasion to offer an experience which
might in the long run modify neurological pathways
through CNS plasticity. Studying sound lateralization in
subjects with callosotomy, callosal agenesis or hemispherectomy, some authors have suggested that “congenital absence of the corpus callosum may result in
processes of neural plasticity that compensate for the
reduced transfer of auditory spatial information between
the cortical hemispheres” [52]. It should also be considered that the corpus callosum reaches a size comparable
to the adult one by 2 years of age, but it is one of the
last systems to complete myelination, a process which
starts at the fourth month of pregnancy but continues
into adulthood [53].

Chiappedi and Bejor Italian Journal of Pediatrics 2010, 36:64
http://www.ijponline.net/content/36/1/64

An important rehabilitative target is therefore the possibility to exploit CNS plasticity: even if an important
structure such as the corpus callosum is lacking, we can
offer a specific exercise and a modified environment to
improve functional and structural brain adaptation. In
this way a spontaneous compensation through CNS
plasticity can be enhanced, so that more complex
stimuli and situations can be correctly processed and/or
processing time can be reduced without losing accuracy.
This rehabilitative target can be obtained through a
specific training and using an adequate setting.
Other interesting studies have shown that the ability of
patients with CCA to compensate their deficits depends
on the task constraints: this has been proven for instance
studying the ability to precisely time events in coordinate
bimanual actions [54]. CNS plasticity is likely to be insufficient to compensate any neuropsychological deficit in
any possible situation, as for instance suggested for synchronization of multimodal lateralized information [55]
or for perceptual priming [56]. This implies that another
relevant rehabilitative goal is the possibility to detect
those situation where deficits can lead to a significant
impairment and to activate helpful strategies (e.g. asking
for explanations when a metaphor is used, given the high
possibility to misunderstand its meaning). Interestingly, it
is possible that this could lead to an improvement of the
neuropsychological functioning, activating brain plasticity
that leads to a non-standard use of cerebral areas (as in
the case of language [57]).
Parents of individuals with CCA and relatively normal
neuropsychiatric conditions consistently and reliably
describe impaired social skills and poor personal insight
as the features that interfere most prominently with the
daily lives of their children [58]. Specific traits include
emotional immaturity, lack of introspection, impaired
social competence, general deficits in social judgement
and planning, and poor communication of emotions
[59,60]. Consequently, these patients often have impoverished and superficial relationships, suffer social isolation and have interpersonal conflict both at home and
at school due to misinterpretation of social clues.
This implies that parents and teachers should be
offered a counselling to help them finding ways to
approach and help these children, without being stopped
by their neuropsychological deficits but trying to overcome them with adequate strategies.

Conclusions
Some suggestions can be drawn from current scientific
literature concerning CCA.
First, the treatment should be started as soon as possible, in order to prevent secondary complications (e.g.
social exclusion due to the above described difficulties)
and to exploit CNS plasticity as much as possible.

Page 5 of 7

Patients with severe neuropsychiatric disorders (developmental delay, autistic features, mental retardation)
tend to present relevant problems quite early (usually by
the age of 3 or 4 years). However, patients should be
monitored at least up to school age, to detect more
subtle neuropsychological deficits (which can however
be significant for the patient and his/her family).
It is worth underlying that the functional diagnosis,
evaluating in detail patient’s points of weakness and
strength as well as the real possibilities of the environment to support him, should guide the choice among
these treatment options and the possible goals to look
for. In other words, one should bear in mind that the
aim of rehabilitation is improving patient’s global functioning, not just treating a single and specific part of his
body (such as the corpus callosum) or a single function
(such as inter-hemispheric connectivity in CAA).
The model proposed in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health [61] can be
useful as a frame to guide the rehabilitative treatment.
The recently published Children and Youth version of
the ICF [62] maintains the focus on the dynamic interaction between the subject and the environment (biopsycho-social model).
The subject’s functioning can be described in terms of
body structures (eventually altered, as in CCA) and
functions (i.e. physiological functions performed by one
or more structures), but also in terms of activities (i.e.
actions the subject can or cannot perform) and participation (defined as the possibility to be involved in life
situations). Activities and participation can be assessed
as a performance (i.e. what the subject can or cannot do
in his actual living environment) or as capacity (i.e. what
the subject can or cannot do without any external intervention). The environment can act as facilitators (if they
tend to increase subject’s participation) or as barriers
(if they tend to decrease subject’s participation).
This model implicitly predicts that rehabilitative
results can be much different, as they are the final
result of a combination of many factors, including the
extension of brain malformation and functional alteration, the possibility to offer a prompt and adequate
treatment and parent’s and teacher’s possibility to
adapt their behaviours to favour child’s development.
It can guide the interpretation of the assessment,
because it allows to identify problems and use the
right kind of intervention: this is especially important
for situations such as CAA, which is present (either as
an isolated alteration or as part of a complex malformative picture) in a wide range of clinical disorders.
This also implies that any rehabilitative treatment has
to be individually tailored, using different interventions
according to the specific needs and possibilities of
every single patient.

Chiappedi and Bejor Italian Journal of Pediatrics 2010, 36:64
http://www.ijponline.net/content/36/1/64

In few cases, devices of different kind can help the
child to overcome specific limitations: their use should
however be reserved to those situation where the possibility to enhance child’s functioning is too low. Possible
rehabilitative interventions can include:
• speech therapy: to improve child’s language and
reading/writing skills; different techniques are used,
according to the specific deficits and skills of the
subject;
• physiotherapy: mainly to reduce motor problems
and sequelae in complex neurodevelopmental
disorders;
• psychomotor therapy: to improve child’s development in a general meaning, using a mixture of
motor, cognitive and relational training. It combines
different play-based techniques to improve the
knowledge of oneself and of the world, through
motor functioning, with a consequent ability to
establish a relationship with the human and nonhuman environment [63];
• occupational or educational therapy: used in older
children, with both a one-to-one or small groups
approach; they tend to increase general social and
cognitive abilities using “goal directed” exercises;
• psychotherapy: usually for children with a higher
functional level. In current indexed literature, cognitive and behavioural approaches have been more
often used, so that the possible role of other psychotherapeutic approaches (e.g. psychodynamic or
inter-personal) is not clearly established,
• parent training: tries to improve parental attitude
towards their child, helping them to accept his limitations and to favour as much as possible his global
development;
• counselling for teachers: to provide the better
adapted learning opportunities.
Whatever the chosen intervention(s), the patient
should be monitored to adapt rehabilitative treatments
to his (and often to his family’s) changing needs.
