Abstract
Background: A recent outbreak of sorghum downy mildew in Texas has led to the discovery of
both metalaxyl resistance and a new pathotype in the causal organism, Peronosclerospora sorghi.
These observations and the difficulty in resolving among phylogenetically related downy mildew
pathogens dramatically point out the need for simply scored markers in order to differentiate
among isolates and species, and to study the population structure within these obligate oomycetes.
Here we present the initial results from the use of a biotin capture method to discover, clone and
develop PCR primers that permit the use of simple sequence repeats (microsatellites) to detect
differences at the DNA level.
Results: Among the 55 primers pairs designed from clones from pathotype 3 of P. sorghi, 36 flanked
microsatellite loci containing simple repeats, including 28 (55%) with dinucleotide repeats and 6
(11%) with trinucleotide repeats. A total of 22 microsatellites with CA/AC or GT/TG repeats were
the most abundant (40%) and GA/AG or CT/TC types contribute 15% in our collection. When
used to amplify DNA from 19 isolates from P. sorghi, as well as from 5 related species that cause
downy mildew on other hosts, the number of different bands detected for each SSR primer pair
using a LI-COR- DNA Analyzer ranged from two to eight. Successful cross-amplification for 12
primer pairs studied in detail using DNA from downy mildews that attack maize (P. maydis & P.
philippinensis), sugar cane (P. sacchari), pearl millet (Sclerospora graminicola) and rose (Peronospora
sparsa) indicate that the flanking regions are conserved in all these species. A total of 15 SSR
amplicons unique to P. philippinensis (one of the potential threats to US maize production) were
detected, and these have potential for development of diagnostic tests. A total of 260 alleles were
obtained using 54 microsatellites primer combinations, with an average of 4.8 polymorphic markers
per SSR across 34 Peronosclerospora, Peronospora and Sclerospora spp isolates studied. Cluster

analysis by UPGMA as well as principal coordinate analysis (PCA) grouped the 34 isolates into three
distinct groups (all 19 isolates of Peronosclerospora sorghi in cluster I, five isolates of P. maydis and
three isolates of P. sacchari in cluster II and five isolates of Sclerospora graminicola in cluster III).
Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to extensively develop SSR markers from
Peronosclerospora genomic DNA. The newly developed SSR markers can be readily used to
distinguish isolates within several species of the oomycetes that cause downy mildew diseases.
Also, microsatellite fragments likely include retrotransposon regions of DNA and these sequences
can serve as useful genetic markers for strain identification, due to their degree of variability and
their widespread occurrence among sorghum, maize, sugarcane, pearl millet and rose downy
mildew isolates.

Background
Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) is the world's 5th most important grain crop [1], and with a genome much smaller than
maize, is a model for tropical grasses of worldwide importance. It is a major source of food, feed, fiber, fuel, and
chemical feed stocks across a range of environments and
production systems. However, diseases and insects, in
addition to abiotic stresses, are major impediments to sorghum production. Among the diseases, sorghum downy
mildew (SDM), caused by Peronosclerospora sorghi, [2] is a
disease of sorghum and maize (Zea mays) [3]. SDM can
cause severe epidemics, resulting in heavy yield loss. In
the past P. sorghi has been subdivided into 'sorghum/
maize' and 'maize' infecting strains. As more information
has become available, the Peronoscleosporas have been designated as separate species, with names that indicate the
preferred host (P. maydis on maize and P. sacchari for sugarcane). Although P. sorghi can produce symptoms on
both maize and sorghum, it typically does not complete
sexual reproduction on maize, so no oospores are formed.
Sorghum and maize downy mildew (P. sorghi) reported in
44 countries and pearl millet downy mildew (Sclerospora
graminicola) reported in 51 countries around the globe are
found in most tropical and subtropical regions [4,5].
These oomycetes are both seed and soil-borne pathogens,
thus rendering crop rotation less effective in controlling
the disease. A sudden re-emergence and disease outbreak
of sorghum downy mildew resulting in significant yield
loss was noted in Wharton and Jackson counties of Texas
during the spring of 2001 and again in 2002 [6]. P. sorghi
isolates from the outbreak were found to be resistant to
metalaxyl [methyl N- (2, 6-dimethylphenyl)-N-(methoxyacetyl)-DL-alaninate] fungicide, which had been used as
an effective seed treatments for many years. Subsequently,
isolates collected from previously resistant hosts revealed
the evolution of a new pathogenic race of P. sorghi and
demonstrated a need for constant monitoring of the pathogen populations.
Philippine downy mildew of maize, caused by Peronosclerospora philippinensis (Weston) C.G. Shaw, has not been
reported in the western hemisphere, but it is a serious

problem in the Philippines where disease losses in some
fields have been 40–60% [7]. Although maize varieties
resistant to P. philippinensis have been developed in Asia,
maize hybrids currently grown in the United States are
highly susceptible to P. philippinensis and American breeding lines that are highly resistant to P. sorghi in the United
States are generally susceptible to P. philippinensis (M.R.
Bonde, personal communications). Besides maize and
sorghum [8], P. philippinensis has been reported to infect
Avena sativa L., Saccharum officinarum L., Sorghum halepense
(L.) Pers, S. propinquum (Kunth) Hitchc. [9] and Saccharum spontaneum L. [10]. Consequently, P. philippinensis is
the subject of quarantine in many countries and was listed
by USDA APHIS under CFR 7 part 331 as a "select agent"
in the US, meaning it is considered to be a major threat to
agricultural security. Because of the threat posed by P. philippinensis, a DNA sample available from the USDA, ARS
Foreign Disease-Weed Science Research Unit at Ft. Detrick, MD was included in this study. The information
gained, besides having epidemiologic significance for
maize and sorghum production, also could help resolve
confusion over the taxonomy of Peronosclerospora spp.
The population structure of P. sorghi has been previously
addressed with physical characters, such as spore size or
pathotype, which require comparative disease responses
on a series of host differential cultivars [11,12]. Conventional methodologies for the detection of different pathotypes of downy mildews of cereals have not been
satisfactory particularly for the identification of organisms
at extremely low propagule numbers and are cumbersome
for use with obligate parasites (such as plant-pathogenic
rusts and mildews), which cannot be cultured. Hence, in
tropical climates, symptoms of Peronosclerospora can be
confused with those from related downy mildew pathogens, including P. maydis, P. sacchari and P. philippinesis.
Yao et al. [13] showed that clones of P. sorghi DNA crosshybridized well on Southern blots with DNA from the
other Peronosclerospora species. While few differences were
detected among the RFLP patterns within P sorghi, different patterns were seen for the different species. Similarly,
ITS-2, an internal transcribed spacer of ribosomal genes

was different in size [14]. While potentially useful in species identification, more easily scored and highly variable
markers from locations throughout the genome are
needed for differentiating among closely related pathotypes, and to tag genes that contribute to host specificity,
race specificity, and virulence. Although polymorphisms
were detected in SDM pathotypes using RAPD-PCR, many
of the short (10 mer) primers resulted in monomorphic
banding patterns. A larger problem involved inconsistently amplified bands that varied greatly in intensity, even
in duplicate experiments [15]. As a consequence, a more
consistent procedure was sought in the present investigation for the development of microsatellite markers.
Simple sequence repeat (SSR), or microsatellites, are
hypervariable and dispersed in the form of long arrays of
short tandem repeat units throughout the genome
[16,17]. These SSRs provide codominant Mendelian
markers, much more powerful than dominant markers
and can be used to determine population genetic structure, kinship, reproductive mode, and genetic isolation
[18,19]. When compared with several other marker types,
SSR markers were superior for genetic characterization in
Aspergillus fumigatus, and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
[20,21]. Microsatellite markers have been developed for
several fungi including Magnaporthe grisea [22,23], and
another oomycete, Phytophthora infestans [24] among others. However, based on sequence searches using genome
data P. infestans and two other plant pathogenic Phytophthoras, potential SSRs have been reported to be rare [25].
In the present study, many new microsatellite sequences
comprised of dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeat structures were retrieved from genomic DNA of Sorghum
Downy Mildew (Peronosclerospora sorghi) pathotype 3
using an optimized and highly simplified biotin capture
protocol. On the basis of sequence analysis of these captured fragments, appropriate primers were designed for
amplification of these microsatellite loci and the developed microsatellites for P. sorghi were tested for the ability
to differentiate pathogenically diverse isolates of P. sorghi
and for their utility for cross-species amplification in P.
philippinensis, P. maydis (maize), P. sacchari (sugar cane),
Sclerospora graminicola (pearl millet) and Peronospora
sparsa (rose) downy mildew. Clustering analysis was performed to assess the genetic diversity and close relatedness
among 34 isolates including the different species of
downy mildews.

Methods
Pathogen samples and DNA isolation
A total of 19 isolates of Peronosclerospora sorghi including
P1 (metalaxyl susceptible), P3 and P6 (both metalaxyl
resistant and susceptible) pathotypes collected in different
years from different parts of Texas where the disease out-

burst occurred were included in this study. In addition,
DNA samples from P. philippinensis (one), P. maydis (five),
P. sacchari (three) were obtained from Dr. Douglas G. Luster, USDA/ARS, Foreign Disease-Weed Science Research
Unit, Ft. Detrick, Maryland, USA and DNA samples of
Sclerospora graminicola (five) and Peronosopora sparsa (one)
available in Dr. Magill's lab, Dept. of Plant Pathology &
Microbiology, Texas A&M University, College Station,
Texas, USA, were also included in the present study (Table
1). For DNA isolation, conidia were collected from
infected leaves as follows: leaves were washed with cold
sterile water and placed abaxial side down on a screen in
a petri plate, covered with moist paper towels and allowed
to sporulate in the dark overnight at 23°C [26]. Spores
collected in sterile water were used for DNA extraction.
After removing excess water, conidial suspensions were
washed a few times with 70% ethanol and frozen for
lyophilization. The dried sample was powdered in liquid
nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. DNA was extracted
using a MasterPure Yeast DNA Purification kit (EPICENTRE Biotechnologies, Madison, WI) and the DNA was
diluted to working concentration of 2.5 ng/μL by adding
1× TE (10 m M Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0).
Microsatellite Isolation
A microsatellite-enriched library was prepared by a simplified protocol based on the biotinylated-oligonucleotide capture methods of [27]and [28]. Further, several
steps in the biotin capture protocol were modified as
detailed by Reddy et al. [29] to optimize the frequency of
microsatellite repeats among captured genomic DNA fragments. In our protocol, no size fractionation steps or radioactive hybridizations were employed. A 500 ng sample
of genomic DNA from SDM pathotype 3 was digested for
3 h in a single reaction mixture containing restriction
endonucleases HaeIII, RsaI, and DraI (20 units of each), as
well as 50 ng of RNaseA. This digestion resulted in a
diverse population of blunt-ended restriction fragments
with an average size of ~550 bp. Digested DNAs were
purified using a QIA-quick PCR purification column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), eluted with 50 μl of 5 mM Tris-pH 8.0,
then dried completely under vacuum. The doublestranded adaptor molecule AP11/12 was prepared by mixing equal molar amounts of oligonucleotides AP11
(5'CTCTTGCTTAGATCTGGACTA3')
and
AP12
(5'pTAGTCCAGATCTAAGCA-AGAGCACA3', where p = 5'
phosphate), heating to 94°C, then cooling to 25°C over a
period of 5 h. Digested genomic DNA fragments were
resuspended in a 30-μL ligation reaction containing 100
ng of AP11/12 double-stranded adaptor and 30 Weiss
units of T4 DNA ligase. Ligation was carried out at 14°C
for 16 h. Preamplification of adaptor-ligated products was
performed using 2 μL of the ligation reaction as a template
for 10 cycles of PCR in a 50-μL reaction volume using the

single primer AP11. An annealing temperature of 55°C
was employed in all PCR reactions.
Approximately 100 ng of the preamplified product was
then added to a single reaction mixture containing 6× SSC
(0.9 M NaCl, 90 mM sodium citrate, pH 7), 0.1% SDS
(sodium dodecyl sulfate), and 200 ng each of biotinylated
oligos b(TA)30, b(CA)20, b(GA)20, and b(AGA)15,
b(TGA)15, b(ACA)15, (b = 5' biotinylation). After denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, preamplified genomic DNA
fragments were annealed in the presence of biotinylated
oligonucleotides for 1 h at 60°C, then added to 200 μg of
fresh streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads (Promega,
Madison, WI) previously equilibrated with 6× SSC. Beads
were incubated at 60°C with gentle agitation for 15 min,
then the liquid was removed by separation using a magnetic stand (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). Beads were
washed twice in 300 μL of 6× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min
at room temperature with gentle agitation. Beads were further washed twice in 300 μL 6× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min
at 60°C with gentle agitation. Finally, beads were briefly
washed twice with 6× SSC at room temperature. After
removing the final wash, captured DNAs were eluted from
the beads with the addition of 100 μL of 60°C 0.1 M
NaOH. After neutralization with 100 μL of 1 M Tris-pH
7.5, captured DNAs were desalted and equilibrated with
10 mM Tris-pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA-pH 8.0 (to a final vol-

ume of ~50 μL) using a 100-kDa MW cutoff size filtration
column (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Five μL of desalted
DNA sample were used as a template for 30 cycles of PCR
in a 50-μL reaction volume using primer AP11. Six microliters of the resulting PCR reaction (~60 ng) was cloned
into the TA-cloning vector pCR4-TOPO through topoisomerase mediated ligation (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA)
and transformed into chemically competent Escherichia
coli TOPO10. Recombinant colonies were identified by
positive selection through insertional inactivation of the
ccdB (control of cell death) open reading frame. Colonies
were transferred to 96-well microtiter plates for archival
storage.
Sequence Analysis
Recombinant bacterial colonies were inoculated into 300
μL of LB amp media in a 96-well 0.6-mL-deep plate
(Marsh Bioproducts, Rochester, NY). Cultures were agitated at 500 rpm in a HiGro high-density shaking-incubator (GeneMachines, San Carlos, CA) for 16 to 18 h at
37°C. DNA sequencing was performed by RCA (rolling
circle amplification) using Templiphi 100 Amplification
Kit (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Co. Piscataway, NJ). 0.5
μl of the bacteria was added into 5 μl of sample buffer.
The sample was denatured at 95°C for 3 minutes, and
then cooled to room temperature or 4°C. The denatured
sample was combined with 5 μl of reaction buffer and 0.2

μl enzyme mix. DNA was incubated at 30°C for 18 hrs for
Templiphi reaction. The amplified DNA was diluted 50 ul
of water. 2 ul from the diluted RCA product was
sequenced using BigDye terminator cycle sequencing
(Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using
10 pmol of M13-forward and M13-reverse primer in a 10μL reaction. Standard cycle sequencing conditions were
employed. Sequencing products were purified by DyeEX
96 kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Electrophoretic separation
of sequencing products was performed on an ABI Prism
3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). Assembly of double-stranded DNA sequence contigs
from each clone, and identification of redundancy and
overlaps between clones was performed using Sequencher
3.0 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI). Microsatellite analysis
for the identification of sequences with perfect and imperfect repeats and simple and compound repeat motifs were
identified using Simple Sequence Repeat Identification
Tool (SSRIT) database [30].
Sequence homology search
The sequences of SDM microsatellites were subjected to
homology searches using BLASTN against nucleotide collection (nr/nt) and Expressed Sequence Tags (est_others)
at National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI;
[31]).

Under Algorithm parameters the following options were
chosen to improve the results.
General parameters
Max target sequences – 100; Short queries – automatically
adjust parameters for short input sequences; Expected
threshold – 10 & Word size – 11
Scoring parameters
Match/Mismatch scores – 2,-3; Gap costs – Existence: 5
Extension: 2
Filters and Masking
Filter – low complexity regions; species-specific repeats for
fungi

Mask – Mask for lookup table only options.
Design of primers and PCR amplification
Primers were designed to the flanking region of the SSR
using PRIMER 3 software[32]. Primers were designed
without repetitive DNA and with a base composition of
greater than 40% G+C with annealing temperature
between 52°C and 58°C to yield amplification product
between 100 and 250 bp. Oligonucleotide primers were
synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville,
IA, USA. Primers selected by these criteria were evaluated
further for melting temperature, internal structure, and
propensity for primer-dimer formation using publicly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/77

accessible Worldwide Web resources (Sigma-Genosys,
The Woodlands, TX). PCR amplification was carried out
in 10 μL containing 5.5 ng of genomic DNA, 1 μL 10×
PCR buffer (Promega), 0.8 μL of 2.5 mM dNTP mix, 1 μL
each of 1 pM/μL forward and reverse primers, 1 μL of 25
mM MgCl2, and 1 U of Taq polymerase. PCR was performed for an initial denaturation of 2 min at 95°C followed by 35 cycles of 45 s at 95°C, 45 s at the appropriate
annealing temperature for each microsatellite primer pair
as highlighted in Table 1 and 60 s at 72°C, and a final
extension of 20 min. at 72°C.
Gel Analysis
The developed SSR primers with 4% SFR (super fine resolution) agarose (AMRESCO, Solon, Ohio, USA) gel electrophoresis system running with 1× TBE buffer in 4°C
using circulatory cool buffer system was used for better
resolution of polymorphic differences between downy
mildew isolates. The SSR amplification products were also
analyzed using a LI-COR-NEN® Model 4300 -dual-dye
automated DNA Analyzer. Following amplification, an
equal volume (5 μl) of PCR products of two sets of SSRs
one labeled using the IRD-700 nm and another with IRD800 nm fluorogenic forward primer were mixed. Basic
fusion dye (2 μl) (LI-COR) was added to each pooled
sample and the samples were denatured for 5 min at
95°C. Each sample (1 μl) was loaded on a 6.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea. Gels were cast using LICOR 25-cm plates with 0.25-mm-thick spacers and comb.
Electrophoresis was performed at a constant power of 40
W and a constant temperature of 47.5°C for 2 h.
Statistical analysis
Microsatellite fragments were scored as present (= 1) or
absent (= 0) across the 34 Peronosclerospora, Peronospora
and Sclerospora spp. isolates. The resulting binary matrix
was used to construct a similarity matrix using the Jaccard
coefficient, GS(ij) = a/(a + b + c) (17), where a is the
number of fragments shared by i and j, b is the number of
fragments present in i and absent in j, and c is the number
of bands present in j and absent in i. Cluster analysis was
performed using the unweighted pair group with arithmetic means method (UPGMA) [33]. PAUP 4.0* was used to
generate 1000 bootstrap replicates for testing the reliability of the dataset and to draw a consensus tree [34]. Ordination analysis was performed to study the relatedness
within a matrix by converting the pairwise distance into
Eigen vectors and values. Cluster analyses, ordination
analyses and the Mantel test were performed using
NTSYSpc (NTSYS – for Numerical Taxonomy SYStems)
version 2.1 [35].

Results
A collection of 513 colonies, picked at random from primary transformation plates, was inoculated into 96-well
culture plates for high throughput sequencing. Of the 513

clones sequenced, 170 (33%) were redundant with other
clones in the same collection. A total of 73 out of 343
clones (21%) did not contain repeat motifs. Of the
remaining 270 nonredundant clones, Sequence analysis
showed that virtually all of the inserts contained microsatellite repeat motifs matching one or more of the biotinylated oligonucleotides used in the selection process.
Out of 270 clones, 144 insert fragments (53%) were truncated within, or at the end of, a microsatellite repeat. Of
the remaining 126 non redundant clones with unique
sequences flanking both ends of the microsatellite repeats,
55 were selected for further analysis on the basis of the following criteria: (i) the length of the microsatellite was five
or greater in dinucleotide and four in trinucleotide repeat
units and; (ii) the unique 5' and 3' flanking sequences
were both of suitable structure and composition for the
design of efficient primers. Microsatellites with flanking
sequences that were highly repetitive in nature and/or had
high A+T rich nucleotides were eliminated.
Thirty six microsatellite loci containing a simple repeat
type made up 66% of the DM collection, including 28
(55%) with dinucleotide repeat types and 6 (11%) with
trinucleotide repeat types (three CAA and one each of
GTT, AGG and ACA). Of the microsatellites containing a
simple repeat type, 94% had "perfect" repeats (except
DM9 and DM16), uninterrupted by nonrepeat nucleotides. The remaining 19 SSR loci (39%) of the collection
were composed of "compound repeats" consisting of
more than one repeat type at a single locus and all were
interrupted by nonrepeat nucleotides and hence considered as "imperfect" repeats (Table 2). All the compound
repeats were combinations of dinucleotide repeat motifs
except DM45 (trinucleotide) and DM49 (combination of
tetra and dinucleotide) repeat motifs. A total of 22 microsatellites with the CA/AC or GT/TG repeat type were the
most abundant (40%) and the GA/AG or CT/TC type contributes 15% in our collection.
Of the 55 cloned SSR sequences queried in BLASTN
searches of the NCBI non-redundant genomic and EST
databases(as of July 4, 2008), only four clones DM21,
DM28, DM53 and DM55 were found to show similarity

to previous entries and these were to sequences of Phytophthora and Pythium species which are also plant pathogenic
oomycetes. Details are presented in table 3. These results
indicate that two of the cloned sequences (DM53 and
DM54) isolated from P. sorghi contain incomplete portions of genes found in known retrotransposon elements.
Primers were designed for the 55 selected microsatellite
loci using the criteria described in materials and methods.
These primers (for Table 4 see additional file 1) had an
average length of 20.7 nucleotides, with an average G+C
content of 49% and annealing temperature in a range of
50–55°C. Predicted cloned products ranged in size from
106 (DM52) to 249 (DM21) bp. These 55 new microsatellite loci described in Table 4 (see additional file 1) were
designated as "DM" (Downy Mildew). One of the 55,
DM15 was not amplified in any of the pathotypes when
resolved either in SFR agarose or LI-COR polyacrylamide
gels. DM17, 27, 40, 41, 45 and 48 were resolved with faint
expression in SFR agarose gels and with fine resolution in
LI-COR polyacrylamide gels. When used with 34 Peronosclerospora and Sclerospora spp isolates, a total of 260 alleles were obtained using 54 microsatellites primer
combinations in LI-COR polyacrylamide gels, with an
average of 4.8 polymorphic markers per SSR. In comparison, only 128 alleles were visible using 48 SSRs in SFR
agarose gels with an average of 2.7 polymorphic markers
per SSR across the same set of isolates. Four SSRs (DM12,
19, 30 and DM38) showed monomorphic expression in
SFR agarose gels but polymorphisms were detected in LICOR poly-acrylamide gels. SFR agarose gel data for 54
SSRs across species were not used further in this study.
Of the 54 SSR primer pairs, 50 produced amplicons in Peronosclerospora sorghi, 41 in P. maydis, 29 in P. sacchari, 33
in P. philippinensis, 30 in Peronosopora sparsa and 37 in Sclerospora graminicola downy mildew isolates (Table 5).
Twelve SSR primer pairs (DM 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 30, 31,
35, 49, 53 and DM54) amplified products in all six species. A total of 15 (DM 3, 8, 11, 13, 18, 27, 31, 39, 40, 45,
50, 52, 53, 54, & DM 55) and seven (DM13, 23, 24, 45,
48, 50 and DM53) produced unique bands in P. philippinensis and P. sparsa respectively. Representative examples of

the distinct banding differences for amplification products obtained with 34 Peronosclerospora, Peronospora and
Sclerospora spp. isolates using the DM9 microsatellite
primer pair are shown in Fig. 1.

The dendrogram constructed using UPGMA (Fig. 2) summarizes the interrelationship observed among 34 isolates
of different downy mildew species. With the similarity
coefficient greater than 0.84, all the 34 isolates were
grouped into three distinct clusters. In the cluster I, 18 Peronosclerospora sorghi isolates including pathotype P3 (metalaxyl sensitive) and other metalaxyl resistant isolates of
P3 and P6 pathotypes were all grouped together with a
confidence limit of 80%. Within cluster I, Metalaxyl sensitive isolates of P1 pathotype (#1, 16 and 21 from Fig. 2)

A presence (1) or absence (0) binary matrix containing
260 clear amplicons from 54 SSRs was used to generate
the genetic similarity estimates. The similarity co-efficient
ranged from 0.77 to 0.98 indicating narrow genetic distance among the isolates of the different species studied.

were distinctly separated from others with a confidence
limit of 79% and 76%. Five isolates of P. maydis and three
isolates of P. sacchari were grouped in two sub clusters
with confidence limits of 83 and 74% respectively in cluster II and five isolates of Sclerospora graminicola were
grouped in cluster III with confidence limit of 70%. The
remaining P. sparsa and P. philippinensis isolates were not
grouped into any of these three clusters and showed their
distinct uniqueness from other species. Principal coordinate analysis (PCA) was also performed to show the relationship among the 34 isolates as a three dimensional
display. In this analysis the first two principal components (having eigen value >1) explained 86% of the total
variation. Like the UPGMA clustering dendrogram, PCA
analysis placed isolates of different species of downy mildew into distinct positions (Fig. 3).

Discussion

maize strain of P. sorghi from Thailand was given specific
rank as P. zeae [13]. Legg [42] has outlined the advantages
of some of the molecular methods for studying the Peronosclerospora spp. A maize strain of P. sorghi was reported in
southern Nigeria [43]. However, Yao et al. [14] using PCR,
were unable to differentiate an isolate of SDM from maize
in southern Nigeria from sorghum/maize-infecting strains
and the identity of this pathogen remains unknown. The
problems described warrant development of simple and
powerful molecular diagnostic tools for constant monitoring of this disease. Since microsatellite regions are
highly mutable due to their propensity of addition and
deletion of repeat copies they can be used to differentiate
within and between related taxa, even at the level of individual isolates in a single species. Simple DNA- profiling
methods based on microsatellite variability provide possibilities to identify individual genotypes for studies in population genetics, ecology and taxonomy [44].

The Peronosclerospora spp. that cause downy mildew of sorghum and maize and other gramineous hosts include
some of the most destructive pathogens in the tropics and
subtropics [36] and some of them infect more than one
important crop. Of the 10 recognized species of fungi that
cause downy mildew diseases of maize, 5 currently are in
the genus Peronosclerospora [37,38]. The confusion over
nomenclature of specific pathogens involved in these diseases is a major problem in global evaluation of the
downy mildews caused by Peronosclerospora. It is difficult
to determine if research results and disease control methods developed in one area of the world might be applicable to another. In several instances, taxonomy within the
genus is confused because, at most, only slight differences
in morphology of recognized species exist [39]. With the
result of traditional approaches [40] combined with utilizing molecular techniques including isozyme analysis
[41] and PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction, [14]) the

Characterization of microsatellite loci
In the present study, a total of 55 microsatellite loci were
isolated from Peronosclerospora sorghi – pathotype P3 DNA
enriched for simple sequence motifs. We observed 33%
internal redundant motifs, likely consequences of using
two PCR amplification steps during the isolation process.
Of the sequenced clones with an insert, over 79% contained microsatellites. This is a significant enrichment as
compared to traditional microsatellite isolation protocol
[45]. However, the relatively small fragment size average
resulting from the use of three restriction enzymes in the
initial fragmentation (HaeIII, (GGCC) targets, RsaI,
(GTAC) and DraI (AAATTT)) may explain why 144 insert
fragments out of 270 clones (53%) were truncated within,
or at the end of, a microsatellite repeat. This result is in
accordance with the CM collection [46], in which
genomic DNAs were mechanically fragmented using a

high-pressure nebulizer, and a substantial portion of the
clones were truncated within the microsatellite. The most
frequent dinucleotide microsatellite motifs detected in
our libraries were (CA/AC)n or (GT/TG)n. followed by
(GA/AG)n or (CT/TC)n. In earlier studies, (CA)n repeat
motifs [47] and (AG)n repeat motifs [48] were also
detected from the ascomycetes, Podospora anserina and
Lobaria pulmonaria respectively. Approximately 39% of all
isolated loci were composed of complex intermixed
motifs, which were rarely arranged in a tandem way. This
pattern, known as cryptic simplicity [49], is common in
larger eukaryotic genomes [50]. Microsatellites identified
with trinucleotide repeats (CAA, AGG and ACA) were
found in this study with low frequencies, but seem to differ from those typically found in 14 fungal genomes
(AAG, AAC, AGC, and ATC) [51]. One trinucleotide

repeat clone (DM45) included multiple repeats in a complex pattern but no significant homology was found to
other sequences currently in GenBank.
Determining if microsatellites will be polymorphic can
only be assessed empirically, however, two considerations
can help predict if polymorphism is likely. First, as slippage during replication increases with the number of tandem repeats [52], loci in which the motif is iterated at least
eight times are desirable. Second, it may be possible to
predict the stability of a given microsatellite motif by
assessing the likelihood of "expandability" [53]. Microsatellites reflect a balance between expansion and contraction, but while there is evidence of a bias toward
increasing microsatellite size [54], very long tandem repetitions are rare [55]. In contrast, in our study, (CA/AC)n

and (GT/TG)n were commonly repeated more than 20
times, suggesting expansion to these lengths is not limited. The presence of these motifs in most fungal and
oomycete genomes suggests they would be useful microsatellites to target in different species where genome data
are not available.
Retrotransposable Elements
The presence of retrotransposon-like elements (mobile
genetic elements) plays an important role in genome evolution and such elements constitute about 5 to 10% of the
genome in eukaryotes [56]. DM55 (ACA)19 showed significant sequence homology to mitochondrial sequences in
several Phytophora species (Table 3). Two of the P. sorghi
SSR sequences were found to have a degree of similarity to
reverse transcriptases, suggesting an origin from retro-

transposons possibly present in a progenitor species. In
this study, P. sacchari and S. graminicola isolates were not
amplified with DM 21, whereas, DM53 cross amplified in
all the species studied. These results suggest the GypsyPr2 reverse transcriptase-like gene sequence as defined in
Phytopthora ramorum was not present in P. sacchari or S.
graminicola isolates. However, sequences similar to the
Phytopthora infestans GypsyPi-3a and GypsyPi-3b retrotransposon-like and to the GypsyPs-1A sequence from
Phytopthora sojae were present in all Peronosclerospora, Peronospora and Sclerospora downy mildew isolates. Primers
and probes built to take advantage of the presence of
unique differences in such retrotransposon sequences can
be useful for strain/race identification. Examples include
the work by Sastryet al. [57] with S. graminicola and Becker
et al. [58] in the basidiomycete Chondrostereum purpureum.

Gel analysis
Resolving microsatellite amplicons in polyacrylamide gels
using a LI-COR high throughput sequencing system with
fluorogenic primers results in significantly more useful
bands than resolving the same products in 4% SFR gels
stained with ethidium bromide. For example DM12, 19,
30 and 38 gave monomorphic expression in SFR agarose
gels but showed alleles with polymorphic differences in
LI-COR poly-acrylamide gels. Taken together, from combined data across 34 Peronosclerospora, Peronospora and
Sclerospora spp. isolates, an average of 4.8 polymorphic
markers were detected per SSR in LI-COR poly-acrylamide
gels versus 2.7 in SFR agarose gels. Thus the use of LI-COR
poly-acrylamide gels with fluorogenic labeled primers was
more efficient in separating bands which reflect clear cut
polymorphisms. Fingerprinting using 54 SSR primer pairs
over all the isolates resulted in 260 diagnostic alleles.
Although it is assumed that the majority of size variants
(100 to 350 bp) was due to variation in the number of the
repeat motifs, this has not been verified by sequencing.
Insertions, deletions and base substitutions in the flanking regions [59] might also account for variation in fragment length, especially when amplicons from different
species are compared.
Cross-species amplification
It has been shown that microsatellite primers developed
for a distinct species can be useful for genetic analysis in
closely related species [60], but successful transferability
depends upon the evolutionary distance between source
and target species [61]. Dutech et al. [62] reported relatively low cross-species transferability of microsatellites in
fungi. Within genera, only 34% of the loci tested could be
transferred, which appears much lower than in animals or
plants. Here, twelve SSRs (DM 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 30,
31, 35, 49, 53 and DM54) were cross amplified in samples
from 6 species of downy mildew-causing oomycetes. Successful cross-amplification simply indicates that the flanking regions are conserved across the species studied, but it
does not tell anything about the character and structure of
the fragment and additional sequencing will be necessary
to clarify the structure of these fragments. Similar findings
with successful cross amplification of SSRs in closely
related species were reported for lichen-associated fungi
[48] and in for a variety of fungal species [51]. Another
interesting feature evident from our study is the distinctness of different species as revealed by unique banding
patterns with different SSRs as evinced clearly from Fig. 1.
Unique bands were noted with DM 3, 8, 11, 13, 18, 27,
31, 39, 40, 45, 50, 52, 53, 54, & DM 55 for P. philippinensis
and DM13, 23, 24, 45, 48, 50 and DM53 for P. sparsa.
While these amplicons may be useful for diagnostics
based on unique banding patterns, the information for P.
philippinensis and P. sparsa is based on single isolates, so
data from more independent, species-verified samples
will be required to assess the degree of variation within

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/77

natural populations. Based on the species-specific clustering of isolates where multiple samples were available, distinctive fingerprints can be anticipated.
Cluster analysis
In the present study, SSR markers revealed using high
throughput LI-COR-NEN® Model 4300 -dual-dye automated DNA Analyzer have been used to resolve cryptic
genetic variation of closely related different downy mildew species that have been impossible to resolve with
morphological systematic characters. SSR fingerprinting
was conducted using 54 primer pairs and genomic similarity analyses derived from qualitative data grouped isolates of samples of downy mildew according to host
specificity (sorghum, maize, sugarcane, pearl millet and
rose) whose taxa had been uncertain based on morphological criteria. In this study, metalaxyl sensitive P3 isolate
(#2 in Fig. 2) in cluster I grouped with all other metalaxyl
resistant isolates, suggested that metalaxyl resistance may
have originated in a P3 isolate to give rise to the recent
outbreak, consistent with results of based on AFLP molecular characterization [15].

However, mating and recombination involving metalaxyl-resistant genotypes and other isolates, along with
selection in favor of resistance would narrow the genetic
base and can account for the high similarity (approximately 89%) among all 19 P. sorghi isolates in cluster I. P.
maydis and P. sacchari isolates in cluster II were grouped
into two sub clusters with high similarity coefficient
(approx. 82%) indicates that corn and sugarcane downy
mildew isolates have narrow genetic differences, showing
more genetic similarities with each other than other Peronosclerospora species. The single isolates of P. philippinensis and P. sparsa were not grouped with any of the three
clusters and showed their uniqueness due to their distinct
banding pattern with different microsatellite primer combinations as detailed earlier. The three-dimensional comparison is compatible with cluster analysis and provides a
good visual comparison of the genetic similarities and differences of the isolates. Fig. 3 clearly depicted the unique
identity of P. philippinensis from other species. This display
shows that the genetic distance between P. philippinensis
and P. sacchai is very narrow. Similar findings with close
phylogenetic relationship was recorded through isozyme
analysis between P. philippinensis and P. sacchari isolates
from Taiwan [26,63] and by RFLP patterns by [13]. Further study is clearly needed to confirm this relationship.
Unfortunately, the select agent status of P. philipinnensis
has made the obtaining of additional samples, even of
DNA, impossible to date.

Conclusion
Microsatellite primer sets developed from P. sorghi
sequences proved to be useful for all downy mildew species analyzed and are likely to be increasingly developed

and applied to studies of pathogen epidemiology, population biology, and genomics. The diversity of microsatellite motifs gave each species a unique "signature" of repeat
distributions. Subsets of the 54 newly developed SSRs
may be very useful for rapid and efficient identification
and genetic analysis of the natural populations and host
range of these obligate oomycetes. The unique banding
pattern of P. philippinensis from fifteen (DM 3, 8, 11, 13,
18, 27, 31, 39, 40, 45, 50, 52, 53, 54, & DM 55) and P.
sparsa from seven (DM13, 23, 24, 45, 48, 50 and DM53)
SSRs make these primers useful as diagnostic markers for
the respective species. In future studies it will be possible
to focus on the population diversity and recombination
within and between native and introduced populations of
the closely related species. These distinct fingerprinting
profiles can be used as diagnostic tools to formulate
breeding strategies targeting host resistance to local pathogen populations and for monitoring the emergence of
new virulent races.
