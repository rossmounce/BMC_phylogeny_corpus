Abstract
Background: Metamorphosis is an important process in the life cycle of holometabolous insects
and is regulated by insect hormones. During metamorphosis, the epidermis goes through a
significant transformation at the biochemical and molecular levels.
Results: To identify proteins and phosphoproteins involved in this process, we separated and
compared epidermal protein profiles between feeding larvae and metamorphically committed
larvae using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Pro-Q Diamond Phosphoprotein Staining.
Sixty-one spots showing differential expression and/or phosphorylation were analyzed by mass
spectrometry and eighteen proteins were proved related to larval-pupal transformation. Eight of
them were further examined at the mRNA level by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain
Reaction (RT-PCR) and two of them were examined at the protein level by Western blot. Calponin
was highly expressed in the metamorphic epidermis and phosphorylated by protein kinase C.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that the expression and phosphorylation of these proteins may
play important roles in coordinating the biochemical processes involved in larval-pupal
metamorphosis.

Background
Metamorphosis, the complete transformation from larva
to pupa and then to adult, is a significant process for
holometabolous insects such as moths and flies. During
metamorphosis larval tissues like midgut, fat body and
integument are histolyzed via a programmed cell death
process and remodeled to adult structures [1]. Insect metamorphosis is known to be controlled by the interplay of
two hormones, juvenile hormone (JH) and 20-hydroxy-

ecdysone (20E). At the end of the final larval stage, the JH
titer decreases and 20E initiates metamorphosis in the
absence of JH [2]. Recently, a set of transcriptional regulators involved in the ecdysone-regulated metamorphosis
cascade has been revealed. For example, broad gene (Br)
plays a key role in the initiation and progression through
metamorphosis, but not in larval molt [1]. During this
process, the phosphorylation state of these proteins is also
closely related to their function. For instance, phosphorPage 1 of 13

ylation mediated by protein kinase C (PKC) can suppress
JH action by preventing nuclear proteins from binding to
JH-responsive promoters [3]. Moreover, PKC-mediated
phosphorylation of ultraspiracle protein (USP) is essential for 20E-induced gene expression in the salivary glands
of Drosophila melanogaster [4]. However, the molecular
mechanism of hormonal regulation of metamorphosis is
still a mystery. Therefore, it is important to identify specifically expressed proteins and their phosphorylation states
in order to understand the biochemistry of metamorphosis.
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) in conjunction with mass spectrometry provides a useful tool for
detection of differentially expressed proteins. Zhang and
his colleagues identified twelve proteins from the skeletal
muscles of the silkworm, Bombyx mori [5] with significantly different expression levels in larvae and pupae. In
the salivary gland of Drosophila, 20E-induced expression
of fourteen proteins required PKC activity [6]. Recently,
the Pro-Q Diamond Phosphoprotein Stain (Molecular
Probes, United States) was found to be a powerful tool for
revealing differentially regulated phosphoproteins and
has been widely used to detect phosphoproteins after separation on 2-DE gels [7-9]. Thus, 2DE-based proteomic
and phosphoproteomic approaches were applied to
understand the molecular mechanisms of larval metamorphosis.
The cotton bollworm,Helicoverpa armigera, is an important agricultural pest worldwide. It is also an ideal model
for studying the molting and metamorphosis of Lepidopteran insects because of its relatively large body size, fast
development, and easy cultivation in the laboratory. Pauchet et al. reported the midgut lumen proteome of H.
armigera feeding larvae and identified not only digestive
enzymes but also arginine kinase and pathogen recognition proteins [10]. To identify the molting- and metamorphosis-related proteins and genes, we have reported a set
of genes that are differentially expressed during molting
and metamorphosis [11]. Thirty differentially expressed
proteins, including enzymes, regulators, protein hydrolases and receptors, have been detected in the epidermis,
fat body and hemolymph of H. armigera during larval
molting [12]. The purpose of this study is to further identify the differentially expressed and phosphorylated proteins in the epidermis of H. armigera during larval-pupal
metamorphosis.

Results
Mapping differentially expressed and phosphorylated
proteins
Because the larva-pupa transition takes approximately 4
days, in order to identify as many metamorphically
expressed proteins as possible, we combined the samples

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/600

of metamorphosis (6th-M) epidermis from five time
points during metamorphosis (see Materials and Methods). The 5th feeding larvae (5th-F) were selected as controls to compare the protein profiles between the
metamorphosis and feeding samples. Instead of normalization of gels, the spots were compared by ratio (spot
quantity/total spots quantity). Figure 1 showed the differentially expressed and phosphorylated proteins during
metamorphosis.
The protein spots that were up-regulated on protein levels
and/or had variation of phosphorylation in the 6th-M epidermis sample when compared with that of the 5th-F were
selected for further identification by PMF (protein mass
figerprint) and MS/MS spectra (Figure 1). These spots can
be divided into three groups. The proteins in the first
group had increased expression but were not phosphorylated because no signal was detected in the Pro-Q stained
gels, including spots 1-34 (Figure 2A). In the second
group, the increased expression of the proteins was
accompanied by induced phosphorylation, including
spots, 35-57 (Figure 2B). In the third group, the expression of the proteins was maintained at the same level, but
their phosphorylation state changed, including spots 5861, with a lower phosphorylation signal for spots 58, 59,
and 60, but a higher signal for spot 61 in the 6th-M gel
(Figure 2C, D).
Identification of proteins by PMF and MS/MS spectra
In order to maximize protein identification, the NCBI
nr_Metazoa Database was selected. Protein scores greater
than 74 were considered statistically significant (p < 0.05)
when using PMF spectra. In this way, sixteen spots were
identified. When using MS/MS spectra, protein scores
greater than 45 were statistically significant; five proteins
were confirmed using this approach. In addition, 2 spots
that were not identified by PMF data were identified using
MS/MS spectra data. Because of the lack of information on
H. armigera proteins, among the sixty-one spots analyzed
by mass spectrometry only eighteen spots were identified
by Mascot searches. Most of the proteins were identified
according to protein sequences from other insects such as
D. melanogaster and B. mori. Hexamerin (Spot 27, 28, 29)
was the only one identified through H. armigera (Table 1).
The other spots gave PMF and MS/MS spectra but Mascot
searches did not produce significant match results.

Most of the experimental MWs and pIs of the identified
proteins are consistent with their theoretical values, but
the MWs and pIs of a few proteins including spots 36, 37,
40, 44, 45 and 50 in the gel varied, presumably due to
post-translational modification. Phosphorylation may
increase the experimental MW and shift the protein to a
more acidic pI, as for heat shock protein (HSP1) (spot 40,
61) and solute carrier family 25 (spot 45). Moreover, the

spots visualized by different staining methods. The experiments were replicated three times.

MW difference between protein homologues should also
be taken into consideration since the majority of proteins
were identified based on protein sequence information
from other species. For example, the theoretical MW of
aldehyde dehydrogenase from Bombyx mori is 53 kDa
which is different from the approximately 70 kDa experimental MW of aldehyde dehydrogenase in H. armigera.

Nevertheless, further verification is needed for this protein.
In the identified proteins, hexamerin (spot 27, 28, 29)
and HSP1 (spot 40, 61) appeared more than once. The
spots of hexamerin were very close to each other in the
gels, so they might result from different isoforms or other

post-translational modifications. However, the MWs of
the two HSP1s (spot 40 and spot 61) were different so it
is possible that they are different HSPs.
Analysis of identified proteins on the gene transcription
level
According to a previous study on the developmental
stages of H. armigera [13], Helicoverpa larval metamorphosis begins about 72 h after larvae enter their last instar.
Therefore, total RNA for RT-PCR analysis was extracted
from the feeding 5th instar larvae (5th-F, 5th-24 h), the
feeding 6th instar larvae (6th-F, 6th-24 h, 6th-48 h) and
metamorphically committed larvae (6th-M, 6th-72 h, 6th96 h, 6th-108 h).

Eight genes encoding the identified proteins described
above in Table 2 were analyzed. The results showed that
hexamerin, calponin, 60 S acidic ribosomal protein P0,
arylphorin subunit and aldehyde dehydrogenase
appeared increased transcriptional expression during metamorphosis, which were consistent with the result of 2-DE
(Figure 3).
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF 4A)
showed an increase in transcription at the 6th-24 and 6th48 h feeding stages but no significant variation after metamorphic commitment when larvae entered 6th-72 h. Similarly, the ATP synthase beta subunit did not show a
significant increase during metamorphosis (Figure 3).
These were consistent with the results of 2-DE, where they
had the same expression levels between 5th-24 h and metamorphosis but with decreased phosphorylation levels
during metamorphosis (Figure 2C). These two proteins
might participate in metamorphosis by a regulated
decrease in their phosphorylation levels but not in mRNA
transcription levels.
The proteasome alpha 3 subunit transcription levels
showed a typical increase in mRNA levels during metamorphosis, which was not correlated to the 2-DE result of
constant protein level (Figure 3). The reason for this lack

of correlation might be post-transcriptional regulation or
increased protein turnover.
Analysis of identified proteins on the translation level
Western blotting was used to confirm expression levels of
differentially expressed proteins identified by the proteomic approach. Because the antibodies against H. armigera proteins were not commercially available, only two
identified proteins, calponin (Cal) and hexamerin (Hex)
were adopted for analysis in the epidermis of the 5th-F,
6th-F and 6th-M larvae. Consistent with the 2-DE results,
calponin and hexamerin both showed an increase at 6th72 h, 6th-96 h and 6th-120 h during metamorphosis (Figure 4A). These results suggested that both genes were upregulated by 20E in vivo during metamorphosis.

To test this hypothesis, the 6th instar feeding larvae were
injected with 20E and protein samples were extracted.
Western blot analysis showed that both calponin and hexamerin underwent a remarkable enhancement in their
expression levels after 20E injection compared to the
DMSO control. These results indicate that 20E up-regulated the expression of calponin and hexamerin during
metamorphosis of the cotton bollworm (Figure 4B).
As shown in Fig. 4B, calponin exhibited two bands with
slightly different molecular sizes when stimulated by 20E.
Since Helicoverpa calponin does not have signal peptides
and is unlikely to be exposed to the N-glycosylation
machinery for glycosylation http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/serv
ices/NetNGlyc/, the upper band is most likely the phosphorylated form of calponin. To test this hypothesis, the
protein sample was treated with λ phosphatase. λ phosphatase treatment decreased the upper band signal and
enhanced the lower band signal, confirming that the
upper band is a phosphorylated form of calponin (Figure
4C). Protein kinase consensus recognition sequence analysis revealed that calponin contains a Protein kinase C
(PKC) phosphorylation site at amino acid residue Thr183
with score 0.78 http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/Net
PhosK/. This prompted us to test whether PKC is involved

in the phosphorylation of calponin. When the PKC specific inhibitor (chelerythrine chloride, CC) was injected
into the larvae together with 20E, the upper band disappeared (Figure 4C) and the lower band immunoreactivity
doubled, indicating that PKC is responsible for calponin
phosphorylation.
Investigating the pertinence of calponin to metamorphosis
To examine the pertinence of calponin to metamorphosis,
we examined the expression profiles of calponin and
Broad (Br), an initiating factor of metamorphosis. Results
showed that the mRNA of calponin in the epidermis
increased when larvae entered metamorphosis from 6th72 h to pupae, which was correlated to the expression profile of Br. In addition, both calponin and Br were able to
be induced after 20E was injected into the 6th-6h larva for
24 hours (Figure 5).

Discussion
Calponin is an actin-binding protein that inhibits actomyosin ATPase activity [14]. In human muscle, calponin can
directly activate PKC autophosphorylation that increases
PKC activity [15]. Since PKC is required for 20E-induced
gene expression and can block JH action [3,6,16], we
hypothesized that up-regulation of calponin during the
larval-pupal metamorphosis may facilitate 20E action by
activating PKC. Interestingly, calponin can also be phosphorylated by PKC [17], but its phosphorylation signal in
the present study was weak in 2-DE gels during the larvalpupal metamorphosis. The low phosphorylation signal
might be due to a single putative PKC phosphorylation
site as revealed by the protein kinase consensus recognition sequence analysis described above. Nevertheless, we
detected the phosphorylation of calponin by Western blot
and demonstrated that 20E increases calponin phosphorylation via PKC.
The mRNA of calponin and Br in epidermis of H. armigera
exhibited similar expression profiles. They both vastly
accumulated during metamorphosis. Both calponin and
Br can be induced by 20E when 6th feeding larvae were
injected with 20E for different time periods. This induction seemed to be distinguishing. Induction of Br mRNA
by 20E was earlier than that of calponin. These validated
the story that Br initiates metamorphosis. Furthermore,
calponin is demonstrated to be possibly involved in larval-pupal metamorphosis of H. armigera.
Helicoverpa calponin shares 70% identity with Apis Chd64
and 67% identity with Drosophila Chd64. Li et al. [18] presented a model of the signal transduction pathway for the
JH-regulated genes, in which Chd64 is a chaperone protein that regulates gene expression in the 20E and JH signal transduction pathway. They indicated that in the
presence of high JH and 20E levels (larval molting stage)

the mRNAs of FKBP39 (39-kDa FK506-binding protein)
and Chd64 (21-kDa calponin-like protein) are induced,
interact with EcR (ecdysone receptor), USP and Met, and
bind to the DmJHRE1 (D. melanogaster JH response element 1) sequence. This could result in the increase in the
expression of DmJHRE1-containing genes and reduction
in the expression of ecdysone response genes due to a
decrease in the availability of EcR and USP. When 20E
increases in the absence of JH (metamorphosis), the
FKBP39 and Chd64 levels are low. Under this circumstance, EcR heterodimerizes with other members of the
nuclear receptor superfamily, especially with USP, thus
inducing the expression of ecdysone response genes.
However, our results show that calponin was up regulated
during metamorphosis and 20E increased the expression
of calponin. This discrepancy may be due to the differences among species or the differences among proteins.
Because Chd64 has been shown to interact with 16 proteins http://www.thebiogrid.org/SearchResults/summary/
63970, the exact function of calponin in metamorphosis

Developmental profiles and hormone induction of calponin and Br in epidermis
Developmental profiles and hormone induction of calponin and Br in epidermis. (A) Expression changes of both
genes. 5-24 h, 5-36 h, 6-0 h, 6-24 h, 6-48 h, 6-72 h, 6-96 h, 6-120 h, P-0 day denote mRNA samples from different developmental stages from 5th-instar 24 hour to pupae. (B) 20E induction. 6th-6 h larvae were injected with 20E (500 ng/larva) for 1 h, 3 h,
6 h, 12 h and 24 h, DMSO injection as a control.

Hexamerins usually consist of six approximately 80 kDa
subunits, giving rise to a native molecule of about 500
kDa [19]. Hexamerins containing a high concentration of
aromatic amino acids are called arylphorins [20]. They are
synthesized and reach extraordinary concentrations just
before metamorphosis [19]. Although hexamerins are
thought to act mainly as storage proteins, they have also
been identified as constituents of the sclerotizing system
[21], which plays a key role in pupal cuticle formation.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that insect prophenoloxidases were also members of hexamerin family, and played
a role in sclerotization of the cuticle and encapsulation of

foreign particles [22]. Zhou also hypothesized that hexamerins limited the impacts of JH on termite caste
polyphenism by modulating JH availability [23]. By subtractive hybridization, Dong et al. pointed out that hexamerin was also up-regulated at the transcriptional level
in the epidermis of H. armigera during metamorphosis
[11].
A viral-like chitinase was also found to be up-regulated.
The degradation of cuticular chitin by chitinases is a vital
step prior to ecdysis and metamorphosis [24]. Kramer et
al. [25] reported that the chitinase gene of Manduca sexta

Page 9 of 13

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:600

was most highly expressed in epidermal and gut tissues
during the larval-pupal metamorphosis and its transcription was stimulated by 20E and inhibited by a JH mimic.
The chitinase might be involved in remodeling of the
integument during metamorphosis.
Proteasome alpha 3 subunit is a member of the 20S proteasome, which is ATP-independent and has several distinct catalytic activities involved in the ubiquitinproteasome system [26,27]. Phosphorylation can control
the import of proteasomes into the nucleus [28]. The proteasome subunit alpha type 5 was found up-regulated in
fat bodies of H. armigera during larval molting [12]. The
up-regulation of proteasome alpha 3 subunit suggested
the participation of proteasomes in tissue remodeling
during larval molting and metamorphosis.
Some of the differentially expressed proteins identified in
the metamorphic larval epidermis in the present study,
such as ATP synthase, proteasome subunit and translation
initiation factor 4A, are similar to those found in the molting larval epidermis in our previous study [12]. Interestingly, ATP synthase beta subunit and eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 4A, which were induced by
20E and inhibited by the PKC specific inhibitor chelerythrine chloride (CC) in Drosophila salivary glands [6], are
also phosphoproteins in the metamorphosis epidermis in
our study, suggesting that they might play important roles
in the 20E signal transduction pathway during metamorphosis.

Conclusion
The results suggest that the up-regulation and/or changes
in the phosphorylation levels of proteins are involved in
the larval-pupal metamorphosis. Hexamerin was highly
expressed in the epidermis during metamorphosis. In
addition, calponin was highly expressed in the metamorphic epidermis and phosphorylated by protein kinase C,
which suggesting it plays an important role in metamorphosis.

Methods
Experimental animals
Larvae of the cotton bollworm (H. armigera) were reared
on an artificial diet described (made from powder of
wheat germs and soybeans with various vitamins as well
as inorganic salts) by Zhao et al. [29] at 28°C with 6070% relative humidity in our laboratory. The light:dark
schedule was 14:10 h.
Preparation of protein samples
For 2-DE analysis, we used samples from fifth-instar feeding larvae (5th-F) and sixth-instar metamorphically committed larvae (6th-M). The 5th-F larvae were defined as
the larvae that had shed their old fourth instar cuticle and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/600

had grown for 24 h. The 6th-M larvae were defined as the
larvae at 72 h, 84 h, 96 h, 108 h, and 120 h after molting
into the 6th instar.
The epidermis was dissected from the 5th-F larvae or the
6th-M larvae at the indicated time points, homogenized
by glass homogenizer in 1 ml sample buffer [40 mM Tris,
3 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride],
and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm (24,300 g) for 10 min at
4°C. The supernatants were passed through 0.45 μm
microporous filters (Xing Ya, Shanghai, China). Total proteins in the samples were determined by the Bradford
method 30. The metamorphosis sample was a mixture of
1 mg protein sample from each of the five stages of the
sixth instar larvae described above.
Each protein was precipitated with two volumes of acetone containing 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 20
mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at -20°C for 2 h. After being centrifuged at 12,000 rpm (24,300 g) for 15 min, the precipitate was washed twice with two volumes of pre-cooled
acetone containing 20 mM DTT for 15 min and centrifuged to collect the proteins. The proteins were then dried
at room temperature.d
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE)
The dried protein samples were redissolved in a rehydration solution containing 8 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% 3[(3-Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]propanesulfonic acid, 65 mM DTT and 0.2% (w/v) Ampholyte pH
3.0-10.0 (GE Healthcare, United States). Eight hundred
micrograms of protein were loaded on an 18-cm nonlinear Immobiline IPG Drystrip (pH 3-10) (GE Healthcare)
in a rehydration tray for 14 h. An Ettan IPGphor3 system
(GE Healthcare) was used for the first-dimensional isoelectric focusing (IEF) at 250 V for 1 h, 500 V for 1 h, 1,000
V for 5 h, followed by linearly ramping to 10,000 V over 3
h and then holding at 10,000 V until 60,000 V-h had been
accumulated. After IEF, the IPG strip was first equilibrated
with an equilibration buffer (0.375 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6
M urea, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS) containing 65 mM DTT
for 10 min followed by 135 mM iodoacetamide for 10
min with constant shaking. After equilibration of the
focused IPG strip, the strip was transferred to the top of a
12% SDS polyacrylamide gel and sealed with 1% low
melting agarose. The second-dimensional electrophoresis
was performed on a Protean II xi system (Bio-Rad) at 10
mA per gel for 30 min, and then 25 mA for approximately
6 h. Three independent repeats were performed. The
detailed protocol for 2-DE is described in the instruction
manual from GE Healthcare.
Protein staining and imaging
After electrophoresis, the gels were first stained with the
Pro-Q Diamond Phosphoprotein Stain (Molecular

Page 10 of 13

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:600

Probes, United States) following the manufacturer's
instructions. Briefly, the gels were fixed with 50% (v/v)
methanol and 10% (v/v) acetic acid for 60 min twice.
After washed with ultrapure water, the gels were incubated
in the dark in Pro-Q Diamond Phosphoprotein Stain with
gentle agitation for 1.5-2 h. The gels were destained with
a destaining solution [20% (v/v) acetonitrile, 50 mM
sodium acetate, pH 4.0] 3 times, 30 min each. The gels
were imaged with a Typhoon Trio+ System (GE Healthcare, United States) and the images were optimized using
phosphoprotein molecular weight standards (Invitrogen,
United States). Then the gels were stained with colloidal
Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 [10% (w/v) ammonium
sulfate, 1% (w/w) phosphoric acid, 0.1% Coomassie Blue
G-250] and destained with ultrapure water. The gel
images were analyzed using ImageMaster 2D Platinum
6.0 software (GE Healthcare) to identify differentially
expressed and phosphorylated proteins.
In-gel digestion
The differentially expressed and phosphorylated protein
spots were manually picked from the gel and placed individually into methanol-treated tubes. Each gel piece was
washed 3 times with distilled water. Then 200 μL of 200
mM ammonium bicarbonate with 40% acetonitrile was
added to each tube and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes.
After that, the solution was removed from the tube. The
gel piece in each tube was suspended in 100 μL acetonitrile and dehydrated for 5 min before the excess acetonitrile was discarded. The gel piece was dried in vacuum
for 15 min and then treated with 5 μL of a trypsin solution
[20 μg/mL trypsin (Proteomics Grade, Sigma, United
States), 40 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 9% acetonitrile].
The tube was incubated on ice for 45 min and then excess
trypsin solution was removed. To cover the gel piece, 5 μL
of 40 mM ammonium bicarbonate in a 9% acetonitrile
solution was added and incubated overnight at 37°C.
After the incubation, the liquid from the gel piece was
transferred to a new labeled tube. Then 5 μL of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in a 50% acetonitrile solution was added
to the gel piece and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. After
that, the solution was collected and combined with the
liquid from the previous step. The combined sample solution was used for MALDI-TOF-MS (matrix assisted laser
desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry)
analysis.
MALDI-TOF-MS and MS/MS analysis
The trypsin-digested peptides were mixed with a MALDI
matrix [7 mg/mL α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 0.1%
trifluoroacetic acid and 50% acetonitrile] and spotted on
the MALDI target plates. MS and MS/MS spectra were
obtained with an ABI 4700 MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, United States) operating in
a result-dependent acquisition mode. Peptide mass maps

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/600

were acquired in a reflectron mode (1000 V accelerating
voltage) with 1,000 laser shots per spectrum. Six external
standards (mass standard kit for the 4700 Proteomics
Analyzer calibration mixture, Part Number 4333604,
Applied Biosystems) were used to calibrate each spectrum
to a mass accuracy within 50 ppm. The MS/MS data were
acquired with stop conditions and 3,000-6,000 laser shots
were accumulated for each spectrum (Additional files 1).
MS/MS analysis were performed at collision energy of 1
kV and the collision gas pressure of 2.0 × 10-7 to 3 × 10-8
Torr.
The MASCOT search engine (version 1.9, Matrix Science,
http://www.matrixscience.com/search_form_select.html)
was used to search all of the tandem mass spectra against
NCBInr_Metazoa Database. Carbamidomethyl (C)
(cysteine carbamidomethylation) and Oxidation (M)
(methionine oxidation) were selected as fixed and variable modifications. One missing trypsin cleavage was
allowed. Peptide mass tolerance and fragment mass tolerance were set to 100 ppm or 0.6 Da. High confidence
identifications had statistically significant search scores
(greater than 95% confidence, equivalent to MASCOT
expect value p < 0.05), were consistent with the protein's
experimental pI and MW, and accounted for the majority
of ions present in the mass spectra.
Reverse Transcription PCR
Total RNA was isolated from the epidermis of the 5th-F,
6th-F and 6th-M larvae. In 20E-induction experiment,
total RNA was extracted from epidermis of larvae injected
with 20E for different time periods. Five micrograms of
RNA was used to reverse transcribe the first strand cDNA
(First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit, Sangon, China), which
was then used as a template (0.5 ng) in PCR reactions with
gene-specific primers. Specific PCR primers for the genes
of the proteins identified in MALDI-TOF-MS were
designed from expression sequence tags of H. armigera
(Table 2). PCR cycles were as follows: one cycle (94°C, 2
min); 27 cycles (94°C, 30 s; 55°C, 40 s; 72°C, 30 s), followed by a last cycle (72°C, 10 min). A β-actin gene fragment from H. armigera was also amplified as a control.
Each RT-PCR assay was replicated three times.
Western blotting
To confirm expression changes for some of the interesting
proteins identified, the epidermis of fifth feeding larvae
(5th-F), sixth feeding larvae (6th-F) and sixth-metamorphically committed larvae (6th-M) were dissected and
homogenized for Western blotting. The protein extracted
from each tissue was quantified by the Bradford method.
Equal amounts of protein (50 μg) were subjected to
12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (SDSPAGE) and then electro-transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes. The membranes were incubated in a block-

ing buffer (10 mM Tris-buffered saline) containing 2%
milk power at room temperature for 1 h, then incubated
with primary antibodies: diluted 1:100 for anti-calponin
polyclonal antibodies (generated in our lab) and 1:500
for anti-hexamerin monoclonal antibody (a gift from Dr.
Gang Ma, University of Adelaide, Australia) at 4°C overnight, respectively. Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) diluted 1:10000 was
adopted as a secondary antibody. 4-chloro-1-naphthol
was used as a HRP substrate for visualizing the peroxidase
activity. The quantity of protein loaded was controlled by
SDS-PAGE with two gels simultaneously, one for transferring and the other for Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining.
Induction with 20E was performed as follows. A 10 mg/
mL stock solution of 20E in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
was diluted 1:100 in PBS (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10
mM Na2HPO4 and 1.8 mM KH2PO4). The 6th instar feeding larvae (6th-6 h, 6th-12 h, 6th-24 h and 6th-48 h) were
each injected with 500 ng 20E in 5 μl of the dilution, and
then incubated for 12 h. An equal volume of DMSO
diluted in PBS was injected into control larvae.
To verify the identified phosphoprotein, λ protein phosphatase (λPPase) was added to the epidermis homogenate of 20E-injected larvae at a final concentration of 4
μg/100 μl reaction buffer [500 mM Hepes (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-ethane-sulphonicacid), pH 7.5, 1 mM
EDTA, and 20 mM MnCl2] and incubated at 37°C for 10
min before subjected to Western blot analysis. To reveal
whether phosphorylation of the identified protein was
regulated by protein kinase C (PKC), a PKC specific inhibitor, CC (chelerythrine chloride), was injected into the larvae together with 20E. The epidermis proteins of each
sample were extracted 12 h after injection and subjected
to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.
