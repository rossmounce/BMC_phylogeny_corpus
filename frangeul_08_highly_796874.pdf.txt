Abstract
Background: The colonial cyanobacterium Microcystis proliferates in a wide range of freshwater
ecosystems and is exposed to changing environmental factors during its life cycle. Microcystis
blooms are often toxic, potentially fatal to animals and humans, and may cause environmental
problems. There has been little investigation of the genomics of these cyanobacteria.
Results: Deciphering the 5,172,804 bp sequence of Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 has revealed
the high plasticity of its genome: 11.7% DNA repeats containing more than 1,000 bases, 6.8%
putative transposases and 21 putative restriction enzymes. Compared to the genomes of other
cyanobacterial lineages, strain PCC 7806 contains a large number of atypical genes that may have
been acquired by lateral transfers. Metabolic pathways, such as fermentation and a methionine
salvage pathway, have been identified, as have genes for programmed cell death that may be related
to the rapid disappearance of Microcystis blooms in nature. Analysis of the PCC 7806 genome also
reveals striking novel biosynthetic features that might help to elucidate the ecological impact of
secondary metabolites and lead to the discovery of novel metabolites for new biotechnological

applications. M. aeruginosa and other large cyanobacterial genomes exhibit a rapid loss of synteny
in contrast to other microbial genomes.
Conclusion: Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 appears to have adopted an evolutionary strategy
relying on unusual genome plasticity to adapt to eutrophic freshwater ecosystems, a property
shared by another strain of M. aeruginosa (NIES-843). Comparisons of the genomes of PCC 7806
and other cyanobacterial strains indicate that a similar strategy may have also been used by the
marine strain Crocosphaera watsonii WH8501 to adapt to other ecological niches, such as
oligotrophic open oceans.

Background
Dated approximately 3 billion years old by fossil records,
cyanobacteria were the first oxyphototrophic prokaryotes
present on Earth [1]. As architects of the Earth's atmosphere they had a major impact on the evolution of aerobic
metabolism and the evolution of life [2]. Cyanobacteria
still play a fundamental role in the functioning of global
ecosystems by significantly contributing to carbon fluxes
[3,4] and by providing nitrogen used for primary production [5]. On the other hand, cyanobacterial blooms may
lead to a loss of biodiversity in the phytoplanktonic communities and, by generating very high quantities of
organic matter used by anoxygenic bacteria in the bottom
layers of water resources, can cause massive death of fish
by asphyxia [6]. The financial costs resulting from cyanobacterial proliferations are considerable (e.g. 200 million
Australian dollars/year in Australia) [7].
Freshwater cyanobacteria of the genus Microcystis are distributed worldwide, and are involved in numerous proliferation events in stratified lakes [8]. In their natural
environment, Microcystis cells are organized in large colonies of various sizes and shapes, which were used to
define various morphospecies. Five of these have recently
been reunified as a single species, Microcystis aeruginosa
[9]. The determinism of the morphogical variations
within this polymorphic cyanobacterial species is currently under debate.
The ecology of M. aeruginosa is characterized by an annual
life cycle comprising a spring and summer pelagic phase,
and an overwintering benthic phase [10]. During the
pelagic phase, M. aeruginosa colonies migrate daily in the
water column [11] and may accumulate to form blooms
or scums on the surface of the water. Thus, on a daily
basis, as well as during the benthic and pelagic phases,
colonies are exposed to changing environmental conditions of light, temperature and oxygen concentrations.
In the last decade, cyanobacterial blooms have been
involved in numerous cases of animal [12] and human
[13] poisonings, mainly due to the ability of Microcystis
cells to synthesize toxins, in particular variants of microcystin [14]. Many other oligopeptides, such as cyanopep-

tolins, aeruginosins, microginins, microviridins and
cyclamides may also be produced [15]. Other peptides
and congeners doubtless remain to be discovered, as do
their respective biosynthesis pathways.
To gain further insight into the ecophysiology of Microcystis aeruginosa, we deciphered the genome sequence of
the toxic strain PCC 7806. The results presented here associate descriptive genomics and comparisons with the
genomes of other cyanobacteria isolated from freshwater
and marine ecosystems to highlight the ecophysiological
peculiarities of this strain, and put its particularly high
genome plasticity into a cyanobacterial context.

Results and discussion
General features of the M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 genome
The 12× shotgun sequencing project produced 90,000
sequence reads, and their assembly resulted in more than
500 contigs. After the first steps of a long finishing process
performed using CAAT-Box [16] and Consed [17] software, the number of contigs was reduced to 328 (N50 =
100kb), 116 of which were more than 3,000 bases in
length (up to 533,374 bases). The genome contains an
unusually high number of long DNA repeats. Most of the
extremities of these contigs consist of DNA repeated
sequences including gene coding for transposases (see
below). The 116 contigs were deposited in the EMBL database (AM778843–AM778958). The genome sequence of
M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 (Mic-PCC7806), represented by
these contigs, consists of 5,172,804 bases, with an average
G+C content of 42%. These values are consistent with
those previously determined using thermally denatured
DNA [18]. The contigs were annotated using CAAT-Box
software and a total of 5,292 predicted protein-coding
sequences (CDSs) were validated manually. These CDSs
were compared to several protein (Uniprot, COG and 45
cyanobacterial proteomes) and motif databases (Prosite
and Pfam).

All the genomes used for the comparative studies
described below are listed in the Methods section.

Comparison with other cyanobacterial genomes
A concatenated dataset of large and small subunit rRNA
sequences (23S and 16S rRNA) was used to construct a
phylogenetic tree including Mic-PCC7806 and 37 other
cyanobacterial strains (Figure 1). The tree is congruent
with previously published ones based on 16S rRNA
sequences [19,20], but shows higher statistical support at
most nodes (especially internal ones), probably due to the
larger number of positions used. The strains of the genus
Microcystis form a well-supported group (BV of 853‰)
with Synechocystis sp. (Syn-PCC6803), Crocosphaera watsonii (Cwa-WH8501) and Cyanothece sp. (Cth-CCY0110
and Cth-ATCC51142). Within this group, Microcystis is
most closely related to Syn-PCC6803 (BV of 990‰).

The Mic-PCC7806 genome was compared to the recently
publicly available genome of Microcystis aeruginosa strain
NIES-843 (Mic-NIES843) [21]. Although the average similarity between the orthologous genes is 94%, their comparison emphasizes that the two genomes largely differ
both in length and gene composition (Table 1). Indeed,
the Mic-NIES843 genome is 0.6 Mb longer than that of
Mic-PCC7806. Moreover, the two genomes display a high
number of strain-specific genes (838 for Mic-PCC7806
and 1760 for Mic-NIES843). Interestingly, most of these
genes are absent from 44 other cyanobacterial complete
genomes suggesting that they have recently been acquired
in each of the two Microcystis strains independently.
Although the two genomes contain the same proportions
of large DNA repeats (~12%, see below), their distribution and size partly differ since Mic-PCC7806 contains 48
repeats longer than 3,000 bases for only 11 in MicNIES843. The comparison of the location of similar genes
in the largest contig of the Mic-PCC7806 assembly
(contig328) and in the Mic-NIES843 genome shows
numerous genomic rearrangements (see Additional file
1). These rearrangements, probably facilitated by the presence of large repeats, render the Mic-NIES843 genome of
little help for the finishing of the assembly process of the
Mic-PCC7806 genome sequence.
The 5292 CDSs of the Mic-PCC7806 genome were also
compared to the proteomes of 44 strains representing the
diversity of the cyanobacterial lineages (all publicly available genomes excluding Mic-NIES843). The distribution
of the best High Scoring Pairs (HSPs) found using Blastall
software indicates a high similarity between the proteome
of Mic-PCC7806 and a group of three strains CthATCC51142, Cth-CCY0110 and Cwa-WH8501 (Table 2).
This is puzzling, since Mic-PCC7806 is closer to SynPCC6803 than to this group in the 23S-16S phylogeny
(Figure 1). In order to exclude possible bias introduced by
uneven distribution of CDSs in these genomes, we analyzed only the orthologs shared by three of these
genomes, Mic-PCC7806, Syn-PCC6803 and Cwa-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/274

WH8501. Based on BiDirectional Best Hit (BDBH) analyses, 1789 CDSs of the Mic-PCC7806 genome were found
to correspond to putative orthologs in Cwa-WH8501 and
Syn-PCC6803. The mean Blast score of these CDSs was
381 for the comparison between Mic-PCC7806 and CwaWH8501, and only 366 for Mic-PCC7806 versus SynPCC6803. The distribution curve of all the Blast scores
(see Additional file 2) showed that the Mic-PCC7806
genome was more closely related to Cwa-WH8501 than to
Syn-PCC6803 for all score values considered. The absence
of congruence between the results obtained with rDNA
sequences and the core proteins means that additional
data sets for other members of these three cyanobacterial
genera are required. Nevertheless, the results obtained by
comparing all the orthologous genes shared by MicPCC7806 (freshwater strain) and Cwa-WH8501 (marine
strain) are consistent with the fact that freshwater and
marine cyanobacteria are interspersed in global 16S rDNA
phylogenetic trees [20].
Three distinct groups of proteins were identified on the
basis of Blastp analyses of the 5,292 CDSs of MicPCC7806, with a selection of 15 other cyanobacterial
genomes displaying at least 1% of best Blastp hits with
Mic-PCC7806 (Table 2). The composition of these groups
largely depends on the threshold chosen to consider that
two proteins are similar. Without an obvious breakpoint
in the distribution of protein similarities between different genomes (see Additional file 2), we arbitrarily chose a
threshold of 40% of similarity, considering that below
this value two proteins do not share the same function.
The three groups are as follows:
- The "maeru40" group included 764 CDSs (14.4%) specific to the Mic-PCC7806 genome and not found in the 15
selected genomes; 438 (8.3%) of them have no homolog
in the uniprot database;
- The "core40" group comprised 652 proteins (12.3%)
sharing significant Blastp scores with at least one CDS in
each of the 15 other genomes tested;
- The last group, designated "other40", consisted of 3,876
CDSs (73%) sharing significant Blastp scores with CDSs
in only some of the other 15 genomes tested.
The small percentage of CDSs in the core40 group reflects
the wide diversity of the cyanobacterial genomes analyzed. In the other40 group, the distribution of the MicPCC7806 CDSs among the tested genomes matches their
phylogenetic distances based on 23S-16S rDNA
sequences. For example, in this group, 10% of the CDSs
were present in all the genomes, apart from that of GviPCC7421, which is the most distant phylogenetically (Figure 1). Moreover, the four closest genomes to Mic-

Mic-PCC7806.

The Mic-PCC7806 genome includes a very large number
of DNA sequences containing more than 1000 bases that
are repeated at least twice in the genome with more than
90% identity. A comparative analysis of all the cyanobacterial genome sequences available in databases showed

particularly rich in such DNA repeats. Indeed, they
account for 11.7%, 11.7% and 19.8% of the total DNA
length, respectively (Figure 2). The cumulative size of the
DNA repeated sequences is not strictly a function of
genome length as Mic-PCC7806 and Cwa-WH8501
genomes have the highest percentage of DNA repeats, but
are of intermediate size relative to the other cyanobacterial genomes (see Additional file 3). In the Mic-PCC7806
genome, 1346 CDSs (25%) are located within these DNA
repeats. Among these CDSs, only 256 and 92 belong to
the maeru40 and core40 groups, respectively. Most of the
CDSs of the core40 group correspond to orthologs that
are not located within DNA repeats in other cyanobacterial genomes. This implies that over the course of evolution, resident genes were probably captured by genetic
mobile elements. A large number of CDSs (362) are very
similar to transposases from the COG database, and 93%
of them are located within long DNA repeated sequences.
At least 46 transposases correspond to ISMae1A/2/3/4 that
had previously been characterized in strain PCC7806
[22], but a large majority of the other transposases cannot
be clearly associated with any known insertion sequence
(only 17 are associated to IS30, 7 to IS1 and 3 to IS5). The
genome of Cwa-WH8501 also contains numerous putative transposases. One third of them are associated to IS5,
but none to IS30; the DNA repeated sequences are therefore different in each genome, and cannot account for the
close phylogenetic relationship between these two strains.
Synteny of cyanobacterial genomes
Although Mic-PCC7806 and Mic-NIES843 are very closely
related strains (Figure 1), their genomes contain a high
number of rearrangements. Moreover, an unexpectedly
low level of synteny was also observed between the Microcystis strains and two close relatives, Cwa-WH8501 and
Syn-PCC6803 (68% mean CDS similarity). Since the
same observation was made for all the cyanobacterial
genomes tested, we compared the dynamics of these

genomes using a large set of other bacterial genomes chosen on the basis of their sizes and phylogenetic distances.
To this end, a synteny score was calculated for a number
of genome pairs (see Methods), and then compared to
their evolutionary distance based on the 23S-16S rDNA
tree. This analysis showed that the synteny scores for
cyanobacterial genomes were significantly lower than
those obtained for pairs of non-cyanobacterial genomes
with similar genome lengths and 23S-16S phylogenetic
distances (Figure 3). Similar results were obtained for all
the cyanobacterial genomes tested. This means that the
low synteny scores observed cannot be related to the long
DNA repeated sequences, which occur only in the MicPCC7806 and Cwa-WH8501 genomes. These results are
in agreement with those of Fang et al. [23], who showed
that both persistent and rare genes are significantly clustered in most of the 169 bacterial genomes analyzed.
However, in a minority subset of bacterial genomes that
includes the cyanobacteria, persistent genes were found to
be fairly uniformly distributed throughout the genome.
Interestingly, only 8 clusters with at least 4 CDSs remain
syntenic in the genomes of Mic-PCC7806, Cwa-WH8501
and Syn-PCC6803. Four of these clusters correspond to
ribosomal proteins. The other clusters are shown in Table

3. Considering the very low level of synteny between
cyanobacterial genomes, it is likely that these specific clusters have been subjected to strong positive selection pressure and may play essential roles in these cyanobacteria.
Some of these clusters are clearly linked to a specific biological function, such as the transport of phosphate (see
Additional file 4) [24], while others consist of conserved
proteins with unknown functions. One can thus speculate
that these proteins may be involved in the same biological
pathway as their close neighbors.
Intergenic regions
Four groups can clearly be identified among the cyanobacterial genomes studied on the basis of their intergenic
distances (Figure 4). The first consists solely of the
genome of Ter-IMS101, which harbors exceptionally long
intergenic regions. To the best of our knowledge, no data
has been published on this genome, which makes it
impossible to rule out the possibility that these regions
result from the poor quality of the sequence or the syntaxic annotation. The second group includes the genome
of Mic-PCC7806 and, among others, those of CwaWH8501 and Syn-PCC6803 which have a high proportion of intergenic sequences around 300 bases long; in the
case of the Mic-PCC7806 genome, less than 35% of inter-

genic sequences are shorter than 100 bases. The third
group comprises the genomes of Syn-PCC7942, Tel-BP1
and Gvi-PCC7421, which have short intergenic regions,
similar in size to those found in a number of other bacterial genomes (see Additional file 5). The fourth group
includes some members of the Prochlorococcus genus that
have very small genomes with short or no intergenic
regions.
The mean length of the intergenic sequences seems to be
linked to the genome size of the cyanobacterium, except
for the genome of Syn-PCC6803, which is smaller (3.6
Mb) than that of Gvi-PCC7421 (4.6 Mb), but harbors
longer intergenic sequences. Although the role of long
intergenic sequences in most cyanobacterial genomes
remains unclear, we can surmise that they might be
involved in the modulation of gene expression, which
would allow cells to acclimate to rapid environmental
changes.

Cluster of atypical genes
In order to explore the plasticity of the Mic-PCC7806
genome further, the number of CDSs with an atypical
dinucleotide composition was determined using a oneorder Markov chain-based methodology [25]. This
method can identify genes that may have been acquired
recently by lateral transfers. In the Mic-PCC7806 genome,
a total of 1971 atypical genes were found, including 1402
within 159 clusters of atypical genes (CAGs) that probably correspond to recently acquired foreign genomic elements (Table 4). As expected, more than 98% of MicPCC7806 genes belonging to the core40 group were not
in CAGs, and 31% of the atypical genes were in the
maeru40 group. Moreover, a high percentage (80%) of
the transposase genes were in CAGs (16% of the genes
present in CAGs encode putative transposases). Compared to seven other cyanobacterial genomes, those of
Mic-PCC7806 and Mic-NIES843 harbor the highest percentages of atypical genes (37%) and CAGs (34% and
36%, respectively). These findings may indicate that the
Microcystis genomes contain a higher proportion of genes

genomes studied.
Putative restriction and modification systems
Blast searches for restriction enzymes and examination of
genes surrounding DNA methylases, identified 21 potential restriction enzymes (see Additional file 6), seven of
which were found to be co-localized with putative methylases (see Additional file 7) in the Mic-PCC7806 genome.
The Mic-NIES843 genome also contains a high number
(at least 17) of putative restriction enzymes [21]. Blast
searches revealed that 14 restriction enzymes are common

to both genomes. In contrast, seven and eight restriction
enzymes seem specific to Mic-PCC7806 and MicNIES843, respectively. The Microcystis aeruginosa strains
might thus constitute a rich source of novel restriction
enzymes potentially useful in biotechnology. According
to Zhao et al. [26], filamentous cyanobacteria (Anabaena,
Spirulina and Nostoc strains) contain more restriction and
modification genes than unicellular cyanobacteria (Synechocystis, Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus strains). Based
on COG annotations, at least as many restriction-modification genes were found in Mic-PCC7806, Mic-NIES843
and Cwa-WH8501 as in filamentous cyanobacteria. Thus,

rather than corresponding to a difference between filamentous and unicellular cyanobacteria, the restrictionmodification gene content of Microcystis aeruginosa may
reflect the potential exposure of the cells to high concentrations of foreign DNA due to the presence of numerous
other bacterial cells or viruses associated with Microcystis
colonies [27]. This exposure to foreign DNA is also consistent with the high number of CAGs putatively acquired
by lateral transfers. Whether such a hypothesis might also
hold true for planktonic cyanobacteria of the genus Crocosphaera remains an open question.
In bacterial genomes containing a high number of genes
for restriction enzymes, short palindromic sequences corresponding to the target sites of these enzymes may be
under-represented [28]. Since the genomes of Microcystis
aeruginosa and Cwa-WH8501 contain a very high number
of putative restriction enzymes, there should be a number
of under-represented short sequences that correspond to
restriction sites. To test this hypothesis, the number of
occurrences of each 6-mer was counted, and a frequency
distribution calculated for Mic-PCC7806, Mic-NIES843,
Cwa-WH8501 and Syn-PCC6803 (Table 5). The underrepresented sites in the three first genomes were not found
in Syn-PCC6803, a genome devoid of restriction enzymes
[29], supporting the idea that these rare 6-mers could
indeed correspond to restriction enzyme sites. In total,
there are 4096 possible 6-mers, 1.5% of which are palindromes. Fifty-one percent of the rarest 1% of 6-mers in the
Mic-PCC7806 genome are palindromes (see Additional
file 8). Palindromes are thus over-represented among the
rarest 6-mers, further supporting the hypothesis that they
could correspond to sites cut by restriction enzymes. The
identity of the rarest 1% of 6-mers in the Mic-PCC7806
genome was compared to known restriction sites in other
organisms as identified by New England Biolabs [30]. We
found that 20 of the 41 sites corresponded to sites cut by
restriction enzymes in other organisms.

A novel DNA modification system was discovered recently
in the Gram-positive bacterium Streptomyces lividans 66
[31]. This system results in the degradation of DNA in vitro
by oxidative, double-stranded, site-specific cleavage during electrophoresis, and is determined by a cluster of five
genes (dndA-B-C-D-E). The dnd gene products incorporate
sulfur into the DNA backbone as a sequence-selective,
stereospecific phosphorothioate modification [32].
According to He et al. [33], the resistance of phosphorothiate linkages to a variety of nuclease activities, and the
site specific nature of such a modification suggest that
phosphorothioates could have a role comparable to that
of DNA methylation in protection against nucleases.
Although the presence of dndB homologs is not clear in
the genomes of cyanobacteria, the rest of the cluster was
found in several of them including Mic-PCC7806 (see
Additional file 9). Despite the low level of synteny in
cyanobacterial genomes (see above), the dndC-D-E genes
are still clustered.
Unraveling genetic features related to the ecophysiology
of M. aeruginosa PCC 7806
Life cycle, colony formation and floatation
During the overwintering benthic phase of their life cycle,
Microcystis colonies withstand long periods of darkness. A
fermentation pathway has been proposed based on biochemical data [34]. All the genes coding for the enzymes
required for the various steps in this pathway have been
identified in the genome sequence (see Additional file
10). During the benthic phase, Microcystis colonies are
exposed to lower temperature and higher pressure. In this
respect, it is interesting to note the presence of a gene
(mic5251) coding for a protein similar to Hik33 that perceives osmotic stress and cold stress in Syn-PCC6803 [35].
Another gene, mic5237, is similar to the Ana-PCC7120
orrA gene whose product is involved in osmoregulation
[36]. A genomic island carrying actM and pfnM, two genes
that encode eukaryotic-like proteins, actin and profilin
(an actin cognate binding partner), respectively, have
been discovered in the Mic-PCC7806 genome. As shown

by Guljamow et al. [37], this eukaryotic-like actin forms a
shell-like structure that could strengthen cell resistance to
hydrostatic and osmotic pressures. Interestingly, these
genes are only present in Microcystis cells that inhabit the
Braakman water reservoir (The Netherlands), which was
cut off from the sea in the 20th century, and from which
the Mic-PCC7806 strain was originally isolated.
Although several different M. aeruginosa morphotypes
have been described [38], little is known about their colony formation. The genome sequence of strain MicPCC7806 revealed a gene coding for a lectin (mvn;
mic3128), which binds specifically to a sugar moiety
present on the surface of Mic-PCC7806 cells, and a binding partner has been identified in the lipoplysaccharide
fraction [39]. A functional correlation between the potent
toxin microcystin and this lectin has been demonstrated,
with possible implications for the formation of colonial
aggregates that are characteristic of different Microcystis
morphotypes. Another protein, MrpC (microcystinrelated protein C), has been shown to be a potential target
of an O-glycosyltransferase of the SPINDLY family [40]. In
situ, this protein accumulates at the cell surface, and is
involved in cellular interactions. Microcystins may therefore have an impact on the aggregation of Microcystis cells,
which is very important for the competitive advantage of
these organisms over other phytoplankton species. Mvn
and MrpC are predominantly encoded in toxic strains
[[38] and E. Dittmann, unpublished data], but not in the
genome of Mic-NIES843. The latter strain may thus represent an ecotype that differs from Mic-PCC7806 in the
characteristics of the cell surface. Genes coding for a Ser/
Thr kinase (mic0129) and a Ser/Thr phosphatase of the
PPP family (mic4622) are found within two clusters that
may be involved in cell wall synthesis. Mic-PCC7806 also
has two genes that encode Wzc-like protein Tyr kinases
(mic2086 and mic1089) and three genes coding for Wzblike protein Tyr phosphatases (mic3515, mic3588 and
mic6566). In E. coli, the function of these systems is
known to be related to the synthesis of the cell wall and
polysaccharides [41]. These kinases/phosphatases could
potentially be involved in colony formation. Colony
migration depends not only on the cell ballast resulting
from the accumulation of photosynthates and the size of
the colonies, but also on the synthesis of gas vesicles (GV),
intracellular structures providing cells with buoyancy
[42]. The Mic-PCC7806 genome carries a cluster of 12
genes required for GV synthesis, two of which, gvpV and
gvpW, are novel [43]. The mic1271 and mic1270 genes are
highly similar to the genes coding for a light-regulated
two-component system in Syn-PCC6803. This system,
which consists of a cyanobacterial phytochrome (Cph1)
and its response regulator (Rcp1), has been proposed to
play a role in the control of processes required for the
adaptation from light to dark conditions and vice-versa

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/274

[44]. Moreover, all the genes involved in circadian rhythm
[45] are present in Mic-PCC7806 (see Additional file 11).
Whether day-night cycles and the timing of vertical migration of Microcystis colonies in the water column are controlled by this phytochrome and by the circadian clock
mechanism would be worth being tested.
In natural populations of Microcystis, oxidative stress was
shown to induce programmed cell death (PCD) [46].
Accordingly, 5 putative eukaryotic caspase-like genes were
identified by PSI-Blast in the genome of strain MicPCC7806. Three of them (Mic0980, Mic3930 and
Mic4051) showed best similarity with Mic-NIES843 proteins that lack caspase-like motifs. Consequently, these
three proteins are likely involved in other functions than
PCD. In contrast, the Mic1068 protein showed similarity
in the caspase-like region with one protein of MicNIES843 (MAE24870). The last caspase-like protein of
Mic-PCC7806 (Mic5406) is strain-specific. Both mic1068
and mic5406 are expressed, and a cross-reaction with
human caspase-3 polyclonal antisera was observed indicating that the proteins are synthesized (data not shown).
Alignment of the regions containing the conserved caspase domains of Mic1068, Mic5406, MAE24870 and a
yeast metacaspase shows that the Histidine-Cysteine catalytic diad of the key functionnal regions of the capases is
conserved (see Additional file 12). PCD might thus be
triggered when Microcystis cells are exposed to severe environmental stress conditions, leading to the rapid decline
of blooms, as has been suggested by Berman-Frank et al.
in the case of Ter-IMS101 [47]. Mic-PCC7806 and MicNIES843 are the only unicellular cyanobacteria known to
have genes coding for HstK-like kinases (mic1879 and
mic1015), proteins characterized by the presence of both
His and Ser/Thr kinase domains [48,49]. Some of these
kinases are implicated in either the iron homeostasis/oxidative stress response or in the differentiation of N2-fixing
cells in filamentous cyanobacteria [[48,49] and C-C
Zhang, unpublished data]. Cell differentiation does not
occur in M. aeruginosa, but it would be interesting to test
whether these HstK-like protein kinases are involved in
iron homeostasis and/or in the control of programmed
cell death in response to oxidative stress. It has been proposed that the methionine recycling pathway may contribute to preventing oxidative stress in Bacillus subtilis
[50,51]. Interestingly, all the genes involved in this pathway are present in the Mic-PCC7806 genome (see Additional file 13). One of these genes, mtnW (rbcLIV), encodes
a 2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentyl-1-phosphate enolase
that has been identified in all the Microcystis strains tested
including Mic-NIES843 [21,52], but not in other cyanobacteria for which the genome sequences are available,
except Lae-PCC8106 (accession n° ZP_01618990) and
Cth-PCC8801 (accession n° ZP_02940034). The putative
methionine recycling pathway may thus have a specific

duction of the protease inhibitor aeruginoside in Planktothrix agardhii Cya 126 [61]. The genomic data therefore
clearly indicate that strain Mic-PCC7806 might be capable
of producing a variant of aeruginosin (Figure 5).

Genetic potential for the production of secondary metabolites
Cyanobacteria are known as prolific producers of natural
products, in particular of the nonribosomal peptide and
polyketide classes [15,53]. However, the potential to produce complex secondary metabolites largely varies among
the cyanobacterial genera and species, and even among
individual strains. Remarkably, the genomes of MicPCC7806, Mic-NIES843 and Cwa-WH8501 differ from
unicellular cyanobacteria of other genera in that they contain a large number of genes that encode nonribosomal
peptide synthetases (NRPS) and polyketide synthases
(PKS). Interestingly, such genes in Mic-PCC7806 outnumber those found in Mic-NIES843 and Cwa-WH8501
(Table 6). Apart from the terrestrial filamentous strain
Npu-PCC73102, Mic-PCC7806 devotes the largest percentage of its genome (~3.5%) to secondary metabolite
production (Table 6) [54].

The two remaining PKS I gene clusters do not show significant similarity to any known cyanobacterial biosynthetic
gene clusters, and may be involved in the production of
hitherto unknown compounds (Figure 5 and Table 6).
The first gene cluster encodes an iterative PKS I that is similar in both architecture and sequence to the PksE of various actinobacteria, and is accompanied by several
tailoring enzymes including three halogenases. The actinobacterial enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of
enedyine type antitumor antibiotics [62]. The second PKS
gene cluster encodes a modular PKS I complex accompanied by several putative tailoring enzymes, and a PKS III
type enzyme that is capable of synthesizing compounds of
the chalcone/stilbene family. These biosynthetic enzymes
are widespread in plants but have only recently been discovered in bacteria [63]. A comparison of the biosynthetic
potential of Mic-PCC7806 and Mic-NIES843 reveals that
three of the large NRPS/PKS complexes, namely those
dedicated to microcystin, cyanopeptolin and aeruginosin
production, are encoded on both genomes, whereas some
other gene clusters are not shared by both genomes. The
biosynthetic versatility of members of the genus Microcystis may thus be larger than expected, since the two
strains selected for genome sequencing have similar
chemotypes. Beside the NRPS and PKS encoding genes,
the genome of Mic-PCC7806 contains a gene cluster similar to the patellamide genes that were recently detected in
symbiotic cyanobacterial strains of ascidians [64]. Patellamides are a family of cyclic peptides generated from a
ribosomally-synthesized precursor. Mic-PCC7806 is the
first freshwater cyanobacterium showing the capability to
produce patellamide-like peptides. A peptide with striking
similarity to the patellamides, microcyclamide, has been

The strain Mic-PCC7806 is known to produce two isoforms of microcystin [55]. The corresponding genes in the
bi-directional mcyA-J gene cluster encoding NRPS, PKS
and tailoring enzymes [56,57] could be re-assigned during the genome sequencing project (Figure 5). Genes for
cyanopeptolin biosynthesis (mcn cluster) could be
assigned based on the amino acid specificities of the substrate-activating domains of a second NRPS gene cluster
that was congruent with the amino acid moieties contained in the cyanopeptolin structure [58] (Figure 5). The
mcn genes of Mic-PCC7806 display some similarity to the
anabaenopeptilide genes of Anabaena strain 90 [59] and
to the cyanopeptolin genes of Microcystis wesenbergii [60].
In addition, the genome of Mic-PCC7806 harbors three
NRPS and PKS gene clusters (Figure 5). One of the clusters
displays some similarity to the cluster involved in the pro-

reported in M. aeruginosa strain NIES-298 [65]. Chemical
analyses have revealed that the gene cluster discovered in
Mic-PCC7806 is indeed dedicated to the production of a
microcyclamide-type compound [66]. The genome of
Mic-PCC7806 could attract further attention, as it also
contains gene clusters comprising unique features that
have yet to be characterized and which may well produce
so-far unidentified natural substances.
Transporter genes are commonly found in the immediate
vicinity of the secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes.

These secondary metabolites may therefore at least partly
function at the surface of Microcystis cells, in the colonysurrounding sheath or in their planktonic environment.
Gene clusters involved in the synthesis of secondary
metabolites are frequently associated with genes that confer resistance to these metabolites, which would otherwise
be toxic to the cells producing them. In Mic-PCC7806,
only the transport system associated with the uncharacterized PKS I/PKS III hybrid compound (Figure 5) shows any
similarity to typical efflux transporters that potentially
confer self-resistance. The compound produced could

therefore have an allelopathic or antibacterial role in the
environment [67].

Conclusion
Among bacteria, members of the genus Microcystis have a
particularly high potential for the production of complex
secondary metabolites, although this is lower than that of
some actinobacterial and myxobacterial genomes that
have been shown to devote up to 10% of their coding
capacity to the production of secondary metabolites [68].
Genomics has already been useful to the study of secondary metabolites, and has restored natural product research
as a major field of pharmaceutical research [69]. Analysis
of the Mic-PCC7806 genome has revealed striking novel
biosynthetic features that might help to explain the ecological impact of these compounds, as well as guide the
search for novel metabolites of biotechnological importance.
Data mining of the genome sequence of Mic-PCC7806
has also shed light on genes that are of importance for the
colonial life style and survival of this cyanobacterium in
its natural habitat, either during the benthic phase or
when it forms blooms on the surface of the water. One of
the most intriguing features of this genome is its exceptional plasticity, characterized by a very large number of
long repeated sequences, and genes encoding transposases and putative restriction enzymes. These biological
entities may generate deletions, duplications, conversions, and rearrangements in the chromosome [70]. One
illustration of these changes is the marked loss of synteny
between this genome and other cyanobacterial genomes.
In addition, the presence of a large number of clustered
atypical genes in the genome of Mic-PCC7806 suggests
that frequent gene acquisition events by lateral transfers
have occurred.
Genome plasticity in prokaryotes is often considered to be
an adaptive strategy allowing microorganisms to promote
diversification in a way similar to sexual reproduction in
eukaryotic organisms. However, genomic rearrangements
can also impede the co-expression of genes [71] and disrupt gene dosage effects [70]. The resulting trade-off
between gene conservation and rearrangement in the
chromosome depends on various factors and processes
linked to the ecophysiology of the microorganisms. The
cost of chromosome rearrangements may be greater for
fast-growing bacteria, than for slow-growing ones such as
cyanobacteria [72]. The relative importance of the process
of gene co-expression in cyanobacteria is more difficult to
evaluate. However, it is worth noting that some of the
eight syntenic clusters found in Mic-PCC7806 concern
transport systems for nutrients, such as phosphate, which
is often the limiting factor in marine and freshwater ecosystems.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/274

Although Syn-PCC6803, Cwa-WH8501 and MicPCC7806 are phylogenetically closely related, only the
last two strains have highly plastic genomes containing
high proportions of long DNA repeats and transposase
genes. No obvious explanation can be deduced from the
ecophysiological features of these two strains. Indeed,
members of the genus Microcystis are freshwater colonial
cyanobacteria that proliferate in eutrophic ecosystems
(e.g. ≤ 2.107cells/ml in [73]) while the Crocosphaera are
marine nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria living in oligotrophic open oceans (≤ 103 cells/ml [74]). Microcystis colonies may display chaotic population dynamics, with
alternating explosion and crash phases [75], but to the
best of our knowledge, no such data are available for Crocosphaera. Such chaotic population dynamics could
explain the widespread occurrence of rearrangements in
the Mic-PCC7806 genome, if, as proposed by Helm et al.

generally promote the fixation of mildly harmful rearrangements.
More genome sequences of members of the Microcystis
and Crocosphaera genera are required to clarify the molecular basis of their genome plasticity, at both the intergeneric and intraspecies levels. This will also provide a
deeper understanding of the evolutionary significance of
this mode of adaptation to the environment. The ongoing
sequencing of such genomes should make it possible to
reach this goal in the near future. More generally, large
cyanobacterial genomes constitute excellent model systems for studying genome dynamics and the mechanism(s) by which some gene clusters may escape
rearrangement and retain the same physical organization
in several different lineages.

DNA preparation and sequencing
The strain Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 (kept in constant culture since its isolation in 1978; Pasteur Culture
Collection, Paris, France [18]) was grown as described
[52]. The genome sequence of Mic-PCC7806 was determined by a whole-genome shotgun strategy. Two libraries
were generated using genomic DNA extracted with the kit
Nucleobond AGX500 (Macherey-Nagel, Hoerdt, France)
and shared by nebulization. The first library contained
inserts from 1 to 4 kb cloned in pcDNA2.1 (Invitrogen
Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the second
included inserts from 5 to 8 kb cloned in the low-copy
vector pSYX34 (gift of F. Kunst, Institut Pasteur, Paris,
France). A BAC library was constructed into the vector
pBeloBAC11 (inserts ≤ 20 kb) (Epicentre, Madison, USA)

using spooled DNA extracted as described [78] and partially hydrolyzed with HindIII.
Plasmid DNA purification was performed using the Montage Plasmid Miniprep96 Kit (Millipore, Molsheim,
France) or the TempliPhi DNA sequencing template
amplification kit (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). BAC
Miniprep96 Kit (Millipore, Molsheim, France) was used
for BAC templates. Sequencing reactions were done, from
both ends of DNA inserts, using ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing ready reactions kit and run on a
3700 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA). The trace file was used with the Phred-PhrapConsed package to perform the assembly [79]. Sequencing reactions were performed to close gaps, improve coverage and resolve sequence ambiguities using PCR
products amplified from genomic DNA or DNA plasmid
templates.
Phylogenetic analysis
A dataset containing a concatenation of the 16S and 23S
sequences was aligned by Muscle [80], and the alignment
was manually edited to remove ambiguously aligned
positions, giving a final dataset of 4195 nucleotide positions for phylogenetic analysis. From this dataset, a maximum likelihood tree was calculated by Phyml [81], using
the HKY model of nucleotide evolution with an estimation of the transition/transversion ratio, including 4 rates
of site heterogeneity, an estimated number of invariable
positions, and an estimated alpha shape parameter. The
numbers at the nodes correspond to the bootstrap values
calculated on 1000 resampled datasets by Phyml.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/274

bi-directional best hits using BLASTp (bitscore of 30%
against itself). This Markov model takes into account the
Markov probability matrix of the core genes to analyse
whether the composition of the CDS under study is "atypical", using the formula described in [25]. For each CDS,
the model calculates an index that represents the likelihood that CDS will have a dinucleotide composition
compatible with that of the core genes. In order to assess
significance cutoffs, we applied the following statistics
[82]: for each gene analyzed, one million random
sequences were generated based on the Markov model
probability matrix of the core genes, and the Markov
index was calculated for each of these random sequences.
The results were then analyzed by a one-tailed test with
cut-offs of 0.1%. The cut-off was defined after several in
silico horizontal gene transfer simulations, during which
random genes from different genomes were introduced
artificially into the genome sequences under study. The
optimal threshold (0.1%) was defined for all the genomes
of the group as the value at which the model had the highest detection of the in silico introduced genes (true positives), and the lowest detection of core genes (false
positives).
Clustering of atypical genes
We defined an initial cluster of at least 4 neighboring atypical genes which was allowed to grow (in both directions)
searching for other nearby atypical genes, until regions
containing 4 or more non-atypical genes appeared. By this
process, a reduced number of less-atypical genes and of
normal genes could be included in a larger CAG.

Abbreviations
Syntenic score computation
Ten orthologs located on either side of one pair of putatively orthologous CDS (linked by BDBH) were analyzed.
For each pair of orthologous genes located in the proximity of the tested gene and of its ortholog, the synteny score
was incremented by 1. Using this method of calculation,
two totally syntenic genomes will have a score of 20 attributed to each of their orthologs, whereas two-non syntenic
genomes will have a score of 0.
Restriction-modification enzymes
Putative restriction enzymes were identified by Blast
searching of known type I and II restriction enzymes
against the Mic-PCC7806 genome. Because DNA methylases are more reliably identified by Blast than restriction
enzymes, we also identified all methylases, and examined
the surrounding genes for potential restriction enzymes.
Detection of atypical CDSs
A first-order Markov model was built based on the dinucleotide composition of the core genes of a group of 8
selected cyanobacterial genomes (Table 4), identified by

CDS: coding sequence; HSP: high scoring segment pair;
BDBH: bidirectional best hit; rDNA: ribosomal DNA;
CAG: cluster of atypical gene; BV: bootstrap value. NRPS:
nonribosomal peptide synthetase; PKS: polyketide synthase; N50: contig size such that all the larger contigs contain 50% of the bases of the assembly.
