Background: Proteins with obscure features (POFs), which lack currently defined motifs or
domains, represent between 18% and 38% of a typical eukaryotic proteome. To evaluate the
contribution of this class of proteins to the diversity of eukaryotes, we performed a comparative
analysis of the predicted proteomes derived from 10 different sequenced genomes, including
budding and fission yeast, worm, fly, mosquito, Arabidopsis, rice, mouse, rat, and human.

sequences, in particular those of regulatory genes, features of
non-coding sequences and repetitive DNA, and gene number

eukaryotes has focused largely on genes that encode proteins
with experimentally defined domains or motifs (proteins with
defined features (PDFs)) [5,6]. Because the analysis of PDFs

Results: Only 1,650 protein groups were found to be conserved among these proteomes (BLAST

that, on average, 60% of the POFs identified in these 10 proteomes (44,236 in total) were species
specific. In contrast, only 7.5% of the proteins with defined features (PDFs) were species specific
(17,554 in total). As a group, POFs appear similar to PDFs in their relative contribution to biological
functions, as indicated by their expression, participation in protein-protein interactions and
association with mutant phenotypes. However, POF have more predicted disordered structure
than PDFs, implying that they may exhibit preferential involvement in species-specific regulatory
and signaling networks.

Noticeably lacking from the comparative analysis of eukaryotic genomes to date, however, is an analysis of the origins and
functions of genes encoding proteins that currently lack
defined motifs or domains (proteins with obscure features
(POFs)) [7,8]. Expression profiling studies in different organisms suggested that POFs play an important role in many different biological processes. Nevertheless, their biological
roles and origins remain poorly understood and elucidating
their functions is currently a major goal of biological research
in almost all organisms studied [7,8]. In this paper we examine the possibility that genes encoding POFs, which account
for approximately one-quarter of all eukaryotic genes, play a
role in determining differences among species. By analogy to
the expectation that PDFs are often conserved among species
[4-6], one might expect that POFs would show a parallel pattern of phylogenetic conservation. To test this assumption, we
performed a comparative analysis of 10 different eukaryotic
proteomes, including budding and fission yeast, worm, fruit
fly, mosquito, Arabidopsis, rice, mouse, rat, and human. Surprisingly, in contrast to PDFs, we found that POFs include a
much larger percentage of proteins that are highly divergent.
Our results underscore the importance of delineating the origins and functions of POFs as an underlying cause of species
specificity.

revealed a high degree of similarity among different species,
it has been accepted widely that the uniqueness of a particular
species was driven by changes in regulatory genes or elements
[1-6], as opposed to the divergence of established coding
sequences or the creation of new genes. This has led to a widespread perspective that just a few model organisms can provide the experimental foundation to assign functions to
nearly every eukaryotic gene.

(from 10-9 to 10-80 or less). This method of plotting similarity
differences permits the visualization of reproducible differences between PDFs and POFs across a wide range of cutoff
thresholds. Unless noted otherwise, a BLAST similarity of
greater than 10-6 was used as the cutoff threshold for classifying a sequence as related. Using this similarity threshold, a

Among the 10 proteomes, POFs always showed significantly
more divergence than PDFs, as illustrated for S. cerevisiae
and S. pombe, or M. musculus and R. norvegicus in Figure 2a,
b, respectively (and documented for all proteomes in Figures
1S to 3S in in Additional data file 1). For example, in a comparison of proteomes from budding and fission yeast (Figure
2a), the percentage of similar POFs was typically five-fold less
than PDFs, when evaluated with BLAST cutoff thresholds
from 10-6 to 10-18. This difference can also be illustrated by
comparing the BLAST values that correspond to the point at
which 50% of the PDFs or POFs show relatedness with other
proteomes (referred to as the 50% similarity point). In the
case of budding and fission yeast, these E-values correspond
to approximately 1 for POFs and 10-30 for PDFs. Using a 50%
similarity point as a standard for comparison, the POFs from
fission and budding yeast show 30 orders of magnitude
higher divergence than PDFs. This higher divergence of POFs
was also corroborated in comparisons of Sc with the nine
other proteomes (Sc versus All, Figure 2a; Figures 1S and 2S
in Additional data file 1). The same pattern of POFs divergence was seen in a pair-wise comparison of the two insect
proteomes, the two plant proteomes, and the two vertebrate
proteomes (Figure 2b; Figures 1S and 2S in Additional data
file 1).

The recent publication of a draft chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes (Pt)) genome [11] provided us with a unique opportunity to compare the similarity of POFs and PDFs encoded in
two proteomes that are estimated to have diverged only 5 to 7
million years ago. Compared to the degree of similarity
among POFs from human and mouse, the degree of identity
among POFs from human and chimpanzee was much higher
(Figure 3S in Additional data file 1). To examine what proportion of human-specific proteins are POFs or PDFs we performed a BLAST search (E-value cutoff of 10-6) of all
published sequences against the human proteome. Consistent with POFs representing the majority of species-specific
proteins (Figure 3a), POFs accounted for all 27 expressed
human-specific proteins (Table 5S in Additional data file 1)
not observed in the genomes of any other organism.

To evaluate POFs for their functional relevance, we first compared the percentage of PDFs and POFs that were represented in expressed sequence tag (EST) collections (Figure
4a). The six animal transcriptomes all showed a greater than
95% representation for transcripts encoding POFs. This high
representation was only slightly less than that observed for
PDFs. Whereas the two plant transcriptomes showed a somewhat larger difference, the POFs still showed a representation
of greater than 75%. Thus, POFs are similar to PDFs in their
representation as actively expressed mRNAs.

only 7.5% (17,554 in total) of the PDFs.

To compare the relative phenotypic contribution of both protein groups, we examined the percent representation of corresponding mutant phenotypes from the genome-wide
functional analyses conducted for S. cerevisiae (Sc) [10] (Figure 4c). With the exception of a potentially noteworthy twofold lower representation of POFs in the essential gene categories, PDFs and POFs showed a similar percent contribution
to other phenotypic categories. Similar results were found
with C. elegans genome-wide functional analysis (Ce) [9]
(data not shown).

Average sequence similarity relationship trees constructed
for all 10 proteomes, based on POFs or PDFs (Figure 3b),
revealed that the divergence of POFs among the 10 different
proteomes was consistently greater than that of PDFs, supporting the contention that POFs account for the majority of
phylogenetically specific ORFs (Figure 3a).

Together, the findings presented in Figure 4 suggest that
POFs, as a group, are not being mis-represented by an unusually high percentage of proteins being incorrectly predicted
from inaccurate gene models. Rather, POFs appear comparable to PDFs in their relative contribution to an organism's
repertoire of functional proteins.

addition to the absence of established motifs and domains,
POFs, on average, have physical characteristics that further
distinguish them from PDFs.

Assigning a role to proteins with unknown function is a major
goal of current and future genomic research. Homology
searches have traditionally been used to assign specific
domain structures to proteins, thereby classifying them into
protein families with putative function [5,6]. The distinction
made in this paper between proteins with defined motifs or
domains (PDFs), and those with undefined or obscure features (POFs) (Figure 1), underlined proteins that could not be
assigned any known function by homology searches. Interestingly, POFs as a group were found to be shorter, more
hydrophilic and more disordered than PDFs (Figure 5).

information

To investigate if there are any structural characteristics other
than established motifs and domains that might distinguish
POFs from PDFs, the physical properties of the two groups of
proteins were examined. Compared to PDFs, POFs as a group
are 40% shorter (Figure 5a; ANOVA p < 0.001), have a higher
percentage of disordered structure (Figure 5b; ANOVA p <
0.001), a higher content of hydrophilic residues (Figure 5c;
ANOVA p < 0.001), a higher content of small amino acids (for

One explanation as to why POFs show a higher degree of species specificity than PDFs is that POFs, in contrast to PDFs,
could include a disproportionately higher number of proteins
incorrectly predicted from pseudogenes or incorrect gene
models. This could result in an artifact in which random
sequences or non-functional proteins distort the overall
diversity of this group of proteins. However, several lines of
evidence presented here (Figures 2, 4 and 5) suggest that this
trivial explanation is not the case. For example, even in the
relatively well-characterized yeast genomes, the pattern of
higher sequence diversification among the POFs is consistent
with that seen in the larger more complex genomes. Furthermore, as a group, POFs appear similar to PDFs with respect to
mRNA expression, phenotypic penetrance, and involvement
in protein-protein interactions.

Our analysis of 10 different proteomes (Figures 1 to 3; Figures

in conservation between PDFs and POFs. E-value plots show
that this difference is evident whether similarities are measured with stringent or non-stringent criteria. With a minimum E-value similarity threshold of 10-6, a total of 44,236
phylogenetically specific POFs were identified (Figure 3a). In
contrast, relatively few (17,544) PDFs were identified as phylogenetically specific. The opposite trend was observed for
conserved proteins. Only 3 POF groups were conserved in all
10 proteomes, in contrast to 1,650 PDF groups (Tables 1S and
2S in Additional data file 1). In total, 60% of POFs appear to
be phylogenetically restricted, in contrast to only 7.5% of

ordered structure (Figure 5). Empirical definitions of disordered structures have been derived from examining regions
of proteins that fail to show a consistent or defined structure
in a crystallized protein. These regions of disorder show a
strong correlation with biochemical studies that suggest their
involvement in protein-protein interactions, as well as in providing key regions for regulating a protein's activity via a
structural conformation switch [14-18]. Importantly, the disorder prediction software programs used here do not provide
high scores to random 'junk' DNA sequences, providing
another line of evidence that gene models encoding POFs
were not just artifactual predictions derived from 'junk' DNA.
Rather, the high levels of disordered structures in POFs support their potential roles in regulatory networks in which protein conformational changes or protein-protein interactions
are key.
Together, the above arguments strongly support the view that
the average POF is just as likely to have a biological function
as a protein with a defined motif or domain. We favor, therefore, a genetic explanation for the unusual diversity within
the group of POFs. That explanation is that genes encoding
the majority of POFs are arising de novo or diverging at an
evolutionary rate much higher than genes encoding PDFs. In
support of this possibility, POFs are consistently more divergent among different proteomes (Figure 3b), and are preferentially represented as singletons in the different genomes
(Figure 4S in Additional data file 1).
There may be several distinct mechanisms contributing to the
genetic diversity of POFs. For example, some POFs may have
structures that are highly flexible and can diverge with few
structural constraints. By contrast, some POFs may have conserved tertiary structures, but are nevertheless showing rapid
divergence in their primary sequence. In either case, a widely
conserved motif or distinct domain signature may never be
found within the primary sequences of a large subset of the
currently defined POFs. Nevertheless, some POFs may ultimately be found to have definable features. One reason that
these features currently remain undefined may be related to
the sociology of science. In general, scientists have focused
their molecular research on relatively few organisms, and
devoted most of their resources to in-depth studies of relatively few proteins. Those proteins or pathways are often chosen because of their general relevance to fundamental
questions in a broad group of organisms or because these proteins exhibit strong evolutionary conservation and are judged
on this basis to have greater intrinsic functional relevance. By
contrast, the study of a species-specific protein is often a
lonely pursuit. Another source of bias lies in the tendency
inherent in classical biochemical methods, which are strongly
biased towards the production and characterization of folded,
active proteins that have highly ordered structures (for example, PDFs) and for which structural information is more readily obtained [19]. In contrast, disordered proteins (for
example, POFs) are less well studied because they lack a read-

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/7/R57

ily recognized activity and structural information is more difficult to obtain for these proteins.
Previous work identified a class of proteins termed 'ORFans'
that have no significant sequence similarity to any other open
reading frame (ORF) and are, therefore, unique to a specific
organism [20-22]. In contrast to the definition of POFs that is
based on the presence of an observed domain or motif, the
definition of an ORFan is based strictly on sequence homology. Thus, ORFans could include POFs as well as PDFs.
Indeed, as shown in Figure 3a, POFs and PDFs accounted for
70.4% (42,218) and 29.6% (17,544) of all proteins unique
among the 10 analyzed proteomes, respectively. Moreover,
the majority of POFs from Mm and Rn were found to be similar (Figure 3a), suggesting that although some overlap exists
between ORFans and POFs, homologs of many POFs can be
found in similar genomes (Figure 3a). An interesting observation that was recently made for ORFans could also hold true
for POFs. It was observed that some ORFans, although demonstrating no sequence homology to any known protein,
could fold into a three-dimensional structure that resembled
a protein with a known function [22]. In addition to being
novel genes unique to an organism or a lineage, some POFs or
ORFans could, therefore, be the result of convergent evolution. Thus, they might be distant members of known proteins,
with similar functions and three-dimensional structure, but
with sequences that have diverged beyond recognition.

Conclusion

The advent of genome sequences has reinvigorated an effort
to understand the origins of species specificity. This is a
daunting challenge, emphasized by the fact that in the 10 proteomes analyzed here we identified 44,236 phylogenetically
specific proteins with undefined or obscure features (POFs).
In contrast to PDFs, which have established domains or
motifs that can be used to formulate working hypotheses
about a protein's function, advancing our understanding of
POFs must proceed without such clues. Our analysis here
provides an expectation that, on average, 60% of a eukaryote's set of POFs will be highly divergent, and that functional
studies will ultimately need to be conducted on a species-specific basis. For example, the human genome encodes 27 proteins that currently cannot be found in genome sequences of
any model organism, including the chimpanzee sequence
(Table 5S in Additional data file 1). Consistent with expectations from this study, these human-specific proteins are all
POFs. Eventually, the function of these unique proteins will
need to be studied in humans. Our results support a general
expectation that to understand the unique biology of a given
organism will ultimately involve understanding the functions
of an unexpectedly large number of proteins that have: no
defined motifs or domains; are likely to have significant
regions of disordered structure; and are restricted to a single
species or a closely related phylogenetic branch.

(Table 6S in Additional data file 1), and for sequence length
and relative disorder of POFs and PDFs (Figure 5a, b).
Because the average length of the POFs was shorter than that
of the PDFs, a length correction was used to eliminate bias in
the scoring function of the program.

Prediction of relative disorder for PDFs and POFs was performed with the DisEMBL 1.4 prediction program [35]. Due
to the large numbers of proteins that were analyzed, we used
DisEMBL locally rather than at the website [36]. To obtain an
overall value for the percentage of proteins that were disordered, SAS V9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used
to sum the total regions that were predicted to be disordered
and to divide it by the length for each protein analyzed.
Hydrophilic index and amino acid content were calculated
with the ad hoc perl script hydrophil.pl, developed by GarayArroyo et al. [37] using the Kyte-Doolittle values for
hydrophilicity. SAS was used to perform statistical analysis
(descriptive statistics and ANOVA) for the hydrophilic index
of POFs and PDFs from hydrophil.pl results (Figure 5c), for
variations in amino acid content between POFs and PDFs

refereed research

BLAST comparisons of PDFs and POFs among different proteomes were performed using TeraBLAST running on an
accelerated DeCypher server [32]. The comparisons of PDFs
and POFs between each proteome and its respective collection of ESTs or between PDFs and POFs from each proteome
and all other genomes translated in all reading frames were
accomplished using TBLASTn [33]. ESTs were obtained on 5
December, 2004 from NCBI [23] except for Arabidopsis,
which was downloaded at the same time from TAIR [24]. To
examine the representation of PDFs and POFs from Sc or Ce
in existing phenotypic studies, or existing protein-protein
interaction datasets, POFs and PDFs, obtained as described
above, were matched to existing datasets [9,10,12,13,34].

'All-against-all' comparisons used to generate sets of speciesspecific proteins for both PDFs and POFs from Sc, Sp, At, Os,
Dm, Ag, Ce, Mm, Rn and Hs were performed using TeraBLAST running on an accelerated DeCypher server [32], with a
cutoff threshold of 10-6. A tree showing the relationships
among Sc, Sp, At, Os, Dm, Ag, Ce, Mm, Rn and Hs proteomes
was constructed using the reciprocal percentage of the
number of genes that the organisms have in common. This
tree was constructed using the SAS cluster procedure utilizing
the average linkage method, and graphed using the SAS tree
procedure [38]. Tree diagrams are discussed in the context of
cluster analysis by Hartigan [39], and Everitt [40].

reports

To standardize the classification for which proteins are POFs
and which are PDFs, we applied a consistent analysis method
to all genes regardless of their current annotation. This analysis method involved an HMMPFAM [26] search against several major signature databases: PFAM [27], TIGRFAM [28],
SMART [29], and Superfamily [30]. A protein sequence with
a match to one or more of the models in any one of these databases, including domains of unknown function, was flagged
as a PDF. Sequences with no matches to any one of the models
in any database were flagged as a POF. The definition of POFs
used in our work was similar to that used in [9,31].
