Conclusions: The incorporation of both joint conservation and spacing constraints of sequence
pairs predicts groups of target genes that are specific for common patterns of gene expression.
Our work suggests that positional information, especially the relative spacing between
transcription factor binding sites, may represent a common organizing principle of transcription
control regions.

Results: We used the genome sequences of four yeast species of the genus Saccharomyces to
identify sequences potentially involved in multifactorial control of gene expression. We found 989
potential regulatory 'templates': pairs of hexameric sequences that are jointly conserved in
transcription regulatory regions and also exhibit non-random relative spacing. Many of the
individual sequences in these templates correspond to known transcription factor binding sites, and
the sets of genes containing a particular template in their transcription control regions tend to be
differentially expressed in conditions where the corresponding transcription factors are known to
be active. The incorporation of word pairs to define sequence features yields more specific
predictions of average expression profiles and more informative regression models for genomewide expression data than considering sequence conservation alone.

Background: Transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes often involves multiple transcription
factors binding to the same transcription control region, and to understand the regulatory content
of eukaryotic genomes it is necessary to consider the co-occurrence and spatial relationships of
individual binding sites. The determination of conserved sequences (often known as phylogenetic
footprinting) has identified individual transcription factor binding sites. We extend this concept of
functional conservation to higher-order features of transcription control regions.

Abstract

Background

All organisms have evolved intricate signaling networks that
sense and respond to their environment. At a cellular level,
the activation of one or more signaling networks often leads
to coordinated changes in gene expression, via the regulated
activity and binding of transcription factors to transcription
control regions (TCRs) of genes (for example, enhancers and
upstream activating sequences). In yeast and most other
eukaryotes, the transcriptional regulation of individual genes
is often multifactorial, as multiple transcription factors may
bind to a single TCR [1,2]. Multifactorial regulation encompasses several distinct biochemical mechanisms. In some
cases, transcription factors may bind cooperatively to adjacent DNA sites via direct physical interaction [3,4]. In other
cases, multiple transcription factors that bind independently
may recruit a common co-activator [5], or may act independently of one another to alter gene expression in response to
distinct cellular cues [6]. Recent studies have also suggested
that nearby transcription factors may collaboratively compete
with nucleosomes, thus enhancing the binding of individual
transcription factors [7,8]. Many experiments in yeast have
shown that specific pairs of factors must be bound near each
other for multifactorial regulation to occur [7–10], and it is on
these spatial constraints that we focus here.
The challenges in understanding how regulatory information
is encoded in genomes include both the identification of regulatory sequences in TCRs and the elucidation of sequence
constraints on productive multifactorial regulation. Previous
computational work has been devoted to identifying putative
binding sites for transcription factors. A plethora of computational methods has been developed to find over-represented
sequences in a subset of genes believed to contain a common
transcription factor binding site (reviewed in [11]). The rapid
pace of genome sequencing has enabled a complementary
approach - phylogenetic footprinting (reviewed in [12,13]) which recognizes that the conservation of sequences across
related organisms often reflects evolutionary selection for
their presence in TCRs. Several algorithms have been developed to perform systematic phylogenetic footprinting analyses [14–16].
After compiling a collection of putative binding sites, associations can be made between various binding site assortments
and gene expression. Some recent approaches include
Boolean logic [17], regression methods [18–21], spatial clustering [22], and multiple binding site matrix classifiers [23–
25]. Spatial information on the relative locations of binding
sites is ignored in all but the last two classes of approaches.
The primary aim of this work was to incorporate positional
information and phylogenetic footprinting in methods of
identifying sequence motifs that may regulate gene expression. Consequently, we expanded the focus of phylogenetic
footprinting from the conservation of contiguous sequences
to higher-order features of TCRs, namely the spatial

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/7/R43

organization of individual binding sites. Because transcription factors participating in multifactorial regulation may
require binding sites in physical proximity to each other, we
searched for groups of conserved sequences that were more
closely spaced in TCRs than expected. We refer to these spatially organized sequences as conserved 'word templates'. As
a proof of principle, we started with the simplest example of
such templates: pairs of conserved words of 6 base-pairs (bp).
Conservation was assessed using the genome sequences of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and three closely related Saccharomyces species, which had been sequenced to identify conserved regulatory sequences [26]. To exploit this comparative
genomic data, we have devised a method that systematically
tested sequence pairs for joint conservation across genomes
and close spacing within individual TCRs. As genes regulated
by the same set of transcription factors often display similar
gene-expression patterns in certain experimental conditions,
we identified pairs of conserved word templates whose gene
targets were associated with common changes in gene expression. We adopted a group-by-sequence approach to first identify genes that contained the word-pair templates and then to
test for significant associations with expression levels of the
identified genes [27]. Significant associations between conserved word-pair templates and specific gene-expression
changes and the prevalence of known transcription factor
binding sites suggest that conserved word-pair templates
comprise sequences important for multifactorial regulation
in yeast. In addition, conserved word-pair templates represent more specific predictors of gene expression than individual words or word pairs in S. cerevisiae.

Results
Identification of conserved word-pair templates
Multiple genome sequences provide additional power to studies of gene regulation. Because of natural selection, mutations
accumulate more rapidly in non-functional DNA regions than
in functionally constrained bases. Given a multiple sequence
alignment of orthologous sequences from closely related species, the aligned and invariant regions should be enriched for
functionally important residues [12,13]. Additional Saccharomyces genomes were sequenced to ensure sufficient
sequence similarity to S. cerevisiae such that orthologous
regions could be reliably aligned, yet enough sequence divergence that functional sequences would be much more conserved than nonfunctional sequences [26,28]. To confirm
that regulatory sequences were found in conserved regions,
we tested a database of 47 known, nonredundant regulatory
motifs and found that 35 show conservation ratios that were
more than three standard deviations above that expected by
chance [26,29].
We present a method to find conserved higher-order
sequence templates from related Saccharomyces genomes
(Figure 1). Our method incorporates sequential statistical
tests, with each step focusing on a distinct property of

To test systematically whether words were conserved more
often in the same intergenic regions of the Saccharomyces
genomes than expected by independent conservation, a chisquare test was performed on all possible pairwise combinations of words (see Materials and methods). Pairs of words
that overlapped each other by more than three nucleotides
were excluded. A significant proportion of word pairs showed
dependent conservation: among the 2.16 million word pairs
tested, 8,452 of them (approximately 0.4%) had conservation

After correcting for multiple testing by controlling the false
discovery rate (FDR), a total of 989 out of 8,452 word pairs
(around 12%) had significantly small values (FDR q < 0.05)
for D (Figure 2). For a list of these closely spaced and jointly
¯
conserved word pairs see Additional data files. As a negative
control, we also assayed a sample of word pairs that did not
show dependent conservation (conservation χ2 < 1), yet were
jointly conserved in at least 10 TCRs. No word pairs in a random sample of 42,718 pairs with nondependent conservation
¯
(χ2 < 1) showed significantly small values for D, after correction for multiple testing. Figure 2 illustrates the distributions
of D for conserved word-pair templates, jointly conserved
¯
word pairs, and randomly conserved word pairs. The medians
of these distance distributions were 54 nucleotides, 73
nucleotides and 89 nucleotides, respectively. Notably, the
median D for template pairs was significantly smaller (p <
¯
0.05) than the median D for randomly conserved pairs. These
¯
results indicate that many of the word pairs that were
conserved in the same intergenic regions of multiple Saccharomyces genomes also exhibited closer spacing in TCRs.

conserved sequence templates. The simplest instances of
sequence templates involve word pairs and their relative
spacing. As described in detail below, pairs of words that were
conserved in the same intergenic regions of four Saccharomyces genomes were identified using a chi-square test for
independence. Next, a permutation test was used to select
word pairs whose physical proximity was closer than that
expected by chance. Finally, to evaluate the transcriptional
information contained in conserved word pairs with close
spacing, the expression of genes containing TCR templates
was compared to the rest of the genome. We initialized our
word list using all 2,080 words of length 6, treating a given
word and its reverse complement as identical. For each TCR
(consisting of up to 600 bp upstream of an open reading
frame), a word was labeled conserved if all six bases were
identical in at least three of the four Saccharomyces
genomes, on the basis of the CLUSTALW alignment of that
TCR.

The effects of base-composition fluctuations, as well as varying lengths of TCRs, motivated our nonparametric statistical
test for close spacing. We used the median, denoted by D, to
¯
summarize a distribution of minimum distances between two
words in S. cerevisiae. This distribution was calculated on the
basis of the genes whose TCRs conserved both words, and is
independent of the relative word order. If two nonoverlapping words were closely spaced in all TCRs, we should find D
¯
to be smaller than expected by chance. The statistical significance of this spacing was assessed using a permutation test by
selecting the set of genes that contained a conserved word
pair and then randomizing the assignment of one of the words
to the genes containing that word (see Materials and methods). By permuting the TCR labels for one of the words, but
not the word positions themselves, we retained the positional
biases of individual words within intergenic regions.

in yeast. For the templates associated with gene-expression changes see
Figure 3.

Next, we selected word pairs that displayed closer physical
spacing in intergenic regions than expected by chance. The
choice of a statistical test to evaluate close distances must
consider the local fluctuations of A+T nucleotide content in
genome sequences. Previous work used a Poisson distribution to evaluate proximity between binding sites [22]. However, variability in base composition can skew occurrences of
arbitrary sequences away from their expected distributions.
Indeed, this statistical test was confounded by large fluctuations in the Poisson parameter estimates, which varied up to
twofold within a single chromosome [22].

threshold for multiple testing or was less than 10 times more
significant than the K-S p-value for a gene subset associated
with either word alone (see Materials and methods). The latter criterion minimizes gene-expression changes that can be
explained by the presence of a single conserved word.

Conserved word-pair templates were significantly
associated with gene expression
Our method identified conserved word-pair templates that
were statistically significant with respect to both co-conservation in multiple genomes and close spacing in S. cerevisiae
TCRs. To evaluate the regulatory information in these templates, we assessed the statistical association between gene
groups that shared a template and changes in gene expression. Similarly to other group-by-sequence approaches for
finding regulatory sequences, we expect that gene subsets
defined by common TCR sequence features should have geneexpression patterns that are similar under conditions where
the transcription factors are active, yet are different from the
average expression of genes in the genome [27].
To assess the association between conserved word-pair templates and differentially expressed genes, we identified gene
subsets whose TCRs contained both conserved words in the
template and observed their expression patterns in S. cerevisiae in publicly available datasets ([30–35], see Materials and
methods for details). We then conducted Kolmogorov-

Figure 3a shows the number of conserved word-pair templates that were significantly associated with gene-expression
changes, for varying significance levels of the K-S test, which
have been corrected for multiple testing (see Materials and
methods). Each line indicates the number of gene subsets that
were significant in a different minimum number of experimental conditions. Several hundred closely spaced word pairs
were significantly associated with differential gene expression. For example, 314 word pairs met an FDR-corrected significance threshold of p < 10-3 for five or more experimental
conditions, which represented approximately 32% of all
closely spaced word pairs.
The proportion of conserved word-pair templates showing
significant associations with gene expression was compared
to two sets of negative controls, comprising word pairs that
failed either the first (co-conservation) or second (close spacing) statistical test. For the first control, we used a sample of
624 word pairs that failed the joint conservation test (conservation χ2 < 1) found in at least 25 TCRs, but also showed modest constraints on word pair spacing (p < 0.15). Only eight of
these word pairs (approximately 1.3%) were significantly
associated with gene-expression changes at an FDR-corrected threshold of p < 10-3 for five or more experimental conditions. To assess the relative enrichment for significant
associations with gene-expression changes at a variety of
multiple testing thresholds, we computed an odds ratio: the
proportion of significant associations among the template
pairs, divided by the proportion of significant associations
among the random pairs. For the above threshold, the odds
ratio was about 22. In other words, gene groups that contain
a common conserved word-pair template in their TCRs were
about 22 times more likely to be associated with significant
gene-expression changes, compared with gene groups
selected using randomly conserved word pairs. As shown in
Figure 3b, the odds ratios for association with gene expression changes in multiple conditions varied between 10 and 35.
This analysis was repeated for a sample of 2,737 co-conserved
(conservation χ2 > 31.1) word pairs that failed the close spacing test (permutation p > 0.05 after multiple testing), yet

occurred in at least 10 intergenic regions. The relative enrichment for gene expression associations in closely spaced words
is displayed in Figure 3c. Among co-conserved word pairs,
those pairs that were closely spaced than expected were still
about 2 to 12 times more likely to be significantly associated
with gene expression changes, compared to word pairs that
were not found to have significantly close spacing. We confirmed that gene groups associated with significant gene
expression changes did not have statistically significant differences in their TCR sizes, as assessed by a permutation test
(data not shown). Thus, gene groups that contained co-conserved and spatially close word pairs are more significantly
associated with gene-expression changes than expected by
chance.

along with a conserved Met31/32p-binding site, and the distances between the conserved sites in these genes were also
smaller than expected by chance. These results agree with the
known interaction of Cbf1p and Met31/32p for the regulation
of genes involved in sulfur utilization (see Discussion).

Many identified sequences represented known transcription factor binding sites

Conditions with significant gene-expression changes
coincided with transcription factor activity

In addition to their statistical significance, many conserved
word-pair templates that were most strongly associated with
gene-expression changes were consistent with biological
information on the transcription factors known to bind those
sites [36]. In all analyses described below, we used a set of 314
word pairs that had significant associations with geneexpression changes at an FDR-corrected multiple testing
threshold of p < 10-3 for five or more experiments. For visualization purposes, we organized the P × C matrix by hierarchically clustering the K-S p-values for the 314 word pairs (see
Materials and methods for details).

Further support that templates contain transcriptional regulatory information was obtained from a key observation: the
experimental conditions with significant gene-expression
changes often corresponded to conditions in which the cognate transcription factors are known to be active (Table 2). In
addition, many gene subsets that shared an individual wordpair template in their TCRs were highly enriched for geneexpression changes. We will survey examples of word-pair
templates associated with gene-expression changes, focusing
our attention on several environmental stress conditions. The
environmental stress response represents a paradigm for
multifactorial control of transcription regulation. Genomewide expression studies found that around 300 genes were
induced and around 600 genes were repressed in response to
a wide variety of stressful environmental transitions [30,37].
Many of these genes also showed subtly different expression
patterns in response to specific stimuli, suggesting that the
common environmental stress response may be modulated
by the activity of condition-specific transcription factors [30].

Hierarchical clustering of this output matrix identified
groups of word pairs with similar K-S p-values in specific subsets of experimental conditions (Figure 4). For these
clustered output matrices, see Additional data files. In many
cases, the word pairs that clustered together also comprised
overlapping hexamer sequences, suggesting that some of the
hexamers in different pairs may represent a larger, somewhat
variable sequence (Table 1). For example, group 9 in Figure 4
included six word pairs. In each of these word pairs, one of the
component words - such as TCACGT, CACGTG, or ACGTGC matched part of the consensus binding site for Cbf1p
(TCACGTG). The other component word in each pair - such as
ACTGTG, CTGTGG, TGTGGC or GTGGCT - represented part
of the known Met31/32p binding site (AAACTGTGG). Therefore, genes whose TCRs contained any word pair within this
group probably contained a conserved Cbf1p-binding site,

Table 1 shows a partial list of the 14 most significant groups of
consensus sequences, which were assembled by joining adjacent word pairs in the clustered output matrix with
overlapping sequences. Many of these consensus sequences
matched transcription factor binding sites that had been biochemically verified. Several pairs of transcription factors,
denoted by stars in Table 1, were not previously known to act
on the same sets of target genes.

Over a third of the conserved word-pair templates were associated with gene-expression changes in multiple environmental stress conditions (Figure 4a, Tables 1, 2). The largest group
of overlapping word pairs contained matches to the PAC and
RRPE motifs, which were associated with genes that were
repressed in multiple stresses [30,38]. These motifs were
discovered by their enrichment among the approximately
600 genes that were commonly repressed in stress, yet the

Specific patterns of gene-expression changes are associated with templates. Conserved word-pair templates are shown with significant associations with
gene-expression changes in (a) multiple environmental stress conditions or (b) distinct subsets of environmental conditions. The P × C matrix of K-S pvalues was hierarchically clustered by rows and visualized with TreeView [52]. Each row corresponds to a conserved word-pair template, and each column
represents a single gene-expression experiment. The experimental conditions are indicated by the color bar above each panel, according to the key. The
value in each cell corresponds to the K-S p-value of gene-expression changes in each condition (column) for a group of genes that contain the conserved
word-pair template (row) in their TCRs. Orange denotes a K-S p-value below the FDR critical value of 0.001 for multiple testing, while gray represents
values that were not significant. Word pairs that failed to meet a FDR critical value of 0.001 for multiple testing in five or more experiments are not
shown. Some of the most significant conserved word-pair associations are labeled and annotated in Tables 1 and 2.

refereed research

Genes with a conserved half-site for the Hap1p transcription
factor, as well as a conserved Ecm22p/Upc2p binding site in
their TCRs, were significantly associated with induction in
the presence of drugs that inhibited ergosterol biosynthesis
(Figure 5b). This group of 30 genes contained eight ergosterol
biosynthesis genes; this proportion represented an enrichment compared to the rest of the genome (hypergeometric
p-value < 6 × 10-6 after Bonferroni correction for multiple
testing). The transcription factors Ecm22p and Upc2p have
been shown to induce the expression of ergosterol biosynthesis genes in response to low intracellular concentrations of
ergosterol, whereas Hap1p is known to regulate the expression of these genes according to the availability of heme and
oxygen, which are required for the pathway [43,44].

deposited research

Some groups of genes with shared word-pair templates were
enriched for known targets of transcription factors. The vast
majority of genes with conserved sites for both the Cbf1p and
Met31/32p transcription factors were induced more than
fourfold in cadmium, amino-acid starvation and early nitrogen depletion (Figure 5a). Half of these genes have confirmed
roles in sulfur-utilization processes, such as methionine
metabolism, sulfate assimilation, sulfate transport and sulfur
amino acid metabolism [42]. Compared to the rest of the
genome, the group of genes that conserved both of these
words within their TCRs was highly enriched for sulfur-utilization genes (hypergeometric p-value < 1 × 10-16, after
Bonferroni correction for multiple testing). In addition, we
found three genes in this group (GSH1, RAD59 and BNA3)
with highly correlated expression under the above conditions,
and thus may be commonly regulated by Cbf1p and Met31/
32p, despite their lack of direct annotation as sulfur-utilization genes. The shared conservation of both the Cbf1p and
Met31/32p sites provides further evidence that these genes
comprise part of the cellular response to the demand for
products of this pathway.

reports

Several groups of conserved word-pair templates only
showed significant associations with gene expression changes
in different subsets of stress conditions (Figure 4b, Tables 1,
2). For example, binding sites for Cbf1p and Met31/32p were
found to co-occur in several conserved word-pair templates.
Genes that contained conserved binding sites for these transcription factors in their TCRs were strongly induced in cadmium, amino-acid starvation and early nitrogen depletion.
These conditions are consistent with the biological activity of
these transcription factors, which induce transcription of sulfur-assimilation genes in response to the demand of sulfurcontaining metabolites [5,39,40]. In another example, several word pairs comprising binding sites for the transcriptional repressors Mig1p and Ume6p were associated with
induced gene expression in stationary phase. The observed
derepression of Mig1p and Ume6p targets in stationary phase
is consistent with the nuclear export of the Mig1p repressor
under glucose limitation, as well as recent findings that carbon source genes can be Ume6p targets [41]. In addition,
genes containing a conserved sequence similar to the consensus for Msn2/4p, an inducer of the environmental stress
response, and the heat-shock transcription factor Hsf1p were
significantly induced under heat shock. Once again, the

conditions with most significant gene-expression changes
corresponded to the known activities of the transcription factors involved.

reviews

putative transcription factors that bind these sequences have
yet to be determined. The second largest group of overlapping
word pairs corresponded to the RRPE core, which is 10
nucleotides long, along with some flanking conserved bases.
These repressed genes were enriched for rRNA processing
genes, the group of genes in which this motif was originally
identified [38]. Nine conserved word-pair templates
contained sequences that matched most of the stress
response element (STRE), the consensus site for the general
stress transcription factors Msn2p/Msn4p. Genes that conserved both these words in their TCRs were significantly associated with gene-expression induction in multiple
environmental stresses, including cadmium, heat shock,
amino-acid starvation, nitrogen depletion and stationary
phase. In most cases, the sequences comprising the word
pairs were mutually overlapping. We interpret these
sequences as representing different halves of the same binding site. Because our test for close spacing required non-overlapping sequences, the two words must have appeared over 6
bp away in TCRs. Thus, these genes have probably conserved
at least two Msn2/4p-like consensus sequences in their TCRs.

comment

The output P × C matrix of word pairs (P) that were significantly associated (p < 0.001) with at least five or more environmental conditions (C) was
ordered using hierarchical clustering. Numbers correspond to groups of overlapping word pairs indicated in Figure 4. Asterisks denote sequence
pairs whose involvement in multifactorial regulation has not been previously reported. Compiled sequences were assembled from groups of word
pairs that were found in adjacent rows in the ordering of K-S p-values. As individual words must have passed all three statistical tests to be included
in the output matrix, these consensus sequences may not reflect the actual biological specificities of conserved transcription factor binding sites
(refer to [26,36] for a more complete list). Residues are shown in bold if they are invariant in at least two hexamers. Numbers denote the groups
that are indicated in Figure 4. Multiple transcription factors that may bind the same sequence motif are separated by |. IUPAC codes used: K (G or
T); M (A or C); R (A or G); S (C or G); W (A or T).

Statistics are listed for one representative word pair for each group of overlapping word pairs, numbered as in Figure 4. Multiple transcription factors
¯
that may bind the same sequence motif are separated by |. To summarize the close spacing ( D ) between conserved word pairs, we report the
median of the distribution of minimum distances in S. cerevisiae ± standard deviation of the medians of the distribution of minimum distances in all
four Saccharomyces genomes.

Conserved word pairs were more informative than
sequence features derived from single words or single
species
The above results from the K-S test strongly suggested that
sequence features based on the co-conservation and close
spacing of word pairs identified examples of multifactorial

regulation. Two other statistical tests were also performed to
examine how information contained in conserved word-pair
templates compared to other sequence features derived from
S. cerevisiae, or from single conserved words. Informative
sequence features should be both highly specific (a high proportion of genes that share the feature should show gene-

Enrichment for known transcription factor targets among individual gene groups. Gene-expression patterns are shown for genes whose TCRs contain the
known binding sites for: (a) Cbf1p (CACGTG) and Met31/32p (TGTGGC); or (b) Hap1p (CCGATA) and Ecm22p/Upc2p (TCGTTT). The genes are
listed in ascending order of minimum distance between the two conserved words in the corresponding TCRs of S. cerevisiae. Each row in these diagrams
represents a given gene's expression pattern under the conditions shown in each column: exposure to increasing concentrations of cadmium chloride
(from 0.05 mM to 0.4 mM); an amino-acid starvation timecourse; a nitrogen-source depletion timecourse [30]; and growth in the presence of drugs or
genetic alterations that inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis (erg3∆, itraconazole, erg28∆, overexpressed ERG11, erg2∆, tunicamycin, terbinafine, erg6∆,
overexpressed HMG2) [35]. A red color indicates that the gene's expression was induced under those conditions, while a green color indicates that the
gene was repressed under those conditions; black indicates no detectable change in expression, and gray indicates missing data. Gene names in purple
correspond to genes with confirmed roles in (a) sulfur utilization or (b) ergosterol biosynthesis; gene names in orange show highly correlated expression
patterns, despite their lack of annotation as sulfur-utilization genes. Arrows above the columns indicate conditions in which the displayed gene groups
show significant gene-expression changes according to the K-S test, FDR correction for multiple testing at a p-value of 0.001.

expression changes) and highly sensitive (most of the genes
that show gene-expression changes should also share the
feature).
To assess the specificity of a sequence feature in explaining
gene expression, we computed the average expression profile
for all genes that shared that feature. We expect that if a
sequence feature represented a transcription factor binding
site, genes containing that feature in their TCRs would be
induced (or repressed), on average, compared to all the genes
in the genome [27]. By comparing the average expression
profile derived from conserved word-pair templates with
average expression profiles derived from simpler sequence
features, we assessed how much information was obtained by
incorporating both the conservation and pairwise combination of sequences. For representative word pairs associated
with significant gene-expression changes in environmental
stress conditions, we compared the average expression profile
for: gene subsets that shared single words in S. cerevisiae;
gene subsets that conserved single words among multiple
genomes; and gene subsets that shared both words in S. cerevisiae (Figure 6 and see Additional data files). In general, the
average gene-expression profiles for conserved word pairs
were more significantly different from the average expression
of genes in the genome when either conservation or word
pairs was used as an additional criterion for gene selection. In
Figure 6, the last two rows for each word pair indicate the
average expression profiles for genes that shared both words
in S. cerevisiae, as well as the average expression profile for
genes that conserved both words in multiple genomes,
respectively. Strikingly, the consideration of word-pair
conservation yielded further increases in average geneexpression profiles compared to word pairs in S. cerevisiae
alone. Similar effects were observed for the PAC-RRPE and
the overlapping RRPE pairs associated with genes repressed
in the environmental stress response (see Additional data
files). Thus, conserved word-pair templates contained more
specific predictors of gene expression than comparable
sequence templates derived from S. cerevisiae alone.
To evaluate how well sequence features can explain gene
expression changes across the whole genome, several groups

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/7/R43

have constructed linear regression models using various
choices for features [18–21]. The R-square statistic of a
regression model indicates the percent of global variance that
can be explained using the sequence features in the model.
Models with better fits to the genome-wide expression data
would thus have greater R-square values. To assess the sensitivity of individual word pairs in explaining global gene
expression, we first constructed regression models using individual word pairs (see Materials and methods). We chose
three representative environmental conditions: amino-acid
starvation (30 min) [30]; stationary phase (10 h in YPD) [30];
and ergosterol inhibition (terbinafine) [35]. We constructed
regression models using counts of individual words in S. cerevisiae TCRs, or using counts of words that were conserved
among Saccharomyces TCRs. Sequence conservation
improved the fit of regression models based on individual
word pairs (∆R2 = 0.3-1.3%) (see Additional data files). These
results clearly show that sequences conserved in multiple
Saccharomyces species were more likely to be associated
with gene-expression changes.
To assess the joint contribution of word pairs on gene expression, we also included interaction terms between the individual words only if their coefficients were statistically
significant (see Materials and methods). Pairwise interaction
terms, expressed as the product of scores for two features,
represent a standard way to assess whether two features contribute nonadditively to gene expression [19]. Indeed, the
inclusion of significant pairwise interaction terms improved
the fits for both the S. cerevisiae sequence model and the conserved sequence model, increasing the R-square by a further
0.2% to 0.9% (see Additional data files). Whereas the interaction terms only comprise a small proportion of the global
variance, they can be interpreted as statistical evidence of
dependence between sequence features [19]. Therefore, the
nonadditive contributions of conserved word-pair templates
further suggest their involvement in multifactorial
regulation.
We expanded these models to include multiple conserved
word-pair templates using a stepwise linear regression procedure. The set of potential sequence features was expanded to

Figure 6 (see following page)
Incorporation of conservation and word pairs provided more informative average expression profiles. Groups of genes whose TCRs contained various
sequence features were summarized by the average of their gene-expression profiles. Each row in these diagrams represents a given gene group's average
expression pattern under the conditions shown in each column: exposure to increasing concentrations of cadmium chloride (from 0.05 mM to 0.4 mM);
20 min after heat shock to 37°C (from 17°C, 21°C, 25°C, 29°C, and 33°C); an amino-acid starvation time course; a nitrogen-source depletion time
course; progression into stationary phase (2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 10 h, 12 h, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 5 days of growth) [30]. Representative conserved word-pair
templates were chosen for analysis, corresponding to: (a) Msn2/4p-like sequences (CTCCCC and CCCTTA); (b) Cbf1p (CACGTG) and Met31/32p
(TGTGGC) binding sites; (c) Mig1p (ACCCCA) and Ume6 (CCGCCG) binding sites; (d) Msn2/4p-like (CCCCTT) and Hsf1p-like (GAGAAA) sequences.
For each of the panels (a-d) each row represents the average expression profile for gene groups chosen by different sequence features in their TCRs:
single words found in S. cerevisiae (rows 1 and 2); single words conserved in three or more Saccharomyces genomes (rows 3 and 4); word pairs found in S.
cerevisiae (row 5); word pairs conserved in three or more Saccharomyces genomes (row 6). Arrows above the columns indicate conditions under which
gene groups sharing the conserved word-pair template (row 6) were significantly associated with gene-expression changes, at a p-value of 0.001 (K-S test
after FDR correction for multiple testing).

Words and pairwise interaction terms are reported in the order of selection by the stepwise linear regression procedure performed on conserved
words. The influence terms (Mf), associated p-values, and increase in R-square values were computed using the statistical package R [51]. Wang et al.
[20] and Conlon et al. [21] previously fit regression models using sequence features derived from S. cerevisiae. The p-values of the most similar
sequences features in their regression models were reported where available; sequence features that were more significant in this analysis are
indicated in bold. Dashes indicate sequence features that were insignificant in the Wang et al. [20] or Conlon et al. [21] analyses. 'N/R' indicates geneexpression data that were not analyzed by Conlon et al. [21]

include all words found in templates associated with significant gene expression changes in that condition, as assessed
previously by the K-S test (see Materials and methods). The
final R-square values for regression models based on occurrences of multiple words in S. cerevisiae ranged from 7.2% to
9.3% (Table 3 and see Additional data files). Once again, the

use of conserved instances of individual words yielded better
model fits, with improvements in R-square values from 3.1%
to 9.5%. Further improvements in the model fit (∆R2 = 0.5%
to 1.4%) were obtained using pairwise interaction terms
between individual words found in the same word-pair template. The total R-square values for the regression models

information

A key limitation of our approach is the use of hexamers, which
may fail to capture known binding sites. For example, the
binding sites for Mcm1p and Rap1p are poorly modeled by
exact words, in that these transcription factors bind
sequences with relaxed specificity at certain positions [11].

interactions

Another possible regulatory scheme for conserved, closely
spaced word pairs is that individual sequences found in
templates may correspond to binding sites for transcription
factors that bind independently under the same or separate
conditions. The Msn2/4p and Hsf1p transcription factors,
whose binding sites were similar to words identified in a template, represent an example of multifactorial regulation in
response to distinct environmental stimuli [6]. Spacing
constraints between their binding sites could nevertheless be
important under conditions when both factors are active.

refereed research

Conserved word-pair templates may be consistent with several underlying biochemical mechanisms. One possible interpretation of templates is that closely spaced sequence pairs
may promote direct or indirect interactions between
transcription factors by increasing the local concentrations of
the individual factors. For example, the proximity of Cbf1p
and Met31/32p binding sites may promote interaction
between these factors in recruiting their common transcriptional activators, Met4p and Met28p. Experimental studies
on the TCRs of MET3 and MET28 have demonstrated that the
binding of Cbf1p enhances the DNA-binding affinity of
Met31/32p [5]. Indeed, biochemical experiments suggest that
all these proteins may interact at the TCRs of some sulfur-utilization genes [5].

Direct biological models of binding-site organization in TCRs,
as exemplified by conserved word-pair templates, provided
several advantages over naive statistical models based on
sequence combinations in S. cerevisiae. Average geneexpression profiles showed that conserved word pairs were
more specific predictors of gene expression (giving fewer false
positives) than single or pairwise sequences derived from S.
cerevisiae, indicating that conserved regions among these
closely related Saccharomyces species were enriched for
functional sequences. The consideration of distance constraints between pairs of conserved sequences found many
more examples than a previous study of binding-site clustering for multiple transcription factors in S. cerevisiae [22]. In
addition, we discovered new sequences and pairwise interaction terms using regression models similar to those reported
in [20] and [21] (Table 3). Conserved word-pair templates
accounted for similar changes in genome-wide expression
(R-square from approximately 11% to approximately 20%)
using only 8 to 10 features, compared with dozens of overlapping features used by other methods [20,21]. Therefore,
individual features from our methods were more predictive of
genome-wide expression changes.

deposited research

Close spacing between word pairs may be important for reasons other than the promotion of transcription factor interactions. Different regions of TCRs at varying windows away
from translation start sites may be more competent at recruiting or inhibiting RNA polymerase. These differences may be
influenced by nucleosome accessibility, chromatin structure
or DNA physical properties, which can be correlated with
local A+T content (see [45] for references). Notably, we have
also found that the relative proportions of A and T nucleotides
vary considerably within the 200 bp closest to translation
start sites (A.M. Moses, M.B.Eisen and Audrey Gasch, unpublished results). Low-complexity words that contained four or
more As or Ts could be found in many templates (denoted by
TnC in Figure 4 and Table 1); these words may serve as
surrogates for a distance window from the translation start.
Binding sites that are close to these low-complexity words
may be found in more transcriptionally competent regions of
TCRs. Alternatively, the possibility that each word in an identified pair may be found at similar distances from a third conserved sequence element in all TCRs cannot be discounted.

This work describes two principles for analyzing combinations of regulatory sequences. First, sequence conservation
among closely related yeast species was used to find
sequences that were more likely to be functionally important.
Second, a template approach that considered joint positional
distributions of word pairs increased the specificity of geneexpression predictions using sequence-based rules. We have
demonstrated that higher-order sequence features within
TCRs were conserved across multiple Saccharomyces
genomes. Closely spaced and jointly conserved word pairs
were also more likely to be associated with specific geneexpression changes. A large proportion of words contained in
templates matched known transcription factor binding sites.
In many cases, associations between templates and geneexpression changes were significant in conditions when the
corresponding transcription factors are known to be active. In
addition, groups of genes that co-conserved both words in a
template often were enriched for common functional roles.
These results suggest that conserved word-pair templates,
which were discovered strictly on the basis of higher-order
properties of sequence conservation, also carry biological
relevance.

Discussion

reviews

Recent experiments have suggested that transcription factors
that do not physically interact may still co-activate gene
expression as long as their binding sites are spaced within a
nucleosome length (approximately 150 bp), due to collaborative competition of the bound transcription factors with core
histones [8].

comment

based on conserved word-pair templates with interaction
terms thus ranged from 10.8% to 20.2% (Table 3). Thus,
sequence features based on conserved word-pair templates
could explain more of the global gene expression changes
than features based on S. cerevisiae alone.

Our method missed examples of multifactorial regulation
involving Mcm1p or Rap1p that were suggested by previous
work using position-weight matrices [17]. In addition, our
method required sequence identity for a word to be labeled as
conserved. This strict requirement omitted binding sites that
may have retained their function, despite mutations in degenerate positions that may have little impact on transcription
factor binding. This tradeoff between enumerating all possible words and capturing degenerate positions in binding sites
was compounded by the very large number of pairwise word
combinations that were enumerated. Further work should
incorporate more complicated sequence models, as well as
optimization methods that restrict the search space of
sequence combinations.
The consideration of joint conservation and close spacing has
provided insights into how TCR organization may influence
the multifactorial regulation of gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These criteria were motivated by experimental studies on the positional organization of individual
binding sites within TCRs, with the hypothesis that this
underlying architecture would be functionally conserved.
Even more complicated higher-order sequence rules are
apparent in the organization of cis-regulatory modules in
Drosophila melanogaster [46]. Nevertheless, a common
organizational theme of the TCRs in both of these organisms
is the importance of relative spacing between transcription
factor binding sites. The discovery of additional principles for
TCR organization will further advance our understanding of
how regulatory information is encoded in genome sequences.

Materials and methods
Datasets
Whole-genome shotgun sequencing of Saccharomyces bayanus, S. mikatae, and S. paradoxus has been previously
described [26]. All are highly related to S. cerevisiae, as they
are grouped within the sensu stricto branch of the Saccharomyces genus [28]. Intergenic regions were aligned using
CLUSTALW as described [26] and are available from the
Yeast Comparative Genomics website [42]. A total of 4,101
CLUSTALW alignments were analyzed. These alignments
were filtered for orthologs in at least three genomes.
Gene-expression measurements were obtained from the
Stanford Microarray Database [47] and Rosetta [35]. The
main experimental types among the 342 conditions examined
include cell cycle [31,32], environmental stress response [30],
DNA damage [33,34], cadmium (N. Ogawa and P.O. Brown,
unpublished data), and inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis
[35]. This data has been log-transformed (base 2), and each
experimental condition has been median normalized.

Dependent conservation of word pairs
To assess whether two words were co-conserved in the same
intergenic regions, a chi-square test of independence was sys-

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/7/R43

tematically conducted for all possible words of length 6. We
defined a word to include a 6-bp sequence and its reverse
complement. Each transcriptional control region (TCR) for a
gene was defined as the 600 bp upstream of its translation
start site. TCRs shared between divergently transcribed genes
less than 600 bp long were only counted once. A word was
labeled conserved in a TCR if all six bases were identical
among at least three of the four genomes in the CLUSTALW
alignment. For each word pair (W, V) whose overlap was less
than 4, a contingency table Cwv was constructed. In this table,
Cwv = number of TCR(Iw∩Iv), where Iw, Iv are indicator variables for the presence of each conserved word in a TCR,
summed over all TCRs. TCRs shared between divergently
transcribed genes less than 600 bp long were only counted
once. The expected counts Ewv were obtained from an independence assumption; that is, the product of the individual
word conservation probabilities, multiplied by the total
number of TCRs. The chi-square statistic with Yates continuity correction was computed according to the definition:

Spatial proximity of constrained word pairs
The second requirement for a conserved sequence template
involved constraints on spatial arrangements between individual words. Any method that evaluates spacing distributions between word pairs must take into account positional
biases that may be present for individual words (A.M. Moses,
unpublished results). We used a permutation test to evaluate
the significance of the median of minimum distances, excluding overlaps, between conserved word pairs. By permuting
the TCR labels for one of the words, but not the word positions themselves, we retained the positional biases of individual words within intergenic regions. Within any given TCR t,
define pt(W) = {pt1(W), ..., ptj(W)} as a vector of positions in
S. cerevisiae where the j occurrences of word W are conserved. Suppose that words W and V were jointly conserved
in TCRs T1 ... TN. For each TCR t ∈ { T1 ... TN}, the minimum
distance between words W and V was computed as

mt = min ptj ( W ) − pt ( V ) .

word-pair template, or to all words found in conserved wordpair templates that were significantly associated with geneexpression changes in that condition. The score Sgf for feature f in a TCR corresponding to gene g was taken as either
the number of occurrences in S. cerevisiae, or the number of

centered Pearson correlation was used as the similarity

For each gene-expression condition c in our dataset, c ∈ {1,
..., 342}, we tested the null hypothesis that a gene subset Gwv
⊆ G selected by a conserved word pair (w, v) had the same
distribution of gene-expression ratios (Ewvc) as the entire
genome (Ec). The alternate hypothesis stated that the two
gene-expression distributions were significantly different.
Any gene was an element of Go if its corresponding TCR conserved both sequences in the word pair. Since the size No of
gene subsets may be small and the distributions may not be
normally distributed, we used the nonparametric K-S test.
The test statistic K compares the cumulative distribution
functions Fwvc and Fc corresponding to Ewvc and Ec by the
formula

We ensured that the K-S p-value for the conserved word-pair
subset Go was more significant than subsets Gw or Gv comprised of only one conserved word by computing K for Ewc vs
Evc, as well as for Ewc vs Ec. The marginal improvement of the
joint word pair was defined as: K(Foc vs Fc) - max(K(Fwc vs
Fc), K(Fvc vs Fc)).
