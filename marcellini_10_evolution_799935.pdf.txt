Abstract
Background: The mineralized skeleton is a major evolutionary novelty that has contributed to the impressive
morphological diversifications of the vertebrates. Essential to bone biology is the solidified extracellular matrix
secreted by highly specialized cells, the osteoblasts. We now have a rather complete view of the events underlying
osteogenesis, from a cellular, molecular, genetic, and epigenetic perspective. Because this knowledge is still largely
restricted to mammals, it is difficult, if not impossible, to deduce the evolutionary history of the regulatory network
involved in osteoblasts specification and differentiation. In this study, we focused on the transcriptional regulators
Runx2 and VDR (the Vitamin D Receptor) that, in mammals, directly interact together and stabilize complexes of
co-activators and chromatin remodellers, thereby allowing the transcriptional activation of target genes involved in
extracellular matrix mineralization. Using a combination of functional, biochemical, and histological approaches, we
have asked if the interaction observed between Runx2 and VDR represents a recent mammalian innovation, or if it
results from more ancient changes that have occurred deep in the vertebrate lineage.
Results: Using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in developing embryos of chick, frog and teleost
fishes, we have revealed that the co-expression of Runx2 and VDR in skeletal elements has been particularly
strengthened in the lineage leading to amniotes. We show that the teleost Runx2 orthologue as well as the three
mammalian Runx1, Runx2 and Runx3 paralogues are able to co-immunoprecipitate with the VDR protein present
in nuclear extracts of rat osteoblasts stimulated with 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. In addition, the teleost Runx2 can
activate the transcription of the mammalian osteocalcin promoter in transfection experiments, and this response
can be further enhanced by 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Finally, using pull-down experiments between
recombinant proteins, we show that the VDR homologue from teleosts, but not from ascidians, is able to directly
interact with the mammalian Runx2 homologue.
Conclusions: We propose an evolutionary scenario for the assembly of the molecular machinery involving Runx2
and VDR in vertebrates. In the last common ancestor of actinopterygians and sacropterygians, the three Runx
paralogues possessed the potential to physically and functionally interact with the VDR protein. Therefore, 1a,25dihydroxyvitamin D3 might have been able to modulate the transcriptional activity of Runx1, Runx2 or Runx3 in
the tissues expressing VDR. After the split from amphibians, in the lineage leading to amniotes, Runx2 and VDR
became robustly co-expressed in developing skeletal elements, and their regulatory interaction was incorporated in
the genetic program involved in the specification and differentiation of osteoblasts.

Background
The formation and maintenance of the skeleton involves
the specification and differentiation of specialized cell
types, such as the osteoblasts, chondrocytes and osteoclasts [1-3]. The osteoblasts, of mesenchymal origin, are
responsible for depositing the mineralized extracellular
matrix of the bones. Their proliferation, survival, and
physiology depend on a complex interplay between
intrinsic and extrinsic signals. For example, if osteoblasts
receive too few BMP signals, or if they fail to express
the Runx2 and osterix transcription factors, their ability
to differentiate into osteoblasts is largely compromised
or abolished [4-6]. Runx2 was the first transcription factor identified as being essential for osteoblastogenesis
[5,7]. It was later shown to act redundantly with its
paralogue Runx3 during chondrogenesis [8]. Runx2 can
either activate or repress transcription, depending on
the nature of its cofactors, and on the regulatory architecture of the target promoter [Reviewed in [9-11]].
Although Runx2 has mainly been studied in mammals,
we know that it is also expressed in chondrocytes and
osteoblasts during the skeletogenesis of birds, frogs, teleost fishes and sharks [12-17]. In addition, morpholino
knock-down approaches have demonstrated that Runx2
is required during chondrogenesis of Danio rerio and
Xenopus tropicalis [14,18]. Taken together, these studies
reveal a broad conservation of Runx2 function throughout osteichthyan vertebrates, a monophyletic group consisting of actinopterygians (such as teleost fishes) and
sarcopterygians (such as tetrapods)[19].
Mammalian osteoblast specification and differentiation
also rely on the activity of other transcription factors
such as the Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) that belongs to
the NR1I family of nuclear receptors [20,21]. The VDR
is required for normal bone formation and regulates the
transcription of target genes upon binding to its ligand,
the 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [22-25]. In the intestine,
VDR and 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 play a pivotal role
in the maintenance of bone mineralization and skeletal
development through the regulation of proper calcium
and phosphate absorption [26,27]. Importantly, the cellautonomous contribution of VDR to osteoblastic differentiation has been demonstrated by several additional
lines of evidence. First, the 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
enhances osteoblastic differentiation and stimulates the
expression of VDR target genes coding for bone matrix
components [28]. Second, osteoblasts express the Vitamin D receptor and also have the ability to synthesize
1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [24,29]. Third, cultures of
primary osteoblasts harvested from a VDR knock-out
mouse clearly exhibit a reduced mineralization potential
[30]. Finally, the direct binding of the VDR to the promoters of osteoblast-specific genes like osteocalcin (ocn)

Page 2 of 12

and bone sialoprotein (bsp) is required for chromatin
remodeling and transcriptional activation induced by
1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [31-33]. In this respect, it is
relevant to note that the direct protein-protein interaction between VDR and Runx2 stabilizes transcriptional
complexes at specific promoters, thereby contributing to
osteogenesis [32]. In summary, a variety of experiments
performed in adult tissues or in cell cultures have established VDR as an important osteoblast-specific transcription factor. However, the scarcity of developmental
data and comparative studies clearly impede our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms through which
VDR became incorporated in the vertebrate skeletogenic
regulatory network.
Indeed, changes in the regulatory interactions involved
in cell specification and differentiation lie at the heart of
the evolutionary process [34-36]. The functional experiments performed in mammalian osteoblasts have provided a detailed picture of the Runx2-dependent
regulatory network supporting skeletogenesis. They
revealed how the function of Runx2 is regulated at the
transcriptional and post-translational level, and how distinct inputs converge on the Runx2 target genes. Yet,
the lack of data from non-mammalian vertebrates renders difficult, if not impossible, to decipher how this
skeletogenetic regulatory network emerged and evolved.
In the present work, we focused our attention on a specific node of this complex network. In order to shed
light on the evolutionary origin of the Runx2-VDR physical and functional interaction in osteoblasts, we have
compared the function, the biochemical properties, and
the expression patterns of their homologues from distantly related chordates. Based on our results, we propose that the three Runx paralogues and VDR had the
potential to functionally and physically interact in the
last common ancestor of osteichthyans, and most probably did so in tissues where both proteins were
expressed, in the presence of 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3. After the split from amphibians, in the lineage leading to amniotes, Runx2 and VDR became robustly coexpressed in developing skeletal elements, and their
regulatory interaction was incorporated in the genetic
program involved in the specification and differentiation
of osteoblasts.

Results
Several studies performed in chondrichthyans and a
variety of osteichthyans have demonstrated that the
Runx2 expression in developing skeletal elements is
highly conserved [12-17]. The evolution of the VDR
expression pattern is, however, less clear. The VDR transcripts are known to be fairly ubiquitous in lamprey, teleost, and frog adult tissues analyzed by RT-PCR or

Northern blot [37]. Because few studies have described
the spatio-temporal expression pattern of VDR during
embryonic development [38], we decided to assess the
degree of co-expression of Runx2 and VDR during skeletogenesis of distantly related oteichthyan vertebrate
such as birds, amphibians and teleosts.
VDR is robustly co-expressed with Runx2 in the
osteoblastic lineage of amniotes but not of amphibians

The fact that cell cultures of chick calvaria show VDR
expression before the onset of typical osteoblastic markers suggests that VDR could be co-expressed with
Runx2 in the nuclei of osteoblastic precursors before
cell differentiation and matrix mineralization [39]. To
verify this possibility, we assessed the co-expression of
Runx2 and VDR in developing skeletal elements of Gallus gallus at embryonic day (E)7 (Fig. 1a). We detected
the VDR protein in the preosteoblastst present in the
perichondrium as well as in the striated muscles, a
situation reminiscent to what has been described in
mammals (Fig. 1b) [40]. Therefore, VDR seems to be
robustly expressed in the osteoblastic lineage of both
intramembraneous and endochondral chick bones. To
demonstrate the high degree of co-expression of the
VDR and Runx2 proteins, we examined double stainings
by confocal microscopy and observed that chick preosteoblasts are significantly enriched in both proteins (Fig.
1 e-h). We further show that in developing chick skeletal elements Runx2 is strictly nuclear, while the VDR
protein is evenly distributed in the cytoplasm and the
nucleus, as expected (Fig. 1 i-l).
Because birds are closely related to mammals, we next
whished to analyze the expression of VDR in a tertrapod
species that does not belong to the amniota. For this
purpose, we analyzed endochondral bone of the amphibian Xenopus tropicalis at stage NF58 (Fig. 1c). Immunohistochemical staining revealed a strong expression in
the hindlimb skeletal muscles, showing that the VDRspecific antibody can efficiently recognize the Xenopus
epitope (Fig. 1d). However, in sharp contrast with the
situation observed with chick embryos, no specific signal
could be observed in differentiating osteoblasts of the
periosteum (Fig. 1d). Although we cannot rule out the
possibility that the VDR is expressed below detection
level in frog osteoblasts, the strong positive reaction the
skeletal muscle of Gallus and Xenopus supports the idea
that, in amphibians, the VDR protein is not present in
developing endochondral bones (compare Fig. 1b and
1d). Because the presence of mRNA coding for Runx2
has already been demonstrated in the perichondrium
and periosteum of several amphibian species [15,41,42],
the absence of VDR in these tissues rules out the possibility of a functional interaction between the two
proteins.

The teleost VDR and Runx2 are co-expressed in some
skeletal elements

In order to examine if Runx2 and VDR are co-expressed to
some degree in developing skeletal elements of teleosts, we
analyzed embryos from Danio rerio (Fig. 2). We first used
RT-PCR to describe the temporal expression pattern of
the Danio VDR gene, and revealed a maternal expression,
the absence of transcripts in 24 hours post fertilization
(hpf) larvae, and the presence of zygotic transcripts from
48 hpf onward (Fig. 2e). We next compared the expression
pattern of Runx2 and VDR in 72 hpf larvae because at this
stage both genes are expressed, and skeletal elements are
actively developing [43,44]. As a result of a genomic duplication event that occurred in the teleost lineage, Danio
rerio possesses two highly conserved Runx2 paralogues,
named Runx2a and Runx2b [12]. We employed an in situ
hybridization probe containing the complete open reading
frame of Runx2b that is likely to also anneal to Runx2a
transcripts [12]. In this respect, it is important to stress
out that at 72 hpf the expression pattern of Runx2a only
represents a fraction of the Runx2b positive cells [12]. We
found that the expression patterns of Runx2b and VDR
differed in several respects. For instance, at this stage (72
hpf), Runx2b but not VDR transcripts are detected in the
cleithrum, the fourth and fith branchial arches and quadrate (Fig. 2). Conversely, VDR but not Runx2b transcripts
are detected in the inner plexiform layer (eye) and ventricle (heart) (Fig. 2). Most importantly, we also detected the
presence of both mRNAs in several bones of the skull,
such as the Meckel Cartilage (Lower Jaw), parasphenoid,
palatoquadrate (Upper Jaw), and operculum (Fig. 2).
Altogether, these results reveal a clear difference
between amniotes and other vertebrate species. While
birds and mammals consistently show a robust co-localization of Runx2 and VDR in cells of the osteoblast
lineage, these two proteins do not seem to be coexpressed in amphibian long bones, and the Runx2 and
VDR transcripts only partially overlap in skeletal elements of teleost fishes.
The teleost Runx2b interacts with the 1a,25dihydroxyvitamin D3 signaling pathway in mammalian
osteoblasts

The co-expression of VDR and Runx2 homologues in
some skeletal elements of teleost embryos raises the
possibility that Danio rerio Runx2 protein can functionally interact with the 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 signaling pathway in differentiating osteoblasts. Hence, we
asked if the transcriptional activity of a teleost Runx2
homologue is sensitive to 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
For this purpose, we used cultures of the rat ROS17/2.8
osteoblastic cell line known to increase the expression
of osteoblast-specific genes in response to 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 . In these cells, the ocn promoter

directly responds to the mammalian Runx2 protein, and
this induction is further increased by the addition of
1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [32]. We found that the
overexpression of the Danio rerio Runx2b stimulates the
expression of a mammalian ocn reporter gene (1.5 fold
increase), a response that is further enhanced by 1a,25dihydroxyvitamin D3 treatment (2 fold increase, see Fig.
3a, b). The magnitude of this effect was similar to

control transfections performed in parallel with the
mouse Runx2 homologue (not shown). This functional
interaction suggests that the exogenous teleost Runx2b
protein can physically interact with VDR-containing
macromolecular complexes regulating the transcription
of osteoblast-specific target genes. In agreement with
this idea, we found that a GST fusion form of the Danio
rerio Runx2b orthologue is able to interact with the

proteins were then detected by Western blotting. The migration of molecular weight standards is indicated on the left.

endogenous mammalian VDR obtained from nuclear
extracts of immortalized rat osteoblasts (Fig. 3c). Likewise, in this assay, the three mammalian Runx paralogues are able to interact with VDR (Fig. 3c).
The direct Runx2-VDR interaction is conserved between
mammals and teleosts but not between mammals and
tunicates

We subsequently used GST-pull down between purified recombinant proteins to assay the degree of evolutionary conservation of the direct physical interaction
previously described between the mammalian Runx2
and VDR [32]. As shown on fig. 4a, the GST-Runx2
proteins from teleosts or mammals can interact, albeit
weakly, with the mammalian VDR in vitro. We interpret the weak interaction in vitro as the requirement
of additional cofactors, such as P300 or SRC1, that
form macromolecular complexes with the Runx2 and
VDR proteins bound to their native target genes
[22,32]. Hence, this result supports the idea that the
ability of Runx2 to directly interact with a mammalian
VDR is well conserved between distantly related
osteichthyan vertebrates. To verify if, reciprocally, the
teleost VDR protein also bears the ability to directly
recognize various Runx2 homologues, we produced a
recombinant form of the Danio rerio VDR homologue.
In GST pull down assays, the Danio VDR protein is
able to recognize the Runx2 homologues from mammals and teleosts, thereby confirming that the direct
Runx2-VDR interaction was possible in the ancestral
osteichthyan vertebrate (Fig. 4b). Finally, to assess if
the interaction between VDR and Runx homologues is
shared with invertebrates, we used an outgroup nuclear
receptor from the tunicate Ciona intestinalis that is
most closely related to the vertebrate VDR [hereafter
referred to as Ci-VDR, see [20,21,45]]. Ci-VDR is
unable to interact with the mammalian GST-Runx2
protein (Fig. 4c). Lowering the stringency of the reaction buffer did not result in any detectable interaction
(not shown). Taken together, these findings suggest
that the Runx2-VDR interaction is highly conserved
between osteichthyan species, but that the invertebrate
VDR orthologues are too divergent to be able to interact with vertebrate Runx2 proteins.

Discussion
With a few recent exceptions, most of our knowledge
regarding the genetic basis of osteoblast specification
and differentiation comes from experiments performed
in mammals [3,11,46-48]. In the present study, we investigated the evolutionary origin of one component of the
regulatory network involved in osteogenesis: the functional and physical interaction between the Runx2 and
VDR transcription factors [32].

Figure 4 The Runx-VDR interaction is well conserved between
osteichthyan vertebrate species. GST or the indicated GST-Runx2
fusion proteins (1.5 μg) previously bound to 20 μl of glutathioneSepharose beads were incubated with the recombinant VDR
homologue from Homo sapiens (A) or Danio rerio (B). The Danio
rerio VDR protein is not recognized by the anti-VDR antibody (not
shown) and was therefore tagged with an N-terminal Myc epitope.
Precipitated VDR (upper panel) and GST-Runx2 (lower panel)
proteins were then detected by Western blotting. (C) The

GST-Runx2 (lower panel) proteins were then detected by Western
blotting. Abbreviations: Dr, Danio rerio; Mm, Mus musculus; Hs, Homo

Expression analysis revealed a clear difference between
amniotes and non-amniote vertebrates. While Runx2
and VDR are robustly co-expressed in nuclei of the
osteoblastic lineage of mammals [32] and birds (this
study), we found that the two proteins are unlikely to be
co-expressed in amphibians and only partially overlap in
skeletal elements of teleosts. This observation suggests a
relatively recent recruitment of the VDR in the bones of
amniotes representative (Fig. 5). Hence, although all vertebrate species possess morphologically similar cells
named osteoblasts, important regulatory differences
might progressively evolve in specific lineages and modify the transcriptional network controlling the specification and differentiation of this cell type. From our
results it is tempting to propose that the VDR plays a
direct, cell autonomous, role in all osteoblasts of
amniotes, but not in amphibians (Fig. 5). In Danio rerio,
1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 increases mineralization
[49]. Our results suggest that this hormone regulates
bone mineralization indirectly (via the control of calcium and phosphate homeostasis in intestinal cells), but
also cell-autonomously, in the osteoblasts of the specific
skeletal elements where Runx2 and VDR are coexpressed (e.g. the parasphenoid and the operculum). A
broader sampling of actinopterygian, sacrcopterygian as
well as chondrichthyan species would provide valuable
information regarding this issue.
Using in vitro GST pull-down assays, we observed that
the mammalian and teleost VDR proteins can interact
with various Runx homologues. In particular, the interaction is conserved with the two mammalian paralogues
(Runx1 and Runx3) and with the teleost orthologue
(Danio rerio Runx2). These experiments reveal that the
interaction domains between the ancestral VDR and
Runx proteins were already compatible in the last common ancestor of all osteichthyan vertebrates, and have
remained well conserved. In agreement with these data,
we confirmed that the Runx2b protein from teleosts is
functional in mammalian osteoblastic cells and can be
further stimulated by the addition of the VDR ligand.
These results suggest that this hormone can stabilize
Runx2-VDR complexes on the promoter of specific target genes in teleost osteoblasts.
We failed to detect an interaction between the VDR
homologue from tunicates and a vertebrate Runx2
orthologue. In this regard, it is relevant to point out that
the Ci-VDR transcription factor differs from its vertebrate homologues in many other respects, as it is unable
to activate reporter genes and to interact with 1a,25dihydroxyvitamin D3 [21,45,50,51]. Hence, after the split
from tunicates, the ancestral vertebrate VDR underwent
dramatic structural modifications, both in the C-terminal ligand-binding domain [21,51] and in the Runx2binding domain mapped to the N-terminal region [32].

Page 8 of 12

It is possible, but unproven, that the Runx and VDR
orthologues are undergoing a constant co-evolutionary
process and interact together in tunicates (Fig. 5).
In sharp contrast with the highly conserved skeletonspecific expression of Runx2, the transcripts and protein
product of the VDR gene are detected in a broad variety
of lamprey, teleost and amphibian adult organs
[37,38,45,50]. One might stipulate that the functional
cooperation observed between VDR and Runx2 can be
extended to the other vertebrate Runx paralogues that
are co-expressed with the VDR. Therefore, in addition
to osteoblasts, it is possible that 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3 signaling directly integrates the Runx-dependent regulatory networks involved in the specification of many
vertebrate tissues where VDR is co-expressed with
Runx1 or Runx3. Indeed, the fairly ubiquitous expression of the VDR might have increased its chances of
being co-expressed with (and to interact with) any of
the three Runx paralogues. In this respect, it is interesting to correlate the expression of Runx and VDR homologues in endodermal tissues. On the one hand, Runx
orthologues of nematode, sea urchin, amphioxus and
mammals (Runx3) are expressed in the gut [52-55], suggesting an ancient endodermal expression inherited
from the urbilateria. On the other hand, VDR is
expressed in the intestine of teleosts [37], lampreys [45],
frogs [50], birds [56] and mammals [57]. It is tempting
to propose that shortly after its emergence, the VDR
protein was co-expressed in the gut with Runx3 (Fig. 5).
Once the first Runx-VDR regulatory interaction established, it would have been free to spread to the other
Runx transcription factors and their tissue-specific target
genes by exaptation and regulatory rewiring [58,59].

Conclusions
In summary, we propose that the molecular machinery
involving Runx2 and VDR in osteoblastic cells exists at
least since the emergence of the osteichthyans, but has
subsequently been strengthened in the lineage leading to
amniotes. The widespread VDR distribution might have
facilitated the co-expression with the Runx paralogues,
and contributed to the emergence of the Runx-VDR
physical and functional interaction in a variety of tissues.
Osteoblasts from distantly-related vertebrate species
secrete mineralized matrix and exhibit a similar morphology [60]. Yet, in spite of these shared characters,
genomic turnover continuously creates, eliminates and
modifies genes coding for bone matrix proteins, a phenomenon called phenogenetic drift [61]. Our results
suggest that, likewise, the osteoblast-specific regulatory
network has steadily been evolving during the vertebrate
radiations. Although the essential Runx2-dependent regulatory kernel has remained highly conserved, it should
not come as a surprise if, between species,

might represent an ancestral, gut-specific, regulatory module. The physical and functional interaction between Runx2 (R2) and VDR probably
plays a minor role during osteichthyan skeletogenesis (i.e. only in some species or in a subset of skeletal elements). We propose here that it was
particularly strengthened in amniotes, once the VDR became robustly expressed in osteoblasts.

osteoblastogenesis is modulated by a plethora of different transcription factors, signaling pathways, and
ligands, such as the 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.

Methods
Immunohistochemistry

Gallus gallus E7 and Xenopus tropicalis stage 58 [62]
hindlimbs were dissected out and fixed for three days in
Bouin (14 volumes of picric acid, 5 volumes of formaldehyde 37% and 1 volume of glacial acetic acid). Samples were subsequently embedded in paraffin, sectioned
at a seven micrometer thickness, mounted on glass

slides and stained following a classical hematoxylin
eosin procedure. For immunohistochemistry, hindlimbs
from Gallus gallus E7 embryos and from Xenopus tropicalis stage 58 tadpoles were removed, mounted in OCT
(Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA, USA) and quickly frozen
in isopentane cooled with liquid nitrogen, as described
[63]. Cryosections (20 micrometer) were immunostained
with primary antibodies diluted 1:100 in blocking solution (1% BSA in Dulbecco’s phosphate buffer saline;
D-PBS) 12-15 h at 4°C. Antibodies were C-20 (rabbit
polyclonal anti-rat VDR, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and
a mouse monoclonal anti-Runx2, kindly provided by the

laboratory of Dr. Gary Stein. Control experiments performed in the absence of primary antibodies gave negative results (not shown). Corresponding alexa488 and
alexa546-conjugated secondary immunoglobulins (Invitrogen) were incubated for 2 h at RT. Nuclei cells were
counterstained with TO-PRO-3 iodide (Invitrogen).
Samples were subsequently mounted with aqueous medium for fluorescence (Sigma). Images were acquired
with a laser confocal Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U
microscope.
In situ hybridization and RT-PCR on Danio rerio embryos

Danio rerio embryos were raised at 28°C and fixed for in
situ hybridization in 4% paraformaldehyde. Hybridization reactions were performed as previously described
[64]. The Danio rerio VDR probe covered the region
coding for the ligand binding domain [65]. Embryos
were mounted in glycerol, observed under a Leica
MZ12.5 stereomicroscope and photographs were taken
with a Leica DC300F digital camera.
The mRNA for expression studies was extracted from
embryos or larvae at different stages of development (0,
24, 48 and 72 hpf) using the Trizol Reagent according
to the manufacturer’s indications (Invitrogen). Reverse
transcription was performed with the SuperScript II
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. As an internal control, we used b-actin primers:
Forward 5’-TTC TGG TCG GTA CTA CTG GTA TTG
TG-3’ and reverse 5’-ATC TTC ATC AGG TA- GTC
TGT CAG GT-3’. The sequences of the VDR primers
were as follow: Forward 5’-TCA CTG ATG GAT CTG
ATG GC-3’ and reverse 5’-CTG AAT CTG ACG AAG
TCG GA-3’.
Transfection and luciferase assay

The rat ROS 17/2.8 osteoblastic cells were cultured as
described previously [32]. Cells were plated in 24-well
plates and transiently transfected with the Rattus norgevicus osteocalcin-luciferase reporter (pOC-LUC, 50 ng/
well), the renilla internal control (pSV40-renilla, 2.5 ng/
well) and a Myc tagged version of the full length Danio
rerio Runx2 open reading frame under the control of the
CMV promoter (100 ng/well). The total amount of transfected DNA was maintained at 650 ng/well with pBluescript. ROS 17/2.8 cells were transfected with
Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Six hours after transfection,
1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was added to the medium at
a final concentration of 10-8 M. Cells were harvested 24 h
after transfection and assayed for Luciferase and Renilla
activity using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) in a
TD20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). The efficiency
of the overexpression was verified by Western blots on
nuclear extracts prepared from transfected cells.

GST-pull down assays

The proteins containing the N-terminal glutathione Stransferase (GST) fused in frame to the Runx homologues were obtained by expression in Escherichia coli
BL21 strain as previously reported [32]. GST-free proteins were obtained by cleaving GST-VDR or GSTRunx2 orthologues with 25 U of Thrombin (Amersham
Biosciences) at 4°C overnight. Nuclear extracts were prepared from 15 plates of confluent ROS 17/8.2 previously
treated with 10-8 M 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 for 18
h. The plates were placed on ice for 10 min, and then
washed with 10 ml of cold PBS. Cells were collected
with a scrapper in 15 ml of cold PBS with Complete
protease inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), and centrifuged at
2000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The Cells were resuspended
and incubated on ice for 5 min in 5 volumes of pellet
equivalent of buffer A (10 mM HEPES pH7,9; 1,5 mM
MgCl2; 10 mM KCl; 1 mM DTT and 1× Protease inhibitor). Cells were lysed using a Dounce homogenizer
and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. Pelleted
nuclei were washed with 5 ml of cold buffer A, centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, resuspended in
100 μL of cold buffer C (20 mM HEPES pH7,9; 1,5 mM
MgCl2; 420 mM KCl; 0,2 mM EDTA; 1 mM DTT; 1×
Complete Protease inhibitor), and incubated for 1 h at
4°C with gentle agitation. After centrifuging at 12 500
rpm for 15 min at 4°C the supernatant (nuclear extracts)
was collected, quantified using a classical Bradford assay,
and rapidly frozen with 25% glycerol. The GST-pull
down assays were performed with 25 μl of Glutation
Sepharose resin (Pharmacia Biotechnologies). 1 μg of
GST, Runx2-GST (or VDR-GST) fusion proteins were
incubated in 400 μl of binding buffer (20 mM Tris pH
8.0, 100 mM KCl, 0.5% NP-40, 10 mM EDTA, 0.05 mM
PMSF, 1 mM DTT) for 30 min at 4°C with gentle agitation. 1.5 μg of pure recombinant VDR (or Runx2) proteins were added in a final volume of 500 μL of the
binding buffer containing 0.5% of non-fat milk, and
were subsequently incubated for 2 h at 4°C with gentle
agitation. The reactions were washed four times with
500 μL binding buffer for 5 min at 4°C. After the last
centrifugation, the resin was resuspended in loading buffer (100 mM Tris-Cl pH 6.8, 4% p/v SDS, 0.15% v/v
bromofenol blue, 20% v/v glycerol, 200 mM DTT) and
incubated for 5 min at 95°C. The proteins that were
retained with the resin were run in a 10% acrylamide
SDS-PAGE and revealed by Western blotting with specific antibodies against VDR (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), GST (Pharmacia Biotech) and cMyc (9E10,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The accession numbers of
the cDNAs coding for the proteins used in this study
are: Homo sapiens Runx1 (NM_001754), Mus musculus
Runx2 (NM_004348), Homo sapiens Runx3
(NM_004350.2), Danio rerio Runx2 (AY443097), Homo

sapiens VDR (NM_000376) and Ciona intestinalis VDRPXR homologue (AB210742). The Danio rerio full
length VDR clone was reconstituted by PCR using overlapping 5’ and 3’ regions as templates. The 3’ region
corresponded to the ligand binding domain [described
in [65]]. The 5’ region coding for the DNA binding
domain was obtained by RT-PCR using 72 hpf cDNA as
a template (forward primer 5’-TCA CTG ATG GAT
CTG ATG GC-3’ and reverse primer 5’-CTG AAT CTG
ACG AAG TCG GA-3’).
