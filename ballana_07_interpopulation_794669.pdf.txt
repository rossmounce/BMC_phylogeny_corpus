Abstract
Background: Copy number variants (CNVs) account for a significant proportion of normal
phenotypic variation and may have an important role in human pathological variation. The αdefensin cluster on human chromosome 8p23.1 is one of the better-characterized CNVs, in which
high copy number variability affecting the DEFA1 and DEFA3 genes has been reported. Moreover,
the DEFA3 gene has been found to be absent in a significant proportion of control population
subjects. CNVs involving immune genes, such as α-defensins, are possibly contributing to innate
immunity differences observed between individuals and influence predisposition and susceptibility
to disease.
Results: We have tested the DEFA3 absence in 697 samples from different human populations. The
proportion of subjects lacking DEFA3 has been found to vary from 10% to 37%, depending on the
population tested, suggesting differences in innate immune function between populations. Absence
of DEFA3 was correlated with the region's haplotype block structure. African samples showed a
higher intra-populational variability together with the highest proportion of subjects without DEFA3
(37%). Association analysis of DEFA3 absence with 136 SNPs from a 100-kb region identified a
conserved haplotype in the Caucasian population, extending for the whole region.
Conclusion: Complexity and variability are essential genomic features of the α-defensin cluster at
the 8p23.1 region. The identification of population differences in subjects lacking the DEFA3 gene
may be suggestive of population-specific selective pressures with potential impact on human health.

Background
Defensin genes encode a family of small cationic peptides
that act as antimicrobial mediators of the innate immune
system [1]. Defensins are arginine-rich peptides and invariably contain disulfide-linked cysteine residues, whose
positions are conserved [2]. The two main defensin subfamilies, α- and β-defensins, differ in the length of the
peptide segments between cysteine residues and in the

arrangement of disulphide bonds that link them. βdefensins have been found in most vertebrate species,
whereas α-defensins are specific to mammals [3]. Based
on their adjacent chromosomal location, similar precursor peptides and gene structures, it has been postulated
that all vertebrate defensins arose from a common gene
precursor [4]. While the efficacy of individual defensins
against specific infectious agents varies, they have shown

antimicrobial activity against gram-negative and grampositive bacteria, fungi and enveloped viruses [1,5]. At
high concentrations, some defensins are also cytotoxic to
mammalian cells, as cells exposed to high amounts of
defensins in inflamed tissues generate pro-inflammatory
signals that can contribute to tissue injury [1]. In humans,
most of the genes encoding α- and β-defensins are located
in clusters on chromosome 8p23.1 [6,7]. Within the
region, two different defensin clusters can be distinguished: a telomeric cluster mostly containing α-defensin
genes (DEFB1, DEFA6, DEFA4, DEFA1, DEFT1, DEFA3
and DEFA5) and at least two centromeric clusters of βdefensin genes (DEFB109p, DEFB108, DEFB4, DEFB103,
DEFB104, DEFB106, DEFB105 and DEFB107) [7].
Chromosome band 8p23.1 is known to be a frequent site
of chromosomal rearrangements mediated by low copy
repeats (LCRs) or segmental duplications (SDs). It has
been described that as many as one in four individuals
from the general population carry a 4.7 Megabase (Mb)
inversion of the region [8-10]. In addition, copy number
variability involving both α-defensin (DEFA1 and
DEFA3) and β-defensin (DEFB4, DEFB103 and DEFB104)
genes in chromosome 8p23.1 has been well detected and
characterized [11-14]. The number of DEFA1 and DEFA3
gene copies has been reported to range from 4 to 11 in a
sample of 111 subjects, the DEFA3 allele being completely
absent in 10% of them [12]. Gene nomenclature for
DEFA1, DEFT1 and DEFA3 has been replaced by
DEFA1A3, following recommendations of Aldred et al,
since these genes have been considered as being part of a
copy number variant (CNV) region [14]. In another study,
Linzmeier and colleagues determined copy numbers of
the DEFA1 and DEFA3 alleles in 27 subjects and found
between 5 and 14 copies per diploid genome, with DEFA3
being absent in 26% of them [14].
Despite DEFA1 and DEFA3 being considered as members
of the same CNV (DEFA1A3), they encode different peptides, HNP-1 and HNP-3, respectively. The mature HNP-1
and HNP-3 peptides differ only in their N-terminal amino
acid, due to a single nucleotide difference, C3400A,
between the DEFA1 and the DEFA3 genes [15]. This
C3400A is a paralogous sequence variant (PSV) that
allows discrimination between the two gene copies. The
HNP-2 peptide is identical to the last 29 amino acids of
both the HNP-1 and the HNP-3 peptides. HNP-2 is presumably produced from proHNP-1 and/or proHNP-3 by
post-translational proteolytic cleavage [1]. It is likely that
one or both genes, or another member of the DEFA1A3
CNV cluster encode the HNP-2 peptide. The three peptides are constitutively produced by neutrophil cell precursors and packaged in granules before mature
neutrophils are released into the blood. During phagocy-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/14

tosis, the defensin-containing granules fuse to phagocytic
vacuoles where defensins act as antimicrobial agents [15].
Recent work has shown that CNVs are a major source of
genetic variation [16]. Individual variability in resistance
to infectious diseases has been extensively reported [17].
However, the causes of this diversity in immune function
are poorly understood. CNVs involving immune genes
could contribute to the differences in innate immunity
between individuals and influence predisposition and
susceptibility to diseases, as it has been shown for human
immunodeficiency virus and AIDS [18]. Thus, it is important to analyze the impact of defensin gene CNVs on
human health, both in healthy volunteers and in patients
with disease [1,19]. In this report we have studied the
presence of DEFA3 in samples from different human populations. For this purpose, we used the International Haplotype Map (HapMap) Project collection and a cohort of
Spanish healthy individuals.

Results
Differences in the proportion of DEFA3 absence between
populations
We have analyzed 786 samples from four populations
with ancestry in Europe, Africa or Asia (the HapMap collection), including Spanish healthy individuals. The
source used for this study was the HapMap collection of
269 samples utilized by the International HapMap Consortium for the study of human genomic variation, initially through the investigation of SNPs and their
associated haplotypes [20], and 180 additional HapMap
samples. This collection comprises four populations: 30
parent-offspring trios (90 individuals) of the Yoruba from
Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI), 30 parent-offspring trios (90 individuals) of European descent from Utah, USA (CEU), 45
unrelated Japanese from Tokyo, Japan (JPT) and 44 unrelated Han Chinese from Beijing, China (CHB). In addition, 30 Yoruban trios, 45 unrelated Japanese and 45
unrelated Chinese from the HapMap collection, but not
genotyped in the HapMap project, were analyzed. The
Spanish samples were 336 unrelated blood donor controls, all of Caucasian origin. Genomic DNA from EBVtransformed lymphoblastoid cell-lines was used. As Chinese and Japanese allele frequencies are found to be very
similar [20], the analysis was performed combining both
datasets, resulting in four different groups of samples
tested: two Caucasian groups (CEU and Spanish general
population subjects), Yoruba and Chinese/Japanese.

The coding sequence of DEFA1 and DEFA3 differs only by
a single nucleotide (C3400A), which allows distinguishing between DEFA1 and DEFA3 by HaeIII digestion, since
a restriction site for this enzyme is absent in the DEFA3
sequence. All samples had at least one DEFA1 copy, but
DEFA3 was absent in several subjects of all populations.

DEFA3 was absent in different proportions depending on
the population tested, ranging from 10% in the Chinese/
Japanese dataset to 37% in the Yoruba samples (Table 1).
There were statistically significant differences for the
absence of DEFA3 when comparing Yoruba samples with
each of the other population groups (Table 1) or with the
total of non-Yoruban unrelated subjects (p < 0.001). As
both Caucasian and Yoruba samples are trios, inheritance
of the DEFA3 allele could also be assessed, showing no
abnormal segregation in any of the trios analyzed (data
not shown).
Segmental duplications and genomic organization of αdefensin cluster
The genomic organization of the α-defensin cluster was
precisely defined by PipMaker analysis [21]. For this analysis, a region of 150 kb containing the whole α-defensin
cluster on 8p23.1 was used (based on May 2004 human
genome assembly). The alignment of the region against
itself identified different sequences with high homology,
which correspond to six α-defensin genes (DEFA6,
DEFA4, DEFA1, DEFA3 and DEFA5), six α-defensin pseudogenes (DEFA8P, DEFA9P, DEFA10P, DEFA11P and
DEFA7P) and one θ-defensin pseudogene (DEFT1P) (Figure 1a). Such clustered organization of α-defensin genes is
common in other species, suggesting that α-defensin have
arisen from a common ancestor by gene duplication followed by diversification [3]. Phylogenetic analysis of all
human α-defensin genes and pseudogenes showed that
DEFA5 and DEFA6 seem to be the ancestral genes. All
pseudogenes are clustered together with these two genes,
with the exception of DEFA10P and DEFT1P, which are
closely related with DEFA1 and DEFA3 (Figure 1b).

Three copies of a 19-kb repeat unit were identified within
the α-defensin cluster, which correspond to the DEFA1A3
CNV, previously reported to be variable in copy number
between individuals (Figure 2) [12,14]. Each of the 19-kb
repeats contained a copy of the DEFA1 or DEFA3 genes,
together with a pseudogene, either DEFA10P or DEFT1.
DEFA10P and DEFT1P have a high sequence identity and
are closely related in the phylogenetic analysis, which is in
accordance with the theory that primate specific θdefensins evolved from α-defensins after divergence of the
primates from other mammalian species [3] (Figure 1b).
Variation in both number and position of DEFA1 and
DEFA3 alleles has been reported, indicating that these
genes are located in interchangeable variant cassettes
within tandem gene arrays [12,14]. Thus, the existing
diversity in DEFA1/DEFA3 copy number and localization
is probably the result of unequal crossing-over events
between tandem arrays [12]. Interestingly, multiple copies of DEFA1, but not the DEFA3 gene, can be in silico
identified in chimpanzee by BLAST sequence similarity
searches. On the other hand, in the case of Rhesus

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/14

macaque the DEFA5 gene is present in multiple copies,
suggesting a different evolutionary pattern driven by the
responses to specific microbial challenges [3].
HapMap samples have been tested for the presence of
CNVs by two different techniques Affymetrix SNP array
and BAC array [22]. DEFA1A3 region was identified as a
CNV in 23 subjects (3 Caucasian, 7 Yoruban, and 13 Chinese/Japanese), but only in four cases where a gain or loss
was detected, DEFA3 is absent. Copy number variation in
the DEFA1A3 region is reported to be much more common than the variation identified by Redon et al [22].
However, the small size of the DEFA1A3 CNV makes it
undetectable with BAC arrays. Moreover, the presence of
segmental duplications in the region entails a bad SNP
coverage of the region by the Affymetrix SNP array, which
does not allow an accurate detection of the CNV. Thus, the
study of this CNV for association purposes has to be performed by quantitative methods or by the analysis of paralogous sequence variants.
Patterns of linkage disequilibrium for DEFA1A3 in
HapMap samples
A region of 100 kb, spanning from 6,810,001 bp to
6,910,000 bp, which contains the DEFA1A3 cluster and
the single copy gene DEFA5 was chosen for the linkage
disequilibrium analysis (based on human genome assembly hg17) (Figure 2). The HapMap data for the DEFA1A3
region included around 150 SNPs for each population
(151 Caucasian, 169 Yoruba, 158 Japanese and 154 Chinese). However, only 136 of the SNPs had genotype data
in all four populations. Interestingly, almost all genotyped SNPs are located outside the DEFA1A3 cluster (Figure 2). The absence of genotyped SNPs in the DEFA1A3
cluster is in agreement with the presence of segmental
duplications that include the DEFA1A3 genes. Thus, the
non-homogeneous distribution of SNPs within the region
could be at least partially explained by the presence of
high homologous repeated sequences. Genotyping errors
enhanced by the presence of DEFA1/DEFA3 tandem gene
arrays could have lead investigators to discard SNPs
located within this region.

Of the 136 SNPs analyzed in all four populations, 55 were
monomorphic in at least one of them (28 out of the 55
SNPs were monomorphic in all populations). Monomorphic SNPs can be used to measure genetic variability, by
analyzing their distribution in the different populations.
The Chinese and Japanese groups had the highest proportion of monomorphic SNPs (34%) which was very similar
to that observed for Caucasian samples (31%), whereas
the Yoruba samples had the smallest number of monomorphic SNPs (24%). This indicates that genetic variability is higher within Yoruba samples, while Chinese/
Japanese and Caucasian populations show similar pro-

portions of genetic variability. This higher variability for
Yoruba samples is similar to that detected in the HapMap
analysis for the whole genome [20]. Interestingly, the proportion of monomorphic SNPs in this region is about
10% higher for each population group than the average
reported for the HapMap data [20].
The patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in each population are summarized in Figure 3. The Yoruba samples
show the lowest LD, the greatest variability and smaller
haploblocks compared to Caucasian or Chinese/Japanese
samples, which have similar patterns of LD. The differences observed in LD patterns between populations are in
accordance with DEFA3 locus absence results; the Yoruba
samples showing highest LD variability and also having
the highest proportion of DEFA3 absence.
DEFA1A3 region haplotype association with DEFA3
absence in HapMap samples
To assess whether DEFA3 is inherited together with neighbor SNPs, an association study was performed using the
HapMap data for the 100-kb region including the
DEFA1A3 cluster. All the SNPs of the region genotyped in
the HapMap project were tested for association with the
C3400A PSV, which defines the presence or absence of

DEFA3 gene, respectively. No association for any of the
genotyped SNPs was found in the Yoruba or Japanese/
Chinese populations. However, a significant association
was found between absence of DEFA3 and 18 SNPs in the
Caucasian samples, under a recessive mode of inheritance
(Figure 4a, Additional file 1). Association between estimated haplotypes within defined LD blocks and the
C3400A PSV has also been tested. Again, the Caucasian
group was the only one in which significant association
was obtained (Figure 4b). Moreover, the associated haplotype spans nearly the whole 100-kb region, indicating a
lack of recombination between the LD blocks when
DEFA3 gene is absent. The frequency of DEFA3 lacking
haplotype's would be similar to that estimated by the
Haploview program, which varies from 16%–33%
depending on the haplotype block (Figure 4b). This estimation correlates well with the observed frequency of
DEFA3 absence in Caucasians (15%).

Discussion
Several studies have recently reported a previously
unknown high prevalence of copy number variation in
humans [16]. A recent study of CNVs in the HapMap samples has defined over 1400 CNV regions [22]. On average,
each individual varies at over 100 CNVs, representing

about 20 Mb of genomic DNA difference. It has been suggested that CNVs account for a significant proportion of
human normal phenotypic variation. It is thought that
CNVs may also have an important role in the pathological
variation in the human population [16,23]. Analyses of
the functional attributes of currently known CNVs reveal
a remarkable enrichment for genes that are relevant to
molecular-environmental interactions and genes that
influence response to specific environmental stimuli, such
as genes involved in immune response and inflammation
[16].
CNVs involving α- and β-defensin genes (DEFA1A3 and
DEFB4/DEFB103A) in the 8p23.1 region have been extensively characterized [12-14]. From a pathologic point of
view, it is likely that α- and/or β-defensin CNVs affect the
function and effectiveness of innate immunity. Such
effects could be influenced by the frequent absence of the
DEFA3 allele. In the present work, we have tested the
absence of the DEFA3 allele in different human populations, finding significant differences between them, which

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/14

could be indicative of differences in innate immune function between populations. This is not surprising since the
different human population groups have been exposed to
different environments regarding infectious agents and
other factors. One obvious way by which CNVs result in
human phenotypic diversity is by altering the transcriptional levels of the genes which vary in copy number [16].
In addition, it has been postulated that retention of duplicate genes, rather than mutation to pseudogenes or neofunctionalization, is due to the generation of increased
amounts of a beneficial product [24]. This could be the
case of DEFA1A3 in which variation in DEFA1 and DEFA3
copy number, and DEFA3 absence could underlie variable
resistance to infection among individuals. Different selective pressures acting in each geographic region could
likely explain population differences in DEFA3 absence.
Taudien and colleagues by manual clone-by-clone alignment significantly improved the assembly of defensin
8p23.1 locus, providing in silico evidences of the experimentally verified variability in defensin copy number and
better representing the locus diversity [7]. The exceptional
genomic complexity and heterogeneity of the human
8p23.1 locus and the prominent role of defensins in the
innate immunity framework raise the question of whether
individual patterns of haplotypes, together with the variability in defensin genes copy number, affect the functionality of the defensin system. To address this issue, Taudien
et al provided a molecular approach for the determination
of individual defensin gene repertoires limited to 8p23.1
β-defensin clusters and using data from a 500 bp fragment
in 4 individuals [7]. In our case, we have characterized in
detail the haplotype diversity and LD structure of a 100-kb
region around α-defensin locus in 269 HapMap samples.
The SNP distribution of the region is characteristic of the
presence of segmental duplications, which result in a lowdensity of SNPs selected for genotyping. As previously
reported for other genomic regions [25], the Yoruba samples present a higher variability than both the Chinese/
Japanese and Caucasian samples. Additionally, in the
Yoruban, the haploblock structures were smaller and the
extent of LD between SNPs was lower, in accordance with
the out-of-Africa theory for the origins of humans. The
observation that the proportion of subjects lacking the
DEFA3 gene is greater in Yoruba samples together with the
fact that DEFA3 is thought to be human specific [12] may
be an indication of the higher amount of original genetic
variation among the first humans living in Africa, which
afterwards migrated to other continents. The initial migration occurred as multiple, branching events and involved
many founder effects in which certain haplotypes, SNPs
and alleles appear to have increased in frequency in emigrant populations owing to genetic drift and different
selection pressures [25]. In this sense, we observed a

diminished frequency of subjects without DEFA3 in Caucasian and Asian samples.
When association with DEFA3 absence was tested, SNPs
and haplotypes in the Caucasian population were the
only ones to be significant. The association observed in
the Caucasian samples could be the result of strong
founder effect. Founder effects and, particularly, the
decrease in genetic diversity resulting from continental
migrations, are associated with an increased haplotype
length [25]. This is observed when comparing the haplo-

type block patterns of the different populations analyzed,
in which the Caucasian samples set has the longest haplotype blocks. Alternatively, Aldred and colleagues demonstrated that DEFA3 has arisen at the 5' end repeat position
and has transferred to other positions within the array
through unequal recombination between alleles [12],
suggesting that recombination has been active in shaping
diversity in the DEFA1A3 locus. However, our results indicate that, at least in the Caucasian samples, there has been
little recombination between chromosomes with and
without DEFA3, as we are able to find a haplotype associ-

ated with DEFA3 absence extending for nearly 100-kb.
Moreover, as for DEFA3 absence, other haplotypes are
likely to be associated with other patterns of CNV polymorphisms. However, other situations cannot be rule out
without analyzing large pedigrees to determine unambiguously each chromosome structure at DEFA1A3 CNV.
The impact on human health of this qualitative variation
in the presence of the DEFA3 gene product deserves to be
explored in epidemiologic studies. Different studies have
described differences in the function and specificity of
DEFA1 and DEFA3 gene products, HNP1 and HNP3
[1,19]. In general, HNP3 is thought to be less active than
HNP1 against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria [26], but it is expressed at about twice the level of
HNP1 [12]. On the other hand, DEFA3 but not DEFA1,
has been found upregulated in patients with systemic
lupus erythematosus, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura or rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting that DEFA3
upregulation might be a general feature of autoimmune
diseases [27,28]. Therefore, the observed differences in
DEFA3 absence may partially explain the different population incidences of infectious and/or autoimmune diseases in which DEFA3 plays an important role. Future
studies are needed to establish whether patterns of DEFA3
absence correlate with certain population microbial exposures or different prevalence of autoimmune disorders.
This could also be important in determining the exact
nature of DEFA3 function and its specificity of action, if
any, against certain antigens. Last, but not least, further
studies focused on the determination of the total copy
number of DEFA1A3 units will be crucial to build the
complete picture of DEFA1A3 CNVs' impact on human
health.

Conclusion
Complexity and variability are essential genomic features
of the α-defensin cluster at 8p23.1 region. The present
work gains insight into the existent variability in human
populations in this specific region. The identification of
population differences in the proportion of subjects lacking the DEFA3 gene may be suggestive of population-specific selective pressures, which should be studied in
further inter-population epidemiological studies.

Methods
Patients and samples
The analysis was performed on 450 HapMap samples and
336 Spanish controls. Unless otherwise noted, all samples
were obtained from the Coriell Institute for Medical
Research. A detailed description of HapMap populations
samples can be found elsewhere [20]. Written informed
consent for the Spanish controls was obtained with the
approval of the Institute Review Board and Ethics Committee.

DEFA3 determination
A PCR amplification assay followed by restriction enzyme
digestion (PCR-RFLP) has been used to discriminate
DEFA1 (GenBank accession number L12690) and DEFA3
(GenBank accession number L12691) genes differing by a
single nucleotide. A fragment of 304 bp around C3400A
SNP was PCR amplified with fluorescently labelled primers
(Forward
5'-TGAGAGCAAAGGAGAATGAG-3',
Reverse 5'-GCAGAATGCCCAGAGTCTTC-3') and digested
with HaeIII enzyme. In order to accomplish complete
digestion, we used saturating conditions (2.5 U/25 μl
reaction) of the enzyme to digest a short DNA fragment
containing only one cutting site. In addition, in all the
runs, a DEFA3 negative sample was included, as a positive
control of the assay. About 2 μl of digestion product was
added to 10 μl HiDi formamide containing ROX500
marker (Applied Biosystems) and run on an ABI 3100
capillary system (Applied Biosystems). Peaks were analysed using Genemapper software (Applied Biosystems).
Characterization of the segmental duplications
The UCSC Genome Browser [29] served as the main
source of genomic sequence, using the human genome
assembly hg17. The region analysed was a 150 kb contig
from 6,760,001 bp to 6,910,000 bp of chromosome
8p23.1 (based on human genome assembly hg17).
Sequences were repeat-masked and aligned against itself
using PipMaker [21]. The size, orientation and structure of
segmental duplications can be interpreted by using the
PIP and Dot-Plot output generated by PipMaker. Multiple
sequence alignments and phylogenetic tree construction
were carried out by using the ClustalW program [30].
Statistical analysis
Between groups chi-square test was performed to compare
the proportion of DEFA3 absence in different human populations. Genotyping data from HapMap public database
[31] was used to test the hypothesis of association
between geneticpolymorphisms and DEFA3 absence
using logistic regression models. Odds ratios (OR)and
95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for
eachgenotype compared with the homozygous for the
major allele (theallele with greater frequency among individuals lacking the DEFA3 allele). Analyses were initially
done under a codominant inheritance model (three genotypes separated). Then, simplified models were fitted: a
dominant model (heterozygous grouped with the
homozygous for the minor allele), a recessive model (heterozygous grouped with the homozygous for the major
allele), an overdominant model (homozygous grouped)
and a log-additive model (a score was assigned counting
the number of minor alleles: the homozygote for the
major allele was given score 0, the heterozygote score 1,
and the homozygote for the minor allele score 2). The
model with lowest Akaike information criteria was the

recessive one (minus twice the log likelihood of the model
plus the number of variables in the model) and it was
selected for an easy summary of the results. P values were
derived from likelihood ratio tests, and a significance level
of 5% (two sided) was used for the analyses. All these
analyses were performed using the SNPassoc R package
[32].
Haploblocks were constructed using Haploview program
[33]. Haplotypes were reconstructed using the expectation
maximization (EM) algorithm implemented in the
haplo.stats R package [34]. The OR and 95% CI were estimated using a generalized linear-regression framework
that incorporates haplotype phase uncertainty by inferring a probability matrix of haplotype likelihoods also
implemented in haplo.stats library.
