Resolving the infection process reveals striking
differences in the contribution of environment,
genetics and phylogeny to host-parasite interactions

Abstract
Background: Infection processes consist of a sequence of steps, each critical for the interaction between host and
parasite. Studies of host-parasite interactions rarely take into account the fact that different steps might be
influenced by different factors and might, therefore, make different contributions to shaping coevolution. We
designed a new method using the Daphnia magna - Pasteuria ramosa system, one of the rare examples where
coevolution has been documented, in order to resolve the steps of the infection and analyse the factors that
influence each of them.
Results: Using the transparent Daphnia hosts and fluorescently-labelled spores of the bacterium P. ramosa, we
identified a sequence of infection steps: encounter between parasite and host; activation of parasite dormant
spores; attachment of spores to the host; and parasite proliferation inside the host. The chances of encounter had
been shown to depend on host genotype and environment. We tested the role of genetic and environmental
factors in the newly described activation and attachment steps. Hosts of different genotypes, gender and species
were all able to activate endospores of all parasite clones tested in different environments; suggesting that the
activation cue is phylogenetically conserved. We next established that parasite attachment occurs onto the host
oesophagus independently of host species, gender and environmental conditions. In contrast to spore activation,
attachment depended strongly on the combination of host and parasite genotypes.
Conclusions: Our results show that different steps are influenced by different factors. Host-type-independent spore
activation suggests that this step can be ruled out as a major factor in Daphnia-Pasteuria coevolution. On the other
hand, we show that the attachment step is crucial for the pronounced genetic specificities of this system. We
suggest that this one step can explain host population structure and could be a key force behind coevolutionary
cycles. We discuss how different steps can explain different aspects of the coevolutionary dynamics of the system:
the properties of the attachment step, explaining the rapid evolution of infectivity and the properties of later
parasite proliferation explaining the evolution of virulence. Our study underlines the importance of resolving the
infection process in order to better understand host-parasite interactions.

Background
Host-parasite coevolution is the result of multiple adaptations and counter-adaptations evolving in concert
within the constraints of a particular system. Hosts use
diverse defence mechanisms that coevolve with the
offensive mechanisms of the parasite. From phages to
ectoparasites, the success of infection depends on a series of steps and for each of them, the hosts may have

specific defence mechanisms [1,2]. The following steps
may be distinguished, with greater or fewer steps potentially existing depending on the system and the level of
resolution: The host encounter with the parasite is the
first step. During this step, the host may exhibit particular behaviours in order to avoid the parasite [3] and
there may be polymorphism for such behaviours within
species [4]. Once the encounter has taken place, parasites with a dormant stage may need to be activated in
order to terminate diapause and initiate the infection
process - for example, by endospore germination [see,

for example, [5]]. After the activation step, endoparasites
need to enter the host tissues. For many parasites,
including the one studied here, this occurs through the
attachment of the parasites to the host tissues but hosts
may evolve to prevent this attachment. For example,
plants often have very specific mechanisms to prevent
fungal pathogens from entering leaf tissue [6] and some
species produce layers upon their epithelium - the first
barrier against infection - to obstruct parasite penetration (for example, mucus in coral protection [7] or salivary mucins to preserve the oral cavity health [8]). After
attachment and entering its host, the next step of infection is proliferation. To counteract parasite growth, the
host adapts physiologically (for example, iron-withholding [9]) or actively defends itself with an immune
response. In the final step of infection, the parasite
releases transmission stages to infect other hosts.
It has been argued that the fact that infection trials
often intermingle the effects of different infection steps
strongly influences our interpretation of host-parasite
interactions [1,10,11]. For example, if only one of the
steps is specific, the entire infection process will be specific. The same is true for environmental effects and
host genotype-parasite genotype interactions. Furthermore, even if each of the steps is under simple genetic
control (one or few loci) the combination of all of them
might behave as a quantitative genetic trait and become
more difficult to investigate. Resolving the infection process into its component steps simplifies the complexity
of the infection process and helps us to better understand host-parasite interactions. Evolutionary models of
host-parasite interactions are usually based on relatively
simple assumptions about the underlying genetics and
the impact of the environment. They commonly consider binary (Yes/No) infection outcomes (for example,
matching-allele matrix [12-14]), even though available
experimental data suggests more quantitative outcomes
when looking at host and parasite interactions [15-17].
Explicit analysis of individual steps of infection can help
bring in line theoretical models and data concerning the
entire infection.
As little is known about the degree of specificity of
the individual steps, the specificity attributed to hostparasite interactions is usually the combined effect of all
steps. Although it is reasonable to assume that different
steps are under the control of different genes, and are
influenced by the environment to different degrees, it is
possible that a single component of the infection pathway may explain most of the observed variation in hostparasite interactions. This is particularly important
because understanding variation in host susceptibility is
central for controlling disease and understanding evolution. Here, we use the Daphnia-Pasteuria host-parasite
system to investigate which step(s) best explain(s) the

high degree of host genotype by parasite genotype interactions reported for this system [18-20]. We analyse the
contribution of host and parasite genetics, host gender,
host phylogeny and of the environment for the
dynamics of host-parasite co-evolution.
Reproduction in planctonic crustacean Daphnia is primarily clonal, which is most suitable for dissociations of
genetic and environmental effects of its interactions with
parasites. Daphnia are frequently found to suffer from
bacterial, fungal and microsporidial infections [21,22];
among them the Gram-positive bacterium Pasteuria
ramosa [21-23]. P. ramosa produces endospores for
transmission (Figure 1a and 1b[21]) that can remain dormant for decades [24]. Transmission is waterborne and
endospores do not have flagella. The infection process is
unknown but penetration of the host cuticula has been
observed for the congeneric species P. penetrans, a parasite of root-knot nematodes [25]. Inside the host,
P. ramosa proliferates in the haemocoel and musculature,
castrates females and is transmitted horizontally after the
release of endospores from the dead host [26,27]. The
interaction of D. magna clones and P. ramosa clones has
been shown to be specific [20]. Pasteuria was shown to
impose strong selection on its host [28] and there is evidence for coevolution [29]. Furthermore, strong effects of
the environment and genotype-environment interactions
were reported for the overall infection process [30,31].
The goal of this study is to disentangle the different steps
of the infection process and to analyse how they are
shaped by host and parasite genetics, and the environment. We aim at finding the step that explains the greatest variance for the strong host-parasite interactions
reported for the overall infection process.
We consider the following steps of the infection process and will investigate in details the second and the
third, previously undescribed: (i) encounter; (ii) activation (once in contact with Daphnia, parasite endospores
need a signal to germinate); (iii) attachment (the parasite
must attach to the host and cross the host epithelium);
(iv) proliferation (parasite proliferation and spore production); and (v) termination (killing the host to release
spores). Environmental and host clone effects have been
shown for the encounter and the proliferation steps
[4,30,32-35]. However, neither of them can explain the
strong host genotype by parasite genotype interactions
described for the overall infection process in this system.
Here, we localize where the activation and attachment
steps take place and test for the genetic and environmental factors that influence those steps.

magna hosts in order to investigate the activation of
parasite spores and the attachment of the parasite to the
host. Within minutes of exposing the Daphnia host to
the P. ramosa spores, we observed a characteristic
change in spore morphology. Spores acquire a sombrero-like structure (Figure 1c and 1d) which corresponds to the shedding of the exosporium and the
extension of the peripheral fibres. This morphology was
never observed in spores not exposed to hosts. We call
this morphological change in spore shape âactivationâ.
Activation was found to happen regardless of the host
clone or Pasteuria clone used and was observed in both
resistant and susceptible D. magna clones (Table 1).

forming a dense layer in the oesophagus, while there
were no spores attached in resistant combinations. We
never observed ambiguous cases (for example, only few
spores attached). While spores in the mid and end gut
moved with the flow of the food, those attached to the
oesophagus were not disturbed by passing boluses of
food, indicating that they strongly adhere. In resistant
combinations spores were never seen attached to the
oesophagus and all spores passed with the flow of the
food through the gut (Figure 2b). Thus, spore attachment in the oesophagus was very specific to the
D. magna and P. ramosa genotype and consistent with
resistant/susceptibility status for each combination.

Spore attachment

Influence of gender and culture conditions

We used different combinations of hosts and parasite
clones previously characterized to be resistant or susceptible to given Pasteuria clones [20]. We observed the
fate of fluorescent spores of three parasite clones
exposed to 14 D. magna host clones with the aim of
identifying differences which correlate with the compatibility of a given host-parasite combination (Table 1).
The parasites attach to the host oesophagus for all susceptible (compatible) host-parasite combinations,
but they never do so for the resistant combinations
(Table 1, Figures 1f and 2a). Thus, the result of this
attachment-test was 100% consistent with the results of
infection trials (Table 1). For susceptible combinations
the host oesophagus was densely covered with spores

Activation of spores was observed in all treatments and
in all host clone-Pasteuria clone combinations (Table 2).
In contrast, the specificity revealed by the attachmenttest was found to be independent of host gender, temperature and culture conditions (single versus crowded;
high versus low food, Table 2).
Spore activation and resistance of other Daphnia species

Spores were found to be activated after exposure to all
Daphnia species tested (Table 3). We found that spores
of the P. ramosa clone C19 were able to attach to the
oesophagus and infect D. dolichocephala (Table 3) but
did not attach to the oesophagus or infect D. arenata,
D. galeata, D. barbata, D. similis or D. lumholtzi. We

We tested all combinations of three Pasteuria ramosa clones (C19, C14, C1) with 14 Daphnia magna clones. Infection trials results are defined by exposing
Daphnia to the parasites and determining the infection status after 20 days. Resistant means that none of the replicates were infected. Activation was
determined by observing spores in the gut of the host with a sombrero-like shape. R means that the host clone is totally resistant to the concerned parasite
clone. S means that the host clone is susceptible to the concerned parasite clone. Yes means that the spores were activated.

also tested other species for spore activation of P.
ramosa. Upon exposure to Simocephalus vetulus (Daphniidae) spores were readily activated but did not attach
to the oesophagus or infect any of the individuals tested.
Upon exposure to mosquito larvae (Culex spp.), which
are also filter-feeding but are not crustaceans, P. ramosa
spores were neither activated nor attached to the host.

Discussion
The aim of the current study was to analyse two steps in
the life cycle of a bacterial parasite, characterize the specificity of the interaction, with regard to genetic and environmental factors, and relate these findings to what is
known about host-parasite coevolution in this system. We
focused on the activation of the parasiteâs resting stages
and on the attachment of the activated spores to the host
tissue where it enters the host. Our study revealed that
P. ramosa spores captured by the filter feeding Daphnia
are indiscriminately activated by every Daphnia clone and
Daphnia species tested (Tables 1 and 3). Furthermore,
activation was not only found to be independent of the
host genotype or species and host gender but also of the
environmental conditions (namely, density, temperature
and food conditions). The following step of the infection
process, however, the attachment of the activated spore to
the oesophagus wall of the host, depended strongly on the
combination of the D. magna and parasite genotype, but
not on the hostâs gender, nor the environmental conditions in which they were kept (Tables 1, 2, 3).
Previous studies with the Daphnia-Pasteuria system
were not able to disentangle the activation, attachment
and proliferation steps. Thus, variation in infection success as reported in earlier studies [19,32,35-40] may be
explained by the combined effects of these steps. However, the binary polymorphism found in infection trials
with high doses of single parasite clone [20] correlates
perfectly with the results of our attachment-test (Table
1). This suggests that only Pasteuria clones able to
attach to the oesophagus are able to infect the host.
Ben-Ami et al. [38] proposed that D. magna might be
either completely resistant or susceptible to P. ramosa
depending on the genotype-genotype interaction. They

called this the âbinary infection hypothesisâ. Our data are
consistent with this hypothesis and further pinpoint
which specific step of the infection process is responsible for the high degree of specificity. For a given combination of host and parasite genotypes, the activated
spores are either able to attach and then infect or they
do not attach and do not infect. We did not see any evidence for a graded (quantitative) form of interaction.
Spore attachment is a key step in Daphnia-Pasteuria
coevolution

The Daphnia-Pasteuria system has become one of the
prime examples of antagonistic coevolution. Host and
parasites show strong genetic effects for resistance, virulence and infectivity; genotype Ã genotype interactions
have been reported within and across populations and
selection acts rapidly in natural populations [18,19,40,41].
Our study suggests that the parasite-dependent [28] host
population structure and the coevolution [29] described
for this system are mainly driven by the properties of a
unique step, the attachment step. First, this step revealed
very strong host genotype by parasite genotype interactions (Table 1). Second, the attachment step is independent of the environmental conditions. Third, a recent
study of D. magna - P. ramosa coevolution using resurrected host and parasite isolates from lake sediments
showed a signal of fluctuating selection only for infectivity but not for parasite virulence [29]. Virulence (the
parasiteâs effect on infected hosts) was also observed to
evolve but at a slower rate [29]. The authors proposed
that the difference between the evolution of virulence
and infectivity resulted from different genes contributing
to these traits. Here we give a mechanistic explanation
for this finding. Infectivity depends on the attachment
and, most likely, on the ligands present on the host and
on the parasite. On the other hand, expression of virulence may depend on the hostâs immune response during
the within-host proliferation step. It is likely that these
processes are determined by different sets of genes.
The identification of the attachment step as the key
step in the coevolutionary dynamics in this system will
allow us to improve our understanding of the patterns

Duneau et al. BMC Biology 2011, 9:11
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/11

of antagonistic coevolution. For example, evolutionary
models studying the coevolution of the infectivity and
the virulence steps [42] can fit our system in relation to
the coevolution of the attachment and the proliferation
steps. Those models typically characterize infection outcomes as binary (Yes/No), while empirical data suggest
they are more quantitative [15-17]. We show that we
can observe a binary outcome when individual steps of
the infection process are considered. Furthermore, our
method provides a fast and reliable way to test individuals and populations for their susceptibility to Pasteuria. Ongoing research in our group showed that up
to 400 Daphnia individuals can be tested in a day (P
Luijckx, in preparation). The assay we developed makes
it possible to test for susceptibility without the potentially confounding effect of the within-host proliferation
step in the infection trials.
From the environment to the host body cavity

The resting endospores of P. ramosa can remain dormant for decades under harsh environmental conditions
[24,29]. Before attachment to the host, the spores need
to be activated (Figure 1d). The filter-feeding Daphnia
capture particles, including parasites, from the water
and transport them on a mucus-layered pathway from
the phyllopods to the mouth. During this process, the
parasiteâs exosporium opens by an unknown trigger,
releasing the activated spore form within less than 10
min (Figure 1). Despite the fact that spore activation is
a necessary step for the infection, this step is entirely
unspecific with regard to Daphnia species and clone,
host gender and the environmental conditions (Tables
1, 2, 3). The signal that triggers spore activation may be
related to chemical substances in the mucus of the filtering apparatus, but other factors (for example,
mechanical) cannot be excluded.
Once the activated spore enters the oesophagus, it will
attach to the oesophagus wall if the host and the parasite genotype are compatible. There it presumably penetrates the gut wall and enters the hostâs body cavity.
A similar attachment process on the cuticula is also
known from P. penetrans but, in this case, the parasite
seems to be able to attach to any area of the nematodeâs
body surface [25]. It has been proposed that the lower
part of P. nishizawae attaches to the host because this
part is densely covered by microfibres [43]. In contrast,
in P. ramosa it is the upper part of the peripheral fibres
(Figure 1e) that are most densely covered with a layer of
microfibres. These fibres may be involved in the attachment (Figure 1f).
An endospore adhesin epitope, situated on the exosporium of P. ramosa, has been identified and it has
been suggested that it may be a ligand responsible for
the recognition and the binding onto the host [44].

Page 7 of 11

However, according to our results, it is unlikely that
this epitope is involved in the attachment because the
exosporium of P. ramosa is removed during the activation step. A later study, analysing surface proteins of
P. ramosa spores by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, proposed that a collagen-like protein may be
responsible for the binding onto the host but might
suffer the same problem of the previous study [45].
We propose that later studies on candidate proteins
responsible for the specific attachment to the host in
this system should investigate the spores once
activated.
The development of Pasteuria, from the moment they
attach to the oesophagus until the vegetative stage can
be detected in the hemolymph (about 8 days at 20Â°C
[46]), is unknown. Also, the penetration mechanism is
poorly described. Sayre and Wergin [25] show a transmission electron micrograph of P. penetrans with a
structure they call a âgerm tubeâ crossing the host
epithelium. Our hypothesis is that the endospore makes
a hole across the host epithelium and injects its cortex
into the host. As one response of Daphnia to wounding
is an increase of Phenoloxidase (PO) activity [47], one
might expect the penetration process to trigger an
immune response but this remains an open question.
However, resolving the infection process will allow the
study of the immune response during the proliferation
step without the confounding effect of genetic variation
in the attachment step.
Environment effects and the proliferation step

We found that environmental effects do not influence
the activation and attachment step (Table 2). Excluding
these steps, we suggest that the proliferation step is the
one responsible for the reported sensitivity of the overall
infection process for environment effects [32,34]. The
activation and the attachment steps seem independent
of the hostâs immune system (defined as a system that is
potentially able to kill parasites), while the proliferation
step is likely to be governed by the hostâs immune system. The immune system may lead to variation between
and within those Daphnia clones that allow Pasteuria
attachment (and, thus, enable the parasite to enter the
host), thereby contributing to local and temporal adaptation, maternal effects and induced resistance
[29,34,48]. We suggest that future studies on host
immunity should use only Pasteuria clones that can
attach to a given clone of Daphnia so that all the variation observed is likely to originate from variation during
the proliferation step. These factors highlight the importance of controlling the host and parasite genotypes and
breaking down the infection process in order to understand the respective role of each step in host-parasite
interactions.

Resolving the infection process leads to a better
understanding of host-parasite interactions

Resolving the infection process in its sequential steps
has been proposed in a number of theoretical models
[10,11] but experimental data are scarce. Our approach
is transferable to other host-parasite systems and our
results suggest that this can provide important new
insights into host-parasite interactions and their evolution. Increasing the degree of the resolution of the infection processes highlights a universe of possibilities of the
different levels at which host and parasites interact. The
different steps might differ in how they are influenced
by the environment. They might also differ in which
sets of genes regulate them. As it is probably the case
for our study system, different steps of the infection
process might follow distinct evolutionary dynamics and
be explained by different model (for example, balancing
selection, directional selection) [10,11]. However,
because of the sequentiality of the steps, it is possible
that the selection on one might depend on the selection
on other steps. We propose that analysing infection as a
succession of well characterized steps will help to reconcile the empirical data with predictions based on alternative coevolutionary models (for example, Red Queen
and Selective Sweep models).
Spores of all P. ramosa clones tested, and which were
isolated from natural D. magna populations, were activated by all D. magna clones as well as by six other
Daphnia species (Table 3) and even a Cladoceran from
a different genus, Simocephalus vetulus. Also, apart
from the natural host, D. magna, D. dolichocephala, also
became infected following attachment of the activated
spores to the host oesophagus. This suggests that the
triggers for spore activation and, to a lesser extent, for
attachment are phylogenetically conserved. This may
facilitate the host range evolution of the parasite.
Indeed, despite its high specificity on the level of the
host clone, P. ramosa infections have been reported in
several species within the family Daphniidae [49]. It will
be necessary to test more clones of different Daphnia
species in order to determine their pattern of susceptibility and resistance to the parasite. Importantly, phylogenetically conserved steps of the infection process can
be ruled out as major factors in coevolution, but are,
perhaps, the most appropriate targets for vaccine and
drug development. In fact, the genes involved in some
infections steps have been worked out for some systems
[50,51] and can be of use in biomedicine for diseases
control [52,53].

Conclusion
Our study highlights the explanatory power of resolving
the steps of the infection process in order to better
understand host-parasite interactions and coevolution.

Attachment appears to be the crucial step for the
previously observed high specificity in the DaphniaPasteuria system and we speculate that it is the crucial
step for coevolution as observed in this system [29].
Our results reveal that each step can involve different
interactions between host, parasite and environment and
that certain steps can be phylogenetically conserved.
With this knowledge, it will be easier to apply simple
models of host-parasite interactions to this system and
identify the mechanistic basis of trade-offs, maternal
effects, genotype Ã environment interactions and coevolution. The logic of this procedure can equally be
applied to other host-parasite systems but also to study
other types of biotic interactions.

Methods
Host and parasite

We used 14 isofemale lines (hereafter referred as clones)
of D. magna and one clone each of six other Daphnia
species (Tables 1 and 3). Unless otherwise stated, Daphnia clones were kept in standard medium (ADaM, [54]
modified by using only 5% of the recommended Selenium dioxide concentration) at 20Â°C and fed with the
chemostat cultured unicellular algae, Scenedesmus
obliquus.
The parasites used were single genotypes of P. ramosa,
C1, C14 and C19, characterized as clones in Luijckx
et al. [20] and originated from D. magna populations in
Moscow (Russia), TvÃ¤rminne (Finland) and Gaarzerfeld
(Germany), respectively. Spore suspensions of Pasteuria
were obtained by homogenizing infected D. magna in
ADaM and quantifying spore density. The status of
resistant or susceptible D. magna were defined previously [20]. The infection status of two further Finnish
D. magna clones (âKela-39-09â and âKela-18-10â) exposed
to Pasteuria clones were tested with the same protocol.
All infections in these experiments were done with
naÃ¯ve individuals born to naÃ¯ve mothers, kept under
high food conditions. These conditions were applied
because they are known to minimize the triggering of
immune effect [34,35,55].
Fluorescence labelling of spores

Fluorescently labelled spores of P. ramosa were produced by homogenizing infected Daphnia in ADaM, followed by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 5 min at room
temperature. The spore pellet was suspended in 0.5 mL
of 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate (pH 9.1) containing
2.0 mg/mL of fluorescein-5(6)-isothiocyanate (F3651100MG, Sigma-Aldrich, Miss, USA), a green fluorescent
dye that stains proteins unspecifically [56]. Spores were
incubated in the dark for 2 h at room temperature with
occasional vortexing. The suspension was centrifuged
at 10 000 g for 5 min and the supernatant removed.

Duneau et al. BMC Biology 2011, 9:11
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/11

The spore pellet was suspended in distilled water and,
again, subjected to centrifugation. This process was
repeated until the supernatant was clear. Labelled spore
suspensions can be stored at 4Â°C in the dark for several
months.
The shape and location of the green labelled spores
were examined in the transparent Daphnia using a
microscope with fluorescent light (Leica DM 2500, at
magnification 200 Ã and 400 Ã) and filter cubes
Leica B/G/R (bandpass filter excitation 420/30 nm;
495/15 nm; 570/20 nm - band pass filter suppression
465/20 nm; 530/30 nm; 640/40 nm). We increased the
colour contrast by adding a red fluorescent dye to the
medium in which the Daphnia were observed. This was
done by preparing a solution of concentrated red dye
(0.05 mL of DMSO with 0.0015 g of Tetramethylrhodamin-5-isothiocyanate; T0820-5MG by Sigma-Aldrich),
which was homogenized in PBS to make the diluted dye
(1 Î¼L of concentrated solution with 10 mL of phosphate
buffered saline). We added 1 Î¼L of this solution to the
Daphnia medium 10 min before observing the Daphnia.
We obtained extended focus images using a camera
Leica DFC 300FX and the program Leica Application
Suite (Version 3.4.0, package âMontageâ).
The separation of the different steps and their specificity

Adult Daphnia were put individually in 1 mL of medium in 24-well-plates and exposed for at least 1 h to
around 17,000 labelled P. ramosa spores. Susceptible
hosts exposed to labelled spores become infected, suggesting that the dye does little or no harm to the spores
(data not shown).
Spore activation

Pilot trials revealed that the labelled spores remain in
their typical spherical shape as long as they are not in
contact with a host. Upon contact with the host phyllopods (swimming and respiratory appendages of branchiopod crustaceans), spores with a sombrero-like shape
are observed (Figure 1c and 1d). We called this process
âspore activationâ. We tested all combinations of 14
D. magna clones and three P. ramosa clones for spore
activation (Table 1). The same was done for one clone
each of six further Daphnia species but only in combination with one P. ramosa clone (Table 3). We used five
replicates for each host-parasite combination [in total
(14 Ã 3 Ã 5) + (6 Ã 1 Ã 5) = 190; details in Table 1].
Spore attachment

After exposure, Daphnia were placed on a microscopic
slide and we examined the complete Daphnia body
under a fluorescent microscope. The transparent
body of Daphnia allowed us to determine in which
body region activated fluorescent spores attach in the

Page 9 of 11

living animals. Once we determined the specific area, we
tested resistant and susceptible Daphnia magna clones
(five replicates of 14 clones, details in Table 1) for differences in attachment. The same was done with clones
of other Daphnia species (five replicates of one clone
per species; details in Table 3). In order to validate the
assignment of individuals with apparently no spores
attached to their oesophagus, we viewed the oesophagus
of slightly squashed animals at 400 Ã magnification. For
each experiment, the examiner was not informed
whether the animals belonged to a susceptible or to a
resistant clone. In order to confirm that the Daphnia
ingested spores, the gut content was inspected for the
presence of spores. All exposed animals had spores in
the faeces. We call this procedure to test for spore
attachment the âattachment-testâ.
Influence of gender and culture conditions

In order to see if the specificity pattern observed in the
attachment-test was dependent on host sex or culture
conditions, 10 host individuals of each sex were tested
in each of six treatments. This was done with D. magna
clones âKela-39-09â and âKela-18-10"âbecause these two
Daphnia clones have the reverse pattern of infectivity to
the two P. ramosa clones used and they are easily
induced to produce male and female offspring in the
laboratory. Daphnia were raised either at one of four
temperatures (10Â°C, 15Â°C, 20Â°C, 25Â°C, with high food),
two food levels (at 20Â°C, fed daily with 2.5 or 5 million
algae) or two density levels (at 20Â°C, high food level, single Daphnia or Daphnia from crowded stock cultures;
see Table 2). These conditions were chosen to represent
various environments that are common in natural
Daphnia populations. We did not employ a full factorial
design, as our interest was not in establishing reaction
norms but in testing for the influence of non-genetic
conditions in general. Daphnia of both clones raised
under these conditions were exposed to fluorescently
labelled spores of P. ramosa C1 and C19. Given the very
clear effects observed with the four combinations of
hosts and parasites used and the range of conditions
tested, we do not believe that other combinations would
drastically change our results. However, we cannot
exclude with certainty that some combinations might
lead to a different result.
Resistance or susceptibility of other Daphnia species

One clone of each of six other Daphnia species (D. arenata, D. dolichocephala, D. galeata, D. barbata, D. similis
and D. lumholtzi) were assayed for their propensity of
oesophageal spore attachment using P. ramosa clone
C19. For this assay, groups of five conspecific individuals
were exposed to 200,000 P. ramosa spores of clone C19
in 20 mL medium. Four replicates per species were used.

After 5 days we filled the jars to 100 mL and then changed the medium on a weekly basis. Animals were fed
daily with 5 to 10 million algal cells per jar depending on
the size of the Daphnia species. The infection status was
investigated under a microscope with phase contrast
(magnification 400 Ã), at host death or 29 days after
exposure.

In order to prepare Daphnia for transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), infected individuals were fixed on
ice in 4% glutaraldehyde buffer in Sorensenâs phosphate
buffer (0.1 M KH 2PO4 and 0.1 M Na2HPO4) and kept
in the dark for several hours. The animals were then
rinsed five times on ice using the same buffer for a total
of 5 min. Post-fixation was carried out with 1% OsO4 in
Sorensenâs phosphate buffer on ice. After post-fixation,
the Daphnia were again washed in Sorensenâs phosphate
buffer on ice, dehydrated in a graded acetone series, and
finally embedded in the epoxydic resin EPON.
Transversal and sagittal sections were made through
the oesophagus. Semi-thin sections (diamond knife,
0.7-1 Î¼m) were cut in order to approach the right spot
on the resin block using a RMC MT 6000-XL (RMC
Inc, AZ, USA) ultramicrotome. In order to identify
regions of interest for TEM, the tissue was stained using
Richardsonâs dye [57] and examined under a light
microscope. In order to see parasite structures using
TEM, 5-8 ultrathin sections (diamond knife, 60 nm)
were cut after every 10 semi-thin sections. The ultrathin sections were mounted on Formvar-coated copper
grids and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate to
enhance the contrast. Ultrathin sections were analysed
using a FEI Morgagniâ¢ transmission electron microscope at 80 kV equipped with a digital camera.
For scanning electron microscopy (SEM), D. magna
were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde buffer in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for 2 h at 20Â°C. Samples were washed twice
in distilled water for 5 - 10 s, dehydrated in graded ethanol series and critical point dried overnight (16 h). The
specimens were coated with gold (20 nm) and viewed
using a Philips XL 30 ESEM under high volume conditions from 5 to 15 kv.
