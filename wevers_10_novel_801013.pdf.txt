Abstract
Adenoviruses (AdV) broadly infect vertebrate hosts including a variety of primates. We identified a novel AdV in the
feces of captive gorillas by isolation in cell culture, electron microscopy and PCR. From the supernatants of infected
cultures we amplified DNA polymerase (DPOL), preterminal protein (pTP) and hexon gene sequences with generic
pan primate AdV PCR assays. The sequences in-between were amplified by long-distance PCRs of 2 - 10 kb length,
resulting in a final sequence of 15.6 kb. Phylogenetic analysis placed the novel gorilla AdV into a cluster of primate
AdVs belonging to the species Human adenovirus B (HAdV-B). Depending on the analyzed gene, its position within
the cluster was variable. To further elucidate its origin, feces samples of wild gorillas were analyzed. AdV hexon
sequences were detected which are indicative for three distinct and novel gorilla HAdV-B viruses, among them a
virus nearly identical to the novel AdV isolated from captive gorillas. This shows that the discovered virus is a
member of a group of HAdV-B viruses that naturally infect gorillas. The mixed phylogenetic clusters of gorilla,
chimpanzee, bonobo and human AdVs within the HAdV-B species indicate that host switches may have been a
component of the evolution of human and non-human primate HAdV-B viruses.
Findings
Adenoviruses are non-enveloped icosahedral doublestranded DNA viruses that infect fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals [1]. Human adenoviruses
(HAdV) are categorized into seven species (HAdV-A to
HAdV-G) [2]. Each species includes a distinct number of
serotypes [3]. In addition, intra-species shuffling of penton base, fiber and hexon genes by recombination has
been frequently observed [4-6]. Simian adenoviruses have
been discovered in monkeys and great apes [7-11]. They
are very similar to HAdV, and most of them can be
grouped into corresponding HAdV species or the newly
established species Simian adenovirus A (SAdV-A).
In 2008, a group of Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla
gorilla gorilla) suffered from prolonged diarrhea and
self-limiting respiratory disease in the Zoological gardens of Münster, Germany. To isolate viral agents
potentially responsible for the symptoms, fecal samples
were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, sterile filtered and cultured on MRC-5 cells and A549 cells.

After eight days of culture, a cytopathogenic effect was
observed. The culture supernatant was examined by
electron microscopy, and virus-like structures were
detected their size and general structure being consistent with that of adenoviruses (Additional Figure 1).
DNA was then extracted from culture supernatant
using the Qiagen tissue kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and a
generic primate adenovirus PCR was performed. For
this purpose, a nested set of degenerate and deoxyinosine-substituted (deg/dI) primers was designed, targeting
a highly conserved region of the DNA polymerase
(DPOL) gene of primate mastadenoviruses (Figure 1;
Table 1). PCR was performed in a total volume of 25 μl
with 0.2 μl AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems), 20
pmol of each primer, 200 μM dNTPs, 2 mM MgCl 2 ,
and 5% DMSO. A T-Gradient thermocycler from Biometra was used with the following cycling conditions:
95°C for 12 min, and 45 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 45°C
(1 st round and 2 nd round) for 30 sec and 72°C for
2 min, followed by a 15 min final extension step at
72°C. PCR products were purified using the Invisorb
DNA clean up kit according to the instructions of the
manufacturer (Invitek, Berlin, Germany), and directly

sequenced with the Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing
kit (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) on a 377
automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). In
BLAST analysis of GenBank, the sequence was most
closely related to chimpanzee AdVs and human AdVs of
the species HAdV-B. There was less similarity to the six
gorilla HAdV-B viruses (SAdV-27.2; SAdV-28.2; SAdV41.1; SAdV-41.2; SAdV-46; SAdV-47; Table 2) recently
described [12]. Since the novel gorilla AdV was the
seventh HAdV-B of this host, it was named for the purpose of this paper Gorilla gorilla adenovirus B7 (GgorAdV-B7).
To acquire extended sequence information of GgorAdV-B7, three additional nested PCR assays were
designed (Table 1) targeting the preterminal protein
(pTP) and two conserved regions at the 5’- and 3’-end
of the hexon gene (Figure 1). PCRs were performed as
described above, except that elongation at 72°C was for
1 min. With each primer set products of the expected
size were obtained. BLAST analysis of their sequences
also revealed a HAdV-B-like virus (not shown). To
prove that the DPOL, pTP and hexon sequences originate from the same virus, we connected them with
long-distance (LD) PCRs (Figure 1) using the TaKaRaEX PCR system according to the instructions of the

manufacturer (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan). The LD
primer pairs are listed with their annealing temperatures
in Table 1. Three overlapping PCR products were generated and sequenced by primer walking. A final contiguous sequence of 15637 bp was obtained spanning the
genes DPOL, pTP and 52 k, the genes encoding the
AdV proteins pIIIa, III (penton base), pVII, V, pX and
pVI, and the hexon gene of GgorAdV-B7 (Figure 1).
Since the AdV hexon gene is an important member of
the core gene set used for AdV classification [2,3,13,14],
we compared the available partial hexon gene of GgorAdV-B7 (2.7 kb) pair-wise with the corresponding
hexon sequences of the most closely related human and
chimpanzee HAdV-B viruses and all published gorilla
HAdV-B viruses. The highest identity percentages were
96.6% for SAdV-35.1 (chimpanzee AdV) and 96% for
HAdV-B21. The gorilla AdV SAdV-27.2, SAdV-28.2,
SAdV-41.1, SAdV-41.2, SAdV-46 and SAdV-47 revealed
only 87-91% identity. This closer relationship to HAdVB21 and SAdV-35.1 was restricted to the loop-encoding
regions 1 and 2 [15] as visible in an analysis with
the software SIMPLOT http://sray.med.som.jhmi.edu
(Figure 2). In pair-wise comparisons of DPOL and
pTP genes, GgorAdV-B7 was equally closely related to
chimpanzee and gorilla HAdV-B viruses (96-99.9%).

However, the penton base gene of GgorAdV-B7 showed
a striking similarity (99.7%) only to that of SAdV-29
(chimpanzee AdV). Using the program mVISTA http://
genome.lbl.gov/vista/index.shtml, the near-perfect match
of the GgorAdV-B7 and SAdV-29 penton base genes
over the entire gene length is clearly visible (Figure 3).
With the PhyML plug-in 2.0.1 of the Geneious Pro
5.0.4 software, phylogenetic trees were constructed on
the basis of hexon, DPOL, pTP and penton base gene
alignments (Figures 4). All published, completely
sequenced HAdV-B viruses were included. In the
hexon-based tree, GgorAdV-B7 clustered with HAdVB21, SAdV-35.1 (chimpanzee AdV) and SAdV-35.2
(bonobo AdV) (Figure 4a). DPOL and pTP analyses
placed GgorAdV-B7 into a tight cluster of gorilla and
chimpanzee AdVs (Figure 4b and 4c). In the tree
derived from the penton base, GgorAdV-B7 branched
separately, nearly at the same position as SAdV-29

(Figure 4d). With the MrBayes 2.0.2 plug-in (Geneious
Pro) or the Neighbor-Joining module of MacVector
10.6, trees with the same AdV clusters and similarly
supported topology were obtained (data not shown).
The remarkably close relatedness of GgorAdV-B7 to
chimpanzee AdVs (SAdV-29 and 35.1) prompted us to
investigate whether gorillas naturally host GgorAdV-B7.
For this purpose, we examined wild Western lowland
gorillas (Gorilla. g. gorilla) from Gabon and additional
captive gorillas. Fecal samples were collected from 19
individuals in a remote area with little human presence
in Loango National Park, Gabon. They originated from
fresh nest sites or were freshly found on gorilla paths
[16]. Samples were collected using single-use gloves and
preserved by drying over silica. DNA was extracted following a previously described method [17]. In addition,
ten necropsy samples (spleen, liver, pancreas, lymph
node, tonsil, lung, kidney, urine) and one plasma sample

were collected from four deceased captive gorillas in the
Zoological gardens of Berlin as well as six fecal samples
from three captive gorillas in the Zoological gardens of
Münster, Germany. To test for the presence of HAdV-B
viruses, we set up a nested PCR (PCR Hex-loop2; Table 1)
which targets flanking sequences of a hyper variable
region (loop 2) in the hexon gene (Figure 1) and amplifies 380 bp. The primers were deduced from HAdV-B
sequences only and not degenerated. A total of 36 gorilla samples were screened. AdV DNA was only detected
in feces (5/19 wild gorilla samples and 4/6 captive gorilla samples). In total, 9/25 fecal samples were PCRpositive (36%), and the products sequenced. Most
importantly, a virus apparently identical to GgorAdVB7 was identified in a wild gorilla from Gabon. Three
additional HAdV-B viruses were also detected. Two
were without close similarities to any published AdV
sequence. The third one was nearly identical to the gorilla AdVs SAdV-27.2 and SAdV-47, which had been

originally isolated from captive individuals [12]. They
were tentatively named GgorAdV-B8, -B9 and -B10.
GgorAdV-B8 was detected in two fecal samples from
wild gorillas in Gabon and in one sample from Münster.
Its hexon sequence revealed the highest percentage of
identity (86.5%) to SAdV-21 (chimpanzee HAdV-B).
GgorAdV-B9 was only amplified from captive gorillas
(two fecal samples from Münster) and showed 88% identity to SAdV-29 (chimpanzee HAdV-B). The GgorAdVB7 to -B10 Hex-loop2 sequences and closely related
sequences of published gorilla, chimpanzee, bonobo and
human HAdV-B viruses were subjected to phylogenetic
analysis as described above. In the tree, the HAdV-B
viruses segregate into several subclades with members of
two, three or four host species (human, chimpanzee,
bonobo and gorilla) (Figure 5). This mixed clustering was
also observed upon analysis of the nearly complete hexon
gene (2.7 kb; Figure 4a) with GgorAdV-B7 only. It was
partially visible in the penton base tree (Figure 4d) and

entirely absent from the DPOL and pTP trees (Figures 4b
and 4c). In addition, the phylogenetic position of a given
primate AdV frequently differed, depending on the analyzed gene (compare Figures 4a to 4d).
Taken together, these observations cannot be
explained by co-speciation. Rather, they are in line with
recombination and host switching. Such events have
been previously discussed to be involved in the evolution of human AdV, because intra-species shuffling of
penton base, fiber and hexon genes has been frequently
observed [4-6]. In addition, a recombinant between
viruses of the sub-clades HAdV-B1 and HAdV-B2 has
been isolated from a captive chimpanzee [12]. Here, a
close similarity of GgorAdV-B7 to SAdV-29 (complete
sequence, excluding hexon loops) and to SAdV-35.1
(hexon loops) was observed (Figure 2). However, since
in the loop region the nucleic acid identity between
GgorAdV-B7 and SAdV-35.1 was well below 100%, it is
unlikely that the existing AdVs are parent viruses in a
recent recombination event giving rise to GgorAdV-B7.
Rather, a more ancient one with subsequent genetic
drift may have been involved or recombination with an
unknown AdV, as suggested for HAdV-A18 [18].

Shuffling of genes by recombination between AdVs
that naturally infect different host species (e.g., great ape
and human AdVs) but under certain conditions coinfect the same host, may be an additional mechanism
by which AdVs exchange genetic information. This
could occur in places where contacts between humans
and apes are frequent like in zoos and animal facilities.
In addition, people who are involved in hunting primates and preparation of bush meat [19] are at risk to
be infected. So far, infections of humans with nonhuman primate (NHP) AdVs have not been observed.
Nevertheless, antibodies with specificity for chimpanzee
HAdV-C viruses have been detected in humans from
Sub-Saharan Africa and were significantly less frequent
in people from the United States of America and
Thailand [20]. In addition, the species HAdV-E comprises only one human serotype but more than 12 great
ape serotypes. Therefore, the human HAdV-E was
thought to be the result of a zoonotic transmission from
chimpanzees to humans [21]. The gorilla AdV described
in the present study (GgorAdV-B7) is highly similar to
chimpanzee AdVs. Thus, a transmission event between
chimpanzees and gorillas was possibly involved which is

further indication for the potential of AdVs to jump
between closely related hosts.
Very little is known about the pathogenic properties of
NHP-AdV. GgorAdV-B7 was originally discovered in a
group of gorillas suffering from prolonged diarrhea and
self-limiting respiratory infection. Since human species
B AdV have been linked to respiratory diseases [22-24],
an etiological association of GgorAdV-B7 with the
observed respiratory symptoms is possible. However,
recent studies reported the frequent shedding of AdVs
in the feces of healthy captive chimpanzees and gorillas
[12,25]. Therefore, further investigations are needed.
Knowledge about the spectrum of AdV in wild great
apes in general [25] is very limited. Specifically from
wild gorillas, no information has been published.
Although examining only a small set of samples, our
findings show that AdV infecting captive gorillas can
readily be found in wild animals (GgorAdV-B7; GgorAdV-B8). This is a good example of how humans may
be brought into contact with new pathogens, not only
locally through bushmeat hunting in regions where
NHP live naturally, but also in other regions of the
world where NHP are housed in zoos.

The high variety of known and novel HAdV-B viruses in
great apes calls for larger studies to understand the diversity of AdVs currently circulating in African NHP as well
as in local human populations. It is justified to assume that
such studies will improve our insight into the zoonotic
potential of adenoviruses and possibly answer the intriguing question whether AdVs of non-human primates
have already contributed to the human “adeno-virosphere”.
