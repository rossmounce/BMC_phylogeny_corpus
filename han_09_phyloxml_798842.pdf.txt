Abstract
Background: Evolutionary trees are central to a wide range of biological studies. In many of these
studies, tree nodes and branches need to be associated (or annotated) with various attributes. For
example, in studies concerned with organismal relationships, tree nodes are associated with
taxonomic names, whereas tree branches have lengths and oftentimes support values. Gene trees
used in comparative genomics or phylogenomics are usually annotated with taxonomic
information, genome-related data, such as gene names and functional annotations, as well as events
such as gene duplications, speciations, or exon shufflings, combined with information related to the
evolutionary tree itself. The data standards currently used for evolutionary trees have limited
capacities to incorporate such annotations of different data types.
Results: We developed a XML language, named phyloXML, for describing evolutionary trees, as
well as various associated data items. PhyloXML provides elements for commonly used items, such
as branch lengths, support values, taxonomic names, and gene names and identifiers. By using
"property" elements, phyloXML can be adapted to novel and unforeseen use cases. We also
developed various software tools for reading, writing, conversion, and visualization of phyloXML
formatted data.
Conclusion: PhyloXML is an XML language defined by a complete schema in XSD that allows
storing and exchanging the structures of evolutionary trees as well as associated data. More
information about phyloXML itself, the XSD schema, as well as tools implementing and supporting
phyloXML, is available at http://www.phyloxml.org.

Background
Information that can be interpreted in a phylogenetic context is growing rapidly in both types and quantities, due to
the advancement of large-scale studies such as metagenomics and phylogenomics [1,2]. Current formats for
describing evolutionary trees are becoming increasingly
inappropriate. The main limitation of present formats is
the lack of standardized means to annotate tree nodes and

branches with distinct attributes. In the case of species
trees, these attributes are taxonomic names, branch
lengths, and often (possibly multiple) support values
(such as bootstrap values or posterior probabilities). Gene
trees used in comparative genomics and phylogenomics
applications additionally require fields for gene identifiers
and potentially gene duplication events [3], whereas trees
used in phylogeographic [4] applications require fields for

geographic data. While some existing formats such as
Nexus [5] or NHX (New Hampshire eXtended) [6,7] allow
describing additional information associated with phylogenetic trees, these formats have been shown to be problematic in the extensibility or the interoperability as a
standard. The complexity of the Nexus format has led to
different parsers that only understand a subset of the format, and different programs that produce poorly formed
outputs (although a XML based replacement for the
Nexus format, named "NeXML", is being developed and is
expected to alleviate problems stemming from the complexity of the Nexus format [8]). The NHX format, built as
an adhoc extension to the Newick (New Hampshire)
standard [9] has limits in the types of information it can
incorporate, since it has been developed with one primary
use case in mind - representing gene trees with inferred
gene duplication events [3]. Previous proposals for a XML
format for systematic data [10] never gained popularity,
possibly due to a lack of supporting software.
Here we describe phyloXML, a new standardized format
for phylogenetic documents that is based on the formal
language of XML [11] and which is inspired by the XML
tree representation described in [12] (this XML format is
used as output format by the "Retree" program from the
PHYLIP package [9]).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/356

while it is also easy to expand the vocabulary of the
schema without disrupting existing usage. Because the format is defined by a XML schema, phyloXML is also easy to
validate and process. The structure of the document is
readily parsed by any existing XML parser, while interpreting the content needs to be implemented depending on
the use case. Because of the restrictive nature of the XML
schema, unambiguous "well-formed" and "valid" documents will facilitate greater data exchange among users
and programs that was not feasible before.
Similar to NHX, and unlike Nexus, the structure of phyloXML is phylogeny oriented rather than character oriented. The basic structure of a phyloXML document is a
hierarchical cluster of recursive clades. Each clade corresponds to a node, and the set of clades that congregate at
the root compose a phylogeny. Each clade element can
also enclose nested elements that are annotations to the
containing clade. This kind of hierarchical representation
of the phylogeny and its corresponding annotations in
each level is not only intuitive, but also naturally suitable
for a description by XML. The following is an example of
a phyloXML document describing a simple gene tree with
three external nodes (for more examples, [see Additional
file 1]).
<phylogeny rooted="true">

Implementation
Along with the complete schema in XSD that defines the
format of phyloXML, a number of tools have been implemented to support the reading and writing of phyloXML.
The Java command-line tools "phyloxml_converter" can
convert existing formats (Nexus, Newick/New Hampshire, and NHX) into phyloXML, and "decorator" helps
the users insert various data types into a phyloXML tree.
There are multiple tree-viewing programs that support the
format, including Archaeopteryx [13] (the successor to the
tree display tool ATV [7]) and TreeViewJ [14]. Furthermore, Archaeopteryx allows the user to easily convert phyloXML to Nexus, Newick/New Hampshire, and NHX and
vice versa. So far, phyloXML support has been developed
for three open source libraries for computational molecular biology and bioinformatics, namely BioPerl [15]
(module Bio::TreeIO::phyloxml), BioRuby (module
Bio::PhyloXML) [16], and Biopython (module
Bio.Tree.PhyloXML) [17]. The XSD schema and links to
supporting applications, together with more complex
examples of phyloXML can be found at http://www.phy
loxml.org.

Results and Discussion
PhyloXML is general, with over 20 different elements that
encompass an extensive range of information (such as
confidence values, sequence, and taxonomic data) that
could be added to phylogenies. PhyloXML is extensible,
containing legitimate grammar for user-defined contents,

Application specific data types that are not covered by the
schema are supported by phyloXML, explicitly as reserved
<property> elements, as well as extensions that can be
defined by the user. <property> provides an interface for
custom typed and referenced data. The <property> elements can be applied to the <phylogeny> itself, the
<clade>, or the parent branch inherent in each clade. The
recursive structure has no bound for depth or breadth,
and the same element can be attached to a node multiple
times with different values as long as it complies with the
schema. For example, phylogenies that are built as a consensus of multiple approaches can have multiple <confidence> elements attached to the same clade to describe
the support values resulting from the different methods.
Molecular sequence can be easily associated with a certain
<clade> by the <sequence> element, and not only the raw
sequence data but also complex annotations can be added
to the sequence using <annotation>, <sequence_relation>
(used to describe orthologous and paralogous relations,
for example) and <domain architecture>. Table 1
describes some of the elements that are supported to
annotate evolutionary trees.

While the most straightforward structure of the document
is the hierarchy of nested clades that automatically
describes the topology of the phylogeny, it is also possible
to describe the topology in a flat manner using the
attributes id_ref and id_source. Id_source is an optional
attribute that assigns a unique id to a <clade>, <taxonomy> or a <sequence>. Elements with an attribute of
id_ref will be associated with the specific element that has
the same value of id_source identifier. Using id_ref and
id_source provides much flexibility in the structure of the
document, and allows the representation of network
topologies that cannot be represented with a hierarchical
structure.
In the following, we compare and contrast key features of
the phyloXML standard with those of the NeXML format
currently being developed [8]. One significant difference
between phyloXML and NeXML is that phyloXML provides predefined elements for data elements commonly
used in phylogenetics, phylogenomics, and comparative
genomics (such as elements for taxonomic and sequence
information). In contrast, NeXML (in its most current ver-

sion as of this writing) approaches this by providing meta
elements which are intended to be compliant with RDFa
recommendations so that they can be expanded to RDF
triples by an XSL stylesheet [18,19]. This mechanism
essentially allows expandable key/value attachments for
various elements of an evolutionary tree, which are mediated by ontologies and which can be expanded to RDF.
The obvious advantage of such an approach lies in its flexibility and in the fact that it allows representing unforeseen types of data and lends itself well to knowledge
integration. On the other hand, different producers of
NeXML formatted data might represent common data elements differently, in particular if they rely on different
ontologies or if no commonly used ontology has yet been
established for the problem domain, thus hampering the
stated goal of interoperability for documents containing

phylogenetic trees annotated with more than just basic
OTUs (NeXML)/clade names (phyloXML). Due to the fact
that phyloXML provides predefined elements, interoperability for documents containing commonly used types of
data is guaranteed. Another advantage of explicitly modelling common elements in the XSD schema versus relying on key/value attachments mediated by ontologies is
that this approach does not introduce dependencies on
additional resources. To achieve the flexibility to represent
data not modelled in the current XSD schema, phyloXML
employs a two pronged strategy. Firstly, <property> elements can be used to store data not covered by the current
schema. In fact, the "ref" attribute of <property> elements
allows for mediation by ontologies, very similar to the
approach used in NeXML. Secondly, XML is inherently
extensible thus allowing the incorporation of data from

other XML languages as well as extension of the phyloXML standard itself (in the form of future versions).
Another difference between phyloXML and NeXML is in
the structure of data representation. In NeXML, the data
associated with the nodes are separated out of the tree into
a tabulated structure; while in PhyloXML all the data associated with the nodes are within the tree structure itself.
For this reason, the NeXML lends itself well to statistical
approaches where the user treats the data as a list of samples. PhyloXML is convenient to use in algorithmic procedures where the data associated with the nodes are
updated through multiple iterations of tree traversing, e.g.
Expectation-Maximization across the tree. This difference
is more of interest to the software developer who needs to
think of how the data should be structured. Of course,
both formats can ultimately be parsed and stored into any
type of data structure, but one may be more suited for and
easier to handle in certain approaches than the other. A
third key difference between the two formats is that
NeXML, like NEXUS, attempts to model all elements associated with phylogenetic inference, such as characters
(molecular sequences, categorical data or continuous
data), substitution models, and evolutionary trees. PhyloXML, in contrast, focuses on evolutionary trees with
associated data only, thus simplifying the creation of compliant parsers and corresponding data structures.

phyloXML, extensibility as well as domain specific applications are ensured.

Since phyloXML was not devised as input format for phylogeny inference software, we decided not to provide the
means to store multiple sequence alignments as separate
elements. In its current version (1.10, as of this writing),
phyloXML only allows storing aligned molecular
sequences via the <molecular_sequence> sub-element of
<sequence> (with the "is_aligned" attribute set to "true").
Due to the extensible nature of XML, it is straightforward
to add additional elements and sub-elements in future
versions of phyloXML depending on user needs, without
running into compatibility issues with existing software
implementations.

We also developed a number of software applications to
read, write, convert to and from, and visualize phyloXML
formatted data. Furthermore, phyloXML is supported by
the BioPerl [15], BioRuby [16], and Biopython [17] open
source libraries. In practice, phyloXML has already proven
valuable in research on regulatory network evolution
[20,21]. In these studies evolutionary tree nodes were
associated with such distinct data fields as taxonomic
information, protein names, protein functions, domainarchitectures, and gene duplications. PhyloXML provided
a convenient and transparent means to store, visualize,
and analyze these data in a phylogenetic context, leading
to new biological insights.

We developed phyloXML, an XML language designed to
describe phylogenetic trees and associated data. PhyloXML provides elements for commonly used features,
such as taxonomic information, gene names and identifiers, branch lengths, support values, and gene duplication
and speciation events. Using these standardized elements
allows interoperability between various applications and
databases. Furthermore, both due to extensible nature of
