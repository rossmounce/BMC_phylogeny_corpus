Abstract
Background: rRNA adenine dimethyltransferases, represented by the Escherichia coli KsgA
protein, are highly conserved phylogenetically and are generally not essential for growth. They are
responsible for the post-transcriptional transfer of two methyl groups to two universally conserved
adenosines located near the 3'end of the small subunit rRNA and participate in ribosome
maturation. All sequenced genomes of Chlamydia reveal a ksgA homolog in each species, including
C. trachomatis. Yet absence of a S-adenosyl-methionine synthetase in Chlamydia, the conserved
enzyme involved in the synthesis of the methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine, raises a doubt
concerning the activity of the KsgA homolog in these organisms.
Results: Lack of the dimethylated adenosines following ksgA inactivation confers resistance to
kasugamycin (KSM) in E. coli. Expression of the C. trachomatis L2 KsgA ortholog restored KSM
sensitivity to the E. coli ksgA mutant, suggesting that the chlamydial KsgA homolog has specific rRNA
dimethylase activity. C. trachomatis growth was sensitive to KSM and we were able to isolate a KSM
resistant mutant of C. trachomatis containing a frameshift mutation in ksgA, which led to the
formation of a shorter protein with no activity. Growth of the C. trachomatis ksgA mutant was
negatively affected in cell culture highlighting the importance of the methylase in the development
of these obligate intracellular and as yet genetically intractable pathogens.
Conclusion: The presence of a functional rRNA dimethylase enzyme belonging to the KsgA family
in Chlamydia presents an excellent chemotherapeutic target with real potential. It also confirms the
existence of S-adenosyl-methionine - dependent methylation reactions in Chlamydia raising the
question of how these organisms acquire this cofactor.

Background
Ribosomes are complex macromolecular machines that
are found in abundance in all cells that are actively making proteins. Two-thirds of the ribosome is composed of
RNA molecules (rRNA) that share a high degree of conservation in primary sequence as well as in secondary and

tertiary structural elements across kingdoms [1]. Numerous nucleotide modifications, mainly but not exclusively
via methylation, are found on rRNAs but the functional
importance of these post-transcriptional modifications
remains unclear [2]. For example, the two adenosine residues in the loop of helix 45 near the 3'end of the small

subunit rRNA (positions 1518 and 1519 of the 16S rRNA
in the Escherichia coli numbering system) are universally
conserved, and are dimethylated by a specific enzyme
belonging to the rRNA adenine dimethylase family, which
is represented by the E. coli KsgA protein [3]. While these
enzymes are present in all three kingdoms of life including mitochondria and chloroplasts [4], a few KsgA
orthologs adopted additional roles within the cell, serving
for example as a transcription factor in mitochondria [5]
or an essential ribosome biogenesis factor in yeast [6].
However, dimethylation is generally not essential for
growth at optimal temperature.
The order Chlamydiales forms a deep lineage of obligate
intracellular bacteria, infecting free-living amoebae, various invertebrates and all the vertebrates, and includes four
families: Chlamydiaceae, Parachlamydiaceae, Waddliaceae,
and Simkaniaceae [7]. The Chlamydiaceae are well known
agents of multiple diseases in animals and in humans,
with two species, C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae, being
pathogenic for humans. C. trachomatis is recognized as the
most prevalent cause of bacterial sexually transmitted
infections worldwide and, in underdeveloped nations, is
also responsible for trachoma a potentially blinding disease. C. pneumoniae is a significant agent of respiratory disease in adolescents and adults and also is associated with
cardiovascular diseases. The other chlamydial species are
less relevant to human medicine, although severe
zoonotic diseases in humans are caused by C. psittaci, C.
abortus and C. felis. Species of Parachlamydiaceae, Waddliaceae, and Simkaniaceae are also suspected to be involved
in human infections [8].
In addition to being obligate intracellular Gram-negative
bacteria, all chlamydiales share a unique biphasic developmental cycle. The environmentally stable, metabolically inert and infectious elementary bodies (EBs) enter
susceptible host cells and convert into the replicating and
metabolically active but noninfectious reticulate bodies
(RBs) inside cytoplasmic vacuoles (also called inclusions)
before converting back into EBs from 18 to 48 hours postinfection depending on the species, and exiting the host
cell to repeat the cycle [9]. While effective antibiotic therapies are available to treat chlamydial infections, it is
becoming clear that the low number of rRNA operons in
these bacteria presents an actual risk for emergence of
resistance against the current preferred therapies of tetracycline or azithromycin [10,11]. Then, similar to other
bacteria, targets for the development of new antimicrobials need to be identified.
The evolution of Chlamydia as an obligate intracellular
pathogen has been associated with loss of genes encoding
functions that became redundant within the host during
the adaptation to parasitic/symbiotic lifestyles, similarly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/279

to mycoplasmas, phytoplasmas, α- and γ-proteobacteria
[12]. Sequencing data available for eleven Chlamydia species reveal the presence of a KsgA dimethyltransferase
homolog, yet they all lack the S-adenosyl-methionine synthetase that is required for synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine, the donor of methyl groups in all methylation reactions. This raises the question of whether the ksgA
homolog encodes a functional methylase in these organisms. The lack of tools for genetically manipulating
Chlamydia has been a major barrier to the analysis of their
putative virulence genes [13] and characterization of
chlamydial genes has mainly relied on expression in a heterologous host system such as E. coli. In this study, we
show that the chlamydial KsgA protein is able to functionally replace the orthologous enzyme in E. coli, indicating
that they share the same activity, i.e. specific methylation
of the small subunit ribosomal RNA. KsgA activity conferred sensitivity to the antibiotic kasugamycin (KSM) in
Chlamydia, similarily to E. coli, and we were able to isolate
low level KSMR mutants in C. trachomatis which contain a
frameshift mutation in ksgA. These mutant bacteria were
severely impaired for growth, highlighting the critical role
KsgA plays in Chlamydia biology.

Results and discussion
1-Characterization of the chlamydial KsgA orthologs and
their phylogenetic relationship with other family members
A gene encoding a protein highly similar to the dimethyltransferase KsgA is present in the genomes of all
sequenced Chlamydia. Using degenerate primers, we were
amplified a 5 kb-genomic region of C. psittaci 6BC carrying the ksgA-like gene. ksgA is the second gene of a predicted bicistronic operon in Chlamydia [14], downstream
of a gene, named ct355 in C. trachomatis serovar D, with
no homology outside the chlamydiae lineage. CT355 ORF
shows 59 to 100% homology amongst the Chlamydiacee
and 26% with the protochlamydial pc0396 ORF which
precedes the protochlamydial ksgA gene.

Genomic transcriptional profiling of C. trachomatis serovar D showed that both ksgA and ct355 genes are transcribed by 8 hours post-infection when the bacteria are in
the metabolically active stage of development [15]. Surprisingly, while most ksgA orthologs use the AUG canonical translation initiation codon, an alternative ksgA start
codon is predicted amongst the Chlamydiaceae, either
GUG in C. trachomatis, C. muridarum and C. pneumoniae or
UUG in C. psittaci 6BC, C. felis, C. caviae and C. abortus.
While use of an alternative start codon usually results in
low expression in E. coli, its impact on efficiency of translation in Chlamydia is not known. Nevertheless like E. coli,
most chlamydial genes rely on AUG as a start codon [16].
A multiway alignment between various KsgA homologs
revealed 62 to 68% identity amongst the Chlamydiaceae

and at least 99% within each species, 39% with the protochlamydial homolog, 25 to 30% with Arabidaposis thaliana, Synechococcus sp., Prochlorococcus sp., E. coli, Rickettsia
sp. and Yersinia sp. KsgA orthologs, and 20% with the
mitochondrial transcriptional factor h-mtTFB1 (data not
shown). Using a refined sequence alignment, a phylogenetic tree was constructed for these various dimethyltransferases [17] (see Materials and Methods). The branches
representing Chlamydia were similar whether nucleotide
sequences (data not shown) or protein sequences (Figure
1) were aligned. They were both comparable to the one

obtained using 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA gene sequences
[18] or housekeeping gene fragments [19], except that C.
pneumoniae was slightly more distant in our analysis, with
a strong branch support value of 86%.
The chlamydial KsgA homologs, in particular the protochlamydial one, grouped with the A. thaliania chloroplastic
PFC1 (Paleface1) protein, in agreement with two recent
studies [4,20] (Figure 1). Although the evolutionary relationship between plants and Chlamydia may seem surprising considering that no species of Chlamydia has been

reported in photosynthetic organisms, a high number of
cyanobacteria- and plant-like genes in Chlamydia have
been identified in the different chlamydial genome
sequences [21,22]. Further analyses showed that many of
the plant orthologs are targeted to the plastids in plants.
We recently demonstrated that C. trachomatis L2 and P.
amoebophila DapL enzymes behave similarly to the phylogenetically related plant plastidial LL-diaminopimelate
aminotransferase enzyme involved in the lysine biosynthetic pathway [23]. Accordingly, we predict that the
chlamydial KsgA proteins should be functionally equiva-

lent to the plastid orthologs. In addition, conservation of
hallmark sequences for binding to the methyl group
donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine and to the adenine ring
of the nucleotide to be methylated (Figure 2) predict that
the chlamydial KsgA proteins should complement a KsgA
defect in E. coli, as seen previously with KsgA family members [5,24-27].

2-Complementation of a ksgA mutant of E. coli by the
chlamydial ksgA homologs
E. coli are naturally sensitive to KSM, an aminoglycoside
antibiotic that inhibits the initial step of protein synthesis.
Sensitivity to KSM is in part due to the action of KsgA
which methylates the adenosine residues at positions
1518 and 1519 of the 16S rRNA. [Note that we use the E.
coli numbering system throughout when referring to
nucleotide(s) in rRNA genes]. Consequently, ksgA
mutants are resistant to KSM [28]. We constructed a clean
deletion of ksgA in E. coli MC4100 (Table 1) using the λ
red recombinase method as described by Datensko and
Wanner [29]. This strain, ATM809, was 16 times more
resistant to KSM than the wild-type strain, with a minimal
inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2500 μg ml-1 vs. 150 μg
ml-1 for its parent (Table 1). The ability of E. coli and C.
trachomatis L2 ksgA genes to complement the KSM resistance phenotype and restore KSM sensitivity to ATM809
was first tested by transforming high copy number plasmids (Table 1) and expressing the respective genes in the
presence of 1 mM Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG). Colonies formed by ATM809 transformed with
pRAK316 (i.e. overexpressing C. trachomatis L2 KsgA protein, designated KsgAL2 for simplicity) were about 50%
smaller than ATM809 or ATM809 transformed with
pRAK297 (i.e. overexpressing the E. coli protein) (p <
0.0001 by t-test). The inhibition of growth due to overexpression of KsgAL2 made it impractical to assess sensitivity
to KSM. To address this problem we constructed isogenic
strains of ATM809 in which the copy number of the IPTGinducible ksgA gene was reduced by inserting it into the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/279

chromosome at the λ-attachment site (Material and Methods). Under such conditions, we did not observe any
growth inhibition associated with KsgAL2 expression in
the absence of antibiotic (p > 0.1 by t-test).
Expression of the native E. coli methylase in the E. coli ksgA
mutant (i.e. ATM810) restored sensitivity to KSM as
expected (Figure 3), with a MIC of 150 μg ml-1 (Table 1).
Similarly, expression of KsgAL2 was able to complement
for the loss of ksgA in E. coli (Figure 3). As expected, the
level of bacterial sensitivity to KSM was inversely related
to the expected expression level of the recombinant protein in E. coli, lowering the MIC from 800 to 400 μg ml-1
when the ksgAL2 GUG native start codon was replaced by
the conventional AUG start codon to increase the level of
expression of KsgAL2 (Table 1). Likewise expression of the
C. psittaci 6BC KsgA ortholog restored KSM sensitivity to
the E. coli ksgA mutant (Table 1). The restoration of KSM
sensitivity supports the conclusion that the chlamydial
KsgA homologs are able to methylate the two conserved
adenosines at positions 1518 and 1519 in E. coli 16S
rRNA in vivo, as has been seen previously for different
KsgA family members from mitochondria, bacteria and
yeasts [24,25,27,30,31].
The importance of KsgA in ribosome maturation has been
linked to the cold-sensitivity phenotype described for E.
coli ksgA mutants and A. thaliana pfc1 mutants [32,33].
Nevertheless expression of KsgAL2 in ATM809 did not
reverse the cold-sensitivity growth of the E. coli strain (Figure 4). We do not know if this reflects a functional dispar-

KSM inhibition growth of E. coli ATM809 derivatives
KSM inhibition growth of E. coli ATM809 derivatives. A ksgA mutant of E. coli (i.e. ATM809) harboring a chromosomal
copy of ksgA from E. coli (ATM810), C. trachomatis L2 (ATM811, ATM812) or the KSM resistant C. trachomatis L2ksgAE9
(ATM815) were tested for resistance to KSM as described in [30], with some modifications. The A600 of cultures after 24 hrs of
growth in the presence of the indicated amounts of KSM was normalized to the value obtained for ATM809 under the same
conditions. Data points represent the mean ± s.d. of three experiments. The parent MC4100 behaved like ATM810 and was

ity of the chlamydial KsgA homolog or just results from
partial heterologous complementation suggested by the
intermediate level of KSM sensitivity exhibited by the
ksgAL2-complemented E. coli mutants. Nevertheless, the
ability of KsgAL2 to restore some degree of sensitivity
towards KSM, hence methylation of A1518 and A1519 in E.
coli 16S rRNA, suggests that the same conserved adenosine
residues are methylated in Chlamydia [3,6,33-36]. Consequently, we explored Chlamydia sensitivity to KSM.
3-Inhibition of C. trachomatis L2 and C. psittaci 6BC
growth by KSM and selection of resistant mutants
Although KSM has been used clinically in the treatment of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections [37], this aminoglycoside antibiotic is only currently used in agricultural protection of rice crops against the fungus Pyricularia oryzae.
Genetic, biochemical, and structural analyses have provided insights into KSM binding and inhibition [38-42].

The drug binds to the 30S ribosomal subunits within the
path of the messenger RNA (mRNA), overlapping both
the peptidyl-tRNA (P) and exit (E) sites. This affects the
binding of the initiator tRNA onto canonical mRNAs and
the subsequent joining of the large 50S subunits to form
the translationally active 70S ribosomes. KSM is held in
place by interactions with universally conserved residues
A794 and G926 on the 16S rRNA and although the antibiotic does not appear to interact directly with the two adenosines at positions 1518 and 1519, lack of methylation
in A1519 decreases KSM binding to rRNA. [39,40]. The conservation of these nucleotides in Chlamydia predicts that
these obligate intracellular bacteria should be sensitive to
KSM, provided that both the cell and the inclusion membrane are permeable to the drug.
In our laboratory, sensitivity of Chlamydia spp. to antibiotics is measured in the plaque assay and the MIC is

Growth efficiency of various E. coli ATM809 derivatives at 30°C (panel A) and 20°C (panel B). Exponential cultures diluted in 10-fold increments were spotted on LB supplemented with IPTG and incubated at 30°C for 12 hrs and 20°C
for 30 hrs.

defined as the concentration of drug that inhibits the
development of 105 plaque-forming units (PFU). The
number of input bacteria corresponds to a multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 0.01 in a confluent monolayer of L2
mouse fibroblasts in 60 mm dishes [10,11,13]. Due to
low intracellular penetration, aminoglycosides are considered poorly active or not active against obligate intracellular bacteria and indeed C. psittaci 6BC and C. trachomatis
L2 MIC for KSM were high, i.e. 1100 and 800 μg ml-1,
respectively (Table 1). Although such elevated MICs
would classify the organisms as KSM resistant from a clinical stand point, we hypothesized that alterations in the
drug binding site, in the KsgA methylase or in the rRNA
methylation site would allow Chlamydia to grow in the
presence of even higher concentrations of KSM, as
reported for other bacteria [28,38,43,44].
When monolayers were infected with 106 to 107 PFU in
the presence of KSM at 2000, 3000 or 5000 μg ml-1, resistant plaques appeared at a frequency of 2.20 ± 0.64 × 10-5

for C. psittaci 6BC while no plaques were seen for C. trachomatis under the same conditions (frequency <5.3 × 108). We have previously observed this difference in behavior between the two chlamydial strains for acquisition of
resistance towards other ribosome targeting antibiotics
[10,11]. Because expression of resistance requires that
more than 50% of the ribosome population be of the
resistant phenotype, C. trachomatis with two rRNA operons is at a disadvantage compared to C. psittaci 6BC which
harbors only one rRNA operon. KSM started to affect C.
trachomatis L2 growth at 100 μg ml-1, but a concentration
of 200 μg ml-1 was completely inhibitory when cells were
infected with a few hundred PFUs. Therefore we reasoned
that serial passage in subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotic would allow the enrichment of putative low level
KSMR bacteria, as previously seen for azithromycin [10].
Three independent cultures of C. trachomatis L2 were passaged up to 14 times in KSM ranging from 100 to 800 μg
ml-1. Three individual clones were then selected and purified in the plaque assay using 300 μg KSM ml-1.

4-Molecular and phenotypic characterizations of KSM
resistance mutations in C. psittaci 6BC and C.
trachomatis L2
Sixteen independent spontaneous KSMR plaques were isolated for C. psittaci 6BC, expanded twice in the presence of
2000 μg KSM ml-1 and further analyzed. DNA sequence
analysis showed that none carried a mutation in ksgA.
However, sequencing of the unique 16S rRNA gene
revealed an A to G mutation at position 794 which is
known as one of the binding sites for KSM [39,40]. Similarly, three C. trachomatis L2 isolates that arose in the presence of 300 μg KSM ml-1 were further expanded in the
presence of the drug and analyzed. None carried a mutation in the drug binding sites as expected from the presence of two rRNA operons in the strain [45]. None carried
a mutation in rpsI encoding the 30S ribosomal subunit S9
protein that is a target for KSM resistance [46]. Sequencing
of the ksgAL2 DNA region revealed the insertion of a tg
nucleotide doublet in the last third of the gene. This doublet base-pair insertion, likely the result of a replication
slippage [47], creates an early in-frame stop codon in the
ksgA coding sequence, resulting in the expression of a
KsgA variant of 213 residues instead of 277 (Figure 2).

Stability of the acquired phenotype was then tested on
one representative mutant of both classes (Table 1) by
growth in the absence of selective pressure (i.e. no KSM).
Plaques formed by the C. psittaci 6BC BCK1 and the C. trachomatis L2 ksgAE9 variants grown for a minimum of 14
days in the absence of selection displayed the same
number of infectious particles when titered in the presence or absence of 2000 and 200 μg KSM ml-1, respectively, indicating that the resistance phenotype was stable
(data not shown). Growth of C. psittaci BCK1 was not
affected by 5 mg KSM ml-1, the highest concentration of
KSM that was not toxic to the mouse fibroblast cells. On
the other hand, plaques formed by C. trachomatis ksgAE9
were already smaller in the presence of 200 μg ml-1 KSM,
while 3 mg ml-1 of the drug inhibited at least 105 ksgAE9
PFUs (i.e. MIC) (Table 1). The moderate level (i.e. less
than 4-fold) of KSM resistance conferred by mutations in
ksgA likely precluded C. psittaci 6BC ksgA mutants from
being selected directly in the plaque assay [10,11].
High level KSM resistance associated with mutations in
the drug binding sites has only been observed previously
in engineered strains of E. coli [38] and B. subtillis [44] in
which each of the seven or ten rRNA operons, respectively,
were inactivated, and the strains expressed only one rRNA
operon encoded on a plasmid. Although both studies still
reported that ksgA mutations are the main mechanism of
resistance to KSM, mutations in the drug-binding site at
position A794 and G926 of the 16S rRNA conferred four to
eight times more resistance to KSM than KsgA inactivation
or alteration of the adenosine targeted by the methylase at

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/279

position 1519 of the 16S rRNA. In this study, all KSMR
mutations selected in C. psittaci 6BC mapped to the drugbinding site at position A794G. Our inability to isolate
KSMR plaques for C. psittaci 6BC with mutations in the
16S rRNA gene at position 926 or 1519 suggests that
either they do not confer KSM resistance levels high
enough to be selected in the plaque assay or they impose
a significant burden on bacterial fitness. Such species-specific bias for drug resistance mutations has been reported
for other ribosome-targeting antibiotics including tetracycline, linezolid and macrolides [48].
5-KsgA is critical for optimal growth of Chlamydia
Serial passages in sub-inhibitory concentrations of KSM
allowed the purification of a C. trachomatis variant synthesizing a shortened rRNA adenine dimethyltransferase
enzyme in which the eight structural and catalytic methyltransferase motifs were maintained, but harboring 20
unrelated amino acids because of the frameshift at codon
203 (Figure 2). Overexpression of the truncated chlamydial protein in ATM809, the E. coli ksgA mutant, was
strongly inhibitory for cell growth, as observed earlier
with the wild-type KsgAL2 protein. On the other hand
expression from a copy of ksgAE9, the frameshift mutant,
integrated in the bacterial chromosome, i.e. in ATM815,
had no consequence on bacterial growth in the absence or
in the presence of KSM (Figure 3), with a MIC of 2000
μg.ml-1 (Table 1). This shows that the chlamydial KsgA Cterminal tail is essential for activity in this heterologous
system. Crystal structure analyses revealed that the N-terminal and the C-terminal portions of E. coli and Thermus
thermophilus KsgA orthologs form two domains and the
presence of several positively charged residues in the Cterminal domain predicted its involvement in binding to
rRNA [31,49]. Recent evidence has shown that both
domains interact with 16S rRNA in 30S ribosomal subunits [42]. More specifically the C-terminal domain of KsgA
competes with the C-terminal domain of initiation factor
IF3 for binding with the central domain of 16S rRNA.
Accordingly, KsgA would prevent ribosomes that are
undergoing methylation from entering the translational
cycle [42]. As a result one might expect immature ribosomes to enter translation in cells that lack KsgA thus bearing a physiological cost.

Screening for KSM resistance in C. trachomatis allowed us
to select for ksgA mutations in these as yet genetically
intractable pathogens [13]. Interestingly, plaques formed
by the C. trachomatis L2 ksgAE9 variant in the absence of
antibiotic were smaller than the wild-type strain (p <
0.0001 by t-test) with sizes of 0.27 mm ± 0.11 and 0.45
mm ± 0.13, respectively. This result shows that alteration
in KsgA affects the fitness of C. trachomatis in vitro, similarly to Mycobacterium tuberculosis [50]. It is worth noting
that although inactivation of ksgA has a minimal effect on

Page 8 of 12
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:279

growth of E. coli or B. subtilis at 37°C, recent studies have
shown that the mutants are outcompeted by the wild-type
strains at 37°C [44]. Similarly, while growth of a Y. pseudotuberculosis ksgA mutant is not severely affected under
normal laboratory conditions, the mutant strain is attenuated in the mouse model indicating that dimethylation
is essential for optimal fitness of the pathogen in vivo [51].
Although, the lack of a small animal model for C. trachomatis L2 precludes us from testing the consequences of
KsgA inactivation on the pathogenicity of the strain, it is
tempting to assume that the impairment of C. trachomatis
L2 growth in vitro seen for our ksgA mutant would be
reflected by an attenuation in virulence in vivo.

Conclusions
When high throughput screening of compounds predicted to bind to Bacillus subtillis RNA methyltransferase
ErmC identified new compounds that were inhibitory to
the growth of C. pneumoniae in vitro, Alvesalo et al. proposed that these small compounds were targeting the bacterial KsgA homolog [52]. Considering that ribosome
biogenesis factors are emerging as potential therapeutic
targets to combat pathogens [32], the present work provides evidence that Chlamydia possess a functional rRNA
dimethylase enzyme that is important for optimal growth
of these obligate intracellular organisms. The demonstration of two methyltransferases in Chlamydia ([53] and this
study) raises the question of how these obligate intracellular bacteria obtain S-adenosyl-methionine to carry out
these modifications. Our laboratory is currently investigating this aspect of Chlamydia biology.

Methods
Bacterial strains and antibiotics
The bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table
1. Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for cloning purposes. E. coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB)
broth with aeration or on LB agar. Ampicillin (Sigma) was
used at 100 μg ml-1 to maintain plasmids in E. coli and at
25 μg ml-1 to select for the ATM809 derivatives harboring
a single copy of the pGEMT-insert integrated in the chromosome (Table 1). KSM (Biomol) was used at the concentrations indicated.
Propagation of Chlamydia and tissue culture cells
C. trachomatis serovar L2/LGV/434/Bu and C. psittaci serovar 6BC were grown in mouse fibroblast L2 cells as previously described [11].
Nucleic acid manipulation and sequence data analysis
Total genomic DNA was prepared from C. trachomatis L2
or C. psittaci 6BC infected cells with DNeasy Tissue Kits
(Qiagen). To identify the ksgA genomic region in C. psittaci 6BC, a 5.6 kb product was amplified by PCR using
degenerate primers designed from highly conserved genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/279

surrounding the ksgA chromosomal region in the Chlamydiaceae (i.e. UpK-F1 [5'-CGACCACTCTGCCACTCTTCC3']
and
DWK-R1
[5'-CCYGTRATYTTWGCKATAGATCGTCGAGG-3']). The PCR product was cloned into
pGEMT (Promega) and sequenced by the Biomedical
Instrumentation Center at USUHS. Nucleotide sequences
and predicted protein sequences were analyzed and
aligned using Clone Manager 8 (Scientific & Educational
Software, Durham, NC), focusing mainly on ksgA and its
upstream gene, i.e. CT354 and CT355 respectively (C. trachomatis serovar D designation, GenBank accession
number NC000117). Protein homolog searches used the
bioinformatic tools provided by the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and by the Berkeley
Phylogenomics
group
http://phylogenomics.berke
ley.edu/tools.php.
KsgA phylogenetic analysis was performed on the Phylogeny.fr platform [17] and comprised the following steps.
Sequences were aligned with MUSCLE (v3.7) configured
for highest accuracy (MUSCLE with default settings). After
alignment, ambiguous regions (i.e. containing gaps and/
or poorly aligned) were removed with Gblocks (v0.91b)
using the following parameters: -minimum length of a
block after gap cleaning: 10; -no gap positions were
allowed in the final alignment; -all segments with contiguous non conserved positions bigger than 8 were rejected;
-minimum number of sequences for a flank position:
85%. The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the
maximum likelihood method implemented in the PhyML
program (v3.0 aLRT). The WAG substitution model was
selected assuming an estimated proportion of invariant
sites (of 0.055) and 4 gamma-distributed rate categories
to account for rate heterogeneity across sites. The gamma
shape parameter was estimated directly from the data
(gamma=1.612). Reliability for internal branch was
assessed using the aLRT test (SH-Like). Graphical representation and edition of the phylogenetic tree were performed with TreeDyn (v198.3).
Construction of the E. coli K12 ΔksgA mutant, ATM809
An E. coli ksgA-mutant was generated first in strain
BW25113 (Table 1) using the λ Red recombinase method
described by Datensko and Wanner [29]. The pKD4 template plasmid (chloramphenicol resistance) was used
with
the
primers
KD5
[5'CACCCAATGAATAATCGAGTCCACCAGGGCCACTTAG
CCCGTAAACGCtgtgtaggctggagctgcttc-3'] and KD6 [5'CGAATTGATCATCGTTAACTCTCCTGCAAAGGCGCGTT
CTCCGCCAcatatgaatatcctccttagttcc-3']. The PCR product
that contains 46 bp of DNA homologous to the E. coli
chromosomal regions flanking ksgA, shown underlined in
the above primers, was used to electroporate BW25113
containing the λ Red recombinase expression plasmid
pKD46. Expression of the λ Red system allowed for

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:279

recombination of the PCR product into the bacterial chromosome and replacement of the chromosomal ksgA copy
by the chloramphenicol resistance gene. This mutation
was confirmed using PCR analysis of genomic DNA using
the primers ksgA-F3 [5'-ACCCAATGAATAATCGAGTCCACC-3'] and ksgA-R2 [5'-TGATCATCGTTAACTCTCCTGCAAAG-3']. Next, a P1L4 lysate was grown on the
ΔksgA::cat strain and used to transduce MC4100 to chloramphenicol resistance, creating ATM809 (Table 1). Deletion of ksgA in ATM809 was confirmed by PCR analysis
(see above) and resulted in increased resistance to KSM
(Table 1).
Cloning of ksgA in plasmid pGEMT
Complementation plasmids were constructed by cloning
PCR products generated from E. coli or chlamydial DNA
lysates into pGEMT (Promega), under the control of the
lactose promoter. Sequencing of all cloned genes was performed by the Biomedical Instrumentation Center at
USUHS. E. coli K12 ksgA gene was amplified using primers
ksgA-F3 and ksgA-R2, creating pRAK297. C. trachomatis L2
ksgA gene was amplified using primers DWK-R2 [5'-ACTCAAGATCTCTAATCATAATCCCA-3'] and ksgA-F [5'AGGGTGGCACGGAGTTCTATAGAAC-3'] containing the
genuine GUG start codon or ksgAF5 [5'-GGATGGCACGGAGTTCTATAGAAC-3'] where the GUG start codon has
been replaced by the conventional AUG start codon, creating pRAK317 and pRAK316, respectively. pRAK363 was
constructed similarly to pRAK316 except that the PCR
product was amplified from C. trachomatis L2 ksgAE9
genomic DNA (Table 1). C. psittaci 6BC ksgA homolog was
amplified using primers ksgA-F8 [5'-CGCTATGGCTTTGACTCATCG-3'] and ksgA-R6 [5'-CACTTAGGCGTGCAATGAGAG-3'] and cloned in pGEMT under the
control of the lactose promoter, creating pRAK325. In this
construct the putative KsgA6BC UUG start codon was ~ 60
bp downstream of the Ribosome Binding Site, and was
consequently expected to be expressed at a low level in E.
coli due to polar effect. Accordingly, unlike E. coli transformants harboring pRAK316, pRAK317 or pRAK363, we
did not observe any growth defect in E. coli pRAK325
transformants after addition of IPTG (see below).
Insertion of the ksgA-pGEMT inserts into ATM809
chromosome
We predicted that expressing KsgAL2 at a physiological
level will reduce the growth inhibition observed in E. coli
when the gene was carried on high copy vectors. Therefore
inserts from plasmids pRAK297, pRAK316, pRAK317 and
pRAK363 were inserted at the att site in the chromosome
of ATM809 using the λlnCh tool as described by Boyd et
al. [54]. Briefly, homology between the ksgA-pGEMT constructs (near-ori region and part of the bla gene) and
sequences on the InCh bacteriophage allowed some
phages to acquire both the ampicillin resistance gene (i.e.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/279

bla) and the vector ksgA insert by recombination. After
subsequent infection of ATM809, the recombinant phage
bla - ksgA region was transferred into the bacterial att site
by site-specific recombination, creating lysogens. Finally
recombination between the bacterial genome near att and
the phage DNA that carry the same region resulted in deletion of the phage while leaving bla-ksgA in the bacterial
genome, creating bacterial stable recombinants. Insertion
sites were confirmed by PCR [54]. Primers Puc-F and PucR [10] showed the presence of the ksgA insert in ATM810,
ATM811, ATM812 and ATM815 (Table 1). Primers GalF
[5'-CTTGCTGAGTACGTGAGTTC-3'] and IG-R [5'ACGTTGGAGTCCACGTTCTT-3'] amplified a 1248 bp
product in ATM810, ATM811 and ATM815 only, showing
that these three strains were stable recombinants. On the
other hand, we were unable to obtain "stable" recombinants from ATM812, as seen by PCR amplification of a
977 bp product using primers GalF and Att-R [5'-AAGCAGGCTTCAACGGATTC-3'], similarily to MC4100 and
ATM809. Maintenance of the ksgA insert in ATM812 chromosome was followed throughout the study by PCR with
Puc-F and Puc-R and by the constant presence of ampicillin for selection.
Analysis of bacterial growth
The effect of KsgA on bacterial growth was first studied in
E. coli recombinants. Cells were grown at 37°C overnight
in LB without salt [55] supplemented with ampicillin. Saturated cultures were diluted 1/100 in fresh expression
medium (i.e. LB without salt supplemented with 1 mM
IPTG) and incubated at 37°C for 2 to 3 hours, then normalized to an OD600 nm equivalent of 0.5. Bacteria were
serially diluted in sterile buffered saline gelatin [150 mM
NaCl, 2 mM KH2PO4, 4 mM Na2HPO4, 0.01% gelatin].
For each dilution, aliquots of 2 μl were spotted onto two
expression medium agar plates. One plate was left at 20°C
for about 30 hrs and the second plate was incubated at
30°C for 12 hrs (Figure 4). 100 μl of a 10-5 dilution was
plated on expression medium agar plates and incubated at
37°C for 12 hrs. The sizes of 15 random colonies were
determined for each strain and averaged.

The effect of KsgA on C. trachomatis growth was determined by measuring and averaging the size of a minimum
of 60 plaques formed by the two C. trachomatis L2 variants
in the absence of selection, two weeks after simultaneous
inoculation onto three 60-mm confluent monolayers of
mouse fibroblast cells each.
KSM sensitivity assays
MIC was determined for E. coli in test tubes inoculated
with about 105 bacteria collected from exponential phase
cultures grown at 37°C in expression medium containing
various concentrations of KSM. MIC was defined as the
lowest concentration at which no growth was visible after

Page 10 of 12

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:279

16 hrs incubation at 37°C (Table 1). Subsequently, cultures were also incubated in triplicate with agitation for 24
hrs in the presence of 50, 250, 500, 750 and 1000 μg ml-1
of KSM in expression medium. Growth was determined
spectrophotometrically at 600 nm and normalized to the
value obtained for ATM809 at the same concentration of
KSM. KSM inhibition growth curves (Figure 3) were generated using the Prism 3.0 software (GraphPad Software,
Inc, San Diego, CA).
Susceptibility of C. trachomatis and C. psittaci to KSM was
examined in the plaque assay. MIC was defined as the
drug concentration that inhibits the development of 105
chlamydial plaque-forming units (PFU) in a confluent L2
monolayer in a 60 mm dish [11]. To test for spontaneous
drug resistance, 60 mm dishes were infected with 107 to
108 PFU (MOI 1 to 10) and the drug was added two hrs
p.i. at a concentration high enough to inhibit the cytotoxicity associated with this inoculum size. The frequency of
spontaneous mutation to drug resistance was determined
by dividing the number of PFU on selective medium by
the number of PFU added to the monolayer (as measured
by titration of PFU in the absence of antibiotic) [11].
Three clonal C. trachomatis KSMr isolates, including L2
ksgAE9 (Table 1) were independently purified in the
plaque assay in the presence of 300 μg/ml of KSM, following 7 to 13 successive passages in mouse cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of antibiotic (from 100
to 800 μg ml-1).

PCR and DNA sequencing of the KSM resistance targets in
Chlamydia
PCR amplification and DNA sequencing were used to
determine whether chlamydial resistance to KSM was due
to a mutation in the 16S rRNA gene as described in [13]
or in ksgA using the primers described above. Because ksgA
is apparently the second gene of a bicistronic operon in C.
trachomatis and C. psittaci, we also sequenced about 2 kb
upsteam of ksgA. DNA sequences for each antibiotic resistant isolate were aligned using Clone Manager 8 and compared to the respective DNA sequence obtained from the
wild-type parental strain. We also amplified C. trachomatis
L2 rpsI region using primers rpsI-F1 [5'-GCTGAGAAAGTGCGTTTGACTG-3'] and rpsI-R1 [5'-GAAAGCAAGCACGGGACAAATC-3'] and sequenced the PCR fragment using
primer rpsI-F2 [5'-ACATGATTGCGCGAAAGC-3']. No
mutation was seen in the three KSM resistant isolates.
