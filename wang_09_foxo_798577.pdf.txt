Abstract
Background: Forkhead box, class O (FoxO) belongs to the large family of forkhead transcription
factors that are characterized by a conserved forkhead box DNA-binding domain. To date, the
FoxO group has four mammalian members: FoxO1, FoxO3a, FoxO4 and FoxO6, which are
orthologs of DAF16, an insulin-responsive transcription factor involved in regulating longevity of
worms and flies. The degree of homology between these four members is high, especially in the
forkhead domain, which contains the DNA-binding interface. Yet, mouse FoxO knockouts have
revealed that each FoxO gene has its unique role in the physiological process. Whether the
functional divergences are primarily due to adaptive selection pressure or relaxed selective
constraint remains an open question. As such, this study aims to address the evolutionary mode of
FoxO, which may lead to the functional divergence.
Results: Sequence similarity searches have performed in genome and scaffold data to identify
homologues of FoxO in vertebrates. Phylogenetic analysis was used to characterize the family
evolutionary history by identifying two duplications early in vertebrate evolution. To determine the
mode of evolution in vertebrates, we performed a rigorous statistical analysis with FoxO gene
sequences, including relative rate ratio tests, branch-specific dN/dS ratio tests, site-specific dN/dS
ratio tests, branch-site dN/dS ratio tests and clade level amino acid conservation/variation patterns
analysis. Our results suggest that FoxO is constrained by strong purifying selection except four sites
in FoxO6, which have undergone positive Darwinian selection. The functional divergence in this
family is best explained by either relaxed purifying selection or positive selection.
Conclusion: We present a phylogeny describing the evolutionary history of the FoxO gene family
and show that the genes have evolved through duplications followed by purifying selection except
for four sites in FoxO6 fixed by positive selection lie mostly within the non-conserved optimal PKB
motif in the C-terminal part. Relaxed selection may play important roles in the process of functional
differentiation evolved through gene duplications as well.

Background
Mammalian FoxO proteins (FoxO1, FoxO3a, FoxO4 and
FoxO6) which are homologous to Caenorhabditis elegans
protein DAF-16, belong to the O ('other') class of the Fox
superfamily [1,2]. FOXO1 is the first identified member of
the FoxO family of transcription factors [3] and is
involved in the transcriptional activity of alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas [3]. Since then, the discovery of mammalian FoxO genes has grown rapidly, now FoxO proteins
have been identified in several different organisms,
including zebrafish, mouse, rat and human. As transcription factors in the nucleus, the primary function of FoxO
proteins is to bind to their cognate DNA targeting
sequences as monomers. The co-crystal structure of HNF3γ with DNA shows that there are 14 protein-DNA contacts distributing throughout the forkhead domain, but
the third α-helix (H3) plays the most important role in a
winged helix/forkhead protein's DNA-binding specificity
[4]. In addition, both winged loops also make important
interactions with DNA [4,5]. Although the molecular
basis of the DNA-binding specificity of FoxO transcription
factors is poorly understood, high-affinity DNA-binding
studies have identified a consensus FoxO-recognized element (FRE) as (G/C) (T/A)AA(C/T)AA [6-8]. Indeed, functional FRE sites that match this consensus sequence have
been identified in the promoters of many genes, such as
Fas ligand (FasL), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) and the apoptotic regulator BIM[9,10].
Additional putative FoxO-target genes and their potential
cis-regulatory binding sites have been predicted by systematic bioinformatic approaches [11]. Thus, FoxO transcription factors appear to be involved in various
signaling pathways and control a wide range of biochemical processes including cellular differentiation, tumor
suppression, metabolism, cell-cycle arrest, cell death, and
protection from stress [1,9,10]. In the mouse, four different FoxO members have been identified to date: Foxo1,
Foxo3, Foxo4 and Foxo6 [12,13]. FoxO6 is the latest
member of the FoxO family to be cloned and shares significant sequence similarity with the other members of
the family [13].
FoxO1 and its close paralogus (FoxO3, FoxO4 and
FoxO6) are thought to some degree of functional diversification during development [14-16] and their potential
physiological roles might be different [14]. Indeed, a
rapid overview of the data collected on FoxO1, 3, 4 and 6
highlights how these proteins may be different. First, each
FoxO gene showed different expression patterns in tissues
[7,12,17-19]. While Foxo1 was strongly expressed in the
striatum and neuronal subsets of the hippocampus (dentate gyrus and the ventral/posterior part of the CA
regions), Foxo3 was more diffusely expressed throughout
the brain including all hippocampal areas, cortex and cerebellum, and Foxo6 expression was eminent in various

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/222

parts of the adult mouse brain. Moreover, the individual
disruption of Foxo1, Foxo3 and Foxo4 genes in mice
results in different phenotypes [14,16]. While a
homozygous knockout of Foxo1 (FKHR) was embryonic
lethal due to failures in angiogenesis and vessel formation, Foxo3a-/- (FKHRL1) and Foxo4-/- (AFX) were viable
and appeared to develop normally. Later in development,
Foxo3a-/- females were found to be age-dependently
infertile and showed abnormal ovarian follicular development. As to the physiological role, each FoxO gene exhibits a distinct response under a variety of conditions [2022]. Therefore, despite the high sequence identity shared
by FoxO genes domain (more then 60% in humans [17]),
the physiological roles of FoxO genes are functionally
diverse in mammals.
Single copy genes are thought to evolve conservatively
because of strong negative selective pressure. Gene duplications produce a redundant gene copy and thus release
one or both copies from negative selection pressure [23].
There are a number of models for the fate of duplicate
gene that predict functional differentiation of paralogs
based on protein sequence or regulatory divergence
[24,25]. Currently four most prominent models are neofunctionalization [26], subfunctionalization [24], the
Dykhuizen-Hartl effect [27] and adaptive diversification.
Very recently, the list has been expanded by the introduction of the subneofunctionalization [28] and the adaptive
radiation [29] models that predict rapid subfunctionalization after duplication followed by a prolonged period of
neofunctionalization and adaptive divergence of duplicate genes in a process analogous to species radiations,
respectively. Thus, duplications are thought to be an
important precursor of functional divergence [30]. Here,
we are interested in the specific role that natural selection
might play in the evolutionary history of this gene duplication.
The increased availability of FoxO sequences in the public
databases allows us to explore the functional diversity
from a phylogenetic perspective within the FoxO family in
vertebrates. The study was conducted by analyzing amino
acid and nucleotide-based divergence data from different
species covering the entire vertebrates. Our aim was to elucidate the evolutionary mechanisms operating in the
retention of these genes and evaluate the changes in selection pressures following duplication. We also identified
the sites under positive Darwinian selection. Finally, we
tried to map the positively selected sites to the structural
and functional regions of FoxO molecules.

Materials and methods
Sequence Data Collection
The DNA sequences and amino acids sequences of
FoxO genes were downloaded from NCBI's GenBank

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:222

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. PSI-BLAST searches were
conducted against the non-redundant database of vertebrate genomes at NCBI (e-value cutoff = 1e-24) using the
amino acid sequences of Foxo1, Foxo3, Foxo4 and Foxo6
of mouse (gi: 56458, gi: 56484, gi: 54601 and gi: 329934)
as queries. Only full length coding sequences were
included in our analysis. Jalview 2.3 [31] was used to
remove the sequences with the identity higher than 95%.
A table with species names, abbreviations and accession
numbers are provided in supplementary materials (Additional file 1).
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
The sequences of FoxO proteins were aligned by MUSCLE
[32] and the resulting alignment was manually optimized
by BioEdit [33]. Incomplete sequences, and highly divergent regions or gaps resulting in uncertain alignments
were excluded from the further analysis. The final data set
included a total of 66 sequences from 19 species. The
amino acid alignment was subsequently transformed into
an aligned cds fasta file using PAL2NAL [34] which is a
program to construct multiple codon alignments from
matching amino acid sequences. The nucleotide alignment was then converted to nexus format with DnaSP
[35] version 4.10 for phylogenetic analysis.

The full alignment of 66 sequences was used to perform
the phylogenetic analysis. Tree reconstructions were done
by the Bayesian method from the DNA alignment done in
the MrBayes version 3.1.2 [36,37] software package, and
rooted with the BfFoxO, Cifoxo and SpFoxO from amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae), Ciona intestinalis and
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. We analyzed four independent runs, each using the general time reversible
(GTR) model plus gamma distribution plus invariant sites
model of molecular evolution (GTR+G+I), as determined
by Modeltest version 3.7 [38]. We ran 2 million generation Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations with four
separate chains (three heated, one cold), with the first
500,000 generations discarded as burn-in. Trees were
summarized for each independent run and compared to
check for concordant topologies. The consensus tree of all
compatible groupings among all runs was used in all analyses.
Synonymous codon usage analyses
Codon usage bias was estimated by the effective number
of codons (ENC; [39]), the frequency of optimal codons
(FOP; [40]) and proportion of G and C in the third codon
position (G/C 3rd). For ENC, lower values indicate
stronger synonymous codon usage bias, while for FOP
higher values indicate stronger bias. These measures were
calculated for all genes using the CodonW program http:/
/bioweb.pasteur.fr/seqanal/interfaces/codonw.html and
used to test whether the degree of synonymous codon
usage biases in individual genes.

Relative rate tests
The substitution rates of the FoxO genes were compared
between different paralogous genes that had undergone
duplication events recently, using the RRTree software
[41]. The orthologs FoxOs (Cifoxo, BfFoxOA and
SpFoxOl) from amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae),
Ciona intestinalis and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus
were used as an outgroup. The null hypothesis is that the
rate of substitution of the tested clade is the same as that
of the reference group.
Estimation of substitution rates and testing natural
selection
We estimated the selective pressures acting on coding
regions by applying a phylogenetic-based Maximum Likelihood (ML) analysis. ML estimated of the relevant parameters -as branch lengths and the ratio of the
nonsynonymous (dN) to synonymous substitution rates
(dS), ω = dN/dS-that were obtained using the codeml program implemented in the PAML package version 4 [42].
The ω parameter was used as a measure of the protein
selective constraints [43]. These analyses were conducted
under different competing evolutionary hypothesis. We
first investigated whether the distribution of selective constraints acting on the each gene fluctuated across lineages;
for that, we compared the fit to the data of the "one ratio"
model (M0), which assumes a constant selective pressure
across branches, with the "free ratios" model (FR), where
the rate parameters were estimated independently in each
lineage. We also examined other evolutionary scenarios; i)
to determine which FoxO lineage had evolved at a different rate, as compared to the rest of the phylogeny, we
applied a branch-specific model to the data. Sequences
were divided into four groups according to their phylogenetic analysis, and each FoxO lineage was set as the foreground branch. ii) to detect sites under positive selection
in four lineages, we applied three codon-based ML substitution models that are site-specific (i.e., models that allow
variation in the ω ratio across sites) of [44] but assume the
same selection pattern for a site in all lineages; iii) to
investigate the existence of sites evolving under positive
selection in only a specific lineage, we applied the modified branch-site model A of [45] in two consecutive tests
(test1 and test2 in [46]) to the same alignment used for
the site-based models. The model allowing for positive
selection is denoted model A and the lineage to be tested
is the foreground lineage, whereas the remaining ones are
the background lineages; the multiple hypothesis testing
problem [47] was taking into account using Bonferroni's
correction [48]. The likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) was used
to compare the fit to the data of two nested models,
assuming that twice the log likelihood difference between
the two models (2ΔL) follows a χ2 distribution with a
number of degrees of freedom equal to the difference in
the number of free parameters [49].

We used the TreeSAAP version 3.2 [50] to determine the
FoxO physicochemical properties affected by natural
selection. This program for examining the effects of nonsynonymous substitutions on protein evolution compares
the observed distribution of physicochemical changes
inferred from a phylogenetic tree with an expected distribution based on the assumption of completely random
amino acid replacement expected under the condition of
selective neutrality. For all possible pairwise amino acid
changes, the range of effect size for each of the 31 properties was determined and equally divided into 8 magnitude
categories. Categories 1 to 3 indicate small variation in the
amino acid characteristics while categories 6 to 8 represent the most radical substitutions. For all properties that
differed significantly from neutrality, Z-scores were then
calculated in each magnitude category to determine which
classes contributed to this deviation. The critical Z-score
values for P = 0.001 are 3.09, indicating positive selection
on that magnitude category, and -3.09, which indicates
negative (purifying) selection. That is, positive and negative Z-scores indicate positive and purifying selection,
respectively. Radical substitutions affecting a particular
property that occurred more frequently than expected by
chance constituted the signature of adaptive evolution
[51].
Testing functional divergence and structure analysis
To study the functional divergence and structural differences after the gene duplication, we used the Diverge 2.0
software to estimate the type I (θI) and type II (θII) functional divergence coefficients [52,53] among paralogous
proteins. Type I and type II refer to shifts in the evolutionary rate pattern after the emergence of a new phylogenetic
cluster (indicative of changes in functional constrains),
and amino acid replacements completely fixed between
duplicates (resulting in cluster-specific alterations of
amino acid physiochemical properties), respectively.

Genes which have been predicted to subject to positive
selection were used to search for homologous sequences
in the PDB database of protein structures http://
www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do using Blastp [54,55].
The Rasmol http://rasmol.org/ was used for all structural
manipulations and highlighting the relevant amino acid
replacements identified in the evolutionary analyses..

Phylogenetic analyses of FoxO gene lineages
To study the molecular evolution of vertebrate FoxO
genes, we carried out phylogenetic inference analyses
based on codon alignment and inferred their evolutionary
history using Bayesian methods. We used the Bayesian
posterior probabilities (PPs) of each node to evaluate
clades support. Figure 1 shows the consensus phylogeny
obtained for FoxO gene sequences. The vertebrate FoxOs
were assorted well to four lineages according to their FoxO
classification, all with high PP support values (a poorly
supported position: 0.99 PP) indicating that the formation of the paralogous lineages occurred before the divergence of individual species, and the orthologs FoxOs
(Cifoxo, BfFoxOA and SpFoxOl) from amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae), Ciona intestinalis and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus were just located as an outgroup of their
assigned lineages. From Figure 1, we inferred that two
major duplications had occurred early in the vertebrate
lineages. The first duplication led to the emergence of two
lineages which evolved into FoxO3/6 and FoxO1/4, and
the second duplication, also early in vertebrate evolution,
resulted in FoxO6 and FoxO3, and FoxO1 and FoxO4.
Phylogenetic tree shows that the FoxO6 gene cluster has
long branches, an indication of fast-evolving lineage with
a large number of structural changes accumulating on
them.
Synonymous codon usage analyses
We investigated the relationship between nucleotide content and codon usage by calculating different indices
(Table 1) for each of the FoxO genes. We could see from
Table 1 that the effective number of codons (ENC)
decreased with the corresponding increase of GC3. The
effective number of codons [39] is a measure of the evenness of codon usage among the 61 sense codons. An
extreme case is that all codons are used equally frequently
(given the observed frequencies of amino acids), then the
effective number of codons is 61. Reversely, only single
codon is used for each amino acid, the effective number
of codons is reduced to 20. Therefore, FoxO6 gene was
more biased than other FoxO genes as evidenced by their
lower ENC values. In most cases, the observed number fell
somewhere between the two extremes. Figure 2 shows the
relationship between the effective number of codons
(ENC) and the GC content at the third position of each
gene (GC3). This Figure also contains a reference line
(GCref) showing the expected position of genes whose
codon usage is constrained solely by the nucleotide composition at the third codon position. From Figure 2, it can

be seen that the observed value of ENC tracks the reference line quite closely. This indicates that the nucleotide
composition at the third codon position is a major determinant of the effective number of codons.
Relative rates of evolution of FoxO6 lineage
Using the orthologs FoxOs (Cifoxo, BfFoxOA and
SpFoxOl) from amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae),
Ciona intestinalis and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus as

an outgroup, we evaluated the relative rates between FoxO
gene clusters. The analysis (Table 2) revealed that the
FoxO6 lineage exhibited accelerated nonsynonymous
substitutions with respect to FoxO3 (p-value = 0.00163,
Bonferroni correction) and FoxO1 (p-value = 0.0193,
Bonferroni correction), and that FoxO4 genes were not
accelerated with respect to the other FoxO lineages. Therefore, evolutionary-rate changes may have occurred following FoxO gene duplications in the evolutionary process.

Selective constraints and functional divergence
Gene duplication-specific changes in the substitution
rates (type I functional divergence) might reflect the difference in evolutionary rate at amino acid sites after gene
duplication [52,53]. We found significant evidence of
type I functional divergence for comparisons between different gene clusters (θI = 0.23 ~0.40, P < 0.01; Table 3);
namely, there were some amino acid sites with discrepancies in their evolutionary rate between these paralogous

pairs. As expected, most amino acids had very low posterior probability (PP) values and, therefore, they would not
be involved in the hypothetical functional divergence
(Figure 3). Specifically, we detected 32 and 15 amino acid
positions which presumably submitted to altered functional constraints when the PP threshold values were set
to 0.87 and 0.95, respectively. Type I sites are defined as
those with an amino acid that is conserved in one cluster
but variable in the sister cluster, implying that the site is

Note: Ka corresponds to the mean evolutionary rate measured as the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per site. dKa is the mean rate
difference between the two lineages. sd_dKa is the standard deviation and ratio_Ka the ratio between dKa and sd_dKa. The P_Ka column
corresponds to the P value associated to the test

under structural/functional constraints in the first cluster
that is absent in the variable cluster [56].
Recently, a method has been developed to test for type II
functional divergence [57]. Type II sites are those that are
highly conserved in both clusters but are fixed for amino
acids with different biochemical properties between sister
clusters, implying these residues are responsible for the
functional differences between these groups. Although at
least one site with evidence of type II divergence was
found for comparisons between FoxO1/FoxO3, FoxO3/
FoxO4, and FoxO1/FoxO4 clusters, the θII values are
extremely small (θII = 0.005 ~0.074) that highlighted the
conservation between different clusters. These results are
not unexpected given that this method calculates θ across
all sites in an alignment and thus effectively averages sitewise θ values. With only ~3% of sites/cluster showing a
pattern of type II divergence in our concatenated alignment, it is not likely that the ~9 possible type II sites have
θII values high enough to compensate for the extremely
low θII values of the over 300 sites with θII effectively equal
to zero. Our results are similar to the analysis of Hox-gene
[30].
The analysis of the nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate ratio can also be used to detect functional
differentiation. We estimated ω as an average over all sites
and branches from the FoxO paralogus MSA and the ratio

was substantially smaller than 1 (one ratio model ω =
0.084, Table 4) that indicated that purifying selection had
been the predominant force acting on the evolution of
these vertebrate FoxOs. Omega estimates for FoxO1,
FoxO3, FoxO4 and FoxO6 phylogenies were 0.09583,
0.08311, 0.14088 and 0.13464, respectively. Selective
constrains, however, are unevenly distributed across the
phylogeny (FR model; 2ΔL = 421.20, P < 0.001). We then
ran the branch model using each FoxO lineage as the foreground branch. In this model the estimated ω1 was 0.0758
for the FoxO1, and 0.0898 for the background branches.
A LR test indicated that the two-ratio model was not significantly different from the M0 model (2ΔL = 3.05, P >
0.05, df = 1, Table 4). In contrast to FoxO1 analysis, the ω
values of the FoxO3, FoxO4 and FoxO6 lineages were different from the rest of the phylogeny as the LR tests indicated that the two-ratio model fit the data better than the
M0 model for these three genes (P < 0.05). Unfortunately,
the ω estimates for FoxO3, FoxO4 and FoxO6 were not
indicative of positive selection, they were rather indicative
of relaxed constraint.
Along with lineage heterogeneity, variations in ω across
sites can also occur. Theoretically, different protein
regions with different functions may experience different
selection pressures, which can be tested by fitting the data
to a model comprising different site classes. The results
were shown in Table 5, for each lineage, the M3 vs M0 LRT
was significant, indicating that one category of ω wasn't fit
data well to describe the variability in selection pressure
across amino acid sites. The tests contrasting the models
M1a against M2a resulted in the P value of 1 for all the
groups suggesting a lack of power and the amino acid
changes within each cluster were neutral or under negative
selection. M1a, the parameter estimates for the least
parameter rich model describes that most sites with low ω
estimates (indicative of strong selective constraints), that
is, 82% of FoxO1 sites were under strong purifying selection, compared to 83% for FoxO3, 74% for FoxO4 and
66% for FoxO6. The test using M7 and M8, which allows
for beta-distributed site-specific ω ratio, detected 2 groups
under possible positive selection at 0.05 significance level,

one with ω = 1.36 and the other with ω = 127.02 (Table
5). In order to test whether the estimated ω is significantly
greater than 1, model M8 was compared with a more
restricted null model (M8a). For FoxO3 gene, Model M8
did not significantly differ from model M8a (2ΔL = 0.067,
P > 0.05, df = 1). For FoxO6 gene, ω = 127.02 was significantly different than 1 (2ΔL = 51.92, P < 0.01, df = 1). We
also used the BEB estimation method in model M8 [46] to
identify sites under possible positive selection.
Since positive selection will likely affect a few amino acids
at specific lineages on the phylogeny, models estimating ω
ratios averaged by codons or by lineages are certainly
highly conservative. For this reason, a branch-sites

method has been developed that allows variation in ω
across individual codons on a specific lineage [46,58].
This model (MA) designates two categories of branches,
again foreground and background, where positive selection is modeled only on the foreground branch. We then
applied the branch-site approach (using some pre-specified branches, i.e., foreground branches), designating
each FoxO gene as the foreground branch, to assess
whether molecular adaptation occurred in the evolution
of the FoxO genes. The results of this analysis exhibited
several positions with evidence of relaxed selection (the
test 1 was significant) (Table 6). However, we could not
reject the null hypothesis of the test 2 (ω2 = 1) (result not

expected by chance for 2 of the properties (alpha-helical
tendencies and compressibility).

The molecular adaptation processes occurred after the
gene duplication event were also investigated by comparing the magnitude of the physicochemical changes produced by the observed amino acid replacements with
those expected at random [59]. We used the program
Tree-SAAP [50] to model how 31 different physicochemical properties were affected by amino acid substitutions in
each FoxO gene. Consistent overrepresentation of radical
amino acid changes (i.e., categories 7 and 8) would suggest repeated adaptive substitution [51]. The results indicated that, some amino acid replacements altering these
physicochemical properties in the FoxO1 and FoxO3 proteins accumulated more (or less) often than expected by
chance (likely reflecting fitness differences) (supplementary materials (Additional file 1)). Moreover, for each
physicochemical property, the distribution of the Z-scores
across 8 magnitude classes [51] indicated that, amino acid
substitutions occurred less often than expected by chance
at the most extreme magnitude-classes (supplementary
Additional file 1); these FoxO1 and FoxO3 protein properties, therefore, were likely evolving under purifying
selection. For FoxO4 and FoxO6 genes, less physicochemical properties were affected by amino acid substitutions.
The FoxO6 gene, on the contrary, seems to evolve positive
selection, because category 8 occurs more frequently than

Spatial distributions of possible selected FoxO6 Sites on
three-dimensional structure
Because of the evidence for possible positive selection on
FoxO6, we predicted positively selected codon sites using
a Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) method [45]. The sites
under selection in FoxO6 are listed in Table 5. Four codon
sites were identified as positively selected at a BEB posterior probability threshold of 95%. Moreover, 7 amino
acid residues presumably submitted to altered functional
constraints were identified by both PAML 4 and Diverge
2.0 analysis (Table 6). In order to plot positive selected
sites onto mouse (Foxo6) three-dimensional model, we
first built an energy-minimized model using a homology
modeling approach [60]. The PDB entry with the highest
sequence similarity -identified in the PSI-BLAST- corresponds to the human FOXO3A (PDB: 2k86). We used this
entry as a template for the modelling. The in silico stereochemical quality analysis [61] indicated that the generated
model had a moderate quality (with the percentage of residues in most favored regions being no lower than the
82.8%), with only 1.1% in disallowed regions. As
expected, the modeled structure was roughly similar to the
template, with the three helices and two wing loops typical of the Fox family in equivalent positions and with a
similar predicted folding (Figure 4). Taken together, these

data suggested that the model was stereochemically valid,
and therefore suitable for further sequence-structural
analysis. Unfortunately, we could not map any positive
selected sites onto the surface of the 3D structure (Figure
4A) because the crystal structures about Fox proteins are
mainly focused on the forkhead DNA-binding domain.
Whereas the positive selected sites were mainly located in
the region of N-terminal and C-terminal of FoxO6, which
also indicated that FoxO6 underwent strong constraint on
the forkhead domain as well (Sequence logo of the forkhead domain, Figure 4).

Discussion
It has long been know that FoxO transcription factors play
important roles in regulating various signals, which translate various environmental stimuli into dynamic gene
expression programs to influence many physiological and
pathological processes, including cancer and aging. The
functions of FoxO proteins are regulated at multiple levels, which include but are not limited to phosphorylation,
ubiquitylation and acetylation. Interestingly, all of these
activities affect nuclear/cytoplasmic trafficking of FoxO
proteins. The specific function of each member of this
family is different [14]. As the accumulation of gene
sequences in the database, it is feasible to explore the
functional diversity from a phylogenetic perspective. We

performed firstly to the resolution of the evolutionary
relationships of these FoxOs using molecular sequence
data. Whereas, the incorrect phylogenetic topology resulting from mutationally saturated positions, inadequate
modeling of the evolutionary process and systematic bias
due to variable rates of evolution among species or within
sequences [62] may make LRT generate many false positives. Anisimova et al (2003) examined the effect of
assuming a "wrong" tree [63], and he found that LRT
falsely suggested positive selection in 96% of the replicates in the M0-M3 comparison and in 86% of the replicates in the M7-M8 comparison at the = 5% significance
level. In order to overcome this problem, we adopted a
number of ways in combination. Firstly, the addition of
more taxa to the dataset: denser sampling of species can
reduce the effect of long branch attraction (LBA) by reducing the overall distances between taxa. Secondly, we used
the best model of DNA substitution, determined by Modeltest version 3.7 [38]. And finally, our inclusion of
enough sequences in each lineage helped alleviate loss of
LRT power from short conserved sequences. From phylogenetic result, we focused on the 2 main duplications
along the evolutionary history of FoxO genes, the FoxO1FoxO4 and the FoxO3-FoxO6 duplication, which formed
four gene lineages (all with the high confidence values,

nearly 100% posterior probability in Bayesian analysis)
and used for further analysis.
Codon bias is largely thought to be due to weak selection
acting to optimize protein production [64-66]. Selection
intensity for codon usage bias, therefore, is expected to
vary among genes. Our survey of synonymous codon
usage in FoxO genes revealed a strong and consistent pattern of codon bias in genes with FoxO6 relative to those
with FoxO1, FoxO3 and FoxO4 (Table 1). At the same
time, there appears to be some conflicting results
observed between FOP and ENC, which may be caused by
differences in the way that the two methods estimate
codon bias. FOP is based on the frequency of a set of species specific "optimal" codons, while ENC is based on the
observed number of codons used for each amino acid.
Thus it is possible for the two methods to give different
estimates of codon bias.

It is widely accepted that gene duplication can create
opportunities for functional divergence in paralogues.
Divergence is thought to occur where one duplicate
retains the original protein function and the other accumulates changes, (either through redundancy or by positive selection) or alternatively, through the partitioning of
the functions of an unduplicated ancestor protein. Whatever the mechanism, if functional divergence has occurred
between duplicated genes, then it should be observable as
changes within their coding regions.
The functional divergence of FoxO genes has been studied
by [14]. The branch length leading to the FoxO6 clade is
extended relative to other FoxO genes in gene phylogeny,
(Figure 1). This suggested that after the duplications,
FoxO6 evolved at a faster rate than other FoxO genes. This
result was confirmed by significant relative rate test results
for FoxO gene lineages (Table 2). In this sense, we per-

formed type I functional divergence analysis, and we
detected significant type I divergence among FoxOs. The
comparison between the FoxO3 and FoxO6 groups
showed the highest value for θ (0.40 ± 0.05), suggesting
that these two groups had diverged considerably more at
the functional level. Next, DIVERGE was used to establish
the posterior probability of type I divergence at each site
in the alignment, employing two cut-off posterior probability values of 0.87 and 0.95. However, the cutoff value
for residue selection is an empirical decision and is
expected to depend on the intrinsic properties of the protein family being analyzed. Thus, we predicted 32 candidate functional divergence-related sites using 0.87 as a
cutoff value (supplementary materials (Additional file
1)). When we narrowed our criteria to 0.95, we got 15 candidate residues as the most likely candidate sites for type I
functional divergence (supplementary materials (Additional file 1)), but we lacked a way to verify how the rateshift in these sites contributed to functional divergence
among the FoxO gene groups. For comparative purposes,
the same alignment and phylogeny was submitted to a ML
LRT, which, like the Bayesian method provided a statistical framework where evolutionary rate shifts at particular
protein positions could be established [46]. At last, the
statistically most likely positions predicted to underlie
functional divergence were agreement by both methods,
particularly for the highest-ranking candidates (Table 6).
In this study we used codon substitution models implemented through a maximum likelihood framework to
estimate the rate of evolution at silent and replacement
sites in FoxO1 and its paralogs, FoxO3, FoxO4 and
FoxO6. Different models were used to investigate variation in the rate of evolution between lineages of a phylogeny, and to estimate ω for specific lineages and sites across
phylogenies. Our objective was to determine the mode of
evolution on each FoxO gene lineage, and to determine
whether increased positive selection or decreased constraint led to the functional divergence of FoxO genes. As
we have demonstrated, variation among branch and sites
was observed in the FoxO6 phylogeny. Moreover, physicochemical amino acid properties analysis also provided
evidence that the entire FoxO6 gene had experienced
repeated episodes of adaptive evolution. The site models
showed that adaptation had appeared at four sites located
at C-terminal of FoxO6. For FoxO3 gene, Model M8 fits
data significantly better than Model M7 (2ΔL = 8.23, df =
2, P < 0.05), and because 1.5% of sites are located in the
positively selected site class with ω = 1.36, weak positive
selection may be indicated with this comparison. However, it has been found that a poor fit of the data to a beta
distribution may result in a high frequency of significant
tests when comparing models M7 and M8 even in the
absence of positive selection. To take account for the elevated type I error rates, the original model M8 was com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/222

pared with a more restricted null model (M8a), where the
extra site class was constrained to have ω = 1. When performing this analysis with the sequence data from the
FoxO3 gene, model M8 did not significantly differ from
model M8a (2ΔL = 0.067, df = 1, P > 0.05), indicating that
the estimated ω = 1.36 was not significantly different than
1 and that there was little indication of positive selection
in this gene. Further, our observation of strong purifying
selection being the primary mode of evolution throughout the FoxO phylogeny is consistent with the findings of
a recent study about forkhead family [67,68].
When we performed branch-site model analysis, we
found relaxed functional constraint was most consistent
with the molecular evolutionary analyses of the FoxO
data. Our conclusion is in contrast to a previous study
which concluded that one site was found to be under positive selection in the FoxO3 lineage [67]. In our paper, we
applied the modified branch-site model A of [45] in two
consecutive tests (test1 and test2 in [46]) to the same
alignment used for the site-based models, but we could
not detected the positive selection site. To determine why
these two articles are giving drastically different results, we
had a look at the sequences used for branch-site model
analysis in [67], and we found that only 12 sequences (4
for FoxO3) used for testing evolution selection. Test 2 is a
more direct test for identifying positive selections in the
foreground branch, and significant LRT from test 1 can be
resulted from either positive selection or relaxed selective
constraint in the foreground branch [46], however, the
power of this method may be limited when sample size or
divergence time is low [46]. Therefore, we concluded that
the contradiction between our results and the previous
study [67] due to the number of sequences used for analysis. Moreover, our work on site-model analysis, relative
rate test and physicochemical changes indicated that
FoxO6 was under positive selection. Four positive selected
sites were identified by site-model analysis, two (264K,
266P, corresponding to mouse Gly337 and Pro339) of them
fell into the region of non-conserved optimal PKB motif
in the C-terminal part (Thr338) [69]. The C-terminal PKB
recognition sequence is not conserved in FoxO6 [13].
Besides a PKB phosphorylation motif, this region contains
a stretch of 3 additional serine residues, present in the
other members of the FoxO group, but FoxO6. All these
suggest that these serines may be functionally important
in the other sequences analyzed with the exception of
FoxO6 gene, and positive selection may lead to functional
divergence between FoxO6 and the other members too.
Another two positive selective site are Gly545 and Pro550 in
the mouse Foxo6, and the functional role remains elusive.
That is to say that the real reason for their accelerated evolution is unclear. However, it should be mentioned that
there is a gap in the knowledge of the relationship
between amino acid sequence and structure for full-length

FoxO sequence, and we are unable to speculate on the
particular role of this region in these FoxO6 genes. Unfortunately, the shared evolutionary history and molecular
selection alone cannot be used as the unique criterion to
infer protein function, and the true nature of each FoxO
gene needs to be determined experimentally and independently. Therefore, the positively selected site may play
an important functional role and could represent an interesting target site for future mutagenesis experiment thus
facilitating our understanding of the structure-function
relationships in FoxO genes. Molecular testing is required
to validate this hypothesis. The result from branch-site
analysis (relaxation of functional constraints) of FoxO6
also differs somewhat from previously signature of positive selection. We infer that the weak positive selection
and multiple branches are considered as foreground
branch may explain this phenomenon, because power
will be reduced unless the same sites and selective constraints are occurring along all foreground branches [46].

Conclusion
Genomic data have provided an opportunity to gain a better understanding about the evolution of FoxOs using
phylogenetic analyses. The FoxO gene family phylogeny
showed that two duplications took place early in the evolution of vertebrates and triggered diversification of the
FoxO gene family into four groups. However, further
genome projects on a greater diversity of evolutionary lineages would help better understand the gene-duplication
history. The relative rate analysis and physicochemical
changes indicated that FoxO6 seemed to be different from
other members. Evolutionary rate analysis showed that
molecular adaptation can also play an important role in
the evolution of this gene family. Indeed, positive selection was likely involved in the functional differentiation
of FoxO6 gene; likewise, relaxed selection might play
important roles over evolutionary time and shape variation of some members of the family. Considering the evolutionary history of the FoxO gene family, we provided
insight into which amino acid residues might have undergone positive selection and could be targeted for sitedirected mutagenesis. However, the identification of four
sites under positive selection requires supporting evidence
from further functional experiments to demonstrate the
adaptive character of the amino acids. All these studies
and experiments will certainly contribute to better understand the precise role of natural selection and functional
divergence of this family.
