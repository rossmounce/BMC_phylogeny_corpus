Abstract
Background: Chromodomain-containing Gypsy LTR retrotransposons or chromoviruses are widely distributed among
eukaryotes and have been found in plants, fungi and vertebrates. The previous comprehensive survey of
chromoviruses from mosses (Bryophyta) suggested that genomes of non-seed plants contain the clade which is
closely related to the retrotransposons from fungi. The origin, distribution and evolutionary history of this clade
remained unclear mainly due to the absence of information concerning the diversity and distribution of LTR
retrotransposons in other groups of non-seed plants as well as in fungal genomes.
Results: In present study we preformed in silico analysis of chromodomain-containing LTR retrotransposons in 25
diverse fungi and a number of plant species including spikemoss Selaginella moellendorffii (Lycopodiophyta) coupled
with an experimental survey of chromodomain-containing Gypsy LTR retrotransposons from diverse non-seed vascular
plants (lycophytes, ferns, and horsetails). Our mining of Gypsy LTR retrotransposons in genomic sequences allowed
identification of numerous families which have not been described previously in fungi. Two new well-supported
clades, Galahad and Mordred, as well as several other previously unknown lineages of chromodomain-containing
Gypsy LTR retrotransposons were described based on the results of PCR-mediated survey of LTR retrotransposon
fragments from ferns, horsetails and lycophytes. It appeared that one of the clades, namely Tcn1 clade, was present in
basidiomycetes and non-seed plants including mosses (Bryophyta) and lycophytes (genus Selaginella).
Conclusions: The interkingdom distribution is not typical for chromodomain-containing LTR retrotransposons clades
which are usually very specific for a particular taxonomic group. Tcn1-like LTR retrotransposons from fungi and nonseed plants demonstrated high similarity to each other which can be explained by strong selective constraints and the
'retained' genes theory or by horizontal transmission.
Background
Retrotransposons are a class of mobile genetic elements,
which use reverse transcription in their transposition.
Five orders of retrotransposons are recognized: those
having long terminal repeats (LTRs) (LTR retrotransposons); those lacking LTRs (non-LTR retrotransposons);
DIRS retrotransposons; Penelope-like retrotransposable
elements; and short interspersed nuclear elements
(SINEs). According to the modern classification, LTR ret* Correspondence: novikova@bionet.nsc.ru

rotransposons are divided into several superfamilies:
Copia (Pseudoviridae), Gypsy (Metaviridae), Bel-Pao,
Retrovirus (Retroviridae), and ERV [1].
Chromodomain-containing LTR retrotransposons or
chromoviruses are the most widespread lineage of Gypsy
LTR retrotransposons and are present in genomes of
fungi as well as in plants and vertebrates [2,3]. The characteristic feature of chromoviruses is the presence of an
additional domain - the chromodomain (CHD). CHDs
are present in various eukaryotic proteins involved in
chromatin remodeling and regulation of gene expression
during development [4-6]. CHDs perform a wide range of

diverse functions including chromatin targeting and proteinDNA/RNA interactions [6]. Recently, it has been
shown that the CHDs target integration of new LTR retrotransposon copies into heterochromatin by recognizing
histone modifications [7].
Our previous comprehensive survey of chromoviruses
from mosses (Bryophyta) suggested that the diversity of
CHD-containing Gypsy LTR retrotransposons in plant
genomes is underestimated [8,9]. There are four wellknown CHD-containing Gypsy LTR retrotransposon
clades widely distributed among gymnosperms and
angiosperms: Tekay, CRM, Galadriel and Reina [2,3].
Four novel clades were found to be present in mosses.
Moreover, we showed that representatives from one of
the moss-specific clades are more closely related to retrotransposons from fungi than to retrotransposons from
plants. Although we proposed that the retrotransposons
from this clade could have been 'retained' from the last
common ancestor of Fungi/Metazoa lineage and plants,
the origin of this clade remains unclear.
The questions addressed in current investigation are as
follows: (1) what kind of Gypsy LTR retrotransposons
from fungi are closely related to the LTR retrotransposons detected in mosses; (2) how widely those clades
which were previously identified in mosses are distributed among other non-seed plants including lycophytes,
ferns and horsetails; and (3) what is the origin of the clade
which is common for non-seed plants and fungi. The in
silico analysis of Gypsy LTR retrotransposons in 25 species of fungi, genomes of which available in public databases, along with survey of related LTR retrotransposons
from whole genome sequences (WGS) and expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) of diverse plants including spikemoss Selaginella moellendorffii (Lycopodiophyta) and
PCR-based screening of ferns, horsetails and lycophytes
showed that a common clade of CHD-containing Gypsy
LTR retrotransposons can be found in mosses, lycophytes
from genus Selaginella, and basidiomycetes. According to
the classification of CHD-containing Gypsy LTR retrotransposons proposed by Gorinsek et al. (2004) [3] this
clade has name Tcn1. It seems that Tcn1 is a unique clade
of chromoviruses which has a wide inter-kingdom distribution. Tcn1-like LTR retrotransposons from fungi and
non-seed plants demonstrated higher similarity to each
other in comparison with LTR retrotransposons from
other clades. This can be explained by strong selective
constraints and the 'retained' genes theory or by horizontal transmission.

Results
Gypsy LTR retrotransposons survey from fungal genomes

The Gypsy LTR retrotransposons mining from fungal
genomes was initiated in an attempt to identify retrotransposons closely related to those which were found

Page 2 of 20

in mosses (Bryophyta) [8]. The survey was performed
using genome sequence data for the 25 fungal species
listed in Table 1. The hemiascomycetous yeasts were not
included in the present investigation since a comprehensive survey of LTR retrotransposons from this group of
ascomycetes was recently published [10]. First, reverse
transcriptase (RT) and integrase (Int) coding regions of
Gypsy LTR retrotransposons were detected in genomic
sequences using algorithm based on hidden Markov
model implemented in uGENE software http://
ugene.unipro.ru/. The transposable elements thus identified were then classified into families based on RT and Int
domains sequence similarity. Members of the same family shared high amino acid identity (90-100%) but had
very little similarity to elements from other families. Our
survey has identified more than 150 novel Gypsy LTR retrotransposon families which have not been described
previously (Additional file 1).
The newly identified Gypsy LTR retrotransposons fall
into two major, distinct lineages according to phylogenetic analysis based on RT and partial Int domains: chromoviruses
(or
CHD-containing
Gypsy
LTR
retrotransposons) and Ylt1-like LTR retrotransposons.
Two retrotransposons (LacBicTy3-15 from Laccaria
bicolor and CopConTy3-14 from Coprinus cinereus)
formed their own lineage closely related to Ylt1-like LTR
retrotransposons. This lineage cannot be attributed to
Ylt1 because of low bootstrap support (only 64%; Figure
1) and was named SN_1006. Ylt1-like LTR retrotransposons were found in a number of fungal species (Figure 1).
Previously, Ylt1-like LTR retrotransposons were reported
for Yarrowia lipolytica (original Ylt1 retrotransposon)
[11], Candida albicans (Tca3 element) [12], and basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans [13]. In the present
study, LTR retrotransposons belonging to the Ylt1 lineage
have been found in both ascomycete and basidiomycete
fungi. They fall into several clearly separated groups: the
branch formed by transposable elements from Basidiomycota, the group of retrotransposons from ascomycetes,
and the branch of the original Ylt1 LTR retrotransposon
(Figure 1).
Twenty monophyletic clades can be recognized in the
phylogenetic tree of fungal CHD-containing Gypsy LTR
retrotransposons, nine of which have been previously
reported [3]. Thirteen clades are specific for ascomycetes
(Nessie, Pyret, Maggy, Pyggy, MGLR3, Yeti, Coccy1,
Coccy2, Polly, Afut1, Tf1, Ty3, and Afut4), six have been
found only in genomes of basidiomycetes (MarY1,
Laccy1, Laccy2, Tcn2, Puccy1, and Puccy2) and one clade
(Tcn1) is present in both basidiomycetes and chytridiomycetes (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis JEL423) (Figure 2).
For each of the newly identified retrotransposon families, we attempted to isolate a full-length representative

or to reconstruct it using overlaps between partial
sequences. The lengths of the elements thus identified
varied greatly from approximately 4.4 kb to more than 13
kb. The structural features for each family are listed in
Additional Table S1 (Additional file 1). The majority of
full-length LTR retrotransposons had either a single open
reading frame (ORF) encoding a fused Gag-Pol polyprotein or two ORFs encoding separate proteins (Figure 3).
The Gag protein sequences differed greatly between families. Nevertheless, cysteine motifs characterized by the
amino acid sequence C-X2-C-X4-H-X4-C (CCHC) were
found in Gag for some of the identified Gypsy LTR retrotransposons (see Additional file 1). The Pol polyproteins sequences were more conserved than Gag,
especially with the RT and Int domains. RT, Int, PR (proteinase) and chromodomains (CHDs, in chromoviruses)
were detected. Characteristic motifs were found throughout the Gag and Pol sequences of all of the putative intact
element copies.
In addition to the abovelisted enzymatic domains, a
deoxyuridine triphosphatase domain (dUTPase) has been
found in several LTR retrotransposons from the basidiomycete Postia placenta MAD-698. The location of this

domain varied among diverse families of PosPlaTy3 elements. It can be found either at amino-terminus
(PosPlaTy3-3) and carboxyl-terminus of Pol (PosPlaTy34) or between PR and RT domains (PosPlaTy3-5) (Figure
3). The presence of dUTPase in LTR retrotransposon
sequences has been described earlier for the elements
from a basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium and
an ascomycete Tuber melanosporum [14,15]. The role
and origin of this domain remained unclear. Moreover, it
seems that the described LTR retrotransposons acquire
this domain independently from different sources (Additional file 2) [14]. It was assumed that the presence of
dUTPase allows viruses that contain this domain to replicate in non-dividing cells, in which cellular dUTPase
activity is absent because replication of DNA does not
occur [16].
Tnc1 clade is found in non-seed plants

Further phylogenetic analysis revealed that previously
described CHD-containing LTR retrotransposons from
mosses including PpatensLTR retrotransposons isolated
from genomic sequence of moss Physcomitrella patens
formed a common branch with Tcn1-like LTR retrotransposons from fungi (Figure 4) [8]. In an attempt to deter-

mine the distribution of the Tcn1clade among plants, we
used public databases for further survey of LTR retrotransposons including genomic databases for red and
green algae, spikemoss Selaginella moellendorffii, and
seed plants (see Materials and Methods section). A Tcn1like LTR retrotransposon search was implemented with
BLAST (blastp and blastx). Amino acid sequences of RT
and Int domains of known Tcn1-like (Tcn1 from C. neoformans, Ccchromovir1 and Ccchromovir2 from C.
cinereus, PcMetavir6 from Phanerochaete chrysosporium,
and PpatensLTRs from P. patens) and newly identified
retrotransposons (SpoRosTy3-4 and BatDenTy3-1) were
used as the queries. The Tcn1-like LTR retrotransposons
were identified only in the whole genomic sequence of
Selaginella moellendorffii (SM-Tcn1, Figure 4); none of
the tested algae or seed plant genomes contained LTR
retrotransposons from this clade. It seems that the Tcn1
clade can be found in basidiomycetes and chytridiomycetes fungi as well as non-seed plants (Bryophyta and
Lycopodiophyta).

The whole sequence of SM-Tcn1 LTR retrotransposon
was obtained from WGS. SM-Tcn1 is 5704 bp in length
and carries two putative ORFs. ORF1 or gag (969 bp in
length) encodes a 323 amino acid (aa) protein with strong
similarity to retroviral Gag proteins (pfam03732). ORF2
or pol (3714 bp) encodes a 1238 aa polyprotein, with
characteristic retroviral aspartyl protease (PR), RT, Int,
and CHD domains (Figure 3; Additional file 3). SM-Tcn1
possesses 440 bp LTRs with conserved features, including
the dinucleotide end sequences (TG...CA). Target site
duplication (AACAC...AACAC) was also detected for the
described copy of SM-Tcn1. The LTRs contained TATA
and CAAT boxes. No putative primer-binding site (PBS)
was found. The PBS is necessary for initiation of reverse
transcription and synthesis of the first strand complementary 5'LTR sequence [17]. Typical PBS is located near
the 5'LTR and complementary to the 3' terminal nucleotides of the primer tRNA used for initiation. Other
known mechanism for initiation of the first strand synthesis is self-priming, in this case a sequence derived
from LTR is located just downstream of the 5'LTR [18,19].
However, evidences were found neither for tRNA priming nor for self-priming of SM-Tcn1 LTR retrotransposon. The sequence presented between 5' LTR and gag is
conservative and thymine-rich (Figure 3). The possible
mechanism for initiation of reverse transcription of SMTcn1 remained unclear. A polypurine tract (PPT) was
detected immediately upstream of the 3'LTR. The PPT
sequence is involved in second-strand DNA synthesis.
The BLAST search (blastn) of full-length SM-Tcn1 retrotransposon indicated the presence of more than 200
hits in the S. moellendorffii genome. The close examination of identified copies showed that they have in average
91.7% nucleotide identity with the original SM-Tcn1
sequence. A BLAST search (tblastn) using SM-Tcn1
putative Pol protein as a query yielded more than 500
hits. The size of S. moellendorffii genome is only ~100
Mbp [20], thus SM-Tcn1 retrotransposons comprise ca.
1.5% of genomic sequence.
Gypsy LTR retrotransposons from non-seed vascular plants

The bioinformatic survey of CHD-containing Gypsy LTR
retrotransposons, which allowed us to identify Tcn1-like
retrotransposons in a few basidiomycetes, P. patens and S.
moellendorffii, did not provide a satisfactory answer to
the question concerning distribution of this clade among
non-seed vascular plants. Therefore, we used PCR with
degenerate primers to investigate the distribution of
CHD-containing Gypsy LTR retrotransposons in 26 ferns
and horsetails (monilophytes) belonging to three classes:
Psilotopsida, Polypodiopsida and Equisetopsida, and in
10 lycophytes from two classes: Isoetopsida and Lycopodiopsida (Table 2).

Figure 3 Structural organization of a number of full-length LTR
retrotransposons from fungi and SM-Tcn1 LTR retrotransposon
from spikemoss Selaginella moellendorffii identified in present
study. The clade for each of elements is shown on the left. Abbreviations: LTR - long terminal repeat, TSD - target site duplication, PR - proteinase, RT - reverse transcriptase, RH - ribonuclease H, Int - core

tract, PBS? - no putative primer-binding site was found for SM-Tcn1.

The estimated diversity of monilophytes (= Infradivision Moniliformopses) is about 9000 species and includes
horsetails, whisk ferns, and all eusporangiate and leptosporangiate ferns [19]. Most of the species examined in
the present study were leptosporangiate ferns from the
order Polypodiales, class Polypodiopsida. This order covers more than 80% of current known diversity of ferns
[21]. Additionally, one representative of heterosporous
ferns, Salvinia natans (Polypodiopsida, Salviniales), two
ophioglossoid ferns (Psilotopsida, Ophioglossales) and
three horsetails (Equisetopsida, Equisetales) were
included [22]. Lycophytes are much less diverse in comparison with monilophytes and comprise less than 1% of
extant land plants (around 1200 living species). Three
major lineages are distinguished among lycophytes: clubmosses and firmosses (Lycopodiaceae), spikemosses
(Selaginellaceae), and quillworts (Isoetaceae) [23].
Among lycophytes included in the present study are Isoetes and Huperzia species (Isoetaceae) as well as two
Selaginella species (Selaginellaceae), which belong to the
class Isoetopsida, and seven diverse species from Lycopodiaceae (Lycopodiales, Lycopodiopsida).
The presence of CHD-containing Gypsy LTR retroelements among the listed plants was tested by amplifying
genomic DNA with previously developed degenerate oligonucleotide primers [8,24]. Consistent with the spacing
of reverse transcriptase (RT) domains, the amplified PCR
products were approximately 320 bp in length. In total, 98
clones with sequence similarity to known RT sequences
were isolated, of which 76 were from monilophytes and
22 from lycophytes. The preliminary blastp search

Page 7 of 20

revealed that 10 clones were not from CHDcontaining
LTR retrotransposons but were from Athila-like Gypsy
elements (Additional file 4). Many representatives of this
clade possess not only classical gag and pol sequences,
but also an additional open reading frame that might
encode an env-like protein [25,26].
The phylogenetic relationships among obtained clones
and known CHD-containing Gypsy LTR retrotransposons, extracted from databases, were reconstructed using
neighbor-joining (NJ) analysis based on the multiple
alignment of nucleotide sequences of RT fragment (Figure 4). The Gypsy LTR retrotransposons from Drosophila
melanogaster were used as an outgroup. The newlyidentified LTR retrotransposon grouped into four large clusters
on the phylogenetic tree. The group of clones from
diverse monilophytes and one LTR retrotransposon from
lycophytes Lycopodium alpinum (LycAlpTy3-1 clone)
form a common group with previously described retroelements from mosses Tetraphis pellucida and Vesicularia dubyana [8]. Although the bootstrap support is
below 50% (data not shown), this new clade (named
"Galahad") seems to be a sister group to the Galadriel
clade. Galahad appears to be one of the oldest widely distributed clades of CHD-containing LTR retrotransposons
from plants. Since Galahad clade was found in all nonseed plants including mosses, the probable age of this
clade would be in the range of 400-700 Myr, which is estimated time divergence of liverworts and mosses from
vascular plants [27].
The second group is formed by LTR retrotransposons
from both monilophytes and lycophytes. The phylogenetic analysis did not provide support for a monophyletic
origin of this cluster. Moreover, the relationships inside
the cluster remained unclear, with the exception of several lineages. One of the lineages ('a' in Figure 4), contained members from lycophytes in the family
Lycopodiaceae: Lycopodium clavatum (LycClavGty3
clones), L. japonicum (LycJapGty3-1 clone), and Diphasiastrum complanatum (DiphComGty3 clones). Another
lineage seems to have had a long-term association with
fern genomes, since it appears to be widely distributed
among leptosporangiate ferns and can be found in
Dennstaedtiaceae (Pteridium aquilinum), Pteridaceae
(Adiantum pedatum), Aspleniaceae (Asplenium viride),
Woodsiaceae (Athyrium distentifolium and Cystopteris
fragilis), and Dryopteridaceae (Dryopteris crassirhizoma
and Polystichum tripteron) (lineage 'b' on Figure 4). Additionally, five satellite lineages, represented mostly by single clones can be found on the phylogenetic tree.
The largest group is represented by 37 LTR retrotransposons. Three clearly separated clusters can be found
inside this group (marked as 'd', 'f', and Mordred on Figure 4). One of these clusters is formed by LTR retrotransposons from Ophioglossaceae (Botrychium multifidum),

Aspleniaceae (A. viride) and Dryopteridaceae (Dryopteris
expansa, D. carthusiana, and D. crassirhizoma). The second cluster has a bootstrap support of 77% and is represented by clones isolated from Lycopodium annotinum
(Lycopodiaceae) and Woodsia polystichoides (Woodsiaceae). The last monophyletic cluster, clade Mordred, is
the largest, well-supported clade which is widely distributed among representatives of all investigated classes
except Isoetopsida. It was found to be present in fern
genomes from families Ophioglossaceae (Ophioglossum
vulgatum and Botrychium multifidum), Pteridaceae (Adiantum pedatum), Woodsiaceae (Athyrium sinense, A. distentifolium, A. monomachii, C. fragilis, and W.
polystichoides), Onocleaceae (Onoclea sensibilis), and
Dryopteridaceae (Dryopteris filix-mas and D. crassirhizoma); in horsetails Equisetum hiemale and E. fluviatile
(Equisetaceae); and lycophyte Lycopodium magellanicum
(Lycopodiaceae).
The Tcn1-like LTR retrotransposons were detected
only in Selaginella species, S. kraussiana (SelKraGty3
clones) and S. pulvinata (SelPulGty3 clones) in addition
to the previously described LTR retrotransposons from
mosses and SM-Tcn1 LTR retrotransposon from Selaginella moellendorffii (Figure 4) [8]. The absence of Tcn1like clones isolated from other lycophytes, ferns, and
horsetails can be explained by failed PCR amplification
due to the high divergence of Tcn1-like elements in
genomes of these species or, more likely, by lack of these
elements from their genomes.
Tcn1-like LTR retrotransposons: 'retained' or horizontally
transmitted?

As a rule chromoviruses clades are specific for a particular group of eukaryotic organisms such as Ascomycota
fungi (Nessie, Pyret, Maggy, Pyggy, MGLR3, Yeti, Coccy1,
Coccy2, Polly, Afut1, Tf1, Ty3, and Afut4), Basidiomycota
fungi (MarY1, Laccy1, Laccy2, Tcn2, Puccy1, and
Puccy2), or plants (Reina, CRM, Tekay, Galadriel, and
Chlamyvir as well as additional less investigated clades
from mosses) [3,8]. In the light of such specificity, it was
unexpected to find a clade containing elements from
basidiomycetes and non-seed plants. Nevertheless, it
seems that Tcn1 clade has an interkingdom distribution
and can be found in a number of fungi, diverse mosses
(Bryophyta) as well as in lycophytes (genus Selaginella).
Such a wide distribution makes the Tcn1 clade unique
among the CHD-containing Gypsy LTR retrotransposons. The interkingdom distribution of Tcn1 clade could
be the result of horizontal transmission (HT) of LTR retrotransposons among fungi and plants; otherwise, Tcn1like LTR retrotransposons could have been 'retained' by
mosses and lycophytes from the most recent common
ancestor of plants and Fungi/Metazoa lineage of eukaryotes [8,28].

Page 11 of 20

The hypothesis of 'retained' genes is based on the
observation that EST data of Physcomitrella contained a
fraction of transcripts derived from putative genes
('retained' genes), which are not present in seed plants
but can be found in other kingdoms including fungi. It
was proposed that such retained genes along with Physcomitrella-specific (or moss-specific) genes encode
functions that make mosses unique in terms of physiology and metabolism [28]. We used these data and compared the levels of similarity for RT-Int fragments from
Tcn1-like LTR retrotransposons and two putatively
retained genes from Physcomitrella, which showed a high
similarity with functional genes from fungi: uric acidxanthine permease (uapA, TIGR00801) and inorganic
phosphate transporter (Pho88, pfam10032).
The pairwise comparisons between hypothetical Pho88
proteins from basidiomycetes Coprinus cinereus
Okayama7#130, Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Cryptococcus neoformans revealed 51.3% to 64.9% similarity
whereas only 23.0% identical amino acid residues was
found on average in pairwise comparisons between fungal proteins and putative Pho88 from Physcomitrella
(Table 3). The most closely related homolog for putative
Pho88 from P. patens was found in Schizosaccharomyces
pombe (26.8% of similarity). The similarity between uapA
from Physcomitrella and Cryptococcus (36.9%) was
almost the same as between proteins from Cryptococcus
and Coprinus (39.6%) or Cryptococcus and Phanerochaete
(43.2%). More then 67% of amino acid residues are identical in permeases from Coprinus and Phanerochaete. Predicted uapA from Ashbya gossypii and Physcomitrella
share 40.7% of amino acid residues.
It seems to be that the hypothesis of 'retained' genes
cannot be implemented as explanation for Tcn1 clade distribution since investigated RT-Int fragments of Tcn1-like
LTR retrotransposons from fungi and plants have higher
similarity to each other than functional proteins which
were proposed to be 'retained' [28]. RT-Int fragments
from Tcn1-like LTR retrotransposons have average similarity 49%. Moreover, evolutionary rates estimated for
Tcn1 LTR retrotransposons appeared to be less than evolutionary rates for 'retained' genes or other LTR retrotransposons (Table 3).

Discussion
Despite a number of whole genome sequence studies, the
distribution and diversity of CHD-containing Gypsy LTR
retrotransposons is still poorly understood. Current
knowledge of distribution and evolution of this group of
mobile elements has been mainly obtained from diverse
model organisms [3]. The quickly generated massive data
sets (for example, WGS and EST databases) provide a
great opportunity to perform detailed analysis for nonmodel organisms. Experimental data accumulation also

should not be neglected. In the absence of information
about genomic sequences from monilophytes, PCR
screening seems to be very useful for isolation and characterization of new LTR retrotransposons from this
group of non-seed vascular plants. Two new well-supported clades, Galahad and Mordred, as well as several
other previously unknown lineages of CHD-containing
Gypsy LTR retrotransposons were described based on the
results of PCR-mediated survey of RT fragments from
ferns, horsetails and lycophytes.
One of the clades originally described for fungal
genomes, Tcn1, appeared to be present in genomes of
mosses (Bryophytes) and lycophytes (genus Selaginella)
(Figure 5). Such an interkingdom distribution is not typical for CHD-containing LTR retrotransposons clades
which are usually very specific for a particular taxonomic
group [see [8]]. Data suggested that horizontal transmission took place between fungi and non-seed plants (probably mosses and lycophytes). Horizontal transmissions or
horizontal transfers (HTs) of mobile elements are usually

recognized by the presence of very closely related mobile
elements in distant host taxa [29-33]. HT is well known
for gypsy LTR retrotransposons in Drosophila [30] and
has been suggested to have occurred in plants [2,24].
Recently, the evidence was provided for HT of RIRE1 LTR
retrotransposon between representatives of genus Oryza
[32] and Route66 LTR retrotransposon between representatives of Panicoideae (Poaceae) and several species of
the genus Oryza [33].
Several criteria can be used for HT event recognition.
The first criterion is inconsistencies between the phylogenies of transposable elements (TEs) and host species
[29,34]. There are potential problems with application of
this criterion for HT detection. Multiple transposable element lineages can be present within genomes. Moreover,
transposable elements are multicopy components of
genomes. Comparisons of paralogous copies instead of
orthologs along with varying rates of their sequence evolution are the main sources for incongruence in phylogenetic analysis, this could be misidentified as HT. The

Novikova et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:231
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/231

second criterion, which seems to offer the strongest evidence, is a higher degree of observed sequence similarity
for transposable elements than for functional genes, so
called 'slowdown effect on evolutionary rates'. Once
inserted, a new copy of transposable element is presumed
to evolve without functional constrains. Thus, all types of
mutations should have an equal chance to be fixed [35].
The lower than expected sequence divergence of TEs in
comparison with non-mobile nuclear genes of the host
species can be explained either by strong selective constraints in TE sequence coupled with a strict vertical
transmission, or by horizontal transfer [31,36,37]. The
third criterion of inferring HT is the discontinuous distribution of TEs among closely related taxa, i.e., presence of
a TE in one lineage and its absence in a sister lineage.
Such discontinuous distribution could be due to random
loss of TEs, ancestral polymorphism, or independent
sorting of copies into descendant species. By itself, this
kind of evidence provides only weak support for HT since
TE can be lost through population dynamics or ecological
forces that are difficult to reconstruct [38,39].
All three criteria are satisfied in case of Tcn1-like LTR
retrotransposons. They demonstrated patchy distribution
among fungi and plants (Figure 5). They were found in all
investigated mosses, but only in a few lycophytes and
they absent in basal lineages of green plants such as green

according to Bowman et al., 2007 [40] and Berbee and Taylor, 2001 [41]
with minor modifications. Divergence times (Mya - million years ago)
are indicated according to Hedges, 2002 [27]. Data suggest that Tcn1like LTR retrotransposons were horizontally transmitted between fungi
and non-seed plants (indicated by arrows). Presumably HT took place
among fungi and the last common ancestor (LCA) of mosses and lycophytes (indicated as 1). Alternatively, it is possible that two independent acts of HT occurred (indicated as 2). First HT event could happen
among fungi and LCA of mosses since all investigated mosses contain
Tcn1-like LTR retrotransposons. The second HT could occur among
fungi and LCA of Selaginella since only representatives of this genus
carry this group of retrotransposons among all the investigated lycophytes.

and red algae as well as in all seed plants investigated so
far. The hypothesis of 'retained' genes in moss Physcomitrella represented an attractive alternative to horizontal
transmission as an explanation of the phylogenetic inconsistencies as well as the existence of a number of functional genes in Physcomitrella genome, which seem to
have non-plant origin and can be found in bacteria, fungi
and protozoa but not in higher plants [28]. Nevertheless,
the most important feature of Tcn1-like LTR retrotransposons in the context of HT is their lower evolutionary
rates in comparison with other groups of CHD-containing LTR retrotransposons. The close examination and
comparison of evolutionary rates for LTR retrotransposons including representatives of Tcn1, Pyggy and Pyret
clades, and evolutionary rates estimated for putatively
'retained' genes suggests that a horizontal transmission of
Tcn1-like LTR retrotransposons took place among fungi
and the last common ancestor (LCA) of mosses and lycophytes (Table 3 and Figure 5) [27]. Alternatively, it is possible, but highly unlikely, that two independent acts of HT
occurred. First HT event could happen among fungi and
LCA of mosses since all investigated mosses contain
Tcn1-like LTR retrotransposons [8]. The second HT
could occur among fungi and LCA of Selaginella since
only representatives of this genus carry this group of retrotransposons among all investigated lycophytes (Figure
4 and Figure 5). It is necessary to note that despite HT
seeming to be a preferable explanation for the observed
distribution. The evidence is not strong enough to discard other explanations; such as selective pressure coupled with vertical transmission of retrotransposons in
genomes of non-seed plants and loss of these elements by
other plants.
Another putative case of HT based on the results of
present survey of LTR retrotransposons from fungal species was found for PyrTriTy3-2 LTR retrotransposon
from Pyrenophora tritici-repentis Pt-1C-BFP (Dothideomycetes). PyrTriTy3-2 belongs to Pyggy clade and
appeared to be more closely related to LTR retrotransposons from Sordariomycetes (NecHaemTy3-4 from Nectria haematococca MPVI and ChaGloTy3-8 from
Chaetomium globosum CBS 148.51) than to the elements
from other Dothideomycetes such as AltBraTy3-2 from
Alternaria brassicicola ATCC 96866, REAL from Alternaria alternata (AB025309) [42], and PYGGY from
Pyrenophora graminea (AF533704) [43] (Figure 2). The
pairwise comparisons of RT-Int fragments and investigation of evolutionary rates for retrotransposons from
Pyggy and Pyret clades revealed the unexpectedly high
similarity between PyrTriTy3-2 and NecHaemTy3-4 (77%
identical amino acids), much higher than between any
other retrotransposons from Pyggy or Pyret clades, and
at least two times lower evolutionary rate in the couple

Novikova et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:231
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/231

PyrTriTy3-2/NecHaemTy3-4 than in comparisons of
other LTR retrotransposons (Table 3).
The high similarity, phylogenetic inconsistencies, as
well as lower evolutionary rates could be explained by
very strict evolutionary constraints or a HT event. However, taking into consideration that the high selective
pressure could be implemented only in the case of functional importance of the PyrTriTy3-2 or NecHaemTy3-4,
HT looks more preferable for the explanation of the
described case. It is known that transposable elements
can alter gene expression since they carry their own regulatory sequences and insertions can be selectively advantageous. However, only those transposable elements,
which were involved in regulation, evolve under strict
selective pressure [44,45].
While extremely rare, horizontal transfer seems to be
quite common and recurrent in eukaryotes. An incomplete list of putative HT events includes: HT as a key
event in the evolution of several fungal genes [46-48]; HT
from fungi to rice weevil Sitophilus oryzae proposed for
pectinase gene [49]; numerous HT events described for
eukaryotic transposable elements [30-38]; as well as HTs
of mitochondrial genes, for example, multiple angiosperm-angiosperm HTs of homing group I intron in the
mitochondrial cox1 gene (for a review, see [50]); and a HT
of the intron II and two adjacent exons of the mitochondrial nad1 gene from the flowering plants (angiosperms)
to Gnetum (gymnosperms) [51].
The actual mechanisms of horizontal transfer for
eukaryotic genes and transposable elements are still
unknown since it is not possible to show experimentally
how HT can occur. Parasites, symbionts, bacteria, or
viruses all could be suggested as potential vectors for horizontal transfer. Moreover, based on an example of massive HT from a land plant donor to the basal angiosperm
Amborella trichopoda, it has been demonstrated that
direct plant-to-plant transfer can take a place [52]. The
associations between biotrophic fungi and their plant
hosts are ubiquitous in nature and range from mutually
beneficial to potentially fatal pathogenic interactions.
Mycorrhiza refers to an association or symbiosis between
plants and fungi that colonize the cortical tissue of plant
roots. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are mostly basidiomycetes
that grow between root cortical cells of many tree species
whereas arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi belong to the
order Glomales (Glomeromycota) and form highly
branched structures called arbuscules, within root cortical cells of wide range of land plant species [53-55]. Both
types of mycorrhiza represent intimate association and
could provide suitable conditions for HT of transposable
elements. AM-like mycorrhiza is widely distributed
among mosses, ferns and lycophytes (for review, [53]).

Conclusions
Tcn1-like LTR retrotransposons were found in basidiomycota fungi and non-seed plants, including all investigated mosses and lycophytes from genus Selaginella.
Such interkingdom distribution is not typical for chromodomain-containing LTR retrotransposons clades
which are usually very specific for a particular taxonomic
group and can be explained by strong selective constraints and the 'retained' genes theory or by horizontal
transmission. The close examination and comparison of
evolutionary rates for LTR retrotransposons including
representatives of Tcn1 and two other clades of LTR retrotransposons, and evolutionary rates estimated for putatively 'retained' genes from mosses and fungi suggests
that a horizontal transmission of Tcn1-like LTR retrotransposons took place among fungi and mosses/lycophytes. However the evidence is not strong enough to
discard other explanations; such as selective pressure
coupled with vertical transmission of retrotransposons in
genomes of non-seed plants and loss of these elements by
other plants.
Methods
Genomic sequences screening, sequence and phylogenetic
analysis

Fungal genomic sequences are available at: Fungal
Genome Initiative [56]; The DOE Joint Genome Institute
[57]; and The Sanger Institute [58]. The source of individual genomes can be found in table represented in Additional file 5.
We used UniPro uGENE software [59] for LTR retrotransposons identification. The designed pipeline for
Gypsy LTR retrotransposons identification and classification included: loading genomic sequence, translation of
genomic sequence over six possible reading frames to
amino acids, and subsequent search for homologous
regions performed using "HMMER search" options of
UniPro uGENE. The algorithm of HMMER search is
based on profile hidden Markov models, which can perform amino acid sequence searches by use of an appropriate profile [60]. For the analyses, we used a multiple
alignment consensus sequence, which contains Gypsy
LTR retrotransposon reverse transcriptase (RT) and partial integrase (Int) domains. The profile HMM, based on
this consensus sequence, was built using UniPro uGENE
software. An additional test for the presence of RT and
partial Int domains was performed using BLAST (blastp)
which also was incorporated in the designed pipeline. All
BLAST analysis was essentially performed using
sequence databases accessible from the National Center
for Biotechnology Information [61]. The classification of
the newly identified elements was performed by a comparative analysis of their sequences. Newly identified ele-

ments and their accession numbers in public databases
are listed in Additional file 6.
The whole nucleotide sequences of the transposable
elements, if possible, were also extracted with the assistance of UniPro uGENE software. After localization of
amino acid sequences obtained during HMMER search
in the initial genomes in its nucleotide representation, the
sequences were expanded up to 15 Kb and used for long
terminal repeats (LTRs) search. The algorithm for repeats
search, 'Repeat Find', is included to the UniPro uGENE as
well as the visualization feature and 'ORF Find' option
which were used to identify the putatively intact copies of
LTR retrotransposons. Structural features of newly identified LTR retrotransposons can be found in Additional
file 1.
Tcn1-like LTR retrotransposon search was carried out
using BLAST (blastp and blastx). BLAST analysis was
performed using sequence databases accessible from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
server [59], The U.S. Department of Energy Joint
Genome Institute [57], and Broad Institute of MIT and
Harvard [56] as well as Phytozome, a tool for green plant
comparative genomics [62]. The described copy of SMTcn1 from spikemoss Selaginella moellendorffii (Lycopodiophyta) is located in scaffold_0 (1426925-1421008) of
genomic sequence version 1.0 which is available at The
U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute website [57]. The whole sequence of SM-Tcn1 with annotations can be found in Additional file 3. Other websites
used in the present study were: Repbase [63], NCBI conserved domain database and search service [64], ESTs
from Porphyra yezoensis at Kazusa DNA Research Institute [65], Cyanidioschyzon merolae Genome Project [66],
The Plant Genomics Consortium [67], The Institute for
Genomic Research [68], Cassava and Leafy Spurge EST
Project [69].
All multiple DNA alignments were performed by ClustalW [70] and edited manually in UniPro uGENE. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the NeighborJoining (NJ) method in MEGA 4.0 program [71]. Statistical support for the NJ tree was evaluated by bootstrapping (number of replications, 1000) [72]. Evolutionary
rates were estimated by standard methods [73]. Poisson
correction distances (d) were estimated from the equation d = -ln(1 - p), where p represents the proportion of
different amino acids. The rate of amino acid substitution
(r) was estimated by the standard equation r = d/2T,
where T is the divergence time of the last common ancestor of the compared species. The estimated divergence
times used were: Plants/Fungi, 1500 Myr and Basidiomycetes/Ascomycetes, 1200 Myr according to Hedges
(2002) [27]; Homobasidiomycetes/Chytridiomycetes, 900
Myr, Sordaryomycetes/Eurotiomycetes, 540 Myr, and

Sordaryomycetes/Dothideomycetes, 490 Myr according
to Padovan et al. (2005) [74]; and Heterobasidiomycetes
(or Tremellomycetes)/Homobasidiomycetes (Agaricomycetes and Dacrymycetes), 700 Myr according to Hibbett
et al. (2007) [75] and Taylor et al. (2004) [76].
Species collection and total DNA isolation

Table 2 lists plant species, and Table 3 lists fungal species
used in present study. The taxonomy of vascular nonseed plants (monilophytes and lycophytes) is given after
Pryer et al. (2004) [22], Smith et al. (2006) [21], and Korall
et al. (2007) [77]. Plant species (monilophytes) were collected in nature. The detailed label data are available from
the authors. The genomic DNA of lycophytes was provided by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London, UK
[78]. Genomic DNA was isolated from the leaves. Extraction was performed using the QIAGEN DNeasy Plant
Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Isolated DNA was used directly in
PCR amplifications.
Gypsy LTR retrotransposons PCR amplification and
sequencing

Previously designed degenerate PCR primers for chromodomain-containing Gypsy LTR retrotransposons were
used in present study: GyRT1 = 5'-MRNATGTGYGTNGAYTAYMG-3' [24] and ty3-A = 5'-AATTCGCTGCCGCTAAGATNARNADRTCRTC-3' [8], where M = A +
C, Y = C + T, R = A + G, D = A + G + T and N = A + G +
C + T. These primers were designed to amplify the most
conserved part of the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain
of LTR retrotransposons and were proved to be efficient
[8,24]. The expected length of PCR products was about
320 bp. PCR amplification with degenerate primers was
performed using 0.1 μg of genomic DNA in 10-μl volume
of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.9), 1 mM (NH4)2SO4, 4 mM
MgCl2, 200 μM each of four dNTPs, 0.5 μM primers, and
2.5 units of Taq polymerase. After an initial denaturation
step for 3 min at 94°C, the PCR reactions were subjected
to 30 cycles of amplification consisting of 30 sec denaturation at 94°C, 42 sec annealing at 50°C, and 1 min extension at 72°C. PCR products were separated by agarose gel
electrophoresis. The resulting PCR products were
directly ligated into a pGEM vector using a pGEM-TEasy cloning kit (Promega) for sequence determination.
Clones were amplified by PCR with M13 primers, and
40 ng of the product was used in a 10 μl cycle sequencing
reaction with the ABI BigDye Terminator Kit on an ABI
310 Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems); or sequencing reactions were performed with Dye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Kit (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed on CEQ
8000 Genetic Analysis System. Sequences were deposited
to GenBank under Acc. Numbers GQ443314-GQ443445
and AY959294-AY959313.
