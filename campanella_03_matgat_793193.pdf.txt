Abstract
Background: The rapid increase in the amount of protein and DNA sequence information
available has become almost overwhelming to researchers. So much information is now accessible
that high-quality, functional gene analysis and categorization has become a major goal for many
laboratories. To aid in this categorization, there is a need for non-commercial software that is able
to both align sequences and also calculate pairwise levels of similarity/identity.
Results: We have developed MatGAT (Matrix Global Alignment Tool), a simple, easy to use
computer application that generates similarity/identity matrices for DNA or protein sequences
without needing pre-alignment of the data.
Conclusions: The advantages of this program over other software are that it is open-source
freeware, can analyze a large number of sequences simultaneously, can visualize both sequence
alignment and similarity/identity values concurrently, employs global alignment in calculations, and
has been formatted to run under both the Unix and the Microsoft Windows Operating Systems.
We are presently completing the Macintosh-based version of the program.

The application of phylogenetics in the examination of a
genome has been dubbed "phylogenomics" [1–3]. The
analytic process of phylogenomics is taking on more
importance as additional DNA and protein sequences
from a multitude of species become available.

by the end of 1998, had completed sequencing seven
microbial genomes, half of the world total at the time.
Today, TIGR is in the process of sequencing and characterizing the genomes of many major organisms of the world,
including 20 animal, 19 plant, 14 protist, 8 fungal and
over 100 bacterial species http://www.tigr.org.

GenBank has approximately 28 million DNA sequences
in its database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/
genbankstats.html. The number of sequences in GenBank
has increased by five orders of magnitude since its founding in 1982. The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR),

All this new information is obviously a great asset to scientists, since there is constantly new supplementary data
to be employed in genomic, physiologic and genetic
research. The drawback with all of this new information is
that the sheer amount of it has become overwhelming. So

much information is now becoming available that highquality, functional gene analysis and categorization is
becoming a paramount goal.
One of the most important analyses that can be employed
in phylogenomics or phylogenetics is the pairwise determination of similarity or identity between DNA or protein
sequences. The percent identity is the calculated percentage of how two sequences compare at a base-to-base or
residue-to-residue level. The percent similarity is a more
strict calculation where sequence gaps and mismatches
are included in the evaluation and scored using a more
complex formula and a comparison look-up table [4–6].
We have noted that there is a lack of non-commercial software available that is able to both align a series of DNA or
protein sequences and also calculate pairwise levels of
similarity/identity. Timothy Carver's DISTMAT program
http://bioinfo.pbi.nrc.ca:8090/cgi-bin/
emboss.pl?_action=input&_app=distmat calculates pairwise divergence, but not similarity, and it only functions
if the sequences have already been aligned by some other
computer
program.
Pairwise
BLAST
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/bl2seq/bl2.html may also
be used to calculate similarity, but its limitations are that
only two sequences may be analyzed at one time and percent similarity/identity are based on local alignment – not
global alignment [7]. MegAlign, which comes with the
DNASTAR package (DNASTAR, Inc.), also generates similarity matrices, but it is quite expensive and not available
as a stand-alone product.
MatGAT (Matrix Global Alignment Tool) is a simple, easy
to use similarity/identity matrix generator that calculates
the similarity and identity between every pair of
sequences in a given data set without requiring pre-alignment of the data. The program performs a series of pairwise alignments using the Myers and Miller global
alignment algorithm [8], calculates similarity and identity, and then places the results in a distance matrix. In
order to increase alignment speed, they are computed in
the C++ language while the "front-end" of the MatGAT
program is encoded in Java.
We developed MatGAT because of a perceived need. MatGAT runs under both the Unix and Microsoft Windows
Operating Systems. We are presently completing the Macintosh OS X-based version of the program. The program
operates as a native application and makes use of graphical interfaces, allowing the user to employ standard fonts
installed on their machine and printer. Data may be input
into MatGAT by cutting and pasting or using a browse
function for larger files. Files must be plain .txt in the
standard FASTA format. In multiple sequence analysis,
each field must have a FASTA title line starting with a ">"

Figure 1

Screen shot of the data input screen of MatGAT v2.0. Protein or DNA sequences in the FASTA format can be entered
by hand into the data box, uploaded from a text file, or
pasted into place. Several scoring matrices are available for
analyses: BLOSUM50, BLOSUM62, and PAM250. Additionally, "First Gap" and "Gap Extension" conditions may be
altered for optimal alignment. The "Clear" button will delete
the input sequence data and alignments, while leaving the
matrix output unaffected until new data are analyzed.

(Fig. 1). Numerals and spaces are allowed during data
entry of the comment line after the ">", while numbers
and spaces are automatically removed by MatGAT in the
sequence data. Test data files in the FASTA format are
included with the MatGAT archive. The user may specify
which type of alignment matrix (BLOSUM50,
BLOSUM62, and PAM250) to employ with their protein
sequence examination.
Data files of up to 200 DNA or protein sequences have
been analyzed successfully using MatGAT. The DNA
sequences analyzed were 1000–2000 basepairs in size and
took ~90 min to finish a run using a Pentium 3 Processor
on a standard PC. The protein sequences ranged from 300
to 600 amino acids in length and took 12 min to complete
an analysis using the same machine.
The output for MatGAT may be viewed on the computer
screen or printed directly. The results may also be saved as
a text file, or Microsoft Excel delimited file, to be used for
further statistical and phylogenetic analyses. Moreover,
when first booted up MatGAT searches for the presence of
Excel on the user's hard drive. If detected, this information
is saved and output matrices may then be directly transferred to Excel by the click of a single screen button.

Screen output includes clear labels for the names of analyzed sequences (Fig. 2) with data columns of adjustable
width. The identity is encoded in the upper matrix and
similarity in the lower matrix. Clicking the cursor over a
similarity or identity value on the on-screen matrix will
create a pop-up window containing the global alignment
actually employed to obtain that score (Fig. 2). MatGAT
has the ability to output either selected pairwise alignments or all alignments generated into a text file allowing
the researcher to see the basis of the similarity/identity
matrix. MatGAT's Configuration Screen (Fig. 3) allows
alteration of the matrix background and text colors, permitting clear differentiation between values.

matrix contains the identity of the data set and the lower is
the similarity. The inset screen contains a pop-up window
generated by clicking on the sequence pair of interest; this
window displays the pairwise alignment of the tomato and
soybean protein sequences. The "Save All" button saves all
the alignments into a text file, while the "Save Selected" button is enabled once you select one of the alignments for display. This button will selectively save all the alignments that
you have chosen to view.

The colors of data output may be controlled from this
screen, as well as configuration of Excel recognition by
MatGAT.

Error detection routines include detection and stripping
of numbers in DNA and protein data; detection of inappropriate DNA bases other than G, T, C, A, N, and * for
wildcards; discrimination between DNA and amino acid
sequences and indication of the appropriate type of analysis; automatic stripping of spaces from pasted datasets
and prohibition of spaces in data during manual entry;
and, finally evaluation of the number of sequence entries
and error flagging if this value is not greater than one.

PC version of the program requires the presence of a JAVA
run-time environment under the following MS Windows
interfaces: Windows 98, 2000, NT, or XP. The Unix version of the program must also run on a JAVA-enabled
