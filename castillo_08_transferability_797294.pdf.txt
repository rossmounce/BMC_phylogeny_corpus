Abstract
Background: Hordeum chilense, a native South American diploid wild barley, is a potential source
of useful genes for cereal breeding. The use of this wild species to increase genetic variation in
cereals will be greatly facilitated by marker-assisted selection. Different economically feasible
approaches have been undertaken for this wild species with limited direct agricultural use in a
search for suitable and cost-effective markers. The availability of Expressed Sequence Tags (EST)
derived microsatellites or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, commonly called as EST-SSRs,
for barley (Hordeum vulgare) represents a promising source to increase the number of genetic
markers available for the H. chilense genome.
Results: All of the 82 barley EST-derived SSR primer pairs tested for transferability to H. chilense
amplified products of correct size from this species. Of these 82 barley EST-SSRs, 21 (26%) showed
polymorphism among H. chilense lines. Identified polymorphic markers were used to test the
transferability and polymorphism in other Poaceae family species with the aim of establishing H.
chilense phylogenetic relationships. Triticum aestivum-H. chilense addition lines allowed us to
determine the chromosomal localizations of EST-SSR markers and confirm conservation of the
linkage group.
Conclusion: From the present study a set of 21 polymorphic EST-SSR markers have been
identified to be useful for diversity analysis of H. chilense, related wild barleys like H. murinum, and
for wheat marker-assisted introgression breeding. Across-genera transferability of the barley ESTSSR markers has allowed phylogenetic inference within the Triticeae complex.

Background
Wild species constitute a potential source of genetic variation for cultivated species. Besides, they can be analyzed

to answer the long-lasting questions concerning the origins, evolution and spread of major agricultural crops of
the world. Recently, there has been considerable progress

in plant genomics, leading to novel molecular breeding
tools to reduce the costs and to simplify the assays. Plant
genome research has been focused on the major crops and
model species and a vast amount of genomic information
has been accumulated. This information will provide an
opportunity to use it as sources of information for thousands of minor grass species [1].
Hordeum chilense Roem et Schultes is a native South American diploid perennial wild barley (2n = 2x = 14),
included in the section Anisolepsis [2]. It belongs to a heterogeneous group of South American Hordeum species
and it is one of the species of the genus Hordeum with a
high potential for cereal breeding purposes, given its high
crossability with other members of the Triticeae tribe. H.
chilense was used to obtain fertile amphiploids with wheat
of different ploidy levels (diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid). These amphiploids were named Tritordeum and
are the basic genetic material for using H. chilense genetic
variability in wheat breeding [3]. H. chilense has agronomically interesting characteristics, like high carotenoid content, biotic and abiotic stress resistance, and variability for
seed storage proteins [4]. A new cytoplasmic male sterility
(CMS) source in bread wheat using the cytoplasm of H.
chilense has also been reported [5].
The characterization of genetic variability in wild species
like H. chilense and the development of tools to introduce
it into cultivated crops are important plant breeding goals.
The analysis of DNA sequence variation is of major
importance in genetic studies. In this context, molecular
markers are useful tools for assaying genetic variation, and
have greatly enhanced the genetic analysis of crop plants.
High development costs make it impractical to develop
molecular markers directly from wild species like H.
chilense. However, if markers developed in related crop
species can be used, genetic analysis of H. chilense could
be advanced rapidly [6].
Several types of molecular markers, including Random
Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and Sequence
Characterized Amplified Regions (SCARs) [7,8] have been
developed de novo for H. chilense. Comparative genetic
analysis has been established in the grass genomes [9]
showing significant conservation of marker and gene
order across the cereal crops. On this basis, Sequence
Tagged Sites (STSs) and microsatellites or simple sequence
repeats (SSRs) were transferred from wheat and barley to
H. chilense [10,11]. The SSR markers have been the molecular markers of choice for molecular breeders due to their
codominant inheritance, multi-allelic nature and easy
detection [12]. Recent studies have used the increase on
the availability of large numbers of Expressed Sequence
Tags (ESTs) in public databases, to the search for SSRs
present in ESTs i.e. in barley [13], sugarcane [14], bread

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/97

wheat [15], apricot and grape [16], rice [17] and Vaccinium [18].
Across-species transferability of SSRs derived from EST
databases is greater than that of SSRs derived from
enriched genomic DNA libraries, as they originate from
expressed regions and therefore they are more conserved
across a number of related species than non-coding
regions [19]. They have shown to be useful for comparative mapping across species, comparative genomics, and
evolutionary studies and they have been shown to posses
a higher potential for inter-specific transferability than
genomic SSRs [15,16,20-23]. On the other hand, they are
expected to be less polymorphic within the species due to
its conserved nature [19]. In summary, EST-SSR has provided a valuable source of new PCR-based molecular
markers in cereal crops.
We have tested the transferability of 82 EST-SSR markers
developed in barley [24,25], and their potential use as
new molecular tools for introgression, variability and
phylogenetic analysis of the H. chilense genome. The chromosomal locations of the transferred and polymorphic
EST-SSRs were assigned using wheat chromosome addition lines [26].
The grass family (Poaceae) is formed by 600 genera and
between 9,000 to 10,000 species of grasses. This family
comprises the most important cultivated crops like wheat,
barley, rye, and rice [27]. H. chilense belongs to the
Poaceae family, Triticeae tribe, genus Hordeum. Previous
cytogenetic work suggested that H. chilense chromosomes
are more similar to the D- than to the A- or B-genomes of
wheat [28]. The phylogenetic relationships of H. chilense
with respect to Triticum and Hordeum have not been studied in detail so far. For this reason, the set of EST-SSR
primers that successfully amplified H. chilense and
showed polymorphism was further tested for transferability to other species of the Poaceae family with the aim to
investigate phylogenetic relationships.

Methods
Plant material and DNA extraction
Two accessions (H1 and H7) of H. chilense and one genotype ('Barke') of H. vulgare were used for the initial transferability analysis of 82 barley EST-derived SSR-markers.
Barke was included as standard because this cultivar was
used to construct the EST libraries screened to search for
SSRs [29]. A set of wheat (cv. 'Chinese Spring')/H. chilense
accession H1 addition lines [26] and their wheat and wild
barley donors were used for the chromosome location of
the 21 transferred and polymorphic EST-SSR markers. For
the phylogenetic analysis, two hexaploid wheat (Triticum
aestivum L.) accessions ('T21' cv. 'Chinese Spring' and
'T20'), two tetraploid wheat (T. durum) accessions ('T22'

and 'T81' cv. 'Yavaros'), the diploid wheat (T. tauschii)
accession ('T6'), two T. urartu accessions ('T485' and
'T486'), two barley (H. vulgare) cultivars ('Betzes' and
'Barke'), two H. chilense accessions (H1 and H7), one H.
murinum and two Brachypodium distachyon L. accessions
('Bd1' and 'Bd6') were evaluated.
Total genomic DNA was isolated from young frozen leaf
tissue using the CTAB method of Murray and Thompson
[30] as modified by Hernandez et al. [31]. The concentration of each sample was estimated by comparing band
intensity with lambda DNA digests of known concentrations under UV light, after 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining.
Amplification and transferability of barley EST-SSR
markers
A set of 82 barley EST-derived SSR markers developed by
Varshney et al. [25] and uniformly distributed across the
H. vulgare chromosomes were tested for amplification of
the H. chilense DNA from lines H1 and H7 using H. vulgare
cv. 'Barke' as control. For each EST-SSR, the forward
primer was labeled with one fluorescent dye for detection
on an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA, USA). The PCR amplification
was carried out using a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 in 20

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/97

μl reactions consisting of a 1 × PCR buffer including 1.5
μM MgCl2, 200 μM dNTPs, 250 nM of each primer, 0.25
U of Taq Gold DNA polymerase (PCR cycler and reagents
from Applied Biosystems), and 20 ng of genomic DNA.
PCR conditions followed a touch-down protocol as
described in [24] and [25]: an initial denaturing step of 10
min at 94°C was followed by 45 cycles with denaturation
at 94°C for 30 s and extension at 72°C for 30 s, respectively. The annealing temperature was decreased in 0.5°C
per cycle, from 60°C in the first cycle to 55°C after the
10th cycle, and was then kept constant for the remaining
35 cycles (always 30 s). After 45 cycles, a final extension
step was performed at 72°C for 5 min.
Amplification products derived from fluorescently labeled
primers were resolved by capillary electrophoresis on the
ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer. The fragment sizes were
calculated using the computer program GeneScan from
the same manufacturer, by comparison with an internal
size standard (Figure 1). The presence and pattern of stuttering was locus-specific and was analyzed as an indication of correct locus transferability. For instance, Figure 1
shows the amplification of a barley trinucleotide EST-SSR,
with weak -3 bp stutters. The stutters are also present in H.
chilense lines H1 and H7, with a similar pattern (weak -3
bp stutters, as shown in Figure 1). A selection of primer

pairs that showed polymorphism in H. chilense lines were
tested in the other species using the same PCR conditions.
To assign barley EST-SSR markers to H. chilense chromosomes, six T. aestivum/H. chilense accession H1 addition
lines including a monotelodisomic 1HchS addition, a ditelosomic addition for 2Hch alpha arm, and disomic addition lines for chromosomes 4Hch, 5Hch, 6Hch and 7Hch
were used [26] (Figures 2 and 3). The addition line carrying the chromosome 3 is not available and therefore the
assignment of markers to this chromosome was done
using the lack of amplification in the other addition lines
mentioned above.
Phylogenetic data analysis
A binary matrix was generated, where the presence or
absence of each allele was coded by 1 or 0 respectively.
The binary data were used to calculate the distance matrix
using the Jaccard's similarity coefficient [32], because the
binary information was asymmetric (the shared absence
of a given allele did not contribute to genetic similarity, as
no null alleles were found). The software package Phylip
[33] was used to calculate the genetic relationships by
neighbor-joining (NJ) analysis. The reliability and goodness of fit of the dendrogram obtained was tested by bootstrap analysis based on 1,000 permutations, followed by
the program Consense module in the software package
Phylip. The dendrogram (Figure 4) was constructed using
the NJ method with the program TreeView [34]. The tree

was rooted using B. distachyon as outgroup. For the phylogenetic analysis, hexaploid wheat allelic data were separated into its three A, B and D genome alleles, and
tetraploid wheat allelic data were separated into its two A
and B genome alleles (Figure 4). A second dendrogram
(not shown, as the relationships are similar) was obtained
only for the species belonging to the Triticeae tribe, using
the UPGMA clustering method, as the divergence between
these species was quite recent and therefore the molecular
clock could be assumed.

Results
Amplification and polymorphism of barley EST-SSR
markers
All eighty-two sets of primer pairs from barley EST-SSR
markers amplified products within the H. chilense
genome. The amplification patterns of 28 EST-SSRs were
not reliable though. An amplification pattern was considered as not reliable for any of the following four reasons:
i) the presence of too many amplification products; ii) the
presence of faint bands; iii) the molecular weight of the H.
chilense amplification product was of a different size range
than the H. vulgare molecular weight; iv) the H. vulgare
stuttering profile was not maintained in H. chilense. Of the
remaining markers, twenty-one primer pairs (26%)
showed polymorphism between H1 and H7 H. chilense
lines (Figure 1) and were renamed according to their chromosomal location in H. chilense (Table 1). These twentyone primer pairs were tested in the rest of species included
in this study (Table 1). From them, 100% amplified in the
H. murinum genome; 19 (90%) amplified in the T. durum
genome; 17 (81%) amplified the genomes of T. aestivum,
T. urartu and T. tauschii, and 16 (76%) amplified the
genome of B. distachyon. Primers for three EST-SSR markers (M1.4, M4.1 and M5.6) amplified only one of the two
B. distachyon accessions tested. Similarly, amplification of
the primer pair M1.8 was observed only in one of the two
T. urartu and T. durum accessions tested. Primers for 11
EST-SSR markers (M1.2, M2.6, M3.7, M4.1, M4.3, M4.12,
M6.5, M6.7, M6.8, M7.8 and M7.9) were monomorphic
for any individual species. Five primer pairs detected polymorphism within T. aestivum, four within T. durum, four
within T. urartu and six within B. distachyon. All of the 21
primer pairs tested detected interspecies polymorphisms.
Chromosomal location of barley EST-SSR markers in H.
chilense
In order to locate polymorphic barley EST-SSR markers
onto the H. chilense chromosomes, a set of disomic T. aestivum-H. chilense addition lines [26] was used. All the
primer pairs yielded amplification in the expected
homoeologous chromosome (Figures 2 and 3). Amplification products that are present in H. chilense but absent
in wheat, as well as the amplification products of different
size were of particular interest, as these markers can be

wheat genetic background for introgression analysis.
Four out of 21 SSR markers amplified a SSR fragment in
H. chilense, but not in wheat and 15 markers amplified
PCR products of a different size range in H. chilense and
wheat. Therefore, a total of 19 markers were found to be
suitable for the analysis of H. chilense/wheat introgression.

according to their genome constitution. The bootstrap
values are consistent and they are generally higher than
90%. The Triticum species were divided into two groups,
one including the D- and B-genome of wheats, and the
other including the A-genome of wheat. The Hordeum
clade was separated into two clusters: one included the H.
chilense accessions and the other one included H. vulgare
and H. murinum species. B. distachyon was used as outgroup to root the NJ tree. The dendrogram obtained by the
UPGMA clustering method (not shown) generated similar
results to the NJ analysis.

Discussion
Genomic SSRs have been extensively used for mapping,
genetic diversity analysis, and plant breeding, but have a
lower rate of transferability across species when compared
to the EST-SSR markers. Thus, the latter are a better choice
for application in cross-species phylogenetic studies [35],
and are also valuable tools for plant breeding, germplasm
collection conservation [36], and to measure genetic
diversity [37]. More than 500.000 ESTs are presently available for barley and represent an invaluable resource for
the development of SSR markers [24,25]. To systematically exploit potentially useful, albeit less studied wild
species, like H. chilense it would be desirable to use these
EST-SSR markers as anchors to the cultivated species
genome.

A set of barley genomic SSR markers [38] has been previously tested in H. chilense [11]. As expected, the level of
transferability (66%) of barley EST-SSR markers found in
the present work is higher than for the neutral SSRs
(54%). Additionally, the level of polymorphism detected
within H. chilense with the EST-SSRs (26%) is also higher
than with the genomic SSRs (6%).
Our results confirm the high cross-species transferability
of the set of 165 barley EST-SSRs tested in wheat, rye and
rice [13]. Varshney et al. [13] observed 78.2% amplicons
in wheat, 75.2% in rye and 42.4% in rice, demonstrating
the high potential of EST-SSR markers for comparative
mapping among these species. In the present study, we
tested the subset of 21 EST-SSR markers showing higher
level of transferability [13] and polymorphism in H.
chilense lines across genera for phylogenetic inference. We
observed 100% amplification of the selected barley ESTSSR markers in the genome of H. murinum, 90% amplification in the genome of T. durum, 81% amplification in
the genomes of T. aestivum, T. urartu and T. tauschii and
76% amplification in the genome of B. distachyon. Our
results confirm the general observation that the rate of
EST-SSRs transferred across species or genera decays as the
species or genera are more phylogenetically distant [19].
On the other hand, the sensibly higher transfer rate to B.
distachyon than to rice confirms the usefulness of Brachypo-

dium as a model species for barley and wheat and gave us
the species of choice for rooting the phylogenetic tree in
the present study. Our results showed a higher transferability of barley EST-SSRs to H. chilense than to other wild
barley species reported previously [24], where 80% of
examined barley markers were successfully amplified in
wild barley accessions and about 60% of the primers
yielded amplification products in wheat and rye. The high
transferability among Triticeae species and genera has also
been reported for wheat EST-SSR markers. For instance,
Tang et al. [39] tested 243 wheat EST-SSR markers, from
which 216 (88.9%) produced amplicons in wheat, 211
(86.8%) in barley, 187 (77.0%) in rice and 166 (68.3%)
in maize. Zhang et al. [40] reported the transferability of
bread wheat EST-SSRs to closely related Triticeae species,
ranging from 76.7% for A. tauschii to 90.4% for T. durum.
The rates were lower for more distant relatives such as barley (50.4%) or rice (28.3%). Similar results were obtained
by Yu et al. [22], who found that a total of 53% of the
wheat EST-SSR markers produced amplicons in barley.
The location of barley EST-SSR on the H. chilense chromosomes was determined by the amplification of the available wheat addition lines. They were all found in the same
linkage group as barley, thus corroborating the conserved
nature of these markers and their potential use in comparative genomics among species. Conserved chromosome
locations, together with strong selection criteria (including similar molecular weight range to the donor species
and conserved locus stuttering patterns) make these markers' transferability robust enough for their practical application. Fifteen barley EST-SSR produced amplicons of
different size in wheat and H. chilense, and four did not
amplify in wheat. Therefore, 19 barley EST-SSR markers
are useful for wheat-H. chilense introgression analysis.
Wheat EST-SSRs have been recently demonstrated useful
for phylogenetic analysis among the Triticeae species [23].
One of the aims of this study was to infer phylogenetic
relationships among the H. chilense genome, the cultivated barley genome and the wheat genomes using barley
EST-SSRs (Figure 4). In the obtained dendrogram, the
nodes were significantly supported by bootstrap analysis,

In the clade of Triticum species, the hexaploid and tetraploid wheats allelic data were separated into their
genomes. A closer association was observed between the
B- and D-genome and tetraploid species were closely
related to hexaploid species, which is in agreement with a
previous analysis based on wheat EST-SSR data [23].

Conclusion
Our study shows the utility of barley EST-SSR for the
genetic analysis of H. chilense, with a remarkably high
level of polymorphism within this species. It highlights a
reliable and efficient way of obtaining microsatellite
markers for wild relatives of a major crop. The transferred
markers have shown to be useful for phylogenetic studies
among the Triticeae species, and to anchor the H. chilense
genome within the wheat-barley framework using Brachypodium as a root genome. The availability of additional
sets of mapped EST-derived SSR markers for barley and
other Triticeae genomes will assist the development of
molecular maps for H. chilense and its integration into the
genomic network of grass species.

As expected, the H. chilense genome was situated in the
clade of the Hordeum species, despite the reported cytogenetic similarity with the D genome of wheat [1]. The species H. murinum (Xu-genome) was closer to H. vulgare (Igenome) than to H. chilense (H-genome). Several other
studies have also grouped species of the I- and Xugenomes [41], using sequences from three nuclear regions
DMC1, EF-G and ITS; and the vrs1 locus [42].
