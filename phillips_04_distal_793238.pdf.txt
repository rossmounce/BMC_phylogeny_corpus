Abstract
Background: TGM1(transglutaminase 1) is an enzyme that crosslinks the cornified envelope of
mature keratinocytes. Appropriate expression of the TGM1 gene is crucial for proper keratinocyte
function as inactivating mutations lead to the debilitating skin disease, lamellar ichthyosis. TGM1 is
also expressed in squamous metaplasia, a consequence in some epithelia of vitamin A deficiency or
toxic insult that can lead to neoplasia. An understanding of the regulation of this gene in normal
and abnormal differentiation states may contribute to better disease diagnosis and treatment.
Methods: In vivo requirements for expression of the TGM1 gene were studied by fusing various
lengths of promoter DNA to a reporter and injecting the DNA into mouse embryos to generate
transgenic animals. Expression of the reporter was ascertained by Western blotting and
immunohistochemistry. Further delineation of a transcriptionally important distal region was
determined by transfections of progressively shortened or mutated promoter DNA into cultured
keratinocytes.
Results: In vivo analysis of a reporter transgene driven by the TGM1 promoter revealed that 1.6
kilobases, but not 1.1 kilobases, of DNA was sufficient to confer tissue-specific and cell layerspecific expression. This same region was responsible for reporter expression in tissues undergoing
squamous metaplasia as a response to vitamin A deprivation. Mutation of a distal promoter AP1
site or proximal promoter CRE site, both identified as important transcriptional elements in
transfection assays, did not prevent appropriate expression. Further searching for transcriptional
elements using electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA) and transfection assays in cultured
keratinocytes identified two Sp1 elements in a transcriptionally active region between -1.6 and -1.4
kilobases. While mutation of either Sp1 site or the AP1 site singly had only a small effect, mutation
of all three sites eliminated nearly all the transcriptional activity.
Conclusions: A distal region of the TGM1 gene promoter, containing AP1 and Sp1 binding sites,
is evolutionarily conserved and responsible for high level expression in transgenic mice and in
transfected keratinocyte cultures.

Background
Transglutaminases, including the product of the TGM1
gene, catalyze formation of ε-(γ-glutamyl)-lysine
crosslinks in proteins and thereby stabilize biological
structures [1]. In epidermis, TGM1 is required for the formation of the cross-linked envelope. Point mutations in
the gene that cause deficits in enzyme activity can give rise
to lamellar ichthyosis. [2-5], a disease characterized by
lack of a normal barrier to dehydration [6]. Further analysis of the promoter may assist in evaluating cases where
promoter sequence alterations are suspected to yield
defective TGM1 expression [7,8].
TGM1 is normally expressed in the suprabasal cells of
stratifying epithelia such as epidermis, the upper digestive
tract, the female lower genital tract and in the endometrial
epithelium late in pregnancy [9]. It is also expressed as a
result of squamous metaplasia in the trachea induced by
vitamin A deprivation [10] and in a number of epithelial
cell types, including those from bladder and
endometrium, induced by culture on plastic [11]. Transgenes incorporating 2.9 kb of the rabbit [12] or 2.5 kb of
the human [13] TGM1 promoters have been shown to
exhibit appropriate tissue-specific and cell layer-specific
expression in mice. Transfection experiments in cultured
human, rabbit and rat keratinocytes have identified
regions that are important for high transcriptional activity
[12,14,15]. One of two major regions, at -1.5 kb in the distal promoter, contains a consensus AP1 binding site, and
the other region, in the proximal promoter at -0.45 kb,
contains a CRE-like binding site. In this study we assessed
the in vivo activities of these regions of the TGM1 promoter in transgenic mice fed a normal diet and after vitamin A deprivation that induced squamous metaplasia.

Methods
Transgenic mice
The TGM1 promoter/human involucrin reporter fusion
genes used to generate transgenic mice were made by first
cutting the human involucrin genomic clone pλI-3H6B
[16] with HinCII, which cleaves the gene within the second exon at 15 bp 5' to the translation start site. The DNA
was ligated to a Bgl II linker and subsequently cut with Bgl
II and BamH I to excise a 2.5 kb piece of DNA containing
the entire involucrin coding region. This DNA was gel
purified and subcloned into the Bgl II and BamH I sites of
the pGL3 Basic vector (Promega) to generate the reporter
plasmid, pINV, with involucrin coding sequence substituted for luciferase. The TGM1 promoter was amplified
with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) using human TGM1
clone TGI [17] as template and an upstream primer, 5'
base at -2200 (containing an untemplated Sal I restriction
site) and a downstream primer, 3' base at +67 (containing
an untemplated Bgl II restriction site). The promoter PCR
product was completely sequenced to verify that no errors

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-5945/4/2

had been introduced by PCR, then cut with Sal I and Bgl
II and ligated to pINV which had been cut with Xho I and
Bgl II. Transgenes were excised from the plasmid by cutting with Kpn I/Sal I, Spe I/Sal I or Hind III/Sal I to generate TG2.2, TG1.1 and TG0.3, respectively. TG1.6 was
constructed by substituting a sequence verified KpnI/
EcoRV restriction fragment from TG1.6 in pGL3
(described below) for the KpnI/EcoRV fragment of the
TG2.2 transgene. TG2.2/AP1m and TG/2.2CREm with
mutated AP1 and CRE sites, respectively, were made by
subcloning restriction fragments containing the mutations (mutagenesis described in [14]) into TG2.2. The
regions containing the subcloned restriction fragments
were sequence verified. DNA for microinjection was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and Schleicher and
Schuell Elutip columns. Transgenic mice were created
using standard pronuclear injection techniques. Multiple
founders were obtained for each transgene construct and
all resulting progeny were maintained in a purebred FVB
strain. The F1 or later generations were used for analysis.
Animal screening
Presence of the transgene was detected by PCR amplification of a portion of the chimeric sequences from mouse
genomic DNA. The mouse DNA was prepared by a standard method [18]. Briefly, approximately 5 mm of mouse
tail biopsy was digested overnight at 55°C in lysis buffer
(50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM EDTA, 0.125% SDS, 1 mg/
ml proteinase K). Samples were extracted twice with phenol/chloroform (1:1), once with chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. Each sample was reconstituted in 200
µl of 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8) containing 1 mM EDTA
resulting in a final DNA concentration of 50 to 150 ng/µl.
One µl of genomic DNA was used as the template for PCR.
Primers were designed to anneal to the TGM1 promoter at
-0.2 kb (forward primer 5'-GGTGCCAGGGGCCATCACAG) and to the 5' end of the involucrin coding region
(reverse primer 5'-GGCATGGGGGAGGCAGTGG), resulting in a 460 bp product, identified by agarose gel
electrophoresis.
Western blots
Tissues were homogenized in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (20
mM Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS) in a ground
glass homogenizer. After centrifugation for 15 min at
10,000 × g at 4°C, the supernatant was collected and
stored at -80°C. Protein concentration was determined
using Coomassie G-250 (Biorad) [19], and 5 µg of protein
from each tissue were separated by SDS polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis. Proteins were electrophoretically
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a semi-dry
blotter (Biorad). The human involucrin reporter was
detected using rabbit anti-human involucrin antiserum
and ECL Plus chemiluminescence kit (Amersham).

Immunohistochemistry
Mouse tissues were fixed in phosphate buffered saline
containing 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin and sectioned. The sections were incubated with rabbit antihuman involucrin antiserum, followed by biotin-labeled
anti-rabbit antibody, then streptavidin linked to horseradish peroxidase. Sections were stained with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (Biorad) [20] and counter-stained with
hematoxylin. Two to five independent founder lines were
examined for each construct. Use of human involucrin as
a reporter is a departure from the commonly used β-galactosidase, luciferase, or green fluorescent protein. This protein was chosen since very specific antibodies to it are
available [21]. The antiserum recognized the antigen in
fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues, did not cross-react with
the mouse involucrin protein, and reacted with a single
protein in western blotting. Immunohistochemistry
showed that, like endogenous transglutaminase 1 protein
[9], the involucrin reporter is expressed in the suprabasal
layers of the epidermis and increased as the cells moved
toward the surface. The observed staining pattern resembled that of involucrin in human epidermis in that the
cornified layers did not stain well, presumably because
most of the involucrin immunoreactivity was masked by
cross-linking.
Cell culture
The keratinocyte lines used were normal human epidermal cells (hEp) derived from foreskin, the spontaneously
immortalized SIK line, derived from human foreskin epidermis [22], the human squamous cell carcinoma line
SCC9 [23], the rEp line derived from rat epidermis [24],
and the rB line from rat bladder epithelium [11]. Cells
were cultured in the presence of a lethally irradiated 3T3
feeder layer [25] using a 3:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's and Ham's F-12 media, supplemented with
5% fetal bovine serum, 0.4 µg/ml cortisol, 5 µg/ml insulin
and transferrin, 20 pM triiodothyronine and 0.18 mM
adenine [26]. Medium for hEp and SIK cultures was also
supplemented with 10 ng/ml cholera toxin upon inoculation and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor starting at the
first medium change until confluence. All cell lines
express easily detectable levels of TGM1 mRNA on Northern blots ([27] and our unpublished results).
Transfections
Cells were inoculated in 12-well plates and transfected
two to four days later, when the small colonies covered
about 50% of the surface of the wells. SIK, hEp and rEp
cultures were transfected with calcium phosphate-DNA
coprecipitates [28] using 2.5 µg of reporter DNA, 2.5 µg of
sonicated salmon sperm DNA and 1 ng of pRL-cytomegalovirus (Promega) per well. The precipitates were incubated with the cells overnight, then the medium was
changed. Cell extracts were prepared four days later and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-5945/4/2

stored frozen. The rB cell line was transfected using
Fugene reagent (Roche) according to the manufacturer's
protocol with 1.5 µl Fugene reagent, 0.5 µg of reporter
DNA and 10 ng of pRL-cytomegalovirus per well in 1 ml
of serum free DMEM. After 3–4 hours the medium was
replaced with growth medium. After two days, the cells
were harvested.
The reporter DNAs contained pieces of the TGM1 promoter which were amplified by PCR using primers with
added restriction sites at the 5' end, and cloned into the
pGL3 vector (Promega). All terminated at the 3' end at
+67 relative to the transcription start site. Internal deletions were made by fusing PCR products of different
amplified regions of the promoter to a TGM1 minimal
promoter (-90 to +67). Promoters containing mutated
transcription factor binding sites were made using the
Stratagene QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit.
Mutated sites were identified by sequencing and the promoters were excised and subcloned back into the pGL3
vector. Firefly luciferase (driven by the TGM1 promoter)
and Renilla luciferase (used to normalize for differing
transfection efficiencies) were assayed with the dual luciferase kit from Promega.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
Nuclear extracts were prepared by minor modification of
a standard method [29,30]. Probes were made by labeling
annealed oligonucleotides containing a single added 5' G
overhang with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I
(New England Biolabs) in the presence of 32P dCTP (Perkin Elmer) or, for the consensus Sp1 site (Stratagene), by
end-labelling with 32P ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase.
Binding reactions (20 µl) contained 5–10 µg nuclear
extract protein and 500 ng of poly [d(I-C)-poly(dI-C)] in
a solution of 12.5 mM HEPES, pH 7.9 (at 4°C); 0.2 mM
EDTA; 0.01% NP-40; 0.5 mM dithiothreitol; 100 mM
NaCl and 10% glycerol. After a 10 minute incubation at
room temperature, 10 fmol of labeled probe was added
and incubation was continued for 10 minutes. DNA protein complexes were separated on 4% polyacrylamide gels
in 0.5X TBE buffer (final concentrations: 22.5 mM Trisborate, 0.5 mM EDTA). In some experiments competitor
oligonucleotides were added at 100 fold molar excess.
Antibody competition for Sp1 and Sp3 binding was done
by adding 1 or 2 µg of antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-59X or sc644) to binding reactions, followed by incubation on ice
for 1 hr before probe addition.

Results

progressively shortened from the distal (5') end and (2)
the TGM1 promoter with mutated AP1 or CRE binding
sites. A schematic of the different TGM1 transgenes is
shown in Fig 1. The first transgene we studied, TG2.2, contained 2.2 kb of TGM1 promoter DNA, which includes
both the AP1 and CRE regulatory elements that were identified in earlier transfection experiments. TG1.6 eliminates 0.6 kb of DNA, but still includes both of those
elements. Shorter promoters were chosen to eliminate the
AP1 site (TG1.1) or both the AP1 and CRE elements
(TG0.3). TG2.2/CREm and TG2.2/AP1m contain 2.2 kb
of promoter DNA with mutations that have been shown
to destroy the binding activities of the CRE and AP1 sites,
respectively, in electrophoretic mobility shift assays
(EMSA) [14].

TGM1 promoter activity in various tissues from animals
carrying each of the 6 different transgenes was first determined by Western blotting, using the reporter antibody as
a probe. In positive tissues, the reporter was visualized as
a single prominent band, scored as plus (+) in Table 1.
Other tissue extracts showed no reactivity with the antibody, even after extended exposure times, and are scored
as minus (-). We conclude that 1.6 kb of TGM1 promoter
is sufficient to confer tissue specific expression since only
stratified epithelia gave strong positive signals in all of the
TG2.2 and TG1.6 founder lines (10 in total for both constructs). Transgenes with shorter promoters (1.1 and 0.3
kb of DNA) were consistently negative for reporter expression on Western blots of extracts from all tissues examined
(5 of 5 total founders). AP1 and CRE mutations alone did

1Observed immunoreactivites are reported as positive + (strong); +/- (weak), - (negative) for no detectable immunoreactivity, or T (trace) for
barely detectable. These entries are followed by numbers in parentheses which indicate the number of times each tissue was assayed. Results for
each line are the collective outcome of evaluation of tissue extracts derived from 2 or more founders, except for pregnant uterus (one or more).
For variable staining in mutant CRE and AP1 mice, the reported result is for the majority of animals. The number of founder lines obtained for each
construct is given in parentheses beside the construct name (Top line).

not prevent tissue specific expression of the reporter, with
one exception. One of the TG2.2/AP1m founders was negative for reporter expression in all tissues and has been
excluded from the analysis. It is not abnormal to find an
occasional nonexpresser, generally assumed to occur in
these sorts of studies due to repressive effects of chromosomal DNA surrounding the integration site. However,
when the CRE element was mutated some low level
expression was observed in heart and bladder tissue where
TGM1 protein is not normally expressed. It is possible that
additional elements not included in these constructs are
required for complete suppression of ectopic gene activity.
Endometrial epithelium of the uterus has been shown to
express TGM1 late in pregnancy in the rat [9]. This was
also observed for reporter expression in the transgenic
mice. The general promoter regions required for endometrial expression were the same as those required for
expression in stratified squamous epithelia (2.2 and 1.6
kb, but not shorter promoters).
We next examined reporter expression by immunohistochemistry to determine if the promoters employed conferred cell layer appropriate expression. TGM1 is not
normally expressed in basal cells of stratified squamous
epithelia, but appears in the upper spinous and granular
layers. When sections from tissues that were positive for
reporter expression on Western blots were examined by
immunoperoxidase reaction, an intense brown staining
was observed in upper layers, but not in basal cells of epidermis (footpad), oral epithelium (tongue), esophagus,
forestomach or vagina. Fig 2 shows a representative section of footpad epidermis. Tissues or transgenes that were
negative by Western blotting lacked this strong staining
(not shown). The results are fully consistent with the pre-

viously reported tissue and cell layer specific distribution
of transglutaminase 1 in the rat obtained by immunohistochemistry using the monoclonal antibody B.C1 [9]. We
conclude that the same general promoter regions that
confer tissue specificity are also responsible for cell layerspecific expression.
TGM1 promoter in squamous metaplasia
To determine which promoter regions are required for
TGM1 expression in epithelia undergoing squamous
metaplasia, mice were fed a diet lacking vitamin A. Pregnant females were put on the deficient diet and pups were
kept on the diet for 7–8 weeks after weaning. At that time
they began to exhibit ill effects of the diet and were sacrificed and tissues dissected for immunohistochemistry.
Striking pathologies were observed in the uterus in most
animals and in bladder in some animals. In the uterus, in
addition to the normal uniform single layer of endometrial cells, occasional nodules of cells numerous layers
thick were observed throughout the endometrium in vitamin A deficient animals (Fig 3B). These were immunoreactive using antisera to the human involucrin reporter (Fig
3A) and to mouse keratin 5 (not shown) in the TG2.2, 1.6,
2.2/CREm and 2.2/AP1m transgenic mice. Similar nodules were observed in the TG1.1 mice, but reporter staining was absent (not above background levels observed in
stained tissue sections from nontransgenic mice). In several animals, bladder epithelium from deficient animals
with borderline departure from normal histology also
stained for the reporter (Fig 3C). Bladder tissue was
unstained in animals fed standard mouse chow (not
shown). In extreme cases, regions of the bladder epithelium strained strongly where the epithelium was visibly
stratified and desquamated cells were observable (Fig
3D). The proximal urethra also stained intensely in most

deficient animals, but not in animals fed the normal diet
(not shown). Hence, the same promoter regions that conferred reporter expression in normal stratified squamous
epithelia were active in the process of squamous
metaplasia.
Delineating regions of TGM1 distal promoter required for
transcriptional activity
Since the region between -1.6 and -1.1 kb was required for
tissue specific and cell layer (differentiation state) specific

transcriptional activity, it was examined in more detail in
transfection experiments to define further the elements
required for promoter activity. Initially, different regions
of the TGM1 promoter fused to firefly luciferase reporter
were transfected into normal human epidermal cultures
(hEp) and into three different keratinocyte cell lines
(Table 2). The results were qualitatively similar in all four
keratinocyte cultures. Note in particular the importance of
the distal region (-1.0 to -2.2 kb) in all of the cultures. For
further promoter mapping, we chose to use the rB cell line

levels of reporter activity after transfection, and SIK cells.
The latter is a cell line derived from normal human epidermis and nearly equivalent to normal cells, but with
extended lifetime [22]. Fig 4 shows that in cultures of both
rB and SIK, 2.2 kb and 1.6 kb of TGM1 promoter DNA
produced similar levels of expression of the firefly luciferase reporter. Further shortening to 1.5 kb resulted in a
substantial drop in activity in SIK cells (a three-fold

effect). A smaller decrease in activity was observed in rB
cells. A short piece of the proximal promoter (TG 0.09)
had minimal activity. The region between -1.6 and -1.0
was examined more closely by progressively deleting DNA
between -0.09 and -1.6 kb. Deletions between -0.09 and 1.4 resulted in no loss of transcriptional activity in SIK
cells and half the activity in rB cells. In contrast, a further
deletion of 100 bp (TG 1.6-1.5) produced a dramatic

Detection of DNA binding proteins by EMSA
To identify transcription factor binding sites in the transcriptionally important region between -1.5 and -1.4 kb,
we designed overlapping EMSA probes of 25–35 bases
(Fig 5A) and incubated them with nuclear extracts from
SIK cells. After PAGE we observed strong DNA/protein
complexes with probe G (TG -1375 to -1400) (Fig 5B).
Less abundant complexes were formed using probes A

(TG -1487 to -1515) and C (TG -1445 to -1479) (not
shown) and little if any specific binding was observed
with the other probes (not shown). Inspection of the
sequences of probes A and G suggested that the complexes
might contain Sp1 transcription factors. An Sp1 consensus probe (Fig 5B, left side) produced DNA/protein complexes of similar mobilities to those obtained with TG
probes A and G (Fig 5B, right side). Furthermore, the Sp1
consensus oligonucleotide competed as well or better
than self competition with probes A and G. Mutation of 3
or 4 of the Sp1 core consensus G/C base pairs to A/T in

The constructs used for transfection are depicted and described in Fig 4, except that the 3' deletions used in this table extended to -2.2 kb instead
of -1.6 kb. Firefly luciferase activity was divided by the activity of a cotransfected CMV Renilla plasmid to correct for different transfection
efficiencies. To assess only the contribution of upstream sequences, the low amount of activity contributed by the proximal promoter (0.09 kb) was
subtracted, and the result was expressed as the percentage of activity of the TG 2.2 plasmid. The means ± SD of 2–7 independent experiments,
each done in duplicate, are shown. * Values were lower than minimal promoter alone.

both the TG-A and -G oligonucleotides and in the Sp1
consensus oligonucleotide greatly reduced their abilities
to compete. Preincubation with antibody to the Sp1 or
Sp3 transcription factors reduced band intensities when
probed with either TG-A or TG-G (Fig 5C). Preincubation
with both antibodies eliminated most of the binding. A
supershifted band, indicated by an arrow, was also
observed with the Sp3 antibody. An unrelated antibody
did not reduce any of the DNA/protein complexes (not
shown). These results show that Sp1 and Sp3 proteins
account for most of the DNA-binding activity observed
with these two TGM1 promoter Sp1-like sites.
Prediction of transcription factor binding sites by searching for gene sequences conserved across species, an
approach called phylogenetic footprinting [31], has been
developed recently as a tool for analysis of genomes [32].
This method is considered more reliable than searching
for binding sites based on sequence from one species
alone, since many of such identified sites cannot be
shown to be biologically relevant. In addition, many
regions important for transcriptional control occur as
clusters of transcription factor binding sites. Therefore,
sites identified in such clusters are highly likely to be functional. An alignment of four mammalian TGM1 promoters shows that the region between -1.6 and -1.4 is highly
conserved across species compared to surrounding DNA
(Fig 6). An additional file (see Additional File 1,
File1.doc) contains an alignment of the entire 2 kb promoter region. The AP1 site is present in all four gene promoters. Sp1 sites A and G are conserved in human and
rabbit, but not in rat and mouse, although another Sp1
site is located just 5' to site G in those promoters.
Mutational analysis of Sp1-like sites
The contributions of the Sp1-like sites A and G and of the
upstream AP1 site to the transcriptional activity of the 1.6-1.4 region were assessed by mutagenesis and transfec-

tion of the TG 1.6-1.4/pGL3 plasmid (Fig 7; see Fig 4 for
diagram of TGM1 promoter included in this plasmid). In
general, mutation of single sites reduced promoter activity
by about half, with the exception of the TG-A site
mutation in SIK cells which had little effect. Various combinations of two mutated sites further reduced activity by
about half again, retaining about one quarter of the original activity, while the triple mutant retained very little
activity. We conclude that nearly all the transcriptional
activity in this region is attributable to a single AP1 site
and two Sp1-like sites.
Binding of proteins to TGM1 promoter Sp1-like elements
during differentiation in culture
TGM1 RNA transcripts are low in cultures of human keratinocytes before confluence, then increase at confluence,
reaching a plateau by 1 week post-confluence [27,33].
Transcription factors that are important for mediating this
process might follow a similar time course. To determine
the levels of TGM1 promoter Sp1-like binding proteins
during various stages of growth, nuclear extracts were prepared from SCC9 and SIK cultures before confluence, at
confluence and 1 (SCC9 only) and 2 weeks after confluence, then incubated with the Sp1-like probes TG-A and
TG-G for EMSA analysis. Binding activities in extracts
from SCC9 were lower in growing cells, then increased
dramatically at confluence and were maintained thereafter (Fig 8). SIK nuclear extract binding activity increased
more modestly after confluence, particularly noticeable in
the experiment using probe TG-G.

Discussion
Completion of the human genome sequence has generated renewed interest in determining which elements in
the vast stretches of intergenic DNA are important for regulation of transcription. So far this is still not possible to
predict based on sequence alone. Rather, experiments are
required to test the abilities of different regions of gene

Figure activities of keratinocyte nuclear proteins to SP1-like sequences

Binding activities of keratinocyte nuclear proteins to SP1-like sequences A) The sequence of the TGM1 promoter
from -1540 to -1361 kb is shown. The overlapping underlined sequences labelled A-G were chosen as EMSA probes. Both
strands were synthesized and annealed, leaving a single G 5' overhang to allow labelling with 32P dCTP by a fill-in reaction. In
some cases an additional G residue, not present in the gene sequence, was included at the 5' end of one strand. The T and A
residues written above some bases in probes A and G indicate the base changes to make the mutants, TG-Amut and TGGmut. B) Probes were a consensus Sp1 site (Stratagene) or TGM1 promoter Sp1-like sites, TG-A and TG-G. Competitors
were added as indicated or None for no competitor. To make the mutant consensus Sp1 site (Sp1mut), the core sequence
GGGGCGGGG was changed to GGTTTTGGG. Nuclear extracts were from postconfluent SIK cells. C) Antibodies to Sp1,
Sp3 or both were added as indicated to binding reactions with nuclear extracts from postconfluent SIK cells before addition of
probes TG-A or TG-G. The no antibody control is indicated by None. An arrow shows a supershifted band visible after addition of Sp3 antibody.

promoters to regulate transcription appropriately. Common patterns may then emerge to explain such features as
cell-specific expression. Studying the regulation of genes
expressed specifically in keratinocytes has led to the identification of several transcription factors commonly associated with this process [34]. As yet, no predictable
patterns have emerged, necessitating the continued use of
a gene by gene approach for the elucidation of keratinocyte-specific gene regulatory regions.

We have concentrated on regulation of the TGM1 gene in
keratinocyte cultures and in transgenic mice. While our
work was in progress, reports appeared that a 2.5 kb
region upstream of the human TGM1 coding region was
sufficient to confer appropriate expression of a linked
reporter in transgenic mice [13] and a 2.9 kb upstream
region of the rabbit TGM1 gene acted similarly [12]. Our
further studies have narrowed the minimum length of
necessary promoter DNA to between 1.6 and 1.1 kb

Alignment of human, rat, mouse and rabbit TGM1 promoters
Alignment of human, rat, mouse and rabbit TGM1 promoters Sequences were aligned using the ClustalW program.
Sources of DNA sequence are: human, Genbank AF005631, M83120 and our unpublished sequence; rabbit, L10715; rat,
AF309647; mouse, NCBI mouse genome project, chromosome 14 TGM1 gene. Boxes show identified transcription factor
binding sites and * indicates that the nucleotide in that position is conserved in all four species. Numbers refer to distance in
base pairs from the transcription start site of the human gene, assigned as 0.

upstream of the transcription start site. That the required
promoter region is rather short probably reflects the close
proximity of the upstream Rab geranylgeranyl transferase
gene [35,36]. Alignments of human, rabbit, rat and
mouse promoters show several regions that are well conserved. These include regions containing previously identified CRE [12,14] and AP1 [14] sites. Mutation of either
of these sites to sequences shown in vitro to destroy DNA
binding activity did not prevent appropriate expression of
the reporter gene in most of the founder lines harboring
the mutations. This finding suggests that, although these
sites contribute to transcription of the TGM1 gene in
transfection assays with cultured cells [12,14], there must
be compensatory mechanisms for their loss. This is in
contrast to the loss of expression due to mutation of AP1
sites in the loricrin [37] and involucrin [38] gene
promoters. Although some transgenic founder lines harboring the mutated TGM1 promoters exhibited correct
expression patterns, this was not the case for all of the
founder lines and is in contrast to the TG2.2 mice in
which high levels of tissue specific expression were seen in
6 of 6 founder lines. Only 1 of 3 TG2.2AP1mut founder
lines exhibited high levels of reporter expression, leaving
open the possibility that this element contributes to tran-

scriptional efficiency of the promoter. This is difficult to
conclude decisively in transgenic animals due to the contribution of the integration site to transcription levels
even when the copy number inserted is known and rearrangements are not evident. The CRE mutation, on the
other hand, did not appear to affect levels of transcription,
although low levels of ectopic expression were noted in
the mutants. Therefore, that element may have a role in
preventing gene expression in tissues where it is not normally expressed.
TGM1 is expressed normally during the process of squamous differentiation [9,39] and in addition is one of the
markers associated with squamous metaplasia, a process
that occurs in several tissues as a result of pathological
processes, including vitamin A deficiency [10]. Since sites
of metaplasia in regions of toxic insult can progress to
neoplasias (e.g., in the upper airways as a result of smoking), understanding of the metaplastic process may assist
in cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment. In addition
to identifying genes that are induced during squamous
metaplasia, we are now in a position to determine the
transcriptional mechanisms that lead to adoption of the
metaplastic phenotype. As a beginning, we asked whether

Transcriptional activities of SP1 and AP1 mutants
Transcriptional activities of SP1 and AP1 mutants Mutations were introduced into TG 1.6-1.4 by site-directed mutagenesis and assayed by transient transfection into rB (white bars) and SIK (filled bars) cell lines. The promoter with no mutations is designated as TG1.6-1.4; mutant promoters are named according to the sites mutated. Firefly luciferase values were
normalized to the value of a cotransfected pRL-CMV plasmid. To assess only the contribution of the distal promoter, the small
amount of activity contributed by the short piece of the proximal promoter (0.09 to +67) was subtracted, and the data are
expressed as the percentage of the value obtained from the plasmid without mutations (TG1.6-1.4, designated as 100%). Means
and SD of a representative experiment are shown. The experiment was performed 3 times with rB cells and 4 times with SIK
cells.

the same TGM1 promoter elements that drive reporter
expression in normal stratified epithelia of transgenic
mice would be sufficient for expression in metaplastic
tissue as well. The results suggest that the regulation of the
metaplastic process involves use of the same response

elements and perhaps even induction of the same transcription factors that are present in normal stratified tissues. This was not necessarily predictable as the process
might have occurred using different transcription factors
acting at distinct promoter elements.

Figure activities of keratinocyte nuclear extracts as a function of differentiation state
Binding 8
Binding activities of keratinocyte nuclear extracts as a function of differentiation state Keratinocyte nuclear
extracts (NE) were prepared from SCC9 and SIK cultures which were preconfluent (Day -2), confluent (Day 0) or post-confluent (Days 7 and 14). Equal amounts of protein were incubated with TG-A and TG-G probes, and binding activities were determined by EMSA.

The importance of the human TGM1 promoter region
from -1.6 to -1.1 kb for expression in transgenic mice led
us to focus on identifying transcription factors that bind
to this region. This is most easily done by first using transfections of cultured cells, then re-testing more precisely
defined promoters in transgenic mice. The availability of
cell culture models that exhibit many of the features of the
normal differentiation process is essential for this work. In
this case we have primarily used a spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte line (SIK) and a line of keratinocytes derived from rat bladder epithelium (rB). The
latter have the advantage that they are easily transfected
and express high levels of reporter activity. The major conclusions are the same for both cell lines: (1) we have identified a 200 bp region, from -1.6 to -1.4 that is required for
40 to 100% of the activity of the 1.6 kb promoter in rB and
SIK cells, respectively; and (2) mutational analysis
showed that AP1 and Sp1 binding sites account for most
of the transcriptional activity of that region. Some quantitative differences were noted in the effects of certain
deletions and mutations in the two cell lines, e.g. muta-

tion of the TG-A site suppresses activity in rB cells but not
in the SIK line (Fig 7); however, these differences do not
affect our overall conclusions.
AP1 and Sp1 family transcription factor binding sites are
commonly found in keratinocyte-specific genes. Since
members of these transcription factor families are widely
expressed, it is not yet understood how keratinocyte-specific expression is achieved, although it should be noted
that keratinocytes have unusually high levels of both
factors and that overexpression of Sp1 in fibroblasts
reportedly activates expression of a transfected involucrin
promoter [40]. Furthermore, we found that binding of
keratinocyte nuclear proteins to TGM1 Sp1-like binding
sites increased as the cells progressed in their differentiation program with time in culture, as might be expected if
the abundance of these proteins is critical for initiating
TGM1 transcription. This was most dramatic in SCC9
cells, which exhibit a strong induction of differentiation
markers (including TGM1) at confluence ([27] and earlier
work). Our results agree with others who have observed

sustained or increased Sp1/Sp3 binding activity upon differentiation of keratinocytes derived from mouse epidermis, rabbit cornea and the human epidermal-derived
HaCat cell line [41-46]. Specificity of gene expression may
lie in the arrangement of sites or in cooperation with other
as yet unidentified keratinocyte-specific factors. It may be
noteworthy that, although various computer algorithms
for predicting transcription factor binding sites identified
the AP1 and Sp1 sites, other regions of sequence conservation were not identified as binding sites for known factors
and remain to be explored as potential response elements
for keratinocyte-specific factors.
Alignment of TGM1 promoters from four species also
points to the -1.6 to -1.4 kb region as potentially
important for transcriptional regulation since much of the
sequence in that region is conserved. However, an important difference in the location of Sp1 binding sites
between rodents and human and rabbit is evident. The
distal Sp1 site has been eliminated in the rodent lineage
and the location of the proximal site is slightly shifted.
The importance of these differences has yet to be explored,
but may contribute to differences we have seen in some
aspects of regulation of the endogenous TGM1 gene in
human and rat cell lines (BAJ, unpublished data).

Conclusions
The distal region of the TGM1 gene promoter was shown
to be required for appropriate expression of a linked
reporter in transgenic mice both in normal squamous tissues and in squamous metaplasia. A 200 bp region from 1.6 to -1.4 kb upstream of the transcription start site was
determined to be responsible for a majority of the transcriptional activity of the promoter in transfection assays
and is largely conserved in sequence across four mammalian species. This region contains AP1 and Sp1 transcription factor binding sites, and mutation of all three sites
destroys nearly all the transcriptional activity.
