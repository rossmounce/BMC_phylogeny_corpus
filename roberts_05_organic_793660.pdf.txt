Abstract
Microorganisms that adapt to moderate and high salt environments use a variety of solutes, organic
and inorganic, to counter external osmotic pressure. The organic solutes can be zwitterionic,
noncharged, or anionic (along with an inorganic cation such as K+). The range of solutes, their
diverse biosynthetic pathways, and physical properties of the solutes that effect molecular stability
are reviewed.

A dynamic and important property of cells is their ability
to rapidly adapt to changes in external media, for example, increasing NaCl. To adjust to increased external NaCl,
cells in all three kingdoms accumulate a variety of small
molecules in the cytoplasm to counteract the external
osmotic pressure. Inorganic cations (K+ and in some cells
Na+) are often key players in osmotic balance and the
osmotic response. However, the diverse collection of
organic solutes that organisms accumulate in response to
salt stress (also termed osmolytes) is particularly intriguing. Cataloging the occurrence of different molecules and
understanding their biosynthesis and regulation by external osmotic pressure have been active areas of research.
Studies show that the accumulation of solutes has another
role along with osmotic balance. Many osmolytes have
been shown to increase the stability of proteins. They
appear to act as chemical chaperones in cells, and the
mechanism of this stabilization can provide insights into
protein folding. The thermostabilizing role of osmolytes
has also been exploited for various biotechnology purposes. The aim of this review is an examination of the
chemical and biological scope of osmolytes in a wide
range of halotolerant and halophilic organisms with an

overview of experiments that address why these types of
solutes have been naturally selected for osmotic balance.
Also included is a brief summary of the biotechnological
uses of these organic osmolytes.
The types of organic molecules used for osmotic balance
include polyols and derivatives, sugars and derivatives,
amino acids and derivatives, betaines, and ectoines and
occasionally peptides suitably altered to remove charges
[1]. As a general rule of thumb, bacteria and eukaryotes
usually accumulate neutral compatible solutes whereas
archaea prefer negatively charged solutes [2,3]. Interestingly, archaea tend to modify many of the same neutral or
zwitterionic solutes accumulated by eukaryotes or bacteria to make them negatively charged. Osmolytes can
either be synthesized by the cell or transported into the
cell from the medium. A key feature of these molecules is
that they do not inhibit overall cellular functions,
although they may modulate individual enzyme activities. This behavior led to labeling them as 'compatible solutes' [4]. Their accumulation helps to maintain turgor
pressure, cell volume, and concentration of electrolytes –
all important elements for cell proliferation. It is thought

that initial events that trigger osmolyte accumulation
could include ion channels or other transmembrane proteins sensing differences in external and internal salt concentration, cell volume changes, and/or turgor pressure
changes. However, except for transporters, how these
physical changes are translated to increased osmolyte synthesis is not known.

Identification of Osmolytes
Although osmolytes tend to occur at high intracellular
concentrations, they do not have unique chromophores
and were not considered in much detail and in most cases
even identified until high resolution NMR spectroscopy
became a routine analytical method. From the 1970s
onward, a variety of NMR approaches have been used to
identify the organic solutes accumulated by halotolerant
and halophilic organisms. Early natural abundance 13C
NMR studies of cell extracts identified novel solutes, such
as ectoine [5], several β-amino acids [6-8], and di-myoinositol-1,1'-phosphate (DIP), the last associated with
hyperthermophiles [9,10]. More recent methods using 1H
NMR and two-dimensional experiments have significantly increased the sensitivity of solute detection [11]. 1H
NMR methodology can also be used to detect and quantify osmolytes in cell cultures without extraction [12].
Other analytical methods such as HPLC have been used,
often to quantify specific solutes as long as an appropriate
detection method is available. Refractive index detection
is the most general [13], but specific classes of molecules
can be derivatized for rapid and sensitive detection (e.g.,
chromophores added to solutes containing free amino
groups [14]). More recent advances have improved on the
sensitivity of these other assays. For example, the combination of anion-exchange chromatography and pulse
amperometric detection is a very sensitive method that
can detect osmolytes such as ectoine after hydrolytic cleavage of the pyrimidine ring [15]. The methodology is sufficiently sensitive that it can be used to screen colonies on
agar for solutes.
Organic osmolytes fall into three general chemical categories: (i) zwitterionic solutes, (ii) noncharged solutes, and
(iii) anionic solutes. Structures of these molecules and
their occurrence in halotolerant and halophilic microorganisms are presented in Figures 1,2,3,4. Intertwined with
these organic solutes are K+ and Na+ which also contribute
to osmotic balance in cells.
A. Zwitterionic Solutes
Free polar amino acids in cells might be expected to play
a role in osmotic balance. However, neutral amino acids
are not accumulated to high concentrations, presumably
because they are intermediates in protein biosynthesis.
High and varying concentrations of these compounds
could affect diverse cell pathways. Instead, many bacterial

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/1/1/5

and archaeal cells synthesize and accumulate a few zwitterionic molecules derived from amino acids as compatible
solutes. Structures of these solutes and where they are
found are presented in Figure 1.
1. Betaine
This ubiquitous solute, glycine with the primary amine
methylated to form a quaternary amine, is found in halophilic bacteria of diverse phylogenetic affiliation [16]. In
most cells where it is accumulated as an osmolyte, the
betaine is actively transported from complex medium.
Betaine concentrations vary with external NaCl. For example, Imhoff and Rodriguez-Valera [16] showed that for the
eight halophiles examined, the average betaine concentrations in 3, 10 and 20% NaCl (0.51, 1.7 and 3.4 M) were
0.21 ± 0.2, 0.65 ± 0.06, and 0.97 ± 0.09 M. A number of
methanogens have also been observed to accumulate
betaine when grown in rich medium [17]. In contrast to
the large number of bacteria that transport betaine into
the cell for use as an osmolyte, there are only a few bacteria (e.g., Actinopolyspora halophila and Halomonas elongata)
and one methanogen (Methanohalophilus portucalensis
FDF1) that are able to synthesize betaine either by oxidation of choline or methylate of glycine [18-20].
2. Ectoine and hydroxyectoine
Ectoine, a cyclic tetrahydropyrimidine (1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4-pyrimidinecarboxylic acid) can almost be
considered a marker for halophilic bacteria. As shown in
Figure 1, it is synthesized by a wide range of bacteria, both
halotolerant and halophilic varieties. This solute was first
detected in the halophilic, phototrophic Halorhodospora
halochloris [5]. The intracellular ectoine concentration was
shown to increase with increased extracellular NaCl.
Screens of a number of microorganisms have shown that
ectoine is the major osmolyte in aerobic chemoheterotrophic bacteria [1]. It is also the major solute in bacterial
strains isolated from alkaline, hypersaline Mono Lake
[21]. More recently it has also been observed in the moderately halophilic methylotrophic bacteria Methylarcula
marina, M. terricola, and Methylophaga sp. [22,23]. A variant of this solute, hydroxyectoine, has been detected in
halotolerant Sporosarcina pasteurii grown in high osmolarity medium [24].

Growth conditions have been shown to affect the intracellular ectoine pool. For example, in halotolerant Brevibacterium sp., the size of the intracellular ectoine pool
depends not only on the external salt concentration but
on the type of carbon source and aeration level [25].
Ectoine accumulation can also depend on growth stage. In
Chromohalobacter israelensis (formerly Bacterium Ba1),
ectoine only accumulated when the cells were grown in
greater than 0.6 M NaCl, and only in exponentially growing cells [26]. Some microorganisms, e.g., Brevibacterium

useful trait if external salt concentrations decrease. In that
halotolerant organism, ectoine accumulation occurs only
with salt stress, not sugar stress.

The ability to accumulate ectoine can give an organism an
ecological advantage. High-osmolarity-adapted Vibrio
cholerae cells accumulate ectoine and betaine and out
grow non-adapted cells [28]. This has implications for V.

3. Nε-acetyl-β-lysine and β-glutamine
Methanogens have a notably different strategy than many
other organisms in that they accumulate several β-amino

acids for osmotic balance. These solutes provide an excellent strategy for producing a compatible solute since βamino acids are not incorporated into proteins or other
macromolecules. At high external NaCl (>1 M), two zwitterionic β-amino acids have been shown to accumulate in
response to external NaCl. Nε-acetyl-β-lysine has been

detected in a wide range of mesophilic and a few thermophilic methanogens [7,29-31]. β-Glutamine has been
detected in Methanohalophilus species where it is synthesized and accumulated along with Nε-acetyl-β-lysine and
betaine [8]. 13C-pulse/12C-chase and 15N-pulse/14N-dilution NMR experiments can be carried out where cells are
grown in the presence of an NMR-active isotope (typically
13CO or 15NH Cl) for some time. The labeled compound
2
4
is then removed or significantly diluted with unlabeled
material (12CO2 or 14NH4Cl). Loss of the NMR-active isotope then monitors the turnover of these β-amino acid
solute pools in the cells. Both Nε-acetyl-β-lysine and βglutamine exhibit little if any turnover in cells as expected
if these are used only for osmotic balance [30,31].
B. Noncharged solutes
Few molecules that are polar but lack any formal charges
have been identified as osmolytes in halophilic bacteria,
although they are well represented in eukaryotes. For
example, glycerol is prevalent as an osmolyte in marine
and halophilic Dunaliella [32,33]. Glycerol accumulation
is also a characteristic of halotolerant yeast Debaryomyces
hansenii as well as the black yeast Hortea werneckii, and
adaptation of this eukaryotic organism to high NaCl
requires glycerol accumulation [33]. Myo-inositol,
another polyol, is used as an osmolyte in several eukaryotes. Neither of these polar noncharged solutes has been
identified as an osmolyte in bacteria or archaea (or associated with halophiles). However, negatively charged
derivatives of both glycerol and inositol are accumulated
by archaea. The few uncharged solutes that are used by
halotolerant bacteria and archaea include several carbohydrates and an amino acid/dipeptide modified to neutralize all charged groups (Figure 2).

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/1/1/5

15% w/v in cells grown in 24% w/v NaCl [36]. However,
in some cells, its accumulation is preferred at lower NaCl.
For examples, in Chromohalobacter israelensis, trehalose is
only an important solute when the cells are grown with
<0.6 M external NaCl [26]. In the sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio halophilus, trehalose is the major osmolyte. When grown in 15% (2.5 M) NaCl in the absence of
a source of betaine, the cells accumulated 8 µmol trehalose/mg protein and ~2.5 µmol K+/mg protein [37].
Disaccharides without modifications, notably sucrose,
can be transported by some halotolerant and halophilic
organisms, and this can enhance growth in higher NaCl.
Sucrose is synthesized in cyanobacteria and proteobacteria [38,39] where it is usually associated with lower salt
tolerance strains. Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 tolerates up to 1.2 M NaCl. In those cells, the sucrose is a
minor solute (glucosylglycerol is the major osmolyte).
However, the sucrose is critical for stationary phase survival under salt stress conditions [40]. This observation
was rationalized by proposing that the sucrose could regulate metabolic pathways that are active under the nutritional stress conditions of stationary phase [40].
While it is rarely synthesized in bacteria, sucrose is a major
osmoprotectant in plants, and synthesis of sucrose is similar in both cyanobacteria and plants. There are two distinct pathways. In freshwater and marine cyanobacteria,
sucrose is synthesized synthesized from fructose-6-phosphate and a sugar nucleotide (UDP-glucose) in two steps
using sucrose phosphate synthase and sucrose-phosphate
phosphatase [41]. Filamentous cyanobacteria (e.g., Anabaena sp.) use a different pathway, sucrose synthase,
which reversibly converts fructose and ADP-glucose (or
UDP-glucose) to sucrose [42]. Since sucrose-synthesizing
enzymes cannot be identified in other bacteria or archaea,
it is thought that sucrose synthesis in eukaryotes was
acquired by endosymbiotic cyanobacteria that were the
ancestors of chloroplasts [43].

1. Carbohydrates
Few carbohydrates are used for osmotic balance, perhaps
because those with a reducing end are chemically reactive,
and in a sea of proteins these noncharged solutes would
be likely to react with surface amino groups. To avoid this,
the reactive end of the sugar forms a glycosidic bond with
a small neutral molecule, either glycerol or glyceramide.
The neutral derivatized sugars glucosylglycerol and αmannosylglyceramide [34] have been detected in a few
bacteria (Figure 2). α-Glucosylglycerol is accumulated by
a member of the Proteobacteria, Stenotrophomonas [35].
This organism has a large number of potential biotechnology uses (many based on its ability to use uncommon carbon sources), one of which is the production of
glucosylglycerol. α-Mannosylglyceramide is accumulated
in Rhodothermus marinus [34].

2. Uncharged Amino Acids and Peptides
Two solutes in this class have been identified as osmolytes: (i) a carboxamine, and (ii) an acetylated neutral
glutamine dipeptide. In both solutes, modifications mask
the charged α-amino and α-carboxyl groups. N-α-Carbamoyl-L-glutamine 1-amide, an unusual amino acid
derivative, is accumulated by halophilic phototrophic
bacterium Ectothiorhodospira marismortui (also known as
Ectothiorhodospira mobilis) [44]. The dipeptide Nacetylglutaminylglutamine amide is synthesized by several halophilic purple sulfur bacteria [45,46].

The non-reducing glucose disaccharide trehalose is used
by organisms to counteract drying, but it also serves as an
osmolyte. In Actinopolyspora halophila trehalose represents

C. Organic anions
Cells have a negative potential inside and often quite high
intracellular K+. Negatively charged solutes could serve to

Saline Systems 2005, 1:5

balance high intracellular K+ as well as counteract osmotic
pressure. Indeed, at lower external NaCl, many bacteria
(including H. elongata which also synthesizes ectoine) and
archaea use L-α-glutamate as an osmolyte. In methanogens, high NaCl often causes the cells to switch from anionic glutamate isomers to the zwitterionic solute Nεacetyl-β-lysine for osmotic balance [29,31]. Anionic solutes used by bacteria and archaea for osmotic balance can
have a carboxylate supply the negative charge (Table 3) or
contain phosphate or sufate groups (Figure 4).
1. β-Glutamate
Methanogens tend to accumulate β-glutamate as well as
α-glutamate for osmotic balance. 13C-pulse/12C-chase
NMR experiments that monitor solute turnover for α- and
β-glutamate have shown that the α-glutamate pool is
metabolized and replenished while the β-amino acid pool
is relatively static, hence it is an ideal compatible solute
[30,31,47,48]. In Methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus, both the α- and β-glutamate levels increase with
increasing external NaCl [49]. However, there appears to
be a threshold for the glutamates in this organism. The
negatively charged glutamates are accumulated when the
external NaCl is less than 1 M. In that regime, the total
intracellular glutamates occur at concentrations comparable to the intracellular K+. Above 1 M NaCl, zwitterionic
Nε-acetyl-β-lysine becomes the major solute [31,50]. The
accumulation of the zwitterions at high NaCl could indicate that it is now energetically too costly to increase K+
and hence the anionic glutamates that aid in neutralizing
much of the K+ are not needed. In support of this are
observations in M. thermolithotrophicus that within 30 min
of switching cells from 0.67 to 1.4 M NaCl, both K+ and
glutamate concentrations increase transiently then later
decrease as the zwitterion is eventually synthesized [48].

While most studies identifying β-glutamate have concentrated on methanogens, this solute has been detected in a
few bacteria as well. For example, it has been detected in
the Gram-positive organism Nocardiopsis halophila, which
also accumulates the zwitterionic hydroxyectoine [51].
2. β-Hydroxybutyrate and derivatives
Soluble poly-β-hydroxybutyrates, normally used as carbon reservoirs in cells, have been detected in moderate
concentrations in a number of organisms, including Methylarcula marina and Methylarcula terricola [22] and in the
deep sea organism Photobacterium profundum SS9 [52]. The
role of polyhydroxybutyrates in the deep sea bacterium is
particularly intriguing. In P. profundum, betaine and glutamate represent the major solutes when the cells are grown
at 1 atm. However, when grown at 280 atm, β-hydroxybutyrate and polymers of this solute accumulate and become
the major solutes. At a fixed hydrostatic pressure, βhydroxybutyrates also increase with increasing external

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/1/1/5

NaCl (particular at high pressures), indicating that the
monomer and possibly the polymer (although the
enhanced intensity in the NMR resonances for this compound could also indicate increased chain length) function as conventional osmolytes. Because their
intracellular levels respond to hydrostatic as well as
osmotic pressure, these β-hydroxybutyrate solutes in this
organism have been termed 'piezolytes' [52].
3. Anionic polyols and carbohydrates
In bacteria, high intracellular concentrations of negatively
charged carbohydrates are not very common. Two such
solutes that have been detected include α-glucosylglycerate and α-mannosylglycerate. These solutes tie up the
reactive end of the sugar in a glycosidic bond with a
hydroxyl group of glyceric acid. α-Mannosylglycerate,
accumulated by several Rhodothermus spp., is higher in
exponential phase cells and decreases abruptly as cells
enter stationary phase [34]. These cells accumulate both
the anion mannosylglycerate and the neutral α-mannosylglyceramide. Which of these two solutes dominates
depends on stress conditions. Under temperature stress of
the cells, R. marinus is biased towards accumulating mannosylglycerate; increased NaCl favored accumulation of
the neutral α-mannosylglyceramide rather than the
organic anion [34]. Glucosylglycerate has also been
observed in Methanohalophilus portucalensis when those
cells are grown with methanol rather than methylamine
as the substrate for methanogenesis [30]. It is a relatively
minor contributor to osmotic balance under those conditions, but the cells do synthesize it. Its turnover, measured
by NMR, is roughly twice as slow as α-glutamate and 2–4
times faster than turnover of the zwitterions betaine and
Nε-acetyl-β-lysine [30].

Halotolerant archaea (excluding most methanogens) tend
to accumulate organic anions where the negative charge is
often provided by a phosphate moiety and in some cases
by sulfate added to a noncharged solute (Figure 4). Representatives of this class of compounds include the glycerol
derivative α-diglycerol phosphate [53] and a series of myoinositol phosphodiesters based on di-myo-inositol-1,1'phosphate (DIP) [9,10]. Phosphodiesters are better
choices than phosphomonoesters for accumulation at
high concentrations since they will have weaker interactions with cations (particularly divalent cations). DIP and
its relatives (e.g., mannosyl-DIP [54]) are associated with
halotolerant hyperthermophiles. The intracellular concentration of these solutes increases with external NaCl,
but the increase is usually more striking with growth temperatures above 80°C [10,55-57]. In Archaeoglobus fulgidus
grown at 76°C, α-diglycerol phosphate is the major
osmolyte, varying with external NaCl; little if any DIP is
detected. However, at 87°C DIP concentrations are comparable to the α-diglycerol phosphate [58]. The

association of DIP with very high temperatures suggests
that this and related solutes have a role in stabilizing macromolecules to high temperature, although why this odd
sugar is used is not clear. Synthesis of DIP from glucose-6phosphate requires significant energy, so that there must
be a reason for its accumulation.
A few archaea have been seen to accumulate cyclic-2,3diphosphoglycerate, an unusual cyclic pyrophosphate
with a net -3 charge. This solute was first detected in
strains of Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus
[59,60], a thermophilic methanogen that is usually grown
in medium containing low NaCl. In the Marburg strain of
that organism 1,3,4,6-tetracarboxyhexane, a component
of methanofuran, is also a major solute [61]. Cyclic-2,3diphosphoglycerate is also accumulated in Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanopyrus kandleri and Methanothermus
fervidus [58,62]. However, at least in M. thermoautotrophicus it has unusual behavior compared to most osmolytes.
It exhibits very rapid turnover in the cells (compared to
the cell doubling time) and appears to be fixed into a polymer pool from which it can be retrieved in times of stress
[63,64]. Furthermore, its intracellular concentration does
not vary much, even when the cells are grown in 0.4 NaCl
[61]. This behavior could suggest it has a primary role as a
carbon and phosphate storage compound in these
methanogens.
Another unusual anionic solute found in haloalkaliphilic
archaea is sulfotrehalose [65]. This derivative of trehalose
with a sulfate at C2 of one of the glucose rings was the
major solute in several Natronococcus and Natronobacterium species grown in defined media. The intracellular
sulfotrehalose increases with increased external NaCl and
is accumulated in amounts comparable to the intracellular K+ (P. Jablonski, unpublished results). However, the
sulfotrehalose can be replaced by sucrose, in which case
the cells have roughly double the amount of organic solute. Interestingly, sulfatides with sulfotrehalose (modified
tehalose 2'-sulfate with acyl chains on the other glucose
moiety attached to C2 and C3) are synthesized in Mycobacterium tuberculosis [66]. Whether or not such sulfatides
exist in the archaea has not been determined.
D. K+ and other inorganic ions
The high concentration of organic anions in many halophiles requires counterions such as K+ and/or Na+. However, there are halophiles that exclusively use inorganic
ions for osmotic balance. Halophilic aerobic archaea have
been shown to have high K+ and Cl- [67], although absolute amounts appear to depend dramatically on the
method of analysis and/or growth conditions. There are
also bacteria with exceedingly high intracellular K+. In
Salinibacter ruber, an obligatory aerobic chemoorganitrophic and very halophilic bacterium, K+ is the major

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/1/1/5

intracellular component of osmotic balance with 11–15
µmol K+/mg protein [68]. Organic solutes are relatively
low in this organism; these studies used elemental analysis with EM and an X-ray spectrum to describe constituents and flame-photometric determination of K+. S. ruber
occupies a relatively unique position in the bacterial kingdom. Its closest relative, Rhodothermus marinus, uses αmannosylglycerate and α-mannosylglyceramide as osmolytes for osmotic balance [34].
Other microorganisms that do not appear to use organic
osmolytes for balance include anaerobic fementative
members of the families Halobacteroidaceae and Halanaerobiaceae [67-70]. Halobacterium salinarum, an
archaeon, has been reported to accumulate 12 µmol K+/
mg protein. While some organic solutes were observed
(≤50 mM), at those low concentrations they are unlikely
to play a major role in osmotic balance, although they
may aid in charge balance within the cells. Using a cell
volume of 2.75 µl/mg proteins for H. salinarum, the estimated intracellular K+ is 4.4–4.8 M comparable to the Na+
concentration in the medium. Extracting cell pellets prior
to K+ analyses led to considerably lower values (~1 M for
S. ruber and ~3 M for H. salinarum) for K+, suggesting ion
leakage. Intracellular Na+ was also high in the pellet
extracts, which could suggest problems with this type of
analysis. Alternatively, the difference might reflect complexed versus uncomplexed ions. Halophilic sulfatereducing bacteria, e.g., Desulfohalobium retbaense and Desulfovibrio halophilus, like the haloarchea, appear to use
inorganic salts for osmotic balance.
In contrast to the archaeal halophiles, many of the halophilic bacteria do not have exceptional high K+. For example, Halomonas elongata accumulates 1.1 µmol K+/mg
protein when grow with yeast extract and 2.2 µmol/mg
protein when grown in defined medium with glucose as
the sole carbon source. In Halanaerobium acetethylicum
grown in medium with 1.7 M NaCl, the internal cytoplasmic Na+ and Cl- are 0.92 and 1.2 M, respectively, while K+
and Mg2+ concentrations in cells are 0.24 and 0.02 M,
respectively [70].
Although K+ (and occasionally Na+) appears to be the
major intracellular cation, there are reports that, in some
cells, Mg2+ can reach moderately high concentrations.
Heldal and coworkers [71] have found high Mg2+ (close to
0.9 M) in native marine bacteria under conditions of low
dissolved organic carbon. The intracellular Mg2+ was dramatically reduced (<0.2 M) when nutrient levels
increased. They suggested that high intracellular Mg2+ is a
marker of carbon limitation.
Chloride is the most prevalent inorganic anion in halophiles that do not accumulate organic anions. Molar

Saline Systems 2005, 1:5

concentrations of chloride have been detected in several
halophilic archaea. This anion is pumped into cells by
halorhodopsin or cotransported with Na+. While this
anion certainly can contribute to osmotic balance, it
appears to have more critical roles in haloadaptation [72].
For example, chloride has been shown to regulate betaine
transport. Aside from chloride, little is known about the
inorganic anion composition of halophiles. However, a
recent FT-IR study of intact bacteria during growth indicates that in H. salinarum and Halococcus morrhuae, large
changes occur in the concentration of sulfate ion in the
cells [73]. Maximum sulfate occurs during the mid-part of
the exponential phase.
E. Cocktails of organic solutes
One of the things arising from the studies of different
halotolerant and halophilic organisms is that most cells
use an array of solutes, not a single one, for osmotic balance. When a single solute is detected it is often supplied
by the medium and efficiently transported into the cell.
However, left to its own device, the typical bacterial or
archaeal cell synthesizes several molecules that together
contribute to osmotic balance. Sometimes this is a combination of anions and zwitterions, but often several solutes
with the same net charge. Archaea provide particularly
intriguing examples of this strategy, although an explanation for the diversity of solutes in a given organism is
lacking.

Methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus accumulates the
anionic α- and β-glutamate when grown in medium with
less than 1 M NaCl [49]. Cells adapted to higher external
NaCl concentrations switch to accumulating a zwitterions, Nε-acetyl-β-lysine [31,48,50]. Since the glutamate
concentration is roughly the same as intracellular K+, the
switch to accumulating the zwitterions could be the result
of an impaired K+ pump.
Methanohalophilus portucalensis, a halophilic methanogen,
accumulates three zwitterions over its growth range:
betaine, Nε-acetyl-β-lysine, and β-glutamine [8]. α-Glutamate is detected, but its intracellular concentration is relatively low and does not increase with increased external
NaCl. Of the three zwitterions, β-glutamine is only accumulated to large amounts at the high NaCl end of the
growth range. Several conditions can affect the balance
among these three zwitterions [30]. The cells can grow on
trimethylamine or methanol as the substrate for methanogensis, and the substrate with nitrogen promoted accumulation of the two solutes containing two nitrogen
atoms (Nε-acetyl-β-lysine, and β-glutamine). Supplying
precursors of these solutes (glycine, lysine, glutamate) has
little effect on the distribution of the three zwitterions.
Betaine is the only solute that could suppress synthesis of

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/1/1/5

both Nε-acetyl-β-lysine and β-glutamine when it is
present in the medium [74].
Balancing several different anionic osmolytes has also
been observed in the halotolerant, hyperthermophilic
Methanotorris igneus, which accumulates L-α-glutamate, βglutamate, and DIP [10]. Increased external NaCl leads to
preferential increases in the intracellular β-amino acid;
thermal stress causes increases in DIP levels. Multiple anionic solutes are also accumulated in other hyperthermophilic archaea. In Archaeoglobus fulgidus, glutamate,
DIP and α-diglycerol phosphate are used for osmotic balance [53]. In these cells, it is the α-diglycerol phosphate
that was most sensitive to external NaCl while heat
enhanced DIP synthesis and accumulation.

Biosynthesis of Osmolytes – Novel Pathways and
Regulation
A. Betaine
Microorganisms have two different general pathways for
synthesizing betaine (Figure 5). The oxidative pathway
can occur with a single soluble enzyme (choline oxidase
in Gram-positive soil bacteria [75]) or require two distinct
soluble enzymes (choline monooxygenase and betainealdehyde dehydrogenase in higher plants [76]), or it can
occur with a membrane-associated system coded by four
genes in the bet operon (in marine invertebrates and bacteria including Escherichia coli). The last system has been
studied genetically [77], with genes identified for choline
dehydrogenase (betA), betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase
(betB), a choline transporter (betT) and a putative regulator (betI). The choline dehydrogenase catalyzes oxidation
of choline to betaine aldehyde, which is then oxidized to
betaine by the betB gene product. In Pseudomonas, an electron acceptor other than O2 is used for choline oxidation
with suggestions that PQQ is the acceptor [78]. In Actinopolyspora halophila, choline is oxidized to betaine aldehyde
then to betaine [36]. The aldehyde is produced with O2
consumption and H2O2 generation. The final oxidation to
betaine uses reduction of NADP+.

Even organisms that do not accumulate betaine in
response to osmotic stress may have homologues of the
genes for synthesizing this solute. Halomonas elongata does
not appear to accumulate betaine. However, the organism
does have a gene that codes for the oxidation of choline to
betaine [79]. Recently the choline dehydrogenase from
that organism was expressed in E. coli and characterized.
This enzyme can use O2 if no other electron acceptors are
available, although Vmax decreases four-fold compared to
kinetics with an acceptor such as phenazine methosulfate.
Both choline and the betaine-aldehyde are converted to
betaine. Although a glycine box suggestive of FAD+ as a
cofactor was seen in the sequence, there is no experimental evidence for FAD+ as a cofactor. These observations

prompt two questions: (1) what cofactor is used by this
choline dehydrogenase, and (ii) under what conditions is
this gene expressed?
Several microorganisms can also generate betaine by successively methylating glycine. GSMT (glycine sarcosine

methyltransferase) and SDMT (sarcosine dimethylglycine
methyltransferase) in Halorhodospira halochloris and Actinopolyspora halophila transfer the methyl group of S-adenosylmethionine to two different types of amines
[18,36,80]. Betaine synthesis from glycine in a halotolerant photosynthetic organism Aphanothece halophytica was

Saline Systems 2005, 1:5

also carried out by GSMT and DNMT activities [81]. Only
one methanogen, Methanohalophilus portucalensis, has
been shown to synthesize betaine de novo [8]. In these
anaerobic cells, 13C NMR labeling experiments suggest
that betaine is generated by successive methylation of glycine [20]. If cells are grown with 10 mM betaine in the
medium, accumulation of other osmolytes (Nε-acetyl-βlysine, β-glutamine and glucosylglycerate) is suppressed
[74]. However, supplying cells with betaine precursors
does not necessarily alter the distribution of osmolytes.
Exogenous glycine or sarcosine had no effect on betaine
accumulation. Even though the glycine (13C-labeled) was
shown to be internalized by the cells [74], betaine
synthesis and suppression of other osmolytes only occurs
with N, N-dimethylglycine added. This suggests that it is
the N, N-dimethylglycine intracellular concentration that
regulates betaine synthesis and accumulation. Recently a
240 kDa N-methyl transferase has been isolated and partially characterized (M.-C. Lai, C.-C. Wang, M.-J. Chuang,
Y.-C. Wu, and Y.-C. Lee, personal communication). The
source of the methyl groups transferred to glycine is (perhaps not surprisingly) S-adenosylmethionine. While
mammalian activites usually show very specific methyltransferase activity (e.g., glycine N-methyltransferase), an
aggregate of similar mass proteins (but with different pI
values) carries out all three methylation activities in the
methanogen. Different subunits in the aggregate are optimized for different methyl transfers; the K+ concentration
also differentially modulates the methyltransferase activities [[82], M.-C. Lai and coworkers, personal communication]. The last result suggests that betaine accumulation is
likely regulated by the internal K+ concentration in these
cells.
B. Ectoine
The biosynthesis and regulation of ectoine in cells have
been studied in several different bacteria, both Gram-negative and Gram-positive. Biosynthesis of ectoine in H.
elongata has been studied in the greatest detail. The entry
molecule into ectoine biosynthesis is aspartate semialdehyde, which is an intermediate in amino acid metabolism
[83]. A shown in Figure 6, the aldehyde is converted to L2,4-diaminobutyric acid, which is then acetylated to from
Nγ-acetyldiaminobutyric acid (NADA). The final step is
the cyclization of this solute to form ectoine. The genes for
biosynthesis of this solute were identified after the isolation of salt-sensitive mutants led to cloning of genes [84].
Ectoine synthesis is carried out by the products of three
genes: ectABC. The ectA gene codes for diaminobutyric
acid acetyltransferase; ectB codes for the diaminobutyric
acid aminotransferase; ectC codes for ectoine synthase
[19,85]. The three recombinant H. elongata Ect enzymes
have been characterized. The first enzyme (a 260 kDa
complex of 44 kDa subunits) generates the diaminobutyrate by transaminating the aspartate semialdehyde with

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/1/1/5

glutamate. Both pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and K+ are necessary for the diaminobutyrate aminotransferase activity
[86]. The aminotransferase of step two is activated by 0.5
M NaCl (and similarly by KCl). The last enzyme involved,
ectoine synthase, is also activated by NaCl. This suggests
that ectoine accumulation is partially regulated by intracellular cations.
In Chromohalobacter salexigens, the ectABC genes are regulated at the transcriptional level [87]. Osmoregulated promoters with sequence homology to general stress σ factor
have been identified. Since ectoine levels are modulated
with betaine present, there must be additional post-transcriptional control. The effect of betaine on ectABC expression and ectoine accumulation was also shown in
Marinococcus halophilus [88]. In defined medium, the
intracellular level of ectoine increases with NaCl and
suppresses accumulation of trehalose. However, in
complex medium, betaine is accumulated and ectoine
synthesis is suppressed.
In most organisms, it is thought that hydroxyectoine is
synthesized directly from ectoine. However, H. elongata
has an alternate pathway that was observed in strains
defective in EctC. These mutants that can not synthesize
ectoine can still convert NADA directly to hydroxyectoine
[89]. Canovas et al. [89] proposed that NADA is hydroxylated to 3-hydroxyl-Nγ-acetyldiaminobutyrate, which is
then cyclized to hydroxyectoine by 'hydroxyectoine synthase.' The zwitterionic precursor of ectoine can also be
accumulated for osmotic balance. NADA has been
detected in a salt-sensitive strain of H. elongata [89] that
grows optimally with 0.75 to 1.0 M NaCl. It accounts for
80% of the organic solute pool for cells grown in 1.5 M
NaCl) with ectoine (6%) and hydroxyectoine (12%) also
present. NADA confers higher osmotic stability to the cells
than in a H. elongata mutant where diaminobutyrate accumulates [84]. Thus, this solute, but not its diaminobutyrate precursor (which would have a net positive charge)
can act as a compatible solute if ectoine synthesis is
blocked.
C. β-amino acids
Over the past few years, genes have been identified or proteins isolated or cloned that confirm pathways initially
proposed based on 13C isotopic labeling of these solutes.
The pathway originally proposed for biosynthesis of Nεacteyl-β-lysine has two key enzymes: (i) isomerization of
α-lysine to β-lysine catalyzed by a lysine aminomutase,
then (ii) acetylation of the ε-amino group [20,31].
Recently the genes coding for these two enzymes were
identified in Methanosarcina mazei Gö1 [90]: ablA codes
for the aminomutase while ablB codes for the β-lysine
acetyltransferase. Expression of the two genes, which are
organized in an operon, is salt dependent in M. mazei.

Several other methanogens, including Methanococcus
maripaludis, have homologous genes [90]. Deletion of the
abl operon in M. maripaludis generates cells incapable of
growth in high salt medium. It will be interesting to characterize the methanogen lysine aminomutase and to compare it to the catabolic enzyme from bacteria that carries
out the same chemistry.

glutaconyl-CoA, which forms β-glutamyl-CoA when
ammonia is added (although the direct source of ammonia is not clear). Hydrolysis of the CoA ester generates βglutamate. The products of the MJ0800 and MJ0400 genes
have been identified as the enzymes responsible for water
elimination in this pathway by R. H. White and coworkers
(personal communication).

Early NMR evidence ruled out a glutamate aminomutase
activity as a means of generating β-glutamate [31] but did
not identify precursors. As shown in Figure 7, the most
likely pathway (proposed based on enzyme activities
found in Methanocaldococcus jannaschii by M. Graupner,
H. Xu, and R. H. White, personal communication) starts
with the reduction of α-ketoglutarate to α-hydroxyglutarate, which is converted to its coenzyme A ester. Elimination of water from the α-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA generates

While not all the enzymes for synthesizing β-glutamate
have been identified, conversion of β-glutamate to βglutamine is done in Methanohalophilus portucalensis FDF1
by glutamine synthetase [20,91]. That GS has unusual
properties compared to other studied GS enzymes. In particular, its activity with β-glutamate as substrate is much
higher than that of other organisms [91]. Regulation of
the enzyme must occur in the cell, because β-glutamine is
only accumulated to NMR-detectable levels in M.

Although the in vitro Km values for both α- and β-glutamate in this organism appear quite high, there is likely to
be another mechanism responsible for regulation of the
synthesis of this solute by glutamine synthetase and accumulation for osmotic balance.
D. DIP
Data from NMR experiments using 13C-labeled precursors
to label DIP in Methanotorris igneus coupled with in vitro
assays with postulated intermediates [92] led to a pathway
for the biosynthesis of DIP that includes four steps (Figure
8): (i) conversion of D-glucose-6-phosphate to L-inositol1-phosphate (L-I-1-P) via inositol-1-phosphate synthase
(IPS); (ii) hydrolysis of the L-I-1-P by inositol monophoshatase; (iii) coupling of the L-I-1-P with CTP to form
CDP-inositol; and (iv) generation of the phosphodiester
linkage by condensing CDP-inositol with L-I-1-P (via a

'DIP synthase' activity for whom there is yet no candidate
in genomes of organisms that accumulate DIP). In P. woesei, but not in M. igneus, DIP could also be generated from
incubations of crude cell extracts with GTP and I-1-P [93].
This finding can be explained by the same condensation
mechanism, but assuming a multifunctional 'DIP synthase' that catalyzes not only the condensation of CDP-I
and myo-inositol but the dephosphorylation of I-1-P as
well (presumably without releasing the dephosphorylated
product, myo-inositol).
The IPS reaction has been examined in several hyperthermophiles (Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Methanotorris igneus,
Pyrococcus furiosus, P. woesei, and Thermotoga maritima)
known to accumulate this solute (L. Chen and M.F. Roberts, unpublished results). IPS activities in crude extracts
are ubiquitous in these organisms and fall into two
classes: (i) IPS dependent on divalent cations (Mn2+ or

from the other organisms are not activated by metal ions

it is the first step in DIP synthesis, the IPS reaction is
unlikely to be the point where DIP synthesis and accumulation are regulated since many archaea incorporate inosi-

tol into their lipids. If they incorporate L-I-1-P into lipids,
then the second step, the generation of myo-inositol could
be a way to regulate flow of resources into DIP.
The archaeal IMPase enzymes, easily identified by
sequence homology to mammalian IMPases, have unusual properties. They exhibit similar substrate specificity
to eukaryotic IMPases with one curious exception – they
very specifically can dephosphorylate the phosphate on
C1 of fructose bisphosphate [94]. The FBPase activity
identifies this class of enzymes as dual phosphatases that
can process substrates in completely different pathways.
FBPase activity gives it a potential role in gluconeogenesis.
However, a 'true' FBPase with a homologue in all archaeal
genomes was recently purified and cloned [95,96], so that
the IMPase/FBPase in archaea may normally function as
an IMPase, (although, Methanocaldococcus jannaschii does
not accumulate DIP, has no IPS sequence homologue, yet
still has a gene for an IMPase/FBPase homologue which
has been expressed and characterized [97]). Nonetheless,
it is intriguing that an enzyme that could act as either an
IMPase or FBPase under the right circumstances (salt or
temperature stress?) could link carbohydrate synthesis
with responses to stress. At least for the IMPase from A.
fulgidus, there are hints as to what could regulate this
enzyme. This IMPase has two spatially close cysteine residues that can be oxidized to form a disulfide (either by
vigorus bubbling with O2 at 85°C or by adding oxidized
E. coli thioredoxin [98]). Formation of the intramolecular
disulfide inactivates the enzyme; treatment with either a
reducing agent or a reduced thioredoxin can regenerate
active enzyme. Unfortunately, the lack of genetics with A.
fulgidus makes it difficult to see what role this protein does
play in hyperthermophiles. Although enzymes for the
third and fourth steps in DIP production have not been
identified, the last step has been demonstrated with cell
extracts and added CDP-inositol and myo-inositol (L.
Chen and M.F. Roberts, unpublished results). DIP synthesis required the presence of Mg2+.
E. α-Mannosylglycerate (α MG)
The synthesis of this osmolyte has been examined in several hyperthermophiles. There appear to be two distinct
pathways (Figure 9). In R. marinus, there is a direct condensation of GDP-mannose and D-glycerate to form α
MG catalyzed by mannosylglycerate synthase [99]. A second pathway, used by hyperthermophilic archaea, converts GDP-mannose and D-3-phosphoglycerate to
mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate via mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase, followed by phosphoglycerate
phosphatase activity to remove the phosphate group
[100,101].

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/1/1/5

F. Cyclic-2,3-diphosphoglycerate (cDPG)
The biosynthesis of the solute cDPG diverts resources
from gluconeogenesis by phosphorylation of 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PG) with ATP to form 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) via 2-phosphoglycerate kinase [102].
Different transformations involving cDPG production
and hydrolysis are shown in Figure 10. A novel enzyme,
cyclic 2,3-diphosphoglycerate synthetase (cDPGS)
[103,104] then converts DPG to the cyclic form with ATP
hydrolysis driving the reaction. Hydrolysis of cDPG to 3PG would shuttle carbon and phosphate back into gluconeogenesis. In Methanothermus fervidus cDPGS is reversible, although it prefers the direction of cDPG synthesis
[104]. The ability to generate ATP from ADP, inorganic
phosphate Pi) and cDPG under these conditions could
argue for a role in energy storage in that organism. However, in Methanobacter thermoautotrophicus, the K+-activated cDGPS appears irreversible (and membranebound), suggesting it may have a different role [105]. In
soluble cell extracts, hydrolysis of cDPG in the presence of
ADP and Pi could not generate ATP [106]. However, a
membrane bound hydrolase that is inhibited by K+ and Pi
has also been identified [105]. The regulation of cDPG
degradation in M. thermautotrophicus is consistent with it
playing a role as a carbon and phosphate storage compound, although its high concentration in cells clearly
indicates it contributes to osmotic balance.

Transport of Osmolytes
Osmolyte transporters also play important roles in the
osmotic response. Some of these transporters are very
specific and serve to retrieve any solute released by cells.
Others have evolved to scavenge solute or osmolyte precursors so that the more wasteful biosynthetic resources of
the cell are not used. Recent years have witnessed progress
in identifying and characterizing the proteins responsible
for uptake of the osmolytes betaine and ectoine from the
medium. In other cases putative transporter genes have
been identified but no accumulation of the solute is
observed. A summary of the different types of betaine
(and one ectoine) transporters is presented in Table 1.
Another category of membrane proteins involved in
osmolyte movement are the mechanosensitive channels.
These are the major players in responding to hypoosmotic
stress in that they serve as the conduits for solute removal
from the cytoplasm. A recent review on many of the membrane proteins acting as osmosensors can be found in
[107].
A. Betaine
Betaine transport is common to a wide variety of halotolerant and halophilic organisms, both bacteria and
archaea. There are basically two superfamilies of betaine
transporters: (i) secondary transporters that use either the

(ABC) transporters that couple ATP hydrolysis to uptake.
Most organisms that internalize this solute do so via a
member of betaine choline carnitine transporter (BCCT)
family of secondary transporters [108]. The transporter
can be quite specific for betaine as in the moderate
halophilic lactic acid bacterium Tetragenococcus halophilus

[108] or Gram-positive Marinococcus halophilus [109].
Alternatively, the transporters available can internalize a
wider range of solutes. For example, Listeria monocytogenes
internalizes acetylcarnitine, carnitine, γ-butyrobetaine
and 3-dimethylsulfoniopropionate as well as betaine, and
the uptake increases the growth rate [110].
Other secondary transport systems have also been
described. Corynebacterium glutamicum has the usual high

for three other compatible solute uptake systems are
deleted, betaine can still be internalized, although the
uptake is significantly reduced. The gene identified for the

protein (LcoP) resembling a member of the BCCT-family

to use a high affinity transporter [112] that is an ABC

binding domain that hydrolyzes ATP, a membrane

or a periplasmic or extracellular binding protein with a
high affinity for betaine). The ota (osmoprotectant transporter A) gene of Methanosarcina mazei responds to salt
shock [113]. Methanohalophilus portucalensis FDF1 can
transport betaine into the cell as well as synthesize it de
novo [8,82]. The bta gene responsible for betaine transport in this organism is also an ABC-transporter and is
activated by heat as well as salt stress [114]. It is highly
specific for betaine – choline, proline and dimethylglycine, and carnitine could not compete with betaine
uptake. Interestingly, addition of exogenous betaine or its
biosynthetic intermediates induced bta expression immediately. The energy required for synthesis of betaine is 36
ATP whereas only two ATP are required for betaine transport by bta (S.-C. Chen and M.-C. Lai, unpublished
results).
How does betaine finds the transporter? In hyperthermophiles, the high affinity ligand-binding protein ProX
serves to bring the betaine to the transporter. Crystal

[116]

structures of the A. fulgidus ProX in the absence and presence of betaine have identified cation-π interactions and
non-classical hydrogen bonds between protein and ligand
[114]. Similar ligand binding domains have been identified in ORFs in the genomes of other archaea.
B. Ectoine
Ectoine that is provided in the medium can be internalized by some microorganisms. Growth of halotolerant
Brevibacterium sp. JCM 6894 is stimulated by exogenous
ectoine or hydroxyectoine [115]. In H. elongata the
transporter for ectoine and hydroxyectoine (TeaA, TeaB,
TeaC) is similar to members of the tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic transporter family (TRAP-T) [116].
The Ks(ect) is 21.7 µM, indicating a high affinity for external ectoine. The role of this transporter appears to be
recovery of ectoine leaked from the cell. Marinococcus halophilus also can transport external ectoine. In this cell, the
EctM gene product is a BCCT family member [108].

In the same vein, a proteomic analysis of Sinorhizobium
meliloti in media that was supplemented with ectoine

Page 19 of 30

Saline Systems 2005, 1:5

detected increased synthesis of ten proteins, eight of
which were identified by MALDI-TOF analysis of peptides
from the two-dimensional gels [117]. Five of these belong
to the same gene cluster (localized on the pSymB megaplasmid), whose components code for the ATP-binding
cassette transporter ehu (ectoine/hydroxyectoine uptake).
Another cluster of genes (eutABCDE) would produce proteins capable of ectoine catabolism. The net result of
exposing S. meliloti to ectoine is to enhance the production of proteins to internalize and use any of these molecules that escape the cell.
C. Homologues of Transporter Genes
Halobacterium salinarum has two ORFs upstream of transducer genes with significant homology to binding proteins for amino acids and compatible solutes [118].
Deletion mutants indicate that the CoSB/CosT binding/
transducer pair, in which the CosB is a membraneanchored receptor, is critical for chemotaxis towards compatible solutes (in this case betaine). Whether or not the
organism accumulates large amounts of betaine (which
seems not to occur in Halobacterium NRC-1 [119]), this
protein pair could function as a chemotaxis signaling
pathway for organic osmolytes.
D. K+
A variety of K+ channels have been identified in microorganisms. Structures of various K+ channels, initially a
closed, small bacterial channel [120] and more recently a
gated K+-channel (MthK) from Methanobacter thermoautotrophicus [121], have contributed to understanding how
these proteins are arranged in membranes. However,
these K+-channels do not respond to altered osmotic pressure. Rather, different protein complexes appear to
regulate intracellular K+ in response to osmotic stress. H.
elongata uses K+-glutamate as an osmolyte. Recent work
has identified three genes required for K+ uptake: trkA,
trkH, and trkI [122]. The protein expressed by trkA would
be analogous to the cytoplasmic NAD+/NADH binding
protein TrkA in E. coli that is required for K+ uptake by the
Trk system, while the H. elongata TrkH and TrkI are likely
to be transmembrane proteins. Experiments with H.
elongata indicate the TrkI is the main K+-transporter in this
organism. Similar uptake systems may exist in other halophiles as well.
E. Membrane Osmosensors
Cells will swell upon hypoosmotic shock as water rushes
into the cell. To return to the original cell volume, cells
need a rapid means of cytoplasmic solute efflux. All
microorganisms have families of gated transmembrane
channels that open for solute release when the lateral
pressure of the membrane drops below a critical value (for
review see [123]). Mechanosensitive channels (Msc) are
gated by membrane tension and thought to be primary

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/1/1/5

biosensors for osmoregulation in bacteria [124,125].
Their major role appears to be the rapid and non-discriminating release of solutes upon hypoosmotic shock [125].
Msc fall into three classes: MscL, a pentamer with no solute preference that has large conducting activity; MscS, a
heptamer that has smaller conductance, is sensitive to
membrane tension, and can exhibit selectivity for anions
or cations; MscK, likely a heptamer like MscS that is activated by cytoplasmic K+ [123]. These channels are usually
closed but upon changes in membrane tension can open
to allow solute efflux. Other osmosensors include the Volume-activated channels (VAC). These have been suggested to respond to hypoosmotic response as anion
channels [126]. VAC sensors appear to be responsible for
the expulsion of a variety of osmolytes, notably amino
acids and polyols.

Macromolecule Stabilization By Osmolytes –
Theories
Along with balancing external osmotic pressure, compatible solutes have also been shown to stabilize macromolecules. There are many theories regarding protein-solute
interactions. These can be classified into two types: (i)
those that postulate direct solute-macromolecule interactions and (ii) those that hypothesize that macromolecular
stability is mediated by solute-induced changes in water
structure.
A. Solute-Macromolecule Interactions: Preferential Solute
Exclusion andHydration
Osmolytes in high concentrations compete with water
molecules for interactions with protein surfaces. However, it has been proposed that these organic solutes are
preferentially excluded from the surface of proteins [127130]. This in turn leads to preferential hydration of the
protein. The increased osmotic pressure generated by the
solutes should favor compact folded proteins, which
expose less surface area than denatured protein (Figure
11A). The size of internal cavities and internal water
should be reduced as well [131]. Differential interactions
of organic solutes with folded and denatured proteins also
contribute to their stabilization effects. Bolen and
coworkers [132] have proposed that, compared to water,
solutes have more unfavorable interactions with the peptide backbone and since unfolded protein has more available backbone, this biases the equilibrium to a folded
protein (Figure 11B). This would suggest that osmolytes
that impart stability actually interact with the unfolded
state of the protein, shifting the equilibrium to promote
the folded configuration (the 'osmophobic effect' [132]).
The free energy of the denatured state is higher than that
of the native state, making population of this state energetically unfavorable (Figure 11B). Any interactions of
osmolytes with hydrophobic residues of the unfolded

protein do not overcome the osmophobic effect, nor do
they interfere with the hydrophobic effect.
B. Solute-Induced Changes in Water Structure
Ionic solutes will have a pronounced effect on water structure and these interactions will affect macromolecule stability. Neutral salts do not have the same effect on
structure and solubilities of proteins. The Hofmeister
series of ions reflects the ability of different ions to bind
water [133,134]. 'Kosmotropes' (order makers) exhibit a
strong interaction with water, while 'chaotropes' (disorder
makers) exhibit weaker interactions with water than water
has with itself. It is thought that kosmotropes bind water
strongly and aid in preserving the hydration layer around
the macromolecules. These solutes prefer interactions
with water rather than the protein surface, hence preserve
preferential hydration of the protein. Chaotropes can displace water from the protein surface and contribute to
destabilization of structure by dehydrating the macromolecule. Many osmolytes are strikingly similar to the ions of
the Hofmeister series: amino acids resemble ammonium
acetate and the methylamines are functionally similar to
quarternary ammonium ions [135]. Their effects on
proteins should then be similar to those in the Hofmeister
series.

Collins and coworkers have shown that the Hofmeister
series is actually a function of the apparent dynamic
hydration number of the ion [136,137], with the more
hydrated an ion, the greater the stabilization of macromolecules. The calculated hydrated radius for each ion
nicely coincides with the ionic strength. Collins postulated that the effect of an osmolyte on another solute (in
this case the macromolecule) depends on the extent it perturbs the solvation layer of the other solute. If the
osmolyte is tightly hydrated, it cannot as easily interact
with the macromolecule solvation layer, an event that
would destabilize the macromolecule.
Other considerations of water structure and the influence
of solutes on charged regions of macromolecules have
suggested that the water layer at the protein surface is
more dense and reactive than bulk water [138]. Patches of
dense water, along with counterions, would cover charged
surface regions of the protein, while inert zones of lowdensity water would be found around hydrophobic
groups. Macromolecular crowding (see below) would
also influence this. In dilute solutions, changing the density of the bulk water would be energetically unfavorable
because of the large relative volume. When the solution is
concentrated (a cell typically has 2 to 4 g water/g dry
weight [138]), the volume of surface water becomes comparable to the volume of bulk water, allowing density
changes to occur.

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/1/1/5

C. Osmolytes, Excluded Volume, and Pressure Effects
The crowded and inhomogeneous environment of the cell
also contributes to stabilization of folded proteins [139141]. The presence of solutes such as osmolytes,
'macrosolutes' such as cofactors, and other macromolecules aid in stabilizing proteins by decreasing the accessible volume, shifting the equilibrium between the folded
and unfolded state of proteins to favor the more compact
folded state.

This has relevance to pressure stress as well. Increasing
hydrostatic pressure should promote water penetration
from protein surface to the core. With osmolytes that are
bigger than water, this penetration is less likely if critical
water is around the protein and bulk water is diluted with
the osmolyte. Studies of Photobacterium profundum solutes
at 1 and 280 atm are perhaps the best evidence that small
solutes can repel / inhibit water penetration at high hydrostatic pressures [52]. Elevated hydrostatic pressure tends
to denature proteins [142], presumably by enhancing
water penetration into the protein core [143]. In this deep
sea organism, β-hydroxybutyrates accumulate to high
intracellular levels at 280 atm. Perhaps these negatively
charged solutes aid in preventing water penetration, both
with an excluded volume effect but also by altering water
structure in the vicinity of the proteins.
The observation of osmolyte cocktails in different types of
cells likely reflects selection of solutes that cover different
aspects of these effects – destabilization of the denatured
state, retardation of water penetration in protein cores,
and optimal modulation of water density for a particular
cytoplasm. For example, one might expect thermophiles
to have different solutes than mesophiles if solute exclusion is less important than other aspects of osmolyte
effects (perhaps at high temperatures altering water structure is more important). The accumulation of multiple
solutes may be explained by slightly different (and potentially overlapping) effects for each specific solute. For
example, in a cell with multiple zwitterions, perhaps solute size or charge distribution are important in stabilizing
water at some protein surfaces, while for other proteins
preferential exclusion is the dominant effect. In cells with
mixed zwitterions and anions, perhaps the anions are
better excluded by proteins with a net negative charge, but
if the organic anions are balanced by intracellular K+ there
may be a limit on their intracellular concentration and so
zwitterions are also accumulated.

Experimental Effects Of Osmolytes On
Macromolecules
A. Thermoprotection of Proteins
Heat stress often provokes similar responses to salt stress.
Organisms adapt to high external salinity by accumulating osmolytes, and the same solutes accumulated in vivo

Page 22 of 30

Saline Systems 2005, 1:5

can also affect stability of microorganisms to thermal
stress. E. coli cells adapted to grow in high salt contain
increased betaine. Diamant et al. [144] showed that heat
shock of these salt-adapted cells dramatically reduces the
protein aggregation seen in non-adapted cells under the
same stress. This behavior was suggested to result from
osmolyte (specifically betaine, glycerol, proline or trehalose) activation of chaperones GroEL, DnaK, and ClpB.
While such interactions could be shown at low osmolyte
levels, at high osmolyte levels, refolding of proteins was
reduced, possibly because of specific deleterious interactions of the osmolytes with chaperones.
In many cases, these small molecules assist in protein stabilization and/or refolding in vitro. The in vitro studies
with purified enzymes allow one to explore any protective
effects or unusual behavior of novel compatible solutes.
These studies are consistent with the hypothesis that
osmolytes are selected for their unfavorable interactions
with peptide backbones [132].
Rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase has been used to test
the effect of ectoine, hydroxyectroine, and their biosynthetic precursors DA and NADA on thermostability of this
enzyme. At 55°C NADA enhances thermostability as
measured by protection of the enzyme from thermal inactivation [89]. Hydroxyectoine is more effective than
ectoine and NADA at stabilizing proteins to heat stress.
The one real difference with hydroxyectoine is a hydroxyl
group on the ring. Perhaps this further functionalization
of the (now trihydro)pyrimidine ring aids in organizing
water and maintaining high surface tension at high
temperatures.
Ribonuclease has been a popular target for osmolyte stabilization studies. This disulfide crosslinked enzyme can
be reversibly unfolded in the absence of reducing agents.
The effects of some of the more exotic osmolytes have
been examined with this enzyme. 2-O-α-Mannosylglycerate, 0.5 M, increases the mid-point of the thermal denaturation curve, Tm, by 7°C as well as increases the heat
capacity for the protein [145], an effect consistent with the
solute destabilizing the denatured state with respect to
folded protein. Other studies with ribonuclease D show
that a variety of zwitterionic osmolytes dramatically
increase Tm for the protein. As an example, 6 M sarcosine
increases Tm by 24.6° at pH 5 [146]. Crystal structures of
the ribonuclease fail to detect any bound osmolyte or
alterations in water bound to the protein. The data
support the hypothesis that osmolytes stabilize proteins
by perturbing unfolded states, which biases the equilibrium to a compact, folded state.
The charge distribution of an osmolyte can be important
to its biological activity as well. Solutes used by bacteria

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/1/1/5

and archaea have not been examined since the pKa of any
functional groups are well outside accessible pH ranges
for maintaining native proteins. Trimethylamine N-oxide
(TMAO), a common solute in eukaryotes, is zwitterionic
above pH 6 (pKa of 4.66), and it is this state of the molecule that is critical for its stabilization of proteins [147]. At
low pH it no longer acts as a good thermoprotectant.
While this observation may not have physiological relevance, it aids in our understanding of osmolyte properties
important for their biological effects. TMAO has been
shown to decrease the entropy of the unfolded state of
onconase through a solvophobic effect [148]. This solute
clearly diminishes the unfolding rate while having little
effect on the stability of the native protein. For onconase,
TMAO appears to induce a local structural change that
retards unfolding.
The solute exclusion theory would argue for little specificity in osmolyte effects on macromolecules. However,
there are many studies that clearly show preferential stabilization by solutes. Osmolytes can counteract denaturants
such as urea. Potassium D- or L-glutamate (0.25 M) counteracts the effect of urea on glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase
from Escherichia coli by shifting the equilibrium between
the native and molten globule and molten globule to
unfolded protein to a higher urea concentration [149].
However, for this protein other osmolytes (sorbitol,
TMAO, inositol) cannot induce the same shift. A major
conclusion of these studies is that the ability of an osmolyte to counteract urea denaturation depends on specific
osmolyte-protein interactions.
As another example, two archaeal rubredoxins have been
shown to be stabilized to quite different extents by α-diglycerol phosphate [150]. Their structures are similar,
except that one is missing a hairpin loop. There are small
conformational changes induced by α-DGP (or mannosylglycerate) and evidence for solute inducing a more
compact state of the protein, and the occurrence of weak,
specific interactions between osmolyte and protein
surface.
Osmolytes can affect protein conformation and motions
of native structures as well. TMAO induces α-helix formation of alanine-base peptides [151]. Compatible solutes
also attenuate structural fluctuations as measured by
amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange rates [152-154].
Osmolytes certainly inhibit slow, large unfolding transitions, but they can also modulate fast exchange rates as
well [155]. Tryptophan phosphorescence has been used
to probe the flexibility of the native structure of azurin
and a number of mutants [131]. The sugar dampens fluctuations only for loose internally hydrated macromolecules and those with thermally expanded conformations.
The sucrose (and presumably other polyols) will shift the

Page 23 of 30

Saline Systems 2005, 1:5

equilibrium of protein conformations to a more compact
rigid form.
One of the interesting questions is whether or not solutes
in halophiles stabilize proteins in the same manner as for
nonhalophiles. An interesting case in point is the effect of
KCl on the dihydrofolate rductase (DHFR) from Haloferax
volcanii compared to that from E. coli [156]. The protein
from the extreme halophile is much more acidic and one
might think the stabilization effects by K+ would differ
compared to the mesophilic, non-halophilic homologue.
The H. volcanii DHFR requires at least 0.5 M KCl to stay
folded, while the E. coli protein is inactive above 1 M KCl.
Yet the effect of salts on the stability of the proteins to urea
is similar, if one compares stability at the appropriate
physiological ionic strength. This work shows that salts
stabilize the DHFRs by a common mechanism –
preferential hydration and the Hofmeister effect of salt on
the activity and entropy of the aqueous solvent. Although
one could imagine hydrated salt networks occurring in the
halophilic protein leading to halophile-specific stabilization, that is not the case.
B. Interaction with Nucleic Acids
Although most research into how osmolytes affect macromolecular stability has concentrated on proteins/
enzymes, these solutes also affect nucleic acid stability.
The addition of high concentrations of zwitterionic solutes increases the dielectric constant of the solution that,
in turn, decreases ionic interactions and affects the DNA
duplex. Isolated studies have explored the effect of zwitterionic solutes on nucleic acid stability. For example,
betaine has been shown to eliminate the dependence of
dsDNA melting on the base pair composition [157] and
to enhance amplification of GC-rich templates [158] by
lowering the Tm for the template. High concentrations of
compatible solutes also alter accessibility of regions of the
DNA to nucleases. Malin et al. [159] showed that ectoine
and hydroxyectoine alter the DNA conformation such
that endonucleases can no longer cleave it.

Biotechnological Applications Of Osmolytes
The properties of osmolytes make them suitable for a variety of uses in biotechnology as long as one can generate
reasonable quantities either in vivo or in vitro. Induction
of osmolytes in cells can increase protein folding, so that
engineering osmolyte biosynthesis genes in an organism
should improve its salt tolerance. The trick is to couple
osmolyte production to salt stress. For in vitro uses, large
amounts of pure solutes are needed. In many cases, the
solutes can be supplied by 'bacterial milking.' Both
ectoine and hydroxyectoine have been produced in large
quantities using Halomonas elongata [160]. Bacteria in
high NaCl are transferred to low osmolarity medium
where they excrete the now excess solutes. Re-exposure of

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/1/1/5

the bacteria to high salt induces them to re-synthesize the
osmolytes. Repeated transfers between low and high
osmolarity media should dramatically enrich the media
in the osmolytes. Purification of the solutes then relies on
chromatographic steps. This process is the basis of the
German biotechnology company Bitop http://
www.bitop.de/sources/html/e/index.htm that has developed preparative methods for many of the unique osmolytes produced by microorganisms.
A. Chemical Chaperones for Protein Folding
Insoluble or misfolded overexpressed proteins can often
be partially denatured and refolded in the presence of
osmolytes. A specific example is the use of osmolytes to
enhance the yield of folded, functional cytotoxic proteins
directed to the periplasm of E. coli [161]. Cells grown in
4% NaCl with 0.5 M sorbitol and supplemented with 10
mM betaine can accumulate large amounts of the target
protein in the periplasm (this was tried with immunotoxins). Protein is released by freeze-thaw cycles. Both high
osmotic strength and added compatible solutes (in this
case betaine and sorbitol) are necessary for high yields of
protein.

In the same vein, ectoine, betaine, trehalose, and citrulline
have been shown to inhibit insulin amyloid formation in
vitro [162]. This observation may provide directions for
designing small molecules to inhibit myelin formation
associated with neurodegenerative disorders.
B. Enhancing PCR
Several osmolytes (notably betaine, ectoine) have been
shown to be useful in PCR amplification of GC-rich
(72.6% GC) DNA templates with a high Tm. In particular,
ectoine was shown to outperform regular PCR enhancers;
it works by reducing the DNA Tm [163]. Interestingly,
hydroxyectoine increases the Tm of duplex DNA. However,
the optimal solute for these experiments is homoectoine
(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2-methyl-1H-[1,3]-diazepine-4-carnoic acid), a synthetic derivative of ectoine with the ring
expanded by one carbon. For betaine the effective range of
solute is 0.5 to 2.0 M; for ectoine much less (0.25 to 0.5
M) is needed for the same effect. It would be intriguing to
see what effect DIP type solutes have on PCR since they
are synthesized by hyperthermophiles above 80°C.
C. Cryo-protection of microorganisms
Organic osmolytes have also been used as cryo-protectants. In a recent study, the ability of betaine to act as a
cryo-protectant during freezing of diverse bacteria was
examined. Betaine is often much better than two common
cryo-protectant mixtures, serum albumin and trehalose/
dextran, particularly under conditions simulating longterm storage [164]. It is better than the other treatments at
preserving long term viability for microorganisms like

Page 24 of 30

Saline Systems 2005, 1:5

Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Betaine
is as effective as glycerol for liquid nitrogen freezing of
halophilic archaea, and neutrophilic Fe-oxidizing
bacteria.
D. Use in cosmeceuticals and pharmaceuticals
The ability of osmolytes to aid in protecting cells from
diverse stresses has led to the use of at least one of them,
ectoine, in the cosmeceutical industry. Ectoine has been
shown to protect skin from UVA-induced cell damage
[65]. Based on this, RonaCare™ Ectoin, produced by
Merck KgaA, Darmstadt, is presently in use as a moisturizer in cosmetics and skin care products.

Osmolytes have not been developed as reagents in the
pharmaceutical industry, in part because as 'compatible
solutes' they interact minimally with cellular machinery.
However, their ability to stabilize biomolecules may have
some very specific uses. As an example, the German company Bitop in collaboration with researchers at the
Cologne University Clinic is exploring the use of these solutes in certain cancer therapies where they may protect tissues against vascular leak syndrome, a severe side effect of
anti-caner agents.
E. Generation of Stress-Resistant Transgenic Organisms
Insertion of genes for osmolytes into non-halotolerant
organisms should increase their ability to withstand salt
stress. Plants are a good target for these types of experiments since they are often exposed to drought conditions
that would concentrate salt. A few reports of transgenic
plants suggest that eventually this strategy might be useful. Arabidopsis thaliana transformed with a choline oxidase gene (which is needed to synthesize betaine) from
Arthrobacter globiformis has a significantly improved tolerance of salt stress along with improved cold and heat
tolerance [166]. Transgenic tobacco with E. coli betA and
bet B genes has also been constructed. This modified plant
exhibits better salt and cold tolerance [167]. Inserting the
H. elongata ectABC genes also confers hyperosmotic tolerance on cultured tobacco cells [168]. This was shown to
increase the hyperosmotic tolerance of cultured cells,
although only a small amount of ectoine accumulated.
Other recent work to introduce genes for synthesizing
osmolytes in plants [169] as a way to improve stress tolerance has, so far, not led to high accumulation of the
osmolytes. Further developments await a determination
of what limits osmolyte levels in plant cells.

Conclusion
Clearly, there are many different organic solutes used for
osmotic balance in halotolerant and halophilic microorganisms [170]. Except for α-glutamate, the solutes that are
accumulated are not intermediates in biochemical pathways. They are appropriately modified so that they are not

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/1/1/5

chemically reactive even if they occur at high concentrations (i.e., no reactive groups in carbohydrates) and
would have little affinity for the macromolecules that
interact with precursors. In most cases these organic solutes are not metabolized by the cells that accumulate
them. With these properties, they nicely fulfill Brown's
original definition of a compatible solute. However, some
of the more uncommon solutes raise interesting questions. For example, what is it about DIP that makes it a
solute of choice in hyperthermohiles growing above
80°C?
One of the recurrent themes is that most microorganisms
use a cocktail of solutes unless an external solute such as
betaine is provided. One solute may be the major species,
but there are usually several solutes at moderate concentrations in a cell, and the balance among the solutes can
be modulated by growth stage and carbon and nitrogen
substrates. In several of the cases described, there is a
switch from one type of solute to another with increasing
external NaCl. The most common change is from anionic
organic solutes to neutral or zwitterionic solutes (e.g.
glutamates to Nε-acetyl-β-lysine in several methanogens,
α-mannosylglycerate to α-mannosylglyceramide in Rhodothermus marinus). This suggests that internal cation concentrations are intimately linked with the osmolyte pools.
There is also evidence that when challenged with
increased external NaCl, many organisms exhibit an initial response, which in terms of solutes may include K+
internalization and α-glutamate synthesis. The solutes in
this first response are then replaced by a steady-state of
other solutes reflecting the adapted cell osmolyte composition. How the cell coordinates this is an area that certainly needs to be explored.
In the past decade there has been significant progress in
defining biosynthetic pathways and in identifying the
enzyme components for many of these solutes. Ectoine,
betaine, and mannosylglycerate synthesis have been
examined in detail in several cells. Recent work has at least
identified the genes coding for the lysine aminomutase
and acetyltransferase needed for Nε-acetyl-β-lysine biosynthesis, and several of the enzymes along the biosynthetic pathways for β-glutamate and DIP have been
characterized. Yet the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of other solutes (notably the neutral dipeptide and
derivatized amino acid, α-diglycerol phosphate, and sulfotrehalose) have not been explored. In order to understand how external NaCl concentrations are linked to
osmolyte synthesis (or removal) such information is
critical.
Significant work has also been carried out to understand
the thermoprotective features of osmolytes. It has become
clear that solutes can have specific effects on protein

dynamics and appear to limit some types of motions with
the net result of stabilizing folded rather than unfolded
structures. As more examples appear we should have a
better idea of some of the unusual properties of some
osmolytes. For example, modified polyols and carbohydrates are often used by cells that grow at high temperatures as well as high salt. Do these solutes alter solvent
structure in a uniform way? Are they better than other solutes in aiding as chemical chaperones for protein folding/
refolding?
Regardless of the details of osmolyte biosynthesis and
interactions, it is clear that there is a use for these solutes
in the biotechnology arena. Stabilization of proteins or
enhancing PCR is an obvious application of these solutes,
and only the most common solutes have been tried thus
far. One might even improve upon the natural solutes
with synthetic molecules if one has a firm grasp of how
they affect different systems. Some of the more unusual
solutes may have particularly interesting properties that
could be exploited either in vitro or in vivo. Engineering
foreign osmolyte pathways into other cells has not been
very successful but such transgenic organisms will certainly be optimized in the future. It will certainly be interesting to see what new information is provided in the next
5 years or so.
