Abstract
Background: The Australian scincid clade Lerista provides perhaps the best available model for
studying limb reduction in squamates (lizards and snakes), comprising more than 75 species
displaying a remarkable variety of digit configurations, from pentadactyl to entirely limbless
conditions. We investigated the pattern and rate of limb reduction and loss in Lerista, employing a
comprehensive phylogeny inferred from nucleotide sequences for a nuclear intron and six
mitochondrial genes.
Results: The inferred phylogeny reveals extraordinary evolutionary mutability of limb morphology
in Lerista. Ancestral state reconstructions indicate at least ten independent reductions in the
number of digits from a pentadactyl condition, with a further seven reductions proceeding
independently from a tetradactyl condition derived from one of these reductions. Four
independent losses of all digits are inferred, three from pentadactyl or tetradactyl conditions. These
conclusions are not substantially affected by uncertainty in assumed rates of character state
transition or the phylogeny. An estimated age of 13.4 million years for Lerista entails that limb
reduction has occurred not only repeatedly, but also very rapidly. At the highest rate, complete
loss of digits from a pentadactyl condition is estimated to have occurred within 3.6 million years.
Conclusion: The exceptionally high frequency and rate of limb reduction inferred for Lerista
emphasise the potential for rapid and substantial alteration of body form in squamates. An absence
of compelling evidence for reversals of digit loss contrasts with a recent proposal that digits have
been regained in some species of the gymnophthalmid clade Bachia, possibly reflecting an influence
of differing environmental and genetic contexts on the evolution of limb morphology in these
clades. Future study of the genetic, developmental, and ecological bases of limb reduction and loss
in Lerista promises the elucidation of not only this phenomenon in squamates, but also the dramatic
evolutionary transformations of body form that have produced the extraordinary diversity of
multicellular organisms.

Background
Limb reduction has occurred repeatedly during tetrapod
evolution, affecting several morphologically and ecologi-

cally disparate clades (e.g., Aves, Lissamphibia, Mammalia, Squamata) [1,2]. Among these clades, Squamata
(lizards and snakes) is regarded generally as an exemplary

model for studying modes and causes of this potentially
dramatic evolutionary phenomenon (e.g., [1-3]). At least
53 squamate lineages have been identified as having independently lost one or more bones of the fore- or hindlimb
[3]. Many of these lineages are closely related and, accordingly, offer excellent material for comparative study. More
significantly, a number of squamate clades include extant
species displaying a range of intermediate states between
pentadactyl and limbless conditions, affording the possibility of reconstructing patterns and rates of limb reduction and loss. Aside from their potential for elucidating
the mechanisms and causes of limb reduction itself, such
inferences of patterns and rates may contribute to an
improved understanding of the substantial transformations of body form accompanying the emergence of
higher taxa and, concomitantly, the relationship of
macro- and microevolutionary phenomena (e.g., [4,5]).
Previous studies have examined several aspects of limb
reduction in squamates. Wiens and Slingluff [4] presented
an explicitly phylogenetic analysis of limb reduction and
associated body elongation in the morphologically
diverse clade Anguidae. Ancestral character state reconstructions provided evidence for three independent transitions to an elongate, functionally limbless body form,
each of which was inferred to have occurred gradually
over a period of more than 20 million years. Shapiro [6]
and Shapiro et al. [7] demonstrated that digit loss in the
scincid clade Hemiergis is not explained by simple truncation of a putative ancestral (i.e., pentadactyl) developmental program. Instead, structurally reduced limbs
exhibit abbreviated embryonic expression of the gene
sonic hedgehog and a presumably related decrease in the
proliferation of limb mesenchyme. Wiens et al. [8] considered the roles of biogeography and competition in determining the frequency of transitions to an elongate, limbreduced body form across squamates, proposing that discontinuity of habitats, dispersal limitation, and interspecific competition may be as significant as functional and
developmental constraints in explaining the number of
times such transitions have occurred. Kohlsdorf and Wagner [9] used phylogenetic methods to examine the evolution of limb morphology in the gymnophthalmid clade
Bachia. Their analyses indicated that digits have been
regained in some species of this clade and, accordingly,
that the ability to develop digits may be preserved for an
extended period after their loss. This conclusion challenges the traditional perspective that limb reduction is
irreversible, and emphasises the need for further study of
additional squamate clades to evaluate the generality of
the above results.
Most recently, Brandley et al. [5] employed a time-calibrated phylogeny for 258 species to examine patterns in
the evolution of an elongate, limbless body form across

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/310

squamates. Their analyses revealed a consistent association of decreases in limb length, digit loss, and body elongation across ecologically and phylogenetically diverse
squamate clades, indicating an influence of shared functional and developmental constraints on the evolution of
body form. Transitions to a highly elongate, limbless
body plan were estimated to have occurred over periods as
brief as 16 million years, although intermediate morphologies (i.e., partial limb reduction, moderate body elongation) were inferred to persist for considerably greater
lengths of time in some instances. This result intimates
that such intermediate morphologies may be evolutionarily stable and, accordingly, are not necessarily transitory
stages in an incomplete process of body elongation and
limb loss. Although confirming the pervasiveness of structural reduction in the evolution of squamate limb morphology (at least 70 cases of digit loss were inferred),
Brandley et al.'s [5] analyses identified at least six
instances in which digits have been reacquired, supporting Kohlsdorf and Wagner's (2006) conclusion that limb
reduction may be reversible.
While Brandley et al.'s [5] study is notable for its broad
phylogenetic scope, the relatively sparse taxon sampling
for several clades dictated (at least presently) by such an
inclusive analysis potentially limits the resolution that can
be attained in inferring the mode and tempo of evolutionary transitions. As Brandley et al. [5] note, denser taxon
sampling may reveal that substantial limb reduction is
possible over intervals considerably shorter than those
indicated by their analyses. Similarly, inferred frequencies
of digit loss and gain may be significantly altered by the
inclusion of additional species; that Brandley et al.'s [5]
analyses, which include only three of the 15 species considered by Kohlsdorf and Wagner [9], provide no evidence
for reversals of limb reduction in Bachia serves to illustrate
this point. Accordingly, detailed studies of comparatively
recent clades are needed to establish general patterns and
rates of squamate limb reduction and loss. A primary concern is whether the pattern indicated by analyses such as
those of Wiens and Slingluff [4] and Brandley et al. [5],
specifically, moderately frequent limb loss occurring over
extended intervals (usually tens of millions of years) with
occasional re-elaboration of limbs, accurately represents
the evolution of body form in squamates. If analyses of
more recent clades (which are less susceptible to sampling
artefacts due to extinction) indicate consistently higher
frequencies and rates of limb loss (or re-elaboration),
there may be cause to query the perspective offered by
these broader-scale studies. A number of diverse genera
composed of species exhibiting varying degrees of limb
reduction constitute ideal candidates for such analyses.
The Australian scincid clade Lerista is pre-eminent among
these, comprising more than 75 species displaying at least
20 distinct limb bone configurations, from that consid-

ered plesiomorphic for squamates (pentadactyl, with
phalangeal formulae of 2.3.4.5.3 and 2.3.4.5.4 for the
manus and pes, respectively) to entirely limbless [10,11].

limbs are greatly reduced (carpentariae, cinerea, humphriesi,
karlschmidti, praepedita, stylis, wilkinsi) or absent (ameles,
apoda) similarly are polyphyletic.

Although Lerista has been considered the best available
model for investigating squamate limb reduction [10,11],
lack of a well-resolved phylogeny has impeded study of
the pattern and mode of limb reduction and loss within
the clade. Greer [10,11], who examined intra- and interspecific variation in phalangeal configurations for more
than half of the species of Lerista then described, relied on
an arrangement of observed configurations entailing the
minimum amount of change between each in reconstructing sequences of phalanx loss, while noting that 'it would
be most desirable to be able to order variation on the basis
of a hypothesis of intrageneric relationships for Lerista
based on characters independent of those under study,
but unfortunately, this is not yet possible' [10]. More than
two decades later, the phylogeny of Lerista remains largely
obscure. A modest number of species groups have been
diagnosed explicitly on the basis of proposed apomorphic
character states, implying monophyly [12-14], however,
relationships within and among these species groups are
unknown. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive phylogeny for Lerista, inferred from nucleotide
sequences for a nuclear intron and six mitochondrial
genes. This phylogeny is employed in reconstructing
ancestral digit configurations, which, in conjunction with
estimates of absolute ages for nodes, provide insight into
the pattern and rate of limb reduction within the clade.

To investigate the pattern and rate of limb reduction
within Lerista, we reconstructed numbers of digits for
internal nodes assuming a Markov model of character
evolution with separate parameters describing instantaneous rates of digit gain and loss. The number of digits for
the manus and pes were considered independently. For
the manus, the ratio of maximum likelihood rates of digit
gain and loss (9.524 × 10-5) indicates that increases in the
number of digits are far less probable than reductions.
Maximum likelihood reconstructions of ancestral states
imply 19 instances of digit loss with no reversals to an
increased number of digits (Figure 1). All rates of digit
gain not significantly less likely than the maximum likelihood estimate yield maximum likelihood ancestral states
identical to or only insignificantly more likely than those
reconstructed assuming the maximum likelihood rate (in
comparing maximum likelihood and alternative states,
log-likelihood differences of no more than two units were
considered insignificant; see Methods).

Results and Discussion
Phylogenetic relationships were inferred from ATP synthetase-β subunit intron, 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, and ND4
and adjacent tRNA-His, tRNA-Ser, and tRNA-Leu nucleotide sequences (2859 aligned sites) for 72 species of Lerista (c. 90% of those presently recognised) and three
outgroup taxa (Ctenotus robustus, Eulamprus kosciuskoi, and
Glaphyromorphus fuscicaudis). A majority-rule consensus of
trees sampled in a Bayesian analysis of the combined
sequence data (Figure 1) includes many significantly-supported clades (those associated with a posterior probability > 0.95). Several of these clades correspond with
putative monophyletic groups recognised previously on
the basis of morphology, including the bipes species group
[13], the nichollsi species group (including lineopunctulata;
see [13]), and the orientalis species group (excluding muelleri; see [14]). However, the majority of recovered relationships have never been hypothesised by earlier authors
(e.g., the sister group relationship of apoda and the bipes
species group, and of praepedita + humphriesi and the
nichollsi species group). The four species with well-developed, pentadactyl limbs (arenicola, bougainvillii, microtis,
viduata) compose two distant clades, neither of which is
positioned basally within Lerista. Those species in which

For the pes, the estimated rate of digit gain exceeds that of
digit loss (ratio of rates of gain and loss 2.056), with maximum likelihood reconstructions of ancestral states indicating 18 increases in the number of digits and 8
reductions (see Additional file 1). Although suggesting
several reversals of limb reduction in Lerista, we regard
this result as equivocal for two reasons. Firstly, a range of
rates of digit gain for the pes are nearly as likely as the
maximum likelihood estimate (0.394), and some of these
rates yield ancestral state reconstructions implying no
increases in the number of digits. Specifically, rates of
0.020–0.025 are not significantly less likely than the maximum likelihood rate and yield maximum likelihood
ancestral states indicating 25 cases of digit loss but no
instances in which digits are gained (Figure 1). Secondly,
when considered in conjunction with states inferred for
the manus, reconstructions of numbers of pedal digits
(i.e., for the maximum likelihood rate of digit gain) imply
implausible digit configurations for many internal nodes.
In particular, configurations of either five or four digits for
the manus and two digits for the pes are implied for the
majority of basal nodes, however, neither is represented
among extant species of Lerista (which never exhibit fewer
digits for the pes than the manus [10,11]). Ancestral states
reconstructed assuming rates of digit gain of 0.020–0.025,
by contrast, imply implausible digit configurations for
very few internal nodes. Moreover, in all instances, the
ancestral states implying implausible digit configurations
are not significantly more likely than alternative states
implying configurations observed among extant species of
Lerista (see Figure 1; this is not the case for ancestral states

of digits for the manus and pes are shown adjacent to internal nodes. Ancestral states for the manus were reconstructed
assuming maximum likelihood rates of digit gain and loss; for the pes, ancestral states are those inferred assuming the maximum likelihood rate of digit loss and rates of digit gain of 0.020–0.025 (see text). Alternative numbers of pedal digits yielding a

inferred under the maximum likelihood rate of digit
gain). Thus, we are disinclined to conclude that limb
reduction has been reversed in Lerista, preferring the
ancestral states reconstructed assuming rates of pedal digit
gain of 0.020–0.025 (however, see caveat below).
An examination of ancestral state reconstructions across
1000 trees (every fifth of 5000 trees) sampled after attaining stationarity in the Bayesian analysis indicates that the
above conclusions are largely insensitive to uncertainty in
the inferred phylogeny. For all nodes, maximum likelihood numbers of manual digits reconstructed for more
than 90% of trees are consistent with (i.e., identical to or
only insignificantly more likely than) those inferred
assuming the Bayesian majority-rule consensus (see Figure 1), and reversals of limb reduction are inferred for
only an insignificant proportion (less than 5%) of trees.
Similar results are obtained when rates of digit gain considerably higher than those estimated by maximum likelihood are assumed. For example, a rate of 0.42, although
significantly less likely than the (nearly invariably lower)
maximum likelihood rates for 90% of trees, yields maximum likelihood ancestral states for 69 of 74 internal
nodes consistent with those reconstructed assuming the
Bayesian majority-rule consensus in more than 92% of
trees, with more than 62% of trees exhibiting no reversals
of limb reduction (note that branch lengths for post-stationarity trees are unscaled, so that rates are not immediately comparable to those for the Bayesian majority-rule
consensus in Figure 1, in which branch lengths have been
modified via penalised likelihood rate smoothing to produce an ultrametric tree; see Methods). Thus, the inferred
ancestral states for the manus in Figure 1 are not substantially affected by uncertainty in tree topology, branch
lengths, and rates of character state transition.
Ancestral state reconstructions for the pes are similarly stable when uncertainty in the phylogeny is considered.
Assuming estimated rates of digit gain, maximum likelihood numbers of pedal digits for all nodes are consistent
with those for the Bayesian majority-rule consensus (see
Additional file 1) in more than 90% of trees. As for the
Bayesian majority-rule consensus (see above), ancestral
state reconstructions for nearly all trees (more than 95%)
imply one or more instances of reversed limb reduction.
Nonetheless, a range of rates of pedal digit gain only insignificantly lower than those estimated for a considerable
proportion of trees yield ancestral state reconstructions
very similar to those obtained for the Bayesian majorityrule consensus assuming rates of digit gain of 0.020–
0.025 (entailing no increases in the number of digits; see
Figure 1). A rate of 0.16, for example, is not significantly
less likely than the estimated rates for 64% of trees and,
for all except a single node, yields maximum likelihood
ancestral states for more than 97% of trees that are con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/310

sistent with the preferred ancestral states in Figure 1. In
almost all cases, numbers of pedal digits reconstructed for
the single exceptional node (the most recent shared ancestor of christinae, distinguenda, elegans, lineata, and planiventralis) entail no increases in the number of digits, and
reversed limb reduction is implied in less than 5% of
trees.
The phylogeny in Figure 1 thus implies extraordinary evolutionary mutability of limb morphology in Lerista.
Although this conclusion does not depend on a preference for a specific set of ancestral states, the alternative
reconstructions for the pes presented in Figure 1 and
Additional file 1 evidently entail disparate patterns of
limb evolution (repeated digit loss versus pervasive reacquisition of digits). As discussed above, there is no cogent
statistical basis for favouring either of these reconstructions; ancestral states inferred assuming the maximum
likelihood rate of digit gain (implying many reversals of
limb reduction) are only insignificantly more likely than
those reconstructed assuming rates of digit gain of 0.020–
0.025 (entailing no reversals). However, when the very
robust ancestral states for the manus are considered, a
compelling argument can be made for accepting reconstructions for the pes implying no reversals of limb reduction. Whereas ancestral states entailing repeated reelaboration of the pes imply digit configurations for many
internal nodes differing fundamentally from those displayed by extant species of Lerista, ancestral digit configurations implied by reconstructions entailing no reversals
of pedal digit loss are nearly invariably represented
among observed phenotypes.
Although we prefer ancestral state reconstructions for the
pes implying repeated, unreversed digit loss, we acknowledge that our results could be considered to indicate the
reacquisition of pedal digits, and so provide further evidence for Kohlsdorf and Wagner's [9] proposal that limb
reduction is potentially reversible. Perhaps significantly,
the inferred age of Lerista (see below) is comparable to
estimates of the period over which unexpressed developmental genes may preserve their functionality (0.5–6 million years [15]), rendering the re-elaboration of
structurally reduced limbs at least plausible. Nonetheless,
it should be noted that such re-elaboration would entail
two instances in which a highly reduced pes (having two
digits) has regained an entire or nearly entire complement
of phalanges (microtis and bougainvillii exhibit phalangeal
complements for the pes of 2.3.4.5.4 and 2.3.4.5.3,
respectively). This contrasts with the inferred cases of digit
reacquisition in Bachia, where species having putatively
re-evolved digits exhibit unusual phalangeal complements (0.2.2.2.2 and 2.2.2.2.0 for the manus and pes,
respectively), possibly reflecting the activation of a novel
(i.e., non-ancestral) developmental pathway (Kohlsdorf

and Wagner regarded this as additional evidence for the
re-elaboration of limbs).
Allowing that pedal digit loss has not been reversed in Lerista, our analyses indicate a remarkably high frequency of
limb reduction. Ancestral states reconstructed assuming
the Bayesian majority-rule consensus, rates of digit gain of
0.020–0.025 for the pes, and maximum likelihood estimates for all other rates imply 11 independent reductions
in the number of digits from a pentadactyl condition (ten
if digit configurations for internal nodes observed among
described species of Lerista are preferred; see Figure 1). A
further seven reductions are inferred to have proceeded
independently from a tetradactyl condition derived from
one of these reductions (that in the most recent shared
ancestor of flammicauda and the orientalis species group).
Four independent losses of all manual and pedal digits are
inferred, three from pentadactyl or tetradactyl conditions.
Assuming an age of 13.4 million years for Lerista, estimated using molecular dating methods (see Methods and
Additional file 2), the loss of all digits from a pentadactyl
condition in ameles, apoda, and stylis has occurred within a
period of 11.8 million years. The most recent tetradactyl
ancestor of ameles and stylis is no more than 9.7 million
years old, while that of apoda is no more than 9.2 million
years old. The highest rate of complete loss of digits from
a pentadactyl or tetradactyl condition is inferred for humphriesi and praepedita; the most recent shared ancestor of
these species (having a reconstructed digit configuration
of no manual or pedal digits) is separated from an
inferred pentadactyl ancestor by no more than 3.6 million
years (it should be noted that limb loss could have
occurred over only part of this interval, so that the actual
rate of limb reduction may be substantially greater). This
is considerably more rapid than the rate implied by Brandley et al.'s [5] estimate of the minimum interval over
which limb loss has occurred in more than 20 squamate
lineages (16 million years; see Background). As Brandley
et al. [5] note, however, their estimates represent maximum values, and so may significantly overestimate the
amount of time necessary for this radical evolutionary
transition. Accordingly, it is at least conceivable that the
higher rates of limb loss inferred here for Lerista are representative of those for squamates generally. This perspective suggests a pattern of body form evolution differing
markedly from that envisaged by Wiens and Slingluff [4]
for anguids (i.e., gradual change occurring over extended
periods), and, if substantiated, would emphasise the significance of Brandley et al.'s [5] finding that intermediate
phenotypes may persist for tens of millions of years.
Almost invariably, species with greatly reduced limbs are
separated from inferred pentadactyl or tetradactyl ancestors by very few nodes, so that, assuming limb reduction

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/310

has not been saltational (i.e., that synchronous loss of several digits from the manus and pes has not occurred),
reconstruction of complete sequences of digit loss for
individual lineages is not possible. Nonetheless, if digit
loss is presumed to proceed similarly across all (or at least
many) lineages, general conclusions concerning the mode
of limb reduction may be derived from a consideration of
inferred losses for lineages exhibiting varying degrees of
reduction. Thus, a plot of the numbers of manual and
pedal digits lost in all reductions from a pentadactyl or tetradactyl condition versus the total number of (manual
and pedal) digits lost (Figure 2) may be considered to
indicate that in the initial stages of limb reduction rates of
digit loss are similar for the manus and pes, however, as
limb reduction progresses, manual digits are lost more
readily than pedal digits. This is consistent with a more
significant role of the hindlimb in limb-mediated locomotion and selection for some ability to employ limbmediated locomotion (as an adjunct to undulatory locomotion, which becomes increasingly important as limb
reduction and body elongation proceed) in limb-reduced
species. Particular intermediate digit configurations, most
conspicuously that of no digits for the manus and two digits for the pes, generally originate relatively rapidly and
persist for extended periods. This pattern intimates that
these configurations do not represent transitory stages in
a continuing process of limb reduction and provides further evidence for adaptive retention of digits, consistent
with Brandley et al.'s [5] proposal that intermediate phenotypes may be targets of selection.

Conclusion
Many authors have noted the recurring evolution of an
elongate, limb-reduced body form in squamates, however, even within this clade, the frequency and rate of limb
reduction inferred here for Lerista are exceptional. Ancestral state reconstructions imply 27 instances of limb
reduction (see Figure 1), almost as many as reported by
Greer [3] for all remaining scincids, and nearly half the
number of reductions inferred for all other squamates. An
interval of no more than 3.6 million years for the complete loss of limbs in one lineage of Lerista is less than one
fourth of Brandley et al.'s [5] minimum estimate of the
time required for this substantial phenotypic transition.
These results emphasise the potential for extensive alteration of body form in squamates over (geologically) brief
periods. An absence of cogent evidence for reversals of
digit loss in Lerista contrasts with Kohlsdorf and Wagner's
[9] proposal that digits have been regained in some species of Bachia, possibly reflecting an influence of differing
environmental and genetic contexts on the evolution of
limb morphology in these clades. Future study of the
genetic, developmental, and ecological bases of limb
reduction and loss in Lerista promises the elucidation of
not only this phenomenon in squamates, but also the dra-

Methods
Phylogenetic analysis
Specimen registration and collection locality data are provided in Additional file 3. ATP synthetase-β subunit
intron, 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, and ND4 and adjacent
tRNA-His, tRNA-Ser, and tRNA-Leu fragments were
amplified and sequenced as described by Skinner [16].
Alignment of ND4 sequences did not require the insertion
of gaps and was straightforward. 12S, 16S, and tRNA
sequences were initially aligned with Clustal X [17]
assuming the default pairwise and multiple alignment
parameter values. Adjustments to alignments were made
with the aid of secondary-structure models [18-20]. ATP
synthetase-β subunit intron sequences were aligned with
Clustal X using the default settings. All sequences are
deposited in GenBank (accession numbers, DQ915284,
DQ915289, DQ915292, DQ915308, DQ915313,
DQ915316, DQ915332, DQ915337, DQ915340,
DQ915357, DQ915363, DQ915367, DQ915387,
EF672754–EF673036).

Aligned sequences were partitioned according to locus
and, for protein-encoding (i.e., ND4) sequences, codon

position (the tRNAs were considered as a single partition,
resulting in seven partitions; see Additional file 4). All partitions were analysed simultaneously using mixed-model
Bayesian methods, implemented in MrBayes [21]. An
appropriate nucleotide substitution model for each partition was selected on the basis of hierarchical likelihoodratio tests, performed using Modeltest [22]. Four incrementally-heated Markov chains, initiated with random
starting trees and default priors, were run for 107 generations, sampling every 1000th generation. Parameter values
for each specified model were estimated independently
(i.e., parameter values were unlinked across partitions).
The number of generations required to attain stationarity
was estimated by examining cumulative posterior probabilities for clades, plotted using AWTY [23]. All trees sampled prior to attaining stationarity were discarded and the
remaining trees used to compute a majority-rule consensus topology, branch lengths, and posterior probabilities
for nodes. Parsimony and likelihood analyses yield results
similar to those for the Bayesian analysis (see Additional
files 5 and 6).
Penalised likelihood rate smoothing [24], performed with
r8s [25], was employed to produce an ultrametric tree
from the Bayesian majority-rule consensus (with mean
branch lengths and an arbitrary age of 1.0 specified for the
root node). This tree was assumed in inferring ancestral
states (see below) and calculating absolute ages for nodes
(see below and Additional file 2).
Ancestral state reconstruction
Modal digit configurations for extant species of Lerista
were collated from data in the literature, verified and augmented by our own observations of specimens in the
South Australian Museum and Western Australian
Museum. It should be noted that only those digits having
one or more phalanges were counted; in some cases, species possess metacarpals and metatarsals for digits
regarded here as absent. Maximum likelihood numbers of
manual and pedal digits for internal nodes were determined independently using Mesquite [26], assuming the
asymmetrical Markov k-state 2-parameter (AsymmMk)
model of character evolution. The two parameters in this
model describe instantaneous rates of forward and reverse
transitions, corresponding in our analyses to rates of digit
loss and gain. Inclusion of separate rate parameters for all
possible transitions does not significantly improve model
fit (the alternative models were compared by means of a
likelihood-ratio test, performed using M. Pagel's program
Multistate). Parsimony methods for inferring ancestral
states may perform poorly where rates of character state
transition are high (e.g., [27]) and are less amenable to
statistical comparisons of alternative reconstructions than
likelihood methods (see [28]), and, accordingly, were not
employed.

The extent to which the ancestral state reconstructions
depend on assumed rates of character state transition was
assessed by comparing ancestral states inferred for a range
of rates with those reconstructed assuming the maximum
likelihood rates. Limb reduction is generally considered to
be only exceedingly rarely (perhaps never) reversed (e.g.,
[3,10,11,29]; see, however, [5,9]) and we therefore
focussed on rates of digit gain. Ancestral states were reconstructed for rates of digit gain representing all values not
significantly less likely than the maximum likelihood estimate (according to likelihood-ratio tests) assuming estimated (i.e., optimal) rates of digit loss in each case.
As a means of evaluating the influence of uncertainty in
inferred phylogenetic relationships and branch lengths,
we reconstructed ancestral states across 1000 trees (every
fifth of 5000 trees) sampled after attaining stationarity in
the Bayesian analysis using the 'Trace Character Over
Trees' option in Mesquite [26]. For each node in the Bayesian majority-rule consensus, numbers of manual and
pedal digits were inferred for all trees containing that
node; the variability of inferred states among trees provides a measure of the degree to which ancestral state
reconstructions for the node concerned are affected by
uncertainty in tree topology and branch lengths (see
[30,31]). As this method may overestimate the confidence
that can be placed in inferred ancestral states (because
only trees incorporating the node of concern are examined [31]), the proportion of trees for which reconstructed
ancestral states imply one or more reversals of limb reduction was also determined directly. A reversal was inferred
where the greatest number of digits (or a higher number)
observed among the set of species defined by a node was
significantly less likely than the maximum likelihood
state for that node (alternative states were compared on
the basis of their contribution to the total likelihood for a
tree, with differences of less than two log-likelihood units
being considered insignificant; see [28]). Ancestral states
were reconstructed across trees for a range of rates of digit
gain as described above.
Estimation of divergence times
Although no fossil record exists for Lerista, fossil scincids
from the Oligo-Miocene to Pliocene limestone deposits of
Riversleigh enabled the calibration of a phylogeny for
lygosomines from which an absolute divergence time for
two species of Lerista (bipes and bougainvillii) could be
derived and used to calibrate the ultrametric tree in Figure
1. The lygosomine phylogeny was inferred from published 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, and ND4 and adjacent tRNAHis, tRNA-Ser, and tRNA-Leu nucleotide sequences (2356
aligned sites) for 59 species. A majority-rule consensus of
trees sampled in a Bayesian analysis of the combined
sequence data is presented in Additional file 2. Penalised

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/310

likelihood rate smoothing [24] was employed to produce
an ultrametric tree from this consensus (with mean
branch lengths and an arbitrary age of 10.0 specified for
the root node) that was calibrated using the Riversleigh
fossils. The calibrated phylogeny implies an absolute
divergence time for Lerista bipes and Lerista bougainvillii of
12.1 million years, yielding an age of 13.4 million years
for Lerista (see Additional file 2 for a more thorough discussion of the methods employed in estimating divergence times).
