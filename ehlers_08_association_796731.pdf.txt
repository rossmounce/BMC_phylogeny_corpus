Abstract
Background: Variation in response to the hedonic and adverse effects of a substance is in part an
inherited factor that may influence its use, abuse and dependence. The mu opioid receptor is the
primary site of action for opiates and individuals with polymorphisms in this receptor appear to
have variation in the CNS effects of opiates. Several studies have suggested that this receptor may
also mediate some of the effects of non-opioid drugs, such as alcohol. The purpose of this study
was to investigate associations between 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the mu opioid
receptor gene (OPRM1) with self-reported responses to alcohol, an endophenotype associated
with the development of alcohol dependence, in American Indians living on eight contiguous
reservations.
Methods: Each participant gave a blood sample and completed a structured diagnostic interview.
Additionally, response to alcohol was indexed using the expectation version of the subjective high
assessment scale (SHAS-E). SNPs were genotyped in 251 participants and data analyses were
conducted using SOLAR.
Results: The estimated heritability (h2) for the SHAS-E phenotypes ranged from 0.01 to 0.28.
Endorsing the expectation of a more intense response on one or more of the following items from
the SHAS-E: buzzed, clumsy, dizzy, drunk, effects, high, nausea, sleepy, talkative, terrible, and/or
uncomfortable after imbibing 2–3 drinks was significantly associated with having at least one minor
allele for at least one of 7 SNPs (p < 0.01) in the OPRM1 receptor gene.
Conclusion: These studies provide data to suggest that the minor allele, for most of the
polymorphisms in the OPRM1 receptor gene investigated, was found to be associated with a more
intense, and/or more adverse, response to alcohol, traits that are significantly correlated with
lowered quantity of alcohol consumption and less susceptibility to dependence in this Indian
population. These data further suggest that making conclusions on the role of the mu opiod
receptor gene in the development of alcohol dependence may be limited if only one polymorphism
in the gene is evaluated in isolation.

Background
A number of studies have documented that the dosage
requirements for targeted effects of CNS drugs can vary
widely [1]. For example, in a study of over 3,000 patients
experiencing pain following postoperative hip replacement, the therapeutic morphine dosage requirements varied almost 40-fold [2]. Wide inter-patient variability in
response to, and therefore in the dosage requirement for
morphine have been demonstrated in cancer patients
receiving morphine for pain control [3].
It appears that a number of genetic and environmental
factors can lead to significant variation in the doses of a
drug necessary to produce therapeutic, hedonic and/or
adverse effects. However, there is increasing evidence that
gene polymorphisms may be an important factor in determining a person's sensitivity and tolerance to a drug. The
mu opioid receptor (OPRM1) is the primary site of action
for opiates; about 20 variants in the mu opioid receptor
gene (OPRM1) have been identified with amino acid substitutions that have polymorphic frequencies over 1% [411]. The most common single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) reported on is A118G (rs1799971), which encoded
the Asp40Asn codon change with most data suggesting
that it is a functional variant [4,12].
There have been a series of studies in both healthy volunteers and in clinical patients suggesting that, the A118G
variant may alter response to opioid drugs (see [1] for
review). Lotsch and colleagues reported the 118G allele
conferred smaller analgesic effects and produced less
pupillary constriction during morphine and morphine-6glucuronide (MG6) infusion [13-15]. In an experiment
using a measure of pain tolerance to electrical stimulation, higher MG6 concentrations were associated with a
25% increase in current (C25) participants with the 118G
allele [16,17]. Similar findings have been found for alfentanil [18] and levomethdone [19]. In clinical studies, data
from patients with the 118G polymorphism tend to confirm data from experimental pain studies where those
patients with the variant required higher alfentanil doses
for analgesia or more morphine during colorectal surgery
[20] or for pain/toxicity associated with morphine use in
renal failure [13,14]. However, it appears that the effects
may be drug or disease specific owing to presumed variation in environmental and/or other uncontrolled variables [1,21,22].
Several studies have suggested that the mu receptor may
also mediate some of the hedonic and/or addictive effects
of non-opioid drugs, such as alcohol [23,24]. Indirect
support for this hypothesis is provided by studies demonstrating the efficacy of naltrexone for the treatment of
alcohol dependence [25-31]. Further support is provided
by studies evaluating associations between response to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/9/35

naltrexone pharmacotherapy for alcohol dependence and
the presence of the A118G variant. In a study that combined data from three different clinical trials, Oslin and
colleagues [32] demonstrated that carriers of the 118G
allele had a significantly lower rate of relapse and a longer
time to a return to heavy drinking when compared to
those individuals who were homozygous for the 118A
allele. This finding was not supported in the Veterans
Affairs (VA) Cooperative Study where no significant interactions were found between naltrexone treatment
response and any polymorphic variants at each of the
three opioid receptor genes [33]. More recently, data from
the Study for the Combined Pharmacotherapies and
Behavioral Interventions for Alcohol Dependence (COMBINE) study demonstrated that treatment with naltrexone
produced a significantly improved clinical global outcome in alcohol dependent participants with the 118G
allele, as compared to those with the 118A allele [34]. The
A118G polymorphism has also been associated with an
individual's response to a naloxone challenge with subjects with the 118G allele showing higher plasma cortisol
concentrations [35,36].
There has been a plethora of studies that have investigated
the relationship between a diagnosis of drug and/or alcohol dependence and the A118G polymorphism. The
results have been conflicting and inconsistent. In a recent
meta-analysis of 28 different studies, including over 8000
subjects, the conclusion was that the OPRM1 A118G variant did not appear to affect risk for substance dependence.
However, the authors further speculated that additional
research would be needed to determine whether another
polymorphism in the gene might influence receptor function and thus risk for substance dependence [37]. An
additional feature of these studies, that may have weakened the results, is the use of a dichotomous phenotype,
drug dependence, a diagnosis that is made based on both
heritable and non-heritable factors [38]. Town and colleagues [39] suggested that genetic studies on the influence of mu opioid receptors polymorphisms be viewed
within the broader context of alcoholism where the opioid receptor genes are taken to be partial, rather than complete, risk factors for the disorder. Thus, it may be that
polymorphisms in OPRM1 encode for a variant that influences a more narrowly defined risk factor for alcoholism.
This risk factor is envisioned to partially influence the
development of the disorder, but may or may not ultimately be associated with the diagnosis depending on the
age of the participant, presence of other risk factors and
environmental variables.
Individual sensitivity to alcohol represents such an inherited factor that affects the likelihood of drinking and
mediates the disposition for developing alcoholism [40],
and has a strong genetic basis [41]. In general, people at

higher genetic risk for alcoholism are less sensitive to the
effects of alcohol and people at lower genetic risk for alcoholism are more sensitive. Support for this theory is provided by many, but not all, studies examining the reaction
to alcohol among children of alcoholics, who are at
greatly elevated risk for developing alcoholism [42].
Results have indicated that at moderate doses of alcohol,
subjects who are family history positive for alcoholism
and subjects who are family history negative for alcoholism attain equivalent blood alcohol concentrations, but
most studies have found that subjects with a positive family history rate themselves as significantly less intoxicated
than control subjects with a negative family history [4346]. Although not all studies agree [47], a meta-analysis
focusing on subjective level of intoxication confirmed a
diminished response to alcohol as a characteristic more
frequently seen in subjects with a positive family history
than in those with a negative family history [48]. In addition, an 8-year follow-up of previously studied men with
positive and negative family histories found that both a
family history of alcoholism and a low response to alcohol were related to the development of alcohol-related
problems [49].
Studies using similar methodologies among groups at
lower risk for alcoholism have provided additional support for the idea that individual sensitivity to alcohol
might also mediate protection from developing alcoholism. Individuals of Asian heritage, who have mutations in
the aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (ALDH2) [50-53], and
individuals of Jewish decent [54], two groups with low
rates of alcoholism, were found to have more intense,
although not necessarily more negative, responses to alcohol than matched control subjects of average alcoholism
risk.
Genetic studies of complex phenotypes, such as sensitivity
to alcohol, often have advantages when they are conducted in well-defined populations such as Native American tribes living on reservations [55]. A once popular
notion, called the firewater myth, proposed that Native
American Indians are constitutionally predisposed to an
altered response to drinking alcohol [56]. In one empirical study, Native American Indians, like Caucasian sons of
alcoholics, were found to have less intense objective and
subjective effects of alcohol in an alcohol challenge paradigm. Additionally, participants with at least 50% Native
American heritage reported less intense effects of alcohol
than did those with less than 50% Native American heritage, despite equivalent blood alcohol concentrations [5759].
The present report is part of a larger study exploring risk
factors for substance dependence among Native American
Indians [57-68]. The lifetime prevalence of substance

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/9/35

dependence in this Indian population is high and evidence for heritability and linkage to specific chromosome
locations has been demonstrated [65,69-72]. The purpose
of the present set of analyses was to determine if a significant association could be detected between 13 SNPs in the
OPRM1 receptor gene and self-report of subjective
response to alcohol in this population.

Methods
Participants, who were of mixed heritage but at least onesixteenth Native American, were recruited from eight geographically contiguous reservations with a total population of about 3,000 individuals. They were recruited using
a combination of a venue-based method [73,74], and a
respondent-driven procedure [75], as described previously [64,76]. To be included in the study a participant
had to be an American Indian of one of four tribal groups
between the age of 18 and 70 without major medical
problems that would preclude mobility.
Potential participants gave written informed consent
using a protocol approved for the study by The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of The Scripps Research Institute, the Scientific Advisory Committee of the GCRC, and
the Indian Health Council, a tribal review group overseeing health issues for the reservations where recruitment
was undertaken. They also responded to a screening questionnaire that was used to gather information on demographics, personal medical history, ethnicity and detailed
measures of substance abuse history [77] and weight &
height. Each participant also completed an interview with
the Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism (SSAGA) [78], which was used to make diagnoses
[79]. Response to alcohol was assessed using the subjective high assessment scale-expectations version (SHAS-E).
This scale consists of 14 items rated on Likert scales ranging from 0 (normal) to 36 (extreme effect). The participants indicated how intoxicated they felt after drinking 2–
3 drinks for the following items: buzzed, clumsy, dizzy,
drunk, effects of alcohol, energy, good, high, nausea,
sleepy, talkative, uncomfortable, terrible overall and great
overall. A total score was also calculated for the first 12
SHAS-E items. The intersession reliability of the SHAS,
from which the SHAS-E was constructed, is approximately
0.80 with a Cronbach alpha of 0.96 overall [80]. The
items cluster together with an overall item-to-total correlation of 0.80 or higher and a Cronbach alpha of 0.96. The
Cronbach alpha for the SHAS-E is also 0.96 and values on
the SHAS-E have been demonstrated to significantly (p <
0.0001) correlate with responses on the alcohol challenge
SHAS at 30 and 60 minutes (r2 = 0.49, 30 min, r2 = 0.51,
60 min) (Schuckit and Smith, personal communication).
Two hundred (251) individuals have both genotype and
phenotype data for this analyses. Power analyses revealed

Since genotype data was not available from the International HapMap Project public database[82] at the time
this study was conceived (October 2004), seventeen single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near the OPRM1
locus were selected from the Applied Biosystems SNP
database [83]. SNPs were initially chosen to be evenly distributed across OPRM1 with an average intermarker spacing of 5,133 bp. Assays for three SNPs (rs561720,
hCV32237184, rs3798687) failed and were excluded
from analyses. One SNP, rs12333298 in intron 1, showed
significant (p = 0.018) deviations from Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium (HWE) at a p < 0.05 level and was also
dropped from further analyses. The locations of the thirteen remaining SNPs typed in the study are shown in Figure 1 and SNP information, including the observed minor
allele frequency (MAF), is described in Table 1.

that for a medium effect size (0.5) that power at this n
would be equal to 0.976. DNA was isolated from whole
blood using an automated DNA extraction procedure. All
primers, probes and reagents were purchased from ABI
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). SNPs were genotyped using TaqMan™ fluorescence 5' exonuclease technology. Each 5 microL reaction contained 25 ng genomic
DNA, 1.6× TaqMan assay primer/probe mix, 1× PCR
Buffer A, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 250 microM dNTPs, and 0.5 U
AmpliTaq Gold polymerase. Thermocycling was performed as recommended by ABI. Genotypes were determined on an ABI 7900 HT Fast Real-Time PCR System
using the allelic discrimination mode. Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium analyses were completed in Haploview (version 4.0) [81].

bPosition

The OPRM1 region spanned by the 13 SNPs analyzed in
this study is 81.8 kb. This region includes 140 SNPs that
were typed by the HapMap project. Because the allele frequencies observed in this Indian population for each of
the SNPs is intermediate between the allele frequencies
observed for the European (CEU) and Asian (JC) HapMap
populations, we investigated the linkage disequilibrium
structure in these populations. The inferred CEU and JP
population haplotypes were used estimate the consensus
phylogenic tree based on 500 bootstrapped trees produced with Neighbor-Joining method based on Kimura
distance matrix as implemented in PHYLIP [84].

ducted where the number of copies of the minor allele of
each individual was used as a covariate in a variance component analysis as implemented in SOLAR v2.0.4 [86],
and the statistical significance of the ability of the covariate to explain phenotypic variance was determined. Age
and sex were also accounted for in the analyses. To
account for multiple comparisons, in these exploratory
analyses, nominal significance was set at the p < 0.01
level.

Results

The inferred haplotypes for the 140 available SNPs for
CEU and JP populations can be divided into four major
clades, which can be further subdivided into related clades
some of which may arisen from recombination of the primary clades. Each of the subclades characteristically is relatively specific to either the CEU or JP population based
on additional SNPs that were typed in by the HapMap
project. It was found using haplotype analysis that the
SNPs typed in the present study represented the major
haplotypes identified in HapMap but they were unable to
identify the large number of minor haplotypes. Ultimately, a more complete analysis depends on resequencing the OPRM1 gene and determining which sequence
variants have functional significance.

The demographic characteristics of the sample are virtually equivalent to the U.S. census data for these tribes and
have been presented previously [65,87]. The mean age of
the sample was 30.2 (± 0.7) yrs, there were 110 males and
141 females with a mean of 11.5(0.1) yrs of education,
60% of the sample was over 50% Native American heritage as estimated by their federal Indian blood quantum
and 55% reported income of less than $20,000 per
annum. Within the sample of 251 participants 160 (64%)
were found to have a lifetime DSM-III-R diagnosis of alcohol dependence and an additional 47(18.7%) were found
to have alcohol abuse. One hundred seventy-three (69%)
were current drinkers who reported a mean of 13 years of
alcohol use. The mean number of drinking occasions
reported per month was 10 and their mean drinks per
occasion were nine.

The total additive genetic variance (heritability, h2) and its
standard error were estimated for the SHAS-E phenotypes
using SOLAR [85]. A genetic association analyses was con-

ses [64,70,71]. The 251 individuals originated from a total
of 41 families, comprising of 1 to 4 generations, with an
average number of seven members per family (range, 1–
30). The 251 individuals within the 41 families that were
genetically informative includes: 77 parent-child, 212 sibling, 26 half sibling, 8 grandparent-grandchild, 151 avuncular, and 245 cousin relative pairs [65]. Marker
information including genetic map position, location
within OPRM1, and minor allele frequencies within this
Indian population (as well as four reference populations
for comparison) are listed in Table 1. Mendelian inconsistencies were identified using PEDSTATS [88] and made
up 0.03% of the data. The physical locations of and pattern of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the 13 SNPs
typed across the OPRM1 gene are schematically presented
in Figure 1.
The estimated heritability (h2) for the SHAS-E phenotypes
ranged from near to zero for "energy" to .28 for "terrible"
(see Table 2). The only two phenotypes with significant
heritability were talkative and terrible (p < 0.01). Table 2
also gives values for the mean ± S.D. for each of the SHASE items as well as the total for this population. As seen in
Table 3, endorsing a more intense response on one or
more of the following SHAS-E items: dizzy, drunk, high,
nausea, talkative, and/or uncomfortable after imbibing 2–
3 drinks was significantly associated with having at least
one minor allele for 7 SNPs (p < 0.01) in or near the
OPRM1 receptor gene. Whereas, for the 118G allele, the
most commonly genotyped Asn40Asp polymorphism,
there was only a trend for an association with reporting a
less intense response to alcohol for the items: dizzy (p <
0.02) and sleepy (p < 0.02).

Discussion
The CNS effects of alcohol range from mild euphoria
(high), to impaired coordination, to ataxia, decreased
mentation, labile mood, to poor judgment, slurred
speech, nausea and vomiting, and finally to respiratory
failure, coma and death, depending on the dose imbibed
[89]. The final level of impairment appears to depend on
a number of factors including a persons' gender, age,
weight, prior experience with alcohol and level of tolerance [40]. Another source of variation in response to alcohol is individual variation in alcohol metabolism. Some
individuals, particularly East Asians who are homozygous
for the ALDH2*2 allele, are intolerant of alcohol and
report intense facial flushing, tachycardia, hypotension,
headache, nausea and vomiting following drinking more
than one drink [67]. African Americans, with at least one
ADH1B*3, also report expecting to have a more intense
response to a standard dose of alcohol when compared to
African Americans who are homozygous for the
ADH1B*1 allele [90].
Other sources of the genetic variation in sensitivity and
tolerance to alcohol not attributed to differences in alcohol metabolism are less well understood. Several studies
have found moderate heritability for level of response to
alcohol. In one study, heritability was found to be 60%
for a composite sensitivity measure that was used during
an alcohol challenge in twins [91]. Correlations of level of
response to alcohol using body sway and the SHAS in an
alcohol challenge paradigm using sibling pairs as participants was reported to be 0.36 [41]. Lower correlations
were found in first-degree relatives using a retrospective
self-report measure to assess level of response to alcohol

The increaser allele for the TOTAL phenotype (i.e., the allele associated with a higher TOTAL score)
TOTAL = sum of scores reported for the first 12 SHAS-E items.

ity of the SHAS-E were found to range from near to zero
(for energy) to 0.28 (for terrible).
Further evidence for a genetic component to level of
response to alcohol was provided by a genome-wide segregation analysis that evaluated subjective response to
alcohol challenge in sibpairs. In that study, nine chromosome regions with LOD scores between 2.2 and 3.2 suggesting potential regions of interest in the genome that
may contribute to the variance in alcohol responsivity
[41]. An expanded dataset, collected in the same laboratory, also identified five areas of the genome with LOD
scores between 2.2 and 2.6 for level of response to alcohol
in sibpairs [92]. None of the locations identified in those
studies were on chromosome 6 (6q24q25) near the location of the mu opioid receptor. However, a previous study
in this Indian population found suggestion for linkage on
chromosome 6q24q25 for several substance dependence
phenotypes, as well as Body Mass Index, suggesting genes
in that location may be associated with risk for substance
dependence and other consumption-related phenotypes
[71].
In the present study, evidence was obtained for an association between expectations of the effects of a standard
dose of alcohol and polymorphisms in the OPRM1 receptor gene. Participants with at least one 118G allele for the
Asp40Asn polymorphism reported that they expected to
feel a less intense response to alcohol for the items: dizzy
(p < 0.02) and sleepy (p < 0.02) when compared to individuals without any 118G alleles, findings that were not
significant in these analyses when multiple comparisons
were taken into account. These data are, however, consistent with data from Kim and colleagues [93], who found
that alcoholics with two copies of the 118G allele spent

more days drinking than those who were heterozygous or
homozygous for the 118A allele, perhaps suggesting a less
intense response to alcohol. Assuming that alcohol may
act as a partial agonist at the mu opioid receptor, the findings in the present study of a trend for reduced effect of
alcohol in participants with the 118G allele, are also consistent with studies that evaluated response to opioid agonists where a reduced response to drug challenge
(pupillary diameter, pain, respiratory depression) and/or
increased dosage requirements are seen in those individuals with the 118G allele (see [1] for review).
Few studies have evaluated whether an association exists
between response to alcohol and polymorphisms in the
OPRM1 gene. In one study, the ability of naltrexone to
blunt an alcohol-induced high was found to be greater in
those participants with the 118G allele [94]. The finding
of a more intense response to a mu opioid receptor antagonist found by Ray and Hutchinson [94] is consistent
with previous studies that have demonstrated that subjects with the 118G allele that were given naloxone had
higher cortisol concentrations [36]. It is also consistent
with the finding that naltrexone may be more efficacious
for the treatment of alcoholism in those with at least one
118G allele [32]. However, Ray and Hutchinson [94,95]
have also reported that young participants in an IV alcohol challenge, with one 118G allele, reported feeling more
subjective feelings of "high" across rising breath alcohol
concentrations, as compared to those participants
homozygous for the 118A allele. These findings are not
consistent with the findings in the present study for the
118G allele, nor are they particularly consistent with studies that have found a less intense response to opioid agonists. However, the findings of Ray and Hutchinson
[94,95] are consistent with the findings in the present

study of an association between expecting to experience a
more intense response to alcohol and carrying at least one
minor allele for eight other SNPs in the opioid receptor
gene. Since, in the study of Ray and Hutchinson [94,95],
only one SNP was genotyped and the ethnic characteristics of the sample were not specified, it is possible that the
findings reflected stratification of the sample or that the
A118G variant was in linkage disequilibrium with several
other alleles that may encode for a more intense response
to alcohol. These data further suggest that making conclusions on the role of the mu opioid receptor gene in the
development of alcohol-related behaviors may be limited
if only one polymorphism in the gene is evaluated in isolation.
Several alcohol- or drug-related association studies [9699] have expanded their investigations to include up to 20
SNPs in or near OPRM1, although all include the A118G
variant. Ide and colleagues [96] genotyped 20 SNPs
including 10 SNPs in the 3'UTR region among Japanese
subjects meeting ICD-10 criteria for methamphetamine
(MAP) dependence/psychosis and controls. Four SNPs
(including the A118G and rs2075572 variants that were
genotyped in the present study) representing the major
haplotypes observed in the study sample were tested for
association with four features of MAP dependence/psychosis. While A118G and two other SNPs were not associated with MAP dependence/psychosis, the rs2075572 Gallele was significantly associated with increased risk for a
diagnosis of MAP dependence/psychosis (p = 0.011), as
well as four aspects/symptoms of the disorder (p < 0.01).
Interestingly, within this Indian population, the
rs2075572 G-allele was related to expecting to feel a more
intense response to alcohol in four of the 14 items of the
SHAS-E, an indication that carriers of this allele may be
protected from developing alcohol dependence. Zhang
and colleagues [98] investigated the relationship between
heroin-induced subjective responses in a Chinese population and ten SNPs selected throughout OPRM1. They
found three SNPs in intron 1 were associated with an
increased risk of positive responses on first use of heroin
and were likely contributing to further heroin consumption. However, A118G and rs2075572 were not associated
with any differences in heroin-induced subjective
responses. In another study, Luo and colleagues [97]
typed eight variants in alcohol, cocaine and opioid and
poly-substance dependent European Americans (EA) and
African Americans (AA). They found that the A-allele of
the -2044C/A polymorphism was a susceptibility allele for
the combination of alcohol and opioid dependence in the
EA sample, but not the AA sample. Once again, A118G
was not associated with any of the substance dependent
phenotypes. Finally, Zhang and colleagues [99] studied
the role of OPRM1 genetic variation in a large case-control
sample of alcohol dependent and/or drug (cocaine and/or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/9/35

opioid) dependent European Americans. Thirteen SNPs,
five of which were typed in the present study, were genotyped representing the major haplotypes observed in HapMap. Seven SNPs (but not A118) were associated with
alcohol, cocaine, opioid plus opioid/cocaine dependency.
Zhang and colleagues [99] found that the frequencies of
the rs524731 A-allele and rs648893 T-allele were significantly higher among the dependent EA subjects. Within
this Indian population, the rs524731 A-allele and
rs648893 T-allele were generally associated with a more
intense response to alcohol.

Conclusion
In conclusion, these data represent the first association
analysis of a level of response to alcohol phenotype with
multiple SNPs in the OPMR1 receptor gene in American
Indians. SNPs highlighted in prior studies of substance
dependence phenotypes were also identified as well as
new SNPs of potential importance to substance dependence research. The results of this study should, however,
be interpreted in the context of several limitations. A more
conservative approach to multiple comparisons would
have led to fewer significant effects. Level of response to
alcohol was evaluated using the SHAS-E, and a more
direct measure of intoxication using the SHAS or body
sway may produce more reliable results. Haplotype analysis using the SNPs typed in this study was unable to specially tag all of the clades observed in the HapMap
population. Ultimately, a more complete analysis
depends on resequencing the OPRM1 and determining
which sequence variants have functional significance.
Additionally, the findings may not generalize to other
Native Americans or represent all Indians of the tribes
studied, and comparisons of association findings to nonIndian populations may be limited by differences in a
host of potential genetic and environmental variables.
Finally, because this population has significant admixture
estimates of allele frequencies may produce biased results.
Despite these limitations, this report represents an important step in an ongoing investigation to understand the
genetic determinants associated with the development of
substance use disorders in this high risk and understudied
ethnic group.
