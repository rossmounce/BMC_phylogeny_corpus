Abstract
Background: The self-fertile hermaphrodite worm C. elegans is an important model organism for
biology, yet little is known about the origin and persistence of the self-fertilizing mode of
reproduction in this lineage. Recent work has demonstrated an extraordinary degree of selfing
combined with a high deleterious mutation rate in contemporary populations. These observations
raise the question as to whether the mutation load might rise to such a degree as to eventually
threaten the species with extinction. The potential for such a process to occur would inform our
understanding of the time since the origin of self-fertilization in C. elegans history.
Results: To address this issue, here we quantify the rate of fitness decline expected to occur via
Muller's ratchet for a purely selfing population, using both analytical approximations and globally
distributed individual-based simulations from the evolution@home system to compute the rate of
deleterious mutation accumulation. Using the best available estimates for parameters of how C.
elegans evolves, we conclude that pure selfing can persist for only short evolutionary intervals, and
is expected to lead to extinction within thousands of years for a plausible portion of parameter
space. Credible lower-bound estimates of nuclear mutation rates do not extend the expected time
to extinction much beyond a million years.
Conclusion: Thus we conclude that either the extreme self-fertilization implied by current
patterns of genetic variation in C. elegans arose relatively recently or that low levels of outcrossing
and other factors are key to the persistence of C. elegans into the present day. We also discuss
results for the mitochondrial genome and the implications for C. briggsae, a close relative that made
the transition to selfing independently of C. elegans.

Background
The bactivorous nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an
established model for molecular genetics, development,
neurobiology, and, more recently, for evolutionary biology [1]. One of the principal features that distinguishes
this species from most of its congeners is the existence of

self-fertile hermaphrodites. It is now clear that hermaphrodites evolved from females in at least two Caenorhabditis
lineages [2,3]. However, the age of self-fertilization in C.
elegans' history is a longstanding question. The lack of a
good fossil record for nematodes means that we must
focus on theoretical and molecular methods for inferring

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:125

the timing of such ancestral events. It is important to
acquire a better understanding of how long hermaphrodites have persisted in the C. elegans lineage because a
recent versus ancient origin of selfing will strongly influence our inferences from comparative analyses and population genetic patterns, and our interpretations about the
adaptive nature of phenotypes. In the present study, we
explore this issue by considering the potential for extinction to occur by way of Muller's Ratchet [4-6] in the context of parameters that describe how C. elegans evolves.
Muller's ratchet leads to the stochastic accumulation of
slightly deleterious mutations in finite asexual populations [4,5](for a review see [6]). This process operates by
the sequential loss of the class of individuals in a population that have the highest fitness, resulting in an irrecoverable ratcheting up of the mutation load. In the absence of
mitigating factors, this process can lead to population
extinction [7-9]. Muller's ratchet also accumulates deleterious mutations in selfers, with the dynamics being
described appropriately by a simple rescaling of parameters relative to the asexual case [10-12]. This rescaling
allows us to predict the rate of mutation accumulation
from Muller's ratchet in selfing organisms by using a
methodology established for asexual systems [6]. Consequently, we apply this approach to infer the expected time
to extinction by Muller's ratchet for lines of C. elegans
under the assumption that outcrossing stopped immediately upon the origin of the self-fertile lineage. Estimates
of the effective population size for C. elegans based on
genetic variation are generally small [13-16], particularly
as compared to related obligately outbreeding species
[17]; this observation reinforces the potential for Muller's
ratchet to operate in this system. Because C. elegans populations do undergo low levels of outcrossing in nature,
which could ameliorate the effects of Muller's ratchet, this
approach provides a benchmark for the time over which
C. elegans can persist in a purely self-fertile state.
Two qualitative outcomes may result from such an analysis. (i) The expected extinction times might exceed the
time since divergence from the closest outcrossing relative. In this case, we could conclude that Muller's ratchet
is an unimportant factor for the persistence of the species
subject to selfing, because insufficient time would have
elapsed to have resulted in extinction by this process. (ii)
The expected time to extinction might be much shorter
than the time since divergence from the nearest outcrossing relative. In this case, extinction times provide either an
upper limit on the time since the origin of selfing or they
indicate that some other biological process, such as outcrossing or compensatory mutation, must occur with sufficient frequency to offset genomic decay in the long term.
While a variety of such potential processes are possible

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/125

(see review in[6]), simpler models are preferable in the
absence of evidence supporting their operation.
Here we aim to compute the most plausible estimates for
the time to extinction for a lineage of C. elegans that reproduces purely by self-ferilization, based on the standard
model of Muller's ratchet described elsewhere [12,6]. We
find that, for a wide range of biologically realistic parameters, Muller's ratchet would have led to extinction in the
known time of existence of the lineage leading to C. elegans. Several explanations could reconcile this result with
the persistence of this species: (i) nearly complete selfing
is a relatively recent innovation in the C. elegans lineage,
(ii) a low level of regular outcrossing has been crucial for
deleterious mutation elimination in this species history,
(iii) outcrossing activity might be concentrated in a few
populations that repeatedly give rise to many purely selfing lines that are then distributed around the world, (iv)
adaptive or compensatory mutations repair most of the
mutational damage, or (v) mutation rates in the wild are
much lower than indicated by current evidence. We argue
that scenario (i) is most plausible, and therefore propose
that the present-day extreme form of self-fertilization seen
in this species is likely to have originated relatively
recently in evolutionary time, perhaps facilitated or exacerbated by the loss of pheromone attraction between the
sexes [18]. However, it remains a formal possibility that
low levels of outcrossing, perhaps in combination with
other factors, might also play a role in the persistence of
self-fertile C. elegans populations.

Results
We estimated the time to extinction of a purely selfing
population due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations via Muller's ratchet, based on parameter values for C.
elegans. The genomic deleterious mutation rate, USDM, is
the key parameter, which we obtained by scaling estimates of the total genomic mutation rate, UTOT by fSDM,
the fraction of slightly deleterious mutations. From USDM
we infer the rate of deleterious mutation accumulation
and extrapolate it to the expected extinction times using
estimates of C. elegans reproductive capacity and generation time. To infer the rate of mutation accumulation we
use analytical approximations [19-21,6], global computing simulations [6,22] and an appropriate scaling of the
key parameters to accommodate a distribution of mutational effects [6,12]. In order to account for the fact that C.
elegans is selfing and not truly asexual, we also applied a
simple transformation to double the magnitude of heterozygous mutational effects, although this has little consequence for our conclusions [12] as the distribution of
mutational effects is very wide on a log-scale [23,24]. To
visualize the results, we use the U-shaped plot of extinction time as a function of the selection coefficient against
deleterious mutations (s), to characterize the range of crit-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:125

ical selection coefficients sc between which extinction is
expected to occur in a given interval of time [6,9]. This
critical range of selection coefficients corresponds to the
class of deleterious mutations that are sufficiently weak
that they can accumulate, yet are strong enough to negatively impact fitness.
Nuclear genome
For the nuclear genome, the results show that C. elegans
cannot survive pure selfing for extended periods of time in
the absence of mitigating forces, across most plausible
parameter combinations (Figure 1). For example, considering USDM = 0.5, a value that might closely reflect the true
haploid genomic deleterious mutation rate (see Methods), we expect an extinction time of less than 10 Kyr (~6
× 104 generations, assuming an average 60 day generation
time in nature) for a range of critical selection coefficients
sc between about 0.0003 and 0.09. Even in the absence of
precise estimates of the distribution of deleterious mutational effects on fitness (DDME) in C. elegans, we can be
certain that a substantial fraction of all deleterious mutations will have effects in that range [23,24]. This assumption is confirmed by our point estimate of the DDME (see
below), which suggests that fSDM = 51% of all mutations
have effects between s = 0.0003 and 0.09. Generation time
exerts a linear effect on the expected extinction time, so
the contribution of uncertainty in this life history character does not qualitatively alter the principal conclusion
(Figure 1). Maximal reproductive output Rmax enters only
as its log in the computation of extinction time. Consequently, even large changes to Rmax cause only minimal
changes in extinction time, rendering our results robust to
this parameter, as well. The effective population size Ne
can have a large effect on the operation of the ratchet, but
only for the minority of mutations with effects that are
very close to the 'wall of background selection' and would
be eliminated deterministically by selection; because we
simulate the whole range of realistic Ne values, our results
are robust in this regard as well. In general, the conclusion
that C. elegans cannot persist over extended periods of
evolutionary time in a purely selfing state is robust to
uncertainty in s and other parameters.
Mitochondrial genome
The results for the mitochondrial genome in C. elegans are
less dire (Figure 2). The parameter values that are most
plausible yield extinction times close to the estimated age
of common ancestry with related species (~18 Myr). Thus,
the genomic decay of C. elegans mitochondria is not
strongly implicated as an important factor limiting the
persistence of this species since its divergence with sister
taxa. Although we know of no evidence for or against the
presence of mitochondrial recombination in C. elegans,
despite examples from other nematodes [25,26], such a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/125

phenomenon would only reduce the potential for
Muller's ratchet to operate in mitochondria.

Discussion
These results indicate either that a predominantly selfing
mode of reproduction is a recent innovation in the C. elegans lineage or that compensatory mutation and/or regular bouts of outcrossing contribute to species persistence.
For the most plausible estimates of the nuclear deleterious
mutation rate we conclude that Muller's ratchet would
have led to extinction within thousands of years (tens or
hundreds of thousands of generations). More generally,
current knowledge about mutation rates and the distribution of deleterious mutational effects (DDME) cannot be
reconciled easily with extinction times of more than a million years in the absence of outcrossing.
Segregation in selfers
Previous work has shown that the segregation of deleterious mutations that occurs during meiosis can reduce the
rate of mutation accumulation [27]. The same is true for
asexual species that experience mitotic recombination
[28,12]. Because recombination can stop Muller's ratchet
[11,29], one might argue that segregation in selfers could
be sufficient to halt Muller's ratchet. However, existing
theory shows that this would be true only if all mutations
have effects of a specific size such that their doubling will
shift them into the domain of background selection and
thus prevent their accumulation [10-12]. This is not likely
to stop Muller's ratchet if there is a broad, continuous distribution of deleterious mutational effects, as is most
compatible with our present understanding. If our analysis is corrected for the maximal recombinational repair
that can come from free recombination within a selfer
[10-12], then it still indicates that Muller's ratchet continues to operate (to apply this correction we use the haploid
genomic mutation rate of USDM = 0.5 instead of the diploid rate of USDM = 1 in Figure 1). Thus purging of deleterious mutations by segregation in selfers is not expected to
stop Muller's ratchet here.
Outcrossing
Our analysis of Muller's ratchet assumes pure selfing, yet
population genetic studies have demonstrated that outcrossing does occur at low levels in C. elegans
[13,14,30,15,31,32]. However, recent evidence of outbreeding depression in C. elegans [33] and of changes in
multilocus haplotype frequencies over time in nature
[30], in which recombinants appear to suffer a fitness disadvantage, indicate that outcrossing and effective recombination are selected against, even if they occur within the
same population. In laboratory populations, males and
outcrossing are selected against, although elevated mutation rates and some genetic backgrounds partially mitigate this effect [34-38]. Furthermore, females of obligate

Analytical and simulation results combined. The solid, black horizontal line denotes the estimated divergence time of C. elegans
relative to its closest known outcrossing relatives (18 Myr), including upper and lower limits (grey lines; the upper limit of
about 100 Myr from some older studies is marked separately). Extinction time estimates below this line indicate that extinction
by Muller's ratchet is expected to have occurred, under a scenario of pure self-fertilization since divergence from known outcrossing sister taxa. The bar along the bottom labeled Nes = 1 indicates the boundary for selective neutrality of mutational
effects (for the range of Ne given in Table 1). Thick colored lines represent the analytic predictions of the extinction time for
different effective deleterious genomic mutation rates (Usdm) for Ne = 10 000, Tgen = 60 d, and Rmax = 280 offspring/generation.
Thin dashed lines demarcate bounds of uncertainty for Usdm = 0.5, based on upper and lower limits of Ne, Tgen and Rmax (Table
1); variability in extinction time is similar for other Usdm. Large symbols denote valid extinction time estimates from independent simulation runs with two or more observed clicks of Muller's ratchet. Small symbols denote lower limits for extinction
times from simulations without observed clicks, assuming that the ratchet would have clicked just after stopping the simulation.
This plot contains 36 393 simulations with a total of 19.9 years of computing time. The nearly vertical right portion of the
extinction time curves represents the "wall of background selection", indicating that mutations with larger effects are eliminated deterministically.

outcrossing sister species have a pheromone that is attractive to males of all related species, but this has been lost in
the selfing species C. elegans and C. briggsae [18], probably
impeding the potential for male C. elegans to successfully
locate and inseminate receptive mates in nature. Although
there is evidence of some form of attraction of males to
hermaphrodite-produced compounds in C. elegans
[39,40], it would appear to be substantially weaker than
in gonochoristic species [18]. Hermaphrodite C. elegans
are less likely to mate if self-sperm is present in their
reproductive tract [41]. Hermaphrodite C. elegans and C.
briggsae also fail to exhibit the mate searching exhibited by
females of related species [42,43] and hermaphrodites
lack the mating-immobility behaviour that is observed in
females of obligate outcrossing species [44], which will
further obstruct successful insemination by males in
nature.
These observations inform the potential for alternative
causes of population persistence to occur in the face of
deleterious mutation accumulation by Muller's ratchet: Is
selfing a recent innovation, and rare outcrossing irrelevant
to reducing the mutation load? Or, are the low levels of
outcrossing sufficient to prevent extinction even over long
evolutionary periods of time? Patterns of molecular evolution indicate that the reduction of effective population
size observed for selfing Caenorhabditis species is
unlikely to have occurred too distantly in the past [45].
The multiple genetic, behavioural, and physiological factors that reinforce selfing behaviour would also appear to
favor a recent origin of extreme selfing in C. elegans, but a
role for outcrossing in species persistence cannot be ruled
out at this point. We also note that a relatively recent origin for extreme self-fertilization does not preclude a
period of more moderate selfing rates in the history of
breeding system evolution in the lineage leading to C. elegans. However, the large number of factors that reinforce
selfing reproduction argue against a simple common transition from frequent outcrossing to highly selfing. Thus it
appears unlikely that a few outcrossing source populations of C. elegans ensure long-term species persistence by
continuously giving rise to many selfing lines that are
doomed to extinction once they stop outcrossing regularly.
Some degree of outcrossing in self-fertile species can be
sufficient to stop deleterious mutation accumulation from
Muller's ratchet [11,29]. However, existing simulation
results suggest that outcrossing rates of less than 1% do
not reduce the rate of mutation accumulation substantially [11,29]. Thus, further simulations of occasional outcrossing in C. elegans might not yield conclusions that
differ strongly from our results. Nevertheless, it is an
important, albeit non-trivial, next step to quantitatively
assess the potential impact of rare outcrossing events on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/125

expected extinction times, especially in combination with
other potentially mitigating factors like advantageous
mutation.
Distribution of deleterious mutational effects (DDME)
For our analysis we only consider the probability mass of
mutational effects in the critical range, fSDM (i.e. selection
coefficients are in the order(s) of magnitude where extinction times are critical, see Methods). This approach is
independent of any particular distribution and can be easily adapted to new findings. At the beginning of this study
we had no direct estimates of the DDME in C. elegans.
Thus we assumed that a broad range of fitness effects are
introduced by mutation, as found for Drosophila and
many other taxa [23,46,24]. The DDME should also partly
be reflected in the distribution of protein divergence values as a result of variable evolutionary constraint among
loci (see the nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence
ratio KA/KS [47]). The wide distribution of KA/KS values
between C. elegans and C. briggsae suggests an equally
wide DDME (Figure 3), assuming equal mutational effects
within a gene (variable intra-locus mutational effects will
cause the true DDME to be even more wide). The results
of Estes et al. [48] also suggest that a class of mutations
exists with deleterious effects of such a size that they are
not efficiently purged, and could accumulate over time
[49]. Thus, our approach appears sensible in assuming a
broad, continuous distribution of mutational effects.

The assumption of a very wide DDME is supported by
point estimates of the DDME in C. elegans that were
obtained after completing the main part of our analysis.
We used a recently developed method to estimate the
DDME from nucleotide diversity data of two species (C.
elegans and C. remanei) that exhibit strikingly different Ne
[23,50]. This method was applied to 730 Kbp of shotgun
sequencing-based diversity data from four wild strains of
C. elegans that were compared to the genome sequence of
Bristol N2 [51] and diversity data from 40 X-linked loci in
C. remanei [52]. The point estimate for the resulting
DDME can be seen in Figure 4. It predicts that fSDM = 32%
of all non-synonymous mutations will have effects
between s = 0.001 and 0.05. Additional work is required
to verify the robustness of this point estimate of the
Caenorhabditis DDME.
If one were to assume that the DDME of insertions and
deletions would result in their deterministic removal by
purifying selection, then limiting U to the single nucleotide mutation rate (USDM~0.2 vs. 0.5) would result in a
somewhat longer expected time to extinction. We would
nevertheless still expect extinction of a purely selfing lineage within hundreds of thousands of generations (Figure
1). However, the observation of substantial copy number
variation in C. elegans [53] suggests that it is probably

most appropriate to apply a mutation rate calculation that
includes indels, as we have done.
Because Muller's ratchet leads to a higher rate of mutation
accumulation in selfers compared to outcrossers, one
might expect such a signature in the form of increased KA/
KS values in C. elegans, when compared to outcrossing sister species [54]. However, such a signature does not
appear to robustly describe a selfing versus outcrossing
dichotomy [55-57]. This could result from a lack of statistical power, because divergence at effectively neutral and
very strongly selected sites will be independent of selfing
rates, so only a fraction of sites would be affected. However, the absence of such a signature could also indicate
that selfing has a sufficiently recent origin that not enough
time has elapsed to accumulate detectable sequence differences.
Other factors
Even if C. elegans did not experience any outcrossing,
other processes might prolong its survival (see the more
comprehensive list in [6]). Several factors warrant further
attention.

Lower mutation rates
Many factors influence mutation rates [58]. Although the
evidence for the frequency of slightly deleterious mutations is quite robust compared to that in other species, it
is difficult to exclude categorically the possibility of lower
mutation rates in nature than inferred from the laboratory. However, the similar rates of fitness decline under
mutation accumulation for different strains of C. elegans
suggest that average mutation rates do not differ greatly
among strains with low transposable element loads [59].
Furthermore, one environmental variable, temperature,
does not appear to alter mutation rates substantially in
this species [60].
Compensatory and advantageous mutations
Mutation accumulation experiments have found that
compensatory mutations arise in C. elegans lines with
compromised fitness and that they can increase fitness
rapidly [61]. This kind of mutation can effectively compensate for fitness decay from Muller's ratchet [62] and
might be based on variability in quantitative trait loci
(QTL) that are not mechanistically related to the mutational damage that they compensate for. If long-term
mutation accumulation also degrades the ability for fit-

Methods for details.

ness increases at these QTLs, then our results still apply
(see also discussion of back mutations in [6]). Further
work is necessary to elucidate the nature of compensatory
mutations in C. elegans and a recent study demonstrated
that this is possible [63]. Advantageous mutations also are
powerful in stopping Muller's ratchet [64] and these cannot be distinguished from compensatory mutations in a
genome that already has experienced a substantial
amount of decay. Experimental evolution in viruses indicates that the beneficial mutation rate can increase as fitness declines [65], which could forestall extinction.
However, it remains to be seen whether such a phenomenon is general and could apply to eukaryotes such as C.
elegans.
Population structure
Natural populations of C. elegans show strong structure
[13,14,16,32], and metapopulation processes could be
important for shaping diversity. Here we assume that
these effects are accounted for by using an appropriately
scaled effective population size Ne that corrects for deviations from panmixis. There is reason to believe that
Muller's ratchet basically depends on Ne and that other
details of population structure can be neglected [66]. Thus
our conclusions should not be strongly affected by the
presence of structured populations per se in C. elegans.
One potential means by which population structure could
limit Muller's ratchet is if different demes experience very
different outcrossing rates, leading to differential persist-

ence of highly outcrossing demes. Inference from heterozygosity in different samples is suggestive of variable
outcrossing rates [15,14,30], although both local and global patterns of polymorphism and linkage disequilibrium
do not support high outcrossing rates over the long term
in this species [13]. The fact that several features of C. elegans biology are specific to the selfing life-style (see above)
further argues against the notion that there might be a
long-term core of outcrossing populations that facilitate
the survival of the species and that constantly produce the
selfing lines that are so readily observed. In addition, theory suggests that effective outcrossing rates of less than 1%
do not drastically reduce the rate of mutation accumulation [11,29], thus limiting the potential for transient
instances of elevated outcrossing to impact population
persistence.
Uncertainty in divergence dates
In concluding that extinction by Muller's ratchet under
pure selfing would occur in less time than has elapsed
since the common ancestor of C. elegans and its relatives,
we applied the divergence time estimates of Cutter [67].
These date estimates are 4- to 6-fold more recent than previous divergence time estimates that assumed a universal
molecular clock among mammals, insects, and nematodes [68,69], and consequently are conservative for our
analysis with respect to identifying a genomic decay paradox. Longer divergence times between species make it
even less likely that C. elegans could have persisted in a
purely selfing state for most of the time since divergence
with the Caenorhabditis common ancestor.
Mitochondrial DNA
We find that Muller's ratchet in mitochondrial DNA operates much slower than deleterious mutation accumulation in nuclear DNA, despite a higher per site mutation
rate and taking into account differences in mode of transmission. This is mainly due to the much smaller mutational target of the mitochondrial genome. As a
consequence, mutation load of the mitochondrial
genome is not expected to be the limiting factor in species
persistence for C. elegans. This finding may seem surprising in the light of recent results that found a substantial
rate of fitness decay in human mtDNA [6]. However, (i)
the shorter extinction times in human mtDNA are mostly
due to higher mutation rates, which are probably a consequence of longer generation times, (ii) comparing the
same mutation rates shows that absolute nematode
extinction times are a bit shorter, as expected from the
shorter generation time that makes C. elegans reach the
number of generations to extinction quicker, (iii) the
overwhelmingly faster speed of genomic decay in nuclear
DNA, rather than an absence of decay in mtDNA, makes
the mutational load in the nucleus the limiting factor.
This conclusion is also robust to the possibility of stronger

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:125

selection in mtDNA than in nuclear DNA, as our method
compares the shortest possible extinction times for all corresponding selection coefficients (stronger selection on
mtDNA than assumed will lead to even longer extinction
times).
C. briggsae
Populations of the sibling species of C. elegans, C. briggsae,
also contain a very high fraction of self-fertilizing hermaphrodites. In many respects, C. briggsae shares similar
life history characteristics with C. elegans, including levels
of polymorphism and linkage disequilibrium, outcrossing rate, generation time, and fecundity [70]. Phenotypic
assays of fitness in mutation accumulation lines suggest
that C. briggsae might experience a higher mutation rate
than C. elegans [59], although this observation has not yet
been confirmed with direct mutation detection. C.
briggsae shares a more recent common ancestor with the
obligately outbreeding sibling species C. sp. 5 (JU727)
than does C. elegans with any known sibling species, so in
C. briggsae we can place a more recent upper bound on the
time of persistence of self-fertilization (Tage). Sequence
divergence suggests that Tage for C. briggsae is roughly 14
My [67], which implies that this species probably also
experiences a genomic decay paradox with respect to
Muller's ratchet in the same sense as C. elegans. A deeper
sampling of species within the Caenorhabditis phylogeny
will help elucidate whether a predominantly selfing mode
of reproduction in C. elegans and C. briggsae arose recently
in their evolutionary history.

Conclusion
We find that C. elegans life history characteristics and evolutionary parameters are inconsistent with long-term survival as a complete selfer. Therefore, C. elegans' highly
selfing lifestyle likely evolved relatively recently in evolutionary time. Alternatively, outcrossing and other factors
have played a significant role in maintaining a tolerable
mutation load throughout its history. If deleterious mutations are accumulating by Muller's ratchet and C. elegans
is on its way to extinction, then the potential for compromised molecular biological phenomena should be taken
into consideration in the analysis of C. elegans genetics
and development.

Methods
Modeling extinction time due to Muller's Ratchet
We use the standard model of Muller's ratchet as
described in Loewe [6] to compute Tcl, the time between
two clicks of the ratchet, from the effective population size
Ne, the genomic deleterious mutation rate USDM, and the
selection coefficient against deleterious mutations s (positive s denote deleterious mutations). To account for
weaknesses in the various methods of computation, we
combine some of the best analytic approximations avail-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/125

able [19-21,6] with individual-based simulations that
were computed on the evolution@home global computing network [6,22]. We also rely on the theoretical work
described elsewhere [10-12] to apply these results that
were computed for asexuals to selfers. In short, this means
doubling selection coefficients (s → 2s) to account for the
improved power of selection in selfers and including deleterious mutations from the whole diploid genome (double mutation rate; USDM and s increases cancel out). This
makes the speed of Muller's ratchet in diploid selfers
equivalent to the speed in asexual haploids. To account
for the presence of a distribution of deleterious mutational effects, we use the appropriate approach as
described elsewhere [12,71]. Briefly, we estimate Ne under
background selection from diversity data and then use
exactly this Ne for our simulation, as it has been shown to
be appropriate for simulating Muller's ratchet in the presence of background selection without explicitly simulating background selection [12,71]. We ignore the longterm effects of effectively neutral mutations, as their combined potential for decreasing fitness is too small to be of
interest here. Then we scale the total genomic mutation
rate UTOT by fSDM, the fraction of slightly deleterious mutations that have critical selection coefficients as determined
in Figures 1 and 2 to obtain USDM. To compute extinction
times, we first compute Cmm, the number of clicks that are
needed for mutational meltdown from Cmm = log(1/Rmax)/
log (1 - s), where Rmax is the maximal reproductive capacity, s is positive for deleterious mutations and fitness is
assumed to be multiplicative as in Loewe [6]. The extinction time is then approximated by Tex = Cmm * Tcl * Tgen,
where Tgen is the absolute generation time.
C. elegans life history and evolutionary parameters
In order to calibrate the models and simulations, we collected relevant life history and evolutionary parameters
from the literature. Based on these parameter ranges, we
applied "best estimates" along with minimum and maximum values (Table 1) to the analytical and simulation
models of Muller's ratchet to calculate extinction time.
Potential nuclear and mitochondrial deleterious mutation rates span a wide range. To avoid overly crowded
plots, we included one range of values along with our
most plausible haploid nuclear deleterious mutation rate
(= 0.5, Figure 1) and another range of values with our
most plausible mitochondrial deleterious mutation rate
(= 0.001, Figure 2).
Population size
Effective population size (Ne) in C. elegans has been estimated from nuclear nucleotide, microsatellite, and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) diversities to
range between 1,000 and 100,000 [13,14,16,15]. The Ne
of mtDNA is expected to be equal to the nuclear value in
pure selfers [72]. This equalized Ne of mitochondrion and

nucleus, relative to the 4:1 expectation for a gonochoristic
or dioecious species, is due to (i) a doubling of the mitochondrial effective size because all hermaphrodites can
pass mtDNA to their offspring (i.e., lack of males) and (ii)
a halving of the nuclear effective size from selfing-induced
homozygosity [73,74]. These estimates can be used
directly in our simulations, as they are obtained under
background selection [71].
Maximal reproductive capacity (Rmax)
The reproductive output of selfing C. elegans is limited by
sperm production [75], and wild isolates vary relatively
little in this quantity [76]. Different strains of C. elegans
produce from an average of 187 to 353 self-progeny [76],
although mated individuals are capable of producing up
to 1000 offspring [77].
Generation length (Tgen)
The generation time of C. elegans in nature is the least
well-characterized parameter necessary for the extinction
time models. The observation that most animals isolated
from nature are found in the "enduring" dauer larval stage
suggests that a 2 day generation time with ad libidum food
conditions in the laboratory at 25°C is not typical of natural conditions. Dauer larvae can survive up to many
months [77] and mutations exist that extend the lifetime
of C. elegans considerably [78,79]. However, C. elegans
dauer larvae are unlikely to be able to survive the long
periods that anhydrobiotic species are capable of [80],
because of their unsheathed cuticle [81]. Thus a mean
generation time of 30 to 60 days may not be unreasonable. Furthermore, the lack of a long-lived dauer "seed
bank" in C. elegans implies that populations cannot be
reconstituted by quiescent stage larvae with a low mutation load.
Mutation rates
Estimates of the deleterious mutation rate (USDM) in C.
elegans have been calculated from observable phenotypic
declines in fitness in laboratory mutation accumulation

lines [82-84] as well as from the direct detection of
sequence changes in some of the same mutation accumulation lines [85,86]. Phenotypic estimates of USDM have
yielded values between 0.0026 and 0.025 deleterious
mutations/haploid genome/generation [82-84]. However, Davies et al. [87] suggest that these measures should
be adjusted upward 28-fold because approximately 96%
of deleterious mutations are undetectable experimentally,
a result that was corroborated with a different approach
[48]. Such a correction leads to values of 0.073 and 0.7,
respectively. Direct sequencing also suggests a value of
USDM that is about 30 times higher than the initial phenotypic estimate for the same lines [85]. We consider direct
sequencing to be more reliable here, as phenotypic mutation accumulation misses many small effects [87,48].
These effects would have an impact on evolutionary
timescales.
The total mutation rate UTOT at potentially deleterious
sites can be computed from the observable per base pair
mutation rate per generation, μ, and from the mutational
target size G. For mitochondria μmt = 1.6 × 10-7 /bp/generation including indels and 8.9 × 10-8 for point mutations
only [88] with G ≈ 10 Kbp [89]. For nuclear sites μnu = 2.1
× 10-8 /bp/generation including indels and 9.1 × 10-9 for
point mutations only [85]. There are ≈ 26 Mbp in all
exons of C. elegans [90]; this value has to be corrected,
since we are not interested in synonymous sites and there
are probably about three times more functional sites in
noncoding DNA than in coding DNA [91-94], suggesting
a total of G ≈ 70 Mbp functional sites per haploid genome.
This accords with recent assessments that ~70% of the
genome is functional [95]. Thus for the mitochondrial
genome UTOT ≈ 0.001/generation and for the haploid
nuclear genome UTOT ≈ 1.5/generation (including indels)
and UTOT ≈ 0.64/generation (point mutations only).
Distribution of deleterious mutational effects on fitness (DDME)
To estimate USDM we have to consider (i) the total mutation rate UTOT which is given by the frequency of molecu-

Page 10 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:125

lar changes of the DNA and (ii) the corresponding DDME.
Information about the DDME is important, because
Muller's ratchet would not operate if deleterious mutations all had effects large enough to be eliminated deterministically by selection. Alternatively, mutations could
accumulate by Muller's ratchet very rapidly, yet have no
effect on fitness, if all mutational effects were sufficiently
small. Consequently, we consider extinction time as a
function of the strength of selection to identify the range
of critical selection coefficients sc that could lead to extinction in a given time interval. We then integrate over all
mutational effects to estimate fSDM, the fraction of mutations that have deleterious effects in the range given by sc,
so that USDM = UTOT * fSDM. Although the DDME is largely
uncharacterized in C. elegans, we assume here that a substantial proportion of mutational effects are distributed
among all the orders of magnitude between lethality (s =
1) and s = 10-6. This assumption appears to be valid in
Drosophila, and is likely to be a reasonable approximation for most taxa [23,24]. Figure 3 can be interpreted as
to support this assumption, which uses the calculations of
the nonsynonymous to synonymous site divergence ratio
(KA/KS) between C. elegans and C. briggsae from Cutter &
Ward [96]. Using this approach it is difficult to see how
any particular critical selection coefficients could have
fSDM < 10% or fSDM > 50% of UTOT. Therefore, these
assumptions about USDM appear to be justified biologically. This approach is robust to the complicating effects
of background selection [71,97].
We also derived a rough point estimate of the DDME in
Caenorhabditis using a method that requires only estimates
of replacement (πa) and synonymous-site (πs) diversity
for two species [23,50]. We used estimates of polymorphism for C. elegans and C. remanei. For 40 X-linked loci
in C. remanei we use an average πa = 0.00102 and πs =
0.0350 [52]. Comparable measures for C. elegans are more
difficult to obtain, because most estimates of nucleotide
diversity identify too few replacement site polymorphisms to accurately estimate πa. Heuristically, we use the
data of Koch et al. [51] for this purpose, assuming that
their shotgun sequencing randomly sampled the genome
with respect to coding and noncoding sequences and that
no sequences from each of the 4 strains they sampled
overlapped with each other; thus providing a set of single
pairwise comparisons with the N2 strain. Using this logic,
we compute πa~0.000155 and πs ~ 0.000527 (22 replacement polymorphisms in 1.42 × 105 nonsynonymous
basepairs, 25 synonymous polymorphisms in 4.7 × 104
synonymous basepairs). The total number of synonymous and nonsynonymous basepairs was calculated
assuming that 26% of the 730 kb sequenced was exonic
and that 25% of exonic sites are synonymous, as in the
genomic average. We caution that these estimates for C.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/125

elegans are not ideal, although we expect that the relative
magnitude of πa to πs is reasonable.
Using an approach described elsewhere [23,50], briefly,
we fit lognormal DDME location and shape parameters to
the levels of diversity observed for both types of sites in
both species. For the above diversity values, μg = 3.86 × 104 and σ = 15.76, where μ is the geometric mean mutation
g
g
rate and σg is the geometric standard deviation. These
parameters reflect median central tendency and allow easy
computation of the boundaries that include 68% of all
probability mass (lower limit = μg/σg; upper limit = μg *
σg; μg = exp [arithmetic mean on the log-scale] = median;
σg = exp [normal standard deviation on the log-scale]; see
[98]). The resulting point estimate DDME (Figure 4) predicts credible frequencies of dominant lethal mutations if
one assumes that Caenorhabditis and Drosophila are
roughly similar in this respect [23]. Integrating the ranges
of selection coefficients from 10-2 to 0.1, 10-3 to 0.1, and
10-4 to 0.1 results in respective probability masses of fSDM
= 9.7%, 34% and 66%. These calculations lend empirical
support for the estimates compiled in Table 1.
Phylogenetic context
In order to place the extinction time estimates into a biological context for C. elegans, we use inferences of intraspecific coalescent times within C. elegans and divergence
times between C. elegans and its sister taxa. Using the
expected coalescent time for a sample of segregating polymorphisms, Cutter [13] calculated that extant nucleotide
polymorphism in this species likely coalesces roughly 60
Kya ago (= 4 Ne generations). Maximum persistence times
can be inferred from interspecific calculations of the time
to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA). Previous
estimates of TMRCA for C. elegans and its relatives suggested
that they diverged 80 – 110 Mya [69,68], although the use
of non-nematode calibration of the molecular clock
makes this divergence time almost surely a drastic overestimate [99,2]. Consequently, we prefer to use some recent
dates of divergence using internal calibration [67], which
suggest that C. elegans shared a most recent common
ancestor with its outcrossing sister clade approximately 18
Mya (range 5 – 30 Mya). Use of this more recent divergence time is conservative for our purposes as it minimizes the potential of falsely inferring that the expected
extinction time is shorter than lineage age.
