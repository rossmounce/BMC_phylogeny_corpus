Abstract
Background: Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is an important grain-legume crop that is mainly grown in rainfed areas,
where terminal drought is a major constraint to its productivity. We generated expressed sequence tags (ESTs) by
suppression subtraction hybridization (SSH) to identify differentially expressed genes in drought-tolerant and
-susceptible genotypes in chickpea.
Results: EST libraries were generated by SSH from root and shoot tissues of IC4958 (drought tolerant) and ICC
1882 (drought resistant) exposed to terminal drought conditions by the dry down method. SSH libraries were also
constructed by using 2 sets of bulks prepared from the RNA of root tissues from selected recombinant inbred lines
(RILs) (10 each) for the extreme high and low root biomass phenotype. A total of 3062 unigenes (638 contigs and
2424 singletons), 51.4% of which were novel in chickpea, were derived by cluster assembly and sequence
alignment of 5949 ESTs. Only 2185 (71%) unigenes showed significant BLASTX similarity (<1E-06) in the NCBI nonredundant (nr) database. Gene ontology functional classification terms (BLASTX results and GO term), were
retrieved for 2006 (92.0%) sequences, and 656 sequences were further annotated with 812 Enzyme Commission
(EC) codes and were mapped to 108 different KEGG pathways. In addition, expression status of 830 unigenes in
response to terminal drought stress was evaluated using macro-array (dot blots). The expression of few selected
genes was validated by northern blotting and quantitative real-time PCR assay.
Conclusion: Our study compares not only genes that are up- and down-regulated in a drought-tolerant genotype
under terminal drought stress and a drought susceptible genotype but also between the bulks of the selected RILs
exhibiting extreme phenotypes. More than 50% of the genes identified have been shown to be associated with
drought stress in chickpea for the first time. This study not only serves as resource for marker discovery, but can provide
a better insight into the selection of candidate genes (both up- and downregulated) associated with drought tolerance.
These results can be used to identify suitable targets for manipulating the drought-tolerance trait in chickpea.

Background
Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), the fourth most important grain-legume crop, is grown in more than 45 countries, mostly in arid and semiarid zones. Approximately
90% of the crop is grown under rainfed conditions,
wherein yield is significantly affected by abiotic stresses

such as drought, heat, and cold [1-3]. Drought-related
yield losses can occur in 40%-60% of the total chickpea
production [4]. Terminal drought, which occurs at the
pod filling and seed-developing stage of the crop and
increases in severity at the end of the season, is a major
constraint to chickpea production [1,5,6]. The identification of differentially expressed genes between 2 genotypes differing in drought tolerance and a set of their
progenies can therefore be an important indicator of
drought-associated genes in chickpea.

Functional genomics approaches have been used in
recent years to understand the stress-responsive
mechanism in plants. Candidate genes involved in
drought tolerance mechanisms have been identified,
characterized, and assessed for their comparative transcriptional activity by using whole-genome sequencing
or expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries. Several functional genomics studies have been performed in chickpea to identify the abiotic stress-responsive transcripts
by approaches such as suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH), Super serial analysis of gene expression
(SuperSAGE), microarray, and EST sequencing [7-9].
Additional file 1 summarizes results of previous studies
on identifying ESTs associated with drought stress in
chickpea.
SSH has been widely used to compare patterns of
gene expression in tissues under different conditions.
However, it has not yet been used to identify differentially expressed transcripts (both up- and downregulated) in chickpea in response to drought stress at the
flowering stage of plants. In all earlier studies, except
the one by Varshney et al. [9], water stress was imposed
by either completely withdrawing water or allowing
uprooted young seedlings to wilt at room temperature.
However, under field conditions, water stress progresses
gradually and a similar type of stress is simulated in the
laboratory by the “dry down experiment,” which allows
comparison of different genotypes and their response
toward drought [10]. Moreover, stress response of a
plant at the seedling stage can be very different from
that at the reproductive stage, the latter being an important and yield-determining stage in chickpea.
In the present study, we constructed several reciprocal
SSH libraries by using drought-tolerant and -susceptible
genotypes as well as extreme recombinant inbred lines
(RILs) for the high root biomass (HRB) and low root
biomass (LRB) under terminal drought stress. This
approach differs from that used in earlier studies in the
following aspects: (1) use of 2 chickpea genotypes differing in their drought-tolerance capacity and their RIL
progenies; (2) drought stress imposed at the flowering
stage in a gradual manner by the dry down method; (3)
plant samples analyzed when each plant experienced the
same amount of stress, as judged by their transpiration
ratio; and (4) reciprocal subtraction of transcripts by
using control and stress conditions as well as susceptible
and tolerant genotypes to enable a good comparison and
identify both up- and downregulated genes. Thus, the
EST set we used is novel and represents genes that are
up and downregulated in response to terminal drought
stress, and can thereby help several genes that have not
been shown to be previously associated with drought
stress in chickpea. The differentially expressed ESTs

were analyzed using macro-array, northern blotting, and
quantitative PCR.

Methods
Plant Material

The drought-tolerant characteristics of chickpea line
ICC 4958 and drought-susceptible characteristics of ICC
1882 have been attributed to their large and prolific and
small root system, respectively. An RIL mapping population (264 RILs) of ICC 4958 (large root) and ICC 1882
(small root) has been developed and phenotyped at the
International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid
Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru (17° 30’ N; 78° 16’ E;
altitude 549 m). The root phenotyping experiment was
conducted in PVC cylinders with 18 cm diameter and
120 cm height, filled with soil-sand mixture in open
field conditions. Plants were sampled at 35 days after
sowing and different measurements were recorded as
described by Kashiwagi et al. [11]. Ten RILs for extreme
phenotype of high root biomass and low root biomass
were selected on the basis of phenotypic evolution
[Varshney et al. unpublished] to prepare bulk cDNA
SSH libraries.
Stress treatment
Dry down procedure

Dry down, a gradual and progressive water deficit stress,
was given to plants [10]. Experiments were conducted in
triplicate in a glass house receiving natural solar radiation, with air temperature regulated between 23°C and
28°C (night/day). Seeds of ICC 4958, ICC 1882, 10 RILs
each for HRB and LRB, were sown in plastic pots of 8in. diameter. Water stress (WS) treatment was initiated
35 days after the emergence of plants. All pots were
saturated with water and left overnight to drain excess
water. Next day, the surfaces of pots were covered with
plastic beads to prevent water loss through the soil surface. Weight (in g) of individual pots was recorded daily
in the morning at approximately 10.30 h. Daily loss of
water through transpiration was calculated as the difference in pot weight on the current day from that on the
previous day. Control plants were maintained at
approximately 80% field capacity by daily compensation
of water loss due to transpiration. To expose WS plants
to a progressive water deficit, they were allowed to lose
a maximum of 80 g of water per day; any additional loss
was compensated by adding water to the pots. The transpiration of each plant was then calculated as the difference in its weight on successive days, plus water added
on the previous day. Transpiration data were analyzed
as described previously [10]. Well watered (WW) pots
were maintained at a normalized transpiration ratio
(NTR) value of 1 and WS treatment was continued until

Deokar et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:70
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/70

the ratio of the transpiration of the stressed plant to the
average transpiration of WW plants reached ≤0.1, that
is, when the transpiration of WS plants was <1% of the
WW plants, a stage defined as the endpoint for the
water deficit treatment [10]. WS plants reached this
stage in 10 to13 day of initiation of stress treatment. At
this stage, shoot and the root tissues from WW and WS
plants were separately harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C for RNA extraction.
RNA and mRNA isolation

Total RNA was isolated by using the Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and mRNA was further isolated by using the PolyATract mRNA Isolation System
(Promega, Madison, WI). To construct bulk libraries,
equal amounts of total RNA (100 μg from each RIL) isolated from 10 RILs of extreme HRB and 10 RILs of
extreme LRB were pooled separately and used for
mRNA isolation.
Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH)

To isolate genotype and tissue-specific transcripts
related to drought, 3 subtraction strategies were
employed (Figure 1). In the first strategy, forward subtraction was carried out by subtracting the cDNA of
WW ICC 4958 root tissue from that of the WS ICC

Page 3 of 20

4958 root tissue to isolate differentially upregulated
genes in roots under drought stress. Reverse subtraction
was performed to isolate downregulated genes under
drought stress. Similarly, forward and reverse subtractive
libraries were made from the shoot tissue. In the second
strategy, reciprocal subtraction of cDNA from root tissue of ICC 4958 and ICC 1882, both receiving WS
treatment, was performed to isolate differentially
expressed genes in the genotypes. In the third approach,
cDNA from 10 RILs, each showing extreme phenotype
for HRB and LRB for reciprocal subtraction, was used
to isolate drought-associated differentially expressed
genes in RILs exhibiting extreme root biomass
phenotype.
Subtractive libraries were constructed by using the
Clontech PCR-Select™ cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech,
Palo Alto, CA), starting with 2 μg of mRNA from tester
and drivers samples. Table 1 lists the testers and drivers
used to construct 8 different SSH libraries. Forward and
reverse subtraction was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions to identify the transcript enriched
in one sample relative to the other. Subtracted cDNAs
were purified by the MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and ligated into a pGEM-T easy vector (Promega). Ligated plasmid DNAs were used for
transformation into competent E. coli strain DH5a.

Figure 1 Schematic details about the SSH libraries. Two chickpea genotype (ICC 4958- HRB, drought resistant and ICC 1882-LRB, drought
susceptible cultivar) and 10 extreme recombined inbreed lines each of HRB and LRB phenotype derived from ICC 4958 × ICC 1882 mapping
population were used for construction of eight cDNA SSH libraries. Both forward (FS) and reverse subtractions (RS) were generated using
reciprocal samples.

Positive clones were selected on an Ampicillin/IPTG/XGal LB plate. Plasmid DNA from positive clones were
isolated by using REAL 96 plasmid isolation kit (Qiagen), and purified DNA was used for single-pass Sanger
sequencing by using T7/SP6/M13F universal sequencing
primers.
Sequence processing

All sequences were checked for quality and then analyzed by Seqman™ II 5.08 (DNASTAR, Inc.. Lasergene
Gene Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI) to detect and
remove pGEMT-Easy vector sequences. A Perl script
EST trimmer [12] was used to trim adaptors, poly A/T
ends. EST sequences which were less than 100 bp long
were removed. Manual sequence processing was also
performed to confirm results. ESTs from individual
libraries were assembled into contigs, using default parameters of CAP3 [13]. Incorporation of ESTs into a contig required at least 95% sequence identity and a
minimum 40-bp overlap. ESTs from all 8 libraries also
underwent CAP3 analysis to produce a differentially
expressed unigene dataset.
Sequence annotation

The NCBI BLAST program [14] version 2.2.6 was used
to perform BLASTN and BLASTX similarity searches.
BLASTN analysis was performed to determine
sequence homology at the nucleotide level of this unigenes set with EST databases of Medicago truncatula,
Glycine max, Lotus japonicus, and Phaseous vulgaris
and also with ESTs of model plant species such
as Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, and Populus
alba downloaded from NCBI. The cutoff expectation

(E)-value threshold for BLASTN searches was ≤1e-5.
BLASTX was performed against NCBI non-redundant
(nr) database using Blast2GO with an E-value cutoff of
<1e-06.
Functional categorization and GO enrichment analysis

Functional annotation was performed by using Blast2GO
(version 2.2.3) [15], following the standard procedure of
BLASTX for unigenes dataset (parameters: nr database,
high scoring segment pair (HSP) cutoff length 33, report
20 hits, maximum E-value 1.0E-3), followed by mapping
and annotation (parameters: E-value hit filter 1.0E-6,
annotation cutoff 55, GO weight 5, HSP-hit coverage cutoff 20). GO terms were summarized according to their
molecular functions, biologic processes, and cellular
components. Enzyme mapping of annotated sequences
was performed by using direct GO to Enzyme mapping
and used to query the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) to define the KEGG orthologs (KOs).
These KOs were then plotted into the whole metabolic
atlas by using the KEGG mapping tool [16].
GO enrichment analysis was performed by using the
Fisher exact test, as implemented in the GOSSIP module
[17] integrated in Blast2GO package. For GO enrichment
analysis, all GO terms with a cut-off threshold of pFDR(p)
≤ 0.05 were considered differentially enriched between 2
set of EST libraries. To study the genotype-specific
response for ICC 4958 and ICC 1882 under drought
stress, GO enrichment analysis was performed between
ESTs developed from the SSH libraries AB1-1 and AB2-1,
which were constructed to identify transcripts induced in
response to drought in the tolerant genotype ICC 4958
and the susceptible genotype ICC 1882, respectively.

Macroarray and Northern Hybridization

To screen the differentially expressed ESTs identified in
present work, two different macroarray experiments
were conducted. In the first experiment, a nylon macroarray in 96-well format, using unigenes from AS1-1 and
AS2-1 libraries, was constructed and total RNA from
WW and WS plants of ICC 4958 were used to evaluate
the differentially expressed unigenes under water
stressed condition. Where as in second experiment, a
nylon macroarray in a 96-well format, using unigenes
from AB1-1 and AB2-1 libraries, was constructed and
total RNA from water-stressed ICC 4958 and ICC 1882
were used to evaluate the genotype-specific response
under water stress condition.
Equal amounts of purified PCR amplified products
(100 ng) was spotted onto nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), using the
dot-blot apparatus in 96 formats. Each blot was prepared in duplicate. PCR-amplified products of actin
cDNA (GenBank: EU529707) as a housekeeping gene
for normalization of the signals between the blots and
neomycin phosphotransferase (NPTII) as a negative control for signal background correction were spotted on
the membrane and cross-linked using UV. RNA samples
were labeled during first-strand cDNA synthesis. Total
RNA (5 μg ) was reverse transcribed, using SuperScript
III RT enzyme (Superscript II, Life Technologies, Grand
Islands, NY) in the presence of a-[32P] dCTP and used
as probes. The nylon membrane were prehybridized
with formamide hybridization buffer for 42°C for 6 h,
the denatured probe was added, and hybridized for 24
h. Washed membranes were exposed to X-ray film
(BIOMAX MR Film, Kodak) and developed after 7 days
of incubation at -80°C. The image of the developed film
was acquired by SYNGENE-G-Box gel documentation
and analysis system (Syngene, Synoptics Ltd, Cambridge,
UK) and signal intensity of each spot was calculated by
the Gene tool software. Transcript levels for each unigenes were calculated as the average intensity from triplicate experiments. The intensity of each spot was
normalized with respect to the intensity of actin gene.
Change in level of expression was expressed as the
expression ratio of normalized signal intensities of
respective unigenes in control versus treatments. On the
basis of macroarray results, genes exhibiting significant
induction were validated by Northern blotting.
For northern blotting total RNA (20 μg) from WW and
WS plants was separated by electrophoresis on a 1.2% FA
agarose gel and transferred to an Immobilon™-Ny+
membrane (Millipore, USA) following the method of
Sambrook et al. [18]. PCR-amplified individual cDNA
fragments (amplified with M13 forward and reverse
universal sequencing primers) were purified from the
agarose gel and used as probes. cDNA-amplified actin

Page 5 of 20

(EU529707) was the housekeeping gene control. Probes
were labeled with a32P-dCTP, using the DecaLabel™
DNA labeling kit (Fermentas Life Sciences). Northern
blots were scanned using a PharosFx Plus PhosphorImager (Biorad).
Quantitative real-time RT PCR

PCR primers for quantitative real-time PCR were
designed with the parameters of optimum primer GC
content of 50%, primer T m > 55-65°C, primer length
18-30 nucleotides, and an expected amplicon size of
80-200 bp (see additional file 2 for primer sequences).
SYBR green qPCR was performed in 96-well plates,
using the Stratagene Mx3000P system and SYBR FAST
qPCR Master Mix (2x) Universal (KAPA Biosystems).
All qPCR reactions were run in triplicates with a notemplate control to check for contaminations. PCR was
conducted under the following conditions: 3 min at
95°C (enzyme activation), 40 cycles each of 3 sec at 95°
C (denaturation) and 30 s at 60°C (anneal/extend).
Finally, a melting curve analysis was performed from
65° to 95°C in increments of 0.5°C, each lasting 5 s, to
confirm the presence of a single product and absence of
primer-dimers. Two internal controls GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, AJ010224) and
HSP90 (GR406804) were used to normalize the variations
in cDNA samples [19]. Fold changes were calculated by
the 2-δδCt method [20].

Results and discussion
Water stress treatment

A graph of NTR values of ICC 4958, ICC 1882, and 20
RILs during the stress treatment indicates that all parental lines and RILs experienced same degree of stress
(Additional file 3). The dry down procedure to impose
water stress in pot experiments has been successfully
employed in various plant systems, including chickpea
[21-25].
Considering that terminal drought is a major constraint in achieving optimal crop yields in chickpea, all
experiments were conducted at the flowering stage to
identify molecular responses of chickpea under water
stress. In many functional genomics studies on drought
response in chickpea, drought stress has been induced
by withdrawing water supply or by uprooting seedlings
and allowing them to wilt at room temperature [26-28].
However, the physiologic and molecular responses to
these treatments are likely to be different from those
experienced by the plant during natural terminal
drought conditions, wherein drought stress is gradual
and allows the plant to go through various stages of
adaptation. Another major limitation of all these studies
is the variation in the quantum of stress experienced by
different plants. Depending on their genotype as well as

Deokar et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:70
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/70

environmental and experimental conditions, plants
experience varying degrees of stress when water is withdrawn or they are allowed to wilt for a specified duration. In our study, we sampled ICC 4958 and ICC 1882
and 20 RILs at a stage when they undergo the same
degree of stress, as determined by the transpiration
ratio.

using SuperSAGE and high-throughput 454 sequencing
has generated 17,493 unique 26-bp tags (SAGE UniTags) from roots of the drought-tolerant chickpea variety ICC 588 [7]. However, absence of a reference
sequence for chickpea and the short read length of
sequences (26-bp) limit the utility of this approach.
EST assembly

cDNA SSH libraries

A total of 6432 clones were generated from the 8 SSH
libraries, of which 6053 ESTs were sequenced. After a
quality check, 5494 high-quality ESTs were obtained
(Table 1). Four SSH libraries were constructed from
resistance parent ICC 4958. In total, 2034 upregulated
and 1620 downregulated ESTs were identified: 753 upregulated ESTs from library AS1-1 (shoot tissue) and 1281
from AR1-1 (root tissue), and 821 downregulated ESTs
from AS2-1 (shoot tissue) and 799 from AR2-1 (root tissue). In addition, 2 reciprocal libraries were constructed
using root tissues of ICC 4958 and ICC 1882: there
were 503 upregulated ESTs from AB1-1 in ICC 4958
and 529 uprgulated ESTs from AB2-1 in ICC 1882.
Furthermore, 400 ESTs were generated from library
Bulk1-1 (constructed from the bulk of 10 extreme RILs
for HRB) and 408 from library Bulk2-1 (constructed
from 10 extreme RILs for LRB).
In chickpea, root growth, osmotic adjustment, and
stem reserve utilization are associated with drought tolerance. Root traits such as biomass, length, density, and
depth have been proposed as drought-avoidance traits
under terminal drought conditions [29,30]. Roots are
considered a primary site for stress signal perception,
where a signaling mechanism cascade initiates gene
expression in response to drought stress. These transcriptional changes can result in successful adaptations,
protecting plants against environmental stress [31]. The
differentially expressed ESTs identified in our study provide a list of gene regulated in response to terminal
drought stress in root tissue of chickpea.
The SSH strategy can be used as an alternative and
complementary transcript profiling tool to the GeneChip
microarrays, especially to identify novel genes and transcripts present in low abundance [32]. Thus, the SSH
technology will have more utility in a system where genome sequence information and microarray chip are not
available for transcript profiling.
In 2001, 47 ESTs up- or downregulated by water
stress were first identified in chickpea [33]. cDNA
libraries from a drought-responsive genotype in chickpea were constructed and differentially expressed ESTs
were identified using in silico approach [9,34]. SSH
libraries have been constructed from chickpea seedling
after dehydration stress [27,35] and between root tissue
of 2 chickpea cultivars [36]. Transcriptome analysis by

A total 5494 high-quality sequences (average length 505
bp) were generated after removing short and low-quality
sequences. A total of 3062 unigenes (638 contigs and
2424 singletons) were derived from cluster assembly and
sequence alignment; each contig had 2-113 ESTs with
an average length of the 527 bp. The majority of contigs
(84.9%) contained 5 or fewer ESTs, whereas only 2.97%
contigs were made from 20 or more ESTs (Additional
file 4), indicating a high degree of normalization and
subtraction efficiency. All EST sequences have been
deposited in the dbEST division of GenBank
(HO062174-HO068058). The unigene (UG) set developed in this study is henceforth referred to as UG-TDS
(unigenes responsive to terminal drought stress). CAP3
assembly analysis of our datasets with all chickpea EST
sequences (34,587) deposited in NCBI dbESTs identified
1576 unigenes (51.4% of total unigenes) as singlets and
are new entries to the chickpea database.
ESTs from forward and reverse libraries were aligned
to identify unique ESTs, which were up- or downregulated (in silico subtraction). There were 592 unigenes
specific to forward-subtracted libraries and 876 unigenes
to reverse-subtracted libraries. Although 125 assemblies
contained ESTs from both forward and reverse libraries,
this indicates very low level of redundancy between both
libraries (Figure 2). ESTs identified in bulk libraries and
from individual parent libraries were also aligned using
CAP3 assembly, assuming that the high number of ESTs
from the HRB-contributing parent ICC 4958 and bulks
of RILs of the extreme HRB phenotype would form a
cluster. Surprisingly, only 20 ESTs were common
between ICC 4958 ESTs and bulks of RILs exhibiting
HRB. Similarly, only 7 ESTs were common for ICC
1882-specific transcripts (the LRB-contributing parent in
the mapping population) and the transcripts from bulks
of RILs exhibiting extremes of LRB phenotype.
To determine the efficiency of normalization and subtraction of SSH libraries, we compared our ESTs with
those generated by using non-normalized cDNA
libraries. We have previously reported more than 20,000
chickpea root ESTs in response to drought and salt
stress in ICC 4958 by using the same procedure to
obtain tissue samples for constructing the libraries [9].
CAP3 assembly and clustering analysis of ESTs identified 126 contigs with 1 EST from our SSH libraries and
more than 5 ESTs from non-normalized libraries. Some

Figure 2 Venn diagram representing comparison of ESTs from different SSH libraries: (A) Cap3 assembly of four SSH libraries AS1-1
(forward subtracted library from the shoots of drought tolerant genotype, ICC 4958), AR1-1(forward subtracted library from the roots of drought
tolerant genotype, ICC 4958), containing up- regulated transcripts and AS2-1(reverse subtracted library from the shoots of drought tolerant
genotype, ICC 4958), AR2-1(reverse subtracted library from the roots of drought tolerant genotype, ICC 4958) containing down regulated
transcripts under TDS, reveals a set of 592 and 876unigenes specific to up- regulated and, down regulated libraries respectively. A set of 125
unigenes were common in both group. (B) ESTs obtained from bulk of RILs libraries Bulk 1-1(forward subtracted library from the roots of HRB
and LRB) and Bulk 2-1(reverse subtracted library from the roots of HRB and LRB) and individual parental libraries, AB1-1 (forward subtracted
library from the roots of ICC 4958 and ICC 1882)and AB2-1(reverse subtracted library from the roots of ICC 4958 and ICC 1882 ) reveals 343, 399,
262 and 298 unigenes specific to AB1-1, AB2-1, Bulk 1-1 and Bulk2-1 libraries, respectively.

ESTs such as HO063066 (pathogenesis-related protein),
HO063205 (plasma membrane intrinsic protein), and
HO067852 (Type 1 metallothionein), had single representations in SSH libraries, whereas more than 60 clones
were present in non-normalized cDNA libraries. These
results support the utility and efficacy of our SSH
approach to reduce the redundancy and identify specific
transcripts with small-scale sequencing. Dataset analysis
with all chickpea EST sequences (34,587) deposited in
NCBI dbESTs identified 1576 new unigenes (51.4% of
the total unigenes).

EST collection is smaller (1,83,153) than those of other
species such as soybean (8,80,561) and Medicago
(1,58,131). The low nucleotide similarity observed
between chickpea and other plant species does not necessarily represent phylogenetic relationships, but could
depend on the coverage of EST sequences. A significant
percentage of unigenes (14.6-47.5%) showing weak or no
similarity (E-value >1E-05) for Medicago, Glycine, Lotus,
and Phaseolus, indicating a considerable divergence in
chickpea gene content within other leguminous species.

Nucleotide-level diversity analysis

Functional characterization of the chickpea unigene
dataset

BLASTN analysis of UG-TDS revealed significant identity with Medicago (79.0%), followed by Glycine max
(72.0%), Phaseolus (53.7%), Lotus (53.4%), Populus
(43.6%), Arabidopsis (29.4%), and Oryza sativa (28.5%)
ESTs (Figure 3; additional file 5). Analysis of sequence
similarity of chickpea UG-TDS with other legume species
revealed that 2614 (85%) unigenes had significant similarity to ESTs of at least one of the analyzed legume species,
with highest similarity of chickpea unigenes with
Medicago, which is closely related to chickpea in the phylogenetic tree [37]. As expected, the 4 leguminous species
showed the highest levels of similarity. The low level of
sequence similarity for L. japonicus may be because of its

BLASTX analysis of 3062 unigenes showed 2185 total hits
against NCBI non-redundant (nr) database with E value
<1E-06. A majority (1.210; 55%) of top matches were
from proteins of legume species, with maximum hits from
Glycine max (528, 24% unigenes) and Medicago truncatula
(338, 15% unigenes); only 6% (132 unigenes) matched with
Cicer arietinum, indicating the novelty of the chickpea unigenes dataset. Among nonlegume species, majority of
matches were with proteins of Vitis vinifera (275, 12% unigenes), Ricinus communis (214, 9% unigenes) and Populus
trichocarpa (212, 9% unigenes). The availability of the
whole genome and predicted proteins of these species and
limited sequence information of legumes in the database

may have led to the highest homology of chickpea
sequences with these nonlegume genomes (Additional file
6). Functional annotation of unigenes by Blast2GO resulted
in gene ontology functional classification terms for 2006
(92.0%) sequences, of which 1813 (90.3%) unigenes were
functionally annotated (GO consensus and EC number)
and 193 sequences were mapped but not annotated (Figure
4). At the second level GO, 1375 sequences were assigned
to the biologic process category, 1422 sequences to the
molecular function category, and 1311 sequences to the
cellular component category (Figure 5). In biologic processes, “cellular process” and “metabolic process” was the
most dominant term (27.2% of sequences), followed by
“metabolic processes” (27.0%). In the molecular function
category, “binding” (41.8%) was the most dominant term,
followed by “catalytic activity” (36.6%); in the cellular
compartments category, “cell part” (42.91%) was the most
represented term, followed by “membrane-bounded organelle” (29.34%) and “organelle part” (10.04%). Additional
file 7 gives details on GO analyses of UG-TDS sets.
Pathway classification of transcripts

Of the 1808 annotated sequences, 656 were annotated
with 812 Enzyme Commission (EC) codes and mapped
to 108 different KEGG pathways. Of the 108 pathways
contained within the metabolism category (metabolic
pathways), 46 were represented by 43.44% of the 656
unigenes. KEGG metabolic pathways well represented

by unigenes were biosynthesis of plant hormones
(44 enzymes), biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids
(29 enzymes) and terpenoids and steroids (24 enzymes),
biosynthesis of alkaloids derived from histidine and purine (25 enzymes) and from the shikimate pathway
(24 enzymes), starch and sucrose metabolism (24
enzymes), and arginine and proline metabolism
(10 enzymes). Several hormone pathways, such as of
abscisic acid, ethylene, salicylic acid, and jasmonic acid,
are involved in one or more environmental stresses,
including drought stress and other abiotic stresses processes [38-42]. A representative KEGG map for biosynthesis of plant hormones is given in Additional file 8.
Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis

Identification of overrepresented and underrepresented
GO terms from a given list of genes from different
libraries may help elucidate the functional relevance of
these genes under drought stress. GO enrichment analysis found that 60 GO terms were differentially represented between AB1-1 and AB2-1 (Figure 6; additional
file 9): 50 were overrepresented and 10 underrepresented in AB1-1. Several overrepresented terms were
associated with stress response properties such as
response to salt stress, osmotic stress, abiotic stimulus,
radiation, and light stimulus. GO terms related to the
flavonoid pathway (e.g., flavonoid metabolic process and
flavonoid biosynthetic process) and peroxidase activity

Figure 4 A graphical representation of the annotation statistics of UG-TDS: the total number of unigenes annotated as a known protein
with an E-value threshold of e-06, total number of unigens not mapped, total number of unigenes mapped but not annotated, the total
number of unigene annotated with at least one category of Gene Ontology (GO) and the number of genes annotated in each of the 3 major
GO categories, biological process, molecular function and cellular component.

(e.g., oxidoreductase activity, acting on peroxide as
acceptor and peroxidase activity) were underrepresented.
The underrepresentation of these GO terms suggests
downregulation of the flavonoid biosynthetic process
and peroxidase activity under drought stress in roots of
ICC 4958. Similar results have been reported in barley,
chickpea, and mangrove under abiotic stress [7,43,44].
GO enrichment analysis was also performed between
ESTs derived from the parental genotype library and
RILs library to determine differential responses between
parents and RILs. Compared with parental genotype
libraries, 13 GO terms were significantly overrepresented in RILs bulk libraries (Additional file 10). GO
enrichment analysis of forward-subtracted and reversesubtracted SSH libraries to determine differential GO
representation between up- and downregulated EST sets
(Figure 7; Additional file 9) showed overrepresentation
of GO terms related to stress response properties, such
as response to stress, heat, temperature, and abiotic stimulus in the upregulated libraries (AS1-1 and AR1-1).
Three GO terms intrinsic to membrane, membrane
part, and integral to membrane were underrepresented
in the upregulated libraries. These differential enriched
GO terms related to stress response in upregulated

libraries indicate the efficiency of the SSH technique to
clone up- and downregulated genes by the forward- and
reverse-subtraction methodology. By this analysis, we
have a priori-defined gene networks involved in drought
stress in chickpea, which can be used to select droughtresponsive candidate genes in chickpea.
Differential expression analysis of unigenes under
drought stress

Myoinositol-1-phosphate synthase (MIPS) and pyrroline5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) (involved in the synthesis of pinitol and proline, respectively) were upregulated
under drought stress (Figure 8). The concentration of
pinitol, a cyclic sugar alcohol, is high in halophytic plants
and plants adapted to drought [45]. MIPS transcript
abundance, and it’s content increases in several plant
species in response to environmental stresses [27,46,47].
Two MIPS genes from chickpea CaMIPS1 and CaMIPS2
have been isolated and characterized for their role in
water stress [48]. Differential patterns of MIPS-coding
genes occur in maize [49], Arabidopsis [50], and rice [46].
Unigenes P5CS1 (UG-TDS_Contig353) and P5CS2
(HO066525) were significantly upregulated under water
stress (Figure 8). A significant increase in proline

as an indicator of stress-adaptive response of plants [51].
In our study, different LEA groups of genes were
found in UG-TDS: 2 unigenes encoding HVA protein

(HO065000, unigene_Contig11), 5 encoding LEA proteins (HO063258, HO065296, HO0065083, UGTDS_Contig311 and UG-TDS_Contig524), 6 encoding

HO066163), and 1 encoding ERD proteins (HO065032).
Among these LEA group 2 members [LEA (HO063258)
and dehydrin (HO065247)] were found highly up regulated in drought stress (Figure 8). Earlier studies in chickpea have also reported the induction of LEA proteins
under drought stress [27,34]. The expression profile of
LEA genes under stress supports the role of LEA proteins
as protective molecules that enable cells to survive protoplasmic water depletion [52]. Studies on overexpression
of LEA genes also support the protective role of LEA
proteins by improving the stress tolerance of transgenic
plants. Expression of the barley gene HVA1 in wheat and
rice increases drought tolerance [53], and overexpression

Page 12 of 20

of wheat LEA genes PMA80 and PMA1959 increases
dehydration tolerance in transgenic rice [54].
Different members of aquaporins subfamilies
were found in UG-TDS: which includes, 6 unigenes encoding plasma membrane intrinsic protein (UGTDS HO062890, HO064502, HO064741, HO064425,
HO064603 and HO064612), 5 unigenes encoding tonoplast intrinsic protein (UG-TDS HO064719, HO064351,
UG-TDS_Contig278, UG-TDS_Contig19 and UGTDS_Contig156) 2 unigenes encoding NOD26-like
intrinsic protein (UG-TDS HO066903 and HO062732).
The maximum numbers of the unigenes encoding aquaporin were found in root libraries and downregulation of
one of the member (HO062890) under drought stress
was conformed in northern blot analysis (Figure 8). This
is similar to downregulation of transcripts and reduction
in protein levels of most the Arabidopsis aquaporin genes
under drought condition [55], which may be an adaptive
strategy for plants to minimize water flow through cell
membranes and uphold leaf turgor to minimize water
loss. In tobacco, NtPIP1.1 and NtPIP2.1 expression is
downregulated to reduce osmotic hydraulic conductance
in the roots under drought stress [56], supporting the
role of aquaporins in drought stress maintenance.
Eleven chickpea unigenes from UG-TDS were classified as members of the AP2/ERF superfamily: 10 under
the ERF family and 1 under the RAV family. Three
members of this family (ERF1, ERF-2, and RAV) were
analyzed by Northern blot under drought stress conditions. ERF1 was downregulated whereas ERF2 was upregulated under stress conditions. Biosynthesis of ethylene
and regulation of its activation pathway are important to
mediate plant developmental processes and stress
responses in plants [57,58]. The AP2/ERF family of transcription factors, especially the CBF/DREB and ERF subfamily, has been extensively studied in response to
drought stress [59]. CAP2, a member of the chickpea
AP2 family, is responsive to various abiotic stress and
its overexpression in tobacco increases the tolerance to
dehydration and salt stress [60]. Northern blot analysis
showed that UG-TDS HO066286 coding for RAV
(related to ABI3/VP1) transcription factor was downregulated under drought stress (Figure 8). Arabidopsis
RAV1 is a brassinosteroid (BR) down-regulated gene.
High level of BR is accompanied by a very low level of
RAV1 transcripts and vice versa [61]. The involvement
of BR pathway in the enhancement of tolerance to chilling, thermo, salt, mild drought injury and pathogen
attack has been confirmed in several studies [62,63].
Therefore, the down regulation of RAV during terminal
drought stress in our study may indicate the involvement of the BR pathway.
In chickpea, 3 members of the NAC gene family (CarNAC1, CarNAC3 and CarNAC5) are strongly induced by

drought, salt, cold, and wounding [64]. We have identified 8 new members of this TF family in UG-TDS with
one NAC gene (HO067315) that have increased expression under drought stress validated by northern blot
result (Figure 8). Expression profiling and overexpression
analysis of NAC genes in several plants supports their
involvement in stress tolerance [65-67,11] K. Nakashima,

The HDZip gene (HO062575) was among the up regulated transcription factor, as reflected from northern blot
results. Two members of this gene family (HO062575

and UG-TDS_Contig226) have been identified form
UG-TDS. The functional information available on plant
HDZIP genes suggest that at list some of these genes are
involved in response to different environmental conditions [68]. Overexpression of sunflower HD-Zip gene
Habt-4 confers drought tolerance in Arabidopsis [69],
this is suggestive of important role of HD-Zip protein in
regulation of expression of genes involved in drought
tolerance.
Hypothetical proteins are genes of unknown functions
predicted from the Arabidopsis or rice genome
sequence. Two such genes HP-1 and HP-2 were significantly induced in WS plants. Several hypothetical genes
have now been characterized by advanced bioinformatics
tools by identifying similarity of conserved function
domains. For example, in Arabidopsis, the family of
BAG proteins initially annotated as hypothetical proteins

Deokar et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:70
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/70

are now annotated as bag gene family members, their
function as regulators of apoptosis-like processes has
also been characterized.
Functional characterization of such unknown hypothetical proteins can shed light on the mechanism of
drought adaptation in chickpea.
We found transcript levels of the chlorophyll a/bbinding protein to be downregulated during stress. Most
of the strongly downregulated transcripts were related
to photosynthesis, photorespiration, and metabolism of
amino acids and carbohydrates. In a dehydration shock
treatment, the transcript level of chlorophyll a/b-binding
protein remained unchanged [27]; similarly, in barley,
chlorophyll a/b-binding protein transcript (NP_917525)
levels do not change under dehydration shock treatment
but are downregulated by drought stress treatment [70],
indicating differential response of genes under dehydration and drought stress.
Comparative transcript profiles of ICC 4958 and ICC 1882
under drought stress

To identify differentially regulated transcripts in
response to terminal drought stress between droughttolerant ICC 4958 and drought-susceptible ICC 1882,
SSH libraries AB1-1 and AB2-1 were constructed. To
validate these differentially expressed transcripts, a
nylon macroarray, using unigenes from AB1-1 and AB21 libraries, was constructed. Total RNA from waterstressed ICC 4958 and ICC 1882 was used to assess the
genotype-specific response of these genes under drought
stress (Figure 9). The unigenes showing at least 1.5-fold

Page 14 of 20

of induction were selected for further analysis (additional file 11).
The normalized expression intensities of unigenes and
the results of hierarchical clustering analysis according
to their relative expression patterns is graphically represented by a heat map in Figure 10. Hierarchical clustering resulted in the formation of 3 clusters (cluster I, II
and III). Clusters I and II included unigenes that were
upregulated in ICC 4958, whereas cluster III included
unigenes downregulated in ICC 4958 as compared with
ICC 1882 (Figure 11).
Genes in clusters I and II were associated with metabolic process [e.g., ethylene biosynthesis (HO062211,
HO062180), flavonoid synthesis (HO062384), and amino
acid biosyntheses (HO062526, HO062310 and
HO062183)] and also these genes shown to be involved
in drought response in several other plants [71,72].
Upregulation of genes involved in ion binding and transport activities [e.g., ATP-binding proteins (HO063146),
lipid transfer proteins (HO062394, HO062798), UDPgalactose transporters (HO062219), metal ion binding
(HO062399), sulfate transporters (HO063202), tonoplast
intrinsic proteins (HO062783), were also upregulated in
ICC 4958. In an earlier study, we reported by in silico
differential expression analysis the upregulation of the
tonoplast intrinsic protein in the roots of ICC 4958,
which mediates the regulation of root hydraulic conductivity in response to environmental stimuli [9]. Several
stress-related genes [e.g., pathogenesis-related proteins
(HO062911, HO062939) and peroxidase (HO062698),
chaperone binding (HO062569) and small heat shock

protein (HO062866)] upregulated in ICC 4958 and have
been shown to be induced by wounding, salt, and cold
stress in other plant species [73,74] indicates multiple
stress induction of these genes. Similarly known stressresponsive transcription factors and regulators such as
the AP2/ERF domain-containing transcription factor
(HO062802), MYB transcription factor (HO062363),
DNA repair and transcription factor XPB1 (HO062308),
and transcription regulators (HO062392) were also
upregulated in ICC 4958. A similar differential induction
of these genes or gene categories in drought-tolerant
genotypes in response to drought stress during the
reproductive stage has been reported in barley [75].
Cluster III contained unigenes that were upregulated
in ICC 1882 but not ICC 4958. One upregulated
unigene encoded fructose-bisphosphate aldolase
(HO063129), whose downregulation could inhibit gluconeogenesis for conserving energy in drought-stressed
plants (41).
To validate the results of dot blot analysis, 10 differentially expressed unigenes were analyzed by qPCR. Realtime PCR confirmed the differential expression of these
genes under terminal drought stress conditions (Figure
12). The genes showing significant differential expression between the 2 genotypes can be explored as potential candidate genes that can confer terminal drought
tolerance in chickpea, using transgenic overexpression
and TILLING (targeting induced local lesions in genomes) analysis.

mean, green colour represents expression less than the mean and
colour intensities in between the two represent the magnitude of
the deviation from the mean. Colour scale (from green to red)

Conclusions
We report the sequencing, assembly, and annotation of
5494 high-quality drought-responsive EST sequences
from chickpea. This dataset was generated from SSH
libraries constructed using drought-tolerant and -susceptible chickpea genotypes and bulks of their progenies
exhibiting HRB and LRB phenotypes. SSH libraries
allowed cloning genes that are specifically up- and
downregulated from the roots and shoots of chickpea in
response to terminal drought. Moreover, we identified
more than 1500 novel unigenes in chickpea that are
associated with terminal drought stress. Besides several
transcripts coding for known stress-related proteins, several novel genes with unknown functions that may have
a potential role in drought tolerance in chickpea were
also identified. This study also provides a comparative
overview of genotype-specific expression patterns of
more than 830 unigenes in root tissues of chickpea in
response to drought. The up- and downregulation of
some unigenes was confirmed by real-time qPCR. The
EST dataset and the information about transcription of
several genes can be useful for the research community
and help identify potential candidate genes for drought
tolerance in chickpea. Our study can also serve as an
