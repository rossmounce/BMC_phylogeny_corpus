Genome-wide comparative analysis of
metacaspases in unicellular and filamentous
cyanobacteria
Qiao Jiang1, Song Qin2, Qing-yu Wu1*

Abstract
Background: Cyanobacteria are an ancient group of photoautotrophic prokaryotes with wide variations in genome
size and ecological habitat. Metacaspases (MCAs) are cysteine proteinases that have sequence homology to
caspases and play essential roles in programmed cell death (PCD). MCAs have been identified in several
prokaryotes, fungi and plants; however, knowledge about cyanobacterial metacaspases still remains obscure. With
the availability of sequenced genomes of 33 cyanobacteria, we perform a comparative analysis of metacaspases
and explore their distribution, domain structure and evolution.
Results: A total of 58 putative MCAs were identified, which are abundant in filamentous diazotrophic
cyanobacteria and Acaryochloris marina MBIC 11017 and absent in all Prochlorococcus and marine Synechococcus
strains, except Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. The Cys-His dyad of caspase superfamily is conserved, while mutations
(Tyr in place of His and Ser/Asn/Gln/Gly instead of Cys) are also detected in some cyanobacteria. MCAs can be
classified into two major families (a and b) based on the additional domain structure. Ten types and a total of 276
additional domains were identified, most of which involves in signal transduction. Apoptotic related NACHT
domain was also found in two cyanobacterial MCAs. Phylogenetic tree of MCA catalytic P20 domains coincides
well with the domain structure and the phylogenies based on 16s rRNA.
Conclusions: The existence and quantity of MCA genes in unicellular and filamentous cyanobacteria are a function
of the genome size and ecological habitat. MCAs of family a and b seem to evolve separately and the recruitment
of WD40 additional domain occurs later than the divergence of the two families. In this study, a general framework
of sequence-structure-function connections for the metacaspases has been revealed, which may provide new
targets for function investigation.

Background
Cyanobacteria are among the earliest branching groups on
earth, dating back 2.5-3.5 billion years, based on the fossil
evidence [1]. As a taxonomic unit characterized by the
ability to execute oxygenic photosynthesis, cyanobacteria
constitute a group of species diverse in genome size and
ecological habitats, indicating the significance of comparative genome research. Cyanobacteria, with a variation in
genome size from 1.6 Mb (Prochlorococcus sp. MIT9301)
to 9.2 Mb (Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102), are found in
almost every imaginable environment, from ocean to fresh
water to bare rock. Cyanobacteria also inhabit in the

extreme environments, for example, Synechococcus sp.
JA-2-3B’a (2-13) and Synechococcus sp. JA-3-3Ab
were separated from hot spring. As unicellular and nonnitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, Prochlorococcus sp. and
Synechococcus sp. maintain the smallest genome sizes and
account for significant biomass and primary production of
marine biosphere [2]. Other unicellular species have larger
genome sizes, including water bloom forming cyanobacteria (Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Microcystis
aeruginosa NIES-843), a thylakoids absence cyanobacterium (Gloeobacter sp. PCC 7421), a nitrogen-fixing
cyanobacterium (Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142), and an
animal-cyanobacterial symbionsis (Acaryochloris marina
MBIC11017). While the diazotrophic filamentous cyanobacteria comprise the largest genome size, such as Nostoc

and marine Trichodesmium sp. IMS 101.
Programmed cell death (PCD) is a suicide mechanism
to promote and maintain genetic stability [3]. PCD was
considered as a characteristic of metazoans for a long
time before apoptosis markers were found in yeast
which indicates multicellularity is not the most important prerequisite[4]. Recently, PCD mechanism has been
observed in all but one of the six/eight major groups of
prokaryotes, with the exception of the rhizaria [5].
Experimental evidences for PCD in cyanobacteria come
from three species, including the freshwater cyanobacterium Anabaena spp. exposed to univalent-cation salts,
the bloom-causing cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa from St. Lucie Estuary by treatment with H 2 O 2
and Trichodesmium sp. IMS 101 suffering iron starvation and light irradiance [6-8].
Caspases (cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteases) are
one of the most important and widely researched apoptotic proteins in mammalian PCD. Caspase was initially
thought to be limited to metazoans, and no one had
managed to identify caspase homologues, either in plants
or bacteria. Then Uren and his colleagues identified two
ancient families of caspase-like proteins, paracaspases
and metacaspases in silico [9] and Khan and his co-workers demonstrated that a yeast metacaspase (YCA1) mediates PCD in Saccharomyces cerevisiae[10]. Hereafter,
metacaspases were found involved in PCD of yeasts, filamentous fungi, plants, and a variety of bacteria. Most of
these metacaspases share sequence homology with caspases, but show different substrate specificity [11-16].
Metacaspases belong to caspase family (C14), which are
part of the clan CD, a family of proteases characteristic
with their His/Cys catalytic dyad [17]. Metacaspases process a conserved caspase catalytic subunit P20 domain
(COG 4249, KOG1546 in the NCBI Conserved Domain
Database), and share conserved amino acid residues
within His- and Cys-catalytic sites [18]. Interestingly,
most of the typical genes encoding in metazoan PCD are
missing in bacteria and early-branching eukaryotes, such
as CAD and P53[19]. Therefore, the presence of metacaspases suggests a concernful role within PCD evolution.
Cyanobacteria maintain a rich metacaspase pool, and
many of these genes have been identified in silico [20]
was identified in some sequenced cyanobacteria strains,
including Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421, Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803,
Trichodesmium erythraeum ISM 101, Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102, Nostoc sp. PCC 7120, and Anabaena
variabilis ATCC 29413. Metacaspases were absent
in MED3, Prochlorococcus marinus MIT 9313, SS
120 (CCMP 1375), Synechococcus sp. WH 8102, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and Synechococcus

elongates [20]. With the completion of genome sequencing of several cyanobacterial species, modifications and
supplements are needed.
As of November 2008, 33 genomes of unicellular and
filamentous cyanobacteria became available, which facilitates cyanobacterial systemic analysis for restrictionmodification systems and serine/threonine protein
kinases [21]. The comparative genome research on metacaspases and other PCD proteins in filamentous fungi
has been documented [22]. Besides, Koonin and Aravind
described a clear affinity of bacterial metacaspases and
the metazoan caspases by phylogenetic analysis of caspase-like protease superfamily [19]. In this study, we
selected five proven metacaspases in marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana to search for cyanobacterial metacaspases [11]. Metacaspases in Thalassiosira pseudonana
were chosen due to the few metacaspases verified experimentally in cyanobacteria and the close evolutional relationship between cyanobacteria and eukaryotic
phytoplankton. We employed a BLASTp-plus-phylogeny
reconstruction approach [22] to analyze metacaspase
sequences in cyanobacteria, and present an overall view
of their classifications, structure, phylogeny and evolution. Better understanding of cyanobacterial metacaspases may provide further insights into evolution of PCD.

Results
Identification of metacaspase proteins

The 33 complete cyanobacterial genomes downloaded
from IMG database were used in this research (Table 1,
Figure 1). To identify proteins similar to proven metacaspases from Thalassiosira pseudonana, we performed
BLASTp searches of the 33 cyanobacterial genomes.
CDD [23,24] and SMART [25] analyses with the derived
sequences were then carried out to eliminate false positives. Two proteins annotated as caspase catalytic subunit P20 in IMG database, including 638107126 (IMG
Gene Object Identifier) from Trichodesmium erythraeum ISM 101 and 641540115 from Microcystis aeruginosa NIES-843, were found to lack catalytic domain
and excluded. Of two proteins (637313946 from Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1, and 638107265 from
Trichodesmium erythraeum ISM 101), CASc domain
(caspase catalytic subunit P20) recognized by CDD was
not identified in SMART analysis [23], and both of the
proteins were excluded. Altogether, 58 putative metacaspase sequences were considered in this study (Table 2).
Twenty-six of which were originally annotated as peptidase C14, caspase catalytic subunit p20 or protein containing caspase domain. The remaining 32 proteins were
accepted as metacaspases in this research, including 18
proteins annotated by other additional domains (such as
ATPase, GUN4-like family protein, Chase2 sensor protein and WD40 repeats), 12 proteins annotated as

hypothetical proteins, and 2 proteins annotated as
unknown function protein DUF323.
Amid diverse cyanobacterial genomes, the number of
metacaspase genes varies from 0 to 10. Within unicellular cyanobacteria, Symbiont Acaryochloris marina MBIC
11017 has 8 MCAs, much more than other species. Correspondingly, the percentage of metacaspases within
total proteins (0.13%) is highest among unicellular cyanobacteria. All of the marine Synechococcus strains lack
MCAs except for Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. Only
one metacaspase gene was found in the Synechocystis sp.
PCC 6803. Four Synechococcus strains inhabit in freshwater, land and hot spring contain one metacaspase for
each, including PCC 6301, PCC 7942, JA-2-3B’a(2-3),

and JA-3-3Ab. Water-blooming cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa NIES-843 contains two MCAs. The
percentages of MCAs within total proteins (0.03%
-0.04%) in Synechocystis sp., Synechococcus sp. and
Microcystis sp. strains are the lowest. The other two unicellular cyanobacterial strains, Gloeobacter violaceus
PCC 7421 and Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142, maintain 3
to 4 MCAs and have moderate percentages of MCAs in
total proteins: 0.09% and 0.06%, respectively.
Compared to unicellular cyanobacteria, filamentous
diazotrophic cyanobacteria have more metacaspase
genes (10 for Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS 101, 9 for
Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413, 9 for Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102, and 7 for Nostoc sp. PCC 7120).

Figure 1 Phylogenetic tree of the sequenced cyanobacterial strains based on 16s rRNA. Phylogenetic tree reconstruction of the 33 fully
sequenced cyanobacteria was performed based on 16s rRNA as described in the Methods section. The number on each branch indicates a
bootstrap probability (1000 replicates).

Among the filamentous cyanobacteria, Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 has the largest genome; however,
nonheterocystous cyanobacterium Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS 101 contains the largest number of metacaspases and the highest percentage in total protein
(0.22%) (Table 1).
One or two MCAs containing mutations of conserved
catalytic sites (His/Cys) were found in every cyanobacterial strain, exclusive of Gloeobacter violaceus PCC
7421. In most cases, the His residues are replaced by
Tyr, and the Cys residues mutate into Ser, Asn or Gly.
Uniquely, within the metacaspase (641678142) from
Cyanothece sp. ATTC 51142, Gln substitutes for the
Cys residue (Table 1, 2).

Structure and function

Based on structural characteristics, we classify the identified cyanobacterial metacaspases into two families,
cbMC a and cbMC b (Figure 2).
Cyanobacterial metacaspase Family a (cbMC a)
includes 27 MCAs that process none other identifiable
domains than P20. This family was further divided into
four subfamilies. Subfamily a (cbMC a-I) processing the
CASc domain only, contains one MCA (637235425
from Nostoc sp. PCC 7120). Subfamily II (cbMC a-TM)
maintaining a single transmembrane (TM) domain, contains five MCAs found in filamentous cyanobacteria
Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413, Nostoc punctiforme
PCC 73102, Nostoc sp. PCC 7120, and unicellular

cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina MBIC 11017.
Subfamily III (cbMC a-other) contains 20 proteins,
which is the majority in cyanobacterial MCAs. These
MCAs have an unidentified C-terminal domain each,
and distribute among all cyanobacterial strains except
Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421. MCAs attributed to
subfamily I to III process CASc in their N-terminal.
While the single MCA of Subfamily IV (cbMC a-C),
638107819 from Trichodesmium erythraeum ISM 101,
holds the CASc domain in the C-terminal.
Cyanobacterial metacaspase Family b (cbMC b) occupying at least one additional domain, comprises 31
(53.4%) metacaspases from all filamentous cyanobacteria
and three unicellular species (Cyanothece sp. ATCC
51142, Acaryochloris marina MBIC 11017, and Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421). The number of additional
domains varies from 16 to 56. Gloeobacter violaceus
PCC 7421 contains the largest number of additional
domains, which is 14 times than that of the total MCAs
(Table 1). Seven unicellular strains lack additional
domains, including Synechococcus sp. strains, Microcystis
aeruginosa NIES-843 and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.
In total, 10 types of additional domains were identified
in cyanobacterial MCAs: ANF-receptor, WD40, GUN4,
NACHT, DUF323, CHASE2, Pentapeptide, DEXDc,
HELICc, and EZ-HEAT (Figure 2, Table 3). Most of
these domains are involved in signal transduction, for
example CHASE2, GUN4, ANF-receptor and WD40
(Table 3). In addition, prevalent domains with

scaffolding or unknown functions in bacteria were identified, such as DUF323, EZ HEAT and Pentapeptide
[21]. Two domains within helicases, HELICc and
DEXDc, were found to fuse together in 641257535 of
Acaryochloris marina MBIC 11017. Interestingly, PCD
related domain NACHT was also detected in two MCAs
(641676675 from Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 and
641252580 from Acaryochloris marina MBIC 11017).
WD40 repeats, the most prevalent additional domains
identified in 6 cyanobacterial species, replicate for 7 to
15 copies in a single metacaspase protein. Some additional domains were identified exclusively in a particular
metacaspase protein, including DEXDc and HELICc in
641257535 (Acaryochloris marina MBIC 11017); EZ
HEAT in 638106962 (Trichodesmium erythraeum ISM
101), CHASE2 in 638105709 (Trichodesmium erythraeum ISM 101), and ANF-receptor in 638386606
(Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102).
Phylogenetic analysis

Considering the confusion created by additional
domains with possibly separate evolutionary histories,
the conserved catalytic domains of MCAs instead of
their whole sequences were used during the phylogenetic study (Figure 3). The catalytic domains, about 340
amino acids in length, were identified using SMART
and CDD databases [23,26]. The MCA phylogenetic tree
was rooted in the human caspase-3 and the putative
metacaspase of Gamma proteobacterium.

The phylogeny tree comprises two clades in general.
MCAs from cbMC a belong to Clade I (green box in
Figure 3) that also includes two bacterial MCAs
(637773422 from Chlorobium chlorochromatii and
642380481 from Rhizobium leguminosarum) and seven
eukaryotic MCAs from T. pseudonana, S. cerevisiae and
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. All of these MCAs are
orthologues because of obvious evolutionary relationships with high bootstrap value. Clade II (grey box in Figure 3) contains members of cbMC b family with WD40,
DUF323 and signalling domains, which cluster separately
according to the additional domains. Those from subfamily cbMC a-TM and eubacteria (Rhizobium leguminosarum and Rhodopseudomonas palustris) attribute to
Clade II as well. In a word, most photosynthetic bacterial
MCAs cluster with MCAs of cyanobacterial family b and
the eukaryotic MCAs gather with family a. Within each
clade, the MCAs cluster according to the phylogeny of
the species.
Within clade I, one copy of MCA containing the His/
Cys mutation is found in each cyanobacterium that
maintains MCA, except for Gloeobacter violaceus PCC
7421. All of these MCAs belong to cbMC a-other and
cluster strictly based on the phylogeny of the species.
All of the mutated MCAs in clade I are orthologs
because of their close evolutionary relationships. Besides,
four mutated MCAs from one unicellular and three filamentous cyanobacteria gather together in clade II.
Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413 and Nostoc sp. PCC
7120, two filamentous species that show close evolutionary relationships in 16S rRNA tree, share 3 pairs of
MCA sequences in clade I. Four WD40-containing
MCAs from Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421 form a
separate cluster together. In addition, some MCAs adjacent to each other on the chromosome display close
evolutionary relationships, including 637717526/
637717527, 637718423/637718424 of Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413 and 637230642/637230643 of Nostoc
sp. PCC 7120. Some MCAs of subfamily a are flanked
with two WD40- or GUN4-containing MCAs.

Discussion
Although metacaspases do not cleave caspase substrates
[12,18,27-29], several evidences have been given to support their roles in PCD in plants (see review [30]). For
example, when challenged by the plant pathogen, Arabidopsis KO lines of metacaspase suppress cell death [31].
Arabidopsis metacaspse-8 KO lines triggered by UVC or
H2O2 display reduced cell death [12]. Moreover, in the
suspensor cells of an embryogenic culture of Picea
abies, down-regulation of MCA leads to a phenotype
with a reduced cell death [32].
What makes metacaspases so interesting? First, most
of the metazoan PCD-related genes are lost in

Jiang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:198
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/198

unicellular organisms, excepting metacaspases that play
vital roles in PCD of eukaryotic planktons and yeasts.
Second, compared with caspases and paracaspases identified in higher animals, metacaspases are widespread
among bacteria, fungi and plants, which suggest their
early evolutionary positions [33].
Bidle and Falkowski identified cyanobacterial and phytoplankton metacaspases in silico, and explored the evolution deeply [20]. With the completion of genome
sequencing of several cyanobacterial species, modifications and supplements are needed. For example, MCA
was reported to be absent in Synechococcus sp. PCC
7942, but a protein (ID: 637798702, annotation:
hypothetical protein) was found to contain P20 domain.
Cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1
was proved to have no metacaspase orthologue in our
study. Moreover, with the release of genomic sequence,
MCAs were identified in Synechococcus sp. JA-3-3Ab
and Synechococcus sp. JA-2-3B’a(2-13).
The distribution of putative metacaspase encoding open
readingframes (ORFs) in cyanobacteria is an integrated
function of the genome sizes and the ecophysiological
properties. Most cyanobacteria process proportionate
numbers of putative metacaspase genes with genome sizes,
except for symbiotic Acaryochloris marina MBIC 11017.
Though death is not the only way to adapt to environmental changes, for example, cyanobacteria modify their metabolism in response to different stress conditions [34],
death is still a direct and drastic cellular response to environmental changes. Thus diverse distributions of metacaspase genes may reflect various environmental selective
pressures. For example, putative MCA encoding ORFs are
not widespread through unicellular cyanobacteria
(Table 1). All of the Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus
strains lived in the oligotrophic open ocean lack putative
metacaspase genes. While Synechococcus strains that inhabit in freshwater and hot spring still maintain one metacaspase encoding ORF. Considering the similar genome size,
environmental selective pressure may take responsibility
for this difference. Parallel conclusion was provided by Serine/threonine kinases in cyanobacteria indicating remarkable reduction of signal transduction proteins and
environmental stress response systems in the ocean [21].
Gene lost is revealed to facilitate these cyanobacteria to
acclimatize to the oligotrophic environment. The major
driving force was supposed to be “a selective process
favouring the adaptation of these cyanobacteria”, which
was discussed by Alexis Dufresne et al. in detail [35]. Filamentous heterocystous cyanobacteria, on the other hand,
differentiate heterocysts in response to the absence of
combined nitrogen, and exhibit ecological properties
including broad symbiotic competence with plants and
fungi [21], contain more putative MCA encoding ORFs
even after allowing for their larger genome sizes [36].

The symbol of caspase superfamily is the possession of
catalytic P20 domain and the conserved Cys-His dyad,
forming the “specificity pocket” [9]. Within cyanobacterial metacaspases, sequence contexts of His and Cys are
basically the same as those in caspases (His:(Y/F)SGHG,
and Cys:QAC(R/Q)G) [17]. The maintaining of the conserved His and Cys indicate the importance of these catalytic sites. Interestingly, 17 cyanobacterial MCAs
encode Tyr in place of His and Ser/Asn/Gln/Gly instead
of Cys. Likewise, of two metacaspases in T. brucei,
TbMCA1 and TbMCA4, Ser occupies the site of the
putative Cys [37]. Considering the fact that experimental
mutation of the active-site cysteine to serine resulted in
inactive of some cysteine peptidases, mutated cyanobacterial metacaspases may be catalytically inactive.
Domain fusion provides a chance to recruit related functions in a single protein, especially within bacteria which
maintain smaller genomes and compact gene clusters [19].
Additional domains of cyanobacterial MCAs, such as
GUN4 [38] and WD40 [39], illuminate the signalling pathways involved in PCD. Owe to the considerably specific
proteolytic activity and proximity-induced activation, the
signalling domains may be the target of the metacaspases.
Consequently, metacaspases may take a share in signalling
mediation instead of mere protein degradation. Two
domains within helicases, HELICc and DEXDc, were
found to fuse together in 641257535 of Acaryochloris marina MBIC 11017, which implies the interactions between
the caspase proteolytic activity and ATP-dependent RNA/
DNA unwinding. In addition, domains with same functions tend to assemble in a protein [19], therefore the
identification of NACHT [19,22,40] domain reinforces the
possibility of metacaspase involving in PCD. Compared
with metazoan caspases, bacterial metacaspases may present a minimal set of apoptotic machinery. Additional
domains are typically employed as “sensor response modules” and form multi-domain proteins with MCAs to participate in signal transduction. It can be imagined that
caspases recruit additional domains or even large motifs to
apoptotic complexes in the evolution.
Previous classification criterion of MCAs is based on
the prodomain, and MCAs can be classified into two
families (“Type I with an N-terminal extension” and
“Type II with a linker region between the putative large
and small subunits”) [9,18,36]. However, most cyanobacterial MCAs maintain a C-terminal extension without
the linker region and have varied additional domains
(Figure 2, Figure 3). Therefore a novel categorization
standard based on the additional domain was given in
this research. To avoid future confusion of the MCA
families, the names “Type a” and “Type b” were used
instead of “Type I” and “Type II”.
The obtained metacaspase phylogenetic tree indicates
that MCAs display clear-cut relationships, based strictly

Jiang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:198
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/198

on structural characteristics and the phylogeny of the
species. Moreover, compared to the species phylogeny,
structural characteristics play a more critical role. The
tree of catalytic P20 domains coincides well with the
phylogenies based on 16s rRNA, indicating the rare
gene gain-and-loss events and the importance of MCAs
that remain conserved in history. Besides, four WD40containing MCAs from Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421
form a separate cluster indicating obvious lineage-specific duplication events. Anabaena variabilis ATCC
29413 and Nostoc sp. PCC 7120, two filamentous species that enjoy a very close evolutionary relatedness in
16S rRNA tree, share 3 pairs of MCA sequences in
clade I. These nonorthologous MCAs may be produced
by gene duplication before the divergence of the two
species.
Most photosynthetic bacterial MCAs cluster with
MCAs of cyanobacterial family b (with additional
domain) and the eukaryotic MCAs cluster with family a
(without additional domain). The presence of the
mutated MCAs and their convergences suggest that
MCAs of family a and b evolve separately. One possibility is that the recruitment of WD40 additional domain
occurs later than the divergence of the two clades.

Conclusions
The availability of cyanobacterial genome sequences
facilitates comparative analysis. Metacaspases, sequence
homologs to caspases, play key roles in programmed cell
death (PCD) in several prokaryotes, fungi and plants.
Among 33 species of cyanobacteria, a total of 58 putative metacaspase genes have been identified. The quantity of metacaspase genes in unicellular and filamentous
cyanobacteria depends on the genome size and ecological habitat. The Cys-His dyad of caspase superfamily is
conserved in most cyanobacterial MCAs, however, Tyr
and Ser/Asn/Gln/Gly residues have also been detected
in the sites of His and Cys within some metacaspases.
Ten types and a total of 276 additional domains were
identified, most of which may involve in signal recognition. Programmed cell death related NACHT domain
was also found in cyanobacterial metacaspases. Phylogenetic tree of MCA catalytic P20 domains coincides well
with the phylogenies based on 16s rRNA.
Methods
Thirty-three species of cyanobacteria, including Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, Synechocystis, Gloeobacter,
Cyanothece, Microcystis, Trichodesmium, Acaryochloris,
Anabaena and Nostoc were used in this analysis. Since
sequences of 36 species had not been fully released, they
were not considered in our comparisons. All of the 33
genome sequences (as of Nov. 2008) were accessed from
IMG in FASTA format [41].

In order to identify genes that may encode metacaspases, proven metacaspases from marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana (Protein id: 270038, 2505, 268857,
270007, 38187 in Thalassiosira pseudonana “finished
chromosomes” database v3.0 [11,42]) were used to construct a query protein set. BLASTp (protein-protein
BLAST) [22,43,44] was conducted locally to search all
proteins from each of the 33 cyanobacteria. Proteins
found by this method that fit the criteria for a genuine
metacaspase were added to the query set for another
round of BLASTp searches. A threshold e-value of 1e10 was set in the first two rounds, which changed into
2e-20 subsequently. The procedure was continued until
no new proteins were found.
Proteins identified by BLASTp were aligned using
Clustal X (Version 1.83) program [45] with a gap opening penalty of 10, a gap extension penalty of 0.2, and
Gonnet as the weight matrix. The alignment was examined by inspection of peptidase C14, caspase catalytic
subunit P20 domain (COG 4249, KOG1546 in the NCBI
Conserved Domain Database [23,24]). A protein was
accepted as a metacaspase if it was possible to recognize
P20 domain and if the most conserved His and Cys residues known to participate in the function of metacaspases [18] were present. However, minor alterations of
the conserved His and Cys residues were tolerated. Specifically, putative MCA genes encoding Tyr in place of
His and Ser/Asn/Gln/Gly instead of Cys were taken into
account as well. Structure analyses of the obtained
metacaspases were performed using the SMART (Simple
Modular Architecture Research Tool) [25,26] and the
CDD (Conserved Domains Database) [23,24], relying on
hidden Markov models and Reverse Position-Specific
BLAST separately. Sequences of the P20 domain (about
300 aa in length) used for phylogenetic tree construction
were obtained from the SMART database [25,26]. Trees
based on metacaspase P20 domain and cyanobacterial
16s rRNA were constructed using NJ methods of the
MEGA package (Version 4.0) [46], and the reliability of
each branch was tested by 1000 bootstrap replications.
In phylogenetic analysis of MCA, putative metacaspase
of Gamma proteobacterium and human caspase-3 were
used as outgroups to root the tree.
