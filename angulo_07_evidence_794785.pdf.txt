Abstract
Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) has a causal role in cervical cancer with almost half a
million new cases occurring each year. Presence of the carcinogenic HPV is necessary for the
development of the invasive carcinoma of the genital tract. Therefore, persistent infection with
carcinogenic HPV causes virtually all cervical cancers. Some aspects of the molecular evolution of
this virus, as the putative importance of recombination in its evolutionary history, are an opened
current question. In addition, recombination could also be a significant issue nowadays since the
frequency of co-infection with more than one HPV type is not a rare event and, thus, new
recombinant types could be currently being generated.
Results: We have used human alpha-PV sequences from the public database at Los Alamos
National Laboratory to report evidence that recombination may exist in this virus. A model-based
population genetic approach was used to infer the recombination signal from the HPV DNA
sequences grouped attending to phylogenetic and epidemiological information, as well as to clinical
manifestations. Our results agree with recently published ones that use a different methodology to
detect recombination associated to the gene L2. In addition, we have detected significant
recombination signal in the genes E6, E7, L2 and L1 at different groups, and importantly within the
high-risk type HPV16. The method used has recently been shown to be one of the most powerful
and reliable procedures to detect the recombination signal.
Conclusion: We provide new support to the recent evidence of recombination in HPV.
Additionally, we performed the recombination estimation assuming the best-fit model of nucleotide
substitution and rate variation among sites, of the HPV DNA sequence sets. We found that the
gene with recombination in most of the groups is L2 but the highest values were detected in L1
and E6. Gene E7 was recombinant only within the HPV16 type. The topic deserves further study
because recombination is an important evolutionary mechanism that could have high impact both
in pharmacogenomics (i.e. on the influence of genetic variation on the response to drugs) and for
vaccine development.

Background
Presence of the carcinogenic human papillomavirus
(HPV) is necessary for the development of the invasive

carcinoma of the genital tract [1]. Persistent infection with
carcinogenic HPV causes virtually all cervical cancers.
According to the latest global estimates this cancer is the

second most common in women after breast cancer [2].
Almost half a million new cases of cervical cancer occur
each year among women world-wide causing 274.000
deaths, 85% of them happening in underdevelopment
countries[3].
The HPV genome has three different regions: two coding
(E – early and L – late expression) and a regulatory noncoding region. The early region codifies regulatory, transforming and replication proteins, among which E6 and E7
are known to act like oncoproteins in high risk virus types
[4,5]. The late region (L) contains two coding genes, L1
and L2, which encode viral capsid proteins.
Among more than 100 types of HPV known today,
approximately 30 infect the genital tract. Within these,
HPV16 and HPV18 are the two types with the highest
oncogenic power. A prospective way of fighting cervical
cancer is with an anti-HPV vaccine. Phase III vaccine trials
are being developed by Merck, GlaxoSmithKline and the
National Cancer Institute [5,6]. Besides, research is ongoing on different aspects of HPV biology, such as the mechanisms of down-regulation through which HPV causes
cell transformation, the evaluation of biomarkers for risk
progression, the role of environmental co-factors and the
determinants of immune response to the viral infection
[1]. However, to have a better understanding of the HPV,
it is key to gain an improved insight from an evolutionary
perspective [7,8]. The possibility for HPV recombination
was first suggested by several facts: The biological viability
of artificial HPV strains with chimerical proteins [9]. The
appearance of some HPV16 variants that seemed mosaics
between different established types [10]. The isolation of
a novel HPV type (HPV77) with an unusual pattern of
sequence similarity over the E6, E7 and L1 regions
[11,12]. The plurality of HPV types [13] and also by the
frequent observed co-infection (M. Angulo, personal
observation). The latter will be specially important in
AIDS patients which are often co-infected with very
diverse mixtures of human papillomavirus (HPV) [1417].
Because of HPV extreme diversity, the occurrence of
recombination was initially discarded, in part because of
the technical difficulties for aligning extremely diverse
sequences, and in part because of the less accurate methods available for the researchers until the past decade.
Nevertheless, recently reported phylogenetic incongruence at the putative high-risk ancestor node, showing that
one or more presumed old recombination events should
explain a non monophyletic evolution of oncogenic HPVs
[18,19], has provided new convincing support of recombination in α-PVs. In addition, a recent rigorous analysis,
using several recombination estimation methods, has

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/33

provided fresh evidence of ancient recombination in papillomavirus, especially for the L2 gene [20].
However, the methods used to assess the presence of
recombination signals were either phylogenetic based or
substitution based. No model-based method was used.
Hence, the difficulty of aligning all currently sequenced
PVs imposes an additional challenge. Here we addressed
the existence of recombination in HPV using a very efficient composite likelihood method [21,22]. The advantages of this kind of method, which is a model-based
method, over the model-free ones, are well-known [23]
including the fact that with model-free ones the true level
of recombination that has occurred is greatly underestimated.
We have centered on human alpha PV sequences, which
alignment is much more reliable. Our goal was to get
recombination estimates of different genes (E6, E7, L1
and L2) in different groups. We defined three groups (GI,
GII and GIII) attending to their phylogenetic relationships
but also to their epidemiology and clinical outcome. The
identification of the specific recombinant sequences or
the recombination break points is a more complex problem and requires different algorithms and software, being
out of the scope of the present paper.

Results
Evolutionary model and rate variation
Table 1 shows the best-fit models of nucleotide substitution selected for each data set. Different models were
selected for the different genes and for the different
groups. The simplest models were found within the
HPV16 group and the most complex ones (GTR) for the
gene L2 in GI and GII groups. L2 had also the most complex model within the HPV16 and the GIII groups (Table
1).

In addition, rate variation among sites has been detected
in several of the data sets, though only in few ones the
shape value of the gamma distribution was below one
indicating an important rate heterogeneity [24]. The significant rate variation (below one) was mainly detected
for GII and GIII groups (Table 1).
Population recombination
Using a gene conversion model with a Jukes-Cantor
nucleotide evolution model [25] and assuming no rate
variation we found significant recombination in all genes
and in all groups (Figure 1). The highest value of recombination was found associated with E6 and the highest
number of groups with recombination was linked to L2.
Recombination was detected in the genes L1, L2 and E6
only for the GI group (high risk). For the gene E7 recombination was detected only within HPV16 type within

which, however, no other recombinant gene were
detected.
When using the best-fit models of nucleotide substitution
and considering the estimated rate variation the obtained
results were qualitatively similar but with a bit higher estimates and a new signal for L1 in the GII group (cf. Figures
1 and 2).
Given the estimated recombination values and the
number of sequences at each group, the expected number
of recombination events associated with each data set can
be computed [26]. For example, for HPV-16 with a recombination value of 13 for the gene E7 (Figure 2) and n = 8
sequences, the expected total number of recombination
events in the history of this sample is 34. The expected
numbers of recombination events for the different data
sets with detected significant recombination are shown in
Table 2.
Simulation experiment
A set of simulations was performed using the parameter
values corresponding to the evolutionary model, base
composition and rate variation among sites for the E6
gene in the group GI (Table 1) to obtain some control

samples of DNA sequences. This gene and group were
selected because this combination had the highest estimated significant value (Figures 1 and 2 and Table 2). We
set the recombination value to zero so that the simulated
set of sequences was obtained without recombination. We
then estimated from these sequences the population
recombination value using the composite likelihood. The
average recombination value for the simulated set of
sequences was 0.08 ± 0.03 and the percentage of false positive recombination tests was 1%. The expected number of
recombination events for this average number is 0.26.

Discussion
The estimation of the best-fit model of nucleotide substitution is relevant in phylogenetics [27]. However, modelbased approaches for estimating recombination do not
rely on a specific phylogeny and in consequence, they are
expected to be robust to model misspecification. This
seems to be the case when estimating recombination
using the composite likelihood [21,22]. Nevertheless, we
have provided the best-fit models of nucleotide substitution under the Akaike information criteria (AIC) and have
used them to estimate the population recombination rate.
As expected, the model complexity had not a major effect
on the estimation.

The existence of the recombination signal in the DNA
sequences of HPVs is important because the genes tested
are commonly used to build HPV phylogenies [28] and it
is known that recombination can mislead phylogenetic
inferences [29]. Furthermore, the detected recombination
is in agreement with recently reported phylogenetic
incongruence at the putative high-risk ancestor node
showing that one or more presumed old recombination
events should explain a non monophyletic evolution of
oncogenic HPVs [18,19]. The confirmation of ancient
papillomavirus recombination has also been recently
thoroughly argued by a statistical and phylogenetic
recombination detection study [20].

Model-based methods are known to be preferred over
substitution and phylogenetic ones [23,30-32]. Thus, the
composite-likelihood estimator maximizes the chances of
detecting recombination avoiding, however, the inference
of recombination when it is absent (false positive detection).
Regarding the existence of model complexity and rate variation among sites in the HPV samples, it is known that
the amount of divergence and rate variation in the data
could affect recombination estimation in some cases [32].
However, rate variation i.e. variation in the rate of nucleotide substitution along the sites in the DNA sequence
should have no effect on the recombination estimates
obtained using the composite-likelihood estimator as has
been previously shown [22]. However, the Pairwise program assumes a simple Jukes-Cantor model with two alle-

In contrast to that previous study, we have used a modelbased method (the coalescent composite likelihood estimator) to infer recombination from HPV DNA sequences.

les [21]. Therefore, to account for possible effects of
model complexity and rate variation we also estimated
the recombination rate using the extended model possibilities of Kpairwise [22] and confirmed that model complexity and rate variation had no qualitative effect onto
recombination estimates.
Moreover, we have designed an experiment to check the
possibility of false positive detection due to recombination artifacts because of the model complexity and the
high diversity underlying the data. As shown above, there
was not significant recombination estimation under the
parameters considered.
In addition, we were able to estimate the expected number
of recombination events in those cases with significant
recombination detection. As expected, the higher numbers were found for group GI, which incorporates a major
number of branches from PV phylogeny [19]. Importantly, not all recombination events are detectable [32],
thus those expectations just provide an upper-bound
below which the real number of detectable events should
relay [30].
Although we have detected significant recombination signal at all genes and groups in one combination or
another, perhaps the most important result is that recombination was detected at intra-type level in HPV16. This
may indicate that recombination is occurring at a relative
high frequency in current carcinogenic HPV types and variants. HPV recombination should not be exceptional
nowadays since the frequency of co-infection with more
than one HPV type is not a rare event, and new recombinant types could be currently being generated. Provided
that the oncogenicity of specific HPV intra-type variants
appear to vary geographically and also with the ethnic origin of the population studied [33], more research is necessary to assess whether such a variation could relate to
different recombinant forms. Moreover, the majority of
the vaccines under investigation, both the therapeutic and
the prophylactic ones, are based on the use of these genes
or their products, to obtain the prevention and the treatment of the infections of the more prevalent high risk
(types 16 and 18) and low risk types (6 and 11) [6/and
references there in, 34/and references there in]. From the
present work it is clear that a better knowledge of HPV
evolutionary relationships will be important concerning
the optimal number of types to include in vaccines as well
as the possibility of cross-reactive immunity among HPV
types [2,5]. Also, to obtain consensus and ancestor HPV
sequences, this could be used in vaccine design to minimize genetic differences between vaccine strains [35]. The
existence of recombination should also be of interest to
pharmacogenomic studies, i.e. to learn how genetic variation influence response to drugs.

Conclusion
We provide new support to the recent evidence of recombination in HPV. In addition, we perform an evolutionary
characterization, estimating best-fit models of nucleotide
substitution and rate variation among sites, of some
important HPV DNA sequence sets. Using simulations, we
have shown that the detected recombination signals
should not be artifacts. Thus, we found that the gene with
recombination in most of the groups is L2 but the highest
values were detected in L1 and E6. Gene E7 was recombinant only within the HPV16 type. The topic deserves
further study because recombination is an important evolutionary mechanism that could have high impact in both
pharmacogenomics (i.e. the effect of genetic variation on
response to drugs) and vaccine development.

Methods
Sequences, groups and models of nucleotide substitution
HPV sequences for the genes E6, E7, L1 and L2 were
obtained from the public database at Los Alamos
National Laboratory [36] (GenBank accession numbers
are given in Table 3). We classified these sequences
according to phylogenetic criteria [19] but also by epidemiological criteria and clinical outcome [37]. The groups
set as follows: Group I (GI) included the 14 most common high-risk types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56,
58, 59, 73, 82; n = 14 sequences including just one variant
of type 16). Group II (GII) included 6 low risk types (6,
11, 40, 42, 43, 44; n = 8 sequences including the 3 variants
of type 6, see Table 3). Group III (GIII) included 3 low risk
types plus 5 undetermined risk types which cluster
together [19] (61, 72, 81, 62, 71, 83, 84, 89; n = 12 or 11
sequences including 5 or 4 variants of type 71, see Table
3. For this group, L1 has 13 sequences because of 4 variants from type 71 plus 2 additional variants from 72 and
81 types). Finally, we consider per se the group HPV-16,
which included HPV16 variants (n = 8 sequences, Table
3). All selected sequences pertain to the genus Alpha [38].
Sequences were aligned with ClustalX [39] and then corrected by hand. The best-fit model of nucleotide substitution was selected under the Akaike information criteria
(AIC) with Modeltest v3.6 [40], using maximum likelihood (ML) estimates from PAUP* [41].
Recombination estimation
To study HPV recombination we used the composite likelihood estimator [42] and its permutation test [21], which
is one of the most powerful techniques to detect the
recombination signal from DNA sequences [22]. This
method is a model-based population genetic approach,
which allows for both a linear recombination and a gene
conversion model. The composite likelihood estimator is
implemented by the program Pairwise from the package
Ldhat, freely available at [43], and also by the extension
Kpairwise[22] which allows for complex nucleotide mod-

rate, which is 4Nr where N is the effective population size

Simulations
To check that HPV sequences do not generate recombination false positives under the composite likelihood estimator due to their particular combination of model
complexity and rate variation, we simulated 100 DNA
samples of 15 sequences each and longitude 500 bp using
a coalescent model [45]. We used the software recoal1.7
from David Posada and available upon request from him
[46]. Specifically, we set the simulations with the parame-

MA carried out the acquisition of data, sequence alignment, participated in recombination analyses and helped
to draft the manuscript. AC-R conceived and designed the
study, participated in the recombination analyses, performed data analysis and simulations and drafted the
manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
