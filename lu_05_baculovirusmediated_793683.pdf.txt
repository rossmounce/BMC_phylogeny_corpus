Abstract
Background: White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is an important pathogen of the penaeid shrimp
with high mortalities. In previous reports, Orf427 of WSSV is characterized as one of the three
major latency-associated genes of WSSV. Here, we were interested to analyze the promoter of
orf427 and its expression during viral pathogenesis.
Results: in situ hybridization revealed that orf427 was transcribed in all the infected tissues during
viral lytic infection and the translational product can be detected from the infected shrimp. A timecourse RT-PCR analysis indicated that transcriptional products of orf427 could only be detected
after 6 h post virus inoculation. Furthermore, a baculovirus-mediated promoter analysis indicated
that the promoter of orf427 failed to express the EGFP reporter gene in both insect SF9 cells and
primary shrimp cells.
Conclusion: Our data suggested that latency-related orf427 might not play an important role in
activating virus replication from latent phase due to its late transcription during the lytic infection.

Background
White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) was assigned to the
genus Whispovirus belonging to new family Nimaviridae in
the universal database of ICTV (International Committee
of Taxonomy of Viruses, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
ICTVdb/Ictv/index.htm). WSSV is probably the most
important pathogen of the cultured penaeid shrimp
resulting in high mortalities [1]. Even though WSSV represents one of the largest known animal viruses with a 305
kb double-stranded circular DNA genome, most of the
putative 185 ORFs bear no homology to known genes in
the GenBank [2,3]. The technical difficulty in characterization of the WSSV ORFs lies mainly in the lack of established shrimp cell lines for in vitro reproduction of the

virus [4]. During viral lytic infection, just as other DNA
viruses, the genes encoded by WSSV can be classified as
immediately early, delayed early, late and very late genes.
Most, if not all, immediate-early genes encode transcriptional regulation proteins. They are distinguished from
other viral genes by the fact that their transcription is independent of prior viral gene product expressed in transient
assays [5]. Although during the last decade, intensive
efforts have been undertaken for characterization of the
structural protein genes and a few non-structural protein
genes that show homology to known sequences in the
databases, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the WSSV life cycle and mode of
infection.

Recently, three viral transcripts (Orf427, Orf151 and
Orf366) and their corresponding DNA sequence have
been detected in both specific-pathogen-free (SPF)
shrimps and WSSV-infected shrimps through a WSSV-specific DNA microarray study. From this study, Orf427,
Orf151 and Orf366 were determined to be latency-associated genes of WSSV [6]. These data suggest that WSSV
remains latent in healthy shrimps. In a similar global
analysis, three immediately early (IE) genes (ie1, ie2, and
ie3) of WSSV were identified in infected shrimps [7]. Identification of the IE genes and latency-associated genes can
lead to better understanding of the life cycle of WSSV,
shedding light on the molecular mechanisms in WSSVinduced mortality. In a previous study, we have found
that latency-related ORF427 interacted with a shrimp protein phosphatase (PPs) [8]. To further characterize the
orf427 gene, we were interested to analyze the promoter of
orf427 and its expression during viral pathogenesis.

Results
To investigate whether promoter of orf427 is active without the existence of other viral proteins in the host cells,
we tried to establish in vitro culture of fragments from lymphoid organ as reported previously [9]. However, the primary shrimp cells were very sensitive to standard
liposome-based transfection reagents. Thus, for the promoter analysis, we employed a transduction method
mediated by baculovirus [10]. Recombinant baculoviruses bearing EGFP-expressing cassettes were produced
according to pFASTBac1 manufacturer instructions (Invitrogen) (Fig. 1A). Budded virus from insect cell culture
medium was concentrated by ultrafiltration and infectious titers of both stock viruses were determined by
plaque assay and adjusted to be 1010 plaque-forming units
(PFU)/ml.
Infection of SF9 cells and transduction of shrimp primary
cells with the recombinant baculovirses were carried out
at a MOI of 10 and 100, respectively. As expected, the ie1
promoter drove the expression of the egfp reporter gene in
both insect SF9 and the primary shrimp cells, as demonstrated by direct light and fluorescence microscopy; while
the orf427 promoter didn't express egfp to a detectable
level in either cell type (Fig. 1B and 1C). The expression of
GFP could be confirmed in both cells through immunoblot assay using monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 1D).
We also noticed that the primary shrimp cells could only
be transduced at a low percentage of about 5% (Fig. 1C).
In most cases, viruses establish latency in specific tissue(s). To test whether orf427 is transcribed only in specific latency sites or in all the tissues that support viral
infection, in situ hybridization was performed on paraffin
embedded tissue sections from shrimps at late infection
(4 days after viral inoculation) using DIG-labeled anti-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/71

sense RNA probes specific for orf427. Results shown in fig.
2 indicated that in contrast to the control shrimp sections,
orf427 was extensively transcribed in all the WSSV infected
tissue sections including subcuticular epithelium cells
(Fig. 2I), hemocytes lodged in the connective tissues (Fig.
2II), and stomach chamber lining cells (Fig. 2III). Also, we
expressed and purified partial fragment of ORF427 in a
GST-fusion form. Protein purity of the purified protein
was more than 90% as judged by SDS-PAGE (figure not
shown). Polyclonal antibody was developed by injection
of the protein into Guinea pigs. ORF427 can be detected
from homogenized infected shrimps through immunoblot assay using the anti-ORF427 antibody (Fig. 3).
In order to determine whether orf427 is transcribed in the
early phase during viral lytic infection, we employed a RTPCR approach to detect the transcriptional products of
orf427. The sequences of the primers used are shown in
Fig. 4A. P. monodon shrimps challenged through intramuscular injection with WSSV were sampled at different time
points after viral inoculation, and total RNAs were
extracted from the shrimp heads for RT-PCR analysis. As
controls, fragments corresponding to the WSSV immediately early gene ie1 [7], delayed early gene dnapol [11], and
late gene vp28 [12], were also amplified from the same
RNA samples. A shrimp β-actin primer set was used as an
internal control for RNA quality and amplification efficiency. Our results show that orf427 is only transcribed
after 6 h post infection (Fig. 4B), which is at the late phase
during viral lytic infection. As expected, ie1 can be
detected from 3 h p.i., while dnapol and vp28 can be
detected from 6 h p.i. (Fig. 4B).

Discussion
Establishment and maintenance of latency in the host
after primary infection have been investigated in some
well-studied DNA viruses such as: herpes simplex virus
(HSV) [13], human herpesvirus (HHV) [14], cytomegalovirus (CMV) [15], and Epstein-Barr virus [16]. However,
the molecular mechanisms that control virus latency and
reactivation remain to be elucidated. Because of problems
associated with conducting molecular studies in animals,
it has proven difficult for investigators to move beyond
phenomenal description and identification of latencyassociated transcripts (LATs). Most of the characterized
LATs were expressed at low levels during lytic replication
but were major transcripts during latent infection, and
their functions were not understood. These include a set
of latency-associated transcripts from the HHV-6 IE-A
region [17], a set of genes controlled by the Qp promoter
of Epstein-Barr virus [16], and latency-associated transcripts from both DNA strands in the ie1/ie2 region of
CMV [15]. U94 gene of HHV-6 is one of the better-characterized LATs. U94 protein acts as a transactivator by binding to a transcription factor and enables the establishment

and/or maintenance of latent infection at the primary
infection site like monocytes and early bone marrow progenitor cells [18]. Our data indicate that orf427 is a very
late gene during viral lytic infection, and this correlates
with the finding that ORF427 is not a transcriptional regulator, but a protein phosphatase-interacting protein [8].
Most recently, nuclear protein phosphatase-1 was
reported to regulate HIV-1 transcription both in vitro and
in vivo [19]. Primary functional dissection of Orf427 suggests that orf427 most likely encodes a calcium-binding
regulator of shrimp protein phosphatase, with the C terminus responsible for the binding of PPs (data not
shown). This suggests that orf427 is not necessary for viral
reactivation and only contributes to maintaining viral
latency by affecting the function of shrimp protein phosphatase. Similarly, the LAT gene of HSV-1 has been shown
to be dispensable for viral reactivation from latently
infected mouse dorsal root ganglia cultured in vitro [20].
The development of a continuous shrimp cell line in vitro
is urgently required for further characterization of WSSV
infection at the molecular and cellular levels. In recent
years, encouraging progress has been made in shrimp cell
culture using conventional primary culture techniques.

Several investigators have reported that WSSV infects the
primary cultures of lymphoid organs from the black tiger
shrimp, P. monodon; however, recent findings suggest that
the replication of WSSV in lymphoid organ primary cell is
low [4,9,21]. Besides this, the primary cell couldn't be
transfected with common liposome methods. We thus
took alternative approach to monitor the gene expression
in the primary shrimp cells. Recently AcMNPV
(Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus),
containing an appropriate eukaryotic promoter, was used
to efficiently transfer and express foreign genes in a variety
of mammalian cells and several animal models [22]. Considering that shrimp is more phylogenically related to
arthropods, the natural host of AcMNPV, we employed
recombinant baculovirus-mediated transduction to introduce foreign genes into the primary shrimp cells. As
expected, the primary shrimp cells were transduced in our
experiments; and the low transduction efficiency might be
due to the possible inhibition effect of L15 medium on
the attachment of baculovirus to the cell membrane (for
example, the pH value of medium for insect cells to
amplify baculovirus is 6.8, while the pH value of L15
medium is above 7.0). The transduction efficiency might
be significantly increased by using VSV-G-containing baculovirus as gene delivery vehicle [10]. The successful

transduction of cultured shrimp cells with recombinant
baculovirus may pave the way for the development of baculovirus-based vaccines for the shrimp farming industry.

Conclusion
The data presented here demonstrates that latency-associated Orf427 is only transcribed in the very late phase during viral lytic infection. In contrast to immediately early
promoters, the promoter of orf427 couldn't drive the
expression of an egfp reporter gene independently. Our
data suggest that as a very late protein during viral lytic
infection, ORF427 might only function in maintaining
WSSV in the latent phase but is not required for virus
reactivation.

Virus, shrimp, and cells
WSSV used in this study was isolated from Penaeus monodon shrimps, which were imported from Indonesia. Purification of the virus was performed as previously
described [6]. P. monodon shrimps challenged through
intramuscular injection were sampled at different time
points postinfection and immediately frozen and stored
at -80°C. Adult P. monodon shrimps weighing approximately 30–100 g were used for primary cell culture. Monolayer cell cultures from minced fragments of lymphoid
tissue were established as described by Chen [9]. Primary
cells were maintained in 2 × L15 medium from Invitrogen. Insect SF9 cells (Invitrogen) were maintained and
propagated in SF-900II serum-free medium (Invitrogen).
Infection of SF9 cells and transduction of foreign genes
into shrimp primary cells were performed as previously
described [10].
Construction of recombinant baculoviruses
The ie1 basic promoter region from -1 to -512 was amplified using primer set of 5'-TCCCTACGTATCAATTTTATGTGGCTAATGGAGA-3'
and
5'-ACGCGTCGA
CCTTGAGTGGAGAGAGAGCTAGTTATAA-3' [7]. To
make sure that the selected promoter region contained the
full orf427 promoter, the upstream sequence of orf427,
starting from -1 to -3500, was PCR-amplified from WSSV
genome with primer set of 5'-TCCCTACGTATGGGTCAGAAAAGAACCC-3' and 5'-ACGCGTCGACATC TCAAAGGTTGCCAATGACCAACAT-3'. Both promoters were
digested with SnaBI and SalI, and inserted into the
corresponding sites of shuttle vector pFastBac1 (Invitrogen). The EGFP cDNA was first cut with SalI and NotI from
the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech), followed by insertion
into the pFASTBac1 vector bearing the promoter sequence
of orf427 or ie1 gene. Recombinant baculoviruses bearing
the EGFP-expression cassette were constructed according
to the Bac-To-Bac protocol (Invitrogen). The infectious
titers of the recombinant baculoviruses were determined
by plaque assay with SF9 cells.
Development of polyclonal antibody and Western blot
analysis
The C terminal partial fragment amplified from orf427
template using primer pair of 5'-CGGGATCCGTTAGAGCTTCAAAGGTGGA-3'
and
5'-ACGCGTCGAC
TTATTTTCCTTGATCTAGAG-3' was inserted into the
pGEX4T-3 vector at BamH1 and Sal I site. The partial
ORF427 was expressed and purified in E. coli as a glutathione S-transfererase (GST) fusion protein according to
manufacturer's protol (Amersham Pharmacia). SPF
Guinea pigs were immunized and specific antisera were
prepared using standard procedures. Homogenized protein mixtures from infected shrimp or virus-infected cells
were harvested and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate

In situ hybridization
In situ hybridization was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections using a DIG-labeled antisense RNA
probes. Both WSSV-free shrimps and WSSV-infected
shrimps were fixed in 4% (W/V) paraformaldehyde
(PFA)-PBS, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 6 µm in thickness were made and attached to 3aminopropyltriethoxy-silane-coated slides. DIG-labeled
antisense riboprobe specific for orf427 was synthesized by
in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene) and 10 × Dig labeling mix (Roche). The transcription template was PCR amplified from orf427 with a
primer set of 5'-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGCACCAGAAGAAAGGGTCT-3', and 5'-AAGGAAAC CATCGAGGCCTT-3'. The T7 promoter sequence was flanked at the

5' of the reverse primer. Hybridization was performed in
50% formamide and 5 × SSC in a humified chamber at
60°C for 14–16 h (the background is too high at 50°C in
our hybridization system). The hybridization was
visualized by using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antidigoxigenin antibody.
RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted from heads of the WSSV-infected
shrimps using TRIzol-LS reagent (Life Technologies). For
RT-PCR, an aliquot of total RNA (20 µg) was treated with
200 U of RNase-free DNase I (Gibco BRL) at 37°C for 30
min to remove residual DNA. First strand cDNA synthesis
was performed using the oligo-dT primer, and 2 µl of the
cDNA was subjected to PCR in a 50 µl reaction mixture.
