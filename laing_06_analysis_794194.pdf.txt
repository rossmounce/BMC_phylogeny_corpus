Background

in different conditions to provide insight into the function of
specific genes. Additionally, in prokaryotic organisms, the
relationships inferred from gene co-expression should also
provide clues to the organization of genes into operons and
regulons. Since operons are, by definition, a transcriptional
unit containing genes that are co-regulated as a single polycistronic message, they are, therefore, deemed to be

information

The analysis of gene expression patterns observed over a
range of conditions and time points has become widely used
in modern biology to discover relationships between different
genes in a genome. This can involve clustering genes into coexpressed sets to try and predict common functions and regulatory relationships, or to determine differential expression

interactions

Conclusion: Here we have demonstrated a polarity of expression in operons of S. coelicolor not
seen in E. coli, bringing caution to those that apply operon prediction strategies based on E. coli
'equal-expression' to divergent species. We speculate that this general difference in transcription
behavior could reflect the contrasting lifestyles of the two organisms and, in the case of
Streptomyces, might also be influenced by its high G+C content genome. Identification of putative
internal promoters, previously thought to cause problems in operon prediction strategies, has also
been enabled.

refereed research

Results: To investigate the relative transcript levels of intra-operonic genes, we have used a Zscore approach to normalize the expression levels of all genes within an operon to expression of
the first gene of that operon. Here we demonstrate that there is a general downward trend in
expression from the first to the last gene in Streptomyces coelicolor operons, in contrast to what we
observe in Escherichia coli. Combining transcription-factor binding-site prediction with the
identification of operonic genes that exhibited higher transcript levels than the first gene of the
same operon enabled the discovery of putative internal promoters. The presence of transcription
terminators and abundance of putative transcriptional control sequences in S. coelicolor operons are
also described.

deposited research

Background: Recent studies have shown that microarray-derived gene-expression data are useful
for operon prediction. However, it is apparent that genes within an operon do not conform to the
simple notion that they have equal levels of expression.

functionally similar. Hence, an understanding of operon
structure and regulation forms a basis on which to build regulatory networks.
Given the importance of operons to prokaryotic gene function
and regulation, several approaches have been developed to
try and predict them, exploiting genome sequences and other
related features. As operon structure has been observed to be
relatively poorly conserved [1-4] non-homology based prediction of operons has predominated. These methods use the
basic principles that genes within the same operon are controlled by a single promoter, tend to be close together [5], terminate at a single transcription terminator, and are
transcribed at similar levels. Several groups have developed
computational methods to predict operons that adopt these
principles, either through the use of sequence information
alone [6] or by combining it with microarray data [7,8] and/
or by including functional annotation [5,9-11] in Escherichia
coli or Bacillus subtilis. The use of microarray data and/or
functional data improves the quality of operon prediction
above that achieved from sequence alone and in addition
offers some experimental validation of the predictions
[7,8,11].
Through the presence of a promoter(s) and other regulatory
features such as cis-acting transcription factor-binding sites
upstream of the first gene of an operon, it is generally
assumed that genes within an operon are expressed at equal
levels. Typically, this equal expression is measured through
distance metrics such as Pearson correlation or Euclidean
distance where a score of 1 or 0 (respectively) is considered to
be more likely with operonic pairs than non-operonic pairs.
Indeed, recent studies in E. coli [8] and B. subtilis [7] have
shown that this is the case, with operonic pairs of genes showing high correlation in gene expression using either metric.
However, although microarray data are useful in predicting
operons, the ideal condition of perfectly correlated gene
expression, even within well characterized operons, is not
observed experimentally, and the distinction between operonic and non-operonic pairs is not straightforward.

In the light of these findings we were motivated to analyze the
patterns of expression across documented operons in Streptomyces coelicolor, an actinomycete with a high G+C content
genome that is responsible for the production of about twothirds of all natural antibiotics currently available, and to
compare them with our knowledge of known E. coli operons.
This was driven from an interest in S. coelicolor itself, which
is a complex bacterium equipped with an unusually large
number of transcription factors, including 65 sigma factors
[12], and also to provide a third, phylogenetically diverse,
bacterial species in which to examine operon-expression relationships. Furthermore, we use the determined pattern of
expression across operons to identify potential internal cisacting control sites by combining microarray-derived expression profiles with transcription factor binding site (TFBSs)
and terminator prediction algorithms. This study reveals that
the control of gene expression in operons in Streptomyces
differs from, and is more complex than that observed in E.
coli and B. subtilis, and is likely to demonstrate more internal
control.

Results and discussion

In order to compare expression levels of genes within operons, we considered several metrics, concluding that the Pearson correlation coefficient provides a superior measure of the
direction or change in gene expression over a set of experiments. This has also been observed by other workers [7] and
suggests that the gene expression profiles of operonic members are co-ordinated (that is, go up and down in a correlated
fashion) but not necessarily in terms of absolute expression
level. This idea is illustrated in Figure 1, which depicts the
normalized expression profile of 107 experiments for each of
the four genes found within the known S. coelicolor rspL-tuf1
operon [13]. Figure 1 illustrates cases where genes in the same
operon have similar trajectory patterns over a variety of
experiments, but varying expression levels for individual
experiments.
When the normalized expression levels of genes within operons are compared in S. coelicolor and E. coli (Figure 2a,c), the
intra-operonic pairs show a higher degree of correlation than
those not in operons, using either of our definitions for nonoperonic (either through direction, or crossing a true operon
boundary). For example, the mean correlation values in S.
coelicolor are 0.34, 0.26, 0.14 for known operons, non-operons (via direction), and non-operons (via boundaries),
respectively. The equivalent values in E. coli are 0.74, 0.53,
0,54. However, the trend is more marked between known
operonic gene pairs and randomly selected gene pairs (p <
0.01 after t test; Figure 2b,d). Interestingly, the most significant trend is noted between random gene pairs in E. coli and
S. coelicolor, where randomly selected gene pairs are significantly (p < 0.01 after t test) more highly correlated than with
mean correlation coefficients of 0.4 and 0.06, respectively
(Figure 2b,d). This is also backed up by Figure 2e, which

shows that the closer gene pairs are together (using adjacent
gene pairs on the same strand in the genome), the stronger
the correlation in their expression profiles, independent of
their operonic status. Again, the similarity in gene expression
between adjacent genes transcribed in the same direction is
much larger in E. coli compared to S. coelicolor (Figure 3e).
This has important implications for operon prediction methods that use microarray data directly or to validate predictions [7,8,11,14] because, particularly in E. coli, gene
proximity is highly correlated with co-expression regardless
of whether the genes are members of the same operon.
Taken together, these results suggest that control of genes
within characterized operons in S. coelicolor is more complex, and that the regulation of expression at adjacent loci is
more diverse than in E. coli. Indeed, the large differences in
gene expression patterns observed between the two species
were unexpected and we tested for bias in the data sets that
might cause this. However, we found no systematic differences in the number and type of experiments (time-course
derived data and/or single perturbations) or absence of variation of individual gene expression (measured by an entropy
value, (E Laing and S Hubbard, unpublished data)) that
would lead to higher correlations. Indeed, the latter entropy
calculations suggested there is more variation in the E. coli
data sets. The apparent increased complexity of genetic control in S. coelicolor might explain this, given the larger, more
complex genome and increased number of transcription
factors.
There is, nevertheless, increased correlation in gene expression for operonic members (Figure 2a,c) and for this reason
we analyzed expression patterns of documented operons in S.
coelicolor and E. coli. Using a Z-score normalization procedure (see Materials and methods), gene expression across an
operon is normalized to the first gene of the same operon,
which allows individual gene expression patterns both within
and across operons to be compared. For every position i
within an operon the distribution of Zop,i for operonic genes at
position i can then be plotted, such that a box in the plots
illustrated in Figure 3a-d represents a gene position in a 'virtual' operon. Figure 3a shows a box plot of Zop,i values for each
gene position in operons in S. coelicolor, restricted to five due
to lack of experimental data for larger operons. Figure 3a suggests that operons in S. coelicolor exhibit 'polar' expression,
whereby gene expression generally decreases throughout the
operon, with successive genes having lower expression levels
than the preceding gene. This does not correspond to the
common notion that operonic genes are expressed equally.
This apparent downward trend was tested by randomly shuffling gene order in the same operon set using 1,000 simulations, which showed that when the order of the genes in an
operon are changed no polarity of expression is observed
(data not shown). Using the random (shuffled) Zop,i distributions for each position, p values were obtained. Although no
significance less than p < 0.05 was observed for individual

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/6/R46

positions compared to random, the deviations from expectation for individual genes in given operons is significant, with
Z-values exceeding 20 in many instances. We suggest that the
downward trend of expression is a characteristic of S. coelicolor operons.
It is evident that some genes do not follow the trend of downward expression observed in Streptomyces operons in Figure
3a. One possible explanation for this increased expression is
the presence of internal promoters, a feature that is thought
to cause problems in operon prediction methods [6-8,11,14].
Although the prediction of promoter sequences is difficult,
TFBSs in prokaryotes tend to be proximal to a promoter [15]
and potential internal promoters were assayed by the identification of a putative TFBS. Intra-operonic genes (excluding
the initial gene of an operon) were classed as either over-represented intra-operonic genes (OIGs) with a Zop,i greater than
the µop,1 + σop,1 or non-over-represented intra-operonic genes
(NOIGs) with a Zop,i less than the µop,1 - σop,1. The abundance
of TFBSs within their upstream intergenic regions was studied (Figure 4). Figure 4 shows that there is a consistent overrepresentation of TFBSs in the OIGS set for Streptomyces,
not present in randomly selected genes from the same operon
set, with a p < 0.05 from a chi-square test using TFBS prediction thresholds mb + nσb (n = 4, 4.5, and 5).
The TFBS prediction algorithm uses position specific weight
matrices (PSWMs) to predict likely sites in the upstream
regions of candidate genes. Some genes do not possess substantial upstream non-coding sequence, and hence these
genes were filtered out in the TFBS tests shown in Figure 4 in
order to remove any potential bias. However, the gene hisB
(SCO2052) is known to have an internal promoter upstream
in E. coli but has no upstream intergenic sequence in S.
coelicolor, overlapping the upstream neighboring gene by
four bases. This gene was originally assigned to the upregulated set prior to filtering and is, therefore, predicted to be
internally promoted, although our approach would not
attempt to find a putative TFBS. A substantial proportion of
the gene sets fall into this category; 48% of the upregulated
data set and 27% of the normal data set had no upstream
intergenic sequence. The upregulated genes that fall into this
category may well be similar cases in which internal transcription initiation occurs but the internal promoter lies in an
intragenic upstream sequence. The significant difference
between TFBS abundance for upregulated and normal genes
using this method would suggest that TFBS prediction algorithms capable of analyzing overlapping upstream regions
should be developed.
There are several reasons why NOIGs have TFBSs identified
by our prediction methods: first, it could be that those genes
in the majority of cases do not show any upregulation in our
restricted experiments but there are conditions when they are
upregulated; second, the promoter is unregulated and constitutive activity only enables the gene to reach basal expression

Transcription factor binding site prediction threshold

information

The fact that thrB was identified as an OIG and a TFBS was
also predicted is promising for operon prediction algorithm
improvement, since thrB is expressed independently in

interactions

Only 4 of 55 NOIGs were predicted to have a binding site with
a threshold of mb + 5σb; SCO3358 (cseB), SCO2610 (mreC),
SCO5319 (whiE protein II), and SCO5625 (tsf). No additional
information about the transcriptional status of SCO2610 or
SCO5319 could be found and, consequently, information for
the two remaining genes is briefly discussed here. SCO3358 is
the third gene of the sigE operon, an operon that has been
found to be entirely transcribed only 10% of the time due to
termination downstream of the first gene sigE [19]. In agreement with this, SCO3358 has reduced expression compared
to the first gene of the operon. The binding site we predicted
upstream of SCO3358 (cseB) may offer an additional route to
activate this gene in the operon, as the product of SCO3358
regulates the upstream promoter of the operon [19].
SCO5625 (tsf), is the second gene of a bicistronic operon and
is expressed less than the first gene (rpsB) by a ratio of 2:1 in
S. coelicolor [13], consistent with the array data presented
here. However, the authors of this work [13] could not deduce
the likely mechanism and speculated that attenuation, if
occurring, may be brought about by a 16 base-pair inverted

repeat just upstream of tsf in S. coelicolor, similar to that
found in E. coli. Alternatively, a similar attenuation mechanism in S. coelicolor to that proposed for the rpsB-tsf operon
of Spiroplasma citri may be responsible, where a DNA binding protein interacts with the region immediately downstream of rpsB [20]. The binding site found to be bound by a
protein just upstream of tsf (although how it would influence
transcription is not known) by Le Dantec et al. [20] was an
AT-rich inverted repeat that did not resemble a typical terminator sequence. Interestingly, the inverted repeat predicted
by our method to be in the upstream region of tsf is also ATrich. From the 23 OIGs, 5 genes were predicted to have a
TFBS (using the threshold of mb + 5σb); SCO2389 (acpP),
SCO0712 (lipR), SCO2390 (fabF), SCO4662 (tuf1), and
SCO5356 (thrB). Table 1 details known information about the
regulation of these genes, where all but one of the OIGs with
predicted binding sites are known to have a promoter in their
upstream regions. Although formally classified as a monocistronic operon in Streptomyces, thrB is included as it is transcriptionally linked to a bicistronic operon involved in the
same pathway immediately upstream in E. coli, and often
part of an operon in other organisms (for example, B. subtilis)
[21].

a phenomenon found in Spiroplasma citri [17]; fourth, experimental error, where expression measurements in the profile
are less than the true biological amount; or fifth, due to false
positives within our TFBS set, although few false positives are
expected at the prediction threshold of mb + 5σb [18].

Streptomyces. Additionally, tuf1 in Streptomyces ramocissimus was found to have a TFBS characterized by an inverted
repeat upstream of the internal promoter [22], which is speculated to play a role in promoter activation; the promoter
sequence, although 'weak' [22], is highly conserved across different strains of streptomycetes, suggesting it plays an important role. Interestingly, the TFBS inverted repeat predicted
here in S. coelicolor is very similar to the one found in S. ramocissimus, suggesting that the mechanism for internal upregulation of tuf1 is conserved.
In contrast to the situation observed in S. coelicolor, no bias
towards increased abundance of TFBSs in OIGs is seen in E.
coli (Figure 4c,d), again suggesting that there is a general difference in transcriptional regulation between the two species.
Of the 65 experimentally validated internal promoter sites (as
annotated in RegulonDB [23,24]) within our constructed
operon set for E. coli (Additional data file 1) 37% of proximal
downstream genes (to the promoter) were classed as OIGs by
our method using a restricted set of experiments. Of these, 12
genes had upstream intergenic regions that could be tested
for TFBSs. Using the TFBS prediction threshold of mb + 5σb,
we compared the two sets of PSWMs (see Materials and
methods) at finding these known sites. Only 1 site (8%) of the
possible 12 was correctly predicted by the matrices built by Li
and co-workers [18], whilst our matrices identified 5 (42%).
In addition to known sites, our matrices predicted 22 other
putative internal control sites in E. coli operons (compared to
17 by Li and co-workers matrices [18]), 4 of which are documented in RegulonDB [23,24] as being predicted by computational methods. A complete list of the predicted internal
promoters in E. coli is given in Additional data file 2.
To further test the internal promoter predictions, box plots
were made of the mean expression of all the operonic genes
upstream and downstream of the putative internal promoter
in this restricted set of S. coelicolor operons, after normalizing to the first gene of the operon (Figure 5a). In total, 80% of
the mean values for genes downstream of the predicted internal promoter have a higher expression compared to the mean
values for genes upstream, indicating enhancement of
expression due to presence of the promoter (as expected). As
a control, when selecting the same number of genes randomly

from all of the documented S. coelicolor operons and randomly splitting them into upstream and downstream genes
(following 1,000 simulations) only 32% were upregulated
(Figure 5b). The same trend in E. coli is not observed, with
higher expression observed downstream of the internal promoter in 57% of cases compared to 49% in equivalent random
tests (Figure 5c,d).
Internal termination could also play an important role in the
control of individual gene expression within operons. Hence,
one might expect NOIGs to have a greater abundance of terminators in their upstream regions than OIGs. The prediction
of rho-dependent terminators is a difficult task due to the
diversity of structures bound by the rho-factor and, therefore,
only rho-independent terminators were considered here.
Although rho-independent terminator prediction algorithms
have been developed by several groups (for example, [25-27])
the %G+C richness of the S. coelicolor genome (approximately 72%) and the phylogenetic similarity of S. coelicolor
and M. tuberculosis [12] suggested the use of GeSTer [28].
This algorithm is not dependent on the presence of a U-rich
tail following a stem-loop, which might be expected to be
absent in S. coelicolor. Permitting stem-loops to be sited up to
300 bases downstream of a gene's stop codon, along with
GeSTer's default settings [28], resulted in 3,365 predicted
terminators. Only about 8% had a U-rich tail, agreeing with
expectations. We used the distance between the end of a gene
and the start of the stem-loop (GDSL) as a potential metric to
reduce false positives, and counted intra-operonic genes from
the OIG and NOIG sets with predicted terminators in the
upstream intergenic regions. Figure 6 shows the fraction of
intra-operonic genes with predicted terminators within the
OIG and NOIG sets, excluding the first gene in each operon,
which would be expected to have a terminator upstream
considering that only 27% of upstream intergenic regions in
S. coelicolor are divergent.
Regardless of expression status, very few intra-operonic
genes are predicted to have an upstream terminator (maximum of about 32% when considering the entire intergenic
region). The propensity of genes with predicted terminators
for NOIG to OIG are shown in Figure 6, and varies between
0.5 and 2.3. The only clear signal differing from random is

Finally, to gain some insight into the complexity of intraoperonic gene regulation, intra-operonic genes were split
using a TFBS prediction threshold of mb + 5σb and a basic
GDSL threshold of 0, to yield four different classes as defined
in Table 2: type 1 and type 2 are likely to represent OIGs due
to the presence of an upstream TFBS, given what is observed
in Figure 4; type 3 are expected to be NOIGs due to the presence of an upstream terminator but the absence of a putative
TFBS; and type 4 should represent the majority of genes if
there is to be any agreement with the basic operon model as
proposed by Jacob and Monod [29]. The proportion of genes
falling into each class split into OIGs and NOIGs is also shown
in Table 2. Encouragingly, approximately 80% do not have a
predicted TFBS or terminator site. Although this is expected

Propensities were calculated by dividing the fraction of OIGs or NOIGs
with a predicted terminator by the fraction of all genes that were OIGs or
NOIGs in this restricted 78 gene subset. This was done for non-inclusive
10 base-pair regions moving out from the stop codon of the previous
gene. Random values were estimated by random picking from the 78 gene
intra-operonic set to represent the OIG and NOIG expressed data sets,
repeating 1,000 times.

terintuitive, we believe this reflects the need to regulate certain genes within an operon independently, which may
require the presence of an internal upstream terminator and
promoter, as well as a terminator downstream of the gene.
This would in effect 'isolate' the gene, allowing its expression
independently of the whole operon (where physiological conditions might dictate this). Indeed, we see a similar enrichment for OIGs with a higher propensity for downstream
terminators too (1.7 compared to 0.7 for NOIGs). This suggests a more complex mechanism for the regulation and
expression of some genes within operons, involving both
internal transcriptional initiation and termination.

to be an overestimate, it is not likely to be a large one given the
low false negative rate expected from use of the TFBS matrices (approximately 2%). Furthermore, the majority of type 4
genes are NOIGs and, therefore, have reduced expression
compared to the first gene in the operon. This suggests that
although internal regulation (promotion and termination)
plays an important role in the control of gene expression of
genes within some operons, this is by no means a universal
mechanism. However, we do expect that some internal TFBSs
are missed by current algorithms (about 20% of the genes
classed as type 4 are upregulated, although no internal sites
could be detected). It is estimated, therefore, that 'internal'
gene regulation is likely to operate on 20% to 40% of operonic
genes, based on the data currently available.
Interestingly, those genes that have both a TFBS and terminator predicted in their upstream regions (type 1) make up 9%
of operonic genes and seem to be mostly upregulated, with a
OIG:NOIG ratio of 1.3. This is consistent with the 'isolated'
gene expression hypothesis, where both an internal promoter
and terminator are required to express this gene independently from the rest of the operon. In addition, there appear to
be very few genes in this dataset (3%) that have a TFBS and
no terminator (type 2), suggesting that genes that have an
upstream TFBS site also have a terminator present, allowing
for a tighter control of expression.

Conclusion

Although the co-regulation of genes in prokaryotes has been
shown to be highly conserved in some cases when comparing
operonic gene pairs from one organism to the regulon map of
another [30], inter-species operon structure is generally not
stable [1-4,31]. Instability of operons and, therefore, operonic
regulation through the addition, removal, and reorganization
of genes during long-term evolution as well as different physiological and developmental states [31] can produce a variety
of control mechanisms. Furthermore, it has previously been
suggested that patterns of gene co-regulation could be specific to the organism or a set of closely related organisms [32].
Here we provide evidence that demonstrates large differences
in the general regulatory mechanisms that S. coelicolor and E.
coli use to control gene expression within operons. This is
apparent through the different relative expression patterns
across operons and differences in abundance of predicted

TFBSs within operons, pointing to different levels of intraoperonic gene regulation between the two species. This raises
a note of caution for those attempting to predict operons
through the use of expression similarity in other species.
Given the dynamistic nature of orthologous genes' operonic
organization and differences in their regulation, we cannot
expect expression across operons to be similar either.
Operons in S. coelicolor exhibit a polarity in expression that
is not observed in E. coli. When considering the minimum
and maximum values obtained for each gene position within
an operon (Figure 3), it could also be seen that E. coli genes
have a tighter distribution of Zop,i values than S. coelicolor.
However, this corresponds to a mixture of functionally equivalent and non-equivalent operon examples. It could be
argued that equivalent operons between species that function
in a similar response/pathway may have similar regulatory
elements and/or expression patterns. An examination of
existing comparable data sets suggests otherwise. When comparing documented operons in E. coli and the orthologous
operons in S. coelicolor (defined as containing at least one
equivalent gene, yielding a total of 15 pairs matched by gene
name), general expression across the operons is different
(Figure 7). Using expression data from all available
experimental sets, the downward 5' to 3' directionality in
expression is retained in S. coelicolor operons, but is not
shared by orthologous operons in E. coli. This has been
observed previously when differences in the regulation of
orthologous operons across many organisms were characterized [1,30], although not from levels of expression across
operons.
The co-transcription of genes in operons allows concerted
expression of gene products involved in the same response/
pathway [33,34]. However, our data demonstrates a marked
polarity of expression in S. coelicolor operons. The concept of
polarity is not new; as early as 1979, Ullman and colleagues
[35] discussed operon polarity as a "salient feature of
prokaryotic gene expression, where promoter-distal genes
have reduced expression compared to promoter-proximal
genes most likely caused by premature termination". This
may be caused by a variety of mechanisms, including environmental factors, absence of termination suppressors, and the
possible presence of the rho-factor [35]. A further factor is
differential mRNA degradation, where genes closer to the 3'

Positive and negative examples of operons

coli K12 strain MG1655 from GenBank [54,55] [GenBank:NC_000913] and the S. coelicolor chromosome (not

information

An advantage of operon structure is that, in the majority of
cases, all the genes within an operon encode proteins that are
needed within the same pathway/response. For S. coelicolor,
where specialized responses are elicited under certain conditions, specialized promoters within operons would also be an

reports

Although it is not clear from the data presented here which, if
any, of these mechanisms is responsible for the differential
patterns observed in S. coelicolor operons, it is interesting to
compare gene expression differences already characterized
between S. coelicolor and E. coli. S. coelicolor has an estimated 12.3% of 7,825 genes involved in regulation [12] whilst
E. coli has 7.2% of 4,829 genes [37], agreeing with the observation that the proportion of genes involved in regulation
increases with bacterial genome size [38]. Furthermore, S.
coelicolor has a large number of sigma factors (65) compared
to E. coli's 6. Based on these figures alone we would expect a
greater diversity of regulation in S. coelicolor than in E. coli.
A good example of this greater diversity in S. coelicolor is the
specialization of stress regulons, where each is thought to be
controlled by a specific sigma factor or multiple regulatory
genes with very few induced proteins being shared between
stress responses [12,39]. In contrast, in E. coli, sigma 38
(RpoS) brings on a general response to starvation, osmotic,
oxidative, and heat stresses [39]. Streptomycetes inhabit
highly diverse and dynamic soil and aquatic environments
and, as sessile saprophytic organisms, need to constantly
modulate gene expression levels to adapt to these changes
and modify their metabolism appropriately. This could have
led to the development of a more 'punctuated' and flexible
transcriptional organization. In this context we also speculate
on the potential influence of the high G+C content of Streptomyces on the evolution of operons and intra-operon control.
The topological consequences of a high G+C (72%) genome
might have favored the evolution of 'operons' that can be
transcribed segmentally to perhaps modulate torsional stress.

Comparative gene expression for orthologous operons
Comparative gene expression for orthologous operons. Boxplot of Zop,i
scores are shown for orthologous operons, where at least one gene is the
same in a documented S. coelicolor compared to E. coli. Data are shown in
E. coli (EC) and S. coelicolor (SC) using all available experiments.

Finally, we have shown that 60% to 80% of S. coelicolor intraoperonic genes defined in this study did not have any putative
internal control sites upstream. Although this represents the
majority of the operonic genes, it has serious implications for
operon prediction methods. These methods often use the
presence of promoters and/or terminators at the start and/or
end of an operon as signals to delineate operon boundaries,
and clearly in the cases of S. coelicolor this is likely to cause
mis-prediction of operon membership. The consideration of
internal control sites within operons has not yet been implemented in these approaches, and could lead to improvements
for some species. Here, we have shown that the use of acrossoperon expression levels combined with TFBSs and terminator prediction is a strategy capable of allowing for such sites.
Work to produce an operon prediction tool that integrates
these different sources of information is on-going in our
laboratory.

advantage. Indeed, where an increase in expression greater
than the expression of the first gene in the operon is needed,
we found evidence for a significant abundance of internal
promoters in S. coelicolor, something not seen in E. coli.

5) and from the transcriptional unit annotation in EcoCyc for
E. coli [58,59] (Additional data file 6). Negative examples of
operons were collected from knowledge of basic operon structure applicable to both organisms (Figure 8). Assuming that
the entire polycistronic transcript is documented, non-operons of length 2 were formed by using the initial gene of the
operon and its upstream neighboring gene if that neighbor is
transcribed in the same direction (for example, gene pair de), and the last gene in the documented operon and its downstream neighboring gene, again if it is transcribed in the same
direction (for example, gene pair g-h). To increase the size of
the non-operonic data set a non-operon of length 3 was also
formed by collecting triplets of genes that are transcribed in
the opposite direction (for example, genes b-c-d). In total, 35
operons and 1,282 non-operons were collected for S. coelicolor, and 325 operons and 821 non-operons were collected
for E. coli.

TFBS prediction
Lists of putative TFBSs for both S. coelicolor and E. coli were
collected by searching upstream intergenic regions for overrepresented dimers using the method of Li et al. [18], searching against the same E. coli K12 strain MG1655 from GenBank
[54,55] and S. coelicolor chromosome from EMBL [56,57].
This method defines putative TFBSs as PSWMs for each putative site, based on the statistical over-representation of
dimeric words (dyads) in defined sequence sets. Our implementation of this method yielded slightly different results
from the published ones; however, we used both sets of
TFBSs for E. coli - the published TFBSs of Li et al. [18], giving
849 putative sites, and the TFBSs collected with our implementation of Li et al.'s method [18], resulting in 1,506 putative sites. Comparisons between the two data sets were
performed and we were able to find all of those published by
Li et al. [18] plus additional sites and we therefore use this as
an alternative set. For S. coelicolor, a TFBS list was built by
searching upstream of all genes on the chromosome and
applying the same method [60], resulting in 3,628 putative
sites defined by PSWMs. Here we define 'upstream' as the
maximum of 300 nucleotides or the intergenic distance to the
stop codon of the previous gene. Previous work applying a
similar approach on S. coelicolor [60] reported 2,497 putative
TFBSs. However, using dyad word lengths of 3 to 5 nucleotides instead of 4 nucleotides results in additional matrices,
as well as all of the matrices found previously [60].

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/6/R46

Hence, for each putative TFBS the defining sequences can be
matched back against the PSWM, resulting in a mean score
md with standard deviation σd. Similarly, a mean score mb
with standard deviation σb is obtained matching the PSWM
against background sequences (all upstream sequences) as
described in Li et al. [18]. For a sequence to be predicted to
contain a given TFBS, the score of the sequence against the
PSWM must be higher than md - 2σd and mb + xσb, where x is
used to represent trials of different thresholds as discussed
later in this report; since this is the only part of the threshold
that changes, the TFBS prediction threshold used will be represented by mb + xσb.

Normalization of microarray data
A per-chip normalization strategy was used throughout. This
was found to be the best normalization strategy with regards
to operon prediction, since the general trajectory of expression is retained. Hence, all log2 expression ratios for each
experiment in the microarray data sets collected for S. coelicolor and E. coli were calculated as follows:
gi, j = log 2 (

expression _ ratio _ of _ gene _ i _ in _ experiment_j
)
Median _ of _ all _ expression _ ratios _ in _ experiment_j

We define the expression level of each gene in a given operon
of m genes as gi for i = 1, m. As the first gene of an operon (g1)
is the first to be transcribed it is expected that the transcription level of the downstream genes should be equal to the
expression of g1 (given the expectation that they are co-transcribed in a single polycistronic unit) and, therefore, the
expression level of g1 is taken as a representative of the
operon's expression level (µop,1). Using all available experiments (j) µop,1 is calculated by:
n

µop,1 =

∑ g1, j

j =0

n

Where n = total number of experiments (107 for S. coelicolor
and 145 for E. coli). µop,1 has a standard deviation associated
with it (σop,1):
n

∑

σ op,1 =

( gi , j − µop,1 )2

j =0

n −1

Each gene in an operon (gi) can then be expressed as a Zscore, normalizing its value of expression compared to the
µop,1, Zop,i can then be calculated:

Z op,i =

using our own PSWMs, their Zop,i score (in comparison to the
first gene of the respective operon) and whether they are
experimentally known (or computationally predicted); the
bottom table describes E. coli OIGs predicted to have an
upstream internal promoter using Li et al. [18] matrices.
Additional data file 3 lists the SMD Experiment IDs used for
S. coelicolor. Additional data file 4 lists the Oklahoma database experiment IDs and SMD Experiment IDs used for E.
coli. Additional data file 5 documents experimentally validated operons used in this analysis for S. coelicolor. Additional data file 6 documents experimentally validated
operons used in this analysis for E. coli.

comment

with an expectation that genes should have small Z-scores
close to 0 if the measured expression of every gene in an
operon is truly uniform. In addition, this procedure facilitates
cross-operon comparison by normalizing the expression of
the first gene in every operon to 0.
