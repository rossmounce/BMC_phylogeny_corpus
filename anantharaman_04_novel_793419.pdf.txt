Abstract
Background: The emergence of eukaryotes was characterized by the expansion and
diversification of several ancient RNA-binding domains and the apparent de novo innovation of new
RNA-binding domains. The identification of these RNA-binding domains may throw light on the
emergence of eukaryote-specific systems of RNA metabolism.
Results: Using sensitive sequence profile searches, homology-based fold recognition and
sequence-structure superpositions, we identified novel, divergent versions of the Sm domain in the
Scd6p family of proteins. This family of Sm-related domains shares certain features of conventional
Sm domains, which are required for binding RNA, in addition to possessing some unique conserved
features. We also show that these proteins contain a second previously uncharacterized C-terminal
domain, termed the FDF domain (after a conserved sequence motif in this domain). The FDF
domain is also found in the fungal Dcp3p-like and the animal FLJ22128-like proteins, where it fused
to a C-terminal domain of the YjeF-N domain family. In addition to the FDF domains, the FLJ22128like proteins contain yet another divergent version of the Sm domain at their extreme N-terminus.
We show that the YjeF-N domains represent a novel version of the Rossmann fold that has
acquired a set of catalytic residues and structural features that distinguish them from the
conventional dehydrogenases.
Conclusions: Several lines of contextual information suggest that the Scd6p family and the Dcp3plike proteins are conserved components of the eukaryotic RNA metabolism system. We propose
that the novel domains reported here, namely the divergent versions of the Sm domain and the
FDF domain may mediate specific RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions in cytoplasmic
ribonucleoprotein complexes. More specifically, the protein complexes containing Sm-like domains
of the Scd6p family are predicted to regulate the stability of mRNA encoding proteins involved in
cell cycle progression and vesicular assembly. The Dcp3p and FLJ22128 proteins may localize to the
cytoplasmic processing bodies and possibly catalyze a specific processing step in the decapping
pathway. The explosive diversification of Sm domains appears to have played a role in the
emergence of several uniquely eukaryotic ribonucleoprotein complexes, including those involved
in decapping and mRNA stability.

Background
Systematic comparative analyses of genome sequences
have suggested that the majority of domains found in proteins involved in RNA metabolism are drawn from a relatively small set of conserved domains (approximately
100–135) [1-3]. The proteins containing these conserved
domains correspond to around 4 to 11 percent of the protein-coding genes in cellular life forms and perform a wide
range of functions that include translation and its regulation, processing and modification of cellular RNAs, and
post-transcriptional gene regulation [1-3]. This set of conserved domains can be broadly divided into those that
mediate interactions with RNAs or other proteins in ribonucleoprotein complexes, and catalytic domains that may
catalyze a wide range of reactions related to RNA or associated proteins. Most of the common RNA-binding
domains (RBDs) are relatively small (less than 150 residues) and tend to be evolutionarily mobile, occurring as
solos, or in combination with other RBDs or enzymatic
domains [1]. Several RBDs as well as the catalytic domains
of RNA metabolism enzymes are amongst the most highly
conserved and universally distributed protein domains in
cellular organisms. These highly conserved domains are
typically present in ribosomal components, translation
factors, enzymes that modify rRNA and tRNA, polyadenylation, and transcription elongation factors [1,4,5].
However, the analysis of phyletic patterns of conserved
domains has also suggested that a significant innovation
of novel RBDs occurred at the base of eukaryotes [1].
These eukaryotic innovations include the PAZ, G-Patch,
PWI and SWAP domains and several Zn-chelating
domains, such as the Zn-knuckle, the CCCH and LRP fingers [1,6-8]. The emergence of these domains, as well as
the expansion and diversification of superfamilies of previously existing domains appears to have accompanied
development of several novel aspects of RNA metabolism
in the eukaryotes. These unique eukaryotic aspects include
pathways involved in pre-mRNA splicing, capping, posttranscriptional gene silencing and nucleo-cytoplasmic
RNA transport. The eukaryotes also possess more complex
versions of RNA degradation and processing systems, such
as the exosome and the multi-subunit RNaseP/RNase
MRP [1,9,10]. Hence, the identification of novel eukaryote-specific domains, as well as the analysis of the diversification of ancient domain superfamilies in eukaryotes
may help in providing a better understanding of the origins and the biochemical properties of the unique aspects
their RNA metabolism.
The computational identification of conserved RNA-binding domains (RBDs) has considerably contributed to the
analysis of RNA-protein interactions in various pathways
of RNA metabolism [1,6,11-13]. The enzymatic domains
associated with RNA metabolism typically belong to
superfamilies, which may also include members that act

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/45

on substrates outside the context of RNA metabolism (eg.
Rossmann fold methyltransferases acting on non-ribonucleoprotein substrates) [1]. Hence, the combinations of
RBDs and enzymatic domains in the same polypeptide
provide a strong contextual handle for predicting novel
catalytic activities associated with RNA metabolism. Comprehensive analysis of the commonly occurring domains
involved in RNA metabolism has previously helped in
identifying several such domain architectures that led to
the prediction of novel RNA and RNP modifying/processing enzymes [1,6,14,15]. The recent increase in the available genomic sequences from eukaryotes provides further
opportunities to extract contextual information in the
form of previously unnoticed domain architectures. Furthermore, the new data also allows the detection of less
common, nevertheless functionally important eukaryotespecific domains, which may have eluded earlier screens
for such domains. Additionally, other forms of contextual
information emerging from newer studies involving largescale mutational analysis of eukaryotic genes, highthroughput analysis of gene expression, sub-cellular protein localization and protein-protein interactions could
also provide clues regarding the functions of uncharacterized proteins.
In particular, we are interested in using computational
methods to identify novel eukaryote-specific proteins that
may be involved in RNA metabolism and predicting their
potential biochemical functions. In the current work we
use a combination of sequence analysis, homology-based
fold prediction and contextual information to describe
two novel conserved RNA-protein or protein-protein
interaction modules and one catalytic module that are
found in proteins predicted to participate in regulation of
the cell cycle and decapping. We discuss these findings in
the context of the origin of the decapping apparatus in
eukaryotes and present hypotheses for the possible functions of poorly characterized but highly conserved groups
of eukaryotic proteins.

Results and discussion
Identification of the novel FDF domain and conserved
eukaryotic proteins with domains related to the RNAbinding domain SM domain
Several RNA binding proteins in eukaryotes are characterized by the presence of highly charged or polar low-complexity segments, typically containing repeats of simple
motifs such as SR, RG and GGY [16-18]. Experimental evidence has suggested that these segments interact with
RNA with low target specificity or aid in their localization
to specific RNA processing substructures [16-19]. These
segments are usually combined with globular domains
that may mediate more specific interactions with RNA.
Hence, detection of proteins containing these segments
provides a means of identifying potential RNA-binding

proteins that may either lack previously characterized
RBDs or contain very divergent versions of them. Accordingly, we generated a sieve for such proteins using pattern
searches that identified proteins with multiple occurrences of the low-entropy repeat motifs that are typical of
RNA-binding proteins. Those proteins in this set, which
were identified as potential RNA-binding proteins or
RNA-processing enzymes in our previous surveys
[1,20,21] conducted using sensitive profiles for RBDs and
associated enzymes, were removed in the first step. Of the
proteins that remained, we selected those proteins that
contained potential globular domains when screened
using the SEG program [22]. These proteins were then further searched using the PFAM domain collection [23] to
identify any previously reported modules that may have
escaped our searches.
Via this procedure we identified one group of experimentally uncharacterized proteins typified by Saccharomyces
cerevisiae Scd6p and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Sum2p as
potential RNA-binding proteins. These proteins formed a
distinctive family (hereinafter Scd6p family), which
included the mRNA binding protein Rap55 from the newt
Pleurodeles waltl and orthologous representatives from
fungi, animals, plants and apicomplexans (Cryptosporidium and Plasmodium). This observation suggests that the
family is likely to have emerged prior to the diversification
of the crown group eukaryotes and possibly performs a
well-conserved function. Analysis with the SEG program
[22] suggested that these proteins contain distinct N- and
C-terminal globular domains flanked by low complexity
regions enriched in charged residues, including the RS and
RG motifs. In order to understand better the affinities of
these globular domains we initiated PSI-BLAST searches
(profile inclusion threshold = .01; iterated to convergence) of the Non-Redundant database (NR) with them
using representatives from several different organisms.
Interestingly, in searches with the N-terminal module, Sm
RNA-binding domains were recovered, either with significant hits (e = 10-4–10-6) or as the best hits with borderline E-values. As these domains had not been reported by
others or us in systematic surveys for Sm proteins [1,24],
we investigated them in greater detail using new positionspecific score matrices, which were made by including all
the previously identified representatives of Sm domains in
the nr database. A search of the NR database with this profile recovered members of the Scd6p in iteration 7 with
significant e-values (e = 10-4–10-6 at the point of first
recovery). Secondary structure prediction using a multiple
alignment of the of the N-terminal globular domain of the
Scd6p family showed that it possessed an all β-fold with a
perfect correspondence to the secondary structure elements observed in the Sm-type SH3 β-barrel fold [25,26]
(also see SCOP Database [27]). Barring the Sm domains,
neither other members of the SH3-like folds nor any other

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/45

distinct β-barrel-folds, such as the OB fold, were recovered
in these searches. Likewise, the Scd6p-like proteins were
not detected in searches with profiles for various OB fold
domains and other β-strand rich RNA-binding domains.
These observations strongly suggested that the Scd6p family contained a previously unreported, divergent form of
the Sm domain.
A multiple alignment of the classical Sm domain was generated using a structural superposition of all crystallized
Sm domains proteins from the PDB database, including
the divergent bacterial version Hfq, as a template (Fig. 1).
A comparison of the multiple alignment of the Scd6p
family with this alignment of Sm domains shows that it
contains the hall mark features of the latter class, such as
the presence of a hxG signature (where h is a hydrophobic
residue) in the N-terminal half and a +Gpph signature
(where 'p' is a polar residue and '+' a positively charged
residue), which is seen in the C-terminal half of the
archaeo-eukaryotic versions (Fig. 1). Additionally the
Scd6p family contains certain unique features that set it
apart from other Sm domains: 1) It contains a conserved
C-terminal extension that is likely to form an additional
terminal strand that is usually lacking in many of the classical Sm domains (Fig. 1). 2) It contains a characteristic
motif, usually of the form GTEx+ (where + is a positively
charged residue; x is any residue) in the variable region
separating the conserved N- and C-terminal halves of the
Sm domain (Fig. 1). Most Sm domains contain a helix of
variable length at their N-terminus [28]. The Scd6p family
shows relatively poor sequence conservation and weak
helix prediction in the corresponding N-terminal regions.
However, the presence of the conservation in the Scd6p
family of the capping residue (either glycine or a small residue), which is present in the C-terminus of this helix, suggests that it might contain an abbreviated version of this
helix (Fig. 1).
The Sm proteins from archaea and eukaryotes and the
bacterial Hfq proteins do not bind RNAs stably as monomers, but only as heptameric or hexameric toroids
[25,28]. Furthermore, even the highly divergent versions
of the Sm superfamily, such as the MscS protein of the
bacterial mechano-sensory channels [29], form heptameric toroids similar to the RNA binding Sm domains,
suggesting that this quaternary structure may be pervasive
throughout this superfamily. Accordingly, we speculate
that the Scd6p proteins are also likely to be incorporated
into such structures. When the conservation pattern of the
Scd6p proteins is compared to the RNA contacts of the Sm
domains in the crystal structure of the Archaeoglobus fulgidus Sm1 (AF0875) heptameric ring, several similarities
and a few notable differences are seen [25] (Fig. 1). In the
highly conserved C-terminal +Gpph motif, the side chain
of the positively charged residue (R63 in Af Sm1/AF0875)

Figure alignment of the Scd6p family with representatives of other Sm domains
Multiple1
Multiple alignment of the Scd6p family with representatives of other Sm domains. Multiple sequence alignment of
the Sm domain of the Scd6p family was constructed using T-Coffee after parsing high-scoring pairs from PSI-BLAST search
results. The secondary structure from the crystal structures is shown above the alignment with E representing a strand. The
90% consensus shown below the alignment was derived using the following amino acid classes: hydrophobic (h: ALICVMYFW,
yellow shading) and its aliphatic subset (l: ALIV, yellow shading); small (s: ACDGNPSTV, green); and polar (p: CDEHKNQRST,
blue). The limits of the domains are indicated by the residue positions, on each end of the sequence. A '*' denotes the end of
the protein sequence. The numbers within the alignment are non-conserved inserts that have not been shown. The conserved
GTEx+ motif of the scd6p family is shaded red. The residues involved in RNA binding are denoted by '#'s on the top of the aligment. The conserved C-terminal extension of the Scd6p family is shown in a box. The sequences are denoted by their gene
name followed by the species abbreviation and GenBank Identifier (gi). The species abbreviations are: Af – Archaeoglobus fulgidus; Ec – Escherichia coli; Sau – Staphylococcus aureus; Afum – Aspergillus fumigatus; At – Arabidopsis thaliana; Cbr – Caenorhabditis
briggsae; Ce – Caenorhabditis elegans; Dm – Drosophila melanogaster; Hs – Homo sapiens; Nc – Neurospora crassa; Pf-Plasmodium
falciparum; Pwal – Pleurodeles waltl; Sc – Saccharomyces cerevisiae; and Sp – Schizosaccharomyces pombe.

packs against the uracil in the RNA, while backbones of
the subsequent residues make hydrogen bonds with the
base as well as the backbone of the RNA [25]. The conservation of this positively charged residue in the Scd6p family suggests that it may interact with the bases in RNA
similar to the canonical archaeal and eukaryotic Sm
domains [30] (Fig. 1). In the N-terminal half, the canonical Sm domains contain a conserved asparagine that
makes a hydrogen bonding interaction with the uracil in
the target RNA. This asparagine is typically replaced by a
highly conserved threonine in the Scd6p family [25].

While the hydroxyl group of this residue might form a
hydrogen bond with the base, it is unclear if it could confer the uracil-specificity that is provided by the asparagine
in the canonical Sm domains. The Scd6p family has a
polar residue instead of the aromatic residue that stacks
against the base in most other canonical Sm domains
(H37 in Af Sm1/AF0875; Fig. 1). This polar residue is
likely to form hydrogen bonds with base rather than the
stacking interactions which are observed in most other Sm
domains [25]. These differences, along with the Scd6p
family-specific GTEx+ motif that occurs between the N-

Figure architectures of Scd6p and FDF domain proteins
Domain 2
Domain architectures of Scd6p and FDF domain proteins. The domain architectures of the proteins containing the
Scd6p, FDF and Yjef-N domains are shown. The representative protein name, organism and the phyletic pattern are given

and C-terminal conserved regions of the domain, are
likely to confer certain unique nucleic-acid-binding properties on the Scd6 family [30].
Most members of the Scd6p family contain a single Smrelated N-terminal domain fused to another conserved Cterminal domain, except At4g19330 from Arabidopsis,
which is comprised of just two tandem repeats of the Sm
domain (Fig. 2). In order to investigate the distinct C-terminal domain of the Scd6p family we initiated PSI-BLAST
searches with this domain. In addition to members of the
Scd6p family, these searches also recovered other proteins
with significant e-values such as the Dcp3p (Yel015wp)
protein from S. cerevisiae and its fungal relatives and
uncharacterized proteins such as FLJ21128 (gi:
19923613) from Homo sapiens and its relatives from various animal clades. For example, searches with C-terminal
domain of the human Scd6p ortholog (gi: 13559033)
recovered Yel015wp/Dcp3 in iteration 5 with e = .003 and
FLJ21128; e = 4*10-4. Reciprocal searches with this region
from the above-mentioned proteins, such as Dcp3p and
FLJ21128 recovered bona fide members of the Scd6p family with significant e-values (e.g. the region from
FLJ21128 recovered the Rap55 in iteration 3; e = 2*10-4).
Unlike the Scd6p family, this conserved region occurred
in the N-terminal region of the Dcp3p and FLJ21128 proteins. These latter proteins additionally contained a C-terminal globular domain, which belongs of a specialized
family of Rossmann fold domains. This family of Rossman fold domains also includes the N-terminal domain
of the E. coli YjeF protein and, hereinafter we refer to this
domain as the YjeF-N type Rossmann fold domains (see
below for further discussion).
The above observations indicated that the conserved
region shared by the Scd6p family, Yel015wp/Dcp3p and
FLJ21128 is likely to define a novel domain. We named it
the FDF domain after the characteristic signature that is

present at N-termini of these domains (Fig. 3). The multiple alignment of the FDF domain shows that it is enriched
in polar and charged residues with few hydrophobic residues embedded in their midst. It is predicted to adopt an
entirely α-helical structure with multiple exposed
hydrophilic loops. These features suggest that the FDF
domain is likely to interact with RNA or highly charged
peptides that are commonly found in the ribonucleoprotein complexes. Though the animal FLJ21128-like proteins and the fungal Yel015wp/Dcp3p differ in their
architectures and are considerably divergent in terms of
sequence, the presence of a shared architectural core (FDF
domain fused to a YjeF-N-like Rossmann fold domain),
which is not found in any other eukaryotic proteins suggests that they might belong to the same orthologous lineage shared by animals and fungi (Fig. 2 and 3).
N-terminal to the FDF domain, the FLJ21128-like proteins from animals, but not the fungal Dcp3p-like proteins, contain an additional small conserved globular
domain. Based on its predicted secondary structure it is
likely to adopt an all β-fold. Further analysis of this globular domain using profiles for conserved domains showed
that it gave a significant hit (e-value=.005–001) with the
Sm domain profile. This observation, taken together with
its conservation pattern suggests that the extreme N-terminal domain in the FLJ21128-like proteins is yet another
uncharacterized, divergent version of the Sm fold (Fig. 1
and 2).
Potential functions for the FDF and Scd6p-like Sm domain
proteins in cell-cycle regulation and decapping
Genetic studies on S. cerevisiae Sdc6p and S. pombe Sum2p
have been fairly opaque with regards to their functions.
The Scd6p has been recovered as a suppressor of clathrin
deficiency [31]. However, there is no evidence that it
directly functions in the assembly of clathrin-coated vesicle. High-throughput localization studies have indicated

that it is localized to the cytoplasm and not the nucleus in
S. cerevisiae [32]. Sum2p was recovered as a weak suppressor of the over-production of the G2/M checkpoint regulator, Cdc25p [31]. The Cdc25p phosphatase is an
activator of the cyclin dependent kinase Cdk2p and when
over-produced it results in a bypass of the G2/M checkpoint, which ensures that DNA replication is completed
before the M phase is initiated. Specifically, expression of
the N-terminal Sm-like domain of Sum2p, but not the full
length Sum2p, was found to restore the G2/M checkpoint
bypass in Cdc25p-overproducing cells, as well as in cells
with mutations in Cdk2p and Wee1p, which show identical checkpoint defects [31]. Consistent with these observations, the abrogation of the expression of the C. elegans
ortholog of Sum2p, Y18D10A.17, results in cytokinesis
defects and loss of fertility [33,34]. In cluster-analysis of
gene expression patterns in C. elegans, Y18D10A.17
strongly groups with several genes that are over-expressed
in the germline, oocytes and during cell division [35]. The
newt homolog of Scd6p and Sum2p, Rap55 has been
shown to be localized to mRNA containing cytoplasmic
RNP particles [36]. It is present in a sharp temporal window in the oocytes, eggs and very early cleavage stages but
not in the later stages of embryonic development or the
adult tissues [36]. These observations point to a possible
general role for these proteins in the regulation of pathways associated with cell-cycle progression.
The previously characterized Sm domain proteins in yeast
have been shown to form at least three major hetero-heptameric complexes [35,37,38]. The first of these is a com-

plex formed by the classical Sm proteins B, D1, D2, D3, E,
F, and G and constitutes the core of the RNPs that bind the
U1, U2, U4 and U5 snRNAs. A second complex formed by
proteins Lsm2-8p is associated with the U6 snRNA and is
a component of the U4/U6 and U4/U6·U5 snRNPs. The
third complex, consisting of Lsm1-7p, is associated with
proteins like Dcp1p, Pat1p and Xrn1p, and is involved in
RNA degradation via the decapping pathway [35,39,40].
Another heptameric nuclear Sm complex probably identical to the classical Sm complex of the spliceosomal complex is associated with the telomerase RNA subunit and is
required for the telomerase function [41]. The conserved
cytoplasmic localization of the Scd6p family and the association of Rap55 with mRNA containing particles resembles that of the processing bodies that contain the Lsm17p complex. This strongly suggests that the Scd6p proteins
function in the cytoplasm, possibly as an alternative monomeric unit in formation of specialized Lsm1-7p-like heptameric complexes. These Scd6p-containing complexes
could potentially bind a distinct subset of mRNAs that are
specifically recognized by the Scd6p Sm-like domain.
These Scd6p-containing complexes could possibly either
target bound mRNAs for degradation or, conversely, stabilize the mRNAs by blocking their association with the
Lsm1-7p complex involved in decapping. Under such a
scenario, the specific regulation of the stabilities of various mRNAs encoding proteins involved in cytokinesis,
cell cycle check points or clathrin coated vesicle assembly
could account for the defects observed in these pathways.
Interestingly, in line with this proposal, a second stronger
suppressor of the checkpoint bypass caused by the over-

production of Cdc25p in S. pombe is the Sum3 gene,
which encodes a RNA helicase [31]. Hence, it is possible
that Sum2p and Sum3p act together to regulate the stability and translation of a similar set of mRNAs encoding
check point proteins.
The available evidence also implicates the Dcp3p and
FLJ21128 proteins with FDF and YjeF-N-type Rossmann
fold domains in the decapping process. High-throughput
analyses of protein-protein interactions in yeast using
affinity precipitation and two-hybrid systems have consistently recovered the decapping enzymes Dcp1 and
Dcp2, Dhh1p, the superfamily II helicase involved in
decapping process, and the ribosomal protein S28 as
potential interaction partners of Dcp3p [42-44]. The subcellular localization pattern of Dcp3p based on GFP tag
analysis indicates that it is entirely cytoplasmic like Scd6p,
Dhh1p. Specifically, it translocates to punctate foci [32],
just like the decapping enzymes Dcp1p and Dcp2p and
the Lsm1-7p complex [40,45]. These observations suggest
that the Dcp3p and FLJ21128 proteins are likely to be
associated with other proteins of the mRNA decapping
complex in the specialized cytoplasmic processing bodies
[45]. The presence of the N-terminal Sm domain in the
FLJ21128 (and it orthologs from other animals) suggests
that it might directly interact with other Sm proteins to be
incorporated in specialized Sm heptamers.
Further clues regarding the functions of the Dcp3p and
FLJ21128 are furnished by an analysis of the C-terminal
YjeF-N-type Rossmann fold domain. Both iterative
sequence searches with the PSI-BLAST program and structural similarity searches of PDB show that the dehydrogenase-type Rossmann domains are their closest relatives.
For example a PSI-BLAST search with the YjeF-N domain
of Dcp3p recovers dehydrogenases with significant e-values (e = 10-5; iteration 6), while Ynl200cp (PDB:1jzt), a
member of this family, recovers oxidoreductases like Dglycerate dehydrogenase with significant Z-scores (Z =
8.9) in structural similarity searches with the DALI program. However, a comparison of the sequence conservation pattern of the YjeF-N domains with that of the
conventional Rossmann-fold dehydrogenases reveals several notable differences (Fig. 4 and Additional file 1).
These include: 1) All members of this family contain two
additional consecutive N-terminal helices that precede the
first strand of the α/β core of the Rossmann fold and the
core itself contains eight α/β units. Both these helices contain nearly absolutely conserved acidic residues. 2) The α/
β core contains two characteristic aspartates; an absolutely
conserved D at the end of strand 5 and one nearly universal D at end of strand 4. 3) The first helix of the α/β core
of the Rossmann fold is extended by a whole turn resulting in the abbreviation of the glycine-rich nucleotide
binding loop of the fold (Fig. 4). 4) The central sheet of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/45

the Rossmann fold is highly curved to form a peculiar barrel-like structure and the second additional N-terminal
helix and the first helix of the α/β core pack against each
other (Fig. 4). This structural quirk is chiefly stabilized by
two sets of highly conserved interactions. Firstly, the saltbridge and hydrogen-bonding interaction between the
conserved acidic residue in the second N-terminal additional helix and the RH doublet in the first helix of the α/
β core helps to positioning these two helices against one
side of the curved sheet. Secondly, the hydrogen bonding
between the conserved asparate at the end of strand 4 and
the nearly absolutely conserved threonine C-terminal to
strand 5 help in stabilizing the curvature of the central
sheet (Fig. 4). 5) The acidic residue in the N-terminalmost additional helix of the YjeF-N, the acidic residue at
the end of strand 5 and the polar residue (usually asparagine) from loop between strand 1 and helix 1 of the α/β
core, line the mouth of the barrel- like structure to constitute the potential active site of this domain (Fig. 4).
In bacteria the YjeF-N domain is often found fused to a Cterminal kinase domain of the ribokinase superfamily
(Fig. 2). Given that kinase domains are often fused to different phosphoesterase (phosphatase) domains [46], it is
possible that the YjeF-N-type Rossmann fold domains
may also catalyze this reaction. The conservation of the
acidic residues in the predicted active site of the YjeF-N
domains is reminiscent of the presence of such residues in
the active sites of diverse hydrolases. Thus, in the context
of the decapping pathway, it is possible that the YjeF-N
domains of Dcp3p and FLJ21128 catalyze hydrolytic
RNA-processing reactions, such as, phosphoester hydrolysis, dephosphorylation, demethylation or glycosyl bond
hydrolysis.
The crystal structures of the archaeal Sm protein, SmAP3,
and MscS provide examples of Sm domain toroids with
additional N-terminal and/or C-terminal domains
[29,47]. These structures indicate that these extension
project out on either side of the of the central heptameric
toroid formed by Sm domains [29,47]. If the Scd6p were
to form similar toroidal structures, then the N- and C-terminal charged extensions with RG motifs and the FDF
domains of the proteins are likely to project out similarly.
In the canonical Sm toroids the RNA is threaded through
the central cavity of this toroid, and previous studies have
suggested that the charged extensions projecting away
from the Sm core may form additional non-specific contacts with the RNA [25,26,48]. A similar RNA-binding
function can be envisaged for the FDF domain. However,
it is also possible that it forms a distinct interaction surface to bind charged peptides from proteins belonging to
a specific RNP complex, possibly the complex that is
involved in decapping [45].

which are specific to this system. The most prominent of
these inventions are the FDF domain and PATADs (for
PAT1 alpha helical domains), the conserved α-helical
domains seen in yeast Pat1p and its relatives from other
eukaryotes. Sequence analysis and structure prediction
also suggests that the decapping proteins, Edc1p/Edc2p
[53], are also potential examples of poorly structured proteins that appear to be de novo innovations of the eukaryotes. In other instances, distinctive variants of preexisting
globular folds appear to have been recruited for novel
functions. An example of this is the decapping enzyme
subunit Dcp1p, which contains a divergent variant of the
peptide-binding EVH1 domain [54] that appears to have
been recruited for a different, possibly catalytic function
in the decapping process.

and its conserved features

A Cartoon representation of the YjeF-N type Rossmann fold and its conserved features. The cartoon representation of the YjeF-N-type Rossmann fold domain was
constructed using the crystal structure of the yeast YjeF-N
domain containing protein (PDB: 1JZT). The N terminal helices are named N1 and N2, and the core helices and strands
are named H1 to H7 and S1 to S8 respectively. The conserved residues of this fold corresponding to D16, E33, N69,
N70, R79, H80, D138, D173 and T176 in this fold are shown
in ball and stick representation. The salt bridges (E33 and
R79 and H80) and hydrogen bonds (D138 and T176)
between these conserved residues that are critical for the
stabilization of the fold are shown as magenta dotted lines.
The region between the strand 1 and helix 1 of the α/β core
that corresponds to the glycine-rich nucleotide binding loop
in the classic Rossmann fold (residues 66 and 72) is shown in
red. Note the curvature of the central sheet and the packing
of helix 1 of the α/β core and the second N-terminal additional helix.

Scd6p and Dcp3p in the context of the origin and
evolution of the decapping machinery
The provenance of the decapping-dependent RNA degradation system in eukaryotes appears to have involved a
number of different innovations and recruitment events.
One process involved the de novo "invention" of new αhelical domains that mediate particular interactions,

The MutT domain of Dcp2p [55] and the YjeF-N domain
of Dcp3p appear to represent cases where the ancestral
active site residues of the pre-existing catalytic domains
appear to have been maintained, but they acquired a new
set of substrates, specific to the decapping process. Analysis of phyletic patterns shows that Dcp2p is conserved
throughout currently-sampled eukaryotes suggesting that
it was present in the common ancestor of the extant
eukaryotes. The closest relatives of this MutT domain are
seen in bacteria, suggesting that the precursor of the
Dcp2p catalytic domain may have been acquired very
early in eukaryotic evolution via a transfer from a bacterial
lineage. The precursor of Dcp3p and FLJ21128 was probably present at least since the common ancestor of the
fungi and animals. Analysis of phyletic patterns of YjeF-N
domains indicates that a second version of this domain,
which is not fused to the FDF domain, is conserved across
the three principal superkingdoms of life. Phylogenetic
analysis of this version supports the monophyly of the
YjeF-N domain in each of the three superkingdoms (barring certain lateral transfer involving bacteria; data not
shown), suggesting that a single copy of the YjeF-N
domain is traceable to the last universal common ancestor
of all life forms. Its fusion to a small-molecule kinase of
the ribokinase superfamily in bacteria suggests that the
ancestral form of the YjeF-N domain may have functioned
in the metabolism of a critical low molecular weight compound. The version of the YjeF-N domain found in Dcp3
and FLJ21128 was probably derived in the common
ancestor of the animals and the fungi through duplication
of the more ancient version of the YjeF-N domain. Alternatively, it could have been acquired via lateral transfer
from a bacterial lineage. The extensive sequence divergence of the two versions currently prevents us from distinguishing between these possibilities through
phylogenetic analysis.
The Sm domain is an ancient RNA binding domain that
appears to have bound RNA ligands even in the last uni-

BMC Genomics 2004, 5:45

versal common ancestor of all extant life forms
[1,24,37,49]. In bacteria, at least two ancient versions are
present, namely Hfq [50,51] and the YhbC [52] (an
uncharacterized protein found in most bacteria in the
same operon with genes for the translation elongation factor NusA and initiation factor IF2; VA and LA, unpublished observations). Both these versions of the Sm
domain are predicted to participate in binding RNAs in
the context of translation. In archaea too the Sm domains
interact with various RNA ligands, such as the RNAse P
ribozyme [49].
The Sm superfamily of domains appears to have been vertically inherited by the eukaryotes from the common
ancestor of the archaeo-eukaryotic lineage [1,37,49]. In
eukaryotes the superfamily underwent a proliferation and
appears to have been recruited as the core protein component of various eukaryote-specific RNP complexes such as
the spliceosomal particles, the decapping complex and
the telomerase complex. Phyletic patterns suggest that
their explosive diversification in eukaryotes, giving rise to
highly divergent forms such as the Scd6p family, appears
to have happened prior to the divergence of the extant
eukaryotic lineages. This suggests that the diversification
of Sm-domain superfamily might have enabled them to
interact with a diverse range of RNA ligands and protein
partners and there by favored the emergence of multiple
eukaryote-specific RNP complexes. Subsequently each of
these complexes may have developed further, through the
process of innovation of new α-helical domains and
recruitment of catalytic domains from various sources.

Conclusions
We show that the Scd6p family contains a novel divergent
version of the RNA-binding Sm domain and a previously
uncharacterized C-terminal domain, the FDF domain.
While the Scd6p Sm domain is predicted to bind RNA like
most other prokaryotic and eukaryotic Sm domains, it is
likely to have certain unique characteristics in terms of target specificity. The FDF domain is also present in several
proteins such as Dcp3p and FLJ21128, where it is combined with the YjeF-N domain, a novel version of the
Rossmann fold domain, and in some cases with another
divergent version of the Sm domain. Along with other
atypical Sm domains, like Ataxin-2 [24], Scd6 might form
alternative Sm complexes, distinct from the, classical Sm,
Lsm1-7p and Lsm2-8p complexes. A variety of contextual
connections from expression, protein-protein interaction
and intracellular localization data, suggest that the Scd6p,
Dcp3p and FLJ21128 are associated with mRNAs in the
cytoplasmic substructures and possibly regulate the stability of specific messages via the decapping system. The FDF
domain may mediate interactions that are specific to these
RNP complexes. Phyletic analysis of other components of
the decapping system suggests that they have diverse ori-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/5/45

gins and the explosive diversification of the Sm domains
at the base of the eukaryotic radiation may have played an
important role in the provenance of the uniquely eukaryotic RNP complexes.

Methods
The non-redundant (NR) database of protein sequences
(National Center for Biotechnology Information, NIH,
Bethesda) was searched using the BLASTP program [56].
Iterative database searches were conducted using the PSIBLAST program with either a single sequence or an alignment used as the query, with the PSSM inclusion expectation (E) value threshold of 0.01 (unless specified
otherwise); the searches were iterated until convergence
[56,57]. For all searches with compositionally biased proteins, the statistical correction for this bias was employed.
Multiple alignments were constructed using the T_Coffee
[58] or PCMA [59] programs, followed by manual correction based on the PSI-BLAST results. Globular domains
were predicted using the SEG program with the following
parameters: window size 40, trigger complexity = 3.4;
extension complexity = 3.75 [22]. All large-scale sequence
analysis procedures were carried out using the SEALS
package [60]. Specifically, pattern searches were carried
out using the GREF program from this package. Structural
similarity searches were conducted using the DALI program. The Swiss-PDB viewer [61] and Pymol programs
were used to carry out manipulations of PDB files. Figures
were rendered using PyMOL [62,63] or POV-Ray [64].
Protein secondary structure was predicted using a multiple alignment as the input for the PHD program [65,66].
Similarity-based clustering of proteins was carried out
using the BLASTCLUST program [67].
Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the maximum-likelihood methods. Maximum-likelihood distance
matrices were constructed with the TreePuzzle 5 program
[68] using 1000 replicates generated from the input alignment and used as the input for construction of neighborjoining trees with the Weighbor program [69]. Weighbor
uses a weighted NJ tree construction procedure that has
been shown to effectively correct for long-branch effects
[69]. Alternatively a full ML tree was constructed using the
Proml program of the Phylip package [70]. This tree was
used as the input tree to generate further full ML trees
using the PhyML program [71] with 100 bootstrap replicates generated from the input alignment. The consensus
of these trees was derived using the Consense program of
the Phylip package to obtain the bootstrapped ML tree.
Gene neighborhoods were determined by searching the
NCBI PTT tables with a custom-written script. These tables
can be accessed from the genomes division of the Entrez
retrieval system [72].
