Abstract
Background: The genome of Protochlamydia amoebophila UWE25, a Parachlamydia-related endosymbiont of freeliving amoebae, was recently published, providing the opportunity to search for genomic islands (GIs).
Results: On the residual cumulative G+C content curve, a G+C-rich 19-kb region was observed. This sequence
is part of a 100-kb chromosome region, containing 100 highly co-oriented ORFs, flanked by two 17-bp direct
repeats. Two identical gly-tRNA genes in tandem are present at the proximal end of this genetic element. Several
mobility genes encoding transposases and bacteriophage-related proteins are located within this chromosome
region. Thus, this region largely fulfills the criteria of GIs. The G+C content analysis shows that several modules
compose this GI. Surprisingly, one of them encodes all genes essential for F-like conjugative DNA transfer (traF,
traG, traH, traN, traU, traW, and trbC), involved in sex pilus retraction and mating pair stabilization, strongly
suggesting that, similarly to the other F-like operons, the parachlamydial tra unit is devoted to DNA transfer. A
close relatedness of this tra unit to F-like tra operons involved in conjugative transfer is confirmed by phylogenetic
analyses performed on concatenated genes and gene order conservation. These analyses and that of gly-tRNA
distribution in 140 GIs suggest a proteobacterial origin of the parachlamydial tra unit.
Conclusions: A GI of the UWE25 chromosome encodes a potentially functional F-like DNA conjugative system.
This is the first hint of a putative conjugative system in chlamydiae. Conjugation most probably occurs within freeliving amoebae, that may contain hundreds of Parachlamydia bacteria tightly packed in vacuoles. Such a conjugative
system might be involved in DNA transfer between internalized bacteria. Since this system is absent from the
sequenced genomes of Chlamydiaceae, we hypothesize that it was acquired after the divergence between
Parachlamydiaceae and Chlamydiaceae, when the Parachlamydia-related symbiont was an intracellular bacteria. It
suggests that this heterologous DNA was acquired from a phylogenetically-distant bacteria sharing an amoebal
vacuole. Since Parachlamydiaceae are emerging agents of pneumonia, this GI might be involved in pathogenicity. In
future, conjugative systems might be developed as genetic tools for Chlamydiales.

Background
First described in 1997, Parachlamydia acanthamoebae is an
obligate intracellular bacterium naturally infecting freeliving amoebae [1,2]. It was isolated from Acanthamoeba
spp. recovered from the nasal mucosa of healthy volunteers [1]. Later, additional strains of Parachlamydiaceae
have been found within about 5% of Acanthamoeba spp.
and once within Hartmanella vermiformis [2,3]. The 16S
rRNA sequences of these Parachlamydiaceae are about 14%
different from those of both genera Chlamydophila and
Chlamydia [2,3]. Since the 16S rRNA sequence difference
between Chlamydophila sp. and Chlamydia sp. is 6% only,
it clearly appears that the speciation between the two latter occurred after the divergence between Parachlamydiaceae and Chlamydiaceae.
Like other Chlamydiales, Parachlamydiaceae can present
two developmental stages: the reticulate body, a metabolically active dividing form, and the elementary body, an
infective stage; the crescent body is another infective form,
not observed in Chlamydiaceae [4]. Differentiation of the
infective stages in reticulate bodies and multiplication of
the latter were recently shown to occur within amoebal
vacuoles, that may contain hundreds of bacteria [4].
Depending on the symbiotic/pathogenic relationships
prevailing between both organisms, the escape of the bacteria from the amoeba may occur either by the release of
secreted vesicles or by the lysis of the host [4].
There is a growing evidence of the human pathogenicity
of Parachlamydiaceae [2]. For instance, positive Parachlamydia serologies were shown to be associated with a
febrile epidemic [5], community-acquired pneumonia
[6], and inhalation pneumonia [7]. The role of Parachlamydia-related bacteria as agents of inhalation pneumonia is further suggested by the temperature-dependent
release of the bacteria from their amoebal reservoir [8].
PCR amplification of parachlamydial DNA from monocytes, sputa and bronchoalveolar lavages collected from
patients suffering of bronchitis or pneumonia also supports the pathogenic potential of Parachlamydia [9-12].
The survival of these Chlamydia-like organisms within
human macrophages [13] is an additional hint of parachlamydial pathogenicity.
Horn et al. [14], by sequencing and annotating the whole
genome of the Parachlamydia-related UWE25 contributed
much to the understanding of the evolution of chlamydiae. Indeed, they demonstrated that major virulence
mechanisms of Chlamydiaceae such as the Type Three
Secretion System (TTSS) and the Chlamydial Protease-like
Activity Factor (CPAF) are also encoded by the chromosome of the evolutionary early-branching Parachlamydiaceae UWE25. Genome analysis of the parachlamydial
endosymbiont also identified Open Reading Frames

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/48

(ORFs) homologous to Type Four Secretion Systems
(TFSS) and characterized by a high G+C content, suggesting that they result from an horizontal transfer. Based on
their annotation revealing the apparent absence of genes
necessary for DNA transfer, Horn et al. [14] proposed that
this TFSS was involved in protein export but not in DNA
transfer.
To date, numerous genomic islands (GIs) were already
identified along whole chromosomal sequences of various bacterial species. For instance, 140 GIs are described
in the Islander database, including GIs of proteobacteria,
firmicutes, actinobacteria and cyanobacteria [15]. Thus,
we wondered whether any GIs were located along the bacterial chromosome of the amoebal endosymbiont
UWE25.
GIs are genetic elements which length vary from 10 to 200
kb and are inserted in a chromosome after a lateral transfer occurring, in some instances, between phylogenetically-distant microorganisms. Their heterologous origins
are generally evidenced by a G+C content different from
that of the remaining bacterial chromosome and by the
presence of various mobility genes (i.e. involved in transposition, transduction or conjugative transfer), that are
occasionally source of GI instability [16,17]. They are
often flanked by particular DNA sequences, such as direct
repeats or insertion sequences. Moreover, tRNA loci are
generally used as insertion sites by GIs for their chromosomal integration [16-18]. Since no genetic tools are available for the study of this obligate intracellular bacteria, a
bioinformatic approach was chosen to locate putative GIs.

Results
A genomic island is present in the genome of UWE25
Using standard G+C content analyses of Parachlamydiarelated UWE25 chromosome, we observed a G+C-rich
region (Figure 1A and 1B), similar to that shown by Horn
et al. [14]. Using the residual cumulative G+C content
analysis adapted from the GC profile of Zhang and Zhang
[19], we were able to precisely define a 19-kb region (Figure 1C). The presence of 17-bp direct repeats flanking a
100-kb chromosome region (1648 to 1748 kb, Table 1)
that encompasses the 19-kb DNA sequence enabled us to
define a new region composed of 100 ORFs (See additional data file 1 for the description of these genes and
their location on the chromosome of UWE25). Interestingly, this 100-kb region is characterized by a higher level
of local gene coorientation (75/100) than that characterizing the remaining of the genome (1015/1931, 52.6%, p
< 0.001) and by a particular signature in the cumulative
GC skew analysis. Two identical gly-tRNA genes in tandem
are located at the proximal end of this 100-kb genetic element (Figure 1A,1C and Table 1). Several mobility genes
(eight putative transposases, one recombinase and seven

white line disrupting the grey area. The region is characterized by a different slope in the cumulative GC skew analysis (black

strand, otherwise by an 'X' on the bottom line (For details, see Table in Supplementary Material 1). A large majority of genes

G+C content (40.0%) clearly higher than that of the whole genome (34.7%). The positions of transposases (open circles) and of
phage-related genes (full circles) are indicated.

bacteriophage related-proteins) are encoded within the
100-kb region (Figure 1C, Table 1). Thus, this region
largely fulfills the accepted criteria of GIs [16-18]. We
termed this newly described GI "Pam100G" (Protochlamydia amoebophila, 100-kb, Gly-tRNA) according to the
nomenclature used in the Islander database [15].
Mosaicism of the 100-kb genomic island
Interestingly, this GI can be divided into clearly distinct
regions, according to their G+C content (Figure 1B, Table
2). The residual cumulative G+C content analysis highlights a modular structure with different slopes, each linear segment indicates that genes of this unit present a
rather constant local G+C content (Figure 1C). A positive
or a negative slope would indicate that each block of
genes presents a G+C content higher or lower that of the
UWE25 chromosome, respectively.

The first module begins with a direct repeat and two identical gly-tRNAs in tandem. Composed of 28 ORFs, this
unit exhibits a G+C content (36.4%) similar to that of the
remaining of the genome of UWE25 (1931 ORFs, 36.1%).
Sixteen homologs to these 28 genes (57%) were found in

databases, 12 of them (75%) exhibiting a best score in
BLAST analyses with a Chlamydiaceae ORF (See additional
data file 1). Interestingly, no gene of the other modules of
the 100-kb GI exhibited a best hit in similarity analyses
with any Chlamydiaceae counterpart. Some of the genes
present in the first module, such as sctN and sctQ, are part
of a TTSS also present in Chlamydiaceae. The other TTSS
genes are disseminated along the chromosome of
UWE25. The presence of some TTSS genes in the first
module and of a gene encoding a putative transposase at
the distal end of the first module of this 100-kb GI suggests that this first unit was acquired by chromosomal
rearrangements. (See additional data file 1 for the results
of BLAST analyses).
Characterized by a low G+C content (34.1%), the 2nd
module encodes 18 ORFs. Only five are similar to known
protein sequences (28%), four of them being identified as
mobility genes (three bacteriophage-related genes and
one putative transposase encoding gene).

G+C content is similar to that of 36.1% of the remaining genome (calculated on 1931 ORFs);
of the 2031 ORFs of the genome of UWE25 have products homologous to plant proteins, but no ORFs of the GI were homologous to plant
counterparts;

d not only the best BLAST hit is taking into consideration to determine the putative function encoded by the ORF;
e one of them has an e-value above 0.001.
b 5%

The 3rd module (19 kb), exhibiting the second highest
G+C content of the UWE25 genome (40.9%), comprises
21 ORFs. Some of these genes were identified as tra genes
by Horn et al. [14]. Using BLAST analyses and alignment
tools, we re-annotated the whole module (see below)
and, if we except two transposase genes and one ORF of
unknown function, we unveiled that all ORFs of this
module belong to a genetic unit similar to the tra operons
encoding the TFSS previously described in proteobacterial
genomes (Figure 2, See additional data file 1 for the reannotations of this module).
Presenting a low G+C content (33.4%), the 4th module
(10 kb) is composed of 13 ORFs. All these ORFs were previously annotated by Horn et al. [14] as encoding hypothetical proteins or without homolog. Our BLAST analysis
identified one ORF homologous to genes encoding bacteriophage-related proteins and two genes of proteins
involved in DNA metabolism (Table 1 and 2, see also the
table in the additional data file 1). Interestingly, a direct

repeat is located between the 9th and 10th genes of the
module. This 17-bp direct repeat, that presents 3 mismatches is similar to those present at the proximal and
distal ends of the GI, exhibiting the same 14 conserved
nucleotides. It may reflect a complex evolutionary history
of the GI, possibly enabling it to be mobile as 25-kb, 75kb or 100-kb DNA segments.
A single large protein is encoded along the 5th module (6
kb). Its G+C content is one of the highest of the UWE25
chromosome (41.8%). By BLAST analysis, this protein
exhibits the strongest similarity with the human Nod3
protein.
The 6th module (12 kb) is characterized by a low G+C content (33.3%). This unit is composed of 13 ORFs, the first
ORF encoding a product similar to the Death on cure
(Doc) protein of P1 bacteriophage. Two ORFs code for
proteins involved in DNA metabolism and an additional
ORF encodes a putative transposase.

Comparison of the tra unit of the endosymbiont UWE25 with similar operons of pNL1 (Novosphingobium aromaticivorans), F

represents the genomic G+C content average. Only the ORFs composed of more than hundred amino-acids are presented on
genetic maps of tra units/operons by arrows according to their transcription direction (adapted from Lawley et al. [20]). Colors
or patterns are used to indicate tra gene homologs. White genes represent non-conserved transfer genes. Upper case letters
refer to the corresponding tra genes, whereas lower case letters f and c stand for trsF and trbC, respectively. Double slashes
indicate non-contiguous regions. Interestingly, the G+C-rich genes encoded by the UWE25 chromosome correspond to the
ORFs presenting tra homologs.

The 7th module is short (2 kb) and present a G+C-rich unit
(38.7%). Five of the six ORFs of this unit encode a probable resolvase, three putative transposases and a phagerelated Doc protein. The final direct repeat is located at the
end of this module. With the only exception of the phagerelated protein, all other ORFs of the 7th module appear to
be similar to gamma-proteobacterial proteins, possibly

explaining the observed different signal in the G+C content analysis.
Role of the type IV secretion system encoded by the 100kb genomic island
The functions of genes encoded by GIs may be related,
among others, to pathogenicity such as the ability to
exploit the host intracellular environment. Since no

genetic system has been described for any obligate intracellular chlamydiae, we investigated the putative functions
of this GI by bioinformatics. We focused our analyses on
the TFSS, for which a previous annotation of the tra genes
showed a genetic unit unable to transfer DNA [14]. Using
different protein comparison methods described in the
additional data file 1, we identified supplementary tra
genes, and compared the general organization of this tra
unit with other genetic elements encoding TFSS genes
[20]. The UWE25 tra unit displays a striking colinearity
with tra operons encoding F-like conjugative DNA
transfer system, especially to those of the F and pNL1 plasmids of Escherichia coli and Novosphingobium aromaticivorans, respectively (Figure 2). All homologous genes
essential for DNA transfer in plasmid F (traF, traG, traH,
traN, traU, traW, and trbC) and involved in sex pilus
retraction and mating pair stabilization [20] are present,
strongly suggesting that, similarly to the other F-like
TFSSs, the gene products encoded by the UWE25 tra unit
are devoted to DNA transfer. With the only exception of
traG, these genes are not present on P-like and I-like plasmids, reinforcing the close relationship prevailing
between the UWE25 tra unit and their F-like plasmids
counterparts.
Figure 3 shows that the UWE25 tra unit clusters within Flike TFSSs, confirming that it may function as a F-like conjugative system. Drawn as an UPGMA tree (Figure 3A), the
comparison of the genetic organization of all tra units was
performed as a gene order breakpoint analysis developed
for the study of the mitochondrial genome evolution [21].
This analysis clearly shows that the closest relatives of the
UWE25 tra units are the tra operons of the F-like conjugative plasmids. The Fitch-Margoliash- and the minimum
evolution comparisons performed on the same dataset
presented the same tree topologies, confirming the former
UPGMA results (data not shown). An omit test performed
on this tree confirms that the results are robust: with one
exception (involving the deep branching of one cluster on
one tree), all 11 trees were congruent in all their nodes.
Figure 3B shows an UPGMA tree comparing the Kimura
corrected p-distances (the proportion p of nucleotide sites
at which two sequences are different, taking into account
the proportion of transversion- and transition-substitution rates) of nucleotide sequences of the concatenated
traA, traK, traB, traV, and traC genes. A similar topology is
observed with (i) neighbor-joining- and minimum evolution trees inferred using the Kimura-corrected p-distances
and (ii) UPGMA, neighbor-joining- and minimum evolution trees performed on p-distance of the whole coding
sequences of the concatenated tra genes (See additional
data file 2 for these trees). Neighbor-joining- and minimum evolution methods comparing Kimura-corrected pdistances of the complete coding sequences confirmed
that the tra unit of UWE25 is phylogenetically closely

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/48

related to the tra operons of the F-like plasmids: the bootstrap values of 94% and 91% respectively, support the
node separating the concatenated tra genes of the chromosomal UWE25 and the R27 plasmid, a gamma-proteobacterial F-like conjugative plasmid, from those of all
other plasmids (See the additional data file 2 for these
trees). In neighbor-joining and minimum evolution analyses of p-distances, the tra unit of UWE25 also clusters
with the tra operons of gamma-proteobacterial F-like plasmids: the bootstrap of 96% and 92%, respectively, support the node separating the concatenated tra genes of
UWE25 and RTS1, SXT, R391, three gamma-proteobacterial F-like conjugative plasmid, from their closest relative,
R27 plasmid (See additional data file 2 for these trees).
Taken together, all these data strongly suggest that the
UWE25 tra unit is closely related to F-like conjugative tra
operons.
Origin of the genomic island and of its type four secretion
system
Our BLAST analyses [22] reveal that a majority (24/43) of
genes not presenting a best hit for chlamydial genes but
having homologs in other taxa are more related to proteobacterial genes (see Table 2 and the additional data file 1
for similarity analyses indicating for each parachlamydial
tra gene the most similar gene and its taxonomical background). Moreover, the BLAST analyses of the 21 ORFs of
the third module, encoding the tra genes, show that most
ORFs of this unit (15/21) are of proteobacterial origin.
However, since six of them present the highest similarity
to alpha-proteobacterial genes and six others to gammaproteobacterial genes, a more precise origin of the parachlamydial tra unit could not be precisely defined by this
first approach.

The presence of gly-tRNA at the proximal end of the GI of
UWE25 is consistent with a close relatedness between this
GI and proteobacteria: out of 14 GIs described in the
Islander database of Mantri et al. [15,22] inserted along a
chromosome by a gly-tRNA (14/140), 12 of them (86%)
were sequenced in a proteobacterial genome. No GI of
Gram-positives described in the Islander database are
inserted in a chromosome within a gly-tRNA gene. Again,
a precise proteobacterial origin could not be proposed,
because the distribution of gly-tRNA genes in alpha- (4/
22) and gamma-proteobacterial (8/72) GIs is not significantly different: by including only the non-redundant GIs,
the distribution of gly-tRNA genes in alpha and gammaproteobacterial GIs is 2/20 and 7/71, respectively.
Comparison of gene order between all tra units also failed
in assigning a precise origin to the UWE25 tra unit since it
branched near the alpha- and gamma-proteobacterial tra
operons (Figure 3A). The only first hint of a possible
gamma-proteobacterial origin for the UWE25 tra unit was

brought by the phylogenetic analyses (Figure 3B and additional files 1 &2). Thus, bootstraps values of 94, 91, 96
and 92% supported the node separating the concatenated
tra genes of UWE25 and several tra operons of gammaproteobacterial F-like plasmids from the F-plasmids of an
alpha-proteobacteria and of other gamma-proteobacteria.
(See above, and additional data file 2 for these trees).

Discussion
We showed that the Parachlamydia-related endosymbiont
UWE25 presents a 100-kb region largely fullfilling the
criteria of GIs [16-18]. Indeed, this DNA region characterized by a high level of gene co-orientation presents a G+C
content different from that of the remainder of the
genome. The presence of direct repeats flanking this chromosome region enabled us to focus on 100 ORFs. Two
identical gly-tRNA genes in tandem are present at the proximal end of this genetic element. Moreover, several mobility genes encoding transposases and bacteriophage
related-proteins are located within this chromosome
region.

The cumulative residual G+C content analysis shows that
this GI is composed of seven modules. Such a chimeric
organization was already described in other GIs [23,24].
The first module contains chlamydiae genes probably
brought by chromosome rearrangements. Some of these
genes, homologous to TTSS genes of Chlamydiaceae, might
provide selective advantages to strains that retained the
GI. The 2nd, 4th and 6th modules are mainly composed of
bacteriophage-related protein genes, that could reflect a
putative phage implication in GI formation.
The 3rd module codes for a TFSS similar to tra operons. We
propose that this tra unit is devoted to DNA transfer,
based (i) on similarity analyses demonstrating the presence of all genes encoding proteins used during a DNA
transfer, (ii) on phylogenetic analyses of tra unit genes
and, (iii) on comparison of gene order. These analyses
clearly demonstrate that the UWE25 tra unit is strongly
more related to F-like conjugative system than to P-like
and I-like secretion systems. The significant bootstraps of
all trees obtained by standard gene phylogeny and their
congruent topologies with others obtained by the gene

order breakpoint analysis not biased by codon usage
homing, strongly support the validity of these analyses
confirming the F-like conjugative nature of the parachlamydial tra unit. Thus, our model significantly differs
from the other proposed by Horn et al. [14], who did not
identify traA, traL, traK, traV, and concluded that the
UWE25 tra unit is involved in protein export, and not in
DNA transfer.
The 5th module presents a nucleotide composition similar
to the tra unit and is composed of a single high G+C 6-kb
gene, whose product is similar to the human Nod3 protein. The Nod (Nucleotide-binding oligomerization
domain) proteins are members of a family that also
includes the apoptosis regulator Apaf1 (Apoptotic protease activating factor 1) and plant disease-resistance gene
products [25]. The function of the human Nod3 is still
unknown. Like Nod1 and Nod2, Nod3 might be involved
in the recognition of conserved motifs present at the surface of bacteria, such as peptidoglycan.
The nucleotide G+C composition of the 2nd, 4th, and 6th
modules are similar, explaining the observed similar negative slope of the residual G+C curves. Moreover, these
three modules encode phage-related proteins and proteins involved in DNA metabolism. These modules probably involved in mobility might have a common origin,
the ancestral single phage module being currently separated in three pieces by the presence of the tra unit and of
the Nod3-like protein encoding gene.
The positive slope in the G+C analysis of the 7th module
echoes those of the tra unit (3rd module) and of the Nod3like protein (5th module). The 7th module encodes a transposition resolvase and three transposases similar to
gamma-proteobacterial homologs. With the only exception of the phage-related Doc protein, that has an
homolog at the beginning of the sixth module, and that
might be located there after transposition, the 7th module
appears thus to have a different origin than the 2nd, 4th
and 6th modules, though also encoding mobility genes.
The presence of a F-like tra unit along the sequences of
UWE25 is the first evidence of a putative conjugative system in chlamydiae. If conjugation occurs, it most probably takes place within free-living amoebae, that may
contain several hundreds of Parachlamydia bacteria tightly
packed in their vacuoles [4]. Such a conjugation system
would be a mechanism to transfer DNA between internalized bacteria sharing an amoebal vacuole. Moreover, it
may provide molecular genetic tools for obligate intracellular bacteria.
The presence of tra units/operons in the parachlamydial
UWE25 and in proteobacteria could be explained by an

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/48

emergence of this unit in a common ancestor of both
clades, and by its subsequent loss in Chlamydiaceae.
Another evolutionary scenario is that the tra unit was
acquired from a proteobacteria by a Parachlamydiaceae in
a common amoebal vacuole. Since the tra unit is absent
from all sequenced Chlamydiaceae genomes, this transfer
would have occurred after the divergence of Parachlamydiaceae and Chlamydiaceae, at a time when Parachlamydia
was already an intracellular bacteria. An intra-amoebal
transfer of this GI is supported by the permissivity of freeliving amoebae to proteobacteria [26], and by several
hints suggesting its proteobacterial origin. Though phylogenetic analyses suggested a gamma-proteobacterial origin of the F-like parachlamydial tra, further analyses have
to confirm whether this GI module was acquired from an
alpha-, beta-, or gamma-proteobacteria unit. We hypothesize that the F-like parachlamydial tra unit has been
brought by a lateral transfer from a proteobacterial
genome. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the
cumulative GC skew analysis [27-30] producing a signal
of the GI differing from that of the remaining of the
genome (Figure 1A and 1B). The value of nucleotide skew
analyses as good taxonomical markers is supported by (i)
routine analyses on prokaryotic genome by cumulative
TA-skews [30] and (ii) comparison of intragenic nucleotide skews of small subunit ribosomal RNA of the whole
living world [31]. The genometric approach appeared to
be able to identify GIs of Chlamydiales. Sequencing additional genomes of environmental chlamydiae, that
present a large biodiversity [3], will provide major insights
on bacterial evolution and hopefully a better comprehension of the emergence of this parachlamydial GI.

Conclusions
We showed that a GI present on the UWE25 chromosome
encodes a potentially functional F-like DNA conjugative
system. This is the first hint of a putative conjugative system in chlamydiae. Conjugation most probably occurs
within free-living amoebae, that may contain hundreds of
Parachlamydiaceae bacteria tightly packed in vacuoles.
Such a conjugative system might be involved in DNA
transfer between internalized bacteria. Since this system is
absent from the sequenced genomes of Chlamydiaceae, we
hypothesize that it was acquired after the divergence
between Parachlamydiaceae and Chlamydiaceae, when the
Parachlamydia-related symbiont was an intracellular bacteria. It suggests that this heterologous DNA was acquired
by a Parachlamydiaceae from phylogenetically-distant bacteria sharing an amoebal vacuole. Since Parachlamydiaceae
are emerging agents of pneumonia [2] and since many GIs
are also considered as pathogenicity islands [17], the
Pam100G GI might be involved in pathogenicity. In
future, conjugative systems might be developed as genetic
tools for studying Chlamydiales.

Methods
Sequence
The genome sequence of UWE25 [14] (Accession number:
NC_005861) is available at the NCBI website [32,33]. In
this contribution, the acronym UWE25 refers only to the
Parachlamydia-related endosymbiont UWE25, and thus
not to the Acanthamoeba sp. strain UWE25 from which the
parachlamydial endosymbiont UWE25 was recovered [3].
Horn et al. recently proposed UWE25 as the type strain of
a new bacterial species: Protochlamydia amoebophila [34].
BLAST analyses
BLAST analyses were performed with BLASTP 2.2.9 [35]
available on the NCBI website [36] using the BLOSUM62
matrix, and gap penalties of 11 and 1. Each ORF was compared against all genes of non-redundant databases available at the NCBI website. An e-value of 0.001 was selected
as a standard cut-off. To further identify possible homologous ORFs, we also BLASTed each tra gene of F plasmid
versus all genes of the full genome of Parachlamydia and
conversely, each ORF of the putative parachlamydial tra
unit versus counterparts of the different F-like plasmids.
CLUSTALW was used to detect the best relatedness of a
given parachlamydial Tra protein with its possible
homologs encoded by the F and pNL1 plasmids.
Residual cumulative GC content
The residual cumulative G+C content, a slightly modified
version of the cumulative GC profile defined by Zhang
and Zhang [19], was used to reveal local variations of G+C
content of a genome, without using sliding windows of
arbitrary size. First, a G+C content analysis was performed
on 100-bp windows of the selected chromosome
sequence, as for a cumulative GC skew analysis. The
cumulative G+C content GCn of the nth window is
obtained by cumulating the G+C contents from the first to
the nth window:
n

GCn = ∑ (Gi + Ci ) Ni
i =1

where, in the window i, Gi and Ci are the numbers of Gs
and Cs, respectively, and Ni is the total number of nucleotides. To visualize genomic regions differing from the
average G+C content, a linear regression y defined by a
slope k is performed on the cumulative curve using the
least square methods:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/48

GC'n = GCn - kn
Zhang and Zhang [19] recently demonstrated that, in
some instances, abrupt changes in the residual cumulative
G+C content curve correspond to genomic islands.
Repeats identification
The perfect tandem repeats identification was first performed using the EQUICKTANDEM software (Richard
Durbin, Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, CB10 1SA, UK) [37] on a 200kb DNA sequence (UWE25 genome position: 1.6 to 1.8
Mb) encompassing the tra genes previously identified by
Horn et al. [14]. The duplicated genes and the ORFs containing internal repeats were removed. For each pair of
direct repeats, potential unperfect matches of flanking
nucleotides were scanned using DNA strider 1.2.1 [38],
with the following settings: a minimal size of 11 bp and 3
mismatches. Furthermore, sequences similar to direct
repeats were searched along the whole chromosome, and
sequences also found outside the selected 200-kb region
were discarded from our analysis. Finally, the direct
repeats positions were compared to the G+C content
analysis, the cumulative GC skew curve, and to tRNA
genes locations.
Phylogenetic analyses
Since Horn et al. [14] did not identified traA, traL, traK,
traV, re-annotation of the UWE25 tra unit was necessary
for phylogenetic analyses. We used i) the genes of F-like
plasmids encoding the following tra genes, i.e. traA, traK,
traB, traV, traC, and ii) the corresponding ORFs of P- and
I-like plasmids [20], i.e. trbC/VirB2, trbG/VirB9, trbI/
VirB10, trbH/VirB7, trbE/VirB4 of P-plasmids and traX,
traN, traO, traI, traU of I-plasmids, respectively. The genes
were concatenated to obtain a single nucleotide sequence
and aligned with CLUSTALW ([39] as it was already
performed for genes of ribosomal proteins [40]. Using
this alignment and the MEGA 2.1 software [41], we
inferred phylogenetic relationships by drawing trees using
p-distances (the proportion p of nucleotide sites at which
two sequences compared are different) and Kimura corrected p-distance (correction for the rates of transition and
transversion) with Unweighted Pair Group Method with
Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA), neighbor-joining, and minimum evolution methods. To prevent alignment biases,
trees were drawn using the complete deletion option
implemented on MEGA 2.1.

y(n) = kn
where n is the position of the center of the nth window.
The residual cumulative G+C content curve GC' can then
be drawn as a function of the position of each window
center:

Gene order breakpoint analyses
To quantify the inversion and transposition events leading to the current organization of tra operons, the gene
order breakpoint analysis developed for small genomes
(mitochondria) by Blanchette et al. [21] was used to estimate the similarity of gene order existing between the tra

unit of UWE25 and the tra operons reviewed by Lawley et
al. [20]. The distance calculated for two given operons Oi
and Oj containing homologous genes proposed by Blanchette et al. [21] was slightly modified to take into account
the variation of gene numbers of tra operons: instead of
counting the number of minimal breakpoints existing
between two tra operons, a distance was estimated by
measuring the proportion of conserved gene pairs
between both genomic entities. Next, a comparison
matrix is established by calculating the distance for each
pairwise comparison. Finally, a dissimilarity matrix is
obtained by subtracting each distance from 1.

Supplementary figure. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the UWE25 tra
unit is phylogenetically closely related to F-like DNA conjugative tra operons: (A) UPGMA-, (B) Neighbor-joining-, and (C) minimum evolutiontrees comparing p-distances and Kimura corrected p-distances of nucleotide sequences of the concatenated traA, traK, traB, traV, and traC genes
(the UPGMA tree comparing the Kimura corrected p-distances of tra
genes, shown in Figure 3B, is presented here to facilitate comparison with
the other trees). Interestingly, in neighbor-joining and minimum evolution analyses of the p-distances, the tra unit of UWE25 is clustered with
tra operons of gamma-proteobacterial F-like plasmids: bootstrap values of
96% and 92%, respectively, support the node separating the concatenated
tra genes of UWE25 and RTS1, SXT, R391, three gamma-proteobacterial
F-like conjugative plasmids, from their closest relative R27 plasmid. Similarly, in neighbor-joining and minimum evolution analyses of the Kimura
corrected p-distances, bootstrap values of 94% and 91%, respectively,
support the node separating the concatenated tra genes of the chromosomal UWE25 and the R27 plasmid, another gamma-proteobacterial Flike conjugative plasmid, from those of all other plasmids.

For instance, if the operon Oi encodes sequentially four
genes (a, b, c, and d) and the operon Oj, six genes (a, b, e,
-d, -c, and -f; genes labeled by a minus sign are encoded by
the complementary strand), the gene order breakpoint
analysis reveals that two gene pairs are conserved: ab and
cd. The dissimilarity distances existing between the operons i) Oi and Oj, and ii) Oj and Oi would be: 1-(2/3) = 1/3
and 1-(2/5) = 3/5, respectively.
From the square dissimilarity matrix, phylogenetic trees
were drawn. Three different distance-matrix analyses were
used: the UPGMA, the Fitch-Margoliash- and the minimum evolution methods. To assess the robustness of the
tree, an omit test [42] was performed on 11 UPGMA trees,
in each one organism is missing.
