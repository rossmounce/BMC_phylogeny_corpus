The tendency to recreate ancestral CG
dinucleotides in the human genome
Mingkun Li1,2*, Su-Shing Chen1

Abstract
Background: The CG dinucleotides are known to be deficient in the human genome, due to a high mutation rate
from 5-methylated CG to TG and its complementary pair CA. Meanwhile, many cellular functions rely on these CG
dinucleotides, such as gene expression controlled by cytosine methylation status. Thus, CG dinucleotides that
provide essential functional substrates should be retained in genomes. How these two conflicting processes
regarding the fate of CG dinucleotides - i.e., high mutation rate destroying CG dinucleotides, vs. functional
processes that require their preservation remains an unsolved question.
Results: By analyzing the mutation and frequency spectrum of newly derived alleles in the human genome, a
tendency towards generating more CGs was observed, which was mainly contributed by an excess number of
mutations from CA/TG to CG. Simultaneously, we found a fixation preference for CGs derived from TG/CA rather
than CGs generated by other dinucleotides. These tendencies were observed both in intergenic and genic regions.
An analysis of Integrated Extended Haplotype Homozygosity provided no evidence of selection for newly derived
CGs.
Conclusions: Ancestral CG dinucleotides that were subsequently lost by mutation tend to be recreated in the
human genome, as indicated by a biased mutation and fixation pattern favoring new CGs that derived from
TG/CA.

Background
DNA methylation is central to important biological processes, including X chromosome inactivation[1], genetic
imprinting [2], gene-expression regulation [3-5], and the
defense mechanisms against parasitic DNA and transposons [6,7]. DNA methylation also plays an important
role in pathological processes such as cancer [8], is closely related with histone modification and RNAassociated silencing [9], and may be involved in genomic
instability [10].
DNA methylation in mammals is carried out by three
methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B)[11]
that target the cytosine in CG dinucleotides. A stochastic model for the maintenance of methylation during
DNA replication has been proposed that allows accurate
epigenetic inheritance[9,11]. However, CG dinucleotides

also experience a high mutation rate from cytosine to
thymine through the deamination of 5-methylcytosine
and a less-than-perfect repair mechanism for resulting
G/T mismatches [12-14], which calls into question the
stability of methylation of CG dinucleotides as an
important epigenetic marker.
In the human genome, the number of CG dinucleotides is ~25% of that expected given observed base
frequencies, which is due to a high mutation rate from
5-methylated CG to TG and its complementary pair CA
[15]. 15% of all CGs are clustered in so called “CpG
islands”, which are often located at the 5’ end of genes
and overlap with the promoter region, especially in
housekeeping genes [16]. Their methylation status is
highly associated with gene expression [3], but despite
this apparent functional constraint, loss of CpG islands
has been observed as a common event in mammalian
genomes [15,17,18].
Moreover, multiple pathways exist that preserve CG
dinucleotides in the genome, including a lack of methylation of CGs in CpG islands and a strong correction

bias towards C/G following T/G mismatches [14,19,20].
Two enzymes (TDG and MBD4) have been found to
selectively remove the thymine from a T:G mismatch in
the context of CpG dinucleotides [21,22].
In our previous study [23], we observed a strong fixation bias in favor of derived C/G alleles at CG-related
sites (dinucleotides that differ by one-step mutation
from CG: CT, CA, CC, AG, TG, GG) compared with C/
G alleles at CG-free sites (positions not preceded by C
or followed by G). TG and CA, which are predominant
at CG-related sites, were suspected to contribute this
bias. Since a large fraction of TG/CA sites are originally
derived from deamination of of methylated CGs [24],
we hypothesize that recreating ancestral CGs may be
the driving force behind this bias. Data released by the
HapMap project and various genome projects afford us
the opportunity to test this hypothesis.
By analyzing the mutation and frequency spectrum of
different derived alleles, while taking the sequence context into account, a significant mutation and fixation
preference towards transition-generated CGs (CG
derived from CA or TG) was observed, while no such
preference was observed for transversion-generated CGs
(CG derived from CC, GG, CT, AG). This mutation and
fixation preference enables the recreation of ancestral
CG dinucleotides lost via hypermutation to CA/TG.

Methods
Data collection

Human SNP data were retrieved from dbSNP (ftp://ftp.
ncbi.nih.gov/snp/, Build 124), and curated by the
method described elsewhere[25]. Briefly, the following
SNPs were selected: nonindel, biallelic, uniquely mapped
to nonrepetitive sequences, validated, and with at least
100 nucleotides (nt) of flanking sequence available both
upstream and downstream from the SNP.
Sequences and reads for multiple species were
retrieved from the NCBI Nucleotide Databasehttp://
www.ncbi.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=nuccore and Traces
Databasehttp://www.ncbi.nih.gov/Traces. Finally, the
chimpanzee(Pan troglodytes, whole genome, 2.82G),
gorilla(Gorilla, 9.54G, unassembled), orangutan
(Pongo, 18.37G, unassembled), and Gibbon(Nomascus,
18.64G, unassembled) genome sequences were used as
outgroups to infer the ancestral allele for the human
SNP.
The allele frequencies at each SNP site were estimated
from flat files downloaded from the International
HapMap Project (http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/downloads/frequencies/, Build 23). The derived-allele
frequency (DAF) for each SNP was estimated in three
populations (unrelated individuals only): Yoruba(YRI),
Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western
Europe(CEU), Japanese and Chinese(ASN); only those

SNPs successfully genotyped in all chromosomes (120,
120, 180 respectively) were kept for further analysis.
Inferring ancestral states of the SNPs

Inferring ancestral states using parsimony may be unreliable if the mutation or substitution rate is high[26]. In
mammalian genomes, CG dinucleotides have a very
high mutation rate [27]; therefore, two methods were
applied to ensure accurate inference of the ancestral
state.
First, MegaBLAST was used to map the human SNPs
and their flanking sequences(100 bp on each side) to the
four outgroup sequences (chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon)[28]. We inferred the ancestral allele only
when the chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan and gibbon
alleles were identical and matched one of the human
SNP alleles. A PERL script was written to retrieve the
human SNPs and their corresponding outgroup alleles
from the MegaBLAST result.
Second, we also downloaded a dataset of 14.3 Mb of
well curated human/chimpanzee/baboon DNA alignments (http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/datasets/MeunierDuret2004/data)[29] and the corresponding human/
rhesus sequences from http://genome.ucsc.edu. Blast
was used to construct new alignments, and the final
alignment length was shortened to 9.4 Mb. Human
SNPs that map to the aligned chimp/baboon/rhesus
sequences were retrieved and the ancestral state inferred
as described above. Given the branch lengths estimated
by Steiper and Young [30] for the primate phylogeny,
reliable inference of the ancestral state can be obtained
using these three outgroups even at CG related positions (Additional file 1).
For CpG islands, a single outgroup (chimpanzee) was
used to infer the mutation direction to maximize the
sample size, and the frequency spectrum was then corrected by Hernadez et al.’s method (Additional file 2)
[26].
Identification of SNPs located in CpG islands

We identified 37,503 CpG islands in the human genome
using the CGi130 program developed by Takai and
Jones (http://cpgislands.usc.edu/)[31,32]. The following
search criteria, considered stringent according to the
authors, were used: i) GC content ≥ 55%, ii) ObsCG/
ExpCG ≥ 0.65, and iii) length ≥ 500 bp.
Gene annotation

The gene annotation for each SNP in our study was
retrieved from the ENSEMBL database (ftp://ftp.
ensembl.org/pub/, version 45), and SNPs were
classified as intergenic, intronic, coding, 5’UTR, 3’UTR,
5’upstream, or 3’downstream. Any SNP classified into
more than one category was removed from the analysis.

Detection of positive selection

A Long-Rang Haplotype test was utilized to detect
recent positive selection. Specifically, the Integrated
Haplotype Score (iHS) was calculated for each SNP, as
described elsewhere[33]. We used the suggested cut-off
value, namely an extreme positive (iHS > 2) or negative
(iHS < -2) iHS score (indicating a longer haplotype associated with the ancestral or the derived allele, respectively), as an indication of recent positive selection.

Recombination hotspots and coldspots

The locations of recombination hotspots and coldspots
were obtained from a fine-scale genetic map estimated
from patterns of genetic variation, which provides a
kilobase-scale resolution of recombination rates [34,35].

Results
Mutation and fixation bias towards recreating ancestral
CGs

Following our previous observation of a strong fixation
bias in favor of derived C/G alleles at CG-related sites
[23], we re-examined the mutation and fixation pattern
of CG dinucleotides on a genome-wide scale, while taking the sequence context into consideration. The CGs
generated by a single mutation from other dinucleotides
were classified into transition-generated CGs (Tsg, CG
derived from CA/TG) and transversion-generated CGs
(Tvg, CG derived from CC/CT/AG/GG). Correspondingly, the dinucleotides derived by mutations from CG
are divided into transition-damaged CGs (Tsd, CA/TG
derived from CG) and transversion-damaged CGs (Tvd,
CC/CT/AG/GG derived from CG). For comparison, the
same mutations located in other sequence contexts (not
preceded by C or followed by G) were used as the control data for each of these mutation types. Analyses
were also done separately for CpG islands and non-CpG
islands, since they have very different mutation patterns
and nucleotide composition.
In the non-CpG island region, the number of mutations in each annotation category varies substantially,
ranging from 819 for transversion-damaged CGs to
19631 for transition-generated CGs for YRI population
(Table 1; Additional file 3 for CEU and Additional file 4
for ASN). A total of 9293 mutations are from CG to
other dinucleotides, among which 91% are to CA/TG,
which is significantly larger than the fraction of transitions for the control data (62%, P < 2.2e-16, Fisher
Exact test). There are 26391 mutations generating new
CGs from other dinucleotides, of which 74% are transitions (derived from CA/TG), which is significantly larger

than the fraction of transitions at control positions
(64%, P < 2.2e-16, Fisher Exact test). Such a biased process, dominated by mutations between CGs and CAs/
TGs, predicts an increase in CG dinucleotides in the
non-CpG island region, and differs significantly from
the trend demonstrated by the control data
(67831:64859, P < 2.2e-16, Fisher Exact test).
In the CpG island region, a different pattern was
found: 559 CGs are generated by mutations from other
dinucleotides while 881 CGs are destroyed by mutations;
there is thus a trend toward decreasing the number of
CGs. The trend is in accordance with that shown by the
control data for CpG island regions (1003 Cs/Gs generated vs. 1748 Cs/Gs destroyed, P = 0.139, Fisher Exact
test), but differs significantly from that in the non-CpG
island region (26391 CGs generated vs. 9293 CGs
destroyed, P < 2.2e-16, Fisher Exact test).
Derived-allele frequencies (DAF) are shown in Figure 1
for YRI (Additional file 5 for CEU, Additional file 6 for
ASN). In the non-CpG island regions, when the derived
allele was not preceded by C or followed by G, transition-generated CGs (Tsg) and transversion-generated
CGs (Tvg) had a similar average DAF in the control
data (0.328 vs. 0.325, P = 0.1019, Mann-Whitney U
test), indicating no intrinsic DAF difference for these
two types of mutations (A/T- > G/C and C/G/T/A> G/C/G/C). However, the average DAF of transitiongenerated CGs (Tsg) was significantly greater than for
the control data (0.349 vs. 0.328, P = 7.6e-12, MannWhitney U test), whereas transversion-generated CGs
(Tvg) had a significantly lower average DAF than for the
control data (0.325 vs. 0.306, P = 1.3e-8, Mann-Whitney
U test). Overall, it suggests a higher probability of
fixation for transition-generated CGs (Tsg) than
for transversion-generated CGs (Tvg)(P < 2.2e-16,

Mann-Whitney U test). Meanwhile, the average DAF of
CGs destroyed by transitions (i.e., CAs/TGs derived
from CGs) did not differ significantly from the control
data (0.309 vs. 0.308, P = 0.65, Mann-Whitney U test),
nor was the average DAF of CGs destroyed by transversions (i.e., CC/GG/CT/AG derived from CGs) significantly different from the control data (0.331 vs 0.314, P
= 0.65, Mann-Whitney U test).
For CpG islands, the DAF for YRI is shown in Figure 1,
and in Additional file 5 for CEU and Additional file 6 for
ASN. Transition-generated CGs (Tsg) had a much higher
DAF than transversion-generated CGs (Tvg)(0.379 vs.
0.326 for YRI, P = 0.023, Mann-Whitney U test). However, the control data showed the same trend (0.355 vs.
0.313, P = 0.0058, Mann-Whitney U test).
To investigate the influence of potential errors in
assigning ancestral alleles on the above analyses, 9.4 Mb
multiple sequence alignments of human/chimpanzee/
baboon/rhesus were created by another method and
analyzed. The same mutation and fixation patterns were
observed (Additional file 7, Additional file 8).

Selection on the CG dinucleotides?

To investigate if the above results might reflect selection
on functional elements, the SNPs were classfied into
four categories: intergenic non-CpG island; genic nonCpG island; intergenic CpG island; and genic CpG
island (genic regions included the sites annotated as
intronic, coding, 5’UTR, 3’UTR, 5’upstream, 3’downstream). Normally, intergenic, non-CpG island regions
are regarded as neutral, so if selection is playing a role
in the trends we observed, there should be differences
between genic and intergenic patterns. However, we
found similar patterns in genic and intergenic regions
(Table 1).
We also applied the iHs test for signals of recent positive selection on newly-generated CG dinucleotides.
Newly-generated CGs with iHs < -2 may be under
positive selection while whose iHs > 2 may be under
negative selection. Among 16843 transition-generated
CGs, there were 322 (1.9%) with iHs < -2, which is not
significantly different from the fraction of transitiongenerated Cs/Gs in the control data with iHs < -2 (2.1%,

P = 0.1462, Fisher’s Exact test). Similar results were
obtained for transversion-generated CGs (Table 2).
Overall, there is no evidence that newly-generated CGs
are under recent positive selection.
With the phylogeny of ((((((CG,CA)CA)CA)CA)CG)
CG) for ((((((human1,human2)chimpanzee)gorilla)orangutan)gibbon)rhesus)(phylogeny tree is shown in Additional file 9), phylogenetic analyses can reveal situations
where an ancestral CG mutated to CA and then back to
CG in the human lineage. A total of 34 SNPs were identified as back-mutations to CGs, of which three had a
significant iHs value (Table 3), which is higher than the
fraction of mutations with significant iHs values in the
control data (P = 0.011, Chi-square test). All three significant iHs values involve transition-generated CGs
rather than transversion-generated CGs.

towards the C/G allele in the process of repair of double-strand breaks induced by recombination[36]. If the
BGC effect is responsible for the fixation preference
observed here (namely, transition-generated CGs are
more prone to be fixed in the genome compared with
the control data), then recombination hotspots and
coldspots should differ. The result is shown in Figure 2

In the recombination hotspots, C/G derived from T/A
had a much higher DAF than T/A that derived from C/
G (0.347 vs. 0.304, P < 2.2e-16, Mann-Whitney U Test),
which is in accordance with BGC effect. Meanwhile, the
DAF was significantly greater for CG derived from CA/
TG than for the control data (0.365 vs. 0.348, P < 2.2e16, Mann-Whitney U Test), whereas the DAF of TG/
CA derived from CG didn’t differ significantly from the
control data (0.296 vs. 0.304, P = 0.546, Mann-Whitney
U Test). In the recombination coldspots, T/A derived
from C/G had the same average DAF as that of C/G
derived from T/A (0.316 vs. 0.320, P = 0.989, MannWhitney U Test), indicating that the fixation bias
toward C/G disappeared in regions of low recombination, which is expected under BGC model. However, the
DAF of CG derived from CA/TG is still higher than
that of CA/TG derived from CG (0.343 vs. 0.290, P =
0.1717, Mann-Whitney U test), as well as that of the
control data (0.343 vs. 0.320, P = 0.230, Mann-Whitney
U test), but not statistically significant. Overall, these
results indicate that the tendency observed in our study
might be partially explained by recombination, further
study is needed to address this question.

Specifically, there are about three times as many mutations generating new CGs as mutations eliminating
CGs, mainly due to the overwhelming number of mutations from CA/TG to CG. Furthermore, transition-generated CGs had a higher average DAF than
transversion-generated CGs, and in comparison to control data, transition-generated CGs had a significantly
higher DAF while transversion-generated CGs had a significantly lower DAF. Since most CA/TG dinucleotides
are derived from deamination of 5-methylcytosine, many
mutations from CA/TG to CG should be back-mutations after CG mutated to CA/TG. This scenario
thereby recreates ancestral CGs in the genome while
preventing novel CGs that derived from CC/CT/AG/
GG.
By contrast, in CpG island regions, which are relatively abundant in CG dinucleotides, there seems to be
a tendency toward reducing the number of CG dinucleotides. This may reflect evolution from a non-equilibrium GC content in such regions, as the equilibrium
GC content in the human genome is estimated to be
33%-42%[29], which is much lower than the present GC
content (> 55%).

Discussion

Natural selection or neutral mechanism?

Mutation and fixation bias recreating ancestral CGs

Although the preference for transition-generated CGs
was observed both in intergenic and genic regions, it
could be driven by natural selection as many regulatory elements are located in intergenic regions
[40-43]. The assumption of the selection test we
applied is that, if the higher average DAF was caused
by positive selection on these transition-generated
CGs, a larger proportion of the CGs should exhibit
signals of positive selection, compared with the control dataset. However, no difference between the CG
and control data was observed, indicating that newlygenerated CGs were not excessively subject to recent
positive selection (Table 2). The analysis of inferred
back-mutations similarly indicated that such backmutations also were not significantly influenced by
recent positive selection.
It should be noted that the failure to detect the signal
of recent positive selection could also have other explanations. The present methods for detecting the signal of
recent positive selection are mainly targeted at a region
rather than a specific locus [33,44], and identifying causal variants is quite challenging. Since positive signals
may come from hitchhiking with the selected allele,
applying such methods to isolated sites rather than a
genomic region may lack sufficient power. Moreover,
weak selection would be difficult to detect as well.
Therefore, these results do not rule out some role for
selection in producing the patterns observed in this
study.

The observation that CG dinucleotides are under-represented in vertebrate genomes has received much attention. Much evidence suggests that the observed
deficiency of CG dinucleotides is caused by hypermutable methylated cytosine, which mainly exists as the CG
dinucleotide in vertebrate genomes[24]. This is further
supported by the observation that 90% of the mutations
from CGs are transitions to CA/TG in our study,
accompanied with the overrepresentation of TG/CA in
the genome reported by others [24]. More directly,
when the CGs in CpG islands become methylated, CGs
mutate to TG/CA at a comparatively high rate [37]. It is
estimated that the advent of heavily methylated genomes
dates to approximately 450 million years ago, leading to
a lower CG frequency [38,39]. Meanwhile, CpG islands
which were thought to lack methylation were also being
lost [15,17,18].
Yet the methylated CG dinucleotide acts as an essential substrate for many regulatory reactions [8]. This was
believed to be a high fidelity process, until studies
revealed the possibility of deleterious mutations induced
by deamination of 5-methylcytosine [12-14]. The question then arose as to whether CG dinucleotides would
vanish from the genome.
In our study, by analyzing the mutations involving CG
dinucleotides in non-CpG island regions, a strong tendency toward increasing CG dinucleotides was observed,
due to biased mutation and fixation patterns.

Extension of BGC model?

As an alternative to selection, the BGC model is a neutral process that increases the probability of fixation of
mutations that increase GC content in the human genome [20,45]. It is therefore of interest to investigate if
our findings can be explained via an extension of the
BGC model in the context of CG dinucleotides, in particular the fixation preference for recreating ancestral
CGs, or if some other mechanism must be invoked.
Recombination was reported to be the cause of BGC
[29,46] and this is supported in our study, as the fixation
preference for C/G rather than A/T exists in recombination hotspots, but not in the recombination coldspots.
The fixation preference for transition-generated CGs we
observed in our study might be partially driven by the
recombination, as there were no significant difference
between recombination hotspots and coldspots. However, more evidence is needed to address this question, as
we have a rather small sample size in this analysis.

Conclusion
In this study, we identified a trend that could be responsible for generating new CG dinucleotides in non-CpG
islands, which are otherwise deficient in the human genome; namely, an excess number of mutations from CA/
TG to CG, which in turn recreates ancestral CG dinucleotides in the human genome that had been previously
lost by mutation. It appears that neutral process, which
might be partly associated with recombination, is responsible for this trend. By contrast, in CpG island regions,
which are relatively abundant in CG dinucleotides, a tendency toward reducing the number of CG dinucleotides
was observed. Overall, our results shed further light on
the fate of CG dinucleotides in the genome.
Additional material
Additional file 1: Illustration of the reliability of the parsimony
method to count the mutations at CpG related sites using three
outgroups: chimpanzee/baboon/rhesus. The phylogeny of the four
species used to infer mutations is shown in (a). Branch length indicates
the rate of substitution per site at non-CpG positions. Substitution rates
at CpG sites are 10 times higher than that at non-CpG sites, (b) scenario
when the parsimony method is reliable, (c) scenario when the parsimony
method is not reliable. Scenario (b) is 10 times more likely to be
observed than scenario (c). Comparably, if chimpanzee, baboon, or
rhesus is used as a single outgroup respectively, the probability ratio
between (b) and (c) would be 2:1, 0.4:1, or 0.4:1.
