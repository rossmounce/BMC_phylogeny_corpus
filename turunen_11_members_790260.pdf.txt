Abstract
Background: Spermatozoa leaving the testis are not able to fertilize the egg in vivo. They must undergo further
maturation in the epididymis. Proteins secreted to the epididymal lumen by the epithelial cells interact with the
spermatozoa and enable these maturational changes, and are responsible for proper storage conditions before
ejaculation. The present study was carried out in order to characterize the expression of a novel Pate (prostate and
testis expression) gene family, coding for secreted cysteine-rich proteins, in the epididymis.
Methods: Murine genome databases were searched and sequence comparisons were performed to identify
members of the Pate gene family, and their expression profiles in several mouse tissues were characterized by RTPCR. Alternate transcripts were identified by RT-PCR, sequencing and Northern hybridization. Also, to study the
regulation of expression of Pate family genes by the testis, quantitative (q) RT-PCR analyses were performed to
compare gene expression levels in the epididymides of intact mice, gonadectomized mice, and gonadectomized
mice under testosterone replacement treatment.
Results: A revised family tree of Pate genes is presented, including a previously uncharacterized Pate gene named
Pate-X, and the data revealed that Acrv1 and Sslp1 should also be considered as members of the Pate family.
Alternate splicing was observed for Pate-X, Pate-C and Pate-M. All the Pate genes studied are predominantly
expressed in the epididymis, whereas expression in the testis and prostate is notably lower. Loss of androgens
and/or testicular luminal factors was observed to affect the epididymal expression of several Pate genes.
Conclusions: We have characterized a gene cluster consisting of at least 14 expressed Pate gene members,
including Acrv1, Sslp1 and a previously uncharacterized gene which we named Pate-X. The genes code for
putatively secreted, cysteine-rich proteins with a TFP/Ly-6/uPAR domain. Members of the Pate gene cluster
characterized are predominantly expressed in the murine epididymis, not in the testis or prostate, and are
regulated by testicular factors. Similar proteins are present in venoms of several reptiles, and they are thought to
mediate their effects by regulating certain ion channels, and are thus expected to have a clinical relevance in
sperm maturation and epididymal infections.

Background
Spermatozoa leaving the testis are immotile while their
epididymal maturation is known to be essential for the
attainment of progressive motility, and for the abilities
to recognize and fertilize the oocyte [1,2]. This maturation process is associated with interaction between spermatozoa and epididymal luminal fluid that bring about
changes in sperm membrane structure through removal,
addition, and reorganization of the lipid bilayer of the
plasma membrane of spermatozoa [3]. Studies have
shown that each epididymal region has a distinct function governed by region-specific gene expression [4-7].
Protein families with highly segment-specific expression
in the epididymis include, for example, defensins, lipocalins, proteases, protease inhibitors, proteins with a disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain (ADAMs) and
cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs) [8-12]. Regionspecific expression of members of these families is
thought to be, at least partially, responsible for creating
the region-specific luminal environment essential for
epididymal sperm maturation.
Interestingly, several cysteine-rich secreted epididymal
proteins, especially CRISPs, have also been identified in
venoms of various reptiles [13]. The disulfide bridges
between the conserved cysteine residues are thought to
help maintaining the structure of the venom proteins in
the hostile environment of the target prey’s bloodstream
[14,15]. Similarly, the dehydrated epididymal luminal
fluid is a challenging environment for proteins, and,
thus, stability provided by disulfide bridges may be
essential for maintaining protein function [16]. Based on
their predicted structural properties these cysteine-rich
proteins may participate in non-specific defense
mechanisms against micro-organisms in the epididymal
lumen and/or maturation of the spermatozoa via regulating the activities of certain ion channels, although the
exact molecular mechanisms responsible for their functions are still poorly known.
Recently two research groups have independently
identified a genomic locus from various mammalian
species, including human, with several genes encoding
predicted secreted proteins with a cysteine-rich TFP/Ly6/uPAR domain [15,17]. The gene family was named
Anlp (a-neurotoxin-like protein) and Pate by the two
groups. The TFP/Ly-6/uPAR domain has 8-10 highly
conserved cysteine residues, but their distribution differs
from that of cysteine-rich domain of CRISPs [18]. The
cysteines of known PATE proteins form two motifs: C
[XX]C[X7-8]C[X6]C[X7-8]C and C[X3]C[X15-16]CC[X4-5]
CN, where X stands for any amino acid and the superscripts denote their number, and the N stands for asparagine, which is also conserved. Similarly to CRISPs, the
TFP/Ly-6/uPAR domain is identified in snake toxins

[19], but the domain is present in certain membrane
receptors as well [20,21]. Furthermore, the domain was
found in murine Ly-6 proteins, and is, thus, termed the
TFP/Ly-6/uPAR domain [18]. It confers no known enzymatic activity but binds to a wide range of cell surface
receptors, ion channels and enzymes [22,23]. Of PATE
proteins mouse (m) PATE-B has been shown to inhibit
Ca 2+ uptake of spermatozoa [24], and mPATE-C,
mPATE-P and human (h) PATE-B modulate nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) [17].
Most of the Anlp/Pate family members have been
reported to be predominantly expressed in the prostate
and the testis, whereas the UniGene entries show high
epididymal expression. In the present study we studied
the expression of several Pate family genes in the male
reproductive organs with a particular focus in the epididymis, and provide evidence of their regulation by
androgens and other testicular factors. In addition, by
comparing published data of the genes to the current
annotations in the Ensembl and NCBI databases, a putative novel member of the family was discovered.

Methods
Identification of the Pate-family members and analyses in
silico

Bioinformatic tools at Ensembl [25] and the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [26] websites were used to study annotated and predicted genes
in mouse chromosome 9 at location A4. The annotations and predicted PATE-family protein sequences
were compared with the mouse genomic databases and
to sequences published previously [15,17] by BLAST
[27]. The ClustalW program [28] was used to align the
identified amino acid sequences, the signal peptide cleavage sites were identified with SignalP 3.0 [29], and
polyadenylation sites were identified with the Poly(A)
Signal Miner program [30]. Phylogenetic trees including
PATE-family members were constructed with the
MEGA4 program [31].
Experimental animals and RNA extraction

C57BL/6N male mice were used throughout the study
(Harlan Laboratories, Inc., Indianapolis, IN). All animal
handling was conducted in accordance with Finnish
Animal Ethics Committee and the Institutional animal
care policies of the University of Turku (Turku, Finland), which fully meet the requirements as defined in
the NIH Guide on animal experimentation. The mice
were housed under controlled environmental conditions
(12 h light/12 h darkness, temperature 21 ± 1°C) and
fed with standard pelleted chow and tap water ad libitum. To analyze the tissue distribution of gene expression, various tissues were isolated from 7-8 week-old

and specific reaction conditions are presented in Table 2.
Sequencing of the PCR products was performed at the
Finnish Microarray and Sequencing Centre (Turku,
Finland). For Pate-M qRT-PCR primer pair Pate-M F3Pate-M R3 was used. To analyze regulation of gene
expression by androgens qRT-PCR analyses were performed. All qRT-PCR analyses were done in triplicates.
DNase treatment and cDNA synthesis was carried out as
described above, and DyNAmo Flash SYBR Green (FinnZymes) was used for qPCR. The relative standard curve
method was used to calculate the gene expression levels,
and qRT-PCR results on L19 were used for normalization. All statistical analyses were performed by using the
SigmaPlot program (Systat Software Inc., Point Richmond, CA). Gene expression levels were compared with
Student’s t test, and standard deviations are shown as
error bars.

mice for RNA extraction. To analyze the androgen
dependency of gene expression, 12 sexually mature male
mice (divided into 4 groups of 3 mice) were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of 400-600 μl 2.5%
Avertin (2-2-2 tribromoethanol, Aldrich Chemical Co.,
Milwaukee, WI). Three groups (nine mice) were gonadectomized, while the fourth group served as controls.
Testosterone (T) treatment was given to one group of
gonadectomized mice by subcutaneous 1 cm long
SILASTIC silicon tubes (Dow Corning, Inc., Midland,
MI; inner diameter = 1.98 mm, outer diameter = 3.18
mm) filled with T powder (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St.
Louis, MO). The treatment provides T levels above the
normal level of WT male mice [32]. The proximal epididymides were collected 8 hours and 1 day after gonadectomy from the non-treated mice, and after 7 days of
T-treatment, and from the un-operated control group.
Total RNA was isolated using the TRI Reagent (Life
Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA).

Northern hybridization

For Northern hybridization 20 μg of total RNA or 4 μg
of poly-A mRNA extracted from different segments of
the epididymis were denatured, separated on a 1% denaturing agarose gel, and transferred onto nylon membrane
(Hybond-XL,
Amersham
Biosciences,
Buckinghamshire, UK). Probes for detecting the Pate-C
mRNAs were generated by RT-PCR using primer pair
Pate-C F3-Pate-C R3 (Table 2) from total RNA of caput
epididymidis and labeled with [32P]aCTP. Probe hybridization was detected by autoradiography using X-ray film
(Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) or a phosphor
imager (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd.).

RT-PCR and qRT-PCR

RT-PCR was performed to analyze the tissue distribution of Pate family gene expression. The tissues studied
are listed in Table 1. One μg of total RNA from each
tissue was DNase treated with Amplification Grade
DNase I (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and reverse transcribed with DyNAmo cDNA Synthesis Kit (FinnZymes,
Espoo, Finland). Biotools DNA polymerase (Biotools,
Madrid, Spain) was used for PCR. For Pate-C primer
pair Pate-C F1-Pate-C R1 and for Pate-M primer pair
Pate-M F1-Pate-M R1 were used. All primer sequences

Results and discussion
Pate gene family

All known mouse Pate genes reside in a single cluster of
1.13 Mb in length, in chromosome 9 at location A4
(Figure 1A). Most members consist of three exons,
although this is not a strictly conserved feature. The
genes code for 98-125 amino acids (aa) long proteins
(Table 3) containing a signal peptide sequence and the
TFP/Ly-6/uPAR domain with a highly conserved distribution of 10 cysteine residues. In two studies, 14 [17]
and 8 [15] expressed members of the family have been
observed, including Acrv1 (acrosomal vesicle protein 1)
[33] and Sslp1 (secreted seminal vesicle Ly-6 protein 1)
[34], which also code for proteins containing the

Page 4 of 11

aforementioned features characteristic for PATE proteins and should, thus, also be considered as members
of the family based on sequence similarities and phylogenetic analyses. However, as the names Acrv1 and
Sslp1 are already established in literature, we do not
propose their re-naming.
In addition, our examination of the Pate genomic
cluster revealed a previously uncharacterized gene
9230113P08Rik. The current annotation in Ensembl
indicates that the gene codes for a 93 aa long truncated
PATE-like protein, lacking the signal peptide sequence
and the three N-terminal cysteines characteristic for
PATE proteins. However, we identified by RT-PCR and
sequencing a transcript coding for a protein containing
all defining PATE features (Figure 1B). The predicted
full PATE-like protein is 136 aa in length and has a signal peptide sequence, and contains the ten conserved
cysteines in a pattern closely resembling that of the
other PATE proteins (Figure 2A). Phylogenetic analyses
indicated a close evolutionary relationship between proteins coded by 9230113P08Rik and other Pate genes
(Figure 2B). Similarly, Ensembl annotations of orthologuous genes from several species, such as the rat, dog
and macaque, indicated that the gene codes for a protein belonging to the PATE family. To maintain consistency in nomenclature, we named the gene as Pate-X.
Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses of
published Pate members and the current mouse genome
sequences available in Ensembl and NCBI databases
indicate that the gene known as Pate-F [17] (Anlp4
[15]) does not belong to the family. The gene codes for
a protein containing only 8 cysteines, and lacks the conserved distribution of the cysteines characteristic for
PATE proteins. Furthermore, Pate-G [17] expression
was not observed in any tissues analyzed in the current
study, although several different primer pairs and various PCR conditions were used. Thus, based on previous
publications, current annotations and our experimental
data, we have compiled a revised table of the murine
Pate family, comprised of 15 expressed members (Table
3). The human orthologues identified in database search
are indicated in Table 3.
Interestingly, both the genomic organization and
structure of Pate genes resemble those of genes coding
for toxin proteins in snakes. In mammals, many of these
toxin-like proteins are thought to be involved in defence
against micro-organisms ([15] and references therein).
Snake toxin genes are under constant selective evolutionary pressure in order to help maintain the effectiveness of the venom. Likewise, mammalian antimicrobial
peptide coding genes need to quickly adapt to the ever
changing microbial flora. This may especially concern
the environment of the epididymal lumen, which is not
accessible to the immune cells due to physical barriers

separating blood from the luminal contents, leaving the
defence depending on anti-microbial peptides. Thus, to
provide an extensive protection for the developing spermatozoa against micro-organisms, a large amount of
rapidly evolving antimicrobial protein coding genes is
necessary. Members of the Pate family may represent
such genes.
Alternate transcripts for Pate-family members

In addition to the transcripts coding for proteins with
the defining PATE characteristics, the Ensembl database
lists alternate protein coding transcripts for Pate-C and
Pate-M, but not for other members of the family. However, for Pate-X Ensembl only shows a transcript coding
for a truncated PATE-like protein, whereas we also
detected by RT-PCR and sequencing another transcript
containing an open reading frame for a complete PATE
protein (Figure 1B). For Pate-C 0.3 kb and 1.3 kb transcript sequences were predicted in Ensembl, and their
presence was confirmed by experimental data. The two
first exons of the transcripts are the same, whereas the
third exons differ (Figure 3A). Only the 1.3 kb transcript
codes for a protein with the ten cysteine residues characteristic for PATE proteins (Figure 3A.1), and

furthermore, the 0.3 kb transcript (Figure 3A.2) was
only barely detectable by qRT-PCR (data not shown). In
addition, we discovered a novel 0.9 kb transcript by
Northern hybridization (Figure 3A.3). The 0.9 kb transcript provided a stronger signal from epididymal total
RNA than the 1.3 kb transcript (Figure 3C). However,
no evidence for alternate splicing resulting to a 0.9 kb
transcript was detected, and the Poly(A) Signal Miner
program [30] identified three polyadenylation sites in
the 1.3 kb mRNA, at positions 695, 699 and 1054
nucleotides from 5’-end, suggesting that the 0.9 kb transcript is produced by alternative usage of the polyadenylation sites rather than alternate splicing. Also,
expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences corresponding
to the transcripts produced by earlier polyadenylation
are presented in the UniGene EST library. However, as
full sequencing of the 0.9 and 1.3 kb transcripts was not
performed, an element of uncertainty regarding the
sequence of the 0.9 kb transcript remains.
For Pate-M the Ensembl database predicted the presence of two transcripts, 1.7 kb and 2.2 kb in length (Figure 3B), and the transcripts are comprised of 11 and 4
exons, respectively (Figure 3B.1 and 3B.2). The 2.2 kb
transcript codes for a protein with all 10 cysteine residues

characteristic for PATE proteins, while the protein coded
by the 1.7 kb transcript lacks the C-terminal cysteinedoublet and the conserved CN pair. In addition, we
detected two alternatively spliced isoforms by RT-PCR
and sequencing, 2.2 kb and 1.7 kb in size. The alternative
2.2 kb transcript lacks exon six that results in a loss of
eight amino acids, although no cysteines are lost and the
reading frame is unaltered (Figure 3B.4). Furthermore,
this transcript is similar to the other Pate family transcripts by being comprised of three exons, and codes for
a protein retaining all PATE characteristics. An alternatively spliced isoform of the 1.7 kb transcript lacks the
exon 10 that causes a deletion of 15 amino acids, and
alters the reading frame at the C-terminal part of the
protein (Figure 3B.3). However, the PATE signature
domains are not affected. Of all the transcripts detected
the 2.2 kb one containing four exons and all the

conserved PATE elements is the predominant form.
Although alternate protein coding transcripts for Pate-C
and Pate-M are expressed, their expression levels in the
male reproductive tract are clearly lower than those coding for proteins with all ten cysteine residues. Furthermore, even minor differences in the conserved
distribution of cysteine residues will cause loss of sulfur
bridges, and thus, alter the three-dimensional structure,
potentially leading to major changes in the function. The
highly conserved structures of Pate genes and proteins
also likely lead to functional redundancy within the
family, giving the opportunity of novel forms to evolve
through mutations without compromising the existing
functions of the proteins. The presence of these novel
transcripts as well as their distinct expression patterns
compared with the predominant transcripts may imply
the occurrence of such evolution.

Pate-genes are predominantly expressed in reproductive
organs in male mice

We studied the expression of several Pate family members in 24 male mouse tissues, in different segments of
the epididymis [initial segment (IS), caput, corpus and
cauda] and dorsal and ventral prostate by RT-PCR.
With the exceptions of placental Pate-P and Pate-Q the
members studied were predominantly expressed in male
reproductive organs, with Pate, Pate-A, Pate-C, Pate-DJ,
Pate-N, Pate-X and Sslp1 showing no expression in
non-reproductive organs. Expression in the testis was
detected for Pate-B (barely detectable), Pate-E (barely
detectable), Pate-M, Pate-Q and Acrv1, and in the prostate for Pate-B, Pate-H, Pate-X (barely detectable), Sslp1
and Acrv1. However, with the exception of Pate-P all
the members studied were expressed in the epididymis,
and the mRNA expression levels were also highest in
the epididymis, except for Pate-Q, Pate-B, Pate-H, Acrv1
and Sslp1. Furthermore, several Pate members presented
segment specific differences in the expression within the
epididymis (Figure 4). The complete expression profiles
for all analyzed Pate-genes are presented in Table 1.
The Pate family has been named based on their
expression in the testis and prostate. However, the UniGene database suggested that the genes are expressed in

the epididymis in mice rather than the testis or prostate,
while the epididymis had not been included in all previous expression studies [17,33-35]. In the current study
we have confirmed the predominant epididymal expression of Pate family genes. Furthermore, the expression
in the testis or prostate was limited only to a minority
of the members.
There is only limited experimental evidence for the
functions of PATE proteins, but their strong expression
in the epididymis and their resemblance to snake toxin
proteins provide valuable information in this regard as
well. Most toxin proteins exert their function by regulating the activities of certain ion-channels, and hPATE-B,
mPATE-C and mPATE-P have been shown to affect
through nACHRs [17], and mPATE-B to regulate Ca2+
transport [24]. Although the sperm acrosome reaction
has been shown to be mediated through nAChRs [36],
the majority of acetylcholine effects in spermatozoa is
thought to be carried out by muscarinic AChRs [37],
indicating that the PATE proteins may not interact with
the spermatozoa directly. However, hPATE-B has been
shown to bind to spermatozoa, and due to mediation of
Ca 2+ transport, a role in regulation of the acrosome
reaction has been suggested [24]. Based on gene and
protein similarities with toxins and anti-microbial properties of mammalian toxin-like proteins ([15] and references therein), it is also possible that the PATE proteins
participate in defense against pathogens in the immune
cell-free environment of the epididymal lumen. However, the anti-microbial properties of PATEs remain to
be evaluated.
Regulation of Pate-family gene expression by androgens
and luminal factors

Predominant expression of Pate family genes in the
male reproductive organs suggests regulation by testicular factors, and Pate-B, Pate-E and Sslp1 have previously
been reported to be regulated by androgens [17,34]. We
further studied the effect of androgens and other testicular factors on Pate family members’ expression by
comparing expression levels in the IS and caput epididymidis of intact mice, gonadectomized mice and gonadectomized mice receiving testosterone treatment.
Typically, genes expressed in the caput epididymidis are
regulated by circulating testosterone, whereas testicular
factors secreted into the lumen regulate genes expressed
in the IS (lumicrine regulation) [38,39]. Our results
show that gonadectomy has an effect on Pate gene
expressions, although long term effects were detected
only in selected members. The qRT-PCR results are presented in Figure 5. Pate-H, Pate-P, Pate-Q and Sslp1,
which are not strongly expressed in the proximal epididymis of the intact mice, did not show gain of expression after gonadectomy (data not shown).

Interestingly, 8 h after gonadectomy the expression of
most of the Pate genes were up-regulated 2- to 4-fold,
with the exception of Pate, which was down-regulated.
However, in most cases the expression returned to pregonadectomy levels 1 day after gonadectomy. The initial
increase in expression is associated with the sudden loss
of testosterone and suggests partial regulation by androgens, but the subsequent normalization of expression
levels indicates that androgens are not sole regulators of
the genes. Although unlikely, the possibility that the surgery itself affects gene expression can not be excluded.
Only Pate-C and Pate-N mRNA levels were significantly
up- and down-regulated, respectively, 1 day after gonadectomy (P = 0.009 and P = 0.033). Explicit lumicrine
regulation was detected for Pate-A and Pate-N, whose
expression was reduced to close to the detection limit 7
days after gonadectomy in mice receiving exogenous testosterone (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively). A 2fold reduction was similarly detected for Pate-X and
Acrv1 (P = 0.012 and P = 0.045, respectively). Pate-A
and Pate-N are expressed in the IS at higher levels than
in the caput, and, thus, these data well agree with current models of lumicrine regulation of epididymal genes
predominantly expressed in the IS [38,39].

Conclusions
Members of the Pate family are predominantly expressed
in reproductive organs in male mice, and with the exceptions of Pate-P and Pate-Q all members studied showed
strong expression in the epididymis. The family consists
of at least 14 expressed members, including Acrv1, Sslp1
and
the
previously
uncharacterized
gene
(9230113P08Rik) which we named Pate-X, putatively
coding for a PATE family protein. Our studies show that
gonadectomy affects the expression of most Pate genes,
and that Pate-A and Pate-N are regulated by lumicrine
testicular factors. The Pate family genes code for putatively secreted, cysteine-rich proteins with a TFP/Ly-6/
uPAR domain. Similar proteins are present in venoms of
several reptiles, and they are thought to mediate their
effects by regulating certain ion channels. The structure
and predominant epididymal expression suggest that
PATE proteins may function as anti-microbial peptides
in the epididymal luminal fluid. The family has also been
characterized in the human (Table 3 and [15,17]), and its
members may have clinical relevance in epididymal infections and in sperm maturation and fertility.
