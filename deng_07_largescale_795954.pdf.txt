Abstract
Background: Bird genomes have very different compositional structure compared with other
warm-blooded animals. The variation in the base skew rules in the vertebrate genomes remains
puzzling, but it must relate somehow to large-scale genome evolution. Current research is inclined
to relate base skew with mutations and their fixation. Here we wish to explore base skew
correlations in bird genomes, to develop methods for displaying and quantifying such correlations
at different scales, and to discuss possible explanations for the peculiarities of the bird genomes in
skew correlation.
Results: We have developed a method called Base Skew Double Triangle (BSDT) for exhibiting
the genome-scale change of AT/CG skew as a two-dimensional square picture, showing base skews
at many scales simultaneously in a single image. By this method we found that most chicken
chromosomes have high AT/CG skew correlation (symmetry in 2D picture), except for some
microchromosomes. No other organisms studied (18 species) show such high skew correlations.
This visualized high correlation was validated by three kinds of quantitative calculations with
overlapping and non-overlapping windows, all indicating that chicken and birds in general have a
special genome structure. Similar features were also found in some of the mammal genomes, but
clearly much weaker than in chickens. We presume that the skew correlation feature evolved near
the time that birds separated from other vertebrate lineages. When we eliminated the repeat
sequences from the genomes, the AT and CG skews correlation increased for some mammal
genomes, but were still clearly lower than in chickens.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that BSDT is an expressive visualization method for AT and CG
skew and enabled the discovery of the very high skew correlation in bird genomes; this peculiarity
is worth further study. Computational analysis indicated that this correlation might be a
compositional characteristic, present not only in chickens, but also remained or developed in some
mammals during evolution. Special aspects of bird metabolism related to e.g. flight may be the
reason why birds evolved or retained the skew correlation. Our analysis also indicated that
repetitive DNA sequence elements need to be taken into account in studying the evolution of the
correlation between AT and CG skews.

Background
According to Chargaff's second parity rule, the two complementary nucleotides will have similar frequencies in
complete single stranded DNA (A = T, C = G) [1]. However, local violations of this parity rule have been
observed in all known organisms and in bacteria [2]. Thus
AT skew (A-T)/(A+T) and CG skew (C-G)/(G+C) can vary
wildly in local genome scales. The base skews have been
found closely related to genome function domains, such
as the origin of replication, gene distribution, transcription and replication direction in bacteria [3-5], plants [6]
and mammals [7-9]. An intriguing question is, do the two
nucleotide skews (for AT and CG) correlate with each
other? Actually, the AT and CG skew are often discussed
simultaneously [10,11]. Correlations between AT and CG
skews in bacterial genomes and in organellar genomes are
also mentioned in several reports [12,13]. Touchon et al.
found that TA and GC skews in the coding strand for
intronic regions (repeat masked) in human are correlated,
and the correlation value is around 0.61 [14]. Thus studying the relation between the AT/CG skews is equally
important as the variability in the two skews, and both
may have evolutionary meaning for genome composition. The correlations between AT skew and CG skew in
higher organisms were generally studied in sets of segments in coding regions or noncoding regions, such as
introns and some repeat elements which represent
selected or neutral mutations, respectively [15]. Such
studies have focused more on mutation mechanisms
[7,8,15]. However, the skew correlations have seldom
been considered in whole genome or chromosome scale.
In earlier research, CG-skews have normally been analyzed by using cumulative skew diagrams [10,15].
Recently, AT and CG skews were analyzed simultaneously
by Touchon et al [9], who calculated cumulative total
skew as sum of AT and CG skews over 1 kb non-overlapping windows, enabling prediction of replication origins
in mammalian genomes. Software for visualization of GC
skew for circular bacterial genomes has been developed
[16]. Another similar package is Genome Diagram [17],
but methods for larger genomes are needed. We developed a new method enabling handy large-scale visualization and analysis of AT and CG skews for whole genomes
and large eukaryotic chromosomes, which is very informative. This new method of 2-D color visualization can represent AT skew and CG skew of all segments up to total
length or multiple of 1/1024 of the whole genome in a
single figure. We call the tool Base Skew Double Triangle
(BSDT). After drawing BSDT images of eukaryotic chromosomes, we found that for chicken and other bird chromosomes, the correlations between the two skews show
up very clearly and are also quantitatively very high (correlation over 0.95), while such high values are not reached
in chromosomes of any other eukaryote species. We then

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/234

used further two quantitative methods and different window steps to validate these correlations.
Compared to mammals, chicken/bird genomes have
more compact structure, with higher gene density, fewer
repeat sequences and specific base skew structure [18,19].
Masking out repetitive sequences prior to analysis from all
genomes showed that the level of skew correlation is still
higher in birds. We think this has some biological and
evolutionary meaning, still to be unraveled. From the
increase in correlation values after masking repeats, it
seems to be a feature related to evolution of the nonrepeat component of the genomes. Our 2-D visualization
method is considered to be useful in the study and comparison of nucleotide skews at different scales in various
genomes in understanding this phenomenon and its evolution in the phylogenetic tree.

Results
BSDTs for eukaryote chromosomes
Our new 2-D color visualization representing AT and CG
skews was used, as described in methods, to draw the
BSDT pictures (see Methods and Figure 1) for 379 chromosomes of 19 fully sequenced species and two bird species for which extensive genomic scaffold sequences were
available. All the BSDT pictures can be found at our website, under link of BSDT Examples[20]. Visual inspection
already shows that the bird chromosomes have the most
symmetrical BSDTs, even at large scale. The symmetry
phenomenon suggests that there is a high correlation
between AT and CG skew in chicken and other birds when
overlapping windows are used to slide through the whole
DNA sequence. The visual symmetry was validated by
three quantitative calculations of correlations.
CNCL – a quantitative index of skew correlation
Constant Number Correlation Level (abbreviated as
CNCL) was defined to depict the symmetry degree of
BSDTs (see Methods) by calculating correlation of the two
base skews at many scales. The degree of the correlation
between AT and CG skews was quantitatively validated by
the calculation of CNCL using overlapping windows. Two
indexes are important for this definition. First, each DNA
sequence is divided into 1024 equal segments (1024 for
easy fitting on a computer screen); all analysis for CNCL
of BSDT pictures is based on this division. Secondly, the
step length of overlapping sliding windows is expressed
by parameter β.

We calculated the CNCL values for all genome data in
Table 1 for β = 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 by equation (5). Figure 2
shows the CNCL values for 60 datasets with the highest
correlations, using β = 20. It is remarkable, that chicken
chromosomes and the pooled genomic scaffold
sequences of two bird species have clearly the highest cor-

this table that birds have higher skew correlation, and no other species reach this level of correlation.

ues can be seen in Table 2.
We also find that, for other vertebrates, a high correlation
level is not common, though most vertebrates tend to
have higher positive correlations than other lower eukaryotes. In Table 2, we list the distribution of CNCL for all
sequenced eukaryotes. Most opossum chromosomes have
unexpectedly negative CNCL, as do pufferfish chromosomes. Nematode has a relatively high negative correlation between AT and CG skews. In a control test, 800 = 5
× 16 × 10 CNCLs of random sequences are calculated,
with length of 1 Mb, 3 Mb, 10 Mb, 30 Mb, 100 Mb (5
scales) and GC percent of 35%, 36%~50% (16 levels) and
10 repeats for each combination of length scale and GC
percent, as listed in Table 2 and details supplied in supplemental file (CNCL for randoms and chromsomes.xls
under link of reference in our website [20]). In all the random control sequences, 98.5% of the |CNCL| values are
under 0.5, 92.1% |CNCL| < 0.4, 79% |CNCL| < 0.3,
56.6% |CNCL| < 0.2, and 30.4% |CNCL| < 0.1. Compared
to the random controls, only warmblooded animal
CNCLs can be far from randomness but not for all their
chromosomes. Chicken and other birds are the only species in which correlation can reach 0.90 (all chicken macrochromosomes are over 0.95) and the exceptions are all
chicken microchromosomes.
Table 2 shows only the case β = 20, however, extensive calculations indicated that different settings of β do not affect
the results significantly. We have:

CNCLchicken-chr. n > CNCLspecies-chromosomes
β1

(1)

for all conceivable combinations of all species (not bird),
and all chromosomes, β1 = 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, β2 = 2, 5, 10,
20, 50 and n = 1 ~ 14, 18 ~20, 23, 24, 26. Thus our conclusion is that for calculation of CNCL in any scale,
chicken chromosomes consistently display distinctly
higher correlation compared to other eukaryotes. Here,
the segmentation to 1024 parts is only a choice for visual
convenience. BSDT is a useful visual observation method,
by which we can easily see which genome areas are of
interest in terms of skew correlations.

CWCL – a generalization of CNCL
It could be thought that the skew correlations might not
represent a common measurement scale, because the
DNA sequences are not of same size, because all are
divided into 1024 segments. For this reason, we define a
new value CWCL (Constant Window Correlation Level),
which does not limit the number of windows to 1024, but
limits the window length. In other words, window
number for a constant window length replaces 1024. This
way we can compare the different genomes in the same
scale. The advantage of CWCL is that any two CWCL can
be compared in the same scale, though it is not visualized
in a common scale square.

We have calculated this standardized scale CWCLspecies −chr*
β
values for all data, β = 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and window-length
= 2 k, 10 k. This allows comparisons in same scale
between chromosomes and species. Since there are so
many possible combinations of beta and window length
(WL), all the results cannot be listed here. Table 3 only
lists the number of chicken chromosomes that rank highest in correlation for any parameter combination. For
example, when β = 5 and window-length = 2 k, 25 top
CWCL values belong to chicken. The conclusion of Table
3 is quite similar with equation (1), but this calculation is
more intuitive, as we are comparing two sequences in the
same scale.
Non-overlapping windows based calculation
Intuition and general knowledge suggests that symmetrical phenomena should happen in comparatively large
scale, but in small scale, random fluctuations should be
dominant. The question is from what scale the chicken/
bird genome begins to exhibit its high correlation
between skews, or in other words, how its variation
changes with the increase of scale. Figure 3A–C shows the
relationships between window-sizes and correlation values, using non-overlapping windows. All chromosomes
of chicken are drawn in green, for easy comparison with
human in red and dog in blue.

It is obvious from Figure 3A that for most chicken chromosomes, the correlation between AT and CG skew rapTable 3: The number of chicken chromosomes that rank highest in correlation for different parameter combinations.

WL is the window length and β has the same meaning as in equation 4 for CNCL. The number in table means how many chicken chromosomes
have top-ranked AT/CG skew correlation among all data in Table 1 with parameter combination of window length and β. For example, when
window length is 2 k and β = 2, 25 chicken chromosomes have top-ranked correlation values when comparing all chromosomes in Table 1.

idly increases to a high level (0.9 at 40 kb and 0.95 at 200
kb or higher), the exceptions being the microchromosomes. For all human and dog chromosomes, none can
reach correlation level of 0.8, even at the scale of 200 kb,
at the right end of Figure 3A. We can also see that dog has
slightly higher correlation level than human, as already
seen in the previous analysis of CNCL and CWCL. This
seems a species-specific difference. A very interesting phenomenon is that all chicken chromosomes begin at positive correlation level, and all chromosomes of human and
dog at negative correlation level at small window sizes.
Also, some chromosomes in all species differ significantly
from the species specific trend (e.g. lowest curve for
human in right panel of Figure 3).
When we eliminated the repeat sequences from the three
animal genomes using the standard repeat-masked
sequences from the public databases (downloaded from
UCSC [21]), the correlations clearly increase in human
and dog, and slightly also in chicken, although they
already were at a very high level (Figure 3B). This made
both dog and human skew correlation levels more similar
to each other and closer to that of birds. However, bird
chromosome value correlations still stand clearly apart,
suggesting that other factors in addition to repeats are
responsible for the special characteristic of skew correlation in birds. We also eliminated the intergenic sequences
from the three animal genomes using the Genescan gene
data in UCSC (see Figure 3C). We only see slight differences between Figure 3C and Figure 3A, but the change is
far from that which occurred when masked the repeat
sequences. This indicates that the skew correlation in the
gene related regions is not significantly different from that
in the whole genome.

Discussion and Conclusion
In this study, we introduced a new visualization method
of BSDT to display the changing rules of AT and CG skews
in the genome. The visual symmetry in BSDT means high
correlation level between AT and CG skews, and high visual symmetry in large scale appeared only in the BSDTs of
bird chromosomes. This indicates bird genomes have a
very special compositional structure in base skew compared to other species. We validated this estimation by
other two quantitative methods, confirming that only
bird genomes can reach a high correlation level (0.95).
Other species, such as dog, horse and human can also
reach a relatively high level (0.8), far from random
sequence expectation. However, such high correlations do
not appear in rodents and fishes, especially, opossum has
an unexpected and unexplained negative correlation. We
think this phenomenon is intriguing evolutionarily. Three
questions arise: 1) When did this high correlation appear
in the vertebrate phylogeny tree? 2) Have birds increased
this symmetry due to some evolutionary pressure or have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/234

other species lost it (from reptilian ancestors)? 3) Why
there are so clear species-specific differences, even within
mammals? The high correlation between AT and CG
skews is likely to be prevalent in other bird genomes as
well, as zebrafinch and turkey genome data showed a very
similar picture. The details of the phylogenetic distribution and evolution of this correlation awaits access to
more genomic data from further species of birds, mammals and primitive vertebrates, like reptiles.
When the skew correlation is higher than 0.95, we can
nearly say that the AT and CG skews change concomitantly. Most chicken larger chromosomes can reach this
level at large scale, and for other animals, we can only say
they also have tendency to increase in larger scale. The
base skew correlation is only a mathematical concept, but
when it is far from random state, it must have a biological
explanation to maintain it. There are so many vertebrate
branches, but why this phenomenon occurred only in the
few branches in birds? We have analyzed current genome
data, from birds, canines, ungulates, primates, rodents,
fishes and marsupials. It is unknown whether the high
correlation occurred early, vanishing in marsupials, or
whether it occurred reappeared in canines, ungulates, primates etc. at a relatively high level. We need to search for
the common ancestor for the high skew correlation state.
It is difficult to judge when birds might have gained such
high base skew correlation, either before or after the separation between mammals and birds. New primitive mammal, marsupial, reptile and amphibian data might clarify
this. While waiting for such data, we can study further the
role of repeat sequences, as well as the history of newly
inserted sequences in the evolution process [22,23]. It
could be that the high correlation phenomenon occurred
very early in the vertebrate phylogeny tree, at least before
the separating point of bird and mammal, and then was
lost to some extent in mammals. Alternatively, this trait
appeared separately in birds and mammals and was
strengthened further in the bird branch. We favor the first
alternative.
We may need to improve the methods of finding and
masking repeat sequences for robust analysis of data from
reptiles and common ancestors of mammals and birds. It
seems a small number of large-scale recombination events
cannot cause an extensive change in skew correlation.
Point mutations also cannot be the main reason, since it
is a relatively short time for this change in vertebrate phylogeny tree, but mutations maybe a contributing factor.
We assume the main reason that most mammals lost the
correlation to some extent was numerous random insertions of small sequences with a high difference in AT and
CG skew. Such events could involve interspersed repeats,
tandem repeats, transposable elements, etc. If we can

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/234

eliminate such repeats in mammal in a clean manner,
mammals may show even higher AT/CG skew correlation,
then being more similar to the ancestral genome. These
repeats have changed during evolution, and were perhaps
not captured well enough by the repeat masking procedure used in the public domain databases, from which we
retrieved our repeat masked data.
As we know, avian genomes are commonly smaller and
have fewer repetitive elements than other amniotes and
that seems a key adaptation for flight [24]. We can also
imagine, for the same goal of extremely efficient cell
metabolism, birds may adopt a highly organized compositional genome structure, including or reflected in high
AT and CG skew correlation. We expect this history to be
unraveled soon after more complete genomes are published. It is unknown what possible advantages does the
similar AT and CG skew give to the species to manage
their genetic information, but it may involve having genes
with similar constitution near each other for easier global
control mechanisms.

Methods
The definition of BSDT
The aim of this method is to visualize how the AT and CG
skews change and correlate at all scales in a single image
for a whole chromosomes. For convenient display on
computer screens, we limit the square scale as 1024 ×
1024 pixels (choice of 1024 is handy for display on ordinary computer screen, but one can choose any other
scale). First, we divide the DNA sequence into 1024 equal
size windows Wi, all possible continuous segments composed with Wi can be denoted as:
n

H m,n =

∪W

i

(2)

i = m −1

i.e. the segments from the beginning of window Wm-1 to
the end of window Wn. Then, we denote the base skews of
AT
AT and CG of all these segments Hm,n as Skew m,n and

CG
Skew m,n , and the whole genome skew denoted as skew

denoted as:

λ = |(A - T)/(A + T)| + |(C - G)/(C + G))|

(3)

in which A, T, C, G are the number of these nucleotides in
the whole sequence. Next, we map the two base skews
AT
CG
Skew m,n and Skew m,n of Hm,n at two symmetrical pixels

(m, n) and (n, m) in the square with a color function, in
order to get a color square representation for each DNA
sequence. This color function is shown in Table 4 and the
corresponding color scale in Figure 4. For all points of the
matrix we draw (m, n) and (n, m) (at the symmetry posiAT
CG
tion) with color ( Skew m,n ) and color ( Skew m,n ) for m ≤ n ≤

1024.
Using the color scheme in Table 4 we thus get a color
square representation for base skews of any DNA
sequence, as shown in Figure 1A–B. This square consists
of two triangles, separated by the diagonal, the bottomleft for the AT skew and the top-right for CG skew. We call
these images Base Skew Double Triangles (BSDT). The
structure of these images is explained further below. Since
each point in the square represents base skew of a different subsequence, 1,0242/2 = 524,288 segments are shown
in one triangle. This display with a suitable color scaling
highlights very clearly and continuously the changes in AT
and CG skews at different scales and in different locations
of the DNA sequence.
What can we see in BSDT?
When observing a BSDT image (see Figure 1), following
items are important: 1) Any point pair ((m, n) and (n, m),
m < n) in the square represents a sub-sequence Hm,n and

the color at these pair points represent base skews
AT
CG
Skew m,n and Skew m,n the similar colors (in Figure 4) of

the two points represent the correlation of two base skews.

skew value, for example 26.0 means when base skew is 26.0λ, the color in BSDT is deep green.

The color function Color(α) is defined as this table, where α is the AT or CG skew and λ is |(A - T)/(A + T)| + |(C - G)/(C + G))| (equation 3) for
whole genome. Since the λ is different for genomes, the color function depends on the value of λ. Corresponding color scale is in Figure 4. Color(α)
maps the AT or CG skew α to a RGB color. For example if the skew value is -3.5λ (top of the third vertical row) the color is (0, 0, 228). The λ may
be different for different chromosomes.

2) The skew level of any segment displayed in the BSDT
shows strong negative skews as deep blue, changing via
black color at no skew to deep green for strong positive
skews (see color scale in Figure 4). 3) The closer the points
to the diagonal, the smaller the sub-sequence scale it represents. 4) The symmetrical color pattern across the diagonal means correlation of CG skew and AT skew of that
genome area. 4) By comparing the color changes along
the diagonal direction we can observe local deviations in
skews and their correlations. It is noteworthy, that in the
corners furthest from the diagonal (= largest genomic
scale) the skew is less (color is often pink or yellow, that
is, closer to black portion in the middle of the color scale).

species-chr* means for which DNA sequence and β means

The definition of constant window correlation level of

CNCL mentioned above is a correlation score of the BSDT
of genomes. However, we know that for different species
and different chromosomes, the genome sequences are

The definition of constant number correlation level of
BSDT
The visual observation clearly supports the conclusion
that the correlation between the AT skew and CG skew is
very high for most large chromosomes of chicken at any
scale. However, adequate quantitative analysis of this visual observation (BSDT) is necessary. For this we calculate
correlation as follows:

Taking 12 pairs of symmetrical lines parallel to the diagonal in the square,

m − n = β × k +1

m − n = β × k +1

(4)

As shown in Figure 5, where k means the line from 1 to 12
in turn and β is the separation between the diagonal lines.
Each line can be considered as a vector of base skew, the
blue lines for AT skews and red lines for CG skews. The 12
pairs of symmetrical lines have 12 correlation numbers Ci,
Positive values of Ci mean positively correlated AT and CG
skews, negative values mean negative correlation. The
average of Ci is defined as constant number correlation
level (CNCL) of the target sequence.

quite different in total length. So the window length will
be different, even though we can compare the CNCLs by
choosing different parameter β values. For standardized
comparison of chromosomes of different sizes, we define
a new constant window correlation level (CWCL), where,
compared with CNCL in last section, factor 1024 is
replaced by

So CNCL is the absolute scale (1/1024 fraction of chromosome) correlation level of BSDT images and CWCL is
the standardized scale correlation level. The arithmetic in
CWCL is as for CNCL, but m, n < Window-number (not
be 1024). CWCL is denoted as CWCLspecies −chr* , speciesβ
chr* and β has the same meaning as in equations (5) for
CNCL.
