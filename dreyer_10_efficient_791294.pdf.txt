An efficient system to generate monoclonal
antibodies against membrane-associated proteins
by immunisation with antigen-expressing
mammalian cells
Anita M Dreyer1,2, Jeremy Beauchamp3, Hugues Matile3, Gerd Pluschke1,2*

Abstract
Background: The generation of monoclonal antibodies specific for protein antigens usually depends on purified
recombinant protein for both immunisation and hybridoma screening. Purification of recombinant protein in
sufficient yield and purity is a tedious undertaking and can be demanding especially in the case of membrane
proteins. Furthermore, antibodies generated against a purified recombinant protein are frequently incapable of
binding to the endogenous protein in its native context.
Results: We describe a strategy to generate monoclonal antibodies against membrane or membrane-associated
proteins that completely bypasses any need for purified recombinant antigen. This approach utilises stably
transfected mammalian cells expressing recombinant antigens on their cell surface for immunisation of mice. The
transfected cells are also used for measuring seroconversion, hybridoma selection and antibody characterisation. By
presenting the antigen in its native conformation for immunisation and hybridoma selection, this procedure
promotes the generation of antibodies capable of binding to the endogenous protein. In the present study, we
applied this approach successfully for three predicted GPI-anchored proteins of the malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum.
Conclusions: The described entirely cell-based technology is a fast and efficient approach for obtaining antibodies
reactive with endogenous cell-surface proteins in their native conformation.

Background
Since the development of the B-cell hybridoma technology for the generation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
in 1975 by Kohler and Milstein [1], mAbs have become
molecular tools of great value. Due to their high specificity, mAbs are used throughout biology for the characterisation of protein function and distribution. Besides
their usage in research, mAbs are also widely utilised as
diagnostic and therapeutic agents [2,3]. Due to this wide
range of applications the generation of mAbs became a
standard procedure. However the generation of mAbs
against protein antigens can still be problematic, since
for studies in physiological settings, it is important that

the mAbs recognise the target protein in its native
conformation.
Frequently, mAbs are raised against synthetic peptides
derived from the predicted sequence of the target protein. Unfortunately, these Abs, though strongly reactive
with peptide, frequently fail to recognise the native protein [4]. Another standard procedure to generate mAbs
uses purified recombinantly expressed proteins. Prokaryotic expression systems are the most widely used
expression hosts. But when studying mammalian surface
proteins it is often necessary to use mammalian expression systems, as they are more likely to produce functional proteins with the appropriate disulfide-bonds and
posttranslational modifications [5,6]. Although introduction of affinity tags simplifies purification, it often
remains difficult to obtain recombinant protein in native
conformation and in sufficient yield and purity. This

applies most notably to membrane and membraneassociated proteins, as they are likely to lose their native
structure during the purification processes [7].
When attempting to generate mAbs capable of recognising the native protein, it is also critical to use the target protein in its native conformation not only in the
immunisation step but also for the screening procedure.
Many standard hybridoma-screening protocols make use
of recombinant proteins immobilized on solid supports,
which may significantly alter protein conformation [8].
With the objective of generating mAbs specifically
recognising membrane-associated proteins in their
native conformation, we applied a methodology that
bypasses any need for purified recombinant protein.
This strategy utilises antigens expressed on the surface
of stably transfected mammalian cells both for immunisation of mice and for immunoassays, such as
testing seroconversion, hybridoma selection and mAb
characterisation.
In the present study, we applied this approach for
three predicted GPI-anchored proteins of Plasmodium
falciparum. P. falciparum is the causative agent of
malaria tropica, which claims 300-600 million clinical
cases and more than 2 million deaths each year [9].
Malaria is transmitted to humans by the bite of an
infected female Anopheles mosquito. The inoculated
sporozoites infect hepatocytes where the parasites
undergo schizogony resulting in the rupture of the
infected liver cell and release of free merozoites, which
infect erythrocytes. Upon intra-erythrocytic schizogony
red blood cells rupture and release more merozoites.
Some of these differentiate into gametocytes, which,
when taken up by a feeding mosquito bring about the
sexual cycle, resulting in the development of sporozoites
located in the salivary gland of the mosquito. Highly
specific cell-cell interactions between the invasive forms
of the parasite and the corresponding host cells are
pivotal steps in the complex life cycle of P. falciparum,
which depend on specific molecular interactions of cell
surface molecules. Being exposed to potentially parasite
inhibitory antibodies makes parasite proteins involved in
cell-cell interactions of particular interest with respect
to vaccine development. Most proteins that coat the
surface of the extracellular forms of P. falciparum are
known or presumed to be GPI anchored [10]. We
anticipated the generation of mAbs against hypothetical
proteins of P. falciparum predicted to be a GPIanchored membrane protein in order to get a tool to
characterize their properties and potential as vaccine
candidate antigens. Based on being predicted to be
expressed in invasive stages and to contain a GPIanchor motif, three hypothetical proteins were selected:
PFF0620c, PFD1130w and PF14_0325. For PFD1130w
and PF14_0325 published transcriptional analysis data

showed elevated expression levels in late stages of the
asexual blood stage cycle [11,12]. For both predicted
proteins no function can currently be assigned as no
significant homology to functional domains of other
characterized gene products could be identified.
PFF0620c contains two S48-45 sexual stage antigen-like
domains, which are characterized by the presence of 6
cysteines. Other members of this protein family have
been shown to be located on the surface of the parasite
and some of them are known to play a role in cell-cell
interactions [13]. Mass spectrometry data indicate
expression of PFF0620c at the sporozoite stage [14].
To achieve surface localisation of the recombinant
P. falciparum proteins on mammalian cells despite
potential differences of the secretory machinery between
Plasmodium and host cells, the P. falciparum coding
sequences were altered in several ways. The endogenous
secretion signal sequences and GPI-attachment sites
were replaced with the signal peptide of bee venom
melittin and the transmembrane domain of mouse glycophorine A, respectively. To allow assessment of surface localization, antibody-tags were introduced on both
sides of the transmembrane domain.
We expect that this entirely cell-based system, capable
of generating mAbs against membrane-associated antigens, is applicable for a wide range of cell-surface
proteins.

Results
Expression of predicted GPI-anchored P. falciparum
proteins on the cell surface of mammalian cells

The three predicted open reading frames (ORFs)
PFF0620c, PFD1130w and PF14_0325 of P. falciparum
were expressed on the cell surface of HEK cells using
the expression plasmids pcDNA3.1_BVM_PFF0620c
_FLAG_GLP_His, pcDNA3.1_BVM_PFD1130W_FLAG_
GLP_His and pcDNA3.1_BVM_PF14_0325_ FLAG_GLP_His, respectively (Figure 1). To ensure expression on
the cell surface, the predicted ORFs were modified in
several ways: i. the endogenous P. falciparum sequences
were codon-optimised for expression in mammalian
cells; ii. the endogenous secretion signal sequences were
replaced by the secretion signal sequence of bee-venom
melittin; iii. for membrane anchoring the transmembrane domain encoding sequence of mouse glycophorin
was used instead of the predicted GPI-attachment signal
sequences; iv. to allow expression analysis, a FLAG tag
was inserted N-terminally of the transmembrane
domain and a hexa-His tag was placed at the C-terminus. The two tags were positioned just before and after
the transmembrane domain to facilitate verification of
the extracellular localisation of the recombinantly
expressed malaria antigens (Figure 2 and additional files
1 and 2).

BVM_PFD1130W_FLAG_GP_His and pcDNA3.1 BVM_PF14_0325_FLAG_GP_His (pcDNA3.1 BVM_P. falciparum ORF_FLAG_GP_His). The
commercially available pcDNA3.1 expression plasmid (Invitrogen) was modified to contain chimeric genes consisting of the secretion signal
sequence of bee venom melittin, the codon-optimised sequence encoding the P. falciparum proteins PFF0620C, PFD1130W or PF14_0325
without secretion signal sequence and GPI-attachment signal sequence, a FLAG tag encoding sequence, a sequence encoding the
transmembrane domain of mouse glycophorin-A and a His tag encoding sequence.

HEK-derived cell lines expressing P. falciparum
PFF0620c, PFD1130W and PF14_0325 were established
by stable transfection. Expression of recombinant proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis using antiHis tag and anti-FLAG tag antibodies. While protein
bands appeared when lysates of the three stably transfected cell lines were analysed, no staining was obtained
with non-transfected HEK cells (data not shown). Also
in immune fluorescence analysis (IFA) transfectants
showed strongly increased staining both with anti-His
tag and with anti-FLAG tag antibodies (data not shown).
To obtain highly expressing cell lines, transfectants
were separated into high-expressing cell-pools by fluorescent-activated-cell-sorting after surface staining with
anti-FLAG tag antibodies. After several days in culture
the mean fluorescence intensities of the high-expressing
cell pools of the transfectants PFF0620c-HEK,
PFD1130W-HEK and PF14_0325-HEK, were ten, seven
and three times higher compared to non-transfected
HEK cells (Figure 3B).
Live-cell staining of PFF0620c-HEK, PFD1130W-HEK
or PF14_0325-HEK cells with anti-FLAG tag antibody
yielded strong signals. In contrast, staining with anti-His
tag antibody gave strong signals on methanol fixed cells

but not on living cells (Figure 4). From these results we
deduced that PFF0620c, PFD1130W and PF14_0325
were expressed and anchored in the cell membrane with
the FLAG tag located extracellularly and the His tag
intracellularly.
Development of malaria antigen specific antibodies in
mice immunised with transfected HEK cells

The high-expressing cell pools PFF0620c-HEK,
PFD1130W-HEK and PF14_0325-HEK were used to
immunise NMRI mice. Mice received intravenous injections of 106 cells on three consecutive days and another
suite of three daily injections two weeks later. Development of serum antibody titres was analysed by flow
cytometry comparing immune-staining of the corresponding transfectants with that of non-transfected HEK
cells (Figure 5). The fluorescence intensity observed with
transfectants was two- to four-fold higher than that of
non-transfected control HEK cells. This indicated that
the mice had mounted an antibody response against the
recombinant malaria antigens expressed on the surface
of the transfected HEK cells.
Spleen cells of mice immunised with the transfected
HEK cells were fused with PAI myeloma cells to generate

production were screened by IFA for antibodies binding to
transfected cells. Transfected and non-transfected HEK
cells spotted onto multiwell glass slides were stained with
individual hybridoma supernatants and analysed by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 6). Non-transfected HEK cells
served as a negative control for each sample. In all three
fusions numerous culture supernatants positive on the
transfected cells were also positive on non-transfected cells.
However, each fusion yielded also numerous wells containing antibodies strongly reactive with transfectants but not
reactive with untransfected HEK cells. Among these, eight
wells were identified that contained antibodies reactive
with an epitope present on all three transfectants but not
on untransfected HEK cells. Most likely, these antibodies
are specific for the FLAG tag or the membrane anchor
domain. All other culture supernatants reactive with transfectants, but not with untransfected HEK cells were specific
for the transfected cells used for immunisation and did not
stain the two other transfectants (Table 1). From wells of
this category, 17, nine and two hybridoma clones (Table 2)
were derived by recloning from the PFF0620c, PFD1130W
and PF14_0325-fusion, respectively.
The specificity of the monoclonal antibodies was
further confirmed by Western blot analysis (Figure 7).
With the exception of one anti-PFF0620c mAb, all 28
mAbs stained the corresponding recombinant protein in

the lysate of the transfectant used for immunisation, but
not in lysates of the other transfectants or of untransfected HEK cells (Table 2). Interestingly, in Western
blot analysis anti-PFF0620c mAbs only bound to the
non-reduced form of the recombinant protein. In contrast, anti-PFD1130w and anti-PF14_0325 mAbs bound
both to the reduced and non-reduced recombinant proteins (data not shown).
Reactivity of the generated monoclonal antibodies with
the endogenous target antigens

To determine whether the generated mAbs selected
against ectopically expressed PFF0620c, PFD1130W or
PF14_0325 would bind to the endogenous proteins of
P. falciparum parasites, we performed IFA and Westernblot analysis using cultivated blood-stage parasites and
mosquito salivary gland-derived sporozoites (Figure 8 &
Table 2). All nine generated anti-PFD1130W mAbs
recognised a discrete band of about 40 kDa, corresponding to the predicted molecular weight of the PFD1130W
protein. Furthermore all nine mAbs stained blood-stage
parasites in IFA, resulting in a distinctive staining pattern
(Figure 8 & Table 2). Both anti-PF14_0325 mAbs
were Western-blot positive on blood stage parasite lysate
and stained specifically late blood stage parasites in IFA
(Figure 8 & Table 2). Thirteen of the seventeen mAbs
specific for PFF0620c reacted in IFA with mosquito salivary gland sporozoites, but not with blood stage parasites
in IFA (Figure 8 & Table 2). No reactivity was seen in
Western blot with sporozoite lysate.

Figure 6 Immunofluorescence microscopic screening of
hybridoma cell culture supernatants for antibodies binding to
cell-surface expressed PFF0620C. PFF0620C-HEK cells (right
column) and untransfected HEK cells (left column) were fixed with
methanol and stained with hybridoma supernatants of individual
cell culture wells taken 15 days after the fusion. A FITC-labelled antimouse IgG antibody served as secondary antibody. Representative
fluorescence micrographs from the PFF0620C-fusion are shown,
demonstrating typical results for hybidoma lines producing
PFF0620C-specific (line 1, 2 & 3), non-binding (line 4), or HEK cell
antigen specific (line 5 & 6) antibodies. For some wells mixed
specificity was seen, indicating presence of two ore more cell
clones with one producing Abs specific for the transgene and the
other producing Abs specific for a HEK-cell protein (line 7).

Discussion
Membrane proteins, including membrane associated
proteins, are the gatekeepers of the cell and selectively
mediate the flow of information and nutrients
between the outside and inside of the cell. Functions
of membrane proteins include: transport of substances
across membranes, enzymatic activity, signal transduction, intercellular joining, cell-cell recognition, attachment to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix.
Even though only 25% of all proteins are membrane
proteins, about 60% of todayâs approved drug targets
are membrane proteins [15]. Also for subunit vaccine
design cell surface associated proteins, which can be
accessed by antibodies, are of prime interest. Nonetheless the basic knowledge about these proteins lags
far behind that of soluble proteins. This is due to difficulties in ectopic expression, purification and protein
stability. Therefore investigation of membrane proteins is a demanding undertaking and generation of
mAbs against membrane proteins represents a difficult task.

Here we described a procedure to generate mAbs specific for cell-surface associated proteins, which completely bypasses any need for purified antigen. This is
highly desirable as it supersedes the laborious task of
antigen purification and ensures presentation of target
proteins in their native conformation. In a study using
antigen expressing transfectant cells to generate single
chain antibodies it was shown that cell-based selection
was far more efficient in generating Abs cross-reactive
with the native endogenous protein than selection with
purified recombinant protein [16].
The principal steps of the applied procedure are the
following: (I) generation of stably transfected mammalian cells, expressing high levels of the target antigen on
their surface in a native conformation; (II) immunisation
of mice with transfected cells; (III) hybridoma cell generation; (IV) selection of hybridoma cells by a two step
screening procedure involving an anti-IgG ELISA and
an IFA with transfected and non-transfected cells. Only
one single transfected cell line is required for the whole
process including immunisation, serum analysis, screening of hybridoma cell lines and antibody characterisation. Furthermore the very same cell line may also be
utilised for the study of receptor-ligand interactions.
In contrast to other entirely cell-based strategies to
generate monoclonal antibodies [17,18,16] our procedure used a dual tagging strategy to be able to assess
surface expression of the recombinant protein. In the
case of all three transfectants, the His tag was only
accessible upon fixation with methanol in IFA, whereas
the FLAG tag was accessible on live cells. From these
results we deduced that all three cell lines presented
recombinant protein on their cell surface. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the staining intensity with
the anti-FLAG tag and anti-His tag Ab was varying
between the three different transfectants. The finding
that transfectants showing the lowest staining with the
anti-FLAG tag Ab showed the strongest staining with

the anti-His tag Ab could indicate that the percentage
of correctly orientated protein molecules is varying
between the different transfectants. However, differences
in accessibility of the two tags in the context of the different core proteins could also be the reason for these
differences. Especially accessibility of the FLAG tag,
which is positioned between the transmembrane domain
and the parasite-derived part of the protein, could
depend on the structural features of the parasite protein
sequences.
In order to generate recombinant proteins with natural
conformation, it is most favourable to use expression
hosts of the same biological kingdom, since they likely
produce the same post-translational modifications and
recognise the same signals for synthesis, processing, and
secretion as the organism, which the sequence was originally derived from. As we were dealing with Plasmodium proteins, this objective could not be fulfilled,
because currently no Apicomplexa-based expression
system is described. Anticipating surface expression and
natural conformation, the protein encoding sequence was
genetically modified in several ways. Firstly codon-usage
was optimised for mammalian cells, as the plasmodium
genome is extremely A+T-rich. The overall (A + T)
composition is 80.6%, and rises to 90% in introns and
intergenic regions [19]. Furthermore the endogenous
GPI-attachment signal sequence was replaced by a transmembrane alpha helix of mouse glycophorin-A to ensure
C-terminal membrane anchoring despite potential phylogenetic differences in the GPI-attachment machinery
[20,21]. Whether recombinantly expressed proteins will
contain the same posttranslational modifications as the
endogenous protein was uncertain. Plasmodium species
have undergone a process of gene loss that has removed
much of their capacity to produce glycosylated proteins
other than GPI-anchored proteins [22]. Therefore recombinant expression of P. falciparum proteins in mammalian cells takes a risk of generating glycosylated forms of

the protein, which are not found in the parasite. Generated mAbs might therefore not be capable of recognising
the unglycosylated endogenous protein. However, in the
study presented here 24 out of 28 generated mAbs were
capable of recognising the endogenous protein in IFA.
Therefore potential differences in the glycosylation status
of recombinant and endogenous protein were inconsequential for antigen-antibody interactions. Beside protein
glycosylation, disulfide bonds play an important role in

the folding and stability of proteins, especially for proteins secreted to the extracellular medium. PFF0620c is
predicted to contain two s48/45 domains. These domains
are known to contain six position-conserved cysteine
residues, resulting in a conserved set of disulfide bonds
[23,24]. Generated anti-PFF0620c mAbs only reacted
with recombinant PFF0620c when analysed under nonreducing conditions, indicating that PFF0620c expressed
in HEK cells contained disulfide bridges. As 13 out of 17

Figure 7 Western blot analysis of generated monoclonal antibodies with the recombinant P. falciparum proteins. Specificity of
representative monoclonal antibodies for the corresponding recombinant proteins is demonstrated by Western-blot analysis. Reduced (A) and
non-reduced (B) protein lysates of PFF0620c- (line 1), PFD1130w- (line 2), PF14_0325-expressing HEK cells (line 3) and non-transfected HEK cells
(line 4) were probed with anti-His tag mAb, anti-PFD1130w 02 mAb, anti-PF14_0325 04 mAb and anti-PFF0620c 07 mAb, respectively.

mAbs recognised endogenous PFF0620c in IFA, disulfide
bridge formation in HEK cells is likely to have resulted in
endogenous protein-like structures.
To our knowledge, the present study shows for the first
time that antigen-expressing tranfectants of xenogenic
origin can well be used for immunisation of mice to efficiently generate antigen-specific mAbs. In the described
procedure we used a human derived cell line (HEK) for
immunisation of mice. Usage of HEK cells has the advantage that they are easy to grow, transfect very readily and
are capable of expressing large amounts of recombinant
proteins [25]. In contrast, our attempts to express the
three Plasmodium proteins in NIH/3T3 cells using a
pcDNA3.1 or a pEF6 expression vector were not successful (data not shown). One might expect that mice immunised with cells of xenogenic origin generate an excess of
antibodies against HEK cell derived antigen, thereby
repressing antibody generation specific for the parasite
proteins of interest. Indeed we saw strong antibody reactivity against HEK cells. However, this procedure generated also mAbs against the target antigens at high
frequencies (Table 1). On the other hand one could speculate that immunisation with xenogenic transfectants
possibly results in a stronger activation of the immune
system than immunisation with allogenic cells. Interestingly, the percentage of transgene-specific clones

generated in the three individual fusions correlated with
the malaria antigen expression level of the corresponding
transfected cells used for the immunisation of mice. This
indicates that high expression levels of the target antigen
are needed. It remains to be elucidated in more detail
how expression strength and cell line origin affect the
efficiency of mAb generation by this procedure. Anyhow,
our results indicate that any kind of cell line, which
expresses the antigen in decent amounts, can be used for
the generation of mAbs by the described procedure.
The two-step screening procedure consisting of an
IgG-ELISA followed by IFA of transfected cells was
quick, and the readout straightforward. In other studies
using antigen-expressing cells for immunisation and
hybridoma selection, either hybridoma supernatants
have been analysed by flow cytometry or a reporter cell
line has been used [16,26]. These screening strategies
represent alternatives to the two-step screening procedure described here. This would have the advantage that
hybridoma supernatants are screened for reactivity to
living transfectants and not against cells that had undergone a fixation processes. However, both for flow cytometric and for reporter cell analysis, antigen-expressing
cells need to be available in appropriate quality and
number over the extended and not entirely predictable
time period when hybridomas are ready for primary and

obtained from mouse bone marrow cells and cDNA generated by two-step reverse-transcription PCR using primers
designed to amplify specifically the cDNA of the transmembrane encoding region of glycophorin-A. This sequence was
then ligated to NotI digested pcDNA3.1_BVM resulting in
plasmid pcDNA3.1_BVM_GP_His. The plasmid was constructed such that unique NheI and NotI sites were preserved in the multiple cloning site. Then plasmid pUC57
containing codon optimised synthetic genes encoding P. falciparum genes PF14_0325, PFD1130W or PFF0620C
respectively that lack sequences for the secretion signal peptide and for the GPI-attachment signal peptide (Genscript),
were ligated into NotI/NheI digested pcDNA3.1_BVM_GP_His. Thereafter a double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding a FLAG tag was ligated into the NotI site resulting in
expression plasmids pcDNA3.1_BVM_PF14_0325_FLAG_GP_His, pcDNA3.1_ BVM_PFD1130W_FLAG_GP_His and pcDNA3.1_BVM_ PFF0620C_FLAG_GP_His.

the fusion and stored at -80Â°C.

Conclusions
These results demonstrate that our cell-based system of
immunisation and hybridoma selection offers a rapid and
efficient mean of obtaining mAbs reactive with the native
form of membrane-associated proteins. The strategy may
easily be extended to a wide range of cell-surface proteins.

The human embryonic kidney cell line 293 HEK was
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(CRL-1573, ATCC). 293 HEK cells were cultured in
DMEM supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum, glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin at 37Â°C in a humidified incubator.

35-mm dishes. Transfection was performed following
the manufacturerâs protocol. 3 Î¼g of expression plasmid
and 6 Î¼l transfection solution was used. Antibiotic selection was started 48 h after transfection. The selection

same antigen preparation. As soon as the animals
showed a specific immune response to the immunogen,
the best responders were boosted and after 3 days, the
spleens were removed and the isolated cells fused to
PAI myeloma cells, a variant of the P3-x63-AG8 myeloma [1,28].
Immunofluorescence staining of methanol-fixed HEK cells

HEK cells were collected using enzyme free dissociation
buffer (Cell dissociation buffer enzyme-free Hanksâbased, Gibco), washed with PBS and spotted on multiwall
glass slides (multitest slide, 12-well, 7 mm, ICN Biomedicals Inc.). When air-dried, cells were fixed in methanol
for 10 min. Immunostaining was performed by incubating the wells with 30 Î¼l of an appropriate mAb diluted in
PBS or hybridoma culture supernatant for 20 min in a
humid chamber at 37Â°C. After rinsing twice and washing
for 15 min in PBS, 30 Î¼l of 125 Î¼g/ml FITC-conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (RAM/IgG(H+L)/FITC,
Nordic Immunological Laboratories) diluted in PBS were
added to the wells and incubated for 20 min in a humid
chamber at 37Â°C. Finally, slides were rinsed twice and
washed for 15 min in PBS, mounted with mounting solution (50% PBS 50% glycerol) and covered with a coverslip. Stainings were assessed by fluorescence microscopy
on a Leica CTR500 fluorescence microscope and a Leica
DFC300 FX digital camera.
Immunofluorescence staining of living HEK cells

For immunofluorescence staining of live HEK cells
chamber slides (4-well chamber-slide, Lab-Tekâ¢, Nuncâ¢)
were used. Wells were coated with 100 mg/l poly-Dlysine in H2O in a humid box at room temperature over
night. After washing the wells three times with sterile
H2O, 40â000 cells were seeded per well. Three days later
the immunostaining was performed by incubating the
wells with 500 Î¼l of an appropriate mAb diluted in
serum-free culture medium for 30 min on ice. After
washing two times with serum-free culture medium
500 Î¼l of 100 Î¼g/ml FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse
IgG antibodies (RAM/IgG(H+L)/FITC, Nordic Immunological Laboratories) diluted in serum-free culture medium were added to the wells and incubated for 30 min
on ice. Finally, the wells were rinsed twice with serumfree culture medium and once with DâPBS (Dulbeccoâs
Phosphate-Buffered Saline containing calcium, Gibco).
The slides were mounted with mounting solution containing DAPI (ProLongÂ® Gold antifade reagent with
DAPI, Invitrogen) and covered with a coverslip. Stainings were assessed as described above.
Western Blotting analysis

HEK cells were collected using enzyme free dissociation
buffer (Cell dissociation buffer enzyme-free Hanksâ-

based, Gibco), and washed two times with PBS. To prepare cell lysate, 106 cells were lysed with 0.1 ml of lysis
buffer (1% NP40, 10% glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 137 mM
NaCl, 20 mM TrisHCl, pH8, Protease Inhibitors) for
10 min on ice. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation
at 20â000 g for 5 min.
Blood stage parasite lysates were prepared essentially
as described previously by saponin lysis of P. falciparum 3D7-infected erythrocytes [29]. In brief, cultured parasites were washed once with PBS. Pelleted
infected red blood cells were lysed by mixing with 20
volumes of 0.015% (w/v) saponin in PBS and incubated
on ice for 20 min. Finally, the pelleted parasites were
resuspended in 3 volumes of PBS and stored at -80Â°C
until further use.
For SDS-PAGE cell- or parasite lysate was resolved on
precast 4-12% gradient gels (NuPAGEÂ® Novex 4-12%
Bis-Tris Gel, Invitrogen) with MES running buffer
according to the manufacturerâs directions. The proteins
were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose
membrane using a dry-blotting system (iBlot, Invitrogen). After blocking the membrane over night in blocking buffer (5% Milk in PBS) at 4Â°C, specific proteins
were detected with appropriate dilutions of mAbs in
blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then washed four times for 5 minutes in
blocking buffer and incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse IgG mAb (GAM/IgG
(g-chain)/HRP) diluted 1:10â000 in blocking buffer at
room temperature for 1 h. After washing again, blots
were developed using ECL Western blotting detection
reagents (ECL Western Blotting Substrate, Pierce) to
visualise bands.
FACS and Flow cytometric analysis of HEK cells

For sorting stably transfected cells into high-expressing
cell pools, cells were dissociated with enzyme-free dissociation buffer (Cell dissociation buffer enzyme-free
Hanksâ-based, Gibco), washed with blocking buffer
(PBS containing 3% BSA). The cells were then incubated with 200 Î¼l of 100 Î¼g/ml FLAG-27 mAb diluted
in blocking buffer for 15 min on ice. The cells were
then washed with blocking buffer and incubated with
200 Î¼l of 100 Î¼g/ml FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse
IgG antibodies (RAM/IgG(H+L)/FITC, Nordic Immunological Laboratories) diluted in blocking buffer for
15 min on ice. After a final wash the labelled cells
were analysed and sorted using a Becton Dickinson
FACSAria running Diva software. All analyses were
performed using appropriate scatter gates to exclude
cellular debris and aggregates. Gating settings were set
to collect highly labelled cells. Post-sorting, the cells
were collected in culture medium with 20% FCS and
plated in 35 mm wells

Dreyer et al. BMC Biotechnology 2010, 10:87

For monitoring surface expression of PF14_0325,
PFD1130W or PFF0620C on transfected cell lines, cells
were stained as described above. FACS analysis was performed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson) using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). 20â000 thousand
events were collected for each sample. Untransfected
cells served as negative control. For analysing seroconversion of immunised mice, transfected cell lines were
stained using a 1:600 serum dilution in blocking buffer.
Cells were staining and analysed as described above.
Immunisation of mice

All procedures involving living animals were performed in
accordance with the Rules and Regulations for the Protection of Animal Rights (Tierschutzverordnung) of the Swiss
Bundesamt fÃ¼r VeterinÃ¤rwesen. Naval Medical Research
Institute (NMRI) mice were immunised by intravenous
injections of 106 stably transfected HEK cells. Cells were
thawed, washed and resuspended in 0.9% NaCl. Injections
were accomplished on three consecutive days and after
two weeks again on three consecutive days. Two to three
weeks after the boost, blood was collected and the serum
was tested for the presence of anti-PF14_0325, antiPFD1130W or anti-PFF0620C antibodies, respectively by
IFA and flow cytometry using stably transfected 293 HEK
cells. Mice immunised with PF14_0325-HEK cells were
boosted a second time after 4 weeks.
Fusion and cell-based selection

Animals with serum strongly reactive with expressing
cells were selected for fusion. These received a final injection of 106 cells two and one day before the fusion. Mice
were sacrificed and the spleen was removed. Spleen cells
were harvested by trituration under sterile conditions
and fused with the myeloma cell partner (PAI mouse
myeloma cells, derived from P3-x63-AG8) using polyethylene glycol 1500 (Roche Diagnostics). The fusion mix
was plated into multiwell plates and hybridomas were
selected by growing in HAT medium supplemented with
culture supernatant of mouse macrophages P388. Wells
were screened for specific IgG production between 2-3
weeks post-fusion by ELISA and IFA as described below.
Cells from wells positive in initial screens were cloned by
limiting dilution to obtain monoclonal populations.
IgG ELISA screen

Maxisorpâ¢plates (Nunc) were coated overnight at 4Â°C in
a humid box with 100 Î¼l of 5 Î¼g/ml goat anti-mouse
IgG (g-chain specific) mAb (Sigma) diluted in PBS. After
two washings with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20,
wells were blocked with blocking buffer (50 mM Tris,
140 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.05% NONidet P40,
0.25% gelatine, 1% BSA) for 1 h at 37Â°C and afterwards
washed two times. 50 Î¼l hybridoma supernatants were

Page 12 of 14

added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 37Â°C. After
washing 4 times, plates were incubated with 50 Î¼l horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (gchain specific) (Sigma) diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer
for 1 h at room-temperature in a humid box in the
dark. After washing 4 times, TMB peroxidase substrate
solution was added and the colour change monitored.
Antibody production and characterisation

Identification of antibody subclasses was performed
using a Mouse Monoclonal Antibody Isotyping Kit
(ISO2, Sigma). For large-scale mAb production hybridoma cell lines were cultured in 500 ml roller-bottles
(Corning). MAbs were purified by affinity chromatography using protein A or protein G Sepharose.
P. falciparum blood stage culture

P. falciparum strain 3d7 was cultured essentially as
described previously [29]. The culture medium was supplemented with 0.5% AlbuMAX (Gibco) as a substitute
for human serum [30]. Cultures were synchronised by
sorbitol treatment [31]. Erythrocytes for passages were
obtained from the Swiss Red Cross (Switzerland).
Immunofluorescence staining of P. falciparum

Erythrocytes from in vitro cultures of P. falciparum strain
3d7 were fixed in paraformaldehyde-glutaraldehyde as
described previously [3]. Cells were blocked by incubation
in 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h. Immunostaining was performed
by incubation with an appropriate mAb dilution in blocking solution for 1 h. After three washes with PBS, 5 Î¼g/ml
cyanine dye (Cy3)-conjugated affinity-pure F(abâ)2 fragment goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc-specific) antibodies (Jackson
Immuno Research Laboratories) diluted in blocking solution was added and incubated for 1 h at RT. Finally cells
were washed three times with PBS, mounted with mounting medium containing DAPI (ProLongÂ® Gold antifade
reagent with DAPI, Invitrogen) and covered with a coverslip. Antibody stainings were assessed as described above.
For immunfluorescence staining of sporozoites, airdried unfixed P. falciparum (strain NF54) salivary gland
sporozoites attached to microscope glass slides were
incubated with mAbs and detected with cyanine dye
(Cy3)-conjugated affinity-pure F(abâ)2 fragment goat
anti-mouse IgG (Fc-specific) antibodies (Jackson
Immuno Research Laboratories) as previously described
[32].
