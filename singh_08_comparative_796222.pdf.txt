Abstract
Background: Preparedness for a possible global pandemic caused by viruses such as the highly pathogenic
influenza A subtype H5N1 has become a global priority. In particular, it is critical to monitor the appearance of
any new emerging subtypes. Comparative phyloinformatics can be used to monitor, analyze, and possibly predict
the evolution of viruses. However, in order to utilize the full functionality of available analysis packages for largescale phyloinformatics studies, a team of computer scientists, biostatisticians and virologists is needed – a
requirement which cannot be fulfilled in many cases. Furthermore, the time complexities of many algorithms
involved leads to prohibitive runtimes on sequential computer platforms. This has so far hindered the use of
comparative phyloinformatics as a commonly applied tool in this area.
Results: In this paper the graphical-oriented workflow design system called Quascade and its efficient usage for
comparative phyloinformatics are presented. In particular, we focus on how this task can be effectively performed
in a distributed computing environment. As a proof of concept, the designed workflows are used for the
phylogenetic analysis of neuraminidase of H5N1 isolates (micro level) and influenza viruses (macro level). The
results of this paper are hence twofold. Firstly, this paper demonstrates the usefulness of a graphical user interface
system to design and execute complex distributed workflows for large-scale phyloinformatics studies of virus
genes. Secondly, the analysis of neuraminidase on different levels of complexity provides valuable insights of this
virus's tendency for geographical based clustering in the phylogenetic tree and also shows the importance of
glycan sites in its molecular evolution.
Conclusion: The current study demonstrates the efficiency and utility of workflow systems providing a biologist
friendly approach to complex biological dataset analysis using high performance computing. In particular, the utility
of the platform Quascade for deploying distributed and parallelized versions of a variety of computationally
intensive phylogenetic algorithms has been shown. Secondly, the analysis of the utilized H5N1 neuraminidase
datasets at macro and micro levels has clearly indicated a pattern of spatial clustering of the H5N1 viral isolates
based on geographical distribution rather than temporal or host range based clustering.

Background
Recent occurrences of pandemics like the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Avian Influenza clearly underscore the threat and seriousness of global diseases. The
steadily growing globalization makes it difficult to contain pandemics to a certain region. Therefore, pandemic
control is of highest importance to human health. Unfortunately, the segmented nature of the genome of influenza viruses is very conducive for genetic shifts and their
rapid spread across various genera augments genetic drift.
For example, the human influenza pandemics in 1957
and 1968 were suggested to have been caused by reassorted influenza viruses [1]. Moreover, the H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997 has convincingly demonstrated the ability of an avian virus to make the transition
from birds to humans directly without going through a
perceived "permissible host". In particular, the H5N1
virus is believed to have acquired the hemagglutinin (HA)
gene from A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 H5N1 and A/teal/
Hong Kong/W312/97 H6N1, while the internal genes
were received from A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 H2N2 or
A/teal/Hong Kong/W312/97 H6N1, respectively [2], [3].
Even though this particular strain was eliminated by culling millions of chicken, its ancestors remains circulating
in aquatic birds.
This paper proposes a new approach to pandemic control
by constantly monitoring molecular evolution at both
macro level (within the group of viruses) and micro level
(within the group of strains) using comparative phyloinformatics. This can facilitate prediction of how these
viruses are evolving in terms of spatial, temporal, and host
dimensions, and therefore, allows for faster responses to
new outbreaks as well as their diagnosis. However, corresponding phylogenetic tree construction algorithms suffer
from long runtimes due to their high degrees of computational complexity as well as the large datasets involved.
Therefore, it is necessary to develop informatics based
solutions that use suitable algorithms and take advantage
of distributed computing technologies to make such studies feasible in a reasonable amount of time. Furthermore,
these solutions need to be integrated in a framework for
pandemic control that is biologist-friendly. As a result,
effective vaccines and antivirals can be designed more easily and within a shorter response time, since specific local
strains can be targeted directly.
In this paper it is demonstrated how such a system can be
developed using a new distributed workflow design system called Quascade. As a proof of concept, results for an
actual systematic phyloinformatics analysis of neuraminidase (NA) genes of H5N1 isolates and influenza viruses
are presented. Various phylogenetic algorithms; i.e.
UPGMA, Neighbor-Joining, Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Mr. Bayes [4-7], are compared with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S1/S23

respect to their efficiency and accuracy in deriving biologically meaningful results. In particular, the presented
study illustrates how these algorithms can be integrated in
a unique user-friendly workflow in order to enhance the
efficiency of a comparative phyloinformatic analysis.
The selection of the receptor destroyer NA for this study is
motivated by its following properties. NA belongs to the
glycosyl hydrolase family of proteins and catalyzes the
cleavage of sialic acid residues from viral and cellular glycoproteins. Its most important function is to remove the
terminal sialic acids from HA in order to enable the virus
budding. Moreover, it helps the virus spreading through
the system by additionally removing sialic acids from cell
surfaces. In particular, since variations in the NA gene can
lead to the evolution of more potent strains, studying the
molecular evolution of this gene using the latest algorithms and computing power is essential.
Several isolated studies have been conducted since the
H5N1 outbreak in late 2003 to monitor the molecular
evolution at gene and genome level [8], [9]. All these studies involve a phylogenetic analysis at one level or the
other. However, no systematic efforts have been undertaken so far to evaluate the suitability of the used phylogenetic algorithms in yielding biologically meaningful
results for the analysis of HA and NA gene products of
H5N1 viruses in particular and influenza viruses in general.

Results
We have used the new Quascade system to implement distributed workflows for comparative phyloinformatics
using different algorithms. Figures 1, 2, and 3 show these
workflows for distance-based algorithms, maximum parsimony algorithms and maximum likelihood algorithms,
respectively. The workflows use ClustalW [10] to compute
multiple sequence alignments and different phylogenetic
algorithms from the PHYLIP package [4].
The most compute-intensive parts of each workflow (i.e.
ProtDist in Figure 1, ProtPars in Figure 2, and ProtML in
Figure 3) are executed in a distributed computing environment by simply multiplexing the data and using several
instances of the respective programs. Figures 4 and 5 show
execution times of the workflows for varying numbers of
processors and sequences. In summary it can be seen that
the system can achieve linear speedups.
We have used the designed workflows for the phyloinformatics analysis of NA in different populations of H5N1 in
particular and in influenza viruses in general. The reason
for choosing a protein-based phyloinformatics approach
instead of a gene-based approach is to gain a better understanding of the molecular evolution of the gene product

that makes this deadly virus spreading across different
hosts. To perform this study, three protein data sets have
been collected as follows.
1. A manual search of Swissprot [11] for NA and H5N1
has revealed only four entries: Q9WAA1 (A/Chicken/
Hong Kong/220/1997 H5N1), Q710U6 (A/Chicken/
Scotland/1959 H5N1), Q9Q0U7 (A/Goose/Guangdong/

1/1996 H5N1), and Q9W7Y7 (A/Hong Kong/156/1997
H5N1).
2. A subsequent combined and refined search of Swissprot
with TrEMBL (Translated European Molecular Biology
Laboratory) has resulted in 18 more protein sequences.
The resulting group of 22 NA sequences is used as the core
group.

obtained from the two distance-based algorithms are
shown in the additional files 6 and 7. The phylogram
obtained by Mr. Bayes [7] is displayed in Figure 6.
P18269Sial, a trypanosoan sialdase and Q05JH9H9N2, a
NA of the distantly related H9N2 virus have been used as
members of an outlier group for the phyloinformatics
analysis.
Our phyloinformatics analysis with the core set has
revealed a clear pattern: spatial clustering of the strains
based on the particular geographical region rather than
temporal clustering based on time scale or according to
host range. The obtained trees for the medium-size data
set are shown in the additional files 8, 9, and 10. The algorithms ProtPars, NJ, and UPGMA were used. All these
algorithms have been distributed using the above Quascade workflows and deployed on a cluster of PCs. The utilized cluster consists of 16 nodes comprising 32 CPUs. Its
detailed specification and architecture are shown in Table
1 and Figure 7, respectively. However, the algorithms ML
and Mr. Bayes could not be run on the existing system
with the medium dataset since it became apparent that
these algorithms require further optimization in terms of
distribution and/or more processing resources.
Finally, in order to provide a global perspective of the
molecular evolution of H5N1_NA, the dataset of 909
sequences of Influenza A viruses rather than H5N1 alone
has been utilized. The objective of this macro level analysis is to signify the fact that this approach may lead to the
nearest neighbors of some of the lethal clades which may
be kept under observation for further evolution. Again,
the large dataset was analyzed using the three algorithms
ProtPars, NJ and UPGMA. The results obtained are shown
in the additional files 11, 12, and 13. As per the core and
medium sized datasets, the macro dataset also conforms

to the clustering of H5N1_NA along the spatial lines
rather than temporal or host range lines.
Keeping the Thai clade isolates in focus while analyzing
the large dataset, the results obtained with ProtPars agree
with the trend obtained so far. All twelve core sequences
are mapped to the Thai clade. Besides these twelve, ten
more sequences were found in this clade, whereby eight of
them are fragments. The remaining two are actually complete sequences from Thailand (chicken isolates). However, they were annotated as Neuramindase instead of
Neuraminidase [12], [13] which explains why these two
entries are missing in the core set. However, querying of
Uniprot with "Influenza virus" and "NA" as query terms
has returned these two entries which are clearly captured
and validated in our phyloinformatics analysis. Zooming
out of the Thai clade has shown the Vietnam clade as its
nearest neighbor, followed further by the Indian clade
with Vietnam strains as their neighbors. On the next
higher level Indonesian, Malaysian and Chinese clades are
indicated as neighbors. It would be interesting to further
study the Indian clade and verify how closely the Indian
strains and Vietnamese strains are related with respect to

other genes and also at genome level. Such an analysis
may lead to the identification of the origin for Bird Flu in
India. Further analysis of the large dataset indicates H9N2
as the nearest clade to H5N1 and non-structural protein as
nearest to NA within the H5N1_NA group. The overall
tree includes isolates from H3N2 to H15N9. A detailed
analysis of each clade and sub-clade within this tree and
with reference to the other two trees could lead to an
understanding of H5N1's molecular evolution at global
level.

Discussion
The core set includes samples isolated over a time frame
from 1959 to 2006 and represents globally distributed
localities from Thailand to Bavaria, Germany. All the phylograms have essentially yielded geographic based clustering rather than time based clustering. The seven distinct
clades that were clearly demarcated are: Thailand clade I
(Q2L700; Q2LDC8; Q2LDC0; Q6PUP7; Q307U7;
Q45ZM8), Thailand clade II (Q5SDA6; Q307V5;

Q4PKD4), Indian clade (Q0PEF9; Q0PEG0) Scotland

A1EHP3), and China clade (Q6DTU0; Q9WAA1;
Q9Q0U7; Q9W7Y7). It is interesting to note that the host
range across these clades ranges from Chicken to Human
consisting of 16 avian hosts and six mammalian hosts.
The clustering obtained using various algorithms has not
shown any bias towards host based clustering. In fact,
Thailand clade II consisted of a chicken, a cat, a tiger and
a human. Multiple sequence alignments using ClustalW
and rendered consecutively in BioEdit [24] have revealed
the interesting and intriguing fact that the sequences of
H5N1_NA from the same strain, which have infected all
these hosts, are identical (see theadditional file 14). This
observation indicates that even though NA is critical in
spreading the virus to different hosts by means of its
receptor destroying capacity, it may not be the sole factor
for deciding the divergent host range. Accordingly a study

was undertaken to monitor the phylogenetics of another
critical protein, HA, and will be reported in a separate
communication.
Multiple alignments of all 22 sequences have revealed
another interesting fact. As can be seen from additional
file 15, the earliest (in terms of the time scale) isolates that
were considered belong to the Scotland clade which
includes two isolates from chicken isolated in 1959. Both
of them share an identical sequence homology. However,
the even more important point to note here is the existence of a 20 amino acid stretch from position 48 to 68 in
these clades which gets deleted in strains that evolved
temporally. This stretch of twenty amino acids is absent in
the isolates isolated from regions outside China and Hong
Kong from 1996 onward. Another important observation
to note is that the Goosander isolate from Guangdong

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9(Suppl 1):S23

province of China isolated in 1997 (Q9Q0U7/97)
retained the same stretch of 20 amino acids as the Scotland clades but with more than 20 point mutations spread
across the entire length. The deleted amino acid stretch
included three N-glycosylation sites: NQSI, NNTW, and
NQTY. The Chinese isolate (Q9Q0U7/97) retained all the
glycosylation sites, whereas the two Hong Kong isolates
have retained only the NQSI site but lost the other two. All
the remaining 17 isolates have lost all the three glycosylation sites. Poon et al. [14] have shown the criticality of
acquiring or losing glycan sites for effective viral spread in
a study involving the phylogenetics of glycan interactions
of the HIV envelop protein. A similar study is being undertaken by the authors of this work to evaluate the role of
"lost" glycons in H5N1_NA.
A quick perusal of the results obtained with the three algorithms (ProtPars, NJ and UPGMA) has confirmed the pattern obtained from the core set. The strains of H5N1_NA
cluster spatially rather than temporally or according to
host. However, there are subtle differences amongst the
outputs of the three algorithms with respect to their resolution. The clustering obtained using NJ seems to be better
resolved than the other two in terms of branch length and
sub-speciation. A detailed analysis of the Thai clade
obtained by ProtPars also has revealed that all the
sequences from the core set have been represented in this
tree as well. The additional isolates are mostly fragments
obtained through PCR amplification and uploaded to
Uniprot. An interesting aspect of this clade is the finding
that the entry Q5EP24 (Chicken isolate from Vietnam) is
placed almost as an outlier in this group. It would be
interesting to analyze the genealogies of Vietnam and
Thailand clades and to verify whether there are any "bridging" isolates such as Q5EP24 that may play an important
role in the spread of this deadly disease across the globe.
We have analyzed our medium dataset to confirm the pattern we obtained with the core set. A detailed analysis of
each geographic clade with respect to the "bridging" isolates such as Q5EP24 may reveal a global pattern of H5N1
spread.

Conclusion
Global preparedness for H5N1 pandemic has been
declared as the top priority of global health agencies such
as CDC. In view of the ever escalating threat of the virus
mutating to a human lethal form, it has become essential
to constantly monitor the molecular evolution of this
virus utilizing the latest and best phylogenetic algorithms.
The current study was undertaken with two objectives:
One is to demonstrate the utility of a biologist's friendly
high performance computing workflow system in analyzing large and complex biological datasets by deploying
compute intensive algorithms in their parallelized ver-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S1/S23

sion. The second objective is to analyze H5N1_NA data, as
a proof of concept, in such a workflow to understand the
molecular evolution of this rapidly evolving virus.
We have demonstrated the utility of workflow systems by
designing a pipeline that starts with data input by the biologist. Once the relevant data is uploaded into the workflow the remaining steps are all automated. In particular
these steps comprise starting with multiple alignments of
sequences to the distribution of the output to various
algorithms, distributing the relevant outputs to different
servers in a distributed environment which is grid compatible, and finally visualizing the output. Such a workflow system saves a significant amount of time and
eliminates possible human errors in analyzing critical
data.
In any phylogenetic analysis involving pathogenic viruses
there are three clear possibilities of clustering behavior:
spatial, temporal and host based. Our analysis of H5N1
NA data utilizing different phylogenetic algorithms have
indicated a spatial clustering of this virus based on geographical distribution rather than temporal or host. Of
course, single gene product analysis is insufficient to
arrive at any biologically relevant conclusion and, hence,
we propose to do multiple gene and genome level analysis
as our future work. However, even for a single gene analysis the computing power required is formidable and we
have used this approach as a proof of the concept that
high performance computing is a must for any meaningful phyloinformatics study. Even with the limited amount
of data, we have been able to find a clear pattern (geographical clustering) and the importance of glycon sites.
However, further detailed studies in conjunction with
other proteins such as HA, Polymerase etc., and also at
gene and genome level, are required to draw firm conclusions. It is also true that interpretation becomes more difficult if the size of the trees becomes very large. In our
experience, zooming onto a cluster of interest (e.g. Thailand and China clades) with relative ease and quickness,
using the Quascade middleware is an attractive feature of
our study. Furthermore, the comparison of different algorithms simultaneously with the same input file is another
attractive attribute.

Methods
Overview of Quascade-MP2
The exponential growth in the size of biological databases
has established the need for high performance computing
(HPC) in bioinformatics. Typically, an HPC setup operates in a cluster computing environment consisting of
multiple computers that communicate over fast switches.
For popular database scanning applications such as BLAST
and HMMER the benefits of clusters are immediate and
linear speedups can be easily achieved. However, the

Page 8 of 14

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9(Suppl 1):S23

evolving challenges in life sciences cannot be all
addressed by off-the-shelf bioinformatics applications.
Life scientists need to analyze their data using novel
approaches published in recent journals or based on their
own hypotheses and assumptions. Quascade-MP2 has
been developed to address this need. It is a visual prototyping tool created especially for data-driven, high performance scientific applications.
The complexity involved in using traditional technologies
and tools often proves to be over-whelming and counterproductive. Most of these tools require an understanding
of programming or scripting languages, such as Perl,
Python, Java, and UNIX-scripts. Recent examples of such
systems in bioinformatics include Biopipe [15], BioWBI
[16], Taverna [17], Wildfire[18], KDE Biosciences [19],
gRNA [20], Biowep [21], and BioWMS [22]. Each deployment is therefore subject to its own code development
and testing. Although programming languages offer
sophisticated control over the intended procedure, the
learning curve and overheads in terms of human resources
are difficult to justify. Quascade has been developed with
this problem in mind.
Quascade has been designed for research applications
characterized by strict high performance requirements. It
provides a graphical, drag-and-drop interface to allow
users to design and execute ad-hoc workflows. Workflows
are constructed by an end-user by inter-connecting functional blocks, called components. A component is a piece of
independent and self-contained code performing a given
functionality on its input and generates an output. Data
paths among components can be specified by drawing
lines between/among the output(s) and input(s) of different components, respectively. Thereby, various combinations of these components (such as one output to
multiple inputs, multiple outputs to multiple inputs) can
be used to create any workflow depicting the flow of both
data and logic.
Individual components in a workflow may be designated
to run on different computing servers in a cluster by simply specifying a corresponding condition in Quascade.
This provides a straightforward approach of constructing
workflows that execute in a high-performance environment. In turn, a component running on a given server
may use several computing nodes to execute its program,
thereby providing a two-tiered mechanism of distributed
processing. As an example, Figure 8 shows a physical
workflow and its graphical counterpart. The workflow
consists of a sample generator component, which generates/collects data, an analyzer component which performs
the actual processing, and a sample sink component which
'consumes' the processed data in terms of not forwarding
the data further to another component. While the genera-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S1/S23

tor and sink components can be connected to external
entities, i.e. physical devices, the analyzer component may
be a simple single-node program or a complex, parallel
multi-node application.
Software/Hardware setup
A typical installation of Quascade with MP2 middleware is
installed on a centrally accessible network file system
mount location, while a client uses Quascade to create
and execute a workflow. Since each component in the
workflow can be assigned to a particular MP2 server, a
straightforward implicit distribution can be achieved,
where all communication among components is managed by Quascade and MP2. Complimentary, the workload distribution of an MP2 server among its allocated
MP2 compute nodes is performed explicitly, i.e. it is the
software developer's responsibility to parallelize a component in order to enable efficient simultaneous execution
on multiple nodes.
Communication issues
The user creates a workflow by selecting workflow components from a predefined list of deployed components on
the cluster. Each component is configured to run on a particular cluster server or automatically assigned to a server
if no explicit configuration is desired. At run-time Quascade performs a remote invocation to the selected servers
and creates local instances of the used components.
Hence, client-server communication takes place between
a Quascade client and one or more instances of MP2 servers forming the cluster. Complementary, server-server
communication takes place between two or more servers
or between a server and its compute nodes.

Two different types of communication can be differentiated: explicit and implicit. They distinguish between the
workload distribution by a parallel component to multiple compute nodes and the communication between two
of more servers exchanging data, respectively. Serverserver communication uses raw sockets to transfer data
from one machine to the other. This solution provides a
performance benefit over more sophisticated alternatives
such as RMI or CORBA, but represents the lowest level of
abstraction of the underlying network. As an answer to
this trade-off, MP2 overcomes the limitations of development complexity and inflexibility by providing an abstraction at the component level supported by a fixed number
of network level operations. Thus, a developer has a high
degree of flexibility regarding the operation of a component as long as the implementation adheres to the I/O
scheme provided by the communication layer. Implicit
communication refers to the communication that takes
place between the output of one component and the
input of another component, i.e. the selected data paths
among components. The underlying transfer mechanism

Quascade-MP2 workflow
Quascade-MP2 workflow. Typical configuration for executing a Quascade-MP2 workflow

is provided by the middleware and comprises input buffers in order to enable asynchronous communication.
Input buffers are continuously polled by the corresponding component and processing continued once data is
available. An adjustable buffer length according to load
expectation helps to prevent overflows.
For example our workflow component for ClustalW
shows all the options that the original ClustalW program
presents to users. The options are presented in a parameter
output panel and translated into command line string for
calling the underlying ClustalW program upon execution
of the workflow. After the completion of ClustalW, an
output file is produced on the local hard disk at a specified
location containing the aligned data set. This file name
and its location is the input for the next component (e.g.
Seqboot). The remaining components, e.g. Seqboot with
its underlying PHYLIP operate in the same way.
For instance, Figure 9 shows a screenshot of the implemented sequential workflow for a distance based phylogenetic analysis.

The runtime of this workflow has been profiled on a single server for an input of 42 sequences and N = 100 replica. As can be seen form Figure 10, the Protdist
component clearly dominates the overall execution time
and requires parallelization.
The Seqboot component is modified to break up its output file's data into several data sets, which are written to a
buffered output port. Distribution of files is then implemented by using a demultiplexer (Demux) component
and a result combining module (Concat). More technical
details about the file distribution and concatenation as
well as other workflow parameters can be found elsewhere [23]. The model, design and implementation used
to distribute the distance-based workflow can also be
applied to parallelize the parsimony and the ML based
workflows. The usage of the model and design developed
for the Protdist component has therefore been used for
the Protpars and the ProtML components. The corresponding workflows are shown in Figure 1, 2, and 3.
