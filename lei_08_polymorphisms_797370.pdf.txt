Abstract
Background: The insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF1R) has an important effect on growth,
carcass, and meat quality traits in many species. However, few studies on associations of the IGF1R
gene with growth and carcass traits have been reported in chickens. The objectives of the present
study were to study the associations of the IGF1R gene with chicken early growth and carcass traits
using a neutral test, variation scan of the gene, genetic diversity, linkage disequilibrium and
association analyses.
Results: The tree generated from the amino acid sequences of 15 species showed that the IGF1R
gene was conservative in the whole evolution among the mammalian animals and chickens. In a total
of 10,818 bp of sequence, 70 single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in the chicken IGF1R
gene. The allelic and genotypic frequency distribution, genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium
of 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Xinghua and White Recessive Rock chickens
showed that six of them were possibly associated with growth traits. Association analyses showed
that the A17299834G SNP was significantly associated with chicken carcass body weight,
eviscerated weight with giblets, eviscerated weight, body weights at 28, 35, and 56 d of age, leg
length at 56 d of age, and daily weight gain at 0–4 weeks. The haplotypes of the A17307750G and
A17307494G were associated with early growth traits. The haplotypes of the A17299834G and
C17293932T were significantly associated with most of the early growth traits and carcass traits.
Conclusion: There were rich polymorphisms in the chicken IGF1R gene. Several SNPs associated
with chicken early growth traits and carcass traits were identified in the IGF1R gene by genetic
diversity, linkage disequilibrium, and association analyses in the present study.

Background
The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGFIR) is a
membrane glycoprotein mediating most biological
actions of IGF-1 and IGF-2, which have an important

effect on chicken growth, carcass, and meat quality traits
[1-3]. Two receptors (IGF1R and IGF2R) were found in
the mammals but only one (IGF1R) was found in the
birds. IGF1R not only regulated the half-life time and

activity of IGFs, but also played important roles on the key
developmental stage and adult stage such as the cell life
cycle, transplantation, metabolism, subsistence, proliferation, and differentiation.
Many variations in the genome affected gene expression at
the transcription and translation levels [4,5]. Variations in
the genes of somatotropic axis could function as candidates for the evaluation of their effects on animal growth
and development traits. In humans, mutations at important regulatory sites of the IGF1R gene were associated
with growth. Such mutations resulted in the failure of
processing of proIGF1R to mature IGF1R and caused dysfunction and short stature of IGFR [6-9]. These variations
affected partly the expression and physiological functions
of the IGF1R gene, and subsequently affected growth.
However, few studies on associations of the IGF1R gene
with growth and carcass traits were reported in chickens.
In the present study, the objectives were to study the associations of the IGF1R gene polymorphism with chicken
early growth and carcass traits. Polymorphisms of the
chicken IGF1R gene were scanned in a 10,818 bp of
sequence. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
used in association analyses were selected based on the
genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium analyses in
the Xinghua (XH) and White Recessive Rock (WRR) chickens. The associations of the SNPs or their haplotypes with
chicken early growth and carcass traits were analyzed in a
F2 resource population generated from a reciprocal cross
between XH and WRR chickens.

Results
The molecular evolution of the IGF1R gene
The tree generated from the amino acid sequences of 15
species showed that a positive selection was possible for
the IGF1R gene in the early evolution of the Japanese firebelly newt and Africa clawed frog, and in the middle evolution of the zebrafish, turbot, and common carp (ω > 1).
But the IGF1R gene was conservative in the whole evolution between the mammals and chickens (Figure 1).
Variations of the chicken IGF1R gene
In the present study, 10,818 bp of sequence in the IGF1R
gene, in which exon regions were preferred but segmental
introns were also included (Table 1 in Supplementary
Materials File 1), was scanned, and 70 SNPs were identified between XH and WRR chickens. Among the 70 SNPs,
7 SNPs were located in the 5' regulated region, 15 in the
coding regions, 57 in the intron regions, and 1 in the 3'
regulated region. Average density of SNPs was one SNP
per 173 bp (70/12,038) in the whole region studied, with
one SNP per 273 bp (15/4092 bp) in the coding regions,
and one SNP per 140 bp (48/6726 bp) in the intron
regions. Among the 70 SNPs, 51 SNPs are transition, 17
transversion, and 1 one base insertion/deletion. Fifteen
SNPs were found in the coding regions, but only one SNP
was non-synonymous mutation (Asn → Ser in the exon
3).
Nucleotide diversity and neutral test
The nucleotide diversity of the chicken IGF1R gene was
(2.87 ± 0.28) × 10-3, the nucleotide polymorphism was

(2.62 ± 1.06) × 10-3, and all parameters of the neutral test
were negative but not significant. For the 5' flanking
region, the nucleotide diversity of the chicken IGF1R gene
was (3.83 ± 1.62) × 10-3, the nucleotide polymorphism is
(3.01 ± 1.0) × 10-3, all parameters of the neutral test were
positive, and the values of Fu and Li's D, and F test were
significant (P < 0.05). For the intron region, the nucleotide diversity of the chicken IGF1R gene was (3.52 ±
1.49) × 10-3, the nucleotide polymorphism was (3.98 ±
0.43) × 10-3, all parameters of the neutral test were negative but not significant. For the exon region, the nucleotide diversity of the chicken IGF1R gene was (1.59 ±
0.57) × 10-3, the nucleotide polymorphism was (1.43 ±
0.32) × 10-3, and all parameters of the neutral test were
positive but not significant (Table 2 in Supplementary
Materials File 1).
Allelic frequency and heterozygosity in the XH and WRR
chickens
Between the XH and WRR chickens, the allelic frequencies
of C17393427T and A17323673G were significantly different at the P < 0.05 level and the allelic frequencies of
the 7 SNPs, C17445985T, A17417734G, C17417042G,
T17334342C,
A17327275C,
A17307494G,
and
A17299834G, were significantly different at the P < 0.01
level. No significant differences for mean heterozygosity
of the 18 SNPs were found, but significant differences of
A17313488G,
A17307750G,
A17307494G,
A17299834G, and C17293932T were observed in the XH
and WRR chickens (Table 3 in Supplementary Materials
File 1).

Association of the 6 SNPs with chicken early growth and
carcass traits
Associations of the 6 SNP with chicken early growth and
carcass traits were analyzed, but only the A17299834G of
the chicken IGF1R gene was significantly associated with
some growth and carcass traits. The A17299834G of the
chicken IGF1R gene was significantly associated with
chicken carcass weight, eviscerated weight with giblets,
eviscerated weight, body weights at 28, 35, and 56 d of
age, leg length at 56 d of age, and daily weight gain at 0–
4 weeks (P < 0.05). Significantly and suggestively dominant effects of AG genotype were observed for chicken carcass weight, eviscerated weight with giblets, breast muscle
weight, eviscerated weight, fat thickness under skin, fat
width, body weights at 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, and 77
d of age, and leg length at 42 and 56 d of age (Table 1). In
other words, the A17299834G SNP affected the chickens'
early growth.
Haplotype structure within the 6 SNP in the F2 resource
population
For the IGF1R gene, two haplotype blocks were observed
in the F2 resource population. Block 1 comprised
A17307750G and A17307494G, located between intron
17 and 18, and block 2 comprised A17299834G and
C17293932T, located between exon 20 and the 3'untranslation region (Figure 2 in Supplementary Materials File 1).

TagSNP of the IGF1R gene in the XH and WRR chickens
Eight TagSNP, C17293932T, A17299834G, A17307750G,
A17313488G, C17393427T, T17416994C, G17445596A,
and C17445985T, were identified in the XH chickens by
HapBLOCK
software.
Another
eight
TagSNP,
C17293932T, A17299834G, A17307494G, A17307750G,
T17416994C,
C17417042G,
A17417734G
and
G17445596A, were also identified as TagSNPs in the WRR
chickens.

In block 1, four haplotypes were observed in the F2 individuals of the resource population. Three distinct haplotypes, H1, H2, and H3, accounted for 95.4% of the total
number of the four haplotypes. Among the four haplotypes, allele H4 had the lowest allelic frequency of 0.46%,
and H1 had the highest allelic frequency of 51.60% (Table
5 in Supplementary Materials File 1). In block 2, four haplotypes were also observed in the F2 individuals of the
resource population. Three distinct haplotypes, E1, E2,
and E3, accounted for 96.6% of the four observed haplotypes. Among the four haplotypes, the allelic frequency of
E4 was the lowest at 0.34%, the highest allelic frequency
was 57.88% for haplotype E2.

Linkage disequilibria of the IGF1R gene in the XH and
WRR chickens
Average values of r2 showed that the linkage disequilibria
declined with increasing physical distance between SNP
pairs in the XH and WRR chickens (Figure 1 in Supplementary Materials File 1). The effective extent of linkage
disequilibrium was 27, 441 bp in the WRR chickens, but
not found in the XH chickens. Possible regions of strong
linkage disequilibrium were found between exon 6 and
the 3' untranslating region (between A17327275C and
C17293932T) in the WRR chickens (Table 4 in Supplementary Materials File 1).

Associations of the haplotypes with chicken growth and
carcass traits
Significant associations of the haplotypes of A17307750G
and A17307494G with chicken growth and carcass traits
were observed. The haplotypes of A17307750G and
A17307494G were significantly associated with body
weights at 28 and 49 d of age, and with daily weight gain
at 0–4 weeks at the P < 0.05 level, and significantly associated with body weight at 35 d of age, and leg length at
42 and 49 d of age at the P < 0.01 level. The haplotypes
composed of A17299834G and C17293932T affected the
chickens' early growth. Significantly and suggestively

In other words, the haplotypes affected the chickens' early
growth. The E1E4 diplotype was dominant for body
weights at 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 49 d of age, daily
weight gain at 0–4 weeks, carcass weight, eviscerated
weight with giblets, eviscerated weight, breast muscle
weight, brain neck weight, breast angle width, small intestines length at 90 d of age, and leg length at 56 d of age
(Table 3). Multiple comparisons showed that the E1E4
diplotype had a dominant effect in the all traits.

Discussion
A molecular phylogenetic tree generated from the amino
acid sequences of 15 species showed that the IGF1R gene
was conservative and favored subsistence in the evolution
of these species. At the same time, the ω value in the mammals and chickens proved that the IGF1R gene was conservative in the whole evolution of the mammal animals
and chickens. Analysis of evolutionary conservation had
provided insights into essential regions of molecules such
as IGF-I and their receptors, in which the tyrosine kinase
domain is highly conserved [10]. Sequence comparison
showed that the primary structures of zebrafish IGF1R
have been highly conserved in vertebrates [11]. However,
the nucleotide diversity of the chicken IGF1R gene seems
to be much higher, and chickens have a higher SNP incidence and polymorphisms.
Among the 70 SNPs, 18 SNPs were selected to study the
allelic frequencies, heterozygosity, TagSNP, and linkage
disequilibria of the XH and WRR chickens based on their
location, possible transcriptional site and the distribution
density. In 9 of the 18 SNPs, there were significant differences of allelic frequencies between the XH and WRR
chickens. These SNPs with obviously different allelic fre-

quencies between slow-growing XH and fast-growing
WRR chickens could contribute to their divergent growth
performance. Considering some associations might be
false positives, allelic frequency differences between XH
and WRR may partially provide support to the results of
the association analyses.
SNP markers were preferred for disease association studies
because of their high abundance along the human
genome, the low mutation rate, and accessibility to highthroughput genotyping. Thus, the selection of a maximally informative set of SNPs (tag SNPs) for genomewide association studies has recently attracted much
attention. In those high LD regions, only a small number
of SNPs were sufficient to capture most of haplotype structure [12]. In the present study, 8 different TagSNP were
found in the XH and WRR chickens.
The purpose of the study was to find functional SNPs by
genetic diversity, linkage disequilibrium and association
analyses of the SNPs with the economically important
traits. There were several successful examples in plants
and humans. Yu identified 6 SNPs of the rabl7 gene associated with drought tolerance in maize based on genetic
diversity and linkage disequilibrium [13]. Fu et al.
reported a systematic search for polymorphisms in the
CASQ1 gene on chromosome 1q21 and identified a significant association between the CASQ1 polymorphism
and type 2 diabete by linkage disequilibrium for the first
time [14]. Using linkage disequilibrium, some important
SNPs or QTL were found [15-17]. Morahan et al. reported
that a single base change in the 3'UTR showed a strong
linkage disequilibrium with the T1D susceptibility locus

disequilibrium region was found in the WRR chickens.
The results showed that some SNPs were linked and were
tightly scattered between the C17293932T and
A17327275C. Combining the results of the linkage disequilibrium, 6 SNPs, C17293932T, A17299834G,
A17307494G,
A17307750G,
G17445596A,
and
C17445985T, were selected and used in the association
analyses.
The results in the present study showed that the IGF1R
gene affected the chickens' early growth, which is consistent with reports on humans. Previous studies on humans
indicated that there were important associations of the
IGF1R gene with growth and development [6,7,9].
Kawashima et al. also reported that a heterozygous mutation (R709Q) changing the cleavage site from Arg-LysArg-Arg to Arg-Lys-Gln-Arg was identified in a 6-year-old
Japanese girl and the mutation resulted in the failure of
processing of the IGF1R proreceptor to mature IGF1R,
causing short stature [8]. Mutations or SNPs in the IGF1R
gene could partially affect the gene expression, and thus
could affect animal physiological metabolism and
growth. Other studies proved that the association of haplotype with economic traits was more predominant and
reliable [19-21], perhaps due to the multiple-loci interaction of the haplotype.
The chicken IGF1R gene was located on GGA10 with a
physical distance around 187 Mb, and a genetic distance
close to 100 cM. Recently, some quantitative trait loci
(QTLs) associated with growth and carcass traits were
found in the GGA10 [22,23]. Rabie et al. showed that a
single QTL related to body weight at 5 weeks under ascites
conditions was located on 82–101 cM [24]. Zhou et al.
reported that 5 QTLs were identified to be associated with
abdominal fat weight, body wight, heart weight, liver
weight, spleen weight at the 11–120 cM [25]. These studies suggest that the associations of the SNP or haplotype
with economic traits in the present study were reliable.
In conclusion, there were rich polymorphisms in the
chicken IGF1R gene. Several SNPs associated with chicken
early growth traits and carcass traits were identified in the
IGF1R gene by genetic diversity, linkage disequilibrium,
and association analyses in the present study.

Materials and methods
DNA pools
The initial SNP discovery was carried out on the DNA
pools of 7 breeds, XH chickens, Taihe Silkie chickens, Beijing Fatty chickens, Yangshan chickens, Dwarf chickens,
White Leghorn chickens, and WRR chickens. Ten individuals for each breed generated one pooled DNA sample. An
equal amount of DNA was taken from each individual
and was pooled to generate the 7 pooled DNA samples.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/70

DNA samples were diluted and reassessed to obtain an
equal amount of DNA from each individual.
A F2 resource population for association analyses
A F2 resource population was constructed by reciprocal
crossing the XH with WRR chickens [26]. The F2 individuals were raised in floor pens and fed commercial corn-soybean diets that met NRC requirements. The birds from six
batches were kept in different pens, and the sizes of all
pens were the same. The body weight was measured in
grams at hatch, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, and 90 d of
age. The 434 individuals from the F2 generations (221
male and 213 female) were slaughtered at 90 d of age.
Shank length (mm), head width (mm), breast width
(mm), breast depth (mm), body length (cm), breast angle
width (degree), carcass weight (g), fat thickness under
skin (mm), fat width (mm), eviscerated weight with giblets (g), eviscerated weight (g), breast muscle weight (g),
leg muscle weight (g), wing weight (g), abdominal fat pad
weight (g), head and neck weight (g), weights of heart,
liver, and gizzard (g), and small intestine length (cm)
were recorded.
Chicken populations for genetic diversity study and linkage
disequilibrium analyses
Two unrelated populations, consisting of 112 XH individuals and 86 WRR individuals, respectively, were sampled
for genetic diversity investigation in the present study. The
XH and WRR chickens were parents of the F2 resource
population, both from Guangdong Wens Foodstuff Corporation Ltd. (Guangdong, China). The XH chicken is a
Chinese native breed with slow growth rate, and the WRR
chicken is of fast growth rate. There is significant difference in growth and carcass traits between the XH and
WRR chickens.
Primer design for sequencing
Available sequences of the chicken IGF1R gene were used
as templates for designing specific primers by the Genetool software http://www.biologysoft.com. Twenty-two
primers were obtained and an optimal length of the PCR
product was set between 450 and 800 bp. Exon regions
were preferred, but segmental intron sequences were also
included. Details were listed in Table 1 in Supplementary
Materials File 1.
Selections of the SNPs used for genetic diversity
investigation and linkage disequilibrium analyses
For genetic diversity investigation and linkage disequilibrium analyses, 18 SNPs (Table 3 in Supplementary Materials File 1) were selected based on the following
criterions. (1) Positions: SNP in coding regions were
selected preferably over those from non-coding regions.
(2) Functional domain: SNP in the important structural
and conservative functional domains such as extracellular

Page 6 of 9

BMC Genetics 2008, 9:70

domain, joint of α subunit and β subunit, and tyrosine
kinase domain, were preferred to those in the other
domains. (3) Potential regulating units: SNP located at
the potential regulatory sites of the un-translating region
were preferred to those located at the other sites. (4) Density: An average density of 1 SNP per 8.3 kb was determined, and a total of 18 SNPs were selected in a 150 kb
full sequence of the chicken IGF1R gene.
Neutral test of the IGF1R gene
The ω value was calculated using codeml program of
PAML software [27], and formula was followed,

ω = dN/dS,
Where dN and dS are the number of non-synonymous
substitutions per non-synonymous site, and the number
of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site,
respectively. In the present study, the selection function of
the DNA sequences was analyzed in species using Branch
model of codeml program (M0 and M1), and the selection function of the amino acid was analyzed using site
model (M7 and M8) in the evolution http://taxon
omy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html.
Discovery and identification of SNPs
SNPs having different allelic frequencies in the 7 pooled
DNA samples were validated by sequencing the PCR product from both ends and by re-sequencing PCR products.
SNPs were identified by alignment of sequences using the
BioEdit program http://www.biologysoft.com. SNP calls
were made on sequences of high quality.
Amplification and Genotyping
The PCR was performed in a final volume of 25 μL containing 1 μL genomic DNA (2.5 ng/μL), 0.25 μL each
primer (25 μM), 0.5 μL deoxynucleotide triphosphates
(10 μM) mixture, 1.5 μL MgCl2 (25 mM), 0.2 μL DNA
polymerase (5 U/μL) (TaKaRa, Japan) and 2.5 μL 10 ×
reaction buffer on an ABI 2700 thermal cycle1 with the
following profile, initial denaturation at 94°C for 4 min;
35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30
s, and a final elongation at 72°C for 5 min.

Sj = min{Si_ 1 + f(i,..., j),
if block(i,..., j) = 1}(1 _ j < n),
Where f(i,..., j) is the number of tag SNPs in this block,
block(i,..., j) is a Boolean function, and block(i,..., j) = 1 if
and only if SNP (i,..., j) can form a block, Sj is the minimum number of tag SNPs for the optimal haplotype block
partition of the first j SNPs, and S0 = 0 http://
www.cmb.usc.edu/msms/HapBlock.
Statistical Analyses
The difference of allelic frequencies between the two unrelated chicken populations was tested using Mantel-Haenszel ChiSquare (SAS 8.1 FREQ).

The linkage disequilibrium r2 value between each pair of
SNPs and the haplotype structure of SNP within the gene
were estimated by Haploview [32].
Haplotypes were constructed based on haplotype structure of the 18 SNPs in all 434 experimental animals by use
of the PHASE 2.0 programme [33], whose function was to
reconstruct haplotypes from the population data.
Data were analyzed by the GLM procedure of SAS 8.0 (Statistical Analysis Systems Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and the
genetic effects were analyzed by a mixed procedure
according to the following model,
Y= μ +Si+Bj+gk+fx+eijkx
Where Y represented the dependent variable, μ, Si, Bj, gk,
fx, and eijkx represented the population mean, fixed effects
of sex, fixed effects of hatch, genotype effect, family effect,
and random error, respectively. Multiple comparisons
were analyzed with least squares means, followed by the
multiple comparison procedure, the multiple comparison
procedures was followed:
Yi − Y i = (Yi − Yi ) + (Yi − Y i )
Where
