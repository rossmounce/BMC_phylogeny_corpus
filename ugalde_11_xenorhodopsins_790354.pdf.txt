Xenorhodopsins, an enigmatic new class of
microbial rhodopsins horizontally transferred
between archaea and bacteria
Juan A Ugalde1, Sheila Podell1, Priya Narasingarao1 and Eric E Allen1,2*

Abstract
Based on unique, coherent properties of phylogenetic analysis, key amino acid substitutions and structural
modeling, we have identified a new class of unusual microbial rhodopsins related to the Anabaena sensory
rhodopsin (ASR) protein, including multiple homologs not previously recognized. We propose the name
xenorhodopsin for this class, reflecting a taxonomically diverse membership spanning five different Bacterial phyla
as well as the Euryarchaeotal class Nanohaloarchaea. The patchy phylogenetic distribution of xenorhodopsin
homologs is consistent with historical dissemination through horizontal gene transfer. Shared characteristics of
xenorhodopsin-containing microbes include the absence of flagellar motility and isolation from high light habitats.
Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Dr. Michael Galperin and Dr. Rob Knight.
Findings
Microbial rhodopsins are a widespread family of photoactive proteins found in all three domains of life. Based
on their functional roles, characterized rhodopsin proteins have been classified into three distinct groups: (i)
Proton pumps (bacteriorhodopsins and proteorhodopsins), involved in energy generation, (ii) Chloride pumps
(halorhodopsins), involved in the maintenance of osmotic balance, and (iii) Sensory rhodopsins, which direct
positive and/or negative phototaxis. Microbial proton
pumps have the widest ecological niche distribution,
and are found throughout the Bacteria and Archaea in
hypersaline, marine, and freshwater habitats [1]. Chloride pumps and sensory rhodopsins are mostly limited to
halophilic Archaea of class Halobacteria [1], excepting
the few characterized examples in the freshwater cyanobacterium Anabaena (Nostoc) sp. PCC 7120 [2,3] and
eukaryotic green algae including Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [4].
The evolutionary history of microbial rhodopsins is
complex, showing broad but patchy phylogenetic distribution within and across disparate lineages. It has been
suggested that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has

disseminated photoreceptor and photosensory activities
across large evolutionary distances [1]. One salient
example is a putative sensory rhodopsin found in the
bacterium Anabaena (Nostoc) sp. PCC 7120 (Anabaena
sensory rhodopsin, ASR). It has been suggested that this
protein was originally acquired from a halophilic
archaeon by HGT, and may play a sensory role [1,2].
However, sensory function performance has not yet
been demonstrated experimentally, and the ASR protein
differs from previously described sensory rhodopsins in:
(i) a distinct signaling cascade mechanism that employs
a soluble transducer protein, rather than the methylaccepting taxis transducers (HTR proteins) found in
halophilic Archaea [2,5] and (ii) its divergent photochemistry, including unique light-induced cis/trans configuration dynamics of the retinal chromophore,
providing a possible mechanism for sensing and differentiating specific light qualities [3,6].
In the current study, we report the discovery of several new ASR protein homologs with shared characteristics consistent with the designation of a new class of
microbial rhodopsins. ASR homologs were found in
Nanosalina sp. J07AB43 and Nanosalinarum sp.
J07AB56, the first representatives of a newly described
major lineage of Archaea (class Nanohaloarchaea) within
phylum Euryarchaeota [7]. The Nanosalina sp. and
Nanosalinarum sp. rhodopsin proteins are highly similar

protein sequences from all previously recognized functional microbial rhodopsin classes. Methods and experimental procedures are provided in Additional File 1.
The phylogenetic tree also includes additional sequences
we obtained by PCR amplification using primers specifically targeting Nanohaloarchaeal rhodopsin genes. These
sequences were recovered from a hypersaline environment (South Bay Salt Works, Chula Vista, California,
USA) that is geographically distant from the original isolation site of the Nanohaloarchaea genomes (Lake Tyrrell, Victoria, Australia). Tree topology shows robust
clustering of all ASR homologs as a single clade, distinct
from other rhodopsin types. We propose the name
“xenorhodopsins” to describe this class of rhodopsin
proteins, articulating the wide taxonomic diversity of its
members.
The patchy distribution and topology of the xenorhodopsin clade is consistent with HGT events between

to each other (89% amino acid identity) and are present
in both genomes as single copy genes. Surprisingly,
these two Nanohaloarchaeal proteins most closely
resemble rhodopsins in taxonomically distant Cyanothece sp. PCC 7424 and Anabaena (Nostoc) sp. PCC
7120, at 31 and 34% amino acid identity respectively.
No homologs were identified in other members of the
Euryarchaeota, although related proteins were detected
at 30-31% amino acid identity in Bacillus coahuilensis
m4-4 (phylum Firmicutes), a sporulating halophilic bacterium isolated from a desiccation lagoon [8], the psychrophilic bacterium Hymenobacter roseosalivarius AA718 (phylum Bacteroidetes), and the halophilic bacterium Haloplasma contractile SSD-17B (phylum Tenericutes) [9,10].

domains and involving five disparate bacterial phyla.
The large numbers of currently sequenced Firmicute
(873), Bacteriodetes (169), Cyanobacteria (68), and
Haloarchaea genomes (18) lacking xenorhodopsin
homologs make it unlikely that the gene/species tree
incongruencies shown in Figure 1 could be explained by
independent gene loss among multiple species. Sufficiency of taxon sampling and information content in
our 205-position trimmed amino acid sequence alignment (Supplementary File 2) are well supported by significant bootstrap values (Figure 1), and corroborated by
complete topological agreement between trees constructed using Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods. Additionally, the new xenorhodopsin sequences
identified here do not change overall tree topologies of
other microbial rhodopsin sequences previously reported
in the literature [11].
To supplement HGT analysis based on phylogenetic
incongruencies, DNA signature patterns were analyzed
for individual xenorhodopsin proteins relative to the
genomes in which they were found, based on percent G
+C, codon usage patterns, and Interpolated Variable
Order Motifs [12] (Additional File 1: Table S1). By all of
these criteria, xenorhodopsin genes in Nanosalinarum
J07AB56, Cyanothece PCC 7424, Nostoc PCC 7120,
Hymenobacter roseosalivarius, and Haloplasma contractile closely resemble other loci within their respective
genomes. These data support the likelihood that the
observed incongruencies between xenorhodopsin protein
and species trees for these genomes represent ancient
rather than recent HGT events, with subsequent amelioration of foreign DNA signatures over time. A different
pattern was observed for xenorhodopsin proteins in the
Bacillus coahuilensis and Nanosalina J07AB43 genomes,
where atypical codon usage suggests that HGT events
may have occurred more recently (Additional File 1:
Table S1).
The absence of xenorhodopsin genes in all Euryarchaeaota other than members of class Nanohaloarchaea
suggests that these genes were acquired subsequent to
divergence of Nanohaloarchaeaota from other Euryarchaeotal classes. The high degree of similarity among
xenorhodopsin proteins obtained from two different
Nanohalorchaeal genera, as well as environmental
sequences from a distant geographical location (North
America versus Australia), is consistent with inheritance
from a common ancestral source, coupled with strong
selective pressure for amino acid sequence conservation.
The discrepancy between ancestral inheritance and the
atypical codon usage pattern observed in the Nanosalina
J07AB43 protein may be explained by relatively recent
secondary exchange with other Nanohaloarchaea, as
multiple genera of this lineage are known to coexist in
shared habitats [7].

The phylogenetic tree presented in Figure 1 includes
only known, modern representatives of lineages that
may have incorporated multiple HGT events between
extinct ancestors and/or serial exchanges with unknown
species whose genomes have not yet been sequenced.
Although the complexity of these relationships precludes
confident reconstruction of the exact timing, direction,
and order of individual gene transfer events, crossdomain and cross-phylum gene acquisition through
HGT provides the most parsimonious explanation for
the data.
Amino acid alignments of residues known to determine function for previously characterized microbial
rhodopsins are inconsistent with proton or chloride
transporting activity for xenorhodopsins, suggesting a
possible sensory role (see Additional File 2 for full alignment). Figure 2 shows that residues required to bind the
retinal chromophore molecule are conserved across all
xenorhodopsin group members. Ion transporting rhodopsins can be distinguished from sensory rhodopsins
by comparing the residues that serve as the retinal Schiff
base proton donor and proton acceptor during the
photocycle [2,13]. These residues correspond to Asp98
(acceptor) and Asp109 (donor) in the H. salinarum bacteriorhodopsin (Helix C). Consistent with previously
described sensory rhodopsins, ASR and all other xenorhodopsin homologs lack the canonical Asp residue at
the donor position, a hallmark of proton translocating
rhodopsins. Likewise, known sensory rhodopsins and
xenorhodopsins both lack the Thr (acceptor) and Ala
(donor) configuration diagnostic of chloride pumps (Figure 2).
Despite the insights provided by these results, it is not
possible to predict functional activity based on sequence
alignment alone. The structural sensitivity of microbial
rhodopsins is highlighted by the ability to engineer aberrant functional properties in these proteins. A single
amino acid substitution, Asp217 to Glu, has been shown
to confer inward proton pumping activity to the ASR
protein [14] and a single amino acid substitution is sufficient to convert a bacteriorhodopsin proton pump into
a chloride pump [15].
One prominent difference between the xenorhodopsins and all other microbial rhodopsin proteins is a universal Pro to Asp substitution (Helix G), a substitution
noted previously in the Anabaena (Nostoc) sp. PCC
7120 and B. coahuilensis homologs [8,16]. The shared
position of this residue in all xenorhodopsins discovered
to date suggests that it may provide a useful diagnostic
for this protein class.
Sequence conservation and phylogenetic analysis of
xenorhodopsin proteins is strongly supported by comparative 3-dimensional protein structure modeling. This
similarity is illustrated in Additional File 3, showing a

rhodopsin structure using ASR as a template. The modeled structure demonstrates high congruence in residues
that form the retinal binding pocket, as well as similar
truncations in loop motifs (Additional File 3). The conserved primary and tertiary structure of xenorhodopsins
combined with their distinct phylogenetic clustering
supports their classification as a coherent, highly conserved group.

An important element of previously characterized sensory rhodopsins in halophilic Archaea is the presence of
a signal transduction mechanism, most often genetically
encoded in a genomic position adjacent to the rhodopsin gene [18]. In Anabaena (Nostoc) sp. PCC 7120, the
proposed soluble transducer protein ASRT (Anabaena
sensory rhodopsin transducer) is encoded by a gene in
the same operon as ASR [18] (Figure 3). Consistent with
its putative role in light-activated sensory transduction,

the ASRT protein has been shown to bind DNA, specifically the promoter region of genes involved in the
synthesis of light-harvesting accessory pigments [19].
However, no homologs of ASRT were identified in other
genomes containing a xenorhodopsin gene, suggesting
the ASR-ASRT association is a specific feature of Anabaena (Nostoc) sp. PCC 7120. Moreover, the identification of ASRT homologs in numerous bacterial and
archaeal genomes that lack an ASR (xenorhodopsin)
homolog suggests the ASRT protein family is not specific to photosensory signal transduction processes.
The lack of identifiable common transducer elements
suggests possible plasticity in the transducer component

(s) modulating possible xenorhodopsin-mediated photosensory activity. For example, Cyanothece sp. PCC 7424
has genes encoding a two-component regulatory system
within the same genomic neighborhood as the xenorhodopsin gene (Figure 3). The two Nanohaloarcheal genomes (Nanosalina sp. and Nanosalinarum sp.) have
genes encoding a putative Na + /H + antiporter system
adjacent to the rhodopsin gene. The high sequence
identity shared between these transporter sequences
along with their conserved genomic location is atypical
for these two archaeal genomes, representing different
genera, which are generally non-syntenic [7]. It is tempting to speculate that genes in this local region of

Ugalde et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:52
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/52

conservation could be related to rhodopsin function in
these organisms.
Despite highly diverse taxonomic origins, the seven
species possessing a xenorhodopsin protein share a
number of common characteristics, including the
absence of flagellar motility, relatively low genomic
percent G+C content and isolation from habitats with
a high incidence of UV light (Additional File 1: Table
S2). The lack of flagellar motility is noteworthy
because it eliminates the potential usefulness of previously characterized sensory rhodopsin classes which
act by influencing the rotational state of the flagellar
motor for phototaxis. The particularly low G+C compositions of Nanosalina sp. (43%), Anabaena (Nostoc)
sp. PCC 7120 (41%), Cyanothece sp. PCC 7424 (38%),
Bacillus coahuilensis (38%) and H. contractile (33.6%)
are atypical for unicellular inhabitants of high light
environments, rendering them especially sensitive to
potential UV damage via the formation of thymidine
dimers. The isolation of H. contractile from deep marine sediments, where light is not a factor, may be an
anomaly, since closely related 16S rRNA gene
sequences have also been found in high-light solar saltern environments [9].
Consistent with these observations, one intriguing
hypothesis is that xenorhodopsins may play a role in
pre-emptive photoprotection by inducing light-dependent changes in the expression of photoprotective pigments, a role proposed for the ASR protein due to its
photochromic properties [3,6]. Alternatively, these proteins could be linked to expression of DNA repair
mechanisms. However, these speculations must be tempered by the caveat that no sensory or ion transport
function has yet been experimentally validated for ASR,
or any other xenohodopsin protein. Future work on the
biochemistry, photochemistry, and molecular genetic
characterization of the xenorhodopsin class of proteins
will undoubtedly provide fascinating insights into their
physiological function in light-induced biological
processes.

I agree with the authors’ conclusion that Anabaena
sensory rhodopsin (ASR) and closely related proteins
form a separate family of rhodopsins. However, I believe
that the current version of the paper would need a substantial revision to become acceptable for Biology
Direct.
The notion that ASR comprises a new type of sensory
rhodopsins is not new and should not be presented as

Page 6 of 8

such. Spudich and colleagues described the uniqueness
of ASR in their early papers [2,16] and unequivocally
stated that ASR belongs to a separate family [6]. This
does not diminish the contribution of this work, which
describes six new members of that family, but the text
of the Abstract and the tone of the whole paper must
be changed.
Author’s response

We thank the reviewer for bringing to our attention
these deficiencies in our original summary of previous
work recognizing the uniqueness of the ASR protein. We
have modified the manuscript to address these issues
by changing the title, the abstract, and the interpretational emphasis of our text. We believe these revisions
clarify the significance of our findings in discovering
that the ASR protein is not a single, isolated anomaly,
but rather part of a large, cohesive family of related
proteins with an unusual taxonomic distribution. To
further emphasize this point, we propose the name
“xenorhodopsin” to describe the members of this group,
rather than calling them ASR-like (or Sensory Rhodopsin-IV) proteins.
Although the name “Anabaena sensory rhodopsin” is
being widely used in the literature, it is important to
note that there has been no experimental proof that this
protein actually performs sensory function. Indeed, ASR
has been shown not to function as a proton pump and
it has been reasoned that it is unlikely to work as a
chloride pump. Nevertheless, there remains a distinct
possibility that ASR functions as a membrane pump for
some other ion, for example, sodium. This proposal is
hardly more speculative than the suggestion of the sensory function and is supported by at least three lines of
evidence:
1) the adjacency of genes coding for ASR homologs
and Na + /H + antiporters, noted by the authors
themselves.
2) the observation of Kawanabe et al. [14] that a single
amino acid change converts ASR into an inward proton
pump; and 3) the observation of De Souza et al. [20]
that so-called ASR transducer is found in a variety of
genomes that do not encode ASR and is likely to bind
sugars. Further, the previously overlooked absence of
the ASRT gene in the complete genome of Cyanothece
sp. PCC7424 and its recently reported ability to bind
DNA [19] strongly suggest that the putative ASR-ASRT
signaling cascade is a specific feature of Anabaena sp.
PCC7120. The authors correctly point out the absence
of flagellar motility in the ASR-carrying organisms; this
argument, however, is weakened by the chemotactic
ability of both Anabaena sp. PCC7120 and Cyanothece
sp. PCC7424, owing to the presence of 3 and 9 methylaccepting chemotaxis sensors, respectively [21]. In the
absence of direct experimental data, the authors should

Ugalde et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:52
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/52

discuss possible alternative functions of the ASR-like
family and should be more careful in describing this
new rhodopsin family as sensory rhodopsins.

Author’s response

Although many methods of HGT detection have been
proposed in the literature, their lack of consistency and
potential unreliability in the face of complex, real world
data have long been a matter of controversy and debate.
Phylogenetic tree incongruency is currently considered
the gold standard by which all other HGT prediction
methods are judged, and this is the primary technique
we have used to reach conclusions presented in the
manuscript, which we believe are compelling.
To supplement the phylogenetic analyses, we have performed several additional HGT analyses using methods
based on DNA signature patterns, included these results
as Supplementary Table S1, and expanded discussion of
HGT in the text to include interpretation of these additional results.

The previously presented Supplementary Figure S1 is
now Figure 3in the main text.

Author’s response

We have expanded the text to include a discussion of
possible alternative functions for the xenorhodopsin
family, including how lack of experimental evidence for
ASR sensory function affects interpretation of conserved
amino acid sequences, the importance of mutational
experiments demonstrating gain of inward proton pumping function, and the apparent species-specific nature of
the ASR/ASRT interactions.
I would also suggest moving the Supplementary Figure
S1 (Genomic neighborhood of SR-IV genes) to the main
text.

In this manuscript, the authors analyze a set of
microbial rhodopsin sequences (including some that
they amplified for this study from an environmental
sample), and demonstrate that there is a new clade of
sensory rhodopsins that is basal, with high bootstrap
support, and that includes sequences from a surprisingly broad phylogenetic range (including one archaeal
and three bacterial phyla). This distribution is interesting because previous studies of sensory rhodopsins
have found them primarily in the Euryarchaeota and in
the Bacteroidetes.
The methods are generally sound except that the taxonomy of the sister groups to the new clade is poorly
resolved (i.e. non-significant bootstraps), and it would
be reassuring if the split were confirmed using other
phylogenetic methods besides likelihood (e.g. distance or
Bayesian methods) before the new set of sequences was
claimed as distinct.

Author’s response

We have supplemented our original phylogenetic analysis
with Bayesian and distance-based methods, and find
that all agree in supporting identical tree topologies. We
have revised Figure 1and the text to clarify the fact that
the topologies agree and that bootstrap values supporting
branches relevant to the new clade are highly significant
using all methods.
Additionally, although the patchy phylogenetic distribution is suggestive of horizontal gene transfer, formal
methods (of which several exist) should be used to confirm HGT as opposed to other factors that can lead to
gene/species tree incongruence
