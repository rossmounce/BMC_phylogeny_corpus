Abstract
Background: One of Darwin's chosen examples for his idea of sexual selection through female
choice was the "sword", a colourful extension of the caudal fin of male swordtails of the genus
Xiphophorus. Platyfish, also members of the genus Xiphophorus, are thought to have arisen from
within the swordtails, but have secondarily lost the ability to develop a sword. The sustained
increase of testosterone during sexual maturation initiates sword development in male swordtails.
Addition of testosterone also induces sword-like fin extensions in some platyfish species, suggesting
that the genetic interactions required for sword development may be dormant, rather than lost,
within platyfish. Despite considerable interest in the evolution of the sword from a behavioural or
evolutionary point of view, little is known about the developmental changes that resulted in the
gain and secondary loss of the sword. Up-regulation of msxC had been shown to characterize the
development of both swords and the gonopodium, a modified anal fin that serves as an intromittent
organ, and prompted investigations of the regulatory mechanisms that control msxC and sword
growth.
Results: By comparing both development and regeneration of caudal fins in swordtails and
platyfish, we show that fgfr1 is strongly up-regulated in developing and regenerating sword and
gonopodial rays. Characterization of the fin overgrowth mutant brushtail in a platyfish background
confirmed that fin regeneration rates are correlated with the expression levels of fgfr1 and msxC.
Moreover, brushtail re-awakens the dormant mechanisms of sword development in platyfish and
activates fgfr1/msxC-signalling. Although both genes are co-expressed in scleroblasts, expression of
msxC in the distal blastema may be independent of fgfr1. Known regulators of Fgf-signalling in
teleost fins, fgf20a and fgf24, are transiently expressed only during regeneration and thus not likely
to be required in developing swords.
Conclusion: Our data suggest that Fgf-signalling is involved upstream of msxC in the development
of the sword and gonopodium in male swordtails. Activation of a gene regulatory network that
includes fgfr1 and msxC is positively correlated with fin ray growth rates and can be re-activated in
platyfish to form small sword-like fin extensions. These findings point towards a disruption between
the fgfr1/msxC network and its regulation by testosterone as a likely developmental cause for
sword-loss in platyfish.

Background
Charles Darwin conceived not only the theory of natural
selection, but also recognized that a theory of sexual selection is necessary to explain the presence of conspicuous
traits in male animals that could not have arisen by natural selection [1]. A number of studies provided evidence
that sexual selection increases taxonomic diversity,
although it remains somewhat controversial if and how
sexual selection alone can cause speciation (reviewed in
[2,3]). The body of theory about sexual selection has been
extended through several new insights that explain the
evolution of sexually selected traits and mating behaviour.
Fishes of the genus Xiphophorus are a popular model in
which various aspects of sexual selection have been studied extensively (reviewed in [4]). The most prominent sexually selected trait in male swordtail fish of the genus is
the sword, a conspicuously pigmented elongation of the
ventral caudal fin. The sword consists of several components, i.e. a ventral fin elongation and a characteristic pigmentation pattern [5,6]. In the green swordtail X. helleri,
it consists of centrally located yellow-orange or green coloured rays, that are flanked dorsally and ventrally by rays
with strong melanisation (Figure 1A, B and [7]). Both
length and colouration are important for mating success
[7,8].
The evolutionary history of the sword is of particular
interest. One scenario, supported by molecular phylogenies, suggests that all extant Xiphophorus species, swordtails and sword-less platyfish, descended from a common,
sworded ancestor [5,9,10]. Moreover, short extensions of
the ventral portion of the caudal fin are also phylogenetically widespread and, for example, are found in Poecilia
petenensis [11]. Platyfish (Figure 1C), a common name
that is used to describe several swordless species that
belong to a monophyletic clade within the genus Xiphophorus, however, secondarily lost their sword during evolution, possibly because the costs in terms of natural
selection were higher than the gain in terms of sexual
selection. Nonetheless, females of some platy species in
which this has been tested still prefer sworded males over
the swordless males of their own species [12,13]. The preference for elongated caudal fins seems to be much older
than the trait itself, since it is also present in at least one
species of the sister genus Priapella [14]. Therefore, the
sword is thought to have evolved in response to a preexisting female bias, such as a general preference for the
apparent size [8,12]. Due to this interesting evolutionary
history, the sword presents a valuable model to study how
evolution acts at the molecular level to generate or abolish
a sexually selected trait. This objective has also driven
research in other animals, e.g. the colour morphs in males
of the livebearing fish Poecilia parae [15], the exaggerated
hypercephaly in stalk-eyed flies [16], or the horns of dung
beetles [17]. All of these are examples of model systems in

which the basis of change in male exaggerated traits under
sexual selection is amenable to genetic dissection.
One way to address this question in swordtails is to dissect
the genetic pathways that might be involved in the development of the sword and to characterize these within a
phylogenetic framework of the entire genus that involves
swordtails and platyfish. So far, only little is known about
the molecular basis of sword development. Hybridisation
experiments between X. helleri and X. cortezi revealed that
multiple genes control sword development, which were
collectively termed "sword genes" ("Schwertgene"), i.e.
genes or alleles that confer an ability to produce a sword
in hybrids of platyfish and swordtails [18]. In addition, fin
ray transplantation experiments have shown that sword
rays are characterized by the possession of an organizing

activity that induces neighbouring fin rays to contribute to
the sword [19]. Sword-induction experiments with juvenile swordtails, treated with exogenous testosterone,
revealed that testosterone is a sufficient and essential factor that induces sword development [20,21]. Exogenous
testosterone also induces the development of the gonopodium (Figure 1B), a modified anal fin used as a copulation organ that is common to all fish in the family
Poeciliidae (the livebearing toothcarps). This might suggest that androgen signalling regulates a molecular pathway that induces both sword and gonopodium
development. Interestingly, some platy species develop a
small ventral extension of the caudal fin through testosterone treatment [20-22], suggesting that the genetic
machinery underlying sword development is still partly
intact even in normally swordless platyfishes. Most likely,
this machinery has never been lost completely, even
though it might have been inactive for more than a million years [9,10].
Genes that regulate growth-dependent processes like fin
regeneration are good candidates for genes involved in
sword development. A candidate gene approach revealed
msxC (muscle segment homeobox gene C), a gene known to
act in fin regeneration, to be specifically up-regulated in
developing swords and gonopodia [23]. By combining
available genetic and phylogenetic data, it was hypothesized that genes and pathways that shape the evolutionarily older gonopodium have been partly adapted for sword
development [23].
Other putative candidate genes for sword development
are upstream regulators of msxC, such as components of
the Fgf (Fibroblast growth factor) signalling pathway. Fgf
signalling controls epithelial-mesenchymal interactions
in the external genital anlagen of mammalian embryos
[24]. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (Fgfr1) appears
to regulate msxC and msxB expression during caudal fin
regeneration in zebrafish and is required for regenerative
outgrowth of fin rays [25,26]. Furthermore, Fgf ligands
such as those encoded by the fgf24 and fgf20a genes have
been shown to play a role in caudal fin regeneration or
pectoral fin development [27,28]. To test a putative role of
Fgf-signalling in sword development we cloned the fgf
receptor 1 and two fgf orthologs, fgf24 and fgf20a, from the
swordtail X. helleri and analysed their expression pattern
in developing swords and gonopodia as well as regenerating swords. From a developmental point of view, we
asked whether regulation of fgf genes expression is associated with growth of the sword and gonopodium during
development and sword regeneration. From an evolutionary standpoint, we were interested in evaluating whether
potential differences in fgf gene expression between
swordtails and platy species contribute to the understanding of the molecular changes that led to the loss of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/98

sword during evolution. Furthermore, we analysed the
expression of fgfr1 and msxC in regenerating caudal fins in
the platyfish X. maculatus fin overgrowth mutant brushtail,
where medial rays of the caudal fin continue to grow
throughout the entire life of the animal (Figure 1D). We
show that genes are regulated similarly in regenerating
sword rays and elongated brush rays, although sword
regeneration proceeds differently from regeneration in
brushtail.

Results
Cloning and analysis of fgf genes
Since sword development in X. helleri requires the growth
of caudal fin rays, genes that act to regulate growth in the
regenerating zebrafish caudal fin appeared to be suitable
candidate genes that may also be involved in sword development. Up-regulation of fgfr1 and msx gene expression
has originally been observed in the blastema during
zebrafish fin regeneration [25], and it had subsequently
been shown that inhibition of Fgf signaling during ongoing fin regeneration prevents further outgrowth and
down-regulates the established expression of blastemal
msx genes [25,26,29,30]. fgf24 and fgf20a encode putative
Fgfr1 ligands that are expressed or fulfill important functions in zebrafish fin regeneration [25,28]. To clone the
Xiphophorus orthologs from the green swordtail, Xiphophorus helleri, we used a RT-PCR strategy and caudal fin blastemata as source for mRNA. The amplified fragment of the
fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (EU340805) covers
1248 bp of the protein's open reading frame, including
parts of the IG Domain II, the complete IG Domain III
and parts of the tyrosine kinase domain (see Figure A and
B in Additional file 1), found in vertebrate Fgfr1 [31]. Phylogenetic reconstruction of the fgf receptor family, using
coding sequence, confirmed that we cloned a partial
sequence of the X. helleri Fgfr1 ortholog (Figure 2A).

The two cloned cDNA fragments of fgf24 include the complete coding sequence of fgf24, parts of the 5'UTR and the
whole 3'UTR sequence. The 633 bp ORF (EU340806) of
X. helleri fgf24 codes for a 210 amino acid protein with a
heparin-binding growth factors/fibroblast growth factor
(HBGF/FGF) family signature (see Figure A and B in Additional file 2). Phylogenetic analysis of the 633 bp cDNA
sequence verified the sequence to be the X. helleri fgf24
ortholog (Figure 2B).
In addition we cloned two cDNA fragments of fgf20a, that
together cover most of the coding and the complete 3'UTR
sequence. The partial protein sequence, coded by 663 bp
(EU340807), shows a conserved HBGF/FGF motif (see
Figure A and B in Additional file 2). Interestingly, there is
a QH-rich (aa 22–55) motif close the N-terminus of the
sequence (see Figure A in Additional file 2). This motif
could not be found in Fgf20a sequences of other verte-

(Figure 2C).
fgfr1 and msxC are differently regulated in caudal fins of
maturing swordails and platyfish
In order to test whether Fgf-signalling is involved in sword
development of the green swordtail, X. helleri (Figure 1A),
we treated 4–5 month old juvenile fish with 17-α-methyltestosterone to artificially induce this process. To allow
both for the simultaneous generation of large numbers of
experimental animals and for timed induction of sword
development we prematurely induced swords in juvenile
fish. Importantly, hormonally induced swords in immature juveniles do not show any sex-related morphological
differences [18,21]. Even adult females develop a sword
under testosterone treatment that is indistinguishable
from the male sword both in length and pigmentation
[18], therefore the sex of the individual should not bias
the downstream analysis.

In developing swords, fgfr1 expression was first observed
after 4 days of hormone treatment (dt), when black pigmentation along the dorsal border of the sword also
becomes visible (data not shown). After 5 dt, when the
outgrowth of sword rays had started, fgfr1 was mainly upregulated in the distal tip of the main ventral sword-forming fin rays V7–V10 (Figure 1B and [21]) compared to
median or dorsal rays (Figure 3A). However, fgfr1 was
expressed much more strongly in V7–V9 than in V10 (Figure 3A). A slight up-regulation of fgfr1 was also detected
in ray V6 (Figure 3A). Importantly, this pattern is comparable to that of msxC a gene that is strongly up-regulated
in developing swords (Figure 3B and [23]). Up-regulation
of fgfr1 was not observed in control fins (Figure 3C). This
overlap in expression pattern of fgfr1 and msxC persists
during later stages of sword outgrowth (compare Figures
3D–F and 3G–I). These finding suggest that high levels of
fgfr1 expression correlate with the development of ventral
caudal fin rays into swords. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal overlap of both fgfr1 and msxC expression patterns
indicate a likely interaction of these genes during sword
development.
To test if changes in the regulation of fgfr1 and msxC are
linked to the absence of the sword in platyfish, we assayed
the expression of both genes in the caudal fin of the platyfish X. maculatus (Figure 1C) after 5 and 10 days of testosterone treatment. The expression of both genes in caudal
fins at 5 dt differs clearly between X. helleri and X. maculatus. In X. maculatus both genes are uniformly expressed
with no differences between sword and non-sword rays
(Figures 3J and 3K). In addition, the expression patterns
of both genes in testosterone treated fins are quite similar
to those of control fins (Figure 3L). At 10 dt however, both

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/98

genes are up-regulated in a subset of ventral fin rays (Figures 3M–O and not shown). This expression pattern is
likely to mark the fin rays that will form a small caudal
extension under high exogenous levels of testosterone
[20,22]. Based on the expression data, we conclude that
loss of sword ray specific regulation of fgfr1 or msxC could
have been involved in the secondary loss of this trait in
platyfish.
fgfr1 and msxC regulation in maturing anal fins is
conserved between swordtails and platyfish
Males of both platyfish and swordtails as juveniles possess
typical anal fins, that during sexual maturation transform
into a gonopodium, an intromittent organ for internal fertilisation [32]. Despite some differences in gonopodium
morphology between species, all gonopodia are formed
by anal fin rays 3–5 that develop into a structure that can
deliver sperm into the females genital tract as well as
scrape out sperm of other males through hooks that are
formed by modification of fin ray elements (Figure 1B and
[32,33]). We expected that gonopodia of both swordtails
and platyfish show a similar spatio-temporal pattern of
fgfr1 and msxC expression. Because it was impractical to
identify sufficient numbers of normally developing male
juvenile fish at the desired stages, we analysed the expression patterns of both genes in artificially induced gonopodia of the swordtail X. helleri and the platyfish X.
maculatus.

At 5 days of testosterone treatment, strong expression of
fgfr1 was found in the distal part of the main gonopodial
rays 3, 4 and 5, the so-called 3–4–5 complex [34] of X. helleri (Figure 4A). Because gene expression in deeper layers
of fin rays may be shielded from detection during whole
mount in situ hybridisation [35], we performed in situ
hybridisation on longitudinal sections which reveal
strongest expression of fgfr1 in mesenchymal cells at the
tip of growing gonopodial rays (Figure 4B). This pattern
persists during later stages of gonopodium development
(Figure 4C). In addition, fgfr1 is up-regulated in the interray tissue (Figures 4A and 4C).
As in developing swords, the spatio-temporal expression
pattern of fgfr1 is similar to that of msxC, which is up-regulated in the mesenchyme of gonopodial rays 3 to 5 and
in interray tissue (Figures 4D–F). Both genes are not upregulated in untreated fins (Figure 4G).
The spatio-temporal expression pattern of fgfr1 and msxC
in developing gonopodia of the platyfish X. maculatus
approximately resembles the pattern found in X. helleri.
Both genes are up-regulated in the distal part of the
gonopodial rays 3, 4 and 5 and in the interray tissue (Figures 4H, I, J, K) compared to control fins (Figure 4L). The
different shapes of the distal fin ray tips in X. maculatus

Expression of fgfr1 and msxC in the developing sword
Figure 3
Expression of fgfr1 and msxC in the developing sword. X. helleri fgfr1 is up-regulated during sword development. When
maturation is induced by exogenous testosterone, fgfr1 is up-regulated in the ventral-most caudal fin rays in developing swords
at 5 and 10 days of treatment (dt)(A, F). Weaker expression of fgfr1 can also be detected in non-sword rays (A, D, E). fgfr1 is
not up-regulated in untreated control fins (C). fgfr1 expression overlaps with msxC, which is also up-regulated in developing
sword rays ([23], B and I). In later stages of treatment, up-regulation of both genes in the distal part of the dorsal-most rays is
observed in some individuals (G), which may develop a small "upper sword" ([20]). Like fgfr1, msxC expression is also detected
in non-sword rays (G, H). When maturation is induced by exogenous testosterone in the platyfish, X. maculatus fgfr1 and msxC
are similarly expressed in all caudal fin rays after 5 dt (J and K). The expression levels are comparable to untreated fish (L).
After 10 dt fgfr1 is more strongly expressed in the ventral-most fin-rays (O) compared to other rays (M, N), which may correspond to the formation of a small ventral swordlet [20,22]. White arrowheads indicate gene expression. (X. helleri: n = 10 for

and X. helleri are due to species-specific differences
between the gonopodia [33].

fgfr1 and msxC show similar expression profiles in
regenerating swords
High levels of msxC transcription are also associated with
regenerating sword rays after amputation [23]. It is
assumed that the general mechanisms of growth control
that act during early development are re-established dur-

ing regeneration [36,37]. To test whether fgfr1 is similarly
regulated in regenerating and in developing sword rays,
we assayed gene expression in caudal fin blastemata. The
regeneration kinetics of X. helleri roughly equals that of
zebrafish at 25°C, where the regenerative outgrowth starts
at ~4 dpa [38]. fgfr1 is expressed in the basal layer of the
epidermis and in a proximal region, which are likely to be
scleroblasts (Figure 5A). msxC and fgfr1 expression overlap in these cells. Furthermore, msxC is not expressed in

Expression of fgfr1 and msxC in the developing
gonopodia of X. helleri and X. maculatus. fgfr1 and msxC
are both expressed in developing gonopodia of X. helleri and
X. maculatus. In X. helleri fgfr1 is up-regulated at 5 days (A)
and 10 days (C) of treatment in mesenchymal cells (B) of the
main gonopodium-forming rays 3–5 compared to control fins
(G). In addition fgfr1 is strongly expressed in the interray tissue of those rays (A, C). As in developing swords, fgfr1
expression overlaps with msxC expression (D-F). In early
stages of gonopodium development (5 dt) of the platyfish X.
maculatus, the expression patterns of fgfr1 (H) and msxC (J)
resemble that of X. helleri. Both genes are up-regulated in the
same set of fin rays compared to untreated controls (L).
Expression of both genes (I, K) at 10 dt is comparable to that
of X. helleri with species-specific differences in the shape of
growing rays. Black arrowheads indicate the expression in
the distal part of the fin rays, white arrowheads indicate
inter-ray expression. (X. helleri: n = 10 for every stage and

the basal epidermal layer, but transcription is high in the
distal blastema (Figure 5B). Sword rays and non-sword
rays show similar levels of fgfr1 and msxC at different
stages of regenerative outgrowth (Figures 5C–F and Figures 5G, H). Both genes stay highly up-regulated in growing blastemata until 7 dpa (Figures 5E–H).
At 11 dpa, when the sword region has begun to overgrow
the rest of the regenerate, fgfr1 and msxC become differently regulated in sword rays compared to other rays. Both
fgfr1 (Figure 5I) and msxC (Figure 5J) are more strongly
expressed in sword rays than in non-sword rays, even
though this difference in expression was more clearly
observed for msxC. Judging from these data, it is apparent
that both genes are similarly regulated in developing as
well as regenerating swords. Furthermore, it is likely that
due to the lack of fgfr1 expression in the distal blastema,
msxC expression in this domain is regulated by factors
other than Fgfr1.

Figure 4

fgf24 and fgf20a are expressed in regenerating, but not
developing swords
To further analyse the regulation of sword development
and regeneration upstream of fgfr1, we cloned two putative ligands of Fgfr1, fgf24 and fgf20a, which are known to
be involved in fin regeneration and development
[27,28,39]. To this end we examined the expression patterns of both genes in developing and regenerating
swords. We detected strong expression of fgf24 and fgf20a
in caudal fin regenerates up to 3 dpa and ~1 dpa, respectively, before the transcription rate of both genes
decreased (Figures 6A–D and data not shown). Therefore

both genes are unlikely to play a role in the regulation of
Fgf-signalling or msxC in later stages of sword regeneration, when gene regulation becomes different between
sword and non-sword rays. In addition, as neither fgf24
nor fgf20a were expressed in developing swords or
gonopodia (data not shown), it is unlikely that they act as
ligands for Fgfr1 during these processes.
Expression levels of fgfr1 and msxC are correlated with
growth rates of regenerating fin rays

expression are generally associated with extended growth

There is no overall clearly visible difference in expression of
fgfr1 (C-F) and msxC (G, H) between sword and non-sword

of fin rays, we analysed gene expression in regenerating
caudal fins of X. maculatus brushtail mutants (Figure 1D).
Individuals carrying the dominant brushtail mutation are
characterized by a life-long overgrowth of medial fin rays
in the caudal fin (compare Figures 7A and 7B), which is
independent of sex or sexual maturity [40]. The mutation
causing this phenotype is not known. Mature male brushtail mutants also grow a swordlet, a small ventral fin
extension (Figure 7B), similar to the ventral caudal fin
extension that naturally occurs in two species of platyfish,
X. andersi and X. xiphidium, and similar to that which can
be artificially produced by high levels of exogenous testosterone in some species of platyfish such as X. maculatus
[20,22]. However, it lacks the pigmentation pattern typical of swords in swordtails. Since brushtail mutants are
already born with a brush [40] and developing embryos
are not viable when extracted from their mothers, we
asked whether fgfr1 and msxC are differently expressed in
regenerating brush rays, compared to more dorsal or ventral caudal fin rays. Expression of fgfr1 and msxC is strongest in the median fin rays (Figures 7C–J), which becomes
particularly obvious after 4 dpa. Both genes show a graded
expression pattern with a decrease of expression levels
towards the dorsal and ventral fin margins (Figures 7D–F,
H–J). At later stages of regeneration fgfr1 and msxC are
also stronger expressed in the ventral-most caudal fin rays
of males that form the swordlet, but was absent in females
(compare Figure 7F to 7J, and not shown).

Figure 5

The graded expression patterns suggest that fgfr1 and msxC
correlate with different growth rates of median fin rays
compared to more ventral or dorsal rays. In order to test
this hypothesis, we amputated the caudal fins of adult

brushtail mutants and compared the growth rates of regenerating fin rays at different positions within the caudal fin.
We did this by calculating the average length difference
between the regenerate of the median fin ray 1 and more
dorsal fin rays 4, 6 and 8 at 4 dpa and 8 dpa (Figure 8A).
We found that the individual fin rays show significantly
different regeneration rates (as determined by a t-test),
depending on their position within the caudal fin, with
the median-most ray 1 showing the fastest regeneration
rate (Figure 8B). The regeneration rate decreases the more
closely a fin ray is located to the dorsal edge of the fin,
with regenerating ray 8 showing the slowest regeneration
rate (Figure 8B). Differences in regeneration rates between
fin rays according to their position in the caudal fin are
more pronounced at 8 dpa (Figure 8B). The correlation
between higher fgfr1 and msxC expression levels and
enhanced regenerative outgrowth suggests that both genes
are involved in modulating the growth rate of individual
fin rays.

Discussion
The sword is a sexually selected trait in swordtail fish that
is thought to have evolved in the common ancestor of all
extant Xiphophorus fishes, and was lost secondarily in the
lineage leading to the platyfish [5,9,10]. Questions about
the evolution and the subsequent loss of the sword can
therefore be cogently formulated within this phylogenetic

framework. Zander and Dzwillo coined the term "sword
genes" for those genes that confer an ability to produce a
sword in hybrids of platyfish and swordtails [18]. We
employed a candidate gene approach to more broadly
identify genes involved in sword development. We reasoned that genes that act in growth-dependent processes
like fin regeneration might also be suitable candidates for
regulating growth in growing fin rays. We therefore evaluated changes to the expression of genes involved in Fgfsignalling, a signalling pathway known to control outgrowth, and msxC expression in regenerating caudal fins
of zebrafish [25,28,30].
fgfr1 expression in developing and regenerating swords
Our results show that fgfr1 is specifically up-regulated in
growing fin rays of the sword and the gonopodial rays of
the 3–4–5 complex as a response to the induction of male
sexual trait formation by exogenously supplied testosterone. Several studies suggest that Fgfr1 plays essential roles
during appendage formation and regeneration: expression of fgfr1 is re-established during regeneration of limbs
and caudal fins [25,41], and loss of fgfr1 function in these
tissues blocks blastema formation and regenerative outgrowth [25,26,42]. Moreover, Fgfr1 is involved in supporting outgrowth of the mouse limb bud by maintaining
mesenchymal cell survival and influencing the development and identity of digits [43,44]. Interestingly, the spa-

Expression of fgfr1 and msxC in regenerating caudal fins of brushtail mutants

Expression of fgfr1 and msxC in regenerating caudal fins of brushtail mutants. Compared to a wildtype platyfish (A),
X. maculatus brushtail mutants possess elongated median caudal fin rays (B). Male brushtail mutants also develop a small ventral
extension of the caudal fin (swordlet). fgfr1 and msxC show a graded expression pattern in regenerating caudal fins of brushtail
mutants at different stages of regeneration with strongest expression in the median fin rays (C-J). fgfr1 (C-F) and msxC (G-J) are
expressed in a similar pattern as in X. helleri regenerating caudal fins. At later stages of regeneration, fgfr1 (F) and msxC show
stronger expression in the ventral-most caudal fin rays of males compared to females (J).

Different regeneration rate of brushtail fin rays, depending on their position in the caudal fin
Figure 8
Different regeneration rate of brushtail fin rays, depending on their position in the caudal fin. The regenerate's
length of four different fin rays, highlighted in the schematic drawing of an adult brushtail fin (A) were measured at 4 days post
amputation (dpa) and 8 dpa. The regenerate's length of the dorsal fin rays 4, 6 and 8 were then compared to that of the median
fin ray 1. Dorsal fin rays regenerate more slowly than the median fin ray 1, shown as average length difference between fin ray
regenerates (B). The difference in regeneration rate increases the closer a fin ray is located to the dorsal edge of the fin. The
position dependence of regeneration rates is more obvious at 8 dpa (n = 11; *P < 0.00001, t-test).

tio-temporal expression pattern of fgfr1 generally overlaps
with that of the transcription factor msxC in developing
swords and gonopodia [23]. msx genes are known to keep
cells in an undifferentiated state by promoting cell proliferation [45,46]. In zebrafish, msxB has been shown to regulate cell proliferation in the distal blastema of
regenerating caudal fins [26,47]. Accordingly, knockdown and chemical inhibition of Fgfr1-signalling abolishes the expression of msxB and msxC [25,26]. Therefore,
as judged by the up-regulation in growing sword and
gonopodial rays, we propose that an increase in fgfr1mediated signalling regulates cell-proliferation, similar to
the processes in fin regeneration, through the activation of
target genes like msxC.
Are there positional values that bias the ventral caudal fin
for sword development? In a set of transplantation experiments it has been shown that the two major sword rays,
V8 and V9, act to organize flanking rays into the developing sword [19]. This is achieved through a non-autonomous signalling process in which fin rays are induced to
grow more strongly the closer they develop to V8 and V9.
The development of sword rays is initiated through androgen-signalling in maturing juvenile fish, which leads to
mainly autonomous growth of rays V8 and V9 and inductive signalling to flanking rays V7 and V10, which together
comprise the mature sword. Moreover, the potential to
develop organizing activity in V8 and V9 is established
during embryonic or larval development [19]. In
zebrafish ventral tail fin tissue has been fate-mapped to
late gastrula stage embryos [48,49]. It is therefore likely
that positional information within the Xiphophorus caudal
fin is also attained during embryonic stages. Genes of the
TGFβ gene family, such as alk8/lost-a-fin or tolloid/mini fin,
whose mutant phenotypes include defects of the ventral
caudal fin [50,51], could therefore provide all or part of
the positional information that is used to specify sword
ray fate.
To test whether fgfr1 and msxC are also differently regulated in regenerating swords, and to further characterize
these interactions at the cellular level, we compared
expression in regenerating sword and non-sword rays. An
overlap of fgfr1 and msxC expression was detected in scleroblasts. In addition, fgfr1 is expressed in the basal layer of
the epidermis, where msxC was not found, suggesting that
signalling through fgfr1 alone is not sufficient to activate
msxC expression in the basal epidermal layer. Likewise,
msxC is temporally activated in the distal blastema,
although fgfr1 is absent from this domain, suggesting that
msxC is regulated by signals other than fgfr1 in the distal
blastema. Interestingly, such a distal expression domain
of fgfr1 is described in zebrafish [25], indicating speciesspecific differences in fgfr1- and, probably, in msxC-regulation between X. helleri and D. rerio. This may not be all

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/98

that surprising since these two fish species are evolutionary rather distantly related [52,53]. In addition, functional
differences between zebrafish and medaka fgfr1 have
recently been demonstrated [54]. We also noted that,
although expression levels of fgfr1 are clearly elevated in
sword rays, when compared to non-sword rays, the difference was never as strongly as that observed for msxC. A
disproportionally higher activation, like for msxC, might
be expected in a scenario where msxC expression is up-regulated as part of the downstream effects of signalling
through Fgfr1.
fgfr1 and msxC are part of a network that regulates sword
development
We previously proposed that the gene regulatory network
underlying sword development did not evolve anew, but
was co-opted from the gonopodium [23]. The 3–4–5
complex of the gonopodium is likely to have evolved only
once in the common ancestors of all poeciliid fish and is
thus evolutionary older than the sword, which originated
in its fully developed form in the lineage leading to the
genus Xiphophorus [5,32,34]. In support of this view, the
regulatory dynamics of fgfr1 and msxC show very similar
expression patterns during gonopodium growth and caudal fin regeneration that are conserved between swordtails
and platyfish, whereas differences in later stages of gonopodium development are likely to reflect differences in species-specific morphology [33]. The similarities in gene
expression between swords and gonopodia supports the
hypothesis that sword development evolved by co-option
of an androgen-regulated genetic network from the evolutionary older gonopodium. fgfr1 is most likely one of a
number of regulatory nodes within an intricate network of
signalling pathways that converge on the activation of msx
genes. The observation that there is only partial co-expression between fgfr1 and msxC during regeneration supports
this notion.

There is compelling evidence that msx genes are also regulated by Bmp signalling during development and regeneration of vertebrate appendages [55-57]. For example,
inhibition of BMP signalling in the developing mouse
limb leads to down-regulation of Msx2 [57], while overactivation of the pathway results in up-regulation of Msx1
and Msx2 [55]. Activation may be direct, as Bmp4 induces
the interaction of Smads with Msx1 regulatory sequences
[58]. Bmp-regulation of Msx genes seems to be widely
conserved, since inhibition of Bmp signalling also leads to
down-regulation of msxb in regenerating fins [56] and to
a loss of Msx1 expression in the regenerating tail of Xenopus tadpoles [59]. Wnt signalling is a third component of
this regulatory network. Manipulation of its activity in
regenerating limbs, fins and tadpole tails showed that
Wnt signalling regulates the expression of msx and fgf
genes and is important for regenerative outgrowth [60-

62]. Recent work in the poeciliid fish Gambusia affinis had
shown that induction of sonic hedgehog (shh) expression
by androgens is required for gonopodium formation [63].
Given that Shh controls dermal bone development in the
zebrafish caudal fin [47], it is likely that also Shh signalling may be required for sword development. Functional
tests will be required to dissect the molecular network that
controls msxC expression to better understand how these
different signalling pathways act together to shape the
male sword. The similarities in gene expression between
swords and gonopodia supports the hypothesis that
sword development evolved by co-option of a modular
androgen-regulated fgfr1/msxC network from the evolutionary older gonopodium.
Juveniles of X. maculatus fail to up-regulate fgfr1 and msxC
in the ventral caudal fin rays at testosterone-levels that
otherwise cause sword development in swordtails after 4
days of treatment. It is only after prolonged exposure that
both genes start to be expressed more strongly in the ventral-most rays. This expression marks the development of
a "swordlet", a small colourless caudal fin extension, that
develops in some platy species under excessive exposure
to testosterone [20,22]. A swordlet is also found naturally
in the species X. andersi and X. xiphidium and outside the
genus Xiphophorus in other species of poeciliid fishes, e.g.
in Poecilia petenensis. The failure to up-regulate the fgfr1/
msxC network in response to endogenous androgens may
have caused the loss of swords in the lineage leading to
the platyfish. Since artificially high levels of testosterone
can overcome this inhibition ([20,22] and Figure 3), the
evolutionary changes that led to sword-loss may have
been quantitative ones that could have altered the
strength of genetic interactions within the fgfr1/msxC network or its upstream regulation. One attractive possibility
for the evolutionary loss of swords therefore would be an
acquired loss in the sensitivity of the fgfr1/msxC network
to be activated by androgen-signalling (Figure 9), possibly
at the level of fgf regulation.
brushtail enhances sword development in platyfish
We analysed fin ray regeneration in X. maculatus brushtail,
a mutant that spontaneously arose in platy strains within
the pet trade (Figure 1D). The brush resembles the sword
with regard to size, but occurs in both sexes, consists of
medial fin rays, and lacks conspicuous pigmentation [40].
In contrast to swords, brushes are formed during embryonic or larval development and show allometric growth
throughout the whole life of an individual. In adult male
platyfish, brushtail often also induces a swordlet on the
ventral caudal fin margin (M. Schartl, personal communication). The X. maculatus brushtail fish used in our studies
are not congenic and may contain alleles derived from
hybrids between swordtails and X. maculatus. It could thus
be argued that brushtail hybrids are more inclined to

dal fin control in prospective sword rays in the ventral cauGrowth 9
Growth control in prospective sword rays in the ventral caudal fin. An signalling network that includes activation of fgfr1 and msxC expression regulates growth of ventral
rays in the caudal fin and is activated by endogenous levels of
testosterone in swordtails (A); in platyfish an evolutionary
weakening (interrupted arrow) in the ability of testosterone
to activate the network results in insufficient signalling and
the absence of sword development (B); high exogenous levels of testosterone overcome the inhibition upstream of the
network and induce a swordlet in some platyfish species (C);
the platyfish mutant brushtail raises overall signalling levels of
the network in all rays, allowing endogenous testosterone to
suffice for the induction of a swordlet in male fish (D). Width

develop swords due to introgression of sword alleles.
However, we note that formation of the swordlet in males
is always linked to the brushtail phenotype and does not
occur in male brushless siblings that derive from a cross
between brushtail parents. Therefore brushtail enhances a
dormant program of sword development [64], similar to
prolonged exposure to testosterone in X. maculatus. We
thus reasoned that the mechanisms of fin growth in
swords and brushes may be similar. Our analysis of fin ray
regeneration revealed that (1) regeneration rates in brushtail and swordtail caudal fins differed in that sword rays
regenerate at the same rate as the rest of the fin (Figures 5
and 7 and [23]), whereas rays within the brush exhibit
accelerated regeneration rates the closer they are to the
middle of the fin, and (2) expression levels of fgfr1 and
msxC show a positive correlation with regeneration rates.
Therefore, brushtail mutants lend support to the hypothesis that the strength of fgfr1/msxC expression is correlated
with the rate of regenerative growth, which in brushtail
mirrors the life-long overgrowth of the brush. In contrast,
sword rays initially exhibit regeneration rates and strong
fgfr1/msxC expression indistinguishable from non-sword
rays. Growth and gene expression ceases once rays have
reconstituted the previous fin length, while fgfr1/msxC
transcription remains high in the sword. The correspondence of gene expression levels in swords, gonopodia, and

BMC Developmental Biology 2008, 8:98

in brushtail suggests that fgfr1 and msxC expression are a
general readout of proliferation in fin rays.
Pharmacological interference with fgfr1 signalling is not
practicable in Xiphophorus fish, as treatments using the
standard zebrafish assay, where many fish are treated in
small volumes of water, cause a high mortality, while
treatments in volumes used in our testosterone experiments would require excessive amounts of the drug.
Moreover, electroporation of morpholinos has failed due
to persistent problems with the initial injection, which
has to be performed into growing fin rays, rather than into
a regeneration blastema (not shown). Therefore we had to
resolve to associative studies of gene expression in a phylogenetic framework and in mutants to study the involvement of candidate genes in sword development.
As an explanation of the development of a swordlet in
adult male brushtail platyfish, our findings suggest that
fgfr1/msxC-mediated signalling is constitutively activated
throughout the brushtail caudal fin and already in young
larvae of both sexes, with strong activation in medial rays
and lower, yet elevated levels at the margins. Although
endogenous levels of testosterone in platyfish are usually
not sufficient to induce or maintain a sword, growth of a
swordlet could nevertheless ensue if in maturing male
platyfish both testosterone- and brushtail-activated signalling pathways converged on the activation of the fgfr1/
msxC regulatory network. brushtail simulates the effect of
high exogenous doses of testosterone on swordlet formation in platyfish, in agreement with the idea that the fgfr1/
msxC network is a major downstream target of androgen
signalling during sword development (Figure 9). It is
interesting to note that brushtail re-awakens a dormant
program for sword development that had been evolutionary lost in platyfish. Therefore, swordlets likely employ at
least parts of the developmental program controlling
sword growth [64]. An examination of the molecular
mechanisms that activate fgfr1/msxC signalling in brushtail
will be valuable for exploring the regulation of this gene
network in controlling the growth of ventral caudal fin
rays.
The ligands required for Fgfr1 activation during fin
development remain elusive
To examine the regulation of fin growth upstream of fgfr1,
we isolated fgf20a and fgf24 as potential ligands in caudal
fins that develop a sword under testosterone treatment. In
zebrafish, fgf20a plays an essential role in blastema formation, while fgf24 is expressed in regenerating caudal fins
and is required for pectoral fin bud initiation
[25,27,28,39]. Therefore, both genes are putative candidates to control early phases of sword and gonopodium
development such as the re-initiation of fin growth under
testosterone. We show that both genes are transiently

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/98

expressed in regenerating fin rays and are down-regulated
after 3 dpa, suggesting that fgf20a and fgf24 fulfill similar
functions in blastema formation in zebrafish and X. helleri. Since neither gene was expressed at any detectable
level in developing swords or gonopodia, other fgfs
remain attractive candidates that might mediate the activation of sword development downstream of testosterone-activated androgen receptors. A number of other Fgfs
are known with confirmed roles during appendage formation and regeneration, such as Fgf2, Fgf4, Fgf8 and Fgf10,
which are able to induce regeneration in Xenopus limbs or
chick limb buds [65-67], and Fgf16 as well as Fgf8, Fgf4
and Fgf10, which are involved in zebrafish pectoral fin
development (reviewed in [68]). Further investigation of
these candidate genes should uncover the ligand of Fgfr1
that controls development of the sword and gonopodium.

Conclusion
We have shown a correspondence of fgfr1 and msxC
expression levels in developing and regenerating swords,
gonopodia, and in the fin-overgrowth mutant brushtail,
which suggests that fgfr1 and msxC are part of a genetic
network that regulates the rates of growth and regeneration in male-specific modifications of adult fins in swordtails and platyfish. Through inter-species comparisons
with swordless platyfish, we have shown that high levels
of fgfr1 expression are associated with developing sword
rays. In line with this assertion brushtail mutant caudal fin
rays exhibit elevated expression of this network, leading
both to a regionalised fin overgrowth phenotype and to
an enhancement of an otherwise dormant program of
sword development in platyfish. Taken together, we propose that changes in the regulation of a genetic network
that includes fgfr1 and msxC contribute to the loss of the
sword in the platyfish lineage. Our characterization of the
two known regulators of Fgf signalling in teleost fin regeneration, fgf20a and fgf24, rules out an involvement in
sword development, but other Fgfs remain candidates that
might mediate the activation of sword development
downstream of testosterone-activated androgen receptors.
Finally, the similarities in gene expression between
swords and gonopodia supports the hypothesis that
sword development evolved by co-option of an androgenregulated fgfr1/msxC network from the evolutionary older
gonopodium.

Methods
Fish stocks and maintenance
Xiphophorus helleri and X. maculatus were taken from
stocks kept at the animal research facility at the University
of Konstanz. The X. maculatus brushtail mutant, a commercial breed, was obtained from a local pet shop. Fish were
maintained on a 12:12 h light:dark cycle at 24°C in 110-

litre densely planted aquaria and were fed TetraMin flakes
and Artemia.
Testosterone treatment and fin regeneration
Up to six juvenile individuals of X. helleri, aged between 3
and 6 months, were placed in a 30-litre tank. 17-α-Methyltestosterone (1 mg/ml stock solution in ethanol; SigmaAldrich, Munich, Germany) was added to the water twice
a week to a final concentration of 10 μg/l. After 5 or 10
days of testosterone treatment approximately 1/3 of the
distal part of the caudal fin and approximately 2/3 of the
anal fin was amputated using a sterile razor blade. For fin
amputation fish were anesthetized by incubation in a
solution of 0.08 mg/ml tricaine (3-aminobenzoicacidethylester-methanesulfonate; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich,
Germany).

For regeneration experiments adult X. helleri and X. maculatus individuals were anesthetized and 1/3 of the caudal
fin was amputated. Subsequently, fins were allowed to
regenerate at 24°C for variable time periods, without
addition of 17-α-Methyltestosterone, depending on the
experiment. Fish were anesthetized again and the blastema was removed. Fins and blastemata used for in situ
hybridisation were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
(Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) overnight, transferred to methanol and
stored at -20°C until use.
Cloning fgfr1, fgf24 and fgf20a
Total RNA was isolated from caudal fin blastemata 24 hpa
(for fgf20a), 48 hpa (for fgf24) and 72 hpa (for fgfr1) and
used for cDNA synthesis as described [23]. Degenerate
Primers were designed based on an alignment of cDNAs
from Danio rerio, Tetraodon nigroviridis and Takifugu
rubripes to amplify cDNA fragments of the desired genes.
A 1299 kb fgfr1 fragment was amplified by PCR using the
Primer pair fgfr-fw1: 5'-CCIGAIAARATGGARAARAARYTGCAYGC-3' and fgfr-rev1: 5'-CIGGIACYTGGTMIGGRTTRTARCA-3'. A 605 bp fgf24 fragment was amplified by
PCR using the Primers fgf24-fw1: 5'-GAKAGIGCARCRIGYIYGGAIRC-3' fgf24-rev1: 5'-GTCCICYYIKCCYTTKGGYTGGCGC-3' and fgf24-rev2: 5'-CCAGTATAAATAAMAY
RACAGACAC-3'. A 497 bp fgf20a fragment was amplified
by PCR using the Primer pair fgf20a-fw2: 5'-GGSTCTCATTTCGTYCTCAC-3' and fgf20-rev0: 5'-GTRTTRTACCARTTYTCYTC-3'.

To obtain fgf24/fgf20a fragments of appropriate size for
RNA probe generation 3'RACE reactions were performed
using a 3'RACE kit (Roche). A ~1,3 kb fgf24 fragment was
amplified using the gene-specific primers fgf24R-fw1: 5'CTACAGCAGGACCACGGGCAAAC-3' and fgf24R-fw2:
5'-CAAGAAAGGCTCACGCACCACGC-3'. A ~1,2 kb
fgf20a fragment was amplified using the gene-specific

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/98

primers fgf20a-fw1: 5'-CATCAGAGGAGTGGACAGCGGC
-3' and fgf20a-fw2: 5'-CGCCATGAACAGCAAGGGGGAG3'. The PCR products were gel-purified using the QIAquick
Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and cloned
into the pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) for sequencing.
Whole-mount in situ hybridisation
Antisense and sense RNA probes were generated using a
digoxigenin labelling kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).
Probes for fgfr1, fgf24 and fgf20a were generated from the
cDNA fragments listed above. msxC probes were generated from a 635 bp cDNA fragment [23]. Because of the
high sequence conservation within the genus, X. helleri
antisense probes could also be used in the platyfish X.
maculatus.

In situ hybridisation of Xiphophorus fins and blastemata
were performed as described [25] with several modifications. Prehybridisation was done 4 h at 68°C in formamide solution (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 0,1% Tween-20,
pH to 6 with 1 M citric acid). Post-hybridisation washing
steps were initiated at 68°C with formamide solution. To
block unspecific binding sites 0,5% blocking reagent
(Roche, Mannheim, Germany) in PBST (PBS/0.1%
Tween-20) was used. Antibody incubation was done at
4°C overnight. After fixation of stained fins/blastemata,
the tissue was washed twice for 20 min in PBST, 20 min in
ethanol/PBST (70:30) and 20 min in 100% ethanol and
stored at 4°C. The specificity anti-sense probes were verified with sense probe experiments.
In situ hybridisation on longitudinal sections
4 day-old caudal fin blastemata and anal fins from individuals treated with 17-α-Methyltestosterone for 5 days
were fixed in 4 % Paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich,
Munich, Germany). Longitudinal sections of 10 μm thickness were created using a Reichert-Jung Autocut 2040
Microtome and in situ hybridisation was performed as
described [69].
Microscopy and image editing
Fin explants and brushtail caudal fins were analysed using
a Zeiss Stemi SV11 Apo. Pictures were taken using the
AxioVision software v3.1 (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and the
digital camera Zeiss AxioCam MRc. The pictures were
processed using Adobe Photoshop.
Fin ray measurement and calculation
Pictures from regenerating caudal fins of males and
females were photographed at 4 and 8 days post amputation. The regenerate length of the median fin ray 1 and
more dorsal fin rays 4, 6 and 8 was measured using the
software ImageJ [70]. In case of bifurcation both semirays' regenerates were measured and the average was cal-

culated. To eliminate variation in regeneration speed
between the individuals, the difference in length between
the regenerate of the median ray 1 and the three other ray
regenerates were calculated for each fish. Last, the average
was calculated for each difference and graphically presented using Microsoft Excel. A paired, one-tail t-test was
used to determine whether the calculated average distances differ significantly from each other.
Phylogenetic analysis and motif prediction
Phylogenetic trees of fgf receptors, the fgf8/17/18/24 and
the fgf9/16/20 subfamily were constructed using Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods of phylogeny inference [71]. ML analyses were performed using
PHYML [72]. The best fitting models of sequence evolution for ML were obtained by ModelTest 3.7 [73]. ML tree
topologies were evaluated by a bootstrap analysis with
500 replicates [74]. To confirm obtained Tree topologies
Bayesian analyses were initiated with random seed trees
and were run for 100,000 generations for fgf receptors and
fgf8/17/18/24 and 1000,000 generations for fgf9/16/20.

The Markov chains were sampled at intervals of 100 generations with a burn in of 100 trees for fgf receptors and
fgf8/17/18/24 and 500 trees for fgf9/16/20. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were conducted with MrBayes 3.0b4
[75] using the general time reversible model GTR+I+G
[76] for fgf receptors and fgf8/17/18/24 and the Tamura-Nei
model TrN+I+G [77] for fgf9/16/20. The sequences used
for the analysis are listed in Table 1. Sequences that could
not be aligned with confidence were excluded from the
analysis. ScanProsite [78] was used to predict conserved
motifs in the translated amino acid sequences.

Sequence and domain structure of X. helleri fgf24 and fgf20a. The
633 bp fgf24 sequence from X. helleri represents the full ORF of the gene,
while the 663 bp sequence of X. helleri fgf20a misses a part of the 5'
region of the ORF (A). The Heparin-binding growth factors/fibroblast
growth factor (HBGF/FGF) family signature is marked in blue. B shows
a schematic drawing of the two isolated cDNA fragments and their
HBGF/FGF-coding portions.
