Abstract
Background: The serine/threonine kinase StkP of Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major virulence
factor in the mouse model of infection. StkP is a modular protein with a N-terminal kinase domain
a C-terminal PASTA domain carrying the signature of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) and
prokaryotic serine threonine kinase. In laboratory cultures, one target of StkP is the
phosphoglucosamine mutase GlmM involved in the first steps of peptidoglycan biosynthesis. In
order to further elucidate the importance of StkP in S. pneumoniae, its role in resistance to βlactams has been assessed by mutational analysis in laboratory cultures and its genetic conservation
has been investigated in isolates from infected sites (virulent), asymptomatic carriers, susceptible
and non-susceptible to β-lactams.
Results: Deletion replacement mutation in stkP conferred hypersensitivity to penicillin G and was
epistatic on mutations in PBP2X, PBP2B and PBP1A from the resistant 9V clinical isolate URA1258.
Genetic analysis of 55 clinical isolates identified 11 StkP alleles differing from the reference R6 allele.
None relevant mutation in the kinase or the PASTA domains were found to account for
susceptibility of the isolates. Rather the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the strains
appeared to be determined by their PBP alleles.
Conclusion: The results of genetic dissection analysis in lab strain Cp1015 reveal that StkP is
involved in the bacterial response to penicillin and is epistatic on mutations PBP 2B, 2X and 1A.
However analysis of the clinical isolates did not allow us to find the StkP alleles putatively involved
in determining the virulence or the resistance level of a given strain, suggesting a strong
conservation of StkP in clinical isolates.

Background
Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the main aetiological
agents of invasive infectious disease. Penicillin-resistant
pneumococci were first observed in the 70s, and resist-

ance to penicillin and multidrug-resistance have since
then increased worldwide. Cell-wall biosynthetic
enzymes named Penicillin Binding Proteins (PBP) are the
targets for β-lactam antibiotics; mutations in these pro-

teins constitute a major mechanism of resistance in clinical isolates. In laboratory strains, murMN, ciaRH and cpoA
genes are also involved in penicillin susceptibility suggesting their involvement in cell wall metabolism [1-3]. One
of the first steps of cell wall biosynthesis is catalysed by the
phosphoglucosamine mutase GlmM [4]. In Escherichia
coli, GlmM is activated by phosphorylation and it has
been shown, in vitro, that GlmM of S. pneumoniae is a substrate for the serine/threonine kinase Stk, suggesting a role
for StkP in cell wall metabolism [5,6].
StkP protein from S. pneumoniae contains a eukaryotic
kinase domain (Hanks kinase domain) and a PASTA
(penicillin-binding protein and serine threonine kinase)
domain signature only found in prokaryotes and putatively involved in cell wall sensing [7]. In this study we
evaluate the role of StkP in β-lactam susceptibility both in
"the model laboratory strain Cp1015" and in natural clinical isolates carrying different PBP alleles.

Methods
Bacterial strains, plasmids and growth conditions
The plasmids and strains used in this study are described
in Table 1[8]. Escherichia coli was grown in LB (Difco,
Sparks, Maryland) supplemented or not with ampicillin
(100 μg ml-1) (Atral, Castanheira do Ribatejo, Portugal).
S. pneumoniae clinical isolates were grown at 35°C on
Columbia agar plates supplemented with 5% horse blood

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/121

(Biomerieux, Carnaxide, Portugal), in an atmosphere
enriched with 5% CO2. Serotyping was performed by the
Quellung reaction with antisera produced by the Statens
Seruminstitut, Copenhagen, Denmark [9]. Laboratory
unencapsulated strains derived from D39 were routinely
grown in casitone and tryptone (CAT) medium at 37°C
[10]. CTM transformation medium was used to induce
competence and for transformation, as described previously [11]. The CSP concentration was 100 ng ml-1 and
DNA concentration was 1 μg ml-1. The chromosomal
source of DNA carrying mutated PBP alleles was the 9V
derivative Spain23F-1 clone (strain URA1258) which carries the following mutations near or within the conserved
motifs on the PBPs: Gln443Glu, Thr451Ala, Glu481Gly,
Ser485Ala and Thr494Ala in PBP2B, Thr338Ala,

plates containing 0.1 μg ml-1 and 0.5 μg ml-1 penicillin,
and appropriate integration of PBP mutations was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Plates containing 2 μg
ml-1 rifampicin and 10 μg ml-1 chloramphenicol were
used to select rif-23 and Δstkp::cat transformants. All constructions were verified by PCR with the primers described
in Table 2[6,12]. Spontaneous mutation to penicillin in

DNA free medium was < 10-9. Penicillin G was from Atral,
Castanheira do Ribatejo, Portugal, and rifampicin was
from Aventis Pharma. To assess StkP and PBPs conservation 50 strains were randomly selected among those isolated between 1994 and 2005 in various areas in Portugal;
they included forty invasive isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid and ten colonizing isolates from the
nasopharynx of asymptomatic carriers. Half of the isolates
(n = 25) were non-susceptible to penicillin [minimal
inhibitory concentration (MIC) > 0.1 μg ml-1]. These isolates were compared to the following reference strains: the
highly resistant serotype 9V strain URA1258, two susceptible and three non-susceptible strains provided by the
ATCC and the unencapsulated strain R6 (Table 1).
Measurements of penicillin susceptibility
The MIC of penicillin G for the strains constructed were
determined in duplicate by E-test (AB Biodisk, Solma,
Sweden) according to the manufacturer's recommendations (incubation at 35°C in 5% CO2 for 18 to 24 H), and
for clinical isolates by an agar dilution method with the
testing conditions and susceptibility interpretation standards proposed by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) [13]. Strains were considered penicillin
susceptible for MIC values ≤ 0.06 μg ml-1, intermediate
MIC for values of 0.1 – 1 μg ml-1, and highly resistant for
MIC values ≥ 1.6 μg ml-1. Strains were classified as nonsusceptible for MIC values ≥ 0.1 μg ml-1, according to CLSI
criteria.
stkP genotyping by amplification and nucleotide
sequencing
The stkP gene of clinical strains was amplified by PCR
using the primers listed in Table 2 and a Qiagen multiplex
PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. In brief, this routinely
involved 40 cycles with an annealing temperature of 56°C
for 1 minute. The PCR products were purified on ExoSAPIT (USB, Cleveland, Ohio) and the nucleotide sequence
was established (BigDye Cycle sequencing kit v1.1 from
Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California). BioNumerics

software v3.5 (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium) was used for contig assemblages of the DNA
sequences.
Genetic diversity of the StkP kinase in 56 pneumococcal
strains
The amino acid sequences deduced from the 56 stkP genes
were aligned using the CLUSTALW program built in the
MEGA version 4 software package [14]. There were a total
of 637 positions in the final dataset, of which 8 were parsimony informative. The evolutionary history was
inferred using the Maximum Parsimony (MP) method
[15]. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1000
replicates was taken to represent the evolutionary history
of the stkP gene [16]. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% of bootstrap replicates
were collapsed. The MP tree was obtained using the CloseNeighbor-Interchange algorithm [17] with search level 3
[16,17] in which the initial trees were obtained with the
random addition of sequences (10 replicates). The tree is
drawn to scale with branch lengths calculated by the average pathway method [17] and with the number of
changes over the whole sequence as units.
Estimates of Average Evolutionary Divergence over
Sequence Pairs of stkP within penicillin susceptibility
groups
The number of amino acid and of nucleotide substitutions per site was averaged over all sequence pairs within
each group by the Poisson correction method and the
Maximum Composite Likelihood method, respectively,
using MEGA version 4 software [14]. Standard error estimates were obtained by the bootstrap procedure (1000
replicates).
StkP modelling
A 3D-model of the kinase domain of the StkP protein
(271 residues long) of strain R6 was obtained using the
sequence (accession number NP_359169). BLASTP analysis indicated that the serine-threonine kinase from strain
R6 has 63% sequence identity with serine-threonine

kinase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (PDB ID: 1o6yA). The
following structure PDB ID: 1o6yA; 1mruA.pdb,
1mruB.pdb, 1y8gB.pdb and 1zmwB.pdb were used as a
template for building a homology model for the kinase
domain of StkP with the SWISS-MODEL server [18,19].
Ramachandran plot analysis for phi and psi torsion angles
indicated that 95.9% of residues were in the allowed
region of the plot, which is more than the average cut-off
of 90% used in most reliable models [20]. The final alignment adjustments and visualisation were undertaken with
Deep View/Swiss-PdbViewer version 3.7.
Genotyping of pbp genes
Genetic polymorphism of penA, pbpX and pbp1A genes
(encoding PBP2B, PBP2X and PBP1A, respectively) of all
clinical strains was investigated first by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. A number
was given to each restriction pattern for each of the three
pbp genes analysed, so the PBP profile has three numbers
(for example: 4-9-7). The full genes were amplified by
PCR using the primers described in Table 2 and 0.8 U of
iProof Polymerase (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with 35 cycles at an
annealing temperature of 56°C for 30 seconds. The
amplification products of penA and pbpX were digested for
1 H with 5 U of both HaeIII and RsaI restriction endonucleases. The amplification product of pbp1A was similarly
digested with HaeIII and DdeI (all restriction enzymes
supplied by New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mas.). The
digested products were separated on agarose gel. Dice
coefficient of similarity was used for cluster analysis with
the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages using BioNumerics software v3.5 (Applied Maths,
Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium). The position tolerance was
set to 1.0% and the optimization 1.5%. For each pbp gene
restriction pattern identified, one isolate was randomly
chosen and re-amplified by PCR for nucleotide sequencing. Contig assemblages of the DNA sequencing were performed as described above.

Results
Influence of stkP mutation on penicillin susceptibility in a
model system
The role of StkP in penicillin resistance, has been assessed
by genetic analysis in the laboratory transformable strain
Cp1015 (Table 1). The penicillin sensitive strain Cp1015
was transformed with DNA from the serotype 9V resistant
strain URA1258 related to the international multiresistant
clone Spain23F-1 [21]. Penicillin-resistant transformants
were selected on plates containing 0.1 μg ml-1 of penicillin. One transformant was isolated: strain Pen1, isogenic
to Cp1015 but with mutations in PBP2X and 2B and
resistant up to 0.125 μg ml-1 of penicillin. Strain Pen1 was
then transformed with DNA from URA1258 and transformants were selected on plates containing 0.5 μg ml-1
penicillin; this gave strain Pen2 isogenic to Pen1 but for
mutations in pbp1A and resistant to 0.5 μg ml-1 penicillin.
Transformation of strains Cp1015, Pen1 and Pen2 with
plasmid plSTK (Table 1) and selection on chloramphenicol plates gave the corresponding isogenic strains differing
by their PBP and StkP alleles. The MICs of these strains
were determined: the StkP- allele significantly and reproducibly increased penicillin susceptibility (Table 3). The
StkP- mutations not only increased the penicillin susceptibility of strain Cp1015 carrying wild-type penicillin binding proteins, but was also epistatic on mutations PBP2B,
2X and 1A; therefore StkP acts upstream from the PBPs.
Polymorphism of stkP in clinical isolates and relationship
to penicillin resistance
The effect of the StkP- mutation on penicillin susceptibility, as observed in an isogenic system, led us to question
the importance of the stkP gene on penicillin susceptibility among clinical isolates. Thus, we evaluated the level of
genetic conservation of the stkP gene and the presence of
mutations related to alterations of susceptibility to penicillin on a sample of clinical isolates recovered from invasive disease and asymptomatic carriers.

The sequence of the stkP gene from 50 clinical isolates and
6 reference strains was determined. The stkP gene in each
strain was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides complementary to sequences at -10 and +1997 of the gene. In
each case, a 2007 bp DNA fragment was obtained and the
nucleotide sequences confirmed that they corresponded
to stkP. There were 61 segregating sites (S) with a rate of
segregating sites per site (pS) of 0.033, resulting in 27
allelic variants with an average of 10.26 nucleotides substitutions per sequence. Analysis of the encoded aminoacid sequences revealed 11 segregating sites (S) and a rate
of segregating sites per site (pS) of 0.020, resulting in 12
allelic variants (including strain R6) with an average of
1.37 amino acid substitution per sequence (Additional
file 1: Table ST1 and Figure 1). Thus, the full-size StkP protein is well conserved in invasive and colonising clinical
isolates and independent of their penicillin-resistance
character.
We considered PASTA domains and kinase domains individually: nucleotide divergence was higher in the 5' terminal part of the gene encoding the kinase module (d =
0.0072; S.E.: 0.0013) than in the 3' part of the gene encoding the PASTA modules (d = 0.0048; S.E.: 0.0011). By contrast, amino acid divergence was higher in the PASTA
domains (d = 0.0037; S.E.: 0.0011) than in kinase domain
(d = 0.0012; S.E.: 0.0007). The distribution of the amino
acid allelic variants of StkP into penicillin-resistance
classes was assessed (Figure 1): alleles 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10
and 11 were found in penicillin-susceptible strains and
alleles 1, 4, 9 and 12 were found both in penicillin-resistant and -sensitive strains (Additional file 1: Table ST1).
The StkP amino acid sequence divergence was similar
among penicillin-susceptible strains (d = 0.0027; S.E.:
0.0009), penicillin-intermediate strains (d = 0.0015; S.E.:
0.0009) and highly resistant strains (d = 0.0017; S.E.:
0.0011).
To evaluate the effects of the StkP mutations on its kinase,
a model of the enzymatic domain, amino acid 4 to 274,
based on the sequence of the strain R6 was developed
(Accession number: NP_359169) (Figure 2). The mutations carried by the various alleles were located outside of
the catalytic site and appeared unlikely to affect the ATP
binding site. Thus, these clinical isolates are unlikely to
carry loss of kinase function mutations.
To evaluate the consequences of mutations in the PASTA
domains on the penicillin susceptibility of clinical isolates
we analysed the genetic polymorphism of PBP2B, PBP2X
and PBP1A, in relation the PASTA alleles in the different
isolates (Additional file 1: Table ST1). RFLP patterns 4, 5,
7, 9, 18 of PBP2B, patterns 5 to 9 of PBP2X and patterns 4
to 10, 13, 16 and 17 of PBP1A (see Additional file 1:
Tables ST2, ST3 and ST4) are not associated with muta-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/121

tions involved in penicillin resistance, according to previous descriptions [22-30]. Four PASTA alleles (StkP alleles:
3, 7, 10 and 11) were only found in sensitive strains
(URA3826, URA5133, URA3537, URA3388, URA3444,
URA6035, URA4549). These strains showed PBP profiles
characteristic of sensitive strains, suggesting that their
MICs were determined by their PBPs rather than mutation
in their PASTA sequence. The other PASTA alleles were
found in all the three classes of strains (high and intermediate resistance, and susceptibility) suggesting that this
allele did not affect the MIC. We checked, for each strain,
that the resistance character corresponded to the PBP profile (Additional file 1: Table ST1). Findings for strain
URA5132 were, however, more ambiguous: it was susceptible with a MIC of 0.006 μg ml-1 despite carrying the
PBP2X mutations Arg384Gly and Gln552Glu related to
resistance [22]; it also carries the Val623Ala PASTA allele
suggesting that it may have a putative suppressor function
leading to the susceptible phenotype. However, we did
not test whether the PASTA Val623Ala allele is directly
involved as a suppressor of the PBP mutations, partly
because mutation Val623Ala is the replacement of one
non polar amino acid with another. Note that this mutation was also found in resistant (URA5805 and URA4203)
and intermediate (URA4566, URA4731 and URA5779)
strains and therefore it is unlikely that it determines the
penicillin susceptibility of strain URA5132.

Discussion
This work presents two different approaches for the evaluation of StkP on penicillin susceptibility. By the Cp1015
model system, we present genetic and physiological evidence of the involvement of the serine threonine kinase
StkP in cell wall metabolism upstream from the steps catalysed by penicillin binding proteins PBP2B, 2X and 1A in
S. pneumoniae. The second approach allowed us to observe
that StkP is genetically conserved among clinical strains,
regardless of penicillin susceptibility or site of isolation.
Indeed, no change of genetic diversity or any specific
amino acid substitution was found to be related to isolates recovered from invasive disease or colonizing strains.
These results suggest that neither virulence nor penicillin
susceptibility cause a selection pressure on StkP. However,
the results obtained from the analysis of clinical strains,
seem to oppose the idea of an association of StkP with virulence [31], and with penicillin susceptibility found in the
model system in this work. This suggests that StkP may
play an important role in the homeostasis of pneumococcus in man, regardless of both virulence and penicillin
susceptibility, suggesting that none of the characteristics
play a central role on StkP. In fact, it has been suggested
that StkP is a global regulator of gene expression [32].
The work by Gienfing et al., described the conservation of
StkP among clinical strains and also observed the impact

of stkP mutation on penicillin susceptibility on a susceptible genetic background [33]. However the association
between PBPs and StkP mutation were not assessed. Here,
we showed that the role of StkP on penicillin susceptibility is not related to the major genetic determinants for
penicillin susceptibility in pneumococci among a set of
clinical and reference strains as well as in the set of penicillin resistant mutants.
A contribution of the StkP towards penicillin susceptibility, notably attributed to its PASTA domains, has already
been proposed elsewhere [34], but there was previously
no supporting experimental evidence. This role for StkP is
consistent with previous observations showing that the
phosphoglucomutase GlmM is involved in the first steps

of peptidoglycan biosynthesis is a target for StkP [6]. Consistent with this notion, GlmM in E. coli is activated by
phosphorylation [4] and in S. aureus functional GlmM is
needed for full expression of methicillin resistance [35].
Although StkP is not essential and loss of function mutations can be obtained in laboratory conditions ([6,31]
and this work), it is strongly conserved in clinical isolates,
reminiscent of housekeeping genes [36]; presumably, it
has an important role in natural niches. Extensive
sequence analysis of StkP in susceptible and resistant
pneumococcal isolates did not reveal any mutation significantly associated with susceptibility to penicillin. This
suggests that stkP is of great importance for the cellular
homeostatic mechanisms of S. pneumoniae and is not sub-

ject to the selective pressures caused by the β-lactams,
unlike pbp genes presenting mosaic structures.
PASTA domains in prokaryotic serine-threonine kinases
and PBP2X are involved in cell wall motif recognition [7].
Consistent with our study, Jones and Dyson reported that
the PASTA domain of STK from several species showed
high amino acid sequence divergence and Ka/Ks values,
suggesting that PASTA domain interact with a wider range
of stem-peptide ligands [7]. We report similar observations for invasive and colonizing strains. It is thus unlikely
that mutation in the kinase or the PASTA domains contributes to the characteristics of the virulent strains in our
collection.
Although the mechanism(s) regulating StkP activity
remain(s) to be determined, it is likely that GlmM under
the control of StkP is a control point for cell wall homeostasis and allows penicillin insult to the cell wall to be
bypassed. Interestingly, the highly conserved serine threonine-kinase of S. pneumoniae is thus involved in the processes underlying three key features of bacterial physiology
and evolution: virulence in animals, development of competence for genetic transformation culminating in gene
transfers [7], and susceptibility to penicillin (this work).
This makes StkP a potentially promising target in S. pneumoniae for the development of new prophylactic measurements against pneumococcal disease.

Conclusion

9.

In summary, the results of the present study suggest that
pneumococcal serine-theonine kinase (StkP) is related to
penicillin susceptibility, as demonstrated in isogenic
strains. However, is a highly conserved protein, not functionally related to the major genetic determinants for penicillin susceptibility in pneumococci, being a promising
target for the development of new therapies.
