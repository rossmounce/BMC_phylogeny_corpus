Abstract
Background: In addition to structural domains, most eukaryotic proteins possess intrinsically
disordered (ID) regions. Although ID regions often play important functional roles, their accurate
identification is difficult. As human transcription factors (TFs) constitute a typical group of proteins
with long ID regions, we regarded them as a model of all proteins and attempted to accurately
classify TFs into structural domains and ID regions. Although an extremely high fraction of ID
regions besides DNA binding and/or other domains was detected in human TFs in our previous
investigation, 20% of the residues were left unassigned. In this report, we exploit the generally
higher sequence divergence in ID regions than in structural regions to completely divide proteins
into structural domains and ID regions.
Results: The new dichotomic system first identifies domains of known structures, followed by
assignment of structural domains and ID regions with a combination of pre-existing tools and a
newly developed program based on sequence divergence, taking un-aligned regions into
consideration. The system was found to be highly accurate: its application to a set of proteins with
experimentally verified ID regions had an error rate as low as 2%. Application of this system to
human TFs (401 proteins) showed that 38% of the residues were in structural domains, while 62%
were in ID regions. The preponderance of ID regions makes a sharp contrast to TFs of Escherichia
coli (229 proteins), in which only 5% fell in ID regions. The method also revealed that 4.0% and
11.8% of the total length in human and E. coli TFs, respectively, are comprised of structural domains
whose structures have not been determined.
Conclusion: The present system verifies that sequence divergence including information of
unaligned regions is a good indicator of ID regions. The system for the first time estimates the
complete fractioning of structured/un-structured regions in human TFs, also revealing structural
domains without homology to known structures. These predicted novel structural domains are
good targets of structural genomics. When applied to other proteins, the system is expected to
uncover more novel structural domains.

Background
Recent studies revealed that a high fraction of proteins in
eukaryotes have long stretches of intrinsically disordered
(ID) regions [1,2]. Proteins with ID regions, abundant in
the cytosol and nucleus but scarce in mitochondria [3],
are frequently involved in cellular regulatory processes
such as transcription, translation, and cellular signaling
transduction [4-7]. The abundance of proteins with ID
regions in the cells can be tightly controlled by regulation
of transcript clearance, proteolytic degradation, and translational rate[8]. Transcription factors (TFs) such as activators, repressors, or enhancer-biding factors may be
considered typical, as most of them contain long stretches
of ID regions [9,10]. While human TFs are characterized
by a DNA-binding domain (DBD) and other structural
domains, 60% of them are composed only of a DBD and
ID regions [9]. Intriguingly some ID regions in TFs harbor
functional sites called transactivation domains (TADs),
which interact with coactivators and other factors of the
pre-initiation complex to transmit the activation signal to
RNA polymerase. In vitro experimental studies, particularly those with NMR spectroscopy, revealed that TADs of
various TFs are unstructured in isolation, but become
structured upon binding to their interaction partners
[4,11-17]. Prokaryotic TFs differ from eukaryotic TFs in
that they generally do not have long ID regions; DBD and/
or other structural domains occupy nearly the entire
lengths[18,19]. The molecular architecture composed of
structural domains and ID regions is generally found in
eukaryotic proteins, including membrane proteins [20].
Highly sensitive homology search tools, such as PSIBLAST [21] and HMMER [22], made it possible to identify
and locate structural domains along a protein sequence
with high confidence [23], if at least one homolog had its
3D structure experimentally determined. According to the
general view above, the regions of the protein to which no
known structure has been assigned should correspond
either to ID regions or to domains of unknown structure,
which we hereafter call "cryptic" structural domains. Thus,
if ID regions can be accurately distinguished from cryptic
domains, the entire length of any protein can be classified
into structural domains and ID regions.
Efficient computer programs have been developed for prediction of ID regions from protein sequences [24-27] and
utilized in genome-wide surveys [1,7,28]. All of these prediction methods are based on the fact that ID regions have
a characteristic skewed amino acid composition;
hydrophilic and charged residues are abundant, while
hydrophobic residues are scarce [29,30]. In the previous
study [9], we employed the profile-based disorder prediction program, DISOPRED2 [3], together with a domain
identification method. In 401 human TFs, the residuewise fractions of structural domains and ID regions were
found to be 31% and 49%, respectively, with the remain-

ing 20% left unclassified. As some of the unclassified
regions were long, they can possibly contain new structural domains[31]. Others showed mosaic patterns consisting of short ID and unclassified regions.
Besides the skewed amino acid composition, ID regions
are characterized by higher sequence divergence as compared to structural domains. It is known that structural
domains are well conserved through evolution and can be
detected by homology search methods even across different kingdoms (prokaryotes and eukaryotes, for example)
[32,33]. Sequence conservation has been used as a factor
to discriminate structural domains from domain-linkers
[34,35]. By contrast the sequences of ID regions generally
mutate more rapidly than structural regions, although
some exceptions were found [36]. Presumably because ID
regions are not structurally constrained [20], frequent
indels (insertions/deletions), un-aligned sites, and amino
acid substitutions occur in ID sequences. It is common
that BLAST searches using human proteins as queries
detect homology in ID regions in mammalian proteins,
but in a very small number of invertebrate proteins, and
in none of the other more remote species, although
homology in structural domains is generally detectable
beyond invertebrates.
In the present study, we developed a program to CLAssify
DIsorder regions and STructural domains, CLADIST,
incorporating information of un-aligned sites into amino
acid composition. We developed a combined system that
uses structural domain identification, disorder prediction,
and the CLADIST program to make order/disorder assignments to the entire length of proteins. We found that our
system, DICHOT, divides proteins into structural
domains and ID regions highly accurately. Application of
the system to human TFs identifies ID regions and structural domains, including a number of cryptic structural
domains.

Results
Utilization of sequence conservation in structure/disorder
classification
Figure 1 presents the human androgen receptor (hAR) as
an example of the absence of BLAST alignment in the ID
regions. The C-terminal half composed of a DBD and a
ligand binding domain (LBD) [37,38] is well conserved.
By contrast, the N-terminal half, containing the functional
region, AF1, and is mainly composed of ID regions [9,13],
is so diverged that the alignments over entire length is
possible only among mammalian orthologues (the topmost 13 homologues in the figure). Homology was
detected by BLAST only in the C-terminal half even in the
human paralogues, the progesterone/glucocorticoid
receptors. As this example illustrates, a difference in

sequence divergence between structural domains and ID
regions exists, which can be exploited in classification.
We thus developed the CLADIST program that uses the
amino acid composition considering information of
highly divergent sequences in ID regions to divide the
entire proteins into structural domains and ID regions.
The program treats alignment gaps and un-aligned
regions as the 21st element of amino acid composition
and uses support vector machine for classification (for
details, see Materials and Methods).
We tested the accuracy of the CLADIST program in classifying proteins into structural domains and ID regions.
CLADIST was applied to a set of 58 proteins with experimentally verified ID regions selected from the DisProt
database [39] (see Materials and Methods). Table 1 shows
benchmark tests performed in 4-fold validation test. In
test 1, all BLAST homologues with e-value less than 10-3
were used for estimation of the local amino acid composition. 92.4% of the residues were correctly assigned to
either structural domains or ID regions. In order to examine the cases in which only close homologues of a query
are available, we only took BLAST homologues with evalue less than 10-100 to perform test 2. In this test, the percentage of correctly assigned residues dropped to 86.1%
(Table 1). This test simulates cases of lineage-specific proteins, with only closely related homologues whose entire
lengths including ID regions are aligned by BLAST. In such
cases, sequence divergence cannot be effectively utilized
for classification, leaving the local amino acid composition (with few gaps) as the sole factor to rely on. In other
words, the factor of sequence divergence with incorporation of alignment gaps increases the accuracy by more
than 6%.
The DICHOT system
From the result above, we reasoned that combining accurate structural domain assignment by profile methods,

DISOPRED2 prediction, and the CLADIST classification
program could lead to a complete assignment of protein
molecules into structural domains and ID regions with
high accuracy (see Materials and Methods for detail). We
built the DICHOT system by giving the first priority to
trans-membrane (TM) domains and structural domains
assigned by alignments to PDB sequences, then to ID
regions predicted by DISOPRED2, and finally to both
structural domains and ID regions assigned by CLADIST.
In four steps, DICHOT classifies the entire sequence of a
query into structural domains and ID regions. Structural
domains consist of "known domains", i.e., structural
domains with similarity to known 3D structures, and
"cryptic domains" signifying structural domains without
similarity to known 3D structures.
A flow chart of the DICHOT system is presented in Figure
2 together with region assignment steps of a hypothetical
protein, in which the tentative status after each step is
shown in the status box. In the first step, a homology
search against the PDB sequences (SD search in the figure), trans-membrane (TM) assignments, DISOPRED2
prediction, and CLADIST prediction are carried out. The
assignment of known domains is firstly carried out in step
2 (the red bars in the status box). The ID regions predicted
by DISOPRED2 and CLADIST are also accepted, when
they lie outside of the known domains (the gray bars).
DICHOT employs length cutoffs for known and cryptic
domains. The hatched boxes in step 2 are regions that fall
below the length cutoffs, and are assessed by referring to
the SD search and CLADIST results in steps 3 and 4. In this
case, the left-most hatched box is classified as a cryptic
domain, because it lies outside of any of the known
domains, while the other two hatched boxes are not so
classified because they are judged unqualified in step 3
(see Materials and Methods for details). Any query
sequence is thereby entirely classified into two categories,
structural domains consisting of known and cryptic
domains, and ID regions (the last status box).
Application of the DICHOT system to the above-mentioned test data showed that the accuracy increases to
97.7% (Test 3 in Table 1). The increase of accuracy can be
attributed to the following two factors. First, prediction
error in structural domains can be reduced by the accurate
domain assignments by the homology searches against
PDB, which are not included in CLADIST but in DICHOT.
Second, prediction error in ID regions can be reduced by
taking the intersection of the ID regions obtained by
CLADIST and DISOPRED2. Therefore the combined system was effective in improving the reliability of assignments. If used alone, CLADIST misclassifies some residues
in structural domains into ID regions. On the other hand
the DICHOT system gives highly accurate structural

domain assignments with the employment of profile
methods, resulting in the increase in accuracy.
Application of DICHOT to human transcription factors
The DICHOT system was applied to a set of 401 human
TFs to classify each protein into structural domains and ID
regions. Out of a total of 219,628 residues, 33.5% were
classified as known structural domains, 4.0% as cryptic
structural domains, and 62.5% as ID regions (Fig. 3a).
Compared to the previous results (31% known structural
domains, 49% ID regions, and 20% unassigned), the fractions of structural domains and ID regions both increased

significantly. The fractional increase in known structural
domains (from 31% to 33.5%) is attributable to the
increase in 3D structural data in PDB over the previous
study. For comparison, DICHOT was also applied to 229
TFs from E. coli (Fig. 3a): 83.4%, 11.8%, and 4.8% of the
residues fell on known structural domains, cryptic structural domains, and ID regions, respectively. There is a
clear difference between human and E. coli TFs: unlike
human TFs, E. coli TFs consist almost entirely of structural
domains, with a small fraction of ID regions corresponding to relatively short linkers connecting structural
domains and/or terminal tails.

Figure 3b presents the fractions of structural domains and
ID regions in human TFs (upper panel) and E. coli TFs
(lower panel) in a different format. For example, the tallest bar in the upper panel indicates that between 10 and
20% of the residues in 91 human TFs were in structural
domains, or, equivalently between 80 and 90% were in ID
regions. The cumulative graph shows that 60% of the
human TFs have less than 40% of the residues in structural domains, in other words, have more than 60% in ID
regions. In contrast, in most E. coli TFs structural domains
account for more than 90% of their lengths and long ID
regions are absent.
Cryptic structural domains were found in 53 human TFs
(see Additional file 1). Although the 3D structures of cryptic structural domains remain undetermined and cannot
be inferred by homology search methods, functional roles
have been experimentally assigned to some of them. Figure 4 shows two examples of such cases.
A cryptic structural domain predicted in the MHC class II
regulatory factor, RFX1 (conserved regions B, C, and D in
Fig. 4a), has been found to mediate dimerization and
transcriptional repression [40]. Human RFX1, 2, and 3
that bind DNA as homo- or hetero-dimeric complexes
possess highly conserved B-C-D regions, to which the
domain responsible for dimerization has been mapped
[41,42].
The four cryptic structural domains at the C-terminus of
the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1a, SREBP1a, correspond to the regulatory domain [43,44] as a
whole (Fig. 4b). We cannot determine the exact number
of structural domains, because the DICHOT system is not
accurate enough to definitively delimit cryptic structural
domains. SREBP-1a has two transmembrane helices in the
middle (blue regions in Fig. 4b) and has both the N- and
C-terminal regions in the cytoplasm. Upon binding of the
C-terminal regulatory domain to SREBP-cleavage activating protein (SCAP), the N-terminal side of the protein is
known to be cleaved off by specific proteases and be transported to the nucleus to act as a transcription activator
[45].
All the results of the present study obtained by the
DICHOT system can be retrieved at http://
spock.genes.nig.ac.jp/~genome/human_tf/.
Comparison with the previous study
Figure 4 also presents structural domains and ID regions
assigned in the previous study (rectangles without black
rims) (Minezaki et al. 2006). Notable differences between
the present and previous assignments exist in p53 tumor
suppressor (Fig. 4c). p53 has four functional regions, the
acidic TAD at the N-terminus (TA), DBD, the oligomeriza-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/26

tion domain (Oligo), and the C-terminal negative regulatory domain (CNR). While DBD and Oligo were
identified as structural domains as before, the present
study departs from the previous one in assigning TA and
CNR as ID regions. The finding of the present study is consistent with results of NMR experiments in which both TA
and CNR fragments were revealed to be unstructured in
free forms but become structured upon binding to partners: MDM2 in the case of TA [11,12,14] and S100B(bb)
in the case of CNR [17]. Both complexes were co-crystallized and the 3D structures of the co-crystals were determined. The active form of p53 is a homotetramer
resulting from dimerization of dimers [46] through the
Oligo domain, which belongs to the all-Î± fold with fourhelical bundles [46].
Hypoxia inducible factor 1Î± (HIF-1Î±) is composed of
DBD (HLH), two PAS domains, an oxygen-dependent
degradation domain (ODD), and two TADs termed NTAD and C-TAD (Fig. 4d). Although C-TAD was considered to be a structural domain in the previous study
because it becomes structured upon binding to the partner protein, an NMR study has revealed that the C-TAD
fragment is unstructured in the unbound state [47,48].
Thus, the region should be classified as predicted in the
present study. Similarly, N-TAD and ODD, both of which
are unstructured unless bound to their partner proteins
[49], should be classified as ID regions, as correctly done
in this study.

Discussion
A natural first step in analyzing the molecular architecture
of proteins with ID regions is an accurate classification
into structural domains and ID regions. For the dichotomic purpose, we have developed the DICHOT system,
which combines existing methods of domain identification and disorder prediction with CLADIST, a newly
developed classification program. The most reliable
among the components is the identification methods
that, along the sequence of a query protein, locate structural domains homologous to data compiled in SCOP
and/or PDB. DICHOT identifies known domains by this
method first and divides the remainder into structural
domains and ID regions by a combination of the
DISOPRED2 and CLADIST programs. The resolving
power largely depends on the number of homologues
available. The CLADIST program, in which the effect of
sequence conservation is incorporated through local
amino acid composition, maintains high accuracy even in
cases in which only a limited number of homologues are
available (Table 1).
The application of DICHOT to TFs has revealed that the
fraction of structural domains is only 38% in human TFs,
while that in E. coli TFs is as high as 95% (Fig. 3a). At the

same time, DICHOT uncovered cryptic structural
domains in 4% and 12% of the residues of human and E.
coli TFs, respectively (Fig. 3a). We believe that the cryptic
structural domains serve as good targets of structural
genomics research. The smaller fraction of cryptic structural domains in human TFs than in E. coli TFs may reflect
the more experimental research carried out on the former
than the latter. Rapid increase of structural data in the
PDB is expected to convert cryptic structural domains into
known structural domains. In fact, besides RFX1 and
SRBP-1a in Figure 3, transcription factor E2F1 was
regarded as a good example of a structural domain whose
structure had not been determined but with known function in the previous study [9], but the domain was
assigned as a known structural domain in the present
study, because the X-ray structure of the dimerization
domain of E2F-1 had been solved in the meantime [50].
This conversion applies not only to E2F-1, but also to all
members of the human E2F family[51]: E2F1-6 and DP1,
2. That the fraction of cryptic structural domains detected
in this study was rather small indicates that the 3D structures already available include a high fraction of naturally
occurring protein folds.

tions in complex with partner proteins. In this sense, they
are regarded as intrinsically unstructured [4,11-17]. However, TADs have a sequence characteristic different from
that of typical ID regions: they exhibit a significantly
higher propensity to form a-helices and b-strands. Some
attempts have been made to predict protein-protein interaction sites within ID regions based on this difference in
sequence [56,57]. While identification of functional sites
in ID regions is of biological importance, our concern in
the present study was to divide protein molecules completely and accurately into structural domains and ID
regions. Because of the intermediate nature of TADs
between structural domains and ID regions, we paid special attention to distinguish structural domains and TADs:
our system uses the criteria that TADs are shorter in length
and are less conserved among homologues than structural
domains. Even though we set the cut-off value large
enough (50 residues) to cover all known TAD fragments,
our method works well not only for TADs, but also for
short SDs: many DBDs of less than 50 residues were correctly classified as SDs. As a result, the TADs erroneously
assigned as structural domains in the previous study were
reclassified as ID regions (Fig. 4).

Cryptic structural domains were sometimes supported by
the presence of Pfam domains in the same regions. However, we chose not to utilize Pfam for detection of structural domains, because some Pfam domains exist within
ID regions [52,53]. For instance, the Pfam domain,
PF02166, resides within the N-terminal side of the androgen receptor (Fig. 1), which is unstructured when not
bound to the cognate protein as observed by spectroscopic measurements [13]. This happens presumably
because a Pfam domain is defined for a sequence pattern
conserved within a number of proteins, irrespective of the
presence or absence of a globular structure [54,55]. It may
apparently look contradictory that a Pfam domain is
assigned to the N-terminal part of androgen receptor due
to high sequence conservation on one hand, while on the
other hand an ID region was assigned to the same region
by our system due to high sequence divergence. However,
there is no inconsistency because the N-terminal sequence
is conserved only within homologues of phylogenetically
close species as mentioned before, while the C-terminal
sequence is conserved over more remote homologues
(Fig. 1), and the poorer sequence conservation relative to
the C-terminus is symptomatic of the existence of an ID
region at the N-terminus.

Conclusion

Distinction of whether or not a globular structure is
formed is crucial in the classification of the region into a
structural domain or an ID region. Protein-protein interaction sites including TADs, located in the middle of long
stretches of ID regions, are unstructured in the isolated
state, even though they transiently adopt fixed configura-

We developed the system DICHOT to completely divide
proteins into structural and un-structural regions. The system includes structural assignments by homology
searches, and the DISOPRED2 program as well as the new
program CLADIST for ID region prediction. CLADIST
takes un-aligned regions into consideration to enable
DICHOT to divide entire amino acid sequences into structural/un-structural regions. The resulting classification of
protein molecules was shown to be highly reliable. As a
natural extension, we will apply the method to all human
proteins. The research will provide an accurate ratio of
structural domains to ID regions. Moreover, it is expected
to uncover a number of cryptic structural domains in
human proteins, which, because of the high degree of reliability, may become targets of structural study.

Methods
CLADIST, a in-house program for CLAssifying intrinsically
DIsorder regions and STructural domains
We developed a program, CLADIST, for classifying intrinsically disorder regions and structural domains. CLADIST
utilizes information of ID regions of a query sequence that
cannot be BLAST-aligned with those in homologs even if
structural domains are aligned. Figure 1 schematically
shows a multiple alignment based on a BLAST search,
where the solid and dotted lines represent the aligned and
unaligned regions, respectively. We created multiple
alignments based on segmental BLAST alignments in
order to estimate local amino acid compositions. CLADIST uses the amino acid composition of the 21-residue

window centered at each residue site of a query sequence.
The local amino acid composition within the window was
quantified taking all residues and gaps in the multiple
alignments into account, with gaps treated as the 21st element. Here, we regard unaligned sites marked by dotted
lines in Figure 1 as 'gaps' as well, in order to incorporate
the information of unaligned regions. It follows that the
local composition of a residue within a structural domain
is expected to contain only a small number of gaps, i.e., a
large number of similar sequences, whereas that of a residue within an ID region is likely to have a large number
of gaps, i.e., a small number of similar sequences. After
the above-described procedures, a 21-dimensional vector
(20 dimensions for amino acids, one dimension for gaps)
is assigned to each site in a query and is used for classification of the residue into structural domains and ID
regions. The CLADIST program was equipped with support vector machines in the statistical package R http://
www.r-project.org/index.html.
We used the DisProt [39] database to train and test the
CLADIST program. From DisProt, we selected 58 proteins
that have at least one structural domain and one ID region
longer than 30 residues, and that belong to the four representative eukaryotes: human, mouse, rat, and yeast. Structural domains were assigned by reverse PSI-BLAST
searches against the PDB with the e-value cutoff of 1.0 Ã
10-3. The total numbers of sites in structural domains and
ID regions are 3,746 and 1,497, respectively. All the sites
were divided into 4 sections by generating random numbers. The training was conducted using 3 sections, with
the remaining section utilized as the test data set. This procedure was repeated four times with different sets assigned
as the test data set, and the average was calculated. For
each query protein in the training data sets, BLAST
searches were conducted against a genome database containing proteins from 621 organisms, with low-complexity regions in the database sequences and the query
masked by SEG [58]. The redundancy of the genome
sequences was reduced with a 90% identity cutoff.
Aligned sequences with the e-values less than 1.0 Ã 10-3
were accepted as homologues. Before quantification of
amino acid composition, masked regions were replaced
by the original sequences.
The DICHOT system to divide proteins into structural
domains and ID regions
The DICHOT system was constructed by combining three
methods of structural domain identification, disorder prediction by DISOPRED2, and classification by the CLADIST program. Figure 2 shows a flow chart of the DICHOT
system together with the results of homology searches and
ID predictions illustrated in the upper half, together with
the status boxes showing the assigned regions after each
step.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/9/26

In step 1, we conducted structural domain (SD) searches,
i.e. BLAST and reverse PSI-BLAST searches against the PDB
(Apr. 6, 2007 version) and SCOP [49] (version 1.69) and
HMMER searches against SCOP. Because the assignments
of structural domains above are conducted and stored in
the GTOP database[59,60] in a genome-wide scale, we
took analyzed data, including DISOPRED2 prediction [3],
from GTOP. Trans-membrane (TM) regions were assigned
according to the Swiss-Prot annotations, and the CLADIST
program was run on all query sequences. The bar diagrams in the top-most four rows show the search results of
a hypothetical protein.
In step 2, the DICHOT system accepts the search results in
step 1 in the following descending order: the structural
domain searches including TM, DISOPRED2, and CLADIST. For structural domain assignments based on SD
searches, we specify the following conditions. The e-value
cutoff of was set at 1.0 Ã 10-3 except for the special cases
described below, and if multiple hits of the same region
were obtained, the best hit was chosen in the following
descending order: BLAST against the PDB, reverse PSIBLAST against the PDB, reverse PSI-BLAST against SCOP,
and HMMER against SCOP. We chose this ordering
because the profile methods such as PSI-BLAST and
HMMER tend to provide elongated alignments resulting
from over-assignment of regions flanking genuine ones.
Although the e-value cutoff was generally set at 1.0 Ã 10-3,
we found many HMMER hits with larger e-values to be
true hits in the case of zinc-finger domains. Thus, we
adopted a less stringent cutoff e-value of 1 for zinc fingers
in HMMER searches.
The lengths of the structural regions selected by the above
criteria were checked and the regions longer than or equal
to 50 residues were accepted as known domains (red
boxes). This length criterion was adopted by assessing the
lengths of known TAD fragments. For the shorter regions,
the SCOP classification of aligned domains was examined
and those aligned to the SCOP structural domains of
classes from 'a' (all-Î±), 'b' (all-Î²), 'c' (Î±/Î²), 'd' (Î±+Î²), 'e'
(multidomain), 'f' (membrane), and 'g' (small), but not
'h' (coiled coil), 'i' (low resolution protein structure), and
'j' (peptide) were classified as known domains. As SCOP
domains of classes h and j, as found in synuclein [61] and
a p53 fragment [62] among others, do not adopt globular
structures, they are classified as IDs. In the status box, the
right green section of SD searches is assigned as a known
domain, while the left one is left unclassified at this stage
(hatched rectangle) because the domain is shorter than 50
residues and does not belong to any of the SCOP domains
of classes a to g.
A structural domain predicted by CLADIST is not accepted
if more than half of the region overlaps with structural

domains assigned by SD searches. Out of the two structural domains predicted by CLADIST (yellowish green
bars), the right one was neglected because a majority of
the region overlaps with the structural domains assigned
by SD searches. DICHOT admits all ID regions predicted
by DISOPRED2 and CLADIST if they fall outside of structural domains assigned by SD searches. If ID regions predicted by DISOPRED2 overlap with the structural
domains predicted by CLADIST, they are classified as ID
regions. Due to interruption by an ID region, the left structural domain predicted by CLADIST (yellowish green bar)
is divided into two enclaves (hatched boxes), both of
which await classification in later steps.
In step 3, DICHOT examines the short structural domains
left unclassified in step 2. A short structural domain found
to coincide with a structural domain predicted by CLADIST is regarded as a known domain. Otherwise, it is classified as an ID region, as in the case of the right-most
hatched rectangle in step 2. This additional requirement
for short structural domain was introduced to prevent
functional sites in ID regions from erroneously assigned
as structural domains. For example, the 3D structures of
TADs complexed with partner proteins have been determined and registered in the PDB. As they are classified as
ID regions by the CLADIST program, they are correctly
classified as ID regions by this step. Structural domains
predicted by CLADIST whose lengths are longer than or
equal to 30 amino acid residues are considered as candidates for cryptic domains. The middle hatched box in step
2 is shorter than 30 residues and therefore discarded at
this step, while the left-most one is long enough to be left
as a cryptic domain candidate.
In the fourth and final step, overlaps of cryptic domain
candidates with known domains are checked. This step is
necessary because some known domains arise at step 3
and they had not been subjected to the overlap check at
step 2. If less than half of the regions overlap with any of
the known domains, the regions are classified as cryptic
domains (orange region). Any query sequence is thereby
entirely classified into two categories, i.e., structural
domains consisting of known and cryptic domains, and
ID regions.
Datasets
The dataset of 401 human TFs used in the present study is
identical to that in the previous study [9]: data having
direct experimental evidence in the Swiss-Prot database
[63] (version 52.1) were collected, from which general
transcription factors like TFIIB, TBP (TATA-box binding
protein) and various co-acting factors involved in the
transcription complex were removed. 229 E. coli TFs were
taken
from
the
