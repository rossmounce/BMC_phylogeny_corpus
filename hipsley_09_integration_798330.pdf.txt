Abstract
Background: Although current molecular clock methods offer greater flexibility in modelling
evolutionary events, calibration of the clock with dates from the fossil record is still problematic
for many groups. Here we implement several new approaches in molecular dating to estimate the
evolutionary ages of Lacertidae, an Old World family of lizards with a poor fossil record and
uncertain phylogeny. Four different models of rate variation are tested in a new program for
Bayesian phylogenetic analysis called TreeTime, based on a combination of mitochondrial and
nuclear gene sequences. We incorporate paleontological uncertainty into divergence estimates by
expressing multiple calibration dates as a range of probabilistic distributions. We also test the
reliability of our proposed calibrations by exploring effects of individual priors on posterior
estimates.
Results: According to the most reliable model, as indicated by Bayes factor comparison, modern
lacertids arose shortly after the K/T transition and entered Africa about 45 million years ago, with
the majority of their African radiation occurring in the Eocene and Oligocene. Our findings indicate
much earlier origins for these clades than previously reported, and we discuss our results in light
of paleogeographic trends during the Cenozoic.
Conclusion: This study represents the first attempt to estimate evolutionary ages of a specific
group of reptiles exhibiting uncertain phylogenetic relationships, molecular rate variation and a
poor fossil record. Our results emphasize the sensitivity of molecular divergence dates to fossil
calibrations, and support the use of combined molecular data sets and multiple, well-spaced dates
from the fossil record as minimum node constraints. The bioinformatics program used here,
TreeTime, is publicly available, and we recommend its use for molecular dating of taxa faced with
similar challenges.

Background
The molecular clock [1] has become an increasingly common tool among biologists for dating the origins of species or lineages using genetic sequence data. This is
commonly done by measuring the genetic distance
between two species and, assuming mutations occur at a
constant rate, applying an external calibration to convert
those distances into geological time (for a review of
molecular clock methods, see [2]). Despite its widespread
application, calibration of the clock using independent
evidence, typically derived from the fossil record, is still
problematic for many groups. While proper calibration
dates for major evolutionary events like the mammal-bird
or fish-tetrapod split are under constant debate [3-6], less
attention has been given to smaller, less inclusive clades,
which often have poor fossil records. Such discussions
would be particularly useful for evolutionary biologists
since it is often these clades that are the subject of more
detailed investigations, e.g. in the context of biogeography
or diversification. In the present study, we investigate how
molecular divergences can be estimated in the absence of
a good fossil record, and how fossil calibrations should be
applied in such a case.
Here we combine a number of new approaches in molecular dating to assign evolutionary ages to the Old World
lizard family Lacertidae (Squamata). Lacertidae, with
about 280 species [7], is the dominant reptile group in
Europe and a substantial component of the squamate reptile diversity in Africa. The family is divided into two subfamilies, the Gallotiinae and Lacertinae, with the latter
group composed of two monophyletic clades, the mainly
Palearctic Lacertini and Eremiadini of Africa (see [7] for a
review of lacertid systematics). Compared to their Eurasian sister taxa, the African radiation shows extraordinary
taxic diversity in desert habitats, while mesic-adapted genera in Africa are relatively species-poor. This disparity in
species richness is surprising given that desert lacertids are
considered evolutionarily younger and therefore have had
less time to speciate than their mesic sister taxa, suggesting
increased speciation rates in xeric habitat. Testing this
hypothesis, however, has been difficult due to our lack of
knowledge on the relative antiquity of desert clades. Terrestrial squamate fossils from the Cenozoic of Africa are
rare [8], and this lack of fossil material has seriously hampered our ability to date the main lacertid lineages – a key
step towards uncovering the ecological and evolutionary
factors shaping their unique biogeographic patterns.
Based on previous molecular clock estimates, lacertids
may have entered Africa (and at the same time split from
the Palearctic clade) after Eurasia contacted Africa in the
Neogene, some 17–19 million years ago (Mya) [7]. Fluctuating climatic conditions and aridification during that
time may have promoted speciation in African lacertids

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/151

through ecological displacement. According to Arnold
[9], competitive interactions among species in mesic habitats forced subordinate taxa into drier, heterogeneous
areas, resulting in niche divergence and diversification.
However, a fundamental problem with this hypothesis is
that other molecular divergence studies [e.g. [10,11]] have
estimated a much older age for crown (and African) lacertids, pushing their origin far into the early Cenozoic. Furthermore, dates given by Arnold et al. [7] are largely based
on Carranza et al. [12], which in contrast to other molecular clock studies relies on only a single calibration point
for their estimates (the age of the Canary island El Hierro
to calibrate the node between Gallotia caesaris caesaris and
G. c. gomerensis). In addition, both of the above studies
rely on the method of nonparametric rate smoothing [13]
which may not properly account for rate variation as it has
a tendency to overfit data, particularly for regions of the
tree with short branches [14]. Therefore, thoroughly performed divergence estimates for Lacertidae, particularly
for the African radiation, are still needed.
In this article, we estimate evolutionary relationships and
divergence dates for the major lineages of Lacertidae with
the goal of forming biogeographical hypotheses for their
origin and subsequent spread throughout Africa. We construct a molecular phylogeny for the family using published nuclear and mitochondrial gene sequences, which
for the first time are combined in a total evidence
approach. We use multiple, well-spaced dates from fossil
taxa within and outside of the family as independent calibrations. To account for uncertainty in paleontological
dates we use flexible priors, meaning that calibrations are
expressed as probabilistic distributions with minimum
and maximum bounds [15,16]. The use of "soft" bounds
is advantageous over simple point calibrations, as potential errors in fossil dating and identification, as well as the
lag time between speciation and appearance of a fossil
descendent, are statistically incorporated into the prior
distribution [15-17]. Additionally, we test the reliability
of our proposed calibrations by excluding individual priors and evaluating posterior estimates.
All molecular clock analyses are performed in a newly
available software application for Bayesian analysis called
TreeTime [18]. Like MrBayes [19] and BEAST [20], TreeTime uses a Metropolis-Coupled Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMCMC) method for Bayesian phylogenetic
sampling. TreeTime simultaneously estimates tree topology and diversification dates and therefore does not
require a starting tree topology, making it particularly
appropriate for groups with uncertain phylogenies. Prior
information on tree topology can be input by specifying
two taxa, A and B, so that only trees in which at least one
branch separates A from B are permitted. The user can also
specify differently distributed priors for the time of the

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:151

split between A and B. Within TreeTime, we implement
four different models of rate variation and compare their
performance using Bayes factor analysis. Phylogenetic
relationships among the different genera are compared to
previous studies, and age estimates from the different
models are evaluated against available data from geology,
climatology and the fossil record. Finally, we use our
results as a platform for evaluating alternative hypotheses
for the origins of Lacertidae and interpret our findings in
light of paleogeographic trends in the Cenozoic.

Methods
Taxon sampling and alignment
Thirty-five species, representing 33 of 41 currently recognized genera, were used to construct a molecular phylogeny for the main lineages of Lacertidae. Partial DNA
sequences of 3 mitochondrial genes (12S, 16S and Cytb)
and 2 nuclear genes (Rag-1 and C-mos) were retrieved
from GenBank. Most lacertid genera are represented by a
single species, with the exception of Psammodromus and
Mesalina, which are each represented by two. All genes
used in this study were not available for some of the species, so that six of the genera (Acanthodactylus, Algyroides,
Eremias, Nucras, Parvilacerta and Pedioplanis) are represented by a combination of genes from two congeneric
species. For example, the missing Cytb sequence of Acanthodactylus boskianus is substituted by that of A. erythrurus.
Such substitutions at the genus level should have no effect
on overall tree topology, since we are primarily interested
in phylogenetic relationships of higher taxonomic units
(i.e. above the generic level). The final data set for Lacertidae consists of 3 individuals from the subfamily Gallotinae (Gallotia + Psammodromus), 15 individuals from
Eremiadini corresponding to 14 genera, and 17 individuals from Lacertini each representing a single genus. Three
additional species were used as outgroups: the teiid Cnemidophorus tigris, the amphisbaenian Rhineura floridana,
and one of two living members of Rhynchocephalia, Sphenodon punctatus, as outgroup to all squamates. GenBank
accession numbers for sequence data are listed in Table 1.
Lacertid taxonomy follows Arnold et al. [7].

Alignments were performed separately for each gene using
ClustalW [21] and manually corrected in SEAVIEW [22].
A total of 15–20 base pairs (bp) of 16S that could not be
aligned unambiguously were excluded from the analysis.
Final gene lengths are 254 bp 16S, 327 bp 12S, 281 bp
Cytb, 1012 bp Rag-1 and 375 bp C-mos. To test for incongruence among genes, a partition homogeneity test [23]
was conducted in PAUP* 4.0b10 [24]. The test (100 replicates of random addition heuristic search option with
tree-bisection-reconnection branch swapping) indicated
significant heterogeneity among genes (p = 0.01). However, since a growing number of studies indicate that
incongruence tests are not reliable indicators of data set

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/151

combinability [25] and no strongly supported nodes were
in conflict with previous studies, genes were concatenated
into a multigene data set of 2249 bp. Following a total evidence approach [26], the following analyses were conducted on the combined data to maximize the amount of
characters and explanatory power of the available data. As
a test of our combined approach, we also analyzed partitioned mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA
(nDNA) sequences for one of the relaxed clock models
(Uncorrelated lognormal with 10% prior probability distributions, described below). These values were then compared to results from the concatenated data set to explore
possible biases associated with the different genomes.
Phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses
Divergence dates for Lacertidae were estimated under four
different Bayesian molecular clock models. Minimum
constraints for five nodes were chosen based on evidence
from the fossil record. In a conservative approach, the oldest age of the stratigraphic layer in which a fossil was
found was used to represent the earliest occurrence of that
lineage, and potential calibrations were limited to fossils
that are reliably assigned to extant clades. Calibrated
nodes are: (i) Sphenodon punctatus – Cnemidophorus tigris,
228.0 Mya, based on the earliest identified rhynchocephalian from the late Triassic [Carnian; [27]], and
corroborated by the oldest-known fossil squamate, Tikiguania, from the Carnian of India [28], (ii) Cnemidophorus
tigris – Rhineura floridana, 113.0 Mya, corresponding to
the oldest known teiid, Ptilotodon, from the lower Cretaceous [Aptian-Albian; [29]], (iii) Rhineura floridana – Gallotia galloti, 64.2 Mya, based on the fossil rhineurid
Plesiorhineura from the Paleocene [Torrejonian; [30]], and
(iv) Timon lepidus – Dalmatolacerta oxycephala, 5.3 Mya
based on the Pliocene "Lacerta ruscinensis" from Roussillon, France, whose fossil remains are indistinguishable
from the modern T. lepidus presently living in the same
area [31].

To incorporate uncertainty surrounding fossil calibrations, prior constraints are expressed as probability based
distributions. We use a rigid, or "hard", minimum bound,
meaning that the true divergence date cannot be younger
than the earliest known fossil. The probability that the
divergence event occurred above the minimum date
declines according to an exponential distribution, such
that 95% of the posterior density falls within the range [x
- x + 10%] (Figure 1). For example, the minimum age constraint for the split between Rhynchocephalia and Squamata is 228 Mya, and the expected posterior estimate is
between 228.0 and 239.4. To test the sensitivity of posterior estimates to prior distributions, we also allow expectancy values for calibrated nodes to fall within 20% of the
minimum age, so that 95% of the posterior density is
between [x - x + 20%]. This allows us to evaluate the influ-

ence of the range of soft bounds used for a given data set,
irrespective of possible errors in fossil calibration dates.
In addition to estimating divergence dates, we evaluate
the reliability of our proposed fossil calibrations by systematically removing individual priors and comparing
posterior estimates. Specifically, we test the accuracy of
the dates proposed for amphisbaenians (Plesiorhineura,
64.2 Mya) and teiids (Ptilotodon, 113.0 Mya) using three
different treatments. In the first treatment, both the

amphisbaenian and teiid are excluded so that only the
oldest date (Rhynchocephalia, 228 Mya) and youngest
date (Lacerta ruscinensis, 5.3 Mya) remain. In the second
and third treatments, only the amphisbaenian or teiid is
removed, respectively. If a calibration is accurate, provided the remaining calibrations are reliable and the data
and model are appropriate, the posterior estimate should
remain within the prior range even in the absence of the
fossil constraint. If the calibration is poor, the posterior
should move away from the prior [32]. This approach also

ULN: Uncorrelated lognormal distributed model of
Drummond et al. [16], in which the evolutionary rate of
each branch is independently drawn from a lognormal
distribution. There is no autocorrelation of rates between
neighbouring branches. Parameters within the model
determine the expectancy value and variance of rates. A
smaller variance indicates a smaller deviation from the
strict molecular clock, since rates of change are similar
across branches.

allows us to compare our results with other studies using
similar combinations of fossil calibrations to date the origins of squamate groups [see [10,11]].
For nucleotide data, all models are nested in the General
Time Reversible model of sequence evolution with a proportion of invariant sites and gamma distributed rate heterogeneity (GTR+I+Γ), as determined by jModelTest 0.1.1
[33,34]. For each analysis, the MCMC was run for
50,500,000 steps each chain and sampled every 500,000
steps. The first 1,000,000 steps of each run were discarded
as burnin. To couple the four parallel chains we used a
heating coefficient of 0.3. This resulted in a sample of size
of 100 from the posterior distribution, taken from the
cold chain.
MCMC calculations were performed in the program TreeTime, freely available at http://www.zi.biologie.unimuenchen.de/evol/statgen/software/treetime[18]. Within
that program, the following models were implemented:
MC: Strict molecular clock model [1], assumes a fixed rate
of evolution along all branches of the tree.
CPP: Compound Poisson Process [35], in which points of
rate change are interspersed along branches. Following
each substitution event, the current rate is modified
according to a Poisson process with an adaptive intensity,
which determines the a priori distribution of the number
of changes. Rate modulations are gamma distributed,
such that the expectancy value of the product of multiple
rate changes is equal to 1.

DM: Dirichlet model [36]. The a priori distribution of evolutionary rates at the branches follows a dirichlet distribution. Parameters within the model determine the variance
of rates. The smaller the variance, the smaller the deviation from a strict molecular clock. The average evolutionary rate across branches is kept constant, so that only
relative differences between rates are considered.
As an independent evaluation of our results, we also calculate divergence dates for Lacertidae under the ULN
model in BEAST [20], an alternative program for Bayesian
analysis. Identical model parameters were used in the two
programs with the following exceptions: 1) In addition to
priors for calibrated nodes, BEAST requires a prior for the
distribution of divergence dates, for which we chose the
Yule process. 2) BEAST estimates the equilibrium distribution of nucleotides only once at the beginning of the analysis, TreeTime samples these estimates continuously. 3) In
BEAST the molecular clock is relaxed by varying molecular
rates of the substitution model among branches, for
which reason the rates are dependent on the time scale of
the tree. TreeTime compresses or stretches the lengths of
branches in the tree, given in molecular time units, by rate
multipliers with a mean of one.
Finally, we test the performance of alternative clock relaxations on our data by computing Bayes factors, a Bayesian
alternative to likelihood ratio tests. Bayes factors calculate
the ratio of marginal likelihoods between two given models by integrating over all possible parameter values (as
opposed to estimating the maximum likelihood for each
parameter). In a comparison between models M1 and M2,
a Bayes factor >10 on a logarithmic scale indicates that M1
is more strongly supported by the data under consideration than M2 [37]. A significant advantage of Bayes factors
over likelihood ratio tests is that they automatically penalize models with increasing complexity, and thus guard
against overfitting. Furthermore, by using the strict molecular clock as a reference, they allow for a general comparison among any number of independent models [38].

Results
Phylogenetic analysis of the combined genetic data recovers the major lineages of Lacertidae in accordance with
previous studies [e.g. [7,39]]. The subfamily Gallotinae

Page 5 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:151

appears most basal and is sister to Lacertinae, which contains the subclades Lacertini and Eremiadini. In all cases
the amphisbaenian Rhineura floridana forms the sister
taxon to Lacertidae, as suggested by previous studies
[10,40]. The four independent Bayesian analyses differed
only slightly in their tree topology, so that only the tree
with the highest posterior probability is shown here (ULN
95% consensus tree, Figure 2).
In all phylogenetic analyses, relationships within Gallotinae were identical, however some differences in tree
topology exist regarding the subfamily Lacertinae. The
Eurasian subclade Lacertini is represented by a comb-like
topology, where generic relationships are largely unresolved. In contrast, the African radiation is split into two
monophyletic groups corresponding to Saharo-Eurasian
and Ethiopian (Africa south of the Sahara Desert) distributions [e.g. [7,39]], with the latter divided into southern
and east African subclades. Phylogenetic resolution is generally higher among African genera, with the only differences between trees limited to the placement of
Acanthodactylus boskianus as sister taxon to Mesalina in all
cases except for the CPP 20% model, and Poromera as outgroup to the inclusive Nucras/Latastia/Heliobolus in all
cases except for the strict molecular clock (MC), where it
instead branches from the base of the Ethiopian clade.
These slight variations in topology have no affect on relationships among the major lineages, so they are not discussed further here. Overall, all trees are essentially in
agreement and in the following discussion we refer to the
single tree shown in Figure 2.
Divergence estimates
Divergence dates for Lacertidae estimated from each of the
molecular clock analyses are listed in Additional file 1:
Lacertid clade ages. For nearly all of the relaxed clock
models, the origin of modern lacertids, as indicated by the
split between Gallotinae and Lacertinae, is estimated to be
in the Paleocene (56–58 Mya), with the initial radiation
of the African clade occurring in the mid-Eocene (44–46
Mya). Within the Eremiadini, the separation of the
Saharo-Eurasian and Ethiopian clades occurred after their
split from the Lacertini, 40–43 Mya. The subfamily Gallotinae diverged into its component genera, Gallotia and
Psammodromus, during the Oligocene, 29–32 Mya.

To assess the relative fitness of the alternative clock relaxations, we calculated Bayes factors between each model
using the strict molecular clock as a reference. Results are
shown in Table 2 on a logarithmic scale. In all comparisons, the strict molecular clock was strongly rejected in
favour of relaxed clock models, with Bayes factors ranging
from -170 to -101. Among the different clock relaxations,
the CPP model performed most poorly and gave considerably younger ages for almost all nodes. The DM and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/151

ULN model received comparable Bayes factors, though
ULN performs slightly better (ln ULN_DM = 24). Taken
together, the relative ordering of MC, CPP, DM, and ULN
indicates that the Uncorrelated lognormal model is most
appropriate for our data set.
In addition to our original divergences calculated with a
10% maximum soft bound, we expanded probability
ranges to within 20% of the minimum date. Doubling
prior bounds increased divergence estimates for all nodes,
as well as widening confidence intervals (Additional file
1). For example, the original bounds for the Amphisbaenia-Lacertidae split were (64.2, 70.6) and the posterior
estimate from to the ULN model was 68.5–83.3 Mya.
When prior bounds were increased to 20%, the prior
range became (64.2, 77) and the posterior estimate
increased to 77.2–100.2 Mya (Additional file 1, node 3).
The smallest changes resulting from this increase occurred
at the Sphenodon-Squamata and Teiidae-Amphisbaenia
nodes, which increased by an average of 3.2% and 7.5%,
respectively. The largest change occurred at the Timon/Dalmatolacerta node, where the divergence date increased by
an average of 43.6% across all models, more than double
that of any other posterior expansion. Effects were most
dramatic in the CPP model, which without exception produced the largest increase in divergence estimates and
standard deviations when prior distributions were
expanded to 20%. However, because the CPP model is
unreliable for our data (see Bayes factors, Table 2), we
ignore these dates in the final discussion.
The BEAST analysis of the combined data resulted in a tree
topology identical to TreeTime, except for the loss of the
Archaeolacerta/Zootoca sister group. Molecular dates were
younger in BEAST for all but one node (Figure 3; Additional file 1, node 19), but still all fall within the 95% confidence intervals produced in TreeTime. The most
significant differences occur at the major lacertid splits
(Additional file 1, nodes 4, 5 and 6), where divergences
occur approximately 10 My later. These changes are most
likely attributed to differences in model parameters and
not performance of the programs themselves. The prior
distribution on branching times used in BEAST, the Yule
Process, has a tendency to pull divergence dates towards
the tips of the tree when basal internodes are short but terminal branches are long. This influence can be even
stronger when rates vary inside the tree, as is most likely
the case in Lacertidae. In TreeTime, prior information on
branching times is applied only to calibrated nodes, and
every allocation of branching times for remaining nodes
in the tree is equally likely. Because of these differences in
program settings, we refer only to the age estimates given
by TreeTime for our discussion.

Partitioned data sets
Phylogenies based on the partitioned mtDNA and nDNA
do not reach a resolution equivalent to the combined data
set, leaving large parts of Eremiadini and Lacertini unresolved. Although we refrained from constraining nodes
prior to the analysis since there is no current consensus on
lacertid ingroup phylogeny, all major nodes were still
recovered. Overall, mtDNA produced older dates when
compared to the nDNA and combined data. Node ages
based on nDNA alone were marginally younger than in
the combined analysis (Figure 4; Additional file 1).
Among the major nodes, dates among the partitioned and
combined data vary little, with the largest difference being
the Amphisbaenia-Lacertidae split. Mean dates for the
major clades, including European and African lacertids,
still remain within the 95% confidence intervals of the
combined data.

Selective deletion of calibration points
Three analyses were run under the ULN model each
excluding one or more fossil priors. In almost all cases,
estimated divergence dates were older and had larger
standard deviations than when all calibrations were used
(Figure 5). The largest changes occurred when both the
amphisbaenian and teiid calibrations were removed. With
the exception of the most recent split (Mesalina guttulata/
Mesalina rubropunctata), divergence estimates became significantly older and standard deviations expanded by 5–
20 My. Excluding the amphisbaenian calibration caused
posterior ranges to increase by up to 30 My. Age increases
were most strongly evident at the origins of the major lineages. Removing the teiid calibration alone had the least
effect on posterior estimates, with a maximum increase of
2 My at all nodes (except for the Teiidae-Amphisbaenia
split itself, which increased by almost 15 My).

Discussion
In general, our results confirm recent molecular based
studies of lacertid phylogeny, including their sister relationship with amphisbaenians. Low taxon sampling
within the subfamily Gallotinae hinders any phylogenetic
interpretations for the group, apart from being a monophyletic clade that forms the outgroup to the remaining
lacertid taxa. The Palearctic clade Lacertini forms a large
polytomy in the strict consensus tree that includes the

Asian grass lizard Takydromus sexlineatus (Figure 2). Relationships among the remaining Palearctic genera are
poorly resolved and are therefore not discussed further
here, though some biogeographical implications for the
clade in general are considered below.
Several well supported sister groups occur within the African subclade Eremiadini (Figure 2). The Saharo-Eurasian
group consists of the mainly North African/Asian genera
Ophisops, Acanthodactylus, Eremias and Mesalina, as well as
the Middle Eastern Omanosaura and equatorial African
genus Adolfus. Within the Ethiopian clade, the taxon pairs
Pedioplanis/Tropidosaura and Meroles/Ichnotropis form a
distinct southern African cluster, while the remaining genera are distributed primarily in east Africa (with the exception of the singular species of Poromera in western central
Africa). The restricted distribution of Poromera in equatorial forests may be the result of high levels of extinction
some time in the past. Indeed, Africa's rainforests have
diminished greatly since the early Cenozoic, and during
the last 30 My a trend toward increasing aridity, coupled
with repeated glacial phases, has left only small remnants
of the once extensive blocks of rainforest [41].

Divergence estimates for Lacertidae and their evolutionary
implications
Mean dates for the origin of Squamata based on the DM
and ULN model (236.9, 238.2 Mya) fall well within estimates given by Vidal and Hedges [10] (221–251 Mya)
based on nine nuclear genes, two of which are included in
the present study. The split between amphisbaenians and
lacertids, on the other hand, is not as well supported.
Although their sister relationship is corroborated under
all models, node ages vary by over 10 My in the 10% and
20% analyses, the latter case placing the split almost 30
My earlier than the earliest known rhineurid. Previous
studies by Vidal and Hedges [10] and Wiens et al. [11] give
much older dates for amphisbaenians, pushing their origin back to the late Jurassic-early Cretaceous. It should be
noted, however, that Wiens et al. [11] use a different date
to calibrate the Amphisbaenia-Lacertidae split based on
an older fossil from the early Cretaceous (98 Mya),
Hodzhakulia magna [42,43]. This specimen consists only
of incomplete maxillaries and dentaries and its purported
amphisbaenian affinities have long been in doubt
[44,45], making it problematic as a calibration point.

Overall, our dates for the origin of modern lacertids are
much earlier than previous estimates, placing them in the
late Paleocene, 58–56 Mya. Within the Lacertidae, the
majority of divergences occur in the mid- to late Eocene
after the Eremiadini split from their palearctic sister clade.
The separation of the African clade into its Saharo-Eurasian and Ethiopian genera occurs shortly after, and they
continue to diversify until well into the mid-Miocene,
some 10 Mya. The relatively young ages of the African lineages are somewhat surprising given the high levels of species richness found in desert clades. Increased rates of
speciation in desert lineages may be due to selection pressures experienced in extreme environments. Adaptations
to xeric habitat favoring 'r-selected' strategies (e.g. reproducing and dying quickly) could promote a shift towards
shortened generation times, thus accelerating diversification [7,46,47]. Unfortunately, very little is known about
the ecology of desert lacertids, making it difficult to determine factors underlying their biogeographic patterns.
However, recent studies indicate that physiological and
life history variables, such as generation time, metabolic
rate, body size and clutch size, influence mutation rates in
terrestrial vertebrates [48,49], and may affect rates of
molecular evolution in reptiles as well [50].
Historical biogeography of Lacertidae
Most authors agree that lacertids originated in Europe, as
indicated by the mainly European distribution of the
basal Gallotinae [7]. According to our most reliable
model (ULN), the majority of the lacertid radiation
occurred in the mid-Eocene, 43–46 Mya. During that
time, Europe was an archipelago of larger and smaller

islands separated by shallow bodies of water [51]. The
appearance of land bridges in the Eocene as well as
increasing aridity are thought to have played an important
role in terrestrial vertebrate migration, and evidence for
faunal exchange between Europe and Africa can be seen in
the fossil records of mammals and alligators [52,53]. A
notable transition in fossil assemblages of squamate reptiles also occurs around the early Eocene in Europe, with
large increases in diversity occurring at both the family
and species level [[53] and references therein]. Unfortunately, the fossil record for African squamates during that
time, particularly for small-bodied lizards, is poor [8] so
that comparable estimates of lacertid diversity are unavailable. However, both the warming trend during the late
Paleocene-early Eocene and low sea levels presumably
made intercontinental dispersal feasible for a wide range
of terrestrial vertebrates [53], possibly via land bridges or
rafting.
One possible scenario is that lacertids entered North
Africa at its northwestern edge via a chain of islands and
diversified as they moved towards the southern tip of the
continent (Figure 6; map after Popov et al. [54]). A primarily western migration for African lacertids is supported by
modern biogeography, since the basal most taxa of both
the European and African radiations are found along the
western edges of the continents. The basal-most palearctic
genus in our analysis (Podarcis; ULN, DM, CPP 50% consensus trees) occurs primarily in the western Mediterra-

nean region and Atlantolacerta andreanskyi, which
morphologically and genetically appears basal in the African radiation [7] is restricted to the Atlas Mountains in
northern Africa. Taken together, these distributions indicate that southern Iberia and northwest Africa were
important areas of divergence for modern lacertids. Similar pattern of dispersal have been hypothesized for other
terrestrial fauna, where interchanges of mammals in the
Cretaceous and Paleogene occurred along a discontinuous
route between southwestern Europe and Africa [55]. Not
until the mid-Miocene did a second, more stable land
route between southeastern Europe and Asia form, permitting effective movement between the two landmasses
[55].
Mayer and Benyr [56] and Arnold et al. [7] proposed the
colonization of Africa by Lacertidae in the Miocene over
the land bridge connecting Arabia and Africa, which
remained up until the early Pliocene [57]. Although our
dates for the initial radiation of African lacertids conflict
with this hypothesis, this geological event could still have
played an important role in the dispersal of certain members of the Saharo-Eurasian clade. Within that group, only
Adolfus and Holaspis (the latter of which is absent in our
analysis) are truly African in distribution, while the
remaining genera are palearctic. Distributions of Acanthodactylus, Mesalina, and Ophisops in Africa are mainly
restricted to the northern Atlantic coast, and the majority
of their species, along with Eremias, are found in the Middle East and Asia. This pattern suggests that the SaharoEurasian lineage may have originated in Eurasia and only
partially left the Palearctic, as opposed to secondarily recolonizing the Middle East and Asia from Africa. In fact, the
land bridge could have been crossed in the other direction, with the ancestors of modern Acanthodactylus,
Mesalina, and Ophisops entering Africa from Arabia once
the continents established secondary contact.
An alternative colonization scenario is that the African lineage split from the Lacertini in Europe prior to migrating
to Africa, and then only later radiated into its component
lineages after reaching the African continent. Discovery of
a fossil lacertid in Europe with African-like qualities
would support this hypothesis. Interestingly, the Baltic
amber lizard Succinilacerta [58] from mid-Eocene Poland
was for some time assigned to the south African genus
Nucras [59-61], suggesting that it resembles an African lacertid, at least superficially. Unfortunately, most of the
diagnostic features separating the European and African
clades, including features of the clavicle, tail, ulnar nerve
and hemipenis, are not externally visible in preserved
specimens [7]. Detailed investigation of this fossil, for
example using X-ray Computed Tomography, could
reveal internal structures assigning it to one of the modern
clades. Other alternatives to fossil evidence may be found

in additional taxon sampling for molecular studies. For
example, inclusion of the basal African species Atlantolacerta andreanskyi in future molecular clock analyses could
place a clearer temporal framework around the early evolutionary history of Eremiadini.
Reliability of fossil calibrations
To test the reliability of the oldest squamate calibrations,
the Teiidae-Amphisbaenia and the Amphisbaenia-Lacertidae splits, we alternately excluded each of them and compared their respective outcomes. Our results indicate that
when all calibrations are combined, the teiid calibration
does not have a significant effect on the estimated divergences for lacertids, since its exclusion only marginally
alters the ages of the other splits (Figure 5). At the same
time, when the teiid calibration is removed, its own divergence from lacertids/amphisbaenians becomes 17.4%
older than the oldest-known teiid fossil, whereas removal
of the amphisbaenian calibration causes the same split to
be 64% older than the prior. Although this result may support the use of fewer calibrations, it should be noted that
the use of only two fossil constraints led to unrealistic estimates, pushing the origin of Squamata well into the Permian.

With respect to future studies, we suggest that it may be
preferable to constrain calibration points individually
depending on the quality of the fossils themselves. For
some clades, the quality of different fossils in terms of
stratigraphic age or reliable phylogenetic position may be
highly variable, with some being easier to constrain confidently based on prior knowledge than others. In such
cases, the application of qualitative phylogenetic and
stratigraphic criteria as suggested by Reisz & Müller [5,62]
and Müller & Reisz [63] may be combined with exponential probability distributions, such that in case of a "good"
fossil calibration, the soft bound spans the estimated temporal range in which the split must have occurred. Conversely, in cases of more questionable fossil dates, a 10%
or 20% (or any other) upper bound may be applied.

Conclusion
Estimation of evolutionary ages for crown clades such as
the lizard family Lacertidae may be hampered by multiple
sources of uncertainty, including unknown phylogenetic
relationships, lack of an adequate fossil record, and variable evolutionary rates. These are not uncommon obstacles
in molecular dating, however they must still be addressed
within a statistical framework. Our results highlight the
advantages of a Bayesian approach. The methods we
describe allow incorporation of prior information in the
form of multiple fossil calibrations, while allowing for
statistical flexibility and the evaluation of alternative clock
models using Bayes factors. We also support the use of a
total evidence approach, in which all available molecular

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/151

data is combined. Particularly when implemented with
multiple calibrations in a Bayesian framework, the simultaneous analysis of multiple loci provides independent
constraints on the evolutionary model, thereby avoiding
potential biases associated with a single gene or genome
[64]. Finally, we stress the importance of communication
between paleontologists and molecular biologists in
establishing suitable calibrations for more than just the
major clades of Metazoa or Tetrapoda. Access to accurate
information on divergence dates and paleontological
material will allow biologists with diverse study systems
to investigate topics such as evolutionary diversification,
rates and patterns of morphological change, and historical
biogeography at finer phylogenetic scales. In this regard,
identifying groups needing additional study and developing plans to enable that study should be a top priority for
paleontologists to position themselves as important contributors to the field of molecular dating.
