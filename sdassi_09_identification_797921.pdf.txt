Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that have been found to play
important roles in silencing target genes and that are involved in the regulation of various normal
cellular processes. Until now their implication in the mammary gland biology was suggested by few
studies mainly focusing on pathological situations allowing the characterization of miRNAs as
markers of breast cancer tumour classes. If in the normal mammary gland, the expression of known
miRNAs has been studied in human and mice but the full repertoire of miRNAs expressed in this
tissue is not yet available.
Results: To extend the repertoire of mouse mammary gland expressed miRNAs, we have
constructed several libraries of small miRNAs allowing the cloning of 455 sequences. After
bioinformatics' analysis, 3 known miRNA (present in miRbase) and 33 new miRNAs were identified.
Expression of 24 out of the 33 has been confirmed by RT-PCR. Expression of none of them was
found to be mammary specific, despite a tissue-restricted distribution of some of them. No
correlation could be established between their expression pattern and evolutionary conservation.
Six of them appear to be mouse specific. In several cases, multiple potential precursors of miRNA
were present in the genome and we have developed a strategy to determine which of them was
able to mature the miRNA.
Conclusion: The cloning approach has allowed improving the repertoire of miRNAs in the
mammary gland, an evolutionary recent organ. This tissue is a good candidate to find tissue-specific
miRNAs and to detect miRNA specific to mammals. We provide evidence for 24 new miRNA. If
none of them is mammary gland specific, a few of them are not ubiquitously expressed. For the first
time 6 mouse specific miRNA have been identified.

Background
Numerous small non-coding RNAs of 18–25 bases in
length, called microRNAs (miRNAs), have been found to

play important roles in silencing specific target genes.
Recently Vasudevan et al. [1] have shown that miRNAs can
also activate gene expression, inducing translation up-reg-

ulation of target messager RNAs (mRNAs) on cell cycle
arrest. The total estimated number of reasonably conserved miRNAs in vertebrates varies from 250 [2] to 600
[3]. In human, Bentwich et al. [4] suggested that the total
number of miRNAs is above 800. The sequences of many
miRNAs are conserved among distantly related organisms
[5], but recent evidences demonstrated the presence of
primate-specific miRNAs [6,7]. miRNAs are transcripts
which are cleaved from a ~70 nucleotides hairpin precursor by Dicer [8,9]. They regulate gene expression at the
posttranscriptional level through binding to their target
mRNAs by base-pairing and subsequently inducing either
translational repression or mRNA destabilization [10].
miRNAs are involved in the regulation of various cellular
processes, including cell differentiation, cell proliferation,
development and apoptosis [11].
Several methods are used to characterize the miRNA
expression profiles in specific tissues such as Northern
blotting, RNase protection assay, RT-PCR and microarray
analyses. All these approaches depend on the prior knowledge of the miRNA sequences. If the accurate profiling of
known miRNA expression represents an important tool to
investigate physiological and pathological states, the discovery of new miRNAs is still important. Bioinformatics'
strategies and miRNA gene prediction algorithms have
been used to screen genome sequences and to identify
potential miRNAs [[2], for review [12]]. Schematically,
the bioinformatic' approaches scan genomic sequences
for the phylogenetic conservation of short nucleotides
motifs located within genomic stretches that have the
structural characteristics, ie secondary structures, of
miRNA precursors. However such gene predictions may
not reveal all miRNAs, and might especially miss those
that are not phylogenetically conserved. Furthermore, all
these in silico predictions require independent experimental validations. In contrast, the cloning approaches
allowed the identification of miRNAs without prior
knowledge of their sequences [for example [13]], but limit
the identification only to those miRNAs present at specific
moments in the studied organ.

in human breast cancers [17-21]. Recently the role of specific miRNAs (miR-206, -221 and -222) in the regulation
of the human Estrogen Receptor- in breast cancer cell
lines has been demonstrated [22,23]. Moreover some
miRNAs expression profiles have been used to identify
human breast cancer tumor subclasses [24,25]. In the normal mammary gland the expression of known miRNAs
has been studied in human [26] and mouse [27,28] at different developmental stages and found to be regulated.
Moreover the identification and characterization of miRNAs from the bovine mammary tissue by Gu et al. [29]
allowed the cloning of 33 distinct miRNAs, including 3
novel ones. Recently, Ibarra et al. [30] showed that several
miRNAs are involved in the maintenance of mouse mammary epithelial progenitor cells. The full repertoire of
miRNAs expressed in one tissue, in a specific condition or
in specific cell types is not yet available and could revealed
specific miRNAs. The mammary gland which is an evolutionary recent organ is a good candidate to search for such
tissue-specific miRNAs.

Results and discussion

The mammary gland is a dynamic organ whose structure
changes throughout the female reproductive cycle. These
successive physiological stages, that are regulated by hormones, growth factor ligands, their receptors and some
transcriptional factors, are characterized by proliferation,
differentiation and apoptosis of the mammary epithelial
tissue which is embedded in the stroma [for review:
[14,15]].

Cloning of new miRNAs from mouse mammary gland
Using the small RNA cloning method described by LagosQuintana et al. [31], cDNA libraries were constructed
from RNA samples of mouse mammary glands collected
at different stages (virgin 8 weeks, gestation 2-, 6- and 18days, lactation 4-days and involution 1-day). A total of
455 clones were obtained and sequenced, of which 169,
corresponding to 120 non redundant sequences, had
inserts ranging between 18 and 28 nt in length (Additional file 1). Most of the remaining clones contained
inserts smaller than 17 nt and were not further analysed.
The 120 non redundant sequences were compared with
known miRNAs by searching the miRBase database
(release 12.0). Nine sequences matched with mature miRNAs, 3 of them perfectly with mouse let-7b (MG030), let7c (MG070) and human miR-923 (MG041) respectively,
3 with a 1-nt difference with mouse miR-126-5p
(MG034), miR-429 (MG018) and human miR-1268
(MG068), and 3 have partial homologies (Additional file
1). Human miR-923 is 100% homologous with the
mouse genomic sequence. The above-mentioned 3
sequences that perfectly matched with known miRNAs
were thus considered as corresponding to true miRNAs
and not further analysed. Thirty-three sequences have partial homologies with 1 or several precursors of different
species, among them 17 have partial homology with the
miRNA strand, 8 with the miRNA* strand and 8 with the
loop (Additional file 1).

An implication of miRNAs in mammary gland biology
was suggested by few studies mainly focusing on pathological situations, such as the appearance of breast cancer
[[16] for review]. Some miRNAs were found deregulated

One important criteria that distinguishes miRNA from
other endogenous small RNA is the ability of their
genomic flanking sequences to adopt a hairpin structure
with the mature miRNA properly positioned within one

of its strand in order to be excised during Dicer processing
[32]. The 117 sequences cloned were aligned with the
mouse genome using BLAST, 31 of them were not found
to be homologous. They were discarded; and considered
as being cloning artefacts. For some of them we cannot
exclude that the mismatches observed are due to RNA
editing [33]. Among the 86 homologous sequences, 15
showed homology with a single location, whereas the
others could be located in several genomic regions, leading overall to a total of 441 localisations. To assess which
of the 441 regions correspond to potential miRNA genes,
their secondary structures were studied using the RNA
folding program MFOLD [34]. One hundred and fourteen
chromosomal regions, which correspond to 40 cloned
sequences, could form a stable hairpin structure. Among
the 114 chromosomal regions, 57 were annotated as
ribosomal RNA or small nuclear RNA and were discarded.
The 57 remaining corresponded to 33 cloned sequences.
Their chromosomal locations and sequence alignments
revealed that several cloned sequences were partially overlapping and could derive from the same precursor. In our
study 5 families, corresponding to 13 sequences, were
detected (Figure 1). Recently, the presence of variants has
been reported after the characterization of cDNA libraries
of small RNAs from porcine fibroblast cells [35] and from
bovine adipose tissue and mammary gland [29]. The 3'-

end variants may thus arise from preferential degradation
at the 3' end or from imprecise processing of miRNA precursors by Dicer, thereby generating miRNAs with differing 3' ends [36,37]. However, we cannot exclude the
possibility that these miRNA variants originate from multiple genomic loci. The functional specialization of
miRNA variants is still unknown. The 33 cloned
sequences could derive from 41 precursors (Additional
file 2). In fact one cloned sequence could derive from several precursors (Additional file 2, for example MG141
could be issue from 3 precursors). In some cases one
cloned sequence possess i) 2 identical precursors localised
in 2 different chromosomes (Additional file 2, MG016-13
and -16), ii) 3 identical precursors clustered in one chromosome (MG055) or iii) 2 similar precursors (with 1 or 3
different nt) in two different chromosomes (Additional
file 2, MG009/MG037/MG056/MG066-06 and -17,
MG016-04 and -1 or MG141-12 and -15, for example).
Overall the precursors are distributed on all the chromosomes but chromosomes 5, 10 and Y (Figure 2). Chromosome 1 appears to contain more mammary gland miRNA
genes than any other chromosome. Our result are in
agreement with published results [38,39] that showed
that miRNA genes are distributed among all the chromosomes but chromosome Y. Twenty-six of the precursors
are localised in intergenic regions, 14 in genes (intron: 11,
5'UTR: 1, 3'UTR: 1 and exon: 1) and 1 corresponds to one

(ENSMUSG00000076325) (Additional file 2). Thus the
majority of miRNA genes are part of intergenic sequences
(62%) as observed by Ro et al. [40]. By analysing the proximity of the 57 chromosomal locations in the mouse
genome, 4 miRNA clusters were observed (Table 1). The
miRNA genes are in the same cluster if they are less than
1000 bp apart on the same chromosome [29]. This physical proximity is consistent with recent reports of miRNA
clustering within the human genome [41]. Among the 4
clusters, 2 correspond to the association of two new precursors, MG016-01 and MG016-16, with 2 miRNAs
already described mmu-miR-689-1 and mmu-miR-689-2,
respectively (Table 1). The cluster MG055 on chromosome 1 has three repeats of the same precursor.
The evolutionary conservation of the 33 new miRNAs (25
distinct miRNAs + 8 variants; Table 2) was studied by
comparison of their sequences with the human, rat, dog,
monkey, chicken, Danio rerio, monodelphis and Ornithorhynchus anatinus genome sequences. Only 3 were
conserved in all the species studied. Six were not detected
in any other species (Table 2). If the phylogenetic conservation of the miRNA sequence is one of the criteria established by Ambros et al. [32] to characterize miRNA, it is
important to recall that for some species the sequencing of
their genome is not complete enough to detect all the
sequences cloned here. It remains that the bioinformatics'
analysis performed in this study has allowed identifying
mouse specific miRNA.

Expression profiling of the 33 new miRNAs
miRNA expression is generally examined to better understand their physiological function. In this study, the tissue
expression profile was used to assess the mammary gland
specificity of the new miRNAs. In addition these analyses
provide additional evidence for the identification of a
bona fide miRNA. Expression of the 33 new miRNAs
cloned in this study was analysed using an adapted RTPCR described by Shi and Chiang [42] and Ro et al. [43]
and detailed in the Methods' section. Using this approach,
we could detect expression for 22 of them in at least one
of the 4 analysed tissues (lactating or involuting mouse
mammary gland, brain, muscle and liver, Figure 3 and
Table 3). Based upon the multi-tissues expression profiles,
these new miRNAs have been grouped into 4 categories:
undetected (11 miRNAs), ubiquitously expressed (10
miRNAs), mammary specific (4 miRNAs), and expression
in several but not all tissues (8 miRNAs). Among the latter
category, one is not expressed in the mammary gland
stages used for the RT-PCR experiment (lactation and
involution).

The expression profile is the same for the 3 miRNAs
present in the cluster MG113/MG130; MG141. The characterization of the undetected miRNAs was completed by
studying their expression in some supplementary mammary gland stages (virgin 8 weeks, gestation day-18 or lactation day-4). Among the 11 miRNAs, only 2 have been
detected (MG004 and MG123, data not shown). Among
the 9 miRNAs undetected 3 correspond to variants of different families. We cannot exclude that these 3 variants are

cloning artefact or that this lack of detection is due to individual variation for such miRNA families. In a same family all the variants are not expressed in the same tissues. A
first analysis has allowed the identification of 4 mammary
gland specific new miRNAs, to confirm this preliminary
result their expression has been studied by RT-PCR on
more tissues (heart, intestine, ovary, lung, spleen and kidney). Finally they were found not to be mammary gland
specific: MG013 is expressed in all the tissues except kidney and heart; and MG056 is expressed in all the tissues
except in ovary and kidney; MG119 have been detected in

all tissues. MG009 was only found to be expressed in
spleen and mammary gland.
In 11 cases the miRNA is detected in mammary gland in
involution but not in lactation, a result in agreement with
the expression profile of known miRNAs at different
stages of the mammary gland biology obtained in our
team (unpublished results). However, no correlation has
been observed between the tissue-distribution of the
miRNA expression (Table 3) and their evolutionary conservation (Table 2), or between their mammary expression profile (Table 3) and their conservation in mammals

(Table 2). And the 6 miRNAs present only in the mouse
genome are expressed in the 4 tissues tested. If in this
study no mammary gland specific miRNA have been identified, several new miRNAs which are not ubiquitously
expressed have been cloned.
Functional validation of precursors detected by
bioinformatics' analysis
The bioinformatics' analysis allowed the detection of
potential precursors, but these results could not determine if these hairpin structures will be matured by RNase
III, Drosha in the nucleus and Dicer in the cytoplasm. The
use of expression vectors in cell culture, allowing the synthesis of hairpin structures that are matured into miRNAs,
has already been demonstrated [44,45]. To test the func-

tional validity of the precursors obtained by bioinformatics' analysis, we expressed them in transfected cells and
checked for the presence of the mature miRNAs. The constructs carrying the precursors (MG008-X and MG053-01)
were transiently transfected in COS-7 cells and the expression of the mature miRNAs (MG008 and MG053) was
studied by Northern blot analysis (Figure 4). As a control
the precursor of a known miRNA (let-7b) was used (data
not shown). This approach could be used to validate precursor(s) of miRNA.

Conclusion
In spite of the development of new tools, as the miRNA
arrays, the cloning approaches remain the only strategy to
identify miRNAs in a tissue at a specific stage. As the mam-

chimpanzee brain that evolution of miRNAs is an ongoing process and that along with ancient, highly conserved
miRNAs, there are a number of emerging miRNAs. Farh et
al. [46] have suggested that the binding sites of miRNAs to
3'UTR do not necessarily have to be conserved among the
different species. Therefore the miRNAs identified here
that are conserved in non mammalian species could have
also a specific role in the mammary gland, as the others.
Expression in the different stages of the mammary gland
biology and target identification of these new miRNAs
will be critical for determining their functions.
This study has allowed the identification of 6 mouse specific miRNAs, reinforcing the yet unique ability of the
cloning approach to identify such evolutionary not conserved miRNAs.

Methods
Collection of samples
The tissues were isolated from FVB/N mice. The mammary
glands were collected at different stages: virgin 8 weeks,
gestation 2-, 6- and 18-days, lactation 3- and 4-days and
involution 1- and 3-day. For all pregnancy samples, day 0
of pregnancy is the day we observed the vaginal plug. Day
1 of involution was designated as 24 h after the removal
of the pups. All mouse manipulations were done follow-

mary gland is an evolutionary recent organ, it is a good
candidate to search for new tissue-specific miRNAs. Our
study provides evidence for the occurrence in this tissue of
3 already known miRNAs and of 33 new mouse miRNAs.
Among the 33 new miRNAs, the expression of 24 of them
was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis.
If none of them is mammary gland specific, some are not
ubiquitous and are good candidates to further analyse
their roles in the mammary gland biology.
One of the rules proposed by Ambros et al. [32] to characterize a miRNAs is the phylogenic conservation of the
miRNA sequences. In our study, no correlation could be
established between the expression and the evolutionary
conservation of these new miRNAs. Our result is in agreement with the data obtained by Berezikov et al. [7] showing by comparing the miRNA content of human and

Small RNA isolation and cloning
For the library construction, small RNAs were isolated
using mirVanaTMP miRNA isolation kit (Ambion) according the manufacturer's instructions. Small RNA cloning
was performed as described by Lagos-Quintana et al. [31]
without the step of concatemerization of the PCR products. Briefly, 500 g of RNA were size fractionated using
15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE). Excised gel bands were homogenized in NaCl 0.3
M overnight at 4°C to solubilize RNA. 3' adapter (5' phosphorylated) was ligated to the RNA fraction in presence of
T4 RNA ligase (Amersham-Pharmacia). The mix was size
fractionated using 15% PAGE and a 5' adapter was ligated.
The sample was again size fractionated using 15% PAGE
before to be reverse transcribed using primer complementary to the 3' adapter sequence and PCR amplified using
primers on both adapters. Amplified products were
cloned using pGEM-T vector system I (Promega). Clones
with inserts were sequenced.
Bioinformatics' analysis
Small RNA sequences ranging between 18 and 25-nt in
length obtained from the libraries were multi-aligned by
CLUSTAL W software [47] to exclude redundant
sequences [48]. The distinct sequences were used to search
in miRBase [49] with BLASTN to identify conserved
miRNA [50]. The sequences were mapped in the mouse
genome from EnsEMBL mouse genome database [51]. A
fragment of ~260 nucleotides genomic sequence flanking
the small RNA at both 5' and 3' ends was used for predicting the secondary structure of the miRNA precursor (stemloop formations) using the MFOLD program (version
3.2) [34,52]. If a sequence including a small RNA formed
a stem-loop, if the small RNA size ranged from 18–25 nt
and had not been registered in the miRBase, we classified
it as a new miRNA. The sequences of the new miRNA candidates and their precursors were subjected to a BLASTN
search against NCBI genomes to estimate the species conservation.
miRNA expression analysis
Total RNAs were isolated from tissue samples and from
COS cells using the RNA NOW kit (Biogentex inc.)
according to the manufacturer's protocol with a small
modification. The RNAs were precipitated at -20°C overnight by the addition of 3 volumes of ethanol. An equalmolar mix of total RNA from 3 different mice was used for
reverse transcription.

Detection of miRNAs by RT-PCR has been realized after
addition of linkers to the retro-transcribed RNA before
amplification [42,43]. Briefly, 5 g of total RNA were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/149

polyadenylated according to Ambion's protocol (polyA
Polymerase, Ambion, Applied Biosystems, France). The
polyadenylated RNAs were reverse transcribed with a
polyT adapter composed of a polyT sequence and a universal
oligonucleotide
(5'CGAATTCTAGAGCTCGAGGCAGGCGACATGGCTGG
CTAGTTAAGCTTGGTACCGAGCTCGGATCDetection
was
CACTAGTCC(T)25(ACG)(ACGT)3').
achieved by PCR using a set of primers composed of the
universal primer corresponding to the 5' end of the polyTadapter (5'CGAATTCTAGAGCTCGAGGCAGG3') and a
primer specific of the miRNA sequence (Additional file 3).
Reaction products were separated on 2% agarose gel. The
detection of miRNA let-7c has been used as positive control and was indeed detected in all analysed samples (data
not shown).
For Northern blot analysis, 20 g of total RNA were fractionated using a 15% PAGE, transferred to Hybond-N+
membrane (Amersham) by capillarity. Blots were hybridized overnight at 55°C with radioactively [-32P]ATP
labeled DNA oligonucleotide probe complementary to
miRNA sequences in Phosphate buffer [53], washed twice
with 2×SSC at 55°C, and exposed to Phosphor Screen and
the StormScan software.
Vector design
The precursor vectors contain the sequences design from
MG008 and MG053 precursors (sequence in bold in
Additional file 2). For MG053 precursor, the oligonucleotides
sense
(5'CGGGATCCCGAGCGCCGAATCCCCGCCGCGCGTC
GCGGCGTG3')
and
antisense
(5'CGGGATCCCGGGTCTTCCGTACGCCACATTTCCCAC
GCCGCGACGCGCGGCGG3') were annealed, filled with
the Klenow fragment enzyme and digested by BamHI. The
resulting fragment was inserted into the BamHI site of the
pUHD10.3 plasmid [54]. The MG008 precursor fragment
was obtained by PCR on mouse genomic DNA using the
primer
sense
(5'CGGGATCCCGGTTTCAAAGTTTTGATAGGTTCTACGC
and
antisense
ATG3')
(5'CGGGATCCCGGCTTCAGCTTTGACTTTCAGAGCACT
GGG3') and digested by BamHI before to be cloned into
the BamHI site of the pUHD10.3 plasmid. The orientation
of the insert was characterized by PCR using the primer
sense of the precursor and the primer of the plasmid
design in each side of the cloning site (primer rtTA/1:
5'GATGCCCTGGAATTGACGAG3' and primer glob/2:
5'TATAACATGAATTTTTCAATAGCG3'). In these vectors,
the precursor is placed under the transcriptional regulation of the CMV promoter, already validated in COS-7 cell
culture (personal communication).

Cell culture experiments
COS-7 cell were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's
medium (DMEM) with addition of 10% fetal calf serum,
2 mM glutamine, penicillin 10 U/l and streptomycin
100 U/l at 37°C (5% of CO2). The expression vectors
were transfected using the jetPEI™ cationic reagent (PolyPlus transfection) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection.
