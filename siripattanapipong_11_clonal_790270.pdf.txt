Abstract
Background: The glutamate dehydrogenase gene (gdh) is one of the most popular and useful genetic markers for
the genotypic analysis of Giardia duodenalis (syn. G. lamblia, G. intestinalis), the protozoan that widely causes enteric
disease in humans. To determine the distribution of genotypes of G. duodenalis in Thai populations and to
investigate the extent of sequence variation at this locus, 42 fecal samples were collected from 3 regions of
Thailand i.e., Central, Northern, and Eastern regions. All specimens were analyzed using PCR-based genotyping and
recombinant subcloning methods.
Results: The results showed that the prevalence of assemblages A and B among these populations was
approximately equal, 20 (47.6%) and 22 (52.4%), respectively. Sequence analysis revealed that the nucleotide
diversity of assemblage B was significantly greater than that in assemblage A. Among all assemblage B positive
specimens, the allelic sequence divergence within isolates was detected. Nine isolates showed mixed alleles,
ranged from three to nine distinct alleles per isolate. Statistical analysis demonstrated the occurrence of genetic
recombination within subassemblages BIII and BIV was likely.
Conclusion: This study supports increasing evidence that G. duodenalis has the potential for genetic exchange.
Keywords: Giardia duodenalis, glutamate dehydrogenase, genetic diversity, genetic exchange

Background
Giardia duodenalis (also known as G. lamblia and G.
intestinalis) is a widely distributed diplomonad protozoon that causes enteric disease in humans and other
vertebrates. This parasite has increasingly gained attention as a common cause of diarrheal disease in humans
in both developed and developing countries. The average incidence of G. duodenalis is globally estimated at
2.8 × 108 cases each year [1]. In developing countries in
Asia, Africa, and Latin America, approximately 200 million people are infected with this organism [2] with an
average of 500,000 new cases per year [3]. Molecular

studies have revealed that G. duodenalis is a morphologically uniform species complex [4-9]. Based on genetic
data from the glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) gene, a
substantial level of genetic diversity in this species has
been resolved into eight distinct lineages, assigned as
assemblages A to H [2,10]. G. duodenalis recovered
from humans falls only into assemblages A and B,
which can be further classified into subgroups AI, AII,
BIII, and BIV while the other assemblages (C to H) are
animal-specific [2,10]. However, assemblages A and B
have also been isolated from other animals, including
livestock, cats, dogs, and rats.
Giardia, like other diplomonads, possesses two diploid
nuclei (2 × 2N) in the trophozoite stage. Both nuclei,
contain the same genetic information [11], are transcriptionally active [11,12] and replicate at approximately the

same time [13]. On the other hand, in the cyst stage, the
ploidy has changed to 16N (4 × 4N), which is the result
of two rounds of nuclear division without cytokinesis
[14,15]. Molecular data have revealed that certain
nucleotides are different between the nuclei, with heterogeneity demonstrated between homologous chromosomes and allelic sequence heterozygosity (ASH). The
level of ASH varies in different assemblages as assemblage B has been revealed to exhibit a higher level of
overall ASH (0.5%) than that seen in assemblage A (<
0.01%) [16,17]. However, this low level of ASH is unusual for an asexually reproducing organism with a polyploid genome, like Giardia, indicating that some sort of
genetic exchange may occur in and between trophozoites. One mechanism that can properly explain this
finding is genetic recombination as a mean of maintaining a low level of ASH. Several studies have been conducted to provide more evidence of the existence of
such a mechanism. Even though most studies supported
the possibility of genetic recombination, the data were
basically obtained from laboratory strains as well as
small numbers of field isolates [18,19]. The aims of this
study were to characterize nucleotide heterozygosity and
provide more evidence of recombination within field
isolates collected from different regions of Thailand
using the gdh locus.

Methods
1. Parasite isolates

A total of 42 fecal specimens of G. duodenalis were
obtained from 3 regions of Thailand, as part of a public
health survey. Each sample was coded with 2 or 3 letter
codes to define the populations, 10 isolates with HT
code were from the hill tribes, Northern Thailand, 19
isolates with Pre and TSH codes were from pre-school
children and villagers in the Eastern part, and the 13
isolates with Or code were from orphans at a baby’s
home, Central Thailand.
G. duodenalis cysts were concentrated using a sodium
nitrate flotation technique [20]. In brief, approximately 2
g of stools were suspended in 4 ml of 60% NaNO3, filtered through gauze and left for 20 minutes. One ml of
the supernatant was collected from each sample then
washed three times with phosphate buffered saline
(PBS); the cysts in the sediment from the last wash were
kept at -20°C until used.
2. Ethics statement

The ethical aspects of this study have been approved by
the ethical committee of the Royal Thai Army Medical
Department, Phramongkutklao College of Medicine,
Thailand. Informed consent was written and was provided by all study participants and/or their legal
guardians.

3. DNA preparation

DNA was extracted from concentrated stool samples
using FTA Classic Card (Whatman Bioscience, USA). A
total of 15 μl of concentrated stool was applied on a 6
mm-diameter FTA disk, and then was air-dried overnight. The one-fourth piece of FTA disk was washed
twice with 200 μl of FTA purification reagent (Whatman Bioscience, USA) for 5 min and then washed twice
with 200 μl of TE-1 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM
EDTA [pH 8.0]) for 5 min and air-dried overnight. The
washed paper was used directly as the DNA template in
the PCR reactions. In addition, a QIAmp Stool Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Germany) was used for DNA extraction for
specimens that gave negative results with the FTA
method.
4. DNA amplification

A nested PCR was performed to amplify a 456 bp fragment of the gdh gene by using primers and conditions
previously described [21]. The primary PCR was carried
out in a total volume of 25 μl reaction mixture containing 2 pieces of FTA disk or 1-2 μl of the extracted DNA
as DNA template, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 250 mM of each
deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 1 U of GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega, USA) with 1× GoTaq PCR buffer,
and 12.5 pmol of each primer, GDH1, GDH1a and
GDH5s. Primary thermocycler conditions were as follows: (i) 7 min at 94°C; (ii) 35 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1
min at 55°C, and 1 min at 72°C; and (iii) 7 min at 72°C.
The secondary PCR was carried out in a total volume of
25 μl reaction mixture that contained 2 to 5 μl of undiluted primary PCR product with the same concentrations as those of the primary PCR, except for 1.5 mM
MgCl2, and GDHeF and GDHiR primers. The secondary
thermocycler conditions were as follows: (i) 2 min at 94°
C; (ii) 1 min at 56°C; (iii) 2 min at 72°C; (iv) 55 cycles
of 30 sec at 94°C, 20 sec at 56°C, and 45 sec at 72°C;
and (v) 7 min at 72°C. The amplified products were
electrophoresed on a 1.25% agarose gel (Invitrogen,
USA). DNA extracts of G. duodenalis from an axenic
culture was used as positive control throughout the
study.
5. DNA cloning and sequencing

The PCR products were purified using a Wizard® SV
Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega, Madison,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction and
directly sequenced. Both strands of the entire fragments
were sequenced with primers GDHeF and GDHiR, then
manually assembled in BioEdit version 7.0.1. When the
one singleton substitution was found, the sequencing
was repeated with the PCR product from the independent PCR amplification. If a superimposed signal in
chromatograms was detected, showing incorporation of

Siripattanapipong et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:206
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/206

the two bases resulting from co-amplification, cloning of
this PCR product was performed to confirm the existence of the multiple templates. To clone, the purified
PCR product was ligated into pGEM-T Easy vector
(Promega, Madison, USA). Ligated product was introduced into JM109 competent cells by transformation.
The recombinant plasmids were purified from 10 positive clones of each sample using the HiYield Plasmid
mini kit (RBC Bioscience, Taiwan) and sequenced using
universal primer SP6. DNA sequencing was conducted
by 1st Base Pte. Ltd., Singapore. The novel nucleotide
substitutions obtained from clones corresponded to
alleles if the substitution at that position occurred two
or more times.
6. Sequence analysis

On all analyses, the priming sites were trimmed from
both ends of all sequences which reduced the fragment
size to 414 bp. All sequences were multiple aligned with
the default option using CLUSTAL X, version 2.0.12
[22] and analyzed separately based on their assemblages,
assemblage A and assemblage B. Each assemblage was
both analyzed separately depending on the origins of the
isolate and together. The partial sequences of the gdh
gene of the G. duodenalis ATCC 50803 assemblage A
isolate WB and G. duodenalis ATCC 50581 assemblage
B isolate GS, acquired from GiardiaDB: The Giardia
Genomics Resource http://giardiadb.org/giardiadb/, were
used as reference sequences. The subassemblages were
assigned through Bayesian inference constructed using
MrBAYES Version 3.1.2 [23]. The reference sequences
of assemblage AI (accession no. L40509), AII (accession
no. L40510), BIII (accession no. AF069059), and BIV
(accession no. L40508) were also implemented in the
tree. The analysis of synonymous and non-synonymous
amino acid substitutions was performed using MEGA
version 4 [24]. The level of nucleotide divergence (K),
including synonymous (Ks) and nonsynonymous (Ka)
divergence rates, and number of allele were calculated
using DnaSP version 5 [25]. This program was also used
to quantify the level of genetic variation among Giardia
isolates collected from different regions by the Wright’s
fixation index (F ST ). This index is the correlation
between alleles randomly chosen within the same population relative to alleles within the entire population.
The effect of the amino acid substitutions was predicted
based on sequence homology and the physical properties of amino acids using Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT) program [26].
For distinguishing whether the fragments of DNA
sequences were neutrally evolved or derived under selection processes, the Tajima’s D was calculated using
DnaSP version 5 [25]. Tajima’s D statistic determines
the difference between two nucleotide variation

parameters, the average number of polymorphisms
between all pairs of sequences (π) and the total number
of polymorphic sites of all sequences in the dataset (θ).
The greater value of π implies positive selection while
the greater value of θ implies negative selection [27].
In order to test for recombination, gdh gene sequences
of G. duodenalis available from GenBank on March 2010
were additionally included in the analysis. Because the
region and the length of the gdh sequences deposited in
GenBank varied depending on the primers used by individual research studies, the 75 sequences originated from
14 countries were selected with the minimum coverage
at 75% to the fragment size used for analysis in this study
(Table 1). The phylogenetic network tree was used to
visualize the extent of networked evolution among the
sequences which preliminarily indicate possible locations
of recombination events [28]. Principally, the phylogenetic tree and phylogenetic network tree are each constructed on a different basis. The phylogenetic tree is
constructed under the assumption that once two lineages
are created, they will subsequently not interact with each
other again, whereas the phylogenetic network assumes
the evolutionary process in a more relaxed manner and
constructs the tree under the assumption that the interaction between these two lineages might have occurred
again later on. To present the data according to the aims
of this study, this method is more appropriate than a
conventional bifurcating phylogenetic tree. The analysis
was undertaken with the SplitsTree program version 4
[29], through the Neighbor-Net method [30]. This
method draws networks between sequences if there are
potentially multiple evolutionary pathways linking them.
The analysis was performed using sequences of all isolates presented in this study together with the sequences
selected from GenBank. For the isolates that carried the
heterozygous polymorphic sites identified by cloning, the
standard one-letter code for combining nucleotides
defined by the International Union of Pure and Applied
Chemistry nomenclature (IUPAC) was used.
To provide the evidence on recombination that could
occur, the alignments were examined using two tests:
the four-gamete test from the DnaSP version 5 [25] and
the F statistic test from the PhiPack program [31]. The
four-gamete test is the method based on the principle of
compatibility that has the number of recombination
events as the quantity of interest. This method functions
under the infinite-alleles model in which the mutation
rate for any site is infinitesimal and only the mutation
would lead to the different alleles. As such, when considering any two sites, there are at most four gametic
types in the population. Since the back mutation and
recurrent mutation is negligible in this model, the presence of all four gametic types will be due to the occurrence of recombination event between the two sites

[32]. In PhiPack, the F (or pairwise homoplasy index,
PHI) statistic, the method based on refined incompatibility, is used to detect the recombination. This test
relies on the assumption that the level of genealogical
correlation between neighboring sites is negatively correlated with the rate of recombination [31]. If the
recombination rate is zero, all sites have the same history and the order of the sites does not reflect the genealogical correlation. On the other hand, if the
recombination rate is finite, the order of the sites
becomes important as distant sites give a tendency to
have less genealogical correlation than adjacent sites.
The significance of the analysis is obtained using a permutation test. In this study, the parameters were set to
examine the significance of the test using 1000 PHI permutation and window size at 100.

Results
Diversity of the isolates

Determination of the 414 bp region of the gdh gene
obtained from direct sequencing revealed that, among
the 42 isolates, clear electrochromatograms without any
superimposed signals were observed in 33 (78.6%) isolates. Of the remaining nine (21.4%) isolates, multiple
signals were observed in certain positions along the
sequences. Subcloning and sequencing of these isolates
making up the whole dataset contained 54 distinct
alleles from a total 86 isolates/clones. The multiple
alleles held by each isolate ranged from three to nine
alleles; nine different alleles in isolate Pre2403, eight
alleles in isolate Or172 and Pre1402, seven alleles in isolate HT187, five alleles in isolate HT57 and HT105, four
alleles in isolate HT193 and Pre2103, and three alleles
in Or176 (Table 2 and 3).

Assemblage assignment

As shown in Figure 1, the Bayesian inferred tree based on
the distance method showed that the gdh sequences of all
86 isolates/clones were clustered into two major clades
with the respective reference sequences, assemblages A and
B. Within the assemblage A clade, using HT124 and
HT105 as representatives, 20 isolates were clustered with
the assemblage AII reference sequence while none
belonged to assemblage AI. The remaining 66 sequences/
clones from 22 isolates were placed in the assemblage B
clade which divided into two sister clades. Five sequences/
clones from two isolates were grouped in the subclade
belonging to the subassemblage BIII and the other 61
sequences/clones from 21 isolates were clustered within
subassemblage BIV subclade. These results showed that
prevalence of the isolates carrying assemblages A and B
was approximately equal, 47.6% and 52.4%, respectively,
and the prevalence of subassemblage BIV was predominant
over subassemblage BIII. Moreover, the phylogenetic analyses also showed that four of eight distinct clones obtained
from isolate Or172 were assigned to subassemblage BIII
(clones C1, C3, C7, and C8) whereas clones C2, C4, C5,
and C6 shared a closer relationship to subassemblage BIV.
Sequence variation and allelic divergence

Analysis of 20 assemblage A isolates revealed that few
variations occurred within this assemblage. Only two

different alleles were observed with four synonymous
substitutions when compared with the reference
sequence. No sequence variation was found within this
group except for the single different allele from the isolate Pre3111 that contained two different sites. The
overall intra-assemblage divergence of this assemblage
(K) was only 0.96% and the divergence at synonymous
positions (Ks) was 0.0019. In assemblage B, the 66
sequences/clones showed that they were 52 different
alleles with 4 nonsynonymous and 24 synonymous
amino acid substitutions when compared with their
reference sequence. The intra-assemblage variation of
this assemblage was 6.76% with the divergence of synonymous (Ks) and nonsynonymous positions (Ka) at 0.039
and 0.001, respectively (Table 4). Due to the nucleotide
substitutions, four nonsynonymous changes were
detected. Thus, nucleotide changes at position 274, Leucine (L) was changed to Valine (V). At position 340,
Asparagine (N) was changed to Aspartic acid (D) while
at position 391, Aspartic acid (D) was changed to Asparagine (N) and at position 436, Serine (S) was changed to
Alanine (A) (Table 5). The SIFT software was used to
predict the effect of these changes with 41 homologous
sequences fetched from the UniProt-SwissProt 56.6
database. Using SIFT, it predicts the possibility of the
effect caused by the substitution change by using the
scoring method. The score is the normalized probability
that the amino acid change is tolerated. The reliability
of this score is supported by the value, which measures
the diversity of the sequences in the alignment. Generally, the substitution site of the score less than 0.05 is
predicted as a deleterious site with the support of median conservation values between 2.75 and 3.25 considered as a reliable prediction. Our results showed that all
substitution changes were tolerated to the alteration of
the protein function with all prediction scores > 0.05
and supported by the median conservation value of 3.08
(Table 5).
Since the low genetic variation level of assemblage A
does not reach the usual value observed in sexual populations, almost identical nucleotide sequences do not
warrant further analysis. Thus, the sequence data of
assemblage A were not included in the downstream
analysis.
Estimate of geographic differentiation

Phylogenetic analysis has shown that both assemblage A
and B isolates have been dispersed throughout all studied geographical locations and appeared to be weakly
supported for geographical sub-structuring. To determine if the traits from this inference were correct, the
level of genetic distinction between each geographic
population was estimated. The Wright’s test measures
the level of genetic distinction between populations,

Figure 1 Bayesian analyses of the gdh gene were performed using the HKY85+Γ+I, selected by jModelTest version 0.1 [42], as a
model of sequence evolution. Starting trees were random, four simultaneous Markov chains were run for 1,000,000 generations, and trees
were sampled every 100 generations. Bayesian posterior probabilities were calculated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling approach
implemented in MrBAYES program. The sequence HT124 is 100% identical to HT137, HT144, Or006, Or019, Or87, Or88, Or94, Or98, Or140, Or215,
Or262, Or287, Pre1209, Pre2208, TSH292, TSH408, TSH1123, and TSH2014. The sequence HT105 is 100% identical to HT187C2, Or176C1, Pre016,
Pre1402C5, Pre2018, Pre2103C3, and TSH1250. The sequence HT123C1 is 100% identical to TSH1210. The sequence HT142 is 100% identical to

Test for neutrality and recombination

The values of Tajima’s D statistical estimation are
shown in Table 7. Across all populations and in each
population, the test gave a tendency for negative values
that is indicative of the occurrence of selection pressure.
However, these results were not statistically significant
(Table 7).
For the test of recombination, the phylogenetic network reconstructed from the gdh gene fragment
obtained in this study and GenBank partially gave a
treelike structure, except the area at the center of the
tree. The network was separated into two large
branches, according to subassemblages BIII and BIV,
with long and short branches extending from both of
them (Figure 2). The conflicting signals were explicitly
observed in both branches, which implied the alternative phylogenetic histories existed separately existed in
both subassemblages. Of 75 sequences from 14 countries, they seemingly dispersed throughout both
branches with no specific geographical significances
observed. Additionally, the four-gamete test detected
recombination events within the sequence data of this
study in both subassemblages BIII and BIV, suggesting
intra-assemblage recombination among them. In addition, the same results still persisted when the sequence
data from GenBank were additionally included in the
test. The significance of recombination identified by
the four-gamete test was further emphasized with the
additional implementation of the F test. The results
from this test were almost consistent to the former
test and showed statistical significances within all dataset, except for the data of subassemblage BIV from
this study alone (Table 8).

Discussion
This study focused on genetic diversity of G. duodenalis
at the gdh gene using isolates collected from three different regions of Thailand. Cloning and sequencing
approaches were used to elucidate heterologous alleles
existed within the samples. Many studies have often
detected overlapping nucleotide peaks which represented as mixed template at several genetic markers
from different geographical locations [33]. The result of
mixed templates gives rise to a question whether this
phenomenon is actually the result of mixed infection or
the occurrence of ASH. Until now, there is still no
direct evidence to prove which one plays a major role in
the occurrence of ambiguous nucleotides. Thus, to provide conclusive evidence, further studies are required to
explain the existence of ASH using cloned isolates of G.
duodenalis which has never been shown by any studies.
Although our study used the isolates from the patients
without being cloned, to support the existence of ASH,
indirect evidence of genetic exchange by recombination
was obtained using bioinformatics studies.
The results obtained from the present study revealed
that G. duodenalis isolates containing multiple alleles
naturally presented in every area surveyed in Thailand,
as shown by sequencing results of the subclones from
isolates having overlapping chromatogram signals. These
heterogenous sequencing results were observed only
within assemblage B and throughout subtypes BIII and
BIV whereas all assemblage A was homogeneous. The
co-amplification of the cross-contaminated isolate was
unlikely to occur because the isolates from each region
were collected and processed at different times. Additionally, every isolate that revealed mixed templates was
repeatedly tested under independent PCR and sequencing reactions. However, this finding seems to be common, as the occurrence of heterogeneous positions in
the sequences of the gdh gene of assemblage A is markedly low [34]. The presence of heterogenous nucleotides
obtained from direct sequencing is usually considered to
be the results of simultaneous infection with more than
one Giardia assemblage. However, using the subcloning
technique, the abundance of nine different gdh alleles
observed in some isolates, lead us to presume that it
could not be only the outcome of mixed infection.
Hence, the existence of the ASH in these isolates should
also be taken into consideration.
Alignment analysis of the polymorphic sites within
assemblage B revealed that almost all nucleotide substitutions observed were synonymous changes, except for
four positions. The Tajima’s D test on the gdh gene
showed contrasting results to those obtained with the bgiardin gene of other studies. The b-giardin gene was
likely to be under the effects of ongoing purifying

selection [35] while the gdh gene was under neutral
selection. This suggested that molecular adaptation of
these two genes might be influenced by different pressures. Furthermore, the computational prediction estimated that these changes did not influence the protein
function. It indicated that variations appeared in the
amino acid level are neutral or advantageous but not
deleterious. The prediction is based on the non-structure method that considers the information from the
amino acid sequence of interest, such as the position
and type of amino acid changes, and compares their
properties with the homolog protein family in the database [26]. This method seems to be the most reliable
option to predict the effect of the nonsynonymous substitution in this gene since most of the gdh gene studies
are based on partial sequences. This may be due to the

limitation of primer design to amplify the whole gene as
this gene contains a number of variations and high percentage of GC content [36].
The estimation of the fixation index between three
different sampling areas in Thailand did not support
geographical sub-structuring within the G. duodenalis
isolates. At present, the variations found in this study
could not explain the geographical distribution of
infected individuals. The only observation about the
geographical aspect shown in this study is that the G.
duodenalis populations were widely distributes throughout all three regions. The lack of geographical sub-structuring shown in this study was not unexpected since
small fragments of only one gene were used to analyze
the geographical distribution of this protozoan. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is still no
genotyping system that can efficiently indicate geographical sub-structuring of this organism, even using multilocus genes as genotypic markers [37]. Whilst, the
application of the high-resolution genotyping system is
still necessary to address this question since it will be
useful to distinguish different transmission routes and
sources of infection.
Since the first finding of the genes known to function
during meiosis and later confirmed by cloning and
sequencing of PCR products [19,38], the question about
the potential capability of sexual reproduction in

Siripattanapipong et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:206
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/206

Giardia has been proposed. Subsequently, a number of
studies have been conducted to provide evidence in support of genetic exchange among G. duodenalis isolates
[18,19,39]. The present research attempted to extend
the study of this issue to the next step by testing the
potential of recombination events with the genetic data
obtained from field isolates. In this study, we used the
recombination analysis to show that the ASH could be a
consequence of genetic exchange.
When the reticulate events, such as hybridization,
gene transfer, and genetic recombination, are suspected
to be involved, the phylogenetic network is one of the
method that play a role in the accommodation of the
non-treelike evolution. By using an agglomerative process implemented in the algorithm of Neighbor-Net, it
can represent the conflicting signal or alternative phylogenetic histories, which are not adequately modeled by
the bifurcating phylogenetic tree, in the format of a split
graph. The presentation of the reticulations in the network indicated the possibility of interaction between
two hypothetical ancestors to become extant taxa. In
this study, the network tree clearly showed that the
recombination might not be a phenomenon limited to
laboratory strains and the interactions between taxa
separately occurred within their own lineages of assemblages BIII and BIV.
Besides the evidence from the phylogenetic network
tree, more intensive analyses were applied to further
investigate the possibility of recombination from the
dataset of this study. Two tests were selected based on
their different assumptions for detecting the recombination to validate the evidence obtained from network
tree. Four-gamete test is different from other general
recombination testing methods that it is the populationspecific method, generating to detect recombination
between closely related genotypes. However, not all
recombination events are revealed by this test due to its
limitation that not support the occurrence of the recurrent or convergent mutations.
To confirm the results from the four-gamete test, a
robust statistical test for recombination, F test, was
applied. This recently developed approach is designed to
operates under more relax model and has been proved
through empirical data analysis that it can effectively
discriminate between the presence and absence of
recombination in both closely and distantly related samples [31].
The positivity of the four-gamete test and the statistical significance obtained from the F test strongly indicated the existence of the recombination in both
subassemblages BIII and BIV. However, the recombination events were not significant when analyzing only
sequence data of subassemblage BIV. This might be due
to a small number of sequence data used for analysis

Page 10 of 11

(only 5 sequences tested). Low levels of variation among
sequences limited the detection of recombination using
this test [40]. Generally, there are four major goals in
the study of recombination that are i) detecting evidence
of recombination in a dataset, ii) identifying the mosaic
sequences, iii) delineating their breakpoints, and iv)
quantifying recombination [41]. Clearly, the majority of
the Giardia studies, including this study, are in the early
stage for recombination analysis that all evidences are
indirectly detected from the mathematical and statistical
models. Usually, if significant evidence for recombination can be detected, the localization of the recombination breakpoint is the next goal for the analysis. If the
mosaic pattern of the sequence can be demonstrated,
this will support the existence of genetic recombination
in this organism.

Conclusions
We demonstrated that some field isolates of G. duodenalis
from Thailand contained heterogeneity and sequence variations, especially those of assemblage B. The alternative
evolution signals visualized by the phylogenetic network
tree with the association of the results from two powerful
recombination tests strongly supported evidence of genetic
exchange by recombination in this organism.
