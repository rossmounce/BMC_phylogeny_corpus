Mycalesina (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Satyrini)

Abstract
Background: Butterflies of the subtribe Mycalesina (Nymphalidae: Satyrinae) are important model organisms in
ecology and evolution. This group has radiated spectacularly in the Old World tropics and presents an exciting
opportunity to better understand processes of invertebrate rapid radiations. However, the generic-level taxonomy
of the subtribe has been in a constant state of flux, and relationships among genera are unknown. There are six
currently recognized genera in the group. Mycalesis, Lohora and Nirvanopsis are found in the Oriental region, the
first of which is the most speciose genus among mycalesines, and extends into the Australasian region. Hallelesis
and Bicyclus are found in mainland Africa, while Heteropsis is primarily Madagascan, with a few species in Africa. We
infer the phylogeny of the group with data from three genes (total of 3139 bp) and use these data to reconstruct
events in the biogeographic history of the group.
Results: The results indicate that the group Mycalesina radiated rapidly around the Oligocene-Miocene boundary.
Basal relationships are unresolved, but we recover six well-supported clades. Some species of Mycalesis are nested
within a primarily Madagascan clade of Heteropsis, while Nirvanopsis is nested within Lohora. The phylogeny
suggests that the group had its origin either in Asia or Africa, and diversified through dispersals between the two
regions, during the late Oligocene and early Miocene. The current dataset tentatively suggests that the
Madagascan fauna comprises two independent radiations. The Australasian radiation shares a common ancestor
derived from Asia. We discuss factors that are likely to have played a key role in the diversification of the group.
Conclusions: We propose a significantly revised classification scheme for Mycalesina. We conclude that the group
originated and radiated from an ancestor that was found either in Asia or Africa, with dispersals between the two
regions and to Australasia. Our phylogeny paves the way for further comparative studies on this group that will
help us understand the processes underlying diversification in rapid radiations of invertebrates.

Background
Knowledge of phylogenetic relationships among the species comprising a rapid radiation has proved invaluable
for detailed investigations into the processes and patterns
of their diversification. There are still relatively few studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms of radiations for invertebrates, even in popular groups such as
butterflies which feature prominent model-organisms in
evolutionary biology [1]. It is the lack of robust phylogenies for such groups that has imposed a crucial impediment for comparative analyses. Among butterflies, a

phylogenetic perspective has been applied to a number of
radiations (e.g. [2-6]). However, few butterfly groups can
compare with the mycalesine radiation (Nymphalidae:
Satyrinae: Satyrini: Mycalesina) in terms of diversity of
species and geographic sweep. They have been acclaimed
as one of the most spectacular butterfly radiations, comprising more than 270 species usually placed in six genera [7,8]. Mycalesines are found across the Old World
tropics in both forested and open habitats and are characterized by high levels of endemicity throughout their
range. Unlike other butterfly radiations, which typically
peak in diversity within a single zoogeographic region
(e.g. Arhopala in SE Asia), all major palaeotropical
regions - Madagascar, Africa, the Indian subcontinent,

Indo-China, the larger islands of South-East Asia (notably
Sulawesi), New Guinea and the Solomon Islands are each
represented by a species-rich mycalesine fauna. The
Indo-Australian, Afrotropical and Madagascan regions
have roughly equal numbers of species [7]. This group of
butterflies thus presents an exciting opportunity to
understand their diversification within a phylogenetic
framework.
The level of diversity in fundamental body plan and in
larval and adult feeding biology is relatively modest
compared to other butterfly groups with similar species
richness. This relative morphological and behavioural
conservatism contrasts sharply with a spectacular array
of scent organs found in males and some striking differences in expression of wing ocelli and colour patterns
[7,9]. The existing generic classification scheme has
been based mostly on limited morphological characters
such as the presence of hairy eyes (interommatidial
setae), forewing venation [9-11] or scent organs [12],
which have been considered inadequate character sets
for resolving their systematics [13-15]. The circumscriptions of genera have been in a constant state of flux,
with early revisions for instance [12] and [16] for Asian
and African species respectively, and several more
recent local revisions based on morphology.
Despite work on regional mycalesine faunas, there has
been no coherent attempt to date to classify the entire
group. The need for robust phylogenetic hypotheses
from molecular data to resolve this issue has been
stressed [8,17]. A study on the mycalesines of Madagascar (also including a few African species; [8]) using
molecular data from two mitochondrial genes (Cytochrome oxidase II and Cytochrome b) reported that the
majority of Madagascan genera were not monophyletic,
corroborating results from a previous morphological
study [7]. Accordingly, the pre-existing genera Henotesia, Admiratio and Masoura were subsumed under Heteropsis as sub-genera, while Houlbertia was sunk
completely [8,18]. The Afrotropical region now consists
of three genera Heteropsis, Hallelesis and Bicyclus [9,19].
The genus Heteropsis Westwood (1850) comprises
around 81 known species of which 46 are described and
a further ca. 24 undescribed species are known in the
Malagasy Region [7,18,20]. About 12 Heteropsis species
are distributed in continental Africa [21-24] whilst Hallelesis, with two species, is confined to West and Central
Africa [25]. Bicyclus consists of ca. 80 species in mainland Africa [9] with one species, B. anynana, also found
in the Comoros [26]. Species-level relationships within
the genus were investigated in a molecular study [27],
for which data from three other mycalesine genera were
used to root the tree. Although Bicyclus was eventually
recovered as a clade, their sampling of other genera was
too poor to establish firm support for its monophyly.

The remaining three genera (Mycalesis Hübner, 1818,
Lohora Moore, 1880 and Nirvanopsis Vane-Wright,
2003) are found in the Indo-Australian tropics. Mycalesis is the most species-rich among current mycalesine
genera with estimates of the number of species ranging
from 87 to over 100 [28-31]. This genus is almost ubiquitously distributed in the Indo-Australian region ranging from Sri Lanka and India in the West, across IndoChina, South-East Asia and New Guinea, to North-East
Australia and the Solomon Islands in the East. Lohora
and Nirvanopsis are endemic to Sulawesi. Lohora contains 17 species and Nirvanopsis was for a long time
considered to be monobasic (previously as Nirvana), but
now includes a recently described species, N. susah. It
has been suggested that Mycalesis is probably paraphyletic with respect to Lohora [31], and that Nirvanopsis
might belong within Lohora [17]. Mycalesis was considered closely related to another Indo-Australian mycalesine genus Orsotriaena, but this has been refuted by
recent molecular studies [32,33]. Mycalesis differs from
Bicyclus by the presence of hairy eyes; dense interommatidal setae are absent in the latter [14]. Heteropsis
also has hairy eyes [7] but differs from Mycalesis in
details of wing venation and for most species, male genitalia [7]. Mycalesis was divided into several genera [12],
and into species groups by [34] and [29]. Additional file
1 provides more information on taxonomical revisions
and groupings of Asian and Australasian species.
The monophyly of genera and the relationships among
them have strong implications for our understanding of
their global diversification. Miller, whose study [11] was
largely based on an examination of leg morphometrics,
speculated that mycalesines started diverging in the
Oriental region from an ancestor which was initially
derived from Neotropical satyrines. According to his
scenario, Africa was colonized twice, once by a naked
eyed ancestor (leading to Bicyclus and Hallelesis) and by
a hairy eyed ancestor that eventually went on to disperse
into Madagascar (leading to Heteropsis) and went
extinct in Africa. Miller further speculated that the
hairy-eyed mycalesines dispersed into the Australasian
region. Based on their tree where the African Heteropsis
was nested within the Madagascan clade, Torres and
colleagues [8] suggested an alternate scenario where
Africa was colonized at least once from Madagascar.
Hostplant records for this group are scarce; the known
records are mainly from Poaceae, but also from Cyperaceae, Marantaceae and Zingiberaceae [35]. Most regional
groups tend to be restricted to the forested tracts of
lower altitudes [10,36,37], whereas in some regions such
as Madagascar there is elevational zonation along the
entire forest gradient [38]. Mycalesines are generally low
flying butterflies with weak to moderate dispersal abilities [8,25,39] (although the Heteropsis subgenera

Kodandaramaiah et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:172

Masoura and Admiratio are canopy species, as is Nirvanopsis) [40,41]. This low dispersal ability along with
habitat and bioclimatic fidelity renders several species
endemic to narrow regions [10,40]. With some exceptions, species are dull and cryptically coloured, bearing a
postdiscal series of eyespots (ocelli) on the dorsal and
ventral surfaces that are sometimes not expressed on
some wing surfaces or in both sexes. Species that
experience defined periods of wet and dry seasons have
a corresponding dry- and wet-season form [42]. This
polyphenism is characterized by the reduction of the
ventral eyespots in the dry season morph.
Mycalesines have been used extensively in various
ecological (e.g. [12,40,43,44]) and evolutionary studies
(e.g. [45-50]). Bicyclus in particular has carved a niche
for itself as a model organism in evolutionary biology,
with the eyespots in B. anynana having been the focus
of innumerable evo-devo studies (e.g. [51-54]). Almost
all species of Mycalesina possess eyespots, but, again,
the lack of robust phylogenies has hindered comparative
studies within a phylogenetic framework; the two
studies on Bicyclus [50], and [55], are the only such
studies so far.
No molecular study has incorporated sufficient species
from all mycalesine genera for a rigorous test of their
reciprocal monophyly. The two studies [8,27] were
focused on regional mycalesine faunas. The former study
did include a sample of the type species of Mycalesis,
M. francisca, but found no support for its placement.
These authors concluded that denser taxon sampling was
necessary to elucidate generic level relationships within
the group. In this study, we attempt to infer the phylogeny of Mycalesina using sequence data from three
genes. We also include 42 species of Mycalesis and seek
to identify major lineages within the genus and their relationships. We estimate lineage divergence times within
the group and attempt to reconstruct events in its
biogeographic history.

Results
Systematics

The combined dataset included 3139 base pairs (bp)
from 125 samples including seven outgroups. The MP
(Maximum Parsimony) analysis of the combined dataset
resulted in 80 equally most parsimonious trees, the strict
consensus of which is shown in Fig 1. The ML (Maximum Likelihood) analysis on the same dataset resulted
in a topology that differed at several nodes (Fig 2). However, these differences were mainly in the basal nodes
that were weakly supported in both analyses, and in the
ML tree, preceded by short branches. Nodes that were
well supported (>80% bootstrap values) in the ML analysis also figured in the MP topology, albeit with lower
support in general. Both analyses supported the

monophyly of Mycalesina (MP: 98% bootstrap; ML:
100% bootstrap). The BI (Bayesian Inference) tree was
different to both MP and ML, but incongruence was
restricted mainly to the basal part of the tree (Fig 3).
Nodes supported strongly in the ML analysis were
recovered with strong posterior probabilities in the
BI tree. Results that are consistent across the three
tree-building methods are elaborated below.
Bicyclus, Hallelesis and Nirvanopsis emerged as monophyletic groups in all three analyses whereas the remaining genera were either paraphyletic or polyphyletic. The
monophyly of Bicyclus was strongly supported in the
model-based analyses but only moderately so in MP.
Hallelesis and Nirvanopsis, each represented by two
species, were monophyletic with strong support. Nirvanopsis was nested within Lohora, rendering the latter
paraphyletic. Relationships among Heteropsis species
were broadly consistent with subgeneric groupings in
[7]. A group consisting of M. adolphei, M. janardana,
M. sangaica, M. mamerta and M. malsara was nested
within Heteropsis. The remaining Mycalesis species clustered into two clades, but Mycalesis as a whole was
polyphyletic.
Six higher clades within Mycalesina were common to
all three analyses, each with moderate to strong support
in the model-based analyses, but weaker support in MP.
These will be referred to as the stable clades and have
been named either with novel or available names to facilitate discussion (Figs 1, 2 and 3). Relationships within
these stable clades were similar, if not congruent,
between analyses (an exception is the unresolved nature
of Mycalesis clade II in MP). Some previously recognised
species groups (Additional file 1) in Mycalesis were also
recovered as well-supported clades. The Mineus group of
Evans (2-species group of Aoki and colleagues [29];
approximating to Calysisme of Moore plus Jatana) was
one such group, which includes M. mynois, M. perseus,
M. mineus, M. intermedia, M. perseoides and M. visala.
M. perseus is the most widely distributed Mycalesis species, ranging from the Indian subcontinent to NE Australia. The other members of the Mineus group are
restricted to the Oriental region. M. patnia (’4-species’
group of Aoki and colleagues [29]) was either nested
within or sister to the ‘1-species’ group (including M.
gotama, M. patnia, M. orseis, M. francisca and M. anaxias; equivalent respectively to Moore’s Sadarga, Nissanga, Suralaya, Gareris and Virapa). Members of these
three species groups together formed a stable clade,
which will be referred to as Mycalesis clade I.

M. dohertyi, M. maianeas, M. itys, M. fuscum and M. anapita formed another stable clade, hereafter referred to as
Mycalesis clade II (equivalent to Mydosama of Moore plus
Savanda, Nebdara, Satoa and possibly Culapa). The
Oriental genera within the clade were basal members,
while the Australasian species were a strongly supported
clade nested within. The other stable clades within Mycalesina are Lohora (Lohora + Nirvanopsis), Hallelesis, Bicyclus and Heteropsis (including some species of Mycalesis;
Fig 1, 2 &3).
ML analysis on the COI dataset recovered the six stable
clades (Additional file 2). Mycalesis clade II was nested
within Mycalesis clade I in the EF-1a tree, while the
remaining four stable clades were retrieved (Additional
file 3). The wingless tree was generally poorly-supported
with very short branches, but recovered the Heteropsis
and Lohora clades (Additional file 4). Hallelesis and Bicyclus were represented by a single species, whereas Mycalesis clades I and II were not monophyletic.
Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests

The likelihood score of the ML topology in Fig 2 (In L =
-38610.95571) was significantly higher than the “genus
monophyly” topology (ln L = -38702.28514), wherein
each genus was constrained to be monophyletic (P =
0.002, Shimodaira-Hasegawa test, Table 1). On the contrary, there was no significant difference in likelihood
scores between the ML topology and the tree where
Mycalesis clades I and II were reciprocally monophyletic.
’Rogue’ analysis

Each of the six stable clades was successively removed
and the resulting datasets subjected to RaxML analyses.
The resulting trees are summarized in Additional file 5.
We found that deleting any of the clades did not
increase support for basal nodes; nodes with <50% bootstrap values did not receive >50% support.
Divergence time estimates

The dating analysis in BEAST indicates that the ancestors of the six stable clades diverged between 26 and 21
mya (Fig 3) Initial splits within the Lohora, Bicyclus,
Mycalesis groups I and II began ca. 18-20 mya. The two
species of Hallelesis started diverging ca. 1.5 mya.

Discussion
Although we found several well-supported higher clades
within Mycalesina that were stable with respect to the
method of analysis, relationships between these clades
varied considerably between the analyses. Some of the
instability could perhaps be due to missing data for some
taxa. However, incongruent relationships were those that
were supported poorly in all analyses, which suggests
that the conflict between the methods is due to poor phylogenetic signal in the dataset. We believe that the basal
divergences have happened in rapid succession with little
time for synapomorphic changes to accumulate in the
intervening period between two successive splits [56,57].
This pattern is similar to that reported in other satyrine
groups [58,59]. Increasing the number of genes has been
shown to improve resolution of rapid radiations in some
cases, whilst some nodes remained poorly supported
despite adding data from multiple genes [60-62]. The
synergistic effect of the addition of morphological data to
molecular datasets has been demonstrated before [63].
However, morphology has not proved satisfactory for the
higher level classification of the group and it remains to
be seen whether addition of morphological characters
will resolve basal relationships, though we suspect that
these nodes will be difficult to resolve.
Although basal relationships are unresolved by the
current data we do find several well-supported evolutionary groups. The results call for major redefinitions
of mycalesine genera as well as illuminate aspects of the
biogeographic history of the group.
Systematic implications

We propose that the group of Mycalesis species nested
within Heteropsis should henceforth be classified under
Heteropsis. Mycalesis clades I and II were never sister to
each other in the combined analyses, although a topology with Mycalesis clades I and II constrained to be sister to each other was not significantly worse than the
ML topology (where they are not sister to each other).
Nevertheless, we propose that members of clade I and II
should be classified under two respective genera. The
genetic divergence between the clades is comparable to
the divergence between other genera in our study, supporting our re-classification scheme. Furthermore, the
two clades almost completely allopatric, with clade I
restricted to South and SE Asia, whereas clade 2 is predominantly Australasian. Moreover, even under the
unlikely event that these two clades indeed turn out to
be each others’ sisters with strong support, our proposed classification system would still remain valid.
Clade I includes the type species of the genus (M. francisca) and we propose that members of this clade should
be classified under Mycalesis sensu stricto. We transfer
the species in the Mycalesis Clade II to Mydosama (type

species, Dasyomma fuscum Felder & Felder, 1860). We
also subsume Nirvanopsis under Lohora.
Biogeography

It is important to bear in mind that our divergence time
estimates are based on a single secondary calibration
point (from [64]) and as such are a first approximation.
We here present our interpretation of the biogeographic
history of the group based on these timing estimates
and the strongly supported monophyletic groupings.
The age of the most recent common ancestor of Mycalesina suggested by the dating analysis precludes a
Gondwanan origin of the group. The most likely sister
clade of the group is composed of a group of genera distributed predominantly in the Oriental and the easternmost parts of Palaearctic region [59,64]. Miller’s
hypothesis [11] was that the ancestor of mycalesines was
of Oriental origin and the group diversified through dispersals to the Afrotropical and Australasian regions.
Mycalesis clade I emerged sister to remaining mycalesine clades in the ML tree, in support of Miller’s
hypothesis. However, the MP and BI trees retrieved the
African Bicyclus as sister to the rest of the mycalesines,
although without strong support for the latter group.
This would point to an African origin, as already shown
in two other nymphalid groups, Junonia and Charaxes
[6,65]. In this scenario, mycalesines started evolving in
Africa, with subsequent colonization of Madagascar
where there was explosive radiation of the Heteropsis
group, and this group subsequently invaded Asia. With
the poorly supported basal relationships, however, we
are unable to distinguish between hypotheses of African
and Asian origin. Nonetheless, it is clear that there has
been at least one dispersal event between the AfroMalagasy and Asian regions in the early evolution of the
group. This colonization(s) has most likely occurred
across the Arabian Peninsula, which is thought to have
been covered by forests at some point during the Miocene [66,67]. The Arabian Peninsular region appears to
have been important for butterflies as a corridor of ‘geodispersal’ (concordant dispersal of several lineages over
the same route) [68] between Africa and Asia.
The grouping of some Asian mycalesines with the
Afro-Malagasy genus Heteropsis is well supported by all
combined analyses and independently by the COI and
EF-1a datasets (note that the close relationship of
M. adolphei with Heteropsis is also supported by morphological data, in particular the form of the male genitalia; [7,18]). This grouping suggests at least one
dispersal event from the Afrotropical to the Oriental
Region, as the Oriental members are derived within the
Heteropsis group. Our trees also suggest tentatively
(although lacking support for the placement of Admiratio + Masoura) that the Madagascan mycalesines

Page 8 of 13

comprise two independent radiations (subgenera Admiratio+Masoura, and the clade including subgenera Heteropsis+Henotesia). Greater taxon and gene sampling
(note that Admiratio and Masoura are only represented
in our tree by COI) is therefore needed to establish a
robust topology for Heteropsis sensu lato that can lead
to a stronger inference of the biogeographic history
of the group. It is very probable that two species
(H. comorana and H. narcissus) have colonised the
Comoros and Mascarenes from Madagascar [18,26].
However, only one recent colonisation event is suggested from Africa; the secondary colonization of the
species B. anynana of Comoros [256].
Sulawesi has been colonised at least twice independently early in the evolution of Mycalesina (between ca.
24-19 mya), by the ancestors of the Lohora clade and of
M. itys. Interestingly, while Lohora has radiated into
19 species, the ancestor of M. itys seems not to have
undergone in situ speciation within the island (M. itys is
the only Mycalesis species endemic to Sulawesi).
The endemic Australasian fauna share a common
ancestor that was derived from the Oriental region. This
ancestor diversified rapidly in New Guinea, with the first
splits occurring ca. 15 mya. The endemics in the Solomon Islands (biliki-splendens-richardi-interrupta-sara)
descend from an ancestor derived from New Guinea in
the Late Miocene. M. terminus and M. sirius (Mycalesis
II clade) expanded their range into Australia from
New Guinea while M. perseus (Mycalesis I clade),
has colonized Australia and the Solomons between 1 and
2 mya.
Ecology and evolution

Although some mycalesine faunas, such as that now
represented as Clade I of SE Asia, tend to be rather
brownish or homogeneous in colour pattern, this is not
the case everywhere. The endemics in the Australasian
region and the Lohora clade of Sulawesi include more
colourful members, and may even be mimetic; in the
case of Mycalesis drusillodes so spectacularly that they
had been described as different species, the male mimicking a Tellervo and the female a Taenaris [13,14]. The
Malagasy fauna, in particular, is exceptionally diverse in
wing pattern and wing shape. There is also evidence for
mimicry between different clades of Heteropsis in Madagascar and between Heteropsis (Masoura) masoura (in
this case sexually monomorphic) and the aposematic
pierid Mylothris phileris [7]. Dead leaf mimicry is also
evident in the Malagasy Heteropsis drepana. The significance of these regional differences in colour pattern and
form in different faunas perhaps relates to aspects of the
environment, notably differing suites of predators [69],
but there is to date no experimental evidence of their
role. In Madagascar, mycalesines occurring in open areas

Kodandaramaiah et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:172
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/172

or on margins of forests are markedly more orange rather
than brown [7].
This remarkable inter-specific diversity in wing patterns may also have been mediated, at least partially, by
sexual selection. It has been shown experimentally that
eyespots on the dorsal surface of B. anynana are used
by females to choose mates [47,48]. Pronounced sexual
dimorphism occurs in some African Bicyclus, and especially within the Heteropsis subgenus Henotesia in
Madagascar, another case extreme enough that females
had not been been matched to males, neither had different seasonal stages of males been correctly synonymised
(but see [7,70]). Wing patterns are known to have sexspecific evolutionary rates within Bicyclus [50]. All these
lines of evidence point towards sexual selection as an
additional mediator of morphological diversification.
Results in [50] also suggested that mate signalling
selects for varying dorsal wing patterns while ventral
characters are selected upon by predation pressure.
Thus, a complex interaction of differential selective
forces along with the heterogeneity of environments
inhabited by these species seems to have driven the
morphological diversification of wing patterns in this
group, and much needs to be learnt about the systems.
The most striking aspect of diversification that may be
related to speciation in mycalesine butterflies is in the
scent organs, which are exceptionally diverse, including
male androconia on forewing underside, hindwing
upperside, abdominal underside and upperside, specialized wing veins, and specialized polished areas that may
have protective function [7]. These androconia are
known to release male sex pheromones during courtship, which are crucial determinants of reproductive isolation between species [71,72]. Even to humans,
mycalesine scent brushes differ in odour [7]. A denser
sampling is needed to test whether the exceptional
diversification of androconia is related to elevated levels
of speciation in this group. Our phylogeny provides a
starting point to identify groups that can be used for
further comparative analyses that seek to understand
the underlying processes that might have generated
these diverse characters.
From a biogeographic perspective, the moderate to
weak dispersive powers of mycalesine butterflies
explains some of their diversity, because poor dispersive
power is expected to be conducive towards higher rates
of allopatric speciation [73]. Dispersal into a novel area
is more likely to result in allopatric speciation compared
to a group with high vagility that can maintain regular
geneflow [73]. Vicariance events are also more likely to
result in speciation when the ancestor in question has
weak dispersive powers. For instance, the aridification of
central India during the Pliocene may have resulted in
vicariant events that left descendant sister species pairs

disjunct in South-West India and North-East India [74].
Unfortunately, we are unable to test this hypothesis with
our limited taxon sampling.
The radiation of Satyrini (Satyrinae) butterflies, to
which Mycalesina belongs, is thought to have closely followed the diversification of C4 grasses during the Oligocene [33]. Host-plant mediated speciation can occur due
to episodes of host-expansion and specialization during
the history of the group [75,76]. The degree of specialization of satyrines on their grass host plants is
unknown, but Mycalesis is one satyrine group where
host-plant preference hierarchy and specialization has
been reported [77]. A rigorous test of the hypothesis
that mycalesines radiated by co-evolving with their grass
hostplants is, however, hindered by the lack of reliable
host plant records for most mycalesines.
We surmise that a combination of several factors androconial diversification, sexual selection on wing patterns, moderate dispersive powers, and perhaps also
co-evolution with grasses - has resulted in the high
diversity of species in the group. In summary, this group
of butterflies presents an exciting opportunity to understand patterns and processes of diversification in insects,
especially in unravelling the complex interactions
among various selective forces and developmental
aspects of wing patterns. The phylogeny encompassing
the entire radiation and nomenclatural rationalisation at
a generic level presented here is the first step that will
eventually permit large-scale analyses to explore specific
hypotheses within a comparative framework.

Conclusions
Our phylogenetic hypothesis based on three genes indicates that Mycalesina radiated rapidly during the Oligocene-Miocene boundary. Their origin is as yet unclear,
and may be either in Asia or Africa, but they have
undergone dispersals between the two regions. Our
topology implies that Madagascar was colonized at least
twice, resulting in independent radiations, but it is not
yet certain if its role as a source area was limited to
colonisation of neighbouring islands. More clearly, the
Australasian mycalesine fauna have radiated following a
single dispersal event to the region. We propose a radically new classification of the group and discuss factors
likely to have played a key role in their diversification.
Our phylogeny paves the way for exciting comparative
studies that will help us understand the process of diversification of rapid radiations.
Methods
Data collection

Specimens of 42 species of Mycalesis, 28 of Heteropsis,
four of Lohora and two of Nirvanopsis were collected
either by the authors or collaborators at different times

Kodandaramaiah et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:172
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/172

between 2001 and 2008. 13 widespread species were
represented by more than one sample. DNA was preserved either through dessication or by immersing two
legs in alcohol. Once the samples reached the lab, DNA
was extracted from two legs using the DNEasy extraction kit (QIAgen). DNA was amplified from three gene
regions - 1450 bp (base pairs) of COI (cytochrome oxidase subunit I), a mitochondrial gene, and two nuclear
genes - EF-1a (Elongation Factor 1 alpha; 1240 bp) and
wingless (400 bp). The gene trio has been successful in
resolving relationships of species within a genus in several nymphalid studies [65,78-81].
Readers are referred to [82] for a list of primer
sequences used here. COI was amplified using the primer pairs LCO-HCO and Jerry-Pat. Three primer pairs
were used for EF-1a - Starsky-Luke, Cho-Verdi and
EF51.9-EFrcM4, while LepWing1 and LepWing2 or
Wingnut 1A (5’-GAA ATG CGN CAR GAR TGY AA3’) and Wingnut-3 (5’-ACY TCR CAR CAC CAR TGR
AA-3’) were used for wingless. The PCR protocol used
for Starsky-Luke was as follows -95°C for 7 min,
40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s and 72°C for
1 min followed by a final extension period of 72°C for
10 min. For Wingnut 1A-Wingnut 3, conditions were
80°C for 1 min, 40 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 46-52°C for
2 min and 72°C for 1-2 min followed by a final extension period of 72°C for 10 min. For the remaining five
primer pairs, we used the following protocol: 95°C for 7
min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s and 72°C
for 1 min followed by a final extension period of 72°C
for 10 min. Successfully amplified PCR products were
sequenced with a Beckmann-Coulter CEQ8000 automated sequencer. The resulting chromatograms were
visualized in BioEdit v7.0.5.3 [83] and aligned by eye.
We also included sequence data from the genera Bicyclus, Heteropsis and Hallelesis that were available on
Genbank. Outgroup data were taken from [32]. Additional file 5 lists the samples used in this study with
their collection localities and Genbank accession numbers for respective sequences.
Phylogenetic inference

The combined dataset was analyzed under the maximum parsimony (MP) criterion in TNT v 1.1 [84].
Heuristic searches including traditional TBR branch
swapping procedures and ‘New Technology’ searches
were performed on 1000 random addition replicates.
Support for respective clades was estimated using bootstrap values calculated from 1000 pseudo-replicates with
10 replicates each. Maximum likelihood (ML) analyses
were performed in RAxML III [85] with default heuristic
search algorithms. The GTR+G model, which was chosen by jModelTest [86] under the Akaike Information
Criterion, was imposed on the three gene partitions

Page 10 of 13

independently with the gamma parameter estimated in
4 discrete rate categories. Bootstrap values were calculated from 1000 pseudo-replicates. Since some samples
did not have a complete three-gene dataset (Additional
file 6), ML analyses were performed on individual gene
datasets excluding samples missing data for respective
genes. Individual gene analyses also allow us to assess
nodal support from each gene.
We performed Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests [87] to test
whether specific topologies resulting from the above
analyses were significantly better than competing topologies. The program MacClade [88] was used to construct two constraint trees; in the first tree each genus
were forced to be monophyletic and in the second tree
only species in Mycalesis clades I and II (see results)
were placed in a monophyletic group, while the position
of other species remained unconstrained. These constraint trees were used in PAUP* [89] to derive a “genus
monophyly” tree and “Mycalesis monophyly” tree
through a likelihood heuristic search. To examine support for the above hypotheses the likelihood scores of
these trees were compared with the unconstrained ML
tree using the one-tailed Shimodaira-Hasegawa log-likelihood test as implemented in PAUP*, using the re-sampling estimated log-likelihood (RELL) technique
approximation with 10,000 bootstrap replications. These
analyses were implemented on the combined dataset.
We also conducted a ‘rogue’ analysis to test whether
there was one or more ‘rogue’ clades that was leading to
the observed low basal support values. Each of the six
‘stable’ clades identified in the Results section was successively removed and the datasets analysed in RaxML
with bootstrapping to test whether deletion of one of
these clades resulted in stronger support.
Estimate of divergence times

We used the software BEAST v 1.4.8 [90] for Bayesian
inference (BI) of phylogenetic relationships and divergence times simultaneously. The analysis was carried out
without outgroups since BEAST does not rely on outgroups to root the tree; instead it uses a relaxed molecular clock. The “treeModel.RootHeight” prior (i.e., the age
at the root of the tree) was set to a normal distribution
with a mean of 27 million years and a standard deviation
of 3. This date was taken from [64] which studied the
divergence times within Nymphalidae based on a 10-gene
dataset from >400 genera (including Mycalesis, Bicyclus,
Hallelesis and Heteropsis), with both minimum and maximum calibration points. The dataset was partitioned into
nuclear (EF-1a and wingless combined) and mitochondrial (COI) genes, with parameter values estimated independently for each partition. The GTR+G model was
imposed with a relaxed clock where branch lengths were
allowed to vary according to an uncorrelated lognormal

Kodandaramaiah et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:172
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/172

distribution [91]. The tree prior was set to the BirthDeath process, while all other priors were left to their
defaults in BEAST. The analysis was run twice for
10,000,000 generations of MCMC analyses in BEAST
and the chains were sampled at every 1,000 generations,
yielding a total of 10,000 samples for each run. Whether
the parameter estimates and tree topology were at equilibrium was determined by using the program Tracer [91].
The first 1,000,000 generations (or 1000 trees) were discarded as burn-in.
