Unification of Cas protein families and a simple
scenario for the origin and evolution of CRISPRCas systems
Kira S Makarova, L Aravind, Yuri I Wolf and Eugene V Koonin*

Abstract
Background: The CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity systems that are present in most Archaea and many Bacteria
function by incorporating fragments of alien genomes into specific genomic loci, transcribing the inserts and using
the transcripts as guide RNAs to destroy the genome of the cognate virus or plasmid. This RNA interference-like
immune response is mediated by numerous, diverse and rapidly evolving Cas (CRISPR-associated) proteins, several
of which form the Cascade complex involved in the processing of CRISPR transcripts and cleavage of the target
DNA. Comparative analysis of the Cas protein sequences and structures led to the classification of the CRISPR-Cas
systems into three Types (I, II and III).
Results: A detailed comparison of the available sequences and structures of Cas proteins revealed several
unnoticed homologous relationships. The Repeat-Associated Mysterious Proteins (RAMPs) containing a distinct form
of the RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) domain, which are major components of the CRISPR-Cas systems, were
classified into three large groups, Cas5, Cas6 and Cas7. Each of these groups includes many previously
uncharacterized proteins now shown to adopt the RAMP structure. Evidence is presented that large subunits
contained in most of the CRISPR-Cas systems could be homologous to Cas10 proteins which contain a
polymerase-like Palm domain and are predicted to be enzymatically active in Type III CRISPR-Cas systems but
inactivated in Type I systems. These findings, the fact that the CRISPR polymerases, RAMPs and Cas2 all contain
core RRM domains, and distinct gene arrangements in the three types of CRISPR-Cas systems together provide for
a simple scenario for origin and evolution of the CRISPR-Cas machinery. Under this scenario, the CRISPR-Cas system
originated in thermophilic Archaea and subsequently spread horizontally among prokaryotes.
Conclusions: Because of the extreme diversity of CRISPR-Cas systems, in-depth sequence and structure comparison
continue to reveal unexpected homologous relationship among Cas proteins. Unification of Cas protein families
previously considered unrelated provides for improvement in the classification of CRISPR-Cas systems and a
reconstruction of their evolution.

Background
The CRISPR-Cas is an adaptive immunity system that is
present in most archaea and many bacteria, and functions
on a “Lamarckian inheritance” principle. The CRISPR-Cas
loci in prokaryote genomes consist of an array of direct,
typically palindromic repeats known as CRISPR (Clustered

Regularly Interspaced Short Palindrome Repeats) and
unique spacers located between the CRSIPR repeats [1].
The CRISPR repeat arrays are usually associated with cas
(CRISPR-associated) genes which encode proteins with a
variety of predicted nucleic acid-manipulating activities
such as nucleases, helicases and polymerases [1,2]. The
striking feature of the CRISPR loci is that some of the
unique spacers in the CRISPR repeat cassettes are identical
to fragments of viral (bacteriophage) genes [3,4]. This finding together with the predicted activities of the Cas

proteins prompted the hypothesis that CRISPR-Cas is a
system of adaptive immunity that integrates short genomic
segments of selfish elements (viruses or plasmids) into
specific loci in prokaryotic genomes and then employs
these inserts to abrogate the replication of the cognate
agents via a RNAi-like mechanism [5].
These predictions attracted the attention of several
research groups resulting in considerable experimental
support for the above hypothesis [6]. These studies have
elucidated many important details of the molecular
mechanisms of the CRISPR-Cas systems and the three
distinct functional stages of their operation [7,8]. During
the first stage, adaptation, short pieces of DNA (characteristic length of approximately 30 bp) homologous to
virus or plasmid sequences (known as proto-spacers) are
integrated into the CRISPR loci [6,9,10]. The short (3 or
4 nucleotides) proto-spacer adjacent motifs (PAMs)
located immediately downstream of the proto-spacer
appear to determine the selection of the protospacer followed by integration into a pre-existing CRISPR array
[11,12]. The second stage, expression and processing,
involves transcription and cleavage of long primary transcript of a CRISPR locus (pre-crRNA) that is processed
into short crRNAs. This step is catalyzed by endoribonucleases encoded by the cas genes that either operate as a
subunit of a larger complex (e.g. Cascade, CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense in Escherichia coli
[13]) or as a stand-alone enzyme, e.g., Cas6 in the
archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus [14,15]. At the third stage,
interference, the alien nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) is targeted by a ribonucleoprotein complex containing a
crRNA guide and a set of Cas proteins, and cleaved
within or in the vicinity of the PAM sequence [7,9,10,16].
In several CRISPR-Cas systems, crRNA have been shown
to be complementary to either strand of the phage or
plasmid which is best compatible with DNA being the
target [6,17]. Direct demonstration of DNA being the target of the CRISPR-Cas machinery has come from experiments in Staphylococcus epidermidis. In this case,
insertion of a self-splicing intron into the proto-spacer
sequence of the target gene rendered the respective plasmid resistant to the CRISPR-mediated immunity [18].
Recently, the E. coli Cascade complex containing crRNA
has been shown to recognize the target DNA, with the
specificity defined by the crRNA sequence, and displace
the non-complementary strand in an energy-independent
manner [8]. However, in vitro experiments with one of
the CRISPR-Cas systems (Type IIIB, formerly known as
Cmr system or RAMP module) from the archaeon P. furiosus showed that the crRNA rather targets the mRNA
[15]; it remains to be determined whether this is also the
case in vivo or the P. furiosus CRISPR-Cas systems target
alien DNA in addition to or instead of mRNA. In any

case, these findings emphasize the remarkable mechanistic and functional diversity of the CRISPR-Cas systems.
The apparent functional diversity of CRISPR-Cas systems is paralleled by the equally notable diversity of Cas
proteins: at least 45 distinct protein families have been
identified in association with CRISPR loci in various bacterial and archaeal genomes [19]. An analysis involving
more sensitive methods of sequence comparison and additional evidence from genomic context has revealed distant
homologous relationships between several of these
families, suggesting that even more Cas protein families
might be linked subsequently thanks to the growth of
genomic and structural data sets and further advances in
computational analysis [5].
The recently updated classification of CRISPR-Cas systems divides them into three distinct types (I, II and III)
[20]. All these systems contain two universal genes: cas1, a
metal-dependent DNAse with no sequence specificity that
could be involved in the integration of the alien DNA
(spacer) into CRISPR cassettes [21,22], and cas2, a metaldependent endoribonuclease, that also appears to be
involved in the spacer acquisition stage [23]. Otherwise,
the three types of CRISPR-Cas systems substantially differ
in their sets of constituent genes, and each is characterized, respectively, by a unique signature gene. The signature genes for the three types are, respectively, cas3 (a
superfamily 2 helicase containing an N-terminal HD
superfamily nuclease domain) [24]), cas9 (a large protein
containing a predicted RuvC-like and HNH nuclease
domains) and cas10 (a protein containing a domain homologous the palm domain of nucleic acid polymerases and
nucleotide cyclases) [20]. Within these three types,
CRISPR-Cas systems can be further classified into subtypes based on a number of considerations that include
distinct signature genes along with the phylogeny of the
universal cas1 gene [20]. The Cas proteins known as
RAMPs (Repeat-Associated Mysterious Proteins) are present in several copies in both type I and III systems. Some
of the RAMPs have been shown to possess sequence- or
structure-specific RNAse activity that is involved in the
processing of pre-crRNA transcripts [13,14,17]. The crystal structures of several RAMPs have been solved and indicate that they contain one or two domains which display
distinct versions of the RNA recognition motif (RRM) or
ferredoxin fold [5,16,17,25,26]. The experimentally characterized activities and functions of the key Cas proteins are
listed in Table 1.
Despite the recent progress in understanding the relationships between various Cas proteins, over 30 Cas
protein families apparently do not display similarity with
each other [20]. Here we present an analysis of these
proteins families that reveals several previously unnoticed relationships. We then use the results of this

Results and discussion
The RAMPs
Cas7 represents a distinct major group of RAMPs

Cas7 (COG1857) is present in most of the type I
CRISPR-Cas systems. Previously, members of this family
have been confidently identified in the I-A, I-B, I-C, I-E
systems [5]. As part of the recent update of the classification of CRISPR-Cas systems, we performed exhaustive
sequence database searches for all Cas protein families
using the HHpred profile against profile search method
[27]. These searches revealed statistically significant
similarity between Cas7 family proteins and various
RAMP families [for example, the search with the query
sequence ST0029 of the Cas7 (formerly known as DevR/
Csa2 family) from Sulfolobus tokodaii, identifies the
TIGR02581 profile for SSO1426 (or Csm3, COG1337)
family RAMP with a probability of 0.93 and many other
RAMP families with lower scores]. The reciprocal search
started from the SSO1426 protein sequence hits the

PFAM profile PF01905 which corresponds to the Cas7
family (probability 0.97). We used the alignments
obtained during these and other searches started from
other query sequences along with secondary structure
predictions to construct multiple alignments for Cas7
and a number of most closely related RAMP subfamilies
(Figure 1). In all these proteins, HHpred identifies several conserved blocks including the characteristic glycine-rich loop, based on both secondary structure and
sequence conservation (Figure 1). In addition, the Nterminal beta strand (the first strand of the RRM fold)
that is an essential structural feature of the RAMPs
(Additional File 1) could be identified based on the secondary structure prediction. In the Cas7 group RAMP
typical of Type I CRISPR-Cas systems, the signature glycine-rich (G-rich) loop of RAMPs is notably eroded.
However, the characteristic structural organization of
this region, namely the alpha-helix and the beta-strand
that flank the glycine-rich loop at the N- and C- termini, respectively, in other RAMPs, seems to be present
in these proteins. Collectively, these observations indicate that Cas7 proteins present in the I-A, I-B, I-C, and
I-E CRISPR-Cas system subtypes comprise a distinct
family within the RAMP superfamily.

Figure 1 Multiple alignment of Cas7 subfamilies and related families of RAMPs. The multiple sequence alignment includes the conserved
blocks identified by HHpred (red box), secondary structure predictions and the secondary structure elements extracted from the crystal structure
of the Cas7 from S. solfataricus [16]. Secondary structure prediction showed as follows: ‘H’ indicates a-helix, ‘E’ indicates extended conformation
(b-strand). The sequences are denoted by their GI numbers and species names. G-rich loop region of RAMPs is shown by blue box. The
positions of the first and the last residues of the aligned region in the corresponding protein are indicated for each sequence. The numbers
within the alignment represent poorly conserved inserts that are not shown. The coloring is based on the consensus shown underneath the
alignment; ‘h’ indicates hydrophobic residues (WFYMLIVACTH), ‘p’ indicates polar residues (EDKRNQHTS), ‘s’ indicates small residues (ACDGNPSTV).

After these analyses have been performed, the crystal
structure of Cas7 (Csa2) from the Crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus has been reported [16]. Examination of
this structure clearly demonstrates the presence of a single RAMP domain that contains four inserts within the
RRM core and a C-terminal extension. None of these
additional domains of Cas7 show sequence or structural
similarity to any known domains [16].
Classification and evolution of RAMPs

The demonstration that the Cas7 family belongs to the
RAMP superfamily prompted us to further investigate
the relationships between the RAMPs. We performed
DALI searches with all available RAMP structures
(Figure 2 and Additional File 2) and HHpred searches
using representatives of 19 RAMP families, and collected
similarity scores between the corresponding profiles
(Additional File 3). For each family we predicted

secondary structure or assigned secondary structure elements from the known structures of RAMPs (Additional
File 1). Combining the results of these analyses, we classify the RAMP superfamily into three major groups:
Cas5, Cas6 and Cas7 (Figure 3).
The Cas5 group RAMPs (Cas5/COG1688, Cmr3/
COG1769, Csm4/COG1567, Csy2, Csc1) were unified on
the basis of sequence similarity that in most cases was
identifiable by HHpred and the presence of a C-terminal
domain downstream of the G-rich loop (Figure 2). For
some of these C-terminal domains, an RRM fold can be
predicted (Additional File 3). For example, in the Cmr3
subfamily (Subtype III-B), the predicted secondary structure elements of the C-terminal domain are compatible
with the RRM arrangement (Additional File 1). Moreover,
this domain ends with a second G-rich loop whereas in
the Csm4 subfamily from type III-A CRISPR-Cas systems

Figure 2 The RRM fold of RAMPs and Cas2. The RRM fold domains of Cas2 and the three major RAMP groups proposed in the text are
shown in cartoon representation with their N- and C- termini indicated. In Cas7, the insertions into the core of the RRM fold are shown in a
darker shade. In the RAMPs with two RRM fold domains, these are respectively labeled as N(-terminal) and C(-terminal). The distinct C-terminal
domains of Cas5 and Cas6f (Csy4) are also shown. In Cas6f, the glycine-rich loop, which is embedded in a beta-hairpin in contrast to the typical
helix-strand element, is colored orange. Note the “horizontal” packing of the first helix of the core RRM fold against the 4 strand sheet, which is
one of the characteristic structural features of the RAMPs (apparent in Cas7, Cas6, Cas6e and Cas5). The following PDB ids were used to generate
these representations: 2I0X (Cas2);_3PS0 (Cas7); 3I4H (Cas6); 1WJ9 (Cas6e/CasE); 3KG4(Cas5); 2XLJ (Cas6f/Csy4).

(the closest homolog of the Cmr3 family), this loop is
almost completely degraded (Additional File 1). The proteins of the Csx10 subfamily that is also related to Cmr3/
Csm4, contain two predicted RRM domains followed by a
clearly identifiable G-rich loop (Additional File 1). The

Csx10 subfamily can be unequivocally linked to the Cas5
group and specifically to Cmr3 and Csm4 families through
HHpred searches (the best hit for a representative of the
family Rcas_3289 from Roseiflexus castenholzii is the
pfam09700 profile for Cmr3 with the probability of 99%.)

Figure 3 Classification of the RAMPs. The tree-like scheme of RAMP relationships is based on the sequence similarity, structural features and
neighborhood analysis described in the text, and should not be construed as a phylogenetic tree. Unresolved relationships are shown as
multifurcations and tentative assignments are shown by broken lines. The catalytic activity of some of the RAMP proteins of the Cas5 and Cas7
groups involving the partially conserved histidines shown in the figure should be considered a tentative prediction.

The remaining Cas5 proteins including Cas5 proper, Csy2,
Csc1 and Csf3 contain a single N-terminal RRM domain
that terminates with the G-rich loop and is followed by a
distinct C-terminal beta-meander domain. Thus, the large
Cas5 group of RAMPs consists of two distinct subgroups
one of which contains two RRM domains and the other
one contains only one RRM domain (Figure 2). It remains
uncertain as to which is the ancestral form, i.e. whether
the ancestor of the Cas5 group already contained two
RRM domains, and the C-terminal one was lost or
severely deteriorated in one of the subgroups, or the
ancestral form possessed a single RRM domain that was
duplicated in one of the subgroups.
The Cas6 group includes Cas6 proteins proper
(COG1853/COG5551) that have been experimentally
characterized as the CRISPR transcript processing RNA
endonucleases [13,14,26,28] as well as highly diverged

homologs from the I-E (Cas6e) and I-F (Cas6f) CRISPRCas subtypes. This grouping is supported by the available structures and is compatible with the reported
functions for the representatives of each family. Most of
the Cas6 proteins encompass two well-defined RRM
domains which are connected by a “flange” in the
extended conformation and have a glycine-rich loop
upstream of the last strand of the second RRM fold
domain. Thus, the ancestor of the Cas6 group can be
confidently inferred to have possessed two RRM
domains. However, the Cas6f proteins contain a typical
N-terminal RRM domain and a distinct C-terminal
domain that displays certain topological features reminiscent of the RRM fold (see Additional file 1 and 2)
and contains a C-terminal G-rich loop but does not
show significant sequence or structural similarity to any
RRM domains (Figure 2). This domain could be either a

Makarova et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:38
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/38

grossly distorted RRM or a distinct beta-meander that
convergently acquired the G-rich loop.
The Cas7 group includes Cas7 proper (COG1857) and a
variety of RAMPs mostly associated with the Type III
CRISPR-Cas systems. All of these proteins contain a single
RRM domain with additional elaborations as demonstrated by the recently reported Cas7 structure (Figure 2),
sequence comparison and secondary structure prediction.
The Type III RAMP families (Csm3/COG1337 and Csm5/
COG1332 in subtype III-A; Cmr6/COG1604, Cmr4/
COG1336, Cmr1/COG1367 in subtype III-B; Csc2 in subtype I-D and Csf2 from the system of unknown subtype)
are more similar to each other (Additional File 3) than to
Cas7 but share with Cas7 a number of conserved sequence
motifs (Figure 1 and Additional File 1), the overall
sequence similarity identifiable by HHpred (Additional
File 3) and the absence of the additional RRM domain
after the G-rich loop (or its counterpart). The Csy3 subfamily is tentatively included in this group based on the
secondary structure prediction (no extension after the
G-rich loop compatible with another RRM domain). Some
members of the Cas7 group, such as Cmr1, contain a second predicted RRM domain. Furthermore, the RAMPs of
the Cas7 group show a tendency for gene duplication at
least in Type III CRISPR-Cas systems.
The only RAMP family that could not be confidently
assigned to any of the three groups is Csf3: despite
some weak sequence similarity to both Cas6 and Cas5
in the G-rich loop region, these proteins contain fewer
predicted beta-strands than Cas6 or Cas7 and no predicted RRM domain downstream of the G-rich loop;
although the latter feature resembles the organization of
Cas7, there is otherwise no similarity between these
proteins.
The diversity and weak conservation of the sequences
and structures of the RAMPs hamper the elucidation of
the evolutionary relationships between the three major
groups. Structural comparisons seem to suggest a specific
affinity between the Cas6 and Cas7 groups [16]. From a
different standpoint, the most parsimonious evolutionary
scenario might involve an ancestral RAMP with a single
enzymatically active RRM domain, resembling Cas7, and
a single duplication in the putative common ancestor of
the Cas5 and Cas6 groups, with subsequent deterioration
or displacement of the C-terminal RRM domains in several Cas5 and Cas6 lineages (Figure 3). Under this scenario, the similarity between Cas7 and Cas6 would reflect
ancestral structural features.
The characteristic arrangement of RAMPs in CRISPR-Cas
operons

Mapping the new classification of RAMPs described in
the preceding section onto the operons of the type I
and type III CRISPR-Cas systems reveals a common pattern of organization. Most subtypes of the Type I

Page 7 of 27

CRISPR-Cas systems encode one RAMP of the Cas5,
Cas6 and Cas7 groups each. Operons of type III
CRISPR-Cas system are organized similarly except that
they typically encode multiple Cas7 group RAMPs.
Notably, cas5 and a cas7 usually form a pair of adjacent
genes (Additional File 4). Remarkably, the Cas5 and
Cas7 orthologs in two distinct CRSIPR-Cas systems
belong to the stable core of the CASCADE complex
both in E. coli (Type I-E) [7,8] and in S. solfataricus
(Type I-A) [16]. In the unclassified (U-type) CRISPRCas system, operons that contain no cas5, a cas7 (csf2)
gene is located adjacent to the csf3 gene suggesting that
Csf3 is a truncated derivative of Cas5 (Additional File
4). In the unclassified (Type U) CRISPR-Cas systems
that contain no cas5, a cas7 (csf2) gene is located adjacent to the csf3 gene suggesting that in these systems
Csf3 could play a role comparable to that of Cas5.
(Additional File 4).
Enzymatic activities and catalytic sites of the RAMPs

Endoribonculease activity involved in CRISPR transcript
processing has been demonstrated for four proteins of
the Cas6 group, namely the E. coli CasE (Cse3), Cas6
from the archaea Pyrococcus furiosus and S. sulfataricus,
and Cas6f (Csy4) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All
these enzymatically active Cas6 proteins contain a conserved motif centered at the catalytic histidine, and a
similar motif is found in many RAMP families of both
Cas5 and Cas7 groups, especially from type III CRISPRCas systems (Figure 3 and see Additional File 1). In most
cases, including Cmr4 (COG1336), Cmr6 (COG1604),
Csm3 (COG1337), Csm5 (COG1332), Csm4 (COG1567),
and MA1928-like families, this motif is located immediately after the predicted first beta-strand of the RRM
domain, similarly to the catalytic histidine of Cas6.
Despite the weak sequence similarity between the three
groups of RAMPs, the presence of the conserved histidine in many members of each group and in nearly identical positions within the RRM domain suggests that this
is an ancestral feature and accordingly the original
RAMP most likely was an active endoribonculease.
In addition to the catalytic histidine, the enzymatically
active Cas6 protein of P. furiosus contains a lysine and a
tyrosine residues that are essential for the activity and are
thought to comprise the catalytic triad of this enzyme
together with the conserved histidine [14]. However,
these amino acids are not conserved other than in close
relatives of P. furiosus Cas6. Although several of the
other RAMP families also possess conserved polar or aromatic residues that potentially could contribute to a catalytic triad similar to that of the Cas6 endonucleases (see
Additional File 1), the exact architecture of the catalytic
site of this RAMPs is currently difficult to predict.
Several RAMPs in each of the three major groups contain a motif with a conserved histidine in the C-terminal

Makarova et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:38
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/38

portion of the RRM domain. At this time, it remains
unclear whether any of the RAMPs that lack the conserved histidine in the N-terminal part but contain other
(not homologous to the known catalytic ones) conserved
histidines closer to the C-terminus (Figure 3 and Additional File 1) are catalytically active.
Given that the Cas6 group RAMPs are dedicated
nucleases for the processing of the CRISPR transcripts
(pre-crRNA) that produce the crRNAs and appear to be
sufficient for this function [13,14,28], most of the other
RAMPs might be involved in non-enzymatic functions in
the respective Cascade complexes. However, the possibility remains that some of these RAMPs are involved in
crRNA-guided mRNA interference. Indeed, mRNA cleavage has been experimentally demonstrated in vitro for
the Type III CRISPR-Cas system from Pyrococcus furiosus [15]. Furthermore, in some CRISPR-Cas systems,
catalytically active RAMPs of the Cas5 or Cas7 groups
might substitute for the Cas6 activity. For example, in the
type I-C systems that lack cas6, the Cas5 family proteins
contain a conserved histidine in the C-terminal region of
the protein that jointly with other aromatic and charged
residues that are conserved in subfamily of RAMPs might
contribute to the catalytic site of these proteins (see
Additional File 1).
Gene content similarity between Type I and Type III
CRISPR-Cas systems

The new classification of RAMPs and the common
arrangement of RAMP genes in the operons for type I
and type III CRISPR-Cas systems emphasize the considerable conservation of organization of the genes encoding
(potential) Cascade subunits. The overall organization of
the cas operon is especially similar between the I-E and
III-A subtypes (Figure 4A). Both systems have been
experimentally characterized, I-E in Escherichia coli [13]
and III-A in Staphylococcus epidermidis [12,18], and
shown to be fully functional. The Type I-E system consists of 9 components, and the Type III-A system
includes 10 components (counting the HD superfamily
nuclease domains fused to different genes separately). Six
genes (domains) of the I-E system, namely cas1, cas2,
cas3’’(HD), cas7, cas5 and cas6e, are clearly homologous
to cas1, cas2, cas3’’(HD), csm3, csm4 and cas6 of III-A
respectively (III-A contains and additional homolog of
cas7, csm5). Although for the small alpha helical proteins
Cse2 and Csm2, sequence similarity cannot be readily
detected, they share several similar motifs [5] and might
be homologous as well. There are two genes for which
there seems to be no counterpart in the other system.
One is the Cas3 helicase-nuclease which is unique for
Type I systems, and the other is Csm6 which is loosely
associated with the CRISPR-Cas systems. The Csm6 protein has been structurally characterized; it contains an

Page 8 of 27

HTH domain and probably is a regulatory protein, most
likely not involved in the basic CRISPR-Cas mechanism
[29].
The large protein Cse1 in the I-E system is a subunit of
the Cascade complex [13] and so is the Cas10 protein
(CRISPR Polymerase) in P. furiosus [15]. Furthermore,
Cse1 has a similar size to Cas10 (without the HD domain;
Figure 4A). Thus, it seems tempting to speculate that
Cse1 might be a homolog of Cas10. As the Cse1 family
proteins do not contain any motifs implicated in catalysis
in the predicted Cas10 polymerase, Cse1 would be an
inactivated enzyme should it be demonstrated that it is
indeed a Cas10 homolog.
Putative homology between the large and small subunits
of different type I and type III CRISPR-Cas systems

Among the large subunits of Type I CRISPR-Cas systems, sequence conservation has been demonstrated
previously [5] for several subfamilies of the Cas8 family
(Cas8a1/Csa6, a subfamily of subtype I-A; Cas8b/Csh1/
Cst1, a subfamily of subtype I-B; and Cas8c/Csd1, a subfamily of subtype I-C). Here, using HHpred and PSIBLAST, we linked several other subfamilies to the Cas8
family: Cmx1/Csx13/LA3191 associated with some
diverged variants of I-C subtype and Cas8a2 (Csa4/Csx9
subfamily) associated with some I-A subtype systems.
For example, HHpred identifies the profile for Cas8a2
(Csa4) with probability 0.42 using the FRAAL5579
sequence from Frankia alni (subfamily Cas8a1/Cst1) as
the query and profile TIGR02556 for Cas8a (Cst1 subfamily) with probability 0.83 using the M23134_00692
sequence (Cmx1/Csx13/LA3191 subfamily) from Microscilla marina as the query. The large Cascade subunit of
subtype I-D shows similarity to the Zn-finger regions of
the Cas8b/Cst1of I-B system and additionally is fused to
an HD domain analogously to the type III Cas10 proteins. The large subunits of the I-E (Cse1) and I-F
(Csy1) subtypes do not show any sequence similarity to
one another (despite the fact that these systems are
related by the Cas1 phylogeny and the cas gene sets) or
to any Cas8 family proteins.
Type III systems contain several subfamilies of Cas10
(Csm1, Cmr2 and Csx11 according to [19]) that have
been denoted CRISPR polymerases because of their
similarity to the Palm/Cyclase domain [2,30,31]. The
CRISPR polymerase consists of several domains, namely,
the HD domain (predicted nuclease), a distinct domain
so far unique to this protein family, a Zn-finger domain,
and a region containing the Palm domain, the signature
domain of various polymerases and cyclases which
adopts a distinct RRM fold [2]. The Palm domain of
CRISPR polymerases is more similar to the Palm
domain of cyclases than to those of 3’-5’ DNA and RNA
polymerases, and contains all typical secondary structure

elements including four beta-strands of the core RRM
fold [31]. Many structures of Palm domain-containing
polymerases from all domains of life and numerous
viruses have been solved and compared [32]. Most of
these polymerases show a common arrangement of core
domains and the same modes of nucleic acid binding;
the polymerases additionally contain a variety of editing
nuclease domains and regulatory domains. The core
domains (usually arranged in the same order from the
N-terminus to the C-terminus) are the following: the
“Fingers” domain that binds a nucleotide, the catalytic
“Palm” domain “Palm” that binds single-stranded nucleic
acid, and the “Thumb” domain that binds doublestranded nucleic acid [32].
Despite this structural and mechanistic similarity, only
the Palm domains of these numerous polymerase
families are clearly homologous [32,33]. The most conserved feature of the Palm domains is the beta-hairpin
formed by strands 2 and 3 of the RRM fold [33,34]. The
thumb domain is usually enriched in alpha helices some
of which interact directly with the DNA or RNA duplex
[32].
To analyze and compare the sequence and structural
features of the large subunits of type I and type III systems (Cas8 and Cas10 [predicted CRISPR polymerases],
respectively), we constructed a multiple alignment of
representative sequences and predicted the secondary
structure using the JPRED program (Figure 4B) (Additional File 5). A detailed analysis of the C-terminal
region of CRISPR polymerases (starting immediately
after the Zn-binding treble clef domain) showed that a
region consisting mostly of alpha-helices follows the
fourth strand of the RRM fold of the Palm domain
(Region 5 in Additional File 5). This arrangement is
consistent with the general structure of Palm-domain
polymerases described above and suggests that this
region of the CRISPR polymerases could be equivalent
to the Thumb domain of other polymerases. Furthermore, given that the core Palm domain is rather compact in these proteins, the region located after the HD
nuclease domain and upstream of the Zn-binding
domain (Region 2 in Additional File 5) might be an
equivalent of the Fingers domain.
Most of the large subunits of different subtypes of Type
I CRISPR-Cas systems contain a readily identifiable Znfinger domain in the middle of the protein sequence [5].
If the large subunits are highly diverged, inactivated
Palm-domain containing polymerases as proposed above,
and the Zn-finger is equivalent to the treble-clef domain
found in the CRISPR polymerase, one should expect that
a domain containing several beta-strands compatible
with the general structure of the Palm-domain followed
by an alpha helical region would be located downstream
of the Zn-finger. Indeed, in various subfamilies of Cas8,

Page 10 of 27

Cas10d, inactivated Cas10 (Csx11 subfamily) and Cse1,
we observed the same structural pattern, namely, at least
three predicted beta-strands that could belong to a RRM
fold, including the core beta-hairpin, followed by an
alpha-helical region (Regions 4 and 5 in Additional File
5). Because two other subfamilies (Csy1 and Cmx1) do
not contain Zn-fingers, it is difficult to map the beginning of the putative Palm-domain within these
sequences. However, we detected sequence similarity
between Cmx1 and Cas8 (see above) and given that
Cmx1 proteins possess an alpha-helical C-terminal
domain (Regions 4 and 5, Additional File 5), it seems
likely that Cmx1 is homologous to Cas8. The Csy1 protein might be homologous to Cse1 (the large subunit of
the subtype I-F system) given the overall similarity in the
operon organization between the I-E and I-F systems and
the clustering of these systems in the Cas1 phylogeny
[20]. Like Cse1, Csy1 also has an alpha-helical C-terminal
domain and an N-terminal region with mixed alphahelices and beta-strands (Additional File 5, Csy1 subfamily). Although the pattern of the predicted secondary
structure elements of Csy1 cannot be confidently aligned
with either Cse1 or Cas8, we cannot rule out the possibility that it contains a derived RRM-like fold. Most of the
large subunits of type I CRISPR-Cas systems containing
Zn-fingers also possess an N-terminal region with mixed
beta-strands and alpha helices which is compatible with
the general organization of the region following the HD
domain and preceding the Zn-finger in Cas10 subfamilies
(Region 2, Additional File 5). Taken together, analysis of
the general secondary structure features, the presence of
the Zn-finger domain in many large subunits, the similar
operon organization and the experimentally demonstrated functional link to RAMPs and the Cascade complex [8,13,15] raise the possibility that all large subunits
of CRISPR-Cas systems might be inactivated derivatives
of the CRISPR polymerase (Figure 4B). However, there is
currently not enough evidence to rule out non-homologous displacement of some of the large subunits or their
individual domains.
Interestingly, the pattern of secondary structure elements in the putative Fingers domain in Cas10 and several large subunits, Csx11, Cas8a2/Csa4, Csc3 (Region 2,
Additional File 5) resembles the structures of the RRM
domain found in RAMPs. Like the RRM core domain,
many of the Fingers-like domains contain four predicted
beta-strands. Furthermore, the Fingers-like domains
start with a beta strand-alpha helix element and ends by
a helix-beta-strand element, which are the two most
conserved structural patterns in RAMPs (see above and
Additional File 1). Thus, it is possible that the Fingers
domain of the large subunits adopts an RRM fold.
In several families of the large subunits (Cas8a1,
Cas8b, Cas8c, Cmx1 and Cas10d) of the I-A, B, C and

Makarova et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:38
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/38

D system subtypes, the C-terminal region (predicted
Thumb domain) is longer than that in Cas10 proteins
(8 alpha helices versus 4 in Cas10;Region 5, Additional
File 5). Interestingly, in these subtypes, the small Cascade subunit is missing in the CRISPR-Cas operons.
Typically, the small subunit is an alpha-helical protein
containing 6 alpha helices (structure is solved for cmr5:
AF1862, 2OEB and TTHB164, 2ZOP). This is, in principle, compatible with the size of the extra alpha helical
region at the C-termini of the aforementioned large subunits (Figure 4B). The Csy1 protein, the subtype I-F specific large subunit, contains eight predicted alpha helices
at the C-terminus and four helices at the extreme Nterminus. Because none of the predicted RAMP proteins
from this system contain extended alpha-helical regions
compatible with the size of the small subunit, we speculate that a domain homologous (or at least structurally
and functionally analogous) to the small subunit might
be “hidden” in Csy1.
The demonstration that at least some of the large subunits of Type I CRISPR-Cas systems are homologous to the
CRISPR polymerase suggests that all these large proteins
function and interact with DNA or RNA in a mode analogous to that of other Palm domain polymerases Table 1.
In particular, the Palm domain probably interacts with
ssDNA whereas the analog of the Thumb interacts with
dsDNA. Notably, evolutionarily conserved inactivated
derivatives of Palm domain polymerases have been
detected in Archaea and eukaryotes although their functions remain uncharacterized [35,36]. The small subunits
of CRISPR-Cas systems might be responsible for the
recognition of the PAM motif that is required for the
selection and incorporation of new spacers.
The conservation of the complete set of catalytic residues typical of Palm domain polymerases and cyclases
implies that the Palm domain of Cas10 is enzymatically
active but the nature of this activity remains unknown.
There is no indication that a processive polymerase is
involved at any stage of the CRISPR-Cas system functioning. The possibility remains that Cas10 is a nucleotidyltranferase or even a nucleotide cyclase, perhaps involved
in crRNA modification. This is compatible with the activity of the tRNA(His) guanylyltransferase THG1 [37] which
belongs to the same clade of Palm domain proteins with
Cas10 and the GGDEF diguanylate cyclases [31] (see
above). Another possibility is that Cas10 has a secondary
role as a helicase in one or more stages of CRISPR/Cas
functioning. A helicase activity dependent on the cleavage
of the a-b bond in NTP during polymerization has been
demonstrated for the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase [32,38,39], which is a derivative of the Palm domain
DNA polymerases [33]. Remarkably, all Type I CRISPRCas systems in which the large subunits are inactivated
Cas10 homologs also include the Cas3 helicase, and

Page 11 of 27

conversely, all Type III systems that contain Cas10 proteins predicted to be active lack Cas3 [20]. Thus, it is
tempting to propose that Cas3 compensates for the loss of
the original enzymatic function of Cas10 in Type I
CRISPR-Cas system whereas the inactivated derivative of
Cas10 performs an accessory structural role. It is of further
note that some Type U CRISPR-Cas systems that contain
degraded versions of Cas10 and lack Cas3 include a DinGlike helicase (see below), in further support of the possibility that a helicase activity required for the CRISPR-Cas
function can be supplied by different, in some cases, unrelated proteins.
Type II CRISPR-Cas systems and homologs of Cas9

The signature protein of the type II CRISPR-Cas systems
II, Cas9, does not show any detectable similarity to any
proteins in Type I and Type III systems. It appears that
Cas9 is sufficient both to generate crRNA and to cleave
the target DNA [6,9,20]. The large Cas9 protein (~1000
amino acids) contains two predicted nuclease domains,
namely, the N-terminal RuvC-like nuclease (RNAse H
fold) and the HNH (McrA-like) nuclease domain that is
located in the middle of the protein [5,40].
To analyze the remaining portions of the Cas9 protein, we constructed a multiple alignment of the two
distinct subfamilies of Cas9 (Csn1 and Csx12 subfamilies), predicted the secondary structure and performed
PSI-BLAST and HHpred searches with different queries
from these subfamilies. Both full-length proteins and
fragments outside of previously identified domains were
used for these searches (Additional File 6, N-terminal
region, N1 and C-terminal region N2). We failed to
detect any significant similarity for the region N1 which
is located between the two nuclease domains (Additional File 6) and is ~400 aa in length. The predicted
secondary structure in this region is mostly alpha-helical
with several beta-strands in the middle. For the region
N2 which is located downstream of the HNH domain
(eg. NMCC_0397 from Clostridium cellulolyticum H10,
610 to 1021 aa. Additional File 6), HHpred identifies a
weak similarity to the RuvC-like resolvase profile
(cd00529; probability 0.22). Given that a region similar
to RuvC has been previously detected at the N-terminus
of Cas9 [5], we investigated the N2 region in greater
detail. Comparative analysis of the conserved motifs and
secondary structure of Holliday junction resolvases
(HJRs) and endonucleases [40-42] and the regions of
similarity with RuvC identified in Cas9 indicates that
the N-terminal region contains three known motifs.
Furthermore, the region immediately after the HNHnuclease domain corresponds to the C-terminal region
of HJR superfamily which contains two alpha helices (or
one long helix) and a fourth motif with the signature
HxxD (Figure 5, motifs 1-4 in Additional File 6). Thus,
within the RuvC-like domain, Cas9 contains an almost

450 aa long insert which includes the HNH nuclease
domain; nevertheless, the RuvC domain is most likely
an active nuclease given the conservation of all four HJR
motifs and the characteristic conserved secondary structure elements (Additional File 6). For the rest of the N2
region, we failed to detect sequence similarity to any
proteins although secondary structure prediction for this
region shows that it consists mostly of beta-strands with
a few alpha helices, suggesting the presence of a compact globular domain (Additional File 6).
The exact roles of the two predicted nuclease domains
of Cas9 remain unclear. However, the insertion of the
HNH nuclease domain into the RNAse H fold domain
suggests that their activities are closely coupled and that
their active sites are proximally located. The HNH
nuclease domain, which is common in restriction
enzymes and possesses DNA-endonuclease activity
[43,44], might be responsible for the target cleavage.
Conversely, the RuvC-like RNAseH fold domain might
be involved in CRISPR transcript processing.
Several PSI-BLAST searches using various regions of
Cas9 as queries detected similarity to a large family of
prokaryotic proteins containing both RuvC-like and
HNH-nuclease domain (for the details on the identification of these homologs see Additional File 6). This family
could be divided into at least two subfamilies by domain
architecture (Figure 5). Analysis of the genomic context
of the genes encoding these Cas9 homologs did not
reveal any stable associations, and there are no CRISPR
repeats in the vicinity of any of these genes. Hence, the
function of these proteins remains obscure. An intriguing
possibility is that they might represent a novel system of

RNA-guided DNA interference involved in antivirus
defense that in some respects could be analogous to the
prokaryotic Argonaute proteins [45]. Some of these proteins form large species-specific paralogous families (e. g.
49 genes in Ktedonobacter racemifer or 17 genes in
Microcoleus chthonoplastes, see Additional File 6). These
expansions of closely related paralogs in the same genome suggest that at least this subset of the family could
represent novel mobile elements. The cas9 gene might
have been co-opted by the CRISPR/Cas system from
such mobile elements with the concomitant loss of typical CRISPR/Cas components, such as RAMPs and
CRISPR polymerases resulting in the emergence of the
distinctive Type II gene neighborhoods. The emergence
of Cas9 involved two distinct insertions, namely a mostly
alpha-helical insert near the middle of the protein
sequence and a mostly beta-stranded region near the Cterminus (Figure 5). These large inserts did not show
sequence similarity to any other proteins but, given the
close functional similarity between Type II and Type I/III
CRISPR-Cas, it cannot be ruled out that the inserts originate from CRISPR-Cas components.
Type U CRISPR-Cas systems

An unusual CRISPR-Cas system has been recently identified in several bacterial genomes, e.g., Acidithiobacillus
ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 (operon AFE_1037-AFE_1040)
(denoted type U as it did not contain signature genes of
any of the three CRISPR-Cas types) [20]. This system is
associated neither with the two ubiquitous core cas
genes, cas1 or cas2, nor with any other signature genes of
the three CRISPR-Cas types or the 10 subtypes. The A.
ferrooxidans system consists of four genes denoted csf1,

Makarova et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:38
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/38

csf2, csf3 and csf4. The Csf2 protein is a Cas7 group
RAMP closely related to the Csm3 subfamily. Csf3 is yet
another diverged RAMP protein that might be functionally analogous to the Cas5 group (Figure 3). Csf1 is a Znfinger containing protein. A PSI-BLAST search started
with one of the Csf1 proteins (AFE_1038, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans) after first iteration identified a weak
(not statistically significant) similarity with the Zn-finger
sequence of Cas10 proteins of the Crm2 family, and its
predicted secondary structure is comptabile with the treble clef fold. The secondary structure prediction for these
proteins generally shows the same pattern as in the large
Cascade subunits discussed above, namely several betastrands (some of them forming a potential hairpin) and
several alpha-helices at the C-terminus (Additional File
5). Taken together, these observations suggest the possibility that Csf1 could be a highly divergent, inactivated
and N-terminally truncated Cas10-like polymerase derivative lacking the N-terminal Fingers domain. The fourth
gene in this system, csf4, is usually located on the complementary DNA strand in the divergent orientation and
encodes a DinG family helicase [46]. According to the
CRISPRdb database [47], CRISPR arrays are present in
the vicinity of the above four genes in all of the respective
genomes but the architecture of these arrays is unique in
each case. Thus, this system might function in conjunction with different CRISPR arrays and would not require
a distinct repeat signature.
Homologs of Csf1, Csf2 and Csf3 were identified in
several Actinobacteria in a somewhat different genomic
context (eg. pREL1_0084-pREL1_0087 Rhodococcus erythropolis). There is no DinG-like helicase in the neighborhood. A gene encoding a small, largely alpha-helical
protein with conserved positively charged and aromatic
amino acids in several positions follows the csf1 gene.
This arrangement resembles the large and small Cascade
subunits of the I-E and III-A subtypes. All these loci are
located on plasmids. There are no CRISPR repeats
detected on these plasmids and, in many cases, in other
partitions of the respective genomes either (see the
CRISPRdb database [47]). Thus, this variant of the Type
U CRISPR-Cas system might be a mobile Cascade-like
module functioning in a completely different context,
not associated with CRISPR repeats and other Cas
proteins.
Unusual CRISPR-Cas system variants

A few CRISPR-Cas systems that could be readily classified into established subtypes or at least types based on
signature genes contain, in addition, unusual protein
families, domain fusions and/or operon rearrangements
(Figure 6). For example, a distinct subtype I-C system
variant has a number of specific features, in particular,
fused cas1 and cas4 genes and two extremely divergent

Page 13 of 27

RAMPs (Figure 6A). One of the latter is a homolog of
Cas7 group RAMPs (GSU0053), and the other one is an
apparent fusion of Cas5 and Cas6 group RAMPS
(GSU0054) (see Additional File 1). The ancestral version
of this systems could be similar to that present in Methanosarcina barkeri, with a probable homolog of Cas8
(inferred Cas8 family protein with characteristic alphahelical domain at C-terminus which could also include
fusion to the small subunit). Several CRISPR-Cas systems
(e.g. in Geobacter sulfurreducens) contain an apparent
deteriorated version of the Cas8 protein (which is identified on the basis of presence of alpha-helical C-terminal
domain and the location in the operon). In a few other
genomes there are no traces of a Cas8-like subunit (e.g.
in Bifidobacterium animalis). The additional gene in this
operon (Csb3 family) resembles RAMPs of the Cas6
family by secondary structure prediction and several
motifs (see additional file Additional file 1); however, this
protein also contains a C-terminal extension resembling
the alpha-helical region present in Cas8 family proteins.
The variant of the subtype I-F system in Photobacterium
profundum contains three genes that are clearly orthologous to Cas1, Cas2/Cas3 fusion and Cas6f of the I-F system, respectively; however, two additional genes in this
system encode proteins (PBPRB1993 and PBPRB1992)
that show no detectable sequence similarity to any
known protein families (Figure 6B). By length and the
position in the operon, these proteins resemble Csy2 and
Csy3, respectively. The predicted secondary structures of
these proteins are also compatible with the RAMP structure but not with that of the Cas8 family (no alpha-helical domain). Thus, these proteins might belong to the
Cas5 and Cas7 groups, respectively. The cas8 (large subunit) gene is absent in this system, which seems active
based on the presence of large array of CRISPR repeats
in the genome.
Some variants of the subtype III-B system encompass
the signature Csx10 family which belongs to the Cas5
group of RAMPs (Figure 6C). Another feature of this system is the presence of a protein of all1473 family, which
does not show any similarity to known Cas protein
families but the predicted secondary structure resembles
that of the RAMPs. These systems also contain the ribosomal protein S1 domain (the OB fold [48] which forms
two distinct fusions). In some systems (e.g. in Bacillus
tusciae), several additional fusions occurred, mostly
between adjacent genes in the operon (Figure 6C). The
Cas10 homolog in the latter systems lost the HD domain
but retained all catalytic residues of the Palm domain.
Comparative analysis of these unusual variants of
CRISPR-Cas system architectures may shed additional
light on CRISPR-Cas evolution as discussed in the next
section.

An evolutionary scenario for the origin of CRISPR-Cas
systems

Combined, the findings described here allow us to propose a simple scenario for the origin of the CRISPR-Cas
system (Figure 7). The primary observations that

contribute to this reconstruction of CRISPR-Cas evolution are:
i) the demonstration that Cas7 proteins represent a
distinct group of RAMPs

Figure 7 Evolutionary scenario for the origin of CRISPR-Cas systems. Homologous genes are color-coded and identified by a family name
(names follow the classification from [20]). Names in bold are proposed systematic names including those propose in this work; “legacy names”
are in regular font. The signature genes for CRISPR-Cas types are shown within green boxes, and for subtypes within red boxes. The bold letters
above the genes show major categories of Cas proteins: L, large CASCADE subunit; S, small CASCADE subunit; R, RAMP CASCADE subunit; RE,
RAMP family RNase involved in crRNA processing (experimentally characterized nucleases shown be asterisks); T, transcriptional regulator. Genes
coding for inactivated (putative) polymerases are indicated by crosses. Major evolutionary events are shown in the corresponding branches.
Broken lines denote alternative evolutionary scenarios for the origin of RAMPs.

ii) classification of all RAMPs into three major
groups, Cas5, Cas6 and Cas7
iii) the more tentative unification of Cas8 and Cas10
into the CRISPR polymerase family (large subunits
of CRISPR-Cas systems)
vi) the tentative unification of small, Csm2-like
subunits
Taking into account these newly discovered unifying
connections between the Cas proteins, comparison of

the gene composition and operon organization of the
three major types and 12 subtypes of CRISPR-Cas systems allows us to reconstruct the ancestral forms with
confidence.
The ancestral functional CRISPR-Cas system probably
resembled Subtype III-A and consisted of six or seven
genes, namely the two universal cas genes, cas1 and cas2
("information processing” subsystem involved in the
adaptation phase) along with four or five additional genes
which comprised the “executive” subsystem (CASCADE

Makarova et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:38
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/38

complex) involved in crRNA processing and interference.
The “executive” module included the large subunit
(Cas10/Cas8, or the CRISPR polymerase), the small subunit (an alpha-helical protein or domain enriched in positively charged and aromatic amino acids) and two or
three RAMPs (of the Cas5, Cas6 and Cas7 groups). Given
that Cas5 and Cas6 are structurally similar and considering that Cas5 probably substitutes for Cas6 in subtype IC, the ancestral system could have contained only one
protein representing these two families. Most of the
ancestral components are retained in many extant
CRISPR-Cas subtypes, in particular, the Type III systems
that show relatively little variation. In the most parsimonious scenario, relatively few evolutionary events are
required to explain the emergence of Type I and Type III
systems with their subtypes (Figure 7)
The key events that gave rise to Type I CRISPR-Cas
systems events include the acquisition of the helicase
Cas3 and the RecB family nuclease Cas4; inactivation of
the Palm domain of Cas10 protein that yielded Cas8; and
fission of HD domain and Cas10 followed by fusion of
HD domain with the Cas3-like helicase. The preservation
of 6-7 ancestral components in most of the Type I and
Type III CRISPR-Cas systems suggests tight structural
and functional links among these proteins. However, a
degree of independence between the “informational” and
“executive” modules has been reported previously
[5,19,20]. In particular, Type III “executive” modules
(type III Cascades) are often encoded separately (not in
proximity to cas1 and cas2 genes) and often occur in a
genome along with Type I and/or Type II systems.
Furthermore, Cas1 sequences from Type III systems are
not monophyletic in the phylogenetic tree [20], suggesting that Type III “executive” modules have combined
with diverse “informational modules” on multiple occasions. This is a likely evolutionary scenario for Subtype ID in which the Cascade complex (especially the Cas7
group RAMP Csc2) resembles the Type III counterpart
rather than other Type I Cascades (See Additional file 1).
Interestingly, HD domain in this subtype is associated
with the large subunit (Cas10d) rather than with Cas3,
again similarly to Type III rather than to other Type I
systems. However, the HD domain of Subtype I-D systems does not show the circular permutation that is characteristic of the HD domain fused with Cas10 in Type III
systems. Thus, in this case, the similarity of domain
architectures seems to be convergent, i.e., the HD
domain in Subtype I-D systems probably was translocated from cas3 to inactivated cas10 (or fused with the
latter if the ancestral form was a stand-alone HD
domain).
There are currently no archaeal or bacterial genomes
that would possess the “information processing” module
but not the “executive” module of the CRISPR-Cas

Page 16 of 27

system. Although involvement of Cas1 in various repair
processes has been suggested by recent experiments
[49], this tight linkage indicates that the primary function of Cas1-Cas2 depends on the Cascade complex (the
“executive module”). In contrast, “Cascade only” systems
(Type-U) that are not associated with CRISPR arrays
have been identified, suggesting the intriguing possibility
that some variants of Cascade might function as an
independent defense system, without relying on Cas1,
Cas2 and CRISPR arrays for the acquisition of spacers.
Although the source of RNA guides for such a system is
unclear, an interesting possibility is that this version of
Cascade might recognize alien DNA molecules and process nascent alien mRNA to generate RNA guides; such
mechanism obviously would be analogous to the siRNA
branch of the eukaryotic RNA interference systems [50].
From the evolutionary perspective, such standalone Cascades could be one of the antecedents of CRISPR-Cas
systems.
The ancestor of the CRISPR polymerase (Cas10) could
have originated from an ancient Palm domain polymerase, such as reverse transcriptase. On the basis of a
number of derived shared characters, the CRISPR polymerase has been classified as a member of a distinct
group of Palm domain proteins that also includes Thg1type 3’- 5’ nucleic acid polymerases and adenylate and
diguanylate cyclases [31]. The association with the HD
domain probably goes deep into the evolutionary past
given that HD family hydrolases are also commonly
associated with the GGDEF family diguanylate cyclases
[31,51]. The ancestral function of the CRISPR polymerase that was probably associated with the HD hydrolase
domain could potentially involve a distinct form of signal transduction, a role in repair and/or in antivirus
defense. The latter possibility seems attractive given the
tight association of this protein with the CRISPR-Cas
systems.
Genomic islands, in which viral defense, mobile elements and stress response genes, such as toxin-antitoxin
systems, are often present together, are likely to be “melting pots” for the emergence of new functional systems
through recombination, duplication and lateral transfer
[45,52]. It appears likely that the CRISPR-Cas systems
evolved in such genomic environments, in part by combination of distinct mobile elements. The origin of RAMPs
remains an enigma: these highly diverged RRM-domain
proteins possess shared derived characters that are
strongly suggestive of their monophyly (such as the presence of a glycine-rich loop and a conserved histidine
implicated in catalysis in numerous RAMPs) but do not
show significant similarity to any other proteins. An intriguing possibility is that there is a direct evolutionary connection between the CRISPR polymerase and the RAMPs
given that the cores of all these proteins consist of RRM

Makarova et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:38
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/38

domains. The first RAMP proteins could have emerged
by duplication of an inactivated polymerase followed by
rapid evolution that involved the emergence of the
endoribonuclease catalytic center. The ancestral RAMP
might have resembled Cas7 proteins that contain a single
RRM domain with structural embellishments along with
(in some of the Cas7 proteins) a Zn-finger domain, and
so resemble polymerases in their domain architecture.
Furthermore, several CRISPR-Cas systems apparently
remain functional despite having a highly degraded form
of the large subunit (type U system) or lacking the large
subunit altogether in some variants of Subtype I-C and
Subtype I-F (Figure 6B), suggesting that RAMPs could
substitute for the function of large subunits. The Cas6
and Cas5 group RAMPs could have subsequently evolved
from the Cas7-like RAMPs. This scenario seems plausible
considering that RAMP duplications, including tandem
duplications and fusions, are often present in CRISPRCas loci, especially among the Type III systems in which
Cas7 group RAMPs are particularly prone to duplication.
Interestingly, in both Type I Cascade complexes that
have been characterized in detail, those from E. coli and
S. solfataricus [8,16] the Cas7 subunit is present in multiple copies. It seems plausible that in Type III Cascades,
these homo-oligomers are replaced by hetero-oligomers
made of paralogous Cas7 proteins. Furthermore, recent
inactivation of the CRISPR polymerase (Cas10) was
detected in some Type III systems such as MTH326-like
(Figure 7). All these observations attest to the dynamic
character of the evolution of CRISPR-Cas systems and
might add to the plausibility of the route of evolution
from the CRISPR polymerase to the RAMP-based Cascade complexes (Figure 7). However, this scenario
remains speculative given the absence of specific similarity between the RAMPs and CRISPR polymerases, and
recruitment of another RRM-domain protein as the
ancestral RAMP gene cannot be ruled out.
The CRISPR polymerase and the entire ancestral, Subtype III-A-like CRISPR-Cas system most likely evolved
in thermophilic Archaea. Indeed, this system and in particular the cas10 gene is present in a substantial majority of archaea and is confidently reconstructed as a gene
present in Last Archaeal Common Ancestor (LACA)
[53]. By contrast, Type III CRISPR-Cas systems are
much less common in bacteria and often contain variants of Cas10 that are predicted to be inactivated [20].
Like most antiviral defense systems, CRISPR-Cas is
prone to HGT and could have rapidly spread among
bacteria. Notably, many thermophilic bacteria possess
Type III systems, which might have started the dissemination of CRISPR-Cas among bacteria. The active Cas10
could be particularly beneficial in thermal environments,
in agreement with the previous observations that

Page 17 of 27

identified Cas10 as a prominent genomic determinant of
the thermophilic life style [2,54].
The close association between Cas1 and Cas2 is more
difficult to explain in terms of function or evolution.
Given that Cas1 is a DNAse with a Holliday junction
resolvase-like activity [21,49], it is most likely to function as a recombinase and integrase at the spacer acquisition stage. These activities are typical of transposable
elements, so the origin of Cas1 from this type of elements that are extremely common in prokaryotes
appears likely. The endoribonuclease Cas2 might have
evolved from another class of equally widespread mobile
elements, namely toxin-antitoxin systems. Cas2 is yet
another RRM-domain protein that is homologous to
VapDHi, the toxin of the two-component toxin-antitoxin system vapDHi/VapX [55], as suggested previously
[5] and supported by new HHPred searches which
unequivocally retrieved Cas2 as the protein family most
similar to VapDHi (for example, a HHpred search
started with Psta_3906, VapDHi from Pirellula staleyi,
detected Cas2, PF09827, as the best hit with the probability 98.9). It remains unclear whether Cas1 and Cas2
ever formed a distinct two gene unit or have independently joined the evolving CRISPR-Cas system.
Type II CRISPR-Cas systems are the only group for
which the origin of Cascade complex components could
not be confidently inferred. Nevertheless, experimental
data suggests that it functions in general similarly to the
Cascade complexes of Type I and Type III systems [9].
Of the three types of CRISPR-Cas systems, the Type II
systems have undergone the most radical transformation
compared to the inferred ancestral form during which
the genes encoding the subunits of the ancestral Cascade complex as well as the large (polymerase) and
small subunits appear to have been replaced by a single
large, multidomain protein, Cas9 which contains two
unrelated nuclease domains (Figure 5) and appears to be
responsible for both the CRISPR transcript processing
and interference.

Conclusions
The CRISPR-Cas systems are extremely variable in their
gene composition, and most of the cas genes evolve fast
compared to other genes in prokaryotes. Accordingly, the
comparative analyses of the Cas protein sequences and
structures present a history of progressive detection of
increasingly subtle relationship leading to unification of
protein families previously thought to be unrelated
([2,5,19,20]. and see Figure 4). The observations described
here take this unification a step further. In particular, we
substantially expanded the class of RAMPs and showed
that at a high level the Cas proteins can be classified into
no more than a dozen major groups of families including

Makarova et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:38
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/38

the Cas1-Cas10 proteins, another group of small subunits
(Cas11?) and additionally a few regulatory protein families
such as csm6. The majority of the families that have been
left with historical “legacy” names in the recently published CRISPR-Cas classification scheme [20] now can be
assigned to well-defined, “numbered” groups of cas genes
(see Additional File 7). The results of this analysis emphasize that the CRISPR-Cas systems are built around RRM
domains that reach extreme diversification in the RAMPs.
This diversity along with recombination between different
CRISPR-Cas loci makes more detailed classification and
functional prediction for the CRISPR-Cas systems in the
rapidly growing collection of archaeal and bacterial genomes a difficult challenge.
The unification of numerous Cas proteins into the
three major groups of RAMPs and the more tentative
demonstration of the probable origin of large subunits
of diverse CRISPR-Cas systems from CRISPR polymerases together suggest a simple scenario for the origin and evolution of the CRISPR-Cas machinery in
thermophilic archaea. Under this scenario, the CRISPRCas systems started from a large protein that combined
the polymerase and HD hydrolase domain and might
have functioned as a stand-alone antivirus defense system. The next step of evolution might have involved
duplication of the RRM portion of the polymerase followed by inactivation that produced the ancestral, Cas7like RAMP or a recruitment of a distinct RRM-domain
protein that became the ancestral RAMP. Regardless of
the origin of the ancestral RAMP genes, it has undergone a series of additional duplications and rapid diversification that yielded the stand-alone Cascade complex.
The formation of the ancestral CRISPR-Cas system was
then completed through the unification of Cascade with
Cas1 and Cas2. The central theme of this scenario is the
origin of the components of the CRISPR-Cas system
from different classes of mobile elements. Other prokaryotic defense systems such as restriction-modification
[56,57] and toxin-antitoxin systems [58,59] also comprise of such elements, indicating a major trend in the
relationships between prokaryotes, viruses that infect
them, other classes of selfish element and defense
mechanisms.

Methods
The cas gene nomenclature follows the recently published CRISPR-Cas classification [20]. Protein sequence
searches were performed using PSI-BLAST [60] with an
inclusion threshold E-value of 0.01 and no compositionbased statistical correction The NR (non-redundant)
database (the default for PSI-BLAST searches at NCBI)
was used for all searches unless indicated otherwise. In
addition, distant similarity detection approaches were

Page 18 of 27

applied, namely RPS-BLAST with default parameters to
search the conserved domain database (CDD) search
[61] and the HHpred search that is based on the comparison of protein family profiles using the Hidden Markov Model technique [27,62]. For the HHpred searches,
single sequences were used as a queries, and the SCOP,
PDB, PFAM, CDD, TIGRFAM and COG databases were
searched as represented on the HHpred server, the
default program parameters. Following the recommendations of the HHpred authors, we used the reported
probability of a true positive match rather than the evalue to assess the statistical significance of a hit [27].
Multiple alignments of protein sequences were constructed by using the MUSCLE program [63], followed
by a minimal manual correction on the basis of local
alignments obtained using PSI-BLAST [60] and HHpred
[62]. Protein secondary structure was predicted using
the Jpred program [64] and these results were used to
improve alignment between families within superfamily.
Structural comparisons were performed using the DALI
server [65].

Main comments

The CRISPR system has a fundamental complexity, probably due to rapid evolution and lateral gene transfer, that
can be bewildering to those not deeply steeped in the
field. Recent crystal structures (notably Cas6 and Cas7)
have clarified the relationships of CAS proteins somewhat, and the authors here aim to augment this with
extensive bioinformatic analyses to begin a unification
(and hopefully simplification) of the plethora of CAS proteins that present a significant barrier to understanding.
Finally, one possible evolutionary scenario is outlined.
This is an interesting and provocative paper. Many predictions are made, some on shakier grounds than others.
The manuscript synthesises a vast amount of bioinformatic analysis and will be a valuable resource for anyone
interested in the CRISPR system - whether or not they
agree with many of the predictions made in it.
Specific comments

1) Firstly, I wonder if the term “RAMP” has lost utility and should be cast on to the bonfire of nomenclature? We now know that RAMP proteins are
essentially CAS proteins with an RRM fold - is there
any need for another term? They are not even particularly mysterious any more. On the other hand, the
RRM fold puts Cas proteins firmly in a functional
category.

Makarova et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:38
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/38

Response: In our view, there is still utility in the name
RAMP. It was introduced by us back in 2002 (ref. 2) and
originally meant “Repair associated mysterious proteins”.
Later Haft at al. creatively renamed them “Repeat associated mysterious proteins” [19] when it became clear
that these proteins are part of the CRISPR-Cas system. It
makes sense to have a special name or acronym for these
RRM-containing proteins because they appear to constitute a monophyletic superfamily. There are occasions
when putative RAMPs seem not to be associated with a
CRISPR-Cas system - at least they do not belong to cas
operons, for example, COG1851 described in ref. 5. Thus,
replacing RAMP with something like CARRM (CRISPRassociated RRMs) might be inaccurate or at least premature. It is true that ‘mysterious’ in RAMP might not be
particularly relevant anymore (a few mysteries remain
but probably will be resolved soon) but we believe that
for the time being this historically rooted acronym is better kept.
2) The statement that the Pyrococcus CRISPR-Cas
system targets RNA (Page 5 line 84) is misleading.
Pyrococcus almost certainly has a CASCADE-like
DNA targeting system too. Please clarify the text.
Response: Yes, we agree and have clarified the respective part of the text.
3) Following on from my first suggestion, to my
mind it would be clearer to say that Cas7 shares an
RRM domain with many other CAS proteins, rather
than classify it as a RAMP (line 130). After all, RNA
recognition is probably what many, or all, of the
RAMP proteins are actually doing.
Response: On this point, we do not agree. As indicated
above, the RAMPs form a well defined superfamily, and
Cas7 is a family within this superfamily (as we show in
Figure 1). Moreover, the part of the manuscript concerning RAMP classification explains in detail the reasons
behind combining several subfamilies into the Cas7
family within the RAMP superfamily. It is indeed very
likely that the general function of RAMPs is RNA recognition and binding as first proposed in our 2006 paper
[5]. However, this general functional description does
cover the subject because there certainly is functional
specialization among the RAMPs - for instance, some
families are catalytically active whereas others are not.
4) The sentence “Structural comparisons seem to
suggest an affinity between the Cas6 and Cas7
groups” (line 218) is correct - they share an RRM
domain as stated earlier in this paper. Need this be
repeated?

Page 19 of 27

Response: This is not only about the shared RRM
domain but rather about the possible specific affinity
between Cas6 and Cas7 as we clarify in the revised text.
So this is not a pointless repetition of a previously made
statement, and has to stay in a form modified for clarity
and emphasis.
5) The paragraph beginning line 226 notes that cas5
and cas7 genes are usually adjacent. It would be
appropriate here to report that the proteins are
known to form the core of the Type1 CASCADE
complexes both in E. coli (several REFS) and S. solfataricus (REF 16).
Response: Yes, we agree; a sentence to that effect and
references are added:” Remarkably, the Cas5 and Cas7
orthologs in two distinct CRSIPR-Cas systems belong to
a stable core of the CASCADE complex both in E.coli
(Type I-E) [7,8] and in S. solfataricus (Type I-A) [16].”
6) The paragraph beginning line 238 deals with a
presumed conserved catalytic histidine identified in
Cas6 and also claimed to be present in many representatives of Cas5 and Cas7. I take strong issue with
this claim. The histidine is in fact very poorly conserved, even within the Cas6 nucleases - I challenge
the authors to identify a candidate in the equivalent
position in crenarchaeal Cas6’s for example. Likewise, I see no conserved histidine in the Cmr4 and
Cmr6 proteins that I am most familiar with. Indeed
it would be unusual if a catalytic residue was
observed in these examples, as they are almost certainly not catalytic subunits (eg E. coli CASCADE
has no nucleolytic activity). I think this needs revision, along with the accompanying figure where the
blue line represents the “conserved” active site.
Response: It is true that presumed catalytic histidine is
not 100% conserved even in the proteins of the Cas6
group, and representatives of the Cmr4, Cmr6 and Cas5
families indeed exist that lack this histidine. However,
we presented alignments of all RAMP families (for these
alignments, we tried to select the most diverse representatives for each family) discussed in this work in Additional File 1 to back all our claims. The general
conservation of the histidine in Cmr4 is strong (100% for
our set of 30 selected diverse sequences), and the same
holds for the Csm4 and Csb3 families; in other families
(e.g. Cmr6) the conservation is less pronounced but still
traceable in at least 50% of the sequences (see the consensus shown in the Additional File 1). Given that these
histidines are located after the first beta-strand of the
(first) RRM domain, they are most likely to be homologous. Neither Cas7 nor Cas5 families contain this

Makarova et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:38
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/38

particular partially conserved histidine, which is consistent with the absence of nucleolytic activity of CASCADE
in E.coli. However, as we pointed out in the text, in the
type I-C systems, the Cas5 family probably substitutes
for the Cas6 function using a potential catalytic histidine
in a different location. Certainly, for some of the families
that contain the partially conserved histidine, the catalytic activity is only a prediction. We cannot rule out that
in some families this histidine performs a structural role,
and that these proteins are not active nucleases. Conversely, we cannot confidently claim that the families that
lack the conserved histidine are not active nucleases: in
the case of different Cas6 subfamilies, we already know
that different amino acids can contribute to the catalytic
activity. Taking into account all these and additional
considerations in the text, considerations, we believe that
it is appropriate to keep the original version of Figure 3,
especially given that the main purpose of this Figure is to
show a hypothetical scenario of RAMP evolution. However, to clarify the hypothetical character of our predictions of nuclease activity in RAMPs other than the Cas6
group, we added words of caution throughout the respective parts of the text and the legend to Figure 3.
7) From line 319 onwards, the authors refer to a
“zinc finger” domain in Cas10. A zinc finger is a
very narrowly defined subset of the much larger
group of zinc binding domains. Is this really a zinc
finger? If not then a global replace with “zinc binding domain” would be appropriate.
Response: Zn-finger is appropriate here. Zn-fingers
actually represent a structurally diverse class of domains
that chelate one or more Zn ions (e.g. various Treble Clef
domains, C2H2-like, WRKY and BED domains that have
ostensibly different folds).
The speculation that Cse1 and Cas10 are homologous,
in the absence of any bioinformatic evidence other than
that they are “a similar size” seems unwarranted, particularly as the two proteins seem to have very different
properties based on the available biochemical data.
Response: We are not aware of biochemical data
showing that these proteins possess very different properties. The only piece of evidence known to us is that these
proteins are subunits of the CASCADE-like complexes
(CASCADEs in E. coli [13] and Pseudomonas [66], and
the Cmr complex in Pyrococcus [15]). This information
seems to be compatible with the speculation that these
proteins are highly diverged homologs although we certainly admit and indicate in the article that the indications are weak.
The authors return to this theme (line 352) and here
provide some data based on secondary structure

Page 20 of 27

prediction. These paragraphs could be merged. However, the data linking Cas10 with Cse1 and Cas8 is
really very weak and there is a good chance that
they are not related. When a possible evolutionary
relationship between two proteins seems to depend
on the prediction of shared “mixed beta-strands and
alpha helices” (line 373), it is hanging by a very thin
thread indeed. To be fair, this is explicitly acknowledged later (line 380), but then the authors go on to
assert that “at least some of the large subunits of
Type 1 systems are homologous to the CRISPR polymerase”, and then suggest commonalities in RNA
and DNA binding. For me, the relationship is not at
all proven from the available biochemical and bioinformatic evidence.
Response: The homologous relationship between Cas10
and large subunits of type I systems is indeed a hypothesis (one may choose to use ‘speculation’ instead); hopefully, the structures of these proteins will be solved soon
enough - this should settle the issue. However, combining
all the available data and all the indirect bioinformatic
evidence, we would rather submit that there is a low
chance that they are not homologous. Here we summarize all the lines of evidence once again:
1. Both Cas10 and the Type I large subunits (LS) are
parts of CRISPR-Cas systems
2. They are encoded in very similar contexts in the
respective operons (see the Figure 1A and 7)
3. These proteins are similar in size (Cas10 is compared without HD domain; see Figures 1A and 1B)
4. Cas10 and LS form CASCADE-like complexes with
RAMPs
5. Many LS contain Zn fingers in the middle of the
protein - similarly to Cas10
6. Secondary structure analysis suggests the same
general architectures of Cas10 and LS, which is also
similar to the general organization of Palm domaincontaining polymerases.
7. Secondary structure of the region following the Znfingers (where present) for most LS is compatible with
the RRM fold
For typical predictions based on the ‘guilt by association’ approach, the first four points would be sufficient to
predict the analogous functions for these subunits (such
a functional link between LS and Cas10 has been suggested in our 2006 paper [5]). Homology of these proteins
appears to be the most parsimonious (the simplest)
explanation for these observations. The last three points
reinforce this hypothesis stronger by decreasing the likelihood that all these common features evolved independently. There are also numerous additional issues such

Makarova et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:38
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/38

as the inactivation of the predicted catalytic aspartates
in the Palm domains and the lack of the HD domain in
some Cas10 proteins, the dramatic divergence in the
adjacent genes in the respective operons, and indications
of domain loss and deterioration of the LS leading to the
rapid loss of sequence similarity that could be brought
into the discussion. More generally, we should note that
rapid divergence of many components of the CRISPR-Cas
systems including most of the RAMPs certainly is their
salient and important feature. The biological connotations of this rapid evolution remain to be characterized.
All of this notwithstanding, in the text of the paper, we
point out that non-orthologous displacement of some of
the LS is a distinct possibility. We believe that in this
discussion, taken together with the reviewer’s points, all
relevant issues are covered.
9) The function of the “polymerase” domain of Cas10 is
certainly open to question. The suggestion that this
domain may function as a helicase and might even act as a
functional equivalent of Cas3 (paragraph beginning line
412) is ingenious although I suspect incorrect. It e would
be interesting to ascertain whether the activity of the Pyrococcus CMR complex requires ATP hydrolysis in vitro this is not really addressed in the paper published in 2009.
Response: We indeed have little hard data to make
any strong prediction on the function of Cas10. Back in
2002, we believed that it was a polymerase and presented several considerations in support of this hypothesis
that now seems unlikely to be true considering all we
know about the CRISPR-Cas systems. Thus, we seem to
be essentially left with a cyclase activity but this is again
hard to reconcile with the available experimental data.
The speculation that Cas10 is a functional equivalent of
Cas3 is at least consistent with the observation that the
(predicted) active Cas10 is present mostly in the
CRISPR-Cas systems lacking Cas3.
10) Finally, the scheme in Figure 6 outlining a possible
scenario for the evolution of the CRISPR/Cas system is
by its nature speculative of course. On the one hand,
the identification of the RRM domain as a ubiquitous
component of CRISPR is very welcome and the subdivision of this classification into Cas5, Cas6 and Cas7 is
interesting. I would perhaps include Cas10 as the fourth
type of RRM containing protein. As I have stated above,
I am not convinced that the “large subunits” - Cas10,
Cse1, Cas8 etc, are all homologous, though I concede
that they may turn out to be - structures will be
required. It is not clear to me why evolution of the system should have started with Cas10 - seems equally
likely that this is a quite specialized derivative of the system and that a progenitor might have had a ramp protein plus an HD domain as a simple viral defense unit
Response: As repeatedly pointed out in this article and
in previous publications, regardless of its specific function,

Page 21 of 27

Cas10 is clearly homologous to Palm domain polymerase,
and its secondary structure is compatible with the overall
structure of those polymerases (Fingers, Palm and Thumb
domains). Beyond doubt, the Palm domain polymerases
comprise an ancient protein family antedating modern
cellular life. Therefore it seems highly plausible that the
evolution of the CRISPR-Cas system per se started from
the polymerase-like protein. Furthermore, fusion of polymerases (the HD domain in the case of CRISPR-Cas) with
nucleases is a pervasive theme in the evolution of replication and repair systems [2,67]. Thus, the polymerase and
the polymerase-nuclease fusion chart a plausible path of
evolution from the general replication machinery to the
CRISPR-Cas system. In a sharp contrast with Palm
domain polymerases, the RAMPs are highly specialized
and more or less restricted to CRISPR-Cas systems which
makes them unlikely ancestors. We certainly do not deny
that the evolutionary scenario presented is speculative but
we believe there is a strong logical underpinning behind it.
Minor points

Table 1. The prediction of DNA nuclease activity for
Cas10 seems to discount the available biochemical evidence for the role of Cmr2.
Response: We are not sure what the relevant data is.
The prediction of nuclease activity for the HD domain is
confident.
Line 104 - “and” missing
Response: we checked and double checked this line
and the lines around it but could not identify a place to
insert “and”.
Line 120 - “functioning” should be replaced by
“function”
Response: Replaced.
Reviewer’s report 2

Dr. Frank Eisenhaber, Bioinformatics Institute (BII),
Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A
*STAR), Singapore
This work describes an exhaustive sequence analysis
of the protein components of the CRISPR-Cas modules
in the framework of the sequence homology concept.
The strength of this article is the finally derived, highly
plausible evolutionary scenario of the protein modules
that is of striking simplicity. This is a very strong biological argument supporting the conclusion chain of this
work.
The latter helps to moderate the awkward impression
from sometimes very lousy significances of alignments
that would not be worth being mentioned outside of
this context (the worst case being 0.42 for the match of
the profiles of Cas8a2 and Cas8a1, msp 15).
Response: Obviously, we would never propose that these
families are homologous on the basis of “lousy” HHpred
probability value. The hypothesis makes sense only

Makarova et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:38
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/38

within the context of the entire analysis and considerations presented in this paper which include genomic context, domain composition and secondary structure
compatibility evidence. The reviewer concurs that collectively this amounts to evidence worth consideration.
It is not good to present such data as strong findings;
some self-critical, moderating comments with regard to
such cases would enhance the article.
Response: We have never claimed that these were
strong findings. There were quite a few moderating comments even in the original manuscript although we are
not sure in what sense such comments are supposed to
be self-critical as long as nothing is misrepresented. The
revision includes additional words of caution as well as
further explanations, in particular, in the responses to
Reviewer 1.
Minor points

1) Reference style in Figure 4 does not fit the style of
the reference list. Please add the reference number.
Corrected.
2) Msp 5 (line 91) has an obvious typo (“revealed =
distant”).
Corrected.
Reviewer’s report 3

Dr. Igor B. Zhulin, Department of Microbiology,
University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN
As the protein sequence space grows, it becomes
increasingly important to continuously improve and
update natural classification of protein families. Makarova et al provide a unified classification for CRISP-associated (Cas) proteins and a scenario for the origins of
CRISP-Cas. This work was carried out by employing a
classical computational genomics approach based on
analysis of protein sequences and structures. The subject
of this paper is outside my immediate expertise and
therefore I will not comment on its potential significance and impact for this field of CRISP-Cas systems
and antiviral immunity in prokaryotes. Authors should
rely on other reviewers in this regard. In my opinion,
authors have provided essential background information
about the systems and it was easy to follow the logic of
their story. From the technical point of view, this is a
well-executed study, which is not surprising considering
authors’ expertise and their standing in the field. However, the overall presentation is not as CRISP as the title
might suggest. Papers presenting original research must
provide enough detail, so results can be independently
verified and reproduced, which is not the case here.
This is primarily due to two issues that I have outlined
below as major concerns.
Response: We are perplexed by the blanket criticism of
our work and strongly disagree. Some additional details
are provided in response to the specific comments below,

Page 22 of 27

and a few unfortunate mistakes in the references to
Additional Files are corrected. Overall, however, we
maintain that the manuscript as submitted conformed to
the presentation standards in the field of computational
molecular biology. Furthermore, we see an internal contradiction in the reviewer’s comment: it is either “a wellexecuted study, which is not surprising considering
authors’ expertise and their standing in the field” or
“Papers presenting original research must provide enough
detail, so results can be independently verified and
reproduced, which is not the case here”. It cannot be
both ways.
MAJOR CONCERNS

1. Data and procedures are not described adequately. I
will illustrate this point by a few examples taken from
the very first section of Results & Discussion (pages 7
and 8): a. Authors state (lines 127-128): “... we performed exhaustive sequence database searches [IZ:
which database? See also comment 2b] for all Cas protein families using the HHpred profile against profile
search method”. Does it mean “using sequences of
representative members of these families?” As far as I
understood, HHpred input requires a sequence, not a
protein family, or a multiple sequence alignment.
Therefore, authors should provide a list of all
sequences that were used as queries in these HHpred
searches, explaining why they were chosen (e.g. experimentally confirmed function, structure available, was
previously predicted to be a Cas protein, etc) and providing corresponding references. They also should present the search result for each sequence, including the
E-value and reported probability to be a false positive,
similarly to the example shown on lines 130-134. A
simple table in Excel would be a great choice to show
these input data and search results. As it stands, I can
only see input data and results for two sequences:
ST0029 (line 130) and its reciprocal hit (line 133).
Response: The list of databases we used to search
against using HHpred is provided in the Methods section.
For “exhaustive” sequence database searches we usually
run PSI-BLAST (and HHpred) with several diverged
representatives within the family to ensure maximum
coverage. It does not make any sense to report all these
results because we present an alignment and use the
results of multiple searches to manually correct it. This
is not a fully automated process, and it will not be
reproducible as soon as the databases change, and they
change continuously.
For alignments we select representatives manually,
again trying to cover the maximum diversity within the
family both in terms sequence diversity and taxonomy,
but do not include fragments or sequences which are disrupted in some way and/or contain long insertions or

Makarova et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:38
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/38

deletions because our aim here is to showcase the typical
representatives of a family. We believe that all the alignments we provide give an adequate family representation
to back all the claims made in the text.
We find the demands for greater level of detail (e.g.,
“They also should present the search result for each
sequence”) unreasonable and out of line with the de
facto standards.
b. Authors state (lines 134-137): “We used the alignments obtained during these and other searches started
from other query sequences along with secondary structure prediction to construct multiple alignments for
Cas7 and a number of most closely related RAMP subfamilies (Figure 1)”. What other searches? What other
query sequences? Neither the follow-up text nor the figure legend for Figure 1 provides answers to these questions. Why these and not other sequences are shown on
Figure 1? For example, Figure 4A shows at least two
Cas7 genes in Staphylococcus epidermidis, but no
sequences from this organism can be found on Figure 1.
So, my guess is that Figure 1 shows representative
sequences, but again this is just my guess. If it is so,
why these sequences were selected as representative
(e.g. to illustrate diversity or only highly scoring
sequences are shown)? I cannot find any explanation
anywhere in this paper. I was able to find one sequence
from Staphylococcus epidermidis in Additional File 1
(which presumably contains the most comprehensive
data). In accordance with Figure 4A, this sequence is
shown under Cas7 group. I have figured out this is the
protein encoded by the second Cas7 gene from the cluster shown in Figure 4A (labeled as Csm5); however,
there is no sequence for the protein encoded by the first
Cas7 gene (Csm3) in the Additional File 1. Is this an
error on Figure 4A or incomplete data representation in
Additional File 1?
Response: See the response to the previous comment. We
have added the Csm3 protein from Staphylococcus epidermidis in the Additional File 1 but not to Figure 1 because
Csm3 from Staphylococcus epidermidis is quite similar to
the ortholog from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Expect =
1e-37 Identities = 93/226 (41%), Positives = 132/226
(58%)) which is present in the Figure 1 and we can show
only a limited number of sequences in the figure.
c. Authors state (lines 149-150): “Examination of this
structure unequivocally demonstrates the presence of a
single RAMP domain...[16]“. Even if we ignore the wording (although I maintain a view that examination cannot
demonstrate anything), it is unclear who came up with
this conclusion: authors of the current paper or those
who published the structure, without reading the structure paper. The continuation of this description (lines
150-152) is also confusing: “...a single RAMP domain that
contains four inserts within the RRM core and a C-

Page 23 of 27

terminal extension. None of these additional domains of
Cas7 show sequence or structural similarity to any
known domains [16]“. Is this a direct quote from reference 16? What is meant by “these additional domains"?
Are the four inserts within a domain core and a C-terminal extension referred to as domains? Why, if they show
no sequence or structural similarity to any known
domains???
Response: for the sake of style ‘unequivocally’ has been
replaced with ’clearly’. That apart, however, we find the
text in question to be unequivocal. The ‘examination’
that, in our firm opinion, is quite capable of demonstrating things comes from Ref. 16 but we concur with their
conclusions. This is perfectly clear from the text. The
‘additional domains’ are inserts, and this is clear as well.
d. Authors state (lines 156-158): “We performed...
HHpred searches using representatives of 19 RAMP
families... (Additional File 1). What are these 19
families? I couldn’t find any reference to them in the
Background or in the Additional File 1, which contains
over 30 individual MSAs and some of them are labeled
as “family” (e.g. Cas6 family, the very last one), some are
labeled as “subfamily” (e.g. Cas5 BF2549 subfamily),
some are labeled as “group” (e.g. MTH323/Csm4 (Cas5
group)), and majority do not have labels that would
identify them as a family (they have names, but are
those family names?). Let us treat the first three lines of
the Additional File 1 as its title (Please see TECHNICAL
COMMENTS below regarding this file). It reads: “Cas7
group (COG1857 and other Cas7, COG1337/Csm3;
COG1604/cmr6; COG1336/Cmr4; Csc2; Csf2; Csy3;
Csm5 (COG1332), Cmr1 (COG1367, double Cas7). Let
us assume that families are separated by comas and
semicolons. Then there are 9 families in this group. Following the same assumption, there are 4 families in
each of the Cas5 and Cas6 groups. I still cannot figure
out what are the 19 families then. Perhaps, the first
three lines of this file are not the title after all. This suspicion is confirmed by the main text (line 163), which
lists 5 RAMPs in the Cas5 group (the 5th is Csy2, which
is missing from the Cas5 description on the top of
Additional File 1). The bottom line is that there is no
place in the paper, where 19 families are clearly
specified.
Response: Unfortunately, in lines 156-158 of the original manuscript, we have mistakenly referred to a wrong
Additional File. The correct reference is to Additional
File 3 (all the 19 families in question are listed in Additional File 3 and their names correspond to the families
with the same names in Additional File 1). Additional
File 1 also contains some other alignments most of which
are relevant to the discussion of different RAMP families
and CRISPR-Cas systems throughout the text. We believe
that these alignments will be useful to researchers

Makarova et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:38
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/38

studying individual CRISPR-Cas systems because they
cover all the RAMP diversity we aware of. The family
names are given according to Makarova et al. [20] alternative family identifiers are given in parentheses. We
modified the description of the families for the sake of
greater consistency. Some explanations were added to the
Additional File 1 header. The GI IDs of sequences that
were used for the corresponding HHpred searches are
now available in Additional File 3.
e. Returning to the main text (line 158): “... and collected similarity scores between corresponding profiles
(Additional File 1)”. I cannot see any similarity scores or
any profiles in this file or anywhere else. I have stopped
evaluating the adequacy of presentation after page 8,
because it will require too much time, but I hope that
authors will continue the trend I have initiated here and
critically reevaluate their data presentation.
Response: Unfortunately, it was a wrong reference to
Additional File. Corrected.
2. Methods are described at the very minimum. This
section (half a page) looks like a methods summary,
not methods description.
Response: Given that the methods used in this study
are all published, the Methods section is generally adequate. A few details were added in response to the comments below. No one would gain anything from lengthy
descriptions.
a. For PSI-BLAST, two search parameters were specified (page 34, line738), whereas no other details provided for any other type of analysis. If all parameters
were default, it should be specifically stated.
Response: It is now stated in the Methods section.
b. There is a lack of consistency (and detail) in
describing database search tools and databases. In one
case, a search tool is specified (PSI-BLAST), but the
database(s) is not (page 34, line737); whereas in the
other case a database is specified (CDD), but the search
tool (RPS-BLAST) and its parameters are not (page 34,
line 740). No database is specified for HHpred searches
(page 34, line 741).
Response: It is now stated in the Methods section.
c. Authors state (lanes 741-743): “Following the
recommendations of the HHpred authors, we used the
reported probability of a true positive match rather than
the e-value to assess the statistical significance of a hit
[27]“. After reading the reference 27, I didn’t get a sense
that probability of a true positive match should be used
instead of the E-value. Soding indeed writes that “Evalues reported by most tools, including ours, can be
very unreliable”, but my take is that he suggests using
the probability of a true positive match in addition to
and not instead of the E-value.

Page 24 of 27

Response: We read this statement of Söding as an
indication of the superiority of the true positive match
probabilities over the e-values because, unlike the theoretically computed e-values, these probabilities come from
the analysis of a benchmarked set.
In any case, at least one of these parameters must be
provided for all search results (see comment 1a).
Response: On this occasion, the purpose of the analysis
is not to reinforce the relatedness of the RAMPs (which
has been demonstrated previously with a variety of
methods) but rather to provide a metric for comparison
of different RAMP families. The only part of the HHpred
output that is suitable for this purpose is the actual
score, and accordingly, Additional File 3 includes the
score values. Probability values are quoted in the text
where appropriate.
TECHNICAL COMMENTS

3. Additional File 1
a. What is shown in the Additional File 1? There is no
title (I understand that the first 3 lines sort of serve the
purpose of the title, but it is certainly not the title and
they contain errors - see comment 1d) and no footnote
explaining it.
Response: The title of the file was provided in the list
of all additional files included to the paper. The header
for Additional File 1 is included in the revision. Explanations for the content of the file are also included.
b. Were these alignments automatically generated? It
looks like a raw output file from some program or server. Reference to this file on page 8 (lines 156-159) is
confusing: authors state that this is as a result of both
DALI and HHpred searches. How so? Were DALI outputs used as inputs for HHPred? Full explanation of
what is shown in this file is needed.
Response: The alignments were constructed as
described in the Methods section. HHpred alignments
are not included. HHpred probability values are reported
in Additional file 3. Other explanations relevant to this
concern are provided above.
c. For some alignments, both 2D prediction and consensus are shown (e.g. Csy3), whereas for others only 2D
prediction (e.g. Csb1, Cmr6) is shown. Is there any reason for that? No explanation is given to the fact that for
some groups both 90% and 100% consensus are shown
(e.g. Cmr4), whereas for others - only 85% consensus
(e.g. Cas7 ygcJ). In some cases, results of 2D prediction
and consensus are shown underneath the alignment (e.g.
Csy3), whereas in other cases consensus is shown above
and 2D underneath (e.g Cas7 (ygcJ). Amazingly, in some
cases, 2D prediction is shown in the middle of the family
alignment (e.g. Csb1). Is this all due to scripting errors? If
so, how do we know whether in this case the upper part
of the alignment is not in fact the bottom part of the
alignment of another family shown above? This could

Makarova et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:38
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/38

have been a scripting error resulting in inserting a family
id and some spacing in the middle of a family alignment...
This inattention to the detail increases the probability of
accidental errors and raises concerns.
Response: In the revision, we show the 2D structure
consistently underneath each alignment. The information
on the program used to generate the consensus is provided in the header of Additional File 1 (the % of consensus was chosen ad hoc depending on the conservation
with a family). Several additional consensus lines (for
the families with a potential catalytic residues conserved)
were included.

Reviewer’s response
I regret that authors have interpreted my comments as
“the blanket criticism of their work”. Nowhere in my
review have I questioned analyses, conclusions or the
validity of their work.
My frustration with the lack of some key results (that
apparently were present, but not in the file, which was
referenced in the text) on the background of haziness in
describing data collection and incompleteness in describing key methodologies, led me to strong wording regarding the reproducibility of results. In light of corrections
and revisions made, I no longer maintain this view.
Although authors insisted that “the manuscript as submitted conformed to the presentation standards in the
field of computational molecular biology”, I am pleased
to see that most of my requests for more detail and
more attention to detail were accommodated in revision.
I believe that standards in such a new and rapidly
evolving discipline as computational molecular biology
should also evolve to reflect the unprecedented data
growth. In reply to my requests for more transparency
in describing results of database searches, authors wrote
that “results will not be reproducible as soon as the
database change, and they change continuously”. I argue
that exactly because the database content changes continuously, we must ensure results are reproducible. I
understand that demanding each and every search detail
will make research inefficient; however, there are relatively simple steps to ensure reproducibility of searches:
working with (and specifying) a fixed dataset/database of
known date/version, providing thresholds for searches
and other settings for programs, and showing as many
results of these searches as possible.
