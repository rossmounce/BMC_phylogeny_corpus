Abstract
Background: Glutamate gated postsynaptic receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) are
essential for environmentally stimulated behaviours including learning and memory in both
invertebrates and vertebrates. Though their genetics, biochemistry, physiology, and role in
behaviour have been intensely studied in vitro and in vivo, their molecular evolution and structural
aspects remain poorly understood. To understand how these receptors have evolved different
physiological requirements we have investigated the molecular evolution of glutamate gated
receptors and ion channels, in particular the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which is
essential for higher cognitive function. Studies of rodent NMDA receptors show that the Cterminal intracellular domain forms a signalling complex with enzymes and scaffold proteins, which
is important for neuronal and behavioural plasticity
Results: The vertebrate NMDA receptor was found to have subunits with C-terminal domains up
to 500 amino acids longer than invertebrates. This extension was specific to the NR2 subunit and
occurred before the duplication and subsequent divergence of NR2 in the vertebrate lineage. The
shorter invertebrate C-terminus lacked vertebrate protein interaction motifs involved with
forming a signaling complex although the terminal PDZ interaction domain was conserved. The
vertebrate NR2 C-terminal domain was predicted to be intrinsically disordered but with a
conserved secondary structure.
Conclusion: We highlight an evolutionary adaptation specific to vertebrate NMDA receptor NR2
subunits. Using in silico methods we find that evolution has shaped the NMDA receptor C-terminus
into an unstructured but modular intracellular domain that parallels the expansion in complexity of
an NMDA receptor signalling complex in the vertebrate lineage. We propose the NR2 C-terminus
has evolved to be a natively unstructured yet flexible hub organising postsynaptic signalling. The
evolution of the NR2 C-terminus and its associated signalling complex may contribute to species
differences in behaviour and in particular cognitive function.

Background
One of the most striking evolutionary adaptations of
mammals is their capacity for learning and memory [1].
Such higher cognitive abilities are generally attributed to
increased brain size and elaborations of cortical structure
[2]. However the contribution that evolution of molecular
complexity of the synapse has made to cognitive properties of higher organisms has yet to be fully assessed [3].
The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is a class of
glutamate gated transmembrane ion channel that functions at the postsynaptic membrane of excitatory synapses
[4]. When opened, Ca2+ influx through the NMDA receptor into the postsynaptic cell activates second messengers
responsible for long lasting synaptic plasticity. Genetic
and pharmacological studies have shown that NMDA
receptors are necessary for normal spatial learning and its
physiological correlate of long term potentiation (LTP)
[4,5]. In addition, NMDA receptors have been shown to
be essential for activity dependant brain development, in
particular in the somatosensory and visual cortices in
adults [6].
Each NMDA receptor is a tetramer formed by two heterodimers of an obligatory NR1 subunit and one of four
possible NR2 subunits (NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, NR2D) [4].
Each subunit consists of an extracellular N-terminal
domain with three transmembrane regions (M1, M3, and
M4) and one re-entrant loop (M2) that form the channel
pore, and an intracellular C-terminal domain (Fig. 1A).
The N-terminal domains contain the ligand binding site,
while the C-terminal domain interacts with intracellular
signalling messengers including MAGUK (membrane
associated guanylate kinase binding) proteins via a PDZ
binding domain at its C-terminus. Binary protein-protein
interaction studies have identified a range of scaffold proteins and enzymes that bind to the C-terminal domain
[7], and proteomic studies have found that these proteins
are assembled into 1–2 MDa size macromolecular signalling complexes known as NRC (NMDA Receptor Complexes) or MASC (MAGUK Associated Signalling
Complexes) (Figure 1) [8,9].
Vertebrates contain four NR2 subunits with sequence similarity that suggests they are paralogues. In contrast a single NR2 orthologue is detectable in the invertebrate
lineage, supporting the view that the four NR2 subunits
seen in vertebrates are paralogues and arose from gene
duplication events. Each NR2 paralogue has distinct spatial and temporal expression patterns [10,11]. NR2A and
NR2B are expressed throughout the forebrain, including
the hippocampus. NR2C is restricted to the cerebellum
and NR2D is found predominantly in the midbrain.
Developmentally, NR2B is expressed both embryonically
and postnatally. NR2D is primarily embryonic while

NR2A and NR2C are exclusively postnatal. Phenotypes
observed after in vivo mutation of each NR2 subunit in
mice reflect the brain regions they are expressed in [1012]. Knockout (KO) of NR2A results in a deficiency in
both spatial learning and LTP, confirming its essential
function in the hippocampus [13]. NR2B shows the most
severe phenotype of neonatal death at P0 due to lack of
suckling response as well as abnormal brainstem trigeminal nucleus formation, showing its importance during
development of the forebrain [14]. NR2C KO causes a
decrease in NMDA receptor mediated currents in the granular cells of the cerebellum, and NR2A/NR2C double KOs
result in impaired motor coordination [15,16]. Thus it is
clear that since NR2 gene duplication each paralogue
acquired discrete physiological functions and discrete
developmental properties, both spatially and temporally.
The object of interest here is the intracellular 'tail' of the
NR2 subunits, which lies in the C-terminal domain. Our
impetus arises from its functional significance, originally
demonstrated in knockin mouse models where the C-termini of NR2A, NR2B, and NR2C were deleted [17]. The Cterminal deletions resulted in behavioural and electrophysiological phenotypes identical to the null mutants,
but without interfering with NMDA receptor channel formation and gating. Thus the intracellular signalling capacity of NR2 is indispensable for activity dependant NMDA
receptor function. Interestingly, recent research suggests
that differences in the intracellular signalling capacities of

NR2 subunits may account for their contrasting physiological roles in induction of synaptic plasticity (LTP) and
in neurotoxicity [18,19]. These studies have been strongly
disputed due to lack of subunit specificity of NMDA
receptor pharmacological antagonists [20,21]. Nevertheless, NR2 subunit specific interaction and phosphorylation sites have been identified and imply that NR2
subunit specific properties may me due to C-terminal variation [22]. The profound phenotypic effect of the C-terminal deletions may well be due to protein-protein
interactions between the C-terminal domain and postsynaptic signalling molecules. We examined the intracellular
domain of the NR2 sub-units using in silico methods and
infer striking evolutionary adaptations with unique structural properties.

Results
Molecular evolution of NR2
We assessed the similarity of the mouse NR2 subunit
amino acid sequences by multiple sequence alignment. It
was clear that all four NR2 paralogues show a very high
degree of similarity in their extracellular and transmembrane domains, most significantly NR2A and NR2B with
69% identity (Fig. 2). Such a high degree of conservation
implies that they are indeed of common origin, and share
the same transmembrane topology. Therefore the NR2
paralogues have remained under purifying selection since
duplication of the ancestral NR2 and are likely to retain
common function in their extracellular and transmembrane domains.

In contrast to these domains, the C-terminal intracellular
domains of the NR2 paralogues have diverged significantly, with only 9 residues conserved between the four
paralogues, primarily at the extremities of the C-terminal

domain surrounding an internal cassette (Fig. 3). The
most similar NR2 paralogues in pairwise comparisons are
NR2A and NR2B, which show 29% identity in their C-terminal domains. Although this is a significantly high similarity, it is relatively low in comparison to the N-terminal
regions. When compared on a Dotplot it is clear that their
C-terminal domains differ profoundly relative to their Nterminal domains (Fig. 4). This indicates that since duplication in the vertebrate lineage, the NR2 subunits have
retained common ancestral structure in their extracellular
and tramsmembrane domains but diversified in their
intracellular domains, suggesting specific functional
adaptations in intracellular signalling properties for each
paralogue.
In order to investigate the evolution of the ancestral C-terminal domain of NR2, alignments were performed with
sequences of various species representative of metazoan
clades including the NR2 protein sequences of invertebrates (C. elegans, D. melanogaster,); and the NR2A protein
sequences of non-mammalian chordates (D. rerio, G. gallus, X. Tropicalias); and mammals (M. domestica, C. familiaris, B. Taurus, R. norvegicus, M. musculus, M. mulata, P.

troglydytes and H. sapiens) (Fig. 5). From this alignment it
was strikingly apparent that vertebrate C-terminal
domains were substantially longer than those of invertebrates. It was also clear that, although there is much diversity between NR2 paralogues within a species within the
central portion of the NR2 C-terminus, there were many
regions of conservation between species for each NR2 subunit (Fig. 5). Strikingly, the few amino acids that are conserved between the four paralogues lie in short 'islands' at
the very beginning of the C-terminus (at G-I/M-YSC motif
at the beginning of the terminal exon) and at the very end
where the PDZ binding domain lies. This suggests that
these regions act as necessary 'sockets', one for the transmembrane domain of the NMDA receptor upstream, and
the other for interacting with PDZ containing proteins
downstream [23].
When the lengths of the NR2 C-terminal regions (defined
by the amino acid sequence starting downstream of the
last predicted transmembrane amino acid) were compared across the above species, as well as S. mansoni, A.
aegypti, G. aculeatus, C. porcellus, and O. latipes, it was
noted that the NR2 of all sequenced invertebrate species

terminal domain was run in BLASTn and tBLASTn
searches against all available genomic sequences, ESTs,
and non-redundant databases. In addition the amino acid
sequence of the four mouse NR2 C-terminal domains
were used to search the Pfam database for any domain
that might elucidate its origin or function [25]. No hits of
significance were found in either case. Exhaustive searches
of mouse NR2 C-termini with invertebrate genomes could
not identify any homologous gene or similar sequence.

are substantially shorter by up to >400 amino acids than
vertebrate NR2A/B and >200 amino acids for NR2C/D,
highlighting a stark contrast in the intracellular domain of
NMDA receptors between vertebrates and invertebrates
(Fig. 1B, Fig. 6A). The invertebrate NR2 C-terminal
domain ranges from 89 residues in C. elegans NR2 to 133
residues in D. melanogaster NR2, whereas the vertebrates
NR2A/B 'tails' range from 581 in M. mulatta NR2A to 754
residues in Oryzias latipes (Medaka) NR2B. Within the vertebrate clade the length of NR2 C-termini does not significantly vary with the exception of NR2B in Teleosts, which
is predicted from genomic sequence to carry twenty insertions. Teleosts have two copies of each NR subunit, most
likely as a consequence of the whole genome duplication
that occurred in that lineage [24], and which may have
allowed for relaxation of constraint on the second NR2B
copy.
Since the NMDA receptor is comprised of NR1 and NR2
subunits, we next asked if NR1 also showed marked differences in length between invertebrates and vertebrates.
This was not the case (Fig. 6B) and we therefore inspected
a range of other glutamate receptor subunits including
ionotropic AMPA receptors (e.g. GluR1) and metabotropic receptors (e.g. mGluR1). In mammals these receptor subunits are known to link via their C-termini to
adaptor proteins forming complexes bringing together
these different classes of glutamate receptors. Our results
show that an elongated vertebrate C-terminal domain is
unique to the NR2 glutamate receptor subunit (Fig. 6B).
To search for the origin of the vertebrate NR2 C-terminus,
the nucleotide sequence of each mouse NR2 subunit C-

Since BLAST searches of invertebrate genomes using the
mouse C-terminal NR2 protein sequence failed to find a
similar region, we inspected the NR2 invertebrate
genomic locus more closely. We had observed that the
NR2 C-terminus was noted to have conserved exonic
structure throughout vertebrates, with the vast majority of
the NR2 C-termini being encoded for in the terminal
exon. This conservation of genomic structure was not seen
in invertebrates, where the genomic sequence of the NR2
C-terminus is interrupted by introns in D. melanogaster, C.
elegans, and S. mansoni. In the case of D. melanogaster there
are two introns seperating the NR2 C-terminal domain
nucleotide sequence of 114 and 2857 nucleotides in
length, respectively (Fig. 7). When the nucleotide
sequence of mouse NR2B terminal exon was aligned with
the 2857 nucleotide intron of D. melanogaster NR2 C-termini, 41.6% identity was found by conducting a local
Smith-Waterman alignment (additional file 1). Although
this is not a strong result at the nucleotide level it may
imply that the sequences have a common origin. A similar
result (42.1%) was obtained using the corresponding NR2
C-terminal intronic sequence of S. mansoni (data not
shown).
Structural aspects of NR2 C-terminal domain evolution
Since the C-terminal domain of NR2 functions by attaching to, and organising intracellular adaptor and signalling
molecules it is possible that the diversity between NR2
paralogues is manifest at the level of protein structure. The
amino acid composition of each subunit was calculated
and it was noted that, when compared to all other constituent amino acids, NR2A and NR2B were enriched for serine, 13.2% and 12.2%, respectively, while NR2C and
NR2D were substantially enriched for proline at 14.9%
and 21.8%, respectively. It has been reported that an
amino acid composition of >6.91% serine or >12.07%
proline is indicative of intrinsically disordered proteins
[26]. We therefore used a graphic web server FoldIndex to
examine the four mouse NR2 paralogues to further predict
protein folding propensity (Fig. 8, additional file 2) [27].
A large portion of N-terminal extracellular part shows a
relatively high probability for folding, four peaks of very
high probability correspond to the four transmembrane
segments of the NR2s. In contrast to the extracellular and
transmembrane domains the entire C-terminal cytoplas-

mic tail was predicted to be intrinsically unfolded for all
four NR2s. This indicates that the intracellular tail of
NMDA receptors may under some conditions remain
unfolded.
Since the NR2 C-terminus is known to bind directly to
various interacting proteins, it might be expected that it
could adopt a secondary or tertiary structure, and it is of
interest to compare the structure of the different NR2 subunits. In the absence of 3D structure we applied the
PSIPRED Protein Structure Prediction Server to compare
the computationally predicted secondary structure of
NR2A and NR2B amino acid sequences (Fig. 9) [28]. Surprisingly, though NR2A and NR2B C-termini show low

primary sequence identity relative to the rest of the protein (29%, Fig. 4), they exhibit strikingly similar secondary structure, where the relative positioning of alpha
helices and beta sheets is conserved (Fig. 9). PSIPRED was
also applied to NR2C and NR2D but their secondary
structure predictions showed similarity neither to each
other nor NR2A or NR2B (additional file 3).

Discussion
Evolutionary features of the NMDA receptor intracellular
C-terminal domain
We used bioinformatic tools to examine the evolutionary
origins of the NR2 intracellular domain. Though it has
previously been observed that the four NR2 paralogues

(mGluR1, mGluR5). The C-termini of all the other mentioned glutamate receptors do not exhibit comparable
extensions between invertebrates and vertebrates. Thus
the vertebrate/invertebrate contrast is specific to NR2. All
of these glutamate receptor subtypes are involved with
synaptic plasticity and are linked via C-terminal domains

found in vertebrates differ in size due to variation in the
length of their C-terminal domains, the overall level of
conservation between them has not been addressed [4].
We found that there is a profound level of diversity
between the NR2 paralogues, specifically in their C-terminal intracellular domains. In contrast their N-terminal
extracellular regions are highly conserved. Generation of a
phylogenetic tree using the conserved central part of the
NMDA receptor produces a topology grouping with the
NR2A/NR2B subunits in one clade, and the NR2C/NR2D
paralogues in another (additional file 4). The C-termini
alignment reinforces this grouping since NR2A and NR2B
have clearly longer C-termini while NR2C and NR2D are
shorter. Additionally, NR2A and NR2B C-termini show a
significant degree of conservation (29%) and are serine
rich, while NR2C and NR2D (19% identical) are highly
enriched for proline. The two sub groups imply that two
separate duplications of NR2 occurred at the base of the
vertebrate lineage, with the first giving rise to protoNR2A/B and proto-NR2C/D paralogues. These have subsequently duplicated and diverged, giving rise to the four
NR2 paralogues found in extant vertebrates. Both rounds
of duplication occurred following divergence from the
urochordates, and are likely a consequence of the whole
genome duplication that took place in early chordate evolution [29].
Based on multiple species alignments of NR2 orthologues
we show that vertebrate NR2s are consistently longer than
invertebrate NR2s, and that this is due to difference in Cterminal domain length. We next asked if this vertebrate
specific intracellular extension was a feature of the NR1

The ~5 fold difference in NR2 length between vertebrates
and invertebrates may in principle result from either a vertebrate specific elongation or an invertebrate specific truncation. Since only two clades are available for comparison
here (invertebrates and vertebrates) it is not possible to
distinguish between the ancestral and the derived state.
The most parsimonious explanation for the NR2 length
difference is a loss of function in the common ancestor of
invertebrates, since a single random mutation introducing
a stop codon into the NR2 of a common ancestor of invertebrates would be sufficient to truncate the NR2 C-terminus. However this is an unlikely mechanism for
shortening of the C-terminus since both the invertebrate
and each of the vertebrate NR2 subunits have a type I PDZ
binding domain at their carboxyl termini [30,31]. We
noted that the NR2 C-terminus has a conserved exonic
structure throughout vertebrates, with the vast majority of
the NR2 C-termini being encoded for in the terminal
exon, which is in contrast to invertebrates where it is
coded by multiple exons (and the intron/exon junctions
do not show conservation within invertebrates). Interestingly, the principal intron of the D. melanogaster NR2 Cterminus bears some similarity (42%) to the terminal
exon of mouse NR2B suggesting that NR2 may have been
internally truncated due to intron gain in a common
ancestor of invertebrates. Alternatively the similarity seen
in the D. melanogaster intron may imply a vertebrate specific elongation perhaps due to the intron becoming coding, but this may be less likely due to the presence of inframe stop codons in an intron. The ancestral state of NR2
may be revealed by further genome sequencing of more
diverse and complex invertebrates. If Lophotrochozoans
were found with the elongated NR2 version, then a C-terminal truncation in the Ecdysozoan clade would be the
most parsimonious explanation [32], and if the shorter
form was unambiguously identified in a Urochordate
genome then a vertebrate specific elongation would be
supported [33].
Evolution of signalling complexes and behavior
In comparison with invertebrates, the more diverse family
of vertebrate NR2 subunits and their longer NR2 C-termini could have significant implications on the intracellular signalling capacity of the NMDA receptor channel. At
the anatomical level, the duplication of the elongated

NR2 in the vertebrate common ancestor has allowed for
each paralogue to diverge and establish distinct but overlapping anatomical and developmental roles in the mammalian brain by subfunctionalization of gene duplicates
[10,34]. At the level of signal transduction complexes, we
propose that the longer vertebrate C-terminus allowed a
greater NMDA receptor dependant signalling complexity
to evolve in vertebrates.
It is established that the mammalian NMDA receptor is in
close contact with plethora of proteins that form the NRC/
MASC (Fig. 1) [8,35]. It is reasonable to predict that the
invertebrate NR2 C-terminus would bind to a smaller set
of postsynaptic proteins: invertebrate NR2 is far shorter
and has only one identifiable interaction motif (the PDZ
binding domain). If an elongated NR2 intracellular
domain did exist in a common ancestor of invertebrates,
then we predict that those proteins within the NRC/MASC
that bind mammalian NR2 C-terminus would be found in
invertebrates. Indeed, CaMKII [36], alpha-actinin 2 [37],
PLC-gamma [38], Rack1 [39], Grit [40], Clathrin Adapter
Protein 2 [41], and the MAGUKs [30] are all molecules
that directly interact with the NMDA receptor in verte-

brates and have an orthologue in invertebrates. Moreover,
of the 186 mammalian NRC/MASC proteins there are 91
identifiable orthologues in the Drosophila melanogaster
genome (data not shown). These observations suggest
that many vertebrate NMDA receptor interactions with
cytoplasmic signalling proteins are not important to the
physiology and behaviour of invertebrates.
The expansion of the NR2 gene family has been utilised in
the mammalian brain to produce distinct functional roles.
Studies of synaptic plasticity at the CA3-CA1 synapses of
the hippocampus, using mice lacking these subunits or
with subunit specific pharmacological antagonists, reveal
differences in synaptic plasticity [12]. As mentioned
above, the subunits are expressed at different times and
locations during development of the nervous system
implying that their specific signalling functions have been
exploited to serve roles in organisation of the anatomically complex mammalian brain. The mammalian
MAGUK family of proteins, which bind to the PDZ binding domain at the C-terminus of NR2, shows a similar
evolutionary pattern of duplication followed by subfunctionalisation, with diverse expression and function

between the four paralogues (PSD-95, PSD-93, SAP-102,
and SAP97). The duplication of MAGUKs in vertebrates
complements the NR2 duplication, resulting in potentially sixteen binary configurations of NR2-MAGUK interactions, substantially increasing the level of NMDA
receptor interaction complexity in vertebrates. The specificity of these interactions has been shown to be crucial to
cognitive function in mammals, as SAP-102 deficient
mice show mild learning defects and impairments in strategy choice during behavioural assays [42], whereas PSD95 knockouts show more severe learning defects [43].
These mammalian gene specific roles in cognitive function are not found in Drosophila since the single Dlg gene
is required for viability and the phenotype of loss of Drosophila NR2 is unknown [44]. Together these studies
make a strong case that the vertebrate combinations of
NR2 and MAGUK paralogues that form key components
of synaptic signalling complexes contribute to the repertoire of cognitive behaviours. This model implies that
invertebrates do not have the same signalling diversity
and thus behavioural repertoire, which is consistent with
comparative studies of learning [1]. Our model that evolution of behaviour is impacted by evolution of complexity of signalling complexes adds to the standard model
that points to the numbers of neurons as the determinant
of behavioural evolution. Importantly, the elongated NR2
together with the vertebrate specific NR2 duplication
would have preceded the anatomical enlargement of
brain size associated with cognitive capacities of higher
animals [2].
NR2 C-terminal dynamics
The analysis of the C-terminus structure suggests a
dynamic switching function of NR2 where the domain
alternates between unfolded and folded states, and that
this modulates interactions with other proteins. The
observed high composition of both serine and proline is
a characteristic of intrinsically disordered proteins [26],
which are natively unfolded and have been associated
with 'hub' proteins in protein-protein interaction networks [45]. The adoption of a tertiary conformation, necessary for formation of a signalling complex, may occur
following binding to intracellular adaptors, for example
the PDZ domain containing proteins and CaMKII. This
may be analogous to a mechanism suggested for Kv channels, where a PDZ binding domain preceded by an intrinsically disordered intracellular C-terminus facilitates
structural flexibility as well as robust interaction with the
scaffold protein [46,47]. Since intrinsically unfolded proteins undergo a conformational change from unfolded to
folded when bound to another protein [48], the NR2 Cterminal domain should be able to form multiple conformations depending on various intracellular binding partners e.g. binding to PSD-95 induces the cytoplasmic
domain to fold into a particular 3D conformation "A" and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/9/6

binding to CaMKII induces an alternative conformation
"B". PSD-95 and CaMKII might act as cytoplasmic 'ligands' for the NMDA receptor, in an analogous manner to
extracellular ligands such as Zn+, H+, and glutamate [46],
and have allosteric effects on the the conformational state
of NR2. Consistent with this, the interaction of PSD-95
with NR2B is known to modulate NMDA receptor channel function [49]. By binding to the NR2 C-terminal
domain, these cytoplasmic ligands may in turn control
the overall function of NMDA receptors (or NMDA receptor complex) as a signalling apparatus.
This 'structural switch' model implies an evolutionary
selection on the unfolded domain. An alternative explanation is that there is no structural constraint and therefore nucleotides are free to be substituted rapidly by
neutral evolution without any structural implications. We
consider this scenario unlikely for the following reasons.
Amino acid sequences for the C-terminal domain in each
particular NR2 paralogues are well conserved between vertebrates, implying that since divergence of the NR2 paralogues each subunit has acquired structures that
underwent purifying selection in vertebrates. Furthermore, all (~10) known phosphorylation sites and proteinprotein interaction sites when mapped onto sequence
alignments for each of NR2A and NR2B were found to be
conserved throughout mammals. These interaction sites
would require a certain extent of structural constraint, and
so their conservation implies a structural framework to
the NR2 C-terminal domain. Finally there is no explanation why the predicted secondary structures for NR2A and
NR2B C-terminal domains have remained structurally
similar since they have diverged, given that they exhibit
such low similarity at the primary sequence level. The
above arguments taken together suggest that a functional
adaptation occurred in vertebrate evolution that accounts
for NR2 C-terminal structure. Within vertebrate evolution
there is evidence of further evolutionary adaptation of
NR2A, which was reported to be under significant positive
selection in primates when compared to rodents [50].
To test these evolutionary models it will be necessary to
characterise NMDA receptor associated proteins of an
invertebrate model in a comparable manner to that
achieved in mice [8,35]. Detailed experimental study on
the structure of the C-terminal domains using methods
such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy will be essential to test our structural
predictions [47], as well as to further understand how the
NMDA receptor's intracellular domain structure mediates
its role in the functional organization of the NRC. More
broadly, gene targeting should be employed to generate
new mouse models of the NR2 C-terminus with point
mutations of intracellular ligand interaction sites, paralo-

gous swaps, and trans-species chimeras to study the
molecular evolution of NMDA receptor signalling in vivo.

Conclusion
NMDA receptors display a vertebrate specific elongation
of the intracellular C-terminus of the NR2 subunit. This
extension is unique among ionotropic glutamate receptors to the NMDA receptor NR2 subunits. Significant
diversity in the NR2 C-terminus exists at the sequence
level between the four NR2 paralogues in vertebrates,
though each individual paralogue is highly conserved
amongst non-teleost vertebrates. In contrast to the extracellular and transmembrane domains, each NR2 C-terminus is predicted to be unfolded in its native state. NR2A
and NR2B C-termini are predicted to be highly similar at
the level of secondary structure though they are a poorly
conserved at the primary sequence level. We postulate that
evolution of this vertebrate specific C-terminal domain of
NR2 has resulted in an unfolded but conserved modular
structure that may have contributed to the evolution and
organisation of postsynaptic signalling complexes in vertebrates.

Methods
Sequence data & alignments
We obtained protein sequences for all genes from
Ensembl Version 36. Homologues of mouse sequences
were obtained using Ensembl BioMart [51]. Schistosoma
mansoni nucleotide sequences were obtained from the
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Pathogen Sequencing
Unit's datababse [52,53]. Multiple sequence alignments
we carried out using ClustalW [54]. Alignments were
shaded using GeneDoc [55]. Where multiple transcripts
are predicted, only a single transcript is aligned. Dotplots
were generated using the Dotmatcher program in the
EMBOSS package [56]. For comparing the length of C-terminal regions of multiple species, the C-terminus of each
protein sequence was defined as the amino acid sequence
distal of the last transmembrane residue as predicted by
TMHMM [57,58].

To generate Nucleotide alignments to find the best region
of similarity, the Smith-Waterman algorithm Water with
an EBLOSUM62 matrix was applied [56]. Phlyogentic tree
was constructed using PhyML [59].
Protein interaction data
Protein interaction data for each NR2 subunit in mammals were obtained from the Human Protein Reference
Database [7].
Similarity searches
The nucleotide sequence of the intracellular tail of each
mouse NR2 subunit were searched against non-redundant
nucleotide collection, whole genome shotgun reads, and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/9/6

expression sequence tag databases in Genbank by
BLASTn, tBLASTn, and discontiguous megablast similarity
searches, with low complexity masking [60]. To search for
conserved domains, the protein sequence of the intracellular tail of each mouse NR2 subunit was searched against
the Pfam database using the default parameters [25].
Structure predictions
Protein folding predictions were made using the FoldIndex graphic web server [27]. Prediction of secondary structure was made using PSIPRED Protein Structure
Prediction System [28].
