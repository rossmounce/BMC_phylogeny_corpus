Abstract
Background: The development of effective environmental shotgun sequence binning methods
remains an ongoing challenge in algorithmic analysis of metagenomic data. While previous methods
have focused primarily on supervised learning involving extrinsic data, a first-principles statistical
model combined with a self-training fitting method has not yet been developed.
Results: We derive an unsupervised, maximum-likelihood formalism for clustering short
sequences by their taxonomic origin on the basis of their k-mer distributions. The formalism is
implemented using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach in a k-mer feature space. We introduce
a space transformation that reduces the dimensionality of the feature space and a genomic fragment
divergence measure that strongly correlates with the method's performance. Pairwise analysis of
over 1000 completely sequenced genomes reveals that the vast majority of genomes have sufficient
genomic fragment divergence to be amenable for binning using the present formalism. Using a highperformance implementation, the binner is able to classify fragments as short as 400 nt with
accuracy over 90% in simulations of low-complexity communities of 2 to 10 species, given sufficient
genomic fragment divergence. The method is available as an open source package called LikelyBin.
Conclusion: An unsupervised binning method based on statistical signatures of short
environmental sequences is a viable stand-alone binning method for low complexity samples. For
medium and high complexity samples, we discuss the possibility of combining the current method
with other methods as part of an iterative process to enhance the resolving power of sorting reads
into taxonomic and/or functional bins.

Background
Metagenomics, the study of the combined genomes of
communities of organisms, is a rapidly expanding area of
genome research. The field is driven by environmental
shotgun sequencing (ESS), a technique of applying high-

throughput genome sequencing to non-clonal DNA purified directly from an environmental sample. This removes
the requirement to isolate and cultivate clonal cultures of
each species, allowing an unprecedented broad view of
microbial communities.

Thus far, environments such as acid mine drainage [1],
Scottish soil [2], open ocean [3], termite gut [4], human
gut [5], and neanderthal [6] have been sequenced, to
name a few. Attention has been directed to bacterial and
viral fractions of these communities, with eukaryotic
metagenomics pioneered by projects such as the marine
protist census [7]. Complexity of these communities varies greatly from 5 to several thousand identifiable bacterial species. These projects have uncovered vast amounts
of previously unobserved genetic diversity [8,9]. For
example, "deep sequencing" using 454 pyrosequencing
suggests that possibly tens of thousands of species coexist
in a single ml of seawater [10].
Given this wealth of genomic data it is becoming possible
to make increasingly precise biological inferences regarding the structure and functioning of microbial communities [11-13]. As but one example, the discovery of a novel
proteorhodopsin gene was the first step in uncovering a
previously unknown, yet apparently dominant, mechanism for phototrophy in the oceans [14]. Characterization
of functional diversity is limited by our ability to classify
sequences into distinct groups that reflect a desired taxonomic or functional resolution.
Shotgun metagenomic DNA is sequenced in fragments of
50 to 1000 nucleotides, then possibly assembled into
longer sequences (contigs). Phylogenetic binning, the task
of classifying these sequences into bins by taxonomic origin, then becomes critical to separate metagenomic data
into coherent subsets plausibly belonging to separate
organisms. This task is challenging due to the short length
of available fragments. Bacterial communities of very high
complexity, with thousands of species present, further
complicate the task.
While methods such as 16S bacterial community censuses
[15] and functional- or sequence-based screening surveys
are the forerunners of modern metagenomics, indiscriminate whole-genome shotgun sequencing may be the
defining approach of the discipline today. This approach
has recently generated vast amounts of data, facilitated by
continual capacity increases and quality improvements at
major sequencing centers and the emergence of cost effective very high throughput Next Generation sequencing
(NGS) (454 pyrosequencing [16], Illumina [17] and
SOLiD [18]). At the highest diversity levels, the reads may
not be assembled at all due to the sparseness of even the
highest throughput sequencing methods and the danger
of chimeric assemblies, arising from sampling so many
organisms at once, leaving the binner with raw reads. Binning methods therefore aim to be able to operate on very
short read lengths provided by next-generation sequencing, although most, including the present approach, are
only able to go down to 454 pyrosequencing read length

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/316

(about 400 nt) and not to microread length (30 to 100
nt).
Classic approaches to phylogenetic determination of species identities from environmental sequences rely on
identifying variants of highly conserved genes, like 16S
rRNA or recA [19]. This approach is not applicable on a
full metagenomic scale for two reasons: first, ribosomal or
marker gene sequences comprise a small fraction of the
bacterial genome, so most shotgun sequences do not contain them and cannot be classified this way; and second,
organisms with identical or closely related 16S genes have
been shown to exhibit variations in essential physiological functions [20]. Other approaches are broadly divided
into sequence similarity based classifiers such as MEGAN
[21], which rely on BLAST or other alignments, and
sequence composition based classifiers, which rely on statistical patterns of oligonucleotide distributions. Many
solutions integrate the task of phylogenetic assignment
(labeling) together with that of binning per se (clustering)
of genomic fragments. However, with unsupervised methods, like the one presented here, labeling is not possible
as part of the algorithm and has to be performed by other
means, like analyzing the correspondence of generated
clusters to known phylogenies.
Sequence classification based on oligonucleotide distributions has been the basis for gene finding applications
since the early 1990s. In 1995, Karlin and Burge [22]
noted that dinucleotide distribution is relatively constant
within genomes but varies between genomes. Since then,
this property has been extensively studied and generalized
to other oligonucleotide lengths [23]. With the advent of
ESS, several binning methods have used oligonucleotide
distributions of various orders to build supervised and
semi-supervised classifiers. These include PhyloPythia
[24], CompostBin [25], and self-organizing map (SOM)
based methods [26-28].
Machine learning-based classification algorithms like
those used for binning are categorized into supervised,
semi-supervised, and unsupervised classes. Supervised
algorithms accept a training set of labeled data used to
build their models, which are then applied to the query
data. In case of binning, this training set consists of
genomic sequences labeled according to the species they
originate from. Semi-supervised algorithms use both
training set data and query data to build their models.
Unsupervised algorithms use no training data and derive
their models directly from the query input. While methods described above have achieved considerable success
in classifying short anonymous genomic fragments, their
supervised nature makes them reliant on previously
sequenced data. For example, BLAST-based methods are
completely dependent on the presence of sequences

related to the query in the database. While semi-supervised clustering methods can have significant generalizing
power, their accuracy still depends on similarity of input
data to their training set.
To our knowledge, two approaches to unsupervised
metagenomic binning have been published. TETRA
[29,30] explores the applications of k-mer frequency statistics to metagenomic data. The authors state that their
method is suitable as a "fingerprinting technique" for
longer DNA fragments, though not as a general-purpose
binning method for single-read 454 pyrosequenced or
Sanger fragments, and an application of methods including TETRA to binning of fosmid-sized DNA is used in
[31]. Abe et al. [26] used self-organizing maps (SOM) in
combination with principal component analysis (PCA)
on 1- and 10-Kb fragments, and this method was evaluated and enhanced in [27] using growing self-organizing
maps (GSOM), an extension of SOM, on 8- and 10-kb
fragments.
Given the apparent diversity of metagenomic samples and
the significant fraction of the full bacterial phylogeny with
no sequenced representatives [20,32], as well as possible
undiscovered diversity of the tree of life, binning methods
must perform well on previously unseen data. Semisupervised methods may be able to extrapolate on this
data, but if not, unsupervised clustering will be a necessary part of a combined-method binning approach. We
present LikelyBin, a new statistical approach to unsupervised classification of metagenomic reads based on an
explicit likelihood model of short genomic fragments
[33]. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The
Methods section introduces a formal definition of the binning problem, the application of the Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) formalism, and the feature space
and likelihood model used. We discuss numerical methods used in the implementation, including a novel coordinate transformation which achieves dimension
reduction for the feature space of k-mer frequencies, and
the genomic fragment divergence measure Dn, a novel statistical measure we developed for performance evaluation
of our algorithm. The Results section presents performance evaluations of our method on mixtures of 2 to 10
species compiled from completed genomes available in
GenBank, with fragment lengths starting at 400 nt, as well
as accuracy trends over different fragment lengths and
mixing ratios. We also present results on the FAMeS [34]
dataset and compare the current method to a semi-supervised binning method based on k-mer distributions [25].
The Conclusion section explains the applicability of our
method, its speed and availability, as well as important
future directions for improvement.

Methods
The binning problem
We state the problem as follows: given a collection of N
short sequence reads from M complete genomes, how can
we predict which sequences derive from the same
genome? In our model, we represent a genome as a string
of characters deriving from a stochastic model with
parameters ï, referred to here as a master distribution. We
make the simplifying assumption that the oligonucleotide
distribution is uniform across the bacterial chromosome.
This assumption is not satisfied biologically; gene-coding,
RNA-coding, and noncoding regions, leading and lagging
strands of replication, and genomic islands resulting from
horizontal gene transfer can all exhibit distinct oligonucleotide distributions. Accurate classification of these
regions in metagenomic fragments is an open problem
which requires complex statistical models that we have yet
to incorporate into our framework, and which are targets
for subsequent model development. Nonetheless we have
found that clustering of short reads using the above
assumption is sufficiently accurate for use in low complexity metagenome samples.

Given this assumption of statistical homogeneity, we
model a collection of sequences from a single genome as
realizations of a single stochastic process. Similarly, we
model a collection of sequences from multiple genomes
as realizations of multiple stochastic processes, one per
genome, each with its own master distribution. We are
interested in determining which sequences in a metagenomic survey are likely to have been drawn from the same
genome and, consequently, the statistical distributions of
oligonucleotides within each of the master distributions.
If the number of master distributions is unknown, then
we must include some prior estimate to close the model.
Thus, even in cases where due to insufficient coverage it is
impossible to assemble disparate segments of a consensus
genome together, a binning algorithm should still be able
to group reads together based on their statistical distribution of oligonucleotides.
The simplest model of a genome would be a random collection of letters, A, T, C, and G. The master distribution
of a single genome can then be represented as a single
probability, pA, denoting the fraction of A-s in the
genome. Base complementarity requires pA = pT and pC = 1/
2 - pA = pG. A more complex representation would be to
assume that genomes are random collections of k-mers.
When k = 1, each nucleotide is independent of the previous. When k = 2, the genomes are random collections of
dimers and so on. However, when k ï³ 2, inherent symmetries are present in this representation since all but the
first letters of the current k-mer are also contained in the
next k-mer. In a metagenomic dataset, each short fragment derives from a single master distribution, ï±i, which

is represented a fraction fi of times. How then can we infer
the most likely ï ïº (ï±1, ï±2, ..., ï±M) and F ïº (f1, f2, ..., fM)
given a set of N sequences S ïº (s1, s2, ..., sN)? To do so, we
must calculate the likelihood (S|ï, F) of observing the
sequences S given the parameters ï and F. Then, we must
estimate the values of ï and F that maximize the likelihood . Below, we demonstrate the use of a MCMC algorithm to perform this task.
MCMC framework

FIGURE 1 We are interested in finding the values of ï and
F that maximize the likelihood, . The MCMC approach
has been described in detail elsewhere [35]. Given an initial parameter setting and a metagenomic data set, we
implement the following Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
to MCMC maximum likelihood estimation: (i) Determine the likelihood of the dataset (ï, F|S); (ii) Choose
some ï = ï + dï, and G = F + dF and determine its likelihood, ' (ï, G), such that both ï and G exist in the same
high-dimensional simplex as ï and F respectively; (iii)
Accept the new value given a probability 1 if ' (ï, G) > '(ï,
F) and with probability ' (ï, G)/(ï, F) otherwise; (iv)
Ë
Repeat, and after a burn-in period determine the values Î

Ë
and F which maximize (S|ï, F). We can then utilize the
resulting model of sequence parameters to classify
sequences and estimate the most likely oligonucleotide

Likelihood model
Consider a nucleotide sequence s = c1 c2 c3, ..., cá. We

would like to know the probability of observing such a
sequence given some underlying model. We assume that
our sequence is selected from broken pieces of doublestranded DNA, and thus that complementary nucleotide
sequences have the same probability: i.e., L(s) = L(s'),
where sâ² = câ²ï¬ ï câ² , and câ²i is the nucleotide complemen1
tary to the nucleotide ci. We assume that the probability of
our sequence is determined by a set of 2k k-mer probabilities p c1ïc k .
That is, we write:

where Pm(si) is the probability of generating the i-th
sequence given the m-th master distribution.
A simple example of likelihood computation according to
the described model is given in the Appendix.
The space of k-mer frequencies
Given the assumption of uniformity of the k-mer (oligonucleotide) distribution across each genome, we can
impose three kinds of constraints on the k-mer frequency
k

space. This space is a subspace of R 4 , subject to three
kinds of constraints: all k-mer frequencies sum to 1, e.g.

p AAA + p AAT + ï + p CCC = 1;
each k-mer has the same frequency as its complement; and
all marginal probabilities are consistent over all margins,
e.g.

p AAA + p AAT + p AAG + p AAC = p AA .
We then derive a transformation of the original k-mer frequency vector, x = [pA, pT, pG, pC, pAA, pAT, pAG, pAC, pTA, ...],
into the independent coordinate space. To generalize and
automate the process, we perform it for each case from 1mers (4 dimensions before removing redundancies) to 5mers (1364 dimensions before removing redundancies)
by generating all equations governing the constraints
above. We use the notation [A|b] to denote the matrices of
the constraint equation Ax = b by generating rows for each
constraint type. For example, for k = 2, we write the summation, complementarity and marginality constraints as
follows:

We find the nullspace of the resulting matrix A and use it
to perform the transformation. The resulting number of
independent dimensions is shown in Table 1. The MCMC
simulation then performs the search in the independent
coordinate space. For k > 6, the matrix A becomes too big
to compute its nullspace using a non-parallelized algorithm. Even for k = 6, the number of independent dimensions is so large that the MCMC simulation takes an
intractable amount of time. Therefore, we only generalize
our algorithm up to k = 5.
Initial conditions
The choice of initial conditions can dramatically alter the
speed of convergence of a MCMC solver. We used the
same initial conditions for comparison of model results,
specified by the frequencies of k-mers in the entire dataset
provided as input (i.e., the weighted average of all sources'
contributions to the dataset). Other possibilities, implemented but not chosen as the default, include taking uniformly distributed frequencies, randomizing the starting
condition, or using principal components analysis with Kmeans clustering to obtain initial cluster centroids. We
verified that convergence, when it did occur, did not
depend sensitively on initial conditions (Additional files
1 and 2).
Finding the maximum likelihood model
Once the predefined number of timesteps has elapsed, the
model with the largest log likelihood is selected. Note that
the MCMC framework is amenable to a Bayesian

approach, which we implemented as an alternative. Once
the equilibrium state has been reached we calculate the
autocorrelation of frequencies and estimate a window
over which frequencies show no significant autocorrelations. Given a specified prior distribution p(ï, F) for the
master distribution and frequencies, the Metropolis-Hastings approach will converge to the true posterior distribution of ï° (ï, F|S) ïµ (S|ï, F) p(ï, F). In our case we used
an uninformed prior distribution so long as positivity and
all other specified constraints among k-mer probabilities
were preserved. We then sample from the equilibrium
state to find ï° (ï, F). Averages of master distributions in
the posterior distribution also preserve the constraint conditions because of the linearity of the averaging operator.
Accuracy of the model was similar whether using the maximum likelihood model or the average of the posterior
distribution (Additional file 3). Full posterior distributions of k-mer models could be used to estimate posterior
distributions of binning accuracy.

and note that the innermost fraction contains higherorder terms when working with Markov chain orders
higher than 2. The innermost product term is a product of
on the order of 1000 terms of magnitude ï» 1/4. However,
1/4n exceeds double floating point precision at n ï» 540. To
prevent underflow, we find the Pm(si) of highest magnitude and divide the inner sum by it. This allows log space
evaluation of the highest magnitude term and ensures
that any terms whose precision is lost are at least ï» 1e300

If

this

exceeds 0, the new model is more likely to be observed
than the old.
The MCMC iteration loop was implemented with the
Metropolis-Hastings criterion. From an initial model, a
perturbed model MN is generated. The new model's probability is evaluated as above and compared to that of the
currently selected model MC. If higher, the new model is
selected; otherwise, the new model is selected with probability p = exp (log (MN|S) - log (MC|S)). The step is
repeated N times (N is fixed at 40000 for the experiments
described). Each selected model is stored in a model
record for later sampling.
Computing the perturbation
The statistical model consists of sub-models for each
source. The perturbation step is performed for every submodel independently. Every sub-model consists of a complete k-mer frequency vector, {pA, pT, pG, pC, pAA...}. It is
perturbed by scaling each vector of the basis matrix A by a
random number ri drawn from a Gaussian distribution
with mean 0 and constant variance (computed as
described below), then adding each scaled vector in succession to the frequency vector. The basis matrix A is
precomputed for each k-mer model order from 2 to 5 and
supplied with the program. The computation is performed by generating a system of equations representing
the base complementarity, marginal, and summation
constraints and using the standard nullspace algorithm
supplied with GNU Octave.

The perturbation step variance must be calibrated independently for each dataset. An excessive variance will
result in too many suboptimal perturbations as well as
perturbations placing the frequency vector outside the
unit hypercube (those perturbations are rejected). A variance that is too small can result in an inability to escape
local maxima in the model search space and an inability
to reach the stationary phase before the pre-determined
number of steps is taken. To calibrate the variance, the
MCMC iteration is started independently for a reduced
number of steps, and different variances ranging from 1e
- 3 down to 1e - 8 are tried. With each trial, the number of
new model acceptances is recorded. We consider the frac# acceptances

tion f = # timesteps . Once the variance yielding f closest
to 0.234 is found (a heuristic level of acceptances that has
become standard [35], p. 504), we use this variance for the
main run. Convergence to the stationary phase occurred
after 40,000 iterations in all cases of interest.

Computing the prediction
To derive the final model prediction, the model with the
overall maximum log likelihood is selected. The full
MCMC simulation is repeated a selected number of times
(to increase performance, the classifier was run in parallel
on an 8-core machine; each core was assigned to run one
MCMC simulation for a total of 8 restarts). Final model
predictions are compared between different runs, and the
best overall prediction is selected according to its model
likelihood (described above).

The classifier then assigns a putative source to each
sequence fragment it was initially queried with. For every
fragment, its likelihood according to each sub-model in
the final predicted model is computed, and the sub-model
supplying the highest likelihood is selected. Since the
sources are anonymous, they are referred to simply by
indices from 1 to n corresponding to each sub-model's
index in the final predicted model. Figure 2 illustrates the
log likelihood comparison process for all fragments in a
given dataset, according to the best model selected as a
result of this process.
Testing methodology
Simulated metagenomic datasets were created by selecting
two or more genomic sequences as source DNA. Sequence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/316

fragments were selected at random positions within
source sequences; overlaps were allowed to occur. Fragment size was fixed for all fragments for each experiment.
The total number of fragments per source was selected
either according to overall source length or at specified frequency ratios (e.g., 2:1, 10:1:1). The number of sources in
each testing dataset was supplied to the classifier.
Accuracy of the classifier is calculated as follows. Every
possible matching of source genomic sequence names to
classifier output indices is considered, e.g. {seq1 ï® 1, seq2
ï® 2}, {seq1 ï® 2, seq2 ï® 1}. The number of correct assignments made by the classifier is then counted for each
matching and the matching with the highest number of
correct assignments is selected. Accuracy is then given as
# correct assignments
# fragments

. To evaluate separability of the ran-

domly generated datasets according to the classifier's
model, we also define and compute the genomic fragment
divergence between two sources' k-mer distributions. First,
we compute the mean, ï­, and standard deviation, ï³, of
each k-mer frequency for each source across fragments
originating from that source. The genomic fragment divergence of k-mer order n is then given by

Results and Discussion
The accuracy and applicability of the present method in
binning short sequence fragments from low complexity
communities (2-10 species) was systematically analyzed
using a variety of species, varying fragment lengths, and
varying ratios of fragment representation.
First, a set of 1055 completed bacterial chromosomes was
retrieved from GenBank. This set was randomly sampled

for sets of 2, 3, 5, 10 genomes at a time, representative of
various genomic fragment k-mer distribution divergences.
Binning results for nearly 1800 simulated communities
comprised of 2 or 3 genomes at a time are summarized in
the top panels of Figure 4. There is a strong positive correlation between genomic fragment divergence and average
performance. Classification accuracy was consistently
above 85% for fragment divergences when D3 > 2. Results
for Bayesian posterior distribution sampling were not
substantially different (Additional file 3).
Accuracy of binning simulated communities of 5-10 species was consistent with the results from 2-3 species communities. The accuracy of binning was strongly positively
correlated with genomic fragment divergence with accuracies consistently above 85% for D3 > 2. Note that accurate
binning was possible when fragment length was either L =
400 nt or L = 800 nt (middle and bottom panels of Figure
4 respectively). For 5 and 10 species, a total of 1815 simulated communities were tested in the L = 400 nt case and
a total of 425 simulated communities were tested in the L
= 800 nt case.
Next, we evaluated the robustness of our binning method
to changes in fragment length and to changes in fragment
ratios using five distinct genome pairs from the preceding
experiment (see Table 2). The pairs were selected based on
their relatively low genomic fragment divergence, D3 ï» 1,
given a fragment length of L = 400 nt. Binning results on
these 2-species tests were evaluated using sequence fragments whose lengths ranged from 40 to 1000 nt. The
results are shown in Figure 5. Performance stabilizes close
to its optimal value at fragment length 400. Again, results
for Bayesian posterior distribution sampling were not

selected pairs are observed to have divergences above this line.

1 is in the high performance range (accuracy > 0.9), while above divergence 3 accuracy is above 0.9 for over 95% of the trials.
Results for Bayesian posterior distribution sampling were not significantly different (Additional file 3).

approach (Table 3).
For the same five pairs as in Figure 5, we performed a test
of fragment ratio-dependent contributions to accuracy
(Figure 6). The binner successfully classifies mixtures with
species' fractional content of 20% and above. Although
robust to moderate variation in fragment ratios, these
results indicate that binning relatively rare species may
require modifications to the present likelihood formalism.
We also tested our method using subsets of the JGI FAMeS
[34,37] simulated low-complexity dataset (simLC). We
took 5 genomic sources at a time, using 500 fragments,
each of length L = 400 nt. The accuracy results for binning
these simulated low complexity communities are summarized in Table 4. The binning method has approximately
80% accuracy for a five-species community despite the
genomic divergence, D3, being approximately 1.5 (an
indicator of a community with similar k-mer distributions).

our method performs on par with or better than CompostBin, even though CompostBin required a fraction of
input fragments to be labeled to initialize its clustering
algorithm. Run time and memory performance was comparable between the two methods.
The algorithm is implemented in portable Perl and C code
that can be compiled and run on any platform supporting
a Perl interpreter. Both memory use and run time scale linearly with the number of fragments and species, and sublinearly with fragment length. Memory complexity scales
quadratically with the number of dimensions in the
search space, or exponentially with k (as shown in Table
1). We selected k = 3 as the default k-mer length, with userdefined options for 2, 4, or 5 available. We have not yet
formalized convergence time performance as a function of
k. In practice, a 3-species dataset of 1000 fragments per
species, with k-mer order set to 3, takes approximately 2
minutes to run on an Intel Core 2 Duo-class processor.

Conclusion
We also compared our method to CompostBin [25], a
semi-supervised algorithm that utilizes a PCA method to
bin fragments based on their k-mer distributions (Table
5). We performed comparisons on pairs of genomes with

We developed an unsupervised, maximum likelihood
approach to the binning problem - called LikelyBin. LikelyBin uses a MCMC framework to estimate the set of master distributions and relative frequencies most likely to

give rise to an observed collection of short reads. The likelihood approach is based on k-mer distributions, for
which we developed an index of separability of any pair of
genomes, which we termed the genomic fragment divergence measure, Dn. We found that the vast majority of
genomes have sufficient divergence to be distinguished
using the present method (Figure 3).
Using a high-performance implementation, LikelyBin can
be used to cluster sequences with high accuracy (in some

cases, > 95%) even when the mononucleotide content of
the original genomes is essentially identical (Figure 4).
The method does as well or better than a comparable
semi-supervised method (CompostBin [25]) that also
uses k-mer distributions as the statistical basis for binning
(Table 5).
Performance of LikelyBin is consistently good for synthesized low-complexity datasets (2-10 species) with fragments of length as low as 400 nt, which corresponds to

the characteristic single-read length of a 454 pyrosequencing FLX machine. Microread sequencing technologies
such as Solexa and SOLiD are currently out of reach of any
non-alignment-based binning method when applied to
single reads, which range from 30 to 50 base pairs with
these technologies.
The unsupervised nature of our approach makes it potentially useful for classifying mixtures of novel sequences for
which supervised learning-based methods may have difficulties. A future direction for our work is to combine our
statistical formalism with alignment and supervised composition-based models. For example, we could develop a
feature selection framework that would transform the
input fragments' features such as k-mer statistics, coding
frame information, and variable-length motifs into a
lower-dimensional space. We could then feed these features to an unsupervised MCMC-based classifier in tandem with an alignment-based classifier that can partially
label fragments based on known taxonomic information,
then compare and combine their results.
A number of challenges remain to broaden the scope and
applicability of the current method. At present, our
method is scalable for k-mer length from k = 2 to k = 5. We
intend to expand the method's ability to capture longer
motif frequencies by using dimension transformation or
feature selection in a future work. Intra-genomic heterogeneity of oligonucleotide distributions is another topic that
is yet to be addressed. A confidence measure that serves as
a performance self-check is already available as part of our
method but we have not incorporated it into the program's output yet.
Further, applying the current method in an environmental
context requires an estimation of the number of bins. The
problem of identifying the necessary number of distinct
models, or groups thereof, to represent all components of
a given genome, is related to the problem of identifying
the number of distinct genomes in the mixture. A combination of jump diffusion and grouped models is our currently planned solution. In this respect, the use of
phylogenetic markers to estimate the number of bins will
provide important prior information.
In summary, the unsupervised method we proposed is
based on a maximum likelihood formalism and can bin
short fragments (L = 400 nt) of low complexity communities (2-10 species) with high accuracy (in some cases, >
95%) given sufficient genomic divergence. The maximum
likelihood formalism and its MCMC implementation
make the current approach amenable to extension and
incorporation into other packages. The MCMC binner
application is provided as an open-source downloadable
package, LikelyBin [33], that can be installed on any plat-

Convergence dynamics. Figure 1: Convergence dynamics for good accuracy, Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum ATCC 27343 vs.
Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni 81-176 (D3 = 2.8). A single
MCMC simulation was completed for this pair of genomes as described in
Methods. k-mer order 3 model was used with 30000 steps, and expected
nucleotide frequencies in accepted models were plotted over time for all
independent mono- and dinucleotides in the model. Two starting conditions were compared: uniform initial frequencies (solid line) and frequencies at dataset mean (dashed line). Dotted lines indicate true average
frequencies in the constituent species' fragment datasets. Convergence was
observed to be substantially the same, demonstrating robustness of the
algorithm to initial starting conditions. Final model accuracy was ï» 95%
in both cases.

Accuracy-divergence dependencies for Bayesian sampling. Figure 3:
Pairs and triples of genomes were sampled randomly from a set of 1055
completed bacterial chromosomes, and experiments were conducted using
Bayesian posterior distribution sampling on the stationary distribution of
the MCMC simulation. The results were found to not be significantly different from those for maximum likelihood sampling (Figure 4).
