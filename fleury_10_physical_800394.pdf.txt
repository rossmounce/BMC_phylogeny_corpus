Abstract
Background: Physical maps employing libraries of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones are essential for
comparative genomics and sequencing of large and repetitive genomes such as those of the hexaploid bread wheat.
The diploid ancestor of the D-genome of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum), Aegilops tauschii, is used as a resource for
wheat genomics. The barley diploid genome also provides a good model for the Triticeae and T. aestivum since it is only
slightly larger than the ancestor wheat D genome. Gene co-linearity between the grasses can be exploited by
extrapolating from rice and Brachypodium distachyon to Ae. tauschii or barley, and then to wheat.
Results: We report the use of Ae. tauschii for the construction of the physical map of a large distal region of
chromosome arm 3DS. A physical map of 25.4 Mb was constructed by anchoring BAC clones of Ae. tauschii with 85 EST
on the Ae. tauschii and barley genetic maps. The 24 contigs were aligned to the rice and B. distachyon genomic
sequences and a high density SNP genetic map of barley. As expected, the mapped region is highly collinear to the
orthologous chromosome 1 in rice, chromosome 2 in B. distachyon and chromosome 3H in barley. However, the
chromosome scale of the comparative maps presented provides new insights into grass genome organization. The
disruptions of the Ae. tauschii-rice and Ae. tauschii-Brachypodium syntenies were identical. We observed chromosomal
rearrangements between Ae. tauschii and barley. The comparison of Ae. tauschii physical and genetic maps showed
that the recombination rate across the region dropped from 2.19 cM/Mb in the distal region to 0.09 cM/Mb in the
proximal region. The size of the gaps between contigs was evaluated by comparing the recombination rate along the
map with the local recombination rates calculated on single contigs.
Conclusions: The physical map reported here is the first physical map using fingerprinting of a complete Triticeae
genome. This study demonstrates that global fingerprinting of the large plant genomes is a viable strategy for
generating physical maps. Physical maps allow the description of the co-linearity between wheat and grass genomes
and provide a powerful tool for positional cloning of new genes.
Background
Although wheat is a major food for the world population
and the most extensively grown crop, progress in genomics had been slowed due to the size and the complexity of
the genome. The hexaploid genome of common wheat
(Triticum aestivum) contains 16,000 Mb of DNA orga* Correspondence: delphine.fleury@acpfg.com.au

nized into three genomes, A, B and D, with 7 chromosomes each. This makes the wheat genome far larger than
the sequenced rice genome at 430 Mb [1] and Brachypodium genome at 271 Mb [2]. T. aestivum evolved via two
hybridization events. The first event combined the A and
B genomes into tetraploid wheat while the second hybridization event, which took place only about 8,500 years
ago [3] and involved tetraploid wheat and diploid Ae.
tauschii [4], contributed the D genome. Due to the recent

tauschii [5], the D genome shows low polymorphism, and
the genetic maps of the D genome chromosomes still
tend to be poor.
Physical mapping strategies employing libraries of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones can potentially
generate maps of a genome without extensive polymorphism and facilitate studying the structure of the genome,
comparison with other genomes and map-based cloning
of genes. Physical maps are also the prerequisite step for
the sequencing and assembly of large and repetitive
genomes such as those of wheat. Most physical mapping
in wheat has generally targeted small regions covered by a
few BAC clones. Two recent studies presenting physical
map of the wheat chromosome 3B [6] and the short arm
of chromosome 3AS and 3DS [7] exemplify a strategy
adopted by the International Wheat Genome Sequencing
Consortium http://www.wheatgenome.org/ for physical
mapping of the 21 wheat chromosomes. The strategy
makes use of BAC libraries constructed from DNA of single chromosomes or single chromosome arms isolated by
chromosome or chromosome arm flow sorting [8]. A
complementary approach is to construct physical maps of
wheat diploid relatives and use the maps for the construction of the physical maps of the wheat chromosomes. Of
the three diploid ancestors of T. aestivum, this strategy is
the most applicable to Ae. tauschii because of high
homology between its chromosomes and those of the
wheat D genome. To further enhance the utility of Ae.
tauschii physical map for using it as a resource for wheat
D-genome genomics, an accession from the presumptive
area of the origin of T. aestivum [5] showing a short
genetic distance to the wheat D genome was used for the
construction of Ae. tauschii BAC libraries [9] and BAC
contigs [10]. This accession has also been used recently
for the construction of extensive comparative map of Ae.
tauschii based on ESTs (expressed-sequence-tags) with
the rice and sorghum genome sequences [11].
The barley diploid genome is only slightly larger than
the wheat D genome and, like Ae. tauschii, genetic maps
are well populated with molecular markers making it
another good model for the Triticeae and T. aestivum.
Barley and Ae. tauschii comparative mapping have shown
that the grass genomes are highly collinear and gene
order is conserved across chromosomes [11,12]. Gene colinearity can be exploited by extrapolating the knowledge
obtained on simpler model species to more complex species: from rice or sorghum to Ae. tauschii or barley, and
then from them to wheat.
Here we report the construction of the physical map of
a large portion of Ae. tauschii chromosome arm 3DS
delineated by an X-ray induced deletion mutation called
pairing homoeologous 2a (ph2a) and initially located on
the distal 20 cM of the arm [13]. We describe here the

assembly of Ae. tauschii BACs into contigs and their
ordering based on the Ae. tauschii comparative genetic
map [11]. By superimposing the physical map of the 3DS
region on the Ae. tauschii recombination map, we estimate recombination rates along the chromosome arm
and the gaps in the physical map. We also describe its
synteny with Brachypodium and rice genomic sequences
and the barley genetic map.

Results
Physical map of a distal region of chromosome 3DS in Ae.
tauschii

Using the southern blot data from a previous study [13],
we first identified the wheat deletion bins [14] overlapping the ph2a deletion. Among 53 ESTs mapped into the
region deleted in ph2a, 8 EST mapped to 6 deletion bins
of group 3 chromosomes: the telomeric bin 3AS4-0.451.00; the 3 bins 3BS8, 3BS9 and 3BS1 covering the chromosome arm from 0.33 to 1.00 (ratio of chromosome arm
length); the bins 3DS6 and 3DS3 from position 0.24 to
1.00 [14]. The GrainGenes database http://
wheat.pw.usda.gov contained a total of 591 ESTs that had
been mapped to these 6 bins. These ESTs including 53
EST mapped within the ph2a deletion were assembled
into 151 unigenes according to the DFCI wheat gene
index database http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi and
used for BAC anchoring. To decrease the chance of
hybridizing repeat elements, probes used for the BAC
library screening contained only exon sequence. PCR
products for 110 unigenes of wheat were verified by
direct sequencing and used as markers. Eighty probes
gave clean results by hybridization onto restricted DNA
of nullisomic-tetrasomic wheat lines and were then used
for hybridization to the Ae. tauschii BAC high density
screening membranes.
Using 68 such probes identified 278 positive BAC
clones. These clones had been previously assembled
based on fingerprints into contigs containing 3,289 BACs
http://wheatdb.ucdavis.edu/. We screened the 3,289
clones with 42 additional PCR markers which could not
be used for hybridization because of the poor probe quality. After validation of marker presence on clones by PCR,
1,802 BAC clones were re-assembled into 24 contigs with
a size that ranged from 188 to 3,935 kb (Table 1). The
physical map covered 25.4 Mb which is about one third of
the target region initially estimated to be about 80 Mb by
comparison with rice genomic sequence [13]. The physical map included a total of 90 loci, composed of 85 unigenes and 5 genomic based markers (See Additional File 1).
A contig contained an average of 3.7 markers (ranging
from 1 to 17 markers). The genes were organized in 54
gene islands defined by the presence of at least 1 gene on
one BAC. Among those, 19 different gene islands were

identified with at least 2 genes and up to 5 genes on a single clone.
Due to the low polymorphism of the T. aestivum D
genome, the wheat genetic maps are poorly populated
with molecular markers and not informative enough for
anchoring BAC contigs on a map. Therefore, whenever
possible we have anchored the BAC contigs onto the Ae.
tauschii genetic map built from AL8/78 × AS75 F2 mapping population [11]. The fact that one of the parents
(AL8/78) was also used for the construction of the BAC
libraries greatly assisted the anchoring of contigs on the
genetic map. A contig was anchored only when a clone in
the contig and a marker on the map contributed by AL8/
78 had exactly the same phenotype. Eleven EST markers
and one ISBP marker were used to align 14 contigs onto
the Ae. tauschii genetic map (Figure 1 and Additional File
2). The remaining contigs were ordered as follows. Contigs (ctg) 1, 2, 21, 23 and 24 were ordered according to the
3B physical map [6]. Ctg 13, 14 and 20 were anchored and
positioned in the order of the barley genetic map. Ctg 15
and 16 could not be anchored on a Triticeae map and
were ordered according to the order of orthologous genes
in the rice genome.
Recombination along the distal region of chromosome 3DS

Meiotic recombination activity was evaluated by calculating the recombination rate or coefficient of exchange
(CE) in cM per Mb. Although the actual length of a contig
can not be known without BAC sequencing, the physical
size of a contig was evaluated based on the number of
common bands (CB units) between BAC fingerprints.
The average size of 1 CB was 1.9 kb for this Ae. tauschii
library http://wheatdb.ucdavis.edu. The average CE along
the map was 2.35 cM/Mb between the most distant
markers TC281750 of ctg3 and BE446087 of ctg22 (49.9
cM and 11,187 CB) (Table 2). Local CE was also measured for two pairs of markers physically linked on the
ctg4 and ctg12: respectively 2.19 and 1.42 cM/Mb. In the
proximal region, we calculated the physical distance
between the markers BG604577 and BE446087 by adding
the size of ctg17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 neglecting the gaps
between them. With a genetic distance of 0.78 cM, the CE

was 0.09 cM/Mb. The recombination rate decreased in
Ae tauschii from the distal region of ctg4, through the
middle region of ctg12 to the proximal ctg17-22.
Synteny with B. distachyon, rice and barley

By comparing the Ae. tauschii physical map of 3DS to the
B. distachyon 8× genome sequence, 53 wheat unigenes
were orthologous to B. distachyon chromosome Bd2. A
distal inversion occurred in the region between 834 and
1,105 kb of Bd2 matching the ctgs 3, 4 and 5 of Ae.
tauschii (Figure 2). Separated by a large conserved block
of about 2,035 kb in Brachypodium, a second large inversion has occurred in the proximal region between the
ctgs 17 to 24 of Ae. tauschii and Bd2-3,140 and Bd2-4,211
kb. Compared to the rice genomic sequence, the Ae.
tauschii map is highly collinear to chromosome 1 with 70
wheat unigenes of the Ph2 physical map orthologous to
59 rice genes of Os1 (See Additional File 1). They showed
the same chromosomal rearrangements between 3DS
and Os1 that have been previously described by using the
same Ae. tauschii genetic map [11]. The synteny profile of
Ae. tauschii-B. distachyon is almost identical to the one of
Ae. tauschii-rice, showing the same inverted and conserved blocks (See Additional File 2).
A comparison was made with the genetic map of barley
3HS derived from the Steptoe x Morex doubled haploid
population populated with gene-based SNP [15] and
Transcript Derived Markers [16] loci. A total of 24 unigenes homologous between wheat and barley were used to
integrate the Ae. tauschii physical map and the barley
genetic map. Sixteen contigs were therefore anchored
onto 15 barley genetic map positions (Figure 2). Synteny
was conserved on a large block between the two species,
from ctg 8 to 24. A region of 8.1 cM in length in barley
has been rearranged in Ae. tauschii between ctgs 3, 4 and
5. This observation is supported by the anchoring of 3
markers of ctg4, which was oriented and positioned onto
the Ae. tauschii genetic map. This rearrangement overlapped the distal rice-Ae. tauschii inversion previously
described. It could either be due to an inversion between
Ae. tauschii and barley leading to the translocation of
ctg6 and 7 in a more distal region in barley, or to the

proximal translocation of ctg 3-distal part of ctg4 in
barley.
The disruption of co-linearity between genomes is due
to chromosomal rearrangements which occurred after

the divergence of the two species from their common
ancestor [17]. With the hypothesis of minimum chromosomal rearrangements occurring before speciation, we
propose a model explaining the discontinuities in rice, B.
distachyon, barley and Ae. tauschii synteny along the distal region of chromosome 3DS (Figure 3). The segment 5
(corresponding to ctg 17-24) was conserved between Ae.
tauschii and barley while it appeared inverted between
Ae. tauschii and rice/B. distachyon, and between barley
and rice/B. distachyon (Figure 2). This proximal inversion
probably took place in the Triticeae ancestor after its
divergence from a common ancestor of Oryzae and Brachypodium lineages.
Additional rearrangements seemed to have occurred in
the distal region after the divergence of the Triticum/
Aegilops lineage from the Hordeum lineage. The ctg3-4-5
of the map showed inversions between Ae. tauschii and
rice (LOC_Os01g02870-LOC_Os01g03160) (See Additional File 2). It partially overlapped the inversion
observed between the barley region 8.9 cM-16.3 cM and
the rice sequence LOC_Os01g03070-LOC_Os01g04020
(Figure 2). Thus, the segment 3 (ctg6-7) was collinear
between rice/Brachypodium and Ae. tauschii while it was
inside the inverted block between rice and barley. A
translocation of the ctg3-distal ctg4 segment in a more
proximal region in barley wouldn't explain the difference
of synteny of the segment 3 between Ae. tauschii, barley
and rice. A possible explanation would be some overlapping inversions with different chromosomal breakpoints
in the Triticum/Aegilops and the Hordeum radiations
(Figure 3). The block formed by segments 1 and 2 (corresponding to ctg3-4-5) would be inverted in the Triticum/
Aegilops radiation, with the breakpoints A and C, while in
Hordeum, the breakpoints may have occurred in B
(within ctg4) and D leading to the inversion of a block
formed by segments 2 and 3 (corresponding to a part of
ctg4 and ctg5-6-7-8).

Discussion
Beside the Ph2 locus, which is a suppressor of homoeologous chromosome pairing [13], other genes of interest
have been previously mapped on chromosome 3DS
including a resistance to tan spot [18], the brittle rachis
gene [19], the Gigantea gene [20] and the developmental
gene Sphaerococcoid S1 [21]. Some QTLs associated to
yield components [22-24], spike length [25], black point
resistance [26], resistance to Fusarium head blight Fhb
[27], and grain protein content [28] have also been identified on 3DS. In addition, genes coding for several metabolic enzymes are located on 3DS: esterase 1, hexokinase1,2, malic enzyme, peroxydase and triosphosphate
isomerase [29]. Although a total of 57 molecular markers
were found on chromosome 3D of the consensus genetic
map of hexaploid wheat [30], the linkage group 3D usually shows only 10 to 20 markers for a specific segregating

population [19,22,23,25]. This low density of markers
makes the isolation of specific genes on the 770 Mb of
chromosome 3D almost impossible. The difficulty could
be overcome by using physical and genetic maps of Ae.
tauschii [31].
We have used the Ae. tauschii genomic resources and a
specific deletion bin (ph2a) to make the first physical map
of part of a large plant genome based on global fingerprinting of the whole genome. The gaps in the map were
evaluated by comparing the average CE along the region
with the CE previously reported in wheat. If the average
recombination is similar between wheat chromosomes,
the difference observed would be due to a difference in
physical distance. The average CE of the map was 2.35
cM/Mb, which is much higher than the maximum CE
observed for all wheat chromosomes (0.87 cM/Mb) and
for wheat chromosome 3BS (0.85 cM/Mb) [32,33]. The
rate is about triple of previous reports, meaning that the
actual physical distance would be 73 Mb, which is close to
the estimated size of the ph2a deletion (80 Mb).
Comparison of the size of rice and Ae. tauschii short
arm chromosomes reveals a genomic inference between
the two species. The Ph2 map spanned 4.3 Mb of the distal region of rice short arm chromosome 1, from
LOC_Os01g02090 to LOC_Os01g09580 [13]. The rice
Os1S and wheat 3DS arms are respectively 17.1 Mb and
321 Mb long [6,34]. The increase of genome size between
rice and Ae. tauschii would be 17× for the distal half (4.3
Mb in rice, 73 Mb in Ae. tauschii) and 19× for the proximal half of chromosome (12.8 Mb in rice, 248 Mb in Ae.
tauschii). When rice genome was compared to sorghum
genome, the genome size increase was entirely accounted
for by the increase in the proximal heterochromatic
regions [35]; the distal euchromatic regions were of identical lengths in the two species. The increase in genome
size in the Triticeae is nearly equivalent in the distal and
proximal regions, suggesting that the growth of Triticeae
genomes took place along the entire chromosomes, in
contrast to small sorghum genome where the growth
took place only in the proximal region.

In plants, the recombination rate is higher in genedense regions and towards the telomeres and lower in
centromeric regions [36], although reversals of this pattern exist. In wheat and barley, meiotic recombination
rate follows a gradient along the chromosome arms
decreasing from the telomere to the centromere [32,37].
The recombination rates along the 3DS region in Ae.
tauschii dropped from 2.19 cM/Mb in the distal region to
0.09 cM/Mb in the proximal region. The CE in the distal
and middle regions (2.19 and 1.42 cM/Mb) were calculated to be much higher for single contigs than the rate in
the distal 3BS8 and 3BS7 bins (respectively 0.85 and 0.37
cM/Mb) [33]. In the proximal region, although the CE is
overestimated due to the gaps between the contigs, the
value is lower (0.09 cM/Mb) than the one of the orthologous bin 3BS9 (0.17 cM/Mb) [33]. Considering that the
ctgs 17-22 were anchored on 3DS6-0.55-1.00 deletion bin
(See Additional File 1), it means that recombination is
almost null in half of the chromosome arm. While the
recombination followed a gradient from telomere to centromere in barley, the Ae. tauschii genetic map showed
alternated low and high- recombination regions along the
short arm chromosome 3S, showing that the pattern of
recombination might be chromosome specific.
Comparative studies between wheat, barley and model
genomes such as rice and Brachypodium are helpful in
understanding the structure of grass genomes and developing strategies to overcome linkage drag, which limits
the introgression of wild genes in elite varieties [17]. As
shown in previous studies, wheat chromosome 3 is
largely collinear to rice Os1 [29,38] and to B. distachyon
Bd2 [39]. The mid-scale comparative maps presented
here revealed chromosomal rearrangements between
Brachypodium and wheat that haven't been revealed in
whole genome study [39]. Although the rice and Brachypodium genomes diverged 40-53 million years ago (Mya)
and were largely rearranged from their common ancestor
[39], the rice- and Brachypodium-Ae. tauschii co-linearity
were similar with disruption in the same distal and proximal regions of Ph2 and 2 major inversions (Figure 3).
Both inversions differentiating the 3DS physical map and

the Os1 sequence have been detected in the comparison
of the Ae. tauschii genetic map and rice and sorghum
genome sequences and their origins were assigned to the
Triticeae lineage [11], in agreement with inferences
reported here. Additional Ae. tauschii-rice/Brachypodium rearrangements probably occurred but could not be
detected in our map probably because of the low density
markers on some contigs. For example, two inversions
between rice chromosome 1 and 3BS reported in [6] were
not observed in the Ae. tauschii 3DS map due to the lack
of markers on ctgs1-2-3.
The diploid genome of barley is usually considered as a
good model for Triticeae genomics. Comparative studies

using deletion bin, cytomolecular and low-resolution
linkage maps showed a high level of synteny between
wheat and barley chromosomes and revealed very few
genomic rearrangements at the genome scale [40-43]. For
example, the comparison of barley and T. monococcum
revealed inversions and translocation between chromosomes 1H and 1A, and between chromosomes 5A and 4H
[40]. As expected, the Ae. tauschii chromosome 3DS is
largely collinear to the barley chromosome 3HS. However
we reported here a disruption of the synteny for a distal
region of 8.1 cM in barley, which has not been observed
in previous studies.

Fleury et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:382
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/382

The phylogeny of grasses suggests that the divergence
of rice and Brachypodium from Triticeae occurred about
41-47 Mya and 32-39 Mya, respectively [39,44-46]. The
structure of the orthologous Ph2 locus was almost identical in Brachypodium and rice. Although it implies that
rice and Brachypodium are closer to each other than to
wheat, DNA sequence would indicate rice and Brachypodium/Triticeae lineage split much earlier, with Brachypodium and the Triticeae splitting later as shown in [39].
The large proximal inversion of the segment 5 would have
occurred after rice and Brachypodium diverged from a
common ancestor of the Triticeae, leading to a collinear
block between barley and Ae. tauschii (Figure 3).
The complexity of the rearrangements inside segment 5
between rice/Brachypodium and Ae. tauschii showed that
the large inversion might actually be a series of inversions
nested in each other. It might correspond to larger rearrangements between the adjacent bins 3S-0.57-0.78 and
3S-0.45-0.55 and rice chromosome 1 observed in the EST
group 3 chromosome bin map [29]. Other inversion
events have occurred in the distal region of Ph2 leading to
different rearrangements of the rice/Brachypodium-barley-Ae. tauschii synteny. The disruption of co-linearity
between wheat and barley showed that inversions would
have occurred after the separation between Hordeum and
Triticum/Aegilops species about 6-16 Mya [45]. However
the inversions of segments 1 and 3 between barley and
Ae. tauschii would need to be validated by increasing the
resolution of the barley genetic map where the markers
anchored on ctg 4 and 5, and ctg 6 and 7 co-segregated
respectively at 8.2 cM and 12.5 cM.

Conclusions
The construction of physical maps for a 5 Gb size genome
is a complex and laborious task. Although the map
reported here is only for a portion of the wheat genome, it
is nevertheless the first report using fingerprinting of a
complete Triticeae genome. It provided significant data
showing chromosomal rearrangements between wheat,
Brachypodium and barley, and it will be a useful resource
for gene cloning of chromosome 3D. Whether or not the
composition of Triticeae genomes with 90% of repeat
DNA sequence [47] precludes the assembly of BAC contigs from whole-genome BAC libraries, this study showed
that global fingerprinting of the large Triticeae genomes
is capable of generating such physical maps despite the
complexity of and high repeated sequence content in
these genomes. This strategy is now used by the International Barley Sequencing Consortium which will soon
release a physical map of barley [48].
Methods
Probe design and BAC filter hybridization

Plant material (Triticum aestivum cv Chinese Spring and
nullisomic-tetrasomic derivatives) and the DNA extrac-

Page 8 of 10

tion were respectively described in [13] and [49]. The
BAC libraries and assembly of Ae. tauschii AL8/78 are
described in [10] and http://wheatdb.ucdavis.edu.
The primers were designed to amplify unique 150-400
bp fragments of unigenes defined in the DFCI wheat gene
index v11 http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi by using
Primer 3 program (See Additional File 3). The PCR reaction was carried out in 20 μl final volume with 400 nM of
both primers, 200 μM of each dNTP, 1.5 mM of MgCl2,
0.5 U Taq Platinum polymerase (Invitrogen) with its 1×
buffer and 40 ng of DNA. The PCR amplification followed a touch-down procedure: 1 cycle 2 min at 94°C, 10
cycles (20 sec 95°C, 20 sec Tm minus 0.5°C each cycle, 2
min 72°C), 35 cycles (20 sec 95°C, 20 sec Tm minus 5°C, 2
min 72°C) and an additional extension step of 10 min at
72°C (See Additional File 3). Probes were purified by
cleaning up the PCR product or by electrophoresis on
agarose gel using the MinElute kit (Qiagen) and verified
by Sanger's method sequencing prior hybridization. We
used the ABI PRISM® BigDye™ Terminators V 3.1 for the
sequencing reaction according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The southern blot analyses onto membranes
of restricted DNA from nullisomic-tetrasomic lines and
onto Ae. tauschii BAC filters were performed according
to [49] by pooling up to 8 probes. The positive BAC
clones were cultivated in 96-well plates overnight in 200
μl of LB medium supplemented with 15 mg/l tetracycline
for the BB and HB clones and with 15 mg/l chloramphenicol for HD, HI and RI clones. The cultures were centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 rpm, and then the supernatant
was replaced by MilliQ water. The anchoring of the markers on the positive BAC clones was validated by direct
PCR with 1 μl of bacterial solution.
Re- assembly of the BAC from targeted region

To minimize false assembly caused by genome-wide network, a subset of BAC clones including all clones of original contigs which contain positive clone(s) and singletons
were re-assembled into contigs by using the FPC program
[50,51]. The contig number(s) used were results of the reassembly.
Genetic mapping and recombination rate

For map alignments, wheat unigenes and markers
sequences were compared to the 8× B. distachyon
genome sequence http://www.brachypodium.org and to
the rice pseudomolecules of Rice Genome Annotation
Project - MSU Rice Genome Annotation (Osa1) Release
6.0 using BLASTN and TBLASTX. The homologues were
assigned based on the best match to the rice pseudomolecules with significant threshold for the expectation E
value of e-10. The same wheat sequences were used to
identify the barley homologous unigenes of HarvEST:Barley (v1.76) assembly #35 by using BLASTN. The
best matches were selected with a cut-off E value of e-20.
