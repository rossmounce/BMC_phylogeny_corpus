Abstract
Background: The transmission of HIV-1 drug-resistant strains in drug naive patients may seriously
compromise the efficacy of a first-line antiretroviral treatment. To better define this problem, a
study in a cohort of newly diagnosed HIV-1 infected individuals has been conducted. This study is
aimed to assess the prevalence and the patterns of the mutations recently associated with
transmitted drug resistance in the reverse transcriptase (RT) and in protease (PR) of HIV-1.
Methods: Prevalence of transmitted drug resistant strains is determined in 255 newly diagnosed
HIV-1 infected patients enrolled in different counselling and testing (CT) centres in Central Italy;
the Avidity Index (AI) on the first available serum sample is also used to estimate time since
infection. Logistic regression models are used to determine factors associated with infection by
drug resistant HIV-1 strains.
Results: The prevalence of HIV-1 strains with at least one major drug resistance mutation is 5.9%
(15/255); moreover, 3.9% (10/255) of patients is infected with HIV nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitor (NRTI)-resistant viruses, 3.5% (9/255) with HIV non-NRTI-resistant viruses and 0.4% (1/
255) with HIV protease inhibitor (PI)-resistant viruses. Most importantly, almost half (60.0%) of
patients carries HIV-1 resistant strains with more than one major drug resistance mutation. In
addition, patients who had acquired HIV through homosexual intercourses are more likely to
harbour a virus with at least one primary resistance mutation (OR 7.7; 95% CI: 1.7–35.0, P = 0.008).

Conclusion: The prevalence of drug resistant HIV-1 strains among newly diagnosed individuals in
Central Italy is consistent with the data from other European countries. Nevertheless, the presence
of drug-resistance HIV-1 mutations in complex patterns highlights an additional potential risk for
public health and strongly supports the extension of wide genotyping to newly diagnosed HIV-1
infected patients.

Background
The development of resistance to the currently available
antiretroviral drugs against HIV-1 infection is one of the
major limitations to the maintenance of a successful treatment. Its frequent detection among HIV-infected treatment failing patients [1-3] can in turn increase the risk of
new infections driven by drug-resistant viral strains [4].
This can carry important clinical implications. Indeed,
once transmitted, a drug-resistant virus can persist for
months to years without reversion to wild-type [5]. In
addition, the presence of drug-resistant HIV-1 strains in
drug naïve patients is associated with an increased probability of virological failure to the first-line antiretroviral
therapy [6-8]. For these reasons, the new guidelines recommend to perform the genotypic resistance testing in all
drug naive patients, before beginning a first line antiretroviral regimen [9,10].
To date, there is a growing literature about the rate of
transmission of HIV-1 drug-resistant virus. In the United
States and in Europe, where there is a wide access to highly
active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the prevalence of
HIV-1 drug-resistant strains ranges between 3.3% and
14.0% in recently infected patients and between 6.1% and
12.5% in chronically infected ones [11-16].
The estimation of the rates within the patterns of transmitted drug resistance mutations is crucial for surveillance
programmes and for providing feedback on the efficacy of
HIV-1 prevention strategies.
To better define the size of the phenomenon, we led a
study in a cohort of newly diagnosed HIV-1 infected
patients in Central Italy aimed at defining i) the prevalence of the classical as well as of the novel mutations
recently associated with resistance to RT and PR inhibitors
(and their correlation with viral-immunological parameters), ii) the clusters of drug resistance mutations and iii)
the circulation of HIV-1 subtypes and putative recombinant forms (CRFs).

Methods
Study population
The study included 263 HIV-1 infected individuals
enrolled between January 2004 and March 2007 in the
SENDIH (Studio Epidemiologico Nuove Diagnosi Infezione HIV-1) programme, a multicenter study aimed to col-

lect behavioural, virological and molecular data on
persons with newly diagnosed HIV infection. Characteristics and methods of the study have been previously
described elsewhere [17]. Individuals with a first HIV-1
positive test performed in 10 public Counselling and Testing centres (CTC) in Lazio Region, Italy, were invited to
participate in the study. At the diagnosis, clinical and
immunologic data, and blood sample have been collected
from all participants to investigate the molecular characterization of the virus and to identify recently acquired
infections.
Informed consent was obtained from participants and the
ethics committee of the National Institute for Infectious
Diseases L. Spallanzani, Rome approved the study. All of
the information gathered during the study was analyzed
in a completely anonymous way.
The IgG avidity assay
To estimate time since infection, we calculated the Avidity
Index (AI) on the first available serum sample, using an
automated anti-HIV enzyme immunoassay (EIA), as previously described [18-20]. The method is based on the
rationale that antibodies produced in the early phase of
an infection show a low avidity for the antigen, and the
antibody avidity increases progressively with the time
after exposure to an immunogen. Thus, a low avidity is
likely to indicate a recent infection. In particular, an AI <
0.80 has been reported to fairly define an infection
acquired in the 6 months prior the diagnosis (recent infection) while AI ≥ 0.80 is generally used in literature to
define long-standing infection [18-20]. Misclassifications
of recent infections as long-standing infections (and vice
versa) could not be excluded for patients with an AI index
between 0.80 and 0.90 [18].
HIV sequencing
HIV genotype analysis was performed on plasma samples
by means of a commercially available kit (ViroSeq HIV-1
genotyping system; Abbott Laboratories) [21]. The
polymerase chain reaction was performed in all the 263
samples and was successful for 255 samples (yeld 97%),
that were then sequenced (yeld of 97%). Briefly, RNA was
extracted, retrotranscribed by murine leukemia virus
reverse transcriptase (RT), and amplified with AmplitaqGold polymerase enzyme by using two different
sequence-specific primers for 40 cycles. Pol-amplified

products (containing the entire protease and the first 335
amino acids of the reverse transcriptase open reading
frame, 1302 nt) were full-length sequenced in sense and
antisense orientations by an automated sequencer (ABI
3100) by using seven different overlapping sequence-specific primers [21]. Sequences having a mixture of wildtype and mutant residues at single positions were considered to have the mutant(s) at that position.
Phylogenetic analysis
All 255 HIV-1, sequences (1302 nt) were aligned and
compared with reference sequences for the Major HIV-1
subtypes, available at: http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/
sequence/NEWALIGN/align.html using CLUSTAL X [22].
The sequences were then manually edited with the Bioedit
program [23], and gaps were removed from the final
alignment. All sequences were analyzed using the REGA
HIV-1 subtyping tool. [24]

Separate trees were then generated using F84 Model of
substitution with both NJ and Maximum Likelihood (ML)
tree building methods [25], for both non-B pure subtypes
and putative recombinant forms.
Phylogenetic trees were performed with different evolutionary model according to the Hierarchical Likelihood
Ratio Test (HLRT) implemented in the Model Test V3.0
software [26]. The statistical robustness within each phylogenetic tree was confirmed with a bootstrap analysis
using 1000 replicates for the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree.
All calculations were performed with PAUP*4.0 software
[25].
Simplot software version 3.2 [27] was used to generate
similarity plots and bootscan plots, for genetic diversity
and intersubtype recombination analysis.
Determination of drug resistance mutations
To estimate the prevalence of resistant strains, we used the
list of drug resistance mutations associated with transmitted drug resistance, that is reported by Shafer et al., 2007
[28]. This list is used in all the epidemiological and surveillance studies addressing the transmission of HIV drugresistance in drug naïve patients: in the RT, M41L, K65R,
D67N/G, D67del, T69D, T69ins, K70R, L74V, V75A/M/T/
S, F77L, L100I, K101E, K103N/S, V106A/M, Y115F,
F116Y, Q151M, Y181C/I, M184V/I, Y188C/H/L, G190A/
E/S/Q, L210W, T215C/D/E/F/I/S/Y/V, K219E/Q/R,
P225H, M230L, P236L; in the PR, L24I, D30N, V32I,
M46I, I47A/V, G48V, I50L/V, F53L, I54A/L/M/S/T/V,
G73A/C/S/T, V82A/F/M/T/S, I84A/C/V, N88D/S, L90M
[28,29].

We also determined the prevalence of the RT polymorphism V60I that has been associated with the persistence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/111

of tymidine analogues mutations 1 (TAMs1) in drug naïve
patients [30].
Other polymorphisms at positions already associated
with drug resistance were also investigated.
Statistical analysis
(i) Quantitative measurements and mutation prevalence
For quantitative measurements, data sets with non-normal distributions were compared non-parametrically
using Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical data were analyzed by using Fisher exact test. A p value less than 0.05
was used to determine statistical significance. Logistic
regression analysis was used to examine the association
between epidemiological, clinical and virological factors.
(ii) Mutation covariation
We calculated the binomial correlation coefficient (phi)
for all the possible pairwise combinations between all
mutations related with drug resistance. The covariation
analysis was performed in the 213 HIV-1 B subtype
infected patients.

All calculations were performed using a script implemented in the R software, version 2.7.1 http://www.rproject.org.
Statistically significant pairwise correlations were those
with a P value < 0.05. For each pair, two positions each
with a mixture of two or more mutations were excluded
from the covariation analysis, since it is impossible to discriminate whether these mutations fall in the same viral
genome. We used the Benjamini-Hochberg method to
identify pairwise combinations that were significant in the
presence of multiple-hypothesis testing; a false discovery
rate of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.
In order to analyze the covariation structure of mutations
in more detail, we performed mutational clusters, defined
as clusters of three or more mutated positions in which
each position was significantly correlated with each other,
identified by a computational technique that evaluated all
possible clusters that can be formed from the significant
correlated pairwise combinations of mutated positions
[31].

a Among

255 patients, epidemiological information was available for 249 patients. The 6 patients without epidemiological information are included in
the group of 240 patients carried wild type virus. Thus, the percentages were calculated on 249 patients in the second column and on 234 patients
on the forth column.

South America (41.0%), 17 from Sub-Saharan Africa
(27.9%), 14 from Eastern Europe (23.0%) and 5 from
North and Central America (8.2%).
Based on results of Avidity Index, 58 (22.7%) patients
were classified as recent infected, while the remaining 197
(77.2%) were classified as long-standing infected patients.
At the time of median diagnosis, CD4 cell count was
higher in individuals with a recent infection compared to
those with a long-standing infection (480 [interquartile
range, IQR: 366–655] cell/mm3 vs 330 [IQR: 146–484]
cell/mm3, P < 0.001, data not shown) while median
viremia was not significantly different in the two groups
of patients (4.8 [IQR: 4.0–5.4] log10 HIV-1 RNA copies/
ml vs 4.9 [IQR: 4.4–5.4] log10 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml, P =
0.09). A major proportion of Italian patients was found in
the group of recently HIV-1 infected patients than in the
long-standing infected one (49 [87.5%] vs 139 [72.0%], P
= 0.02, data not shown).

Several factors that might affect the risk of becoming
infected with drug-resistant virus were explored (Table 1).
Patients who had acquired HIV through homosexual
intercourses were more likely to harbour a virus with at
least one primary resistance mutation (OR 7.7; 95% CI:
1.7–35.0, P = 0.008). In particular, homosexuals had a
significant increased risk of harbouring HIV with resistance mutations to NRTI (OR 9.5, 95% CI: 1.2–76.6, P =
0.03), while risk of resistance mutations to NNRTI and PI
was not significantly associated with HIV risk factor (P =
NS). This may reflect the higher and earlier access to treatment of this class than other groups of patients.
Circulation of HIV-1 subtypes in newly diagnosed patients
in Italy
The figures 1 and 2 represent the 22 non-B pure subtypes
and the 20 putative recombinant forms circulating in
Italy.

Phylogenetic analysis showed that B subtype was the most
predominant in the overall population (213 [83.5%]),
followed by C subtype and CRF02_AG (10/255 [3.92%]
each one). Regarding the country of origin, the majority of
patients infected by B subtype was Italian (170 [79.8%]).
Among the 42 individuals infected with a non-B subtype,
18 (42.9%) were Italian, 7 (16.7%) were from a European
country, and 17 (40.5%) were from outside Europe. The
prevalence of C and A subtypes was higher in non-Italian
compared to Italian patients (7 [11.4%] vs 3 [1.6%], P =
0.003, and 3 vs 0 [0.0%], P = 0.01). Thus, nearly half of
patients infected with a non-B subtypes were Italian.
Interestingly, we also observed the presence of CRF03_AB
in one recently and in one long-standing infected patients,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/111

coming from Italy and Eastern Europe, respectively. This
is the first study that reports the circulation of CRF03_AB
in Italy (Figure 2).
Prevalence of major mutations associated with drug
resistance
Among the 255 newly diagnosed, 15 (5.9%) carried HIV1 strains with at least 1 major mutation associated with
transmitted drug resistance (Table 2) [28,29]; all of them
were infected with subtype B.

Of note, 9/15 (60.0%) of these patients carried HIV-1
strains with two or more mutations associated with transmitted drug resistance. Five out of 9 patients (55.5%) were

resistant to 2 drug classes (all with HIV-1 B subtype).
Among these 5 patients, 4 (80.0%) were resistant to
both nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)
and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
(NNRTIs), and 1 (20.0%) to NRTIs and protease inhibitors (PIs). None carried resistance to all 3 drug classes.
Major mutations associated with NRTI resistance were
observed in 10 (3.9%) patients (Table 2). The revertant
mutations at codon 215 were the most frequently
observed (8 [3.1%]), followed by L210W (6 [2.3%])
(Table 2). Among the 8 patients with the revertant forms

of T215Y/F, 5 had T215D (resulting from a single nucleotide substitution of TAC/TAT [Y] to GAC/GAT [D]), 2
had T215S (resulting from a single nucleotide substitution of either TAT/C [Y] or TTT/C [F] to TCT/TCC [S]) and
1 had a mixture of T215D/S/Y. The only TAM2 observed
was D67N, found in one patient together with the TAM-1
M41L, L210W and T215Y. Similarly the 3TC-selected
mutation M184V was found in only one patient (together
with L210W). Thus, the majority of NRTI resistance is sustained by TAM-1 (comprising the T215Y revertant forms),
suggesting that such mutational pattern confers a fitness
level greater than TAM-2.

Among 9 patients (3.5%) carrying NNRTI-resistance
mutations, 7 had K103N (conferring high level of resistance to both nevirapine and efavirenz) (Table 2). This
mutation was found together with L100I and P225H in
two and one patient, respectively; both mutations are
known to occur almost exclusively with K103N in patients
failing an antiretroviral regimen containing efavirenz
[32].

diagnosed HIV-1 infected patients
i) Correlated pair of mutations
A covariation analysis was performed in order to determine significant patterns of pairwise correlation between
drug resistance mutations in drug-naïve patients (Table

3). The most strongly correlated pairs of major mutations
in drug naïve patients are as follows: L210W+M41L (phi
= 0.6) found in 3 patients, L210W+T215D (phi = 0.9) and
L210W+K103N (phi = 0.4) found in 5 and 3 patients,
respectively. The T215D was also strongly correlated with
V60I (phi = 0.31, P = 0.02), a common polymorphism
that is known to rescue the replicative capacity impaired
by the TAM1 mutations in the absence of drug pressure
[30].
ii) Clusters of mutations
The topology of the dendrogram (Figure 3) shows the
existence of one significant (bootstrap > 0.75) cluster of
major mutations in newly diagnosed HIV-1 B subtype
infected patients. In particular, the cluster involved four

Discussion
Our study shows that the prevalence of HIV-1 drug-resistant strains in newly diagnosed patients is 5.9%, in the
range described by other European and American reports
[11-16], and that the majority (60.0%) of these HIV-1
strains carries more than one major drug resistance mutation.
The prevalence of major drug resistance mutations is nonsignificantly different in recent infections compared to
long-standing infections (3.4% versus 6.6%); if something, a trend toward a decreased rate of resistance was
found in recent infections (P = 0.09), that may reflect the
increasing use of potent drugs and highly active antiretroviral regimens in recent years. At the same time, this supports the analysis of Blower that has estimated a
progressive decrease in the proportion of acquired resistance from 1996 to 2005 [33]. These data suggest that the
phenomenon of extensive and continuously increasing
transmission of resistant strains followed by their disappearance from blood (while remaining in reservoir) is not
as widespread as previously foreseen.
In addition, we found that the prevalence of mutations
associated with transmitted drug resistance was higher in
MSM than in heterosexual patients, in line with other
European and American reports [16,34]; this factor could
be related with the higher and earlier access to treatment
of this class than other groups of patients.
Among major drug resistance mutations, the most common mutations observed were the NNRTI resistance
mutation K103N and the NRTI T215 revertants (3.1%
each one). Interestingly, the first one, K103N, was known
to confer high level of resistance to nevirapine and efavirenz (without altering the viral replicative capacity), but

not to the recently approved etravirine [35]. The presence
of the T215 revertants suggests a previous infection with a
HIV-1 strains containing T215Y/F [36,37], and has been
associated with an increased risk of virologic failure in
patients receiving a first line regimen with thymidine analogue [38].
We also found that about 60% of our patients harbours
HIV-1 strains with more than one major drug resistance
mutation. In addition, by performing a cluster analysis,
we observed, in our cohort of newly diagnosed HIV-1 B
subtype infected patients, the existence of a complex
mutational cluster involving the revertant forms T215D/S
and the TAM1 M41L, L210W (known to confer crossresistance to all NRTIs), the K103N (known to confer
cross-resistance to EFV and NVP) and the polymorphism
V60I. This mutation has been shown to rescue the replicative capacity impaired by the major drug resistance mutations in the absence of drug pressure, and to contribute to
the persistence over time of major drug resistance mutations in drug naïve patients [30]. Consistent with this
finding, patients infected by HIV-1 strain with V60I and
TAM1 had an higher viremia than those infected by HIV1 strain with TAM1 only (5.30 versus 3.9 log copies/ml,
respectively, P = 0.09); however, the limited sample size
allow us to describe only a trend, that needs to be confirmed in a larger dataset.
When we performed the clustering analysis in another
cohort of 152 naïve patients from Central Italy, diagnosed
between 1997–2000, we found that major mutations
occurred alone in 10 (71.4%) of 14 patients with HIV-1
drug-resistant virus, more than 2 major mutations were
observed only in 1 patient, and no clusters have been
identified in both PR ad RT [39]. This finding is in agreement with the Spread programme [16] that showed that
71% of naïve patients with drug-resistant virus, diagnosed
for HIV-1 infection between 2002 and 2003, harboured
strains with only a single major mutation. Thus, two
important results emerge from our study: i) newly diagnosed patients carry HIV-1 strains with more drug resist-

naïve patients with NNRTI-resistance mutations (3.6% in
2004 to 0.0% in 2007). Regarding PIs, we observed that
the increasing use of PIs boosted with Ritonavir (RTV)
(from 18.4% in 2001 to 32.1% in 2004 and to 56.4% in
2007) is associated with a decrease in the percentage of
patients with PI resistance mutations (from 58.0% in
2001 to 41% in 2004 and to 28.0% in 2007). This
decreasing trend coupled with detrimental effect on viral
fitness of PI resistance mutations may explain the complete absence of transmitted PI resistance mutations
observed in our cohort of recently infected patients
(0.0%).

Regarding the subtype distribution in our study, even if B
subtype remains the prevailing one, we observed an
increase of non-B subtype and of the putative recombinant forms compared to patients diagnosed in Central
Italy before 2000 (16.5% vs 5.6%, P = 0.001 and 7.8% vs
0.6%, P = 0.001, respectively) (personal communication);
in particular, we now report for the first time the circulation of the CRF03_AB in Italy. Of note, almost half of
patients carrying non-B subtypes infected are Italian and
Caucasian, confirming a diffusion and circulation of nonB subtypes within Italian population significantly
increased when compared to the recent past.

ance mutations than that observed in previously
diagnosed patients, ii) such mutations are organized in
well defined clusters, that can seriously compromise the
success of a not sufficiently potent first line regimen.
These findings can have important clinical implications.
In particular, our results strongly support the use of genotypic test in newly diagnosed patients. This test can help
clinicians to set-up and individualize initial therapy especially in patients with extensive drug resistance. It is conceivable that in these patients the drop and long-term
maintenance of viral load below 50 copies/ml can be warranted only by using a combination of potent drugs, even
belonging to new class (as integrase inhibitors).

Conclusion

One point that is missing in most of the epidemiological
studies addressing transmitted drug resistance is the global frequency of use of antiretroviral drugs (mainly
NNRTI and PI) in treated patients. This may allow to compare more efficiently the different results obtained in the
different countries. In addition, in the attempt to better
clarify our results, we collected a cohort of 2,344 patients
failing HAART regimen between 2001–2007 in Central
Italy [40]. In this cohort, we observed that the percentage
of patients failing an NNRTI containing regimen and the
percentage of patients with NNRTI resistance mutations
remained stable from 2001 to 2004, then showed a progressive decrease from 2004 to 2007 (from 40% to 26.2%
and from 50% to 36.0%, respectively). This decreasing
trend may be in line with the decreased percentage of drug

Authors' contributions

Our cohort of newly diagnosed HIV-1 infected patients
confirms a prevalence of drug resistance mutations in line
with other reports throughout Europe. As an additional
information of potential clinical relevance, the increased
presence of drug resistance mutations, alone or in form of
complex patterns, highlights the potential risk for public
health and strongly supports the extension of wide genotyping to all patients, newly diagnosed and/or patients
that start an antiretroviral regimen.
