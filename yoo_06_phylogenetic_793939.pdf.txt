Abstract
Background: The glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)/SHAGGY-like kinases (GSKs) are nonreceptor serine/threonine protein kinases that are involved in a variety of biological processes. In
contrast to the two members of the GSK3 family in mammals, plants appear to have a much larger
set of divergent GSK genes. Plant GSKs are encoded by a multigene family; analysis of the Arabidopsis
genome revealed the existence of 10 GSK genes that fall into four major groups. Here we
characterized the structure of Arabidopsis and rice GSK genes and conducted the first broad
phylogenetic analysis of the plant GSK gene family, covering a taxonomically diverse array of algal
and land plant sequences.
Results: We found that the structure of GSK genes is generally conserved in Arabidopsis and rice,
although we documented examples of exon expansion and intron loss. Our phylogenetic analyses
of 139 sequences revealed four major clades of GSK genes that correspond to the four subgroups
initially recognized in Arabidopsis. ESTs from basal angiosperms were represented in all four major
clades; GSK homologs from the basal angiosperm Persea americana (avocado) appeared in all four
clades. Gymnosperm sequences occurred in clades I, III, and IV, and a sequence of the red alga
Porphyra was sister to all green plant sequences.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that (1) the plant-specific GSK gene lineage was established early
in the history of green plants, (2) plant GSKs began to diversify prior to the origin of extant seed
plants, (3) three of the four major clades of GSKs present in Arabidopsis and rice were established
early in the evolutionary history of extant seed plants, and (4) diversification into four major clades
(as initially reported in Arabidopsis) occurred either just prior to the origin of the angiosperms or
very early in angiosperm history.

Background
The glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)/SHAGGY-like
kinases are non-receptor serine/threonine protein kinases
that are involved in a variety of signal transduction path-

ways [1]. In animals, they are involved in cell fate determination, in metazoan pattern formation, and in
tumorigenesis [2-6]. In mammals, two enzymes, GSK3α
and GSK3β, are involved in the regulation of glycogen

metabolism [7], in stability of the cytoskeleton [8], and in
numerous processes related to oncogenesis [9]. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the GSK3 homologs MCK1 and MDS1
play a role in chromosomal segregation [10], and in
Schizosaccharomyces pombe the GSK3 homolog Skp1 regulates cytokinesis [11].
In contrast to the two members of the GSK3 family found
in mammals, plants appear to have a much larger set of
divergent GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase genes [12-28], with
functions as numerous as in animals. Genetic and biochemical approaches indicate that different plant GSKs
are involved in diverse processes, including signaling,
development, and stress response. For example, the Arabidopsis SHAGGY-like protein kinase AtGSK1 complements
the salt-sensitive phenotype of yeast calcineurin mutants
[24]. In Medicago sativa, GSK3 (WIG) is activated by
wounding [19]. Arabidopsis AtSK11 and AtSK12 participate in the regulation of flower patterning at several developmental stages [16]; both genes are expressed during
perianth and gynoecium development. Cloning of the
BIN2 (brassinosteroid-insensitive 2) locus, which is identical to UCU1 (ULTRACURVATA1) and DWF12
(DWARF12), revealed that ASKη (AtSK21) is involved in
brassinosteroid signaling [25-28]. However, in contrast to
the known functions of GSK in animals, much less is
known about the specific functions of these genes in
plants.
Plant GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinases are encoded by a multigene family [12-28];
Arabidopsis has ten different GSK genes [13,1517,20,21,23]. The protein sequences of family members
are highly conserved throughout the kinase domain. In
contrast, the N- and C-terminal regions of the plant GSK
genes are highly variable, consistent with observations
that the various plant genes are involved in divergent biological processes. However, because the functional analyses of the plant GSK genes are based on mutant
phenotypes or transcript expression levels [12-28], more
precise analyses of mutant phenotypes without the Nand/or C-terminal regions are needed to determine
whether the variable N- and C-terminal regions are related
to the functional differences of plant GSK genes. Based on
phylogenetic analyses of amino acid and cDNA
sequences, Arabidopsis GSK genes have been grouped into
four classes (I-IV) [13,15-17,21].
Besides Arabidopsis GSKs, GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase genes
have been reported from the angiosperms Oryza sativa,
Brassica napus, Medicago sativa, Petunia hybrida, Nicotiana
tabacum,
and
Ricinus
communis
[14,15,18,19,22,23,29,30], all of which are highly derived
monocot or eudicot species. No basal eudicots or basal

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/3

angiosperm lineages, representing phylogenetically
ancient groups, were included in any previous analyses.
Furthermore, no phylogenetic analyses of plant GSK genes
have included sequences from diverse green plant lineages. Thus, it is not clear when plant-specific GSK3/
SHAGGY-like kinases diverged or what complement of
GSK genes is present in basal angiosperms or indeed other
land plants. Recently, the Floral Genome Project (FGP)
research consortium [31] provided expressed sequence tag
(EST) sequences of GSK genes for a number of basal
angiosperms, including Amborella trichopoda and the water
lily Nuphar advena [32]. These taxa are phylogenetically
important because they represent the earliest-diverging
lineages of extant flowering plants [e.g., [33-42]].
In this study we examined the diversification of the GSK3/
SHAGGY-like kinase genes in plants. Specifically, we (1)
compared the structure of GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase
genes in Arabidopsis and rice, and (2) addressed whether
the diversity of GSK genes in Arabidopsis is unique to Arabidopsis or is more generally true of all angiosperms and all
land plants. For example, if the diversification of the gene
family predated or coincided with the origin of the
angiosperms, then ESTs from basal angiosperm taxa
should appear in all major clades identified in Arabidopsis.
Likewise, if GSK gene diversity in plants is ancient, basal
lineages of land plants, such as mosses, should also contain orthologs to the Arabidopsis genes. Alternatively, some
gene lineages may have diversified since the origin of the
angiosperms, or land plants, and will not contain
sequences from all basal lineages.

Results and discussion
Gene structure and patterns of sequence evolution
The structure of five Arabidopsis GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase
genes was reported by Dornelas et al. [15]. We sought to
obtain a more comprehensive view of the structure of
these genes. To accomplish this, we used the complete
genome sequences now available for Arabidopsis and rice
[43,44]; we describe the gene structure of additional GSKs
from Arabidopsis, as well as the structure of GSKs reported
from rice. We followed the numbering scheme of Dornelas et al. [15] for numbering exons and introns.

The structure of GSK genes in Arabidopsis and rice is highly
conserved (Figure 1). This conservation of gene structure
is also apparent by inspection of the aligned sequences
across a diverse array of plants, including angiosperms,
gymnosperms, a fern, a moss, and green and red algae
[45].
Most of the GSK genes have 12 exons interrupted by 11
introns, but there are some exceptions. AtSK12 does not
contain intron 6, and AtSK21 does not possess introns 3
and 11. As a result, these two genes have the smallest

Os10g37740, which either lack an intron or an exon or have additional exons. Open triangles indicate the absence of an intron.

number of exons among the GSKs we examined. In addition, AtSK31 and AtSK32 have one additional exon
(located between exons 1 and 2) compared to most other
members of the GSK gene family. In our phylogenetic
analyses, these two genes from Arabidopsis appear together
in a clade with a sequence from Oryza (Os10g37740),
which also has one additional exon similarly located
between exons 1 and 2. These results suggest that the presence of this additional exon in Arabidopsis and rice was
inherited from a common ancestor, prior to the divergence of monocots and eudicots, suggesting that the addition of this exon was an ancient event that occurred early
in the diversification of flowering plants or possibly prior
to the origin of flowering plants. It would be interesting to

determine whether other sequences from clade III (see
phylogenetic results below) similarly have an extra exon.
Tichtinsky et al. [23] reported that PSK6.2 and PSK7 from
Petunia hybrida also have an additional exon between
exons 1 and 2. However, genomic sequences are not available for other members of clade III. Recent studies demonstrate that the structure of three GSK genes from the
moss Physcomitrella patens is very similar to that of Arabidopsis and rice [46].
The structurally variable 5' region of plant GSKs is composed of exons 1 and 2, and the catalytic domain is
encoded by exons 3–10 [47]. The structurally variable 3'
region typically comprises exons 11 and 12 (Figure 1).

The length of the GSK genes in Arabidopsis ranges from
2135 bp (AtSK12) to 3558 bp (AtSK22), whereas the
length ranges from 2341 bp (Os05g04340) to 6186 bp
(Os06g35530) in rice. The large variation of gene length in
rice is due to the presence of long introns (up to 2173 bp
in Os06g35530) in some genes.

regions are spread across the protein, but the most highly
variable regions occur at amino acid positions 121–124
and 317–320 (Figure 3). The latter region (corresponding
to the variable region of exon 12) accumulated 147 amino
acid substitutions over an 8-aa interval, in a region that
underwent 325 nucleotide substitutions. This high ratio
of amino acid to nucleotide substitutions implies that
many amino acid substitutions are tolerated in the 3'
region outside of the catalytic domain (Figure 3). In contrast, amino acid positions 29–32, 37–44, and 161–180
were conserved, although these regions were not conserved at the nucleotide level, suggesting that selection
and/or functional constraints may be important in this
part of the protein.

Sequence analyses
We investigated the patterns of nucleotide substitution
across 116 plant-specific GSK homologs. This comparison
provides a minimum estimate of change in a 4-position
window. The substitution pattern of plant GSK homologs
varied across the nucleotide sequences (Figure 2). The
most variable 4-nucleotide window occurs at positions
945–948, with 70 substitutions in this interval. The substitution pattern of plant-specific GSK homologs when
analyzed across amino acid sequences revealed a pattern
similar to that found for nucleotide sequences. Variable

Changes at the first, second, and third codon positions
varied substantially. Substitutions in third positions were
much more frequent than those at first and second posi-

tions (Figure 4). The ratio of base substitutions by codon
position is 2.0: 1.0: 7.6. A similar pattern was observed in
each clade analyzed: green plants, mosses, clade I, II, III,
and IV. Substitutions also vary similarly among organismal groups, regardless of gene clade, for example, among
all angiosperm sequences and among all monocot
sequences (Figure 4). This result implies a similar pattern
of base substitution in diverse gene lineages and organismal lineages.
Phylogeny of GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase genes
A total of 842 variable sites was found in the nucleotide
sequences, 735 of which were parsimony-informative.
Seventeen most parsimonious trees with a length of
11641 steps were obtained from the maximum parsimony (MP) analysis. The consistency index (CI) was
0.1522, and the retention index (RI) was 0.5789. In the
amino acid analysis, 288 variable sites were detected, with

234 parsimony-informative; 77 most parsimonious trees
of 2156 steps were obtained (CI = 0.4935; RI = 0.7532).
The clades identified in the support-weighted tree based
on nucleotide sequences (SW; Figure 5) are very similar to
those of the maximum parsimony tree based on the same
data set (MP-N; Figure 6), although relationships among
basal nodes are not resolved in the support-weighted tree.
Furthermore, the clades found in the trees based on nucleotide sequences (both MP and SW) are very similar to
those found in the MP trees based on translated amino
acid sequences (MP-AA; Figure 7). Therefore, AT content,
codon usage, and other molecular evolutionary biases do
not appear to have compromised the reliability of the
nucleotide-based results. In fact, the nucleotide data are
more informative than the amino acid sequences, yielding
greater support for most clades (see Figures 5, 6, 7). However, support for most clades is quite low in all analyses.

Figure 4
Mean number of inferred nucleotide substitutions by codon position based on the comparison of 139 GSK homologs
Mean number of inferred nucleotide substitutions by codon position based on the comparison of 139 GSK homologs. Subsets
of the full data set are based on the results of the phylogenetic analysis of GSKs (green plants, moss, clade I, clade II, clade III,
clade IV) or represent well-recognized organismal groups (angiosperms, monocots).

The clades found in the Bayesian phylogenetic analysis
based on nucleotide sequences are almost identical to
those of the maximum parsimony tree based on the same
data set. Therefore, the posterior probabilities are indicated on the maximum parsimony strict consensus tree
(MP-N) (Figure 6).
In all four phylogenetic analyses, all of the land plant GSK
sequences formed a clade distinct from non-plant
sequences with high values of internal support as measured by bootstrap, posterior probabilities, and jackknife
resamplings (Figures 5, 6, 7). In all four analyses, the Porphyra sequence is sister to all green plant sequences (0.97
posterior probability, support values of 59%, <50%, and
82% from parsimony jackknifing mapped onto the SW
tree, MP-N, and MP-AA, respectively), and the
Chlamydomonas sequence is sister to all other green plant
GSKs (0.99 posterior probability, support values of 81%,
75%, and 64% from parsimony jackknifing mapped onto
the SW tree, MP-N, and MP-AA, respectively).
The trees from all four analyses recovered five major
clades of sequences within land plants. One clade is composed only of sequences from the moss Physcomitrella (1.0
posterior probability, support values of 100%, 99%, and
72% from parsimony jackknifing mapped onto the SW
tree, MP-N, and MP-AA, respectively), and the remaining

four clades (I, II, III, and IV) correspond to the GSK subgroups recognized in Arabidopsis [13,15-17,21]. Relationships among these five clades varied among the analyses,
but internal support was weak except in the Bayesian analysis. A large clade containing clades I, II, and III received a
posterior probability of 0.90, and a clade including clades
I and II had a posterior probability of 1.0 (Figure 6).
The MP-N tree (Figure 6) shows the moss clade as sister to
the remaining four clades, whereas the MP-AA tree places
the moss clade as sister to clades I, II, and III, with clade
IV sister to this entire clade of moss + clades I, II, and III
(Figure 7). The SW analysis also placed the moss clade as
sister to the remaining four clades, and clade I was split
into two separate clades (Figure 5). The fact that several
taxa bear multiple GSKs that fall into separate subclades
within clade I suggests that "clade I" may actually represent the products of an additional ancient duplication.
However, the non-monophyly of clade I in the SW tree,
lack of bootstrap support >50% in the MP trees, and the
low posterior probability in the Bayesian analysis suggest
that these two subclades may not be each other's closest
relatives.
Although we recovered four major clades that correspond
to the four groups recognized in Arabidopsis by Dornelas et
al. [15], relationships among and within these clades are

generally not well supported based on analyses of either
nucleotide or amino acid sequences (Figure 5, 6, 7),
apparently due to the conflict among characters. Low support was not due to the choice of outgroups. We repeated
the phylogenetic analyses using only Chlamydomonas as an
outgroup and obtained the same topology and similar
levels of support.

tionship was weakly supported (<50%) even though the
posterior probability was high (0.98). In addition, in the
SW tree, these two Pinus sequences failed to form a clade
(Figure 5). Also within clade III, one Persea EST sequence
is sister to a eudicot-specific clade that contains sequences
from Nicotiana, Petunia, Lycopersicon, Medicago, Brassica,
and Arabidopsis (AtSK31 and AtSK32).

Clade IV was supported most strongly, with 98% jackknife
support (on the SW tree; Figure 5), 1.0 posterior probability, and 81% and 78% bootstrap support from the MP-N
and MP-AA analyses. Clade III received jackknife support
of 100% (SW tree), 0.98 posterior probability, and bootstrap support less than 50% in both MP analyses. Clade II
was supported by a jackknife value of 89% (on the SW
tree; Figure 5), 0.99 posterior probability, and bootstrap
values of 85% and 72%, respectively, in the MP-N and
MP-AA analyses. Clade I received less than 50% bootstrap
support in both MP analyses and <0.90 posterior probability in the Bayesian analysis, and the SW analysis split
this clade into two parts, with jackknife values of 57% and
95%, respectively, mapped onto the SW tree (Figure 5).

Clade II contains the Arabidopsis sequences AtSK21,
AtSK22, and AtSK23. The sequences from rice, wheat, and
maize formed a clade with 77% bootstrap support in the
MP-N analysis, 1.0 posterior probability, and 100% jackknife support mapped on the SW tree; this clade was not
recovered in the MP-AA analysis. This clade also includes
sequences from the basal angiosperms Persea and Nuphar
in all trees and from Amborella in the MP-AA tree.
Sequences from the eudicots Eschscholzia, Ricinus, and
Cucumis are also included in clade II.

Oryza sequences were included in the same four major
clades with the Arabidopsis GSKs (Figures 5, 6, 7). Clade I
contains three rice sequences, Os01g19150, Os01g14860,
and Os05g04340, and clade II includes Os01g10840,
Os05g11730, Os06g35530, and Os02g14130 in all trees.
The presence of duplicate Oryza sequences within individual clades raises the possibility that some rice GSK genes
may have resulted from relatively recent gene duplication,
as reported in Arabidopsis [15]. Recently reported evidence
of genome duplication in rice [48] may explain, at least in
part, the multiple Oryza sequences within clades I and II.
Sequences of several other plant genera are found in three
of the four clades. Sequences of the grasses Triticum and
Zea are found in clades I, II, and IV, and GSKs from the
eudicots Medicago and Lycopersicon are found in clades I,
III, and IV.
Clade IV includes AtSK41 and AtSK42 from Arabidopsis,
plus sequences from other eudicots, monocots, and the
basal angiosperms Persea americana and Nuphar advena.
Nuphar advena 4 and 5 form a clade with 83% bootstrap
support, appearing well separated from Nuphar advena 3
(Figure 7). These data for Nuphar advena suggest at least
one gene duplication in clade IV and indicate a diversity
of GSK genes within some basal angiosperm species, comparable to that observed within the eudicot Arabidopsis.
Finally, Pinus taeda 2 grouped with eudicot sequences in
the MP-AA analysis (Figure 7), but in other analyses it
failed to form a subclade.
In clade III, two Pinus ESTs (Pinus taeda 3 and 4) were sister to all other sequences in both MP trees, but this rela-

Clade I contains the Arabidopsis sequences AtSK11 and
AtSK12, which formed a sister pair in all analyses (Figures
5, 6, 7); AtSK13 appeared in a separate subclade near the
base of clade I, well removed from AtSK11 and AtSK12 in
the MP-N and MP-AA trees. In the SW tree, clade I is not
monophyletic, and these sequences fall into two clades (IA and I-B), with 52% and 93% jackknife support, respectively, mapped on the SW tree. AtSK11 and AtSK12 occur
in I-A, and AtSK13 occurs in I-B (Figure 5). Expression
studies have demonstrated that both AtSK11 and AtSK12
seem to be involved in flower development [13,16]. In
contrast, AtSK13 plays a role in the response to saline
treatment and osmotic pressure. It is therefore not surprising that AtSK11 and AtSK12 are not closely related to
AtSK13, although phylogenetic position and function are
not always coupled. Clade I also contains multiple copies
of GSKs from the basal monocot Acorus, two in I-A and
one in I-B in the SW tree. The relationship between the
two sequences in I-A is not resolved, and their positions in
the two MP consensus trees did not receive bootstrap support >50%; it is therefore possible that these two
sequences are in fact sisters and represent the product of a
gene duplication within the Acorus lineage. The functions
of these divergent copies remain to be investigated.
From an evolutionary standpoint, it is significant that
ESTs from basal angiosperms were represented in all four
major clades in all analyses (Figures 5, 6, 7). ESTs of
Nuphar (Nymphaeaceae) occur in three of the four clades
(Figures 5, 6, 7). ESTs of Amborella, the sister to all other
living flowering plants (either alone or with Nymphaeales; reviewed in [49]), are found in clades I and II. ESTs
of Persea, the avocado (Lauraceae), occur in clades I, II, III,
and IV, and an EST of Liriodendron (tulip poplar; Magnoliaceae) is in clade I. ESTs of Eschscholzia (poppy; Paveraceae), a basal eudicot, are in clades I and II. Sequences

from the basal angiosperm lineages typically attach at, or
near, the base of the clades in which they appear. For
example, a sequence of Nuphar is sister to other sequences
in clade IV in the MP-AA tree. A sequence of Amborella
attaches near the base of clade I in the MP-N tree and clade
II in the MP-AA tree, and a sequence of Persea attaches very
close to the base of clades II and III in the MP-N and MPAA tree.
There is a distinct monocot subclade in both clades II and
IV, and most of the monocots form two or three subclades
in clade I. These monocot-specific subclades are particularly evident in the MP-N tree (Figure 6). Within most
clades, the eudicot sequences form a distinct subclade, for
example, the subclade of Nicotiana, Petunia, Lycopersicon,
and Medicago sequences within clade III. In clade II the
GSK homologs of the eudicots Arabidopsis and Ricinus
form a subclade. The other eudicot member of clade II,
Cucumis, does not appear with the Arabidopsis and Ricinus
sequences. However, the Cucumis sequence is a partial
sequence (only 72 amino acid residues), which could
affect its phylogenetic placement. Recently, Wiens [50,51]
reviewed the effect of missing data in phylogenetic analyses, and his simulations showed that incomplete
sequences can be accurately placed in phylogenies; furthermore, they typically do not impact the overall tree, in
agreement with empirical studies [e.g., [39,40]]. We analyzed our data set with and without the partial Cucumis
sequence, but removal of this sequence did not alter the
topology of the remaining sequences.
Sequences of GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinases are also available
for a fern and for several gymnosperms. An EST of the fern
Ceratopteris appeared within clade I, as sister to a subclade
that includes AtSK11 and AtSK12 in the MP-AA tree (Figure 7). Sequences from Zamia attached near the base of
clade I, a sequence of Welwitschia was sister to clades I, II,
and III, and the four EST sequences of Pinus taeda
appeared in clades III and IV (MP-AA), although these
positions varied in the SW and MP-N trees (Figures 5, 6).
The placement of gymnosperm sequences in clades I, III,
and IV in the MP-AA tree suggests that GSKs diversified to
some extent prior to the origin of seed plants, over 300
million years ago [e.g., [52,53]]. In addition, the presence
of a GSK sequence in Porphyra and its phylogenetic placement as sister to all green plant sequences (at least in the
two MP analyses) indicates that the plant-specific GSKs
were already established before the origin of green plants,
the oldest fossils of which are unicellular and filamentous
green algae from the Neoproterozoic of Australia (900
mya; [54,55]) and Spitzbergen (700–800 mya; [56,57];
reviewed in [52]). Taken together, our structural and phylogenetic analyses indicate that plant GSK3/shaggy-like
kinases were established prior to, or at least early in, the
diversification of green plants and that the common

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/3

ancestor of seed plants already had a diverse tool kit of
GSK3/shaggy-like kinase genes that could be used for various signaling-related processes. Future comparative studies of gene function, based on orthologous genes, may be
informative about patterns of functional diversification of
GSK genes.

Conclusion
The structure of GSK genes in Arabidopsis and rice is highly
conserved, and most GSK genes have 12 exons interrupted
by 11 introns. Genes included in the same clade based on
parsimony analyses share similar structural characteristics. Our phylogenetic results indicate that the plant-specific GSK gene lineage was established prior to, or early in,
the history of green plants, and plant GSKs began to diversify prior to the origin of extant seed plants. In addition,
at least three of the four major clades of GSKs (I, III, IV)
present in Arabidopsis and rice were established early in the
history of extant seed plants. Sequences of basal
angiosperms are present in all four of the major GSK
clades, indicating that the fourth major subgroup of these
genes (II) was established either early in angiosperm evolution or prior to the origin of the angiosperms (but after
their last common ancestor with extant gymnosperms), if
the absence of Clade II sequences from gymnosperms is
real and not an artifact of limited sampling. In addition,
our data indicate that GSK gene duplication events may
have occurred in several of the basal angiosperms investigated, most notably Nuphar. Thus, duplication of GSK
genes, which is prevalent in both Arabidopsis and rice, has
also occurred in basal angiosperms. This phylogenetic
analysis of numerous plant GSK sequences provides a
framework for the investigation of the functional genetics
of GSKs in signaling, development, and stress response.

Methods
Data retrieval
A search for GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase homologs was performed using BLAST [58,59] at the websites of NCBI [60],
TIGR [61], PlantGDB [62], Kazusa DNA Research Institute
[63], and the FGP [31]. We started our search with 10 Arabidopsis and nine rice sequences, and then continued with
various published GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase homologs
from human, yeast, Drosophila, Brassica, Medicago, Petunia,
Nicotiana, and Ricinus to identify as many GSK homologs
as possible from protists, fungi, animals, and plants. Putative GSK homology was defined initially by sequence similarity when the sequences were retrieved and then
confirmed by phylogenetic analysis (see below). A total of
139 GSK homologs was collected, of which 73 sequences
were ESTs: 26 ESTs from 10 taxa at the FGP web site, 40
ESTs from 17 taxa at the PlantGDB web site, 5 ESTs from
the NCBI web site (Ceratopteris and Pinus), and two ESTs
from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute database
(Clamydomonas and Porphyra). Some ESTs were integrated

into a contig, which was constructed using the CAP3
Sequence Assembly Program [64], and therefore some
gene designations have several accession numbers (Additional File 1). Of the remaining 66 sequences, 43 were
previously reported land plant sequences, and 23 were
sequences from protists, fungi, and animals (Additional
File 1).
Sequence alignment
All sequences were translated into amino acid sequences
using Se-Al [65]. The sequences corresponding to the catalytic domain (as defined by Hanks [47]; 285 amino acid
residues corresponding to exon 3 to exon 10 in Arabidopsis; see Figure 1) and part of the 3' region (corresponding
to 78 amino acid residues; exons 11 and 12 in Arabidopsis)
were aligned manually in a stepwise manner using Se-Al;
other regions were too variable to align. The aligned
matrix therefore comprised exons 3 to 12 and was 348
amino acid residues in length; the average length of all
included sequences was 293 amino acid residues, and the
average length of the translated EST sequences was 193
amino acid residues. The aligned sequences were exported
for phylogenetic analyses as separate data matrices of
nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences, and all
data matrices and trees were deposited in TreeBASE (Study
accession S1459, matrix accessions M2623-M2624) [45].
For Arabidopsis and rice, the genomic sequences were
aligned and compared with cDNA sequences to investigate gene structure.
Sequence analyses
A series of analyses was conducted to explore the pattern
of sequence evolution in GSK homologs. We investigated
patterns of substitution across both nucleotide and protein sequences using the CHART option of MacClade 4.05
[66], using 116 plant-specific GSK homologs and Tree 1,
selected arbitrarily from the phylogenetic analysis. This
approach provides a minimum estimate of change for
each site. Plotting of substitutions was conducted across a
4-bp or 4-amino acid interval on the x-axis. The analyses
were conducted across the entire aligned sequences. We
tested for variation in mean substitution rate among
codon positions using the CHART option of MacClade
4.05, across the entire data set, within all green plants,
within mosses, and within each of the four major clades
of seed plant sequences identified by phylogenetic analyses.
Phylogenetic analyses
Maximum parsimony analyses were conducted with (i)
equally weighted characters and character states and (ii)
support weighting [67]. Equally weighted parsimony
analyses for matrices of nucleotides and amino acids were
conducted using PAUP* 4.0b10 [68]. The search strategy
involved 100 random addition replicates with TBR branch

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/3

swapping, saving all optimal trees. Gaps were treated as
missing data. To assess support for each node, bootstrap
analyses [69] were performed using 100 replicate heuristic
searches, each with 10 random addition replicates and
TBR branch swapping, saving all optimal trees.
The support weighting method [67] provides an alternative approach to assessing internal support for phylogenetic results, by measuring the degree to which changes in
a character (site) are concentrated in the supported
branches of a tree. Jackknife resampling was used to generate randomly selected suites of initial weights for successive support weighting, providing a means of assessing the
stability of branches supported in a standard parsimony
jackknife tree [67,70]. We applied the support weighting
method to the nucleotide data matrix. Support values
mapped onto the support-weighted tree topology were
generated by standard parsimony jackknifing [70] of the
original data matrix using 1000 replicates with SPR
branch swapping on each of 10 random data entry orders.
A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed using
MrBayes 3.1.1 [71] to compare the tree topology and support values to those obtained from maximum parsimony
analyses. The GTR + I + Γ model was selected by the
Akaike information criterion (AIC) in ModelTest v.3.6
[72,73] and applied for the Bayesian analysis. Default
parameter values were used for the priors. The analysis
was run for 20 million generations, sampling trees every
1000 generations. The first 3000 trees produced during 3
million generations were discarded as burn-in, and the
50% majority-rule consensus of the remaining trees was
used to obtain posterior probabilities. Two chains were
run, and results from both chains were combined as convergence diagnostics indicated they had converged on
similar results (the average standard deviation of split frequencies at 20 million generations was 0.062054).
In previous phylogenetic analyses [13], mitogen activated
protein kinase (MAPK) and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)
sequences were shown to be the sister group to a clade of
all GSK homologs. We analyzed plant MAPK/CDK/Casein
kinase II/GSK sequences because these four kinases are
included in the same group [74]. In an unrooted tree, GSK
sequences formed a clade in which non-plant GSK
homologs were sister to plant GSKs (tree not shown). As a
result, we used non-plant GSKs as outgroups for analysis
of all plant-specific GSK homologs.
