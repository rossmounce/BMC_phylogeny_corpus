Phylogenomics of phosphoinositide lipid kinases:
perspectives on the evolution of second
messenger signaling and drug discovery
James R Brown1*, Kurt R Auger2

Abstract
Background: Phosphoinositide lipid kinases (PIKs) generate specific phosphorylated variants of phosatidylinositols
(PtdIns) that are critical for second messenger signaling and cellular membrane remodeling. Mammals have 19 PIK
isoforms spread across three major families: the PtIns 3-kinases (PI3Ks), PtdIns 4-kinases (PI4Ks), and PtdIns-P (PIP)
kinases (PIPKs). Other eukaryotes have fewer yet varying PIK complements. PIKs are also an important, emerging
class of drug targets for many therapeutic areas including cancer, inflammatory and metabolic diseases and hostpathogen interactions. Here, we report the genomic occurrences and evolutionary relationships or phylogenomics
of all three PIK families across major eukaryotic groups and suggest potential ramifications for drug discovery.
Results: Our analyses reveal four core eukaryotic PIKs which are type III PIK4A and PIK4B, and at least one homolog
each from PI3K (possibly PIK3C3 as the ancestor) and PIP5K families. We also applied evolutionary analyses to PIK
disease ontology and drug discovery. Mutated PIK3CA are known to be oncogenic and several inhibitors are in
anti-cancer clinical trials. We found conservation of activating mutations of PIK3CA in paralogous isoforms
suggesting specific functional constraints on these residues. By mapping published compound inhibition data
(IC50s) onto a phylogeny of PI3Ks, type II PI4Ks and distantly related, MTOR, ATM, ATR and PRKDC kinases, we also
show that compound polypharmacology corresponds to kinase evolutionary relationships. Finally, we extended the
rationale for drugs targeting PIKs of malarial Plasmodium falciparum, and the parasites, Leishmania sp. and
Trypanosoma sp. by identifying those PIKs highly divergent from human homologs.
Conclusion: Our phylogenomic analysis of PIKs provides new insights into the evolution of second messenger
signaling. We postulate two waves of PIK diversification, the first in metazoans with a subsequent expansion in
cold-blooded vertebrates that was post-emergence of Deutrostomia\Chordata but prior to the appearance of
mammals. Reconstruction of the evolutionary relationships among these lipid kinases also adds to our
understanding of their roles in various diseases and assists in their development as potential drug targets.

Background
Eukaryotic signal transduction is dependent upon
various secondary messenger signaling molecules in
particular the cellular phospholipids called phosatidylinositols (PtdIns). These phospholipids activate a
spectrum of intracellular pathways that regulate multiple core functions including cellular metabolism,
cell cycle and survival, protein synthesis, cell polarity
and motility, and vesicle trafficking. Phosphorylations

around the inositol ring generates various phosphoinositides (PIs) which allow for functional specificity
in cell signaling and cellular membrane remodeling
[1]. Known PIs include PtdIns-3-phosphate (PtdIns3-P), PtdIns-4-phosphate (PtdIns-4-P), PtdIns5-phosphate (PtdIns-5-P), PtdIns-3,4-bisphosphate
(PtdIns-3,4-P 2 ), PtdIns-3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns3,5-P 2 ), PtdIns-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P 2 ), and
PtdIns-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns-3,4,5-P 3 ). Cellular
syntheses of these various PIs are regulated by certain
phosphatases and distinct families of lipid-specific
kinases called phosphoinositide lipid kinases or PIKs
(Figure 1).

Figure 1 General pathway for phosphatidylinositide (PI) synthesis. Major PI types with phosphorylation sites labeled (3,4,5 in red) are shown
along with the phophorylation and dephosphorylation reactions catalyzed by different phosphoinositide kinase (PIK) types and phosphatases,
respectively. Figure partially adapted from Figure 1 of Weernink et al. [6].

PIKs can be broadly categorized into three major protein types: PtIns 3-kinases (PI3Ks), PtdIns 4-kinases
(PI4Ks), and PtdIns-P (PIP) kinases (PIP5Ks and
PIP4Ks). PI3Ks has eight known isoforms in mammals
which are differentiated into three to four classes by
amino acid sequence homology, regulator domains and
activation cascades [2,3]. Mammals have three Class Ia
PI3Ks sharing homologous catalytic polypeptide subunits p110a (PIK3CA), p110b (PIK3CB) and p110δ
(PIK3CB). (For clarity, HUGO gene names are in parenthesis and used throughout to refer to their protein
products.) Class Ia PI3Ks are heterodimeric protein
complexes consisting of the catalytic and regulatory subunits. Class Ia kinases are multi-domain proteins having,
in order from the N-terminus, a binding domain for p85
regulatory proteins, a RAS binding domain (RBD) as
well as C2, helical (PIK) and catalytic domains. The sole

Class Ib PI3K, PIK3CG, has a distinctive p101 regulatory
domain as well as homologous, RBD, C2, helical and
p110g catalytic domains. Class II PI3Ks lack either p85
or p101 regulatory domains yet have a p110 catalytic
domain and the other domains. In humans, there are
three Class II isoforms, PIK3C2a (PIK3C2A), PIK3C2b
(PIK3C2B) and PIK3C2g (PIK3CG). Class III PI3K is
represented by a single isoform, PIK3C3 (also known
from yeast studies as vacuolar protein-sorting defective
34 or Vps34), and is the least complex PI3K kinases
having only C2, helical and catalytic domains.
There are two types of PI4Ks each comprised of two
known paralogous isoforms in vertebrates. These are
known as Type II, PI4KIIa (PI4K2A) and PI4KIIb
(PI4K2B), and Type III PI4KIIIa (PIK4CA) and PI4KIIIb
(PIK4CB) [4,5]. PI4KIIIs share sequence homology with
PI3K and together comprise the largest family of

Brown and Auger BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:4
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/4

phosphoinositide lipid kinases. PI4KII isoforms do not
share sequence homology with either PI4KIII or PI3K
kinases. The third PIK family is the phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIP5K) or PIP kinases which
lack primary sequence or structural homology to either
PI3Ks or any type of PI4Ks [6]. In mammals, there are
three types of PIP kinases or PIPKs. Type I PIP5K occurs
as three homologs known as PIP5K1-a (PIP5K1A),
PIP5K1-b (PIP5K1B) and PIP5K1-g (PIP5K1C). Type II
phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase also has three
isoforms called PIP4K2-a (PIP4K2A), PIP4K2-b
(PIP4K2B) and PIP4K2-g (PIP4K2C). Both Type I and II
PIPKs are homologs to yeast Mss4p. A third PIPK is PIKFYVE has been recently designated as PIP5K3 and
includes yeast Fab1p.
PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling is a central regulatory axis
for many key cellular functions including cell cycle, protein synthesis and glucose metabolism. Thus it is not
surprising that many diverse disease etiologies have
been associated with dysfunctional PIKs including cancer, diabetes and heart disease [7]. Phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase a peptide (PIK3CA) is highly mutated in colon,
brain and gastric cancers where apparent gain-of-function mutations confer increased activity for this lipid
kinase [8,9]. Several small molecule inhibitors of
PIK3CA are in anti-cancer clinical trials [10,11]. The
paralog PIK3C-g or PIK3CG is broadly implicated in
many diseases due to its role as a downstream signaling
component of chemokine receptors that modulate
inflammatory pathways [12]. For example, PIK3CG has
been suggested as a heart disease target because of its
roles in atherosclerosis related inflammation [13] and
pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure
[14]. Recent studies also suggest that PI4KIIIs are essential host factors utilized by the hepatitis C virus (HCV)
to remodel the intracellular matrix for virus replication
and release [15,16].
PtdIns and PIKs are evolutionary well conserved. In
fact, inositol precursors are found in bacteria and
archaea although phosphorylated derivatives are strictly
eukaryotic [17]. Homologs for all three PIKs groups
(PI3K, PI4K, and PIPK) occur across major taxonomic
clusters of eukaryotes although the number of isoforms
is highly variable with greater complexity among
metazoans, especially the vertebrates [18]. Clearly, the
emergence and diversification of PIKs second messenger
signaling is a hallmark, and potential facilitator, of
eukaryotic evolution. However, questions remain about
the antiquity of the various PIK subfamilies and the timing of the radiation and divergence of these lipid kinases
relative to the emergence of major taxonomic groups.
This knowledge is potentially relevant to biomedical
interests in PIKs such as in the interpretation and
design of model organism studies, characterization of

mutations and polymorphic variants and evaluation of
potential polypharmacology [19]. In addition, kinase
inhibitors have been suggested as novel therapeutics
against devastating eukaryotic parasitic diseases such as
malaria, caused by the Apicomplexa protists, Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax [20], as well as leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis that result from infections of
Leishmania sp., and Trypanosoma sp., respectively, both
members of the Kinetoplastids [21]. Here, we provide a
comprehensive genomic survey and phylogenetic analyses of the major types of PIKs. We show the significance of these results in understanding the evolution of
second messenger signaling as well as exploiting PIKs as
drug targets for various therapeutic areas.

Results
Phylogeny of PI3K and PI4KIII kinases

In this study, we focused on the phylogenetic analyses of
the phosphoinositide lipid kinases from representative
species across seven major taxonomic groups: the Mammalia, Vertebrata (specifically cold-blooded vertebrates),
Chordata/Deutrostomia, Protosomatia (insects/arthropods), Pseudocoelomata (nematoda worms), Viridiplantae (green plants), Fungi as well as various protists with
an emphasis on human eukaryotic parasitic groups Apicomplexa and Kinetoplastids. We retrieved amino acid
sequences from GenBank NonRedundant (nr) and species-specific databases via BLASTP [22] searches using
human PIK proteins as the initial queries (see Methods).
As necessary, sequences from other species were used as
queries to obtain further homologs. While all homologs
were initially collected, representative species for each
taxonomic major group were selected for phylogenetic
analyses on the basis of sequence completeness which
was not consistent across all genomes sequences. For
example, mammalian kinases could be consistently
represented by human (Homo sapiens), rat (Rattus norvegicus) and mouse (Mus musculus) sequences while
Chordata/Deutrostomia were represented by an aggregate of one or more homologs from the genome
sequences available for species of Deutrostomia (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, sea urchin), Tunicata (Ciona
intestinalis, tunicate) and/or Cephalochordata (Branchiostoma floridae, Florida lancelet or amphioxus). For
each of the three major PIKs families, sequences were
aligned, edited to the core conserved amino acids and
phylogenetic analyses were performed.
PI3K and PI4K type III (PI4KIII) kinases form the largest homologous group which collectively comprise of
10 distinct isoforms in vertebrates. Phylogenetic analysis
shows a distinct clustering of the different subfamilies
with high bootstrap and Bayesian posterior probability
for most clades (Figure 2). PI4KA and PI4KB (phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase catalytic a and ß, respectively) are

significantly diverged from each other as well as PI3K
subfamily proteins. Both PI4KA and PI4KB are represented throughout the major taxonomic groups as single
genes (Additional files 1 and 2).
The eight isoforms of the PI3K family have a specific
hierarchy with PIK3C3 (phosphoinositide-3-kinase, class
III) the most divergent relative to PIK3C2 (phosphoinositide-3-kinase, class II) and PIK3C (phosphoinositide3-kinase, class I) proteins. PIK3C3 occurs in all major
taxonomic groups and is the sole PI3K class protein
encoded in the genomes of plants, fungi and Apicomplexan (Plasmodium sp.). However, Kinetoplastids species have a second PI3K which appears intermediate in
homology to Class I and II kinases of metazoans.
PIK Classes Ia, Ib and II cluster together with high
bootstrap/probability values and, within each class, the
nodes clustering the various isoforms also have strong
bootstrap and Bayesian posterior probability support.
Class II kinases are specific to metazoans. Of the three
isoforms, PIK3C2G (phosphoinositide-3-kinase, class 2,
g polypeptide) is the most divergent and appears common to all species. Nematodes and arthropods are not
monophyletic, which is likely an artifact of tree reconstruction resulting from too few phylogenetically informative sites to resolve the evolutionary relationships
among these invertebrate species. PIK3C2A (a polypeptide) and PIK3C2B (b polypepetide) are both vertebrate
specific and form a strongly supported clade. Deutrostomia/Chordata species have a single PIK3C2 ortholog
which, although not entirely well resolved in the overall
PI3KC2 cluster, appears to be ancestral to both
PIK3C2A and PIK3C2B suggesting the latter two proteins evolved from a gene duplication event in early
cold-blooded vertebrates.
Similarly, Class I PI3Ks are mainly found in metazoans
with a single isoform in invertebrates. Phylogenetic analysis shows two distinct subclusters of duplicated vertebrate sequences, one of PIK3CB and PIK3CD while the
other is comprised of PIK3CA and PIK3CG. Each subcluster has a single ancestral ortholog gene which is
found in all three species representing the Deutrostomia/Chordata. Therefore, at least two further gene
duplications occurred after the emergence of true vertebrates, one lead to PIK3CB and PIK3CD while the other
resulted in PIK3CA and PIK3CG.
Phylogeny of Class II PI4K kinases

Type II PI4K kinases (PI4KII) do not share amino acid
sequence homology with either PI4KIII or PI3K kinases
(Additional files 1 and 3). Mammalians and other vertebrates have two isoforms, PI4K2A and PI4K2B (phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type 2 a and b, respectively)
which appear to have evolved from an early vertebrate
gene duplication as similarly seen for PI3K subfamilies

Page 5 of 14

(Figure 3). BLASTP database searches revealed single
copy PI4K homologs in all other species except plants
having multiple isoforms while Kinetoplastids and other
protists appear to be missing this protein. Fungal PI4KII
are basal to metazoan isoforms while plant and Apicomplexa PI4KII appear more closely related (although the
tree is unrooted). Both phylogenetic relationships are
consistent with current views on the fungal origin of
metazoans [23] and the role of secondary acquisition of
a plastid-like endosymbiont by a single-cell eukaryote
during the evolution of the Apicomplexa [24].
Phylogeny of PIP5 kinases

The PIP5K family consists of three distantly related groups
of proteins, PIP5K1 (phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate
5-kinase, type I), PIP4K2 (phosphatidylinositol-5phosphate 4-kinase, type II) and PIP5K3 (phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, type III) or PIKFYVE. In
contrast to PI3K/PI4KIII and PI4KII kinases, the relative
evolutionary relationships between these major subfamilies
are poorly resolved. Although these proteins share recognizable sequence similarity, in comparison to PI3K/PI4KIII
and PI4KII, fewer amino acids could be confidently
aligned thus reducing the phylogenetic signal. Furthermore, most eukaryotes have multiple proteins with FYVE
finger motifs that are not active kinases but rather kinase
substrates [25]. Therefore, we removed from our analysis
any proteins with low kinase domain homology (Additional files 1 and 4).
Nonetheless, all metazoan PIP5Ks were resolved into
one of the three subfamilies (Figure 4). All invertebrate
species as well as Deutrostomia/Chordata had a single
copy of PIP5K1, PIP4K2 and PIP5K3. For PIP5K1, the
three known human isoforms had orthologs in coldblooded vertebrates, again suggesting early vertebrate
specific gene duplication events. Moreover, PIP5K1A (a
peptide) and PIP5K1B (b peptide) appear to be more
similar to each other than either to PIP5K1C (g peptide)
thus might be the result of a more recent divergence
event. Similarly, all three vertebrate PIP4K2 proteins
were monophyletic with PIP4K2C (g peptide) and
PIP4K2A (a peptide) as sister groups relative to
PIP4K2B (b peptide). PIP5K3 is a single copy isoform in
all metazoans as well as fungi where the yeast prototype
is known as Fab1p. Invertebrates are depicted as paraphyletic and outside of the metazoan cluster in Figure 4.
However, both the bootstrap neighbor-joining consensus
and Bayesian trees supported the monophyly of
metazoan PIP5K3. Fungi also have a second PIP5 kinase,
the yeast ortholog Mss4p, which is more similar to
PIP5K1.
Plants have multiple, duplicated enzymes which are
most similar to PIP5K1 and PIP4K2 kinases although
phylogenetic analyses could not confidently cluster plant

kinases within either subtype. No PIP5K3 homologs
were found in plants. Kinetoplastid species have lineage
specific duplications of PIP5K1-like kinases as well as a
single PIP5K3 kinase. In contrast, Apicomplexa have a
single isoform that is most similar to PIP5K1 kinases.

The major nodes connecting plant, yeast, metazoan,
Kinetoplastid and Apicomplexa isoforms were not well
supported by bootstrap or probability values, therefore
no inference can be made about the relative order of
evolutionary emergence of the major PIPK types.

Discussion
Evolution of Second Messenger Signaling

As central components of second messenger signaling,
the evolutionary relationships of PIKs are indicative of
the emergence and divergence of this critical signaling
pathway in eukaryotes. Integration of multiple PIK phylogenies across major eukaryotic taxonomic groups permits an overview of the evolutionary stages of second
messenger signaling from unicellular protists to mammals (Figure 5). Based on their universal conservation
across eukaryotes, there is a core group of four PIKs
which are type III PIK4A and PIK4B, and at least one
homolog from PI3K (possibly PIK3C3) and PIP5K
families. PI4KII while present in metazoans, plants,
fungi and Plasmodium sp., is apparently absent from
Kinetoplastids and further searches failed to find significant homologs in the genomes of other protists such as
Trichomonas vaginalis, Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba
histolytica. Plasmodium sp. belongs to the Apicomplexa
which are believed to have evolved from the secondary
endosymbiosis of a plastid-bearing protist by a primordial eukaryotic cell [24]. Significant evidence supporting

Figure 5 Phyletic distribution of phosphoinositide kinases.
Shown is a summary of PIK orthologs and paralogs (relative to
mammals) across major eukaryotic groups. Cladogram at the top
represents relative evolutionary relationships among these groups
according to the Tree of Life web project [46].

this hypothesis are that all Apicomplexa have a nonphotosynthetic plastid organelle called the apicoplast
and many genes with plant-like origins are integrated
into their primary genome [26]. Therefore the occurrence of PI4KII in Plasmodium sp. might also be due to
the secondary acquisition from a plastid-bearing eukaryotic lineage. Another possible core PIK candidate is
PIP5K3 or PIKFYVE which is found throughout metazoans, fungi and some Kinetoplastids. However, we could
not find in plants any true PIP5K3 homologs (proteins
with a PIP5K kinase domain and FYVE motif) that
could be included confidently included our phylogenetic
analyses [25].
Among the eight known PI3K family proteins, PIK3C3
is the most likely candidate ancestral kinase of this subfamily. Two pieces of evidence in our analysis support
this hypothesis. First, single PIK3C3 orthologs are found
in all eukaryotic groups [2]. Second, phylogenetic analysis firmly establishes the early divergence of PIK3C3
from Class I and II PI3Ks. This assessment is congruent
with the early pathway catalytic function of PIK3C3 in
the generation of PtdIns-3-phosphate (PtdIns-3-P) from
a PtdIns precursor. In addition, PIK3C3 has the simplest
protein structure among all PI3K kinases insofar as it
lacks the RAS binding domains of Class Ia, Ib and II
PI3Ks as well as the p85/p110 regulatory domains of
Class Ia PI3Ks. Although only the core PIK and catalytic
domains were used for the construction of the PI3/4K
phylogenetic tree, the branching order of the three PI3K
Classes corresponds well with the general trend towards
increasing kinase complexity in terms of the number of
regulatory domains and the capability to phosphorylate
more complex PtdIns derivatives.
With the exception of some Kinetoplastid sequences,
Class I and II PI3Ks are metazoan specific proteins. Our
phylogenomic analysis suggests an evolutionary trend
where increasing organism complexity is associated with
two major waves of PIK diversification (Figure 5). First,
in early metazoans gene duplications lead to the emergence of Class I and II PIKs as well as PIP5K1 and
PIP4K2 families. This is evident from the wider repertoire of PIK isoforms in invertebrates relative to plants,
fungi and protists. The second gene expansion occurred
in early, true vertebrates. For most PIKs, a series of gene
duplications occurred in cold-blooded vertebrates after
their divergence from early urochordates but before the
emergence of mammals. Representative species of the
Deutrostomia (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus), Tunicata
(Ciona intestinalis) and Cephalochordata (Branchiostoma floridae) mostly have the same PIK complement
as arthropods and other invertebrates. Possible exceptions are the Class Ia and Class Ib PIKs where a single
corresponding ortholog for each subclass can be found
in the Deutrostomia/Chordata species. Thus the initial

Brown and Auger BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:4
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/4

diversification of Class I PI3Ks likely occurred in the
early deutrostome lineage followed by two additional
gene duplications in vertebrates resulting in contemporary complement of four Class I PIKs throughout coldblooded vertebrates and mammals.
Many different genes spanning wide functional categories have undergone major gene duplications in vertebrates and mammals. However, given the crucial role
of second messenger signaling, it is tempting to speculate that increasing multi-cellular complexity was
accompanied and, perhaps facilitated, by the evolution
of more diverse and specialized PIKs signaling
cascades.
Evolutionary Context for Cancer Mutations

The gene for phosphoinositide-3-kinase a peptide
(PIK3CA) is highly mutated in colon, brain and gastric
cancers where apparent gain-of-function mutations confer increased activity for this lipid kinase [8,9]. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that PIK3CA is most closely
related to other class Ia and Ib kinases, PI3KC-ß
(PIK3CB), PI3KC-δ (PIK3CD), and PI3KC-g (PIK3CG)
(Figure 2). Thus further knowledge about tumor-related
mutations in PIK3CA might be gained by comparing
those variants to orthologs in other species as well as
paralogs of related kinases.
Alignment of a consensus sequence of non-synonymous cancer mutations reported in the COSMIC database [27] with normal human PIK3CA as well as
orthologs from mammals and human paralogues for
PIK3CB, PIK3CD and PIK3CG are shown in Figure 6.
Several mutations occur in regions of PIK3CA which
are conserved throughout mammalian isoforms. At least
seven mutations, while non-conserved among PIK3CA
orthologs, are conservative changes matching residues in
one or more of the three other corresponding human
PIK3C paralogs. According to the COSMIC database,
one of the most frequent variants observed in cancer is
H1047R in the terminal end of the kinase domain which
has been shown to be an activating or gain-of-function
mutation. The variants H1047L and more rarely,
H0147Y, have also been recovered from clinical tumor
samples.
Gymnopoulos et al. [28] measured the oncogenic
potential of the 15 most common PIK3CA mutations
found in tumors by introducing retroviral expression
vectors with each of the variants into avian cells and
measuring their individual efficiencies for tumorigenic
transformation. Their functional assays confirmed that
the mutation H1047R strongly conferred oncogenic
potency while moderate and weak potency was induced
by the variants H1047L and H1047Y, respectively. Interestingly, PIK3CA H1047R mutation aligns with an arginine found in normal human PIK3CG while H1047L

Figure 6 Occurrence of missense cancer mutations in PIK3CA
gene relative to orthologous and paralogous PI3K kinases.
PIK3CA sequences are from human (hs_PIK3CA), mouse
(mus_PIK3CA), and dog (dog_PIK3CA) and cow (cow_PIK3CA) as
well as the human paralogs PIK3CB (hs_PIK3CB), PIK3CD
(hs_PIK3CD), and PIK3CG (hs_PIK3CG). Also included is a composite
cancer mutant human PI3KCA (hs_PI3KCAm in red) with amino acid
substitutions (mutations) mapped as reported by Samuels et al. [8]
and the Sanger COSMIC database [27]. Regions of the alignments
are shown where a cancer missense mutation is identical to an
amino acid occurring in normal human paralogs. Numbers indicate
coordinates in normal human PI3KCA. Arrows at the bottom of the
alignment point to those specific changes across paralogues. Note
for H1047, three different amino acid substitutions have been
observed and font size of label indicates the relative high (large
font) to low (small font) oncogenic potency of each type [28].
Structural domains were taken from the alignment of PI3K kinases
to the PI3K C-g structure reported by Walker et al. [47] and are not
drawn to scale.

corresponds to leucine in wild-type PIK3CB and
PIK3CD (Figure 6). H1047Y is rarely found in tumors,
appears to convey much weaker oncogenic potency than
the other two mutations and is not conserved in any
Class I PI3K paralog. The correspondence of certain
cancer mutations in PIK3CA to those found in normal
paralogs suggests that selection pressures in the tumor
might limit the range of acceptable amino acid changes.
One might speculate that these constrained amino acid
changes in a mutated PIK3CA protein could lead to
convergence in function, protein interactions or regulation with those of PIK3CB, PIK3CG or PIK3CD. Gymnopoulos and co-workers mapped H1047R/L mutations
onto a structural model of PIK3CA which suggested
that these changes are located near the hinge region of
the activation loop and could serve to increase catalytic
activity [28]. Given the importance of mutated kinases
in tumor cell viability and their increased exploitation as
cancer drug targets, better insights into delineating
between passenger and driver mutations might be
gained through broader sequence comparisons across
different species as well as related protein family members [29,30].
PIK Inhibitor Polypharmacology

Knight et al. reported inhibition data for compounds
screened across the entire PIK3C family as well as

phylogenetic tree (Figure 7). PI3KCD is the most common, potently inhibited kinase in both studies and several compounds shown high specificity such as the
compound PIK23 from Knight and co-workers [31].
Other compounds, such as PIK90 and PI103 from
Knight et al. [31] or PP102 and PP494 of Apsel et al.
[32], with high potencies across multiple PI3Ks also
inhibit one or more distantly related kinases such as
ATM, ATR, PRKDC, or MTOR. Interestingly, several
compounds show higher potency against the kinase pair
PIK3CA and PIK3CG versus PIK3CD and PIK3CB.
PIK3CA, PIK3CG and PIK3CB are considered as Class
Ia while PIK3CG is classified as Class Ib. However, the
compound inhibition profiles generally correlate with
the closer evolutionary relationships between PIK3CA
and PIK3CG kinases as shown in our trees (Figure 2
and 7).
The published compound data has some limitations
insofar that not all possible lipid kinase homologs were
assayed. For example, Apsel et al. [32] do not report
any compound assay data for PIK3C2 or PIK3C3
kinases. However, there is an overall trend for compounds with broad Class I PI3K spectrum to inhibit
other PIKs as well as more distantly related kinases.
Conversely, compounds with high potency to a subset of
Class I PI3Ks tend to be more specific. Selective polypharmacology of PIKs might be an important goal for
certain disease indications. Foukas et al. suggest that
Class Ia PI3Ks have functional redundancy in cancer

several more distantly related PI3K-like kinases such as
ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated), ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related), PRKDC (protein kinase,
DNA-activated) and MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) [31]. Their study did not include a phylogenetic
or comparative sequence analyses but rather used separate principal component analysis (PCA) plots to compare the statistical space of target similarity versus
compound-target inhibition values. More recently, the
same group published in Apsel et al. the results of several dual inhibitors of both tyrosine and PI3K and
PIK4A kinases [32]. Compounds were assayed for inhibition against all Class Ia and Ib PI3Ks, MTOR, PRKDC
and PIK4A as well as several tyrosine kinases although
not all screening panels had a complete kinase set.
Studying and predicting the target spectrum and specificity of any drug is important for determining potential polypharmacology (the modulation of multiple
targets by a single compound) as well as evaluating possible drug toxicities (due to undesirable off-target binding). In these respects, we were interested in melding
phylogenetic analyses of lipid kinases with compound
activity data to as a potential approach to complement
chemogenomics studies. We aligned the core kinase
domains of PI3Ks, PI4KIIIs, ATM, ATR, MTOR and
PRKDC (133 amino acids) and reconstructed a phylogenetic tree (Additional files 1 and 5). Selected compound
inhibition data from both studies were mapped to the
terminal branches of the respective kinase in the

Figure 7 Phylogenetic tree of PIK3/4III and related protein kinases with IC50 values from tested inhibitors. Compound names in column
are as reported by Knight et al. [31] (bold font) and Apsel et al. [32] (italics). Kinase assay are aligned with their branching order in the
phylogenetic tree. IC50 values (μM) are shaded according to potency with smaller values being more effective inhibitors of kinase activity. The
tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method as described for Figure 2 with numbers at nodes showing percent support in 1000
bootstrap replications.

cells, so inhibition of multiple isoforms might be desirable [33]. Conversely, selective inhibition of a particular
PI4KIII isoform might be necessary for developing a
well-tolerated anti-hepatitis C viral therapy [15,16].
Further molecular modeling and testing with additional
compound chemotypes might help illuminate the particular binding interactions that are involved in compound specificities.
PIKs as Anti-parasite Drug Targets

Some of the world’s most important infectious diseases
are caused by eukaryotic single-cell parasites. For example, approximately 243 million cases of malaria and
863,000 attributed deaths were reported globally in 2009
[34]. The causative agents of malaria are the Apicomplexa parasites of which Plasmodmium falciparum followed by P. vivax are the two most important infectious
agents. Globally, millions are afflicted by the diseases
Leishmaniasis (kala-azar disease) and trypanosomiasis
(Chagas disease and sleeping sickness) which result
from infections of two genera of Kinetoplastids, Leishmania sp., and Trypanosoma sp., respectively [35]. New
drugs against these parasites are urgently required
because of toxicities of existing therapies, the lack of
pediatric formulations and the emergence of drugresistant strains. The need for novel drugs is particularly
acute for malaria where there have been increasing
reports of P. falciparum strains with reduced clinical
response to the latest class of artemisinin-containing
drug combinations [36,37].
Several previous studies have suggested that kinases are
novel target opportunities for these pathogens because of
their essential roles in metabolism, signaling and pathogenesis [20,21]. In several ways, our study extends that
rationale. The lower complement of PIKs in unicellular
eukaryotes relative to metazoans suggests poor pathway
redundancy and enhanced probability of essential function
to the parasite. A recent screen of a large pharmaceutical
compound collection revealed thousands of potential leads
including compounds known to inhibit human PI3Ks [38].
The anti-plasmodial activity of these compounds might be
through direct inhibition of Plasmodium PI3K, although
blocking the human host target cannot be discounted

because the screens were performed on P. falciparum cultured in blood erythrocytes. A comparison of human and
Plasmodium kinases of the PI3K and PI4KIII types show
overall conservation of key catalytic amino acids which
suggests that screening human PIK3 compound collections might find further inhibitors of malarial kinases
(Figure 8).
As shown in our phylogenetic trees, parasite kinases
are divergent from human host homologs suggesting
potential scope for developing compounds with specificity to bind Leishmania, Trypanosoma or Plasmodium
PIKs. However, Kinetoplastids and Apicomplexa are
evolutionary distinct groups. The Apicomplexa, including Plasmodium sp., have been proposed to evolve from
an ancestor that acquired a secondary plastid through
endosymbiosis with a photosynthetic alga [24]. In contrast, comparative genomic analyses of Trypanosoma
cruzi, T. brucei and Leishmania major could not find
significant evidence supporting similar plastid invasion
into those genomes [39]. Our findings of Type II PIK4
kinases being present in plants and Apicomplexa yet
absent in Kinetoplastids, additional PI3K genes in Kinetoplastids and the overall non-clustering of these groups
in our phylogenetic trees supports the varied evolutionary history of these protists. As such, differential development of kinase inhibitors for the treatment of
malaria, leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis might need
to be considered. Malarial genes of putative plastid origins have been suggested to be potential drug targets
because of their divergence from human homologs [40].
In our analysis, the Type III PIK4CB and Type II PIK4B
proteins of Plasmodium sp. cluster with plant orthologs
with significant posterior probabilities and high bootstrap values suggesting a plant or cyanobacteria origin
for those kinases. Understanding the evolutionary relationships of Trypanosoma, Leishmania and Plasmodium
PIKs relative to each other and their human host will
further facilitate both drug target selection and the
design of counter-screen assays.

Conclusion
Phylogenomic analyses of PIKs show the progressive
complexity of second messenger signaling from

unicellular eukaryotes through metazoans and, finally,
vertebrates. Furthermore, an evolutionary perspective is
a potentially useful framework for characterizing PIKs as
drug targets in cancer and parasitic diseases as well as
providing insights into the polypharmacology of this
important group of kinases.

Methods
We reconstructed the evolutionary relationships of three
major lipid kinase families, PI3K/PI4KIII, PI4KI and PIP
kinases, from representative species across seven major
taxonomic groups Mammalia, Vertebrata (specifically
cold-blooded vertebrates), Deutrostomia/Chordata, Protosomatia (insects/arthropods), Pseudocoelomata (nematoda
worms), Viridiplantae (green plants), Fungi (yeasts and
other fungi), and human eukaryotic parasitic groups
Apicomplexa and Kinetoplastids. Protein (amino acid)
sequences were retrieved from GenBank NonRedundant
(nr) and species-specific databases via BLASTP [22]
(default settings) searches using human PIK proteins as
the initial queries. As necessary, sequences from other
species or additional paralogs were used to obtain a full
set of homologs with a cut-off of E-value ≤ 1.0e-10. Initially, large multiple sequence alignments were constructed
for all available homologs for each of the three PIK
families. Subsequently, representative species were selected
on the basis of sequence completeness. For some of the
major taxonomic groups, the genome sequence quality
was inconsistent, so multiple species were used in each of
PIK phylogenetics. For example, mammalian kinases could
be consistently represented by human (Homo sapiens), rat
(Rattus norvegicus) and mouse (Mus musculus) sequences
while Deutrostomia/Chordata were represented by an
aggregate of one or more homologs from the genome
sequences available for species of Deutrostomia (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, sea urchin), Tunicata (Ciona intestinalis, tunicate) and/or Cephalochordata (Branchiostoma
floridae, Florida lancelet).
Initial multiple sequence alignments were performed
using the program CLUSTALW v1.83 [41] with default
settings and subsequently, refined manually using the
program SEQLAB of the GCG Wisconsin Package v11.0
software package (Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA). We
removed regions with residues that could not be unambiguously aligned or that contained insertions which
resulted in edited alignments of the kinase families
(length in amino acids or aa) PI3K/PI4KIII (236 aa),
PIK4KII (269 aa), PIP (182 aa) and human PIK kinase
homologs (133 aa). These multiple sequence alignments
used in phylogenetic tree reconstructions in Figure 2, 3,
4 and 7 are included as Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
We constructed phylogenetic trees using distance
neighbor-joining (NJ) and Bayesian posterior probabilities (BP). NJ trees were based on pair wise distances

Page 12 of 14

between amino acid sequences using the programs
NEIGHBOR and PROTDIST (Dayhoff option) of the
PHYLIP 3.6 package [42]. The programs SEQBOOT and
CONSENSE were used to estimate the confidence limits
of branching points from 1000 bootstrap replications.
BP trees were constructed using the software MrBayes
v3.0B4 [43,44]. Bayesian analysis used the mixed model
of sequence evolution with random starting trees. Markov chains were run for 106 generations, burn-in values
were set for 10 4 generations, and trees sampled every
100 generations. All trees were visualized using the program TREEVIEW v1.6.6 [45].
PIK3CA mutations used to generate the composite
cancer mutant human PI3KCA sequence in Figure 6
were obtained from Samuels et al. [8] and the Sanger
COSMIC database [27]. The IC 50 s shown in Figure 7,
were obtained from published and supplementary materials provided by Knight et al. [31] and Apsel et al. [32].
For the later study, we selected to use those compounds
with PI3K inhibition IC50s which had been either shown
in Figure 2a and/or were in supplementary material with
determined PI4KA IC50s of 1.0 μM or better potencies.
