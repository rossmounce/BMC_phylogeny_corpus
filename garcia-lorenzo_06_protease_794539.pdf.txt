Abstract
Background: Proteases play key roles in plants, maintaining strict protein quality control and
degrading specific sets of proteins in response to diverse environmental and developmental
stimuli. Similarities and differences between the proteases expressed in different species may
give valuable insights into their physiological roles and evolution.
Results: We have performed a comparative analysis of protease genes in the two sequenced
dicot genomes, Arabidopsis thaliana and Populus trichocarpa by using genes coding for proteases
in the MEROPS database [1] for Arabidopsis to identify homologous sequences in Populus. A
multigene-based phylogenetic analysis was performed. Most protease families were found to
be larger in Populus than in Arabidopsis, reflecting recent genome duplication. Detailed studies
on e.g. the DegP, Clp, FtsH, Lon, rhomboid and papain-Like protease families showed the
pattern of gene family expansion and gene loss was complex. We finally show that different
Populus tissues express unique suites of protease genes and that the mRNA levels of different
classes of proteases change along a developmental gradient.
Conclusion: Recent gene family expansion and contractions have made the Arabidopsis and
Populus complements of proteases different and this, together with expression patterns, gives
indications about the roles of the individual gene products or groups of proteases.

Background
Proteolysis is a poorly understood aspect of plant molecular biology. Although proteases play crucial roles in
many important processes in plant cells, e.g. responses to
changes in environmental conditions, senescence and cell
death, very little information is available on the substrate
specificity and physiological roles of the various plant
proteases. Even for the most abundant plant protein, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco),

neither the proteases involved in its degradation nor the
cellular location of the process are known. In the Arabidopsis thaliana (hereafter Arabidopsis) genome, many genes
with sequence similarities to known proteases have been
identified; the MEROPS database (release 7.30) of Arabidopsis proteases contains 676 entries, corresponding to
almost 3 % of the proteome. However, protease activity
has only been demonstrated for a few of the entries. Most
of these putative proteases are found in extended gene

families and are likely to have overlapping functions,
complicating attempts to dissect the roles of the different
proteases in plant metabolism and development.
One scenario in which proteases play a very important
role is senescence, although it still is discussed if they actually cause senescence or purely are involved in resource
mobilization.
Senescence is the final stage of plant development and can
be induced by a number of both external and internal factors such as age, prolonged darkness, plant hormones,
biotic or abiotic stress and seasonal responses. An important function of senescence is to reallocate nutrients,
nitrogen in particular, to other parts of the plant before
the specific structure is degraded. The understanding of
senescence is very important for biomass production. In
order to understand more about the role of proteases during senescence in this study we compare the nuclear
genome of Arabidopsis thaliana and Populus trichocarpa. The
close relationship of these two species in the plant kingdom [2] allows a direct comparison of an annual plant
with a tree that has to cope with highly variable adaptations during its long life span. Recent research has shown
that leaf senescence affects the chloroplast much earlier
than the mitochondria or other compartments of the cell
[3], we therefore chose to focus on protease families that
express members in this plastid as well as on the papain
protease family which consists of proteases that are wellknown to be involved in senescence.
In the chloroplast at least 11 different protease families
are represented, however, several of them work as processing peptidases. Only 6 families posses members that are
known to be involved in degradation, four of these families belong to the class of serine proteases, two are metalloproteases. The Deg proteases form one family (S1,
chymotrypsin family) inside the serine clade and the ATPdependent Clp proteases are grouped in the S14 family.
The S16 family contains the so-called Lon proteases. Metalloproteases (MPs) are proteases with a divalent cation
cofactor that binds to the active site; most commonly Zn2+
is ligated to two Histidines in the sequence HEXXH. However, Zn2+ can be replaced by Co2+, Mn2+ or even Mg2+. The
M41 family is the group of FtsH proteases and the EGY
(ethylene-dependent gravitropism-deficient and yellowgreen) proteases belong to the family of S2P proteases
(M50).
Comparative genomics analyses could provide valuable
insights into the conservation, evolution, abundance and
roles of the various plant protease families. For instance,
such analyses should facilitate the detection of protein
sequences that are conserved in different species, and thus
are likely to have common functions in them, and recent

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/30

expansions of gene families, which should help elucidate
issues concerning non-functionalization, neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization. Thus, as reported here,
we undertook a comparative analysis of protease gene
families in the two sequenced dicot genomes, those of the
annual plant Arabidopsis and the tree Populus trichocarpa
(hereafter Populus), with special emphasis on proteases
which may play a role in senescence. The results should
help to provide a framework for further elucidation of the
nature and roles of these complex gene families.

Results
Most protease gene families are larger in Populus than in
Arabidopsis
We made an analysis of all protease genes of Arabidopsis
and Populus. As noted above, conservation of a protein
sequence in these two species indicates that it is likely to
have a common function in them. Recent expansions of
gene families, on the other hand, could provide indications of different adaptive requirements (and, possibly, of
more general differences between annual plants and
trees).

The results of the genome comparison between Arabidopsis and Populus are compiled in Table 1. In total, we identified 723 genes coding for putative proteases in
Arabidopsis and 955 in Populus. Forty-five previously unidentified Arabidopsis genes were detected that were not
present in the MEROPS database at the time. Like most of
the genes in the MEROPS database, we do not know
whether or not these genes code for active proteases, but
due to their sequence similarity they could have protease
activity and were included in the comparison. Figure 1
shows a graphic representation of this comparison. Generally the protease gene numbers in each family do not
vary greatly between the two species, although Populus has
more members in most subfamilies, a consequence of its
genome history. Both lineages have undergone rather
recent genome duplications [4,5] but the evolutionary
clock seems to tick almost six-fold slower in the Populus as
compared to the Arabidopsis lineage and loss of duplicated genes have been much retarded [4,5]. However,
some families were more expanded than others, especially
the A11 subfamily of aspartic proteases (the copia transposon endopeptidase family), which has 20 members in
Arabidopsis and 123 members in Populus. Since the characteristic sequence of these proteases is part of the copiatransposable element, which is abundant in Populus [5,6],
this expansion is likely to have been simply a consequence
of the multiplication of the transposon, rather than selection pressure to increase the copy number of the protease
per se. Therefore, this family will not be mentioned further. Some subfamilies (the aspartic-type A22, cysteinetype C56, serine-types S49 and S28, and metallo-types
M1, M14 and M38) have twice as many members in Pop-

ulus compared to Arabidopsis, but in Arabidopsis these
numbers are low, thus duplication could have readily
occurred. An interesting case is the subfamily C48, the
Ulp1 (ubiquitin-like protease) endopeptidase family,
cystein-type, which contains SUMO (small ubiquitin-like
modifier) deconjugating enzymes, with 77 members in
Arabidopsis, but only 13 in Populus. This protein family
has been shown to cleave not only the SUMO precursor,
but also SUMO ligated to its target proteins; SUMO-ligation probably being involved in many cellular processes,
including nuclear export and stress responses [7] and
flowering [8]. This family appears to have greatly
expanded in Arabidopsis recently.
To confirm the findings described above, case studies were
performed in more detail, focusing on proteases that are
known to be present in the plant plastids and mitochondria, partly because we have a special interest in organellar
biology and partly because these proteases generally
belong to the best characterized plant protease families.
The "organellar protease subfamilies" chosen for detailed
comparisons were: the Deg/HtrA family (chymotrypsin
family, S1), Lon protease family (S16), rhomboid protease family (S54) and the Clp endopeptidase family
(S14), all belonging to the serine-type class, and the metallo-type FtsH endopeptidase family (M41). In addition,
we examined the papain-like cysteine protease family
(C1) as certain members are known to play an important
role in leaf development, being the necessary machinery
that the leaf needs to respond to different kind of stresses
or to undergo senescence.
The FtsH protease family
FtsHs are ATP-dependent proteases that based on the Xray crystallographic analysis form a homo-oligomeric hexameric ring [9]. E. coli FtsH has two transmembrane
domains towards the N-terminus that anchor it in the
plasma membrane, while the protease domain and the Cterminus face the cytoplasm [10]. Four isomers of FtsH
have been identified in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, 12 in
Arabidopsis [11]. Of the nine FtsH that reside in the chloroplast, five have been shown to be involved in the degradation of photosynthetic proteins during light
acclimation [12,13] or after high light damage [14-17].

In Arabidopsis the FtsH family is encoded by 16 homologous sequences [11]. Four of these sequences lack the Znbinding motif and are therefore thought to have lost proteolytic activity. However, they might be involved in chaperone functions instead [18]. In this work we focused on
these presumably active proteases. FtsH proteases are
thought to be membrane integral, as has been shown
experimentally for FtsH1. This protease is inserted into the
thylakoid membrane with the Zn-binding and ATPase
motifs facing the stroma [14]. Gene comparison studies

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/30

showed that of the 12 ftsH genes potentially coding for
fully functional proteases 10 are found in highly homologous pairs. While the pairs AtFtsH1/5, AtFtsH2/8 and
AtFtsH 7/9 are targeted to the chloroplast, AtFtsH3/10 and
AtFtsH4 have been identified in mitochondria [18,19].
AtFtsH11, which contains only one transmembrane
domain was recently suggested to be located in both chloroplasts and mitochondria [19,20]. AtFtsH12 and
AtFtsH6, both localized in the chloroplast [12,21] have no
pair-partners. The proteins in a pair very likely work in
concert, and have overlapping functions as shown for
FtsH1/5 and FtsH2/8 [22]. These pairs of proteases are the
most strongly expressed FtsHs in plants. Deletion mutants
of these genes lead to a variegated leaf type, therefore the
names Var1 and Var2 were given to them (reviewed by
Sakamoto et al. [21]). The only FtsH protein for which a
function has been established, apart from these four proteases, is FtsH6 [13].
Figure 2 shows the phylogenetic tree of the Populus and
Arabidopsis FtsH proteases obtained by Unweighted Pair
Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA), while
their names and accession numbers are given in Table 2.
In Populus, 16 ftsH genes were identified, and in the
UPGMA tree, together with the Arabidopsis sequences, we
differentiated seven groups, which cluster according to the
Arabidopsis FtsH-pairs. When naming the Populus genes
we tried to follow the Arabidopsis nomenclature. However, in many cases, recent duplications seem to have
occurred after the separation of the Populus and Arabidopsis lineages and, thus, there are not always clear orthological relationships between the Arabidopsis and Populus
genes. In such cases, we named the Populus genes according to the lowest numbered of the corresponding Arabidopsis pair, e.g. the Populus sequences most similar to the
AtFtsH3/10 pair were named PtFtsH3.1 and PtFtsH3.2.
The Var2 group, represented by AtFtsH2 and AtFtsH8 in
Arabidopsis, has the most Populus representatives
(PtFtsH2.1, PtFtsH2.2 PtFtsH2.3, PtFtsH2.4 and
PtFtsH2.5); all of which are very closely related and
appear to have originated from a recent gene family
expansion. The Var1 group comprises AtFtsH1, AtFtsH5,
PtFtsH1.1 and PtFtsH1.2. A more distant relative of this
group is PtFtsH1.3, which has no close Arabidopsis
homologue. AtFtsH6 and its Populus ortholog, PtFtsH6,
are closely related to the Var1/Var2 groups, and clearly
separated from the FtsH4/11, FtsH3/10, FtsH7/9 and
FtsH12 groups. Interestingly, while in the pairs FtsH1 and
5, FtsH2 and 8, FtsH3 and 10 and FtsH7 and 9 the duplication of the genes seem to have occurred after the separation of Populus and Arabidopsis, in the pair FtsH4 and
FtsH11 the Arabidopsis proteases have at least one distinct orthologue in Populus. Here subfunctionalization
seems to have occurred, evident by the fact that AtFtsH4 is

found in mitochondria, while AtFtsH11 also can be
located in the chloroplast [19,20].
Some Deg subfamilies are more expanded in Arabidopsis
The Deg proteases form the first family (S1, chymotrypsin
family) inside the serine clade. DegP (or HtrA for high
temperature requirement) was the first Deg protease identified in E. coli [23]. As determined from its crystal structure it functions as homotrimeric oligomer [24], the
catalytic center consisting of the residues His-Asp-Ser typical for most serine proteases (SPs). HtrA also functions as
a chaperone at low temperature [25]. While cyanobacteria
– like E. coli – posses 3 members of this family, in the Arabidopsis genome 16 homologues were found. Deg1, 2, 5
and 8 have been identified in the chloroplast [26,27]. In
plants and cyanobacteria the Deg proteases are thought to
be involved in cell growth, stress responses, PCD and
senescence [28,29].

The Deg protease family in Arabidopsis consists of 16 proteins that are localized in different cellular compartments
and in many cases have unknown functions. AtDeg1,
AtDeg2, AtDeg5 and AtDeg8 are the plastidic members of
the AtDeg group. AtDeg1, AtDeg5 and AtDeg8 have been
localized in the thylakoid lumen of the plant chloroplast
[26,30,31]. AtDeg2 has been identified at the stromal side
of the thylakoid membrane and seems, at least in higher
plants, to be responsible for the degradation of the reaction center D1 protein of Photosystem II (PSII) [27].
Figure 3 provides an overview of the Deg protease family
in Arabidopsis and Populus, while Table 3 lists their accession numbers and names. We have identified 20 Deg

sequences in Populus. In this family some of the Arabidopsis Deg proteases seem to have Populus orthologs (Deg1,
Deg5, Deg8, Deg14) and often additional, more distantly
related Populus homologs (Deg5.2, Deg7.2 and Deg7.3,
Deg14.2) can be found. In other cases (Deg2, Deg9) two
Populus sequences are more similar to each other than to
the corresponding Arabidopsis protease, indicating a
recent gene duplication in Populus. The luminal proteases
[26] Deg1, 5, and 8 form a clade (Figure 3), indicating a
similar function in Populus and also the predicted mitochondrial proteases AtDeg3, AtDeg4, AtDeg6, AtDeg10,
AtDeg11, AtDeg12, AtDeg13 and AtDeg16 are more
closely related. Interestingly only two Populus homologs
were detected in this group, both of which were most similar to AtDeg10. AtDeg16 (At5g54745) is annotated as a
Deg protease in the TAIR database, but has not previously
been included in the overview of Arabidopsis proteases
[11]. The same is true for AtDeg15 (At1g28320), which
has recently been predicted to be localized in peroxisomes
[32].
The Deg17 group consists exclusively of Populus
sequences. These genes code for three proteases that are
not closely related to any Arabidopsis protein, but clearly
belong to the chymotrypsin family and have a Deg structure, perhaps representing a subfamily that was lost during Arabidopsis evolution (Figure 3).
The Clp family
Clp proteases are multi-subunit enzymes in which the catalytic domain and the ATPase domain are split in different
subunits. Structurally they are very similar to the proteasome 26S in eukaryotes [33]; suggesting that these ATP-

dependent proteases are evolutionary related. Proteins in
the plant Clp family, consisting of chaperones and proteases involved in the degradation of misfolded proteins
[34], have been grouped in two different subclasses [35].
The proteolytically active protease is designated ClpP, but
there are also many genes coding for similar proteins lacking the Ser and His amino acid residues of the catalytic
triad, and thus representing an inactive form, named
ClpR, with unknown function. The regulating subunits
work as chaperones that unfold the targeted proteins for
degradation, but may also be involved in protein folding
independent of proteolysis. Class I chaperones contain
two ATP-binding sites like the ClpCs and ClpBs, while the
class II chaperones contain only one ATP binding site, like
ClpD, ClpF and ClpXs [11,36]. Crystallisation studies [37]
have shown that the protease unit, ClpP, forms a tetradecameric barrel-like structure. On one or both ends complexes of ATPase subunits, in E. coli either ClpA or ClpX,
form homo-hexameric rings. In the absence of ClpP these
units can act as chaperones. In chloroplasts, homologues
of ClpB and ClpC, but not ClpA form a complex with
ClpP [38]. Chloroplast genomes of alga and higher plants
contain a gene potentially encoding ClpP and only
recently ClpP was also discovered in the nuclear genome
[39].

We analyzed the homology between Clp proteases in Arabidopsis and Populus (Figure 4 and Table 4). In the Maximum Parsimony Phylogenetic Tree (MPT), not
surprisingly, a clear separation between the catalytic subunits (ClpP/ClpR) and the regulatory ones can be seen. In
the ClpP/ClpR clade, the inactive forms ClpR1, R3 and R4
are more closely related to each other than to the ClpP
proteins and the ClpR2. Arabidopsis ClpR1 has three Populus homologs, ClpR3 has two and ClpR4 one apparent
ortholog.
The ClpR2 sequences from Arabidopis and Populus are
most similar to the ClpP1 proteins, probably representing
a successful case of horizontal gene transfer from the chloroplast to the nucleus that happened before the split of
the lineages leading to Arabidopsis and Populus. AtClpP1
is encoded in the chloroplast. We found five homologous
sequences in the Populus nuclear genome, illustrating the
flux of genetic material from the chloroplast to the nuclear
genome. However, we did not find signs of expression
(i.e. associated ESTs) for any of these putative genes, and
some of them also appeared not to code for full-length
proteins, suggesting that they represent non-functional
DNA inserted into the nuclear genome, therefore they will
not be further considered here. AtClpP2 has four Populus

homologs, most of the remaining catalytic AtClp proteins
have two or more orthologs in Populus, but ClpP3, ClpR2
and ClpR4 each have only one.
The lower part of the MPT in Fig. 4 shows the relationships of the regulatory subunits. Ten well-supported subgroups can be identified: the ClpC3, ClpS, ClpD, ClpC1/
C2, ClpF, ClpT, ClpX groups, two ClpB groups, and the
ClpN57710 group, containing one Arabidopsis and three
Populus genes. The separation of the ClpB1-4, ClpC, ClpD
and ClpF branches is well supported, with ClpC and ClpF
being more closely related to each other than to the other
members. The main difference between the ClpD and
ClpC groups is that they have specific signature sequences,
but they have also been shown to have different expression profiles, ClpDs being specifically expressed in dehydration and senescence [40,41]. The presence of two
different ClpB groups is an interesting feature, which can
be explained by the fact that At1g07200 (AtClpB5) is
grouped by TAIR as a ClpB-related protein. As the nomenclature for ClpB1-4 has already been established, we
decided to name this Arabidopsis/Populus class ClpB5.
AtClpT is a homolog to the bacterial ClpS, a subunit that
in E. coli might regulate the activity of the whole Clp complex [42-44]. In Populus we find 4 homologs.
Similar to the situation in the other protease families,
many Arabidopsis Clp genes have two close homologs in
Populus, but the ClpD and ClpB5 families are more heavily
extended in Populus, both having five Populus genes compared to a single Arabidopsis gene. There are two ClpC
members in each organism. However, both of the Populus
ClpCs seem to be more closely related to AtClpC1 than to
AtClpC2. The ClpX group is predicted to be localized in
the mitochondrial matrix in Arabidopsis [11] and it is
formed by three proteases in each organism. AtClpX2
seems to have a clear ortholog in Populus, while the other
two Populus Cl/pX proteases are more closely related to
AtClpX1.
Lon proteases
Lon proteases (S16 family) are responsible for the degradation of abnormal, damaged and unstable proteins. They
have no membrane-spanning domain and contain the
AAA (ATPases associated with various cellular activities)
and protease domains in one polypeptide. Instead of the
Ser-His-Asp of "classical" serine proteases, in Lon proteases the catalytic site is suggested to be formed by a SerLys dyad [45-47]. A crystal structure of Lon in E. coli was
determined recently and shown to form a hexameric ring
[46]. Lon proteases have been described as mitochondrial
proteases. However, recent studies have predicted their
presence in chloroplasts and peroxisomes [41,48] and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/30

Lon4 was shown to be targeted to both chloroplasts and
mitochondria [44].
Figure 5 and Table 5 show a phylogenetic comparison of
the Lon protease families in Arabidopsis and Populus.
Except for AtLon1, 3, 4 no subclasses could be detected.
However, as for the other families, most Arabidopsis Lon
proteases have several orthologs in Populus: AtLon1,
AtLon2, AtLon5 and AtLon11 are each closely related to a
pair of Populus orthologs, an apparent result of a recent
gene duplication in the tree species. For both AtLon6 and
AtLon10 one Populus ortholog was found, and the only
Arabidopsis Lon proteases that appear to have no Populus
orthologs are AtLon3 and AtLon4, which are very closely
related to each other. One Populus sequence, most strongly
related to Lon5, did not have a close homolog, and was
therefore assigned a name of its own (PtLon12). We have
included the Lon9 and Lon10 groups in the Lon family,
even though they do not have the ATPase Lon domain.
They still belong to the AAA protein family and have some
typical Lon protease domains that we considered relevant
for the study of this family.
Rhomboid proteases
The rhomboid family (S54) is a relatively poorly investigated family. It has been widely detected in bacteria,
archaea and, recently, eukaryotic organisms – initially in
Drosophila melangolaster [49,50], then plants [51]. Rhomboid proteases are membrane proteins with six or seven
transmembrane domains that cleave their substrates
within the substrate's transmembrane domain. This socalled regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) has
been shown to be very important for signal transduction.
In recent studies of Arabidopsis rhomboids a catalytic
dyad has been suggested to be the active site, formed by
Ser-His residues [51,52]. The overall structure and
sequence of the rhomboid proteases, widely conserved
throughout all kingdoms, is very different from that of the
other serine proteases, suggesting that they have become
serine proteases by convergent evolution [53]. Today, 15
members are annotated in Arabidopsis. Another Arabidopsis gene (At5g25640) has high sequence homology to
this family, but it is predicted to code for a protein with
only two membrane-spanning helices and therefore was
not considered in this study. Two rhomboids (AtRbl1 and
2) have been shown to be localized in the Golgi apparatus
[52], the subcellular localization of most of the others is
predicted to be in mitochondria. Only AtRbl9 and 10
were predicted to be located in the chloroplast using the
programs TargetP and Predator. However, the Meta Analysis of the Arabidopsis rhomboid genes in Genevestigator
[54] suggests that some of them may play important roles
in leaf development and senescence.

Figure 6 shows the comparative UPGMA tree of the rhomboid proteases of Arabidopsis and Populus, gene names are
explained in Table 6. AtRbl 1–3 are most homologous to
rho-1 of Drosophila melangolaster and they have 2–3
homologs in Populus, as has AtRbl13. The hypothetical
plastidic rhomboids AtRbl9 and 10, as well as AtRbl11,
AtRbl12, AtRbl14 and AtRbl15 and AtKOM (for kompeitio), each have one clear ortholog in Populus. However,
AtRbl4 – 7 could not be detected in Populus, and these
sequences may have evolved after the Arabidopsis-Populus
divergence.
The EGY proteases belong to the family of S2P proteases
(M50), which are ATP-independent metallo-proteases.
EGY1 has been recently characterized [55] as a required
protease for chloroplast development. With 8 putative
transmembrane domains and the intramembrane Zn2+binding domain, these proteases might have a similar
structure and function as the rhomboids [44], even
though they belong to the class of metalloproteases. The
Arabidopsis genome possesses 3 EGYs, EGY1, having been
identified in the chloroplast, has one possible orthologue
in Populus, EGY2 shows homology to one closer and one
more distant relative in Populus. EGY3 possesses less
homology to the other two Arabidopsis proteases and also
has one orthologue in Populus (not shown).
Cysteine proteases
In animals, the most representative family of this group is
the group of caspases (Cys-Asp-specific proteases, family

C14), which play an important role in programmed cell
death (PCD) and hypersensitive response (HR) controlling the so-called apoptosis cascade. Closely related proteases in plants are the metacaspases (C14), which have
been found to be involved in HR and to act through a caspase-like mechanism [56].
The most abundant and thoroughly studied CP family is
the papain-like (C1) protease family, which has been
related leaf senescence [57-61]. SAG12 (senescence associated gene), the senescence-specific protease [62], is the
only protease to be expressed solely during leaf senescence [61] in Arabidopsis and Brassica napus [63]. This
large family of cysteine proteases also plays diverse roles
in defense against pathogens [64]. Thirty-eight papainlike cysteine proteases were identified in Arabidopsis and
44 in Populus (Fig. 7, Table 7). The xylem-related cysteine
proteases are separated into two different branches, one
consisting of the XCPs (xylem cysteine proteases) with
two Arabidopsis genes and three Populus genes, and the
other consisting of the XBCP (xylem and bark cysteine
protease) from Arabidopsis with four homologs in Populus. The two clades of senescence-related cysteine proteases, including the well-known SAG12 genes, consist of
many more genes in Populus than in Arabidopsis (21 vs.
5). Seven Populus proteases have higher homology to the
Arabidopsis SAG12 than to any other Arabidopsis proteases, making it difficult to predict if any of these proteases is a functional homolog in Populus that plays an
essential role during leaf senescence. The second clade

consists of 10 Populus proteases without any Arabidopsis
homologue, indicating the necessity of these proteases in
a tree versus an annual plant. However, the RD21 proteases (where RD stands for response to dehydration),
that also are known to be involved in senescence, form a
separate group, which has more members in Arabidopsis
than in Populus (nine and five genes, respectively). Also
the group containing homologs to SPCP1 (where SCP
stands for sweet potato-like cysteine protease) includes
seven Arabidopsis genes, but lacks Populus representatives.
Different Populus tissues express unique repertoires of
proteases
The extensive Populus EST resource compiled in PopulusDB [65] allows indications of the expression patterns
of Populus genes to be rapidly obtained. Of the 951 genes
classified above as putative proteases 382 had associated
ESTs in PopulusDB, suggesting that these genes, at least,
are expressed. Since there are correlations, albeit imperfect, between the abundance of ESTs and the levels of corresponding mRNAs and proteins in particular tissues we
wanted to identify the tissues/treatments in which the
mRNAs of different types of proteases are most strongly
represented. To see if other proteases show similar specificity we examined their digital expression profiles, applying two criteria to reduce the numbers of false positives
due to limited information (i.e. the presence of low numbers of ESTs) (table 7). These criteria were (i) more than
four ESTs had to be associated with the candidate gene
and (ii) more than twice as many ESTs had to be detected
in one library than in any other. Only nineteen genes ful-

filled these criteria for specific expression. Interestingly,
members of the Deg-, FtsH- and papain-like proteases
were all highly expressed in senescing leaf tissue. In addition to proteases with particularly high EST frequencies in
the senescing leaf and wood cell death libraries, we identified proteases that appeared to be highly expressed in
flower buds (four), male catkins (two), the cambial zone
(two) and the shoot apical meristem, tension wood, roots
and dormant cambium (one in each case). Tissue-specific
expression may be the result of a subfunctionalization
process, stabilizing both copies of a duplicated gene. To
assess the likelihood that such a process has occurred in
Populus, we sought evidence indicating that unusually
high numbers of these genes have undergone recent
duplications. We found that the overwhelming majority
of the gene families appear to have expanded recently,
from one copy in Arabidopsis to two or three copies in
Populus. This is consistent with the hypothesis that subfunctionalization is one of the forces that has maintained
the high proportion of duplicated genes in Populus.
We also constructed a clustered correlation map [66] for
all protease genes for which we had EST data. This map
(Fig. 8) showed that the different tissues/treatments were
associated with quite specific protease expression patterns. Three main clusters could be identified. The senescing leaf library seemed to express a specific set of proteases
similar to the wood cell death and the cold-stress leaves
libraries, quite distinct from those found in other libraries. But there were also distinct similarities in the patterns
of several other libraries, especially the shoot apical mer-

istem, cambial zone, tension wood, flower bud and
female flower libraries. Although libraries from similar
source material sometimes clustered together (like the
cambial zone, tension wood and active cambium libraries), there were also remarkable differences in the repertoire of proteases expressed in similar tissues in some
cases, e.g. between active and dormant cambium, and
between male and female catkins, which clustered far
away from each other. Taken together, this shows that different Populus tissues express unique suites of proteases.
Most strongly expressed were 8 proteases in the senescing
leave library (Fig. 8). The three most strongly transcribed
proteases belonged to the papain-like family (RD21,
SAG12), followed by proteases with highest similarity to
Arabidopsis ClpC, DegP, FtsH8 and FtsH5. The same proteases also had very specific expression in their tissues
(table 7).
Patterns of protease gene expression during Populus leaf
development
Since we have a particular interest in leaf proteases, we
examined the expression of these proteases during Populus
leaf development in more detail. Over a developmental
gradient, it is easy to imagine a number of plausible
expression patterns. The simplest may be that some proteases, with functions during leaf expansion, may be
expressed in young leaves and their expression levels may
gradually decrease, whereas opposite patterns would be
expected for others, involved in leaf senescence. Yet others
may have different, more complex, patterns. For this analysis, we used two DNA microarray datasets from a mature

aspen (Populus tremula) grown in the field in Umeå, Sweden [67] (Sjödin et al., submitted). Mature aspens are particularly useful since they only have one flush in the
spring, so every leaf at a given date is of the same age, facilitating transcript profiling over a developmental gradient.
Bud burst occurs at the end of May and June, and
progresses through several phases, during which cell elongation and primary cell wall formation occur, then secondary cell formation peaks. During July and August, no
strong trends in gene expression occur and in September,
leaf senescence starts [67,68]. We extracted expression
profiles for all microarray elements, showing reasonable
expression levels some time during leaf development, and
performed a hierarchical clustering on the expression profiles (see Additional file 1). As expected, many different
patterns were found, but based on the clustering results
twelve major patterns were detected. All but three array
elements coding for a putative protease exhibited one of
these twelve common expression patterns. The expression
profiles shown in Figure 9 are representations of these
twelve patterns. The two array datasets do not have a common reference, therefore the two expression profiles are
separated by a gap in the line. The sampling dates for the
first experiment were August 17, August 24, September 3,
September 7, September 14, September 17 and September
21, 1999 and the sampling dates for the second series
were May 25, June 1, June 9, June 15, June 22, June 29,
July 6, July 18, July 27, August 3, August 11, August 18,
August 29 and September 12, 2000. Despite these limitations, these data can be used to classify the expression patterns of the leaf proteases.

Figure 9 most common protease expression patterns during Populus leaf development
The twelve
The twelve most common protease expression patterns during Populus leaf development. Populus DNA microarray data were
processed in UPSC-BASE (Sjödin et al. 2006). Samples for microarray analysis were taken from free-growing aspen in Umeå on
the following dates; May 25, June 1, June 9, June 15, June 29, July 6, July 18, July 27, August 3, August 11, August 18, August 29
and September 12 2000, and Aug 17, Aug 24, Sept 03, Sept 07, Sept 14 and Sept 17 1999. The two sample series are identified
by separate lines in the profiles.

The genes in cluster 1 are the truly senescence-associated
genes. Their mRNA levels did not notably increase until
September, but their expression then continued to
increase in successive samples, including the last sample
from which RNA could be prepared, collected on September 21. This expression pattern was exhibited by genes
encoding protease classes C1 (2 genes), C13, C19, M41,
M48, S14, S33 (three genes each) and T2 (two genes), i.e.
a number of the classes with previously indicated roles
during leaf senescence (such as papain-like proteases and
FtsH). Cluster 2 had a similar pattern, but the changes
were less pronounced, so these genes were only moderately induced during leaf senescence. This cluster contained genes from classes C1, M16, M50, S1, S9 and S14.
Cluster 3 consisted of genes that had a fairly stable expression throughout the growing season, but with low mRNA
levels during both bud burst and leaf senescence. Pattern
4 was only represented by a S8 (subtilisin) protease gene,
which had a pronounced peak during the cell wall biosynthesis phase in the leaf and decreased to low levels in
older leaves. Cluster 5 genes were mainly expressed during
the first two weeks of leaf development (during the phases

mainly characterized by cell division and cell expansion)
whereas cluster 6 genes showed the opposite pattern, i.e.
they were much more strongly expressed after, rather than
during the first two weeks. Cluster 6 was a major cluster,
including four genes in the C1 class, seven in the S14
(Clp) class, two in the M1 class, and four other classes.
Almost half of the genes coding for proteins in the Clp
family appeared to be specifically down regulated when
the leaf expanded, suggesting that they have no important
function in this stage of leaf development. Clusters 7, 8
and 9 all contain proteases of many different classes, and
all showed essentially constitutive expression patterns,
except that cluster 7 had lower mRNA levels in the middle
of the summer. Clusters 10 and 11, containing mainly serine proteases, both showed high mRNA levels in the first
week of leaf development, but cluster 10 seemed to be
induced later in the season. Almost all proteasome subunits exhibited expression pattern 11, indicating that the
proteasome is most important at the very first stages of
aspen leaf development from winter buds. Finally, cluster
12 showed high expression levels only in very young
leaves and during late stages of senescence. Taken

together, these data indicate that there are several "waves"
of protease gene expression during leaf development; consistent with the idea that proteases are important during
all stages of the lifecycle of the leaf.

Discussion
We here present a comparative analysis of the gene families coding for putative proteases of Arabidopsis and Populus. The patterns for the copy numbers of most families
and subfamilies were quite consistent – the Populus families were generally larger, as an apparent result of the fairly
recent genome duplication [4,5]. Some families were considerably more heavily represented in Populus, but a few
were more abundant in Arabidopsis. It seems reasonable
to expect, for example, a tree like Populus to show relatively strong retention of families like RD21 and SAG12,
which are involved in the response to dehydration and
leaf senescence, respectively – traits that would intuitively
require more elaborate regulation in a tree than in an
annual plant, but surprisingly the RD21 family was one of
the few gene families that was larger in Arabidopsis than
in Populus. This supports the view that a considerable element of chance has influenced the size of the gene families in Populus, and that stochastic events as well as
subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization are
important determinants of whether genes are lost or
retained in a duplicated genome. Therefore, in most cases,
the presence of higher numbers of genes in one plant species than in another cannot be explained simply by their
adaptive "needs". However, subfunctionalization and
neofunctionalization should not be neglected – in fact, we
have shown that they have affected the evolution of the
Populus genome [69], and our analysis of genes with tissue-specific expression patterns supports this notion.
Unfortunately, of the 723 and 955 proteases identified in
Arabidopsis and Populus, respectively, the function(s),
localization and substrate(s) of most of the proteases
remain enigmatic. The Var1/Var2/FtsH6 proteases comprise one of the few protease groups for which mutant
phenotypes in Arabidopsis have been carefully examined,
and placed in a phylogenetic perspective [13]. Their function in photoprotection seems to have evolved at a very
early stage, in the cyanobacterial progenitors of modern
cyanobacteria, algae and plants [70]. Later, the Var1 and
Var2 functions appear to have separated, and there seems
to be an overlap in the substrate specificity of the proteases and the phenotypes of the mutants. Var1 and var2
are more sensitive than wild type to PSII photoinhibition
[15,16]. This duplication of the genes appears to have
happened after the separation of Arabidopsis and Populus
(see Fig. 2). However, in the lineage leading to higher
plants, within this group the FtsH6 evolved through neofunctionalization; this protease degrades the antenna
rather than reaction center proteins. A clear ortholog of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/30

AtFtsH6 can also be found in Populus. Based on this very
limited information we raise the following hypothesis. If
there is a one-to-one relationship between the Populus and
Arabidopsis sequences, we assume that these genes are
functional orthologs, i.e. they degrade the same substrate(s) under the same conditions. However, if the gene
duplication happened after the split between Arabidopsis
and Populus lineages, no neofunctionalization has probably occurred yet, so the functions of these proteases are
overlapping. Experiments to verify this hypothesis are in
progress.

Conclusion
Our analysis shows that different tissues express fairly
unique sets of genes putatively coding for proteases. Furthermore, in the developmental gradient from bud burst
to leaf senescence different waves of protease gene expression occur. However, expression analysis does not always
give clear evidence of function. For example, AtFtsH6 has
been shown to degrade LHCII only during high light acclimation and senescence [13]; although this protease is
essentially constitutively expressed in leaves, its proteolytic activity is regulated by the availability of the substrate. Forward or reverse genetics will be needed to obtain
clear information on the involvement of various proteases
in different biological processes. However, in order to
make reverse genetics efficient, comparative genomics
data, such as those presented in this paper, facilitate selection of the best candidates. A simple comparative analysis
can provide explanations for experimental data. Since the
AtFtsH1/FtsH5 and AtFtsH2/FtsH8 pairs have separated
after the split of lineages leading to Populus and Arabidopsis, it is not surprising that the pairs will have overlapping
and partially redundant functions [71]. This means that
mutant analysis, either by forward or reverse genetics, will
not always provide clear answers; in many cases, biochemical analysis of protease substrate specificities will
probably be needed to assign functions to the individual
members of the large protease gene families.
In summary, we have identified 951 genes in the Populus
genome potentially coding for proteases and comparatively analyzed the protease composition of Populus and
Arabidopsis.

Methods
Database search
The databases searched for annotated proteases were TAIR
(The Arabidopsis Information Resource) and TrEMBL (a
Computer-annotated supplement to Swiss-Prot). The data
were grouped according to the MEROPS protease database
families.

Page 21 of 24

BMC Plant Biology 2006, 6:30

Using the TIGR At locus for annotated proteases an
ortholog search was performed in the Populus trichocarpa
database [5,72].
In addition, a blastp search was used to collect the Populus
gene models that were not clustered with any of the Arabidopsis genes. To confirm that these new gene models
from Populus corresponded to protease genes, a proteasemotif search was made in SMART 4.0 [73] and InterProScan [74]. Protein sequences that did not have a typically
protease family motif were discarded.
Protein alignment and Phylogenetic trees
Protein alignment was performed with ClustalX 1.81 [75].
Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were
conducted using MEGA version 2.1 [76]. The FtsH, Deg,
Lon and rhomboid trees were derived using an
Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean
(UPGMA) method with 1000 bootstraps. The trees for the
Clp and papain-like proteases are Maximum parsimony
trees (MPT) with 1000 bootstraps.

All families were analysed with both algorithms, and with
several different gap penalties. The choice of trees to display was driven by a desire to keep known or suspected
orthologous gene clusters in the same branch of the tree,
and to produce figures with size and shape suitable for
printing. Trees produced with other algorithms and settings are available on request.

Ewing et.al. [66] with some modifications. Briefly, similarity between gene models or cDNA library expression
profiles was estimated by Pearson's coefficient. From the
gene model correlations a pairwise Manhattan distance
matrix was calculated and the dendrogram was created
with the average agglomeration method. The order of
gene models and libraries in their respective dendrograms
were used to reorder the original data table. All calculations and plotting were done in the programme language
R . [79]
DNA microarray data from Andersson et.al. [67] and Sjödin et al. (submitted) were merged and processed in
UPSC-BASE according to the default analysis pipeline
[78] . The normalised data were hierarchical clustered
with Euclidean distance and average linkage in the TIGR
MultiExperiment Viewer (MeV) [80] . The dataset were
divided into 12 clusters (see Additional file 1) and the
average log ratio for each cluster was plotted.

Authors' contributions
MGL carried out the database searches, sequence alignment, phylogenetic trees performance and drafted the
manuscript. AS carried out the expression analysis. SJ and
CF conceived of the study, participated in its design and
coordination and helped to draft the manuscript.
All authors read and approved the final manuscript.

Additional material
The Arabidopsis nomenclature used in this article follows
that proposed by Adam et.al. [41] and further developed
by Sokolenko et.al. [11]. As in this nomenclature, protein
names were given for Populus proteases according to their
clustering or proximity in the tree, allowing an intuitive
association between the Populus proteins and the closest
Arabidopsis proteins. We have organized the proteins into
groups based on their sequence homology in order to
facilitate the new nomenclature proposed for Populus proteases.
For the rhomboid proteases in Arabidopsis, we followed
the nomenclature initiated by Kanaoka et.al. [52], naming
the closest to DmRho-1 (the first rhomboid protease
described from Drosophila melanogaster) AtRbl1. Since the
previously named AtKOM is the 8th member of the family
in Kanaoka's article we continued at AtRbl9; higher numbers indicate increasingly distant relationships to
DmRho-1.
Expression analysis
Digital expression profiles were obtained from PopulusDB [77], and analysed in UPSC-BASE [78] . The similarity between gene models (rows) or cDNA library
(columns) expression profiles was estimated according to
