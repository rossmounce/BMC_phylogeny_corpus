Abstract
Background: Genes involved in post-mating processes of multiple mating organisms are known to evolve
rapidly due to coevolution driven by sexual conflict among male-female interacting proteins. In the malaria
mosquito Anopheles gambiae - a monandrous species in which sexual conflict is expected to be absent or
minimal - recent data strongly suggest that proteolytic enzymes specifically expressed in the female lower
reproductive tissues are involved in the processing of male products transferred to females during mating. In
order to better understand the role of selective forces underlying the evolution of proteins involved in postmating responses, we analysed a cluster of genes encoding for three serine proteases that are down-regulated
after mating, two of which specifically expressed in the atrium and one in the spermatheca of A. gambiae
females.
Results: The analysis of polymorphisms and divergence of these female-expressed proteases in closely related
species of the A. gambiae complex revealed a high level of replacement polymorphisms consistent with relaxed
evolutionary constraints of duplicated genes, allowing to rapidly fix novel replacements to perform new or more
specific functions. Adaptive evolution was detected in several codons of the 3 genes and hints of episodic
selection were also found. In addition, the structural modelling of these proteases highlighted some important
differences in their substrate specificity, and provided evidence that a number of sites evolving under selective
pressures lie relatively close to the catalytic triad and/or on the edge of the specificity pocket, known to be
involved in substrate recognition or binding. The observed patterns suggest that these proteases may interact with
factors transferred by males during mating (e.g. substrates, inhibitors or pathogens) and that they may have
differently evolved in independent A. gambiae lineages.
Conclusions: Our results - also examined in light of constraints in the application of selection-inference methods
to the closely related species of the A. gambiae complex - reveal an unexpectedly intricate evolutionary scenario.
Further experimental analyses are needed to investigate the biological functions of these genes in order to better
interpret their molecular evolution and to assess whether they represent possible targets for limiting the fertility of
Anopheles mosquitoes in malaria vector control strategies.

Background
Sexual reproduction in organisms with internal fertilization is known to be mediated by a series of molecular
interactions between the male ejaculate and female
reproductive factors [1,2]. Since these interactions are
fundamental to fertilization and, thus, for organismal fitness, molecular coevolution has been suggested to arise
between male components and interacting female proteins [1,3,4]. While rapid evolution driven by positive
selection has been extensively documented in reproductive proteins from a number of organisms in which multiple matings occur (e.g. in Drosophila sp.), studies in
monandrous species have been so far neglected, as it
has been argued that low divergence levels should be
expected because of the reduced extent of sexual selection (e.g. cryptic female choice of male traits) and/or
sexual conflict (i.e. the evolutionary arms race between
the sexes, where each sexual counterpart attempts to
achieve its own reproductive optimum at a fitness cost
to the opposite sex) [5,6].
In Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.), the major
malaria vector species in Sub-Saharan Africa, females
mate a single time during their lifetime, after which they
become refractory to further copulation. Multiple matings in natural populations of A. gambiae s.s. occur in a
small percentage of individuals (~2%) and may be
caused by the incomplete transfer of male seminal secretions [7,8]. This species belongs to the A. gambiae
complex which includes other six morphologically indistinguishable allied species and two incipient M and S
molecular forms within A. gambiae s.s. [9-11]. Only few
data on the frequency of multiple matings in natural
populations are available for these closely related taxa of
A. gambiae s.s. (e.g. 0.13% in A. melas) [12], however, in
general, females of the A. gambiae species complex are
believed to be monandrous. Although the molecular
triggers of female refractoriness to multiple copulations
are not yet known, it has been observed that transfer of
male seminal secretions is essential for modulating
A. gambiae s.s. female post-mating physiology and behavior [8,13]. Seminal secretions produced in the male
accessory glands (MAGs) are transferred to the female
atrium (uterus) during copulation in the form of a gelatinous ‘mating plug’, which is digested within 24 hours
after copulation [12]. Recent studies showed that the
mating plug is not an efficient physical barrier to reinsemination, but it is an essential reproductive feature
in A. gambiae s.s., as its formation and transfer are
necessary to ensure correct sperm storage by the female
[8]. Moreover, recent data strongly points to a key role
of atrial proteolytic enzymes in plug digestion: in fact
i) these proteases are expressed at high levels in the
virgin atrium and considerably down-regulated by

Page 2 of 18

24 hours after mating [14] when the mating plug is
mostly digested, and ii) some of them were detected by
mass spectrometry analysis on mating plug samples dissected from freshly mated females [8].
In this study we examined the patterns of molecular
evolution of three female-expressed serine proteases
that are encoded by three genes (namely AGAP005194,
AGAP005195 and AGAP005196) clustered on chromosome 2L in the A. gambiae genome (Figure 1). These
are amongst the A. gambiae s.s. genes most strongly
down-regulated by mating: AGAP005194 and AGAP
005195 are exclusively expressed in the atrium and are
associated with the mating plug [8,14], whereas
AGAP005196 is predominantly expressed in the sperm
storage organ, the spermatheca [14]. These proteolytic
enzymes may therefore play a role in mating plug
digestion and/or other reproductive processes important for mosquito fertility.
Our main interest was to highlight signatures of adaptive evolution in these 3 serine protease genes within
the well-defined cryptic and incipient (i.e. the M and S
forms) species of the A. gambiae complex. In fact, there
is a considerable intrinsic value in studying the role of
natural selection in genes controlling reproduction in
the most important malaria vectors in Sub-Saharan
Africa, as a better knowledge of the still largely
unknown genetic bases of their post-mating physiological and behavioral responses could open perspectives for
the development of novel tools to manipulate their fertility and fecundity. In addition, the recently radiated
A. gambiae species represent an interesting model to
study the adaptive evolution of genes potentially
involved in the build-up of reproductive isolating barriers. However, the application of selection-inference
methods in closely related taxa, such as those of the
A. gambiae complex, imposes some limitations and a
critical evaluation of the results [15,16]. Thus, to provide
the best possible interpretation of the inferred positive
selected sites and to corroborate their possible functional significance, these were mapped on the reconstructed 3D models of the three serine proteases.

Overall, our results stimulate further studies to elucidate the role of this gene family in determining the
reproductive success of A. gambiae taxa and allow to
speculate on the relative importance of selective forces
underlying the evolution of post-mating characters by
comparing the observed patterns with those available for
polyandrous organisms.

Overall, these results suggest that the novel paralog is
placed in the same chromosomal division (2L, 21E) of
the other three genes (and possibly in the same gene
cluster, Figure 1) in A. gambiae and in all examined species of the A. gambiae complex, indicating that a tandem gene duplication occurred in this specific genomic
region.

Results

Divergence, polymorphisms and gene tree inferences

Sequencing data

Divergence (and polymorphisms) among the species of
the A. gambiae complex are reported below for each
gene and summarized in Table 1 (and Additional file 3).
Bayesian gene trees reconstructed from the coding
regions of each gene are depicted in Figure 2. In general,
we found that A. merus and A. melas were more frequently included in monophyletic clusters, whereas
A. gambiae M- and S- molecular forms (undergoing a
process of incipient speciation [10]) shared many alleles
at all loci. Henceforth A. gambiae s.s. was considered as
a single taxonomic unit in some of our subsequent analyses. The results obtained are reported below for each
gene analysed.
AGAP005194: on average, 80 segregating sites were
found in the coding region of this gene (16% of the total
number of nucleotide sites) and 41 out 163 (25%) amino
acid positions were variable. The average nucleotide
diversity (π) was 0.036. Out of the 102 sequences
obtained, 57 different alleles were found. The highest
haplotype diversity (Hd) was found in A. gambiae
S-form (0.980) and in A. arabiensis (0.965), whereas the
lowest value was detected in A. quadriannulatus (0.582).
π within species/forms ranged from 0.014 (A. melas) to
0.028 (A. gambiae S-form) and from 0.017 to 0.041 and
from 0.011 to 0.025 at synonymous (πs) and nonsynonymous (π a ) sites, respectively (Additional file 3). Dxy
ranged from 0.022 to 0.059, with the highest values of

Partial sequences of 489, 603 and 456 bp were obtained
for the coding regions of AGAP005194 (transcript = 940
bp, total protein = 272 aa), AGAP005195 (transcript =
867 bp, total protein = 250 aa) and AGAP005196 (transcript = 1115 bp, total protein = 264 aa), respectively
(Figure 1). Furthermore, under the same PCR conditions
used for the amplification of AGAP005196, we identified
a novel paralog, not yet annotated in the A. gambiae
genome. This paralog is similar to AGAP005196 but
characterised by a 368 bp insertion of a miniature
inverted repeat transposable element (MITE) in the
third intron (Additional file 1). This inserted element is
61.8% AT-rich and forms a putative stable secondary
structure, as characteristic of the TA-I-a-Ag MITE
family [17]. Because of these features, the MITE insertion represented a difficult template for amplification
and, despite several efforts, we failed to optimize PCR/
sequencing protocols. However, we were able to obtain
9 sequences for 4 out of the 5 analysed species of the
A. gambiae complex. FISH experiments (Additional
file 2) performed on A. gambiae, A. arabiensis and
A. merus chromosomes using a probe binding to the
common sequences (intron 2 and exon 3) of both
AGAP005196 and the novel copy revealed a single signal in subdivision 21E of the 2L chromosome arm. The
same result was obtained using an additional probe.

Branches leading to single individuals (or included in specific-lineages) are depicted with species-specific colours: A. gambiae (blue), A. arabiensis
(yellow), A. quadriannulatus (violet), A. melas (green), A. merus (red); monophyletic clades are shaded accordingly. The value of ω (> 1) in
AGAP005196 is reported below the branch separating the A. gambiae-like from the A. melas-like groups of alleles (enclosed in dashed and
contiguous lines, respectively). In all trees, branch lengths are scaled according to nucleotide substitutions per site.

divergence found in pairwise comparisons with A. merus
(Table 1). The phylogenetic tree based on the HKY+I+G
(pinv = 0.6580; shape = 0.6680) model was not fully
resolved (Figure 2a): most species were included in nonmonophyletic assemblages (gsi values = 0.25-0.56), with
the exception of A. merus (gsi = 1.0). This species

clustered in a separated clade (supported by a posterior
probability of 0.91), although embedded in a larger clade
also including individuals from other species.
AGAP005195: a total of 80 segregating sites were
found in the coding region of this gene (13% of the total
number of nucleotide sites), and 43 out 201 (21%)

amino acid sites were variable. The average π was 0.029.
Out of the 96 allele sequences obtained, 53 haplotypes
were found. The highest and the lowest Hd values were
found in A. gambiae (0.986) and A. melas (0.699),
respectively. Species/forms π ranged from 0.001
(A. melas) to 0.011 (A. gambiae). A null value of πs was
found in A. merus (i.e. absence of intra-specific synonymous substitutions), whereas the highest value πs was
observed in A. gambiae M-form (0.023). The lowest
value of πa was scored in A. melas (0.001) and the highest in A. gambiae (0.009) (Additional file 3). Dxy ranged
from 0.010 (A. gambiae vs. A. arabiensis) to 0.067
(A. gambiae vs. A. merus) (Table 1). In the phylogenetic
tree based on the HKY+I+G model (pinvar = 0.6830;
shape = 0,7280), alleles of A. melas and A. merus are
grouped in two monophyletic clades (supported by posterior probability values of 0.97 and 1.0, gsi = 0.93 and
1.0, respectively) that are clustered together (0.98 support). A. quadriannulatus alleles are also grouped
together in a single clade (1.0 support; gsi = 1.0), but
embedded in a larger clade where A. gambiae and
A. arabiensis alleles are mixed.
AGAP005196: a total of 58 segregating sites were
found in the coding region in this gene (13% of the
total number of nucleotide sites), and 34 out 152 (22%)
amino acid sites were variable. The average π was
0.026. Out of the 122 allele sequences, 49 haplotypes
were found. The highest and lowest Hd values were
found in A. gambiae (0.960) and A. merus (0.400),
respectively. Species/forms π ranged from 0.001
(A. merus) to 0.018 (A. quadriannulatus); π s ranged
from a null value (A. merus) to 0.028 (A. arabiensis)
and πa from 0.001 (A. merus) to 0.017 (A. quadriannulatus) (Additional file 3). Dxy ranged from 0.019
(A. gambiae vs. A. quadriannulatus) to 0.044 (A. arabiensis vs. A. merus). In the bayesian phylogenetic
reconstruction based on the HKY+I (pinvar = 0.8170)
model, two major groups were strongly separated and
supported at their nodes: one group (hereafter named
as the A. gambiae-like group) includes all A. gambiae
alleles and most of A. arabiensis + A. quadriannulatus
alleles. The second clade (hereafter named as the
A. melas-like group) includes all alleles of A. melas and
A. merus, 2 A. arabiensis alleles (from 1 Kenyan specimen) and 4 A. quadriannulatus alleles (from 2 Zimbabwean specimens). In particular, A. merus (gsi = 1.0) is
well separated from A. melas (with a high level of
exclusive ancestry of its alleles, gsi = 0.86), and alleles
of A. arabiensis and A. quadriannulatus are included in
the same clade. In the A. gambiae-like group, on the
contrary, alleles are not split in species-specific monophyletic groups, although A. gambiae alleles show a
quite high level of exclusive ancestry (gsi = 0.71).

plotted against the estimates of sequence divergence (t). Redand green-filled circles represents inter-specific comparisons with
A. merus and A. melas, respectively. A. merus intra-specific
comparisons are represented with red-open circles. The straight line
indicates the neutral expectation (ω = 1).

dN/dS pairwise comparison and McDonald-Kreitman test

Pairwise comparisons of Maximum Likelihood (ML)
estimates [18] of dS and dN are plotted in Figure 3. The
range of sequence divergence - defined as the expected
number of nucleotide substitutions per codon (t) - is
comparable for AGAP005194 and AGAP005195 (0.000.24), whereas a smaller t range was scored for
AGAP005196 (t = 0.00-0.15). In general, a pattern of
puryfing selection was observed for AGAP005194, especially at high divergence levels. However, most of
A. merus intra-specific comparisons for t < 0.06 showed
ω > > 1 (or ‘infinite’; i.e. absence of intra-specific synonymous polymorphisms), whereas ω was ~ 1 at 0.08 <t
< 0.17. In addition, at t < 0.05, ω > > 1 was also scored
for several intra-specific comparisons within the

Mancini et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:72
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/72

A. gambiae S-form and A. arabiensis, and for some
inter-specific comparisons. A general pattern of purifying selection (d S >d N ) was also observed for
AGAP005195. Apart from values scored at a low divergence level (t < 0.1), the other pairwise comparisons fell
in two discrete and strikingly delimitated clusters corresponding to: i) all inter-specific comparisons with
A. melas (t = 0.11-0.16) and, ii) all inter-specific comparisons with A. merus, except for those with A. melas
that are already included in the first cluster (t = 0.170.24). Since the computed genetic distances are not
independent from the data used to estimate dN and dS,
it is notable that divergence estimates in most interspecific pairwise comparisons involving A. merus are
inflated for the co-occurence of a high number of replacements and the absence of synonymous substitutions
at intra-specific level. In fact, the relationship between
dS and genetic distances is linear only when A. merus is
not considered (r2 = 0.9207, slope = 0.5392), whereas
linearity for dN and genetic distances is observed even
when computed on the whole dataset (r2 = 0.9745, slope
= 0.3047). Also for this gene, ω is > > 1 and increases
linearly with different slopes in pairwise comparisons at
divergence levels < 0.1. As already mentioned, a smaller
t range was scored for AGAP005196 (t = 0.00-0.15). It
is worth to note that ω increases steadily with t in this
gene - following a similar trend to that observed for the
other two genes in the same range of divergence - and
that ω was > 1 (1.07-5.26) in most of inter-specific comparisons involving A. melas.
This relative preponderance of nonsynonymous
changes has been also noted in closely related sequences
obtained from other taxa [19,20]. As argued by some
authors, ω estimates from a set of conspecific sequences
are not appropriate to detect patterns of selection,
because the observed differences at this level represent
segregating polymorphisms as opposed to fixed substitutions [21]. This consideration should be also extended
to closely related species, whose introgression and/or
recent ancestry affect lineage sorting of alleles, so that
differences among them might not represent fixation
events along independent lineages. This implies that it
might be difficult to detect adaptive evolution in a relatively short time after radiation of closely related species,
and that fixation of species-specific replacements is
likely to be achieved only under strong positive selection
[22]. Because of these limits, for each positive selected
site detected by ML approaches (see below) the state of
character was carefully examined along the branches of
the gene-trees: caution was taken in interpreting the
inflated ω at some of these sites solely as an effect of a
long-term change in selective pressures, because shared
mutations more likely represented ancestral replacement

polymorphisms rather than multiple independent
substitutions.
Results of McDonald-Kreitman tests are shown in
Table 1. For all genes, the number of replacements
exceeded the number of synonymous substitutions at
polymorphic sites in almost all pairwise comparisons,
although this difference was not significant. The number
of fixed synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions
among species was very low for AGAP005194 and
AGAP005196, whereas in AGAP005195 a relatively high
number of fixed replacements was observed in pairwise
comparisons involving A. merus and A. melas. A significant p-value of MK test (p < 0.05) was only found for
AGAP005196 between A. gambiae and A. melas.
Recombination detection

The analysis using the GARD algorithm and the RDP
software did not detect any statistically significant
recombinant, or gene conversion among the three serine
protease genes.
Selection tests using ML approaches (PAML and HyPhy)

For AGAP005194 and AGAP005195, likelihood ratio
tests were significant for both model comparisons (M2
vs. M1 and M8 vs. M7) highlighting several sites with ω
values higher than 1. These positively selected sites were
identified by both NEB and BEB analyses (posterior
probability = 0.99) (Table 2). For AGAP005194, four
residues (i.e. 42, 43, 121, 161) were consistently identified by NEB and BEB of M8 and M2 models. The ω
ratios at these sites were > 1 (ω~5) in all cases, even
when considering the standard errors (S.E.) of estimates.
All HyPhy analyses indicated that site 42 is evolving
under positive selection; FEL also identified site 5, while
the results of REL were in accordance with those of
NEB and BEB. For AGAP005195 seven residues (i.e. 51,
93, 141, 157, 186, 199, 201) were identified by BEB and
NEB of M2 and M8 models. The ω ratios at these sites
were ~8-9 in all cases, also when considering the S.E. of
estimates. FEL, SLAC and REL identified residues 186,
199 and 201 as evolving under positive selection. For
AGAP005196, none of the comparisons among codon
models was significant using PAML. SLAC did not identify sites evolving under positive selection in this gene,
whereas FEL identified sites 67 and 109. Finally, the less
conservative REL method identified 13 positively
selected sites for this gene: 8, 16, 18, 37, 39, 59, 67, 81,
82, 94, 109, 113, 124.
The branch model tests applied to AGAP005194 dataset did not support episodic selection along any branch,
whereas it suggested a putative long-term positive selection scenario in A. merus, although the averaged ω value

tested for alternative hypotheses of selection (H1 and
H 2 ) in A. merus and A. melas. The branch model
applied to branches leading to A. melas and A. merus,
respectively, did not support positive selection. A longterm selection scenario, although not significant, showed
a better likelihood score (-1857.9950) with a mean ω =
1.38 for the foreground branches of the A. merus clade.
However, the branch-site test was highly significant

(using a p-value adjusted after Bonferroni’s correction,
Table 3) when applied to the branch leading to the
clade grouping A. melas and A. merus, and BEB identified one positively selected site (residue 71). In
AGAP005196 the branch model detected episodic selection along the branch separating the A. melas-like from
the A. gambiae-like groups (ω = 2.22, p < 0.05, see Figure 2c). The branch model performed using a gene-tree
reconstructed after excluding A. arabiensis and A.

quadriannulatus from the dataset also detected episodic
selection for the branch separating A. gambiae from the
other two species (ω = 2.14; p < 0.05). However, in both
cases, ω was not significantly > 1. The high ω along the
branch separating the A. gambiae- and A. melas- like
groups suggests that positive selection has been acting
on it; however, the p-value < 0.05 cannot be directly
interpreted as significant due to a lack of a priori specification of the foreground branches. As already pointed
out above, this result is probably affected by an overestimation of ω due to the presence of several segregating
replacements. In fact, although the presence of four
fixed replacements between the two groups (and the
absence of fixed synonymous substitutions along this
branch) is consistent with the hypothesis of positive
selection, other non-synonymous changes are shared at
10 out 34 sites (29%; synonymous changes at 2 out 24
sites, 8%) among the species/individuals belonging to
the two clusters on both sides of the branch. The most
parsimonious interpretation is that such replacements
represent ancestral polymorphisms rather than multiple
independent substitutions in different lineages, and this
likely affects the reliability of ω estimates.
The results of the branch-site tests were negative in all
cases, except when the branch leading to A. melas was
assigned as foreground on the gene tree obtained after
excluding A. arabiensis and A. quadriannulatus (p <
0.016 after Bonferroni’s correction), although BEB failed
to identify positive selective sites.
3D models

Our analysis indicates that AGAP005194, AGAP005195
and AGAP005196 are chymotrypsin-like serine proteases, a class of enzymes characterized by the presence
of a catalytic triad (Serine, Histidine and Aspartate
amino acids) and composed by two juxtaposed barrel
domains, with the catalytic residues bridging the barrels
[23-27]. Residues from N to C terminus of the protease
polypeptide substrate are usually named Pi, ..., P3, P2,
P1, P1’, P2’, P3’, ..., Pj. The cleavable bond is located
between P1 and P1’, P1 being the strongest specificity
determinant in the majority of the cases. The specificity
pocket and the oxyanion hole represent two essential
structural features of serine proteases. The former
recognizes the side chain of the P1 residue, whereas the
latter stabilizes the negative charge that develops on the
carboxyl oxygen of the substrate.
We analysed the specificity pocket of the three
enzymes (Figure 4 and Additional file 4). It can be
noticed that two particular positions in the specificity
pocket are strictly conserved in all proteases, namely a
glycine in position 189 (chymotrypsin numbering
scheme) and an aspartate in position 226. Even if the
other positions are more variable, a noticeably large

Page 8 of 18

hydrophobic residue is present in position 213 of all
proteases. This suggests that these enzymes may recognize a hydrophobic amino acid in P1, possibly a phenylalanine, which could fit into the pocket (data not
shown). Interestingly, AGAP005194 displays a bulky
aromatic residue (Phe) in position 213, whereas in the
same position both AGAP005195 and AGAP005196
have a smaller hydrophobic one (Val) (Figure 4d and
Additional file 4). This difference might in principle correspond to a different substrate preference of
AGAP005194 with respect to the other two proteases.
We next determined the position on the protease surface of the residues subjected to positive selection
(Figure 4a-c). Interestingly, most of them lie on the surface area of the protein containing the active site and,
even if their geometric distribution is rather different in
the three proteases, they surround the active site in two
out of three cases. By analyzing the distance distribution
of the positive-selected residues from the catalytic serine
and their position relatively to the catalytic triad, we
observed that 5 out of 7 residues in AGAP005194 and 4
out of 8 residues in AGAP005195 are within a close distance (< 15 Å) (Figure 4a,b). In particular, five sites
identified as evolving under selective pressures (Table 2
and 3) are in strategic locations: in fact, sites 43 and 48
in AGAP005194 and sites 71, 199 and 201 in
AGAP005195, lie on the edge of the specificity pocket
(Figure 4a,b). These sites could have an important role
in substrate recognition and/or binding. It is worth to
note that codon 71 of AGAP005195 has been identified
by the branch-site model as evolving under selective
pressures along the branch separating the A. melas and
A. merus clade from the other members of the A. gambiae complex. Finally, most of the 13 positively selected
residues identified for AGAP005196 appears to be “randomly” distributed in the protein structure (data not
shown). 4 of these residues (37, 39, 81, 82) are close to
each other and lie on the same protein face of the catalytic triad (Figure 4c) and among them 39, 81 and 82
are located near the edge of the specificity pocket. However, the putative high level of ancestral replacement
polymorphisms could have led to an overestimation of
ω by site-models for most of AGAP005196 positive
selected sites (see also Figure 3).
Immunofluorescence and confocal analysis

To gain further support for the hypothesis that the
atrium-expressed proteases are involved in the digestion
of the mating plug, we used polyclonal antibodies
against AGAP005194 in immunofluorescence (IF)
experiments on mating plugs dissected from recently
mated A. gambiae females. The IF experiments verified
that indeed this female protease is found on the surface
of the plug after mating (Figure 5a). Moreover, the

pattern of AGAP005194 on the plug surface closely
matched the pattern of Plugin, the major plug protein
(Figure 5a,b) [8]. We also confirmed that by 24 hours
post-mating just some traces of AGAP005194 protein
are left in the female atrium compared to virgin levels
(data not shown). All together, these data strongly suggest that AGAP005194 (and probably the other atrialspecific protease AGAP005195) is completely dedicated
to proteolytic activities related to copulation.

Discussion
Here we present data on a cluster of 3 female LRTspecific serine protease genes suggested to be involved
in post-mating processes in A. gambiae s.s. As already
shown for other genes with different functions, the
reconstruction of the 3 gene-trees shows that most species share alleles at all loci, as an effect of introgression
and/or retention of ancestral polymorphisms, and that
only A. merus and A. melas are placed in monophyletic
assemblages (Figure 2). On the other hand, we found an
unusually high substitution rate, which contributes
mostly to an exceptionally high level of intra-specific
polymorphisms, especially at nonsynonymous sites
(Table 1). Moreover, while A. gambiae, A. arabiensis,
and A. quadriannulatus do not differ for any fixed
replacement, A. melas and A. merus diverge from the
other species at all loci, showing a high number of fixed
substitutions at both synonymous (7-9) and nonsynonymous (13-23) sites at locus AGAP005195.
The comparisons of different site-models - used to
test for the presence of positively selected sites in our
codon alignments - indicate that in all 3 serine proteases
most amino acidic residues (75-87%) are conserved
among the species analysed and that these proteins are
overall subjected to purifying selection (SLAC global

d N /d S = 0.482, 0.672, 0.406 for AGAP005194,
AGAP005195, AGAP005196 respectively, see also figure
3). However, a number of codons appear to be targeted
by positive selective pressures in all genes (Tables 2 and
3) and, noteworthy, some of them lie relatively close to
the catalytic triad and/or on the edge of the specificity
pocket, which is considered to be important for substrate recognition and/or binding (Figure 4a-c).
Moreover, lineage-specific tests of adaptive evolution
detected events of episodic selection in AGAP005195
and AGAP005196. In the former gene, the branch-site
models detected episodic selection on lineages that were
not detected by branch-models, as expected if positive
selection occurs at a few sites in an overall purifying
selection background. In particular, codon 71 is shown
to have evolved under selective pressures along the
branch separating the clade grouping A. melas and
A. merus from the other members of the A. gambiae
complex. These two species are grouped apart also on
the basis of other substitutions at positions 51, 52, 70,
72, 107, 157 and 193. Among them, sites 51 and 157
were also detected by BEB analysis of site-model comparisons (Table 1). It is worth to note that most of these
residues are exposed to the solvent and form a sort of
semi-circle around the active site (Figure 4b), suggesting
that this epitope might interact with a peculiar substrate
in A. melas and A. merus. It can be hypotesized that
this epitope evolved under selective pressures in a common ancestor of these two species, or, alternatively,
because of convergent evolution. The latter hypothesis
would be consistent with the distant phylogenetic relationship between these two species, as suggested by
their chromosomal inversions patterns [11,28]. In addition, we found A. merus- (13, 36, 104, 105, 152, 155,
159, 160, 165, 183, 199) and A. melas- (152, 181)

Mancini et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:72
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/72

specific replacements: among them, residues in position
152, 155, 159 and 199 (the last identified by all ML
selection methods) on the same protein side of the catalytic triad, while the remaining residues are located in
exposed loops in regions far from it (not shown in Figure 4). Follow up molecular studies will be needed to
clarify whether AGAP005195 has evolved a different
role in A. melas and A. merus as opposed to the other
species of the complex.
In AGAP005196, the branch model detected episodic
selection along the branch separating the A. melas-like
from the A. gambiae-like alleles, and along the branch
leading to A. melas. In both cases, the ω assigned to
these branches (assumed to be the same at all sites) was
not significantly >1. On the contrary, the branch-site
test applied to the branch leading to A. melas was statistically significant, but BEB failed to identify sites under
positive selection. Finally, a significant excess of fixed
replacements between A. gambiae and A. melas was also
detected by the MK-test for this gene (Table 1).
The interpretation of the results obtained is not
straightforward, with particular reference to those from
the models of episodic selection. As already mentioned,
the occurrence in AGAP005196 of relatively high frequencies of nonsynonymous mutations at both intraand inter-specific levels may affect the interpretation of
evidence of episodic selection along the branch leading
to A. melas. In addition, although A. melas presents
four species-specific amino acid replacements at positions 2, 88, 110, 129 (which also contribute to the significance of MK test in the comparison with A. gambiae),
these are shared with some A. arabiensis and A. quadriannulatus individuals, thus revealing again a pattern of
incomplete lineage sorting also for this particular
haplotype.
Increased dN/dS among conspecifics (or among closely
related sequences/species) has been observed in other
taxa, and a variety of hypotheses has been suggested to
interpret these results under a regime of negative selection: balancing selection, variable population sizes, variable mutation rates, relaxed selective constraints and/or
the prevalence of slightly deleterious mutations [19,20].
Based on our data, we cannot rule out any of these
hypotheses, nor provide an unambiguous explanation for
the observed pattern. However, the high level of replacement polymorphisms observed in all the 3 serine proteases (Table 1) suggests that these genes might evolve as
a functionally redundant cluster. In fact, duplicated genes
with partially or completely overlapping functions may
experience relaxed evolutionary constraints that allow
them to rapidly explore and eventually fix new advantageous variants [29-31]. Indeed, in some Drosophila species, female-expressed serine proteases have experienced
recurrent events of lineage-specific gene duplications

Page 11 of 18

immediately followed by a period of positive selection,
indicating neo-functionalization of gene duplicates
[32,33]. Evidence of recent duplication activity playing a
crucial role also in the evolution of Anopheles female
proteases is provided by the finding of an additional copy
of AGAP005196 located in the same gene cluster. This
previously undetected paralog bears the insertion of a
miniature transposable element of the TA-I-a-Ag MITE
family, which is frequently associated with gene introns
and putatively affects gene regulation [17,34]. If we
assume that the A. gambiae serine-protease cluster is
experiencing relaxed evolutionary constraints, the
decrease of dN/dS observed only at increasing evolutionary distances in all 3 proteases (Figure 3) may simply
reflect a lag in removal of slightly-deleterious mutations
by purifying selection occurring in the early stages of
sequence differentiation. This could, for instance, explain
the ω >>1 observed for most A. merus intra-specific comparisons in AGAP005194 (Figure 3), which could alternatively be interpreted also as the result of long-term
positive selective pressures in this species (Table 3). The
latter interpretation is consistent with the observation
that some A. merus-specific polymorphic replacements
(i.e. 42 and 43, identified by M2 and M8) map close to
the catalytic triad (Figure 4a), although some of them are
also shared with other species (e.g. A. quadriannulatus).
Hence, a better knowledge on the functional importance
of these non-synonymous changes would be needed to
evaluate if balancing selection is maintaining different
haplogroups at intermediate frequencies in the A. merus
gene pool.
In addition, we cannot exclude that genetic drift
caused by long-term small effective population sizes of
A. melas and A. merus might have also contributed to
determine the observed fixation of species-specific substitutions (and, therefore, lineage-sorting). Indeed, it has
been argued by many authors that coalescence processes and demographic fluctuations have differently
affected and shaped the population genetic history of
members of the A. gambiae complex [35-38]. Since πs
can be used as an estimator of 4Neμ, assuming the
same mutation rate (μ) in all lineages, differences at
neutral sites at the AGAP005195 locus would indicate
that A. gambiae and A. arabiensis have experienced larger effective population sizes than A. merus, consistently
both with their wider geographic range and their higher
levels of shared ancestral polymorphisms (see above:
πs ~ 1.7%, 0.4%, and 0.0% for A. gambiae, A. arabiensis
and A. merus, respectively). A similar explanation could
be applied to the four species-specific replacements
found in A. melas at the AGAP005196 locus and
indeed, under the same assumption, πs would indicate
that A. gambiae and A. arabiensis have experienced larger effective population sizes than A. melas (πs ~1.9%,

Mancini et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:72
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/72

2.8%, and 0.1% for A. gambiae, A. arabiensis and
A. melas, respectively).
Difficulties in the interpretation of results from selection-tests are mostly due to the unresolved phylogenetic
history of the A. gambiae complex, as already argued for
genes modulating immune responses to the malaria parasites [15,35,39-43]. However, the accurate inferences of
the structural models of these proteins allowed us to better evaluate the importance of these putative positive
selected residues. It is worth to note that most positive
selected residues appear not located “at random” on 3D
structures. In particular, the structural models show that
AGAP005194 and AGAP005195 positive selected residues are placed in a relatively large surface area near the
catalytic triad and in the specificity pocket (Figure 4).
A similar pattern was also observed for duplicated genes
encoding several mating-induced female serine proteases
of Drosophila [32,33,44-47], which are supposed to interact with rapidly evolving accessory gland proteins transferred by males during mating [48-50]. Sexual selection
and/or conflict due to male-female protein interactions
have been considered to be responsible for these patterns
in Drosophila and to have promoted rapid divergence,
which in some cases has been found to be ten-fold higher
than in genes expressed in non-reproductive tissues [46].
However, in the case of the monandrous species of the
A. gambiae complex, sexual selection and/or conflict cannot be convincingly invoked to explain the presence of
positive selected sites near the catalytic triad or in the
specificity pocket. A more likely explanation could be
that the observed pattern is derived from the interaction
of the 3 female-specific proteases with rapidly evolving
substrates or inhibitors that may differently modulate
their catalytic activity. This scenario mirrors the rapid
evolution of immune-related genes engaged in hostpathogen arms race (see ref. 35 and reference therein).
Indeed, in Drosophila females sexually antagonistic interactions at the time of mating activate a number of
immune-related genes, which are induced by the transfer
of sperm and seminal fluid peptides, rather than by
pathogens [51]. It has been suggested that this immune
response could account for the ‘cost of mating’, in the
form of decreased female lifespan and fecundity [51].
Although in A. gambiae no significant induction of known
immune genes was detected after mating and no cost of
mating has ever been reported, some genes encoding
immune-like peptides were shown to be strongly upregulated in the female atrium [14]. It could be hypothesized
that the three serine proteases studied here have a dual
role in Anopheles fertility: helping the preservation of the
female reproductive tract from possible damaging factors
transferred during mating, and processing of the mating
plug. In effect, a dual role could be hypothesized for
AGAP005194: this protease has been found to respond to

Page 12 of 18

bacterial infection [52] and its role in processing the mating plug is confirmed by its localization on the plug surface (Figure 5). Given the strong down-regulation of the 3
serine proteases at 24 h post mating, it is reasonable to
speculate that their transcription may be turned down by
male-derived factors released during mating plug digestion, thereby reducing the cost of mating and allowing
females to entirely divert their energy resources to reproductive processes. This hypothesis would be more consistent with a co-operation between the sexes in optimizing
their reproductive success, rather than with an arms race
among sexes.
The relaxation in purifying selection provided by the
functional redundancy in the cluster would allow the
maintenance of high genetic variability, on which positive selection could act to eventually fix novel variants
to perform either new or more specific functions (neofunctionalization) [29]. In fact, the 3D models highlighted an important structural differentiation in the
two atrium-specific proteases AGAP005194 and
AGAP005195 that might have a different substrate
preference (Figure 4d and Additional file 4). This differentiation, due to a bulky aromatic residue (Phe) in
position 213 of AGAP005194 respect to a smaller
hydrophobic one (Val) in AGAP005195 and AGAP
005196, is fixed in all species of the A. gambiae complex and thus likely appeared very early during the
evolution of the paralogs, probably because of neofunctionalization. The relative high differentiation (3550% identity on PEST genome ver. 3.5, Sept. 2009) and
the absence of gene conversion among the three paralogs (except for the ‘recent’ copy of AGAP005196
bearing the MITE insertion) indicate that these are not
at their very early stages of duplication in the A. gambiae complex. In this context, it would be important to
obtain more information on the conservation of gene
linkage (synteny) for this cluster of functionally related
genes in species more distant to those within the A.
gambiae complex. Interestingly, a comparative study of
gene orders between A. gambiae and A. stephensi at
~1 Mb resolution did not detect a conserved synteny
block for the chromosome region containing these
serine protease genes [53]. Furthermore, the order
of these genes was inverted (if not reshuffled) in
A. stephensi because of the accumulation of a large
number of fixed inversions during the divergence of
the two species. Novel data from the ongoing genome
sequencing project from 13 more Anopheles species
will provide a better knowledge on the orthology and
synteny of these genes and, hopefully, a stable phylogenetic framework to trace the evolution of relevant
amino acid substitutions in copies of this gene cluster.
These data would also help validating the findings of
other ‘novelties’ such as fixed autapomorphic and

Mancini et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:72
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/72

synapomorphic replacements located in strategic positions close to the catalytic triad of the 3 proteases,
which suggests an interaction with factors transferred
by males (e.g. substrates, inhibitors or pathogens) that
may have differently evolved in independent A. gambiae lineages. In addition, the spermatheca-specific
protease AGAP005196, because of its relative low
divergence among members of the A. gambiae complex, is likely to have appeared more recently than the
other copies with functions partially or completely
overlapping with those of AGAP005195. Indeed, preliminary data show that a number of seminal proteins
are transferred to the spermatheca bound on sperm
(Catteruccia F., personal communication), as it has
been shown in Drosophila [54]. It is possible that
AGAP005196 is also experiencing relaxed evolutionary
constraints that allow the accumulation of mutations
not tolerated in the previous selective regime and that
might be responsible for its adaptation to substrates
present in a novel reproductive tissue (i.e. the spermatheca). This is consistent with the observation that
A. melas-specific sites 88 and 129 are located nearby
the edge of the specificity pocket and might play a role
in substrate recognition and/or binding (Figure 4c).

Conclusions
To summarize our results, we found i) an unusually
high level of replacement polymorphisms, ii) evidence of
a recent gene duplication activity, iii) species/group-specific fixed replacements, iv) sites evolving under longterm and episodic positive selection, v) structural differences among proteases putatively affecting their substrate specificity and, vi) additional evidence of a direct
role of these proteases in mating plug digestion.
Overall, our data unveil an unexpectedly intricate evolutionary scenario for these 3 Anopheles femaleexpressed serine proteases. Unfortunately, as already
remarked, the intricated phylogenetic history of the
A. gambiae complex hinder the interpretation of our
results from selection-inference methods. Nevertheless,
the 3D structure study of these proteins allowed us to
highlight a closeness of most of positive selected sites to
the catalytic triad and/or to the edge of the specificity
pocket. Thus, despite the possible presence of false positives in site-based tests of selection, the identification of
replacements in amino acid positions that are crucial for
the activity of these proteases (especially if maintained
by long-term balancing selection at least in some species) encourages further investigation on the role of
these residues in substrate recognition or binding in
Anopheles female serine proteases.
Further experimental analyses in the other species of
the A. gambiae complex will be also needed to assess
whether the patterns of evolution observed for these

Page 13 of 18

proteins might correlate to diverse biological functions.
If a relevant role of the 3 serine proteases in the reproductive success of A. gambiae species will be
highlighted, this would open perspectives for the development of innovative strategies aimed at limiting the
fertility of these mosquitoes, and ultimately contribute
to control malaria transmission.

Methods
Field collected samples

Evolutionary analyses were carried out on 5 species of
the A. gambiae complex. Samples of both incipient species of A. gambiae s.s. - namely the M- and S- molecular forms - were considered in our study. Sampling on a
wide geographic scale was planned to increase the
power to distinguish between polymorphisms and fixed
differences among species. Specimens were collected in
several localities along the geographical distribution of
each species (Additional file 5): A. gambiae s.s. M- and
S-form adults were collected between 1998 and 2008 in
6 African countries (Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Ivory
Coast, Tanzania, Zimbabwe), A. arabiensis from 5 countries (Senegal, The Gambia, Angola, Zimbabwe and
Kenya), A. melas from Angola, Gabon and Guinea
Bissau, A. quadriannulatus A from Zimbabwe and
Malawi and A. merus from Mozambique and Tanzania.
Sequences of AGAP005194, AGAP005195 and AGAP
005196 genes were obtained from a total of 51, 48 and
61 individuals, respectively (8, 7 and 7 for A. gambiae
M-form; 9, 11 and 11 for A. gambiae S-form; 10, 8 and
15 for A. arabiensis; 7, 7 and 8 for A. quadriannulatus;
8, 9 and 12 for A. melas; 7, 6 and 8 for A. merus). Species names are abbreviated as follows: A. arabiensis =
AR; A. gambiae M form = GA-M; A. gambiae S form =
GA-S; A. melas = ML; A. merus = MR; A. quadriannulatus A = QD.
DNA methods

Genomic DNA was extracted using standard procedures
and specimens were identified to species/forms using
both PCR-RFLP and SINE200 methods [55,56]. Primers
were designed using Primer3 program [57] in order to
amplify part (~700-900 bp) of AGAP005194, AGAP
005195 and AGAP005196 loci (Figure 1). To successfully amplify the targeted portions, a nested PCR protocol was applied in most cases: the PCR products
obtained in the first round were diluted 1:100 and used
as templates for subsequent PCR reactions with internal
primers (Additional file 6). PCR were performed in a
25 μl reaction which contained 1 pmol of each primer,
0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1x reaction buffer, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 2.5 U Taq polymerase (Bioline), and 0.5-1.0 μl of
template DNA extracted from head and torax of a single
mosquito. Thermocycler conditions were: 94°C for

Mancini et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:72
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/72

10 min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec., 50-54°
C for 30 sec. and 72°C for 1 min., with final elongation
at 72°C for 10 min. The resulting products were analysed on 1% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide,
purified using the SureClean Kit (Bioline) and sequenced
at the BMR Genomics s.r.l. (Padua, Italy). Sequences
were deposited in GenBank under Accession Numbers
HQ332601-HQ332768.
Sequence editing and codon alignments

All sequences were edited using the Staden Package ver.
2003.1.6 [58]. Haplotype estimation was performed with
the PHASE algorithm [59] implemented in DNAsp v5
[60]. After removing introns, codon alignments were
recovered from each protein using MAFFT ver. 5 [61].
To test for gene conversion, we also built multiple
codon alignments including alleles sampled from all loci
and only merging AGAP005195 and AGAP005196
alignments (see below).
Polymorphisms, divergence and tree inferences

Basic analyses of genetic polymorphisms and divergence
were performed using DnaSP v5 [60]. A bayesian phylogenetic approach was used to infer gene-tree topologies
that also served as the basis for the implementation of
the maximum likelihood methods of the PAML package
ver. 4.3 [62]. The nucleotide substitution models were
selected using jModeltest 0.1.1 [63] according to the
Akaike Information Criterion for small sample size
(AICc) and then used for bayesian inferences on complete and reduced datasets of coding regions using Mr
Bayes ver. 3.1.2 [64]. 2.0 × 106 generations were run and
Markov chains were sampled every 1000 generations.
To ensure sampling of topologies after chain convergence, the first 1000 trees were discarded as ‘burnin’
and the remaining trees were used to compute posterior
probabilities at nodes. Since introgression and/or retention of ancestral polymorphisms are common in the
reconstruction of genealogical relationships among the
species of the A. gambiae complex [37,65,66], the genealogical sorting index (gsi) [67] was used to quantify the
exclusive ancestry of alleles sampled from each species/
form of the A. gambiae complex on the reconstructed
gene trees. Statistical significance of gsi values were
assessed using 10000 permutations, as implemented in
the web server http://www.genealogicalsorting.org/.
Tests for adaptive evolution

In order to assess patterns of adaptive evolution on each
gene, different approaches were used. The synonymous
(dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) substitution rates were
computed using the codon-based model of Goldman and
Yang [18] for each pairwise comparison, as implemented
in the Yn00 program of PAML 4.3 [62]. The ratio of

Page 14 of 18

dN/dS (= ω) was also calculated for each comparison:
under neutrality ω = 1; for genes subjected to functional
constraints such that deleterious nonsynonymous amino
acid substitutions are purged from the population ω < 1,
while for positively selected genes ω >1. This approach
can be used to describe the general pattern of selection
on a protein, but, since it averages ω over sites and time,
it has little power if only a few sites have been targets of
adaptive evolution [68].
McDonald-Kreitman (MK) tests [69] were performed
for each gene to identify selection on the whole protein
through an excess of fixed amino acid substitutions
between species. This test compares the number of nonsynonymous and synonymous sites that are polymorphic
within a species (PNS and PS) and fixed between species
(FNS and FS). Under neutrality PNS/PS = FNS/FS, whereas
positive selection leads to an increase in nonsynonymous fixed divergence (FNS/FS > PNS/PS). Statistical significance of MK tests was assessed with DNAsp 5 [60]
using the Fisher’s exact test.
Maximum likelihood (ML) approaches, which allow ω
to vary among codons, were used to perform a site-bysite detection of positive selection. For this purpose,
codon alignments and tree topologies were used as
input in CodeML of the PAML 4.3 [62]. Two pairs of
site models forming two likelihood ratio tests of positive
selection (i.e. M1a vs. M2a, and M7 vs. M8) were fitted
to our data. In the first comparison, a nearly neutral
model (M1a) allowing only two categories of sites with
ω = 1 and 0 < ω < 1, respectively, was compared with a
selection model (M2a), which allows an additional category of positively selected sites (i.e. ω > 1). In a second
test, the M7 model (beta), that allows sites to have different ω estimated from a beta distribution and varying
in the interval (0, 1), was compared with an alternative
selection model, M8 (beta and ω), which allows to add
another category of ω that accounts for positively
selected sites (ω > 1). Likelihood ratio tests were used to
determine the relative fit of these hierarchically nested
models using 2 d.f. (e.g., if M1a/M7 (neutral) can be
rejected in favor of M2a/M8 (selection), positive selection is inferred). If tests were significant, the Naïve
Empirical Bayes (NEB) and the Bayes Empirical Bayes
(BEB) were applied to calculate the posterior probabilities for site classes, and, thus, to identify sites putatively
evolving under positive selection.
Branch models of CodeML - that allow ω to vary
among branches in a tree - were applied to detect selection acting on a particular lineage. To test for episodic
selection (’H1 hypothesis’), we designated each branch
leading to monophyletic lineages in our trees as foreground branches (i.e. the branch of interest) and branch
model 2 (NSsites = 2, model = 0, allowing a free ω for
the foreground branch) was compared to branch model

Mancini et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:72
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/72

0 (NSsites = 0, model = 0, one ω for all branches, ‘H0
hypothesis’) to test if ω along the foreground branches
were significantly larger compared to the ω along all
other branches. To test an alternative pattern of longterm change in selective pressures within specific
lineages (’H2 hypothesis’), we also labeled all branches in
a clade as foreground and evaluated the fit of this model
to our data.
In order to test if certain codons were under selection
in the foreground branches, and thus identify positively
selected sites within specific monophyletic lineages in
our trees, we also fit the branch-site models. This
method can be useful when selective pressures change
over time at just a fraction of sites. This test was performed by comparing the modified Model A (model =
2; NSsites = 2) with the corresponding null model, i.e.
Model A1 with ω2 fixed to 1. In this case, the BEB procedure was used to identify positively selected codons in
the foreground branches. Bonferroni’s procedure was
used to control the family-wise error rate (≤ 0.5%) and
correct for multiple testing, as it has been shown to be
powerful when the branch-site test is applied without a
priori hypothesis to multiple branches on a tree [70].
Three additional methods based on ML approach and
implemented in HyPhy Datamonkey webserver (URL:
http://www.datamonkey.org) [71] were used to compare
results with those obtained using CodeML. As in
CodeML, these methods, namely the SLAC, FEL and
REL methods [71] are based on a site-by-site analysis
aimed to identify single aminoacids under positive selection. However, in contrast to CodeML models, these
methods estimate dS at each codon site, thus taking
into account synonymous rate variation among sites.
The starting trees that served as the basis for the HyPhy
analyses were inferred automatically by the program
itself. We chose a significance level of 0.1 for FEL and
SLAC methods and a Bayes Factor = 50 for REL
analysis.
Recombination analyses

Site-by-site ML methods implemented in CodeML
assume no recombination among sequences. As a consequence, in case of recombination, false evidence of positive selection might arise using these methods [72]. The
same effect occurs in case of gene conversion among
loci in a gene cluster [73]. Then, we tested for recombination (and gene conversion) in our datasets by: i) a
scan for recombination using the 7 methods implemented in the RDP3 software [74] using default settings (i.e.
RDP, Bootscanning, GENECONV, MaxChi, Chimaera,
SiScan, 3SEQ), ii) the Genetic Algorithm Recombination
Detection (GARD) method implemented in the Web
interface of HyPhy Datamonkey [75].

Generation of 3D protein models

The 3D models of the three proteases were built using
comparative modelling techniques and employing the
complete sequence derived from the A. gambiae genome. In order to build reliable homology models and
analyze the structural context of residues under selective
pressures, we used the HHpred web-server (http://
toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/hhpred) [76] to identify suitable templates and obtain their sequence alignment with
the target protease protein sequences. This tool is based
on the comparison of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
describing the family of the target proteins with HMMs
built for each protein of known structure. For each target, the ProMals3D tool [77] was used to optimize the
target-template alignment which was then used as input
for the Modeller package [78]; Modeller uses distance
constraints derived from the template(s) to build consistent models of the target protein. We decided to generate 50 models for each target protein.
For AGAP005194 HHpred identified three proteins of
known structure as best templates: fire ant chymotrypsin, PDB code: 1eq9, sequence identity 38%, E-value less
than 1.4E-45 [79], fiddler crab collagenase, PDB code:
1azz, sequence identity 31%, E-value < 1.4E-45) [80] and
crayfish trypsin, PDB code: 2f91, sequence identity 32%,
E-value < 1.4E- -45 ) [81]. The best templates for
AGAP005195 were fire ant chymotrypsin (sequence
identity 36%, E-value < 1.4E -45 ) [79] and fiddler crab
collagenase (sequence identity 28%, E-value < 1.4E -45)
[80]. One template was identified for AGAP005196, i.e.
fire ant chymotrypsin, PDB code: 1eq9 (sequence identity 28%, E-value < 1.4E -46 ) [79]. The 50 models
obtained for each target protein were ranked first
according to the Modeller Objective Function and then
to the Modeller DOPE scoring function [82]. The best
10 models in each ranked set were evaluated using the
ProQ server [83] and, finally, the ProQ best five models
re-evaluated using the MQAP MetaServer [84]. The
MQAP best scoring model was selected as the final one.
Three-dimensional analysis and visualization were carried out using the VMD (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/
Research/vmd/) and PyMol software tools (http://www.
pymol.org/). Notice that the target-template sequence
identity ranged between 28% (AGAP005196-1eq9) and
38% (AGAP005194-1eq9) and that the most effective
methods for protein structure prediction (HHPred followed by model building with Modeller) was used. In
recent blind tests in the context of the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction
(CASP), this strategy revealed to be extremely effective
(http://predictioncenter.org). In our specific case, it
guarantees that the expected difference between the
models and the real structure of the proteins is of the

Mancini et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:72
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/72

order of 0.5 - 1.0 Å root mean square deviation on the
main chain atoms of the conserved regions. This implies
that the unavoidable deviations of the models from the
native structures would not significantly affect the position of the specificity pocket residues and, therefore,
would not alter the conclusions of our structural
analysis.
Immunostaining and confocal analysis of mating plug

Mating plugs from recently mated A. gambiae females
were dissected on ice and fixed in PBS 4% formaldehyde
solution. After washing in PBS, the samples were incubated with 2% hydrogen peroxide to reduce autofluorescence, washed in PBS and then blocked and permeabilized
in PBS with 1% BSA and 0.03% Triton X-100. Then the
samples were incubated with 1.5 μg/ml anti-AGAP005194
in blocking buffer, washed, incubated with 2 μg/ml antiPlugin [8], washed and finally stained with anti-mouse
Alexa 488 and anti-rabbit Cy3 (Invitrogen) at a 1:1,000
dilution. Tissues were then mounted in DAPI-containing
Vectashield medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and visualized using a Leica SP5 inverted confocal microscope.
Affinity-purified polyclonal antibody against AGAP00
5194 was raised in mouse against a peptide epitope
(CGTSPAKLQTINAPS) by a commercial supplier (GenScript Corp., Piscataway, NJ).
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)

To understand whether AGAP005196 and the novel
identified paralog of AGAP005196 with the MITE insertion are clustered together (see Results), we designed a
557 bp probe [using primers RG5196-FISH-f (5’ACGGG
TGGGAACAAATGATA3’) and RG5196-FISH-r1
(5’CCAACTGACTACGCCAACCT3’)] that included
partial sequences of AGAP005196 exons 2 and 4, as
well as full sequences of exon 3 and introns 2 and 3.
Because the MITE was found within intron 3 of the
paralog gene, this probe binds predominantly to the
common sequences (intron 2 and exon 3) of both
AGAP005196 and its paralog. In order to ensure that
the presence of the MITE did not interfere with the
overall efficiency of the binding, we designed an additional 426 bp probe [using as alternative reverse primer
RG5196-FISH-r2 (5’ACCATGCCCTGCTCTAGAAA3’)]
that included partial sequences of exons 2 and 3, as well
as a full sequence of intron 2, but not the third intron.
The genomic DNA of single A. gambiae SUA mosquitoes was extracted with the Wizard SV Genomic Purification System (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI,
USA) and used as a template for PCR. PCR products
were gel purified using the Geneclean kit (Qbiogene,
Inc., Irvine, CA). Chromosomal preparations were made
from the ovaries of half-gravid females of the SUA strain
of A. gambiae, the OPHANSI strain of A. merus, and

Page 16 of 18

the DONGOLA strain of A. arabiensis. The in situ
hybridization procedure was conducted as previously
described [85]. The DNA was labeled with Cy3-AP3dUTP (GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Buckinghamshire, England) using Random Primers DNA Labeling System
(Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA). DNA
probes were hybridized to the chromosomes at 39°C
overnight in hybridization solution (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Then the chromosomes were
washed in 0.2 × SSC (Saline-Sodium Citrate: 0.03 M
Sodium Chloride, 0.003 M Sodium Citrate), counterstained with YOYO-1, and mounted in DABCO. Fluorescent signals were detected and recorded using a Zeiss
LSM 510 Laser Scanning Microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY, USA).
