Abstract
Background: Plexins are a family of transmembrane proteins that were shown to act as receptors
for Semaphorins either alone or in a complex together with Neuropilins. Based on structural
criteria Plexins were subdivided into 4 classes, A through D. PlexinAs are mainly thought to act as
mediators of repulsive signals in cell migration and axon guidance. Their functional role in
vertebrates has been studied almost exclusively in the context of Semaphorin signaling, i.e. as coreceptors for class 3 Semaphorins. Much less is known about Plexins of the other three classes.
Despite the fact that Plexins are involved in the formation of neuronal circuits, the temporal
changes of their expression patterns during development of the nervous system have not been
analyzed in detail.
Results: Only seven plexins are found in the chicken genome in contrast to mammals, where nine
plexins have been identified. Here, we describe the dynamic expression patterns of all known plexin
family members in comparison to the neuropilins in the developing chicken spinal cord.
Conclusion: Our in situ hybridization study revealed that the expression patterns of plexins and
neuropilins are only partially overlapping, especially during early and intermediate stages of spinal
cord development, supporting both cooperative and separate functions of plexins and neuropilins
in neural circuit formation.

Background
The formation of neuronal circuits crucially depends on
the correct navigation of axons to their target areas, where
they contact individual target cells to establish synaptic
contacts. Axonal navigation is based on sequential growth
from choice point to choice point. Pathfinding decisions
at choice points and along the axonal trajectory are the
consequence of molecular interactions between guidance

cues presented by the environment and guidance receptors expressed on the growth cones. A multitude of in vitro
and in vivo approaches led to the identification of guidance cues that provide directional information for the
navigation of growth cones. The Semaphorins are a structurally diverse family of guidance cues. They are subdivided into eight subfamilies, two found in invertebrates,
one in viruses, and five in vertebrates. Initially, Sema-

phorins were found to be repellents for extending axons.
In 1997, Neuropilins were identified as receptors for Semaphorins concurrently in two labs [1-3]; reviewed in [4]. A
short time later, a role for Plexins as receptors for Semaphorins was described [5-9]. However, Neuropilins and
Plexins had been discovered many years earlier as antigens of monoclonal antibodies raised against proteins
from the optic tectum of Xenopus laevis [10-12]. In contrast
to Neuropilins, which have only been found in vertebrates, Plexins are distributed widely in both vertebrates
and invertebrates [13]. The nine Plexins found in vertebrates have been subdivided into four subclasses A-D
depending on structural criteria. The largest subfamily is
the PlexinA subfamily with four members, followed by
the PlexinB subfamily with three members. Subfamilies C
and D contain only one member each.

described, but little is known about the role of PlexinBs in
vivo [26,28]. PlexinC1 was demonstrated to interact with
Sema7A [7], although the only functional study available
to date indicates Integrins rather than PlexinC1 as the
function-mediating receptor for Sema7A [29]. PlexinD1
finally was linked to the development of the heart and the
vascular system consistent with its predominant expression in endothelial cells [30-32].
As a step toward a better understanding of the diverse
roles of Plexins in the developing nervous system, we
decided to assess the expression patterns of plexins. Here,
we describe the expression of all plexins found in the
chicken genome during spinal cord development in comparison with neuropilins.

Results
By far the best-studied Plexins are class-A Plexins [14-16].
Their function has been studied predominantly in context
of their role as co-receptors (together with Neuropilins)
for secreted class-3 Semaphorins [14,16,17]. However,
PlexinAs must have functions that are independent of
Neuropilins, because they are expressed much more
widely in the developing nervous system than Neuropilin1 and -2. Consistent with this, Plexins were shown to
mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion in a calciumdependent manner [11]. Furthermore, PlexinAs were
shown to mediate effects of membrane-bound class-6
Semaphorins in a Neuropilin-independent manner
[18,19].
Until recently, when Sema3E binding to PlexinD1 in a
Neuropilin-independent manner was demonstrated during the development of the intersomitic vasculature [20],
Neuropilins were thought to be required but not sufficient
for class-3 Semaphorin signaling [8,9,21-23]. No signaling component in the cytoplasmic part of Neuropilins
could be identified, suggesting that they confer ligand specificity to the complex formed with Plexins, L1, or Offtrack [24,25]. In contrast to the secreted class-3 Semaphorins, membrane-associated Semaphorins were shown
to bind to Plexins directly [18,19,26,27].
Much less is known about the function of other classes of
plexins. An interaction of PlexinB1 with Sema4D has been

The avian genome lacks homologues for two mammalian
plexins
In order to identify chicken plexins and neuropilins we
performed extensive databank searches using the combined information from the BBSRC ChickEST and the
genomic database. These searches indicate that the
chicken genome encodes a reduced number of plexins
compared to mammals, i.e. only seven instead of nine.
While homologous chicken genes for the two unique subfamily members plexinC1 and plexinD1 could readily be
identified, fewer chicken plexinAs and plexinBs are
present in the chicken genome when compared to mammals (Table 1; Figure 1; [33]). The plexinA subfamily contains no matching chicken sequence for plexinA3.
Furthermore, no counterpart for plexinB3 could be
extracted from chicken databases (Figure 1 and Table 1).
Interestingly, the mouse variants of the two missing plexin
genes are located on the X chromosome, implying that a
homologous region of this chromosome is absent in
chicken. Birds use a Z/W sex determination system instead
of the X/Y system found in mammals. Moreover, in contrast to mammals, in chicken the female is the heterogametic sex (ZW), whereas the male is homogametic (ZZ),
further suggesting that intense chromosomal rearrangements happened during evolutionary development [34].
These changes are also reflected by the fact that the haploid chicken genome contains 38 autosomes compared to
only 19 autosomes in mouse [33,35]. Based on the align-

rons are born in the ventral spinal cord and start to extend
axons. The first plexins detected in motor neurons were
plexinA1 and A2 (Figure 2, compare [Additional file 1] for
sense controls). In addition, motor neurons expressed
neuropilin-1 (npn-1), but not npn-2. When compared
with markers for precursors and mature neurons (Figure
3), respectively, plexinA1 and A2 were clearly expressed
already in precursors of motor neurons, whereas npn-1
was restricted to more lateral, mature motor neurons.

ment of human, mouse, and chicken chromosomes,
genes found on the mammalian X chromosomes were
assigned either to the chicken chromosome 1 or 4 [33].
The chicken genome with 1.2 Ã 109 bp is only about 40%
as long as the human genome, and with an estimated
20'000 to 23'000 genes the chicken contains fewer genes
than the mouse or the human genome, although the difference in gene number is not proportional to the reduction in genome size. The chicken genome contains
markedly less repetitive sequence and a reduced number
of degraded copies of gene sequence, but also fewer duplicated copies of genes overall [33]. Thus, our finding that
two plexins are missing is most likely due to their actual
absence in the genome rather than our inability to detect
them in the databases. Moreover, all attempts to clone the
missing chicken homologues using degenerate primers
for RT-PCR failed, again implying that the missing genes
are indeed not represented in the chicken genome.
Interestingly, while conservation between different
chicken plexinAs was in the range of 70 to 90%, depending on the plexin parts used for alignment, conservation
between chicken plexinBs was only around 50% (Table
2). This value is not much higher than the values obtained
when plexinBs were compared to plexins in other subclasses, suggesting that although placed into the same
subclass, plexinB1 and B2 might actually be members of
different subclasses.
The expression patterns of plexins are dynamically
regulated during early spinal cord development
We started to analyze plexin expression in the lumbosacral spinal cord at stage 18 [36]. At this time, motor neu-

More dorsally, plexinA1, A2, and B1 were expressed in
Pax6-positive precursor cells (compare to Figure 3A). In
addition, cells in the dorsal spinal cord expressed
plexinA1, A2, B1, as well as npn-2 (Figure 2). These cells
expressed Pax7 (Figure 3D) but did not express neurofilament proteins (Figure 3E) and therefore represent precursors of dorsal interneurons [37]. At the lumbosacral level
of the spinal cord, dorsal commissural neurons derived
from these Pax7-positive precursors and characterized by
the expression of the cell adhesion molecule Axonin-1
start to extend axons at stage 19 (Figure 3F; [38]). These
axons grow toward the floor plate in response to chemoattractants derived from the floor plate, Netrin-1 (reviewed
in [39]) and Sonic hedgehog [40]. The majority of these
axons have reached the floor plate by stage 22. At this
stage, dorsal commissural neurons identified by axonin-1
expression [38,41] expressed all three members of the
plexinA class but neither npn-1 nor npn-2 (Figure 4; compare [Additional file 2] for sense controls). Interestingly,
plexinA1 and A2 were now also expressed in the floor
plate, although plexinA1 was found only in lateral but not
medial floor-plate cells (Figure 5). Furthermore, the floor
plate was also the earliest site of plexinB1 and C1 expression in the spinal cord (Figure 4 and 5). In contrast to all
other plexins, plexinB1 was expressed strongly in the
entire ventricular zone and at low levels in almost all cells
of the spinal cord at stage 22 and later.
Motor neurons innervating the hindlimb express a large
variety of plexins and neuropilins
After stage 22, motor axons reach the plexus region where
they have to sort out according to their target muscles.
While the first decision is primarily a choice to grow either
dorsally or ventrally, more refined pathways are chosen at
stages 25/26, when individual nerves begin to form
[42,43]. At that time, motor neurons can be separated into
different subpopulations based on the expression pattern
of transcription factors [44-46] or type-II cadherins [47].
At stage 25, all plexins and both neuropilins were
expressed in motor neurons (Figure 6). PlexinA1, A4, and,
at low levels, B2 were expressed in a pattern overlapping
with Isl1-positive motor neurons (Panel C in Figure 6)
that coincided with the expression of SC1 a surface marker
for motor neurons C1 (not shown). In contrast, the
expression of plexinD1 and npn-1 was strong in medial

Pairwise alignment of individual domains of chicken Plexin proteins indicate that the intracellular SP (sex-plexin) domain is highly conserved
between the different family members, whereas the two extracellular domains, SEMA and PSI (plexin/semaphorin/integrin), show far less
conservation. Interestingly the conservation between individual domains of chicken plexinB1 and B2 is only slightly higher than the homology
between class A and class B plexins, suggesting that chicken plexinBs are evolutionary quite distinct. Numbers indicate percentage of identical/
conserved amino acids.

motor neurons labeled by MNR2 but not by Isl1 (Panel D
in Figure 6). Npn-2 appeared to be expressed predominantly in a dorsolateral subset of Isl1-positive cells.
PlexinA2 and C1 were scattered throughout the ventral
horn without clear resemblance to either the Isl1 or the
MNR2 pattern and expression levels were rather low. This
was also true for plexinB1 that was expressed throughout
the neural tube with higher levels found in dorsal commissural neurons, the floor plate, and the ventricular
zone. In addition to plexinB1, the floor plate maintained
expression of plexinA2, and C1 at stage 25. PlexinA1 was
still detectable in lateral floor-plate cells, although at
lower levels. Dorsolateral commissural neurons still
expressed all plexinAs, plexinB1, and C1, but no neuropilin.
During intermediate stages of spinal cord development
plexin expression is reduced
The early phase of spinal cord development that we analyzed (stages 18 â 25) is characterized by the birth and differentiation of neuronal populations [48-50,37]. This
two-day period (E3-E5) revealed fundamental changes in
the expression patterns of plexins and neuropilins (compare Figures 2, 4, and 6). In contrast, the expression patterns changed much less during the next two to three days,

the intermediate phase of spinal cord development. At
stage 30 (Figure 7), the expression pattern of plexinAs
remained the same as at stage 25, except for the decrease
of plexinA1 in the dorsal half of the spinal cord. PlexinB1
persisted only in the ventral ventricular zone, and
plexinB2 disappeared altogether. PlexinC1 was now
expressed diffusely throughout the gray matter with
higher levels in the lateral motor column and the floor
plate. After its transient expression in motor neurons at
stages 25 (Figure 6) and 26 (not shown) plexinD1 was no
longer expressed in the spinal cord but was restricted to
endothelial cells of the blood vessels as described for the
mouse [30]. The expression of npn-1 and npn-2 at stage
30 (Figure 7) remained largely complementary in different populations of motor neurons as already indicated at
stage 25 (Figure 6). The expression patterns of the
neuropilins in motor neurons did not resemble those of
any of the plexins. A more detailed analysis of the individual subpopulations expressing plexins and neuropilins
would exceed the scope of this study and would require
double and triple staining for transcription factors of the
ETS and LIM homeodomain families [45,51,52] or comparison with the analysis of type-II cadherin expression
patterns in motor neuron pools [47]. The analysis of
whole-mount preparations of stage 26 spinal cords did

Late stages of spinal cord development
During late stages of spinal cord development, between
stages 35 (Figure 8) and 40 (Figure 9), motor axons have
reached their target muscles and sensory afferents terminate in their specific target layers of the gray matter.
Expression patterns of plexins and neuropilins still
changed. Overall their levels decreased and their spatial
extent became more restricted. Fundamental changes in
expression were observed for npn-1 that was found in the
dorsal spinal cord during late stages of spinal cord development, but not during early and intermediate stages,
where it had been restricted to the ventral spinal cord.

Another significant change was found for plexinB1 that
was detected in cells located in the funiculi all around the
spinal cord at stage 40 (Figure 9). The expression of
plexinB1 (Figure 9A for higher magnification) correlated
with areas of O4 expression, a marker for oligodendrocytes (Figure 9B) but not with GFAP expression, a marker
for astrocytes (Figure 9C).
At late stages of development, the expression of plexins
was restricted to the dorsal gray matter, or was turned off
altogether (plexinA4, B2). Strong expression only persisted for plexinA2 and C1 in the dorsal horn, in laminae
I â III (Figure 9; [53]).

PlexinA1, A2, and B1 were detectable with very similar patterns in the dorsal spinal cord at stage 18, the earliest stage
we investigated (arrowheads). PlexinA1 and A2 were also
expressed in early motor neurons of the ventral spinal cord
(open arrowheads). PlexinA2, B1 and C1 were the only plexins expressed in the floor plate (open arrow). In contrast to
plexinA1 and A2, npn-1 (NP1) was expressed only in motor
neurons that had migrated laterally (arrow). Npn-2 (NP2)
was expressed at low levels in the dorsal spinal cord similar
to plexinA1, A2, and B1 (arrowhead). Adjacent sections

not reveal any substantial changes in the expression patterns of plexins and neuropilins throughout the lumbosacral level [see Additional file 3].

DRGs exhibit a dynamic plexin expression pattern
Dorsal root ganglia expressed a variety of plexins during
different stages of development. During early stages
(stages 22â25), when sensory neurons extend processes
into the periphery but before collaterals of central processes are formed ([54], and references therein), plexinA1,
A4, and npn-2 transcripts were found at high levels; low
levels were detectable for plexinA2, B1, and npn-1 at stage
22 (Figure 4). At stage 25, expression patterns were
unchanged for plexins but levels had switched for
neuropilins, i.e. npn-1 was expressed at higher, npn-2 at
lower levels at stage 25 compared to stage 22 (Figure 6,
compare to Figure 4).

At stage 30, when sensory neurons start to extend collaterals into the gray matter of the spinal cord (see [54] and references therein), high levels of plexinA4 were maintained
in DRGs (Figure 7), whereas levels of plexinA1 and B1 had
decreased. PlexinC1 expression levels started to increase
(compare Figures 6, 7, and 8). PlexinA2 remained
restricted to a subset of cells. Interestingly, the expression
of npn-2 became restricted to sensory neurons located in
the dorsal-most part of the DRG at stage 30. As nociceptive, mechanoreceptive, and proprioceptive neurons are
segregated in the chicken DRG, these cells are most likely
nociceptive neurons [55,53].

PlexinA1 and A2 are already expressed in neural precursors
PlexinA1 and A2 are already expressed in neural precursors. At stage 18, the homeodomain protein Pax6 labels precursor cells in the intermediate zone of the developing spinal cord (A; [60]). Its ventral expression boundary that is defined by
the morphogen Shh released from the floor plate reaches the area with the progenitors of motor neurons expressing MNR2
(B and G). Low levels of MNR2 proteins are seen in progenitor cells located medially (arrowhead in B), where motor neurons
are born. MNR2 protein persists and accumulates in postmitotic motor neurons expressing Isl1 (C). In the dorsal spinal cord,
Pax7 expression marks a population of precursor cells that give rise to dorsal interneuron subpopulations (D; [37]). Note the
decline of Pax7 staining toward the periphery of the spinal cord. Even at stage 19, postmitotic neurons expressing neurofilament proteins are found only at the peripheral margin of the spinal cord (E). At this stage, the dorsolateral population of commissural axons, characterized by the expression of Axonin-1 (arrow in F), starts to extend axons toward the floor plate [38].
At the same, more ventrally located interneurons expressing Axonin-1 also extend axons but their pathway has not been characterized in detail (arrowheads). A comparison of the expression of Pax6 (green hatched area), MNR2 (light and dark blue,
characterizing low and high protein levels, respectively) and Isl1 (dark blue) is shown in G. For clarity the mRNA expression
domains of plexinA1 and A2 have been added in H (red). Significant overlap was found between the plexin expression domain
and early motor neurons characterized by MNR2 staining (H). In the dorsal spinal cord domains of Pax7 (green) and Axonin-1
protein expression (yellow) are compared to the domains expressing plexinA1 and A2 mRNA in I. Plexins do not extend to
the periphery of the neural tube where postmitotic neurons expressing neurofilament or axonin-1 are found. Bar in A through

tion that plexins are expressed in the floor plate is rather
unexpected, as the floor plate is the intermediate target of
commissural axons, and therefore, the site where ligands
for axonal guidance receptors should be expressed. A
receptor function of Plexins on floor-plate cells at stage 22
is not obvious, as floor-plate cells do not migrate or
undergo structural remodeling at this time. Floor-plate

Both neuropilins andstage 22 except D1, were expressed
Both neuropilins and all plexins, except D1, were
expressed in the spinal cord at stage 22. Motor neurons expressed plexinA1, A2, A4, B2, and both neuropilins
(open arrowheads). Levels of plexinB2 were very low and
plexinA2 appeared to be expressed only in a subset of motor
neurons. All class-A plexin were found in dorsal commissural
neurons (arrowheads). PlexinA1 and A2, but not A4, were
detected in the floor plate (open arrows). Furthermore, the
floor plate expressed plexinB1 and C1. PlexinB1 was found
throughout the spinal cord with higher levels in the ventricular zone. PlexinD1 was not expressed in the spinal cord at all,
but was restricted to endothelial cells and cells ensheathing
the spinal cord. The DRGs expressed plexinA1, A2, A4, B1,
npn-1 and npn-2 (asterisks). For a comparison sections
hybridized with the respective sense probes are shown in
[Additional file 2]. Bar 200 Âµm.
At stage 35, plexinA1 and A2 were only found in a few
cells located in the periphery of the DRG, where proprioceptive neurons are located (Figure 8; [47,53,55]).

As mentioned above, the chicken genome contains only
three members of the A class: plexinA1, A2, and A4. The
available expression patterns of class-A plexins
[15,56,58,62] fail to reflect the dynamics of plexinAexpression changes shown in this study. At E12.5,
plexinA1 is reported to be barely detectable in the mouse
spinal cord and DRGs [56,58]. PlexinA2 was found in the
roof plate and in interneurons of the ventral spinal cord
but not in motor neurons of the trunk region [58]. At
more rostral levels, plexinA2 was found in the dorsal spinal cord and in DRGs. Reports of plexinA3 expression
were contradictory. Brown et al. [58] reported plexinA3
expression in the ventricular zone and in the floor plate,
whereas Cheng et al. [56] reported plexinA3 to be
expressed throughout the spinal cord (except for the ventricular zone). The reason for this discrepancy is unclear.
Compared to the expression pattern in chick, the pattern
of plexinA3 reported by Brown et al. [58] is almost identical to the one we found for plexinB1 at stage 25 (Figure 6).
The pattern of plexinA4 in the E12.5 spinal cord of the
mouse was restricted to a single population of cells in the
lateral spinal cord and to the DRGs [56,62]. With respect
to the development of sensory afferents to the spinal cord,
E12.5 in the mouse is comparable to stage 30 in the chick.
The development of motor neurons at E12.5 is closer to
stage 25. We therefore used both stage 25 and stage 30 spinal cords to compare the plexinA patterns between mouse
and chick. While plexinA2 and A4 patterns did not change
considerably between stages 25 and 30, plexinA1 levels
decreased strongly in the dorsal spinal cord and in the
DRGs. Consistent with the pattern reported by Brown et
al. [58] in mouse, plexinA2 was expressed in the roof plate
at stage 25. However, in contrast to the chick, mouse
plexinA2 was not expressed in the floor plate.

Discussion
PlexinAs have a more widespread distribution compared to
neuropilins
The distribution of class-A plexins has been studied in
more detail than other plexin subfamilies [15,56,57].
Their function has been analyzed predominantly in context of their role as co-receptors (together with Neuropilins) for secreted class-3 Semaphorins [9,56,58,59] but see
[18,19,27]. However, based on their much more dynamic
and more widespread expression, a Neuropilin-independent role of PlexinAs is evident. In particular, the observa-

PlexinBs are only transiently expressed in neurons
The expression of class-B plexins is difficult to link to any
specific function. They are expressed in neurons, although
only transiently, and in glial cells. The most prominent
and longest lasting expression for a class-B plexin is seen
in the ventricular zone, where plexinB1 is expressed from
stage 22 to stage 35. This pattern is consistent with the
mouse, where plexinB1 was found in the ventricular zone
of the spinal cord at E13.5 [63]. At stage 40 in the chick,
plexinB1 is restricted to cells in the white matter, presum-

formation of central sensory connections seems rather
unlikely in the chick in contrast to mouse, where plexinB1
was found in DRGs from E13.5 to E15.5 [63].

Figure 5
The expression of plexinA1 in the floor plate is not uniform
The expression of plexinA1 in the floor plate is not
uniform. At stage 22, plexinA1 (A) is expressed strongly in
lateral floor-plate cells but present only at very much
reduced levels or absent altogether in medial floor-plate cells
(arrowhead). In contrast to plexinA1, plexinA2 (B) and C1
(C) are found throughout the floor plate at high levels. The
floor plate is identified by the expression of the transcription
factor HNF3Î² (D, red in F; [41]). The area exhibiting reduced
levels of plexinA1, A2, and C1 adjacent to the floor plate
represents area p3, characterized by the expression of the
transcription factor Nkx2.2 (E, green in F; [41,50]). Bar 100

ably oligodendrocytes. This is in contrast to the expression
of plexinB1 in mouse [63]. In mouse, plexinB3 is
expressed in cells of the white matter resembling the
expression of plexinB1 in chick. Furthermore, the expression of plexinB2, which has been reported to match the
expression of plexinB1 in the ventricular zone of E13.5
mice [63], differs in chick, where levels of plexinB2 are
generally low in the spinal cord and peripheral ganglia. A
very weak transient expression of plexinB1 and B2 is
detectable throughout the gray matter and in motor neurons between stages 22 and 25, respectively. During that
time expression is also found in the DRGs and along the
ventral roots, which would indicate that these cells are
early Schwann cells aligning with motor axons. In contrast
to observations in the mouse [63] plexinBs are not
expressed during the time when sensory afferents target
their specific layers in gray matter, as no expression is
detectable between stages 30 to 35. In the chick, collaterals of primary sensory axons do not form before stage 29
[54]. Thus, a contribution of both plexinB1 and B2 to the

PlexinC1 is not expressed in early stages of neural
development
In contrast to plexinAs, which are expressed during the
time when neurons extend their axons, plexinC1 is
expressed only during late stages of neural development.
Neither commissural neurons nor motor neurons express
plexinC1 during the time when they approach their first
intermediate target, the floor plate and the plexus region,
respectively. Interestingly, strong expression of plexinC1
is seen in the floor plate at stage 22 (Figures 4 and 5C), i.e.
when the majority of the axons from dorsolateral commissural neurons are in the floor plate [38]. The expression in the floor plate persists through stage 25, when
commissural axons have crossed the midline and turned
into the longitudinal axis [41]. A massive increase in
plexinC1 expression in DRGs is found at stage 35, a time
when all other plexins are downregulated compared to
their earlier expression levels in DRGs. PlexinC1 expression in DRGs persists at stage 40. Thus, plexinC1 starts to
be expressed in all neuronal subpopulations that we analyzed when axons have completed the navigation to their
targets suggesting that plexinC1 might be involved in target recognition rather than pathfinding. This would be
consistent with the finding of Pasterkamp et al. [29] who
reported that the effect of Semaphorin7A, which binds to
PlexinC1 with high affinity [7], on axon growth was independent of PlexinC1 but rather mediated by
Semaphorin7A's interaction with Integrins.
PlexinD1 is expressed predominantly in endothelial cells
PlexinD1 is expressed transiently in motor neurons in a
subpopulation-specific manner between stages 24 and 26.
It is not expressed in the spinal cord during initial axon
growth of motor neurons. Only after motor axons have
reached the plexus region, some medially located cell
populations express plexinD1 at stage 25. As described in
mouse [30,31], plexinD1 is predominantly expressed in
endothelial cells of the developing intersomitic blood vessels during early stages of development and in blood vessels in general during later stages.
The expression of neuropilin-2 in chick is much more
restricted than in mouse
The expression of npn-2, but not npn-1, in the developing
chicken spinal cord differs considerably from the expression pattern reported in mouse. Neuropilin-1 is expressed
in DRGs and motor neurons in E10.5 and E12.5 mouse
spinal cord [1,58] in a pattern that is similar to the expression in chick at stages 22â25 (Figures 4 and 6). The expression seen in mouse spinal cord at E13.5 [1] is virtually the
same as seen in chick at stage 35 (Figure 8).

ing in the mouse [66]. In chick, npn-2 is not expressed in
the dorsal spinal cord at comparable stages. It is restricted
to some pools of motor neurons and becomes further
restricted with increasing embryonic age. Moreover, npn2 is never expressed in the embryonic chicken floor plate.

Conclusion
Our analysis of plexin and neuropilin expression during
development of the spinal cord reflects their dynamic regulation that coincides with time windows of axon growth
and guidance of different neuronal populations. PlexinAs
are expressed more widely than any other class of plexins
both temporally and spatially. Notably they are also
expressed more widely than the neuropilins, indicating
that they must have functions that are Neuropilin-independent. This aspect is underestimated when global
expression patterns are compared rather than the detailed
subpopulation-specific expression patterns. PlexinBs are
expressed during early and intermediate stages of spinal
cord development but always at low levels and rather
ubiquitously. PlexinC1 is expressed predominantly during late stages of development, whereas plexinD1 is
expressed only very transiently in the spinal cord.

Stage expressed in thestage when all plexins and neuropilins
Stage 25 was the only stage when all plexins and
neuropilins were expressed in the spinal cord. The
most prominent mRNA levels were found for plexinAs. They
were all detectable in dorsolateral commissural interneurons
(arrowheads) and in motor neurons (open arrowheads).
Expression of plexinA2 was restricted to some scattered
cells in the ventral horn, but absent from lateral areas. Only
subpopulations of motor neurons expressed plexinD1, npn1, and npn-2. PlexinB1, B2, and C1 were found in all motor
neurons although at low levels (open arrowheads). Panels A
and B are higher magnifications of the sections hybridized
with plexinA1 and npn-1, respectively, in comparison to Isl1
(C) and MNR2 (D) staining in adjacent sections. The expression domains of plexinA1, A4, and npn-2 are more similar to
the domains expressing Isl1, whereas those for plexinA2, D1,
and npn-1 overlap with the more medial motor neurons
expressing MNR2. Floor-plate expression was still found for
plexinA1 (lateral floor-plate cells only), A2, B1, and C1 (open
arrows). The presence of plexinA1, A2, A4, B1, npn-1, and
npn-2 in DRGs is indicated by asterisks. Bar 200 Âµm.
In contrast to the widespread expression of npn-2 in the
mouse spinal cord between E10.5 and 12.5 [1,58,64,65],
the expression in the embryonic chicken spinal cord is
much more restricted at comparable stages. In mouse,
npn-2 is expressed very strongly in dorsal commissural
neurons, in ventral populations of interneurons, in motor
neurons, and in the floor plate. Functional studies have
identified a role for npn-2 in commissural axon pathfind-

Assembly of chicken plexin cDNAs
cDNA sequences for chicken plexins were assembled
using the combined information from the ChickEST [67]
and the chicken genomic database [68]. Seven different
genomic regions coding for plexins were identified using
the tblastx alignment algorithm on available vertebrate
plexins. The corresponding genomic fragments were
downloaded and analyzed using the Genscan gene prediction program [69]. Putative cDNA and protein sequences
were compared to the corresponding mammalian homologues and Genscan prediction errors were corrected by
manual inspection of the intron/exon boundaries. Gaps
in the assembled sequences, due to inaccurate or incomplete genome sequencing, were filled by corresponding
EST sequences where possible. A total of 85 chicken ESTs
covering parts of 7 different plexins were identified.
Among these, 65 contained parts of the coding sequence,
whereas the rest covered only parts of the UTR. Sequence
alignment of genomic and EST sequences was done using
the SeqMan software (Lasergene, DNASTAR). Based on
overlapping EST sequences that were supplemented with
genomic sequences, 3'UTR sequences were added to the
coding sequence. UTR sequences were terminated at the
first polyadenylation AATAAA/ATTAAA sequence that followed after verified chicken UTR EST sequences. Using
this combined approach a total of 5 complete and 2 partial cDNA sequences for plexins could be assembled.

expressed in the spinal cord, the expression levels of
plexinB1 had declined considerably compared to stage 25.
PlexinA1 was strongly reduced in the dorsal spinal cord, but

plexinA1, A2, A4, C1, npn-1, and npn-2 were expressed

Phylogenetic tree assembly and analysis of domain identity
The domain structure of representative members of the
chicken and mouse plexin superfamily was obtained
using the SMART program [70]. Individual domains were
extracted from the sequence using predicted domain
boundaries. Conserved domains from the different plexin
subfamilies were aligned using the CLUSTAL W alignment
algorithm [71,72] provided by the MegAlign software
(Lasergene, DNASTAR). Obvious mistakes in domain
boundary prediction were manually adjusted. For better
representation alignment files were exported into the
TREEVIEW software, enabling the graphical representation of the unrooted tree [73]. Identical and conserved
amino acids within individual domains were determined
by pairwise alignment using the bl2seq program [74].

mixed with 3 Âµl DIG RNA labeling mix (Roche; 10 mM
NTP). Three Âµl T3 or T7 RNA polymerase (Promega, 20 U/

(Promega, 40 U/Âµl), 3 Âµl 100 mM DTT and DEPC-treated
H2O were added to a final volume of 30 Âµl. After incubation at 37Â°C for 2 hours, 3 Âµl RNase-free DNaseI
(Promega, 1 U/Âµl) were added to the mix, and incubated
at 37Â°C for 30 minutes. Nuclease treatment was stopped
by the addition of 2 Âµl 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0). The cRNA
probes were LiCl-precipitated and dissolved in 50 Âµl of
DEPC-treated H2O.
In situ hybridization
Chicken embryos were collected at indicated embryonic
stages, fixed for 2 hours in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)
and cryoprotected with 25 % sucrose in 0.1 M sodium
phosphate buffer overnight. The embryos were embedded
in Tissue-Tek O.C.T compound (Sakura), cut transversally
into 20â25 Âµm sections at a temperature of -20Â°C, and
mounted on Superfrost Plus microscope slides (MenzelGlaeser). After drying the slides for 30 minutes at 37Â°C,
they were stored at -20Â°C until further use. For all steps
until hybridization we used diethyl pyrocarbonate
(DEPC) treated H2O and stock solutions. Sections were
washed in PBS for 5 minutes and postfixed in 4% PFA for
30 minutes. They were washed twice in PBS and once in
H2O for 5 minutes each. Sections were then acetylated for
10 minutes in 1% triethanolamine containing 0.25%

room temperature. Sections were then blocked for 1 hour
in blocking buffer (3% milkpowder in detection buffer)
and incubated for 1 hour in anti-DIG-AP antibodies
(Roche) diluted 1:5000 in blocking buffer (300 Âµl/slide)
in a humidified chamber. After two 15-minutes washes in
detection buffer, sections were washed for 5 minutes in
alkaline phosphatase (AP) buffer (0.1 M Tris-base, 0.1 M
NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2, pH 9.5). For the color reaction, sections were incubated 12â24 hours in a dark humidified
chamber in AP buffer (500 Âµl/slide) containing 337.5 Âµg/
ml nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT; Roche), 175 Âµg/ml 5bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate (BCIP; Roche), and
240 Âµg/ml levamisole (Sigma). The reaction was stopped
by washing sections 2 times for 10 minutes each in TE
buffer (10 mM Tris-base, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), followed
by a short dip in H2O. Finally, the sections were coverslipped with an aqueous mounting medium (Celvol).
Reaction times were the same for all stages for a given
probe, except for plexinA1 and A2. For these two probes
reaction times for stage 18 were longer than those for
older stages to optimize signal to noise rations. Thus,
expression levels at st18 cannot be directly compared to
older stages.
Immunohistochemistry
Antibodies recognizing Pax6, Pax7, MNR2, Isl1, and SC1/
Ben were obtained from the Developmental Studies
Hybridoma Bank. The monoclonal antibody RMO270,
recognizing neurofilament protein was purchased from
Zymed, rabbit anti-axonin-1 was described earlier [75].
Secondary antibodies goat anti-mouse Cy3 (Jackson Laboratories) and goat anti-rabbit Alexa488 (Molecular
Probes) were used to visualize primary antibody binding
sites. Sections were prepared as detailed above. The staining protocol was as detailed earlier [54].
