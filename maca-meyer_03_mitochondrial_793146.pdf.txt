Abstract
Background: World-wide phylogeographic distribution of human complete mitochondrial DNA
sequences suggested a West Asian origin for the autochthonous North African lineage U6. We
report here a more detailed analysis of this lineage, unraveling successive expansions that affected
not only Africa but neighboring regions such as the Near East, the Iberian Peninsula and the Canary
Islands.
Results: Divergence times, geographic origin and expansions of the U6 mitochondrial DNA clade,
have been deduced from the analysis of 14 complete U6 sequences, and 56 different haplotypes,
characterized by hypervariable segment sequences and RFLPs.
Conclusions: The most probable origin of the proto-U6 lineage was the Near East. Around
30,000 years ago it spread to North Africa where it represents a signature of regional continuity.
Subgroup U6a reflects the first African expansion from the Maghrib returning to the east in
Paleolithic times. Derivative clade U6a1 signals a posterior movement from East Africa back to the
Maghrib and the Near East. This migration coincides with the probable Afroasiatic linguistic
expansion. U6b and U6c clades, restricted to West Africa, had more localized expansions. U6b
probably reached the Iberian Peninsula during the Capsian diffusion in North Africa. Two
autochthonous derivatives of these clades (U6b1 and U6c1) indicate the arrival of North African
settlers to the Canarian Archipelago in prehistoric times, most probably due to the Saharan
desiccation. The absence of these Canarian lineages nowadays in Africa suggests important
demographic movements in the western area of this Continent.

Background
Attested presence of Caucasian people in Northern Africa
goes up to Paleolithic times. From the archaeological
record it has been proposed that, as early as 45,000 years
ago (ya), anatomically modern humans, most probably
expanded the Aterian stone industry from the Maghrib

into most of the Sahara [1]. More evolved skeletal remains
indicate that 20,000 years later the Iberomaurusian makers, replaced the Aterian culture in the coastal Maghrib.
Several hypothesis have been forwarded concerning the
Iberomaurusian origin. They can be resumed in those
which propose an arrival, from the East, either from the

Near East or Eastern Africa, and those which point to west
Mediterranean Europe, either from the Iberian Peninsula,
across the Gibraltar Strait, or from Italy, via Sicily, as their
most probable homeland [2]. Between 10,000 and 6,000
ya the Neolithic Capsian industry flourished farther
inland. The historic penetration in the area of classical
Mediterranean cultures, ending with the Islamic domination, supposed a strong cultural influx. However, it seems
that the demic impact was not strong enough to modify
the prehistoric genetic pool.
Linguistic research suggests that the Afroasiatic phylum of
languages could have originated and extended with these
Caucasians, either from the Near East or Eastern Africa
and that posterior developments of the Capsian Neolithic
in the Maghrib might be related to the origin and dispersal
of proto-Berber speaking people into the area [3]. Nowadays, the Berber speakers, scattered throughout Northwest
Africa from the Atlantic to the Lybic desert and from the
Mediterranean shores to the south of the Sahel, are considered the genuine descendants of those prehistoric colonizers. Some important issues are pending of resolution
to clarify the past and present of the North African Caucasians: To which extent the Neolithic waves substituted the
Paleolithic recipients? Which is the most probable origin
of these prehistoric occupants? Did they come from
Europe, East Africa, Southwest Asia or are they a result of
an "in situ" evolution? Is there a correspondence between
the Afroasiatic diversification and the spread of
Caucasians?
Recently, molecular genetic research on North African
populations has contributed new data to test the major
issues proposed on archaeological, anthropological and
linguistic grounds. The studies based on uniparental
genetic markers have been particularly informative. Both,
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences [4,5], and Ychromosome binary markers [6,7] detected specific North
African haplotypes that confirm an ancient human colonization for this area and a sharp discontinuity between
Northwest Africa and the Iberian Peninsula. From a
mtDNA point of view, the most informative of these
genetic markers is the North African clade U6. On the
basis of complete mtDNA sequences, it has been proposed that U6 lineages, mainly found in North Africa, are
the signatures of a return to Africa around 39,000–52,000
ya [8]. This stresses the importance of its detailed study in
order to trace one of the earliest Caucasian arrivals to
Africa. Although in moderate frequencies, the geographic
range of this clade extends from the Near East to the
Canary Islands, along the Atlantic shores of Northwest
Africa and from the Sahel belt, including Ethiopia, to the
southern Mediterranean rim. Out of this area, U6 has only
been spotted in the Iberian Peninsula [9–12], Sicily [13],
in the north European Ashkenazic Jews [14], and in Ibero-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/4/15

America. The presence in the latter is, most probably, the
result of the Spanish and Portuguese colonization
[15,16].
In order to construct an unambiguous phylogeny for this
clade and infer precise ages for the whole group and for its
derivatives, we have fully sequenced eleven mitochondrial
lineages representing the main branches of U6. Subsequently, we analyzed the geographic distribution range
and relative diversity of these subclades, to deduce their
most probable expansion origins based on sequence
information of the first hypervariable segment (HVSI) of
the mitochondrial control region and on new RFLPs, discovered to be diagnostic for them.

Results
A new sublineage for U6
Haplogroup U splits from R by mutations 11467, 12308
and 12372. Three branches sprout from this root: U5
(3197, 9477, 13617 and 16270), U6 (3348 and 16172)
and the rest of the U clade defined by mutation 1811
[8,17,18]. For this reason, a representative of U5 was chosen as an outgroup.

The phylogenetic tree based on complete mtDNA U6
sequences, confirms that this clade is defined by mutations 3348 and 16172 (Fig. 1). The former can be detected
by RFLP analysis using MboI [15]. The existence of three
subgroups is also evident. U6a was defined by the presence of HVSI mutations 16172, 16219 and 16278 [4] and
now by 7805 and 14179 in the coding region, that can be
tested by RFLPs -7802 MaeI and +14179 AccI, respectively.
Subgroup U6b was characterized by HVSI mutations
16172, 16219 and 16311 [4], to which mutation 9438
(detectable by RFLP -9438 HaeIII) can now be added. The
new clade U6c is defined by HVSI mutations 16169,
16172 and 16189 and at least by mutations 4965 and
5081, that can be tested by RFLPs +4963 Aci I and -5079
Tsp509 I, respectively. In addition, a subgroup, U6a1, has
been detected within U6a characterized by the addition of
HVSI mutation 16189 [4]. In the same way, HVSI mutation 16163 classifies subgroup U6b1, autochthonous of
the Canary Islands [19]. Within the coding region, this
subgroup can be further defined by RFLP + 2349 MboI.
From Fig. 1, an important question rises about the constant mutation rate in the coding region. The mean
number of substitutions accumulated in U6b lineages
(Table 1) is significantly smaller than those in U6a (P =
0.013) and is near significance in U6c (P = 0.058). These
differences are mainly due to the number of mutations
accumulated in the coding region. Following others [20],
we used the likelihood-ratio test [21] to asses whether the
mutations accumulated on the different branches were
compatible or not with a uniform rate. The difference

between the values obtained for the uniform clock model
(L0 = -23060.25) and for the variable rate model (L1 = 23032.22), was statistically significant at the 5% level. So,
the simpler clock-like tree was rejected. On the other
hand, the substitution ratio between coding vs. HVSI
region is double in U6a than in U6b or U6c (Table 1). Furthermore, taking into account the ratio of synonymous vs.
non-synonymous substitutions in the coding region,
again the U6a value doubles that of U6b or U6c, reaching

a significant level (P = 0.0237, in a two-tailed Fisher exact
test). Both selection and stochastic processes have to be
invoked to satisfactorily explain these data. A bias in lineage sampling is the most probable cause of the different
substitution ratios between D-loop and coding regions:
the U6b and U6c lineages were chosen for their different
geographic origin and, comparatively, large divergence in
HVSI, whilst for U6a we chose central representatives of
the different subclusters excepting that of the Canary

Islands. In relation to the differences in synonymous vs.
non-synonymous ratios, they could be attributed to the
action of purifying selection, having a stronger effect on
the older U6a lineages. From this, we deduced that both
U6b and U6c spread more recently. Finally, the apparent
differences in substitution rates between U6b and U6a or
U6c could better be the result of genetic drift, so that the
founder lineage that originated the U6b subgroup was less
evolved than those that originated U6a and U6c. However, we have to point out that in a similar case, in which
significant differences were found in the number of mutations accumulated on two clades of haplogroup L2, selection was suggested as the most probable cause [20].
Geographic distribution of U6 lineages
Fig. 2 shows the reduced median network obtained from
the 56 U6 haplotypes found for the HVSI region between
positions 16086–16370. The basal motif for haplogroup
U6 has varied as new data have been added. Algerian
sequences [9] suggested that the ancestral sequence harbored mutations 16172 16189. Additional data [4] considered 16172 16219 as the most probable ancestral
motif. However, the complete sequence of the individual
with this motif relocates it in U6a, presenting a back
mutation in HVSI position 16278. Our data points to
16172 as the only substitution present in the basal motif.
Unfortunately, the high recurrence of this mutation
makes it insufficient to diagnose this haplogroup. The
highest frequencies for haplogroup U6 as a whole are
found in Northwest Africa (Table 2), with a maximum of
29% in the Algerian Berbers [9]. Subgroup U6a and its
derivative U6a1 present the widest geographic distribution, from the Canary Islands in the West, to Syria and
Ethiopia in the East, and from the Iberian Peninsula in the
North, to Kenya in the South. In contrast, U6b shows a
more limited and patched distribution, restricted to western populations. In the Iberian Peninsula, U6b is more
frequent in the North whilst U6a is prevalent in the South.
In Africa, it has been sporadically found in Morocco and
Algeria in the North, and Senegal and Nigeria in the
South, pointing to a wider distribution in the past, or to
gene flow from a geographic focus which has still not
been sampled. Curiously, two Arab Bedouins [22] with
the same haplotype (16111 16172 16219 16311 16362),
are the only Eastern representatives classified as U6b. It
would be very interesting to test the 9438 HaeIII restriction enzyme to confirm this classification. Furthermore,
subgroup U6b1 characterized by mutation 16163, is
restricted to the Canarian Archipelago and the Iberian
Peninsula. The geographic distribution of the new subgroup U6c, characterized by the basic motif 16169 16172
16189, is even more localized. It has only been found in
the Canary Islands and Morocco. It could also be present
in Algeria, if the two individuals with haplotype 16172
16189 16234 16311 [9], classified as U* by RFLP analysis

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/4/15

[5], belong to this subgroup. Like for U6b, an autochthonous U6c subcluster (characterized by mutation
16129) was also detected in the Canarian Archipelago.
Relationships between areas
Linearized FST values distinguished three significantly differentiated geographical areas: Continental Africa, the Iberian Peninsula and the Canary Islands (Table 3).
Nucleotide diversities within areas (Table 3) ranged from
3.253 in the Iberian Peninsula to 2.059 in East Africa. At
first sight, it is striking that diversities are larger in the
Canary Islands and Iberia than in Africa. We think that
demographic processes are responsible of this situation.
In Africa, the geographic and social isolation of the different Berber groups [23], could have promoted a loss of
diversity by genetic drift. On the contrary, the presence in
the Canary Islands and Iberia of representatives of all, or
nearly all, U6 subclades, some of them not detected nowadays in the Continent, strongly point to the existence of
several migratory waves from Africa, possibly at different
times, which have increased their variability. This explanation is reinforced when the number of segregating sites
(S) are taken into account. This value is larger in West
Africa (5.10 ± 1.5) than in the Canaries (2.60 ± 1.0) and
the Iberian Peninsula (3.90 ± 1.4), but East Africa presents
a lower value (3.2 ± 1.4). The fact that U6b and U6c have
a restricted western distribution undoubtedly contributes
to this Continental difference. However, the younger
U6a1 branch contradicts this general trend. For this subclade, East and West Africa are statistically differentiated (P
= 0.016), and the former presents a higher nucleotide
diversity (1.55 ± 1.11) than the latter (0.98 ± 0.75). Geographic distributions and diversity values of U6 are congruent with a western origin and radiation for all
subclades excepting U6a1 that, most probably, had an
eastern origin.
Radiation ages
Radiation ages for U6 and its subclades have been estimated on the basis of complete coding and HVSI
sequences (Table 4). In general, ages obtained from HVSI
are larger than those deduced from the coding region.
Both approaches present inconveniences for the time estimates. It has been demonstrated that the coding region
has evolved at a roughly constant rate [24]. However, as
relatively few clades are fully sequenced, stochastic and/or
intentional sampling may bias the representation of the
chosen lineages. On the other hand, HVSI estimations are
based on a large number of individuals minimizing sampling errors. However, we deal with a short sequence that
has not evolved at a constant rate across all human lineages [24]. Furthermore, from the phylogeny of complete
U6 sequences (Fig. 1), it has been deduced, once more,
that empirical time estimations are not independent of
the demographic history of the population sampled.

Therefore, we have taken coalescence ages only as rough
time frames into which lineage expansions could have
occurred. Adopting a conservative position we have used
ages based on the coding region whenever possible.

Discussion
African U6 origin and expansions
Discarding the Canary Islands, because the most ancient
human settlement seems to be no earlier than 2,500 ya
[25], and the Iberian Peninsula, because there are no consistent traces of U6 lineages in Europe, Northwest Africa is

left as the most probable place from where the African U6
subclades radiated. Another point is to decide whether the
proto-U6 ancestor was also of African origin. Although it
cannot be completely excluded, this hypothesis seems
highly improbable even invoking strong bottlenecks in
African populations. It is clear that the whole haplogroup
U is an offshoot of macrohaplogroup N. This lineage,
together with macrohaplogroup M, were the only ones
that, belonging to the star radiation of L3 in Africa, left
this continent to colonize Eurasia. Five mutations
separate N from the root of the African L3 [8], and there
are only late evolved N lineages in Africa, whereas representatives of the full N radiation are present in Eurasia.
Thus, this continent would be the logical homeland of the
proto-U6 that came back to Africa and spread in its northwest area around 30,000 ya (Table 4). Its most probable
route had to be through East Africa. So, the loss of
variability in this area is puzzling, although posterior
demic expansions affecting East Africa might be the cause.
This date roughly corresponds to the Paleolithic occupation of the Maghrib by the Iberomaurusian culture and to
the age of the evolved Homo sapiens sapiens skeletons
found in this area. Only one of the three U6 subclades,
U6a, experienced a great geographic radiation spreading
west to the Atlantic shores and east, crossing Africa, to the
Near East. A posterior offshoot of this clade, U6a1, has a
similar distribution. The upper bound for these expansions are around 28,000 and 17,000 ya, respectively
(Table 4). Genetic diversities are congruent with a west to
east expansion for U6a and a more probable east to west

expansion for U6a1. Furthermore, the absence of U6b and
U6c lineages in the East suggests that the population from
which the U6a colonizers originated also lacked these lineages or presented them in very low frequencies. The fact
that 5 of the 8 U6a haplotypes detected in the Near East
are unique of this area (Fig. 2), points to prehistoric demic
movements as the most probable cause of the U6a Africa
to Asia migration, although historic events cannot be
completely ruled out. In frame with the estimated age of
U6a are archaeological data supporting early migrations
from Africa into the Near East [26]. The expansion of Caucasians in Africa has been correlated with the spread and
diversification of Afroasiatic languages. There are different
hypothesis to explain the Afroasiatic origin. For some, it
would be the result of a Neolithic demic diffusion from
the Near East to Africa [27,28]. For others, the Afroasiatic
originated in Africa and had a posterior demic spread to
West Asia [29,30]. A third possibility is that Afroasiatic
languages spread mostly through cultural contacts either
from Africa or from Asia [31]. Only demic diffusions
could be correlated with U6 expansions detected here.
Since an upper bound of 15,000 ya has been estimated for
the proto-Afroasiatic origin, it seems that the coalescence
age for U6a predates by far the origin of the Afroasiatic
phylum. However, the recent spread of U6a1 is more in
frame with the emergence of a proto-Afroasiatic language.
This U6a1 expansion would favor an East African origin
for the Afroasiatic and a posterior expansion to West
Africa and West Asia. However, a Near Eastern origin,

BMC Genetics 2003, 4

most probably predating the Neolithic expansion, cannot
be ruled out.
Iberian U6 origin and expansions
In Europe, U6 lineages have been consistently sampled
only in the Iberian Peninsula. It has been mentioned that
U6 nucleotide diversity is higher in Iberia than in Africa
[12]. This has been confirmed here (Table 3). However, S
is greater in West Africa. Considering the isolation of the
different Berber groups we think that, in this case, the latter is a better diversity measure. The absence of U6 representatives in the rest of Europe, is also an argument
against the hypothesis that these lineages could have
migrated to North Africa from Europe. Naturally, this
does not exclude that other mitochondrial lineages could
have followed this route. Most probably, the presence of
these African lineages in Iberia is the result of northward
expansions from Africa. The time of this expansion has
been predominantly attributed to either the Arab/Berber
occupation that lasted seven centuries [10] or to prehistoric immigrations of North Africans to Iberia [12]. Both
processes could have contributed to model the U6 landscape in Iberia. First, haplotype matches show that 10 of
the 19 U6 lineages detected in Iberia are not present in
Africa (Fig. 2), which points against only one recent immigration. Second, the geographic distribution of the U6 lineages in Iberia is puzzling. Whereas the U6b lineages,
nowadays very scarce in Africa, are mainly detected in the
Northwest, the U6 lineages found in highest frequencies
in Africa are predominant in the south, where the Islamic
rule lasted longer. At the light of these results we propose
that U6b in Iberia is the signal of a prehistoric North African immigration that could have also brought some U6a
lineages. Its actual northern range could be the result of a
forced retreat due to the arrival of new southern incomers
to Iberia. However, the U6a distribution is better
explained as the result of more recent gene flow from
North Africa. The age of U6b (approx. 10,000 ya) might
be considered as an upper bound for the prehistoric wave.
Curiously, around this time the Iberomaurusians began to
be displaced by the incoming Capsian culture in the
Maghrib. On archaeological grounds, it has been proposed that Iberomaurusians slowly retreated towards the
Atlantic coast from where they sailed to the Canary
Islands and southwards to the Malinese Sahara [2]. Coincidentally, these are the same places where the U6b lineages have been spotted (Fig. 2).
Canary Islands U6 origin and expansions
At a genetic level, the Berber origin of the Guanches, the
aboriginal population of the Canary Islands, and their
survival after the Spanish occupation, has been inferred
from the high frequency of U6 lineages in its modern population (Table 2), similar to that of North Africa [19,32].
This fact has been recently confirmed in a mtDNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/4/15

sequence study on aboriginal remains [33]. It was found
that in the Guanche maternal gene pool, U6b1 and U6a
were present at frequencies of 8.22% and 1.37%,
respectively. U6c was probably also present in the aboriginal pool as a haplotype (16129 16169 16172 16189),
now known to belong to subhaplogroup U6c, was proposed as a probable Canarian founder type [19]. As in
Northwest Iberia, U6b was the dominant U6 subclade carried by the North African settlers of the islands. All three
subclades are present in the modern Canarian population
at frequencies of 1.3%, 13.0% and 3.3% for U6a, U6b and
U6c, respectively, which is indicative of a broad aboriginal
component in the present maternal pool. Perhaps, the
comparatively higher frequency of U6a lineages might be
attributed to an additional Berber input as result of the
slave trade after the Spanish conquest [34,35]. What
remains enigmatic of the indubitable North African prehistoric colonization of the Archipelago is that it was carried out by people whose U6 lineages mainly belonged to
the U6b subclade that has only been spotted in very low
frequencies in the modern African populations of
Morocco, Algeria, Senegal and Nigeria (Table 2). Moreover, the U6b and U6c insular haplotypes belong to the
autochthonous U6b1 and U6c1 branches differing by
substitutions 16163 and 16129, respectively, from all
their African counterparts. As the most probable arrival of
the first prehistoric Canarian settlers was around 2,500 ya,
it is highly improbable that these mutations occurred on
the islands. Therefore, we expected to find these Canarian
lineages in some place of Africa. However, after extensive
sampling they have still not been detected. It is possible
that they are present somewhere in low frequencies but, in
any case, this phylogeographic distribution suggests that
Northwest Africa suffered important demic displacements
in the past.
Besides U6, other genetic markers such as 110(-) haplotype of the CD4/Alu system [36], and the M81 Y-chromosome binary marker [6,7], point to an ancient and
autochthonous human presence in Northwest Africa. An
eastward decline in M81 frequencies has been detected,
regrettably the lack of extensive intra-M81 microsatellite
diversity studies in Africa precludes phylogeographic
comparisons as those done with mtDNA. There are other
coincidences between mtDNA data and other systems. For
instance, using classical genetic markers, it was found that
the Iberian Peninsula showed smaller genetic distances
with East Africa than with West Africa [37]. The same pattern was observed for Y-chromosome studies [7], both in
line with our results (Table 3). More studies with other
genetic markers are necessary to corroborate, complement
or even contradict the proposed U6 landscape.
In summary, the phylogeography, nucleotide diversity,
and coalescence ages of U6 lineages show that this clade

Page 8 of 11

BMC Genetics 2003, 4

came back to Africa in Paleolithic times. Its most probable
origin was the Near East and not Europe, and since then,
its presence in North Africa has been permanent. The
focus of the first African expansion, detected by the spread
of U6a, was Northwest Africa reaching the Near East also
in the Paleolithic. The posterior U6a1 radiation most
probably occurred in Northeast Africa again extending to
the Near East. This movement is correlated in time with
the attributed origin and expansion of Afroasiatic languages. This U6a1 wave also arrived to the Maghrib, the
Northwest African margin, where the more localized U6b
and U6c lineages were spreading. This movement is in
time frame with the Capsian culture. Based on archaeological and anthropological grounds, it has been speculated that these incomers slowly pushed away the
aboriginal residents [2]. It could be in that time when U6b
reached the south of the Iberian Peninsula from where it
was displaced to the north where it persists today. The
U6b and U6c diaspora also reached the Atlantic fringe
from where they sailed to the Canary Islands. Two autochthonous U6 lineages (U6b1 and U6c1), present today in
the islands, attest the survival of those aboriginal North
Africans until nowadays. The fact that these Canarian lineages have not been detected in Africa and that, in contrast
to the ubiquitous U6a and U6a1, the U6b and U6c lineages are scarcely spotted in present African populations,
may be clues of past important demographic movements
in this western area.

Methods
Complete mtDNA lineages
We have fully sequenced eleven mitochondrial lineages
belonging to different subclades of the North African subhaplogroup U6. DNA extraction, amplification and manual sequencing methods have already been described [8].
HVSI and RFLPs
A sample of 332 Andalusians, 1 Algerian Berber, 89
Moroccan Berbers, 23 individuals from Cape Verde, 96
from Madeira, 34 Mauritanians, 24 Moroccans and 12
Saharans were sequenced for the HVSI region from 16000
to 16390, and RFLP characterized as detailed [11,12]. In
order to distinguish putative U6 members, all these subjects and the U individuals from a sample of 1059 previously published [4,11,12,19,38], were amplified with
primers L3073/H3670 [8], and tested for the presence of
the 3348 MboI site [15], that characterizes all U6
members.

numbers: AF382008 and AF381980, respectively) and for
the coding region, H84 and H229 [18].
U6 phylogeographic analyses
In addition to our 611 samples, 41 populations where U6
haplotypes have been detected were included in our phylogeographic analysis (Table 2). Relationships among the
different U6 haplotypes were inferred using the reduced
median network algorithm [39]. To resolve reticulations,
the highly recurrent mutations 16129, 16189, 16311 and
16362 were less weighted.
Differences in accumulated mutations among U6 branches
The non-parametric test, resampling probability estimates
for the difference between the means of two independent
samples
(http://faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/Vassar
Stats.html), was used to calculate the significance level of
accumulated mutations between the different U6 subclades. The likelihood-ratio test, as implemented in TREEPUZZLE [21], was used to check between a uniform clock
or variable site model in the U6 tree.
U6 diversity and differentiation within and between areas
Arlequin package [40] was used to evaluate the U6 diversity within areas using nucleotide diversity (π) and segregating sites (S). Affinities between areas were obtained by
means of linearized FST [41].
Time estimates
For HVSI, the age of clusters or expansions was calculated
as the mean divergence ρ from inferred ancestral sequence
types [42] and converted into time by assuming that one
transition within np 16090–16365 corresponds to 20,180
years [43]. The standard deviation of the ρ estimator was
calculated as previously described [44].

For the complete sequences only substitutions in the coding region (15,447 nucleotides), excluding indels, were
taken into account. The mean number of substitutions per
site to the most recent common ancestor of each clade (ρ)
was estimated, and converted into time using two substitution rates: 1.7 × 10-8 [24] and 1.26 × 10-8 [45].
