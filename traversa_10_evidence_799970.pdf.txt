SHORT REPORT

Evidence for a new species of Cryptosporidium
infecting tortoises: Cryptosporidium ducismarci
Short report

Donato Traversa

Abstract
Cryptosporidiosis affects the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract of humans as well as of a wide range of companion,
farm, laboratory and wild animals. In the past few years, three independent studies have provided strong evidence for
the existence of a distinct Cryptosporidium species affecting tortoises and likely circulating in other reptile species as
well. A new Cryptosporidium genotype was firstly detected and genetically characterized in a marginated tortoise in
Italy in 2007 and named Cryptosporidium sp. ex Testudo marginata CrIT-20. The phylogenetic analysis of this isolate
indicated that this Cryptosporidium was unique and belonged to the intestinal clade. These findings were later on
confirmed by the detection of genetic homologies of isolates from a python and a chameleon from Spain and by
recent research in the United States. The latter study presented both the occurrence of intestinal lesions in a pancake
tortoise and a Russian tortoise and the genetic characterization of the isolates, together with the first pictures of the
endogenous stages of Cryptosporidium CrIT-20. Phylogenetic inference based on the sequences representing small
subunit of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (SSU) of these isolates confirmed the pathological findings because this
Cryptosporidium was related to the intestinal group and supported previous results in T. marginata from Italy. The
present scientific data on the Cryptosporidium CrIT-20 support its classification as a new species of Cryptosporidium
causing intestinal diseases in tortoises. Although further morphological (i.e. exogenous stages) and biological aspects
(i.e. complete host range) are yet to be elucidated, it is proposed that this Cryptosporidium is designated
Cryptosporidium ducismarci.
Findings
This report aims to propose a new species of Cryptosporidium isolated from reptiles. Cryptosporidium spp. are apicomplexan parasites of a wide range of animals. Due to
their biology, ecology and epidemiology these protozoa are
globally distributed. The vertebrate hosts become infected
through host-to-host contact or through ingestion of contaminated food or water [1,2]. The taxonomy of Cryptosporidium has been debated and several doubts and
uncertainties still exist. For a long time the only recognized
species have been Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium muris. However, numerous other isolates were present in animals but described only in the last decades [3].
The difficulties in addressing Cryptosporidium taxonomy
and in delineating new species mainly rely on the inability
to morphologically discriminate the biological stages and
on the difficulties in establishing monospecific experimental infections [3]. With the advent of nucleic acid-based

techniques and sequencing, important results have been
achieved in elucidating the taxonomical status of several
Cryptosporidium isolates and presently 19 distinct species
are known to affect amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals [2,4]. Three more species are hypothesized to infect
fishes but their status is not supported by sound biological
and molecular data [2,4]. Indeed, the genetic characterization, at one or more loci, of Cryptosporidium is a fundamental requirement to assess, at the species level, a new
Cryptosporidium isolate, along with the morphological
description of the biological stages and definition of the
host range, possibly based upon natural and experimental
infections [2,4].
Non-conventional animals, such as reptiles, have
increased in popularity as pets in developed countries, posing new concerns in relation to their pathogens. Despite
reptile cryptosporidiosis being recognized since the 1970s
[5] the first described species (i.e. Cryptosporidium serpentis), which is able to cause significant gastric pathologies in
snakes, has been genetically described only recently [6,7].

whose taxonomic identity has been debated for some time,
has been elevated as a proper species of intestinal pathogen
of lizards [2,8]. Beyond these two species, other isolates
have been reported sporadically and partially described
from different reptile species [9-11]. Indeed, our understanding of Cryptosporidium affecting chelonians is very
limited. The reports of Cryptosporidium spp. in Testudines
published in the last fifteen years relate to the infection in
the following species: radiated tortoise (Geochelone radiata), Indian star tortoise (Geochelone elegans), travancorelike tortoise (Indotestudo spp.), gopher tortoise (Gopherus
polyphemus), spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca), Egyptian tortoise (Testudo kleinmanni) and Hermann's tortoise
(Testudo hermanni) [9,10,12,13], but no comprehensive
data on multi-locus genetic characterization, infection site/s
or biological aspects were generated. For example, in a
study performed in 1997 in the United States, G. radiata, G.
elegans, Indotestudo sp. and G. polyphemus were found
positive at microscopic and immunofluorescence assays
[13] which, however, have important limits in terms of
specificity and do not allow a discrimination at the species/
genotype level. Another key example is provided by the
fatal intestinal pathology ascribed to Cryptosporidium spp.
in T. kleinmanni in 1998, which was not supported by the
genetic characterization of the pathogen [12].
In the past few years, three independent studies have provided strong evidence for the existence of a distinct Cryptosporidium species affecting tortoises and probably
circulating in other reptile species as well. The first clue for
the presence of this species was published in 2008: a
genetic isolate of Cryptosporidium has been found and
characterized from the faeces of a marginated tortoise
(Testudo marginata) living in an open enclosure of central
Italy [14]. A multi-locus genetic analysis via the characterization of informative regions within the genes encoding
the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) and the
small subunit of the nuclear ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA)
was conducted. The COWP and SSU sequences revealed
only ~80% and ~94% identity with the corresponding
sequences of the ubiquitous C. parvum (GenBank™ Accession Numbers XM_627569 and AF108864). Molecular and
phylogenetic analyses clearly demonstrated that this isolate
was an unique uncharacterized genotype, which has been
named Cryptosporidium sp. ex Testudo marginata CrIT-20.
The phylogenetic inference showed this isolate had a new
COWP sequence at the interface of the two major sister
groups (i.e. intestinal C. parvum and gastric C. muris). Further analysis of the COWP amino acid sequence for Cryptosporidium CrIT-20 showed partial common residues with
the gastric C. muris (79% nucleotide identity), as well as,
with avian Cryptosporidium baileyi (81% nucleotide identity) affecting the intestinal and respiratory tract of birds.
Also, phylogenetic analysis of the SSU rejected the possibility that Cryptosporidium CrIT-20 is the star tortoise gen-

otype [10,14] and confirmed that this genotype is
monophyletic with the intestinal Cryptosporidium species
[14]. More specifically, the phylogenetic trees showed
CrIT-20 genotype being at the bottom of the intestinal species, together with a diverse spectrum of reptilian and avian
genotypes and of C. baileyi [14]. The hypervariable region
of the SSU sequence of Cryptosporidium CrIT-20 (corresponding to the nucleotides 633-703 of C. parvum GenBank™ Accession Number AF108864) revealed high
genetic differences when compared with the same sequence
of other 28 Cryptosporidium species/genotypes, supporting
the CrIT-20 unique position [14].
A second distinct survey performed in 2008 showed the
presence of Cryptosporidium CrIT-20 in the faeces of a chameleon (Chamaeleo calyptratus) and a python (Python
regius) in Spain [11]. The neighbour-joining analysis of
partial SSU sequence data confirmed this Cryptosporidium
clustering with the species affecting the intestine but representing a distinct clade. Nonetheless, the characterization of
a fragment within the gene encoding the 70 kDa heat shock
protein indicated this Cryptosporidium to be related to the
gastric species, highlighting the need of further more-indepth study to identify the site of infection. Following the
first molecular detection of Cryptosporidium CrIT-20 and
its recognition as an unique genotype in T. marginata [14],
the Spanish researchers claimed that "a new Cryptosporidium species or genotype closely related to the main intestinal Cryptosporidium species was isolated from a
chameleon and a python. This one was found to be related
to a further new Cryptosporidium sp. recently identified in
a tortoise" [11]. Indeed, the molecular comparison of the
SSU sequences generated in Italy [14] and Spain [11]
showed a single nucleotidic difference (i.e. a thymine insertion) confirming that the Italian and the Spanish isolates
belonged to the same Cryptosporidium genotype. In fact,
given the nature of the SSU gene, such a mutation is not
taxonomically relevant given that different copies of the
SSU gene may have minor intraspecific differences in
Cryptosporidium spp. [3].
A third and last study provided new evidence for the existence of a novel species of Cryptosporidium in reptiles [15].
A group of researchers from the USA documented two
cases of fatal intestinal cryptosporidiosis in a Malacochersus tornieri (pancake tortoise) and in a Testudo horsfieldii
(Russian tortoise) and presented both the occurrence of gut
lesions and the genetic characterization of the isolate. The
necropsy of the two animals showed intestinal lesions consistent with cryptosporidiosis (i.e. mucosal alteration of the
lamina propria and its infiltration with lymphocytes, plasmacells and heterophils). This study [15] provided the first
pictures of the intestinal stages of this genetic type of Cryptosporidium. Specifically, numerous round Cryptosporidium stages, of 1-2 μm of diameter, were found closely
adhering to the brush border along the intestinal mucosa of

the Russian tortoise and, analogously, various Cryptosporidium stages with a diameter ranging from 1 to 5 μm were
present within the cytoplasm of intestinal cells and admixed
with mucous in the pancake tortoise as well. Given that
SSU is the most investigated genetic locus to address taxonomic questions within the Apicomplexa, including Cryptosporidium, this locus was characterized also for these
isolates [15]. Interestingly, the SSU region of the Cryptosporidium isolate from the M. tornieri and the T. horsfieldii in the USA [15] showed a 100% homology to the
sequence of Cryptosporidium CrIT-20 from Italy [14]. The
phylogenetic inference confirmed the pathological findings
(i.e. site of infection and disease), as the US Cryptosporidium was strongly related to the intestinal group of Cryptosporidium spp. and segregated in a monophyletic clade
suggesting its key role in the occurrence of the intestinal
infection [15].
Hence, the US study [10] provided the first evidence for
an association between the infection by the Cryptosporidium firstly named as Cryptosporidium CrIT-20 and intestinal infection and pathology in tortoises [14,15].
In summary, a new Cryptosporidium genotype was firstly
detected and genetically characterized in a marginated tortoise in Italy in 2007 and named Cryptosporidium sp. ex
Testudo marginata CrIT-20 with sequences from two loci
deposited in GenBank™ with the Accession numbers
EF519704.1 and EF547155.1[14]. No morphological nor
biological data on this isolate were generated but the phylogenetic analysis clearly suggested that this Cryptosporidium was unique and belonged to the intestinal group [14].
These findings were later on confirmed by the genetic
homologies detected in isolates from asymptomatic C.
calyptratus and P. regius from Spain [11], albeit including a
single nucleotidic mutation, considered of negligible relevance here, and, more importantly, by the phylogenetic resolution of the Cryptosporidium stages isolated from the
intestine of M. tornieri and T. horsfieldii tortoises in USA
[15]. On the basis of this knowledge such a Cryptosporidium sp. clearly parasitizes different tortoise species, which
appear to be the preferential hosts in which it can cause relevant intestinal pathologies. This Cryptosporidium has
been detected in lizards and snakes also [11], although its
pathogenic role in these other reptiles is unknown and it can
be argued that the infection is occasional. Although further
studies are necessary and more information on the morphology and biology of this new Cryptosporidium is required,
the multi-locus differences found between Cryptosporidium
CrIT-20 and of other established Cryptosporidium spp.,
which is a basic taxonomic requirement [3], confirm the
statement that this genotype is a distinct species.
Thus, the present biological and molecular data on the
Cryptosporidium CrIT-20 support to propose it as a new
species of Cryptosporidium causing intestinal pathologies
in tortoises.
