Abstract
Background: Profilins are critical to cytoskeletal dynamics in eukaryotes; however, little is known
about their viral counterparts. In this study, a poxviral profilin homolog, ectromelia virus strain
Moscow gene 141 (ECTV-PH), was investigated by a variety of experimental and bioinformatics
techniques to characterize its interactions with cellular and viral proteins.
Results: Profilin-like proteins are encoded by all orthopoxviruses sequenced to date, and share
over 90% amino acid (aa) identity. Sequence comparisons show highest similarity to mammalian
type 1 profilins; however, a conserved 3 aa deletion in mammalian type 3 and poxviral profilins
suggests that these homologs may be more closely related. Structural analysis shows that ECTVPH can be successfully modelled onto both the profilin 1 crystal structure and profilin 3 homology
model, though few of the surface residues thought to be required for binding actin, poly(L-proline),
and PIP2 are conserved. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry identified two proteins that
interact with ECTV-PH within infected cells: alpha-tropomyosin, a 38 kDa cellular actin-binding
protein, and the 84 kDa product of vaccinia virus strain Western Reserve (VACV-WR) 148, which
is the truncated VACV counterpart of the orthopoxvirus A-type inclusion (ATI) protein. Western
and far-western blots demonstrated that the interaction with alpha-tropomyosin is direct, and
immunofluorescence experiments suggest that ECTV-PH and alpha-tropomyosin may colocalize to
structures that resemble actin tails and cellular protrusions. Sequence comparisons of the poxviral
ATI proteins show that although full-length orthologs are only present in cowpox and ectromelia
viruses, an ~ 700 aa truncated ATI protein is conserved in over 90% of sequenced orthopoxviruses.
Immunofluorescence studies indicate that ECTV-PH localizes to cytoplasmic inclusion bodies
formed by both truncated and full-length versions of the viral ATI protein. Furthermore,
colocalization of ECTV-PH and truncated ATI protein to protrusions from the cell surface was
observed.
Conclusion: These results suggest a role for ECTV-PH in intracellular transport of viral proteins
or intercellular spread of the virus. Broader implications include better understanding of the virushost relationship and mechanisms by which cells organize and control the actin cytoskeleton.

Background
Profilins are critical to the cytoskeletal dynamics required
for determination of cell shape and size, adhesion, cytokinesis, contractile force, morphogenesis and intracellular
transport. Members of the profilin family of proteins are
known to be key regulators of actin polymerization in
eukaryotic organisms ranging from yeast to mammals, but
little is known about profilin homologs found in the poxviridae and paramyxoviridae virus families [1,2].
Poxviruses are complex viruses with large doublestranded DNA genomes that encode many proteins not
required for virus replication in tissue culture [3]. Some
non-essential genes are involved in blocking host
immune functions, while others function in pathogenesis-related pathways [4,5]. Most poxvirus genes, in fact,
are not universally conserved and, as might be expected,
some are found only in phylogenetically related subgroups of the poxvirus family. The poxvirus gene that
encodes a homolog of cellular profilin is such a gene and
appears to have been acquired by an ancestral orthopoxvirus since it is present in all fully sequenced orthopoxvirus genomes (79 to date; [6,7]), but absent from all other
poxviruses. All of the poxvirus profilin homologs share
90% or greater protein sequence identity (data not
shown).
Cellular profilins are believed to interact with three types
of cellular molecules: actin monomers, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and poly(L-proline)
sequences [8]. Profilins are thought to modulate actin filament dynamics (polymerization and depolymerization)
via direct binding to actin through an actin-binding
domain as well as by modulation of other actin-binding
proteins [9]. Over 50 proteins have been characterized as
profilin ligands [8]. Numerous proteins interact with profilin directly through the poly(L-proline) binding
domain, while others may bind indirectly to profilin-regulated complexes or have their activities altered by these
complexes [8]. Profilins also assist in signalling between
cell membrane receptors and the intracellular microfilament system by their interaction with phosphoinositides
[10]. Though many of the interactions with phosphoinositides and profilin-binding proteins remain poorly
understood, profilin has been implicated in diverse processes involving actin, nuclear export receptors, endocytosis regulators, Rac and Rho effectors, and putative
transcription factors [8].
In contrast to its cellular homolog, the vaccinia virus profilin-homolog (VACV-PH) binds actin only weakly, has
no detectable affinity for poly(L-proline), and, although it
has a similar affinity for PIP2 [11], does not show significant binding to phosphatidyl inositol (PI) or inositol triphosphate (IP3) [12]. Little, therefore, is known about

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/76

poxviral profilin function. However, RNA interference
knockdown studies of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
profilin homolog showed that absence of this viral profilin had a small effect on reducing viral macromolecule
synthesis and strongly inhibited maturation of progeny
virions, cell fusion, and induction of stress fibers [1]. The
RSV profilin homolog has been found to interact with RSV
phosphoprotein P and nucleocapsid protein N. These
interactions are thought to help activate viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase [1].
Although the importance of actin filaments in poxvirus
motion (and therefore cell-to-cell spread) is well understood, the specific interactions involved are not yet wellcharacterized [13-16]. Although viral profilin binds actin
only weakly, its significant sequence similarity to cellular
profilin suggested that it was a possible component in this
pathway. Using the murine smallpox model, ectromelia
virus, we initiated a search for proteins that interact with
the ectromelia profilin homolog, ECTV-PH.
Herein we present evidence that ECTV-PH interacts with
cellular α-tropomyosin and both full-length and truncated viral ATI proteins in infected cells and colocalizes to
inclusion bodies and protrusions from the cells at putative actin-like tails. Many of the residues important for
binding actin and other known mammalian substrates are
not conserved in ECTV-PH; however, the ECTV-PH protein can be modelled onto the related structures of mammalian profilins 1 and 3.

Results and discussion
Sequence analysis of profilin
We began our study of ECTV-PH by comparing it to various cellular profilin proteins using multiple sequence
alignments. The mouse type 1 profilins appear to be most
similar (~ 31% aa identity) to their orthopoxviral counterpart; mouse type 2 and type 3 profilins are ~ 25% and ~
23% identical to the viral protein respectively (Figure 1A).
An alignment of ECTV-PH and type 1, 2 and 3 profilins
from mouse, human, cow, and rat showed that sequence
identity conservation between each of these mammalian
sequences compared to ectromelia sequence was similar
to the reported percent identities for mouse profilins and
ECTV-PH (within 1.5%; data not shown). Though analysis using a maximum likelihood tree (Figure 1B) supports
these findings, another phylogenetic tool, maximum parsimony, places the poxviral homolog slightly closer to the
type 3 profilins [2]. Although the first two methods are
considered to be more reliable than maximum parsimony
analysis, another piece of evidence – a shared 3-aa deletion in the viral and type 3 profilin genes – supports the
maximum parsimony result. These data, apparently contradictory, could be explained by an ancestral orthopoxvirus acquiring a type 3 profilin gene from its host, and

subsequent evolutionary selection leading to a slightly
higher similarity with type 1 profilin.
Structural Analysis of the ECTV-PH
To provide further insight into viral profilin function,
three-dimensional structural modelling of ECTV-PH was
carried out. As discussed above, the sequence data indicates that ECTV-PH is closer to human profilin 1 (31%
sequence identity) than 3 (23%). However, previous work
has classified ECTV-PH with profilin 3 [2]. SWISSMODEL [17] was used to model the structures of both
ECTV-PH and human profilin 3 (NP_001025057.1), and
each of these structures was subsequently compared by
superposition to the crystal structure of human profilin 1

(PDB ID: 1FIL) [18]. We chose to show all comparisons to
human profilin 1 since it is the only one of the three proteins that has a crystal structure in the PDB database (Figures 2, 3, 4). According to the root mean square deviation
(RMSD) values (Table 1), ECTV-PH is closest to human
profilin 3 with an RMSD value of 0.500 over 132 atoms;
however, the RMSD value for human profilin 1 is 0.551
over 132 atoms and, therefore, cannot be ruled out as the
closest homolog of ECTV-PH. The structure of ECTV-PH
was also compared to the crystal structure of the human
profilin 2b protein (1D1J chain D; [19]) as well as a homology model of human profilin 2a; however, these structures showed significantly lower structural similarity to
ECTV-PH (RMSD 0.95 over 130 atoms; data not shown).

Interestingly, the primary sequence of type 2 profilins is ~
62% identical to type 1 profilins and ~ 40% identical to
type 3 profilins, yet the structural similarity is relatively
low (RMSD ~ 0.99 and ~ 0.98, respectively). When profilin 1 and 3 are compared they have a similar % identity (~

43%) but much greater structural similarity (RMSD ~
0.41). The structure of ECTV-PH was also modelled using
the Robetta protein structure prediction server [20-22]
and was found to be nearly identical in structure to the
model created by SWISS-MODEL. Slight differences in the

or function; 20 of the 21 residues important for actin
binding and 5 of the 6 important for poly(L-proline)
binding in both human profilin 1 and 3 are not conserved

indicate the loop located between beta-strands 5 and 6 of
human profilin 1 implicated in PIP2 binding that is reduced in
size in ECTV-PH.

Comparisons with human profilin regarding PIP2 binding
are more difficult. A range of binding affinities has been
reported for human profilin 1 (0.13 μM < Kd < 35 μM)
depending on the experimental method used [2,10,23].
Most recently, a dissociation constant of 985 μM was
obtained using a relatively more biologically relevant
assay that employed sub-micellar concentrations of PIP2
[10]. Because of this uncertainty in the literature, it is difficult to quantitatively compare the affinities of ECTV-PH
and human profilin 1 for PIP2. Of the 6 amino acids
important for PIP2 binding in human profilin 1 and 3, 5
residues are not conserved in ECTV-PH (Figure 4, Table 2)
suggesting that it should have little or no binding affinity
to PIP2. Given that Machesky observed a significant binding affinity of ECTV-PH for PIP2, (Kd = 1.3 μM) [11], it is
probable that nearby residues contribute to PIP2 binding.
The loop located between beta-strands 5 and 6 of human
profilin 1 has been weakly implicated in PIP2 binding
[24], and is substantially smaller in ECTV-PH (Figure 4).
It has previously been suggested that a smaller, less obtrusive loop could contribute to a lower binding affinity to
PIP2 [24], and the observed data would seem to fit this
hypothesis.

3-dimensional spatial locations of two loop regions were
the only differences observed between the Robetta and
SWISS-MODEL models of ECTV-PH (data not shown).

Thus, despite low sequence similarity and lack of conserved binding residues for actin, poly(L-proline), and
PIP2, a relatively high level of structural similarity between
viral and mammalian profilin is maintained. Further studies may show this structural conservation reflects functional conservation or, alternatively, adaptation of a
stable protein structure by the virus for new functionality.

Human profilin contains 3 major binding domains for
actin, poly(L-proline), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5bisphosphate (PIP2). While the overall tertiary structure
of ECTV-PH is highly conserved compared to both human
profilins 1 and 3, with the closest relationship to human
profilin 3, the amino acids comprising the binding
regions on ECTV-PH are almost entirely different. ECTVPH has been previously observed to have a low affinity for
both actin and poly(L-proline) compared to human profilin 1 [11]. Our structural analysis supports this observation as most amino acids critical for binding in human
profilin are not conserved in ECTV-PH in terms of identity

ECTV-PH-interacting proteins
The first experimental step utilized immunoprecipitations
to identify proteins interacting with ECTV-PH in tissue
culture cells. BS-C-1 cells were infected with a recombinant VACV strain WR vTF7-3 expressing a T7 polymerase, and then transfected with a plasmid containing the
gene of interest, a Histidine (His)-tagged ECTV-PH. Late
in infection (after 16 h), proteins were extracted from the
cell and subjected to a penta-His antibody to selectively
precipitate ECTV-PH and any associated proteins. Interacting proteins were affinity captured on Protein-G agarose and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. The resulting gel

is presented in Figure 5. Lane 1 shows a negative control
using cell lysate containing no ECTV-PH (bands are proteins that interact non-specifically with precipitating
agents.) Four bands appear in lane 2 that are not present
in lane 1; of these, the 16 kDa and 28 kDa bands are
unbound ECTV-PH monomers and dimers, respectively.
We have shown by western blotting that this protein can
maintain a dimerized form, despite the denaturing conditions of an SDS-PAGE gel (data not shown). The 38 and
84 kDa bands are proteins that interact with ECTV-PH.
These were excised from the gel and identified via mass
spectrometry as VACV-WR 148, an 84 kDa protein which
belongs to the orthopoxvirus A-type inclusion (ATI) protein family (protein accession no. AA089427.1), and αtropomyosin, a 38 kDa cellular actin-binding protein
(protein accession no. AAA61226). Although lane 2 is
slightly under-loaded relative to lane 1, the non-specific
interacting proteins are generally comparable between the
two lanes. It is interesting, however, that some of the proteins appear to migrate slightly faster in lane 2; this may
represent differential protein processing in virus infected
cells.

As tropomyosin is an actin-binding protein and viral profilin is known to bind actin (though weakly in the case of
viral profilin [11]), two additional investigations were
performed that demonstrate the tropomyosin-profilin
interaction is direct. Firstly, a western blot of the immunoprecipitated ECTV-PH sample with a polyclonal anti-actin
primary antibody failed to detect actin (Figure 6). Lanes 1
and 2 contain purified rabbit muscle actin and starting
cell lysate from which ECTV-PH and ECTV-PH-interacting
proteins were isolated, respectively. Strong immunoreactive bands at 42 kDa are observed in both lanes, indicating
significant levels of actin in the initial cell lysate. Lane 3
contains proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with ECTVPH; no immunoreactive band at 42 kDa indicates that if
actin is present, levels are below the detection threshold of
the western blot. These data agree with findings (discussed earlier) that the viral profilin homolog has a low
binding affinity for actin [9]. The immunoreactive band at
17 kDa corresponds to the MW of Protein G (precipitating
agent), indicating that it retains some capacity to bind to
antibodies even after separation by SDS-PAGE and transfer to blotting membrane.

Another possibility was that interaction occurred through
this His-tag on the ECTV-PH protein. A far-western blot
was performed, using nickel-column purified ECTV-PH
probed with porcine muscle tropomyosin protein and
detected with mouse monoclonal anti-tropomyosin IgG1
primary antibody (Figure 7, lane 2). Since no tropomyosin bound to a His-tagged control protein or BSA, we
concluded that the interaction is not due to the His-tag
(Figure 7, lanes 4 and 5).

ruses encode an ATI protein that is expressed late in infection at approximately the same time as the profilin
homolog [25]. ATI proteins are present either as a fulllength protein, found in cowpox virus (CPXV) and ECTV,
or a truncated form of the protein found in most other
orthopoxviruses. Full-length ATI proteins form large bodies in the cytoplasm that contain intracellular mature virions (IMV), and are thought to be important in survival
and dissemination of the virions [26,27]. Although the
function of truncated ATI proteins is poorly understood,
in VACV they do associate with mature virions [26], and
the conservation of these truncated genes suggests the protein does confer an advantage to the virus during its life
cycle.

ATI proteins are present in over 90% of the orthopoxvirus

60% longer than the highly conserved truncated version.
The longest ATI protein, 1284 aa in length, is encoded by
CPXV strain Brighton Red. The first ~ 600 residues, conserved in the truncated version, are followed by a series of
10 tandem peptide repeats, each 24–32 aa long, and a carboxyl (C)-terminal region of ~ 380 residues (Figure 8).

absent from several monkeypox and VACV genomes, and
is, therefore, not essential to virus replication. However,
the widespread conservation of the truncated portion
indicates that this gene likely encodes a beneficial and
selectable trait.
Localization of the ECTV-PH and VACV-WR A-type
inclusion proteins in infected cells
To determine if ECTV-PH and VACV-WR 148 (a truncated
ATI protein) colocalize in poxvirus-infected cells, hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged VACV-WR 148 (VACV-ATI) and
Myc-tagged ECTV-PH were co-expressed with the vTF7-3
transient expression system and visualized by indirect
immunofluorescence. Since anti-His antibodies are
known to cross-react with cellular proteins, a Myc-tagged
ECTV-PH expression plasmid was constructed for use with
the vTF7-3 virus in place of the His-ECTV-PH. A mockinfected control cell stained with both anti-HA and antiMyc antibodies as well as 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) DNA staining is shown in Figure 9A; very little
background antibody binding is seen. Figure 9B shows an
infected cell subjected to DAPI staining (blue fluorescence
indicates the nucleus). In the infected cell, both VACV-ATI
(Figure 9C; green fluorescence) and ECTV-PH (Figure 9D;
red fluorescence) are visible throughout the cytoplasm.
However, several regions have brighter immunofluorescence signals for both proteins; the merge view suggests
that these are sites of colocalization (Figure 9E arrows 1–
3). Truncated ATI proteins have been observed to aggregate and form small, irregularly-shaped, unstable inclusion bodies [28]. The morphology of the putative regions
of colocalization in Figure 9E (arrows 1 and 2) matches
this description. Two extranuclear regions stained for
DNA (Figure 9B arrows 1 and 2) overlap with the
observed bodies. If these are indeed unstable inclusion
bodies formed by aggregated truncated ATI proteins, this
evidence suggests that they are still able to sequester intracellular mature virions (IMV). In contrast, the viral factory
indicated by arrow 4, a discrete area in the cytoplasm containing actively replicating viral DNA, does not colocalize
to the putative inclusion bodies. Finally, ECTV-PH and
VACV-ATI also appear to colocalize to a structure near the
cell periphery (Figure 9E arrow 3), resembling protrusions
from the cell surface induced by cell-associated virions
(CEV) during infection.
Localization of the ECTV-PH and ECTV-Moscow A-type
inclusion proteins in infected cells
To characterize the interaction between ECTV-PH and
full-length poxvirus ATI proteins, Myc-tagged ECTV-PH
and HA-tagged ECTV-Moscow-128 A-type inclusion
(ECTV-ATI) proteins were overexpressed and localized in

BS-C-1 cells using the same vTF-3 transient expression system and antibodies as previously described. ECTV-ATI has
been previously shown to form large, round inclusion
bodies in the cytoplasm of the host cell [29]. These bodies
are clearly visible in Figure 10C. Unlike VACV-ATI, the
ECTV-ATI protein appears to be completely localized to
these inclusions in the cytoplasm, which are excluded
from the nucleus as seen by DAPI staining (Figure 10B).
This complete localization to the inclusion bodies supports earlier findings that ATI proteins are associated only
with IMVs [19]. Though ECTV-PH also largely colocalizes
to these inclusion bodies (Figure 10D), some of the protein remains distributed throughout the cytoplasm. This
suggests that ECTV-PH may also interact with other proteins in the cytoplasm, such as cellular tropomyosin (as
previously demonstrated in Figures 5 and 7). Viral DNA
(Figure 10B arrows 1 and 2) does not appear to localize to
the inclusion bodies.
Taken together, the results of these two immunofluorescence experiments suggest that ECTV-PH localizes to

inclusion bodies formed by both truncated and fulllength versions of the viral ATI protein in the cytoplasm of
the host cell. As the amino (N) terminus and first two tandem repeats are the only domains these proteins share, it
is reasonable to conclude that this shared region contains
the site of interaction with the profilin homolog. In addition, the colocalization of viral profilin and truncated ATI
protein to protrusions from the cell surface suggests that
these proteins may together be involved in intercellular
transport of the virus.
Localization of the ECTV-PH and cellular tropomyosin
proteins in infected cells
The role of tropomyosin is well understood in skeletal
muscle, where it regulates the actin-myosin interaction,
controlling muscle contraction. However, the role of tropomyosin in the cytoskeleton has remained elusive. Actin
filaments vary in composition due to utilization of distinct isoforms of both actin and tropomyosin, which are
temporally and spatially regulated [30]. It has been demonstrated that tropomyosin isoforms differentially regulate actin filament function and stability [30]. As ECTVPH binds tropomyosin and may be involved in actin

polymerization, we investigated the localization of ECTVPH and cellular tropomyosin in poxvirus-infected cells
using indirect immunofluorescence.

Summary of the Immunofluorescence Results
Our immunofluorescence results show that full-length
ECTV-ATI and ECTV-PH colocalize to inclusion bodies,
where IMVs are known to be sequestered [27]. Truncated
ATI proteins do not form stable inclusion bodies, and the
structures formed are seen to be small and irregularly
shaped in our study in agreement with previous work
[28], yet we observed some colocalization of ECTV-PH
and VACV-ATI proteins to putative inclusion bodies and
protrusions on the cell surface. IMV particles have been
shown to travel along microtubules and form intracellular
enveloped virus (IEV) particles that then travel to the cell
surface [15]. Our results suggest that profilin may be
involved with inclusion bodies and IMV transport.
Though the immunofluorescence data for tropomyosin
are less conclusive, it is possible that tropomyosin and
ECTV-PH are also involved in release and/or intercellular
transport of viral particles. Because ECTV-PH was overexpressed using a T7 promoter, it is possible that the protein was more widely distributed than when it is expressed

Intriguingly, some ECTV-PH and the endogenous cellular
tropomyosin appear to colocalize in higher concentrations to structures resembling actin tails (Figure 11E,
arrows labelled 1); these are known to support extracellular enveloped virus (EEV)-containing protrusions from
the cell surface (Figure 11E, arrows labelled 2) that are
important for the intercellular spread of poxviruses [31].
ECTV-PH (but not tropomyosin) also localizes in high
concentrations to structures resembling inclusion bodies
(arrows labelled 3). These are presumably aggregates of
the truncated ATI protein encoded by vTF7-3, the recombinant vaccinia virus used in the transient expression system. Though similar to the inclusion bodies formed when
the truncated VACV-ATI is overexpressed (Figure 9E
arrows 1 and 2), those seen here are more spherical, suggesting that overexpression of the protein may affect the
morphology of the putative inclusion bodies.

Merge

Endogenous cellular tropomyosin was relatively uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm in the mockinfected control cells (Figure 11A; green fluorescence). In
the infected cell, both tropomyosin (11C, green fluorescence) and ECTV-PH (11D, red fluorescence) were also
observed throughout the cytoplasm. Neither is present in
the nucleus, as is shown by DAPI DNA staining (11B; blue
fluorescence). It is possible that tropomyosin and ECTVPH interact with each other in the cytoplasm and/or with
different cytoplasmic proteins, though due to the widespread distribution of both, no definite conclusions are
possible.

at endogenous levels, in effect weakening the visualization of concentrated ECTV-PH and making interpretation
of results more difficult.

late the activities of other actin-binding proteins makes
the viral homolog a candidate for involvement in these
processes.

In a previous study by Blasco et al., cells infected with a
deletion mutant of VACV-WR lacking the profilin
homolog showed normal plaque formation, infectivity,
and IMV/EEV production, movement, and release [32].
This study also showed by fluorescence microscopy that
viral profilin does not associate with actin filaments
within the infected cell. In agreement with this, we did not
detect an interaction between actin and ECTV-PH. However, we did observe associations between ECTV-PH, tropomyosin and ATI proteins at cellular protrusions and
putative actin tails. It is possible that VACV profilin used
in the Blasco study has functional differences from ECTVPH used in our study. It would be interesting to perform a
similar deletion study with ECTV-PH and visualize viral
particle movement using confocal microscopy or
immuno-electron microscopy. Although the profilin protein sequences are 90% identical between VACV and
ECTV, many genes in the large poxvirus genome are different, including the ATI protein that is full-length in ECTV
and truncated in VACV. Another possibility is that VACV
profilin is more connected to processes involving PIP2
than those involving actin (proposed by Machesky et al.
and Blasco et al. [11,32]). Our structural analysis (discussed earlier) does not dismiss this possibility, though
most of the PIP2 binding residues in the active site are not
conserved. Since both the Blasco study and our study were
done in cell culture, it is possible that during the natural
infection of the host, the associations we observed
between ECTV-PH, tropomyosin and ATI protein may
become important in actin-associated events. Although
not necessarily required for viral particle production and
movement, profilin may have a role to play when present
in this context.

Our investigation provides evidence that suggests viral
profilin plays a role in protein or viral particle localization. We show that ECTV-PH associates with viral ATI protein in immunoprecitations of infected cells.
Furthermore, immunofluorescence studies show strong
colocalization of ECTV-PH with full-length and truncated
ATI proteins in inclusion bodies. In the case of truncated
ATI protein, colocalization with ECTV-PH also occurs at
protrusions from the cell surface. The formation or utilization of these structures that are involved in the protection and spread of the virus may be facilitated by the
action of the profilin homolog.

Taken as a whole, the immunofluorescence results support the idea that ECTV-PH may have some role in intracellular transport of viral proteins in the cytoplasm or
intercellular spread of the virus. However, further studies
are needed to demonstrate these functions, as well as confirm the colocalization of ECTV and tropomyosin within
the cell. Subsequent immunofluorescence studies examining the association of ECTV-PH, tropomyosin, and ATI
proteins with viral membrane proteins and actin, and
examining the movement of these proteins in infected
cells would provide valuable insight.

Conclusion
In this study, we characterize a profilin homolog, ECTVPH, encoded by ectromelia virus. Poxviruses are known to
utilize the cellular cytoskeleton for the transport of virions
and viral components during viral infection, although the
specific mechanisms are not well understood. The ability
of cellular profilin to bind directly to actin and to modu-

ECTV-PH also directly associates with cellular tropomyosin, an actin-binding protein and regulator of actin filament function and stability. The extent to which ECTV-PH
and tropomyosin colocalize in immunoflourescence studies is less clear; however, our results raise the possibility
that ECTV-PH and tropomyosin may associate at protrusions from the cell surface and putative actin tails. These
data support a potential role for these proteins in intracellular transport of IMVs or viral proteins, or intercellular
spread of the virus.
Three-dimensional modelling showed that although the
viral profilin homolog shares only 31% and 23% amino
acid identity with mammalian profilin 1 and 3 respectively, the overall structure of the proteins are very similar.
The lack of conservation of residues known in human profilin to be involved in binding of actin, poly(L-proline),
and PIP2 suggests that the function of the poxviral
homolog may be quite different from cellular profilins
and illustrates how genes that are hijacked by viruses may
be rapidly modified and apparently new functions
selected for (e.g. binding of viral ATI protein). It is interesting that although the primary sequences have diverged
considerably, the structures have to a large degree been
maintained. This suggests that there is an inherent value
to a stable protein structure that can support a variety of
functional interaction surfaces. Also, since cellular profilins are known to interact with multiple protein and phosphoinositide ligands, it is possible that the poxvirus
profilin homologs have maintained some of these interactions that were not detected in our immunoprecipitation
experiment. Low protein concentration or either weak or
transient interactions could result in such interactions
being undetected. The conservation of profilin-like genes
in current orthopoxviruses (greater than 90% aa identity)
indicates that these proteins perform an important function during viral infection. Further characterization of the
mechanisms by which poxviruses manipulate the
cytoskeleton will not only result in a deeper understanding of the virus-host relationship, but may also give a fresh

insight into mechanisms by which uninfected cells organize and control the actin cytoskeleton.

Methods
Sequence Analysis
All poxviral protein sequences were obtained from the
Viral Orthologous Clusters (VOCs) database [6,7]. Other
sequences were retrieved from GenBank: human profilin
1 (NP_005013), profilin 2 isoform a (NP_444252), profilin 2 isoform b (NP_002619), and profilin 3
(NP_001025057); Bos taurus profilin 1 (NP_001015592),
profilin 2 (Q09430), and profilin 3 (NP_001071413);
Mus musculus profilin 1 (NP_035202), profilin 2
(NP_062283), and profilin 3 (NP_083579); Rattus norvegicus profilin 1 (NP_071956), profilin 2 (NP_110500),
and profilin 3 (XP_001065833). Multiple sequence alignments and percent identity tables were created with BaseBy-Base [33] using the T-Coffee alignment algorithm [34]
with minor manual adjustments to the profilin alignment
based on structural analysis.

Phylogenetic trees were constructed from 14 aligned profilin amino acid sequences using the PHYLIP package
[35]. The maximum likelihood tree was calculated with
the "proml" program, using the Jones-Taylor-Thornton
model of amino acid substitution [36], with a constant
rate of change across sites, and allowing global rearrangements. The input sequence order was randomized 5 times,
and from the resulting 5 output trees, the highest-scoring
tree was selected. The maximum parsimony tree (data not
shown) was calculated with the "protpars" program, using
ordinary parsimony, with all sites equally weighted. Input
order was again randomized 5 times, and the best tree
chosen from the 5 trials. Bootstrap values were created
using "seqboot" to generate 100 bootstrap samples of the
input sequences. For both maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood, trees were computed for all bootstrap
data sets using the same parameters as the original data;
the consensus trees and bootstrap values were calculated
using "consense". Trees were drawn with the "drawtree"
program, and edited with the Xfig Drawing Program for
the X Window System [37].
Homology modelling
The ECTV-PH primary protein sequence (NP_671660.1)
was submitted to the SWISS-MODEL [17] server using the
"First Approach" mode with default settings. The server
identified 4 profilin proteins as having a high degree of
sequence identity with ECTV-PH based on BLASTp results
[38]. These 4 profilins were then used for the ECTV-PH
structural model: human platelet profilin 1 (high salt;
1FIL; [18], human platelet profilin 1 (low salt; 1FIK; [18]),
human profilin NMR structure (1PFL; [39]), and bovine
profilin complexed with beta-actin (1HLU; [40]). The
homology model of ECTV-PH was superimposed and
subsequently compared to the crystal structure of human
profilin 1 (1FIL) using the MatchMaker feature of the Chi-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/76

mera visualization software [41]. The structural model of
ECTV-PH was confirmed by modelling the primary
sequence of ECTV-PH using the Robetta protein structure
prediction server [20-22] using the human platelet profilin crystal structure as a template (1CJF chain A; [42]).
The primary protein sequence of the human profilin 3
protein (NP_001025057.1) was also modelled with
SWISS-MODEL [17] using default settings. The SWISSMODEL server modelled the structure of human profilin
3 based on 4 profilin proteins; human platelet profilin 1
(low salt; 1FIK; [18]), human platelet profilin 1 (high salt;
1FIL; [18]), human profilin 1 NMR structure (1PFL; [39]),
and human platelet profilin 1 complexed with a prolinerich ligand (1CF0; [42]). A structural model for human
profilin 2a (data not shown) was created using SWISSMODEL in the same manner as both ECTV-PH, and
human profilin 3, using the following protein crystal
structures as templates: human profilin 2b (1D1J; [19])
and bovine profilin complexed with beta-actin (1HLU;
[40]).
Expression and purification of recombinant proteins
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was utilized to
amplify the target genes from ECTV-Moscow DNA and
incorporate a primer sequence encoding a 6-histidine tag
onto the 5' end of each gene. PCR products were cloned
into the pENTR/SD/D-Topo entry vector, and then subcloned into the pDEST14 destination vector to generate
expression clones as per the manufacturer's instructions
(Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). A
recombinant VACV strain WR vTF7-3 (ATCC VR-2153;
[43]) expressing a T7 polymerase was used to transiently
overexpress His-tagged ECTV-PH in BS-C-1 cells. Tissue
culture reagents were obtained from Gibco BRL Inc.
(Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The African green monkey kidney cell line BS-C-1 (ATCC CCL 26), was grown in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented
with 10% newborn bovine serum, 50 U/ml penicillin, 50
μg/ml streptomycin and GlutaMAX-II (Gibco). BS-C-1
cells were lysed using a French Pressure Cell (American
Instrument Company, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA) and
His-tagged ECTV-PH was purified using a Ni-NTA column
(Invitrogen Life Technologies) with a Bio-Rad Biologic
low-pressure chromatography system and a 0–300 mM
imidazole elution gradient (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA,
USA). EDTA and glycerol were added to the fractions
(final concentrations of 1 mM and 10%, respectively) to
prevent degradation and aggregation of the proteins,
which were then stored at -20°C. Protein concentrations
were determined using Bradford Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich,
Oakville, ON, Canada) following manufacturer's instructions.

were visualized and digitally photographed using the
Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (model 9120, Li-COR
Biosciences, Lincoln, NB, USA).
Immunoprecipitation
BS-C-1 cells were seeded in 9 × 100 mm tissue culture
dishes and grown to 90% confluency (approximately 6.3
× 107 cells/dish). Cells were infected with a recombinant
VACV strain WR vTF7-3 (ATCC VR-2153) expressing a T7
polymerase, at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10,
and then transfected with 25 μg ECTV-Moscow 141 (Histagged) pDEST14 Expression Clone plasmid DNA per 100
mm dish. After 16 h incubation, cells were washed with
PBS and lysed with non-denaturing lysis buffer (50 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 1% Triton ×-100, 10 mM
imidazole) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Cat #
1836153, Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA).
After centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 10 min at 4°C, the
lysate supernatant fluid was added to 15 μl Protein G-Plus
Agarose (Cat # sc2002, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA, USA) to pre-clear the extract. Following rotation
of the tube at 4°C for 1 h, the Protein G-Plus Agarose was
pelleted by centrifuging at 1000 × g for 1 min and PentaHis Antibody (Cat # 34660, mouse Penta-His Antibody
IgG1, QIAGEN) was added to the supernatant fluid to a
final concentration of 5 μg/ml. The tube was rotated for 3
h at 4°C before 60 μl Protein G-Plus Agarose was added

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/76

and the incubation continued overnight. After ~ 16 h, the
Protein G-Plus Agarose was pelleted by centrifuging at
1000 × g for 1 min and the supernatant fluid was
removed. The agarose was washed 4 times in 3 ml of wash
buffer (0.1% Triton ×-100, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300
mM NaCl) and once with PBS. The pellet was resuspended in 80 μl of 1 × NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Cat #
NP0007, Invitrogen Life Technologies) containing 10 mM
DTT (dithiothreitol), then heated to 70°C for 10 min and
subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blot. The control
used herring sperm DNA instead of pDEST14 expression
clone DNA.
Mass spectrometry
Coomassie blue-stained bands were excised from an SDSPAGE gel using a new scalpel for each band and were prepared and analyzed by the Genome BC Proteomics Centre
(Victoria, BC, Canada). The gel slices were subjected to an
automated in-gel trypsin digestion, and the proteins
obtained were analyzed by MALDI-TOF using a VoyagerDE STR mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA). The Mascot search engine [44] was used
to identify the primary protein sequences of the samples
from the mass spectrometry data by searching primary
sequence databases.
Far western analysis
2 μg each of porcine muscle tropomyosin (Cat # T2400,
Sigma-Aldrich), ECTV-PH (His-tagged, metal chelation
chromatography purified), rabbit muscle actin (Cat #
A2522, Sigma-Aldrich), RelA (His-tagged bacterial protein, a gift from Dr. Edward Ishiguro, Dept. Biochemistry
and Microbiology, University of Victoria), and Bovine
Serum Albumin (BSA; Cat # A9647, Sigma-Aldrich) were
separated by SDS-PAGE. After transfer to a nitrocellulose
membrane, proteins were refolded by a denaturation and
renaturation cycle in guanidine hydrochloride as
described by Rea et al. [45]. The membrane was washed
twice in 50 ml of denaturation buffer (6 M guanidine
hydrochloride, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 10
mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for 10 min at
4°C with gentle agitation. The denaturation buffer was
diluted 1:1 with basic buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50
mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40)
and the membrane was washed as before. This dilution
and wash cycle was repeated four more times until the
final wash contained 175 mM guanidinium hydrochloride. Porcine muscle tropomyosin was used as the probe
protein, and was diluted to a final concentration of 20 μg/
ml in interaction buffer (1% nonfat dry milk in basic
buffer, 5% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF) and was incubated with
the membrane for 5 h at 4°C with gentle agitation. The
tropomyosin solution was removed and the membrane
was washed 4 × 10 min in buffer #1 (0.2% Triton ×-100 in
PBS) at 4°C with gentle agitation, followed by 2 × 10 min
in buffer #2 (0.2% Triton ×-100, 100 mM KCl in PBS) at

Odyssey Blocking Buffer and PBS + 0.2% TWEEN-20,
overnight at 4°C with gentle agitation. The next day the
primary antibody was removed and the membrane was
washed 4 × 5 min with PBS + 0.1% TWEEN-20. The membrane was then exposed to rabbit anti-mouse IgG (H&L)
IRDye 800 conjugate secondary antibody (Cat #

1:2500 dilution for 1 h at 4°C with gentle agitation. The
secondary antibody was removed and the membrane was
washed 4 × 5 min with PBS + 0.1% TWEEN-20 and once
with PBS alone. The blot was visualized and digitally photographed using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LiCOR Biosciences).
Immunofluorescence
BS-C-1 cells were grown on cover slips to 80% confluency,
infected with recombinant VACV-WR strain vTF7-3
(ATCC VR-2153; MOI = 10), transfected with 200 ng
pDEST14 expression clone plasmid DNA per chamber
and incubated for approximately 16 h. After removing
growth medium, cells were washed once with RT Trisbuffered saline (TBS; 150 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM
NaCl), fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde (in
PBS), washed 5 min with TBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton ×-100 (in PBS) for 5 min at RT and then washed 3 × 5
min each with TBS. Cells were quenched in fresh 0.1%
sodium borohydride (in PBS) for 5 min, washed 3 × 5 min
with TBS, blocked (in 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% BSA,
0.02% NaN3, in PBS) for 1 h at RT with gentle agitation
and finally washed once for 5 min with TBS.

Cells were incubated in primary antibody diluted in 1%
BSA (in TBS) overnight at 4°C with gentle agitation,
washed 3 × 5 min with TBS and then incubated with secondary antibody diluted in 1% BSA (in TBS) at RT in the
dark for 45 min. Proteins containing a Myc tag were visualized using rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc primary antibody
(Cat # 2272, Cell Signalling Technology) 1:100 dilution,
and Alexa Fluor 568 conjugate goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L)
secondary antibody (Cat # A11011, Molecular Probes)
1:200 dilution. Proteins containing a HA tag were visualized using Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate mouse monoclonal
IgG1 anti-HA antibody (Cat # A21287, Molecular Probes)
1:200 dilution. Endogenous cellular tropomyosin was visualized using mouse monoclonal anti-tropomyosin IgG1
primary antibody (Cat # T2780, Sigma-Aldrich) 1:200
dilution, and goat anti-mouse IgG (whole molecule) FITC
conjugate secondary antibody (Cat # F2012, SigmaAldrich) 1:40 dilution. After incubation with secondary
antibody, cells were washed 3 × 5 min each with TBS in
low lighting, and DNA was visualized by incubation of
cells with DAPI (Cat # D5964, Sigma-Aldrich) at 1 ng/ml

in TBS for 5 min in the dark. Controls used herring sperm
DNA in place of the expression plasmids. After staining
with DAPI, cells were washed 3 × 5 min each with TBS in
low lighting and coverslips were mounted on slides using
the Prolong Antifade Kit (Cat # P7481, Molecular Probes).
Pictures of cells were taken at 1000× magnification using
the Leica DM6000 B microscope (Leica Microsystems,
Richmond Hill, ON, Canada) using the autoexposure
option.
