Abstract
Pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG), also known as securin is an important gene involved in
many biological functions including inhibition of sister chromatid separation, DNA repair, organ
development, and expression and secretion of angiogenic and metastatic factors. Proliferating
cancer cells and most tumors express high levels of PTTG. Overexpression of PTTG in vitro
induces cellular transformation and development of tumors in nude mice. The PTTG expression
levels have been correlated with tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis. Recent studies show
that down regulation of PTTG in tumor cell lines and tumors in vivo results in suppression of tumor
growth, suggesting its important role in tumorigenesis. In this review, we focus on PTTG structure,
sub-cellular distribution, cellular functions, and role in tumor progression with suggestions on
possible exploration of this gene for cancer therapy.

Introduction
Although death from ovarian cancer (OCA) ranks fifth in
prevalence, it is the most deadliest among gynecological
malignancies. Early diagnosis is essential for preventing
OCA fatalities. Treatment options for OCA typically
include surgery and chemotherapy. The goal of surgery is
to remove most of the cancerous growth. However,
depending on the stage of the cancer, some cancer cells
may remain following surgery. To eliminate these remaining cells, various adjuvant chemotherapy strategies are
employed based on cancer stage, tumor grade, and other
health concerns. While effective, chemotherapy treatments are accompanied by undesirable side effects rising
from the targeting of rapidly dividing cells, which is a hallmark trait of cancer cells. In this process, healthy cells that
also rapidly divide such as blood cells and cells lining the
mouth and GI tract are also damaged. To reduce such side
effects and increase cellular specificity, a targeted cancer
therapy for OCA is necessary that pinpoints etiological

characteristics other than high cellular metabolic rate. The
major drawback in understanding the etiology of OCA is
the availability of an appropriate OCA model. Many laboratories have initiated the development of OCA transgenic mice models. However, to date, there is no report of
having an efficient transgenic mouse model to study the
mechanism of ovarian tumorigenesis [1-6].
Pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG) is an oncogene
involved in cell cycle regulation and sister chromatid separation. PTTG is highly expressed in various tumors
including ovarian, suggesting that PTTG may function in
ovarian tumorigenesis. Initially, PTTG was cloned from
rat pituitary tumor and shown to induce cellular transformation in vitro and tumor development in nude mice [7].
The expression level of this gene was also found in germ,
Leyding, and sertoil cells in testis [8]. Subsequently, the
human homologue of PTTG was identified and shown to
be overexpressed in Jurkat T cells and leukocytes from

patients with myelodysplastic syndromes [9]. Zou et al.
[10] identified PTTG as the human securin, which is an
important protein for the inactivation of separases and
thereby keeps the sister chromatids intact until the onset
of anaphase. Extensive research on this gene was performed by many investigators in relation to its overexpression in several endocrine-related tumors including
pituitary, thyroid, breast, ovarian, and uterine as well as
non-endocrine-related cancers such as pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and those related to the central nervous system [11-19]. The availability of the molecular and
functional mechanisms of PTTG and its important role in
tumorigenesis in various cancers including OCA is of great
interest.
Structure and distribution
A. Gene structure and its homologues
Melmed and his colleagues originally isolated PTTG from
rat pituitary tumors ([7]. The rat PTTG gene is composed
of five exons and four, introns [8]. Zhang et al. [11] characterized the human homolog using rat PTTG cDNA as a
screening probe from a human fetal cDNA library. It was
shown to have 85% homology with the coding region of
rat PTTG. During the same time, we and two other groups
independently cloned and characterized human PTTG
[[9,12], and [20]]. Reported sequences from all the groups
were identical (GenBank accession numbers AJ223953,
AF075242, NM_004219, BC101834, AF095287, and
CR457135) except from Lee et al. [20], which was found
to be 95% identical (AF062649). The human PTTG gene
was found to be localized on chromosome 5 [5q35.1]
[21]. Mapping of the human PTTG gene revealed that it
contains five exons and four introns, which showed significant similarity to the rat PTTG gene [[8] and [22]].

Northern blot analysis of PTTG messenger (m)RNA
revealed that PTTG mRNA is 1.3 kb with an open reading
frame of 609 nucleotides encoding a protein of 203
amino acids (23 kDa). PTTG is a multidomain protein
consisting of a transactivation domain, a domain required
for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and a DNA-binding
domain [23]. Southern blot analysis of human genomic
DNA revealed the presence of two additional genes
homologous to human PTTG in the genome [24]. The
sequencing and restriction map analysis of the additional
genes showed significant homology with the PTTG gene.
Based on the similarity in the sequences, we renamed
PTTG as PTTG1 and the new genes as PTTG2 and PTTG3,
respectively. PTTG1 is 91% identical with PTTG2 and 89%
identical with PTTG3 at amino acid levels. PTTG2 expression was detected in liver tumors and normal liver tissues.
Both the genes were found to be intronless and present on
different chromosomes. The PTTG2 gene was localized on
chromosome 8 (8q13.1), whereas the PTTG3 gene was
present on chromosome 4 (4p15.1) [24]. The cluster anal-

ysis of these three PTTG homolog cDNA sequences is
shown in Figure 1. The Neighbor phylogenetic tree analyses of human PTTG homologues revealed that PTTG2 and
PTTG3 are more similar and formed a cluster leaving
PTTG1 separate (Fig. 2). The cDNA sequence of these
three homologues showed 85.25% identity to each other.
The PTTG2 and PTTG3 cDNA showed 86.56% identity,
whereas PTTG1 showed 88.85% identity with PTTG2 and
94.56% identity with PTTG3.
The cDNA sequences of PTTG from many species are now
available in the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. The cluster analysis of the
PTTG1 cDNA sequences from human, cow, gorilla, chimpanzee, rat, and cow showed that there is 61.5% identity
(consensus) in all of these species (Fig. 3). From the
Neighbor phylogenetic tree analysis, it was clear that the
PTTG1 cDNA from these species were clustered into two
major groups that were further divided into sub and subsub groups (Fig. 4). The first major group consists only of
human PTTG1, leaving the other species in a second
group. The second group is further divided into two subgroups in which gorilla and chimpanzee were together,
which left cow, rat, and mouse in the other group. In the
first sub-group, the gorilla and chimpanzee PTTG1 cDNA
sequences showed 98.85% identity. The PTTG1 cDNA
sequence of human and cow showed 88.34% identity, the
human, chimpanzee, and gorilla sequences showed 99%
identity, the human and rat sequences showed 78.65%
identity, and the human and mouse sequences showed
73.73% identity. The rat and mouse PTTG1 cDNA
sequences showed 81.67% identity and formed a cluster
together in the phylogenetic tree.
B. Cellular distribution
Although the role of PTTG1 as a transcriptional activator
for different genes and as an inhibitor of separase makes
its nuclear localization possible, a considerable amount of
PTTG1 protein is localized in cytoplasm, which is still
unclear. Although the hPTTG1 localizes both to the cytoplasm and to the nucleus [9,11,23,25-27], the ratio of
cytoplasmic-versus nuclear localization remains controversial. Dominguez et al. [9] showed that human PTTG1
is mainly present in the cytoplasm (85%) in Jurkat cells by
subcellular fractionation. Zhang et al. [11] and Seaz et al.
[25] showed the predominant expression of PTTG1 in
cytoplasm by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Stratford et al. [27] reported the
predominant localization of PTTG1 in cytoplasm in
HCT116 cells transfected with enhanced green fluorescent
protein (EGFP)-tagged PTTG1. On the other hand, Yu et
al. [26] demonstrated predominant nuclear localization
of PTTG1 during interphase in JEG-3 cells when transfected with wild type PTTG1, a FLAG epitope-tagged
PTTG1, or a PTTG1-EGFP construct. Interestingly, they

also reported the localization of PTTG1 in some cells
(<5%) to the plasma membrane. These investigators also
reported the nuclear localization of PTTG1-EGFP in other
cell lines like NIH3T3, rat GH3, mouse AtT20 pituitary
tumor, SKOV-3 human OCA, and COS-7 monkey kidney
cells. From their studies, these investigators reported the
co-localization of PTTG1-EGFP at different stages of mitosis by live imaging: co-localization with microtubule
asters in prophase and prometaphase in the form of granules during anaphase, which finally diminished in telophase. Mu et al. [28] showed that the sub-cellular

distribution of PTTG1 is cell type-dependent. These investigators showed nuclear localization of PTTG1 predominantly in HeLa, Cos-7, and DU145 cells, but diffuse
nuclear and cytoplasmic localization in A549, DLD-1, and
NIH3T3 cells.
Chien and Pei [23] showed that PTTG1 was associated
with PTTG1-binding factor (PBF). This association was
reported to be important for PTTG1 for its translocation to
the nucleus. These investigators also reported that the PBF
shares significant sequence homology with a previously

isolated cDNA, C21orf3 [29]. In their studies, Chien and
Pei [23] also reported that PTTG1 does not contain a consensus nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence, so it is
predominantly localized in cytoplasm by indirect
immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation studies. Furthermore, they showed that the co-expression of
both PBF and PTTG1 results in translocation of PTTG1
from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, suggesting that the
nuclear translocation of PTTG1 requires the presence of
the NLS of PBF. In the same study, the co-expression of a
PBF mutant that lacks its NLS was unable to bind to
PTTG1 and failed to promote PTTG nuclear accumulation.

PTTG in cell division
A. Cell cycle
Equal chromosome segregation during mitosis is maintained by the separation of sister chromatids in a controlled manner. The mechanism by which chromosomes
dissociate at anaphase has been solved elegantly both in
yeast and mammalian cells by Uhlmann et al. [30] and
Waizenegger et al. [31], respectively. The securin plays an
important role in maintaining sister chromatids together
until the onset of anaphase. The two sister chromatids are
held together by a multisubunit cohesion complex [32].
The Smc1p, Smc3p, and sister chromatid cohesion
(Scc)1p are members of the SMC family of putative
ATPase proteins that are associated with chromosomes to
exert a cohesive force that opposes microtubule-induced
chromosome splitting [32]. Scc1p binds to chromosomes
during S phase and dissociates at the onset of anaphase by
a protein called separin. The premature activation of separin is prevented by the binding of securin, which is activated by the degradation of securin by anaphasepromoting complex (APC) during anaphase [33]. The
APC, also called cyclosome [34], is an ubiquitin ligase
(E3) complex consisting of different subunits that ubiquitinate mitotic cyclins [34], securin [10,35-37], and other
cell cycle proteins [38,39]. The APC/C is activated by WD
repeat proteins in a cell cycle-specific manner and the activation pattern of the APC/C is remarkably conserved from
yeast to human. The APC/C is activated at metaphase and

persists until the G1 to S-phase transition [40,41]. The
APC/C is activated initially by fizzy (fzy), a Drosophila
homologue of p55CDC in rat and human, during the metaphase transition. Fzy is degraded later in mitosis (G1 and
G0) and is replaced by the fzy-related (fzr) proteins that
activate APC/C [42]. The fzy-mediated APC/C activity is
required for the degradation of securin during the onset of
anaphase, while fzr-mediated APC/C activity is essential
for the degradation of mitotic cyclins, fzy, and other substrates [38,39].
B. Chromosomal stability
Securin protein blocks chromosome segregation in both
budding and fission yeasts and in animal cells [10,35-37]
and is the key substrate of the APC pathway. Paradoxically, there is also evidence that securin has a positive role
in promoting sister chromatid separation. Funabiki et al.
[43] showed that in fission yeast, the loss of securin completely blocked chromosome segregation and the completion of mitosis and is therefore lethal. Stratmann and
Lehner [44] observed similar results in Drosophila pimples
mutants and pds1 mutants in S. cerevisiae, which showed
retarded anaphase entry [45].

The sister chromatid separation pathway, a downstream
target of the mitotic spindle checkpoint, is critically
important for preventing aneuploidy in the cells, which in
turn can lead to cancer [46,47]. To define the role of
securin in chromosomal stability, Jallepalli et al. [48]
inactivated both copies of the securin gene in the HCT116
human colorectal cancer cell line by using homologous
recombination. In their studies, they showed that securin
is required for chromosomal stability in humans, as
knockout cells exhibited a high rate of chromosome loss
similar to those observed in naturally occurring cancers.
Even after prolonged incubation in nocodazole or colcemid, no evidence for chromatid separation in securin(-/
-) cells was observed. In addition, they showed that the
deletion of securin blocked anaphase. This was similar to
the observations reported by Funabiki et al. [43] and Stratmann and Lehner [44] in budding yeast and Drosophila,
respectively. The time lapse experiments and immunofluorescence microscopy experiments showed that the
human cells lacking securin failed to have chromatid separation. This resulted in an abnormal anaphase completion thereby creating cells with budded nuclei,
chromosomal instability, and aneuploidy.
Wang et al. [49] reported that the securin in budding yeast
is phosphorylated by Chk1 kinase, which may increase its
stability and thereby block the cell cycle progression. Similar to Chk1, in mammalian cells, Ku-70, an enzyme
involved in DNA double-strand break repair, phosphorylates PTTG in vitro. The occurrence of genome damaging
events such as double-strand breakage can disrupt the

http://www.ovarianresearch.com/content/1/1/6

association of PTTG1 with Ku-70 [50]. These findings
were supported by Zhou et al. [51], who showed that
human cells treated with DNA-damaging drugs doxorubicin and bleomycin activated p53 and suppressed PTTG1
expressions. The DNA damage activates p53, which
induces cell cycle arrest for repair of the damaged DNA. In
the case of damages that are beyond repair, p53 promotes
programmed cell death. The functional mechanism of
p53 is mainly as a transcriptional regulator that induces or
inhibits expression of its target genes. The DNA damage
induced by doxorubicin and bleomycin activated p53 and
thereby suppressed expression of securin. Furthermore,
these investigators demonstrated that activation of p53
alone is sufficient to cause repression of securin by reducing the binding of the transcription factor NF-Y to its promoter.
PTTG in transcription
A. Binding elements
The expression of PTTG1 in normal tissues is restricted
and found to be highly expressed in the testis in a stagespecific manner during the spermatogenesis. These studies suggest that PTTG1 may play a role in male germ cell
differentiation [8,52]. Moreover, the expression levels of
PTTG1 increased during cell proliferation and in mitosis
in a cell cycle-dependent manner, which indicates its role
in regulation of the cell cycle [53]. Although the expression levels of PTTG1 are restricted in normal cells, elevated expressions of PTTG1 were observed in many
tumors including carcinomas of the lung, breast, colon,
and ovary, leukemia and lymphoma, and also in pituitary
adenomas [6,9,11,13,15,18,25]. Overexpression of
PTTG1 in cancer cells supports the argument that PTTG1
is actively involved in cell proliferation as the cancer cell
has the highest cell proliferation capacity. It is recognized
that the C-terminal region of PTTG1 possesses transcriptional activity [9]. In their experiment with COS-7 cells,
Chien and Pei [23] showed that when these cells were
transiently transfected with fibroblast growth factor-2
(bFGF) promoter driven by luciferase along with the
PTTG1 expression plasmid, the transactivation of the luciferase gene was observed (nearly 1.5-fold). On transfection of these cells, their binding partner PBF, and the
PTTG1 expression vector, the transactivation of the luciferase gene was increased by 3-fold. The expression of PBF
alone did not increase the reporter activity. Even though
these experiments did not show direct evidence that the
PTTG1 protein binds to the bFGF promoter, the reporter
gene assay showed that there is a direct or indirect role of
PTTG1 protein and PBF on bFGF transcriptional regulation.

Pei [54] identified the downstream targets of the PTTG1
protein. The total RNA of HeLaS3 cells expressing PTTG1
were hybridized with human cDNA expression array fil-

ters having 84 known transcripts. It was found that five
gene transcripts (c-myc oncogene, MEK1, MEK3, protein
kinase CÎ²-1, PKCÎ²-1) and the heat shock protein (HSP)
70 were elevated by PTTG1 overexpression. Due to the
oncogenic function of c-myc, Pei also examined the
increased cell proliferation and colony formation by the
induction of c-myc expression by PTTG1. Dominguez et
al. [9] showed that the C-terminal portion of PTTG1 contains a transcriptional activation domain, but the direct
evidence of its transactivation function by DNA-binding
studies was not shown. In her experiments, Pei [54] used
a c-myc promoter to characterize the PTTG1 interaction
with DNA. She showed that PTTG1 protein binds to the cmyc promoter near the transcription start site and forms a
complex with the ubiquitous transcription activator
upstream stimulating factor 1 (USF1). Mapping of PTTG1
protein showed the region between amino acids 60 and
118 as the PTTG-DNA binding domain. Later on, Stratford et al. [27] identified PBF expression in thyroid
tumors and demonstrated that PBF had a transforming
ability in vitro and a tumorigenic ability in vivo. The PTTG1
and PBF expressions were upregulated in thyroid cancer
[27,55,56] and were reported to stimulate bFGF expression [11]. Taking this into account as well as the PTTG1
role in repressing iodide uptake in vivo [56], Boelaert et al.
[55] studied the role of PTTG1 and PBF in the repression
of sodium iodide symporter (NIS) expression and function in thyroid tumors. From their in vitro experiments, it
was observed that the PTTG1 and PBF inhibit NIS mRNA
expression and iodide uptake. In their detailed studies on
the NIS promoter in rat FRTL-5 cells, they transfected
pGL3-luc promoter constructs, which contain either 544
base pairs (bps) of the proximal NIS promoter, the human
NIS upstream enhancer element (hNUE), or a fusion of
both (hNUE-basal NIS) co-transfected with PTTG1 or
PBF. From these experiments, they observed no significant
reduction in reporter activity when transfected with NIS
basal promoter with PTTG1, but did observe a significant
reduction in reporter expressions when transfected with
PTTG1 and hNUE as well as its fusion with NIS. In contrast, PBF could significantly suppress the promoter activity with the NIS basal promoter, hNUE, and also the
fusion promoter of both NIS-hNUE. They also showed
that within this â1 kb element, the USF1 response element is critical to PTTG1 whereas PBF requires the USF1/
PAX8 complex for repression of NIS.
B. Interacting proteins and the pathways
To understand the role of human PTTG1 in sister chromatid separation and tumorigenesis, Romero et al. [50] utilized a yeast two-hybrid approach to identify the proteins
that interact with PTTG1. In their experiment, they isolated a protein of 70 kDa, Ku-70, which specifically interacts with PTTG1. The Ku-70 protein interacts with Ku-80,
which together forms the DNA-dependent protein kinase

http://www.ovarianresearch.com/content/1/1/6

(DNA-PK) [57]. This enzyme is involved in DNA doublestrand breakage repair caused by certain chemical and
genetic reactions including some chemotherapeutic
drugs. Romero et al. [50] showed that the Ku dimer interacts with the N-terminal portion of human PTTG1. In
their experiments, they also demonstrated that DNA double-strand breakage prevents PTTG-Ku-70 interaction by
activation of DNA-PK complexes. The DNA-PK complex
phosphorylates PTTG1, which blocks the sister chromatid
separation. These findings support the role of human
PTTG1 in tumorigenesis by causing aneuploidy through
DNA damage-response pathways.
High levels of PTTG1 expression have been reported in a
variety of tumors. It is also known that insulin-like growth
factor-I (IGF-I) and insulin induce many oncogenes [58].
Chamaon et al. [17] tested the influence of IGF-I and insulin on PTTG1 expression in human astrocytoma cells in
comparison to proliferating non-neoplastic rat embryonal
astrocytes. PTTG1 mRNA expression and protein levels
were increased in malignant astrocytes when treated with
IGF-I or insulin, whereas in rat embryonic astrocytes,
PTTG1 expression and protein levels increased only when
cells were exposed to IGF-I. In their experiments, they
showed that the IGF-I/insulin-pathways regulate PTTG1
transcription. In our experiments using the breast tumor
cell line MCF-7, we showed that insulin and IGF-1 regulate the expression of PTTG1 primarily through the activation of phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT cascade
[59]. Heaney et al. [60] showed a 2.4-fold induction of
PTTG1 mRNA in NIH-3T3 cells when treated with bFGF.
In addition to these findings, Tfelt-Hansen et al. [61]
showed that the stimulation of the U87MG cell line with
EGF and TGFÎ± upregulated PTTG1 expression. Voltides et
al. [62] showed that PTTG1 is a target for EGFR-mediated
paracrine regulation of pituitary cell growth. We also
showed the suppression of bFGF in H1299 tumors when
treated with PTTG1 small interfering (si)RNA compared
to untreated and control-treated siRNA in nude mice [18].
Taken together, it was suggested that PTTG1 regulates
and/or is regulated by many different growth factors such
as IGF-I, EGF, TGFÎ±, and bFGF, which are involved in
pathways such as PI3K, mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK), and angiogenesis.
During our recent investigations to understand the mechanisms by which PTTG1 is involved in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, we performed transient and stable
transfections of HEK293 cells with PTTG1 cDNA and
studied the expression and secretion of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 [18]. The zymography, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR), ELISA, and
MMP-2 gene promoter activity assays showed significantly increased MMP-2 secretion and expression. We also
showed a significant increase in cell migration, invasion,

and tubule formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) when treated with the conditioned
medium collected from the HEK293 cells overexpressing
PTTG1. Based on these experiments, we suggest that
PTTG1 is actively involved in tumor angiogenesis and
metastasis via activation of proteolysis and increases in
invasion occur through modulation of MMP-2 activity
and its expression. Blocking or down regulation of PTTG1
in tumors may result in suppression of tumor growth and
metastasis through the related down regulation of MMP2 expression and activity.
PTTG in cancer
A. Tumor initiation and cell proliferation
Since PTTG1 was isolated and characterized, there have
been nearly 100 articles published on the role of PTTG1 in
various cancers. Many investigators have focused on determining the mechanisms and pathways by which PTTG1
induces its tumorigenic function. Pei and Melmed [7]
showed that overexpression of PTTG1 in mouse NIH3T3
fibroblasts inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell
transformation in vitro. Injection of PTTG1 transfected
NIH3T3 cells into athymic nude mice resulted in tumor
formation within 3 weeks in all these animals. From their
results, they suggested that this gene might play a role in
pituitary tumorigenesis. Dominguez et al. [9] cloned a
human cDNA homologue of PTTG1 (hpttg). They
reported that the expression of hpttg in samples obtained
from normal donors was very low or undetectable,
whereas it was found to be overexpressed in Jurkat cells as
well as in leukocytes from patients with different kinds of
hematopoietic neoplasms or myelodysplastic syndromes.
Zhang et al. [11] investigated the expression levels of
PTTG1 in many normal and cancerous cells and found
that PTTG1 is expressed in normal adult testis, thymus,
colon, small intestine, brain, lung, and fetal liver. We also
observed the overexpression of PTTG1 in tissues of ovarian cancer from different patients (Figure. 5). It is
expressed most abundantly in several carcinoma cell lines
including cervix carcinoma HeLa cell, choriocarcinomas
JEG-3 and JAR, breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7, osteogenic
sarcoma U-2OS, hepatocellular carcinoma Hep 3B, lung
carcinoma EY, ovarian CAOV3 and thyroid carcinoma TC1. Saez et al. [25] also isolated and characterized hpttg
from human thymus and studied the expression of hpttg
in human pituitary adenomas. In their studies, they found
that the hpttg is highly expressed in the majority of pituitary adenomas while only very low levels were detected in
normal pituitary glands.

Later, the overexpression of this gene was reported in
many other tumors including esophageal cancer [63], thyroid cancer [55], small cell lung cancer and non-small cell
lung cancer [18,64,65], testicular cancer [15,66], OCA
[6,15,67], breast cancer [14,59], uterine leiomyomas [16],

liver cancer [68], and colorectal cancer [69]. Kakar and
Jennes [12] and Hamid et al. [70] showed that overexpression of PTTG in NIH3T3 as well as the human embryonic
kidney cell line HEK 293 resulted in increased cell proliferation, induction of cellular transformation, and development of tumors in nude mice, suggesting an oncogenic
function of PTTG in human tumorigenesis.
B. Angiogenesis
Soon after the isolation and characterization of PTTG1 in
humans, Heaney et al. [60] reported that PTTG1 is regulated in vivo and in vitro by estrogen and that its induction
levels coincide with bFGF and vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF). The bFGF and other growth factors
are known to modulate angiogenesis in many tissues; regulation of expression of these factors by PTTG1 suggests a
role of PTTG1 in angiogenesis. Ishikawa et al. [71] showed
that the conditioned medium collected from the NIH3T3
cells transfected with wild type human PTTG1 induced
angiogenesis. They also observed that the bFGF concentration in PTTG1 conditioned medium was elevated compared to the conditioned medium from untransfected
NIH3T3 cells. From their experiments, they concluded
that the human PTTG1 induces an angiogenic phenotype
via bFGF both in vitro and in vivo. Kim et al. [72] investigated the role of PTTG1 in regulating angiogenic factors in
addition to VEGF and bFGF in thyroid cancer. As specified
above, the PTTG1 has been shown to up-regulate VEGF
expression. It has also been reported that VEGF may upregulate an angiogenic gene known as an inhibitor of
DNA binding-3 (ID3) expression [73], which is believed
to play a critical role in cell proliferation and to be a precursor of endothelial cell recruitment [74,75]. As the ID3
is differentially expressed in thyroid cells, which also
express high PTTG1 levels, an interaction between PTTG1,
VEGF, and ID3 is suggested. Recently, Kim et al. [72] demonstrated the suppression of the angiogenic inhibitor
thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) by PTTG. They also showed
regulation of expression of ID3 by PTTG in primary
human thyroid cells. The mechanisms by which PTTG1
regulates expression of TSP-1 and ID3 are not clear. However, these investigators suggest that the mechanisms by
which PTTG1 regulates TSP-1 and ID3 expression may be
direct or indirect, but it remains unclear along which pathway PTTG1 exerts this effect. Furthermore, these investigators showed that the effects of PTTG1 on ID3 expression
were significantly reduced when they used the SH3
domain mutant of PTTG1, suggesting an important role
for the SH3 domain in regulating ID3 expression. The
SH3-binding domain of PTTG1 has been shown to be
involved in up-regulation of both VEGF and FGF-2
[76,77]. The C-terminal portion of PTTG1 contains a
DNA-binding domain that is shown to be involved
directly in stimulating the c-myc promoter [54], suggesting

http://www.ovarianresearch.com/content/1/1/6

that a direct interaction of PTTG1 with the ID3 gene may
contribute in part to PTTG1's regulatory effect.
In addition to ID3, Kim et al. [72] also showed that the
angiogenic inhibitor TSP-1 is decreased by 2.5-fold in
response to PTTG1 overexpression in vitro. Suppression of
PTTG1 with siRNA a 2-fold induction of TSP-1 was
observed. From these observations, these investigators
concluded that PTTG1 may promote tumor angiogenesis
by regulating the expression of angiogenic genes such as
VEGF, bFGF, ID3, and TSP-1, suggesting that PTTG1 may
be a key gene in thyroid tumorigenesis. Although the
complete mechanism of PTTG1 in angiogenesis is not
known, it appears that PTTG1 is an important gene in regulating several angiogenic genes by multiple pathways.
Therefore, detailed studies on PTTG1 in angiogenesis are
essential for developing a stage-specific as well as a targeted cancer therapy.
C. Metastasis
As described above, PTTG1 plays an important role in
angiogenesis and there are many reports on its involvement in metastasis. Shibata et al. [63] examined PTTG1
expression levels in esophageal cancer. They observed significantly higher PTTG1 mRNA levels in tumor tissues
compared to the corresponding normal tissues. They further showed a correlation between expression and levels
of pain and with pathological stage and extensive lymph
node metastasis. These investigators also observed the
median survival time (8.5 months) for patients with high
PTTG1 expression levels compared to the survival time
(14.0 months) for patients with low PTTG1 expression
levels, suggesting a role of PTTG1 in metastasis. Solbach et
al. [14] analyzed 72 tumor samples derived from primary
tumors of patients suffering from breast cancer and unaffected breast epithelium for PTTG1 mRNA expression levels and to determine a relationship with pathological
parameters over a 5-year observation period. From their
analyses, these investigators found a direct correlation
between PTTG1 mRNA overexpression and lymph node
infiltration. The overexpression of PTTG1 in tumors correlated with a higher degree of tumor recurrence and tumor
aggression. They also obtained similar results with primary tumors of 89 patients suffering from squamous cell
carcinoma [78]. Consistent with these observations, Ramaswamy et al. [79] reported a correlation between expression levels of PTTG1 with metastatic adenocarcinomas
using microarray analysis.

To understand the mechanism of PTTG1 in angiogenesis
and metastasis, Malik and Kakar [80] studied the regulation of MMPs by PTTG1. MMPs are the proteolytic
enzymes required for tumor cells to invade and metastasize. MMPs are known to play a key role in degradation of
the basement membrane and extracellular matrix. Among

Page 10 of 19

Journal of Ovarian Research 2008, 1:6

these, MMP-2 and MMP-9 cleave the type IV collagen and
gelatin, which are the principal structural components of
the basement membrane [81]. Since PTTG1 has been
reported to have a role in angiogenesis and metastasis
[19,55,79], we hypothesize that the regulation of MMP-2
by PTTG1 is one of the mechanisms by which PTTG1 contributes to angiogenesis and metastasis.
D. Apoptosis
PTTG1 has been shown to regulate the expression of p53,
a tumor suppressor gene that subjects to apoptosis by
inducing apoptosis-inducing genes. Yu et al. [26] hypothesized the role of PTTG1 in apoptosis. In their studies,
they examined p53 involvement in PTTG1-induced cell
death in cells expressing or lacking wild type p53. In their
experiments, these investigators showed that in MCF-7
breast cancer cells expressing wild type p53, PTTG1 overexpression caused apoptosis. They observed translocation
of p53 to the nuclei in cells that overexpressed PTTG1. In
their experiments, they also observed that the dominant
negative p53 mutant did not inhibit PTTG1-induced
apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. From these observations, they
concluded the mutant p53 may not completely inhibit
endogenous p53 activity and that mechanisms other than
p53 may also be involved in PTTG1-induced apoptosis.
They also observed apoptosis by PTTG1 in p53-negative
MG-63 cells. The transient or stable expressions of PTTG1
in these cells were found to increase the frequency of aneuploidy. Based on these experiments, these investigators
concluded that aneuploidy was not the cause of apoptosis
in these PTTG1 overexpressing cells since the majority of
cells were not aneuploid before they entered apoptosis.
They suggested that PTTG1 has a duel role in inducing
p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis as well as
aneuploidy. In the cells where both of the apoptotic pathways fail, PTTG1 induces these cells to undergo aneuploidy, which eventually results in cancer.

The overexpression of p21WAF1/CIP1 was shown to cause
both G1/S and G2/M arrest and can effectively suppress
tumor growth [82,83]. The p21WAF1/CIP1 is a cyclin kinase
inhibitor that can induce cell growth arrest by inactivating
cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) or by inhibiting the activity of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The
serum and various growth factors such as PDGF, FGF,
EGF, and TGF-Î² can induce p21WAF1/CIP1 expression [8486]. Mu et al. [28] investigated the role of PTTG1 in
p21WAF1/CIP1-induced apoptosis in the A549 lung cancer
cell line. In their studies, they overexpressed PTTG1 in
HeLa and A549 cells and showed inhibition of cell proliferation, colony formation, and thymidine incorporation.
They observed no change in the levels of expression of
p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 in PTTG1 overexpressed HeLa cells,
whereas the p21WAF1/CIP1 was overexpressed by PTTG1 in
A549 cells. No significant change in p53 expressions was

http://www.ovarianresearch.com/content/1/1/6

observed in either cell line transfected with PTTG1. These
investigators also studied the effect of PTTG1 on p21WAF1/
CIP1 expression by the luciferase assay. They showed activation of the lucifierase gene driven by p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter by PTTG1 cDNA, suggesting that the
overexpression of PTTG1 in A549 caused p21WAF1/CIP1mediated apoptosis, which is an event independent of
p53-mediated apoptosis. However, the p21WAF1/CIP1
expression levels did not increase significantly in HeLa
cells overexpressed with PTTG1, suggesting that PTTG1
can mediate apoptosis both by p21WAF1/CIP1-dependent
and independent pathways.
Mouse models
A. Transgenic mouse model
To understand the role of PTTG1 in tumorigenesis, Abbud
et al. [87] developed transgenic mice expressing PTTG1
under the control of mouse Î±GSU promoter. These transgenic mice showed PTTG1 expression in LH- and GH-producing cells ranging from hyperplasia to development of
frank adenoma. The expression of PTTG1 in GH cell
hyperplasia was surprising because the Î±GSU promoter
has not been shown to express in mature somatotropes. In
addition, transgenic mice showed prostate and seminal
vesicle neoplasia due to increased GH and LH that
resulted in elevated IGF-I and testosterone levels. In
males, they observed bladder obstruction, kidney reflex,
and inflammation due to prostate hyperplasia. The transgenic male mice also showed multiple reproductive
defects similar to transgenic mice that overexpress human
chorionic gonadotropin [88,89], suggesting its role in LH
overexpression leading to prostate hyperplasia. This also
suggests that PTTG1 overexpression in transgenic mice
affects early pituitary multipotential cells or may influence neighboring non-Î±GSU-expressing cells by some
unknown paracrine mechanism.

The oncogenic function of PTTG1 was further confirmed
by crossbreeding of retinoblastoma (Rb; +/-) animals with
transgenic animals [90]. Rb is an important tumor suppressor gene, one that is phosphorylated by G1 cyclin/
Cdk complexes. The mice bearing a single Rb mutant
allele developed pituitary tumors with almost complete
penetrance [91-93]. Chesnokova et al. [90] observed high
levels of pituitary PTTG1 mRNA and protein in pretumorous Rb- mice. Crossbreeding of Rb (+/-) animals with
PTTG1 transgenic animals showed enlarged pituitary
glands and a 3.5-fold increase in the frequency of tumors
originating fromÎ±-subunit-expressing cells. They also
observed that bitransgenic animals with enlarged pituitary glands developed pituitary tumors earlier compared
to Rb (+/-) animals. Confocal microscopic experiments
revealed an alteration in the chromatin pattern similar to
malignant cells. Increases in pituitary hyperplasia in
PTTG1 overexpressing cells were observed in these

bitransgenic mice when compared to Rb+/- mice, supporting a role of PTTG1 in pituitary gland tumorigenesis. In
their studies, these investigators found an absence of the
antiapoptotic marker bcl-2 in these animals, suggesting
that there might be a different mechanism other than
inhibition of the apoptotic pathway.
Almost 90% of OCAs are derived from the ovarian surface
epithelium (OSE). However, the biology of epithelial cancer initiation remains unknown. As reported above,
PTTG1 is found to be overexpressed in most of the ovarian
tumors analyzed to date and the PTTG1 promoter is specifically activated in tumor cells, including OSE tumor
cells. To evaluate the oncogenic function of PTTG1 and its
ability to transform OSE cells, we generated transgenic
animals that express PTTG1 in OSE cells under the control
of the MISIIR gene promoter [6]. We generated an F1 population by breeding the male F0 founders with wild type
females. Analysis of the male transgenic animals revealed
urinary tract obstruction secondary to prostate hyperplasia (enlarged prostate) at 8 to 10 months of age. The urinary bladder was enlarged with wall thickening, increased
in visualization, and filled with urine containing white
deposits [6]. The seminal vesicles and epididymis in some
of the transgenic males were enlarged. Preliminary observation of the seminal vesicles showed signs of hyperplasia
or adenoma.
Analysis of female transgenic mice showed expression of
transgene in OSE cells. The transgenic females (8 to 10
months old) had enlarged and abnormal ovaries (Fig. 6).
Instead of developing oocytes in various cycles, they all
seem to be at the corpora luteal stage. In addition, the ovaries appeared to be enlarged with an increased number of
corpora luteum. Only rare primary follicles were noted
compared to age-matched, non-transgenic mice, in which
the ovaries showed follicles at various stages of development. The fallopian tube glandular structure demonstrated less complexicity compared to normal and the
fallopian tubes of the transgenic mice no longer showed
vasculation (Fig. 7). The endometrium of transgenic mice
showed various abnormalities including cystic dilation of
the uterine cavity as well as increased complexicity of the
endometrial glands with increased secretion as compared
to non-transgenic mice. There appeared to be no evidence
of a previous cycle, such as scaring, hemosiderin-laden
macrophages, or stromal histocytes. The increase in the
number of corpora luteum in transgenic mice could be
due to increases in LH leading to increases in ovulation.
Measurement of serum LH and testosterone using the EIA
kit showed a significant change in the levels of LH and testosterone (Fig. 8) in two lines compared to wild-type animals, whereas no change in FSH levels were observed.
Estrogen levels showed a 1.3-fold increase, but progester-

http://www.ovarianresearch.com/content/1/1/6

one levels remained unchanged (data not shown).
Although there appeared to be early signs of hyperplasia
and neoplasia, however, none of the animals developed
visible ovarian or endometrial tumors within 8- to 10months of age, suggesting that PTTG1 overexpression is
not sufficient to induce tumorigenesis in mice and
requires a hormonal trigger or cooperation of other
gene(s), such as the inactivation of p53, to initiate tumorigenesis in OSE cells.
B. Knockout mice
To further demonstrate the importance of PTTG1 in tumorigenesis and other biological functions, Wang et al. [94]
developed mice lacking the murine PTTG1 gene by
homologous recombination. They observed PTTG1 -/mice for up to 8 months and found that these animals
were viable and fertile in contrast to the phenotypes
observed in yeast or Drosophila securin. As securin is
involved in inhibition of sister chromatid separation, it
was expected that PTTG1-null mice may not survive.
However, the non-fatal phenotype of these knock out
mice suggests that there might be more than one mechanism for sister chromatid separation. Thus, it is likely that
the other mechanisms compensated for the loss of securin
and its function in the cell cycle. The mice lacking PTTG1
were found to have testicular and splenic hypoplasia,
thymic hyperplasia, and thrombocytopenia. From these
results, the investigators suggested that the PTTG1 disruption caused cell cycle and chromosomal changes in
PTTG1-abundant tissues in a tissue-specific manner and
that PTTG1 is involved in spermatogenesis and platelet
formation. In their subsequent studies, Wang et al. [95]
showed that the reduction of pancreatic islet mass and the
decrease in Î² cell numbers in PTTG1 knockout male mice
resulted in diabetes type I in their late adulthood. Though
the IGF-1 and thyroid hormone levels were normal in
these mice, some additional non-genetic factors may have
contributed to hyperglycemia development in these mice
in addition to PTTG loss. In contrast, PTTG -/- female mice
exhibited normal plasma glucose levels, suggesting that
estrogen might be protective for islet maintenance and in
Î² cell proliferation. To define the role of PTTG1 in
tumorogenesis, Chesnokova et al. [90] crossbred PTTG1null transgenic mice with Rb (+/-) mice. They showed that
by crossbreeding Rb (+/-) mice with knockout mice, the
development of pituitary tumors could be delayed. In
their experiments, they suggested that the absence of
PTTG1 may allow expression of p21, which causes cell
cycle arrest. These results support the findings of Abbud et
al. [87], who showed that overexpression of pituitary
PTTG1 in Rb (+/-) animals influenced tumor initiation
and progression by enhancing cell proliferation.

A target for cancer therapy
A. PTTG siRNA
As described above, PTTG1 has an important role in the
cell cycle and tumorigenesis through different pathways.
In this section, we describe the possibilities of exploring
PTTG1 for targeted cancer therapy. Various researchers
have found an abnormally high expression of PTTG1 in a
wide range of human primary tumors such as those found
in the ovary, testis, kidney, colon, thyroid, pituitary, liver,
adrenal, and breast as well as in a range of tumor cell lines
such as melanoma, leukemia, and lymphoma
[9,12,15,19,25,53,55,63,79,96-98]. These findings indicate that PTTG1 may be involved in tumorigenesis in
humans. Further supporting this idea, high expression levels of PTTG1 have a positive correlation with increased
tumor invasiveness in human pituitary tumors [98] and
degree of malignancy, pathogenesis, and progression of
colorectal, thyroid, and breast tumors [19,55,97]. PTTG1
has been identified as one of eight signature genes upregulated in human primary tumors that are associated with
tumor metastasis [79].

Much has been investigated and is known about the
upregulation of PTTG1, downregulation of PTTG of keen
interest at this point. Kakar and Malik [18] used interference RNA (RNAi) directed against PTTG1 to study this
effect. In this technique, siRNA is introduced into cells to
silence the expression of a gene. The siRNA is a 19-nucleotide long, double-stranded RNA that enters the cell and
degrades the mRNA of the target gene [99]. We [18] transfected H1299 cells with PTTG1 siRNA duplex and found
that PTTG1 mRNA was almost completely depleted
within a day or two in comparison to untransfected or
control cells. We also found that there was almost a 60%
reduction in PTTG1 protein after two days of transfection.
When H1299 cells transfected with PTTG1 siRNA duplex
were plated on soft agar, colony formation was significantly reduced compared to untransfected or control cells.
Mice injected with H1299 cells transfected with PTTG1
siRNA followed by intratumoral injection of PTTG1
siRNA, mice developed no tumors after two weeks and
small tumors after four weeks compared to large tumors
that developed in mice injected with untransfected or con-

trol siRNA transfected cells. PTTG1 siRNA was successful
in downregulating PTTG1 as well as Ki67, bFGF, and
CD34 in H1299 tumors in nude mice. These results indicate that downregulation of PTTG1 using PTTG1 siRNA
inhibits tumors grown in vitro and in vivo.
In another study, El-Naggar et al. [100] used specific
siRNA to down regulate PTTG1 expression. These investigators silenced PTTG1 expression in human A2780 OCA
cells and investigated the effect on tumor formation in
vitro and in vivo. The mRNA and protein of PTTG1 expression was significantly reduced by treatment with siRNA.
Stable cell lines expressing PTTG1 siRNA showed a 50%
reduction in cell proliferation compared to vector or control transfected cells and colony formation was reduced by
70% in soft agar. Nude mice injected with A2780 cells
expressing PTTG1-siRNA showed a decrease in tumor
development and growth [100].
B. PTTG Adenovirus siRNA
Adenoviruses were originally identified and characterized
as pathogens that cause common colds, gastroenteritis,
conjunctivitis, cystitis, or respiratory illnesses. Later, these
adenoviruses were explored in the investigation of mammalian molecular and cell biology experiments as well as
for becoming an efficient vector for gene therapy [101].
Although there are many other viral vectors such as retroviruses, adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), lentiviruses
(LVs), and herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) used for cancer
and other gene therapies, the high infectivity of most
mammalian cell types, high expression level of the transgene, ease for achieving high virus titer and replication
deficiency, large capacity for accommodating transgene(s), and non-integration into the mammalian

genome have made adenovirus one of the most widely
used gene transfer vectors [102]. The replication-defective
adenovirus has been commonly used as a vector for cancer
gene therapy to transfer tumor-suppressor genes, anti-angiogenic factors, prodrug-activating genes, and immunostimulatory genes [102-104]. Recently, Cho-Rok et al. [68]
utilized the adenovirus vector system to deliver PTTG1
siRNA and showed the inhibition of liver cancer cell
growth both in vitro and in vivo. In their experiment, they
showed that PTTG1 serves as a negative regulator of p53
tumor suppression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
and that depletion of PTTG1 significantly inhibits growth
of PTTG1-overexpressing HCC cell lines in vitro and in
vivo. From these experiments, it is evident that the adenovirus-mediated PTTG1-siRNA appears to selectively target
tumor cells expressing high levels of PTTG1 with functional p53, which may serve as a valuable gene therapy
approach for treating human cancers including ovarian
cancer. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest
that down regulation of PTTG1 in cancer results in suppression of tumor growth and progression. Therefore,
down-regulation of PTTG1 or inactivation of its tumorgenic function in cancer may become an important target
in developing new cancer therapies.

Conclusion
PTTG is an oncogene with multiple domains and multiple
functions. It is transcriptionally regulated by various
growth factors and is highly expressed in most of the
tumors and tumor cell lines analyzed to date. Up regulation of PTTG increases cell proliferation, induces cellular
transformation and promotes tumor development in
nude mice. On the other hand down regulation of PTTG
in cancer results in suppression of tumor growth and ang-

target gene for the treatment of cancer. The molecular
mechanism by which PTTG mediates its tumorigenic
function is still unclear. The possible mechanism and
pathways by which PTTG induces its tumorigenic functions are summarized in Fig. 9.
