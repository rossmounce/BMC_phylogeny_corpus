Abstract
Background: Histone variants alter the composition of nucleosomes and play crucial roles in transcription,
chromosome segregation, DNA repair, and sperm compaction. Modification of metazoan histone variant lineages
occurs on a background of genome architecture that shows global similarities from sponges to vertebrates, but
the urochordate, Oikopleura dioica, a member of the sister group to vertebrates, exhibits profound modification of
this ancestral architecture.
Results: We show that a histone complement of 47 gene loci encodes 31 histone variants, grouped in distinct sets
of developmental expression profiles throughout the life cycle. A particularly diverse array of 15 male-specific
histone variants was uncovered, including a testes-specific H4t, the first metazoan H4 sequence variant reported.
Universal histone variants H3.3, CenH3, and H2A.Z are present but O. dioica lacks homologs of macroH2A and
H2AX. The genome encodes many H2A and H2B variants and the repertoire of H2A.Z isoforms is expanded
through alternative splicing, incrementally regulating the number of acetylatable lysine residues in the functionally
important N-terminal “charge patch”. Mass spectrometry identified 40 acetylation, methylation and ubiquitylation
posttranslational modifications (PTMs) and showed that hallmark PTMs of “active” and “repressive” chromatin were
present in O. dioica. No obvious reduction in silent heterochromatic marks was observed despite high gene density
in this extraordinarily compacted chordate genome.
Conclusions: These results show that histone gene complements and their organization differ considerably even
over modest phylogenetic distances. Substantial innovation among all core and linker histone variants has evolved
in concert with adaptation of specific life history traits in this rapidly evolving chordate lineage.

Background
In eukaryotes, chromatin is the interface through which
genetically encoded information is read to orchestrate a
diversity of cellular and organismal functions. Chromosomal packaging of nuclear DNA is achieved through small
basic histone proteins. The highly conserved core histones,
H4, H3, H2A and H2B form an octamer of two H2A/H2B
dimers flanking a central H3/H4 tetramer that wrap ~147
bp of DNA in 1.7 turns to form the nucleosome core
particle (NCP) [1]. Tetramer formation is common to
archaeal and eukaryotic histones. The eukaryotic origin of

H2A-H2B dimers, doubling the DNA wrap capacity, has
been discussed in light of demands of increased genome
size [2] and kinetic constraints of DNA compaction
imposed by eukaryotic mitosis [3]. Interactions between
the histone octamer and DNA are further modulated by
linker histones H1/H5, which associate with DNA at its
entry/exit site on the NCP surface [4]. Roles of histones in
structural compaction must be balanced with regulatory
mechanisms that permit selective access to DNA to enable
functions such as transcription, replication and DNA
repair. Three major strategies contribute to regulatory
remodeling of chromatin: ATP-dependent complexes that
act on nucleosomes to modify accessibility of wrapped
DNA sequences to trans-acting factors [5], the deployment

of histone variants that alter nucleosome dynamics, and
covalent posttranslational histone modifications (PTMs)
including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, citrullination, ADP-ribosylation, glycoslylation
and sumoylation [6,7]. One current view is that eukaryotic
genomes are indexed locally, and over broader regions,
through a combination of histone variants and their
diverse PTMs [8,9].
Main lineages of canonical core histones, constituting
the bulk of histone proteins, are assembled into chromatin during DNA replication. These replication dependent
(RD) genes lack introns, are typically organized in gene
clusters and their mRNAs possess a conserved stem-loop
(SL) in the 3’UTR coupling gene expression to DNA
replication. In contrast, histone variants are often transcribed from orphan genes that contain introns, lack the
SL and their expression is not restricted to S-phase. Consequently, they are referred to as replacement or replication-independent (RI) variants. From an evolutionary
perspective, histone variants are classified as universal or
lineage-specific variants, where the term variant refers to
non-allelic sequence variation. Universal variants have
ancient functions common to eukaryotic cells, whereas
lineage-specific variants appear specialized to certain
organismal requirements. Core histones clearly differ in
their evolutionary propensity to diversify as distinct variants. H4 is highly constrained as it makes contacts with
the other 3 core histones and its N-terminal tail residues
are subject to extensive PTMs. This is reflected in its
nearly invariant stature. No H4 amino acid sequence variants have been reported in any multicellular organism to
date and diversified H4s are known only in trypanosomes
and ciliates [10,11]. Despite H2Bs showing substantially
less evolutionary sequence constraint than H3 and H4
they, like H4, exhibit little specialization [12], with the
exception of gametogenesis variants. On the other hand,
H3 and H2A are much richer in their genealogy with
diversification of a number of functionally essential
variants.
The two H3 molecules interact with each other in the
nucleosome, as do the two H2A molecules, whereas H4
and H2B do not. Two-fold nucleosomal symmetry is organized along the C-terminal four-helix bundle dimerization
interface of the two H3s [1]. Interaction between the two
H2As is mediated by their loop 1 (L1) domains. Specializations have evolved in the H3 lineage with at least two H3
variants present in most eukaryotes. The replacement
variant H3.3 can undergo RD or RI assembly and deposition is primarily in transcribed regions of euchromatin
[13,14]. H3.3 differs from canonical H3 at few positions,
predominantly, one in the N-terminal tail and three in the
a2 helix of the histone fold domain (HFD), the latter three
required for RI assembly [13]. All eukaryotes possess H3.3
though Asomycetes lack canonical H3. Phylogenetically,

the two proteins appear not to be separate, early-branching lineages, as distinct H3 and H3.3 histones have arisen
multiple times [3]. A second common H3 variant is centromeric H3 (CenH3) essential for recruitment of kinetochore components vital to mitosis. CenH3s retain only
~50% identity to H3s in the HFD and have divergent
N-terminal tails from 20 to 200 residues. CenH3 phylogeny is poorly resolved. They appear to have arisen many
times with rapid divergence under positive selection.
There are also lineage-specific meiotic and spermatogenesis H3 variants [15].
Among core histones, H2As have evolved the greatest
variant diversity. There are two nearly universal variants,
H2AX and H2A.Z. H2AX plays an important role in the
maintenance of eukaryotic genome integrity by participating in double-strand DNA-break (DSB) repair by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). H2AX has arisen multiple
times during evolution but similar constraints have led to
convergent acquisition of the H2AX-specific phosphorylation motif SQE/DF (F = hydrophobic residue) [3]. Phosphorylation of the S residue in this C-terminal motif forms
gH2AX, which assists in the recruitment of histone modifiers, chromatin remodelers and DNA repair complexes.
H2AX has entirely replaced canonical H2A in fungi and
giardia [3,16] but is absent in C. elegans and protozoan
parasites, Plasmodium and trypanosomes. H2A.Z had a
single evolutionary origin, and has remained distinct from
canonical H2A [17]. It is essential for viability in a range
of species, [18-20] and is implicated in gene activation,
chromosome segregation, heterochromatin silencing, and
cell cycle progression [21]. A common thread in a number
of these disparate roles may be the proclivity of H2A.Z to
form more stably positioned nucleosomes [18] combined
with differential use of PTMs. Other H2A variants include
the C-terminally extended macroH2A, the C-terminally
truncated mammalian H2A.Bbd and an array of more
poorly studied lineage-specific variants.
Linker H1 variants form a complex family and subtypes
are classified as canonical RD (H1.1-H1.5 in human) or
RI linker histones (H1x and H1.0 in human). They display tissue and developmental specificity, with vertebrates
commonly expressing testes-specific (H1t, H1T2, Hils1)
and oocyte-specific (H1oo) variants [22]. Structurally,
metazoan H1s are divided into three domains: a short,
flexible N-terminal, a globular domain containing a
winged-helix fold and a long, lysine rich C-terminal tail.
H1 variants differ in biophysical properties, association
with repressed or active chromatin and their ability to
increase or decrease transcription when over-expressed.
The above picture is derived from histone sequence comparisons in a wide array of eukaryotes, but to date, very few
full histone complements have been analyzed more comprehensively and information is principally restricted to
universal variants as well as some lineage-specific variants

in mammals and plants. Modification of metazoan histone
variant lineages occurs on a background of genome architecture that shows global similarities from sponges to vertebrates [23] but the urochordate, Oikopleura dioica (Od), a
member of the closest sister group to vertebrates, demonstrates that this ancestral genome architecture can be profoundly modified [24]. In this fast-evolving, pan-global
zooplankton, a repertoire of >18000 genes has been extraordinarily compacted into a genome of only 70 Mb, with
sizes of introns and intergenic regulatory regions greatly
reduced. Whereas other chordates generally grow through
cell proliferation, rapid growth of O. dioica over a short,
6-day life cycle is achieved principally through endoreduplication [25]. Here, we characterize the highly diverse histone
complement that has emerged in concert with evolution of
this intriguing lineage at the invertebrate-vertebrate
transition.

Results
Histone gene organization in Oikopleura dioica

Histone genes were dispersed throughout the O. dioica
(Od) genome with most in clusters up to quintets. In
total, 47 histone genes (6 H4, 10 H3, 15 H2A, 11 H2B
and 5 H1 genes) encoding 31 different histone proteins
(2 H4, 6 H3, 11 H2A, 7 H2B and 5 H1) were identified
(Figure 1). Clustered genes showed typical RD features.
They were intron-less and most shared divergent promoters. Primary transcripts of these genes contain both
a conserved SL and a downstream polyadenylation
(polyA) signal in their 3’ UTRs but lack the histone
downstream element [26,27]. A second set of histone
genes were present as orphan genes: 3 H3 (H3.3, CenH3
and H3t.3), 2 H1 (H1.3 and H1.4) and 2 H2A isoforms
(H2A.3 and H2A.Z). These genes have introns (except
H2A.3 and H3t.3) and the SL is degenerate or absent
(Additional File 1, Table S1), suggesting they are RI variants. To assess phylogeny among histone families,
unrooted maximum likelihood trees were generated. As
expected, genes encoding the same histone protein were
more closely related and the most divergent histones
exhibited the longest branch lengths (Additional File 1,
Fig. S1). Clusters I, IX and XI, had the same H2A and
H2B phylogenies and likely result from more recent
gene duplications.
To compare the O. dioica histone complement to that
of other urochordates we extended genome searches to
the histone genes of two ascidians, Ciona intestinalis and
Ciona savignyi. Surprisingly, we found that the histone
complements of the two ascidians differed significantly in
terms of histone gene number and organization. The
C. savignyi genome (~180 Mb) contains a high number
(~130) of histone genes partly organized in large clusters,
whereas the C. intestinalis genome (~156 Mb) encoded
only 27 histone genes, mostly interspersed among non-

histone genes. A locus within the C. savignyi genome was
found where histone genes are arranged similarly to the
tandem-arrays of sea urchin and Drosophila. Table 1
shows that histone gene complements and their organization can differ considerably even over modest phylogenetic distances.
Expression of histone gene clusters is developmentally
co-regulated

We assessed expression profiles of all histone genes
throughout development by qRT-PCR, including
maturing males and females. O. dioica histone genes
were co-regulated in clusters and most genes belonging to the same locus showed the same developmental
expression profiles (Figure 2). Histone clusters could
be assigned to seven expression patterns: 1) throughout the life cycle (Figure 2A) 2) exclusively during
organogenesis (Figure 2B), 3) male-specific expression
in mature D6 animals (Figure 2C), 4) expression peaking in early tadpoles and male D5 animals (Figure 2E),
5) expression peaking at metamorphosis (Figure 2F), 6)
expression primarily in D3 and D4 animals (Figure 2G)
and 7) transcripts predominantly present from 1 h
post-fertilization (pf) to D4 (Figure 2H). Histone isoforms exhibiting multiple changes in amino acid
sequence were commonly male-specific. However,
some divergent core histone variants displayed expression profiles that preceded gonad maturation in D3/D4
adults (H2A.3 and H2B.3) (Figure 2G), from 1 h pf to
D4 (H2A.4) (Figure 2H) or after organogenesis and in
late adults at D5 (H2B.4) (Figure 2E).
To improve resolution of germline-specific expression
of different histone proteins, maturing D5/D6 animals
were dissected and cDNAs prepared separately from
testes, ovaries and trunks. Expression ratios were up to
4300-fold higher in testes and 330-fold higher in ovaries
for certain isoforms (Figure 3). Extrapolation of ovaryspecific transcripts to oogenic function is complicated
by maternal mRNA storage in oocytes during vitellogenesis. Taking this into account, only H2A.3 was clearly
significantly enriched in the ovary (Figure 3).
The potential combinatorial possibilities of histone
core and linker isoforms based on their transcript levels
throughout development are schematically summarized
in Figure 4. During organogenesis, transcript levels of all
canonical histones were increased by the activation of
additional, organogenesis-specific histone gene loci. At
least one male specific isoform exists in each of the five
histone families, including a male-specific H4t isoform.
Mass spectrometry of O. dioica core histones from mature
sperm and whole animals

O. dioica core histones were prepared for mass spectrometry from D4 and D6 animals, which include endocycling

Figure 1 O. dioica histone gene complement. Histone clusters consist of 2-5 genes dispersed throughout the genome (loci given as roman
numerals). Genes belonging to a given cluster were transcriptionally co-regulated and developmental expression profiles of the clusters are
indicated with icons (key: H, hatching; ETP, early tadpole; TS, tailshift; D3/4/5, day 3/4/5). Expression of histone genes is mostly driven from short
bidirectional promoters, with the exception of several replacement variants (H3.3, H2A.Z, H1.4, H1.3 and CenH3) dispersed as orphan genes.
Expression was undetectable for a truncated H3 (H3sh, cluster VIII), likely to be a pseudogene. Light grey arrows indicate non-histone genes.

gonads and female and male meiotic nuclei of D6 animals
(Additional File 1 Fig. S2). Histone sequence coverage by
LC-MS/MS ranged from 51% (H3) to 90% (H4) and most
peptides were identified several times (Figure 5). Many
conserved PTMs associated with transcriptional activity
and silent chromatin in other species were identified. The
N- and to a lesser extent, C-termini, of O. dioica H3, H4
and H2B contained numerous acetylated lysine residues
(Figure 5 and Additional File 1, Fig. S3). Conserved sites

for mono-, di-, and trimethylations such as H4K20,
H3K27, H3K36, H3K79 and ubiquitylation of H2BK114
(H2B.1K120 in mammals) were observed, though trimethylation of H4K20 and H3K79 were not detected. Peptides were found for canonical H2B.1 and/or H2B.2
monomethylated at R72 and dimethylated at their last Cterminal K residues as well as the dimethylation of H4 at
R55. We found few or no peptides unique to the divergent
variants H2B.3, H2B.4, H2A.3, H2A.4 and CenH3, possibly
due to low abundance. The large number of histone

Figure 2 O. dioica histone gene expression profiles throughout development. qRT-PCR of histone genes from 12 developmental stages
(see D): oo (oocytes), 2-8c (2-8 cells), 1h (1h postfertilization (pf)), TB (tailbud, 2.5 h pf), H (hatched, 3 h pf), ETP (early tadpole 5-7 h pf), TS
(tailshift metamorphosis, 9-12 h pf), D2/3/4/5/6 (Day 2/3/4/5/6). Expression patterns were classed in 7 profiles. Determinations were performed
on two technical replicates on each of two biological population replicates (P1, P2). Histone genes within a cluster were transcriptionally coregulated and had the same developmental profiles (A, C). A) The majority of canonical histone genes and several replacement variants such as
H3.3 were expressed throughout development. B) All canonical histones had additional gene loci exclusively expressed during organogenesis. C)
Male-specific expression of the histone gene cluster at locus I. Male- (♂) and female (♀) only samples were included. E) Expression peaking in

metamorphosis and decreased to D5. G) Genes for the divergent histone variants H2A.3 and H2B.3 are not clustered but were both

variants expressed in testes led us to investigate their
retention in mature sperm. Mass spectrometry of histones
isolated from mature sperm revealed many peptides specific for canonical and male-specific O. dioica histone isoforms (Additional File 1, Table S2).
O. dioica core H4s

Whereas other multicellular organisms express a single H4
isoform, O. dioica expresses two histone H4s, canonical
H4.1 and a male-specific H4t. The major H4.1 subtype

was expressed from five genes, with three expressed
throughout development and genes at loci II and XII
peaking at organogenesis (Figure 1). The H4t gene, located
in a male-specific histone gene cluster (Figure 1 and 2C)
was specifically expressed in D6 males, with a >3200
enrichment in testes compared to ovaries (Figure 3). H4tspecific peptides were found by mass spectrometry in
O. dioica sperm histones (Additional File 1, Table S2).
Within the H4t amino acid sequence V21 and L22 are
replaced by I21 and M22, in a region of the H4 N-terminal

mammals (Additional File 1, Fig. S4). Structurally, all
OdH2B proteins (Figure 5C) have short N-terminal tails
compared to other chordate H2Bs and none of the isoforms contain K/R-rich motifs characteristic of H2Bs
retained in echinoderm sperm [29].

H2A-H2B dimer (Figure 5B). There is also a third residuechange within the a2 helix, where A69 is replaced by S.
Based on H4 structure, S69 is not solvent accessible, facing
towards the alpha 3 helix of H4.
O. dioica H2B isoforms are expressed before onset and
during spermatogenesis

No replacement variants have been identified among
H2Bs and all OdH2B genes are intron-less and contain
the SL in their 3’UTR (Additional File 1, Table S1).
OdH2B.1 and H2B.2, were expressed throughout development (Figure 1), while the other 5 H2B isoforms
showed different levels of enrichment in testes. Whereas
H2Bt.1, H2Bt.2 and H2Bt.3 were exclusively expressed
in testes, with an increase up to >3500-fold compared to
ovaries (Figure 3), the divergent H2B.3 gene was
expressed at D3/D4, preceding spermatogenesis (Figure
2G) and divergent H2B.4 expression peaked in early tadpoles and D5 (Figure 2E). Intriguingly, these two divergent H2B isoforms display complementary expression
patterns (Figure 2E vs 2G) centered around the D3/D4
transition when germline differentiation commences.
H2B.3 and H2B.4 have reduced sequence identity to
somatic O. dioica H2B.1 (65% and 40%, respectively) but
do not show significant similarities to testes-specific
H2BFWT of mammals, which also shows reduced
sequence identity (45%) to mammalian somatic H2B
[28]. Mammalian testes-specific H2Bs of the type
TSH2B/TH2B have few residue changes compared to
their canonical counterparts, but all share three substitutions within their HFD, I41, G60 and N67. Interestingly, canonical OdH2Bs share these same residue
substitutions and therefore have slightly higher sequence
similarity to testes-specific rather than somatic H2Bs of

The O. dioica H3 complement comprises all universal H3
variants but lacks mammalian-specific H3.1. OdH3.2 and
H3.3 are 100% identical in amino acid sequence to vertebrate orthologs (Figure 5A). Additionally, O. dioica
expressed three male-specific H3 isoforms (H3t.1, H3t.2
and H3t.3) highly enriched in testes (Figure 3). H3t.1 and
H3t.2 contained a fully conserved SL and were co-regulated within a male-specific histone gene cluster (Figure
2C, 1 locus XVII and IX), whereas H3t.3 was expressed
from an orphan gene with a degenerate SL (Additional
File 1, Table S1), indicative of a replacement variant.
Within chordates, testes-specific H3 variants have only
been reported from mammals. OdH3ts, however, are
more divergent than mammalian H3ts when compared
to canonical H3.1/H3.2. OdH3t.3 has three residue substitutions in the N-terminal tail and ten in the histone
fold, whereas mammalian H3ts exhibit only one and two
substitutions, respectively. OdH3ts and mammalian H3ts
share no common residue changes and phylogenetic
analyses indicate that the H3ts of O. dioica are more
closely related to other OdH3s than to mammalian H3ts
(data not shown). We did not find similar H3t genes
within the genomes of the two Ciona species, suggesting
these isoforms might be specific to the appendicularian
lineage. A notable substitution within the N-terminus of
H3t.3 is the change of A31 to a phosphorylatable T residue. The same position in H3.3 is S, which is phosphorylated in mitosis and meiosis and is the only known
H3.3-specific modification [30,31]. Within the histone
fold, the most apparent sequence changes of the
OdH3ts are exposed on the disc surface of the nucleosome, surrounding K79, a conserved site for methylation
which was present in O. dioica canonical H3s (Figure
5A). Further residue changes occur at positions relevant
for intranucelosomal interactions. Within loop 2 (L2)
and a-helix 3, I119 and I124, which make contact with
loop 1 (L1) and a-helix 3 of H4, respectively, are
replaced by V119 and E124.
Another intron-containing H3 gene lacking the SL
encodes a divergent H3 replacement variant that we
identified as the O. dioica centromeric H3. OdCenH3
shows characteristic CenH3 features: a very divergent
N-terminal tail, its L1 loop is extended and F84 in L2,
which interacts with the L1 of H4, is replaced by W.
When expressed as an eGFP fusion protein, OdCenH3
specifically localized to the centromeres of O. dioica
chromosomes [32].

Figure 4 Histone deployment throughout O. dioica development. Developmental times are indicated with reference to predominance of
different cell cycle types (bottom). Cartoons (top) illustrate potential combinatorial possibilities of histone core (wedges: H4s grey, H3s yellow,
H2As blue, H2Bs green), and linker H1 (rectangles: orange to red) variants through development. Histone transcripts are represented as lines with
thickened portions indicating significant increases either through greater transcriptional activity of a given gene or contributions from additional
genes encoding the same variant. The latter was observed for canonical histones of all types during organogenesis with activation of additional
genes. All core and linker histones are represented by at least one male-specific isoform (at right).

O. dioica H2As: H2A.Z-splice variants but no H2AX

Similar to vertebrates, the H2A family is the largest and
most diverse group of core histones in O. dioica. H2A.1,
encoded by 5 genes, exhibits the highest identity to
canonical vertebrate H2As. H2A.1 and H2A.2, both
expressed throughout development, differ by a single
amino acid change from A to S at position 13 (confirmed by ESTs). O. dioica also expresses six male-specific isoforms (H2At.1, H2At.2, H2At.3, H2Asq.1,
H2Asq.2 and H2Asq.3) and two divergent replacement
variants, H2A.3 and H2A.4, lacking the SL (Additional
File 1, Table S1). Comparing the H2Asq and H2At proteins with each other and with H2A.1, they mainly differ

in their N-terminal tails and their docking domain,
which interacts with the H3-H4 tetramer (Figure 5D).
Nevertheless, all male-specific H2As share residue
changes in structurally important regions such as: the
H2A self-dimerization domain, within L2 that interacts
with the H2B L1, DNA contacts, and residues in the a2
helices that interact within the H2A-H2B dimer.
OdH2As have short C-terminal tails compared to vertebrate H2As.
No macroH2A gene was identified in O. dioica. More
surprising was the finding that no OdH2As contained
the PIKK substrate SQE/DF phosphorylation motif that
characterizes all H2AXs. Three male-specific O. dioica

Figure 5 Protein sequence alignment of O. dioica histone variants, including identified PTMs. Dots indicate identical residues to the top
reference sequence for each group. Histone secondary structure motifs are indicated above the reference sequences: loops (Lx), N- and Cterminal tails of the core histones (lines), alpha helices (rectangles), N-terminal tail of H1 (dashed line), H1 globular domain (black line), H1 Cterminal region (dotted line). For H2B and H2A, a vertebrate consensus sequence was generated by aligning canonical histones from chicken,
zebrafish, Xenopus and human: “x” indicates variable residues in the consensus. PTMs identified by mass-spectrometry are shaded in different
colors as indicated in the key: Me1-3, mono- to tri-methylation, Ac, acetylation; Ub, ubiquitinylation; put. phospho. sites, putative phosphorylation
sites. PTMs previously reported from vertebrates are indicated in the consensus sequences. Novel O. dioica modifications are shaded without a
corresponding PTM-tag in the reference sequence. Some intra- and inter-nucleosomal interaction sites are indicated in different colored bold
with underlines: A) H3 a2 interaction (black) with a2 of H4. B) H4 residues 16-25 (black) interact with the acidic patch of H2A. C) H2B residues
(black) interacting with the a2 of H2A and H2B residues (green) that interact as part of a 4-helix bundle with H4. D) H2A residues within L1 that
form the H2A self-dimerization domain (blue), residues interacting with the a2 of H2B (black), docking domain that makes contact with the H3H4 tetramer (bracket) and residues in the acidic patch on the nucleosome disc surface (orange).

H2A isoforms (H2Asq.1, H2Asq.2, H2Asq.3) contain a
putative phosphorylation SQ-motif, adjacent to the Cterminal alpha helix, as a result of a residue change
from A104 to S (Figure 5D). Although this SQ-motif
could present an alternative phosphorylation site for
PIKKs, its location in the docking domain makes it less
solvent accessible than the typical position of the SQE/
DF-motif at the end of the C-terminal tail. We conclude there is no H2AX homolog in O. dioica.

The OdH2A.Z variant exhibits the specific divergent
characteristics with respect to H2A.1 described for universal H2A.Zs, including a highly positive N-terminal
tail, a divergent L2, and divergent self-dimerization and
docking domains. Further, H2A.Z-specific substitutions
are present, including the replacement of N94 with D,
which extends the acidic patch, a substitution of E104
by G and the presence of two solvent accessible histidines (H123, H125 in OdH2A.Z). OdH2A.Z differs from

Moosmann et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:208
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/208

consensus H2A.Z sequences at several residues that are
invariant in higher eukaryotes and similar in position to
residue changes in Tetrahymena H2A.Z (Figure 6A).
These include three non-conservative amino acid substitutions in the self-dimerization domain (K50-A53 in
OdH2A.Z), two S-residues (S61, S62) replacing two Aresidues within the a2 helix and substitution of S by M
at position 109, adjacent to the acidic patch. Similar to
Tetrahymena H2A.Z, the OdH2A.Z C-terminal tail lacks
one of two conserved K-residues that are mono-ubiquitylated in mammalian heterochromatin. Another atypical
feature of OdH2A.Z is extension of a comparatively
short H2A.Z C-terminal tail by 10 amino acids containing a “PPQPPQ” motif.
A further similarity to Tetrahymena H2A.Z is the long
N-terminal tail of OdH2A.Z, extended by 11, mainly G,
K, and A residues. H2A.Z N-terminal tails of higher
eukaryotes harbor several GK-repeats that can be acetylated (Figure 6A). Intriguingly, we found that O. dioica
is able to modify the number of GK-motifs within its
H2A.Z N-terminal tail by alternative splicing. Alternative splice acceptor sites within the second exon of the
OdH2A.Z gene, result in shortening of the N-terminus
by precisely one (H2A.Zb) or two (H2A.Zc) of the first
three GK-pairs (Figure 6B). Full length OdH2A.Za was
predominantly expressed, but all three isoforms were
present throughout development.

Page 11 of 18

We also identified two additional H2A variants that
did not resemble any universal or lineage-specific H2A
variants. H2A.3 and H2A.4 showed 78% amino acid
sequence identity to each other but ≤55% identity with
other OdH2As. From the N-terminal tail to the a2
helix, H2A.4 and H2A.3 show almost no amino acid
sequence conservation to canonical H2A.1. Similar to
H2A.Z, both variants differed significantly in the selfdimerization domain, within L2 and in their docking
domains, but do not show typical features in primary
structure described for the mammalian H2A.Bbd. As for
the OdH2B subtype H2B.3, H2A.3 was predominantly
restricted to D3/D4 animals (Figure 2G) and transcripts
were enriched in the ovary (Figure 3). Expression of
H2A.4 commenced after zygotic gene activation and
decreased significantly when animals began to mature
after D4 (Figure 2H).
O. dioica linker H1s

We identified 5 OdH1 genes encoding 5 different H1 proteins. With the exception of D6 males, H1.1 was expressed
at every stage of development (Figure 4), while H1.3 and
H1.4 were expressed from 1 h pf to D5, peaking during
metamorphosis (Figure 2F). H1.1, H1.3 and H1.4 were the
dominant H1s throughout development (Figure 4), while
H1.2 and H1t were restricted to organogenesis and testes,
respectively (Figure 2A,C). The H1.1, H1.2 and H1t genes

Figure 6 O. dioica expresses three H2A.Z N-terminal tail splice variants. A) A common first exon donor site can be alternatively spliced
(arrows) to three different acceptor sites in the second exon of OdH2A.Z “GK” splice variant amino acid sequences, resulting in 3 different ORFs
encoding 3 H2A.Z sequence variants. Variants, V1 (blue), V2 (light blue) and V3 (dark blue) contained 4, 3 and 2 N-terminal GK motifs,
respectively. Compared to H2A.Zs of other species (ci, Ciona intestinalis; hs, Homo sapiens; sp, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus; dm, Drosophila
melanogaster; tt, Tetrahymena thermophila), Od and tt H2A.Zs have extended N- and C-terminal tails. OdH2A.Z-specific substitutions in the selfdimerization domain (underlined in yellow, K51-A54), in the a2 helix (S62-S63) and adjacent to the acidic patch (M110) are indicated. B) A 15%

are intron-less, located within histone clusters, and contain
the SL (Additional File 1, Table S1). Variants H1.3 and
H1.4 were expressed from orphan genes that contain one
intron and a degenerate SL, suggesting replacement variant function.
Increased content of positively charged residues and tail
length have been reported to strengthen binding affinity,
whereas phosphorylation at S/TPXK motifs weakens H1
binding and destabilizes chromatin structures [33]. The
N-terminal tails of O. dioica H1s are short in comparison
to H1 subtypes of mammals with H1.1, H1.3 and H1.4
also having short C-terminal tails (Figure 5E). OdH1.2
contains the most extended C-terminus and has the highest content of positively charged residues (31% vs 28% for
H1.1, H1.4, H1t and 26% in H1.3). It is also the only O.
dioica linker histone with two phosphorylation motifs
within the C-terminus, while H1.1, H1.3, H1.4 have one.
This may suggest that among O. dioica linker histones,
H1.2, restricted to early development, has the widest range
of binding affinities, a feature that may facilitate chromatin
remodeling events during embryogenesis. In contrast,
OdH1t, the shortest linker histone, lacks the conserved
phosphorylation motif, suggesting a more restricted binding affinity range.

Discussion
Analyses of histone complements of higher eukaryotes
have been published for metazoans such as Drosophila
[34,35], human and mouse [36], chicken [37], C. elegans
[38]Xenopus [39] and sea urchin [40]. Comprehensive
developmental expression data is only available for the sea
urchin histone complement. Here we show that the genome of the urochordate O. dioica encodes a high diversity
of histone isoforms. As in other organisms, the canonical
histone genes are organized as clusters and share divergent
promoters, though in contrast to Drosophila, sea urchin
and mammals, the histone genes have not remained physically linked in one or two large clusters or tandem repeats.
Instead they are dispersed in small groups throughout the
genome, similar to the C. elegans histone complement.
Organization of the O. dioica histone complement exhibited limited affinity with the sister urochordate ascidian
species, C. intestinalis or C. savignyi, which in turn, differed significantly from each other. Therefore, developmental mode (e.g. rapid early cleavages), genome size, and
phylogenetic relationship do not appear to be overriding
determinants of histone gene organization.
Histone modification patterns and genome size

A current view is that histone modifications become more
complex from unicellular eukaryotes to mammals [41,42].
Lysine acetylation of H3 and H4 N-terminal tails, as well
as methylated H3K4, H3K36 and H3K79 are considered
active marks, while methylated H3K9, H3K27 and H4K20

Page 12 of 18

mark silent chromatin. Combined with previous studies
[43,44] the mass spectrometry data now indicate that all
conserved “ON” and “OFF” marks are present on O. dioica
histones. Whereas unicellular eukaryotes, such as yeast,
Tetrahymena and Plasmodium principally exhibit modifications associated with transcriptional activation, mammals also employ a wider range of marks involved in gene
silencing [41,42]. The observation that hallmarks of
silenced chromatin such as H3K9 and H3K27 methylation
are low in yeast and Tetrahymena [41] has been explained
by the fact that the majority of the genome in unicellular
eukaryotes is transcriptionally competent, whereas more
than 60% of the mammalian genome is permanently
silenced and only ~3% of its DNA encodes structural
genes [45]. Considering the high gene density of the
O. dioica genome (one gene per 4-5 kb) and the short
intergenic regions, we also expect the proportion of the
O. dioica genome that is permanently silenced to be relatively low compared to that of human. However, our analysis revealed no obvious lack of silent heterochromatic
marks in O. dioica, since methylation of H3K27 (Additional File 1, Fig. S3) and H4K20 were detected by mass
spectrometry and methylation of H3K9 has been confirmed by immunofluorescence [44]. In the unicellular
eukaryotes, Plasmodium, Tetrahymena and S. cerevisiae,
protein coding sequence accounts for ~60, 40, and 70%, of
the respective genomic sequences [41,42] whereas they
account for ~44% of the genome in the multicellular Neurospora crassa [46] and O. dioica [24]. Despite a higher
proportion of protein coding sequence than Tetrahymena,
the latter two organisms do not exhibit the same reduction
in repressive chromatin marks as the former three, suggesting that augmentation of repressive marks is more
associated with increased developmental complexity/cell
type specification than with the global percentage of transcriptionally inactive genomic regions per se.
A developmental cell cycle switch in linker H1 variants

The number of linker histone subtypes identified across
multicellular organisms is quite variable compared to core
histone families. At least 11 linker histones are expressed
in human and mice, the C. elegans genome encodes 8 H1
isoforms, but only one linker histone is known in Drosophila [22,35]. The 5 OdH1 proteins contain comparatively
short N- and C-terminal tails. The only linker histone type
with similarly short C- and N-termini in vertebrates is
H1.0, a replacement variant present mainly in terminally
differentiated cells but also found in cells that have entered
a prolonged inter-mitotic period [47]. OdH1.1 and the
replacement variants OdH1.3 and OdH1.4 have the shortest C-termini and we found them to be the only H1 isoforms present in the endocycling stages of O. dioica, when
the majority of cell fates are definitively determined and
these cells no longer undergo mitosis. Furthermore, they

Moosmann et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:208
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/208

contain only one S/TPXK motif, while OdH1.2, which is
restricted to the mitotic stages of O. dioica, has two. Endocycling chromatin may not require the same extent of
dynamic modulation as is necessary to regulate a mitotic
cell cycle. This may result in the deployment of linker histones with a less dynamic range of binding affinities
expected from the short OdH1.1, OdH1.3 and OdH1.4
proteins.
Absence and innovation in the O. dioica histone H2A
complement

The absence of H2AX raises interesting questions about
genome integrity and the double-strand break (DSB)repair pathway in O. dioica. Rapid phosphorylation of
H2AX generating gH2AX [48] is central to both of the
alternative DNA repair pathways, nonhomologous endjoining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR),
which compete for DSB in eukaryotic cells [49]. Nevertheless, H2AX is dispensable for HR during meiosis in
H2AX-deficient mice [50] and the MRE11-Rad50-NBS1
repair complex is able to recruit repair and signaling proteins to DSB sites in the absence of H2AX [51]. HR efficiency is influenced by template accessibility, causing an
up regulation of HR during S and G2 phases of the cell
cycle when sister chromatids are available [52]. The challenge of locating a homologous template for HR repair
may not be an obstacle in the compact genome of O.
dioica, where up to several hundred copies of each locus
[25] are available for recombination in endocycling cells. It
is therefore possible that DSBs arising in endocycling cells
of O. dioica that do not traverse mitosis, could be repaired
by an H2AX-independent HR pathway. In support of this,
the O. dioica genome lacks many key components of the
NHEJ pathway [24], including DNA-PK, a key protein that
facilitates alignment of non-complementary ends and regulates end-processing. The observation that both H2AX
and DNA-PK are present in the sister class ascidian
C. intestinalis, indicates secondary loss of H2AX in the
appendicularian lineage as opposed to urochordates as a
whole having failed to evolve an H2AX variant.
H2A.Z is one of the best studied universal core histone
variants and, with the exception of CenH3, the only variant found to be essential in several species [18-20]. H2A.
Z can be found at active gene loci and the acetylation
mark is erased at the onset of mitosis [53], suggesting that
acetylation of its N-terminus may be required to lower
affinity for DNA and facilitate access for essential competing factors at promoters or to prevent higher order folding. Studies on H2A.Z (hv1) acetylation in Tetrahymena
revealed that acetylation of the N-terminus works to modulate an essential charge patch [54] and viable transformants could be obtained when all of the six K residues
within the N-terminus of H2A.Z were mutated to R as
long as a charge reducing mutation was also included.

Page 13 of 18

This suggests that the function of H2A.Z acetylation in
Tetrahymena, in contrast to a site-specific histone code, is
to alter the charge of the N-terminal domain. It is therefore intriguing that O. dioica uses alternative splicing to
control the number of acetylatable K residues in the N-terminus of H2A.Z. Deployment of H2A.Z splice variants
with altered numbers of acetylatable K residues would
seem less dynamic than simply modulating the acetylation
status of a fixed number of K-residues. However, in the
endoreduplicative cell cycle variant used predominantly
for growth in O. dioica, genes are disrupted transiently by
passage of the replication fork but do not undergo the
extensive condensation cycles occurring during the proliferative mitotic cell cycles characteristic of growth in most
chordates. On the other hand, a challenge during nonpolytene endocycles is to coordinately regulate hundreds
of copies of a given gene dispersed in a single interphase
nucleus [55]. In this situation, more fixed stepped levels of
charge, with a reduced dynamic modulation range may be
advantageous. The existence of two non-redundant H2A.Z
variants in vertebrates [56] displaying subtle differences in
their association with post translationally modified canonical histones and chromatin localization [57] suggests that
generation of different H2A.Z variants might not be an
uncommon strategy in animals to further extend the functional repertoire of H2A.Z proteins. As several metazoan
H2A.Zs contain a conserved intron directly following the
start ATG and possess multiple alternative splice acceptors within their second exon, it will be of interest to
determine whether generation of alternative splice H2A.Z
variants is not unique to O. dioica.
Variant male nucleosomes in O. dioica

O. dioica has a particularly high number of histone isoforms expressed exclusively or highly enriched in testes,
including 6 H2At, 5 H2Bt, 3 H3t and 1 H4t. Testes-specific histones are poorly studied but are thought to substitute for canonical histones in meiotic and post-meiotic
cells prior to replacement of histones by protamines [58].
Analyses of mammalian testes-specific H2As, H2Bs
[59,60] and H3s [61] indicate that nucleosomes containing these variants are less stable than those composed of
canonical histones. O. dioica histone isoforms exclusively
expressed in testes (H2At.1-H2At.2, H2Asq.1-H2Asq.3,
H2Bt.1-H2Bt.3, H3t.1-H3t.3) might affect intranucleosomal interactions. O. dioica H2At and H2Bt histones exhibit alterations in regions that promote stabilization of
interactions with the H3-H4 tetramer and within the
H2A-H2B dimer. Furthermore, several of the OdH2Bts
have shortened N-terminal tails, lacking the first 14-21
N-terminal residues (H2Bt.2, H2Bt.3), predicted to form
an a-helix in vertebrate H2Bs (residues 10-21) [62]. The
N-terminal tails of mammalian H2Bs are involved in
interactions with DNA, internucleosomal histone-DNA

Moosmann et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:208
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/208

interactions [63] and are important for the mitotic
and apoptotic condensation of chromosomes. Very divergent or short tails may be compromised in some of
these functions and result in further loss of nucleosome
stability. These features might provide the basis for
structural transitions and assembly of genomic subregions into altered DNA-packaging structures and/or
facilitate histone mobilization during male pronuclear
reprogramming.
Is there a testes-specific histone code in O. dioica?

The massive synthesis of histone variants, including
testes-specific members, and the stage-specific posttranslational modification of histones during spermiogenesis
have led to proposal of a testes-specific “histone code”
generated by combining both histone variants and
PTMs [64]. In zebrafish sperm, genes with embryonic
functions are embedded in distinctive, complex and atypical chromatin structures [65]. Hyperacetylation of histones is associated with histone replacement in early
elongating spermatids [66] and has been reported for
some testes-specific variants such as rat TH2B [67].
Consistent with this, we found several K residues within
the N- and C-termini of OdH2Bt.1 and H2Bt.2 to be
acetylated. Moreover, O. dioica tiling array data confirm
expression of a bromodomain-containing testes-specific
factor (BRDT) [32] that induces chromatin remodeling
in the presence of histone hyperacetylation in mammals
[68], possibly mediating nuclear reorganization during
spermiogenesis.
Residues exposed on the nucleosome disc surface may
in part account for the extreme evolutionary constraints
on histone sequences, since they interact with nuclear
factors and mediate internucleosomal interactions. Dot1
is the methyltransferase responsible for mono-, di-, and
trimethylation of H3K79, a residue exposed on the disc
surface within the globular domain of H3. H3K79
methylation (H3K79me) is found in euchromatin [69]
but the modification also plays an important role in heterochromatin formation in mice and yeast [70]. Interestingly, the residues surrounding K79 are substituted in
all male-specific H3ts of O. dioica. In H3t.3, not only
have the surrounding residues been modified, but K79
has been replaced by R, raising the possibility that the
OdH3t isoforms lack K79 methylation. These residues
are nearly invariant across species, though substitutions
are present in pollen-specific H3s of Arabidopsis and
rice, C. elegans H3.3 variants, and all H3s identified in
Plasmodium and Tetrahymena (Additional File 1, Fig.
S5). The fact that both Dot1 and K79 methylation are
absent in Arabidopsis [71,72] and Plasmodium [42,73]
may suggest that Dot1 binding could partially account
for evolutionary constraints on these residues. These
residues likely create a specialized nucleosome surface

Page 14 of 18

for Dot1 binding, as single mutations centered directly
around H3K79 distinctly affected the three typical forms
of yeast silencing (rDNA, telomere, and silent mating
loci silencing; [74]). A single R79 substitution, as in
OdH3t.3, weakened silencing of rDNA and the silent
mating loci but enhanced silencing at telomeres.
Together with the surrounding mutations found in the
other OdH3t variants this may indicate an inability of
Dot1 to methylate H3K79 in OdH3ts.
No H4 sequence variant has been described in higher
metazoans and the fact that O. dioica males express a H4
sequence variant appears unique. Expression of a malespecific H4 gene has been reported in rats [75], but this
transcript encodes an invariant H4 protein sequence. Two
of the residue changes in OdH4t occur within the N-terminal tail adjacent to the H4K20 methylation site, a core histone modification exposed on the nucleosome disc
surface. H4K20me3 affects internucleosomal interactions
resulting in more compact higher order chromatin structure [76]. In view of the extreme conservation of the H4
amino acid sequence across metazoans, also preserved in
the other 5 O. dioica H4.1 genes, a neutral function of
these mutations is questionable.

Conclusions
The traditional view of histones as slow evolving proteins
has changed considerably within the last decade. It is now
clear that histone variants have diversified in many species
to assume crucial roles in transcriptional activation, DNA
repair, chromosome segregation and other processes.
Recent data from more exotic model organisms such as
trypanosomes [77] and rotifers [78] increasingly link histone complement evolution to specific life history traits of
organisms. The results here show that there is considerable plasticity in histone gene organization and variation
within histone families even within the chordate lineage.
Of particular note among the high diversity of histone variants in the fast evolving appendicularian lineage, is a concentration of variation in all core and linker histone
families associated with differentiation of the male germline, raising intriguing questions regarding the testes as an
evolutionary playground for the innovation of histone
variants.
Methods
In silico- and phylogenetic analyses

BLAST searches of the Oikopleura genome [79,80] were
conducted using previously identified Oikopleura core
histone fold domain sequences or linker H1 globular
domain sequences [26] and H1 tunicate homologs. Since
these searches failed to isolate H2AX and macroH2A
variants, additional searches were performed including
the H2AX consensus motif SQE/DY and the Xenopus
macro H2A sequence, respectively. Sequences were

Moosmann et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:208
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/208

confirmed by ESTs, RACE or sequencing from qRT-PCR
products as indicated on the Oikopleura histone webpage
[81]. Methodological details on the phylogenetic analyses
of Oikopleura histone gene families are given in the
legend of Additional File 1, Figure 1. Amino acid substitutions were evaluated using 3D-structure predictions for
Oikopleura histone variants obtained from I-tasser [82]
with the crystal structure of the Xenopus nucleosome
specified as a template (PDB file 1kx5:A for histone H3,
1kx5:B for histone H4, 1kx5:C for histone H2A and 1kx5:
D for histone H2B). PDB files of Oikopleura histone variants were viewed and aligned to PDB files of nucleosome
crystal structures (PDB files 1kx5 and 1f66) in Pymol
(Version 1.2r3pre, Schrödinger, LLC). Databases and
browsers used for analyzing histone genes: Ensembl [83],
Histone database [84], Ciona savignyi database [85],
Ciona intestinalis JGI [86] and Ghost [87], and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus [40].
Animal culture and collection

O. dioica culture was performed as described [88]. For in
vitro fertilizations, females were collected in watch
glasses, washed with artificial seawater (Red Sea, final
salinity 30.4-30.5 g/l) and left to spawn. Sperm from 3-5
males was checked for viability and used for fertilization.
Embryos were left to develop at room temperature (RT)
and subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen. D2 - D6 animals were removed from houses and anaesthetized in
seawater containing 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester
(MS222, Sigma, 0.125mg/ml). For qRT-PCR at all developmental stages, animals from the same population were
used. Two replicate populations were characterized. For
preparation of histones, 4000 D4 and 1000 D6 animals
were poured against a glass plate to separate them from
their houses and collected in 1 L glass beakers. Sea water
was replaced two times by 500 ml of seawater-MS222
and beakers left on ice for 10 minutes to sediment and
harvest the animals. Mature sperm was collected by
allowing 200 males to spawn in Petri-dishes and the
sperm-sea water suspension was collected in 5 ml falcon
tubes. Sperm was sedimented in a Sorvall centrifuge (RT
6000 D), 3000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min. For testes and
ovary-specific samples, animals were selected and dissected as in [89].
Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR)

RNA extraction and first strand cDNA synthesis was
performed as previously [90]. cDNAs from the two
populations were controlled for genomic contamination
including RT- controls. Ribosomal protein 23 and elongation factor 1-beta expression levels were used as normalization controls using the comparative method of
relative quantification [91]. Histone primer (Additional

Page 15 of 18

File 1, Table S3) specificities were confirmed by sequencing directly from qRT-PCR products. After initial denaturation for 15 min at 95°C, 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec,
55°C or 58°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 30 sec were conducted, with a final extension for 5 min at 72°C.
Cloning of H2A.Z-splice variants

PCR was performed with CC212 forward (5’ GGCGCGCA
ACTGAGAGAAATC 3’) and CC213 reverse (5’CCAGCACTTCCGGCACC 3’) primers, flanking the alternative
splice sites with 5 μl D6 cDNA as template. After initial
denaturation for 5 min at 95°C, 35 cycles of 95°C for
20 sec, 56°C for 15 sec and 72°C for 15 sec were conducted, with a final extension for 3 min at 72°C. PCR products were run on a 15% acrylamid gel with a 10 bp
ladder (Promega). Bands were excised and acrylamid slices
crushed in 400 μl TE, 8.2 μl 5M NaCl with subsequent
nucleic acid precipitation by adding 1/10 vol 3M NaAc
and 2.5 vol cold 100% EtOH. Precipitated PCR fragments
were cloned into the Topo vector with the TOPO TA
Cloning kit (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
Preparation of O. dioica histones

Histones were extracted using a histone purification kit
(Active Motif; #40025) according to manufacturer’s
instructions and by the acid extraction method. For acid
extraction, Lysis buffer [1 × PBS, 0.5% Triton X 100
Sigma, 5 mM PMSF, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Sodiumbutyrate, 1× Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, P5726) was
added to frozen sperm or D4/D6 animals. D4/D6 animals
were dounced (Kontes Glass Company, 749520-0000) in
1.5 ml eppendorf tubes and sperm was sonicated in the
lysis buffer (vibra cell, amplitude 40, 2 mm sonicator). HCl
was added to 0.2 N and tubes were shaken vigorously for
2 h (D4/D6) at room temperature or overnight (sperm) at
4°C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at
13000 rpm at 4°C for 15 min and Trichloracetic acid was
added to 25% (vol/vol) to precipitate histones for 30 min
at 4°C. Precipitates were collected by centrifugation at
14000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C and the supernatant was
saved for later analysis. Histone pellets were washed twice
with 500 μl acetone containing 0.1% HCl and dissolved in
Laemmli loading buffer for subsequent mass-spectromery
and silver gel analyses. Purified histones were loaded on
15% SDS-PAGE gels and stained with the Silver Stain Plus
kit (Bio-Rad # 161-0461).
Mass spectrometry

Histones were loaded on 15% SDS-PAGE gels, excised,
reduced and alkylated [92]. Digests were performed
overnight with Trypsin (Promega) following elution
with trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were analysed using
a nano-high-pressure liquid chromatography Aligent

1100 nanoflow system connected online to a 7-Tesla
linear quadruple ion-trap Fourier transform mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron) [92]. Peptides were identified using the Mascot algorithm (MatrixScience) to
search a database containing the histone sequences of
Oikopleura. Initial search criteria were: Trypsin as
enzyme; peptide charge 1+, 2+, and 3+ with a peptide
tolerance of 10 parts per million for the parental
peptide and 0.6 Da for fragmentation spectra.
Fixed modifications were set to fixed carbamidomethyl
modification for cysteines. Oxidation of methionine,
deamidation (Q and N), acetylation (K), mono- and
dimethylation (K and R), trimethylation (K), phosphorylation (S, T and Y), and ubiquitinylation (K) were
searched as variable modifications. Parent ion masses
were internally calibrated by MSQuant [93] to obtain
accuracy better than five parts per million.
