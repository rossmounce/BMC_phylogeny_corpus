Abstract
Background: Zebrafish may prove to be one of the best vertebrate models for innate immunology. These fish have
sophisticated immune components, yet rely heavily on innate immune mechanisms. Thus, the development and
characterization of mutant and/or knock out zebrafish are critical to help define immune cell and immune gene functions
in the zebrafish model. The use of Severe Combined Immunodeficient (SCID) and recombination activation gene 1 and 2
mutant mice has allowed the investigation of the specific contribution of innate defenses in many infectious diseases.
Similar zebrafish mutants are now being used in biomedical and fish immunology related research. This report describes
the leukocyte populations in a unique model, recombination activation gene 1-/- mutant zebrafish (rag1 mutants).
Results: Differential counts of peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) showed that rag1 mutants had significantly decreased
lymphocyte-like cell populations (34.7%) compared to wild-types (70.5%), and significantly increased granulocyte
populations (52.7%) compared to wild-types (17.6%). Monocyte/macrophage populations were similar between mutants
and wild-types, 12.6% and 11.3%, respectively. Differential leukocyte counts of rag1 mutant kidney hematopoietic tissue
showed a significantly reduced lymphocyte-like cell population (8%), a significantly increased myelomonocyte population
(57%), 34.8% precursor cells, and 0.2% thrombocytes, while wild-type hematopoietic kidney tissue showed 29.4%
lymphocytes/lymphocyte-like cells, 36.4% myelomonocytes, 33.8% precursors and 0.5% thrombocytes.
Flow cytometric analyses of kidney hematopoietic tissue revealed three leukocyte populations. Population A was
monocytes and granulocytes and comprised 34.7% of the gated cells in rag1 mutants and 17.6% in wild-types. Population
B consisted of hematopoietic precursors, and comprised 50% of the gated cells for rag1 mutants and 53% for wild-types.
Population C consisted of lymphocytes and lymphocyte-like cells and comprised 7% of the gated cells in the rag1 mutants
and 26% in the wild-types.
Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays demonstrated rag1 mutant kidney hematopoietic
tissue expressed mRNA encoding Non-specific Cytotoxic cell receptor protein-1 (NCCRP-1) and Natural Killer (NK)
cell lysin but lacked T cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin (Ig) transcript expression, while wild-type kidney
hematopoietic tissue expressed NCCRP-1, NK lysin, TCR and Ig transcript expression.
Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that in comparison to wild-type zebrafish, rag1 mutants have a significantly
reduced lymphocyte-like cell population that likely includes Non-specific cytotoxic cells (NCC) and NK cells (and lacks
functional T and B lymphocytes), a similar macrophage/monocyte population, and a significantly increased neutrophil
population. These zebrafish have comparable leukocyte populations to SCID and rag 1 and/or 2 mutant mice, that possess
macrophages, natural killer cells and neutrophils, but lack T and B lymphocytes. Rag1 mutant zebrafish will provide the
platform for remarkable investigations in fish and innate immunology, as rag 1 and 2 mutant mice did for mammalian
immunology.

Background
The zebrafish has many advantages for use in immunological research. Zebrafish can mount innate and adaptive
immune responses much like higher vertebrates and their
genome demonstrates a high degree of synteny to the
human genome [1,2]. Current methods for targeted gene
silencing, the availability of many mutant strains and the
ease of producing specific mutants make the zebrafish an
excellent model for experimental immunology [3]. They
are phylogenetically one of the lowest vertebrates and rely
more than mammals on innate immune mechanisms,
and may prove to be one of the best models for innate
immunology. However, the development, propagation
and characterization of mutant and/or knock out
zebrafish are critical to help define immune cell and
immune gene functions in the zebrafish model. Much of
the research on inducible components of innate and
acquired immunity is based on in vitro research utilizing
isolated or cultured cells. These types of studies are useful
for dissecting specific mechanistic pathways but are artificial, in that unknown cellular interactions that occur in
the whole animal are removed from the system. With the
production of mutants and specific knock out mice, components of the immune system could be dissected in the
whole animal model. The use of SCID and rag 1 and 2
mutant mice has allowed the investigation of the specific
contribution of innate defenses in many infectious diseases. Both mutants have normally functioning macrophages, natural killer cells and neutrophils, but lack T and
B lymphocytes [4,5].
Similar mutants are now being used in biomedical and
fish immunology related research. Reverse genetics, the
ability to inactivate a given gene in an entire animal, is an
established technique in zebrafish research [1]. Targetselected mutagenesis was used to identify a series of 15
rag1 mutations. One of these was a point mutation that
causes a premature stop codon in the catalytic domain of
rag1 [6]. A functional RAG1 protein is required for V(D)J
recombination when generating functional immunoglobulin and T cell receptor (TCR) genes [7]. As in other vertebrates, there is only one functional rag1 gene; loss of
function at this locus results in a complete block of immunoglobulin gene assembly and, presumably, in immunodeficiency [6]. The aims of our project were to describe
leukocyte cell populations of adult rag1-/- (mutant) and
rag1+/+ (wild-type) zebrafish by morphologic and flow
cytometric analyses, and to determine the presence or
absence of leukocyte-associated transcripts by RT-PCR
assays.

Results
Differential leukocyte counts
Zebrafish non-erythroid peripheral blood cells included
thrombocytes, monocytes/macrophages, granulocytes,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/10/8

lymphocytes and lymphocyte-like cells. Thrombocytes
had round nuclei and very scant, faintly eosinophilic cytoplasm that was often irregular. The nuclear chromatin was
very dense. Lymphocytes and lymphocyte-like cells
included several populations that were round with a high
nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio. The cytoplasm stained pale
blue and was agranular. Smaller lymphocytes had a very
scant cytoplasm. Larger lymphocytes had a more granular
cytoplasm. Monocytes were large with a lower nuclear to
cytoplasmic ratio. Nuclear shape was round, indented or
bilobed, and the cytoplasm was granular, but not frothy.
Macrophages were large with a low nuclear to cytoplasmic
ratio. The nucleus was irregularly shaped. The cytoplasm
was frothy, or vacuolated, and often contained debris, and
the margin was often irregular. The granulocyte population was predominately two cell types: a myeloperoxidase
(mpo) positive neutrophil and an mpo negative eosinophil. The nuclei of neutrophils were multi-lobed and
the cytoplasm stained lilac or pale pink and was not obviously granular by light microscopy. Eosinophils had
eccentric nuclei. The cytoplasm stained pale pink and contained larger granules.
Comparisons of PBL differentials from mutants and wildtypes were 34.7% vs. 70.5% lymphocyte-like cells and
lymphocytes, 12.6% vs. 11.3% monocytes, and 52.7% vs.
17.6% granulocytes (Figure 1-I). Mutant lymphocyte-like
cell populations were significantly less than wild-type
lymphocyte/lymphocyte-like cell populations, and granulocyte populations were significantly greater compared to
wild-types. Average thrombocyte counts (per 100 leukocytes) were 519 ± 112 (mean ± SD) for mutants and 496
± 10.6 for wild-types. Comparisons of kidney hematopoietic tissue leukocyte differentials from mutants and wildtypes were 8% lymphocyte-like cells vs. 29.4% lymphocytes and lymphocyte-like cells, 57% vs. 36.4% myelomonocytes, 34.8% vs. 33.8% precursors and 0.2% vs.
0.5% thrombocytes (Figure 1-II). Again, mutant lymphocyte-like cell populations were significantly lower
than wild-types, and myelomonocyte populations were
significantly greater than in wild-types. Cell counts are
presented as percentage ± standard deviation.
Flow cytometry
Examination of mutant and wild-type kidney interstitial
cells by Fluoresence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) analysis
demonstrated three main cell populations (Figure 1-III
and 1-VI). On the basis of forward scatter (FSC) and side
scatter (SSC) properties and location in a FSC vs. SSC plot,
these populations were identified as monocytes/granulocytes/myelomonocyte precursors and designated A,
hematopoietic precursors designated B, and lymphocytes/
lymphocyte-like cells designated C. The FSC threshold
was set to exclude erythrocytes. DiOC6 and DiOC5 staining did not discriminate the zebrafish thrombocyte popu-

Mutant and wild-type zebrafish leukocyte differentials and flow cytometry scatter plots
Figure 1
Mutant and wild-type zebrafish leukocyte differentials and flow cytometry scatter plots. I and II represent differential counts on peripheral blood smears and kidney hematopoietic tissue smears, respectively. Asterisks indicate significant difference between wild-type and mutant blood cells within the specific population. Average percentage ± standard deviation
from 10 replicates is shown (p ≤ 0.05). III and IV show graphs of flow cytometric results on cells from mutant and wild-type
kidney tissues, respectively. Graphs represent pooled data from 4 runs on 4 separate mutant and wild-type fish. Forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) analyses of whole kidney cell suspension differentiates three distinct cell populations: A-macrophage/monocytes and granulocytes, B-hematopoietic precursor cells and C-lymphocytes and lymphocyte-like cells. Note the
reduction in gate C, characteristic of lymphocytes and lymphocyte-like cells, in mutant kidney cell suspensions.

lation from the small lymphocyte population. However,
differential counts of kidney hematopoietic tissue indicated thrombocytes were present at less than 1% in this
tissue, so discriminating thrombocytes was not necessary.
The number of cells with the characteristics of small lymphocytes was significantly reduced in mutant tissue: 7% of
gated cells comprised the lymphocyte-like cell population
in mutants whereas wild-types had a 26% lymphocyte/
lymphocyte-like cell population. We also observed an
increased population of monocytes/granulocytes/myelomonocytes in mutants (43%) over wild-types (21%) of
the gated cells.

RT-PCR analyses of mutant and wild-type zebrafish kidney
hematopoietic tissues
To determine if kidney hematopoietic tissue included
functional B cells, we evaluated mutants for expression of
immunoglobulin (Ig) transcripts with heavy-chain gene
rearrangements (VH1-Cm, VH2-Cm, VH3-Cm and VH4Cm). When evaluated using nested RT-PCR, the expected
products (Table 1) were obtained for all VH gene rearrangements in the wild-types but no products were
obtained from mutants (Figure 2-A). TCR genes in
zebrafish also undergo V(D)J recombination [8]. To test
for functional T cells we evaluated mutant and wild-type
RNA for expression of TCR β rearrangements using nested
RT-PCR and found expression for these rearrangements in
wild-types but no expression in mutants (Figure 2-B).

Protein-1 (NCCRP-1), and transcription elongation factor 1-α (EF1-α, as a positive control) in mutant and wild-type zebrafish
by RT-PCR. (A) Nested RT-PCR using primers spanning VDJ-Cm in Ig VH1-VH4 [16]. (B) Nested RT-PCR using primers spanning TCR V(D)J-Cβ [16]. (C) RT-PCR was used to analyze mRNA expression using primers specific for NCCRP-1, NK lysin
form 1, NK lysin forms 2 and 3 and EF1-α (primers are listed in Table 1). All RT-PCR assays included no-RT controls and no
product was obtained (data not shown).

These data indicate that mutant kidney hematopoietic tissue lacks functional T and B cells.
We also evaluated kidney hematopoietic tissue for the
expression of mRNA encoding NCCRP-1 and 3 forms of
NK lysin using RT-PCR. All RT-PCR assays demonstrated
similar amounts of product for mRNAs encoding these
NK and NCC specific proteins in mutants and wild-types
(Figure 2-C).

Discussion
Mutant zebrafish had significantly reduced lymphocyte/
lymphocyte-like cell populations and significantly
increased granulocyte populations. Hematological findings of the wild-type fish are comparable with published
values for zebrafish [9]. Published peripheral blood differential results from zebrafish [10] reported 81% lymphocytes, 8% monocytes and 11% granulocytes, and
these were comparable to the values we observed: 71%

lymphocytes, 11% monocytes and 18% granulocytes.
Zebrafish granulopoiesis and myelopoiesis have been
well described [11]. The morphologic and functional
characterization of macrophages and neutrophils (heterophils) have been further described [12]. Although leukocyte cell counts were significantly different between
mutants and wild-types, cell morphologies and staining
characteristics were comparable with each other, and
other published data referred to above. The thrombocyte
populations in mutant and wild-type peripheral blood
were statistically the same. Zebrafish thrombocytes have
been reported to not be readily distinguishable from lymphocytes [13], but a clear distinction could be made in our
study, and was also observed in another study [14].
Kidney hematopoietic tissue was used for flow cytometry,
so there was a greater hematopoietic precursor cell population than would be found in peripheral blood. Gate values and cell populations agreed with published flow
cytometry data [10,15,16]. Flow cytometry findings corroborate the leukocyte differential counts that demonstrated a significantly reduced lymphocyte/lymphocytelike cell population in the mutants. Flow cytometric quantifications of brown trout and rainbow trout peripheral

blood identified three cell populations that consisted of
erythrocytes, lymphocytes plus thrombocytes and neutrophils [17]. DiOC6 enhanced side scatter characteristics
of carp thrombocytes separated them from lymphocytes
[18], and DiOC6 and DiOC5 were also used to separate
avian cell populations [19]. Initial trials with DiOC6 were
not conclusive in zebrafish. Fortunately, thrombocyte percentages from mutant and wild-type kidney tissues were <
1%, so we did not need to correct for this cell type in our
flow cytometry analyses.
Hematopoiesis in zebrafish includes myelopoiesis that
forms the myelomonocyte precursor that further differentiates into two myeloid lineages, granulocytes and monocytes [20]. The granulocytes further differentiate into
heterophils and eosinophils [21]. The cell populations we
identified appeared to directly correlate with the four
main cell populations identified by Traver [10]: erythrocytes, lymphocytes, precursors, and myelomonocytes. In
flow cytometric analyses of zebrafish peripheral blood,
thrombocytes are included in the small lymphocyte fraction. However, as previously stated, we utilized kidney tissue for flow cytometry, and thrombocytes were rarely
found in kidney tissue.

The presence of mRNA encoding Ig heavy chain genes and
TCR β-chain in wild-type kidney hematopoietic tissue and
a lack of their expression in this tissue in mutants indicate
that functional T-cells and B-cells are lacking in mutants.
Wienholds et al [6] demonstrated a lack of Ig V(D)J
recombination using PCR on genomic DNA, but did not
evaluate gene expression or TCR gene expression. The RTPCR findings evaluating transcripts encoding NCCRP-1
and NK lysins suggest that NK-like and NCC cells are
present in mutant and wild-type kidney hematopoietic
tissue, and these cells likely account for much of the lymphocyte-like cell population observed in the flow cytometry findings. Fish possess both NK-like cells, and NCCs
[22]. Zebrafish mutants lacking rag1 expression demonstrated a marked reduction or absence of lymphoblasts in
the thymus [3], and an increased susceptibility to Mycobacterium marinum [23]. Rag1 mutant mice also lack functional T and B cells [5], while Rag 2 mutant mice have
functional NK cells [24].

Conclusion
Rag1t26683 mutant zebrafish provide a unique model for
investigating innate immune responses because fully
functional innate defenses are present without the influence of lymphocytes and presumably lymphocyte associated acquired immune responses. Macrophages are
present, as are lymphocyte-like cells, and a significantly
expanded granulocyte population. The rag 1 mutant
zebrafish provide the model to elucidate mechanisms of
the innate immune system and developmental immunology in fish. Wild-types and mutants were utilized in Mycobacterium
marinum
pathogenesis
studies
[23].
Additionally, rag1 has been shown to be expressed in
zebrafish olfactory neurons and rag1 negative zebrafish
mutants have been used to evaluate the role of rag1 in
olfactory neuron functions [25]. Future research will provide new tools to direct the level and type of fish immune
defenses against pathogens, and rag1 mutant zebrafish
provide the platform to investigate specific roles of NKlike cells, NCCs, macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils in fish immune responses.

15 mg/L chlorides, 85.5 mg/L bicarbonate alkalinity, and
pH 7.2. Adult zebrafish were fed Zeigler™ Adult Zebrafish
Diet (Aquatic Habitats™, Apopka, FL) and Golden Pearls
Larval Diet (Artemia International LLC, Fairview, TX)
brine shrimp (Artemia) nauplii twice daily (Aquatic EcoSystems, Inc., Apopka, FL). Embryos were provided by the
Tübingen 2000 Screen Consortium [27]. After rearing to
maturity, they were genotyped using a variation of methods previously described [6] and the PCR methods below.
Four homozygous rag 1-/- fish were group spawned to produce the rag 1-/- mutant zebrafish and twenty rag 1+/+ fish
were group spawned to produce the wild-type zebrafish
used in this study. All mutant and wild-type comparisons
were made between fish that were between 9 and 12
months old (adults).
Differential leukocyte counts
Blood was harvested from euthanized adult zebrafish by
making a lateral incision just posterior to the dorsal fin in
the region of the dorsal aorta [13]. Blood welling up from
this incision was collected in a heparinized 10 μl micropipette tip and used to prepare blood smears. Smears were
fixed and stained using a Hema-3 Stat Pack (Biochemical
Sciences, Inc., Swedesboro, NJ) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Blood cells were viewed on an Olympus BH-1 microscope. Differential leukocyte counts were
performed based on morphological appearance, and cells
were identified based on previous descriptions of
zebrafish or comparative teleosts [12,13,28,29]. Differential counts were made on ten mutants and ten wild-type
adult zebrafish. One hundred leukocytes were counted on
each slide. Thrombocyte numbers were determined by
counting the number of thrombocytes seen while counting 100 leukocytes. Differential leukocyte counts on kidney tissue were done as described above except smears
were made from cell suspensions produced from excised
kidney tissue. Cell counts are presented as percentage ±
standard deviation. Statistical significance was determined using independent Student's t-test. Statistical significance was accepted at p ≤ 0.05. Statistical analyses
were performed using SPSS for Windows 15.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL).

Methods
Mutant and wild-type zebrafish production
Zebrafish used in this study were propagated and reared in
the College of Veterinary Medicine's Specific Pathogen
Free Fish Hatchery following our Standard Operating Procedures, 2006, CVM-MSU http://www.cvm.msstate.edu/
zebrafish/index.html, and housed in a customized
zebrafish system [26]. Briefly, adult zebrafish were held in
19 L tanks with charcoal filtered de-chlorinated municipal
water at 28°C supplied to each tank at a rate of 0.5 L/min
in a flow through, single pass system. Air stones were
added to each tank to provide aeration. Water quality
parameters were 85.5 mg/L calcium carbonate hardness,

Flow cytometry
Flow cytometric analyses of mutant and wild-type kidney
interstitial cells involved forward scatter (FSC) and side
scatter (SSC) determinations on a FACS Calibur (Becton
Dickinson). Forward scatter (FSC) represents cell diameter, and side scatter (SSC) represents cell granularity or
complexity. The kidney from each of four mutants and
four wild-type adult zebrafish were processed. Each kidney was transferred into a centrifuge tube containing 200
μl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (0.8% NaCl, 0.02%
KCl, 0.02 M PO4, pH 7.3) supplemented with 1% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis. MI. Cells

were freed from the tissue by repeated pipetting using a
P1000 pipettor. The cell suspension was strained, using an
additional 200 μl PBS-FBS, through a 40 μm Falcon®
nylon cell strainer (Becton Dickinson) to eliminate connective tissue. The cell suspension was kept on ice until
analyzed by flow cytometry. DiOC6 and DiOC5 staining
was used to enhance erythrocyte and thrombocyte fluorescent and side scatter properties according to methods
for fish and amphibians [18] and birds [19].
PCR analyses of mutant and wild-type zebrafish kidney
hematopoietic tissues
To determine if kidney hematopoietic tissues included
functional B or T cells, NK cells or NCCs, we performed
multiple PCR reactions on cDNA generated from head
kidney tissues of mutant and wild-type zebrafish. To test
for functional B cells, we evaluated immunoglobulin
heavy chain mRNA expression using nested RT-PCR with
primers spanning the V(D)J-Cm region (Table 1 from
[16]). To test for functional T cells we utilized published
primers spanning V(D)J-Cβ (Table 1 from [16]) in nested
RT-PCR to screen mutant and wild-type zebrafish RNA for
TCR expression. To determine if the mutant and wild-type
kidney hematopoietic tissue included NK-like cells and/or
NCC cells, we designed specific primers for three forms of
NK lysin and NCCRP-1 (Table 1).

RNA was isolated from zebrafish head kidney tissue using
TRI REAGENT® (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
RNA was quantified using the NanoDrop® ND-1000 Spectrometer (NanoDrop Technologies). Prior to RT-PCR,
RNA was DNase treated using the RQ1 RNAse-Free DNase
kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI). For cDNA synthesis from total RNA, the protocol SuperScript™ III FirstStrand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, Ca) was followed using oligo (dT)20 as
primers. After verification of successful synthesis of firststrand cDNA, 5 μl of cDNA was used for PCR amplification of NK lysin form 1 (NK cell lysin 1) (accession
number NM_212741), natural killer cell lysin form 2,3
(NK cell lysin 2,3) (accession number XM690179), natural cytotoxic cell receptor protein (NCCRP-1) (accession
number NM_130921), and as positive control elongation
factor 1-alpha (EF1-α) (accession number NM_131263.1)
(Table 1). The temperature profile used was 35 cycles of
94°C for 30 sec, 58°C for 30 sec and 72 C for 1 min.
