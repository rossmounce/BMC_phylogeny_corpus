Fast evolving 18S rRNA sequences from
Solenogastres (Mollusca) resist standard PCR
amplification and give new insights into mollusk
substitution rate heterogeneity
Achim Meyer1, Christiane Todt2, Nina T Mikkelsen3, Bernhard Lieb1*

Abstract
Background: The 18S rRNA gene is one of the most important molecular markers, used in diverse applications
such as molecular phylogenetic analyses and biodiversity screening. The Mollusca is the second largest phylum
within the animal kingdom and mollusks show an outstanding high diversity in body plans and ecological
adaptations. Although an enormous amount of 18S data is available for higher mollusks, data on some early
branching lineages are still limited. Despite of some partial success in obtaining these data from Solenogastres, by
some regarded to be the most “basal” mollusks, this taxon still remained problematic due to contamination with
food organisms and general amplification difficulties.
Results: We report here the first authentic 18S genes of three Solenogastres species (Mollusca), each possessing a
unique sequence composition with regions conspicuously rich in guanine and cytosine. For these GC-rich regions
we calculated strong secondary structures. The observed high intra-molecular forces hamper standard amplification
and appear to increase formation of chimerical sequences caused by contaminating foreign DNAs from potential
prey organisms. In our analyses, contamination was avoided by using RNA as a template. Indication for
contamination of previously published Solenogastres sequences is presented. Detailed phylogenetic analyses were
conducted using RNA specific models that account for compensatory substitutions in stem regions.
Conclusions: The extreme morphological diversity of mollusks is mirrored in the molecular 18S data and shows
elevated substitution rates mainly in three higher taxa: true limpets (Patellogastropoda), Cephalopoda and
Solenogastres. Our phylogenetic tree based on 123 species, including representatives of all mollusk classes, shows
limited resolution at the class level but illustrates the pitfalls of artificial groupings formed due to shared biased
sequence composition.

Background
The small subunit (SSU) 18S rRNA gene is one of the
most frequently used genes in phylogenetic studies (see
below) and an important marker for random target PCR
in environmental biodiversity screening [1]. In general,
rRNA gene sequences are easy to access due to highly
conserved flanking regions allowing for the use of universal primers [2]. Their repetitive arrangement within
the genome provides excessive amounts of template

DNA for PCR, even in smallest organisms. The 18S
gene is part of the ribosomal functional core and is
exposed to similar selective forces in all living beings
[3]. Thus, when the first large-scale phylogenetic studies
based on 18S sequences were published - first and foremost Field et al.’s [4] phylogeny of the animal kingdom
- the gene was celebrated as the prime candidate for
reconstructing the metazoan tree of life. And in fact,
18S sequences later provided evidence for the splitting
of Ecdysozoa and Lophotrochozoa [[5], see also [6]],
thus contributing to the most recent revolutionary
change in our understanding of metazoan relationships.

from the incorporation of secondary structure into phylogenetic analyses. In particular RNA specific substitution models considering paired sites in rRNA genes
have been shown to outperform standard DNA models
[7-12].
During recent years and with increased numbers of
taxa included into molecular phylogenies, however, two
problems became apparent. First, there are prevailing
sequencing impediments in representatives of certain
taxa, such as the mollusk classes Solenogastres and Tryblidia [13,14], selected bivalve taxa (pers. comment H.
Dreyer), and the enigmatic crustacean class Remipedia
(pers. comment H. Glenner). Failure to obtain 18S
sequences of single taxa is considered a common phenomenon but is rarely ever reported. Secondly, in contrast to initially high hopes, 18S cannot resolve nodes at
all taxonomic levels and its efficacy varies considerably
among clades. This has been discussed as an effect of
rapid ancient radiation within short periods [15]. Multigene analyses are currently thought to give more reliable
results for tracing deep branching events in Metazoa but
18S still is extensively used in phylogenetic analyses.
Considering the wide range of studies based on the
18S gene as a molecular marker, both sequencing problems and the applicability of 18S for phylogenetic inferences need to be scrutinized. To address these
questions, we focus on the Mollusca, the second largest
animal phylum. There are eight higher taxa (classes)
defined within Mollusca: the aplacophoran Solenogastres
(= Neomeniomorpha) and Caudofoveata (= Chaetodermomorpha), two small clades with about 250 and 150
currently described species; Polyplacophora (ca. 920 species); and the conchiferan clades Tryblidia (= Monoplacophora; 29 species described), Scaphopoda (ca. 520
species), Cephalopoda (ca. 1,000 species), Bivalvia (ca.
30,000 species), and Gastropoda (40,000-150,000 species). The monophyly of the phylum is well established
based on morphological characters, but 18S phylogenies
often show the Mollusca as polyphyletic or paraphyletic
with low resolution of the deeper nodes [e.g: [16-19]].
One of the main deficiencies of all published studies on
mollusk phylogeny is the underrepresentation of the
minor taxa Solenogastres, Caudofoveata, and Monoplacophora. The aplacophoran Solenogastres and Caudofoveata together with Polyplacophora (chitons) are
traditionally thought to represent early branching taxa
within Mollusca, but their relative position is still controversially discussed [for review see [20,21]]. Despite of
their key position in mollusk phylogeny and evolution,
the number of molecular phylogenetic studies including
any aplacophoran mollusk species is low: Winnipeninckx et al. [22]; Okusu et al. [14]; Lindgren et al. [23];
Passamaneck et al [19]; Giribet et al. [13]; Dunn et al.
[24]; Wägele et al. [25]; Wilson et al. [26]. To date there

are no more than four caudofoveate and five solenogaster (partial) 18S sequences published in Genbank, the
taxon sampling spanning no more than two genera of
Caudofoveata and Solenogastres, respectively.
In solenogasters, Okusu and Giribet [14] described
severe contamination issues caused by cnidarian prey.
Here, we specifically address contamination issues and
point out technical problems hampering amplification
during PCR. This is important not only for prompting
representative taxonomic sampling for phylogenetic analyses, but also for avoiding under- or overestimation of
biodiversity in environmental screening programs.
Moreover, we evaluate the usefulness of the 18S gene
for phylogenetic inferences by combining our new
authentic solenogaster 18S data with published molluscan sequences and - based on an extended taxon sampling - analyze sequence divergence and compositional
heterogeneity within the phylum.

Results
Solenogastres sequences

Initial experiments using standard PCR protocols and
genomic DNA from starved specimens resulted in
sequences from prey organisms and epibionts, or in chimerical PCR products. At best, cDNA templates led to
shortened 18S sequences. Finally, authentic solenogaster
18S sequences for three species were obtained via isolation of total RNA from starved specimens, followed by
reverse transcription and utilizing additives for GC-rich
templates. 10% DMSO was applied in sequencing
reactions.
Strong secondary structures and GC clamps were
observed analyzing the Wirenia argentea (2161 bp, GC
content = 63.12%), Simrothiella margaritacea (2149 bp,
GC content = 61.42%), and Micromenia fodiens (2087
bp, GC content = 62.72%) 18S sequences. Stitch Profiles
[27] computes the temperature-dependent melting probability and location of dsDNA (helical) and ssDNA
regions and thus can be used to locate the formation of
DNA bubbles at a predefined temperature. We determined three to four helical sections in solenogaster
dsDNA (figure 1a, blue bars). These regions additionally
bear prominent stems in ssDNA, as inferred with the
secondary structure probability plot in MFold at 72°C
(Figure 1b, c). Elevated GC contents above 60% were
observed in the helical regions, with a maximum of 82%
in the second helix of S. margaritacea.
A previously published complete caudofoveate (Scutopus ventrolineatus) 18S sequence showed only one short
helical region (~100 bp, GC content 63%), which could
be aligned to the second helix of our solenogaster
sequences (figure 2). All previously published solenogaster 18S sequences lack exceptional secondary structures
and the GC contents are below 60%. The Epimenia sp.

sequences (yellow bars) match with regions of double stranded DNA forming helical regions (blue bars) in newly generated sequences.
Epimenia sp. (Ep_sp) and Helicoradomenia sp. (He_sp) sequences have been aligned to the nucleotide positions (represented by the scale bar) of
the sequences from this study, Wirenia argentea (Wi_ar) and Simrothiella margaritacea (Si_ma). The simplified schematic alignments (green bars)
show high similarity (>90%) whereas other regions (yellow bars) possess lower similarity and point to contamination issues. BLASTn searches of
yellow domains indicate high similarity with polychaetes (PI to III) or cnidarians (C), or resulted in no significant hit, indicated as Helicoradomenia
only (H). Detailed BLASTn results are given in additional file 1: Blast result table. Below the scale bar, the double stranded helical regions of 18S
sequences are indicated containing 66-82% GC islands. 1b and c: Close-up views of single stranded regions of helix 1 (1b) and helix 2 (1c) of S.

sequence includes a 46 bp fragment with 100% cnidarian sequence identity (figure 1; yellow bar, C). The two
nearly complete Helicoradomenia sp. sequences show
79.3% identity to each other. Analyses of selected sections from these sequences using BLASTn searches
showed significant identities of >95% with the polychaete Amphisamytha galapagensis and other polychaetes (See additional file 1: Blast result table). Sections
with missing data or exogenous DNA in previously published sequences match the regions of strong secondary
structures determined within the sequences of W. argentea, S. margaritacea and M. fodiens (figure 1, yellow
bars: PI, PII/H and PIII and figure 2).
Sequence composition and alignment

Among the 829 mollusk taxa sampled for 18S, the Cephalopoda, Solenogastres and Patellogastropoda (table 1)
show a combination of high GC content (>57%) and elongated gene length (>2,000 bp). The variability within the
selected taxa is measured with the disparity index (ID),
which has been shown to be more powerful than the commonly used c2 test to assess substitution patterns [28].
The compositional heterogeneity varies within the selected
mollusk taxa and is not necessarily correlated with the
sample size. For example, the disparity index within the

116 Caenogastropoda (I D = 0.01) is remarkably low
whereas Heterobranchia is highly variable (I D = 1.86).
The estimation of average Maximum Likelihood (ML)
branch lengths required the recoding of 4,315 ambiguously aligned and highly variable positions as binary presence/absence data from 5,918 overall positions. The
highest-ranking ML branch length values are found
for Cephalopoda, Solenogastres and Patellogastropoda
(table 1, column 7).
This initially analyzed large dataset also guided the
taxon selection for the phylogenetic analyses. The resulting 123 taxa prank alignment comprises 9,027 aligned
positions and 2,051 positions past trimming. The proportion of gaps or completely undetermined characters (N)
in the final alignment is 17.5%. The average disparity
indices between the groups of sequences from this alignment show Solenogastres distinct from all other mollusks
except cephalopods (ID < 1) and are depicted in the lower
triangle of table 2. Additionally, we tested the homogeneity of substitution patterns calculating all pair-wise
sequence comparisons in Mega 4.0 [29]. Significance
with a≤0.01 was tested with 1,000 Monte Carlo replicates
using the pair-wise deletion option. The substitution pattern of the three Solenogastres sequences from this
study are significantly different from all taxa except for

Phylogenetic analyses

Only the analysis using Phase 2.0 [30] with the time heterogeneous model found the Mollusca monophyletic,
albeit with low support (arrow, figure 3). We found full
support for all class level taxa except Bivalvia and confirmed all the well-established subgroups within the Gastropoda, Cephalopoda, and Scaphopoda. Polyplacophora
and the single monoplacophoran representative together
form the first branch of the molluskan tree. Within
bivalves, Palaeoheterodonta and Heterodonta form a
robustly supported clade. Pteriomorpha and Protobranchia are outside this clade. Protobranchia appears paraphyletic, with Nuculoidea representing the sister group
to Pteriomorpha and with Solemyoida included into a
clade comprising Scaphopoda, the aplacophoran clades,
and Cephalopoda. Both Bayesian and ML analyses
revealed an identical internal branching pattern of
(((Solenogastres+Cephalopoda)+Caudofoveata)+Scaphopoda). The calculated ML bootstrap support values for

composition at node one to four is very robust in all analyses (see also table 2). Inserted table: ML bootstrap support (BS) is given for the nodes
1-4 using three suggested doublet models (S6A, S7B, S16). We used two different coding schemes for unpaired sites to infer the possible
influence of base composition to the results. BS values are depicted in the order NT/RY: original nucleotide (NT) coded loops in followed by the
results providing a recoded (G, A: R; T, C: Y) loop region.

favored six state model is S6A (k: 19+9, AIC:
76557.9287). Within the seven state models S7B (k: 23+9,
AIC: 83726.0469) and within the 16 state models S16 (k:
134+9, AIC: 87394.3873) were selected. We choose the
S7B substitution model as a trade off between computational demand and complexity in the Bayesian analyses.
The Phase software is designed to infer phylogenies from
rRNA genes with paired sites and is able to model compositional heterogeneity [30]. The likelihood traces and
most of the model parameters entered the stationary
phase between 500,000 and 1,000,000 generations (Additional file 2). All five chains using the time heterogeneous
model resulted in the identical branching pattern of the
respective consensus tree and only minor differences in
branch lengths. The consensus tree was calculated from
a chain sampling 50 mio generations to maximize the
effective sample size (ESS) for all estimated parameters.
From a total of 120 model parameters, six failed to extravagate the ESS of 200, and four parameters were only
sparsely sampled (ESS < 100). To further investigate the
possible influence of exceptional sequence composition
of Solenogastres (see table 2) we modified the taxon sampling of gastropods in two analyses. (i) All Patellogastropoda and Heterobranchia in the alignment were excluded

Page 7 of 12

and replaced by three fast evolving Aeolidina (Heterobranchia). (ii) All gastropods were excluded but Patellogastropoda. Both experiments resulted in a regrouping of
the above mentioned (((Solenogastres+Cephalopoda)
+Caudofoveata)+Scaphopoda) clade placing Patellogastropoda between Scaphopoda and Caudofoveata or proposing Aeolidina as sistergroup to Solenogastres and
Cephalopoda (figure 4). All trees and alignments are
available from the authors.

Discussion
GC rich 18S and the chimera problem

Amplification problems are a frequent phenomenon,
even if using standard markers such as the 18S rRNA
gene. Secondary structures and GC-rich sections as pronounced as for the solenogaster 18S RNAs shown here,
have not been reported earlier. May GC-rich sequences
cause hampered PCR reactions in other taxa, too? Based
on our results, we assume this to be likely, but equally
startling as the failure to obtain gene sequences is the
danger to produce chimerical products.
GC-rich sequences demand higher melting temperatures
to be converted into and kept as single stranded DNA
molecules. Under standard amplification conditions,

Figure 4 ML analyses with a modified taxon sampling. A: The heterobranchs are here represented by representatives of the fast evolving
Aeolidina, only. All other taxa are identical to the sampling shown in figure 3, but we excluded also Patellogastropoda. B: Same alignment as
used in the inference for figure 3 but excluding all other gastropods except Patellogastropoda. Both analyses were conducted on ten different
starting trees with a partitioned GTR + and S16 substitution model and enabling the bootstopping criterium in RAxML (-# autoFC).

Meyer et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:70

sequence sections exclusively composed of GC residues
will terminate elongation steps in PCR by forming highly
stable stems or GC clamps causing amplification to be
refractory. Incompletely extended primers can anneal to
heterologous 18S sequences and, despite of some degree
of nucleotide mismatching, they will often be completed
in the subsequent polymerization step resulting in chimeras [33]. Alternatively, compatible priming sequences
from genes with lower GC contents are favored and successfully amplified [34]. Single stranded sequences with
pronounced GC-stem regions also may lead the Taq polymerase to skip the ‘locked’ sections, which leads to shortened PCR products lacking the stem-loop regions
[e.g.: [35]]. This potentially explains the lack of data for
the GC-rich regions in the previously published solenogaster sequences, in contrast to the Wirenia argentea, Simrothiella margaritacea, and Micromenia fodiens sequences
described herein. This interpretation is corroborated by
the severe amplification problems we experienced when
using recombinant plasmids as templates under standard
PCR conditions (denaturing step at 94°C). The cloned
Wirenia argentea 18S inserts could not be amplified using
conventional PCR protocols but resulted in blank agarose
gels (not documented), although the number of templates
accessible from clone amplification usually exceeds the
gene copy number of genomic DNA extractions by far.
Failure to amplify solenogaster 18S under such conditions
demonstrates that clean starting material is just the first
step. In addition to ours, a number of protocols for difficult or GC rich templates are published [36,37], supplemented by several commercial kits.
Contamination

The solenogaster midgut is extremely voluminous and
can hold undigested food that may provide considerable
amounts of DNA templates leading to non-target or chimerical amplification products (see above). To avoid contamination with prey organisms, Okusu and Giribet [14]
suggested the use of gonad tissue, larval material or of
species that are not predators of metazoan organisms.
The first two options are feasible where material is available, but the third option can be misleading when the
diet is unknown. A prey-predator relationship between
Helicoradomenia and non-cnidarian metazoan organisms, probably polychaetes, has been proposed earlier
based on transmission electron microscopy data [38].
Starving animals in the laboratory for several days can
reduce the amount of contaminating prey tissue considerably [39], but exogenous DNA was amplified even after
starvation times of up to three months when using standard PCR protocols. This may be due to residues of prey
cnidocysts held back in the midgut epithelial cells. Thus,
we found isolation of total RNA from starved specimens,
followed by reverse transcription, to be most effective to

Page 8 of 12

avoid contamination. Isolation of total RNA followed by
DNase digestion makes up to 95% of rRNA available for
RT-PCR and destroys contaminating non-target DNA
templates. Due to the ubiquitous presence of RNases
causing instability of RNA outside of living cells, the presence of considerable amounts of exogenous RNA within
an isolate is highly unusual, but one always has to bear in
mind the possibility of contamination with parasites, epibionts, and undigested prey tissue.
Phylogenetic inferences

Considering the pitfalls of phylogenetic analyses based on
a single gene and taking into account well-established
knowledge on mollusk relationships, a number of groupings in our tree are ambiguous. This concerns for example
the clade composed of Cephalopoda and Solenogastres,
where molecular inferences may reflect a shared bias in
base composition rather than a sistergroup relationship.
This assumption is corroborated by the two experiments
testing the influence of taxon sampling by manipulating
the gastropod dataset (figure 4). In Patellogastropoda and
Heterobranchia there are species with substitution patterns similar to Solenogastres (table 2). For both taxa, the
exclusion of species breaking up their long branches
resulted in a placement next to species with a similar
sequence composition. The branching pattern including
all major gastropod lineages is robust in all analyses both
within the Gastropoda and the clade (((Solenogastres
+Cephalopoda)+Caudofoveata)+Scaphopoda). When we
add the heterobranch taxa from the original analysis to the
three extremely fast evolving Aeolidina, the latter taxon is
correctly placed inside the heterobranch radiation (data
not shown). Within Solenogastres our species selection
aimed to reflect the taxon diversity by selecting representatives from two different orders (three families), but
the trimming of the alignment adapted to the broad
taxon sampling diminished the phylogenetic signal at
the species level.
Our new and more representative dataset of 123 taxa
covered for the first time all mollusk classes, but our
analyses across the Mollusca resulted in short internal
branches combined with single long branching clades.
This scenario is known to be critical in phylogenetic
tree reconstructions [40]. The structure aware and nonstationary models greatly improved the results by detecting “problematic” taxa and by resulting in increased
node support for well established subgroups. Thus we
were able to recover nearly all mollusk classes, even
though problematic fast evolving taxa, such as Patellogastropoda, were included. In rejecting the major mollusk clade Conchifera (mollusks with a single or
bivalved shell), however, our phylogenetic tree does not
reflect traditional views. We detected a sister group of
Polyplacophora and Monoplacophora as proposed by

Meyer et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:70
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/70

Giribet et al. [13] and Wilson et al. [26], but not with
full support. Both taxa show only minor differences in
sequence composition (table 2), which might mislead
analyses of class level relationships.
The failure to detect monophyletic Bivalvia probably
best demonstrates the limits of 18S analyses in Mollusca
using contemporary methods [see also [19,22,41]]. Bivalvia are known to show a number of exceptional morphological characters as well as several unusual
structural features in the mitochondrial genome [42].
Thus, despite not obviously fast evolving, here the alignment methods may have failed to identify homologous
positions correctly. Alternatively, the phylogenetic signal
in bivalves may be largely eroded. The close relationship
between Scaphopoda and Protobranchia is worth mentioning because it (partly) supports the so-called Diasoma hypothesis, recently rejected by a number of
molecular and morphological analyses, but here again
proposing a sistergroup relationship between Bivalvia
and Scaphopoda [43],
Across all analyses we recovered a previously proposed clade composed of Cycliophora and Kamptozoa
within the outgroup [44-47].
Sequence divergence in Mollusca

Elevated substitution rates are known to be gene specific
but also characteristic for certain lineages across different genes [48,49]. High substitution rates in the generally well-conserved 18S gene thus may point to fast
evolving taxa. To allow for general conclusions across
the Mollusca, we inferred substitution rates for all published molluscan 18S sequences longer than 1600 bp.
The solenogaster 18S sequences obtained in this study
are among the fastest evolving 18S sequences within the
Mollusca. Solenogastres bear a number of assumed
ancestral mollusk features, but substitution rates in the
18S gene are nearly doubled in our selected species
compared to other presumably “basal” mollusks, such as
Caudofoveata and Polyplacophora. If the assumed plesiomorphic morphological characters in Solenogastres
are in fact conserved ancestral features, then molecular
and morphological rates of evolution are unlinked, at
least for the 18S gene. Similar cases of possibly ancestral
morphology combined with exceptionally high substitution rates as shown in table 1 are Nautilus, the “living
fossil” cephalopods, and Patellogastropoda, the true limpets [50,51]. A number of factors, for example functionality of proteins and RNAs, generation time, metabolic
rate, population size, and life histories, are thought to
influence substitution rates [52,53].

Conclusions
We show that the solenogaster 18S gene has an exceptional base composition, resulting in a number of

Page 9 of 12

technical difficulties. Amplification problems are a common phenomenon but can be overcome by combining
known methods in a new framework and by employing
alternative strategies. We suggest to include assays with
modified PCR methods and to creatively vary PCR conditions if amplification fails or if it leads to ‘peculiar’
results [see also [54]].
We show that the practical amplification issues of 18S
are conquerable, whereas the future of mollusk class
level phylogeny appears not to lie in this gene. The
incorporation of additional data, such as structural
information to identify homologous positions between
sequences, is a promising approach to improve alignments and phylogenetic analyses. Within the Mollusca,
where the sequence composition is highly variable
between clades, both alignment methods and models of
evolution used in phylogenetic analyses at date still
remain the main bottlenecks in tracing deep phylogeny.
Thus, multigene analyses are more effective to resolve
such ancient splits, as recently demonstrated [55].

Methods
Animals and PCR conditions

All Solenogastres specimens were collected off Bergen,
Norway and starved up to three months at 4°C in natural
seawater. RNA was extracted from six to twenty animals
of each species using Trizol (Invitrogen, Germany) and
followed by DNase digestion on NucleoSpin II columns
(Macherey-Nagel, Germany). RT was performed for 45
min at 55°C using 100 ng of RNA as template. Either random or the gene specific R1843 primer [56] were applied
using Superscript III (Invitrogen, Germany) or BcaBEST™
RNA PCR Kit Ver. 1.1 (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Japan). The
GC-rich PCR system (Roche) was used to amplify cDNA
adding the supplied GC-rich resolution solution to a final
concentration of 0.5 M. Three non overlapping fragments
were amplified in all species. The thermal profile for
the primers 500F (5’GCGGCGCGACGATCGAAATGAGTCGG3’) and 2000R (5’GCCTTATCCCGAGCACGCGCGGGGTTCG3’), annealing at 58°C was setup
as time incremental PCR with 1’35” + 5"/cycle at 72°C for
25 times, and a final elongation at 68°C for 7’. The two
smaller, neighboring 18S regions were annealed at 53°C
[primer F19 [57] and 500R (5’CCGACTCATTTCGATCGTCGCGCCGC3’)] or 56°C [primer 2000F
(5’CGAACCCCGCGCGTGCTCGG3’)/R1843 [56]]. All
PCR products were excised from 0.8% TAE agarose gels
and isolated using the Agarose-Out kit (EURx, Poland).
All large central 18S PCR fragments (500F/2000R) were
cloned using the TOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen, Germany) and electrocompetent cells DH10B pulsed at
1800 V. Recombinant plasmids from over night
grown liquid cultures (1.5 ml) were isolated using the
GeneMatrix Miniprep purification kit (EURx, Poland).

Meyer et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:70
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/70

Sequencing was performed using a M13 primer, gene
specific primer or Wiar900F (CCGCGGCCGCCTCG)
and R427 [58]. Cycle sequencing was done applying the
Taq Dye Terminator system (Big Dye 3.1, Applied Biosystems) including 10% DMSO in each reaction. All
sequences were submitted to Genbank: Wirenia argentea
FJ649599, Simrothiella margaritacea FJ649600 and
Micromenia fodiens FJ649601.
Sequence conformation (figures 1 and 2)

Melting curves of double stranded DNA products were
analyzed with Stitch Profiles [27]. We determined the critical temperature to melt half of the DNA (helicity = 0.5)
in Wirenia argentea and than applied 90.7° using the
Blossey and Carlon [59] parameter set. The profiles were
aligned to the public available sequences for Epimenia
babai (AY212107, AY212106), Epimenia sp. (AY377657)
and Helicoramenia sp. (AY145377, AY212108). Secondary structures were calculated at 72°C and 65°C with
MFold [60] at the Institut Pasteur webserver http://bioweb2.pasteur.fr.
Sequence composition (table 1)

18S data (>1.6 kb) from 834 mollusks and 40 non-mollusk outgroup species including all sequence data available for Sipunculida (11 species) and Kamptozoa
(5 species) were collected from GenBank and aligned
using Mafft version 6.7 [61,62] in the E-INS-i mode. GC
content, gene length, base composition distance and the
disparity index were calculated from this alignment
using Mega version 4.0 [29]. The secondary structure
from Mimachlamys varia L49051 was extracted from
the European Ribosomal Database and used to fit a consensus secondary structure on the alignment using
RNA-Salsa [63] in combination with the Alicut perl
script http://zfmk.de/web/Forschung/Abteilungen/
AG_Wgele/Software/Utilities/index.en.html. Ambiguously aligned hypervariable loop regions within the 870
taxa alignment were identified by eye and coded as binary absence (gap) and present (any base) data [64]
before fed into RAxML version 7.2.2 [65]. The S16
model was used for paired sites, the GTR + Γ for non
paired sites and the two states BIN model for ambiguously aligned regions. The resulting ML tree was used
to infer the branchlengths from each species tip to the
most basal node (last common ancestor of Priapulus
caudatus and all remaining lophotrochozoans) using the
tool Branchlength at the HIV database http://www.hiv.
lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIV/HIVTools.html.
Alignment and phylogenetic inferences

The species chosen for phylogenetic inferences aimed to
represent the molecular diversity observed in the 870
taxa alignment. If possible, short branching species were

Page 10 of 12

preferred. An alignment of 123 species was completed
using Mafft (see above) and subsequently trimmed using
Aliscore [66]. A guide tree was constructed from this
alignment in RAxML 7.2.2 using the GTR + Γ model
and a constrain tree for the molluscan classes. The
resulting ML tree was used as guide tree in Prank+F [67]
with two subsequent alignment steps using the flags
-once, -realbranches and maxbranches = 0.15 respectively. A consensus secondary structure was provided as
described in the previous section. The same alignment
procedure was repeated for a second alignment including three Aeolidina (Heterobranchia). The final alignment was edited by eye and trimmed using a python
script (available from the authors) in combination with
Alicut to discard columns with a threshold of 90% missing data while maintaining a valid secondary structure
file. Prank is very conservative in detecting homologous
positions and thus this relatively low cut off already provides dense high quality alignments. The trimmed 123
taxa alignment was used to calculate the disparity index
and to test the substitution pattern with 1,000 Monte
Carlo replicates as implemented in Mega 4.0.
ML trees for all 14 doublet models implemented in
RAxML were calculated to select the best fitting substitution model from the 6-, 7-, and 16-state category of
models, respectively, applying the AIC as described in
Tsagkogeorga et al. [9]. For each of these models we
conducted 200 inferences on the original alignment to
search for the best ML tree and 1,000 bootstrap replicates enabling the bootstopping option for the frequencies based criterion [68]. The inferences were repeated
with RY (G, A = R; C, T = Y) coded loop regions. The
wRF distance between the three ML trees was calculated
using RAxML 7.2.2.
Phase version 2.0 http://www.bioinf.manchester.ac.uk/
resources/phase/ was used for the bayesian inference. The
burnin for each setting was determined conducting fully
sampled 3,000,000 generation pre-runs (burnin = 0). We
adapted the settings from the example control file tol40.
mcmc according our dataset in changing the models to
GTR + Γ6 and S7B + Γ6 with the proposal priorities for
model 1 to = 7 and model 2 to = 24. All chains sampled
10,000,000 generations, discarding 2,000,000 generations
as burnin. File conversion was performed using phase2tracer.pl http://hymenoptera.tamu.edu/rna/download.php.
The best model found was optimized using the phase tool
Optimizer to generate a model block with fixed substitution rates for a time heterogeneous run. The time-heterogeneous run estimated the base frequencies separately for
three independent (GTR + Γ 6, S7B + Γ6 ) models. Four
chains run analogous as described for the mixed model
above and additionally a fifth chain sampled 50,000,000
generations, discarding 10,000,000 generations, to
determine the consensus tree and Bayesian posterior
