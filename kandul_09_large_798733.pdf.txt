Abstract
Background: Alternative splicing (AS) of maturing mRNA can generate structurally and
functionally distinct transcripts from the same gene. Recent bioinformatic analyses of available
genome databases inferred a positive correlation between intron length and AS. To study the
interplay between intron length and AS empirically and in more detail, we analyzed the diversity of
alternatively spliced transcripts (ASTs) in the Drosophila RNA-binding Bruno-3 (Bru-3) gene. This
gene was known to encode thirteen exons separated by introns of diverse sizes, ranging from 71
to 41,973 nucleotides in D. melanogaster. Although Bru-3's structure is expected to be conducive to
AS, only two ASTs of this gene were previously described.
Results: Cloning of RT-PCR products of the entire ORF from four species representing three
diverged Drosophila lineages provided an evolutionary perspective, high sensitivity, and long-range
contiguity of splice choices currently unattainable by high-throughput methods. Consequently, we
identified three new exons, a new exon fragment and thirty-three previously unknown ASTs of Bru3. All exon-skipping events in the gene were mapped to the exons surrounded by introns of at least
800 nucleotides, whereas exons split by introns of less than 250 nucleotides were always spliced
contiguously in mRNA. Cases of exon loss and creation during Bru-3 evolution in Drosophila were
also localized within large introns. Notably, we identified a true de novo exon gain: exon 8 was
created along the lineage of the obscura group from intronic sequence between cryptic splice sites
conserved among all Drosophila species surveyed. Exon 8 was included in mature mRNA by the
species representing all the major branches of the obscura group. To our knowledge, the origin of
exon 8 is the first documented case of exonization of intronic sequence outside vertebrates.
Conclusion: We found that large introns can promote AS via exon-skipping and exon turnover
during evolution likely due to frequent errors in their removal from maturing mRNA. Large introns
could be a reservoir of genetic diversity, because they have a greater number of mutable sites than
short introns. Taken together, gene structure can constrain and/or promote gene evolution.

Background
Alternative splicing (AS) and other post-transcriptional
modifications of the same pre-mRNA generate structurally
and functionally distinct transcripts from the same gene
and thus could account for the origin of high protein
diversity from the limited number of coding genes (e.g.,
[1-4]). The genome of Drosophila melanogaster [5] contains
15,182 annotated genes (Release 5.2 [6]) that encode
43,129 distinct transcripts (UniGene build #64 [7]).
Therefore, on average, one Drosophila gene encodes 2.8
known or predicted transcripts. The ratio of genes to transcripts is even higher in humans, 1:9.5; 20,500 genomic
genes [8] and 195,727 distinct transcripts (UniGene build
#219 [7]).
The complex molecular structure of genes might be especially conducive to AS. In particular, exon number and
intron length correlate with AS [e.g., [9-12]]. Genes with
greater numbers of exons can generate more alternatively
spliced transcripts (ASTs) just by possible combinations
of a gene's exons [e.g., [10]]. One of the most extreme
examples of Drosophila multi-exonic genes is Dscam. This
gene potentially encodes 38,016 distinct axon guidance
receptors via differential inclusion of its 95 exons [13].
Multiple recent bioinformatics analyses of genome databases inferred that exons surrounded by long introns (i.e.,
>250 bp) are skipped more often in gene transcripts than
exons flanked by short introns [11,12,14,15]. In addition,
recursive splicing of extremely large introns [16,17] may
be prone to errors, which may lead to both exon-skipping
and intron retention in transcripts. Therefore, the presence of many exons separated by long introns in a gene
can promote, or at least associate with, the AS of a gene.
We studied the potential interplay between the intron
length and AS using the Drosophila Bruno-3 (Bru-3). This
gene has a genetic structure unusual for Drosophila. While
the average Drosophila genes tend to have 4 exons and 487
bp-long introns [18], Bru-3 is encoded by 13 exons that
spread along 129 kb of genomic sequence and its longest
known mature mRNA is only 2.6 kb long. The lengths of
the twelve introns in this gene are extremely diverse and
range from 71 bp up to 41,973 bp (FlyBase.org, D. melanogaster release 5.13). Therefore, the inclusion frequency
of exons surrounded by differently sized introns can be
examined within this single gene. Only two alternatively
spliced transcripts (ASTs) of Bru-3 - Bru-3-RA (2606 bp)
and Bru-3-RB (2429 bp) - were identified and confirmed
in D. melanogaster (UniGene Dm.13624). One additional
alternative transcript can be inferred from 17 ESTs available at UniGene Database [7] that match the Bru-3
genomic sequence. However, this gene might have a
greater diversity of ASTs than previously documented. By
focusing our analysis to a single interesting gene, we
sought to more thoroughly sample AST diversity directly
and study the interplay between intron length and AS.

Drosophila Bru-3 belongs to a complex and diverse group
of RNA binding proteins [e.g., [19]]. It encodes two RNA
recognition motifs (RRMs), one at the N-terminus and
one at the C-terminus of the gene, and a linker region
between the RRMs [20,21]. Bru-3 was classified as the Drosophila orthologue of human and mouse CUG-BP (also
called as TNRC4) and Xenopus EDEN-BP [i.e., Bluno-like
proteins, [20,22]]. While it was shown that Bru-3 represses
the translation of target genes by binding to the 3' UTR of
their mRNA in Drosophila, [e.g., [20]], it may also regulate
pre-mRNA AS and be involved in mRNA editing, as done
by other members of this protein family [e.g., [19,23,24]].
The importance of these regulatory functions of Bru-3 is
likely reflected in high sequence conservation at both coding and non-coding regions of this gene [but see also,
[25]]. Bru-3 has the highest number of ultra-conserved
elements per gene between D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura, separated 55 million years (MY) ago [26]. These
elements comprise 11.2 kb [27], while the longest mature
mRNA of D. melanogaster Bru-3 is only 2.6 kb (FlyBase.org, release 5.13).
Common computational methods rely on expression
sequence tags [EST, [28]] to infer ASTs. As a result, inherent biases of EST recovery [for more detail refer to:
[3,14,29,30]] lead to underestimation of the true number
of alternatively spliced genes and especially the diversity
of alternative transcripts of individual genes [e.g.,
[31,32]]. Direct bioinformatic identification of alternative
splicing events, including cassette exons, alternative 5' and
3' splice sites, is still not totally accurate and comprehensive [31,32]. Application of microarrays for probing the
diversity of alternative transcripts requires knowing the
locations of exon-exon and exon-intron junctions
[29,33]. In addition, hybridization-based methods tend
to have low sensitivity and specificity [30,34,35]. Finally,
the above methods rely on short sequences (i.e., perhaps
500-800 bp maximum) to infer particular exon combinations, and long-range contiguity of splice choices along a
maturing mRNA cannot be extracted from these data.
Therefore, detailed study of candidate genes using classic
molecular methods, like RT-PCR of an entire transcript, is
the method of choice when the entire diversity of alternative transcripts is investigated.
Here, the diversity of Bru-3 ASTs was analyzed via RT-PCR
in four Drosophila species - D. melanogaster, D. persimilis,
D. pseudoobscura and D. virilis. These species represent
three distantly related Drosophila groups that were separated by 55 million years of independent evolution [26].
Thus the evolutionary conservation of ASTs of Bru-3 along
such divergence would suggest their functional significance [e.g., [36]]. We also studied the molecular evolution
of the translated part of Bru-3, including patterns of exon
gains and losses, using the published genome sequences
of twelve Drosophila species [37]. Roy et al. [15] found that

long introns were enriched with newly created exons compared to short introns. Our data presented an exciting
opportunity to analyze the patterns of exon gains and
losses in regards to intron lengths. Finally, we tested the
effect of splicing constraint (i.e., constitutive versus alternative splicing) on the evolution of homologous RRM
domains in Bru-3 among twelve different species.

for D. persimilis (Additional file 2, GenBank: GQ497397GQ497445). In addition, a few new exon combinations
that represent new ASTs were inferred using primers
bound to specific exons, and further increased the number
of ASTs found in each Drosophila species (Additional file
2). Altogether, 35 distinct ASTs of Bru-3 have been identified across four Drosophila species (Table 1).

Results

Multiple splicing events - exon skipping, alternative start
codons, and alternative 3' splice sites (SS) - contributed to
the diversity of transcripts of this gene. Although the
diversity of ASTs of Bru-3 is likely underestimated for species other than D. pseudoobscura, the evolutionary conservation of individual splicing events and multiple ASTs
along tens of MY of evolution is obvious (Table 1 and Figure 1A). Nine ASTs and two specific exon combinations exons 3, 4, 5 and exons 5, 6, 7 - have been conserved in at
least two distantly related Drosophila species, separated by
55 MY [transcripts with stars in Table 1, [26]]. For example, one distinct transcript that contained 'nonsense' exon
4a was identified in D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura
(Table 1: transcript 29). The same two alternative 5' SS in
exons 4 and 13 were used in D. pseudoobscura and D. melanogaster, and thus 18 bp-long truncations at the 5'-ends
of these exons may be functionally significant in both species. The latter 5' SS is also used by D. virilis. While the
alternative 5' SS in exon 10 appears to be an apomorphy
of the melanogaster group (see below), the sequence at the
alternative 5' SS in exon 11 is conserved among the twelve
Drosophila species [37] and may be used as a SS in other
Drosophila species (Figure 1A). Overall, many ASTs as well
as specific splicing events of Bru-3 are conserved between
distantly related Drosophila species.

Molecular structure and AS of Bru-3 in Drosophila species
The structure of Bru-3
The highest number of exons in Bru-3 was found in D.
pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. A total of sixteen exons
encode Bru-3 in these species (Figure 1A and Additional
file 1). Of these, thirteen exons encode parts of the open
reading frame. The remaining three exons either entirely
form UTRs (i.e., exons 1 and 15) or are only occasionally
retained in the mature mRNA and do not have a consistent, long ORF (i.e., 'nonsense' exon 4a in Figure 1A). Single PCR products were amplified from the 5'- and 3'-end
UTRs of Bru-3 in D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis, and
thus the exons encoding the UTRs - exons 1, 2, 14 and 15
- were constitutively spliced in both species. Only single
synonymous substitutions in the ORF and a few short
insertions/deletions and substitutions in the 5'- and 3'end UTRs distinguish both D. pseudoobscura isolates and
D. persimilis MSH93. We identified a single nucleotide
insertion in the published genomic sequence of D. persimilis at exon 10, which introduces two premature termination codons (PTCs) and thus was likely a sequencing or
assembly mistake (scaffold 36 at position 405678, initial
assembly; Flybase.org). The longest ORF of 1281 nucleotides was identified in D. pseudoobscura, transcript #1 in
Table 1. Still, exon 3 was skipped in this transcript, and
thus the longest potential ORF of Bru-3 in D. pseudoobscura
and D. persimilis is 1323 nucleotides. The shortest ORF
was identified in D. persimilis and D. melanogaster, and was
only 414 nucleotides (transcript 33 in Table 1). Four
translated exons were included in the ORF of this transcript, exons 2, 4, 13 and 14. Only two exons from the
ORF of Bru-3 (13 and 14) were constitutively spliced and
translated in all tested species (Table 1). The other exons
of the ORF were skipped in at least one AST and thus were
alternatively spliced exons sensu stricto.
Complex AS of Bru-3
Multiple ASTs of Bru-3 are expressed in adult flies of D.
melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura, D. persimilis and D. virilis.
We identified 22 distinct ASTs from the alignment of 49
sequenced clones of the entire ORF from D. pseudoobscura
female and male flies [GenBank: GQ497346-GQ497396].
A smaller number of clones were sequenced for the other
Drosophila species, and thus fewer distinct ASTs of Bru-3
were found for these species. 15 different ASTs were sampled for D. melanogaster, 8 ASTs for D. virilis, and 6 ASTs

A few mature mRNA included 'nonsense' exon 4a
Six clones of the entire ORF of Bru-3 from D. pseudoobscura
and D. persimilis included an additional sequence, called
here 'nonsense' exon 4a. These clones were derived from
four independent cDNA pools of both D. pseudoobscura
isolates and D. persimilis MSH93, and represent distinct
ASTs (transcripts 10, 18, 22, and 29 in Table 1). The inclusion of exon 4a into transcripts introduced multiple PTCs
and thus possibly rendered them non-functional for protein translation (aka 'nonsense'). The sequence of exon 4a
is highly conserved between D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. Only two insertion/deletions of a single nucleotide
and 5 substitutions out of 454 nucleotides distinguish
both species. Exon 4a derives from the longest intron in
Bru-3 - 40,652 bp - between exons 4 and 5; 6,664 nucleotides upstream of exon 5 in D. pseudoobscura (r2.3, FlyBase.org). Interestingly, the sequences that appeared
homologous to 'nonsense' exon 4a in D. pseudoobscura
were also identified in two ASTs of D. melanogaster (transcripts 29 and 34 in Table 1). D. melanogaster exon 4a had
the same length, introduced PTCs, and originated from

Alternatively spliced transcripts (AST) were analyzed in four different species of Drosophila: D. pseudoobscura (pse), D. persimilis (per), D. melanogaster
(mel) and D. virilis (vir). The total number of sequenced transcripts is shown in brackets for each species. Two known ASTs of D. melanogaster
(FlyBase.org) labeled with letters - A and B - are also included in the table. D. melanogaster exon 10 was longer by 3 nucleotides than the same exon
in the other species. Thus, two sizes separated by a slash are presented for the ASTs shared between both species. Although we have not
sequenced the entire ASTs 2 and 35, the splice choices specific for these ASTs were sampled for species designated by "X".

Intron length and alternative splicing of Bru-3 in distantly related Drosophila species. (A) Splice choices identified in
D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura, D. persimilis and D. virilis. Only lengths of exons (boxes), but not introns (lines connecting
exons), are drawn to scale. The ORF is shaded. The untranslated regions (UTRs) of Bru-3 were not analyzed in D. virilis. For
simplicity, exon skipping and alternative acceptor sites, but not intron splicing per se, are depicted. While many splice choices in
Bru-3 were found conserved between tested species, the gene underwent evolution at the exon level. Exon 8 were created de
nove from intronic sequence in D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis sibling species pair, and exon 6 lost coding potential in D. melanogaster. (B) The gene structure of Bru-3 in D. pseudoobscura. All exons and the introns that are shorter than 2 kb are drawn
to scale. The lengths of the other introns are presented. (C) The intron length and splicing of adjacent exons in Bru-3. The column heights are proportional to the natural logarithm of intron lengths in D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura and D. virilis. The
columns are aligned between corresponding exons. The circles enclose the number of exons that included into the majority of
ASTs. The horizontal line depicts the suggested cut-off, 250 nucleotides, between short- and long- introns [12,54]. The shorter
introns are likely spliced out through the intron definition mechanism whereas the longer introns relay on the exon definition
mechanism for their splicing [12]. The intron definition mechanism of splicing was shown to be more precise and efficient than
the exon definition mechanism [12]. We found that the exons adjacent to long-introns were frequently skipped in ASTs of Bru3, whereas the exons connected by short-introns - exons 9, 10 and 11, and exons 13 and 14 (black bars) - were always spliced
together.

ally from maturing mRNAs to re-establish their proteinencoding potential.
Alternative start codon of Bru-3
We inferred an alternative start codon for Bru-3 located in
exon 7. Exons 2 and 7 were spliced to each other in D. melanogaster transcript 31 (Table 1). Although skipping exon
4 offset the reading frame starting from exon 2, the alternative start codon located at the 3'-end of exon 7 could be
used in transcript 31. The resulted polypeptide chain
would skip the entire N-terminal RRM, but it would
include the other functionally important domains of Bru3, like the linker region and C-terminal RRM [20]. Therefore, transcript 31 may be a valid, albeit rare, transcript
encoding a functional protein in D. melanogaster.
Exon 6 can be spliced in the middle of the N-terminal RRM
Each Bru-3 RRM is formed by two exons. Exons 5 and 7
together make the N-terminal RRM. We identified exon 6
in D. pseudoobscura that was located between these functionally linked exons in the genomic sequence and was
spliced together with exon 7 (Table 1). However, none of
the sequenced clones of Bru-3 had exon 6 retained
between exons 5 and 7. To test whether the constraints
acting on the functional domain would prevent the production of Bru-3 transcripts with exon 6 disrupting the
RRM, we screened cDNA pools from D. pseudoobscura, and
D. persimilis for transcripts with consecutive exons 5, 6 and
7. Amplicons with exons 5, 6 and 7, as well as exons 5 and
6 spliced together were found in both species (Additional
file 3). Because exon 6 does not have a 3' SS, once retained
between exon 5 and 7, it cannot not be spliced out by
itself.
Intron size and AS in Bru-3
In the translated segment of Bru-3, exons separated by
large introns were skipped more often than exons divided
by small introns, less than 250 nucleotides. Furthermore,
the consecutive exons that were always spliced together in
ASTs were divided by three shortest introns in the gene all less that 160 bp (Figure 1B, C) in the tested Drosophila
species. The two shortest introns - introns 9 and 10 divide exons 9, 10 and 11. These exons were always
spliced together: if any of these three exons was included
in the transcript the others were also included (Table 1).
The third shortest intron - intron 13 - divides exons 13
and 14 (Figure 1B). These exons were included in every
ASTs of Bru-3 identified in four Drosophila species (Table
1). The next shortest intron separating the translated
exons in Bru-3 - intron 11 - was already unusually large for
Drosophila (Figure 35 in [18]): 847 bp in D. melanogaster,
and 1024 bp in D. pseudoobscura. Less than 9% of all D.
melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura introns have the same
or longer sizes, and 86 and 69 nucleotides are the median
intron sizes is both species, respectively. Intron 11 divides

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/67

exon 12 from the group of contiguously spliced exons 9,
10 and 11 (Figure 1B). Perhaps not surprisingly, exon 12
was skipped in more that half of the transcripts that
included exons 9, 10 and 11 (Table 1). The 5'-end part of
Bru-3 ORF - exons from 2 through 9 - has larger introns
that the 3'-end part of ORF, and overall the higher number
of AS events were identified in the 5'-end part of the ORF
(Table 1). Nevertheless, exons 4 and 7, each located adjacent to large introns, were faithfully included into almost
all surveyed transcripts, precluding statistically significance in a simple association between intron size and
exon skipping.
Evolution of Bru-3 in Drosophila
Exon turnover during Bru-3 evolution
Two previously unknown exons (6 and 8) of Bru-3 were
identified in D. pseudoobscura. These exons encode short
polypeptide chains in Bru-3 protein - 17 and 19 amino
acids, respectively. No previously sampled ASTs from Drosophila species other than D. pseudoobscura included either
of these exons (Table 1). However, we confirmed via RTPCR that both exons are included in mature mRNA of D.
persimilis, and exon 6 is included in mature mRNA of D.
virilis (Figure 2A, B and Additional file 2). The location of
each exon in the twelve published genomes of Drosophila
species is indicated in Additional file 1. We have not
found sequences homologous to exon 6 in species of the
melanogaster group whose genomes were sequenced [37].
Likewise, the sequences homologous to exon 8 could not
be found in Drosophila species other than D. pseudoobscura
and D. persimilis. When we mapped the presence of exons
6 and 8 onto the phylogeny of twelve Drosophila species,
we found that exon 6 was lost along the branch leading to
the melanogaster group, while exon 7 appeared to be an
apomorphy of the obscura group (Figure 3).

The proposed cases of exon loss and gain are not simple
mistakes of genome assembly. We sequenced the genomic
regions homologous by their positions to the regions that
encompass exons 6 and 8 in D. pseudoobscura for D. simulans, D. melanogaster, D. erecta, D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura, D. persimilis, D. mojavensis and D. virilis, and
compared to their genomic counterparts. We have not
found any mistakes of genome assembly that could
explain the exon loss and gain in Bru-3, and thus the exon
turnover is genuine. Screening of cDNA pools from D.
melanogaster, D. erecta, D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura, D.
willistoni, D. mojavensis, and D. virilis for the presence of
exons 6 and 8 further supported our conclusion. Exon 6
was identified in cDNA pools from D. pseudoobscura, D.
mojavensis, and D. virilis, whereas exon 8 was found only
in D. pseudoobscura cDNA pool (Figure 2A, B).
To investigate focal changes that could lead to the loss and
gain of respective exons, we aligned the sequenced frag-

ments encompassing exons 6 and 8 in D. simulans, D. melanogaster, D. erecta, D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura, D.
persimilis, D. willistoni, D. mojavensis and D. virilis (Additional files 4 and 5). Sequences clearly homologous to
exon 6 were found in D. willistoni, D. mojavensis, and D.
virilis. These sequences were conserved at both the amino
acid and nucleotide levels. In contrast, although the tested
species from the melanogaster group had the conserved 3'
SS of the intron upstream of exon 6, the sequences homologous by position to exon 6 were not conserved in these
species (Additional file 4). The region corresponding to
exon 6 had an in-frame PTC in D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. ananassae. In addition, D. ananassae had an
insertion in this region. Therefore, the local deletions/
insertions and/or substitutions at the 5' SS flaking exon 6
likely led to the loss of coding potential and subsequent
decay of exon 6 in the melanogaster lineage (Figure 3).
Higher sequence conservation was detected in the
genomic fragments encompassing exon 8. The location of
two 30 nucleotide-long ultraconserved regions near 5' SS
facilitated the alignment of these fragments. Although all
tested Drosophila species shared both 3' and 5' SSs flanking
exon 8, the region corresponding to exon 8 in D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis was not conserved at either amino

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/67

acid or nucleotide levels in the other tested species (Additional file 5). We also found that D. simulans, D. melanogaster, D. ananassae, D. mojavensis and D. virilis all had
at least one in-frame PTC, while D. willistoni had a 47
nucleotides-long insertion at the region corresponding to
exon 8. Therefore, this region does not encode a polypeptide chain in any tested species except D. pseudoobscura
and D. persimilis, and the ORF of exon 8 was likely created
in situ from intron sequence in the obscura group.
Exon 8 originated early in the evolution of the obscura group
To study the origin of exon 8 in further detail, the genomic
fragments encompassing exon 8 were sequenced for the
species representing all major lineages in the obscura
group [e.g., [39,40]]. All tested species from this group - D.
pseudoobscura bogotana, D. miranda, D. obscura, D. bifasciata, D. subobscura and D. affinis - possessed the conserved
exon 8. The last four of the above species each had one
non-synonymous substitution in the 3'-end of exon 8 and
a few substitutions at 3' and 5' SS around this exon (Additional file 6). To test whether these substitutions at the 3'
and 5' SS could affect the inclusion of exon 8 into Bru-3
mRNA, we screened cDNA pools of D. pseudoobscura and
D. persimilis, D. obscura, D. bifasciata, D. subobscura and D.

in D. melanogaster (mel) and D. virilis (vir).

277 nucleotides, FlyBase.org: r5.13). We analyzed the origin of the alternative 3' SS of exon 10 using the published
genomes of Drosophila species [37]. While all twelve Drosophila species share the common 3' SS upstream of exon
10, an additional 3' SS was created along the lineage leading to the melanogaster group (Figure 3). The splicing at
this new 3' SS would add 30 bp to D. erecta exon 10, 18
bp to D. ananassae exon 10, and 24 bp to exon 10 in the
other four species in the melanogaster group (Additional
file 7). While no potential 3' SS could be inferred in the
homologous intron for D. grimshawi, D, mojavensis, D. virilis, and D. willistoni, three such sites were identified
upstream of exon 10 in D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis.
However, we doubt that these additional 3' SS are active
in both species. The minimum intron length required for
successful splicing is around 45 nucleotides in Drosophila
species [e.g., [41,42]], whereas these 3' SS upstream of
exon 10 were only 15, 21, and 27 nucleotides apart from
the 5' SS downstream of exon 9, and exons 9 and 10 were
always spliced together (Tables 1). Therefore, the alternative 3' SS in exon 10 is a true apomorphy of the melanogaster group.

The coding sequences of Bru-3 were inferred for 8 Drosophila
species from their genomic sequenced available at FlyBase.org [37]. A distance tree was calculated in PAUP 4.0b10
[99] from the coding parts of eleven exons of Bru-3 (exons 25, 7, 9-14) shared by twelve Drosophila species. Applying
nucleotide BLASTing [90], we found that exon 6 was lost
along the branch leading to the melanogaster group (the top
shaded box), whereas exon 8 was de novo created in the
obscura group (the bottom shaded box). We verified both
events for Drosophila species in bold by amplifying and aligning the orthologous genomic regions that include exons 6
and 8 (supplementary files S1 and S2). In addition cDNA
pools from the species in bold, except for D. simulans, were
screened for inclusion of conserved exon 6 and 8 in mature
mRNA (fig. 2). The status of exon 6 indicated with a circle; a

the status of exon 8.

affinis for its presence. Exon 8 was identified in the RNA
pools of males and females from each tested obscura species, but not in D. melanogaster and D. virilis (Figure 2B).
Therefore, exon 8 originated early in the lineage of the
obscura group before the major branches [39,40] within
this group appeared.
New 3' alternative splice site in exon 10
The longer version of exon 10 was identified in four ASTs
of D. melanogaster (Table 1: transcripts 3, 7, 8 and 26).
This version of exon 10 was 24 nucleotides longer that the
previously known size of this exon in D. melanogaster (i.e.,

Splicing constraints affect the rate of sequence evolution
Splicing constraints (i.e., alternative or constitutive splicing) affect the evolutionary potential of a gene region.
Constitutively spliced regions are expected to experience
stronger functional constraints than alternatively spliced
regions of the same gene [e.g., [10,43]]. Bru-3 allows the
comparison of substitution patterns between two homologous domains present in the same gene that experience
different splicing constraints: AS RRM versus CS RRM.
Because these RRM were paralogous domains and thus
potentially shared the common ancestry, this comparison
controlled better for the variables that could bias the analysis. The AS RRM had more differences (i.e., accelerated
evolution) in comparison to the CS RRM (i.e., AS RRM:
192 bp, 19.8% sites with substitution, across species =
0.0744 Â± 0.0095, KS = 0.4034 and KA = 0.0340; CS RRM:
219 bp, 13.7% sites with substitution, across species =
0.0489 Â± 0.0067, KS = 0.2047 and KA = 0.0), and this difference was marginally significant (G2 = 2.75, p = 0.097).

Discussion
Recent bioinformatic analyses of genome databases
pointed to a correlation between intron length and alternative splicing [AS, e.g., [11,14,15]]. We studied in-depth
the interplay between intron length and AS within the
Drosophila Bruno-3 (Bru-3) gene. The molecular structure
of this gene, multiple exons separated by large introns,
was expected to be highly conducive to AS. Further, multiple Bru-3 exons are split by introns of remarkably diverse
lengths (Figure 1B, Additional file 8), and thus presented
a representative sample of intron sizes. Although only a
single gene, extensive sampling of the diversity of Bru-3

ASTs across distantly related Drosophila species provided a
case-study for several fundamental questions dealing with
the interaction between gene structure, AS and gene evolution.
The sensitivity and specificity of our analysis of ASTs was
accomplished by reverse transcription coupled with subsequent PCR and cloning. We identified 35 distinct ASTs
of Bru-3 transcribed in Drosophila adult flies (Table 1), 33
of these ASTs were previously unknown. Notably, only
seventeen ESTs of the 544,789 total D. melanogaster ESTs
map to Bru-3, whereas for example, 403 ESTs map to
myosin light chain 2 (UniGene build #59). It is well known
that genes poorly represented in EST collections are
expressed at a low level. However, such genes are more
likely to be regulatory in function and undergo AS [e.g.,
[3]], like Bru-3. Cloning and sequencing of the complete
ORF allowed the analysis of long-range contiguity of
splice choices along the entire translated region of Bru-3.
The contiguity of splice choices along a mature mRNA
could not be inferred from either EST collections or by
currently popular high-throughput methods; including
classic microarrays, tiling arrays [e.g., [34,44,45]] and
pyrosequencing of entire transcriptomes [e.g., [30]];
because frequencies of usage of individual splice choices
and/or exons along mRNAs cannot be easily concatenated
into distinct splicing variants. Below, we elaborate on several specific findings from our study.
Conservation of alternative splice variants
High conservation of ASTs of a gene implies their functional significance [e.g., [36]]. We screened for Bru-3 ASTs
in four Drosophila species. These species represented three
distantly related species groups - melanogaster, obscura, and
virilis - that were separated at least 55 million years (MY)
ago [26]. D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis are closely
related species, which diverged less than 1 MY ago [26],
and frequently share long haplotypes. Complex alternative splicing of Bru-3 was found in each tested species, and
many individual ASTs and splicing events remained conserved along 55 MY of independent evolution (Table 1
and Figure 1A). For example, the short transcript of Bru-3
that included only 4 exons out of 13 translated exons
(identified in D. melanogaster and D. persimilis) can be a
functional transcript. Likewise, 18 nucleotide-long truncations in exons 4 and 13 may reflect either a function of the
ASTs that includes these truncated exons or a common
error-generating mechanism in D. melanogaster and D.
pseudoobscura. The great diversity of conserved ASTs of Bru3 uncovered in our study implied that this gene has a complex regulatory potential with many target genes. This
spectrum of potentially distinct functions of Bru-3 is performed via ASTs of the same gene, not via gene duplications [46]. Therefore, many distinct transcripts need to be
considered to study the function(s) of Bru-3 in Drosophila.

Alternative splicing and accelerated evolution
Alternatively spliced exons (ASEs) are expected to undergo
faster divergence than constitutively spliced exons (CSEs)
at non-synonymous sites, because they are not included
in every transcript of the gene and thus experience weaker
functional constraints at the protein level [e.g.,
[43,47,48]]. The relaxation of functional constraints in
ASEs can indirectly accelerate their evolution and permit
additional diversification. Thus ASEs tend to have a higher
frequency of non-synonymous substitutions than CSEs
[e.g., [43,47-49]]. However, higher sequence conservation
was previously found at synonymous sites in ASEs [e.g.,
[48,50]] and the introns flanking ASEs [e.g., [49,51]] than
those in CSEs. To explain this counter-intuitive inference,
Xing and Lee [43,48] suggested that ASEs experienced the
stronger "RNA-level selection pressure" than CSEs, and
thus ASEs had stronger conservation at the synonymous
sites than CSEs. Indeed, AS requires the involvement of
more regulatory elements than constitutive splicing
[51,52]. However, it is unclear why "RNA-level selection
pressure" would affect non-synonymous sites differently
from synonymous sites. At the same time, ASEs tend to
have smaller sizes than CSEs [e.g., [48,49,53]], and thus
on average, splicing regulatory elements can occupy the
higher proportion of the sequence in ASEs than those in
CSEs. This bias was not always accounted for in bioinformatic analysis of exon collections [but see [49]].

The two paralogous RRMs in Bru-3 provided a system to
test the effect of splicing constraints on the evolution,
since their common ancestry supported the strongest control for potential biases. The C-terminal RRM was a CS
domain, while the N-terminal RRM was an AS domain
(Table 1). To account for the potential effect of exon size
differences, we compared only the sequences of the RRM
domains (AS RRM: 192 bp, CS RRM: 219 bp). The AS
RRM experienced accelerated evolution compared with
the CS RRM at both synonymous and non-synonymous
sites (i.e., KS and KA). Therefore, after accounting for the
different biases, we observed a trend indicating that the AS
RRM experienced weaker purifying selection pressure at
both synonymous and non-synonymous sites than the CS
RRM in Bru-3, and thus the AS of the N-terminal RRMs
could facilitate the evolution of an additional secondary
specialization of this domain.
Intron length can promote alternative splicing
The positive correlation between exon skipping and
increasing lengths of the flanking introns [11,14] has been
linked to the switch from the intron definition mechanism of splicing to the exon definition mechanism [12].
The intron definition mechanism operates effectively
across short introns, whereas the exon definition becomes
dominant when flanking introns are longer that 200-250
nucleotides [12], and thus splice sites are recognized

Page 9 of 16

BMC Genetics 2009, 10:67

across exons [42,54]. These mechanisms offer distinct predictions of splicing errors. Failures of the exon definition
mechanism lead to exon skipping, while mistakes of splicing through the intron definition mechanism result in
intron retentions [e.g., [11,54]]. However, splicing errors
of extremely large introns via recursive splicing may also
result in intron retentions. Fox-Walsh et al. [12] showed
that the intron definition mechanism was more efficient
at recognition of weak splice sites than the exon definition
mechanism. The results of our analysis of AS in Bru-3 support these conclusions. The majority of exon skipping
events mapped to the region of Bru-3 that included exons
separated by long introns (Figure 1). Exons 2 through 9 in
twelve Drosophila species [37] were separated by introns of
at least 8,000 nucleotides (Additional file 8). In contrast,
the translated exons that were always spliced contiguously
in the four tested Drosophila species - exons 9, 10 and 11,
and exons 13 and 14 - were separated by the smallest
introns in the gene, each less than 200 nucleotides (Figure
1C). Therefore, the splicing of these exons was expected to
proceed through the intron definition mechanism and
thus be more efficient than that of other exons in the ORF
of Bru-3. In the gene region between exons 9 and 14, only
exon 12 was flanked by large introns (at least 847 nucleotides), and perhaps not coincidentally, exon 12 was
skipped in more than a half of ASTs (Table 1). However,
this trend was not perfect: exons 4 and 7 were included in
almost all transcripts surveyed despite adjacency to large
introns. Nonetheless, intron length can be important
causal factor orchestrating the inclusion level of exons.
Intron length can also indirectly promote AS in general,
because longer introns can support a finer level of AS regulation than the short introns. However, the alternative 3'
SSs were identified equally frequently in both small and
long introns of Bru-3: introns 9 and 10 versus introns 3
and 12, respectively (Figure 1A). Extremely large introns
influence gene expression via their sheer size. For example, transcription of intron 7 in Bru-3 requires approximately 40 min [assuming 1 kb per min, [55,56]], and thus
large introns can substantially delay mRNA maturation.
Regulatory genes may use the interplay between transcript
elongation rate and splicing kinetics to facilitate the regulation of AS [17,56-58]. In addition, long introns can contain many regulatory elements that are necessary to
control AS at the tissue and temporal level [59,60]. Many
regulatory genes known to have ASTs contain extremely
large introns, including muscleblind, Ultrabithorax, fruitless,
kuzbanian, and pumilio [UniGene and [17]].
Intron length and the origin of coding diversity
The preferential gains of new exons within long introns
can also explain the connection between exon-skipping
and long introns. AS is strongly associated with recent
exon origin [e.g., [33,43,47,61-64]] and the rate of exon

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/67

gains is inversely related to exon inclusion level [e.g.,
[15,63,64]]. In other words, recently arisen exons tend to
be included only in a few ASTs of a gene (i.e., be minorform ASEs). Using phylogenetic analysis of 17 vertebrate
genomes, Roy et al. [15] found that newly originated
exons were more enriched within longer introns compared with short introns. Therefore, longer introns may
have slightly higher probability of exon gains than shorter
introns due to the higher number of mutable sites [15].
We identified one new putatively functional exon that was
created from an intron sequence de novo, exon 8 in D. pseudoobscura. Although this exon is flanked by the 5' and 3'
SSs which are conserved among Drosophila species separated by 60 MY of independent evolution [26], only the
species of the obscura group have a true ORF between these
SSs (Figure 2). The tested Drosophila species outside the
obscura group all have a non-translated sequence at the
homologous location to exon 8 (Additional file 5), in the
largest intron of Bru-3 - 41,973 bp in D. melanogaster and
45,859 bp in D. virilis (Figure 1C). As expected for a newly
originated exon, exon 8 is a minor-form ASE. Only one
sequenced clone of ORF of Bru-3 included exon 8 (Table
1), albeit subsequent screening found that this exon was
included in mature mRNAs in both males and females of
D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis, as well as in the other
four tested species from the obscura group (Figure 2B).
Because all tested Drosophila species share some level of
conservation between these SSs, and exon 8 is only 57 bp
long, the sequence change that capacitated exon 8 were
highly focal. Duplication-translocation of existing exons
[e.g., [65,66]], retrotransposition [e.g., [67]] or exaptation
of repetitive elements [e.g., Alu element, [62,68]] cannot
explain the origin of exon 8. The functional ORF of exon
8 was created de novo from intronic sequence between the
existing SSs that might previously function in recursive
splicing of a huge intron [16,17]. The origin of exon 8 is
especially remarkable, since all well-studied cases of de
novo exon creation from intronic sequence are known
from bioinformatic analyses of vertebrate genomes [e.g.,
[63,64,69]]. We are familiar with only one study in which
five novel genes were inferred to originate from non-coding sequences in D. melanogaster [70]. However, unlike
Bru-3 exon 8, four of these five genes had paralogous copies in the genome and thus their origins were associated
with duplication-translocation.
The pre-existing location of sequences forming both SSs
around exon 8 could play a critical role in the creation of
this exon. In contrast, the deletion of one SS could
instantly make the existing exon invisible to splicing
machinery and thus would result in complete exon loss
from mRNA and protein. The removal of translational
constraint makes an exon sequence prone to mutational
decay, akin to a pseudogene. We found one example of

such 'turning off' of an existent exon in Bru-3. The deletion of the 3' SS flanking exon 6 along the lineage to the
melanogaster group abolished its expression in this group,
though this exon was included in mature mRNAs in D.
pseudoobscura, D. persimilis, D. virilis and D. mojavensis and
appeared functional in the other analyzed Drosophila species (Figures 2A and 3). Notably, the focal deletion of the
3' SS of exon 6 also took place between two large introns
5 and 6, which are 8463 bp and 1188 pb, respectively in
D. pseudoobscura. Thus, this mutation also happened
inside a large intron and led to the disappearance of exon
6 in the melanogaster group.
If large introns are conducive for exon gain and loss (i.e.,
exon turnover), we also expect to see more splicing mistakes in large introns compared to short introns. We identified one 'nonsense' exon 4a that originated from the
largest intron of Bru-3. This exon was included into multiple ASTs in D. pseudoobscura, D. persimilis and D. melanogaster, and introduced multiple PTCs to mRNA (Table
1). Exon 4a is surrounded by conserved SSs in a proper
orientation. The 3' SS located upstream of exon 4a can be
a strong SS since it has a nearly 50 nucleotide-long pyrimidine stretch. This exon does not share major common
characteristics of internal ASEs. First, its size is unusually
large for internal ASEs in Drosophila. The average exon
length in D. melanogaster is 150 nucleotides and fewer
than 5% of exons have larger sizes than 454 nucleotides
Figure 35 in [18]. Second, the total number of nucleotides
in exon 4a is not divisible by three unlike in the majority
of ASEs, especially in minor-form ASEs [e.g., [52,53,71]].
Both of these predicted features of ASEs result from the
selection pressure to preserve an ORF (e.g., exons 3, 5, 6,
8 and 12 in Table 1). In addition, the sequence of exon 4a
looks completely unrelated between D. pseudoobscura and
D. melanogaster, while both species share the location of
the SSs flanking this exon. These SSs are conserved
between distant species because they likely function in
recursive splicing of a 36 kb-long intron [17]. We think
that the neighboring location of both SSs may bias toward
the erroneous inclusion of the encompassed intronic
sequence (i.e., 'nonsense' exon 4a) into Bru-3 mRNA.
Large introns have more opportinities to mutate than
short introns due to the higher number of potentially
mutable sites. In addition, the preferential location of
large introns in genome areas with low recombination
[72,73] can further increase the spread of new mutations
within them compared to short introns. We know from
our work on recombination variation in D. pseudoobscura
that Bru-3 resides in an extremely cold recombination
spot [74]. Notably, the deletion-biased mutation ratio
(relative to insertions) known for Drosophila [75,76],
which is expected to be especially strong in the areas of
low recombination [77,78], has not led to the shortening

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/67

of large introns in Bru-3 and other genes. At the same
time, the presence of large introns in genes likely increases
the energetic cost of their transcription, and thus highly
expressed genes in humans, Caenorhabditis and Drosophila
tend to have small introns [e.g., [60,79,80]]. Therefore,
large introns either have some selective advantage or they
can be more easily tolerated in some genes. Comeron and
Kreitman [73] suggested that the large introns could
decrease crossover interference between exons in the areas
with low recombination [but see also, [72,81]], and thus
they could be advantageous. Our data suggest that large
introns can have yet another beneficial function. Large
introns can contribute to the expansion of transcript
diversity encoded by a single gene via both AS and de novo
creation [82] or deletion of exons. Failures of proper splicing of large introns generate both exon skipping and
intron retentions (i.e., via recursive splicing) in transcripts, which are screened out by nonsense-mediated
mRNA decay (NMD) pathway [e.g., [83-85]]. The tolerance of suboptimal splicing efficiency and accuracy via
NMD in turn may allow natural selection to 'sculpt'
retained intronic sequences, like exon 4a in Bru-3, into a
new translated exons, like exon 8 in Bru-3. Many speciesspecific ASEs in mammals were likely created de novo from
purely intronic sequence [e.g., [15,63,64,86]] potentially
by the similar mechanism.

Conclusion
Drosophila Bru-3 has many exons that are separated by
introns of extremely diverse lengths. The in-detail analysis
of the ASTs of Bru-3 has inferred much greater diversity of
ASTs that has been previously unknown. Our analysis of
inclusion frequency of Bru-3 exons supported a positive
correlation between exon skipping and surrounding
intron length. The majority of cassette exons were located
in the gene region with the longest introns, between exons
2 and 9. Conversely, the exons separated by short introns,
i.e., less than 250 nucleotides, were always found splicing
consecutively. In addition, cases of evolutionary gains and
losses of exons were also mapped to long introns. Notably, we established that exon 8 was created in situ from
intronic sequence positioned between cryptic SSs, which
conserved among twelve Drosophila species. The presented
findings support the role of gene structure in promoting
and/or constraining gene's AS. However, a correlation
between the intron length and AS does not imply the causality. Both gene structure and AS can be shaped by the
interplay of selection, recombination and gene-gene interaction. Further study will determine whether the AS of
Bru-3 is a general or special case.

D. virilis (San Diego Drosophila Stock Center accession
[SDDSC] 15010-1051.87) and D. persimilis Mount St.
Helena 1993 (MSH93) were used for analysis of the AST
diversity of Bru-3. To study exon gains and losses during
Bru-3 evolution in Drosophila, we examined additional
lines - D. simulans (SDDSC 14021-0251.195), D. erecta
(SDDSC 14021-0224.01), D. ananassae (SDDSC 140240371.13), D. mojavensis (SDDSC 15081-1352-26), D.
willistoni (SDDSC 14030-0811.24), and species from the
obscura group: D. pseudoobscura bogotana El Recreo line
[89], D. miranda (SDDSC 14011-0101.08), D. affinis
(SDDSC 14012-0141.04), D. obscura (SDDSC 140110151.01), D. subobscura (SDDSC 14011-0131.09), and D.
bifasciata (SDDSC 14012-0181.02). All flies were maintained under a constant regime of temperature (20Â°C)
and humidity (80%) in 12-h dark-light cycle. A standard
mixture of agar, dextrose and yeast was used to rear flies.
RNA extraction
Total RNA was extracted from 20-30 male and female flies
using TRI reagentÂ® and the DNA-freeâ¢ kit (Ambion). Only
freshly collected flies were used for RNA extraction, tissue
was ground in TRI reagentÂ®, and proteins and lipids were
removed using a chloroform wash. Total RNA was then
precipitated and cleaned with isopropanol and ethanol,
respectively. Co-precipitated DNA was digested with
DNase I, and the remaining RNA was again precipitated
and cleaned.
RT-PCR of ORF of Bru-3 mRNA
D. pseudoobscura, D. persimilis, D. melanogaster and D. virilis cDNA pools were prepared from RNA extractions using
the SuperScriptâ¢ III first-strand Synthesis System for RTPCR (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed
with Oligo(dT)20 at 50Â° for 50 min following the manufacturer's protocol. To amplify the putatively translated
sequence of Bru-3, we designed primers specific to the 5'
and 3'-ends of the ORF (i.e., Bru3Dpse(2)20F and Bru33UTR, Additional file 9), which are highly conserved
among the twelve Drosophila species [37]. PCR was conducted in a 30 Î¼l volume with 4 Î¼l PCR buffer, 6 Î¼l Q
solution (Qiagen), 4.0-4.5 mM total MgCl2, 0.5 Î¼M of
each primer, and 3-4 units Taq DNA polymerase (New
England BioLabs). A touchdown temperature profile was
used for PCR: 10 cycles at an annealing temperature of
61Â° for 40 sec, 10 cycles at 60.5Â° for 37 sec, and finally 20
cycles at 60Â° for 35 sec. The denaturing and elongation
temperatures were the same across all cycles: 94Â° for 40
sec and 72Â° for 2 min, respectively. 15 Î¼l of PCR reaction
was used to visualize an amplicon on a 1.5% TBE agarose
gel. The remaining PCR reaction was used for cloning. We
used the StrataCloneâ¢ PCR cloning vector pSC-A (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol. Inserts were
amplified from the transformed colonies via PCR in 30 Î¼l,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/67

and PCR halves were arrayed on an agarose gel. The
amplicons of different sizes from the same cDNA pool
were preferentially sequenced to assess the diversity of
ASTs expressed in adult flies. The remaining 15 Î¼l of a PCR
reaction were cleaned by applying 1.8 Î¼l of a mixture (i.e.,
1 U to 4 U) of Exonuclease I (Exo I) and Shrimp Alkaline
Phosphatase (SAP, Fermentas) and incubating at 37Â° for
35 min. The cleaned amplicons were sequenced in both
directions with BigDye v3.0 (Applied Biosystems) and run
on an Applied Biosystem 3700 automated DNA
sequencer.
Alignment of ASTs of Bru-3
Independent clones of Bru-3 transcripts amplified from
the same cDNA pool of D. pseudoobscura had different
lengths, and thus were ASTs of the same gene. To identify
a number of exons and positions of exon junctions in D.
pseudoobscura mRNA, a few longest sequences of Bru-3
were BLASTed [BLASTN, [90]] against the genomic
sequence of D. pseudoobscura [r2.0.1, [91]] using Drosophila Species Genomes BLAST [DroSpeGe, [92]92]. We
verified that the 5' (donor) and 3' (acceptor) SSs flanking
introns [i.e., GT and AG, [38]] were directly adjacent to
each inferred exon junction in the genomic sequence.
Then, D. pseudoobscura sequences were manually aligned
in Se-Al v2.0 a11 [93] following the inferred positions of
exon junctions in Bru-3 mRNA. Sequenced transcripts of
D. persimilis, D. melanogaster and D. virilis, as well as two
D. melanogaster transcripts available at FlyBase.org were
added manually to the entire alignment of D. pseudoobscura transcripts.
Inference of Bru-3 ORF from genomic sequence
assemblies of Drosophila species
To infer the translated sequences of Bru-3 in twelve
sequenced Drosophila species [37], the sequences of individual exons of D. pseudoobscura Bru-3 were BLASTNed
[90] against the genomic sequence assemblies of Drosophila species (D. melanogaster r4.3.0, D. simulans, D.
sechellia, D. yakuba, D. erecta, D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura r2.0.1, D. persimilis, D. willistoni, D. mojavensis, D. virilis, and D. grimshawi) at DroSpeGe http://
insects.eugenes.org/species/blast/. Initially, a high statistical significance threshold [i.e., 0.01 matches were
expected to be found by chance according to the model of
[94]] was used for BLASTNing. If no matching sequence
was found in the first round, a lower significance threshold was used for the next search. We verified that each
exon junction in mRNA had the 5' and 3' SS directly adjacent to it in the genomic sequences. The exonic sequences
inferred for each Drosophila species were concatenated and
manually aligned to our D. pseudoobscura sequence of Bru3 using Se-Al v2.0a11 [93].

Exon turnover in Bru-3
Two putatively novel exons of Bru-3, exons 6 and 8 (Figure
1A), were identified in D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis.
These exons were absent in the two transcripts of Bru-3
described in D. melanogaster (Flybase.org). We failed to
find homologous exons in the melanogaster group species
using both BLASTNing and TBLASTNing. To confirm that
the identified exons were absent from a genomic sequence
and their disappearance is not a genome assembly mistake, we amplified and sequenced the homologous
regions encompassing exons 6 and 8 in D. melanogaster,
D. simulans, D. erecta, D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura, D.
persimilis, D. mojavensis, D. willistoni and D. virilis using
primers to the conserved sequences flanking these homologous regions (Additional file 9). The PCR and sequencing of amplicons were conducted as above. The obtained
sequences were aligned with the corresponding genomic
regions downloaded from DroSpeGe using the web-based
T-Coffee [95] under default settings. The preliminary
alignments were manually edited in Se-Al.

The above assay tested for mistakes in genome assemblies
only at the homologous positions. However, exons 6 and
8 could be translocated into non-homologous locations
and still participate in the formation of Bru-3 mRNA [e.g.,
via trans-splicing [96]]. Therefore, we also screened the
cDNA pools of D. melanogaster, D. erecta, D. ananassae, D.
mojavensis, D. willistoni, D. virilis and, as a positive control,
D. pseudoobscura for the presence of sequences similar to
exons 6 and 8 using PCR. This screen assumes that the
sequences of exons 6 and 8 in the tested species remained
conserved to those in D. pseudoobscura. The primers bound
to exons 6 and 9 were used to screen cDNA for exon 6. For
exon 8, we used two pairs of primers: the 1st pair was specific for exons 7 and 8; and the 2nd bound to exons 8 and
10 (Additional file 9). PCR was performed as above, but
Q solution (Qiagen) was excluded from a PCR cocktail.
Amplicons were sequenced in both directions to verify
their specificity. Finally, to thoroughly analyze the origin
of exon 8 within the obscura group, both tests were also
performed for the species representing its four major subgroups: the obscura, subobscura, pseudoobscura and affinis
subgroups [39,40].
Screening cDNA pools for specific exon combination
Only transcript 6, which was identified in D. pseudoobscura, had exons 3, 4, and 5 spliced contiguously (Table
1). We failed to sample the ASTs with this particular exon
combination from any other tested species. However, one
of the two known transcripts of D. melanogaster has this
exon combination (transcript 2 in Table 1). To test for the
presence of this exon combination in other Drosophila species, we screened cDNA pools using PCR with primers
bound to exons 3 and 5 (Additional file 9). We also
screened for one potential exon combination - contigu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/67

ously spliced exons 5, 6, and 7 - that has not been found
in any tested species (Table 1). Amplicons were checked
on a 2% TBA agarose gel, purified using Exo I and SAP
(Fermentas) digestion and sequenced in both directions
to verify their specificity.
Splicing constrains and molecular evolution
Splicing constraints (i.e., alternative or constitutive splicing) can affect the evolutionary potential of a gene region.
Constitutively spliced regions are expected to experience
stronger functional constraints than alternatively spliced
regions of the same gene [e.g., [43]]. To test this prediction, we compared substitution patterns between two
RRMs in Bru-3. Although, two regions of Bru-3 are homologous to the same RRM domain, and thus share the common ancestry, they are likely under different selection
constrains. The C-terminal RRM of Bru-3 was constitutively spliced, whereas the N-terminal RRM was alternatively spliced in mRNA (Table 1). We used a conserved
domain database [i.e., CDD at NCBI web page, [97]] to
precisely localize two RRMs in Bru-3 and analyzed substitution patterns separately within both domains. The
number of sites with substitutions, total number of substitutions, nucleotide diversity (Â¶) and its standard deviation
(sdÂ¶) were estimated in both domains among twelve Drosophila species [37] using DnaSP 4.20.2 [98]. In this context, we use Â¶ as a measure of sequence diversity among
the sampled species rather than within a species. We also
calculated the ratios of synonymous/non-synonymous
substitutions over the total number of synonymous/nonsynonymous sites (KS and KA) for each exon between D.
pseudoobscura and D. melanogaster.
5'- and 3'-end UTRs of Bru-3 in D. pseudoobscura and D.
persimilis
To identify the transcribed but untranslated sequence of
Bru-3, we used the FirstChoiceÂ® RNA ligase mediatedrapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE) kit
(Ambion) following the manufacturer's directions. All
RACE reactions were performed on the total RNA
extracted from adult females of the D. pseudoobscura Flagstaff 1993 strain. Bru-3Dmel-58F and PsBru3Pout are
gene-specific primers used for 5'-end and 3'-end RACE,
respectively (Additional file 9). The obtained sequence
allowed us to design primers specific to both untranslated
regions. Bru3Dmel(UTR)+760F and Bru3Dros(1)55R
were used to amplify the 5' UTR in both lines of D. pseudoobscura, D. persimilis and D. melanogaster. To amplify the
3' UTR from both lines of D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis, we used PCR with Bru3end-1F and Bru3UTR-2R primers (Additional file 9). PCR was conducted as above with
Q solution (Qiagen). All amplicons were digested with
Exo I and SAP (Fermentas) and sequenced directly, without intermediate cloning.
