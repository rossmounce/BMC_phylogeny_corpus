Abstract
Background: Studies on allele length polymorphism designate several glacial refugia for Norway spruce (Picea
abies) in the South Carpathian Mountains, but infer only limited expansion from these refugia after the last
glaciation. To better understand the genetic dynamics of a South Carpathian spruce lineage, we compared ancient
DNA from 10,700 and 11,000-year-old spruce pollen and macrofossils retrieved from Holocene lake sediment in the
Retezat Mountains with DNA extracted from extant material from the same site. We used eight primer pairs that
amplified short and variable regions of the spruce cpDNA. In addition, from the same lake sediment we obtained a
15,000-years-long pollen accumulation rate (PAR) record for spruce that helped us to infer changes in population
size at this site.
Results: We obtained successful amplifications for Norway spruce from 17 out of 462 pollen grains tested, while
the macrofossil material provided 22 DNA sequences. Two fossil sequences were found to be unique to the
ancient material. Population genetic statistics showed higher genetic diversity in the ancient individuals compared
to the extant ones. Similarly, statistically significant Ks and Kst values showed a considerable level of differentiation
between extant and ancient populations at the same loci.
Lateglacial and Holocene PAR values suggested that population size of the ancient population was small, in the
range of 1/10 or 1/5 of the extant population. PAR analysis also detected two periods of rapid population growths
(from ca. 11,100 and 3900 calibrated years before present (cal yr BP)) and three bottlenecks (around 9180, 7200
and 2200 cal yr BP), likely triggered by climatic change and human impact.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that the paternal lineages observed today in the Retezat Mountains persisted at
this site at least since the early Holocene. Combination of the results from the genetic and the PAR analyses
furthermore suggests that the higher level of genetic variation found in the ancient populations and the loss of
ancient allele types detected in the extant individuals were likely due to the repeated bottlenecks during the
Holocene; however our limited sample size did not allow us to exclude sampling effect.
This study demonstrates how past population size changes inferred from PAR records can be efficiently used in
combination with ancient DNA studies. The joint application of palaeoecological and population genetics analyses
proved to be a powerful tool to understand the influence of past population demographic changes on the haplotype
diversity and genetic composition of forest tree species.

Background
In the last two decades ancient DNA (aDNA) has been
successfully extracted from fossil plant material, and the
results from the specimens of late Quaternary remains
(up to 100 ka yrs) have provided insights into many evolutionary processes [1-9]. These studies represented the
first attempts in linking extant and fossil plant populations and provided important information on genetic
changes through time. Parducci et al. [7] did a promising attempt to analyze short chloroplast DNA (cpDNA)
regions in fossil pollen extracted from a Holocene lake
sediment in Sweden. Fossil pollen grains are abundant
in lake sediments. Under ideal preservation conditions
(neutral pH, low temperature, no oxygen) the study of
pollen DNA allows studying past demographic events by
analyzing neutrally evolving regions of the organelle
genome, such as microsatellites and introns [10,11].
During the Quaternary (last 2.6 million years) climatic
oscillations have dramatically influenced the distribution
of plant species [12]. Repeated range expansions and
contractions in response to warming and cooling
resulted in large-scale demographic changes with consequent impact on their genetic composition [11].
Progress in aDNA-based phylogenetic and population
genetic studies have been very rapid in animal species
and lately several specific primers have been designed to
study population-level changes (reviewed in Leonard
[13] and Hofreiter [14]). Rohland et al. [15] have for
example detected divergence events between mammoth
and the two extant elephant species. Barnes et al. [16]
and Valdiosera et al. [17] successfully reconstructed
population movements during the last glaciation in
brown bears and detected frequent events of extinctions
and recolonizations. Unfortunately, similar studies on
woody plants are still in their infancy with few attempts
done on fossil pollen and wood [7,18,19]. This is despite
the many questions that plant aDNA analyses are amenable to answer [20].
In this study we focus on Picea abies (Norway spruce),
one of the ecologically and economically most important
forest tree species in Europe. Pollen and macrofossil evidence combined with genetic surveys of the current
European populations of this species showed that its wideranging distribution in central and south-eastern Europe
originated from several glacial refugia [21-26]. One such
refugium was identified in the South Carpathians, where
several unique cpDNA and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
haplotypes suggested long-lasting isolation [22,25]. Populations from these regions showed lower level of genetic
variation compared to other refugial populations in central
Europe, and north- and westward postglacial expansion
from this area showed to be limited, as these haplotypes
do not appear in the central and northwest European

populations today. In addition, the genetic diversity
increased north of the Carpathians, probably as a result of
admixture of expanding populations from two separate
refugia. Tollefsrud et al. [25] suggested that the dry plains
of central and south-eastern Europe, including the Hungarian Plain, formed an ecological barrier to any expansion, whereas humid mountain ranges elsewhere in central
Europe facilitated the northward spread of other spruce
lineages. The lateglacial and early Holocene warming also
brought major altitudinal displacements of the species
range in the South Carpathians [27,28]. In addition, fossil
pollen records indicate that a large proportion of glacial
lowland coniferous woodlands went destroyed by fire in
the early Holocene as summer temperatures rose [29]. An
ongoing pollen and plant macrofossil study of a sediment
sequence retrieved from a lake located in the Retezat
Mountains (Tăul dintre Brazi) in the South Carpathian
Range demonstrates that at the onset of the early Holocene warming (around 11,000 cal yr BP) a rapid population expansion of Norway spruce took place around this
lake [30].
Based on all this knowledge, we hypothesized two possible population demographic scenarios during the
Holocene in the South Carpathian refugium. (1) The
spruce populations of the Retezat Mountains remained
constrained to this region with a relatively constant
population size. In this case we expect to find the same
haplotypes and similar levels of diversity in extant and
ancient samples. (2) The population of the Retezat Mts
underwent significant demographic changes, most probably due to climatic shifts and anthropogenic influences.
In this case we expect altered haplotype frequencies in
the extant population relative to the ancient population,
and different levels of genetic diversity.
To asses the consistency of the two scenarios, we analyzed fossil spruce pollen and other macrofossils (seeds
and cone scales) from the early Holocene section of a
sediment core extracted at lake Tăul dintre Brazi (TDB)
in the Retezat Mountains (Figure 1). We analyzed
cpDNA from material retrieved from two radiocarbon
dated sediment layers (11,000 and 10,700 cal yr BP levels)
(Figure 2) and compared results with genetic data
obtained from the extant spruce population of the Retezat Mountains. Population genetic inferences from the
past were then linked to a 15,000-year record of spruce
pollen accumulation rates (PAR) obtained from the same
sediment core and used to infer past population size
changes. PAR values represent the number of pollen
grains accumulated at the sediment surface (cm 2 ) in a
year and they can be directly related to the population
size of the studied taxon in the effective pollen source
area of the examined lake [31]. The importance of this
relationship has been long recognized by palaeoecologists

[32] and used to reconstruct past population growth rates
[33,34]. Recently, the collection of forestry data allowed
direct comparison of surface sediment PAR values with
actual biomass and population sizes in modern forests
and thus the projection of PAR-based population size
estimates back in time [35].

Results
We analyzed eight different cpDNA regions in extant
and fossil material from Norway spruce and six of them
showed polymorphism (Table 1). The alignment of the
extant sequences revealed 13 point mutations and five
length polymorphisms that yielded nine haplotypes
(Table 1 and Additional File 1). Two haplotypes were
the most common (Ht2 and Ht8) found in 15 and 22
out of 58 individuals, respectively. Out of 462 fossil pollen grains analyzed we obtained totally 28 positive
amplifications (three amplifications for fragment B, four
for fragment D, ten for fragment TL, seven for fragment

LF, two for the non-variable fragment CK, and finally
two for the non-variable fragment MD). The higher
amplification success (16.5%) obtained with pollen compared to Parducci et al. [7] was likely due to the choice
of using more (usually five) pollen grains instead of one
during amplification trials, or it may simply indicates
favorable condition for DNA survival in the lake sediment at the Retezat. After sequencing, four of the 28
amplicons (two obtained with primers B and two with
primers D) showed to be of Pinus origin, while seven
amplicons obtained with primers LF were of Abies origin. Pollen grains of these two taxa were present in the
examined sediment layer [30] and they were likely
selected by mistake during the analyses. The rest of the
amplicons were assigned to P. abies. Another possible
explanation for the findings of Pinus and Abies
sequences is DNA contamination from molecules of the
surrounding sediment that may permeate or adhere to
macrofossils in the sediments [36]. Nevertheless, these

sequences still provide authentic early Holocene DNA
information from Pinus and Abies individuals.
Out of the investigated six Norway spruce seeds, DNA
was successfully amplified from five seeds. Altogether,
we obtained 15 positive amplifications (one for fragment
B, three for fragment D, three for fragment TL, two for
region Li, one for region LF, two for fragment K2i, one
for the non-variable CK fragment, and two for the nonvariable fragment M) (Table 1). When sequences were
concatenated, the total length of the haplotypes varied
between 124 and 1016 bp in the five seeds, and between
136 and 251 bp in pollen. Concatenation of the four
regions amplified from the 4 cone scales gave a haplotype with a total length of 901 bp. Because cpDNA is
paternally inherited in Norway spruce, sequence difference between cone and seed haplotypes (mother-tree
versus offspring) were not unexpected. We found three
transversion substitutions at position 77 in fragment D
(C > A), position 197 in fragment TL (C > A) and position 157 in fragment Li (A > C). Finally, replication of
the analyses done at Uppsala University using four new
seeds retrieved at 502, 513, 525 and 545 cm depths in
the same sediment, gave two positive amplifications
(from sample 502 and 545 cm) using primers B. Both
sequences were of Norway spruce origin and showed
the 12A + 5G block, the most common variant present
in the extant population.

Comparison of ancient and extant sequences

After manually editing for base call errors, we performed an alignment between homologous regions
obtained in extant and ancient individuals. The alignment revealed mismatches at several positions. Transition substitutions (G > A and C > T) were interpreted
as incorrect nucleotide PCR incorporations due to postmortem lesions in the ancient DNA molecules, a common problem when amplifications are performed from
degraded DNA molecules [5]. We therefore neglected
two G > A substitutions detected in sample P13 (fragment TL, positions 168 & 206 in Table 1). The rest of
the substitutions were considered authentic, i.e. due to
true polymorphism. Two variants were unique to the
ancient population: a 10A + 7G repetition found in sample S9 (fragment B), and a GA dinucleotide substitution
present in sample P13 (fragment TL). As expected, variants that were common to the extant population were
also found in the ancient material (e.g. the common A,
A, and C nucleotides at positions 77, 78 and 82 in fragment D was found in seeds S3 and S10). However, also
rare variants found in extant individuals were detected
among the ancient samples. For example, the 10A + 6G
repetition in fragment B, and the C > A substitution at
position 157 in fragment Li, both with a frequency 0.017
in the extant population, were found in sample P1 and
S4, respectively. Similarly, a C > A substitution at

Population genetic analyses

Phylogenetic relationships of ancient and extant
specimens

Estimates of nucleotide diversity, haplotype diversity and
average number of nucleotide differences calculated at
the six polymorphic cpDNA loci are presented in Table
2. Observed values for fragment D, TL and Li suggest
that the ancient spruce population harbored higher
levels of genetic variation compared to the extant population. Fst values at these loci were also statistically significant, an unusual result considering the low level of
differentiation usually observed among populations of
conifer species. Nucleotide-based genetic differentiation
(K s and K st ,) was also statistically significant at these
three loci. On the whole, our results suggest differentiation between extant and ancient spruce populations that

Results of the phylogenetic analyses conducted on separate loci based on all sequences available (data set c in
the Methods) for fragments D, TL, Li and LF are presented in Figure 3. A small group of sequences is
formed by nine extant and four ancient sequences in
the case of fragment D, while the other two ancient
sequences are grouped with the rest of the extant material. In the case of LF fragment, the ancient sequences
obtained from the cone and seed S8 are clustering
together with the majority of the extant samples, while a
smaller group of extant sequences that included samples
collected on the northern slopes of the Retezat, form a

Finally, the a median-joining network created using

Figure 5 shows pollen accumulation rates (PAR) of Norway spruce calculated at Tăul dintre Brazi for the last
ca. 15,700 cal yr BP. PAR values are very low until
11,100 cal yr BP (0-270 grains cm-2yr-1) with an average
of 120 grains cm-2yr-1 that indicate very small population size in the Retezat Mts (ca. 1.2 - 6.4 trees per hectare according to the equation of Seppä et al. [35] for
the Finnish woodlands). The Lateglacial interstadial,
between 14,450 and 12,900 cal yr BP (zone 2 in Figure
5) show moderately higher PAR values (av. 155 grains
cm -2 yr-1 ). These values, together with the concurrent
findings of spruce stomata (Figure 6), suggest the presence of a small lakeshore population during the Lateglacial interstadial at the study site. It is likely that
spruce was absent from the lakeshore prior to this period and for a short period during the successive
Younger Dryas climatic reversal (zone 3), between ca.
12,600-12,400 cal yr BP. From ca. 11,100 cal yr BP (period 4 and 5) a massive increase in spruce PAR, stomata
concentration and pollen frequencies commenced with
PAR values increasing from 200 to nearly 7000 grains
cm-2yr-1 in about 1000 years. Such values are equivalent
to an approximate population size increase from 9 to
101 trees per hectare [35]. It should be noticed however,
that due to approximation in the PAR-based population
size extrapolations only the magnitude of this change is
certain. Subsequently, the highest overall Holocene PAR
values and hence inferred population size was detected
between ca. 10,100 and 9180 cal yr BP (av. 4886 grains

PAR values until 7200 cal yr BP (zone 6). At this time, a
significant decrease suggests also a decrease in population size (from ca. 252 to 120 trees per hectare on the
basis of Seppä et al. [35]). These values were maintained
until ca. 3900 cal yr BP and were followed by a second
significant increase between 3900 and 2200 cal yr BP
(zone 8). Finally, the PAR curve suggests a third
decrease in population size after 2200 cal yr BP. This
period coincides with the late Iron Age increase in livestock and the development of high altitude seasonal pasturing in the Romanian Carpathians [37] suggesting
intensive timber exploitation by humans in the region.
Overall, the PAR record suggests that following an early
Holocene massive population increase on the northern
slopes of the Retezat, the spruce population size did not
remain constant, but showed marked fluctuation with
three clear population bottlenecks dated to ca. 9180,
7200 and 2200 cal yr BP.

Discussion
Patterns of plant genetic diversity in Europe show that
levels of diversity usually decrease during postglacial
colonization from the refugia [25,38-41]. There can be
however large differences between colonization routes
followed by different plant species due to climatic and
environmental factors, altitudinal range expansion and

contraction, proximity to the ice sheets, and topography.
Results from our study suggest that these factors were
crucial in determining the distribution and demography
that shaped the genetic structure of the populations of
the South Carpathians in the Retezat. In Central Europe,
high levels of diversity are usually found in the oldest
spruce regions ( i.e. where spruce pollen is present since
at least the Early Holocene), in the south-eastern Alps,
southern Bohemian Massif, West Carpathians and
northern Dinaric Alps [25]. The only exception is the
South Carpathian refugium, where scientists have found
unique haplotypes and relatively low diversity levels in
extant populations [25]. Indeed, in our study we found a
decreased genetic variation in the extant populations in
the Retezat compared to the ancient population, and
such lower diversity could be easily associated with the
several population bottlenecks identified by the PAR
data. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that the limited
number of fossil sequences affected the interpretation of
the aDNA data.
It is reasonable to assume that the fluctuations
observed in population size after an early Holocene
rapid expansion at Tăul dintre Brazi had a substantial
impact on the genetic structure of the spruce population. The pollen record shows that a small population
was already established in the lateglacial period around
13,900 cal yr BP at high altitudes formerly covered by

Magyari et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:66
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/66

glacier ice (Figure 5 and 6) supporting the presence of a
refugium in this area. Such a refugium has been also
detected by genetic analysis conducted on living populations by Bucci & Vendramin [22] and Tollefsrud et al.
[25]. Assuming therefore that spruce was present and
probably abundant throughout the last glacial cycle at
lower elevations in the Retezat, it is likely that our
sampled ancient population is similar in genetic composition to this refugial population. The pollen and the
stomata record (Figure 6) show that the lateglacial
expansion came to a halt during the Younger Dryas climatic reversal (between ca. 12,900 and 11,500 cal yr
BP), and the spruce population was greatly reduced
and/or eradicated from the lakeshore [30]. The species
expanded again during the early Holocene and our
ancient material was sampled at the beginning of this
second population expansion that started around 11,100
cal yr BP. Such increase in population size started from
a population that was very small, according to the PAR
record about 1/10 or 1/5 of the extant one, and that
successively increased between ca. 11,100 and 10,100 cal
yr BP. A significant increase in population size, however,
only began around 10,000 cal yr BP, when the largest
overall Holocene distribution was reached. Fossil pollen
data from this site (Figure 5) indicates that between
10,100 and 9180 cal yr BP Norway spruce replaced European larch (Larix decidua) on the lakeshore and probably also in other areas at the same altitudinal belt [30].
By this time, the population increased to a number that
likely exceeded the extant population size.
According to the PAR record, the maximum extension
of Norway spruce in the Retezat was followed by three
distinct population bottlenecks. The first reduction
occurred at 9180 cal yr BP and was likely caused by a
local population decline due to the expanding lake surface area [42]. A second reduction in size occurred at
7200 cal yr BP and it was attributable to the climateinduced spread of European hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) that partially replaced former mixed Norway spruce
- hazel forests at mid elevations [27,42]. The third bottleneck started 2200 years ago and was of anthropogenic
origin as suggested by the accompanying decrease in
many other arboreal elements and the spread of humanindicator herbs [42].
Typically, population bottlenecks are characterized by
loss in allelic richness and a more limited decrease of
genetic diversity at neutral loci [43]. This theory however is not strictly applicable to the events that seem to
have occurred during postglacial recolonization in the
Retezat. In our case, a combination of factors may have
acted to limit the initial loss in allelic richness (original
large population sizes in the early Holocene), and later
to increase it (population bottlenecks and range fragmentation due to forest management). Several pollen

Page 9 of 15

studies and historical documents show indeed that forest management was intense from 2200 cal years BP
and destroyed the large continuous distribution of Norway spruce in this region [27,44,45].
Results from the genetic and PAR analyses seem
therefore to support the hypothesis that the higher
ancient genetic variability and the absence of some
ancient haplotypes in the extant spruce populations was
due to repeated bottlenecks experienced during the
Holocene in the Retezat. In addition, as suggested by
Tollefsrud et al. [25], the dry plains of central and
south-eastern Europe, may also have acted as an ecological barrier to the expansion of the early Holocene
populations from this site, whereas humid mountain
ranges elsewhere in central Europe facilitated the northward spread of new spruce lineages in the successive
periods. As a result, despite the proximity to the South
Carpathian refugium, the genetic diversity of this site
declined during the Holocene.

Conclusions
This study demonstrates how past population size
changes inferred from PAR records can be efficiently
used in combination with aDNA data. The joint application of palaeoecological and population genetic analyses
proved to be a powerful tool to understand the influence of past population demographic changes on the
haplotype diversity and genetic composition of an
important forest tree species. We used a pollen and
plant macrofossil-based aDNA approach and traced
population size changes of Norway spruce in a refugial
area in the South Carpathian Mountains. Results clearly
show that the paternal lineage observed at the beginning
of the Holocene in the Retezat Mts persisted at the site
until today. Problems associated with low sample size in
our aDNA data could be overcome by the information
obtained from the PAR data that clearly showed significant population size fluctuations in the Retezat Mts during the Holocene. This combined information support
the hypothesis that the spruce population of the Retezat
Mts underwent significant demographic changes, most
probably due to climatic shifts and anthropogenic influences, and that likely these changes significantly altered
the haplotype frequencies and the level of genetic
diversity.
This study thus laid down the first basis for further
aDNA analyses. By examining additional levels of this
sediment profile we can provide further insight to support the hypotheses presented in this study.
We have shown also that longer sequences, and
more robust phylogenetic inferences can be obtained
from plant macrofossils like seeds and cone scales
when aliquots of the DNA extracts are used in multiple PCR reactions providing sequences from different

Magyari et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:66
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/66

cpDNA regions. Similar attempts performed with fossil
pollen grains were not as successful limiting at the
moment population genetic inferences to single loci.
On the other hand, multiple PCR products (obtained
by applying multiple primer sets in one reaction) and
thus longer sequences might be obtained from pollen
using the new generation sequencing platforms, like
the 454 GS FLX [14,46] or multiple-loci PCR analyses.
With this type of analyses, the use of DNA extracted
from plant macrofossils allows the study of longer
DNA sequences or, in the case of the 454 platform,
even complete genomes from ancient plant specimens
providing good resolution data sets for population
genetic analyses, as recently done with an extinct cave
bear species [47]. The main obstacle to the use of
plant macrofossils for detecting population level
changes is the limited number of individuals that can
be obtained from a sediment sample. In cases, however, where macrofossils are well preserved and
retrieved in large quantities from multiple time horizons [48], they can easily provide multiple genotypes
suitable for population genetic studies similarly to our
recovery of an intact 11,000-year-old Norway spruce
cone from Tăul dintre Brazi. In such cases, the opportunity offered by new data analytical methods in population genetics that work with multi-locus data,
enables an efficient use of a relatively small number of
individuals in the reconstruction of past population
demographic changes [49]. Indeed, there are several
fossil sites in Europe where Upper Weichselian (ca.
11,500 - 45,000 cal yr BP) plant macrofossils from single or multiple chronological horizons have been
recovered in large numbers [24]. In the Carpathians,
for example, numerous Picea sp., Pinus cembra and
Larix sp. cones have been reported from several last
glacial (15,000-45,000 cal yr BP) and Holocene peat
sediments [50,51]. Such material seems ideal for aDNA
analysis, as both organellar and nuclear DNA in the
seeds of these cones hold many alleles. Its study have
the potential of revealing ancient genetic diversity in
cryptic northern refugia and adding valuable information on the role of this area in the postglacial recolonization of northern and western Europe [11].
Our analyses in particular proved that the use of
aDNA in combination with PAR data obtained from the
same site can be very efficient in discovering demographic changes that occurred in the past in Norway
spruce, and will hopefully be used in other wind-pollinated tree species. Finally, PAR-inferred demographic
scenarios offer the opportunity of being incorporated in
coalescence-based Bayesian mutation rate estimations,
and this way more accurate substitution rates can be
obtained [52].

Methods
Ancient material

Our ancient material came from the early Holocene part
of a 5-m long sediment sequence extracted at Tăul dintre Brazi (0.5 ha, 1740 m a.s.l.). The lake is situated in a
north-facing slope of the Retezat Mts, South Carpathians (Figure 1) and was formed in a glacial basin
approximately 15,700 years ago, directly after the retreat
of the Lolaia glacier from this valley [42,53]. Today, the
forest around the lake consists of P. abies, Pinus cembra
(Stone pine), Pinus mugo (Mountain pine) and Rhododendron myrtifolium. The core was analysed for fossil
pollen, plant macrofossils, and an age-depth model was
constructed based on eleven radiocarbon determinations
of terrestrial plant macro remains (Additional File 2)
[42]. Pollen preservation was excellent throughout the
entire core. The sediment sample from which the spruce
pollen grains were retrieved for DNA analysis was
organic-rich gyttja showing the first major concentration
increase of spruce pollen (533 cm; Figure 2). The age of
the studied layer was 10,700 cal yr BP.
An intact Norway spruce cone at 545 cm sediment
depth and dated 11,000 cal yr BP [42], was used for
aDNA analysis (Figure 2). Half of this cone was sent to
the Poznań Radiocarbon Laboratory for dating, while
the other half including 6 seeds and 4 cone scales was
used for aDNA analysis. The fossil spruce pollen and
cone were analyzed in the arche DNA laboratory of the
Hungarian Natural History Museum (NHMUS).
Replication of the aDNA analyses was performed at
Uppsala University, where DNA from four additional
seeds were analyzed. These seeds were retrieved from
the same sediment at 502, 513, 525 and 545 cm depths
corresponding to 9972, 10,145, 10,331 and 11,000 cal yr
BP, respectively.
Pre-PCR preparation of the fossil samples - Molecular
Taxonomy Laboratory at the Natural History Museum of
Budapest, Hungary (NHMUS)

In a clean-air, DNA-free room (room 1) at the archeDNA laboratory of NHMUS, one cm 3 sediment was
removed from the inner section of the core at 533 cm
using sterile scalpels (Figure 2). The sample was sieved
through 120 μm mesh and stored in sterile distilled
water at 2°C until further treatment. Aliquots of the filtrate were examined under a light microscope at magnification x100 (Olympus CX 42). Spruce pollen grains
were isolated and serially moved between water drops
on microscope slides using sterile Hamilton syringes.
Totally, we selected 462 fossil pollen grains from sediments dated 10,700 cal BP and stored them at -80°C
until aDNA analysis. For PCR set up we followed the
methods described in Parducci et al. [7], but we

Magyari et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:66
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/66

increased the number of pollen grains up to five in each
aliquots prepared for amplification and used a finer
mesh (120 μm instead of 180 μm) to obtain more efficient concentration of the grains.
Seeds and cone scales were separated from the 11,000year-old fossil cone under a sterile hood irradiated by
high intensity UV light (1 J/cm2, 1 hour, several times,
turning around the particles at each step to decontaminate the whole surface). All lab ware used for manipulations (forceps, tubes, pestles and mortars, etc.) was
nightly UV-irradiated.
In a second room in the arche DNA lab (room 2) we
transferred the pollen grains on sterilized microscope
slides using a sterile Hamilton syringe and washed
them separately ten times with UV-irradiated sterile
water. After washing, we moved five to six grains to
separate UV-irradiated sterile PCR microtube with 5
μL UV-irradiated sterile water. Along with each tube,
we prepared also a negative control including 5 μL of
the last drop of water used for washing the five grains.
The tubes were stored at -20°C and before PCR they
were transferred to the third room in the arche DNA
lab (room 3) where the frozen pollen grains were
crushed on ice with a sterile pestle in 12 μL sterile distilled water. Five μL aliquots were immediately used as

Page 11 of 15

template for PCR. Each pollen sample was amplified
with one primer pair. A reagent blank and a negative
control including 5 μL of the last washing water were
prepared for each amplification.
DNA from seeds and cone scales was extracted in
room 3. We manually powdered the material using a
NucleoSpin Plant II Kit (Macherey-Nagel) and following
the CTAB protocol provided by the manufacturer in
100 μL elution volume. Aliquots of each seed DNA
extract was amplified with all primers used in this study.
DNA amplification and sequencing

We selected eight primer pairs (six specifically designed
for this study) that amplified short and variable and
neutral regions from the spruce cpDNA (pseudogenes,
microsatellites, intergenic spacers and introns). In addition, we used two cpDNA microsatellite primer pairs
previously used by Parducci et al. [7]. The name of the
amplified regions, the sequence of the primers and the
expected length in Norway spruce of the eight fragments are listed in Table 3. The primers developed for
this study were designed using Clone Manager Suite 7
(SciEd) using Pinus thunbergii and P. sitchensis reference
sequences and P. abies chloroplast cpDNA sequences
retrieved from GeneBank.

DNA amplifications were performed on all DNA
extracts (from pollen, seeds and cone) using single primers pairs. We used 20 μL that included 5 μL of template solution (regardless of the source), 1x reaction
buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM dNTP (each), 0.25 mM
forward and reverse primers, and 0.4 U of AmpliTaq
Gold polymerase (Applied Biosystems). The PCR profile
was 10 min at 94°C, 45 cycles of 20 sec at 94°C, 30 sec
at 55°C, 1 min at 72°C and final elongation 7 min at 72°
C. Five μL of the PCR reactions were tested for amplicons on 2% agarose by gel-electrophoresis in 0.5x TBE
and stained with ethidium bromide. In case of successful
amplification, 2-3 μL of the first PCR product was reamplified and purified using High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche) in a PCR room in the modern DNA
lab at NHMUS where spruce had never been processed
before (room 4). Finally, DNA sequencing reactions
were prepared in a fifth room at NHMUS (room 5)
using 10 ng of purified PCR products using forward and
reverse primers and BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle
Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). After purification
the products were run on a 3130 Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems).
Analysis on extant material

Fresh needles were collected from 52 adult trees of
extant spruce populations located in the Retezat Mts. In
addition, we sampled needles from 6 herbarium specimens (5 from the Carpathians, 1 from the Austrian
Alps) (Figure 1; Additional File 3). Needles were stored
at 4°C until use, and total genomic DNA was extracted
with DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN). PCR amplifications and DNA sequencing were performed after all fossil DNA analyses had been completed in room 6 that
was physically separated from rooms 1-3 at the archeDNA laboratory, and also from room 4 in the modern
DNA laboratory, using the same procedures as for the
fossil material.
Altogether 833 sample and 322 control PCR reactions
were done on the modern and extant material at
NHMUS (without re-amplification and sequencing
PCRs).
DNA amplification, cloning and sequencing - Molecular
Genetic Laboratory (EBC, Uppsala University, Sweden)

Replication of the aDNA analyses was performed on
four seeds using the Quiagen Multiplex PCR kit and
increasing the number of amplification cycles to 38.
This kit contains a built-in hot start polymerase enzyme
and a unique PCR buffer that makes it appropriate for
the amplification of difficult templates like in the case of
fragmented aDNA. We run single reactions with single
primer pairs at a time in 20 μL volume, including 3 μL
of extracted DNA solution, 1X Multiplex PCR Master

Page 12 of 15

Mix (QIAGEN), 0.2 μM of each primer, and water for
adjusting the final volume. After amplification 5 uL of
PCR products visible as bands of the expected size on
2% agarose gel were purified using ExoSAP-IT (Affymetrix, Inc.). Two μL of purified product was used directly
for cloning using the CloneJet PCR Cloning Kit (Fermentas). Two μL of the purified products were ligated
into pJET1.2/blunt Cloning Vector in the presence of
T4 DNA ligase at room temperature for 30’. Fifty μL of
competent DH5 cells were transformed using 5 μl of the
ligation and grown in SOC solution for 90’ at 37°C. The
cells were plated on LB-ampicillin plates. Colonies were
screened in 10 uL PCRs using pJET universal primers
and following manufacture’s instructions. All clones
with inserts of expected sizes were sequenced using
Macrogen DNA Sequencing service in Korea.
Precautions against contamination and criteria used for
sequence authentication

We extracted DNA in environments specifically dedicated to aDNA studies (see methods). At NHMUS in
Hungary and at EBC in Sweden all analyses on ancient
material were performed in separate DNA-free rooms,
in laboratories specifically dedicated to aDNA work and
physically separated from laboratories where the modern
DNA analyses were performed. Analyses on extant
material were performed after aDNA analyses had been
completed. No amplifications were obtained in extraction and reagent controls and amplifications from
aDNA extracts always produced PCR products visible
on agarose gel as single and clear bands.
Cloning is generally performed in the case of aDNA
studies to detect mosaic sequences as a result of
jumping PCR between sequences, to identify amplification errors due to post-mortem DNA damage in the
template and to detect PCR-slippage in the case of
microsatellites [20,54]. Initially we planned to
sequence PCR products using forward and reverse primers to detect sequence variants after cloning.
Because we found no sequence variation in our products after three independent cycle-sequencing assays,
we disregarded the cloning step at NHMUS. The multiple cycle-sequencing method also allowed us to
exclude the presence of artifacts resulting from PCRslippage in the microsatellite B region. Importantly,
generation of mosaic sequences was excluded in our
case due to the uniparental inheritance of the chloroplast genome in spruce.
Data analysis

Ancient and extant DNA sequences were manually
aligned in MEGA v4 [55] and identity was verified using
BLASTN [56]. The 10,700-year-old DNA sequences
obtained from pollen were analyzed together with the

Magyari et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:66
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/66

sequences derived from fossil seeds and cone scales at
NHMUS and EBC.
To compare genetic diversity in ancient and extant
spruce populations, we estimated haplotype (H d ) and
nucleotide diversities (π, [57]), average number of
nucleotide differences (k, [58]), weighted average of the
number of differences between sequences from two
populations (K S, averaged with a weight of w = n 1 /(n1
+n2), where n1 and n2 represent population sizes [59]),
and an estimate of genetic differentiation between two
populations (K ST , calculated from K S and the average
number of differences between two sequences in the
total sample [59]). We calculated the statistical support
of K S and K ST values with permutation tests through
1000 randomizations [59]. Gene flow between extant and
ancient populations was estimated using FST [59]. KST
and F ST statistics are identical except for a different
weighting with population sizes [59]. Alignment gaps
were considered as fifth-state characters when calculating
Hd, k, KS, KST and FST values. We performed the calculations in DnaSP v 4 [60].
Phylogenetic relationships between ancient and
extant sequences were analyzed using B/MCMC inference as implemented in MrBayes [61]. Only point
mutations in the form of transversion were taken into
consideration, disregarding also allele length polymorphisms of microsatellite B. In the phylogenetic
analysis we also included two previously obtained 100year-old spruce sequences obtained by Parducci et al.
[7] using primer pair B. The nucleotide substitution
model was selected using the Akaike Information Criterion in ModelTest 3.7 [62]. The analyses were run
(a) on concatenated fragments using all ancient and
extant sequences; (b) on concatenated fragments of all
extant sequences and of the longest ancient sequences
(obtained from cone scales and seeds S8, S9 and S10);
(c) on single fragments on all sequences. Two parallel
tests were run for 20 million generations in the case of
dataset (a) and dataset (b) to achieve convergence. The
determined substitution model was K81uf+I [63] in
both cases, with a proportion I = 0.9667 of invariable
sites for dataset (a) and I = 0.9606 for dataset (b). One
cold and eleven heated chains were used in both analyses, sampling for every 10,000 generations. After discarding 25% of the samples as burnin, all identified
compatible groups were added to consensus trees. The
trees were visualized in FigTree [64].
Substitution model for dataset (c) were TrN for fragment B [55], F81 [65] for fragments D, LF, Li and TL
and HKY for K2i [66], all without Γ-distributed or
invariable loci. The parallel tests were run until achieving convergence (i.e. 5 million generations for fragment
K2i, 16 million generations for Li, and 20 million for B,
D, LF and TL). Sampling was performed in every 10,000

Page 13 of 15

generations. Twenty-five percent of the samples were
discarded as burnin and 50% majority rule consensus
trees were constructed. The trees were visualized in
FigTree.
To map haplotype relationships for fragment B, we also
calculated a median-joining network [67] using the software Network v4.510 (http://www.fluxus-engineering.
com/ accessed on September 25 2009). Two 100-year old
Norway spruce pollen sequences from Parducci et al. [7]
were included in this analysis, and the entire sequence
set was truncated to the common length of 112 bp.
