Molecular epidemiology of salmonid alphavirus
(SAV) subtype 3 in Norway
Mona D Jansen1*, Britt Gjerset2, Ingebjørg Modahl2, Jon Bohlin1

Abstract
Background: Pancreas disease (PD) is a viral fish disease which in recent years has significantly affected Norwegian
salmonid aquaculture. In Norway, the aetiological agent salmonid alphavirus (SAV) has been found to be
represented by the subtype 3 only. SAV subtype 3 has in previous analyses been found to show a lower genetic
divergence than the subtypes found to cause PD in Ireland and Scotland. The aim of this study was to evaluate
the nucleotide (nt) and amino acid divergence and the phylogenetic relationship of 33 recent SAV subtype 3
sequences. The samples from which the sequences were obtained originated from both PD endemic and nonendemic regions in an attempt to investigate agent origin/spread. Multiple samples throughout the seawater
production phase from several salmonid populations were included to investigate genetic variation during an
outbreak. The analyses were mainly based on partial sequences from the E2 gene. For some samples, additional
partial 6 K and nsP3 gene sequences were available.
Results: The nucleotide divergence for all gene fragments ranged from total identity (0.0% divergence) to 0.45%
(1103 nt fragment of E2), 1.11% (451 nt fragment of E2), 0.94% (6 K) and 0.28% (nsP3). This low nucleotide
divergence corresponded well to previous reports on SAV 3 sequences; however the observed divergence for the
short E2 fragment was higher than that previously reported. When compared to SAVH20/03 (AY604235), amino
acid substitutions were detected in all assessed gene fragments however the in vivo significance of these on for
example disease outbreak mortality could not be concluded on. The phylogenetic tree based on the 451 nt E2
fragment showed that the sequences divided into two clusters with low genetic divergence, representing only a
single SAV subtype.
Conclusions: The analysed sequences represented two clusters of a single SAV subtype; however some of the
observed sequence divergence was higher than that previously reported by other researchers. Larger scale, full
length sequence analyses should be instigated to allow further phylogenetic and molecular epidemiology
investigations of SAV subtype 3.

Background
The fish disease known as pancreas disease (PD)
impacts significantly on Norwegian salmonid aquaculture, affecting both Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.)
and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) seawater production[1-3]. In addition, Scottish and Irish Atlantic salmon production has been severely affected since the
emergence of PD in Scotland in 1976 [4,5]. High proportions of the salmonid aquaculture sites have been
continually affected by PD in both Ireland and Scotland;

with Irish figures estimating 95% of examined Irish
farms affected by PD between 1985 and 1989 [6], 62%
affected in 2003 and 86% in 2004[7]. PD emerged in
Norwegian aquaculture in the 1980s [8], followed by a
gradual increase in the number of cases diagnosed
within two western counties (Hordaland and Sogn &
Fjordane) initially constituting the endemic region.
A gradual expansion of this endemic region southwards
(Rogaland, 2004) and northwards (Møre & Romsdal,
2006) resulted in almost the entire south-western coast
constituting an endemic region by the end of 2006. The
first cases outside this region were detected in 2003 in
the two northernmost counties (Finnmark and Troms),
with Troms also affected in 2009. An area within the

northernmost county (Finnmark) may be considered to
constitute a separate endemic area, having had one or
two cases diagnosed each year between 2005 and 2008.
A third, northern county has been affected (Nordland,
2004 and 2008), as well as one county in mid-Norway
(Sør Trøndelag, 2009). The number of Norwegian seawater sites with diagnosed or suspected PD peaked at
109 in 2008, while declined to 75 in 2009 following
industry and government efforts to reduce the impact of
the disease. Although having a serious impact on Norwegian salmonid aquaculture, the proportion of affected
sites in Norway remains lower than that seen in the
Scottish and Irish industries. PD-affected fish generally
show anorexia and lethargy, and develop SAV-associated
lesions particularly in exocrine pancreas and heart- and
skeletal muscle [3]. PD-associated mortality levels vary
greatly, with a range between 0.7 and 26.9% seen in
recently studied Norwegian sites [9].
The aetiological agent was first isolated in Ireland [10]
and was later identified as an alphavirus in the family
Togaviridae [11,12]. The species name salmonid alphavirus (SAV) was suggested [12] and has been adopted by
researchers despite not being accepted by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The SAV
nomenclature will be used throughout this paper. Six
SAV subtypes have been classified so far. In Ireland
SAV subtypes 1, 4, and 6 have been isolated from fish
affected by PD, while Scottish outbreaks have been
caused by SAV subtypes 1, 2, 4, and 5[13,14]. From
Norwegian PD outbreaks, only SAV subtype 3 has been
detected [2,13-15], with a very low level of genetic variance between isolates [13,15]. Although now isolated
from Atlantic salmon in the seawater phase [13]; the
majority of outbreaks due to SAV subtype 2 occurs in
freshwater farms stocking rainbow trout where the
resultant disease has become known as sleeping disease
(SD) [16]. As with other alphaviruses, SAV has a positive sense, single stranded RNA genome [17] of approximately 12 kb [12]. The non-structural proteins (nsP1 to
nsP4) are encoded by the 5’ end and the structural proteins (capsid, envelope glycoproteins (E1 to E3) and
6 K) by the 3’ end [17]. The alphavirus structural protein E2 has been found to be the site of most neutralising epitopes [18]. Salmonid alphaviruses have been
found to be genetically distinct from the other alphaviruses, many of which use arthropod vectors in their
transmission [18]. No vectors have been found to be
included in SAV transmission, and horizontal transmission pathways appear to be most important for the
spread of SAV and PD between seawater populations
[2,7-9,13-15,19-25].
The aim of this study was to evaluate the nucleotide
(nt) and amino acid divergence as well as the phylogenetic relationship of 33 recently obtained SAV subtype 3

sequences originating from both PD endemic and nonendemic regions of Norway. Based on the results, the
possibility of gaining information on agent origin/spread
were to be investigated. Multiple samples throughout
the seawater production phase from several salmonid
populations were included to investigate the presence of
genetic changes during an outbreak. Analyses were to
be based mainly on the partial E2 gene, with additional
partial 6 K and nsP3 gene sequences available from
some samples.

Methods
Sample selection

Samples originated from SAV-positive Atlantic salmon
in the seawater production phase. A total of 33 SAVpositive samples from 12 seawater sites were selected
for partial sequence analysis (Table 1). Multiple samples,
originating from one to three sampling points, were
included from nine sites. The sampling point(s) at each
site varied in time, ranging from two months post seawater transfer to slaughter. As a result, almost the entire
seawater production cycle was represented and gave a
wide range in fish age and weight at time of sampling.
Samples from six sites located within the endemic
region were selected from participants in a cohort study
[9]. Out of these, four sites (sites 1, 3, 4 and 6, Table 1)
were included as they were found SAV-positive earlier
in the seawater phase than the majority of the studied
sites. Further four diagnostic samples from site 3, from
an outbreak investigation on the fish generation put to
sea after the slaughter of the cohort study generation,
were included. Samples from two additional cohort
study sites were included as they represented the minimum (site 5, Table 1) and maximum (site 2, Table 1)
recorded PD-associated mortality. Finally, diagnostic
samples submitted from six sites (sites 7 to 12, Table 1)
in the non-endemic region or the endemic area of Finnmark in December 2003 or between November 2007
and October 2009 were included. All selected sites had
PD diagnosed by SAV detection by real-time RT-PCR
(Rt RT-PCR) being combined with histopathological
changes in accordance with PD (as described by [9]).
RNA extraction and Rt RT-PCR

RNA was extracted from a mixture of heart and midkidney tissue according to the protocol previously
described [9]. A 1762 base pair (bp) region within the
nsP3 gene and a 1871 bp region within the Capsid-E3E2-6 K genes, corresponding to positions 4206-5968 and
8411-10282 of the Norwegian SAVSF21/03 (AY604238)
respectively, were amplified using partial overlapping
sequences. For the Capsid-E3-E2-6 K genes three primer
pairs were used, with two primer pairs used for the nsP3
gene (Table 2). The primer sequence of F1600, R2357,

F2234 and SAV20R originated from work by other
researchers [15]. Briefly, extracted RNA was reverse
transcribed using random primers and SuperScript III
RT (Invitrogen) or OneStep (Qiagen); 2.5 μl cDNA with
0.15 μM of each primer were added in a final PCR reaction volume of 25 μl (HotStar Taq PCR; Qiagen) under
the following conditions: denaturation for 15 minutes at
95°C, followed by 40 amplification cycles of 94°C 30 sec,
59°C 30 sec and 72°C 90 sec, and finally 72°C for
10 min. The RT-PCR products were examined by agar
gel electrophoresis and purified using the ExoSAP-IT
protocol (Usb) prior to sequencing with BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kits (Applied Biosystems).

were obtained from GenBank and included in the phylogenetic analyses (SAVH20/03 (AY602435), SAVH10/02
(AY604236), PD97-N03 (AY604237), SAVSF21/03
(AY604238), SAVF29/03 (DQ122127), SAVT28/03
(DQ122128), SAVN32/04 (DQ122129), SAVSF22/03
(DQ122131)). Additionally, the Irish SAV 1 reference
strain F93-125 (AJ316244) and the French SAV 2 reference strain S49p (AJ316246) were included. The phylogenetic tree shown in this paper was based on the NJ
method and bootstrapped 1000 times. The 33 study
sequences are available from GenBank, with accession
numbers as shown in Table 1.

Results
Sequence analysis

E2 and 6 K fragment

Consensus sequences were generated using Sequencher
(Gene Codes Corporation) or ChromasPro (Technelysium Pty Ltd). All sequences were edited so that the
longest shared and least conserved genetic region was
included in the analysis. All sequence analyses and editing was carried out with the aid of the MEGA4 software
[26]. After editing, 13 sequences contained a 1209 bp
fragment corresponding to position 9049-10257 of the
Norwegian SAV SF21/03 isolate (AY604238), covering a
major part of the E2 gene together with a portion of the
6 K gene. An additional three sequences covered slightly
shorter fragments (SAVMR07-6(2): 1203 bp, position
9049-10251; SAVSF07-4(2): 1170 bp, position 904910218; SAVN03/8(1): 1103 bp, position 9049-10151(E2
only)) (Table 1). Further 17 sequences covered a 451 bp
E2 fragment corresponding to position 9224-9674 (SAV
SF21/03, AY604238), while six sequences covered a 716
bp fragment of the nsP3 region corresponding to position 5183-5898 (SAV SF21/03, AY604238) (Table 1).
The sequences were aligned using both Muscle [27] and
Clustal [28]. Pair wise nucleotide percentage similarity
and divergence was calculated using the program Laglin
(available at http://www.ch.embnet.org/index.html). Phylogenetic trees were generated from the multiple alignments using maximum parsimony (MP), unweighted
pair group method using arithmetic average (UPGMA)
and neighbor joining (NJ) methods, and generated using
both the MEGA4 and Seaview (version 4) software
packages [29]. Sequence data from eight SAV subtype 3

Amongst the 16 sequences covering the 1103 nt E2
fragment, the nucleotide divergence ranged from 0.0%
to 0.45%. When compared to SAVH20/03 (AY604235),
amino acid substitutions were detected in two sequences
(Table 3). In the 106 nt 6 K fragment, a nucleotide
divergence between 0.0% and 0.94% was found with five
sequences showing an amino acid substitution (Table 3).
The 17 sequences covering the shorter, 451 nt E2 fragment had a nucleotide divergence between 0.0% and
1.11%. Amino acid substitutions were observed in 12
sequences (Table 3).
nsP3 fragment

In the six sequences covering the 716 nt partial nsP3
fragment the nucleotide divergence ranged from 0.0%
and 0.28%. Amino acid substitution(s) were detected in
two sequences (Table 3), one of which also showed an
amino acid substitution in the E2 fragment.
Phylogenetic analyses

Both sequence-alignment programs and all three treegeneration methods produced identical results. Three
phylogenetic trees were generated based on the nucleotide sequences of the obtained isolates; E2-6K
sequences, short E2 sequences and nsP3 sequences. All
three trees showed similar topology. The tree covering
the largest number of sequences, 33 sequences covering
the 451 nt (short) E2 fragment, has been included in
this paper (Figure 1). The Irish SAV 1 reference strain

Discussion
The observed nucleotide divergence amongst our study
sequences was generally low, with the short E2
sequences showing the highest divergence (up to 1.1%);
followed closely by the 6 K sequences (up to 0.94%).
The longer sequences showed a lower divergence, with
the long E2 sequences showing a slightly higher divergence (up to 0.45%) than the nsP3 sequences (up to
0.28%). The low divergence amongst our Norwegian
sequences corresponded well with that reported from
previous analyses of SAV subtype 3 sequences; however
the divergence amongst our short E2 sequences was
higher than that previously reported [13,15]. The divergence seen amongst the short E2 and 6 K sequences
may be artificially inflated to some degree by covering
only a relatively small portion of the respective genes,
which may represent the most variable region within
these. On the other hand, it may be that this withinsubtype variance is a true representation of the current
SAV subtype 3 affecting Norwegian aquaculture. The

sequences included in this study were, with one exception, covering August 2006 to October 2009, and originated from affected populations both inside and outside
the endemic region. Our analysis, covering a total of 33
Norwegian SAV subtype 3 sequences, is the largest
reported analysis of Norwegian sequences and covered
more recent sequences than those previously published.
SAV subtypes originating in Ireland and Scotland have
been reported to show higher nucleotide divergence
than SAV subtype 3 (SAV subtypes 1, 2, 4, and 5: E2
fragment divergence 1.2%, 4.8%, 3.4% and 1.7%; nsP3
fragment divergence 0.8%, 6.6%, 3.7% and 4,2%) [13].
RNA viruses are generally rapidly evolving viruses; however alphaviruses, including SAV, appears to be comparatively highly conserved with slower rates of
evolution [30-32]. It is possible that the observed difference in within-subtype nucleotide divergence of SAV
subtype 3 and the other SAV subtypes can be related to
the differences in the proportion of susceptible populations (sites) affected in Norway compared to Ireland and
Scotland. Based on the published reports, PD also
appears to have been present in Scottish aquaculture for
a longer time period. In Norway the proportion of
affected populations remain well below that seen in Ireland and Scotland, were the majority of susceptible

populations are affected. This difference, together with
the historical differences in emergence of PD, may have
resulted in differing evolutionary pressure on the respective SAV subtypes. It is possible that a continued high
impact on Norwegian aquaculture, with or without a
further expansion in geographical distribution, may
result in a gradual increase in the sequence divergence
towards that of other SAV subtypes. Our results support
the theory that there has been only a single introduction
of SAV subtype 3 into Norwegian aquaculture, from
which it has dispersed to reach its current distribution.
The observed amino acid substitutions were partially
the same as those previously reported in SAV subtype 3.
Similar substitutions to those reported at E2 position
204 (R to K) and 206 (S to P) [15] was seen in 11 of our
sequences originating from four sites. In vitro studies
have reported this serine to proline substitution at position 206 to be associated with the appearance of a cytopathic effect [15]. The in vivo significance of this
substitution remains unclear. It was only possible to
obtain reliable data on the PD-associated mortality for
one of the sites where this substitution was seen (site 3,
Table 1: 12.2%). Although higher than the average mortality observed in recently studied Norwegian Atlantic
salmon sites affected by PD [9], the two sequences
obtained from the study site with the highest mortality
(site 2, Table 1: 26.9%) did not show this substitution. It
can not be determined from this study whether any particular amino acid substitutions has had effect on the
disease progression or the mortality of the affected sites,
however this should be investigated further in future
SAV subtype 3 sequence analyses.
The phylogenetic analyses revealed the presence of
two clusters in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1). Due to
the low divergence between the sequences in the upper
and lower clusters of the phylogenetic tree, the use of
the term branch has been avoided. When comparing the
sequences from the upper and lower clusters, a maximum of six nucleotide substitutions and four amino
acid substitutions were detected. The upper cluster consists of 11 study sequences and two GenBank obtained
sequences (previously found to form a separate cluster
to other analysed sequences [15]), which all show the
serine to proline substitution at E2 position 206. This
group consists of sequences from Finnmark (sites 11
and 12, Table 1) and Troms (site 10, Table 1) together
with six sequences from one site in Hordaland (site 3,
Table 1) obtained in 2007 and 2009. The other three
sequences from 2007 and 2009 obtained from this site
(site 3, Table 1) grouped together with the remaining
sequences in the lower cluster. This lower cluster also
contained sequences originating from both the endemic
and the non-endemic regions. One sequence from site 2
(SAVH07-2(2), Table 1) within the lower cluster

Page 7 of 8

separates to a certain degree from the remaining
sequences. This sequence represents the site showing
the highest recorded site mortality level in a recent
cohort study, although no conclusion on the significance
of this can be made. Sequences obtained from each site
generally clustered close together. The exception to this
was sequences from site 3 (Table 1) where sequences
from both outbreaks (2007 and 2009) clustered in both
the upper and the lower clusters. Any epidemiological
interpretation of for example site-specific agent origin
has proven difficult due to the high degree of similarity
seen amongst the studied SAV subtype 3 sequences.

Conclusions
It can be concluded that the analysed sequences represented only a single subtype; however some of the
observed sequence divergence was higher than that previously reported by other researchers. The phylogenetic
analyses confirmed that Norwegian SAV sequences can
be separated into two clusters, although the differences
between the two clusters were limited up to six nucleotides and four amino acids. In the future it would be
desirable with larger scale, full length sequence analyses
in order to enable complete sequence divergence analyses, together with investigations into the effect of particular amino acid substitutions in field outbreaks and
epidemiological investigations on agent origin and
spread.
