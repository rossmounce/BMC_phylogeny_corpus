Abstract
Background: Cultivated strawberry is a hybrid octoploid species (Fragaria xananassa Duchesne ex. Rozier) whose
fruit is highly appreciated due to its organoleptic properties and health benefits. Despite recent studies on the
control of its growth and ripening processes, information about the role played by different hormones on these
processes remains elusive. Further advancement of this knowledge is hampered by the limited sequence
information on genes from this species, despite the abundant information available on genes from the wild diploid
relative Fragaria vesca. However, the diploid species, or one ancestor, only partially contributes to the genome of
the cultivated octoploid. We have produced a collection of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from different cDNA
libraries prepared from different fruit parts and developmental stages. The collection has been analysed and the
sequence information used to explore the involvement of different hormones in fruit developmental processes,
and for the comparison of transcripts in the receptacle of ripe fruits of diploid and octoploid species. The study is
particularly important since the commercial fruit is indeed an enlarged flower receptacle with the true fruits, the
achenes, on the surface and connected through a network of vascular vessels to the central pith.
Results: We have sequenced over 4,500 ESTs from Fragaria xananassa, thus doubling the number of ESTs available
in the GenBank of this species. We then assembled this information together with that available from F. xananassa
resulting a total of 7,096 unigenes. The identification of SSRs and SNPs in many of the ESTs allowed their
conversion into functional molecular markers. The availability of libraries prepared from green growing fruits has
allowed the cloning of cDNAs encoding for genes of auxin, ethylene and brassinosteroid signalling processes,
followed by expression studies in selected fruit parts and developmental stages. In addition, the sequence
information generated in the project, jointly with previous information on sequences from both F. xananassa and
F. vesca, has allowed designing an oligo-based microarray that has been used to compare the transcriptome of the
ripe receptacle of the diploid and octoploid species. Comparison of the transcriptomes, grouping the genes by
biological processes, points to differences being quantitative rather than qualitative.
Conclusions: The present study generates essential knowledge and molecular tools that will be useful in
improving investigations at the molecular level in cultivated strawberry (F. xananassa). This knowledge is likely to
provide useful resources in the ongoing breeding programs. The sequence information has already allowed the
development of molecular markers that have been applied to germplasm characterization and could be eventually
used in QTL analysis. Massive transcription analysis can be of utility to target specific genes to be further studied,
by their involvement in the different plant developmental processes.

Background
Strawberry (Fragaria xananassa Duchesne ex. Rozier) is
one of the most important berry crops in the world; in
2008 its production was approximately 4 million metric
tons [1]. The benefits that strawberry fruit consumption
has on cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and other diseases like aging, obesity, and cancer has been a subject
of increased study over recent years [2]. The strawberry
belongs to the family Rosaceae in the genus Fragaria.
There are four basic fertility groups in Fragaria that are
associated primarily with their ploidy level or chromosome number. The most common native species, F.
vesca L., has 14 chromosomes and it is considered to be
a diploid and proposed as model for the genus [3]. The
most important cultivated strawberry is a perennial and
herbaceous octoploid plant, with fifty six chromosomes
(2n = 8× = 56), that stems from the cross of the octoploids F. virginiana Duchesne from eastern North
America, which was noted for its fine flavour, and F.
chiloensis (L.) Mill. from Chile, noted for its large size
[3]. Numerous varieties of strawberries have been developed in the temperate zones of the world by different
breeding programs.
Strawberry has been considered a non-climacteric
fruit, since there is no concomitant burst of respiration
and production of the hormone ethylene that triggers
the ripening process [4,5]. The berry results from the
development of the flower receptacle that consists of a
pith at the centre, a fleshy cortex, an epidermis, and a
ring of vascular bundles with branches leading to the
achenes, the true fruits. Each achene contains a single
seed and a hard pericarp. The achenes are attached to
the receptacle by vascular strands. When classifying the
strawberry as non-climacteric, no distinction was made
between the receptacle and the achenes. Growth and
ripening of strawberry fruits is an important field of
research, which includes the role played by hormones,
the synthesis of anthocyanins and flavour compounds,
and the cell wall changes occurring during the late
stages of ripening. It is reasonable to think that those
changes that are important for fruit quality, like anthocyanins and flavour content, as well as fruit softening,
mostly rest on the receptacle, whereas hormone control
of the process might be supported by the achenes.
Therefore, the generation of tools to distinguish the
functional roles of these two parts in the growth and
ripening of the whole berry is important.
The hormone auxin, which is supplied by the achenes,
is considered as a key regulator of growth and ripening.
Removal the achenes from the receptacle has different
effects depending on the developmental stage. In the
early green stage it stops receptacle growth, whereas in
the late green and white stages it accelerates ripening

Page 2 of 17

[6]. Interestingly, both effects are suppressed by the exogenous application of auxin restoring normal development [7], [8]. Therefore the role of ethylene in fruit
ripening has been considered as negligible. Recently,
however, it has been reported that the achenes of red
fruits produce ethylene at low concentrations, although
its role in fruit ripening is unclear [5].
Genes related to biochemical processes and metabolites, such as the health promoting metabolites anthocyanin [9] and vitamin C [10], with important roles in
modulating fruit quality have been studied. The aroma,
an important criterion defining strawberry quality is
dependent on more than 360 volatile compounds, many
of them esters, whose synthesis is dependent on the
strawberry alcohol acyltransferase (SAAT) activity
encoded by the FaSAAT gene [11]. Of all the volatiles,
furaneol (HDMF) is the main one responsible of the
aroma of the strawberry fruit [12]. The genes of two
enzymes related to the biosynthesis of HDMF have been
cloned [13], [14]. Due to the importance of the cell wall
in the integrity of the strawberry fruit, genes encoding
for cell wall modifying enzymes have been analysed,
including expansins [15], cellulases [16], beta-galactosidase [17], pectate lyases [18], [19], and pectinmethylesterases [20], [21].
Despite all the previous molecular studies, including a
recent report on metabolic changes during fruit growth
and ripening [22], information on regulatory genes
involved in the strawberry fruit development is still
scarce. The development of genomic tools will, no
doubt, constitute important input that will facilitate
strawberry research. In recent years molecular markers
for this species have been developed [23], [24], and
microarray gene expression experiments during fruit
ripening [25], [26], and in relation to fruit firmness have
been reported [27].
One of the most useful tools in the gene discovery,
and further assignment of function, is the availability of
expressed sequence tags (ESTs). These sequences stem
from cDNA libraries constructed from different tissues
and organs, under different environmental conditions
and stages of development, so they represent a broad set
of expressed genes. ESTs collections have been used in
gene expression studies [28] and to saturate genetic
maps with simple sequence repeats (EST-SSRs) [29] or
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [30]. They also
allow the identification of miRNA precursors and targets
[31], and massive transcriptome analysis using microarrays [32], [33]. At present there are more than 50 million ESTs in the GenBank database, a quarter of which
are from plants. Although fruit crops have been less studied than other plants like Arabidopsis, rice, soybean,
maize or pine, there is a significant number of ESTs

obtained from fruits like tomato [34], grape [35], apple
[36], citrus [37] and melon [38].
In this report we have analysed around 10,000 ESTs
from F. xananassa, 4,600 of which originated from our
own sequencing project, and 5,400 are from the GenBank database. These ESTs have been processed, clustered, annotated and classified into different functional
categories. We have searched for SSRs and SNPs in the
ESTs set in order to evaluate their potential in markerassisted breeding programs. Creation of a gene index
[39] and comparisons with other species enabled the
conclusion that the highest average sequence identity
was with the wild diploid relative F. vesca, up to a value
of 93.27% between sequences of orthologous genes.
Expression studies of selected ESTs using QRT-PCR
allowed investigating on the possible involvement of
hormones like auxin, ethylene, and brassinosteroid in
strawberry fruit ripening. In addition, the set of nonredundant sequences from F. xananassa jointly with an
equivalent number of sequences from F. vesca has been
used to design and perform a microarrays-based expression studies in ripe receptacle of these two species.

cultivated strawberry (F. xananassa) (Table 1). Because
we are interested in fruit ripening, transcripts were
extracted from two ripening stages, green and red, and
two different fruit parts: achenes and receptacle. In addition, transcripts from red fruits were favoured vs. transcripts from green fruits using two different subtraction
procedures (see Methods). Also, sequences were
obtained from transcripts corresponding to genes differentially expressed in ethylene-treated ripe fruits. A webaccessible database containing all the EST sequences,
contigs, and bioinformatic tools for their analysis and
data mining has been created and named FREST http://
fresa.uco.uma.es/srs71. The set was completed with the
dbEST GenBank sequences of F. xananassa. In total,
10,018 sequences were analyzed in the present study
(Table 2).
The raw sequences were processed to remove vector
and adaptor sequences and to discard sequences with
either more than 3% of N or being less than 100 bp in
length. The mean length ranged from 343 to 612 bp,
and the accuracy was evaluated by the frequency of
appearance of an undetermined nucleotide, and changed
from an average of once every 51 to 548 bp (Table 2).
All ESTs (9,790) that passed the quality control were
used for clustering. A total of 5,976 singletons and 1,120
contigs/tentative consensuses were obtained, resulting in
7,096 unigenes/non redundant sequences (Table 2).
Some genes were represented by multiple ESTs as
shown in the Table 3 that includes the contigs with
more than 15 ESTs. In the case of contigs corresponding to metallothionein-like and prunin, with more than
100 ESTs for each one, it is notable that they are overrepresented in the M1 (green receptacle) and M2 (green
achenes) libraries, respectively (Table 3). This is related
to the high expression level of these genes in these fruit
parts, i.e. the receptacle and achenes, at this developmental stage.
Functional annotation

A summary of the different parameters studied in the
annotation of the complete set of unigenes from
F. xananassa is shown in Table 4. The number of chimeras was very low based on the BlastX sequence
searches against the Arabidopsis TAIR Database. Annotation included not only sequence homology comparisons in the GenBank at two e-value cutoff (47.7% of
sequences at e-value < 1e-10, and 1.5% at e-value < 1e100), but also search for domains using InterProScan
(9.2% of sequences), signal peptides using signalP tool
(17.5% of sequences), association to gene ontology (GO)
terms (29.9% of sequences), and numbers of the Enzyme
Commission (EC) (7.2% of sequences). In total, a 56.1%
unigenes were annotated in at least one of the categories
of Table 4. This means that there is still a 43.9% of the

unigenes that remained unknown for any putative
function.
Further, a global analysis by gene ontology (GO)
groups was performed with the Blast2GO software [40].
Blast2GO uses different tools as BlastX and InterProScan to annotate sequences. Figure 1 shows the result of
this analysis. Metabolic processes account for almost
60% of the annotated sequences, including primary,
macromolecule, and cellular metabolic processes.
Remarkable is the dominance of biosynthetic processes
(12.07%) over catabolic processes (4.41%). Proteins
involved in transport are represented by 5.61%, and
other groups of proteins encoded by EST correspond to
a wide variety of biological processes.

Sequence analyses allowed the identification of genes
involved in metabolic and regulatory processes of fruit
ripening

We were interested in the fruit ripening process; therefore the RNA used in the preparation of the cDNA
libraries of the present publication was extracted from
two parts of the berry at two developmental stages, as it
was ripening-enriched by subtraction (Table 1). There
has been previous sequencing project in strawberry
focused on the fruit ripening [25] and we now complete
this previous information. We have performed manual
assignment of F. xananassa unigenes to specific metabolic and signalling pathways (Additional files 1, 2, 3
and 4) providing an exhaustive catalogue of

F. xananassa sequences to be further used in specific
research projects. We summarize in Table 5 the contribution of the new sequences to the information previously available on strawberry genes relevant for the
fruit ripening process. In 8 of the 21 metabolic pathways
the new genes account for more than 50 percent of the
total number of genes known. More interestingly, in
hormone signalling the information on new genes is
very significant, being over 50 percent in 5 of the 6
pathways. In some cases, like brassinosteroid, gibberellins and abscisic acid, there is not previous information
on gene sequences of the corresponding signalling
pathways.

Overall comparison of F. xananassa sequences with other
species. Gene Index

We determined the F. xananassa gene index and related
it to different plant species using the DFCI Gene Index
Database (for species like Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza
sativa or Vitis vinifera), and “ad hoc” gene indices created from the GenBank dbEST (for species like Prunus
persica, Prunus armeniaca, Citrus spp. or Fragaria
vesca). The homology search was performed using the
BlastN tool against non-redundant sequences and true
orthologues were considered as having E values of ≤ 1e20. Results of this analysis are shown in Table 6. The
analysis of these orthologous groups was made from
three different perspectives. Percentage of orthologous
unigenes of each species relative to F. xananassa unigenes, percentage of F. xananassa orthologous unigenes
relative to each species unigenes, and the average identity, after the alignments, of unigenes from each species
with the corresponding F. xananassa orthologous unigene. Values for the first two comparisons (Table 6, columns 2,3) are highly dependent on both the number
and the length of the available sequences for the species
compared. We focus on the values obtained for F. vesca,
the wild diploid species of the same genus of F. xananassa. It is noteworthy that there is a 36.22 percent of
unigenes from cultivated strawberry that show no

putative orthologues to F. vesca unigenes (Table 6, column 3). Thus, although the number of ESTs available
for F. vesca is more than four-fold the number of ESTs
for F. xananassa there are a high number of sequences
of cultivated strawberry that have not been revealed in
the F. vesca sequencing projects.
The average identity was calculated after the alignments of these putative orthologous sequences from different species with the F. xananassa sequences (Table 6,
column 4). As expected, the highest value was for
F. vesca reaching the 93.27 percent, as the genome of
this species probably shares a common ancestor with
F. xananassa [42]. The order of the species in this column reflects the taxonomic proximity with close relatives, having Rosa hybrid, Prunus and Malus the highest
values. However, this is not an analysis of phylogeny,

but the result of the multiple alignments of sequences
available in the databases for the different species.
Therefore, it is not possible to gain taxonomic information from the results here presented on species out of
the Rosaceae family (Table 6, column 4)
Actual polymorphisms evaluation inside the EST
collection

Microsatellites, or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), are
stretches of DNA consisting of tandem repeated short
units of 1-6 base pairs in length. The uniqueness and
the value of microsatellites as molecular markers arise
from their multiallelic nature, co dominant inheritance,
relative abundance, extensive genome coverage and simple detection by PCR. Three hundred eighty three
(4.64%) SSRs were identified in 329 of the 7.096

unigenes. Fifty sequences contained more than 1 SSR
and 47 of them with less than 100 bp between 2 consecutive SSRs. The frequency of SSR was one every 9.1 kb
of the sequence. As shown in Table 7, dinucleotides are
the most frequent motifs (47.3%), followed by trinucleotides (45.9%). Other nucleotide combinations are poorly
represented (3.9% tetranucleotides, 2.9% pentanucleotides). Most of the SSRs found were on the 5’ non-coding regions upstream of putative ORFs, close to the
initial ATG. A total of 102 SSRs have been amplified
and 10 have already been used for studies of F. xananassa varieties and Fragaria species [24].

The number of di-, tri-, tetra and pentanucleotides repeats identified in the
strawberry database is shown for the complete set of putative SSRs (pSSRs)

Of the 1,120 contigs generated in the present study,
242 contained a minimum of two alleles, 128 of them
with potential SNPs. In these contigs the changes corresponded to 636 potential SNPs and 148 indels. The final
number of good quality true-SNPs was 372, 192 of them
were transitions, 124 were transversions, 2 were tri-allelic polymorphisms, and 54 were indels. The frequency
of SNP was one every 256 bp, and a mean value of 2.9
SNPs per contig.

in fruits. For auxin we selected genes encoding ARF
(auxin response factor) proteins, which are transcription
factors controlling the expression of auxin-induced
genes [43]. Regarding ethylene, we studied genes encoding ethylene response transcription factors (ERF) that
belong to the large AP2/ERF family regulating ethyleneresponsive genes [44]. Patterns of the expression of
these genes in achenes and receptacle at three developmental stages are shown in Figure 2(A, B). Values of
expression by qRT-PCR are relative for each gene,
therefore is not possible to have information on absolute
values of expression of different genes. However, it is
apparent that each gene presents a tissue- and developmental-specific expression pattern with significant differences among samples (Figure 2). Thus, transcriptional
activity of FaARF1 is highest in red receptacle whereas
for FaARF2 the highest level of transcripts is detected in
white receptacle. For the FaERF genes high and significant changes occur for FaERF1 and FaERF3, having the
first the highest value in green achenes and the second

in green receptacle. A more conspicuous case is brassinosteroids, whose involvement in fruit developmental
processes has been studied in only a few species [45],
[46]. We have identified ESTs homologous to the receptor and two components of the signalling pathway
(FaBRI1, FaBRZ1, FaBIN2) (Table 9). Their expression
also varies with the fruit part, achene or receptacle, and
the developmental stage (Figure 2C). Highest changes
occur for the receptor FaBRI1 whose expression is
higher in receptacle and clearly increases with ripening
Transcript analysis in red receptacle of F. xananassa and
F. vesca

Utility of the EST collection from F. xananassa was
finally tested in transcriptomic studies. One set of 6,349
Fragaria xananassa non redundant sequences here
reported, and another set of 7,734 Fragaria vesca non
redundant sequences available in the GenBank, were
used to design an oligo-based microarray for the expression studies. Fruit characteristics of the cultivated F.
xananassa are very different from the F. vesca in terms
of size, colour, softness and volatiles [3]. These differences have their origin in the receptacle tissue and
become more apparent at the ripe stage. Therefore, analysis of transcripts was performed in the receptacle of
ripe fruits from cultivated strawberry F. xananassa (cv.
Camarosa) and F. vesca. Expression values are provided
in the Additional File 5. Prior to the analysis of the
results, redundancy between the two sets of sequences
was determined. A blastN between both datasets with
an e-value < 1e-100, and a similarity percentage > 90%
were used as discriminatory criteria. Global analysis was
restricted to genes with very different expression level in
the two species. Thus, Figure 3 shows the results of the
genes that were over 4-fold up- (Figure 3A, 892 genes)
and down-regulated (Figure 3B, 269 genes) in F. xananassa relative to F. vesca, analyzed by GO terms, when
differences were statistically significant (p value ≤ 0.1).
in general distribution of genes between categories of
up- and down-regulated genes was similar between
them, and also to the distribution in the F. xananassa
EST collection here analyzed (Figure 1). However, there
are two categories where differences, albeit minor,
appear meaningful. The category “response to stress”
was more abundant among the genes up-regulated in
F. vesca (13.1%) in comparison to those up-regulated in
F. xananassa (4.46%). Most of these genes correspond
to heat shock proteins (Table 10), which have been
reported to play a role not only in thermo tolerance but
also in plant development [47], [48]. A second difference
was observed in the category of “regulation of cellular
processes” that was more highly represented among the
genes up-regulated in F. xananassa. Detailed analysis of
the genes reveals that most of them encode for proteins

and as processed foods. However, there have been only
limited genetic and genomic resources developed in this
species due to its growing characteristics and the inherent difficulty of working with an octoploid. Despite this,
genetic and genomic information is slowly appearing
and recently the first genetic map has been reported
[42]. In this work we analyzed more than 10,000 ESTs
from F. xananassa, assembled in more than 7,000 unigenes. Half of these sequences proceeded from our own
sequencing project; a second set of sequences was
obtained from the GenBank dbEST Database.
Regarding the new sequences reported here it is worth
emphasizing that they proceed from different fruit parts
(achenes and receptacle), at different developmental
stages (green and red fruit), and after hormone treatment (ethylene). In addition to the genetic characteristics, difficulties analyzing strawberry fruit growth and
ripening arise from the fact that the commercial fruit is
not a true fruit but includes an engrossed flower receptacle with the true fruits, the achenes, attached on its
surface. Moreover, the development pattern of these two
parts of the commercial fruit is not synchronous in that
the achenes reach their mature stage much earlier than
receptacle [49] Thus, the sequence information provided

in this report specific for achenes and receptacle
libraries is highly valuable. This is highlighted by the
high number of ESTs encoding prunins in the achene
library that is absent in the receptacle library. Similarly
a large number of ESTs encoding metallothioneins were
identified in the receptacle library with a low number of
ESTs in the achene library. Prunins are known as the
globulins of the genus Prunus, which comprise the main
family of storage proteins synthesized in seeds during
embryogenesis [50]. Metallothioneins belong to a family
of cysteine-rich, low molecular weight proteins that
have the capacity to bind metals through the thiol
group of the cysteine residues, which represent nearly
30% of their amino acidic residues. These proteins have
been shown to be involved in metal scavenging and
detoxification [51], as well as in biotic and abiotic plant
responses [52], [53]. Their high abundance in green
receptacle suggests their important role in this organ.

The gene index analysis of the sequences reflected the
genetic proximity of strawberry with other species of
Rosaceae. Effectively, Fragaria sp. belongs to the Rosaceae family that includes apple, peach and apricot, and
to the Rosaceae supertribe [54] that includes rose. The
highest identity in the alignment was with F. vesca, from
the same genus, followed by Rosa hybrida from the
same supertribe, and Prunus and Malus from the same
family. Previous studies on genomic resources of Fragaria and Rosa have also shown a high level of genetic
proximity [54], [55]. There are more than 50.000 ESTs
available from the diploid F. vesca [55] that has been
proposed as a model plant for genomic studies. Recent
studies have predicted approximately 200 Mb for its
genome size [56] which might facilitate its complete
sequencing. However, cultivated strawberry is an octoploid species with at least two genomes involved in its
origin; one is thought to be an ancestor of F. vesca or F.
manchurica, and the other an ancestor of F. iinumae, or
potentially other species [42].
Overall comparison between the F. vesca and F. xananassa has revealed that only 32.42% of the diploid species had a corresponding putative orthologous gene in
the octoploid. A possible explanation for this low value
would be that the F. vesca derived subgenome is
silenced in F. xananassa, as it has been previously
described for specific genes [57], or even that the donor
subgenome could be an ancestor or F. vesca. However,
these hypothesis needs further studies since it could also
be just a consequence of the different precedence of the
EST sequences used in this comparison, mostly from
plantlets in F. vesca and from fruits in F. xananassa. In
any case, cultivated strawberry still represents a great
potential source of alleles that might be important for
selected traits, since in other species it has been shown
that polyploidization is accompanied by changes in the
gene expression, and accordingly in phenotypic variation
[58].
In addition, the strawberry fruit produces some metabolites that are not found in other fruit models, such as
tomato. These aspects make the ESTs information provided here valuable since it might eventually be used to
probe for specific genes in other species, some of them
closely related as some berries of the Rubus genus, like
raspberry and blackberry that are classified in the same
supertribe of Rosoideae as Fragaria [54].
SSRs derived from ESTs have been used as functional
markers in the generation of maps and in breeding programs. In strawberry, we have previously used some of
these markers to study genetic diversity within the species [59]. Based on the high level of identity found with
corresponding genes of genetically close species, like
those of the Rosaceae family, we foresee their transferability to these species, as other authors have shown

Page 12 of 17

[60], [61]. For this purpose, it is important to indicate
that strawberry comparative map reveals a high level of
co-linearity between diploid and octoploid Fragaria species [42]. For other species of the Rosaceae family this
transferability deserves to be evaluated.
The function played by hormones in the development
of strawberry fruits is still an unresolved question. Considered as a non-climacteric fruit, the main role has
been attributed to the auxin synthesized in the achenes
[62]. A search for genes involved in hormones response
was performed. Auxin response factors (ARF) are transcription factors acting on the signalling pathway of this
hormone [63]. We have unequivocally identified two of
them in the strawberry ESTs Database, FaARF1 and
FaARF3. For the FaARF1, the highest homology corresponds to a gene expressed in tomato [64], and to the
Arabidopsis ARF1 gene [65]. FaARF3 has high homology
to both ARF3 genes from tomato and Arabidopsis. The
strawberry gene FaARF3 is mostly expressed in the
receptacle at the white stage. At this stage the content
of auxin is decreasing but still high in comparison to
red fruits [8], [62], and cell expansion determines the
final size of the receptacle.
The ethylene binding factors (ERF) constitute a family
of transcription factors that were identified by their
capacity to bind ethylene-responsive elements (ERE)
present as cis-sequences in the ethylene-inducible genes.
Further studies revealed that they act as transcriptional
activators or repressors of GCC Box-mediated gene
expression [44]. In tomato fruits it has been reported
that some of them participate in the signalling pathway
initiated by ethylene during the ripening of the fruits
[32]. In the ESTs collection we have identified three
putative ERFs (FaERF1, FaERF2, FaERF3) proceeding
from the library prepared from the achenes, and this is
consistent with the finding that achenes produced four
to ten-fold more ethylene than fruit epidermal peels [5].
Both FaERF1 and FaERF3 have highest expression at
the green stage and show high homology with SlERF2
[66] and MdERF1 [67], respectively, involved in tomato
and apple fruit ripening. The corresponding Arabidopsis
genes for FaEFR1 and FaERF3 belong to the subfamily
B-2 (Group VII) [68]. In contrast, the Arabidopsis gene
homologous to FaERF2, which shows minor variation, is
classified in the subfamily B-3 (Group IX) [68]. The
genes in group IX have often been linked in defensive
gene expression in response to pathogen infection.
In strawberry there is no information on the content
of active brassinosteroid in the ripening fruit. The preferential expression of FaBRI1 in red receptacle suggests
an increased concentration of this hormone in this tissue at later stages of ripening. However, a relationship
between FaBRI1 expression and an increased concentration is not direct since it is needed to know the

Bombarely et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:503
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/503

expression of other important elements in the brassinosteroid signalling pathway such as BAK1 (BRI1 associated
receptor kinase) and BKI1 (inhibitor of the association
of BRI1 and BAK1) [69]. BZR1 is a transcription factor
[70] whose cell location depends on its phosphorylation
status, mainly controlled by BIN2 [71]. When BZR1 is
phosphorylated goes to the nucleus where induces the
expression of brassinosteroid dependent genes. Expression of genes FaBZR and FaBIN2 occurs in achenes and
receptacle at all stages, but the expression ratio FaBZR/
FaBIN2 is higher in the white achene and lower in
white receptacle. These expression patterns must be
interpreted under the light of the interaction of the
encoded proteins as above indicated. In summary, the
functional relevance of all these expression studies in
terms of the role of hormones in fruit ripening is limited. However, they illustrate the possibility of using the
sequence information here reported to initiate the molecular dissection the problem with gene-specific tools.
The database here reported allowed the comparison of
the transcriptome in the ripe receptacle of F. xananassa
(cv. Camarosa) and the diploid F. vesca. As expected,
there are very specific changes in genes related to secondary metabolism (see Additional file 6). However, global analysis revealed that differences in the
transcriptomes being more quantitative than qualitative i.
e. supported by activation/depletion rather than by gain/
loss of biological processes. The two minor differences
found in “response to stress”, up-regulated in F. vesca,
and “regulation of cellular processes”, up-regulated in F.
xananassa, are probably related to the domestication of
the species. Natural environment of the wild F. vesca is
more cold climate and high altitude than F. xananassa
[3], and it is probable that its cultivation under temperate
conditions triggers the heat stress response. On the other
hand, is not surprising that hormone signalling pathways
are more efficient in F. xananassa especially those related
to auxin action since it has been reported that increasing
auxin content in both F. xananassa and F. vesca has the
effect of increasing weight and size of fruits [72]. The
relevance of these changes here reported deserves further
investigation by a deep study of specific genes. This is
currently under progress.

Conclusions
We anticipate that the generation of this strawberry
gene dataset will be important in further genomic studies of this species. It doubled the number of ESTs
available for this species and combined and analysed all
the information presently available for the strawberry.
The analysis of the information reported and gathered
in relation to the cultivated strawberry when compared
with the available information on the wild strawberry,
the diploid Fragaria vesca, is valuable to establish their

Page 13 of 17

genetic relationship. It is an essential source of information for the study of the expression of genes, either by
QRT-PCR or by microarray. It will also allow the establishment of few tools for the analysis of metabolic and
hormone signalling pathways playing a role in the different developmental processes of this species.

Methods
Plant material

Strawberry plants (F. xananassa Duchesne ex. Rozier)
were grown under field conditions in Huelva, in the
southwest of Spain. The fruits were sampled at selected
developmental stages that we previously established
[10]. For the expression studies samples were from
receptacle and achenes, separately, from stages of green
fruit (green receptacle and green achenes); white fruits:
white receptacle and green achenes; and red fruits: red
receptacle and brown achenes, of the cultivar Camarosa.
The cDNA libraries were prepared from different tissues
of the strawberry fruits at various developmental stages.
The M1 and M2 libraries were prepared from receptacle
and achenes, respectively, of fruits of the cultivar Carisma at the green stage. The C1, and C2, and C3
libraries were prepared from fruits of the cultivar
Chandler, being C1 and C3 subtractive libraries.
Whereas libraries C1 and C2 were prepared from whole
fruits, the C2 library was only from receptacle. The L1
library was prepared from red fruits (receptacle and
achenes) of the cultivar Elsanta treated with ethylene.
In the microarray studies, plants of F. xananassa (cv.
Camarosa) and F. vesca were cultivated in a greenhouse
under natural light conditions in Churriana (Málaga,
Spain), and fruits of the two species were sampled during their overlapping growing season.
Construction of cDNA libraries and EST sequencing

For the M1 and M2 libraries achenes were removed from
fruits at the green stage and total RNA was extracted
separately from the remaining receptacle and the
achenes. Total RNA isolation was performed as previously described [73]. Poly(A+) mRNA was purified
from total RNA using the ‘PolyAtract_mRNA Isolation
Systems’ kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction
(Promega). This poly(A+) RNA was used for the construction of the directional cDNA library in the Lambda
ZAP Express phage using the ‘ZAP Express_ cDNA
Synthesis Kit’,’Gigapack_ III Gold Cloning Kit’, and
‘Gigapack_ III GoldPackaging Extract’ kits according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).
The C1 subtractive library (red stage versus green
stage) was generated from the whole fruit (receptacle and
achenes) as previously described [74]. The C2 library was
prepared from RNA extracted from whole red strawberry
fruits [16]. The C3 library was prepared based in the

Bombarely et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:503
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/503

suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) [75]. The
subtraction (red stage versus green stage) was normalized
and prepared, only from receptacle tissue, according the
Clontech PCR-Select cDNA Subtraction Kit (BD Biosciences) system. For the L1 library ripe strawberry fruits
were exposed to a constant stream of air containing 50
vpm ethylene. RNA was extracted after 2, 4, 24, 48 and
72 hours and also used in a suppressed subtractive hybridisation (SSH, Clontech Inc.) protocol.
Sequencing of the M1 and M2 libraries was performed
from the 5’-end of the inserts using the M13 reverse primer by a custom service (Sistemas Genómicos S.L.,
Spain). The C1, C2, and C3 libraries were sequenced in
an ABI PRISM™ 310 de Perkin Elmer by the Central
Services of the Universidad de Córdoba. Primers used
were T3, T7, M13 forward y M13 reverse when cloned
in pBSII, and sp6 when cloned in pGEM-T.

Functional annotation was performed using the package Blast2Go [40]. Tools of this package were used for
BlastX (using GenBank nr as database and 1e-10 as
initial cutoff e-value), InterProScan (for protein domain
search and signal peptide prediction) and enzyme code
and GO term mapping. The functional category analysis
was done over biological process GO term distribution
at a cutoff level of 3.
The datasets for the comparison with other species
were made in the following way: The sequences were
downloaded from the dbEST database in GenBank.
These sequences were cleaned and clustered in the
same way as the strawberry sequences. The homology
search between strawberry and these species were made
with the program Blastall, and subprogram TblastX,
with a threshold e-value of 1e-20.
SSRs and SNPs

Bioinformatics

The strawberry EST sequences for the libraries CO3,
CO8 and SGBL were obtained from the dbEST database
from GenBank. Libraries with less than 100 sequences
were placed in the group SGBL (Small GenBank
libraries).
EST sequences were cleaned with the seqclean software
[41] using the default parameters. As dataset for fragments of vectors and adaptors the Univec and Univec_core from NCBI were used. To remove contaminants,
ColiBank95, an Escherichia coli genome dataset from
NCBI, was used. The program was repetitively applied to
the sequences in FASTA format until no sequence was
excluded. Clustering and creation of the consensus
sequences were performed through the TGICL pipeline
[41] with the programs Megablast for clustering and
Cap3 for the consensus sequences. Variations on the
default parameters in Megablast revealed that the percentage of minimum identity was the only determinant on
the final number of clusters. Thus, the parameters established for clustering were: 95 percent for the minimum
identity, 40 bp length for the minimum overlapping
region, and 20 bp length for maximum non-overlapping
extremes. Those sequences from a cluster allowing the
establishment of a consensus sequence were included in
a contig. In this process, we defined singlets as clustered
sequences that could not be included in a consensus
sequence and singletons as sequences that were not
grouped in a cluster. The unigenes were then the sum of
singletons, singlets, and contigs.
The chimera analysis was performed parsing the
results of the BlastX of the 5’ and 3’ extremes (300 nt)
of each unigene using TAIR 8 as blast database. Unigenes that presented different blast hits for each
extreme not related between them were annotated as
putative chimeras.

The identification and localization of SSRs was accomplished by PERL5 scripts MISA [76]. SSRs were only considered when they contained motifs that were between
two and five nucleotides in size and with 2, 3, 4 and 5
repeats for di- tri-tetra- and pentanucleotides, respectively. For SNP location we have used the pipeline QualitySNP [77] that develops an algorithm to detect reliable
SNPs and insertions/deletions in EST data, from diploid
and polyploid species. The default parameters were used,
i.e. CAP3 similarity of overlap 95%, minimum size of
alleles of each SNP 2, length of the low quality region at
the 5’ end of sequence 30 nucleotides, similarity on one
polymorphic site 0.75, similarity on all polymorphic ie
sites 0.8, low quality region of 3’ side 0.2 (20% of the
whole sequence). The weight value of the low quality
region 0.5 and the minimal confidence score 2. 2.
Expression studies

Total RNA was extracted from F. xananassa fruits, from
receptacle and achenes separatetly, according to the
method described by [74]. Two biological and three technical replicates of each were performed for every sample.
The RT reaction was done using iScript ™cDNA Synthesis
Kit (Bio-Rad, http://www.bio-rad.com) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Expression was analysed by
real-time quantitative RT-PCR using iQ™SYBR® Green
Supermix sample in an iCycler detection system (Bio-Rad,
http://www.bio-rad.com according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, and gene-specific primers. The results
obtained were normalized against FaRIB413 expression
that was reported to be constitutive [78]. The primers used
in the PCR reactions are indicated in Additional File 6.
Microarray analysis

Oligo (60 mer length) design for expression analysis was
performed by NimbleGen Systems Inc. from 6,349 non

Bombarely et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:503
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/503

redundant sequences of F. xananassa http://fresa.uco.
uma.es/srs71 and 7,734 non redundant sequences of
F. vesca (GenBank). A minimum of 7-10 oligo were
printed per probe and three blocks were printed per
dataset. Samples corresponding to two growing seasons
were prepared as high quality double-stranded cDNA
which were synthesized from total RNA, extracted from
the receptacle of ripe fruit as above described, following
the protocol described in the Invitrogen’s SuperScript™
Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit. Samples labeling,
hybridization with three probes per target, and data normalization was performed by NimbleGen Systems Inc.
according to the procedures described in the expression
analysis section http://www.nimblegen.com/.
Data analysis of the microarrays expression studies
was performed with the software for gene expression
analysis ArrayStar (DNASTAR). The t-test and FDR
(Benjamini-Hochberg) for multiple testing corrections
were used with a confidence p-value < 0.1, to identify
statistically significant differences.
The redundancy between probes of the two species
were analysed using BlastN with cutoff value < 1e-100
and a similarity percentage > 90%.
