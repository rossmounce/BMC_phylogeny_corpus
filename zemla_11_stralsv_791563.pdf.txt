StralSV: assessment of sequence variability within
similar 3D structures and application to polio
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase

Abstract
Background: Most of the currently used methods for protein function prediction rely on sequence-based
comparisons between a query protein and those for which a functional annotation is provided. A serious limitation
of sequence similarity-based approaches for identifying residue conservation among proteins is the low confidence
in assigning residue-residue correspondences among proteins when the level of sequence identity between the
compared proteins is poor. Multiple sequence alignment methods are more satisfactory–still, they cannot provide
reliable results at low levels of sequence identity. Our goal in the current work was to develop an algorithm that
could help overcome these difficulties by facilitating the identification of structurally (and possibly functionally)
relevant residue-residue correspondences between compared protein structures.
Results: Here we present StralSV (structure-alignment sequence variability), a new algorithm for detecting closely
related structure fragments and quantifying residue frequency from tight local structure alignments. We apply
StralSV in a study of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of poliovirus, and we demonstrate that the algorithm
can be used to determine regions of the protein that are relatively unique, or that share structural similarity with
proteins that would be considered distantly related. By quantifying residue frequencies among many residueresidue pairs extracted from local structural alignments, one can infer potential structural or functional importance
of specific residues that are determined to be highly conserved or that deviate from a consensus. We further
demonstrate that considerable detailed structural and phylogenetic information can be derived from StralSV
analyses.
Conclusions: StralSV is a new structure-based algorithm for identifying and aligning structure fragments that have
similarity to a reference protein. StralSV analysis can be used to quantify residue-residue correspondences and
identify residues that may be of particular structural or functional importance, as well as unusual or unexpected
residues at a given sequence position. StralSV is provided as a web service at http://proteinmodel.org/AS2TS/

Background
Accurate sequence alignments between related proteins
are important for many bioinformatics applications that
involve comparative analysis. Derived from calculated
alignments, residue-residue correspondences allow construction of sequence motifs and profiles important in
building homology models or in predicting protein functions. Most of the currently used methods for protein

function prediction rely on sequence-based comparisons
between a query protein and those for which a functional
annotation is provided. A serious limitation of sequence
similarity-based approaches for identifying residue conservation among proteins is the lack of, or very low, confidence in assigning residue-residue correspondences
among proteins when the level of sequence identity
between the compared proteins is poor. Indeed, it was
shown by Rost [1] that more than 95% of all pair-wise
alignments occurring in the so-called twilight zone (2035% sequence identity) may be incorrect [2]. Multiple
sequence alignment methods are more satisfactory–still,

they cannot provide reliable results at low levels of
sequence identity, especially if the number of available closely related proteins is small (i.e., when the protein family
has rather few members, or the list of related proteins that
has been identified is short).
Having 3D structural information for a given protein
can be especially useful in deriving functional annotation
[3]. Structure comparison algorithms provide much
higher confidence in assignment of residue-residue correspondences than do sequence-based algorithms. Nevertheless even calculated structural alignments may be
inaccurate: for some compared proteins, or regions
therein, more than one possible superposition can reasonably be reported, and it may be difficult to decide
which alignment is most satisfactory [4,5]. Rigid body
structural superpositions on the chain level have limitations when comparing multi-domain proteins with different conformations between domains. Comparisons on
the domain level may yield better results, but splitting of
structures into domains can be problematic, and there is
no reliable method that can do this automatically. Even
within compared structural domains, significant deviations can be observed in some loop regions, or due to
large insertions or different conformations of structural
motifs, all of which can significantly affect detection of
structural residue-residue correspondences when rigid
body approaches are used for alignment calculations.
Several algorithms have been proposed to facilitate flexible protein structure alignment calculations [6-8], but
the complexity of such calculations remains a challenging
development goal. Another difficulty in identifying similar regions in compared protein structures lies in the possibility that analogous regions in structurally related
proteins may display differences in sequential ordering of
the motifs due to circular permutations or convergent
evolution [9,10]. The majority of the existing flexible protein structure alignment algorithms report only sequential alignments, and there are very few (with varying
levels of success) that can detect and align structures
between which there are differences in the ordering of
their structure motifs [11-13].
The accuracy of calculated structural alignments can
also depend on the nature of compared structural models. The atomic coordinates obtained from experimentally solved structures (x-ray crystallography or nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy) are always associated
with some degree of uncertainty resulting from experimental errors from the intrinsic flexibility of the proteins or from atom vibrations [14]. Such structural
deviations may sometimes significantly affect the calculated alignments and lead to incorrect conclusions about
sequence motifs, profiles, or possible residue substitutions within analyzed functional regions in proteins. The
accuracy of calculated residue-residue correspondences

can be improved by refinement methods that evaluate
results produced by different structure-based alignment
programs or explore sequence-based alignments using,
for example, the Conserved Domain Database (CDD) as
a set of reference alignments [15].
Our goal in the current work was to develop an algorithm that could address these difficulties and facilitate
the identification of structurally (and possibly functionally) relevant residue-residue correspondences between
compared protein structures. Our approach is to first
detect similar structural motifs, and consequently derive
structure-based alignments from the calculated local
superpositions of corresponding similar regions. Our
StralSV algorithm detects structurally similar regions
within a given pair of protein structures, and reports residue-residue correspondences only from those local
regions that are contained within a larger, similar structural context. When for a given reference structure a
structure-based search is performed on a set of proteins
from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), StralSV identifies all
structurally similar fragments from that set, evaluates the
calculated structure-based alignments between the query
(reference) motif (designated “segment” in this work) and
the detected structure fragments, and quantifies the
observed sequence variability at each residue position on
the query structure. Here we describe how the StralSV
algorithm works, and we apply StralSV in a study of the
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of poliovirus.

Methods
Description of the StralSV algorithm

StralSV is an algorithm that identifies protein structural
fragments having a 3D structure similar to that of a query
structure, performs structure-based alignments between
the query and the fragments, and quantifies at each position along the query structure the sequence variability
represented among the selected fragments relative to the
query. StralSV takes as input a query structure of interest,
a database of protein structures, and various parameters
(discussed below) that control the selection of fragments
from the database and the sequence variability calculations. Figure 1 illustrates the steps in the algorithm. The
algorithm uses a sliding-window approach for breaking
the query structure into overlapping segments, each of
which is independently used to identify from the input
database protein structure fragments with 3D similarity. A
recommended (default) window_size parameter is set to
90 amino acids in length, although an arbitrary length can
be chosen. The query structure is thus split into overlapping segments of length window_size; overlaps are by
default 1/2 the length of the window_size. A final segment
is taken one window_size in length extending from the
C-terminus to ensure that all portions of the query structure are represented within a segment of exactly the

window_size. Each so-calculated query segment is then
compared to all protein structures in the database using
the LGA (local-global alignment) code [16] to identify
structure fragments with sufficient structure similarity to
the query segment. The LGA_S score is used to evaluate
structure similarity between a query segment and detected
similar fragments. Calculated LGA_S scores range from
0% to 100% and reflect a percentage of residues from the
query segment that are identified as structurally aligned
with a given similar fragment. In the StralSV algorithm, a
value of LGA_S of at least 50% is used as a cutoff to
ensure that there is sufficient structural similarity between
the segment and the fragment over at least half the length
of the segment. LGA’s distance cutoff parameter determines the maximum allowable distance between alpha
carbons (Ca) of superimposed amino acids within a calculated alignment; typically this parameter is set to 4.0 Å,
and this default is used for StralSV calculations with window_size values of 90 residues. Thus, fragments with sufficient structure similarity to the query segment are
identified. Each fragment is then evaluated to determine
the tightness of its alignment to the query segment.
The criteria for tight structure similarities in local
regions (spans), described by Zemla et al. [17], are used

to identify ranges within the alignment that have tight
local superpositions. Each residue-residue pair from the
alignment (closest superimposed residues from the query
segment and database fragment) is assigned a score by
calculating the local RMSD (root mean square deviation)
among the surrounding residue-residue pairs. A continuous set of at least three residue-residue pairs that fulfil
the RMSD cutoff of 0.5 Å comprises a span. A desired
size of a calculated span (span_size; shortest acceptable
tight local alignment without gaps) is used as an input
parameter to StralSV, and is typically specified as 3, 5, or
7, but can be of arbitrary length. Our previous experience
[17], suggests that 5 is a reasonable minimum length
over which to impose a tight alignment; 3 is the minimum value for span_size that is meaningful (since any 2
Ca atoms can be perfectly aligned), and 7 imposes stringency that tends to eliminate capture of some related
(desired) structure fragments. For the work reported here
we selected a minimum span length of 5 (span_size = 5).
From each alignment is extracted a set of spans. All
alignments that contain at least one span of length no
less than the specified minimum span length are deemed
“qualified hits”. (For an illustration of a “span”, see additional file 1: StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Figure 1.docx.) All

residue-residue pairs that are contained within a span’s
alignment are used to calculate the sequence variability
data at the corresponding position in the query structure.
Note that not all residues from calculated structure alignments contribute to the variability statistics at a given
position in the query segment; regions in which the local
RMSD distances between corresponding residues exceed
0.5 Å induce breakpoints between spans. Also, because
the algorithm uses overlapping segments, duplications
are appropriately factored out in calculating the sequence
variability.
A frequency matrix (Table 1) is constructed for each
position in the query structure by tallying the frequency
at which each amino-acid (the 20 standard amino acids
plus ‘X’, corresponding to unusual or modified residues)
is observed within the spans. From this matrix are
extracted statistics describing the number of positional
hits (residue-residue correspondences contributing
sequence variability data) per position and a list of residues observed at each position, ordered by frequency of
occurrence. These statistics are used to construct a
variability profile (Table 2), which can be used to identify positions at which there is relatively high or low
sequence variability in structure context. The sample
profile given in Table 2 shows the observed residues for
positions 229 through 269 for polio RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase (RdRp) run as the query protein
against the complete PDB database (released on November 24, 2009).
Selection of parameters for StralSV using benchmark
structure set

To illustrate the StralSV algorithm, we selected a minimum span length of 5 and conducted analyses on poliovirus RdRp because poliovirus has been extensively
studied and its polymerase is a member of a widely distributed protein family. In analyzing poliovirus RdRp,
part of our effort involved determining suitable parameters for window_size and distance_cutoff. As window_size is increased, the stringency with which similar
structure fragments are selected is increased, due to the
greater structural context that is provided by the query
segment. As distance cutoff is increased, that stringency
is reduced, because more laxity in the alignment is
allowed. Thus, for larger window_size values, a larger
distance cutoff should be applied in order for the algorithm to not eliminate related structure fragments that
have local structural deviations with respect to the
query segment. Likewise, as the window size is
decreased, the distance cutoff should be reduced as well,
to prevent capture of many small, less related structure
fragments. To determine what combinations of window_size and distance_cutoff values would provide com-

parable results, we performed several benchmark tests
involving various structure libraries (e.g., complete PDB,
PDB-select 40, ASTRAL40) and input parameters (data
not shown). The results from one such test involving
the capture of structure fragments from a benchmark
data set containing 38 polymerase structures plus more
than 1000 other structures randomly selected from the
PDB is presented in Figure 2. Suitable parameters input
to StralSV were expected to capture only structurally
related fragments (i.e., the polymerases), whereas overly
stringent parameters were expected to yield result sets
lacking at least some of the polymerase fragments, and
low stringency parameters were expected to capture less
related fragments. In this way, we examined the dependency between window_size and distance_cutoff values
to determine optimal (for the current study) parameter
settings, and help define default parameter settings for
StralSV.
We conducted a test whereby window_size and distance_cutoff parameters were varied from 20 to 150 and
1.0Å to 6.5Å, respectively (Figure 2). We ran StralSV
using each window_size/distance_cutoff combination for
all query (poliovirus RdRp) segments enclosing residue
G64. We selected a region in the N-terminal portion of
the protein upon which to focus this exercise. The region
defined by residues 1-140 tended to be structurally
unique, but at the same time contained a variety of well
defined secondary structure elements of different sizes
(Figure 2C). Furthermore, the selection of fragments to
inspect from within this region was somewhat arbitrary;
we selected those segments containing residue G64 due
to its significance as a functional residue [18]. We determined how many qualified hits were obtained for each
window_size/distance_cutoff combination (Figure 2B).
Parameter settings comprising window_size values ranging from 70 to 90 at distance cutoffs 3.0Å to 5.0Å gave
satisfactory results; fragments from the seeded 38 polymerase structures were reliably captured within a set of
window_size and distance_cutoff parameter value combinations within these ranges (dotted oval in Figure 2B).
Window_size values smaller than 70 tended to yield qualified hit sets missing some of the 38 polymerases (i.e.,
true positives) for lesser (more stringent) values of distance_cutoff and tended to capture increasing numbers
of unrelated (false positive) structure fragments as the
distance cutoff was increased. Also, window_size values
smaller than 70 were sensitive to the distance cutoff
value, yielding acceptable result sets only for narrow
ranges of distance cutoff. Very large window_size values
(e.g., 150) resulted in selection of all true positives for all
but the very tightest (distance_cutoff < 2.5Å) alignments.
The parameter settings highlighted in red type in Figure
2B were selected as default values for StralSV.

Analysis of poliovirus RdRp
Parameters

LGA_S cutoff 55%, and window_size/distance_cutoff combinations 50/2.5Å, 70/3.5Å, 80/4.0Å, and 90/4.0Å.

Based on parameters applied in Zemla et al. 2007 [17] and
the analysis described above, we used StralSV to analyze
sequence variability in structure context for poliovirus
RdRp (PDB: 1ra6; [19]) using minimum span length of 5,

Plotting of StralSV results

StralSV produced variability matrices and sequence profiles (not shown; for excerpts see Tables 1 and 2) from
which were extracted data for analyzing related structure

identified polymerase sequence motifs, we overlaid a plot
comprising qualified hits versus sequence position with
the positions of the well known motifs, extracted from
the literature (Figure 5, gray boxes with labels A-G). This
was accomplished by examining sequence alignments
and extracting coordinates defining the known sequence
motifs A through G from papers that included poliovirus
RdRp among the aligned sequences [21-24]. Because
there was considerable inconsistency regarding the
boundaries of the sequence motifs, we defined inclusive
boundaries for each motif whereby residues were
included if they were identified within a motif in any of
the sequence alignments reported in the literature. 3) In
order to inspect the most abundant sequence variants (i.
e., the most conserved positions) in the context of the
positional hit frequency along the reference protein, we
extracted from the matrix files the frequencies of the
most frequent residues and plotted them versus sequence
position along with the positional hits for window size 80
(Figure 5). 4) The literature was searched for evidence of
functional annotation [18,21-31] for the most frequently
observed residue positions (see additional file 2: StralSVRdRp_Suppl_Table 1) and positions for which functional
annotation was identified were marked in Figure 5.
Annotation of representative positional hits

The qualified hits (structure fragments from PDB with
detected local similarities to the query structure) for six
selected sequence positions (positional hits) of polio RdRp
(positions identified in Figure 3) were categorized and
quantified based on SCOP (Structure Classification of Proteins database; version 1.75, June 2009 release) identifiers

Page 9 of 17

[32]. Note that because SCOP is a manually curated database of structure domains from the PDB, there is some
delay (currently more than one year) before a new PDB
entry is classified in SCOP. Therefore, we have included in
Table 3 and additional files 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 (StralSVRdRp_Suppl_Table 2, StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 3,
StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 4, StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table
5, StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 6, StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 7) data pertaining to qualified hits and sequence variability based on StralSV analysis using a complete tally of
PDB identifiers in addition to those hits and variabilities
that could be categorized by SCOP classification. The hits
were evaluated separately for each of windows 50, 70, 80
and 90, at six sequence positions selected to be representative of the types of frequency variation (of qualified hits)
over the length of the polymerase (see specified positions
in Figure 3). For each of the six selected positions, the following information was extracted from the StralSV matrix
output file: all PDB templates (including chain information)
that contributed to the profile at that position, the corresponding LGA_S score, the sequence identity (Seq ID), the
number of (template) amino acids that matched the query,
the name of the corresponding amino acid of the template,
and, when available, the SCOP identifier for each classified
PDB template.

structure were plotted for window_size/distance_cutoff
parameter pairs 70/3.5Å, 80/4.0Å, and 90/4.0Å (hereafter referring only to the window_size) (Figure 3). In
some regions, there was observed considerable variation
in the numbers of positional hits captured for the different window_size settings (e.g., positions within ranges
290-310 and 390-440), whereas at other positions, window_size had little effect on the numbers of qualified
hits captured (most notably positions within ranges 1240 and 360-390). Observations of positional hit frequency variations over the length of poliovirus RdRp led
to identification of a variability profile (illustrated in Figures 3 and 5). The regions of high variability were
“locked” between regions of high specificity, which
exhibited little or no change with the variation of window_size. As window_size was increased, the numbers
of positional hits tended to decrease in those regions for
which window_size-dependent variability was observed.

Comparison of positional hit variabilities to secondary
structure (Figure 3, along x-axis) revealed that the window-related variability tended to occur in regions of
helical secondary structure. A polymerase “baseline”,
amounting to fewer than 50 positional hits (corresponding primarily to polymerase structures) was observed
along the entirety of the poliovirus chain (Figure 3 xaxis). All polymerase baseline regions, with the exception of region 410-461, were identifiable independently
of window_size. The latter C-terminal region showed
high specificity at window size 90. In this region, lowering the window_size value to just 70 resulted in the capture of many (> 900) structure fragments that have
apparent structural similarity to poliovirus RdRp (Figure
3, tall red peaks at right side of plot). The N-terminal
region of the poliovirus protein yielded the least positional hits, indicating relative structural uniqueness in
this region.

Composition of captured structure fragments at specific
positions

We selected six positions (Figure 3, residues numbered at
top of plot) at which to examine the diversity of structure
fragments captured at each of four window_size values
(Table 3, additional files 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8: StralSVRdRp_Suppl_Table 2, StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 3,
StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 4, StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table
5, StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 6, StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 7). Orientations within the structure of poliovirus RdRp
of these six positions are indicated on the structure model
shown in the inset of Figure 3. Qualified hits were examined for positions at which numbers of positional hits were
relatively invariant (D238, D328, L374) or highly variant
(N297, H398, H413) among the calculations run at the four
window_size values. (In some cases preferences for selection of a particular residue for this analysis was based on
existence of a functional annotation for that residue and,
therefore, of biological interest (e.g., D238, N297; [21,29]).
We included window_size 50 in this analysis in order to
determine what effect a very small (low stringency) window_size value might have on the structure-function diversity of qualified hits (i.e., would it greatly increase the
diversity?). For each position and each window_size, qualified hits were categorized by SCOP concise classification
strings. Hits were categorized into four families in the e.8.1
(DNA/RNA polymerases) superfamily: e.8.1.1 (DNA polymerase I), e.8.1.2 (Reverse transcriptase), e.8.1.4 (RNAdependent RNA-polymerase), and e.8.1.6 (dsRNA phage
RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase), and into various other
non-e.8 SCOP classifications.
At positions D238, D328, and L374, qualification of
structure fragments (and resulting positional hits) was
largely independent of window_size, and few unrelated
(non-e.8) fragments were captured, indicating that the
structure motifs in the surrounding regions were largely
limited to the families detected (e.g., e.8.1.4 and e.8.1.6)
(Table 3, positions D238 and D328). For positions
N297, H398, and H413, at which there was considerable
diversity in the SCOP families detected at smaller window_size values (< 90), omission of these more distantly
related positional hits was observed as window_size
increased. Overall it was observed that window_size 90
resulted predominantly in capture of structure fragments from the structure family to which poliovirus
RdRp belongs (e.8.1.4). Therefore, at all six positions,
window_size 90 effectively filtered from among the
nearly 150,000 PDB chains only those members of the
polymerase/transcriptase families.
Detection of sequence variability in structure context

To determine how sequence variability was distributed
among the e.8.1 families, we further categorized the
amino-acid variabilities by SCOP family for position

N297 at window_size 80 (Table 4). In general approximately 2/3 of the positional hits could be categorized
using SCOP; as an example, 320 of the 572 total positional hits were derived from structures that had been
classified in SCOP. For this position (at which the greatest sequence variability was observed among the 6
selected), the distribution of amino-acid variability contributed by e.8 superfamily members (e.8.1.1, 2, 4, and
6) was considerably more narrow (5 amino acids (A, F,
G, H, N), of which half (80) were N) than that observed
overall (13 amino acids). All of the positional hits that
coincided in sequence with poliovirus RdRp at N297
were members of the e.8.1.4 (RNA-dependent RNApolymerase) family, although a minority (5; all of the
remaining) of the hits (all RdRp of lambda 3) from this
family had H at position 297. Thus, sequence variability
was limited to N (94%) and H (6%) within family e.8.1.4,
in which poliovirus RdRp is categorized. (This family
also includes HCV, FM, lambda 3, BVDV, Norwalk
virus, rhinovirus, rabbit hemorrhagic fever virus, and
IBVD.) Summarizing the amino-acid occurrences among
qualified hits within fold e.8 (comprising 1 superfamily
and 4 families), we observed the following amino-acid
distributions at position N297: N = 50%, F = 26%, G =
20%, H = 3%, A = 0.6%, compared to a much broader
distribution of amino-acid variabilities observed within
templates outside of fold e.8: V = 31%, R = 31%, Q =
9%, I = 6%, H = 5%, Y = 5%, and C, E, F, K, L, M, and
T each < = 3% (comprising the “tail” in a distribution of
sequence variability). For completeness, amino-acid variabilities derived from positional hits at all six positions
examined (see Figure 3) are summarized in additional
files 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8: StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 2,
StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 3, StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 4, StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 5, StralSVRdRp_Suppl_Table 6, StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 7. Distributions of observed amino-acids are shown for all
templates and grouped as within or outside of fold e.8.
From this detailed analysis it was possible to categorize
the specific amino-acid variabilities per position–thus,
StralSV can be used to detect positional trends and
anomalies among structures related to the protein of
interest.
Effect of window_size on detection of sequence
variability

To determine how the window size parameter might
affect the detection of amino-acid variability “globally”
along the poliovirus RdRp chain, we plotted for each
position along the reference structure the detected absolute amino-acid variability versus the number of qualified
hits for window_size values 70, 80, and 90 (Figure 4). As
window_size decreased from 90 to 70, there was observed
an increase in the number of database structure

fragments that contributed positional hits, and a corresponding increase in the amino-acid variabilities: at window_size 70 there were far more (32) positions at which
all amino-acids were observed among the positional hits
compared to window_size 80 (1 position). At window_size 90 there was considerably less sequence variability
detected among the positional hits, with the most variable positions accounting for no more than 14 distinct
amino acids observed. The inset in Figure 4 displays the
data points for those positions at which the dominant
(most frequently observed) amino-acid occurred at a frequency of at least 80%. Circled data points are those corresponding to window_size 80. There was considerable
overlap among window_size values 70, 80, and 90 with

respect to positions at which the dominant residue
occurred at frequency > = 80%. Window_size 70 produced 79 positions, 80 produced 74, and 90 produced 79;
62 positions occurred in all three of these data sets. This
plot demonstrates that the most dominant amino-acid
residues occurred within the same (narrow) positional hit
frequency range (0 to < 400) regardless of window_size,
suggesting that highly conserved positions display relatively little sequence variability regardless of the selected
window_size.
Sequence and structure motifs associated with RdRps

Regions corresponding to the well-known sequence
motifs characteristic of polymerases were mapped to the

Zemla et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:226
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/226

positional hit frequency plot for window size 80 (Figure
5). As mentioned above, regions of high positional hit
frequency tended to correspond with helix secondary
structure (Figure 3), but also with defined palm-domain
motifs (Figure 5). Also plotted in Figure 5 are the frequencies of the dominant residues per position along
poliovirus RdRp (lavender plot in figure). Included are
residue-position labels for those positions at which the
dominant residue frequency exceeded 90% and for
which we were able to identify a functional annotation
in the literature (see additional file 2: StralSVRdRp_Suppl_Table 1). Although there is no clear criterion for identifying functional residues and short
sequence or structure motifs based on StralSV profiles,
it was evident that functionally relevant residues tended
to emerge when selecting those positions displaying
high degrees of conservation in structure context.
Furthermore, lowering the window size to just 70
resulted in the capture of many structure fragments
with common structure motifs (see last 3 maxima in
Figure 3 graph and Table 3 “other” column for positions
H398 and H413), implying that StralSV may enable
identification of common structure motifs shared among
distantly related proteins.

Discussion
StralSV differs in several respects from other sequenceand structure-based algorithms for comparing proteins.
First, by applying an overlapping sliding window to define
segments of a structure of interest, the algorithm avoids
the pitfalls of algorithms that compare proteins at a global level: by dividing a protein into segments, StralSV
enables comparison of structures by using fragments corresponding approximately in size to super-secondary elements or structure motifs. In this way, portions of a
structure can be compared at a local level to like fragments in the PDB without losing the greater structural
context. StralSV applies a two-step approach to filtering
PDB fragments in order to select those which are most
likely to be relevant for a meaningful comparison. For
example, the results presented in Tables 3 and 4 and
additional files 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8: StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 2, StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 3, StralSVRdRp_Suppl_Table 4, StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 5,
StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 6, StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 7, illustrate how StralSV can be used to quantify and
annotate sequence variability among structure fragments
that form tight local alignments (determined by span and
distance_cutoff parameters), yet have sufficient structure
context (determined by window_size) to filter out unrelated fragments. Larger window_size values effectively
increase the stringency with which structure fragments
are selected, whereas smaller distance_cutoff values also
increase this stringency, but more locally, by enforcing

Page 13 of 17

tighter local alignments. As seen in Table 3, considerably
fewer fragments are selected at window_size 90 than with
smaller window_size values for those positions that are
sensitive to window_size, but the result set is greatly
enriched for fragments that are closely related to the
reference structure (i.e., polio RdRp). How much stringency the user wishes to apply in running StralSV may
depend on one’s research interest and the protein being
studied. Smaller window_size (as well as greater distance_cutoff) parameter values will result in capture of more
structure fragments, many of which will be from structures that are more distantly related in terms of their
SCOP classification and the taxonomy of the organisms
that they are from (Table 5). It must be noted that as the
window_size (or distance_cutoff) parameter is relaxed,
more “noise” arises in the result set; however, at the same
time there is potential for discovering structural relationships and sequence laxity that may not otherwise be discernable when comparing only closely related structures.
Effects of parameter setting on capture of database
structure fragments

Not unexpectedly, the frequencies of positional hits tend
toward maxima in regions of helical secondary structure,
and as window_size is decreased the numbers of positional hits tend to increase (Figures 3, 5). Reduction in
window_size relaxes constraints on the alignment, and
therefore smaller fragments may align more tightly,
thereby meeting the distance cutoff. In some regions, the
numbers of positional hits do not change significantly
with changes in window_size (e.g., peaks up to position
240 and 360-390), indicating that in certain regions there
exist conserved structure motifs that are shared only
among a specific set of structures. For example, there is
observed in the N-terminal regions up to approximately
position 140 (Figures 3, 5) a “polymerase baseline”, which
appears to be structurally unique. This region is external
to the catalytic tunnel of the polymerase, and may define

structural and functional specificity for polio and related
viruses. Window_size 90 produced a polymerase baseline
in the C-terminal region as well, although here the positional hit frequency was highly sensitive to window_size.
It may be that only window_size 90 (or greater) effectively filtered out non-polymerase structure fragments
due to the stringency enforced by context, as it appeared
that smaller segments of polio RdRp in this region
resembled short segments in distantly related proteins.
We observed considerable diversity among the SCOP
families represented by fragments detected at different
positions at window_size values less than 90 (N297,
H398, H413). This demonstrated a clear filtering of these
positional hits as the window_size increased. One must
be aware, however, that the two parameters, window_size
and distance_cutoff, have an opposing relationship with
respect to qualifying a hit: increase in alignment stringency is achieved by increasing window_size, but also by
decreasing distance_cutoff. As window_size is decreased,
it is necessary to also reduce the distance_cutoff in order
to avoid an unacceptable increase in the number of “false
positive” (considerably less structurally relevant) fragments captured. We achieved a reasonable selection
of window-size/distance-cutoff parameter pairings by
examining the relationship between these parameters
(Figure 2). The apparent (perhaps unexpected) decrease
in the numbers of non-e.8 structure fragments captured
by window 50 compared to window 70 at positions N297
and H398 (Table 3 “Other” column) are explained by the
high-stringency filtering achieved by the distance cutoff
2.5 Å applied at window 50. Thus, it is desirable to strike
a balance between window size and distance cutoff. Small
window_size values are useful for capturing shorter fragments, but to ensure that the result set is not populated
by spurious hits corresponding to ubiquitous secondary
structure elements (e.g., alpha helix), one must apply
added stringency at the level of distance_cutoff. Smaller
window_size values are appropriate when the user is
interested in focusing the analysis on a relatively small
structure motif, which may occur with or without the
surrounding structural context in the reference structure.
In capturing these smaller structure fragments, one is
cautioned to enforce tighter alignments in order to assure
that the resulting qualified hits are relevant to the study.
Detection of Sequence Motifs

Regions corresponding to the well-known sequence
motifs A-G, characteristic of polymerases, were mapped
to the positional hit frequency plot for window size 80
(Figure 5). All categories of polymerase (RdRp, RdDp/RT,
DdRp, DdDp) are recognized to contain sequence motifs
A-D. Identification of motifs E, F, and G, however, has
been somewhat obscured by the greater diversity among
sequences assigned to these structure motifs. O’Reilley

Page 14 of 17

and Kao [23] reported motif E as being exclusive to
RdDps and RdRps, and motifs F [22,24] and G [24] were
identified in poliovirus RdRp. Motif F was identified in
phi6 [33], BVDV and HCV [34], reovirus, phi6, BVDV,
HCV, rhinovirus, Norwalk virus, and HIV [35], and
FMDV, RHDV, and HIV1 [36]. A detailed structurebased comparison of these polymerases using StralSV
may clarify the assignment of motifs A-G among the
polymerase classes.
Detection of sequence variability in structure context

In examining the amino-acid variability versus qualified
hit frequency (Figure 4 inset, circled data points) for 11
highly conserved positions (Figure 5 dots) that had been
functionally annotated (see additional file 2: StralSVRdRp_Suppl_Table 1), it appeared that the numbers of
positional hits and the degree of amino-acid variability
observed for high-frequency positions was largely independent of window_size. This implies (at least for the
positions that were examined in this study) that the
functionally relevant positions are consistently detected
as high-frequency-residue positions regardless of window_size. Therefore, the StralSV algorithm is sufficiently
sensitive to detect structurally or functionally conserved
residues even when the parameters may not be perfectly
tuned.
StralSV is especially useful for identifying highly conserved residues at positions that occur in regions in
which there are large numbers of positional hits; dominant residue frequency cannot be considered significant
in regions of structural conservation (e.g., the N-terminal
region up to about position 140 in poliovirus RdRp),
whereas identification of dominant residues occurring
with high frequency at positions with large numbers of
positional hits may help identify residues at positions
that are structurally and/or functionally significant. For
example, more than 250 positional hits contributed to
residue counts at positions D233 and D328 (window_size
80, Figure 5), known to be critical for RdRp function.
Aspartic acid occurred at close to 100% frequency at
these positions. The structure fragments contributing to
these data points comprised RdRps and dsRNA phage
polymerases (SCOP family e.8.1.4). The combination of
many positional hits and low amino acid variability may
provide a means of identifying key functional residues.
Because the ability to detect possibly functional residues is of particular interest in protein functional annotation, we compared the results obtained using StralSV to
those of another bioinformatics tool [37]. FireStar uses
alignments to identify functional residues based on close
atomic contacts in PDB structures and annotated residues in the Catalytic Site Atlas (CSA). We ran poliovirus
RdRp (PDB: 1ra6) through the online FireStar server
(data not shown), and found considerable overlap

Zemla et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2011, 12:226
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/226

between the functional residue list generated by FireStar
and the list of 90% dominance residues generated by
StralSV (see additional file 2: StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table
1): K158, K167, R174, D233, D238, G289, and K359.
StralSV identified the more broadly conserved residues
within the functional set identified by FireStar. A main
difference between the two approaches is that FireStar
identifies functional residues involved in ligand binding–
some being highly conserved and others displaying considerable sequence variability. In particular we note
N297, which is determined by FireStar to be associated
with binding of cytidine-s-triphosphate and uridine-smonophosphate (sites 2 and 3). StralSV identified N297
as a residue that displays some degree of conservation,
but also quantified the degree of conservation at this
position across a wide range of structures (see additional
file 4: StralSV-RdRp_Suppl_Table 3). Furthermore,
StralSV is not limited to identification of residues that
have been associated with a binding site, but can be used
to infer structure and/or functional significance based on
sequence conservation in structure context regardless of
pre-existing annotation information.
Additional applications of StralSV

Results from StralSV analysis can be used to characterize residue positions in a reference protein by detection
of similar locations in other proteins (sometimes from
quite distant organisms and different assigned structure
classifications), in which corresponding residue positions
within similar structural motifs are observed. Such analyses may potentiate rapid identification of invariant (as
well as unusual or unexpected) residues, which in many
cases are essential to a protein’s function. It also may
enlighten studies of newly discovered natural or engineered mutations that have not yet been observed in the
sequence databases. Results from StralSV structure similarity searches performed against large sets of structurally related proteins can facilitate refinement of
constructed homology models by suggesting corrections
to the query-template alignments (using an approach
similar to that of [2]) or by providing a list of possible
conformational variants of corresponding structural
fragments for loop-building procedures. Calculated residue-residue correspondences can be used to evaluate
pure sequence alignment methods and also to derive
structural environment-specific substitution matrices,
which have been shown to be useful for detection of
remote homologs [38]. When applied to experimentally
solved structures, StralSV also could facilitate identification of structural motifs (local conformations) that have
not yet been observed in PDB. Such findings could aid
in the discovery of previously unidentified structural
motifs or suggest refinement of constructed structural
models in particular regions.

Conclusions
StralSV is a new algorithm for detecting closely related
structure fragments from a structure database (PDB or
user-defined) and quantifying residue frequency from
tight local structure alignments. Input parameters to
StralSV (window_size, distance_cutoff, or span_size) can
be varied in order to adjust the stringency with which
structure fragments are selected or with which local
alignments are made, thereby providing the user with
flexibility in detecting similar structure fragments. Highstringency parameter settings will effectively filter out all
but highly structurally similar fragments and will impose
very tight local alignments, whereas low-stringency parameters will enable detection of more distantly related
structures, which may be of interest, for example, when
the user wishes to detect distant evolutionary relationships among proteins or to test the range of possible
sequence variability that might be expected to be tolerated within a given structure motif. It should be emphasized, however, that StralSV safeguards against
degradation of sequence variability data quality by enforcing structure context upon local alignments in a twostep process of identifying “qualified” hits.
It has long been recognized that peptides with very
different sequences may have similar tertiary structures.
In this work we applied StralSV in a study of the RNAdependent RNA polymerase of poliovirus and demonstrated that the algorithm could be used to determine
regions of the protein that were relatively unique (e.g.,
the N-terminal region) or that shared structural similarity (e.g., C-terminal motifs) with structures that were
distantly related (non-e.8 SCOP classifications), and that
by quantifying residue frequencies among many (hundreds or even thousands) of residue-residue pairs
extracted from local alignments, one can infer potential
structural or functional importance of specific residues
that are determined to be highly conserved or that deviate from a consensus. We further demonstrated that
considerable detailed structural and phylogenetic information can be derived from StralSV profiles.
